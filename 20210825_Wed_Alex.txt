[00:00.000 --> 00:26.600]  It's Wednesday August 25th the year is 2021 and what an incredibly exciting and dangerous
[00:26.600 --> 00:35.960]  time to be alive I am your host Alex Jones and we have world exclusive information so powerful
[00:37.000 --> 00:43.560]  so over the top that I've got a frog in my throat and I'm having basically an anxiety attack
[00:43.560 --> 00:48.200]  unable to even cover it at this point and I've been on there 27 years that might have happened
[00:48.200 --> 00:54.200]  five times I was less nervous watching my children be born this is such an incredible time we're in
[00:54.200 --> 01:00.920]  we've passed the point of no return I have been doing a lot of preparations today and I got so
[01:00.920 --> 01:04.920]  busy I didn't have time to go out there during the beginning of the show and write the live show
[01:04.920 --> 01:08.920]  headline that we put out every day that kind of gives you a flavor what the main theme of the
[01:08.920 --> 01:15.880]  transmission is and I'm just sitting back thinking about how huge this is and I don't know how to
[01:15.880 --> 01:19.960]  phrase it but we have all the evidence we have all the documentation we have all the background
[01:19.960 --> 01:27.800]  on and we know what's going on and we know that it is the vaccinated though the majority of the
[01:27.800 --> 01:34.120]  sick and dying and the ones releasing and sloughing these new variants and I've got a ton
[01:34.120 --> 01:42.200]  of mainline science and documents and news proving that and we also know that it's not just the
[01:42.200 --> 01:47.240]  quote delta variant out there but that they have the smart money believes and people I really trust
[01:47.240 --> 01:55.000]  released out of a laboratory what they're calling SARS-4 and that's why the vaccine is 100% ineffective
[01:55.640 --> 02:01.880]  whether it's the Pfizer or the Moderna or the J&J or the AstraZeneca or any of it
[02:03.880 --> 02:09.880]  and so this is a big big deal and I talk to people all over the country all over the world
[02:09.880 --> 02:18.440]  things are coming to a standstill half the warehouses and other businesses and even public
[02:18.440 --> 02:23.560]  schools are having trouble reopening because so many people are sick from the inoculations in
[02:23.560 --> 02:31.800]  fact I actually covered this some on the show yesterday we had a guest on a PhD educator who
[02:31.800 --> 02:35.880]  was exposing the fact that a lot of schools around the country this year couldn't open
[02:35.880 --> 02:42.680]  because so many of the people were sick when they started taking the inoculations
[02:43.320 --> 02:47.000]  in January and February and that those numbers are continuing I mean it's just
[02:47.800 --> 02:55.880]  unbelievable but the big news is I've talked to a lot of really smart people a lot of medical
[02:55.880 --> 03:01.480]  doctors a lot of people in high level and former high level in US intelligence agencies
[03:01.480 --> 03:08.360]  and others and they've all concurred with the fact that this is an ongoing globalist bio attack
[03:08.920 --> 03:14.040]  and that we're facing a cocktail of attacks and that's actually what the universities and other
[03:14.600 --> 03:22.600]  researchers are finding so before we get into all of that let me just show you something from
[03:22.600 --> 03:33.480]  the vault here this is Fauci in March of 2020 18 months ago 19 months ago Fauci already knew
[03:33.480 --> 03:39.320]  about antibody dependent enhancement and briefed about it in March of 2020 press briefing
[03:40.040 --> 03:46.760]  ADE how vaccines can enhance the disease and make things worse and that's one of the things we see
[03:46.760 --> 03:52.520]  causing these problems and now our own Helen McBreen discovered yesterday
[03:55.400 --> 03:59.560]  that and nobody else discovered this that they're not counting people
[04:00.200 --> 04:06.520]  that have had the vaccine who die as if they had the vaccine they just say they don't so the numbers
[04:06.520 --> 04:12.040]  are even higher wait till we show you all this it's just over the top let's break with Fauci
[04:12.040 --> 04:18.200]  saying the vaccine can be worse than the disease the issue of safety something that i want to make
[04:18.200 --> 04:24.280]  sure the american public understand it's not only safety when you inject somebody and they get
[04:24.280 --> 04:28.680]  maybe an idiosyncratic reaction they get a little allergic reaction they get pain
[04:29.240 --> 04:35.720]  there's safety associated does the vaccine make you worse and there are diseases in which you
[04:35.720 --> 04:41.080]  vaccinate someone they get infected with what you're trying to protect them with and you actually
[04:41.080 --> 04:47.080]  enhance the infection you can get a good feel for that in animal models so that's going to be
[04:47.080 --> 04:52.120]  interspersed at the same time that we're testing while you're testing on the general public and
[04:52.120 --> 04:58.920]  skip the animal models because you'd already secretly done animal models not all vitamin and
[04:58.920 --> 05:04.440]  mineral supplements are equal many of them are synthetic many of them have fillers and additives
[05:04.440 --> 05:09.160]  many of them just pass right through the body and are absorbed but that's not the case with our
[05:09.160 --> 05:14.360]  incredibly popular because it's so effective product that has now been sold out for months but
[05:14.360 --> 05:20.760]  it's finally back in scone and that is vitamin mineral fusion all the essential vitamins all
[05:20.760 --> 05:25.880]  the essential minerals a bunch of chemino acids help it upload better into your body and your cells
[05:25.880 --> 05:30.680]  gets in powder form straight for children it's great for adults it's really important for folks
[05:30.680 --> 05:35.640]  that are older because they don't absorb as well through their guts so this liquid formula really
[05:35.640 --> 05:40.680]  really does it you mix up a picture of it every couple days put it in the refrigerator or keep it
[05:40.680 --> 05:45.320]  out in the kitchen and just remember to drink it in the morning and in the evening it tastes great
[05:45.320 --> 05:52.280]  it makes your body healthy it boosts your immune system and it funds the info war a true 361 so
[05:52.280 --> 05:57.080]  vitamin mineral fusion sold out for months is back in stock for a limited time 33 off in full
[05:57.080 --> 06:08.040]  war store go waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[06:08.040 --> 06:16.440]  the info war all right i have confirmed with multiple former heads of us intelligence agencies
[06:17.640 --> 06:21.640]  but there is a multinational bio attack happening on the united states
[06:21.640 --> 06:29.560]  right now and that multiple deadly viruses one of them sars four has been released in the last
[06:29.560 --> 06:34.840]  three months in the united states to bring us down a year ago i told you that they were counting
[06:34.840 --> 06:40.520]  everybody that was dying of heart attacks and car wrecks and gunshot wounds and pneumonia and the
[06:40.520 --> 06:47.640]  flu as covid that was basically overblown bs but covid was a real virus a new chimera that they
[06:47.640 --> 06:54.440]  could own to then roll out a vaccine against it that would actually cause a live virus event and
[06:54.440 --> 07:00.520]  massive shedding well i've known this for a few weeks and mike adams has alluded to it as well
[07:00.520 --> 07:07.640]  for miss sources and deep research but i in the last 48 hours have talked to a lot of high-level
[07:07.640 --> 07:15.160]  sources who have confirmed with current high-level individuals at fort detrick maryland and in the
[07:15.160 --> 07:22.760]  pentagon and an inner pole that major universities are being told to suppress the isolated viruses
[07:22.760 --> 07:31.640]  they found that are sars four and i already knew this information again a few weeks ago
[07:31.640 --> 07:36.280]  i got more information a week ago and then i got even more information last night and it was from
[07:36.280 --> 07:43.240]  basically the same quarters and so this is a serious bio weapon attack on the united states
[07:43.240 --> 07:47.800]  ladies and gentlemen we're not sure how they're releasing it maybe in air conditioning systems
[07:47.800 --> 07:54.120]  at grocery stores shopping malls but they are definitely deploying it probably at airports
[07:54.920 --> 07:59.800]  and this is the takedown of america we're at war with china and china sympathizers
[08:00.680 --> 08:06.760]  and it is biden's job to basically collapse the u.s empire bankrupt the u.s dollar bankrupt the
[08:06.760 --> 08:14.120]  middle class bankrupt small landlords and then have a permanent socialist communist class
[08:14.120 --> 08:18.200]  that will burn the cities down they're not giving all the free goodies i'm going to be talking more
[08:18.200 --> 08:25.720]  about that coming up at the bottom of the hour and folks know i don't just say things to sound
[08:25.720 --> 08:31.480]  official and stuff like that cue crap but i tell you i got intel and i got research it's
[08:31.480 --> 08:36.680]  bonafide i make a mistake about two percent of the time about 98 percent of the time we're dead on
[08:36.680 --> 08:41.480]  and believe me i wish i was wrong about this we are not wrong so you to get ready to start
[08:41.480 --> 08:47.640]  burying a lot of your family you need to get yourselves healthy as fast as you can and you
[08:47.640 --> 08:52.360]  got to get ready for the total breakdown of society and civilization because if you thought the
[08:52.360 --> 08:58.520]  supply chains went down the last year and a half this is the beginning of the end and i'm not somebody
[08:58.520 --> 09:03.720]  to be negative i'm just going to be honest with you that you better brace for impact when i said
[09:03.720 --> 09:10.760]  the end the end of the world as we know it don't need to worry about that mortgage anymore don't
[09:10.760 --> 09:15.640]  need to worry about the stupid neighbor that dog craps in your yard i wouldn't be worried about the
[09:15.640 --> 09:21.640]  401k you better be worried about getting ready and getting right with jesus because this is it
[09:21.640 --> 09:28.120]  china is going to invade taiwan a whole nine yards we're going to be busy over here dying
[09:29.960 --> 09:35.400]  and the enemies are not taking the shot because they know that's what gives it to you
[09:36.680 --> 09:41.080]  that's why they're saying get your third shot well they take the third shot that's when the
[09:41.080 --> 09:45.560]  really deadly mutations start being released they've already tested all these viruses and
[09:45.560 --> 09:50.040]  they know how they mutate in the body to actually mutate to be more deadly and more contagious
[09:50.040 --> 09:55.400]  so they're using us as the factories to release it but they're also releasing novel viruses
[09:55.400 --> 10:02.840]  themselves we are under full bio weapon attack just like we're under full fentanyl attack just
[10:02.840 --> 10:11.160]  like they're collapsing afghanistan collapsing the family they are coming for you now as usual the
[10:11.160 --> 10:15.240]  left hand doesn't know what the right hand's doing there's a lot of good medicine in this country a
[10:15.240 --> 10:20.280]  lot of good doctors in this country a lot of good people that are operating on their own track you
[10:20.280 --> 10:23.560]  have the evil track and the good track and then the track of people that don't know what they're
[10:23.560 --> 10:29.320]  doing that are the majority three tracks the idiots the good guys and the bad guys it's not
[10:29.320 --> 10:37.400]  the good the bad the ugly it's the good the bad and the asleep and all hell's breaking loose
[10:38.680 --> 10:42.040]  want to play part of tucker carlson last night talking about how the globalists want you to
[10:42.040 --> 10:47.800]  be a slave and keep your mouth shut because it's an important piece plus i've got one more phone
[10:47.800 --> 10:53.000]  colony to make before i talk about this and then we're gonna come back and hit it all today you
[10:53.000 --> 10:58.600]  do not want to miss this broadcast i suggest you tell everybody you know tune in right now but again
[10:58.600 --> 11:06.440]  the most important thing is getting right with god okay here's tucker carlson good evening and
[11:06.440 --> 11:12.280]  welcome to tucker carlson tonight ever get the feeling we've been here before oh we have at the
[11:12.280 --> 11:18.680]  height of the worst pandemic in american history that would be the spanish flu of 1918 cities across
[11:18.680 --> 11:23.800]  america did something that the rest of us would find familiar today they issued mandatory mask
[11:23.800 --> 11:30.120]  mandates and they punished anyone who didn't comply quote the man or woman or child who will
[11:30.120 --> 11:35.640]  not wear a mask now is a dangerous slacker reads a typical announcement from the red cross at the
[11:35.640 --> 11:41.880]  time the city of san francisco took these rules very seriously so seriously that a city health
[11:41.880 --> 11:46.920]  agent in san francisco shot a man who refused to wear a mask he hit the two bystanders who happened
[11:46.920 --> 11:52.920]  to be standing behind the man now that seemed a bit much to some people but many other people
[11:52.920 --> 11:57.400]  thought it was fine they went along with it they were very afraid of the virus they wanted to do
[11:57.400 --> 12:02.200]  their part to stop it but most of all they trusted their leaders and if their leaders put a mandate
[12:02.200 --> 12:08.840]  in place they assumed it was for a good reason and they wanted to help and then a single picture
[12:08.840 --> 12:14.280]  changed everything a photographer who happened to be attending a boxing match in san francisco
[12:14.280 --> 12:18.760]  snapped a shot of several high-ranking city officials that would include the mayor of
[12:18.760 --> 12:23.640]  san francisco a member of congress a senior health administrator all sitting at the event
[12:24.280 --> 12:30.600]  all completely unmasked the photograph went national americans were shocked to discover
[12:30.600 --> 12:36.920]  that the people making and enforcing the rules had no intention of following those rules within a
[12:36.920 --> 12:42.600]  short period mask mandates across the country ended it turns out the public was willing to endure
[12:42.600 --> 12:51.000]  inconvenience but not hypocrisy this country is facing a similar moment again now once again
[12:51.000 --> 12:56.200]  officials in california have been caught on camera exposing their own contempt for their
[12:56.200 --> 13:02.200]  own public health measures this is footage shot at a democratic fundraiser yesterday morning in
[13:02.200 --> 13:06.680]  napa napa valley that's just north of san francisco nancy polosi was there she's got an
[13:06.680 --> 13:11.800]  estate right nearby so where other democratic officials and the party's biggest donors they
[13:11.800 --> 13:18.440]  paid 30 000 per ticket to be there now looking at the picture the first thing you notice about the
[13:18.440 --> 13:24.280]  group other than how strikingly homogenous and non-diverse it is is that none of them are wearing
[13:24.280 --> 13:31.880]  masks they're breathing all the fresh air they like as if it's 2019 again the only people there
[13:31.880 --> 13:37.560]  who are wearing masks are their servants the faceless brown serfs scurrying back and forth
[13:37.560 --> 13:42.280]  to bring them things there's nothing worse than having to help breathe on you but that's not a
[13:42.280 --> 14:02.600]  problem for nancy polosi as you can see it's repulsive but revealing it's pretty clear at
[14:02.600 --> 14:09.800]  this point that nancy polosi our chief coveted enforcer doesn't believe a word she says about
[14:09.800 --> 14:15.400]  the virus now polosi is 81 years old that's deep in the risk range for coronavirus she's
[14:15.400 --> 14:21.560]  standing at a crowded event in napa which according to the by demonstrations color-coded map of the
[14:21.560 --> 14:27.720]  country is one of the riskiest places in america for coronavirus transmission and yet polosi is
[14:27.720 --> 14:34.600]  not social distancing she's not wearing a face shield she doesn't even have a mask on why is that
[14:34.600 --> 14:40.360]  well clearly she understands she's not in danger and since there are no republicans present she
[14:40.360 --> 14:46.600]  has no reason to pretend otherwise as a reminder here's what nancy polosi sounds like when she's
[14:46.600 --> 14:54.760]  back in washington members and staff will be required to wear masks at all times this is a mask
[14:56.440 --> 15:02.680]  from all over the country i'm getting these masks real men wear masks and these masks are
[15:02.680 --> 15:09.880]  essentially important the chair views the failure to wear a mask as a serious breach of decorum i
[15:09.880 --> 15:14.120]  had no advice for them except when they come here they have to wear a mask but in any case
[15:15.320 --> 15:22.120]  i'm a big believer in wearing the mask and not sharing any shall we say air unnecessarily
[15:24.360 --> 15:30.520]  yeah so the real justification for mask mandates was right in the middle of that montage of clips
[15:30.520 --> 15:38.440]  quote failure to wear a mask is a serious breach of decorum nancy polosi says and she means it and
[15:38.440 --> 15:45.880]  that's why in napah her little brown servants wear masks as they bring her wine decorum demands that
[15:45.880 --> 15:52.440]  they do if there has ever been a clear window into their plans into the society they are trying to
[15:52.440 --> 15:58.120]  build now we're not aware of it hold your eye back stay with us if you're concerned about the power

[18:03.160 --> 18:09.480]  paradigm they are discovering the globalist the elites the manipulation the cfr the trilateral
[18:09.480 --> 18:16.520]  commission the bill de berg group the bohemian grove the club of rome and so even though it
[18:16.520 --> 18:22.200]  seems like the globalists are winning the truth is they've had to come out the open to attack
[18:22.200 --> 18:28.840]  human freedom because they're actually losing we have forced them out in the open so as bad as
[18:28.840 --> 18:34.120]  these times are a lot of negative things are about to happen realize humanity is winning you've
[18:34.120 --> 18:41.000]  got to trust in the plan of god and trust in the plan of god's justice that is invincible that is
[18:41.000 --> 18:47.960]  ethereal timeless and unstoppable so don't trust in man trust in god to lead god and director soul
[18:47.960 --> 18:52.360]  and then take action against the globalist and realize you've got my commitment from alex jones
[18:52.360 --> 18:59.320]  and my crew to you we will never back down from the globalist and we will never surrender humanity
[18:59.320 --> 19:04.200]  is the main stakeholder on this plan but the big corporations for a hundred years have told us that
[19:04.200 --> 19:08.920]  humans are bad and evil and a pestilence on the earth so that we begin to believe we're bad and
[19:08.920 --> 19:14.200]  we'll turn off our life force and let the eugenics-based globalists take control of the planet if you
[19:14.200 --> 19:19.400]  let a clown swab the etherealist group's own wikipedia page he brags on there about how
[19:19.400 --> 19:24.440]  they're capturing democracy and taking over governments worldwide to set up corporate
[19:24.440 --> 19:31.480]  dictatorship under the un they admit all of this they plan the lockdowns they release the viruses
[19:31.480 --> 19:36.920]  they think you're stupid and their plan is to slowly cut off the resources so they can dictate
[19:36.920 --> 19:42.440]  total social control over you and your lives that's how i was able to predict everything they did
[19:43.000 --> 19:49.640]  decades before they executed it word for word with total precision because they have a detailed
[19:49.640 --> 19:55.160]  battle plan we cover it live weekdays 11 a.m. with 3 p.m at info wars dot com four slash show
[19:55.160 --> 19:57.400]  tell everybody to tune in now and war the world
[19:57.400 --> 20:09.240]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[20:28.280 --> 20:37.720]  well you said it a man and his will to survive you better decide you want to survive now
[20:38.600 --> 20:41.800]  because the globalists took the planet over by fractures they're making it fraud
[20:42.520 --> 20:47.880]  they put hitler in they put linen and stalling in they put malin they put fidel castro and
[20:47.880 --> 20:54.200]  higo chavez in they put jessinger doe in and they took over the planet by fraud and we tried to
[20:54.200 --> 21:00.120]  take it back the populism and brings it and trump and balson arrow and they said no you don't
[21:00.680 --> 21:06.280]  we're going to hit you with a bio weapon and that'll sure change the subject and then they bring
[21:06.280 --> 21:11.240]  you the vaccine that lowers your regular immunity puts off mutants and now i've got a stack of new
[21:11.240 --> 21:18.040]  stories next segment about polio's back and all these weird viruses are killing people that aren't
[21:18.040 --> 21:23.880]  coveted why is there's record illness because they've released the plagues on us
[21:26.280 --> 21:30.920]  and the bottom line is the vaccine lowers your immunity so it can take your body over and kill
[21:30.920 --> 21:36.040]  you and i've got the articles right here majority of the deaths in hospitals the vaccinated and that's
[21:36.040 --> 21:41.160]  even when we caught them removing a large number of the vaccinated deaths from the rolls
[21:41.160 --> 21:45.400]  an exclusive article by kella Mcbrane last night and i'm going to ask we repost
[21:45.400 --> 21:50.840]  to the front page of info wars dot com but but let me just start over here because i literally
[21:50.840 --> 21:58.040]  have hundreds of articles documenting all this let's play fouchy from march of last year how
[21:58.040 --> 22:06.520]  many months ago is that that's a lot of months ago over a year and a half ago and here is
[22:06.520 --> 22:16.120]  is fouchy talking about antibody issues antibody dependent enhancement is one of the main things
[22:16.120 --> 22:21.240]  killing people that after you take a shot if you ever come in contact with a virus like it
[22:21.880 --> 22:28.120]  you have a horrible autoimmune response and your body attacks itself and your organs liquefy but
[22:28.120 --> 22:33.320]  don't believe me here he is now the issue of safety something that i want to make sure the
[22:33.320 --> 22:39.640]  american public understand it's not only safety when you inject somebody and they get maybe an
[22:39.640 --> 22:46.120]  idiosyncratic reaction they get a little allergic reaction they get pain their safety associated
[22:46.120 --> 22:52.120]  does the vaccine make you worse and there are diseases in which you vaccinate someone they
[22:52.120 --> 22:57.800]  get infected with what you're trying to protect them with and you actually enhance the infection
[22:57.800 --> 23:03.240]  you can get a good feel for that in animal models so that's going to be interspersed at the same
[23:03.240 --> 23:08.520]  time that we're testing we're going to try and make sure we don't have enhancement so the worst
[23:08.520 --> 23:14.200]  possible thing you could do is vaccinate somebody to prevent infection and actually make them worse
[23:14.200 --> 23:17.400]  and that's what all the scientists say has happened but now he doesn't want to discuss it
[23:17.400 --> 23:21.480]  because they skipped the animal trials and went right to the general public and now the fda won't
[23:21.480 --> 23:26.520]  release any of the trials that they've done in the last eight nine months here or in england
[23:26.520 --> 23:30.840]  they said they'll release it in 2025 and then they'll back it up it'll be like the kennedy
[23:30.840 --> 23:36.360]  assassination files are folks tracking this but see the left just dumps it down to save lives take
[23:36.360 --> 23:42.840]  the shots save lives it doesn't it doesn't protect you we're going to document it all here in a moment
[23:42.840 --> 23:51.240]  but here is dr satchak bhakti speaks with dr mccola about india less than 10 or vaccinated
[23:51.240 --> 23:56.680]  there last time i checked and they have way way lower death and illness rates than we do and it's
[23:56.680 --> 24:02.040]  the vax people that are actually having the problems in india here it is anyway so we've got
[24:02.040 --> 24:06.360]  the experience with israel and they are getting i believe most of the people the cases there are
[24:06.360 --> 24:11.080]  people have been vaccinated and india has hardly anyone immunized i i don't know whether this
[24:11.080 --> 24:15.560]  this current system is very low it's well under 25 percent maybe it's lowest 10 percent and we're
[24:15.560 --> 24:22.120]  not seeing a lot of cases in india at all well um i talked to indian colleagues a couple of weeks
[24:22.120 --> 24:26.600]  okay so why don't you i want to update us on your perspective on that and and and they said that in
[24:27.320 --> 24:33.160]  of course less than 10 of india's vaccinated but there are a lot of indians you know yeah
[24:33.160 --> 24:40.760]  over a billion yes so so uh you know if a hundred million have been vaccinated that's a damn lot
[24:40.760 --> 24:51.240]  and they are in fact seeing very severe cases very severe cases of true corona infections um
[24:52.040 --> 25:01.000]  and they are among the vaccinated so what we're witnessing in in india and probably also in israel
[25:01.640 --> 25:09.160]  is the immune dependent enhancement of disease which we have always warned against
[25:09.160 --> 25:18.040]  uh you know um together with doris cahill um a long time ago and and i think also in our book
[25:20.200 --> 25:26.920]  it's bound to happen so the people who are getting vaccinated now have to be fearful
[25:26.920 --> 25:36.040]  of the next wave of genuine infections whether it's corona COVID-19 relatives or not or any
[25:36.040 --> 25:43.800]  other coronaviruses because they're all related and they will all be subject uh to immune dependent
[25:43.800 --> 25:49.800]  enhancement obviously and they knew exactly what they were doing but instead i did have time to
[25:49.800 --> 25:53.800]  watch the whole last hour this morning i just got sent the clips i watched one half of a young
[25:53.800 --> 26:00.440]  turks clip where they literally call me a murderer and say why won't he follow science why is he
[26:00.440 --> 26:08.680]  telling people don't take the shot it's 100% no it's 39% phyzer claims now and then the majority
[26:08.680 --> 26:13.240]  of deaths are people in the hospital took the phyzer i have the damn graphs i'll show them to
[26:13.240 --> 26:18.040]  your next segment but see they don't show you graphs on the young turks they're just george
[26:18.040 --> 26:26.680]  soros funded punks they just sit up there and say i'm a murderer i just showed you fouchy
[26:26.680 --> 26:33.000]  i just showed you other medical doctors saying the same damn thing and i've got all the articles and
[26:33.000 --> 26:39.960]  all the proof right here they knew when they did this what was going to happen and they're also
[26:39.960 --> 26:45.240]  going oh jones said this wasn't a big threat and everybody's getting sick really yeah like i predicted
[26:45.240 --> 26:50.600]  after you take the injections but it's worse than that china and the globals are making their move
[26:50.600 --> 26:55.080]  they plan to bring the us down they want to get us all dependent and universal income get rid of
[26:55.080 --> 27:01.480]  the rent so black rock and the chinese can buy everything up and this is the takedown more lockdowns
[27:01.480 --> 27:06.680]  are coming there's so much pressure on biden they haven't officially announced it yet but that's the
[27:06.680 --> 27:13.480]  plan and this is the breaking of the country and i don't sit up here and issue dire emergency
[27:13.480 --> 27:17.640]  warnings for no reason i'm the one a year and a half ago telling you this is overblown hype
[27:17.640 --> 27:25.480]  this virus is man-made and it does have gain of function but it doesn't replicate very fast
[27:26.040 --> 27:29.720]  and that's what i'm telling you two months ago well everybody's sick this is real and we predicted
[27:29.720 --> 27:34.040]  all that you heard us predicted you heard the scientists we had on predicted you just heard
[27:34.040 --> 27:39.160]  them predict why it's the antibody dependent enhancements one of the big ones but there's
[27:39.160 --> 27:45.000]  also the shedding and then and by the way i don't just have sources telling me this i can see it i
[27:45.000 --> 27:49.640]  read hundreds of articles a day there's all these new weird viruses they won't even they're like we
[27:49.640 --> 27:53.560]  don't know what it's like polio but it's not oh and there's some other thing killing babies and we
[27:53.560 --> 28:01.480]  don't know we don't know why suddenly everybody's dying because of the mutants because the mutant
[28:01.480 --> 28:07.160]  viruses that come off of this but then fouchy goes on tv yes dangles oh it's the unvaccinated
[28:07.160 --> 28:13.400]  creating mutants all the literature says it's the vaccinated they are going against mainline science
[28:13.400 --> 28:19.240]  because this is a war we're under a bio attack and the enemies on tv like tokyo rose or bagdad bob
[28:20.680 --> 28:26.360]  telling us everything's fine telling us they're taking care of us when they're lying to us because
[28:26.360 --> 28:36.200]  they're an enemy force you understand this all i can say is boost your immune system watch out
[28:36.200 --> 28:40.600]  but what's going to get us is to collapse the economy because now it's just people get sick
[28:40.600 --> 28:45.320]  then they get sick again and they get sick again because they've got a cocktail of viruses they're
[28:45.320 --> 28:51.480]  hitting us with god help us and god did give us the vitamins and minerals and nutrients that we
[28:51.480 --> 28:53.240]  need we all got to boost them right now
[28:57.240 --> 29:02.680]  hey everybody confused about staying healthy in a crazy covid culture me too but listen
[29:02.680 --> 29:07.240]  after all the research all the conflicting studies after all the squabbling there's one thing
[29:07.240 --> 29:12.760]  almost everyone agrees on it's that immune system health can literally be the difference between life
[29:12.760 --> 29:17.880]  and death you probably already believe that i certainly do so here's the thing i wanted to get
[29:17.880 --> 29:23.800]  past the craziness and find out which plant based substances actually have studies that demonstrate
[29:23.800 --> 29:29.000]  some efficacy in immune support now you'll have to sign a waiver but you can check out what i've

[31:58.520 --> 32:04.040]  let's go back in time say to the mid 1990s and then imagine a science fiction movie set in the
[32:04.040 --> 32:09.400]  year 2020 where a world government's being established where members of congress and former
[32:09.400 --> 32:15.080]  presidents are centered by big tech and where if you don't take an experimental injection that grows
[32:15.080 --> 32:22.360]  blood clots and and prions all over your body then you're not allowed to fly on an airplane think
[32:22.360 --> 32:28.200]  about that because that's where we are imagine just 20 30 years ago tell just five years ago if
[32:28.200 --> 32:34.760]  somebody told you this would be happening but it is happening now and then they tell you oh sorry
[32:34.760 --> 32:39.800]  it's not a vaccine it's a gene therapy and it doesn't really work she got to take it every few months
[32:39.800 --> 32:44.600]  and the people that have submitted say great i want to take it all the time so i can go outside
[32:44.600 --> 32:48.920]  and not get sick from covid even though it gets you sick from covid and now there's record numbers
[32:48.920 --> 32:53.720]  of really sick people from the sloughing the shedding of the virus and that's in mainline
[32:53.720 --> 32:57.720]  studies bill gates and fouts he did this need to go to prison for it right now
[32:57.720 --> 33:03.800]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[33:17.560 --> 33:24.920]  as everyone can see we're not in normal times a new world order a new global system
[33:24.920 --> 33:31.960]  based on carbon taxes based on depopulation based on pedophilia based on satanism is being
[33:31.960 --> 33:38.440]  established as we speak megacorporations believe there's too many people they believe they own
[33:38.440 --> 33:42.520]  and control the world they believe they're doing an emergency action to protect the planet that's
[33:42.520 --> 33:46.840]  what they say to their mid-level minions in truth they don't even care about the planet they believe
[33:46.840 --> 33:50.440]  they're going to be ai gods they're going to merge the machines they'll be able to create all the
[33:50.440 --> 33:57.640]  planets they want and they're in a rapid move to try to become a new species if you actually
[33:57.640 --> 34:03.000]  study their writings and again i've been talking about this almost 30 years elon musk is now quote
[34:03.000 --> 34:08.520]  warned of the globalist believing their ai gods he said that four years ago but then two years ago
[34:08.520 --> 34:16.440]  said actually he's all for it now so that's where we are but let me just explain something they didn't
[34:16.440 --> 34:21.400]  steal the election and put their puppet biden in because they were just going to let us take
[34:21.400 --> 34:29.560]  things back at the midterms that are now only 14 15 months out they're going for broke they're going
[34:29.560 --> 34:36.120]  to take taiwan they're going to take hong kong they're going to have afghanistan handed over to them
[34:36.680 --> 34:41.560]  on some of the chinese who were the tip of the spear for the globalist and and they intend to
[34:41.560 --> 34:47.560]  finally break the will of america and the way to do it is to destroy the immune system and poison
[34:47.560 --> 34:53.160]  the people and break down the society so much the social safety net breaks down and the civilization
[34:53.160 --> 34:59.320]  collapses that's how the communist the democratic party on record just via one plan clowered and
[34:59.320 --> 35:07.480]  piven look it up said they would do it and then you see them not forgiving rents at big mega
[35:07.480 --> 35:13.320]  high rises in places but ordering small businesses and people that only have a property or two
[35:14.200 --> 35:18.760]  for years now to give out free rent while they go bankrupt and then are forced to sell
[35:20.360 --> 35:24.360]  clowered and piven a political strategy to overload the american public welfare system
[35:24.360 --> 35:29.960]  the point of creates a crisis and bankrupts the nation leaving the country no choice but to adopt
[35:29.960 --> 35:36.360]  a socialist communist agenda the universal social credit score all of it while the big mega rich
[35:36.360 --> 35:42.360]  are the ones that will then finance and control that out of fiat so here it is the big money
[35:42.360 --> 35:47.640]  wants all the real assets it's not enough they've got thousands of trillions of fake dollars they
[35:47.640 --> 35:53.640]  created they need to implode the regular economy to force people out of real property to consolidate
[35:53.640 --> 35:59.960]  it so let's go over before i drop the major bomb show this is out of israel exact same numbers come
[35:59.960 --> 36:07.000]  out of new mexico same numbers come out of hawaii same numbers come out of jubbaltar or singapore
[36:07.720 --> 36:12.200]  singapore's now paying out multi hundred thousand dollar payments to folks that are dead and dying
[36:12.200 --> 36:21.320]  from the shots unvaccinated rates of new covid cases and you look at people that have taken two
[36:21.320 --> 36:30.760]  doses it's almost exactly the same line and track as vaccinated unvaccinated and why is that because
[36:30.760 --> 36:39.640]  it's entirely new viruses i'm gonna show you that in a moment here is the new israeli prime minister
[36:40.200 --> 36:45.720]  he says we're doomed people who received two vaccine shots want to walk around feeling like
[36:45.720 --> 36:51.640]  they're protected they don't understand that it's the second vaccine has faded against the delta
[36:51.640 --> 36:56.760]  they must quickly get vaccinated with the third dose but gates said a year and a half ago you'll
[36:56.760 --> 37:02.440]  get a third dose to start a giggling all the evidence says that's the one that really releases
[37:02.440 --> 37:07.800]  the super strain they got a lower your immune system with the first two shots down to one sixth
[37:07.800 --> 37:12.600]  of what it was then they give you this new one and it takes your body completely over and releases
[37:12.600 --> 37:18.680]  the real weapon that's what all the scientists are telling me here's another report this is out of
[37:18.680 --> 37:24.600]  four countries from the unzone numbers they show tv viewers this i'll read it for radio listeners
[37:24.600 --> 37:30.840]  palestine all the vaccines all the rest of it look they're very low level vaccine they don't
[37:30.840 --> 37:37.640]  trust the vaccines almost no cases no illnesses same thing on india less than 10 percent of the
[37:37.640 --> 37:48.360]  public vaccinated almost no cases now same thing here out of columbia they don't trust the system
[37:49.800 --> 37:55.720]  now a year later almost no one's sick they don't take the shots romania even more
[37:57.160 --> 38:04.200]  evident you see that but there's so much illness in the surrounding countries from the vaccines
[38:04.200 --> 38:08.680]  it's starting to leach in do you see it going up a little bit this is the same everywhere
[38:08.680 --> 38:13.400]  but see the young turks when they call me a murderer we'll play that next segment they don't
[38:13.400 --> 38:18.680]  they don't tell them they just get upset and say murder he's killing people silence him well how
[38:18.680 --> 38:22.920]  many people need to die alex i don't know how many people need to die tell me young turds
[38:24.360 --> 38:28.200]  your organization is named after a genocidal group that killed a million and a half christians
[38:28.200 --> 38:37.960]  hunting them now in the young turks look at this 52 percent of southern nevada covid 19 deaths
[38:37.960 --> 38:47.800]  were fully vaccinated let's have the cdc zone numbers swine flu program halted in nine states
[38:47.800 --> 38:52.760]  after three die after shots that was back in the 70s you see 76 because the new york times
[38:52.760 --> 38:58.840]  oh but we have over 20 000 deaths of the veirs and we're told it's okay
[39:00.920 --> 39:05.960]  and today the fda announced they approved a drug whose phase three clinical trials are not expected
[39:05.960 --> 39:11.320]  to be completed for two years if there ever were evidence to believe that the fda is a captured
[39:11.320 --> 39:15.640]  agency simply doing the bidding of trillion dollar industry it's supposed to be regulating
[39:15.640 --> 39:22.920]  this is it and next up covid 19 vaccines for children under 12 we know they're not even getting
[39:22.920 --> 39:27.320]  sick from it a true crime against humanity but they will get sick once it lowers their immunity
[39:27.320 --> 39:31.000]  the other stuff they've released see it's a binary weapon they're going to lower your immunity
[39:31.000 --> 39:36.680]  than hit you gel to impose two hundred dollar monthly fines on vaccinated employees how about
[39:36.680 --> 39:47.320]  violation of nirnberg code fda approves vaccines but won't release studies till 2025 and it goes on
[39:47.320 --> 39:53.960]  and on and on protection against covid infection number two vaccines falls within six months says
[39:53.960 --> 39:58.440]  fizer oh they're now telling us what they already had planned a year and a half ago and told us about
[39:58.440 --> 40:05.480]  and here's the big one i mentioned here's the big story that nobody else has because i showed you
[40:05.480 --> 40:12.840]  that graph in israel it's the same in hawaii same everywhere the vaccinated track with the
[40:12.840 --> 40:19.000]  unvaccinated getting sick and dying and in most places it's actually higher but then what was
[40:19.000 --> 40:25.320]  discovered by kellen mcgreen on info wars dot com which we don't like we don't want to be discovering
[40:25.320 --> 40:30.120]  things we want to be reporting on others discovering them so much half the time we discover stuff
[40:30.120 --> 40:38.120]  that's not good these we need to be superseded we need to be made obsolete we're under major attack
[40:38.120 --> 40:43.720]  because we are the vanguard we're the flagship that's not good tuckers becoming the flagship
[40:43.720 --> 40:49.400]  that's good we need other flagships this needs to get out don't give us credit all you blogs and
[40:49.400 --> 40:56.200]  stuff we don't want the credit just get this out trust the science cdc counts people dying within
[40:56.200 --> 41:04.680]  14 days of jab as unvaccinated so they're taking out people that die within 14 days even a lot of
[41:04.680 --> 41:09.960]  do and taking that out of the number and adding it to vaccinated so if you did that what would this
[41:09.960 --> 41:16.760]  graph be well we know what it would be it would be the vaccinated way higher not just tracking
[41:16.760 --> 41:22.040]  with the vaccinated because they're taking that two week out clearly that makes the graph change
[41:22.040 --> 41:29.640]  see how that works it's got all the statistics right there info wars dot com we've got the same
[41:29.640 --> 41:35.640]  lying surgeon general that says natural immunity is no good that's like saying platinum's no good
[41:36.360 --> 41:42.840]  sunlight's no good mama's milk's no good he's out saying oh yes vaccine passports and businesses
[41:42.840 --> 41:47.720]  and schools would be reasonable how about putting you on a rocket to the moon and you never come back
[41:47.720 --> 41:54.680]  to be reasonable new york city mayor de Blasio defends vaccine mandates human beings do well when
[41:54.680 --> 41:58.920]  they have a carrot in a stick yeah well you don't fear the people you don't have any stick
[41:58.920 --> 42:05.240]  that's the problem you're out of control some good news those spain supreme court rules against
[42:05.240 --> 42:12.440]  using vaccine passports restrict access to public spaces israel to grant green passes only to triple
[42:12.440 --> 42:21.320]  vaccinated uva banishes over 200 students we're feeling to get the covid shots and it just goes on
[42:23.720 --> 42:31.800]  from there but when we come back i'll give you the big news and then we have a huge guest i'm
[42:31.800 --> 42:39.160]  very excited about her coming on dr lee merit one of the most hardcore smartest people out there
[42:39.160 --> 42:44.440]  there or a military doctor as well going to be covering the waterfront with us in the next hour
[42:45.000 --> 42:50.280]  but i told you they're releasing new bio weapons we'll hit that on the other side i'm almost jones

[42:57.160 --> 43:02.840]  the purpose of fear is to call us into action and there is plenty to be afraid of today half
[43:02.840 --> 43:08.440]  the population has lined up for an untested deadly and debilitating experimental injection
[43:08.440 --> 43:14.040]  because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease the perpetrators of all this
[43:14.040 --> 43:19.080]  have clearly stated their goal of having 80 percent of the population hooked up to an artificial
[43:19.080 --> 43:24.920]  intelligence hive mind in less than nine years for those of us who have awoken from the spell
[43:24.920 --> 43:29.720]  we know this is all really happening and it's unbelievably unsettling to see but there is
[43:29.720 --> 43:35.720]  only two things to do we continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game if enough people
[43:35.720 --> 43:41.640]  awaken from the cold spell then we win but even when we win and we eventually will the days of
[43:41.640 --> 43:46.600]  convenience are soon coming to an end and so we must prepare get up to a years worth of

[44:00.040 --> 44:04.840]  over the globalist the treads the wheels the engine the scoop on the front it's all very
[44:04.840 --> 44:11.080]  important but the fuel is paramount and that's my allegory turbo force is vitamins minerals
[44:11.080 --> 44:16.120]  amino acids that synergistically work with six different natural forms of healthy clean energy
[44:16.120 --> 44:20.920]  that lasts for 10 hours in the average metabolic system metabolism of a human some people get 15
[44:20.920 --> 44:24.600]  hours of some people get about eight hours but people take this people taking sports people
[44:24.600 --> 44:29.880]  cannot believe it's the best they've ever had because it's not high nobody puts as much product
[44:29.880 --> 44:34.920]  into their pre workouts their post-workout you can call us whatever you want it's it's a it's a
[44:34.920 --> 44:40.680]  total solution all around the best you're gonna find turbo force without you we don't roll with you
[44:40.680 --> 44:44.760]  we search forward together it's like the bulldozer without the diesel fuel if we don't have your
[44:44.760 --> 44:48.680]  financial support we will be defeated you support us to get products you already need that literally

[45:03.640 --> 45:08.120]  have fillers and additives many of them just pass right through the body and are absorbed
[45:08.120 --> 45:13.400]  well that's not the case with our incredibly popular because it's so effective product that's
[45:13.400 --> 45:19.560]  now been sold out for months but it's finally back it's done and that is vitamin mineral fusion
[45:19.560 --> 45:24.840]  all the essential vitamins all the essential minerals a bunch of key amino acids help it upload
[45:24.840 --> 45:29.720]  better into your body in your cells it's a powder form straight for children it's great for adults
[45:29.720 --> 45:33.960]  it's really important for folks that are older because they don't absorb as well through their

[45:55.320 --> 46:02.520]  limited time 33 off info or store dot com let's go back in time say to the mid 1990s and then imagine
[46:02.520 --> 46:07.800]  a science fiction movie set in the year 2020 where a world government's being established where
[46:07.800 --> 46:13.080]  members of congress and former presidents are censored by big tech and where if you don't take
[46:13.080 --> 46:18.520]  an experimental injection that grows blood plots and and prions all over your body
[46:18.520 --> 46:24.600]  then you're not allowed to fly on an airplane think about that because that's where we are
[46:24.600 --> 46:30.600]  imagine just 20 30 years ago tell just five years ago if somebody told you this would be happening
[46:31.320 --> 46:36.520]  but it is happening now and then they tell you oh sorry it's not a vaccine it's a gene therapy
[46:36.520 --> 46:41.160]  and it doesn't really work so you got to take it every few months and the people that have submitted
[46:41.160 --> 46:46.200]  say great i want to take it all the time so i can go outside and not get sick from covid
[46:46.200 --> 46:50.360]  even though it gets you sick from covid and now there's record numbers of really sick people
[46:50.360 --> 46:55.320]  from the sloughing the shedding of the virus and that's in mainline studies bill gates and
[46:55.320 --> 47:17.240]  Fauci did this need to go to prison for it right now you're listening to the alex jones show crashing
[47:17.240 --> 47:31.000]  through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones all right ladies and gentlemen
[47:31.800 --> 47:39.560]  we were hit by a bio weapon last december december before last and we know peter dazzic
[47:39.560 --> 47:44.040]  was heading up the program for dr fouchie and mill gates ragged that they had taken five viruses
[47:44.040 --> 47:50.120]  and combined them and were developing a vaccine for it he said that in december of 2019 once
[47:50.120 --> 47:55.400]  they'd already released the virus he went out and did interviews as a cover story so later when it
[47:55.400 --> 48:00.920]  came out he'd say well i didn't do it on purpose i mean why would i be giving speeches about it
[48:00.920 --> 48:08.440]  but we now have the emails from fouchie to him in december months before this news came out saying
[48:08.440 --> 48:14.520]  prepare the vaccine prepare to roll out the covet 19 vaccine which had already tested and had ready
[48:14.520 --> 48:19.880]  on animals and by the way they knew it lowered the immunity of the animals and made them really
[48:19.880 --> 48:27.560]  sick and caused the antibody situation and i just played you multiple medical doctors
[48:28.680 --> 48:34.520]  and others saying all of that last segment so let's just look at some of all the crazy
[48:34.520 --> 48:39.640]  stuff we're being told popping up this is out of florida news out of the federal government's
[48:39.640 --> 48:46.280]  own website cdc us warns of polio like illness outbreak in four months
[48:48.680 --> 48:53.160]  and they don't say why they just say magically we're just you're gonna get paralyzed now it's like
[48:53.160 --> 48:59.560]  polio the national public health agency united states centers for disease control and prevention
[48:59.560 --> 49:05.240]  the same folks have brought you to ski experiment said on august 17th alerted of an expected
[49:05.240 --> 49:12.920]  outbreak of the polio like disease acute flaccid militis afm in the next four months
[49:13.480 --> 49:19.000]  it's a common but serious neurological condition it's caused the muscles and reflexes the body to
[49:19.000 --> 49:26.440]  become weak parents and doctors should suspect afm and patients with sudden limb weakness especially
[49:26.440 --> 49:32.360]  during august through november all the vaccines go back to school it said repeating a warning
[49:32.360 --> 49:37.080]  in the agency's latest vital signs report so when you get the shot and get sick oh it's just a new
[49:37.080 --> 49:43.400]  thing and but you know look for it even though they admit it's it's even ministers and major
[49:43.400 --> 49:48.680]  governments like australia and the uk have gotten really sick with stuff like this from the shots
[49:48.680 --> 49:55.880]  here's another one what's know about unusual rsv outbreak the biggest ever in the u.s making children
[49:55.880 --> 50:01.880]  and babies get sick and die of course the mass created it causes bacterial pneumonia so much more
[50:01.880 --> 50:10.040]  but no it's it's the cocktails of virus mutants being released being cooked up in the bodies of
[50:10.040 --> 50:15.720]  the people that have taken these franken shots texas children and children's hospitals are
[50:15.720 --> 50:25.080]  under siege from two viruses rsv and cova 19 and it goes it goes on and on from there so i've made
[50:25.080 --> 50:30.520]  a lot of phone calls i've talked to a lot of really smart people and i've seen the numbers of
[50:30.520 --> 50:38.520]  what they're isolating and there are all sorts of new viruses never before seen all over the place
[50:38.520 --> 50:45.880]  and that's from the 150 million plus people that took these mRNA shots and viral vector shots that
[50:45.880 --> 50:51.640]  just go in and order your body to create viruses that's what the spike proteins are and it just
[50:51.640 --> 50:58.200]  creates all new horrible forms of super toxic garbage that people then release they breathe they
[50:58.200 --> 51:03.880]  they defecate it into the sewage lines uh covid lives in the sewage that gets in the air and it's
[51:03.880 --> 51:10.360]  just everywhere and then you notice we have way more people dying way more people sick way more
[51:10.360 --> 51:15.880]  problems than we had a year ago but what did gates say on cobear a year and a half ago he said well
[51:15.880 --> 51:22.360]  really covid's just a drill soon terrorist will release a real bio weapon well he sees us humans
[51:22.360 --> 51:27.880]  as a terrorist they give us the shot we incubate it just like they did at wuhan testing cova 19
[51:27.880 --> 51:34.760]  pigs they would then create even more deadly variants and you ask why usually viruses get
[51:34.760 --> 51:41.160]  less deadly and more viral means they spread faster but are less deadly that's nature this is a five
[51:41.160 --> 51:46.760]  stage chimera they've already tested the mutations in animals that's why they wanted to skip animal
[51:46.760 --> 51:51.320]  testing publicly because they already did it for decades and knew it would show massive death
[51:52.520 --> 51:56.920]  that's why the experts that looked at it all these procedures scientists said you're going to have
[51:56.920 --> 51:59.800]  infertility you're going to have strokes heart attacks you're going to have
[52:00.840 --> 52:07.320]  all these antibody problems and now you see all of that has happened but that doesn't stop
[52:07.320 --> 52:13.480]  up george soros's minions that doesn't stop the hollywood scum that doesn't stop them from attacking
[52:13.480 --> 52:18.600]  us here's shan pin i've had dinner with shan pin i've talked to shan pin i know shan pin shan pin
[52:18.600 --> 52:24.440]  is literally mentally retarded when he played the guy in fast times at richmond high everyone
[52:24.440 --> 52:32.360]  sits there and says he's smart like a stone statue is i mean shan pin literally cannot tie a shoelaces
[52:32.360 --> 52:38.120]  shan pin would prefer it if unvaccinated people don't see his movies well you're a total failure
[52:38.120 --> 52:44.280]  shan don't worry we won't but let's go to some even bigger failures the young turds
[52:46.280 --> 52:52.200]  have been attacking me because you know i guess they love the armenian genocide or whatever and
[52:52.200 --> 52:56.680]  i'm against it but the young turds funded by george soros and hillary and the rest of them
[52:56.680 --> 53:03.640]  here they are ladies and gentlemen saying i want death and and i'm criticizing trump
[53:04.200 --> 53:09.080]  for saying the phyzer shots are effective and they work they don't i've got the head of phyzer
[53:09.080 --> 53:13.560]  saying it doesn't work you gotta take booster shots and those won't work either that's the facts
[53:14.120 --> 53:18.200]  and it lowers your immunity but they don't care because they can act all emotional here it is
[53:18.200 --> 53:27.480]  now alex jones is getting his loony people to not to think that trump is an idiot
[53:28.360 --> 53:33.800]  i mean yeah okay that's that part is is great but they think that's because trump's not crazy
[53:33.800 --> 53:38.920]  enough so they're gonna look for the next crazier person yeah how many i want to know how many
[53:38.920 --> 53:45.720]  americans need to die before alex jones is happy that's a real question it's not a sarcastic
[53:45.720 --> 53:51.240]  question it's not rhetorical like i just i'm genuinely curious so alex jones how many americans
[53:51.880 --> 53:58.200]  need to die because we're past six hundred twenty thousand from coronavirus i guess that's not
[53:58.200 --> 54:02.840]  enough for you how many of them do you want to see dead how many children do you want to see
[54:02.840 --> 54:08.520]  robbed of their parents because of your uh talking points and because of your disinformation
[54:08.520 --> 54:13.640]  campaigns how many would make alex jones happy i just want to know i just want to know because
[54:13.640 --> 54:21.640]  clearly he's gleeful at the thought of more americans needlessly dying from a virus that
[54:21.640 --> 54:25.400]  they don't need to die from if they just get vaccinated i'm curious can he please can he
[54:25.400 --> 54:32.760]  please tell me because shockingly donald trump who i am not a fan of had a brief moment of clarity
[54:32.760 --> 54:38.360]  there where he encouraged people to do the right thing not because trump actually even cares about
[54:38.360 --> 54:44.520]  anyone but because he realizes like hey i'm vaccinated all the elites in this country are
[54:44.520 --> 54:49.080]  vaccinated all the people who are discouraging you from getting vaccinated are vaccinated
[54:49.080 --> 54:53.800]  themselves as they live in their castles and they live their great lives so like maybe i should
[54:53.800 --> 54:57.240]  tell my supporters to get vaccinated i should encourage that no it's anna you're actually
[54:57.240 --> 55:02.040]  being too kind of trump the reason he's doing it is to brag about how he did operation warp speed
[55:02.040 --> 55:06.040]  and he deserves credit for the vaccine that's right it's all about trump it's always about trump
[55:06.040 --> 55:09.720]  that's all right that's enough and so he's trying and that part's true trump's pigheaded
[55:09.720 --> 55:14.360]  wants to take credit this is not a regular vaccine so that's the guy that said he wants to give
[55:14.360 --> 55:25.080]  animals pleasure he wants to pleasure i think it was horses he said so uh okay there you go um
[55:26.280 --> 55:29.560]  we have over 25 000 deaths in the various reporting system
[55:29.560 --> 55:38.200]  here's the new york times in 76 swine flu program is halted in nine states that were three die
[55:39.640 --> 55:45.160]  52 percent of southern nevada covid 19 deaths were fully vaccinated you see that
[55:46.760 --> 55:52.120]  and again here's the statistics out of israel basically the same number of deaths of those
[55:52.120 --> 55:56.920]  and hospitalizations that have had the vaccine and then we then discovered that they are not
[55:56.920 --> 56:01.240]  counting there or here people that have been vaccinated who died within two weeks so the
[56:01.240 --> 56:05.240]  number is actually higher of those vaccinated dying i mean these are numbers i'm not just
[56:05.240 --> 56:13.000]  using words like oh alex is loony tunes alex jones is loony tunes i've got all these countries
[56:13.000 --> 56:18.680]  that are like 10 vaccinated with much lower death rates and hospitalization rates that's the facts
[56:19.240 --> 56:24.760]  this is an experimental garbage it doesn't work we're gonna go to break i'm not funded by george
[56:24.760 --> 56:30.920]  soros i'm not funded by uh the democratic party i'm funded by you we got great products you need
[56:30.920 --> 56:34.760]  we got great stuff your immune system and your body and just stuff that's essential for general

[58:52.680 --> 58:57.960]  i was overweight i had brain fog like you wouldn't believe i was barely holding on to a job and i
[58:57.960 --> 59:02.440]  heard dr group on your show and i listened to it so the first one i got was the original survival
[59:02.440 --> 59:07.080]  shield the x1 and it worked pretty good and then shortly thereafter you came out with that too you
[59:07.080 --> 59:10.760]  had you know with a deep burden source you know and i got really excited about that so i took it
[59:10.760 --> 59:17.160]  and then in two weeks i went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened you
[59:17.160 --> 59:22.520]  know i could think again i could connect with people again and over the course of the next couple
[59:22.520 --> 59:27.160]  of years i got my health back and i religiously take basically all of your supplements they're

[1:06:36.760 --> 1:06:42.920]  here on the Alex Jones show began her medical career at the age of four carrying her father's
[1:06:42.920 --> 1:06:49.080]  black bag on house calls along the back roads of Iowa in the 1980 she graduated 1980 from the
[1:06:49.080 --> 1:06:54.360]  University of Rochester School of Medicine and dentistry in New York where she was elected
[1:06:54.360 --> 1:06:59.960]  the live membership of the Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Medical Society Dr. Merritt completed her
[1:06:59.960 --> 1:07:04.520]  osteopathic surgery residency in the United States Navy then served nine years the Navy
[1:07:04.520 --> 1:07:10.040]  physician and surgeon before returning to Rochester where she's the only woman to be appointed as the
[1:07:10.040 --> 1:07:14.920]  Louis A. Goldstein fellow of spinal surgery and i'm not going to go over the rest of the long
[1:07:14.920 --> 1:07:21.080]  bios we'll run through all our time but she has been really exposing SARS COVID-2 and more and
[1:07:21.080 --> 1:07:27.720]  gets the big picture that this is unconventional warfare of the medical rebel.com. Docs so much
[1:07:27.720 --> 1:07:32.920]  to cover i just i could ask questions all day but i want to go where you want to go first so
[1:07:32.920 --> 1:07:39.400]  great to have you here and please speak to our audience. Well thank you Alex it's really an
[1:07:39.400 --> 1:07:45.480]  honor to be on i mean i've watched you for years um i think the biggest thing to say today is the
[1:07:45.480 --> 1:07:52.200]  unbelievable tragedy of what they're doing to the military you know this isn't i've been i said
[1:07:52.920 --> 1:07:59.160]  in october if you don't vaccinate or in october last year i said if you don't vaccinate our troops
[1:07:59.160 --> 1:08:04.120]  i can guarantee you we'll have a standing army in three months but if you vaccinate people with an
[1:08:04.120 --> 1:08:09.800]  unknown you know untried experimental genetic therapy never used on humans didn't make it well
[1:08:09.800 --> 1:08:15.960]  through animal trials who knows what it's going to do well that's exactly what we're seeing and
[1:08:15.960 --> 1:08:21.560]  so today they're saying everybody must be vaccinated today now quite frankly that's not a
[1:08:21.560 --> 1:08:27.000]  readiness point that doesn't work that way if you've got if you've already got 60 vaccinated
[1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:31.640]  why does it have to be today there's something else at work here i just hope we're not on somebody
[1:08:31.640 --> 1:08:36.840]  else's invasion timeline that's what i'm hoping this sounds like a logistics timeline but but you
[1:08:36.840 --> 1:08:43.560]  know the real issue of national security isn't a small one here um the first thing to say is that
[1:08:44.280 --> 1:08:49.640]  china and and russia are not vaccinating their troops against using this type of technology
[1:08:49.640 --> 1:08:57.480]  by the way so we are in 2020 there were only 20 deaths of from covid and all the military
[1:08:57.480 --> 1:09:06.680]  services put together now we've already probably killed over 350 people from one side effect and
[1:09:06.680 --> 1:09:12.200]  that's myocarditis you know usually in the military every year there's about 800 cases and i think
[1:09:12.200 --> 1:09:18.280]  they're almost at 1400 this year when you take the the mortality the five-year mortality of that
[1:09:18.280 --> 1:09:24.200]  it's not good so the the risk benefit number one doesn't justify any of this you know and
[1:09:24.200 --> 1:09:30.600]  the second point to make which should be clear to everybody why this is not not about our nationals
[1:09:30.600 --> 1:09:35.080]  is not in the interest of our national security nor the the the valiant troops that we should
[1:09:35.080 --> 1:09:42.600]  be taking care of that we owe a debt to um you know the pilots we've had civilian pilots die
[1:09:42.600 --> 1:09:48.760]  and these civilian pilots are dying because of sitting in the cockpit for long periods of time
[1:09:48.760 --> 1:09:52.760]  immobile and we know just going on a long flight can do it to anybody you know when you sit for
[1:09:52.760 --> 1:09:56.840]  long periods of time you're at risk of blood clots and the legs that can go to your lungs and kill
[1:09:56.840 --> 1:10:02.440]  you so um that's always a risk but now after you take this vaccine this non-vaccine this
[1:10:02.440 --> 1:10:07.800]  experimental genetic agent you sit in those cockpits for long periods of time and we've had
[1:10:07.800 --> 1:10:14.600]  I think up to nine dot nine pilots civilian pilots die already um and and the airlines some of them
[1:10:14.600 --> 1:10:18.920]  have issued statements or something saying we don't think passengers should get on the plane
[1:10:18.920 --> 1:10:23.160]  right after they've had a vaccine because they're at risk so what are we doing in the military
[1:10:23.800 --> 1:10:28.120]  we are I think about 75 percent of military pilots are vaccinated and now they want the
[1:10:28.120 --> 1:10:33.080]  other 25 percent now keep in mind these are guys that don't sit in the cockpit where they can stand
[1:10:33.080 --> 1:10:38.120]  up and move around many of them uh many of them sit in single seat ejection seats or dual seat
[1:10:38.120 --> 1:10:42.040]  ejection seats for those that don't know they're I mean they're jammed in they're super tight
[1:10:42.040 --> 1:10:47.000]  especially if they're above average size and and they're not carrying passengers they're
[1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:51.160]  carrying armaments you know I mean they could be carrying passengers but but a lot of these guys
[1:10:51.160 --> 1:10:56.520]  they're the the combat pilots they're practicing with armaments including nuclear weapons what are
[1:10:56.520 --> 1:11:02.760]  we thinking and this violates every principle of military safety for pilots that we've ever seen
[1:11:02.760 --> 1:11:09.240]  you know I was never a flight surgeon but I spent 10 years as a navy surgeon um and I served on the
[1:11:09.240 --> 1:11:13.720]  navy research advisory committee after that as a civilian where we looked at defense strategy things
[1:11:13.720 --> 1:11:18.360]  and I'm going to tell you one of the things that you knew a lot of my friends were flight surgeons
[1:11:18.360 --> 1:11:23.240]  and I and I was stationed with the marine airwings everywhere I was when I wasn't in training and I
[1:11:23.240 --> 1:11:28.840]  will tell you one of the things I mean the the thing the military pilots hate to to see at any
[1:11:28.840 --> 1:11:33.960]  time are their flight surgeons because these guys are super healthy they're super screened
[1:11:33.960 --> 1:11:38.200]  and they're so afraid they're going to have a sniffle in front of the flight surgeon and be
[1:11:38.200 --> 1:11:43.960]  you know knocked off the flight schedule there is no indication for vaccinating these people with
[1:11:43.960 --> 1:11:48.280]  anything even if it were a good vaccine these people are too healthy they don't they're not at risk
[1:11:48.280 --> 1:11:53.240]  well doc I said I wouldn't interrupt you but you're you're so you're smart and you you mentioned
[1:11:53.240 --> 1:11:59.720]  it's like we're on an invasion timeline you pretty much set it all up front china is our enemy
[1:11:59.720 --> 1:12:03.960]  they're not taking this experimental injection india is not our enemy but they're less than 10
[1:12:03.960 --> 1:12:08.920]  percent inoculated they're not stupid they have really low rates and so it's really only the western
[1:12:08.920 --> 1:12:15.160]  world doing this and there's a desperate timeline australia under martial law until quote the public
[1:12:15.160 --> 1:12:20.520]  takes it and just uh desperate is just take it just take it then they admit it doesn't even work
[1:12:20.520 --> 1:12:25.000]  and now there's all these new weird viruses so flesh out what you were getting at there because
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:30.200]  clearly this is how you would soft kill america this is how you would shut us down where people
[1:12:30.200 --> 1:12:37.560]  are so sick we can't stand up when china takes taiwan you know I think that's not an outrageous
[1:12:37.560 --> 1:12:42.040]  statement at all I think that we we're less like say I think we're in a national security nightmare
[1:12:42.040 --> 1:12:49.720]  here because our standing army you know is being vaccinated and we've seen you know before they
[1:12:49.720 --> 1:12:54.280]  shut down all the communication out of australia there were some squeaking guys in the navy they
[1:12:54.280 --> 1:12:58.440]  vaccinated all the australian ships and there were some guys squeaking on to facebook to their
[1:12:58.440 --> 1:13:03.880]  relatives and friends saying that their readiness is down that they they've lost 25 percent of their
[1:13:03.880 --> 1:13:09.320]  crew to either illness or death and then they kind of shut it all up now I don't I can't verify that
[1:13:09.320 --> 1:13:15.720]  number but certainly there's a problem and there and and we know already just that just the myocarditis
[1:13:15.720 --> 1:13:21.080]  there's a problem with our our military readiness with this so a lot of genius to get
[1:13:22.120 --> 1:13:29.640]  china files like gates and Fauci to literally get us to take this that debilitates us we fall apart I
[1:13:29.640 --> 1:13:35.880]  mean it's a perfect plan to get your own enemy to take a bio weapon themselves well and that's
[1:13:35.880 --> 1:13:40.120]  what I keep telling people you know if you think you're you're fighting a virus then you're going
[1:13:40.120 --> 1:13:44.280]  to be a victim if you think you're fighting a war then you'll have a big picture here of what's
[1:13:44.280 --> 1:13:49.560]  going on we're in it you know and and and I find myself as kind of funny as a physician now instead
[1:13:49.560 --> 1:13:56.600]  of reading you know medical texts I'm reading this the colonel Zhao and Wang textbook on unrestricted
[1:13:56.600 --> 1:14:02.520]  warfare their book that they wrote in 1999 you know it outlines the point about unrestricted
[1:14:02.520 --> 1:14:07.080]  warfare you know we think of warfare as having a battlefield we can see the enemy we know how
[1:14:07.080 --> 1:14:11.640]  many troops we have we know what they have can get classical warfare that's the old wars all
[1:14:11.640 --> 1:14:17.000]  new wars are what we're seeing now this is the first modern war this is all that's that's exactly
[1:14:17.000 --> 1:14:23.560]  right old news so we know about this we actually have written uh texts on strategy of synthetic
[1:14:23.560 --> 1:14:28.920]  biology and that's the world we're in right now but beyond that it's a sci-op we're an economic war
[1:14:28.920 --> 1:14:33.880]  cyber war the multi dimensions are you know in your brain in your child's crib they're fighting
[1:14:33.880 --> 1:14:40.600]  this everywhere there is no set battlefield and trust me this the the the you know there there's
[1:14:40.600 --> 1:14:45.000]  an argument that there was never really a viral outbreak that there was a pathogen outbreak
[1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:50.840]  that that was spread you know then that's probably too long to go into the no no doc you've got the
[1:14:50.840 --> 1:14:55.800]  floor here like like we've got you for the next 40 minutes if you want to go longer this is exactly
[1:14:55.800 --> 1:15:00.120]  where i want to go because on other shows you're with other people and it's hurried come back and
[1:15:00.120 --> 1:15:04.040]  you've got all the time i'm gonna we're gonna go to break and you can cover it all we got 30
[1:15:04.040 --> 1:15:10.760]  seconds left keep going well i'll talk about that about was this ever an airborne viral outbreak
[1:15:10.760 --> 1:15:14.760]  and i will just say that i can't prove what i'm going to say but i'm going to say the numbers
[1:15:14.760 --> 1:15:19.800]  don't add up for a viral outbreak as much as they do is something that was a contact genetic
[1:15:19.800 --> 1:15:26.840]  pathogen and was spread well that's where my sources who are really smart folks are saying
[1:15:26.840 --> 1:15:32.760]  is that the pentagon knows that this was basically deployed uh and that it is a bio and it's not just
[1:15:32.760 --> 1:15:39.560]  one bio weapon it's a cocktail of bio weapons all right one of them being a vaccine absolutely we've
[1:15:39.560 --> 1:15:45.880]  got that lowers the immunity too all right doctors stay there dr lee merritt themedicalrebel.com she
[1:15:45.880 --> 1:15:52.120]  can flesh all this out the chinese wallpaper uh synthetic biological war all of it straight
[1:15:52.120 --> 1:16:04.440]  ahead tell folks tune in now your voice counts when you share information be it over the internet
[1:16:04.440 --> 1:16:10.040]  or in person it changes the world the globalists know their agenda is unpopular they know you're
[1:16:10.040 --> 1:16:15.640]  angry and now to get around big tech it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've

[1:17:13.720 --> 1:17:18.600]  you probably already believe that i certainly do so here's the thing i wanted to get past the
[1:17:18.600 --> 1:17:24.520]  craziness and find out which plant based substances actually have studies that demonstrate some

[1:19:05.960 --> 1:19:11.560]  challenge first of all let me say i love your products i am a granny and um for all the
[1:19:11.560 --> 1:19:16.600]  senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me i was loaded up with
[1:19:16.600 --> 1:19:22.520]  sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called but since taking your x2 for the last couple of
[1:19:22.520 --> 1:19:30.040]  years my skin is just really gorgeous actually people think i'm 55 years old and i was already
[1:19:30.040 --> 1:19:34.680]  taking your other supplements but i thought you know well maybe that's what i need to do because
[1:19:34.680 --> 1:19:39.240]  i just thought it was a hopeless situation but when i started taking it i mean it doesn't happen
[1:19:39.240 --> 1:19:45.560]  immediately but you know over a period of time i started noticing okay you know this is a ticket
[1:19:45.560 --> 1:19:51.560]  this is working this is wonderful you know i don't i don't have to put on derma blend anymore you
[1:19:51.560 --> 1:19:56.600]  know so anyway it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin
[1:19:56.600 --> 1:20:04.120]  and you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:20:04.120 --> 1:20:11.640]  though
[1:20:22.040 --> 1:20:26.680]  well dr lee merits our guests here on the alex jones show and she's normally rushed we've got some
[1:20:26.680 --> 1:20:30.360]  time with her so i want her to go wherever she wants and get into what she really thinks is
[1:20:30.360 --> 1:20:36.280]  going on here and what's coming next and why the medical rebel comes to medical doctor and a great
[1:20:36.280 --> 1:20:43.960]  lady okay so so please continue doc well i was just so here's what happened you know every year
[1:20:43.960 --> 1:20:48.040]  we have a winter death curve call it you know if it's a viral death curve we don't know but but
[1:20:48.040 --> 1:20:52.840]  in every winter we blame it on flu and pneumonia and all these things picking off old people and
[1:20:52.840 --> 1:20:58.040]  people at risk and it's just like a bell shaped curve but when this started and i have a friend
[1:20:58.040 --> 1:21:02.920]  that used to work at usamrod our bio weapons lab and they and i used to call him and say hey should
[1:21:02.920 --> 1:21:06.840]  i watch this one whenever like stars or mirrors came out he used to always say no until this one
[1:21:06.840 --> 1:21:12.680]  so he said watch this one so i did and quite frankly this looked really bad at first it didn't
[1:21:12.680 --> 1:21:17.560]  look like that curve it was going up hyperbolically and you had epidemiologists all over the world
[1:21:17.560 --> 1:21:21.320]  saying this is the worst thing we've ever seen this is the worst remember that are not value the
[1:21:21.320 --> 1:21:26.040]  worst are not value you know it really looked bad and if you'd projected that out we would have lost
[1:21:26.040 --> 1:21:31.160]  two million people by the middle of july what we didn't that isn't what happened right what happened
[1:21:31.160 --> 1:21:39.640]  was it just went right down into the normal curve we see every winter but then we saw
[1:21:40.200 --> 1:21:45.400]  then we started talking about cases okay suddenly we redefined cases from the time of apocrates we
[1:21:45.400 --> 1:21:51.080]  defined a case as a sick person but now it was a case based on a flawed pcr test which we will
[1:21:51.080 --> 1:21:57.480]  talk about but it started going up that got everybody afraid but the death curve kept going
[1:21:57.480 --> 1:22:04.120]  down and it kept going down just like it does every winter until the vaccination and now we
[1:22:04.120 --> 1:22:09.320]  have like you can see the difference between albania and Gibraltar albania and Gibraltar
[1:22:09.320 --> 1:22:14.360]  followed that death curve through the winter and then it kind of went down went down got to about
[1:22:14.360 --> 1:22:18.920]  zero albania continued at zero because they're not vaccinating Gibraltar is one of the highest
[1:22:18.920 --> 1:22:25.160]  vaccinated places in the world and the death curve has gone up along a pretty steep curve now so that's
[1:22:25.160 --> 1:22:31.720]  so that's the overall picture now here's here's what you have to ask yourself what started at all
[1:22:31.720 --> 1:22:41.960]  if we actually started looking at an airborne virus you know we have some experience with
[1:22:41.960 --> 1:22:48.200]  airborne viruses especially in our bio weapons understanding of smallpox now you know it's the
[1:22:48.200 --> 1:22:56.840]  most deadly airborne virus known to mankind at this point and they did a the the the idea that
[1:22:56.840 --> 1:23:04.440]  they this could take over a huge you know world cities if it ever broke out was was done in a war
[1:23:04.440 --> 1:23:09.480]  game called dark weather that you keep hearing being alert looted to but it was like 1996 I think
[1:23:09.480 --> 1:23:14.600]  and it showed that within they it was an army war game using smallpox and they said within two weeks
[1:23:14.600 --> 1:23:18.600]  or three weeks it'd be all over the world and within three months it could kill 60% of the
[1:23:18.600 --> 1:23:24.680]  population it's a highly I mean that's real contagion but this isn't that so what what if this
[1:23:24.680 --> 1:23:29.480]  was that we would have seen France we've said Paris this would have ripped through Paris it would
[1:23:29.480 --> 1:23:34.840]  have ripped through all on Nebraska would rip through Pittsburgh didn't do that okay it ripped
[1:23:34.840 --> 1:23:40.760]  through three cities Wuhan the Lombardi area and Italy and New York City and then it kind of fizzled
[1:23:40.760 --> 1:23:47.800]  out into this normal curve what do we call a virus we call it a little bit of genetic material RNA
[1:23:47.800 --> 1:23:53.160]  usually our DNA wrapped in a lipoprotein coat that gets into your mucus membranes like in your
[1:23:53.160 --> 1:24:00.360]  nose or your eyes and it makes you sick or kills you what would we call a contact genetic pathogen
[1:24:00.360 --> 1:24:07.880]  little bit of genetic material wrapped in a small protein coat synthetic genetic material wrapped in
[1:24:07.880 --> 1:24:12.600]  a synthetic lipoprotein coat that gets into your mucus membranes and can make you sick or kill you
[1:24:13.800 --> 1:24:20.760]  now in 2015 there was a paper that came out and it had to do with getting rid of mice population
[1:24:20.760 --> 1:24:28.600]  in Australia and it used what they called self-disseminating vaccines and if you look at how they
[1:24:28.600 --> 1:24:33.800]  were made they were made very similar to the Johnson and Johnson vaccine with a with a
[1:24:33.800 --> 1:24:39.880]  replicant deficient virus that was specific to the mice population and the way it worked is
[1:24:40.680 --> 1:24:45.560]  they had a mathematical formula that they worked out how many mice they had to vaccinate in order
[1:24:45.560 --> 1:24:51.160]  to kill off a certain percentage of the population and what they did is they gave the mice the injection
[1:24:51.160 --> 1:24:54.920]  or the the vaccine I don't remember how they administered it they gave them the injection
[1:24:54.920 --> 1:25:01.160]  it sterilized them by going to their ovaries and sterilizing the female mice then they went out
[1:25:01.160 --> 1:25:05.000]  they were they were released and they went out and they rubbed up against a whole bunch of other
[1:25:05.000 --> 1:25:11.400]  mice and they got the vaccine and then they became sterile and then they rubbed up against a whole
[1:25:11.400 --> 1:25:17.000]  group of mice and then the same thing happened and then it kind of petered out that's the that's
[1:25:17.000 --> 1:25:22.440]  the self-disseminating property of this vaccine now let's just say we have we're dealing with
[1:25:22.440 --> 1:25:28.840]  something like that you take a and and I can tell you there's lots of history of us being involved
[1:25:28.840 --> 1:25:36.120]  in potential studies about this you take this potential pathogen this this pathogen and you
[1:25:36.120 --> 1:25:41.240]  put it in a lipoprotein code that you can put out places and then you just spread it around the
[1:25:41.240 --> 1:25:47.480]  cities you want to go down and then you watch what happens and it and it and some people get really
[1:25:47.480 --> 1:25:52.040]  sick and die they spread it to other people it looks like it's infectious but it's really not
[1:25:52.040 --> 1:25:56.040]  and it's controllable in that it doesn't have to go everywhere it just has to take down enough
[1:25:56.040 --> 1:26:02.040]  cities to make us afraid and then you come out with the very same pathogen and you repackage it as a
[1:26:02.040 --> 1:26:09.480]  vaccine because let's look we figured out you know coronavirus has 30,000 base pairs they claim
[1:26:09.480 --> 1:26:14.280]  but the part that makes you sick has less than 300 base pairs it's the spike protein head of this
[1:26:14.280 --> 1:26:19.560]  virus on this virus. So you say they have like a viral spike protein chemical simulate that does
[1:26:19.560 --> 1:26:23.880]  the same thing you have all the studies and I know the UN is obsessed with vaccines that
[1:26:23.880 --> 1:26:30.680]  self-spread that depopulate and so here we are. Here we are and if you look at what Ralph Barrick
[1:26:30.680 --> 1:26:34.840]  all the people that I'm sure you've talked about I know you've talked about Ralph Barrick in North
[1:26:34.840 --> 1:26:40.760]  Carolina there was Dr. Shu with Dr. Frank Plummer who's dead now from Winnipeg. Now talk about and
[1:26:40.760 --> 1:26:46.920]  explain Obama and this program going on in North Carolina move to Wuhan I mean it's just crazy how
[1:26:46.920 --> 1:26:52.280]  they were all involved running this. Well yeah and I don't just point my fingers at the Chinese
[1:26:52.280 --> 1:26:58.120]  quite frankly this is a this is a supernatural. Oh I agree they're globalists they were all involved.
[1:26:59.320 --> 1:27:04.680]  They're part of the action arm here but we you know what well to understand that you got to
[1:27:04.680 --> 1:27:09.400]  understand Tony Fauci's the bag man that's what I call it he's the bag man everybody right now
[1:27:09.400 --> 1:27:12.920]  what you know you're watching him being thrown under the bus but he's really just the bag man
[1:27:12.920 --> 1:27:17.960]  meaning the mob term I think for when you take the big mob boss money you spread it out to the
[1:27:17.960 --> 1:27:22.120]  people to do these jobs and then you make sure they do the jobs or you break their legs
[1:27:22.120 --> 1:27:28.360]  okay so so Dr. Fauci and his career at the NIH and why we're listening to him about medical advice
[1:27:28.360 --> 1:27:34.120]  by the way I have no clue because as far as I know he went from medical training to being
[1:27:34.120 --> 1:27:38.360]  administrator and researcher at the NIH and has never done anything else we should be listening
[1:27:38.360 --> 1:27:42.360]  to people that are actually saving people's lives but that's another part of the story
[1:27:42.360 --> 1:27:47.480]  he's the bag man so he spreads out all this money and over his career at the NIH he's actually at
[1:27:47.480 --> 1:27:52.120]  about 800 billion dollars go across his desk I mean who in the government has that kind of
[1:27:52.120 --> 1:27:57.800]  allocation authority and what he did with that is he did a couple things one is he spread it to
[1:27:57.800 --> 1:28:03.960]  these hospitals and these university research places and it allowed them to over build so
[1:28:03.960 --> 1:28:09.160]  they're dependent on that money so now if they want to talk to you about hydroxychloroquine or
[1:28:09.160 --> 1:28:14.360]  ivermectin oh no no no no it's got to be remdesivir or we we jerk your funding for next year so
[1:28:14.360 --> 1:28:18.520]  that's a control mechanism but the other thing that has happened over a long time there's many
[1:28:18.520 --> 1:28:26.760]  decades that that money was put out to people that were essentially taking studying a natural
[1:28:26.760 --> 1:28:31.880]  genomes they love the the coronavirus genome and especially this back coronavirus because I guess
[1:28:31.880 --> 1:28:36.600]  it was very manipulable Dr. Lee Merritt stay there this is riveting back in just a few minutes
[1:28:36.600 --> 1:28:41.160]  couple long segments coming up wow you can just look see for days this is so true because I've
[1:28:41.160 --> 1:28:45.160]  researched it all I know what you're saying Zachary plush you've got even more knowledge so
[1:28:45.160 --> 1:28:49.880]  everybody tune in now I also want to go through the evidence to talk about how do we stop it what
[1:28:49.880 --> 1:28:55.400]  do we do how does she think we counter this straight ahead themedicalrebel.com find all her
[1:28:55.400 --> 1:29:00.120]  great work there she's a great lady so many people say to me Alex please stop being so negative
[1:29:01.080 --> 1:29:07.560]  well for me admitting I've gotten a rotten tooth and going in a root canal is not negative it hurts
[1:29:07.560 --> 1:29:12.360]  it stinks it's got pus coming out of it I go to the doctor they fix it that's not negative
[1:29:12.360 --> 1:29:18.840]  I'm not living in denial and so think of globalism as being hidden as an infection that we feel yet
[1:29:18.840 --> 1:29:23.960]  but now it's come to the surface that's actually a positive thing and so yeah Trump did an overall
[1:29:23.960 --> 1:29:30.760]  great job they stole the election we can't get down about that we have forced them out in the open
[1:29:31.640 --> 1:29:35.880]  so now they're trying to suppress us because they know they've been exposed they're scared
[1:29:35.880 --> 1:29:40.520]  that's why instead of saying oh we're a bunch of losers look what happened no we're a bunch of winners
[1:29:40.520 --> 1:29:45.880]  they're trying to suppress us let our light of truth shine and tell everybody what's happening
[1:29:45.880 --> 1:29:51.320]  your own website your own show my show other articles other videos just keep sharing however
[1:29:51.320 --> 1:29:55.560]  you can and realize we're in an information war we're going to win this together and the fight
[1:29:55.560 --> 1:30:02.360]  starts temple wars.com so when I first started taking survival skills basically I was 275 pounds
[1:30:02.360 --> 1:30:07.640]  I was overweight I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe I was barely holding on to a job and I
[1:30:07.640 --> 1:30:12.120]  heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it so the first one I got was the original survival
[1:30:12.120 --> 1:30:16.760]  shield the X1 and it worked pretty good and then shortly thereafter you came out with that too you
[1:30:16.760 --> 1:30:20.440]  had you know with a deep burden source you know and I got really excited about that so I took it
[1:30:20.440 --> 1:30:27.080]  and man in two weeks I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened you know
[1:30:27.080 --> 1:30:32.440]  I could think again I could connect with people again and over the course of the next couple of
[1:30:32.440 --> 1:30:37.240]  years I got my health back and I religiously take basically all of your supplements they're all
[1:30:37.240 --> 1:30:41.960]  absolutely amazing supplements the one I like recently is knockout literally like if you want
[1:30:41.960 --> 1:30:46.440]  to sleep just take it it's amazing it works but anyway so the point is we have to get ourselves
[1:30:46.440 --> 1:30:50.920]  clean we have to break free of the globalist system and the only way to do that is to take
[1:30:50.920 --> 1:30:55.560]  our own health into our own hands. Beautifully said brother I thank you so much for your call and
[1:30:55.560 --> 1:31:03.160]  Godspeed. I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021 and I just want to say something
[1:31:03.160 --> 1:31:07.720]  I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together over the
[1:31:07.720 --> 1:31:12.520]  years it is truly an answer to prayer and I am so blessed and thankful for all of you the listeners

[1:32:50.600 --> 1:32:54.480]  A true 360 win survival mineral fusion sold out for months
[1:32:54.480 --> 1:32:56.160]  is back in stock for a limited time,

[1:33:01.120 --> 1:33:04.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:04.160 --> 1:33:14.160]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide.
[1:33:14.160 --> 1:33:16.160]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:33:16.160 --> 1:33:19.160]  So Dr. Lee Merritt's an amazing medical doctor,
[1:33:19.160 --> 1:33:21.160]  author, researcher, she's with us now.
[1:33:21.160 --> 1:33:23.160]  He understands she's being very moral here.
[1:33:23.160 --> 1:33:25.160]  She's reverting her own life,
[1:33:25.160 --> 1:33:27.160]  she's been a part of the world,
[1:33:27.160 --> 1:33:29.160]  she's been a part of the world,
[1:33:29.160 --> 1:33:31.160]  she's a part of the world,
[1:33:31.160 --> 1:33:33.160]  she's a part of the world,
[1:33:33.160 --> 1:33:35.160]  she's being very moral here.
[1:33:35.160 --> 1:33:37.160]  She's reverse engineering in all herself,
[1:33:37.160 --> 1:33:39.160]  going over evidence.
[1:33:39.160 --> 1:33:41.160]  But you can go to John Hopkins,
[1:33:41.160 --> 1:33:44.160]  you can go to the Rockefeller Foundation,
[1:33:44.160 --> 1:33:47.160]  you can go to all these places
[1:33:47.160 --> 1:33:49.160]  and have them talk about bringing in an authoritarian
[1:33:49.160 --> 1:33:52.160]  world government using a virus and the fear of a virus
[1:33:52.160 --> 1:33:54.160]  and ending free societies
[1:33:54.160 --> 1:33:57.160]  and bringing in technocracies
[1:33:57.160 --> 1:33:59.160]  that use computers to control you
[1:33:59.160 --> 1:34:01.160]  in the name of stopping viruses.
[1:34:01.160 --> 1:34:06.160]  There is a report out of all places.
[1:34:06.160 --> 1:34:09.160]  John Hopkins, technologies to address global
[1:34:09.160 --> 1:34:12.160]  catastrophic biological risk.
[1:34:12.160 --> 1:34:17.160]  And it talks about self-spreading vaccines,
[1:34:17.160 --> 1:34:20.160]  self-amplifying mRNA vaccines.
[1:34:20.160 --> 1:34:22.160]  And of course then Germany passed a law
[1:34:22.160 --> 1:34:24.160]  letting these things be shatters.
[1:34:24.160 --> 1:34:26.160]  I mean they admit that's what's going on.
[1:34:26.160 --> 1:34:28.160]  And we have Fauci, let's play a clip of Fauci
[1:34:28.160 --> 1:34:31.160]  talking about antibody dependent enhancement
[1:34:31.160 --> 1:34:33.160]  in March of last year,
[1:34:33.160 --> 1:34:38.160]  but then when Dr. Merritt or Dr. Hedon
[1:34:38.160 --> 1:34:40.160]  or Dr. whoever brings it up,
[1:34:40.160 --> 1:34:43.160]  oh then they're cooks and bad, but here's Fauci.
[1:34:43.160 --> 1:34:44.160]  The issue of safety,
[1:34:44.160 --> 1:34:46.160]  something that I want to make sure
[1:34:46.160 --> 1:34:48.160]  the American public understand.
[1:34:48.160 --> 1:34:51.160]  It's not only safety when you inject somebody
[1:34:51.160 --> 1:34:54.160]  and they get maybe an idiosyncratic reaction,
[1:34:54.160 --> 1:34:56.160]  they get a little allergic reaction,
[1:34:56.160 --> 1:34:58.160]  they get a little pain.
[1:34:58.160 --> 1:35:00.160]  They're safety associated.
[1:35:00.160 --> 1:35:02.160]  Does the vaccine make you worse?
[1:35:02.160 --> 1:35:05.160]  And there are diseases in which you vaccinate someone.
[1:35:05.160 --> 1:35:08.160]  They get infected with what you're trying to protect them with
[1:35:08.160 --> 1:35:11.160]  and you actually enhance the infection.
[1:35:11.160 --> 1:35:14.160]  You can get a good feel for that in animal models.
[1:35:14.160 --> 1:35:16.160]  So that's going to be interspersed
[1:35:16.160 --> 1:35:18.160]  at the same time that we're testing.
[1:35:18.160 --> 1:35:20.160]  We're going to try and make sure
[1:35:20.160 --> 1:35:22.160]  we don't have enhancement.
[1:35:22.160 --> 1:35:24.160]  It's the worst possible thing you could do
[1:35:24.160 --> 1:35:26.160]  to prevent infection and actually
[1:35:26.160 --> 1:35:28.160]  Does it already done under other names?
[1:35:28.160 --> 1:35:30.160]  And of course, here's the CEO,
[1:35:30.160 --> 1:35:32.160]  this is a real interview, it's on Joe,
[1:35:32.160 --> 1:35:34.160]  of Pfizer saying he doesn't need the vaccine.
[1:35:34.160 --> 1:35:36.160]  Here it is.
[1:35:36.160 --> 1:35:38.160]  59 years old in good health.
[1:35:38.160 --> 1:35:40.160]  I'm not working in the front line.
[1:35:40.160 --> 1:35:44.160]  So my type is not recommended
[1:35:44.160 --> 1:35:46.160]  to get vaccinated.
[1:35:46.160 --> 1:35:48.160]  Dr. Lee Merritt, so clearly
[1:35:48.160 --> 1:35:50.160]  this is the way the globalists take over.
[1:35:50.160 --> 1:35:52.160]  They admit it, it's out the open.
[1:35:52.160 --> 1:35:54.160]  We're going to get into the nuts and bolts
[1:35:54.160 --> 1:35:56.160]  of this go wherever you want to go now.
[1:35:56.160 --> 1:35:58.160]  But also, later, just give us the big picture
[1:35:58.160 --> 1:36:00.160]  and how you think we can defeat it. Please continue.
[1:36:00.160 --> 1:36:02.160]  Well, I was just, I had talked about Fauci
[1:36:02.160 --> 1:36:04.160]  being the guy that distributed the money
[1:36:04.160 --> 1:36:06.160]  and that's important later, but then
[1:36:06.160 --> 1:36:08.160]  it went to all these labs around the world.
[1:36:08.160 --> 1:36:10.160]  You know, there's a Dr. Shee
[1:36:10.160 --> 1:36:12.160]  and Wuhan that was collaborating
[1:36:12.160 --> 1:36:14.160]  and Frank Plummer, Dr. Shee
[1:36:14.160 --> 1:36:16.160]  and her husband up in Winnipeg
[1:36:16.160 --> 1:36:18.160]  and it reads, when you know all the details
[1:36:18.160 --> 1:36:20.160]  I'm going to go ahead and show
[1:36:20.160 --> 1:36:22.160]  I mean, just one
[1:36:22.160 --> 1:36:24.160]  fact here is that Dr. Plummer
[1:36:24.160 --> 1:36:26.160]  brought some stuff back that looked
[1:36:26.160 --> 1:36:28.160]  like MERS, but it was some lung stuff
[1:36:28.160 --> 1:36:30.160]  from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.
[1:36:30.160 --> 1:36:32.160]  And he has this PLA
[1:36:32.160 --> 1:36:34.160]  neurologist working in his lab,
[1:36:34.160 --> 1:36:36.160]  Dr. Shee, and
[1:36:36.160 --> 1:36:38.160]  at some point, some of this stuff gets back to China
[1:36:38.160 --> 1:36:40.160]  and people start complaining about it
[1:36:40.160 --> 1:36:42.160]  and the only thing that really happens
[1:36:42.160 --> 1:36:44.160]  there wasn't a great big investigation
[1:36:44.160 --> 1:36:46.160]  but what happened is that
[1:36:46.160 --> 1:36:48.160]  the Royal Canadian Mounted Police came in
[1:36:48.160 --> 1:36:50.160]  escorted her and her husband out
[1:36:50.160 --> 1:36:52.160]  and they went back behind
[1:36:52.160 --> 1:36:54.160]  the bamboo curtain just before all this happened.
[1:36:54.160 --> 1:36:56.160]  Dr. Plummer
[1:36:56.160 --> 1:36:58.160]  on February 4th goes down
[1:36:58.160 --> 1:37:00.160]  to give a lecture in
[1:37:00.160 --> 1:37:02.160]  Africa and just
[1:37:02.160 --> 1:37:04.160]  he's my agent, he's in good health, but he drops it
[1:37:04.160 --> 1:37:06.160]  out of a heart attack. So there's a lot of that
[1:37:06.160 --> 1:37:08.160]  going around that looks a lot like cutting
[1:37:08.160 --> 1:37:10.160]  your tail, you know, cutting your ties
[1:37:10.160 --> 1:37:12.160]  but at any rate, a lot of this
[1:37:12.160 --> 1:37:14.160]  money went out. So now this, now
[1:37:14.160 --> 1:37:16.160]  you know, the very, two things happened
[1:37:16.160 --> 1:37:18.160]  on October 19th, 2019.
[1:37:18.160 --> 1:37:20.160]  One is we had
[1:37:20.160 --> 1:37:22.160]  Event 201, which I think all your listeners know about
[1:37:22.160 --> 1:37:24.160]  where they did a war game
[1:37:24.160 --> 1:37:26.160]  with a pandemic with something
[1:37:26.160 --> 1:37:28.160]  they came up with, oh, I know, let's just come up with a
[1:37:28.160 --> 1:37:30.160]  novel coronavirus as the pathogen
[1:37:30.160 --> 1:37:32.160]  they did that. But the other thing
[1:37:32.160 --> 1:37:34.160]  that people don't talk about was that on
[1:37:34.160 --> 1:37:36.160]  October 19th, the international
[1:37:36.160 --> 1:37:38.160]  world military game started
[1:37:38.160 --> 1:37:40.160]  in Wuhan, China.
[1:37:40.160 --> 1:37:42.160]  And so the Chinese claimed, by the way
[1:37:42.160 --> 1:37:44.160]  after this, that the disease came over
[1:37:44.160 --> 1:37:46.160]  with their athletes and they did have
[1:37:46.160 --> 1:37:48.160]  some evidence about this. What I can tell you
[1:37:48.160 --> 1:37:50.160]  is there is no evidence that came from
[1:37:50.160 --> 1:37:52.160]  the food market. And there's
[1:37:52.160 --> 1:37:54.160]  actually, it's interesting that
[1:37:54.160 --> 1:37:56.160]  you cannot,
[1:37:56.160 --> 1:37:58.160]  what they claim is this virus cannot
[1:37:58.160 --> 1:38:00.160]  be, cannot reinfect bats.
[1:38:00.160 --> 1:38:02.160]  So this is,
[1:38:02.160 --> 1:38:04.160]  it goes along with what we now
[1:38:04.160 --> 1:38:06.160]  believe is that this is a lab created
[1:38:06.160 --> 1:38:08.160]  pathogen. Not that it didn't come from
[1:38:08.160 --> 1:38:10.160]  bat DNA, but it's RNA, but it's
[1:38:10.160 --> 1:38:12.160]  sure they took it, took it so far
[1:38:12.160 --> 1:38:14.160]  away that it then couldn't reinfect bats.
[1:38:14.160 --> 1:38:16.160]  And exactly, not that we defend the
[1:38:16.160 --> 1:38:18.160]  chikoms, but clearly the globalists
[1:38:18.160 --> 1:38:20.160]  put the chikoms in power. They were
[1:38:20.160 --> 1:38:22.160]  trying to use this and move it to China
[1:38:22.160 --> 1:38:24.160]  to have plausible deniability when they
[1:38:24.160 --> 1:38:26.160]  released it on America, their real target.
[1:38:26.160 --> 1:38:28.160]  Now, here's what I tell
[1:38:28.160 --> 1:38:30.160]  people about worldview. This is
[1:38:30.160 --> 1:38:32.160]  what happened after the whole thing
[1:38:32.160 --> 1:38:34.160]  broke out and
[1:38:34.160 --> 1:38:36.160]  you know, the question is how
[1:38:36.160 --> 1:38:38.160]  we deal with it. Well,
[1:38:38.160 --> 1:38:40.160]  you know, you heard everybody knows now about Carrie
[1:38:40.160 --> 1:38:42.160]  was saying that this is not the right
[1:38:42.160 --> 1:38:44.160]  test. You don't use PCR tests for diagnosis.
[1:38:44.160 --> 1:38:46.160]  He also, by the way, called
[1:38:46.160 --> 1:38:48.160]  faucin, and then he was dead. I'm not
[1:38:48.160 --> 1:38:50.160]  suicidal, by the way. But in any
[1:38:50.160 --> 1:38:52.160]  way, what happened is they started using
[1:38:52.160 --> 1:38:54.160]  these PCR tests and you okay, we'll agree
[1:38:54.160 --> 1:38:56.160]  it's not the right test. But
[1:38:56.160 --> 1:38:58.160]  how they use them is very
[1:38:58.160 --> 1:39:00.160]  enlightening as to what we think
[1:39:00.160 --> 1:39:02.160]  about the worldview that happened in 2020.
[1:39:02.160 --> 1:39:04.160]  Because
[1:39:04.160 --> 1:39:06.160]  lab managers are
[1:39:06.160 --> 1:39:08.160]  trained professionals. They really
[1:39:08.160 --> 1:39:10.160]  understand
[1:39:10.160 --> 1:39:12.160]  how to set up tests. They know
[1:39:12.160 --> 1:39:14.160]  how to train their staff. They know how to read the brochures.
[1:39:14.160 --> 1:39:16.160]  If they had a test that was routinely
[1:39:16.160 --> 1:39:18.160]  90 minutes off, or 90
[1:39:18.160 --> 1:39:20.160]  percent false positives,
[1:39:20.160 --> 1:39:22.160]  they would, they'd be
[1:39:22.160 --> 1:39:24.160]  fired from a hospital lab, right?
[1:39:24.160 --> 1:39:26.160]  So what happened in 2020?
[1:39:26.160 --> 1:39:28.160]  Every lab of any size took these
[1:39:28.160 --> 1:39:30.160]  tests in with the brochure, and I read the
[1:39:30.160 --> 1:39:32.160]  thermal official brochure that says you
[1:39:32.160 --> 1:39:34.160]  cycle it 20 to 30 times,
[1:39:34.160 --> 1:39:36.160]  maybe 20 to 35 if you want
[1:39:36.160 --> 1:39:38.160]  some false positives, but never over 35.
[1:39:38.160 --> 1:39:40.160]  We have a whole world of lab
[1:39:40.160 --> 1:39:42.160]  managers now setting up to cycle these
[1:39:42.160 --> 1:39:44.160]  from 40 to 50
[1:39:44.160 --> 1:39:46.160]  times, you know, 35
[1:39:46.160 --> 1:39:48.160]  above to 50 times, and maybe
[1:39:48.160 --> 1:39:50.160]  more. So you have to
[1:39:50.160 --> 1:39:52.160]  either believe that in 2020
[1:39:52.160 --> 1:39:54.160]  you had a world psychosis of lab
[1:39:54.160 --> 1:39:56.160]  managers. Everybody just lost their way
[1:39:56.160 --> 1:39:58.160]  all of a sudden. They had some kind of brain blip.
[1:39:58.160 --> 1:40:00.160]  And they all did
[1:40:00.160 --> 1:40:02.160]  the wrong thing. And interestingly, they all did the wrong
[1:40:02.160 --> 1:40:04.160]  thing in the same direction. None
[1:40:04.160 --> 1:40:06.160]  of them accidentally under-cycled.
[1:40:06.160 --> 1:40:08.160]  That's one world view.
[1:40:08.160 --> 1:40:10.160]  Or you have to believe that they
[1:40:10.160 --> 1:40:12.160]  were all told to over-cycle the test.
[1:40:12.160 --> 1:40:14.160]  And so that means there is
[1:40:14.160 --> 1:40:16.160]  the criminal blueprint
[1:40:16.160 --> 1:40:18.160]  of that. Where is the FBI?
[1:40:18.160 --> 1:40:20.160]  There is a group saying, fraudulently
[1:40:20.160 --> 1:40:22.160]  do this, shut the country down.
[1:40:22.160 --> 1:40:24.160]  Right. And who could that group be?
[1:40:24.160 --> 1:40:26.160]  It couldn't be, you know, a hospital
[1:40:26.160 --> 1:40:28.160]  CEO, because all the hospitals
[1:40:28.160 --> 1:40:30.160]  did it. Now it's only the NIH and it's only the CDC.
[1:40:30.160 --> 1:40:32.160]  And it's the UN.
[1:40:32.160 --> 1:40:34.160]  Well, it has to go bigger than that because
[1:40:34.160 --> 1:40:36.160]  it isn't just our states and our
[1:40:36.160 --> 1:40:38.160]  country, it's worldwide.
[1:40:38.160 --> 1:40:40.160]  So somebody at a transnational
[1:40:40.160 --> 1:40:42.160]  level
[1:40:42.160 --> 1:40:44.160]  told people to over-cycle
[1:40:44.160 --> 1:40:46.160]  all these tests. And what could the purpose be?
[1:40:46.160 --> 1:40:48.160]  The purpose, because I don't believe
[1:40:48.160 --> 1:40:50.160]  and I don't think most people believe in the group psychosis
[1:40:50.160 --> 1:40:52.160]  theory of lab managers.
[1:40:52.160 --> 1:40:54.160]  So what could the purpose of this be?
[1:40:54.160 --> 1:40:56.160]  There's only one outcome of it.
[1:40:56.160 --> 1:40:58.160]  To make this disease look scary
[1:40:58.160 --> 1:41:00.160]  and worse, to get everybody in
[1:41:00.160 --> 1:41:02.160]  fear for the second stage
[1:41:02.160 --> 1:41:04.160]  of the takedown, which really
[1:41:04.160 --> 1:41:06.160]  follows, you know,
[1:41:06.160 --> 1:41:08.160]  Benjamin's chart of coercion, the
[1:41:08.160 --> 1:41:10.160]  psychologists that looked at prisoners of war
[1:41:10.160 --> 1:41:12.160]  coming back of Korea. He said, if you want to get
[1:41:12.160 --> 1:41:14.160]  them what they did, because the government
[1:41:14.160 --> 1:41:16.160]  said, the Chinese give them some kind of
[1:41:16.160 --> 1:41:18.160]  potion or the Koreans, you know, what
[1:41:18.160 --> 1:41:20.160]  happened to these guys, that they now hate their country.
[1:41:20.160 --> 1:41:22.160]  That was where we got the term brainwashing
[1:41:22.160 --> 1:41:24.160]  and Manchurian candidate. And what Dr.
[1:41:24.160 --> 1:41:26.160]  Benjamin said is, no, it was just
[1:41:26.160 --> 1:41:28.160]  standard psychological techniques.
[1:41:28.160 --> 1:41:30.160]  What do you do? First, you isolate people,
[1:41:30.160 --> 1:41:32.160]  think the lockdowns.
[1:41:32.160 --> 1:41:34.160]  The second thing you do, yeah, there it is.
[1:41:34.160 --> 1:41:36.160]  The second thing you do,
[1:41:36.160 --> 1:41:38.160]  you monopolize their perception.
[1:41:38.160 --> 1:41:40.160]  You constantly, these people that might
[1:41:40.160 --> 1:41:42.160]  have listened to half an hour of the news
[1:41:42.160 --> 1:41:44.160]  every night, now are listening to nonstop
[1:41:44.160 --> 1:41:46.160]  CNN or whatever, and they're getting
[1:41:46.160 --> 1:41:48.160]  this constant fear drummed into them
[1:41:48.160 --> 1:41:50.160]  that the whole world is dying and if
[1:41:50.160 --> 1:41:52.160]  you go outside your house without a mask, you're
[1:41:52.160 --> 1:41:54.160]  going to have a problem. And then
[1:41:54.160 --> 1:41:56.160]  it doesn't, and then, you know, I'm going to
[1:41:56.160 --> 1:41:58.160]  say that there's a lot of other things you do,
[1:41:58.160 --> 1:42:00.160]  but including one we should
[1:42:00.160 --> 1:42:02.160]  watch out for, and that is you get more
[1:42:02.160 --> 1:42:04.160]  freedom for a while and then they clamp it down
[1:42:04.160 --> 1:42:06.160]  again, look at Australia.
[1:42:06.160 --> 1:42:08.160]  But the real next step was creating
[1:42:08.160 --> 1:42:10.160]  confusion, because when you
[1:42:10.160 --> 1:42:12.160]  add fear and confusion,
[1:42:12.160 --> 1:42:14.160]  you get Stockholm syndrome patients.
[1:42:14.160 --> 1:42:16.160]  You get people that are, will bend
[1:42:16.160 --> 1:42:18.160]  to your will just to get out of this
[1:42:18.160 --> 1:42:20.160]  anxiety zone you've created. And I learned
[1:42:20.160 --> 1:42:22.160]  this from a child psychologist, psychiatrist,
[1:42:22.160 --> 1:42:24.160]  friend of mine in LA.
[1:42:24.160 --> 1:42:26.160]  And we've only got one more segment, hopefully
[1:42:26.160 --> 1:42:28.160]  you can do a little bit in the next hour,
[1:42:28.160 --> 1:42:30.160]  because I want to give you the floor, you're right.
[1:42:30.160 --> 1:42:32.160]  I call it Mass Stockholm Syndrome.
[1:42:32.160 --> 1:42:34.160]  What are the ways to deprogram
[1:42:34.160 --> 1:42:36.160]  people out of that, because
[1:42:36.160 --> 1:42:38.160]  you can see this is literally the
[1:42:38.160 --> 1:42:40.160]  Manchurian candidate, this is happening
[1:42:40.160 --> 1:42:42.160]  for real, themedicalrebel.com

[1:43:28.160 --> 1:43:30.160]  dictatorship under the UN.
[1:43:30.160 --> 1:43:32.160]  They admit all of this.
[1:43:32.160 --> 1:43:34.160]  They plan the lock-downs, they release
[1:43:34.160 --> 1:43:36.160]  the viruses, they think you're
[1:43:36.160 --> 1:43:38.160]  stupid, and their plan is to slowly
[1:43:38.160 --> 1:43:40.160]  cut off the resources so they can
[1:43:40.160 --> 1:43:42.160]  dictate total social control over
[1:43:42.160 --> 1:43:44.160]  you and your lives. That's how I was
[1:43:44.160 --> 1:43:46.160]  able to predict everything they did
[1:43:46.160 --> 1:43:48.160]  decades before they executed it.
[1:43:48.160 --> 1:43:50.160]  Word for word with total
[1:43:50.160 --> 1:43:52.160]  5 weekdays, 11am to 3pm
[1:43:52.160 --> 1:43:54.160]  at infowars.com for a live show.
[1:43:54.160 --> 1:43:56.160]  Tell everybody to tune in now and
[1:43:56.160 --> 1:43:58.160]  war the world.
[1:43:58.160 --> 1:44:00.160]  So, when I first started taking
[1:44:00.160 --> 1:44:02.160]  Survival Shield, basically I was
[1:44:02.160 --> 1:44:04.160]  275 pounds, I was overweight. I had
[1:44:04.160 --> 1:44:06.160]  brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[1:44:06.160 --> 1:44:08.160]  I was barely holding onto a job, and
[1:44:08.160 --> 1:44:10.160]  I heard Dr. Grip on your show and I
[1:44:10.160 --> 1:44:12.160]  listened to it. So the first one I got
[1:44:12.160 --> 1:44:14.160]  was the original Survival Shield, the X1.
[1:44:14.160 --> 1:44:16.160]  And it worked pretty good, and then
[1:44:16.160 --> 1:44:18.160]  shortly thereafter you came out with
[1:44:18.160 --> 1:44:20.160]  the original Survival Shield, and
[1:44:20.160 --> 1:44:22.160]  I was really excited about that.
[1:44:22.160 --> 1:44:24.160]  So I took it, and then in two weeks
[1:44:24.160 --> 1:44:26.160]  I went from brain fog to
[1:44:26.160 --> 1:44:28.160]  literally like my brain was
[1:44:28.160 --> 1:44:30.160]  enlightened. I could think
[1:44:30.160 --> 1:44:32.160]  again, I could connect with people
[1:44:32.160 --> 1:44:34.160]  again. And over the course of the
[1:44:34.160 --> 1:44:36.160]  next couple of years I got my help
[1:44:36.160 --> 1:44:38.160]  back, and I religiously take
[1:44:38.160 --> 1:44:40.160]  basically all of your supplements.
[1:44:40.160 --> 1:44:42.160]  They're all absolutely amazing
[1:44:42.160 --> 1:44:44.160]  supplements. The one I like recently
[1:44:44.160 --> 1:44:46.160]  is Knockout. It literally like if you
[1:44:46.160 --> 1:44:48.160]  break free of the globalist system
[1:44:48.160 --> 1:44:50.160]  and the only way to do that is to take
[1:44:50.160 --> 1:44:52.160]  our own health into our own hand.
[1:44:52.160 --> 1:44:54.160]  Beautifully said, brother. I thank you so much
[1:44:54.160 --> 1:44:56.160]  for your call and Godspeed.
[1:44:58.160 --> 1:45:00.160]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been
[1:45:00.160 --> 1:45:02.160]  warning you about for 27 years
[1:45:02.160 --> 1:45:04.160]  has now gone from beta testing
[1:45:04.160 --> 1:45:06.160]  to operational. The globalists
[1:45:06.160 --> 1:45:08.160]  are out on the open with their planetary
[1:45:08.160 --> 1:45:10.160]  depopulation takeover, their robot
[1:45:10.160 --> 1:45:12.160]  takeover. But the good news is
[1:45:12.160 --> 1:45:14.160]  we've been working and you've been working, and
[1:45:14.160 --> 1:45:16.160]  others have been working across the planet for decades
[1:45:16.160 --> 1:45:18.160]  to get ready for this, to be able to
[1:45:18.160 --> 1:45:20.160]  find it off. Humanity is strong.
[1:45:20.160 --> 1:45:22.160]  We're incredible. And if we're aware
[1:45:22.160 --> 1:45:24.160]  of the attack that's happening, we have a real chance
[1:45:24.160 --> 1:45:26.160]  of defeating it. If we ask God for guidance
[1:45:26.160 --> 1:45:28.160]  we will defeat it. So prayer
[1:45:28.160 --> 1:45:30.160]  is essential, research is essential,
[1:45:30.160 --> 1:45:32.160]  getting prepared is essential, and warning others
[1:45:32.160 --> 1:45:34.160]  is absolutely essential. And at the same
[1:45:34.160 --> 1:45:36.160]  time supporting info wars
[1:45:36.160 --> 1:45:38.160]  by buying high quality products to keep us
[1:45:38.160 --> 1:45:40.160]  on air is essential because they're great
[1:45:40.160 --> 1:45:42.160]  products for you and your family, and they're also
[1:45:42.160 --> 1:45:44.160]  funding our operation.
[1:45:44.160 --> 1:45:46.160]  Infowarsstore.com
[1:45:46.160 --> 1:45:48.160]  Infowarsstore.com is incredible.
[1:45:48.160 --> 1:45:50.160]  A lot of our products that have been sold out because
[1:45:50.160 --> 1:45:52.160]  the supply chain breakdowns are back in like
[1:45:52.160 --> 1:45:54.160]  bodies, vasobetes, and others. So get
[1:45:54.160 --> 1:45:56.160]  them today at Infowarsstore.com and I thank
[1:45:56.160 --> 1:45:58.160]  you for being part of the resistance.
[1:45:58.160 --> 1:46:00.160]  Not all vitamin and mineral
[1:46:00.160 --> 1:46:02.160]  supplements are equal.
[1:46:02.160 --> 1:46:04.160]  Many of them are synthetic. Many of them have
[1:46:04.160 --> 1:46:06.160]  fillers and additives. Many of them just pass
[1:46:06.160 --> 1:46:08.160]  right through the body and are not absorbed.
[1:46:08.160 --> 1:46:10.160]  But that's not the case with our incredibly
[1:46:10.160 --> 1:46:12.160]  popular because it's so effective
[1:46:12.160 --> 1:46:14.160]  product that has now been sold out
[1:46:14.160 --> 1:46:16.160]  for months, but it's finally back
[1:46:16.160 --> 1:46:18.160]  in stone. And that is
[1:46:18.160 --> 1:46:20.160]  vitamin, mineral fusion. All the
[1:46:20.160 --> 1:46:22.160]  essential vitamins, all the essential
[1:46:22.160 --> 1:46:24.160]  minerals, a bunch of keomino acids to help
[1:46:24.160 --> 1:46:26.160]  it upload better into your body and your
[1:46:26.160 --> 1:46:28.160]  cells. It's in powder form.
[1:46:28.160 --> 1:46:30.160]  It's great for children. It's great for adults.
[1:46:30.160 --> 1:46:32.160]  It's really important for folks that are older
[1:46:32.160 --> 1:46:34.160]  because they don't absorb as well through
[1:46:34.160 --> 1:46:36.160]  their guts. So this liquid formula
[1:46:36.160 --> 1:46:38.160]  really, really does it. It makes up a picture
[1:46:38.160 --> 1:46:40.160]  of it every couple of days. Put it in the
[1:46:40.160 --> 1:46:42.160]  refrigerator or keep it out in the kitchen
[1:46:42.160 --> 1:46:44.160]  and just remember to drink it in the morning
[1:46:44.160 --> 1:46:46.160]  and in the evening. It tastes great.
[1:46:46.160 --> 1:46:48.160]  It makes your body healthy. It boosts your
[1:46:48.160 --> 1:46:50.160]  immune system and it funds
[1:46:50.160 --> 1:46:52.160]  the Info War. A true 360
[1:46:52.160 --> 1:46:54.160]  win. So vitamin, mineral fusion sold out
[1:46:54.160 --> 1:46:56.160]  for months is back in stone for a limited time

[1:47:26.160 --> 1:47:28.160]  When we look at the
[1:47:28.160 --> 1:47:30.160]  risks, when we look at the risks,
[1:47:30.160 --> 1:47:32.160]  when we look at the risks, there's
[1:47:32.160 --> 1:47:34.160]  major movements against their takeover
[1:47:34.160 --> 1:47:36.160]  and in their own white papers like
[1:47:36.160 --> 1:47:38.160]  Lockstep by the Rockefellers,
[1:47:38.160 --> 1:47:40.160]  the Rockefeller Foundation
[1:47:40.160 --> 1:47:42.160]  now officially runs
[1:47:42.160 --> 1:47:44.160]  the White House response to COVID
[1:47:44.160 --> 1:47:46.160]  and runs the UN response. Gates
[1:47:46.160 --> 1:47:48.160]  was the front guy for them, but he's been
[1:47:48.160 --> 1:47:50.160]  partially removed. And
[1:47:50.160 --> 1:47:52.160]  they're doing this. And now
[1:47:52.160 --> 1:47:54.160]  last year, I want to ask our
[1:47:54.160 --> 1:47:55.640]  and the numbers were basically the same
[1:47:55.640 --> 1:47:57.120]  as she said in the curve.
[1:47:57.120 --> 1:47:58.800]  Well, before the numbers came out in the last month,
[1:47:58.800 --> 1:48:01.320]  I could see it, because we deal with warehouses
[1:48:01.320 --> 1:48:02.280]  and we deal with a lot of things
[1:48:02.280 --> 1:48:05.120]  and I've got family that works in the medical sector
[1:48:05.120 --> 1:48:07.160]  and I talked to people all over the country and the world
[1:48:07.160 --> 1:48:11.120]  and they said, my God, especially the US compared anywhere,
[1:48:11.120 --> 1:48:14.420]  it's hospitals full, all sorts of weird viruses,
[1:48:14.420 --> 1:48:16.600]  people super sick and now it's in the news,
[1:48:16.600 --> 1:48:18.960]  oh, there's something like polio but it's different
[1:48:18.960 --> 1:48:20.720]  and oh, there's these other diseases
[1:48:20.720 --> 1:48:22.720]  and oh, there's super viruses
[1:48:22.720 --> 1:48:24.640]  and then I've been talking to some former heads
[1:48:24.640 --> 1:48:27.320]  of US intelligence agencies and a lot of medical doctors
[1:48:27.320 --> 1:48:30.400]  and they say the consensus is what you just said, doctor,
[1:48:30.400 --> 1:48:33.480]  that they're releasing a synthetic protein
[1:48:33.480 --> 1:48:36.440]  that has the viral effect but it's not the virus,
[1:48:36.440 --> 1:48:39.200]  it's basically a biological poison show
[1:48:39.200 --> 1:48:41.360]  they can cover it up and that's why they did a few cities
[1:48:41.360 --> 1:48:45.120]  to scare the pathologist and people around the world
[1:48:45.120 --> 1:48:47.120]  to get behind the lockdowns
[1:48:47.120 --> 1:48:49.360]  but then you also have the viral shedding going on
[1:48:49.360 --> 1:48:52.080]  so looking at that, Dr. Lee Merritt,
[1:48:52.080 --> 1:48:54.400]  how do we, again, counter something like this
[1:48:54.400 --> 1:48:56.200]  and what do you expect to come next
[1:48:56.200 --> 1:48:58.840]  and what numbers are you actually seeing on the ground
[1:48:58.840 --> 1:49:02.360]  because I can tell you, 80% of the people I know
[1:49:02.360 --> 1:49:04.760]  have been sick the last two months.
[1:49:04.760 --> 1:49:06.960]  I mean, it's been hell here in Austin.
[1:49:06.960 --> 1:49:09.240]  I've got family that sold out of a bunch of stuff
[1:49:09.240 --> 1:49:11.600]  but they owned a bunch of dental offices,
[1:49:11.600 --> 1:49:13.680]  half those are closed right now because of this,
[1:49:13.680 --> 1:49:16.480]  I mean, on the ground we're seeing devastating
[1:49:16.480 --> 1:49:18.480]  real life numbers, what are you hearing?
[1:49:18.480 --> 1:49:21.760]  Well, yeah, I think a couple things about the numbers,
[1:49:21.760 --> 1:49:25.760]  you know, last year we didn't build one new cemetery, okay?
[1:49:25.760 --> 1:49:28.080]  I mean, that tells you something.
[1:49:28.080 --> 1:49:31.280]  If you look at the world data, which they don't make
[1:49:31.280 --> 1:49:34.040]  our data that easy to find that they're always two years
[1:49:34.040 --> 1:49:36.760]  late to tell you how many people died in the U.S.
[1:49:36.760 --> 1:49:39.720]  but world data shows it was basically the same death rate
[1:49:39.720 --> 1:49:41.200]  last year as it was the year before
[1:49:41.200 --> 1:49:42.040]  and the year before in the U.S.
[1:49:42.040 --> 1:49:44.080]  It was different, okay?
[1:49:44.080 --> 1:49:46.880]  Now that isn't to say there isn't something going on
[1:49:46.880 --> 1:49:50.640]  but it's not perhaps what we have been told,
[1:49:50.640 --> 1:49:52.680]  I don't think it is what we've been told
[1:49:52.680 --> 1:49:55.800]  and all this nonsense about,
[1:49:55.800 --> 1:49:58.320]  and well, let me just say,
[1:49:58.320 --> 1:50:00.200]  I talked to you about the cycling of the tests
[1:50:00.200 --> 1:50:01.880]  and they claim they're going to correct that
[1:50:01.880 --> 1:50:03.640]  as of January 1st or whatever
[1:50:03.640 --> 1:50:05.080]  and they're gonna change the test
[1:50:05.080 --> 1:50:07.680]  but I think one of the other things to say about these tests
[1:50:07.680 --> 1:50:10.680]  and this makes everything suspect about what's going on
[1:50:10.680 --> 1:50:13.400]  and why people are dying now.
[1:50:13.400 --> 1:50:15.640]  I took, you know, these tests were developed
[1:50:15.640 --> 1:50:17.840]  like three different places,
[1:50:17.840 --> 1:50:21.200]  the Louis Pasteur Institute in Europe,
[1:50:21.200 --> 1:50:23.360]  the CDC and the Drosten tests
[1:50:23.360 --> 1:50:25.640]  and they give you, it turns out, I just found,
[1:50:25.640 --> 1:50:28.640]  you can find the genomic sequence on these tests
[1:50:28.640 --> 1:50:30.080]  that they're using for the different,
[1:50:30.080 --> 1:50:32.800]  they each have three proteins they're looking for,
[1:50:32.800 --> 1:50:35.720]  they developed these to theoretically diagnose COVID,
[1:50:35.720 --> 1:50:39.560]  right, to diagnose SARS-CoV-2, a virus, they say.
[1:50:39.560 --> 1:50:42.080]  I ran those genetic sequences through BLAST.
[1:50:42.080 --> 1:50:44.440]  BLAST is the, if you have a little,
[1:50:44.440 --> 1:50:47.120]  if I see a squish something on the floor,
[1:50:47.120 --> 1:50:48.760]  I wanna know what it is and I scrape it up
[1:50:48.760 --> 1:50:51.240]  and I get it, I prime it, I put primers down there
[1:50:51.240 --> 1:50:53.160]  and figure out the genetic sequence of the stuff,
[1:50:53.160 --> 1:50:56.040]  I can put it into BLAST and it tells me the closest fit.
[1:50:56.040 --> 1:50:59.400]  Oh, that's a banana or that's a chimpanzee, you know,
[1:50:59.400 --> 1:51:00.440]  gene three.
[1:51:00.440 --> 1:51:03.520]  Well, I put all these PCR tests,
[1:51:03.520 --> 1:51:05.760]  they're theoretically testing for SARS-CoV-2,
[1:51:05.760 --> 1:51:09.680]  expecting that I would get some SARS-CoV-2 pop up,
[1:51:09.680 --> 1:51:14.240]  everyone popped up homosapiens, different genes.
[1:51:14.240 --> 1:51:16.360]  In other words, we're being tested to ourselves,
[1:51:16.360 --> 1:51:17.720]  it looks like.
[1:51:17.720 --> 1:51:19.040]  Now, I'm waiting for somebody else.
[1:51:19.040 --> 1:51:20.000]  Well, you're the doctors,
[1:51:20.000 --> 1:51:22.480]  so quantify that for those of us that are ignorant.
[1:51:22.480 --> 1:51:23.840]  What does that mean?
[1:51:23.840 --> 1:51:26.600]  They're not testing for the gene of SARS-CoV-2,
[1:51:26.600 --> 1:51:29.240]  they're testing for our own human genetics.
[1:51:30.080 --> 1:51:31.840]  So they're going, oh, you're human,
[1:51:31.840 --> 1:51:34.520]  that means you're positive, you're the disease.
[1:51:34.520 --> 1:51:36.320]  So it's creating this year, in other words,
[1:51:36.320 --> 1:51:40.520]  another huge, huge, vast falsehood.
[1:51:40.520 --> 1:51:43.120]  We don't, we haven't really isolated the virus,
[1:51:43.120 --> 1:51:44.560]  we don't know what we're dealing with,
[1:51:44.560 --> 1:51:45.640]  and we have false tests.
[1:51:45.640 --> 1:51:47.880]  So now here's the problem, and I can tell you,
[1:51:47.880 --> 1:51:49.520]  this is a problem that hit my family,
[1:51:49.520 --> 1:51:51.160]  both my husband and I were very sick,
[1:51:51.160 --> 1:51:53.720]  and he ended up in the hospital in spite of my best efforts.
[1:51:53.720 --> 1:51:55.000]  That's what I'm seeing, I'm seeing,
[1:51:55.000 --> 1:51:58.000]  nothing was going on last year, all hell's breaking loose.
[1:51:58.000 --> 1:52:00.600]  I don't need to read the newspaper, I can see it.
[1:52:00.600 --> 1:52:03.000]  So there's a couple of things that could be going on,
[1:52:03.000 --> 1:52:05.160]  one is, and I think this may be part of it,
[1:52:05.160 --> 1:52:07.360]  there may be spreading something else, we don't know,
[1:52:07.360 --> 1:52:10.920]  can't prove that, but what I can absolutely prove,
[1:52:10.920 --> 1:52:14.320]  is that there's a double head fake going on with physicians.
[1:52:14.320 --> 1:52:15.840]  And what's happened is now,
[1:52:15.840 --> 1:52:18.920]  everybody is thinking we're all treating COVID,
[1:52:18.920 --> 1:52:21.680]  we're all treating a virus, okay?
[1:52:21.680 --> 1:52:24.360]  And, you know, they've suppressed all the literature
[1:52:24.360 --> 1:52:28.440]  that shows you, you know, 83 period studies on ivermectin,
[1:52:28.440 --> 1:52:31.400]  over 200 on hydroxychloroquine, that those drugs work.
[1:52:31.400 --> 1:52:34.760]  So when you go into a hospital, several things happen.
[1:52:34.760 --> 1:52:36.920]  The first thing that happens is,
[1:52:36.920 --> 1:52:38.840]  what would have happened 10 years ago,
[1:52:38.840 --> 1:52:40.960]  if you came in short of breath, coughing,
[1:52:40.960 --> 1:52:42.680]  having a chest x-ray, it's got infiltrate,
[1:52:42.680 --> 1:52:43.880]  what would they treat you for?
[1:52:43.880 --> 1:52:46.080]  They treat you with antibiotics for pneumonia.
[1:52:46.080 --> 1:52:48.680]  And many people were saved by that, okay?
[1:52:48.680 --> 1:52:50.120]  That's a classic treatment.
[1:52:50.120 --> 1:52:50.960]  But now-
[1:52:50.960 --> 1:52:52.920]  Exactly, one of my own crew members, Rob Dew, went,
[1:52:52.920 --> 1:52:54.200]  they wouldn't even get a antibiotics,
[1:52:54.200 --> 1:52:55.840]  he got out, took them and got better.
[1:52:55.840 --> 1:52:57.680]  They wouldn't even give him that in Austin.
[1:52:57.680 --> 1:52:59.440]  What default would be give antibiotics,
[1:52:59.440 --> 1:53:00.920]  they don't do it now.
[1:53:00.920 --> 1:53:02.400]  Because they probably gave him a test,
[1:53:02.400 --> 1:53:03.640]  said, oh, you're positive for COVID,
[1:53:03.640 --> 1:53:05.920]  so we don't treat that with antibiotics.
[1:53:05.920 --> 1:53:07.440]  And that's the problem here,
[1:53:07.440 --> 1:53:10.040]  is that we're forgetting all those other pulmonary diseases,
[1:53:10.040 --> 1:53:11.240]  all the other things that can happen.
[1:53:11.240 --> 1:53:15.000]  Even, I mean, one of a staff member's father died
[1:53:15.000 --> 1:53:19.400]  because he had what sounded like a bowel obstruction.
[1:53:19.400 --> 1:53:20.960]  He was a 50-year physician.
[1:53:20.960 --> 1:53:24.080]  He went into the hospital, positive for COVID,
[1:53:24.080 --> 1:53:26.080]  and they took him into isolation room
[1:53:26.080 --> 1:53:28.480]  and had no work up for his bowel and died.
[1:53:28.480 --> 1:53:32.360]  I mean, I have to say, this is part of the takedown.
[1:53:32.360 --> 1:53:33.200]  I don't think-
[1:53:33.200 --> 1:53:34.800]  Sure, it's a takeover of medicine
[1:53:34.800 --> 1:53:36.120]  where they don't do regular tests,
[1:53:36.120 --> 1:53:38.680]  they just say it's COVID and you die.
[1:53:38.680 --> 1:53:41.240]  And one of the problems here, this is a big problem,
[1:53:41.240 --> 1:53:43.160]  so I'm not saying there isn't something out here.
[1:53:43.160 --> 1:53:45.680]  But if it is one of these nanoparticles
[1:53:45.680 --> 1:53:46.720]  that we've been infected with,
[1:53:46.720 --> 1:53:49.120]  similar to the ones we've already been infected with,
[1:53:49.120 --> 1:53:50.640]  we now have some strategies.
[1:53:50.640 --> 1:53:52.280]  I've got them outlined on my side,
[1:53:52.280 --> 1:53:55.960]  but good doctors like Dr. Zelenko and Didier Raoul
[1:53:55.960 --> 1:54:00.960]  and Dr. Corey, all these guys, they figured out things.
[1:54:01.200 --> 1:54:03.760]  And Dr. McCullough put bravely at the cost of his job,
[1:54:03.760 --> 1:54:05.480]  put all these things together.
[1:54:05.480 --> 1:54:07.920]  We're listening, our hospitals are listening
[1:54:07.920 --> 1:54:10.760]  to people like Tony Fauci that are not treating physicians.
[1:54:10.760 --> 1:54:13.160]  And they're not listening to people like Brian Tyson,
[1:54:13.160 --> 1:54:14.920]  my friend in El Centro.
[1:54:14.920 --> 1:54:18.440]  He's seen, he has treated over 6,200 patients.
[1:54:18.440 --> 1:54:19.960]  The people that came to see him,
[1:54:19.960 --> 1:54:22.680]  he's only had seven deaths and two hospitalizations.
[1:54:22.680 --> 1:54:25.560]  But those are people that, and those all were people,
[1:54:25.560 --> 1:54:27.840]  the deaths were all in people that came too late.
[1:54:27.840 --> 1:54:29.640]  They came after seven days.
[1:54:29.640 --> 1:54:34.000]  So the issue here is, we know we have lots of treatments.
[1:54:34.000 --> 1:54:36.280]  We've got to get immediate treatment.
[1:54:36.280 --> 1:54:37.280]  We've got to, yeah.
[1:54:37.280 --> 1:54:40.880]  We've got to remind doctors to treat people like you did.
[1:54:40.880 --> 1:54:42.720]  Remember how you treated people 10 years ago
[1:54:42.720 --> 1:54:46.680]  or even three years ago when we had the maximum medicine.
[1:54:46.680 --> 1:54:48.640]  It's one thing to miss untreatable disease,
[1:54:48.640 --> 1:54:50.560]  but no one ever missed treatable disease.
[1:54:50.560 --> 1:54:51.400]  Well, Doc, let's go back.
[1:54:51.400 --> 1:54:52.240]  I'm on a doctor like you,
[1:54:52.240 --> 1:54:53.680]  but I remember a year and a half ago
[1:54:53.680 --> 1:54:55.320]  when the COVID was going around,
[1:54:55.320 --> 1:54:57.760]  they'd say, stay at home until you can't breathe.
[1:54:57.760 --> 1:55:00.920]  Well, regular folks with pneumonia weren't getting anything.
[1:55:00.920 --> 1:55:02.320]  They're still doing it.
[1:55:02.320 --> 1:55:03.160]  They go to the hospital,
[1:55:03.160 --> 1:55:05.520]  they say you're not sick enough for treatment yet.
[1:55:05.520 --> 1:55:09.120]  Now, the idea of the hospital's being full,
[1:55:09.120 --> 1:55:10.320]  I haven't observed that.
[1:55:10.320 --> 1:55:12.480]  I mean, I'm not working anymore in a hospital,
[1:55:12.480 --> 1:55:13.800]  somewhat thanks to this,
[1:55:13.800 --> 1:55:16.400]  but I hear people that do.
[1:55:16.400 --> 1:55:18.000]  There are a lot of nurses squeaking out there
[1:55:18.000 --> 1:55:19.960]  and they say, no, we're not overwhelmed.
[1:55:19.960 --> 1:55:20.800]  No, I agree.
[1:55:20.800 --> 1:55:21.640]  A lot of places aren't,
[1:55:21.640 --> 1:55:23.480]  a lot of nurses have quit over forced circulation.
[1:55:23.480 --> 1:55:26.160]  I'm just saying, last year was quiet
[1:55:26.160 --> 1:55:27.840]  compared to even the year before from when I saw.
[1:55:27.840 --> 1:55:30.880]  This year, there's a lot of crazy stuff going on in.
[1:55:30.880 --> 1:55:32.640]  The evidence, I've got all the articles right here.
[1:55:32.640 --> 1:55:34.680]  Doc, can you speak to this?
[1:55:34.680 --> 1:55:36.560]  That most of the people dying
[1:55:36.560 --> 1:55:40.000]  or most of the folks in the hospital have been vaccinated.
[1:55:40.000 --> 1:55:41.160]  Yeah, and that's another thing
[1:55:41.160 --> 1:55:42.920]  they're not telling you the truth about.
[1:55:42.920 --> 1:55:47.240]  You know, Pfizer, when they first vaccinated the Israelis,
[1:55:47.240 --> 1:55:48.960]  okay, it's kind of a good test
[1:55:48.960 --> 1:55:51.960]  because it's one country, kind of homogeneous
[1:55:51.960 --> 1:55:55.480]  and they use one vaccine, the Pfizer vaccine.
[1:55:55.480 --> 1:55:58.440]  At a time, and the government released data
[1:55:58.440 --> 1:56:01.040]  like mid-February, it was reviewed
[1:56:01.040 --> 1:56:04.080]  by some Israelis living in France.
[1:56:04.080 --> 1:56:06.600]  Dr. Seligman, who was an epidemiologist from Marseille
[1:56:06.600 --> 1:56:10.000]  and his partner, Yatif, who's an engineer.
[1:56:10.000 --> 1:56:11.400]  These guys reviewed the data.
[1:56:11.400 --> 1:56:16.240]  At the time that 12.5% of the Israelis had been vaccinated,
[1:56:16.240 --> 1:56:18.680]  51% of the deaths from COVID,
[1:56:18.680 --> 1:56:20.960]  the disease we're supposed to be vaccinating against,
[1:56:20.960 --> 1:56:22.600]  were in vaccinated people.
[1:56:23.480 --> 1:56:24.720]  And then when they looked at,
[1:56:24.720 --> 1:56:27.080]  they broke it down by age, Dr. Seligman
[1:56:27.080 --> 1:56:29.680]  and his partner came out and they said, look it.
[1:56:29.680 --> 1:56:32.880]  Yeah, the government tells you it's 95% effective.
[1:56:32.880 --> 1:56:34.400]  That's a talking point.
[1:56:34.400 --> 1:56:36.360]  Again, every time you hear there's 95 number,
[1:56:36.360 --> 1:56:38.280]  I swear that's just a propaganda
[1:56:38.280 --> 1:56:40.040]  from our intelligence services.
[1:56:40.040 --> 1:56:42.800]  The real number was, if you were over 65
[1:56:42.800 --> 1:56:44.280]  and you took the vaccine,
[1:56:44.280 --> 1:56:48.400]  you were 40 times more likely to die of COVID.
[1:56:48.400 --> 1:56:51.240]  And if you were under 29, it was even worse.
[1:56:51.240 --> 1:56:54.440]  I mean, the damage versus if you'd just been left alone
[1:56:54.440 --> 1:56:56.040]  because under 29 year old people don't die
[1:56:56.040 --> 1:56:57.840]  to begin with of COVID.
[1:56:57.840 --> 1:57:00.920]  And so that's happening all over now.
[1:57:00.920 --> 1:57:02.600]  I think I heard Massachusetts,
[1:57:02.600 --> 1:57:04.680]  there was something like 70% of the people
[1:57:04.680 --> 1:57:06.920]  that were in the ICU were vaccinated.
[1:57:06.920 --> 1:57:08.760]  If part of the problem,
[1:57:08.760 --> 1:57:10.200]  they're gonna lie to you about these numbers,
[1:57:10.200 --> 1:57:14.200]  don't be confused and don't be confused about Delta variants.
[1:57:14.200 --> 1:57:16.160]  I mean, even if there is a Delta variant,
[1:57:16.160 --> 1:57:19.000]  their own numbers show it's the least deadly out there.
[1:57:19.000 --> 1:57:21.880]  So, you know, you had my friend Kate Daly on here,
[1:57:21.880 --> 1:57:24.040]  she's very funny and she calls anybody that believes
[1:57:24.040 --> 1:57:25.240]  in these variants is a member
[1:57:25.240 --> 1:57:27.960]  of the Lambda Delta Nu fraternity from morons.
[1:57:27.960 --> 1:57:29.360]  Sure, stay there then.
[1:57:29.360 --> 1:57:30.720]  Thought we had two more segments with you.
[1:57:30.720 --> 1:57:32.280]  I wanna hear you just lay out
[1:57:32.280 --> 1:57:34.720]  what you think we should do, how we should counter,
[1:57:34.720 --> 1:57:37.520]  should we see the indictment of Fauci, the bag man,
[1:57:37.520 --> 1:57:39.000]  because that's the way to shut down these guys
[1:57:39.000 --> 1:57:40.040]  being the authority,
[1:57:40.040 --> 1:57:42.720]  is to expose the authors of this takeover.
[1:57:42.720 --> 1:57:44.520]  Hour number three, stay with us.
[1:57:47.160 --> 1:57:49.200]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night
[1:57:49.200 --> 1:57:51.440]  in mid-April, 2021.
[1:57:51.440 --> 1:57:52.520]  And I just wanna say something.
[1:57:52.520 --> 1:57:55.920]  I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew
[1:57:55.920 --> 1:57:57.440]  that has come together over the years
[1:57:57.440 --> 1:57:58.760]  and it's truly an answer to prayer.
[1:57:58.760 --> 1:58:00.680]  And I am so blessed and thankful
[1:58:00.680 --> 1:58:02.280]  for all of you, the listeners of this show.
[1:58:02.280 --> 1:58:05.160]  I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you.
[1:58:05.160 --> 1:58:06.280]  Whether you are old,
[1:58:06.280 --> 1:58:08.000]  whether you are Hispanic, white, black,
[1:58:08.000 --> 1:58:09.720]  it doesn't matter, you got red blood.
[1:58:09.720 --> 1:58:11.200]  And if you love freedom and justice,
[1:58:11.200 --> 1:58:13.520]  and if you love our innocent children,
[1:58:13.520 --> 1:58:15.840]  we are brothers and sisters together,
[1:58:15.840 --> 1:58:18.600]  and it has just been an incredible experience
[1:58:18.600 --> 1:58:20.160]  to work with you over the years.
[1:58:20.160 --> 1:58:21.800]  And as crazier things are,
[1:58:21.800 --> 1:58:24.080]  I wanna keep working into the future.
[1:58:24.080 --> 1:58:26.920]  But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[1:58:26.920 --> 1:58:29.400]  So please, I hope God works through you
[1:58:29.400 --> 1:58:32.320]  and puts a message in your heart to support us.
[1:58:32.320 --> 1:58:34.480]  But again, that's up to you and your relationship with God.
[1:58:34.480 --> 1:58:37.120]  I just wanna thank you all for the years of support
[1:58:37.120 --> 1:58:38.880]  you've given us and what you've done.
[1:58:38.880 --> 1:58:40.600]  And just ask you again to pray to God
[1:58:40.600 --> 1:58:43.000]  and ask what God's vision is for you.
[1:58:43.000 --> 1:58:44.440]  And hopefully God will touch your heart
[1:58:44.440 --> 1:58:45.960]  to continue to support him for worse.
[1:58:45.960 --> 1:58:46.800]  God bless.
[1:58:46.800 --> 1:58:49.840]  Lady Bianca and Captain Ken TakeChild
[1:58:50.080 --> 1:58:51.640]  What are champions made of?
[1:58:53.440 --> 1:58:55.000]  Here's a man who can show you.
[1:58:54.520 --> 1:58:55.800]  Damn!
[1:59:55.800 --> 2:00:07.320]  Welcome back into hour number three in the last segment of this hour.
[2:00:07.320 --> 2:00:12.760]  Project Veritas is going to join us with exclusive details of DHS insider blows whistle on global
[2:00:12.760 --> 2:00:17.120]  child sex trafficking cartels exploiting immigration loophole.
[2:00:17.120 --> 2:00:19.000]  This is big.
[2:00:19.000 --> 2:00:23.000]  And then we have another special guest coming up in the fourth hour, but Dr. Lee Merritt,
[2:00:23.000 --> 2:00:26.240]  this is a short segment, long segment coming up that you're going to leave us.
[2:00:26.240 --> 2:00:27.960]  We really appreciate your time.
[2:00:27.960 --> 2:00:32.080]  Please continue to impart your great knowledge on folks.
[2:00:32.080 --> 2:00:35.200]  Well, I guess in the short segment, I'm going to say to people, you know, there's kind of
[2:00:35.200 --> 2:00:36.960]  three phases here to take our world back.
[2:00:36.960 --> 2:00:40.320]  The first one is you have to take safety for your own family.
[2:00:40.320 --> 2:00:41.840]  And I want to talk a little about that.
[2:00:41.840 --> 2:00:46.400]  And then the next thing is how to how to prepare for the future.
[2:00:46.400 --> 2:00:51.160]  And then the last and how to deal with the mandates, because I get calls on that all
[2:00:51.160 --> 2:00:53.880]  the time on the mandates.
[2:00:53.880 --> 2:00:57.200]  And then we can finish up with how to take the world back, I guess.
[2:00:57.200 --> 2:01:00.880]  But the first thing is you have to figure out when you look at who you're going to trust.
[2:01:00.880 --> 2:01:06.840]  Again, don't trust the government officials and the hospital official statements, keeping
[2:01:06.840 --> 2:01:12.080]  in mind hospitals and their senior staff and people, I mean, they're taking blood money
[2:01:12.080 --> 2:01:14.000]  to tell you these things.
[2:01:14.000 --> 2:01:19.080]  They're taking money from Dr. Fauci that prohibits them from talking to you about things that
[2:01:19.080 --> 2:01:20.440]  really could save your life.
[2:01:20.440 --> 2:01:22.160]  Here's a really simple one.
[2:01:22.160 --> 2:01:25.880]  Why after all the billions of dollars we gave the CDC, did they not tell you to take vitamin
[2:01:25.880 --> 2:01:26.880]  D?
[2:01:26.880 --> 2:01:28.320]  You know, Alex, you got it in the shop.
[2:01:28.320 --> 2:01:30.960]  This is, you know, it's so, it's so simple.
[2:01:30.960 --> 2:01:32.280]  It's not expensive.
[2:01:32.280 --> 2:01:35.720]  But the biggest, the Indonesians looked at this and they realized the biggest risk to
[2:01:35.720 --> 2:01:39.760]  ending up in the ICU or dead is having a vitamin D level below 30.
[2:01:39.760 --> 2:01:42.480]  And I'm just going to tell you, the sun doesn't do that for you.
[2:01:42.480 --> 2:01:44.040]  I lived in the sunniest city in America.
[2:01:44.040 --> 2:01:45.200]  I tested people all the time.
[2:01:45.200 --> 2:01:49.480]  They were in the 20s playing golf, you know, so you need to take a D supplement.
[2:01:49.480 --> 2:01:53.880]  If you don't do anything else, I have a list of several literally like six things I think
[2:01:53.880 --> 2:01:55.960]  you need to take, maybe seven.
[2:01:55.960 --> 2:01:58.720]  And we're learning more and more all the time, but, but simple things.
[2:01:58.720 --> 2:01:59.720]  These are not expensive.
[2:01:59.720 --> 2:02:00.720]  So where's our government?
[2:02:00.720 --> 2:02:01.720]  Where are the big guys?
[2:02:01.720 --> 2:02:03.600]  Where are the university boys telling us this?
[2:02:03.600 --> 2:02:04.600]  They're not.
[2:02:04.600 --> 2:02:05.600]  And you need to do that.
[2:02:05.600 --> 2:02:06.600]  You need to do that.
[2:02:06.600 --> 2:02:10.560]  In fact, they attacked people that promoted that and vitamin C and zinc showing that again,
[2:02:10.560 --> 2:02:13.240]  big pharma wanted us sick.
[2:02:13.240 --> 2:02:14.240]  That's right.
[2:02:14.240 --> 2:02:15.240]  That's right.
[2:02:15.240 --> 2:02:17.480]  That's why I say I'm not suicidal either.
[2:02:17.480 --> 2:02:21.680]  You know, and then the other thing is ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine, there is just no question
[2:02:21.680 --> 2:02:22.680]  they work.
[2:02:22.680 --> 2:02:25.600]  Now, if you're sick, you need to be treated early.
[2:02:25.600 --> 2:02:29.920]  And I'm going to tell you, even if you go to a doctor that cares and that knows about
[2:02:29.920 --> 2:02:35.760]  the protocols and writes for you for ivermectin, pharmacies may be out.
[2:02:35.760 --> 2:02:37.080]  There's a shortage of everything.
[2:02:37.080 --> 2:02:40.040]  And the price has gone up considerably, considerably.
[2:02:40.040 --> 2:02:44.880]  I mean, for 120 tablets now, the ivermectin, you'll pay $500 if you don't have insurance.
[2:02:44.880 --> 2:02:46.520]  So a lot of people can't afford that.
[2:02:46.520 --> 2:02:48.840]  So there are ways of getting these things offline.
[2:02:48.840 --> 2:02:52.240]  You don't have to see a doctor to get them over the internet.
[2:02:52.240 --> 2:02:55.960]  People that worry about getting drugs from overseas, I point out that the Chinese have
[2:02:55.960 --> 2:03:01.480]  been supplying our pharmaceuticals over 90% of them for the last decade.
[2:03:01.480 --> 2:03:04.840]  So anyway, your drugs are coming from China.
[2:03:04.840 --> 2:03:05.840]  Yeah.
[2:03:05.840 --> 2:03:07.440]  So why turn your nose up at Mexico?
[2:03:07.440 --> 2:03:08.440]  Yeah.
[2:03:08.440 --> 2:03:09.440]  Or India.
[2:03:09.440 --> 2:03:15.520]  You know, I was in India and I went to a dirt floor pharmacy and got stuff that was wrapped
[2:03:15.520 --> 2:03:16.520]  by Searle.
[2:03:16.520 --> 2:03:17.520]  I mean, come on.
[2:03:17.520 --> 2:03:18.720]  So it works.
[2:03:18.720 --> 2:03:25.200]  And so let me just mention about one quick thing on mandates because their kids are going
[2:03:25.200 --> 2:03:28.800]  back to the schools and they're masked and all that sort of stuff.
[2:03:28.800 --> 2:03:30.720]  Nobody can give you a little hall pass.
[2:03:30.720 --> 2:03:32.360]  Your doctor can't do it.
[2:03:32.360 --> 2:03:38.920]  If you ask your doctor for a vaccine certificate or a vaccine pass or a mask, what it's going
[2:03:38.920 --> 2:03:44.600]  to do is put your doctor on the ridgeline to the medical board in his state or her state.
[2:03:44.600 --> 2:03:48.120]  So don't expect, there are only five, Dr. McCulloch just said this the other day, that
[2:03:48.120 --> 2:03:52.600]  he thinks there are about 500 doctors trying to stand up against this whole tsunami.
[2:03:52.600 --> 2:03:55.880]  It is time to realize people that we are at war.
[2:03:55.880 --> 2:03:56.880]  It's not a virus.
[2:03:56.880 --> 2:03:57.880]  They're coming after you.
[2:03:57.880 --> 2:03:59.480]  They're coming after your children.
[2:03:59.480 --> 2:04:03.800]  And when it comes to mask mandates in the school, they don't care about your children.
[2:04:03.800 --> 2:04:06.560]  They don't care about education of your children.
[2:04:06.560 --> 2:04:09.440]  They care about the money of your child sitting in that seat.
[2:04:09.440 --> 2:04:10.880]  That's the only thing they care about.
[2:04:10.880 --> 2:04:15.800]  I would recommend that you just get with your friends, get all together and go down and put
[2:04:15.800 --> 2:04:19.400]  down your home schooling paperwork.
[2:04:19.400 --> 2:04:23.920]  The collectivists among the school people would probably have a real hissy fit if 20,
[2:04:23.920 --> 2:04:26.480]  30 people suddenly pulled their kids out of school.
[2:04:26.480 --> 2:04:28.480]  That's a lot of money to the school district.
[2:04:28.480 --> 2:04:30.320]  That's the kind of action that's going to make a difference.
[2:04:30.320 --> 2:04:31.800]  All right, Dr. McCulloch, we're back in 60 seconds.
[2:04:31.800 --> 2:04:32.800]  You're on fire.
[2:04:32.800 --> 2:04:37.320]  I want to get back into action and back into what you're saying and back in how we stand
[2:04:37.320 --> 2:04:38.320]  up against this.
[2:04:38.320 --> 2:04:43.000]  You just said there's a lot of great material on your site, TheMedicalRebel.com.
[2:04:43.000 --> 2:04:44.160]  That is scary.
[2:04:44.160 --> 2:04:48.560]  It is about 500 doctors who are following the Hippocratic Health and Common Sense standing
[2:04:48.560 --> 2:04:52.080]  up against this whole thing who've been sensor-detected, demonized.
[2:04:52.080 --> 2:04:56.080]  We've got to boost and support every single one of you, like our lives, depend on it because
[2:04:56.080 --> 2:04:58.600]  they do.
[2:04:58.600 --> 2:05:02.320]  Not all vitamin and mineral supplements are equal.
[2:05:02.320 --> 2:05:03.320]  Many of them are synthetic.
[2:05:03.320 --> 2:05:05.360]  Many of them have fillers and additives.
[2:05:05.360 --> 2:05:09.600]  Many of them just pass right through the body and are not absorbed, but that's not the case
[2:05:09.600 --> 2:05:14.040]  with our incredibly popular, because it's so effective product that it's now been sold
[2:05:14.040 --> 2:05:17.360]  out for months, but it's finally back in stone.
[2:05:17.360 --> 2:05:19.760]  That is vitamin, mineral fusion.
[2:05:19.760 --> 2:05:24.040]  All the essential vitamins, all the essential minerals, a bunch of key amino acids to help
[2:05:24.040 --> 2:05:26.840]  it upload better into your body and your cells.
[2:05:26.840 --> 2:05:27.840]  It's in powder form.
[2:05:27.840 --> 2:05:28.840]  It's great for children.
[2:05:28.840 --> 2:05:29.840]  It's great for adults.
[2:05:29.840 --> 2:05:33.840]  It's really important for folks that are older because they don't absorb as well through
[2:05:33.840 --> 2:05:34.840]  their guts.
[2:05:34.840 --> 2:05:36.840]  This liquid formula really, really does it.
[2:05:36.840 --> 2:05:41.360]  You mix up a picture of it every couple days, put it in the refrigerator, keep it out in
[2:05:41.360 --> 2:05:44.560]  the kitchen, and just remember to drink it in the morning and in the evening.
[2:05:44.560 --> 2:05:45.560]  It tastes great.
[2:05:45.560 --> 2:05:46.560]  It makes your body healthy.
[2:05:46.560 --> 2:05:50.760]  It boosts your immune system, and it funds the end full war.
[2:05:50.760 --> 2:05:55.400]  A true 360 win, so vitamin, mineral fusion sold out for months is back in stock for a
[2:05:55.400 --> 2:06:00.840]  limited time, 33% off in FullWareStore.com.
[2:06:00.840 --> 2:06:06.440]  The Alex Jones Show, because there is a war on for your mind.
[2:06:06.440 --> 2:06:12.800]  Well, another impressive soul, a great lady, a great patriot, and as she said, she's been
[2:06:12.800 --> 2:06:17.320]  trained to be a medical doctor since she was four years old, with her daddy who was a doctor
[2:06:17.320 --> 2:06:19.600]  going around seeing his patients.
[2:06:19.600 --> 2:06:23.840]  You know, I saw a group becoming a large animal vet, never got a degree in it, was working
[2:06:23.840 --> 2:06:27.520]  on the ranch, four or five, six years old, going around and working on cows and horses.
[2:06:27.520 --> 2:06:31.600]  That's how you get the real knowledge, and here she is all those years later, exposing
[2:06:31.600 --> 2:06:32.600]  this great tyranny.
[2:06:32.600 --> 2:06:34.400]  So, Doc, you've been on a roll.
[2:06:34.400 --> 2:06:35.400]  Please continue.
[2:06:35.400 --> 2:06:41.080]  Well, the next thing people need to know is, and I usually never in my whole life did
[2:06:41.080 --> 2:06:44.000]  I tell people, don't do a treatment or don't do a vaccine.
[2:06:44.000 --> 2:06:47.600]  I used to say, look, you need to educate yourself and make your own decision.
[2:06:47.600 --> 2:06:49.600]  This is what I know about it, blah, blah, blah.
[2:06:49.600 --> 2:06:53.080]  But now I'm going to just tell you, I believe the vaccine is part of the bio weapon or the
[2:06:53.080 --> 2:06:55.000]  big bio weapon right now.
[2:06:55.000 --> 2:06:57.040]  And we don't know the long term consequences.
[2:06:57.040 --> 2:07:02.000]  I can tell you we are seeing cancers break out, and that's because they dumb down urinate
[2:07:02.000 --> 2:07:03.080]  immune system.
[2:07:03.080 --> 2:07:04.840]  How crazy is it to do this?
[2:07:04.840 --> 2:07:10.080]  You've had COVID, you're immune, you take the vaccine, and it now takes away all that
[2:07:10.080 --> 2:07:15.600]  immunity to this God-given natural great immunity to COVID, or to the SARS-CoV-2, whatever you
[2:07:15.600 --> 2:07:20.400]  want to call it, and gives you this little synthetic immunity that might give you a problem
[2:07:20.400 --> 2:07:26.640]  later and certainly is giving you a problem now as we see with clots and cancers and myocarditis
[2:07:26.640 --> 2:07:28.160]  and all the stuff that's happening.
[2:07:28.160 --> 2:07:29.960]  So don't take the vaccine.
[2:07:29.960 --> 2:07:33.560]  If you did take the vaccine, we're trying to ameliorate the problems.
[2:07:33.560 --> 2:07:37.480]  I've got a thing on my side about what to do if you have vaccine remorse.
[2:07:37.480 --> 2:07:39.160]  I think we're going to get better at this.
[2:07:39.160 --> 2:07:46.320]  I don't think it's the kiss of death that Luke Montagnier said, and he was misquoted,
[2:07:46.320 --> 2:07:47.320]  by the way.
[2:07:47.320 --> 2:07:51.640]  What he really said is if you take this vaccine and then you wear a mask, you might be dead
[2:07:51.640 --> 2:07:52.760]  in a couple of years.
[2:07:52.760 --> 2:07:57.000]  Or if you get another vaccine, you may be dead in a couple of years because they're additive,
[2:07:57.000 --> 2:07:58.640]  they're super additive.
[2:07:58.640 --> 2:08:03.280]  So don't take the vaccine, and I think here's, we started with a military, and I just want
[2:08:03.280 --> 2:08:05.840]  to say this one point quickly about that.
[2:08:05.840 --> 2:08:10.280]  One of the saddest vaccine stories in the military was the anthrax vaccine that gave
[2:08:10.280 --> 2:08:15.240]  people, it was one batch of the anthrax vaccine, no question, had squalene as an adjuvant,
[2:08:15.240 --> 2:08:19.640]  pushed through an emergency use for the Gulf War, and that's what gave these guys Gulf
[2:08:19.640 --> 2:08:20.640]  War syndrome.
[2:08:20.640 --> 2:08:26.280]  Now, one of my great friends and neighbors works in the VA.
[2:08:26.280 --> 2:08:31.440]  He took the vaccine years ago that gave people Gulf War syndrome, and it had squalene in
[2:08:31.440 --> 2:08:32.440]  it.
[2:08:32.440 --> 2:08:36.920]  But fortunately, he hasn't been damaged yet that we know of, but he gets a letter from
[2:08:36.920 --> 2:08:42.400]  the VA saying, make sure if you have any neurologic signs and symptoms, you remember that you're
[2:08:42.400 --> 2:08:47.120]  at risk of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or Lou Gehrig's disease, fatal neurologic disease
[2:08:47.120 --> 2:08:49.560]  at four times the baseline rate.
[2:08:49.560 --> 2:08:52.800]  And they remind him of that, that he can come and get free care in the VA, well, he works
[2:08:52.800 --> 2:08:53.800]  in the VA.
[2:08:53.800 --> 2:08:54.800]  But what did they do?
[2:08:54.800 --> 2:09:00.000]  They just forced him to get vaccinated with a vaccine that also has squalene in it.
[2:09:00.000 --> 2:09:05.080]  I say that because it tells you the psychopaths that are running this.
[2:09:05.080 --> 2:09:10.600]  They put squalene back in flu ad in 2017 after they knew it caused the Gulf War syndrome.
[2:09:10.600 --> 2:09:16.640]  So to keep that in mind, when you want to trust these guys, I give a talk and some little
[2:09:16.640 --> 2:09:19.640]  old lady will come up, little old lady being a couple years older than me, will come up
[2:09:19.640 --> 2:09:21.760]  and say, well, what about the shingles vaccine?
[2:09:21.760 --> 2:09:26.080]  And I say, listen, you heard what I just said about what's been going on.
[2:09:26.080 --> 2:09:27.520]  I don't even trust my toothpaste.
[2:09:27.520 --> 2:09:30.360]  How are you going to take another vaccine?
[2:09:30.360 --> 2:09:32.160]  The other thing is don't wear a mask.
[2:09:32.160 --> 2:09:34.080]  I'm going to tell you, I don't care what they do.
[2:09:34.080 --> 2:09:38.720]  I mean, they're talking about a $600 fine in Omaha or six months in jail.
[2:09:38.720 --> 2:09:42.040]  I think I'm going to go down and look at the Douglas County jail and see what it looks
[2:09:42.040 --> 2:09:43.040]  like.
[2:09:43.040 --> 2:09:46.680]  You know, the masks are evil.
[2:09:46.680 --> 2:09:47.920]  They're just pure evil.
[2:09:47.920 --> 2:09:54.560]  In fact, this is, I came, I ended up on your band dot video when I gave my mask lecture
[2:09:54.560 --> 2:09:57.160]  for AFLDS, the America's Frontline Doctors.
[2:09:57.160 --> 2:09:58.160]  Why?
[2:09:58.160 --> 2:09:59.680]  Why are masks so important?
[2:09:59.680 --> 2:10:06.920]  Because they are the psychological underpinning of the Psiop of this terrible event.
[2:10:06.920 --> 2:10:11.120]  When people put a mask on, it's a symbol of obedience, transformation.
[2:10:11.120 --> 2:10:12.240]  It's a slave mask.
[2:10:12.240 --> 2:10:15.400]  It says, I'm going to obey you and do all this crazy stuff.
[2:10:15.400 --> 2:10:16.400]  Yeah.
[2:10:16.400 --> 2:10:21.080]  And so now if you, if people take them off and they go, hey, nothing happened to me.
[2:10:21.080 --> 2:10:25.960]  Hey, that was just all that crazy Dr. Fauci, the disinformation guy telling me to do this.
[2:10:25.960 --> 2:10:29.600]  If I'm, nothing's happening out here, life's going on.
[2:10:29.600 --> 2:10:34.040]  That would be a problem for them because you have to keep it going.
[2:10:34.040 --> 2:10:36.040]  They want to keep their, their control going.
[2:10:36.040 --> 2:10:37.880]  They're going to try and remask us.
[2:10:37.880 --> 2:10:41.080]  And if you really look, I got to tell you something right here at Travis County, they're
[2:10:41.080 --> 2:10:44.360]  trying to order all the school children to do it despite the fact that governor blocked
[2:10:44.360 --> 2:10:45.360]  it.
[2:10:45.360 --> 2:10:51.000]  Well, and despite the fact that we have the, the, the WikiLeaks of Fauci's emails that
[2:10:51.000 --> 2:10:52.880]  tells, he knows it didn't work.
[2:10:52.880 --> 2:10:56.960]  We have, we have, you know, decades of history and science that show it didn't work.
[2:10:56.960 --> 2:11:00.640]  The only science that purports to show it works happened after the outbreak.
[2:11:00.640 --> 2:11:07.800]  And here's, and here's the big one is that these masks, I mean, the, the actual medical
[2:11:07.800 --> 2:11:09.320]  literature, I think it was in JAMA.
[2:11:09.320 --> 2:11:12.560]  I mean, I don't, I don't remember if it was JAMA or New England Journal of Medicine in
[2:11:12.560 --> 2:11:16.600]  the midst of this, after Fauci kept changing his mind about whether medical people needed
[2:11:16.600 --> 2:11:17.600]  it.
[2:11:17.600 --> 2:11:19.080]  No, they don't, they need it, but you don't need it.
[2:11:19.080 --> 2:11:20.080]  Then you needed it.
[2:11:20.080 --> 2:11:22.560]  Then you couldn't, oh, it was just to keep your hand off your face.
[2:11:22.560 --> 2:11:23.560]  I love that one.
[2:11:23.560 --> 2:11:24.560]  Okay.
[2:11:24.560 --> 2:11:26.080]  I'm going to be mandated to keep my hand off my face.
[2:11:26.080 --> 2:11:27.600]  It's just a simple mass mental illness.
[2:11:27.600 --> 2:11:31.080]  Doc, let me shift gears here because you raised the point that I meant to ask you about when
[2:11:31.080 --> 2:11:33.440]  I wanted to get you on weeks ago.
[2:11:33.440 --> 2:11:39.280]  And that is, I see New York Times, Washington Post, eight months ago when the so-called
[2:11:39.280 --> 2:11:45.680]  injections began, the vaccines began, the gene, the gene therapies, they would say it's
[2:11:45.680 --> 2:11:50.280]  going to make your lymph nodes swell up and it might make a uterus swell up or your breasts,
[2:11:50.280 --> 2:11:53.680]  but doctors, if it looks like a tumor, just don't worry about it.
[2:11:53.680 --> 2:11:58.560]  Well, then Roger Stone's wife takes the second Pfizer shot.
[2:11:58.560 --> 2:12:03.440]  They tell her she has lymphoma, non-Hobskins, right in the lymph node where it happened,
[2:12:03.440 --> 2:12:04.440]  stage four.
[2:12:04.440 --> 2:12:08.480]  I know a bunch of other people, the phones load up when I open the phones.
[2:12:08.480 --> 2:12:12.160]  I see it in the news where women are 35, 40 years old and they've had a problem.
[2:12:12.160 --> 2:12:13.640]  Now they're menstrual cycles all the time.
[2:12:13.640 --> 2:12:14.640]  They have hysterectomies.
[2:12:14.640 --> 2:12:16.440]  Now they're being told they have cancer.
[2:12:16.440 --> 2:12:20.480]  So they said, oh, don't worry about the false cancer.
[2:12:20.480 --> 2:12:21.480]  It's a false alarm.
[2:12:21.480 --> 2:12:24.400]  But when they see their doctor, they say, no, that's cancer.
[2:12:24.400 --> 2:12:26.080]  So this is dramatic.
[2:12:26.080 --> 2:12:28.040]  Well, what's going on there?
[2:12:28.040 --> 2:12:31.720]  Well, again, they dumbed down our immune system.
[2:12:31.720 --> 2:12:33.480]  What do you have your immune system for?
[2:12:33.480 --> 2:12:39.160]  You have your immune system for not just infectious diseases, but to keep the virus and the cancer
[2:12:39.160 --> 2:12:41.360]  genes in check that we all have in our DNA.
[2:12:41.360 --> 2:12:44.520]  So the killer T's are going on eating cancer all day.
[2:12:44.520 --> 2:12:48.760]  And when you take the vaccine, they admit it lowers it by one third at least, the Pfizer.
[2:12:48.760 --> 2:12:50.840]  And so you don't have the troops on call.
[2:12:50.840 --> 2:12:54.400]  So if you almost had cancer in a breast or almost had cancer in a lymph node, I guess
[2:12:54.400 --> 2:12:55.400]  that it happens.
[2:12:55.400 --> 2:13:01.680]  Well, it actually allows, yeah, it's not specific, I think, but it allows cancer genes to be
[2:13:01.680 --> 2:13:06.520]  expressed because you've lost the ability to methylate, which is a chemical process.
[2:13:06.520 --> 2:13:10.840]  You can help it by taking betaine or dimethylglycine or things that we can talk about.
[2:13:10.840 --> 2:13:15.880]  But the point is it stops this process of stabilizing that DNA segment for the cancer.
[2:13:15.880 --> 2:13:18.600]  So these things are coming out.
[2:13:18.600 --> 2:13:23.920]  And that's what the informed consent, if we'd gotten real informed consent, informed
[2:13:23.920 --> 2:13:26.040]  consent in their mind is, roll up your sleeve.
[2:13:26.040 --> 2:13:30.080]  Oh, you might have a little itching or swelling or people got told this might turn your immune
[2:13:30.080 --> 2:13:31.720]  system off and give you cancer.
[2:13:31.720 --> 2:13:35.240]  They wouldn't do it, but they don't tell them that they wouldn't be doing it.
[2:13:35.240 --> 2:13:36.240]  That's right.
[2:13:36.240 --> 2:13:41.880]  And if you remember, if you go back in history and I studied this extensively, the, you know,
[2:13:41.880 --> 2:13:46.560]  the, there were seven Nazi physicians that were, that were killed up, were hung for crimes
[2:13:46.560 --> 2:13:48.800]  against humanity mass murder.
[2:13:48.800 --> 2:13:53.120]  Most of them, I think almost all except with least one, didn't commit murder themselves
[2:13:53.120 --> 2:13:54.280]  at all.
[2:13:54.280 --> 2:13:59.360]  What they did was they allowed a system to be in place that allowed coercion for people
[2:13:59.360 --> 2:14:00.360]  to be in experiments.
[2:14:00.360 --> 2:14:05.160]  In other words, the prisoners, and they did not apply informed consent.
[2:14:05.160 --> 2:14:07.320]  What does that sound like today?
[2:14:07.320 --> 2:14:08.600]  We are coercing people.
[2:14:08.600 --> 2:14:12.800]  You can't draw, you can't shop in this place or you can't go to, but first it was little
[2:14:12.800 --> 2:14:14.640]  stuff like you couldn't go to the zoo.
[2:14:14.640 --> 2:14:16.900]  But now they're saying you won't be able to buy groceries.
[2:14:16.900 --> 2:14:19.120]  You won't be able to travel on airplanes.
[2:14:19.120 --> 2:14:23.840]  This is absolute coercion, Nuremberg violation one on one.
[2:14:23.840 --> 2:14:24.840]  Yeah.
[2:14:24.840 --> 2:14:28.840]  And so, you know, so that's why you need to not accede to this.
[2:14:28.840 --> 2:14:33.600]  And by the way, if people, you know, now it's at the, the, you know, cut time here on the
[2:14:33.600 --> 2:14:37.840]  military apparently, but the problem is what are they, if they take this one, it won't
[2:14:37.840 --> 2:14:38.840]  be over.
[2:14:38.840 --> 2:14:41.840]  Anybody that accedes to this thinking, okay, I know it doesn't make a lot of sense.
[2:14:41.840 --> 2:14:44.440]  Well, they're already saying in Israel, oh, the two shots is enough.
[2:14:44.440 --> 2:14:48.160]  Now you must have the third and now they're talking about a fourth and Trudeau up in Canada
[2:14:48.160 --> 2:14:51.240]  already bought like five years out.
[2:14:51.240 --> 2:14:57.160]  So whether it's masks or whether it's the vaccine or whether it's, you know, stupid
[2:14:57.160 --> 2:14:58.160]  antisocial distance.
[2:14:58.160 --> 2:14:59.680]  I don't care what you pick.
[2:14:59.680 --> 2:15:04.160]  These are nonsense things that are put in place to, to as part of being a chart of coercion
[2:15:04.160 --> 2:15:05.160]  by the way.
[2:15:05.160 --> 2:15:06.160]  Let me ask you this.
[2:15:06.160 --> 2:15:07.160]  You've been gracious to say this long.
[2:15:07.160 --> 2:15:11.160]  Do one more segment until 30 after, I want you to talk about detoxing because you just
[2:15:11.160 --> 2:15:15.040]  brought up people that have taken the, the, the Franken shots from your research, what
[2:15:15.040 --> 2:15:19.280]  might be good or what physicians they could contact or any ideas you have about the toxin
[2:15:19.280 --> 2:15:22.360]  or what people should do to protect themselves and any of the other points.
[2:15:22.360 --> 2:15:23.360]  You're amazing.
[2:15:23.360 --> 2:15:26.480]  The medical rebel.com Dr. Lee Marin, she's a real champion.
[2:15:26.480 --> 2:15:27.480]  We love her.
[2:15:27.480 --> 2:15:28.480]  We appreciate her.
[2:15:28.480 --> 2:15:29.640]  And she's going to do one more segment with us.
[2:15:29.640 --> 2:15:30.640]  Is that okay doc?
[2:15:30.640 --> 2:15:31.640]  Yeah, sure.
[2:15:31.640 --> 2:15:32.640]  Thanks for having me.
[2:15:32.640 --> 2:15:33.640]  Fantastic.
[2:15:33.640 --> 2:15:34.640]  All right.
[2:15:34.640 --> 2:15:35.640]  It's great to have her.
[2:15:35.640 --> 2:15:36.640]  I am so excited.
[2:15:36.640 --> 2:15:37.640]  And then the last segment of this hour, Project Veritas.
[2:15:37.640 --> 2:15:41.280]  I'm not sure if it's okay for who's joining us, but one of us joining us with other details
[2:15:41.280 --> 2:15:46.920]  of this breaking news, DHS insider blows whistle on global child sex trafficking cartels exploiting
[2:15:46.920 --> 2:15:51.280]  immigration loophole, which we've now learned Hillary's involved in evacuating Afghans just
[2:15:51.280 --> 2:15:53.280]  like she was in Haiti.
[2:15:53.280 --> 2:15:54.280]  Yeah.
[2:15:54.280 --> 2:15:55.280]  This woman's evil.
[2:15:55.280 --> 2:15:56.280]  We'll be right back.
[2:15:56.280 --> 2:16:01.480]  Hey everybody, confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture?
[2:16:01.480 --> 2:16:02.480]  Me too.
[2:16:02.480 --> 2:16:06.640]  But listen, after all the research, all the conflicting studies, after all the squabbling,
[2:16:06.640 --> 2:16:09.360]  there's one thing almost everyone agrees on.
[2:16:09.360 --> 2:16:13.760]  It's that immune system health can literally be the difference between life and death.
[2:16:13.760 --> 2:16:15.480]  You probably already believe that.
[2:16:15.480 --> 2:16:16.680]  I certainly do.
[2:16:16.680 --> 2:16:17.680]  So here's the thing.
[2:16:17.680 --> 2:16:22.040]  I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant based substances actually
[2:16:22.040 --> 2:16:26.120]  have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.
[2:16:26.120 --> 2:16:31.920]  Now, you'll have to sign a waiver, but you can check out what I've discovered at strongerdefence.com.
[2:16:31.920 --> 2:16:33.440]  No cures or treatments there.
[2:16:33.440 --> 2:16:38.440]  Instead, little known but shocking immune system research and a breakthrough immune support
[2:16:38.440 --> 2:16:42.480]  product based on that research called Immune 10x.
[2:16:42.480 --> 2:16:46.440]  In the best part, you can go to the Stronger Defense website right now and claim your own

[2:17:06.960 --> 2:17:09.560]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[2:17:09.560 --> 2:17:11.060]  They know you're angry.
[2:17:11.060 --> 2:17:15.360]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool
[2:17:15.360 --> 2:17:16.360]  we've got.

[2:18:01.000 --> 2:18:03.240]  haven't tried TurboForce, you need to try it.
[2:18:03.240 --> 2:18:06.160]  I've tried TurboForce with everything.
[2:18:06.160 --> 2:18:09.480]  Sometimes, you know, I went a little bit crazy, I put TurboForce in my coffee.
[2:18:09.480 --> 2:18:10.480]  That was a crazy week.
[2:18:10.480 --> 2:18:14.160]  I don't remember sleeping, but as far as the products go, TurboForce is my favorite.
[2:18:14.160 --> 2:18:17.440]  And all the Infowars products are down to taking control of your life, taking control
[2:18:17.440 --> 2:18:22.280]  of your health, not relying on other people to do it for you.
[2:18:22.280 --> 2:18:26.480]  Nobody wakes up in the morning and thinks, I'm going to give that person over there a
[2:18:26.480 --> 2:18:27.480]  better life.
[2:18:27.480 --> 2:18:28.480]  I'm going to wake up today.
[2:18:28.480 --> 2:18:29.480]  You know what?
[2:18:29.480 --> 2:18:32.280]  I'm going to spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there healthier, happier
[2:18:32.280 --> 2:18:33.280]  and richer.
[2:18:33.280 --> 2:18:35.000]  I'm going to make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend.
[2:18:35.000 --> 2:18:36.640]  I don't think that happens very often.
[2:18:36.640 --> 2:18:37.640]  It's never happened to me.
[2:18:37.640 --> 2:18:40.360]  I've never had anyone knock on my door and say, Tate, you're such a good guy.
[2:18:40.360 --> 2:18:42.120]  How can I improve your life in every single way?
[2:18:42.120 --> 2:18:44.800]  There's only one person who woke up and thought that, and that was me.
[2:18:44.800 --> 2:18:46.360]  I woke up and thought, you know what?
[2:18:46.360 --> 2:18:47.800]  Okay, I want to take control of my life.
[2:18:47.800 --> 2:18:50.640]  I want to take control of my health, and that's why you need to go to Infowars.com.
[2:18:50.640 --> 2:18:53.080]  Take control of your health right now and support the resistance.
[2:18:53.080 --> 2:18:54.240]  Don't buy into the group thing.
[2:18:54.240 --> 2:18:55.240]  Don't drink the Kool-Aid.
[2:18:55.240 --> 2:18:56.240]  Drink the TurboForce.
[2:18:56.240 --> 2:18:58.760]  Kool-Aid's bad and the TurboForce is good.
[2:18:58.760 --> 2:19:03.600]  Kool-Aid is the main stakeholder on this planet, but the big corporations for a hundred
[2:19:03.600 --> 2:19:07.280]  years have told us that humans are bad and evil and a pest floats on the earth so that
[2:19:07.280 --> 2:19:11.680]  we begin to believe we're bad and we'll turn off our life force and let the eugenics-based
[2:19:11.680 --> 2:19:13.680]  globalists take control of the planet.
[2:19:13.680 --> 2:19:19.080]  If you let a clown swab the head of the Davis Group's own Wikipedia page, he brags on there
[2:19:19.080 --> 2:19:24.200]  about how they're capturing democracy and taking over governments worldwide to set up
[2:19:24.200 --> 2:19:26.440]  corporate dictatorship under the UN.
[2:19:26.440 --> 2:19:28.720]  They admit all of this.
[2:19:28.720 --> 2:19:34.080]  They plan the lockdowns, they release the viruses, they think you're stupid, and their plan is
[2:19:34.080 --> 2:19:39.000]  to slowly cut off the resources so they can dictate total social control over you and
[2:19:39.000 --> 2:19:40.000]  your lives.
[2:19:40.000 --> 2:19:45.280]  That's how I was able to predict everything they did decades before they executed it,
[2:19:45.280 --> 2:19:50.680]  word for word with total precision, because they have a detailed battle plan.
[2:19:50.680 --> 2:19:55.400]  We cover it live weekdays, 11am to 3pm at Infowars.com for a slice show.
[2:19:55.400 --> 2:20:01.000]  Tell everybody to tune in now and war the world.
[2:20:01.000 --> 2:20:12.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:20:12.200 --> 2:20:16.680]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, ton of news next segment in Project Veritas.
[2:20:16.680 --> 2:20:22.240]  Dr. Lee Merritt is amazing in the interviews I've seen, really great to join us today with
[2:20:22.240 --> 2:20:23.240]  so much time.
[2:20:23.240 --> 2:20:29.080]  I get asked questions at the grocery store, I get asked questions in email, on the street.
[2:20:29.080 --> 2:20:33.480]  Hey, I got forced to take the shot, I got really sick when I took it, most people say
[2:20:33.480 --> 2:20:37.000]  but what do I do to detox, and I'm like I'm not a medical doctor, I don't know, and I've
[2:20:37.000 --> 2:20:39.960]  tried to research it.
[2:20:39.960 --> 2:20:44.740]  So Dr. Merritt, you were getting that a little bit earlier, is there anything with these
[2:20:44.740 --> 2:20:48.480]  franken shots that you know from research people could do, if it's turning off your
[2:20:48.480 --> 2:20:53.640]  immune system as they admit it does, to try to turn your immune system back on?
[2:20:53.640 --> 2:20:59.000]  Right, and quite frankly, we're talking about the vaccine, but it could also imply to people
[2:20:59.000 --> 2:21:03.840]  that have been shed on, I had that experience, which gives you bleeding and menstrual irregularities
[2:21:03.840 --> 2:21:08.400]  and rashes and viral like syndrome, so there's the people that were vaccinated, the people
[2:21:08.400 --> 2:21:11.960]  that have been shed on, the people that got COVID, which also again, if it was created
[2:21:11.960 --> 2:21:16.800]  by this bio weaponized stuff, we don't know the long term on that either, completely.
[2:21:16.800 --> 2:21:20.880]  So some of this applies to all of that, but the first thing to do is, one of the reasons
[2:21:20.880 --> 2:21:27.000]  people die is they get these hyper inflammatory problems, and we know that people that have
[2:21:27.000 --> 2:21:31.800]  an underlying autoimmune disease where their inflammation baseline is elevated, seem to
[2:21:31.800 --> 2:21:34.280]  have more of a problem when they take the vaccine.
[2:21:34.280 --> 2:21:39.880]  So the anti-inflammatory, there are books out there like Dr. Davis book on wheat, it's
[2:21:39.880 --> 2:21:47.120]  called Wheat Belly, there are a bunch of different ones, Grain Brain by Pearl Mudder, but one
[2:21:47.120 --> 2:21:54.160]  of the point is, is to eat, Jack LaLaine used to say this, when, don't eat what man made,
[2:21:54.160 --> 2:21:57.880]  if man made it, don't eat it, eat what God made, in other words, it isn't the large
[2:21:57.880 --> 2:21:58.880]  of what's going on.
[2:21:58.880 --> 2:22:01.960]  That's what I've been hearing is people have been fasting actually, and not eating meat,
[2:22:01.960 --> 2:22:03.560]  and they're saying it's helping too.
[2:22:03.560 --> 2:22:08.880]  Right, well, I'm not opposed to meat, but I am opposed to artificial anything.
[2:22:08.880 --> 2:22:11.920]  Oh, listen, I'm a huge meat guy myself, I'm just saying that's something that's hard
[2:22:11.920 --> 2:22:14.960]  for the body to process, but I'm just telling you, what people have been saying has been
[2:22:14.960 --> 2:22:20.000]  working is, people that are pro meat, but they're just going to a very, very, very low
[2:22:20.000 --> 2:22:21.000]  raw diet.
[2:22:21.000 --> 2:22:25.440]  Right, and I think when you're sick, your body kind of tells you to do that.
[2:22:25.440 --> 2:22:26.760]  So that's one thing.
[2:22:26.760 --> 2:22:31.800]  The second thing is, and you know, it's important, there are supplements that everybody should
[2:22:31.800 --> 2:22:36.400]  take, like 50% of people that did a COVID, they found were zinc deficient, so I talked
[2:22:36.400 --> 2:22:41.200]  about vitamin D, there's zinc, there's selenium, vitamin C, you know, one of the things I
[2:22:41.200 --> 2:22:45.920]  do is just take some chewable vitamin C and put it by my desk, and just, you know, when
[2:22:45.920 --> 2:22:48.560]  it's when I'm at work, when I'm at work every hour, so I take one.
[2:22:48.560 --> 2:22:51.280]  So I get about four grams a day, it's probably good for your arteries.
[2:22:51.280 --> 2:22:52.280]  Well, what are your things true?
[2:22:52.280 --> 2:22:56.320]  I got a lot of supplements, but if I don't leave them on my desk, or on a lazy Susan at
[2:22:56.320 --> 2:22:59.640]  the dinner table, I don't take them, you've got to leave them out front.
[2:22:59.640 --> 2:23:01.840]  Yeah, that's my husband too.
[2:23:01.840 --> 2:23:05.800]  I mean, husbands are cute, everyone ought to rent one, and they don't tend to take their
[2:23:05.800 --> 2:23:06.800]  money.
[2:23:06.800 --> 2:23:09.760]  The other one's anacetylcystine.
[2:23:09.760 --> 2:23:13.800]  Anacetylcystine is specifically good, it's a great, it makes glutathione in the brain
[2:23:13.800 --> 2:23:16.800]  and things, it's a good thing to take anyway.
[2:23:16.800 --> 2:23:21.840]  But in this particular case, apparently, it helps block the attachment to the, or something,
[2:23:21.840 --> 2:23:27.760]  the interaction with the H2 pathway, where the spike protein hooks in.
[2:23:27.760 --> 2:23:31.920]  So NAC seems to help, especially some of the diarrhea stuff we're seeing.
[2:23:31.920 --> 2:23:35.480]  And then lysine, in the Dominican Republic, they just gave people lysine.
[2:23:35.480 --> 2:23:38.480]  Lysine's an old time, it's cheap, it's an amino acid.
[2:23:38.480 --> 2:23:43.160]  It's an old time treatment for like cold sores and things, to prevent cold sores, the dermatologists
[2:23:43.160 --> 2:23:45.000]  have used this for a long time.
[2:23:45.000 --> 2:23:48.760]  And they just, it's like two grams, two and a half grams a day, but the Dominican Republic
[2:23:48.760 --> 2:23:53.360]  used it and they prophylaxized it with it, and there are people with very low problem
[2:23:53.360 --> 2:23:54.840]  with COVID, so in the hospitals.
[2:23:54.840 --> 2:23:56.800]  I think that's a good one.
[2:23:56.800 --> 2:24:01.720]  Now one of the ones that we talked about for your particular situation where somebody's
[2:24:01.720 --> 2:24:06.280]  vaccinated and now they have vaccine remorse, and they're worried about this cancer thing,
[2:24:06.280 --> 2:24:08.880]  you need to have, you need to have a methyl donor.
[2:24:08.880 --> 2:24:11.960]  And the two big ones that I'm aware of, and maybe somebody can come up with a little better
[2:24:11.960 --> 2:24:18.160]  one, dimethylglycine or DMG, which I used to get in a powder form, but now the new stuff
[2:24:18.160 --> 2:24:21.040]  tastes horrible, so I just, I'd get in a capsule.
[2:24:21.040 --> 2:24:25.880]  And then the next one, betaine, which is trimethylglycine.
[2:24:25.880 --> 2:24:30.640]  And so I think take methyl donor a couple of times a day, it makes a lot of sense in
[2:24:30.640 --> 2:24:32.360]  this situation.
[2:24:32.360 --> 2:24:37.600]  The other thing, we don't know what else, look at the people, and I carry my day, and
[2:24:37.600 --> 2:24:45.480]  she's talking about the, what I want to say, the nanoparticles, the spions, the superparamagnetic
[2:24:45.480 --> 2:24:46.480]  iron oxides.
[2:24:46.480 --> 2:24:53.040]  I tested people in my office early on, and I found about 60% were magnetic to a paper
[2:24:53.040 --> 2:24:56.800]  clip, the positive paper clip test, and no, it wasn't just sticking on their sweat, and
[2:24:56.800 --> 2:25:00.440]  I did know how to do the exam.
[2:25:00.440 --> 2:25:02.040]  So there's that.
[2:25:02.040 --> 2:25:06.920]  And I think that we might consider things like ozonation, chelation, I mean, I haven't
[2:25:06.920 --> 2:25:11.280]  worked this all out, but ozonation for the graphene, that's the other thing we're finding
[2:25:11.280 --> 2:25:12.640]  in here, graphene.
[2:25:12.640 --> 2:25:16.080]  So the graphene, yeah, there you go.
[2:25:16.080 --> 2:25:17.240]  You know what's amazing is how-
[2:25:17.240 --> 2:25:18.240]  Let's talk about that.
[2:25:18.240 --> 2:25:19.240]  What are you things doing there?
[2:25:19.240 --> 2:25:22.600]  Is this some nano chain reaction?
[2:25:22.600 --> 2:25:27.520]  Well, I would follow Dr. Charles Lieber's work.
[2:25:27.520 --> 2:25:31.800]  Dr. Charles Lieber's the Harvard guy, chief of chemistry and biochemistry, who got arrested
[2:25:31.800 --> 2:25:36.040]  in February because he was working for the Chinese as well as for our department of defense,
[2:25:36.040 --> 2:25:37.040]  think DARPA.
[2:25:37.040 --> 2:25:41.440]  And he developed nanotechnology that was, that part of which is what they need for this
[2:25:41.440 --> 2:25:48.160]  vaccine, but to make that work, it's like nanos, silver and pregnant nanogels, I think.
[2:25:48.160 --> 2:25:51.040]  But he developed things like, it's called nanowire, but it's not a wire.
[2:25:51.040 --> 2:25:54.040]  It's made out of these gels and it can self-assemble in your body.
[2:25:54.040 --> 2:25:55.040]  We've got-
[2:25:55.040 --> 2:25:58.960]  Let's say you take a shot that he uses things in your own body to start replicating and
[2:25:58.960 --> 2:26:01.680]  especially turning you into a circuit.
[2:26:01.680 --> 2:26:07.880]  And this is what the Colonel Zhao and Wang said years ago about where the war was going
[2:26:07.880 --> 2:26:12.240]  to go with Chinese war planning, was going to be looking at the brain-electronic interface.
[2:26:12.240 --> 2:26:15.760]  And that's what Charles Lieber apparently gave them, but it's also applies to this.
[2:26:15.760 --> 2:26:19.520]  So I don't know what's in there, but we know that this is something that a lot of people
[2:26:19.520 --> 2:26:20.720]  have been working on.
[2:26:20.720 --> 2:26:26.680]  The brain, the neural, electronic interface, and in general, communicating, you know, you've
[2:26:26.680 --> 2:26:30.000]  heard of Internet of Things, well, they also talk about Internet of Bodies.
[2:26:30.000 --> 2:26:31.320]  Well, how do you do that?
[2:26:31.320 --> 2:26:32.640]  You've got to have a receiver in the body.
[2:26:32.640 --> 2:26:33.640]  Sure, exactly.
[2:26:33.640 --> 2:26:35.080]  So they're putting the plug in, this is what I've heard.
[2:26:35.080 --> 2:26:36.080]  That's what this-
[2:26:36.080 --> 2:26:37.080]  The big push-
[2:26:37.080 --> 2:26:42.160]  I mean, we've seen things that I don't, I'm not an electron microscopist and I can't
[2:26:42.160 --> 2:26:46.080]  verify this, but you know, the people in Spain saw the stuff they saw as graphing.
[2:26:46.080 --> 2:26:47.560]  They sound pretty legit.
[2:26:47.560 --> 2:26:53.040]  I know that other, you know, some doctors I know have looked at this under the microscope.
[2:26:53.040 --> 2:26:58.160]  They've put magnets on the, or they put paper clips on the jars and that some of the vials
[2:26:58.160 --> 2:27:01.800]  of the vaccine are magnetic, you know, so who knows?
[2:27:01.800 --> 2:27:04.160]  I mean, again, we're playing in the dark.
[2:27:04.160 --> 2:27:08.760]  This is a giant Manhattan-level project thing, 100 times bigger than that.
[2:27:08.760 --> 2:27:12.600]  It's a, and they're desperate on a timeline, like you said, for some big event.
[2:27:12.600 --> 2:27:14.360]  I don't think it's going well for them.
[2:27:14.360 --> 2:27:19.120]  Twenty-some percent of Australia, 10 percent of India, only half of America.
[2:27:19.120 --> 2:27:21.960]  I think they're really upset right now, doctor.
[2:27:21.960 --> 2:27:25.120]  I think that's the end game for them if we stand up now.
[2:27:25.120 --> 2:27:26.120]  We have to stand up.
[2:27:26.120 --> 2:27:28.440]  We have a window of opportunity to take our world back.
[2:27:28.440 --> 2:27:30.960]  Ultimately, we're in a spiritual war here.
[2:27:30.960 --> 2:27:35.240]  And at some point, you have to realize that if, that this is after your children and your
[2:27:35.240 --> 2:27:39.440]  future children, it's just not about going to be able to take a trip to the Dominican
[2:27:39.440 --> 2:27:41.240]  Republic or someplace.
[2:27:41.240 --> 2:27:42.400]  Don't accede to evil.
[2:27:42.400 --> 2:27:46.480]  Don't accede to malice, it's the, you know, you have to stand up now and, and we have
[2:27:46.480 --> 2:27:47.480]  to resist this.
[2:27:47.480 --> 2:27:51.560]  Yeah, people think you give up and then you get through, no, it wants more, more, more,
[2:27:51.560 --> 2:27:52.560]  more, more.
[2:27:52.560 --> 2:27:53.560]  Yeah.
[2:27:53.560 --> 2:27:54.560]  Can't do it.
[2:27:54.560 --> 2:27:58.360]  Well, I'm really impressed, Dr. Lee Merritt, we got 30 seconds left.
[2:27:58.360 --> 2:28:00.400]  Close in comment, themedicalrebel.com.
[2:28:00.400 --> 2:28:04.280]  Well, again, I, I, like I say, I think it's a spiritual war.
[2:28:04.280 --> 2:28:09.920]  I think you need to get, get back in touch with your own spirituality with God and realize
[2:28:09.920 --> 2:28:13.000]  we're in a big problem here unless we all work together.
[2:28:13.000 --> 2:28:14.000]  We cannot do this.
[2:28:14.000 --> 2:28:15.000]  Don't wait.
[2:28:15.000 --> 2:28:18.320]  If we wait, what's going to happen is just like in the old Soviet Union, when the checker
[2:28:18.320 --> 2:28:21.680]  would come along in the middle of the night and say, come quietly, neighbor, don't don't
[2:28:21.680 --> 2:28:22.680]  or come quietly.
[2:28:22.680 --> 2:28:24.120]  Don't disturb the neighbors.
[2:28:24.120 --> 2:28:26.400]  We cannot let them pick us off singly.
[2:28:26.400 --> 2:28:29.440]  It's now our time to stand up now or never, guys.
[2:28:29.440 --> 2:28:30.440]  That's right.
[2:28:30.440 --> 2:28:34.840]  Alexander Schultz and it's a gulag archipelago, Dr. Lee Merritt, themedicalrebel.com.
[2:28:34.840 --> 2:28:35.840]  Thank you for your time.
[2:28:35.840 --> 2:28:37.600]  Come back again soon.
[2:28:37.600 --> 2:28:38.600]  Thank you.
[2:28:38.600 --> 2:28:39.920]  You're an amazing lady.
[2:28:39.920 --> 2:28:40.920]  All right.
[2:28:40.920 --> 2:28:46.800]  I got a segment of articles and then we've got the folks from Project Veritas with breaking
[2:28:46.800 --> 2:28:52.600]  news, infowars.com, newswars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[2:28:52.600 --> 2:28:53.600]  Share the live links now.
[2:28:53.600 --> 2:28:57.200]  You're the way we reach new people.
[2:28:57.200 --> 2:29:01.040]  If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid
[2:29:01.040 --> 2:29:05.720]  electricity, this will be the most important message you'll hear this year.
[2:29:05.720 --> 2:29:06.720]  Here's why.
[2:29:06.720 --> 2:29:10.600]  We now have a small number of solar generators back in stock.
[2:29:10.600 --> 2:29:15.640]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving backup power when you need it most.
[2:29:15.640 --> 2:29:20.800]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes, and
[2:29:20.800 --> 2:29:24.720]  produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[2:29:24.720 --> 2:29:28.640]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues, or just getting off the
[2:29:28.640 --> 2:29:33.400]  grid, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[2:29:33.400 --> 2:29:38.680]  The better all this week, radio listeners get over $700 in free off-the-grid bonuses
[2:29:38.680 --> 2:29:39.680]  too.
[2:29:39.680 --> 2:29:43.320]  Go to mysolarbackup.com to learn more and check availability.
[2:29:43.320 --> 2:29:45.280]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[2:29:45.280 --> 2:29:49.880]  Look for the free report, crisis cooling, how to make absolutely sure your meat, milk,
[2:29:49.880 --> 2:29:53.760]  and medicines stay safe and cool in any power outage.
[2:29:53.760 --> 2:29:58.400]  Yours free at mysolarbackup.com.
[2:29:58.400 --> 2:30:03.240]  So when I first started taking survival skills, basically I was 275 pounds overweight.
[2:30:03.240 --> 2:30:05.600]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[2:30:05.600 --> 2:30:10.200]  I was barely holding on to a job, and I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[2:30:10.200 --> 2:30:14.720]  So the first one I got was the original survival shield, the X1, and it worked pretty good.
[2:30:14.720 --> 2:30:17.800]  And then shortly thereafter, you came out with that too, you had, you know, with a deep
[2:30:17.800 --> 2:30:20.760]  burden of course, you know, and I got really excited about that, so I took it.
[2:30:20.760 --> 2:30:27.080]  And man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened.
[2:30:27.080 --> 2:30:31.760]  You know, I could think again, I could connect with people again, and over the course of
[2:30:31.760 --> 2:30:35.800]  the next couple of years, I got my health back and I religiously take basically all
[2:30:35.800 --> 2:30:36.800]  of your supplements.
[2:30:36.800 --> 2:30:38.800]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[2:30:38.800 --> 2:30:40.920]  The one I like recently is knockout.
[2:30:40.920 --> 2:30:43.160]  It literally, like if you want to sleep, just take it.
[2:30:43.160 --> 2:30:44.160]  It's amazing.
[2:30:44.160 --> 2:30:45.160]  It works.
[2:30:45.160 --> 2:30:48.360]  But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean, we have to break free of
[2:30:48.360 --> 2:30:52.360]  the globalist system, and the only way to do that is to take our own health into our
[2:30:52.360 --> 2:30:53.360]  own hands.
[2:30:53.360 --> 2:30:54.360]  Beautifully said, brother.
[2:30:54.360 --> 2:30:58.560]  I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.
[2:30:58.560 --> 2:31:03.720]  Let's go back in time, say to the mid 1990s, and then imagine a science fiction movie set
[2:31:03.720 --> 2:31:08.720]  in the year 2020, where a world government's being established, where members of Congress
[2:31:08.720 --> 2:31:13.640]  and former presidents are censured by big tech, and where if you don't take an experimental
[2:31:13.640 --> 2:31:19.600]  injection that grows blood clots and prions all over your body, then you're not allowed
[2:31:19.600 --> 2:31:22.200]  to fly on an airplane.
[2:31:22.200 --> 2:31:24.840]  Think about that, because that's where we are.
[2:31:24.840 --> 2:31:29.800]  Imagine just 20, 30 years ago, tell just five years ago, if somebody told you this would
[2:31:29.800 --> 2:31:30.800]  be happening.
[2:31:30.800 --> 2:31:32.800]  But it is happening now.
[2:31:32.800 --> 2:31:36.920]  And then they tell you, oh, sorry, it's out of vaccines and gene therapy, and it doesn't
[2:31:36.920 --> 2:31:37.920]  really work.
[2:31:37.920 --> 2:31:39.840]  So you got to take it every few months.
[2:31:39.840 --> 2:31:44.000]  And the people that have submitted say, great, I want to take it all the time so I can go
[2:31:44.000 --> 2:31:47.480]  outside and not get sick from COVID, even though it gets you sick from COVID.
[2:31:47.480 --> 2:31:51.680]  And now there's record numbers of really sick people from the sloughing, the shedding
[2:31:51.680 --> 2:31:52.680]  of the virus.
[2:31:52.680 --> 2:31:54.560]  And that's in mainline studies.
[2:31:54.560 --> 2:31:58.760]  Bill Gates and Fauci did this, need to go to prison for it right now.
[2:31:58.760 --> 2:32:02.480]  Not all vitamin and mineral supplements are equal.
[2:32:02.480 --> 2:32:03.480]  Many of them are synthetic.
[2:32:03.480 --> 2:32:05.520]  Many of them have fillers and additives.
[2:32:05.520 --> 2:32:08.080]  Many of them just pass right through the body and are absorbed.
[2:32:08.080 --> 2:32:13.200]  But that's not the case with our incredibly popular, because it's so effective product
[2:32:13.200 --> 2:32:16.960]  that it's now been sold out for months, but it's finally back in stock.
[2:32:16.960 --> 2:32:19.880]  And that is vitamin, mineral fusion.
[2:32:19.880 --> 2:32:24.200]  All the essential vitamins, all the essential minerals, a bunch of chiamino acids to help
[2:32:24.200 --> 2:32:26.960]  it upload better into your body and your cells.
[2:32:26.960 --> 2:32:30.040]  It's in powder form, great for children, it's great for adults.
[2:32:30.040 --> 2:32:34.000]  It's really important for folks that are older, because they don't absorb as well through
[2:32:34.000 --> 2:32:35.000]  their guts.
[2:32:35.000 --> 2:32:37.000]  So this liquid formula really, really does it.
[2:32:37.000 --> 2:32:40.880]  You mix up a picture of it every couple of days, put it in the refrigerator, keep it
[2:32:40.880 --> 2:32:41.880]  out in the kitchen.
[2:32:41.880 --> 2:32:44.680]  And just remember to drink it in the morning and in the evening.
[2:32:44.680 --> 2:32:45.680]  It tastes great.
[2:32:45.680 --> 2:32:50.680]  It makes your body healthy, it boosts your immune system, and it funds the InfoWare.
[2:32:50.680 --> 2:32:55.680]  A true 361, so vitamin, mineral fusion sold out for months is back in stock for a limited
[2:32:55.680 --> 2:33:25.640]  time, 33% off InfoWareStore.com.
[2:33:25.640 --> 2:33:27.920]  Well, we all live long enough to be inside.
[2:33:27.920 --> 2:33:32.440]  They attempted new world order, global government takeover, and they used the virus just like
[2:33:32.440 --> 2:33:35.840]  they said they'd do in so many of their battle plans.
[2:33:35.840 --> 2:33:37.000]  That was what they always settled on.
[2:33:37.000 --> 2:33:40.600]  They said this would be the best thing to do, and they did it.
[2:33:40.600 --> 2:33:43.640]  They want to use race war and economic collapse as well.
[2:33:43.640 --> 2:33:49.960]  They're getting pretty close to that, and I got a big stack of economic news I want to
[2:33:49.960 --> 2:33:50.960]  hit in a moment.
[2:33:50.960 --> 2:33:56.120]  But first, look at this article out of Fox News.
[2:33:56.120 --> 2:34:04.600]  Larry Elder surges past Gavin Newsom and Google searches and exit polls that are being done
[2:34:04.600 --> 2:34:10.720]  from people that have been asked about their mail-in ballots are saying it looks like 70%
[2:34:10.720 --> 2:34:15.560]  of people are voting to recall Newsom, and then it's a whole bunch of candidates, whoever
[2:34:15.560 --> 2:34:20.200]  gets the majority wins, or whoever gets the most votes, none of the majority wins.
[2:34:20.200 --> 2:34:24.840]  So it's an up or down vote, and then whoever gets the largest number.
[2:34:24.840 --> 2:34:28.400]  And so they're calling them a white supremacist, and all this other ridiculous crap.
[2:34:28.400 --> 2:34:36.560]  But that doesn't seem to matter, because there's an ace in the hole.
[2:34:36.560 --> 2:34:41.600]  Just like there was an ace in the hole in the presidential election against President
[2:34:41.600 --> 2:34:42.600]  Trump.
[2:34:42.600 --> 2:34:47.760]  And that's all these felons riding around, grabbing the mail-in ballots and throwing
[2:34:47.760 --> 2:34:53.360]  the ones away that are for Trump, and making sure the ones for Biden get voted on.
[2:34:53.360 --> 2:35:00.440]  And they just got somebody doing it again yesterday in California for Newsom.
[2:35:00.440 --> 2:35:06.040]  Let's play the clip.
[2:35:06.040 --> 2:35:10.760]  Wondering tonight, so was it a voter fraud scheme or something else?
[2:35:10.760 --> 2:35:15.760]  Investigators are now trying to determine why it is that more than 300 recall ballots
[2:35:15.760 --> 2:35:22.000]  were found inside a man's car at this 7-Eleven in Torrance.
[2:35:22.000 --> 2:35:27.160]  More than 300 mail-in ballots for the governor's recall race were found inside a car parked
[2:35:27.160 --> 2:35:31.080]  at this Torrance 7-Eleven with a man sleeping inside of it.
[2:35:31.080 --> 2:35:35.320]  So that's kind of the part where we're at now with this investigation, is everyone
[2:35:35.320 --> 2:35:39.400]  wants to know two questions, why were the ballots in his vehicle, what was his intent
[2:35:39.400 --> 2:35:41.640]  with those ballots, and that's what we're trying to figure out.
[2:35:41.640 --> 2:35:45.820]  He was an employee at the convenience store on Emerald Street near Hawthorne Boulevard
[2:35:45.820 --> 2:35:51.800]  that alerted police last Monday around 10.45 p.m. about the man sleeping in his driver's
[2:35:51.800 --> 2:35:52.800]  seat.
[2:35:52.800 --> 2:35:56.200]  And stolen ballots were all police found inside the car.
[2:35:56.200 --> 2:35:59.680]  There was Xanax, a gun, meth, and other mail.
[2:35:59.680 --> 2:36:04.560]  He was arrested on several charges related to possession of the firearm, the narcotics,
[2:36:04.560 --> 2:36:10.760]  the theft of identity theft, as well as receiving stolen property and some other charges as well.
[2:36:10.760 --> 2:36:15.440]  Several agencies, including Torrance Police, the U.S. Postal Service, and the LA County
[2:36:15.440 --> 2:36:21.560]  District Attorney's Office are now investigating how these stolen ballots ended up inside
[2:36:21.560 --> 2:36:24.000]  a convicted felon's back seat.
[2:36:24.000 --> 2:36:28.400]  Police say most of the ballots were for Lawndale residents and a few for Compton.
[2:36:28.400 --> 2:36:33.040]  We have been working with the registrar's office to get them a list of all those names
[2:36:33.040 --> 2:36:37.280]  that were on those ballots so they can be notified and then new ballots can be re-sent
[2:36:37.280 --> 2:36:38.440]  to them in time.
[2:36:38.440 --> 2:36:43.040]  The election to recall Governor Gavin Newsom is set for September 14th.
[2:36:43.040 --> 2:36:48.040]  Hopefully the election isn't rigged this time or if it was last time, I'm not sure.
[2:36:48.040 --> 2:36:54.080]  But hopefully there is no fraud ballots out there.
[2:36:54.080 --> 2:37:02.600]  The lawyers are also looking into whether this incident is connected to any other theft
[2:37:02.600 --> 2:37:03.600]  of recalled ballots.
[2:37:03.600 --> 2:37:07.120]  For now reporting live here in Torrance, Mary Beth McDane will send back to you guys in
[2:37:07.120 --> 2:37:09.120]  the studio.
[2:37:09.120 --> 2:37:16.480]  So there you go, we hope it isn't rigged like last time, you mean like last year, eight,
[2:37:16.480 --> 2:37:17.480]  nine months ago.
[2:37:17.480 --> 2:37:21.840]  And you know that brings me to my frustration.
[2:37:21.840 --> 2:37:27.760]  I did not attack Trump on Sunday night, something the audience has been overwhelming support
[2:37:27.760 --> 2:37:30.200]  about by the way.
[2:37:30.200 --> 2:37:35.080]  They think it's been too long and that I haven't done enough.
[2:37:35.080 --> 2:37:39.680]  I did that because I'm genuinely upset about these so-called vaccines.
[2:37:39.680 --> 2:37:44.120]  I'm genuinely upset that they don't work other than making you sick and that we've invested
[2:37:44.120 --> 2:37:50.200]  so much in Trump and that he's up there saying that it works great, he'll tell you if it
[2:37:50.200 --> 2:37:51.200]  doesn't work.
[2:37:51.200 --> 2:37:56.560]  Hey Trump, they admit it doesn't work, it's why they've got the booster shot.
[2:37:56.560 --> 2:37:59.920]  Which is then the next booster, the next booster, the next booster.
[2:37:59.920 --> 2:38:07.960]  Last week he was on Fox and Friends and said he thought it was a scam, that he thought the
[2:38:07.960 --> 2:38:16.320]  Pfizer CEO was wanting to make 10 billion off the booster and I thought, wow, that's great.
[2:38:16.320 --> 2:38:22.120]  Trump's waking up, I was right about Trump, he's a good guy.
[2:38:22.120 --> 2:38:27.560]  And then that didn't happen and I saw folks booing and so I'm spontaneous, we don't have
[2:38:27.560 --> 2:38:32.000]  committee hearings, we don't have focus groups about what I say or do, the Democrats do me
[2:38:32.000 --> 2:38:36.840]  all the time, they're always like where are the focus groups, where are the committee
[2:38:36.840 --> 2:38:40.360]  meetings, who tells you what to say?
[2:38:40.360 --> 2:38:44.640]  My gut, my brain, I mean, I'm pissed off.
[2:38:44.640 --> 2:38:49.200]  Trump last week comes out and says this vaccine looks like a scam, I'm like thank God he was
[2:38:49.200 --> 2:38:51.680]  a good guy, we weren't wrong about it.
[2:38:51.680 --> 2:38:55.080]  And then he goes to Alabama and says I took it, it worked great, I'll tell you it doesn't
[2:38:55.080 --> 2:38:56.080]  work.
[2:38:56.080 --> 2:39:03.880]  I'll just make it sick, so I said I know you're a smart guy, so are you evil?
[2:39:03.880 --> 2:39:08.240]  Or maybe you're a dumbass, I mean, it's a rhetorical question, it's better if Trump
[2:39:08.240 --> 2:39:14.920]  is just ignorant about this than if he did this on purpose because then he'll, he's
[2:39:14.920 --> 2:39:15.920]  my enemy.
[2:39:15.920 --> 2:39:20.480]  But look at his enemies, look at how the globalists hate him, I mean, he did a lot of good things
[2:39:20.480 --> 2:39:27.280]  and I think Trump meant well, but I'm not in a cult here, I'm not gonna just sit here
[2:39:27.280 --> 2:39:32.000]  and support what Trump does, but at the same time the audience really liked me attacking
[2:39:32.000 --> 2:39:35.680]  Trump and I don't just go off with the audience once, though I do respect you and listen to
[2:39:35.680 --> 2:39:39.600]  you because you usually agree with me anyways, but sometimes I'm wrong and I bounce that
[2:39:39.600 --> 2:39:41.360]  off of you.
[2:39:41.360 --> 2:39:45.160]  Let's not throw the baby out with the bath water, he's getting good Republicans elected,
[2:39:45.160 --> 2:39:51.560]  the globalist hating, they're persecuting his family, he's a lot better than Biden,
[2:39:51.560 --> 2:39:56.560]  and we don't, we want to keep him as a vehicle to get populist elected.
[2:39:56.560 --> 2:40:03.920]  So sure, I get a lot of attention and 20-something million views and all this big extra audience
[2:40:03.920 --> 2:40:08.760]  tuning in because a lot of my audience has gotten mad at me over the years, I mean, we
[2:40:08.760 --> 2:40:15.040]  lost a lot of audience supporting Trump, we lost a lot of money supporting Trump.
[2:40:15.040 --> 2:40:21.320]  So my big pet peeves is people saying, Joan supports Trump because he gets money from
[2:40:21.320 --> 2:40:22.320]  it.
[2:40:22.320 --> 2:40:30.040]  No, I got de-platformed and sued over Trump, but I knew that he was the real deal in many
[2:40:30.040 --> 2:40:35.040]  ways and was trying to secure the borders and standing up at China and got way better
[2:40:35.040 --> 2:40:39.520]  trade deals and the list goes on and on, so I'm not gonna explain myself, the audience
[2:40:39.520 --> 2:40:44.560]  gets it, I think you're in the same boat as me, it's just that I'm not gonna sit here
[2:40:44.560 --> 2:40:45.560]  like a bitch.
[2:40:45.560 --> 2:40:51.040]  And I don't mean like a woman, I mean just like a bitch, like a punk, while Trump does
[2:40:51.040 --> 2:40:56.280]  whatever he wants and then I sit there and support his ass with that corrupt ass Pfizer
[2:40:56.280 --> 2:41:01.880]  that has a business model to take over our very, very genetics and run our lives and
[2:41:01.880 --> 2:41:07.960]  give us all these damn poisons, so that's where I am on that, but by administration
[2:41:07.960 --> 2:41:17.320]  urges Supreme Court to preserve eviction moratorium, that'll further bankrupt the small renters,
[2:41:17.320 --> 2:41:22.200]  small landlords, Ken Blackwell, Biden's eviction moratorium has small landlords on the brink,
[2:41:22.200 --> 2:41:25.840]  well don't worry, the Chinese are buying it all up.
[2:41:25.840 --> 2:41:33.840]  Pluridon Piven, here we go, moderate dim strike deal over a $4.1 trillion economic plan,
[2:41:33.840 --> 2:41:39.000]  just warns you can't print money, but you can't print stuff, yeah, you can print money,
[2:41:39.000 --> 2:41:40.000]  you can't print stuff.
[2:41:40.000 --> 2:41:44.600]  Speaking of that, we're having real trouble with our supply chains, so buy a book, buy
[2:41:44.600 --> 2:41:49.360]  a film, buy a t-shirt now, who knows we'll have supplies in the future, everything we've

[2:42:39.520 --> 2:42:45.440]  Tards, we also have our liquid turmeric formula discounted back in stock as well, so it's
[2:42:45.440 --> 2:42:51.400]  all there at infowarstore.com or triple eight, two five three, three one three nine, alright
[2:42:51.400 --> 2:42:57.320]  project Veritas has gotten a big story and we'll talk to them on that side.
[2:42:57.320 --> 2:43:02.840]  The purpose of fear is to call us into action and there is plenty to be afraid of today.
[2:43:02.840 --> 2:43:08.560]  Half the population has lined up for an untested, deadly and debilitating experimental injection
[2:43:08.560 --> 2:43:12.760]  because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease.
[2:43:12.760 --> 2:43:17.880]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80% of the population
[2:43:17.880 --> 2:43:22.720]  hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years.
[2:43:22.720 --> 2:43:27.160]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell, we know this is all really happening and it's
[2:43:27.160 --> 2:43:32.040]  unbelievably unsettling to see, but there is only two things to do.
[2:43:32.040 --> 2:43:36.280]  We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game, if enough people awaken from
[2:43:36.280 --> 2:43:41.600]  the cold spell, then we win, but even when we win and we eventually will, the days of
[2:43:41.600 --> 2:43:46.560]  convenience are soon coming to an end and so we must prepare, get up to a year's worth
[2:43:46.560 --> 2:43:53.560]  of storable foods, water filtration, survival gear, seeds, shortwave radios, and life-saving
[2:43:53.560 --> 2:43:56.560]  knowledge at infoorstore.com.
[2:43:56.560 --> 2:44:00.960]  So what's the most important part, let's say in a bulldozer running over the globalist?
[2:44:00.960 --> 2:44:05.520]  The treads, the wheels, the engine, the scoop on the front, it's all very important, but
[2:44:05.520 --> 2:44:09.320]  the fuel is paramount and that's my allegor.
[2:44:09.320 --> 2:44:14.080]  Turbo force is vitamins, minerals, amino acids that synergistically work with six different
[2:44:14.080 --> 2:44:18.520]  natural forms of healthy clean energy that last for ten hours in the average metabolic
[2:44:18.520 --> 2:44:20.280]  system, the capitalism of a human.
[2:44:20.280 --> 2:44:22.880]  Some people get fifteen hours out of this, some people get about eight hours, but people
[2:44:22.880 --> 2:44:26.200]  take this, people take it in sports, people cannot believe it's the best they've ever
[2:44:26.200 --> 2:44:32.280]  had because it's not pipe, nobody puts as much product into their pre-workouts, their
[2:44:32.280 --> 2:44:36.320]  post-workouts, you can call us whatever you want, it's a total solution, all around the
[2:44:36.320 --> 2:44:37.440]  best you're going to find.
[2:44:37.440 --> 2:44:42.360]  Turbo force, without you, we don't roll, with you we search forward together, it's like
[2:44:42.360 --> 2:44:46.040]  a bulldozer without the diesel fuel, if we don't have your financial support, we will
[2:44:46.040 --> 2:44:49.080]  be defeated, you support us to get products you already need that literally fuel your
[2:44:49.080 --> 2:44:58.200]  body and your mind, it's a win-win, 360 together, infowarstore.com or AAA-253-3139.

[2:45:02.520 --> 2:45:07.160]  has been proven that a poor sleep schedule is linked with numerous health problems including

[2:45:12.640 --> 2:45:13.640]  system.

[2:45:55.960 --> 2:46:03.360]  Not all vitamin and mineral supplements are equal, many of them are synthetic, many of
[2:46:03.360 --> 2:46:07.800]  them have fillers and additives, many of them just pass right through the body and are
[2:46:07.800 --> 2:46:08.800]  not absorbed.
[2:46:08.800 --> 2:46:12.800]  But that's not the case with our incredibly popular because it's so effective product
[2:46:12.800 --> 2:46:18.600]  that has now been sold out for months, but it's finally back in stock and that is vitamin

[2:47:01.280 --> 2:47:12.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:47:12.000 --> 2:47:15.440]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[2:47:15.440 --> 2:47:20.400]  Mario Balaban of Project Veritas joins us here in one moment and I really called this
[2:47:20.400 --> 2:47:24.600]  last night to my wife and to my lawyers.
[2:47:24.600 --> 2:47:31.120]  The FBI basically said they'd drop charges on Owen Schreuer for attacking the Capitol
[2:47:31.120 --> 2:47:38.200]  and going into all the stuff he didn't do, they just won our phones and I'm like, I even
[2:47:38.200 --> 2:47:42.040]  told my lawyers, I said, yeah, they dropped out, I should give them our phones because
[2:47:42.040 --> 2:47:46.480]  there's no coordination to attack the Capitol on them, but why don't they just get warrants?
[2:47:46.480 --> 2:47:50.640]  This is getting really weird and then the judge comes out and says you shouldn't be
[2:47:50.640 --> 2:47:54.640]  targeting journalists and all this, there's like literally 20 national news articles
[2:47:54.640 --> 2:47:58.760]  on that, I didn't even want to talk about ourselves today on air, I just got them and
[2:47:58.760 --> 2:48:06.560]  then I just got the news, Pelosi specifically is targeting me and wants me investigated.
[2:48:06.560 --> 2:48:12.800]  That's been released by her in some weird congressional subpoena, these people are nuts, I mean, look
[2:48:12.800 --> 2:48:22.200]  at her, my God, she had sex with King Tut, I mean, I'm sorry, let's get to our big story
[2:48:22.200 --> 2:48:26.440]  right now, I'll cover this to start the next hour, let me have a guest toast, DHS insider
[2:48:26.440 --> 2:48:31.880]  blows whistle on global child sex trafficking cartels, exploiting immigration loophole, Mario
[2:48:31.880 --> 2:48:39.040]  Balaban of the great folks over project Veritas joins us to break this down. Absolutely amazing,
[2:48:39.040 --> 2:48:44.400]  the full 70 minute report is obviously a project veritas.com, it's on info wars.com, but just
[2:48:44.400 --> 2:48:49.960]  the magnitude of this and how our government under Democrats uses NGOs, this isn't the
[2:48:49.960 --> 2:48:53.760]  first time Democrats have done this has done it in Haiti, they've done it in the Balkans,
[2:48:53.760 --> 2:48:57.680]  but this is a big coup, this is, I mean, I don't know how you guys keep topping yourselves,
[2:48:57.680 --> 2:49:02.600]  this is so historic and so important. Thanks for joining us Mario. Alex, thank you so much
[2:49:02.600 --> 2:49:07.400]  for having me. Like you said, it is truly frightening what's going on. What we uncovered
[2:49:07.400 --> 2:49:11.800]  what this latest whistleblower is that criminal migrants that are coming through the border,
[2:49:11.800 --> 2:49:15.640]  they're using something that they call as a technical term, government term, reasonable
[2:49:15.640 --> 2:49:21.360]  fear or credible fear to loophole according to this insider to avoid deportation. And these
[2:49:21.360 --> 2:49:25.800]  are the same people according to the insider that are causing the violence at home and
[2:49:25.800 --> 2:49:29.840]  abroad. So basically, you know, by claiming that they're in danger, right, when they
[2:49:29.840 --> 2:49:36.360]  come through the border, you know, they are basically allowed to be removed from the something
[2:49:36.360 --> 2:49:43.400]  called the Transnational Organized Crime Watchlist. So criminal migrants are even trained to,
[2:49:43.400 --> 2:49:48.680]  you know, tell these, you know, officials from the DHS and from the CBP that they're
[2:49:48.680 --> 2:49:52.720]  afraid to go home, they're trained to say that, because they know that they might be
[2:49:52.720 --> 2:49:57.600]  able to seek asylum and even be removed from the Transnational Criminal Organization Watchlist.
[2:49:57.600 --> 2:50:04.440]  Wow. So the literal traffickers are being told by insiders how to cloak themselves and
[2:50:04.440 --> 2:50:08.480]  how to protect our identity and pierce the United States.
[2:50:08.480 --> 2:50:13.480]  Exactly. They're allowed to do that. And with this done, it gets worse. So while they're
[2:50:13.480 --> 2:50:20.080]  awaiting their asylum decision, they're allowed to file here for what's called an employment
[2:50:20.080 --> 2:50:25.200]  authorization card. That grants them the right to not only stay in the United States, but
[2:50:25.200 --> 2:50:30.240]  to work in the United States, and they can stay in the U.S. and do that legally. So these
[2:50:30.240 --> 2:50:33.040]  are, we're not talking about just illegal immigrants crossing, we're talking about actual
[2:50:33.040 --> 2:50:37.560]  criminal migrants who are on the Watchlist, then are removed from the Watchlist.
[2:50:37.560 --> 2:50:40.880]  Oh, absolutely. I've been down there probably 10 times last year.
[2:50:40.880 --> 2:50:45.400]  And you see men and women who are clearly not the parents because you see them day after
[2:50:45.400 --> 2:50:48.760]  day with the groups of little kids by themselves.
[2:50:48.760 --> 2:50:55.480]  Right. And that gets to my other point is that after getting all these benefits from
[2:50:55.480 --> 2:51:00.120]  the government, some of them are even attempting to sponsor unaccompanied minors in the United
[2:51:00.120 --> 2:51:05.240]  States. And as our insider said, all of these Transnational Criminal Organizations are directly
[2:51:05.240 --> 2:51:11.080]  or indirectly involved with sex trafficking, often times of children. So we have here on
[2:51:11.080 --> 2:51:15.480]  record before the interview, eight of these criminal migrants applied for what's called
[2:51:15.480 --> 2:51:23.520]  to sponsor unaccompanied alien children, UAC. A ninth one came out after our release, after
[2:51:23.520 --> 2:51:29.120]  the interview took place. And what's most shocking is that one of these nine criminals
[2:51:29.120 --> 2:51:35.600]  actually has on record crimes against 27 children, I mean, 27 children. And this person was still
[2:51:35.600 --> 2:51:38.960]  allowed to stay in the country under the reasonable fear loophole.
[2:51:38.960 --> 2:51:45.080]  Wow. One person had 27 crimes against children and was allowed to stay. That's just insane.
[2:51:45.080 --> 2:51:51.240]  Yes, exactly. I mean, that's this is a very powerful story. We have more whistleblowers
[2:51:51.240 --> 2:51:55.680]  inside the DHS. And I wanted to bring up something you talked about with James O'Keefe when he
[2:51:55.680 --> 2:51:59.600]  was in studio with you is this video has gotten so much traction online. And it's because
[2:51:59.600 --> 2:52:04.520]  of distribution by proxy. It's because people are tweeting out this video, even though we're
[2:52:04.520 --> 2:52:08.960]  banned from Twitter. After, you know, you give a powerful endorsement to our, you know, cause
[2:52:08.960 --> 2:52:14.760]  of click to tweet. This video has across platforms about over a million views already.
[2:52:14.760 --> 2:52:20.160]  So kudos to you for promoting a beautiful job of viewers and listeners. This is a war
[2:52:20.160 --> 2:52:26.680]  and the children are counting on us. And it's these are literal drug gangs, convicted drug
[2:52:26.680 --> 2:52:32.240]  criminals, smugglers. And as you know, the DHS admits many children are passed back and
[2:52:32.240 --> 2:52:38.160]  forth over the border and uses a football. Right. No, and it's especially frightening
[2:52:38.160 --> 2:52:42.640]  in this moment. Also, as we look at what's happening abroad, for example, in Afghanistan,
[2:52:42.640 --> 2:52:46.400]  you know, think about how vulnerable just generally our border is in so many different
[2:52:46.400 --> 2:52:50.840]  ways. What is to say that, you know, not only, you know, these criminal organizations like
[2:52:50.840 --> 2:52:55.480]  MS 13, we know are coming through the border. But now that, you know, these terrorists have
[2:52:55.480 --> 2:52:59.480]  taken over an entire country, what's to say that they won't create, you know, further
[2:52:59.480 --> 2:53:04.760]  chaos and have more abilities to bring in their allies through the border in this, in
[2:53:04.760 --> 2:53:09.640]  this chaos and this crisis. Well, that's it. We know how the cartels work. That's why Pelosi
[2:53:09.640 --> 2:53:14.760]  said MS 13 are God's children three years ago, is that the Democrats are laundering
[2:53:14.760 --> 2:53:20.440]  this money. They are they are they are part and parcel of the cartels. There's certainly
[2:53:20.440 --> 2:53:25.760]  a lot of political interest here. I mean, we know that, you know, there's there's money
[2:53:25.760 --> 2:53:30.120]  involved. There's drugs. There's a lot of money. And of course, there's a voting issue
[2:53:30.120 --> 2:53:35.360]  that many bring up. So there's that concern that's ongoing. But another concern, I think
[2:53:35.360 --> 2:53:40.720]  that with this vulnerable border is certainly the terror threat that this might, you know,
[2:53:40.720 --> 2:53:46.100]  you know, incentivize or encourage foreign actors to come and actually, you know, easily
[2:53:46.100 --> 2:53:53.080]  access our country. What else is Project Veritas? I mean, you guys are working on a lot of stuff,
[2:53:53.080 --> 2:53:57.120]  but in this field, what else do we expect to be coming out? Well, I can tell you we
[2:53:57.120 --> 2:54:02.440]  have more whistleblowers inside the government, DHS, other institutions. So stay tuned for
[2:54:02.440 --> 2:54:08.200]  that. They'll be coming out very soon. And, you know, we're looking also for whistleblowers
[2:54:08.200 --> 2:54:12.600]  who are working in big pharma or whistleblowers working in health agencies, government health
[2:54:12.600 --> 2:54:18.760]  agencies. We're seeing, you know, this this avalanche of mandates and unconstitutional
[2:54:18.760 --> 2:54:23.160]  orders taking place across the country. People are reaching out to us desperately asking for
[2:54:23.160 --> 2:54:28.480]  help. How can they, you know, keep their job? How can they, you know, avoid certain fines
[2:54:28.480 --> 2:54:34.920]  or all sorts of punishment if they don't want to take the vaccine, for example, or the mask
[2:54:34.920 --> 2:54:40.320]  mandates? It's truly frightening. And we encourage anyone with information in those institutions,
[2:54:40.320 --> 2:54:46.640]  be it health agencies or big pharma, to come forward to us and, you know, help save our
[2:54:46.640 --> 2:54:47.640]  country.
[2:54:47.640 --> 2:54:54.200]  I mean, clearly, they've broken the border. Clearly, this is treason. We had the leaked
[2:54:54.200 --> 2:54:59.000]  DHS had what two weeks ago saying it's all broken. It's a failure. But was it that the
[2:54:59.000 --> 2:55:02.040]  plan to break the border to begin with?
[2:55:02.040 --> 2:55:06.960]  I mean, it certainly looks like it. I can't speak to what my administration wants to do
[2:55:06.960 --> 2:55:11.240]  or what their intentions are. But it's it's clear then the last six months, not only from
[2:55:11.240 --> 2:55:15.240]  what we've seen in the news, but from the insiders that have come to us directly. There's chaos
[2:55:15.240 --> 2:55:19.760]  at the border. There's instability. And people certainly are not sure, you know, who work
[2:55:19.760 --> 2:55:26.600]  at, you know, CBP and Border Patrol are very, you know, very upset about what's happening.
[2:55:26.600 --> 2:55:33.760]  Well, they're trying to make America a failed state. And if we can't control our borders,
[2:55:33.760 --> 2:55:40.080]  and we can't control even exiting Afghanistan, I mean, it's it's it's really intentional
[2:55:40.080 --> 2:55:46.600]  to make us a failed state. Are you familiar with the cloud and pivot strategy?
[2:55:46.600 --> 2:55:50.880]  I've heard of that. Yeah, but I'm not too familiar with it.
[2:55:50.880 --> 2:55:56.400]  It's just a Democratic Party plan to implode economies to collapse societies.
[2:55:56.400 --> 2:56:01.440]  It's a welfare state, correct? It's it's it's it's it's implode the society to the to the
[2:56:01.440 --> 2:56:04.280]  make everybody dependent on a welfare state. Yes, sir.
[2:56:04.280 --> 2:56:07.480]  Okay, yes, I am familiar with it. Yes, absolutely.
[2:56:07.480 --> 2:56:12.600]  It is no exact. No, I was going to say, you know, not only is that happening in the United
[2:56:12.600 --> 2:56:18.760]  States with, you know, some American citizens, but they're also expanding that idea to look
[2:56:18.760 --> 2:56:22.880]  what it looks like. Illegals are coming to the country.
[2:56:22.880 --> 2:56:26.760]  Absolutely they're they're trying to bring in a permanent underclass. They control in
[2:56:26.760 --> 2:56:30.120]  closing Mario. How do you think we counter that?
[2:56:30.120 --> 2:56:35.760]  It's I mean, like James says, the only solution that Project Veritas sees is exposure. We
[2:56:35.760 --> 2:56:40.400]  need, you know, undercover footage of people saying things that they don't want to go public.
[2:56:40.400 --> 2:56:44.360]  And most importantly, we need whistleblowers in these powerful institutions that are willing
[2:56:44.360 --> 2:56:49.120]  to, you know, do the brave thing to be to be brave, be courageous and come forward with
[2:56:49.120 --> 2:56:55.560]  information and know that we at Project Veritas will publish it, you know, given the severity
[2:56:55.560 --> 2:56:59.480]  of the situation. Mario Ballabon from the great folks at Project
[2:56:59.480 --> 2:57:04.040]  Veritas. Godspeed. Great job. I can't wait to see what you guys break next.
[2:57:04.040 --> 2:57:09.800]  Thank you, Alex. Appreciate it. All right. We've got another medical doctor expert on
[2:57:09.800 --> 2:57:15.240]  the vaccine and on the psychological warfare. He's also a psychiatrist coming up to host
[2:57:15.240 --> 2:57:20.360]  the next hour. But I've got the big news. This is the next leg of the witch hunt. We'll
[2:57:20.360 --> 2:57:27.560]  put it on screen when we come back. It's from Gateway Pundit, but it's from the press release.
[2:57:27.560 --> 2:57:36.880]  The request of the January 6th committee is my communications with Republican leaders.
[2:57:36.880 --> 2:57:41.800]  So I mean, we knew they wanted this. The FBI wants this. They arrested Ellen for it. So
[2:57:41.800 --> 2:57:47.520]  let me give them the newsflash. There are no communications.
[2:57:47.520 --> 2:57:52.760]  Humanity is the main stakeholder on this planet. But the big corporations for 100 years have
[2:57:52.760 --> 2:57:56.440]  told us that humans are bad and evil and the pestilence on the earth so that we begin to
[2:57:56.440 --> 2:58:01.400]  believe we're bad and we'll turn off our life force and let the eugenics based globalists
[2:58:01.400 --> 2:58:06.800]  take control of the planet. If you let a clown swab the evidence groups own Wikipedia page,
[2:58:06.800 --> 2:58:12.520]  he brags on there about how they're capturing democracy and taking over governments worldwide
[2:58:12.520 --> 2:58:18.040]  to set up corporate dictatorship under the U.N. They admit all of this. They plan the
[2:58:18.040 --> 2:58:23.320]  lockdowns. They release the viruses. They think you're stupid and their plan is to slowly
[2:58:23.320 --> 2:58:28.440]  cut off the resources so they can dictate total social control over you and your lives.
[2:58:28.440 --> 2:58:34.360]  That's how I was able to predict everything they did decades before they executed it.
[2:58:34.360 --> 2:58:39.360]  They did it for word with total precision because they have a detailed battle plan.
[2:58:39.360 --> 2:58:44.600]  We cover it live weekdays. 11 a.m. is 3 p.m. at infowars.com for a slice show. Tell everybody
[2:58:44.600 --> 2:58:50.480]  to tune in now and war the world. So when I first started taking survival
[2:58:50.480 --> 2:58:55.680]  skills, basically I was 275 pounds overweight. I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[2:58:55.680 --> 2:59:00.240]  I was barely holding onto a job and I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[2:59:00.240 --> 2:59:04.800]  The first one I got was the original survival shield, the X1. And it worked pretty good.
[2:59:04.800 --> 2:59:08.960]  And then shortly thereafter you came out with X2. You had with a deep burdened source and
[2:59:08.960 --> 2:59:13.880]  I got really excited about that so I took it. And then in two weeks I went from brain fog
[2:59:13.880 --> 2:59:19.520]  to like literally like my brain was enlightened. I could think again. I could connect with
[2:59:19.520 --> 2:59:24.400]  people again. And over the course of the next couple of years I got my health back and I
[2:59:24.400 --> 2:59:28.960]  religiously take basically all of your supplements. They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[2:59:28.960 --> 2:59:33.320]  The one I like recently is knock out literally like if you want to sleep just take it. It's
[2:59:33.320 --> 2:59:37.120]  amazing. It works. But anyway so the point is we have to get ourselves clean. We have
[2:59:37.120 --> 2:59:41.560]  to break free of the globalist system and the only way to do that is to take our own
[2:59:41.560 --> 2:59:45.640]  health into our own hands. Beautifully said brother. I thank you so much for your call
[2:59:45.640 --> 3:00:09.640]  and Godspeed.
[3:00:09.640 --> 3:00:18.440]  So when they arrested Owen Schreuer they wanted to know who he was talking to. Those weren't
[3:00:18.440 --> 3:00:22.480]  such a free country. And they want to know you know you're talking to Congress or you're
[3:00:22.480 --> 3:00:27.080]  talking to and I said that's what this is all about. It's about the January 6th ongoing
[3:00:27.080 --> 3:00:33.000]  wedge hunt. Well now we know Pelosi's putting out these congressional subpoenas of the Trump
[3:00:33.000 --> 3:00:38.600]  administration. Well that's the executive and the legislative. You don't do that. January
[3:00:38.600 --> 3:00:44.080]  6th committee requests communications between Trump White House officials and top conservatives
[3:00:44.080 --> 3:00:52.480]  including reporter Jack Pesobic Scott Pressler Alex Jones brand of Stratka you name it and
[3:00:52.480 --> 3:00:58.200]  Pesobic's got a great point here. Jack Pesobic responded this is completely illegal and my
[3:00:58.200 --> 3:01:03.720]  lawyers will make short work of it. These ugly communists want to go full Stalin and
[3:01:03.720 --> 3:01:09.960]  Gestapo as they flail about to distract from the failures of the dementia patient they
[3:01:09.960 --> 3:01:16.920]  have as a president who even Obama called a f up be cautious. Yeah so I'm sitting there
[3:01:16.920 --> 3:01:23.400]  to the FBI through my lawyers going OK you want my communications with Republican leaders
[3:01:23.400 --> 3:01:28.440]  drop your charges because there are none. But at the same time I guess Pesobic's right
[3:01:28.440 --> 3:01:34.560]  we shouldn't be giving them that. We're journalists and that's a big huge thing now. Owen would
[3:01:34.560 --> 3:01:38.560]  not bullhorn once we got to the Capitol. He wanted to be a journalist when he was there
[3:01:38.560 --> 3:01:42.840]  for a lot of reasons but also he had that non prosecution agreement but then arrested
[3:01:42.840 --> 3:01:48.120]  him for saying something to Nadler in the Capitol. The left could do that all day. We can. But
[3:01:48.120 --> 3:01:52.640]  he really was there as a journalist that day. So here's the big national Washington Post
[3:01:52.640 --> 3:01:57.120]  New York Times. They all have headlines. Judge wants Justice Department to detail decision
[3:01:57.120 --> 3:02:03.320]  on charging Info Wars correspondent accused of January 6 riot. Info Wars host case. Judge
[3:02:03.320 --> 3:02:11.800]  calls out Biden DOJ for investigating media. That's Newsmax. The southern one was Washington
[3:02:11.800 --> 3:02:18.760]  Post. Judge questions DOJ media policy in case Capitol riot against Info Wars host Wall
[3:02:18.760 --> 3:02:24.440]  Street Journal. I mean you get now big this is folks. Info Wars host Owen Schreuer released
[3:02:24.440 --> 3:02:29.040]  after turning himself into FBI political persecution is now happening on a mass scale and it goes
[3:02:29.040 --> 3:02:36.320]  on and on. Here's one out of the raw story calling for my wife's arrest because she was
[3:02:36.320 --> 3:02:42.360]  outside the Capitol. I mean this is we think that scares me like now you want to arrest
[3:02:42.360 --> 3:02:48.640]  my wife. I mean it's just you guys are bad. You're bad people. You run a bunch of child
[3:02:48.640 --> 3:02:53.280]  molestation rings. You're devil worshipers. You ship fentanyl into the country. The government
[3:02:53.280 --> 3:02:59.440]  is bankrupt. It's out of control. I'm not at war with it. I want you to leave me alone.
[3:02:59.440 --> 3:03:02.360]  But you're not. You're going to collapse the border. You're going to bring in the kidnap
[3:03:02.360 --> 3:03:06.800]  kids. You're going to devalue the dollar. You're not going to stop because you're crazy
[3:03:06.800 --> 3:03:16.000]  people. You're not going to stop till you've run us in the ground. So there you go. They're
[3:03:16.000 --> 3:03:20.920]  talking about having us testify. You know I've never testified to Congress. I get to
[3:03:20.920 --> 3:03:26.520]  sit there and watch them attack me in hearings when I'm in the room and I never get a chance.
[3:03:26.520 --> 3:03:30.280]  But their plan is to then say I lied to Congress and arrest me like Roger Stone even though
[3:03:30.280 --> 3:03:36.520]  I wouldn't tell a lie. They would just misrepresent it. So you can't polish a turd. You just get
[3:03:36.520 --> 3:03:42.800]  crap on you. But pray for Owen. Pray for info wars and keep us on the air and realize they
[3:03:42.800 --> 3:03:47.080]  want to software because we're exposing their criminal activities. So tell everybody to
[3:03:47.080 --> 3:03:51.560]  tune in. If you're listening on local radio station or watching on TV station or watching
[3:03:51.560 --> 3:03:57.800]  us at man.video or free world news.tv. Just realize you're everything when you get excited
[3:03:57.800 --> 3:04:02.240]  and when you decide to take the links to whatever videos or articles or live feeds you think
[3:04:02.240 --> 3:04:06.400]  are the most informative and when you decide to get excited and tell others hey here's
[3:04:06.400 --> 3:04:12.560]  the forbidden verboten information. If you think it's interesting it deserves to be seen
[3:04:12.560 --> 3:04:17.880]  you should share it and then tell others to share it and then tell them to share it and
[3:04:17.880 --> 3:04:24.800]  then tell them to share it and then tell them to share it and that's called a chain reaction
[3:04:24.800 --> 3:04:30.800]  and that's what the tyrants don't want is a human chain reaction of love and justice
[3:04:30.800 --> 3:04:38.240]  and renaissance and freedom and coming together against this neo fascist neo liberal crazy
[3:04:38.240 --> 3:04:44.240]  town orgy of corporations using behavioral psychology on us and wrecking society in the
[3:04:44.240 --> 3:04:48.480]  process because they're like Hitler using nerve gas and World War one. He thinks he's
[3:04:48.480 --> 3:04:52.320]  invincible it blows back on him. Nobody can do stuff like this and not have to destroy
[3:04:52.320 --> 3:04:55.600]  them. All right. We have a special guest taken over straight away. There'll be big news in
[3:04:55.600 --> 3:05:02.160]  the war room to do on the war room today. Not all vitamin and mineral supplements are
[3:05:02.160 --> 3:05:06.520]  equal. Many of them are synthetic. Many of them have fillers and additives. Many of them
[3:05:06.520 --> 3:05:11.600]  just pass right through the body and are absorbed. But that's not the case with our incredibly
[3:05:11.600 --> 3:05:15.960]  popular because it's so effective product that has now been sold out for months. But
[3:05:15.960 --> 3:05:22.240]  it's finally back in stone. That is vitamin, mineral fusion, all the essential vitamins,
[3:05:22.240 --> 3:05:26.240]  all the essential minerals, a bunch of key amino acids to help it upload better into
[3:05:26.240 --> 3:05:30.760]  your body and your cells. It's in powder form. It's great for children. It's great for adults.
[3:05:30.760 --> 3:05:34.720]  It's really important for folks that are older because they don't absorb as well through
[3:05:34.720 --> 3:05:39.520]  their guts. This liquid formula really, really does it. You mix up a picture of it every

[3:06:15.960 --> 3:06:25.440]  show. Hello, and welcome to the Alex Jones show. I'm your host of the fourth hour, Dr.
[3:06:25.440 --> 3:06:31.320]  Andrew Kaufman, and I have a very interesting show today with an interesting guest. If we
[3:06:31.320 --> 3:06:36.680]  can get our technical challenges worked out. And as advertised today, I'm going to talk
[3:06:36.680 --> 3:06:42.880]  to you about the psychological aspects of what's been going on with the pandemic situation.
[3:06:42.880 --> 3:06:49.240]  And we've entitled the show COVID gnosis, how empire has brainwashed the world. And
[3:06:49.240 --> 3:06:55.120]  I want to bring up, first of all, that there are many names used to describe this process
[3:06:55.120 --> 3:07:03.440]  including mass psychosis, mass hypnosis, mass formation, crowd formation, etc. But what
[3:07:03.440 --> 3:07:10.080]  I'm really talking about is how you can march a society towards a totalitarian state. And
[3:07:10.080 --> 3:07:16.160]  of course, we've seen many examples of this in the 20th century so far to learn from.
[3:07:16.160 --> 3:07:22.600]  And overall, there are two main techniques that one can use. And the first we've seen
[3:07:22.600 --> 3:07:27.360]  implemented in some of those totalitarian states over the 20th century. And what I'm
[3:07:27.360 --> 3:07:34.320]  talking about is using brute force threats, intimidation, silencing people, murdering
[3:07:34.320 --> 3:07:43.080]  people, preventing resources to essentially by force, take control of a society. And then
[3:07:43.080 --> 3:07:50.240]  you have the countervening approach, which is to establish a situation to obtain consent
[3:07:50.240 --> 3:07:56.840]  over society. And this is what I think is going on right now in our current situation.
[3:07:56.840 --> 3:08:03.600]  And we can look at two famous literary examples to highlight this contrast in approach. The
[3:08:03.600 --> 3:08:10.360]  first example would be 1984 by George Orwell. And in this example, we see, you know, the
[3:08:10.360 --> 3:08:17.280]  famous quote about a boot being permanently on the face of the citizen who is the subject
[3:08:17.280 --> 3:08:23.940]  of this tyranny. So we can see that through the use of torture and force and endless war,
[3:08:23.940 --> 3:08:29.120]  you can achieve this type of control over the members of society. And then we have a
[3:08:29.120 --> 3:08:35.720]  very different type of dystopian future that's presented in Aldous Huxley's Brave New World.
[3:08:35.720 --> 3:08:40.640]  And Aldous Huxley really is an important figure to look at in what is going on in the world
[3:08:40.640 --> 3:08:48.720]  today because he predicted that this would be occurring and kind of laid it out in advance
[3:08:48.720 --> 3:08:54.800]  for us. So there are many, many lessons to be learned and warnings to be heeded about
[3:08:54.800 --> 3:09:01.920]  what's going on. But essentially, the dystopian society we see in a Brave New World is one
[3:09:01.920 --> 3:09:10.080]  where people participate willingly. And they use various methods of providing pleasure
[3:09:10.080 --> 3:09:15.840]  and distraction to the members of the society in order to keep them content and compliance
[3:09:15.840 --> 3:09:21.640]  without having any of the normal freedoms that they would have. And this plays out one
[3:09:21.640 --> 3:09:28.360]  through the use of a drug in the book called soma, which essentially induces a happy,
[3:09:28.360 --> 3:09:34.800]  distracted state. So if you're experiencing the loss over a sense of identity or purpose
[3:09:34.800 --> 3:09:41.280]  in life or feeling that something is stressful about the repetition, then taking that drug
[3:09:41.280 --> 3:09:48.120]  is encouraged. And this makes you essentially happy enough and satisfied enough that you
[3:09:48.120 --> 3:09:54.000]  don't question things further. And of course, we see that that society also was stratified
[3:09:54.000 --> 3:09:59.480]  as presented in that image into different groups named after, interestingly, Greek letters
[3:09:59.480 --> 3:10:07.880]  similar to the fake variants that we're seeing now paraded as signs of danger. And of course,
[3:10:07.880 --> 3:10:14.720]  people were brainwashed from birth. And also in this depiction, children were not created
[3:10:14.720 --> 3:10:20.920]  through families or marriage. And in fact, they totally separated that and taught young
[3:10:20.920 --> 3:10:26.440]  children and infants through various brainwashing techniques that families and birthing were
[3:10:26.440 --> 3:10:31.960]  things that were gross and unnatural. And they engineered their babies to be born in
[3:10:31.960 --> 3:10:38.360]  a factory and have certain characteristics that were desired by the leaders, similarly
[3:10:38.360 --> 3:10:45.320]  to how livestock are bred for specific character traits that make them easier to control or
[3:10:45.320 --> 3:10:50.680]  better at getting their job done in that context.
[3:10:50.680 --> 3:10:59.160]  So what I'm going to talk about in the topic for today's show is about how can the governments
[3:10:59.160 --> 3:11:06.520]  of the world or the empirical organizations of the world actually manipulate the psyche
[3:11:06.520 --> 3:11:14.480]  of the people en masse towards this willingness to accept a totalitarian state and willingness
[3:11:14.480 --> 3:11:20.560]  to give up their freedoms. And there seems to be a universal exchange that goes on here
[3:11:20.560 --> 3:11:28.560]  related to safety and the emotion of fear. And so when people are in a state of fear,
[3:11:28.560 --> 3:11:33.640]  they're willing to trade their freedom for safety. And we've seen this happen over and
[3:11:33.640 --> 3:11:39.800]  over again historically. And this is exploited and known to be a very important technique.
[3:11:39.800 --> 3:11:45.520]  So if we could pull up the first slide, because I want to talk about in the UK government,
[3:11:45.520 --> 3:11:54.920]  they have actually created a group that strategically creates ways to increase and generate fear
[3:11:54.920 --> 3:12:02.200]  in the population. And what I'm talking about here is a group called the Scientific Pandemic
[3:12:02.200 --> 3:12:11.480]  Influenza Group on Behavior or SPI-B. And they were reconvened on February 13th of 2020
[3:12:11.480 --> 3:12:18.880]  as a group. They were previously in place during the swine flu pandemic of 2010, I believe,
[3:12:18.880 --> 3:12:23.760]  which we know has been completely debunked at this time. But they reconvened in order
[3:12:23.760 --> 3:12:32.320]  to provide recommendations to the UK government how to increase compliance with various interventions
[3:12:32.320 --> 3:12:39.280]  and policies such as lockdown, social distancing, mask wearing, and ultimately toward the vaccine
[3:12:39.280 --> 3:12:45.960]  and the vaccine passports. And what we found is that several psychologists who are on this
[3:12:45.960 --> 3:12:52.520]  group decided to blow the whistle. And that's what we see in that Telegraph article, where
[3:12:52.520 --> 3:12:59.280]  they essentially realized that what they were doing was unethical and immoral. And I want
[3:12:59.280 --> 3:13:05.640]  to quote one of the psychiatrists who not only came out to the newspaper and the Telegraph
[3:13:05.640 --> 3:13:13.240]  but actually was interviewed for a very important book that describes this in detail. And I'm
[3:13:13.240 --> 3:13:17.480]  sorry, I'm giving you the title of this book in just a minute. But let me read you the
[3:13:17.480 --> 3:13:25.080]  quote and this is from Gavin Morgan is the name of the psychologist. And he stated, clearly,
[3:13:25.080 --> 3:13:32.760]  using fear as a means of control is not ethical. Using fear smacks of totalitarianism. It's
[3:13:32.760 --> 3:13:38.760]  not an ethical stance for any modern government. By nature, I'm an optimistic person. But all
[3:13:38.760 --> 3:13:45.400]  this has given me a more pessimistic view of people. And there were several other whistleblowers
[3:13:45.400 --> 3:13:49.840]  that contributed and with similar sentiments. And essentially what we're saying here is
[3:13:49.840 --> 3:13:58.560]  that there is a government dictated strategy to generate fear among their population in
[3:13:58.560 --> 3:14:04.480]  order that they will trade that fear for safety and go along and be compliant with all of
[3:14:04.480 --> 3:14:09.280]  these measures that are not in their best interest, even when these measures result
[3:14:09.280 --> 3:14:18.160]  in direct harm to themselves, economic harm, social harm, etc. And this brings me to discussing
[3:14:18.160 --> 3:14:25.920]  more general what is the overall technique to prepare a population in order to be manipulated
[3:14:25.920 --> 3:14:32.720]  with the hypnotic techniques that my guest is going to describe coming up. And there
[3:14:32.720 --> 3:14:37.760]  seem to be three facets that are talked about in much of the literature. And you can find
[3:14:37.760 --> 3:14:43.720]  this in the writings of Mir Lu, as well as Jacques Elul, who wrote on propaganda. And
[3:14:43.720 --> 3:14:50.600]  more recently, there's a professor of psychology who was interviewed by Reiner Fulmisch. I
[3:14:50.600 --> 3:14:56.720]  believe the name is Mespef, who talked about this. And these three conditions are firstly
[3:14:56.720 --> 3:15:05.680]  isolation. And this is really important to cut people off from their normal social contacts.
[3:15:05.680 --> 3:15:13.160]  The second aspect is create a state of confusion, where there are changing rules and instructions,
[3:15:13.160 --> 3:15:20.480]  repetitive slogans that seep into the conscious awareness. And the third aspect is to create
[3:15:20.480 --> 3:15:29.360]  a general state of dysphoria or anxiety or disenfranchisement among the people, and especially
[3:15:29.360 --> 3:15:34.160]  if it's a general state and doesn't have a specific cause. Because then you're able
[3:15:34.160 --> 3:15:41.040]  to introduce a cause of this distress along with a strategic solution, which fits what
[3:15:41.040 --> 3:15:47.200]  the government or the leaders want. And this can also be described as the Hegelian dialectic.
[3:15:47.200 --> 3:15:50.640]  So when we come back after the break, we're going to get into some more detail about these
[3:15:50.640 --> 3:15:55.800]  techniques and hopefully meet with our guest and talk more about hypnosis. So we'll be
[3:15:55.800 --> 3:15:57.720]  right back after this message.
[3:15:57.720 --> 3:16:01.800]  What if you could cut your heating bills this winter with your existing wood-burning fireplace

[3:17:27.720 --> 3:17:31.760]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize
[3:17:31.760 --> 3:17:36.320]  my mother's house. I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating
[3:17:36.320 --> 3:17:40.360]  them ever since. I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people
[3:17:40.360 --> 3:17:44.400]  deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved. I can help you too. If you owe
[3:17:44.400 --> 3:17:49.440]  taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day. There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[3:17:49.440 --> 3:17:58.880]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[3:17:58.880 --> 3:18:03.760]  Not all vitamin and mineral supplements are equal. Many of them are synthetic. Many of
[3:18:03.760 --> 3:18:08.280]  them have fillers and additives. Many of them just pass right to the body and are not absorbed.
[3:18:08.280 --> 3:18:13.440]  Well, that's not the case with our incredibly popular because it's so effective product
[3:18:13.440 --> 3:18:18.960]  that it's now been sold out for months but it's finally back in stone. And that is vitamin
[3:18:18.960 --> 3:18:23.640]  mineral fusion. All the essential vitamins, all the essential minerals, a bunch of keomino
[3:18:23.640 --> 3:18:28.480]  acids to help it upload better into your body and your cells. It's in powder form, great
[3:18:28.480 --> 3:18:32.560]  for children, it's great for adults, it's really important for folks that are older

[3:18:58.800 --> 3:19:03.960]  It is through our five senses that we are kept fascinated and hypnotized by the lies
[3:19:03.960 --> 3:19:09.360]  we are told. And the only way to see through this illusion is with our higher senses, which
[3:19:09.360 --> 3:19:14.900]  is why fluoridated water is a big problem. Consuming too much fluoride forms phosphate
[3:19:14.900 --> 3:19:20.400]  crystals around the pineal gland and shuts down its natural functions. Natural functions
[3:19:20.400 --> 3:19:25.320]  which have been known for millennia. The Hindu chakras align with the endocrine system.
[3:19:25.320 --> 3:19:30.520]  The chakra aligned with the pineal gland is the third eye. Also described as the seat
[3:19:30.520 --> 3:19:36.600]  of the soul. The pineal gland is what connects us to higher levels of consciousness and otherwise
[3:19:36.600 --> 3:19:42.800]  unseen dimensions of reality. Fluoride free water is essential to keeping our pineal gland
[3:19:42.800 --> 3:19:48.360]  healthy. Our water filtration systems with the proper filters will keep your drinking
[3:19:48.360 --> 3:19:54.080]  water fluoride free and the pro pure shower head will seal the deal. Get them both today

[3:20:07.560 --> 3:20:22.720]  Hello and welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm your host for this fourth hour, Dr. Andrew
[3:20:22.720 --> 3:20:29.120]  Kaufman. I want to remind people or essentially announce that I will be doing a live webinar
[3:20:29.120 --> 3:20:37.840]  this Saturday, the 28th. And you can find out more about that on truemedicinelibrary.com.
[3:20:37.840 --> 3:20:42.880]  Sorry about that. That is will be the inaugural live webinar and it will be all question and
[3:20:42.880 --> 3:20:49.160]  answers about any topics related to the science of the pandemic as well as natural healing.
[3:20:49.160 --> 3:20:54.920]  So I hope to see some of you there. Before the break, I was talking about mass hypnosis
[3:20:54.920 --> 3:21:02.120]  of our society in a way to get people to consent to the totalitarian takeover of our collective
[3:21:02.120 --> 3:21:09.600]  population. And I want to just point out two things before I introduce my guest who's
[3:21:09.600 --> 3:21:16.360]  an expert in this area. And if we could bring up the slide on the TV, because television
[3:21:16.360 --> 3:21:21.960]  plays a central role in the mass media in the ability to manipulate society. And we
[3:21:21.960 --> 3:21:29.680]  can see from the studies of Krugman in the 1960s that television actually puts the viewer
[3:21:29.680 --> 3:21:38.400]  into an alpha brainwave state. And what this means is that they are open to hypnotic suggestion.
[3:21:38.400 --> 3:21:43.600]  And the programming that follows coming from only a few companies who repeat the same messages
[3:21:43.600 --> 3:21:50.840]  over and over again is taken in much more saliently because of this hypnotic state.
[3:21:50.840 --> 3:21:55.560]  And if we could go to the next slide, please. I also want to point out that hypnosis is
[3:21:55.560 --> 3:22:02.000]  quite a powerful technique. In fact, it's so powerful that when someone is under hypnosis
[3:22:02.000 --> 3:22:07.600]  that you can cut into their flesh with a knife like through a surgical procedure and they
[3:22:07.600 --> 3:22:12.720]  will not feel it. And they've actually done hundreds of surgical procedures only with
[3:22:12.720 --> 3:22:19.280]  hypnosis and no other anesthesia. So now that I've set the stage, I'd like to introduce
[3:22:19.280 --> 3:22:27.120]  today's guest, Michael Grady, who is a professional hypnotist and stage hypnotist and also does
[3:22:27.120 --> 3:22:32.440]  therapy with people using neurolinguistic programming. So Michael, welcome to the Alex
[3:22:32.440 --> 3:22:38.440]  Jones show. Hi, Annie. Thanks for having me on. Pleasure to be here. Great for you. Thank
[3:22:38.440 --> 3:22:45.640]  you so much. And, you know, we should be able to conclude that many hypnotists or people
[3:22:45.640 --> 3:22:51.000]  with your expertise should see what's going on right now. But you are the only one of
[3:22:51.000 --> 3:22:55.800]  the very few who is speaking out about this. So can you tell the audience? How did you
[3:22:55.800 --> 3:23:02.800]  come to, you know, be sort of a whistleblower or talk about this controversial topic?
[3:23:02.800 --> 3:23:09.080]  Honestly, I did not even plan on doing this, you know, for many years, I've been sharing
[3:23:09.080 --> 3:23:13.000]  this information with my followers, family and friends. And it's just been so hard for
[3:23:13.000 --> 3:23:19.960]  everybody to see that no one ever really wanted to listen to it, right? Like, so once I saw
[3:23:19.960 --> 3:23:25.760]  this cartoon that the Los Angeles Unified District put out, and it was so blatantly
[3:23:25.760 --> 3:23:30.160]  obvious, I think some of us have seen it, it induces a guilt trip into the kids and
[3:23:30.160 --> 3:23:35.920]  it's a lot of hypnotic elements into it. So many hypnotic elements, and it took me
[3:23:35.920 --> 3:23:45.440]  20 minutes to describe a clip of Barbara. It took me 20 minutes to describe just some
[3:23:45.440 --> 3:23:53.760]  of the elements in this cartoon that we later found out the school district hired an infomercial
[3:23:53.760 --> 3:23:59.480]  giant behind the George Foreman Grill, the Juice Man juicer, Nordic Track and a bunch
[3:23:59.480 --> 3:24:05.480]  of other mega successful products. So it's kind of hinting, is this a product that they're
[3:24:05.480 --> 3:24:09.120]  selling or are they trying to help the kids be safe, right?
[3:24:09.120 --> 3:24:14.920]  Right. And clearly they're using, you know, the strongest marketing type of strategy.
[3:24:14.920 --> 3:24:20.280]  So were you saying that really the techniques of hypnosis are actually applied to marketing
[3:24:20.280 --> 3:24:24.200]  and advertising for commercial purposes as well?
[3:24:24.200 --> 3:24:31.160]  Oh my goodness, absolutely. You talk to any salesman, you know, you'll know that anytime
[3:24:31.160 --> 3:24:35.440]  they make a sale, they have to have a rapport with the customer. They have to be a place
[3:24:35.440 --> 3:24:40.360]  of authority. They have to be an expert of some sort to gain that trust, right? And the
[3:24:40.360 --> 3:24:45.880]  same goes for hypnosis. When I go on stage to do a show or I do therapy with somebody,
[3:24:45.880 --> 3:24:49.280]  they need to know that I'm the real deal and I know what I'm talking about. So there's
[3:24:49.280 --> 3:24:56.800]  ways to demonstrate that. And, you know, I could go on and on. There's so many aspects
[3:24:56.800 --> 3:25:03.240]  to sales and hypnosis, accepting an idea, being sold something. It's really one and
[3:25:03.240 --> 3:25:04.240]  the same.
[3:25:04.240 --> 3:25:10.640]  Well, Michael, why don't you help us out perhaps by laying out some of the principles or techniques
[3:25:10.640 --> 3:25:15.440]  used with hypnotic suggestion that you've seen applied here. And then perhaps during
[3:25:15.440 --> 3:25:18.160]  the next segment, we can show some examples.
[3:25:18.160 --> 3:25:25.080]  Right. So one of the biggest hypnotic concepts everyone needs to know that's being used on
[3:25:25.080 --> 3:25:32.320]  us in the media and with anybody who can be manipulative, really, is, you know, we have
[3:25:32.320 --> 3:25:37.840]  this, this chart here that us, us hypnotists use. We have the conscious mind, the subconscious
[3:25:37.840 --> 3:25:43.480]  mind and the critical factor, right, which is the gateway into the subconscious mind.
[3:25:43.480 --> 3:25:49.880]  Now anytime you feel an emotion, that is an unconscious response. Right. So if someone
[3:25:49.880 --> 3:25:57.160]  gets you to feel fear, right, worry, that means that you are believing it. Right. And
[3:25:57.160 --> 3:26:02.680]  so that also means that your critical factor, the gateway to the subconscious mind opens.
[3:26:02.680 --> 3:26:06.960]  And so after they induce you with some kind of scary image, like in the beginning of the
[3:26:06.960 --> 3:26:11.800]  pandemic, when we had the people fainting, right, and we realized that, you know, that
[3:26:11.800 --> 3:26:16.840]  actually didn't happen, but those were scary images. Right. They got fear into people.
[3:26:16.840 --> 3:26:25.400]  And so they're very persuasive, edited videos from the point you feel fear all the way through
[3:26:25.400 --> 3:26:30.360]  the segment, you just accept those suggestions straight to your subconscious mind. And then
[3:26:30.360 --> 3:26:36.280]  it's no surprise when we talk to everybody who's in the COVID gnosis, right. It's all
[3:26:36.280 --> 3:26:41.920]  the same set responses. Right. Over and over. It's like I'm on the, like I'm on the stage
[3:26:41.920 --> 3:26:46.080]  at the hypnosis show and I'm going up to the microphone with the microphone. And, you know,
[3:26:46.080 --> 3:26:53.240]  it's all the same responses, very, very predictable. Right. And we saw this with Mark Dice when
[3:26:53.240 --> 3:26:57.560]  he went up to people with the petition, you know, sign the petition and incarcerate anti
[3:26:57.560 --> 3:27:02.680]  vaxxers, you know, and people are just like, yeah, okay. Right. And I'm like, this is like
[3:27:02.680 --> 3:27:09.840]  a hypnotic skate skit. Right. That's right. Because the anti vaxxers have been specifically
[3:27:09.840 --> 3:27:16.160]  labeled among domestic terrorism documents. Right. If there's a guidance from FEMA that
[3:27:16.160 --> 3:27:21.080]  lists this specifically, but I think you make a very important point for psychology, which
[3:27:21.080 --> 3:27:27.040]  is when you can induce someone into a feeling state like fear that the natural way that
[3:27:27.040 --> 3:27:32.280]  our mind works is it wants to find thoughts that explain that fear response. Like it's
[3:27:32.280 --> 3:27:38.600]  looking for a source of danger if you feel fear. And whatever is presented to you, right,
[3:27:38.600 --> 3:27:43.920]  like, you know, through a mass media message is going to be incorporated into your belief
[3:27:43.920 --> 3:27:48.400]  system. And then you'll, especially through repetition, right? I mean, how important is
[3:27:48.400 --> 3:27:56.240]  repetition for the hypnotic process? It's very important. Here's the power of what
[3:27:56.240 --> 3:28:02.320]  they've been able to do. Okay. So they've been indoctrinating us heavily just on this
[3:28:02.320 --> 3:28:09.160]  one topic for what over 500 days, right? A year and a half. And so what happens is when
[3:28:09.160 --> 3:28:13.560]  you put an idea into the subconscious mind, it kind of gets planted like a seed, right?
[3:28:13.560 --> 3:28:19.960]  And it grows and we call these pillars of belief once they really do hold. And so imagine
[3:28:19.960 --> 3:28:25.720]  the person who's been watching the news every day, many times a week, you know, throughout
[3:28:25.720 --> 3:28:30.100]  this whole time, they have a pillar, pillar, pillar, pillar, pillar, they have hundreds
[3:28:30.100 --> 3:28:34.760]  of pillars holding up this concept of the convid. And so, you know, you go up to talk
[3:28:34.760 --> 3:28:39.480]  to them with a little fact from Mary, the CDC said this or OSHA says that about masks
[3:28:39.480 --> 3:28:47.240]  or any kind of real bit of information. They just can't accept it, right? It's like when
[3:28:47.240 --> 3:28:51.400]  I have someone up on stage and we do, you know, us hypnotists, we do the routine of
[3:28:51.400 --> 3:28:55.960]  like, you know, one of the stars of the show, they couldn't say their name and eat.
[3:28:55.960 --> 3:29:01.120]  Michael, this is a very powerful. Listeners call into the show and they thank me. And it
[3:29:01.120 --> 3:29:07.440]  makes me feel pathetic because I sit there and I beg you for support constantly for prayer,
[3:29:07.440 --> 3:29:12.280]  for financial support, and for word of mouth. And we're all this together. And I, you know,
[3:29:12.280 --> 3:29:15.760]  it gets old having to come to you and say, Hey, I got great products, please bomb or
[3:29:15.760 --> 3:29:19.640]  we won't be here on air. But it's true. We're the only media organization in the United States
[3:29:19.640 --> 3:29:24.320]  that promotes liberty at this level that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors. And
[3:29:24.320 --> 3:29:28.160]  they've harassed and almost shut down everybody else. They crippled all the other groups and
[3:29:28.160 --> 3:29:32.800]  we're still here. And as this whole new world order comes out and be open, our credibility
[3:29:32.800 --> 3:29:36.560]  is going up. That's why we've got to be taken off air. That's why America has got to be
[3:29:36.560 --> 3:29:41.560]  taken down. You can't have all these other nations enslaved and America still quasi free.
[3:29:41.560 --> 3:29:45.760]  You can't have info wars has been proven right. Be on air with all the craziness that's about
[3:29:45.760 --> 3:29:50.160]  to unfold. Because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready. So thank you all and

[3:30:08.120 --> 3:30:12.240]  our neck. The big globalist publications are coming after us and they're doing everything

[3:30:58.080 --> 3:31:04.000]  Thank you so much. Let's go back in time say to the mid 1990s and then imagine a science
[3:31:04.000 --> 3:31:08.800]  fiction movie set in the year 2020 where a world government's being established where
[3:31:08.800 --> 3:31:13.360]  members of Congress and former presidents are censured by big tech and where if you don't
[3:31:13.360 --> 3:31:19.200]  take an experimental injection that grows blood plots and prions all over your body,
[3:31:19.200 --> 3:31:26.120]  then you're not allowed to fly on an airplane. Think about that because that's where we are.
[3:31:26.120 --> 3:31:31.080]  Imagine just 20, 30 years ago, tell just five years ago that somebody told you this would
[3:31:31.080 --> 3:31:36.200]  be happening, but it is happening now. And then they tell you, oh, sorry, it's out of
[3:31:36.200 --> 3:31:40.920]  vaccine is a gene therapy and it doesn't really work. She got to take it every few months
[3:31:40.920 --> 3:31:45.240]  and the people that have submitted say, great, I want to take it all the time so I can go
[3:31:45.240 --> 3:31:49.160]  outside and not get sick from COVID. Even though it gets you sick from COVID. And now
[3:31:49.160 --> 3:31:53.800]  there's record numbers of really sick people from the sloughing, the shedding of the virus
[3:31:53.800 --> 3:31:58.760]  and that's in mainline studies. Bill Gates and Fauci did this need to go to prison for it right now.
[3:31:58.760 --> 3:32:05.080]  Not all vitamin and mineral supplements are equal. Many of them are synthetic. Many of them have
[3:32:05.080 --> 3:32:09.800]  fillers and additives. Many of them just pass right through the body and are absorbed. But that's
[3:32:09.800 --> 3:32:15.000]  not the case with our incredibly popular because it's so effective product that has now been
[3:32:15.000 --> 3:32:20.760]  sold out for months, but it's finally back in stone. And that is vitamin, mineral fusion,
[3:32:20.760 --> 3:32:25.400]  all the essential vitamins, all the essential minerals, a bunch of QV amino acids to help it
[3:32:25.400 --> 3:32:30.360]  upload better into your body and your cells. It's a powder form. It's great for children. It's great
[3:32:30.360 --> 3:32:35.080]  for adults. It's really important for folks that are older because they don't absorb as well through
[3:32:35.080 --> 3:32:40.040]  their guts. So this liquid formula really, really does it. You mix up a picture of it every couple
[3:32:40.040 --> 3:32:44.280]  days, put it in the refrigerator or keep it out in the kitchen and just remember to drink it in the
[3:32:44.280 --> 3:32:48.840]  morning and in the evening. It tastes great. It makes your body healthy. It boosts your immune
[3:32:48.840 --> 3:32:55.720]  system and it funds the info war. A true 360 wins. So vitamin, mineral fusion sold out for months
[3:32:55.720 --> 3:33:03.240]  is back in stock for a limited time. 33% off info war store. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:03.240 --> 3:33:22.680]  All right. Hello and welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm your host, Dr. Andrew Kaufman. I
[3:33:22.680 --> 3:33:27.720]  have an excellent guest here, professional hypnotist, Michael Grady. And before the break,
[3:33:27.720 --> 3:33:33.880]  we were talking about some techniques of hypnosis that have been applied to the propaganda campaign
[3:33:33.880 --> 3:33:41.240]  in the COVID-19 pandemic. And we talked about the inducement of an emotional state specifically fear
[3:33:41.240 --> 3:33:45.800]  and we talked about repetition. So Michael, what else can you tell us about that you've seen
[3:33:46.840 --> 3:33:56.440]  in the trick of bag of tricks so far this year? Right. So the depth of which someone
[3:33:56.440 --> 3:34:02.040]  makes you feel an emotion is the same depth that they're getting access to your subconscious mind.
[3:34:02.920 --> 3:34:09.320]  Right. That's a really big concept to just like digest and which is why we see everyone
[3:34:09.320 --> 3:34:18.520]  regurgitating the same type of answers as if they are hypnotized. Right. And so one of the big aspects
[3:34:18.520 --> 3:34:23.880]  that got people to go from, oh, maybe this is something I should be fearful about to now I'm
[3:34:23.880 --> 3:34:28.200]  not going to hear information and I'm going to allow experimental medicine to be put on me
[3:34:28.840 --> 3:34:35.000]  is something called something where you're complying really. So the more you comply,
[3:34:35.000 --> 3:34:39.000]  the deeper and the trance you get. Right. It's kind of like when I do street hypnosis,
[3:34:39.000 --> 3:34:43.320]  I can just walk up to somebody, hey, would you like to take part in an imagination experiment
[3:34:43.320 --> 3:34:49.080]  and test your mind? Okay, sure. All right. So I have them imagine magnets in between their hands.
[3:34:49.080 --> 3:34:56.200]  Right. And the feeling, which is similar to an emotion, their hands will slowly touch
[3:34:57.720 --> 3:35:02.600]  as an unconscious response. Then I'll make them have their hands stuck together. Right.
[3:35:02.600 --> 3:35:06.520]  Then I'll make them, they can't bend their arm because they imagine a steel bar.
[3:35:06.520 --> 3:35:11.960]  Then I'll make their hands stuck to their head. Right. Then I'll make them so they can't remember
[3:35:11.960 --> 3:35:18.360]  their name. And that's the point where they reach subnamulism and I can say sleep, they drop,
[3:35:18.360 --> 3:35:25.480]  it's over. Right. It's in the bag. Just because they complied, I exercised their imagination.
[3:35:26.040 --> 3:35:28.840]  They became convinced that what I was saying was real.
[3:35:29.960 --> 3:35:33.640]  When it's not, right, you can bend your arm, you can take your hand off your head.
[3:35:33.640 --> 3:35:39.960]  But, you know, those procedures just hack the mind just like you can get into a computer
[3:35:39.960 --> 3:35:45.720]  behind the firewall, us hypnotists know how to get past the critical factor into your
[3:35:45.720 --> 3:35:51.880]  subconscious mind. And if a guy like me can just do it in 10, 15 minutes to anybody walking down
[3:35:51.880 --> 3:35:56.920]  the street, imagine the billion dollar media complex and all the studies they've been doing.
[3:35:57.640 --> 3:36:03.800]  Right. It really puts it in perspective. Right. Well, they certainly do have the resources and,
[3:36:04.360 --> 3:36:09.720]  you know, they've infiltrated in a systematic way into our collective conscious. And, you know,
[3:36:09.720 --> 3:36:16.440]  I think there's important psychological aspects that accompany why these hypnotic ideas take
[3:36:16.440 --> 3:36:21.960]  such a strong root as you described, because we have the fear situation. If we look at that a
[3:36:21.960 --> 3:36:28.120]  little more closely, there has been a specific cause of the fear, right? That is part of the
[3:36:28.120 --> 3:36:35.720]  main narrative, right? Which is this elusive imaginary virus, right? But if you believe that,
[3:36:35.720 --> 3:36:41.720]  then you have the solution to alleviate that fear has been offered, right? And it's
[3:36:41.720 --> 3:36:47.240]  essentially to comply with the policies. If you wear a mask, if you stay away from people,
[3:36:47.240 --> 3:36:54.440]  if you isolate yourself, if you subject yourself to the experimental jab, then you will be safe
[3:36:54.440 --> 3:37:00.360]  and no longer need to be in fear. And so not only does it reduce the fear and provide that relief,
[3:37:00.360 --> 3:37:07.160]  but now in addition, it makes you part of a new social group or collective.
[3:37:07.880 --> 3:37:15.000]  Whereas you were isolated during the initial onset of fear, now you're part of the group
[3:37:15.000 --> 3:37:21.720]  who are, you know, the virus believers, the people who are following all of the dictates,
[3:37:21.720 --> 3:37:31.880]  right? And you see the almost pride that people have when they display their compliance with
[3:37:31.880 --> 3:37:38.840]  these behaviors. And this is why you see people doing it in situations when it's not even requested,
[3:37:38.840 --> 3:37:44.680]  required, or even makes sense, like when people are driving in a vehicle by themselves, right?
[3:37:44.680 --> 3:37:50.840]  And they're doing this to display that they are part now of this new group and they like being
[3:37:50.840 --> 3:37:56.920]  part of it. And this prevents them from being open to new information, right? And this is kind
[3:37:56.920 --> 3:38:04.280]  of the strength of the hypnosis, right? Yep. Environmental hypnosis, right? Social pressure
[3:38:04.280 --> 3:38:10.120]  is hardwired into us as to get love from people. You know, if you're not accepted by your friends
[3:38:10.120 --> 3:38:15.560]  and family, you lose that feeling of love, right? And most people aren't really strong enough in
[3:38:15.560 --> 3:38:22.520]  themselves to stand up like we do, you know? That's right. And that is a real effect because,
[3:38:22.520 --> 3:38:27.960]  you know, I've faced that in my personal life from friends and family members that they
[3:38:27.960 --> 3:38:33.720]  have really withdrawn because they cannot accept, you know, an alternative viewpoint
[3:38:33.720 --> 3:38:39.400]  because of this emotional attachment and degree, you know, of hypnotic trance state.
[3:38:39.400 --> 3:38:47.080]  Right? And we look at experiments like the Ash experiment, right? A simple kidney garden
[3:38:47.080 --> 3:38:54.200]  display of different sized lines on a piece of paper. And with a group of people that are in
[3:38:54.200 --> 3:39:03.640]  on the experiment and one person to answer, right? The person can't even pick out or after the third,
[3:39:03.640 --> 3:39:11.560]  whether the second or third try, he will tell the wrong answer as far as the length of the
[3:39:11.560 --> 3:39:19.640]  line. I gave a slide for that. We can show it. Yes, the one with the different lines on it.
[3:39:19.640 --> 3:39:24.440]  And, you know, so this is a famous experiment, right? Where the subjects are instructed.
[3:39:25.320 --> 3:39:28.360]  First, they're asked, which is the longest line? Is that correct?
[3:39:28.360 --> 3:39:35.480]  What is the similar line, right? So we have one line on the left side. And then, you know,
[3:39:35.480 --> 3:39:40.520]  obviously the right answer is three, right? But because all the five people, all the people
[3:39:40.520 --> 3:39:46.200]  around him, right, are saying the wrong answer, he will eventually say the wrong answer every time.
[3:39:46.200 --> 3:39:51.000]  Even though it doesn't make sense, he will comply, right? There's also another social
[3:39:51.000 --> 3:39:55.640]  conditioning experiment where there's people sitting in a waiting room with the tone going
[3:39:55.640 --> 3:40:00.520]  off and everybody's in on the experiment that stands up every time the tone goes off
[3:40:00.520 --> 3:40:06.440]  and the person has no clue eventually will start standing. And what's even more amazing
[3:40:06.440 --> 3:40:12.280]  is when new people are introduced to that one person, they will also comply along as well.
[3:40:14.120 --> 3:40:20.760]  Wow. So really this kind of aspect of peer pressure is a very strong, motivating force.
[3:40:20.760 --> 3:40:26.520]  And perhaps you can also tell us about the famous Milgram experiment with this, which is
[3:40:26.520 --> 3:40:33.960]  kind of an even more astonishing example of what people will do under the instructions of authority.
[3:40:35.480 --> 3:40:40.360]  Right. So you have someone just taking part in an experiment where they think they're doing
[3:40:40.360 --> 3:40:45.240]  a learning exercise where we're going to ask this person who's in the other room who has
[3:40:45.240 --> 3:40:50.680]  an electrode on their wrist. And if they get the answer wrong, we're going to shock them, right?
[3:40:50.680 --> 3:40:54.440]  We're going to see if this works, right? But really, the experiment is on the person doing
[3:40:54.440 --> 3:41:00.040]  the shocking. And as the test goes on, they start out with very low voltage, just a little
[3:41:01.320 --> 3:41:08.280]  like a nine-volt battery or something. But then the experiment continues on to over 300 volts,
[3:41:08.280 --> 3:41:14.680]  you know, which could blow the guy's hand off, right? And so just with a person in authority
[3:41:14.680 --> 3:41:18.840]  telling them, no, we need to continue the experiment, continue on. And they're kind of,
[3:41:18.840 --> 3:41:24.040]  you'll look distressed and, all right, I guess I'll keep doing it. While the guy is yelling in
[3:41:24.040 --> 3:41:31.000]  the other room and they can hear him yelling, please stop. Right? Someone, you know, people will
[3:41:31.000 --> 3:41:36.680]  just cower to authority. They'll just do what they're told. This goes back to our school system,
[3:41:36.680 --> 3:41:42.280]  right? If I wanted to hypnotize the nation, I know I got to get into ideas in the subconscious
[3:41:42.280 --> 3:41:47.720]  mind. So if I can make this critical factor very weak, have them regurgitate information instead
[3:41:47.720 --> 3:41:53.080]  of coming their own conclusions, do what they're told by being threatened and coerced without
[3:41:53.080 --> 3:41:58.440]  thinking about it during their developing years, creating the neural pathways and neural nets,
[3:41:58.440 --> 3:42:03.640]  so they're hardwired for the rest of their life, it's going to be easy for a guy like me to tell
[3:42:03.640 --> 3:42:11.080]  people on the news what to do with a script. And everyone just complies. It's really amazing.
[3:42:11.080 --> 3:42:16.600]  You know, Michael, I'm glad you brought up the school training because I've often thought of
[3:42:16.600 --> 3:42:22.520]  the situation where, with fire drills, where, right, suddenly everyone is disrupted from their
[3:42:22.520 --> 3:42:29.320]  activity, no matter what it is. And an authority figure orders them to, you know, really comply
[3:42:29.320 --> 3:42:34.040]  seriously with their behavior, right? They have to be in a single file, be completely silent,
[3:42:34.040 --> 3:42:40.040]  silent and follow every single instruction. And it's like, when we hear the sound of that fire
[3:42:40.040 --> 3:42:45.240]  drill, we jump to attention to behave that way and follow the instructions of authority, right?
[3:42:45.240 --> 3:42:51.080]  And that's the program that has already been initiated. So we will expand more on our discussion
[3:42:51.080 --> 3:43:20.920]  of hypnosis in just a moment when we return to the Alex Jones show. Thank you.

[3:44:48.520 --> 3:45:03.800]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone for beta
[3:45:03.800 --> 3:45:09.160]  testing to operational. The globalists are out in the open with their planetary depopulation
[3:45:09.160 --> 3:45:14.040]  takeover, their robot takeover. But the good news is we've been working and you've been working
[3:45:14.040 --> 3:45:17.800]  and others have been working across the planet for decades to get ready for this,
[3:45:17.800 --> 3:45:22.440]  to be able to find it off. Humanity is strong. We're incredible. And if we're aware of the
[3:45:22.440 --> 3:45:26.520]  attack that's happening, we have a real chance of defeating it. If we ask God for guidance,
[3:45:26.520 --> 3:45:31.080]  we will defeat it. So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is
[3:45:31.080 --> 3:45:35.800]  essential and warning others is absolutely essential. And at the same time, supporting
[3:45:35.800 --> 3:45:40.280]  info wars by buying high quality products to keep us on air is essential because they're great

[3:46:02.520 --> 3:46:06.680]  of them are synthetic. Many of them have fillers and additives. Many of them just pass right to the
[3:46:06.680 --> 3:46:12.840]  body and are absorbed. But that's not the case with our incredibly popular because it's so effective
[3:46:12.840 --> 3:46:18.200]  product that has now been sold out for months. But it's finally back in stone. And that is

[3:47:12.280 --> 3:47:30.520]  All right. Hello and welcome back to the Alex Jones show. And please do join me for my true
[3:47:30.520 --> 3:47:36.440]  medicine live webinar this Saturday. As you just seen up on the screen, it would be great to have
[3:47:36.440 --> 3:47:42.920]  you ask some interesting questions and stimulated discussion about topics like you hear me speak
[3:47:42.920 --> 3:47:49.560]  about on Alex Jones and many others. Today we have been talking about mass hypnosis and how
[3:47:49.560 --> 3:47:55.400]  the elite powers and governments of the world have been manipulating the psychology of the
[3:47:55.400 --> 3:48:03.240]  populations across the world towards a totalitarian state. And I have guest expert professional
[3:48:03.240 --> 3:48:08.200]  hypnotist and neuro linguistic programming practitioner, Michael Grady. Welcome back, Michael.
[3:48:09.560 --> 3:48:12.200]  Thank you. So you made a really great. Okay, go ahead.
[3:48:13.400 --> 3:48:18.760]  No, please take us where you like. I was gonna say you made a really great point,
[3:48:18.760 --> 3:48:23.720]  bringing up the fire drill, right? So you get the sound, you have no critical thought,
[3:48:23.720 --> 3:48:29.880]  you just react immediately go, you know, get in line and follow directions, right? Because you
[3:48:29.880 --> 3:48:37.560]  believe that's going to help you with your safety, right? And so same thing with like the tones, right?
[3:48:37.560 --> 3:48:42.120]  Just like that tone experiment where people would stand just because of the tone going off and seeing
[3:48:42.120 --> 3:48:47.320]  everyone else do it. Well, what happens in between classes at school, right? We hear the bell.
[3:48:49.400 --> 3:48:54.360]  That's right, right? Okay, get up, go to the next class, right? Same kind of thing.
[3:48:54.360 --> 3:49:01.800]  And this is behavioral conditioning also is another way to, you know, describe some of these
[3:49:01.800 --> 3:49:07.480]  things, right? Where you pair a desired stimulus like the sound of a bell with the response to,
[3:49:07.480 --> 3:49:12.920]  you know, stop what you're doing, get up and leave the room, right? And we also know that
[3:49:12.920 --> 3:49:18.760]  behavioral conditioning techniques like this that were, you know, developed by Pavlov as well as
[3:49:18.760 --> 3:49:27.080]  others are much more effective when the subject is in a state of fear, right? So once again,
[3:49:27.080 --> 3:49:33.160]  we have the emotional aspect, right? The last video I just posted a couple of days ago on my
[3:49:33.160 --> 3:49:38.920]  YouTube, definitely find me Michael Grady on YouTube. I'm getting this information out so
[3:49:38.920 --> 3:49:43.160]  people can really understand it. And actually, a lot of people are showing their kids and their
[3:49:43.160 --> 3:49:47.480]  kids are really enjoying it. And now it's like showing the magic trick, right? If I can make a
[3:49:47.480 --> 3:49:54.520]  haker chip disappear in my hands, you're going to be amazed. But then I show you it's just a $5
[3:49:54.520 --> 3:50:00.680]  plastic thumb. Like, oh, that's kind of silly, right? It's kind of the same stuff really. It's
[3:50:00.680 --> 3:50:06.360]  just a psychological trick being played on us continually, you know, throughout all our lives.
[3:50:09.160 --> 3:50:14.760]  Absolutely. And I would, you know, encourage people to look at the work of like John Taylor
[3:50:14.760 --> 3:50:20.600]  Gatto, who talks about this indoctrination program in the compulsory school and how it was
[3:50:20.600 --> 3:50:26.360]  really developed out of the Prussian education system. You know, Prussia is part of what Germany
[3:50:26.360 --> 3:50:32.680]  is now. And they essentially developed this style of education system for the purpose of
[3:50:32.680 --> 3:50:39.000]  preparing their children to be obedient workers and soldiers. So in other words, carrying out the
[3:50:39.000 --> 3:50:44.360]  aims of the government authority and very similar to what we're seeing now with this degree of
[3:50:44.360 --> 3:50:50.280]  compliance that's based on this compulsory socialization and indoctrination strategy.
[3:50:51.880 --> 3:51:01.400]  Right. Like I meant to say was, I just released a video where I showed how the LA school system,
[3:51:01.400 --> 3:51:08.680]  they opened their whole 2021 school year, their opening ceremony was literally they started it
[3:51:08.680 --> 3:51:15.240]  like a funeral, okay? To get used to thinking, okay, you know, think about the people who passed
[3:51:15.240 --> 3:51:20.040]  away, right? And then they had this meeting, they had this funeral wreath in the center of the stage
[3:51:20.040 --> 3:51:26.280]  with the dim lights. And they focused on this funeral wreath for like a minute after they induced
[3:51:26.280 --> 3:51:32.920]  the state of death and grieving. And then they placed this funeral wreath right behind the podium.
[3:51:32.920 --> 3:51:37.080]  So when all the people spit, all the crooked people of the administration are speaking,
[3:51:37.080 --> 3:51:41.880]  there's this feeling of death moving in the background, you and your told me safe for that
[3:51:41.880 --> 3:51:51.000]  to be you. It was the unsaid thing there, which is crazy. It was really striking, you know,
[3:51:51.000 --> 3:51:56.440]  the ceremonial aspects of that because they even had a moment of silence. And you know,
[3:51:56.440 --> 3:52:02.280]  I think that this is another aspect. And I know that hypnotic suggestion is part of this, but
[3:52:02.280 --> 3:52:08.120]  we essentially have rituals and ceremonies, right, that are being done. And you can look at the mask
[3:52:08.120 --> 3:52:14.760]  wearing actually as an initiation ritual, right, where the covering of the face de identifies
[3:52:14.760 --> 3:52:20.280]  the person from their previous life. And when they emerge, they'll have a new identity as part of
[3:52:20.280 --> 3:52:26.760]  this new group, right, which is those indoctrinated to COVID, right? And so we have this kind of
[3:52:26.760 --> 3:52:33.320]  thing play out on multiple levels all using these strategies. Right, like in that hypnotic cartoon
[3:52:33.320 --> 3:52:39.080]  that the LA school system hired the infomercial giant to put together, they use specific colors
[3:52:39.080 --> 3:52:43.960]  throughout the whole thing. You can see the little girl, the cartoon girl, she has a heart
[3:52:43.960 --> 3:52:50.680]  on her hair, right? And it's a red heart. And she's also wearing a red mask, right, kind of having
[3:52:50.680 --> 3:52:57.880]  that association, right? There's a red heart. And later she has the mask on. And that just puts
[3:52:59.080 --> 3:53:06.360]  more ideas into your mind. I love my family is really the end concept. And right here in this
[3:53:06.360 --> 3:53:11.800]  clip, there's a lot of things going on where she's talking to the dad. And she has them saying,
[3:53:11.800 --> 3:53:17.640]  well, before, you know, I'll admit, I was really afraid. And they had this past kind of disassociated
[3:53:17.640 --> 3:53:25.000]  from her. And then, you know what, and now I feel okay. And they break the past closer to her
[3:53:25.000 --> 3:53:33.400]  associated. This is an NLP concept. Dad, I love you so much. Bam, the anchor in the feeling with
[3:53:33.400 --> 3:53:39.160]  that little animation, a little bit of sounds, all the beautiful music. And now, like I showed in
[3:53:39.160 --> 3:53:45.320]  one of my videos, all the students regurgitate all the same answers. I'm doing it for my family.
[3:53:45.320 --> 3:53:50.040]  I do it for my family. I want to make my family safe. It's just like being up on stage and
[3:53:50.600 --> 3:53:55.400]  tanning the microphone to the kids and you know, and asking them what's going on is all the same set
[3:53:55.400 --> 3:54:01.560]  response. What's been deposited into their subconscious mind. I was very obvious.
[3:54:03.560 --> 3:54:09.080]  This was really striking because you saw, as you pointed out, the red heart, the red mask,
[3:54:09.080 --> 3:54:14.680]  and then also the red eyeglass frames on the father, right, representing the love of the parents.
[3:54:14.680 --> 3:54:20.520]  And if you really look closely, even if you believe the official narratives, right, we know that
[3:54:20.520 --> 3:54:27.560]  children have not been affected by this illness. And the real justification that they would say
[3:54:27.560 --> 3:54:34.120]  for requiring the children to undergo all these procedures is so that they don't get the adults
[3:54:34.120 --> 3:54:39.320]  sick, right? It's putting that weight of that responsibility on them. They're responsible
[3:54:39.320 --> 3:54:44.920]  for their parents' health. They're responsible for their teacher's health, right? And imagine the burden
[3:54:45.560 --> 3:54:55.640]  that a child would experience related to that pressure, right? That is what allows this sort of
[3:54:55.640 --> 3:55:03.640]  expression of love to be so, so comforting because it alleviates that unfair burden put on these young
[3:55:03.640 --> 3:55:13.960]  children. Yeah, that was the big hypnotic induction in that cartoon where the mother has that face of
[3:55:13.960 --> 3:55:19.800]  disconcert, right? That worry, right? And they even use a little symbol on the mother's mouth
[3:55:19.800 --> 3:55:24.920]  that's a heart with a line through it, right? The kind of a symbol of a broken heart,
[3:55:27.480 --> 3:55:32.280]  right? And the girls bring the yellow glasses. That's the look, you know, focused on school,
[3:55:32.280 --> 3:55:37.880]  just like the fathers wearing the red glasses focused on love, right? All these little manipulation
[3:55:37.880 --> 3:55:42.840]  tactics that, you know, they seem like little bits and pieces here, but it's kind of like when you
[3:55:42.840 --> 3:55:46.680]  make a soup and you add a pinch of salt, it's not really going to do much. But if you add 10
[3:55:46.680 --> 3:55:51.320]  pinches of salt, it's going to change the soup a lot, right? So when you add in all these little
[3:55:51.320 --> 3:55:57.720]  hypnotic concepts, it makes a huge change. That's right. And it also, you know, really is
[3:55:57.720 --> 3:56:04.600]  instructive because it tells you the degree to which whoever planned that video, right,
[3:56:04.600 --> 3:56:10.520]  had to consider all these little details and put them all together so that there's a consistent
[3:56:10.520 --> 3:56:20.440]  theme to lead the viewer, right, to this hypnotic suggestion that is portraying, right? Yeah. As I
[3:56:20.440 --> 3:56:24.760]  went down the rabbit hole on this and saw it and was just mortified, you know, I kind of came out
[3:56:24.760 --> 3:56:31.240]  of my shell of not really sharing this information, just so concerned for the kids, man, it's so
[3:56:31.240 --> 3:56:36.440]  manipulative. And then we learned it was an infomercial giant behind, you know, Tony Robbins
[3:56:36.440 --> 3:56:41.160]  and the George Forming drill. And like really, that's, you're hiring not a professional doctor who
[3:56:41.160 --> 3:56:46.600]  knows about health, you're going to hire this guy to sell the products, right? And then if you go
[3:56:46.600 --> 3:56:51.160]  down the rabbit hole, who's behind the COVID response team, it starts to make a lot of sense.
[3:56:51.160 --> 3:56:58.120]  Absolutely. And we've also see this kind of material play out with, you know, an intended
[3:56:58.120 --> 3:57:03.880]  audience of children by using various pop culture figures, right? We've seen TikTok videos, we've
[3:57:03.880 --> 3:57:11.160]  seen music videos put together by, you know, some famous acts as well. So Michael, I just want to
[3:57:11.160 --> 3:57:17.080]  thank you so much for coming on the Alex Jones show today to educate us really about the techniques
[3:57:17.080 --> 3:57:23.160]  of hypnosis and how they're being used and specifically not just targeting people in general,
[3:57:23.160 --> 3:57:29.080]  but targeting our children and used by the organizations and agencies that we're supposed
[3:57:29.080 --> 3:57:36.280]  to trust, like the education departments. So that about wraps it up. Don't forget to register for
[3:57:36.280 --> 3:57:41.880]  my True Medicine Live webinar this Saturday. And of course, I will continue to be back every
[3:57:41.880 --> 3:57:46.760]  Wednesday to guest host the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show. Thank you very much.
[3:58:12.520 --> 3:58:18.760]  of corporate dictatorship under the UN. They admit all of this. They plan the lockdowns. They
[3:58:18.760 --> 3:58:24.840]  release the viruses. They think you're stupid. And their plan is to slowly cut off the resources so
[3:58:24.840 --> 3:58:30.200]  they can dictate total social control over you and your lives. That's how I was able to predict
[3:58:30.200 --> 3:58:37.000]  everything they did decades before they executed it word for word with total precision because
[3:58:37.000 --> 3:58:42.840]  they have a detailed battle plan. We cover it live weekdays 11 a.m. is 3 p.m. at info wars.com
[3:58:42.840 --> 3:59:08.120]  for a live show. Tell everybody to tune in now and war the world.
