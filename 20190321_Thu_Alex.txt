[00:00.000 --> 00:14.240]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[00:14.240 --> 00:27.200]  front lines of the Info War.
[00:27.200 --> 00:39.520]  Unfortunately for some, Alex Jones can be scary and abrasive, but if you can get through
[00:39.520 --> 00:45.720]  all that to explore what he has been saying, to see for yourself what it is that the establishment
[00:45.720 --> 00:52.480]  wants to hide from you, then the information you find could be life-changing.
[00:52.480 --> 00:58.200]  He predicted 9-11, and if there was an outside threat like a bin Laden, who was a known CIS
[00:58.200 --> 01:02.480]  in the 80s, he's the boogeyman they need, and this Orwellian phony system.
[01:02.480 --> 01:06.360]  He exposed the cremation of care ceremony at Bohemian Grove.
[01:06.360 --> 01:18.760]  He educated us about the relationship between the Third Reich and modern globalist prison
[01:18.760 --> 01:22.560]  planet dominated by a ruthless gang of control freaks.
[01:22.560 --> 01:26.360]  He helped reveal the so-called Bilderberg group at all.
[01:26.360 --> 01:30.440]  And most of you are about to stink in Paris.
[01:30.440 --> 01:35.440]  He was the loudest voice reporting on the union between the Communist Chinese and Silicon
[01:35.440 --> 01:36.440]  Valley.
[01:36.440 --> 01:40.440]  They falsely edited him.
[01:40.440 --> 01:45.160]  They lie about his reporting of Sandy Hook.
[01:45.160 --> 01:54.520]  They lie that he pushed a child down in a viral video, and now he is being de-platformed
[01:54.520 --> 01:58.640]  by Facebook, Apple, and Google.
[01:58.640 --> 02:03.240]  Private companies are being harassed and encouraged to stop doing business with him.
[02:03.240 --> 02:07.080]  And then we get hit and say, you no longer use our software.
[02:07.080 --> 02:09.920]  YouTubers are being censored for talking about him.
[02:09.920 --> 02:11.320]  We just got taken down by YouTube.
[02:11.320 --> 02:12.880]  They just killed our stream.
[02:12.880 --> 02:13.880]  Really?
[02:13.880 --> 02:14.880]  Yep.
[02:14.880 --> 02:18.760]  Americans are actually celebrating this.
[02:18.760 --> 02:20.760]  This is America in 2018.
[02:20.760 --> 02:30.560]  Will you sit by and allow liberty and freedom to be taken away right before your eyes?
[02:30.560 --> 02:35.040]  Will you do nothing while history is being recorded?
[02:35.040 --> 02:37.000]  Will you sit and do nothing?
[02:37.000 --> 02:41.200]  Or will you do your own research?
[02:41.200 --> 02:45.360]  Whatever the truth and stand for freedom.
[02:45.360 --> 03:15.160]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[03:15.160 --> 03:38.680]  We are now three hours and three minutes into the global 50-hour emergency transmission.
[03:38.680 --> 03:39.680]  David Knight just finished up.
[03:39.680 --> 03:40.680]  He's doing a great job.
[03:40.680 --> 03:41.680]  He does every weekday morning.
[03:41.680 --> 03:46.080]  We're so glad he got better from that heart attack and is back stronger than ever.
[03:46.080 --> 03:49.640]  That happens a lot when you've got major blockages and don't know it, tough cookie.
[03:49.640 --> 03:56.040]  Back in the saddle, more powerful, more powerful than ever in the fight for liberty.
[03:56.040 --> 04:00.640]  And then of course I'm here, then you've got Owen Schreuer and a bunch of special guest
[04:00.640 --> 04:08.640]  hosts, a bunch of big surprises, a huge raft of individuals as we make it the focal point.
[04:08.640 --> 04:17.200]  Stop the bias, stop the censorship, stop the election meddling, stop the racketeering.
[04:17.200 --> 04:20.640]  Stop the big multinational cartels working together to censor.
[04:20.640 --> 04:22.480]  It's only getting worse.
[04:22.480 --> 04:25.640]  As they move against the Second Amendment, they're moving against the First Amendment
[04:25.640 --> 04:30.560]  because they can't beat us politically and culturally and spiritually and economically.
[04:30.560 --> 04:33.320]  So it's all coming up, huge broadcast.
[04:33.320 --> 04:35.760]  I'll tell you all about it when we come back in 60 seconds.
[04:35.760 --> 04:42.040]  Whatever you do, please go to newswars.com and infowars.com and take the live page we've
[04:42.040 --> 04:46.400]  put up for the 50 hour broadcast and send it out to everybody you know.
[04:46.400 --> 04:50.040]  Save the First Amendment, stop big sex censorship, 50 hour emergency broadcast.
[04:50.040 --> 04:54.400]  The page is now live on the front page of infowars.com and newswars.com.
[04:54.400 --> 04:56.720]  Only you can get past the censors.
[04:56.720 --> 04:58.360]  Only you can defeat the globalist.
[04:58.360 --> 05:00.440]  You are the resistance.
[05:00.440 --> 05:04.600]  The globalist, the eugenicist are always talking down to us.
[05:04.600 --> 05:09.280]  They're always trying to make us feel small to feel insignificant.
[05:09.280 --> 05:13.600]  They try to censor because they fear you and don't want you to have the right to access
[05:13.600 --> 05:17.200]  information so you can make your own decisions.
[05:17.200 --> 05:19.400]  They want you to believe you're powerless.
[05:19.400 --> 05:25.720]  But the truth is, it is we the people and our ideas and our actions and what we say
[05:25.720 --> 05:28.280]  and what we do that changes the world.
[05:28.280 --> 05:30.360]  We are the power structure.
[05:30.360 --> 05:31.960]  We are the inventors.
[05:31.960 --> 05:32.960]  We are the trailblazers.
[05:32.960 --> 05:37.160]  And the globalists understand that.
[05:37.160 --> 05:42.400]  And they understand that they are basically trying to control and steal the future from
[05:42.400 --> 05:43.400]  we the people.
[05:43.400 --> 05:48.960]  Now, to help fund our operation that is undoubtedly the very tip of the spear against these globalists,
[05:48.960 --> 05:53.200]  I want to encourage listeners and viewers to understand that throughout the second half
[05:53.200 --> 05:57.600]  of the month of March, we're going to have store-wide free shipping and 50% off at infowarsstore.com.
[05:57.600 --> 06:17.280]  Something everybody should take advantage of.
[06:17.280 --> 06:32.000]  The Alex Jones show, because there is a war on your mind.
[06:32.000 --> 06:39.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Thursday, March 21, 2019, and we have kicked off the 50-hour
[06:39.840 --> 06:44.040]  broadcast that's running until 10 a.m. Saturday.
[06:44.040 --> 06:50.440]  I want to thank you all for joining us for the crew for the great job they're doing.
[06:50.440 --> 06:56.760]  We are posting a list, but more is being added all the time to infowars.com, and to an article
[06:56.760 --> 07:03.000]  posting on infowars.com and newswars.com about all the huge guests and special announcements
[07:03.000 --> 07:05.080]  and big things that are going to be happening.
[07:05.080 --> 07:09.840]  As we make the attack on the First Amendment here, free speech worldwide by multinational
[07:09.840 --> 07:16.160]  corporations and governments center stage and really document the censorship and control
[07:16.160 --> 07:22.480]  that we've seen, but also develop plans to counteract it, including demonstrations at
[07:22.480 --> 07:26.000]  big tech headquarters, not just going to Congress when they have committee hearings.
[07:26.000 --> 07:32.800]  I intend to continue doing that as well, but taking action and pushing Congress to take
[07:32.800 --> 07:40.000]  action, and getting legislation written, which I've done, and delivered to the president,
[07:40.000 --> 07:42.240]  oh, there's a reason they want us off air.
[07:42.240 --> 07:50.080]  So we're going to let everybody in on the next phase of the information war here.
[07:50.080 --> 07:52.680]  Because again, if we don't have the First Amendment, they're going to get the Second
[07:52.680 --> 07:57.640]  Amendment and everything else, and you notice in Australia, in New Zealand, they're passing
[07:57.640 --> 08:01.960]  draconian gun control laws, even though you have to jump through all these hoops, get
[08:01.960 --> 08:05.000]  special licenses to get semi-automatic.
[08:05.000 --> 08:09.000]  This guy had his illegally, he wasn't even in the country, you know, with the proper
[08:09.000 --> 08:10.680]  visa it's coming out.
[08:10.680 --> 08:13.280]  How was he able to do it?
[08:13.280 --> 08:15.360]  But no one discusses that.
[08:15.360 --> 08:23.400]  No, they just say, oh, we're going to take all the guns now, oh, and drudgerport.com linked
[08:23.400 --> 08:30.920]  to a zero hedge article that we posted yesterday, and I changed the zero hedge headline, basically
[08:30.920 --> 08:35.200]  dealing with the fact that the final level of censorship is here, the banning of URLs.
[08:35.200 --> 08:39.520]  Well, drudges properly changed my headline, and said the next level is here.
[08:39.520 --> 08:44.720]  And I got the thinking, well, yeah, they'll start actually banning IP addresses next,
[08:44.720 --> 08:47.640]  and then they'll just physically arrest you, like they're already doing in many areas of
[08:47.640 --> 08:53.120]  Europe, if you criticize radical Islam, or your children being groomed and sexualized
[08:53.120 --> 08:56.160]  by the LGBT community.
[08:56.160 --> 09:01.360]  So drudges right, tried to headline change on that viral article, that's from zero hedge
[09:01.360 --> 09:09.920]  dot com and info wars dot com, I had it changed to the next level is here, that's right.
[09:09.920 --> 09:13.800]  Because I started thinking, wait, drudges changed the headline, it's next level, it's
[09:13.800 --> 09:18.080]  not final level, there's a whole bunch more levels to this.
[09:18.080 --> 09:23.040]  So there you go, and that adds to all these new articles that are on info wars dot com
[09:23.040 --> 09:25.320]  that update you on the latest developments.
[09:25.320 --> 09:30.120]  They're not just banning zero hedge, the big telecoms, all three of them working in tandem
[09:30.120 --> 09:36.760]  in a concerted synchronicity, and a synchronized attack pattern, but now they're banning a
[09:36.760 --> 09:38.520]  whole bunch of others.
[09:38.520 --> 09:45.640]  Australian ISPs ban LiveLeak, but not Facebook and Twitter over shooting video, even though
[09:45.640 --> 09:51.720]  LiveLeak took it down as well, in fact, wasn't even the place it was premiered.
[09:51.720 --> 09:58.160]  But oh, you see LiveLeak's not part of the big tech monopoly, just like Andrew Torba
[09:58.160 --> 10:04.520]  and Gab got blamed because these monster that went into the synagogue last year and killed
[10:04.520 --> 10:10.040]  a bunch of people, said four minutes before, I'm going in, wow.
[10:10.040 --> 10:19.840]  So on a message board, he's going in, it's his fault, not Gab.
[10:19.840 --> 10:25.560]  It's the killer's fault, Gab, you're going to have a message board, it's like a telephone,
[10:25.560 --> 10:29.920]  it's like I called somebody and said, I'm going to go in and kill some people hypothetically.
[10:29.920 --> 10:34.480]  Is AT&T or Apple phone or droid?
[10:34.480 --> 10:35.480]  Are they to blame?
[10:35.480 --> 10:41.160]  I mean, this is just incredible how you can see the subruder film of Kennedy getting killed.
[10:41.160 --> 10:45.360]  You can watch all the PBS documentaries of the Jews being marched into pits and shot
[10:45.360 --> 10:46.360]  in the back of the head.
[10:46.360 --> 10:51.120]  It's unbelievable, but it's on TV for a reason because viewer discretion advised, but this
[10:51.120 --> 10:52.120]  is what goes on.
[10:52.120 --> 10:54.000]  Now, am I saying put it everywhere?
[10:54.000 --> 10:57.680]  No, we made the decision not to post it on our servers.
[10:57.680 --> 11:04.640]  We showed blurred footage of him going in and didn't show the people being killed.
[11:04.640 --> 11:08.280]  Seein' and others did the first few days show that with it blurred.
[11:08.280 --> 11:10.720]  But they're okay, you see.
[11:10.720 --> 11:17.240]  No, several YouTube channels that aren't ours, but we're posting our material, were banned.
[11:17.240 --> 11:25.240]  And they said because Jones said no one died and Jones said that people should be able
[11:25.240 --> 11:28.800]  to air the video and he aired it.
[11:28.800 --> 11:30.720]  And that's not true.
[11:30.720 --> 11:35.480]  We did show still shots and short clips of the gun and the writing on it and his manifesto
[11:35.480 --> 11:36.920]  just like the media did.
[11:36.920 --> 11:42.320]  Let's see where the bad people in this new class structure where corporate media is
[11:42.320 --> 11:46.000]  above the law that do whatever they want.
[11:46.000 --> 11:48.480]  Here's an example.
[11:48.480 --> 11:55.640]  As a gimmick, almost everyone you see now on CNN, MSNBC says the S-word constantly.
[11:55.640 --> 12:02.160]  And they never have an FCC issue, even though they are on a lot of broadcast stations, not
[12:02.160 --> 12:03.160]  just cable.
[12:03.160 --> 12:05.400]  No one would even think, whoa, FCC.
[12:05.400 --> 12:06.400]  That's seein' in.
[12:06.400 --> 12:13.080]  They're allowed to say Trump's full of, you know what, and I don't want to use cuss words
[12:13.080 --> 12:14.080]  here.
[12:14.080 --> 12:19.040]  The point is I'm on AM and FM radio, I'm on UHF, VHF, TV and cable stations and we
[12:19.040 --> 12:20.440]  don't do that.
[12:20.440 --> 12:25.680]  But every once in a while, once a year, if somebody slips through on the delay and we
[12:25.680 --> 12:28.800]  don't catch a cuss word, stations call them get mad at us.
[12:28.800 --> 12:29.960]  That's fine.
[12:29.960 --> 12:38.200]  But CNN is saying it every day, all these cuss words, but oh, they're God, and broadcast
[12:38.200 --> 12:42.040]  TV shows have cuss words on them.
[12:42.040 --> 12:48.880]  And the FCC does nothing, nothing.
[12:48.880 --> 12:51.960]  Like you see NFL games and people are cussing everywhere.
[12:51.960 --> 12:56.320]  All I'm saying is where's this idea that if you're a conservative, if you're a nationalist,
[12:56.320 --> 13:00.880]  if you're a Christian, if you're a libertarian, if you believe in free market capitalism and
[13:00.880 --> 13:11.280]  then you simply show videos that are being shot in public schools of small children having
[13:11.280 --> 13:19.960]  semi-naked men spread their legs in front of children's faces and stations complain.
[13:19.960 --> 13:24.600]  And I understand it's obscene, but it's being shown to children.
[13:24.600 --> 13:26.000]  See how that works?
[13:26.000 --> 13:30.640]  How are we supposed to stop it if we don't show audiences?
[13:30.640 --> 13:33.620]  In fact, here's the latest one.
[13:33.620 --> 13:39.280]  This is being glorified by Facebook and now this video of a man as a drag queen getting
[13:39.280 --> 13:46.160]  on a table like a topless dancer and spreading his legs in front of the kids.
[13:46.160 --> 13:48.360]  It's all sexual grooming.
[13:48.360 --> 13:53.120]  And telling the kids, shake your booty.
[13:53.120 --> 13:58.240]  Shake your booty and the woman gets up on her table, spreads her legs, it's a man.
[13:58.240 --> 14:01.640]  This is adult entertainment, but what do predators do?
[14:01.640 --> 14:06.760]  They target children and it's all a coming out, not just here, but in Europe targeting
[14:06.760 --> 14:13.680]  children and that's not even the super obscene stuff that, well, I mean, shouldn't we show
[14:13.680 --> 14:14.680]  it all?
[14:14.680 --> 14:19.480]  I mean, yeah, there's a 400 pound black guy dressed in a dress shaking his butt and kids
[14:19.480 --> 14:21.560]  faces saying, shake your booty.
[14:21.560 --> 14:25.520]  You know what the station's complained about and they're right, but it's what small children
[14:25.520 --> 14:26.520]  are shown.
[14:26.520 --> 14:27.520]  We're not going to show it.
[14:27.520 --> 14:32.160]  What they do is they now have them, the men show up at these events, city sponsored here
[14:32.160 --> 14:40.600]  in Austin with glitter on their genitals, no clothes, glitter on their genitals, glitter
[14:40.600 --> 14:43.880]  on their genitals.
[14:43.880 --> 14:44.880]  And that's it.
[14:44.880 --> 14:48.200]  And they go, oh, I'm wearing something and the little kids pose with full grown men who
[14:48.200 --> 14:55.600]  are naked and I shouldn't show it to you at 11, 14 central time on TV stations.
[14:55.600 --> 14:56.760]  I agree.
[14:56.760 --> 14:59.560]  It's not suitable for television.
[14:59.560 --> 15:00.840]  I cannot show you this.
[15:00.840 --> 15:06.120]  I've shown it on air and that station's complained.
[15:06.120 --> 15:14.160]  We go to these events and these are things that adults are shaken by and we cannot show
[15:14.160 --> 15:24.440]  you, but children are shown it.
[15:24.440 --> 15:27.040]  And obviously somebody in the control room thinks we, people should see it.
[15:27.040 --> 15:30.720]  No, we're not going to show it.
[15:30.720 --> 15:34.440]  These are our children we're talking about.
[15:34.440 --> 15:42.040]  But I'm digressing when we come back, we come back.
[15:42.040 --> 15:46.320]  There's so much to cover, so much to break down on so many fronts, I don't know where
[15:46.320 --> 15:50.960]  to start with the geopolitical developments, the economy developments, Mueller's report
[15:50.960 --> 15:55.120]  set to come out so much more.
[15:55.120 --> 15:59.600]  This is one broadcast you're not going to want to miss and it's going for 50 hours.
[15:59.600 --> 16:03.280]  Pain in my neck, back and shoulders has really gotten worse.
[16:03.280 --> 16:06.320]  Relief for body pain is here with Sunny Bay heating pads.
[16:06.320 --> 16:08.720]  Well, the last thing I want is to take another pill.
[16:08.720 --> 16:10.880]  So what's so good about Sunny Bay heating pads?
[16:10.880 --> 16:16.440]  Sunny Bay heating pads made by BioMed DV Design right here in the USA come in all sizes.
[16:16.440 --> 16:21.200]  Our extra large, microwavable heating pad for back pain is designed to be large enough

[20:03.480 --> 20:30.160]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:30.160 --> 20:37.160]  You found it, the undisputed number one alternative pro-America, pro-liberty broadcast in the
[20:37.160 --> 20:38.160]  world.
[20:38.160 --> 20:42.640]  In hell, some weeks we've been the number one show in the world, number one podcast,
[20:42.640 --> 20:45.000]  number one broadcast period.
[20:45.000 --> 20:49.940]  That's why the enemy is trying to censor us and suppress us because they know that freedom
[20:49.940 --> 20:50.940]  is popular.
[20:50.940 --> 20:52.440]  I am Alex Jones, your host.
[20:52.440 --> 20:57.000]  By the way, if you're a TV viewer, you're like, why does he always say I'm Alex Jones
[20:57.000 --> 20:59.200]  coming into a break?
[20:59.200 --> 21:05.560]  Local stations want that, they need that, that's how people fill out the ratings.
[21:05.560 --> 21:08.760]  That's how that's basically determined for radio.
[21:08.760 --> 21:13.520]  That's why I'm always telling you I'm Alex Jones, it's not an egomaniac thing we're
[21:13.520 --> 21:14.520]  doing.
[21:14.520 --> 21:17.640]  It is required for talk radio period.
[21:17.640 --> 21:20.760]  Rule number one, identify the program.
[21:20.760 --> 21:26.360]  Rule number one for local stations, identify their call letters and their number.
[21:26.360 --> 21:30.720]  And if they're talk radio or they're rock and roll or they're Christian or they're Spanish,
[21:30.720 --> 21:33.480]  whatever it is.
[21:33.480 --> 21:38.320]  Just throwing that out there, because I saw some comment on YouTube, it's like, Jones
[21:38.320 --> 21:42.840]  is always saying I'm Alex Jones, I'm Alex Jones, I'm Alex Jones, yes, I'm Alex Jones.
[21:42.840 --> 21:46.440]  And quite frankly, I'm proud of what we've done together.
[21:46.440 --> 21:48.360]  The audience are the info work.
[21:48.360 --> 21:49.360]  I'm not just saying that.
[21:49.360 --> 21:53.680]  All right, let me shift yours back into what I think is pretty much the top story right
[21:53.680 --> 21:59.280]  now, and that's the gun control and the attack on free speech expanding out of the epicenter
[21:59.280 --> 22:00.280]  New Zealand.
[22:00.280 --> 22:08.760]  We're not even a week after the tragic event, we're right at a week, and I've had scores
[22:08.760 --> 22:15.400]  of newspapers call, you've seen them intensify censorship against this, saying Alex Jones
[22:15.400 --> 22:16.960]  says nobody died.
[22:16.960 --> 22:23.520]  Well, I didn't say that, but if I wanted to say that, that's my right.
[22:23.520 --> 22:26.080]  And if people don't want to tune into it, the show would go away.
[22:26.080 --> 22:29.240]  But I didn't say that.
[22:29.240 --> 22:33.760]  And Rush Limbaugh came out and said what I said, the manifesto says he's an eco fascist
[22:33.760 --> 22:37.120]  that wants to depopulate the world, he wants to reduce world population, he's trying to
[22:37.120 --> 22:40.080]  get blacks and whites and others to kill each other.
[22:40.080 --> 22:48.680]  That's a classic divide and conquer Charlie Manson style, helter skelter, false flag.
[22:48.680 --> 22:53.120]  When you go and kill people to get other groups fighting and killing each other, that's one
[22:53.120 --> 22:55.440]  of the forms of classic false flag.
[22:55.440 --> 23:00.280]  People think of a classic false flag as you totally stage everything and blame it on another
[23:00.280 --> 23:01.280]  group.
[23:01.280 --> 23:06.440]  Well, you can also go kill a bunch of real people to then also trigger something.
[23:06.440 --> 23:08.040]  And so that's a fact.
[23:08.040 --> 23:10.400]  And that's what's in his manifesto.
[23:10.400 --> 23:15.160]  But the left doesn't want us on air putting that out, so they just say, oh, well, first
[23:15.160 --> 23:19.160]  he said nobody died at Parkland, didn't say that, now he says nobody died there.
[23:19.160 --> 23:24.680]  And I'm not making the story about me, it's been made about myself.
[23:24.680 --> 23:34.480]  And then once that precedent is set to restrict info wars, well, next it's Jordan Peterson.
[23:34.480 --> 23:40.320]  New Zealand just banned his 12 steps book.
[23:40.320 --> 23:45.600]  They just banned his book, but my struggle, mine comp is still sold and I think mine comp
[23:45.600 --> 23:46.600]  should be sold.
[23:46.600 --> 23:49.840]  You should be able to read what Joe Stalin said, you should be able to read what Hitler
[23:49.840 --> 23:50.840]  said.
[23:50.840 --> 23:57.800]  I'll never forget, in high school, I went to buy a copy of my struggle, I was at the
[23:57.800 --> 24:02.080]  bookstore and I saw it, a big orange-covered one, never saw that again, and I bought it
[24:02.080 --> 24:04.680]  and the lady thought I was on, she was, are you a Nazi?
[24:04.680 --> 24:09.480]  And I said, I don't forget, I was back on those little bookstores at the mall.
[24:09.480 --> 24:10.920]  I said, ma'am, are you a Nazi?
[24:10.920 --> 24:12.560]  She was, well, why do you ask?
[24:12.560 --> 24:14.400]  I said, you're selling it.
[24:14.400 --> 24:20.200]  I mean, is the person selling mine comp a bigger Nazi than the guy buying it?
[24:20.200 --> 24:25.840]  But see, she was projecting onto me because back then I had blonde hair and I was in good
[24:25.840 --> 24:30.040]  shape and I guess it did look like something out of an SS reading program was there buying
[24:30.040 --> 24:31.040]  mine comp.
[24:31.040 --> 24:35.720]  So, so I could see why she was projecting her idiocy onto me.
[24:35.720 --> 24:37.680]  I wanted to hear what Hitler actually had to say.
[24:37.680 --> 24:42.600]  That was a very badly written book and was not that interesting and a bunch of crap,
[24:42.600 --> 24:49.920]  but regardless, Jordan Peterson, the story's up on infowars.com, I apologize if Watson.
[24:49.920 --> 24:57.120]  His book is banned in the wake of New Zealand shooting.
[24:57.120 --> 24:58.520]  What does it even have to do with that?
[24:58.520 --> 25:05.920]  He's more of kind of a, almost like a leftist nationalist conservative, pro-male guy.
[25:05.920 --> 25:06.920]  He's very well-spoken.
[25:06.920 --> 25:09.960]  He makes a lot of great points, some of which I don't agree with.
[25:09.960 --> 25:16.560]  I think the way the systems promoted him is a little bit creepy, but now you notice they're
[25:16.560 --> 25:25.160]  calling in mainline news for Ben Shapiro to be banned off the internet, de-platformed.
[25:25.160 --> 25:27.720]  And now they want Jordan Peterson.
[25:27.720 --> 25:36.440]  They're never going to stop because for authoritarians, they want to be the only ones on air.
[25:36.440 --> 25:42.200]  If they got all conservatives or nationalists or libertarians off the air, if they were
[25:42.200 --> 25:47.800]  able to do that, they would then start taking each other off the air because it's still
[25:47.800 --> 25:48.800]  competition.
[25:48.800 --> 25:52.160]  And again, that's not my opinion.
[25:52.160 --> 25:59.880]  If you study Eastern Germany under the Russians and under the Stasi, there was one movie production
[25:59.880 --> 26:08.880]  company, one theater production company, one vacation company, one power company, one clothing
[26:08.880 --> 26:17.760]  company, and it was all run by czars who were incredibly rich and powerful, kingpins.
[26:17.760 --> 26:22.480]  And everyone had to fight and die, you know, who wanted to be in the arts.
[26:22.480 --> 26:25.520]  And then you had to get your books approved and your essays approved, and it was a nightmare
[26:25.520 --> 26:29.040]  situation.
[26:29.040 --> 26:35.800]  And what they're building here is far, far worse.
[26:35.800 --> 26:38.600]  So they want to take their competition off and then they want to start taking each other
[26:38.600 --> 26:41.400]  off as you've seen the left actually eating its own.
[26:41.400 --> 26:44.240]  It's a very dangerous paradigm.
[26:44.240 --> 26:50.080]  So when we come back, I'm going to get more into this because they're using New Zealand
[26:50.080 --> 26:55.160]  because they can create a consensus to take God's and take speech and say, look, New Zealand
[26:55.160 --> 26:56.160]  did it.
[26:56.160 --> 26:57.160]  We should do it.
[26:57.160 --> 27:01.360]  It's even more suspicious, he got the guns in there, he admits he's a leftist, he wants
[27:01.360 --> 27:06.600]  to depopulate people, he wants to cause this global revolution, and now the media is following
[27:06.600 --> 27:11.680]  his directives lockstep and trying to foment race war and trying to get the guns and trying
[27:11.680 --> 27:17.560]  to create the consensus out of the situation in New Zealand.
[27:17.560 --> 27:19.800]  So the thing really does stink to high heaven.
[27:19.800 --> 27:24.680]  Oh, but don't don't question crimes in America like the O.J. Simpson, there was all sorts
[27:24.680 --> 27:26.880]  of people questioning who really did that.
[27:26.880 --> 27:27.880]  That's how he got off.
[27:27.880 --> 27:31.600]  I mean, that's an Americana thing to question, but don't you do that?
[27:31.600 --> 27:32.600]  Don't you do that?
[27:32.600 --> 27:36.520]  That's the dirtiest, worst thing you could ever do.
[27:36.520 --> 27:37.520]  It's amazing.
[27:37.520 --> 27:39.840]  We're going to go to break.
[27:39.840 --> 27:44.440]  We're running huge specials that are going to have to end this weekend, a lot of them
[27:44.440 --> 27:48.680]  because a lot of the great products at m4store.com are unfortunately set to sell out, but we're

[28:14.560 --> 28:17.960]  The best iodine cleanest atomic out there, amazing.
[28:17.960 --> 28:26.280]  X2 is 55% off, 98% review of that on power reviews out of thousands and thousands.
[28:26.280 --> 28:28.000]  Can you blow that up on screen?

[28:33.320 --> 28:35.040]  I mean, that is, that is incredible.
[28:35.040 --> 28:36.040]  Okay.
[28:36.040 --> 28:37.040]  My, my eyes are on it.

[28:54.480 --> 28:58.480]  I want to thank you all for your support with the right back.
[28:58.480 --> 29:02.040]  Get the stinky dog away from me.
[29:02.040 --> 29:03.480]  Bad breath and bad gas.
[29:03.480 --> 29:04.480]  PDE stopped eating.
[29:04.480 --> 29:05.880]  All of his hair fell out.
[29:05.880 --> 29:08.080]  Itching, licking, missing fur.
[29:08.080 --> 29:10.320]  At least $5,000 in that bill.
[29:10.320 --> 29:12.360]  Cremes, antibiotics, sprays.
[29:12.360 --> 29:13.360]  No results.
[29:13.360 --> 29:15.920]  Everything we tried failed except the Dynavide.
[29:15.920 --> 29:18.720]  D-I-N-O-V-I-T-E.com.
[29:18.720 --> 29:21.120]  If you want the dog to be healthy, you've got to feed the hungry healthy.
[29:21.120 --> 29:22.840]  The Omega-3 fatty acids.
[29:22.840 --> 29:29.440]  Black seed, zinc, alfalfa, the digestive enzymes that are cooked out of regular dog food.
[29:29.440 --> 29:31.040]  Dynavide is nutrition.
[29:31.040 --> 29:32.800]  The shedding is stopped and the itching is stopped.
[29:32.800 --> 29:38.480]  Her coat is not soft, it's silky, it's healthy and shiny and glossy.
[29:38.480 --> 29:39.480]  She's got life.
[29:39.480 --> 29:40.480]  She's got energy.
[29:40.480 --> 29:41.480]  Tons of energy.
[29:41.480 --> 29:42.480]  No more bad smell.
[29:42.480 --> 29:43.480]  Dynavide's the mom.
[29:43.480 --> 29:48.920]  Dynavide is the best thing that's ever happened to my dogs, you know, besides me, of course.
[29:48.920 --> 29:50.920]  8-5-9-4-2-8-1-thousand.
[29:50.920 --> 29:52.920]  8-5-9-4-2-8-1-thousand.

[29:55.920 --> 30:03.920]  Our grandparents, our great grandparents, know that they can't food during the fall,
[30:03.920 --> 30:05.920]  so they have it during the winter.
[30:05.920 --> 30:08.920]  And that's what I'm talking about at M4WareStore.com.
[30:08.920 --> 30:15.640]  With M4WareSelect, it's the full spectrum of my patriots supply on the top, most respected
[30:15.640 --> 30:16.640]  companies out there.

[30:22.240 --> 30:24.320]  other distributors aren't able to do.

[30:43.720 --> 30:44.720]  supply.

[30:54.120 --> 31:00.840]  M4WareStore.com and M4WareSelect, high-quality storeable foods, powered by my patriots supply.
[31:00.840 --> 31:07.400]  There is a publicly admitted international plan to shut down nationalist, pro-free market,
[31:07.400 --> 31:10.600]  pro-western speech all across the world.
[31:10.600 --> 31:15.280]  And I don't want to say I'm honored, but in a way I am, to have been chosen first last
[31:15.280 --> 31:18.440]  year to be de-platformed, then they set the precedent.
[31:18.440 --> 31:23.280]  Now if you try to tell somebody the dangers of vaccines and read off the insert, they
[31:23.280 --> 31:24.800]  take you off the internet.
[31:24.800 --> 31:30.200]  Now Google announced just today that they're not going to take Christian advertising of
[31:30.200 --> 31:35.560]  most types on their platform, because it upsets the San Francisco Google employees.
[31:35.560 --> 31:41.480]  Our country and the world more and more is in the grip of anti-free speech, hyper-leftist,
[31:41.480 --> 31:46.400]  anti-human, transhumanist, who literally think they own and run our lives.
[31:46.400 --> 31:51.200]  And if we keep battling to these cults, the cancer that is San Francisco, and many of
[31:51.200 --> 31:55.440]  these big universities, is going to be the operating system of the planet.
[31:55.440 --> 31:58.880]  Humanity must awaken and say no to these control freaks.
[31:58.880 --> 32:04.080]  You know, the worst part about getting old, and I'm still strong at 45, is that I won't
[32:04.080 --> 32:05.360]  be there for my children someday.
[32:05.360 --> 32:07.200]  That's why I need to make them strong now.
[32:07.200 --> 32:08.960]  Now I can be there for my children.
[32:08.960 --> 32:10.800]  Now I can make them strong.
[32:10.800 --> 32:12.440]  Now I can instruct them.
[32:12.440 --> 32:14.040]  Now I can teach them what I've learned.
[32:14.040 --> 32:15.040]  But not once I'm gone.
[32:15.040 --> 32:18.240]  You think of this digital age, your words go on forever, but now they're even better
[32:18.240 --> 32:20.400]  getting rid of what you said and they were before.
[32:20.400 --> 32:25.120]  It's so much easier to burn video or text or languages now that we have high-tech book
[32:25.120 --> 32:26.120]  burning, isn't it?
[32:26.120 --> 32:29.520]  I have joined my will to the resistance.
[32:29.520 --> 32:33.800]  I can't be destroyed now, as long as I realize I've done right, and as long as the people
[32:33.800 --> 32:36.000]  know the truth, and you can't be destroyed either.
[32:36.000 --> 32:40.960]  As long as you bind yourself to something and commit to it, and go through the fire
[32:40.960 --> 32:45.320]  for it, there is a magic that then takes place, the transcend space and time.
[32:45.320 --> 32:49.440]  When you commit, be a word of mouth, or to pray for us, or to spread our articles and
[32:49.440 --> 32:50.440]  videos.
[32:50.440 --> 32:52.880]  That overrides everything the enemy's doing.
[32:52.880 --> 32:57.480]  So please now commit to support InfoWars, however you can, and realize your provision
[32:57.480 --> 33:03.520]  to InfoWars is your own provision.
[33:03.520 --> 33:22.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:22.440 --> 33:26.960]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com front-line report.
[33:26.960 --> 33:28.960]  It's Alex Jones.
[33:28.960 --> 33:37.560]  Well, a second U.S. jury has found that Roundup Weed Killer causes cancer.
[33:37.560 --> 33:38.960]  They always knew that.
[33:38.960 --> 33:40.880]  Also, not a good situation.
[33:40.880 --> 33:43.200]  Trump denounces TSA Child GROPE video.
[33:43.200 --> 33:45.680]  Well, let's not blame the TSA agents.
[33:45.680 --> 33:49.880]  Let's blame Congress and these laws, leave the borders open, let jihadis in, and then
[33:49.880 --> 33:52.720]  grope little kids at the president's right to decry it.
[33:52.720 --> 33:54.120]  That's an InfoWars.com story.
[33:54.120 --> 33:57.280]  You have that video coming up next hour.
[33:57.280 --> 34:03.800]  Also young people on amphetamines for ADHD have twice the psychosis and psychotic break
[34:03.800 --> 34:06.880]  risk compared to other stimulants, study says.
[34:06.880 --> 34:08.120]  Oh, wow.
[34:08.120 --> 34:11.120]  We told you that 20 years ago.
[34:11.120 --> 34:13.800]  You mean amphetamines makes people go skit so?
[34:13.800 --> 34:14.800]  Wow.
[34:14.800 --> 34:15.800]  I didn't know that.
[34:15.800 --> 34:19.840]  Oh, remember they made fun of me years ago saying Soros funded weaponized marijuana being
[34:19.840 --> 34:23.400]  legalized and then it causes psychosis and schizophrenia.
[34:23.400 --> 34:28.440]  Now a whole bunch of studies are out that schizophrenia is just off the charts because
[34:28.440 --> 34:30.280]  of weaponized marijuana.
[34:30.280 --> 34:31.880]  I'm a pro legalization dude.
[34:31.880 --> 34:36.280]  I don't smoke marijuana often myself, although I'm on the Joe Rogan podcast is the right
[34:36.280 --> 34:42.000]  of passage, I guess, but because it makes me paranoid people smoking this weaponized
[34:42.000 --> 34:45.840]  marijuana that I've known have turned into schizophrenic lunatics.
[34:45.840 --> 34:51.400]  I have known people that were completely normal, held down jobs, had good lives and they started
[34:51.400 --> 34:56.160]  smoking weaponized marijuana and started thinking space aliens were in their attic.
[34:56.160 --> 34:57.160]  Okay.
[34:57.160 --> 34:58.160]  So there's big studies on that.
[34:58.160 --> 35:00.680]  I'm going to get to that next hour as well.
[35:00.680 --> 35:03.680]  Venezuelan forces detain key aid.
[35:03.680 --> 35:06.720]  The opposition leader things are really heating up there.
[35:06.720 --> 35:09.200]  There's so much we're going to be breaking down.
[35:09.200 --> 35:14.120]  We've got a bunch of other big guests lined up today, but I saw this video.
[35:14.120 --> 35:18.120]  It's gone viral millions of views on YouTube and Facebook and everywhere else and the research
[35:18.120 --> 35:19.120]  was so good.
[35:19.120 --> 35:22.960]  I actually knew a lot of the research, but I actually learned something from it.
[35:22.960 --> 35:26.680]  The brains behind AOC.
[35:26.680 --> 35:27.680]  That's right.
[35:27.680 --> 35:30.480]  Alexandria Cortez, who's really behind her.
[35:30.480 --> 35:38.160]  Well, the popular pundit, Mr. Reagan on YouTube, Mr. Reagan, breaks it all down.
[35:38.160 --> 35:41.880]  The 18 million she raised, the million she kept, that's just the tip of the iceberg.
[35:41.880 --> 35:43.480]  Yeah, she's an idiot.
[35:43.480 --> 35:44.480]  But who's behind her?
[35:44.480 --> 35:49.040]  Mr. Reagan is a Christian conservative from Oregon with a totally unremarkable past.
[35:49.040 --> 35:52.280]  He moved to LA to try to succeed as a script writer, but failed miserably.
[35:52.280 --> 35:54.480]  He now has a popular YouTube channel with millions of views.
[35:54.480 --> 35:58.840]  And what he is, is an average guy that did research and you can go verify the stuff yourself,
[35:58.840 --> 36:00.180]  but it's still shocking.
[36:00.180 --> 36:02.920]  He lays it out in an amazing fashion.
[36:02.920 --> 36:05.200]  Thanks for joining us, Mr. Reagan.
[36:05.200 --> 36:06.200]  Thank you.
[36:06.200 --> 36:11.640]  Well, let's just get into AOC because we all think she's an idiot, but to the average
[36:11.640 --> 36:17.000]  leftist Beto supporter or whatever, Beto supporter or AOC supporter, I mean, they really like
[36:17.000 --> 36:18.000]  what they hear.
[36:18.000 --> 36:19.000]  Yeah.
[36:19.000 --> 36:20.000]  Yeah.
[36:20.000 --> 36:25.480]  I mean, she, she's completely unqualified for the position that she has, but she is charismatic.
[36:25.480 --> 36:29.220]  I mean, the people who like her love her, right?
[36:29.220 --> 36:36.680]  So she's the perfect mouthpiece for this group, the Justice Democrats, and for this guy, Sycott
[36:36.680 --> 36:43.040]  Chakrabarty and, and his friends, so watching your video, you lay it all out, but basically
[36:43.040 --> 36:47.760]  she's a cutout for these powerful politicals, lay it out for folks.
[36:47.760 --> 36:50.760]  Well it's more than just Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
[36:50.760 --> 36:54.680]  So there was a group called Brand New Congress, right?
[36:54.680 --> 36:58.880]  And I've learned a lot more since I put out the video and I'm going to put out another
[36:58.880 --> 37:03.000]  video tomorrow and this video is going to reveal a lot more.
[37:03.000 --> 37:07.520]  And it's a lot bigger than I originally thought.
[37:07.520 --> 37:13.720]  But their, their idea is to replace all the Democrats in Congress with their own what
[37:13.720 --> 37:19.400]  they call progressives, which is a code word for socialists, Marxists, right?
[37:19.400 --> 37:26.100]  So they want to put in these really far left, you know, hardcore socialist types all through
[37:26.100 --> 37:33.600]  Congress to replace all the what they call establishment Democrats with these progressives.
[37:33.600 --> 37:35.880]  But really, I think they want to control a lot of these people.
[37:35.880 --> 37:39.200]  I've talked to some of the people that are close to the campaign, and this is one of
[37:39.200 --> 37:42.200]  the things I'm going to reveal in the next video.
[37:42.200 --> 37:46.320]  They are not looking for people who are independent-minded.
[37:46.320 --> 37:50.440]  They're not looking for representatives of the constituencies that are voting for these
[37:50.440 --> 37:52.120]  Congress people.
[37:52.120 --> 37:57.600]  They are looking for people who will simply parrot their platform, right?
[37:57.600 --> 38:02.880]  They want people who are so in line with what they're thinking or who are so malleable.
[38:02.880 --> 38:07.840]  Like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, I don't think she ever knew enough about politics to contest
[38:07.840 --> 38:10.400]  anything that they tell her to say, right?
[38:10.400 --> 38:14.720]  She just doesn't have the knowledge or the experience to be able to say, well, no, I
[38:14.720 --> 38:15.920]  don't actually agree with you guys.
[38:15.920 --> 38:16.920]  I'm going to go my own way.
[38:16.920 --> 38:21.200]  And I should add, you've been not just doing internet research, you've been actually reaching
[38:21.200 --> 38:26.560]  out, contacting sources around her, and confirming what I've confirmed about Beto O'Rourke.
[38:26.560 --> 38:31.840]  He's super stupid, actually believes he's a messiah, he's told everything that he's
[38:31.840 --> 38:39.560]  supposed to say, but he is a perfect vessel, a shallow husk that just repeats what he's
[38:39.560 --> 38:40.640]  told.
[38:40.640 --> 38:48.360]  That's interesting that you say that, because I may or may not have found a link between
[38:48.360 --> 38:55.000]  one of the presidential candidates and this group, the Justice Democrats, and it may or
[38:55.000 --> 38:56.640]  may not be Beto O'Rourke.
[38:56.640 --> 39:02.640]  I'm trying to keep in that stuff close to the vest, but that's, yeah, you're onto something
[39:02.640 --> 39:03.640]  there, I think.
[39:03.640 --> 39:08.480]  But by the year on to it, they're coming up with a totally mindless puppet that these
[39:08.480 --> 39:14.080]  corporate globalists can control, and so this is the next wave, this is the future.
[39:14.080 --> 39:21.440]  Yeah, I mean, for sure there is a connection to Soros here, a lot of people dismiss the
[39:21.440 --> 39:28.040]  Soros thing as conspiracy theory stuff, but I would say, okay, when I originally came
[39:28.040 --> 39:32.360]  up with a video, I said, Cenk Uger is like the brains behind AOC, right?
[39:32.360 --> 39:34.720]  He's like the mastermind.
[39:34.720 --> 39:38.520]  That was a mistake, that was not accurate, okay?
[39:38.520 --> 39:44.160]  Micah Chakrabarty is sort of her controller, he's the one that is currently her Chief of
[39:44.160 --> 39:50.000]  Staff and was her campaign manager, but he actually answers to somebody else.
[39:50.000 --> 39:52.680]  And I'm going to go ahead and give you this information, but this is something that's
[39:52.680 --> 39:55.440]  going to be in the video tomorrow.
[39:55.440 --> 40:00.680]  The main guy, the main brains behind the whole thing, the mastermind, is Zach Exley, right?
[40:00.680 --> 40:04.200]  Zach Exley is the guy, he kind of came up with this concept of the brand new Congress
[40:04.200 --> 40:10.680]  replacing Congress a while back, and it's a much bigger plan than has been laid out
[40:10.680 --> 40:11.680]  so far.
[40:11.680 --> 40:16.240]  They've sort of just, basically what we've seen is the pilot program, right?
[40:16.240 --> 40:20.480]  The bigger program is yet to come, and I'm going to lay it all out in my next video.
[40:20.480 --> 40:26.440]  Wow, and well, I mean, that's my research is they want, quote, all these new young people,
[40:26.440 --> 40:29.720]  all this new, quote, feminist movement as well that goes with it, and then kind of have a
[40:29.720 --> 40:32.120]  whole pop culture built around it.
[40:32.120 --> 40:35.200]  Yeah, that's the guy, you've got him right there.
[40:35.200 --> 40:40.480]  It's not just the fact that they're young, I mean, these people are straight up neo-Marxists,
[40:40.480 --> 40:45.120]  and what I mean by neo-Marxist is that they buy a whole hog into the idea of socialism
[40:45.120 --> 40:49.120]  into like Soviet Union-style socialism, you know, they want this to be Venezuela.
[40:49.120 --> 40:54.120]  Sure, this is the weatherman, this is the weatherman 2.0.
[40:54.120 --> 40:55.120]  What's the weatherman?
[40:55.120 --> 40:58.000]  Well, when I say the weatherman, I mean, you know, back then the communists were violent
[40:58.000 --> 41:02.200]  and wanted to overthrow, now they're just trying to get elected.
[41:02.200 --> 41:05.880]  Right, I mean, he says in a video, he says, look, you know, we've got this beautiful democratic
[41:05.880 --> 41:06.880]  system.
[41:06.880 --> 41:11.240]  Let's use the democratic system that we have to elect officials so that we can take over
[41:11.240 --> 41:12.240]  the government.
[41:12.240 --> 41:16.440]  Yeah, like, that's an actual state, I'm going to play the audio on my video so everybody
[41:16.440 --> 41:17.440]  can hear it.
[41:17.440 --> 41:20.120]  It's not like I'm not just making this stuff up out of thin air.
[41:20.120 --> 41:21.320]  This is all documented.
[41:21.320 --> 41:22.320]  He does a ton of interviews.
[41:22.320 --> 41:23.320]  Tell us about this.
[41:23.320 --> 41:26.600]  I've only seen Zach actually a couple of times, but I knew he was involved, and from
[41:26.600 --> 41:32.560]  your research, you believe he's her main handler and kind of beta testing with her.
[41:32.560 --> 41:35.080]  Tell us about Zach Exley.
[41:35.080 --> 41:37.280]  Well Zach Exley is an interesting character.
[41:37.280 --> 41:45.720]  He grew up, I think in Connecticut, you know, fairly well off family, and his parents were
[41:45.720 --> 41:47.200]  strong atheists.
[41:47.200 --> 41:53.560]  So he grew up, this very strong, hard left atheist, basically taught to distrust and
[41:53.560 --> 41:58.120]  hate Christians, thinking Christians are psychopaths who believe, you know, who are
[41:58.120 --> 42:02.920]  all racist, homophobic, you know, sexist, you know, degenerates.
[42:02.920 --> 42:07.440]  And then he met his wife, I think in 2003 or something, they got married, and she was
[42:07.440 --> 42:08.440]  a Christian.
[42:08.440 --> 42:12.080]  And so she took him to church, and he wanted to go to church because he wanted to see this
[42:12.080 --> 42:14.120]  phenomenon of all these crazy people.
[42:14.120 --> 42:16.160]  I mean, that's really why he wanted to go.
[42:16.160 --> 42:20.200]  But what he found was he ended up going to like a very far left church, and he ended up
[42:20.200 --> 42:22.080]  becoming a Christian.
[42:22.080 --> 42:24.880]  This is something I'm not even going to talk about in the video, but he became this like
[42:24.880 --> 42:25.880]  far left.
[42:25.880 --> 42:27.840]  So he didn't really change his ideology.
[42:27.840 --> 42:30.920]  He didn't say, okay, because of Christ and Christianity, I'm going to change my...
[42:30.920 --> 42:34.080]  No, he's an ecumenicalist now, liberation theology.
[42:34.080 --> 42:36.800]  He's going to use it to create a leftist religion.
[42:36.800 --> 42:37.800]  Absolutely.
[42:37.800 --> 42:38.800]  Absolutely.
[42:38.800 --> 42:40.800]  He kind of does the same thing the terrorists do.
[42:40.800 --> 42:44.840]  He evokes the Bible to justify what he's doing as opposed to...
[42:44.840 --> 42:47.960]  Yeah, and if you track him, you're going to find Carnegie Endowment Ford Foundation's
[42:47.960 --> 42:52.440]  Liberation Theology, it's all been cooked up by a certain three-letter agency.
[42:52.440 --> 42:59.440]  We'll be right back with Mr. Reagan and his great exposé of AOC and more, stay with us.
[42:59.440 --> 43:04.480]  And now, through the end of March, we are running the biggest special of this year.

[44:58.520 --> 45:04.720]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[45:04.720 --> 45:09.440]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[45:09.440 --> 45:10.960]  to detoxify the body.
[45:10.960 --> 45:15.840]  That's why I'm introducing Z Shield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[45:15.840 --> 45:17.360]  It's made in the USA.
[45:17.360 --> 45:22.280]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[45:22.280 --> 45:24.120]  the body and it supports the InfoWare.
[45:24.120 --> 45:26.360]  It is a classical 360 win.
[45:26.360 --> 45:30.840]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe
[45:30.840 --> 45:35.520]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[45:35.520 --> 45:36.520]  get.
[45:36.520 --> 45:39.720]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this
[45:39.720 --> 45:44.760]  country and the world that Patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you
[45:44.760 --> 45:49.960]  can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the
[45:49.960 --> 45:52.720]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[45:52.720 --> 45:56.000]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[45:56.000 --> 46:00.400]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z Shield and InfoWareStore.com.
[46:00.400 --> 46:05.280]  There are thousands of ideologies out there, hundreds of different political systems and
[46:05.280 --> 46:08.160]  most of them are funded by the globalist.
[46:08.160 --> 46:10.880]  InfoWareStore is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[46:10.880 --> 46:14.400]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[46:14.400 --> 46:16.040]  I didn't invent all this.
[46:16.040 --> 46:20.920]  I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana, and what really works for humanity and I'm
[46:20.920 --> 46:25.320]  simply trying to bring it back and lo and behold, it's super popular like it's always
[46:25.320 --> 46:26.320]  been.
[46:26.320 --> 46:30.680]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately because we have the
[46:30.680 --> 46:34.200]  light in the dark of the night that sends chills up my spine.
[46:34.200 --> 46:39.080]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and InfoWareStore.com by buying the great products
[46:39.080 --> 46:43.480]  at InfoWareStore.com, by spreading the articles, by spreading the videos, and by praying for
[46:43.480 --> 46:48.080]  this operation and for praying for this nation and the world for peace and discernment.
[46:48.080 --> 46:51.800]  For myself and the whole InfoWareStore.com family, I want to thank all of you for what
[46:51.800 --> 46:55.920]  you've done because without you, InfoWareStore.com is nothing.
[46:55.920 --> 47:03.520]  You are the InfoWare and I salute you.
[47:03.520 --> 47:22.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[47:22.320 --> 47:26.520]  The resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[47:26.520 --> 47:30.320]  It's Alex Jones.
[47:30.320 --> 47:34.640]  You know, it's sad that we see massive draconian censorship against the nationalists, conservatives,
[47:34.640 --> 47:39.080]  Christians, and others because we're so popular, but as they ban more of us, just more people
[47:39.080 --> 47:43.720]  come forward because they're standing up for their families and they're just as well-spoken
[47:43.720 --> 47:46.880]  or more well-spoken than those of us that get banned many places.
[47:46.880 --> 47:51.480]  And so the depth of our chart, this is a football game, is getting very, very deep and very,
[47:51.480 --> 47:52.480]  very good.
[47:52.480 --> 47:56.120]  Meanwhile, you go to a leftist rally, it's, I don't take pleasure how dumb down they
[47:56.120 --> 47:58.560]  are, how cult-like they are, how stupid they are.
[47:58.560 --> 48:02.720]  There's new videos on InfoWareStore.com that Caitlin Bennett shot and they're like, one's
[48:02.720 --> 48:07.880]  12 minutes, one's 15 minutes, and they're unedited other than in between the people.
[48:07.880 --> 48:11.920]  And she'll talk to 30 people who support Beto O'Rourke but don't know what his real
[48:11.920 --> 48:15.640]  name is or who physically attack her.
[48:15.640 --> 48:18.120]  And it's just they're invincibly ignorant.
[48:18.120 --> 48:23.720]  We're gonna go back to Mr. Reagan here in a moment who has, from his own research, ferried
[48:23.720 --> 48:25.720]  it out, who's handling her, who's manipulating her.
[48:25.720 --> 48:30.360]  We know Beto O'Rourke, number one funder is Foundations, Soros Funds, same thing with
[48:30.360 --> 48:35.560]  her, but what's the new ideology, the new variant of leftist garbage with national
[48:35.560 --> 48:36.560]  polls?
[48:36.560 --> 48:47.080]  44 to about 55% of leftists out there actually will tell millennials 44 to 55% say they're
[48:47.080 --> 48:48.600]  socialist or communist.
[48:48.600 --> 48:49.600]  That's just horrifying.
[48:49.600 --> 48:50.600]  Yeah.
[48:50.600 --> 48:55.320]  Well, you know, I was saying before it's, it's not just a socialist.
[48:55.320 --> 48:57.800]  It's a neo Marxism, right?
[48:57.800 --> 49:04.360]  Neo Marxism doesn't just take in this socialist communist idea, which is to me completely
[49:04.360 --> 49:05.360]  mental.
[49:05.360 --> 49:06.360]  It's not just economic.
[49:06.360 --> 49:10.080]  It's totally social where you play everybody off against each other.
[49:10.080 --> 49:11.080]  That's right.
[49:11.080 --> 49:19.040]  They're taking in this extra, this added delusion of, you know, oppression and oppressor, right?
[49:19.040 --> 49:23.400]  So they say, these are the oppressed people and they're the good victims, right?
[49:23.400 --> 49:26.600]  And these are the oppressors and they're evil, right?
[49:26.600 --> 49:31.440]  And you should hate them and you should love these people and that's their platform, right?
[49:31.440 --> 49:37.200]  And that's Exley's platform, that's Psycho Chakraborty's platform, that's AOC's platform,
[49:37.200 --> 49:38.200]  that's Beto's platform.
[49:38.200 --> 49:43.240]  And it's mental because some of these guys are straight white Christian men and they're
[49:43.240 --> 49:45.560]  saying straight white Christian men are evil.
[49:45.560 --> 49:49.840]  In fact, that's the litmus test with Beto this week shed.
[49:49.840 --> 49:50.840]  White men are bad.
[49:50.840 --> 49:51.840]  I'm sorry.
[49:51.840 --> 49:52.840]  I'm bad.
[49:52.840 --> 49:53.840]  I don't get that.
[49:53.840 --> 49:54.840]  I mean, I don't get that.
[49:54.840 --> 49:56.840]  Like how clearly bigotry.
[49:56.840 --> 50:00.600]  I mean, that's exactly, it's exactly what we've been fighting.
[50:00.600 --> 50:03.800]  It's a 180 the opposite of Martin Luther King's Veritas.
[50:03.800 --> 50:04.800]  Yeah.
[50:04.800 --> 50:05.800]  And Lincoln.
[50:05.800 --> 50:06.800]  I mean, we free the slaves.
[50:06.800 --> 50:11.440]  We were trying to create civil rights in America and then people turn around and say, actually
[50:11.440 --> 50:13.320]  white people are evil.
[50:13.320 --> 50:14.320]  Actually men are all.
[50:14.320 --> 50:20.880]  And as you know, up until the Civil War, only 2% of people had slaves and most whites ancestors
[50:20.880 --> 50:24.000]  came here after the Civil War had nothing to do with slavery.
[50:24.000 --> 50:27.280]  I mean, it's just, yeah, my family came here after the Civil War.
[50:27.280 --> 50:28.280]  Yeah.
[50:28.280 --> 50:29.280]  Yeah.
[50:29.280 --> 50:34.280]  And I'd also say, look, people often talk about reparations, right?
[50:34.280 --> 50:35.280]  People often talk about reparations.
[50:35.280 --> 50:36.280]  I say this.
[50:36.280 --> 50:41.000]  What about the reparations that were paid in blood by the men who died for the freedom
[50:41.000 --> 50:45.560]  of the slaves in the Civil War?
[50:45.560 --> 50:46.560]  You're absolutely right.
[50:46.560 --> 50:50.720]  But what's crazy is it was the Democrats who blocked reparations at the time when the
[50:50.720 --> 50:57.760]  Republicans wanted a couple of hundred acres and three mules and, you know, and $50, $100.
[50:57.760 --> 50:58.760]  It was all debated.
[50:58.760 --> 51:02.600]  The Democrats finally settled on 40 acres in a mule, but then they tried to block that
[51:02.600 --> 51:03.600]  in the South.
[51:03.600 --> 51:08.160]  I'm not bashing the South, it's just it was the Democrats blocked original reparations
[51:08.160 --> 51:09.160]  directly to slaves.
[51:09.160 --> 51:12.040]  If you're going to have it, hey, you've been a slave.
[51:12.040 --> 51:13.040]  Here's a future.
[51:13.040 --> 51:14.040]  Here's some land.
[51:14.040 --> 51:15.040]  You're a farmer.
[51:15.040 --> 51:16.560]  You don't know anything else to do.
[51:16.560 --> 51:17.560]  Get on your feet.
[51:17.560 --> 51:18.560]  Here's a farm.
[51:18.560 --> 51:19.560]  No.
[51:19.560 --> 51:21.560]  The Democrats blocked it.
[51:21.560 --> 51:22.720]  You know your history, my friend.
[51:22.720 --> 51:23.720]  Well, I don't mean to rant.
[51:23.720 --> 51:25.760]  I've got you here to talk about AOC.
[51:25.760 --> 51:28.120]  So how is it going for them?
[51:28.120 --> 51:31.320]  Because no matter how dumb they are and how corrupt, they get more and more popular with
[51:31.320 --> 51:33.840]  liberals, but unpopular with conservatives.
[51:33.840 --> 51:38.680]  So how has this moved to communism and socialism and cultural Marxism going right now in the
[51:38.680 --> 51:39.680]  country?
[51:39.680 --> 51:45.920]  Well, you know, they just did a poll with AOC and she pulled relatively poorly.
[51:45.920 --> 51:48.360]  But of course, the mainstream media doesn't want to report that.
[51:48.360 --> 51:49.520]  So but they kind of have to write.
[51:49.520 --> 51:50.520]  That's news.
[51:50.520 --> 51:51.520]  That's news.
[51:51.520 --> 51:53.520]  So 37% still too high.
[51:53.520 --> 51:56.640]  Oh, wait, absolutely is still too high.
[51:56.640 --> 51:58.760]  But she's a very charismatic person, right?
[51:58.760 --> 52:03.320]  I mean, this is the kind of concept of the left and of socialism.
[52:03.320 --> 52:07.760]  You want a charismatic leader at the top, inspiring people to believe delusions, right?
[52:07.760 --> 52:08.760]  That's it.
[52:08.760 --> 52:12.000]  I mean, people will believe stuff if you have somebody that's charismatic enough telling
[52:12.000 --> 52:13.000]  them.
[52:13.000 --> 52:16.240]  So she's selling the Kool-Aid at the Jim Jones compound.
[52:16.240 --> 52:17.240]  That's right.
[52:17.240 --> 52:20.840]  And actually, I think it was Lenin that said, if you say a lie often enough, it becomes
[52:20.840 --> 52:21.840]  the truth.
[52:21.840 --> 52:24.560]  So what do you think is in AOC's future?
[52:24.560 --> 52:28.640]  Because I agree the think tanks and the leftist groups, they're all pushing people like her.
[52:28.640 --> 52:29.640]  She's the beta test.
[52:29.640 --> 52:33.960]  But the Democratic Party thinks she's hurting them, and there's some talk about them jettising
[52:33.960 --> 52:34.960]  her.
[52:34.960 --> 52:38.160]  But Dinesha Susan went to prison for nine months for a $20,000 campaign contribution.
[52:38.160 --> 52:39.840]  He didn't file a paperwork.
[52:39.840 --> 52:40.840]  She's kept over a million.
[52:40.840 --> 52:44.520]  What do you think is going to happen there?
[52:44.520 --> 52:48.160]  Well, you know, from the research that I've done, and I can't prove this.
[52:48.160 --> 52:49.760]  So this is all speculation.
[52:49.760 --> 52:52.360]  This is all preliminary research.
[52:52.360 --> 52:58.020]  Stuff that people have told me and stuff that seems to be true from what I've seen.
[52:58.020 --> 52:59.480]  This is all exly.
[52:59.480 --> 53:01.040]  Exly's been doing this for a while now.
[53:01.040 --> 53:07.400]  He's run several campaigns before this, you know, brand new Congress, Justice Democrats
[53:07.400 --> 53:08.480]  thing.
[53:08.480 --> 53:14.080]  And this sort of shell game of moving money around to different packs and stuff like that.
[53:14.080 --> 53:15.240]  That's his thing, right?
[53:15.240 --> 53:19.080]  He developed this technique to essentially, I think, hide money so it doesn't have to
[53:19.080 --> 53:20.920]  be reported.
[53:20.920 --> 53:27.520]  So I think that if the people investigating this look more at him, and there's a name
[53:27.520 --> 53:30.200]  of one of the packs that I was given as a tip.
[53:30.200 --> 53:33.320]  And I can't research this stuff because I'm not an actual reporter.
[53:33.320 --> 53:34.800]  Well, let's admit it.
[53:34.800 --> 53:40.280]  He's involved when they raised 18 million and she pocketed, I mean, a million has disappeared
[53:40.280 --> 53:41.280]  at least.
[53:41.280 --> 53:42.280]  Yeah, absolutely.
[53:42.280 --> 53:47.080]  I mean, they're going to find some nefarious stuff.
[53:47.080 --> 53:48.240]  Who's going to get in trouble for that?
[53:48.240 --> 53:49.240]  I don't know.
[53:49.240 --> 53:54.520]  It almost certainly won't be Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez because I don't think she knows anything
[53:54.520 --> 53:55.520]  that's going on.
[53:55.520 --> 53:57.560]  But again, I think she's just a puppet.
[53:57.560 --> 54:01.800]  Well, that's like Bernie Sanders, his wife swindling a university.
[54:01.800 --> 54:03.800]  He's got three $1 million houses.
[54:03.800 --> 54:07.000]  He drives $109,000 cars.
[54:07.000 --> 54:09.240]  And the thing is, it's okay if he hadn't stolen the money.
[54:09.240 --> 54:10.880]  He's never had a real job in his life.
[54:10.880 --> 54:16.400]  These Democrats, just like you see in Venezuela, the socialists always live like kings, but
[54:16.400 --> 54:19.120]  they're telling everybody else that they should be poor.
[54:19.120 --> 54:24.360]  Yeah, I was on another radio show and I said, look, they're practicing socialism now.
[54:24.360 --> 54:26.080]  They're calling it hypocrisy.
[54:26.080 --> 54:27.080]  But this is socialism.
[54:27.080 --> 54:31.440]  I mean, socialism is you've got this very thin layer of super rich at the top and then
[54:31.440 --> 54:33.800]  everybody else is dirt poor, right?
[54:33.800 --> 54:40.360]  And so the concept of like these elites, you know, encouraging the people at like say Occupy
[54:40.360 --> 54:45.520]  Wall Street who are living in tents and, you know, absolutely filthy.
[54:45.520 --> 54:49.480]  But then these elites on the top are going and saying these elite hotels.
[54:49.480 --> 54:52.480]  Well, that's, you know, that is socialism, right?
[54:52.480 --> 54:53.480]  People don't realize.
[54:53.480 --> 54:58.840]  You know, it's going to raise up the, you know, black people and women and gay people
[54:58.840 --> 54:59.840]  know it isn't.
[54:59.840 --> 55:00.840]  It's all about dividing conquer.
[55:00.840 --> 55:01.840]  We're going to go to break.
[55:01.840 --> 55:05.680]  I want to do five more minutes with you and get more tips on what, because you're being
[55:05.680 --> 55:06.680]  polite.
[55:06.680 --> 55:09.360]  You're being nice and saying, you know, I'm not a journalist, but you put together a
[55:09.360 --> 55:10.360]  lot of the research.
[55:10.360 --> 55:11.360]  You've gone public.
[55:11.360 --> 55:12.360]  Yeah.
[55:12.360 --> 55:13.360]  Now you're getting more contacts.
[55:13.360 --> 55:14.360]  I've seen your video.
[55:14.360 --> 55:15.360]  What you talk about it is documented.
[55:15.360 --> 55:16.360]  It's going to know you're out there.
[55:16.360 --> 55:20.400]  But I want to ask you how you think we go on the offense against this when we come back
[55:20.400 --> 55:21.400]  in just two minutes.
[55:21.400 --> 55:22.400]  Okay.
[55:22.400 --> 55:26.640]  We are four hours in basically to the 50 hour special transmission.
[55:26.640 --> 55:28.200]  David Knight came on at 8am.
[55:28.200 --> 55:30.800]  I'm 55 minutes into this broadcast.
[55:30.800 --> 55:35.600]  We've got a bunch of other big guests today and this is the save the first amendment.
[55:35.600 --> 55:37.200]  Stop big tech.
[55:37.200 --> 55:38.200]  Stop the bias.
[55:38.200 --> 55:39.200]  50 hour broadcast.
[55:39.200 --> 55:43.120]  We've got everybody from Laura Loomer to Tommy Robinson joining us.
[55:43.120 --> 55:46.960]  I believe Joe said he could do it, but Joe is famously busy.
[55:46.960 --> 55:50.600]  Joe Rogan, I believe will be in studio tomorrow at around two o'clock.
[55:50.600 --> 55:52.600]  Okay, but regardless, I'm going to interview with him.
[55:52.600 --> 55:53.600]  He's coming to town.
[55:53.600 --> 55:55.000]  And there's a bunch of other surprise guests.
[55:55.000 --> 56:00.800]  I'm going to leave it at that from now right through Saturday morning, 10am, focal point
[56:00.800 --> 56:05.200]  on free speech and a focal point on what we're fighting and what the stakes are.
[56:05.200 --> 56:11.120]  Please don't forget, store-wide free shipping right now, 50% off all the supplements and
[56:11.120 --> 56:12.120]  a bunch of other specials.
[56:12.120 --> 56:19.520]  But each hour, we will have one of our best selling products at 55% off.
[56:19.520 --> 56:22.880]  Then there's double-patriot points and if you sign up for auto-ship, you cancel any time
[56:22.880 --> 56:26.880]  for free, you get an additional 10% off.
[56:26.880 --> 56:29.880]  It just goes on and on and on and on from there.
[56:29.880 --> 56:30.880]  Infoldwarstore.com.
[56:30.880 --> 56:31.880]  Halogens.
[56:31.880 --> 56:33.360]  There's a lot of bad halogens.
[56:33.360 --> 56:35.040]  Iodine's the good halogen.
[56:35.040 --> 56:37.040]  Most of the iodine out there is a bunch of bound garbage.
[56:37.040 --> 56:40.880]  If you don't have oxygen, if you don't have vitamin C, if you don't have water, you die.
[56:40.880 --> 56:44.280]  If you don't have iodine, finale, takes a few months, but that's it.
[56:44.280 --> 56:45.480]  It's over.
[56:45.480 --> 56:49.080]  But most iodine's out of the soil or it's bound, you don't absorb it.
[56:49.080 --> 56:54.920]  Research iodine deficiencies and loss of brain power, lower IQ, you name it.
[56:54.920 --> 56:57.840]  Research iodine additives to your life, everything.
[56:57.840 --> 57:00.640]  Stamina, libido, your hormones are based on it.
[57:00.640 --> 57:01.640]  It's so important.
[57:01.640 --> 57:03.000]  X2, we thought we couldn't get it anymore.
[57:03.000 --> 57:04.760]  The Deep Earth Crystal, it's here.
[57:04.760 --> 57:05.760]  X3 is excellent as well.
[57:05.760 --> 57:08.840]  It's a different type of Deep Earth Crystal, similar because it's a different supplier.
[57:08.840 --> 57:11.840]  We've got to say it's a different formula, so out of the other two types, I think it's
[57:11.840 --> 57:12.840]  just as good.
[57:12.840 --> 57:20.240]  The point is, X2 is what you want, X2 is available, 55% off, fluoride-free toothpaste, super blue,
[57:20.240 --> 57:25.600]  4 to 5 colloidal silver iodine, super blue right now is our best-selling product, especially
[57:25.600 --> 57:26.600]  when it's 50% off.
[57:26.600 --> 57:28.360]  A bunch of stuff is selling out as well.
[57:28.360 --> 57:32.560]  We'll have this, store-wide free shipping, 50% off, go as long as we can until a lot
[57:32.560 --> 57:33.800]  of these items sell out.
[57:33.800 --> 57:38.840]  But each hour, there's a special at 55% off, so take advantage of X2 and help fund the
[57:38.840 --> 57:40.880]  tip of the spear in the fight against the global.
[57:40.880 --> 57:47.880]  Mr. Reagan, with his great reports on AOC, tells us how to fight back straight ahead.
[58:10.880 --> 58:24.320]  We have developed, hands down, from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout
[58:24.320 --> 58:27.200]  and beyond system in the world.
[58:27.200 --> 58:29.600]  There's nothing else like it, you must experience it.
[58:29.600 --> 58:34.200]  It is a total game changer, and it comes in easy to use, packaged, mixed in with fruit
[58:34.200 --> 58:36.600]  juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[58:36.600 --> 58:40.360]  Warning though, it's very, very strong, it lasts up to 10 hours, so take a half pack
[58:40.360 --> 58:44.520]  at the first time you take it, because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you
[58:44.520 --> 58:45.520]  into overdrive.
[58:45.520 --> 58:46.520]  TurboForce and m4slife.com.
[58:46.520 --> 58:53.000]  We all know the importance of fish oils.
[58:53.000 --> 58:57.080]  While we are sure to provide them for ourselves, it's just as important to make sure your kids
[58:57.080 --> 58:59.720]  get their EPA and DHA too.
[58:59.720 --> 59:03.600]  Honor Roll is a powerful DHA fish oil formula for your child.
[59:03.600 --> 59:08.840]  Built from the ground up to support your child's development, this formula uses wild
[59:08.840 --> 59:14.680]  anchovy fish oil, ultra-purified krill oil, and wild salmon fish oil with vitamins to
[59:14.680 --> 59:17.040]  boost your child's mind and body.
[59:17.040 --> 59:22.600]  With this fish oil formula, you can support your child's optimal heart, joint, cognitive,
[59:22.600 --> 59:27.320]  and brain health while providing DHA, which has been shown to be essential for your child's
[59:27.320 --> 59:29.080]  brain growth spurts.
[59:29.080 --> 59:35.440]  Built on powerful ingredients with 580 milligrams of high DHA omega-3s, this formula is highly
[59:35.440 --> 59:38.760]  refined to eliminate nearly all heavy metals.
[59:38.760 --> 59:43.200]  If you're looking for a formula to help your child grow, look no further.
[59:43.200 --> 59:52.920]  Try Honor Roll from InfowarsLife at InfowarsStore.com.
[59:52.920 --> 1:00:21.920]  Or listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[1:00:23.920 --> 1:00:29.200]  She lied on test scores, it's turned out, put the red state article up on screen for
[1:00:29.200 --> 1:00:30.680]  TV viewers.
[1:00:30.680 --> 1:00:34.480]  Alexandria Cortez lied about her test scores to a public education group.
[1:00:34.480 --> 1:00:39.360]  Well, of course she did, I mean, Pocahontas lied on the bar here in Texas to say she was
[1:00:39.360 --> 1:00:41.160]  Native American, so she got into college.
[1:00:41.160 --> 1:00:48.400]  These are frauds, these are scamsters, these are virtue signalers, it's how they operate.
[1:00:48.400 --> 1:00:52.960]  But let me tell you, Beto O'Rourke got beaten by Ted Cruz, even though he engaged in a massive
[1:00:52.960 --> 1:00:58.200]  election fraud, but he did get record amounts of people registered, and he did get a bunch
[1:00:58.200 --> 1:01:00.800]  of Democrats elected and they took over most of the courts.
[1:01:00.800 --> 1:01:06.000]  So Texas is within an inch of being blue, that's a fact.
[1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:13.080]  So if anything, they're good to go out and get young people who want a free ride, so
[1:01:13.080 --> 1:01:18.280]  basically like an angler fish, advertise with that light of free goods, it's really a train
[1:01:18.280 --> 1:01:22.640]  coming head on at you, and that's really their job for my research is to get a bunch of young
[1:01:22.640 --> 1:01:27.440]  morons to smoke the socialist dope.
[1:01:27.440 --> 1:01:30.280]  Mr. Reagan, popular YouTube analyst, joins us.
[1:01:30.280 --> 1:01:33.400]  What do you think this is really all about and how do we counter it?
[1:01:33.400 --> 1:01:39.640]  I'll tell you what I think it's all about, I think it is about an outside group sort
[1:01:39.640 --> 1:01:44.840]  of taking over congressional seats, because these guys didn't just bring in AOC, right?
[1:01:44.840 --> 1:01:51.720]  They brought in Ayanna Presley, they brought in Rashida Tliab or however you pronounce
[1:01:51.720 --> 1:01:57.960]  her name, they endorsed Ilhan Omar, I mean, I think there's seven people that they endorsed
[1:01:57.960 --> 1:02:03.440]  that are now in Congress, and I think they fully control three of them, right?
[1:02:03.440 --> 1:02:06.000]  There are people that they brought in from the beginning.
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:12.520]  They're dangerous because they're this entity that kind of, I think if they instruct these
[1:02:12.520 --> 1:02:18.840]  congressmen, or congresswomen, how to vote, what to propose to Congress, what to tweet,
[1:02:18.840 --> 1:02:23.880]  what to say to the American people, and that's not how Americans expect their democracy to
[1:02:23.880 --> 1:02:24.880]  be.
[1:02:24.880 --> 1:02:27.240]  Sure, so there's always been lobbyists, but you're now saying from the ground up they're
[1:02:27.240 --> 1:02:32.840]  creating and engineering people that are absolute, basically robots.
[1:02:32.840 --> 1:02:37.520]  Yes, it is the difference between control and influence, right?
[1:02:37.520 --> 1:02:39.240]  Influence, we don't like influence, right?
[1:02:39.240 --> 1:02:41.080]  But you know, it's gonna happen.
[1:02:41.080 --> 1:02:44.160]  But control is different, that is much more severe, that's a much more.
[1:02:44.160 --> 1:02:46.960]  Yeah, these aren't leaders, these are drones.
[1:02:46.960 --> 1:02:51.160]  Yeah, they're drones, they're NPCs, if you will.
[1:02:51.160 --> 1:02:56.120]  And I think that the only way we can stop this really is to get the word out there to
[1:02:56.120 --> 1:02:58.040]  promote this idea.
[1:02:58.040 --> 1:03:02.520]  I mean, if you really want to know everything that's going on, you've got to subscribe to
[1:03:02.520 --> 1:03:04.640]  my YouTube channel, Mr. Reagan.
[1:03:04.640 --> 1:03:09.520]  Watch the next video I'm gonna put out tomorrow, and then, you know, try to share that.
[1:03:09.520 --> 1:03:13.520]  Because the more people who know what's going on, like if you know that this candidate is
[1:03:13.520 --> 1:03:17.320]  associated with justice Democrats, right?
[1:03:17.320 --> 1:03:20.840]  That should trigger in your mind, I can't vote for this person.
[1:03:20.840 --> 1:03:25.640]  Because this person is not an autonomous independent thinking person, they're controlled by this
[1:03:25.640 --> 1:03:26.640]  outside group.
[1:03:26.640 --> 1:03:30.600]  And we can't have that, we can't have outside groups controlling our government.
[1:03:30.600 --> 1:03:36.920]  Well, you're absolutely right, the fact that she's as funny as a plastic banana, and the
[1:03:36.920 --> 1:03:42.360]  fact that Beto or Rourke is as well, and that they're just empty suits, is their Achilles
[1:03:42.360 --> 1:03:43.360]  heel.
[1:03:43.360 --> 1:03:48.160]  And also the hypocrisy, the $3,000, $5,000 suit she wears, and the private jets, and
[1:03:48.160 --> 1:03:51.920]  then she's saying it's all bad, and she goes, oh, this is the world I live in.
[1:03:51.920 --> 1:03:56.760]  So she's saying she's not gonna make any sacrifice for what she thinks you should do, she just
[1:03:56.760 --> 1:03:58.240]  wants you to do what she says.
[1:03:58.240 --> 1:04:02.560]  Although you got it right on the nose, the hypocrisy is mental.
[1:04:02.560 --> 1:04:06.520]  I mean, really, if she was somebody who was passionate about the environment, she would
[1:04:06.520 --> 1:04:08.320]  already be doing these things.
[1:04:08.320 --> 1:04:13.640]  She would already be avoiding the jets, and doing all the environmentally stuff, she doesn't
[1:04:13.640 --> 1:04:14.640]  care about that stuff.
[1:04:14.640 --> 1:04:17.600]  She's doing that because her people told her to do it.
[1:04:17.600 --> 1:04:21.720]  And the hypocrisy is crazy, because she's saying that the United States needs to adopt
[1:04:21.720 --> 1:04:27.560]  all of these things, despite the fact that other countries are far behind us, with regard
[1:04:27.560 --> 1:04:29.760]  to how environmentally friendly we are, like China.
[1:04:29.760 --> 1:04:32.960]  But she's saying we need to lead the way, we need to be the example.
[1:04:32.960 --> 1:04:58.520]  But she will not be the example for her constituency, for her people.
[1:04:58.520 --> 1:05:10.520]  And that's what I'm talking about at M4sTour.com, with M4 Select, it's the full spectrum of
[1:05:10.520 --> 1:05:14.600]  my patriot supply, one of the top most respected companies out there.
[1:05:14.600 --> 1:05:20.240]  But because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their
[1:05:20.240 --> 1:05:22.320]  other distributors aren't able to do.
[1:05:22.320 --> 1:05:26.600]  But I want to be a market leader, and I want you to have swarable food, so it's a total
[1:05:26.600 --> 1:05:27.600]  win-win.
[1:05:27.600 --> 1:05:33.040]  And we have those incredible sell prices back at M4sTour.com, on M4 Select, swarable foods,
[1:05:33.040 --> 1:05:37.680]  they've got special diet foods, they've got three month supplies, year supplies, weak
[1:05:37.680 --> 1:05:41.760]  emergency supplies, they've got so many great products there, and you've got a three year
[1:05:41.760 --> 1:05:42.760]  supply.
[1:05:42.760 --> 1:05:47.280]  If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block, it's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[1:05:47.280 --> 1:05:52.080]  You're buying war bonds, bringing great products, and together, with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[1:05:52.080 --> 1:06:07.280]  M4sTour.com, and M4 Select, high quality swarble foods, powered by my patriot supply.
[1:06:07.280 --> 1:06:13.600]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:06:13.600 --> 1:06:23.320]  Okay, I intend to open the phones up, at the bottom of the hour, on any subject, any issue
[1:06:23.320 --> 1:06:24.320]  you want to discuss.
[1:06:24.320 --> 1:06:30.920]  We're right smack dab in the middle, well it's really kicked off, of the 50 hour broadcasts
[1:06:30.920 --> 1:06:35.320]  that started at 8am this morning with David Knight, and we'll run until Saturday morning
[1:06:35.320 --> 1:06:41.920]  at 10am, that's 50 hour global transmission, I'm Alex Jones, your host, you go to M4sTour.com,
[1:06:41.920 --> 1:06:44.960]  there's a live feed article posted, and then we're telling you the big guests that are
[1:06:44.960 --> 1:06:50.520]  coming up, a lot of big surprises, Joe thinks she'll be in studio of his planes on time
[1:06:50.520 --> 1:06:55.640]  at 2pm tomorrow, but regardless, we've got Joe Rogan coming in, a lot of stuff here on
[1:06:55.640 --> 1:07:06.440]  air, we've got Tom Papert coming up, George Norrie, Doug Hagman, Alyssa Andra Bocci,
[1:07:06.440 --> 1:07:16.600]  Ali Alexander, Julia Song, Carpe, Donkton, Will Johnson, Laura Loomer, Caitlyn Bennett,
[1:07:16.600 --> 1:07:21.600]  Sabo, Paul Joseph Watson, Gerald Salente, Mike Adams, Millie Weaver, Tommy Robinson,
[1:07:21.600 --> 1:07:30.360]  Fleckis Talks, and so many more, right through Saturday, and it's a focus on the attack on
[1:07:30.360 --> 1:07:36.200]  the First Amendment throughout the transmission, particularly during the evening, and codifying
[1:07:36.200 --> 1:07:44.480]  a political battle plan to counter the censorship and to beat the drums in Congress at the state
[1:07:44.480 --> 1:07:47.720]  level to counter that, and you've got Attorney Generals at the state level getting ready
[1:07:47.720 --> 1:07:51.400]  to take action, we'll play that next segment, you've got top generals saying China is working
[1:07:51.400 --> 1:07:55.720]  with Google, which we already know, but now it's coming out just how far the treason's
[1:07:55.720 --> 1:08:05.200]  gone, it's amazing, but I want to play a report, now this is like a 13 minute report, so we
[1:08:05.200 --> 1:08:10.760]  are going to play like 7, 8 minutes, 7, what's left of the segment, the full reports on infowars.com,
[1:08:10.760 --> 1:08:16.040]  and seeing it's even more powerful, but radio lizards can hear it, our reporter, Caitlyn
[1:08:16.040 --> 1:08:20.280]  Bennett, goes out, and this is not where she interviewed 100 people, and then Sherry picked
[1:08:20.280 --> 1:08:25.440]  this, this is liberals, this is people at universities, this is libtards, almost none
[1:08:25.440 --> 1:08:32.120]  of them know who Robert Francis O'Rourke is, but they're Beto supporters, they don't know
[1:08:32.120 --> 1:08:35.600]  his father-in-law is worth 27 billion, or his wife's worth a billion, or they never
[1:08:35.600 --> 1:08:39.240]  worked a day in his life, or that he hit and run drunk driver, or that he's a psychotic
[1:08:39.240 --> 1:08:45.680]  who believes he's God, no, they just want to believe that oh this guy's big in the media,
[1:08:45.680 --> 1:08:51.880]  I just met him, I'm somebody, I mean it's just a joke, so here's Caitlyn Bennett talking
[1:08:51.880 --> 1:08:55.760]  to these poor millennials, and not all millennials are like this, but let me tell you, a large
[1:08:55.760 --> 1:09:00.760]  portion of them are zombie idiots with no drive, no sense of anything, they're just
[1:09:00.760 --> 1:09:03.840]  like P.V. Hitch, so here is the shocking truth.
[1:09:03.840 --> 1:09:07.880]  What do you think about Robert Francis O'Rourke running for president?
[1:09:07.880 --> 1:09:10.360]  I don't know Robert Francis, I don't know.
[1:09:10.360 --> 1:09:12.840]  So you guys have heard of Beto, but not Robert?
[1:09:12.840 --> 1:09:14.840]  Nah, yeah, Beto, but not Robert, yeah.
[1:09:14.840 --> 1:09:19.920]  Well, Robert actually has been charged with a DUI, he's been arrested for burglary, and
[1:09:19.920 --> 1:09:23.240]  he has expressed desire to run over children with his car.
[1:09:23.240 --> 1:09:27.000]  Oh, that's just not a good desire to have, I don't think, yeah, I don't know.
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:29.000]  Would you say that Robert's better than Beto?
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:31.720]  I don't know, I like Beto, I like Beto.
[1:09:31.720 --> 1:09:32.720]  But not Robert.
[1:09:32.720 --> 1:09:35.000]  Not Robert, from what I know, you know.
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:36.000]  They're the same person.
[1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:38.000]  I just don't know enough information.
[1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  They're the same person.
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:40.000]  They're the same person.
[1:09:40.000 --> 1:09:41.000]  They're the same person.
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:48.040]  Wow, she got me good, she got me good.
[1:09:48.040 --> 1:09:59.360]  We're back in St. Augustine.
[1:09:59.360 --> 1:10:04.600]  Robert Francis Rourke, an Irish man, has tried tricking low IQ Democrats into thinking he's
[1:10:04.600 --> 1:10:08.240]  a Hispanic by saying his name is now Beto.
[1:10:08.240 --> 1:10:10.400]  Let's see how many people actually fell for it.
[1:10:10.400 --> 1:10:13.520]  What do you guys think about Beto, a Rourke, who's running for president?
[1:10:13.520 --> 1:10:19.240]  I mean, he seems like a pretty chill dude, it's kind of nice too, so I don't, I mean,
[1:10:19.240 --> 1:10:23.280]  I'm generally like more Republican, but I think he seems pretty cool.
[1:10:23.280 --> 1:10:26.040]  I don't know much, but I know that he's a good guy.
[1:10:26.040 --> 1:10:27.040]  He's a good guy.
[1:10:27.040 --> 1:10:28.960]  Yeah, he's like a family man, that's all I know.
[1:10:28.960 --> 1:10:34.000]  A family man, perfect, okay, so what do you guys think about Robert Francis Rourke, who's
[1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:35.000]  running for president?
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:36.480]  I don't know who that is.
[1:10:36.480 --> 1:10:37.720]  Neither do I, no clue.
[1:10:37.720 --> 1:10:42.960]  So Robert is known for expressing desire to run over children with his car.
[1:10:42.960 --> 1:10:46.840]  He has been charged with a DUI and he has been arrested for burglary.
[1:10:46.840 --> 1:10:48.520]  Do you think that's a family man?
[1:10:48.520 --> 1:10:49.520]  Definitely not.
[1:10:49.520 --> 1:10:51.720]  And it sounds like a terrible person.
[1:10:51.720 --> 1:10:55.880]  What if I told you that Beto, a Rourke, and Robert Francis, a Rourke are the same person?
[1:10:55.880 --> 1:10:57.880]  They didn't even say that.
[1:10:57.880 --> 1:11:02.480]  I knew it because the last one, I guess that changed my mind on him.
[1:11:02.480 --> 1:11:05.400]  What do you think about Beto, a Rourke?
[1:11:05.400 --> 1:11:08.960]  I really like Beto.
[1:11:08.960 --> 1:11:13.440]  I think he's done a really good job of galvanizing his base, getting his message out.
[1:11:13.440 --> 1:11:19.680]  I think he's got a ways to go to get at some of the more established candidates, but I
[1:11:19.680 --> 1:11:21.480]  think he's got a lot of the enthusiasm.
[1:11:21.480 --> 1:11:26.200]  It's sort of reminiscent of Obama, the way he can whip up a crowd.
[1:11:26.200 --> 1:11:30.360]  What do you guys think about Robert Francis, a Rourke, who's running for president?
[1:11:30.360 --> 1:11:32.880]  I don't have a lot of exposure to him.
[1:11:32.880 --> 1:11:35.080]  I really like Beto.
[1:11:35.080 --> 1:11:37.840]  What do you think about Beto, a Rourke, that's running?
[1:11:37.840 --> 1:11:44.120]  I feel like Beto, a Rourke, is basically one of the best young Democrats running, and he
[1:11:44.120 --> 1:11:56.960]  has the most political power over what Trump's, what Trump, this kabob-related system that
[1:11:56.960 --> 1:11:58.160]  he has.
[1:11:58.160 --> 1:12:04.280]  He speaks a lot of the truth, and he speaks to the people, what they absolutely want at
[1:12:04.280 --> 1:12:07.000]  all times, and that's what I love about him.
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:11.960]  What's one of his policies that you like?
[1:12:11.960 --> 1:12:15.600]  Basically just...
[1:12:15.600 --> 1:12:21.280]  What do you think about Robert Francis, a Rourke, who has decided to run for president as well?
[1:12:21.280 --> 1:12:25.840]  Yeah, that's a good chance.
[1:12:25.840 --> 1:12:30.680]  He's very detailed on what the people need.
[1:12:30.680 --> 1:12:31.680]  What do you like?
[1:12:31.680 --> 1:12:32.680]  Who do you like more?
[1:12:32.680 --> 1:12:33.680]  Beto or Robert?
[1:12:33.680 --> 1:12:34.680]  Oh, Beto.
[1:12:34.680 --> 1:12:35.680]  All day.
[1:12:35.680 --> 1:12:41.040]  So, something about Robert that I wanted to let you know and get people's opinions are,
[1:12:41.040 --> 1:12:47.120]  he actually has been charged with a DUI, he's been arrested for burglary, and he has expressed
[1:12:47.120 --> 1:12:50.120]  desire to run over children with a car.
[1:12:50.120 --> 1:12:53.080]  This has come out within the last few weeks.
[1:12:53.080 --> 1:12:54.880]  What do you think about that?
[1:12:54.880 --> 1:12:59.280]  Do you think that should disqualify him?
[1:12:59.280 --> 1:13:07.400]  I think that from one to ten, to be disqualified, I put it as a five, because he really has
[1:13:07.400 --> 1:13:15.640]  to explain himself and explain himself about why he chose that, why he was who he was at
[1:13:15.640 --> 1:13:17.320]  that time.
[1:13:17.320 --> 1:13:19.240]  Let me tell you who he was at that time.
[1:13:19.240 --> 1:13:21.320]  He was Beto, a Rourke.
[1:13:21.320 --> 1:13:22.640]  Those were the same people.
[1:13:22.640 --> 1:13:24.640]  Yeah, he really was.
[1:13:24.640 --> 1:13:25.640]  He really was.
[1:13:25.640 --> 1:13:26.640]  Those are the same people.
[1:13:26.640 --> 1:13:28.320]  Beto and Robert, a Rourke.
[1:13:28.320 --> 1:13:29.840]  Those are the same people.
[1:13:29.840 --> 1:13:35.880]  What Robert did was he gave himself a nickname to sound more Hispanic, because Beto is a
[1:13:35.880 --> 1:13:41.240]  nickname for the Hispanic named Roberto, to try to garner Hispanic votes in Texas.
[1:13:41.240 --> 1:13:42.240]  Yes, ma'am.
[1:13:42.240 --> 1:13:43.740]  Do you think that's inappropriate?
[1:13:43.740 --> 1:13:44.740]  It's very inappropriate.
[1:13:44.740 --> 1:13:47.480]  Does that change your mind on Beto a little bit?
[1:13:47.480 --> 1:13:54.080]  It changes my mind a lot, because you shouldn't have to change who you are to be, you know,
[1:13:54.080 --> 1:13:56.080]  to be somebody popular in the United States.
[1:13:56.080 --> 1:14:05.800]  Do you know who Irishman Robert a Rourke is?
[1:14:05.800 --> 1:14:07.160]  What do you think about Beto a Rourke?
[1:14:07.160 --> 1:14:08.400]  Have you heard about him running?
[1:14:08.400 --> 1:14:13.240]  Yeah, I actually go to college in Oklahoma, so we sort of followed his race against Ted
[1:14:13.240 --> 1:14:14.960]  Cruz earlier on.
[1:14:14.960 --> 1:14:18.760]  What do you think about Robert Francis a Rourke, who's running for president?
[1:14:18.760 --> 1:14:21.240]  I haven't heard that he was running for president.
[1:14:21.240 --> 1:14:25.320]  Would you say Beto is a better candidate than Robert Francis a Rourke?
[1:14:25.320 --> 1:14:26.320]  Easily.
[1:14:26.320 --> 1:14:31.600]  What if I told you those were the same person?
[1:14:31.600 --> 1:14:36.920]  I guess I'd be kind of surprised, because I wouldn't think anybody would even think
[1:14:36.920 --> 1:14:40.640]  he had a chance running against Ted Cruz just for the Senate seat.
[1:14:40.640 --> 1:14:43.240]  So Robert Francis a Rourke is Beto a Rourke.
[1:14:43.240 --> 1:14:49.000]  He changed his name, he developed this nickname, because in the Hispanic community, Beto is
[1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:53.400]  a nickname for the Hispanic named Roberto, and he wants to garner their votes.
[1:14:53.400 --> 1:14:57.120]  Okay, we're going to go to break, and we're going to come back with what should have been
[1:14:57.120 --> 1:14:58.120]  my top story.
[1:14:58.120 --> 1:14:59.120]  I saw this this morning.
[1:14:59.120 --> 1:15:03.880]  I meant to be my top story, speaking of Beto, because this is the future of the planet under
[1:15:03.880 --> 1:15:10.360]  these globalist brainwashing systems, if we let this continue.
[1:15:10.360 --> 1:15:15.520]  People think that Governor of Virginia just misspoke when he said we kill babies after
[1:15:15.520 --> 1:15:16.520]  they're born.
[1:15:16.520 --> 1:15:19.720]  Now he's a medical doctor that deals with that specifically.
[1:15:19.720 --> 1:15:21.800]  It's organ harvesting.
[1:15:21.800 --> 1:15:26.040]  But now Democrats everywhere saying, no, no, no, we agree, kill babies after they're born.
[1:15:26.040 --> 1:15:30.040]  Well after our own Millie Weaver brought it up a few days ago and became national news,
[1:15:30.040 --> 1:15:35.280]  he got picked up by Fox News, Ben Shapiro, you name it, a student asked Beto last night
[1:15:35.280 --> 1:15:36.280]  about it.
[1:15:36.280 --> 1:15:40.400]  And he said, no, we kill them after they're, I don't do a very good invitation, but we
[1:15:40.400 --> 1:15:46.920]  do it for the mommy, kill a baby for the mommy, women, I like women.
[1:15:46.920 --> 1:15:51.960]  The baby can stay alive, but he's like, no, kill, but it's out of the body.
[1:15:51.960 --> 1:15:52.960]  It's safe.
[1:15:52.960 --> 1:15:53.960]  No.
[1:15:53.960 --> 1:15:54.960]  Kill.
[1:15:54.960 --> 1:15:55.960]  Baby.
[1:15:55.960 --> 1:15:56.960]  I got big butt teeth.
[1:15:56.960 --> 1:15:57.960]  It's okay.
[1:15:57.960 --> 1:16:02.840]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the
[1:16:02.840 --> 1:16:03.840]  world.
[1:16:03.840 --> 1:16:06.600]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[1:16:06.600 --> 1:16:12.560]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[1:16:12.560 --> 1:16:17.680]  As former colony, the U.S. had to save the empire.
[1:16:17.680 --> 1:16:18.680]  Was there ever a vote?
[1:16:18.680 --> 1:16:19.680]  Who do we fight for?
[1:16:19.680 --> 1:16:25.480]  The deep state began with World War I, the United States of Empire, by James Dunne, available

[1:17:02.520 --> 1:17:06.200]  may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[1:17:06.200 --> 1:17:11.200]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are

[1:17:27.840 --> 1:17:28.840]  healthier I feel.
[1:17:28.840 --> 1:17:31.480]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.

[1:17:58.640 --> 1:18:03.520]  There are thousands of ideologies out there, hundreds of different political systems and
[1:18:03.520 --> 1:18:06.560]  most of them are funded by the globalist.
[1:18:06.560 --> 1:18:09.240]  Global wars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[1:18:09.240 --> 1:18:12.640]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[1:18:12.640 --> 1:18:17.400]  I didn't invent all this, I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana, and what really
[1:18:17.400 --> 1:18:22.000]  works for humanity and I'm simply trying to bring it back, and lo and behold it's super
[1:18:22.000 --> 1:18:24.920]  popular like it's always been.
[1:18:24.920 --> 1:18:28.920]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately because we have the

[1:18:42.960 --> 1:18:46.360]  for this nation and the world for peace and discernment.
[1:18:46.360 --> 1:18:50.280]  For myself and the whole Info Wars family, I want to thank all of you for what you've
[1:18:50.280 --> 1:18:54.200]  done because without you, Info Wars is nothing.

[1:18:58.160 --> 1:19:04.760]  I've got some really good news though, X2 is back, the original X2, Deep Breath Crystal,
[1:19:04.760 --> 1:19:11.120]  pure atomic iodine, what you want, InfoWarsStore.com, it'll be here in a week, manufactured in
[1:19:11.120 --> 1:19:15.800]  the US, InfoWarsStore.com, with the best iodine in the world, X2 is available.
[1:19:15.800 --> 1:19:19.520]  I thought X3 is great, we still got another Deep Breath Crystal source, but I thought
[1:19:19.520 --> 1:19:23.600]  add the other two types of iodine, the scientists that do that, it sold a lot that people want
[1:19:23.600 --> 1:19:28.440]  original X2, well I was resigned the fact we didn't have X2, but it came through about
[1:19:28.440 --> 1:19:34.240]  a month ago, we now have X2 again at InfoWarsStore.com, so hallelujah, it's been sold out for about
[1:19:34.240 --> 1:19:40.960]  almost three months, but we have now had the same company, the original X2, develop it
[1:19:40.960 --> 1:19:47.400]  again, and we were able to do the exact same formula, we want to pre-order X2, the ultimate
[1:19:47.400 --> 1:19:51.360]  iodine out there, learn about the iodine conspiracy, learn about IQs dropping when
[1:19:51.360 --> 1:19:56.920]  you don't have it, learn about how the other iodines are bound, get here today at InfoWarsStore.com

[1:20:02.040 --> 1:20:09.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:20:09.560 --> 1:20:15.920]  In today's world, abortion supporters routinely attend pro-life rallies and attempt to bully
[1:20:15.920 --> 1:20:23.160]  activists, if you have a problem and need a smelly group of commie devil worshipers,
[1:20:23.160 --> 1:20:25.560]  maybe you can call the A-team.
[1:20:25.560 --> 1:20:29.560]  How many did I insult?
[1:20:29.560 --> 1:20:30.840]  I killed my kids.
[1:20:30.840 --> 1:20:31.840]  I killed my kids.
[1:20:31.840 --> 1:20:39.840]  So why the f*** are you facing a f***ing male that doesn't stand for women's rights?
[1:20:39.840 --> 1:20:45.160]  Hey, we saw your face, but with your communist hammer and sickle, that's pretty cool, man.
[1:20:45.160 --> 1:20:48.960]  Is that you on the Facebook?
[1:20:48.960 --> 1:20:51.160]  Is there a Facebook page of you with a hammer and sickle?
[1:20:51.160 --> 1:20:52.160]  I don't think so.
[1:20:52.160 --> 1:20:53.160]  I don't understand.
[1:20:53.160 --> 1:20:54.160]  I f***ing love things.
[1:20:54.160 --> 1:20:55.160]  How do you get your abortion paper?
[1:20:55.160 --> 1:20:56.160]  I pay for them.
[1:20:56.160 --> 1:20:57.160]  I thought you said three.
[1:20:57.160 --> 1:20:58.160]  I mean, pay for them.
[1:20:58.160 --> 1:20:59.160]  Upwards of 50.
[1:20:59.160 --> 1:21:00.160]  Really?
[1:21:00.160 --> 1:21:01.160]  Oh, yeah.
[1:21:01.160 --> 1:21:02.160]  Oh!
[1:21:02.160 --> 1:21:03.160]  F*** you, you piece of s***!
[1:21:03.160 --> 1:21:04.160]  F*** you!
[1:21:04.160 --> 1:21:05.160]  F*** you!
[1:21:05.160 --> 1:21:06.160]  F*** you!
[1:21:06.160 --> 1:21:07.160]  F*** you!
[1:21:07.160 --> 1:21:08.160]  F*** you!
[1:21:08.160 --> 1:21:09.160]  F*** you!
[1:21:09.160 --> 1:21:10.160]  F*** you!
[1:21:10.160 --> 1:21:11.160]  F*** you!
[1:21:11.160 --> 1:21:12.160]  F*** you!
[1:21:12.160 --> 1:21:13.160]  F*** you!
[1:21:13.160 --> 1:21:14.160]  F*** you!
[1:21:14.160 --> 1:21:15.160]  F*** you!
[1:21:15.160 --> 1:21:17.200]  Bunch of misogynistic motherf***ers.
[1:21:17.200 --> 1:21:19.200]  Take your male privilege somewhere else.
[1:21:19.200 --> 1:21:20.320]  Probably, you've been aggressive.
[1:21:20.320 --> 1:21:21.320]  I'm being aggressive.
[1:21:21.320 --> 1:21:22.320]  Come on!
[1:21:22.320 --> 1:21:23.320]  In the eyes!
[1:21:23.320 --> 1:21:24.320]  Get news of!
[1:21:24.320 --> 1:21:25.320]  Wow!
[1:21:25.320 --> 1:21:26.320]  Watch out!
[1:21:26.320 --> 1:21:39.120]  These thefts are guys that attack Alex Jones.
[1:21:39.120 --> 1:21:43.120]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[1:21:43.120 --> 1:21:59.520]  Governor Northam, a couple months ago, seems like a thousand years ago, was a medical doctor
[1:21:59.520 --> 1:22:06.400]  that's overseeing neonatal units and the harvesting, keeping the little buggers healthy
[1:22:06.400 --> 1:22:13.040]  and safe while we get all the little chitlins and livers out of them, all the little giblets.
[1:22:13.040 --> 1:22:14.400]  Very sick.
[1:22:14.400 --> 1:22:21.240]  Now they want to keep babies alive, but under bioethics, they wave a magic wand.
[1:22:21.240 --> 1:22:25.040]  That's what replaced the Hippocratic Oath about 15 years ago, all over Europe and the
[1:22:25.040 --> 1:22:26.040]  U.S.
[1:22:26.040 --> 1:22:28.400]  Now they wave a magic wand in two doctors.
[1:22:28.400 --> 1:22:33.440]  That constitutes a bioethics board now under federal and state law.
[1:22:33.440 --> 1:22:38.920]  They decide the baby isn't a human and isn't viable, even though it's totally healthy.
[1:22:38.920 --> 1:22:43.480]  And if the mother decides to keep it, then they wave a wand and they call it resuscitation.
[1:22:43.480 --> 1:22:44.880]  That's actually a legal term.
[1:22:44.880 --> 1:22:46.520]  They're not actually resuscitating it.
[1:22:46.520 --> 1:22:48.680]  They're just now saying, okay, now it's alive.
[1:22:48.680 --> 1:22:52.480]  They're waving a wand and saying it's a human, then the baby stays alive.
[1:22:52.480 --> 1:22:59.320]  But if they can trick mama, they can then take the tissue to a special wing where they
[1:22:59.320 --> 1:23:05.040]  keep the baby comfortable until they can get all the orders in in the next week or so
[1:23:05.040 --> 1:23:08.800]  for who wants a liver, who wants a kidney, who wants the different things they're needed
[1:23:08.800 --> 1:23:11.000]  and they then render that baby down to nothing.
[1:23:11.000 --> 1:23:15.040]  And that's done all over Europe, all over China, all over the U.S. now and it's come
[1:23:15.040 --> 1:23:16.040]  out in federal court.
[1:23:16.040 --> 1:23:20.200]  So they've got a problem because it's coming out.
[1:23:20.200 --> 1:23:24.120]  See before it was so horrible and so macabre and so nightmare and just, you know, out
[1:23:24.120 --> 1:23:27.880]  of Crypt Keeper, no one could believe it.
[1:23:27.880 --> 1:23:30.760]  So no one would investigate because it was happening in plain view because no one could
[1:23:30.760 --> 1:23:32.600]  believe something that evil is happening.
[1:23:32.600 --> 1:23:34.960]  You understand how that works?
[1:23:34.960 --> 1:23:40.120]  But now because it's coming out, they've got to go, oh, well, of course we keep them alive.
[1:23:40.120 --> 1:23:44.560]  And so they've got five states set to pass laws, New York's passed a law where they keep
[1:23:44.560 --> 1:23:45.560]  babies alive.
[1:23:45.560 --> 1:23:48.600]  So Beto O'Rourke gets questioned two days ago by Millie Weaver.
[1:23:48.600 --> 1:23:50.480]  It goes viral, tens of millions of years.
[1:23:50.480 --> 1:23:56.240]  It's all over Fox News, all over everything because he looks right at her and says, no,
[1:23:56.240 --> 1:24:01.560]  that's a woman's decision even though the baby's already born, could live out of the womb.
[1:24:01.560 --> 1:24:04.040]  That's actually changing former federal and state law.
[1:24:04.040 --> 1:24:06.960]  In fact, it runs against those laws.
[1:24:06.960 --> 1:24:10.240]  There are abortionists who got caught keeping babies alive who were in prison and they're
[1:24:10.240 --> 1:24:12.720]  trying to use the new laws to get out of prison.
[1:24:12.720 --> 1:24:14.120]  That's in my stack today.
[1:24:14.120 --> 1:24:20.960]  Well, now Beto refuses to support law to protect babies that survive abortion.
[1:24:20.960 --> 1:24:24.800]  There are a lot of famous people that have survived abortions who Christian groups dug
[1:24:24.800 --> 1:24:29.080]  out of trash dumpsters back before they sold the parts.
[1:24:29.080 --> 1:24:32.160]  There are very famous people that are on the top circuit.
[1:24:32.160 --> 1:24:33.160]  They speak at universities.
[1:24:33.160 --> 1:24:41.000]  We've had them on who survived eight, nine months abortions, had their skin burned off
[1:24:41.000 --> 1:24:44.280]  using the salt solution that makes the body abort.
[1:24:44.280 --> 1:24:46.200]  And it's not a medical procedure.
[1:24:46.200 --> 1:24:49.280]  It's not save the life of the mother procedure because she would just cut the baby out of
[1:24:49.280 --> 1:24:50.440]  that was the case.
[1:24:50.440 --> 1:24:55.680]  They flamed broil them with acid and I'm sorry this is so horrible to talk about.
[1:24:55.680 --> 1:24:56.680]  It's the reality.
[1:24:56.680 --> 1:25:00.880]  So there are living people in the U.S. who survived abortions.
[1:25:00.880 --> 1:25:04.000]  Not anymore, you can now be killed after you're born.
[1:25:04.000 --> 1:25:05.880]  Then you can kill grandma when she's old.
[1:25:05.880 --> 1:25:07.600]  So this is euthanasia.
[1:25:07.600 --> 1:25:09.000]  This is eugenics.
[1:25:09.000 --> 1:25:10.000]  This is pure death.
[1:25:10.000 --> 1:25:12.280]  So remember the governor when he said it.
[1:25:12.280 --> 1:25:17.800]  He wasn't slipping up and Peter O'Rourke doesn't just want to rape your kids.
[1:25:17.800 --> 1:25:18.800]  He wants them dead.
[1:25:18.800 --> 1:25:24.440]  Beto, Peter, whatever you want to call him, Beto O'Rourke, minion of the globalist.
[1:25:24.440 --> 1:25:29.160]  He now is doubling down agreeing with the governor because this is their official policy.
[1:25:29.160 --> 1:25:30.660]  Here's the governor.
[1:25:30.660 --> 1:25:35.720]  So in this particular example, if a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would
[1:25:35.720 --> 1:25:37.000]  happen.
[1:25:37.000 --> 1:25:39.040]  The infant would be delivered.
[1:25:39.040 --> 1:25:41.480]  The infant would be kept comfortable.
[1:25:41.480 --> 1:25:46.640]  The infant would be resuscitated if that's what the mother and the family desired.
[1:25:46.640 --> 1:25:50.520]  And then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.
[1:25:50.520 --> 1:25:53.880]  So I think this was really blown out of proportion.
[1:25:53.880 --> 1:25:58.600]  But again, we want the government not to be involved in these types of decisions.
[1:25:58.600 --> 1:26:03.720]  We want the decision to be made by the mothers and their providers.
[1:26:03.720 --> 1:26:04.720]  And this is why...
[1:26:04.720 --> 1:26:06.760]  Okay, let's stop there.
[1:26:06.760 --> 1:26:11.400]  Of course, the medical facilities don't want government and the standing laws that you
[1:26:11.400 --> 1:26:14.760]  can't kill babies after they're born in place because they've already got abortion.
[1:26:14.760 --> 1:26:17.000]  Now they want post-birth abortion.
[1:26:17.000 --> 1:26:23.600]  And here's Beto O'Rourke, the stories up on infowars.com continuing to endorse this now
[1:26:23.600 --> 1:26:25.400]  official policy.
[1:26:25.400 --> 1:26:29.680]  The way I would approach your question and issue generally is to trust women to make
[1:26:29.680 --> 1:26:31.840]  their own decisions about their own bodies.
[1:26:31.840 --> 1:26:36.560]  No, it's the hospital coming in like ghouls to trick you.
[1:26:36.560 --> 1:26:40.600]  And hell, even a woman wants to kill her baby, doesn't she want part of that $300,000 on
[1:26:40.600 --> 1:26:41.600]  average?
[1:26:41.600 --> 1:26:45.040]  See, that's why they really want me off here because a lot of these women don't care.
[1:26:45.040 --> 1:26:48.480]  What about that cash value?
[1:26:48.480 --> 1:26:49.960]  That'll get some of these demon women upset.
[1:26:49.960 --> 1:26:55.240]  They're going to be like, I want some money off that liver, off my baby I killed.
[1:26:55.240 --> 1:26:59.160]  We get the Satanists fighting with each other and let the women know the price, it'll drive
[1:26:59.160 --> 1:27:01.920]  the price up and we may actually get this stuff outlawed.
[1:27:01.920 --> 1:27:05.880]  I know I'm an extremist, I know I'm saying don't kill babies after they're born.
[1:27:05.880 --> 1:27:06.880]  Here's the clip.
[1:27:06.880 --> 1:27:11.760]  I wanted to ask you about a recent bill that just went through the Senate about two weeks
[1:27:11.760 --> 1:27:12.760]  ago.
[1:27:12.760 --> 1:27:18.600]  And the bill was that if an abortion was performed on a viable fetus and the fetus survived the
[1:27:18.600 --> 1:27:24.240]  abortion, the doctor would then be compelled to give that living baby the same care as
[1:27:24.240 --> 1:27:29.800]  any other pregnancy baby that came out and put that baby through the care.
[1:27:29.800 --> 1:27:35.480]  Would you support this bill that does not in any way limit abortion and simply seeks
[1:27:35.480 --> 1:27:40.760]  to keep babies alive that have been born alive?
[1:27:40.760 --> 1:27:41.760]  Thank you for the question.
[1:27:41.760 --> 1:27:50.760]  The way that I would approach your question and this issue generally is to trust women
[1:27:50.760 --> 1:27:56.080]  to make their own decisions about their own bodies.
[1:27:56.080 --> 1:27:58.080]  Kill that baby out, it's on the table alive.
[1:27:58.080 --> 1:28:02.800]  The universal guarantee of high quality health care for everyone in this country, it's primary
[1:28:02.800 --> 1:28:06.040]  health care, it's mental health care, it's women's health care.
[1:28:06.040 --> 1:28:08.800]  So see how they move the goalpost.
[1:28:08.800 --> 1:28:12.040]  First it's not a human, then it's well it's a human but the mother can kill it after it's
[1:28:12.040 --> 1:28:13.040]  born.
[1:28:13.040 --> 1:28:18.040]  Okay, five minutes after, a week after, a month after, a year after, Peter Singer who's
[1:28:18.040 --> 1:28:23.360]  the intellectual head of PETA, he says kill kids up to age three and let bioethics boards
[1:28:23.360 --> 1:28:28.240]  decide if somebody's got value in their life and whether you're human or not and you just
[1:28:28.240 --> 1:28:29.240]  heard it.
[1:28:29.240 --> 1:28:33.280]  We'll keep them comfortable and then we'll decide whether to resuscitate, we'll decide
[1:28:33.280 --> 1:28:36.440]  whether to say this is a living person or not and we're just gonna sit here and take
[1:28:36.440 --> 1:28:44.760]  it while they mainline and the women are like, whoo, whoo, kill that baby after it's born
[1:28:44.760 --> 1:28:48.320]  and if it survives, give it Ritalin, give it Prozac, give it deadly vaccines and then
[1:28:48.320 --> 1:28:53.480]  let big fat drag queens have the kids sit on their lap because if we can't kill them,
[1:28:53.480 --> 1:28:54.480]  better just rape them.
[1:28:54.480 --> 1:28:57.400]  That's even better, to torture them and rape them, paedophilia.
[1:28:57.400 --> 1:28:58.600]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[1:28:58.600 --> 1:29:02.520]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[1:29:02.520 --> 1:29:04.040]  I sued the IRS in one.
[1:29:04.040 --> 1:29:07.000]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[1:29:07.000 --> 1:29:10.280]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with
[1:29:10.280 --> 1:29:12.520]  tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[1:29:12.520 --> 1:29:13.840]  I can help you too.
[1:29:13.840 --> 1:29:16.880]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[1:29:16.880 --> 1:29:19.120]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[1:29:19.120 --> 1:29:27.560]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.

[1:33:01.480 --> 1:33:08.480]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:33:08.480 --> 1:33:21.480]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:21.480 --> 1:33:35.280]  So, what do you make of Beto O'Rourke adopting the official new party platform of the Democratic
[1:33:35.280 --> 1:33:40.520]  Party to kill babies after they're born and are totally viable?
[1:33:40.520 --> 1:33:45.120]  They don't tell women that there are hundreds of charities, the biggest one's Catholic,
[1:33:45.120 --> 1:33:51.440]  that will get a woman a job and pay her up to $100,000 to have the baby and have a place
[1:33:51.440 --> 1:33:52.440]  for adoption.
[1:33:52.440 --> 1:33:59.560]  There are other high-end ones where some women get up to $300,000, that's just in the process
[1:33:59.560 --> 1:34:00.560]  themselves.
[1:34:00.560 --> 1:34:06.520]  So, if women don't get cold, hey, by the way, and I'm talking about Hispanic women, black
[1:34:06.520 --> 1:34:10.960]  women, white women, you name it, you can get paid to not abort your baby.
[1:34:10.960 --> 1:34:11.960]  No one knows that.
[1:34:11.960 --> 1:34:14.640]  There are some billboards up here and there.
[1:34:14.640 --> 1:34:20.840]  People don't know that there are more people wanting to adopt each year than there are
[1:34:20.840 --> 1:34:21.840]  babies aborted.
[1:34:21.840 --> 1:34:26.840]  That's why people have to go to Russia or South Korea to get babies or China.
[1:34:26.840 --> 1:34:28.640]  It's incredible.
[1:34:28.640 --> 1:34:33.320]  It's absolutely incredible that this is going on and they won't tell the women, and they
[1:34:33.320 --> 1:34:37.440]  won't tell the women, by the way, they're selling your baby's organs when their third
[1:34:37.440 --> 1:34:40.800]  trimester or now post birth abortion.
[1:34:40.800 --> 1:34:47.440]  Because, again, all these hospitals sell the blood, sell the tissue, and it's put into
[1:34:47.440 --> 1:34:53.680]  cosmetics and other products, but if they can keep them alive, folks, they get a lot
[1:34:53.680 --> 1:34:58.080]  of money, but again, they consider them dead tissue.
[1:34:58.080 --> 1:35:04.960]  They wave a wand, check a box, and say, resuscitated, the baby lives, but the baby's alive.
[1:35:04.960 --> 1:35:10.360]  It's all semantical games, and this is all bioethics, this is how they think they get
[1:35:10.360 --> 1:35:11.360]  away with it.
[1:35:11.360 --> 1:35:14.680]  That's why the governor of Virginia keeps saying, we don't want the police involved,
[1:35:14.680 --> 1:35:17.400]  we don't want Congress involved, we don't want government involved.
[1:35:17.400 --> 1:35:23.200]  You know, this is the woman and her doctors, because they're encroaching on law.
[1:35:23.200 --> 1:35:24.200]  Why not?
[1:35:24.200 --> 1:35:28.000]  They already can kill babies before they're born, why not kill them after?
[1:35:28.000 --> 1:35:35.000]  And then the women are like, woo, I got a new right to kill babies after they're born.
[1:35:35.000 --> 1:35:40.240]  But if you tell these witches, hey, you can get a lot of money for adopting the baby,
[1:35:40.240 --> 1:35:41.680]  they do it.
[1:35:41.680 --> 1:35:47.360]  Or if you tell these leftist witches, hey, you know, when they gut your son or daughter,
[1:35:47.360 --> 1:35:50.800]  you could get half that money, a couple hundred foul.
[1:35:50.800 --> 1:35:55.720]  But you see, and it's so immoral, though, that once people find out that women are having
[1:35:55.720 --> 1:35:57.720]  kids to have them gutted, you'll get outlawed.
[1:35:57.720 --> 1:36:01.600]  But let me tell you, these women, they'll gut their kids all day.
[1:36:01.600 --> 1:36:04.480]  Boy, you think, you don't think the average leftist woman wouldn't have a baby to get
[1:36:04.480 --> 1:36:05.480]  $300,000?
[1:36:05.480 --> 1:36:09.000]  She'd probably sit there and piss on her kid while they were getting their guts chopped
[1:36:09.000 --> 1:36:10.000]  out.
[1:36:10.000 --> 1:36:11.800]  I'm serious, these people love evil.
[1:36:11.800 --> 1:36:15.360]  You mean to play a bunch of clips around the country of leftist women going, I love
[1:36:15.360 --> 1:36:19.720]  Satan, I love the devil, I love killing my kids, hail Satan.
[1:36:19.720 --> 1:36:22.560]  You got to understand, they hate you and your family.
[1:36:22.560 --> 1:36:23.800]  They hate God.
[1:36:23.800 --> 1:36:25.040]  They hate this country.
[1:36:25.040 --> 1:36:26.160]  They hate life.
[1:36:26.160 --> 1:36:30.120]  They're turned over to the devil just like the Bible says.
[1:36:30.120 --> 1:36:35.080]  And the sooner you figure that out, the sooner they'll stop ruling us and hurting our children.
[1:36:35.080 --> 1:36:41.560]  I said I'd take calls and never give a number out to the chagrin of the producers and folks
[1:36:41.560 --> 1:36:42.560]  in there.
[1:36:42.560 --> 1:36:48.160]  I'd take calls this hour and the next hour because Tom Papert is a great TV station manager
[1:36:48.160 --> 1:36:51.160]  where he carries our show, but also a talk show host in his own right.
[1:36:51.160 --> 1:36:52.160]  And so he's going to be joining us.
[1:36:52.160 --> 1:36:53.160]  He'll be happy to take calls.
[1:36:53.160 --> 1:36:56.520]  I want to hear from you on Beto.
[1:36:56.520 --> 1:37:01.680]  You know, I don't wish any harm against Beto or Rorick or against the governor of Virginia,
[1:37:01.680 --> 1:37:08.840]  but imagine if somebody, God forbid, just hypothetically grabbed them and they're all
[1:37:08.840 --> 1:37:13.680]  chained down in a warehouse somewhere and it's a medical doctor that kidnapped them.
[1:37:13.680 --> 1:37:16.160]  And the medical doctor has another medical doctor and he goes, well, there's two of us.
[1:37:16.160 --> 1:37:20.360]  We're a bioethics board, like the governor said, and we decided you're not alive.
[1:37:20.360 --> 1:37:21.360]  You're a ball of flesh.
[1:37:21.360 --> 1:37:26.160]  So we're going to start harvesting your kidneys and stuff while you're awake and let you watch
[1:37:26.160 --> 1:37:28.080]  it.
[1:37:28.080 --> 1:37:31.800]  And while you beg for your life, we go, man, this corpse is talking a lot.
[1:37:31.800 --> 1:37:35.600]  Oh, could we put your kidneys back in you and let you go?
[1:37:35.600 --> 1:37:36.600]  Wave a wand.
[1:37:36.600 --> 1:37:38.560]  You're a resuscitated governor.
[1:37:38.560 --> 1:37:40.200]  You can survive.
[1:37:40.200 --> 1:37:41.680]  People are like, whoa, that's really extreme.
[1:37:41.680 --> 1:37:46.960]  Talk about, you know, the governor being gutted by two doctors in a basement or a warehouse.
[1:37:46.960 --> 1:37:48.960]  But see, that's a baby.
[1:37:48.960 --> 1:37:49.960]  It can't walk.
[1:37:49.960 --> 1:37:50.960]  It can't defend itself.
[1:37:50.960 --> 1:37:53.440]  It's just like, yeah, kill that bugger.
[1:37:53.440 --> 1:37:58.960]  Jones is out of control because the truth is so horrible.
[1:37:58.960 --> 1:38:02.600]  You'd go crazy like me if you cared.
[1:38:02.600 --> 1:38:04.040]  And I'm not talking to our average listener.
[1:38:04.040 --> 1:38:09.800]  I'm talking to the folks that listen to NPR and the establishment types and all the wannabe
[1:38:09.800 --> 1:38:13.360]  tough guy liberal lawyers and all of you people who say you have the moral high ground.
[1:38:13.360 --> 1:38:14.840]  You have no moral high ground.
[1:38:14.840 --> 1:38:20.560]  You're in a bunch of wicked, evil race division pushing control freaks bought and paid for
[1:38:20.560 --> 1:38:26.880]  by the most evil corporations in the world to bring in the end of the human age.
[1:38:26.880 --> 1:38:28.000]  And guess what, Jack?
[1:38:28.000 --> 1:38:29.000]  You failed.
[1:38:29.000 --> 1:38:30.000]  It ain't gonna work.
[1:38:30.000 --> 1:38:40.400]  The toll free number to join us on any of the issues we raised 877-789 Alex 877-789-2539.
[1:38:40.400 --> 1:38:45.520]  You imagine God forbid, because I'm a nonviolent guy, if somebody grabbed the governor of Virginia
[1:38:45.520 --> 1:38:51.040]  and took him and then while he was awake, chained down, cut his organs out like I do
[1:38:51.040 --> 1:38:56.240]  these babies and asked him how he liked it.
[1:38:56.240 --> 1:39:01.960]  I wonder if he'd say, well, keep me comfortable, well, we'll keep you comfortable, all right.
[1:39:01.960 --> 1:39:07.560]  I mean, how would he like it if they took power drills to his knees?
[1:39:07.560 --> 1:39:08.560]  Power drills to you.
[1:39:08.560 --> 1:39:10.680]  Because these are babies you're doing this to.
[1:39:10.680 --> 1:39:12.280]  You're chopping them up.
[1:39:12.280 --> 1:39:17.720]  But all because you got that fake southern accent, it's okay.
[1:39:17.720 --> 1:39:18.720]  All an act.
[1:39:18.720 --> 1:39:19.720]  I love the South.
[1:39:19.720 --> 1:39:20.720]  Good people there.
[1:39:20.720 --> 1:39:25.040]  Texas is kind of the gateway of the South either way.
[1:39:25.040 --> 1:39:31.040]  But there's a fake type of southerner that has these real sweet little voices and it's
[1:39:31.040 --> 1:39:35.280]  all about scamming the common people and keeping everybody alive.
[1:39:35.280 --> 1:39:37.360]  Let me tell you something.
[1:39:37.360 --> 1:39:42.040]  In the South, East Texas, it's the South, the people that talk like that, you don't
[1:39:42.040 --> 1:39:44.400]  want to trust them, all right.
[1:39:44.400 --> 1:39:48.240]  He's a piece of filth.
[1:39:48.240 --> 1:39:50.240]  And all I want is the babies protected.
[1:39:50.240 --> 1:39:54.560]  But imagine how taboo it is to hear me talk about people kidnapping and torturing to death
[1:39:54.560 --> 1:39:57.640]  a governor, which I don't want to happen.
[1:39:57.640 --> 1:39:59.680]  But see, we talk about killing babies all day after they're born.
[1:39:59.680 --> 1:40:02.160]  It's like, okay, because we already set the precedent.
[1:40:02.160 --> 1:40:07.320]  They are like steak on the table.
[1:40:07.320 --> 1:40:08.800]  They're like a can of baked beans.
[1:40:08.800 --> 1:40:12.080]  They don't have any rights.
[1:40:12.080 --> 1:40:16.240]  And then you've got this guy that talks like Foghorn Leghorn out there pushing this to
[1:40:16.240 --> 1:40:21.080]  the whole world and he wants us to forget that.
[1:40:21.080 --> 1:40:22.080]  Makes me sick.
[1:40:22.080 --> 1:40:23.080]  We're going to go to break.
[1:40:23.080 --> 1:40:26.480]  We've got specials every hour.
[1:40:26.480 --> 1:40:32.400]  And the special last hour sent into this hour is 55% off all the great X2 iodine that we've
[1:40:32.400 --> 1:40:35.840]  got back in stock by the grace of God and supermell vitality.
[1:40:35.840 --> 1:40:40.400]  Those are the two specials and then they'll go back to 50% off here in the next few hours
[1:40:40.400 --> 1:40:42.600]  and they'll have new things and 55% off.
[1:40:42.600 --> 1:40:48.400]  But everything 50% off, it's a supplement and double Patriot points and free shipping
[1:40:48.400 --> 1:40:50.840]  for a while.
[1:40:50.840 --> 1:40:53.560]  But X2, 98% approval rating, incredible.
[1:40:53.560 --> 1:40:55.720]  Just experience it for yourself, folks, the good halogen.
[1:40:55.720 --> 1:40:56.720]  Find out all about it.
[1:40:56.720 --> 1:40:57.720]  Go read about it.
[1:40:57.720 --> 1:40:59.400]  It's $17.95 right now.
[1:40:59.400 --> 1:41:03.120]  It's an incredible deal, 55% off.
[1:41:03.120 --> 1:41:07.440]  And you fund an operation where we get up here and fight the pedophiles and fight people
[1:41:07.440 --> 1:41:11.360]  openly saying we're going to kill babies after they're born and sell their goodies because
[1:41:11.360 --> 1:41:12.360]  they want their goodies.
[1:41:12.360 --> 1:41:16.560]  Hell, I mean, the pedophiles, I guess, just rape the kids.
[1:41:16.560 --> 1:41:19.560]  These folks want to kill them better than they are and sell their goods.
[1:41:19.560 --> 1:41:25.240]  So you'll sell their innards, sell what the womb God created made and they just think
[1:41:25.240 --> 1:41:26.240]  we're going to take it.
[1:41:26.240 --> 1:41:30.240]  Well, some of us aren't going to take it.
[1:41:30.240 --> 1:41:36.200]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, humanize these babies and give them at least as much value
[1:41:36.200 --> 1:41:43.120]  as the governor, who when he's not wearing a KKK outfits and blackface, totally evil.
[1:41:43.120 --> 1:41:47.520]  These innocent little children suffer little children under me, but if someone threw themselves
[1:41:47.520 --> 1:41:50.600]  a deep as ocean with a giant stone cut around their neck, a millstone would hurt one of
[1:41:50.600 --> 1:41:51.600]  these.
[1:41:51.600 --> 1:41:52.600]  Think about that.
[1:41:52.600 --> 1:41:57.920]  Store-wide free shipping in fullwarstore.com, store-wide free shipping in fullwarstore.com.
[1:41:57.920 --> 1:42:04.000]  50% off all the supplements, bunch of other big deals, but every hour a new special, 55%
[1:42:04.000 --> 1:42:05.520]  off on a particular special.
[1:42:05.520 --> 1:42:09.080]  Oh, the left tells you they care about kids in school shootings.
[1:42:09.080 --> 1:42:10.080]  Turn your guns in.
[1:42:10.080 --> 1:42:13.640]  Oh, they tell you they care about all these things, but they love the Arab Spring murdering
[1:42:13.640 --> 1:42:18.400]  millions and they love killing babies after they're born, they're monsters in national
[1:42:18.400 --> 1:42:24.240]  international studies, nine times more likely to virtue signal and tell you they're given
[1:42:24.240 --> 1:42:30.120]  a charity, but not to six times more likely to steal in every study.
[1:42:30.120 --> 1:42:31.120]  They're scum.
[1:42:31.120 --> 1:42:32.120]  They're filth.
[1:42:32.120 --> 1:42:33.120]  They're liars.
[1:42:33.120 --> 1:42:34.120]  They want the moral authority.
[1:42:34.120 --> 1:42:38.520]  They want you who has a conscience to feel bad when they tell you you're bad because
[1:42:38.520 --> 1:42:40.640]  they have nothing but controlling you.
[1:42:40.640 --> 1:42:45.800]  They have nothing but butchering babies and sucking out their levers or raping them.
[1:42:45.800 --> 1:42:46.800]  It's their religion.
[1:42:46.800 --> 1:42:51.680]  If they can't brain damage them or rape them or get their levers, they'll give them fluoride
[1:42:51.680 --> 1:42:53.960]  and they'll annihilate them with vaccines.
[1:42:53.960 --> 1:42:55.560]  It's all about murdering us.
[1:42:55.560 --> 1:42:57.640]  It's their religion.
[1:42:57.640 --> 1:43:02.520]  There are thousands of ideologies out there, hundreds of different political systems, and
[1:43:02.520 --> 1:43:05.480]  most of them are funded by the globalist.
[1:43:05.480 --> 1:43:08.080]  Infowars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[1:43:08.080 --> 1:43:11.600]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[1:43:11.600 --> 1:43:13.240]  I didn't invent all this.
[1:43:13.240 --> 1:43:18.120]  I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana, and what really works for humanity, and I'm
[1:43:18.120 --> 1:43:19.640]  simply trying to bring it back.
[1:43:19.640 --> 1:43:23.880]  And lo and behold, it's super popular like it's always been.
[1:43:23.880 --> 1:43:27.880]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately because we have the
[1:43:27.880 --> 1:43:31.760]  light in the dark of the night that sends chills up my spine.
[1:43:31.760 --> 1:43:36.280]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and Infowars by buying the great products
[1:43:36.280 --> 1:43:40.720]  at InfowarsStore.com, by spreading the articles, by spreading the videos, and by praying for

[1:44:02.480 --> 1:44:05.400]  So far, it matches any other special we've ever done.

[1:44:40.320 --> 1:44:44.280]  to get great products in the 361 InfowarsStore.com.
[1:44:44.280 --> 1:44:49.280]  Voting with our feet, voting with our dollars, voting with our mouths, voting with our speech,
[1:44:49.280 --> 1:44:54.360]  voting with our action, free shipping store-wide, that's free shipping store-wide, free shipping
[1:44:54.360 --> 1:44:58.360]  store-wide, InfowarsStore.com.
[1:44:58.360 --> 1:45:03.640]  The globalists, the eugenicists, are always talking down to us, they're always trying
[1:45:03.640 --> 1:45:07.280]  to make us feel small, to feel insignificant.
[1:45:07.280 --> 1:45:11.600]  They try to censor, because they fear you and don't want you to have the right to access
[1:45:11.600 --> 1:45:15.200]  information so you can make your own decisions.
[1:45:15.200 --> 1:45:20.040]  They want you to believe you're powerless, but the truth is, it is we the people and
[1:45:20.040 --> 1:45:26.280]  our ideas and our actions, and what we say and what we do, that changes the world.
[1:45:26.280 --> 1:45:32.400]  We are the power structure, we are the inventors, we are the trailblazers, and the globalists
[1:45:32.400 --> 1:45:39.400]  understand that, and they understand that they are basically trying to control and steal
[1:45:39.400 --> 1:45:41.560]  the future from we the people.
[1:45:41.560 --> 1:45:46.920]  Now, to help fund our operation that is undoubtedly the very tip of the spear against these globalists,
[1:45:46.920 --> 1:45:51.160]  I want to encourage listeners and viewers to understand that throughout the second half
[1:45:51.160 --> 1:45:56.200]  of the month of March, we're going to have store-wide free shipping at 50% off of InfowarsStore.com,
[1:45:56.200 --> 1:45:58.800]  something everybody should take advantage of.
[1:45:58.800 --> 1:46:02.600]  Our grandparents, the great grandparents, know that they can food during the fall, so
[1:46:02.600 --> 1:46:07.800]  they have it during the winter, and that's what I'm talking about at InfowarsStore.com.
[1:46:07.800 --> 1:46:13.480]  With Infowars Select, it's the full spectrum of my patriot supply, one of the top most
[1:46:13.480 --> 1:46:18.480]  respected companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below
[1:46:18.480 --> 1:46:23.880]  cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do, but I want to be a market
[1:46:23.880 --> 1:46:27.880]  leader and I want you to have storeable food so it's a total win-win.
[1:46:27.880 --> 1:46:32.880]  We have those incredible sell prices back at InfowarsStore.com, on Infowars Select, storeable
[1:46:32.880 --> 1:46:37.920]  foods, they've got special diet foods, they've got three-month supplies, your supplies, weak
[1:46:37.920 --> 1:46:42.000]  emergency supplies, they've got so many great products there, and you've got a three-year
[1:46:42.000 --> 1:46:43.000]  supply.
[1:46:43.000 --> 1:46:44.960]  If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[1:46:44.960 --> 1:46:47.520]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[1:46:47.520 --> 1:46:52.360]  You're buying war bonds, bringing great products, and together, with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[1:46:52.360 --> 1:47:01.520]  InfowarsStore.com and Infowars Select, high-quality storeable foods, powered by my patriot supply.
[1:47:01.520 --> 1:47:16.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:47:16.560 --> 1:47:21.240]  You know, if you just tuned in, I guarantee you the corporate mainstream media is going
[1:47:21.240 --> 1:47:23.480]  to take what I said last segment and lie about it.
[1:47:23.480 --> 1:47:27.000]  Some people say, well, then you shouldn't say things they can twist.
[1:47:27.000 --> 1:47:28.000]  No.
[1:47:28.000 --> 1:47:31.600]  It's like saying you shouldn't have children because people like Governor Northam out there
[1:47:31.600 --> 1:47:34.560]  that want to kill them, or we should just give up.
[1:47:34.560 --> 1:47:39.840]  I said I wish no harm upon the governor, but I said hypothetically, which I hope never
[1:47:39.840 --> 1:47:45.640]  happens, if two medical doctors grabbed him that were bioethicists and they decided he
[1:47:45.640 --> 1:47:49.120]  wasn't really viable or alive, that's what they do to these already-born babies in the
[1:47:49.120 --> 1:47:53.200]  bioethics game, and then he's sitting there talking while he's chained down to a table
[1:47:53.200 --> 1:47:57.640]  having his organs harvested, starting with his kidneys begging for his life, and they're
[1:47:57.640 --> 1:48:00.800]  saying shut up, bag of guts.
[1:48:00.800 --> 1:48:02.120]  I haven't resuscitated you.
[1:48:02.120 --> 1:48:03.480]  I've decided you're not alive.
[1:48:03.480 --> 1:48:05.760]  I've dehumanized you.
[1:48:05.760 --> 1:48:07.080]  You hear that, and it sounds sick.
[1:48:07.080 --> 1:48:08.920]  It sounds like silence of the lambs.
[1:48:08.920 --> 1:48:09.920]  It sounds horrible.
[1:48:09.920 --> 1:48:16.640]  It sounds indefensible because it is, just like killing already-born babies are.
[1:48:16.640 --> 1:48:22.480]  And I just showed you Beto O'Rourke endorsing it because they've been caught in Texas,
[1:48:22.480 --> 1:48:27.120]  in California, and New York, and Virginia keeping babies alive.
[1:48:27.120 --> 1:48:32.640]  And the nurses will follow a lot of orders, folks, but this whole thing that we're going
[1:48:32.640 --> 1:48:37.480]  to decide, the mother's not sure if she wants to keep the baby, and then they're getting
[1:48:37.480 --> 1:48:40.000]  them set up to have their organs harvested, and the nurses know that.
[1:48:40.000 --> 1:48:44.480]  We've had nurses on, and it's been in the news that when they give the babies the shots
[1:48:44.480 --> 1:48:49.920]  that are in the Neo-Nik-U area for the preemies, that they get respirators ready because they're
[1:48:49.920 --> 1:48:54.120]  ordered to give them shots, even though until five years ago you didn't give premature
[1:48:54.120 --> 1:48:55.120]  kids shots.
[1:48:55.120 --> 1:48:56.120]  It can kill them.
[1:48:56.120 --> 1:48:59.240]  And now up to half of them start dying, and they got to put them on respirators and then
[1:48:59.240 --> 1:49:06.000]  keep them alive, and then the doctors walk in and go, hold on now.
[1:49:06.000 --> 1:49:08.920]  It's all eugenics getting rid of the infirm.
[1:49:08.920 --> 1:49:14.680]  They're practicing it in the hospitals to get nurses used to killing babies with vaccines,
[1:49:14.680 --> 1:49:18.600]  so that when they harvest organs, the nurses don't understand what's happening.
[1:49:18.600 --> 1:49:23.400]  It's all about maneuvering you by successive approximation to see what you'll do.
[1:49:23.400 --> 1:49:26.680]  How many things have I told you turned out to be going on?
[1:49:26.680 --> 1:49:30.840]  I've been telling you 20-plus years they're taking babies' organs.
[1:49:30.840 --> 1:49:32.640]  Now it's all over the news.
[1:49:32.640 --> 1:49:36.520]  That's why Northam is on television trying to mainline it.
[1:49:36.520 --> 1:49:40.840]  Squat Beto's doing that.
[1:49:40.840 --> 1:49:48.080]  Peter O'Rourke, beyond Peter, wants to kill kids, and it's hiding in plain view, just
[1:49:48.080 --> 1:49:53.240]  like I'm on Joe Rogan's podcast, and Joe's really smart and well-revealed.
[1:49:53.240 --> 1:50:00.720]  He always goes kind of with the official story at first, and I'm saying, and here and in
[1:50:00.720 --> 1:50:07.240]  the black areas of Alabama, and in West Virginia, and Kentucky with poor whites, and with Native
[1:50:07.240 --> 1:50:16.400]  Americans in Arizona, and in New Mexico, and in Peru, our government for 40-plus years
[1:50:16.400 --> 1:50:20.640]  injected people with live syphilis, so they'd spread it and kill hundreds of thousands.
[1:50:20.640 --> 1:50:21.640]  That's a criminal element.
[1:50:21.640 --> 1:50:25.240]  And Joe goes, wait a minute, we knew they had it and let them spread it.
[1:50:25.240 --> 1:50:26.240]  No.
[1:50:26.240 --> 1:50:31.600]  And Peter O'Rourke engineered it, NBC had to admit.
[1:50:31.600 --> 1:50:38.920]  That's because I actually read the Tuskegee reports that came out in Congress in the mid-80s
[1:50:38.920 --> 1:50:41.520]  versus what news would say.
[1:50:41.520 --> 1:50:42.520]  You understand?
[1:50:42.520 --> 1:50:45.760]  So when you go to the CDC, you get the whitewash, but we have a congressional record.
[1:50:45.760 --> 1:50:48.840]  I'm going to say it again, but notice what they did.
[1:50:48.840 --> 1:50:51.360]  If you understand this, you understand everything.
[1:50:51.360 --> 1:50:54.760]  You see, with the left, there's an elitism that they're healthy, they're whatever, they'll
[1:50:54.760 --> 1:50:58.200]  decide to kill grandma, they'll decide to kill a baby, they're in charge.
[1:50:58.200 --> 1:51:00.200]  And it's the same thing.
[1:51:00.200 --> 1:51:05.560]  Well, when it came out, criminal elements of the CDC had been injecting people from Pakistan
[1:51:05.560 --> 1:51:13.360]  to Peru to the U.S. with live syphilis, and by the way, polio was also part of another
[1:51:13.360 --> 1:51:14.360]  program.
[1:51:14.360 --> 1:51:15.360]  What are we going to do?
[1:51:15.360 --> 1:51:19.000]  They go, contain it, say it was rural blacks that'll feed into the whole guilt thing and
[1:51:19.000 --> 1:51:22.360]  that whites are racist, don't want to know the full picture of the eugenics, and just
[1:51:22.360 --> 1:51:25.080]  isolated it to Alabama, and it worked perfectly.
[1:51:25.080 --> 1:51:30.400]  They isolated it just to Alabama, which was terrible and wrong, tens of thousands of blacks
[1:51:30.400 --> 1:51:35.280]  given syphilis, hundreds of thousands got it, horrible long excruciating deaths.
[1:51:35.280 --> 1:51:42.920]  Syphilis is microscopic worms that literally eat your brain and other organs, and there's
[1:51:42.920 --> 1:51:43.920]  no cure.
[1:51:43.920 --> 1:51:44.920]  Still, there's treatments.
[1:51:44.920 --> 1:51:50.200]  You have to understand, ladies and gentlemen, these people mean business, and why they're
[1:51:50.200 --> 1:51:55.760]  obsessed with syphilis, we're not sure, but it may be a carrier for a binary weapon.
[1:51:55.760 --> 1:51:58.840]  Because it was German scientists, they brought over to the world war two at Plum Island,
[1:51:58.840 --> 1:52:05.360]  off the shore of New York, this is all declassified, who created Lyme's disease, a weaponized syphilis,
[1:52:05.360 --> 1:52:12.920]  Lyme's disease is syphilis, carried in the tit, and I have a family member who was rock-climbing,
[1:52:12.920 --> 1:52:20.160]  super healthy at 50 something, got Lyme's disease on a hunting trip in East Texas and
[1:52:20.160 --> 1:52:22.000]  had never recovered.
[1:52:22.000 --> 1:52:27.360]  And I have another friend who, it ain't part of his spine, you name it, from a tick.
[1:52:27.360 --> 1:52:33.160]  Now, what I'm telling you is, folks, is that they're hitting us with syphilis, and so,
[1:52:33.160 --> 1:52:35.720]  but oh, just don't worry, it's just those black people.
[1:52:35.720 --> 1:52:36.720]  Yeah, right.
[1:52:36.720 --> 1:52:41.360]  That's why we all got to know we're in this together when they push this racism crap and
[1:52:41.360 --> 1:52:42.360]  this divide and conquer.
[1:52:42.360 --> 1:52:46.480]  Doesn't mean we don't expose racist blacks or Hispanics or whites or anybody that are
[1:52:46.480 --> 1:52:47.480]  being like that.
[1:52:47.480 --> 1:52:49.520]  The business we buy and also being guilt-ridden about it.
[1:52:49.520 --> 1:52:54.200]  We point out the real, globalist, racist social engineer program is what's attacking
[1:52:54.200 --> 1:52:59.120]  us and what is out of control and what has to be dealt with.
[1:52:59.120 --> 1:53:00.360]  So don't believe me.
[1:53:00.360 --> 1:53:01.920]  Look up Tuskegee.
[1:53:01.920 --> 1:53:05.400]  Look up that they gave it to people on purpose.
[1:53:05.400 --> 1:53:07.960]  Look up that the atomic soldiers.
[1:53:07.960 --> 1:53:09.520]  Look it up and grow up.
[1:53:09.520 --> 1:53:17.520]  Now, I don't mean our general audience, but new listeners.
[1:53:17.520 --> 1:53:21.520]  The U.N. has an insatiable appetite for children.
[1:53:21.520 --> 1:53:23.600]  You think I just obsessed on children, children, children?
[1:53:23.600 --> 1:53:27.080]  When you pull back and you look at this new World Order, man, it's got one thing on its
[1:53:27.080 --> 1:53:30.640]  mind and it's killing, raping, diseaseing, and hurting children.
[1:53:30.640 --> 1:53:33.560]  Well, what the hell do you think the devil wants to do?
[1:53:33.560 --> 1:53:37.480]  What do all the ancient legends tell us about the elites?
[1:53:37.480 --> 1:53:38.480]  They're not the elites.
[1:53:38.480 --> 1:53:39.480]  They are demons.
[1:53:39.480 --> 1:53:43.640]  Whether you believe in the devil and God or demons or angels, it doesn't matter.
[1:53:43.640 --> 1:53:45.440]  They believe in you.
[1:53:45.440 --> 1:53:52.280]  And they've got a hunger that's unquenchable and they're not going to live in peace with
[1:53:52.280 --> 1:53:57.960]  us until we deal with them.
[1:53:57.960 --> 1:54:02.160]  So again, I illustrate the absurdity of killing already-born babies with what if somebody,
[1:54:02.160 --> 1:54:07.960]  God forbid, nobody should do this, grab the God-like governor and told him while he's
[1:54:07.960 --> 1:54:13.840]  chained down, you're not alive because I'm a bioethics doctor like you.
[1:54:13.840 --> 1:54:17.080]  The state shouldn't be involved in this, I say you're not alive and I'm going to take
[1:54:17.080 --> 1:54:20.320]  power drills to your kneecaps right now and then I'm going to cut your guts out right
[1:54:20.320 --> 1:54:21.320]  in front of you.
[1:54:21.320 --> 1:54:22.320]  No, please don't do it.
[1:54:22.320 --> 1:54:23.320]  God, why are you doing this?
[1:54:23.320 --> 1:54:24.320]  I'm a human being.
[1:54:24.320 --> 1:54:25.320]  This is murder.
[1:54:25.320 --> 1:54:26.320]  No, it's not.
[1:54:26.320 --> 1:54:27.320]  I said you're not alive.
[1:54:27.320 --> 1:54:28.320]  Scumbag.
[1:54:28.320 --> 1:54:30.320]  So I'm not killing anybody.
[1:54:30.320 --> 1:54:33.000]  Now, see, I'd never do that.
[1:54:33.000 --> 1:54:34.400]  That sounds outrageous though, doesn't it?
[1:54:34.400 --> 1:54:40.440]  As the illustration of what he's saying on TV to do to babies, what Beto O'Rourke is saying,
[1:54:40.440 --> 1:54:43.520]  these people are monsters.
[1:54:43.520 --> 1:54:45.440]  They're not clear and present danger.
[1:54:45.440 --> 1:54:48.800]  They're acting attacks on our children.
[1:54:48.800 --> 1:54:53.840]  They're a psycho cult pushing what they can get away with on us.
[1:54:53.840 --> 1:55:00.080]  All those undercover videos, the pro-lifers shot of people drinking $200 bottle of wine
[1:55:00.080 --> 1:55:04.000]  talking about how they're making millions a year and going, I'm looking at a yellow
[1:55:04.000 --> 1:55:11.680]  Lamborghini and every time there's a video, they're eating some super fancy restaurant,
[1:55:11.680 --> 1:55:13.800]  they got huge diamond rings on their fingers.
[1:55:13.800 --> 1:55:18.160]  It's always rich women and they're just going, God, I don't know, we're making so much money
[1:55:18.160 --> 1:55:19.720]  off these baby parts.
[1:55:19.720 --> 1:55:23.000]  That was just a way to keep them alive longer.
[1:55:23.000 --> 1:55:24.360]  Well, we're getting a problem.
[1:55:24.360 --> 1:55:27.200]  There's a lot of lawsuits and stuff that are on our ass about it, but let me tell you,
[1:55:27.200 --> 1:55:28.440]  we're talking billions here.
[1:55:28.440 --> 1:55:32.440]  But we're working on some bioethics where we can keep little buggers alive, gut their
[1:55:32.440 --> 1:55:33.440]  asses.
[1:55:33.440 --> 1:55:36.600]  And look, I said I'd go to your calls and I haven't gone to you, but I get on this
[1:55:36.600 --> 1:55:43.480]  subject folks and you've got to understand what we're dealing with.
[1:55:43.480 --> 1:55:48.160]  You've got to understand the evil that we've allowed to grow and get out of control in
[1:55:48.160 --> 1:55:50.120]  this country.
[1:55:50.120 --> 1:55:54.440]  And they want your speech and they want your guns and they want your property because they
[1:55:54.440 --> 1:55:57.000]  want to make you destitute where they run your life.
[1:55:57.000 --> 1:56:02.720]  So I'll tell you this, take a cut and pay, do whatever you got to do, but if you can
[1:56:02.720 --> 1:56:07.640]  do it, you've got children, get to the country and find good people and find a good church
[1:56:07.640 --> 1:56:15.040]  and get together and get self-sufficient because society is going to collapse and this is revelation.
[1:56:15.040 --> 1:56:18.280]  I don't know if it's 10 years, 20 years down the road, but it's all real.
[1:56:18.280 --> 1:56:19.560]  You're going to have world government.
[1:56:19.560 --> 1:56:23.360]  You're going to have over a third of the world's population killed, microchips in the brains,
[1:56:23.360 --> 1:56:24.920]  Satan on the planet.
[1:56:24.920 --> 1:56:25.920]  It's all going to happen.
[1:56:25.920 --> 1:56:26.920]  It's all true.
[1:56:26.920 --> 1:56:27.920]  It's all happening.
[1:56:27.920 --> 1:56:28.920]  It's all real.
[1:56:28.920 --> 1:56:31.480]  They're openly saying they're killing babies after they're born on television.
[1:56:31.480 --> 1:56:35.440]  They're editing humanoids, they're crossing humans with animals and they're doing everything.
[1:56:35.440 --> 1:56:36.440]  It's all here.
[1:56:36.440 --> 1:56:37.440]  It's happening.
[1:56:37.440 --> 1:56:38.440]  It's true.
[1:56:38.440 --> 1:56:40.920]  God warned us and thinks that if we were given a warning, God gives us free will, but
[1:56:40.920 --> 1:56:43.840]  he loves his children.
[1:56:43.840 --> 1:56:45.240]  And so God gave us a cheat sheet.
[1:56:45.240 --> 1:56:48.280]  God said, I'm going to put you in the game because you deserve free will and I want to
[1:56:48.280 --> 1:56:52.520]  be with you forever, but I want free will entities of their own universe.
[1:56:52.520 --> 1:56:56.160]  God creates the new universe, a new consciousness, a new free will is a new universe.
[1:56:56.160 --> 1:57:01.000]  The only thing God can do that is outside of God is to turn you loose with your own free
[1:57:01.000 --> 1:57:07.320]  will and create a whole new image of him that has free will and then put you into a combat
[1:57:07.320 --> 1:57:12.680]  zone with lower dimensional demons that absolutely hate your ass because you're superior.
[1:57:12.680 --> 1:57:19.360]  God dumps his children into a prison planet war zone to see if you can handle it and deal
[1:57:19.360 --> 1:57:22.360]  with it to go to the next level.
[1:57:22.360 --> 1:57:23.360]  Think about that.
[1:57:23.360 --> 1:57:24.360]  Think God likes that.
[1:57:24.360 --> 1:57:25.360]  People say God's a status.
[1:57:25.360 --> 1:57:28.080]  No, God gave birth to free will.
[1:57:28.080 --> 1:57:33.520]  God gave birth to you and your spirit that was put in your mother and that earth suit
[1:57:33.520 --> 1:57:35.800]  of all your ancestors to hold and love that child.
[1:57:35.800 --> 1:57:40.120]  And now they're taking that sacred creature that's in the image of God and destroying
[1:57:40.120 --> 1:57:44.000]  it because they hate it because it's so superior.
[1:57:44.000 --> 1:57:45.240]  We'll be right back with your phone call.
[1:57:45.240 --> 1:57:46.240]  Stay with us.
[1:57:46.240 --> 1:57:51.800]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or
[1:57:51.800 --> 1:57:56.040]  to go for a run or go to the park or heck even take your dog for a walk.
[1:57:56.040 --> 1:58:01.120]  I know I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every
[1:58:01.120 --> 1:58:02.120]  day.
[1:58:02.120 --> 1:58:07.280]  But thanks to SupermailVitality at InfowarsStore.com I still have that energy.
[1:58:07.280 --> 1:58:11.480]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against
[1:58:11.480 --> 1:58:15.680]  the chemicals and the food and water to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with
[1:58:15.680 --> 1:58:20.640]  the screen time and the extended hours to still have the stamina and endurance, energy
[1:58:20.640 --> 1:58:27.880]  and drive to get to the gym, get to the park and get exercise that you need for your health.
[1:58:27.880 --> 1:58:31.880]  So go to InfowarsStore.com and get SupermailVitality before it's gone.
[1:58:31.880 --> 1:58:35.560]  This is actually our last run of SupermailVitality.
[1:58:35.560 --> 1:58:40.840]  So I want you to experience SupermailVitality before it's too late.
[1:58:40.840 --> 1:58:52.000]  It's simple, if you want to beat the globalist, if you want to take on the new world order,
[1:58:52.000 --> 1:58:55.000]  I'm not doing Bitcoin, pump and dumps with Jack Dorsey.
[1:58:55.000 --> 1:58:57.480]  I'm not sitting here selling you cancer cures.
[1:58:57.480 --> 1:59:01.120]  I'm not sitting here, you know, selling you late term abortion and all the great it is.
[1:59:01.120 --> 1:59:04.080]  I just go out and say, what is the top heart pill?
[1:59:04.080 --> 1:59:08.320]  What is the top tumor is the best seller because it's anti-inflammatory and what's the best
[1:59:08.320 --> 1:59:09.320]  lab in the country?
[1:59:09.320 --> 1:59:10.320]  Okay, they're the highest rated.
[1:59:10.320 --> 1:59:11.320]  I'm like, you're only 50% curcuminoid?
[1:59:11.320 --> 1:59:15.880]  Well, yeah, they only put $5 product and bottle, but that's still incredible, sir.
[1:59:15.880 --> 1:59:19.280]  I'm like, what's the highest you could do a month later?
[1:59:19.280 --> 1:59:20.280]  90, 95%.
[1:59:20.280 --> 1:59:21.280]  No one's ever done that.
[1:59:21.280 --> 1:59:24.080]  I said, how much does that cost for a bottle that costs $10?
[1:59:24.080 --> 1:59:25.520]  No one's ever done that, sir.
[1:59:25.520 --> 1:59:27.800]  The average competitor is 3% to 5%.
[1:59:27.800 --> 1:59:28.800]  The top brand is 50%.
[1:59:28.800 --> 1:59:30.800]  I'm like, we're going to have 95% curcuminoid.
[1:59:30.800 --> 1:59:34.680]  I mean, you understand, like, that's like our information is explosive.
[1:59:34.680 --> 1:59:35.680]  Our fish oil.
[1:59:35.680 --> 1:59:37.800]  I go out and I get the cleanest, the best.
[1:59:37.800 --> 1:59:38.920]  My children take it.
[1:59:38.920 --> 1:59:43.240]  You think I'm going to give you fish oil that didn't the very damn best on my soul?
[1:59:43.240 --> 1:59:46.400]  You think I'm going to screw somebody over like one of these devil worshipers?
[1:59:46.400 --> 1:59:51.440]  Never in foreshore.com.
[1:59:51.440 --> 2:00:08.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:00:08.440 --> 2:00:14.960]  All right.
[2:00:14.960 --> 2:00:16.960]  They have really loaded the schedule today.
[2:00:16.960 --> 2:00:20.360]  I want Tom Pappert to come on and host with us for hours and George Norris coming up in
[2:00:20.360 --> 2:00:23.080]  30 minutes and I got loaded phone lines.
[2:00:23.080 --> 2:00:24.080]  I want to get Tom Pappert.
[2:00:24.080 --> 2:00:25.080]  He's a great patriot.
[2:00:25.080 --> 2:00:32.520]  Of course, he heads up a real, real GE Trump, God Emperor Trump and on Facebook.com, God
[2:00:32.520 --> 2:00:33.720]  Emperor Trump official.
[2:00:33.720 --> 2:00:36.400]  He also manages one of the great TV stations we're on.
[2:00:36.400 --> 2:00:39.640]  Now, you've been hearing me rant here and I'm out of control, you know, when I start
[2:00:39.640 --> 2:00:43.080]  playing clips of governors saying we kill babies after they're born, I know what's behind
[2:00:43.080 --> 2:00:44.080]  it.
[2:00:44.080 --> 2:00:45.080]  I see beat over work defending it.
[2:00:45.080 --> 2:00:49.720]  And then I know the whole game plan behind it because my dad worked in hospital and dental
[2:00:49.720 --> 2:00:54.600]  office management for a long time and I knew a lot of people involved in it, not just him.
[2:00:54.600 --> 2:00:56.760]  And they all told me about this stuff 30 years ago.
[2:00:56.760 --> 2:00:58.280]  Now, it's all mainline.
[2:00:58.280 --> 2:01:03.560]  It actually, I mean, I'll be honest, it actually makes me feel extremely vicious, Tom.
[2:01:03.560 --> 2:01:04.720]  How do you deal with this?
[2:01:04.720 --> 2:01:09.780]  It's implanting it in our face that we're going to kill your babies after they're born.
[2:01:09.780 --> 2:01:13.600]  It is absolutely disgusting and frankly, Alex, I deal with it the same way you do.
[2:01:13.600 --> 2:01:14.600]  I get angry.
[2:01:14.600 --> 2:01:15.600]  I get visceral.
[2:01:15.600 --> 2:01:20.560]  I get red vision where I can't even see your think straight because it's disgusting.
[2:01:20.560 --> 2:01:24.360]  They are ruining children, murdering them, selling them for parts.
[2:01:24.360 --> 2:01:29.600]  And if you're lucky enough to make it out of the womb, you're going to have a trans drag
[2:01:29.600 --> 2:01:34.600]  queen person shoving their male genitalia in your child's face.
[2:01:34.600 --> 2:01:39.960]  It is honestly the biggest affront to traditional values to America is what they're doing to
[2:01:39.960 --> 2:01:40.960]  children in this country.
[2:01:40.960 --> 2:01:41.960]  And like you, I just get angry.
[2:01:41.960 --> 2:01:46.520]  It's literally a gauntlet, right?
[2:01:46.520 --> 2:01:47.520]  You cannot escape it.
[2:01:47.520 --> 2:01:50.200]  I mean, and if you're lucky enough, again, if you make it out of the womb, you get to
[2:01:50.200 --> 2:01:54.280]  six years old or now you've got Democrat presidential candidates.
[2:01:54.280 --> 2:01:59.200]  They say two years old, we need to send the kids to government schools so they can be
[2:01:59.200 --> 2:02:02.720]  indoctrinated to support that video that was just playing right there.
[2:02:02.720 --> 2:02:05.680]  Put a drag queen sing to a child.
[2:02:05.680 --> 2:02:07.040]  What's wrong with that?
[2:02:07.040 --> 2:02:08.040]  Look at it.
[2:02:08.040 --> 2:02:10.280]  Put its butt up in the kid's face.
[2:02:10.280 --> 2:02:12.760]  How do people see this and not just see right?
[2:02:12.760 --> 2:02:17.120]  And a lot of them are convicted child rapists, literally they're grooming children for all
[2:02:17.120 --> 2:02:18.120]  this.
[2:02:18.120 --> 2:02:19.120]  Right.
[2:02:19.120 --> 2:02:20.440]  That was in your home state of Texas.
[2:02:20.440 --> 2:02:25.200]  Granted, it was Houston and not Austin, I think, but yeah, a child predator convicted
[2:02:25.200 --> 2:02:28.760]  of indecent acts with an eight year old boy.
[2:02:28.760 --> 2:02:33.360]  Then we're going to put that guy in a dress and put him in a public library so he can
[2:02:33.360 --> 2:02:35.240]  go read the children.
[2:02:35.240 --> 2:02:37.000]  And nobody can explain this.
[2:02:37.000 --> 2:02:39.360]  Nobody can say why we need to have this stuff.
[2:02:39.360 --> 2:02:44.680]  Nobody has been able to say, well, you see, drag queens are a protected pump.
[2:02:44.680 --> 2:02:49.640]  No, what it is is it's predator men dressed up like women to get close to your kids and
[2:02:49.640 --> 2:02:52.640]  say, touch me, sit in my lap, shake your butt.
[2:02:52.640 --> 2:02:55.920]  Imagine if a man walked up in the park for a sand of your daughter's son, shake your
[2:02:55.920 --> 2:02:57.760]  butt, touch my beard.
[2:02:57.760 --> 2:03:00.120]  You know, you know what would happen?
[2:03:00.120 --> 2:03:02.000]  Oh, it would be the end of the world.
[2:03:02.000 --> 2:03:07.420]  I mean, just imagine if a testosterone filled dad brought his 12 year old boy to a Hooters.
[2:03:07.420 --> 2:03:08.640]  That would be terrible.
[2:03:08.640 --> 2:03:10.280]  You can't have anything normal.
[2:03:10.280 --> 2:03:15.840]  But again, you get these weird mentally ill men and dresses and all of a sudden, oh, it's
[2:03:15.840 --> 2:03:16.840]  so cool.
[2:03:16.840 --> 2:03:17.840]  Oh, it's so neat.
[2:03:17.840 --> 2:03:18.840]  Oh, absolutely.
[2:03:18.840 --> 2:03:19.840]  They say it's wrong.
[2:03:19.840 --> 2:03:23.120]  If your, you know, when your son's 16 or whatever, he's a little shy to like accidentally
[2:03:23.120 --> 2:03:26.520]  a playboy gets dropped by their room or you encourage him to, you know, have your buddy
[2:03:26.520 --> 2:03:28.240]  at work go out with his daughter or whatever.
[2:03:28.240 --> 2:03:30.280]  I mean, that's what people used to do.
[2:03:30.280 --> 2:03:31.280]  That's considered racy.
[2:03:31.280 --> 2:03:33.240]  You know, in bed because that's toxic masculinity.
[2:03:33.240 --> 2:03:37.640]  No, let's instead have the kids that are all shy only be when they're three years old,
[2:03:37.640 --> 2:03:41.080]  experience a big fat convicted child rapist shake their ass in their face.
[2:03:41.080 --> 2:03:42.080]  Right.
[2:03:42.080 --> 2:03:47.000]  And my only hope from all this, my only honest to God hope is maybe these kids will rebel.
[2:03:47.000 --> 2:03:52.800]  Maybe they're going to see this social justice drag queen abortion promiscuity insanity being
[2:03:52.800 --> 2:03:54.280]  shoved down their throats.
[2:03:54.280 --> 2:03:59.600]  And maybe that's why Gen Z is supposedly the most conservative generation since World War
[2:03:59.600 --> 2:04:02.560]  II, because this is what they're being exposed to.
[2:04:02.560 --> 2:04:03.960]  It's a little bit like in the nineties.
[2:04:03.960 --> 2:04:08.120]  It's like, well, I guess it's the exact opposite, but it's almost the same when the hardcore
[2:04:08.120 --> 2:04:11.920]  Christians were condemning comic books and video games and anything fun.
[2:04:11.920 --> 2:04:15.840]  And so that made kids want comic books and video games and anything fun.
[2:04:15.840 --> 2:04:20.200]  Maybe that's what's going to happen because from the age of two years old on up to 20,
[2:04:20.200 --> 2:04:22.800]  they're going to be told drag queens are good.
[2:04:22.800 --> 2:04:24.360]  Women is good.
[2:04:24.360 --> 2:04:25.360]  Sex with anybody is good.
[2:04:25.360 --> 2:04:26.360]  You're absolutely right.
[2:04:26.360 --> 2:04:29.000]  I want to get into any other, because you always got a lot of big subjects and take
[2:04:29.000 --> 2:04:30.000]  calls.
[2:04:30.000 --> 2:04:33.320]  We come back with Mr. Pappard and I want to invite you to join us for the full hour during
[2:04:33.320 --> 2:04:39.920]  the 50 hour transmission that we're smack dab in the first launch phase of here, baby.

[2:04:58.520 --> 2:05:00.680]  And it's not like we're selling stuff you don't need.
[2:05:00.680 --> 2:05:06.760]  You don't want the air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on
[2:05:06.760 --> 2:05:09.640]  par with a major city.
[2:05:09.640 --> 2:05:13.060]  There's some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[2:05:13.060 --> 2:05:14.800]  How can I solve that problem?
[2:05:14.800 --> 2:05:19.640]  So we have air filters at info wars store.com the Alexa pure breeze, which is right now
[2:05:19.640 --> 2:05:28.520]  $50 off the Alexa pure breeze groundbreaking iron cluster air filter technology.
[2:05:28.520 --> 2:05:31.440]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[2:05:31.440 --> 2:05:34.960]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[2:05:34.960 --> 2:05:39.200]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five star reviews for yourself.
[2:05:39.200 --> 2:05:41.160]  I've got two in my home.
[2:05:41.160 --> 2:05:46.320]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa pure breeze in your
[2:05:46.320 --> 2:05:52.000]  warehouse, don't live in a polluted major city in your home.
[2:05:52.000 --> 2:05:53.000]  Have clean air.
[2:05:53.000 --> 2:06:19.520]  Go to info wars store.com.
[2:06:19.520 --> 2:06:26.080]  This is coast to coast a year with your host George Norrie and now from the city of angels,
[2:06:26.080 --> 2:06:27.080]  George Norrie.
[2:06:27.080 --> 2:06:32.520]  George Norrie is coming up the bottom of the hour talking about the attack on free speech
[2:06:32.520 --> 2:06:33.520]  and how to fight back.
[2:06:33.520 --> 2:06:37.800]  Now they're banning books off Amazon and New Zealand's ban, Jordan Peterson, his book,
[2:06:37.800 --> 2:06:42.080]  nothing to do with shootings or anything.
[2:06:42.080 --> 2:06:44.280]  It's just, there's no bottom to it.
[2:06:44.280 --> 2:06:50.840]  They have major Democrat platforms, you know, calling for, uh, now Ben Shapiro to be taken
[2:06:50.840 --> 2:06:51.840]  off the air.
[2:06:51.840 --> 2:06:54.680]  Boy, where was Ben defending me when I was getting censored?
[2:06:54.680 --> 2:06:56.480]  Well, I'll, I'll still defend him.
[2:06:56.480 --> 2:06:58.120]  It's crazy.
[2:06:58.120 --> 2:07:00.120]  It's absolutely insane.
[2:07:00.120 --> 2:07:02.360]  Mr. Pappert is our guest.
[2:07:02.360 --> 2:07:05.200]  Tom, tell folks about the great TV station that you had up.
[2:07:05.200 --> 2:07:06.880]  People can tune into that.
[2:07:06.880 --> 2:07:12.440]  So we're KCTU TV five, got the big five right behind me here on set in Wichita, Kansas.
[2:07:12.440 --> 2:07:17.120]  And if you're watching in Wichita or the surrounding area, put a paper clip, put a cheap antenna
[2:07:17.120 --> 2:07:24.600]  on the back of your TV and nine out of 10 odds, you will get info wars on channel 5.4.
[2:07:24.600 --> 2:07:27.120]  And it's been honestly one of our most successful stations.
[2:07:27.120 --> 2:07:31.880]  We just got done moving Alex to a bigger studio, bigger facilities, doing all kinds of construction
[2:07:31.880 --> 2:07:33.600]  work to get it up to par.
[2:07:33.600 --> 2:07:38.080]  And as we did that, we found ourselves going, uh-oh, we need a bunch of extra help.
[2:07:38.080 --> 2:07:39.980]  We didn't really intend on needing.
[2:07:39.980 --> 2:07:43.800]  We put out a Facebook post saying, Hey, if you're an info warrior, we need you, please
[2:07:43.800 --> 2:07:46.120]  come in, give us a call, say what you can do.
[2:07:46.120 --> 2:07:47.720]  We can use all the help in the world.
[2:07:47.720 --> 2:07:52.520]  We had a massive outpouring and one guy in particular Brandon did a tremendous job is
[2:07:52.520 --> 2:07:57.680]  basically the reason why we got up on the air as quick as we did info wars is huge.
[2:07:57.680 --> 2:07:59.320]  And I'm glad we get to be a part of it.
[2:07:59.320 --> 2:08:03.440]  And let's be clear, everywhere we're on within a year, it creates a fight on TV and radio
[2:08:03.440 --> 2:08:07.440]  for bigger stations to want to get the show because we always become number one or close
[2:08:07.440 --> 2:08:08.440]  to it.
[2:08:08.440 --> 2:08:11.880]  A lot of times ESPN comes in and buys out the station and then we get taken off and
[2:08:11.880 --> 2:08:13.200]  a year later, the contract goes away.
[2:08:13.200 --> 2:08:14.200]  We get back on.
[2:08:14.200 --> 2:08:17.400]  Now you won't get into the whole thing behind the scenes, a lot of great stations, but there's
[2:08:17.400 --> 2:08:20.440]  been a fight over who gets the show because the ratings just exploded.
[2:08:20.440 --> 2:08:23.000]  What, how many months did it take for the ratings to explode?
[2:08:23.000 --> 2:08:25.000]  Oh, I mean, it was overnight.
[2:08:25.000 --> 2:08:29.000]  As soon as people figured out what was going on, I mean, a lot of people watch, of course,
[2:08:29.000 --> 2:08:34.000]  they still have the app on their phone or they go to the info wars.com slash show.
[2:08:34.000 --> 2:08:38.400]  When you find out it can be as easy as pressing a button and going on TV, not a day goes
[2:08:38.400 --> 2:08:39.400]  by.
[2:08:39.400 --> 2:08:43.040]  We don't get a phone call saying, I just found you guys, I found out you have Alex Jones,
[2:08:43.040 --> 2:08:46.160]  I found out you have RT, I found out you have Newsnet.
[2:08:46.160 --> 2:08:47.160]  Thank you so much.
[2:08:47.160 --> 2:08:49.960]  I'm your new biggest fan and it has been absolutely tremendous.
[2:08:49.960 --> 2:08:54.080]  I mean, people cannot get enough of it and it's so exciting when you're expanding programming
[2:08:54.080 --> 2:08:58.880]  and doing stuff like what's going on right now with this 50 hour live broadcast to protect
[2:08:58.880 --> 2:09:03.000]  the first amendment and people just love it and I'm glad that we can be part of the info
[2:09:03.000 --> 2:09:04.000]  war.
[2:09:04.000 --> 2:09:05.000]  That's right.
[2:09:05.000 --> 2:09:06.000]  There's no reviews yet for it.
[2:09:06.000 --> 2:09:09.280]  I had a few months ago with you, but it's at info wars.com.
[2:09:09.280 --> 2:09:11.560]  We bought the best selling antenna.
[2:09:11.560 --> 2:09:17.720]  We sell it for what is it $5 less than Amazon does info wars, HD digital TV antenna.
[2:09:17.720 --> 2:09:21.640]  Remember when TV didn't watch you, you watch television and I've forgotten and I didn't
[2:09:21.640 --> 2:09:25.960]  know how great digital TV was, so I'm not a big TV person until I bought a condo that's
[2:09:25.960 --> 2:09:27.440]  next to where my parents house.
[2:09:27.440 --> 2:09:30.520]  So my kids will have a place, you know, in college or whatever, you know, down the road.
[2:09:30.520 --> 2:09:33.800]  So when I stay by my parents who are in middle of town, I can stay at the condo that's right
[2:09:33.800 --> 2:09:34.800]  next door.
[2:09:34.800 --> 2:09:39.440]  I sit right on top of them and I was going to put cable in, but I thought, well, I never
[2:09:39.440 --> 2:09:41.440]  really, you know, I'm there very much.
[2:09:41.440 --> 2:09:47.840]  And then my dad hooked up a digital antenna that was, you know, like 30, 40 bucks.
[2:09:47.840 --> 2:09:53.640]  And I mean, look, you're talking here in Austin, like 100 plus digital channels.
[2:09:53.640 --> 2:09:59.200]  And then they'll have four or five sub channels of every old cool TV show, old movies.
[2:09:59.200 --> 2:10:01.200]  It's like way better than cable.
[2:10:01.200 --> 2:10:05.760]  It's just insane and like 15 channels of Mexican TV with all those beautiful women.
[2:10:05.760 --> 2:10:06.760]  I'll be honest.
[2:10:06.760 --> 2:10:07.760]  That's what I like to watch.
[2:10:07.760 --> 2:10:08.760]  It's just so hilarious.
[2:10:08.760 --> 2:10:10.880]  I've even picked up some Spanish doing it.
[2:10:10.880 --> 2:10:13.040]  And plus I do like Mexican music.
[2:10:13.040 --> 2:10:17.880]  The point is, is that it's there's so many channels and it's not watching you.
[2:10:17.880 --> 2:10:19.040]  It's not tracking you.
[2:10:19.040 --> 2:10:23.120]  So we do sell the antennas at the lowest price you'll find them for store.com.
[2:10:23.120 --> 2:10:24.280]  I think that is phenomenal.
[2:10:24.280 --> 2:10:28.080]  You know, it has exploded in this country as people are sick of ESPN, they're sick of
[2:10:28.080 --> 2:10:31.000]  Fox News, they're sick of the cable news networks.
[2:10:31.000 --> 2:10:32.080]  They're sick of the kneeling.
[2:10:32.080 --> 2:10:36.240]  They're sick of being gouged to $300 a month just to watch TV.
[2:10:36.240 --> 2:10:37.240]  They find out.
[2:10:37.240 --> 2:10:41.600]  Yeah, you can plug in an antenna and even in a much smaller city like Wichita, Kansas,
[2:10:41.600 --> 2:10:47.280]  62 or 64 channels on the air, all kinds of entertainment, everything from news to classics
[2:10:47.280 --> 2:10:48.280]  to sports.
[2:10:48.280 --> 2:10:50.520]  By the way, most cable is not real HD.
[2:10:50.520 --> 2:10:54.960]  What I get in Austin is so crisp when I watch a football game or something that I cannot
[2:10:54.960 --> 2:10:59.120]  believe compared to what I get because they're compressing it off cable folks.
[2:10:59.120 --> 2:11:00.120]  They're compressing it.
[2:11:00.120 --> 2:11:01.120]  That is good.
[2:11:01.120 --> 2:11:02.120]  Right.
[2:11:02.120 --> 2:11:03.120]  Right.
[2:11:03.120 --> 2:11:06.360]  You can get by with even less bandwidth over the air because of exactly what you said.
[2:11:06.360 --> 2:11:07.360]  There's no middleman.
[2:11:07.360 --> 2:11:10.720]  It's not going to the cable company, going into their system, being compressed, being
[2:11:10.720 --> 2:11:13.320]  downsized, being shipped back out to you.
[2:11:13.320 --> 2:11:15.280]  It is just the way it was intended.
[2:11:15.280 --> 2:11:18.280]  And I mean, really, we're in the middle of a renaissance here and it's exactly what
[2:11:18.280 --> 2:11:19.280]  you say.
[2:11:19.280 --> 2:11:21.080]  People are watching TV.
[2:11:21.080 --> 2:11:22.360]  It's not watching them.
[2:11:22.360 --> 2:11:23.360]  It's traditional.
[2:11:23.360 --> 2:11:24.360]  It's going back to the roots.
[2:11:24.360 --> 2:11:25.360]  And I want to be clear.
[2:11:25.360 --> 2:11:26.720]  And all I can say is thanks globalists.
[2:11:26.720 --> 2:11:27.720]  You're the ones who caused this.
[2:11:27.720 --> 2:11:28.720]  Exactly.
[2:11:28.720 --> 2:11:29.720]  I want to be clear.
[2:11:29.720 --> 2:11:30.720]  There's two.
[2:11:30.720 --> 2:11:31.720]  And they're great.
[2:11:31.720 --> 2:11:34.720]  It's just that broadcast TV is so cool now in HD.
[2:11:34.720 --> 2:11:36.320]  And again, I just didn't even know.
[2:11:36.320 --> 2:11:40.240]  So I got this condo two years ago and it's just crazy.
[2:11:40.240 --> 2:11:44.640]  And now at my house, we have got the digital antennas and that's what we watch.
[2:11:44.640 --> 2:11:51.400]  And it's like Hawaii 5.0, Gilligan's Island, I agree, Magini, Dallas, stuff from the 90s,
[2:11:51.400 --> 2:11:52.880]  new stuff.
[2:11:52.880 --> 2:11:57.160]  Like when the Olympics was on, I didn't know there were 10 channels of Olympics on TV.
[2:11:57.160 --> 2:11:59.680]  I mean, it's like, my God, this is way better than cable.
[2:11:59.680 --> 2:12:05.160]  And people don't know that it's free after you buy the antenna.
[2:12:05.160 --> 2:12:06.160]  So I'm digressing.
[2:12:06.160 --> 2:12:07.160]  I want to go to phone calls.
[2:12:07.160 --> 2:12:08.160]  But what you said is so true.
[2:12:08.160 --> 2:12:12.120]  Since they're taking over the internet, these big platforms, radio stations and TV stations,
[2:12:12.120 --> 2:12:15.680]  the only successful ones I've talked to top consultants are mainly liberal ones that are
[2:12:15.680 --> 2:12:16.680]  doing this now.
[2:12:16.680 --> 2:12:20.720]  Normally liberals fail and talk radio and TV, but places like LA, San Francisco, some
[2:12:20.720 --> 2:12:21.720]  conservatives are doing it.
[2:12:21.720 --> 2:12:26.840]  They make it about community events, local coverage, special shows, the radio shows.
[2:12:26.840 --> 2:12:31.440]  Some will cast some TV shows, kind of what I invented doing, or what I pioneered doing.
[2:12:31.440 --> 2:12:36.680]  And so, like you said, put on Patriot shows, One American News Network, whatever it is,
[2:12:36.680 --> 2:12:38.180]  Alex Jones, whatever.
[2:12:38.180 --> 2:12:42.640]  And in a few months, you'll get that core of activist and then they'll get involved in
[2:12:42.640 --> 2:12:43.640]  events.
[2:12:43.640 --> 2:12:45.760]  They'll get involved in boosting the station.
[2:12:45.760 --> 2:12:50.160]  They'll get involved in doing so many things like you just discovered, and again, it creates
[2:12:50.160 --> 2:12:51.160]  community again.
[2:12:51.160 --> 2:12:53.560]  And it's all there waiting for everybody.
[2:12:53.560 --> 2:12:58.840]  And UHF, VHF, digital television, I found, is the perfect venue.
[2:12:58.840 --> 2:12:59.840]  I agree completely.
[2:12:59.840 --> 2:13:01.240]  I couldn't have said it better myself.
[2:13:01.240 --> 2:13:02.240]  And it's so exciting.
[2:13:02.240 --> 2:13:05.040]  I mean, when we first kind of started this, we were just kind of calling, hey, can we
[2:13:05.040 --> 2:13:06.600]  carry the Alex Jones show?
[2:13:06.600 --> 2:13:09.000]  Well, what if we want to carry David Knight as a possible?
[2:13:09.000 --> 2:13:10.000]  We can have both.
[2:13:10.000 --> 2:13:11.480]  Well, what about Owen Schreuer and War Room?
[2:13:11.480 --> 2:13:13.000]  That would be really cool to have.
[2:13:13.000 --> 2:13:16.440]  And before you know it, you guys are saying, well, you know, we've kind of got this prototype
[2:13:16.440 --> 2:13:17.440]  of a TV network.
[2:13:17.440 --> 2:13:18.440]  Would you like to carry it?
[2:13:18.440 --> 2:13:20.440]  And we go, yes, absolutely.
[2:13:20.440 --> 2:13:21.600]  Let's do that right now.
[2:13:21.600 --> 2:13:26.760]  It's very exciting to see infowars on the cutting edge as usual.
[2:13:26.760 --> 2:13:27.760]  Let's go to some phone calls.
[2:13:27.760 --> 2:13:30.520]  Again, please join us for a full hour to the 50-hour broadcast, Tom, as we've got George
[2:13:30.520 --> 2:13:31.520]  Norrie coming up.
[2:13:31.520 --> 2:13:32.520]  And I didn't realize we'd double booked.
[2:13:32.520 --> 2:13:34.760]  And I want to hear from George Norrie as well.
[2:13:34.760 --> 2:13:39.200]  Again, let's go ahead and take a call from Gavin in Florida.
[2:13:39.200 --> 2:13:40.440]  You're on the air with Tom Papert.
[2:13:40.440 --> 2:13:41.440]  Go ahead.
[2:13:41.440 --> 2:13:42.440]  Hey, hello?
[2:13:42.440 --> 2:13:43.440]  Yes, sir.
[2:13:43.440 --> 2:13:44.440]  Go ahead.
[2:13:44.440 --> 2:13:45.440]  Are you hearing me?
[2:13:45.440 --> 2:13:46.440]  Yes, sir.
[2:13:46.440 --> 2:13:47.440]  Hey, how are you?
[2:13:47.440 --> 2:13:48.440]  Good, brother.
[2:13:48.440 --> 2:13:49.440]  I just wanted to let you know that I was watching your show.
[2:13:49.440 --> 2:13:52.840]  This is the first time that I've ever called anyone like this.
[2:13:52.840 --> 2:13:53.840]  Thank you.
[2:13:53.840 --> 2:13:56.000]  I like them truly upset.
[2:13:56.000 --> 2:14:02.960]  I call as a single male, a white male, of course, but I have no kids.
[2:14:02.960 --> 2:14:06.360]  But I'm calling because of your drag queen story hour.
[2:14:06.360 --> 2:14:09.840]  It's coming to Jacksonville.
[2:14:09.840 --> 2:14:12.960]  And I called the places that are not doing any background checks.
[2:14:12.960 --> 2:14:18.200]  They're not doing any background checks in any of the states.
[2:14:18.200 --> 2:14:30.320]  And in fact, I called the New York City chapter head of all of it, John Hamlet, called him.
[2:14:30.320 --> 2:14:32.040]  They're not doing background checks.
[2:14:32.040 --> 2:14:35.920]  So they're using this as a vehicle to bring this into your public libraries.
[2:14:35.920 --> 2:14:41.720]  Yeah, no, this was created by a convicted murderer that used a hatchet and buzz saws
[2:14:41.720 --> 2:14:46.760]  to cut up his boyfriend and who says, we want to corrupt your children.
[2:14:46.760 --> 2:14:47.760]  We're going to groom them.
[2:14:47.760 --> 2:14:49.160]  I mean, I've played the clips.
[2:14:49.160 --> 2:14:51.540]  They're saying we're coming to corrupt your children.
[2:14:51.540 --> 2:14:52.960]  We're not going to tell the parents.
[2:14:52.960 --> 2:14:54.880]  In many cases, we're not going to do a background check.
[2:14:54.880 --> 2:14:55.880]  We're coming.
[2:14:55.880 --> 2:14:58.360]  And the liberals go, oh, yeah, bro.
[2:14:58.360 --> 2:15:00.720]  I want everyone to flood their line.
[2:15:00.720 --> 2:15:04.560]  I want everyone to call the event managers of everywhere in Jacksonville.
[2:15:04.560 --> 2:15:09.360]  They're having a hamburger, Mary's and cultivate Jack hamburger, Mary's on Sunday.
[2:15:09.360 --> 2:15:11.120]  Well, here's the deal, sir.
[2:15:11.120 --> 2:15:12.120]  Let me say this.
[2:15:12.120 --> 2:15:14.360]  Everyone should check their local listening peacefully and lawfully.
[2:15:14.360 --> 2:15:15.880]  Go expose it.
[2:15:15.880 --> 2:15:16.880]  Police should run the plates.
[2:15:16.880 --> 2:15:19.600]  There's a lot of sex offenders are going to be there, obviously, like flies that you
[2:15:19.600 --> 2:15:24.520]  know what, but, but, but, sir, they just canceled drag queen story time in Houston.
[2:15:24.520 --> 2:15:26.960]  They just canceled it in four cities in England.
[2:15:26.960 --> 2:15:31.440]  It's a global movement to test and prepare and groom your children.
[2:15:31.440 --> 2:15:33.520]  And that is a absolute fact.
[2:15:33.520 --> 2:15:34.600]  So thank you so much, Gavin.
[2:15:34.600 --> 2:15:41.880]  I'm glad you called, but yes, they're having one this Friday into Bronvos, Texas, indoctrinating
[2:15:41.880 --> 2:15:46.560]  children, teaching them giant fat men in disguises can rub their hands all over them
[2:15:46.560 --> 2:15:48.840]  and tell them about their rear ends.
[2:15:48.840 --> 2:15:51.000]  I'm telling you, it is the sickest evil.
[2:15:51.000 --> 2:15:55.520]  This is how evil comes right in your face, smiling with men dressed up like clowns.
[2:15:55.520 --> 2:15:59.200]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.

[2:19:58.960 --> 2:20:16.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:20:16.760 --> 2:20:19.840]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, Comp Pappets, our guest, George Norris, popping in.
[2:20:19.840 --> 2:20:23.360]  He's probably got one of the first or second largest radio shows in the world, need to
[2:20:23.360 --> 2:20:24.360]  know, introduction.
[2:20:24.360 --> 2:20:28.160]  Want to get his take on the draconian censorship, it's accelerating and how he thinks we stop
[2:20:28.160 --> 2:20:29.160]  it.
[2:20:29.160 --> 2:20:34.600]  I'll be back tonight, I'm going to be hosting 8 to 10 at least, got some very big special
[2:20:34.600 --> 2:20:35.600]  guests coming up.
[2:20:35.600 --> 2:20:44.080]  When I was out in LA with Joe Rogan on his podcast, it is the biggest podcast in the
[2:20:44.080 --> 2:20:45.080]  world.
[2:20:45.080 --> 2:20:49.120]  I've got the third largest and second largest podcast, Elon Musk is still number one at
[2:20:49.120 --> 2:20:50.120]  like 40 million views.
[2:20:50.120 --> 2:20:54.280]  But if you add it all together, I'm at about 30 million right now, and it's taken a year
[2:20:54.280 --> 2:20:59.320]  for him to get to 40 million, so I think we're going to break that record soon.
[2:20:59.320 --> 2:21:02.040]  But Joe's like, oh yeah, I'll fly in a day early, and then I'll come on the show blah
[2:21:02.040 --> 2:21:05.840]  blah blah, and now he's flying in a little bit later, but I'll get an interview regardless,
[2:21:05.840 --> 2:21:11.120]  but he thinks he'll be in here like one or two tomorrow, but that's not set in stone
[2:21:11.120 --> 2:21:12.120]  yet.
[2:21:12.120 --> 2:21:15.680]  So look for that, do a pretty hard hitting interview, pretty informative interview.
[2:21:15.680 --> 2:21:19.600]  And I like how Joe's gotten after the censorship now, and he's really standing up to it, that's
[2:21:19.600 --> 2:21:20.600]  what I wanted.
[2:21:20.600 --> 2:21:22.160]  I wasn't trying to be mean to him to get him to do that.
[2:21:22.160 --> 2:21:26.520]  I was going to cut bait, but a lot of things went on, me and Joe had a lot of private conversations.
[2:21:26.520 --> 2:21:31.680]  We probably talked six, seven hours total, three or four hours before, then in person
[2:21:31.680 --> 2:21:35.440]  a few hours, then a few more hours, and so I figured I was going on with Joe and I understand
[2:21:35.440 --> 2:21:39.280]  it, and I think I went a little bit overboard going after Joe because I just get a little
[2:21:39.280 --> 2:21:40.440]  bit wild out here sometime.
[2:21:40.440 --> 2:21:45.520]  Tom Papert's our guest right now, and we've got so many calls here to get to.
[2:21:45.520 --> 2:21:51.280]  I see questions for pro-choicers, abortion topic, we've got Lucas, the media attacks
[2:21:51.280 --> 2:21:55.840]  on Info Wars, Chase, and let's talk about the abortion issue in the twilight zone.
[2:21:55.840 --> 2:21:57.640]  Let's go to Chase, he's been holding the longest.
[2:21:57.640 --> 2:21:58.640]  Chase, you're on the air.
[2:21:58.640 --> 2:21:59.640]  Thanks for holding.
[2:21:59.640 --> 2:22:00.640]  Go ahead.
[2:22:00.640 --> 2:22:01.640]  Hey, Alex.
[2:22:01.640 --> 2:22:04.920]  Thank you so much for taking my call, and thank you for doing this broadcast standing
[2:22:04.920 --> 2:22:05.920]  up for free speech.
[2:22:05.920 --> 2:22:09.320]  You know, I'm trying to do the same thing with the page that I started on YouTube with
[2:22:09.320 --> 2:22:13.280]  your reporter challenge, and I do live shows every night, and I also put together kind
[2:22:13.280 --> 2:22:14.280]  of edited videos.
[2:22:14.280 --> 2:22:15.280]  Thank you.
[2:22:15.280 --> 2:22:19.480]  And on this issue, on this issue of abortion, I really think we have an opportunity, I'm
[2:22:19.480 --> 2:22:24.640]  in the process of putting it together actually, if you remember one of the most popular episodes,
[2:22:24.640 --> 2:22:27.240]  the obsolescent man, and Mr. Wordsworth.
[2:22:27.240 --> 2:22:28.960]  Oh, we used to play that all the time.
[2:22:28.960 --> 2:22:31.760]  We should dig that up and play it, start the next segment.
[2:22:31.760 --> 2:22:35.480]  But the thing is, if you relate that to what they're doing with abortion now, they are
[2:22:35.480 --> 2:22:39.440]  saying the exact same thing that the state says in that episode.
[2:22:39.440 --> 2:22:42.120]  They say that Mr. Wordsworth has no youth.
[2:22:42.120 --> 2:22:43.400]  He has no worth.
[2:22:43.400 --> 2:22:48.120]  He is attached to the healthy body and so needs to be eliminated, and that is the exact
[2:22:48.120 --> 2:22:49.120]  thing.
[2:22:49.120 --> 2:22:50.120]  That's bioethics.
[2:22:50.120 --> 2:22:51.120]  That's authoritarianism.
[2:22:51.120 --> 2:22:52.120]  That's eugenics.
[2:22:52.120 --> 2:22:57.520]  Rod Serling, who was a paratrooper commando in World War II, a hero, he was a smart guy.
[2:22:57.520 --> 2:22:59.120]  He wasn't making that up.
[2:22:59.120 --> 2:23:01.480]  He was copying that from the Nazis.
[2:23:01.480 --> 2:23:05.440]  And so that whole thing is about that, and Rod Serling was absolutely on target.
[2:23:05.440 --> 2:23:09.840]  Listen, you know why Beto O'Rourke, even though he outspent Ted Cruz five to one and engaged
[2:23:09.840 --> 2:23:12.160]  in election fraud, lost to Ted Cruz?
[2:23:12.160 --> 2:23:16.080]  Because Hispanic Christians, this came out in the demographics and studies.
[2:23:16.080 --> 2:23:19.320]  This is highly studied here in Texas.
[2:23:19.320 --> 2:23:23.280]  Hispanic Americans who were Christian knew that Beto O'Rourke was for partial birth abortion,
[2:23:23.280 --> 2:23:28.120]  and they called Hispanic members of their family and said, you better not vote for Beto
[2:23:28.120 --> 2:23:30.120]  O'Rourke.
[2:23:30.120 --> 2:23:33.040]  And that's why they lost in key Hispanic counties.
[2:23:33.040 --> 2:23:34.040]  It's the only reason.
[2:23:34.040 --> 2:23:35.720]  They just thought Hispanics would just vote.
[2:23:35.720 --> 2:23:36.720]  You know who did vote?
[2:23:36.720 --> 2:23:37.720]  Dumb young people.
[2:23:37.720 --> 2:23:43.280]  And I'm not saying all young folks are dumb, but millennial scum and buck-toothed white
[2:23:43.280 --> 2:23:44.280]  people.
[2:23:44.280 --> 2:23:47.360]  We're not putting white people down, but that's statistically who just fawned after him.
[2:23:47.360 --> 2:23:48.360]  And it's disgusting.
[2:23:48.360 --> 2:23:53.160]  I'll vote for a Hispanic black person, a purple person, if they're pro-life, pro-gun, pro-freedom.
[2:23:53.160 --> 2:23:54.760]  Beto O'Rourke is a damn cancer.
[2:23:54.760 --> 2:23:55.760]  Go ahead, Chase.
[2:23:55.760 --> 2:23:56.760]  Yes, exactly.
[2:23:56.760 --> 2:24:02.240]  And you think about how much things have changed from one generation to the next, where they
[2:24:02.240 --> 2:24:07.280]  made those episodes, and it was thought to be unbelievable that we would ever allow our
[2:24:07.280 --> 2:24:10.880]  state, our government, to look at human life that way.
[2:24:10.880 --> 2:24:14.240]  And now you look at today at how it's accepted, how it's pushed.
[2:24:14.240 --> 2:24:15.240]  It's just really troubling.
[2:24:15.240 --> 2:24:19.440]  And so, again, I'm in the process of kind of making this where instead of Mr. Wordsworth,
[2:24:19.440 --> 2:24:24.360]  I want to have the story of a baby that's about to be aborted by the state, and it's
[2:24:24.360 --> 2:24:29.240]  going to be visually aligned with that episode, but completely updated.
[2:24:29.240 --> 2:24:30.240]  Well, listen to this.
[2:24:30.240 --> 2:24:31.240]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[2:24:31.240 --> 2:24:32.240]  Thank you so much.
[2:24:32.240 --> 2:24:35.520]  David Knight started his own YouTube channel because all the others had been banned about
[2:24:35.520 --> 2:24:36.680]  two weeks ago.
[2:24:36.680 --> 2:24:43.000]  He's very genteel, very gentlemanly, very matter-of-fact, very journalistic.
[2:24:43.000 --> 2:24:49.120]  He put up a thing defending Judge Gene and how Ilhan Omar is promoting Sharia law and
[2:24:49.120 --> 2:24:53.840]  showed her saying it, and they did a strike on the channel and threatened to take it down.
[2:24:53.840 --> 2:24:56.200]  This is a total censorship reign of terror.
[2:24:56.200 --> 2:24:57.200]  Thank you, Chase.
[2:24:57.200 --> 2:24:59.120]  You want to comment on that, Tom Pepper?
[2:24:59.120 --> 2:25:03.840]  No, I do think that it's extremely telling that we're reinventing the same exact type
[2:25:03.840 --> 2:25:08.880]  of eugenics that was foist upon people half a century ago, and I'm looking forward to
[2:25:08.880 --> 2:25:09.880]  seeing that.
[2:25:09.880 --> 2:25:12.000]  I think that when Chase puts that together, it could be very interesting.
[2:25:12.000 --> 2:25:16.280]  Yeah, Chase, make sure you bombard all of our emails and everything to make sure we
[2:25:16.280 --> 2:25:18.040]  get it because we get so much great stuff.
[2:25:18.040 --> 2:25:20.920]  People all the time are like, hey, you saw my son's protein bar thing we did for him.
[2:25:20.920 --> 2:25:21.920]  I'm like, no, I didn't.
[2:25:21.920 --> 2:25:24.240]  And so I'm like, you didn't hear about the fellow reserve?
[2:25:24.240 --> 2:25:25.240]  And I'm like, no, I didn't.
[2:25:25.240 --> 2:25:30.280]  A lot of times we're just like, we know a lot, but they say the wise man learns how
[2:25:30.280 --> 2:25:32.360]  much he doesn't know, you know, Tom?
[2:25:32.360 --> 2:25:33.800]  There's only so many hours in a day.
[2:25:33.800 --> 2:25:36.360]  I know exactly how you feel at a much smaller level.
[2:25:36.360 --> 2:25:39.840]  You know, you get so many emails, you get so many messages, it's hard to stay on top
[2:25:39.840 --> 2:25:40.840]  of everything.
[2:25:40.840 --> 2:25:44.240]  And that's why the people who are persistent, that's why they break through.
[2:25:44.240 --> 2:25:45.240]  That's what I've learned.
[2:25:45.240 --> 2:25:48.480]  Yeah, well, people like you, Tom, that have reached hundreds of millions of people, you
[2:25:48.480 --> 2:25:51.160]  always say, oh, at a much smaller level, you're very self deprecating.
[2:25:51.160 --> 2:25:57.040]  I want listeners to get this from a single mom, to an auto mechanic, to a, to an old
[2:25:57.040 --> 2:26:01.240]  man, to a young, whoever, people spread the word, word of mouth, people creating their
[2:26:01.240 --> 2:26:05.040]  own YouTube video, people calling into a radio show, people going to city council, people
[2:26:05.040 --> 2:26:09.720]  praying to God, people putting energy towards good is, is the ultimate power.
[2:26:09.720 --> 2:26:10.720]  It's everything.
[2:26:10.720 --> 2:26:11.720]  It's where the rubber meets the road.
[2:26:11.720 --> 2:26:17.320]  It's all those little things, you know, making breakfast for your kids, being loving person,
[2:26:17.320 --> 2:26:19.560]  trying to be honest, trying to be good.
[2:26:19.560 --> 2:26:21.560]  That's what makes the universe go around folks.
[2:26:21.560 --> 2:26:25.000]  So don't ever think cause you don't have a big show or whatever that you're not important.
[2:26:25.000 --> 2:26:26.320]  You're everything.
[2:26:26.320 --> 2:26:30.640]  They want this show shut down because you tune in and hear things you already know, but
[2:26:30.640 --> 2:26:36.080]  it reaffirms what you know and gives you aid and comfort.
[2:26:36.080 --> 2:26:37.080]  And that's what they don't want.
[2:26:37.080 --> 2:26:38.360]  They don't want me having aid and comfort.
[2:26:38.360 --> 2:26:39.960]  They don't want you having aid and comfort.
[2:26:39.960 --> 2:26:43.280]  They don't know we're getting bullied and attacked, you know, that, that we've got friends that
[2:26:43.280 --> 2:26:45.280]  we know that we're moving in the right direction.
[2:26:45.280 --> 2:26:48.600]  They don't want you to hear how we're winning.
[2:26:48.600 --> 2:26:50.120]  They don't want real people.
[2:26:50.120 --> 2:26:53.080]  They want somebody who's going to read from a teleprompter and it's going to be their
[2:26:53.080 --> 2:26:55.640]  talking points, whether it's CNN or Fox News.
[2:26:55.640 --> 2:26:56.800]  That's all it is now.
[2:26:56.800 --> 2:26:59.360]  And they don't like real human beings having discussions.
[2:26:59.360 --> 2:27:02.240]  I'm sure they hate that you have collars who bring this type of stuff up.
[2:27:02.240 --> 2:27:06.640]  I'm sure they hate that you advocate living a normal value based lifestyle.
[2:27:06.640 --> 2:27:10.120]  I'm sure that they hate that you call him Peter O'Rourke or Robert Francis O'Rourke
[2:27:10.120 --> 2:27:13.440]  or whatever he is and you don't sit there and say, Oh, it's wonderful.
[2:27:13.440 --> 2:27:18.360]  And one point that you brought up, you mentioned the type of people who go to the veto or support
[2:27:18.360 --> 2:27:19.360]  veto.
[2:27:19.360 --> 2:27:25.080]  And if you look, they look aesthetically, like the exact same people who bring their
[2:27:25.080 --> 2:27:27.840]  toddlers to go see the drag queens.
[2:27:27.840 --> 2:27:29.800]  This is the same type of chicken net.
[2:27:29.800 --> 2:27:30.960]  They look soulless.
[2:27:30.960 --> 2:27:32.160]  They can hardly talk.
[2:27:32.160 --> 2:27:34.840]  They never know what anything is when we talk to them.
[2:27:34.840 --> 2:27:37.280]  And it's like, you'll want to talk to them and find a smart person.
[2:27:37.280 --> 2:27:40.080]  No, we'll talk to 200 of them that they could be black.
[2:27:40.080 --> 2:27:41.080]  They could be white.
[2:27:41.080 --> 2:27:42.080]  They're mainly white.
[2:27:42.080 --> 2:27:43.080]  They could be young.
[2:27:43.080 --> 2:27:44.080]  They're all idiots.
[2:27:44.080 --> 2:27:45.080]  Right.
[2:27:45.080 --> 2:27:48.480]  And they have nothing going on because again, they get programmed.
[2:27:48.480 --> 2:27:49.680]  They're in PCs.
[2:27:49.680 --> 2:27:51.280]  They're the meme in real life.
[2:27:51.280 --> 2:27:52.720]  They get programmed from the news.
[2:27:52.720 --> 2:27:54.560]  They get programmed from the schools.
[2:27:54.560 --> 2:27:55.560]  Drag queens.
[2:27:55.560 --> 2:27:56.560]  Good.
[2:27:56.560 --> 2:27:57.560]  Alex Jones.
[2:27:57.560 --> 2:27:58.560]  Bad.
[2:27:58.560 --> 2:27:59.560]  And that's all they know.
[2:27:59.560 --> 2:28:00.560]  And they repeat it incessantly.
[2:28:00.560 --> 2:28:03.200]  And it almost makes it boring to interact with these people.
[2:28:03.200 --> 2:28:05.280]  We can call them drag queens.
[2:28:05.280 --> 2:28:06.280]  We got it.
[2:28:06.280 --> 2:28:07.280]  And that's what it's called.
[2:28:07.280 --> 2:28:08.280]  We have to address it as that.
[2:28:08.280 --> 2:28:14.400]  But drag teams drag queen story time is a worldwide event with Nambla and others funding
[2:28:14.400 --> 2:28:21.400]  and supporting, sending in men dressed in bizarre clown outfits in disguises to basically
[2:28:21.400 --> 2:28:27.600]  recruit and prepare your children for an LGBT situation.
[2:28:27.600 --> 2:28:28.600]  That's exactly what it is.
[2:28:28.600 --> 2:28:32.320]  And, you know, five years ago, we would have rightly made fun of this and said it belongs
[2:28:32.320 --> 2:28:34.040]  in a circus side show.
[2:28:34.040 --> 2:28:40.400]  And now things have accelerated so fast and so furiously that, again, toddlers go see
[2:28:40.400 --> 2:28:44.600]  the fat guy in a dress with a beard and his junk hanging out.
[2:28:44.600 --> 2:28:45.600]  Perfect.
[2:28:45.600 --> 2:28:46.600]  It's so progressive.
[2:28:46.600 --> 2:28:47.600]  It's liberal.
[2:28:47.600 --> 2:28:48.600]  It's wonderful.
[2:28:48.600 --> 2:28:49.600]  It's great.
[2:28:49.600 --> 2:28:50.600]  Tom Pappert, thank you so much.
[2:28:50.600 --> 2:28:51.600]  God bless you.

[2:29:58.520 --> 2:30:00.240]  There is no set stasis.
[2:30:00.240 --> 2:30:01.480]  There is no managed system.
[2:30:01.480 --> 2:30:03.080]  There is no uncontenuous.
[2:30:03.080 --> 2:30:06.360]  The continuum is always launching forward in the future.
[2:30:06.360 --> 2:30:09.680]  So you support us and get creative and get fired up.

[2:30:10.960 --> 2:30:11.960]  We'll be here forever.
[2:30:11.960 --> 2:30:12.960]  We'll turn the whole thing around.
[2:30:12.960 --> 2:30:17.360]  Our grandchildren on Mars basis and jump basis and God knows what are going to look
[2:30:17.360 --> 2:30:19.800]  back and say, you know, we struggled here.
[2:30:19.800 --> 2:30:20.800]  We made it.
[2:30:20.800 --> 2:30:22.200]  And that's really where this goes.
[2:30:22.200 --> 2:30:24.440]  But God's got a big war for you ready.
[2:30:24.440 --> 2:30:28.120]  And so if you can't face George Soros and Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler and Mal
[2:30:28.120 --> 2:30:31.600]  Satang, are you going to really be able to face the other stuff?
[2:30:31.600 --> 2:30:35.840]  Because God wants warriors that are smart and are ready to build things and are also
[2:30:35.840 --> 2:30:36.840]  ready to fight.
[2:30:36.840 --> 2:30:39.400]  You don't go to the next level without getting a big weight put on your back.
[2:30:39.400 --> 2:30:41.400]  And I mean, I don't know what's going to happen to me in the future.
[2:30:41.400 --> 2:30:45.040]  I mean, all I know is I want to go with the master built.
[2:30:45.040 --> 2:30:46.240]  I want to go to the next level.
[2:30:46.240 --> 2:30:50.880]  I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced, not these devil worshipers.
[2:30:50.880 --> 2:30:53.480]  They're cold and failed and feels like being a tomb.
[2:30:53.480 --> 2:30:54.640]  I want life.
[2:30:54.640 --> 2:30:56.280]  I want Jesus.
[2:30:56.280 --> 2:31:00.040]  Our grandparents, the great grandparents, they can food during the falls.
[2:31:00.040 --> 2:31:01.520]  They have it during the winter.
[2:31:01.520 --> 2:31:05.280]  And that's what I'm talking about at M4WordsTour.com.

[2:31:56.200 --> 2:32:01.080]  There are thousands of ideologies out there, hundreds of different political systems.
[2:32:01.080 --> 2:32:04.080]  And most of them are funded by the globalist.
[2:32:04.080 --> 2:32:06.680]  M4Words is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[2:32:06.680 --> 2:32:10.240]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[2:32:10.240 --> 2:32:11.880]  I didn't invent all this.
[2:32:11.880 --> 2:32:16.760]  I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana, and what really works for humanity, and I'm
[2:32:16.760 --> 2:32:18.240]  simply trying to bring it back.
[2:32:18.240 --> 2:32:22.520]  And lo and behold, it's super popular like it's always been.
[2:32:22.520 --> 2:32:26.520]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately, because we have the
[2:32:26.520 --> 2:32:30.400]  light in the dark of the night that's since chills up my spine.
[2:32:30.400 --> 2:32:35.000]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and M4Words by buying the great products at
[2:32:35.000 --> 2:32:39.360]  M4WordsTour.com, by spreading the articles, by spreading the videos, and by praying for
[2:32:39.360 --> 2:32:43.960]  this operation and for praying for this nation and the world for peace and discernment.
[2:32:43.960 --> 2:32:48.840]  For myself and the whole M4Words family, I want to thank all of you for what you've done.
[2:32:48.840 --> 2:32:51.800]  Because without you, M4Words is nothing.
[2:32:51.800 --> 2:33:10.760]  You are the M4Words, and I salute you.
[2:33:10.760 --> 2:33:15.920]  You walk into this room at your own risk, because it leads to the future.
[2:33:15.920 --> 2:33:19.360]  Not a future that will be, but one that might be.
[2:33:19.360 --> 2:33:21.560]  This is not a new world.
[2:33:21.560 --> 2:33:25.960]  It is simply an extension of what began in the old one.
[2:33:25.960 --> 2:33:30.080]  It has patterned itself after every dictator who has ever planted the ripping imprint of
[2:33:30.080 --> 2:33:34.400]  a boot on the pages of history since the beginning of time.
[2:33:34.400 --> 2:33:40.360]  It has refinements, technological advances, and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction
[2:33:40.360 --> 2:33:42.480]  of human freedom.
[2:33:42.480 --> 2:33:48.440]  But like every one of the super states that preceded it, it has one iron rule.
[2:33:48.440 --> 2:33:55.800]  Take is an enemy, and truth is a menace.
[2:33:55.800 --> 2:34:01.200]  This is Mr. Romney Wordsworth in his last 48 hours on Earth.
[2:34:01.200 --> 2:34:05.280]  He's a citizen of the state, but will soon have to be eliminated.
[2:34:05.280 --> 2:34:09.920]  Because he is built out of flesh, and because he has a mind.
[2:34:09.920 --> 2:34:25.240]  Mr. Romney Wordsworth, who will draw his last breaths in the twilight zone.
[2:34:25.240 --> 2:34:28.400]  Well, Juhas means I hate you in German, but what would it be?
[2:34:28.400 --> 2:34:30.800]  I love you.
[2:34:30.800 --> 2:34:31.880]  I love George Norrie.
[2:34:31.880 --> 2:34:37.200]  You know, if the globalists want to blame somebody on being sarcastic, it was in full
[2:34:37.200 --> 2:34:41.800]  wars in the work we did that was already super viral and Bohemian Grove and a lot of other
[2:34:41.800 --> 2:34:44.040]  events in our underground films.
[2:34:44.040 --> 2:34:51.120]  But George Norrie, when he took over back in like 2002-2003, he already had three or
[2:34:51.120 --> 2:34:57.880]  four or five Emmys under his belt, award-winning news director, naval veteran, officer, already
[2:34:57.880 --> 2:35:00.040]  a very successful syndicated radio host.
[2:35:00.040 --> 2:35:05.160]  He took over for the late great Art Bell, now late great, and back then, let me tell
[2:35:05.160 --> 2:35:06.160]  you something.
[2:35:06.160 --> 2:35:08.080]  He had me on and put his job on the line.
[2:35:08.080 --> 2:35:11.040]  I know the backside story, he didn't even know I know it, but I've talked to some of
[2:35:11.040 --> 2:35:14.760]  the executives, and they said, it's on you, buddy, because he'd only been on the air about
[2:35:14.760 --> 2:35:15.760]  a year.
[2:35:15.760 --> 2:35:18.920]  That, you know, one of the top shows in the world, probably the second, if not the largest
[2:35:18.920 --> 2:35:20.920]  show in the world.
[2:35:20.920 --> 2:35:25.760]  Him and Limbar, a neck and neck now on stations and affiliates, it's not about bragging.
[2:35:25.760 --> 2:35:30.600]  It's about when you've got everything and you put it on the line.
[2:35:30.600 --> 2:35:34.440]  And George brought me on for three hours, didn't script, didn't tell me what I could
[2:35:34.440 --> 2:35:36.720]  say, didn't do any of that.
[2:35:36.720 --> 2:35:40.760]  And then years later, I learned that his job was on the line, but he said, I'm going to
[2:35:40.760 --> 2:35:41.760]  do it.
[2:35:41.760 --> 2:35:42.760]  I'm going to interview this guy.
[2:35:42.760 --> 2:35:47.600]  And so, yeah, it's that show that helped really take us to the next level, then DrudgeReport.com,
[2:35:47.600 --> 2:35:48.600]  linking to us.
[2:35:48.600 --> 2:35:52.600]  I'm always very, very thankful to George Norrie, and it's great to know that people like him
[2:35:52.600 --> 2:35:57.200]  and Clyde Lewis and others are there who still have 10, 15 million viewers.
[2:35:57.200 --> 2:36:00.960]  George, you know, probably, I don't know, 16, 70 million a week, somebody like Clyde,
[2:36:00.960 --> 2:36:01.960]  like 5 million.
[2:36:01.960 --> 2:36:07.560]  It's good to know that people like him are still the biggest things out there, but corporate
[2:36:07.560 --> 2:36:09.200]  media, the internet, ignore it.
[2:36:09.200 --> 2:36:12.880]  So it's a perfect time to bring George Norrie of coast to coastam.com.
[2:36:12.880 --> 2:36:17.880]  He also hosts a national TV show as well to give us his take on Jordan Peterson's book,
[2:36:17.880 --> 2:36:24.360]  The 12 Steps to a Good Life Band in New Zealand, zero hedges, IP addresses now, the website
[2:36:24.360 --> 2:36:29.640]  now banned, you know, Limbaugh came out and said this guy's a leftist, he could have done
[2:36:29.640 --> 2:36:30.640]  it to blame right wingers.
[2:36:30.640 --> 2:36:31.640]  That's in the manifesto.
[2:36:31.640 --> 2:36:33.920]  That's why the rush is right or wrong.
[2:36:33.920 --> 2:36:34.920]  He has a right to say it.
[2:36:34.920 --> 2:36:39.000]  A new YouTube channel we had got taken down for me playing rush.
[2:36:39.000 --> 2:36:43.720]  So George, what do you make of this, this attack on free speech has gone into overdrive
[2:36:43.720 --> 2:36:47.280]  and, you know, you were going to run for president, they tried to draft you years ago.
[2:36:47.280 --> 2:36:50.840]  I wouldn't support anybody over Trump, but you, if I could draft you to do it because
[2:36:50.840 --> 2:36:53.680]  you've said you'd be pro-free speech.
[2:36:53.680 --> 2:36:58.760]  So as a journalist, as a naval officer, as a father, grandfather, I'm kind of ranting
[2:36:58.760 --> 2:37:01.160]  here with the time we have.
[2:37:01.160 --> 2:37:04.600]  What would you call this period we're in and what should be done because I like Trump,
[2:37:04.600 --> 2:37:07.240]  but I'm, I'm getting really upset about the censorship.
[2:37:07.240 --> 2:37:12.000]  Alex, we are in a situation, and it's great to be with you and get my friends.
[2:37:12.000 --> 2:37:13.600]  Keep fighting the good fight.
[2:37:13.600 --> 2:37:19.720]  We are in a situation right now that the First Amendment is under fire.
[2:37:19.720 --> 2:37:27.400]  Something is happening not only just in this country, but in this planet where the globalists,
[2:37:27.400 --> 2:37:34.560]  the people who think they're in charge, want to muffle free speech and hold back on our
[2:37:34.560 --> 2:37:37.240]  ability to tell the world how we feel.
[2:37:37.240 --> 2:37:39.160]  Now, there's a fine line here.
[2:37:39.160 --> 2:37:44.080]  I mean, I don't want to go to a baseball game with my family and have some guy in the back
[2:37:44.080 --> 2:37:45.800]  screaming obscenities.
[2:37:45.800 --> 2:37:46.960]  To me, that's not free speech.
[2:37:46.960 --> 2:37:48.720]  And plus that's a private event.
[2:37:48.720 --> 2:37:51.200]  Everybody's agreeing they're going for a baseball game.
[2:37:51.200 --> 2:37:52.360]  Exactly.
[2:37:52.360 --> 2:38:00.360]  But free speech is, it's what you do, and you're being muffled for things that I have
[2:38:00.360 --> 2:38:04.880]  never seen before in my life.
[2:38:04.880 --> 2:38:05.880]  People are panicking.
[2:38:05.880 --> 2:38:11.400]  They hear one thing about Alex Jones or some other individual, and they clip you because
[2:38:11.400 --> 2:38:14.040]  they think they've got the power to do it.
[2:38:14.040 --> 2:38:17.200]  That's very dangerous in this society.
[2:38:17.200 --> 2:38:21.120]  We're going to get to a point in this country, if we're not very careful, where the internet
[2:38:21.120 --> 2:38:27.960]  is going to be 100% controlled by government or by globalists, and they will tell you what
[2:38:27.960 --> 2:38:32.960]  you can see, what you can Google, and that's very dangerous for society.
[2:38:32.960 --> 2:38:33.960]  Absolutely right.
[2:38:33.960 --> 2:38:36.520]  I don't want to make this about me.
[2:38:36.520 --> 2:38:37.880]  It's about courage.
[2:38:37.880 --> 2:38:46.160]  What made you in 2003 have me on Brian Lamb attacked the next day, CNN attacked it?
[2:38:46.160 --> 2:38:47.160]  I mean, they were watching.
[2:38:47.160 --> 2:38:49.960]  It was one of your best shows ever, highest rated ever.
[2:38:49.960 --> 2:38:53.600]  What made you go to bat and have me on your show?
[2:38:53.600 --> 2:38:57.320]  The two goons that you sent to my house the night before.
[2:38:57.320 --> 2:39:03.960]  I'm kidding, but of course, look, I had a call from one of our listeners.
[2:39:03.960 --> 2:39:09.400]  I did not know you from Adam at that time, and he said, you got to have this guy named
[2:39:09.400 --> 2:39:11.000]  Alex Jones on your show.
[2:39:11.000 --> 2:39:16.000]  And of course, when a listener calls me and gives me information, I'm going to follow
[2:39:16.000 --> 2:39:18.880]  up on it because I care about my listeners.
[2:39:18.880 --> 2:39:25.480]  When I started listening to you on infowars.com, I did some research, and I said, boy, this
[2:39:25.480 --> 2:39:28.360]  guy, he could be a loose cannon.
[2:39:28.360 --> 2:39:31.200]  I better check into this guy a little bit more.
[2:39:31.200 --> 2:39:37.720]  And then I started listening to you more and more and more, and I said, you know what?
[2:39:37.720 --> 2:39:43.920]  About 90% of what this guy, Alex Jones, says is pretty right on, in my opinion.
[2:39:43.920 --> 2:39:46.000]  I'm going to put him on.
[2:39:46.000 --> 2:39:48.040]  And you were just electrifying.
[2:39:48.040 --> 2:39:54.960]  My phone's lit up faster than any other guest I've ever had on, and I decided I'm going
[2:39:54.960 --> 2:39:55.960]  to put Alex on.
[2:39:55.960 --> 2:39:59.960]  We're going to talk a little bit about rules and regulations.
[2:39:59.960 --> 2:40:02.680]  You're not a follow-up guy on the air.
[2:40:02.680 --> 2:40:08.800]  You understand the power of radio, and I took a chance, and it worked.
[2:40:08.800 --> 2:40:11.480]  It worked for me, and it worked for you at the time.
[2:40:11.480 --> 2:40:17.480]  I only brought that up because this 50-hour broadcast I'm doing until Saturday at 10 is
[2:40:17.480 --> 2:40:19.200]  about what do we do?
[2:40:19.200 --> 2:40:22.480]  I mean, my honeymoon is becoming over with Trump.
[2:40:22.480 --> 2:40:26.520]  I still like a lot of what he's done, America first, but, I mean, they're doing nothing
[2:40:26.520 --> 2:40:28.840]  while draconian censorship is happening to everybody.
[2:40:28.840 --> 2:40:32.960]  I mean, they had a major Democratic Party event two days ago where they said, take Ben Shapiro
[2:40:32.960 --> 2:40:33.960]  off the Internet.
[2:40:33.960 --> 2:40:34.960]  De-platform Ben Shapiro.
[2:40:34.960 --> 2:40:36.960]  I mean, this is getting dangerous.
[2:40:36.960 --> 2:40:40.480]  Yeah, it's out of control.
[2:40:40.480 --> 2:40:42.600]  It's crazy.
[2:40:42.600 --> 2:40:47.280]  It's what a communist nation would do to suppress its people.
[2:40:47.280 --> 2:40:48.800]  That's what you do.
[2:40:48.800 --> 2:40:54.360]  Before you begin to change government, you change the way the public has an ability to
[2:40:54.360 --> 2:40:56.200]  communicate and speak.
[2:40:56.200 --> 2:41:02.880]  I don't think they anticipated, Alex, years ago the strength of social media, the strength
[2:41:02.880 --> 2:41:08.200]  of the Internet, the strength of streaming, the strength of podcasting, I don't think
[2:41:08.200 --> 2:41:14.520]  anybody ever thought that we'd get this big, this strong, this soon, and they're scared
[2:41:14.520 --> 2:41:18.080]  now because they don't know how to handle the population, so they figure the only way
[2:41:18.080 --> 2:41:23.400]  they can is to clip everything and go back to the old days and make it even worse.
[2:41:23.400 --> 2:41:25.520]  And that's what's happening.
[2:41:25.520 --> 2:41:32.080]  We as Americans need to continue to fight the good fight and get the word out and keep
[2:41:32.080 --> 2:41:38.360]  pushing because in the long run, I believe we're going to win and I will keep pushing
[2:41:38.360 --> 2:41:40.480]  myself to make sure we do.
[2:41:40.480 --> 2:41:45.040]  I totally agree with you, and I remember when I was on with you 16, 17 years ago, you said
[2:41:45.040 --> 2:41:48.960]  that then, and nationalists, populists are getting elected everywhere, people are getting
[2:41:48.960 --> 2:41:52.720]  more into free market again, I mean, I agree with you that intellectually people are waking
[2:41:52.720 --> 2:41:56.600]  up and that's exactly why, as you said, the establishment's gotten scared, but how do
[2:41:56.600 --> 2:41:59.360]  they think they can put the toothpaste back on the tube?
[2:41:59.360 --> 2:42:01.760]  Well, that's a good question.
[2:42:01.760 --> 2:42:06.920]  They can't, but they think they can, and it's going to backfire on all of them.
[2:42:06.920 --> 2:42:12.280]  You just mentioned that some people had approached me years ago to see if I wanted to run for
[2:42:12.280 --> 2:42:13.280]  president.
[2:42:13.280 --> 2:42:14.280]  I'm not a Democrat.
[2:42:14.280 --> 2:42:15.280]  I'm not a Republican.
[2:42:15.280 --> 2:42:16.640]  I'm not a libertarian.
[2:42:16.640 --> 2:42:18.280]  I call it the way I see it.
[2:42:18.280 --> 2:42:22.960]  I don't even vote for president because I want to remain impartial when I'm on the year.
[2:42:22.960 --> 2:42:27.040]  I don't want anybody ever accusing me of favoritism or anything like that.
[2:42:27.040 --> 2:42:31.720]  I call it the way I see it, whether I think President Trump does a good job or not.
[2:42:31.720 --> 2:42:33.440]  I call it the way I see it.
[2:42:33.440 --> 2:42:38.440]  Do a little InfoWars poll for me if you can, throw my name in the Democratic hat because
[2:42:38.440 --> 2:42:39.960]  that's the opposition right now.
[2:42:39.960 --> 2:42:40.960]  You know what?
[2:42:40.960 --> 2:42:41.960]  It's funny you said that.
[2:42:41.960 --> 2:42:42.960]  Stay there.
[2:42:42.960 --> 2:42:43.960]  That's a genius idea.
[2:42:43.960 --> 2:42:45.200]  I'm going to go in there right now.
[2:42:45.200 --> 2:42:49.960]  We're going to put the top four Democrats up with George Norrie's name, infowars.com
[2:42:49.960 --> 2:42:50.960]  poll.
[2:42:50.960 --> 2:42:51.960]  We should do more polls.
[2:42:51.960 --> 2:42:52.960]  Sometimes we get like 200,000 people.
[2:42:52.960 --> 2:42:53.960]  Usually it's about 50,000.
[2:42:53.960 --> 2:42:59.280]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful
[2:42:59.280 --> 2:43:03.440]  products ever made, Alpha Power, at 50% off.

[2:45:56.480 --> 2:46:01.360]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[2:46:01.360 --> 2:46:05.840]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients, and stress, you may not be able to get all
[2:46:05.840 --> 2:46:10.880]  the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals needed daily.
[2:46:10.880 --> 2:46:16.120]  That's why InfoWare's Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula, the new platinum

[2:47:19.320 --> 2:47:23.560]  We're going back to George Norrie.
[2:47:23.560 --> 2:47:27.480]  I'm going to host the fourth hour and I'm going to get to every caller that's been holding,
[2:47:27.480 --> 2:47:32.200]  Charity and Dave and Lee and Dustin and Jessica and Sean and Dennis and Randy and Lucas and
[2:47:32.200 --> 2:47:33.200]  Morgan and Jeff.
[2:47:33.200 --> 2:47:34.600]  I'm going to go bam, bam, bam.
[2:47:34.600 --> 2:47:36.480]  George Norrie leaves us here in about 10 minutes.
[2:47:36.480 --> 2:47:39.880]  We're in the 50-hour broadcast going until Saturday at 10 a.m.
[2:47:39.880 --> 2:47:43.160]  I'm going to ask George Norrie if he does run for president.
[2:47:43.160 --> 2:47:48.040]  He's a smart guy, a naval veteran, won three Emmys, all the rest of it, grandpa, and young
[2:47:48.040 --> 2:47:50.060]  grandpa and dad.
[2:47:50.060 --> 2:47:51.060]  What would he do for the First Amendment?
[2:47:51.060 --> 2:47:52.060]  Because that's what this is all about.
[2:47:52.060 --> 2:47:53.560]  What are we going to do to save the First Amendment?
[2:47:53.560 --> 2:47:57.680]  I'm going to talk to George Norrie here in just a moment.
[2:47:57.680 --> 2:48:00.720]  But first, we're running a 50-hour broadcast.
[2:48:00.720 --> 2:48:04.440]  It's a fundraiser as well to defend our operation against the globalists.
[2:48:04.440 --> 2:48:06.040]  Without you, we wouldn't be here.
[2:48:06.040 --> 2:48:09.840]  Store-wide free shipping, 50% off all the supplements, a bunch of other big specials.
[2:48:09.840 --> 2:48:14.360]  But every hour, for only one hour, we should have been plugging this from the start of
[2:48:14.360 --> 2:48:15.860]  the hour.
[2:48:15.860 --> 2:48:19.320]  We have a product even bigger discount than 50% off.
[2:48:19.320 --> 2:48:22.680]  Brainforce Plus is our best-selling product.
[2:48:22.680 --> 2:48:25.160]  It isn't our most profitable because we hardly make any money on it.
[2:48:25.160 --> 2:48:27.260]  Comparable Super Neutropics are $60.
[2:48:27.260 --> 2:48:30.960]  We normally sell it for $40 at $19.95, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:48:30.960 --> 2:48:31.960]  It's a good deal.
[2:48:31.960 --> 2:48:38.880]  At $15.96, it is a loss leader when we give you the free shipping.
[2:48:38.880 --> 2:48:40.920]  But I want you to see how great this Neutropic is.
[2:48:40.920 --> 2:48:44.320]  It has 6,000 reviews, 4.6 stars, 92%.
[2:48:44.320 --> 2:48:45.840]  It is amazing.
[2:48:45.840 --> 2:48:48.520]  Neutropics Plus for clarity, focus, all of it.
[2:48:48.520 --> 2:48:49.520]  It's amazing.
[2:48:49.520 --> 2:48:54.040]  Now, a 20% more in each bottle, it's 60% off, and since I only plugged it at the end of
[2:48:54.040 --> 2:48:58.880]  the hour, we'll extend that for a couple hours, 60% off and store-wide free shipping.
[2:48:58.880 --> 2:49:04.000]  Double Patriot Points, meaning on your next order, you get 10% off, not 5% off, sign up
[2:49:04.000 --> 2:49:08.680]  for auto-ship on things like the Wake Up America coffee or the protein bars or the fish oil,
[2:49:08.680 --> 2:49:12.680]  things you want to reorder every 15 days, every month, every two months, canceling time,
[2:49:12.680 --> 2:49:15.960]  you get 10% off additionally.
[2:49:15.960 --> 2:49:18.760]  All right, going back to George Noray.
[2:49:18.760 --> 2:49:25.800]  We're getting a poll up, George, since you postulated it, of if this was the list of
[2:49:25.800 --> 2:49:29.680]  top contenders, and George Noray was on the list, who would you vote for?
[2:49:29.680 --> 2:49:34.520]  So we've got that infowars.com poll going up, and I guess we'll run that poll through
[2:49:34.520 --> 2:49:39.120]  the 50 hours, and we'll give you those results on Saturday.
[2:49:39.120 --> 2:49:42.720]  And I would imagine we'll probably get a couple hundred thousand votes.
[2:49:42.720 --> 2:49:47.920]  If those results come out positive, I want you to blitz that poll, Alex, to the mainstream
[2:49:47.920 --> 2:49:52.640]  media, and see if they pick that up, and see what they do, and see if they run with that.
[2:49:52.640 --> 2:49:58.800]  I want to see if there's a candidate that the American public could grasp without the
[2:49:58.800 --> 2:50:04.880]  political machine pushing them first, and see what happens, let's see what happens.
[2:50:04.880 --> 2:50:05.880]  I agree with you.
[2:50:05.880 --> 2:50:08.320]  Let me ask you this question.
[2:50:08.320 --> 2:50:13.160]  What would you do if you were President Trump, or if you were President, to counter big-tech
[2:50:13.160 --> 2:50:14.160]  censorship?
[2:50:14.160 --> 2:50:17.320]  I mean, a lot of Congress, their own internal videos admit they're doing it.
[2:50:17.320 --> 2:50:21.440]  It's getting worse by the minute.
[2:50:21.440 --> 2:50:27.800]  I would make sure that the one thing that we must avoid is hatred toward people.
[2:50:27.800 --> 2:50:30.240]  I don't care about criticism.
[2:50:30.240 --> 2:50:32.720]  I don't care about the ability for free speech.
[2:50:32.720 --> 2:50:34.640]  We should be entitled to that.
[2:50:34.640 --> 2:50:40.040]  What we need to stop in this country is this divide that we have right now, Alex, that
[2:50:40.040 --> 2:50:45.360]  I've never seen this bad before, where you can't even conduct dialogue with somebody.
[2:50:45.360 --> 2:50:50.880]  If you walked into a bar today, sat down to have a beer, and talk to the guy next to you,
[2:50:50.880 --> 2:50:54.880]  if he doesn't agree with your views, it's a screaming session.
[2:50:54.880 --> 2:50:56.280]  It's not a discussion.
[2:50:56.280 --> 2:50:57.560]  It's not a debate.
[2:50:57.560 --> 2:50:59.880]  It's not honest dialogue anymore.
[2:50:59.880 --> 2:51:02.320]  It's a screaming session.
[2:51:02.320 --> 2:51:08.240]  I get emails, I've got news guests on my show all the time, some are left, some are right.
[2:51:08.240 --> 2:51:14.920]  When I got a guy on who's more right-wing, Dr. John Curtis, online columnist.com, I'll
[2:51:14.920 --> 2:51:18.440]  get all kinds of hate email from people on the left.
[2:51:18.440 --> 2:51:24.880]  Then I'll have Howard Blumon, who's left, I get hate mail from those on the right.
[2:51:24.880 --> 2:51:26.800]  We got to fix this in this country.
[2:51:26.800 --> 2:51:32.760]  We got to get to a point where people can argue and debate and not scream and yell at
[2:51:32.760 --> 2:51:33.760]  people anymore.
[2:51:33.760 --> 2:51:34.760]  That's got to stop.
[2:51:34.760 --> 2:51:36.600]  Well, we're going to head down the wrong path.
[2:51:36.600 --> 2:51:39.440]  So what you're saying is people need to be tolerant, but let's just be honest.
[2:51:39.440 --> 2:51:42.760]  90% of the attacks are on the left against the right.
[2:51:42.760 --> 2:51:45.560]  People that are Trump supporters, the left are the ones driving the censorship.
[2:51:45.560 --> 2:51:46.760]  I know you're not left or right.
[2:51:46.760 --> 2:51:48.320]  You're more of a libertarian like I am.
[2:51:48.320 --> 2:51:51.240]  And I guess you'd probably run as a Democrat because that's obviously the video you could
[2:51:51.240 --> 2:51:52.240]  do that.
[2:51:52.240 --> 2:51:56.560]  Why don't Democrats have candidates like you that are more classic Americana A and then
[2:51:56.560 --> 2:51:57.560]  B?
[2:51:57.560 --> 2:52:04.400]  What would you do, though, as president separate from trying to say, hey, let's have a debate
[2:52:04.400 --> 2:52:05.400]  is okay.
[2:52:05.400 --> 2:52:09.560]  What would you do to stop these big tech companies and their monopolies?
[2:52:09.560 --> 2:52:12.560]  Oh, you'd get tough with them, absolutely.
[2:52:12.560 --> 2:52:16.880]  And more importantly, you get to know the CEOs.
[2:52:16.880 --> 2:52:19.800]  Jack Dorsey was from St. Louis, I'm from St. Louis.
[2:52:19.800 --> 2:52:22.560]  You get to know these people and say, what are you doing?
[2:52:22.560 --> 2:52:23.560]  Quit panicking.
[2:52:23.560 --> 2:52:27.560]  They are only reacting because they're panicking.
[2:52:27.560 --> 2:52:32.480]  Somebody is putting pressure on them to muffle Alex Jones.
[2:52:32.480 --> 2:52:35.400]  Somebody is putting pressure on them to pull websites.
[2:52:35.400 --> 2:52:37.600]  They're not doing this on their own.
[2:52:37.600 --> 2:52:41.480]  You've been around for a long, long time.
[2:52:41.480 --> 2:52:42.920]  You've been the same.
[2:52:42.920 --> 2:52:48.120]  You're not anymore or less vocal than you were 10, 15 years ago.
[2:52:48.120 --> 2:52:52.680]  Somebody's getting to these people, Alex, and scaring the living daylights out of them.
[2:52:52.680 --> 2:52:54.640]  And that's got to stop.
[2:52:54.640 --> 2:52:55.760]  Well, they are.
[2:52:55.760 --> 2:53:00.160]  They had every major news channel in the country, the television channel, Lester Holt
[2:53:00.160 --> 2:53:03.520]  let it say that I said get battle rifles and go kill the media.
[2:53:03.520 --> 2:53:04.680]  They didn't show a clip.
[2:53:04.680 --> 2:53:05.680]  They read quotes.
[2:53:05.680 --> 2:53:06.680]  You've never said that.
[2:53:06.680 --> 2:53:07.680]  Never.
[2:53:07.680 --> 2:53:08.680]  Never.
[2:53:08.680 --> 2:53:11.240]  I offered a million dollars.
[2:53:11.240 --> 2:53:14.200]  It was a 34 minute podcast or 38 minute podcast.
[2:53:14.200 --> 2:53:20.160]  I said, if Andy becomes your house, they dox ice and they dox Rand Paul and Tucker Carlson,
[2:53:20.160 --> 2:53:22.920]  you better have your battle rifle ready to defend yourself they attack you.
[2:53:22.920 --> 2:53:26.160]  And that turns into I say kill the media.
[2:53:26.160 --> 2:53:31.960]  When you've been on my show before, you cite actual stories that have happened that are
[2:53:31.960 --> 2:53:36.680]  in the media and then you react to it and then you comment on it.
[2:53:36.680 --> 2:53:43.520]  But never ever on my program have I heard you say anything to hurt anybody, to destroy
[2:53:43.520 --> 2:53:44.680]  somebody.
[2:53:44.680 --> 2:53:46.600]  You don't threaten violence.
[2:53:46.600 --> 2:53:53.280]  I don't get words coming from well, I'm colorful and they can take things out of context.
[2:53:53.280 --> 2:53:56.200]  I'm not let's say smooth like you a lot of times.
[2:53:56.200 --> 2:53:57.200]  And so I'm an easy target.
[2:53:57.200 --> 2:54:00.240]  I think that's really what comes down to not a politician.
[2:54:00.240 --> 2:54:01.240]  That's for sure.
[2:54:01.240 --> 2:54:05.880]  Well, how far do you think it's going to go now that they're getting down to trying
[2:54:05.880 --> 2:54:09.760]  but not trying or banning Jordan Peterson's book in New Zealand.
[2:54:09.760 --> 2:54:11.800]  They're banning zero hedges URL.
[2:54:11.800 --> 2:54:13.720]  They're calling for our URL to be banned.
[2:54:13.720 --> 2:54:16.440]  They're calling for Ben Shapiro to be banned off the internet.
[2:54:16.440 --> 2:54:22.560]  They're they're banning Trump's main social media person, you know, they off Facebook
[2:54:22.560 --> 2:54:23.560]  for no reason.
[2:54:23.560 --> 2:54:25.060]  I mean, it's out of control.
[2:54:25.060 --> 2:54:26.720]  And as you said, they've panicked.
[2:54:26.720 --> 2:54:31.920]  Don't they get that they're causing a bigger crisis than than that I think they're fighting?
[2:54:31.920 --> 2:54:32.920]  They will eventually.
[2:54:32.920 --> 2:54:34.560]  I think they'll have such an outcry.
[2:54:34.560 --> 2:54:37.040]  They're going to realize, oh my gosh, what have we done?
[2:54:37.040 --> 2:54:44.840]  But at this point right now, they're going with what they are thinking is the public's
[2:54:44.840 --> 2:54:47.960]  desire and they're reacting to it and they're wrong.
[2:54:47.960 --> 2:54:50.440]  They're making horrible mistakes.
[2:54:50.440 --> 2:54:55.360]  And again, the First Amendment under fire worse than I've ever seen it before.
[2:54:55.360 --> 2:54:58.200]  George, I know you've got a you're already up.
[2:54:58.200 --> 2:55:00.240]  You've got to get ready for your own show tonight.
[2:55:00.240 --> 2:55:07.960]  That's a midnight central 10 p.m. Pacific, I guess 1 a.m. New York time, I guess 11.
[2:55:07.960 --> 2:55:08.960]  Yes, sir.
[2:55:08.960 --> 2:55:09.960]  Yeah.
[2:55:09.960 --> 2:55:13.240]  So so so 11 at Night Mountain.
[2:55:13.240 --> 2:55:16.240]  What do you got coming up tonight because the mainstream media in the corporate system
[2:55:16.240 --> 2:55:21.240]  ignores talk radio, but talk radio is still gigantic and still has the biggest audiences.
[2:55:21.240 --> 2:55:25.640]  And I mean, they talk about somebody like Tucker Carlson, who's a great guy and a friend
[2:55:25.640 --> 2:55:27.720]  of mine with 4 million viewers a night.
[2:55:27.720 --> 2:55:31.240]  You've got 6, 7, 8 million viewers a night and you never hear about it corporate media
[2:55:31.240 --> 2:55:35.600]  because they're all I think really jealous of the power of the talk radio still has.
[2:55:35.600 --> 2:55:41.080]  Well, what we're doing and what we do on this program, Alex, since I took over from our
[2:55:41.080 --> 2:55:45.520]  bell back in 2003 is I've added current events to the show.
[2:55:45.520 --> 2:55:53.360]  I mean, before coast to coast was primarily paranormal ghosts, big foot UFOs.
[2:55:53.360 --> 2:55:58.120]  We still do all that that has not gone away and it's not going to go away, but we are
[2:55:58.120 --> 2:56:03.720]  doing current events now, alternative medicine, health issues, everything like that, and we're
[2:56:03.720 --> 2:56:04.720]  not going to stop.
[2:56:04.720 --> 2:56:10.040]  So we have a mix of everything that the world loves and our audience and our affiliate base
[2:56:10.040 --> 2:56:11.920]  continues to grow.
[2:56:11.920 --> 2:56:12.920]  That's right.
[2:56:12.920 --> 2:56:18.840]  Theater of the mind and while all other media is actually shrinking because it's all fractured
[2:56:18.840 --> 2:56:21.760]  when talk radio is done right, it's actually growing.
[2:56:21.760 --> 2:56:27.680]  And again, with all the censorship, talk radio is more important than ever.
[2:56:27.680 --> 2:56:31.520]  And I just want people to understand that it's there.
[2:56:31.520 --> 2:56:34.280]  And then you've also got a very wide internet platform.
[2:56:34.280 --> 2:56:36.120]  I know you're doing a lot of public speaking.
[2:56:36.120 --> 2:56:37.640]  I know you're also doing some TV shows.
[2:56:37.640 --> 2:56:39.720]  Tell us what else you're doing, George.
[2:56:39.720 --> 2:56:45.320]  Well, May 11th, I'll be live in Columbus, Ohio for anybody from your audience that lives
[2:56:45.320 --> 2:56:46.440]  out that way.
[2:56:46.440 --> 2:56:47.800]  Come to our live state show.
[2:56:47.800 --> 2:56:52.160]  You can get full information on the coast2coastam.com website.
[2:56:52.160 --> 2:56:57.640]  This coming Saturday, I'm in Everett, Washington, near Seattle for a live sold out show.
[2:56:57.640 --> 2:57:02.640]  I remember the one you and I did in Toronto, Alex, it was sold out.
[2:57:02.640 --> 2:57:07.680]  People went crazy when you came walking down the aisle with the spotlight on you.
[2:57:07.680 --> 2:57:13.520]  I think it's very important for talk hosts to see the public, to see their audience
[2:57:13.520 --> 2:57:16.760]  up front and personal, and that's what I keep doing around the country.
[2:57:16.760 --> 2:57:18.680]  I look forward to coming to another event soon.
[2:57:18.680 --> 2:57:20.160]  Say hi to the whole crew.
[2:57:20.160 --> 2:57:21.320]  And I'll say bye to you in the break.
[2:57:21.320 --> 2:57:22.520]  I'm going to host the fourth hour, folks.
[2:57:22.520 --> 2:57:23.520]  Stay with us.
[2:57:23.520 --> 2:57:26.760]  So they're having a studio problem at Hagman's operation, but that's okay.
[2:57:26.760 --> 2:57:28.960]  We're in the middle of the 50 hour broadcast.
[2:57:28.960 --> 2:57:30.680]  Only you can override the censors.
[2:57:30.680 --> 2:57:33.640]  Whatever local stations you're listening to, however you're watching on the internet or
[2:57:33.640 --> 2:57:37.920]  anything, spread those links via text message and email and word of mouth.
[2:57:37.920 --> 2:57:38.920]  You are awesome.
[2:57:38.920 --> 2:57:39.920]  And thank you all for making the broadcast possible.
[2:57:39.920 --> 2:57:42.320]  And thank George Norrie for all he's done for the broadcast as well.
[2:57:42.320 --> 2:57:45.240]  We'll be right back with hour number four.
[2:57:45.240 --> 2:57:47.280]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[2:57:47.280 --> 2:57:48.280]  Go ahead.
[2:57:48.280 --> 2:57:50.080]  Yeah, I just have to say something, man.
[2:57:50.080 --> 2:57:53.960]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[2:57:53.960 --> 2:57:54.960]  It just gets old, man.
[2:57:54.960 --> 2:57:57.120]  I'm going to shut you down right now.
[2:57:57.120 --> 2:57:58.120]  Okay.
[2:57:58.120 --> 2:58:00.160]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[2:58:00.160 --> 2:58:04.360]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[2:58:04.360 --> 2:58:06.880]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[2:58:06.880 --> 2:58:10.040]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[2:58:10.040 --> 2:58:12.600]  I mean, what's it going to take us being shut down?
[2:58:12.600 --> 2:58:13.600]  Is that what you want?
[2:58:13.600 --> 2:58:14.600]  Frank?
[2:58:14.600 --> 2:58:15.600]  You know what?
[2:58:15.600 --> 2:58:16.600]  I'll put it on pause again.
[2:58:16.600 --> 2:58:21.120]  Hey, Frank, do you understand it's not bragging to say we are the tip of the spear?
[2:58:21.120 --> 2:58:22.120]  We're under attack.
[2:58:22.120 --> 2:58:23.120]  We need your help.
[2:58:23.120 --> 2:58:27.400]  As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[2:58:27.400 --> 2:58:30.400]  I'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[2:58:30.400 --> 2:58:31.400]  Do you understand?
[2:58:31.400 --> 2:58:32.640]  I need your help, Frank.
[2:58:32.640 --> 2:58:34.920]  I need your help, Frank.
[2:58:34.920 --> 2:58:40.120]  Go to infowarstore.com right now and help fund the Info World.
[2:58:40.120 --> 2:58:41.240]  Do you understand?
[2:58:41.240 --> 2:58:42.920]  I need your help, Frank.
[2:58:42.920 --> 2:58:46.360]  Free press needs your help, Frank.
[2:58:46.360 --> 2:58:50.200]  Our grandparents, the great grandparents knew that they canned food during the fall, so
[2:58:50.200 --> 2:58:51.440]  they'd have it during the winter.
[2:58:51.440 --> 2:58:54.920]  And that's what I'm talking about at infowarstore.com.
[2:58:54.920 --> 2:59:01.080]  With infowarselect, it's the full spectrum of my patriots supply, one of the top most
[2:59:01.080 --> 2:59:02.400]  respected companies out there.
[2:59:02.400 --> 2:59:08.040]  But because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their
[2:59:08.040 --> 2:59:10.120]  other distributors aren't able to do.
[2:59:10.120 --> 2:59:14.400]  But I want to be a market leader, and I want you to have storeable food so it's a total
[2:59:14.400 --> 2:59:15.400]  win-win.
[2:59:15.400 --> 2:59:20.440]  We have those incredible sell prices back, infowarstore.com, on infowarselect, storeable
[2:59:20.440 --> 2:59:21.440]  foods.
[2:59:21.440 --> 2:59:25.560]  We've got special diet foods, they've got three-month supplies, your supplies, weak
[2:59:25.560 --> 2:59:29.560]  emergency supplies, they've got so many great products there, and you've got a three-year
[2:59:29.560 --> 2:59:30.560]  supply.
[2:59:30.560 --> 2:59:32.520]  If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[2:59:32.520 --> 2:59:35.080]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[2:59:35.080 --> 2:59:40.000]  You're buying war bonds, bringing great products, and together, with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[2:59:40.000 --> 2:59:49.440]  Infowarstore.com and infowarselect, high-quality storeable foods, powered by my patriots supply.
[2:59:49.440 --> 3:00:03.840]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:00:03.840 --> 3:00:09.840]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[3:00:09.840 --> 3:00:14.200]  All right, they booked so many great guests on this show, and then I open the phones up
[3:00:14.200 --> 3:00:17.800]  and I make a bunch of you hold, because we've got 20 phone lines, and I apologize.
[3:00:17.800 --> 3:00:22.120]  It's just the nature of the beast, Dave and Shelley, and Charity, and Jessica, and everybody.
[3:00:22.120 --> 3:00:23.800]  I'm going to go to you all, bam, bam, bam now.
[3:00:23.800 --> 3:00:25.800]  You've got my promise here in the fourth hour.
[3:00:25.800 --> 3:00:26.800]  Thanks for tuning in.
[3:00:26.800 --> 3:00:31.440]  It's a free world, and without you, we wouldn't be here.
[3:00:31.440 --> 3:00:33.240]  Without each other, none of us would be here.
[3:00:33.240 --> 3:00:36.560]  Dave and Shelley, I didn't see you were calling from Chile, or I would have gone to you earlier.
[3:00:36.560 --> 3:00:38.040]  Thanks for holding her on the ear.
[3:00:38.040 --> 3:00:39.040]  Welcome.
[3:00:39.040 --> 3:00:44.040]  Well, I'd like to say that this telephone call is brought to you by infowarstore.com.
[3:00:44.040 --> 3:00:55.920]  Anyway, apart from that, I got an email from the camera, well, the deputies, basically
[3:00:55.920 --> 3:01:01.160]  your representatives in Chile, and this is from the Communist Party, and it's talking
[3:01:01.160 --> 3:01:11.080]  about the meeting, not with Trump, but with Piñera and Bolsonaro from Brazil, and she
[3:01:11.080 --> 3:01:18.160]  starts off her email with, getting together today with Bolsonaro is like getting together
[3:01:18.160 --> 3:01:21.080]  with Hitler in 1936.
[3:01:21.080 --> 3:01:26.680]  I mean, it's just incredible what they talk about sometimes.
[3:01:26.680 --> 3:01:32.800]  I have no idea why this person seems to think that Jair Bolsonaro is like that.
[3:01:32.800 --> 3:01:35.680]  I mean, he seems to be a pretty straightforward guy.
[3:01:35.680 --> 3:01:44.600]  He's not a crazy guy, not telling gays that, no, you can't live, or anything like that.
[3:01:44.600 --> 3:01:45.600]  No, he's straight up-
[3:01:45.600 --> 3:01:49.440]  All Bolsonaro said is men shouldn't be peeing in each other's mouths in the middle of the
[3:01:49.440 --> 3:01:50.440]  street in front of children.
[3:01:50.440 --> 3:01:51.440]  Yeah.
[3:01:51.440 --> 3:01:54.880]  I mean, literally, because he said that he's a bad guy, and I had to talk about that on
[3:01:54.880 --> 3:01:56.960]  air, that's what's going on here.
[3:01:56.960 --> 3:02:01.040]  Look, they don't want leaders that care about the people that want prosperity.
[3:02:01.040 --> 3:02:06.000]  They want global corporations and follower leaders so they can suck the public dry.
[3:02:06.000 --> 3:02:09.840]  They want a bunch of broken people they can control, and once you see things from the
[3:02:09.840 --> 3:02:15.680]  cold-blooded psychotic perspective of these mega corporations, again, we're Bayer Pharmaceutical
[3:02:15.680 --> 3:02:17.440]  that bought Monsanto.
[3:02:17.440 --> 3:02:21.280]  It came out in the court documents, even NBC News had the documents back when they were
[3:02:21.280 --> 3:02:27.200]  somewhat decent 15 years ago, and said, there's too many hemophiliacs, so what if all the
[3:02:27.200 --> 3:02:31.240]  bloods contaminated with HIV, let them die.
[3:02:31.240 --> 3:02:36.840]  Now, the average person would be like, that's super evil and the empathy, and plus you have
[3:02:36.840 --> 3:02:38.720]  a conscience, which means you're connected to God.
[3:02:38.720 --> 3:02:40.800]  You're like, that'll come back on me.
[3:02:40.800 --> 3:02:42.760]  That's really bad mojo.
[3:02:42.760 --> 3:02:45.520]  But these people are cut off from God, they don't get it.
[3:02:45.520 --> 3:02:53.400]  So you can see the leader of Brazil with Trump, you can see he comes off as very real, got
[3:02:53.400 --> 3:02:57.160]  a good background, they almost killed him, he's still stuck with it.
[3:02:57.160 --> 3:03:00.160]  And you can see Brazil starting to turn around, but they're going to try to stop him.
[3:03:00.160 --> 3:03:03.760]  Oh, by the way, Bolsonaro's birthday is today.
[3:03:03.760 --> 3:03:06.600]  Well, happy birthday, President Bolsonaro.
[3:03:06.600 --> 3:03:07.600]  There you go.
[3:03:07.600 --> 3:03:12.320]  Anyway, that's all I've got to say, thanks pretty much for having me on, and go on to
[3:03:12.320 --> 3:03:13.320]  the next call.
[3:03:13.320 --> 3:03:14.320]  Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.
[3:03:14.320 --> 3:03:17.520]  All right, God bless you, Dave, thanks for putting up with me.
[3:03:17.520 --> 3:03:22.720]  You know, I've told the folks to take the calls, we don't really screen them.
[3:03:22.720 --> 3:03:27.360]  We should just like keep six phone lines and just cap it because then it is the frustration
[3:03:27.360 --> 3:03:31.040]  is what was it a few years ago?
[3:03:31.040 --> 3:03:37.320]  We had 24,000 phone calls in three hours.
[3:03:37.320 --> 3:03:42.320]  Now a lot of us people calling over and over again, but nobody's got and my memory doesn't
[3:03:42.320 --> 3:03:43.320]  perfect anymore.
[3:03:43.320 --> 3:03:46.600]  Well, somebody asked West, was it 23 or 26?
[3:03:46.600 --> 3:03:48.080]  What was the record number of phone calls?
[3:03:48.080 --> 3:03:56.320]  We have a digital system, 20, 26,000, 26,000 phone calls.
[3:03:56.320 --> 3:04:01.720]  And so I'm thinking I want to have a radio network.
[3:04:01.720 --> 3:04:07.960]  The shows I want are going to be clip shows where we play clips of interesting news for
[3:04:07.960 --> 3:04:13.000]  like an hour and then we take calls for an hour and really get to a bunch of them and
[3:04:13.000 --> 3:04:15.960]  then clips and then maybe a guest.
[3:04:15.960 --> 3:04:18.600]  And I'm working on getting the host, I'm working on getting the board ops and the producers
[3:04:18.600 --> 3:04:23.280]  and the crew in, but that's really going to be the model, but I have to lead by leadership
[3:04:23.280 --> 3:04:24.440]  by example.
[3:04:24.440 --> 3:04:29.480]  And I've got to just basically at the model of maybe we have one guest on and then we
[3:04:29.480 --> 3:04:33.320]  have an hour of calls and we have an hour of clips or something because it's just, it's
[3:04:33.320 --> 3:04:34.320]  just, it's just incredible.
[3:04:34.320 --> 3:04:41.480]  We're going to go to break and come right back with your calls charity, Jessica, Sean,
[3:04:41.480 --> 3:04:49.880]  Randy, Lukash, Jeff, Matthew, Lee, Dustin will go in the order your calls come in, please
[3:04:49.880 --> 3:04:50.880]  stay with us.
[3:04:50.880 --> 3:04:51.880]  God bless.
[3:04:51.880 --> 3:04:58.080]  I've got some really good news though, X2 is back.
[3:04:58.080 --> 3:05:04.960]  The original X2, Deep Earth Crystal, pure atomic iodine, what you want in FullWareStore.com.
[3:05:04.960 --> 3:05:09.720]  It'll be here in a week, manufactured in the US in FullWareStore.com with the best iodine
[3:05:09.720 --> 3:05:10.720]  in the world.
[3:05:10.720 --> 3:05:11.720]  X2, it's available.
[3:05:11.720 --> 3:05:12.840]  I thought X3 is great.
[3:05:12.840 --> 3:05:16.680]  We still got another Deep Earth Crystal source, but I thought add the other two types of iodine
[3:05:16.680 --> 3:05:18.200]  and the scientists that do that.
[3:05:18.200 --> 3:05:21.320]  It sold a lot that people want original X2.
[3:05:21.320 --> 3:05:25.200]  I was resigned the fact we didn't have X2, but it came through about a month ago.
[3:05:25.200 --> 3:05:29.320]  We now have X2 again and in FullWareStore.com, so hallelujah.
[3:05:29.320 --> 3:05:34.320]  It's been sold out for about almost three months, but we have now had the same company,
[3:05:34.320 --> 3:05:41.000]  the original X2, develop it again, and we were able to do the exact same formula.
[3:05:41.000 --> 3:05:46.120]  If you want to pre-order X2, the ultimate iodine out there, learn about the iodine conspiracy,
[3:05:46.120 --> 3:05:49.560]  learn about IQs dropping when you don't have it, learn about how the other iodines are
[3:05:49.560 --> 3:06:04.880]  and get yours today at FullWareStore.com or FullWareStore.com.
[3:06:04.880 --> 3:06:30.880]  It's been sold out for about a month and in FullWareStore.com and in FullWareStore.com
[3:06:30.880 --> 3:06:45.720]  and in FullWareStore.com.
[3:06:45.720 --> 3:07:08.560]  I've got a bunch of incredible clips and news to break down, but I'm taking your calls
[3:07:08.560 --> 3:07:09.560]  right now.
[3:07:09.560 --> 3:07:13.000]  At the bottom of the hour, I'll get to human admitting the Democrats have declared a secret
[3:07:13.000 --> 3:07:15.880]  national emergency, ooh, where'd you hear that?
[3:07:15.880 --> 3:07:20.760]  And I didn't just think that up, I've studied the U.S. Code, COG, and I don't think Trump
[3:07:20.760 --> 3:07:25.000]  understood it.
[3:07:25.000 --> 3:07:32.040]  And that's why they wanted to shut down more than anything was we were getting messages
[3:07:32.040 --> 3:07:37.240]  to Trump about the national emergency and he's declared the national emergency because
[3:07:37.240 --> 3:07:42.360]  you have to declare one to overwrite the last according to federal law.
[3:07:42.360 --> 3:07:43.720]  And that's why they're so pissed.
[3:07:43.720 --> 3:07:48.640]  Yeah, it has to do with the border and the wall, but that's only the vehicle for Trump
[3:07:48.640 --> 3:07:51.120]  to be able to fire whoever he wants.
[3:07:51.120 --> 3:07:55.200]  Like Ronald Reagan, when the air traffic controllers say, we're not going to let planes fly, says
[3:07:55.200 --> 3:07:58.400]  you're fired, if you don't.
[3:07:58.400 --> 3:08:06.400]  But by the way, I order you back to work under agreements you signed under national emergency
[3:08:06.400 --> 3:08:10.000]  or you're going to be criminally charged because you signed up to that, you're in a critical
[3:08:10.000 --> 3:08:15.200]  infrastructure, it's like saying you agree to be a paramedic, unless you got the flu
[3:08:15.200 --> 3:08:17.760]  or something and you're signed on, you're going to just not show up to work, people
[3:08:17.760 --> 3:08:22.640]  are going to, you know, dial the side of the road, you're like, that's authoritarianism.
[3:08:22.640 --> 3:08:26.880]  Well, airplanes crashing out of the skies authoritarianism too, isn't it?
[3:08:26.880 --> 3:08:30.160]  So we're not the ones that put all these emergencies in place, but we're trying to
[3:08:30.160 --> 3:08:31.160]  get rid of them.
[3:08:31.160 --> 3:08:35.280]  And you get rid of an emergency with an emergency because that's how the law is written.
[3:08:35.280 --> 3:08:41.000]  They tried to spin that all day that Oh, Jones is once martial law and tanks in the street.
[3:08:41.000 --> 3:08:43.960]  It's the Democrats want tanks in the street.
[3:08:43.960 --> 3:08:47.600]  Trump wants jobs in the street and I'm still a huge supporter of Trump, but we're not going
[3:08:47.600 --> 3:08:51.040]  to get him to move against the sensors without getting in his face.
[3:08:51.040 --> 3:08:53.200]  He doesn't respect anything else.
[3:08:53.200 --> 3:08:57.720]  And we've got a rampage through the advisors he's got trying to cover this up and we're
[3:08:57.720 --> 3:09:01.960]  already getting major success in his statements and what he's doing.
[3:09:01.960 --> 3:09:04.720]  And I got a bunch of clips I haven't got to on that front.
[3:09:04.720 --> 3:09:07.840]  The generals in Louisiana and other areas are getting ready to go after big tech.
[3:09:07.840 --> 3:09:14.360]  So it's on like they say, like Donkey Kong, a nice cheesy 80s statement, um, who's been
[3:09:14.360 --> 3:09:23.320]  holding the very longest, who's been holding the longest here, charity and Pennsylvania.
[3:09:23.320 --> 3:09:24.960]  Then we'll go to Jeff in Canada charity.
[3:09:24.960 --> 3:09:25.960]  Thanks for calling.
[3:09:25.960 --> 3:09:26.960]  Hi, Alex.
[3:09:26.960 --> 3:09:29.960]  Thank you for taking my call.
[3:09:29.960 --> 3:09:31.080]  Thank you.
[3:09:31.080 --> 3:09:36.720]  I was calling to discuss, um, and get your perspective on the church's role with the
[3:09:36.720 --> 3:09:37.720]  abortion issue.
[3:09:37.720 --> 3:09:43.400]  Now, I feel as though for so long, the issue has been sort of out of sight, out of mind
[3:09:43.400 --> 3:09:48.400]  with the churches, meaning there wasn't really an expose of all that we're going on in the
[3:09:48.400 --> 3:09:49.400]  abortion clinics.
[3:09:49.400 --> 3:09:55.600]  And now that we have all of these expose videos and the information coming out where they're
[3:09:55.600 --> 3:10:02.120]  blatantly admitting that they want to kill children, I feel like churches now need to
[3:10:02.120 --> 3:10:04.920]  take a stand when they have a voice.
[3:10:04.920 --> 3:10:07.080]  What are your perspective and on that?
[3:10:07.080 --> 3:10:11.600]  Well, charity, I'm glad you held for an hour and 31 minutes to say that because it's the
[3:10:11.600 --> 3:10:15.440]  most important thing said here in probably a year.
[3:10:15.440 --> 3:10:20.080]  And when I wake up at three a.m. and the spirit, you know, is with me and I'm in that quiet
[3:10:20.080 --> 3:10:25.320]  place, the most high that King David talked about, it's go on air and convict the churches
[3:10:25.320 --> 3:10:29.600]  and be calm and be focused and talk about their role.
[3:10:29.600 --> 3:10:30.600]  And that's what you're supposed to do.
[3:10:30.600 --> 3:10:37.000]  And I get, I get obsessed with news and information and worldly stuff that's important, but still
[3:10:37.000 --> 3:10:39.280]  not the spirit's key.
[3:10:39.280 --> 3:10:40.520]  It's a whole history, ma'am.
[3:10:40.520 --> 3:10:45.520]  And you know this, most churches aren't led by bad men and women, but they told them in
[3:10:45.520 --> 3:10:46.520]  the fifties.
[3:10:46.520 --> 3:10:51.680]  Oh, it's just a form you sign through the ecumenical movement that, oh, you're a charity
[3:10:51.680 --> 3:10:52.680]  now.
[3:10:52.680 --> 3:10:56.080]  And under the First Amendment, Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of
[3:10:56.080 --> 3:11:01.320]  religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or the right of the press or the right
[3:11:01.320 --> 3:11:04.280]  of the people to peacefully assemble for redress of grievances.
[3:11:04.280 --> 3:11:09.400]  People think of free speeches, government funding, you know, gay guys peeing on a crucifix
[3:11:09.400 --> 3:11:10.600]  for $100,000.
[3:11:10.600 --> 3:11:11.940]  That's blasphemy.
[3:11:11.940 --> 3:11:15.440]  First Amendment says Congress has no jurisdiction.
[3:11:15.440 --> 3:11:18.240]  Government has no jurisdiction over religion.
[3:11:18.240 --> 3:11:23.240]  That's how Hopi Indians can take peyote because Congress and government has no jurisdiction
[3:11:23.240 --> 3:11:24.240]  over it.
[3:11:24.240 --> 3:11:26.360]  Now, you may disagree with people taking peyote.
[3:11:26.360 --> 3:11:29.400]  The point is that's how powerful religious rights are.
[3:11:29.400 --> 3:11:34.800]  So they tricked the churches into becoming 501c3 charitable organizations and then they
[3:11:34.800 --> 3:11:38.480]  tell them you can't be political if you're under this.
[3:11:38.480 --> 3:11:41.960]  So I go to these big mega churches and some of them are real nice and they're uplifting
[3:11:41.960 --> 3:11:46.200]  and it's positive and it's more of like a, you know, upbeat deal.
[3:11:46.200 --> 3:11:51.240]  As far as you go, it's all leftist and middle on the gates of propaganda, but they believe
[3:11:51.240 --> 3:11:58.040]  that we're going to turn people off to Christ if we don't give them a soft cotton candy existence.
[3:11:58.040 --> 3:12:00.360]  Well, we've lost the country with that.
[3:12:00.360 --> 3:12:04.160]  And so you go and I can meet these preachers for dinner privately.
[3:12:04.160 --> 3:12:05.600]  They know all the stuff that's going on.
[3:12:05.600 --> 3:12:06.760]  They're tough guys.
[3:12:06.760 --> 3:12:07.920]  They're good looking veterans.
[3:12:07.920 --> 3:12:09.160]  They're everything.
[3:12:09.160 --> 3:12:13.400]  But at the end of the day, they don't have the leadership because they think they've got
[3:12:13.400 --> 3:12:19.240]  big jumbo TVs and, you know, celebrity guests coming in to talk and it's all about how big
[3:12:19.240 --> 3:12:20.760]  the mega church is.
[3:12:20.760 --> 3:12:25.320]  When if you have churches that really get in there and talk about the devil and the
[3:12:25.320 --> 3:12:29.080]  attack on the family and the system, people are ready to take action.
[3:12:29.080 --> 3:12:30.520]  They're ready to get serious.
[3:12:30.520 --> 3:12:31.960]  They're ready for the church to lead us out of this.
[3:12:31.960 --> 3:12:33.920]  So these aren't churches.
[3:12:33.920 --> 3:12:36.920]  These are Oprah Winfrey secret centers.
[3:12:36.920 --> 3:12:39.480]  She's running a big church in Africa right now, by the way, putting her money in it.
[3:12:39.480 --> 3:12:42.680]  So it's tax free where they just sit there make everybody feel good.
[3:12:42.680 --> 3:12:43.680]  Yeah.
[3:12:43.680 --> 3:12:44.680]  Where are the churches?
[3:12:44.680 --> 3:12:46.280]  Well, they say talk about abortion.
[3:12:46.280 --> 3:12:47.280]  It's political.
[3:12:47.280 --> 3:12:52.120]  But then all the other leftist churches are saying vote for AOC and vote for Pocahontas
[3:12:52.120 --> 3:12:54.760]  and Beto or Rourke.
[3:12:54.760 --> 3:12:57.320]  So those aren't churches.
[3:12:57.320 --> 3:12:58.320]  They are.
[3:12:58.320 --> 3:13:01.600]  Why did Christ not go preach at the synagogues?
[3:13:01.600 --> 3:13:04.360]  He said that's a bunch of Pharisees how they're all high and mighty.
[3:13:04.360 --> 3:13:06.600]  They're just making money off tithes.
[3:13:06.600 --> 3:13:08.160]  He beat them with whips.
[3:13:08.160 --> 3:13:14.680]  He was hanging out with prostitutes and tax collectors and fishermen and, you know, cobblers
[3:13:14.680 --> 3:13:19.280]  and people that made, you know, cabinets because they were real people and they listened.
[3:13:19.280 --> 3:13:24.000]  They weren't in religion to be powerful and to spew guilt.
[3:13:24.000 --> 3:13:27.480]  And so Christ, who was perfect, was going to the imperfect because at least they had
[3:13:27.480 --> 3:13:28.480]  soft hearts.
[3:13:28.480 --> 3:13:32.720]  They weren't the Pharisees praying up on a hilltop so everybody could see the Pharisee
[3:13:32.720 --> 3:13:36.560]  and Sadducee with all their law and all their legalese and their cult.
[3:13:36.560 --> 3:13:41.080]  He was looking for people that were really lost, not people that were posing.
[3:13:41.080 --> 3:13:43.400]  And so we should.
[3:13:43.400 --> 3:13:47.320]  You should try to get up in front of your church and bring up the governor saying we
[3:13:47.320 --> 3:13:51.560]  kill babies after they're born and get into bioethics and how they're doing it.
[3:13:51.560 --> 3:13:56.560]  You know, you should, your husband, whoever, or start your own church, whatever, start
[3:13:56.560 --> 3:13:59.800]  your own website because we have to come out of Babylon.
[3:13:59.800 --> 3:14:02.800]  That doesn't mean I'm perfect or, you know, doesn't mean I don't drink a beer.
[3:14:02.800 --> 3:14:04.680]  I mean, I don't eat too much or whatever.
[3:14:04.680 --> 3:14:08.320]  The point is, is that I still love God and love children and you judge a tree by its
[3:14:08.320 --> 3:14:09.320]  fruits.
[3:14:09.320 --> 3:14:13.200]  And if you're not standing up for unborn children and now born children, and if you're
[3:14:13.200 --> 3:14:17.880]  not standing up against devil worship being taught to children, and if you're not standing
[3:14:17.880 --> 3:14:23.000]  up against world government and open evil, then you know that you're not on the right
[3:14:23.000 --> 3:14:24.240]  path and you're not with God.
[3:14:24.240 --> 3:14:27.160]  And God's going to say to these church leaders, I don't know you.
[3:14:27.160 --> 3:14:31.480]  Just go away from me because they're not putting the skin in the game.
[3:14:31.480 --> 3:14:34.760]  They're trying to create, oh, the whole world's going to end anyways.
[3:14:34.760 --> 3:14:37.520]  This is a modern ecumenical thing of the last hundred years.
[3:14:37.520 --> 3:14:42.320]  So let's just get people in here so they're not in the world so that, you know, we save
[3:14:42.320 --> 3:14:43.320]  them.
[3:14:43.320 --> 3:14:46.600]  No, you just brought the world into the church, so they're not going to recognize the difference
[3:14:46.600 --> 3:14:50.940]  between the world and the church and the God's spirit isn't going to be in that church.
[3:14:50.940 --> 3:14:54.440]  It's going to be a bunch of feel good, synthetic garbage.
[3:14:54.440 --> 3:14:57.000]  And so we're going to lose all these people because of it.
[3:14:57.000 --> 3:14:58.000]  And it's the devil's plan.
[3:14:58.000 --> 3:15:00.600]  What do you think of that answer?
[3:15:00.600 --> 3:15:03.640]  I agree with you a hundred percent.
[3:15:03.640 --> 3:15:08.480]  A friend once told me, and I've often say that the purpose of the church is to build
[3:15:08.480 --> 3:15:10.200]  Christ's kingdom, not our kingdom.
[3:15:10.200 --> 3:15:16.240]  And I feel like so many people, and I'm not trying to bash the church, it is good.
[3:15:16.240 --> 3:15:18.520]  But I feel that they've gotten caught up.
[3:15:18.520 --> 3:15:23.200]  They're so concerned about building their programs when now we have a clear line that's
[3:15:23.200 --> 3:15:28.480]  been drawn where people are saying, no, we want to kill children, you know, bull turn.
[3:15:28.480 --> 3:15:30.720]  They don't want to charity.
[3:15:30.720 --> 3:15:31.720]  They're doing it.
[3:15:31.720 --> 3:15:32.720]  Right.
[3:15:32.720 --> 3:15:33.720]  Exactly.
[3:15:33.720 --> 3:15:40.480]  And now they're having programs where they want to defile and ruin small children.
[3:15:40.480 --> 3:15:42.880]  They want to completely destroy.
[3:15:42.880 --> 3:15:43.880]  Exactly.
[3:15:43.880 --> 3:15:45.960]  Evil has come out of its burrows like a plague.
[3:15:45.960 --> 3:15:48.680]  Where is the spirit of the Lord to lift the standard against it?
[3:15:48.680 --> 3:15:52.200]  If the churches don't lift the standard now, they're of the devil.
[3:15:52.200 --> 3:15:58.080]  Hunters, anglers, campers and survivalists, get back to nature and expand your horizons

[3:16:51.960 --> 3:16:54.200]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[3:16:54.200 --> 3:16:58.120]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[3:16:58.120 --> 3:16:59.680]  I sued the IRS in one.
[3:16:59.680 --> 3:17:02.640]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[3:17:02.640 --> 3:17:05.920]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with
[3:17:05.920 --> 3:17:08.160]  tax problems they thought might never be solved.

[3:19:22.520 --> 3:19:27.520]  the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy

[3:20:14.880 --> 3:20:29.120]  The great Dwight Yochum bringing us in, I'm going to go right back to your phone calls,
[3:20:29.120 --> 3:20:31.720]  but let me just recap what I was saying earlier.
[3:20:31.720 --> 3:20:33.720]  I'm not perfect, I'm not judging anybody.
[3:20:33.720 --> 3:20:37.720]  If you love God and you love justice, you're still going to do some bad things for all
[3:20:37.720 --> 3:20:38.720]  sinners.
[3:20:38.720 --> 3:20:44.360]  But these modern churches have signed contracts with the devil, 501c3 since the 50s.
[3:20:44.360 --> 3:20:48.800]  And churches are under the First Amendment, they shouldn't be under that system.
[3:20:48.800 --> 3:20:50.320]  They got tricked to be under it.
[3:20:50.320 --> 3:20:52.720]  There's a lot of good churches that are still 501c3.
[3:20:52.720 --> 3:20:55.600]  God judges the spirit and you know the heart.
[3:20:55.600 --> 3:20:59.280]  But if you ask what's going on, you go to a big church, you feel the spirit of God because
[3:20:59.280 --> 3:21:02.120]  there's good people there.
[3:21:02.120 --> 3:21:06.120]  But when the preachers are up there, got you in a holding pattern so that you never go
[3:21:06.120 --> 3:21:11.640]  out on the streets and do anything, it's not good.
[3:21:11.640 --> 3:21:16.200]  Or they'll send the young people out to hand out stuff about the church and proselytize.
[3:21:16.200 --> 3:21:19.280]  And it's more like, I look at the men at these mega, they're more like cheerleaders, they're
[3:21:19.280 --> 3:21:22.440]  like jumping up and down, it's more like a football game.
[3:21:22.440 --> 3:21:24.840]  And this hit the football game.
[3:21:24.840 --> 3:21:27.920]  You think they'd be aborting babies after they're born?
[3:21:27.920 --> 3:21:33.240]  All over the country and passing laws would do it if the churches weren't captured.
[3:21:33.240 --> 3:21:36.560]  So that's where I stand.
[3:21:36.560 --> 3:21:43.280]  And again, it's not about me up here on some high horse that I'm this big moral guy and
[3:21:43.280 --> 3:21:46.400]  that's why I stand up for babies not getting killed.
[3:21:46.400 --> 3:21:48.200]  That's dangerous, folks.
[3:21:48.200 --> 3:21:51.680]  You think the rest of us are going to be safe if they can kill kids after they're born?
[3:21:51.680 --> 3:21:52.680]  What about old people?
[3:21:52.680 --> 3:21:53.680]  They're already killing them now.
[3:21:53.680 --> 3:21:55.680]  Look all over the world, they got euthanasia.
[3:21:55.680 --> 3:21:58.480]  By the way, that's different than if you've got terminal cancer and you don't want treatment
[3:21:58.480 --> 3:22:02.360]  or you want a bunch of heroin, get you out of it quicker.
[3:22:02.360 --> 3:22:04.920]  I'm not judging people.
[3:22:04.920 --> 3:22:07.120]  But see, how about the state killing you?
[3:22:07.120 --> 3:22:09.680]  And I'm not saying suicide's good either.
[3:22:09.680 --> 3:22:12.080]  It's just that I understand somebody that wants to get out of their misery.
[3:22:12.080 --> 3:22:14.080]  I don't judge them.
[3:22:14.080 --> 3:22:17.520]  Back when I was a teenager and stuff, I was totally, I guess, assisted suicide because
[3:22:17.520 --> 3:22:19.000]  I knew the state would get involved.
[3:22:19.000 --> 3:22:23.720]  But then as I grew up and got older, I realized the state wants assisted suicide because they
[3:22:23.720 --> 3:22:26.520]  want to kill you and get your money.
[3:22:26.520 --> 3:22:28.200]  They do that definitely in Northern Europe.
[3:22:28.200 --> 3:22:33.480]  But then I had a lot of friends I know, quite a few friends, veterans and doctors and family
[3:22:33.480 --> 3:22:36.840]  friends that, you know, they'd get kidney cancer or they'd get liver cancer or they'd
[3:22:36.840 --> 3:22:40.160]  get bone cancer and man, it'd be hurting real bad and they didn't want to spend all their
[3:22:40.160 --> 3:22:41.160]  families money.
[3:22:41.160 --> 3:22:45.160]  They'd just shove a 45 in their mouth and blow their brains all over the wall.
[3:22:45.160 --> 3:22:48.600]  And you can't not say they're not being wimps.
[3:22:48.600 --> 3:22:51.240]  They're keeping their family from the expenses.
[3:22:51.240 --> 3:22:53.040]  So and I'm not saying do that either.
[3:22:53.040 --> 3:22:57.600]  I'm just saying the Lord works in mysterious ways.
[3:22:57.600 --> 3:22:59.440]  And I'm not going to judge people that have had abortions.
[3:22:59.440 --> 3:23:01.120]  You got lied into it.
[3:23:01.120 --> 3:23:02.680]  It was the wrong thing to do.
[3:23:02.680 --> 3:23:06.480]  But as long as you say it's wrong and repent, God loves you.
[3:23:06.480 --> 3:23:10.240]  But if you turn it into a sacrament and love it, then God hates you.
[3:23:10.240 --> 3:23:14.320]  And I'm not going to judge anybody I've known because I've had a lot of people I love and
[3:23:14.320 --> 3:23:16.040]  care about to kill themselves.
[3:23:16.040 --> 3:23:18.400]  I'll never intend to kill myself.
[3:23:18.400 --> 3:23:22.040]  I tend to go on as long as I can, but I never want to kill myself.
[3:23:22.040 --> 3:23:25.400]  I never have those desires, but I've known a lot of good people who were in a lot of
[3:23:25.400 --> 3:23:28.520]  pain, killed themselves a lot.
[3:23:28.520 --> 3:23:35.360]  And you can't blame somebody wanting to get out of pain.
[3:23:35.360 --> 3:23:40.960]  And the reason I'm going down that road is God judges the heart.
[3:23:40.960 --> 3:23:44.680]  And the devil knows how to manipulate us and go, oh, look, you did this or you did that.
[3:23:44.680 --> 3:23:45.680]  You're not perfect.
[3:23:45.680 --> 3:23:46.680]  So don't tell me.
[3:23:46.680 --> 3:23:48.240]  Well, here's the deal.
[3:23:48.240 --> 3:23:51.200]  We're not perfect, but we don't want to kill babies after they're born or before they're
[3:23:51.200 --> 3:23:52.200]  born.
[3:23:52.200 --> 3:23:53.520]  And we know the larger agenda.
[3:23:53.520 --> 3:23:54.520]  That's all I'm getting at here.
[3:23:54.520 --> 3:23:55.520]  That's all I'm getting at.
[3:23:55.520 --> 3:23:56.520]  Let's go back to the calls.
[3:23:56.520 --> 3:24:14.720]  I've been to so many churches, so many churches, and they're just feel good institutions.
[3:24:14.720 --> 3:24:19.600]  And you go to these big churches in Texas, and it's all about how great Texas is.
[3:24:19.600 --> 3:24:22.520]  And they'll have some football player come in and talk.
[3:24:22.520 --> 3:24:25.800]  Everybody's like, oh, look, that's the quarterback from whatever.
[3:24:25.800 --> 3:24:26.800]  And that's great.
[3:24:26.800 --> 3:24:28.640]  I guess to make people's identity God.
[3:24:28.640 --> 3:24:32.160]  So you show them a bunch of famous people to think that's God's identity.
[3:24:32.160 --> 3:24:40.640]  God's identity is building things and founding things and doing things and paying for something.
[3:24:40.640 --> 3:24:44.480]  Christ is the ultimate example of that and all the prophets human, let me tell you something.
[3:24:44.480 --> 3:24:45.480]  Nothing worth anything's free.
[3:24:45.480 --> 3:24:47.760]  Everybody knows it.
[3:24:47.760 --> 3:24:53.800]  And if you think we're going to get taken to heaven on a bed of roses or on a bed of
[3:24:53.800 --> 3:24:56.040]  feathers, God doesn't think coming.
[3:24:56.040 --> 3:24:59.200]  It's going to take blood, it's going to take sweat, it's going to take tears.
[3:24:59.200 --> 3:25:02.720]  But let me tell you something, through the blood, sweat and tears, you're going to find
[3:25:02.720 --> 3:25:03.720]  ecstasy.
[3:25:03.720 --> 3:25:10.280]  And it's not that you're even into pain, it's that you're into overcoming the enemy's will.
[3:25:10.280 --> 3:25:15.400]  And the more you stand against the enemy and spread your sales interdimensionally for God,
[3:25:15.400 --> 3:25:19.160]  the more God blows life into you.
[3:25:19.160 --> 3:25:23.480]  Like Genesis says, through God's nostrils, breathe life into the planet, you can literally
[3:25:23.480 --> 3:25:29.920]  feel God's spirit like a wind, just and right when the enemy hits, you're like, this is
[3:25:29.920 --> 3:25:30.920]  not fun.
[3:25:30.920 --> 3:25:35.040]  All of a sudden you feel God back you up and it's like, whoa.
[3:25:35.040 --> 3:25:39.200]  And the worse the enemy gets, the more you can see Satan, the more you can see God.
[3:25:39.200 --> 3:25:42.400]  The more you feel the enemy, the more you see how fallen they are, the more you think
[3:25:42.400 --> 3:25:45.520]  God, you know God's real and God's right there with you.
[3:25:45.520 --> 3:25:48.880]  And you think about people who never had the experience of being close to God and how horrible
[3:25:48.880 --> 3:25:50.680]  that must be to be cut off from God.
[3:25:50.680 --> 3:25:55.320]  All right, I'm sorry, I'm ranting, I'm being a bad person who does save us up next year
[3:25:55.320 --> 3:26:01.920]  is no longer August.
[3:26:01.920 --> 3:26:05.920]  Jeff in Canada, and then we'll go to Lucas and Randy and everybody else, go ahead.
[3:26:05.920 --> 3:26:09.040]  Yeah, Alex, fantastic show today.
[3:26:09.040 --> 3:26:11.800]  Really appreciate you highlighting the abortion issue.
[3:26:11.800 --> 3:26:14.160]  It's the critical issue of our time.
[3:26:14.160 --> 3:26:19.680]  It's not, you know, the it's the issue of humankind and the devil wants our children
[3:26:19.680 --> 3:26:20.680]  to die.
[3:26:20.680 --> 3:26:21.680]  Exactly.
[3:26:21.680 --> 3:26:25.880]  If we turn away from this, what else can we turn away from except faith in God?
[3:26:25.880 --> 3:26:31.000]  So I just want to answer what this lady or give a suggestion with this lady, this last
[3:26:31.000 --> 3:26:37.200]  lady who called was talking about what practically can we do as Christians and what do you do
[3:26:37.200 --> 3:26:38.200]  in these churches?
[3:26:38.200 --> 3:26:41.600]  I mean, you go to them and the preacher is perfectly dressed and everything's really
[3:26:41.600 --> 3:26:42.600]  great.
[3:26:42.600 --> 3:26:44.360]  He says a bunch of good stuff, but it's all synthetic.
[3:26:44.360 --> 3:26:46.440]  There's no fighting the enemy.
[3:26:46.440 --> 3:26:48.240]  We're all hiding in the churches.
[3:26:48.240 --> 3:26:54.200]  Yeah, it's picking out these miniscule things and just forgetting about the main issues
[3:26:54.200 --> 3:26:55.680]  of our day.
[3:26:55.680 --> 3:27:01.400]  And anyway, I just wanted to put it out there to really simplify the argument and to really
[3:27:01.400 --> 3:27:07.360]  expose the hypocrisy and the pinnacle of irony of pro-abortion people.
[3:27:07.360 --> 3:27:10.760]  Look him in the eye, eyeball to eyeball and ask him one question.
[3:27:10.760 --> 3:27:13.760]  Do you wish you would have been aborted?
[3:27:13.760 --> 3:27:15.520]  And just let him stew on that.
[3:27:15.520 --> 3:27:20.120]  Let him squirm and let him answer that to you because 99% of them are going to say,
[3:27:20.120 --> 3:27:23.000]  you know, I want to live.
[3:27:23.000 --> 3:27:29.120]  And if you can't extend that whole life decision that you received to somebody else, you're
[3:27:29.120 --> 3:27:30.120]  a complete hypocrite.
[3:27:30.120 --> 3:27:31.120]  Exactly.
[3:27:31.120 --> 3:27:32.680]  And you hit the secret of it all.
[3:27:32.680 --> 3:27:36.800]  The left wants you to be a victim and always downtrodden, but most of the really cool,
[3:27:36.800 --> 3:27:42.280]  amazing people, whether it was George Washington and Carver or whether it was, I mean, you
[3:27:42.280 --> 3:27:49.560]  can name it, they all went through incredible people like Benjamin Franklin, people like,
[3:27:49.560 --> 3:27:54.880]  I mean, nobody went through the kind of stuff that became as famous as he did as somebody
[3:27:54.880 --> 3:27:56.520]  like Andrew Jackson.
[3:27:56.520 --> 3:28:00.080]  They didn't take what bad, what happened to them and make it their weakness.
[3:28:00.080 --> 3:28:01.680]  They made it their strength.
[3:28:01.680 --> 3:28:07.200]  And so so many of the people that are in wheelchairs or that have have diseases that would be aborted
[3:28:07.200 --> 3:28:08.200]  because of their genetics.
[3:28:08.200 --> 3:28:09.360]  That's where this is all going.
[3:28:09.360 --> 3:28:11.120]  There are best people.
[3:28:11.120 --> 3:28:14.440]  And so these adversities are not plagues.
[3:28:14.440 --> 3:28:17.880]  Many of these adversities, if we overcome them, are our strengths.
[3:28:17.880 --> 3:28:19.680]  Exactly.
[3:28:19.680 --> 3:28:23.840]  And I think what we need to do is put a camera in front of these people's faces and ask them
[3:28:23.840 --> 3:28:24.840]  the question.
[3:28:24.840 --> 3:28:28.080]  Beto, would have you wanted to be aborted when you were a child?
[3:28:28.080 --> 3:28:29.080]  It's a genius.
[3:28:29.080 --> 3:28:30.080]  I'm going to do it.
[3:28:30.080 --> 3:28:31.760]  I want everyone go out, go to Beto.
[3:28:31.760 --> 3:28:33.000]  A Millie Weaver's on fire.
[3:28:33.000 --> 3:28:34.000]  We'll send her.
[3:28:34.000 --> 3:28:35.000]  Caitlin Bennett.
[3:28:35.000 --> 3:28:36.000]  Go ask Beto.
[3:28:36.000 --> 3:28:37.840]  Do you wish your mother would have aborted you?
[3:28:37.840 --> 3:28:38.840]  Total genius.
[3:28:38.840 --> 3:28:41.720]  Thanks for holding an hour and a half, Jeff, to say that we salute you.
[3:28:41.720 --> 3:28:44.560]  Coming up next, I'm going to rampage through these calls.
[3:28:44.560 --> 3:28:49.680]  Jessica and Locus and Sean.
[3:28:49.680 --> 3:28:50.680]  Everybody's been holding the line.
[3:28:50.680 --> 3:28:53.400]  We'll get to everybody straight ahead.
[3:28:53.400 --> 3:28:57.120]  Pain in my neck, back and shoulders has really gotten worse.
[3:28:57.120 --> 3:29:00.200]  Relief for body pain is here with Sunny Bay Heating Pads.
[3:29:00.200 --> 3:29:02.520]  Well, the last thing I want is to take another pill.

[3:29:59.600 --> 3:30:01.840]  you are changing the world.
[3:30:01.840 --> 3:30:05.560]  It's you that has defeated Hillary and the Globalist.
[3:30:05.560 --> 3:30:10.120]  It is you, the InfoWars, across the planet that stood against the bullying, that stood

[3:30:18.880 --> 3:30:19.880]  You are the InfoWars.
[3:30:19.880 --> 3:30:24.960]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever that everyone
[3:30:24.960 --> 3:30:30.080]  go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the
[3:30:30.080 --> 3:30:35.920]  censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[3:30:35.920 --> 3:30:41.480]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the InfoWars.com articles, to share the videos,
[3:30:41.480 --> 3:30:43.880]  to tell people by the local stations you're listening to.
[3:30:43.880 --> 3:30:49.320]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at InfoWars.com forward
[3:30:49.320 --> 3:30:50.960]  slash newsletter.

[3:31:53.800 --> 3:31:57.880]  The globalist, the eugenicist are always talking down to us.
[3:31:57.880 --> 3:32:02.680]  They're always trying to make us feel small, to feel insignificant.
[3:32:02.680 --> 3:32:07.000]  They try to censor because they fear you and don't want you to have the right to access
[3:32:07.000 --> 3:32:10.600]  information so you can make your own decisions.
[3:32:10.600 --> 3:32:15.480]  They want you to believe you're powerless, but the truth is, it is we the people and
[3:32:15.480 --> 3:32:21.720]  our ideas and our actions and what we say and what we do that changes the world.
[3:32:21.720 --> 3:32:23.760]  We are the power structure.
[3:32:23.760 --> 3:32:25.360]  We are the inventors.
[3:32:25.360 --> 3:32:32.680]  We are the trailblazers and the globalists understand that and they understand that they
[3:32:32.680 --> 3:32:37.640]  are basically trying to control and steal the future from we the people.
[3:32:37.640 --> 3:32:42.360]  Now to help fund our operation that is undoubtedly the very tip of the spear against these globalists,
[3:32:42.360 --> 3:32:46.600]  I want to encourage listeners and viewers to understand that throughout the second half
[3:32:46.600 --> 3:32:51.640]  of the month of March, we're going to have store-wide free shipping and 50% off infowarstore.com,
[3:32:51.640 --> 3:32:56.840]  something everybody should take advantage of.
[3:32:56.840 --> 3:33:14.600]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:14.600 --> 3:33:44.440]  It's Alex Jones.
[3:33:44.440 --> 3:34:04.280]  I want to explain this, we're going to go to your calls, it is not heroic to stand
[3:34:04.280 --> 3:34:10.320]  up and speak out and say the convicted pedophiles should not be at public schools and elementary
[3:34:10.320 --> 3:34:18.600]  schools and toddler events telling kids to touch their butts and their faces and admittedly
[3:34:18.600 --> 3:34:20.640]  trying to corrupt them in their own admissions.
[3:34:20.640 --> 3:34:24.840]  It's not heroic to say we shouldn't kill babies after they're born.
[3:34:24.840 --> 3:34:30.040]  It's not heroic to say we shouldn't kill grandma.
[3:34:30.040 --> 3:34:33.720]  It's not heroic to say to these leftists who go up in city council meetings and say we're
[3:34:33.720 --> 3:34:36.200]  going to groom your kids, they belong to us.
[3:34:36.200 --> 3:34:38.880]  It's coming up for air.
[3:34:38.880 --> 3:34:40.880]  It's just living in the real world.
[3:34:40.880 --> 3:34:43.000]  This is unbelievable.
[3:34:43.000 --> 3:34:48.200]  We're going to your phone calls right now and let's go to Lucas in North Carolina.
[3:34:48.200 --> 3:34:49.880]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[3:34:49.880 --> 3:34:51.880]  How you doing Alex?
[3:34:51.880 --> 3:34:52.880]  Good beyond.
[3:34:52.880 --> 3:34:53.880]  Good to have you here.
[3:34:53.880 --> 3:34:57.280]  I rarely get a chance to listen to you live.
[3:34:57.280 --> 3:34:59.800]  I used to listen to you on YouTube.
[3:34:59.800 --> 3:35:02.240]  I like to listen to various claims of the day.
[3:35:02.240 --> 3:35:07.960]  Obviously, I've been banned off there and I downloaded the info wars app for Android.
[3:35:07.960 --> 3:35:14.280]  If other people want to listen at various times of the day, that's the way to go.
[3:35:14.280 --> 3:35:18.640]  Real quickly, before I get to my point, I just wanted to say that I am a user of the
[3:35:18.640 --> 3:35:20.640]  info wars products.
[3:35:20.640 --> 3:35:25.000]  First, I started with super mail vitality.
[3:35:25.000 --> 3:35:30.120]  I am a late 30s mail and I don't get all the time that I would like to work out as
[3:35:30.120 --> 3:35:36.760]  much as I do and immediately noticed being able to retain strength and muscle mass from
[3:35:36.760 --> 3:35:39.520]  the use of super mail vitality.
[3:35:39.520 --> 3:35:41.440]  So I want to thank you for that.
[3:35:41.440 --> 3:35:48.240]  And next, I tried X2 and it's nothing that you notice immediately, but it's seen over
[3:35:48.240 --> 3:35:49.240]  time.
[3:35:49.240 --> 3:35:55.320]  I felt like I was more sharp from the iodine being able to retain short term memory better.
[3:35:55.320 --> 3:36:01.920]  I just feel a little sharper in my day to day activities.
[3:36:01.920 --> 3:36:06.120]  I totally agree with you and it's the good halogen.
[3:36:06.120 --> 3:36:12.360]  IQs get reduced by 15 points without iodine in your development.
[3:36:12.360 --> 3:36:15.160]  People can look this up for themselves and that's why the globalists are obsessed with
[3:36:15.160 --> 3:36:18.520]  making sure it's not in the food, it's not in the products.
[3:36:18.520 --> 3:36:22.400]  We are just starving for iodine and that's why we came out with X2, we have X3 that's
[3:36:22.400 --> 3:36:24.800]  all three types but this is the deep earth crystal source.
[3:36:24.800 --> 3:36:28.280]  We don't have it back in stock and I haven't even plugged this out since you mentioned
[3:36:28.280 --> 3:36:29.280]  it.
[3:36:29.280 --> 3:36:33.120]  We've got a bunch of specials, 50% off running right now, store wide free shipping but we
[3:36:33.120 --> 3:36:37.600]  have 60% off brain force plus that's the special running right now.
[3:36:37.600 --> 3:36:38.600]  Sorry, go ahead.
[3:36:38.600 --> 3:36:39.600]  Oh, that's fine.
[3:36:39.600 --> 3:36:43.760]  That's precisely why I mentioned it because I'm listening to the app last night and you
[3:36:43.760 --> 3:36:45.800]  said I don't plug enough.
[3:36:45.800 --> 3:36:50.120]  I don't get a chance at least you don't take the time because you're so busy talking about
[3:36:50.120 --> 3:36:54.840]  the topics in the news that you don't get to plug to a funny info or so I just want
[3:36:54.840 --> 3:36:57.800]  to stick that in there real quick.
[3:36:57.800 --> 3:37:03.560]  So I bought the T-shirts, Re-Elect 45 and the Hillary for Prison obviously one of the
[3:37:03.560 --> 3:37:04.560]  most popular.
[3:37:04.560 --> 3:37:08.600]  It's drawing so much attention and I don't know if people believe it or not but it's
[3:37:08.600 --> 3:37:10.680]  all positive attention.
[3:37:10.680 --> 3:37:17.040]  The main reaction that I got myself was from males 18 to 20 years old and middle-aged black
[3:37:17.040 --> 3:37:18.040]  women.
[3:37:18.040 --> 3:37:22.360]  Obviously, honest to God, they were the ones commenting saying I love that shirt.
[3:37:22.360 --> 3:37:27.640]  They would laugh about it, tell their friends about it that when we were public there.
[3:37:27.640 --> 3:37:34.400]  Now the main point I want to get to was the media demonization of yourself and info wars
[3:37:34.400 --> 3:37:39.560]  and with that being said, one thing I know that you don't like to do is talk about yourself
[3:37:39.560 --> 3:37:44.640]  but info wars is at the forefront of the attack from the media.
[3:37:44.640 --> 3:37:49.640]  And one of the things that they so often do and this is what new listeners or non-listeners
[3:37:49.640 --> 3:37:55.000]  need to know is they so often demonize you as being right wing, right wing conspiracy
[3:37:55.000 --> 3:38:00.040]  theorist, right wing extremist and I've been listening to you for probably eight or nine
[3:38:00.040 --> 3:38:05.920]  years now and one thing that you do not claim a political party.
[3:38:05.920 --> 3:38:07.520]  The left are crazy these days.
[3:38:07.520 --> 3:38:11.240]  If you have to choose a side to be on, I would align myself with the right.
[3:38:11.240 --> 3:38:19.280]  But what Alex Jones and the info wars is pro-americana, pro-liberty, pro-freedom and so often you're
[3:38:19.280 --> 3:38:22.520]  getting labeled as this right wing, right wing, right wing.
[3:38:22.520 --> 3:38:27.080]  You are critical of the left or the right, there are crazy on each side, there are good
[3:38:27.080 --> 3:38:28.600]  on each side.
[3:38:28.600 --> 3:38:35.680]  You were very critical of President Bush and everything that happened with 9-11 and the
[3:38:35.680 --> 3:38:42.080]  war in the Middle East and you just have your unbiased opinion without having to lay claim
[3:38:42.080 --> 3:38:46.600]  to a certain political party and I don't think people realize that.
[3:38:46.600 --> 3:38:52.840]  And I got behind Trump because he's done a lot of good, getting us out of the Trans-Pacific
[3:38:52.840 --> 3:38:57.080]  partnership, the transfer of power to the globalist, trying to get jobs back, a lot
[3:38:57.080 --> 3:39:00.640]  of good things Trump's done trying to end these wars, I mean Trump's light years better
[3:39:00.640 --> 3:39:03.800]  than Hillary, I just don't get why he doesn't defend the First Amendment.
[3:39:03.800 --> 3:39:08.920]  I mean it's the huge blurring thing, it's illegal what they're doing and it's absolutely
[3:39:08.920 --> 3:39:09.920]  out of control.
[3:39:09.920 --> 3:39:12.600]  God bless you and I appreciate your call and all the support my friend.
[3:39:12.600 --> 3:39:18.040]  Okay, next holding the longest is Sean and then Jessica, Sean you're on the year, go
[3:39:18.040 --> 3:39:19.040]  ahead.
[3:39:19.040 --> 3:39:21.280]  Hey, hi Alex, long time listener.
[3:39:21.280 --> 3:39:22.280]  Welcome.
[3:39:22.280 --> 3:39:27.200]  I have two things about abortion and the drag shows and I'll make them quick.
[3:39:27.200 --> 3:39:31.800]  The best way to discredit the abortion supporters and their politicians is to get some of the
[3:39:31.800 --> 3:39:38.000]  most graphic messed up footage of actual abortions and interviews of the mother.
[3:39:38.000 --> 3:39:42.800]  Once videos have been produced, you can release the videos on every social media platform,
[3:39:42.800 --> 3:39:47.440]  on multiple accounts, and bits aren't two weeks before the presidential election.
[3:39:47.440 --> 3:39:50.400]  This will discredit the whole system.
[3:39:50.400 --> 3:39:56.480]  I agree with you that especially with Hispanic voters, God bless them, they are against abortion
[3:39:56.480 --> 3:40:01.080]  because they love babies, good people, and they're trying to sell Hispanics on voting
[3:40:01.080 --> 3:40:04.520]  for Democrats, but now it's not just kill a baby.
[3:40:04.520 --> 3:40:08.840]  However it's born, it's kill them after they're born, so I think we just get that out to Hispanic
[3:40:08.840 --> 3:40:13.200]  voters nationwide and say, hey, whatever BS you heard, Republicans aren't for killing
[3:40:13.200 --> 3:40:14.600]  babies after they're born.
[3:40:14.600 --> 3:40:17.720]  So you vote for Democrats, you vote for killing babies.
[3:40:17.720 --> 3:40:21.880]  And I can't believe the Democrats did this, but they're already selling the organs.
[3:40:21.880 --> 3:40:26.680]  They know it's coming out, so they need to legalize it or they're going to go to prison.
[3:40:26.680 --> 3:40:29.200]  See why they're in a rock, in a hard place.
[3:40:29.200 --> 3:40:36.040]  All right, and the second thing is, you cited several scientific articles proving that
[3:40:36.040 --> 3:40:39.600]  Actuzine is responsible for feminizing men.
[3:40:39.600 --> 3:40:44.560]  If the data proves the drug is responsible for the behavior, I think we as Christians
[3:40:44.560 --> 3:40:50.200]  should show compassion for the afflicted by going after the chemical companies responsible
[3:40:50.200 --> 3:40:53.880]  for the LGBT movement, not demonizing them.
[3:40:53.880 --> 3:41:00.280]  Well, listen, I agree with you that, quote, people like to name homosexuals, it's a scientific
[3:41:00.280 --> 3:41:02.800]  name like heterosexual.
[3:41:02.800 --> 3:41:07.320]  Homosexuals are a whole spectrum of people, a lot of nice people, I'm not attacking those
[3:41:07.320 --> 3:41:12.040]  type of folks, but, and there's people that throughout history without chemicals are attracted
[3:41:12.040 --> 3:41:14.160]  to the same sex.
[3:41:14.160 --> 3:41:19.000]  And there is some studies that show some genetics on that front, I'm not getting into all that.
[3:41:19.000 --> 3:41:29.320]  I'm saying LGBT is turning into LBGTP, Actuzine is confusing the sex and is causing a massive
[3:41:29.320 --> 3:41:36.640]  explosion of people having issues, and David Hogg's response is, well, good, it's good
[3:41:36.640 --> 3:41:37.640]  to have more gay people.
[3:41:37.640 --> 3:41:40.520]  Well, you also get a higher risk of cancer.
[3:41:40.520 --> 3:41:44.760]  And so, yeah, it's affecting our brains, it's affecting our genitals, it's affecting women's
[3:41:44.760 --> 3:41:45.760]  breast.
[3:41:45.760 --> 3:41:50.880]  So, Actuzine gives women breast cancer, Roundup gives women breast cancer, it gives men cancer
[3:41:50.880 --> 3:41:56.440]  of the prostate, and those are in the major studies, so I hear you and I appreciate you.
[3:41:56.440 --> 3:42:05.520]  I am not, let me taste, right now, okay, I'm married, I'm a good guy, but I'm a pig, okay,
[3:42:05.520 --> 3:42:10.760]  and growing up and in between being divorced and stuff, I'm a wild man, okay, and I think
[3:42:10.760 --> 3:42:16.920]  on God's scale, you know, running around carousing with women is on par, you know, over here
[3:42:16.920 --> 3:42:18.360]  with guys with each other or whatever.
[3:42:18.360 --> 3:42:24.800]  I'm not even on people's tails about that, okay, what I'm saying is, is that the global
[3:42:24.800 --> 3:42:29.520]  is promoting it to hurt us, and the highest group of people committing suicide and dying
[3:42:29.520 --> 3:42:34.480]  alone or gay men, and the left doesn't want the Christians to be able to reach out to
[3:42:34.480 --> 3:42:38.400]  them and try to help them and say, hey, if you don't like this lifestyle, you could get
[3:42:38.400 --> 3:42:39.400]  out of it.
[3:42:39.400 --> 3:42:44.640]  That's all I'm saying, and so I do not hate people, I'm not like, well that guy, he loves
[3:42:44.640 --> 3:42:49.840]  guys, so I'm gonna beat his ass, give me a break, come on, that's not who I am, and I
[3:42:49.840 --> 3:42:53.240]  don't think you're saying that, but that's not who I am, we're calls coming up.
[3:42:53.240 --> 3:42:58.840]  The globalist, the eugenicist are always talking down to us, they're always trying to make
[3:42:58.840 --> 3:43:04.840]  us feel small, to feel insignificant, they try to censor, because they fear you and don't
[3:43:04.840 --> 3:43:10.320]  want you to have the right to access information so you can make your own decisions, they want
[3:43:10.320 --> 3:43:15.960]  you to believe you're powerless, but the truth is, it is we the people and our ideas and
[3:43:15.960 --> 3:43:23.200]  our actions, and what we say and what we do that changes the world, we are the power structure,
[3:43:23.200 --> 3:43:30.080]  we are the inventors, we are the trailblazers, and the globalists understand that, and they
[3:43:30.080 --> 3:43:35.520]  understand that they are basically trying to control and steal the future from we the
[3:43:35.520 --> 3:43:36.520]  people.
[3:43:36.520 --> 3:43:41.800]  Now, to help fund our operation that is undoubtedly the very tip of the spear against these globalists,
[3:43:41.800 --> 3:43:46.040]  I want to encourage listeners and viewers to understand that throughout the second half
[3:43:46.040 --> 3:43:51.040]  of the month of March, we're going to have store-wide free shipping, and 50% off at m4store.com,
[3:43:51.040 --> 3:43:53.640]  something everybody should take advantage of.
[3:43:53.640 --> 3:43:57.640]  Our grandparents, the great grandparents, they can food during the fall, so they have
[3:43:57.640 --> 3:43:58.640]  it during the winter.
[3:43:58.640 --> 3:44:05.600]  And that's what I'm talking about at m4store.com, with m4 select, it's the full spectrum of
[3:44:05.600 --> 3:44:10.800]  my patriots supply on the top, most respected companies out there, but because I private
[3:44:10.800 --> 3:44:16.720]  label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able
[3:44:16.720 --> 3:44:17.720]  to do.
[3:44:17.720 --> 3:44:21.680]  But I want to be a market leader, and I want you to have storeable food, so it's a total
[3:44:21.680 --> 3:44:22.680]  win-win.
[3:44:22.680 --> 3:44:28.520]  We have those incredible sell prices back at m4store.com, on m4 select, storeable foods,
[3:44:28.520 --> 3:44:32.760]  they've got special diet foods, they've got three-month supplies, your supplies, weak
[3:44:32.760 --> 3:44:36.800]  emergency supplies, they've got so many great products there, and you've got a three-year
[3:44:36.800 --> 3:44:37.800]  supply.
[3:44:37.800 --> 3:44:39.760]  If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[3:44:39.760 --> 3:44:42.320]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[3:44:42.320 --> 3:44:47.320]  You're buying war bonds, bringing great products, and together, with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[3:44:47.320 --> 3:44:54.320]  m4store.com, and m4 select, high-quality, storeable foods, powered by my patriots supply.
[3:44:54.320 --> 3:44:58.360]  If you're not expanding, you're imploding, there is no set stasis.
[3:44:58.360 --> 3:44:59.600]  There is no managed system.
[3:44:59.600 --> 3:45:01.200]  There is no uncontenual.
[3:45:01.200 --> 3:45:06.880]  The continuum is always launching forward in the future, so you support us and get creative
[3:45:06.880 --> 3:45:07.880]  and get fired up.
[3:45:07.880 --> 3:45:11.080]  We won't just be here 100 years, we'll be here forever, we'll turn the whole thing around.
[3:45:11.080 --> 3:45:15.760]  Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases, and God knows what, are going to look back
[3:45:15.760 --> 3:45:20.320]  and say, you know, we struggled here, we made it, and that's really where this goes.
[3:45:20.320 --> 3:45:24.480]  Okay, God's got a big war for you, Reddy, and so, if you can't face George Soros and
[3:45:24.480 --> 3:45:28.080]  Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler and Mao Zedong, are you going to really be able to
[3:45:28.080 --> 3:45:29.600]  face the other stuff?
[3:45:29.600 --> 3:45:33.960]  Because God wants warriors that are smart and are ready to build things and are also
[3:45:33.960 --> 3:45:34.960]  ready to fight.
[3:45:34.960 --> 3:45:37.920]  You don't go to the next level without getting a big weight put on your back, and, I mean,
[3:45:37.920 --> 3:45:39.560]  I don't know what's going to happen to me in the future.
[3:45:39.560 --> 3:45:43.200]  I mean, all I know is, I want to go with the master built.
[3:45:43.200 --> 3:45:44.360]  I want to go to the next level.
[3:45:44.360 --> 3:45:48.960]  I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced, not these devil worshipers.
[3:45:48.960 --> 3:45:51.640]  They're cold and failed and feels like being in a tomb.
[3:45:51.640 --> 3:45:52.760]  I want life.
[3:45:52.760 --> 3:46:03.480]  I want Jesus.
[3:46:03.480 --> 3:46:09.960]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best selling supplement family in the world is
[3:46:09.960 --> 3:46:16.240]  energy drinks and energy supplements, but they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic
[3:46:16.240 --> 3:46:20.320]  caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a
[3:46:20.320 --> 3:46:22.560]  few hours and have terrible side effects.
[3:46:22.560 --> 3:46:29.120]  We have developed hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink, pre-workout
[3:46:29.120 --> 3:46:32.000]  and beyond system in the world.
[3:46:32.000 --> 3:46:34.440]  There's nothing else like it, you must experience it.
[3:46:34.440 --> 3:46:39.000]  It is a total game changer and it comes in easy to use, packaged, mixed in with fruit
[3:46:39.000 --> 3:46:41.480]  juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[3:46:41.480 --> 3:46:45.320]  Warning though, it's very, very strong, it lasts 10 hours, so take a half packet the
[3:46:45.320 --> 3:46:49.360]  first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you
[3:46:49.360 --> 3:46:51.560]  into overdrive.
[3:46:51.560 --> 3:46:57.880]  TurboForce and enforcelife.com.
[3:46:57.880 --> 3:47:07.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:47:07.360 --> 3:47:15.920]  The only two things in life that make it worth living is guitars are too good and firm, feeling
[3:47:15.920 --> 3:47:16.920]  women.
[3:47:16.920 --> 3:47:25.520]  I don't need my name in the marquee lights, I got my song and it got you with me tonight,
[3:47:25.520 --> 3:47:31.560]  maybe it's time we got back to the basics of love.
[3:47:31.560 --> 3:47:39.160]  Let's go to Lukenbach Texas, that is a pretty spot over in the Hill Country, between Fredericksburg
[3:47:39.160 --> 3:47:40.160]  and Herville.
[3:47:40.160 --> 3:47:52.440]  We're going to go back to your phone calls, then the War Room kicks up, I'll be back tonight,
[3:47:52.440 --> 3:47:57.880]  8 o'clock, bunch of big guests lined up, we're focusing on the First Amendment, how to defend
[3:47:57.880 --> 3:48:02.960]  it, how to take action, and the power of you, the listeners and viewers on AM and FM, TV,
[3:48:02.960 --> 3:48:06.440]  internet, tell them folks how you're listening, spread the word, it's beautiful, via your
[3:48:06.440 --> 3:48:10.600]  email, via your text message, call mom up, call your son up, call your brother up, call
[3:48:10.600 --> 3:48:13.520]  your husband up, call your neighbor up, tell them, hey, you've heard about this guy getting
[3:48:13.520 --> 3:48:18.560]  demonized, find out what they're talking about, but we're talking about them making
[3:48:18.560 --> 3:48:21.480]  their move against our children, that's why they want to shut down.
[3:48:21.480 --> 3:48:26.960]  Briefly, we've got store-wide free shipping, 50% off all the supplements, but every hour,
[3:48:26.960 --> 3:48:30.560]  because I did this a lot late, I'm going to extend a lot of these for a few more hours,
[3:48:30.560 --> 3:48:37.480]  we have 60% off, Rainforest Plus, the Great Neutropic, we have 55% off, All Super Blue,
[3:48:37.480 --> 3:48:42.760]  Colloidal Silver, Iodine Fortified, Toothpaste, Mouthwash, Immune Gargle, All Fluoride Free,
[3:48:42.760 --> 3:48:46.120]  biggest discount ever on that, and we've got a bunch of other big specials running at
[3:48:46.120 --> 3:48:50.880]  infowarkstore.com, our call toll free, triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three,
[3:48:50.880 --> 3:48:54.480]  nine, there's also a mailing address, they're on the site, any orders that come in the next
[3:48:54.480 --> 3:48:58.680]  few days will be locked in at those prices, but you can just buy your toothpaste, buy
[3:48:58.680 --> 3:49:03.800]  your coffee, buy your energy bars, buy your whatever from us, and that lets us stand against
[3:49:03.800 --> 3:49:08.240]  the incredible stuff behind the scenes, I'm not complaining, I expected this, but it's
[3:49:08.240 --> 3:49:14.880]  James Bond level every day, just keeping the wheels rolling to stay on air is the treachery,
[3:49:14.880 --> 3:49:21.520]  the manipulation, the darkness is incredible, but God always comes through, so number one,
[3:49:21.520 --> 3:49:26.240]  please pray for us. All right, I've got loaded phones here still, trying to get to everybody,
[3:49:26.240 --> 3:49:31.840]  appreciate everybody holding, let's talk to Jessica, you're on the air from Virginia,
[3:49:31.840 --> 3:49:36.880]  welcome. Hi Alex, first of all, I'd like to say you're
[3:49:36.880 --> 3:49:45.600]  so on fire today, so on point, and when you're like that, it just stirs my spirit even more,
[3:49:45.600 --> 3:49:51.400]  so I think that sometimes you apologize for that, but we need it, because there's so many
[3:49:51.400 --> 3:49:56.880]  people that are just so zombified, so asleep, that we have to have something, it's like
[3:49:56.880 --> 3:50:05.520]  sometimes people need a slap in the face rather than a gentle little waking up.
[3:50:05.520 --> 3:50:09.840]  No, I agree, we need to get that ice water thrown on us.
[3:50:09.840 --> 3:50:19.920]  Right, exactly, exactly, and I think that especially right now with all of the fake
[3:50:19.920 --> 3:50:26.320]  news and all of the indoctrination, all of the poisoning of the mind, we have to have
[3:50:26.320 --> 3:50:40.360]  that on a larger scale, but I was listening to you talking about spending time with God
[3:50:40.360 --> 3:50:47.000]  and you're alone time with God, and I think that is so important before you do something
[3:50:47.000 --> 3:50:52.680]  like what you do and how you're attacked and things like that, because spirit speaks to
[3:50:52.680 --> 3:51:03.280]  spirit, and so that's helping us who are of like spirit, who are in Christ, really connect
[3:51:03.280 --> 3:51:07.640]  with one another, and we're connecting with what you're doing, and what you're saying.
[3:51:07.640 --> 3:51:10.040]  I mean, I totally agree, we have to sync up, and the problem is you get really close to
[3:51:10.040 --> 3:51:15.160]  God at 3am or 6am, and then you cook breakfast, deal with traffic, come into work, look at
[3:51:15.160 --> 3:51:19.200]  all the articles, and you kind of lose God again, focusing just on all the minutiae when
[3:51:19.200 --> 3:51:21.040]  it really just comes back to God.
[3:51:21.040 --> 3:51:27.840]  Yeah, but I think that's been a big why because I pray all the time, all the time for the
[3:51:27.840 --> 3:51:32.840]  InfoWars crew, for the president, because we know how much you're under attack, so I
[3:51:32.840 --> 3:51:38.880]  just want to encourage everyone who is listening, please pray for Alex, please pray for David
[3:51:38.880 --> 3:51:44.840]  Knight, the entire InfoWars crew and our president and these people who really are trying to fight
[3:51:44.840 --> 3:51:54.960]  against this terrible Babylonian worshipping system, because if it's not for you guys,
[3:51:54.960 --> 3:51:55.960]  we're lost.
[3:51:55.960 --> 3:51:59.400]  Well, we're lost without you, the audience, because this is a place where the audience
[3:51:59.400 --> 3:52:01.360]  is the audience, you are everything.
[3:52:01.360 --> 3:52:03.760]  God bless you, and thank you, Jessica, beautiful call.
[3:52:03.760 --> 3:52:04.760]  Thank you for your support.
[3:52:04.760 --> 3:52:05.760]  We're in this together.
[3:52:05.760 --> 3:52:11.240]  It's been holding the next longest here, trying to go fast with everybody.
[3:52:11.240 --> 3:52:12.960]  Lee in Idaho, you're on the air.
[3:52:12.960 --> 3:52:15.080]  Thanks for holding and Shelby.
[3:52:15.080 --> 3:52:18.520]  Hey, brother, it's really good to talk to you.
[3:52:18.520 --> 3:52:19.520]  Thank you.
[3:52:19.520 --> 3:52:20.520]  Yeah.
[3:52:20.520 --> 3:52:22.120]  I just wanted to say one thing.
[3:52:22.120 --> 3:52:29.200]  I think where we're really wrong on this abortion issue as Americans is that we're killing an
[3:52:29.200 --> 3:52:34.120]  American citizen in private.
[3:52:34.120 --> 3:52:35.520]  You really think about it.
[3:52:35.520 --> 3:52:41.000]  Yeah, there's no judge, there's no jury, and the governor who's a doctor says, we don't
[3:52:41.000 --> 3:52:45.360]  want government involved, we don't want courts involved, just give us the babies.
[3:52:45.360 --> 3:52:47.800]  How creepy is that?
[3:52:47.800 --> 3:52:54.400]  It's really creepy because our federal government's first duty is to protect every citizen right
[3:52:54.400 --> 3:52:58.720]  to life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness.
[3:52:58.720 --> 3:53:05.160]  And we have one group of citizens in the United States that are, that's the most vulnerable
[3:53:05.160 --> 3:53:08.800]  and defenseless that are not getting those rights protected.
[3:53:08.800 --> 3:53:11.320]  No, you make a great point.
[3:53:11.320 --> 3:53:12.560]  They have a constitutional right.
[3:53:12.560 --> 3:53:16.400]  We talk about black people or white people or Native Americans having rights to vote
[3:53:16.400 --> 3:53:17.400]  or whatever.
[3:53:17.400 --> 3:53:21.080]  How about a right to not be chopped up after you're born or kept alive in your organs
[3:53:21.080 --> 3:53:22.080]  taken?
[3:53:22.080 --> 3:53:25.320]  This is so fundamental and it just shows, I remember the old timers like 20 something
[3:53:25.320 --> 3:53:29.760]  years ago, they're like, Alex soon they'll have teaching, you know, they'll be teaching
[3:53:29.760 --> 3:53:36.720]  kids sex and they'll have, you know, Nambla in the schools and they'll be doing all this
[3:53:36.720 --> 3:53:41.440]  and they'll be aborting kids after they're born and they'll be killing old people.
[3:53:41.440 --> 3:53:43.800]  And now it all happened.
[3:53:43.800 --> 3:53:48.240]  Yeah, the crepes are running the, you know, nut farm.
[3:53:48.240 --> 3:53:52.920]  I just think that, you know, you know, I want legislation.
[3:53:52.920 --> 3:53:55.000]  I want somebody who's, you know, brave.
[3:53:55.000 --> 3:54:01.000]  I want Trump to step up Trump introduced legislation and his credit and the Senate voted it down
[3:54:01.000 --> 3:54:06.400]  to not kill already born babies, which is a legalization of killing babies.
[3:54:06.400 --> 3:54:11.200]  I think there needs to be a bureaucracy for him and you need to have a liaison at every
[3:54:11.200 --> 3:54:15.160]  Planned Parenthood because you should not be able to end a citizen's life.
[3:54:15.160 --> 3:54:16.160]  No, I hear you.
[3:54:16.160 --> 3:54:21.040]  And by the way, I don't want violence offensively, but how does Congress or any of these groups
[3:54:21.040 --> 3:54:24.280]  stand up when they're killing babies after they're born?
[3:54:24.280 --> 3:54:28.160]  How are they going to say it's wrong if somebody attacks them?
[3:54:28.160 --> 3:54:31.520]  Because you know, it's just the universe doesn't put up with this.
[3:54:31.520 --> 3:54:32.520]  God doesn't put up with it.
[3:54:32.520 --> 3:54:33.520]  Powerful point.
[3:54:33.520 --> 3:54:35.520]  Thank you, Lee.
[3:54:35.520 --> 3:54:39.000]  And we've got a bunch of callers here.
[3:54:39.000 --> 3:54:40.000]  We got Dustin.
[3:54:40.000 --> 3:54:41.000]  We got Shelby.
[3:54:41.000 --> 3:54:42.000]  We got Randy.
[3:54:42.000 --> 3:54:43.000]  We got Matthew.
[3:54:43.000 --> 3:54:44.000]  We got knowledge.
[3:54:44.000 --> 3:54:49.080]  I'm trying to get to everybody who's been home the longest to be Randy.
[3:54:49.080 --> 3:54:50.480]  Other callers call me back at eight o'clock tonight.
[3:54:50.480 --> 3:54:51.480]  I go right to you.
[3:54:51.480 --> 3:54:52.480]  I promise.
[3:54:52.480 --> 3:54:53.480]  Like even write down their names and numbers.
[3:54:53.480 --> 3:54:55.880]  If you want, I'll put them on first tonight at eight o'clock when I come back.
[3:54:55.880 --> 3:54:56.880]  We're 50 hour broadcast.
[3:54:56.880 --> 3:54:57.880]  Owen's coming up a bunch of others.
[3:54:57.880 --> 3:55:03.000]  But let me try to jam in one more right now who's been home the longest here.
[3:55:03.000 --> 3:55:04.000]  Randy and Indiana.
[3:55:04.000 --> 3:55:05.000]  Go ahead, Randy.
[3:55:05.000 --> 3:55:06.000]  Oh, great.
[3:55:06.000 --> 3:55:07.000]  Am I on?
[3:55:07.000 --> 3:55:08.000]  Yes, sir.
[3:55:08.000 --> 3:55:09.000]  Okay.
[3:55:09.000 --> 3:55:11.520]  I'm going to make this as quick as I can.
[3:55:11.520 --> 3:55:13.520]  The United States started the internet.
[3:55:13.520 --> 3:55:17.080]  Google came off the internet and that's what they're using.
[3:55:17.080 --> 3:55:23.520]  If they help the Chinese military in any direction, Trump can hold that company and the CEO for
[3:55:23.520 --> 3:55:24.520]  treason.
[3:55:24.520 --> 3:55:33.600]  Second thing is, these companies are going over there to China and transferring technology
[3:55:33.600 --> 3:55:34.600]  to these companies.
[3:55:34.600 --> 3:55:35.600]  That's treason.
[3:55:35.600 --> 3:55:42.920]  Which is treason because if they manufactured anything to the US military, that was secret.
[3:55:42.920 --> 3:55:43.920]  That's treason.
[3:55:43.920 --> 3:55:48.320]  If you or I worked at Google and we gave it to a private company, we'd go to jail.
[3:55:48.320 --> 3:55:50.560]  How do they give it to a dictatorship?
[3:55:50.560 --> 3:55:51.560]  That's exactly right.
[3:55:51.560 --> 3:55:52.560]  But here's the other thing.
[3:55:52.560 --> 3:55:54.320]  China is not forced them.
[3:55:54.320 --> 3:55:57.600]  China's saying, look, we're going to give you a whole bunch of cheap labor.
[3:55:57.600 --> 3:56:00.280]  You won't hardly have to pay anything for the labor.
[3:56:00.280 --> 3:56:03.200]  And China is wanting all that manufacturing over there.
[3:56:03.200 --> 3:56:04.200]  They can.
[3:56:04.200 --> 3:56:08.960]  If you remember during World War II, the only reason we beat the Germans, their tanks
[3:56:08.960 --> 3:56:13.280]  was 10 times better bars, but we built them chervrens and there's just too many of them.
[3:56:13.280 --> 3:56:14.680]  We've come like ants.
[3:56:14.680 --> 3:56:19.000]  Now, the second thing I've got to tell you, and I'm trying to make this quick.
[3:56:19.000 --> 3:56:23.040]  During World War II, you had General Motors, you had Ford.
[3:56:23.040 --> 3:56:26.080]  The Ford transmission could be interchanged with theirs.
[3:56:26.080 --> 3:56:29.880]  You had IBM, and you had the Bushes, which was a Nazi.
[3:56:29.880 --> 3:56:36.240]  It was top push finance, the Nazis, and Roosevelt passed the law in 1942.
[3:56:36.240 --> 3:56:40.200]  If anybody did business with the enemy was going to be put up for treason.
[3:56:40.200 --> 3:56:44.000]  The only reason Bush escaped was because he started the USO.
[3:56:44.000 --> 3:56:45.000]  No, that's that's true.
[3:56:45.000 --> 3:56:48.400]  So he should use trading with the enemy act against all these globalists.
[3:56:48.400 --> 3:56:49.400]  That's totally right.
[3:56:49.400 --> 3:56:53.040]  Well, I believe that Trump's going to come after these companies.
[3:56:53.040 --> 3:56:54.040]  I really believe that.
[3:56:54.040 --> 3:56:55.720]  He sure is how he needs them.
[3:56:55.720 --> 3:57:00.280]  He needs to go after Google because she's letting them off the hook and if they had
[3:57:00.280 --> 3:57:06.040]  any way helped the Chinese military, they treason is punishable by death.
[3:57:06.040 --> 3:57:08.360]  By the way, top general came out and said that today.
[3:57:08.360 --> 3:57:09.360]  I didn't get to it.
[3:57:09.360 --> 3:57:10.360]  I'll cover eight o'clock.
[3:57:10.360 --> 3:57:11.520]  Thank you so much, sir.
[3:57:11.520 --> 3:57:12.520]  Thank you, Randy.
[3:57:12.520 --> 3:57:13.520]  Great points.
[3:57:13.520 --> 3:57:14.520]  Call back tonight.
[3:57:14.520 --> 3:57:15.520]  Get all their names including Randy.
[3:57:15.520 --> 3:57:16.520]  We'll have you back on all these callers.
[3:57:16.520 --> 3:57:17.520]  I'll be back at eight.
[3:57:17.520 --> 3:57:18.520]  Owen's coming up.
[3:57:18.520 --> 3:57:21.720]  Owen Schreuer, please pray for him for wars and please eventually support us.
[3:57:21.720 --> 3:57:22.720]  We need the help.
[3:57:22.720 --> 3:57:25.800]  They're trying to shut us down.
[3:57:25.800 --> 3:57:28.720]  I can't get into it on air, but it's just we're going to we're going to God always
[3:57:28.720 --> 3:57:33.720]  comes through through you, so please info or store.com, get the staples you need and

[3:57:35.720 --> 3:57:36.720]  I'm humble.
[3:57:36.720 --> 3:57:37.720]  I appreciate you.
[3:57:37.720 --> 3:57:38.720]  Great job.
[3:57:38.720 --> 3:57:40.720]  The crew war rooms coming up in the 50 hour broadcast for the links.
[3:57:40.720 --> 3:57:41.720]  Thank you.
