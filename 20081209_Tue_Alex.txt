[00:00.000 --> 00:14.240]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.240 --> 00:42.000]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones well ladies and gentlemen out
[00:42.000 --> 00:49.440]  of the gates we have General Hamid Ghul and of course he was the head of Pakistani intelligence
[00:49.440 --> 00:56.960]  back in the 1980s he went on CNN on Sunday night on one of their international programs and talked
[00:56.960 --> 01:02.160]  about the fact that he believed 9-11 was an inside job and that the Mumbai attacks formerly Bombay
[01:02.160 --> 01:08.640]  were also an inside job as you know we have detailed that that was a false flag attack carried out by
[01:08.640 --> 01:14.960]  western intelligence clearly in india as a pretext to start a world war three between the two nations
[01:14.960 --> 01:19.360]  there were also calls the pakistani government has now said that we're officially made
[01:19.360 --> 01:24.240]  confirmed with the phone records from the indian foreign ministry saying we are going to attack
[01:24.240 --> 01:30.240]  you attempting to trick the pakistanis into launching some type of attack and that almost
[01:30.240 --> 01:36.000]  happened and so for the next 30 minutes i'm very honored to be joined by general hamid ghul
[01:36.000 --> 01:41.360]  and general joining us from pakistan thank you so much for coming on with us today you're welcome
[01:42.400 --> 01:46.640]  just out of the gates i was told by your son that you were not happy with the cnn the interview
[01:46.640 --> 01:52.880]  that they edited you so you've got the floor sir we're not going to edit you you are live so tell
[01:52.880 --> 02:00.640]  the world what is really going on but at the moment we have to look at this the human great human
[02:00.640 --> 02:07.280]  tragedy that took place in bombay i sympathize with india they've been rocked very badly and their
[02:07.280 --> 02:12.640]  response is a bit nervous they want to go to war with pakistan if pakistan does not behave or does
[02:12.640 --> 02:20.800]  not hand over uh whoever they want from us they have given a list of people but i think it there
[02:20.800 --> 02:27.440]  has been a long record of the indians accusing pakistan whenever something like this happens
[02:27.440 --> 02:33.840]  and in the past they have turned out to be every time wrong of course pakistan is willing to cooperate
[02:33.840 --> 02:40.480]  and i think that's a good position that president alzari has taken that you provide the evidence
[02:40.480 --> 02:47.920]  and we will try them out we will arrest them we will put them um to trial and you can come and
[02:47.920 --> 02:55.040]  watch see let the international cameras come and see and uh there should be a transparent
[02:55.040 --> 03:03.040]  um open trial and if that does not satisfy you then what else will so this is the situation
[03:03.040 --> 03:11.840]  where we stand today there is um an ominous threat from india and america seems to be quietly
[03:11.840 --> 03:17.440]  patting them on the back and asking pakistan to do whatever india is demanding now this is an
[03:17.440 --> 03:23.360]  unfair position because india is not like america america demanded from pakistan back since after
[03:23.360 --> 03:29.280]  uh 9 11 to cooperate and hand over anybody that pakistan could lay their hands on
[03:29.920 --> 03:37.040]  700 or so people were caught in pakistan they were sent to gantram abey to bagram and to kandhar
[03:37.040 --> 03:42.960]  jail and nothing came out karish seh muhammad is the only one who's been tried in that case all
[03:42.960 --> 03:50.240]  others have been let off so to get innocent people like that just because you accuse them and you
[03:50.240 --> 03:56.720]  don't even provide the evidence to pick them up and shove them in jail this is not on i think this
[03:57.760 --> 04:05.920]  belittle the the human values that particularly democracies uphold and they talk so much about
[04:06.480 --> 04:12.720]  so i think pakistan's offer is a good enough and today pakistan cracked down on some of the
[04:12.720 --> 04:21.920]  defunct organizations uh in fact these were banned in year 2002 immediately after 9 11
[04:22.480 --> 04:29.040]  but there could be some maverick elements among them who would still uh i won't rule out could
[04:29.040 --> 04:37.760]  carry out uh in on their own or in conjunction with some other forces such such kind of atrocity
[04:37.760 --> 04:45.280]  uh but we have to wait and see how it goes okay mr a mr gull general hami gull please
[04:45.280 --> 04:49.280]  stay with us we're gonna break and come back in a long segment uh plenty of time for you to
[04:49.280 --> 04:55.520]  break down what's really happening the serious tensions uh being uh i'm being risen uh due to
[04:55.520 --> 05:02.560]  what happened a few weeks ago in india please stay with us hello friends this is alex jones
[05:02.560 --> 05:06.800]  i've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient and today that's more important
[05:06.800 --> 05:11.280]  than ever we need to be independent and food and water is the key you'll never have to stand in
[05:11.280 --> 05:15.600]  a bread line if you have your own bread you'll never have to go to the super dome and beg for
[05:15.600 --> 05:20.560]  femen to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare our elected representatives
[05:20.560 --> 05:25.360]  wanted a good old boy bailout for a special interest so they ignored your screams not to do it they
[05:25.360 --> 05:30.960]  turned off the telephones and email they voted to print 850 billion dollars at least out of thin air
[05:30.960 --> 05:36.240]  this money now owns the american and european banks the exploding inflation that is now guaranteed
[05:36.240 --> 05:41.120]  will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of assassins particularly food
[05:41.120 --> 05:46.800]  beyond many americans reach in pre-nazi germany super inflation the cost of a loaf of bread doubled
[05:46.800 --> 05:52.240]  every two days until it reached over four billion marks food prices are skyrocketing so fast
[05:52.240 --> 05:56.800]  there seems as if there may be no end in sight the private banks merging with our government
[05:56.800 --> 06:01.440]  are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves the stores have less food
[06:01.440 --> 06:06.320]  but jack of prices to stay in business whatever happens in america we need to be prepared and be
[06:06.320 --> 06:11.120]  ready everything is zeroing in on food one third of americans have to choose between buying food
[06:11.120 --> 06:16.080]  and paying for other necessities my friends whatever it takes get prepared get self-sufficient
[06:16.080 --> 06:19.920]  get food for everybody out there listening it's very important for you to understand that by
[06:19.920 --> 06:24.320]  having a supply of storable food the government the new old order has a lot less control over you
[06:24.320 --> 06:29.200]  and so it's a mindset a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness no one is going to take care
[06:29.200 --> 06:33.760]  of your family in the final equation but you you know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship

[07:13.200 --> 07:20.480]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[07:20.480 --> 07:29.440]  he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[07:32.960 --> 07:40.160]  reading from wikipedia general hameed gul served as director general of pakistan's
[07:40.160 --> 07:45.600]  inner service intelligence isi during 87 89 mainly in the time when benesir budo was prime
[07:45.600 --> 07:50.320]  minister of pakistan he was instrumental in the anti-soviet support of the muja hadin and
[07:50.320 --> 07:57.040]  the afghan war 79 to 89 a pivotal time during the cold war and the stem and it goes on and we
[07:57.040 --> 08:02.320]  have him online with us we of course yesterday played the cnn tv interview he did that was
[08:02.320 --> 08:07.840]  heavily edited this is live and is not edited going back to him in pakistan we've tried three
[08:07.840 --> 08:12.880]  different lines this is the best one we have we apologize our audio is not loud to him is not very
[08:12.880 --> 08:19.120]  audible and obviously his audio back to us is very very broken up but we nevertheless have him
[08:19.120 --> 08:26.080]  joining us and we're very thankful sir continuing on the cnn program at least what they edited you
[08:26.080 --> 08:31.840]  to say you talked about 9 11 the evidence being that 9 11 was an inside job and the attacks in
[08:31.840 --> 08:38.800]  bombay now moon by a few weeks ago that the evidence was it was an inside job can you go over
[08:38.800 --> 08:43.760]  the evidence that you believe that these are false flag events sir and why these false flag
[08:43.760 --> 08:52.080]  events are being staged are you talking about 9 11 yes sir well i have my own reason you know
[08:52.080 --> 08:57.440]  rod norland was the senior reporter here i think he was based in islam was at that time
[08:58.160 --> 09:06.880]  and he came to me immediately after 9 11 and his version that that i put out it was given to the
[09:06.880 --> 09:13.360]  newsweek and unfortunately it was blocked but it appeared on the internet on the website of the
[09:13.360 --> 09:21.920]  newsweek and you can see it i think it is dated 16th or 17th of september 2001 and in that i had
[09:21.920 --> 09:29.520]  said the same thing and i still maintain that that's my position i have following reasons for it a
[09:30.320 --> 09:39.440]  that 9 11 took place on the american soil not a single person has been caught inside america
[09:39.440 --> 09:45.440]  even though for doing such a job i think a huge amount of logistic support is required in the area
[09:46.080 --> 09:53.600]  where such operation is carried out secondly the air traffic control when they saw that
[09:53.600 --> 09:59.600]  four aircarts were changing direction going from east coast to west coast where they were
[09:59.600 --> 10:05.680]  headed they started traveling in different directions and it is quite amazing that
[10:05.680 --> 10:12.160]  for a very long period of time the air traffic control did not report this nor did the u.s
[10:12.160 --> 10:21.440]  air force act in time if one were to calculate from the first flight when it took off from logan
[10:21.440 --> 10:29.360]  till the the first aircraft and the solitary aircraft that took off was an f-16 which took
[10:29.360 --> 10:36.240]  off from langley which is ci's headquarter instead of one of the operational bases so many of them
[10:36.240 --> 10:42.880]  are available in that area and then a single aircraft never takes off because we have been told
[10:42.880 --> 10:50.560]  that wherever the aircraft trembled they scrambled in two and the time that it took was enormous it
[10:50.560 --> 10:59.120]  was 112 minutes so 112 minutes is a very long time in which to act was the u.s air force
[10:59.120 --> 11:05.760]  sleeping and if it was sleeping which heads were rolled second it was a huge intelligence
[11:05.760 --> 11:12.480]  failure and no heads have been rolled nobody has been taken to task not a single person has
[11:12.480 --> 11:18.960]  resigned for this thirdly the air traffic control should have been rehashed they should have been
[11:18.960 --> 11:27.200]  turned inside out but nothing of the sort happened and finally how come this is a coincidence that
[11:27.200 --> 11:35.840]  four transponders did not work and it is it is not possible the direction is changed and it is not
[11:35.840 --> 11:44.720]  noted secondly the u.s air force has the ability because in the past whenever a plane has been
[11:44.720 --> 11:51.360]  hijacked the record is that within seven minutes the u.s aircraft has been on the wing of the
[11:51.360 --> 12:00.560]  hijacked aircraft in this case it it did not happen the u.s alert system is so high and it is so
[12:00.560 --> 12:08.160]  sophisticated that if a missile was to take off from Moscow and was to head towards new york
[12:08.160 --> 12:15.680]  it takes about 18 minutes and the u.s air force and the missile system is supposed to intercept
[12:15.680 --> 12:23.120]  it within nine minutes that means on the atlantic or on the pacific it must stop that missile from
[12:23.120 --> 12:31.360]  coming in the system is in place but it did not work and nobody tried to question this lastly no
[12:31.360 --> 12:37.120]  inquiry has so far been held formally into the incident and the whole world has been turned
[12:37.120 --> 12:43.440]  upside down so many people have been killed american economy is going into a meltdown
[12:43.440 --> 12:49.200]  and everything has gone wrong with the world and yet no formal inquiry has been ordered by
[12:49.200 --> 12:55.520]  the u.s government so i really don't know there's so many questions which hang in the balance and
[12:55.520 --> 13:02.640]  then to top it all they say that atah muhammad who took training on a light aircraft in miami
[13:02.640 --> 13:09.840]  six or six months he could have maneuvered a jumbo uh seven four five seven five seven
[13:09.840 --> 13:17.360]  uh from a height where it was traveling uh the height was nine thousand and it came within
[13:17.360 --> 13:24.160]  seconds to a height of one thousand and then went straight into its target now this is not possible
[13:24.160 --> 13:30.480]  for a person who has been trained on a light aircraft to to be able to do this yes and then
[13:30.480 --> 13:36.400]  there's no mention of the second aircraft so there are number of things which remain unanswered yes
[13:36.400 --> 13:42.160]  whenever the journalists come and visit me here and i asked them these questions that why haven't
[13:42.160 --> 13:48.560]  you taken the answers about this they say that patriotic act comes in the way and we are not
[13:48.560 --> 13:54.800]  supposed to ask such questions general we are talking to general hamed gulb the former head
[13:54.800 --> 14:00.320]  of pakistani isi during the key period fighting the russians he was also before he was the head
[14:00.320 --> 14:06.240]  of isi one of the chiefs according to our media running operations against the russians and of
[14:06.240 --> 14:11.040]  course working with the united states closely as well as the saudi arabians uh in the british
[14:11.040 --> 14:17.600]  uh and if that's incorrect correct me general uh gul um what are the motives we have pinak with
[14:17.600 --> 14:23.600]  dick cheney saying they need a pearl harbor event we have 44 000 us troops mashing into jikestan
[14:23.600 --> 14:30.480]  and ushbekistan in the days before 9 11 we have bush on september 10th newsweek reported ordering
[14:30.480 --> 14:36.000]  uh the uh launch of attacks the next week uh we have of course the buildings being blown up
[14:36.000 --> 14:42.080]  with explosives and all of the witnesses to that uh now the government admits that building 7 did fall
[14:42.080 --> 14:49.040]  in freefall was not hit by a plane specifically sir motives why would the military industrial
[14:49.040 --> 14:56.160]  complex controlling the united states uh why would they stage a 9 11 attack well i think
[14:56.160 --> 15:05.520]  uh after the cold war when uh the ergonomics it was known as the inflation was very high and the
[15:05.520 --> 15:12.000]  domestic issues had to be addressed but uh bill clinton two ten years they really amassed a lot
[15:12.000 --> 15:20.000]  of money american economy went booming and he left a lot of money and the the hard-boiled cold warriors
[15:20.000 --> 15:26.080]  when they came in they found that the situation was ready they had money and they had resources
[15:26.080 --> 15:33.280]  and they looked upon now the conquest of the world uh for which there was an opportunity window
[15:33.280 --> 15:40.320]  the muslim world was lying cross-state russia was not still picking up from the foreign position
[15:40.320 --> 15:46.240]  china was not ready yet and therefore they looked upon it as an opportunity to go and
[15:46.240 --> 15:52.640]  do the following and in this i'm a soldier and i know that there has to be a single aim but they
[15:52.640 --> 15:58.400]  mixed up the aims and they have bought up everything first they said that they would go into such
[15:58.400 --> 16:05.280]  strategic areas where there was no u.s presence before and such as the western asia and south asia
[16:05.280 --> 16:12.160]  south asia where there was no american physical presence and they wanted it there they had to
[16:12.160 --> 16:19.520]  keep the chinese off from getting into the middle east they had to lay their hands on the energy
[16:19.520 --> 16:25.120]  tap of the world which presently lies in the middle east but in future it will be in central asia
[16:25.120 --> 16:33.280]  and so vanistan is the gateway to central asia and finally to suppress any resistance particularly
[16:33.280 --> 16:39.200]  which could threaten the state of israel now that is where they instead of pursuing the american
[16:39.200 --> 16:45.040]  objective they started pursuing the israeli objective and that is where they went wrong
[16:45.040 --> 16:51.200]  you have to pick up a single aim this is the first principle of war and i don't know why the
[16:51.200 --> 16:57.920]  generals and the politicians of america they could be so naive and so ignorant that they started
[16:57.920 --> 17:08.400]  mixing aims and they went into this war without wisdom without particular preparation and without
[17:08.400 --> 17:14.400]  the american support behind them because if they had gone to vote and asked for support from the
[17:14.400 --> 17:20.240]  american people they would have never given this support so they had to create a pretext and this
[17:20.240 --> 17:24.400]  was the pretext that they created general we're going to break in a moment and come back with
[17:24.400 --> 17:28.000]  a final segment perhaps i can get you to stay a little bit longer because i want you to be able
[17:28.000 --> 17:33.280]  to speak unedited to the american people and the people of the world i want to shift gears into

[23:35.440 --> 23:42.640]  December 9th 2008 General Hamid Ghul one of the most famous members of commanders of Pakistani
[23:42.640 --> 23:47.600]  intelligence who worked in with the United States and the whole operation against the Russians
[23:47.600 --> 23:54.880]  was the commander of those operations is our guest with us graciously until 40 after general not
[23:54.880 --> 24:02.160]  wasting any more time I listed earlier the fact that Indian intelligence captains in the army have
[24:02.160 --> 24:08.400]  been caught in India staging bombings that's Indian news that Indian intelligence and police
[24:08.400 --> 24:14.960]  have been caught giving cell phones to the supposed shooters the police stood down and only the
[24:14.960 --> 24:20.560]  anti-terror commanders that had said that India was staging terror they were killed in the initiation
[24:20.560 --> 24:26.560]  of the attacks in Mumbai that some of the evidence of Mumbai being an inside job namely why do you
[24:26.560 --> 24:34.720]  believe Mumbai is a staged event two weeks ago a and b what is the motive well the motive is very
[24:34.720 --> 24:42.560]  simple that Americans want Indians to come on board with them in their war against terror especially
[24:42.560 --> 24:48.640]  when they run out of troops in Afghanistan the NATO allies are pulling out they are dragging
[24:48.640 --> 24:54.720]  their feet they're not prepared to fight there but they want to make it an Indian call and
[24:54.720 --> 25:03.600]  and they want nearly 150,000 troops in Afghanistan that is one reason where there is an American
[25:03.600 --> 25:11.120]  motive there is an Israel motive which is similar that the Americans should not pull out of Afghanistan
[25:11.760 --> 25:18.240]  just because they are sort of troops so they must have more troops there because if they go away
[25:18.240 --> 25:26.000]  without denuclearizing Pakistan state of Israel will remain in under perpetual danger so they have
[25:26.000 --> 25:32.240]  an innate fear that Americans may lose heart and pull out of this region they are already going
[25:32.240 --> 25:40.800]  out of Iraq and if they were to go out of Afghanistan as well this will be an unfinished agenda and
[25:40.800 --> 25:48.800]  that Israel would be at the losing end so the neocons and the Zionists they together want to
[25:48.800 --> 25:57.040]  hatch a conspiracy so that Obama gets trapped into a situation where for next four years he'll
[25:57.040 --> 26:03.040]  keep on sorting out this embryo as far as the ability is concerned which is the other element
[26:04.000 --> 26:10.400]  can you imagine that people traveling from Karachi in two rickety boats they can travel
[26:10.400 --> 26:16.720]  all the way to Bombay and then going to action immediately and fight a battle for 72 hours
[26:16.720 --> 26:22.560]  and they are just 10 of them and in each group there were two this is impossible they were
[26:22.560 --> 26:28.560]  carrying so much of munitions with them and that that munitions lasted they were fighting virtually
[26:28.560 --> 26:36.800]  the crack troops of the Indian army for so long and you know that in Narima house the five Jewish
[26:36.800 --> 26:42.800]  hostages they were killed by the Indian commandos they were not killed by these people so why would
[26:42.800 --> 26:48.080]  the Indian commandos kill them and israeli suppressed this information it initially
[26:48.880 --> 26:56.560]  came out in one of the Indian israeli delis but then it was suppressed so if you go by the record
[26:56.560 --> 27:04.960]  of the Indian acquisitions against Pakistan in the past in year 2001 on December 13 there was
[27:04.960 --> 27:10.480]  an attack on the Indian Lok Sabha and they blamed Pakistan and Lashwari Taiba for it but it turned
[27:10.480 --> 27:17.440]  out that these were Indian Kashmiris themselves and because India is committing so much of atrocities
[27:17.440 --> 27:24.160]  in Kashmir therefore there's a good reason for them that they would carry out something like that
[27:24.160 --> 27:30.880]  then they again in 2006 there was this Punjata express case in which 68 passengers mostly
[27:30.880 --> 27:38.880]  Pakistanis were killed and this train was stopped at an obscure railway station in Haryana and then
[27:38.880 --> 27:44.720]  those were locked and the train was set on fire and again this was the claim that it was Pakistani
[27:44.720 --> 27:51.600]  Lashwari Taiba and that they had done it because they wanted to derail the peace process but now
[27:52.640 --> 27:59.840]  three countries has been caught in it and there are other Indian officers who were his accomplices
[27:59.840 --> 28:08.080]  and he has a big network they took the RDX from Diolali depot which is a military depot
[28:08.080 --> 28:14.720]  so one can say that there is a deep penetration of the militant Hindus in military and intelligence
[28:14.720 --> 28:21.360]  organization in India so in this case why would they not do that because they want to again derail
[28:21.360 --> 28:27.680]  this process and when Obama says that he will mediate on Kashmir and there is a Kashmiri
[28:27.680 --> 28:36.080]  political movement picking up momentum and in this situation he said that he would send the
[28:36.080 --> 28:42.240]  Bill Clinton as the mediator obviously the militants in India do not want this to happen
[28:42.240 --> 28:49.120]  and they had to preempt it so Pakistan doesn't gain the Pakistani ISI doesn't gain anything from it
[28:49.120 --> 28:55.520]  the net beneficiary is either the militant Hindus stay there sir we have to break we have to break
[28:55.520 --> 29:05.520]  on the next election we're on the march the empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[32:18.720 --> 32:33.120]  well ladies and gentlemen a rare interview extremely enlightening we're talking to the former head of
[32:33.120 --> 32:39.200]  pakistani intelligence the isi i want to thank paul watson who's got my line is going to pop
[32:39.200 --> 32:43.920]  him with a question or two i want to thank us simon over in the uk for getting us this number
[32:43.920 --> 32:48.480]  and i want to thank erin for staying up late last night to get the producing job done to get this
[32:48.480 --> 32:55.680]  interview right here on the gcm radio network uh general continuing with motive i have the
[32:55.680 --> 33:02.080]  headline here pakistan asserts hoax war call was real press minister fingers india high commission
[33:02.080 --> 33:08.640]  as sorts of reports um that threatening sell call was fake as you know this is in most of the major
[33:08.640 --> 33:14.400]  pakistani papers the government has the caller id and the phone records that the threatening call
[33:14.400 --> 33:20.400]  saying that india was going to uh attack uh within minutes of the terrorist attacks beginning in
[33:20.400 --> 33:25.760]  mumbai a few weeks ago this provocative call within minutes saying india was going to attack
[33:25.760 --> 33:31.360]  pakistan attempting to get pakistan i guess to move trips to the border and have a conflict and
[33:31.920 --> 33:37.520]  the media is saying that a possible war between the two thermal nuclear powers was narrowly
[33:37.520 --> 33:44.560]  averted can you speak to that yes indeed i think the americans were there and the indians both have
[33:44.560 --> 33:51.440]  been very responsible about it because kondalisa rise's statement in america in india when he went
[33:51.440 --> 33:58.160]  and visited delhi they were very threatening towards pakistan and it was sort of a dictation
[33:58.160 --> 34:07.040]  that you have to satisfy india now this is amazing that pakistan had to satisfy india on what score
[34:07.040 --> 34:12.560]  indians are still to come out with the evidence and as far as this one man that they have caught who
[34:12.560 --> 34:19.120]  knows that this is not a bogey and that this man was loitering around somewhere there are lots of
[34:19.120 --> 34:24.800]  pakistanis who crossed the border illegally or legally and he could have been picked up and
[34:24.800 --> 34:31.360]  they he's become the frontman for singing all those stories so one doesn't really know it's too
[34:31.360 --> 34:37.840]  early to start threatening war against pakistan because pakistan is a nuclear country and if they
[34:37.840 --> 34:44.160]  brandish their power conventional power then i can assure you that as a soldier i will say that
[34:44.720 --> 34:51.760]  a conventional war limited war within the nuclear environment is not possible in the subcontinent
[34:51.760 --> 34:58.640]  and if if if it comes to exchange of nuclear weapons then this becomes a third world war china
[34:58.640 --> 35:05.840]  cannot stay out russia will not stay out russia is already showing its diligence towards america
[35:05.840 --> 35:12.480]  and europe and china of course is a very major economic power they are a nuclear power and
[35:13.200 --> 35:18.480]  if this thing happens in their backyards they will not accept it so this is a very dangerous
[35:18.480 --> 35:26.880]  situation i think it's playing with the file so the the whole thing is getting could get out of
[35:26.880 --> 35:36.320]  hand it is again as i told you that the part of the unfinished agenda that new cons had in their
[35:36.320 --> 35:42.000]  mind and they think that now obama will carry it out even though the americans want to change
[35:42.640 --> 35:50.080]  but let's look at what change means obama has not very clearly enunciated what change would be
[35:50.080 --> 35:56.560]  but one can assume that change means focusing on the domestic issues there is an economic meltdown
[35:56.560 --> 36:02.000]  the car industry is going thick and many other things are happening inside america the social
[36:02.000 --> 36:09.680]  welfare and the medicare etc so in all these things there is a need for the new administration to
[36:09.680 --> 36:14.480]  focus entirely on the domestic issues well general and for that it will have to distinguish
[36:14.480 --> 36:21.280]  externally general as you know in the last three months before obama was even elected he said pakistan
[36:21.280 --> 36:29.120]  and afghanistan would be his main focus the strikes inside pakistan it's clear that his change means
[36:29.120 --> 36:35.120]  what the big brazinski wants shifting what what the ran corporation has said they want
[36:35.120 --> 36:41.600]  shifting the war out of the middle east into central asia so i believe the change is going
[36:41.600 --> 36:46.960]  to be these provocations look at the neo cons with israeli and nato back forces launching
[36:46.960 --> 36:55.360]  the sneak attack on the russian held south oceania on 888 so it appears that they are trying to launch
[36:55.360 --> 37:02.400]  a major larger than a theater war as the ran corporation said a month ago they want a major
[37:02.400 --> 37:09.840]  new war yes indeed you're right because this is old theory which is your strategic theory put out
[37:09.840 --> 37:16.560]  first by mckendor and then by mahan who was an admiral in the u.s navy that this is the rimland
[37:16.560 --> 37:23.520]  you have to first control the rimland in asia before you can strike in the heartland of asia so
[37:23.520 --> 37:30.560]  this heartland rimland thing i think it fits into the story it fits into the picture that if they
[37:30.560 --> 37:37.360]  have a conflict in the rimland and they can control it and then it becomes so much easier to go and
[37:37.360 --> 37:46.560]  penetrate into the heartland but this is really asking too much yet at a state when america is
[37:46.560 --> 37:53.280]  not in a very healthy economic condition so i think this is the brinkmanship of the highest order
[37:53.840 --> 38:00.400]  and if they enlarge the area of conflict in this war against terrorism and if they prolong the
[38:00.400 --> 38:06.960]  period of conflict then america will definitely lose general because i know that when you are
[38:06.960 --> 38:12.880]  fighting the irregular fighters when area of conflict is enlarged let's say it's extended
[38:12.880 --> 38:19.600]  into the tribal areas of pakistan or it is pushed into kashmir as well so that china can be monitored
[38:19.600 --> 38:26.160]  and watched quite easily then the area will become larger and the u.s does simply does not have the
[38:26.160 --> 38:32.640]  truth and there is not a moral cause strong enough for the american people to be mobilized behind it
[38:32.640 --> 38:38.720]  so that's why this is here madness to be thinking of fighting at this time so that's why they need
[38:38.720 --> 38:44.000]  proxies like india to destabilize the region for the encirclement of russia and of course china
[38:44.000 --> 38:50.080]  blocking uh those pipelines now sir in the time we've got left uh you worked with the united states
[38:50.080 --> 38:57.280]  and saudi arabia with israel or at least pakistan did fighting the russian invasion uh of course uh
[38:57.280 --> 39:01.840]  if these reports are incorrect correct me but you were one of the main uh commanders helping the
[39:01.840 --> 39:06.400]  mujahideen then you were the head of pakistani intelligence uh right at the time that you finally
[39:06.400 --> 39:12.880]  had the victory uh against the russians uh it is reported here that al qaeda was founded by the new
[39:12.880 --> 39:18.640]  secretary of defense gates since the big rosinski uh or that they were the wahhabist fighting corps
[39:19.440 --> 39:24.960]  and that they are now being used to try to bring down uh the pakistani government and the stage
[39:24.960 --> 39:32.320]  attacks uh inside uh uh india uh so can you speak with your particular expertise to that
[39:32.320 --> 39:38.560]  and then also the fact that they're trying to now list you as a terrorist and then thirdly uh did
[39:38.560 --> 39:43.760]  did you ever meet osama bin laden is osama bin laden dead many years ago of kidney failure has
[39:43.760 --> 39:50.720]  been as our budo said well uh i was actually in charge of operations against the Soviet occupation
[39:50.720 --> 39:57.920]  of Afghanistan and the american were providing the logistics support and uh so these were
[39:57.920 --> 40:04.320]  sharing one half of the budget for this war and it was a cheap war because in all uh there was
[40:04.320 --> 40:10.560]  the 10 years that we were fighting the russians we spent not more than five five billion dollars
[40:10.560 --> 40:16.320]  out of the american expected so it was a very cheap war for for the american to have defeated
[40:16.320 --> 40:23.200]  the russians and uh read the whole of the west of this red man that they used to call
[40:23.840 --> 40:32.160]  so at that time osama bin laden and his uh colleague they were admired and they were
[40:32.160 --> 40:38.640]  romanticized by the cia operators i had never met him then i had nothing to do with him
[40:38.640 --> 40:44.320]  because i was only busy training the afans we had to win a war we had a task on our hand it
[40:44.320 --> 40:51.760]  was a very big task and we were so occupied with the training only the afans no other national
[40:51.760 --> 40:58.240]  was trained by the isi i can vouch on that not a single person not even a pakistani was trained
[40:58.240 --> 41:05.680]  by them osama bin laden was uh you know i had never met him but to the uh these people you
[41:05.680 --> 41:12.720]  have to come and talk blowingly about him i met osama bin laden after my retirement from the army
[41:12.720 --> 41:21.760]  in 1993 december in khartoum and then again in year 1994 november when i was when i was there
[41:21.760 --> 41:29.040]  invited by asin bin torabi to an international conference and during that conference osama
[41:29.040 --> 41:35.920]  invited us to a banquet and it was all in an open place and where there were many other people
[41:35.920 --> 41:43.040]  present i he stuck to me as a very normal human being not a blood thirsty animal that is being
[41:43.040 --> 41:50.080]  presented by the cia now uh at that time the no conversation between him and me took place
[41:50.080 --> 41:58.000]  i don't know whether he's living or dead but so far amin amin zoeri has been giving uh
[41:58.000 --> 42:04.000]  representing him in various interviews of osama that have been put out so one doesn't really know
[42:04.000 --> 42:11.040]  but the last interview which was a voice interview uh in that to the cia and the other
[42:11.040 --> 42:17.840]  u.s intelligence agencies authenticated that it was osama's voice so one doesn't really know whether
[42:17.840 --> 42:24.480]  he's living or dead well sir but uh even if he's not living he's now a symbol al qaeda is a franchise
[42:24.480 --> 42:31.120]  whoever created that and for whatever reason they created i think it wasn't there until 1996 when he
[42:31.120 --> 42:38.400]  was uh lodged in khartoum later on he was invited by uh bruharuddin rabani who is now part of the
[42:38.400 --> 42:44.080]  northern alliance in kabul and he came over and he set up his headquarters in a place called torah
[42:44.080 --> 42:51.120]  borah near jalalabad but uh that's where one started hearing of al qaeda and the activities
[42:51.760 --> 42:58.000]  of osama bin ladhan and also of the fact that his commander was responsible for being bringing
[42:58.000 --> 43:06.320]  the blackout talk down the first operation uh in mogadishu uh where uh uh an american aircraft
[43:06.320 --> 43:12.800]  was brought down by a stinger uh which had probably been supplied in afghanistan to afghan
[43:12.800 --> 43:17.520]  mojahedin okay general general i need to in the time we have left here because we've only got a
[43:17.520 --> 43:20.880]  few minutes left with you here maybe five minutes and we're going to break and i don't want to keep
[43:20.880 --> 43:26.400]  you any longer we can perhaps have you back up in the future specifically though we know his cia control
[43:26.400 --> 43:31.520]  name was tim osman we know he was the bag man for a lot of the saudi money and the israeli money
[43:31.520 --> 43:35.280]  going in i know that was compartmentalized and separate from pakistani intelligence
[43:35.280 --> 43:40.560]  from what i've read from different perspectives and u.s intelligence so so i believe you there
[43:40.560 --> 43:46.640]  my whole point here is is that clearly al qaeda al ciaida didn't carry out the attacks of 9 11
[43:46.640 --> 43:51.920]  as you yourself uh have said and bin ladhan in his first interview said that he didn't do it
[43:51.920 --> 43:56.560]  then they produced these computer morphed videos and fake audios that have been checked
[43:56.560 --> 44:02.880]  and the intel center headed up by rumsfeld's uh former lieutenant uh the private group was caught
[44:02.880 --> 44:08.480]  putting the same uh video layer in with the original video so it's been proven that they're
[44:08.480 --> 44:16.960]  creating uh these fake videos there is no doubt about it that this video which was put out in
[44:16.960 --> 44:23.920]  november by george bush and and said this was usama bin ladhan he was a high cheek bone uh like the
[44:23.920 --> 44:30.800]  mongolite features he wasn't as tall as usama bin ladhan was and one could make clearly make out
[44:30.800 --> 44:37.920]  that this was doctored this had been created on purpose just to uh justify the attack on
[44:37.920 --> 44:44.160]  afghanistan uh i think there are many things which are going wrong or being done on the
[44:44.160 --> 44:50.080]  behalf of the government by the cia which are not correct cia used to be good when they were
[44:50.080 --> 44:55.280]  working with us but i don't know what happened thereafter i think it is their overarching
[44:55.280 --> 45:03.280]  ambition or it is their fear that america would lose its clout whatever the reason or it is perhaps
[45:03.280 --> 45:10.720]  the israeli fear that they are surrounded by a sea of hostile enemies who could if the americans
[45:10.720 --> 45:18.160]  don't know uh at this point in time they don't deliver a fatal blow to all their enemies than
[45:18.160 --> 45:24.560]  israel people who have a short shelf life otherwise also because it is an artificial state
[45:24.560 --> 45:31.040]  that they would probably not exist or they would have general as you know they have in the time
[45:31.040 --> 45:37.280]  we have left they have over 400 nukes they have total dominance no one could attack them with nukes
[45:37.280 --> 45:42.000]  they have the anti-missile defense systems i believe it's a red herring that they want to
[45:42.000 --> 45:47.200]  start world war three uh for their quote safety it's world war three that will destroy israel
[45:49.040 --> 45:56.000]  uh yes indeed and i think this 2006 september experience i think if it is any indicator for
[45:56.000 --> 46:02.400]  them when they went into southern lebanon and they got such a buffeting at the ends of his vulla
[46:02.400 --> 46:09.600]  i i think that they're not uh uh do something like that because it would mean an annihilation of
[46:09.600 --> 46:15.920]  israel and in any case this palestinian question is a very thorny question and i don't know why
[46:15.920 --> 46:21.120]  the u.s administration is not addressing it differently okay instead of these two different
[46:21.120 --> 46:27.040]  state there should be one abrahamic state of palestine general because all the three religion
[46:27.040 --> 46:33.840]  which have uh which claim that they are divine religion they have their origin in in uh in
[46:33.840 --> 46:40.480]  palestine and i think uh something new has been has to be thought about all right but unfortunately
[46:40.480 --> 46:48.560]  bush administration in its very at the advent of it tenor it said that they would sort out this
[46:48.560 --> 46:54.640]  palestinian issue by creating two states all right after eight years we are we have gotten
[46:54.640 --> 46:58.720]  nowhere at all all right general well we're almost out of time two final questions and i'm
[46:58.720 --> 47:04.160]  going to let you go and you can uh any websites any books any materials you'd like to point people
[47:04.160 --> 47:08.080]  uh to see your side of the story we'd love to see it two questions let me give them both to you
[47:08.080 --> 47:13.920]  and then answer them please number one why are they trying to now list you as a terrorist a
[47:13.920 --> 47:18.960]  when they admittedly worked with you b and why do they always betray people like saddam who they
[47:18.960 --> 47:26.080]  worked with and set up so so a why are they trying to now set you up b where do you see the pakistan
[47:26.080 --> 47:35.520]  india situation going do you see the west staging more terror yes i i think they are simply afraid
[47:35.520 --> 47:41.200]  of me because i work with them i understand them i can measure them up and i talk loudly about it
[47:41.200 --> 47:48.400]  i make no words i feel full full no punches and they are afraid that i preempt whatever
[47:48.400 --> 47:56.960]  scheming they do and uh uh i am loud voice there is no doubt about it and i speak the truth they
[47:56.960 --> 48:03.920]  are trying to frame me there is no truth in it if they had anything about me when i applied for a
[48:03.920 --> 48:09.120]  renewal of my visa to america why did they not give it to me because if they have something
[48:09.120 --> 48:14.960]  they are looking around for terrorists why this terrorist wants to come over and visit america
[48:14.960 --> 48:21.440]  nab me interrogate me take me to task take me to court do whatever you like it only shows that
[48:21.440 --> 48:28.400]  they have a malafi d as far as saddam was concerned this is their habit it is a very bad habit
[48:28.400 --> 48:35.280]  they cultivate friends who become like provisional sort of dictators and then they make use of them
[48:35.280 --> 48:42.880]  and then they turn upon them and in fact the nations suffer because of their policies and
[48:42.880 --> 48:47.120]  what was the last part of your question all right i'm going to be india pakistan relations
[48:47.120 --> 48:52.160]  sir hold on one moment general john hold on general general one moment so we have a few
[48:52.160 --> 48:56.320]  minutes left john skip this network break for stations i'm skipping because i'm going to let
[48:56.320 --> 48:59.760]  him go in three minutes i don't want to hold him any longer but i'm skipping this break
[48:59.760 --> 49:05.680]  because this is too newsworthy yes sir i'd like you to answer that question uh about
[49:05.680 --> 49:09.840]  what do you think knowing them working with the globalist the new world order in the past when
[49:09.840 --> 49:14.960]  it was still america before we were totally dominated what do you think their next moves
[49:14.960 --> 49:21.760]  are probably uh a most probable a and then finally uh the attacks against the government
[49:21.760 --> 49:29.040]  in pakistan uh using uh muslim fronts does that appear to be the west trying to destabilize your
[49:29.040 --> 49:33.680]  government they keep trying to kill the government they killed buddho they keep bombing government
[49:33.680 --> 49:39.280]  buildings they keep bombing hotels it appears the west is using false mujahideen to try to
[49:39.280 --> 49:45.520]  overthrow pakistan no benazir was not killed by any of the terrorist she was removed by americans
[49:45.520 --> 49:51.200]  because she had violated her agreement because they wanted to keep her with musher of dare and
[49:51.200 --> 49:58.560]  he slapped another marshal on pakistan so she had become rebellious and such a person who is
[49:58.560 --> 50:04.480]  a popular leader of a third world country who's the head of the largest political party a woman
[50:04.480 --> 50:10.320]  who they could not attack as fundamentalist because she was so westernized therefore it was
[50:10.320 --> 50:15.920]  very important for them to remove her because they have a mischievous plan which they want to put
[50:15.920 --> 50:23.440]  through so they have installed instead mr zardari whom they can blackmail very easily but have
[50:23.440 --> 50:29.520]  allowed him to keep the powers that of a dictator and in fact he is the one who is calling all the
[50:29.520 --> 50:39.360]  shots in pakistan so if at all pakistan is already destabilized politically our judicial
[50:39.360 --> 50:46.480]  institution simply does not exist because there is a judicial crisis recently the dethroned
[50:46.480 --> 50:51.200]  chief justice of pakistan yes who is staging who is staging the terror attacks because they're
[50:51.200 --> 50:55.200]  clearly aimed at the government or is that the government staging them as a pretext to crack
[50:55.200 --> 51:02.000]  down no no no this is because lal mastic was attacked and i think josh bush addressed his
[51:02.000 --> 51:07.920]  nation on radio immediately after that said this was part of our plan in war against terrorism
[51:07.920 --> 51:13.520]  because they were suspecting that pakistan army and the inter-services intelligence were not
[51:13.520 --> 51:19.360]  fully cooperating and they because they did not consider it was their war therefore they
[51:19.360 --> 51:25.760]  created this situation where the terrorist out of sheer revenge this is this is called pakhton
[51:25.760 --> 51:33.120]  wali this is a tradition it has nothing to do with the islam it is the afans were beholden to
[51:33.120 --> 51:40.160]  this tradition long before they became muslim and they are still carrying out when you take action
[51:40.160 --> 51:45.920]  against an afghan kill his daughter or his wife or his sister he will take revenge no doubt what
[51:45.920 --> 51:56.400]  happens then he does not behave like a muslim or any other entity so this is this was a thing which
[51:56.400 --> 52:03.920]  was created and of course pakistan is now in a very difficult position we only have a stable
[52:03.920 --> 52:10.640]  military institution which can control the condition and we have an isi and but the americans are
[52:10.640 --> 52:17.440]  almost every day attacking the isi and attacking the military saying that this is not under control
[52:17.440 --> 52:23.440]  of the political party sir political power sir general what is political power when parliament
[52:23.440 --> 52:29.440]  is signing cure it does not work it has no authority at all general going back to 911
[52:30.320 --> 52:35.680]  pakistani papers bbc reported new york times reported a hundred thousand dollars was
[52:35.680 --> 52:41.680]  reportedly wired by general memud Ahmed the head of pakistani intelligence to the lead hijacker who
[52:41.680 --> 52:47.200]  we know is a u.s. government decoy trained at us bases that's newsweek ap roiders general memud
[52:47.200 --> 52:52.160]  Ahmed do you believe he really was being controlled by the cia did he really wire a hundred thousand
[52:52.160 --> 52:59.120]  dollars to muhammad adam not at all my mood is a friend of mine i met him very recently in the hall
[52:59.120 --> 53:06.400]  and he categorically denies this i think this is all this information which have been adopted
[53:06.400 --> 53:12.480]  as a very sophisticated intelligence art so just to be clear we're going to let you go and we're
[53:12.480 --> 53:18.560]  very thankful and respectful of your time um you believe that the bombings and terror attacks and
[53:18.560 --> 53:23.840]  shootings that we've seen the last few months uh in pakistan are because the predator drones
[53:23.840 --> 53:28.720]  and helicopters are killing weddings which you always notice it's a wedding that's meant to stir
[53:28.720 --> 53:34.080]  up the people there because it kills whole families it's a huge insult and then of course they blow
[53:34.080 --> 53:39.120]  up nato cars of course they then attack the government is that what you're saying this is
[53:39.120 --> 53:45.280]  retaliatory and david retaliate i can tell you that the one-time nation is packed that over
[53:45.280 --> 53:52.000]  five thousand years nobody has won against them and i think the american cannot win unless american
[53:52.000 --> 53:59.040]  intention is to to stir up a third world war from this point i think there is no point in staying
[53:59.040 --> 54:04.560]  in the in afghanistan you should negotiate with the opposition which is a national resistance
[54:04.560 --> 54:12.160]  law it is no longer paliban specific it is the afghan nation approved to their traditions they
[54:12.160 --> 54:19.680]  are resisting ferociously the general how long can the mayor of kabul stay in power and and isn't
[54:19.680 --> 54:25.120]  this really just about the west controlling the opium well he's a puppet of kabul and he will not
[54:25.120 --> 54:31.920]  stay very long i can assure you that uh he's already started showing signs of nervousness he
[54:31.920 --> 54:40.480]  wants to reach out to the taliban but taliban would not uh even throw a crumb at him i can assure you
[54:40.480 --> 54:46.400]  the taliban or any other resistance fighters they don't have will have nothing to do with
[54:46.400 --> 54:52.400]  well reuters is reporting reuters is reporting as you know every major city is now encircled
[54:52.400 --> 54:59.680]  and only a few cities are controlled by uh the u.s force i have no idea but i think
[55:00.720 --> 55:08.400]  vibes have started coming out like uh robert kagan's article in washington post on december
[55:08.400 --> 55:18.720]  2nd uh it echoes what is the world at risk report uh it is similar they are focusing on pakistan
[55:18.720 --> 55:25.360]  because pakistan's nuclear capability is undigestible by state of israel and by india
[55:25.360 --> 55:33.840]  and therefore there is every possibility that pakistan becomes a target in closing in closing
[55:33.840 --> 55:38.560]  and this is it we appreciate all your time is worth this hour is over in two minutes sir
[55:38.560 --> 55:42.640]  what do you see happening i know you can't predict the future but do you see them staging a nuke
[55:42.640 --> 55:47.920]  attack do you see them staging more terror attacks do you see india sneak attacking uh do you see a
[55:47.920 --> 55:52.160]  more radical government coming in after the staged events what do you see happening bad
[55:52.160 --> 55:58.320]  case scenario no indians are not so stupid i i think they have seen through the game
[55:58.320 --> 56:04.160]  and the the leftist parties that is the left front they are called the communist parties in
[56:04.160 --> 56:14.720]  india are very strong india is slowly turning towards its own problem uh they they shine india
[56:14.720 --> 56:22.480]  shining india feel good india this is all make believe i can tell you that this is a propaganda
[56:22.480 --> 56:32.400]  hype about india india is in a miserable state uh their economy is also dwindling and 400 millions
[56:32.400 --> 56:38.720]  are living on less than one dollar a day and this is beginning to have effect because last year alone
[56:39.280 --> 56:48.960]  108 000 farmers of india committed suicide and this will not go on out of 608 districts of india
[56:48.960 --> 56:55.920]  231 are already in turmoil and mostly under the control of moist and the ductile light so they
[56:55.920 --> 57:03.760]  are collapsing yes so india itself has lots of problems of their own you're right the gmo cotton
[57:03.760 --> 57:08.960]  made them commit suicide because it destroyed their lives well general uh general hamid uh gull

[59:58.960 --> 1:00:03.680]  have been laudan i got most of my questions out i didn't get into how the fbi doesn't have been
[1:00:03.680 --> 1:00:08.640]  laudan on the most wanted list that was unedited live on air and i had paul watson waiting in the
[1:00:08.640 --> 1:00:14.240]  wings but it was uh you know uh ghoul was bringing out so much and never got to paul i knew he had
[1:00:14.240 --> 1:00:21.280]  some questions been holding for an hour uh but uh kind of the post game here uh paul what did you
[1:00:21.280 --> 1:00:28.320]  think of that well i think he spilled the beans on just about everything didn't he alec so i didn't
[1:00:28.320 --> 1:00:36.160]  expect him to be so explicit in uh you know going on record is saying that america was behind the
[1:00:36.160 --> 1:00:43.520]  boots or assassination the bin laudan tapes are staged obviously told cnn what he thought about
[1:00:43.520 --> 1:00:49.440]  nine eleven but they never gave him the time to go into detail about it which he did on this interview
[1:00:49.440 --> 1:00:57.360]  you and uh perhaps that's you know we've heard a few of the reasons today why the u.s. government
[1:00:57.360 --> 1:01:04.160]  is trying to put him on a terrorist list and get a u.n. security council to denounce him as a terrorist
[1:01:04.160 --> 1:01:09.200]  because he's certainly turning out to be somewhat of a thorn in the side after you know that's why
[1:01:09.200 --> 1:01:13.360]  he's spelling the beans for now because he knows if he gets it all out there's no reason to go after
[1:01:13.360 --> 1:01:21.360]  him that could be it i mean obviously he's been accused of doing everything under the sun he's
[1:01:21.360 --> 1:01:28.640]  accused of being the uh the mastermind of the um group the pakistani terror group that've been
[1:01:28.640 --> 1:01:35.920]  blamed for mum by um he's been accused of creating the taliban he was accused of being the man in
[1:01:35.920 --> 1:01:42.240]  1998 who tipped off bin laudan that the u.s. were about to launch the missile strike on him because
[1:01:42.240 --> 1:01:50.720]  they tracked his satellite phone and then even in 2004 according to this um article out of india
[1:01:50.720 --> 1:01:58.000]  he was he was identified as being bin laudan's master planner behind 9 11 so he's been accused
[1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:03.120]  of just about doing everything obviously denying it well he made norad stand down and made the
[1:02:03.120 --> 1:02:09.120]  u.s. troops mass around afghanistan and he made uh he made the u.s. embassies let the supposed hijackers
[1:02:09.120 --> 1:02:14.320]  back into the country according to reuters in newsweek now it was our government our illegitimate
[1:02:14.320 --> 1:02:20.960]  criminal government right so he's obviously fallen out of favor with them and now because he did work
[1:02:20.960 --> 1:02:25.360]  with them at one point with the mujahideen in the end well i talked about how they set up saddam
[1:02:25.360 --> 1:02:30.000]  i'm not saying he's a good guy i'm not saying any of these guys are great guys the point is the u.s.
[1:02:30.000 --> 1:02:35.360]  works with them or creates them and then stabs them in the back exactly which seems like it's
[1:02:35.360 --> 1:02:41.680]  happening to him now with the uh even though he's he's publicly said that he will go to the u.n.
[1:02:41.680 --> 1:02:47.680]  and uh quote present himself for inquisition before a u.n. commission to clear himself
[1:02:47.680 --> 1:02:52.320]  of charges the add links to al qaeda and the salavan though he's fully prepared to do that
[1:02:52.880 --> 1:02:56.320]  and uh i don't think they'll let him do it though because it'll only give him another
[1:02:56.320 --> 1:03:00.880]  opportunity to have a public platform well i put the question to him about bin laudan
[1:03:00.880 --> 1:03:04.640]  and i mean he's a former intelligence chief i'm sure he wasn't saying everything and there
[1:03:04.640 --> 1:03:08.000]  might have been some deception in there no doubt that protect himself but
[1:03:08.560 --> 1:03:12.640]  now we know what the record is and uh we know they did keep the operation departmentalized
[1:03:12.640 --> 1:03:16.640]  with the saudi side the british side the u.s. side and the main side with pakistan
[1:03:17.200 --> 1:03:23.120]  directly funneling the weapons in but then the cia did a lot of the training uh just an amazing
[1:03:23.120 --> 1:03:28.320]  interview paul i mean how do you put all that into one article i hope you and steven everybody
[1:03:28.320 --> 1:03:33.520]  else curtain demo we need stories on all of this paul this was just absolutely amazing i'm glad
[1:03:33.520 --> 1:03:39.360]  your source in london uh simon gave us just a phone number to get a hold of his son and uh
[1:03:40.080 --> 1:03:50.880]  just just a blockbuster interview exactly it was absolutely blockbuster i want you to stay there
[1:03:50.880 --> 1:03:56.240]  though i want to shift gears just for five more minutes with you the major british newspaper
[1:03:57.120 --> 1:04:02.720]  has come out and admitted world government is being shut up okay this is this is in everybody's
[1:04:02.720 --> 1:04:05.680]  face and now for world government is the headline
[1:04:08.400 --> 1:04:12.320]  hello friends this is alex jones i've told you for a long time it's important to be
[1:04:12.320 --> 1:04:16.560]  self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever we need to be independent and food
[1:04:16.560 --> 1:04:21.040]  and water is the key you'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread you'll
[1:04:21.040 --> 1:04:25.760]  never have to go to the superdome and beg for female to take care of your family in any emergency
[1:04:25.760 --> 1:04:30.240]  if you simply prepare our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout for the special
[1:04:30.240 --> 1:04:34.560]  interest so they ignored your screams not to do it they turned off the telephones and email
[1:04:34.560 --> 1:04:40.240]  they voted to print 850 billion dollars at least out of thin air this money now owns the american
[1:04:40.240 --> 1:04:45.280]  and european banks the exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to
[1:04:45.280 --> 1:04:50.480]  nothing and blast the cost of necessities particularly food beyond many americans reach
[1:04:50.480 --> 1:04:55.840]  in pre-nazi germany super inflation the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days until it reached
[1:04:55.840 --> 1:05:01.600]  over four billion marks food prices are skyrocketing so fast there seems as if there may be no end in
[1:05:01.600 --> 1:05:06.400]  sight the private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money
[1:05:06.400 --> 1:05:11.360]  to restock their shelves the stores have less food but jack up prices to stay in business whatever
[1:05:11.360 --> 1:05:16.400]  happens in america we need to be prepared and be ready everything is zeroing in on food one third
[1:05:16.400 --> 1:05:21.200]  of americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities my friends whatever
[1:05:21.200 --> 1:05:26.080]  it takes get prepared get self-sufficient get food for everybody out there listening it's very
[1:05:26.080 --> 1:05:29.840]  important for you to understand that by having a supply of storable food the government the new
[1:05:29.840 --> 1:05:34.800]  old order has a lot less control over you and so it's a mindset a mindset of self-sufficiency
[1:05:34.800 --> 1:05:39.040]  and preparedness no one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you

[1:07:20.240 --> 1:07:25.840]  ladies and gentlemen on the heels of the cnn interview where they heavily edited him
[1:07:27.120 --> 1:07:31.040]  and we're just bringing you both sides here and and i agree with the information he's bringing
[1:07:31.040 --> 1:07:35.680]  out because it fits with all the evidence and the investigations we've done on each and every
[1:07:35.680 --> 1:07:41.440]  one of these cases the globalist operations their past operations and currently what's
[1:07:41.440 --> 1:07:45.920]  happening so they've had army captains army kernels this is in the indian news everything
[1:07:45.920 --> 1:07:52.160]  he was saying is in the news in india and he's right when he said india has now woken up and
[1:07:52.160 --> 1:07:56.240]  for a few days they were like yes attack attack india now they're going wait a minute and they're
[1:07:56.240 --> 1:08:03.680]  finding out it was staged now here in the united states they're not but um just absolutely amazing

[1:12:34.800 --> 1:12:40.560]  dollar piece of equipment can't buy them used so new that if the internet streams go down being
[1:12:40.560 --> 1:12:46.960]  fed by our t ones or cable modems or dsl which happens all the time when we refeed the stream
[1:12:47.760 --> 1:12:51.600]  this piece of equipment automatically flips over to another channel without you ever even knowing
[1:12:52.160 --> 1:12:57.680]  that's where the funds go and we could do a lot more if we had more funds we are blowing through
[1:12:57.680 --> 1:13:02.400]  the ron paul money i think i've spent about a hundred and sixty grand of that so far with
[1:13:02.400 --> 1:13:08.480]  the new office and we haven't even hired new people yet and then i've got to get it on dish
[1:13:08.480 --> 1:13:13.760]  network or direct tv i'm working on prices there you've got to buy the time if you're like us
[1:13:13.760 --> 1:13:18.960]  to do a once a week hour show if that works i'll do five days a week i mean you know we're really

[1:13:23.920 --> 1:13:29.680]  money bomb which was not my idea folks just did it so i got behind it uh but uh i've learned in
[1:13:29.680 --> 1:13:33.680]  this fight i'm not ashamed to ask for capital because what we can do with that seed money is
[1:13:33.680 --> 1:13:37.920]  absolutely amazing and we bring in all these other groups and activist groups and then energize them
[1:13:37.920 --> 1:13:44.320]  with activist and capital thanks to you the best audience in the world okay enough for me going
[1:13:44.320 --> 1:13:49.120]  on that three or four minute uh diatribe i want to talk to paul for the rest of this segment and
[1:13:49.120 --> 1:13:53.760]  then we're going to shift gears to children being kidnapped and and dying in foster care i see these
[1:13:53.760 --> 1:14:01.840]  articles every day and now for a world government this is the financial times of london the most
[1:14:01.840 --> 1:14:07.520]  perspective newspaper in the world the real paper of record where they do throw it in your face
[1:14:08.160 --> 1:14:14.720]  is the financial times of london whereas other papers are 90 spend in lies or they'll tell you
[1:14:14.720 --> 1:14:18.720]  the truth but then say it's a good thing the financial times of london will throw it in your
[1:14:18.720 --> 1:14:22.960]  face they admitted three years ago they were going to implode the small banks and insurance
[1:14:22.960 --> 1:14:27.200]  companies cut off liquidity to the world and then the banks were going to set up world government
[1:14:27.200 --> 1:14:32.480]  they admitted uh a year and a half ago that they were going to call it a bailout that would really
[1:14:32.480 --> 1:14:39.600]  be a takeover well and now for a world government and it's an article up on prismplanet.com we're
[1:14:39.600 --> 1:14:44.160]  linking to the article itself and paul watson did a boil down of it financial times a tutorial
[1:14:44.160 --> 1:14:49.520]  admits agenda for dictatorial world government and it says in the article the article says we
[1:14:49.520 --> 1:14:54.640]  need world government because of terrorism financial collapse all of this and they don't tell you that
[1:14:54.640 --> 1:14:58.960]  the globalists are staging that but they admit it's going to be dictatorial it's going to be a
[1:14:58.960 --> 1:15:05.280]  world dictatorship but that that's what we need and it admits the major players have been secretly
[1:15:05.280 --> 1:15:11.040]  working for decades to set up world government run for and by the banks you will pay carbon taxes to
[1:15:11.040 --> 1:15:15.920]  them it's all there and it links to reports that go into more detail now are you going to hear rush
[1:15:15.920 --> 1:15:20.800]  limbaugh are you going to hear shan hanity are you going to hear any of these people no they're
[1:15:20.800 --> 1:15:26.240]  going to keep saying it doesn't exist because they have to neutralize conservatives liberals have
[1:15:26.240 --> 1:15:31.040]  been taught world government's good and sold on the kool-aid okay world social estate they're
[1:15:31.040 --> 1:15:36.400]  starting to wake up to conservatives are who have to be manipulated and if oxy cottonhead ever told
[1:15:36.400 --> 1:15:43.600]  the truth he'd be off the air so that's why he won't folks they'll have a world emperor in 20 years
[1:15:43.600 --> 1:15:49.040]  and they'll be saying it doesn't exist okay uh paul watson this is incredible but i mean we've seen
[1:15:49.040 --> 1:15:52.960]  thousands of articles the last two months admitting new world order world government but this is
[1:15:52.960 --> 1:16:00.000]  admitting it's dictatorial it's incredible paul that's right there was one about a week ago called
[1:16:00.000 --> 1:16:07.280]  obama's new world order which was roughly around the same principle but yeah this is an editorial
[1:16:07.280 --> 1:16:15.840]  by gideon rachman who is the uh chief foreign affairs correspondent of financial times which
[1:16:15.840 --> 1:16:22.000]  of course is staffed by top bilderberg as they're always represented at bilderberg in particular
[1:16:22.000 --> 1:16:29.280]  by martin wolf the associate editor so it's the it's the establishment newspaper it's the newspaper
[1:16:29.280 --> 1:16:34.160]  of the elite yeah it's not the new york times it's about to go bankrupt by the way having
[1:16:34.160 --> 1:16:39.760]  the mortgage it's a building to stay in business over 200 and something mill this this is it and
[1:16:39.760 --> 1:16:45.360]  again i'm we can't live in the dial anymore folks all of you out there stop acting like
[1:16:45.360 --> 1:16:52.080]  children and denying this paul well that's right i mean you were called a nutcase throughout the 90s
[1:16:52.080 --> 1:16:57.840]  other people have been called similar for decades the warning that we were moving towards the
[1:16:57.840 --> 1:17:03.920]  centralized global government and this article lays it all out and admits it and the telling
[1:17:03.920 --> 1:17:12.000]  thing about it is that it says that a system of world government basically will only be successful
[1:17:12.000 --> 1:17:18.320]  if it's anti-democratic because it makes reference to the uh expansion of the EU and the fact that
[1:17:18.320 --> 1:17:24.000]  every time they put the expansion of the EU to a vote just like in island recently and they're
[1:17:24.000 --> 1:17:28.080]  trying to get that pushed through again you know if they just vote no they just have another vote
[1:17:28.080 --> 1:17:34.800]  the people always reject it because they hate it and they know it's anti-democratic and by the way
[1:17:34.800 --> 1:17:40.160]  despite the media universally hailing it it failed uh in ireland this year they're already bringing
[1:17:40.160 --> 1:17:44.800]  it back up to another vote yeah they just keep having another vote until they say yes they just
[1:17:44.800 --> 1:17:50.720]  keep beating it into people and this article admits that the only way this global government
[1:17:50.720 --> 1:17:55.680]  is going to be successful is if it's anti-democratic and dictatorial well i mean the pentagon the
[1:17:55.680 --> 1:18:00.480]  ministry of defense all say that that's what nafta gatt we're now 15 years into that look what it's
[1:18:00.480 --> 1:18:05.680]  done to us uh they don't care they're doing it and the yuppies have been taught that world
[1:18:05.680 --> 1:18:10.880]  government doesn't exist so they walk around reading their luxury clothing catalogs sucking

[1:24:03.040 --> 1:24:08.000]  challenging limba challenging hanity you know and and like post 20 or 30 mainstream articles
[1:24:08.000 --> 1:24:11.840]  with government leaders and politicians calling for world government saying new world order
[1:24:11.840 --> 1:24:16.400]  means global government and they still have all these think tanks and talk show host saying
[1:24:16.400 --> 1:24:20.560]  there's no new world order it doesn't mean world government when they admit it means that
[1:24:20.560 --> 1:24:23.280]  i mean we were right about how they were going to put troops on the streets we were right about
[1:24:23.280 --> 1:24:27.920]  getting rid of the governors in in in emergencies we were right about posi common taught ascending
[1:24:27.920 --> 1:24:31.760]  we were right about them imploding the economy we i mean we are right about everything because
[1:24:31.760 --> 1:24:37.200]  we're reading the white papers we're reading what they say and and and and literally you've
[1:24:37.200 --> 1:24:42.320]  got the governor now arrested by the fbi up in uh illinois three months ago he announces
[1:24:42.320 --> 1:24:46.880]  they're using national guard door to door confiscating guns and cities where they're banned
[1:24:46.880 --> 1:24:52.720]  and it doesn't even make news i mean they just though i saw a story out of atlantic city where
[1:24:52.720 --> 1:24:57.200]  the whole government's corrupt and it was admitting that it's just all total criminality i mean
[1:24:57.200 --> 1:25:01.600]  everything's falling apart paul and i know it's bad in england they're now are the police
[1:25:02.240 --> 1:25:07.440]  knocked into a 70-something-year-old guy with a cigarette no criminal record a wealthy guy
[1:25:07.440 --> 1:25:11.440]  they knocked the cigarette out of his hand this is in the glove and mail today and said
[1:25:11.440 --> 1:25:17.200]  oh you littered and then gave him a hundred and thirty dollar fine uh 60 pounds fine i mean
[1:25:17.200 --> 1:25:23.120]  it's just government is just rampaging with evil right now every parasite every nim with
[1:25:23.120 --> 1:25:31.040]  every every scumbag is joining it go ahead that's right but the people are still in denial
[1:25:31.040 --> 1:25:36.320]  even though today it's right out in the open in the financial times with this article
[1:25:36.320 --> 1:25:43.120]  it's editorial and now for a world government the key quote in it is quote international
[1:25:43.120 --> 1:25:50.160]  governance tends to be effective only when it is anti-democratic so there it is right now right
[1:25:50.160 --> 1:25:55.440]  there it's saying it has to be dictatorial to have any kind of success the one thing that we
[1:25:55.440 --> 1:26:01.040]  make reference to quite often is that whenever these elitists or these globalists are confronted
[1:26:01.040 --> 1:26:06.240]  by people who say you want to create a new world order which is essentially a global
[1:26:06.240 --> 1:26:12.160]  centralized government unrepresentative of people and the antagonistic to any form of
[1:26:12.160 --> 1:26:15.920]  democracy it's a world dictatorship by the financial elite and ever rockerfellers words
[1:26:16.960 --> 1:26:22.960]  but they say it's not global government it's global governance as if there's any difference
[1:26:22.960 --> 1:26:29.440]  well in this article it admits that fact that global governance is just a euphemism for global
[1:26:29.440 --> 1:26:34.800]  government well in the in the dictionary it means the system of government so it means
[1:26:34.800 --> 1:26:40.560]  government or to govern i mean that's how it's disdain for the public they openly set up world
[1:26:40.560 --> 1:26:44.960]  government i mean texas isn't even run by the state anymore it's all international run they're
[1:26:44.960 --> 1:26:50.000]  grabbing the power plants the roads federalizing and then handing that over all our ports are
[1:26:50.000 --> 1:26:54.240]  being handed over nationwide they're buying this it's over and we could turn it around it's all
[1:26:54.240 --> 1:27:00.960]  illegitimate but they tell the public oh honey it doesn't exist i mean total disdain for the public
[1:27:00.960 --> 1:27:06.560]  well this is what's admitted to in this article it says they they have to use soothing language to
[1:27:06.560 --> 1:27:13.520]  prevent people from from reaching for their rifles in america's talk radio heartland that's
[1:27:13.520 --> 1:27:19.840]  direct quote and then he then he quotes jack at harley he was an advisor to president nicolard
[1:27:19.840 --> 1:27:26.400]  sarcosia france who argues that quote global governance is just a euphemism for global government
[1:27:26.400 --> 1:27:31.760]  see see see they won our guns the financial times the foreign international affairs editor
[1:27:32.480 --> 1:27:38.720]  they're openly saying they are neutralizing you with soothing language through rush limbaugh
[1:27:38.720 --> 1:27:41.200]  laughing none of it exists this is high treason
[1:27:41.200 --> 1:27:52.480]  Paul it's incredible great job my friend great job on the article okay good job we're gonna cover

[1:35:51.840 --> 1:35:58.160]  and then actually changing their dna and shriveling their testicles down to nothing
[1:36:00.560 --> 1:36:05.520]  and attacking the ovaries of the mice and rats and then when the higher ups she's all freaked out
[1:36:05.520 --> 1:36:10.800]  about it and they call her aside and they say don't worry we need to there's too many people we
[1:36:10.800 --> 1:36:14.720]  need to sterilize everybody and then these yuppies go well there are too many people
[1:36:15.280 --> 1:36:19.360]  because they've been trained that's trendy to talk about okay well you go look at the African
[1:36:19.360 --> 1:36:24.560]  kids or the kids on your street dying of cancer that they're being shot up with and the gmo causes

[1:36:31.040 --> 1:36:35.200]  i mean i remember going back a year and a half ago people walking me on the street or i get emails
[1:36:35.200 --> 1:36:39.760]  or i'd be trying to warn people at church or you know wherever i'd say you know they're
[1:36:39.760 --> 1:36:43.760]  imploding the economy by design it's gonna get really bad the stock market's gonna drop by thousands
[1:36:43.760 --> 1:36:47.680]  thousands of points and they're gonna rob the pension funds they go i don't care i don't know
[1:36:47.680 --> 1:36:53.440]  any stock everyone's designed now conditioned to not care about anybody but themselves when you care
[1:36:53.440 --> 1:36:59.200]  about nobody you fall apart when you care about nobody you lose control you become a slave nobody
[1:36:59.200 --> 1:37:07.120]  cares about you you understand that that you got to put the big boy pants on and live in the real
[1:37:07.120 --> 1:37:13.360]  world and get out of your diapers the corruption is it cute and funny it runs wild like cancer
[1:37:13.360 --> 1:37:18.720]  or like a staph infection a flesh-eating bacteria you understand
[1:37:21.360 --> 1:37:25.600]  stock market plunging affects everybody because it affects companies that capitalize and fund
[1:37:25.600 --> 1:37:31.600]  their expansion and operation and payroll with it it affects everybody it affects the company
[1:37:31.600 --> 1:37:35.840]  you work at even if you don't own stock it affects everybody that does business with those companies
[1:37:35.840 --> 1:37:43.280]  but you laugh about it it's all funny you've been trained to be self-assured foolish people
[1:37:44.400 --> 1:37:49.520]  stop being arrogant stop being so self-satisfied stop thinking everything's okay
[1:37:49.520 --> 1:37:54.080]  admit there's world government admit classical tyranny is coming in admit and you're like i
[1:37:54.080 --> 1:37:58.000]  don't care i've done nothing wrong i like troops on the streets i hope they arrest you they're in

[1:38:08.800 --> 1:38:15.120]  space and their troops or their bureaucrats or their nihilistic punk rockers or whatever they are
[1:38:15.120 --> 1:38:21.440]  it's always different groups don't you understand that tyranny is for you they want the tyranny to
[1:38:21.440 --> 1:38:26.960]  lower your standard of living they want the tyranny to hurt the society but again these people are
[1:38:26.960 --> 1:38:34.880]  such cowards they psychologically subconsciously decide to join with the evil rather than fight it
[1:38:34.640 --> 1:38:41.120]  okay because it's so scary to admit this is going on they go okay it's real and i like it okay i like
[1:38:41.120 --> 1:38:47.440]  it well your enemies of the republic your enemies of humanity and you will be defeated you understand
[1:38:49.520 --> 1:38:53.200]  you will be defeated you understand that we aren't gonna stop and we aren't gonna back off
[1:38:53.200 --> 1:38:58.240]  and we aren't gonna quit we've been right about everything and a lot of you're laughing a lot
[1:38:58.240 --> 1:39:03.040]  of you'll be crying later you're still living in mommy's house you're still in the military
[1:39:03.040 --> 1:39:07.760]  or do you still think everything's okay you're gonna find out you're gonna find out it's not
[1:39:07.760 --> 1:39:13.360]  funny evil's not funny wickedness and torture isn't funny it's gonna come back on you 10 times
[1:39:13.360 --> 1:39:19.360]  what you dealt out all right for the balance of this hour we're joined by mr pound
[1:39:19.360 --> 1:39:25.760]  Greg pound and and and Greg recap in about three or four minutes what happened to you what's happening
[1:39:25.760 --> 1:39:30.640]  in florida in this latest case and i know you follow this every day i read about foster children
[1:39:30.640 --> 1:39:35.120]  found starving to death or dead in cages because that's normal standard they put them in cages
[1:39:35.120 --> 1:39:38.800]  i'd say about a third of the time they starve them to death they don't feed them they're drowning
[1:39:38.800 --> 1:39:42.880]  every day uh they don't have to follow any rules they have swimming pools the foster things the kids
[1:39:42.880 --> 1:39:48.240]  drowning not even a fence around it cps won't enforce against their own foster kids uh foster
[1:39:48.240 --> 1:39:51.360]  parents because they want to cover it up then there's the facilities that are even worse
[1:39:51.360 --> 1:39:56.400]  where all the pedophiles go and work and just nothing happens when all this goes on and then
[1:39:56.400 --> 1:40:01.520]  now i played last week a clip of the head of foster care in an oklahoma area going children
[1:40:01.520 --> 1:40:07.120]  will die so what yeah they'll die they're five times more likely to die in their custody
[1:40:07.760 --> 1:40:13.440]  justice department so numbers and there's a new case here a boy in foster care has a really
[1:40:13.440 --> 1:40:18.240]  brain damaged and in most news reports they never mentioned but every time i hear about a kid in a
[1:40:18.240 --> 1:40:23.760]  cage or kid starving i'll hear the the media announced again 99 percent of the time oh see
[1:40:23.760 --> 1:40:29.600]  foster care needs more funding cps needs more funding family services even more funding and
[1:40:29.600 --> 1:40:34.080]  then you go dig deeper into the other stories about it you'll always find it's foster care
[1:40:34.080 --> 1:40:39.360]  it's the government so they hurt the children that advertise that its parents and then get more
[1:40:39.360 --> 1:40:45.040]  money there's no end to their wickedness greg pound tell us all about it well alex thank you for

[1:41:29.200 --> 1:41:33.040]  get into the current story you said you want to come on about bro see the current story is simple
[1:41:33.040 --> 1:41:37.360]  that i heard your program here a week ago and you were talking about you had someone on there
[1:41:37.360 --> 1:41:41.840]  that you were interviewing who said to you that children are going to die and you were pounding
[1:41:41.840 --> 1:41:46.640]  them out about the issue and then the next day in the paper comes out the issue of this child
[1:41:46.640 --> 1:41:53.040]  that was only a year a year and a half old taken from the parents stuck in foster care the foster
[1:41:53.040 --> 1:41:58.320]  parents told them listen we we need help we've got too many kids they're scared they're grabbing
[1:41:58.320 --> 1:42:02.560]  so many kids they're sticking them in the foster care places the people can't deal with it they
[1:42:02.560 --> 1:42:06.480]  told them to come and get the child these two children that they dropped off said listen we
[1:42:06.480 --> 1:42:12.080]  can't deal with them we we need you to take these kids and and they they never came out they left
[1:42:12.080 --> 1:42:16.640]  them in the one and and they and they shook the child until the child was brain they murdered
[1:42:16.640 --> 1:42:22.320]  children to 24 seven and nothing stops them and now they go john pull that clip up where the head
[1:42:22.320 --> 1:42:27.200]  of cps says children will die just the way it is that's exactly the right that was the clip that i
[1:42:27.200 --> 1:42:32.880]  heard and so what happens is our case manager who stole our kids illegally now bv bent has
[1:42:32.880 --> 1:42:39.520]  a degree in law and government and in our whole church we you know alex we could never deal with
[1:42:39.520 --> 1:42:44.240]  the hell that that the cpi child protection investigations what they're doing to florida
[1:42:44.240 --> 1:42:49.520]  what they did to our family trying to break us down we're in panellas county where terry schivel
[1:42:49.520 --> 1:42:54.560]  was started that and these people are they think they can do whatever they want so it's bv bent
[1:42:54.560 --> 1:43:00.240]  fighting this oh yeah it's our it's the whole church our whole congregation has supported us
[1:43:00.240 --> 1:43:05.760]  through this and once you hear him talk and explain to you i mean i mean and he and his whole
[1:43:05.760 --> 1:43:08.640]  family's involved i'm gonna hold you over a little bit in the next hour if you can do it
[1:43:08.640 --> 1:43:12.960]  since we got you on light and call jesse trying to tell him i'm gonna get him on 15 after john
[1:43:13.920 --> 1:43:18.720]  okay here is the clip uh we're only gonna play part of this i can't stand listening to it
[1:43:18.720 --> 1:43:23.600]  they snatched the lady's child for some dirty plates we've contacted her and others that's why
[1:43:23.600 --> 1:43:27.440]  they were taken the little girls taken for dirty plates in the house they tricked their way in
[1:43:28.160 --> 1:43:32.320]  any dog hair anything they're gone and they take them to these filth pets where they're killed
[1:43:32.320 --> 1:43:39.040]  here it is children will die whether they're in foster care or whether they're in their own
[1:43:39.040 --> 1:43:46.480]  relatives care children will die strong words from dhs after the deaths of two children thanks
[1:43:46.480 --> 1:43:50.640]  for choosing i witness to use five at five i'm naggy carlo good evening everyone i'm jessica
[1:43:50.640 --> 1:43:57.200]  shambach two-year-old skydon word died sunday tonight her death and the death of another child
[1:43:57.200 --> 1:44:03.040]  over the weekend are raising questions about how dhs keeps kids safe while they're in foster
[1:44:03.040 --> 1:44:08.080]  care and i witness use five's amanda gary joins us now and amanda you talked to dhs today and what
[1:44:08.080 --> 1:44:13.520]  they told you don't write shocking yeah i was shocking because the dhs spokesman like you
[1:44:13.520 --> 1:44:19.120]  heard told me children will die no matter if it's in their own home or in foster care
[1:44:19.120 --> 1:44:25.920]  she was just beautiful i mean two-year-old skydon word drowned at this foster home in
[1:44:25.920 --> 1:44:32.080]  chikashay sunday it's not the only foster care death over the weekend in ardemore 19-month-old
[1:44:32.080 --> 1:44:39.200]  ray palmer died when a car backed over him plus dhs now faces a lawsuit from a tulsa family
[1:44:39.200 --> 1:44:45.520]  they claim this foster parent william hunter jr and appropriately touched his foster son
[1:44:45.520 --> 1:44:51.600]  so today we went to dhs to ask them what they think about these recent cases so do you think
[1:44:51.600 --> 1:44:59.360]  something different will have to happen now i don't think so why not because children will die
[1:44:59.360 --> 1:45:03.680]  whether they're in foster care or whether they're in their own relatives all right that's enough
[1:45:03.680 --> 1:45:08.240]  of that punk so the point is they can kill your children five times more likely than any other
[1:45:08.240 --> 1:45:13.120]  group most dangerous place to be they can kill your children all day long and there's no investigation
[1:45:13.120 --> 1:45:18.560]  no changes they're above the law they are god incarnate the death will continue this was only
[1:45:18.560 --> 1:45:24.320]  one oklahoma town i mean just deaths every day in austin deaths everywhere the murder spree continues
[1:45:25.040 --> 1:45:30.560]  the child molesters want a child they go become foster parents and then and then and then and then
[1:45:30.560 --> 1:45:36.160]  the cps will not investigate because they will not investigate themselves so the smart pedophiles
[1:45:36.160 --> 1:45:40.320]  don't stand outside schoolyards they become foster parents and the raping operation begins
[1:45:40.320 --> 1:45:45.760]  uh now again i'm running on here uh bb bent you're welcome to comment go ahead bruce
[1:45:48.000 --> 1:45:52.320]  bruce i'm just sharing dead air space no you're here go ahead go ahead
[1:45:54.560 --> 1:46:00.560]  okay gregg alex yes sir go ahead sorry sir um i was just hearing dead air i lost
[1:46:00.560 --> 1:46:05.840]  you're on air right now go ahead mr bent i want to uh your listeners know the things that you've
[1:46:05.840 --> 1:46:10.800]  been telling people about what's going on around the country are dead on they're not just happening
[1:46:10.800 --> 1:46:17.200]  here in florida but it is the program a federal program and the monies that are allotted to the
[1:46:17.200 --> 1:46:23.920]  states are dependent upon their participation in the program uh we have documentation to show that
[1:46:23.920 --> 1:46:30.240]  the not only are the federal agencies of the executive department involved but because of
[1:46:30.240 --> 1:46:37.440]  that the state agencies are involved under the same guys and that uh the courts are involved by
[1:46:37.440 --> 1:46:43.440]  contract to as collection agencies for these agencies they actually have signed contracts
[1:46:43.440 --> 1:46:49.120]  between the judges and the agencies um as collection servants for that the other thing
[1:46:49.120 --> 1:46:54.320]  that you mentioned that was so right on is the fact that the majority of this is coming to us
[1:46:54.320 --> 1:47:01.520]  not by our elected officials through the congress this has been suspended since uh 1933 hour under
[1:47:01.520 --> 1:47:07.840]  emergency powers all of these things have been stopped most of our law now comes from executive
[1:47:07.840 --> 1:47:13.600]  order not from uh our legislature and the family services i even have a mainstream media clip
[1:47:13.600 --> 1:47:20.000]  today about it from mainstream television it was set up for eugenics and they would sterilize the
[1:47:20.000 --> 1:47:25.520]  poor children that's where cps was founded go ahead and you're absolutely right that those
[1:47:25.520 --> 1:47:33.040]  things are are very very much a present part of every everyday reality for so many thousands of
[1:47:33.040 --> 1:47:39.040]  families now across the country and a lot of it is as you said in florida specifically because
[1:47:39.040 --> 1:47:43.840]  that's where we live and what we're dealing with every day these things are done without the benefit
[1:47:43.840 --> 1:47:50.240]  of trial they're done behind the closed doors of a judge's chambers in a judge who is appointed
[1:47:50.240 --> 1:47:57.040]  over that specific area of law and who hears the cases and makes the decisions as rubber
[1:47:57.040 --> 1:48:03.680]  stamping the agency what is brought children have children have less rights than taliban at camp x
[1:48:03.680 --> 1:48:10.240]  right you're absolutely right you know there's so many things that uh uh you know and and the
[1:48:10.240 --> 1:48:16.640]  thing that is it's done on to the idea that they're protecting child's right but in in reality it's
[1:48:16.640 --> 1:48:22.240]  the destruction of the family it's not the protection it's not the support of the parents
[1:48:22.240 --> 1:48:28.320]  in protecting the home and so forth which is supposed to be um and is that legislative to be
[1:48:28.320 --> 1:48:34.880]  the intent of the department is to protect and hold the family together and that the only time
[1:48:34.880 --> 1:48:41.600]  that the children are to be taken from the family is if in fact a crime has been committed and the
[1:48:41.600 --> 1:48:47.120]  probable cause statute in the state of florida for uh hearing for taking custody of children
[1:48:47.120 --> 1:48:53.280]  is based upon the fact that there has to be the probable cause standard for an arrest warrant
[1:48:53.280 --> 1:48:59.680]  but all of that is ignored system-wide and a racketeering conspiracy for federal funds on
[1:48:59.680 --> 1:49:06.400]  headhunting there are bounties on all your children these are commanded by pedophile rings it's been
[1:49:06.400 --> 1:49:12.400]  in the florida news at every director of the cps but for the last six years it turns out as a

[1:52:44.400 --> 1:52:49.040]  hurts my spirit because i know i've seen it i've been there when they're snatching the babies
[1:52:49.040 --> 1:52:53.040]  for no reason i've seen the people crying i've seen the pain i've seen the pedophile cops they
[1:52:53.040 --> 1:53:00.160]  have special cops they use smile with pleasure big fat nelly pieces of trash maggots suckers
[1:53:00.160 --> 1:53:06.000]  just a pit of hell demons i've seen the cps people waddling around they're all the same demons of
[1:53:06.000 --> 1:53:13.120]  hell literal scum bill is unimaginable everything i'm telling you is true folks they're just grabbing
[1:53:13.120 --> 1:53:17.840]  grabbing over a million children a year with wanton abandoned always advertising the worst
[1:53:17.840 --> 1:53:22.480]  cases with parents to demonize parents it's all part of eugenics i'm gonna hold you guys 15 minutes
[1:53:22.480 --> 1:53:30.400]  over the next hour you were getting a bb bent uh who um our guest uh greg pound that his children
[1:53:30.400 --> 1:53:35.840]  kidnapped years ago uh for no reason was a neighbor's dog but the child and they take
[1:53:35.840 --> 1:53:43.440]  her child for that uh they really hate christians uh greg pound uh i i thought that pound was coming
[1:53:43.440 --> 1:53:49.120]  on about this um this local florida case of the child dying i mean it's always or the or the child
[1:53:49.120 --> 1:53:53.600]  being brain damaged or children dying so i think it's important to personalize these stories but
[1:53:53.600 --> 1:53:59.360]  yes mr bent uh getting into how there is no bill of rights or constitution for families and children
[1:53:59.360 --> 1:54:05.920]  go ahead well that's the thing that uh once once these things have been removed we have no way to
[1:54:05.920 --> 1:54:13.120]  safeguard um in florida even though our constitution mandates the right to trial by jury right to
[1:54:13.120 --> 1:54:19.520]  trial by juries denied and even though and our constitution here is even higher than the federal
[1:54:19.520 --> 1:54:25.360]  constitution which says that it shall be irrevocable and um in all cases you have the right to trial
[1:54:25.360 --> 1:54:33.200]  by jury but they sequester it into a private audience before a judge who just rubber stamps
[1:54:33.200 --> 1:54:39.600]  with greg's case particularly uh at the shelter hearing they would not the judge would not allow
[1:54:39.600 --> 1:54:46.800]  any testimony to be made on behalf of he or his family we were there sworn to testify and the judge
[1:54:46.800 --> 1:54:52.800]  would not hear any testimony and said i find probable cause bam that's the end of it and let's
[1:54:52.800 --> 1:54:58.560]  be clear let's be clear these are police officers posing as officers these are cps posing the judge
[1:54:58.560 --> 1:55:06.960]  is posing they're all illegally in a money deal sworn agents of the private adoption agencies
[1:55:06.960 --> 1:55:13.200]  and the government getting these bonuses so again it it's just a totally rogue criminal group
[1:55:14.640 --> 1:55:19.760]  that's not true when when we look when we think about the fact that these individuals and and
[1:55:19.760 --> 1:55:24.720]  most of them and i don't know that they're all malevolent malevolent in themselves from the
[1:55:24.720 --> 1:55:29.440]  beginning but a lot of them go into these things with good intentions and then they realize that
[1:55:29.440 --> 1:55:34.640]  their job is dependent upon getting more clients if they don't if they want to get promoted they've
[1:55:34.640 --> 1:55:39.040]  got to get a supervisor a position they've got to get people working under them now let me stop
[1:55:39.040 --> 1:55:47.680]  the idea i've got the statistics you can pull these up about 55 percent of cps workers it has
[1:55:47.680 --> 1:55:53.600]  the worst government rollover of any industry of any sector of government 50 quit because they're
[1:55:53.600 --> 1:55:59.120]  the good people who won't go within one year so they have the highest turnover and then all you
[1:55:59.120 --> 1:56:04.240]  get left with is mercenaries that just want the money and pedophiles that want to rape the children
[1:56:04.240 --> 1:56:10.160]  go ahead that's exactly right um you're you're left with people who are doing it because that's
[1:56:10.160 --> 1:56:16.400]  how they make their living and uh it's not this is not serving families this is not holding families
[1:56:16.400 --> 1:56:23.120]  together it's destroying families right and left it's armed pedophile mercenary forces ruling
[1:56:24.720 --> 1:56:30.880]  it's exactly right and there's there's no way to guard against it without a return to the fact
[1:56:30.880 --> 1:56:37.280]  of holding a people accountability to their oath that these people are supposed to be sworn servants
[1:56:37.280 --> 1:56:42.640]  of the people who are there to do only those things which they're allowed to do under the
[1:56:42.640 --> 1:56:48.160]  constitution the powers that we grant to them now stay there back in 70 seconds look i've got two
[1:56:48.160 --> 1:56:52.480]  mainstream news clips i saw last night where they're having to pay eugenics reparations

[2:05:50.880 --> 2:05:59.120]  w o a i investigation two years ago seven drugs on average totally healthy and uh but the majority
[2:05:59.120 --> 2:06:03.280]  the kids end up dying that they get majority don't end up dying a minority end up dying but the
[2:06:03.280 --> 2:06:09.120]  majority that do end up dying to be precise for some reason are black or their christian
[2:06:09.120 --> 2:06:14.560]  home schooling whites they leave a lot of the mexicans alone because mexicans are real human
[2:06:14.560 --> 2:06:19.200]  beings they haven't been dehumanized and turned into american slaves they will run with their
[2:06:19.200 --> 2:06:26.080]  children their children come first so i salute them i've seen all the statistics look bb bent
[2:06:26.080 --> 2:06:31.520]  mr pound see i go off on a jag here because of this subject you know people ask why i get
[2:06:31.520 --> 2:06:34.800]  so mad at the police the whole system i'm not saying all police the whole government's bad
[2:06:35.360 --> 2:06:39.840]  but they don't stop it where are the police protesting where are they saying no they don't
[2:06:39.840 --> 2:06:45.280]  want to be involved in all this where where are they the system is evil and i've had enough of it
[2:06:45.280 --> 2:06:49.200]  go ahead bb bent and greg palin you guys talk about whatever you want for the balance of this
[2:06:50.160 --> 2:06:55.520]  segment now we're absolutely right the thing that uh if we we've got to have people who will
[2:06:55.520 --> 2:07:00.400]  take a stand and say you know when i become a government servant i take a note to uphold and
[2:07:00.400 --> 2:07:05.120]  defend the constitution it's not just the supreme court it's every person who goes into government
[2:07:05.120 --> 2:07:10.240]  at whatever level not just federal government but any person who goes into government at whatever
[2:07:10.240 --> 2:07:14.800]  level has an obligation to uphold and defend the constitution that means they're not to
[2:07:14.800 --> 2:07:20.240]  exceed their authority that means they're not to go into areas where powers have not be granted
[2:07:20.240 --> 2:07:24.880]  that means that they're not supposed to do these things for money they're supposed to be
[2:07:24.880 --> 2:07:30.240]  representatives of the people and have no power greater than the individual our constitution
[2:07:30.240 --> 2:07:34.640]  the state of florida opens up by saying all political powers inherent in the people that
[2:07:34.640 --> 2:07:39.440]  means anybody in government does not have any greater power than any private citizen because
[2:07:39.440 --> 2:07:45.200]  they can't have power that we didn't give them but by force of arms they carry the day and by
[2:07:45.200 --> 2:07:50.560]  false authority it's yeah but it's only because we've been dumbed down to think that we don't
[2:07:50.560 --> 2:07:55.440]  have the right to keep them bare arms we don't only have the right we have the responsibility
[2:07:55.440 --> 2:08:00.000]  to see to it that we uphold and defend the constitution against all enemies foreign
[2:08:00.000 --> 2:08:05.120]  or domestic and this means that's where our protection is for limited government but even
[2:08:05.120 --> 2:08:10.640]  further than that it doesn't mean we're lawless it doesn't mean we're to go into anarchy it means
[2:08:10.640 --> 2:08:15.440]  just the other way around that the people were supreme the people were sovereign and that
[2:08:16.000 --> 2:08:20.720]  below once we had as you brought out they're going to hold their government responsible
[2:08:20.720 --> 2:08:25.360]  they were going to abolish it and create new forms and it is our responsibility and again
[2:08:25.360 --> 2:08:30.240]  i'll say to everybody in the cia and the fbi police bureaucrats all of you you know this stuff's
[2:08:30.240 --> 2:08:34.960]  going on you know i'm telling the truth you know so let me tell you something you either join us
[2:08:34.960 --> 2:08:39.600]  in just like dorge bush said but but it's actually true it's just that he was the terrorist so it
[2:08:39.600 --> 2:08:45.520]  was a reverse double entendre the point is you either join us and actively fight this or you
[2:08:45.520 --> 2:08:51.040]  are giving sanction to all of it and i beg you to search your heart and to join us in the fight
[2:08:51.040 --> 2:08:56.800]  against the new world order go ahead thank you alex man that that needs to be said over and over
[2:08:56.800 --> 2:09:02.720]  and over again to so many people because a lot of people feel like they don't have uh the ability
[2:09:02.720 --> 2:09:07.600]  to stand up they don't have the ability to be counted and every one of us every day makes choices
[2:09:07.600 --> 2:09:13.200]  that have to do with that and if you don't stand up and be counted then you're one of them and
[2:09:13.920 --> 2:09:21.600]  the day that we talk about is is me for everybody but me and so i have to realize that i have to
[2:09:21.600 --> 2:09:28.640]  hold myself accountable every day and everybody else who works in a position where um where we
[2:09:28.640 --> 2:09:34.640]  are the sovereigns in this country or we're under tyranny if there is no other choice so tell us some
[2:09:34.640 --> 2:09:38.880]  of the horror stories that are going on there in florida and some of the latest deaths and injuries
[2:09:39.600 --> 2:09:43.200]  one of the things you know and then greg has brought out the fact that and you brought out the
[2:09:43.200 --> 2:09:49.120]  fact already that his family he lost four children in his wife and that's been more than four years
[2:09:49.120 --> 2:09:53.920]  ago and the cps where they did it lost her job but they won't give the children back because they
[2:09:53.920 --> 2:09:58.640]  say oh we can't hurt the families that have your children now what about the biological parents
[2:09:58.640 --> 2:10:05.200]  and the children were old when they got grabbed absolutely and the the thing that is in this
[2:10:05.200 --> 2:10:10.160]  this woman who just recently that's a grandmother that you were opened up the program with this
[2:10:10.160 --> 2:10:15.520]  is a grandmother who wanted to take care of the kids even though her grandchildren even though
[2:10:15.520 --> 2:10:20.960]  there were problems within the family the whole idea of the agency was set up to support the family
[2:10:20.960 --> 2:10:26.880]  in holding themselves together to make the necessary food and and medical care instead of
[2:10:26.880 --> 2:10:33.360]  grandma getting the children who got them the state got them and now that child is in a vegetative
[2:10:33.360 --> 2:10:39.600]  state not because of the grandmother not because of any abuse because of the abuse brought upon
[2:10:39.600 --> 2:10:45.840]  by the state and this has been one case right after another um they hope they take children and they
[2:10:45.840 --> 2:10:50.560]  say that these children are underweight but the standard that they used to measure against the
[2:10:50.560 --> 2:10:56.800]  american medical association has already mentioned is based on obesity um they they say these children
[2:10:56.800 --> 2:11:00.720]  are underweight these kids were raised on health food these kids were raised that's the new thing
[2:11:00.720 --> 2:11:06.400]  they're grabbing they're grabbing uh organic uh folks children i've seen that hundreds of times
[2:11:06.400 --> 2:11:11.280]  and these are healthy rating and eyed children and they say if the child isn't obese then they've
[2:11:11.280 --> 2:11:15.680]  got to take them but then they reverse that they're also taking children now who are obese so they
[2:11:15.680 --> 2:11:21.440]  are again no reason they just take them and that's because there's no standard child abuse
[2:11:21.440 --> 2:11:27.280]  abandonment and neglect under chapter 39 in the florida statutes under the head dc the dcf
[2:11:27.280 --> 2:11:33.200]  department statutes is the fact that um if there's no definition it's not they're not holding to the
[2:11:33.200 --> 2:11:38.720]  criminal standard for abuse abandonment neglect they go with a uh a standard that is totally
[2:11:38.720 --> 2:11:43.040]  nebulous from letting your children watch too much children to not letting them watch children
[2:11:43.040 --> 2:11:49.920]  from you picking their friends to not and whereas they hold and and where as they hold parents to
[2:11:49.920 --> 2:11:55.920]  this maximum standard of a dirty plate a neighbor dog bite falling off the jungle gym with witnesses
[2:11:55.920 --> 2:12:00.320]  well it's your fault they fell off it's not normal for kids to have that happen uh even though it
[2:12:00.320 --> 2:12:04.880]  happened to all of us we're taking them then when they kill or abuse the children they won't
[2:12:04.880 --> 2:12:10.320]  investigate themselves and say well their deaths are just part of what we do yeah and that's a
[2:12:10.320 --> 2:12:16.160]  problem because most of our laws now exempt government from the very standards that they hold
[2:12:16.160 --> 2:12:20.720]  the people to if you look at building code statutes and other ones you'll walk in there and look at
[2:12:20.720 --> 2:12:25.120]  the exemptions you'll find that the agencies exempted themselves from the same standard
[2:12:25.120 --> 2:12:30.000]  government is now god and this is a perfect atmosphere for the worst elements to then
[2:12:30.000 --> 2:12:36.640]  migrate into government and and perfect a tyranny which is now happening that's exactly right our
[2:12:36.640 --> 2:12:42.320]  founding fathers did not hold this they held our government accountable to a higher standard the law
[2:12:42.320 --> 2:12:47.120]  of nature and of nature's god and they said that's why when america had our revolution wasn't like
[2:12:47.120 --> 2:12:51.840]  the french revolution we had an absolute law on which we could hold people accountable and we held
[2:12:51.840 --> 2:12:57.200]  ourselves accountable and we held the king accountable we separated from the king of england
[2:12:57.200 --> 2:13:04.720]  because he was no longer obedient to those laws and we it's come to a point where king george
[2:13:04.720 --> 2:13:12.640]  and king bill and the others have done the same thing there we're no longer holding them accountable
[2:13:12.640 --> 2:13:18.000]  to a higher law it says once you violate those standards you start abusing the family you start
[2:13:18.000 --> 2:13:23.840]  defy redefining family you start taking and splitting people up and so forth that's where
[2:13:23.840 --> 2:13:28.560]  they were supposed to honor the proper authority of father and mother and hold the family together
[2:13:28.560 --> 2:13:35.760]  hold marriage sacred hold these things that we held accountable and that's why we we had our
[2:13:35.760 --> 2:13:40.480]  inalienable rights didn't come from nowhere they came from the almighty and we knew what those
[2:13:40.480 --> 2:13:46.320]  rights were because he defined them in his law absolutely but bottom line here is they set up
[2:13:46.320 --> 2:13:54.800]  for eugenics in the 20s in the 1890s in england 1920s here a little bit earlier and i have the
[2:13:54.800 --> 2:13:59.680]  newsreels where they would kill the babies they'd come take your baby and kill it you know let it
[2:13:59.680 --> 2:14:05.760]  die they just uh they set it up for a few days in a freezing cold room that's what america does
[2:14:05.760 --> 2:14:12.080]  and so that's who founded cps as you just heard the local newscast earlier and so it's all going
[2:14:12.080 --> 2:14:17.120]  on right now they are not the moral authority they don't follow the bill of rights constitution
[2:14:17.120 --> 2:14:21.680]  the guantanamo bay people have more rights than they do i'd love to have you back on sometime

[2:22:13.120 --> 2:22:17.200]  i think that's the one thing we neglected to mention in the article we wrote he's got a huge

[2:22:29.120 --> 2:22:34.880]  get into more detail on every front and take your calls next hour on the uh false flag attack of
[2:22:34.880 --> 2:22:40.000]  Oklahoma city we have to continue to revisit all this as new developments come out uh so jesse
[2:22:40.000 --> 2:22:44.240]  trying to do a short segment now long segment coming up but it's good to have you back with us
[2:22:44.240 --> 2:22:49.920]  and why don't you recap what the basic facts well thank you for having me back mr jones
[2:22:49.920 --> 2:22:54.960]  you bet uh basically my brother was killed in the months following the Oklahoma city bombing
[2:22:54.960 --> 2:23:03.600]  he was killed in Oklahoma city he had been uh picked up in california and sent to Oklahoma
[2:23:03.600 --> 2:23:08.320]  city he'd gotten out of service and during the Vietnam war is a heroin addict and that wasn't
[2:23:08.320 --> 2:23:14.720]  uncommon back then um he had robbed a bank and he was caught and pled guilty he did his time
[2:23:15.280 --> 2:23:24.960]  he got out in 1988 married worked paid his taxes he got into a dispute with his probation officer
[2:23:24.960 --> 2:23:30.720]  who didn't like him drinking beer and so we fought that and he lost that fight and he just basically
[2:23:30.720 --> 2:23:34.480]  told his probation officer you know where i am and i'm gonna drink beer so come and give me if you
[2:23:34.480 --> 2:23:39.840]  want to well they're not going to go pick somebody up who's drinking beer and send them back to prison
[2:23:40.560 --> 2:23:47.040]  but he was picked up coming across the border his wife is an american citizen but they have family
[2:23:47.040 --> 2:23:55.760]  in mexico and in bahá california and sent to Oklahoma city and was dead two days later
[2:23:56.640 --> 2:24:03.120]  and at the time uh it was a shock to us that the government called up and the department of
[2:24:03.120 --> 2:24:08.160]  justice and said he committed suicide and they asked for permission to cremate his body and we
[2:24:08.160 --> 2:24:13.120]  said no and we found out later that after we said no the department of justice went to the
[2:24:13.120 --> 2:24:17.680]  Oklahoma state medical exam and tried to get an order for cremation and he wouldn't give it to him
[2:24:17.680 --> 2:24:23.520]  because he didn't have the family's permission it took us a week to get his body released and sent
[2:24:23.520 --> 2:24:28.240]  home and when he came home he was heavily made up and my mother and his wife and my sister
[2:24:28.240 --> 2:24:34.960]  stripped the makeup off and he'd been beaten head to toe his head was the skin and his head
[2:24:34.960 --> 2:24:39.760]  was split to the skull in three places from the blows uh soles of his feet had been beaten
[2:24:40.640 --> 2:24:48.880]  knuckles black beaten back and front and his throat was cut and then we found out he'd been
[2:24:48.880 --> 2:24:52.560]  strangled with a pair of plastic handcuffs so he'd apparently been tortured extensively
[2:24:52.560 --> 2:25:01.440]  and then killed uh we had no no and this happened in federal custody supposedly in a
[2:25:02.240 --> 2:25:06.880]  isolation interrogation type cell where only the department of justice has access to him
[2:25:08.080 --> 2:25:14.800]  and they of course said it's the suicide and the suicide by hanging uh it was a hard hard case for
[2:25:14.800 --> 2:25:20.000]  us i mean we we went to our government expecting them to do right we went to the fbi expecting
[2:25:20.000 --> 2:25:25.200]  them to do right but then we started to get suspicious when uh all the evidence disappeared
[2:25:25.760 --> 2:25:30.480]  the medical examiner shows up on the morning to claim my brother's body and before they turn
[2:25:30.480 --> 2:25:36.880]  his body over the department of justice removes his bloodstain clothing and destroys it the medical
[2:25:36.880 --> 2:25:42.640]  examiner tries to get access to the cell they tell him he can't and then they clean it that very day
[2:25:44.000 --> 2:25:49.440]  he comes back he finally got into the cell about six months later and they point to a note written
[2:25:49.440 --> 2:25:53.120]  on the wall now this is a sealed crime scene supposedly and they said that's a suicide note
[2:25:53.120 --> 2:25:57.760]  and he said well why don't you have your handwriting analyzed he comes back a week later and they'd
[2:25:57.760 --> 2:26:06.640]  painted the cell the surveillance camera supposedly malfunctioned i received a call from a a world
[2:26:06.640 --> 2:26:13.440]  expert on video cameras who had been the expert his name was uh pearl who had been the expert in
[2:26:13.440 --> 2:26:19.520]  the rodney king case he said the department of justice the fbi came to him with the video camera
[2:26:19.520 --> 2:26:24.000]  and wanted him to say that the tape the camera had malfunctioned he looked at the camera he
[2:26:24.000 --> 2:26:28.800]  looked at the tape and he said the tape had been erased and they immediately grabbed the
[2:26:28.800 --> 2:26:32.320]  camera back from him the tape back from him and tell him not to do anything not to write all
[2:26:32.320 --> 2:26:36.640]  right stay stay there we're gonna come back uh on the other side of this break and continue

[2:31:19.520 --> 2:31:25.520]  case just like all the guests i had on yesterday of a single person taking action they harassed
[2:31:25.520 --> 2:31:29.920]  his mother his father who were elderly basically caused them to die as he said last week guess

[2:31:44.080 --> 2:31:49.120]  what looks like burn marks electrical marks all over him bruises i mean black and blue head to toe
[2:31:49.120 --> 2:31:57.840]  both sides savagely savagely just tortured him to death trying to get info because the feds of
[2:31:57.840 --> 2:32:00.640]  course had just bombed their own building and thought it was one of the witnesses and had to
[2:32:00.640 --> 2:32:04.640]  get rid of john doe number two but he wasn't john doe number two we know who that know who that
[2:32:04.640 --> 2:32:09.440]  was they also murdered him police officers that were investigating this in Oklahoma were murdered
[2:32:10.320 --> 2:32:15.360]  cop of the year tortured to death similar to this just remember that police out there they got FBI
[2:32:15.360 --> 2:32:19.920]  hit teams that will torture you to death they'll kill anybody they want whenever they want they hire
[2:32:19.920 --> 2:32:24.480]  these former special forces guys that are mentally ill put them into the anti-terror squads and they
[2:32:24.480 --> 2:32:28.800]  like it they like being the bad guys they like getting away with it they like that nobody can
[2:32:28.800 --> 2:32:35.040]  stop them they love evil it's all about their own personal power now there's more of us than
[2:32:35.040 --> 2:32:39.360]  then we're going to combine forces there's good people in government like good FBI agents leaked
[2:32:39.360 --> 2:32:43.680]  documents that he later sued was able to get from the government because he had the documents to
[2:32:43.680 --> 2:32:48.800]  prove were accurate where they were basically running the bombing operation this is key info
[2:32:48.800 --> 2:32:53.760]  let's continue with jessie try to do who again took action and finally won in court what was at
[2:32:53.760 --> 2:33:00.320]  1.3 million or 1.2 million uh a little over a million mr. jones but to get right to the
[2:33:01.440 --> 2:33:06.320]  the heart of the story and it's interesting that you your comments about the murders because
[2:33:06.320 --> 2:33:11.200]  the world famous videographer he calls me and tells me the tape had been erased the FBI had
[2:33:11.200 --> 2:33:17.040]  taken the tape back from him and told him not to say anything about it before our trial he ends up
[2:33:17.040 --> 2:33:23.120]  dead a witness to my brother's murder named Alden gillis baker he's found hanging in his cell
[2:33:23.760 --> 2:33:28.960]  a month before the trials to start in federal custody uh the fellow that i think was john dot
[2:33:28.960 --> 2:33:34.800]  two richard league guthrie his unit said he supposedly hangs himself in federal custody
[2:33:34.800 --> 2:33:39.600]  the day before he supposedly is going to give a tell all interviews in the los angeles times about
[2:33:39.600 --> 2:33:44.480]  what he said will blow the lid off the oakland city bombing but the point on on all this evidence
[2:33:44.480 --> 2:33:49.520]  disappearing is we didn't understand why uh my brother we're just ordinary people why this is
[2:33:49.520 --> 2:33:55.440]  happening and we've gone to the FBI looking for them to do the right thing and uh i mean the crime
[2:33:55.440 --> 2:34:00.960]  scene photographs disappear while in fbi custody the the logbooks that would show who came in and
[2:34:00.960 --> 2:34:08.320]  had access to my brother they disappear everything disappeared uh we didn't have a motive uh the
[2:34:08.320 --> 2:34:12.400]  government harassed my mother and father they would go up and down the street and this is the FBI
[2:34:12.400 --> 2:34:21.040]  door to door asking neighbors for any kind of smut on my family of drug use criminal activity
[2:34:21.920 --> 2:34:27.600]  everything they tried and by the way you now have the emails where holder who's about me
[2:34:27.600 --> 2:34:32.880]  attorney general is saying this is a normandy level cover-up like the invasion of normandy on
[2:34:32.880 --> 2:34:38.720]  d-day so they're just everywhere full court press covering this up and i don't understand why i mean
[2:34:38.720 --> 2:34:45.120]  at that time uh they tried twice and died me my wife part of my brother's ashes i had a place
[2:34:45.120 --> 2:34:50.080]  together on the beach in mexico she had my my brother was killed his their only child was two
[2:34:50.080 --> 2:34:55.040]  months old she would go back and forth down to their their place on the beach and coming back
[2:34:55.040 --> 2:34:59.440]  across the border one time uh immigration officer pulled her over and said are you missus trinado
[2:34:59.440 --> 2:35:03.200]  and she said yes he said well you shouldn't go down the Mexico very much anymore and she
[2:35:03.200 --> 2:35:08.560]  said why he said the FBI has been here and they told us every time you come across to take you
[2:35:08.560 --> 2:35:13.200]  to what they call secondary now that's where they take the engine out of your car take the tires off
[2:35:13.200 --> 2:35:17.200]  take the steering wheel out the seats out and say have a nice day and walk away
[2:35:20.000 --> 2:35:24.480]  but again we never understood why this was happening because all we wanted to know was the
[2:35:24.480 --> 2:35:30.000]  truth what happened to my brother and why nobody was being prosecuted well then it started unravel
[2:35:30.000 --> 2:35:37.360]  about a short time afterwards when i received an anonymous call i think it was in january of 96
[2:35:37.360 --> 2:35:42.880]  it said the person said your brother had been killed by the FBI i remember the words vividly
[2:35:42.880 --> 2:35:48.400]  it was an interrogation that went bad and the person said your brother had fit a profile of
[2:35:48.400 --> 2:35:53.920]  this group that was robbing banks to get money to attack the federal government and i didn't
[2:35:53.920 --> 2:36:00.160]  pay any attention to it i thought it was a nut calling and then in june or july of 1996 i read a
[2:36:00.160 --> 2:36:04.960]  story in the los angeles times about a richard league guthrie who was a member of a group called
[2:36:04.960 --> 2:36:11.760]  the midwest bank robbery gang who was robbing banks and getting money to wage a war against the
[2:36:11.760 --> 2:36:16.800]  united states of government and i thought that was interesting but it never clicked really and then
[2:36:16.800 --> 2:36:24.160]  about shortly before he was executed i get a message from tim mcvay who said told me that
[2:36:24.960 --> 2:36:29.360]  when i saw your brother's picture and heard what happened to him i want you to know that the FBI
[2:36:29.360 --> 2:36:35.280]  killed him because they thought he was richard league guthrie and i guess what's really
[2:36:35.280 --> 2:36:41.360]  clued me into it was getting a felt telephone call from a reporter named jd cash out of oklahoma
[2:36:41.360 --> 2:36:49.680]  and jd had family and friends killed in the bombing he had pursued that story all those years this was
[2:36:49.680 --> 2:36:55.600]  in the spring i think of 2004 and he asked me if i had a minute to talk about my brother and i said
[2:36:55.600 --> 2:37:01.200]  yes and he said well describe your brother and i said he was five foot nine powerful upper body
[2:37:01.200 --> 2:37:05.520]  build dark complexed jd asked me before it was you when he was picked up and i said well he was
[2:37:05.520 --> 2:37:10.000]  coming back across the border from mexico and jd said well what was he driving and i said he was
[2:37:10.000 --> 2:37:15.600]  driving his friends 1986 chevrolet pickup truck and then jd asked the last question he said did he
[2:37:15.600 --> 2:37:21.360]  have any tattoos and i said yes he said what kind and where and i said he had a dragon tattoo on
[2:37:21.360 --> 2:37:29.280]  his left forearm jd lets out this this sound i mean i can't remember what it was it was like
[2:37:29.280 --> 2:37:34.960]  oh my god he said you better sit down i said well i am sitting down he said let me tell you this he
[2:37:34.960 --> 2:37:39.920]  said when your brother was picked up the largest manhunt in american history was going on for
[2:37:39.920 --> 2:37:46.720]  john doe too and this is the description white male five foot nine dark complexed powerful upper
[2:37:46.720 --> 2:37:53.600]  body build believed to be in canada mexico driving a 19 mid 1980s chevrolet pickup truck
[2:37:53.600 --> 2:37:58.640]  dragon tattoo left left forearm my brother comes across the border meeting that description
[2:37:58.640 --> 2:38:03.200]  in his cento gloman and dead two days later and then i brought a lawsuit
[2:38:03.200 --> 2:38:14.160]  uh i had been leaked to two teletypes from then fbi director louie free talking about this sting
[2:38:14.160 --> 2:38:20.240]  operation taking place in a white supremacist compound in eastern alcohoma called elohim city
[2:38:21.200 --> 2:38:25.760]  and it was apparent from that teletype that they had informants with these people
[2:38:25.760 --> 2:38:31.920]  and they were linked to the bombing and then i came across a reference to an fbi operation
[2:38:31.920 --> 2:38:41.440]  that started in the early 1990s 92 93 somewhere around there called pat con pat c o n it was an
[2:38:41.440 --> 2:38:48.960]  acronym for patriot conspiracy and apparently it was the fbi's operation to infiltrate the
[2:38:48.960 --> 2:38:54.720]  militia movement and to track them all over the country and so i filed a freedom of information
[2:38:54.720 --> 2:39:00.560]  act request i zeroed in on that sting operation at alliam city and i said i want all your documents
[2:39:00.560 --> 2:39:07.440]  it's linking that operation referring in that operation to the bombing alcohoma city tim mcvay
[2:39:07.440 --> 2:39:14.560]  richard league guthrie and the midwest bank robbery gang well i knew that that they would lie and
[2:39:14.560 --> 2:39:19.120]  of course they didn't they came back and said there were no documents and so i filed the two i had
[2:39:19.120 --> 2:39:24.000]  with the court and i knew they'd come back one of the things when you fight the fbi you can always
[2:39:24.000 --> 2:39:28.800]  count on the lie they'll lie when the truth would serve them better and that's a big advantage to
[2:39:28.800 --> 2:39:34.960]  have knowing that about your adversary so i had ready an affidavit from a retired fbi agent
[2:39:34.960 --> 2:39:39.120]  saying that the documents were legitimate so they sure enough they come back in the court and say
[2:39:39.120 --> 2:39:46.080]  the memos are fake i filed that the judge goes ballistic ordered them to go back and do a manual
[2:39:46.080 --> 2:39:54.000]  search and they come back with 150 some pages of records and they plead with the the judge
[2:39:54.000 --> 2:39:59.440]  not to turn them over to me because they said they had four or five informants who they had
[2:39:59.440 --> 2:40:05.360]  promised anonymity and if their names were to get out they would be placed at risk the judge said
[2:40:06.800 --> 2:40:12.400]  black the names out turn the documents over well i get these blacked out the i get the
[2:40:12.400 --> 2:40:16.640]  documents with the names blacked out but it's clear they had this operation up and running
[2:40:17.280 --> 2:40:23.600]  one of the teletypes has tim mcvay calling eliam city two days before the bombing asking for more
[2:40:23.600 --> 2:40:32.160]  help um evidence came out that that uh one of the informants had actually gone four months in
[2:40:32.160 --> 2:40:37.840]  october 94 to scout the murrow building with some of the participants and had reported it
[2:40:38.560 --> 2:40:42.080]  so they knew four months at least four months before it happened it was going to happen
[2:40:42.640 --> 2:40:47.520]  they had their informants robbing banks and armored cars with mcvay in the midwest bank
[2:40:47.520 --> 2:40:53.920]  roberts to get the money to build a bomb now now let me stop you there um going back because i remember
[2:40:57.920 --> 2:41:01.440]  colonel craig roberts and others have talked about how you were able to get the two memos and
[2:41:01.440 --> 2:41:06.320]  put them over each other you had the one that had been leaked but then you also had the other one
[2:41:06.960 --> 2:41:10.320]  they were able to get from the government you were able to learn quite a few of the names from that
[2:41:10.320 --> 2:41:19.920]  well not not the names but what was important is they they black they can't remember what they've
[2:41:19.920 --> 2:41:23.600]  done in the past so they black out different yeah i'm going from memory here so i guess it was the
[2:41:23.600 --> 2:41:29.120]  southern poverty law center government memo where the two copies uh were obtained and then laid over
[2:41:29.120 --> 2:41:35.120]  each other um i'm going back from memory here uh was that the southern poverty law center government
[2:41:35.120 --> 2:41:39.920]  documents uh that came out that they had had had basically had people in control or in the command
[2:41:39.920 --> 2:41:44.480]  positions there where they got the two memos they laid them over each other these were all fbi
[2:41:44.480 --> 2:41:48.400]  documents but they referred to the southern poverty law center of course the southern poverty law
[2:41:48.400 --> 2:41:53.120]  center immediately called me and told me they had no involvement in this operation and all i
[2:41:53.120 --> 2:41:58.320]  said was i don't know if that's true or not but your name is sure as hell all over these 150 pages
[2:41:58.320 --> 2:42:06.080]  of fbi records talking about it in terms of a apparently a joint operation uh and and i know
[2:42:06.080 --> 2:42:10.800]  it sounds incredible to your audience but what they should keep in mind is it's not me saying this
[2:42:11.840 --> 2:42:17.920]  these are records prepared by the fb are you kidding the adl's been caught running all
[2:42:17.920 --> 2:42:22.560]  sorts of white supremacist groups i mean it's just part of the course man but i mean the point
[2:42:22.560 --> 2:42:27.840]  is it's these were fbi documents and many of them had been drafted or at least were sent out under
[2:42:27.840 --> 2:42:35.440]  the order of the director of the fbi louis free and so once i get the documents the oldest one i get
[2:42:35.440 --> 2:42:41.360]  is on the afternoon of the bombing april 19th 1995 so i go back to the court and i said look
[2:42:41.360 --> 2:42:46.080]  your honor there's no way in the hell the sting operation spraying the life three hours after
[2:42:46.080 --> 2:42:52.640]  the bombing it had to been in place beforehand and that's when i asked for permission to take
[2:42:52.640 --> 2:43:00.240]  the depositions of terry nickles and david hammer now david hammer everyone those nickles is the
[2:43:00.240 --> 2:43:06.240]  co-conspirator of mcbay hammer has spent two years on death row with mcbay and mcbay told
[2:43:06.240 --> 2:43:12.480]  him all about the bombing including the fbi's parent involvement through a ring of informants
[2:43:12.480 --> 2:43:16.960]  you know that's a good point we didn't get into last week about the nickles deposition you got
[2:43:16.960 --> 2:43:21.280]  and how they tried to block that coming out and and and how he wanted to talk to attorney general
[2:43:21.280 --> 2:43:26.480]  ashcroft then he put a gag order and blocked the media from getting to him uh perhaps we should
[2:43:26.480 --> 2:43:31.840]  flesh out what that meeting was like with nickles oh i went into i don't know how i got in but i got
[2:43:31.840 --> 2:43:39.040]  into the new alcatraz which is ad max administrative maximum prison in florans colorado it's basically
[2:43:39.040 --> 2:43:43.920]  underground the people who go in there like nickles will never come out they'll come out in a body
[2:43:43.920 --> 2:43:51.520]  bag they'll never come out alive uh it's concrete largely underground no windows i spent a day and
[2:43:51.520 --> 2:43:59.440]  a half with nickles he gave me about a 50 by i guess about 25 30 page affidavit talking about
[2:43:59.440 --> 2:44:06.000]  the bombing talking about some of the others involved uh and and so on how i came to see him
[2:44:06.000 --> 2:44:12.880]  though was apparently nickles had been convicted by the the federal jury he was tried by the federal
[2:44:12.880 --> 2:44:17.360]  government first they convicted but they refused to give him the death penalty because they said
[2:44:17.360 --> 2:44:21.920]  it's clear to us clear it was clear to them that there were others involved and they didn't understand
[2:44:21.920 --> 2:44:27.920]  why the department of justice and the fbi weren't going after the others nickles has then tried in
[2:44:27.920 --> 2:44:34.320]  state court same result jury convicts him refuses to give him the death penalty saying it's clear
[2:44:34.320 --> 2:44:40.320]  to us there are other people involved and that the fbi and the state of oklahoma and the department
[2:44:40.320 --> 2:44:44.560]  justice is not going after these people and we're not going to send nickles to death and in the story
[2:44:44.560 --> 2:44:50.400]  without knowing what all's out there and so nickles once he's convicted in state court he can't be
[2:44:50.400 --> 2:44:56.400]  retried and he can't be given the death penalty so he writes to attorney general ashcroft and he says
[2:44:56.400 --> 2:45:02.000]  come and see me and i'll tell you everything i'll tell you all the people involved and ashcroft
[2:45:02.000 --> 2:45:07.840]  not only doesn't go see him but issues in order that nickles is to have no contact with the media
[2:45:08.560 --> 2:45:13.120]  and so that's the scene when i i get in finally get in to see nickles and so i get this affidavit
[2:45:13.120 --> 2:45:19.600]  and i go back to the court and that's when the court looked at that affidavit and the court had
[2:45:19.600 --> 2:45:23.840]  unredacted copies of these documents so when the judge allowed them to turn over copies to me with
[2:45:23.840 --> 2:45:29.440]  the names blackout he ordered them to turn over copies to him without the blackout so he knew
[2:45:29.440 --> 2:45:34.720]  who was involved he knew what they were doing he knew what was planned and he said you go take
[2:45:34.720 --> 2:45:40.400]  that deposition and you take it on video now that was the documents i was going back to uh in memory
[2:45:40.400 --> 2:45:47.840]  so so what was it like talking to terry nickles uh for the time you spent with him i was he he is not
[2:45:49.120 --> 2:45:54.560]  he is not a person who professes to be innocent he's a person i think and as i think i mean
[2:45:54.560 --> 2:45:59.760]  i mentioned to you to me it's a story of sin forgiveness and redemption he's apparently
[2:45:59.760 --> 2:46:05.600]  reached out to some of the the victims families and in two in particular the the two grandmothers
[2:46:05.600 --> 2:46:11.760]  who each lost two grandsons toddlers in the daycare center and asked for forgiveness and
[2:46:12.320 --> 2:46:17.440]  they've forgiven him and they've they've struck up i guess for lack of a better word or sort of a
[2:46:18.240 --> 2:46:24.240]  friendship and he promised them he promised them that he would he would tell everything and he would
[2:46:24.240 --> 2:46:30.320]  he would clear his conscience and to the extent it can be cleared and he did tell you what really
[2:46:30.320 --> 2:46:38.080]  have but not there wasn't enough time to tell it all well that is true i mean when i say you're in a
[2:46:38.080 --> 2:46:43.600]  day and a half it's not that long because part of the time is bringing him to the room where he's
[2:46:43.600 --> 2:46:48.960]  interviewed uh part of the time is waiting for them to clear out of the room because they're not
[2:46:48.960 --> 2:46:52.960]  supposed to be listening to it but you know they are anyway and then they come back and do their
[2:46:52.960 --> 2:46:59.840]  routine checks so that it's constantly disruption and it's you you're in a risk of being searched
[2:46:59.840 --> 2:47:05.200]  and everything else when you leave there so that's not there's some things that he he was afraid to
[2:47:05.200 --> 2:47:11.680]  talk about they'd want to talk about for fear that that they would hear or over here or or find out
[2:47:11.680 --> 2:47:18.800]  but he did say enough that there were at least he claims that the fbi was involved uh that an
[2:47:18.800 --> 2:47:29.440]  fbi informant according to him even provided the detonators used in the law but uh well i'll tell
[2:47:29.440 --> 2:47:35.440]  you what uh i'll tell you what stay there and then when we come back uh we're going to continue
[2:47:35.440 --> 2:47:40.720]  our discussion with you about what terry nickles told you the affidavit you got out how this helped

[2:51:55.600 --> 2:51:59.840]  turn their hearts back on fox news has reported that and said it's a great thing they're doing
[2:51:59.840 --> 2:52:04.880]  that's in my film uh police state three total enslavement so this you know torture of people
[2:52:04.880 --> 2:52:10.480]  to get confessions from them uh i was on the treadmill this morning watching cable and i was
[2:52:10.480 --> 2:52:15.600]  watching dragnet and they were the good guys crushing the man's testicles to get the answers
[2:52:15.600 --> 2:52:22.080]  uh tom hanks and dan acroy torture the guy by crushing his testicles and it's so funny but see
[2:52:22.080 --> 2:52:27.280]  it's not funny in real life on two big guys are knocking your teeth out and you know putting you
[2:52:27.280 --> 2:52:33.600]  on pcp and having prostitutes dance around in devil outfits uh i mean it's just all sorts of
[2:52:33.600 --> 2:52:40.320]  things you can't imagine i mean i could never have thought of this um you know i can't even get
[2:52:40.320 --> 2:52:46.320]  into it on air folks it's too disgusting uh but uh needles to save it freaks me out it really freaks
[2:52:46.320 --> 2:52:52.240]  these muslims out and uh so now they've tortured them for seven years they've got their so so
[2:52:52.240 --> 2:52:57.600]  that's the system we're facing jesse trying to do continuing sir uh with in that day and a half
[2:52:57.600 --> 2:53:02.160]  with terry nickles what you were able to learn what was in the affidavits that's uh that they've
[2:53:02.160 --> 2:53:08.400]  tried to quash and uh you know it is that affidavit public when can it go public will it go public
[2:53:08.400 --> 2:53:14.400]  the affidavits public record yeah uh nickles basically said that he was under the impression that
[2:53:15.040 --> 2:53:21.520]  uh the fbi was playing some role in handling tim migvey and that one of the informants had
[2:53:21.520 --> 2:53:27.520]  actually provided the detonators for the bomb uh i think it's what's interesting though is i've
[2:53:27.520 --> 2:53:34.000]  made those accusations in this lawsuit and the fbi had never denied them and the accusations were
[2:53:34.000 --> 2:53:40.160]  pretty specific that they were involved possibly with the german government or and others in a
[2:53:40.160 --> 2:53:46.560]  sting operation to infiltrate the militias groups in this country it went bad on them
[2:53:46.560 --> 2:53:50.960]  it resulted in the bombing in oklahoma well that's their spin i mean two weeks ago german
[2:53:50.960 --> 2:53:56.160]  intelligence was caught roiders reported staging bombings on nato facilities did you see that
[2:53:56.160 --> 2:54:01.200]  no i didn't yeah they specialize in in attacking federal buildings that's their little favorite
[2:54:01.200 --> 2:54:06.640]  that's the german the german mark is attacking their the german signature is they like to attack
[2:54:06.640 --> 2:54:11.120]  cops because then that gets the cops to do whatever they say and they were caught uh two
[2:54:11.120 --> 2:54:18.080]  mondays ago uh der spiegel roiders all i mean was admitted just cut and dry uh nato police caught
[2:54:18.080 --> 2:54:24.640]  him but but specifically uh he said that migvey told him that yeah that he was in in black operations
[2:54:24.640 --> 2:54:31.840]  he he inferred it from some things migvey said that that's what was taking place specifically
[2:54:31.840 --> 2:54:38.080]  what did migvey say i can't remember now i haven't looked at it in some time that that uh the fbi
[2:54:38.080 --> 2:54:44.000]  had had changed the plans or changed the target and migvey didn't like that he didn't like that
[2:54:44.640 --> 2:54:48.320]  what are the original target men uh nickel said he didn't know
[2:54:49.680 --> 2:54:53.520]  he didn't know what the target was but he was under the impression it was going to be done at night
[2:54:53.520 --> 2:54:59.840]  in an empty building yeah let's say this again the fbi changed the target from an empty building
[2:54:59.840 --> 2:55:06.800]  to the federal building and changed the time so there's your loving fbi blowing up federal
[2:55:06.800 --> 2:55:11.520]  buildings of course the fbi and batf they weren't it worked that day were they jesse that's my
[2:55:11.520 --> 2:55:15.600]  understanding they weren't oh then they showed up and told the local doctor showed up on the scene
[2:55:15.600 --> 2:55:19.840]  patch me up say i'm hurt and the doctor said no and what did they say
[2:55:19.840 --> 2:55:26.880]  they said you die we'll be right back stay with us ladies and gentlemen jesse trying to
[2:55:26.880 --> 2:55:30.080]  do is our guests back in 70 seconds with the fourth hour
[2:55:32.720 --> 2:55:36.640]  hello friends this is alex jones i've told you for a long time it's important to be
[2:55:36.640 --> 2:55:40.880]  self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever we need to be independent and food
[2:55:40.880 --> 2:55:45.360]  and water is the key you'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread you'll
[2:55:45.360 --> 2:55:50.080]  never have to go to the superdome and beg for female to take care of your family in any emergency
[2:55:50.080 --> 2:55:54.560]  if you simply prepare our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bail out of a special
[2:55:54.560 --> 2:55:59.120]  interest so they ignored your screams not to do it they turned off the telephones and email they
[2:55:59.120 --> 2:56:03.760]  voted to print eight hundred and fifty billion dollars at least out of thin air this money now
[2:56:03.760 --> 2:56:08.880]  owns the american and european banks the exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your
[2:56:08.880 --> 2:56:14.320]  life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities particularly food beyond many americans
[2:56:14.320 --> 2:56:19.600]  reach in pre-nazi germany super inflation the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days
[2:56:19.600 --> 2:56:24.800]  until it reached over four billion marks food prices are skyrocketing so fast there seems as
[2:56:24.800 --> 2:56:29.680]  if there may be no end in sight the private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan
[2:56:29.680 --> 2:56:33.920]  grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves the stores have less food but jack of
[2:56:33.920 --> 2:56:38.720]  prices to stay in business whatever happens in america we need to be prepared and be ready
[2:56:38.720 --> 2:56:43.040]  everything is zeroing out on food one third of americans have to choose between buying food
[2:56:43.040 --> 2:56:48.000]  and paying for other necessities my friends whatever it takes get prepared get self-sufficient
[2:56:48.000 --> 2:56:51.840]  get food for everybody out there listening it's very important for you to understand that by
[2:56:51.840 --> 2:56:56.240]  having a supply of storable food the government the new old order has a lot less control over you
[2:56:56.240 --> 2:57:01.120]  and so it's a mindset a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness no one is going to take care

[2:57:55.040 --> 2:57:59.120]  jesse trying to do is our guests your calls are coming up this is a short segment jesse
[2:58:01.440 --> 2:58:04.960]  but long segment coming up plenty of time to break down everything that's happening and going
[2:58:04.960 --> 2:58:11.600]  on so specifically i remember a few years ago when you first broke this here on this show
[2:58:12.960 --> 2:58:16.560]  there were quite a few documents and affidavits and things that were blocked
[2:58:17.520 --> 2:58:21.840]  that that you couldn't bring out at that time i'm interested about the chain of events
[2:58:21.840 --> 2:58:24.560]  of when the affidavit and the rest of it was finally made public
[2:58:26.080 --> 2:58:32.880]  was made public in this fight to get basically there to what happened is i go to the court with
[2:58:32.880 --> 2:58:39.440]  some initial things that nickles had given me including documents a few he'd had plus his
[2:58:39.440 --> 2:58:46.880]  sworn statement the judge has those and plus he has the unredacted documents the fbi gave him
[2:58:47.600 --> 2:58:52.640]  and that's when he ordered me give me an order says you go take that deposition and of course the
[2:58:52.640 --> 2:58:58.960]  government immediately filed a motion asking him to reconsider and withdraw the order and it took
[2:58:58.960 --> 2:59:03.840]  a year to fight that motion out i mean his original order allowing me to take the depositions
[2:59:03.840 --> 2:59:10.640]  was handed down in september of 2007 the fbi fought like hell for an entire year and then then
[2:59:10.640 --> 2:59:15.600]  this last september 2008 he denied their motion and said go i told you go take the deposition
[2:59:16.400 --> 2:59:21.200]  and they now here in the last few days appealed that order to the court of appeals
[2:59:21.760 --> 2:59:25.040]  but the point i was going to make before the break through your audience is they've never
[2:59:25.040 --> 2:59:30.160]  denied the accusations i mean it my accusations are you infiltrated this group you actually
[2:59:30.160 --> 2:59:35.360]  gin these people up to do that bombing you knew it was going to happen and whether you wanted
[2:59:35.360 --> 2:59:40.400]  to happen or not you didn't stop it oh that's their mo i mean take a mod salon and the 93
[2:59:40.400 --> 2:59:44.480]  world trade center i'm sure you know the story new york times chicago tribune they all i mean this
[2:59:44.480 --> 2:59:49.760]  is a fact they hire mod salon like andres crossmeyer being german intelligence they hire
[2:59:49.760 --> 2:59:54.240]  egyptian intelligence buddies with the u.s they bring him over they say oh we're just gonna bomb
[2:59:54.240 --> 2:59:59.040]  a empty building you're gonna build a fake bomb to bust some crazy muslims then they say now the
[2:59:59.040 --> 3:00:02.720]  target's the world trade center we're gonna build a real bomb to make it stick in court and he goes
[3:00:02.720 --> 3:00:06.480]  i don't want to do that and they say you want your money you're under orders then he builds the real
[3:00:06.480 --> 3:00:10.160]  bomb they give him real detonators then they say we're gonna let him go ahead and bomb the building
[3:00:10.160 --> 3:00:15.920]  he thinks they're setting him up he records them ordering him to bomb the building now i mean again
[3:00:15.920 --> 3:00:25.920]  what he will what how did the fbi get criminals this evil jesse well i think it's a bird of a
[3:00:25.920 --> 3:00:32.320]  feather and there are lots of good fbi agents and they've helped me i don't know who they are
[3:00:32.880 --> 3:00:38.080]  i receive things from people that don't know who they are but the high level units they're the
[3:00:38.080 --> 3:00:42.240]  bad ones they're the bad ones so you don't rise to the top of the fbi without being
[3:00:42.240 --> 3:00:46.960]  basically a crook in my opinion bombing daycare centers it's more than a crook
[3:00:47.840 --> 3:00:52.880]  and with a criminal i mean i mean this is sick this is sick and i don't know if they intended
[3:00:52.880 --> 3:00:56.800]  or not but they did it and and the point is i accuse them of it and they never denied it well
[3:00:56.800 --> 3:01:01.920]  they changed the target from an empty building to the federal building but at the point that i was
[3:01:01.920 --> 3:01:06.000]  going to say is that they've never denied the accusations they just pleaded with this judge
[3:01:06.880 --> 3:01:10.880]  not to give the documents to me and he didn't accept that then they pleaded with him not to
[3:01:10.880 --> 3:01:16.400]  let this deposition go forward and he didn't accept that and for those of your audience of my age
[3:01:16.400 --> 3:01:22.880]  who remember watergate a watergate didn't come out overnight he got him out as a result of a
[3:01:22.880 --> 3:01:29.280]  a mean ass federal judge named john sirika who held the the government's feet to the fire until
[3:01:29.280 --> 3:01:35.600]  the story came out and i think we've got john sirika here i wonder if he's got his insurance up to
[3:01:35.600 --> 3:01:41.520]  date it's been a hard fight and it's far from over i know a lot of people say
[3:01:42.800 --> 3:01:46.480]  you know why are you doing it and i i said i never started out to solve the
[3:01:46.480 --> 3:01:52.160]  old home city bombing i just want justice for my family and the people kill my brother
[3:01:52.160 --> 3:01:56.400]  but that's how it works in life as you know when you start out what injustice for yourself
[3:01:56.400 --> 3:02:00.720]  you find out it's connected to everybody else well it appears to be the case here because
[3:02:00.720 --> 3:02:06.560]  everything is taking me to oklahoma city in the bombing every every lead every witness
[3:02:07.520 --> 3:02:12.320]  every piece of the story evidence it all goes back how do these fbi guys on the dark side
[3:02:12.320 --> 3:02:16.720]  when you get around them how do they behave well they tried twice to indict me
[3:02:18.640 --> 3:02:23.920]  as i said they harassed my family i have my wife go out and start the car in the morning
[3:02:23.920 --> 3:02:31.120]  that's a joke let's talk about where this goes from here and other key points in the case when
[3:02:31.120 --> 3:02:36.240]  we get back then we're gonna open the phones up at eight hundred two five at nine nine two three one
[3:02:36.240 --> 3:02:42.000]  our guest is jesse trying to do we're very honored to have him with us i'm gonna talk to jesse right
[3:02:42.000 --> 3:02:51.120]  now jesse jesse yes we're on the we're not on the am and fm or shortwave or satellite right now
[3:02:51.120 --> 3:02:55.360]  but we are streaming live over the web i like to do these little behind the scenes things in
[3:02:55.360 --> 3:03:00.400]  the fourth hour and we're also at prison planet dot tv i'm kind of conducting the interview here
[3:03:00.400 --> 3:03:04.480]  today and all over the map what are some of the points you want to make sure that we point out
[3:03:04.480 --> 3:03:09.760]  i mean the website the reward uh... where you're going from here you're not giving up on justice
[3:03:09.760 --> 3:03:14.320]  i mean uh... what are some of the other points you want to make that base i think we haven't
[3:03:14.320 --> 3:03:19.840]  gotten into eric holder very much i think you know we clearly got eric holder here's the second
[3:03:19.840 --> 3:03:23.200]  the commander of the department of justice covering this murder of a little person up
[3:03:23.840 --> 3:03:28.000]  and you have to say why in the hell like you said that the invasion of normandy or they're doing this
[3:03:28.720 --> 3:03:33.120]  and i i i i firmly believe holder played a role i don't have i have seen nothing i don't have
[3:03:33.120 --> 3:03:37.920]  anything on paper well you have the fb i uh... email saying he's in command of the operation
[3:03:37.920 --> 3:03:42.320]  that's as big as normandy yeah but i mean i don't have anything on paper him covering up the bombing
[3:03:42.320 --> 3:03:46.240]  but i'm sure he was you have him covering up the murder your brother yeah but i'm sure he was
[3:03:46.240 --> 3:03:51.760]  linked i mean if he's got his hand in covering up the murder of a citizen then you know he's got
[3:03:51.760 --> 3:03:55.760]  his hand in covering up the murder of a hundred sixty nine two and they're hardcore i know that
[3:03:56.960 --> 3:04:02.560]  this country's in for a lot of trouble uh... the uh... gun grabbing obamas and holders and clinton's
[3:04:02.560 --> 3:04:06.720]  and they're talking about al gordon administration they hate america they hate the second amendment
[3:04:06.720 --> 3:04:11.040]  and they are not going to give us any rest they're probably going to stage it and the problem is
[3:04:11.040 --> 3:04:15.600]  they're going to stage more domestic attacks you notice they've said suddenly oh al qaeda isn't
[3:04:15.600 --> 3:04:19.840]  going to be striking now it's going to be blonde-haired blue-eyed al qaeda there's thousands
[3:04:19.840 --> 3:04:24.320]  they're about to hit us we have to have troops on the streets and they're training every city
[3:04:24.320 --> 3:04:28.560]  for roadside bombs saying there's there's militia they're all about to strike
[3:04:29.280 --> 3:04:32.720]  and that's how they're going to get the troops on the streets of america is they're going to run
[3:04:32.720 --> 3:04:38.400]  around killing cops blowing stuff up and blaming it on the american people so they're bringing in
[3:04:38.400 --> 3:04:43.200]  holder the specialist in all this of course we have the batf out in new mexico blowing up rider
[3:04:43.200 --> 3:04:46.000]  trucks the months before i mean we just have these people
[3:04:47.360 --> 3:04:52.160]  well i i think that the clinton's certainly were were terrified of the militia movement
[3:04:52.800 --> 3:05:00.080]  pat conn started under their watch uh... and i think there's less chance of getting to the truth
[3:05:00.080 --> 3:05:04.240]  about the bombing and anything else if you bring back the clinton people into this administration
[3:05:04.240 --> 3:05:09.760]  that's right we have to expose the the the the last false flag under these people to stop the
[3:05:09.760 --> 3:05:13.120]  new ones and i want the police listening well i'll say it on air here we go
[3:05:15.360 --> 3:05:20.640]  let me come back out of break start saving over a thousand dollars a year for your family of four

[3:05:43.600 --> 3:05:52.000]  presents the alex jones show because there's a war on for your mind i want to tell the fbi of police
[3:05:52.000 --> 3:06:00.800]  something it's wrong the fbi and batf were all out of the building when the fbi bombed it in 95
[3:06:00.800 --> 3:06:07.840]  and uh i've been studying the enemy's attack pattern i believe they're going to bring back
[3:06:07.840 --> 3:06:13.840]  the domestic terrorism they're going to target military and police to get you all hyped up
[3:06:13.840 --> 3:06:20.000]  to attack the american people you see in seattle in 99 and denver this year and uh mini apple of
[3:06:20.000 --> 3:06:25.360]  st paul this year and in ottawa this year the police were caught everywhere this year and of
[3:06:25.360 --> 3:06:30.400]  course hundreds of times previously with cops dressed up like anarchists they run up and attack
[3:06:30.400 --> 3:06:35.200]  other police a lot of times the police don't even know they're being attacked by other cops and it's
[3:06:35.200 --> 3:06:40.480]  real in the case of canada this year uh for the big global summit the north american union summit
[3:06:40.480 --> 3:06:45.680]  they knew it was staged and it later came out that it was cops after they attacked themselves
[3:06:45.680 --> 3:06:51.760]  they then rubber bullet and attack the peaceful crowd and baby carriages with pepper spray and
[3:06:51.760 --> 3:06:56.560]  they we've got videos of the after meeting police you know with them going great job routing that
[3:06:56.560 --> 3:07:03.920]  scum men do you see me shoot that lady in the face with rubber bullets
[3:07:03.920 --> 3:07:09.840]  cops you think it's fun staging terror you know provocateur attacks where somebody
[3:07:09.840 --> 3:07:14.560]  throws bottles at other cops how about when the feds blow up your building with you in it
[3:07:14.560 --> 3:07:19.840]  see this isn't funny killing cops isn't funny i know you think it's cute because when you're
[3:07:19.840 --> 3:07:25.440]  killing you killing your own people it's like a little fun inside goodie good but it's sick
[3:07:25.440 --> 3:07:31.280]  it's degenerate it's it's disgusting when german intelligence got caught two weeks ago staging
[3:07:31.280 --> 3:07:36.000]  terror attacks against themselves and they got caught and you're all going to be caught for
[3:07:36.000 --> 3:07:39.440]  all of this now i want to go to your phone calls coming up the next segment at one eight hundred
[3:07:39.440 --> 3:07:44.160]  two five nine nine two three one the main reason that we've got uh just you try to do here is he's
[3:07:44.160 --> 3:07:50.400]  won the big case for a couple months he's had a quarter million dollar reward out for evidence
[3:07:50.400 --> 3:07:56.960]  leading to the arrest of the people that killed his brother he won the case uh you know not for
[3:07:56.960 --> 3:08:01.840]  murder but for all sorts of abuse and and and admitting the government did bad did wrong
[3:08:01.840 --> 3:08:06.000]  that's a big issue right there and they did torture him to death obviously in the jail cell
[3:08:06.560 --> 3:08:11.680]  that's not really being debated the fbi as he says not is not denying when he's in court
[3:08:11.680 --> 3:08:16.960]  he's not denying when he puts out affidavits that that they made the bomb they train the people
[3:08:16.960 --> 3:08:22.560]  mcvey was army black ops they were going to bomb an empty warehouse but instead mcvey got mad when
[3:08:22.560 --> 3:08:26.640]  they changed it to bombing the murray building that's why they probably set him up as the patsy
[3:08:27.920 --> 3:08:30.720]  and you know so we're going to kill your whole family if you don't go along with this here's
[3:08:31.760 --> 3:08:35.280]  video of mommy out there taking the trash out we're going to torture her to death
[3:08:35.280 --> 3:08:40.480]  for a long time if you don't play ball when he was picked up he was obviously drugged
[3:08:40.480 --> 3:08:44.480]  stumbling around thumbing at the mouth saying i've got a chip in my butt so no telling what
[3:08:44.480 --> 3:08:49.600]  happened there jolly and west the famous mind control doctor from mk ultra hearings in 77
[3:08:49.600 --> 3:08:54.480]  becomes his his doctor until the time he's executed in terrahude so so that's some of the basics but
[3:08:54.480 --> 3:09:00.080]  eric holder involved in the cover-up we have the internal memos the emails this is confirmed in the
[3:09:00.080 --> 3:09:05.280]  case about how he was running the cover-up of your brother's murder and how this was a quote as
[3:09:05.280 --> 3:09:11.600]  complex as the normandy invasion and how they had to have a unified front pr spin that's all up on
[3:09:11.600 --> 3:09:16.720]  info wars dot com plug your website with all the documents photos the reward and then let's get
[3:09:16.720 --> 3:09:22.160]  into holder and where you're going from here all the documents we talked about her at the reward
[3:09:22.160 --> 3:09:28.960]  site which is my brother's initials can michael trinidad k m t reward one word k m t reward dot
[3:09:28.960 --> 3:09:36.160]  com uh... you'll have it all there and back to to eric holder the documents reflected holder
[3:09:36.160 --> 3:09:41.760]  ran the cover-up of my brother's murder and holder was the second command of the department
[3:09:41.760 --> 3:09:47.040]  of justice in the clinton reno justice department and you have to ask yourself what is the second
[3:09:48.320 --> 3:09:53.760]  in command of the department of justice doing one covering up a murder period but even being
[3:09:53.760 --> 3:10:00.880]  involved in the death of a an ordinary citizen you would never never see that and it didn't make
[3:10:00.880 --> 3:10:07.040]  sense at the time but it does now and if if he knew and i think he did that if this murder was
[3:10:07.040 --> 3:10:11.280]  solved it would go to the the government's role in the bombing then he sure would be involved
[3:10:11.280 --> 3:10:16.560]  in covering that up because that would have cost bill clinton a reelection in 1996 well the american
[3:10:16.560 --> 3:10:22.720]  people had known about the fbis role well we thought we were getting rid of the clinton's with
[3:10:22.720 --> 3:10:28.160]  obama people thought that i knew they were that they were running obama uh... and here they all
[3:10:28.160 --> 3:10:32.800]  come al gore hillary clinton the same bill clinton's gonna be in the administration all the same
[3:10:32.800 --> 3:10:39.600]  people that ran waco and in an oklahoma they're just all back and they want our guns please continue
[3:10:40.320 --> 3:10:45.200]  well i i can say this that i agree with you there and i i contributed money to obama's campaign
[3:10:45.200 --> 3:10:49.360]  i voted for him but i didn't vote for him to bring the clinton's back and with the clinton's coming
[3:10:49.360 --> 3:10:55.840]  back in the power of the chance of this story ever seen lie today my brother's murder and the bombing
[3:10:55.840 --> 3:11:01.760]  gets slimmer and slimmer well the whole government stages false flags all the time so none of them
[3:11:01.760 --> 3:11:06.080]  are ever gonna let it come out but you have beat them so far where do you go from here
[3:11:06.880 --> 3:11:11.680]  well i think the most important thing i i have two two big three big fights obviously to get the
[3:11:11.680 --> 3:11:17.280]  the minute kill my brother and the other fight is to get the truth out through terry nickles
[3:11:17.280 --> 3:11:21.920]  said if something doesn't happen to him in the interim and then i thought i've sued him again
[3:11:21.920 --> 3:11:28.640]  the i understand that i've had a pretty good authority that uh there's a cia report out there
[3:11:28.640 --> 3:11:36.080]  that says that uh the fbi was involved in elaheim city with the german government in that sting
[3:11:36.080 --> 3:11:42.640]  operation and that the fbi does have a surveillance tape that shows the rider truck pulling up in
[3:11:42.640 --> 3:11:47.200]  front of the mural building and the description of the government's description of that tape is
[3:11:47.200 --> 3:11:53.520]  is the bomb detonates three minutes and six seconds after the suspects quote unquote exit
[3:11:53.520 --> 3:11:58.160]  the truck well i mean we have the la times and everybody a bunch of people uh interviewing
[3:11:58.160 --> 3:12:03.520]  the fbi agents who saw the tape and it shows mcvay and one of their guy getting out and then of
[3:12:03.520 --> 3:12:08.480]  course they've they've sequestered that tape what through three lawsuits yes but i've sued them to
[3:12:08.480 --> 3:12:14.960]  get it and uh you have to ask yourself and i'll answer the question too is that would be the best
[3:12:14.960 --> 3:12:20.000]  evidence of the crime is an actual videotape of the people doing it and you say why wouldn't you
[3:12:20.560 --> 3:12:25.040]  have shown that as evidence at nickles trial and mcvay's trial and the obvious answer is
[3:12:25.040 --> 3:12:28.880]  one of the people getting out of the truck was or two of the people getting out of the truck
[3:12:28.880 --> 3:12:36.080]  were on your payroll and that's why you don't want to show well they were all in the payroll mcvay
[3:12:36.080 --> 3:12:40.960]  was on their payroll now he got recruited out of the army that was the inside info we always had it
[3:12:40.960 --> 3:12:45.920]  have you ever seen the video of the guy up at the military camp uh a few months before it
[3:12:45.920 --> 3:12:50.880]  when he supposedly out of the military who looks just like mcvay i haven't that's pretty
[3:12:50.880 --> 3:12:55.360]  power it is mcvay there's no doubt about it have you seen the camp grouper photos taken by off duty
[3:12:55.360 --> 3:13:01.760]  police flying their sesna of the uh at the army base with the fuel oil tanks and then and they're
[3:13:01.760 --> 3:13:06.960]  loading a rider truck behind security fences with the money of nitrate that one i haven't seen either
[3:13:06.960 --> 3:13:12.080]  i haven't seen that i came late to this fight camp grouper yeah i mean there's so much evidence
[3:13:12.080 --> 3:13:17.200]  it's incredible i mean you know about him killing cops and and and coroners and and doctors and
[3:13:17.200 --> 3:13:22.160]  and witnesses right and that i i'm i know about and i think they're fully capable of it
[3:13:23.600 --> 3:13:28.400]  you know and and that's why i i mean i made a joke about starting the car but i i i recognize
[3:13:28.400 --> 3:13:35.120]  early on that for my own security anything i i did get i couldn't keep it to myself i had to get it
[3:13:35.120 --> 3:13:39.680]  out into the public and i've been and that's why i'm the minute i get an affidavit from terry
[3:13:39.680 --> 3:13:44.320]  now i get something i i file it in the court says public record well most of the people doing all
[3:13:44.320 --> 3:13:49.200]  this killing view profile and there's different types but mainly they're former military they've
[3:13:49.200 --> 3:13:54.960]  been in black ops they've killed families in nicaragua al salvador africa they've seen dead
[3:13:54.960 --> 3:14:00.560]  kids everywhere and they just start liking it and so hey you know kill 160 something people in a
[3:14:00.560 --> 3:14:05.920]  federal building blow up some kids collateral damage collateral damage and you but how would
[3:14:05.920 --> 3:14:10.160]  they like something happening to them or their family oh then it's all oh my goodness no nothing
[3:14:10.160 --> 3:14:15.920]  can happen to us and uh... there's of course they got away with oklahoma city so why not 911
[3:14:16.560 --> 3:14:21.120]  and uh... you know they just never stop it just gets bigger and worse and more out of control
[3:14:21.760 --> 3:14:25.520]  and uh... you know i'm not even looking for a fight with these people i want them to stop
[3:14:25.520 --> 3:14:30.720]  killing us and stop destroying our country but they've got a job to do to bring this nation down
[3:14:30.720 --> 3:14:35.600]  uh... give me ideas about stopping eric holder by becoming the attorney general
[3:14:36.160 --> 3:14:41.440]  i just think that the the i don't know how much good it would do but i have your audience your
[3:14:41.440 --> 3:14:47.360]  listeners of the right call email your congressmen or senators and tell them to look into this man's
[3:14:47.360 --> 3:14:52.640]  background i mean again it's not me making this up these are government documents with
[3:14:52.640 --> 3:14:57.120]  holder involved in the cover-up of my brother's murder what's probably on his resume probably
[3:14:57.120 --> 3:15:02.560]  his internal resume says you know oklahoma city bombing i think well come on in here man this
[3:15:02.560 --> 3:15:09.520]  is good we got a lot of federal targets for you need to put in perspective we here today they
[3:15:09.520 --> 3:15:16.160]  indicted the uh... the five former servicemen for the shootings in iraq and i i don't know
[3:15:16.160 --> 3:15:21.840]  the circumstance i mean it takes place in the combat zone uh... most of our former marines
[3:15:21.840 --> 3:15:27.680]  or airborne i was in the core i know those people are you you they're well-dressed up when they're
[3:15:27.680 --> 3:15:35.440]  trained uh... they don't fly off the handle and do things like that in my estimation their order
[3:15:35.440 --> 3:15:40.800]  point is that they were they're being prosecuted for and if they did that they should be for what
[3:15:40.800 --> 3:15:48.480]  took place in iraq you have my brother who's in in custody of the fb i in a cell where nobody
[3:15:48.480 --> 3:15:54.160]  but the fb i basically has access to him they have all the evidence and nobody gets prosecuted
[3:15:54.160 --> 3:16:00.720]  it's they prosecutions by the federal government are selective it's called untouchable they they
[3:16:00.720 --> 3:16:05.280]  have a there's a reason they do it well they just arrested the illinois governor who i by the way
[3:16:05.280 --> 3:16:10.720]  hey he's a gun grabber uh... but they just arrested him for what's normal in u.s politics you know
[3:16:10.720 --> 3:16:15.840]  hey i'll give you this appointment if you give me that appointment and now they've arrested him
[3:16:15.840 --> 3:16:21.360]  um... i mean while you got daily mob bossing there in the city and then it's nothing compared
[3:16:21.360 --> 3:16:25.520]  to all the other corruption you know they they selectively prosecute the federal government
[3:16:25.520 --> 3:16:30.480]  does crimes committed by themselves against the citizens are not prosecuted uh...
[3:16:32.160 --> 3:16:37.840]  they do it to further their own own interest it's a mafia with government power
[3:16:37.840 --> 3:16:46.080]  well i've often said that uh... the fb i is a again your audience should know that i have
[3:16:47.600 --> 3:16:56.400]  i hate that institution but it's it's it's not i think it's actually worse than the old kgb because
[3:16:56.400 --> 3:17:01.520]  the kgb they do the same thing but the kgb never claimed to be a legitimate law enforcement agency
[3:17:01.520 --> 3:17:09.520]  and the fb i does back when you were a marine did you have any idea how this country was really run
[3:17:10.720 --> 3:17:15.200]  no i was one of my brother's murder they didn't either i expected the government to do the right
[3:17:15.200 --> 3:17:20.640]  thing you know i mean and look at family courts there's no due process there they don't follow
[3:17:20.640 --> 3:17:25.520]  any law there the whole country's a giant happy hunting ground for crooks to get into government
[3:17:25.520 --> 3:17:29.600]  and have their way with the people and i for one am sick of it plus they're bringing the whole
[3:17:29.600 --> 3:17:33.680]  country down now they've gotten so corrupt everything's collapsing like a third world nation

[3:22:27.040 --> 3:22:33.680]  the audience with this thought that i didn't do things that i didn't start to go to oklahoma city
[3:22:34.720 --> 3:22:39.520]  following my brother's murder took me there i didn't start out hating my government i didn't start
[3:22:39.520 --> 3:22:44.560]  out distrusting my government i certainly didn't start out distrusting the or hating the fbi i went
[3:22:44.560 --> 3:22:50.000]  to my government i went to the fbi asking them to do the right thing to investigate my brother's
[3:22:50.000 --> 3:22:56.000]  murder to prosecute the people who did it and to punish him and instead of that i got lies i got
[3:22:56.000 --> 3:23:02.720]  cover-up i got harassment and my government and the fbi tried at least twice to indict me to shut
[3:23:02.720 --> 3:23:08.320]  me up and they said it for that reason that i have the documents i never sent them to you but that
[3:23:08.320 --> 3:23:15.680]  it where they said the purpose of indicting me was to stop my inquiry to shut me up not that i've
[3:23:15.680 --> 3:23:22.400]  done anything wrong but just to shut me up see that's what's so crazy is that they're so corrupt
[3:23:22.400 --> 3:23:27.440]  they'll even put in their own memos that they're committing racketeering crimes i mean to put false
[3:23:27.440 --> 3:23:32.080]  charges on somebody just to shut down an investigation into the government that's criminal but it's
[3:23:32.080 --> 3:23:36.880]  such a culture of criminality that it's just right out in the open now well they said they were doing
[3:23:36.880 --> 3:23:41.680]  it because i was on a campaign and that's their words campaign to discredit discredit the federal
[3:23:41.680 --> 3:23:48.960]  government well uh you sociopath psychopaths you killed his brother you blew up a building full
[3:23:48.960 --> 3:23:54.800]  of little kids i know you don't care about them what about the federal officers your fellow god

[3:24:01.440 --> 3:24:07.680]  gods i mean you know i guess that doesn't matter though when a super god kills a lower god unbelievable

[3:24:33.760 --> 3:24:40.240]  absolutely um and i apologize because it's it's it's really obvious from everything that you're
[3:24:40.240 --> 3:24:46.240]  saying that there's ultimately a real big problem there and as a member of law enforcement a 9-11
[3:24:46.240 --> 3:24:52.160]  uh responder it is my real apology to you that you went through that situation and i apologize
[3:24:52.160 --> 3:25:01.120]  um my question is uh uh morris these he was the uh the founder of the sudden poverty loss
[3:25:01.120 --> 3:25:06.640]  center correct it's that's my understanding yes he was what what is his culpability there i mean
[3:25:06.640 --> 3:25:14.160]  it you see um i've seen a couple documentaries i mean what do you find any culpability with
[3:25:14.160 --> 3:25:20.160]  regards to his position in that organization i mean where where does he come from well i
[3:25:20.160 --> 3:25:24.000]  know all i know is that they the sudden poverty loss centers told me they're they're not involved
[3:25:24.960 --> 3:25:30.080]  uh the fbi documents on the other hand say they are involved i don't think any i don't have a
[3:25:30.880 --> 3:25:36.000]  problem with with monitoring hate groups that can do harm to american citizens but
[3:25:36.720 --> 3:25:42.480]  absolutely but you as you know from law enforcement you've got to stop them before they do it well
[3:25:42.480 --> 3:25:48.960]  they also mislabel they like mix second amendment groups or property rights groups in with the
[3:25:48.960 --> 3:25:55.520]  Ku Klux Klan and i think john i've got a question for you yes you're in local law enforcement
[3:25:56.160 --> 3:26:01.840]  uh jersey i'm a guy he's a police detective not in the federal government now if you've done
[3:26:01.840 --> 3:26:07.520]  something wrong what would the federal government's approach been to you uh and they they jacked the
[3:26:07.520 --> 3:26:14.000]  jail up and put you under it i mean in what sense so i mean but i mean that they pursue local law
[3:26:14.000 --> 3:26:19.840]  enforcement people whether they've done anything wrong or not well i mean they're confident well
[3:26:19.840 --> 3:26:28.080]  that's part of federalization yes we are we we we definitely are uh carpentry uh we we're putting
[3:26:28.080 --> 3:26:33.760]  through a situation and it sort of is like the movies you know how they portray the disdain
[3:26:33.760 --> 3:26:41.680]  between federal uh fbi dea local law enforcement there is a general disdain because local law
[3:26:41.680 --> 3:26:48.080]  enforcement you know it's really not um a perception it really is it's actually actual
[3:26:48.720 --> 3:26:54.240]  we really are just glorified security guards and if my brother had died and been killed in a in a
[3:26:56.000 --> 3:27:02.400]  in a county jail or or stay prison i think you can safely say the fb had been all over that wouldn't

[3:27:21.920 --> 3:27:26.240]  to take over and that's how the federalization is happening the feds have taken over scores of
[3:27:26.240 --> 3:27:34.080]  cities they actually run them we'll be right back we're on the march the empires on the run

[3:31:37.680 --> 3:31:42.640]  them i'm just saying look you people are out of control destroying the country and i've got to fight
[3:31:42.640 --> 3:31:46.960]  you and uh you know you murdered this guy's brother and he stood up to you and he's beating you
[3:31:49.360 --> 3:31:52.240]  they probably aren't going to kill you though they've already harassed your family and your
[3:31:52.240 --> 3:31:55.920]  parents till they died because now they don't want to draw attention to themselves by killing you
[3:31:56.560 --> 3:32:01.280]  but who knows they're so reckless now they might cut your head off and stick it on a pike in front
[3:32:01.280 --> 3:32:05.920]  of town i mean though i mean as they are in the gates of the city uh there is just a flagrants
[3:32:05.920 --> 3:32:09.840]  by these people now but i uh just trying to i just want to commend you going back to john
[3:32:09.840 --> 3:32:13.600]  in new york police detective out there and we can confirm he is we know who he is he's had
[3:32:13.600 --> 3:32:17.840]  nine eleven truth into jersey and new york uh finishing up the point you were making that
[3:32:17.840 --> 3:32:24.720]  i want to get to the other calls uh absolutely alice uh just real uh quick story uh 9 13 0 1
[3:32:24.720 --> 3:32:32.800]  um we what we received was a uh a crossed reference manifest of obviously middle eastern
[3:32:32.800 --> 3:32:38.640]  names that's actually when we had a constitution back then before the patriot act so they actually
[3:32:38.640 --> 3:32:44.960]  had to manufacture a a manifest of people that had you know middle eastern names but with um
[3:32:45.600 --> 3:32:50.800]  very slight what we call scoff law you know uh you know park and ticket warrants that they didn't
[3:32:50.800 --> 3:32:58.560]  they didn't serve they didn't pay their tickets very miniscule um uh offenses and all of a sudden
[3:32:58.560 --> 3:33:04.560]  we were given that manifest to go out and find these people and i think out of may uh i was in
[3:33:04.560 --> 3:33:08.640]  uh special investigations at the time so we were assigned to do that and we pull these we pull
[3:33:08.640 --> 3:33:14.480]  these things we found out out of 30 we actually located one we felt like we were doing the right
[3:33:14.480 --> 3:33:21.600]  thing at that time obviously in the hindsight this 2020 now it's just it seems ridiculous to me
[3:33:21.600 --> 3:33:26.720]  that i thought i was doing the right thing i mean i'm violating this person's i mean we're not
[3:33:26.720 --> 3:33:31.680]  really violating the person's rights i mean that person would want you know be be processed
[3:33:32.400 --> 3:33:37.520]  but for a crooked toenail that you you were specifically being drawn off of serious cases
[3:33:37.520 --> 3:33:43.200]  put on these petty cases well that was what the well it was it was two or three days right after
[3:33:43.200 --> 3:33:50.320]  9 11 so i mean that was that was the case i mean there was the other 9 11 was the case i mean
[3:33:50.320 --> 3:33:54.240]  you would just all over the place well you know with with the Oklahoma City bombing and i appreciate
[3:33:54.240 --> 3:33:58.160]  your call it's good to hear from you again call back soon we're gonna go to some more calls here
[3:33:58.160 --> 3:34:03.840]  in a minute but uh what the fbi did is they went and investigated everything the dog catcher the
[3:34:03.840 --> 3:34:09.760]  butcher the candlestick maker they went after everybody to create the biggest mountain up until
[3:34:09.760 --> 3:34:14.880]  that point of investigations ever to get their good agents off the real trail and to create
[3:34:14.880 --> 3:34:21.680]  just this mountain of garbage uh jesse what do they call that tactic all i know is it's uh
[3:34:21.680 --> 3:34:25.040]  that's part of their tactic all the time is when they really want to cover it up they said look at
[3:34:25.040 --> 3:34:31.440]  our investigation we interviewed 10 000 witnesses and we have 100 000 documents obfuscation is what
[3:34:31.440 --> 3:34:37.200]  they do in in in the bombing case the agent in charge of the case after he retired said he was
[3:34:37.200 --> 3:34:42.800]  told the only time in his career he was told by main justice out of the white house clinton reno
[3:34:42.800 --> 3:34:49.200]  justice department not to go after the people at eliam city yeah all righty uh let's go ahead and
[3:34:49.200 --> 3:34:55.600]  talk to cody in georgia you're on the air with our guests go ahead cody yes sir i just had a question
[3:34:55.600 --> 3:35:01.360]  i was wanting to ask if uh actually i had two questions i want to ask you sir if you were able
[3:35:01.360 --> 3:35:07.760]  to subpoena the the uh federal guards or if they allowed you to do that or that judge you seem like
[3:35:07.760 --> 3:35:14.160]  a pretty reasonable yeah do you have an idea who killed your brother i don't i don't see one of the
[3:35:14.160 --> 3:35:19.600]  things under under the freedom of information act you requested is you can't you can't subpoena
[3:35:19.600 --> 3:35:31.760]  oh all you can do is is the judge can order them to i i have to focus on on nickels and the documents
[3:35:31.760 --> 3:35:36.640]  i asked for i can't go even though i that's where that road's going to take me i can't just jump
[3:35:36.640 --> 3:35:42.800]  ahead to there i have to go through the the process of fleshing out the bombing linking
[3:35:43.520 --> 3:35:47.520]  richard league guthrie who i think my brother was mistaken for to the bombing
[3:35:47.520 --> 3:35:53.440]  and and get there one step at a time i just can't jump over everything have you ever actually seen
[3:35:53.440 --> 3:35:59.760]  pictures of mr guthrie i have they look alike in my brother look alike oh me i had one more quick
[3:35:59.760 --> 3:36:05.280]  question i was wondering one of the john doze they had said was middle eastern looking and i was
[3:36:05.280 --> 3:36:10.880]  curious if you alex knew anything if it might have been the sod involved or something to that
[3:36:10.880 --> 3:36:17.600]  effect i don't know what the john doze was supposed to be all you know a lot of people that said
[3:36:17.600 --> 3:36:23.600]  there's a middle eastern connection i don't know i i don't i could tell you but everything i have
[3:36:23.600 --> 3:36:28.880]  seen all the fbi documents talk about homegrown folks and and government folks they always have
[3:36:28.880 --> 3:36:34.160]  covers and fallbacks they did have middle easterners they were caught at the airports with the blue
[3:36:34.160 --> 3:36:38.880]  jogging suits and the bomb making opponents but they weren't involved either they were only involved
[3:36:38.880 --> 3:36:43.840]  in a local cover to throw the media off the media was doing investigations of them and some of the
[3:36:43.840 --> 3:36:50.000]  people even involved in 9 11 on the outside so always in a black up they have multiple trends
[3:36:50.000 --> 3:36:56.880]  multiple patsy lines multiple angles they can go on and it was meant to be blamed on the american
[3:36:56.880 --> 3:37:02.000]  people and homegrown militias but they were ready to fall back with the whole middle easterner line
[3:37:02.000 --> 3:37:08.160]  as for israel you know israel has a lot a lot of evidence involved in the mu biotech so we cover
[3:37:08.160 --> 3:37:12.800]  that uh... in israel it's been in their papers that they've admittedly staged al-qaeda attacks in
[3:37:12.800 --> 3:37:20.560]  israel uh... you know it's a roster in post but then there's this whole crowd who just always says
[3:37:20.560 --> 3:37:27.280]  israel does everything it just just everything now it's another system run by the same globalist
[3:37:27.280 --> 3:37:30.960]  and they're very able intelligence groups so they do a lot of this evil but there are other
[3:37:30.960 --> 3:37:35.040]  groups the british do it the germans do it uh... the russians have been caught doing it this is
[3:37:35.040 --> 3:37:40.880]  what governments do it's a very nasty tactic and only by exposing it making false flag terror
[3:37:41.440 --> 3:37:46.880]  a household name can we finally stop these inside jobs and then all the political hay they get out
[3:37:46.880 --> 3:37:50.720]  of it the truth is really nobody's attacking us there's nothing going on everybody's scared of the
[3:37:50.720 --> 3:37:56.240]  u.s so the globalists have to go stage things as a way to oppress their own people or go attack
[3:37:56.240 --> 3:38:01.360]  other nations uh... we had the former head of pakistani intelligence on in a huge exclusive
[3:38:01.360 --> 3:38:05.360]  in the first hour if you missed it folks can be rearing in about twenty minutes
[3:38:05.360 --> 3:38:08.480]  at info wars dot com the only place you can hear it right now

[3:38:11.760 --> 3:38:17.440]  thank you for the call sir well let's go to steven illinois steven illinois you're on the air go ahead
[3:38:18.240 --> 3:38:25.120]  uh... yes i'm curious what is the strongest evidence you have to link this uh this situation
[3:38:25.120 --> 3:38:32.240]  to uh... the german intelligence uh... i i don't have that yet
[3:38:32.880 --> 3:38:37.040]  that's my understanding that's that's what i've sued to get the c i a report that i've been told
[3:38:37.040 --> 3:38:42.320]  exist well that's separate of the c i a report we know andres strawsmire's dad was the big top
[3:38:42.320 --> 3:38:46.240]  nazi we know he's in german intelligence we know he was allowed to leave the united states
[3:38:46.240 --> 3:38:51.120]  even though he's picked up by the justice department we know andres strawsmire was uh at
[3:38:51.120 --> 3:38:57.840]  alohim city uh... that's in all the fb i documents and that he was in the uh... the the the explosives
[3:38:57.840 --> 3:39:05.760]  maker working with mcvay correct job jessie trinidad well i i know that the c i a he was there
[3:39:05.760 --> 3:39:11.600]  he was the explosive instructors my understanding and the weapons instructor he does his father
[3:39:11.600 --> 3:39:17.760]  was high positioned in the german government and the fb i knew he was leaving after the bombing
[3:39:17.760 --> 3:39:24.320]  to mexico in the former c i a person is reported to have escorted the amount of the country and back

[3:39:32.720 --> 3:39:37.840]  he hung up i think that that guy calls i think he can't imagine somebody from germany could
[3:39:37.840 --> 3:39:42.720]  do something wrong there's another camp that's that that that the things germany is is pure
[3:39:42.720 --> 3:39:48.240]  pure uh... on everything it's uh... very strange uh... just like roiders admitted the germans
[3:39:48.240 --> 3:39:53.760]  were caught staging terror attacks last week and uh... it's very very odd uh... he he calls
[3:39:53.760 --> 3:39:57.840]  routinely though i think that's along the lines of what he was trying to say my i am
[3:39:57.840 --> 3:40:04.560]  crashed here john uh... giving the next caller please chris in florida okay chris in florida
[3:40:04.560 --> 3:40:08.960]  you're on the air welcome yes i'd like you to elaborate a little bit more on how the
[3:40:08.960 --> 3:40:12.640]  southern poverty law center had prior knowledge of uh... how they funded her
[3:40:12.640 --> 3:40:16.240]  on you know i knew about uh... you know him city because
[3:40:16.240 --> 3:40:20.800]  uh... if i could explain quickly i'm trying to expose them as the restators they are at my local
[3:40:20.800 --> 3:40:26.880]  well local non-commercial community supported radio station had mark potack on of the southern
[3:40:26.880 --> 3:40:33.200]  poverty law center i know he's written to you um... and uh... and on the one o'clock show on
[3:40:33.200 --> 3:40:39.600]  november 18th if you want to check out their archives uh... and then i got to confront him on
[3:40:39.600 --> 3:40:45.840]  the or try to confront him but uh... unfortunately well well well well potox written about me and
[3:40:45.840 --> 3:40:52.000]  they say there is no world government there is no north american union there is no trans texas
[3:40:52.000 --> 3:40:57.120]  corridor napta highways that matter if it's been in hundreds of newspapers the last two months
[3:40:57.120 --> 3:41:03.200]  doesn't matter if it's in the uh... financial times of london today
[3:41:03.200 --> 3:41:06.160]  that bring those let's put those articles up on screen
[3:41:06.160 --> 3:41:10.240]  uh... he doesn't matter they just say that it doesn't exist
[3:41:10.240 --> 3:41:15.360]  and uh... so jessie why don't you go over the fb i documents that uh... you know the specifics that
[3:41:15.360 --> 3:41:19.360]  basically the leadership of the elehime scene not see compound
[3:41:19.360 --> 3:41:25.920]  was basically southern poverty law correct all i know is the fb i documents referred to the southern
[3:41:25.920 --> 3:41:30.880]  poverty law center in southern poverty law center informants the southern poverty law center is
[3:41:30.880 --> 3:41:36.400]  denied that they were involved and can i swear they were i can't all i can tell you is that
[3:41:36.400 --> 3:41:42.720]  the fb i says they were at least the documents reference repeat my fully request
[3:41:44.000 --> 3:41:47.600]  uh... i mean the government came back with a hundred and fifty pages
[3:41:48.160 --> 3:41:52.720]  of documents were the southern poverty law centers mentioned with the fb i have almost
[3:41:52.720 --> 3:41:59.120]  almost every page and again the in fairness to them the southern poverty law center says it was
[3:41:59.120 --> 3:42:04.960]  enough and when i say well why in the hell with the fb i put your name on their documents
[3:42:06.160 --> 3:42:09.120]  if you weren't involved but do where they i don't know
[3:42:10.560 --> 3:42:14.000]  now i'm sure everything's fine i'm sure they haven't done anything wrong
[3:42:14.000 --> 3:42:16.560]  they're good people they just want to ban free speech in america
[3:42:17.200 --> 3:42:19.600]  and lie about good people and mix them in with horrible folks
[3:42:19.600 --> 3:42:26.320]  uh... anything else sir well yes it's interesting that uh... the person who responded or tried
[3:42:26.320 --> 3:42:32.240]  to rebut my state my referencing the salt lake city tribune articles here for the person
[3:42:32.240 --> 3:42:38.320]  uh... try and try to rebut my statements that that are referred to the listeners to the truth dig
[3:42:38.320 --> 3:42:43.600]  article where it does say that um... you know you know mark potock denied knowledge of prior
[3:42:43.600 --> 3:42:49.360]  knowledge it it says that uh... you know uh... even though a morris d's earlier uh... when asked at
[3:42:49.360 --> 3:42:54.400]  a meeting at southern uh... southeastern oklahoma state university whether his organization had any
[3:42:54.400 --> 3:43:00.480]  inside source at evil him city made no such denial rather he dodged the question acknowledging
[3:43:00.480 --> 3:43:05.360]  that his organization worked closely with the fb i another federal agencies but omitting any
[3:43:05.360 --> 3:43:10.720]  precise details sure let's be clear uh... they have their own informants inside that went back
[3:43:10.720 --> 3:43:15.520]  to the fb i said let's stop them and they would indict their own informants were trying to come
[3:43:15.520 --> 3:43:22.320]  fb i agents to shut them up well be nice if they would tell the truth because like you said it
[3:43:22.320 --> 3:43:28.400]  would serve them better all right appreciate the call who's up next after him john gloria and okay
[3:43:29.360 --> 3:43:38.160]  okay uh... gloria in oklahoma go ahead yes go ahead uh... my name is gloria chipman and i'm calling
[3:43:38.160 --> 3:43:43.840]  from oklahoma city i lost my husband in the oklahoma city bombing i'm sorry to hear that gloria
[3:43:43.840 --> 3:43:50.400]  thank you and we have a group here called both of the victims of terrorism information and vital
[3:43:50.400 --> 3:43:56.240]  exchange services uh... we initially started in august of two thousand and one trying to help
[3:43:56.240 --> 3:44:03.520]  the other family members and uh... survivors uh... they still needed counseling and uh...
[3:44:03.520 --> 3:44:08.560]  help with their bills and things and then uh... we heard about jessie trinadu and
[3:44:09.280 --> 3:44:13.520]  on the air i'd just like to say we are indebted to jessie trinadu for
[3:44:14.240 --> 3:44:20.320]  um... sharing with us information and passing it on and having it on various websites
[3:44:21.120 --> 3:44:29.680]  um... we would like to also ask your listeners if you would please contact your congressional
[3:44:29.680 --> 3:44:37.760]  representatives and the judiciary we're calling for congressional hearings with a special prosecutor
[3:44:37.760 --> 3:44:43.840]  into the oklahoma city bombing maybe they'll appoint eric holder because uh... janet reno
[3:44:43.840 --> 3:44:50.720]  appointed uh... uh... uh... the uh... deputy uh... a director of the weco probe was the person
[3:44:50.720 --> 3:44:57.040]  that ran weco so uh... yeah maybe they'll appoint uh... john goddy to investigate john goddy but
[3:44:57.040 --> 3:45:00.400]  no i mean i think it is a good idea to always call for investigations because even in white
[3:45:00.400 --> 3:45:05.200]  washes uh... things come out uh... uh... any comments on a new investigation
[3:45:05.200 --> 3:45:13.040]  jessie trinadu i don't think uh... mrs chipman i have been in contact for years now and and
[3:45:14.240 --> 3:45:20.800]  i don't want to rain on everybody's parade but the more the more former reno clinton justice
[3:45:20.800 --> 3:45:25.040]  apartment people we bring on board in this administration the less likely that is to happen
[3:45:25.040 --> 3:45:28.080]  uh...
[3:45:28.080 --> 3:45:32.640]  eric holder is not going to go back and open up to my brother's murder nor will he open up the
[3:45:32.640 --> 3:45:38.400]  oklahoma city bombing and but that doesn't mean that it can't be done through the state and and
[3:45:39.440 --> 3:45:43.840]  that's why we put the reward up for my brother's cases there are a lot of people who know what
[3:45:43.840 --> 3:45:50.560]  happened two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for information leading to uh... the the the uh...
[3:45:50.560 --> 3:45:56.000]  what what the identification and indictment or what of the the conviction of the fb i agency did this
[3:45:56.800 --> 3:46:02.640]  or the fb i operatives absolutely all right yeah well uh... gloria anything else sorry to hear
[3:46:02.640 --> 3:46:10.080]  about your husband well thank you uh... again happier like i believe you were jessie said earlier
[3:46:10.080 --> 3:46:16.560]  have your listeners right about eric holder right to your uh... congressman and and include the
[3:46:16.560 --> 3:46:21.680]  oklahoma city bombing and hearings that need to be done all right gloria good to hear from you and
[3:46:21.680 --> 3:46:27.200]  really again you know here i am on air uh... cynically uh... i'm trying to show people how
[3:46:27.200 --> 3:46:31.600]  corrupted is but cynically talking about i'm killing people and these are real people that was
[3:46:31.600 --> 3:46:38.720]  her husband uh... jessie trended is uh... brothers a real person murdered and uh... if they can
[3:46:38.720 --> 3:46:42.960]  murder them they can murder you and they can get away with that it'll be bigger next time and that's
[3:46:42.960 --> 3:46:47.520]  the whole point about corruption evil i'm gonna let you go jessie trying to do is new things develop
[3:46:47.520 --> 3:46:52.640]  please contact us again and i would love to break any other news or information you have any other

[3:47:15.600 --> 3:47:20.960]  thousand dollars for the f b i agents to kill my brother and uh... as i said there are lots of
[3:47:20.960 --> 3:47:26.160]  people who know what happened and that they just have no incentive to come forward or they're afraid
[3:47:26.160 --> 3:47:30.960]  to come forward and hopefully this money will give me incentive and the money's there i mean it's
[3:47:32.000 --> 3:47:36.000]  we we got enough from that judgment this is federal government money too
[3:47:36.000 --> 3:47:41.040]  you know we will we will never defeat the global is the new world order the corrupt
[3:47:41.040 --> 3:47:45.120]  the forces of darkness if good people don't stand up and fight back and you've done that and look
[3:47:45.120 --> 3:47:49.840]  at all the success you've had you've been through incredible tribulation uh... but we wouldn't have
[3:47:49.840 --> 3:47:54.160]  any liberty any freedom corruption would just run wild if it wasn't for good people throughout
[3:47:54.160 --> 3:47:58.080]  history fighting back against it so that's why we commend you jesse trying to do it was great

[3:49:51.120 --> 3:49:57.520]  and uh... you can see it they talk about how they want to get our guns our guns are a problem
[3:49:57.520 --> 3:50:03.040]  gotta get those guns those evil americans with guns how they've got to soothe us and how they've
[3:50:03.040 --> 3:50:10.400]  always soothed us deceptively to not let us know about it and if you just google new world order
[3:50:10.400 --> 3:50:14.880]  a few weeks ago i googled it on google news you know not on google video but for news stories
[3:50:15.440 --> 3:50:20.000]  there were thousands what five thousand four hundred hits hundreds and hundreds of day of
[3:50:20.000 --> 3:50:24.320]  mainstream news articles saying oh the world financial crisis it's so terrible we have to
[3:50:24.320 --> 3:50:31.920]  have world government to save us from it and that's what this says so the only deceptive part
[3:50:31.920 --> 3:50:37.440]  about it is that they're acting like they didn't stage the economic crisis when this very paper
[3:50:37.440 --> 3:50:47.440]  has admitted it was staged to consolidate banking and then they talk about how tyranny is good
[3:50:48.000 --> 3:50:54.000]  democracy has you know republics freedom has to be gotten rid of global government is real
[3:50:54.000 --> 3:51:00.400]  it's about global government taking our freedoms are good uh... they know best
[3:51:02.320 --> 3:51:06.080]  and and this is the most prestigious newspaper in the world financial times
[3:51:06.080 --> 3:51:10.080]  of london so we're going to come back

[3:51:19.600 --> 3:51:24.400]  and i want to challenge rush limbaugh and the rest of them to deal with this to face this
[3:51:25.440 --> 3:51:30.240]  but they can't i mean i mean they could have a world emperor on tv ruling everything
[3:51:30.240 --> 3:51:34.720]  everyone have to bow down to him ten times a day and limbaugh would say hey i just took
[3:51:34.720 --> 3:51:40.160]  twenty five oxy cottons there's no such thing and i'm sick of it i'm sick of these fake punks
[3:51:40.160 --> 3:51:48.560]  neutralizing conservatives here we go
[3:51:49.920 --> 3:51:55.760]  on the screen for prison planet dot tv members this will be ripped to the four corners of the
[3:51:55.760 --> 3:52:02.560]  web and that's great financial times of london and now for a world government and this is their foreign
[3:52:02.560 --> 3:52:07.440]  uh... an international affairs editor gideon
[3:52:10.240 --> 3:52:15.840]  rakeman and now for a world government now this isn't just the financial times of london the most
[3:52:15.840 --> 3:52:19.920]  prestigious newspaper in the world more than new york times more than the wall street journal the
[3:52:19.920 --> 3:52:25.120]  global paper of record this is this thing is subscribed to all the world uh... in here they
[3:52:25.120 --> 3:52:29.200]  admit uh... in previous articles that they engineered the financial collapse for big
[3:52:29.200 --> 3:52:32.720]  banks to take over smaller banks that they've cut off liquidity to the public
[3:52:32.720 --> 3:52:37.200]  to implode the world economy so the banks can consolidate i've read those articles and shown
[3:52:37.200 --> 3:52:42.000]  those to you as they bragged as they set this up the last three years and here again they just
[3:52:42.000 --> 3:52:47.680]  bragged that it's a world government they say that democracy will have to be gotten rid of
[3:52:47.680 --> 3:52:55.360]  that a world government uh... means that people won't have liberties anymore back here they talked
[3:52:55.360 --> 3:53:03.680]  to stainfully uh... about how you know the american people and their guns they own guns
[3:53:03.680 --> 3:53:08.640]  oh my god it's horrible they're gonna fight world government you know it's just terrible
[3:53:09.200 --> 3:53:14.880]  that we can't and they talk about how they soothingly have tried to deny world government
[3:53:14.880 --> 3:53:20.160]  so that we wouldn't get upset and they brag about how they use the word world governance
[3:53:20.160 --> 3:53:26.320]  because the public so stupid they don't know governance in the dictionary means government
[3:53:26.320 --> 3:53:31.680]  and they tell you oh you're an elite yuppie you're an elite person uh... you know you make
[3:53:31.680 --> 3:53:36.160]  a hundred grand a year you're you're a member of the elite you know global government doesn't exist
[3:53:36.720 --> 3:53:44.800]  rush limbaugh and uh... the liberal websites and not just the fake neocon ones the fake
[3:53:44.800 --> 3:53:49.040]  conservative ones but the little liberal websites huffington post in places
[3:53:49.040 --> 3:53:55.680]  oh none of that exists crazy it you're a racist it's code for racism you're like what is the
[3:53:55.680 --> 3:54:00.240]  code and will you just a racist we all know that world government doesn't exist and then and and
[3:54:00.240 --> 3:54:07.760]  that that's code for racism now paul watson another story about this that details it
[3:54:07.760 --> 3:54:13.200]  and uh... links to some other documents and articles uh... financial times editorial admits
[3:54:13.200 --> 3:54:18.800]  agenda predictorial world government jaw dropping report concedes the global governance is a
[3:54:18.800 --> 3:54:25.680]  euphemism for anti-democratic global government they're gonna take your roads your power plants
[3:54:25.680 --> 3:54:29.520]  privatize your your your local governments but that doesn't mean that they're actually gonna
[3:54:29.520 --> 3:54:34.400]  run things uh... you still pay taxes it's just that they'll double triple the prices
[3:54:34.400 --> 3:54:37.520]  and they're not paying to take over the it's just given to them
[3:54:37.520 --> 3:54:41.680]  so this is globalization and uh... there's paul watson's article about it again
[3:54:41.680 --> 3:54:45.680]  hundreds of newspapers every few days are saying world government the bankers will save you you'll
[3:54:45.680 --> 3:54:51.120]  pay carbon taxes uh... to them it's it's it's just going to be a valhalla i had the author
