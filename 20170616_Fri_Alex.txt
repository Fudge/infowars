[00:00:08.124 --> 00:00:14.594]  It's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:00:14.594 --> 00:00:17.338]  You better believe you got one!
[00:00:17.338 --> 00:00:24.067]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.496 --> 00:00:42.480]  Now for something completely different.
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:51.426]  Will NBC finally pull the plug on Megyn Kelly's controversial interview with radio personality and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones?
[00:00:51.426 --> 00:00:57.010]  Hey, so Megyn Kelly's been taking a lot of heat for interviewing radio show host Alex Jones.
[00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.352]  He is somebody who President Trump polled after the election to thank him.
[00:01:00.932 --> 00:01:04.116]  For his role, Trump had gone on his radio show during the campaign.
[00:01:04.116 --> 00:01:12.426]  Kelly and NBC are now under fire for giving airtime to the radio talk show host who has called the Sandy Hook school shooting a hoax.
[00:01:12.426 --> 00:01:14.869]  Megyn Kelly is jumping right back into the deep end.
[00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:20.496]  As NBC plans to air a sit-down interview with conspiracy hack Alex Jones this Sunday.
[00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:26.346]  Mr. Jones doesn't talk to a lot of reporters, but we're very glad he made an exception.
[00:01:26.346 --> 00:01:32.654]  When you say parents faked their children's death, people get very angry.
[00:01:32.654 --> 00:01:38.142]  Yeah, well, that's all I know, but they don't get angry about the half million that I racked up from the sanctions, or they don't get angry about all these legal... That's a dodge.
[00:01:38.502 --> 00:01:39.884]  No, no, it was not a dodge.
[00:01:39.884 --> 00:01:43.329]  The media never covers all the evil wars it's promoted, all the big things.
[00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:45.593]  That doesn't excuse what you did and said about Newtown.
[00:01:45.593 --> 00:01:46.414]  You know it.
[00:01:46.414 --> 00:01:47.736]  Here's the difference.
[00:01:47.736 --> 00:01:54.186]  I looked at all the angles of Newtown, and I made my statements long before the media even picked up on it.
[00:01:54.306 --> 00:01:56.447]  I think Alex Jones is disgusting.
[00:01:56.447 --> 00:01:58.049]  I think the things he says are awful.
[00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.229]  He makes me physically sick.
[00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:07.755]  With that being said, he does have the ear of the president, and he has six million people that listen to him, and I would like people out there to know that there is a segment of the population that's drawn to this.
[00:02:07.755 --> 00:02:11.037]  We have a problem in this country, and I would like him to be exposed.
[00:02:11.037 --> 00:02:15.940]  This is a nasty man that has harassed the parents of dead children.
[00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.064]  I don't think you give him a platform to more than the six million people that already follow him.
[00:02:21.064 --> 00:02:22.645]  It's not so much that NBC is
[00:02:23.445 --> 00:02:24.025]  No I didn't, Lemon!
[00:02:44.097 --> 00:02:48.820]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:57.304]  The fact is that he is an unalloyed racist, a man who's out there pulling the pin on the grenade every day, and he has six million viewers.
[00:02:57.304 --> 00:03:00.466]  Why give him the notoriety that he obviously craves?
[00:03:00.466 --> 00:03:02.127]  Well, the thing is, he already has that, though.
[00:03:02.127 --> 00:03:03.268]  Six million people find him.
[00:03:04.368 --> 00:03:09.232]  Like, that disgusts me more, what it says about the people that would choose to follow someone like that.
[00:03:09.232 --> 00:03:10.032]  Well, the president follows him.
[00:03:10.032 --> 00:03:10.773]  But it says exactly what I did.
[00:03:10.773 --> 00:03:12.594]  Would you give Donald Trump air time?
[00:03:12.594 --> 00:03:17.397]  Over the years, John, as you know, journalists have interviewed murderers and rapists and child molesters.
[00:03:17.397 --> 00:03:20.859]  I mean, the anchors interviewed Saddam Hussein, Charles Manson, O.J.
[00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:21.280]  Simpson.
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.901]  So, this is part of what we do.
[00:03:22.901 --> 00:03:33.668]  NBC is taking a huge gamble Sunday night, maintaining her sit-down with controversial conspiracy theorists and InfoWars host Alex Jones will air in spite of the uproar.
[00:03:34.148 --> 00:03:35.069]  Sandy Hook.
[00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:40.091]  Well, Sandy Hook's complex because I've had debates where we've doubled as advocates and the whole story's true.
[00:03:40.091 --> 00:03:43.833]  And I've had debates where I've said that none of it's true.
[00:03:43.833 --> 00:03:48.735]  I'm told multiple advertisers have said to NBC, we don't want to be anywhere near this story.
[00:03:48.735 --> 00:03:50.816]  The network won't say exactly how many.
[00:03:50.816 --> 00:03:54.959]  JPMorgan Chase is the only advertiser that we know is avoiding Megyn Kelly's show.
[00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:57.599]  Burned down Adam Lance's house.
[00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:59.700]  Sandy Hook didn't happen.
[00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:05.801]  When I explained to her both sides of it, and I explained that I only had debates, and looked at the full story.
[00:04:05.801 --> 00:04:10.723]  It's not gonna be some gotcha hit piece, I promise you that.
[00:04:10.723 --> 00:04:24.186]  If you are resuming this transition, you are the Resistance.
[00:04:26.877 --> 00:04:30.601]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:04:30.601 --> 00:04:33.644]  Mainstream corporate-owned media does not control the paradigm anymore.
[00:04:34.455 --> 00:04:45.519]  They got us into a war that killed millions of people over the years, claiming a bunch of babies got killed at a hospital, and none of it was true, then we have a right to question everything that comes out of MSM.
[00:04:45.519 --> 00:04:51.781]  Does it mean we hate the families of the victims at Newtown, which I tend to believe that attack probably happened.
[00:04:51.781 --> 00:04:53.082]  Mass shootings do happen.
[00:04:53.082 --> 00:04:58.544]  And they tried to use it, the government and the media did, to take our guns and blame America for those murders.
[00:04:58.544 --> 00:04:59.384]  That's fake news.
[00:05:01.107 --> 00:05:08.689]  While the anti-American, anti-Trump Democrats are looking up each other's rear ends for Trump-Russia collusion, the real collusion is hiding in plain sight.
[00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:13.571]  It should have come as no surprise when Comey didn't prosecute Hillary Clinton for the illegal email and server scandal.
[00:05:13.571 --> 00:05:15.051]  Comey and Clinton had a history.
[00:05:15.051 --> 00:05:21.313]  In 2004, while serving as Deputy Attorney General to the Justice Department, Comey narrowed the scope of the Sandy Berger investigation
[00:05:21.553 --> 00:05:27.179]  To seclude members of the Clinton administration who may have coordinated with Berger in the destruction of classified documents.
[00:05:27.179 --> 00:05:33.866]  Berger, Cheryl Mills, and now disgraced Loretta Lynch all worked together at the law firm that handled Clinton's tax returns.
[00:05:33.866 --> 00:05:38.391]  No wonder why Lynch didn't want Clinton's emails to be investigated or prosecuted.
[00:05:38.391 --> 00:05:44.057]  You throw that in with the fact Comey admitted he's the leaker, and well, we have a new investigation to focus on, don't we?
[00:05:44.537 --> 00:05:49.580]  No, we don't, because the Trump administration is busy trying to make America great again.
[00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:58.164]  But perhaps someday, a real investigation into real collusion will make it to Capitol Hill, and Lynch and Clinton will have their days to testify under oath.
[00:05:58.164 --> 00:06:00.325]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[00:06:00.925 --> 00:06:11.538]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:06:11.538 --> 00:06:13.600]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.463]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[00:06:16.463 --> 00:06:17.965]  It's made in the USA.
[00:06:17.965 --> 00:06:21.089]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are
[00:06:21.309 --> 00:06:24.752]  Absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[00:06:24.752 --> 00:06:26.854]  It is a classical 360 win.
[00:06:26.854 --> 00:06:36.562]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[00:06:36.562 --> 00:06:48.873]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America,
[00:06:49.053 --> 00:06:53.356]  To reignite those brush fires to the next level, and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[00:06:53.356 --> 00:06:56.659]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[00:06:56.659 --> 00:06:59.962]  Now it's time to change our bodies, with Z-Shield, at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:07:04.645 --> 00:07:15.072]  Off and on, trying to get a big national brand that's already trusted to let us private label an entire line of personal care products that's organic, high quality.
[00:07:15.072 --> 00:07:24.217]  This is one of the top three selling organic brands in the country that puts out high quality organic shampoo, mouthwash, you name it.
[00:07:24.217 --> 00:07:28.860]  And they're such patriots, they have let us basically keep their well-known packaging.
[00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:31.262]  It is an answer to prayer, and because we're cutting out the middleman,
[00:07:31.682 --> 00:07:35.965]  20% off retail, sign up for auto ship, an additional 25% off.
[00:07:35.965 --> 00:07:37.106]  It's all there.
[00:07:37.106 --> 00:07:42.550]  The body wash, the shampoo, the deodorant, the mouthwash, all of it is truly game-changing.
[00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:53.277]  It is the exact same product, just the name is different, Emrix Essentials, and it's on average 20% off what it would be in stores, buying it directly from InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:07:53.277 --> 00:07:55.899]  Help us win the Info War while getting products everybody needs.
[00:07:55.899 --> 00:07:59.962]  InfoWarsLife.com, where you'll find the entire line of Emrix Essentials.
[00:08:06.567 --> 00:08:08.349]  Stand up and be counted.
[00:08:08.349 --> 00:08:15.896]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:08:15.896 --> 00:08:17.057]  Rallying patriots.
[00:08:17.057 --> 00:08:23.463]  Rallying patriots worldwide.
[00:08:23.463 --> 00:08:26.105]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:28.277 --> 00:08:30.101]  Get ready for another attack.
[00:08:30.101 --> 00:08:36.355]  We're going in, discrediting the globalists, the fake news media, the foreign megabanks that have hijacked the country.
[00:08:38.004 --> 00:08:57.274]  I was talking to some pretty heavy hitters today about what's happening in DC and what's happening in Silicon Valley and happening in other areas of the nation and how the big banks behind the scenes openly are rooting to stop Trump and to shut down our infrastructure and to de-industrialize America.
[00:08:57.274 --> 00:09:04.638]  And then one of the astute people I was talking to, a very successful woman, very smart lady, who of course won't say her name,
[00:09:08.274 --> 00:09:14.395]  Pointed out that that's what people can't stand anymore in the halls of power, is just the hatred of America.
[00:09:14.395 --> 00:09:19.657]  And it makes people who've never even really been political go, why do you hate America so bad?
[00:09:19.657 --> 00:09:21.577]  Why do you want to make everybody poor?
[00:09:21.577 --> 00:09:23.558]  Why do you root against the country?
[00:09:23.558 --> 00:09:34.620]  And this lady pointed out, she said, I listen all the time, but I noticed you didn't talk about this a few weeks ago, and you really should.
[00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:37.021]  And that's the fact that Goldman Sachs head
[00:09:39.175 --> 00:09:42.618]  Who's never tweeted.
[00:09:42.618 --> 00:09:45.661]  Suddenly has started going active with five tweets.
[00:09:45.661 --> 00:09:48.043]  Lloyd Blankfein.
[00:09:48.043 --> 00:09:51.726]  Who, if Hillary was president, Lloyd Blankfein would be president.
[00:09:51.726 --> 00:09:54.789]  Goldman Sachs is the most powerful institution in the world.
[00:09:54.789 --> 00:09:55.970]  It's the top of the pyramid.
[00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:57.771]  Right under that's JPMorgan.
[00:09:57.771 --> 00:09:59.413]  But it's the same group, basically.
[00:09:59.413 --> 00:10:00.974]  JPMorgan's British intelligence.
[00:10:00.974 --> 00:10:03.376]  At least that's what founded it.
[00:10:03.376 --> 00:10:04.958]  Goldman Sachs is a consortium of
[00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:12.044]  New York socialists and others that got together openly over a hundred years ago and said they were going to take over banking.
[00:10:12.044 --> 00:10:24.332]  But I was reading his tweets where he makes fun of Trump and makes fun of Trump trying to reboot American infrastructure and says China's is incredible, it's much better than ours.
[00:10:24.332 --> 00:10:27.654]  And I just got back from there.
[00:10:27.654 --> 00:10:28.995]  And you're going to fail, basically.
[00:10:30.666 --> 00:10:38.888]  Arrived in China, as always, impressed by condition of airport roads, cell service, except US needs to invest in infrastructure to keep up.
[00:10:38.888 --> 00:10:40.628]  Then he makes a joke to Trump.
[00:10:40.628 --> 00:10:42.809]  Oh, how's infrastructure going for you there?
[00:10:42.809 --> 00:10:43.469]  Ha ha!
[00:10:43.469 --> 00:10:50.050]  Because the globalists have intended to sell us out to China and leverage us out.
[00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:52.251]  And that's why they don't want us to have cheap energy.
[00:10:52.251 --> 00:10:53.951]  That's why they don't want us to have factory jobs.
[00:10:53.951 --> 00:10:54.491]  That's why.
[00:10:54.491 --> 00:10:57.332]  Because the globalists hate America.
[00:10:57.332 --> 00:10:58.992]  Hollywood hates America.
[00:11:02.796 --> 00:11:05.478]  And people are sick of it.
[00:11:05.478 --> 00:11:13.744]  And then you've got the leftist throngs on the street who are the most illiberal, anti-liberal people on the planet.
[00:11:13.744 --> 00:11:15.365]  These definitions mean nothing.
[00:11:15.365 --> 00:11:16.185]  They want control.
[00:11:16.185 --> 00:11:17.466]  They want to say what words you can use.
[00:11:17.466 --> 00:11:19.067]  They want to totally tax.
[00:11:19.067 --> 00:11:21.109]  They want people poor.
[00:11:21.109 --> 00:11:28.834]  The WikiLeaks are just full of the Democrat leaders talking about keeping the public in the dark and desperate and hopeless.
[00:11:28.834 --> 00:11:31.796]  Sounds like serial killers, you know, they've got kids locked up or something.
[00:11:34.991 --> 00:11:46.674]  And they're panicking because despite everything they've thrown at Trump and, you know, removing in the sample 9 to 15 points against him, he's got a 50% in the major Gallup poll.
[00:11:46.674 --> 00:11:49.355]  Means he's more like 60-65.
[00:11:49.355 --> 00:11:50.775]  And they are scared.
[00:11:50.775 --> 00:11:54.676]  They're throwing everything they've got and it's failing.
[00:11:54.676 --> 00:11:56.476]  So here comes the conspiracy theory.
[00:11:56.476 --> 00:11:58.337]  Oh, it's not Russia collusion.
[00:11:59.605 --> 00:12:10.208]  No, the president obstructed justice, even though in the unitary executive he could basically do whatever he wanted, because he's only responsible to the voters.
[00:12:10.208 --> 00:12:18.710]  And Alan Dershowitz, a Democrat, is clear on that, as long as he's not involved in sedition against the country.
[00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:26.672]  And then, of course, the Comey memo didn't have Trump in it, obstructed.
[00:12:26.672 --> 00:12:28.793]  But see, they don't care.
[00:12:30.452 --> 00:12:38.485]  They're going to continue and they're hiring an army of lawyers, all of them basically Democrat operatives, as the deep state prepares.
[00:12:39.841 --> 00:12:42.102]  To try to bring down our president.
[00:12:42.102 --> 00:12:43.203]  They are the usurpers.
[00:12:43.203 --> 00:12:44.343]  They are the hijackers.
[00:12:44.343 --> 00:12:46.424]  And there's a battle over the wheel.
[00:12:46.424 --> 00:12:48.105]  Controlling the ship of state.
[00:12:48.105 --> 00:12:53.027]  With the foreign outside globalists that openly have de-industrialized this nation.
[00:12:53.027 --> 00:12:56.609]  To make us poor and to be able to control us and put us on welfare and run our lives.
[00:12:56.609 --> 00:12:58.990]  And they write white papers and textbooks on it.
[00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:00.071]  Cloward and Piven.
[00:13:00.071 --> 00:13:02.892]  They admit the whole thing!
[00:13:02.892 --> 00:13:07.254]  And then they come with their conspiracy theory that I'm commanding the Russians now.
[00:13:07.254 --> 00:13:08.715]  Remember Hillary two weeks ago?
[00:13:10.438 --> 00:13:13.181]  She said, oh, the Russians, they couldn't come up with this on their own.
[00:13:13.181 --> 00:13:17.266]  There's groups here in America that create the talking points.
[00:13:17.266 --> 00:13:25.256]  InfoWars, and then Putin has the bots attack, and then coordinated InfoWars then releases the information.
[00:13:25.256 --> 00:13:26.318]  Wow, lady.
[00:13:26.318 --> 00:13:26.918]  And you know what?
[00:13:26.918 --> 00:13:27.719]  In a way, it's true.
[00:13:28.922 --> 00:13:32.845]  Because I am creating the talking points, but I didn't invent them.
[00:13:32.845 --> 00:13:38.490]  I just dug them up out of the ash heap of history that you thought was long gone and defeated.
[00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:41.052]  Classic renaissance, classic Americana.
[00:13:41.052 --> 00:13:49.239]  And it's so sexy compared to what you're selling, austerity and race war and garbage and shooting cops in the back of the head.
[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:55.062]  Bringing in illegals by the millions and not even testing them for diseases when it hurts them and us?
[00:13:55.062 --> 00:14:10.149]  I mean, you are a bunch of selfish, evil people that think being monsters is an art form and have convinced yourself because you hijacked our banking system and hijacked our industry and sold it out to parlay your power into global government.
[00:14:12.585 --> 00:14:22.750]  But now the world knows about your corporate world government and your carbon taxes and everyone's starting to resist it and your problems are going to get bigger and bigger by the minute.
[00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:26.711]  There's no putting the genie back in the bottle now.
[00:14:26.711 --> 00:14:31.554]  As Peter Thiel said, the tide of globalism is going out.
[00:14:31.554 --> 00:14:33.775]  You are swimming against the tide of history.
[00:14:33.775 --> 00:14:34.355]  There is
[00:14:36.693 --> 00:14:43.050]  A tide in the affairs of men when taken at the flood leads on to fortune, Julius Caesar.
[00:14:45.663 --> 00:14:47.784]  Shakespeare's Julius Caesar.
[00:14:47.784 --> 00:15:01.471]  And you see how they root against America in the New York Times and the Daily Beast saying, and the worst thing Alex Jones did is he put out a fake clip of Comey saying that the president never tried to influence him or nobody else did.
[00:15:01.471 --> 00:15:02.251]  And it's fake!
[00:15:02.251 --> 00:15:04.452]  And then a stock market went up!
[00:15:04.452 --> 00:15:10.255]  We had it declining and it went up and we called the head of the NY stock market and they said it was Jones!
[00:15:10.255 --> 00:15:12.776]  It was a clip he sent out!
[00:15:12.776 --> 00:15:13.357]  It was fake!
[00:15:14.667 --> 00:15:30.382]  And these savages are so crazy, so out of control, that have hijacked this nation, that they think you're so stupid, they put out transcripts of what we aired and said it was fake.
[00:15:30.382 --> 00:15:31.103]  That's bold!
[00:15:32.904 --> 00:15:46.869]  And they say I'm fake news because they take the fact that we have wide discussions when my listeners almost lynched me when the Sandy Hook shootings took place because I didn't immediately jump on it and say it was a false flag.
[00:15:46.869 --> 00:15:49.170]  When we see evidence of false flag, we cover it.
[00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:50.150]  Was the media ready?
[00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:51.030]  Did they pounce on it?
[00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:52.491]  Did they blame gun owners?
[00:15:52.491 --> 00:15:54.111]  That's outrageous!
[00:15:54.111 --> 00:16:00.454]  To blame our veterans that have fought for the Second Amendment and citizens and say that we're at fault for some Prozac head
[00:16:01.494 --> 00:16:05.878]  With a semi-automatic rifle reportedly going and shooting people.
[00:16:05.878 --> 00:16:14.046]  And then all the anomalies and the babies in the incubators being killed to take us to war and all the other fake things media's done.
[00:16:14.046 --> 00:16:15.908]  Of course people question that.
[00:16:15.908 --> 00:16:21.353]  Of course we question a government that's engaged in hoax after hoax after hoax.
[00:16:21.353 --> 00:16:25.798]  But that doesn't mean we hate people that have lost children in mass shootings once they're investigated.
[00:16:27.105 --> 00:16:38.013]  Now some of the families, I guess, really I think it's more like a law firm, the Democratic Party, he's saying they want to sue Megyn Kelly for interviewing me, that I'm so evil.
[00:16:38.013 --> 00:16:46.940]  You can interview Jeffrey Dahmer, you can interview Adolf Hitler in Time Magazine, you can interview Saddam Hussein, but you don't interview Alex Jones.
[00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:49.222]  And why is that?
[00:16:49.222 --> 00:16:50.823]  Because they fear us so much.
[00:16:52.742 --> 00:16:57.483]  That they don't want people to even see me, so they might actually come hear what I actually have to say.
[00:16:57.483 --> 00:16:59.144]  But what a joke!
[00:16:59.144 --> 00:17:02.265]  We don't need the platform of this show.
[00:17:02.265 --> 00:17:08.446]  This firestorm is a hundred times bigger, two hundred times, than the show.
[00:17:08.446 --> 00:17:18.729]  And they meant to destroy us and set a precedent to go out for free speech and say, you know, there's the Alex Jones standard, and it's so bad that, you know, it's just speech that is illegal.
[00:17:19.878 --> 00:17:26.963]  And then they build a strawman of what I've said so they can crucify me on lies.
[00:17:26.963 --> 00:17:30.625]  And remember, when they can crucify me politically, they can crucify you.
[00:17:30.625 --> 00:17:31.946]  And that's what this is all about.
[00:17:31.946 --> 00:17:33.507]  It's about destroying Trump.
[00:17:33.507 --> 00:17:34.768]  It's about destroying Americana.
[00:17:34.768 --> 00:17:39.571]  It's about destroying the American reboot that's here and happening now.
[00:17:39.571 --> 00:17:41.513]  Prosperity versus austerity.
[00:17:41.513 --> 00:17:43.134]  Freedom versus slavery.
[00:17:43.134 --> 00:17:44.395]  And the choice is up to you.
[00:17:46.912 --> 00:17:48.673]  I'm not one that really hypes things up.
[00:17:48.673 --> 00:17:50.793]  I always just start giving you the news right up front.
[00:17:50.793 --> 00:17:55.394]  But we will be at the bottom of the hour, skipping the 50 break for stations out there.
[00:17:55.394 --> 00:17:59.456]  That's a network break, so nobody should play their ads there.
[00:17:59.456 --> 00:18:06.557]  We're going to air the 27-minute piece that Rob Dude put together of just part of phone calls with Megyn Kelly.
[00:18:06.557 --> 00:18:09.478]  And then, yes, we do have the interview.
[00:18:09.478 --> 00:18:13.159]  We do have at least one portion of it.
[00:18:13.159 --> 00:18:15.140]  The two hours almost, they interviewed me at some
[00:18:16.954 --> 00:18:19.996]  The House in the Texas Hill Country is some CIA substation.
[00:18:19.996 --> 00:18:21.257]  And I'm not joking when I say that.
[00:18:21.257 --> 00:18:22.998]  It was just spook central.
[00:18:22.998 --> 00:18:27.521]  This is a total deep state operation against myself, against Trump.
[00:18:27.521 --> 00:18:30.983]  It's a level of propaganda rollout like you see before a major war.
[00:18:30.983 --> 00:18:31.964]  Because it is a war.
[00:18:31.964 --> 00:18:33.365]  It's a war on America.
[00:18:33.365 --> 00:18:34.646]  It's a war on you.
[00:18:34.646 --> 00:18:36.307]  It's a war on prosperity.
[00:18:36.307 --> 00:18:39.229]  It's a war on freedom.
[00:18:39.229 --> 00:18:42.191]  It is a war to promote racism and division.
[00:18:42.191 --> 00:18:44.973]  They're all over the news saying, yes, it is a civil war.
[00:18:44.973 --> 00:18:46.834]  Hashtag hunt Republicans.
[00:18:47.754 --> 00:18:52.197]  And top Democratic strategists are saying, let's go, let's start killing.
[00:18:52.197 --> 00:18:57.800]  And they believe we're all going to roll over to the political correctness.
[00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:01.201]  Well, Blitzer, you know, has guests on going, he wasn't evil, he was just upset.
[00:19:01.201 --> 00:19:03.042]  Well, Blitzer's like, yep, nodding with the guy.
[00:19:03.042 --> 00:19:04.023]  Yeah, that's right, yeah.
[00:19:04.023 --> 00:19:07.885]  We'll shoot that congressman, we'll fight for his life, shoot a couple cops, shoot some other people.
[00:19:07.885 --> 00:19:10.766]  Just, oh, it's just your opinion, yeah, okay.
[00:19:10.766 --> 00:19:15.909]  They're the ones calling for violence, then they turn around and say that, I mean, it's almost like I killed the kids at Newtown.
[00:19:20.014 --> 00:19:23.177]  I killed the kids in Iraq.
[00:19:23.177 --> 00:19:27.861]  I'm the reason kids are coming across from Mexico with tuberculosis and leprosy.
[00:19:27.861 --> 00:19:30.384]  Hell, didn't you know there's a new name for Satan?
[00:19:30.384 --> 00:19:35.128]  It's Alexander Emmerich Jones, the name of the devil himself.
[00:19:35.128 --> 00:19:44.396]  According to the fake media that lied to you about WMDs and the millions of dead Iraqis swallowed into oblivion and turned over to radical Islamists because people like
[00:19:45.307 --> 00:19:48.893]  Tom Brokaw assisted in the lie that led to the mass murder.
[00:19:48.893 --> 00:19:55.783]  That swallower of millions of souls, that cheerleader of death, calls me a quote, total racist.
[00:19:55.783 --> 00:20:00.391]  No, Tom Brokaw, you have been reporting fake news since the Hindenburg.
[00:20:01.041 --> 00:20:05.483]  Hi, this is Ron Paul, former congressman and Republican presidential candidate.
[00:20:05.483 --> 00:20:13.448]  I love these summer months because this is when I get to enjoy the fresh fruits and vegetables that are being harvested on small farms and in our backyards.
[00:20:13.448 --> 00:20:16.449]  We all look forward to garden tomatoes and corn on the cob.
[00:20:16.449 --> 00:20:20.451]  Don't you wish there was a better way to preserve their true taste and flavors?
[00:20:20.451 --> 00:20:23.133]  I'm here to tell you that there is a better way.
[00:20:23.133 --> 00:20:26.815]  It's by using the amazing Home Freeze Dryer from Harvest Right.
[00:20:27.495 --> 00:20:31.480]  I have a Harvest Right freeze dryer and use it to preserve the foods I love.
[00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:36.707]  Strawberries, apples, and even lasagna and ice cream can stay fresh for 25 years.
[00:20:36.707 --> 00:20:42.535]  And the best part of my freeze drying is my family and I have a supply of long-lasting food on hand.
[00:20:42.535 --> 00:20:45.358]  So no matter what may come, we feel better prepared.
[00:20:45.859 --> 00:20:47.580]  We love our freeze dryer.

[00:20:53.222 --> 00:20:54.002]  You're on the air.
[00:21:04.915 --> 00:21:05.375]  Great!
[00:21:05.375 --> 00:21:06.517]  Hey, thank you so much.
[00:21:06.517 --> 00:21:11.161]  Listen, I have bought your products, and I gotta say, they're amazing.
[00:21:11.161 --> 00:21:12.902]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it.
[00:21:12.902 --> 00:21:21.490]  Because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret Swell, Plasma Interfusion, I've got the Body Armor... Wow, thank you.

[00:21:23.932 --> 00:21:25.514]  Which nutraceutical does he like best?
[00:21:25.774 --> 00:21:29.336]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion to be honest.
[00:21:29.336 --> 00:21:29.856]  That's amazing.
[00:21:29.856 --> 00:21:30.636]  That's really incredible.
[00:21:30.636 --> 00:21:33.778]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you I felt incredible.
[00:21:33.778 --> 00:21:35.159]  Like I haven't felt sleep.
[00:21:35.159 --> 00:21:36.839]  My morning was fantastic.
[00:21:36.839 --> 00:21:38.120]  And I love you guys.
[00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:40.361]  I love the Info Wars crew.
[00:21:40.361 --> 00:21:46.164]  And I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence.

[00:21:47.344 --> 00:21:48.425]  You will love it.

[00:22:59.264 --> 00:23:03.727]  It's been said, any society is only three missed meals away from chaos.
[00:23:03.727 --> 00:23:05.328]  Those times may be near.
[00:23:05.328 --> 00:23:05.869]  Think about it.
[00:23:06.209 --> 00:23:10.832]  Our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia and North Korea.
[00:23:10.832 --> 00:23:15.814]  Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns.
[00:23:15.814 --> 00:23:21.638]  And our crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages from a single cyber attack.
[00:23:21.638 --> 00:23:28.341]  When the chaos from any one of these threats arises, the government knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency.
[00:23:28.341 --> 00:23:30.883]  That's why you need your own plan for self-reliance.
[00:23:31.323 --> 00:23:34.125]  That's where My Patriot Supply comes in.

[00:24:04.767 --> 00:24:06.268]  Alex Jones here, back live.
[00:24:06.268 --> 00:24:17.417]  Coming up, when we kick off the next segment, I'm going to have time enough to air about 90% of the exclusive, behind-the-scenes, Megyn Kelly leaked interview.
[00:24:17.417 --> 00:24:28.345]  And I love how NBC and others are talking about suing me, while they've got, reportedly, some law firm that represents some of the families threatening to sue Megyn Kelly.
[00:24:28.345 --> 00:24:32.388]  If she puts this interview out, it's amazing.
[00:24:33.868 --> 00:24:36.169]  That would be the end of the First Amendment.
[00:24:36.169 --> 00:24:40.810]  Kelly was always doing a vicious, deceptive, investigative report.
[00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:44.071]  60-minute style.
[00:24:44.071 --> 00:24:54.334]  Her flagging failed career, her tanked ratings on Fox, her tanking ratings on NBC, is emblematic of the whole dinosaur media collapsing.
[00:24:54.334 --> 00:24:58.375]  So she wanted to rehabilitate herself, and she was totally fake.
[00:24:59.471 --> 00:25:00.572]  On the phone, I knew it was fake.
[00:25:00.572 --> 00:25:01.613]  I told her she was being fake.
[00:25:01.613 --> 00:25:03.854]  You can hear me say that to her.
[00:25:03.854 --> 00:25:05.616]  And I kind of polished the apple a little bit, too.
[00:25:05.616 --> 00:25:07.818]  You know, I said, oh yeah, I'm a fan of yours.
[00:25:07.818 --> 00:25:10.219]  And she wasn't bad at news reading, you know, six, seven years ago.
[00:25:10.219 --> 00:25:16.204]  I didn't dislike Megyn Kelly.
[00:25:16.204 --> 00:25:21.408]  But the reason it's important is they've thrown everything they can against me.
[00:25:21.408 --> 00:25:24.751]  And even MSM admits it's all blown up in their face at every point.
[00:25:26.032 --> 00:25:29.579]  And they got all these articles saying Jones is the master media tactician.
[00:25:29.579 --> 00:25:33.526]  No I'm not!
[00:25:33.526 --> 00:25:36.111]  I go into this with an open heart.
[00:25:36.111 --> 00:25:36.993]  And I just trust in God.
[00:25:40.515 --> 00:25:43.018]  So it's more like sleepwalking.
[00:25:43.018 --> 00:25:48.343]  It's not, you know, I didn't say the things they said the way I said them about Sandy Hook.
[00:25:48.343 --> 00:25:50.205]  I'm not the man they say I am.
[00:25:50.205 --> 00:25:51.566]  I know who I am.
[00:25:51.566 --> 00:25:52.728]  I care.
[00:25:52.728 --> 00:25:54.590]  And I do my research and I try to tell the truth.
[00:25:54.590 --> 00:26:00.676]  And it's hard to know the truth on things when you're dealing with the media and a government that lies so much.
[00:26:00.676 --> 00:26:01.337]  They're the reason.
[00:26:02.335 --> 00:26:09.617]  We can't believe anything comes out of MSM because they've lied so much and they want to turn that around and say, I'm the liar and they want to destroy me.
[00:26:09.617 --> 00:26:15.198]  And so many people think the safe move in the world is to ride the fence and to go along to get along.
[00:26:15.198 --> 00:26:16.598]  That leads to stagnation.
[00:26:16.598 --> 00:26:17.939]  That leads to destruction.
[00:26:17.939 --> 00:26:21.740]  That leads to North Korea.
[00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:24.280]  I want to be somebody that changes the world for better.
[00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:25.941]  I want to be attacked by scum.
[00:26:25.941 --> 00:26:26.881]  I want to take them on.
[00:26:28.581 --> 00:26:33.963]  I want to change the world and I'm doing it because of your support and your prayers.
[00:26:33.963 --> 00:26:38.284]  So again, I want to encourage listeners, spread the word, spread the articles, spread the videos.
[00:26:38.284 --> 00:26:41.625]  The enemy won't even quote me in the news.
[00:26:41.625 --> 00:26:53.008]  They won't even say what I'm actually saying in almost all these publications because they want to build that straw man to project it onto you.
[00:26:53.008 --> 00:26:56.069]  Just like they project mass shootings that are getting more and more rare.
[00:26:56.069 --> 00:26:57.150]  They're actually down from the 90s.
[00:26:58.581 --> 00:27:03.503]  One of the rarest forms of death is to die in a mass shooting, and most of them are gang-related, and it's terrible.
[00:27:03.503 --> 00:27:05.424]  But it's very rare.
[00:27:05.424 --> 00:27:10.745]  And they're projecting that on the gun owners, and veterans, and patriots, and we shouldn't put up with that.
[00:27:10.745 --> 00:27:13.446]  Law-abiding gun owners make the crime rate go down.
[00:27:13.446 --> 00:27:15.267]  Concealed carry makes the crime rate go down.
[00:27:15.267 --> 00:27:19.609]  We're tired of your boycotts, your harassment, your bullying.
[00:27:19.609 --> 00:27:25.331]  I've got a stack of news here with top Democrats everywhere saying, hunt Republicans, kill, civil war, now's the time.
[00:27:26.465 --> 00:27:27.926]  Huffington Post, you name it.
[00:27:27.926 --> 00:27:30.087]  So many of these articles, I can't even keep track of them.
[00:27:30.087 --> 00:27:31.788]  They're on Infowars.com.
[00:27:31.788 --> 00:27:33.469]  Hashtag hunt Republicans.
[00:27:33.469 --> 00:27:37.352]  Dem strategist calls for civil war.
[00:27:37.352 --> 00:27:38.473]  They're the violent.
[00:27:38.473 --> 00:27:39.794]  They're the hateful.
[00:27:39.794 --> 00:27:49.300]  I mean, think of the arrogance for three years going out to Black Lives Matter events with a bunch of Soros-financed white college folks getting off the buses.
[00:27:50.287 --> 00:27:58.429]  And going around saying, you know, deck the halls with dead cops, kill cops, kill cops, and the cops just sit there while someone says, kill cops, kill cops.
[00:27:58.429 --> 00:28:00.550]  That's not free speech, that's a call to action.
[00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:08.832]  And now they got communists with machine guns walking around, you know, with semi-automatic, threatening to kill people in Austin, and nothing's done.
[00:28:08.832 --> 00:28:13.613]  They're sitting there talking about killing people with their finger on the trigger, but they want law-abiding citizens' guns.
[00:28:16.304 --> 00:28:25.290]  I am amazed by the restraint of conservatives and patriots and Christians and of Hollywood everywhere trying to sexualize children.
[00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:29.313]  Trying to push a war.
[00:28:29.313 --> 00:28:37.138]  And then they roll out some mercenary like Megyn Kelly.
[00:28:37.138 --> 00:28:43.682]  When she wears her establishment crown like it's a crown and really it's like a bag of rotting meat hung over her.
[00:28:47.910 --> 00:28:49.671]  These people are a joke.
[00:28:49.671 --> 00:28:51.231]  Their whole system's going out.
[00:28:51.231 --> 00:28:52.572]  A whole new system's coming in.
[00:28:52.572 --> 00:28:55.673]  I want to affect the system so it's a better world.
[00:28:55.673 --> 00:28:59.515]  Prosperity, that's what Trump wants, and that's why the elite's hating.
[00:28:59.515 --> 00:29:11.940]  Almost 30% profits up for Goldman Sachs, and they want Trump out so bad, even though he has rained money on them with the exuberance, and then the positivity, and the outlook, and the jobs.
[00:29:13.018 --> 00:29:14.100]  And what has MSM done?
[00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:20.793]  Tried to push everything they can to kill confidence, and then Lloyd Blankfein has made horrible statements about the president because he wants to be the unelected president.
[00:29:21.607 --> 00:29:23.387]  And he wants to decide who gets the money.
[00:29:23.387 --> 00:29:27.488]  He doesn't want 30% more this year in record profit for Goldman Sachs.
[00:29:27.488 --> 00:29:41.792]  He wants to say he almost has no profit, write it all off in offshore corporations, and make sure you're bankrupt so he can buy everything up and make you live in a 200-foot, square-foot coffin apartment, because Lloyd Blankfein likes watching you squirm.
[00:29:41.792 --> 00:29:42.992]  He gets off on it.
[00:29:42.992 --> 00:29:44.252]  He's a scumbag.
[00:29:44.252 --> 00:29:45.633]  He hates America.
[00:29:45.633 --> 00:29:46.853]  He hates Donald Trump.
[00:29:46.853 --> 00:29:48.373]  And he hates me.
[00:29:48.373 --> 00:29:49.214]  Well, guess what?
[00:29:49.214 --> 00:29:49.874]  You want to fight?
[00:29:49.874 --> 00:29:50.414]  You got one.
[00:29:51.448 --> 00:29:52.649]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.649 --> 00:29:53.970]  The interview's coming up.
[00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:56.031]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:56.031 --> 00:29:58.172]  You're going to hear her promising it wasn't a hit piece.
[00:29:58.172 --> 00:30:01.134]  You're going to hear her lies.
[00:30:01.134 --> 00:30:10.120]  Following the liberal outcry over Megyn Kelly interviewing Alex Jones, NBC News executives have been scrambling to further edit their hit piece on Alex Jones.
[00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:20.187]  The word now is that Megyn Kelly has changed her Sunday night show featuring Alex Jones' interview by inviting Sandy Hook families on to play edited clips of Alex talking while they have
[00:30:20.247 --> 00:30:22.449]  The parents emotionally respond.
[00:30:22.449 --> 00:30:34.357]  One thing is for sure, with how long it's taking NBC to edit Megyn Kelly's interview with Alex Jones prior to just airing it, we can expect that they will be misrepresenting his statements with skilled editing techniques.
[00:30:34.357 --> 00:30:39.521]  Why not just release the entire interview unedited and prove you're not fake news, NBC?
[00:30:39.521 --> 00:30:48.367]  They'd like you to believe that Alex Jones, not Adam Lanza, is the real bad guy in the Sandy Hook massacre because he said he believes there was a government conspiracy at work.
[00:30:48.567 --> 00:30:58.451]  However, all of this will backfire on the mainstream media, as everyday Americans are increasingly becoming more aware of the staging, faking, and lying that is the mainstream media.
[00:30:58.451 --> 00:31:00.831]  For more reports, go to InfoWars.com.
[00:31:00.831 --> 00:31:02.732]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[00:31:02.732 --> 00:31:04.753]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[00:31:04.753 --> 00:31:07.674]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[00:31:07.674 --> 00:31:10.215]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals,
[00:31:10.555 --> 00:31:13.716]  is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[00:31:13.716 --> 00:31:22.898]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[00:31:22.898 --> 00:31:30.439]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children to do the best job you can to purify your air.
[00:31:30.439 --> 00:31:38.461]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[00:31:38.461 --> 00:31:39.401]  The general public doesn't.
[00:31:40.644 --> 00:31:44.586]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[00:31:44.586 --> 00:31:48.149]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[00:31:48.149 --> 00:31:54.872]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[00:31:54.872 --> 00:31:58.955]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at m4warstore.com.
[00:32:01.033 --> 00:32:07.537]  More than two years ago, InfoWars first told you about our research into what has been called the Iodine Conspiracy.
[00:32:07.537 --> 00:32:20.304]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ, and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[00:32:20.504 --> 00:32:24.165]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[00:32:24.165 --> 00:32:31.148]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[00:32:31.148 --> 00:32:44.013]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[00:32:44.013 --> 00:32:45.574]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[00:32:45.854 --> 00:32:52.243]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.
[00:32:52.243 --> 00:32:57.190]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at Infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[00:33:22.253 --> 00:33:26.454]  From the Front Lines.
[00:33:26.454 --> 00:33:46.399]  From the Front Lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:46.399 --> 00:33:50.280]  Why we stand here idle, my friends, when the war has already begun?
[00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:57.803]  I know not which course others may take, but as for me, give me liberty or give me death.
[00:33:57.803 --> 00:34:02.245]  Hey, if you don't want to join us in this fight, as Patrick Henry said, that's fine.
[00:34:02.245 --> 00:34:11.811]  May your chains set lightly upon you, and may you forget that we were your brethren.
[00:34:11.811 --> 00:34:19.375]  That's what you do when you turn your back on your heritage, your republic, your greatness, your birthright.
[00:34:19.375 --> 00:34:20.776]  You forget who your brethren are.
[00:34:23.117 --> 00:34:26.038]  You give away the greatest thing you've ever had.
[00:34:26.038 --> 00:34:42.003]  Your lineage and what your ancestors did from every corner of the world to try to live a better life and now to have a bunch of monsters like Lloyd Blankfein using weaponized media to try to destroy our president and destroy our recovery and the reboot of America.
[00:34:42.003 --> 00:34:49.206]  Now I'm going to air about 20 minutes of the 27 minute behind the scenes with Megyn Kelly and then we do have the big bulk of the interview.
[00:34:49.206 --> 00:34:50.046]  She interviewed me here,
[00:34:51.448 --> 00:34:56.632]  In the studio, off and on for several hours, and then also at a barbecue place.
[00:34:56.632 --> 00:35:12.744]  But that was all just to lull me into a false sense of security, get me out at some hot box, you know, house in the hill country at 9 o'clock at night, start shooting, end at about 1045.
[00:35:12.744 --> 00:35:13.645]  Well, we got that interview.
[00:35:14.591 --> 00:35:17.732]  And NBC's running around saying, we don't know if we're going to sue Jones.
[00:35:17.732 --> 00:35:20.413]  Well, you know, let me explain something to you how this works.
[00:35:20.413 --> 00:35:21.793]  I'm not a very litigious person.
[00:35:21.793 --> 00:35:26.455]  I didn't need to call my lawyers before I did this.
[00:35:26.455 --> 00:35:29.356]  But I already see the legal experts out there agreeing with me because I'm in the media.
[00:35:29.356 --> 00:35:30.676]  I've studied this.
[00:35:30.676 --> 00:35:32.777]  Texas is a one party consent state.
[00:35:32.777 --> 00:35:36.118]  The state she was in at the time was a one party consent state.
[00:35:36.118 --> 00:35:41.879]  And she was making warranties to me that this was a profile and not a hit piece.
[00:35:41.879 --> 00:35:43.460]  And I knew she was in bed with a Sandy Hook.
[00:35:44.895 --> 00:35:51.718]  Bloomberg anti-gun PR machine that he's admittedly put over a hundred million dollars just into that alone.
[00:35:51.718 --> 00:35:58.480]  Using the families, poor folks, really heart goes out to them that understand what they're in the middle of.
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:04.322]  They're being used as a weapon to try to destroy the Second Amendment so they can always bring it back, bring it back, bring it back.
[00:36:04.322 --> 00:36:11.845]  They're being used by Bloomberg and, you know, dark crystal Skeksis like Megyn Kelly.
[00:36:14.048 --> 00:36:16.850]  And I'm sad for him.
[00:36:16.850 --> 00:36:24.554]  And I'm sad that the government lied about babies being murdered in incubators and to bring us to war to kill millions of people, total, with sanctions that the Democrats accelerated.
[00:36:24.554 --> 00:36:28.056]  And that they say it's a great thing, 500,000 kids, just in a few years of sanctions.
[00:36:28.056 --> 00:36:30.898]  Madeleine Albright said it's a good thing.
[00:36:30.898 --> 00:36:32.099]  That's real news.
[00:36:32.099 --> 00:36:33.519]  That's real murder.
[00:36:33.519 --> 00:36:37.922]  Not Tom Brokaw saying, I'm a quote, unalloyed racist.
[00:36:37.922 --> 00:36:39.483]  That means total.
[00:36:39.483 --> 00:36:41.824]  That means complete in Webster's dictionary.
[00:36:41.824 --> 00:36:42.965]  Can we pull up unalloyed?
[00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:46.262]  I'm going from memory.
[00:36:46.262 --> 00:36:49.164]  I believe it means total, or absolute.
[00:36:49.164 --> 00:36:51.466]  Oh, it means pure.
[00:36:51.466 --> 00:36:52.267]  Same thing.
[00:36:52.267 --> 00:36:56.531]  I am a pure racist.
[00:36:56.531 --> 00:36:57.472]  Pure.
[00:36:57.472 --> 00:36:59.514]  Complete and unreserved.
[00:36:59.514 --> 00:37:02.777]  That's why they have no clips of me saying anything racist.
[00:37:02.777 --> 00:37:05.519]  Imagine the level of fake news of a Tom Brokaw.
[00:37:14.053 --> 00:37:17.617]  Go on NBC.
[00:37:17.617 --> 00:37:21.120]  I mean, this guy was around when the Hindenburg went down.
[00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:26.066]  And to blurp out, I'm a pure racist.
[00:37:26.066 --> 00:37:28.008]  I mean, talk about fake news.
[00:37:28.008 --> 00:37:29.990]  Hey, bro, show the clip.
[00:37:31.664 --> 00:37:32.765]  They just do it.
[00:37:32.765 --> 00:37:34.285]  Oh, you don't like Obamacare, you're a racist.
[00:37:34.285 --> 00:37:36.947]  Oh, you don't like Hillary, you're a racist.
[00:37:36.947 --> 00:37:37.807]  You hate women.
[00:37:37.807 --> 00:37:41.809]  I mean, these people are just throwing everything they've got.
[00:37:41.809 --> 00:37:48.753]  And now, I've seen headlines, Jones, this morning, murdered children.
[00:37:52.910 --> 00:37:55.653]  That was a headline I saw a minute, I need to read later.
[00:37:55.653 --> 00:37:58.335]  The sub-headline would be, Murdered Children Denier.
[00:37:58.335 --> 00:38:02.639]  But no, no, I see, I murdered the children, did you know that?
[00:38:02.639 --> 00:38:09.987]  Well, I don't know why they're saying NBC shouldn't air it, I mean, we interview other people like Jones, you know, child molesters, murderers, dictators.
[00:38:12.952 --> 00:38:16.434]  Oh, he's so evil though, we can't show you what he's saying.
[00:38:16.434 --> 00:38:22.017]  We're just going to tell you that he went and harassed the families of the dead children.
[00:38:22.017 --> 00:38:22.977]  And he hates the children.
[00:38:22.977 --> 00:38:28.520]  Just lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, more lies.
[00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:32.702]  Jones says the firefighters and police blew up the World Trade Center.
[00:38:32.702 --> 00:38:34.863]  Really, where's the clip of that?
[00:38:34.863 --> 00:38:37.945]  Just like Colbert played this clip with a little bitty TV behind him.
[00:38:39.332 --> 00:38:47.478]  So that you couldn't see it was edited, where it had me saying, I'm against gay people.
[00:38:47.478 --> 00:38:49.099]  No, I said I'm not against gay people.
[00:38:49.099 --> 00:39:02.749]  I mean, but they've already been caught lying, so all they do is triple down with more lies, and then Rachel Maddow and people saying, Jones is deeply racist, MSNBC is the talking point, because he doesn't like Obamacare.
[00:39:02.749 --> 00:39:05.811]  See, not liking Obamacare is deeply racist.
[00:39:05.811 --> 00:39:06.272]  Deeply!
[00:39:07.153 --> 00:39:07.933]  Deeply!
[00:39:07.933 --> 00:39:10.034]  But I've gone from deeply to pure.
[00:39:10.034 --> 00:39:15.937]  I guess they haven't checked with the Nazi sites and the New Black Panther sites.
[00:39:15.937 --> 00:39:19.258]  I mean, it seems like every racist organization hates my guts.
[00:39:19.258 --> 00:39:24.220]  Because I want to unify people around Americana, around free market, around prosperity.
[00:39:25.805 --> 00:39:30.430]  I don't feel good when I see poor white people or poor black people or anybody else.
[00:39:30.430 --> 00:39:31.751]  It makes me feel small.
[00:39:31.751 --> 00:39:32.812]  I want prosperity.
[00:39:32.812 --> 00:39:34.013]  I'm a classical liberal.
[00:39:34.013 --> 00:39:35.254]  I like Thomas Jefferson.
[00:39:35.254 --> 00:39:36.556]  I've actually read the writings.
[00:39:36.556 --> 00:39:38.057]  I've actually read his work.
[00:39:38.057 --> 00:39:39.278]  I actually like him.
[00:39:39.278 --> 00:39:39.939]  I admire him.
[00:39:39.939 --> 00:39:41.000]  I believe in him.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.263]  I believe I'm carrying on part of that great shared destiny.
[00:39:44.263 --> 00:39:46.025]  And I want you to join me in that destiny.
[00:39:46.025 --> 00:39:47.006]  I'm going to go to the Megyn Kelly.
[00:39:48.683 --> 00:39:52.324]  Prelude, the hors d'oeuvre, the intro.
[00:39:52.324 --> 00:39:54.465]  And then when they release their piece, we'll see what they did.
[00:39:54.465 --> 00:39:55.786]  I mean, I know what she did.
[00:39:55.786 --> 00:39:58.246]  She'd just stop and then do zingers like I'd just been caught.
[00:39:58.246 --> 00:40:02.088]  Like, you're blaming the people at Pulse nightclub?
[00:40:02.088 --> 00:40:03.908]  You say gays deserve to die?
[00:40:03.908 --> 00:40:06.769]  And I'd be like, I didn't say that.
[00:40:06.769 --> 00:40:13.052]  I said, why do liberals say bring in radical Muslims when they kill gay people in every Muslim country?
[00:40:13.052 --> 00:40:13.792]  It's a death sentence.
[00:40:15.137 --> 00:40:17.698]  I'm saying, I don't want to kill them.
[00:40:17.698 --> 00:40:18.978]  See, that's how they do this.
[00:40:18.978 --> 00:40:23.700]  But she'll just say, you say the kids deserve to die at Manchester.
[00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:25.061]  I never said that, lady.
[00:40:25.061 --> 00:40:26.781]  I said, why'd the left bring in these Muslims?
[00:40:26.781 --> 00:40:29.722]  You know, they've had three high-rises now burned down the last three days.
[00:40:29.722 --> 00:40:31.283]  It's Ramadan.
[00:40:31.283 --> 00:40:32.063]  It's firebombs.
[00:40:32.063 --> 00:40:33.464]  The Muslims are celebrating it.
[00:40:33.464 --> 00:40:35.585]  But the media won't even tell you that.
[00:40:35.585 --> 00:40:38.746]  Scotland Yard knows it's starting to come out now.
[00:40:38.746 --> 00:40:44.288]  The Muslims are burning down high-rises and even burning down high-rises full of Muslims because they don't care.
[00:40:47.435 --> 00:40:51.780]  The polls in Europe are between 25 and 40 percent depending on the poll.
[00:40:51.780 --> 00:41:00.889]  Tell pollsters at their doors they want to jihad and support suicide bombers.
[00:41:00.889 --> 00:41:06.515]  And now England has imported people that are running around burning everything down.
[00:41:06.515 --> 00:41:08.938]  Now show the skyscraper that burned three days ago.
[00:41:11.747 --> 00:41:14.288]  Notice it didn't collapse, like Building 7.
[00:41:14.288 --> 00:41:17.089]  So let me get to this piece, but just briefly.
[00:41:17.089 --> 00:41:23.410]  If you are not financially supporting InfoWars, getting great products you already need, you're insane.
[00:41:23.410 --> 00:41:26.731]  I know only a fraction of our listeners, and God love them, buy the products.
[00:41:26.731 --> 00:41:28.712]  I mean, X2, the good halogen, changed my life.
[00:41:29.884 --> 00:41:34.727]  Most people can't absorb iodine or it's a bound type that's tied in or comes from seaweed.
[00:41:34.727 --> 00:41:35.908]  This is from deep-breath crystals.
[00:41:35.908 --> 00:41:37.209]  It's pure.
[00:41:37.209 --> 00:41:38.170]  It's in palm oil.
[00:41:38.170 --> 00:41:39.651]  It changed my life.
[00:41:39.651 --> 00:41:46.555]  I did detox about three weeks into it though and you should consult your medical provider before you take it because it's serious.
[00:41:46.555 --> 00:41:47.936]  4.9 stars from Power Reviews.
[00:41:47.936 --> 00:41:48.777]  Nobody's got that.
[00:41:48.777 --> 00:41:49.658]  4,000 plus reviews.
[00:41:54.269 --> 00:42:04.833]  Available, it's discounted right now, even though it's about to sell out yet again, and we are having more and more trouble actually procuring the Deep Earth Pistol Source, but I believe we're going to be able to get more of it, but the group is running down on this.
[00:42:04.833 --> 00:42:13.516]  And it was folks trying to shut off our supply of some of the cleanest seaweed based stuff a few years ago that ended up letting us get in touch with the oil companies that run into this very rarely.
[00:42:14.879 --> 00:42:15.719]  That's a specialty.
[00:42:15.719 --> 00:42:21.721]  You've got to pay them a lot to be able to even extract it when they go through it because they're going to the gas and oil that's deeper generally.
[00:42:21.721 --> 00:42:25.763]  This comes from between 7 and 12,000 feet deep drilling.
[00:42:25.763 --> 00:42:28.044]  And it comes out pure crystals and they're so explosive.
[00:42:28.044 --> 00:42:29.124]  It's like alien blood.
[00:42:29.124 --> 00:42:33.866]  It eats through concrete that it has to be kept in special DEA certified facilities.
[00:42:33.866 --> 00:42:42.969]  Then with proprietary Russian technology, oh my gosh we're Russian agents now, it's then injected in a gas into the palm oil
[00:42:44.033 --> 00:42:44.453]  We're good to go.
[00:43:06.957 --> 00:43:09.159]  In the next week, that is a big deal.
[00:43:09.159 --> 00:43:11.480]  You sign up for auto-ship, additional 10% off.

[00:43:15.643 --> 00:43:25.710]  But whether it's Biotrus Selenium, or whether it's our nanotechnology body armor, developed right here in Texas, first available to Infowarriors that military and law enforcement use, it's all there.
[00:43:25.710 --> 00:43:28.112]  Infowars biome defense, high quality probiotic.
[00:43:29.042 --> 00:43:31.623]  That's available in fullwarrestore.com and fullwarrelife.com.
[00:43:31.623 --> 00:43:38.887]  Again, we have a biome defense with the 50 billion live active strains in it.
[00:43:38.887 --> 00:43:39.768]  Amazing.
[00:43:39.768 --> 00:43:41.749]  Repopulate your gut with the good bacteria.
[00:43:41.749 --> 00:43:45.811]  Get 25% off right now on BioTrue Selenium with X-Tube.

[00:43:52.855 --> 00:43:55.096]  Got tea tree oil and more.
[00:43:57.116 --> 00:44:01.600]  Again, as I mentioned, Survival Shield X2 and Biotrin Selenium 25% off together.
[00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:02.641]  Take advantage today.
[00:44:02.641 --> 00:44:06.544]  Liver Shield's about to sell out, so I was asking the crew, why is it 20% off?
[00:44:06.544 --> 00:44:07.344]  Well, whatever.
[00:44:07.344 --> 00:44:08.665]  We're going to keep it there until it sells out.
[00:44:08.665 --> 00:44:13.730]  It takes sometimes six months to get Liver Shield, a great known concentrated herbs to detoxify the body.
[00:44:13.730 --> 00:44:14.290]  That's available.
[00:44:14.290 --> 00:44:18.854]  You can get it discounted with the Oxy Powder as well and flush out your upper and lower intestines.
[00:44:18.854 --> 00:44:19.855]  It's dramatic.
[00:44:20.575 --> 00:44:22.597]  You can read about the gallbladder cleanses as well.
[00:44:22.597 --> 00:44:27.101]  Instructional videos on InfoWars.com, InfoWarsLive.com, BrainForce+.
[00:44:27.101 --> 00:44:28.843]  Now 20% more is back in stock as well.
[00:44:28.843 --> 00:44:30.645]  I don't know about the nootropic.
[00:44:33.544 --> 00:44:41.130]  We've also introduced a new line, the first of six from Emmerich's Essentials, a national brand, one of the top three in the country at Whole Foods.
[00:44:41.130 --> 00:44:44.293]  The owner is a patron, he lets us private label it with the same packaging even.
[00:44:44.293 --> 00:44:54.681]  We just changed the name to Emmerich's Essentials, 20% off retail on average, 25% off on auto ship on that because I want to introduce you to that, but I'm going to end that 25% off on auto ship because we really don't even make any money at that price.
[00:44:54.681 --> 00:44:59.825]  I mean, this is shampoo, it's like, you know, $18 at Whole Foods and we're selling it for
[00:45:00.846 --> 00:45:02.888]  12 dollars and you get the discount, it's like 9 dollars.
[00:45:02.888 --> 00:45:05.329]  You just can't beat that.
[00:45:05.329 --> 00:45:09.232]  The deodorant, everybody says, I recognize that label, that's like the top deodorant in the country.
[00:45:09.232 --> 00:45:16.197]  Yeah, I mean the deodorant is arguably the top national brand of organic, aluminum free, metal free.
[00:45:19.099 --> 00:45:27.782]  So, that item right there has whole end caps at stores and it is discounted at infowarestore.com under my middle name, Emmerich's Essentials.
[00:45:27.782 --> 00:45:28.582]  So take advantage of that.
[00:45:28.582 --> 00:45:30.162]  But I am ending it next week.
[00:45:30.162 --> 00:45:32.043]  I'm going to end the 25% off and go to 10% off.
[00:45:32.043 --> 00:45:34.424]  So take advantage of Emmerich's Essentials.
[00:45:34.424 --> 00:45:42.326]  I wanted to give our most diehard fans and listeners that fund this operation that are the InfoWar the first shot at getting 25% off.
[00:45:42.326 --> 00:45:43.927]  You can cancel any time on auto show.
[00:45:45.643 --> 00:45:48.885]  I'm going to skip this network break with only one today because the network needs to run its ads.
[00:45:48.885 --> 00:45:49.946]  I understand that.
[00:45:49.946 --> 00:45:51.587]  Good old folks at GCN.
[00:45:51.587 --> 00:45:52.688]  I love them.
[00:45:52.688 --> 00:45:56.511]  And then we are going to come back and have some special guests today as well.
[00:45:56.511 --> 00:46:03.156]  And then, you know, I think I may air some of the Megyn Kelly interview.
[00:46:03.156 --> 00:46:03.937]  I've been thinking about it.
[00:46:03.937 --> 00:46:05.998]  I just go with my instinct.
[00:46:05.998 --> 00:46:09.441]  I'm thinking about airing some of it because I know the parts they're going to really manipulate.
[00:46:10.452 --> 00:46:15.599]  Because again, she'd asked me about Sandy Hook five times, Pizzagate five times, Shabani five, six times.
[00:46:15.599 --> 00:46:21.207]  Again, I don't even want to say what she was saying to me, because they'll take that out of context and say I said it.
[00:46:21.207 --> 00:46:22.228]  They're so deceptive.
[00:46:22.228 --> 00:46:24.110]  They hate this country so much, in my view.
[00:46:25.162 --> 00:46:32.708]  I don't know if she does personally, but she works for people that do, that are just squatting on us, preying on us, raping our consciousness, raping our psyche.
[00:46:32.708 --> 00:46:38.453]  I mean, it's just, I have a stack of news, top Democrats saying, start murdering everyone.
[00:46:38.453 --> 00:46:45.919]  I mean, they're so crazy, they're so power crazed, that they think they're about to win a physical civil war with us.
[00:46:45.919 --> 00:46:48.901]  I mean, they are just monsters.
[00:46:48.901 --> 00:46:50.082]  And I'm so sick of the bullying.
[00:46:54.181 --> 00:46:56.822]  I just think about all the children they abort.
[00:46:56.822 --> 00:46:59.983]  I think about all the third world people they starve to death while claiming they love them.
[00:46:59.983 --> 00:47:04.485]  I think about their carbon tax that would kill a billion people according to Lord Monckton's analysis over a decade.
[00:47:04.485 --> 00:47:10.727]  I just think about what dirtbags they are and the things they do and the class warfare like this particular Democrat saying go out and kill Republicans.
[00:47:11.667 --> 00:47:13.368]  It's on Infowars.com.
[00:47:13.368 --> 00:47:15.910]  He says because they're a bunch of greedy rich people.
[00:47:15.910 --> 00:47:25.358]  Did you know that the last time I checked the wealth of Democrats in Congress over Republicans is something like 10 to 1?
[00:47:25.358 --> 00:47:28.600]  The most rich people in the world.
[00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:33.184]  There's only a few billionaires like Donald Trump and Peter Thiel that are libertarians or independent.
[00:47:34.206 --> 00:47:42.813]  They're almost all either fence-sitters that fund both sides, the Koch brothers do that, and of course another brother's a big liberal, so you balance that out.
[00:47:42.813 --> 00:47:47.717]  They've given more money the last 30 years to Democrats than Republicans.
[00:47:47.717 --> 00:47:48.898]  And they back the Clintons.
[00:47:48.898 --> 00:47:53.322]  The point is, you can count Republican millionaires on two hands.
[00:47:53.322 --> 00:47:55.144]  There's hundreds and hundreds of Democrat ones.
[00:47:57.353 --> 00:48:03.835]  And they're all tax-exempt offshore because they're using class warfare to divert how they're creating monopolistic systems.
[00:48:03.835 --> 00:48:10.196]  So here's part of the behind-the-scenes, Megyn Kelly, and then the full video and audio is on Infowars.com.
[00:48:10.196 --> 00:48:16.277]  It's a number two on Google, number two on Twitter, number two on Facebook.
[00:48:16.277 --> 00:48:17.958]  About an hour ago when I checked, what's number one?
[00:48:17.958 --> 00:48:19.018]  What's the number one thing on the web today?
[00:48:20.524 --> 00:48:23.025]  But I mean, just our videos, number two.
[00:48:23.025 --> 00:48:26.786]  Overall, the Alex Jones, Megyn Kelly story for a week now is the biggest story.
[00:48:26.786 --> 00:48:29.087]  Bigger than the criminal investigation of Trump.
[00:48:29.087 --> 00:48:29.787]  Bigger than whatever.
[00:48:29.787 --> 00:48:30.027]  Why?
[00:48:30.027 --> 00:48:34.548]  Because they made it big trying to destroy you.
[00:48:34.548 --> 00:48:36.509]  Trying to shut down your free speech.
[00:48:36.509 --> 00:48:39.189]  Trying to dominate and control.
[00:48:39.189 --> 00:48:47.772]  Trying to set the precedent and prepare InfoWars to be sued for its free speech into oblivion.
[00:48:50.731 --> 00:48:53.715]  That's all the preparation that's going to set up that new standard.
[00:48:53.715 --> 00:49:03.388]  Because we have that from inside the law firms, where the Democrats are planning this, because some people in the law firms are not pure evil, and they love America, and they realize, wow, this is really dastardly.
[00:49:03.388 --> 00:49:05.872]  So see, we know pretty much everything that's going on.
[00:49:07.039 --> 00:49:11.300]  But without even talking to the moles, I already know what you're up to.
[00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:11.680]  Okay?
[00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:14.221]  And God's gonna protect me or allow me to be destroyed.
[00:49:14.221 --> 00:49:15.181]  That doesn't matter.
[00:49:15.181 --> 00:49:16.902]  You're gonna go down in the process.
[00:49:16.902 --> 00:49:18.762]  It's called a Pyrrhic victory.
[00:49:18.762 --> 00:49:22.043]  I'm not a sociopath, psychopath like you, Globalist.
[00:49:22.043 --> 00:49:23.644]  I want victory for my family.
[00:49:23.644 --> 00:49:25.904]  I want a future for your family together.
[00:49:25.904 --> 00:49:29.005]  I'm here to lay it on the line because it's an honor.
[00:49:29.005 --> 00:49:30.546]  It's what a man's supposed to do.
[00:49:30.546 --> 00:49:31.366]  I'm not a hero.
[00:49:31.366 --> 00:49:33.627]  This is what I'm supposed to do.
[00:49:33.627 --> 00:49:34.347]  This is my
[00:49:36.175 --> 00:49:36.695]  Destiny.
[00:49:36.695 --> 00:49:38.176]  It's your destiny if you choose as well.
[00:49:38.176 --> 00:49:39.857]  This is what I was born for.
[00:49:39.857 --> 00:49:41.398]  This is the process.
[00:49:41.398 --> 00:49:44.180]  This is good versus evil.
[00:49:44.180 --> 00:49:45.081]  I want to be tested.
[00:49:45.081 --> 00:49:46.281]  I want to go through the fire.
[00:49:46.281 --> 00:49:47.042]  I don't like pain.
[00:49:47.042 --> 00:49:47.802]  I don't like attacks.
[00:49:47.802 --> 00:49:52.505]  It's not fun to have people look at me and spit at me and hate me on the street.
[00:49:52.505 --> 00:49:54.247]  But they're the minority of idiots.
[00:49:54.247 --> 00:49:58.930]  The people with glowing eyes that are alive and awake are so humbling of every
[00:50:00.020 --> 00:50:07.426]  Color and every shape and every size, but with the soul, with God's light shining through them, that's what matters.
[00:50:07.426 --> 00:50:08.967]  I'm so humbled by our viewers and listeners.
[00:50:08.967 --> 00:50:12.450]  And when I run into you, it's just, you're so good.
[00:50:12.450 --> 00:50:15.332]  And I am so honored to even be associated with you.
[00:50:15.332 --> 00:50:17.494]  So don't thank me.
[00:50:17.494 --> 00:50:19.996]  I love you.
[00:50:19.996 --> 00:50:23.459]  And I'm going to stumble and I'm weak, but I, my heart's right.
[00:50:23.459 --> 00:50:24.500]  And I love you.
[00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:25.200]  God loves you.
[00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:26.381]  And we love each other.
[00:50:26.381 --> 00:50:26.882]  We're going to win.
[00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:32.325]  We may not individually win, but together, the species and God's plan will win.
[00:50:32.325 --> 00:50:34.227]  Now here's some excerpts of the first third of it.
[00:50:34.227 --> 00:50:36.029]  I'll air more in the next hour as well.
[00:50:36.029 --> 00:50:37.610]  But the full thing's on Infowars.com.
[00:50:37.610 --> 00:50:38.071]  Here it is.
[00:50:38.071 --> 00:50:39.252]  Rob did a great job.
[00:50:39.252 --> 00:50:44.558]  This is a phone call about a week and a half before Megyn Kelly got here where she's lying through her teeth.
[00:50:44.558 --> 00:50:48.202]  All I can do is give you my word and tell you if there's one thing about me, I do what I say.
[00:50:50.916 --> 00:50:53.717]  You know, you just became very fascinating to me.
[00:50:53.717 --> 00:50:57.919]  I just sort of thought you were this maybe, you know, one-dimensional guy.
[00:50:57.919 --> 00:50:59.060]  Like, this is your thing.
[00:50:59.060 --> 00:51:07.985]  My goal is for your listeners and the left, you know, who will be watching some on NBC to say, wow, that was really interesting.
[00:51:07.985 --> 00:51:12.387]  And then the next time I want to get somebody, they're going to say, look what you did to Alex Jones.
[00:51:12.387 --> 00:51:14.308]  It's not going to be some gotcha hit piece.
[00:51:14.308 --> 00:51:15.209]  I promise you that.
[00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:23.841]  We talked controversies and conspiracies.
[00:51:23.841 --> 00:51:24.961]  9-11.
[00:51:24.961 --> 00:51:26.842]  Now, 9-11 was an inside job.
[00:51:26.842 --> 00:51:32.543]  When I say inside job, it means criminal elements in our government working with Saudi Arabia and others wanted to frame Iraq for it.
[00:51:32.543 --> 00:51:34.484]  Just a fact.
[00:51:34.484 --> 00:51:43.326]  You are about to view and listen to information that's never before been seen or heard.
[00:51:47.202 --> 00:51:53.084]  In the past, MSM, corporate media, could tell the truth, they could lie, they could spin.
[00:51:53.084 --> 00:51:54.244]  It was up to them.
[00:51:54.244 --> 00:51:56.724]  They were the gods of information.
[00:51:56.724 --> 00:52:13.869]  But Megyn Kelly waltzed in here to Austin, Texas, and told me that she wasn't going to talk about Sandy Hook, she wasn't going to talk about Pete Segue, she wasn't going to talk about Shabani, she wasn't going to talk about Islamic terror attacks, that she wanted to do a softball profile of Alex Jones.
[00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:25.256]  And when she got here with her crew of intelligence operatives, she did the opposite of what she said.
[00:52:25.256 --> 00:52:27.898]  And so I was recording the whole time.
[00:52:27.898 --> 00:52:38.905]  From our pre-interviews, right through the interviews, we have a record of it so that you can decide for yourself what I really said and what I stood for.
[00:52:38.905 --> 00:52:43.768]  These tyrants haven't figured it out yet that information warfare is a two-way street.
[00:52:45.566 --> 00:52:48.910]  And we're going to give as good as we get.
[00:52:48.910 --> 00:52:50.291]  And that's what you're about to see.
[00:52:50.291 --> 00:52:53.615]  You alone will be the judge.
[00:52:53.615 --> 00:53:02.244]  You alone will be the jury of who's fake news, and who stands for America, and who stands against it.
[00:53:02.244 --> 00:53:04.927]  I'm Alex Jones, and this is the Infowar.
[00:53:06.516 --> 00:53:10.057]  Well, so I started my new job, you may have heard.
[00:53:10.057 --> 00:53:17.079]  And we're going to start first with this Sunday night in a news magazine program across for 60 minutes.
[00:53:17.079 --> 00:53:22.560]  And it's a good, it's sort of a good opportunity for long form storytelling.
[00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:25.101]  You know, it's like, it's not like the three minute interview.
[00:53:25.101 --> 00:53:28.181]  It's like the in depth profiles of people.
[00:53:28.181 --> 00:53:31.542]  And at the top of my list was you.
[00:53:31.542 --> 00:53:33.783]  So it's like an investigative report into fake news?
[00:53:35.545 --> 00:53:36.668]  No, no.
[00:53:36.668 --> 00:53:38.775]  What we're doing?
[00:53:38.775 --> 00:53:39.477]  Yeah, come on.
[00:53:40.649 --> 00:53:41.209]  No, no, no.
[00:53:41.209 --> 00:53:42.150]  Hell no.
[00:53:42.150 --> 00:53:46.451]  The reason you... I mean, I know you've got, you know, what you do.
[00:53:46.451 --> 00:53:52.653]  But the reason you are interesting to me is because I followed your custody case.
[00:53:52.653 --> 00:53:57.415]  And I think you had a very good point about the way the media was covering it.
[00:53:57.415 --> 00:54:06.778]  And for some reason treated you and your family and what was going on as their game when they never would have done that to, you know, if you will, a mainstream media figure.
[00:54:07.558 --> 00:54:11.401]  And I saw a different side of you in that whole thing.
[00:54:11.401 --> 00:54:17.186]  I just, you're, you know, you just became very fascinating to me.
[00:54:17.186 --> 00:54:22.650]  I just sort of thought you were this maybe, you know, one-dimensional guy, like this was your thing.
[00:54:22.650 --> 00:54:29.436]  And the comments I heard from you during the course of that trial, and your plea to the media to be respectful of you and your kids,
[00:54:30.578 --> 00:54:34.900]  Just reminded me that you're just like anybody.
[00:54:34.900 --> 00:54:40.541]  You're a dad, and you go through the same things we go through, and I thought... You know, hit pause real quick.
[00:54:40.541 --> 00:54:42.082]  Back in about 10 seconds.
[00:54:42.082 --> 00:54:44.363]  And when it all dawned on me, they told me it was going to air in July.
[00:54:44.363 --> 00:54:46.283]  You're going to hear that.
[00:54:46.283 --> 00:54:50.525]  And then when I learned they were going to air it on Father's Day, and I saw the PR.
[00:54:51.934 --> 00:54:59.295]  Show up in, let's not exaggerate, 15 newspapers or so that I just saw on the Google feed, the same five minutes.
[00:54:59.295 --> 00:55:06.437]  So they put the talking points out, they had the people kind of write it, put their name on it, act like it was independent, and then boom!
[00:55:06.437 --> 00:55:11.577]  Monday morning, Jones on Father's Day to rub it into the Newtown families.
[00:55:11.577 --> 00:55:13.378]  Did I initiate the interview?
[00:55:13.378 --> 00:55:15.418]  Did I say it was going to air on Father's Day?
[00:55:15.418 --> 00:55:16.418]  Did I dictate that?
[00:55:16.418 --> 00:55:16.838]  No.
[00:55:16.838 --> 00:55:20.399]  I mean, they're staging it all in front of everyone.
[00:55:22.054 --> 00:55:23.955]  It's incredible!
[00:55:23.955 --> 00:55:35.418]  And I've talked to top writers, they say, we've never seen this before, except before the launch of Wars, where they're bringing in outside people at the top that are directing everybody not to quote anything you've actually said.
[00:55:35.418 --> 00:55:40.419]  That's why I had to release the tape, because there's no way they can ignore that.
[00:55:40.419 --> 00:55:43.700]  So we're breaking through their controls, you see.
[00:55:43.700 --> 00:55:46.041]  We're breaking through, that's what they can't stand.
[00:55:46.041 --> 00:55:49.742]  They want a monopoly, they want to test the media, test the MSM,
[00:55:50.899 --> 00:56:00.483]  That's become a utility of criminal elements of the federal government, and that march in lockstep with spree decor!
[00:56:00.483 --> 00:56:04.705]  I mean, it's like those Prussian horses that, you know, march with their feet flying way up in the air.
[00:56:04.705 --> 00:56:08.767]  I mean, it is like watching well-trained horses or something.
[00:56:08.767 --> 00:56:09.628]  This is crazy!
[00:56:10.713 --> 00:56:17.700]  The precision of the lies, the sophistication of these lies gives me headaches to even understand it.
[00:56:17.700 --> 00:56:19.802]  No wonder the public doesn't know what to do.
[00:56:19.802 --> 00:56:21.524]  I mean, it's so crazy.
[00:56:21.524 --> 00:56:32.735]  I have to sit here and really analyze it until I get headaches to see the equations and how they're operating, and then I know what they're going to do next, too, if I just get in a quiet room and really focus, and then I can figure out how to counter them.
[00:56:35.350 --> 00:56:38.932]  To get inside the heads of these executives, they're just America haters, man.
[00:56:38.932 --> 00:57:02.467]  They're so twisted beta-alpha, it's like a beta-alpha thing I want to coin, where it's like we've created this open, free society, and then alphas shaborn that and are loving and good, because we're in a non-wartime situation, and then the betas come in and create new forms of warfare to dominate us, but not for resources or power or a future, but to just, they don't want alphas!
[00:57:02.467 --> 00:57:03.608]  They want to kill us!
[00:57:04.943 --> 00:57:06.505]  They don't want lovers.
[00:57:06.505 --> 00:57:07.466]  They don't want fighters.
[00:57:07.466 --> 00:57:12.293]  They want little creepy scumbags like Mr. Burns.
[00:57:12.293 --> 00:57:13.554]  We're going to go to break and play some more of it.
[00:57:13.554 --> 00:57:16.078]  The full thing is on Infowars.com.
[00:57:16.078 --> 00:57:20.744]  It's just listening to this and realizing the whole deception, the whole thing's been rigged.
[00:57:20.744 --> 00:57:22.166]  The whole thing's been choreographed.
[00:57:23.203 --> 00:57:31.987]  But it isn't going the way they thought because they still narcissistically and psychopathically and sociopathically follow these set programs.
[00:57:31.987 --> 00:57:34.648]  They're very OCD, these predators.
[00:57:34.648 --> 00:57:37.089]  And so they can't believe they're losing.
[00:57:37.089 --> 00:57:45.792]  So they flail and they call for violence and they call for my death and Trump's death and they organize all this crime.
[00:57:45.792 --> 00:57:47.633]  And they get away with it.
[00:57:47.633 --> 00:57:50.414]  Because they are in control of the major central systems.
[00:57:51.766 --> 00:57:57.228]  But it's like watching Nero run around going progressively more insane.
[00:57:57.228 --> 00:58:06.050]  And they look at me and think if they can just destroy me or Donald Trump, you know, we're the twin evils, that they somehow can be back where they were.
[00:58:06.050 --> 00:58:09.031]  You're not where you were 10 years ago or a year ago, sweethearts.
[00:58:10.811 --> 00:58:13.032]  You're like a giant squid that attacks a sperm whale.
[00:58:13.032 --> 00:58:14.673]  The sperm whales always win.
[00:58:14.673 --> 00:58:16.034]  The squid still attack.
[00:58:16.034 --> 00:58:17.795]  They just think they're attacking.
[00:58:17.795 --> 00:58:24.219]  The whale just dives, dives, dives, dives, dives down to a level that the squid can't even go to and just passes out and just eats it.
[00:58:24.219 --> 00:58:26.560]  Goes back up.
[00:58:26.560 --> 00:58:27.681]  Yeah, you may tear my face up.
[00:58:27.681 --> 00:58:28.761]  You might even get one of my eyes.
[00:58:28.761 --> 00:58:29.582]  But you know what?
[00:58:29.582 --> 00:58:31.423]  I'll still smell the ladies.
[00:58:31.423 --> 00:58:32.283]  Don't need you.
[00:58:32.283 --> 00:58:36.266]  When I roll over dead in the sun, the shark's gonna eat my blubber.
[00:58:36.266 --> 00:58:38.227]  But my babies are gonna live on in that ocean.
[00:58:41.218 --> 00:58:44.750]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:44.750 --> 00:58:46.937]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:52.305 --> 00:58:56.066]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:58:56.066 --> 00:59:03.807]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:59:03.807 --> 00:59:12.428]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:59:12.428 --> 00:59:16.829]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:59:16.829 --> 00:59:22.090]  Pathenogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality,
[00:59:22.430 --> 00:59:26.671]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[00:59:26.671 --> 00:59:30.092]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[00:59:30.092 --> 00:59:41.215]  AnthroPlex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[00:59:41.215 --> 00:59:44.116]  Discover why AnthroPlex is turning so many heads today.
[00:59:44.116 --> 00:59:50.098]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at InfoWarsLife.com with AnthroPlex.
[00:59:53.513 --> 01:00:02.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:07.264]  I was listening to this song this morning.
[01:00:07.264 --> 01:00:10.226]  Man Rush is an amazing band.
[01:00:10.226 --> 01:00:12.708]  Get on with the fascination.
[01:00:12.708 --> 01:00:16.971]  Before America can be great again, she must be free.
[01:00:16.971 --> 01:00:18.272]  It's not about the control.
[01:00:18.272 --> 01:00:20.474]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:20.474 --> 01:00:22.015]  It's about the majesty of the mystery.
[01:00:24.155 --> 01:00:29.757]  Let's play a little bit of this song.
[01:00:29.757 --> 01:00:30.898]  Some idiots will say it's Illuminati.
[01:00:30.898 --> 01:00:34.059]  We're talking about illumination.
[01:00:34.059 --> 01:00:37.980]  The enemy claims they're giving illumination.
[01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:40.101]  That's the counterfeit.
[01:00:40.101 --> 01:00:43.622]  The real illumination is here.
[01:00:43.622 --> 01:00:45.763]  God's energy shining through the universe.
[01:00:45.763 --> 01:00:48.004]  The water of life.
[01:00:48.004 --> 01:00:49.385]  Spacetime continuum.
[01:00:49.385 --> 01:00:49.845]  Creation.
[01:00:52.836 --> 01:00:59.880]  Underlying force that will guide us to the future.
[01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:10.346]  And the fall of these evil, wicked people that are so delusional, they believed they would be successful in robbing us of our future.
[01:01:10.346 --> 01:01:13.728]  All right, let's go and play more of the Megyn Kelly interview that I got guests coming up, I'll tell you about in a moment.
[01:01:13.728 --> 01:01:17.811]  But here's more of the behind the scenes of Megyn Kelly committing Shepaku.
[01:01:19.036 --> 01:01:21.518]  I don't know why I accepted this challenge.
[01:01:21.518 --> 01:01:26.181]  It's like some subconscious algorithm that leads me with the assurance of a sleepwalker.
[01:01:51.229 --> 01:02:01.958]  I knew that if I entered the labyrinth of the Gorgon, of this modern-day Medusa, that through the process others would understand the larger deception.
[01:02:01.958 --> 01:02:10.645]  If I didn't take the challenge, then good, or at least an open heart, would be hiding from evil.
[01:02:10.645 --> 01:02:17.311]  And so that's why I let Megyn Kelly set up this conflict on her own.
[01:02:18.985 --> 01:02:20.685]  No, I mean, I can ask you about that.
[01:02:48.050 --> 01:02:54.493]  This is not going to be a contentious, you know, sort of gotcha exchange.
[01:02:54.493 --> 01:02:58.174]  That's not what this show is, and that's really not what I want to do.
[01:02:58.174 --> 01:03:03.036]  I want to do in-depth profiles on people, just interesting people.
[01:03:03.036 --> 01:03:08.319]  So I can ask you to have this with a critic's day, but this isn't going to be a, aha, let's play a clip.
[01:03:09.179 --> 01:03:10.739]  Wow, here's the headlines.
[01:03:10.739 --> 01:03:18.001]  Megyn Kelly defends Alex Jones' interview, responds to backlash, Sandy Hook claim is revolting.
[01:03:18.001 --> 01:03:24.823]  But then she didn't show in her promo video that I said I believe Sandy Hook happened.
[01:03:24.823 --> 01:03:34.165]  And that I had war-gamed the three views that criminal groups went in and killed the kids, or it happened as they officially said, or they used actors.
[01:03:35.458 --> 01:03:48.047]  I mean, we saw in 1990 our Congress being lied to by the daughter of the head of a PR firm about Saddam Hussein's soldiers killing hundreds of babies, bashing their brains out.
[01:03:48.047 --> 01:03:49.729]  It's not that Saddam was a good guy.
[01:03:49.729 --> 01:03:53.351]  It's not that a lot of us were even against the war.
[01:03:53.351 --> 01:04:01.938]  We were lied to with propaganda that they admittedly came out and told us was a fraud later.
[01:04:01.938 --> 01:04:03.579]  They took the babies out of incubators.
[01:04:07.476 --> 01:04:08.537]  Sir, I don't mind.
[01:04:36.818 --> 01:04:38.960]  I don't mind questions.
[01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:53.429]  What I don't like is, did you know, or did your producers do that to you, where I said Hillary Clinton, personally, and it was tongue-in-cheek so I could get the satire out of you guys, took it out of context, but did personally kill kids by the Iraq War, Syria War.
[01:04:53.429 --> 01:04:54.830]  We'll be right back with more, folks.
[01:04:54.830 --> 01:04:55.951]  Stay with us, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:05:01.195 --> 01:05:10.319]  A team of global warming scientists were forced to cancel an Arctic trip due to extreme ice conditions, which highlights how the advocacy against man-made climate change is actually a globalist scheme to weaken the U.S.
[01:05:10.319 --> 01:05:10.739]  economy.
[01:05:10.739 --> 01:05:15.502]  A group of 40 scientists were on board the Amundsen, a research ship known for its ice-breaking capabilities.
[01:05:15.502 --> 01:05:18.663]  But this time, the ice proved too thick for the ship to break through safely.
[01:05:18.863 --> 01:05:22.424]  Right on cue, one of the researchers blamed the ice on man-made climate change.
[01:05:22.424 --> 01:05:31.047]  But notice how it's typically government-funded scientists and politicians who are pushing the climate change agenda, despite the fact that, historically, the biggest polluter in the world is the government.
[01:05:31.047 --> 01:05:36.709]  You see, the globalists harped the dangers of man-made climate change, which they renamed from global warming once the data didn't fit their agenda.
[01:05:36.969 --> 01:05:37.289]  We're good.
[01:06:00.788 --> 01:06:06.189]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue Fluoride Toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:06:06.189 --> 01:06:09.030]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[01:06:09.030 --> 01:06:11.031]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[01:06:11.031 --> 01:06:16.032]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[01:06:16.032 --> 01:06:18.132]  Research across the board is clear.
[01:06:18.132 --> 01:06:19.433]  In fact, it's certified.
[01:06:19.433 --> 01:06:24.534]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[01:06:24.534 --> 01:06:27.895]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants.
[01:06:28.115 --> 01:06:28.395]  I'm good.
[01:06:51.075 --> 01:06:52.496]  Nano, silver and more.

[01:07:10.908 --> 01:07:18.013]  My favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:07:18.013 --> 01:07:22.896]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[01:07:43.872 --> 01:07:48.356]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[01:07:58.044 --> 01:08:00.226]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:08:07.805 --> 01:08:12.708]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[01:08:12.708 --> 01:08:32.298]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:08:32.298 --> 01:08:35.759]  Behind the scenes with Megyn Kelly, the exclusive.
[01:08:35.759 --> 01:08:36.500]  You're part of it now.
[01:08:38.411 --> 01:08:46.499]  I mean, it was in the same 30 seconds where I said I'm not talking about the pizza place, I'm talking about in the Middle East.
[01:08:52.691 --> 01:08:56.573]  Megan, as many controversies do these days, it began with a tweet.
[01:08:56.573 --> 01:09:17.306]  On October 30th, days after the FBI announced they'd be reopening an investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails, someone on Twitter, whose name remains unverified but has several thousand followers, posted that new emails found on Anthony Weiner's computer confirmed that Hillary Clinton was involved in a pedophilia ring.
[01:09:17.846 --> 01:09:24.134]  InfoWars Alex Jones, a far-right web host, posted a YouTube video seen almost 500,000 times.
[01:09:37.285 --> 01:09:48.669]  The rumor spread, inspiring some newfound internet sleuths to start digging around in John Podesta's hacked emails, searching for proof and location of the so-called sex ring.
[01:09:48.669 --> 01:09:51.250]  What they found were numerous references to pizza,
[01:09:55.345 --> 01:09:58.267]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to the sun.
[01:09:58.267 --> 01:09:59.428]  A message to Hillary.
[01:09:59.428 --> 01:10:02.171]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:10:02.171 --> 01:10:15.381]  When I think about all the children Hillary Clinton has personally murdered and chopped up and raped, I have zero fear standing up against her.
[01:10:15.381 --> 01:10:16.582]  Yeah, you heard me right.
[01:10:16.582 --> 01:10:17.283]  Hillary Clinton has
[01:10:17.543 --> 01:10:19.405]  Personally murdered children.
[01:10:19.405 --> 01:10:25.471]  I just can't hold back the truth anymore.
[01:10:25.471 --> 01:10:29.676]  Hillary Clinton is one of the most vicious serial killers the planet's ever seen.
[01:10:29.676 --> 01:10:32.899]  Now there's a twist to that!
[01:10:34.961 --> 01:10:39.765]  Am I talking about the devil worship story with her chief of staff or campaign chairman?
[01:10:39.765 --> 01:10:45.150]  Looking at the menu of blood and semen and body parts at the Alistair Crowley event?
[01:10:45.150 --> 01:10:46.311]  The private event?
[01:10:46.311 --> 01:10:47.993]  Oh no, I'm not talking about that!
[01:10:47.993 --> 01:10:58.722]  I mean 200,000 plus dead Christians with her operation with Syria and her operation in Libya and not letting the Christians get out and directing Al Qaeda and ISIS who target and murder
[01:10:59.002 --> 01:10:59.602]  I don't know.
[01:11:10.097 --> 01:11:11.137]  And they con everybody.
[01:11:11.137 --> 01:11:14.218]  They're for open society and they love everybody.
[01:11:14.218 --> 01:11:16.759]  Anything they do is for degradation.
[01:11:16.759 --> 01:11:30.022]  And someone could have been killed inside of your restaurant for no good reason other than people like Alex Jones fanned a conspiracy theory that even the DC police say has no basis in fact.
[01:11:30.022 --> 01:11:34.663]  Yes, it's a pack of lies and it's dangerous.
[01:11:34.663 --> 01:11:36.724]  No, this is completely unfamiliar to me.
[01:11:37.544 --> 01:11:40.427]  Remember you had James Oliphantis on Fox News?
[01:11:40.427 --> 01:11:43.149]  You're talking about fake news?
[01:11:43.149 --> 01:11:44.591]  The guy from Carbon Pizza?
[01:11:44.591 --> 01:11:47.914]  Yes, and then you played a clip of me saying Hillary personally kills children.
[01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:56.072]  I mean all I'm saying is I can send you the right wing watch clip where it first reported it and they said Jones tongue-in-cheek
[01:12:08.723 --> 01:12:10.144]  I'll take a look at that.
[01:12:10.144 --> 01:12:11.446]  That's very unfamiliar to me.
[01:12:11.446 --> 01:12:15.229]  All I can tell you is that I tend to look backwards to ensure that doesn't happen.
[01:12:31.465 --> 01:12:32.405]  Sandy Hook.
[01:12:32.405 --> 01:12:40.948]  Well, Sandy Hook's complex because I've had debates where we've devil's advocate said the whole story's true, and then I've had debates where I've said that none of it's true.
[01:12:40.948 --> 01:12:47.230]  When you say parents faked their children's death, people get very angry.
[01:12:47.230 --> 01:12:52.672]  Yeah, well let's, oh I know, but they don't get angry about the half million dead Iraqis from the sanctions, or they don't get angry about all the illegal- That's a dodge.
[01:12:53.052 --> 01:12:54.434]  No, no, it was not a dodge.
[01:12:54.434 --> 01:12:57.779]  The media never covers all the evil wars it's promoted, all the big things.
[01:12:57.779 --> 01:13:00.123]  That doesn't excuse what you did and said about Newtown.
[01:13:00.123 --> 01:13:00.984]  You know it.
[01:13:00.984 --> 01:13:02.306]  Here's the difference.
[01:13:02.306 --> 01:13:08.756]  I looked at all the angles of Newtown and I made my statements long before the media even picked up on it.
[01:13:09.673 --> 01:13:30.682]  And then once the interview began here at the office in the morning, and then the afternoon, and then night, as she attacked me, as she spent 30, 40 minutes on Pizzagate, and on Newtown, and on saying that I was claiming that Brits deserve to be bombed, and gays deserve to be bombed by Islamists, and I said, no.
[01:13:30.682 --> 01:13:33.803]  Why do they bring them in, and then the Muslims target them?
[01:13:33.803 --> 01:13:35.164]  I'm not blaming them.
[01:13:35.164 --> 01:13:37.865]  I'm saying, why do they not have survival instincts?
[01:13:40.034 --> 01:13:40.454]  I'm sort of...
[01:14:08.288 --> 01:14:08.428]  Okay.
[01:14:32.421 --> 01:14:37.243]  Yeah, and then she went on to promise it's not a hit piece, and promise it's not an investigative journal piece.
[01:14:37.243 --> 01:14:41.625]  And I said, listen, if it is, that's fine, but I want to actually answer your questions.
[01:14:41.625 --> 01:14:48.168]  And then I saw the edit of what they put out in the promo, and it's all cut up to deceive.
[01:14:49.113 --> 01:14:54.118]  And that's why NBC, I told them when I was there, they were asking, I said, oh no, I'm not taping.
[01:14:54.118 --> 01:14:57.162]  No, just my crew right next to us sitting there in chairs were taping.
[01:14:57.162 --> 01:14:58.583]  Of course we were taping.
[01:14:58.583 --> 01:15:01.807]  And you know, if you want to get really technical, you know, we fight big brother with big brother.
[01:15:01.807 --> 01:15:04.289]  I guess we haven't even got into the HD cameras or the microphones.
[01:15:04.770 --> 01:15:07.012]  You know, that we've got in some of the areas of the office.
[01:15:07.012 --> 01:15:11.295]  We don't have it inside our individual offices, but we've got it at the front doors, other places.
[01:15:11.295 --> 01:15:15.178]  I want a full review of all the surveillance cameras and the audio at the front doors.
[01:15:15.178 --> 01:15:18.141]  I bet we can catch some real crap talking on those.
[01:15:18.141 --> 01:15:19.161]  And then let's catch them in the street.
[01:15:19.161 --> 01:15:20.583]  Let's boost audio all the way on that, too.
[01:15:20.583 --> 01:15:21.583]  Let's go all the way with these people.
[01:15:21.583 --> 01:15:24.085]  I mean, they want to play games, they want to edit me, they want to do this.
[01:15:24.085 --> 01:15:25.426]  I let them go there first.
[01:15:25.426 --> 01:15:27.828]  I waited until they put out a deceptive promo.
[01:15:27.828 --> 01:15:30.510]  I waited until she said, oh, it's a big investigative report.
[01:15:30.510 --> 01:15:30.811]  By the way,
[01:15:31.698 --> 01:15:35.580]  I knew that she was interviewing Newtown people three weeks ago.
[01:15:35.580 --> 01:15:39.842]  Some of them couldn't keep their mouths shut and were talking to folks about it and tweeting it.
[01:15:39.842 --> 01:15:41.142]  So I mean, I walked right into her trap.
[01:15:41.142 --> 01:15:43.623]  People say, well, why do I walk into traps?
[01:15:43.623 --> 01:15:46.525]  Because she said it was a piece and she wasn't interviewing anybody else.
[01:15:46.525 --> 01:15:48.886]  She wasn't interviewing Mike's wife and blah, blah, blah.
[01:15:48.886 --> 01:15:51.507]  And then I just knew it was all a load of manure.
[01:15:51.507 --> 01:15:52.907]  And people say, well, then why did you do that?
[01:15:52.907 --> 01:15:54.848]  Because I believe in God.
[01:15:54.848 --> 01:15:56.789]  There's not just evil in this world.
[01:15:56.789 --> 01:15:58.430]  And so I pray to God.
[01:15:59.403 --> 01:16:02.048]  That justice come out of this and that the truth be seen.
[01:16:02.048 --> 01:16:05.974]  Well, do they put up light under my face?
[01:16:05.974 --> 01:16:06.816]  Do they demonize me?
[01:16:06.816 --> 01:16:07.717]  Do they edit me?
[01:16:07.717 --> 01:16:08.999]  Will they hurt me physically?
[01:16:10.117 --> 01:16:12.699]  Will they hurt me in the eyes of dumb people?
[01:16:12.699 --> 01:16:19.325]  But when some dumb person walks over and knocks my glass over, slaps me in the back of the head, or says, I hope you die, you know, I just feel sorry for them.
[01:16:19.325 --> 01:16:22.588]  And I just say, I'm so sorry that the media has manipulated you.
[01:16:22.588 --> 01:16:24.930]  You know, I didn't really say those things.
[01:16:24.930 --> 01:16:26.471]  You just want to feel outraged.
[01:16:26.471 --> 01:16:31.375]  You feel like you're part of something, but it's the globalists that are actually enslaving your future.
[01:16:31.375 --> 01:16:33.337]  Now, Dr. Corsi joins us for the balance of the hour.
[01:16:33.337 --> 01:16:35.499]  He has big intel from our White House sources.
[01:16:36.733 --> 01:16:36.913]  I don't
[01:16:57.014 --> 01:16:59.957]  Okay, everybody says Farr is coming, he Farr is coming, now he's a bad guy.
[01:16:59.957 --> 01:17:04.361]  Well, the unitary executive, the president, unless he's selling out the country, can do whatever he wants.
[01:17:04.361 --> 01:17:05.402]  But they don't care.
[01:17:05.402 --> 01:17:16.632]  Even under current congressional views of a weakened president, the FBI now being the real presidency, because the FBI is above all three branches of government, with the media, it is the new government.
[01:17:17.012 --> 01:17:18.233]  That's why they're on such power trips.
[01:17:18.233 --> 01:17:25.340]  They act like Comey's this royalty and, you know, Mueller's this royalty and he's hired this army of people to go after our American president.
[01:17:25.340 --> 01:17:29.725]  The Clintons could commit all the crimes, the sellouts to China, the globalists.
[01:17:29.725 --> 01:17:30.826]  They could do all of this.
[01:17:32.274 --> 01:17:35.696]  And commit it publicly, and Loretta Lynch should order investigations to stop.
[01:17:35.696 --> 01:17:37.016]  That's all okay!
[01:17:37.016 --> 01:17:41.538]  But because this guy's a real president, here comes Mueller, we're all supposed to shake in fear.
[01:17:41.538 --> 01:17:47.780]  The FBI is destroying itself in self-immolation right now, just like Megyn Kelly and all of them.
[01:17:47.780 --> 01:17:49.481]  They don't get it.
[01:17:49.481 --> 01:17:54.823]  And I'm not saying the whole FBI's bad, but all of you that are FBI agents, you need to know something.
[01:17:54.823 --> 01:17:55.964]  You think this is a power trip?
[01:17:56.670 --> 01:17:57.991]  This is despicable.
[01:17:57.991 --> 01:17:59.632]  This is disgusting.
[01:17:59.632 --> 01:18:02.715]  And remember when the stock market crashes if they destroy Trump.
[01:18:02.715 --> 01:18:06.458]  And remember, remember when your family is on the street.
[01:18:06.458 --> 01:18:08.579]  Remember, you did this to America.
[01:18:08.579 --> 01:18:08.920]  You!
[01:18:08.920 --> 01:18:11.542]  Along with the whore media and the rest of it.
[01:18:11.542 --> 01:18:12.983]  Dr. Corsi's got his sources.
[01:18:12.983 --> 01:18:15.885]  He knows what the White House strategy is to counter all this.
[01:18:15.885 --> 01:18:22.731]  I mean, it's an amazing time to see what a lion Trump is surrounded by these hyenas.
[01:18:23.291 --> 01:18:29.799]  Well, the first thing to realize is that I think Donald Trump understands that his presidency is on the line.
[01:18:29.799 --> 01:18:38.490]  The goal right now of the special prosecutor, Mueller, is to produce enough information to impeach Donald Trump.
[01:18:38.490 --> 01:18:39.110]  That's the game.
[01:18:40.083 --> 01:18:45.507]  Now, Trump, you've got to remember to give turncoat Republicans enough cover to do what they've always wanted.
[01:18:45.507 --> 01:18:46.028]  That's right.
[01:18:46.028 --> 01:18:48.890]  In order to get Pence in there, whom they're comfortable with.
[01:18:48.890 --> 01:18:51.212]  He's a GOP, more establishment figure.
[01:18:51.212 --> 01:18:56.296]  Donald Trump's too threatening, even to the Paul Ryan ally.
[01:18:56.296 --> 01:19:00.660]  And by the way, Stone, everybody said this six months ago, but they clearly now are trying to anoint Pence.
[01:19:00.660 --> 01:19:03.162]  And watch, they're going to go after Pence once he's in.
[01:19:03.402 --> 01:19:04.123]  Oh, of course.
[01:19:04.123 --> 01:19:08.045]  At least Pence they think is one of the club.
[01:19:08.045 --> 01:19:09.686]  He's a former congressman.
[01:19:09.686 --> 01:19:10.807]  They think he'll play along.
[01:19:10.807 --> 01:19:12.848]  He's certainly better than Trump.
[01:19:12.848 --> 01:19:13.989]  He's a midwestern Christian.
[01:19:13.989 --> 01:19:15.630]  They're going to destroy him, too.
[01:19:15.630 --> 01:19:17.251]  I agree.
[01:19:17.251 --> 01:19:24.556]  What's at play here is a very important article that's just come out this morning on Zero Hedge.
[01:19:24.556 --> 01:19:28.419]  It's all about this Rod Rosenstein.
[01:19:28.419 --> 01:19:30.100]  Who may recuse himself.
[01:19:30.100 --> 01:19:30.280]  Yes.
[01:19:33.562 --> 01:19:39.907]  The Democrats lost the argument on Russia, and that was destroyed with Sessions testimony.
[01:19:39.907 --> 01:19:41.168]  They went to obstruction.
[01:19:41.168 --> 01:19:42.469]  They went to obstruction.
[01:19:42.469 --> 01:19:49.015]  Now, obstruction means that they're trying to investigate the Comey firing, and Rosenstein will have to recuse himself.
[01:19:49.015 --> 01:19:49.735]  Stay there.
[01:19:49.735 --> 01:19:51.136]  You'll get the floor when we come back.
[01:19:51.136 --> 01:19:51.897]  But Trump's right.
[01:19:51.897 --> 01:19:54.379]  This is the most empty witch hunt.
[01:19:54.379 --> 01:19:59.103]  I mean, this is like the witch hunt to end all witch hunts, to destroy America.
[01:20:00.871 --> 01:20:03.473]  Hunters, anglers, campers and survivalists.
[01:20:03.473 --> 01:20:04.534]  Get back to nature.

[01:21:19.375 --> 01:21:25.278]  I've gone from a snug 36-inch waist to a 32-inch waist, which I was in high school.
[01:21:25.278 --> 01:21:28.339]  I highly recommend the Android 400 to all my friends.

[01:24:09.793 --> 01:24:14.834]  Will America rally to his aid or will we again fall to the globalists?
[01:24:14.834 --> 01:24:15.674]  Talk about a witch hunt.
[01:24:34.398 --> 01:24:35.438]  We have found the witch!
[01:24:35.438 --> 01:24:36.179]  Might we burn her?
[01:24:36.179 --> 01:24:36.959]  Burn her!
[01:24:36.959 --> 01:24:37.619]  Burn her!
[01:24:37.619 --> 01:24:39.720]  Burn her!
[01:24:39.720 --> 01:24:41.420]  Who do you know she is a witch?
[01:24:41.420 --> 01:24:44.521]  She looks like one!
[01:24:44.521 --> 01:24:46.762]  Bring her forward!
[01:24:46.762 --> 01:24:47.863]  I'm not a witch!
[01:24:47.863 --> 01:24:49.543]  I'm not a witch!
[01:24:49.543 --> 01:24:51.204]  But you are dressed as one!
[01:24:51.204 --> 01:24:52.804]  They dress me up like this!
[01:24:52.804 --> 01:24:55.125]  And this isn't my nose!
[01:24:55.125 --> 01:25:00.007]  It's a false one!
[01:25:00.007 --> 01:25:00.327]  Well?
[01:25:00.327 --> 01:25:02.868]  What, we did you the nose?
[01:25:02.868 --> 01:25:03.428]  The nose?
[01:25:04.261 --> 01:25:04.922]  And the hat.
[01:25:04.922 --> 01:25:05.982]  But she's a witch!
[01:25:05.982 --> 01:25:13.908]  Did you dress her up like this?
[01:25:13.908 --> 01:25:14.228]  No!
[01:25:14.228 --> 01:25:14.829]  Yes.
[01:25:14.829 --> 01:25:15.189]  A bit.
[01:25:15.189 --> 01:25:18.671]  She has got a wart.
[01:25:18.671 --> 01:25:20.773]  What makes you think she's a witch?
[01:25:20.773 --> 01:25:23.895]  Well, she turned me into a newt!
[01:25:23.895 --> 01:25:26.737]  A newt?
[01:25:26.737 --> 01:25:27.278]  I can't better.
[01:25:27.278 --> 01:25:30.480]  Burn her, Eddie!
[01:25:34.981 --> 01:25:40.462]  All right, of course, this is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[01:25:40.462 --> 01:25:42.142]  You'll have the floor to really flesh this out.
[01:25:42.142 --> 01:25:59.426]  But what do you think, from our studies, from our research and our sources, is Trump's strategy with this ridiculous witch hunt that they've now put in all these Democratic operatives that admit, and they're all chortling, that they're going to make up a case on him, an obstruction, when under the unitary executive he could do whatever he wanted, but he didn't even do that.
[01:26:00.006 --> 01:26:07.771]  Well, Trump's got a very complicated, but very, I think, highly probable success strategy in place with his lawyers.
[01:26:07.771 --> 01:26:08.371]  Well, he better!
[01:26:08.371 --> 01:26:09.972]  He's fighting a load of manure!
[01:26:09.972 --> 01:26:15.515]  And he is going to, I've always said, he always looks like he's going to lose just before he wins.
[01:26:15.515 --> 01:26:18.237]  And there's a two-fold strategy going on here.
[01:26:18.237 --> 01:26:28.863]  One is with a legal team, and I want to explain it, because we're going to very quickly see a very conservative person start to exert influence within the Justice Department.
[01:26:29.803 --> 01:26:36.786]  And I think you're going to find Trump is going to go on the change the story initiative today with his speech in Miami.
[01:26:36.786 --> 01:26:40.348]  It's going to take much more charge over the national narrative.
[01:26:40.348 --> 01:26:50.132]  I think there's also going to be a lot more restraint put on the mainstream media and less free access to do an ACT UP session every day on television within the White House in the press room.
[01:26:50.712 --> 01:26:52.553]  So Trump is really aware of the strategy.
[01:26:52.553 --> 01:26:53.814]  He's been listening.
[01:26:53.814 --> 01:27:02.819]  And when we detail, I want to give you a few of the details of exactly what they're going to do to fight back on this Mueller and his investigation.
[01:27:02.819 --> 01:27:06.281]  And I think Trump has a strategy in place which is likely to succeed.
[01:27:06.281 --> 01:27:07.602]  He's going to need support.
[01:27:07.602 --> 01:27:12.044]  And I want to explain to people why I think Trump is going to win.
[01:27:12.044 --> 01:27:13.125]  Shall we start into it now?
[01:27:13.125 --> 01:27:14.025]  Yes.
[01:27:14.025 --> 01:27:14.926]  OK, well, first of all,
[01:27:15.922 --> 01:27:18.384]  You've got Mueller who is conducting this investigation.
[01:27:18.384 --> 01:27:27.130]  The key article on Zero Hedge about Rosenstein, see the Democrats made a major mistake.
[01:27:27.130 --> 01:27:34.136]  When they got Sessions in testimony, Sessions was correct that he had an executive he could exert
[01:27:34.716 --> 01:27:37.640]  A privilege not to testify about conversations with
[01:27:52.619 --> 01:28:08.348]  Tom, the 1982 memo that was written to President Reagan by his Assistant Attorney General Olsen, who laid out that the Attorney General can not answer questions about conversations with the President in order to give the President a chance to exert executive privilege.
[01:28:08.348 --> 01:28:10.509]  And that's exactly what Sessions did.
[01:28:10.509 --> 01:28:14.712]  Sessions also deconstructed totally this whole Russian narrative.
[01:28:14.712 --> 01:28:18.214]  And even Chris Wallace indicated that the Russian story is dead.
[01:28:19.042 --> 01:28:23.785]  Now once that happened, the Democrats morphed into making it obstruction.
[01:28:23.785 --> 01:28:26.808]  And by the way, I gotta say, you and Stone, everybody said that six months ago.
[01:28:26.808 --> 01:28:33.372]  They said when they're done and this horse falls over dead, they're gonna beat that to death for a while and then they're gonna move on to obstruction.
[01:28:33.372 --> 01:28:35.974]  Yes, and that's the next, now we're in the obstruction phase.
[01:28:35.974 --> 01:28:46.582]  And the problem is that this Rod Rosenstein is gonna have to recuse himself because he wrote the order or the analysis that got Comey fired.
[01:28:47.282 --> 01:29:02.410]  Okay, now the next person in line, if Rosenstein is out, is a woman named Rachel Brand, who was just recently appointed to the Department of Justice by President Trump and is a member of the Federalist Society.
[01:29:02.410 --> 01:29:03.410]  Good.
[01:29:03.410 --> 01:29:06.672]  So she is going to be solidly in charge, I think, within the next
[01:29:07.852 --> 01:29:11.234]  And Federalist means they know the President, in his purview, has power.
[01:29:11.234 --> 01:29:12.314]  And the Constitution.
[01:29:12.314 --> 01:29:14.575]  She is a student of the Constitution.
[01:29:14.575 --> 01:29:15.876]  She's a conservative.
[01:29:15.876 --> 01:29:17.857]  She's appointed by Trump.
[01:29:17.857 --> 01:29:19.678]  Trump, I think, finally... And let's be clear.
[01:29:19.678 --> 01:29:23.800]  I'm not a fan of the President having absolute power, but you can debate the separation of powers here.
[01:29:23.800 --> 01:29:31.103]  The FBI has no right, when it's under the executive, to just be running around claiming it's the fourth branch of government with supremacy.
[01:29:31.423 --> 01:29:36.925]  Well, that's exactly right, and I think this is going to be a major move for Trump to get back into the Oval Department.
[01:29:36.925 --> 01:29:37.285]  Stay there!
[01:29:37.285 --> 01:29:40.866]  Let's break it all down with expert analysis from Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[01:29:40.866 --> 01:29:43.167]  The president is the president, not the FBI.
[01:29:43.167 --> 01:29:45.448]  James Comey and Mueller are not the president.
[01:29:45.448 --> 01:29:48.809]  Even though they're arrogant, they're so arrogant they make me sick.
[01:29:48.809 --> 01:29:49.950]  What traitors this country.
[01:29:49.950 --> 01:29:53.851]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.851 --> 01:29:56.532]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.155 --> 01:30:10.122]  Following the liberal outcry over Megyn Kelly interviewing Alex Jones, NBC News executives have been scrambling to further edit their hit piece on Alex Jones.
[01:30:10.122 --> 01:30:22.471]  The word now is that Megyn Kelly has changed her Sunday night show featuring Alex Jones' interview by inviting Sandy Hook families on to play edited clips of Alex talking while they have the parents emotionally respond.
[01:30:22.471 --> 01:30:30.037]  One thing is for sure, with how long it's taking NBC to edit Megyn Kelly's interview with Alex Jones prior to just airing it, we can expect
[01:30:30.077 --> 01:30:34.359]  I expect that they will be misrepresenting his statements with skilled editing techniques.
[01:30:34.359 --> 01:30:39.502]  Why not just release the entire interview unedited and prove you're not fake news, NBC?
[01:30:39.502 --> 01:30:48.347]  They'd like you to believe that Alex Jones, not Adam Lanza, is the real bad guy in the Sandy Hook massacre because he said he believes there was a government conspiracy at work.
[01:30:48.587 --> 01:30:58.455]  However, all of this will backfire on the mainstream media as everyday Americans are increasingly becoming more aware of the staging, faking, and lying that is the mainstream media.
[01:30:58.455 --> 01:31:01.038]  For more reports, go to InfoWars.com.

[01:31:50.498 --> 01:31:52.159]  10% off on AutoShip.

[01:32:00.788 --> 01:32:11.373]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[01:32:11.373 --> 01:32:13.434]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[01:32:13.434 --> 01:32:16.296]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[01:32:16.296 --> 01:32:17.796]  It's made in the USA.
[01:32:17.796 --> 01:32:20.918]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are
[01:32:21.158 --> 01:32:24.600]  Absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[01:32:24.600 --> 01:32:26.701]  It is a classical 360 win.
[01:32:26.701 --> 01:32:36.285]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[01:32:36.425 --> 01:32:53.220]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[01:32:53.220 --> 01:32:56.523]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[01:32:56.523 --> 01:33:00.126]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Field and InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:33:09.244 --> 01:33:31.171]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:31.171 --> 01:33:35.192]  Closer, more unified, so important.
[01:33:36.630 --> 01:33:46.613]  So we all owe Steve a big, big thank you.
[01:33:46.613 --> 01:33:58.597]  And let's keep the Warmbier family and the Scalise family and all of the victims of the congressional shooting in our hearts and prayers.
[01:33:58.597 --> 01:34:01.258]  And it was quite a day.
[01:34:01.258 --> 01:34:03.939]  And our police officers were incredible, weren't they?
[01:34:03.939 --> 01:34:05.880]  They did a great job.
[01:34:05.880 --> 01:34:06.200]  Thank you.
[01:34:11.132 --> 01:34:18.797]  And let us all pray for a future of peace, unity and safety for all of our people.
[01:34:18.797 --> 01:34:20.398]  Thank you.
[01:34:20.398 --> 01:34:23.080]  And for Cuba.
[01:34:23.080 --> 01:34:35.428]  I am so thrilled to be back here with all of my friends in Little Havana.
[01:34:35.428 --> 01:34:38.450]  I love it.
[01:34:38.450 --> 01:34:39.271]  I love this city.
[01:34:40.743 --> 01:34:42.585]  And what are the big thank you?
[01:34:42.585 --> 01:34:47.930]  Thank you.
[01:34:47.930 --> 01:34:50.832]  Now, this is an amazing community.
[01:34:50.832 --> 01:34:52.534]  The Cuban-American community.
[01:34:52.534 --> 01:34:54.115]  There's so much love.
[01:34:54.115 --> 01:34:56.618]  I saw that immediately.
[01:34:56.618 --> 01:34:58.659]  Thank you, darling.
[01:34:58.659 --> 01:34:59.760]  Oh, do I love you too.
[01:35:02.836 --> 01:35:11.566]  What you've built here, a vibrant culture, a thriving neighborhood, the spirit of adventure, is a testament to what a free Cuba could be.
[01:35:11.566 --> 01:35:16.992]  And with God's help, a free Cuba is what we will soon achieve.
[01:35:19.933 --> 01:35:25.918]  He's going to reverse Obama, which would select corporations being able to go in and exploit the Cubans instead of them totally opening up.
[01:35:25.918 --> 01:35:32.683]  I'm for opening up Cuba if it's a total open up, not work with the dictator Raul, which select deals with Google and others.
[01:35:32.683 --> 01:35:33.303]  No!
[01:35:33.303 --> 01:35:34.805]  No more monopoly capitalism!
[01:35:35.345 --> 01:35:38.886]  Yeah, Trump is going to reverse the globalist strategy right now.
[01:35:38.886 --> 01:35:41.087]  He's going to send the Democrats insane.
[01:35:41.087 --> 01:35:44.267]  Which is put in communists and have them as clients for slave labor.
[01:35:44.267 --> 01:35:49.469]  No, really reform, open up to everybody, don't be like China and have crony capitalism.
[01:35:49.469 --> 01:35:56.831]  Exactly, and all the globalists who thought they were going to win are going to lose today and they're going to go insane.
[01:35:56.831 --> 01:36:00.492]  But look, Trump doesn't look unhappy, he doesn't look worried, he looks very confident.
[01:36:00.492 --> 01:36:00.932]  Look at him.
[01:36:03.095 --> 01:36:07.398]  He doesn't want to have to move against the Democrats with military force, but they are an outside power.
[01:36:07.398 --> 01:36:11.261]  I think he's got a strategy in place.
[01:36:11.261 --> 01:36:13.283]  Let's hear what he has to say.
[01:36:13.283 --> 01:36:17.826]  We are delighted to be joined by so many friends and leaders of our great community.
[01:36:17.826 --> 01:36:19.187]  I want to express our deep gratitude
[01:36:31.502 --> 01:36:34.264]  To a man that's really become a friend of mine.
[01:36:34.264 --> 01:36:37.245]  And I want to tell you, he is one tough competitor.
[01:36:37.245 --> 01:36:39.707]  Senator Marco Rubio.
[01:36:39.707 --> 01:36:45.950]  I remember Rubio... Stone first told me, like, when Trump got elected, that Rubio was actually in the fold.
[01:36:45.950 --> 01:36:47.371]  Rubio.
[01:36:47.371 --> 01:36:49.412]  Man!
[01:36:49.412 --> 01:36:50.693]  That's right there.
[01:36:50.693 --> 01:36:59.298]  He's reversing everything that Obama did because Rubio has stood for freedom in Cuba in opposition to the Castro brothers.
[01:36:59.858 --> 01:37:02.032]  We were just killed at least a half million people.
[01:37:02.032 --> 01:37:02.274]  Right.
[01:37:02.924 --> 01:37:07.165]  Another friend of mine, Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart.
[01:37:07.165 --> 01:37:11.206]  And I'll tell you, I loved what he said and I appreciate it.
[01:37:11.206 --> 01:37:13.786]  Mario, I appreciated what you said.
[01:37:13.786 --> 01:37:14.746]  So much.
[01:37:14.746 --> 01:37:18.607]  Notice under Obama, he banned Cubans coming in because they're libertarians.
[01:37:18.607 --> 01:37:21.068]  See, again, they want people that don't know what communism's like.
[01:37:21.068 --> 01:37:21.548]  Yeah.
[01:37:21.548 --> 01:37:24.088]  Like, bring all the brown people you want from Cuba that don't like communism.
[01:37:24.088 --> 01:37:25.489]  I'm not hiding from brown people.
[01:37:25.489 --> 01:37:26.809]  I'm hiding from socialists.
[01:37:26.809 --> 01:37:31.850]  Well, this was a globalist plan to open Cuba to corporations.
[01:37:33.126 --> 01:37:34.347]  Select globalist corporations.
[01:37:34.347 --> 01:37:35.288]  Select.
[01:37:35.288 --> 01:37:39.472]  They were on the Obama agenda and on the Goldman Sachs plan.
[01:37:39.472 --> 01:37:42.055]  Well, guys, as soon as he gives us the new policy, we'll go back to the President.
[01:37:42.055 --> 01:37:45.278]  I want to get into his strategy, though, with this.
[01:37:45.278 --> 01:37:47.179]  They build it up, make it look like an investigation.
[01:37:47.179 --> 01:37:50.863]  We told you six months ago there will be calls for indictments.
[01:37:50.863 --> 01:37:52.324]  There will be calls for impeachment.
[01:37:52.324 --> 01:37:54.026]  There will be all of this crap.
[01:37:54.026 --> 01:37:56.608]  And I told you up front, from our intel,
[01:37:57.629 --> 01:38:06.293]  Flynn's a great patriot, so above board that he didn't try to hide anything, that he had consulting deals with like seven different countries, Turkey, you name it.
[01:38:06.293 --> 01:38:16.678]  RT paid him $34,000 to come to a gala and speak, and of course he came and spoke, and of course they tried to glad-hand him and stuff, and he had dinner and was, you know, 20 feet from Putin or whatever, and they shook hands.
[01:38:16.678 --> 01:38:17.319]  It's all on video.
[01:38:18.686 --> 01:38:25.428]  He got Russia through back channels when he was the head of Defense Intelligence to start bombing ISIS.
[01:38:25.428 --> 01:38:27.309]  Our military said no to Obama.
[01:38:27.309 --> 01:38:38.013]  He was authorized at the highest levels to do that in a check made against Obama when the real deep state, because there's the patriot deep state and there's the globalist deep state, when our real deep state said we're not part of this.
[01:38:38.013 --> 01:38:39.253]  That's what they're not telling you.
[01:38:39.253 --> 01:38:41.574]  The Civil War isn't just deep state.
[01:38:41.574 --> 01:38:44.575]  It's deep state patriots against deep state bad guys.
[01:38:44.975 --> 01:38:50.019]  Right, and what Trump is doing here, you see, now the Democrats have morphed.
[01:38:50.019 --> 01:38:59.807]  They lost the Russia collusion meme when Sessions testified, and Sessions, even Chris Matthews, said the Russia story's dead.
[01:38:59.807 --> 01:39:01.188]  Now they're into obstruction.
[01:39:01.188 --> 01:39:03.630]  Well, first thing about obstruction is that this
[01:39:05.191 --> 01:39:16.818]  Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is going to have to recuse himself because the obstruction is why was Comey fired and it was Rosenstein who wrote the memo that got Comey fired.
[01:39:16.818 --> 01:39:18.039]  And they act like that's dirty!
[01:39:18.039 --> 01:39:18.960]  No, if a judge...
[01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:26.867]  You know, has, say, a husband or wife or son or whatever, that's in a court case in front of her or he, they have to recuse.
[01:39:26.867 --> 01:39:31.172]  But they know the public's ignorant about legal matters, so they act like it's an admission of guilt.
[01:39:31.172 --> 01:39:38.519]  Right, well see, the key is that racial brand takes over as soon as Rosenstein recuses himself.
[01:39:38.519 --> 01:39:43.104]  And she's a Federalist, she is a constitutionally trained lawyer.
[01:39:43.604 --> 01:39:44.285]  She's one of us.
[01:39:44.285 --> 01:39:51.629]  She believes in the, you know, she's a member of the Federalist Society and she's going to be a strong Trump ally.
[01:39:51.629 --> 01:39:53.050]  She's going to work for Trump.
[01:39:53.050 --> 01:39:54.531]  And it's not just being Trump's ally.
[01:39:54.531 --> 01:39:56.693]  I'm not in some worship fest of Trump.
[01:39:56.693 --> 01:39:58.234]  He is on the right side of history.
[01:39:58.234 --> 01:40:01.256]  He's under total attack by total enemies.
[01:40:01.256 --> 01:40:05.018]  How are people, because I see the articles every day, Trump losing his base, Wall Street Journal.
[01:40:05.018 --> 01:40:06.079]  It's all lies.
[01:40:06.079 --> 01:40:08.701]  His polls are up and they're much higher than they say.
[01:40:08.701 --> 01:40:11.182]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's never been more clear cut.
[01:40:11.182 --> 01:40:12.924]  And so when she takes over,
[01:40:13.984 --> 01:40:17.567]  First of all, now Mueller can come under examination.
[01:40:17.567 --> 01:40:25.674]  Because Mueller has already been hinstropped that Mueller is way afield, that he has not authority to go after this obstruction.
[01:40:25.674 --> 01:40:27.455]  And there's two parts of the obstruction.
[01:40:27.455 --> 01:40:30.598]  One, they can't prove that Donald Trump didn't have the authority.
[01:40:30.598 --> 01:40:36.683]  He had the authority to direct the Department of Justice to do what he wants it to do.
[01:40:36.683 --> 01:40:38.645]  And the remedy there is just impeach him.
[01:40:39.105 --> 01:40:50.769]  But it's not obstruction of justice if he orders, Dershowitz from Harvard Law made the case very clearly that Trump had the authority to end this whole Mueller investigation if he wants.
[01:40:50.769 --> 01:40:51.969]  He's got the authority.
[01:40:51.969 --> 01:40:55.670]  The only remedy is to impeach him and the Democrats don't have the vote.
[01:40:55.670 --> 01:40:59.571]  Now once Rachel Brand takes over, remember this is Cassowich.
[01:40:59.571 --> 01:41:05.293]  Cassowich is the New York attorney who is now heading the legal team for Donald Trump and he's brilliant.
[01:41:06.033 --> 01:41:09.154]  And what they're going to do is they're going to say, turn the tables.
[01:41:09.154 --> 01:41:12.595]  Pretty soon Mueller's going to be under investigation himself.
[01:41:12.595 --> 01:41:22.297]  And they're going to say the real obstruction of justice was what Comey admitted in his testimony under oath that Clinton and Loretta Lynch were conspiring on the tarmac.
[01:41:22.297 --> 01:41:24.378]  And it gets worse under federal law.
[01:41:24.998 --> 01:41:26.579]  Yes, and he also obstructed his own investigation.
[01:41:47.054 --> 01:41:49.536]  He blocked the investigation of the emails.
[01:42:02.065 --> 01:42:03.466]  I've done lots of work with you.
[01:42:03.466 --> 01:42:04.827]  But they really like you.
[01:42:04.827 --> 01:42:08.110]  The average FBI person is pretty hardworking, good, Americana.
[01:42:08.110 --> 01:42:09.992]  Then how can there be such scum at the top?
[01:42:09.992 --> 01:42:12.814]  I guess they fear that, so they put bad guys in at the top.
[01:42:12.814 --> 01:42:15.676]  I mean, what is the FBI itself going to do?
[01:42:15.676 --> 01:42:18.359]  Because we've got all these socialists leaking this info.
[01:42:20.538 --> 01:42:23.839]  You put people into all these agencies who are socialists.
[01:42:23.839 --> 01:42:26.940]  Obama politicized the Department of Justice.
[01:42:26.940 --> 01:42:28.901]  He politicized the IRS.
[01:42:28.901 --> 01:42:30.561]  He politicized the EPA.
[01:42:30.561 --> 01:42:33.382]  So should we see patriots leak criminal activity?
[01:42:33.382 --> 01:42:41.125]  No, what we should do is we should remove it from office and go after... I know, but if people have got the dirt on Mueller and Comey and all them, it's time to burn them.
[01:42:41.125 --> 01:42:44.786]  The people are either going to burn America and burn Trump, or you're going to burn these people.
[01:42:44.946 --> 01:42:45.526]  Okay.
[01:42:45.526 --> 01:42:52.250]  Step one is we get Rachel Brand, who is effectively in charge of the Department of Justice.
[01:42:52.250 --> 01:43:07.658]  Step two is Mueller's going to be exposed, and his ties with the entire Obama team and Comey are going to be exposed, and Mueller's conversations with Comey are going to be investigated to find out if he's not already compromised.
[01:43:07.658 --> 01:43:08.619]  And by the way, let's expand.
[01:43:08.619 --> 01:43:11.841]  Clearly Comey was covering his butt, knowing that as president
[01:43:12.761 --> 01:43:14.942]  Uh, the President has intel that he was the leaker.
[01:43:14.942 --> 01:43:18.764]  He did that to, you know, that outrage that the media tried to cover for.
[01:43:18.764 --> 01:43:21.045]  It's like saying, I've got 20 dead kids in my basement.
[01:43:21.045 --> 01:43:24.146]  Comey just says that I'm the leaker, which Trump had already predicted.
[01:43:24.146 --> 01:43:25.347]  That is incredible!
[01:43:25.347 --> 01:43:26.548]  And there's leaks.
[01:43:26.548 --> 01:43:30.529]  Comey probably is responsible for seven or eight major leaks that can be proved.
[01:43:30.529 --> 01:43:31.870]  And Mueller now is responsible.
[01:43:31.870 --> 01:43:34.711]  And we know he's under testimony saying he didn't leak previously.
[01:43:34.711 --> 01:43:36.192]  If we can catch him, that's more perjury.
[01:43:36.192 --> 01:43:38.053]  Okay, but see, as Trump plays this out,
[01:43:38.573 --> 01:43:39.034]  I don't know.
[01:43:55.055 --> 01:44:04.321]  Not in a violent way like the left does, but bird-dogging these turncoats and letting them know that we know the game plan and that they are the deciding factor.
[01:44:04.321 --> 01:44:06.683]  It is the Paul Ryans and others.
[01:44:06.683 --> 01:44:14.268]  They are where all the leverage, legally and lawfully, and I mean if they're in your family, folks, the country's hanging by a thread.
[01:44:14.268 --> 01:44:15.749]  I don't care who you are out there.
[01:44:15.749 --> 01:44:21.813]  If these turncoat Republicans aren't put in line, we're going to have a giant civil war that the left is openly looking for.
[01:44:23.032 --> 01:44:29.476]  The goal here is, within about 30 days, to have under investigation Comey.
[01:44:29.476 --> 01:44:30.876]  Yeah, yeah, start over, because I've been interrupting.
[01:44:30.876 --> 01:44:32.197]  Start over, I apologize.
[01:44:32.197 --> 01:44:33.918]  No, no problem.
[01:44:33.918 --> 01:44:48.126]  The point is, as soon as we get effective control with Rachel Brand, once Rosenstein recuses himself, you've got the opportunity then to go after Mueller and show how Mueller compromised himself with Comey.
[01:44:48.866 --> 01:44:51.349]  They're conversations, they're private conversations.
[01:44:51.349 --> 01:44:52.750]  We need to know what they were about.
[01:44:52.750 --> 01:45:01.339]  And the leaks that were orchestrated both by Comey and by now Mueller, who's also leaking, are allowing people within his staff to leak.
[01:45:01.339 --> 01:45:03.941]  These are potentially criminal activity.
[01:45:04.793 --> 01:45:26.701]  Now, once this is all exposed, and Mueller is exposed as another Comey operative, another Obama-Clinton operative, then he'll be forced to resign, and the real investigations under the Department of Justice can begin, turning the tables on the Democrats, because it was the Democrats, it was Hillary Clinton and Podesta who were being paid by Russia.
[01:45:27.501 --> 01:45:30.263]  It was Comey who was obstructing justice.
[01:45:30.263 --> 01:45:36.787]  Everything Clinton was doing in this campaign, they're now blaming... Not going after Hillary!
[01:45:36.787 --> 01:45:47.893]  Imagine, Trump's coming in, they've obstructed justice on the email, on the servers, on the uranium, on the missiles, on China, on everything, working the Arab Spring, selling us out to Islam.
[01:45:47.893 --> 01:45:52.436]  They're the ones that the government, the good people in the government, are all mad about, bipartisanly.
[01:45:52.436 --> 01:45:53.397]  How do they turn it around?
[01:45:53.397 --> 01:45:55.038]  They come in and flip the narrative.
[01:45:55.658 --> 01:45:59.459]  On to Trump, and then emblematic, look at DrudgeReport.com.
[01:45:59.459 --> 01:46:02.220]  Could Illinois be the first state to file for bankruptcy?
[01:46:02.220 --> 01:46:04.840]  You know, just like we've seen happen with Puerto Rico.
[01:46:04.840 --> 01:46:12.442]  I mean, look everywhere the Democrats run things, they create crime, they create poverty, because they want to be El Jefes.
[01:46:12.442 --> 01:46:15.223]  They want a bunch of poor people under their control.
[01:46:16.043 --> 01:46:23.685]  And the goal, I think, of what Donald Trump's doing in the Justice Department will be soon to have the real investigation start.
[01:46:23.685 --> 01:46:28.046]  The real obstruction is on Comey and the Democrats.
[01:46:28.046 --> 01:46:33.727]  The real collusion with Russia is on Hillary, Podesta, and the Democrats.
[01:46:33.727 --> 01:46:38.908]  They're the ones who sold- And that's why Trump's mad at the Attorney General, who I know is waiting for process to play out.
[01:46:39.688 --> 01:46:40.649]  Trump has nothing to hide.
[01:46:40.649 --> 01:46:43.831]  He's like, dude, they're Chinese and Russian agents.
[01:46:43.831 --> 01:46:45.692]  They're totally sold us out.
[01:46:45.692 --> 01:46:47.613]  They've been caught leaking, committing crimes.
[01:46:47.613 --> 01:46:48.474]  Indict them.
[01:46:48.474 --> 01:47:00.882]  And why has Sessions, who I think is one of the best people ever in the Senate, very good man, but he's almost so goody-two-shoes, he won't do something aggressive even if somebody deserves it.
[01:47:00.882 --> 01:47:03.604]  Sessions had the most brilliant move of all.
[01:47:03.604 --> 01:47:09.068]  He quietly ended, single-handedly, the Russian collusion meme.
[01:47:09.808 --> 01:47:10.788]  He did kill it.
[01:47:10.788 --> 01:47:11.989]  These people are sick.
[01:47:31.616 --> 01:47:37.417]  So you've got a whole nest here in Maryland and of course McAuliffe wants to run for president.
[01:47:37.417 --> 01:47:38.658]  Trump is going to blow this apart.
[01:47:38.658 --> 01:47:40.998]  Exactly, but let's just shift gears into the larger image.
[01:47:40.998 --> 01:47:53.561]  Does the FBI and all the rest of these people get, if you try to remove this president who's like 65% in the polls, you know they add 15 points more in the sample, he's at 65% that's why they're panicking.
[01:47:53.561 --> 01:47:58.382]  If they remove somebody who's just trying to turn the country back on and take it off live support and
[01:47:58.942 --> 01:48:04.846]  You know, the head of Goldman Sachs is making jokes about him trying to turn our infrastructure on and bragging how China's better than us.
[01:48:04.846 --> 01:48:10.711]  I mean, doesn't Hollywood and the Goldman Sachs and the New World Order get that you guys could have money and power.
[01:48:10.711 --> 01:48:18.957]  We don't want war with you, but damn it, you keep trying to kill us and mount our heads on the wall in some, you know, measuring contest to your ding-dongs.
[01:48:18.957 --> 01:48:21.919]  I mean, man, look, we don't want a civil war.
[01:48:21.919 --> 01:48:23.079]  I got a stack of news here.
[01:48:23.900 --> 01:48:27.804]  We're Democrats are calling for hunting Republicans and killing everybody.
[01:48:27.804 --> 01:48:36.033]  I mean, every day they're saying, don't just kill Trump, kill everybody, kill Trump supporters, hunt Republicans, shoot more congressmen.
[01:48:36.033 --> 01:48:38.816]  You know, Huffington Post, too bad he didn't get more people.
[01:48:38.816 --> 01:48:39.016]  What?
[01:48:40.998 --> 01:48:42.899]  I mean, this is out of control!
[01:48:42.899 --> 01:48:47.942]  It's like watching a toddler, you know, running around, writing on the walls with their own crap!
[01:48:47.942 --> 01:48:50.663]  I mean, I just, I don't know how much this we can put up with, Dr. Corsi.
[01:48:50.663 --> 01:48:55.166]  Well, it's, you're now deconstructing Megyn Kelly.
[01:48:55.166 --> 01:49:01.569]  And they set Megyn Kelly on you in order to try to destroy you, destroy us with Infowars.
[01:49:01.569 --> 01:49:03.390]  But the whole point is that's going to fail.
[01:49:03.390 --> 01:49:05.571]  You turned the tide on that, you taped her.
[01:49:05.571 --> 01:49:08.352]  Yeah, because it's not that we're that good, they're lying dirtbags!
[01:49:08.352 --> 01:49:09.213]  And you exposed it.
[01:49:09.713 --> 01:49:15.440]  You've shown their methodology, you've shown how they lie in the mainstream media, how they do hit jobs.
[01:49:15.440 --> 01:49:19.865]  You're deconstructing the mainstream media's hit job methodology.
[01:49:19.865 --> 01:49:25.352]  What Trump, why they're so afraid of Trump, is once Trump really gets a hold of the Justice Department and finds the
[01:49:27.294 --> 01:49:33.081]  The Obama-Clinton loyalists gets people like this Rachel Brandt in charge with Sessions.
[01:49:33.081 --> 01:49:34.362]  They're going to start investing.
[01:49:34.362 --> 01:49:36.785]  The Clintons fired all the Republicans.
[01:49:36.785 --> 01:49:38.167]  The Clintons fired 93 U.S.
[01:49:38.167 --> 01:49:39.048]  Attorneys.
[01:49:39.048 --> 01:49:40.369]  Sessions only 40-something.
[01:49:40.369 --> 01:49:41.670]  He should fire them all!
[01:49:41.670 --> 01:49:42.632]  You're all gone!
[01:49:43.251 --> 01:49:57.862]  But here's the point, this is why the Democrats, this is why they're so insanely going after, kill everybody, civil war, because once Trump begins a legitimate investigation of Comey's obstruction.
[01:49:57.862 --> 01:49:58.743]  It's over.
[01:49:58.743 --> 01:50:00.805]  Once he begins a legitimate investigation.
[01:50:01.525 --> 01:50:05.529]  of the Clintons and the foundation and the Clintons and their money.
[01:50:19.281 --> 01:50:21.162]  Understand that.
[01:50:21.162 --> 01:50:24.243]  I cannot hype to you how much danger the country's in.
[01:50:24.243 --> 01:50:26.584]  And by the way, we have the upper hand if we use it.
[01:50:26.584 --> 01:50:41.151]  Well, and that Clinton's selling technology, military technology, under the reset to Russia, and getting paid for it through the Clinton Foundation for Speeches, Podesta with his J-O-U-L-E, Julie Stock, we found out about in the WikiLeaks.
[01:50:41.151 --> 01:50:43.932]  It's the Democrats who are scared to death.
[01:50:43.932 --> 01:50:47.093]  The legitimate Department of Justice will investigate them.
[01:50:47.093 --> 01:50:48.054]  You know what my gut tells me?
[01:50:48.934 --> 01:50:50.996]  My gut tells me it's going to be a hard road.
[01:50:50.996 --> 01:50:52.278]  We're going to win, Dr. Corsi.
[01:50:52.278 --> 01:50:55.561]  It's going to be a hard road, but I'm betting on Donald Trump.
[01:50:55.561 --> 01:50:56.322]  We're going to win.
[01:50:56.322 --> 01:50:58.944]  The only way we fail is not taking action.
[01:50:58.944 --> 01:50:59.345]  We'll be back.
[01:51:00.822 --> 01:51:05.604]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water.
[01:51:05.604 --> 01:51:11.486]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way.

[01:54:23.191 --> 01:54:27.454]  Coming up, we've got Trump's statements on Cuba.
[01:54:27.454 --> 01:54:30.857]  Let me tell you right now, Trump will tighten, but not nix Cuba travel.
[01:54:32.575 --> 01:54:34.997]  And of course the media focuses on travel.
[01:54:34.997 --> 01:54:39.360]  What needs to be focused on in the policies is that we're not going to let U.S.
[01:54:39.360 --> 01:54:45.364]  companies selectively go in and pay Raul and decide the winners and losers.
[01:54:45.364 --> 01:54:48.266]  This needs to be wide open or it doesn't need to be done.
[01:54:48.266 --> 01:54:52.649]  This is so fundamental to understanding globalism, crony capitalism, all of it.
[01:54:52.649 --> 01:54:58.133]  We should not allow the left and the big leftist corporations to exploit Cuba like they've done China.
[01:54:59.045 --> 01:55:03.429]  Well, and this is going to also be part of taking the narrative back.
[01:55:03.429 --> 01:55:11.337]  Trump is going to have a series of speeches, a series of getting back into the public, a series of rallies.
[01:55:11.337 --> 01:55:17.203]  But this whole idea of reversing Obama's policies on Cuba is designed to make a major impact.
[01:55:17.203 --> 01:55:21.688]  I think the left will go insane on it, and it's going to change the narrative away from obstruction.
[01:55:23.112 --> 01:55:32.017]  The point is, on this obstruction issue, I think Trump is in the process of setting the stage for the Democrats to be under investigation.
[01:55:32.017 --> 01:55:38.220]  And when they are, when the real obstruction, which Comey's already admitted to under oath, he said that he obstructed
[01:55:38.920 --> 01:55:47.041]  Uh, the, that Lorena Lynch had involved herself to ask him to tone down the investigation of Hillary Clinton during the campaign.
[01:55:47.041 --> 01:55:48.182]  That's obstruction.
[01:55:48.182 --> 01:55:49.642]  That's the type of issue they're looking for.
[01:55:49.642 --> 01:55:51.262]  And they know Trump's got all the intel.
[01:55:51.262 --> 01:55:53.543]  He was covering his ass and all that for the crimes he committed.
[01:55:53.543 --> 01:55:57.203]  And Trump has got all the intel on the Clinton Foundation.
[01:55:57.203 --> 01:55:59.324]  You've got Charles Ortel's work.
[01:55:59.324 --> 01:55:59.984]  I wrote a book.
[01:55:59.984 --> 01:56:04.624]  Peter Schweitzer wrote a book on the Clinton Crime Syndicate, which is the Clinton Foundation.
[01:56:04.624 --> 01:56:06.565]  That's all going to be investigated.
[01:56:06.565 --> 01:56:07.305]  You've got Hillary.
[01:56:07.785 --> 01:56:34.944]  Stay there, do five more minutes, and then we've got a lady who was a big establishment feminist, the Father's Day coming up, and then when she actually studied it, she saw men are going out of work, men are falling apart, men are committing suicide, and it's designed, and when men fall, women fall, the idea that men and women are separate is the most asinine, we're all one species, there is no man, there is no woman, there is humanity, there is our children, doesn't mean we hate anybody that's, you know, into something else, that's all part of human expression, but there is a war against humanity.
[01:56:34.944 --> 01:56:36.966]  Do five more minutes with me and we have this amazing guest of
[01:56:37.566 --> 01:56:42.290]  Uh, who, uh, you know, put out the film Red Pill and more information, so that's coming up.
[01:56:42.290 --> 01:56:46.893]  Briefly, because Nico keeps explaining to me, hey, if you never plug, we won't be able to fund the operation.
[01:56:46.893 --> 01:56:48.014]  Uh, we have record audience.
[01:56:48.014 --> 01:56:50.175]  We have biggest audience we've ever had for the summertime.
[01:56:51.069 --> 01:56:54.012]  Bigger than it was last year during the campaign.
[01:56:54.012 --> 01:57:00.999]  But financially, they took about $5 million of our advertising away, banning us on Google Ads, and we've barely tried to make that back.
[01:57:00.999 --> 01:57:01.799]  It sounds like a lot of money.
[01:57:01.799 --> 01:57:04.002]  It's not when you're trying to set up bureaus in D.C.
[01:57:04.002 --> 01:57:05.843]  and London and a bunch of other stuff we've got going.
[01:57:05.843 --> 01:57:07.064]  We need funding.
[01:57:07.064 --> 01:57:08.286]  So we don't just ask for donations.
[01:57:08.286 --> 01:57:14.492]  We just say, hey, get great nutraceuticals, great water filtration systems, great Patriot apparel to meet like-minded people, you name it.
[01:57:14.952 --> 01:57:16.214]  We have free shipping, by the way.
[01:57:16.214 --> 01:57:17.555]  We do that only a few times a year.
[01:57:17.555 --> 01:57:21.080]  That's running through next week at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:57:21.080 --> 01:57:23.222]  If you sign up for auto-ship, an additional 10% off.
[01:57:23.222 --> 01:57:25.665]  But, does it matter?
[01:57:25.665 --> 01:57:26.126]  It's great.
[01:57:26.126 --> 01:57:30.491]  Fluoride-free, iodine-slash-tea tree oil-slash-peppermint-slash.
[01:57:31.552 --> 01:57:32.593]  Colloidal Silver Toothpaste.
[01:57:32.593 --> 01:57:33.694]  Nobody ever did that.
[01:57:33.694 --> 01:57:36.616]  We have the biggest manufacturer of organic toothpaste in the country making it.
[01:57:36.616 --> 01:57:37.657]  That's a bestseller.
[01:57:37.657 --> 01:57:42.680]  We've got the X2 Good Halogen with the Biotricillinium that go together electrochemically.
[01:57:42.680 --> 01:57:45.242]  Just see what Mother Nature does, ladies and gentlemen.

[01:57:50.666 --> 01:57:52.347]  And I cannot impress upon you how critical it is
[01:57:58.411 --> 01:57:59.431]  To buy the products.
[01:57:59.431 --> 01:58:00.792]  They're great products you need.
[01:58:00.792 --> 01:58:03.753]  They're great products that have made my life so much better.
[01:58:03.753 --> 01:58:08.315]  But it also funds an organization that's changing the world.
[01:58:08.315 --> 01:58:11.576]  This is the equivalent of war bonds in World War II.
[01:58:11.576 --> 01:58:15.098]  Or the equivalent of George Washington having to sell little American flags, you know, to try to
[01:58:15.558 --> 01:58:17.039]  You know, get money to buy bullets.
[01:58:17.039 --> 01:58:21.642]  I mean, if we don't have the bullets, we can't prosecute the war.
[01:58:21.642 --> 01:58:24.704]  And I don't want to just sit here and stasis the same size.
[01:58:24.704 --> 01:58:26.525]  Big fish eat little fish.
[01:58:26.525 --> 01:58:29.266]  We need to get big in the face of the enemy.
[01:58:29.266 --> 01:58:31.608]  Like Doomsday, or the good Doomsday.
[01:58:31.608 --> 01:58:33.169]  We're Doomsday to the New World Order.
[01:58:33.169 --> 01:58:35.790]  I mean, you know, every time they've hit us, we've gotten bigger.
[01:58:35.790 --> 01:58:39.292]  We need to do that equation one more time, and we win.

[01:59:56.479 --> 01:59:59.521]  Yeah, if you want to go into communist China, folks, you gotta go through their generals.
[01:59:59.521 --> 02:00:00.181]  Same thing in Cuba.
[02:00:12.091 --> 02:00:14.732]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:14.732 --> 02:00:20.393]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:00:20.393 --> 02:00:27.034]  We actually have President Trump's
[02:00:40.939 --> 02:00:44.101]  Press release, talking points, we need to get that published if we can during the break.
[02:00:44.101 --> 02:00:47.464]  On Infowars.com, I'm not even sure anybody has this yet, we just got the text of it.
[02:00:47.464 --> 02:00:49.405]  It's just released by the White House right now.
[02:00:49.405 --> 02:00:51.947]  Yeah, to us first, so we need to get that out.
[02:00:51.947 --> 02:00:56.631]  Of course you literally get stuff a lot of times, 20 minutes before anybody else does.
[02:00:56.631 --> 02:01:01.895]  From who we won't say, but let's just say hi up in the federal government, looking at this unfolding,
[02:01:03.243 --> 02:01:06.804]  It's exactly what I said without even hearing Trump's full speech.
[02:01:06.804 --> 02:01:10.686]  The Chinese military runs who can come into China and do business through combines.
[02:01:10.686 --> 02:01:11.806]  It's the same thing in Cuba.
[02:01:11.806 --> 02:01:18.349]  And we're saying if you want to open Cuba up, let Cuban individuals deal directly with any company they want.
[02:01:18.829 --> 02:01:24.191]  Don't let a bunch of fat cat generals come in and exploit the amazing, hard-working, beautiful Cuban people.
[02:01:24.191 --> 02:01:27.093]  And then, sure enough, we've got the actual White House policy.
[02:01:27.093 --> 02:01:28.133]  Tell folks, Dr. Corsi.
[02:01:28.133 --> 02:01:35.196]  Well, the policy channels economic activities away from the Cuban military monopoly.
[02:01:35.196 --> 02:01:47.042]  It includes a whole series of travel-related transactions that will allow American individuals and businesses to develop economic ties to the private small business sector in Cuba.
[02:01:47.802 --> 02:01:59.265]  The new policy makes clear that the primary obstacles to the Cuban people's prosperity and economic freedom is the Cuban military's practice of controlling virtually every profitable sector of the economy.
[02:01:59.265 --> 02:02:06.187]  And that is such a gift to the Cuban people, who have such a verdant, beautiful, diverse country.
[02:02:06.187 --> 02:02:08.928]  I mean, from what I've read and what I've seen, Cuba is a jewel.
[02:02:09.508 --> 02:02:21.018]  Right, President Trump's policy changes will encourage American commerce and free Cuban businesses to pressure the Cuban government to allow the Cuban people to expand the private sector.
[02:02:21.018 --> 02:02:29.085]  Cuba's under a dictatorship, and I'm so sick of Jesse Ventura, who's a nice guy overall, and others, because Fidel patted him on the head, making excuses for it.
[02:02:29.085 --> 02:02:30.647]  They killed hundreds of thousands of people.
[02:02:31.482 --> 02:02:40.328]  Right, and this reverses Obama's whole policy, which would have played into the hands of the... Doesn't the Cuban military get the power structure?
[02:02:40.328 --> 02:02:42.509]  The rich guys there, it's like Blank Fine.
[02:02:42.509 --> 02:02:46.592]  They make record money at Goldman Sachs, but still want to stop Trump, because some of the money is getting to the people.
[02:02:46.592 --> 02:02:50.595]  Doesn't the Cuban military know if they get out of the way, they're already in dominant positions?
[02:02:50.595 --> 02:02:52.096]  They'll make 50 times the money?
[02:02:52.096 --> 02:02:53.297]  It's the global... They're idiots!
[02:02:53.797 --> 02:02:58.962]  The global strategy is a suicidal strategy that... Amenishing returns!
[02:02:58.962 --> 02:03:01.084]  ...that Hillary wants to follow.
[02:03:01.084 --> 02:03:04.807]  I mean, Hillary Obama... We were talking to high-level folks this morning, and they all get it.
[02:03:04.807 --> 02:03:07.790]  This globalism isn't good for business!
[02:03:07.790 --> 02:03:08.790]  But it's good for the...
[02:03:09.591 --> 02:03:12.873]  They're good for jerks and everybody else poor.
[02:03:12.873 --> 02:03:13.853]  But then Obama goes to...
[02:03:29.203 --> 02:03:31.324]  Africa, and says you can't have cars or air conditioning.
[02:03:31.324 --> 02:03:38.927]  Right, and see, the people under these policies, just like in America, you end up with 92 million people who can't find a job, who want work.
[02:03:38.927 --> 02:03:44.469]  The globalists don't care, because they're having all the money at the top, and they have, it's a suicide.
[02:03:44.469 --> 02:03:51.732]  And then they have the nerve to come out and say, hunt and kill Republicans, the Democrats have put out the hashtag, because they're rich and aren't giving you da money.
[02:03:52.452 --> 02:03:57.456]  Dumbasses, free markets, what gives you the money and the spaceships and the medicine?
[02:03:57.456 --> 02:03:59.638]  Not Venezuela, not North Korea, not Cuba.
[02:03:59.638 --> 02:04:03.341]  Yeah, they got more doctors per capita anywhere in the world than Cuba.
[02:04:03.341 --> 02:04:05.183]  And when your knee goes out, they give you a cane.
[02:04:05.183 --> 02:04:07.265]  And when your eyes go out, they give you a cane.
[02:04:08.041 --> 02:04:13.863]  And Alex, also I think it's a demonstration that the White House is listening to what we're talking about.
[02:04:13.863 --> 02:04:19.825]  I laid out a three-part policy as to how you'd beat this propaganda campaign of the Democrats.
[02:04:19.825 --> 02:04:21.445]  First, you change the subject.
[02:04:21.445 --> 02:04:23.846]  Again, Donald Trump's changed the subject today.
[02:04:23.846 --> 02:04:26.927]  Cuba's going to be the news cycle through the weekend.
[02:04:27.407 --> 02:04:30.388]  Secondly, you have to silence the mainstream media.
[02:04:30.388 --> 02:04:34.029]  Get them out of the White House press room, act up hour on TV.
[02:04:34.029 --> 02:04:42.732]  And third, you've got to counter-attack, and Kasich, the new attorney that Trump has in the White House, is doing a brilliant, I think, strategy.
[02:04:42.732 --> 02:04:47.414]  That's right, because we've got Sessions recusing, and now we've got the deputy recusing.
[02:04:47.414 --> 02:04:51.355]  She's in charge now, and the word is she'll actually execute Order No.
[02:04:51.355 --> 02:04:51.395]  66.
[02:04:51.395 --> 02:04:52.716]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:52.716 --> 02:04:53.096]  Stay with us.
[02:05:00.987 --> 02:05:09.951]  Following the liberal outcry over Megyn Kelly interviewing Alex Jones, NBC News executives have been scrambling to further edit their hit piece on Alex Jones.
[02:05:09.951 --> 02:05:20.136]  The word now is that Megyn Kelly has changed her Sunday night show featuring Alex Jones' interview by inviting Sandy Hook families on to play edited clips of Alex talking while they have the
[02:05:20.236 --> 02:05:22.297]  Parents emotionally respond.
[02:05:22.297 --> 02:05:34.204]  One thing is for sure, with how long it's taking NBC to edit Megyn Kelly's interview with Alex Jones prior to just airing it, we can expect that they will be misrepresenting his statements with skilled editing techniques.
[02:05:34.204 --> 02:05:39.348]  Why not just release the entire interview unedited and prove you're not fake news, NBC?
[02:05:39.348 --> 02:05:48.193]  They'd like you to believe that Alex Jones, not Adam Lanza, is the real bad guy in the Sandy Hook massacre because he said he believes there was a government conspiracy at work.
[02:05:48.433 --> 02:05:58.282]  However, all of this will backfire on the mainstream media, as everyday Americans are increasingly becoming more aware of the staging, faking, and lying that is the mainstream media.
[02:05:58.282 --> 02:06:03.726]  For more reports, go to InfoWars.com.
[02:06:03.726 --> 02:06:05.108]  Let's go to David in Florida.
[02:06:05.108 --> 02:06:06.389]  David in Florida, you're on the air.
[02:06:07.341 --> 02:06:07.781]  Great!
[02:06:07.781 --> 02:06:08.922]  Hey, thank you so much.
[02:06:08.922 --> 02:06:13.445]  Listen, I have bought your products and I gotta say they're amazing.
[02:06:13.445 --> 02:06:15.146]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it.
[02:06:15.146 --> 02:06:22.711]  Because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret Swell, 5mm Fusion, I've got the Body Armor.
[02:06:22.711 --> 02:06:23.531]  Wow, thank you.
[02:06:23.531 --> 02:06:25.873]  You're the top of the list that makes it all possible.
[02:06:25.873 --> 02:06:27.514]  Which Nutra-Certicals do you like best?
[02:06:27.754 --> 02:06:31.235]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, to be honest.
[02:06:31.235 --> 02:06:32.515]  That's really incredible.
[02:06:32.515 --> 02:06:35.896]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[02:06:35.896 --> 02:06:36.896]  I haven't felt this week.
[02:06:36.896 --> 02:06:38.577]  My morning was fantastic.
[02:06:38.577 --> 02:06:39.837]  And I love you guys.
[02:06:39.837 --> 02:06:41.978]  I love the Info Wars crew.
[02:06:41.978 --> 02:06:48.839]  And I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it.
[02:06:48.839 --> 02:06:49.879]  You will love it.
[02:06:49.879 --> 02:06:51.700]  I'm telling you, I've never bought a bad product.
[02:06:52.020 --> 02:06:56.443]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:06:56.443 --> 02:07:00.886]  It's a win-win, InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:07:00.886 --> 02:07:02.807]  Embrix Essentials, that's my middle name.
[02:07:02.807 --> 02:07:15.254]  I've spent seven years off and on trying to get a big national brand that's already trusted to let us private label an entire line of personal care products that's organic, high quality.
[02:07:15.254 --> 02:07:21.018]  This is one of the top three selling organic brands in the country that puts out
[02:07:21.198 --> 02:07:24.381]  High-quality organic shampoo, mouthwash, you name it.
[02:07:24.381 --> 02:07:29.025]  And they're such patriots, they have let us basically keep their well-known packaging.
[02:07:29.025 --> 02:07:36.151]  It is an answer to prayer, and because we're cutting out the middleman, 20% off retail, sign up for auto-ship, an additional 25% off.
[02:07:36.151 --> 02:07:37.292]  It's all there.
[02:07:37.292 --> 02:07:42.737]  The body wash, the shampoo, the deodorant, the mouthwash, all of it is truly game-changing.
[02:07:42.737 --> 02:07:46.600]  It is the exact same product, just the name is different, Emrix Essentials,
[02:07:46.860 --> 02:07:53.445]  And it's on average 20% off what it would be in stores, buying it directly from InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:07:53.445 --> 02:07:56.067]  Help us win the Info War while getting products everybody needs.
[02:07:56.067 --> 02:08:00.130]  InfoWarsLife.com, where you'll find the entire line of Emmerich's essentials.
[02:08:06.016 --> 02:08:08.117]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:08.117 --> 02:08:09.957]  Because there's a war on.
[02:08:09.957 --> 02:08:11.978]  Or you're mine.
[02:08:11.978 --> 02:08:14.258]  The film is The Red Pill.
[02:08:14.258 --> 02:08:19.580]  We're about to be talking to the director of the documentary, Her Investigation Changed Her View of the World.
[02:08:19.580 --> 02:08:25.782]  Here's the trailer.
[02:08:25.782 --> 02:08:33.144]  One in three American women have been found guilty of raping a West Virginia teenager.
[02:08:35.347 --> 02:08:41.812]  Misogynist rantings would be at home in the far-reaching internet subculture widely described as the men's rights movement.
[02:08:41.812 --> 02:08:52.679]  Declaring the month of October to be bash a violent... I decided to go where no feminist has gone before and meet these men's rights activists.
[02:08:54.893 --> 02:09:00.919]  Men and boys are in crisis and they need your support because they are human beings too.
[02:09:00.919 --> 02:09:05.463]  And you will not shame anybody here into silence about it anymore.
[02:09:08.951 --> 02:09:15.958]  Every society survived based on its ability to train its sons to be disposable.
[02:09:15.958 --> 02:09:16.259]  The U.S.
[02:09:16.259 --> 02:09:18.761]  government does not want to send you to die.
[02:09:18.761 --> 02:09:20.663]  They'd rather send me to die.
[02:09:20.663 --> 02:09:24.187]  93% of workplace fatalities are men.
[02:09:24.187 --> 02:09:25.909]  Four of five suicides.
[02:09:25.909 --> 02:09:28.812]  The family court system truly is biased against men.
[02:09:28.812 --> 02:09:30.173]  I mean, there's just no question about it.
[02:09:30.393 --> 02:09:32.874]  How can anybody not be angered by it?
[02:09:32.874 --> 02:09:37.956]  But if you start to talk about those issues, people get hostile.
[02:09:37.956 --> 02:09:40.517]  You are a f***ing scum.
[02:09:40.517 --> 02:09:43.638]  We're somehow disempowered because we're white men.
[02:09:43.638 --> 02:09:45.019]  Maybe it's just because you're pathetic.
[02:09:46.400 --> 02:09:48.781]  The paradigm that most people live by.
[02:09:48.781 --> 02:09:52.743]  Men have all the power, women don't make the same money for the same work.
[02:09:52.743 --> 02:09:54.324]  That is feminist training.
[02:09:54.324 --> 02:09:57.606]  Flexibility in roles is where we should be all headed.
[02:09:57.606 --> 02:10:02.008]  So where do the men's movement and feminism disagree?
[02:10:02.008 --> 02:10:07.090]  Is the men's rights movement the gender version of the white nationalist movement?
[02:10:07.090 --> 02:10:09.852]  The men's rights movement is part of the backlash.
[02:10:09.852 --> 02:10:13.473]  Grandfather's generation probably had it pretty well.
[02:10:13.473 --> 02:10:14.194]  You know, grow up.
[02:10:15.285 --> 02:10:18.748]  She told her friend she's going to trick me into unfathering the child.
[02:10:18.748 --> 02:10:21.810]  I called a bunch of domestic violence shelters.
[02:10:21.810 --> 02:10:24.852]  Every place said, we don't help men.
[02:10:24.852 --> 02:10:29.536]  When I reported my domestic assault, I did not bring up the fact that I was sexually assaulted.
[02:10:29.536 --> 02:10:34.120]  There was no way he was going to believe that I was going to be a victim of sexual assault.
[02:10:34.120 --> 02:10:37.482]  Although evil's the world's for patriarchy, but we're the ones dying.
[02:10:37.482 --> 02:10:38.763]  And we die for you guys.
[02:10:38.763 --> 02:10:41.305]  I don't know where I'm headed, but I believe.
[02:10:44.249 --> 02:10:46.191]  This is not flattering to men.
[02:10:46.191 --> 02:10:47.872]  Talk about men's vulnerabilities.
[02:10:47.872 --> 02:10:49.333]  We're not blaming men.
[02:10:49.333 --> 02:10:54.878]  We've just named everything bad after them.
[02:10:54.878 --> 02:11:02.144]  I think I agree with everything you said, but there's still some kind of unsettling doubt.
[02:11:02.144 --> 02:11:05.727]  Talk about great work, and of course, Mike Cernovich is involved in this film as well.
[02:11:05.727 --> 02:11:06.888]  That is just so exciting.
[02:11:06.888 --> 02:11:08.209]  He'll be hosting the fourth hour today.
[02:11:10.742 --> 02:11:16.532]  I'm going to go to our guest here in just a moment, but I just want to point out that
[02:11:18.710 --> 02:11:19.750]  It's so ridiculous.
[02:11:19.750 --> 02:11:23.611]  It's like saying, are male and female whales oppressing each other?
[02:11:23.611 --> 02:11:26.352]  Or are male and female toucans?
[02:11:26.352 --> 02:11:27.072]  Like, who's bad?
[02:11:27.072 --> 02:11:29.193]  The male toucan or the female toucan?
[02:11:29.193 --> 02:11:30.313]  You're like, no, those are birds.
[02:11:30.313 --> 02:11:31.173]  That's a species.
[02:11:31.173 --> 02:11:36.094]  And, you know, the male goes off and gets worms and stuff and fruit and brings it back to the mom.
[02:11:36.094 --> 02:11:37.555]  It's not that she's a slave.
[02:11:37.555 --> 02:11:38.275]  She's having the eggs.
[02:11:38.275 --> 02:11:39.675]  She's sitting on top of them.
[02:11:39.675 --> 02:11:40.816]  And men don't have a uterus.
[02:11:40.816 --> 02:11:41.256]  Women do.
[02:11:42.396 --> 02:11:43.338]  It's the species.
[02:11:43.338 --> 02:11:45.542]  Men and women are the species.
[02:11:45.542 --> 02:11:48.848]  And this hasn't been done...
[02:11:50.816 --> 02:11:52.938]  By accident.
[02:11:52.938 --> 02:11:57.102]  The social engineers admit they want to totally scramble things.
[02:11:57.102 --> 02:12:11.275]  They knew when they started saying women go to work and pay taxes and don't give your kids, you know, breast milk, that they were trying to remove women from the family so that the family could be terminated and so that a whole new civilization could be set up.
[02:12:11.275 --> 02:12:13.337]  Humans are being turned into machines.
[02:12:13.337 --> 02:12:16.440]  Does that not mean there aren't cultures where men end up oppressing women?
[02:12:17.060 --> 02:12:26.910]  Of course, it's like ants go out and, you know, hijack and kidnap aphids, and then bring them down into their subterranean lairs and, you know, enslave them.
[02:12:26.910 --> 02:12:28.751]  This stuff goes on.
[02:12:28.751 --> 02:12:30.934]  But you have to look at the whole process.
[02:12:34.224 --> 02:12:43.691]  You have to look at the whole process and see how it's scientific and then pull back from it and see how they're atomizing us all.
[02:12:43.691 --> 02:12:45.992]  They're all isolating everybody.
[02:12:45.992 --> 02:12:47.613]  And men aren't going to college.
[02:12:47.613 --> 02:12:50.996]  Men are, in every metric, just imploding, falling apart.
[02:12:50.996 --> 02:12:53.097]  Is that like, yay, women are getting ahead?
[02:12:53.097 --> 02:12:53.898]  You know, there's a photo.
[02:12:55.123 --> 02:13:04.130]  On DrudgeReport.com, like more than a decade ago, Rachel Maddow and Tucker Carlson on TV together, and Rachel Maddow looks like a woman.
[02:13:04.130 --> 02:13:05.271]  She looks cute.
[02:13:05.271 --> 02:13:09.754]  It's not bad if she wants to look like a man, but it's what they started getting Megyn Kelly to look like a man.
[02:13:09.754 --> 02:13:11.716]  It's like, what are they doing?
[02:13:11.716 --> 02:13:15.479]  The goal is to get rid of the sexes.
[02:13:15.479 --> 02:13:18.421]  Now they've got a hundred plus sexual preferences on Facebook.
[02:13:18.421 --> 02:13:19.402]  It's not about freedom.
[02:13:19.402 --> 02:13:21.023]  It's about attacking being male.
[02:13:22.731 --> 02:13:26.133]  And being female, it's social engineering.
[02:13:26.133 --> 02:13:33.036]  So Cassie J is a filmmaker based in the San Francisco Bay Area and founder and CEO of Jane Bird Productions.
[02:13:33.036 --> 02:13:34.617]  I'm just so excited about this.
[02:13:34.617 --> 02:13:43.482]  She has directed and produced over a dozen films and documentaries, but is most known for her feature documentaries, Daddy I Do, about purity balls.
[02:13:44.690 --> 02:13:46.471]  But absences, pledges.
[02:13:46.471 --> 02:13:49.392]  I think absences, pledges are where your kids really go crazy.
[02:13:49.392 --> 02:13:58.017]  The Right to Love, an American family about the fight for same-sex marriage rights, and her latest film, The Red Pill, which examines men's rights movement.
[02:13:58.017 --> 02:13:59.738]  And again, that film is now out.
[02:13:59.738 --> 02:14:04.940]  She won 15 awards, including Best Documentary at the Cannes Independent Film Festival in France.
[02:14:04.940 --> 02:14:07.862]  And she joins us now, theredpillmovie.com.
[02:14:08.542 --> 02:14:14.583]  Again, winner of the Excellence in Directing Documentary, just a whole bunch of other awards she's gotten.
[02:14:14.583 --> 02:14:14.964]  So, Ms.
[02:14:14.964 --> 02:14:17.104]  Jay, good to have you on with us.
[02:14:17.104 --> 02:14:18.844]  Wow, what a powerful film.
[02:14:18.844 --> 02:14:21.665]  I can't wait to show it to my children.
[02:14:21.665 --> 02:14:22.845]  Oh, thank you.
[02:14:22.845 --> 02:14:29.447]  I put a lot into three and a half years of making The Red Pill, so I hope it helps people better understand the genders.
[02:14:30.419 --> 02:14:31.140]  Absolutely.
[02:14:31.140 --> 02:14:33.343]  Well, of course, there are no genders now.
[02:14:33.343 --> 02:14:34.364]  There is no male or female.
[02:14:34.364 --> 02:14:38.450]  There's only the new big pharma and five daddies, five mommies.
[02:14:38.450 --> 02:14:40.693]  And if you're a gay guy, you have five daddies.
[02:14:40.693 --> 02:14:42.455]  If you're a woman, you have five mommies.
[02:14:42.455 --> 02:14:44.538]  Because men and women are separate and are at war with each other.
[02:14:47.703 --> 02:15:05.653]  Well, before Making a Red Pill I was a staunch feminist of about 10 years and that really shaped the way that I looked at men and women and Making a Red Pill gave me new insight into the disadvantages that men have and the advantages that women have.
[02:15:05.653 --> 02:15:14.859]  Break down your process or just how the film started out and then obviously you've seen the film and as you start to
[02:15:16.607 --> 02:15:20.628]  Become, I guess, conflicted, you know, trying to juxtapose all this.
[02:15:22.139 --> 02:15:25.060]  Well, so it was March 2013.
[02:15:25.060 --> 02:15:26.920]  I was looking for my next film project.
[02:15:26.920 --> 02:15:32.461]  I just completed Right to Love, which was about gay marriage before it was legal across the nation.
[02:15:32.461 --> 02:15:39.203]  And I thought I was going to make a film about rape culture because that was blowing up my news feed.
[02:15:39.203 --> 02:15:46.665]  And so I started looking into rape culture and they commonly talk about rape apologists and people who are perpetuating rape culture blame the victim.
[02:15:47.325 --> 02:16:00.917]  So I tried to find these rape apologists and that led me down the Googling rabbit hole that took me to A Voice for Men dot com, which is one of the largest men's rights groups and forums online.
[02:16:00.917 --> 02:16:04.780]  And I was shocked by what I was reading on A Voice for Men.
[02:16:04.780 --> 02:16:07.803]  I had never heard of these different talking points before.
[02:16:09.244 --> 02:16:19.711]  Also, there had never been a film about the men's rights movement, and they really started to get going around the 70s, but they didn't catch wind like feminism, the second wave feminism did.
[02:16:19.711 --> 02:16:30.379]  But Warren Farrell authored the book The Myth of Male Power in the 90s, and that led to a lot of these men's rights groups springing up like A Voice for Men.
[02:16:31.059 --> 02:16:41.044]  So, this had never been explored in a film before, and as a feminist, I thought, I'm going to go interview these men's rights activists and expose them for what they truly are.
[02:16:41.044 --> 02:16:50.388]  And I thought that was going to be showing the men who perpetuate rape culture and are misogynists and want to put women back in the kitchen, barefoot and pregnant.
[02:16:50.388 --> 02:16:55.331]  And if you watch the Red Pill film, you'll see that the truth was not that.
[02:16:57.230 --> 02:16:58.291]  Well, I know this.
[02:16:58.291 --> 02:17:00.673]  The globalists say they want to replace us all with robots.
[02:17:00.673 --> 02:17:02.114]  They say the future doesn't need us.
[02:17:02.114 --> 02:17:06.597]  Humanity itself is all breathing the same toxic garbage that led to Mercury.
[02:17:07.549 --> 02:17:09.270]  All of us, male, female.
[02:17:09.270 --> 02:17:16.132]  I have male family that dies of cancer, female family that dies of cancer.
[02:17:16.132 --> 02:17:19.913]  The species has to develop systems for ourselves.
[02:17:19.913 --> 02:17:23.374]  Just for me, I just don't even see any division.
[02:17:23.374 --> 02:17:26.815]  Clearly, in every mammal species, males take the risk.
[02:17:27.475 --> 02:17:30.717]  But females take the risk of then having the babies and going through all that stress.
[02:17:30.717 --> 02:17:32.959]  Females are stronger genetically.
[02:17:32.959 --> 02:17:35.100]  Females carry a second set of DNA.
[02:17:35.100 --> 02:17:38.622]  You want to get into real genetic engineering, there's only females.
[02:17:38.622 --> 02:17:47.128]  And then females basically then produce some males with attributes for going out and foraging and then bringing back food.
[02:17:47.128 --> 02:17:49.310]  And then now we're in this more modern society.
[02:17:49.310 --> 02:17:54.273]  And so the attack on males is an attack on women, is an attack on the species by a scientific elite.
[02:17:54.273 --> 02:17:57.295]  I mean, if you study the larger picture, this is a very sophisticated
[02:17:58.375 --> 02:18:00.236]  Yes.
[02:18:00.236 --> 02:18:03.178]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:18:03.178 --> 02:18:06.999]  Feminists have said that the men's rights movement is backlash to feminism.
[02:18:06.999 --> 02:18:20.706]  And I think in some ways that is correct, because because feminism and how it's grown and its prominence and kind of popularity, especially in the past 10 years with social media, it it has defined the
[02:18:23.709 --> 02:18:28.876]  What we should think about genders and when we should get offended, such as if you say that... Exactly!
[02:18:28.876 --> 02:18:32.921]  They're defining what genders are in reality.
[02:18:32.921 --> 02:18:37.868]  They're setting themselves up, not even women, the social engineers are setting themselves up as the new priesthood.
[02:18:37.868 --> 02:18:38.509]  It's a new religion.
[02:18:40.583 --> 02:18:45.649]  Well, in a lot of ways, I would agree with you on that, and I know I'm going to get a lot of flack for that.
[02:18:45.649 --> 02:18:48.272]  I'm even going to get flack for being on the show, but thank you for having me on.
[02:18:48.272 --> 02:18:50.575]  That's a good thing!
[02:18:50.575 --> 02:18:56.422]  But yeah, I also left a religion when I was in my late teens, and that's when I became feminist.
[02:18:57.583 --> 02:19:12.115]  After making the Red Pill movie, I dropped the label of feminism, and in a lot of ways, I know this is going to, you know, offend a lot of people, but in a lot of ways, my leaving a religion and also leaving feminism was a very similar experience for me.
[02:19:12.115 --> 02:19:18.140]  And so it does completely change your worldview, and that's why the film is called The Red Pill.
[02:19:18.140 --> 02:19:22.603]  I cannot see the world the same way again, and I don't think anyone who does watch the film can see the world the same way again.
[02:19:22.603 --> 02:19:22.923]  Wow.
[02:19:22.923 --> 02:19:25.866]  What you just said is so powerful because, you know, it just clicked for me.
[02:19:27.159 --> 02:19:30.482]  Out of these false religions and controlled systems, we get self-confidence.
[02:19:30.482 --> 02:19:40.271]  But if you truly get into humanity, and our great struggle, and our ancestors, and this great saga we've been through, that's the great empowerment.
[02:19:40.271 --> 02:19:42.192]  That's the confidence that's coming together.
[02:19:43.189 --> 02:19:47.954]  And I think the greatest wound of modern third-wave feminism is its endorsement of radical Islam.
[02:19:47.954 --> 02:19:49.555]  It's a total mental illness.
[02:19:49.555 --> 02:19:51.177]  I want to get your take on that.
[02:19:51.177 --> 02:19:57.823]  The lady that directed and produced all these other great folks, The Red Pill, is our guest.

[02:21:12.888 --> 02:21:15.889]  We all look forward to garden tomatoes and corn on the cob.

[02:22:29.304 --> 02:22:32.165]  Many books have been written regarding the Law of Attraction.

[02:24:08.058 --> 02:24:09.400]  Cassie J is our guest.
[02:24:09.400 --> 02:24:14.406]  Her film's been banned in theaters in Australia.
[02:24:14.406 --> 02:24:17.690]  Because she just dared go out and have humanity.
[02:24:17.690 --> 02:24:19.512]  Not woman, not male.
[02:24:19.512 --> 02:24:20.893]  Just humanity.
[02:24:20.893 --> 02:24:22.916]  And look, let's get one thing straight.
[02:24:22.916 --> 02:24:26.740]  Men act like a bunch of lazy animals.
[02:24:28.246 --> 02:24:30.627]  In an unchivalrous society.
[02:24:30.627 --> 02:24:32.947]  And humans have always abused each other.
[02:24:32.947 --> 02:24:34.788]  Women have abused men, men women.
[02:24:34.788 --> 02:24:39.049]  Men have been, you know, the warrior ants of the culture.
[02:24:39.049 --> 02:24:42.610]  But everything they do is about women.
[02:24:42.610 --> 02:24:44.030]  Especially the greater men.
[02:24:44.030 --> 02:24:49.652]  And so, the greatest deception is that we're not together.
[02:24:49.652 --> 02:24:53.253]  And the better a civilization, the more it treats women with reverence.
[02:24:53.253 --> 02:24:54.353]  But you see the West now.
[02:24:55.851 --> 02:25:01.916]  I mean, I was there just six months ago, the day after the inauguration, where they were beating everybody up trying to go in to hear Trump be inaugurated.
[02:25:01.916 --> 02:25:09.442]  And then we're not beating them up, and there are over a million women, and they were putting on hijabs and saying, we do this for Islam, and Muslims were leading it.
[02:25:09.442 --> 02:25:14.306]  And I mean, Islam is like, it's like should be feminist, you know, enemy.
[02:25:14.306 --> 02:25:15.447]  But see, it's not about that.
[02:25:15.447 --> 02:25:18.810]  It's about authoritarianism, and it's about bringing down the West.
[02:25:18.810 --> 02:25:22.393]  And so I think modern feminism is the most wounded now.
[02:25:25.006 --> 02:25:31.010]  Because they have bought into Islam.
[02:25:31.010 --> 02:25:36.554]  And so I want to go back to our guest and talk about this amazing film that Mike Cernovich is a producer on.
[02:25:36.554 --> 02:25:40.577]  That's what's so great about Mike, he's involved in so many great things, he's going to be hosting the next hour.
[02:25:40.577 --> 02:25:46.361]  What about the juxtaposing, this is a short segment, long segment coming up, what about the juxtaposing of
[02:25:48.954 --> 02:25:58.860]  Islam and feminism, modern corporate feminism, not saying anything.
[02:25:58.860 --> 02:26:04.124]  Well, it's obviously a touchy subject and it's something I don't include in the film.
[02:26:04.124 --> 02:26:08.787]  I don't know if I could ever make a film about this topic because I do think it'd be too dangerous.
[02:26:11.946 --> 02:26:23.777]  Part of why I dropped the feminist label after making the Red Pill movie is, actually, the main reason why I dropped the feminist label was because I started to see the hypocrisy within feminism.
[02:26:23.777 --> 02:26:29.442]  So it wasn't necessarily learning about men's issues from men's rights activists that made me leave feminism.
[02:26:29.442 --> 02:26:31.264]  And I'm not a men's rights activist, just to clarify.
[02:26:34.139 --> 02:26:44.272]  Learning more about feminism and how they do want to silence discussion and they are not consistent with their view of protecting and empowering women.
[02:26:44.272 --> 02:26:48.317]  And I think their stance on Islam is part of that.
[02:26:49.246 --> 02:26:59.797]  Why is there, unless you disagree, an obsession with pulling down the West in third-wave feminism, when the West is what put women on a pedestal almost to a ridiculous level?
[02:26:59.797 --> 02:27:00.618]  I mean, I agree.
[02:27:00.618 --> 02:27:05.783]  I don't want... A woman wants to be a tomboy, a woman wants to be an executive, or a woman wants to... But women actually are drawn to those roles.
[02:27:05.783 --> 02:27:07.505]  It's genetic, and they're the best at it.
[02:27:07.725 --> 02:27:12.127]  But in the main, women are nurturative and creative and, you know, make the nest.
[02:27:12.127 --> 02:27:14.568]  And this is just what we do as a species, but I don't want them.
[02:27:14.568 --> 02:27:15.348]  I've got three daughters.
[02:27:15.348 --> 02:27:18.010]  If they want to be CEO, President, God, I'm all behind it.
[02:27:18.010 --> 02:27:19.690]  I mean, I'm a guy that likes women, period.
[02:27:19.690 --> 02:27:21.591]  I like the company of women, period.
[02:27:21.591 --> 02:27:25.853]  This idea is an alpha male that I don't like women is the opposite.
[02:27:28.670 --> 02:27:46.731]  Well, my personal view is that the reason feminism has chosen to protect Islam and not criticize it or critique it in any way is I think it's a part of being a voting bloc because conservatives, especially in the U.S., have really
[02:27:47.452 --> 02:27:48.493]  So it's a cold-blooded alliance?
[02:27:48.493 --> 02:27:49.794]  You could say it like that.
[02:27:49.794 --> 02:27:51.075]  Wow, where do you see this going then?
[02:28:17.257 --> 02:28:19.224]  Uh, gosh, well...
[02:28:20.927 --> 02:28:43.888]  It doesn't look like a very positive future if we keep down this path that we're going down, but I do hope that the Red Pill at least shows a more nuanced conversation around feminism and men's issues so that we can start to work together and point out the hypocrisies on either side.
[02:28:43.888 --> 02:28:47.111]  Also, something that I would like to mention is that the best
[02:28:47.711 --> 02:28:55.313]  Result out of making the Red Pill movie was it positively influenced my relationship with my now fiance.
[02:28:55.313 --> 02:29:10.958]  We've been together six years and so I was with him for two years before making the Red Pill movie and then he stuck with me the entire making of the Red Pill and our relationship has just gotten tenfold times better.
[02:29:10.958 --> 02:29:12.399]  The power of a man and woman
[02:29:12.859 --> 02:29:16.202]  Combining forces and using each other's skills.
[02:29:16.202 --> 02:29:17.963]  It's the complete human.
[02:29:17.963 --> 02:29:20.565]  The humanity is the man and woman coming together.
[02:29:20.565 --> 02:29:21.625]  That's the magic.
[02:29:21.625 --> 02:29:22.826]  That's the power.
[02:29:22.826 --> 02:29:26.929]  And when that happens with those two forces together, it's the universe.
[02:29:26.929 --> 02:29:27.890]  It's the seed of the universe.
[02:29:27.890 --> 02:29:28.390]  It's life.
[02:29:28.390 --> 02:29:29.911]  It's God.
[02:29:29.911 --> 02:29:30.932]  I mean, that's what it is.
[02:29:30.932 --> 02:29:34.955]  That's why these globalists want to destroy that because they want full control.
[02:29:34.955 --> 02:29:41.260]  And when they get men and women fighting with each other and men acting like lazy punks and women being a bunch of, you know, narcissistic loons,
[02:29:42.321 --> 02:29:51.331]  They're all so unhappy so they dig their graves deeper into the modern cultural poison, believing that will deliver them from it when humanity was always there.
[02:29:51.331 --> 02:29:53.774]  Stay there.
[02:29:53.774 --> 02:29:56.457]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.021 --> 02:30:09.984]  Following the liberal outcry over Megyn Kelly interviewing Alex Jones, NBC News executives have been scrambling to further edit their hit piece on Alex Jones.
[02:30:09.984 --> 02:30:22.329]  The word now is that Megyn Kelly has changed her Sunday night show featuring Alex Jones' interview by inviting Sandy Hook families on to play edited clips of Alex talking while they have the parents emotionally respond.
[02:30:22.329 --> 02:30:28.691]  One thing is for sure, with how long it's taking NBC to edit Megyn Kelly's interview with Alex Jones prior to just
[02:30:29.472 --> 02:30:34.236]  We can expect that they will be misrepresenting his statements with skilled editing techniques.
[02:30:34.236 --> 02:30:39.381]  Why not just release the entire interview unedited and prove you're not fake news, NBC?
[02:30:39.381 --> 02:30:48.230]  They'd like you to believe that Alex Jones, not Adam Lanza, is the real bad guy in the Sandy Hook massacre because he said he believes there was a government conspiracy at work.
[02:30:48.450 --> 02:30:58.338]  However, all of this will backfire on the mainstream media, as everyday Americans are increasingly becoming more aware of the staging, faking, and lying that is the mainstream media.
[02:30:58.338 --> 02:31:00.780]  For more reports, go to InfoWars.com.
[02:31:00.780 --> 02:31:02.661]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[02:31:02.661 --> 02:31:04.703]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[02:31:04.703 --> 02:31:07.485]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[02:31:07.485 --> 02:31:10.167]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals,
[02:31:10.367 --> 02:31:13.648]  The elite is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[02:31:13.648 --> 02:31:22.829]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure Groundbreaking Water Filtration Systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[02:31:22.829 --> 02:31:30.370]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children to do the best job you can to purify your air.
[02:31:30.370 --> 02:31:38.392]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[02:31:38.392 --> 02:31:39.352]  The general public doesn't.
[02:31:40.576 --> 02:31:44.521]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[02:31:44.521 --> 02:31:48.085]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[02:31:48.085 --> 02:31:54.813]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[02:31:54.813 --> 02:31:58.898]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:32:00.965 --> 02:32:06.369]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:32:06.369 --> 02:32:09.211]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[02:32:09.211 --> 02:32:11.192]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[02:32:11.192 --> 02:32:16.215]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[02:32:16.215 --> 02:32:18.317]  Research across the board is clear.
[02:32:18.317 --> 02:32:19.617]  In fact, it's certified.
[02:32:19.617 --> 02:32:24.721]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[02:32:24.721 --> 02:32:28.083]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants.
[02:32:29.663 --> 02:32:38.286]  Superblue fluoride-free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula that's loaded with good halogen iodide instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[02:32:38.286 --> 02:32:45.188]  Superblue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[02:32:45.188 --> 02:32:52.690]  Just some of the ingredients in Superblue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver, and more.

[02:33:12.969 --> 02:33:17.654]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:19.517 --> 02:33:25.646]  One of the executive producers, Mike Cernovich, of the film, The Red Pill, what a great name.
[02:33:25.646 --> 02:33:27.989]  I'm thinking about launching, I am launching a bunch of new shows.
[02:33:27.989 --> 02:33:35.500]  We're gonna call it like Reboot America, American Reboot, Red Pill, Adventures, Roundtable Shows, a bunch of things we've got in the hopper.
[02:33:36.638 --> 02:33:38.620]  Thanks to your support.
[02:33:38.620 --> 02:33:40.762]  But listen, we need your financial support.
[02:33:40.762 --> 02:33:44.945]  In fact, quite frankly, I should buy 5,000 or 10,000 of this film and sell it at InfowarsTour.com.
[02:33:44.945 --> 02:33:47.007]  We haven't done that.
[02:33:47.007 --> 02:33:47.728]  We should do that.
[02:33:47.728 --> 02:33:52.572]  That's one way to fund our operation, is to actually sell the films and things we promote.
[02:33:52.572 --> 02:33:58.477]  But whatever you do, get TheRedPillMovie.com because it shows both sides of this.
[02:33:59.673 --> 02:34:02.556]  And the perspective of what women have gone through and what men have gone through.
[02:34:02.556 --> 02:34:10.145]  But it's a human experience as our species goes through all these changes and all these things that are happening.
[02:34:10.145 --> 02:34:15.150]  And then people are trying to artificially manipulate it for political control.
[02:34:15.150 --> 02:34:16.472]  It's a really important documentary.
[02:34:17.765 --> 02:34:18.445]  Really, really important.
[02:34:18.445 --> 02:34:21.626]  You know, we have another film, The Good American, with William Benning.
[02:34:21.626 --> 02:34:22.927]  That's at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:34:22.927 --> 02:34:23.587]  Everybody should get it.
[02:34:23.587 --> 02:34:26.968]  But the red pill is something everybody needs in their library.
[02:34:26.968 --> 02:34:27.568]  You should get it.
[02:34:27.568 --> 02:34:27.948]  Watch it.
[02:34:27.948 --> 02:34:32.310]  Donate it to your local library so that people can see it.
[02:34:32.310 --> 02:34:34.950]  You know, because it's not dogmatic.
[02:34:34.950 --> 02:34:38.552]  It's just somebody's experience, common sense, looking at both sides.
[02:34:38.552 --> 02:34:39.532]  It brings us together.
[02:34:39.532 --> 02:34:43.013]  And I think that's why the social engineer is masquerading as leftist.
[02:34:44.059 --> 02:34:48.042]  Are trying to shut it down, but IMDB gives it an unprecedented 3,470 votes and 8.8.
[02:34:48.042 --> 02:34:53.427]  You never, I mean, Stanley Kubrick films barely get that.
[02:34:53.427 --> 02:34:56.329]  So my films get like sevens and stuff, which is pretty good.
[02:34:56.329 --> 02:34:58.411]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen, the red pill.
[02:35:09.410 --> 02:35:20.918]  Please also understand that we sell water filtration, non-GMO heirloom seeds, shirts, Patriot apparel, high quality supplements, freeze dryers from Harvest Right Discounted.
[02:35:20.918 --> 02:35:23.781]  When you buy products at InfoWarsTore.com
[02:35:24.963 --> 02:35:29.467]  You're financing a global revolution against the technocrats and against dehumanization.
[02:35:29.467 --> 02:35:30.728]  And you see why they're attacking us.
[02:35:30.728 --> 02:35:35.311]  I mean, you get high-quality shampoo that's a brand name in Whole Foods for 20% off.
[02:35:35.311 --> 02:35:37.033]  Sinopharato, you have an additional 25% off.
[02:35:37.033 --> 02:35:38.394]  That's 45% off.
[02:35:38.394 --> 02:35:39.675]  That's going to end next week, by the way.
[02:35:39.675 --> 02:35:41.797]  I've got to stop doing that because it makes no money, basically.
[02:35:41.797 --> 02:35:44.519]  We've got the, you know, organic deodorant.
[02:35:44.519 --> 02:35:45.380]  We've got it all there.
[02:35:45.380 --> 02:35:49.923]  We've got the fluoride-free toothpaste, Super Blue, with the colloidal silver and iodine.
[02:35:49.923 --> 02:35:51.965]  Infowarstore.com.
[02:35:51.965 --> 02:35:54.147]  And we've got Super Mel Vitality and Super Female Vitality.
[02:35:54.767 --> 02:35:57.009]  Which is basically the same formula.
[02:35:57.009 --> 02:36:00.333]  There's just a little bit of one other herb in the female.
[02:36:00.333 --> 02:36:02.735]  And if people want to have male and female, that's fine.
[02:36:02.735 --> 02:36:03.276]  It's the truth.
[02:36:03.276 --> 02:36:05.458]  We're so close, it's the same thing almost.
[02:36:05.458 --> 02:36:07.961]  That's just concentrated herbs into an oil form.
[02:36:07.961 --> 02:36:09.382]  Libido, stamina, energy.
[02:36:10.620 --> 02:36:11.061]  You name it.
[02:36:11.061 --> 02:36:13.623]  I'm not going to get into the technicals of what these well-known herbs do.
[02:36:13.623 --> 02:36:15.365]  Just try it out for yourself.
[02:36:15.365 --> 02:36:17.187]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:36:17.187 --> 02:36:21.411]  We've got the studies out there, of course, on what not having enough selenium does.
[02:36:21.411 --> 02:36:23.694]  We have the BioTrue from the mustard seed.
[02:36:23.694 --> 02:36:25.456]  Totally pure, totally organic.
[02:36:25.456 --> 02:36:26.777]  That's 25% off with the X2.
[02:36:26.777 --> 02:36:27.958]  That's a good halogen.
[02:36:27.958 --> 02:36:29.059]  Look at what's happening to women.
[02:36:29.059 --> 02:36:32.783]  If women don't have iodine particularly, it really jacks them up.
[02:36:34.226 --> 02:36:36.731]  Again, InfoWarsLife.com or 888-253-3139 and you see the full assault.
[02:36:42.267 --> 02:36:44.108]  Taking place against Infowars.
[02:36:44.108 --> 02:36:46.188]  And that's because we're changing the world.
[02:36:46.188 --> 02:36:49.669]  We're returning Americana, which is the vanguard of Renaissance.
[02:36:49.669 --> 02:36:51.249]  It's not some old system.
[02:36:51.249 --> 02:36:52.950]  It's the reboot of humanity.
[02:36:52.950 --> 02:36:57.091]  We're just bringing back plagiarizing 1776 with pleasure.
[02:36:57.091 --> 02:36:58.271]  So again, we need your support.
[02:36:58.271 --> 02:36:59.532]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[02:36:59.532 --> 02:37:01.792]  But today, go to InfowarsStore.com.
[02:37:01.792 --> 02:37:07.034]  But regardless, spread the article, spread the video, spread the video of the behind the scenes with Megyn Kelly.
[02:37:07.034 --> 02:37:08.814]  More is coming over the weekend.
[02:37:08.814 --> 02:37:10.655]  I think I'm going to release.
[02:37:10.655 --> 02:37:11.475]  I think I'm going to release.
[02:37:13.294 --> 02:37:15.696]  The interview she did with me beforehand.
[02:37:15.696 --> 02:37:21.301]  Because then after, they'll just play it and kind of ignore what she really said, what she really did, and how she edited it.
[02:37:21.301 --> 02:37:22.782]  I think I might do that, but we'll see.
[02:37:22.782 --> 02:37:24.023]  There'll be some live feeds this weekend.
[02:37:24.023 --> 02:37:28.728]  We're going to be breaking it all down ahead of what is one of the top stories, if not the top story in the country.
[02:37:28.728 --> 02:37:38.496]  But going back to the director and the lady that is in the middle of this, of the film, The Red Pill Movie dot com, Red Pill, let's
[02:37:40.138 --> 02:37:54.564]  Cassie, go through your experience, go through, because, you know, the classic thing is I'm excited, I'm jumping in, don't worry, I interrupt men even more than women, because I'm like a, you know, wild, wild animal, but spend 10 minutes, you've got the floor, give us a speech about your process, your life, the world, where you see it going.
[02:37:55.626 --> 02:37:57.127]  Oh my goodness.
[02:37:57.127 --> 02:38:08.071]  Okay, so not only did making the Red Pill lead me down a path where I no longer call myself a feminist, but now I really do see through the mainstream media's tactics.
[02:38:08.071 --> 02:38:18.876]  And the process of releasing the Red Pill film really opened my eyes to how manipulated the people are being from the mainstream media.
[02:38:21.597 --> 02:38:27.521]  Men's rights activists told me while I was making the film that if you make an honest film, people will hate you for it.
[02:38:27.521 --> 02:38:28.662]  Feminists will hate you for it.
[02:38:28.662 --> 02:38:34.606]  The mainstream media won't give you, you know, any kind of favorable coverage of this film.
[02:38:34.606 --> 02:38:36.388]  And they were right.
[02:38:36.388 --> 02:38:43.533]  And so, you know, I made The Truth of My Journey, and that is the red pill film, and then I released it in theaters in October.
[02:38:43.533 --> 02:38:46.095]  The first article mainstream
[02:38:46.815 --> 02:38:47.175]  We're good.
[02:39:17.215 --> 02:39:26.481]  And, you know, they're trying to smear my name and the film's credibility, hoping that people won't watch it or think it's propaganda of some sort.
[02:39:26.481 --> 02:39:27.141]  And it's not.
[02:39:27.141 --> 02:39:33.125]  It simply listens to men's rights activists and to feminists and hears their different perspectives on gender.
[02:39:33.125 --> 02:39:38.468]  And the audience is allowed to make their own opinion and find some middle ground of any sort.
[02:39:38.468 --> 02:39:40.449]  It's not promoting any kind of movement or side.
[02:39:42.330 --> 02:39:48.935]  And so the Village Boys kind of set the stage on what the mainstream will think of this film or how they'll write it off.
[02:39:48.935 --> 02:40:02.704]  And after that, the American media, I think, has put a gag order on this film because they haven't released any more kind of mainstream coverage of the Red Pill movies since October.
[02:40:02.704 --> 02:40:05.025]  And that's really your Congressional Medal of Honor right there.
[02:40:05.025 --> 02:40:08.628]  That's the certification when they put those blackout stories there.
[02:40:09.502 --> 02:40:11.043]  Yes.
[02:40:11.043 --> 02:40:16.645]  But we've had a lot of success and discussions in other countries around this film.
[02:40:16.645 --> 02:40:23.429]  So the other territories that really know about this film and are talking about it are Canada, the UK, and Australia.
[02:40:23.429 --> 02:40:25.990]  And Australia in particular I'm going to focus on because they've
[02:40:26.630 --> 02:40:27.711]  We're good to go.
[02:40:43.562 --> 02:40:54.967]  Feminists created petitions to tell Dendy that if you screen this film, we're going to pull all of our, all of our kind of, you know, being a customer at your theater, so you need to pull the film.
[02:40:54.967 --> 02:41:00.889]  And so Dendy was, you know, threatened into submission and they pulled the two screenings there.
[02:41:00.889 --> 02:41:05.851]  Also Palace Cinemas was under attack for screening, having a planned screening of the film.
[02:41:05.851 --> 02:41:08.633]  So Palace Cinemas... This is so authoritarian!
[02:41:08.633 --> 02:41:09.053]  And again,
[02:41:09.713 --> 02:41:14.156]  I mean, your film is so well done, so balanced, the crime is you bring people together.
[02:41:14.156 --> 02:41:19.859]  Yeah, and it's really not propaganda for any side.
[02:41:19.859 --> 02:41:22.640]  You know, I'm very... But it doesn't matter!
[02:41:22.640 --> 02:41:24.321]  You have a right to put it in theaters!
[02:41:24.321 --> 02:41:25.562]  People have a right to go see it!
[02:41:26.274 --> 02:41:41.128]  Yes, yes, and I clearly see there's one side that is engaging in more silencing and censorship than any others, and that is the extreme regressive left with feminists included, and extremist feminists, radical feminists.
[02:41:41.128 --> 02:41:50.497]  I don't think all feminists are like that, but the radical ones are the loudest and are going and creating these petitions and getting films removed from theaters, and I haven't
[02:41:51.298 --> 02:41:56.903]  I've never heard of any other films in recent history that have had this many screenings pulled from theaters.
[02:41:56.903 --> 02:42:01.086]  Well, they're scared of it because you and your fiancé did such a great job and your mom funding it.
[02:42:01.086 --> 02:42:07.492]  Expanding on this, I just want to make this statement and have you continue, but I want to get this out here.
[02:42:07.492 --> 02:42:14.078]  The journey of humanity together as a species is all of our shared ancestry.
[02:42:14.078 --> 02:42:15.439]  We are one species and
[02:42:17.816 --> 02:42:21.778]  The fact that they try to block and censor somebody like you that is just pointing that out.
[02:42:23.996 --> 02:42:30.641]  It's sickening, but this is why people are so upset as we blame men or women because there are a lot of men that blame women for everything.
[02:42:30.641 --> 02:42:32.142]  It's like a cult and I'm sick of it as well.
[02:42:32.142 --> 02:42:33.043]  I mean, let's admit it.
[02:42:33.043 --> 02:42:35.465]  We've been fighting with each other for a long time.
[02:42:35.465 --> 02:42:36.245]  It's stupid.
[02:42:36.245 --> 02:42:37.967]  It's like cancer.
[02:42:37.967 --> 02:42:39.828]  Humanity is going through a crisis.
[02:42:39.828 --> 02:42:42.370]  Cancer rates in children are up 10,000 percent.
[02:42:42.370 --> 02:42:44.752]  Diabetes type 2 is up 3,000 percent.
[02:42:44.752 --> 02:42:45.532]  All these issues.
[02:42:45.532 --> 02:42:51.677]  We're in crisis together and instead of panicking and blaming each other, we need to really talk about it
[02:42:51.897 --> 02:42:59.963]  And again, I say this, your crime is you lovingly bring people together and unify us as humans to fix it.
[02:42:59.963 --> 02:43:02.966]  And there are people that want to exacerbate the problems.
[02:43:02.966 --> 02:43:03.967]  They don't want to fix it.
[02:43:03.967 --> 02:43:05.588]  They want crisis management.
[02:43:05.588 --> 02:43:06.889]  That's how they control people.
[02:43:06.889 --> 02:43:08.951]  But we're in a crisis.
[02:43:08.951 --> 02:43:10.432]  Let's recognize that.
[02:43:10.432 --> 02:43:16.216]  And the answer is celebrating women, celebrating men, celebrating families, and then loving anybody else.
[02:43:17.057 --> 02:43:18.619]  That wants to claim there's something else.
[02:43:18.619 --> 02:43:19.940]  That's part of creativity.
[02:43:19.940 --> 02:43:29.891]  But when it gets too extreme, it becomes a cancer that kills the original core of what we are as humanity goes through these changes.
[02:43:29.891 --> 02:43:30.352]  Go ahead, sorry.
[02:43:31.095 --> 02:43:44.730]  Yeah, I completely agree and I think it's really scary because they are trying to make an example of me that if you go off script and if you challenge the status quo in the way that I did with the red pill, you will be silenced, you will be smeared.
[02:43:44.730 --> 02:43:47.974]  But let me guess, let me guess, I bet you're selling more DVDs than ever.
[02:43:49.386 --> 02:44:05.583]  Well, that's the strange thing because even though apparently we have this gag order in the U.S., in May we were the top-selling movie on YouTube ahead of Guardians of the Galaxy, Moana, and Rogue One, the Star Wars film.
[02:44:05.583 --> 02:44:11.870]  You haven't seen this kind of success in sales from a documentary in a long time and yet the mainstream media won't touch it.
[02:44:12.090 --> 02:44:17.795]  Well, I've been talking to folks, highest levels of government, highest levels of banking, they want out of this new world order.
[02:44:17.795 --> 02:44:18.556]  And that's what they said.
[02:44:18.556 --> 02:44:21.599]  They said they recognize it's an illusion.
[02:44:21.599 --> 02:44:23.461]  This bullying is all an illusion.
[02:44:23.461 --> 02:44:28.766]  Nobody launched a boycott of Starbucks when they said they were going to hire a bunch of Islamic refugees.
[02:44:28.766 --> 02:44:31.028]  Everyone just spontaneously did it.
[02:44:32.233 --> 02:44:48.303]  I mean, I knew your film was a hit, but I didn't know, almost outdoing Rogue One, which by the way is a great film, I love seeing a powerful woman in that role, it's a great movie, but it's about men and women together in victory, and even I see Hollywood starting to now get away from this total feminist narrative.
[02:44:48.303 --> 02:44:52.086]  I love seeing Wonder Woman, I love seeing women in power, just don't make it at the expense of men.
[02:44:53.826 --> 02:44:55.486]  Yeah, I agree.
[02:44:55.486 --> 02:45:03.728]  And currently, this week, we are the top-selling film in Australia on YouTube, as well as Google Play for documentaries.
[02:45:03.728 --> 02:45:14.030]  I was just in Australia for about two weeks doing a screening, a press tour there, and they have a big hill to climb over there regarding gender politics.
[02:45:14.030 --> 02:45:16.531]  Why don't they get the Streisand effect?
[02:45:16.531 --> 02:45:18.451]  I mean, you know about the Streisand effect.
[02:45:18.451 --> 02:45:20.592]  Oh yes, it's worked very well in my favor.
[02:45:22.697 --> 02:45:24.057]  I mean, just look at where I'm at.
[02:45:24.057 --> 02:45:28.018]  And now the articles are, oh, I'm bashing Megyn Kelly because she's a woman.
[02:45:28.018 --> 02:45:28.598]  No.
[02:45:28.598 --> 02:45:30.199]  Nobody in media ever lied to me.
[02:45:30.199 --> 02:45:32.159]  They sent the Nightline, like her.
[02:45:32.159 --> 02:45:34.480]  The Nightline guy said, I'm doing a hard interview.
[02:45:34.480 --> 02:45:35.600]  I'm coming after you.
[02:45:35.600 --> 02:45:37.380]  And he did hit me on some real points.
[02:45:37.380 --> 02:45:39.761]  But it's a real, he's a real journalist.
[02:45:39.761 --> 02:45:41.261]  With her, it was just all lies.
[02:45:41.261 --> 02:45:42.481]  It's not that she's a woman.
[02:45:42.481 --> 02:45:43.201]  She's a liar!
[02:45:43.201 --> 02:45:50.223]  Well, I am looking forward to seeing her edit as well as your unedited interview.
[02:45:51.030 --> 02:45:57.897]  Well, ours is just the audio, but I mean, it was just like, I mean, I knew I was in, that she was lying when I was like, I believe Sandy Hook happened.
[02:45:57.897 --> 02:46:02.482]  And then like two months later, why are you saying the parents lied about their dead kids?
[02:46:02.482 --> 02:46:04.504]  And I went, Megan, I just told you my answer.
[02:46:04.504 --> 02:46:06.787]  No, you're saying gays deserve to be killed.
[02:46:06.787 --> 02:46:11.552]  I mean, it was just like, I was just like, whoa, I was like, I don't know what she's going to put out, but it was like, whoa.
[02:46:13.084 --> 02:46:16.287]  You know, that's why I love new media like your show.
[02:46:16.287 --> 02:46:25.233]  I was also on Dave Rubin and Stefan Molyneux and Stephen Crowder because you do live stream, live interviews and edited interviews on mainstream media.
[02:46:25.233 --> 02:46:26.634]  That's what you have to watch out for.
[02:46:26.634 --> 02:46:31.378]  And that's how I was smeared and slandered in Australia was on the show called The Project.
[02:46:31.378 --> 02:46:36.722]  I had over a 15 minute interview and they edited it down to five minutes and completely
[02:46:37.362 --> 02:46:47.346]  You know, took out all of my responses to the lies about the film and in their edited intro of my film they include these lies about the film, about how it was funded or how many people I interviewed.
[02:46:47.346 --> 02:46:48.467]  Well, here's one of their favorite tactics.
[02:46:48.467 --> 02:46:56.110]  They get you in a house with this 90 degrees, you're sweating, Megan's back there, light on her perfect, light under me, and then they go, let's take a break.
[02:46:56.110 --> 02:46:56.390]  And then...
[02:46:57.543 --> 02:47:03.806]  I see them focusing the camera while I'm mopping my brow to make it look like I'm nervous and got up from the interview.
[02:47:03.806 --> 02:47:12.569]  I'm expecting that they're going to claim I got up from the interview because I saw them like thumbs upping when I went to the bathroom and like was mopping my head and they were like focusing and I just knew what they were going to do.
[02:47:12.569 --> 02:47:13.750]  I mean it's so ridiculous.
[02:47:15.393 --> 02:47:16.894]  See, you know, and I'm an editor.
[02:47:16.894 --> 02:47:27.358]  I edited the full Red Pill film and that's so upsetting to hear how editors and mainstream shows use editing to manipulate the public.
[02:47:27.358 --> 02:47:32.880]  It's very easy to do and, you know, it comes down to the ethics in journalism.
[02:47:32.880 --> 02:47:35.101]  We don't do that because I'm not going to sink their level.
[02:47:35.101 --> 02:47:40.223]  I mean, whenever we have people on that at the disagreement that make a good point, I show it because that's who we are.
[02:47:40.223 --> 02:47:41.403]  It's not like we're even perfect.
[02:47:41.403 --> 02:47:43.884]  I couldn't get in the mindset of like deceiving people.
[02:47:45.031 --> 02:47:46.052]  Yeah.
[02:47:46.052 --> 02:47:48.856]  But that's what's great about the discipline of being live, like you just said.
[02:47:48.856 --> 02:47:52.440]  Being live three, four hours a day, five hours a day, it's like a discipline.
[02:47:52.440 --> 02:47:56.005]  Your brain works quicker, you know, you just get this instinct to tell the truth.
[02:47:57.247 --> 02:47:58.709]  Yeah.
[02:47:58.709 --> 02:48:12.443]  And, you know, people who do tell the truth don't need to rely on editing because everything you say, you know, as long as you tap into your own truth and memory of how things happen, how events happen, then you don't have to, you know, oh, well, that's not correct.
[02:48:12.443 --> 02:48:13.604]  That came out wrong.
[02:48:13.604 --> 02:48:14.646]  You don't have to edit it out.
[02:48:15.086 --> 02:48:29.932]  Well that's the thing is, I'm not arrogant, I'm the opposite because I've been so blessed in my life and half the time I came to listen to my own show, and I'm just being honest, but like Nico, I hired Nico immediately, he's got a great record as a head producer, but also he said, now I think your voice is kind of annoying and I disagree with a lot of what you say, but I think overall the message, I was like, well you're hired.
[02:48:29.932 --> 02:48:37.135]  I'm sick of yes man, he's been the best producer we ever had, but it's true, I mean I see myself as annoying, but the heart is there and the fact that
[02:48:38.015 --> 02:48:44.380]  The fact that, you know, I go into this stuff with like a child's heart about things and don't try to calculate.
[02:48:44.380 --> 02:48:47.723]  They now have the CIA and everybody else thinking I'm like the master calculator.
[02:48:47.723 --> 02:48:49.865]  It's all over the news, but it's not that.
[02:48:49.865 --> 02:48:54.869]  It's approaching life like just a normal person with your, like the greatest thing Trump ever said was,
[02:48:55.589 --> 02:49:02.675]  You know, I used to think about things to be too complex, but as soon as I became shallow and went with my instinct, it was the greatest moment of my life because it was so complex.
[02:49:02.675 --> 02:49:03.576]  They said, that doesn't make sense.
[02:49:03.576 --> 02:49:04.277]  No, it's true.
[02:49:04.277 --> 02:49:14.125]  We're so powerful, our first gut approximation with a database of knowledge is generally way better than trying to overthink stuff, is what I'm saying.
[02:49:14.125 --> 02:49:14.906]  Yeah.
[02:49:14.906 --> 02:49:17.068]  It's like woman's intuition.
[02:49:17.068 --> 02:49:17.248]  Yeah.
[02:49:18.288 --> 02:49:21.569]  About women that pick the men that build the civilization together.
[02:49:21.569 --> 02:49:23.450]  Without women's intuition, we're destroyed.
[02:49:23.450 --> 02:49:25.230]  So why is 80% of marketing targeting women?
[02:49:25.230 --> 02:49:26.291]  Because women are already king.
[02:49:26.291 --> 02:49:32.053]  Of course, your film lays that out.
[02:49:32.053 --> 02:49:34.153]  That's why they hate it.
[02:49:34.153 --> 02:49:36.254]  Yeah, I guess so.
[02:49:36.254 --> 02:49:42.676]  You know, feminism really does have just the blinders on tunnel vision that they only want to look at how women are disadvantaged and men are privileged.
[02:49:42.676 --> 02:49:45.217]  But there is the flip side as well, and I think they need to look at that.
[02:49:47.467 --> 02:49:50.210]  Men are privileged to die six years earlier on average.
[02:49:50.210 --> 02:49:54.374]  Like you said, 90% of the workplace deaths are men.
[02:49:54.374 --> 02:49:57.578]  It's expected of men to expend themselves.
[02:49:57.578 --> 02:49:58.398]  These men are expendable.
[02:50:00.453 --> 02:50:08.258]  And you know, so in the Red Pill, we do talk about male disposability, including war deaths, workplace deaths, suicide rates.
[02:50:08.258 --> 02:50:11.640]  Across the world, that's about 80% of all suicides are men.
[02:50:11.640 --> 02:50:13.522]  Every country.
[02:50:13.522 --> 02:50:16.543]  And shorter life expectancy, all these things.
[02:50:16.543 --> 02:50:19.846]  But what the men's rights activists are saying, they're not trying to say, you know,
[02:50:20.886 --> 02:50:23.709]  50% of women should die in military deaths.
[02:50:23.709 --> 02:50:29.054]  They're not trying to say that, but what they are saying is that we need to look at the big picture regarding gender.
[02:50:29.054 --> 02:50:33.197]  Both genders make sacrifices, especially when it's a family unit.
[02:50:33.197 --> 02:50:35.840]  Obviously, a stay-at-home mom is going to make a lot of sacrifices as well.
[02:50:36.843 --> 02:50:40.807]  Yeah, as well as the father who's going outside the home to provide for the family.
[02:50:40.807 --> 02:50:41.908]  To work on electrical lines.
[02:50:41.908 --> 02:50:43.289]  And again, we're one species.
[02:50:43.289 --> 02:50:45.170]  It's so obvious, but no one says it.
[02:50:45.170 --> 02:50:46.832]  We're the species!
[02:50:46.832 --> 02:50:50.055]  Again, we don't look at, like, dogs and say, that's male, that's female.
[02:50:50.055 --> 02:50:51.056]  They're fighting with each other.
[02:50:51.056 --> 02:50:51.796]  It's the species.
[02:50:51.796 --> 02:50:53.458]  It's what we developed into.
[02:50:53.458 --> 02:50:54.859]  We'll be back with our amazing guest.
[02:50:54.859 --> 02:50:56.941]  The film is TheRedPillMovie.com.

[02:51:30.547 --> 02:51:35.328]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water.
[02:51:35.328 --> 02:51:41.210]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way.

[02:52:02.062 --> 02:52:14.452]  I've spent seven years off and on trying to get a big national brand that's already trusted to let us private label an entire line of personal care products that's organic, high quality.
[02:52:14.452 --> 02:52:19.476]  This is one of the top three selling organic brands in the country.
[02:52:19.656 --> 02:52:23.540]  That puts out high-quality organic shampoo, mouthwash, you name it.
[02:52:23.540 --> 02:52:28.164]  And they're such patriots, they have let us basically keep their well-known packaging.
[02:52:28.164 --> 02:52:35.270]  It is an answer to prayer, and because we're cutting out the middleman, 20% off retail, sign up for auto-ship, an additional 25% off.
[02:52:35.270 --> 02:52:36.411]  It's all there.
[02:52:36.411 --> 02:52:37.112]  The Body Wash.
[02:52:37.372 --> 02:52:41.814]  The shampoo, the deodorant, the mouthwash, all of it is truly game-changing.

[02:54:10.557 --> 02:54:12.259]  Cassie J. TheRedPillMovie.com.
[02:54:12.259 --> 02:54:13.680]  Get it on Amazon, wherever.
[02:54:13.680 --> 02:54:14.721]  But don't go to Amazon.
[02:54:14.721 --> 02:54:17.464]  Bezos is funding the Globalist.
[02:54:17.464 --> 02:54:20.326]  $600 million to bring down Trump from the CIA.
[02:54:20.326 --> 02:54:21.948]  Go get it from RedPillMovie.com.
[02:54:21.948 --> 02:54:26.031]  That way, it might cost a dollar more or whatever because Amazon undercuts everybody.
[02:54:26.031 --> 02:54:27.373]  I mean, they're bigger than Walmart now.
[02:54:27.373 --> 02:54:28.294]  They're more cancerous.
[02:54:29.374 --> 02:54:31.135]  I mean, it's so evil, it's eating Walmart.
[02:54:31.135 --> 02:54:34.036]  So, more and more, I think I'm going to stop selling stuff on Amazon.
[02:54:34.036 --> 02:54:35.476]  I mean, because it's time to boycott.
[02:54:35.476 --> 02:54:37.817]  It's time to support folks who are promoting free speech.
[02:54:37.817 --> 02:54:38.497]  Get the film today.
[02:54:38.497 --> 02:54:39.938]  I'm going to call Cernovich, or whoever I call.
[02:54:39.938 --> 02:54:42.038]  I'm going to order 10,000 of this film.
[02:54:42.038 --> 02:54:43.179]  This is the film I want to promote.
[02:54:43.179 --> 02:54:44.139]  I want to push this film.
[02:54:44.139 --> 02:54:50.721]  I want to thank Anthony Gucciardi and others for recommending me to see the film a few weeks ago, and then I'd forgotten about it.
[02:54:50.721 --> 02:54:53.902]  And then so much goes on, and then Nico's like, hey, she's on the show.
[02:54:53.902 --> 02:54:58.124]  So, Cassie J., in the last minute or two, other points you'd like to impart to folks?
[02:54:59.426 --> 02:55:06.710]  Oh, well, as you're talking about platforms, the only platform to decline the Red Pill movie is Netflix, which I think is very interesting.
[02:55:06.710 --> 02:55:14.455]  But you can find us on all other platforms, including Hulu, iTunes, YouTube, Google Play, Vudu, Apple TV, everywhere.
[02:55:14.455 --> 02:55:17.477]  So, yeah, Netflix did decline the film.
[02:55:18.277 --> 02:55:25.450]  And notice they force-fed Amy Schumer that got half a star, so they got rid of the star system on things they know people are sick of.
[02:55:25.450 --> 02:55:30.178]  I mean, Amy Schumer, they're trying to make the new sex symbol who's anti-male, anti-female.
[02:55:32.856 --> 02:55:43.925]  Yeah, you know, that's part of the hypocrisy I see in feminism, is that if they were truly about supporting women, then why have they worked so hard to silence me in my film?
[02:55:43.925 --> 02:55:48.469]  I actually won a Women in Film Award for the Red Pill movie in Hollywood a couple weeks ago.
[02:55:48.469 --> 02:55:51.772]  Mike Cernovich was there with me to accept the award.
[02:55:51.772 --> 02:56:00.639]  And so I know that there are women out there, and feminist women, who do see the film as being valuable to the discussion of gender equality.
[02:56:01.660 --> 02:56:05.685]  But, you know, the radical ones and the extremists are trying to silence it.
[02:56:05.685 --> 02:56:11.011]  Well, I got three daughters and I want total gender equality and just God bless you for what you're doing.
[02:56:11.011 --> 02:56:14.496]  Congratulations on the film and your success in Swimming Upstream.
[02:56:14.496 --> 02:56:15.257]  Thank you so much.
[02:56:15.879 --> 02:56:17.060]  Beautiful, true trailblazer.
[02:56:17.060 --> 02:56:20.221]  They fear women so much, when women realize they're running the show.
[02:56:20.221 --> 02:56:22.022]  That's not patronizing, it's true.
[02:56:22.022 --> 02:56:30.025]  When they get behind men, and men get behind them, and you're on a team, you realize the globalist, these artificial systems, like Islam, are trying to enslave that.
[02:56:30.025 --> 02:56:32.426]  When you do that, it is unstoppable.
[02:56:32.426 --> 02:56:41.390]  And so many other people, who are talk show hosts, can't launch other networks, because, you know, there's a talented Mike Cernovich, you know, other, I mean, to be honest, a lot of men are just hyper-aggressive.
[02:56:41.390 --> 02:56:42.591]  They don't get we're all in this together.
[02:56:43.531 --> 02:56:45.732]  I hope Mike Cernovich becomes more successful than I am.
[02:56:45.732 --> 02:56:51.973]  He already, in the aggregate, just in the time he's been political with three years, is a successful or more.
[02:56:51.973 --> 02:56:53.054]  I'm looking for leaders.
[02:56:53.054 --> 02:56:57.095]  I'm looking, if somebody's better than me, I'll put them on air and just turn everything over.
[02:56:57.095 --> 02:56:58.315]  This is a war, folks.
[02:56:58.315 --> 02:57:00.075]  I'm looking to win.
[02:57:00.075 --> 02:57:02.636]  And that's why we need your financial support.
[02:57:02.636 --> 02:57:04.937]  Our audience has never been bigger.
[02:57:04.937 --> 02:57:09.238]  Our funding is at the same level it was this time last year, and that's just not acceptable.
[02:57:10.379 --> 02:57:14.823]  Because I want to open bureaus in London, in L.A., in New York.
[02:57:14.823 --> 02:57:16.584]  I already started it in D.C.
[02:57:16.584 --> 02:57:17.966]  I want to hire like 50 people.
[02:57:17.966 --> 02:57:22.810]  I want to, quite frankly, I was talking to Senator Rich last night, I want to put him in charge of new media.
[02:57:22.810 --> 02:57:24.051]  I just want to hire everybody.
[02:57:24.051 --> 02:57:25.332]  I need plane tickets.
[02:57:25.332 --> 02:57:25.692]  I need money.
[02:57:25.692 --> 02:57:26.053]  I need money.
[02:57:27.994 --> 02:57:29.675]  Believe me, I'm looking to get in a smaller house.
[02:57:29.675 --> 02:57:32.476]  It isn't about stupid crap.
[02:57:32.476 --> 02:57:34.697]  You know, I've got these two blue jackets I've been wearing for six years.
[02:57:34.697 --> 02:57:35.538]  I'm starting to get holes in them.
[02:57:35.538 --> 02:57:36.738]  I'm going to buy new ones.
[02:57:36.738 --> 02:57:38.939]  The point is, is that I want to win.
[02:57:38.939 --> 02:57:40.360]  I want to dominate the globalists.
[02:57:40.360 --> 02:57:42.961]  I want to tear their arms out of their sockets politically.
[02:57:42.961 --> 02:57:45.342]  You know, Grendel comes to attack us while we sleep?
[02:57:45.342 --> 02:57:47.723]  Grendel's going to go home to mommy bleeding to death politically.
[02:57:47.723 --> 02:57:49.344]  They want to run around and say they're going to murder us all?
[02:57:49.344 --> 02:57:52.165]  I want to murder them financially, politically.
[02:57:52.165 --> 02:57:54.866]  We've got products that'll blow your socks off.
[02:57:54.866 --> 02:57:55.627]  It'll change your life.

[02:58:04.158 --> 02:58:07.039]  I don't need an extra two, three million dollars to work with.
[02:58:07.039 --> 02:58:09.501]  That sounds like a lot if you're, you know, living by yourself with your wife.
[02:58:09.501 --> 02:58:10.481]  That's nothing.
[02:58:10.481 --> 02:58:14.024]  I need hundreds of millions of dollars and I can defeat them all with your help.
[02:58:14.804 --> 02:58:17.426]  But, hey, give me 10 million extra, I'll go to the next level.

[02:58:19.267 --> 02:58:20.328]  We're moving forward.

[02:58:22.089 --> 02:58:26.171]  We've got the mojo, folks, because of God and your prayers.
[02:58:26.171 --> 02:58:27.892]  So most importantly, pray for Infowars.
[02:58:27.892 --> 02:58:29.433]  Most importantly, thank you for all you've done.
[02:58:29.433 --> 02:58:30.454]  And no, I'm humble.
[02:58:30.454 --> 02:58:31.635]  And I'm doing as best I can.
[02:58:31.635 --> 02:58:33.136]  Lord knows I've got problems.
[02:58:33.136 --> 02:58:34.196]  But I'm committed.
[02:58:34.196 --> 02:58:36.118]  And I need your financial support at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:58:36.618 --> 02:58:37.379]  Commit today.

[02:58:39.040 --> 02:58:41.542]  More on Megyn Kelly and more straight ahead.
[02:58:41.542 --> 02:58:43.343]  This is the InfoWar.

[02:58:48.047 --> 02:58:48.687]  They're in a war.
[02:58:48.687 --> 02:58:49.288]  We're going to defeat them.
[02:58:51.354 --> 02:58:52.775]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[02:58:52.775 --> 02:58:54.095]  It took you over a year to do it.
[02:58:54.095 --> 02:58:55.316]  Why is this so good?
[02:58:55.316 --> 02:59:00.598]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[02:59:00.598 --> 02:59:14.143]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[02:59:14.143 --> 02:59:15.504]  Right now with all the refugees,
[02:59:16.424 --> 02:59:17.925]  Spreading disease around.
[02:59:17.925 --> 02:59:20.506]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[02:59:20.506 --> 02:59:21.807]  These are all parasites.
[02:59:21.807 --> 02:59:22.908]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[02:59:22.908 --> 02:59:24.248]  There's so many things that are in it.
[02:59:24.248 --> 02:59:28.751]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[02:59:28.751 --> 02:59:31.912]  I recommend doing the parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[02:59:31.912 --> 02:59:35.094]  Alright, well I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[02:59:35.094 --> 02:59:36.135]  It just came back in yesterday.
[02:59:36.135 --> 02:59:38.056]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[02:59:38.056 --> 02:59:39.096]  And folks, you can't lose.
[02:59:39.096 --> 02:59:41.117]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[02:59:42.678 --> 02:59:43.698]  You support the broadcast.
[02:59:43.698 --> 02:59:45.038]  Infowarslives.com.
[02:59:45.038 --> 02:59:47.299]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[02:59:47.299 --> 02:59:53.380]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[02:59:53.380 --> 03:00:08.443]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:08.443 --> 03:00:09.483]  Brings tears to my eyes.
[03:00:10.800 --> 03:00:14.901]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[03:00:14.901 --> 03:00:18.741]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:18.741 --> 03:00:30.743]  You know, I don't say this to be patronizing, but when I'm down, when I'm under attack, when I need the strength of my ancestors, I think about the women in my life, those who have come, those who have gone, my dead grandmothers.
[03:00:30.743 --> 03:00:35.884]  I think of one person in particular, my father's mother, who died about 13 years ago.
[03:00:35.884 --> 03:00:39.265]  And she was hard on me, she wanted me to be good, she wanted me to be strong.
[03:00:40.283 --> 03:00:42.045]  And, you know, I got in arguments with her and stuff.
[03:00:42.045 --> 03:00:48.011]  I even didn't see her for five years when I was a young man because I was mad at her for confronting me about things.
[03:00:48.011 --> 03:00:50.193]  But my dad's mom was so strong.
[03:00:50.193 --> 03:00:56.319]  I've never seen any woman with... cat-electricity in her eyes.
[03:00:58.973 --> 03:01:01.334]  I think about how they've driven wedges between men and women.
[03:01:01.334 --> 03:01:03.154]  It's so satanic.
[03:01:03.154 --> 03:01:11.097]  And women that have sons and fathers that have daughters, you know what a joke this whole sexist thing is.
[03:01:11.097 --> 03:01:11.858]  It's all a fraud.
[03:01:11.858 --> 03:01:16.619]  We are humanity and we stand against the globalists and whatever it is, it's anti-human.
[03:01:16.619 --> 03:01:18.420]  The Bible says it's a fallen entity.
[03:01:19.605 --> 03:01:20.766]  Not of this world.
[03:01:20.766 --> 03:01:21.948]  And it acts just like that.
[03:01:21.948 --> 03:01:24.671]  So whether you believe in the Bible or not, we're fighting Satanism.
[03:01:24.671 --> 03:01:26.753]  We're fighting people that want to kill us.
[03:01:26.753 --> 03:01:31.218]  And our strong men are a reflection of the women.
[03:01:31.218 --> 03:01:32.579]  And women need to know that.
[03:01:32.579 --> 03:01:38.225]  And men need to start acting like men and stop treating women like crap and be honorable.
[03:01:38.225 --> 03:01:40.328]  Mike Cernovich, tell us what you got coming up today, my friend.
[03:01:41.489 --> 03:02:04.435]  Well, you know, it's odd that you mention that because the closest person in my life was actually my grandmother and probably one of the saddest things in my life that happened to me was I had a really bad medical condition that hit me and I wasn't able to travel to her funeral and she was this very strong woman in our life and, you know, watching her fall into dementia and stuff and you realize
[03:02:05.035 --> 03:02:07.596]  You know, like what you were saying, it is an attack on the women.
[03:02:07.596 --> 03:02:09.897]  My grandmother lived in the Great Depression.
[03:02:09.897 --> 03:02:10.938]  She worked a job.
[03:02:10.938 --> 03:02:15.760]  We hear all this nonsense in the feminist media all about women at work.
[03:02:15.760 --> 03:02:19.582]  My grandma worked, you know, through the Depression, through World War II.
[03:02:20.482 --> 03:02:22.545]  Throughout the years.
[03:02:22.545 --> 03:02:25.388]  Women always worked when they had to.
[03:02:25.388 --> 03:02:27.991]  And they want men and women, they want them hating each other.
[03:02:27.991 --> 03:02:37.182]  That's why when you had Cassie J on, a lot of people don't know because I don't brag about this stuff, but her film was being censored by the globalist elite.
[03:02:37.182 --> 03:02:39.085]  And you and your supporters helped force it out.
[03:02:40.168 --> 03:02:46.135]  So I said, I will match $10,000 for my readers and I will kickstart it with $10,000.
[03:02:46.135 --> 03:02:53.023]  So we did a big kickstarter and that was what helped jumpstart her and get the film made because it's a powerful message.
[03:02:53.023 --> 03:02:54.445]  But the media will never tell you that.
[03:02:54.445 --> 03:02:57.128]  They'll just say, oh Sternovich is a misogynist, hates women.
[03:02:57.128 --> 03:03:00.312]  They'll never say that I did everything I could to help fund, promote,
[03:03:00.932 --> 03:03:12.802]  A feminist, a female's movie that won an award for women in films and that's why the news is fake and that's why we have to fight so hard every day to attack these people because they truly are sinister forces.
[03:03:12.802 --> 03:03:24.351]  Well there's no doubt they're attacking women first and foremost with 80% of their propaganda is admittedly focused on them and it's just so dastardly and then how the very enemies of women are the ones claiming to represent them.
[03:03:24.351 --> 03:03:25.192]  It's pure satanism.
[03:03:26.929 --> 03:03:32.075]  Well, women are the most unhappy that they've ever been in American history.
[03:03:32.075 --> 03:03:34.217]  One in four women are on antidepressants.
[03:03:34.217 --> 03:03:35.359]  You can look this up.
[03:03:35.359 --> 03:03:38.582]  So the women are actually the most unhappy that they've ever been.
[03:03:38.582 --> 03:03:39.463]  Men are unhappy.
[03:03:39.463 --> 03:03:41.025]  Everybody's at each other's throats.
[03:03:41.025 --> 03:03:42.547]  Everybody's trying to play the victim.
[03:03:43.388 --> 03:03:49.835]  And it is very sad, and once you recognize that that is a globalist plot to destroy the family unit, then it all makes sense.
[03:03:49.835 --> 03:03:54.900]  But that is again why, you know, the Cassie J, that film was 100% reader supported.
[03:03:54.900 --> 03:03:59.245]  And it's because it's so real, and her experience is why they fear it.
[03:04:00.555 --> 03:04:09.777]  Exactly right, and they're terrified now of men and women uniting, of the races uniting, and you can see that all the time.
[03:04:09.777 --> 03:04:18.339]  That's why they call us sexist, racist, homophobic, because they actually see that everybody's uniting around us, around patriotism, around truth, and around virtue and goodness.
[03:04:18.339 --> 03:04:20.539]  Humanity's bouncing back.
[03:04:20.539 --> 03:04:21.379]  Right, exactly.
[03:04:21.379 --> 03:04:23.620]  So people are definitely waking up.
[03:04:24.258 --> 03:04:26.861]  And for that reason, they're going after us even harder.
[03:04:26.861 --> 03:04:30.005]  I mean, that's why Megyn Kelly is attacking you on Father's Day.
[03:04:30.005 --> 03:04:31.767]  That is not an attack on you.
[03:04:31.767 --> 03:04:34.209]  You're just their pawn on the war against fathers.
[03:04:34.209 --> 03:04:36.212]  I'm glad you raised this, because I didn't want to take over this hour.
[03:04:36.212 --> 03:04:37.833]  But if you want to do five more minutes, I'll let you take over.
[03:04:37.833 --> 03:04:39.215]  And soon you'll have your own show.
[03:04:39.215 --> 03:04:40.376]  We're going to get launched next month.
[03:04:40.376 --> 03:04:41.738]  I'm getting it all hired right now.
[03:04:41.738 --> 03:04:42.479]  Great crew coming in.
[03:04:42.479 --> 03:04:43.380]  A lot of great people.
[03:04:44.060 --> 03:04:44.541]  I clicked.
[03:04:44.541 --> 03:04:45.462]  They said it was in July.
[03:04:45.462 --> 03:04:47.665]  Then they said Father's Day and I remembered the questions.
[03:04:47.665 --> 03:04:52.312]  They're saying I'm doing this on Father's Day to demonize the image of men.
[03:04:52.312 --> 03:04:53.454]  This is so sick.
[03:04:53.454 --> 03:04:55.336]  I want to get Mike Cernovich's take on that.
[03:04:55.336 --> 03:04:56.818]  He's hosting this hour.
[03:04:56.818 --> 03:04:57.419]  Stay with us.
[03:04:57.419 --> 03:04:58.961]  Infowars.com.
[03:05:00.882 --> 03:05:09.846]  Following the liberal outcry over Megyn Kelly interviewing Alex Jones, NBC News executives have been scrambling to further edit their hit piece on Alex Jones.
[03:05:09.846 --> 03:05:22.212]  The word now is that Megyn Kelly has changed her Sunday night show featuring Alex Jones' interview by inviting Sandy Hook families on to play edited clips of Alex talking while they have the parents emotionally respond.
[03:05:22.212 --> 03:05:28.555]  One thing is for sure with how long it's taking NBC to edit Megyn Kelly's interview with Alex Jones prior to just
[03:05:28.835 --> 03:05:29.195]  I think so.
[03:05:50.345 --> 03:06:07.254]  The reason InfoWars Live has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm gonna use for my family.
[03:06:07.254 --> 03:06:08.095]  I take this.
[03:06:08.095 --> 03:06:09.155]  My family takes this.
[03:06:09.155 --> 03:06:13.518]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're gonna find anywhere.
[03:06:13.518 --> 03:06:17.980]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[03:06:18.100 --> 03:06:22.742]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[03:06:22.742 --> 03:06:23.883]  I don't feel good.
[03:06:23.883 --> 03:06:27.625]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[03:06:27.625 --> 03:06:30.326]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[03:06:30.326 --> 03:06:36.129]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[03:06:36.129 --> 03:06:39.090]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[03:06:39.090 --> 03:06:42.512]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[03:06:42.512 --> 03:06:44.853]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[03:06:44.853 --> 03:06:45.213]  I love it.
[03:06:45.373 --> 03:06:48.175]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[03:06:48.175 --> 03:06:49.195]  Survival Shield X2.
[03:06:49.195 --> 03:06:55.019]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing, that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[03:06:55.019 --> 03:06:57.020]  It's got a five-star rating.
[03:06:57.020 --> 03:06:59.042]  It's a win-win in fullwarslife.com.
[03:07:00.783 --> 03:07:04.786]  A new shipment of BioTruth Selenium is now available at Infowarslife.com.
[03:07:04.786 --> 03:07:06.267]  We've been sold out for months.
[03:07:06.267 --> 03:07:11.331]  Our one-of-a-kind Infowarslife BioTruth Selenium formula is now back in stock at Infowarslife.com.
[03:07:11.331 --> 03:07:15.473]  This is the true selenium formula that has rocked the nutraceutical industry to its core.
[03:07:15.473 --> 03:07:20.017]  Nearly every other selenium supplement on the market is produced with synthetic selenium.
[03:07:20.017 --> 03:07:25.160]  But BioTruth Selenium is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seed.
[03:07:25.160 --> 03:07:27.642]  The effects of the essential trace mineral selenium
[03:07:27.722 --> 03:07:40.871]  From supporting the thyroid gland and immune system to DNA production and eyesight, BioTrue Selenium is also the perfect supercharger to Survival Shield X2 nascent iodine, as both help support a healthy thyroid and many other systems.
[03:07:40.871 --> 03:07:45.755]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com to order your bottle of BioTrue Selenium before we sell it again.
[03:07:45.755 --> 03:07:53.620]  That's InfoWarsLife.com to secure your selenium and other key products that don't only help yourself and your family, but also fund our operation against the globalists.
[03:07:53.620 --> 03:07:53.800]  A 360 win.
[03:07:54.821 --> 03:07:56.882]  We didn't ask for this fight, but we're in this fight.
[03:07:56.882 --> 03:07:58.382]  This is the time to support InfoWars.
[03:07:58.382 --> 03:08:14.826]  That's InfoWarsLive.com.
[03:08:14.826 --> 03:08:19.047]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:08:21.644 --> 03:08:24.106]  Mike Cernovich is hosting the broadcast.
[03:08:24.106 --> 03:08:26.628]  One of the top investigative journalists in the world.
[03:08:26.628 --> 03:08:28.809]  Giant scoops continually.
[03:08:28.809 --> 03:08:31.671]  He'll have some big scoops for us, obviously, next week, a little bird told me.
[03:08:31.671 --> 03:08:34.353]  I just want to war game with him because I really respect his opinion.
[03:08:34.353 --> 03:08:38.336]  Unfortunately, I can't even put into action one third of the great ideas he gives me on a daily basis.
[03:08:38.336 --> 03:08:40.298]  By the way, we're going to start playing the videos in the next few days.
[03:08:40.298 --> 03:08:41.238]  We're going to start giving attention.
[03:08:41.238 --> 03:08:42.519]  We've already sent out a few of the prizes.
[03:08:42.519 --> 03:08:45.261]  His idea, the CNN is a terrorist organization thing, $200,000.
[03:08:46.582 --> 03:08:50.563]  We've only sent out checks, I think, for like $6,000, $7,000.
[03:08:50.563 --> 03:08:56.904]  I think I need to hire like three people that are just in charge of contests, because I'm trying to watch these, and then I want to get videos, and then I want to air it.
[03:08:56.904 --> 03:08:58.425]  Know this, I appreciate you all.
[03:08:58.425 --> 03:08:59.145]  I'm blown away.
[03:08:59.145 --> 03:09:01.105]  I do not take you for granted.
[03:09:01.105 --> 03:09:03.526]  You know, we don't do auto-responses to emails.
[03:09:03.526 --> 03:09:09.587]  Then I'll have some nice lady walk over and say, I've sent you 20 emails and never got a response, but I got a response back from the governor.
[03:09:10.607 --> 03:09:11.769]  Listen, I'm not technical.
[03:09:11.769 --> 03:09:14.434]  I'm working 18 hours a day, and I just know this.
[03:09:14.434 --> 03:09:15.295]  I'm doing the best I can.
[03:09:15.295 --> 03:09:16.517]  I'm not complaining.
[03:09:16.517 --> 03:09:20.844]  I just feel bad as a guy that's in a Texas hospitality not appreciating you enough.
[03:09:20.844 --> 03:09:22.446]  And again, that's not a butt-kissing event.
[03:09:23.702 --> 03:09:25.444]  You are so amazing.
[03:09:25.444 --> 03:09:30.268]  I mean, I don't care if it's a black man or a black woman or an Asian lady or most people are mixed.
[03:09:30.268 --> 03:09:31.950]  I'm part Native American.
[03:09:31.950 --> 03:09:37.515]  The light in the eyes of the black people, particularly grab my hand at grocery stores or on the street.
[03:09:37.515 --> 03:09:40.477]  I mean, it's like they're so alive beyond.
[03:09:40.477 --> 03:09:41.718]  It's just amazing.
[03:09:41.718 --> 03:09:44.120]  And then you see liberal black folks or white folks are like dead.
[03:09:45.322 --> 03:09:47.845]  Our Hispanic folks that are awake, I mean, they're just strong.
[03:09:47.845 --> 03:09:48.525]  They're focused.
[03:09:48.525 --> 03:09:49.146]  They know.
[03:09:49.146 --> 03:09:50.588]  They have a spirit.
[03:09:50.588 --> 03:09:51.429]  You connect.
[03:09:51.429 --> 03:09:52.670]  It's like you feel them.
[03:09:52.670 --> 03:09:53.131]  You see them.
[03:09:54.349 --> 03:09:57.590]  I don't like new agey type stuff, but you know, it's like in the movie Avatar where they go, I see you.
[03:09:57.590 --> 03:09:58.710]  You know, I see them.
[03:09:58.710 --> 03:10:01.972]  And you see people like Megyn Kelly, it was all gone.
[03:10:01.972 --> 03:10:02.472]  No humanity.
[03:10:02.472 --> 03:10:07.393]  And then she would turn on fake femininity, but it wasn't real and it was repulsive.
[03:10:07.393 --> 03:10:09.374]  I didn't say that to hurt her feelings.
[03:10:09.374 --> 03:10:13.856]  You know, if you want to see the text messages I've been getting from her, that's a whole other story I'm thinking about putting out.
[03:10:13.856 --> 03:10:19.177]  And I've got to clarify a bunch of things also about what I think she's going to claim because she's desperate right now.
[03:10:21.874 --> 03:10:24.057]  This is a great time to be alive.
[03:10:24.057 --> 03:10:32.227]  This is a great challenge because we're just doing the right thing and then as things arise we deal with it.
[03:10:32.227 --> 03:10:33.088]  We're not calculating.
[03:10:33.939 --> 03:10:36.982]  We just have upfront, straight-up ideas about the right thing.
[03:10:36.982 --> 03:10:38.503]  We don't think about what comes out of it.
[03:10:38.503 --> 03:10:45.129]  But then doing the right thing is actually the three-dimensional chess, because we're already designed like that to do the right thing, because it's the right thing.
[03:10:45.129 --> 03:10:49.233]  It's the right thing, because the brain is a hundred times more powerful, the subconscious, than the conscious.
[03:10:49.233 --> 03:10:53.237]  That first approximation isn't some off-the-top-of-the-head failure.
[03:10:53.237 --> 03:10:57.280]  It's everything, our ancestors, everything we've got on the line.
[03:11:01.327 --> 03:11:02.169]  I'm just so blessed.
[03:11:02.169 --> 03:11:03.791]  I mean, I am blessed.
[03:11:03.791 --> 03:11:08.616]  People said to me this week, they go, man, you're really putting a good face on the demonization, the attacks and all the stuff you've been through.
[03:11:08.616 --> 03:11:11.360]  Megyn Kelly even said that, wow, they try to take your kids away, all this stuff.
[03:11:11.360 --> 03:11:15.185]  And I said to her, I said, no, I mean it, that I would do all this over again the same way.
[03:11:15.185 --> 03:11:16.887]  This is the animating contest of liberty.
[03:11:16.887 --> 03:11:18.008]  I am so blessed.
[03:11:19.136 --> 03:11:22.059]  I mean, I am just ashamed that I'm not stronger or better.
[03:11:22.059 --> 03:11:24.061]  This is an honor.
[03:11:24.061 --> 03:11:26.623]  Wherever this goes, this is so fulfilling.
[03:11:26.623 --> 03:11:30.047]  It's like the greatest drug on earth, no drugs needed.
[03:11:30.047 --> 03:11:31.308]  This is being a man.
[03:11:31.308 --> 03:11:34.711]  This is not shaming my family name, my ancestors.
[03:11:34.711 --> 03:11:36.113]  That means it's continuing on.
[03:11:37.679 --> 03:11:41.722]  So, I don't know, should I release the full interview before she does, so she can't edit it?
[03:11:41.722 --> 03:11:44.284]  Do I wait until they release it to see what they did?
[03:11:44.284 --> 03:11:47.666]  Because I already know from the promo pieces and stuff they said it's a hit piece.
[03:11:47.666 --> 03:11:51.568]  Cernovich, you're a smart cookie, a lawyer, filmmaker, you name it.
[03:11:51.568 --> 03:11:54.530]  Give me advice in the next five minutes, so I'm going to get off here and let you host.
[03:11:54.530 --> 03:11:58.473]  It's rude of me taking over, even though I know you condone it.
[03:11:58.473 --> 03:12:00.014]  What do you think I should do?
[03:12:00.014 --> 03:12:01.475]  What do you make of all this?
[03:12:01.475 --> 03:12:02.396]  What wrinkles do you see?
[03:12:03.149 --> 03:12:09.052]  Yeah, so I actually, I'm introducing a new character called Professor Cernovich, and I'm going to explain the media strategy.
[03:12:09.052 --> 03:12:17.955]  But before we do that, I just want to say like, yeah, this is what people don't understand about you, me, and the other people, Paul Joseph Watson, Stefan Molyneux, the people who fight.
[03:12:17.955 --> 03:12:27.399]  I woke up today, my daughter got me up at 6.50 a.m., played with her, hiked, been, you know, working sources, been doing news, did a Periscope, doing a video with you.
[03:12:28.860 --> 03:12:33.541]  We can work 18 hours a day because we're not spiritually bankrupt like Megyn Kelly.
[03:12:33.541 --> 03:12:35.381]  Megyn Kelly thinks it's work.
[03:12:35.381 --> 03:12:44.163]  We wake up, like, to me, I just have to make it seem, I have to slow down because I look, you know, like a nutcase with so much energy and passion that it's becoming grounded.
[03:12:44.163 --> 03:12:49.544]  So, the strategy that for you is... That's it, you're grounded to humanity.
[03:12:49.544 --> 03:12:53.805]  Who would want to be cut off from that great fount of history and the struggles we've had together?
[03:12:54.904 --> 03:13:01.272]  Well, and that's why they want to teach people to not believe in any kind of God or spiritualism or religion.
[03:13:01.272 --> 03:13:05.337]  And, you know, black people, the Christian community is still very strong in that community.
[03:13:05.337 --> 03:13:07.740]  And that's why you can sense there's a lot of violence.
[03:13:07.740 --> 03:13:09.703]  That's why they've been targeted because they're so strong.
[03:13:10.919 --> 03:13:29.265]  And that's why they want to bankrupt them spiritually too, is ultimately the liberals want, they feel vacant and empty inside and rather than connect themselves to the totality of our collective human unconscious and collective human experience into the universe, they want everybody to be disconnected and dead inside like they are.
[03:13:29.265 --> 03:13:32.766]  That's why we call it a death cult for good reason.
[03:13:32.766 --> 03:13:33.866]  What do you think I should do with Kelly?
[03:13:35.029 --> 03:13:44.736]  Yeah, so what this has to do with Megyn Kelly is you are a... I don't want to call you a pawn, that sounds bad, but you're a move on the chessboard that's... No, no, I totally agree.
[03:13:44.736 --> 03:13:47.098]  I put myself into the gambit to be destroyed if need be.
[03:13:48.237 --> 03:13:49.038]  Exactly.
[03:13:49.038 --> 03:13:52.440]  They're putting you on the board to attack all fathers.
[03:13:52.440 --> 03:13:53.882]  They're going to say, look at this guy.
[03:13:53.882 --> 03:13:54.922]  He's a bad father.
[03:13:54.922 --> 03:13:56.304]  He's hurting fathers.
[03:13:56.304 --> 03:13:58.205]  American fathers are terrible.
[03:13:58.205 --> 03:13:59.326]  That's why they're airing it on fathers.
[03:13:59.326 --> 03:14:02.288]  Just like all the Super Bowl ads are anti-father everything.
[03:14:02.288 --> 03:14:02.829]  Exactly.
[03:14:02.829 --> 03:14:06.612]  And then they blame me that it's on Father's Day when they're the ones that did it.
[03:14:07.779 --> 03:14:10.260]  Yeah, that's how they set it up and how they cut it.
[03:14:10.260 --> 03:14:25.945]  So then on Father's Day, they can do a direct attack on fathers, and then you're victimizing fathers, and they want to unconsciously demean all fatherhood in America, and they want everybody, because they glorify the destruction and denigration of men and of fathers.
[03:14:25.945 --> 03:14:27.566]  So that's the big play here.
[03:14:27.566 --> 03:14:29.666]  And it was all premeditated.
[03:14:29.666 --> 03:14:31.347]  How did they think we wouldn't be aware of that?
[03:14:32.321 --> 03:14:34.482]  Well, and that's what, you know, I was going to do the whole show.
[03:14:34.482 --> 03:14:42.388]  That's why I'm glad you're joining me, because in the notes I sent to your, like, first class producers, Daria and Nico, you know, you have a Yankees, man.
[03:14:42.388 --> 03:14:45.410]  And it's like the Chicago Bulls in their prime.
[03:14:45.410 --> 03:14:49.893]  And, you know, everything that we're going to talk about is the media stuff and what they don't understand yet.
[03:14:49.893 --> 03:14:55.336]  You know, Charlie Wurzel, who wrote an article about it, he kind of gets some things and what they don't is what they don't understand.
[03:14:55.336 --> 03:14:56.397]  I saw the Wurzel story.
[03:14:56.397 --> 03:14:58.599]  He thinks I'm like master calculating.
[03:14:58.599 --> 03:15:02.121]  He doesn't get I'm just trying to do the right thing and praying to God.
[03:15:03.482 --> 03:15:10.611]  Well, what they don't really quite understand yet, though, is you're a filmmaker, you're an author, you're a journalist.
[03:15:10.611 --> 03:15:14.255]  We can cut things just like they can cut things.
[03:15:14.255 --> 03:15:14.896]  Exactly.
[03:15:14.896 --> 03:15:15.977]  We have our own outlet.
[03:15:15.977 --> 03:15:18.801]  It's not just the all-powerful MSM having their way anymore.
[03:15:19.696 --> 03:15:20.416]  Right, exactly.
[03:15:20.416 --> 03:15:27.340]  So they come in, and you think about it, if they do a hit piece on some guy, some, you know, regular good American, that person, what do you do?
[03:15:27.340 --> 03:15:29.001]  Write a letter to the editor.
[03:15:29.001 --> 03:15:34.925]  But really, more people watch your stuff, and our stuff, than watch these cable news segments.
[03:15:34.925 --> 03:15:40.048]  But they don't understand it, because, so we, I had HBO, HBO's actually planning a hit piece on me.
[03:15:40.048 --> 03:15:48.253]  They're doing a whole attack thing on me, and they came out of my house, and Shawna, this is the first time she really, she's met a lot of these people, and she was like, wow, what were they doing?
[03:15:48.253 --> 03:15:48.773]  And I go, well they,
[03:15:49.293 --> 03:15:55.539]  They were trying to discredit and demean me, and they would say things like, oh, well, you must think you're a big deal.
[03:15:55.539 --> 03:15:57.020]  Oh my, you must think you're important.
[03:15:57.020 --> 03:15:58.161]  Oh my, you think you're this or that.
[03:15:58.161 --> 03:15:59.783]  She did the same thing.
[03:15:59.783 --> 03:16:00.403]  Yeah.
[03:16:00.403 --> 03:16:11.534]  So the whole thing is to try to discredit independent media, because what they don't understand yet, and this is what Charlie and others don't understand yet, I turned down 90% of media.
[03:16:11.534 --> 03:16:12.495]  I don't need the media.
[03:16:13.410 --> 03:16:14.131]  To get my message out.
[03:16:14.131 --> 03:16:15.152]  You know, that's key.
[03:16:15.152 --> 03:16:17.714]  Because they're like, oh, giving you a platform.
[03:16:17.714 --> 03:16:19.996]  The show usually has five, six million viewers.
[03:16:19.996 --> 03:16:21.478]  They keep using the six million number for us.
[03:16:21.478 --> 03:16:22.639]  That's her numbers.
[03:16:22.639 --> 03:16:25.282]  We are really 45 million people a week, conservatively.
[03:16:25.282 --> 03:16:26.923]  You're reaching tens of millions.
[03:16:26.923 --> 03:16:31.007]  It's just crazy how they're acting like we need them and then they have the power.
[03:16:31.007 --> 03:16:32.609]  Will it air?
[03:16:32.609 --> 03:16:33.289]  It's just sick.
[03:16:34.301 --> 03:16:35.041]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:16:35.041 --> 03:16:38.884]  So when I went on 60 Minutes, they did 16 million viewers.
[03:16:38.884 --> 03:16:45.067]  They had never had ratings like that until 2008, when Barack and Michelle Obama did an initial interview.
[03:16:45.067 --> 03:16:48.349]  So I gave them, their only ratings went in a decade.
[03:16:48.349 --> 03:16:54.693]  I give them Obama level, when he was inaugurated, Obama and Michelle level ratings, and then they go, you're giving me a platform.
[03:16:54.693 --> 03:16:55.933]  I turn down these people.
[03:16:55.933 --> 03:16:59.195]  The only reason I do it is if it's a challenge, because I like it.
[03:16:59.195 --> 03:16:59.976]  Exactly.
[03:16:59.976 --> 03:17:00.776]  I knew they were planning
[03:17:00.796 --> 03:17:02.199]  I mean, God's got the knowledge.
[03:17:10.339 --> 03:17:14.301]  Well, and that's exactly right, because that's why people go, well, why did Alex agree to the interview?
[03:17:14.301 --> 03:17:17.483]  And I said, because you've got to understand it's a big challenge.
[03:17:17.483 --> 03:17:19.764]  You're going to go into the enemy territory.
[03:17:19.764 --> 03:17:22.525]  You know that the enemy is going to try and build and destroy you and ruin you.
[03:17:22.525 --> 03:17:23.706]  I'm going to let them wear me out.
[03:17:23.706 --> 03:17:24.767]  I'm going to let them do it all day.
[03:17:24.767 --> 03:17:26.347]  I'm going to let them wear me out.
[03:17:26.347 --> 03:17:30.930]  And I'm not doing the Christ analogy, but that we're all, you know, in the model of Christ.
[03:17:30.930 --> 03:17:33.351]  Out in the desert, then he'd let himself be tempted.
[03:17:33.351 --> 03:17:34.392]  Let them wear you out.
[03:17:34.392 --> 03:17:35.012]  Let them do it.
[03:17:35.012 --> 03:17:36.773]  I mean, that was the whole point, exactly.
[03:17:36.773 --> 03:17:38.554]  It's just, go into the lion's den.
[03:17:38.914 --> 03:17:41.383]  You know, see if God takes you out of it.
[03:17:41.383 --> 03:17:42.768]  Maybe it wasn't God's plan.
[03:17:42.768 --> 03:17:44.313]  Maybe I'm supposed to be destroyed this Sunday.
[03:17:45.560 --> 03:17:51.044]  Well, you're definitely not because the people are going to love you more because the people need champions, Alex.
[03:17:51.044 --> 03:17:53.085]  This is what people don't understand.
[03:17:53.085 --> 03:17:55.186]  This is what General Patton understood.
[03:17:55.186 --> 03:17:57.768]  And when Trump is on his game, this is what he understands.
[03:17:57.768 --> 03:18:01.631]  But Trump has been off his game for a little bit because he's getting bad advice.
[03:18:01.631 --> 03:18:03.732]  The people will hold you up.
[03:18:03.732 --> 03:18:06.794]  But you must also hold up the people of the servant leadership.
[03:18:06.794 --> 03:18:08.755]  We have no time for celebrities.
[03:18:08.755 --> 03:18:09.796]  We have to hold the people up.
[03:18:09.796 --> 03:18:11.197]  This isn't about celebrity.
[03:18:11.197 --> 03:18:11.697]  Exactly.
[03:18:11.697 --> 03:18:12.478]  It's a curse.
[03:18:12.478 --> 03:18:14.619]  And now America hates celebrity more and more.
[03:18:14.619 --> 03:18:15.280]  And they know that.
[03:18:16.921 --> 03:18:17.481]  Exactly.
[03:18:17.481 --> 03:18:21.382]  So the people are there for you because you're there for the people every day.
[03:18:21.382 --> 03:18:23.964]  Because they know that you'll walk into NBC.
[03:18:23.964 --> 03:18:25.764]  They know that you'll let them at you.
[03:18:25.764 --> 03:18:27.445]  They know that you're going to fight back.
[03:18:27.445 --> 03:18:33.047]  They know you're not going to be like these GOP cucks who, oh my God, I'm sorry.
[03:18:33.047 --> 03:18:35.028]  I wish I hadn't said that.
[03:18:35.028 --> 03:18:41.111]  I was, oh, beg me, you know, like they repent before the false God and pray before the false author.
[03:18:41.111 --> 03:18:42.111]  And that's what the people want.
[03:18:42.111 --> 03:18:43.031]  And that's what the people respect.
[03:18:44.667 --> 03:18:48.088]  I don't say this to sound fancy or anything, but it's really true.
[03:18:48.088 --> 03:18:55.710]  That the more you get attacked, like in the ether, and the more they persecute you, the discernment increases so much where I can't even handle it.
[03:18:55.710 --> 03:18:57.651]  It's actually scary.
[03:18:57.651 --> 03:18:59.371]  I just can't believe people that serve evil.
[03:18:59.371 --> 03:19:00.832]  They have no idea what they're missing out on.
[03:19:02.452 --> 03:19:03.973]  Well, it plugs me into the energy.
[03:19:03.973 --> 03:19:06.354]  I mean, for me, I have infinite energy.
[03:19:06.354 --> 03:19:18.439]  I have to pretend right now, all of my willpower is actually being concentrated that I just don't explode into like a big ball of fire or ether or something because I thought about what they're doing to you.
[03:19:19.159 --> 03:19:21.240]  And it's been, I've been so happy every day.
[03:19:21.240 --> 03:19:29.583]  I love watching them do this to you because I know that that is creating, because remember that their dark energy is going to create light energy.
[03:19:29.583 --> 03:19:32.824]  There's always life polarity, men and women, good and evil.
[03:19:32.824 --> 03:19:36.406]  So the more evil that they unleash in the world, the more goodness comes.
[03:19:37.895 --> 03:19:39.716]  That's what Putin said in his Megyn Kelly interview.
[03:19:39.716 --> 03:19:42.378]  He said, for every action there's an opposite and equal reaction.
[03:19:42.378 --> 03:19:48.441]  They don't understand the more they spew at us, the stronger we get if we just don't buy the illusion that they're beating us.
[03:19:48.441 --> 03:19:49.802]  Because we know what we really said.
[03:19:49.802 --> 03:19:51.423]  You know, I took my daughter to the dentist.
[03:19:52.287 --> 03:19:56.691]  To have a tooth removed because one of the babies he didn't come out had a long root.
[03:19:56.691 --> 03:19:59.474]  The point was she went to have it removed and I went to go with it.
[03:19:59.474 --> 03:20:05.280]  And the lady at the counter when I was paying, she sees the card and jolts.
[03:20:05.280 --> 03:20:07.843]  The older lady goes, and then I watched her being nice.
[03:20:07.843 --> 03:20:09.604]  Other people kind of rude to me.
[03:20:09.604 --> 03:20:11.406]  And I just, I didn't really even hold my head high.
[03:20:11.406 --> 03:20:12.667]  I just thought, you know, she's a victim.
[03:20:12.667 --> 03:20:13.268]  She's dumbed down.
[03:20:13.268 --> 03:20:13.708]  It's okay.
[03:20:14.571 --> 03:20:26.756]  And then later I saw her looking at me and then smiling and kind of shaking her head and then going through a process that she realized, hey, I bet that stuff I heard, I can even tell what she was thinking, I bet that stuff I heard wasn't true.
[03:20:26.756 --> 03:20:29.617]  And so I went even further while they were doing the procedure.
[03:20:29.617 --> 03:20:31.938]  I walked over to her and I said,
[03:20:33.058 --> 03:20:33.719]  You've been watching the news?
[03:20:33.719 --> 03:20:34.799]  She goes, yeah, I know who you are.
[03:20:34.799 --> 03:20:42.805]  I saw what they said, but it kind of jolted me when I was thinking about it, but then I kind of remembered the media lies so much, and I knew her process.
[03:20:42.805 --> 03:20:47.949]  I walked over and I heard the process and saw the humanity come back in her eyes.
[03:20:47.949 --> 03:20:49.551]  It was amazing.
[03:20:49.551 --> 03:20:54.494]  So it doesn't bother me to have people hate me because they're believing the lie the enemy told.
[03:20:54.494 --> 03:20:55.055]  That's not me.
[03:20:56.394 --> 03:21:03.057]  Well, they're hypnotized and you have to believe it's our job to be a form of evangelicals of truth.
[03:21:03.057 --> 03:21:10.800]  And so I pity people who hate me because I realize that they're cast under a spell, a very dark spell, a black magic spell.
[03:21:10.800 --> 03:21:15.422]  And when people hate me, for me, that's an opportunity for me to reawaken them.
[03:21:15.422 --> 03:21:18.263]  That's the enemy inside trying to keep them away from us.
[03:21:19.324 --> 03:21:19.744]  Exactly.
[03:21:19.744 --> 03:21:21.165]  They're a victim.
[03:21:21.165 --> 03:21:26.730]  It's kind of like if a child was abused, and then if you go to say, hey, how you doing?
[03:21:26.730 --> 03:21:28.951]  And the kid moves away, is afraid.
[03:21:28.951 --> 03:21:30.733]  That isn't about you.
[03:21:30.733 --> 03:21:32.494]  They've not been given the real love.
[03:21:32.494 --> 03:21:33.875]  So you're not being rejected.
[03:21:33.875 --> 03:21:35.777]  That's the fact that they never experienced love.
[03:21:36.764 --> 03:21:49.307]  Exactly, so they don't understand what's going on and they're projecting the negative energy that they've suffered onto you, and then when you filter through it that way and you understand what's really going on, you realize you're serving as a mirror.
[03:21:49.307 --> 03:21:57.890]  I know that you're not into the new age stuff, so I'll be careful, but I call it the magic mirror and the law of reflection is the hatred... Well, no, no, I want to be clear.
[03:21:57.890 --> 03:21:58.770]  All of that's real?
[03:21:59.230 --> 03:22:04.216]  But it's the connection to God and ancestors and willing to build something to a platform.
[03:22:04.216 --> 03:22:06.418]  You just can't imagine something that happened.
[03:22:06.418 --> 03:22:08.841]  You know, we're made in the image of God as master creators.
[03:22:08.841 --> 03:22:12.365]  You know, they call Lucifer the master architect, but God's the architect, we're the architect.
[03:22:12.365 --> 03:22:14.728]  It's just you just can't then imagine it.
[03:22:14.728 --> 03:22:15.589]  That's the new age.
[03:22:15.589 --> 03:22:19.874]  The point is you have to have the will, the time, the energy, the resources, and then we can do anything.
[03:22:21.058 --> 03:22:23.519]  Yeah, you unite vision and purpose and habit.
[03:22:23.519 --> 03:22:27.461]  And so the magic mirror is when people hate you, they don't hate what they see.
[03:22:27.461 --> 03:22:29.302]  They don't actually see you.
[03:22:29.302 --> 03:22:35.845]  You're reflecting back their own inadequacies, their own failures, their own fears about the world.
[03:22:35.845 --> 03:22:43.809]  And that's why you have to remain tall, remain proud and realize you're holding up a mirror to all of existence and that for a lot of people, they see that image.
[03:22:44.429 --> 03:22:45.930]  And to them, it's an ugly image.
[03:22:45.930 --> 03:22:49.273]  And then rather than look inward and say, why am I an ugly person?
[03:22:49.273 --> 03:22:51.315]  They want to lash out at you and attack you.
[03:22:51.315 --> 03:22:53.777]  It's amazing.
[03:22:53.777 --> 03:22:54.157]  Wow.
[03:22:54.157 --> 03:22:57.220]  Well, Mike Cernovich, I just I'm thinking.
[03:23:00.339 --> 03:23:06.941]  The problem is there's hours and hours of tape, and I kind of need to see what they put out so that I can go back and actually find what I said to counter it.
[03:23:06.941 --> 03:23:08.582]  And of course they're trying to float they might sue me.
[03:23:08.582 --> 03:23:09.502]  You're a lawyer.
[03:23:09.502 --> 03:23:10.682]  I don't think they've got any case.
[03:23:10.682 --> 03:23:11.923]  It's a one-party consent state.
[03:23:11.923 --> 03:23:13.703]  She was calling me.
[03:23:13.703 --> 03:23:15.424]  She was warranting that it wasn't going to be a hit piece.
[03:23:15.424 --> 03:23:16.424]  I knew it was.
[03:23:16.424 --> 03:23:17.985]  I mean, I need to be able to prove that she's a liar.
[03:23:19.704 --> 03:23:28.709]  Well, my philosophy, well, first of all, there's nothing illegal about recording somebody, because I record them all the time, because you have to have an expectation of privacy.
[03:23:28.709 --> 03:23:29.689]  I'll be honest, I never do.
[03:23:29.689 --> 03:23:34.192]  And if you put a microphone in my face, then there's no expectation of privacy, so that's nonsense.
[03:23:34.192 --> 03:23:37.494]  Now, could they sue you for damages, for ratings, or whatever?
[03:23:37.494 --> 03:23:40.195]  I would love for NBC to sue you.
[03:23:40.195 --> 03:23:42.937]  That would be a PR, like, bonanza.
[03:23:42.937 --> 03:23:47.119]  That would be, you could get discovery, you could demand... Sure, sure, the only way they might
[03:23:47.159 --> 03:23:50.481]  I'll tell you what I did with 60 Minutes when I gave them record ratings and revived some careers.
[03:24:12.441 --> 03:24:15.983]  Yeah, I transcribed the whole thing.
[03:24:15.983 --> 03:24:19.825]  That way I could have everything sequenced, right?
[03:24:19.825 --> 03:24:25.068]  The whole thing transcribed, and I said, if they did me dirty, then I would release the full audio.
[03:24:25.068 --> 03:24:26.529]  But they didn't actually do me dirty.
[03:24:26.529 --> 03:24:28.270]  They were a little mean, they were a little critical.
[03:24:28.270 --> 03:24:38.715]  Pele was so delusional, he thought when he told you, Hillary says she didn't fall down, the campaign said like, that was God, you laughed at him, he didn't get, they had no more credibility.
[03:24:38.715 --> 03:24:39.876]  He was totally delusional.
[03:24:40.905 --> 03:24:45.909]  Right, so he called me fake news and threw a little shade my way, but to me that's a fair fight.
[03:24:45.909 --> 03:24:52.155]  They didn't edit questions out of context, so I consider that piece on me on 60 Minutes, I consider that real journalism.
[03:24:52.155 --> 03:24:53.376]  And you won, and you won.
[03:24:53.376 --> 03:24:54.597]  And she wasn't going to let that happen.
[03:24:54.597 --> 03:24:57.880]  Putin gave her 15 minutes, he kicked her ass because they couldn't really edit it down.
[03:24:57.880 --> 03:25:00.061]  I gave them, like I said, almost 12 hours.
[03:25:00.061 --> 03:25:05.106]  So, I mean, from what I saw from the promo, Mike, it is totally unrecognizable what I said.
[03:25:06.072 --> 03:25:10.593]  Yeah, I would have the whole thing transcribed so you can write articles too.
[03:25:10.593 --> 03:25:17.815]  And then that'll also give you a time sequence so then when they air a footage, then you have right on the tape where to do it.
[03:25:17.815 --> 03:25:31.818]  The problem is though, they'll then misrepresent what's in the video if I wait till after, if I release it before, then people, the HUMET, the public will already in real time be analyzing where she lied and did things in the event.
[03:25:31.818 --> 03:25:33.399]  Maybe I should launch torpedoes now.
[03:25:34.609 --> 03:25:39.154]  No, because right now, you've owned the news cycle for a week, okay?
[03:25:39.154 --> 03:25:40.536]  Little bit at a time.
[03:25:40.536 --> 03:25:40.957]  Chopped.
[03:25:40.957 --> 03:25:43.660]  You're chop, chop, chopping away at the narrative.
[03:25:43.660 --> 03:25:46.003]  So right now, you own the narrative, alright?
[03:25:46.003 --> 03:25:48.126]  You've already won, okay?
[03:25:48.126 --> 03:25:51.470]  I've been going with the water torture, that's what my gut told me.
[03:25:52.663 --> 03:25:58.309]  Yeah, when you have a lot of attacks, you don't want to just go nuclear all at once.
[03:25:58.309 --> 03:26:01.353]  You want to hit them here, hit them here, keep pounding away.
[03:26:01.353 --> 03:26:04.136]  Just like in boxing, work the body, work the body before the head shot.
[03:26:04.136 --> 03:26:05.117]  Let me ask you this, I agree.
[03:26:05.117 --> 03:26:09.261]  Do you think, before the big uppercut, do you think they'll be more careful about the edit?
[03:26:09.261 --> 03:26:12.385]  Or will they still just be arrogant and put on a total fiasco?
[03:26:13.422 --> 03:26:14.782]  Oh, they're shook.
[03:26:14.782 --> 03:26:18.283]  And in truth, they should just pull it because now they can't win.
[03:26:18.283 --> 03:26:21.624]  They're going to get the ratings win, the Sandy Hook people are mad.
[03:26:21.624 --> 03:26:27.806]  You, if they do you dirty, tens of millions of people are going to watch them, expose them, right?
[03:26:27.806 --> 03:26:29.106]  Because we'll be doing it live.
[03:26:29.106 --> 03:26:34.228]  I'm going to be doing a live play-by-play of the video as it happens, right?
[03:26:34.228 --> 03:26:36.968]  This is like the big, this is Mayweather McGregor.
[03:26:36.968 --> 03:26:37.889]  I'm going to do it too.
[03:26:37.889 --> 03:26:39.009]  I almost wish you could fly out here.
[03:26:40.202 --> 03:26:47.526]  Yeah, this is, maybe we should do, maybe I would fly out for that and we could just all be in like a roundtable, you know, kind of talk and we'll think about that.
[03:26:47.526 --> 03:26:54.350]  You want to jump on a plane, we could do it here Sunday, maybe go on early, like 2, do the show, then take a break and then do it live and take calls.
[03:26:54.350 --> 03:26:58.011]  I don't know, or maybe you could just be on this via Skype, but I was already thinking to do that too.
[03:26:58.011 --> 03:27:01.353]  Yeah, we'll do like a round, sort of how Joe Rogan has the UFC roundtable.
[03:27:01.353 --> 03:27:06.056]  I want to build a deal where we have like a big TV and then we kind of have a roundtable, exactly like Mystery Science Theater.
[03:27:06.826 --> 03:27:07.807]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:27:07.807 --> 03:27:10.629]  So then, you know, Joe bringing Eddie Bravo and a few other guys.
[03:27:10.629 --> 03:27:18.796]  So we could do that and just live stream it, whether we do it on Skype or in person or whatever, and just get a roundtable of people.
[03:27:18.796 --> 03:27:23.760]  And then more people are going to watch that show than are watching the other shows we're live commenting.
[03:27:23.760 --> 03:27:29.805]  And then as they're doing it dirty, you want to have production people on staff with videos preloaded.
[03:27:29.805 --> 03:27:31.766]  And then you just start launching those like Tom Holland.
[03:27:31.766 --> 03:27:32.767]  Sure, I don't have the crew for that.
[03:27:32.767 --> 03:27:33.888]  We've got hours of this audio.
[03:27:35.149 --> 03:27:38.231]  Trying to chronicle it all, and you know, the audio is from about 10 feet away.
[03:27:38.231 --> 03:27:38.951]  It's good audio.
[03:27:38.951 --> 03:27:41.833]  It's kind of roomy, but I just can't believe this.
[03:27:41.833 --> 03:27:46.836]  I don't know what they're going to do, because I mean, I would say stuff like the third time she asked me about, you know, Sandy Hook, I'd say...
[03:27:47.970 --> 03:27:50.891]  Listen, they lied about the babies in incubators and the WMDs.
[03:27:50.891 --> 03:27:55.492]  Of course it's okay to question stuff, but I thought, you know, and then she would just go, Iraq?
[03:27:55.492 --> 03:27:56.172]  You're dodging.
[03:27:56.172 --> 03:28:01.073]  And I knew then, I even knew, she's going to cut off that to make it just sound like I just said Iraq.
[03:28:01.073 --> 03:28:02.133]  And then sure enough, they did it.
[03:28:02.133 --> 03:28:03.493]  I mean, I can see what they're going to do.
[03:28:03.493 --> 03:28:05.134]  It's ridiculous.
[03:28:05.134 --> 03:28:07.914]  Well, and that's what HBO is going to do to me.
[03:28:07.914 --> 03:28:09.234]  But, you know, I have the recording.
[03:28:09.234 --> 03:28:11.775]  You just have to realize, and this is another thing too, okay?
[03:28:12.655 --> 03:28:16.497]  And this is taught about the Bible to who much is given much is expected.
[03:28:16.497 --> 03:28:22.919]  You are given amazing talents and IQ off the charts, charisma, energy that nobody else will have.
[03:28:22.919 --> 03:28:24.499]  So you just have to take the blows.
[03:28:24.499 --> 03:28:26.240]  That is the way the universe works.
[03:28:26.240 --> 03:28:30.982]  You can't get all these great gifts and then be surprised when you're gonna get attacked too.
[03:28:32.025 --> 03:28:32.705]  That's what's sad.
[03:28:32.705 --> 03:28:33.706]  Well, we all have great guests.
[03:28:33.706 --> 03:28:35.526]  Most of them don't ever get expressed.
[03:28:35.526 --> 03:28:36.287]  I want to go out to break.
[03:28:36.287 --> 03:28:37.707]  You're going to take over, Mike.
[03:28:37.707 --> 03:28:40.829]  Let's talk after the show, as you both get busy with playing something.
[03:28:40.829 --> 03:28:44.290]  Again, Mike Cernovich, also, we're going to come back and put the Tom Brokaw clip and let you comment on that.
[03:28:44.290 --> 03:28:49.332]  I mean, he says, I am a total, complete racist, unalloyed racist with no proof.
[03:28:49.332 --> 03:28:51.713]  Talk about fake news, the Russian narrative.
[03:28:51.713 --> 03:28:54.334]  You have a guest coming up next segment, so I'll let you take over and do that.
[03:28:54.334 --> 03:28:56.275]  But if you want to comment on that.
[03:28:56.275 --> 03:28:57.876]  Mike Cernovich, thank you so much, my friend.
[03:28:57.876 --> 03:28:58.196]  Take over.
[03:28:59.175 --> 03:29:04.420]  Yeah, no, I mean, it'll be a lot of fun, and the attacks are a great thing.
[03:29:04.420 --> 03:29:07.983]  The truth is, though, Alex and I had a big talk last night.
[03:29:07.983 --> 03:29:15.950]  This isn't public yet, but we're going to have a meeting, and we want to build a whole team up, so that's why we need infowarestore.com.
[03:29:15.950 --> 03:29:18.292]  This is not, you know, I'm not driving a Ferrari.
[03:29:18.752 --> 03:29:20.293]  Alex, this is war.
[03:29:20.293 --> 03:29:21.033]  This is war.
[03:29:21.033 --> 03:29:24.676]  And by the way, separate from Infowarswar.com and free shipping, how do folks follow you?
[03:29:24.676 --> 03:29:26.077]  Because people are already awake.
[03:29:26.077 --> 03:29:26.937]  They're the Infowars.
[03:29:26.937 --> 03:29:29.959]  How do they help push out the great work you're doing on Twitter?
[03:29:29.959 --> 03:29:34.182]  Twitter.com forward slash, my last name, C-E-R-N-O-V-I-C-H.
[03:29:34.182 --> 03:29:36.263]  Twitter.com forward slash Cernovich.
[03:29:36.263 --> 03:29:39.705]  We have a great video exposing CNN for spreading fake news.
[03:29:39.705 --> 03:29:41.306]  We're going to actually play that in the segment.
[03:29:41.306 --> 03:29:42.807]  So we've got a lot going on.
[03:29:42.807 --> 03:29:45.148]  I hope everybody is as fired up as you and I are.
[03:29:45.148 --> 03:29:45.849]  Wow, amazing.
[03:29:45.849 --> 03:29:47.350]  Mike Cernovich gives me so much energy.
[03:29:47.350 --> 03:29:47.470]  Wow.
[03:29:49.821 --> 03:29:53.754]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:53.754 --> 03:29:56.442]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:00.953 --> 03:30:09.917]  Following the liberal outcry over Megyn Kelly interviewing Alex Jones, NBC News executives have been scrambling to further edit their hit piece on Alex Jones.
[03:30:09.917 --> 03:30:22.263]  The word now is that Megyn Kelly has changed her Sunday night show featuring Alex Jones' interview by inviting Sandy Hook families on to play edited clips of Alex talking while they have the parents emotionally respond.
[03:30:22.263 --> 03:30:29.846]  One thing is for sure, with how long it's taking NBC to edit Megyn Kelly's interview with Alex Jones prior to just airing it, we can expect
[03:30:29.906 --> 03:30:34.170]  I expect that they will be misrepresenting his statements with skilled editing techniques.
[03:30:34.170 --> 03:30:39.314]  Why not just release the entire interview unedited and prove you're not fake news, NBC?
[03:30:39.314 --> 03:30:48.162]  They'd like you to believe that Alex Jones, not Adam Lanza, is the real bad guy in the Sandy Hook massacre because he said he believes there was a government conspiracy at work.
[03:30:48.382 --> 03:30:58.270]  However, all of this will backfire on the mainstream media as everyday Americans are increasingly becoming more aware of the staging, faking, and lying that is the mainstream media.
[03:30:58.270 --> 03:31:00.672]  For more reports, go to InfoWars.com.
[03:31:00.672 --> 03:31:10.881]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet for more than a decade.
[03:31:11.081 --> 03:31:18.166]  My favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[03:31:18.166 --> 03:31:23.050]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[03:31:23.050 --> 03:31:29.835]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[03:31:29.835 --> 03:31:36.900]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[03:31:36.980 --> 03:31:44.022]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[03:31:44.022 --> 03:31:48.503]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[03:31:48.503 --> 03:31:58.205]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend, you will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great-tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[03:31:58.205 --> 03:31:59.866]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[03:32:00.706 --> 03:32:11.311]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[03:32:11.311 --> 03:32:13.372]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[03:32:13.372 --> 03:32:16.233]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[03:32:16.233 --> 03:32:17.714]  It's made in the USA.
[03:32:17.714 --> 03:32:24.557]  It's filled with known compounds from Mother Nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the M4.
[03:32:24.557 --> 03:32:25.778]  It is a classical 360 wind.
[03:32:26.618 --> 03:32:36.320]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[03:32:36.320 --> 03:32:53.124]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be, because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brushfires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[03:32:53.124 --> 03:32:56.285]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[03:32:56.425 --> 03:33:24.258]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield and InfoWarsLive.com Discover trends and global developments years before they happen right here on the Alex Jones Show and now your host Mike Cernovich and we're back
[03:33:24.702 --> 03:33:26.424]  What do you think of that bumper music?
[03:33:26.424 --> 03:33:26.764]  Ha!
[03:33:26.764 --> 03:33:28.485]  I tell you, these guys are great.
[03:33:28.485 --> 03:33:31.187]  That's why the support is so important.
[03:33:31.187 --> 03:33:39.474]  And speaking of support, we have a great guest coming up for you, Corey Stewart, who was a Republican gubernatorial candidate for Virginia.
[03:33:39.474 --> 03:33:41.376]  Everybody said he had no shot.
[03:33:41.376 --> 03:33:44.198]  Everybody said that the Trump movement was dead.
[03:33:44.198 --> 03:33:47.321]  Everybody said he would lose by 20 percentage points.
[03:33:47.321 --> 03:33:50.484]  He came within a hair's breadth.
[03:33:51.184 --> 03:33:52.205]  Not breath.
[03:33:52.205 --> 03:33:52.985]  Breath.
[03:33:52.985 --> 03:33:53.826]  The width of it.
[03:33:53.826 --> 03:33:54.926]  I got that wrong.
[03:33:54.926 --> 03:33:58.328]  Clip that away and use that, haters, to show me as an idiot.
[03:33:58.328 --> 03:34:02.891]  So he came so close to winning, but he's not out of the game yet.
[03:34:02.891 --> 03:34:06.533]  So, Corey, if you're live, I would love to see your face and talk to you.
[03:34:06.533 --> 03:34:08.214]  Hey, great to be on your show, Mike.
[03:34:08.214 --> 03:34:10.235]  Really appreciate it.
[03:34:10.235 --> 03:34:15.718]  Yeah, so speaking of which, I interviewed you for the first time October of last year, didn't I?
[03:34:16.724 --> 03:34:25.230]  He did, right after the protest that it held outside of the RNC headquarters last October.
[03:34:25.230 --> 03:34:34.196]  So what I'm seeing now with a lot of people is they're trying to get on the bandwagon and they're committing fraud and claiming that they always supported the American people, that they were always patriots.
[03:34:34.196 --> 03:34:39.159]  And then I go back to the social media and I go, wait a minute, where were you for the past 18 months?
[03:34:39.159 --> 03:34:41.981]  But you were actually fired for being too patriotic.
[03:34:43.566 --> 03:34:49.713]  Yeah, you know, so what would happen, you know, what happened in the aftermath of the Access Hollywood scandal last October?
[03:34:49.713 --> 03:35:02.107]  You know, all the Republicans' establishment was running away from President Trump, including, you know, the guy that I was running against, you know, Ed Gillespie, who's now running, who won the nomination last Tuesday.
[03:35:02.708 --> 03:35:06.630]  So I held a protest outside of RNC headquarters.
[03:35:06.630 --> 03:35:20.416]  We brought in a whole lot of women's groups, Republican women from Pennsylvania, Delaware, Virginia, Washington, and said, hey, look, to the RNC, you got to quit running away from our nominee.
[03:35:22.417 --> 03:35:23.638]  And you've got to support him.
[03:35:23.638 --> 03:35:32.344]  And because of that, and because, you know, there were some establishment figures inside of the RNC who put the pressure on the Trump team to have me fired.
[03:35:32.344 --> 03:35:33.745]  They were trying to get rid of me anyway.
[03:35:33.745 --> 03:35:34.946]  But we did it.
[03:35:34.946 --> 03:35:35.787]  It was the right thing to do.
[03:35:35.787 --> 03:35:38.909]  I put some pressure on the RNC to re-embrace Trump.
[03:35:40.129 --> 03:35:41.310]  Yeah, it was a great move.
[03:35:41.310 --> 03:35:43.532]  We actually raised holy hell.
[03:35:43.532 --> 03:35:46.193]  Me and my people, we had hashtags and people calling.
[03:35:46.193 --> 03:35:48.535]  We actually shut down the GOP phone line.
[03:35:48.535 --> 03:35:54.700]  We had so many people calling about the sabotage about the GOP and of course they're sabotaging Trump now.
[03:35:54.700 --> 03:35:57.041]  So I'm glad that you came back strong.
[03:35:57.041 --> 03:36:04.226]  My only regret is that I've been so busy doing journalism and breaking all these worldwide stories that I wasn't able to send firepower your way.
[03:36:04.226 --> 03:36:06.228]  You know, I feel like we missed a big opportunity.
[03:36:07.495 --> 03:36:08.616]  Well, I appreciate that.
[03:36:08.616 --> 03:36:17.623]  But, you know, I feel that the New Right movement really kind of coalesced around my candidacy.
[03:36:17.623 --> 03:36:21.185]  We showed that the establishment was wrong.
[03:36:21.185 --> 03:36:23.107]  They had all the money.
[03:36:23.107 --> 03:36:26.770]  I mean, Ed Gillespie had all fundraising, you know, five to one.
[03:36:26.770 --> 03:36:30.252]  He had the entire establishment behind him.
[03:36:30.252 --> 03:36:34.836]  Every member of the General Assembly, Republican member virtually, was behind him.
[03:36:35.376 --> 03:36:38.519]  They had President Bush do a fundraiser for him.
[03:36:38.519 --> 03:36:39.499]  The whole works.
[03:36:39.499 --> 03:36:41.021]  It was very intimidating.
[03:36:41.021 --> 03:36:42.782]  But we had a stronger message.
[03:36:42.782 --> 03:36:46.104]  We stood by the President of the United States.
[03:36:46.104 --> 03:36:49.407]  And we stood up against the oil immigration.
[03:36:49.407 --> 03:36:53.910]  We stood to defend our heritage and our history.
[03:36:53.910 --> 03:36:55.171]  And people responded to that.
[03:36:55.171 --> 03:36:59.495]  At one, almost half the state, including almost all the rural areas,
[03:37:00.916 --> 03:37:11.343]  Yeah, so actually, let's talk about that.
[03:37:11.343 --> 03:37:14.065]  You mentioned a couple points, so I followed it closely.
[03:37:14.065 --> 03:37:20.530]  Maybe a lot of people listening and watching aren't aware of this, but the polls said that you were going to lose by 20%.
[03:37:20.530 --> 03:37:21.170]  Isn't that right?
[03:37:21.170 --> 03:37:23.952]  That's exactly what they said.
[03:37:23.952 --> 03:37:27.935]  And Ed Gillespie and the establishment, they outspent you 5-1, right?
[03:37:29.684 --> 03:37:31.326]  5-1.
[03:37:31.326 --> 03:37:33.629]  How did you finish?
[03:37:33.629 --> 03:37:39.276]  We finished with 42.5% and Ed Gillespie finished with 43.7% so he barely eeked it out by a little over 1%.
[03:37:48.379 --> 03:37:51.502]  Right, so that really, and again, that is the message.
[03:37:51.502 --> 03:37:59.210]  You know, Alex and I talk about that a lot too, the messaging that people are getting is the media, they're creating fake polls to get people to stay home.
[03:37:59.210 --> 03:38:01.752]  That's why they're going to say, Corey Stewart has no shot.
[03:38:01.752 --> 03:38:03.234]  He's going to lose by 20%.
[03:38:03.234 --> 03:38:04.795]  Don't give a dollar to that guy.
[03:38:04.795 --> 03:38:06.357]  Don't go knock on doors.
[03:38:06.357 --> 03:38:07.198]  Don't get online.
[03:38:07.198 --> 03:38:09.060]  Don't support this guy because he's not going to win.
[03:38:09.600 --> 03:38:13.345]  That's why everybody listening and watching, you just cannot watch fake news media.
[03:38:13.345 --> 03:38:14.627]  You cannot watch the polls.
[03:38:14.627 --> 03:38:18.832]  They are psyops designed to demoralize us and try to divide us.
[03:38:18.832 --> 03:38:22.337]  And I was really impressed with how well you did.
[03:38:22.337 --> 03:38:26.543]  And again, my only regret is that I just wasn't following the race closely soon enough.
[03:38:27.984 --> 03:38:28.965]  Well, thanks a lot.
[03:38:28.965 --> 03:38:39.217]  I mean, you know, uh, you know, these polls that you're mentioning, I think that it is true that they were deliberately, in some cases deliberately, trying to tell people that the polls were, you know, that I didn't have a chance.
[03:38:39.217 --> 03:38:45.144]  And, you know, so my people should either, you know, vote for Ed because he's going to be the winner or just stay home.
[03:38:45.144 --> 03:38:46.986]  But look, I think a lot of this also
[03:38:47.546 --> 03:38:55.848]  The thing is, though, is that in the aftermath of 2016, you know, President Trump activated a lot of people in 2016.
[03:38:55.848 --> 03:39:00.109]  They're still out there, people who had never voted in a Republican primary before.
[03:39:00.109 --> 03:39:01.610]  Now they're willing to go out there and vote.
[03:39:01.610 --> 03:39:03.890]  And I think that's what my candidacy showed.
[03:39:03.890 --> 03:39:05.251]  They're still out there.
[03:39:05.251 --> 03:39:10.672]  There's still a lot of support for President Trump and people more than that, even though it's not just about President Trump.
[03:39:11.292 --> 03:39:13.813]  People are looking for a fighter.
[03:39:13.813 --> 03:39:15.373]  They want a Republican.
[03:39:15.373 --> 03:39:18.633]  They want a conservative who's going to push back.
[03:39:18.633 --> 03:39:21.694]  Somebody who's going to push it right back to the liberals.
[03:39:21.694 --> 03:39:23.775]  And then, you know, that's what I did.
[03:39:23.775 --> 03:39:27.555]  And we also drove people to my website, CoreyStewart.com.
[03:39:27.555 --> 03:39:33.136]  We used a lot of social media very effectively, had a very hard edged image.
[03:39:33.136 --> 03:39:35.397]  We were not afraid to attack, attack, attack.
[03:39:36.907 --> 03:39:39.589]  Yeah, Katya, she was your communications manager, wasn't she?
[03:39:39.589 --> 03:39:39.869]  I believe?
[03:39:49.036 --> 03:39:53.538]  No, we had Noel Fritsch was my communications guy.
[03:39:53.538 --> 03:40:02.742]  You know what I had done actually is I had assembled together, this is an interesting thing I think that could be instructive to other, you know, new conservatives.
[03:40:02.742 --> 03:40:06.183]  I had pulled together not just, you know, the Trump team.
[03:40:06.183 --> 03:40:10.205]  We had a lot of Trump people on my campaign team, but a lot of Cruz people.
[03:40:11.365 --> 03:40:14.327]  And Rand Paul people.
[03:40:14.327 --> 03:40:20.411]  And so together, we were able to pull together those three campaigns, fight against the establishment candidate.
[03:40:20.411 --> 03:40:23.834]  You know, people coming from different perspectives, and that was a very important thing.
[03:40:25.188 --> 03:40:26.928]  Yeah, so that's the thing.
[03:40:26.928 --> 03:40:28.429]  I buried the hatchet.
[03:40:28.429 --> 03:40:29.989]  Friends of mine were pro-Rubio.
[03:40:29.989 --> 03:40:32.630]  Friends of mine were, you know, pro-Cruz and stuff.
[03:40:32.630 --> 03:40:34.990]  And I just said everybody who wants to unite.
[03:40:34.990 --> 03:40:37.931]  Because we have terrorists on the left trying to murder us.
[03:40:37.931 --> 03:40:44.352]  So I didn't have time to complain that maybe somebody was a Cruz guy or a Rand Paul guy or a Rubio guy or maybe I called some guy a cuck.
[03:40:44.352 --> 03:40:45.293]  People got to get over me.
[03:40:45.293 --> 03:40:48.673]  I did what I had to do to win and I said what I had to say to win.
[03:40:48.673 --> 03:40:50.974]  So I don't have time for people who are still nursing.
[03:40:51.614 --> 03:40:52.395]  We're good to go.
[03:41:16.389 --> 03:41:16.689]  Yeah, well...
[03:41:32.560 --> 03:41:35.643]  You know, what I'm thinking about next, you know, I am considering it.
[03:41:35.643 --> 03:41:39.607]  I mean, I've been campaigning for five and a half of the last seven years.
[03:41:39.607 --> 03:41:42.550]  I ran for lieutenant governor and governor.
[03:41:42.550 --> 03:41:45.393]  I also, you know, ran President Trump's campaign here in Virginia.
[03:41:45.393 --> 03:41:47.876]  And then, you know, re-election twice.
[03:41:47.876 --> 03:41:49.758]  So I've been campaigning a long time.
[03:41:49.758 --> 03:41:52.220]  And frankly, I need to take a little bit of a breather.
[03:41:52.220 --> 03:41:55.584]  But there is an open Senate seat, not an open seat, but Tim Kaine,
[03:41:56.784 --> 03:41:58.725]  It is up for reelection next year in 2018.
[03:41:58.725 --> 03:42:11.951]  I think there are a lot of people who want me to go out there and go ahead and fight for that and enter the battle to become the Republican nominee to challenge Tim Kaine.
[03:42:11.951 --> 03:42:14.092]  I'm the only one who's been able to win up in Northern Virginia.
[03:42:14.092 --> 03:42:15.853]  That's a very tough area for Republicans.
[03:42:15.853 --> 03:42:16.973]  That's where my district is.
[03:42:16.973 --> 03:42:22.216]  I represent about a half million people, leading a big locality up here in Northern Virginia.
[03:42:22.216 --> 03:42:23.076]  So I'm thinking about it.
[03:42:23.576 --> 03:42:41.329]  I think the key to, you know, knocking off or trying, getting very close anyway, to knocking off a big establishment Republican like Ed Gillespie is one, you know, as these establishment figures run away from the President, you need to do just the opposite.
[03:42:41.329 --> 03:42:43.731]  You need to embrace the President of the United States.
[03:42:43.731 --> 03:42:44.651]  You need to protect him.
[03:42:44.651 --> 03:42:45.552]  You need to defend him.
[03:42:45.552 --> 03:42:47.734]  You need to promote him, which is what I did.
[03:42:48.274 --> 03:43:02.771]  I also stood very strong and my message was deliberately a little bit edgy and actually deliberately controversial to earn the media, Fox News and others.
[03:43:02.771 --> 03:43:05.775]  You know, when you're a little bit over the edge, that's how you're going to get
[03:43:06.215 --> 03:43:10.998]  There are immediate attention necessary to help make up for the financial disadvantage.
[03:43:10.998 --> 03:43:19.204]  And the issue that helped me out a lot was defending Confederate monuments, historical monuments.
[03:43:19.204 --> 03:43:20.485]  It's a big issue.
[03:43:20.485 --> 03:43:23.947]  And this is one that's rising real fast, by the way.
[03:43:23.947 --> 03:43:29.171]  This is, you know, as these monuments are being removed across the country, New Orleans and other places,
[03:43:29.751 --> 03:43:32.313]  People are very, very offended by that.
[03:43:32.313 --> 03:43:34.594]  They're very protective of their history.
[03:43:34.594 --> 03:43:38.296]  I stood by it, and it got me a lot of news coverage.
[03:43:38.296 --> 03:43:42.099]  And by the way, that's something that other Republicans should not be afraid to do.
[03:43:42.099 --> 03:43:44.400]  Go ahead, defend history.
[03:43:44.400 --> 03:43:46.902]  And, you know, that was a big part of it.
[03:43:47.842 --> 03:43:50.604]  Yeah, and I just want to give you a plug and endorsement.
[03:43:50.604 --> 03:43:57.909]  So CNN actually wrote an entire article crying that Corey Stewart, you know, gave me an interview in October.
[03:43:57.909 --> 03:44:00.830]  So CNN was like, you know, Cernovich is this evil guy.
[03:44:00.830 --> 03:44:02.752]  Corey, you better disavow him.
[03:44:02.752 --> 03:44:04.693]  And you just laughed and said, shut up, guys.
[03:44:04.693 --> 03:44:05.814]  I don't care what CNN says.
[03:44:07.119 --> 03:44:08.881]  Yeah, man, I think you're doing a great job.
[03:44:08.881 --> 03:44:09.522]  I really do.
[03:44:09.522 --> 03:44:11.764]  I mean, that's what they try to do.
[03:44:11.764 --> 03:44:26.219]  You know, I had people who were supporting me, conservatives, and as soon as the attacks came and they tried to paint me, you know, they've been painting you for a long time, you know, as something that you're not, but they tried to paint me as a racist, a bigot, all these other things.
[03:44:26.219 --> 03:44:28.521]  You know, the latest term by the left, by the way,
[03:44:29.102 --> 03:44:32.664]  You know, 10 years ago, it was the war on women.
[03:44:32.664 --> 03:44:34.464]  The war on women this, the war on women that.
[03:44:34.464 --> 03:44:35.985]  Well, now the left has this new term.
[03:44:35.985 --> 03:44:38.266]  It's called, you know, white supremacy.
[03:44:38.266 --> 03:44:39.587]  Everything's white supremacy.
[03:44:39.587 --> 03:44:43.529]  If you support your Confederate monuments, you're a white supremacist.
[03:44:43.529 --> 03:44:48.271]  If you're a conservative and you're against healthcare, Obamacare, you're a white supremacist.
[03:44:48.271 --> 03:44:50.472]  They're going to wrap everything around it.
[03:44:50.472 --> 03:44:55.934]  And so what happens is you have all the conservatives, they get afraid of this label and they take off.
[03:44:55.934 --> 03:44:56.795]  They run for the hills.
[03:44:57.575 --> 03:45:03.001]  You have to stand strong and you got to understand that those endorsements really don't matter all that much.
[03:45:03.001 --> 03:45:04.363]  People want a fighter.
[03:45:04.363 --> 03:45:07.266]  They want somebody with courage and they will respect you for it.
[03:45:07.266 --> 03:45:09.409]  They'll vote for you.
[03:45:09.409 --> 03:45:10.891]  Can I say breaking news?
[03:45:11.761 --> 03:45:14.042]  Corey Stewart's running against Tim Kaine.
[03:45:14.042 --> 03:45:17.664]  Can I say that's breaking news exclusive right here?
[03:45:17.664 --> 03:45:23.567]  You know, if I said that, I'd have there be like a club coming down from my wife over here, right on top of my head.
[03:45:23.567 --> 03:45:26.349]  I really have to talk to her about it.
[03:45:26.349 --> 03:45:28.390]  You know, like I said, we've been campaigning together.
[03:45:28.390 --> 03:45:36.114]  She's been right with me for five and a half years, and I do need a little bit of a time to take a breather, but I'm looking at it.
[03:45:36.114 --> 03:45:37.415]  I really am.
[03:45:37.415 --> 03:45:38.195]  I'm a fighter.
[03:45:38.195 --> 03:45:39.976]  I can't stay out of the ring too long.
[03:45:39.976 --> 03:45:40.977]  I love to be in the ring.
[03:45:42.805 --> 03:45:47.407]  And 2018, I mean, we have big plans for that, you know, me and all my people and everything.
[03:45:47.407 --> 03:45:53.249]  It's going to be, we have new tactics and we'll meet off the record and I'll kind of explain to you our battle strategy.
[03:45:53.249 --> 03:45:57.470]  Because we're dominating the news cycles in ways that people can't comprehend.
[03:45:57.470 --> 03:46:01.712]  And we're going to run primary challengers against establishment GOP people.
[03:46:01.712 --> 03:46:04.393]  So we're going to, our motto is we're going to Eric Cantor people.
[03:46:04.853 --> 03:46:20.587]  We're going through districts, and we're looking at now data, and I'm saying, hey, if you're an Alex Jones guy, or Mike Cernovich guy, or Stefan Molyneux guy, or Paul Joseph Watson guy, you know, then those people are going to be where we have a concentration of listeners and readers.
[03:46:20.587 --> 03:46:21.668]  Those are the districts.
[03:46:22.208 --> 03:46:25.851]  Where we can really be, um, we can really hit the primaries.
[03:46:25.851 --> 03:46:34.857]  So I'm thinking about getting a bus, like a tour bus and doing a mobile podcasting periscope streaming tour of me and maybe some other people.
[03:46:34.857 --> 03:46:41.621]  And we're going to actually go to districts where we can run our people, our guys and the primaries.
[03:46:41.621 --> 03:46:42.502]  I haven't announced this yet.
[03:46:42.502 --> 03:46:44.283]  So this is breaking news to us.
[03:46:44.283 --> 03:46:46.084]  We're just going to get a bus and a tour.
[03:46:46.084 --> 03:46:47.965]  It'll be like a rock and roll thing.
[03:46:47.965 --> 03:46:51.788]  And we're going to hold pop-up rallies for people who want to run against the establishment.
[03:46:52.809 --> 03:47:09.944]  You know what, it's a great idea, and I think that everybody who you decide to get behind and convince them to go ahead and make that run, you need to let them know straight ahead that in order to win, they've got to earn media, they've got to be deliberately confrontational, deliberately controversial,
[03:47:12.106 --> 03:47:12.386]  We're good.
[03:47:31.974 --> 03:47:35.198]  They smell blood in the water, they come right after you.
[03:47:35.198 --> 03:47:43.651]  What President Trump did last year, which is brilliant, and which is what I did as well because I learned it from him, instead of backing down, you double down.
[03:47:43.651 --> 03:47:45.573]  Don't back down, double down.
[03:47:45.573 --> 03:47:46.515]  Go after it.
[03:47:46.515 --> 03:47:47.877]  Don't be afraid of the controversy.
[03:47:49.132 --> 03:47:52.455]  I mean, the people right now, that's why we gotta get you out, Morris.
[03:47:52.455 --> 03:47:54.516]  The more people see you, the more they like you.
[03:47:54.516 --> 03:47:56.998]  So we gotta build up your YouTubes.
[03:47:56.998 --> 03:47:59.680]  I need you doing YouTube videos.
[03:47:59.680 --> 03:48:02.101]  Professor Cernovich has given you homework.
[03:48:02.101 --> 03:48:04.903]  The more people see you, the more they're gonna like you.
[03:48:04.903 --> 03:48:11.268]  And that's another thing, too, is your social media game, live streams, kind of the way I've been building up my media platforms.
[03:48:11.268 --> 03:48:15.351]  The people who are gonna win in 2018 are the people who right now, today,
[03:48:15.951 --> 03:48:19.253]  Our blogging, Periscoping, Facebook, YouTube Live.
[03:48:19.253 --> 03:48:20.973]  Facebook Live, yeah.
[03:48:20.973 --> 03:48:21.854]  Exactly.
[03:48:21.854 --> 03:48:23.755]  We're the ones who have it.
[03:48:23.755 --> 03:48:26.916]  Exactly, because then you have your own platform.
[03:48:26.916 --> 03:48:28.617]  Yeah, that's exactly right.
[03:48:28.617 --> 03:48:31.438]  So my Facebook page, we did a ton on that.
[03:48:31.438 --> 03:48:36.580]  We actually outspent my opponent on social media, even though he had five times more money.
[03:48:36.580 --> 03:48:37.721]  That's how critical it is.
[03:48:37.721 --> 03:48:40.722]  Corey Stewart, VA, you can check it out.
[03:48:40.722 --> 03:48:42.663]  I think it's pretty instructive.
[03:48:43.523 --> 03:48:49.529]  And the website, CoreyStewart.com, of course you use that for, you know, fundraising, etc.
[03:48:49.529 --> 03:48:55.474]  But social media, the age of social media, especially on the right, is Facebook.
[03:48:55.474 --> 03:49:02.680]  That's, you know, you get a lot of your older voters, those who can vote in Republican primaries, who use Facebook a lot.
[03:49:02.680 --> 03:49:05.362]  Facebook Live is so much more important than it ever was.
[03:49:05.362 --> 03:49:09.546]  And don't be afraid to, you know, be relaxed and, you know, do things that
[03:49:10.186 --> 03:49:15.511]  You know, don't always be in a kind of a stiff suit, you know, where you're doing an interview in this kind of setting.
[03:49:15.511 --> 03:49:23.738]  I mean, sometimes you need to walk around a little bit, you know, have somebody with a Facebook Live with a camera behind you follow you in a parade or something like that.
[03:49:23.738 --> 03:49:26.480]  People like that spontaneous type of shot.
[03:49:28.021 --> 03:49:30.643]  Yeah, I mean, your social media tips are brilliant, actually.
[03:49:30.643 --> 03:49:34.867]  I just hired a first-rate video editor.
[03:49:34.867 --> 03:49:38.150]  I'm paying $10,000 a month, actually, just to grow my Facebook page organically.
[03:49:38.150 --> 03:49:39.731]  That's how important it is.
[03:49:39.731 --> 03:49:44.155]  My videos are now doing 5 to 10 million views a week, and my page is still tiny.
[03:49:44.155 --> 03:49:45.696]  So, yeah, that's the whole thing.
[03:49:45.696 --> 03:49:47.057]  I've never bought an advertisement.
[03:49:47.057 --> 03:49:48.038]  You don't need to.
[03:49:48.038 --> 03:49:49.980]  Facebook videos, cutting it.
[03:49:49.980 --> 03:49:51.401]  People want to see behind the scenes.
[03:49:51.401 --> 03:49:52.862]  That's another thing I've been telling people.
[03:49:54.163 --> 03:49:57.464]  People laugh at me, but I go, you know where I'm learning about politics?
[03:49:57.464 --> 03:49:58.045]  And they go, where?
[03:49:58.045 --> 03:49:59.785]  I go, you know where I'm learning about journalism?
[03:49:59.785 --> 03:50:00.425]  They go, where?
[03:50:00.425 --> 03:50:04.187]  I go, I've watched a ton of videos from the makeup girls.
[03:50:04.187 --> 03:50:12.170]  Just tips on shooting a scene, connecting with your audience, you know, creating connection, the discipline that they have.
[03:50:12.170 --> 03:50:13.950]  So I think that there's a lot of value there.
[03:50:13.950 --> 03:50:16.831]  So I want to give you the last sort of 45 seconds.
[03:50:16.831 --> 03:50:17.352]  Who are you?
[03:50:17.352 --> 03:50:17.932]  What are you going to do?
[03:50:17.932 --> 03:50:18.372]  What's next?
[03:50:19.426 --> 03:50:20.867]  Well, I'm Corey Stewart.
[03:50:20.867 --> 03:50:36.734]  I almost knocked off an establishment figure who used to be the chairman of the RNC, and somebody who got a lot of money from the Bush family and everything else, somebody who outspent me 5-1, and we almost knocked him off the gubernatorial primary this past Tuesday.
[03:50:36.734 --> 03:50:42.396]  I am considering running for the United States Senate against Tim Kaine in January 2018.

[03:54:07.570 --> 03:54:08.511]  Reports.
[03:54:08.511 --> 03:54:10.732]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:10.732 --> 03:54:13.733]  And now, your host, Mike Cernovich.
[03:54:16.992 --> 03:54:18.894]  And we're back for another segment.
[03:54:18.894 --> 03:54:28.001]  We're going to have Corey Stewart on, but what we were talking about earlier and why it's so important, right now there is free shipping at InfoWarStore.com.
[03:54:28.001 --> 03:54:29.502]  This is how you fund the resistance.
[03:54:29.502 --> 03:54:32.945]  This is how you fund things happening.
[03:54:32.945 --> 03:54:35.507]  Alex Jones, again, there are no big sponsors.
[03:54:35.507 --> 03:54:36.488]  It's not like NBC.
[03:54:36.488 --> 03:54:37.689]  There aren't big pharma.
[03:54:37.689 --> 03:54:39.471]  There isn't big drug companies.
[03:54:39.471 --> 03:54:41.552]  Me personally, I like the Caveman.
[03:54:43.374 --> 03:54:44.295]  That is what I like.
[03:54:44.295 --> 03:54:45.777]  The coffee is amazing, too.
[03:54:45.777 --> 03:54:49.160]  The toothpaste, too, is what we're using in my family.
[03:54:49.160 --> 03:54:50.682]  It's fluoride-free.
[03:54:50.682 --> 03:54:54.066]  So right now, it is site-wide free shipping.
[03:54:54.066 --> 03:54:59.592]  It's so important for your support, and we all know it, and we all need it even more now that it's coming on Father's Day.
[03:55:00.032 --> 03:55:04.015]  And the hit piece on Father's Day planned against Alex Jones.
[03:55:04.015 --> 03:55:07.137]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.
[03:55:07.137 --> 03:55:08.338]  It's so key.
[03:55:08.338 --> 03:55:11.880]  That is what funds this operation, which needs to grow.
[03:55:11.880 --> 03:55:18.645]  Alex, actually, again, I don't want to, you know, scoop him or leak too much, but what we talked about was massive.
[03:55:18.645 --> 03:55:23.628]  We talked about bringing on a whole new team of journalists, breaking news and breaking scoops.
[03:55:23.628 --> 03:55:26.591]  And we want people to be able to actually have a career doing this.
[03:55:26.591 --> 03:55:27.791]  So your support is so great.
[03:55:27.791 --> 03:55:28.432]  Thank you very much.
[03:55:29.406 --> 03:55:31.069]  And I think we have Corey back on.
[03:55:31.069 --> 03:55:31.810]  Is Corey back on?
[03:55:31.810 --> 03:55:33.412]  I'm back on.
[03:55:33.412 --> 03:55:35.114]  All right, Corey.
[03:55:35.114 --> 03:55:39.681]  So here's what I want to do for like kind of fun off the top of your head.
[03:55:39.681 --> 03:55:41.363]  We got a three minute segment.
[03:55:41.363 --> 03:55:45.650]  What are your top three tips for an insurgent candidate who wants to run for office?
[03:55:47.008 --> 03:55:48.589]  Be controversial.
[03:55:48.589 --> 03:55:50.611]  Don't be afraid of controversy.
[03:55:50.611 --> 03:55:52.913]  Attack, attack, attack.
[03:55:52.913 --> 03:55:55.355]  Earn the social media.
[03:55:55.355 --> 03:55:59.719]  Earn the earned media by deliberately being edgy and controversial.
[03:55:59.719 --> 03:56:06.125]  Number two, put a lot of money, put a lot of your resources into social media, especially Facebook.
[03:56:06.125 --> 03:56:08.047]  Do a lot of Facebook Live.
[03:56:08.047 --> 03:56:09.288]  Constantly keep in touch.
[03:56:09.708 --> 03:56:11.349]  Do things that are interesting.
[03:56:11.349 --> 03:56:12.170]  Don't be boring.
[03:56:12.170 --> 03:56:15.633]  Don't always just show up in front of a desk like I'm sitting here right now.
[03:56:15.633 --> 03:56:22.658]  Sometimes, you know, just go out and, you know, go out with your, do something interesting and do a Facebook Live shot.
[03:56:22.658 --> 03:56:27.702]  Number three, you know, bring in people from different parts of the political spectrum on the right.
[03:56:27.702 --> 03:56:29.984]  Bring in, you know, like I did, bring in the cruise people.
[03:56:30.484 --> 03:56:31.785]  Bring in the Trump people.
[03:56:31.785 --> 03:56:33.807]  Bring in the Rand Paul people.
[03:56:33.807 --> 03:56:39.553]  And when you do that, I think that you're going to, and always remain edgy.
[03:56:39.553 --> 03:56:40.974]  And here's an upcoming one.
[03:56:40.974 --> 03:56:50.683]  The number one issue that's coming up for the right is going to be defense of Confederate memorials, defense of our history, because it's happening not just to the South, but across the country.
[03:56:50.683 --> 03:56:53.446]  Don't be afraid to grab it and hold on to it.
[03:56:54.451 --> 03:57:07.980]  Well, I've been telling people that they're not going to stop with the Confederate monuments because people keep asking my opinion on that and I go, I go, what you don't understand is that you can never give an inch to the enemy because they're not going to say, OK, we took down Robert E. Lee.
[03:57:07.980 --> 03:57:10.922]  Now they're going to say, well, Thomas Jefferson owned slaves.
[03:57:10.922 --> 03:57:12.883]  We need to take down Thomas Jefferson.
[03:57:12.883 --> 03:57:14.484]  We need to burn the Constitution.
[03:57:14.984 --> 03:57:29.947]  And what most don't realize is this is part of the cultural Marxist design to deconstruct history, to destroy heroic figures in history, to make people feel isolated and disconnected from people who lived.
[03:57:29.947 --> 03:57:37.149]  And if they destroy history and tear away the social fabric, that allows them to brainwash and program people.
[03:57:37.941 --> 03:57:57.078]  Yeah, exactly, because look, the Confederate generals are the easy target, but if you can take down somebody who arguably fought to maintain the institution of slavery, well then you can take down a monument of somebody who owns slaves, and namely the founders, Madison, Jefferson, Washington, and all the others.
[03:57:57.078 --> 03:58:02.924]  If you undermine the founders, you undermine the founding documents, namely the Constitution.
[03:58:03.484 --> 03:58:09.128]  The left is putting a lot of energy into this, and it's not just to rename a few parks and take down some statues.
[03:58:09.128 --> 03:58:19.716]  They've got a much bigger end in mind, and that is to undermine the Constitution, undermine our culture, undermine the Founders, undermine our history, and basically undermine America.
[03:58:19.716 --> 03:58:20.296]  Thanks, Corey.
[03:58:20.296 --> 03:58:20.957]  You're great, man.
[03:58:20.957 --> 03:58:27.321]  So I'm planning, actually, maybe a five-day-a-week show with, like, a panel, so I need to get you on more.
[03:58:27.321 --> 03:58:27.962]  Thank you so much.
[03:58:27.962 --> 03:58:28.322]  Yeah, man.
[03:58:28.322 --> 03:58:29.823]  We've got to get you on.
[03:58:29.823 --> 03:58:32.085]  CoreyStewart.com, right?
[03:58:32.085 --> 03:58:32.465]  That's right.
[03:58:33.613 --> 03:58:34.553]  Okay, thanks again.
[03:58:34.553 --> 03:58:37.435]  So you just heard from Corey Stewart, and it looks like we are ending.
[03:58:37.435 --> 03:58:38.635]  Everybody, thanks for listening.
[03:58:38.635 --> 03:58:43.057]  This is Mike Cernovich, live for the fourth hour.
[03:58:43.057 --> 03:58:47.019]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
