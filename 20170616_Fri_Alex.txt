[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  And it's time for humanity to stand out in the Info War and say, I don't know what's
[00:12.000 --> 00:18.000]  going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you've got
[00:18.000 --> 00:19.000]  one!
[00:19.000 --> 00:36.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:36.000 --> 00:42.000]  And now for something completely different.
[00:42.000 --> 00:48.000]  Will NBC finally pull the plug on Megyn Kelly's controversial interview with radio personality
[00:48.000 --> 00:51.000]  and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones?
[00:51.000 --> 00:57.000]  So Megyn Kelly's been taking a lot of heat for interviewing radio show host Alex Jones.
[00:57.000 --> 01:02.000]  He is somebody who President Trump called after the election to thank him for his role.
[01:02.000 --> 01:04.000]  Trump had gone on his radio show during the campaign.
[01:04.000 --> 01:10.000]  Kelly and NBC are now under fire for giving airtime to the radio talk show host who has
[01:10.000 --> 01:12.000]  held the Sandy Hook school shooting of hoax.
[01:12.000 --> 01:15.000]  Megyn Kelly is gentlemen right back into the defense.
[01:15.000 --> 01:21.000]  As NBC plans to air a sit down interview with conspiracy act Alex Jones this Sunday.
[01:21.000 --> 01:26.000]  Mr. Jones doesn't talk to a lot of reporters, but we're very glad you made an exception.
[01:26.000 --> 01:32.000]  When you say parents faked their children's death, people get very angry.
[01:32.000 --> 01:35.000]  Well, that's all I know, but they don't get angry about the half-million debt I racked
[01:35.000 --> 01:38.000]  from the sanctions or they don't get angry about all these legal things.
[01:38.000 --> 01:39.000]  That's a dodge.
[01:39.000 --> 01:42.000]  The media never covers all the evil wars that's promoted.
[01:42.000 --> 01:45.000]  That doesn't excuse what you did and said about Newtown.
[01:45.000 --> 01:47.000]  Here's the difference.
[01:47.000 --> 01:54.000]  I looked at all the angles of Newtown and I made my statements long before the media picked up on it.
[01:54.000 --> 01:56.000]  I think Alex Jones is disgusting.
[01:56.000 --> 01:58.000]  I think the things he said are awful.
[01:58.000 --> 01:59.000]  He makes me physically sit.
[01:59.000 --> 02:03.000]  With that being said, he does have the ear of the president and he has six million people
[02:03.000 --> 02:07.000]  that listen to him and I would like people out there to know that there is a segment of the population
[02:07.000 --> 02:11.000]  that's drawn to this. We have a problem in this country and I would like him to be exposed.
[02:11.000 --> 02:16.000]  This is a nasty man that has harassed the parents of dead children.
[02:16.000 --> 02:21.000]  I don't think you give him a platform to more than the six million people that already follow him.
[02:21.000 --> 02:29.000]  It's not so much that NBC is creating or elevating Alex Jones as it is reflecting the fact that he is an influential guy.
[02:29.000 --> 02:34.000]  J.P. Morgan Chase holds its advertising from the show and the Sandy Hook Promise Foundation
[02:34.000 --> 02:37.000]  disinvited Kelly as host of his annual gala.
[02:37.000 --> 02:39.000]  The Sandy Hook thing is disgusting.
[02:39.000 --> 02:42.000]  He's admitted in court documents for his divorce that he doesn't believe in.
[02:42.000 --> 02:43.000]  No, I didn't eliminate him.
[02:43.000 --> 02:44.000]  He's playing a character.
[02:44.000 --> 02:48.000]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[02:48.000 --> 02:54.000]  The fact is that he is an unalloyed racist, a man who's out there pulling the pen on the grenade every day
[02:54.000 --> 02:57.000]  and he has six million viewers.
[02:57.000 --> 03:00.000]  Why give him the notoriety that he obviously creates?
[03:00.000 --> 03:02.000]  Morgan, I think he already has that love.
[03:02.000 --> 03:04.000]  People find him.
[03:04.000 --> 03:09.000]  Like, if that disgusts me more, what it says about the people that would choose to follow someone like that.
[03:09.000 --> 03:10.000]  But it says exactly what I have.
[03:10.000 --> 03:12.000]  Would you give Donald Trump airtime?
[03:12.000 --> 03:17.000]  Over the years, John, as you know, journalists have interviewed murderers and rapists and child molesters.
[03:17.000 --> 03:21.000]  I mean, the anchors have interviewed Saddam Hussein, Charles Manson, O.J. Simpson.
[03:21.000 --> 03:23.000]  So this is part of what we do.
[03:23.000 --> 03:29.000]  NBC has taken a huge gamble Sunday night, maintaining her sit-down with controversial conspiracy theorists
[03:29.000 --> 03:34.000]  and info wars host Alex Jones will air in spite of the uproar.
[03:34.000 --> 03:35.000]  Sandy Hook.
[03:35.000 --> 03:40.000]  Well, Sandy Hook's complex because I've had debates where we've devils advocates said the whole story's true.
[03:40.000 --> 03:44.000]  Then I've had debates where I've said that none of it's true.
[03:44.000 --> 03:49.000]  I'm told multiple advertisers have said to NBC, we don't want to be anywhere near this story.
[03:49.000 --> 03:51.000]  The network won't say exactly how many.
[03:51.000 --> 03:55.000]  JPMorgan Chase is the only advertiser that we know is avoiding making Kelly's shows.
[03:55.000 --> 03:58.000]  Then they also burned down Adam Lance's house.
[03:58.000 --> 04:00.000]  Look, didn't happen.
[04:00.000 --> 04:06.000]  When I explained to her both sides of it and I explained that I only had debates and looked at the full story.
[04:06.000 --> 04:08.000]  It's not going to be some gotcha hit piece.
[04:08.000 --> 04:09.000]  I promise you that.
[04:09.000 --> 04:26.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[04:26.000 --> 04:30.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[04:30.000 --> 04:34.000]  Mainstream corporate on media does not control the paradigm anymore.
[04:34.000 --> 04:41.000]  They got us into a war that killed millions of people over the years, claiming a bunch of babies got killed at a hospital.
[04:41.000 --> 04:45.000]  None of it was true, then we have a right to question everything comes out of MSM.
[04:45.000 --> 04:52.000]  Does it mean we hate the families of the victims at Newtown, which I tend to believe that attack probably happened.
[04:52.000 --> 04:53.000]  Mass shootings do happen.
[04:53.000 --> 04:58.000]  They tried to use it, the government and the media did, to take our guns and blame America for those murders.
[04:58.000 --> 05:00.000]  That's fake news.
[05:00.000 --> 05:08.000]  While the anti-American, anti-Trump Democrats are looking up each other's rear ends for Trump-Russia collusion, the real collusion is hiding in plain sight.
[05:08.000 --> 05:13.000]  It should have come as no surprise when Comey didn't prosecute Hillary Clinton for the illegal email and server scandal.
[05:13.000 --> 05:15.000]  Comey and Clinton had a history.
[05:15.000 --> 05:21.000]  In 2004, while serving as Deputy Attorney General to the Justice Department, Comey narrowed the scope of the Sandy Burger investigation
[05:21.000 --> 05:27.000]  to seclude members of the Clinton administration who may have coordinated with Burger in the destruction of classified documents.
[05:27.000 --> 05:33.000]  Burger, Cheryl Mills and now disgraced Loretta Lynch all worked together at the law firm that handled Clinton's tax returns.
[05:33.000 --> 05:38.000]  No wonder why Lynch didn't want Clinton's emails to be investigated or prosecuted.
[05:38.000 --> 05:44.000]  You throw that in with the fact Comey admitted he's the leaker and well, we have a new investigation to focus on, don't we?
[05:44.000 --> 05:49.000]  No, we don't, because the Trump administration is busy trying to make America great again.
[05:49.000 --> 05:54.000]  But perhaps someday, a real investigation into real collusion will make it to Capitol Hill
[05:54.000 --> 05:58.000]  and Lynch and Clinton will have their days to testify under oath.
[05:58.000 --> 06:27.000]  For Infowars.com, this is Owen Troyer.

[07:43.000 --> 07:47.000]  It is the exact same product, just the name is different, EmRick's Essentials,
[07:47.000 --> 07:53.000]  and it's on average 20% off what it would be in stores buying it directly from InfowarsStore.com.

[08:27.000 --> 08:30.000]  Get ready for another attack.
[08:30.000 --> 08:37.000]  We're going in discrediting the globalists, the fake news media, the foreign megabanks that have hijacked the country.
[08:37.000 --> 08:44.000]  I was talking to some pretty heavy hitters today about what's happening in DC and what's happening in Silicon Valley
[08:44.000 --> 08:53.000]  and happening in other areas of the nation and how the big banks behind the scenes openly are rooting to stop Trump
[08:53.000 --> 08:57.000]  and to shut down our infrastructure and to deindustrialize America.
[08:57.000 --> 09:08.000]  And then one of the astute people I was talking to, a very successful woman, very smart lady, who of course won't say her name,
[09:08.000 --> 09:14.000]  pointed out that that's what people can't stand anymore in the halls of power, is just the hatred of America.
[09:14.000 --> 09:19.000]  And it makes people who've never even really been political go, why do you hate America so bad?
[09:19.000 --> 09:21.000]  Why do you want to make everybody poor?
[09:21.000 --> 09:23.000]  Why do you root against the country?
[09:23.000 --> 09:34.000]  And this lady pointed out, she said, I listen all the time, but I notice you didn't talk about this a few weeks ago and you really should.
[09:34.000 --> 09:47.000]  And that's the fact that Goldman Sachs' head, who's never tweeted, suddenly has started going active with five tweets, Lloyd Blankfein,
[09:47.000 --> 09:52.000]  who if Hillary was president, Lloyd Blankfein would be president.
[09:52.000 --> 09:55.000]  Goldman Sachs is the most powerful institution in the world.
[09:55.000 --> 09:56.000]  It's the top of the pyramid.
[09:56.000 --> 09:58.000]  Right under that's J.P. Morgan.
[09:58.000 --> 09:59.000]  But it's the same group, basically.
[09:59.000 --> 10:01.000]  J.P. Morgan's British intelligence.
[10:01.000 --> 10:03.000]  At least that's what founded it.
[10:03.000 --> 10:12.000]  Goldman Sachs is a consortium of New York socialists and others that got together openly over 100 years ago and so they were going to take over banking.
[10:12.000 --> 10:22.000]  But I was reading his tweets where he makes fun of Trump and makes fun of Trump trying to reboot American infrastructure and says,
[10:22.000 --> 10:23.000]  China's is incredible.
[10:23.000 --> 10:24.000]  It's much better than ours.
[10:24.000 --> 10:27.000]  And I just got back from there.
[10:27.000 --> 10:30.000]  And you're going to fail, basically.
[10:30.000 --> 10:39.000]  Arrived in China as always impressed by condition of airport roads, cell service, except U.S. needs to invest in infrastructure to keep up.
[10:39.000 --> 10:41.000]  Then he makes a joke to Trump.
[10:41.000 --> 10:43.000]  How's infrastructure going for you there?
[10:43.000 --> 10:50.000]  Because the globalists have intended to sell us out to China and leverage us out.
[10:50.000 --> 10:52.000]  And that's why they don't want us to have cheap energy.
[10:52.000 --> 10:54.000]  That's why they don't want us to have factory jobs.
[10:54.000 --> 10:57.000]  That's why, because the globalist hate America.
[10:57.000 --> 11:02.000]  Hollywood hates America.
[11:02.000 --> 11:05.000]  And people are sick of it.
[11:05.000 --> 11:13.000]  And then you've got the leftist throngs on the street who are the most illiberal, anti-liberal people on the planet.
[11:13.000 --> 11:15.000]  These definitions mean nothing.
[11:15.000 --> 11:16.000]  They want control.
[11:16.000 --> 11:17.000]  They want to say what words you can use.
[11:17.000 --> 11:19.000]  They want to totally tax.
[11:19.000 --> 11:21.000]  They want people poor.
[11:21.000 --> 11:28.000]  The WikiLeaks are just full of the Democrat leaders talking about keeping the public in the dark and desperate and hopeless.
[11:28.000 --> 11:30.000]  Sounds like serial killers.
[11:30.000 --> 11:34.000]  You know, they've got kids locked up or something.
[11:34.000 --> 11:42.000]  And they're panicking because despite everything they've thrown at Trump and, you know, removing in the sample 9 to 15 points against him,
[11:42.000 --> 11:46.000]  he's got a 50% in the major Gallup poll.
[11:46.000 --> 11:50.000]  It means he's more like 60, 65 and they are scared.
[11:50.000 --> 11:54.000]  They're throwing everything they've got and it's failing.
[11:54.000 --> 11:56.000]  So here comes the conspiracy theory.
[11:56.000 --> 11:59.000]  Oh, it's not Russia collusion.
[11:59.000 --> 12:06.000]  No, the president obstructed justice, even though in the unitary executive he could basically do whatever he wanted,
[12:06.000 --> 12:10.000]  because he's only responsible to the voters.
[12:10.000 --> 12:18.000]  And Alan Dershowitz, the Democrat, is clear on that as long as he's not involved in sedition against the country.
[12:18.000 --> 12:26.000]  And then, of course, the Comey memo didn't have Trump in it obstructed.
[12:26.000 --> 12:30.000]  But see, they don't care.
[12:30.000 --> 12:33.000]  They're going to continue and they're hiring an army of lawyers.
[12:33.000 --> 12:41.000]  All of them basically Democrat operatives as the deep state prepares to try to bring down our president.
[12:41.000 --> 12:43.000]  They are the usurpers.
[12:43.000 --> 12:44.000]  They are the hijackers.
[12:44.000 --> 12:51.000]  And there's a battle over the wheel controlling the ship of state with the foreign outside globalists that openly have
[12:51.000 --> 12:56.000]  deindustrialized this nation to make us poor and to be able to control us and put us on welfare and run our lives.
[12:56.000 --> 13:00.000]  And they write white papers and textbooks on it, clowered in piven.
[13:00.000 --> 13:02.000]  They admit the whole thing.
[13:02.000 --> 13:07.000]  And then they come with their conspiracy theory that I'm commanding the Russians now.
[13:07.000 --> 13:10.000]  Remember Hillary two weeks ago?
[13:10.000 --> 13:13.000]  She said, oh, the Russians, they couldn't come up with this on their own.
[13:13.000 --> 13:18.000]  There's groups here in America that create the talking points, info wars,
[13:18.000 --> 13:25.000]  and then Putin has the bots attack and then coordinated info wars, then releases the information.
[13:25.000 --> 13:26.000]  Wow, lady.
[13:26.000 --> 13:27.000]  And you know what?
[13:27.000 --> 13:32.000]  In a way, it's true because I am creating the talking points, but I didn't.
[13:32.000 --> 13:33.000]  I didn't invent them.
[13:33.000 --> 13:38.000]  I just dug them up out of the ash heap of history that you thought was, you know, long gone and defeated.
[13:38.000 --> 13:41.000]  Classic Renaissance, classic Americana.
[13:41.000 --> 13:55.000]  And it's so sexy compared to what you're selling, austerity and race war and garbage and shooting cops in the back of the head and bringing any legals by the millions and not even testing them for diseases when it hurts them and us.
[13:55.000 --> 14:06.000]  I mean, you are a bunch of selfish, evil people that think being monsters is an art form and have convinced yourself because you hijacked our banking system and hijacked our industry
[14:06.000 --> 14:12.000]  and sold it out to parlay your power into global government.
[14:12.000 --> 14:22.000]  But now the world knows about your corporate world government and your carbon taxes and everyone's starting to resist it and your problems are going to get bigger and bigger by the minute.
[14:22.000 --> 14:26.000]  There's no putting the genie back in the bottle now.
[14:26.000 --> 14:31.000]  As Peter Thiel said, the tide of globalism is going out.
[14:31.000 --> 14:34.000]  You are swimming against the tide of history.
[14:34.000 --> 14:45.000]  There is a tide in the affairs of men when taken at the flood leads on to fortune, Julius Caesar.
[14:45.000 --> 14:48.000]  Shakespeare's Julius Caesar.
[14:48.000 --> 15:01.000]  And you see how they root against America in the New York Times and the Daily Beast saying, and the worst thing Alex Jones did is he put out a fake clip of Comey saying that the president never tried to influence him or nobody else did.
[15:01.000 --> 15:04.000]  And it's fake and then a stock market went up.
[15:04.000 --> 15:10.000]  We had it declining and it went up and we called the head of the NY stock market and they said it was Jones.
[15:10.000 --> 15:12.000]  It was a clip.
[15:12.000 --> 15:14.000]  He said, oh, that was fake.
[15:14.000 --> 15:17.000]  And these savages are so crazy.
[15:17.000 --> 15:30.000]  So out of control that if hijacked this nation that they think you're so stupid, they put out transcripts of what we aired and said it was fake.
[15:30.000 --> 15:32.000]  That's bold.
[15:32.000 --> 15:47.000]  And they say I'm fake news because they take the fact that we have wide discussions when my listeners almost lynched me when the Sandy Hook shootings took place because I didn't immediately jump on it and say it was a false flag.
[15:47.000 --> 15:49.000]  When we see evidence of false flag, we cover it.
[15:49.000 --> 15:50.000]  Was the media ready?
[15:50.000 --> 15:51.000]  Did they pounce on it?
[15:51.000 --> 15:52.000]  Did they blame gun owners?
[15:52.000 --> 16:05.000]  That's outrageous to blame our veterans that have fought for the Second Amendment and citizens and say that we're at fault for some Prozac head with a semi-automatic rifle reportedly going and shooting people.
[16:05.000 --> 16:13.000]  And then all the anomalies and the babies and the incubators being killed to take us to war and all the other fake things media has done.
[16:13.000 --> 16:15.000]  Of course people question that.
[16:15.000 --> 16:21.000]  Of course we question a government that's engaged in hoax after hoax after hoax.
[16:21.000 --> 16:26.000]  But that doesn't mean we hate people that have lost children in mass shootings once they're investigated.
[16:26.000 --> 16:36.000]  Now some of the families, I guess, really I think it's more like a law firm, the Democratic Party, they say they want to sue Megan Kelly for interviewing me.
[16:36.000 --> 16:37.000]  I'm so evil.
[16:37.000 --> 16:39.000]  You can interview Jeffrey Dahmer.
[16:39.000 --> 16:42.000]  You can interview Adolf Hitler in Time Magazine.
[16:42.000 --> 16:44.000]  You can interview Saddam Hussein.
[16:44.000 --> 16:47.000]  But you don't interview Alex Jones.
[16:47.000 --> 16:48.000]  And why is that?
[16:48.000 --> 16:57.000]  Because they fear us so much that they don't want people to even see me so they might actually come here what I actually have to say.
[16:57.000 --> 16:58.000]  But what a joke.
[16:58.000 --> 17:02.000]  We don't need the platform of this show.
[17:02.000 --> 17:07.000]  This firestorm is a hundred times bigger, 200 times than the show.
[17:07.000 --> 17:19.000]  And they meant to destroy us and set a precedent to go out to free speech and say, you know, there's the Alex Jones standard and it's so bad that, you know, it's just speech that is illegal.
[17:19.000 --> 17:26.000]  And then they build a straw man of what I've said so they can crucify me on lies.
[17:26.000 --> 17:30.000]  And remember when they can crucify me politically, they can crucify you.
[17:30.000 --> 17:32.000]  And that's what this is all about.
[17:32.000 --> 17:33.000]  It's about destroying Trump.
[17:33.000 --> 17:34.000]  It's about destroying Americana.
[17:34.000 --> 17:39.000]  It's about destroying the American reboot that's here and happening now.
[17:39.000 --> 17:41.000]  Prosperity versus austerity.
[17:41.000 --> 17:43.000]  Freedom versus slavery.
[17:43.000 --> 17:46.000]  And the choice is up to you.
[17:46.000 --> 17:48.000]  I'm not one that really hypes things up.
[17:48.000 --> 17:55.000]  I always just start giving you the news up right up front, but we will be at the bottom of the hour skipping the 50 break for stations out there.
[17:55.000 --> 17:56.000]  That's a network break.
[17:56.000 --> 17:59.000]  So nobody should nobody should play their ads there.
[17:59.000 --> 18:06.000]  We're going to air the 27 minute piece that Rob do put together of just part of phone calls with Megan Kelly.
[18:06.000 --> 18:09.000]  And then yes, we do have the interview.
[18:09.000 --> 18:13.000]  We do have at least one portion of it.
[18:13.000 --> 18:20.000]  The two hours almost they interviewed me at some house in the Texas Hill Country some CIA substation.
[18:20.000 --> 18:23.000]  And I'm not joking when I say that it was just spook central.
[18:23.000 --> 18:27.000]  This is a total deep state operation against myself against Trump.
[18:27.000 --> 18:32.000]  It's a level of propaganda roll out like you see before a major war because it is a war.
[18:32.000 --> 18:33.000]  It's a war on America.
[18:33.000 --> 18:34.000]  It's a war on you.
[18:34.000 --> 18:36.000]  It's a war on prosperity.
[18:36.000 --> 18:39.000]  It's a it's a it's a war on freedom.
[18:39.000 --> 18:42.000]  It is a war to promote racism and division.
[18:42.000 --> 18:45.000]  They're all over the news saying yes, it is a civil war.
[18:45.000 --> 18:50.000]  Hashtag hunt Republicans and top Democratic strategists are saying let's go.
[18:50.000 --> 18:52.000]  Let's start killing.
[18:52.000 --> 18:56.000]  And they believe we're all going to roll over to the political correctness.
[18:56.000 --> 19:00.000]  Well, Blitzer, you know, has guests on going.
[19:00.000 --> 19:01.000]  He wasn't evil.
[19:01.000 --> 19:02.000]  He was just upset.
[19:02.000 --> 19:04.000]  Well, Bush was like, yep, not one of the guy.
[19:04.000 --> 19:05.000]  That's right.
[19:05.000 --> 19:07.000]  Yeah, we'll shoot that Congressman still fight for his life.
[19:07.000 --> 19:08.000]  Shoot a couple cops.
[19:08.000 --> 19:09.000]  Shoot some other people.
[19:09.000 --> 19:10.000]  Just just just your opinion.
[19:10.000 --> 19:11.000]  Yeah, okay.
[19:11.000 --> 19:20.000]  They're the ones calling for violence and they turn around and say that I mean, it's almost like I killed the kids at Newtown.
[19:20.000 --> 19:21.000]  I killed the kids.
[19:21.000 --> 19:23.000]  Am I right?
[19:23.000 --> 19:27.000]  I'm the reason kids are coming across from Mexico with tuberculosis and leprosy.
[19:27.000 --> 19:30.000]  Hell, didn't you know there's a new name for Satan?
[19:30.000 --> 19:35.000]  It's Alexander M. Jones, the name of the devil himself.
[19:35.000 --> 19:49.000]  According to the fake media that lied to you about WMDs and the millions of dead Iraqis swallowed into oblivion and turned over to radical Islamists because people like Tom Brokaw assisted in the lie that led to the mass murder.
[19:49.000 --> 19:56.000]  That swallower of millions of souls, that cheerleader of death calls me a quote, total racist.
[19:56.000 --> 20:01.000]  No, Tom Brokaw, you have been reporting fake news since the Hindenburg.
[20:01.000 --> 20:05.000]  Hi, this is Ron Paul, former Congressman and Republican presidential candidate.
[20:05.000 --> 20:13.000]  I love these summer months because this is when I get to enjoy the fresh fruits and vegetables that are being harvested on small farms and in our backyards.
[20:13.000 --> 20:16.000]  We all look forward to garden tomatoes and corn on the cob.
[20:16.000 --> 20:20.000]  Don't you wish there was a better way to preserve their true taste and flavors?
[20:20.000 --> 20:23.000]  I'm here to tell you that there is a better way.
[20:23.000 --> 20:27.000]  It's by using the amazing home freeze dryer from Harvest Right.
[20:27.000 --> 20:31.000]  I have a Harvest Right freeze dryer and use it to preserve the foods I love.
[20:31.000 --> 20:36.000]  Strawberries, apples, and even lasagna and ice cream can stay fresh for 25 years.
[20:36.000 --> 20:42.000]  And the best part of my freeze drying is my family and I have a supply of long lasting food on hand.
[20:42.000 --> 20:45.000]  So no matter what may come, we feel better prepared.
[20:45.000 --> 20:47.000]  We love our freeze dryer.
[20:47.000 --> 20:53.000]  To learn more, go to HarvestRight.com or call 800-923-9591.
[20:53.000 --> 20:59.000]  That's HarvestRight.com or 800-923-9591.
[21:01.000 --> 21:04.000]  Let's go to Devin in Florida. Devin in Florida, you're on the air.
[21:04.000 --> 21:06.000]  Great. Hey, thank you so much.
[21:06.000 --> 21:11.000]  Listen, I have bought your product and I got to say they're amazing.
[21:11.000 --> 21:19.000]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it because I've got cave-in, superman vitality, secret swell, climate-miner fusion.
[21:19.000 --> 21:21.000]  I've got the body armor.
[21:21.000 --> 21:24.000]  Wow, thank you. You're the type of listener that makes them all possible.
[21:24.000 --> 21:26.000]  Which nutraceutical does you like best?
[21:26.000 --> 21:29.000]  I really like the vitamin mineral fusion, to be honest.
[21:29.000 --> 21:30.000]  That's amazing.
[21:30.000 --> 21:31.000]  That's really incredible.
[21:31.000 --> 21:34.000]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[21:34.000 --> 21:38.000]  My morning was fantastic and I love you guys.
[21:38.000 --> 21:47.000]  I love the info wars crew and I just want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it.
[21:47.000 --> 21:50.000]  You will love it. I'm telling you, I've never bought a bad product.
[21:50.000 --> 21:55.000]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at infowarslife.com.
[21:55.000 --> 22:09.000]  It's the win-win infowarslife.com.
[22:25.000 --> 22:29.000]  That's libertyoncall.org.
[22:56.000 --> 23:03.000]  It's been said, any society has only three missed meals away from chaos.
[23:03.000 --> 23:05.000]  Those times may be near.
[23:05.000 --> 23:10.000]  Think about it, our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia and North Korea.
[23:10.000 --> 23:15.000]  Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns.
[23:15.000 --> 23:21.000]  And our crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages from a single cyber attack.
[23:21.000 --> 23:28.000]  When the chaos from any one of these threats arises, the government knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency.
[23:28.000 --> 23:31.000]  That's why you need your own plan for self-reliance.
[23:31.000 --> 23:34.000]  That's where My Patriot Supply comes in.

[24:04.000 --> 24:06.000]  Alex Jones here back live.
[24:06.000 --> 24:08.000]  Coming up when we kick off the next segment,
[24:08.000 --> 24:17.000]  I'm going to have time enough to air about 90% of the exclusive behind-the-scenes Megan Kelly leaked interview.
[24:17.000 --> 24:28.000]  And I love how NBC and others are talking about suing me while they've got reportedly some law firm that represents some of the families starting to sue Megan Kelly.
[24:28.000 --> 24:33.000]  If she puts this interview out, it's amazing.
[24:33.000 --> 24:36.000]  That would be the end of the First Amendment.
[24:36.000 --> 24:42.000]  Kelly was always doing a vicious, deceptive, investigative report.
[24:42.000 --> 24:44.000]  60-minute style.
[24:44.000 --> 24:50.000]  Her flagging failed career, her tank ratings on Fox, her tanking ratings on NBC,
[24:50.000 --> 24:54.000]  is emblematic of the whole dinosaur media collapsing.
[24:54.000 --> 24:57.000]  So she wanted to rehabilitate herself.
[24:57.000 --> 24:59.000]  And she was totally fake.
[24:59.000 --> 25:01.000]  On the phone, I knew it was fake.
[25:01.000 --> 25:02.000]  I told her she was being fake.
[25:02.000 --> 25:04.000]  You can hear me say that to her.
[25:04.000 --> 25:06.000]  And I kind of polished the app a little bit too.
[25:06.000 --> 25:08.000]  You know, I said, oh yeah, I'm a fan of yours.
[25:08.000 --> 25:12.000]  And she wasn't bad at news reading, you know, six, seven years ago.
[25:12.000 --> 25:16.000]  I didn't dislike Megan Kelly.
[25:16.000 --> 25:21.000]  But the reason it's important is they've thrown everything they can against me,
[25:21.000 --> 25:26.000]  and even MSM admits it's all blown up in their face at every point.
[25:26.000 --> 25:30.000]  And they've got all these articles saying Jones is the master media tactician.
[25:30.000 --> 25:33.000]  No, I'm not.
[25:33.000 --> 25:35.000]  I go into this with an open heart.
[25:35.000 --> 25:40.000]  And I just trust in God.
[25:40.000 --> 25:42.000]  So it's more like sleepwalking.
[25:42.000 --> 25:48.000]  It's not, you know, I didn't say the things they said the way I said them about Sandy Hook.
[25:48.000 --> 25:50.000]  I'm not the man they say I am.
[25:50.000 --> 25:51.000]  I know who I am.
[25:51.000 --> 25:52.000]  I care.
[25:52.000 --> 25:53.000]  And I do my research.
[25:53.000 --> 25:54.000]  And I try to tell the truth.
[25:54.000 --> 25:58.000]  And it's hard to know the truth on things when you're dealing with the media
[25:58.000 --> 26:00.000]  and a government that lies so much.
[26:00.000 --> 26:02.000]  They're the reason.
[26:02.000 --> 26:05.000]  We can't believe anything comes out of MSM because they've lied so much.
[26:05.000 --> 26:09.000]  And they want to turn that around and say I'm the liar and they want to destroy me.
[26:09.000 --> 26:15.000]  And so many people think the safe move in the world is to ride the fence and to go along to get along.
[26:15.000 --> 26:16.000]  That leads to stagnation.
[26:16.000 --> 26:17.000]  That leads to destruction.
[26:17.000 --> 26:21.000]  That leads to North Korea.
[26:21.000 --> 26:24.000]  I want to be somebody that changes the world for better.
[26:24.000 --> 26:25.000]  I want to be attacked by scum.
[26:25.000 --> 26:28.000]  I want to take them on.
[26:28.000 --> 26:33.000]  I want to change the world and I'm doing it because of your support and your prayers.
[26:33.000 --> 26:38.000]  So again, I want to encourage listeners, spread the word, spread the article, spread the videos.
[26:38.000 --> 26:41.000]  The enemy won't even quote me in the news.
[26:41.000 --> 26:48.000]  They won't even say what I'm actually saying in almost all these publications
[26:48.000 --> 26:53.000]  because they want to build that straw man to project it onto you.
[26:53.000 --> 26:56.000]  Just like they project mass shootings that are getting more and more rare.
[26:56.000 --> 26:58.000]  They're actually down from the 90s.
[26:58.000 --> 27:03.000]  One of the rarest forms of death is a diamond mass shooting and most of them are gang related and it's terrible.
[27:03.000 --> 27:10.000]  But it's very rare and they're projecting that on the gun owners and veterans and patriots and we shouldn't put up with that.
[27:10.000 --> 27:13.000]  Law abiding gun owners make the crime rate go down.
[27:13.000 --> 27:15.000]  Concealed carry makes the crime rate go down.
[27:15.000 --> 27:19.000]  We're tired of your boycotts, your harassment, your bullying.
[27:19.000 --> 27:24.000]  I've got a stack of news here with top Democrats everywhere saying hunt Republicans, kill, civil war.
[27:24.000 --> 27:26.000]  Now's the time.
[27:26.000 --> 27:28.000]  Huffington Post, you name it.
[27:28.000 --> 27:30.000]  So many of these articles, I can't even keep track of them.
[27:30.000 --> 27:32.000]  They're on infowars.com.
[27:32.000 --> 27:34.000]  Hashtag hunt Republicans.
[27:34.000 --> 27:36.000]  Them strategist calls for civil war.
[27:36.000 --> 27:38.000]  They're the violent.
[27:38.000 --> 27:40.000]  They're the hateful.
[27:40.000 --> 27:50.000]  Think of the arrogance for three years going out to Black Lives Matter events with a bunch of Soros financed white college folks getting off the buses
[27:50.000 --> 27:55.000]  and going around saying, you know, deck the halls with dead cops, kill cops, kill cops.
[27:55.000 --> 27:58.000]  And the cops just sit there while someone says kill cops, kill cops.
[27:58.000 --> 28:00.000]  That's not free speech. That's a call to action.
[28:00.000 --> 28:08.000]  And now they got communists with machine guns walking around with semi-automatic threatening to kill people in Austin and nothing's done.
[28:08.000 --> 28:15.000]  They're sitting there talking about killing people with their finger on the trigger, but they want law abiding citizens guns.
[28:15.000 --> 28:25.000]  I am amazed by the restraint of conservatives and patriots and Christians of Hollywood everywhere trying to sexualize children.
[28:25.000 --> 28:31.000]  Trying to push a war.
[28:31.000 --> 28:37.000]  And then they roll out some mercenary like Megan Kelly.
[28:37.000 --> 28:48.000]  When she wears her establishment crown like it's a crown and really it's like a bag of rotting meat hung over her.
[28:48.000 --> 28:50.000]  These people are a joke.
[28:50.000 --> 28:53.000]  Their whole system's going out. A whole new system's coming in.
[28:53.000 --> 28:56.000]  I want to affect the system so it's a better world.
[28:56.000 --> 28:59.000]  Prosperity. That's what Trump wants. And that's why the elites hate him.
[28:59.000 --> 29:12.000]  Almost 30% profits up for Goldman Sachs and they want Trump out so bad even though he has reigned money on them with the exuberance and then the positivity and the outlook and the jobs.
[29:12.000 --> 29:14.000]  And what has MSM done?
[29:14.000 --> 29:16.000]  Tried to push everything they can to kill confidence.
[29:16.000 --> 29:21.000]  And then Lloyd Blaine has made horrible statements about the president because he wants to be the unelected president.
[29:21.000 --> 29:23.000]  And he wants to decide who gets the money.
[29:23.000 --> 29:27.000]  He doesn't want 30% more this year in record profit for Goldman Sachs.
[29:27.000 --> 29:30.000]  He wants to say he almost has no profit.
[29:30.000 --> 29:38.000]  Write it all off in offshore corporations and make sure you're bankrupt so he can buy everything up and make you live in a 200 foot square foot coffin apartment.
[29:38.000 --> 29:41.000]  Because Lloyd Blaine likes watching you squirm.
[29:41.000 --> 29:45.000]  He gets off on it. He's a scumbag. He hates America.
[29:45.000 --> 29:48.000]  He hates Donald Trump. And he hates me.
[29:48.000 --> 29:50.000]  Well guess what? You want to fight? You got one.
[29:50.000 --> 29:52.000]  The March. The Empire's on the rise.
[29:52.000 --> 29:53.000]  The interview's coming up.
[29:53.000 --> 29:54.000]  Alex Jones.
[29:54.000 --> 29:57.000]  You're going to hear her duplicates from Radio Network.
[29:57.000 --> 30:01.000]  You're going to hear her promising it wasn't a hit piece. You're going to hear her lies.
[30:01.000 --> 30:10.000]  Following the liberal outcry over Megyn Kelly interviewing Alex Jones, NBC News executives have been scrambling to further edit their hit piece on Alex Jones.
[30:10.000 --> 30:22.000]  The word now is that Megyn Kelly has changed her Sunday night show featuring Alex Jones' interview by inviting Sandy Hook Families on to play edited clips of Alex talking while they have the parents emotionally respond.
[30:22.000 --> 30:29.000]  One thing is for sure with how long it's taking NBC to edit making Kelly's interview with Alex Jones prior to just airing it.
[30:29.000 --> 30:34.000]  We can expect that they will be misrepresenting his statements with skilled editing techniques.
[30:34.000 --> 30:39.000]  Why not just release the entire interview unedited and prove you're not fake news, NBC?
[30:39.000 --> 30:48.000]  They'd like you to believe that Alex Jones, not Adam Lanza, is the real bad guy in the Sandy Hook Massacre because he said he believes there was a government conspiracy at work.
[30:48.000 --> 30:58.000]  However, all of this will backfire on the mainstream media as everyday Americans are increasingly becoming more aware of the staging, faking and lying that is the mainstream media.
[30:58.000 --> 31:27.000]  For more reports go to infowars.com.
[31:28.000 --> 31:30.000]  These are the best jobs you can to purify your air.
[31:30.000 --> 31:38.000]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most toxic effects for themselves.
[31:38.000 --> 31:40.000]  The general public doesn't.
[31:40.000 --> 31:44.000]  The elects of pure breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[31:44.000 --> 31:48.000]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[31:48.000 --> 31:54.000]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[31:54.000 --> 32:00.000]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at infowarsstore.com.
[32:24.000 --> 32:31.000]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[32:31.000 --> 32:44.000]  Now in 2016 even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[32:44.000 --> 32:46.000]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[32:46.000 --> 32:55.000]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential in my view to any optimum health regimen.
[32:55.000 --> 33:22.000]  For more information, visit infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[33:22.000 --> 33:26.000]  From the front lines.
[33:26.000 --> 33:38.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[33:38.000 --> 33:46.000]  A new world order.
[33:46.000 --> 33:52.000]  Why we stand here idle, my friends, when the war has already begun?
[33:52.000 --> 33:58.000]  I know not which course others may take, but as for me, give me liberty or give me death.
[33:58.000 --> 34:02.000]  Hey, if you don't want to join us in this fight, as Patrick Henry said, that's fine.
[34:02.000 --> 34:12.000]  May your chains set lightly upon you, and may you forget that we were your brethren.
[34:12.000 --> 34:23.000]  What you do when you turn your back on your heritage, your republic, your greatness, your birthright, you forget who your brethren are.
[34:23.000 --> 34:32.000]  You give away the greatest thing you've ever had, your lineage, and what your ancestors did from every corner of the world to try to live a better life.
[34:32.000 --> 34:42.000]  And now to have a bunch of monsters, like Lloyd Blankfein, using weaponized media to try to destroy our president and destroy our recovery and the reboot of America.
[34:42.000 --> 34:49.000]  Now I'm going to air about 20 minutes of the 27 minute behind the scenes with Megan Kelly, and then we do have the big bulk of the interview.
[34:49.000 --> 34:56.000]  She interviewed me here in the studio off and on for several hours, and then also at a barbecue place.
[34:56.000 --> 35:08.000]  But that was all just to lull me into a false sense of security, get me out at some hot box, you know, house in the Hill Country at 9 o'clock at night to start shooting.
[35:08.000 --> 35:12.000]  End at about 1045.
[35:12.000 --> 35:17.000]  Well, we got that interview, and NBC's running around saying, we don't know if we're going to sue Jones.
[35:17.000 --> 35:20.000]  Well, you know, let me explain something to you how this works.
[35:20.000 --> 35:22.000]  I'm not a very litigious person.
[35:22.000 --> 35:29.000]  I need to call my lawyers before I did this, but I already see the legal experts out there agreeing with me because I'm in the media.
[35:29.000 --> 35:30.000]  I've studied this.
[35:30.000 --> 35:32.000]  Texas is a one party consent state.
[35:32.000 --> 35:35.000]  The state she was in at the time was the one party consent state.
[35:35.000 --> 35:41.000]  And she was making warranties to me that this was a profile and not a hit piece.
[35:41.000 --> 35:51.000]  And I knew she was in bed with a Sandy Hook Bloomberg anti gun PR machine that he's admittedly put over $100 million just into that alone.
[35:51.000 --> 35:58.000]  Using the families or folks really heart goes out to them that understand what they're in the middle of.
[35:58.000 --> 36:02.000]  They're being used as a weapon to try to destroy the Second Amendment.
[36:02.000 --> 36:04.000]  They can always bring it back, bring it back, bring it back.
[36:04.000 --> 36:13.000]  They're being used by Bloomberg and, you know, dark crystal skexies like Megan Kelly.
[36:13.000 --> 36:16.000]  And I'm sad for them.
[36:16.000 --> 36:24.000]  And I'm sad that the government lied about babies being murdered and incubators and to bring us to war to kill millions of people total with sanctions that the Democrats accelerated.
[36:24.000 --> 36:28.000]  And that they say it's a great thing, 500,000 kids just in a few years of sanctions.
[36:28.000 --> 36:32.000]  That's real news.
[36:32.000 --> 36:33.000]  That's real murder.
[36:33.000 --> 36:38.000]  Not Tom Brokaw saying I'm a quote unalloyed racist.
[36:38.000 --> 36:39.000]  That means total.
[36:39.000 --> 36:42.000]  That means complete in Webster's dictionary.
[36:42.000 --> 36:44.000]  Can we pull up unalloyed?
[36:44.000 --> 36:46.000]  I'm going from memory.
[36:46.000 --> 36:50.000]  I believe it means total or absolute will will.
[36:50.000 --> 36:52.000]  Well, it means pure.
[36:52.000 --> 36:56.000]  I am a pure racist.
[36:56.000 --> 36:59.000]  Pure, complete and unreserved.
[36:59.000 --> 37:02.000]  That's why they have no clips of me saying anything racist.
[37:02.000 --> 37:10.000]  Imagine the level of fake news of a Tom Brokaw.
[37:10.000 --> 37:17.000]  To go on NBC.
[37:17.000 --> 37:22.000]  I mean, this guy was around when the Hindenburg went down and to blurp out.
[37:22.000 --> 37:25.000]  I'm a pure racist.
[37:25.000 --> 37:28.000]  I mean, talk about fake news.
[37:28.000 --> 37:31.000]  Hey, bro, show the clip.
[37:31.000 --> 37:32.000]  But they just do it.
[37:32.000 --> 37:33.000]  Oh, you don't like Obamacare.
[37:33.000 --> 37:34.000]  You're a racist.
[37:34.000 --> 37:36.000]  Oh, you don't like Hillary.
[37:36.000 --> 37:38.000]  You're you're you hate women.
[37:38.000 --> 37:41.000]  These people are just throwing everything they've got.
[37:41.000 --> 37:43.000]  And now I've seen headlines.
[37:43.000 --> 37:47.000]  Jones this morning.
[37:47.000 --> 37:53.000]  Murdered children.
[37:53.000 --> 37:54.000]  That was a headline.
[37:54.000 --> 37:55.000]  I saw a minute.
[37:55.000 --> 37:56.000]  I need to read later.
[37:56.000 --> 37:58.000]  The subheadline would be murdered children.
[37:58.000 --> 37:59.000]  Denier.
[37:59.000 --> 38:00.000]  But no, no, I see.
[38:00.000 --> 38:01.000]  I murdered the children.
[38:01.000 --> 38:02.000]  Did you know that?
[38:02.000 --> 38:05.000]  Well, I don't know why they're saying NBC should narrow it.
[38:05.000 --> 38:07.000]  I mean, we interview other people like Jones.
[38:07.000 --> 38:13.000]  You know, child molesters, murderers, dictators.
[38:13.000 --> 38:15.000]  Oh, he's so evil, though.
[38:15.000 --> 38:17.000]  We can't show you what he's saying.
[38:17.000 --> 38:21.000]  We're just going to tell you that he went and harassed the families of the
[38:21.000 --> 38:22.000]  of the dead children.
[38:22.000 --> 38:23.000]  And he hates the children.
[38:23.000 --> 38:28.000]  Just lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, more lies.
[38:28.000 --> 38:33.000]  Jones says the firefighters and police blew up the World Trade Center.
[38:33.000 --> 38:34.000]  Really?
[38:34.000 --> 38:35.000]  Where's the clip of that?
[38:35.000 --> 38:39.000]  Like Colbert played this clip with a little bitty TV behind him.
[38:39.000 --> 38:46.000]  So that you couldn't see it was edited where it had me saying.
[38:46.000 --> 38:47.000]  I'm against gay people.
[38:47.000 --> 38:49.000]  No, I said I'm not against gay people.
[38:49.000 --> 38:51.000]  I mean.
[38:51.000 --> 38:52.000]  But they've already been caught lying.
[38:52.000 --> 38:55.000]  So all they do is triple down with more lies.
[38:55.000 --> 38:59.000]  And then Rachel Maddow and people saying Jones is deeply racist.
[38:59.000 --> 39:02.000]  MSNBC is the talking point because he doesn't like Obamacare.
[39:02.000 --> 39:07.000]  See, not liking Obamacare is deeply racist deeply, deeply.
[39:07.000 --> 39:12.000]  But I've gone from deeply to pure.
[39:12.000 --> 39:16.000]  I guess they haven't checked with the Nazi sites and the new Black Panther sites.
[39:16.000 --> 39:20.000]  I mean, it seems like every racist organization hates my guts because I want to
[39:20.000 --> 39:25.000]  unify people around Americana, around free market, around prosperity.
[39:25.000 --> 39:30.000]  I don't feel good when I see poor white people or poor black people or anybody else.
[39:30.000 --> 39:31.000]  It makes me feel small.
[39:31.000 --> 39:32.000]  I want prosperity.
[39:32.000 --> 39:33.000]  I'm a classical liberal.
[39:33.000 --> 39:34.000]  I like Thomas Jefferson.
[39:34.000 --> 39:36.000]  I've actually read the writings.
[39:36.000 --> 39:37.000]  I've actually read his work.
[39:37.000 --> 39:38.000]  I actually like him.
[39:38.000 --> 39:39.000]  I admire him.
[39:39.000 --> 39:40.000]  I believe in him.
[39:40.000 --> 39:43.000]  I believe I'm carrying on part of that great shared destiny.
[39:43.000 --> 39:45.000]  And I want you to join me in that destiny.
[39:45.000 --> 39:48.000]  I'm going to go to the Megan Kelly.
[39:48.000 --> 39:51.000]  Prelude, the hors d'oeuvre, the intro.
[39:51.000 --> 39:54.000]  And then when they release their piece, we'll see what they did.
[39:54.000 --> 39:55.000]  I mean, I know what she did.
[39:55.000 --> 39:58.000]  She'd just stop and then do zingers like I'd just been caught.
[39:58.000 --> 40:02.000]  Like, you're blaming the people at the Pulse nightclub?
[40:02.000 --> 40:04.000]  You say gays deserve to die.
[40:04.000 --> 40:06.000]  And I'd be like, I didn't say that.
[40:06.000 --> 40:12.000]  I said, why do liberals say bring in radical Muslims when they kill gay people in every
[40:12.000 --> 40:13.000]  Muslim country?
[40:13.000 --> 40:15.000]  It's a death sentence.
[40:15.000 --> 40:17.000]  I'm saying, I don't want to kill.
[40:17.000 --> 40:19.000]  See, that's how they do this.
[40:19.000 --> 40:23.000]  But she'll just say, you say the kids deserve to die at Manchester.
[40:23.000 --> 40:25.000]  I never said that, lady.
[40:25.000 --> 40:27.000]  I said, why'd the left bring in these Muslims?
[40:27.000 --> 40:30.000]  They've had three high rises now burned down the last three days.
[40:30.000 --> 40:31.000]  It's Ramadan.
[40:31.000 --> 40:32.000]  It's fire bombs.
[40:32.000 --> 40:33.000]  The Muslims are celebrating it.
[40:33.000 --> 40:35.000]  But the media won't even tell you that.
[40:35.000 --> 40:38.000]  Scotland Yard knows it's starting to come out now.
[40:38.000 --> 40:43.000]  The Muslims are burning down high rises and even burning down high rises full of Muslims
[40:43.000 --> 40:47.000]  because they don't care.
[40:47.000 --> 40:52.000]  The Poles in Europe are between 25 and 40% depending on the poll.
[40:52.000 --> 41:01.000]  Now pollsters at their doors, they want to jihad and support suicide bombers.
[41:01.000 --> 41:06.000]  And now England has imported people that are running around burning everything down.
[41:06.000 --> 41:12.000]  I showed the skyscraper that burned three days ago.
[41:12.000 --> 41:14.000]  Notice it didn't collapse like building seven.
[41:14.000 --> 41:19.000]  So let me, let me get to this piece, but just briefly, if you are not financially supporting
[41:19.000 --> 41:23.000]  Info Wars, getting great products, you already need, you're insane.
[41:23.000 --> 41:27.000]  I know only a fraction of our listeners and God love them by the products.
[41:27.000 --> 41:29.000]  I mean, X2, the good halogen changed my life.
[41:29.000 --> 41:35.000]  Most people can't absorb iodine or it's a bound type that's tied in or comes from seaweed.
[41:35.000 --> 41:36.000]  This is from deep breath crystals.
[41:36.000 --> 41:37.000]  It's pure.
[41:37.000 --> 41:38.000]  It's in palm oil.
[41:38.000 --> 41:39.000]  It changed my life.
[41:39.000 --> 41:42.000]  I did detox in about three weeks into it though.
[41:42.000 --> 41:46.000]  And you should consult your medical provider before you take it because it's serious.
[41:46.000 --> 41:49.000]  0.9 stars from power reviews.
[41:49.000 --> 41:52.000]  Nobody's got that 4,000 plus reviews.
[41:52.000 --> 41:55.000]  X2 is available.
[41:55.000 --> 41:59.000]  It's discounted right now, even though it's about to sell out yet again and we are having
[41:59.000 --> 42:02.000]  more and more trouble actually procuring the deep breath crystal source, but I believe we're
[42:02.000 --> 42:03.000]  going to be able to get more of it.
[42:03.000 --> 42:07.000]  But group is running down on this and it was folks trying to shut off our supply of some
[42:07.000 --> 42:11.000]  of the cleanest seaweed based up a few years ago that ended up letting us get in touch
[42:11.000 --> 42:15.000]  with the oil companies that run into this very rarely.
[42:15.000 --> 42:16.000]  It's a specialty.
[42:16.000 --> 42:19.000]  You got to pay them a lot to be able to even extract it when they go through it because
[42:19.000 --> 42:21.000]  they're going to the gas and oil that's deeper generally.
[42:21.000 --> 42:27.000]  This comes from between 7 and 12,000 feet deep drilling and it comes out pure crystals
[42:27.000 --> 42:28.000]  and they're so explosive.
[42:28.000 --> 42:29.000]  It's like alien blood.
[42:29.000 --> 42:34.000]  It eats through concrete that it has to be kept in special DEA certified facilities.
[42:34.000 --> 42:41.000]  Then with proprietary Russian technology, oh my gosh we're Russian agents now, it's then
[42:41.000 --> 42:48.000]  injected in a gas into the palm oil and it's then stabilized, but it is the real deal because
[42:48.000 --> 42:51.000]  it's so highly controlled because you can do so much with pure iodine.
[42:51.000 --> 42:52.000]  Not once it's in the palm oil.
[42:52.000 --> 42:54.000]  It's why the DEA authorizes it.
[42:54.000 --> 42:59.000]  This is really special and again enemy attacks led us to this, this breakthrough.
[42:59.000 --> 43:04.000]  So infowarstore.com, infowarslife.com or AAA-253-3139.
[43:04.000 --> 43:08.000]  I should add we've got store wide free shipping in the next week.
[43:08.000 --> 43:09.000]  That is a big deal.
[43:09.000 --> 43:15.000]  You sign up for auto ship, additional 10% off, infowarslife.com or AAA-253-3139.
[43:15.000 --> 43:20.000]  But whether it's Biotrusillinium or whether it's our nanotechnology body armor developed
[43:20.000 --> 43:24.000]  right here in Texas, first available to info warriors that military and law enforcement
[43:24.000 --> 43:25.000]  use, it's all there.
[43:25.000 --> 43:29.000]  Info wars, bound defense, high quality probiotic.
[43:29.000 --> 43:32.000]  That's available infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com.
[43:32.000 --> 43:39.000]  Again, we have a bound defense with the 50 billion live active strains in it.
[43:39.000 --> 43:40.000]  Amazing.
[43:40.000 --> 43:42.000]  Repopulate your gut with the good bacteria.
[43:42.000 --> 43:48.000]  Get 25% off right now on Biotrusillinium with X-tube, super blue fluoride free toothpaste,
[43:48.000 --> 43:50.000]  colloidal silver and iodine.
[43:50.000 --> 43:54.000]  Super high quality is now back in stock available as well.
[43:54.000 --> 43:57.000]  Got tea tree oil and more.
[43:57.000 --> 44:02.000]  Again, as I mentioned, survival shield X-tube and Biotrusillinium 25% off together.
[44:02.000 --> 44:03.000]  Take advantage today.
[44:03.000 --> 44:04.000]  Liver shield's about to sell out.
[44:04.000 --> 44:07.000]  So I was asking the crew, why is it 20% off?
[44:07.000 --> 44:08.000]  Well, whatever.
[44:08.000 --> 44:09.000]  We're going to keep it there until it sells out.
[44:09.000 --> 44:13.000]  It takes sometimes six months to get liver shield, a great known concentrated herbs that
[44:13.000 --> 44:14.000]  detoxify the body.
[44:14.000 --> 44:15.000]  That's available.
[44:15.000 --> 44:19.000]  You can get it discounted with the oxy powder as well and flush out your upper and lower
[44:19.000 --> 44:20.000]  intestines.
[44:20.000 --> 44:21.000]  It's dramatic.
[44:21.000 --> 44:23.000]  You can read about the gallbladder cleanses as well.
[44:23.000 --> 44:26.000]  Instructional videos on infowars.com, infowarslife.com.
[44:26.000 --> 44:27.000]  Brainforce Plus.
[44:27.000 --> 44:29.000]  Now, 20% more is back in stock as well.
[44:29.000 --> 44:32.000]  I know about the Neutropic.
[44:32.000 --> 44:38.000]  We've also introduced the new line, the first of six from Emmerich Essentials, a national
[44:38.000 --> 44:41.000]  brand, one of the top three in the country at Whole Foods.
[44:41.000 --> 44:42.000]  The owner is a patron.
[44:42.000 --> 44:44.000]  He lets his private label it with the same packaging even.
[44:44.000 --> 44:46.000]  We just changed the name to Emmerich Essentials.
[44:46.000 --> 44:47.000]  20% off retail on average.
[44:47.000 --> 44:50.000]  25% off on auto-ship on that because I want to introduce you to that.
[44:50.000 --> 44:54.000]  But I'm going to end that 25% off on auto-ship because we really don't even really make any
[44:54.000 --> 44:55.000]  money at that price.
[44:55.000 --> 44:57.000]  This is shampoo.
[44:57.000 --> 44:59.000]  It's like $18 at Whole Foods.
[44:59.000 --> 45:02.000]  We're selling it for $12 and you get the discount.
[45:02.000 --> 45:03.000]  It's like $9.
[45:03.000 --> 45:05.000]  You just can't beat that.
[45:05.000 --> 45:07.000]  The deodorant, everybody says, I recognize that label.
[45:07.000 --> 45:09.000]  That's like the top deodorant in the country.
[45:09.000 --> 45:10.000]  Yeah.
[45:10.000 --> 45:19.000]  I mean, the deodorant is arguably the top national brand of organic aluminum-free, metal-free.
[45:19.000 --> 45:23.000]  So that item right there has whole end caps at stores.
[45:23.000 --> 45:27.000]  And it is discounted at infowarstore.com under my middle name, Emmerich Essentials.
[45:27.000 --> 45:29.000]  So take advantage of that.
[45:29.000 --> 45:30.000]  But I am ending it next week.
[45:30.000 --> 45:32.000]  I'm going to end the 25% off and go to 10% off.
[45:32.000 --> 45:34.000]  So take advantage of Emmerich Essentials.
[45:34.000 --> 45:38.000]  I wanted to give our most die-hard fans and listeners that fund this operation that are
[45:38.000 --> 45:42.000]  the Info War the first shot at getting 25% off.
[45:42.000 --> 45:44.000]  You can cancel any time on auto-ship.
[45:44.000 --> 45:45.000]  Okay.
[45:45.000 --> 45:48.000]  I'm going to skip this network break with only one today because another network needs
[45:48.000 --> 45:49.000]  to run its ads.
[45:49.000 --> 45:50.000]  I understand that.
[45:50.000 --> 45:51.000]  Good old folks at GCN.
[45:51.000 --> 45:52.000]  I love them.
[45:52.000 --> 45:57.000]  And then we are going to come back and have some special guests today as well.
[45:57.000 --> 46:02.000]  And then, you know, I think I may air some of the Megan Kelly interview.
[46:02.000 --> 46:04.000]  I've been thinking about it.
[46:04.000 --> 46:06.000]  I just go with my instinct.
[46:06.000 --> 46:10.000]  I'm thinking about airing some of it because I know the parts they're going to really manipulate.
[46:10.000 --> 46:14.000]  Because again, she'd asked me about Sandy Hook five times, Pizza Gate five times, Shibani
[46:14.000 --> 46:15.000]  five, six times.
[46:15.000 --> 46:19.000]  Again, I mean, I don't even want to say what she was saying to me because they'll take
[46:19.000 --> 46:21.000]  that out of context and say I said it.
[46:21.000 --> 46:22.000]  They're so deceptive.
[46:22.000 --> 46:24.000]  They hate this country so much in my view.
[46:24.000 --> 46:28.000]  I don't know if she does personally, but she works for people that do that are just squatting
[46:28.000 --> 46:32.000]  on us, praying on us, raping our consciousness, raping our psyche.
[46:32.000 --> 46:38.000]  I mean, it's just, I have a stack of news top Democrats saying start murdering everyone.
[46:38.000 --> 46:40.000]  I mean, they're so crazy.
[46:40.000 --> 46:46.000]  They're so power crazed that they think they're about to win a physical civil war with us.
[46:46.000 --> 46:48.000]  I mean, if they are just monsters.
[46:48.000 --> 46:54.000]  And I'm so sick of the bully.
[46:54.000 --> 46:56.000]  I just think about all the children they abort.
[46:56.000 --> 46:58.000]  I think about all the third world people.
[46:58.000 --> 47:00.000]  They starve to death while claiming they love them.
[47:00.000 --> 47:03.000]  I think about their carbon tax that would kill a billion people according to Lord Moncton's
[47:03.000 --> 47:04.000]  analysis over a decade.
[47:04.000 --> 47:08.000]  I just think about what dirtbags they are and the things they do in the class warfare,
[47:08.000 --> 47:13.000]  like this particular Democrat saying go out and kill Republicans on info wars.com.
[47:13.000 --> 47:16.000]  He says, because they're a bunch of greedy rich people.
[47:16.000 --> 47:23.000]  Did you know that the last time I checked the wealth of Democrats in Congress over Republicans
[47:23.000 --> 47:28.000]  is something like 10 to one, the most rich people in the world.
[47:28.000 --> 47:33.000]  There's only a few billionaires like Donald Trump and Peter teal that are libertarians
[47:33.000 --> 47:34.000]  are independent.
[47:34.000 --> 47:38.000]  They're almost all either fence sitters that fund both sides.
[47:38.000 --> 47:39.000]  The Koch brothers do that.
[47:39.000 --> 47:41.000]  Well, and of course, another brother's a big liberal.
[47:41.000 --> 47:45.000]  So if you balance that out, they've given more money to last 30 years of Democrats than
[47:45.000 --> 47:46.000]  Republicans.
[47:46.000 --> 47:49.000]  I mean, they back the Clintons.
[47:49.000 --> 47:53.000]  The point is, there's you can count Republican billionaires on two hands.
[47:53.000 --> 47:57.000]  There's hundreds and hundreds of Democrat ones.
[47:57.000 --> 48:01.000]  And they're all tax exempt offshore because they're using class warfare to divert how
[48:01.000 --> 48:03.000]  they're creating monopolistic systems.
[48:03.000 --> 48:08.000]  So, so, so here's part of the behind the scenes Megan Kelly and then the full video
[48:08.000 --> 48:10.000]  and audios on info wars.com.
[48:10.000 --> 48:17.000]  So number two on Google, number two on Twitter, number two on Facebook, about an hour ago
[48:17.000 --> 48:18.000]  when I checked, what's number one?
[48:18.000 --> 48:20.000]  What's the number one thing on the web today?
[48:20.000 --> 48:22.000]  But I mean, just our videos.
[48:22.000 --> 48:26.000]  Now, number two, overall, the Alex Jones, Megan Kelly story for a week now is the biggest
[48:26.000 --> 48:30.000]  story bigger than the criminal investigation of Trump, bigger than whatever.
[48:30.000 --> 48:31.000]  Why?
[48:31.000 --> 48:36.000]  Because they made it big trying to destroy you, trying to shut down your free speech,
[48:36.000 --> 48:45.000]  trying to try to dominate control, trying to set the precedent and prepare info wars
[48:45.000 --> 48:50.000]  to be sued for its free speech into oblivion.
[48:50.000 --> 48:53.000]  That's all the preparation that's going to set up that new standard.
[48:53.000 --> 48:58.000]  Because we have that from inside the law firms where the Democrats are planning this because
[48:58.000 --> 49:02.000]  some people in the law firms are not pure evil and they love America and they realize,
[49:02.000 --> 49:03.000]  wow, this is really dastardly.
[49:03.000 --> 49:07.000]  So see, we know pretty much everything that's going on.
[49:07.000 --> 49:11.000]  But without even talking to the moles, I already know what you're up to.
[49:11.000 --> 49:12.000]  Okay?
[49:12.000 --> 49:14.000]  And God's going to protect me or allow me to be destroyed.
[49:14.000 --> 49:15.000]  That doesn't matter.
[49:15.000 --> 49:17.000]  You're going to go down in the process.
[49:17.000 --> 49:19.000]  It's called a Pyrrhic victory.
[49:19.000 --> 49:22.000]  I'm not a sociopath, psychopath like you globalist.
[49:22.000 --> 49:23.000]  I want victory for my family.
[49:23.000 --> 49:25.000]  I want a future for your family together.
[49:25.000 --> 49:29.000]  I'm here to lay it on the line because it's an honor.
[49:29.000 --> 49:30.000]  It's what a man's supposed to do.
[49:30.000 --> 49:31.000]  I'm not a hero.
[49:31.000 --> 49:33.000]  This is what I'm supposed to do.
[49:33.000 --> 49:36.000]  This is my destiny.
[49:36.000 --> 49:38.000]  It's your destiny if you choose as well.
[49:38.000 --> 49:40.000]  This is what I was born for.
[49:40.000 --> 49:41.000]  This is the process.
[49:41.000 --> 49:44.000]  This is good versus evil.
[49:44.000 --> 49:45.000]  I want to be tested.
[49:45.000 --> 49:46.000]  I want to go through the fire.
[49:46.000 --> 49:47.000]  I don't like pain.
[49:47.000 --> 49:48.000]  I don't like attacks.
[49:48.000 --> 49:52.000]  It's not fun to have people look at me and spit at me and hate me on the street.
[49:52.000 --> 49:54.000]  But they're the minority of idiots.
[49:54.000 --> 50:00.000]  The people with glowing eyes that are alive and awake are so humbling of every color
[50:00.000 --> 50:02.000]  and every shape and every size.
[50:02.000 --> 50:07.000]  But with the soul, with God's light shining through them, that's what matters.
[50:07.000 --> 50:09.000]  I'm so humbled by our viewers and listeners.
[50:09.000 --> 50:12.000]  When I run into you, it's just you're so good.
[50:12.000 --> 50:17.000]  And I am so honored to even be associated with you to don't thank me.
[50:17.000 --> 50:19.000]  I love you.
[50:19.000 --> 50:22.000]  And I'm going to stumble and I'm weak.
[50:22.000 --> 50:24.000]  But my heart's right and I love you.
[50:24.000 --> 50:28.000]  God loves you and we love each other and we're going to win.
[50:28.000 --> 50:32.000]  We may not individually win, but together, the species and God's plan will win.
[50:32.000 --> 50:36.000]  Now, here's some excerpts of the first third of it all year more than the next hour as well.
[50:36.000 --> 50:38.000]  But the full thing's on infowars.com.
[50:38.000 --> 50:39.000]  Here it is.
[50:39.000 --> 50:40.000]  Rob did a great job.
[50:40.000 --> 50:42.000]  This is a phone call about a week and a half for Megyn Kelly.
[50:42.000 --> 50:44.000]  I got here where she's lying through her teeth.
[50:44.000 --> 50:49.000]  All I can do is give you my word and tell you, if there's one thing about me, I do what I say I'm going to do.
[50:49.000 --> 50:51.000]  And I don't double cross.
[50:51.000 --> 50:54.000]  You know, you just became very fascinating to me.
[50:54.000 --> 50:58.000]  I thought you were maybe, you know, one-dimensional guy.
[50:58.000 --> 50:59.000]  Like, this is your thing.
[50:59.000 --> 51:06.000]  My goal is for your listeners and the left, you know, who will be watching some on NBC to say,
[51:06.000 --> 51:08.000]  wow, that was really interesting.
[51:08.000 --> 51:12.000]  And then the next time I want to get somebody, they're going to say, look what you did to Alex Jones.
[51:12.000 --> 51:14.000]  It's not going to be some gotcha hit piece.
[51:14.000 --> 51:16.000]  I promise you that.
[51:16.000 --> 51:23.000]  We talked controversies and conspiracies.
[51:23.000 --> 51:24.000]  9-Eleven.
[51:24.000 --> 51:26.000]  Now, 9-Eleven was an inside job.
[51:26.000 --> 51:30.000]  But when I say inside job, it means criminal elements in our government, working with Saudi Arabia and others,
[51:30.000 --> 51:32.000]  wanted to frame Iraq for it.
[51:32.000 --> 51:33.000]  Just a fact.
[51:33.000 --> 51:43.000]  You were about to view and listen to information that's never before been seen or heard.
[51:43.000 --> 51:51.000]  In the past, MSM, corporate media, could tell the truth.
[51:51.000 --> 51:52.000]  They could lie.
[51:52.000 --> 51:53.000]  They could spend.
[51:53.000 --> 51:54.000]  It was up to them.
[51:54.000 --> 51:56.000]  They were the gods of information.
[51:56.000 --> 52:04.000]  But Megan Kelly waltzed in here in Austin, Texas, and told me that she wasn't going to talk about Sandy Hook.
[52:04.000 --> 52:06.000]  She wasn't going to talk about pizza gay.
[52:06.000 --> 52:07.000]  She wasn't going to talk about Shimani.
[52:07.000 --> 52:10.000]  She wasn't going to talk about Islamic terror attacks.
[52:10.000 --> 52:15.000]  That she wanted to do a softball profile of Alex Jones.
[52:15.000 --> 52:25.000]  And when she got here with her crew of intelligence operatives, she did the opposite of what she said.
[52:25.000 --> 52:28.000]  And so I was recording the whole time.
[52:28.000 --> 52:39.000]  From our pre-interviews, right through the interviews, we have a record of it so that you could decide for yourself what I really said and what I stood for.
[52:39.000 --> 52:45.000]  These tolerance haven't figured it out yet that information warfare is a two-way street.
[52:45.000 --> 52:49.000]  And we're going to give as good as we get.
[52:49.000 --> 52:50.000]  And that's what you're about to see.
[52:50.000 --> 52:54.000]  You alone will be the judge.
[52:54.000 --> 53:02.000]  You alone will be the jury of who's fake news, and who stands for America, and who stands against it.
[53:02.000 --> 53:05.000]  I'm Alex Jones, and this is the In Full War.
[53:05.000 --> 53:12.000]  Well, so I started my new job, you may have heard it, and we're going to start first with
[53:12.000 --> 53:17.000]  this Sunday night, this is a news magazine program across from 60 minutes.
[53:17.000 --> 53:22.000]  And it's a good, it's sort of a good opportunity just for long form storytelling.
[53:22.000 --> 53:27.000]  You know, it's like, it's not like the three minute interview, it's like the in-depth profiles of people.
[53:27.000 --> 53:31.000]  And at the top of my list was you.
[53:31.000 --> 53:35.000]  So it's like an investigative report in the fake news.
[53:35.000 --> 53:38.000]  No, no, what we're doing?
[53:38.000 --> 53:40.000]  Yeah, come on.
[53:40.000 --> 53:42.000]  No, no, no, hell no.
[53:42.000 --> 53:46.000]  The reason you, I mean, I know you guys know what to do.
[53:46.000 --> 53:52.000]  But the reason you are interesting to me is because I followed your custody case.
[53:52.000 --> 53:57.000]  And I think you had a very good point about the way the media was covering it.
[53:57.000 --> 54:04.000]  And for some reason treated you and your family and what was going on as fair game when they never would have done that.
[54:04.000 --> 54:07.000]  You know, if you will, a mainstream media figure.
[54:07.000 --> 54:11.000]  And I saw a different side of you in that whole thing.
[54:11.000 --> 54:17.000]  And I just, you're, you know, you just became very fascinating to me.
[54:17.000 --> 54:22.000]  I just sort of thought you were the maybe, you know, one dimensional guy, like this is the thing.
[54:22.000 --> 54:30.000]  And the comments I heard from you during the course of that trial and your plea to the media to be respectful of you and your kids.
[54:30.000 --> 54:34.000]  Just reminded me that you're, you're just like anybody.
[54:34.000 --> 54:37.000]  You're, you know, you're a dad and you go through the same things we go through.
[54:37.000 --> 54:39.000]  And I thought, you know, hit pause.
[54:39.000 --> 54:40.000]  Now that would be in it.
[54:40.000 --> 54:42.000]  Real quick, yeah, back in about 10 seconds.
[54:42.000 --> 54:46.000]  And when it all dawned on me, they told me it was going to air in July and you're going to hear that.
[54:46.000 --> 54:49.000]  And then when I learned they were going to air it on Father's Day.
[54:49.000 --> 54:59.000]  And I saw the PR show up in, let's not exaggerate, 15 newspapers or so that I just saw on the Google feed, the same five minutes.
[54:59.000 --> 55:04.000]  So they put the talking points out, they had the people kind of write it, put their name on it, act like it was independent.
[55:04.000 --> 55:11.000]  And then boom, Monday morning, Jones on Father's Day to rub it into the new town families.
[55:11.000 --> 55:13.000]  Did I initiate the interview?
[55:13.000 --> 55:15.000]  Did I say it was going to air on Father's Day?
[55:15.000 --> 55:16.000]  Did I dictate that?
[55:16.000 --> 55:21.000]  No, I mean, they're staging it all in front of everyone.
[55:21.000 --> 55:23.000]  It's incredible.
[55:23.000 --> 55:25.000]  And I've talked to top writers.
[55:25.000 --> 55:36.000]  They say, we've never seen this before except before the launch of wars where they're bringing in outside people at the top that are directing everybody not to quote anything you've actually said.
[55:36.000 --> 55:40.000]  That's why I had to release the tape because there's no way they can ignore that.
[55:40.000 --> 55:42.000]  So we're breaking through their controls.
[55:42.000 --> 55:46.000]  You see, we're breaking through, that's what they can't stand.
[55:46.000 --> 55:47.000]  They want a monopoly.
[55:47.000 --> 56:00.000]  They want to test the media, test the MSM that's become a utility of criminal elements of the federal government and that march in lockstep with spree decor.
[56:00.000 --> 56:05.000]  I mean, it's like those Prussian horses that, you know, march with their feet flying way up in the air.
[56:05.000 --> 56:09.000]  I mean, it is like watching well-trained horses or something.
[56:09.000 --> 56:10.000]  This is crazy.
[56:10.000 --> 56:17.000]  The precision of the lies, the sophistication of these lies gives me headaches to even understand it.
[56:17.000 --> 56:20.000]  No wonder the public doesn't know what to do.
[56:20.000 --> 56:21.000]  I mean, it's so crazy.
[56:21.000 --> 56:27.000]  I have to sit here and really analyze it until I get headaches to see the equations and how they're operating.
[56:27.000 --> 56:29.000]  And then I know what they're going to do next too.
[56:29.000 --> 56:35.000]  If I just get in a quiet room and really focus and then I can figure out how to counter them.
[56:35.000 --> 56:39.000]  To get inside the heads of these executives, they're just America haters, man.
[56:39.000 --> 56:42.000]  They're so twisted, beta-alpha.
[56:42.000 --> 56:43.000]  It's like a beta-alpha thing.
[56:43.000 --> 56:51.000]  I want a coin where it's like we've created this open free society and then alphas should born that and are loving and good as we're in a non wartime situation.
[56:51.000 --> 57:02.000]  And then the betas come in and create new forms of warfare to dominate us, but not for resources or power or a future, but to just they don't want alphas.
[57:02.000 --> 57:05.000]  They want the killers.
[57:05.000 --> 57:06.000]  They don't want lovers.
[57:06.000 --> 57:07.000]  They don't want fighters.
[57:07.000 --> 57:08.000]  They don't want.
[57:08.000 --> 57:12.000]  They want little creepy scumbags like Mr. Burns.
[57:12.000 --> 57:16.000]  We're going to go to Brighton Place and more of it, the full things on infowars.com.
[57:16.000 --> 57:23.000]  It's just listening to this and realizing the whole deception, the whole thing's been rigged, the whole thing's been choreographed.
[57:23.000 --> 57:32.000]  But it isn't going the way they thought because they still narcissistically and psychopathically and sociopathically follow these these set programs.
[57:32.000 --> 57:34.000]  They're very OCD these predators.
[57:34.000 --> 57:36.000]  And so they can't believe they're losing.
[57:36.000 --> 57:41.000]  They can't buy so they flail and they call for violence and they call for my death and Trump's death.
[57:41.000 --> 57:51.000]  And they organize all this crime and they get away with it because they are in control of the major central systems.
[57:51.000 --> 57:57.000]  But it's like watching Nero run around doing progressively more insane.
[57:57.000 --> 58:05.000]  And they look at me and think if they can just destroy me or Donald Trump, you know, we're the we're the twin evils that they come somehow could be back where they were.
[58:05.000 --> 58:10.000]  You're not where you were 10 years ago or a year ago, sweethearts.
[58:10.000 --> 58:14.000]  You're like a giant squid that attacks a sperm whale. The sperm whales always win.
[58:14.000 --> 58:17.000]  The squid still attack. They just think they're attacking.
[58:17.000 --> 58:18.000]  They're going in the water.
[58:18.000 --> 58:24.000]  The whale just dives, dives, dives, dives down to a level that the squid can't even go to and just passes out and just eats it.
[58:24.000 --> 58:26.000]  It goes back up.
[58:26.000 --> 58:27.000]  Yeah, you may tear my face up.
[58:27.000 --> 58:29.000]  You might even get one of my eyes, but you know what?
[58:29.000 --> 58:31.000]  I still smell the ladies.
[58:31.000 --> 58:32.000]  Don't need you.
[58:32.000 --> 58:36.000]  When I roll over dead in the sun, the shark's going to eat my blubber.
[58:36.000 --> 58:39.000]  But my babies are going to live on in that ocean.
[58:39.000 --> 58:44.000]  You are listening to GCN.
[58:44.000 --> 58:51.000]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:51.000 --> 58:56.000]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[58:56.000 --> 59:03.000]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[59:03.000 --> 59:12.000]  60 years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[59:12.000 --> 59:17.000]  But in the 21st century, there were silent weapons for quiet war.
[59:17.000 --> 59:26.000]  Ethenogens added to the food and water, and to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality, turn off our hormones, and accelerate our journey towards death.
[59:26.000 --> 59:30.000]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[59:30.000 --> 59:41.000]  Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[59:41.000 --> 59:47.000]  Discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today. It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands.
[59:47.000 --> 59:53.000]  And it starts at infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[59:53.000 --> 1:00:02.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:00:02.000 --> 1:00:12.000]  I was listening to this song this morning, Manorosh is an amazing band. Get on with the fascination.
[1:00:12.000 --> 1:00:17.000]  Before America can be great again, she must be free.
[1:00:17.000 --> 1:00:29.000]  It's not about the control. It's about the majesty, the mystery. Let's play a little bit of this song.
[1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:34.000]  Some idiots will say it's Illuminati. It's talking about illumination.
[1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:40.000]  The enemy claims they're giving illumination. That's the counterfeit.
[1:00:40.000 --> 1:00:48.000]  The real illumination is here. God's energy shining through the universe. The water of life.
[1:00:48.000 --> 1:01:00.000]  Space time continuum. Creation. Undeniable force that will guide us to the future.
[1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:10.000]  And the fall of these evil wicked people that are so delusional, they believed they would be successful in robbing us of our future.
[1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:19.000]  Alright, let's go ahead and play more of the Megyn Kelly interview.
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:31.000]  The comments I heard from you during the course of that trial and your plea to the media to be respectful of you and your kids just reminded me that you're just like anybody.
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:38.000]  You're a dad and you both are the same things we go through and I thought that would be an interesting story to tell.
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:49.000]  I don't know why I accepted this challenge. It's like some subconscious algorithm that leads me with the assurance of a sleepwalker.
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:02:02.000]  But I knew that if I entered the labyrinth of the Gorgon of this modern day Medusa, that through the process others would understand the larger deception.
[1:02:02.000 --> 1:02:10.000]  If I didn't take the challenge, then good, or at least an open heart, would be hiding from evil.
[1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:22.000]  And so that's why I let Megyn Kelly set up this conflict on her own terms on her own battlefield.
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:29.000]  Because despite the fact that she was delusional and believed that she would deceive me and my viewers, the end of the day she failed.
[1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:35.000]  Sure, but wouldn't the argument be then in the show, because I've seen that as a standard Democrat talking point of months and that's what you're doing.
[1:02:35.000 --> 1:02:42.000]  Well, he asked for privacy in his family, but he didn't do that for Sandy Hook and he didn't do that for the pizzeria.
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:47.000]  No, I mean, I can ask you about that.
[1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:54.000]  This is not going to be a contentious, you know, sort of gotcha exchange.
[1:02:54.000 --> 1:02:58.000]  That's not what this show is and that's really not what I want to do.
[1:02:58.000 --> 1:03:03.000]  I want to do index profiles on people, just interesting people.
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:09.000]  So I can ask you that, this is what the critics say, but this isn't going to be a ha, let's play a clip.
[1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:11.000]  Wow, here's the headlines.
[1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:18.000]  Megyn Kelly defends Alex Jones' interview, responds to backlash Sandy Hook claim is revolting.
[1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:25.000]  But then she didn't show in her promo video that I said, I believe Sandy Hook happened.
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:35.000]  And I had wargamed the three views that criminal groups went in and killed the kids or it happened as they officially said, or they use actors.
[1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:48.000]  I mean, we saw in 1990, our Congress being lied to by the daughter of the head of a PR firm about Saddam Hussein soldiers killing hundreds of babies bashing their brains out.
[1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:51.000]  It's not that Saddam was a good guy.
[1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:53.000]  It's not that a lot of us are even against the war.
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:04:02.000]  We were lied to with propaganda that they admittedly came out and told us was a fraud later.
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:07.000]  They took the babies out of incubators.
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:11.000]  Took the incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:16.000]  So in the interview, I'm talking to Kelly and I go, they staged the dead babies in the incubators.
[1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:18.000]  So it's okay to ask questions about Newtown.
[1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:20.000]  I'm not attacking the families.
[1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:35.000]  I think it probably did happen. She turns that all around to Jones doubles down and says nobody died in Newtown and hates the families to go out for anybody that dares question the official story when that's the heart of any free society.
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:49.000]  I'm not sure. I don't mind. I don't mind questions. What I don't like is, did you know or did your producers do that to you where I said Hillary Clinton, you know, personally, and it was telling a cheque so I could get the satire out of you guys.
[1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:53.000]  Took it out of context, but did personally kill kids by the Iraq war, Syria war.
[1:04:53.000 --> 1:05:06.000]  We'll be right back with more folks. Stay with us. I'm Alex Jones.
[1:05:23.000 --> 1:05:27.000]  That's typically government funded scientists and politicians who are pushing the climate change agenda.
[1:05:27.000 --> 1:05:31.000]  Despite the fact that historically the biggest polluter in the world is the government.
[1:05:31.000 --> 1:05:41.000]  You see, the globalist harped dangers of manmade climate change, which they renamed from global warming once the data didn't fit their agenda to push for carbon taxes in carbon currencies that allow them to subjugate the U.S.
[1:05:41.000 --> 1:05:44.000]  by impoverishing Americans through a new technocratic form of colonialism.
[1:05:44.000 --> 1:05:57.000]  The globalists don't want independent nation states with strong economies. They want unelected, super regional governments like the EU, consisting of member states that are subordinate to the globalist controlled economy driven by multinational banks and other unelected global bodies.
[1:05:57.000 --> 1:06:16.000]  Find out more at infowarstore.com. This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[1:06:16.000 --> 1:06:31.000]  Research across the board is clear. In fact, it's certified. When bacteria infect your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks. That's why the last surgeon general's report on oral health warns that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[1:06:31.000 --> 1:06:45.000]  Super Blue fluoride-free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula. It's loaded with good halogen iodine, some of the bad halogen fluoride. Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[1:06:45.000 --> 1:07:00.000]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue, chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more.

[1:07:09.000 --> 1:07:18.000]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[1:07:18.000 --> 1:07:37.000]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:33.000]  Reaching through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:38.000]  Behind the scenes with Megan Kelly, the exclusive. You're part of it now.
[1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:46.000]  You know, like the back off of that. It was in the same 30 seconds where I said I'm not talking about the pizza place I'm talking about in the Middle East.
[1:08:46.000 --> 1:09:04.000]  And how this whole thing got started. Trace?
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:37.000]  Info Wars Alex Jones, a far right web host, posted a YouTube video seen almost 500,000 times.
[1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:48.000]  The rumors spread, inspiring some newfound internet sleuths to start digging around in John Podesta's hacked emails searching for proof and location of the so called sex ring.
[1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:55.000]  What they found were numerous references to pizza.
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:09:58.000]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to stuff.
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:09:59.000]  A message to Hillary.
[1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:02.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:12.000]  When I think about all the children Hillary Clinton has personally murdered and chopped up and raped.
[1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:15.000]  I have zero fear standing up against her.
[1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:22.000]  Yeah, you heard me right. Hillary Clinton has personally murdered children.
[1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:25.000]  I just can't hold back the truth anymore.
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:33.000]  Hillary Clinton is one of the most vicious serial killers of the planet's ever seen.
[1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:35.000]  There's a twist to that.
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:40.000]  Am I talking about the devil worship story with her chief staff or campaign chairman?
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:43.000]  Is it the menu of blood and semen and body parts?
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:46.000]  Is that the Aleister Crowley event? The private event?
[1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:48.000]  Oh no, I'm not talking about that.
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:11:10.000]  I mean 200,000 plus dead Christians with her operation with Syria and her operation in Libya and not letting the Christians get out and directing Al Qaeda and ISIS who target and murder children and put them through sex slavery and throw Catholic priest off cliffs and kill people en masse and murder gays and everything else you can imagine because they don't like peaceful people.
[1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:14.000]  And they caught everybody there for open society and they love everybody.
[1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  Anything they do is for degradation.
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:30.000]  But someone could have been killed inside of your restaurant for no good reason other than people like Alex Jones fanned a conspiracy theory that even the DC police say has no basis in fact.
[1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:35.000]  Yes, it's a pack of lies and it's dangerous.
[1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:38.000]  No, this is completely unfamiliar to me.
[1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:43.000]  Remember you had James Oliphonis on Fox News? You're talking about fake news?
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:50.000]  Yes, and then you played a clip of me saying Hillary personally killed children.
[1:11:50.000 --> 1:12:00.000]  I don't remember the clip. I remember him and the nature of that exchange, which I think is the only time I've ever seen him.
[1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:13.000]  I mean, all I'm saying is I can send you the right wing watch clip. We're first reported it and they said John's tongue and cheek said that Hillary killed all these kids but then said it in Syria and Libya.
[1:12:13.000 --> 1:12:19.000]  So I mean, I'm just telling you that's the kind of stuff that scares me because I can stand for what I've said.
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:21.000]  And I can even say, yeah, I probably should.
[1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:31.000]  I'll take a look at that. That's very unfamiliar to me. All I can tell you is that I had to go backwards to make sure that doesn't happen.
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:32.000]  Sandy Hook.
[1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:41.000]  Sandy Hook's complex because I've had debates where we've devils advocates said the whole story is true and then I've had debates where I've said that none of it's true.
[1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:47.000]  When you say parents faked their children's death, people get very angry.
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:52.000]  Well, that's all I know, but they don't get angry about the half million debt I racked from the sanctions or they don't get angry about all the illegal stories.
[1:12:52.000 --> 1:12:53.000]  That's a dodge.
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:57.000]  No, no, it's not a dodge. The media never covers all the evil wars it's promoted.
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:13:00.000]  That doesn't excuse what you did and said about Newtown.
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:09.000]  Here's the difference. I looked at all the angles of Newtown and I made my statements long before the media even picked up on it.
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:29.000]  And then once the interview began here at the office in the morning and then the afternoon and then night, as she attacked me, as she spent 30, 40 minutes on Pizza Gate and on Newtown and on saying that I was claiming that Brits deserve to be bombed and gays deserve to be bombed by Islamists.
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  And I said, no, why do they bring them in? And then the Muslims target them. I'm not blaming them. I'm saying why do they not have survival instincts?
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:44.000]  And throughout it, she just sat there and played along with her greater deception.
[1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:55.000]  It was so incredibly sad to see that this woman had wedded herself to whatever anti-human force is in control of our civilization.
[1:13:55.000 --> 1:14:06.000]  And then I realized that I was so honored to not be part of the living dead culture that Megan Kelly and the rest of these servants occupy.
[1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:12.000]  I'm sort of, you know, for lack of a better term, I'm trying to create a different kind of program.
[1:14:12.000 --> 1:14:17.000]  And it's fine. You know, I'll ask you about some of the controversies, of course, and you'll say whatever you want to say.
[1:14:17.000 --> 1:14:24.000]  But it's not going to be some gotcha hit piece. I promise you that. It doesn't serve me. It doesn't do me any good.
[1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:30.000]  If I do that to you, then you go out there and you say, she did a hit piece on me. This is what she said. And this is what she did.
[1:14:30.000 --> 1:14:32.000]  And then next time I want to get somebody.
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:37.000]  Yeah. And then she went on to promise it's not a hit piece and promise it's not an investigative journal piece.
[1:14:37.000 --> 1:14:41.000]  And I said, listen, if it is, that's fine. But I want to actually answer your questions.
[1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:48.000]  And then I saw the edit of what they put out in the promo and it's all cut up to deceive.
[1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:54.000]  And that's why NBC, I told them when I was there, they were asking, I said, oh, no, I'm not taping.
[1:14:54.000 --> 1:14:58.000]  No, just my crew right next to us sitting there in chairs were taping. Of course we were taping.
[1:14:58.000 --> 1:15:02.000]  And, you know, we've, if you want to get really technical, you know, we fight big brother with big brother.
[1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:07.000]  I guess we haven't even got into the HD cameras or the microphones that we've got in some of the areas of the office.
[1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:11.000]  We don't have it inside our individual offices, but we've got it at the front doors, other places.
[1:15:11.000 --> 1:15:15.000]  I want a full review of all the surveillance cameras and the audio at the front doors.
[1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:19.000]  I bet we can catch some real crap talking on those. And then let's catch them in the street.
[1:15:19.000 --> 1:15:22.000]  Let's boost audio all the way on that too. Let's go all the way with these people.
[1:15:22.000 --> 1:15:24.000]  I mean, they want to play games. They want to edit me and they want to do this.
[1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:27.000]  I let them go there first. I waited until they put out a deceptive promo.
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:30.000]  I waited until she said, oh, it's a big investigative report.
[1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:35.000]  By the way, I knew that she was interviewing new town people three weeks ago.
[1:15:35.000 --> 1:15:39.000]  Some of them couldn't keep their mouth shut and we're talking to folks about it and tweeting it.
[1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:43.000]  So, I mean, I walked right into her trap. People say, well, why do I walk into traps?
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:46.000]  Because she said it was a piece and she wasn't interviewing anybody else.
[1:15:46.000 --> 1:15:51.000]  She wasn't interviewing my ex-wife and blah, blah, blah. And then I just knew it was all a load of manure.
[1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:56.000]  People say, well, then why did you do that? Because I believe in God. There's not just evil in this world.
[1:15:56.000 --> 1:16:02.000]  And so I pray to God that justice come out of this and that the truth be seen.
[1:16:02.000 --> 1:16:07.000]  Well, do they put up light under my face? Do they demonize me? Do they edit me?
[1:16:07.000 --> 1:16:12.000]  Will they hurt me physically? Will they hurt me in the eyes of dumb people?
[1:16:12.000 --> 1:16:16.000]  But when some dumb person walks over and knocks my glass over, slaps me in the back of the head,
[1:16:16.000 --> 1:16:19.000]  or says, I hope you die, you know, I just feel sorry for him.
[1:16:19.000 --> 1:16:22.000]  And I just say, I'm so sorry that the media has manipulated you.
[1:16:22.000 --> 1:16:26.000]  You know, I didn't really say those things. You just want to feel outraged.
[1:16:26.000 --> 1:16:31.000]  You feel like you're part of something. But it's the globalists that are actually enslaving your future.
[1:16:31.000 --> 1:16:33.000]  Now, of course, he joins us for the balance of the hour.
[1:16:33.000 --> 1:16:40.000]  He has big intel from our White House sources on what's currently happening with the criminal investigation.
[1:16:40.000 --> 1:16:46.000]  Now, again, we always knew this was coming. They build it to make it sound reasonable by successive approximation.
[1:16:46.000 --> 1:16:52.000]  That's why CNN, you know, two days ago ran with the headline, Trump is under criminal investigation.
[1:16:52.000 --> 1:16:56.000]  And then that was too much. But oh, maybe. And then now today he is.
[1:16:56.000 --> 1:17:00.000]  Okay, everybody says, fire coming. He fires coming. Now he's a bad guy.
[1:17:00.000 --> 1:17:04.000]  Well, the Unitary Executive, the president, unless he's selling out the country can do whatever he wants.
[1:17:04.000 --> 1:17:12.000]  But they don't care, even under current congressional views of a weakened president and the FBI now being the real presidency.
[1:17:12.000 --> 1:17:17.000]  Because the FBI is above all three branches of government with the media. It is, it is the new government.
[1:17:17.000 --> 1:17:19.000]  That's why they're on such power trips. They act like comies.
[1:17:19.000 --> 1:17:25.000]  This royalty and, you know, Mueller is this royalty and he's hired this army of people to go after our American president.
[1:17:25.000 --> 1:17:29.000]  The Clintons could commit all the crimes to sell out to China, the globalists.
[1:17:29.000 --> 1:17:35.000]  They could do all of this and commit it publicly and Loretta Lynch could order investigations to stop.
[1:17:35.000 --> 1:17:39.000]  That's all okay. But because this guy's a real president, here comes Mueller.
[1:17:39.000 --> 1:17:47.000]  We're all supposed to shake in fear. The FBI is destroying itself in self-immolation right now, just like Megan Kelly and all of them.
[1:17:47.000 --> 1:17:54.000]  They don't get it. And I'm not saying the whole FBI is bad, but all of you that are FBI agencies, you need to know something.
[1:17:54.000 --> 1:17:59.000]  You think this is a power trip? This is despicable. This is disgusting.
[1:17:59.000 --> 1:18:06.000]  And remember when the stock market crashes, if they destroy Trump. And remember, remember when your family is on the street.
[1:18:06.000 --> 1:18:11.000]  Remember, you did this to America. You, along with the whole media and the rest of it.
[1:18:11.000 --> 1:18:16.000]  Dr. Corsi's got his sources. He knows what the White House strategy is to counter all this.
[1:18:16.000 --> 1:18:23.000]  I mean, it's an amazing time to see what a lion Trump is surrounded by these hyenas.
[1:18:23.000 --> 1:18:30.000]  Well, the first thing to realize is that I think Donald Trump understands that his presidency is on the line.
[1:18:30.000 --> 1:18:40.000]  The goal right now of the special prosecutor Mueller is to produce enough information to impeach Donald Trump. That's the game.
[1:18:40.000 --> 1:18:46.000]  Now, Trump, you've got to remember to give turncoat Republicans enough cover to do what they've always wanted.
[1:18:46.000 --> 1:18:52.000]  That's right. In order to get Pence in there, whom they're comfortable with, he's a GOP, more establishment figure.
[1:18:52.000 --> 1:18:56.000]  Trump's tooth threatening even to the Paul Ryan ally.
[1:18:56.000 --> 1:19:00.000]  By the way, Stone, everybody said this six months ago, but they clearly now are trying to annoy Pence.
[1:19:00.000 --> 1:19:03.000]  And watch, they're going to go after Pence once he's in.
[1:19:03.000 --> 1:19:08.000]  Oh, of course. I mean, this is, but they'll be at least Pence, they think is one of the club.
[1:19:08.000 --> 1:19:11.000]  He's a former congressman. They think he'll play along.
[1:19:11.000 --> 1:19:13.000]  I certainly better than Trump to the...
[1:19:13.000 --> 1:19:15.000]  He's a Midwestern Christian. They're going to destroy him, too.
[1:19:15.000 --> 1:19:26.000]  Okay. Now, I agree that what's a play here is the very important article has just been come up this morning on zero hedge, which it's all about this.
[1:19:26.000 --> 1:19:30.000]  Rod Rosenstein. Now, they may recuse himself.
[1:19:30.000 --> 1:19:41.000]  Yes. Because see, as soon as the Democrats lost the argument on Russia and that was destroyed with sessions, testimony, they went to obstruction.
[1:19:41.000 --> 1:19:48.000]  Now, obstruction means that they're trying to investigate the Comey firing and Rosenstein will have to recuse himself.
[1:19:48.000 --> 1:19:50.000]  Stay there. You'll get the forum and come back.
[1:19:50.000 --> 1:19:53.000]  But Trump's right. This is the most empty witch hunt.
[1:19:53.000 --> 1:20:12.000]  I mean, this is like the witch hunt to end all witch hunts to destroy America.
[1:20:23.000 --> 1:20:40.000]  Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon you'll need a plan and place to survive. Forget bunkers. You're not a live underground gopher.

[1:23:59.000 --> 1:24:14.000]  The enemy has now announced they plan to criminally bring down the president. Will America rally to his aid or will we again fall to the globalist?
[1:24:14.000 --> 1:24:40.000]  Talk about a witch hunt.
[1:24:40.000 --> 1:24:53.000]  I know she is a witch. She looks like one. Bring her forward. I'm not a witch. I'm not a witch. But you are dressed as one. They dress me up like this.
[1:24:53.000 --> 1:25:06.000]  And this isn't my nose. It's a false one. Will. What? We did do the nose. The nose. And the hat. But she is a witch.
[1:25:06.000 --> 1:25:18.000]  Did you dress her up, babies? No. No, no. Yes. Yes. I bet. I bet. She has got a wart.
[1:25:18.000 --> 1:25:26.000]  What makes you think she's a witch? Oh, she turned me into a newt. A newt.
[1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:40.960]  Alright, of course, this is a short segment, long segment coming up, you'll have the floor
[1:25:40.960 --> 1:25:44.720]  to really flesh this out, but what do you think from our studies, from our research
[1:25:44.720 --> 1:25:49.280]  and our sources, is Trump's strategy with this ridiculous witch hunt that they've now
[1:25:49.280 --> 1:25:53.520]  put in all these democratic operatives that admit, and they're all chortling, that they're
[1:25:53.520 --> 1:25:57.960]  going to make up a case on him of obstruction when under the unitary executive, he could
[1:25:57.960 --> 1:26:00.160]  do whatever he wanted, but he didn't even do that.
[1:26:00.160 --> 1:26:05.240]  Well, Trump's got a very complicated, but very, I think, highly probable of success
[1:26:05.240 --> 1:26:07.440]  strategy in place with his lawyers.
[1:26:07.440 --> 1:26:10.080]  Well, he better, he's fighting a load of manure.
[1:26:10.080 --> 1:26:14.320]  And he is going to, I've always said, he always looks like he's going to lose just
[1:26:14.320 --> 1:26:18.320]  before he wins, and there's a two-fold strategy going on here.
[1:26:18.320 --> 1:26:23.080]  One is with a legal team, and I want to explain it, because we're going to very quickly see
[1:26:23.080 --> 1:26:29.960]  a very conservative person start to exert influence within the Justice Department.
[1:26:29.960 --> 1:26:34.680]  And I think you're going to find Trump is going to go on the Change the Story initiative
[1:26:34.680 --> 1:26:40.160]  today with his speech in Miami as going to take much more charge over the national narrative.
[1:26:40.160 --> 1:26:44.560]  I think there's also going to be a lot more restraint put on the mainstream media and
[1:26:44.560 --> 1:26:49.320]  less free access to do an act up session every day on television within the White House
[1:26:49.320 --> 1:26:50.800]  and the press room.
[1:26:50.800 --> 1:26:53.920]  So Trump is really aware of the strategy, he's been listening.
[1:26:53.920 --> 1:26:57.920]  And when we detail, I want to give you a few of the details of exactly what they're going
[1:26:57.920 --> 1:27:04.200]  to do to fight back on this Mueller and his investigation, and I think Trump has a strategy
[1:27:04.200 --> 1:27:05.760]  in place which is likely to succeed.
[1:27:05.760 --> 1:27:09.800]  He's going to need support, and I want to explain to people why I think Trump is going
[1:27:09.800 --> 1:27:10.880]  to win.
[1:27:10.880 --> 1:27:13.360]  Should we start into it now?
[1:27:13.360 --> 1:27:14.360]  Yes.
[1:27:14.360 --> 1:27:18.480]  Okay, well, first of all, you've got Mueller who has conducted this investigation.
[1:27:18.480 --> 1:27:27.240]  The article on Zero Hedge about Rosenstein, see, the Democrats made a major mistake.
[1:27:27.240 --> 1:27:33.640]  When they got sessions in testimony, sessions was correct that he had an executive, he could
[1:27:33.640 --> 1:27:38.120]  exert a privilege not to testify about conversations with the president.
[1:27:38.120 --> 1:27:42.040]  And they claim that that was preposterous, like claiming that the moon exists, but it's
[1:27:42.040 --> 1:27:45.640]  well documented for hundreds of years, codified in the law in the 80s.
[1:27:45.640 --> 1:27:49.600]  It's classic that you don't sit there and talk about because the attorney general, his
[1:27:49.600 --> 1:27:52.480]  client is the president, that's an attorney-client privilege.
[1:27:52.480 --> 1:27:57.200]  And they found that 1982 memo that was written to President Reagan by his assistant attorney
[1:27:57.200 --> 1:28:04.040]  general Olsen, who laid out that the attorney general cannot answer questions about conversations
[1:28:04.040 --> 1:28:08.480]  with the president in order to give the president a chance to exert executive privilege, and
[1:28:08.480 --> 1:28:10.840]  that's exactly what sessions did.
[1:28:10.840 --> 1:28:16.120]  It's also deconstructed totally this whole Russian narrative, and even Chris Wallace
[1:28:16.120 --> 1:28:18.640]  indicated that the Russian story is dead.
[1:28:18.640 --> 1:28:23.880]  Now, once that happened, the Democrats morphed into making it obstruction.
[1:28:23.880 --> 1:28:27.080]  And by the way, I got to say, you and Stone, everybody said that six months ago, they said
[1:28:27.080 --> 1:28:31.360]  when they're done, and this horse falls over dead, they're going to beat that to death
[1:28:31.360 --> 1:28:33.360]  for a while, and then they're going to move on to obstruction.
[1:28:33.360 --> 1:28:39.520]  Yes, and that's the downward the obstruction phase, and the problem is that this Rod Rosenstein
[1:28:39.520 --> 1:28:45.720]  is going to have to recuse himself because he wrote the order or the analysis that got
[1:28:45.720 --> 1:28:46.960]  Comey fired.
[1:28:46.960 --> 1:28:55.280]  Okay, now, the next person in line, if Rosenstein is out, is a woman named Rachel Brand, who
[1:28:55.280 --> 1:29:00.800]  was just recently appointed to the Department of Justice by President Trump and is a member
[1:29:00.800 --> 1:29:02.200]  of the Federalist Society.
[1:29:02.200 --> 1:29:03.200]  Good.
[1:29:03.200 --> 1:29:07.800]  So, she is going to be solidly in charge, I think, within the next short-
[1:29:07.800 --> 1:29:11.320]  And Federalist means they know the President, in his purview, has power.
[1:29:11.320 --> 1:29:16.000]  And the Constitution, she is a student of the Constitution, she's a conservative, she's
[1:29:16.000 --> 1:29:19.160]  appointed by Trump, Trump, I think, finally.
[1:29:19.160 --> 1:29:22.320]  And let's be clear, I'm not a fan of the President having absolute power, but you can debate
[1:29:22.320 --> 1:29:23.840]  the separation of powers here.
[1:29:23.840 --> 1:29:28.720]  The FBI has no right, when it's under the executive, to just be running around claiming
[1:29:28.720 --> 1:29:31.080]  it's the fourth branch of government with supremacy.
[1:29:31.080 --> 1:29:35.720]  Well, that's exactly right, and I think this is going to be a major move for Trump to get
[1:29:35.720 --> 1:29:36.960]  back into the department.
[1:29:36.960 --> 1:29:40.880]  Stay there, let's break it all down with the experts analysis of Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[1:29:40.880 --> 1:29:43.200]  The President is the President, not the FBI.
[1:29:43.200 --> 1:29:47.200]  James Comey and Mueller are not the President, even though they're arrogant, they're so arrogant
[1:29:47.200 --> 1:29:48.880]  they make me sick.
[1:29:48.880 --> 1:29:49.880]  What traitors this country?
[1:29:49.880 --> 1:29:53.760]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[1:29:53.760 --> 1:30:22.480]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:30:22.480 --> 1:30:26.760]  One thing is for sure, with how long it's taking NBC to edit making Kelly's interview
[1:30:26.760 --> 1:30:31.720]  with Alex Jones prior to just airing it, we can expect that they will be misrepresenting
[1:30:31.720 --> 1:30:34.400]  his statements with skilled editing techniques.
[1:30:34.400 --> 1:30:39.080]  Why not just release the entire interview unedited and prove you're not fake news, NBC?
[1:30:39.080 --> 1:30:43.880]  They'd like you to believe that Alex Jones, not Adam Lanza, is the real bad guy in the
[1:30:43.880 --> 1:30:48.600]  Sandy Hook Massacre because he said he believes there was a government conspiracy at work.
[1:30:48.600 --> 1:30:52.880]  However, all of this will backfire on the mainstream media as everyday Americans are
[1:30:52.880 --> 1:30:58.520]  increasingly becoming more aware of the staging, faking and lying that is the mainstream media.

[1:31:21.120 --> 1:31:25.200]  auto ship because we hold back a surplus for auto ship customers.

[1:31:30.440 --> 1:31:34.680]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the

[1:31:44.040 --> 1:31:49.320]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win and with the new auto ship feature at infowarslife.com,
[1:31:49.320 --> 1:31:50.720]  this is a sure win.
[1:31:50.720 --> 1:31:56.720]  10% off on auto ship, win, win, win at infowarslife.com, free shipping on orders above $50.
[1:31:56.720 --> 1:32:00.920]  And all out of stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for auto ship.
[1:32:00.920 --> 1:32:05.280]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[1:32:05.280 --> 1:32:10.000]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[1:32:10.000 --> 1:32:11.520]  to detoxify the body.
[1:32:11.520 --> 1:32:13.880]  That's why I'm introducing ZShield.
[1:32:13.880 --> 1:32:16.360]  Product metal and chemical defense support.
[1:32:16.360 --> 1:32:17.920]  It's made in the USA.
[1:32:17.920 --> 1:32:22.800]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[1:32:22.800 --> 1:32:24.640]  the body and it supports the info war.
[1:32:24.640 --> 1:32:26.920]  It is a classical 360 win.
[1:32:26.920 --> 1:32:31.400]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe
[1:32:31.400 --> 1:32:36.040]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[1:32:36.040 --> 1:32:37.040]  get.
[1:32:37.040 --> 1:32:40.280]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of this
[1:32:40.280 --> 1:32:45.320]  country in the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you
[1:32:45.320 --> 1:32:50.560]  can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the
[1:32:50.560 --> 1:32:53.240]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[1:32:53.240 --> 1:32:56.440]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[1:32:56.440 --> 1:33:14.120]  Now it's time to change our bodies with ZShield and InfoWarsLive.com.
[1:33:46.720 --> 1:33:52.440]  And let's keep the warm beer family and the Scalise family and all of the victims of the
[1:33:52.440 --> 1:33:58.720]  congressional shooting in our hearts and prayers.
[1:33:58.720 --> 1:34:04.000]  And it was quite a day and our police officers were incredible, weren't they?
[1:34:04.000 --> 1:34:11.200]  They did a great job.
[1:34:11.200 --> 1:34:20.480]  And let us all pray for a future peace, unity and safety for all of our people.
[1:34:20.480 --> 1:34:23.000]  And for Cuba.
[1:34:23.000 --> 1:34:35.360]  I am so thrilled to be back here with all of my friends in Little Havana.
[1:34:35.360 --> 1:34:38.360]  I love it.
[1:34:38.360 --> 1:34:40.840]  I love this city.
[1:34:40.840 --> 1:34:46.200]  And one of the big, thank you, thank you.
[1:34:46.200 --> 1:34:50.880]  Now, this is an amazing community.
[1:34:50.880 --> 1:34:54.040]  The Cuban American community is so much love.
[1:34:54.040 --> 1:34:56.800]  I saw that immediately.
[1:34:56.800 --> 1:34:57.800]  Thank you, darling.
[1:34:57.800 --> 1:35:02.920]  Oh, do I love you too.
[1:35:02.920 --> 1:35:08.280]  What you've built here, a vibrant culture, a thriving neighborhood, the spirit of adventure
[1:35:08.280 --> 1:35:11.640]  is a testament to what a free Cuba could be.
[1:35:11.640 --> 1:35:16.920]  And with God's help, a free Cuba is what we will soon achieve.
[1:35:16.920 --> 1:35:23.760]  He's going to reverse Obama, which would select corporations being able to go in and exploit
[1:35:23.760 --> 1:35:25.840]  the Cubans instead of them totally opening up.
[1:35:25.840 --> 1:35:30.920]  I'm for opening up Cuba if it's a total open up, not work with the dictator Raul, which
[1:35:30.920 --> 1:35:32.920]  select deals with Google and others.
[1:35:32.920 --> 1:35:34.760]  No, no more monopoly capitalism.
[1:35:34.760 --> 1:35:38.840]  Yeah, I think Trump is going to reverse the globalist strategy right now.
[1:35:38.840 --> 1:35:41.200]  It's going to send the Democrats insane.
[1:35:41.200 --> 1:35:44.320]  Which is put in communists that have them as clients for slave labor.
[1:35:44.320 --> 1:35:45.920]  No, really reform.
[1:35:45.920 --> 1:35:47.280]  Open up to everybody.
[1:35:47.280 --> 1:35:49.400]  Don't be like China and have crony capitalism.
[1:35:49.400 --> 1:35:50.400]  Exactly.
[1:35:50.400 --> 1:35:51.400]  And all the- Keep it going.
[1:35:51.400 --> 1:35:54.120]  All the globalists who thought that they were going to win are going to lose today and
[1:35:54.120 --> 1:35:55.800]  they're going to go insane.
[1:35:55.800 --> 1:35:58.520]  This is Trump is- But look, Trump doesn't look unhappy.
[1:35:58.520 --> 1:35:59.520]  He doesn't look worried.
[1:35:59.520 --> 1:36:00.600]  He looks very confident.
[1:36:00.600 --> 1:36:01.600]  Look at him.
[1:36:01.600 --> 1:36:06.200]  But he doesn't want to have to move against the Democrats with military force, but they
[1:36:06.200 --> 1:36:08.680]  are an outside power.
[1:36:08.680 --> 1:36:11.360]  I think he's got a strategy in place.
[1:36:11.360 --> 1:36:12.840]  We got what he has to say.
[1:36:12.840 --> 1:36:13.840]  Trump is packed.
[1:36:13.840 --> 1:36:14.840]  You know, it wasn't designed for this.
[1:36:14.840 --> 1:36:15.840]  There's the word.
[1:36:15.840 --> 1:36:16.840]  I'd like to clarify it.
[1:36:16.840 --> 1:36:17.840]  He's supposed to go reverse today.
[1:36:17.840 --> 1:36:19.840]  I think he'll do it on the speech.
[1:36:19.840 --> 1:36:28.160]  We are delighted to be joined by so many friends and leaders of our great community.
[1:36:28.160 --> 1:36:34.360]  I want to express our deep gratitude to a man that's really become a friend of mine.
[1:36:34.360 --> 1:36:37.600]  And I want to tell you, he is one tough competitor.
[1:36:37.600 --> 1:36:39.080]  Senator Marco Rubio.
[1:36:39.080 --> 1:36:44.440]  I remember Rubio- I know, Stone first told me, like, like, what Trump had elected that
[1:36:44.440 --> 1:36:46.120]  Rubio was actually in the fold.
[1:36:46.120 --> 1:36:47.120]  Rubio.
[1:36:47.120 --> 1:36:48.120]  He is tough.
[1:36:48.120 --> 1:36:49.120]  Man.
[1:36:49.120 --> 1:36:50.120]  That's it.
[1:36:50.120 --> 1:36:51.120]  That's right there.
[1:36:51.120 --> 1:36:57.240]  He's reversing everything that Obama did because Rubio has stood for freedom in Cuba
[1:36:57.240 --> 1:37:02.320]  and opposition to the Castro brothers, who are just killed at least a half million people.
[1:37:02.320 --> 1:37:03.320]  Right.
[1:37:03.320 --> 1:37:07.240]  Another friend of mine, Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart.
[1:37:07.240 --> 1:37:11.160]  And I'll tell you, I loved what he said and I appreciate it.
[1:37:11.160 --> 1:37:13.800]  Mario, I appreciated what you said.
[1:37:13.800 --> 1:37:14.800]  So much.
[1:37:14.800 --> 1:37:17.880]  Notice under Obama, he banned Cubans coming in because they're libertarians.
[1:37:17.880 --> 1:37:20.960]  See, again, they want people that don't know what Communism is like.
[1:37:20.960 --> 1:37:21.960]  Yeah.
[1:37:21.960 --> 1:37:23.960]  Like, bring all the brown people you want from Cuba that don't like Communism.
[1:37:23.960 --> 1:37:25.440]  I'm not hiding from brown people.
[1:37:25.440 --> 1:37:26.960]  I'm hiding from socialists.
[1:37:26.960 --> 1:37:33.440]  Well, and this was what, it was a globalist plan to open Cuba to corporations.
[1:37:33.440 --> 1:37:34.720]  Select globalist corporations.
[1:37:34.720 --> 1:37:35.720]  Select.
[1:37:35.720 --> 1:37:39.000]  And on the Obama agenda and on the Goldman Sachs plan.
[1:37:39.000 --> 1:37:42.040]  Well, guys, as soon as he gives us the new policy, we'll go back to the president.
[1:37:42.040 --> 1:37:46.260]  I want to get into his strategy, though, with this, again, they build it up, make it look
[1:37:46.260 --> 1:37:47.260]  like an investigation.
[1:37:47.260 --> 1:37:51.400]  We told you six months ago, there will be calls for indictments, there will be calls
[1:37:51.400 --> 1:37:52.400]  for impeachment.
[1:37:52.400 --> 1:37:54.120]  There will be all of this crap.
[1:37:54.120 --> 1:38:00.840]  And I told you up front, from our intel, Flynn's a great patriot, so above board that he didn't
[1:38:00.840 --> 1:38:04.880]  try to hide anything that he had consulting deals with like seven different countries,
[1:38:04.880 --> 1:38:10.440]  Turkey, you name it, RT paid him $34,000 to come to a gala and speak, and of course he
[1:38:10.440 --> 1:38:11.440]  came and spoke.
[1:38:11.440 --> 1:38:14.320]  And of course they tried to glad hand even stuff and he had dinner and was, you know,
[1:38:14.320 --> 1:38:16.720]  you know, 20 feet from Putin or whatever and they shook hands.
[1:38:16.720 --> 1:38:18.760]  It's all in video.
[1:38:18.760 --> 1:38:24.320]  He got Russia through back channels when he was the head of defense intelligence to start
[1:38:24.320 --> 1:38:25.480]  bombing ISIS.
[1:38:25.480 --> 1:38:27.360]  Our military said no to Obama.
[1:38:27.360 --> 1:38:31.480]  He was authorized at the highest levels to do that in a checkmate against Obama when
[1:38:31.480 --> 1:38:34.720]  the real deep state, because there's the patriot deep state and there's the globalist
[1:38:34.720 --> 1:38:35.720]  deep state.
[1:38:35.720 --> 1:38:39.280]  When our real deep state said we're not part of this, that's what they're not telling you.
[1:38:39.280 --> 1:38:41.640]  The civil war isn't just deep state.
[1:38:41.640 --> 1:38:45.320]  It's deep state patriots against deep state bad guys.
[1:38:45.320 --> 1:38:50.040]  And what Trump is doing here, you see now the Democrats have morphed.
[1:38:50.040 --> 1:38:57.320]  They lost the Russia collusion mem when sessions testified and sessions, even Chris Matthews
[1:38:57.320 --> 1:38:59.800]  said the Russia story's dead.
[1:38:59.800 --> 1:39:01.280]  Now they're into obstruction.
[1:39:01.280 --> 1:39:07.680]  Well, first thing about obstruction is that this Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein
[1:39:07.680 --> 1:39:13.800]  is going to have to recuse himself because the obstruction is why was Comey fired and
[1:39:13.800 --> 1:39:16.880]  it was Rosenstein who wrote the memo that got Comey fired.
[1:39:16.880 --> 1:39:17.880]  And they act like that's dirty.
[1:39:17.880 --> 1:39:24.320]  No, if a judge, you know, has say a husband or wife or son or whatever that's in a court
[1:39:24.320 --> 1:39:26.960]  case in front of her, they have to recuse.
[1:39:26.960 --> 1:39:30.520]  But they know the public's ignorant about legal matters, so they act like it's an admission
[1:39:30.520 --> 1:39:31.520]  of guilt.
[1:39:31.520 --> 1:39:32.520]  Right.
[1:39:32.520 --> 1:39:38.600]  Well, see, the key is that racial brand takes over as soon as Rosenstein recuses himself.
[1:39:38.600 --> 1:39:39.840]  And she's a federalist.
[1:39:39.840 --> 1:39:43.160]  She is a constitutionally trained lawyer.
[1:39:43.160 --> 1:39:44.360]  She's one of us.
[1:39:44.360 --> 1:39:49.240]  She believes in the, you know, she's a member of the Federalist Society and she's going
[1:39:49.240 --> 1:39:51.760]  to be a strong Trump ally.
[1:39:51.760 --> 1:39:54.480]  She's going to work for Trump and it's not just being Trump's ally.
[1:39:54.480 --> 1:39:56.760]  I'm on some worship fest of Trump.
[1:39:56.760 --> 1:39:58.280]  He is on the right side of history.
[1:39:58.280 --> 1:40:01.320]  He's under total attack by total enemies.
[1:40:01.320 --> 1:40:04.680]  How are people, because I see the articles every day, Trump losing his base, Wall Street
[1:40:04.680 --> 1:40:05.680]  Journal.
[1:40:05.680 --> 1:40:06.680]  It's all lies.
[1:40:06.680 --> 1:40:09.920]  His polls are up and they're much higher than they say, ladies and gentlemen, it's never
[1:40:09.920 --> 1:40:11.240]  been more clear cut.
[1:40:11.240 --> 1:40:18.040]  And so when she takes over, first of all, now Mueller can come under examination because
[1:40:18.040 --> 1:40:23.120]  Mueller has already been hints dropped that Mueller is way afield that he has not authority
[1:40:23.120 --> 1:40:25.720]  to go after this obstruction.
[1:40:25.720 --> 1:40:27.560]  And there's two parts of the obstruction.
[1:40:27.560 --> 1:40:32.000]  One, they can't prove that Donald Trump didn't have the authority, he had the authority to
[1:40:32.000 --> 1:40:36.800]  direct the Department of Justice to do what he wants it to do.
[1:40:36.800 --> 1:40:39.200]  And the remedy there is just impeach him.
[1:40:39.200 --> 1:40:44.160]  But it is not obstruction of justice if he orders, Dershowitz from Harvard Law made the
[1:40:44.160 --> 1:40:50.320]  case very clearly that Trump had the authority to end this whole Mueller investigation if
[1:40:50.320 --> 1:40:51.320]  he wants.
[1:40:51.320 --> 1:40:52.320]  He's got the authority.
[1:40:52.320 --> 1:40:55.720]  The only remedy is to impeach him and the Democrats don't have the vote.
[1:40:55.720 --> 1:41:00.880]  Now once Rachel Brand takes over, remember, this is Casiewicz, Casiewicz is the New York
[1:41:00.880 --> 1:41:06.120]  attorney who is now heading the legal team for Donald Trump and he's brilliant.
[1:41:06.120 --> 1:41:09.280]  And what they're going to do is they're going to say, we're going to turn the tables.
[1:41:09.280 --> 1:41:12.760]  Pretty soon, Mueller is going to be under investigation himself.
[1:41:12.760 --> 1:41:17.560]  And they're going to say the real obstruction of justice was what Comey admitted in his
[1:41:17.560 --> 1:41:22.480]  testimony under oath that Clinton and Loretta Lynch were conspiring on the tarman.
[1:41:22.480 --> 1:41:26.760]  And it gets worse under federal law if he believed there was something that could even
[1:41:26.760 --> 1:41:28.120]  potentially criminal.
[1:41:28.120 --> 1:41:29.520]  He should have given that to the Attorney General.
[1:41:29.520 --> 1:41:37.520]  But beyond that, any work product is under law to be filed and then transcribed into computer
[1:41:37.520 --> 1:41:41.480]  under federal law and foyer and so many other things.
[1:41:41.480 --> 1:41:43.400]  He committed so many crimes.
[1:41:43.400 --> 1:41:44.400]  Yes.
[1:41:44.400 --> 1:41:47.080]  And he also obstructed his own investigation.
[1:41:47.080 --> 1:41:49.440]  He blocked the investigation of the emails.
[1:41:49.440 --> 1:41:53.000]  Well, let's talk about the FBI, because I know some senior FBI agents and I know some
[1:41:53.000 --> 1:41:54.160]  big retired ones.
[1:41:54.160 --> 1:41:56.560]  And without of the blue, I'm going to say this to puff you up, it's true, they always
[1:41:56.560 --> 1:41:57.560]  bring up you.
[1:41:57.560 --> 1:42:01.120]  They love you as a bank investigator and I don't know what your history is with the FBI.
[1:42:01.120 --> 1:42:02.120]  You've got such a big history.
[1:42:02.120 --> 1:42:03.520]  I've got lots of work with you.
[1:42:03.520 --> 1:42:04.840]  But they really like you.
[1:42:04.840 --> 1:42:08.160]  The average FBI person is pretty hardworking, good Americana.
[1:42:08.160 --> 1:42:09.920]  Then how can there be such scum at the top?
[1:42:09.920 --> 1:42:12.800]  I guess they fear that, so they put bad guys at the top.
[1:42:12.800 --> 1:42:15.680]  I mean, what is the FBI itself going to do?
[1:42:15.680 --> 1:42:21.320]  Remember that, because we've got all these socialists leaking this info, Obama put people
[1:42:21.320 --> 1:42:26.960]  into all these agencies who were socialists, Obama politicized the Department of Justice.
[1:42:26.960 --> 1:42:30.600]  He politicized the IRS, he politicized the EPA.
[1:42:30.600 --> 1:42:33.280]  So should we see patriots leak criminal activity?
[1:42:33.280 --> 1:42:36.600]  No, what we should do is we should remove it from office and go out.
[1:42:36.600 --> 1:42:40.200]  I know, but if people have got the dirt on Mueller and Comey and all them, it's time to
[1:42:40.200 --> 1:42:41.200]  burn them.
[1:42:41.200 --> 1:42:44.400]  The people are either going to burn America and burn Trump or you're going to burn these
[1:42:44.400 --> 1:42:45.400]  people.
[1:42:45.400 --> 1:42:52.400]  Step one is we get Rachel Brand, who's effectively in charge of the Department of Justice.
[1:42:52.400 --> 1:43:00.200]  Step two is Mueller's going to be exposed and his ties with the entire Obama team and
[1:43:00.200 --> 1:43:05.880]  Comey are going to be exposed and Mueller's conversations with Comey are going to be investigated
[1:43:05.880 --> 1:43:07.680]  to find out if he's not already compromised.
[1:43:07.680 --> 1:43:08.920]  And by the way, let's expand.
[1:43:08.920 --> 1:43:14.040]  Clearly Comey was covering his butt, knowing that as president, the president has intel
[1:43:14.040 --> 1:43:15.040]  that he was the leaker.
[1:43:15.040 --> 1:43:18.840]  He did that outrage that the media tried to cover for.
[1:43:18.840 --> 1:43:21.240]  It's like saying, I've got 20 dead kids in my basement.
[1:43:21.240 --> 1:43:24.280]  Comey just said, I'm the leaker, which Trump had already predicted.
[1:43:24.280 --> 1:43:25.280]  That is incredible.
[1:43:25.280 --> 1:43:26.780]  And there's leaks.
[1:43:26.780 --> 1:43:30.640]  Comey probably is responsible for seven or eight major leaks that can be proved.
[1:43:30.640 --> 1:43:31.640]  And Mueller now is responsible.
[1:43:31.640 --> 1:43:34.280]  And we know he's under testimony saying he didn't leak previously.
[1:43:34.280 --> 1:43:36.200]  If we can catch him, that's more perjury.
[1:43:36.200 --> 1:43:41.240]  Okay, but see, as Trump plays this out and gets control of the Justice Department, they're
[1:43:41.240 --> 1:43:43.280]  going to turn the tables.
[1:43:43.280 --> 1:43:47.680]  The real obstruction of justice was Comey obstructing, you know, I know, but the deciding
[1:43:47.680 --> 1:43:50.440]  factor is going to be turncoat Republicans.
[1:43:50.440 --> 1:43:53.080]  Because if they join the Democrats, it won't matter.
[1:43:53.080 --> 1:43:54.080]  They'll impeach him.
[1:43:54.080 --> 1:43:58.840]  So we need to be not in a violent way like the left does, but bird-dogging these, these
[1:43:58.840 --> 1:44:03.880]  turncoats and letting them know that we know the game plan and that they are the deciding
[1:44:03.880 --> 1:44:04.880]  factor.
[1:44:04.880 --> 1:44:06.720]  It is the Paul Ryan's and others.
[1:44:06.720 --> 1:44:11.400]  They are where all the leverage legally and lawfully, and I mean, if you, if they're
[1:44:11.400 --> 1:44:15.440]  in your family, folks, the country's hanging by a thread, I don't care who you are out
[1:44:15.440 --> 1:44:16.440]  there.
[1:44:16.440 --> 1:44:19.440]  If these turncoat Republicans aren't put in line, we're going to have a giant civil
[1:44:19.440 --> 1:44:23.080]  war that the left is openly looking for.
[1:44:23.080 --> 1:44:28.840]  The goal here is within about 30 days to have under investigation Comey.
[1:44:28.840 --> 1:44:29.840]  Yeah, yeah, start over.
[1:44:29.840 --> 1:44:31.120]  Because I've been interrupting.
[1:44:31.120 --> 1:44:32.120]  Start over.
[1:44:32.120 --> 1:44:33.120]  I apologize.
[1:44:33.120 --> 1:44:34.120]  No, no problem.
[1:44:34.120 --> 1:44:40.360]  The point is, as soon as we get effective control with racial brand, once Rosenstein
[1:44:40.360 --> 1:44:46.240]  recuses recuses himself, you've got the opportunity then to go after Mueller and show how Mueller
[1:44:46.240 --> 1:44:51.400]  compromised himself with Comey, their conversations, their private conversations.
[1:44:51.400 --> 1:44:56.000]  We need to know what they were about and the leaks that were orchestrated both by Comey
[1:44:56.000 --> 1:45:01.520]  and by now Mueller, who's also leaking are allowing people within his staff to leak.
[1:45:01.520 --> 1:45:04.840]  These are potentially criminal activity.
[1:45:04.840 --> 1:45:12.280]  Now, once this is all exposed and Mueller is exposed as another Comey operative, another
[1:45:12.280 --> 1:45:18.960]  Obama-Clinton operative, then he'll be forced to resign and the real investigations under
[1:45:18.960 --> 1:45:22.920]  the Department of Justice can begin turning the tables on the Democrats because it was
[1:45:22.920 --> 1:45:23.920]  the Democrats.
[1:45:23.920 --> 1:45:28.040]  It was Hillary Clinton and Podesta who were being paid for Russia.
[1:45:28.040 --> 1:45:30.560]  It was Comey who was obstructing justice.
[1:45:30.560 --> 1:45:35.440]  Being Clinton and was doing in this campaign, they're now blaming.
[1:45:35.440 --> 1:45:36.840]  Not going after Hillary.
[1:45:36.840 --> 1:45:41.400]  Imagine, Trump's coming in, they obstructed justice on the email, on the servers, on
[1:45:41.400 --> 1:45:46.520]  the uranium, on the missiles, on China, on everything, working the Arab Spring, selling
[1:45:46.520 --> 1:45:47.520]  us out to Islam.
[1:45:47.520 --> 1:45:50.840]  They're the ones that the government, the good people in the government are all mad
[1:45:50.840 --> 1:45:52.480]  about, bipartisanly.
[1:45:52.480 --> 1:45:53.480]  How do they turn it around?
[1:45:53.480 --> 1:45:59.640]  They come in and flip the narrative on to Trump and then emblematic, look at RudgerPort.com.
[1:45:59.640 --> 1:46:02.640]  Is it Illinois be the first state to fall for bankruptcy?
[1:46:02.640 --> 1:46:07.480]  Just like we've seen happen with Puerto Rico, look everywhere the Democrats run things,
[1:46:07.480 --> 1:46:12.520]  they create crime, they create poverty because they want to be el-hefes.
[1:46:12.520 --> 1:46:16.200]  They want a bunch of poor people under their control.
[1:46:16.200 --> 1:46:21.240]  And the goal, I think of what Donald Trump's doing in the Justice Department, will to be
[1:46:21.240 --> 1:46:23.680]  soon to have the real investigation start.
[1:46:23.680 --> 1:46:28.080]  The real obstruction is on Comey and the Democrats.
[1:46:28.080 --> 1:46:33.880]  The real collusion with Russia is on Hillary, Podesta and the Democrats.
[1:46:33.880 --> 1:46:34.880]  They're the ones who sold-
[1:46:34.880 --> 1:46:38.360]  And that's why Trump's mad at the Attorney General, who I know is waiting for process
[1:46:38.360 --> 1:46:39.360]  to play out.
[1:46:39.360 --> 1:46:44.440]  Trump is on the hide, he's like, dude, they're Chinese and Russian agents, they're totally
[1:46:44.440 --> 1:46:49.280]  sold us out, they've been caught leaking committing crimes, indict them, and why has
[1:46:49.280 --> 1:46:50.280]  sessions?
[1:46:50.280 --> 1:46:54.840]  You know, I think one of the best people ever in the Senate, very good man, but he's almost
[1:46:54.840 --> 1:46:56.360]  so good at issues.
[1:46:56.360 --> 1:47:02.680]  He won't do something aggressive even if somebody deserves it, but sessions had the most brilliant
[1:47:02.680 --> 1:47:03.680]  move of all.
[1:47:03.680 --> 1:47:11.040]  He quietly ended, single-handedly, the Russian collusion meme by demonstrating it had no
[1:47:11.040 --> 1:47:12.040]  validity.
[1:47:12.040 --> 1:47:13.040]  He did kill it.
[1:47:13.040 --> 1:47:14.040]  He killed it.
[1:47:14.040 --> 1:47:18.800]  And now what's happening, you've got Rosenstein, who is from Maryland, who is also involved
[1:47:18.800 --> 1:47:24.680]  in McCullough and this McCabe, where they were giving money to McCabe, who is top in
[1:47:24.680 --> 1:47:30.280]  the FBI, they were giving money to his wife to run for office in Maryland, the Democrats.
[1:47:30.280 --> 1:47:31.680]  I mean, these people are sick.
[1:47:31.680 --> 1:47:36.480]  So you've got a whole nest here, a Maryland, and of course McCullough wants to run for
[1:47:36.480 --> 1:47:37.480]  president.
[1:47:37.480 --> 1:47:38.480]  Trump is gonna blow this apart.
[1:47:38.480 --> 1:47:39.480]  Exactly.
[1:47:39.480 --> 1:47:41.120]  But let's just shift gears into the larger image.
[1:47:41.120 --> 1:47:46.280]  Does the FBI and all the rest of these people get, if you try to remove this president who's
[1:47:46.280 --> 1:47:52.440]  like 65% in the polls, you know they had 15 points more in the sample, he's at 65%, that's
[1:47:52.440 --> 1:47:53.440]  why they're panicking.
[1:47:53.440 --> 1:47:57.480]  If they remove somebody who's just trying to turn the country back on and take it off
[1:47:57.480 --> 1:48:01.480]  live support and, you know, the head of Goldman Sachs is making jokes about him trying to
[1:48:01.480 --> 1:48:05.960]  turn our infrastructure on and bragging how China's better than us, I mean, doesn't Hollywood
[1:48:05.960 --> 1:48:10.760]  and the Goldman Sachs and the New World Order get that you guys could have money and power.
[1:48:10.760 --> 1:48:14.560]  We don't want war with you, but damn it, you keep trying to kill us and mount our heads
[1:48:14.560 --> 1:48:18.840]  on the wall in some, you know, measuring contest to your ding-dongs.
[1:48:18.840 --> 1:48:21.800]  I mean, man, look, we don't want a civil war.
[1:48:21.800 --> 1:48:26.840]  I got a stack of news here where Democrats are calling for hunting Republicans and killing
[1:48:26.840 --> 1:48:27.840]  everybody.
[1:48:27.840 --> 1:48:33.640]  I mean, every day they're saying, don't just kill Trump, kill everybody, kill Trump supporters,
[1:48:33.640 --> 1:48:37.560]  hunt Republicans, shoot more congressmen, you know, having in post too bad you didn't
[1:48:37.560 --> 1:48:42.960]  get more people, what, you know, you, I mean, this is out of control.
[1:48:42.960 --> 1:48:46.800]  It's like watching a toddler, you know, running around, writing on the walls with, with their
[1:48:46.800 --> 1:48:47.800]  own crap.
[1:48:47.800 --> 1:48:50.760]  I mean, I just, I don't know how much this we can put up with Dr. Corsi.
[1:48:50.760 --> 1:48:56.600]  Well, it's, it's, you're now deconstructing, uh, Megyn Kelly, and they sent Megyn Kelly
[1:48:56.600 --> 1:49:02.240]  on you in order to try to destroy you, destroy us with Info Wars, but the whole point is
[1:49:02.240 --> 1:49:03.440]  that's going to fail.
[1:49:03.440 --> 1:49:05.560]  You turned the tide on that, you taped her.
[1:49:05.560 --> 1:49:08.440]  Yeah, because it's not that we're that good, they're lying dirtbags.
[1:49:08.440 --> 1:49:09.760]  And you exposed it.
[1:49:09.760 --> 1:49:13.800]  You've shown their methodology, you've shown how they lie in the mainstream media, how
[1:49:13.800 --> 1:49:15.560]  they do hit jobs.
[1:49:15.560 --> 1:49:19.960]  You're deconstructing the mainstream media's hit job methodology.
[1:49:19.960 --> 1:49:23.920]  But Trump, why they're so afraid of Trump is once Trump really gets a hold of the Justice
[1:49:23.920 --> 1:49:30.240]  Department and, and, and finds the, uh, the Obama Clinton loyalists, gets people like
[1:49:30.240 --> 1:49:34.360]  this racial brand in charge with sessions, they're going to start to invest.
[1:49:34.360 --> 1:49:36.800]  The Clintons fired all the Republicans.
[1:49:36.800 --> 1:49:40.400]  The Clintons fired 93 US attorneys sessions, only 40 something.
[1:49:40.400 --> 1:49:41.840]  He should fire them all.
[1:49:41.840 --> 1:49:43.360]  You're all gone.
[1:49:43.360 --> 1:49:44.360]  But here's the point.
[1:49:44.360 --> 1:49:51.360]  This is why the Democrats, this is why they're so insanely going after, kill everybody, civil
[1:49:51.360 --> 1:49:58.800]  war, because once Trump begins a legitimate investigation of comies obstructed, it's over.
[1:49:58.800 --> 1:50:04.480]  Once he begins a legitimate investigation of, uh, the Clintons and the foundation and the
[1:50:04.480 --> 1:50:06.760]  Clintons and their money, they're fighting for their lives.
[1:50:06.760 --> 1:50:08.480]  They know they have, they were so arrogant.
[1:50:08.480 --> 1:50:11.000]  They thought they had the country, they thought they were invincible.
[1:50:11.000 --> 1:50:15.360]  And that's why they're fighting so hard is because they are fighting for their lives.
[1:50:15.360 --> 1:50:16.760]  And so are we folks.
[1:50:16.760 --> 1:50:19.720]  We're in an existential death battle.
[1:50:19.720 --> 1:50:21.040]  Understand that.
[1:50:21.040 --> 1:50:24.160]  I cannot hype to you how much danger the country's in.
[1:50:24.160 --> 1:50:26.600]  And by the way, we have the upper hand if we use it.
[1:50:26.600 --> 1:50:32.200]  Well, and, and the Clintons selling technology, military technology under the reset to Russia
[1:50:32.200 --> 1:50:36.600]  and getting paid for it through the Clinton Foundation for speeches, Podesta with this
[1:50:36.600 --> 1:50:41.240]  J-O-U-L-E Julie stock we found out about in the WikiLeaks.
[1:50:41.240 --> 1:50:43.960]  It's the Democrats who are scared to death.
[1:50:43.960 --> 1:50:47.120]  The legitimate Department of Justice will investigate them.
[1:50:47.120 --> 1:50:48.960]  You know what my gut tells me?
[1:50:48.960 --> 1:50:50.720]  My gut tells me it's going to be a hard road.
[1:50:50.720 --> 1:50:52.360]  We're going to win, Dr. Corsi.
[1:50:52.360 --> 1:50:55.640]  It's going to be a hard road, but I'm, I'm betting on Donald Trump.
[1:50:55.640 --> 1:50:56.640]  We're going to win.
[1:50:56.640 --> 1:50:59.000]  The only way we fail is not taking action.
[1:50:59.000 --> 1:51:00.000]  We'll be back.
[1:51:00.000 --> 1:51:04.440]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook
[1:51:04.440 --> 1:51:05.640]  food and boil water.
[1:51:05.640 --> 1:51:10.320]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's
[1:51:10.320 --> 1:51:11.520]  a much better way.
[1:51:11.520 --> 1:51:16.360]  The Minuteman rocket stove is a biomass-burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities
[1:51:16.360 --> 1:51:18.000]  of sticks and twigs for fuel.
[1:51:18.000 --> 1:51:22.080]  The Minuteman stove is easy to use, smokeless, portable, powerful, and sustainable.

[1:51:59.960 --> 1:52:04.960]  Let's go to Devin in Florida, Devin in Florida, you're on the air.
[1:52:04.960 --> 1:52:05.960]  Great.
[1:52:05.960 --> 1:52:06.960]  Hey, thank you so much.

[1:52:20.680 --> 1:52:21.680]  Wow, thank you.
[1:52:21.680 --> 1:52:22.680]  Wow.
[1:52:22.680 --> 1:52:23.680]  You're the type of listener that makes it all possible.
[1:52:23.680 --> 1:52:25.680]  Which nutraceutical does you like best?
[1:52:25.680 --> 1:52:29.560]  I really like the vitamin mineral fusion to be honest.
[1:52:29.560 --> 1:52:30.560]  It's amazing.
[1:52:30.560 --> 1:52:31.560]  It's really incredible.
[1:52:31.560 --> 1:52:35.320]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible, like I haven't felt sweet.
[1:52:35.320 --> 1:52:41.560]  My morning was fantastic and I love you guys, I love the InfoWars through and I just want
[1:52:41.560 --> 1:52:46.240]  to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence
[1:52:46.240 --> 1:52:48.440]  just buy it, you will love it.
[1:52:48.440 --> 1:52:50.840]  I'm telling you, I've never bought a bad product.
[1:52:50.840 --> 1:52:55.280]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[1:52:55.280 --> 1:53:00.280]  Just a win-win InfoWarsLife.com.
[1:53:00.280 --> 1:53:05.280]  Nearly one-third of FBI domestic terrorism cases involve refugees, one-third.
[1:53:05.280 --> 1:53:07.200]  There's already been riots across Europe.
[1:53:07.200 --> 1:53:08.200]  Is America next?
[1:53:08.200 --> 1:53:10.480]  Hi, I'm the owner of Infidel Body Armor.
[1:53:10.480 --> 1:53:14.880]  Over the past four years, I've sold thousands of body armor kits and trained hundreds of
[1:53:14.880 --> 1:53:15.880]  sheep dogs.
[1:53:15.880 --> 1:53:16.880]  They have prepared.
[1:53:16.880 --> 1:53:17.880]  Have you?
[1:53:17.880 --> 1:53:23.160]  I invite you to go to my website at InfidelBodyArmor.com and click on specials.
[1:53:23.160 --> 1:53:24.160]  Trouble is coming.
[1:53:24.160 --> 1:53:29.560]  If you want to do something about it, InfidelBodyArmor.com just won't quit.
[1:53:29.560 --> 1:53:30.560]  It's a no-brainer.
[1:53:30.560 --> 1:53:32.840]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[1:53:32.840 --> 1:53:36.840]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA, and other
[1:53:36.840 --> 1:53:40.880]  endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses, and much more, right?
[1:53:40.880 --> 1:53:42.840]  And does it all at only two cents per gallon.
[1:53:42.840 --> 1:53:46.480]  Get the original, most trusted name in gravity water filtration, Big Berkey.
[1:53:46.480 --> 1:53:51.200]  And now GCN listeners receive 5% off ceramic filter systems using code GCN.
[1:53:51.200 --> 1:53:55.600]  Call or click 1-877-99 Berkey or BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.
[1:53:55.600 --> 1:54:23.360]  That's 1-877-99 BERKEY.
[1:54:23.360 --> 1:54:27.520]  Coming up, we've got Trump's statements on Cuba.
[1:54:27.520 --> 1:54:32.720]  Let me tell you right now, Trump will tighten, but not nix Cuba traveled.
[1:54:32.720 --> 1:54:35.120]  And of course, the media focuses on travel.
[1:54:35.120 --> 1:54:40.240]  What needs to be focused on in the policies is that we're not going to let U.S. companies
[1:54:40.240 --> 1:54:45.480]  selectively go in and then pay Raul and decide the winners and losers.
[1:54:45.480 --> 1:54:48.360]  This needs to be wide open or it doesn't need to be done.
[1:54:48.360 --> 1:54:52.720]  This is so fundamental to understand globalism, crony capitalism, all of it.
[1:54:52.720 --> 1:54:57.560]  We should not allow the left and the big leftist corporations to exploit Cuba like they've
[1:54:57.560 --> 1:54:58.560]  done China.
[1:54:58.560 --> 1:55:03.640]  Well, and this is going to also be part of taking the narrative back.
[1:55:03.640 --> 1:55:08.880]  Trump is going to have a series of speeches, a series of getting back into the public,
[1:55:08.880 --> 1:55:11.440]  a series of rallies.
[1:55:11.440 --> 1:55:16.920]  But this whole idea of reversing Obama's policies on Cuba is designed to make a major
[1:55:16.920 --> 1:55:17.920]  impact.
[1:55:17.920 --> 1:55:20.760]  And I think the left will go insane on it and it's going to change the narrative away
[1:55:20.760 --> 1:55:23.120]  from obstruction.
[1:55:23.120 --> 1:55:28.720]  The point is on this obstruction issue, I think Trump is in the process of setting the
[1:55:28.720 --> 1:55:32.080]  stage for the Democrats to be under investigation.
[1:55:32.080 --> 1:55:36.880]  And when they are, when the real obstruction, which Comey's already admitted to under oath,
[1:55:36.880 --> 1:55:43.800]  he said that he obstructed, that Lorena Lynch had involved herself to ask him to tone down
[1:55:43.800 --> 1:55:47.160]  the investigation of Hillary Clinton during the campaign.
[1:55:47.160 --> 1:55:48.160]  That's obstruction.
[1:55:48.160 --> 1:55:49.600]  That's the type of issue they're looking at.
[1:55:49.600 --> 1:55:53.040]  And they know Trump's got all the intel he was covering his ass on the left of the crimes
[1:55:53.040 --> 1:55:54.040]  he committed.
[1:55:54.040 --> 1:55:57.280]  And Trump has got all the intel on the Clinton Foundation.
[1:55:57.280 --> 1:55:59.160]  You've got Charles Ortele's work.
[1:55:59.160 --> 1:56:00.160]  I wrote a book.
[1:56:00.160 --> 1:56:04.760]  Peter Schweitzer wrote a book on the Clinton crime syndicate, which is the Clinton Foundation.
[1:56:04.760 --> 1:56:06.640]  That's all going to be investigated.
[1:56:06.640 --> 1:56:07.640]  You've got Hillary.
[1:56:07.640 --> 1:56:08.640]  Stay there.
[1:56:08.640 --> 1:56:09.640]  Do five more minutes.
[1:56:09.640 --> 1:56:13.280]  And then we've got a lady who was a big establishment feminist, the father's day coming up.
[1:56:13.280 --> 1:56:16.920]  And then when she actually studied it, she saw men are going out of work, men are falling
[1:56:16.920 --> 1:56:19.680]  apart, men are committing suicide, and it's designed.
[1:56:19.680 --> 1:56:24.320]  And when men fall, women fall, the idea that men and women are separate is the most asinine.
[1:56:24.320 --> 1:56:25.320]  We're all one species.
[1:56:25.320 --> 1:56:26.320]  There is no man.
[1:56:26.320 --> 1:56:27.320]  There is no woman.
[1:56:27.320 --> 1:56:28.320]  There is humanity.
[1:56:28.320 --> 1:56:29.320]  There is our children.
[1:56:29.320 --> 1:56:31.800]  It doesn't mean we hate anybody that's into something else.
[1:56:31.800 --> 1:56:33.480]  That's all part of human expression.
[1:56:33.480 --> 1:56:34.960]  But there is a war against humanity.
[1:56:34.960 --> 1:56:35.960]  Do five more minutes with me.
[1:56:35.960 --> 1:56:40.640]  And we have this amazing guest who put out the film Red Pill and more information.
[1:56:40.640 --> 1:56:44.960]  So that's coming up briefly because Nico, he keeps explaining to me, hey, if you never
[1:56:44.960 --> 1:56:47.040]  plug, we won't be able to find the operation.
[1:56:47.040 --> 1:56:48.040]  We have record audience.
[1:56:48.040 --> 1:56:52.800]  We have biggest audits we've ever had for the summertime, bigger than it was last year
[1:56:52.800 --> 1:56:54.200]  during the campaign.
[1:56:54.200 --> 1:56:58.480]  But financially, they took about $5 million of our advertising away, banning us on Google
[1:56:58.480 --> 1:56:59.480]  ads.
[1:56:59.480 --> 1:57:01.040]  And we've barely tried to make that back.
[1:57:01.040 --> 1:57:02.040]  It sounds like a lot of money.
[1:57:02.040 --> 1:57:05.400]  It's not when you're trying to set up bureaus in D.C. and London and much of the stuff we
[1:57:05.400 --> 1:57:06.400]  got going.
[1:57:06.400 --> 1:57:07.400]  We need funding.
[1:57:07.400 --> 1:57:08.400]  So we don't just ask for donations.
[1:57:08.400 --> 1:57:12.480]  We just say, hey, get great nutraceuticals, great water filtration systems, great Patriot
[1:57:12.480 --> 1:57:15.040]  apparel to meet like-minded people, you name it.
[1:57:15.040 --> 1:57:16.280]  We have free shipping, by the way.
[1:57:16.280 --> 1:57:17.680]  We do that only a few times a year.
[1:57:17.680 --> 1:57:19.840]  That's running through next week at infowarstore.com.
[1:57:19.840 --> 1:57:25.720]  If you sign up for auto shipping, additional 10% off, but it doesn't matter.
[1:57:25.720 --> 1:57:31.800]  It's great fluoride-free iodine slash tea tree oil slash peppermint slash colloidal
[1:57:31.800 --> 1:57:32.800]  silver toothpaste.
[1:57:32.800 --> 1:57:33.800]  Nobody ever did that.
[1:57:33.800 --> 1:57:36.760]  And we have the biggest manufacturer of organic toothpaste in the country making it.
[1:57:36.760 --> 1:57:37.760]  That's the best seller.
[1:57:37.760 --> 1:57:43.120]  We've got the X2 Good Halogen with the Biotrycellinium that go together electrochemically.
[1:57:43.120 --> 1:57:45.400]  Just see what Mother Nature does, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:57:45.400 --> 1:57:46.400]  That's available.
[1:57:46.400 --> 1:57:47.400]  That's 25% off.
[1:57:47.400 --> 1:57:53.400]  A lot of specials at infowarstore.com or call toll-free, triple-eight, two-five, three-three-one-three-nine.
[1:57:53.400 --> 1:57:59.520]  And I could not impress upon you how critical it is to buy the products.
[1:57:59.520 --> 1:58:00.880]  They're great products you need.
[1:58:00.880 --> 1:58:03.880]  They're great products that have made my life so much better.
[1:58:03.880 --> 1:58:08.480]  But it also funds an organization that's changing the world.
[1:58:08.480 --> 1:58:12.840]  This is the equivalent of war bonds in World War II or the equivalent of George Washington
[1:58:12.840 --> 1:58:17.680]  having to sell little American flags to try to get money to buy bullets.
[1:58:17.680 --> 1:58:21.720]  If we don't have the bullets, we can't prosecute the war.
[1:58:21.720 --> 1:58:24.840]  And I don't want to just sit here and stasis the same size.
[1:58:24.840 --> 1:58:26.600]  Big fish eat little fish.
[1:58:26.600 --> 1:58:29.360]  We need to get big in the face of the enemy.
[1:58:29.360 --> 1:58:30.360]  Like Doomsday.
[1:58:30.360 --> 1:58:31.360]  But the Good Doomsday.
[1:58:31.360 --> 1:58:33.080]  We're Doomsday to the New World Order.
[1:58:33.080 --> 1:58:35.840]  I mean, you know, every time they've hit us, we've gotten bigger.
[1:58:35.840 --> 1:58:39.360]  We need to do that equation one more time and we win.
[1:58:39.360 --> 1:58:42.160]  Buy products today at infowarstore.com.

[1:59:32.160 --> 1:59:33.440]  is most important.
[1:59:33.440 --> 1:59:38.680]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant derived or of the highest

[1:59:55.560 --> 1:59:59.560]  Yeah, if you want to go into communist China folks, you got to go to their generals.
[1:59:59.560 --> 2:00:06.560]  Same thing in Cuba.
[2:00:06.560 --> 2:00:12.240]  Bullet is the bone.
[2:00:12.240 --> 2:00:14.880]  Waging war on corruption.
[2:00:14.880 --> 2:00:37.680]  This is Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[2:00:37.680 --> 2:00:42.080]  We actually have President Trump's press release talking points.
[2:00:42.080 --> 2:00:45.560]  We need to get that published if you can during the break on infowars.com and I'm sure anybody
[2:00:45.560 --> 2:00:46.560]  has this yet.
[2:00:46.560 --> 2:00:47.560]  We just got the text.
[2:00:47.560 --> 2:00:49.280]  They're just released by the White House right now.
[2:00:49.280 --> 2:00:51.960]  Yeah, to us first, so we need to get that out.
[2:00:51.960 --> 2:00:56.680]  Of course, he literally gets stuff a lot of times, 20 minutes for anybody else does,
[2:00:56.680 --> 2:00:57.680]  from who he won't say.
[2:00:57.680 --> 2:01:00.720]  But let's just say hi up in the federal government.
[2:01:00.720 --> 2:01:06.800]  Looking at this unfolding, it's exactly what I said without even hearing Trump's full speech.
[2:01:06.800 --> 2:01:10.320]  The Chinese military runs who can come into China into a business through combines.
[2:01:10.320 --> 2:01:16.240]  It's the same thing in Cuba and we're saying, if you went open Cuba, let Cuban individuals
[2:01:16.240 --> 2:01:19.040]  deal directly with any company they want.
[2:01:19.040 --> 2:01:23.200]  Don't let a bunch of fat cat generals come in and exploit the amazing, hardworking, beautiful
[2:01:23.200 --> 2:01:24.200]  Cuban people.
[2:01:24.200 --> 2:01:27.160]  And then sure enough, we've got the actual White House policy.
[2:01:27.160 --> 2:01:28.160]  Tell folks, Dr. Corsi.
[2:01:28.160 --> 2:01:35.240]  Well, the policy channels economic activities away from the Cuban military monopoly.
[2:01:35.240 --> 2:01:41.080]  It includes a whole series of travel related transactions that will allow American individuals
[2:01:41.080 --> 2:01:47.840]  and businesses to develop economic ties to the private small business sector in Cuba.
[2:01:47.840 --> 2:01:52.400]  The new policy makes clear that the primary obstacles to the Cuban people's prosperity
[2:01:52.400 --> 2:01:58.240]  and economic freedom is the Cuban military's practice of controlling virtually every profitable
[2:01:58.240 --> 2:01:59.240]  sector of the economy.
[2:01:59.240 --> 2:02:05.520]  And that is such a gift to the Cuban people, that's such a verdant, beautiful, diverse
[2:02:05.520 --> 2:02:06.520]  country.
[2:02:06.520 --> 2:02:09.320]  I mean, from what I've read and what I've seen, Cuba is a jewel.
[2:02:09.320 --> 2:02:10.320]  Right.
[2:02:10.320 --> 2:02:15.720]  President Trump's policy changes will encourage American commerce and free Cuban businesses
[2:02:15.720 --> 2:02:21.320]  to pressure the Cuban government to allow the Cuban people to expand the private sector.
[2:02:21.320 --> 2:02:25.320]  Cuba's under a dictatorship and I'm so sick of Jesse Ventura, who's a nice guy overall
[2:02:25.320 --> 2:02:29.120]  and others, this fiddle, patting him on the head, making excuses for it.
[2:02:29.120 --> 2:02:31.280]  They killed hundreds of thousands of people.
[2:02:31.280 --> 2:02:32.280]  Right.
[2:02:32.280 --> 2:02:37.640]  And this reverses Obama's whole policy, which would have played into the hands of the...
[2:02:37.640 --> 2:02:41.400]  Doesn't the Cuban military get the power structure that either rich guys there?
[2:02:41.400 --> 2:02:42.560]  It's like blank find.
[2:02:42.560 --> 2:02:45.440]  They make record money at Goldman Sachs, but still want to stop Trump because some of the
[2:02:45.440 --> 2:02:46.440]  money's getting to the people.
[2:02:46.440 --> 2:02:50.080]  Doesn't the Cuban military know if they get out of the way, they're already in dominant
[2:02:50.080 --> 2:02:52.160]  positions, they'll make 50 times the money?
[2:02:52.160 --> 2:02:53.160]  It's the global...
[2:02:53.160 --> 2:02:54.160]  They're idiots.
[2:02:54.160 --> 2:02:57.760]  The globalist strategy is a suicidal strategy that...
[2:02:57.760 --> 2:02:59.120]  A menacing returns.
[2:02:59.120 --> 2:03:01.000]  That Hillary wants to follow.
[2:03:01.000 --> 2:03:02.400]  I mean, Hillary, Obama...
[2:03:02.400 --> 2:03:05.600]  We were talking to high-level folks this morning, and they all get it, that this globalism
[2:03:05.600 --> 2:03:06.600]  does...
[2:03:06.600 --> 2:03:07.880]  Isn't good for business.
[2:03:07.880 --> 2:03:11.120]  But it's good for the very, very rich at the very, very...
[2:03:11.120 --> 2:03:13.200]  They're good for jerks when everybody else's poor.
[2:03:13.200 --> 2:03:16.680]  They let Obama buy a house in Washington and put up a wall.
[2:03:16.680 --> 2:03:19.880]  They let Hillary live in two or three houses when she's really accrued...
[2:03:19.880 --> 2:03:20.880]  Two or three?
[2:03:20.880 --> 2:03:21.880]  She's got like 10.
[2:03:21.880 --> 2:03:25.720]  She's got with the Clinton Foundation, which has stolen money from everybody, including
[2:03:25.720 --> 2:03:26.720]  Hayesha.
[2:03:26.720 --> 2:03:31.240]  But then Obama goes to Africa and says, you can't have cars or air condition.
[2:03:31.240 --> 2:03:32.240]  Right.
[2:03:32.240 --> 2:03:36.120]  And see, the people under these policies, just like in America, you end up with 92 million
[2:03:36.120 --> 2:03:38.960]  people who can't find a job, who want work.
[2:03:38.960 --> 2:03:43.080]  The globalists don't care because they're having all the money at the top, and they
[2:03:43.080 --> 2:03:44.080]  have...
[2:03:44.080 --> 2:03:45.080]  It's a suicide...
[2:03:45.080 --> 2:03:48.360]  And then they have the nerve to come out and say, hunt and kill Republicans, the Democrats
[2:03:48.360 --> 2:03:52.560]  that put out the hashtag, because they're rich and aren't giving you the money.
[2:03:52.560 --> 2:03:53.560]  Dumbasses.
[2:03:53.560 --> 2:03:54.560]  Free markets.
[2:03:54.560 --> 2:03:57.600]  What gives you the money and the spaceships and the medicine?
[2:03:57.600 --> 2:03:59.680]  Not Venezuela, not North Korea, not Cuba.
[2:03:59.680 --> 2:04:00.680]  Yeah.
[2:04:00.680 --> 2:04:03.400]  They got more doctors per capita, anywhere in the world in Cuba.
[2:04:03.400 --> 2:04:05.560]  And when your knee goes out, they give you a cane.
[2:04:05.560 --> 2:04:08.160]  When your eyes go out, they give you a cane.
[2:04:08.160 --> 2:04:12.240]  And also, I think it's demonstration that the White House is listening to what we're
[2:04:12.240 --> 2:04:13.240]  talking about.
[2:04:13.240 --> 2:04:19.760]  I laid out a three-part policy as to how you'd beat this propaganda campaign of the
[2:04:19.760 --> 2:04:20.760]  Democrats.
[2:04:20.760 --> 2:04:21.760]  First, you change the subject.
[2:04:21.760 --> 2:04:24.000]  Again, Donald Trump's changed subject today.
[2:04:24.000 --> 2:04:27.480]  Cuba's going to be the news cycle through the weekend.
[2:04:27.480 --> 2:04:30.520]  Secondly, you have to silence the mainstream media.
[2:04:30.520 --> 2:04:34.160]  Get them out of the White House, press room, act up hour on TV.
[2:04:34.160 --> 2:04:36.600]  And third, you've got a counterattack.
[2:04:36.600 --> 2:04:41.880]  And Kassavich, the new attorney that Trump has in the White House, is doing a brilliant,
[2:04:41.880 --> 2:04:42.880]  I think, strategy...
[2:04:42.880 --> 2:04:47.560]  That's right, because we've got Sessions recusing, and now we've got the Deputy recusing.
[2:04:47.560 --> 2:04:51.560]  She's in charge now, and the word is she'll actually execute Order Number 66.
[2:04:51.560 --> 2:05:01.280]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[2:05:01.280 --> 2:05:06.320]  Following the liberal outcry over Megyn Kelly interviewing Alex Jones, NBC News executives
[2:05:06.320 --> 2:05:09.920]  have been scrambling to further edit their hit piece on Alex Jones.
[2:05:09.920 --> 2:05:14.320]  The word now is that Megyn Kelly has changed her Sunday night show featuring Alex Jones'
[2:05:14.320 --> 2:05:19.640]  interview by inviting Sandy Hook Families on to play edited clips of Alex talking while
[2:05:19.640 --> 2:05:22.360]  they have the parents emotionally respond.
[2:05:22.360 --> 2:05:26.640]  One thing is for sure, with how long it's taking NBC to edit Megyn Kelly's interview
[2:05:26.640 --> 2:05:31.600]  with Alex Jones prior to just airing it, we can expect that they will be misrepresenting
[2:05:31.600 --> 2:05:34.280]  his statements with skilled editing techniques.
[2:05:34.280 --> 2:05:38.880]  Why not just release the entire interview unedited and prove you're not fake news, NBC?
[2:05:38.880 --> 2:05:43.720]  They'd like you to believe that Alex Jones, not Adam Lanza, is the real bad guy in the
[2:05:43.720 --> 2:05:48.400]  Sandy Hook Massacre, because he said he believes there was a government conspiracy at work.
[2:05:48.400 --> 2:05:53.480]  However, all of this will backfire on the mainstream media, as everyday Americans are increasingly
[2:05:53.480 --> 2:05:58.360]  becoming more aware of the staging, faking, and lying that is the mainstream media.
[2:05:58.360 --> 2:06:00.360]  For more reports, go to infowars.com.
[2:06:00.360 --> 2:06:06.920]  Let's go to Dabbit in Florida, Dabbit in Florida, you're on the air.
[2:06:06.920 --> 2:06:12.680]  Great, hey, thank you so much, listen, I have bought your product and I gotta say they're
[2:06:12.680 --> 2:06:13.680]  amazing.
[2:06:13.680 --> 2:06:19.080]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it, because I've got caveman, superman of vitality, secret
[2:06:19.080 --> 2:06:22.680]  swell, vitamin and infusion, I've got the body armor.
[2:06:22.680 --> 2:06:23.680]  Wow, thank you.
[2:06:23.680 --> 2:06:26.040]  You're the type of listener that makes it all possible.
[2:06:26.040 --> 2:06:27.680]  Which nutraceuticals do you like best?
[2:06:27.680 --> 2:06:32.400]  I really like the vitamin mineral fusion to be honest, that's really incredible.
[2:06:32.400 --> 2:06:36.520]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible, like I haven't felt
[2:06:36.520 --> 2:06:37.520]  anything.
[2:06:37.520 --> 2:06:43.120]  My morning was fantastic and I love the guys, I love the info wars through and I just want
[2:06:43.120 --> 2:06:47.720]  to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence,
[2:06:47.720 --> 2:06:52.120]  John, buy it, you will love it, I'm telling you, I've never bought a bad product.
[2:06:52.120 --> 2:06:56.520]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at infowarslife.com.
[2:06:56.520 --> 2:07:00.920]  It's a win-win infowarslife.com.
[2:07:00.920 --> 2:07:09.020]  I've spent seven years off and on trying to get a big national brand that's already
[2:07:09.020 --> 2:07:14.360]  trusted to let us private label an entire line of personal care products that's organic
[2:07:14.360 --> 2:07:15.360]  and high quality.
[2:07:15.360 --> 2:07:21.600]  This is one of the top three selling organic brands in the country that puts out high quality
[2:07:21.600 --> 2:07:24.560]  organic shampoo, mouthwash, you name it.
[2:07:24.560 --> 2:07:29.040]  And they're such patriots, they have let us basically keep their well-known packaging.
[2:07:29.040 --> 2:07:33.080]  It is an answer to prayer and because we're cutting out the middleman, 20% off retail,
[2:07:33.080 --> 2:07:36.240]  sign up for auto-ship, an additional 25% off.
[2:07:36.240 --> 2:07:41.440]  It's all there, the body wash, the shampoo, the deodorant, the mouthwash, all of it is
[2:07:41.440 --> 2:07:42.760]  truly game-changing.
[2:07:42.760 --> 2:07:47.320]  It is the exact same product, just the name is different, EmRick's Essentials and it's
[2:07:47.320 --> 2:07:53.600]  on average 20% off what it would be in stores buying it directly from infowarsstore.com.
[2:07:53.600 --> 2:07:58.000]  Help us win the info war while getting products everybody needs, infowarslife.com where you'll
[2:07:58.000 --> 2:08:12.000]  find the entire line of EmRick's Essentials.
[2:08:12.000 --> 2:08:16.960]  The film is the red pill, we're about to be talking to the director of the documentary.
[2:08:16.960 --> 2:08:25.880]  Our investigation changed her view of the world, here's the trailer.
[2:08:25.880 --> 2:08:30.200]  One in three American women and equal rights for women in the U.S.
[2:08:30.200 --> 2:08:35.400]  Have been found guilty of raping a West Virginia teenager.
[2:08:35.400 --> 2:08:39.560]  The sojournist rantings would be at home in the far-reaching internet subculture, widely
[2:08:39.560 --> 2:08:41.880]  described as the men's rights movement.
[2:08:41.880 --> 2:08:46.360]  Declaring the month of October to be bashed a violent f***ing.
[2:08:46.360 --> 2:08:55.160]  I decided to go where no feminist has gone before and meet these men's rights activists.
[2:08:55.160 --> 2:09:00.240]  Women and boys are in prices and they need your support because they are human beings
[2:09:00.240 --> 2:09:09.160]  too and you will not shame anybody here into silence about it anymore.
[2:09:09.160 --> 2:09:16.000]  Every society survived based on its ability to train its sons to be disposable.
[2:09:16.000 --> 2:09:20.680]  The U.S. government does not want to send you to die, rather than me to die.
[2:09:20.680 --> 2:09:25.920]  53% of workplace fatalities are men, four of five suicides.
[2:09:25.920 --> 2:09:30.120]  The family court system truly is biased against men, I mean there's just no question about
[2:09:30.120 --> 2:09:31.120]  it.
[2:09:31.120 --> 2:09:33.000]  How can anybody not be angered by it?
[2:09:33.000 --> 2:09:36.600]  But if you start to talk about those issues, people get hostile.
[2:09:36.600 --> 2:09:37.600]  We're f***ing stoned.
[2:09:37.600 --> 2:09:46.640]  We're somehow disempowered because we're right in bed, maybe it's just because you're
[2:09:46.640 --> 2:09:47.640]  pathetic.
[2:09:47.640 --> 2:09:51.680]  If those people live by it, men have all the power, women don't make the same money for
[2:09:51.680 --> 2:09:55.000]  the same work, that is feminist training.
[2:09:55.000 --> 2:09:57.640]  Flexibility and roles is where we should be all headed.
[2:09:57.640 --> 2:10:01.360]  So where do the men's movement and feminism disagree?
[2:10:01.360 --> 2:10:07.440]  Is the men's rights movement the gender version of the white nationalist movement?
[2:10:07.440 --> 2:10:10.120]  The men's rights movement is part of the backwards.
[2:10:10.120 --> 2:10:15.360]  Grandfather's generation probably had it pretty well, well, you know, grow up.
[2:10:15.360 --> 2:10:18.640]  She told her friend she's going to trick me into fathering the child.
[2:10:18.640 --> 2:10:21.960]  I called a bunch of domestic violence shelters.
[2:10:21.960 --> 2:10:24.440]  Every place said, we don't help men.
[2:10:24.440 --> 2:10:28.880]  Whenever he courted my domestic assault, I did not bring up the fact that I was sexually
[2:10:28.880 --> 2:10:29.880]  assaulted.
[2:10:29.880 --> 2:10:34.200]  There was no way he was going to believe that I was going to be a victim of sexual assault.
[2:10:34.200 --> 2:10:37.800]  Although evils are worlds from Patrick, I think that we're the ones dying and we die
[2:10:37.800 --> 2:10:38.800]  for you guys.
[2:10:38.800 --> 2:10:40.800]  I don't know where I'm headed, what I believe.
[2:10:40.800 --> 2:10:46.800]  This is not flattering to men, it's to talk about men's vulnerabilities.
[2:10:46.800 --> 2:10:54.800]  We're not blaming men, we just named everything bad after them.
[2:10:54.800 --> 2:10:58.840]  I think I agree with everything you said, but there's still some kind of unsettling
[2:10:58.840 --> 2:11:02.320]  doubt.
[2:11:02.320 --> 2:11:06.120]  Talk about great work and of course Mike Starnovich is involved in this film as well, that is
[2:11:06.120 --> 2:11:07.120]  just so exciting.
[2:11:07.120 --> 2:11:12.680]  I'm going to close in the fourth hour today, I'm going to go to our guest here in just
[2:11:12.680 --> 2:11:20.440]  a moment, but I just want to point out that it's so ridiculous, it's like saying, are
[2:11:20.440 --> 2:11:23.640]  male and female whales oppressing each other?
[2:11:23.640 --> 2:11:28.840]  Or are male and female toucans, like who's bad, the male toucan or the female toucan?
[2:11:28.840 --> 2:11:34.040]  You're like, no, those are birds, that's a species and the male goes off and gets worms
[2:11:34.040 --> 2:11:37.680]  and stuff and fruit and brings it back to the mom, it's not that she's a slave, she's
[2:11:37.680 --> 2:11:42.480]  having the eggs, she's sitting on top of them, men don't have a unit, women do.
[2:11:42.480 --> 2:11:52.960]  It's the species, men and women are the species, and this hasn't been done by accident.
[2:11:52.960 --> 2:11:57.400]  The social engineers admit they want to totally scramble things.
[2:11:57.400 --> 2:12:01.800]  They knew, they started saying women go to work and pay taxes and don't give your kids
[2:12:01.800 --> 2:12:07.200]  breast milk that they were trying to remove women from the family so that the family could
[2:12:07.200 --> 2:12:11.600]  be terminated and so that a whole new civilization could be set up.
[2:12:11.600 --> 2:12:14.640]  Humans are being turned into machines, does that not mean there aren't cultures where
[2:12:14.640 --> 2:12:17.040]  men end up oppressing women?
[2:12:17.040 --> 2:12:23.120]  Of course, it's like ants go out and hijack and kidnap aphids and then bring them down
[2:12:23.120 --> 2:12:27.000]  into their subterranean lairs and enslave them.
[2:12:27.000 --> 2:12:34.320]  This stuff goes on, but you have to look at the whole process.
[2:12:34.320 --> 2:12:39.960]  You have to look at the whole process and see how it's scientific and then pull back
[2:12:39.960 --> 2:12:43.800]  from it and see how they're atomizing us all.
[2:12:43.800 --> 2:12:49.560]  They're all isolating everybody and men aren't going to college, men are in every metric
[2:12:49.560 --> 2:12:53.400]  just imploding, falling apart, is that like, yay, women are getting ahead, you know, there's
[2:12:53.400 --> 2:13:00.240]  a photo on DrudgeReport.com of like more than a decade ago of Rachel Maddow and Tucker
[2:13:00.240 --> 2:13:04.200]  Carlson on TV together and Rachel Maddow looks like a woman.
[2:13:04.200 --> 2:13:05.200]  She looks cute.
[2:13:05.200 --> 2:13:08.640]  It's not bad if she wants to look like a man, but it's what they start to get in Megyn
[2:13:08.640 --> 2:13:09.840]  Kelly to look like a man.
[2:13:09.840 --> 2:13:12.680]  It's like, what are they doing?
[2:13:12.680 --> 2:13:15.520]  The goal is to get rid of the sexes.
[2:13:15.520 --> 2:13:18.480]  Now they've got 100 plus sexual preferences on Facebook.
[2:13:18.480 --> 2:13:24.080]  It's not about freedom, it's about attacking being male and being female.
[2:13:24.080 --> 2:13:26.200]  It's social engineering.
[2:13:26.200 --> 2:13:32.640]  So Cassie J is a filmmaker based in San Francisco Bay Area and founder and CEO of Jane Bird
[2:13:32.640 --> 2:13:33.640]  Productions.
[2:13:33.640 --> 2:13:34.640]  I'm just, I'm just so excited about this.
[2:13:34.640 --> 2:13:38.960]  She has directed and produced over a dozen films and documentaries, but it's most known
[2:13:38.960 --> 2:13:41.240]  for her future documentaries.
[2:13:41.240 --> 2:13:46.440]  Daddy I do about purity balls, but absence is pledges.
[2:13:46.440 --> 2:13:49.440]  I think of absence pledges where your kids go crazy.
[2:13:49.440 --> 2:13:53.400]  The right to love an American family about the fight for same-sex marriage rights and
[2:13:53.400 --> 2:13:58.080]  her latest film, The Red Pill, which examines men's rights movement.
[2:13:58.080 --> 2:13:59.800]  And again, that film is now out.
[2:13:59.800 --> 2:14:03.800]  She won 15 awards, including Best Documentary at the Cannes Independent Film Festival in
[2:14:03.800 --> 2:14:10.600]  France and she joins us now the redpillmovie.com and again, winner of the excellence in directing
[2:14:10.600 --> 2:14:14.640]  documentary, just a whole bunch of other awards she's gotten.
[2:14:14.640 --> 2:14:16.880]  So Ms. J, good to have you on with us.
[2:14:16.880 --> 2:14:18.440]  Wow, what a powerful film.
[2:14:18.440 --> 2:14:20.880]  I can't wait to show it to my children.
[2:14:20.880 --> 2:14:22.880]  Oh, thank you.
[2:14:22.880 --> 2:14:28.280]  I put a lot into three and a half years of making a red pill, so I hope it helps people
[2:14:28.280 --> 2:14:30.240]  better understand the genders.
[2:14:30.240 --> 2:14:31.240]  Absolutely.
[2:14:31.240 --> 2:14:33.400]  Well, of course, there are no genders now.
[2:14:33.400 --> 2:14:34.480]  There is no male or female.
[2:14:34.480 --> 2:14:38.480]  There's only the new big pharma and five daddies, five mommies.
[2:14:38.480 --> 2:14:40.680]  And if you're a gay guy, you have five daddies.
[2:14:40.680 --> 2:14:44.040]  If you're a woman, you have five mommies because men and women are separate and are at war
[2:14:44.040 --> 2:14:45.040]  with each other.
[2:14:45.040 --> 2:14:53.080]  Well, before making a red pill, I was a sponge feminist of about 10 years, and that really
[2:14:53.080 --> 2:14:58.520]  shaped the way that I looked at men and women and making a red pill gave me new insight
[2:14:58.520 --> 2:15:05.840]  into the disadvantages that men have and the advantages that women have.
[2:15:05.840 --> 2:15:10.400]  Break down your process or just how, I mean, how the film started out.
[2:15:10.400 --> 2:15:16.880]  And then, I mean, obviously, you've seen the film, you know, as you start to become,
[2:15:16.880 --> 2:15:21.240]  I guess, conflicted, you know, trying to juxtapose all this.
[2:15:21.240 --> 2:15:25.040]  Well, so it was March 2013.
[2:15:25.040 --> 2:15:26.920]  I was looking for my next film project.
[2:15:26.920 --> 2:15:31.160]  I just completed Right to Love, which was about gay marriage before it was legal across
[2:15:31.160 --> 2:15:32.680]  the nation.
[2:15:32.680 --> 2:15:37.880]  And I thought I was going to make a film about rape culture because that was blowing up my
[2:15:37.880 --> 2:15:38.880]  newsfeed.
[2:15:38.880 --> 2:15:43.480]  And so I started looking into rape culture, and they commonly talk about rape apologists
[2:15:43.480 --> 2:15:47.400]  and people who are perpetuating rape culture blame the victim.
[2:15:47.400 --> 2:15:52.720]  So I tried to find these rape apologists, and that led me down the Googling rabbit hole
[2:15:52.720 --> 2:15:58.720]  that took me to a voiceformen.com, which is one of the largest men's rights groups and
[2:15:58.720 --> 2:16:01.120]  forums online.
[2:16:01.120 --> 2:16:04.600]  And I was shocked by what I was reading on A Voice for Men.
[2:16:04.600 --> 2:16:10.120]  I had never heard of these different talking points before, and also there had never been
[2:16:10.120 --> 2:16:11.960]  a film about the men's rights movement.
[2:16:11.960 --> 2:16:17.760]  And they really started to get going around the 70s, but they didn't catch when feminism,
[2:16:17.760 --> 2:16:19.840]  the second way feminism did.
[2:16:19.840 --> 2:16:26.520]  But Warren Farrell made or authored the book The Myth and Male Power in the 90s, and that
[2:16:26.520 --> 2:16:31.120]  led to a lot of these men's rights groups springing up like a voice for men.
[2:16:31.120 --> 2:16:35.560]  So this had never been explored in a film before, and as a feminist, I thought I'm going
[2:16:35.560 --> 2:16:41.200]  to go interview these men's rights activists and expose them for what they truly are.
[2:16:41.200 --> 2:16:46.880]  And I thought that was going to be showing the men who perpetuate rape culture and are
[2:16:46.880 --> 2:16:51.840]  misogynists and want to put them back in the kitchen barefoot and pregnant.
[2:16:51.840 --> 2:16:56.120]  And if you watch the Red Pill film, you'll see that the truth was not that.
[2:16:56.120 --> 2:16:58.360]  Well, I know this.
[2:16:58.360 --> 2:17:01.600]  The globalists say they want to replace us all with robots that say the future doesn't
[2:17:01.600 --> 2:17:02.600]  need us.
[2:17:02.600 --> 2:17:07.640]  Humanity itself is all breathing the same toxic garbage that led to mercury.
[2:17:07.640 --> 2:17:08.640]  All of us male-female.
[2:17:08.640 --> 2:17:14.680]  I have male family that dies of cancer, female family that dies of cancer.
[2:17:14.680 --> 2:17:20.080]  And the species has to develop systems for ourselves.
[2:17:20.080 --> 2:17:23.400]  Just for me, I just don't even see any division.
[2:17:23.400 --> 2:17:28.960]  Clearly, in every mammal species, males take the risk, but females take the risk of then
[2:17:28.960 --> 2:17:31.040]  having the babies and going through all that stress.
[2:17:31.040 --> 2:17:33.200]  Females are stronger genetically.
[2:17:33.200 --> 2:17:34.600]  Females carry a second set of DNA.
[2:17:34.600 --> 2:17:38.680]  If you want to get into real genetic engineering, there's only females.
[2:17:38.680 --> 2:17:45.160]  And then females basically then produce some males with attributes for going out and foraging
[2:17:45.160 --> 2:17:47.200]  and then bringing back food.
[2:17:47.200 --> 2:17:49.400]  And then now we're in this more modern society.
[2:17:49.400 --> 2:17:54.040]  And so the attack on males is an attack on women, is an attack on the species by a scientific
[2:17:54.040 --> 2:17:55.040]  elitist.
[2:17:55.040 --> 2:17:58.400]  If you study the larger picture, this is a very sophisticated.
[2:17:58.400 --> 2:17:59.400]  Yes.
[2:17:59.400 --> 2:18:07.160]  Yeah, I think so feminists have said that the men's rights movement is backlash to feminism.
[2:18:07.160 --> 2:18:14.200]  And I think in some ways that is correct because feminism and how it's grown and its prominence
[2:18:14.200 --> 2:18:23.840]  and kind of popularity, especially in the past 10 years with social media, it has defined
[2:18:23.840 --> 2:18:27.520]  what we should think about genders and when we should get offended, and such as if you
[2:18:27.520 --> 2:18:28.520]  say that.
[2:18:28.520 --> 2:18:29.520]  Exactly.
[2:18:29.520 --> 2:18:33.040]  They're defining what genders are and reality.
[2:18:33.040 --> 2:18:34.040]  They're setting themselves.
[2:18:34.040 --> 2:18:35.040]  It's not even women.
[2:18:35.040 --> 2:18:37.920]  The social engineers are setting themselves up as the new priesthood.
[2:18:37.920 --> 2:18:39.480]  It's a new religion.
[2:18:39.480 --> 2:18:44.880]  Well, in a lot of ways, I would agree with you on that and I know I'm going to get a
[2:18:44.880 --> 2:18:45.880]  lot of flack for that.
[2:18:45.880 --> 2:18:48.680]  I'm not even going to get flack for being on the show, but thank you for having me on
[2:18:48.680 --> 2:18:49.680]  there.
[2:18:49.680 --> 2:18:50.680]  That's a good thing.
[2:18:50.680 --> 2:18:55.960]  But yeah, I also left a religion when I was in my late teens and that's when I became
[2:18:55.960 --> 2:18:56.960]  feminist.
[2:18:56.960 --> 2:19:01.920]  And after making the Red Pill movie, I dropped the label of feminism and in a lot of ways,
[2:19:01.920 --> 2:19:07.360]  I know this is going to offend a lot of people, but in a lot of ways, my leaving a religion
[2:19:07.360 --> 2:19:12.280]  and also leaving feminism was a very similar experience for me.
[2:19:12.280 --> 2:19:17.680]  And so it does completely change your worldview and that's why the film is called the Red
[2:19:17.680 --> 2:19:18.680]  Pill.
[2:19:18.680 --> 2:19:21.280]  I cannot see the world the same way again and I don't think anyone who does watch the
[2:19:21.280 --> 2:19:22.880]  film can see the world the same way again.
[2:19:22.880 --> 2:19:27.200]  Well, you just said it's so powerful because it just clicked for me.
[2:19:27.200 --> 2:19:30.720]  Out of these false religions and controlled systems, we get self-confidence, but if you
[2:19:30.720 --> 2:19:37.040]  truly get into humanity and our great struggle and our ancestors and this great saga we've
[2:19:37.040 --> 2:19:40.480]  been through, that's the great empowerment.
[2:19:40.480 --> 2:19:43.520]  That's the confidence that's coming together.
[2:19:43.520 --> 2:19:48.720]  And I think the greatest wound to modern third-wave feminism is its endorsement of radical Islam.
[2:19:48.720 --> 2:19:49.720]  It's a total mental illness.
[2:19:49.720 --> 2:19:51.240]  I want to get your take on that.
[2:19:51.240 --> 2:19:58.040]  The lady that directed and produced all these other great folks, the Red Pill, is our guest.
[2:19:58.040 --> 2:19:59.040]  Very, very excited.

[2:20:04.040 --> 2:20:08.080]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA, and other

[2:20:29.800 --> 2:20:34.800]  Nearly one-third of FBI domestic terrorism cases involve refugees.
[2:20:34.800 --> 2:20:35.800]  One-third.
[2:20:35.800 --> 2:20:37.800]  There's already been riots across Europe.
[2:20:37.800 --> 2:20:38.800]  Is America next?
[2:20:38.800 --> 2:20:40.800]  Hi, I'm the owner of Infidel Body Armor.
[2:20:40.800 --> 2:20:45.800]  Over the past four years, I've sold thousands of body armor kits and trained hundreds of
[2:20:45.800 --> 2:20:46.800]  sheep dogs.
[2:20:46.800 --> 2:20:47.800]  They have prepared.
[2:20:47.800 --> 2:20:48.800]  Have you?
[2:20:48.800 --> 2:20:53.800]  I invite you to go to my website at infidelbodyarmor.com and click on specials.
[2:20:53.800 --> 2:20:54.800]  Trouble is coming.
[2:20:54.800 --> 2:20:56.800]  Now do something about it.
[2:20:56.800 --> 2:20:59.800]  Body armor.com just won't quit.
[2:21:26.800 --> 2:21:30.800]  I have a HarvestRite freeze dryer and use it to preserve the foods I love.
[2:21:30.800 --> 2:21:35.800]  Strawberries, apples, and even lasagna and ice cream can stay fresh for 25 years.
[2:21:35.800 --> 2:21:40.800]  And the best part of my freeze drying is my family and I have a supply of long-lasting
[2:21:40.800 --> 2:21:41.800]  food on hand.
[2:21:41.800 --> 2:21:44.800]  So no matter what may come, we feel better prepared.
[2:21:44.800 --> 2:21:46.800]  We love our freeze dryer.

[2:22:23.800 --> 2:22:26.800]  The ShelterPod at ShelterPod.com.
[2:22:26.800 --> 2:22:55.800]  The ShelterPod at ShelterPod.com.
[2:22:56.800 --> 2:22:58.800]  Available at amazon.com.
[2:23:27.800 --> 2:23:32.800]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[2:23:32.800 --> 2:23:38.800]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative
[2:23:38.800 --> 2:24:07.800]  to keep their cardio-vascular system healthy.
[2:24:07.800 --> 2:24:09.800]  Cassie J's our guest.
[2:24:09.800 --> 2:24:17.800]  Her film's been banned in theaters in Australia because she just dared go out and have humanity,
[2:24:17.800 --> 2:24:20.800]  not woman, not male, just humanity.
[2:24:20.800 --> 2:24:22.800]  And look, let's get one thing straight.
[2:24:22.800 --> 2:24:30.800]  Men act like a bunch of lazy animals in an unshillared society.
[2:24:30.800 --> 2:24:32.800]  And humans have always abused each other.
[2:24:32.800 --> 2:24:34.800]  Women have abused men, men women.
[2:24:34.800 --> 2:24:38.800]  Men have been, you know, the warrior ants of the culture.
[2:24:38.800 --> 2:24:43.800]  But everything they do is about women, especially the greater men.
[2:24:43.800 --> 2:24:48.800]  And so the greatest deception is that we're not together.
[2:24:48.800 --> 2:24:52.800]  And the better a civilization, the more it treats women with reverence.
[2:24:52.800 --> 2:24:58.800]  But you see the West now, I mean, I was there just six months ago, the day after the inauguration,
[2:24:58.800 --> 2:25:01.800]  where they were beating everybody up trying to go under here, Trump inaugurated.
[2:25:01.800 --> 2:25:05.800]  And then we're not beating them up and there are over a million women and they're putting on hijabs
[2:25:05.800 --> 2:25:08.800]  and saying we do this for Islam and Muslims were leading it.
[2:25:08.800 --> 2:25:13.800]  And I mean, Islam is like, it's like should be feminist, you know, enemy.
[2:25:13.800 --> 2:25:14.800]  But see, it's not about that.
[2:25:14.800 --> 2:25:18.800]  It's about authoritarianism and it's about bringing down the West.
[2:25:18.800 --> 2:25:30.800]  And so I think modern feminism is the most wounded now because they have bought into Islam.
[2:25:30.800 --> 2:25:36.800]  And so I want to go back to our guest and talk about this amazing film that Mike Cernovich is a producer on.
[2:25:36.800 --> 2:25:37.800]  That's what's so great about Mike.
[2:25:37.800 --> 2:25:38.800]  He's involved in so many great things.
[2:25:38.800 --> 2:25:39.800]  He's gonna be hosting the next hour.
[2:25:39.800 --> 2:25:41.800]  What about the juxtaposing?
[2:25:41.800 --> 2:25:43.800]  This is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[2:25:43.800 --> 2:25:57.800]  What about the juxtaposing of Islam and feminism, not every modern corporate feminism not saying anything?
[2:25:57.800 --> 2:26:03.800]  Well, this is obviously a touchy subject and it's something I don't include in the film.
[2:26:03.800 --> 2:26:08.800]  I don't know if I could ever make a film about this topic because I do think it'd be too dangerous.
[2:26:08.800 --> 2:26:18.800]  But part of why I dropped the feminist label after making the Red Pill movie is actually the main reason why I dropped the feminist label
[2:26:18.800 --> 2:26:22.800]  was because I started to see the hypocrisy within feminism.
[2:26:22.800 --> 2:26:28.800]  So it wasn't necessarily learning about men's issues from men's rights activists that made me leave feminism.
[2:26:28.800 --> 2:26:31.800]  And I'm not a men's rights activist just to clarify.
[2:26:31.800 --> 2:26:37.800]  But learning more about feminism and how they do want to silence discussion
[2:26:37.800 --> 2:26:42.800]  and they are not consistent with their view of protecting and empowering women.
[2:26:42.800 --> 2:26:48.800]  And I think their stance on Islam is part of that.
[2:26:48.800 --> 2:26:55.800]  Why is there, or unless you disagree, an obsession with pulling down the West in third-wave feminism
[2:26:55.800 --> 2:26:59.800]  when the West is what put women on a pedestal almost to a ridiculous level?
[2:26:59.800 --> 2:27:00.800]  I agree.
[2:27:00.800 --> 2:27:03.800]  The woman wants to be a tombore, the woman wants to be an executive.
[2:27:03.800 --> 2:27:07.800]  When women actually are drawn to those roles, it's genetic and they're the best at it.
[2:27:07.800 --> 2:27:11.800]  But in the main, women are nurturative and creative and make the nest.
[2:27:11.800 --> 2:27:13.800]  And this is just what we do as a species.
[2:27:13.800 --> 2:27:15.800]  But I've got three dollars.
[2:27:15.800 --> 2:27:17.800]  If they want to be CEO, president, God, I'm all behind it.
[2:27:17.800 --> 2:27:19.800]  I mean, I'm a guy that likes women, period.
[2:27:19.800 --> 2:27:21.800]  I like the company of women, period.
[2:27:21.800 --> 2:27:27.800]  This idea is an alpha male that I don't like women is the opposite.
[2:27:27.800 --> 2:27:35.800]  Well, my personal view is that the reason feminism has chosen to protect Islam
[2:27:35.800 --> 2:27:42.800]  and not criticize it or critique it in any way is I think it's a part of being a voting bloc
[2:27:42.800 --> 2:27:48.800]  because conservatives, especially in the U.S., have really stuff behind Christianity
[2:27:48.800 --> 2:27:51.800]  and that's their voting bloc.
[2:27:51.800 --> 2:27:57.800]  And so while Democrats have sided with feminists,
[2:27:57.800 --> 2:28:05.800]  I think they also saw a big market for immigrants and Muslims and LGBT.
[2:28:05.800 --> 2:28:10.800]  So it's a cold-blooded alliance.
[2:28:10.800 --> 2:28:12.800]  You could say it like that.
[2:28:12.800 --> 2:28:16.800]  Wow, where do you see this going then?
[2:28:16.800 --> 2:28:24.800]  Gosh, well, it doesn't look like a very positive future
[2:28:24.800 --> 2:28:26.800]  if we keep down this path that we're going down.
[2:28:26.800 --> 2:28:31.800]  But I do hope that the red pill at least shows a more nuanced conversation
[2:28:31.800 --> 2:28:38.800]  around feminism and men's issues and so that we can start to work together
[2:28:38.800 --> 2:28:42.800]  and point out the hypocrisies on either side.
[2:28:42.800 --> 2:28:49.800]  Also, something that I would like to mention is that the best result out of making the red pill movie
[2:28:49.800 --> 2:28:54.800]  was it positively influenced my relationship with my now-fiance.
[2:28:54.800 --> 2:28:59.800]  We've been together six years and so I was with him for two years before making the red pill movie
[2:28:59.800 --> 2:29:04.800]  and then he stuck with me the entire making of the red pill
[2:29:04.800 --> 2:29:10.800]  and our relationship has just gotten tenfold times better.
[2:29:10.800 --> 2:29:17.800]  The power of a man and woman combining forces and using each other's skills, it's the complete human.
[2:29:17.800 --> 2:29:20.800]  The humanity is the man and woman coming together.
[2:29:20.800 --> 2:29:22.800]  That's the magic. That's the power.
[2:29:22.800 --> 2:29:26.800]  And when that happens with those two forces together, it's the universe.
[2:29:26.800 --> 2:29:29.800]  It's the seed of the universe. It's life. It's God.
[2:29:29.800 --> 2:29:34.800]  That's what it is and that's why these globalists want to destroy that because they want full control
[2:29:34.800 --> 2:29:38.800]  and when they get men and women fighting with each other and men acting like lazy punks
[2:29:38.800 --> 2:29:43.800]  and women being a bunch of narcissistic loons, they're all so unhappy
[2:29:43.800 --> 2:29:47.800]  so they dig their graves deeper into the modern cultural poison
[2:29:47.800 --> 2:29:59.800]  believing that will deliver them from it when humanity was always there. Stay there.
[2:30:18.800 --> 2:30:26.800]  One thing is for sure, with how long it's taking NBC to edit making Kelly's interview with Alex Jones
[2:30:26.800 --> 2:30:33.800]  prior to just airing it, we can expect that they will be misrepresenting his statements with skilled editing techniques.
[2:30:33.800 --> 2:30:38.800]  Why not just release the entire interview unedited and prove you're not fake news, NBC?
[2:30:38.800 --> 2:30:44.800]  They'd like you to believe that Alex Jones, not Adam Lanza, is the real bad guy in the Sandy Hook Massacre
[2:30:44.800 --> 2:30:47.800]  because he said he believes there was a government conspiracy at work.
[2:30:47.800 --> 2:30:50.800]  However, all of this will backfire on the mainstream media
[2:30:50.800 --> 2:30:54.800]  as everyday Americans are increasingly becoming more aware of the staging,
[2:30:54.800 --> 2:30:57.800]  faking and lying that is the mainstream media.
[2:30:57.800 --> 2:31:26.800]  For more reports go to infowars.com.
[2:31:27.800 --> 2:31:32.800]  To the best job you can to purify your air, the elite are masters at poisoning our environment
[2:31:32.800 --> 2:31:37.800]  while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[2:31:37.800 --> 2:31:39.800]  The general public doesn't.
[2:31:39.800 --> 2:31:43.800]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[2:31:43.800 --> 2:31:47.800]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[2:31:47.800 --> 2:31:54.800]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[2:31:54.800 --> 2:31:59.800]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at infowarsstore.com.

[2:32:31.800 --> 2:32:34.800]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[2:32:34.800 --> 2:32:37.800]  It's loaded with good halogen iodide, some of the bad halogen fluoride.
[2:32:37.800 --> 2:32:44.800]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used at biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[2:32:44.800 --> 2:32:52.800]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue, chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodide, nano silver and more.

[2:33:12.800 --> 2:33:17.800]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:17.800 --> 2:33:23.800]  One of the executive producers, Mike Cernovich of the film, The Red Pill, with a great name.
[2:33:23.800 --> 2:33:27.800]  I'm thinking about launching, I am launching a bunch of new shows.
[2:33:27.800 --> 2:33:33.800]  We're going to call it like Reboot America, American Reboot, Red Pill, Adventures, Round Table shows.
[2:33:33.800 --> 2:33:35.800]  Bunch of things we've got in the hopper.
[2:33:35.800 --> 2:33:37.800]  Thanks for your support.
[2:33:37.800 --> 2:33:39.800]  But listen, we need your financial support.
[2:33:39.800 --> 2:33:44.800]  Quite frankly, I should buy 5,000 or 10,000 of this film and sell it at infowarsstore.com.
[2:33:44.800 --> 2:33:47.800]  We haven't done that. We should do that.
[2:33:47.800 --> 2:33:52.800]  That's one way to fund our operation is to actually sell the films and things we promote.
[2:33:52.800 --> 2:33:58.800]  But whatever you do, get the redpillmovie.com because it shows both sides of this
[2:33:58.800 --> 2:34:02.800]  and the perspective of what women have gone through and what men have gone through.
[2:34:02.800 --> 2:34:08.800]  But it's a human experience as our species goes through all these changes
[2:34:08.800 --> 2:34:13.800]  and all these things that are happening and then people are trying to artificially manipulate it for political control.
[2:34:13.800 --> 2:34:16.800]  It's a really important documentary.
[2:34:16.800 --> 2:34:18.800]  Really, really important.
[2:34:18.800 --> 2:34:21.800]  We have another film, The Good American, with William Benning.
[2:34:21.800 --> 2:34:23.800]  That's at infowarsstore.com, everybody should get.
[2:34:23.800 --> 2:34:26.800]  But the redpill is something everybody needs in their library.
[2:34:26.800 --> 2:34:32.800]  You should get it, watch it, donate it to your local library so that people can see it.
[2:34:32.800 --> 2:34:34.800]  Because it's not dogmatic.
[2:34:34.800 --> 2:34:37.800]  It's just somebody's experience, common sense, looking at both sides.
[2:34:37.800 --> 2:34:39.800]  It brings us together.
[2:34:39.800 --> 2:34:44.800]  That's why the social engineers masquerading as leftists are trying to shut it down.
[2:34:44.800 --> 2:34:49.800]  But IMDb gives it an unprecedented 3,470 votes and 8.8.
[2:34:49.800 --> 2:34:52.800]  You never, I mean Stanley Kubrick films barely get that.
[2:34:52.800 --> 2:34:55.800]  So my films get like sevens and stuff, which is pretty good.
[2:34:55.800 --> 2:34:57.800]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:34:57.800 --> 2:35:04.800]  The redpill, as Alice falls down the rabbit hole to see what the old men are doing.
[2:35:04.800 --> 2:35:08.800]  Very criminal social engineers are up to, it's sick, so that's there.
[2:35:08.800 --> 2:35:13.800]  Please also understand that we sell water filtration, non-GMO heirloom seeds,
[2:35:13.800 --> 2:35:20.800]  shirts, you know, Patriot apparel, high quality supplements, freeze dryers from Harvest Right discounted.
[2:35:20.800 --> 2:35:26.800]  When you buy products at infowarsstore.com, you're financing a global revolution
[2:35:26.800 --> 2:35:28.800]  against the technocrats and against the humanization.
[2:35:28.800 --> 2:35:30.800]  And you see why they're attacking us.
[2:35:30.800 --> 2:35:34.800]  I mean, you get high quality shampoo that's a brand name in Whole Foods for 20% off.
[2:35:34.800 --> 2:35:37.800]  Sign up for auto, ship additional 25% off, that's 45% off.
[2:35:37.800 --> 2:35:39.800]  That's going to end next week, by the way.
[2:35:39.800 --> 2:35:41.800]  I got to stop doing that because it makes no money, basically.
[2:35:41.800 --> 2:35:43.800]  We've got the organic deodorant.
[2:35:43.800 --> 2:35:44.800]  We've got it all there.
[2:35:44.800 --> 2:35:51.800]  We've got the fluoride-free toothpaste, super blue, with the colloidal silver and iodine, infowarsstore.com.
[2:35:51.800 --> 2:35:56.800]  And we've got super male vitality and super female vitality, which is basically the same formula.
[2:35:56.800 --> 2:35:59.800]  There's just a little bit of one other herb in the female.
[2:35:59.800 --> 2:36:02.800]  And the people want to have male and female, that's fine.
[2:36:02.800 --> 2:36:04.800]  It's the truth, those were so close, it's the same thing almost.
[2:36:04.800 --> 2:36:09.800]  That's just concentrated herbs into an oil form, libido, stamina, energy.
[2:36:09.800 --> 2:36:10.800]  You name it.
[2:36:10.800 --> 2:36:13.800]  I'm not going to get into the technicals, what these well-known herbs do.
[2:36:13.800 --> 2:36:16.800]  Just try it out for yourself, infowarsstore.com.
[2:36:16.800 --> 2:36:20.800]  We've got the studies out there, of course, on what not having enough selenium does.
[2:36:20.800 --> 2:36:24.800]  We have the Biotru from the mustard seed, totally pure, totally organic.
[2:36:24.800 --> 2:36:26.800]  That's 25% off with the X2.
[2:36:26.800 --> 2:36:27.800]  That's the good halogen.
[2:36:27.800 --> 2:36:28.800]  Look at what's happening to women.
[2:36:28.800 --> 2:36:32.800]  If women don't have iodine, particularly, it really jacks them up.
[2:36:32.800 --> 2:36:38.800]  So again, infowarslife.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[2:36:38.800 --> 2:36:43.800]  And you see the full assault taking place against info wars.
[2:36:43.800 --> 2:36:45.800]  And that's because we're changing the world.
[2:36:45.800 --> 2:36:49.800]  We're returning Americana, which is the vanguard of Renaissance.
[2:36:49.800 --> 2:36:50.800]  It's not some old system.
[2:36:50.800 --> 2:36:52.800]  It's the reboot of humanity.
[2:36:52.800 --> 2:36:56.800]  We're just bringing back plagiarizing 1776 with pleasure.
[2:36:56.800 --> 2:36:59.800]  So again, we need your support, want to thank you all for your support.
[2:36:59.800 --> 2:37:04.800]  And today go to infowarsstore.com, but regardless, spread the article, spread the video, spread
[2:37:04.800 --> 2:37:06.800]  the video of the behind the scenes with Megan Kelly.
[2:37:06.800 --> 2:37:08.800]  More is coming over the weekend.
[2:37:08.800 --> 2:37:14.800]  I think I'm going to release, I think I'm going to release the interview she did with
[2:37:14.800 --> 2:37:18.800]  me beforehand, because then after they'll just play it and kind of ignore what she
[2:37:18.800 --> 2:37:19.800]  really said, what she really did.
[2:37:19.800 --> 2:37:20.800]  Now she edited it.
[2:37:20.800 --> 2:37:22.800]  I think, I think I might do that, but we'll see.
[2:37:22.800 --> 2:37:23.800]  There'll be some live feeds this weekend.
[2:37:23.800 --> 2:37:27.800]  We're going to be breaking all down ahead of what is one of the top stories and not the
[2:37:27.800 --> 2:37:29.800]  top stories in the country.
[2:37:29.800 --> 2:37:35.800]  But going back to the director and the lady that is in the middle of this, of the film,
[2:37:35.800 --> 2:37:42.800]  the redpillmovie.com, Red Pill, let's, let's Cassie go through your experience, go through,
[2:37:42.800 --> 2:37:44.800]  because you know, the classic thing is I'm excited.
[2:37:44.800 --> 2:37:45.800]  I'm jumping in.
[2:37:45.800 --> 2:37:47.800]  Don't worry, I interrupt many, but more than women.
[2:37:47.800 --> 2:37:50.800]  I'm like a wild, wild animal, but spend 10 minutes.
[2:37:50.800 --> 2:37:51.800]  You've got the floor.
[2:37:51.800 --> 2:37:55.800]  Give us a speech about your process, your life, the world, where you see it going.
[2:37:55.800 --> 2:37:56.800]  Oh my goodness.
[2:37:56.800 --> 2:38:02.800]  Okay, so not only did making the redpill lead me down a path where I no longer call myself
[2:38:02.800 --> 2:38:07.800]  a feminist, but now I really do see through the mainstream media's tactics.
[2:38:07.800 --> 2:38:15.800]  And the process of releasing the redpill film really opened my eyes to how manipulated the
[2:38:15.800 --> 2:38:19.800]  people are being from the mainstream media.
[2:38:19.800 --> 2:38:24.800]  And Men's Rights Activists told me while I was making the film that you, if you make
[2:38:24.800 --> 2:38:27.800]  a feminist film, people will hate you for it.
[2:38:27.800 --> 2:38:28.800]  Feminists will hate you for it.
[2:38:28.800 --> 2:38:34.800]  The mainstream media won't give you, you know, any kind of favorable coverage of this film.
[2:38:34.800 --> 2:38:36.800]  And they were right.
[2:38:36.800 --> 2:38:40.800]  And so, you know, I made the truth of my journey, and that is the redpill film.
[2:38:40.800 --> 2:38:43.800]  And then I released it in theaters in October.
[2:38:43.800 --> 2:38:49.800]  The first article, mainstream article to come out was The Village Voice.
[2:38:49.800 --> 2:38:53.800]  And Alan Scherzel, the writer of that review, it was more of a rant.
[2:38:53.800 --> 2:38:57.800]  I don't want to give you the view of the film, but he set the stage on what the mainstream
[2:38:57.800 --> 2:38:59.800]  opinion about this film should be.
[2:38:59.800 --> 2:39:05.800]  And he included tons of misinformation and blatant fabricated lies about the film, saying
[2:39:05.800 --> 2:39:08.800]  that it was funded by MRAs, which it wasn't.
[2:39:08.800 --> 2:39:12.800]  It was funded actually by three self-identifying feminists at the time, myself, my fiance,
[2:39:12.800 --> 2:39:13.800]  and my mother.
[2:39:13.800 --> 2:39:14.800]  My mother's my producer.
[2:39:14.800 --> 2:39:16.800]  My fiance is the director of photography.
[2:39:16.800 --> 2:39:22.800]  And, you know, they're trying to smear my name and the film's credibility, hoping that
[2:39:22.800 --> 2:39:26.800]  people won't watch it or think it's propaganda of some sort.
[2:39:26.800 --> 2:39:27.800]  And it's not.
[2:39:27.800 --> 2:39:30.800]  It simply listens to men's rights activists and to feminists.
[2:39:30.800 --> 2:39:34.800]  And here's their different perspectives on gender and the audience is allowed to make
[2:39:34.800 --> 2:39:38.800]  their own opinion and find some middle ground of any sort.
[2:39:38.800 --> 2:39:42.800]  It's not promoting any kind of movement or side.
[2:39:42.800 --> 2:39:47.800]  And so The Village Voice kind of set the stage on what the mainstream will think of this
[2:39:47.800 --> 2:39:49.800]  film or how they'll write it off.
[2:39:49.800 --> 2:39:56.300]  But after that, the American media, I think, has put a gag order on this film because they
[2:39:56.300 --> 2:40:02.800]  haven't released any more kind of mainstream coverage of the Red Pill movie since October.
[2:40:02.800 --> 2:40:04.800]  And that's really your Congressional Medal of Honor right there.
[2:40:04.800 --> 2:40:09.800]  That's the certification when they put those blackout stories there.
[2:40:09.800 --> 2:40:10.800]  Yes.
[2:40:10.800 --> 2:40:16.800]  But we've had a lot of success in discussions in other countries around this film.
[2:40:16.800 --> 2:40:20.800]  So the other territories that really know about this film and are talking about it are
[2:40:20.800 --> 2:40:22.800]  Canada, the UK, and Australia.
[2:40:22.800 --> 2:40:28.800]  And Australia, in particular, I'm going to focus on because they've engaged in the most
[2:40:28.800 --> 2:40:34.800]  censorship around the Red Pill film where we had sold out screenings at this theater
[2:40:34.800 --> 2:40:39.800]  chain called Dendy Cinemas, which is part owned by Mel Gibson.
[2:40:39.800 --> 2:40:47.800]  And we had sold out screenings there and feminists created petitions to tell Dendy that if you
[2:40:47.800 --> 2:40:53.800]  screen this film, we're going to pull all of our kind of, you know, being a customer
[2:40:53.800 --> 2:40:55.800]  at your theater so you need to pull the film.
[2:40:55.800 --> 2:41:00.800]  And so Dendy was, you know, threatened into submission and they pulled the two screenings
[2:41:00.800 --> 2:41:01.800]  there.
[2:41:01.800 --> 2:41:06.800]  Also, Palace Cinemas was under attack for screening, having a planned screening of the film.
[2:41:06.800 --> 2:41:09.800]  This is so authoritarian.
[2:41:09.800 --> 2:41:13.800]  And again, I mean, your film is so well done, so balanced, the crime is you bring people
[2:41:13.800 --> 2:41:16.800]  together.
[2:41:16.800 --> 2:41:19.800]  And it's really not, it's not propaganda for any side.
[2:41:19.800 --> 2:41:20.800]  You know, I'm very...
[2:41:20.800 --> 2:41:21.800]  But it doesn't matter.
[2:41:21.800 --> 2:41:23.800]  You have a right to put it in theaters.
[2:41:23.800 --> 2:41:25.800]  People have a right to go see it.
[2:41:25.800 --> 2:41:26.800]  Yes.
[2:41:26.800 --> 2:41:27.800]  Yes.
[2:41:27.800 --> 2:41:32.800]  And I clearly see there's one side that is engaging in more silencing and censorship
[2:41:32.800 --> 2:41:33.800]  than any others.
[2:41:33.800 --> 2:41:39.800]  And that is the extreme regressive left with feminists included and extremist feminists,
[2:41:39.800 --> 2:41:40.800]  radical feminists.
[2:41:40.800 --> 2:41:45.800]  I don't think all feminists are like that, but the radical ones are the loudest and
[2:41:45.800 --> 2:41:49.800]  are going and creating these petitions and getting films removed from theaters.
[2:41:49.800 --> 2:41:55.880]  And I haven't heard of any other films in recent history that have had this many screenings
[2:41:55.880 --> 2:41:56.880]  pulled from theaters.
[2:41:56.880 --> 2:41:59.800]  Well, they're scared of it because you and your fiance did such a great job and your
[2:41:59.800 --> 2:42:01.800]  mom funding it, expanding on this.
[2:42:01.800 --> 2:42:03.800]  I just want to make the statement.
[2:42:03.800 --> 2:42:04.800]  Have you continue?
[2:42:04.800 --> 2:42:06.800]  I want to get this out here.
[2:42:06.800 --> 2:42:13.800]  The journey of humanity together as a species is all of our shared ancestry.
[2:42:13.800 --> 2:42:19.800]  We are one species and the fact that they try to block and censor somebody like you that
[2:42:19.800 --> 2:42:23.800]  is just pointing that out is sickening.
[2:42:23.800 --> 2:42:28.800]  But this is why people are so upset as we blame men or women because there are a lot
[2:42:28.800 --> 2:42:30.800]  of men that blame women for everything.
[2:42:30.800 --> 2:42:32.800]  It's like a cult and I'm sick of it as well.
[2:42:32.800 --> 2:42:33.800]  I mean, let's admit it.
[2:42:33.800 --> 2:42:35.800]  We've been fighting with each other for a long time.
[2:42:35.800 --> 2:42:36.800]  It's stupid.
[2:42:36.800 --> 2:42:37.800]  It's like cancer.
[2:42:37.800 --> 2:42:39.800]  Humanity is going through a crisis.
[2:42:39.800 --> 2:42:42.800]  Cancer rates in children are up 10,000%.
[2:42:42.800 --> 2:42:44.800]  Diabetes type 2 is up 3,000%.
[2:42:44.800 --> 2:42:49.800]  All these issues, we're in crisis together and instead of panicking and blaming each other,
[2:42:49.800 --> 2:42:51.800]  we need to really talk about it.
[2:42:51.800 --> 2:42:58.800]  And again, I say this, your crime is you lovingly bring people together and unify us as humans
[2:42:58.800 --> 2:42:59.800]  to fix it.
[2:42:59.800 --> 2:43:02.800]  And there are people that want to exacerbate the problems.
[2:43:02.800 --> 2:43:03.800]  They don't want to fix it.
[2:43:03.800 --> 2:43:05.800]  They want crisis management.
[2:43:05.800 --> 2:43:06.800]  That's how they control people.
[2:43:06.800 --> 2:43:08.800]  But we're in a crisis.
[2:43:08.800 --> 2:43:09.800]  Let's recognize that.
[2:43:09.800 --> 2:43:15.800]  And the answer is celebrating women, celebrating men, celebrating families and then loving anybody
[2:43:15.800 --> 2:43:18.800]  else that wants to slander something else.
[2:43:18.800 --> 2:43:19.800]  That's part of creativity.
[2:43:19.800 --> 2:43:24.800]  But when it gets too extreme, it becomes a cancer that kills the original core of what
[2:43:24.800 --> 2:43:30.800]  we are as humanity goes through these changes.
[2:43:30.800 --> 2:43:32.800]  I completely agree.
[2:43:32.800 --> 2:43:37.800]  And I think it's really scary because they are trying to make an example of me that if
[2:43:37.800 --> 2:43:42.800]  you go off script and if you challenge status quo in the way that I did with the red pill,
[2:43:42.800 --> 2:43:43.800]  you will be silenced.
[2:43:43.800 --> 2:43:44.800]  You will be smeared.
[2:43:44.800 --> 2:43:45.800]  Let me guess.
[2:43:45.800 --> 2:43:46.800]  Let me guess.
[2:43:46.800 --> 2:43:48.800]  I bet you're selling more DVDs than ever.
[2:43:48.800 --> 2:43:52.800]  Well, that's the strange thing because even though apparently we have this gag order
[2:43:52.800 --> 2:43:58.800]  in the US in May, we were the top selling movie on YouTube ahead of Guardians of the Galaxy,
[2:43:58.800 --> 2:44:01.800]  Moana and Rogue One, the Star Wars film.
[2:44:01.800 --> 2:44:08.800]  I mean, we had just, you haven't seen this kind of success in sales from a documentary
[2:44:08.800 --> 2:44:11.800]  in a long time and yet the mainstream media won't touch it.
[2:44:11.800 --> 2:44:15.800]  Well, I've been talking to folks, highest levels of the government, highest levels of
[2:44:15.800 --> 2:44:17.800]  banking, they won out of this new world order.
[2:44:17.800 --> 2:44:18.800]  And that's what they said.
[2:44:18.800 --> 2:44:21.800]  They said they recognize it's an illusion.
[2:44:21.800 --> 2:44:23.800]  This bullying is all an illusion.
[2:44:23.800 --> 2:44:26.800]  Nobody launched a boycott of Starbucks when they said they were going to hire a bunch
[2:44:26.800 --> 2:44:28.800]  of Islamic refugees.
[2:44:28.800 --> 2:44:32.800]  Everyone just spontaneously did it in a tipping point.
[2:44:32.800 --> 2:44:37.800]  So I mean, I knew your film was a hit, but I didn't know almost outdoing Rogue One,
[2:44:37.800 --> 2:44:39.800]  which by the way is a great film.
[2:44:39.800 --> 2:44:40.800]  I love seeing a powerful woman in that role.
[2:44:40.800 --> 2:44:43.800]  It's a great movie, but it's about men and women together in victory.
[2:44:43.800 --> 2:44:47.800]  And even I see Hollywood starting to now get away from this total feminist narrative.
[2:44:47.800 --> 2:44:49.800]  I love seeing Wonder Woman.
[2:44:49.800 --> 2:44:50.800]  I love seeing women in power.
[2:44:50.800 --> 2:44:52.800]  Just don't make it the expense of men.
[2:44:52.800 --> 2:44:54.800]  Yeah, I agree.
[2:44:54.800 --> 2:45:01.800]  And currently this week we are the top selling film in Australia on YouTube as well as Google
[2:45:01.800 --> 2:45:02.800]  Play for documentaries.
[2:45:02.800 --> 2:45:06.800]  I was just in Australia for about two weeks doing a screening, a press tour there.
[2:45:06.800 --> 2:45:13.800]  And they have a big hill to climb over there regarding gender politics.
[2:45:13.800 --> 2:45:15.800]  Why don't they get the Streisand effect?
[2:45:15.800 --> 2:45:17.800]  I mean, you know about the Streisand effect.
[2:45:17.800 --> 2:45:21.800]  Oh, yes, it's worked very well in my favor.
[2:45:21.800 --> 2:45:23.800]  I mean, just look at where I'm at.
[2:45:23.800 --> 2:45:27.800]  And now the articles are, oh, I'm bashing Megan Kelly because she's a woman.
[2:45:27.800 --> 2:45:29.800]  No, nobody in media ever lied to me.
[2:45:29.800 --> 2:45:31.800]  They sent the night like her.
[2:45:31.800 --> 2:45:33.800]  The nightline guy said, I'm doing a hard interview.
[2:45:33.800 --> 2:45:34.800]  I'm coming after you.
[2:45:34.800 --> 2:45:39.800]  And he did hit me on some real points, but it's a real, he's a real journalist with her.
[2:45:39.800 --> 2:45:40.800]  It was just all lies.
[2:45:40.800 --> 2:45:41.800]  It's not that she's a woman.
[2:45:41.800 --> 2:45:44.800]  She's a liar.
[2:45:44.800 --> 2:45:50.800]  Well, I am looking forward to seeing her edit as well as your unedited interview.
[2:45:50.800 --> 2:45:54.800]  Well, ours is just the audio, but I mean, it was just like, I mean, I knew I was in,
[2:45:54.800 --> 2:45:57.800]  that she was lying when I was like, I believe Sandy Hook happened.
[2:45:57.800 --> 2:46:01.800]  And then like two minutes later, why are you saying the parents lied about their dead kids?
[2:46:01.800 --> 2:46:03.800]  And I went, Megan, I just told you my answer.
[2:46:03.800 --> 2:46:06.800]  No, you're saying gays deserve to be killed.
[2:46:06.800 --> 2:46:10.800]  I mean, it was just like, I was just like, whoa, I was like, I don't know what she's going to put out,
[2:46:10.800 --> 2:46:12.800]  but it was like, whoa.
[2:46:12.800 --> 2:46:14.800]  You know, that's why I love new media.
[2:46:14.800 --> 2:46:15.800]  Like your show.
[2:46:15.800 --> 2:46:18.800]  I was also on Dave Rubin and Stefan Molyneux and Steven Crowder,
[2:46:18.800 --> 2:46:24.800]  because you do live stream live interviews and edited interviews on mainstream media.
[2:46:24.800 --> 2:46:25.800]  That's what you have to watch out for.
[2:46:25.800 --> 2:46:30.800]  And that's how I was smeared and slandered in Australia was on this show called the project.
[2:46:30.800 --> 2:46:36.800]  I had a over a 15 minute interview and they edited it down to five minutes and completely,
[2:46:36.800 --> 2:46:40.800]  you know, took out all of my responses to the lies about the film.
[2:46:40.800 --> 2:46:45.800]  And in their edited intro of my film, they include these lies about the film about how it was funded
[2:46:45.800 --> 2:46:46.800]  or how many people I interviewed.
[2:46:46.800 --> 2:46:47.800]  Well, here's one of their favorite tactics.
[2:46:47.800 --> 2:46:49.800]  They get you in a house with this 90 degrees, you're sweating.
[2:46:49.800 --> 2:46:52.800]  Megan's back there, light on her perfect light under me.
[2:46:52.800 --> 2:46:54.800]  And then they go, let's take a break.
[2:46:54.800 --> 2:47:01.800]  And then I see them focusing the camera while I'm mopping my brow to make it look like I'm nervous
[2:47:01.800 --> 2:47:02.800]  and got up from the interview.
[2:47:02.800 --> 2:47:06.800]  I'm expecting that they're going to claim I got up from the interview because I saw them like thumbs
[2:47:06.800 --> 2:47:10.800]  uping when I went to the bathroom and like was mopping my head and they were like focusing
[2:47:10.800 --> 2:47:12.800]  and I just knew what they were going to do.
[2:47:12.800 --> 2:47:14.800]  I mean, it's so ridiculous.
[2:47:14.800 --> 2:47:16.800]  See, you know, and I'm an editor.
[2:47:16.800 --> 2:47:22.800]  I edited the full red pill film and that's so upsetting to hear how editors and mainstream
[2:47:22.800 --> 2:47:26.800]  shows use editing to manipulate the public.
[2:47:26.800 --> 2:47:32.800]  It's very easy to do and, you know, it comes down to the ethics and journalism.
[2:47:32.800 --> 2:47:34.800]  We don't do that because I'm not going to sink to their level.
[2:47:34.800 --> 2:47:38.800]  I mean, whenever we have people on the disagreement that make a good point, I show it
[2:47:38.800 --> 2:47:39.800]  because that's who we are.
[2:47:39.800 --> 2:47:40.800]  It's not like we're even perfect.
[2:47:40.800 --> 2:47:44.800]  I couldn't get in the mindset of like deceiving people.
[2:47:44.800 --> 2:47:45.800]  Yeah.
[2:47:45.800 --> 2:47:47.800]  But that's what's great about the discipline of being live.
[2:47:47.800 --> 2:47:51.800]  Like you just said, being live three, four hours a day, five hours a day, it's like a discipline.
[2:47:51.800 --> 2:47:53.800]  Your brain works quicker.
[2:47:53.800 --> 2:47:56.800]  You know, you just get this instinct to tell the truth.
[2:47:56.800 --> 2:47:57.800]  Yeah.
[2:47:57.800 --> 2:48:03.800]  And, you know, people who do tell the truth don't need to rely on editing because everything
[2:48:03.800 --> 2:48:08.800]  you say, you know, as long as you tap into your own truth and memory of how things happen,
[2:48:08.800 --> 2:48:12.800]  how events happen, then you don't have to, you know, oh, well, that's not correct.
[2:48:12.800 --> 2:48:13.800]  That came off wrong.
[2:48:13.800 --> 2:48:14.800]  You don't have to edit it out.
[2:48:14.800 --> 2:48:16.800]  Well, that's the thing is I'm not arrogant.
[2:48:16.800 --> 2:48:19.800]  I'm the opposite because I've been so blessed in my life and at the time I came to listen
[2:48:19.800 --> 2:48:20.800]  to my own show.
[2:48:20.800 --> 2:48:21.800]  I'm just being honest about like Nico.
[2:48:21.800 --> 2:48:22.800]  I hired Nico immediately.
[2:48:22.800 --> 2:48:25.800]  He's got a great record as a head producer, but also he said, I think your voice is kind
[2:48:25.800 --> 2:48:28.800]  of annoying and I disagree with a lot of what you say, but I think overall the message,
[2:48:28.800 --> 2:48:29.800]  I was like, well, you're hired.
[2:48:29.800 --> 2:48:30.800]  I'm sick of yes, man.
[2:48:30.800 --> 2:48:31.800]  He's been the best producer we ever had.
[2:48:31.800 --> 2:48:32.800]  But, but it's true.
[2:48:32.800 --> 2:48:35.800]  I mean, I see myself as annoying, but the heart is there.
[2:48:35.800 --> 2:48:41.800]  And the fact that the fact that, you know, I go into this stuff with like a child's heart
[2:48:41.800 --> 2:48:43.800]  about things and don't try to calculate.
[2:48:43.800 --> 2:48:47.800]  They now have the CIA and everybody else thinking I'm like the master calculator.
[2:48:47.800 --> 2:48:50.800]  It's all over the news, but it's not that it's, it's approaching life.
[2:48:50.800 --> 2:48:55.800]  Like just a normal person with your, like the greatest thing from ever said was, you
[2:48:55.800 --> 2:48:58.800]  know, I used to think about things to be too complex, but as soon as I became shallow and
[2:48:58.800 --> 2:49:01.800]  what was my instinct, it was the greatest moment in my life because it was so complex.
[2:49:01.800 --> 2:49:02.800]  They said, that doesn't make sense.
[2:49:02.800 --> 2:49:03.800]  No, it's true.
[2:49:03.800 --> 2:49:04.800]  We're so powerful.
[2:49:04.800 --> 2:49:10.800]  Our first gut approximation with a database of knowledge is generally way better than
[2:49:10.800 --> 2:49:13.800]  trying to overthink stuff is what I'm saying.
[2:49:13.800 --> 2:49:14.800]  Yeah.
[2:49:14.800 --> 2:49:16.800]  It's like woman's intuition.
[2:49:16.800 --> 2:49:17.800]  Yeah.
[2:49:17.800 --> 2:49:22.800]  About women that pick the men that build the civilization together without women's intuition
[2:49:22.800 --> 2:49:23.800]  were destroyed.
[2:49:23.800 --> 2:49:27.800]  So why is 80% of marketing targeting women because women are already king.
[2:49:27.800 --> 2:49:28.800]  Yeah.
[2:49:28.800 --> 2:49:31.800]  Of course your film lays that out.
[2:49:31.800 --> 2:49:33.800]  That's why they hate it.
[2:49:33.800 --> 2:49:34.800]  Yeah.
[2:49:34.800 --> 2:49:35.800]  I guess so.
[2:49:35.800 --> 2:49:39.800]  I, you know, feminism really does have just the blinders on tunnel vision that they only
[2:49:39.800 --> 2:49:43.800]  want to look at how women are disadvantaged and men are privileged, but there is the flip
[2:49:43.800 --> 2:49:44.800]  side as well.
[2:49:44.800 --> 2:49:46.800]  And I think we need to look at that.
[2:49:46.800 --> 2:49:50.800]  Men are privileged to die six years earlier on average.
[2:49:50.800 --> 2:49:54.800]  Men are, like you said, 90% of the workplace deaths men.
[2:49:54.800 --> 2:49:57.800]  It's expected of men to expend themselves.
[2:49:57.800 --> 2:49:59.800]  Men are expendable.
[2:49:59.800 --> 2:50:05.800]  And, you know, so in the red pill, we do talk about male disposability, including war deaths,
[2:50:05.800 --> 2:50:08.800]  workplace deaths, suicide rates across the world.
[2:50:08.800 --> 2:50:13.800]  That's about 80% of all suicides are men every country.
[2:50:13.800 --> 2:50:16.800]  And shorter life expectancy, all these things.
[2:50:16.800 --> 2:50:21.800]  But what the men's rights activists are saying, they're not trying to say, you know, 50% of
[2:50:21.800 --> 2:50:23.800]  women should die in military deaths.
[2:50:23.800 --> 2:50:24.800]  They're not trying to say that.
[2:50:24.800 --> 2:50:28.800]  But what they are saying is that we need to look at the big picture regarding gender.
[2:50:28.800 --> 2:50:32.800]  Both genders make sacrifices, especially when it's a family unit.
[2:50:32.800 --> 2:50:36.800]  Obviously a stay-at-home mom is going to make a lot of sacrifices as well.
[2:50:36.800 --> 2:50:40.800]  Yeah, as well as the father who's going outside the home to provide for the family.
[2:50:40.800 --> 2:50:41.800]  To work on electrical lines.
[2:50:41.800 --> 2:50:42.800]  And again, we're one species.
[2:50:42.800 --> 2:50:44.800]  It's so obvious, but no one says it.
[2:50:44.800 --> 2:50:46.800]  We are the species.
[2:50:46.800 --> 2:50:49.800]  Again, we don't look at like dogs and say, that's male, that's female.
[2:50:49.800 --> 2:50:50.800]  They're fighting with each other.
[2:50:50.800 --> 2:50:51.800]  It's the species.
[2:50:51.800 --> 2:50:52.800]  It's what we developed into.
[2:50:52.800 --> 2:50:54.800]  We'll be back with our amazing guest.

[2:52:37.800 --> 2:52:38.800]  The deodorant.
[2:52:38.800 --> 2:52:39.800]  The mouthwash.

[2:52:43.800 --> 2:52:44.800]  Just the name is different.

[2:53:55.800 --> 2:54:06.800]  And today at TrumpSilverStatue.com.
[2:54:06.800 --> 2:54:07.800]  Alright, final segment.
[2:54:07.800 --> 2:54:10.800]  Cassie J. The Mike Cernovich is coming up.
[2:54:10.800 --> 2:54:11.800]  Cassie J. TheRedPillMovie.com.
[2:54:11.800 --> 2:54:13.800]  Get it on Amazon wherever.
[2:54:13.800 --> 2:54:14.800]  But don't go to Amazon.
[2:54:14.800 --> 2:54:16.800]  Bezos is funding the globalist.
[2:54:16.800 --> 2:54:19.800]  $600 million to bring down Trump from the CIA.
[2:54:19.800 --> 2:54:21.800]  Go get it from RedPillMovie.com.
[2:54:21.800 --> 2:54:23.800]  That way it might cost a dollar more or whatever.
[2:54:23.800 --> 2:54:25.800]  Because Amazon undercuts everybody.
[2:54:25.800 --> 2:54:27.800]  I mean, they're bigger than Walmart now.
[2:54:27.800 --> 2:54:28.800]  They're more cancerous.
[2:54:28.800 --> 2:54:29.800]  I mean, it's so evil.
[2:54:29.800 --> 2:54:30.800]  It's eating Walmart.
[2:54:30.800 --> 2:54:32.800]  So, more and more, I'm just going to,
[2:54:32.800 --> 2:54:34.800]  I think I'm going to stop selling stuff on Amazon.
[2:54:34.800 --> 2:54:35.800]  I mean, because it's time to boycott.
[2:54:35.800 --> 2:54:37.800]  It's time to support folks who are promoting free speech.
[2:54:37.800 --> 2:54:38.800]  Get the film today.
[2:54:38.800 --> 2:54:39.800]  I'm going to call Cernovich or whoever I call.
[2:54:39.800 --> 2:54:41.800]  I'm going to award 10,000 of this film.
[2:54:41.800 --> 2:54:42.800]  This is the film I want to promote.
[2:54:42.800 --> 2:54:44.800]  I want to push this film.
[2:54:44.800 --> 2:54:47.800]  I want to thank Anthony Gutiarty and others for recommending me
[2:54:47.800 --> 2:54:49.800]  to see the film a few weeks ago.
[2:54:49.800 --> 2:54:50.800]  And then I'd forgotten about it.
[2:54:50.800 --> 2:54:51.800]  And then so much goes on.
[2:54:51.800 --> 2:54:53.800]  And then Nico's like, hey, she's on the show.
[2:54:53.800 --> 2:54:55.800]  So Cassie Jay, the last minute or two,
[2:54:55.800 --> 2:54:58.800]  other points you'd like to impart to folks.
[2:54:58.800 --> 2:55:00.800]  Oh, well, as you're talking about platforms,
[2:55:00.800 --> 2:55:04.800]  the only platform to decline the Red Pill movie is Netflix,
[2:55:04.800 --> 2:55:06.800]  which I think is very interesting.
[2:55:06.800 --> 2:55:08.800]  But you can find us on all other platforms,
[2:55:08.800 --> 2:55:11.800]  including Hulu, iTunes, YouTube, Google Play, Voodoo,
[2:55:11.800 --> 2:55:13.800]  Apple TV, everywhere.
[2:55:13.800 --> 2:55:17.800]  So, yeah, Netflix did decline the film.
[2:55:17.800 --> 2:55:19.800]  And notice they force-fed Amy Schumer
[2:55:19.800 --> 2:55:21.800]  that got half a star.
[2:55:21.800 --> 2:55:23.800]  So they got rid of the star system on things
[2:55:23.800 --> 2:55:24.800]  they know people are sick of.
[2:55:24.800 --> 2:55:27.800]  I mean, Amy Schumer, they're trying to make the new sex symbol
[2:55:27.800 --> 2:55:30.800]  who's anti-male, anti-female.
[2:55:30.800 --> 2:55:34.800]  Yeah, you know, that's part of the hypocrisy
[2:55:34.800 --> 2:55:37.800]  I see in feminism is that if they were truly about supporting
[2:55:37.800 --> 2:55:40.800]  women, then why have they worked so hard
[2:55:40.800 --> 2:55:42.800]  to silence me in my film?
[2:55:42.800 --> 2:55:45.800]  I actually won a Women in Film Award for the Red Pill movie
[2:55:45.800 --> 2:55:47.800]  in Hollywood a couple weeks ago.
[2:55:47.800 --> 2:55:50.800]  Mike Cernovich was there with me to accept the award.
[2:55:50.800 --> 2:55:53.800]  And so I know that there are women out there
[2:55:53.800 --> 2:55:58.800]  and feminist women who do see the film as being valuable
[2:55:58.800 --> 2:56:00.800]  to the discussion of gender equality.
[2:56:00.800 --> 2:56:03.800]  But, you know, the radical ones and the extremists
[2:56:03.800 --> 2:56:05.800]  are trying to silence it.
[2:56:05.800 --> 2:56:06.800]  Well, I got three daughters,
[2:56:06.800 --> 2:56:08.800]  and I want total gender equality.
[2:56:08.800 --> 2:56:10.800]  And just God bless you for what you're doing.
[2:56:10.800 --> 2:56:12.800]  Congratulations on the film and your success
[2:56:12.800 --> 2:56:13.800]  as women upstream.
[2:56:13.800 --> 2:56:15.800]  Thank you so much.
[2:56:15.800 --> 2:56:17.800]  Beautiful, true portrayal blazer.
[2:56:17.800 --> 2:56:19.800]  They fear women so much when women realize
[2:56:19.800 --> 2:56:20.800]  they're running the show.
[2:56:20.800 --> 2:56:21.800]  That's not patronizing, it's true.
[2:56:21.800 --> 2:56:24.800]  When they get behind men and men get behind them
[2:56:24.800 --> 2:56:26.800]  and you're on a team, you realize the globalist,
[2:56:26.800 --> 2:56:28.800]  these artificial systems like Islam
[2:56:28.800 --> 2:56:29.800]  are trying to enslave that.
[2:56:29.800 --> 2:56:31.800]  When you do that, it is unstoppable.
[2:56:31.800 --> 2:56:34.800]  And so many other people who are talk show hosts
[2:56:34.800 --> 2:56:36.800]  can't launch other networks because, you know,
[2:56:36.800 --> 2:56:38.800]  there's a talented Mike Cernovich, you know, other,
[2:56:38.800 --> 2:56:40.800]  I mean, to be honest, a lot of men are just hyper-aggressive.
[2:56:40.800 --> 2:56:42.800]  They don't get, we're all in this together.
[2:56:42.800 --> 2:56:45.800]  I hope Mike Cernovich becomes more successful than I am.
[2:56:45.800 --> 2:56:47.800]  He already, in the aggregate, just in the time
[2:56:47.800 --> 2:56:50.800]  he's been political for three years, is a successful or more.
[2:56:50.800 --> 2:56:52.800]  I'm looking for leaders.
[2:56:52.800 --> 2:56:54.800]  I'm looking, if somebody's better than me,
[2:56:54.800 --> 2:56:56.800]  I'll put them on air and just turn everything over.
[2:56:56.800 --> 2:56:57.800]  This is a war, folks.
[2:56:57.800 --> 2:56:59.800]  I'm looking to win.
[2:56:59.800 --> 2:57:01.800]  And that's why we need your financial support.
[2:57:01.800 --> 2:57:03.800]  Our audience has never been bigger.
[2:57:03.800 --> 2:57:07.800]  Our funding is at the same level it was this time last year,
[2:57:07.800 --> 2:57:09.800]  and that's just not acceptable.
[2:57:09.800 --> 2:57:14.800]  Because I want to open bureaus in London, in L.A., in New York.
[2:57:14.800 --> 2:57:15.800]  I already started it in D.C.
[2:57:15.800 --> 2:57:17.800]  I want to hire, like, 50 people.
[2:57:17.800 --> 2:57:19.800]  I want to, I want to, quite frankly,
[2:57:19.800 --> 2:57:20.800]  I was talking to Cernovich last night.
[2:57:20.800 --> 2:57:22.800]  I want to, like, put him in charge of new, you know, new media.
[2:57:22.800 --> 2:57:23.800]  I just, I just want to hire everybody.
[2:57:23.800 --> 2:57:24.800]  I want to, I need plane tickets.
[2:57:24.800 --> 2:57:26.800]  I need money. I need money.
[2:57:26.800 --> 2:57:29.800]  Believe me, I'm looking to get the smaller house.
[2:57:29.800 --> 2:57:31.800]  It isn't about what, I have a stupid crap.
[2:57:31.800 --> 2:57:33.800]  You know, I've got these two blue jackets
[2:57:33.800 --> 2:57:34.800]  I've been wearing for six years.
[2:57:34.800 --> 2:57:36.800]  I'm starting to get holes in America about new ones.
[2:57:36.800 --> 2:57:38.800]  The point is, is that I want to win.
[2:57:38.800 --> 2:57:39.800]  I want to dominate the globalist.
[2:57:39.800 --> 2:57:42.800]  I want to tear their arms out of their sockets politically.
[2:57:42.800 --> 2:57:44.800]  You know, Grendel comes to attack us while we sleep.
[2:57:44.800 --> 2:57:46.800]  Grendel's going to go home to mommy, bleeding death politically.
[2:57:46.800 --> 2:57:48.800]  They want to run around so they're going to murder us all.
[2:57:48.800 --> 2:57:51.800]  I want to murder them financially, politically.
[2:57:51.800 --> 2:57:54.800]  We've got products that'll blow your socks off.
[2:57:54.800 --> 2:57:55.800]  It'll change your life.

[2:58:03.800 --> 2:58:06.800]  I don't need an extra two, three million dollars to work with.
[2:58:06.800 --> 2:58:09.800]  That sounds like a lot if you're, you know, living by yourself with your wife.
[2:58:09.800 --> 2:58:10.800]  That's nothing.
[2:58:10.800 --> 2:58:14.800]  I need hundreds of millions of dollars and I can defeat them all with your help.
[2:58:14.800 --> 2:58:16.800]  But hey, give me 10 million next year.
[2:58:16.800 --> 2:58:17.800]  I'll go to the next level.
[2:58:17.800 --> 2:58:18.800]  M4store.com.
[2:58:18.800 --> 2:58:20.800]  We're moving forward.
[2:58:20.800 --> 2:58:22.800]  We've got the charm.

[2:58:25.800 --> 2:58:27.800]  So most importantly, pray for M4Wars.
[2:58:27.800 --> 2:58:30.800]  Most importantly, thank you for all you've done and know I'm humble.
[2:58:30.800 --> 2:58:31.800]  And I'm doing as best I can.
[2:58:31.800 --> 2:58:33.800]  Lord knows I've got problems, but I'm committed.
[2:58:33.800 --> 2:58:35.800]  And I need your financial support at M4store.com.
[2:58:35.800 --> 2:58:36.800]  Commit today.
[2:58:36.800 --> 2:58:41.800]  Fourth hour with Mike Cernovich, more on Megan Kelly and more straight ahead.
[2:58:41.800 --> 2:58:42.800]  This is the info war.
[2:58:42.800 --> 2:58:45.800]  Spread the links, spread the videos, spread the articles.
[2:58:45.800 --> 2:58:47.800]  Commit, win, commit, win.
[2:58:47.800 --> 2:58:48.800]  They're in a war.
[2:58:48.800 --> 2:59:14.800]  They're going to defeat them.
[2:59:14.800 --> 2:59:19.800]  We have a lot of people who are in a war.
[2:59:19.800 --> 2:59:21.800]  We have a lot of people who are in a war.
[2:59:21.800 --> 2:59:23.800]  We have a lot of people who are in a war.
[2:59:23.800 --> 2:59:25.800]  We have refugees spreading disease around.
[2:59:25.800 --> 2:59:27.800]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[2:59:27.800 --> 2:59:28.800]  These are all parasites.
[2:59:28.800 --> 2:59:31.800]  Tell us about all the stuff that said there's so many things that are in it.
[2:59:31.800 --> 2:59:32.800]  You have the name in there.
[2:59:32.800 --> 2:59:35.800]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[2:59:35.800 --> 2:59:38.800]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[2:59:38.800 --> 2:59:39.800]  All right.
[2:59:39.800 --> 2:59:42.800]  Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[2:59:42.800 --> 2:59:44.800]  Support the broadcast, infowarslives.com.
[2:59:44.800 --> 2:59:46.800]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[2:59:46.800 --> 2:59:52.800]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[2:59:52.800 --> 3:00:07.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:00:07.800 --> 3:00:10.800]  Brings tears to my eyes.
[3:00:10.800 --> 3:00:14.800]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[3:00:14.800 --> 3:00:18.800]  It's Alex Jones.
[3:00:18.800 --> 3:00:22.800]  Again, I don't say this to be patronizing when I'm down, when I'm under attack.
[3:00:22.800 --> 3:00:25.800]  I need strength in my ancestors.
[3:00:25.800 --> 3:00:27.800]  I think about the women in my life.
[3:00:27.800 --> 3:00:30.800]  Those who have come, those who have gone, my dead grandmothers.
[3:00:30.800 --> 3:00:35.800]  I think in one person in particular, my father's mother got about 13 years ago.
[3:00:35.800 --> 3:00:37.800]  And she was hard on me.
[3:00:37.800 --> 3:00:38.800]  She wanted me to be good.
[3:00:38.800 --> 3:00:39.800]  She wanted me to be strong.
[3:00:39.800 --> 3:00:41.800]  And, you know, I got arguments with her and stuff.
[3:00:41.800 --> 3:00:44.800]  I even didn't see her for five years when I was a young man,
[3:00:44.800 --> 3:00:47.800]  because I was mad at her for confronting me about things.
[3:00:47.800 --> 3:00:49.800]  But my dad's mom was so strong.
[3:00:49.800 --> 3:00:54.800]  I never see any woman with...
[3:00:54.800 --> 3:00:57.800]  She had electricity in her eyes.
[3:00:57.800 --> 3:01:00.800]  And I think about how they've driven wedges between men and women.
[3:01:00.800 --> 3:01:02.800]  It's so satanic.
[3:01:02.800 --> 3:01:07.800]  And women that have sons and fathers that have daughters,
[3:01:07.800 --> 3:01:10.800]  you know what a joke this whole sexist thing is.
[3:01:10.800 --> 3:01:11.800]  It's all a fraud.
[3:01:11.800 --> 3:01:12.800]  We are humanity.
[3:01:12.800 --> 3:01:14.800]  And we stand against the globalists.
[3:01:14.800 --> 3:01:16.800]  And whatever it is, it's anti-human.
[3:01:16.800 --> 3:01:20.800]  The Bible says it's a fallen entity, not of this world.
[3:01:20.800 --> 3:01:21.800]  And it acts just like that.
[3:01:21.800 --> 3:01:24.800]  So whether you believe in the Bible or not, we're fighting Satanism.
[3:01:24.800 --> 3:01:26.800]  We're fighting people that want to kill us.
[3:01:26.800 --> 3:01:30.800]  And our strong men are a reflection of the women.
[3:01:30.800 --> 3:01:32.800]  And women need to know that.
[3:01:32.800 --> 3:01:36.800]  And men need to start acting like men and stop treating women like crap and be honorable.
[3:01:36.800 --> 3:01:40.800]  Mike Sernovich, tell us what you got coming up today, my friend.
[3:01:40.800 --> 3:01:47.800]  Well, you know, it's odd that you mentioned that because the closest person in my life was actually my grandmother.
[3:01:47.800 --> 3:01:55.800]  And probably one of the saddest things in my life that happened to me was I had a really bad medical condition that hit me.
[3:01:55.800 --> 3:01:57.800]  And I wasn't able to travel to her funeral.
[3:01:57.800 --> 3:02:03.800]  And she was this very strong woman in our life and watching her fall into dementia and stuff.
[3:02:03.800 --> 3:02:07.800]  And she realized, you know, like what you were saying, it is an attack on the women.
[3:02:07.800 --> 3:02:09.800]  My grandmother lived in the Great Depression.
[3:02:09.800 --> 3:02:10.800]  She worked a job.
[3:02:10.800 --> 3:02:14.800]  We hear all this nonsense in the feminist media, oh, about women at work.
[3:02:14.800 --> 3:02:21.800]  My grandma worked, you know, through the Depression, through World War II, throughout the years.
[3:02:21.800 --> 3:02:24.800]  And women always worked when they had to.
[3:02:24.800 --> 3:02:25.800]  Women always worked when they had to.
[3:02:25.800 --> 3:02:27.800]  And they want men and women, they want them hating each other.
[3:02:27.800 --> 3:02:32.800]  That's why when you had Cassie Jay on, a lot of people don't know because I don't, you know, I don't brag about this stuff.
[3:02:32.800 --> 3:02:36.800]  But her film was being censored by the globalist elite by the Hollywood.
[3:02:36.800 --> 3:02:39.800]  And you and your supporters helped force it out.
[3:02:39.800 --> 3:02:45.800]  So I said, I will match $10,000 from my readers and I will kickstart it with $10,000.
[3:02:45.800 --> 3:02:52.800]  So we did a big kickstarter, and that was what helped jumpstart her and get the film made because it's a powerful message.
[3:02:52.800 --> 3:02:53.800]  But the media will never tell you that.
[3:02:53.800 --> 3:02:56.800]  They'll just say, oh, sternum issues, massages, hate women.
[3:02:56.800 --> 3:03:04.800]  They'll never say that I did everything I could to help fund, promote a feminist, a female's movie that won an award for women in films.
[3:03:04.800 --> 3:03:06.800]  And that's why the news is fake.
[3:03:06.800 --> 3:03:12.800]  And that's why we have to fight so hard every day to attack these people because they truly are sinister forces.
[3:03:12.800 --> 3:03:17.800]  Well, there's no doubt they're attacking women first and foremost with 80% of their propaganda is admittedly focused on them.
[3:03:17.800 --> 3:03:19.800]  And it's just so dastardly.
[3:03:19.800 --> 3:03:23.800]  And then how the very enemies of women are the ones claiming to represent them.
[3:03:23.800 --> 3:03:26.800]  It's pure Satanism.
[3:03:26.800 --> 3:03:31.800]  Well, women are almost unhappy that they've ever been in American history.
[3:03:31.800 --> 3:03:33.800]  One in four women are on anti-depressants.
[3:03:33.800 --> 3:03:34.800]  You can look this up.
[3:03:34.800 --> 3:03:37.800]  So the women are actually the most unhappy that they've ever been.
[3:03:37.800 --> 3:03:38.800]  Men are unhappy.
[3:03:38.800 --> 3:03:40.800]  Everybody's at each other's throes.
[3:03:40.800 --> 3:03:42.800]  Everybody's trying to play the victim.
[3:03:42.800 --> 3:03:44.800]  And it is very sad.
[3:03:44.800 --> 3:03:49.800]  And once you recognize that that is a globalist plot to destroy the family unit, then it all makes sense.
[3:03:49.800 --> 3:03:54.800]  But that is, again, why the Cassie J, that film was 100% reader supported.
[3:03:54.800 --> 3:03:59.800]  And it's because it's so real and her experience is why they fear it.
[3:03:59.800 --> 3:04:00.800]  Exactly right.
[3:04:00.800 --> 3:04:07.800]  And they're terrified now of men and women uniting, of the races uniting.
[3:04:07.800 --> 3:04:09.800]  And you can see that all the time.
[3:04:09.800 --> 3:04:12.800]  That's why they call a sexist, racist, homophobic.
[3:04:12.800 --> 3:04:17.800]  Because they actually see that everybody's uniting around us, around patriotism, around truth, and around virtue and goodness.
[3:04:17.800 --> 3:04:19.800]  Humanity's bouncing back.
[3:04:19.800 --> 3:04:20.800]  Right, exactly.
[3:04:20.800 --> 3:04:23.800]  So people are definitely waking up.
[3:04:23.800 --> 3:04:26.800]  And for that reason, they're going after us even harder.
[3:04:26.800 --> 3:04:29.800]  I mean, that's why Megyn Kelly is attacking you on Father's Day.
[3:04:29.800 --> 3:04:30.800]  That is not an attack on you.
[3:04:30.800 --> 3:04:33.800]  You're just their pawn on the war against fathers.
[3:04:33.800 --> 3:04:35.800]  I'm glad you raised this because I didn't want to take over this hour.
[3:04:35.800 --> 3:04:38.800]  But if you want to do five more minutes, I'll let you take over and soon you'll have your own show.
[3:04:38.800 --> 3:04:39.800]  We're going to get launched next month.
[3:04:39.800 --> 3:04:41.800]  I'm getting it all hired right now.
[3:04:41.800 --> 3:04:42.800]  Great crew coming in.
[3:04:42.800 --> 3:04:43.800]  A lot of great people.
[3:04:43.800 --> 3:04:44.800]  I clicked.
[3:04:44.800 --> 3:04:45.800]  They said it was in July.
[3:04:45.800 --> 3:04:46.800]  Then they said Father's Day.
[3:04:46.800 --> 3:04:47.800]  And I heard the questions.
[3:04:47.800 --> 3:04:51.800]  They're saying I'm doing this on Father's Day to demonize the image of men.
[3:04:51.800 --> 3:04:52.800]  This is so sick.
[3:04:52.800 --> 3:04:54.800]  I want to get Mike Cernovich to take on that.
[3:04:54.800 --> 3:04:56.800]  He's hosting this hour.
[3:04:56.800 --> 3:05:25.800]  Stay with us in FullWars.com.
[3:05:26.800 --> 3:05:33.800]  Alex Jones, prior to just airing it, we can expect that they will be misrepresenting his statements with skilled editing techniques.
[3:05:33.800 --> 3:05:38.800]  Why not just release the entire interview unedited and prove you're not fake news, NBC?
[3:05:38.800 --> 3:05:47.800]  They'd like you to believe that Alex Jones, not Adam Lanza, is the real bad guy in the Sandy Hook Massacre because he said he believes there was a government conspiracy at work.
[3:05:47.800 --> 3:05:57.800]  However, all of this will backfire on the mainstream media as everyday Americans are increasingly becoming more aware of the staging, faking and lying that is the mainstream media.
[3:05:57.800 --> 3:06:17.800]  For more reports, go to infowars.com.
[3:06:17.800 --> 3:06:27.800]  If I ever forget to take them, I'm having noticeable difference. I don't feel good. The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life changing for me.
[3:06:27.800 --> 3:06:35.800]  Yeah, I've actually just run out of my superfemale. I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[3:06:35.800 --> 3:06:42.800]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good. And I know my hair is a little luxurious once again.
[3:06:42.800 --> 3:06:45.800]  So obviously the superfemale is amazing. I love it.
[3:06:45.800 --> 3:06:55.800]  The nascent iodine is essential. Survival Shield X2. If there's one product that I would say is life changing that I would suggest it's nascent iodine, Survival Shield X2.
[3:06:55.800 --> 3:07:19.800]  It's a 5 star rating. It's a win-win infowarslife.com.
[3:07:19.800 --> 3:07:28.800]  Biotrusillinium is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seed. The effects of the essential trace mineral selenium are well known.
[3:07:28.800 --> 3:07:37.800]  From supporting the thyroid gland and immune system to DNA production and eyesight, Biotrusillinium is also the perfect supercharger to Survival Shield X2 nascent iodine.
[3:07:37.800 --> 3:07:54.800]  As both help support a healthy thyroid and many other systems, visit infowarslife.com to order your bottle of Biotrusillinium before we sell it again.

[3:07:54.800 --> 3:08:04.800]  We didn't ask for this fight, but we're in this fight. This is the time to support InfoWars. That's infowarslife.com.
[3:08:04.800 --> 3:08:20.800]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[3:08:20.800 --> 3:08:29.800]  Mike Sarnovich is hosting the broadcast, one of the top investigative journalists in the world. Giant scoops continually. He'll have some big scoops for us obviously next week.
[3:08:29.800 --> 3:08:37.800]  A little bird told me. I just want to war game with him because I really respect his opinion. Unfortunately, I can't even put into action one-third of the great ideas he gives me on a daily basis.
[3:08:37.800 --> 3:08:45.800]  By the way, we're going to start playing the videos in the next few days. We're going to start giving attention. We've already sent out a few of the prizes. His idea, the CNN is a terrorist organization thing, $200,000.
[3:08:45.800 --> 3:08:55.800]  We've only sent out checks, I think, for like $6,000, $7,000 because I think I need to hire like three people that are just in charge of contests because I'm trying to watch these and then I want to get videos and then I want to air it.
[3:08:55.800 --> 3:09:09.800]  I appreciate you all. I'm blown away. I do not take you for granted. We don't do auto responses to emails. Then I'll have some nice lady walk over and say, I've sent you 20 emails and never got a response, but I got a response back from the governor.
[3:09:09.800 --> 3:09:20.800]  Listen, I'm not technical. I'm working 18 hours a day and I just know this. I'm doing the best I can. I'm not complaining. I just feel bad as a guy that's in a Texas hospitality not appreciating you enough.
[3:09:20.800 --> 3:09:29.800]  And again, that's not a butt kissing event. You are so amazing. I mean, I don't care if it's a black man or a black woman or an Asian lady or most people are mixed.
[3:09:29.800 --> 3:09:40.800]  I'm part Native American. The light in the eyes of the black people, particularly the grab my hand at grocery stores or on the street. I mean, it's like they're so alive beyond.
[3:09:40.800 --> 3:09:50.800]  It's just amazing. And then you see liberal black folks or white folks are like dead or Hispanic folks that are awake. I mean, they're just strong. They're focused. They know they they have a spirit. You connect.
[3:09:50.800 --> 3:09:58.800]  It's like you feel them. You feel you see them. I don't like new agey type stuff. But you know, it's like in the movie Avatar where they go, I see you. You know, I see them.
[3:09:58.800 --> 3:10:06.800]  And you see people like Megan Kelly. It was all gone. No humanity. And then she would turn on fake femininity, but it wasn't real. And it was repulsive.
[3:10:06.800 --> 3:10:11.800]  I didn't say that to hurt her feelings. You know, you ought to see the text messages I've been getting from her. That's a whole other story.
[3:10:11.800 --> 3:10:19.800]  I'm thinking about putting out and I've got to clarify a bunch of things also about what I think she's going to claim because she's desperate right now.
[3:10:19.800 --> 3:10:29.800]  But this is a this is a great time to be alive. This is a great challenge because we're just doing the right thing.
[3:10:29.800 --> 3:10:36.800]  And then as things arise, we deal with it. We're not calculating. We just have upfront straight up ideas about the right thing.
[3:10:36.800 --> 3:10:44.800]  We don't think about what comes out of it. But then doing the right thing is actually the three dimensional chess because we're already designed like that to the right thing because it's the right thing.
[3:10:44.800 --> 3:10:52.800]  It's the right thing because the brain is 100 times more powerful, the subconscious than the conscious. That's that first approximation isn't some off the top of the head failure.
[3:10:52.800 --> 3:11:02.800]  It's everything our ancestors, everything we've got on the line. And I'm just so blessed. I mean, I am blessed.
[3:11:02.800 --> 3:11:07.800]  People said to me this with you, man, you're really putting a good face on the demonization, the attacks and all the stuff you've been through.
[3:11:07.800 --> 3:11:12.800]  Megan Kelly even said that. Wow, they take, try to take your kids away, all this stuff. And I said to her, I said, no, I mean it.
[3:11:12.800 --> 3:11:17.800]  That I would do all this over again the same way. This is the animating contest of liberty. I am so blessed.
[3:11:17.800 --> 3:11:22.800]  I mean, I am just ashamed that I'm not stronger or better. This is an honor.
[3:11:22.800 --> 3:11:28.800]  Wherever this goes, this is so fulfilling. It's like the greatest drug on earth. No drugs needed.
[3:11:28.800 --> 3:11:35.800]  This is being a man. This is not shaming my family name, my ancestors. That's what that means. It's continuing on.
[3:11:35.800 --> 3:11:43.800]  So I don't know, should I release the full interview before she does so she can edit it? Do I wait until they release it to see what they did?
[3:11:43.800 --> 3:11:50.800]  Because I already know the promo pieces and stuff they said. It's a hit piece. Sernovich, you're a smart cookie, a lawyer, filmmaker, you name it.
[3:11:50.800 --> 3:11:57.800]  What should you give me advice the next five minutes? I'm going to get off here and let you host this route of me taking over, even though I know you can donate.
[3:11:57.800 --> 3:12:02.800]  What do you think I should do? What do you make of all this? What wrinkles do you see?
[3:12:02.800 --> 3:12:08.800]  Yeah, so I actually, I'm introducing a new character called Professor Sernovich and I'm going to explain the media strategy.
[3:12:08.800 --> 3:12:14.800]  But before we do that, I just want to say like, yeah, this is what people don't understand about you, me and the other people.
[3:12:14.800 --> 3:12:27.800]  Paul Joseph Watson, Stefan Maloney, the people who fight. I woke up today. My daughter got me up at 6.50 a.m., played with her, hiked, been working sources, been doing news, did a periscope, doing a video with you.
[3:12:27.800 --> 3:12:32.800]  We can work 18 hours a day because we're not spiritually bankrupt like Megyn Kelly.
[3:12:32.800 --> 3:12:43.800]  Megyn Kelly thinks this work. We wake up, like, to me, I just have to make it seem, I have to slow down because I look, you know, like a nutcase with so much energy and passion that it's becoming grounded.
[3:12:43.800 --> 3:12:46.800]  So the strategy that for you is...
[3:12:46.800 --> 3:12:53.800]  That's it. You're grounded to humanity. Who would want to be cut off from that great fount of history and the struggles we've had together?
[3:12:53.800 --> 3:13:04.800]  And that's why they want to teach people to not believe in any kind of God or spiritualism or religion. And, you know, black people, the Christian community is still very strong in that community.
[3:13:04.800 --> 3:13:06.800]  And that's why you can sense there's a lot of...
[3:13:06.800 --> 3:13:09.800]  That's why they've been targeted because they're so strong.
[3:13:09.800 --> 3:13:24.800]  And that's why they want to bankrupt them spiritually, too, is ultimately the liberals want, they feel vacant and empty inside and rather than connect themselves to the totality of our collective human unconscious and collective human experience into the universe.
[3:13:24.800 --> 3:13:31.800]  They want everybody to be disconnected and dead inside like they are. So that's why we call it a death cult for good reason.
[3:13:31.800 --> 3:13:33.800]  What do you think I should do with Kelly?
[3:13:33.800 --> 3:13:43.800]  Yeah, so what this has to do with Meg and Kelly is you are a... I don't want to call you a pawn. That sounds bad, but you're a move on the chessboard that...
[3:13:43.800 --> 3:13:46.800]  No, no, I totally agree. I put myself into the gambit to be destroyed if need be.
[3:13:46.800 --> 3:13:58.800]  Exactly. They're putting you on the board to attack all fathers. They're going to say, look at this guy. He's a bad father. He's hurting fathers. American fathers are terrible. That's why they're airing it on fathers.
[3:13:58.800 --> 3:14:06.800]  Just like all the Super Bowl ads are anti-father, everything. Exactly. And then they blame me that it's on fathers day when they're the ones that did it.
[3:14:06.800 --> 3:14:25.800]  Yeah, that's how they set it up and how they cut it. So then on fathers day, they can do a direct attack on fathers and then you're victimizing fathers and they want to unconsciously demean all fatherhood in America and they want everybody because they glorify the destruction and integration of men and of fathers.
[3:14:25.800 --> 3:14:31.800]  So that's the big play here. And it was all premeditated. How did they think we wouldn't be aware of that?
[3:14:31.800 --> 3:14:41.800]  Well, and that's what I was going to do the whole show. That's why I'm glad you're joining me because in the notes I sent to your first class producers, Daria and Nico, you have Yankees, man.
[3:14:41.800 --> 3:14:49.800]  And it's like the Chicago Bulls in their prime. And everything that we're going to talk about is the media stuff and what they don't understand yet.
[3:14:49.800 --> 3:14:57.800]  You know, Charlie Rossell, who wrote an article about it, he kind of gets some things and what they don't understand. Yeah, I saw the Rossell story. He thinks I'm like master calculating.
[3:14:57.800 --> 3:15:02.800]  He doesn't get, I'm just trying to do the right thing and praying to God.
[3:15:02.800 --> 3:15:13.800]  Well, what they don't really quite understand yet though is you're a filmmaker, you're an author, you're a journalist. We can cut things just like they can cut things.
[3:15:13.800 --> 3:15:18.800]  Exactly. We have our own outlet. It's not just the all powerful MSM having their way anymore.
[3:15:18.800 --> 3:15:26.800]  Right, exactly. So they come in and you think about it. If they do a hit piece on some guys, some, you know, regular good American, that person, what do you do?
[3:15:26.800 --> 3:15:33.800]  Write a letter to the editor. But really more people watch your stuff and our stuff than watch these cable news segments.
[3:15:33.800 --> 3:15:42.800]  But they don't understand it because I had HBO. HBO is actually planning a hit piece on me. They're doing a whole attack thing on me and they came out of my house.
[3:15:42.800 --> 3:15:51.800]  And Shawna, this is the first time she really, she's met a lot of these people and she was like, wow, what were they doing? And I go, well, they were trying to discredit and demean me.
[3:15:51.800 --> 3:15:57.800]  And they would say things like, oh, well, you must think you're a big deal. Oh, you must think you're important. Oh, must you think you're this or that?
[3:15:57.800 --> 3:15:58.800]  She did the same thing.
[3:15:58.800 --> 3:16:08.800]  Yeah. So the whole thing is to try to discredit independent media because what they don't understand yet, and this is what Charlie and others don't understand yet.
[3:16:08.800 --> 3:16:13.800]  I turned down 90% of media. I don't need the media to get my message out.
[3:16:13.800 --> 3:16:19.800]  You know, that's key because they're like, oh, giving you a platform. The show usually has five, six million viewers.
[3:16:19.800 --> 3:16:26.800]  They keep using the six million number for us. That's her numbers. We are really 45 million people a week, conservatively. You're reaching tens of millions.
[3:16:26.800 --> 3:16:33.800]  It's just crazy how they're acting like we need them and then they have the power. Will it air? It's just sick.
[3:16:33.800 --> 3:16:44.800]  Yeah, exactly. So when I went on 60 Minutes, they did 16 million viewers. They had never had ratings like that until 2008 when Barack and Michelle Obama did an initial interview.
[3:16:44.800 --> 3:16:52.800]  So I gave them their only ratings when in a decade, I give them Obama level when he was inaugurated Obama and Michelle level ratings.
[3:16:52.800 --> 3:16:58.800]  And then they go, you're giving me a platform. I turned down these people. The only reason I do it is if it's a challenge because I like it.
[3:16:58.800 --> 3:17:05.800]  Exactly. I knew they were planning a major sigh-up. I didn't know it would be this big. And I just said, God, do I do it? And God said, do it.
[3:17:05.800 --> 3:17:09.800]  I mean, God's got the knowledge. I just go, you know, what am I doing? Do it.
[3:17:09.800 --> 3:17:13.800]  Well, and that's exactly right because that's why people go, well, why did Alex agree to the interview?
[3:17:13.800 --> 3:17:21.800]  And I said, because you've got to understand it's a big challenge. You're going to go into the enemy territory. You know that the enemy is going to try and kill you.
[3:17:21.800 --> 3:17:25.800]  I'm going to let them wear me out. I'm going to let them do it all day. I'm going to let them wear me out.
[3:17:25.800 --> 3:17:32.800]  And I'm not doing the Christ analogy, but that we're all, you know, in the model of Christ, out in the desert, then he'd let himself be tempted.
[3:17:32.800 --> 3:17:38.800]  Let them wear you out. Let them do it. I mean, that was the whole point. Exactly. It's just, go into the lion's den.
[3:17:38.800 --> 3:17:44.800]  You know, see if God takes you out of it. Maybe it wasn't God's plan. Maybe I'm supposed to be destroyed this Sunday.
[3:17:44.800 --> 3:17:50.800]  Well, you're definitely not because the people are going to love you more because the people need champions, Alex.
[3:17:50.800 --> 3:17:57.800]  This is what people don't understand. This is what General Patton understood. And when Trump is on his game, this is what he understands.
[3:17:57.800 --> 3:18:06.800]  But Trump has been off his game for a little bit because he's getting bad advice. The people will hold you up, but you must also hold up the people at a servant leadership.
[3:18:06.800 --> 3:18:09.800]  We have no time for celebrities. We have to hold the people.
[3:18:09.800 --> 3:18:16.800]  Well, this isn't about celebrity. Exactly. It's a curse. And now America hates celebrity more and more and they know that.
[3:18:16.800 --> 3:18:23.800]  Exactly. So the people are there for you because you're there for the people every day because they know that you'll walk into NBC.
[3:18:23.800 --> 3:18:32.800]  They know that you'll let them at you. They know that you're going to fight back. They know you're not going to be like, like these GOP cocks who, oh my God, I'm sorry.
[3:18:32.800 --> 3:18:40.800]  I wish I hadn't said that. I was, oh, oh, beg me, you know, like they, they repent before the false God and pray before the false author.
[3:18:40.800 --> 3:18:42.800]  And that's what the people want. And that's what the people respect.
[3:18:42.800 --> 3:18:55.800]  Have you found, I don't say this to be some fancy or anything, but it's really true that the more you get attacked like in the ether and the more they persecute you, the discernment increases so much where I can't even handle it.
[3:18:55.800 --> 3:19:01.800]  It's actually scary. I just, I just can't believe people that serve evil. They have no idea what they're missing out on.
[3:19:01.800 --> 3:19:08.800]  Well, it plugs me into the energy. I mean, for me, I have infinite energy. I have to pretend right now.
[3:19:08.800 --> 3:19:18.800]  All of my willpower is actually being concentrated that I just don't explode into like a big, a big ball of fire or ether or something because I thought about what they're doing to you.
[3:19:18.800 --> 3:19:29.800]  And it's been, I've been so happy every day. I love watching them do this to you because I know that that is creating, because remember that their dark energy is going to create light energy.
[3:19:29.800 --> 3:19:37.800]  There's always life, plurality, men and women, good and evil. So the more evil that they unleash in the world, the more goodness comes.
[3:19:37.800 --> 3:19:41.800]  That's what Putin said in his Megan Kelly interview. He said, for every action, there's an opposite and equal reaction.
[3:19:41.800 --> 3:19:49.800]  They don't understand the more they spew at us, the stronger we get if we just don't buy the illusion that they're beating us because we know what really said.
[3:19:49.800 --> 3:19:56.800]  You know, I took my daughter to the dentist, got a tooth removed because one of the baby teeth didn't come out and had a long root.
[3:19:56.800 --> 3:19:58.800]  The point was she went to have it removed and I went to go to the door.
[3:19:58.800 --> 3:20:07.800]  And the lady at the counter when I was paying, she sees the card and jolts. The older lady goes, and then I watched her being nice.
[3:20:07.800 --> 3:20:13.800]  Other people kind of rude to me. And I just, I didn't really hold my head high. I just thought, you know, she's a victim. She's dumbed out. It's okay.
[3:20:13.800 --> 3:20:22.800]  And then later I saw her looking at me and then smiling and kind of shaking her head and then going through a process that she realized, hey, I bet that stuff I heard.
[3:20:22.800 --> 3:20:29.800]  I can even tell what she was thinking. I bet that stuff I heard wasn't true. And so I went even further while they were doing the procedure.
[3:20:29.800 --> 3:20:37.800]  I walked over to her and I said, you've been watching the news. She was, yeah, I know who you are. I saw what they said, but it kind of jolted me when I was thinking about it.
[3:20:37.800 --> 3:20:47.800]  But then I kind of remembered the media lie so much and I knew her process. I walked over and I heard the process and saw the humanity come back in her eyes.
[3:20:47.800 --> 3:20:55.800]  It was amazing. So it doesn't bother me to have people hate me because they're believing the lie the enemy told. That's not me.
[3:20:55.800 --> 3:21:02.800]  Well, they're hypnotized and you have to believe it's our job to be a form of evangelicals of truth.
[3:21:02.800 --> 3:21:10.800]  And so I pity people who hate me because I realized that they're cast under a spell, a very dark spell or black magic spell.
[3:21:10.800 --> 3:21:18.800]  And when people hate me for me, that's an opportunity for me to reawaken them. That's the enemy inside trying to keep them away from us.
[3:21:18.800 --> 3:21:26.800]  Exactly. They're a victim. It's kind of like if a child was abused and then if you go to say, hey, how are you doing?
[3:21:26.800 --> 3:21:30.800]  And the kid moves away is afraid. That isn't about you. That's about them.
[3:21:30.800 --> 3:21:36.800]  They've not been given the real love. So you're not being rejected. That's the fact that they never experienced love.
[3:21:36.800 --> 3:21:43.800]  Exactly. So they don't understand what's going on and they're projecting the negative energy that they've suffered on to you.
[3:21:43.800 --> 3:21:48.800]  And then when you filter through it that way and you understand what's really going on, you realize you're serving as a mirror.
[3:21:48.800 --> 3:21:52.800]  I know that you're not in the new age stuff, so I'll be, you know, I'll be careful.
[3:21:52.800 --> 3:21:56.800]  But I call it the magic mirror and the law of reflection is the hatred.
[3:21:56.800 --> 3:22:06.800]  I'm going to be clear. All of that's real, but it's the connection to God and ancestors and the willing to build something to a platform. You just can't imagine something that happened.
[3:22:06.800 --> 3:22:12.800]  You know, we're made the image of God as master creators. You know, they call Lucifer the master architect, but God's the architect. We're the architect.
[3:22:12.800 --> 3:22:20.800]  It's just, you just can't then imagine it. That's the new age. The point is you have to have the will, the time, the energy, the resources, and then we can do anything.
[3:22:20.800 --> 3:22:28.800]  Yeah, you unite vision and purpose and have it. So the magic mirror is when people hate you, they don't hate what they see. They don't actually see you.
[3:22:28.800 --> 3:22:35.800]  You're reflecting back their own inadequacies, their own failures, their own fears about the world.
[3:22:35.800 --> 3:22:41.800]  And that's why you have to remain tall and remain proud and realize you're holding up a mirror to all of existence.
[3:22:41.800 --> 3:22:52.800]  For a lot of people, they see that image and to them it's an ugly image and then rather than look inward and say, why am I an ugly person? They want to lash out at you and attack you.
[3:22:52.800 --> 3:23:06.800]  It's amazing. Wow. Well, Mike Cernovich, I'm just, I'm thinking, the problem is there's hours and hours of tape and I kind of need to see what they put out so that I can go back and actually find what I said to counter it.
[3:23:06.800 --> 3:23:12.800]  And of course, they're trying to float. They might sue me. You're a lawyer. I don't think they've got any case. It's a one party consent state. She was calling me.
[3:23:12.800 --> 3:23:18.800]  She was warranting that it wasn't going to be a hit piece. I knew it was. I mean, I need to be able to prove that she's a liar.
[3:23:18.800 --> 3:23:28.800]  Well, my philosophy, well, first of all, there's nothing illegal about recording somebody because I record them all the time because you have to have an expectation of privacy.
[3:23:28.800 --> 3:23:37.800]  If you put a microphone in my face, then there's no expectation of privacy. So that's nonsense. Now, could they sue you for damages, for ratings or whatever?
[3:23:37.800 --> 3:23:45.800]  I would love for NBC to sue you. That would be a PR like bonanza. That would be, you could get discovery. You could demand.
[3:23:45.800 --> 3:23:51.800]  Sure. The only way they might claim it is if I put the full interview out and they claim they're not ratings, they're going to have record ratings.
[3:23:51.800 --> 3:23:57.800]  But I tend to want to wait till it comes out just so that I can, if it's more fair, I'll say it's fair.
[3:23:57.800 --> 3:24:04.800]  But she's, she's re-editing it to be more anti-all exchange. She was always going to have the new town people. It was an investigative report.
[3:24:04.800 --> 3:24:09.800]  I'll tell you what I did with 60 minutes when I gave them record ratings and revived some careers.
[3:24:09.800 --> 3:24:11.800]  But Palais lost his job after that.
[3:24:11.800 --> 3:24:20.800]  Yeah. I transcribed the whole thing as that way I have, I could have everything sequenced, right? The whole thing transcribed.
[3:24:20.800 --> 3:24:27.800]  And I said, if they did me dirty, then I would release the full audio, but they didn't actually do me dirty. They were a little mean. They were a little critical.
[3:24:27.800 --> 3:24:35.800]  Palais was so delusional. He thought when he told you Hillary says she didn't fall down, the campaign said like that was God. You laughed at him.
[3:24:35.800 --> 3:24:39.800]  He didn't get, they had no more credibility. He was totally delusional.
[3:24:39.800 --> 3:24:47.800]  Right. So he called me fake news and threw a little shade my way. But to me, that's a fair fight. They didn't edit questions out of context.
[3:24:47.800 --> 3:24:51.800]  So I consider that piece on me on 60 minutes. I consider that real journey.
[3:24:51.800 --> 3:24:57.800]  And you won. And you won. And she wasn't going to let that happen. Putin gave her 15 minutes. He kicked her ass because they couldn't really edit it down.
[3:24:57.800 --> 3:25:05.800]  I gave them, like I said, almost 12 hours. So, I mean, from what I saw from the promo, my it is totally unrecognizable, what I said.
[3:25:05.800 --> 3:25:12.800]  Yeah. I would have the whole thing, the whole thing transcribed so you can write articles too. And then that'll also give you a time sequence.
[3:25:12.800 --> 3:25:21.800]  So then when they air a footage, then you have right on the tape where to do it. And then the problem is though, they'll then misrepresent what's in the video.
[3:25:21.800 --> 3:25:31.800]  If I wait till after, if I release it before, then people, the, the humet, the public will already in real time be analyzing where she lied and did things in the event.
[3:25:31.800 --> 3:25:38.800]  Maybe I should launch torpedoes now. You're, you're, no, because right now you've, you've owned the news cycle for a week. Okay.
[3:25:38.800 --> 3:25:47.800]  Little bit at a time, chopped your, your, your chop, chop, chopping away at the narrative. So right now you own the narrative already. You've already won. Okay.
[3:25:47.800 --> 3:25:51.800]  Right now I've been going with the water torture. That's what my gut told me.
[3:25:51.800 --> 3:25:59.800]  Yeah. You want it when you have a lot of, um, when you have a lot of attacks, you don't want to just go nuclear all at once. You want to hit them here, hit them here.
[3:25:59.800 --> 3:26:03.800]  Keep pounding away just like in boxing, work the body, work the body before the headshot.
[3:26:03.800 --> 3:26:12.800]  Let me ask you this. I agree. Do you think before the big uppercut, do you think they'll be more careful about the edit, or will they still just be arrogant and put out a total fiasco?
[3:26:12.800 --> 3:26:20.800]  Oh, they're shook. And in truth, they should just pull it because now they can't win. They're going to get the ratings when the Sandy Hook people are mad.
[3:26:20.800 --> 3:26:28.800]  You, if they do you dirty, tens of millions of people are going to watch them, expose them, right? Because we'll be doing it live.
[3:26:28.800 --> 3:26:36.800]  I'm going to be doing a live play-by-play of the video as it happens, right? This is like the big, this is Mayweather McGregor.
[3:26:36.800 --> 3:26:39.800]  I'm going to do it too. I almost wish you could fly out here.
[3:26:39.800 --> 3:26:45.800]  Yeah. This is, maybe we should do, maybe I would fly out for that and we could just all be in like a round table, you know, kind of talking.
[3:26:45.800 --> 3:26:47.800]  We'll, you know, we'll think about that.
[3:26:47.800 --> 3:26:53.800]  If you want to jump on a plane, we could do it here Sunday, maybe go on early like two to the fourth show, then take a break and then do it live and take calls.
[3:26:53.800 --> 3:26:57.800]  I don't know. Or maybe you could just be on this fiasco, but I was already thinking to do that too.
[3:26:57.800 --> 3:27:00.800]  Yeah. We'll do like around sort of how Joe Rogan has the UFC round table.
[3:27:00.800 --> 3:27:05.800]  I want to build a deal where we have like a big TV and then we cut up the round table exactly like Mystery Science Theater.
[3:27:05.800 --> 3:27:09.800]  Yeah, exactly. So then, you know, Joe, bring in Eddie Bravo and a few other guys.
[3:27:09.800 --> 3:27:17.800]  So we could, we could do that and just live stream it one, you know, whether we do it on Skype or in person or whatever and just get a round table of people.
[3:27:17.800 --> 3:27:22.800]  And then more people are going to watch that show than are watching the other shows were live commenting.
[3:27:22.800 --> 3:27:28.800]  And then as they're doing it dirty, you want to have production people on staff with videos preloaded.
[3:27:28.800 --> 3:27:30.800]  And then you just start launching those like Tom.
[3:27:30.800 --> 3:27:35.800]  I don't have the crew for that. We've got hours of this audio and then trying to chronicle it all.
[3:27:35.800 --> 3:27:40.800]  And, you know, the audio is from about 10 feet away. It's, it's good audio. It's kind of roomy, but I just can't believe this.
[3:27:40.800 --> 3:27:47.800]  I don't know what they're going to do. Cause I mean, I would say stuff like the third time she asked me about, you know, Sandy Hook, I'd say, listen,
[3:27:47.800 --> 3:27:55.800]  they lied about the babies and incubators and the WMDs. Of course it's okay to question stuff, but I thought, you know, and then she would just go, Iraq, you're dodging.
[3:27:55.800 --> 3:28:01.800]  And I knew then I even knew she's going to cut off that to make it just sound like I just said Iraq. And then sure enough, they did it.
[3:28:01.800 --> 3:28:04.800]  I mean, I can see what they're going to do. It's ridiculous.
[3:28:04.800 --> 3:28:10.800]  Well, and that's what HBO is going to do to me. But, you know, I have the recording, you just have to realize, and this is another thing too.
[3:28:10.800 --> 3:28:21.800]  Okay. And this is taught about the Bible to whom much is given, much is expected. You are given amazing talents and IQ off the charts, charisma, energy that nobody else will have.
[3:28:21.800 --> 3:28:30.800]  So you just have to take the blows. That is the way the universe works. You can't get all these great gifts and then be surprised when you're going to get attacked too.
[3:28:30.800 --> 3:28:36.800]  That's what's sad. Well, we all have great gifts. Most of them don't ever get expressed. I want to go out to break and you're going to take over.
[3:28:36.800 --> 3:28:43.800]  Mike, let's talk after the show as you both get busy with playing something. Again, Mike Cernovich also, we're going to come back and put the Tom Brokawk live and let you comment on that.
[3:28:43.800 --> 3:28:48.800]  I mean, he says I am a total complete racist, unalloyed racist with no proof.
[3:28:48.800 --> 3:28:53.800]  Talk about fake news, the Russian narrative. You have a guest coming up next segment, so I'll let you take over and do that.
[3:28:53.800 --> 3:28:58.800]  But if you want to comment on that, Mike Cernovich, thank you so much, my friend, take over.
[3:28:58.800 --> 3:29:03.800]  Yeah, no, I mean, it'll be a lot of fun and the attacks are the attacks are a great thing.
[3:29:03.800 --> 3:29:12.800]  The truth is, though, Alex and I had a big talk last night. This isn't public yet, but we're going to have a meeting and we want to build a whole team up.
[3:29:12.800 --> 3:29:18.800]  So that's why we need infowarstore.com. This is not, you know, I'm not driving a Ferrari. Alex says that we're not.
[3:29:18.800 --> 3:29:23.800]  This is war. This is war. By the way, separateinfowarstore.com for shipping. How do folks follow you?
[3:29:23.800 --> 3:29:28.800]  Because people are already awake. They're the info warriors. How do they help push out the great work you're doing on Twitter?
[3:29:28.800 --> 3:29:35.800]  Twitter.com forward slash my last name, C.E.R. and O.V.I.C.H. Twitter.com forward slash Cernovich.
[3:29:35.800 --> 3:29:40.800]  We have a great video exposing CNN for spreading fake news. We're going to actually play that in this segment.
[3:29:40.800 --> 3:29:44.800]  So we got a lot going on. I hope everybody is inspired up as you and I are.
[3:29:44.800 --> 3:29:59.800]  Wow, amazing. My Cernovich gives me so much energy. Wow.
[3:30:14.800 --> 3:30:21.800]  We have a great video by inviting Sandy Hook families on to play edited clips of Alex talking while they have the parents emotionally respond.
[3:30:21.800 --> 3:30:28.800]  One thing is for sure, with how long it's taking NBC to edit making Kelly's interview with Alex Jones prior to just airing it,
[3:30:28.800 --> 3:30:33.800]  we can expect that they will be misrepresenting his statements with skilled editing techniques.
[3:30:33.800 --> 3:30:38.800]  Why not just release the entire interview unedited and prove you're not fake news, NBC?
[3:30:38.800 --> 3:30:47.800]  They'd like you to believe that Alex Jones, not Adam Lanza, is the real bad guy in the Sandy Hook Massacre because he said he believes there was a government conspiracy at work.
[3:30:47.800 --> 3:30:54.800]  However, all of this will backfire on the mainstream media as everyday Americans are increasingly becoming more aware of the staging,
[3:30:54.800 --> 3:31:09.800]  faking and lying that is the mainstream media. For more reports, go to infowars.com.
