[06:12.500 --> 06:16.460]  electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[06:16.460 --> 06:20.820]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[06:20.820 --> 06:25.140]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[06:25.140 --> 06:28.900]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[06:28.900 --> 06:33.020]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[06:33.020 --> 06:36.980]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power

[10:32.700 --> 10:38.420]  packed if you're a radio listener and just tuned in this is the new media this
[10:38.420 --> 10:45.020]  is the integration of the long form lots of guests lots of news lots of
[10:45.020 --> 10:50.220]  information that talk radio can provide integrated with all the new
[10:50.220 --> 10:56.180]  technologies that are becoming more and more reliable of video Skype and other
[10:56.180 --> 11:01.340]  systems to be able to to send our reporters all over the world and bring
[11:01.340 --> 11:06.900]  it to you uncensored by the globalist remember three years ago Obama and
[11:06.900 --> 11:10.740]  Hillary met secretly at Bilderberg in Virginia we were there the whole world
[11:10.740 --> 11:14.660]  didn't know for a day where Hillary and Obama were they were in there making the
[11:14.660 --> 11:18.260]  deal for him to be president heard a step down we predicted it before it
[11:18.260 --> 11:22.060]  happened from our sources inside we called all the major national media and
[11:22.060 --> 11:26.380]  they said we want to come down there but we're not allowed to no newspapers
[11:26.380 --> 11:32.780]  nothing no mainstream media while it was the top story in the country in early
[11:32.780 --> 11:37.860]  June for a day where is Obama and Hillary remember Obama loaded all the
[11:37.860 --> 11:40.980]  people and in Dallas a few miles away from where they were meeting on the
[11:40.980 --> 11:43.940]  plane said he was getting on and the plane took off closed the doors they
[11:43.940 --> 11:48.300]  said where's Obama they actually Shanghai'd kidnap the reporters remember
[11:48.300 --> 11:51.980]  that big national story so they wouldn't follow Obama so he could go to that
[11:51.980 --> 11:56.500]  meeting even when we then called them and said here he is the motorcade just
[11:56.500 --> 12:00.940]  went in him and Hillary secret service with machine guns marines and playing
[12:00.940 --> 12:06.100]  clothes they said sorry we don't cover that now we are breaking that media
[12:06.100 --> 12:10.860]  blockade and that's why talk radio has always broken the establishment
[12:10.860 --> 12:14.340]  control blockade that's why they tried to have the fairness doctrine for it
[12:14.340 --> 12:17.380]  that's why they want to bring it back it's why they want FCC fairness doctrine
[12:17.380 --> 12:22.100]  on the internet as the White House regulations are cast Sunstein has written
[12:22.100 --> 12:27.540]  they do not want you getting what you are about to get here today now as soon as
[12:27.540 --> 12:31.140]  you get watching in them it's great to show the crowds of reporters something
[12:31.140 --> 12:35.260]  they dread and hate but let's let's get let's go up and talk to the police let's

[13:24.660 --> 13:29.220]  exactly where you are in St. Mort's what you're witnessing there and then as soon
[13:29.220 --> 13:33.900]  as you get off I want you to just do some panning video shots of the castle
[13:33.900 --> 13:40.620]  that they're the hotel of the police and I want you to go up with Tucker as we
[13:40.620 --> 13:45.540]  always do or yourself and be turned away I want you to go up and and have them
[13:45.540 --> 13:48.780]  tell you that you're turned away just to show folks exactly what's going on Paul
[13:48.780 --> 13:56.100]  Watson hello Alex yeah we're just down the hill from the hotels of Retta which
[13:56.100 --> 13:59.820]  is the hotel at Bilderberg a meeting out there was speculation that it would be
[13:59.820 --> 14:05.220]  the Kempinski but we drove there earlier and there was no activity so we've
[14:05.220 --> 14:10.660]  located the hotel and there's an excellent shot of the hotel from just up the
[14:10.660 --> 14:14.500]  road and that's where we're going to head in a moment we're gathered with the
[14:14.500 --> 14:20.700]  journalists from we are change Lou Bradoski etc of course Jim Tucker and
[14:20.700 --> 14:25.900]  we've been broadcasting on just in TV numerous videos so people can check out
[14:25.900 --> 14:31.020]  that Alex Jones channel for the live coverage and the archive videos but we're
[14:31.020 --> 14:36.140]  just at the bottom of the hill just in front of the security barrier there's
[14:36.140 --> 14:41.820]  private security there's police and as Lou Bradoski was saying in the just in
[14:41.820 --> 14:45.780]  TV video that we were just broadcasting live people have been asked for their
[14:45.780 --> 14:51.740]  ID and passports and Luke's passport was actually taken from him and held for 30
[14:51.740 --> 14:55.900]  minutes so the police is just saying that if you don't give us your ID we're
[14:55.900 --> 14:59.580]  going to arrest you and that's what's happening at the moment so we're about to
[14:59.580 --> 15:03.860]  head up the hill and get shots of the actual hotel itself okay are you saying
[15:03.860 --> 15:07.820]  you don't recommend then going up to the police line because you don't want them
[15:07.820 --> 15:15.240]  to grab your passport you can actually walk up the hill and get a shot of the
[15:15.240 --> 15:21.620]  hotel without breaking any kind of police barrier so but to be clear Paul to
[15:21.620 --> 15:26.420]  be clear Luke Radowski founder we are changes there reporting for RT he went
[15:26.420 --> 15:30.460]  up there just to the police line to talk to them and they grabbed his they
[15:30.460 --> 15:37.500]  demanded his passport yeah they held it for at least half an hour until he got
[15:37.500 --> 15:44.420]  it back well that's a that's a major news blurb that we need to get you to
[15:44.420 --> 15:49.060]  Twitter out then we'll have Curt Nimo or Matt Ryan both doing great jobs putting
[15:49.060 --> 15:54.500]  together your reporting that reporter Luke Radowski RT reporter had passport
[15:54.500 --> 16:01.780]  taken by Swiss police reporter has passport taken by Swiss police at
[16:01.780 --> 16:05.900]  Bilderberg Bill police guarding Bilderberg take reporters passport and
[16:05.900 --> 16:09.140]  then explain they gave it back 30 minutes and the detail we get a few
[16:09.140 --> 16:14.740]  paragraphs out on that that's very newsworthy but I also want to don't
[16:14.740 --> 16:17.780]  want to give away strategy I want to talk to you as soon as we got a break here
[16:17.780 --> 16:21.940]  in a few minutes to give you some directives Paul but I think it's important
[16:21.940 --> 16:25.500]  that at least one of you does go up there even if they do take the passport
[16:25.500 --> 16:28.940]  let it be a diplomatic row that you just as a reporter walk up and say what's
[16:28.940 --> 16:34.100]  going on here on the police Alex what they're claiming is that in Switzerland
[16:34.100 --> 16:38.060]  and I believe this is true because I've read it before if you're not a Swiss
[16:38.060 --> 16:43.380]  citizen if you're an immigrant or a tourist they can demand your ID whether
[16:43.380 --> 16:48.260]  they can hold it is another question no I understand I understand that the issue
[16:48.260 --> 16:53.540]  is the New York Times as you know three years ago doing a review of the New
[16:53.540 --> 16:59.580]  World Order film on IFC said that I was delusional having hallucinations at the
[16:59.580 --> 17:05.580]  Chantilly Marriott while Bilderberg was meeting and that Obama wasn't there
[17:05.580 --> 17:10.980]  Hillary wasn't there nobody was there you know they said we were insane so and
[17:10.980 --> 17:15.340]  that's still said by our media so we need they'll just say oh that's a shot of a
[17:15.340 --> 17:20.180]  hotel we need they want to keep their hoax going remember just a few years ago
[17:20.180 --> 17:23.420]  this still didn't exist more and more they're having to admit it while at the
[17:23.420 --> 17:27.380]  same time saying it doesn't exist because they have pure disdain for their
[17:27.380 --> 17:31.460]  readers so I'll talk to you during the break now Paul continuing before you'll
[17:31.460 --> 17:35.420]  get that live shot and photo shots for everybody at info wars comm and
[17:35.420 --> 17:39.260]  watching at prison planet TV and all the radio listeners no info wars comm and
[17:39.260 --> 17:43.100]  follow this video and everything that's happening again 21st century cutting
[17:43.100 --> 17:46.740]  edge media years ago these technologies didn't work well enough for us to use
[17:46.740 --> 17:51.380]  them a lot now they're really working well very very exciting this this really
[17:51.380 --> 17:55.300]  evens the playing field to a great extent towards the dinosaur media let's
[17:55.300 --> 17:59.100]  talk about the breaking news that Swiss papers are reporting that they're
[17:59.100 --> 18:03.460]  choosing the new IMF head at this meeting that's something that should be in
[18:03.460 --> 18:08.700]  our news here with Dominique Strauss-Kahn dominating news coverage well the
[18:08.700 --> 18:13.620]  thing is that Swiss newspapers yesterday reported that Bilderberg had no
[18:13.620 --> 18:18.220]  power and yesterday we picked up newspapers and the main headline was
[18:18.220 --> 18:22.740]  the fact that Bilderberg is choosing the new IMF head to replace Strauss-Kahn
[18:22.740 --> 18:26.900]  and we showed the front page of the newspaper on our video broadcast earlier
[18:26.900 --> 18:31.460]  which is on info wars and prison planet and it's just another indication that
[18:31.460 --> 18:36.460]  they do have real power and they exercise it on a regular basis much to the
[18:36.460 --> 18:42.820]  chagrin of debunkers who often claim otherwise so basically the majority of
[18:42.820 --> 18:46.740]  the Swiss newspapers are now reporting on it and it's on the front page of two
[18:46.740 --> 18:51.660]  major Swiss newspapers that Bilderberg are deciding the new IMF head to replace
[18:51.660 --> 18:58.420]  Strauss-Kahn now Paul you guys have two video cameras two cell phone cameras you

[19:34.980 --> 19:38.820]  men hiding behind trees and that there's no one there they will say there's no
[19:38.820 --> 19:42.100]  one there they don't care if it's all over the Swiss papers we've got to have
[19:42.100 --> 19:45.820]  photos of the cops with the submachine guns or they'll say they don't exist we'll

[25:10.740 --> 25:15.300]  from Bilderberg continually updated why is this so important they're so powerful
[25:15.300 --> 25:19.820]  for 50 years they kept it secret only the last five or six did they have to
[25:19.820 --> 25:25.700]  admit that it was real and that's why this is so important Paul Watson give
[25:25.700 --> 25:30.020]  us more intel on specifically who they're looking on trying to install as the
[25:30.020 --> 25:37.060]  new head of the IMF our banker owners there's no one that any information that I
[25:37.060 --> 25:41.660]  could see obviously we don't read German as to who it was thought the headline
[25:41.660 --> 25:48.940]  was Bilderberg to choose successor for Strauss card and that's what we worked
[25:48.940 --> 25:53.500]  out from the translation which was in the newspaper now we've got sources as
[25:53.500 --> 25:57.980]  well and Kurt's translating it yes it looks like they made pic we're gonna
[25:57.980 --> 26:00.860]  have that name and more information Kurt gave to me during the break but all of
[26:00.860 --> 26:05.020]  this is unfolding and what's important is they decide when the Berlin Wall goes
[26:05.020 --> 26:08.340]  down they decide when to launch a new war we've gotten their internal documents
[26:08.340 --> 26:12.700]  before this is as close to the secret smoky new world order mafia room as it

[26:33.060 --> 26:37.780]  at info wars calm that we haven't bedded but any other tidbits of Intel you
[26:37.780 --> 26:41.980]  can relay to the worldwide listeners as you cover the global crime syndicate
[26:41.980 --> 26:48.140]  meeting yeah we were talking to Jim Tucker and we broadcast one of these
[26:48.140 --> 26:52.660]  videos on Justin TV which should be archived and he was relating the fact
[26:52.660 --> 26:56.940]  that his thoughts are telling him that Bilderberg is petrified about the
[26:56.940 --> 27:02.500]  resistance within Congress to their conquest of Libya and of course we've
[27:02.500 --> 27:08.100]  had Rand Paul in recent weeks demanding that Obama legally justify the attack
[27:08.100 --> 27:11.940]  because of course it's gone over 60 days which is in the War Powers Act but
[27:11.940 --> 27:18.580]  that's unconstitutional so Jim Tucker say that Bilderberg are petrified of the
[27:18.580 --> 27:22.100]  fight that the resistance that that is building within Congress and that it
[27:22.100 --> 27:27.020]  may be brailed their plan for Libya he also said that Bilderberg are planning
[27:27.020 --> 27:32.500]  a gigantic war in the Middle East which of course would stretch beyond Libya
[27:32.500 --> 27:39.420]  and engulf the whole area so that is on the agenda again and by the way Jim came
[27:39.420 --> 27:43.460]  out three months before and said Bush will endorse within six months carbon
[27:43.460 --> 27:47.460]  taxes everybody laughed at him happened Jim said the Berlin wall will fall and
[27:47.460 --> 27:51.100]  called the month Margaret Thatcher will be fired called it later she talked to
[27:51.100 --> 27:55.940]  him on record said yes they ran me out he really has multiple sources I'm
[27:55.940 --> 27:59.540]  getting shells right now ladies and gentlemen these are the people steering
[27:59.540 --> 28:03.700]  our planet and they and they are scared they are upset by the demonstrators
[28:03.700 --> 28:08.620]  they're upset by the coverage we've got the intel streaming in from our sources
[28:08.620 --> 28:16.260]  right now Paul Watson anything else that Jim told you from his sources we've
[28:16.260 --> 28:22.140]  got a bit just in TV there were numerous things that those were the main ones I've

[36:07.780 --> 36:11.340]  dates never tell the person to be there and then arrest them for failure to
[36:11.340 --> 36:16.500]  appear and then intimidate them there are police they're up close to the

[36:37.260 --> 36:42.660]  world cannot be paid back sucking the country dry 27 trillion most of it went
[36:42.660 --> 36:46.540]  to foreign banks as we told you for years we were right now admitted in the
[36:46.540 --> 36:51.180]  Bloomberg suit getting the documents do you realize there are the criminals
[36:51.180 --> 36:55.180]  there are the people openly wanting world government openly wanting carbon
[36:55.180 --> 36:59.540]  taxes to shut down all their competition and selectively let GE heads who do

[37:03.420 --> 37:07.300]  supporters and globalists not have to buy the insurance Aaron Dykes they're
[37:07.300 --> 37:11.820]  reporting from Switzerland as World War three has prepared the Middle East
[37:11.820 --> 37:16.460]  openly ran corporation calling for it as the dollar plunges as they talk about
[37:16.460 --> 37:21.340]  dollar default as Moody's and S&P say it may default as everything begins to
[37:21.340 --> 37:26.100]  accelerate there you are and where is the international mainstream media know
[37:26.100 --> 37:30.060]  where to be seen Swiss news with insiders reporting they're preparing to
[37:30.060 --> 37:33.820]  pick the new IMF head not the governments of Europe in the US but the
[37:33.820 --> 37:39.180]  corporate leaders this is incredible Aaron Dykes I mean I'm excited folks this
[37:39.180 --> 37:43.180]  is this you get excited about football games folks and the pregame I get
[37:43.180 --> 37:47.340]  excited about my children's future and identifying the globalist because if we
[37:47.340 --> 37:51.180]  identify them and not their front puppets as Brzezinski said last year as
[37:51.180 --> 37:56.140]  he warned the CFR that the world was awakening it's over they can't commit
[37:56.140 --> 38:02.620]  these crimes people are rioting worldwide from Greece to Iceland to
[38:02.620 --> 38:09.580]  Portugal to Spain to Ireland the Irish Times says we Ireland is being
[38:09.580 --> 38:14.980]  conquered by private banks we must stop the bailouts which are again the
[38:14.980 --> 38:18.580]  bankers say they owe this our pension funds are all tied into it they hold
[38:18.580 --> 38:22.460]  its hostage and say give us unlimited trillions pay us carbon taxes or we'll
[38:22.460 --> 38:26.500]  destroy you Aaron you are there in the belly of the beast I salute you tell
[38:26.500 --> 38:31.760]  us what's happening Alex I'm here surrounded 360 degrees by the beautiful
[38:31.760 --> 38:38.620]  Swiss Alps with next to the biggest hotel the hotel Suvretta overlooking the
[38:38.620 --> 38:43.260]  rest of the area here in San Maritz they've got private security as well as
[38:43.260 --> 38:47.340]  police they said the private security has been here since yesterday our sources
[38:47.340 --> 38:53.300]  tell us they have makeshift surveillance cameras on every rooftop and subgroup
[38:53.300 --> 38:57.740]  top they have floodlights I guess they could see if anyone is sneaking around
[38:57.740 --> 39:03.580]  they've got ID checkpoints a cordon set up all around the perimeter they've
[39:03.580 --> 39:07.140]  even tried to block off part of the view at the security checkpoint where they
[39:07.140 --> 39:11.940]  have a trailer set up for the limos to come through so the attendees can't be
[39:11.940 --> 39:17.820]  easily photographed as they come in and it's quite a scene we've got we are
[39:17.820 --> 39:21.740]  changers here from here in Switzerland and elsewhere in Europe right now
[39:21.740 --> 39:27.060]  there's a couple dozen they're expecting as many as 200 even 500 later in the
[39:27.060 --> 39:32.060]  week so we'll see how that plays out but they also say some of the attendees
[39:32.060 --> 39:36.100]  have all already arrived others obviously will be coming in tomorrow oh
[39:36.100 --> 39:42.060]  yeah I saw some of the Maybach super Mercedes and others going in I've seen
[39:42.060 --> 39:45.940]  those before they're there and if we see diplomatic cars coming in you know
[39:45.940 --> 39:49.460]  Hillary's in Europe right now with her special friend that's a whole nother
[39:49.460 --> 39:55.580]  scandal that is the wife of wiener so wiener gates only the tip of the wiener
[39:55.580 --> 40:00.700]  gate we've got all that happening this is so huge and we've got Tucker and others
[40:00.700 --> 40:05.100]  with inside intel give us some of the things that you that our inside sources
[40:05.100 --> 40:09.220]  are telling us are on the agenda some years Tucker source even since him the
[40:09.220 --> 40:14.460]  internal agenda report you get that immediately get it out those can also
[40:14.460 --> 40:19.820]  follow it at americanfreepress.net give us your report Aaron well of course a
[40:19.820 --> 40:24.540]  lot of it Paul Watson just relayed to you but of course they do want a wider
[40:24.540 --> 40:30.020]  war according to Tucker sources and it makes perfect sense they've primed the
[40:30.020 --> 40:35.300]  field with the Arab Spring and the semi nonviolent although of course a lot of
[40:35.300 --> 40:40.620]  violence behind the scenes kind of under the covers the hot war in Libya which is
[40:40.620 --> 40:45.460]  likely to expand further and obviously they're looking at Syria and other
[40:45.460 --> 40:50.820]  locales surrounding the Iran point on the map of course we also have the
[40:50.820 --> 40:55.460]  Dominic Trostan news breaking that they're looking to replace by way of
[40:55.460 --> 41:00.420]  parallel you remember a couple years ago Paul Wolfowitz had his own sex scandal
[41:00.420 --> 41:05.780]  for hiring his mistress at the World Bank he stepped down just before that
[41:05.780 --> 41:11.940]  years conference at Bilderberg and they reportedly did choose a successor there
[41:11.940 --> 41:16.140]  in the meeting which ended up being of course Robert Zollick head of the World
[41:16.140 --> 41:21.700]  Bank unbelievable and Kurt Scott the intel there are sources that they're
[41:21.700 --> 41:26.660]  looking at a particular finance minister out of Mexico to head up the IMF that
[41:26.660 --> 41:30.700]  would be a big shakeup because when they go through these rounds it's just like
[41:30.700 --> 41:35.340]  Bilderberg only comes to the US every four years three of the four years they
[41:35.340 --> 41:41.700]  meet in continental Europe or England now the word is usually only one out of
[41:41.700 --> 41:51.020]  four years or rounds of IMF head position will it be an American so if
[41:51.020 --> 41:57.580]  it's a Mexican that'll show another major North American Union because of
[41:57.580 --> 42:00.660]  course the World Bank traditionally goes to an American the IMF
[42:00.660 --> 42:05.500]  traditionally to a European so if they were to bring Mexico under the fold that
[42:05.500 --> 42:10.580]  is quite an expansion and obviously a sign they want to partner with other
[42:10.580 --> 42:14.780]  developing nations and bring more people into the centralized global
[42:14.780 --> 42:18.820]  government system Aaron we're going to continue to check in with you and coming
[42:18.820 --> 42:22.980]  up in the third hour we're going to do a video Skype from the hotel I may
[42:22.980 --> 42:29.220]  actually change that and just have you guys from the site continue to report
[42:29.220 --> 42:35.180]  and then perhaps do a overdrive with you guys today for those that don't know
[42:35.180 --> 42:38.540]  what overdrive is it's up on the satellites if stations want it but it's
[42:38.540 --> 42:43.820]  also at prisonplanet.tv the audio and video streams at info wars.com so play
[42:43.820 --> 42:48.540]  it by ear I'll let you know in the next 45 minutes talking to you off air
[42:48.540 --> 42:51.420]  whether you want to stay there at Bilderberger go to your hotel to start
[42:51.420 --> 42:56.340]  filing your reports and also doing the video feeds but we've got so much news
[42:56.340 --> 43:00.900]  here there's a media blackout in the United States drudge is the only place
[43:00.900 --> 43:06.460]  on Monday that did carry our report about the high-level Swiss politician
[43:06.460 --> 43:09.860]  basically a member of their Congress calling for Kissinger's arrest if he
[43:09.860 --> 43:15.940]  shows up so we're waiting for drudges and he died in in France also and he
[43:15.940 --> 43:20.100]  and he also died in France and under EU rules he should be arrested but
[43:20.100 --> 43:25.140]  Switzerland kept his sovereignty so then the globalists can still come into
[43:25.140 --> 43:30.180]  there the power of sovereignty is a double-edged sword of course the EU is
[43:30.180 --> 43:33.340]  not going to arrest Kissinger to begin with but who knows what could happen
[43:33.340 --> 43:37.380]  continue to watch that we've got another headline that needs to get out that
[43:37.380 --> 43:42.780]  there is a high-tech surveillance grid of police and makeshift cameras that they
[43:42.780 --> 43:46.100]  are planning a gigantic war that they're looking at the new IMF had they're
[43:46.100 --> 43:50.940]  pushing a they're worried that there's an awakening in Congress to Obama saying
[43:50.940 --> 43:54.100]  that the Libyan war would last days not weeks now they're saying it'll last
[43:54.100 --> 43:58.500]  into Christmas into next year maybe for years as long as it takes and again we've
[43:58.500 --> 44:02.380]  got video feeds right now of Aaron joining us on air let's continue with
[44:02.380 --> 44:06.620]  that shot with the Swiss Alps in the background I envy you guys but I've
[44:06.620 --> 44:11.620]  got to stay here in the rear with the gear and direct all of this Aaron
[44:11.620 --> 44:17.140]  continuing any other points that you'd like to add for folks well you know it's
[44:17.140 --> 44:22.100]  hard to know off off and how clear the video is these tripods it's crystal clear
[44:22.100 --> 44:28.020]  surveillance cameras can hear me I'm sorry go ahead just to be clear in case
[44:28.020 --> 44:32.340]  the video is not they have these surveillance cams on makeshift tripods
[44:32.340 --> 44:37.940]  really about every 10 to 20 feet on every ledge every sub roof top of this
[44:37.940 --> 44:43.500]  enormous and very gorgeous hotel so that's very interesting ask Paul ask Paul
[44:43.500 --> 44:48.340]  ask Paul who's shooting live video right now for viewers and info wars.com to
[44:48.340 --> 44:51.980]  center the camera because you can't really zoom with that while you're
[44:51.980 --> 44:56.540]  streaming center the camera with center on those tripods yes center on the
[44:56.540 --> 45:01.220]  tripods and people can then focus in and see the cameras is that what looks like
[45:01.220 --> 45:05.340]  a lamp post right there is that the cameras you're talking about there's
[45:05.340 --> 45:11.580]  lamp posts in the foreground beyond that you'll see a short ledge with a
[45:11.580 --> 45:15.740]  building that is at its highest point about 10 feet and flows point only about
[45:15.740 --> 45:21.420]  four feet yeah tell Paul tell Paul is there tell Paul and center on those
[45:21.420 --> 45:24.940]  cameras please yeah and tell Paul to stay there I want you to step in front of
[45:24.940 --> 45:29.340]  him for folks watching and and step in front of Paul and let me step in
[45:29.340 --> 45:33.180]  front of it and then point back up just a bit because we're right up against this
[45:33.180 --> 45:38.220]  cordoned off zone here but as you can see behind me there are the makeshift
[45:38.220 --> 45:43.020]  surveillance cams which I have not seen at the previous years in addition to the
[45:43.020 --> 45:47.980]  surveillance cams every few feet every 10 or 20 they have floodlights just to
[45:47.980 --> 45:52.300]  make sure obviously that they're seeing everything that's going on so it's an
[45:52.300 --> 45:56.380]  interesting development and media is so dangerous and so evil compared to the
[45:56.380 --> 46:01.900]  globalist criminals okay we see you Aaron point directly to where it's at
[46:01.900 --> 46:07.180]  okay you can see here the first surveillance cam and then behind it on
[46:07.180 --> 46:11.020]  the higher left there's another one next to it a bank of lights behind that off
[46:11.020 --> 46:15.660]  to the right a second bank of lights further off to the left more banks of
[46:15.660 --> 46:21.140]  lights more surveillance cams all on these lower ledge roofs and that's just
[46:21.140 --> 46:25.340]  of course what's visible because we know they're snipers in place smaller
[46:25.340 --> 46:28.940]  cameras surveilling for the ceilings obviously it's an extremely high
[46:28.940 --> 46:33.580]  security zone all right I'm gonna make a call right here let's go ahead and do
[46:33.580 --> 46:36.700]  the third hour with you guys via video Skype but if you're not ready by then
[46:36.700 --> 46:40.820]  we'll just push it the last half hour get I see you got the high-powered 35
[46:40.820 --> 46:45.220]  millimeter lens there that's what your support folks paid for so we can able to
[46:45.220 --> 46:49.580]  bring you this hardcore coverage this cutting-edge 21st century coverage get
[46:49.580 --> 46:53.820]  shots of the cops with that super high-def 35 mil get shots of the flood
[46:53.820 --> 46:59.300]  lights get shots of it all get back foul blurb reports at info wars and prison
[46:59.300 --> 47:04.460]  planet as articles will then take those and put them into master articles for
[47:04.460 --> 47:08.100]  drudge and others that I know are standing by for this breaking news
[47:08.100 --> 47:13.380]  coverage so spend another 20 minutes there and then get back to the hotel and
[47:13.380 --> 47:19.100]  file your reports because obviously you can also take Twitter photos with your
[47:19.100 --> 47:24.620]  how many megapixels are those iPhones and then here at our office right now we
[47:24.620 --> 47:28.500]  could blow up the still photos that you're posting at our Twitter feed at
[47:28.500 --> 47:33.900]  info wars.com and then we can blow those up here and get that out to people as
[47:33.900 --> 47:37.820]  well and you're in the field Aaron I'm just the general back here at command
[47:37.820 --> 47:42.420]  base Delta what do you want to do that's my idea but you're in command there on
[47:42.420 --> 47:46.780]  the ground what do you want to do I think that makes perfect sense Alex so well
[47:46.780 --> 47:51.380]  I mean you think that's a good idea yeah we'll take this area out for another
[47:51.380 --> 47:55.780]  20 minutes and then we will head back to the hotel for a high quality connection
[47:55.780 --> 47:59.980]  for later in the program and I'm sure by then we're gonna know even more because
[47:59.980 --> 48:04.900]  there's limos constantly coming in a lot of them are empty but I believe they
[48:04.900 --> 48:09.020]  keep them in a continuous loop that way any arrivals don't have to be in
[48:09.020 --> 48:14.020]  convenience for one thing also if they need to access other areas yeah without
[48:14.020 --> 48:18.900]  being seen you know do we have a we have the 2000 Superzoom video camera
[48:18.900 --> 48:22.540]  obviously you guys are staking out a good place to start early in the morning
[48:22.540 --> 48:27.460]  when the global scum arrives in mass just like I got footage of Queen Beatrix
[48:27.460 --> 48:32.980]  and David Rockefeller and others so obviously find a good cat bird seat right
[48:32.980 --> 48:35.660]  you can get on a mountain top and zoom in on their faces with that camera we
[48:35.660 --> 48:40.500]  got yeah it's an excellent camera and it's worth noting by the way there's no
[48:40.500 --> 48:45.860]  true freedom of the press or freedom of speech here the police are asking for
[48:45.860 --> 48:50.460]  passports in many cases and we've learned from our sources if you refuse you
[48:50.460 --> 48:54.740]  can be arrested on the spot so that's another aspect of the police state area
[48:54.740 --> 48:59.220]  yeah they took Luke's passport for 30 minutes yeah that's right did you

[54:08.260 --> 54:11.100]  group is meeting is just popping in with us for a few minutes he'll be back
[54:11.100 --> 54:15.580]  later today with Aaron and Paul Watson all reporting he is an RT Russian
[54:15.580 --> 54:21.500]  today reporter for course founder of the organization we are change anti-globalist
[54:21.500 --> 54:26.740]  organization briefly Luke tell us how they took your passport why they did it
[54:26.740 --> 54:30.980]  what happened I mean as soon as I came here as you know I started making a little
[54:30.980 --> 54:34.380]  bit noise I tried to actually walk in there to have a dinner and I got shoved
[54:34.380 --> 54:38.660]  by one of police officers and then 30 to 40 minutes after that a whole bunch of
[54:38.660 --> 54:42.460]  police officers ran up on the crowd and demanding passwords they came up right
[54:42.460 --> 54:45.740]  to me and they're like we want his passport we want to see your documents
[54:45.740 --> 54:49.940]  in their language that we had somebody translate I asked them why and we were
[54:49.940 --> 54:54.140]  informed that if we do not give our IDs when asked even without probable cause
[54:54.140 --> 54:58.580]  that we will be sent to jail here in Switzerland that's how tyrannical here
[54:58.580 --> 55:02.740]  the police are acting right now and they actually took my passport for about 30
[55:02.740 --> 55:07.380]  40 minutes documented to read it down and I guess I'm yet on another database
[55:07.380 --> 55:12.300]  somewhere so that's what happened here I hear the private security company has an
[55:12.300 --> 55:18.020]  all-seeing eye as their symbol yeah it's pretty old rallying here I mean it's
[55:18.020 --> 55:21.020]  pretty crazy with the surveillance cameras and lights that they're setting up
[55:21.020 --> 55:24.820]  here there's police officers all over the place they even put up a white tarp so
[55:24.820 --> 55:28.860]  nobody could take photographs of the cars coming in here just like we you know
[55:28.860 --> 55:33.660]  previously documented matter right they're rolling out the red carpet for
[55:33.660 --> 55:37.860]  the banksters just take all their stolen loot from us and bank it there and you
[55:37.860 --> 55:43.460]  did catch of course Bernanke there years ago in Virginia Madeline Albright so
[55:43.460 --> 55:46.380]  they're really rolling out the red carpet form it looks like compared to
[55:46.380 --> 55:50.100]  anything we've ever seen look exactly and even I'm here talking to we are
[55:50.100 --> 55:53.340]  changing Switzerland they're telling me that this is a public street that they're
[55:53.340 --> 55:57.100]  blocking off they're having private security teams working with the Swiss
[55:57.100 --> 56:01.580]  military and Swiss police blocking off a public sidewalk right here threatening
[56:01.580 --> 56:04.180]  people would arrest and we've been informed there's no freedom of speech
[56:04.180 --> 56:08.700]  here there's no we have pretty much no right here so we have to be pretty
[56:08.700 --> 56:11.940]  careful but we're you know we're still gonna stand our ground and we're gonna
[56:11.940 --> 56:15.140]  document everything as we can and we're gonna try to send the message to the
[56:15.140 --> 56:19.140]  leaders banksters who are trying to rule this world right now that we're not
[56:19.140 --> 56:22.500]  going away and we're gonna expose them as much as we can this is the criminals

[01:02:00.220 --> 01:02:05.100]  articles up at info wars dot com confirmed from the Idaho statesman big
[01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:08.980]  boil down on this from the American dream China wants to construct a 50
[01:02:08.980 --> 01:02:13.820]  square miles self-sustaining city south of Boise Idaho this is what Mexico the
[01:02:13.820 --> 01:02:17.340]  North American Union tried to do in Kansas City this is the new model of
[01:02:17.340 --> 01:02:20.860]  these globalist free trade zones where they're above the laws nothing gets
[01:02:20.860 --> 01:02:23.700]  searched they can bring in whatever they want they can leverage out all the
[01:02:23.700 --> 01:02:28.540]  local businesses it's the same model of the insiders being above the law and
[01:02:28.540 --> 01:02:32.820]  basically having diplomatic immunity these are diplomatic zones and it's the
[01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:37.460]  same thing with the too big to fail banks getting our tax money general
[01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:41.100]  electric chairing the economic commission the White House getting a waiver
[01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:44.540]  for their power plants nobody else does as the government shuts down their
[01:02:44.540 --> 01:02:49.740]  competition Obama giving waivers to to thousands of big companies that give him
[01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:53.100]  money but they don't have to get insurance but we do for our employees I
[01:02:53.100 --> 01:02:58.300]  mean it is total mafia takeover that's what world government is is government
[01:02:58.300 --> 01:03:03.580]  by a corrupt corporate mafia who are waging war against the free market
[01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:09.340]  system this is so off the charts and to see the incredible expense of the
[01:03:09.340 --> 01:03:15.620]  militarized Swiss police you know going after the citizens like their scum the
[01:03:15.620 --> 01:03:19.060]  Swiss people are good folks and they have a good second amendment system that
[01:03:19.060 --> 01:03:24.740]  our second amendments based on and but but there you see it the same as every
[01:03:24.740 --> 01:03:27.620]  other country but Switzerland's a little bit different they are one of the main
[01:03:27.620 --> 01:03:32.260]  hoarding zones of these criminals money that's why the criminals haven't forced
[01:03:32.260 --> 01:03:36.220]  Switzerland into the EU yet and haven't forced into globalism yet because they
[01:03:36.220 --> 01:03:39.740]  want a place to hide out so there they are where they take much of their stolen
[01:03:39.740 --> 01:03:45.540]  loot these individuals many of them make billions a year through these brokerage
[01:03:45.540 --> 01:03:49.500]  firms and banks they steal from us on record and they haul it back to
[01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:53.660]  Switzerland and here are the globalists protecting them so you know why I didn't
[01:03:53.660 --> 01:03:56.340]  announce that Aaron Dykes and Paul Watson were gonna be on the ground I
[01:03:56.340 --> 01:04:02.580]  wanted them that was even guarded here in the office I have real trouble keeping
[01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:06.260]  things secret that's why I said we're gonna have our guys reporting on the
[01:04:06.260 --> 01:04:10.380]  reporters that are gonna be there Aaron Dykes and Paul Watson and my wife heard
[01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:14.620]  it and basically took it that they would be there a few days ago so I just
[01:04:14.620 --> 01:04:23.980]  really can't even lie when I try folks but the point is this is big news and
[01:04:23.980 --> 01:04:27.140]  we're fighting back and if we can get the world to awaken to these people
[01:04:27.140 --> 01:04:32.340]  there's a reason the controlled globalist dinosaur media doesn't want you to
[01:04:32.340 --> 01:04:35.340]  know they're there one of the other agendas last year and importantly this
[01:04:35.340 --> 01:04:39.180]  year is how to take over the internet how to shut down free speech because they
[01:04:39.180 --> 01:04:42.980]  can't have us identifying them as the criminals that have done it if we can
[01:04:42.980 --> 01:04:45.740]  identify these people to the general public remember just a four or five
[01:04:45.740 --> 01:04:49.020]  years ago it didn't exist the media would make fun of you for this just three
[01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:52.980]  years ago the New York Times said I was crazy and didn't cover Bilderberg
[01:04:52.980 --> 01:04:57.260]  okay because they're desperate to keep this information from you they're
[01:04:57.260 --> 01:05:02.420]  desperate Gerald Salenzay coming up this is Alex Jones with five good reasons

[01:05:22.980 --> 01:05:27.740]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[01:05:27.740 --> 01:05:31.500]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to

[01:09:10.860 --> 01:09:15.380]  codified into articles we're streaming live video of the guys driving around the
[01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:19.980]  Bilderberg group hotel where the global crime syndicate is meeting in St.
[01:09:19.980 --> 01:09:26.540]  Mort's the police did detain for 40 minutes Luke Radowski and our tea
[01:09:26.540 --> 01:09:30.460]  reporter and took his passport and threatened to arrest him and interrogated
[01:09:30.460 --> 01:09:34.780]  him so that's big news that we're gonna get curtain in mode to get a blurb out
[01:09:34.780 --> 01:09:40.340]  on we're gonna do coming up at the bottom of the hour we have done this in a
[01:09:40.340 --> 01:09:44.340]  month a Google bomb but I need to get an article out with it in the headline
[01:09:44.340 --> 01:09:49.180]  before I choose the term start your engines collectively to rush the
[01:09:49.180 --> 01:09:53.460]  globalist we've got that happening but but a lot of the people attending this
[01:09:53.460 --> 01:09:57.940]  have indictments out on them like Henry Kissinger in France and one of the top
[01:09:57.940 --> 01:10:01.780]  members of their government the equivalent of their Congress it was in
[01:10:01.780 --> 01:10:05.820]  Swiss news Monday drudge picked up our article on it called for the arrest of
[01:10:05.820 --> 01:10:09.940]  Henry Kissinger for the convictions he has in some countries for war crimes and
[01:10:09.940 --> 01:10:16.060]  the French indictment of this year George Soros can't go because of all the
[01:10:16.060 --> 01:10:21.100]  indictments and convictions in Europe on him I mean this is a mafia this is
[01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:25.720]  people think of the mafia some Italians sitting around in a farmhouse that's a
[01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:30.340]  low-level mafia okay this is the Dutch royalty the British royalty the Rothschilds
[01:10:30.340 --> 01:10:34.220]  the Rockefellers these are the people that Obama is calling for hundreds of
[01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:39.020]  billions more of US taxpayer money to quote bailout Greece but it's admitted
[01:10:39.020 --> 01:10:43.980]  in Greece and in Europe 91% of it is not owed by the Greek people their pension
[01:10:43.980 --> 01:10:48.580]  funds are tied in to the investments Goldman Sachs and others who took over
[01:10:48.580 --> 01:10:52.260]  their government two years ago set them up to fall now they're taking the
[01:10:52.260 --> 01:10:56.300]  country over some brokerage heads one guy who's owed three billion is getting
[01:10:56.300 --> 01:11:02.860]  huge islands individually from the government he sells them fraud controls
[01:11:02.860 --> 01:11:07.020]  their government pop and dry off and then has them handed all over to them
[01:11:07.020 --> 01:11:09.980]  that's how evil these people are they're the ones that want global
[01:11:09.980 --> 01:11:13.860]  population reduction they're the ones that want all of this they're the people
[01:11:13.860 --> 01:11:17.220]  that admittedly want to shut down the free press and openly we've gotten their
[01:11:17.220 --> 01:11:20.300]  documents where they want it they're the ones that want a global government and
[01:11:20.300 --> 01:11:24.300]  our people are covering it there right now in Switzerland we'll have
[01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:30.260]  continual coverage of that at info wars.com and prisonplanet.com now for
[01:11:30.260 --> 01:11:34.700]  the rest of the hour we're joined by the premier friends forecaster Gerald
[01:11:34.700 --> 01:11:38.820]  Salente he said last year that by the end of the year would be evident that the
[01:11:38.820 --> 01:11:42.420]  dollar was dying that we were in a depression well then the the media did
[01:11:42.420 --> 01:11:46.020]  admit there was a depression they said oh Gerald's wrong but look at the London
[01:11:46.020 --> 01:11:49.900]  independent analysis the London Guardian the Associated Press all the news this
[01:11:49.900 --> 01:11:53.980]  week says we're worse than depression level housing slump worse than
[01:11:53.980 --> 01:11:58.860]  depression level job losses they've been cooking the numbers there never was a
[01:11:58.860 --> 01:12:04.700]  recovery so the hoax is breaking Gerald Salente was right he wasn't wrong the
[01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:08.340]  Arabs are saying they're not going to increase output of oil all of that is
[01:12:08.340 --> 01:12:11.940]  happening we've got a lot of intel from inside the Bilderberg group I'll go over
[01:12:11.940 --> 01:12:15.620]  later in the hour what's on their agenda bigger war in the Middle East as a
[01:12:15.620 --> 01:12:20.660]  political distraction who they're going to replace at the IMF so much key
[01:12:20.660 --> 01:12:24.940]  information but it's happening and these are the people that have done it by
[01:12:24.940 --> 01:12:29.620]  design joining us is Gerald Salente via video Skype thank you for joining us
[01:12:29.620 --> 01:12:39.580]  Gerald and his audio cut out we'll go to him video Skypes great for the prison
[01:12:39.580 --> 01:12:43.100]  planet TV viewers and the audio quality is better that's why we do it but
[01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:46.860]  sometimes the technology can be a bit jumpy obviously as you've seen from our
[01:12:46.860 --> 01:12:52.780]  folks reporting but what's great we have Gerald Salente with us Gerald here are
[01:12:52.780 --> 01:12:58.660]  the global crime syndicate white shoe boys as you call them meeting openly
[01:12:58.660 --> 01:13:02.420]  most of them the heads of the banks that are looting us and the police are
[01:13:02.420 --> 01:13:06.340]  treating reporters like scum and threatening to arrest them and snatching
[01:13:06.340 --> 01:13:12.460]  their passports from them Gerald Salente well you know what I used to say over
[01:13:12.460 --> 01:13:16.620]  and over again and people didn't want to hear it if the names on Wall Street
[01:13:16.620 --> 01:13:22.780]  were named Salente Caruso Mondavi Buccini Rossini they call it the mafia but as
[01:13:22.780 --> 01:13:26.820]  you point out you can't call the white shoe boys crooks and criminals oh no
[01:13:26.820 --> 01:13:31.380]  they dress nice and they have good language and they go to Harvard Princeton
[01:13:31.380 --> 01:13:37.100]  Yale and ox or Neaton boys oh no they're they're proper you know they're they're
[01:13:37.100 --> 01:13:42.420]  raping this country international monetary fund you know if if Dominique
[01:13:42.420 --> 01:13:48.940]  Strauss Khan is allegedly guilty of raping that woman it's just what the
[01:13:48.940 --> 01:13:54.900]  IMF does they're either raping a person or raping a country you pointed it out
[01:13:54.900 --> 01:14:01.780]  they call it privatization they what they do is they force countries into
[01:14:01.780 --> 01:14:06.940]  bankruptcy by their banking deals and as you also pointed out who do the
[01:14:06.940 --> 01:14:11.140]  Greek people owe this money to oh the German and French banks and other
[01:14:11.140 --> 01:14:16.180]  criminal groups that made bad bets and they can't lose so what are they doing
[01:14:16.180 --> 01:14:22.260]  well we have to privatize privatize oh again white shoe boy language that means
[01:14:22.260 --> 01:14:28.980]  taking expensive public resources and selling them very cheaply to your
[01:14:28.980 --> 01:14:36.300]  buddies so what we're looking at here Alex is really criminal activity that's
[01:14:36.300 --> 01:14:42.020]  in front of all of us and you nailed it what you're doing is terrific by
[01:14:42.020 --> 01:14:47.060]  exposing it and as you well point out I remember 20 years ago there was this
[01:14:47.060 --> 01:14:50.460]  little newspaper I think was called Liberty Lobby and they used to write
[01:14:50.460 --> 01:14:54.220]  about the Build-A-Birds and nobody believed them nobody oh they would they
[01:14:54.220 --> 01:15:00.020]  were these crazy people the takeover has happened and it's not socialism I make
[01:15:00.020 --> 01:15:06.660]  this really clear the merger of state and corporate powers is called fascism
[01:15:06.660 --> 01:15:11.580]  and all the police are the ones that you are talking about the police in the
[01:15:11.580 --> 01:15:18.220]  in the countries around the world are nothing more than enforcers for the
[01:15:18.220 --> 01:15:25.380]  government crime bosses the morality of the police is disgusting is what's
[01:15:25.380 --> 01:15:30.340]  happened as you pointed out that video about breaking down the door at six
[01:15:30.340 --> 01:15:34.420]  o'clock in the morning because the guy didn't pay his wife didn't pay his
[01:15:34.420 --> 01:15:40.500]  student loan one after another so the people better stand up because boy oh
[01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:46.740]  boy the steamroller is ready to roll and they're gonna roll you over
[01:15:46.740 --> 01:15:51.420]  Gerald for those that don't know the footage is up at info wars.com and
[01:15:51.420 --> 01:15:56.380]  prismplanet.com the Department of Education the feds of visually
[01:15:56.380 --> 01:16:00.780]  federalized local police they just show up and order them the SWAT team someone
[01:16:00.780 --> 01:16:04.740]  when debtor prisons are illegal but I see articles every day where they're
[01:16:04.740 --> 01:16:09.620]  arresting people for unpaid debts and and and then I see the article where the
[01:16:09.620 --> 01:16:14.180]  police did do their job in Florida where for five months the bank said you
[01:16:14.180 --> 01:16:18.500]  never owned the house the people paid cash Bank of America you don't have a
[01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:23.500]  deed you took their luxury home and finally the police did the right thing
[01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:27.500]  and did their job and when they went into the bank to seize the Bank of America
[01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:30.900]  branch and take the money out of the bank to pay them their hundreds of
[01:16:30.900 --> 01:16:36.420]  thousands back under court order the banker reportedly said well you can't
[01:16:36.420 --> 01:16:40.260]  do this we're Bank of America these guys think and they've committed so many
[01:16:40.260 --> 01:16:45.180]  crimes that they're God and can do this but their comeuppance is coming the
[01:16:45.180 --> 01:16:49.620]  awakening is happening to these criminals and Bank of America is part of
[01:16:49.620 --> 01:16:53.860]  the big global six mega banks that own the IMF and World Bank and that own the
[01:16:53.860 --> 01:16:58.220]  Federal Reserve shares and the people are identifying them and the people are
[01:16:58.220 --> 01:17:04.140]  awakening well they better awake you know I just heard James Carville the
[01:17:04.140 --> 01:17:10.660]  Democratic strategist and he's now saying what I said two years ago was going
[01:17:10.660 --> 01:17:14.460]  to happen but of course now it's making news and they're not calling him crazy
[01:17:14.460 --> 01:17:19.980]  and I'm going to settle on rest exactly you know I've been saying this for how
[01:17:19.980 --> 01:17:24.860]  long and that's what's going to happen you know I just I hear it's very simple
[01:17:24.860 --> 01:17:29.260]  yeah I've been giving this a lot of thought the only way this is going to
[01:17:29.260 --> 01:17:34.020]  change we're not going to have a third party it's rigged against us let the
[01:17:34.020 --> 01:17:43.220]  people vote let the people vote every major issue war bailouts immigration let
[01:17:43.220 --> 01:17:47.020]  the people vote you talked about Switzerland what do they have in
[01:17:47.020 --> 01:17:51.820]  Switzerland other than the money cockroaches what they have in Switzerland
[01:17:51.820 --> 01:17:57.260]  is direct democracy the representatives in this country don't represent us
[01:17:57.260 --> 01:18:03.820]  let's make this really clear what they call campaign contributions you know
[01:18:03.820 --> 01:18:11.340]  that's kitty talk for bribes and payoffs let the people vote let the people vote
[01:18:11.340 --> 01:18:16.980]  on every issue we do not have a representative form of government it's
[01:18:16.980 --> 01:18:22.740]  a takeover Washington is controlled by Wall Street the only way I see it
[01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:27.660]  changing Alex if you go back to talk the people would have never voted for it if
[01:18:27.660 --> 01:18:32.260]  you put the war on Libyan front of the people they would never vote for it if
[01:18:32.260 --> 01:18:37.180]  you put up do you want to keep the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan going the
[01:18:37.180 --> 01:18:41.700]  people won't vote for it that's the only way I see out of this a direct
[01:18:41.700 --> 01:18:49.620]  democracy on major issues well you're absolutely right and in every case in
[01:18:49.620 --> 01:18:53.500]  history tyrants undoing is that they they reach too far they get away with
[01:18:53.500 --> 01:18:57.860]  so much that they think they can do whatever they want it's like wiener I
[01:18:57.860 --> 01:19:01.980]  mean what type of person their right mind especially a prominent person would
[01:19:01.980 --> 01:19:07.420]  be sending hundreds of photos of their member out to women and then when
[01:19:07.420 --> 01:19:16.060]  Andrew Brett Bart comes out and reports on it they say he hacked wiener and put
[01:19:16.060 --> 01:19:21.380]  it out wiener knew that wasn't true I mean this is incredible how not only did
[01:19:21.380 --> 01:19:28.260]  he lie about it he tried to frame Andrew Brett Bart I mean these guys but
[01:19:28.260 --> 01:19:34.420]  Alex Alex who does his wife work for Hillary and don't you remember the
[01:19:34.420 --> 01:19:39.220]  Bill's story well she's a special while Bill said Hillary up the monocle of

[01:24:21.580 --> 01:24:27.700]  is our guest up on our Twitter feed that you can follow at info wars.com we
[01:24:27.700 --> 01:24:38.180]  have a big headline area there that says exclusive continually updated area at
[01:24:38.180 --> 01:24:41.780]  info wars.com we're also going to get the special page posted up at
[01:24:41.780 --> 01:24:47.700]  prisonplanet.com it has links to our live video feeds photo feeds and so much
[01:24:47.700 --> 01:24:53.540]  more but we now have the blown-up photos of the concentration camp style
[01:24:53.540 --> 01:25:01.380]  floodlights the special pod tripods with cameras every 10-15 feet or so that's
[01:25:01.380 --> 01:25:08.340]  all up there right now and we do have from Jim Tucker this is breaking here
[01:25:08.340 --> 01:25:12.740]  what their agenda is and I'll talk a little bit about that in the next segment
[01:25:12.740 --> 01:25:17.060]  let's just get into it now what do you think of this agenda directly from his
[01:25:17.060 --> 01:25:21.700]  multiple sources inside Bilderberg and we also have the intel a trust but
[01:25:21.700 --> 01:25:25.220]  verify confirming that the West is behind trying to trigger a lot of these
[01:25:25.220 --> 01:25:29.780]  Arab uprisings to drive up oil prices start a larger regional war as you said
[01:25:29.780 --> 01:25:33.380]  a year ago they would try to trigger a war as a political smoke screen so we'd
[01:25:33.380 --> 01:25:37.460]  rally around them that they're upset that Congress is starting to wake up to the
[01:25:37.460 --> 01:25:40.540]  fact that Obama didn't have congressional approval and used you in
[01:25:40.540 --> 01:25:45.220]  authority to do it they want a wider giant war in the Middle East this is
[01:25:45.220 --> 01:25:51.580]  directly from inside they want continued bailouts not just agrees but they want
[01:25:51.580 --> 01:25:55.340]  to secure unlimited trillions in a second round of profiteering that they
[01:25:55.340 --> 01:25:59.900]  call bailouts so that's being haggled over there they're picking the new IMF
[01:25:59.900 --> 01:26:04.820]  had even Swiss press has reported that but this is all very newsworthy here but
[01:26:04.820 --> 01:26:08.740]  oh you won't see it in the US other than info wars.com and prisonplanet.com we
[01:26:08.740 --> 01:26:12.540]  hope the drugs report picks all this up as it develops also they want to go
[01:26:12.540 --> 01:26:17.500]  after the alternative media and we see inside mirrored by public Sarkozy and
[01:26:17.500 --> 01:26:23.860]  others two weeks ago at the EU meeting Gerald openly saying that they do want
[01:26:23.860 --> 01:26:27.300]  to clamp down on freedom of the press and the web and start censoring people
[01:26:27.300 --> 01:26:33.180]  and taxing the web this is this is big news and they're trying to get their
[01:26:33.180 --> 01:26:36.780]  carbon tax through all that from inside Bilderberg what's your take on that
[01:26:36.780 --> 01:26:42.060]  agenda well it's the agenda that's been going on now for quite some time first
[01:26:42.060 --> 01:26:46.700]  of all let's look at the they have to continue to print the digital money not
[01:26:46.700 --> 01:26:51.740]  worth the paper it's not printed on so that's why we still believe gold 2000
[01:26:51.740 --> 01:26:57.300]  and above you saw the unemployment numbers last week worse than expected and
[01:26:57.300 --> 01:27:02.420]  I love the language again the white shoe boy language that economists are
[01:27:02.420 --> 01:27:07.740]  downgrading their forecast downgrading you mean they got it wrong
[01:27:07.740 --> 01:27:12.860]  no no they downgrade when we get something wrong well then it's wrong but
[01:27:12.860 --> 01:27:18.540]  not them and then let's keep going on here Alex they've already historically
[01:27:18.540 --> 01:27:24.140]  engineered the first great war of the 21st century that we said was going to
[01:27:24.140 --> 01:27:30.220]  begin and has begun now they're calling it I love it pro democracy movements
[01:27:30.220 --> 01:27:36.180]  pro democracy movements this has nothing to do about democracy it has to do
[01:27:36.180 --> 01:27:43.020]  with a lot of angry people a lot of angry angry Greeks a lot of angry Tunisians
[01:27:43.020 --> 01:27:49.300]  and Egyptians a lot of angry Bahrain's and from Yemen and what's the same
[01:27:49.300 --> 01:27:58.700]  story young people Spain 50 45 50 percent unemployment with university
[01:27:58.700 --> 01:28:05.340]  degrees and worthlessness no future in front of them and the past has been
[01:28:05.340 --> 01:28:12.940]  stolen and continues to be stolen by the corrupt few at the top the Goldman
[01:28:12.940 --> 01:28:21.780]  Sachs gang the credit Suisse boys the Deutsche Bank bandits one criminal group
[01:28:21.780 --> 01:28:28.620]  after another how about that lovely lovely guy Steve Schwarzman that's
[01:28:28.620 --> 01:28:36.140]  bringing down the health care system as we speak right now in England Steve
[01:28:36.140 --> 01:28:43.380]  Schwarzman oh the CEO of the Blackstone group who when they were going to raise
[01:28:43.380 --> 01:28:52.220]  the tax rate for hedge funds he said quote it's the equivalent of Adolf Hitler
[01:28:52.220 --> 01:29:00.460]  invading Poland in 1939 these are the people that are robbing us blind so what
[01:29:00.460 --> 01:29:04.780]  they're saying it's a pro-democracy movement this has nothing to do with
[01:29:04.780 --> 01:29:10.180]  democracy more of angry people they knew that the tree was about to fall on
[01:29:10.180 --> 01:29:13.820]  their house in the Middle East so they decided to put a chain on it pull up the
[01:29:13.820 --> 01:29:20.460]  other direction and start the cutting in a controlled burn in Libya in Egypt in
[01:29:20.460 --> 01:29:24.740]  all these countries it it's admitted that the State Department CIA MI6
[01:29:24.740 --> 01:29:30.380]  Mossad did run it and they're putting even worse military dictators in is
[01:29:30.380 --> 01:29:33.900]  what they've now done totally banning protest in Egypt and the folks are
[01:29:33.900 --> 01:29:38.460]  still rebelling but now Anderson Cooper isn't covering it and hailing it so the
[01:29:38.460 --> 01:29:43.100]  Bilderberg boys want a wide collapse in the Middle East to drive up oil prices
[01:29:43.100 --> 01:29:46.780]  to further bankrupt the general population hurt Nemo's got this key

[01:38:45.140 --> 01:38:48.820]  they're setting up the next level of implosion and then they'll come back and
[01:38:48.820 --> 01:38:52.660]  say give us even more power and and we'll save you but it only gets worse
[01:38:52.660 --> 01:38:56.260]  this is how third world countries became third world countries so again keep

[01:39:02.700 --> 01:39:06.540]  what do you think of the idea I thought I'm gonna tweet it you can count on me
[01:39:06.540 --> 01:39:12.060]  I'll keep get keep it going anything absolutely but again what the people
[01:39:12.060 --> 01:39:16.380]  have to do is they really have to understand that they must stand up I
[01:39:16.380 --> 01:39:21.740]  just got back from Ireland and and I was a bit disheartened I have to say what
[01:39:21.740 --> 01:39:27.260]  happened to those fighting Irish they're rolling over the government is now
[01:39:27.260 --> 01:39:34.180]  putting water taxes on them or property taxes to bail out the banks and and it's
[01:39:34.180 --> 01:39:43.140]  very simple I said to them take one letter and change it Iceland Ireland put
[01:39:43.140 --> 01:39:50.540]  that sea in Ireland don't pay the banks screw the bankers that's all you have to
[01:39:50.540 --> 01:39:57.180]  do you look at every nation that has shoved it back to the IMF and their
[01:39:57.180 --> 01:40:03.900]  all doing better the IMF is nothing more than a crime syndicate as I said it's
[01:40:03.900 --> 01:40:09.300]  the international mafia federated we got their IMF World Bank documents in 2002
[01:40:09.300 --> 01:40:13.460]  when sticklets left they got leaked BBC it was how they go in how they buy off
[01:40:13.460 --> 01:40:17.100]  the politicians how they get the finance ministers in how they have them buy
[01:40:17.100 --> 01:40:21.100]  these investments then they implode it then the economy implodes then riots
[01:40:21.100 --> 01:40:26.380]  start they call the IMF riot then that destroys credibility even more the
[01:40:26.380 --> 01:40:30.300]  stocks go down they come in and buy them up for pennies on the dollar we have them
[01:40:30.300 --> 01:40:34.540]  they should all be arrested and we have good Swiss ministers calling for their
[01:40:34.540 --> 01:40:40.380]  arrest so the Swiss people high noon Saturday need to be there Gerald yes
[01:40:40.380 --> 01:40:46.380]  and and going back and tying this all together Alex let's not forget just a
[01:40:46.380 --> 01:40:52.540]  month ago don't you feel a lot better now that Osama bin Laden you know that
[01:40:52.540 --> 01:40:59.540]  fairy tale they told us life is great after that that fairy tale happened but
[01:40:59.540 --> 01:41:06.420]  today just listen to the chief of NATO the NATO chief we need quote wider
[01:41:06.420 --> 01:41:12.580]  participation in Libya wider participation this is a psychopath
[01:41:12.580 --> 01:41:20.700]  talking he calls wanton murder wider participation they call the war kinetic
[01:41:20.700 --> 01:41:25.700]  action and it's gonna last days Obama said he promised and he didn't need
[01:41:25.700 --> 01:41:29.780]  Congress's approval he said I have you in approval and I went to the UN to
[01:41:29.780 --> 01:41:34.740]  increase its quote credibility it's treason I don't just use that word it's
[01:41:34.740 --> 01:41:41.500]  naked in our face elephants sitting on us the elephants not in the room it's
[01:41:41.500 --> 01:41:46.900]  sitting on us and I want out of the elephants rear end well listen that's
[01:41:46.900 --> 01:41:51.580]  the point that I'm trying to make is exactly that because what they're
[01:41:51.580 --> 01:41:57.500]  going to do by the time election day comes and the economy is in much worse
[01:41:57.500 --> 01:42:06.420]  shape than it is now count on a terror strike more war you saw how effectively
[01:42:06.420 --> 01:42:18.180]  that terror band wagon rolls go back four days April 27th before before Osama or
[01:42:18.180 --> 01:42:25.500]  Barack Osama Obama well whoever before he hit the stage and said our core
[01:42:25.500 --> 01:42:30.860]  interests in those of our allies are at stake so I'm going to war against Libya
[01:42:30.860 --> 01:42:38.340]  go back four days before Osama Ben Bernanke public enemy number one gave the
[01:42:38.340 --> 01:42:44.860]  first-ever press conference of the Federal Reserve by the time he finished
[01:42:44.860 --> 01:42:53.860]  his dog and pony show gold prices shot up $20 an ounce silver spiked the
[01:42:53.860 --> 01:42:59.180]  dollar hit a three-year low against a trade-weighted basket occurrence nobody
[01:42:59.180 --> 01:43:06.740]  buys with these crooks say anymore but what happened four days later when Osama
[01:43:06.740 --> 01:43:12.700]  was back in the news hey we fitted him with these cement shoes and now he's
[01:43:12.700 --> 01:43:18.460]  swimming with the fishes I mean who could believe this story commodity price
[01:43:18.460 --> 01:43:29.700]  is doled gold fell from 1570s down to around 1500 the power of Osama Barack
[01:43:29.700 --> 01:43:35.980]  Osama who's saying whatever his name is whatever is passed it was a it was
[01:43:35.980 --> 01:43:40.220]  irrational exuberance high five and we want everything's fine meanwhile the
[01:43:40.220 --> 01:43:44.500]  bankers are just stealing everything setting up mafia deals where oh you
[01:43:44.500 --> 01:43:48.180]  don't have to get insurance if you're an Obama insider your company doesn't know
[01:43:48.180 --> 01:43:52.140]  your GE you can build more power plants you get a waiver I mean everything they
[01:43:52.140 --> 01:43:57.660]  do is total mafia right out of the classic book but oh we were taught like
[01:43:57.660 --> 01:44:03.100]  you said that archetype only Italians are involved in organized crime not the
[01:44:03.100 --> 01:44:10.020]  blank finds not the bushes no not the Dominic Strauss cons only only those
[01:44:10.020 --> 01:44:14.580]  Italians know anybody else every anybody who's old with a bald head in a suit
[01:44:14.580 --> 01:44:18.940]  you got a fall down open your wrist up to him give him all your money give him
[01:44:18.940 --> 01:44:24.500]  your whole future they now admit the average household owes what I saw a
[01:44:24.500 --> 01:44:28.020]  number like five yeah five hundred and twenty seven thousand here's USA Today
[01:44:28.020 --> 01:44:34.780]  per household just on one part of unfunded future promises so it isn't
[01:44:34.780 --> 01:44:38.500]  14 something trillion it's in the hundreds and hundreds of trillions we
[01:44:38.500 --> 01:44:42.940]  could have already paid all this off but they have signed us on to the fiat
[01:44:42.940 --> 01:44:50.740]  Ponzi rat droppings that Bernanke and and and Paulson and before him green
[01:44:50.740 --> 01:44:55.060]  span and the end of Glass-Steagall these droppings they left and then they make
[01:44:55.060 --> 01:45:00.580]  us pay to literally eat their droppings and they tell us that it's the finest
[01:45:00.580 --> 01:45:06.100]  filet mignon when it's a steaming pile of horse done America the world the
[01:45:06.100 --> 01:45:11.540]  Swiss these are the criminals they're not going to stop I'm sorry Gerald well
[01:45:11.540 --> 01:45:16.140]  that's it but then that's very important because what I'm saying is by the time
[01:45:16.140 --> 01:45:22.300]  the elections come in 2012 the people are going to be cheering on they're going
[01:45:22.300 --> 01:45:27.780]  to whether it's a false flag which most likely or something real because the
[01:45:27.780 --> 01:45:32.700]  United States keeps starting wars all over the world the mind won't be on the
[01:45:32.700 --> 01:45:38.660]  economy they're gonna do a bush and and I can see it happening the first great
[01:45:38.660 --> 01:45:45.140]  war of the 21st century has begun look what's not making the news Albania is
[01:45:45.140 --> 01:45:49.660]  starting war over there again the people are fed up with the criminal system
[01:45:49.660 --> 01:45:56.380]  you're gonna see in Romania Bulgaria Latvia Lithuania Hungary the spring the
[01:45:56.380 --> 01:46:03.100]  Arabs spring that they call now we're going to see a European summer and get
[01:46:03.100 --> 01:46:09.260]  ready for a world winter they're leading us to war they're gonna divert our
[01:46:09.260 --> 01:46:16.220]  attention listen to Bernie Madoff the king of Ponzi he did an interview in
[01:46:16.220 --> 01:46:22.020]  New York magazine over the telephone and he said two things he said when I got
[01:46:22.020 --> 01:46:27.340]  into Wall Street I realized you had to be a member of the club and the game is
[01:46:27.340 --> 01:46:35.700]  rigged number two he said it's nothing more than one big Ponzi scheme this is
[01:46:35.700 --> 01:46:41.980]  coming from the king of Ponzi it's a Ponzi scheme they're suckering in the
[01:46:41.980 --> 01:46:48.620]  people by shoving that money out there to keep the scam going it's going to
[01:46:48.620 --> 01:46:55.900]  collapse but our minds will be off it Alex the timeline the crash at 29 the

[01:47:01.980 --> 01:47:09.780]  which is a depression currency wars trade wars world war two in the 30s the
[01:47:09.780 --> 01:47:19.940]  first great war of the 21st century in 2012 and beyond it's incredible and now
[01:47:19.940 --> 01:47:23.340]  they're announcing and they said they do this years ago I've laid it all out for
[01:47:23.340 --> 01:47:27.540]  listeners explained it first they take the belt off take the shoes off take the
[01:47:27.540 --> 01:47:30.500]  jacket off now we're gonna touch the outside of your pants now we're gonna

[01:47:50.740 --> 01:47:54.660]  want to just extra judicially because the FBI has the next system not a law
[01:47:54.660 --> 01:47:58.660]  they just say oh you can't have a gun but I don't even have a misdemeanor we
[01:47:58.660 --> 01:48:03.340]  say well why do you say well we say so if you're on the list you go to the full
[01:48:03.340 --> 01:48:08.380]  grope down the body scan the interrogation normal you just go through a
[01:48:08.380 --> 01:48:13.220]  body scan but if you're a good little slave you walk through and retina scan
[01:48:13.220 --> 01:48:17.940]  your retina if you've enrolled and gotten permission from them to just have
[01:48:17.940 --> 01:48:22.580]  to retina scan but they said sometimes we're still gonna grope you anyway so

[01:49:37.220 --> 01:49:43.340]  mean it's so clear they make it up they use it it's all theater Gerald Alex you
[01:49:43.340 --> 01:49:48.820]  talked about martial law I'm urging everyone to consider economic martial
[01:49:48.820 --> 01:49:53.620]  law because that's what's going to happen next just as 9-11 happened whether
[01:49:53.620 --> 01:49:57.620]  or not it was real or whatever the fact is two buildings came down and the
[01:49:57.620 --> 01:50:02.660]  Pentagon was whacked how it happened forget it the issue is they closed Wall
[01:50:02.660 --> 01:50:06.540]  Street if you had certificates of deposit you couldn't cash them in I know
[01:50:06.540 --> 01:50:14.700]  because I tried what I'm doing and only speaking for myself I urge those that
[01:50:14.700 --> 01:50:20.260]  can think for themselves to consider making sure you don't have a lot of
[01:50:20.260 --> 01:50:24.500]  money in the bank because you ain't gonna get it out and if you have your gold
[01:50:24.500 --> 01:50:30.500]  store there or somewhere else in one of those federal institutions kiss it
[01:50:30.500 --> 01:50:35.660]  goodbye and if they do get you let you get your money out that dollar won't be
[01:50:35.660 --> 01:50:39.620]  worth a dime it's hardly worth a dime now look what it's doing against the
[01:50:39.620 --> 01:50:44.540]  basket of currencies because they're going to devalue it and don't worry you
[01:50:44.540 --> 01:50:48.620]  won't be able to get it out at all Gerald stay there stay there this is key

[01:54:25.540 --> 01:54:27.940]  us I didn't even ask him during the break he's probably got to go here at the
[01:54:27.940 --> 01:54:32.300]  one-minute break if he wants to go five minutes in the next hour he can so much
[01:54:32.300 --> 01:54:36.860]  happening Gerald what else is on your radar screen that we haven't talked
[01:54:36.860 --> 01:54:40.580]  about or discussed today I'd like to pick up what you were talking about with the
[01:54:40.580 --> 01:54:46.740]  TSA in groping and how people just submit I just flew out of Newark and I
[01:54:46.740 --> 01:54:50.660]  wouldn't go through the x-ray machine so I opted out but as I'm waiting online
[01:54:50.660 --> 01:54:55.820]  I'm watching the sheep will go through and and I was thinking to myself they
[01:54:55.820 --> 01:54:58.980]  could have the they could have the freight train on the other side of the
[01:54:58.980 --> 01:55:03.620]  door and they would just get in and take them off to the FEMA camps and they
[01:55:03.620 --> 01:55:09.020]  wouldn't say a peep and I have to say how discouraged I am at the lack of
[01:55:09.020 --> 01:55:13.340]  courage that people have and then you know going through the whole routine I
[01:55:13.340 --> 01:55:17.780]  mean I mean come on you know I would stop with this terrorist stuff yeah I
[01:55:17.780 --> 01:55:21.260]  look like the kind of guy that's gonna blow the plane up and if I wanted to
[01:55:21.260 --> 01:55:26.500]  blow something up I mean I have to get on a plane to do it you know so this is
[01:55:26.500 --> 01:55:32.500]  all a scam but I have to tell you how discouraged I am to see the people so
[01:55:32.500 --> 01:55:38.300]  willfully submit and they're going to continue to willfully submit just as
[01:55:38.300 --> 01:55:45.740]  they did as they all applauded Osama Obama Barack Hussein whatever his name is
[01:55:45.740 --> 01:55:49.900]  by the way whenever terrorist Al Cida blows up a World Trade Center or
[01:55:49.900 --> 01:55:53.780]  something like that I've gone out and now people are buying steaks beer it's
[01:55:53.780 --> 01:55:58.540]  fun to watch the people dying and to feel hurt and get upset that's how
[01:55:58.540 --> 01:56:02.100]  decadent a large portion of the population is they didn't get scared
[01:56:02.100 --> 01:56:06.220]  they got excited like it was a spectacle and then it's fun to give your
[01:56:06.220 --> 01:56:10.220]  rights up and oh then the government anthrax gets mailed and it's fun to get
[01:56:10.220 --> 01:56:14.660]  scared of that but that's a group that's gonna suck their thumbs there's a
[01:56:14.660 --> 01:56:17.900]  growing group a minority but it's approaching a majority that is not
[01:56:17.900 --> 01:56:21.220]  gonna be slaves and that's what the globalists need to understand they're
[01:56:21.220 --> 01:56:25.100]  not gonna be able to beat us and we're identifying them and we're not going into
[01:56:25.100 --> 01:56:30.020]  this long night we are going to stop their world government takeover that's
[01:56:30.020 --> 01:56:34.460]  right and you know I remember being on your show recently when Fukushima broke
[01:56:34.460 --> 01:56:39.020]  out and you and I were adamant about it that you were showing the footage of
[01:56:39.020 --> 01:56:44.820]  this thing blowing up and we're saying no this is a meltdown and how they lie
[01:56:44.820 --> 01:56:53.100]  how they lied and they keep lying and the people it's out of the news nobody's
[01:56:53.100 --> 01:56:57.300]  talking about was a conspiracy theory when it that people were saying that
[01:56:57.300 --> 01:57:02.020]  they had meltdown now they admit three total meltdowns including a plutonium
[01:57:02.020 --> 01:57:07.140]  reactor blowing rods three thousand feet in the sky at least ten times worse
[01:57:07.140 --> 01:57:12.060]  now total and we had scientists on who had the meters and said isotopes are
[01:57:12.060 --> 01:57:17.380]  being released that are only released in beyond meltdown actual many nuclear
[01:57:17.380 --> 01:57:23.860]  explosions Gerald and and and it's incredible they knew the whole time they
[01:57:23.860 --> 01:57:29.700]  knew the whole time and they're lying to us every day every minute and I listen
[01:57:29.700 --> 01:57:33.300]  to these Republicans you know I'm a political atheist I don't believe in
[01:57:33.300 --> 01:57:38.220]  either of these mafia parties and I'm listening to them now about you know we
[01:57:38.220 --> 01:57:43.540]  have to cut back on the on the budget not one people about cutting the defense
[01:57:43.540 --> 01:57:48.980]  budget and what are they talking about we have to keep our guns zamed in
[01:57:48.980 --> 01:57:53.860]  Afghanistan and what are they going to do they're gonna bring in soldiers of the
[01:57:53.860 --> 01:57:59.900]  fortune 500 into Iraq they're pulling out the soldiers and then putting in the
[01:57:59.900 --> 01:58:06.020]  defense contractors defense contractors mercenaries and another thing Alex
[01:58:06.020 --> 01:58:11.060]  another trend that everybody should pay a lot of attention to and it ties in with

[02:01:27.980 --> 02:01:32.100]  from Switzerland at Bilderberg with Aaron Dykes and Paul Watson Gerald you were
[02:01:32.100 --> 02:01:36.460]  getting into the E. Coli and how they they keep blaming this organic food that
[02:01:36.460 --> 02:01:40.580]  organic food and moving down the line when it's clearly genetically engineered
[02:01:40.580 --> 02:01:44.180]  and they're going to use this to try to have government clamp down further on
[02:01:44.180 --> 02:01:49.540]  farms and ranches to help big agra Gerald Salente well that's it that's it
[02:01:49.540 --> 02:01:53.100]  you know that they control everything look that's Senate Bill 501 that they
[02:01:53.100 --> 02:01:57.380]  shoved through so what we're telling people is that when you really put all
[02:01:57.380 --> 02:02:02.660]  the pieces together the air the food the water you know you they're killing us
[02:02:02.660 --> 02:02:05.940]  in a hundred different ways you know by the way I don't know if you know this
[02:02:05.940 --> 02:02:09.860]  Alex I have an honorary doctorate from the National University of Health
[02:02:09.860 --> 02:02:14.580]  Sciences Health Sciences for the work I've done over the many years in

[02:02:38.660 --> 02:02:45.740]  radiations in the air the food system is being poisoned we don't have a shot and
[02:02:45.740 --> 02:02:51.660]  the only shot we do have is if we take it in our own hands and I want to talk
[02:02:51.660 --> 02:02:58.780]  also about your Midas resources and and and the importance for me in owning
[02:02:58.780 --> 02:03:05.460]  gold and silver current events form future trends look at these solar flares
[02:03:05.460 --> 02:03:11.660]  this isn't you know this isn't conspiracy theorist stuff this is NASA
[02:03:11.660 --> 02:03:15.820]  talking about it and there's going to be a lot more of them coming this year
[02:03:15.820 --> 02:03:21.740]  will you go back to the 1800s when they had telegraph and the Carrington event
[02:03:21.740 --> 02:03:27.020]  fried them they were out just think what they're gonna do to the internet and
[02:03:27.020 --> 02:03:35.020]  let's all understand there's no money out there it's all digital money but it
[02:03:35.020 --> 02:03:43.700]  won't fry gold it won't fry silver as it fries the electronic system and I see
[02:03:43.700 --> 02:03:50.420]  this guy from another planet this Steve Jobs talking about the wonders of cloud
[02:03:50.420 --> 02:03:56.820]  computing what cloud computing there's no clouds out there you're just putting
[02:03:56.820 --> 02:04:03.180]  your information on somebody else's server and if this happens the way a lot
[02:04:03.180 --> 02:04:09.780]  of scientists are saying you're gonna see a big meltdown a big frying system
[02:04:09.780 --> 02:04:13.740]  well they're engineering it admittedly where the devices won't allow you at
[02:04:13.740 --> 02:04:17.180]  first you just have certain stuff on the cloud but they admit not talk about
[02:04:17.180 --> 02:04:21.340]  this a decade ago and that's what internet 2 is you've got a domain on a
[02:04:21.340 --> 02:04:25.340]  bigger domain and have no rights like YouTube you've got your stuff on
[02:04:25.340 --> 02:04:29.060]  somebody else's system and you sign your rights away to agree and you're like
[02:04:29.060 --> 02:04:32.380]  well I'll just keep my stuff on my server the devices and they're getting
[02:04:32.380 --> 02:04:35.500]  together at Bilderberg that's why they get these guys together they're getting
[02:04:35.500 --> 02:04:40.020]  together to make it where the devices soon won't work with your own computer
[02:04:40.020 --> 02:04:43.820]  your own servers you'll have to be in their cloud Gerald I'm glad you brought
[02:04:43.820 --> 02:04:51.460]  that up more key trends straight ahead your phone calls 800 259 931 by the way
[02:04:51.460 --> 02:04:55.700]  well we got some breaking stuff for you I'll cover it when we get back and this
[02:04:55.700 --> 02:05:04.820]  is so amazing stay with us hi folks this is Alex Jones I don't want to tell you
[02:05:04.820 --> 02:05:09.140]  about the silver lungs generator now you can produce pure and endless colloidal
[02:05:09.140 --> 02:05:13.460]  silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing
[02:05:13.460 --> 02:05:17.380]  the solution through the lungs the respiratory system is the first line of
[02:05:17.380 --> 02:05:21.260]  defense for airborne pathogens and viruses the silver lungs generator
[02:05:21.260 --> 02:05:26.060]  infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano silver solutions
[02:05:26.060 --> 02:05:30.980]  and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream
[02:05:30.980 --> 02:05:35.940]  with continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products you can
[02:05:35.940 --> 02:05:40.620]  now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the silver lungs generator
[02:05:40.620 --> 02:05:44.720]  very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided making
[02:05:44.720 --> 02:05:51.100]  production fast and simple go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more
[02:05:51.100 --> 02:06:01.300]  about the breakthrough technology of the silver lungs generator that's www.silverlungs.com
[02:06:01.300 --> 02:06:06.100]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[02:06:06.100 --> 02:06:11.620]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that
[02:06:11.620 --> 02:06:15.340]  we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've turned members
[02:06:15.340 --> 02:06:20.380]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[02:06:20.380 --> 02:06:25.780]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[02:06:25.780 --> 02:06:30.700]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[02:06:30.700 --> 02:06:35.100]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[02:06:35.100 --> 02:06:38.820]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more
[02:06:38.820 --> 02:06:42.780]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[02:06:42.780 --> 02:06:48.300]  like nobody does care right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of
[02:06:48.300 --> 02:06:54.020]  the Republic get your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at info wars.com
[02:06:54.020 --> 02:07:00.620]  we're watching online right now in super high quality at prison planet TV this
[02:07:00.620 --> 02:07:04.140]  is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[02:07:04.140 --> 02:07:08.100]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[02:07:08.100 --> 02:07:12.340]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[02:07:12.340 --> 02:07:16.620]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[02:07:16.620 --> 02:07:20.980]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[02:07:20.980 --> 02:07:25.060]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[02:07:25.060 --> 02:07:29.620]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[02:07:29.620 --> 02:07:33.740]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[02:07:33.740 --> 02:07:37.740]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[02:07:37.740 --> 02:07:41.540]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[02:07:41.540 --> 02:07:44.260]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[02:07:44.260 --> 02:07:49.220]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at WWW dot my
[02:07:49.220 --> 02:07:53.340]  solar backup dot com that's my solar backup dot com remember the government
[02:07:53.340 --> 02:08:00.300]  doesn't own the Sun should go to my solar backup dot com or call 1-877-327-0365
[02:08:00.300 --> 02:08:05.820]  this is communications radio network proudly presents the Alex Jones show
[02:08:05.820 --> 02:08:14.260]  because there's a war on for your mind last November the food safety
[02:08:14.260 --> 02:08:18.980]  modernization act that means radiating it spring line viruses on it that eat the
[02:08:18.980 --> 02:08:28.460]  E. coli bacteria but cause mutations narrowly was defeated but it passed the
[02:08:28.460 --> 02:08:31.660]  Senate got defeated in the house started now with the Senate they never got it
[02:08:31.660 --> 02:08:35.460]  done between the conference committee they have reintroduced it and you knew
[02:08:35.460 --> 02:08:39.980]  this was coming in Europe's doing the same thing because of the E. coli 20 or
[02:08:39.980 --> 02:08:43.020]  so deaths and the hundreds that are sick in Europe and it's in the European
[02:08:43.020 --> 02:08:46.620]  press that scientists are saying this is that genes added this didn't naturally
[02:08:46.620 --> 02:08:52.940]  mutate and British intelligence says Al Qaeda did it Al Qaeda did it and don't
[02:08:52.940 --> 02:08:56.020]  worry we told you last week and this week it was coming they've introduced
[02:08:56.020 --> 02:08:59.860]  these bills and in the food safety act last year haven't had a chance to read
[02:08:59.860 --> 02:09:03.660]  the new version yet because when Gerald said that I had a feeling and searched
[02:09:03.660 --> 02:09:08.100]  food safety act and boom reintroduced today haven't had time to read the text
[02:09:08.100 --> 02:09:15.980]  yet and last time it said fall adopt the UN's Treaty Codex Alimentarius a treaty
[02:09:15.980 --> 02:09:20.380]  in there under UN law you saw the headlines Daily Mail and others last
[02:09:20.380 --> 02:09:25.100]  month a BBC hundreds of vitamins and minerals and herbal remedies pulled from
[02:09:25.100 --> 02:09:31.300]  shelves in England and Europe under EU rules never thought it would happen it's
[02:09:31.300 --> 02:09:36.300]  happening and they put it in this bill and when it wouldn't pass that week
[02:09:36.300 --> 02:09:44.020]  17 million dollars was given by five mega agribusinesses took to the House and
[02:09:44.020 --> 02:09:49.220]  Senate the biggest spending for agriculture legislation a week on record
[02:09:49.220 --> 02:09:55.380]  and in there it shuts down your local farm and ranch you can't even can
[02:09:55.380 --> 02:09:58.260]  strawberries and give them to your neighbor you can't even serve it to your
[02:09:58.260 --> 02:10:02.180]  neighbor at dinner SWAT team you see him SWAT teaming Amish without even having
[02:10:02.180 --> 02:10:06.220]  the laws attacking health food stores folks they're now sitting in federal
[02:10:06.220 --> 02:10:10.740]  goons kicking down doors with local police under their command without
[02:10:10.740 --> 02:10:18.180]  warrants for unpaid tuition student loans I mean that's illegal I've studied it
[02:10:18.180 --> 02:10:22.020]  there we do we don't have debtor prisoners did debt prisons here like
[02:10:22.020 --> 02:10:26.180]  England had they got rid of it there was riots and wars over this it's all
[02:10:26.180 --> 02:10:29.780]  coming back I mean how does Bank of America take a house they never even
[02:10:29.780 --> 02:10:33.940]  owned or have the deed to those paid for in cash they were never connected they
[02:10:33.940 --> 02:10:37.740]  just do it I know I'm ranting I want to go to your calls for Gerald Salente but
[02:10:37.740 --> 02:10:42.380]  senator Kristen yellow brand announces food safety legislation and they go on
[02:10:42.380 --> 02:10:47.380]  to say they're basically introducing the same thing and the British government
[02:10:47.380 --> 02:10:51.420]  admitted in 2000 that they it was weaponized foot and mouth that was taken
[02:10:51.420 --> 02:10:56.300]  out of a level four weapons lab they said by an animal rights activist maybe no
[02:10:56.300 --> 02:11:00.380]  it and it showed up you know dozens of spots in one day no the government
[02:11:00.380 --> 02:11:04.260]  distributed it and then use it to try to shut down the farms over there mystery
[02:11:04.260 --> 02:11:07.180]  diseases are killing people sheep I was getting calls when I was on European
[02:11:07.180 --> 02:11:11.220]  radio Gerald I'm ranting it's just you brought this up and it opens up a whole
[02:11:11.220 --> 02:11:17.300]  another paradigm they are so lawless and because in the food safety act big
[02:11:17.300 --> 02:11:21.260]  agris exempt and they're the ones that are responsible in every major case for
[02:11:21.260 --> 02:11:24.900]  the E. Coli deaths in Salmonella but then they come in and want to shut us
[02:11:24.900 --> 02:11:30.260]  down I mean these it's total slavery Gerald it is and when you talk about
[02:11:30.260 --> 02:11:35.900]  student debts this student serves you don't get out of that debt thanks to Joe
[02:11:35.900 --> 02:11:42.620]  Biden when he was senator of the loophole state down there in Delaware they
[02:11:42.620 --> 02:11:48.060]  pushed that through you're an indentured servant for the rest of your life get it
[02:11:48.060 --> 02:11:54.900]  in your head you take out those student loans they own you it's student owned not
[02:11:54.900 --> 02:11:59.980]  loan you are they you're only being you're borrowing for the rest of your
[02:11:59.980 --> 02:12:05.420]  life to pay them off and then when you talk about what they're scaring us now
[02:12:05.420 --> 02:12:12.140]  with food if it's food terror war it's a very simple formula Alex and it's as
[02:12:12.140 --> 02:12:18.860]  old as the hills they get you with fear and hysteria those are the tools of the
[02:12:18.860 --> 02:12:25.060]  politicians and the religious fanatics they're in the same club and just to
[02:12:25.060 --> 02:12:35.060]  mention the only way that fear and hysteria are quashed is by beauty
[02:12:35.060 --> 02:12:41.540]  beauty of the mind is the heart and the soul beauty is the antidote to fear and
[02:12:41.540 --> 02:12:46.620]  people shouldn't forget that because if you do you're gonna be engulfed by their
[02:12:46.620 --> 02:12:52.220]  hysteria and fear and get on that cattle car there's a place at a FEMA camp
[02:12:52.220 --> 02:12:56.100]  waiting for you and by the way we said many years ago they would roll the
[02:12:56.100 --> 02:13:00.460]  FEMA camps out as places to help people that couldn't pay their bills that's how
[02:13:00.460 --> 02:13:04.900]  Germany started it in 3435 first you're in a ghetto you can't run your
[02:13:04.900 --> 02:13:09.220]  businesses once you run out of money we don't let you leave the area because
[02:13:09.220 --> 02:13:13.260]  we're not authorizing your papers then oh you're poor we're gonna load you up
[02:13:13.260 --> 02:13:17.380]  and take you to a work camp where you can pay to take care of yourself they're
[02:13:17.380 --> 02:13:22.420]  now in California and Hawaii locking the homeless up people are like well good
[02:13:22.420 --> 02:13:28.220]  we'll chew next and oh talking about making them work so it's on and
[02:13:28.220 --> 02:13:32.180]  everything we've seen is now being repeated I want to go to loaded phone
[02:13:32.180 --> 02:13:36.900]  lines here for you get as many as we can Gerald Salente and again for folks
[02:13:36.900 --> 02:13:40.260]  that just joined as people can subscribe and find out more at trendsresearch.com
[02:13:40.260 --> 02:13:46.220]  and valuable a weekly news blast in the quarterly magazine reports there at the
[02:13:46.220 --> 02:13:51.500]  key website trendsresearch.com and he also has some other alternate URLs that
[02:13:51.500 --> 02:13:56.780]  will get you to the same place but Gerald this is a transformation into
[02:13:56.780 --> 02:14:00.060]  classical tyranny and what you just said is so true whenever I'm worried
[02:14:00.060 --> 02:14:05.020]  whenever I'm upset I'm not in fear I'm more in a rage to defeat these people and
[02:14:05.020 --> 02:14:08.700]  that is a good thing but I'll just lay out under the trees and look at the blue
[02:14:08.700 --> 02:14:14.020]  sky and beauty in my in most instinctive level that well the globalists are
[02:14:14.020 --> 02:14:18.740]  ugly they create ugliness they hate beauty you look at the art they buy it's
[02:14:18.740 --> 02:14:23.100]  they're into sickness then we and I just feel like throwing myself into the
[02:14:23.100 --> 02:14:27.860]  gears to defeat them for beauty the beauty of my innocent children the
[02:14:27.860 --> 02:14:31.940]  beauty of of innocence the beauty of wholesomeness and private property and
[02:14:31.940 --> 02:14:37.300]  families everything they assault and then I have no fear I am ready to die if
[02:14:37.300 --> 02:14:41.820]  need be to defend beauty and when you said right there is very touching
[02:14:41.820 --> 02:14:46.340]  because that is exactly what is in my soul yeah we can't forget the human
[02:14:46.340 --> 02:14:51.260]  spirit and that's what they've taken away from us because art is the way of
[02:14:51.260 --> 02:14:55.420]  finding the true meaning of the human spirit you need any more proof than the
[02:14:55.420 --> 02:15:00.220]  Renaissance that was followed by the black death do you need any more proof
[02:15:00.220 --> 02:15:05.100]  when you see the greatness of the pyramids and the civilizations before
[02:15:05.100 --> 02:15:10.420]  of what beauty is created this has become nothing more than a disgusting
[02:15:10.420 --> 02:15:16.220]  bottom-line society isn't it wonderful going into a Walmart's having the
[02:15:16.220 --> 02:15:23.700]  experience of walking in to a large self-storage unit so we can change it but
[02:15:23.700 --> 02:15:29.300]  we have to change ourselves there's a great line Alex from the Hindus when the
[02:15:29.300 --> 02:15:35.660]  students ready the teacher appears the people have to get ready they have to
[02:15:35.660 --> 02:15:42.660]  get in shape physically emotionally and spiritually and the advertisers that you
[02:15:42.660 --> 02:15:49.420]  have on your show help them get there absolutely and folks by funding alternative
[02:15:49.420 --> 02:15:54.020]  media you're voting in the marketplace you're listing us on local AM and FM's
[02:15:54.020 --> 02:15:57.620]  you're a business owner go sponsor that station and tell them we're doing this
[02:15:57.620 --> 02:16:03.300]  because you put Alex Jones on weekdays you put him on in prime time folks it's
[02:16:03.300 --> 02:16:08.180]  happening this message of liberty the people are ready but you've got to
[02:16:08.180 --> 02:16:12.720]  deliver it let's go to Alex in Illinois you're on the air with our guest
[02:16:12.720 --> 02:16:17.540]  Gerald Solente hi Alex I Joe I appreciate your time and taking my call
[02:16:17.540 --> 02:16:21.420]  originally I called with a question about hyperinflation and whether or not in
[02:16:21.420 --> 02:16:25.940]  your opinion QE3 would actually lead to that scenario and how it affects the
[02:16:25.940 --> 02:16:29.140]  working Americans everyday life but since I've been on hold listening I'd
[02:16:29.140 --> 02:16:32.300]  actually like to change my question and I'd like to ask Gerald's opinion about
[02:16:32.300 --> 02:16:36.340]  coldest element areas and how we think that would affect the economy would it
[02:16:36.340 --> 02:16:40.220]  drive up food costs are we looking at food riots or what's that going to do
[02:16:40.220 --> 02:16:45.180]  you shut everything down and I'm sorry go ahead go ahead you know they they
[02:16:45.180 --> 02:16:48.420]  are it's of course it's gonna affect us it works than that's gonna affect our
[02:16:48.420 --> 02:16:53.180]  hell and anybody that doesn't think that there's a you know you don't need to be
[02:16:53.180 --> 02:16:57.340]  a conspiracy theorist to talk about a new world order just look at where the
[02:16:57.340 --> 02:17:02.300]  money goes from the Federal Reserve what they call their discount window it goes

[02:18:45.580 --> 02:18:49.540]  can't afford to buy gold and silver one of the best things we can do to protect
[02:18:49.540 --> 02:18:56.500]  ourselves and it's an oncoming health storm that we're facing you know it's
[02:18:56.500 --> 02:19:03.340]  it's really hard just keep making your voice heard as much as you can everything

[02:19:19.420 --> 02:19:25.180]  didn't meditate every day and it goes back into getting in as I said shape as
[02:19:25.180 --> 02:19:30.180]  best you can physically emotionally and spiritually that's the best we can do
[02:19:30.180 --> 02:19:35.660]  and surround yourself as I said with the beauty that you can do you know beauty
[02:19:35.660 --> 02:19:40.820]  doesn't have to cost a lot of money it means not buying crap and it means
[02:19:40.820 --> 02:19:46.460]  associating with people that aren't afflicted with negativity all the time
[02:19:46.460 --> 02:19:51.460]  absolutely it's realizing how powerful you are and that you do have power and

[02:24:21.980 --> 02:24:27.660]  alternative media and support themselves support those that tell the truth
[02:24:27.660 --> 02:24:32.060]  that's voting with your dollars to build the Liberty movement against tyranny

[02:24:54.620 --> 02:24:59.060]  on the air but you're also in time good afternoon gentlemen how's it going today
[02:24:59.060 --> 02:25:03.500]  good I was I was kind of curious to do some research in history that come to
[02:25:03.500 --> 02:25:08.260]  find out that these bankers have a mask and mercenary army to imprison the
[02:25:08.260 --> 02:25:12.900]  population is there a way to reverse that by amassing our own mercenary army
[02:25:12.900 --> 02:25:16.820]  to imprison them well that's why they want a global private corporate system
[02:25:16.820 --> 02:25:20.940]  that that is above the law Gerald your view on that now we're not going to be
[02:25:20.940 --> 02:25:25.900]  we can't need violence with violence it has to be an intellectual revolution
[02:25:25.900 --> 02:25:30.300]  what you know one of the mind the body the soul the spirit and again we could
[02:25:30.300 --> 02:25:34.620]  outflank them they're very easily defeated as I said I really believe a
[02:25:34.620 --> 02:25:41.900]  solution is direct democracy let the people vote let the people vote this is
[02:25:41.900 --> 02:25:48.940]  America I don't need Pelosi I don't need Bonner I don't need any of them telling
[02:25:48.940 --> 02:25:54.380]  me what I should think or what I should believe and you notice you know I we
[02:25:54.380 --> 02:25:59.020]  could make it happen Alex we could do it through the internet it's journalism
[02:25:59.020 --> 02:26:06.340]  2.0 it's democracy 2.0 let the people vote well going back to something you
[02:26:06.340 --> 02:26:11.140]  just mentioned the Pentagon for at least two decades has said that 90% of their
[02:26:11.140 --> 02:26:14.740]  operations are psychological and they admit they do it against the American
[02:26:14.740 --> 02:26:17.740]  people where people will just select their rest if they're told it's for the
[02:26:17.740 --> 02:26:21.580]  military but when the military is being hurt by the bankers people say well
[02:26:21.580 --> 02:26:27.660]  that's fine because the TV didn't tell me that was a problem but nine nine times
[02:26:27.660 --> 02:26:32.060]  out of ten it is psychological that's why they try to dumb us down if we rise
[02:26:32.060 --> 02:26:36.460]  above and become aware of what they've done and wake up to the false
[02:26:36.460 --> 02:26:40.020]  narratives they've given us we can defeat these people they're a paper
[02:26:40.020 --> 02:26:44.540]  tiger exactly and I've been there I used to work in a New York State Senate I
[02:26:44.540 --> 02:26:48.620]  worked in Washington DC I know what it looks like they're nothing they're a
[02:26:48.620 --> 02:26:54.900]  bunch of wieners garbage how much more do you have to know look at this guy
[02:26:54.900 --> 02:27:00.380]  there are 500 and something of him they're all alike with the exception of a
[02:27:00.380 --> 02:27:07.660]  few like Iran Paul a few men out there the rest of wieners and I'd also like to
[02:27:07.660 --> 02:27:14.580]  say this Alex that this is a very crucial time if we don't act now we're
[02:27:14.580 --> 02:27:22.820]  lost so very everybody should stand up speak out expose the hypocrites for who
[02:27:22.820 --> 02:27:28.380]  they are God bless you great job the Bilderberg protest people all over Europe

[02:34:02.940 --> 02:34:06.300]  can just do it from the mountaintop that obviously had better internet of course
[02:34:06.300 --> 02:34:10.380]  the globalists have the best internet we're down the hill the little slaves
[02:34:10.380 --> 02:34:17.020]  below them and one of the cheaper hotels it's only 300 euros a night so we're
[02:34:17.020 --> 02:34:20.140]  gonna be talking to them very soon a lot of other important breaking news we're
[02:34:20.140 --> 02:34:24.060]  gonna try to make history together here with this big demonstration against
[02:34:24.060 --> 02:34:28.380]  Bilderberg group and their tyranny and their forced austerity people all over
[02:34:28.380 --> 02:34:31.780]  Europe are getting angry and demonstrating the enemy the people that did
[02:34:31.780 --> 02:34:35.980]  all this the people that need to be exposed in the info war peacefully are
[02:34:35.980 --> 02:34:39.700]  the Bilderberg group and we're gonna have our reporters there covering it we
[02:34:39.700 --> 02:34:45.340]  need media there this Saturday high noon St. Moritz there in Switzerland get
[02:34:45.340 --> 02:34:48.580]  there if you're in Spain if you're in France if you're in Switzerland
[02:34:48.580 --> 02:34:52.820]  especially if you're in the Netherlands if you're in Italy who's right there it's
[02:34:52.820 --> 02:34:57.140]  right by Italy if you're in Austria right there get in there get over there
[02:34:57.140 --> 02:35:02.420]  you don't have any excuse this Saturday hi noon I'm calling for it okay and we'll
[02:35:02.420 --> 02:35:07.020]  be here covering it we'll have live feeds and info wars dot com and prison
[02:35:07.020 --> 02:35:12.460]  planet dot com but on our end as I said this cost money and Ted Anderson of
[02:35:12.460 --> 02:35:16.460]  modest resources finance this and again he has radio specials we can get three
[02:35:16.460 --> 02:35:20.100]  silver dollars and three of my best-selling films and free shipping
[02:35:20.100 --> 02:35:24.540]  so you pay for the silver dollars at an incredibly low price you can call them
[02:35:24.540 --> 02:35:28.580]  it it varies depending on the market that actually doesn't vary he changes it
[02:35:28.580 --> 02:35:31.900]  every week or so if silver goes up or down but they got super good deals on
[02:35:31.900 --> 02:35:36.280]  that three silver dollars and you get three of my films free and free
[02:35:36.280 --> 02:35:40.100]  shipping I mean nobody can top that and I know Ted has no markup on that deal
[02:35:40.100 --> 02:35:43.980]  it's a lost leader but that's what he wants pitched for his sponsorship of
[02:35:43.980 --> 02:35:54.860]  this so 800 686 237 800 686 2237 if you want to call Midas resources they've
[02:35:54.860 --> 02:35:59.420]  got a lot other radio specials all their deals are very competitive many of them
[02:35:59.420 --> 02:36:03.820]  smoking but the radio specials they have a whole list of them and the brokers are
[02:36:03.820 --> 02:36:08.660]  there 30 plus of them guys upwards of 50 now with the sheet of the specials and
[02:36:08.660 --> 02:36:16.500]  it's boom no haggle this is the deal you want boom 800 686 2237 800 686 237 now
[02:36:16.500 --> 02:36:23.700]  let me compose myself before we go to the guys and really focused on all the
[02:36:23.700 --> 02:36:27.260]  all the incredible information that we've just learned I want to add one
[02:36:27.260 --> 02:36:33.380]  caveat obviously I'll do 15 20 minutes of overdrive and some station managers
[02:36:33.380 --> 02:36:37.380]  said well that that's fine that you do overdrive we understand that we really
[02:36:37.380 --> 02:36:41.260]  pioneered that and Glenn Beck and Howard Stern have copied it and that's
[02:36:41.260 --> 02:36:45.980]  wonderful you know we started the fourth hour five years ago and that's what
[02:36:45.980 --> 02:36:49.940]  Beck calls it his fourth hour that's only internet but I said why not just make
[02:36:49.940 --> 02:36:53.100]  the fourth hour on satellite now so I did that for a few years or was actually
[02:36:53.100 --> 02:36:56.020]  on the radio to stations picked it up but now I'm getting ready to launch my
[02:36:56.020 --> 02:36:59.780]  new TV show that Beck's copying which again I think is great that's the most
[02:36:59.780 --> 02:37:04.420]  sincere form of flattery is imitation and so I had to cut that fourth hour but
[02:37:04.420 --> 02:37:08.700]  then I get greedy wanting to fight the globalist I'm greedy for truth I'm like
[02:37:08.700 --> 02:37:13.140]  an attack dog who wants more and so I'll do 20 minutes or so into the next hour
[02:37:13.140 --> 02:37:16.740]  but when you hear the show in on AM and FM the show's over tune into their next
[02:37:16.740 --> 02:37:21.100]  great show wonderful support their sponsors only every once in a while do I
[02:37:21.100 --> 02:37:24.900]  do this overdrive soon I've heard the TV show I won't be able to do it anymore so
[02:37:24.900 --> 02:37:28.220]  this won't be an issue anymore but we will do about 20 minutes of overdrive into
[02:37:28.220 --> 02:37:34.180]  the next hour and that way I can get into some of the other news but we've
[02:37:34.180 --> 02:37:38.180]  got 23 minutes left in the official transmission I want to just say great
[02:37:38.180 --> 02:37:42.220]  job to my crew here as well you can follow everything we're doing at info
[02:37:42.220 --> 02:37:46.740]  wars.com and prisonplanet.com I can also go to overdrive and take some of the
[02:37:46.740 --> 02:37:49.460]  callers that are holding if you want to hold or we'll open the phones up again
[02:37:49.460 --> 02:37:53.780]  then but we have this top story exclusive live video and photos from
[02:37:53.780 --> 02:38:01.340]  Bilderberg continually updated then I have another report intimidating the
[02:38:01.340 --> 02:38:06.020]  media Bilderberg security sees info wars reporters passport I think I'll change
[02:38:06.020 --> 02:38:09.340]  that he is an info wars reporter but he's really an RT reporter and that was
[02:38:09.340 --> 02:38:12.180]  the headline I wanted but we're gonna have that changed and beefed up a bit
[02:38:12.180 --> 02:38:16.420]  it's just a blurb with video of it happening also Bilderbergs may give
[02:38:16.420 --> 02:38:24.020]  green light to Mexican central banker at new IMF boss that's big also the
[02:38:24.020 --> 02:38:27.740]  exclusive live video photos for Bilderberg continually updated that is so
[02:38:27.740 --> 02:38:31.860]  important also another link exclusive reporters live from Switzerland on the
[02:38:31.860 --> 02:38:36.820]  Bilderbergs but Kurt's got his big report coming out I'll tell you the
[02:38:36.820 --> 02:38:41.740]  headline here in about 10 minutes when it goes live but the big kahuna report
[02:38:41.740 --> 02:38:46.500]  the leaked inside agenda Bilderberg breaking here coming up in 10 minutes
[02:38:46.500 --> 02:38:51.540]  let's go to Paul Joseph Watson joining us from nearby the Bilderberg group
[02:38:51.540 --> 02:38:56.340]  meeting he was on site earlier he's gonna go back soon but Paul Watson
[02:38:56.340 --> 02:39:01.380]  thanks for joining us good to be here Alex what did you see in the time after
[02:39:01.380 --> 02:39:05.700]  we talked earlier from on site with your live video feed from the time you left
[02:39:05.700 --> 02:39:11.380]  and just break down overall what you've witnessed today and what you think the
[02:39:11.380 --> 02:39:18.780]  most important developments are what happened after afterwards was by
[02:39:18.780 --> 02:39:23.300]  simply we just hung around for a little longer there were groups of young people
[02:39:23.300 --> 02:39:28.780]  actually entering the Bilderberg compound but we guess that is because they
[02:39:28.780 --> 02:39:32.900]  live further down in the area and they had credentials that they were wearing
[02:39:32.900 --> 02:39:38.740]  around their neck they showed to the police and they were later then after
[02:39:38.740 --> 02:39:44.140]  that we were just talking to some people and take some more photographs we left
[02:39:44.140 --> 02:39:50.780]  and some ways down the road a good probably half a mile down the road
[02:39:50.780 --> 02:39:56.660]  there are more police with dogs so it's not just around the hotel itself it's
[02:39:56.660 --> 02:40:03.260]  they're on surrounding roads as he stated earlier Luke Radowski and the
[02:40:03.260 --> 02:40:10.060]  video is up on infowords.com was asked for his passport and they kept his
[02:40:10.060 --> 02:40:13.740]  passport for about half an hour before he got it back and basically told him if
[02:40:13.740 --> 02:40:18.940]  you don't hand it over we're gonna arrest you we weren't asked we went right up to
[02:40:18.940 --> 02:40:25.060]  the security point where the bar is where they didn't ask us for any ID and at
[02:40:25.060 --> 02:40:29.940]  the moment where just getting all the high quality photos posted on info wars
[02:40:29.940 --> 02:40:35.500]  and prison planet well Paul you don't know about this yet but I've got your
[02:40:35.500 --> 02:40:40.300]  brother from London Steve Watson a master's in political science in his own
[02:40:40.300 --> 02:40:44.540]  right and I point that out because he's one of the smartest people I know
[02:40:44.540 --> 02:40:49.380]  along with Paul just great researchers you're guys I can just call who
[02:40:49.380 --> 02:40:52.500]  immediately get it and already have a full spectrum understanding of what's
[02:40:52.500 --> 02:40:56.300]  going on he's doing a report that'll go up on prison planet we've got two big
[02:40:56.300 --> 02:41:01.220]  things breaking we've got the agenda of Bilderberg from from the mole via Tucker
[02:41:01.220 --> 02:41:06.500]  and others a large part of the agenda we're trying to get an actual run down
[02:41:06.500 --> 02:41:09.380]  sometimes Tucker's even able to get that from his mole but the mole's got a
[02:41:09.380 --> 02:41:12.740]  sneak off site to do it and that's another thing you got to follow Tucker
[02:41:12.740 --> 02:41:16.860]  some because he's always got people cars following him and spies outside his room
[02:41:16.860 --> 02:41:21.940]  and he was shot at in Portugal that was reported on by major newspapers in 99 so
[02:41:21.940 --> 02:41:26.900]  obviously you're gonna go get the latest intel from Tucker keep filing reports
[02:41:26.900 --> 02:41:32.620]  on that we've got all of this unfolding feel free to do more of the upload
[02:41:32.620 --> 02:41:36.060]  videos that you're doing that we have a live link up on info wars comm of
[02:41:36.060 --> 02:41:40.100]  throughout the evening throughout tomorrow it officially kicks off tomorrow
[02:41:40.100 --> 02:41:45.860]  but the big news my friend is I'm calling for a global protest against the
[02:41:45.860 --> 02:41:50.220]  austerity bankers who we know we're meeting there at this event pushing for
[02:41:50.220 --> 02:41:55.180]  bigger bailouts ie thefts for them we know that that is happening we know
[02:41:55.180 --> 02:41:58.340]  they're there trying to start the new war in the Middle East a wider war we
[02:41:58.340 --> 02:42:01.140]  know they're pushing for internet censorship we know their agenda now a
[02:42:01.140 --> 02:42:06.900]  large portion of it and so we're gonna have a massive protest Saturday at noon
[02:42:06.900 --> 02:42:11.420]  in St. Merritt Switzerland we're calling for the Swiss to come out the red
[02:42:11.420 --> 02:42:14.940]  codes aren't coming the banksters are coming we're calling for peaceful
[02:42:14.940 --> 02:42:18.260]  demonstration we're calling people to call the media demand they be there and
[02:42:18.260 --> 02:42:22.540]  for folks from all over Europe instead of just protesting at police stations and
[02:42:22.540 --> 02:42:27.020]  being water cannon peacefully come here and say there are the criminals there
[02:42:27.020 --> 02:42:30.340]  are the people the lot of Builderburg people can't even go because there's
[02:42:30.340 --> 02:42:33.900]  indictments out we'll see if Kissinger shows up but that's the big
[02:42:33.900 --> 02:42:37.020]  announcement get it out to everybody everybody Twitter it tweeted Steve's
[02:42:37.020 --> 02:42:41.820]  gonna have it out very soon at prisonplanet.com okay great Aaron you're
[02:42:41.820 --> 02:42:45.100]  now there on with Paul Paul what do you make of this announcement that we're
[02:42:45.100 --> 02:42:48.900]  gonna have this big protest and then talk about what you make of all this
[02:42:48.900 --> 02:42:54.980]  security everything else is happening well that there were about 20 to 25
[02:42:54.980 --> 02:42:59.900]  people there at the time that we went and to be honest from why I saw it in
[02:42:59.900 --> 02:43:04.820]  Spain on the video last year and certainly Greece if you remember Greece
[02:43:04.820 --> 02:43:08.220]  and Turkey they were just mass protesting the street hundreds and
[02:43:08.220 --> 02:43:13.180]  thousands of people so we definitely need more people there obviously this is a
[02:43:13.180 --> 02:43:18.460]  remote area and it takes a while to drive to from the airport but we
[02:43:18.460 --> 02:43:23.260]  definitely need as many people as possible to throw the spotlight on these
[02:43:23.260 --> 02:43:28.220]  Builderburg criminals that are meeting up in the mountains at the moment
[02:43:28.220 --> 02:43:33.700]  now Paul again I can rant all day and make my points but we need everybody to
[02:43:33.700 --> 02:43:38.620]  get Twitter's out phone calls news websites the the Google search term
[02:43:38.620 --> 02:43:42.980]  today we've got to make it number one Builderburg protest two words entered
[02:43:42.980 --> 02:43:45.740]  into Google and Yahoo and everywhere else over and over again everybody write
[02:43:45.740 --> 02:43:50.940]  your own articles get global attention on to this Builderburg protest you can
[02:43:50.940 --> 02:43:56.220]  also reverse it and then say protest Builderburg okay Builderburg group a lot
[02:43:56.220 --> 02:43:59.300]  of times becomes the number one search during this week anyways so we're going
[02:43:59.300 --> 02:44:02.260]  to push it over the edge it's become the number one search term the next hour
[02:44:02.260 --> 02:44:07.340]  or two that's how it always works Builderburg protest protest Builderburg
[02:44:07.340 --> 02:44:11.940]  reverse those two but the first main term we're doing is Builderburg protest
[02:44:11.940 --> 02:44:15.540]  put those words in I'm even doing it myself during the break in the Google
[02:44:15.540 --> 02:44:19.740]  box we need to make that number one in the global call and I want to make sure
[02:44:19.740 --> 02:44:23.660]  I need to call Steve back to make sure in his article that he explains these of
[02:44:23.660 --> 02:44:27.300]  the bankers these are the crooks why protesting your capitals though your
[02:44:27.300 --> 02:44:31.220]  capitals have been bought off by these criminals go to where the real scum is
[02:44:31.220 --> 02:44:36.980]  this Saturday high noon that gives us three days to build up Paul that's right
[02:44:36.980 --> 02:44:40.900]  and if you're flying into the Eurica Airport it's about two and a half to
[02:44:40.900 --> 02:44:45.980]  drive out there and the scenery is just breathtaking so even if you don't get
[02:44:45.980 --> 02:44:50.660]  anything else out of it I mean the place itself is beautiful and it's just a
[02:44:50.660 --> 02:44:59.340]  shame that the people meeting here are not well France of course Austria and
[02:44:59.340 --> 02:45:03.580]  Italy are right there we're talking hours from this but in the Swiss and we

[02:45:15.180 --> 02:45:18.220]  times the mafia hires communists to come out and protest to make folks look
[02:45:18.220 --> 02:45:22.300]  bad let's have true liberty patriots there explaining who's there and I got a
[02:45:22.300 --> 02:45:25.540]  call Steve bags gonna make sure in the article explain these are the people
[02:45:25.540 --> 02:45:29.660]  bringing in another wave of economic implosion and global austerity Paul
[02:45:29.660 --> 02:45:34.060]  video can't capture what you see with your eyes any other observations how
[02:45:34.060 --> 02:45:39.020]  were the police's mannerisms what was their bearing were they robotic or were
[02:45:39.020 --> 02:45:45.660]  they looking at you as if you were scum or were they friendly they were
[02:45:45.660 --> 02:45:49.900]  giving us the eyeball but on the whole they didn't really harass us at all
[02:45:49.900 --> 02:45:54.460]  they just let us film they let us video record other people were saying the
[02:45:54.460 --> 02:46:00.060]  police carrying around guns but we didn't see any guns some of them appeared
[02:46:00.060 --> 02:46:03.140]  to have some kind of pays a device although that could have just been a
[02:46:03.140 --> 02:46:07.900]  baton the Swiss are the most heavily armed sorry go ahead there were other
[02:46:07.900 --> 02:46:13.060]  people who were saying that there were people in the streets down in the actual
[02:46:13.060 --> 02:46:18.180]  town itself because the hotels up in the hills there are there was secret police
[02:46:18.180 --> 02:46:22.380]  walking around asking for people's ID that's what that's what the journalists
[02:46:22.380 --> 02:46:27.500]  who were already there told us but from what we saw certainly if you compare it
[02:46:27.500 --> 02:46:31.740]  to watch only skeleton experienced in the grease where he was constantly
[02:46:31.740 --> 02:46:36.820]  harassed and arrested and followed around the security and the police were
[02:46:36.820 --> 02:46:42.980]  reasonably kind within that they didn't harass us or ask for ID or anything
[02:46:42.980 --> 02:46:46.740]  but of course there's a long way to go yeah in the US they did some of that and
[02:46:46.740 --> 02:46:49.380]  would try to tell us to turn the cameras off but after we told them we weren't
[02:46:49.380 --> 02:46:52.700]  going to do it then they behave themselves in Virginia and it's a shame
[02:46:52.700 --> 02:46:58.300]  that the cops are so willing to energetically protect literally a
[02:46:58.300 --> 02:47:02.860]  bunch of criminals I mean these people are globalist tyrants and we're
[02:47:02.860 --> 02:47:07.420]  streaming video right now from Justin TV also about Luke talking about how he
[02:47:07.420 --> 02:47:13.740]  was detained for 40 minutes and his passport taken stay on the line Paul but
[02:47:13.740 --> 02:47:17.500]  we've got Aaron Dykes there with us Aaron what are your observations at the
[02:47:17.500 --> 02:47:22.060]  first day the prelude to the kickoff tomorrow morning of the global crime
[02:47:22.060 --> 02:47:27.140]  syndicate meeting well Alex to start with the literal I'm literally looking at
[02:47:27.140 --> 02:47:32.220]  the hotel where the Bilderberger staying right now for my hotel window along
[02:47:32.220 --> 02:47:36.180]  with these gorgeous mountains and frankly like Paul was saying I'd rather
[02:47:36.180 --> 02:47:39.620]  turn my attention to the natural beauty but we can't ignore what they're doing
[02:47:39.620 --> 02:47:44.300]  on this planet and the way they're controlling but one major contradiction
[02:47:44.300 --> 02:47:50.020]  I did in fact see police with sidearms and I'm not sure if the security also had
[02:47:50.020 --> 02:47:55.380]  them but I definitely saw pistols and there was a baton which may have also
[02:47:55.380 --> 02:47:59.900]  been one of those tasing baton devices we don't know for sure but it's not the
[02:47:59.900 --> 02:48:06.060]  usual thing in in Italy or in Spain or in Greece where they have sub machine
[02:48:06.060 --> 02:48:11.540]  guns they shove in your face no we haven't seen the sub machine gun people
[02:48:11.540 --> 02:48:16.780]  here yet perhaps you know tomorrow could be another day they're not there right
[02:48:16.780 --> 02:48:19.660]  now they were not there I'll say this I don't have a problem of the cops being
[02:48:19.660 --> 02:48:22.300]  like that in Switzerland because the citizens can run around with their fully
[02:48:22.300 --> 02:48:25.100]  autos and hand grenades they had the lowest crime rate in the world so I
[02:48:25.100 --> 02:48:28.700]  think it's great more guns less crime other points Aaron that are key for
[02:48:28.700 --> 02:48:35.860]  folks to know well we were just obviously gonna keep an eye on what's going on
[02:48:35.860 --> 02:48:40.860]  we know the groups they're part of and how their agendas merge so we're gonna
[02:48:40.860 --> 02:48:44.660]  have those points come out as you know a lot of the talking points have come out
[02:48:44.660 --> 02:48:49.780]  from the past years of things they've discussed and among it are the Arab
[02:48:49.780 --> 02:48:54.700]  Spring the revolutions of the Middle East they talked about that at 2010 and
[02:48:54.700 --> 02:49:02.140]  60th Spain and I really expect to see an escalation of that agenda for the rest
[02:49:02.140 --> 02:49:07.600]  of this year amazing I want to come back and talk strategy but in the next 10
[02:49:07.600 --> 02:49:11.500]  15 minutes Kurt that's why we're going into overdrive for internet listeners
[02:49:11.500 --> 02:49:17.940]  only at info wars.com that's why Kurt Nemo is in their laboring on this big
[02:49:17.940 --> 02:49:23.940]  report that we've got the agenda from Tucker's mold a lot of it's been
[02:49:23.940 --> 02:49:28.380]  confirmed by the Swiss papers that confirm they are deciding from their
[02:49:28.380 --> 02:49:33.140]  sources who the next IMF head will be and reportedly they're looking at it
[02:49:33.140 --> 02:49:41.180]  being the Mexican Bankster out of Mexico the Finance Minister we've also got the
[02:49:41.180 --> 02:49:45.180]  fact that they do want to have a larger conflagration that they are stirring up
[02:49:45.180 --> 02:49:49.860]  the war in the Middle East as a political diversion and they're very upset
[02:49:49.860 --> 02:49:55.920]  that Congress is talking about standing up to Obama going to war with UN
[02:49:55.920 --> 02:49:59.300]  authority I mean it'd be bad the president did it on his own it's even
[02:49:59.300 --> 02:50:03.220]  worse to do it and say I have UN authority and not talk to Congress so
[02:50:03.220 --> 02:50:07.740]  that's going on they're moved to go after the alternative media the fact that
[02:50:07.740 --> 02:50:11.180]  they're scared of the alternative media and the awakening to them we've got a
[02:50:11.180 --> 02:50:15.460]  large part of it now Tucker's gonna get more Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday
[02:50:15.460 --> 02:50:19.340]  we'll have continual coverage here for you gentlemen but when we come back I

[02:50:29.420 --> 02:50:34.300]  tidbits we'll cover on the other side well there are numerous reports that
[02:50:34.300 --> 02:50:37.980]  have come out in the past few hours there's one from Swiss info there's
[02:50:37.980 --> 02:50:45.060]  another from expatica.com those Charlie skeletons by our report and most of them
[02:50:45.060 --> 02:50:50.580]  are quite generic downplaying the event so we can discuss how the media is

[02:54:18.100 --> 02:54:22.620]  confront the actual criminals not their puppet capitals in Europe over the
[02:54:22.620 --> 02:54:26.060]  austerity the lion's share of the European tax money and our tax money is
[02:54:26.060 --> 02:54:31.300]  going to these criminals these are the engineers of our pain and high noon in
[02:54:31.300 --> 02:54:35.060]  St. Moritz Switzerland if you're in Europe folks you need to be there high
[02:54:35.060 --> 02:54:40.220]  noon get there that is the protest date high noon key Google search term Google
[02:54:40.220 --> 02:54:45.100]  it right now put it in over and over again a Google bomb Bilderberg protest and
[02:54:45.100 --> 02:54:48.820]  then you can reverse it and search it protest Bilderberg and that will lead
[02:54:48.820 --> 02:54:52.460]  them to the protest article that Steve Watson will soon get up at prison
[02:54:52.460 --> 02:54:57.940]  planet dot com I cannot stress to you how important this is and soon Kurt
[02:54:57.940 --> 02:55:03.620]  Nemo will have his exclusive report this is breaking here with with more
[02:55:03.620 --> 02:55:08.900]  details we've been given so far on the the first portion of the agenda that
[02:55:08.900 --> 02:55:13.940]  we've gotten from a man who a hundred percent has the Intel so this is huge
[02:55:13.940 --> 02:55:19.460]  going back to Aaron Dykes Aaron other points I mean this looks like more
[02:55:19.460 --> 02:55:24.500]  security though with with cameras and a tarp to block the cars and all of this
[02:55:24.500 --> 02:55:29.380]  then we've and floodlights and we've seen at previous events right take for
[02:55:29.380 --> 02:55:33.780]  instance Canada where they use the backdoor ramp drop so they could hide
[02:55:33.780 --> 02:55:39.420]  a lot of their high-profile people including including Hillary Clinton this
[02:55:39.420 --> 02:55:44.060]  year they have the entrance checkpoint where they do the key validation they
[02:55:44.060 --> 02:55:49.180]  can show the people on the list and they put up a barrier wall you know keeping
[02:55:49.180 --> 02:55:54.220]  down the visibility so you identify or easily take pictures then they've got
[02:55:54.220 --> 02:55:59.980]  roughly a hundred and fifty yards maybe even 200 yards to the main entrance so
[02:55:59.980 --> 02:56:04.780]  it's quite receded it's covered in trees and they really made it a challenge to
[02:56:04.780 --> 02:56:09.540]  photograph and this is our government representatives violating the Logan Act
[02:56:09.540 --> 02:56:14.580]  Hillary was fined what was it 300,000 for this back in the end mid 90s going and
[02:56:14.580 --> 02:56:18.820]  meeting and hiding and then lying and being caught not wanting the media to
[02:56:18.820 --> 02:56:22.980]  cover it but usually it's only the alternative media covers it anyways but
[02:56:22.980 --> 02:56:27.060]  I'm looking at these photos you can get down the road with the zoom camera to
[02:56:27.060 --> 02:56:31.260]  zoom in and still get shots of them at that checkpoint there's more than one
[02:56:31.260 --> 02:56:37.140]  way to skin a cat in the info war and we're going to get these videos they'll
[02:56:37.140 --> 02:56:43.060]  undoubtedly also be toggling around in the resort below and so you know what to
[02:56:43.060 --> 02:56:46.940]  do there we're going to get the video and identify these criminals and their
[02:56:46.940 --> 02:56:52.740]  activities Aaron yeah and they know we're watching him I mean with the
[02:56:52.740 --> 02:56:56.380]  protesters that are here now are very visible and if we get a lot more numbers
[02:56:56.380 --> 02:57:01.580]  the message will clearly be sent for those that do come to the village it's
[02:57:01.580 --> 02:57:07.540]  quite small so you will be seen you will be heard I would imagine there's a lot
[02:57:07.540 --> 02:57:11.180]  of places to stay of course a few places it closed down because it's off season
[02:57:11.180 --> 02:57:16.460]  from the ski resort but there should be room to come on down and you can
[02:57:16.460 --> 02:57:21.420]  literally see it it's kind of up on the hill the master hotel overlooking the
[02:57:21.420 --> 02:57:26.540]  lake that's part of the mountains here in St. Moritz and so if they do leave the
[02:57:26.540 --> 02:57:30.980]  hotel I would imagine they too will be easily seen and I think it would be hard
[02:57:30.980 --> 02:57:36.180]  for them to hide Alex well Aaron I am calling on everybody we need to make
[02:57:36.180 --> 02:57:39.940]  this big we need the people of Europe and the world are being robbed by these
[02:57:39.940 --> 02:57:44.940]  folks to actually go confront the people that are buying and selling our
[02:57:44.940 --> 02:57:51.180]  politicians and also everyone should pick newspapers and TV in Switzerland to
[02:57:51.180 --> 02:57:56.900]  call but also international media and demand they cover it if you had a 125
[02:57:56.900 --> 02:58:03.100]  top media people or Hollywood folks meeting it would be helicopters the
[02:58:03.100 --> 02:58:08.940]  press thousands of gawking spectators but they try to run this electronic
[02:58:08.940 --> 02:58:12.980]  Berlin Wall and have this blackout we've got to break that blackout in the
[02:58:12.980 --> 02:58:15.980]  American press that's another issue where's Bilderberg in the U.S. News
[02:58:15.980 --> 02:58:19.780]  there's a blackout on that gentlemen stay there let's do five minutes into the
[02:58:19.780 --> 02:58:25.100]  next hour for internet only for stations the main show's ending we'll be over at
[02:58:25.100 --> 02:58:30.100]  info wars.com and we'll continue on the audio and video streams at prisonplanet.tv
[02:58:30.100 --> 02:58:34.940]  to cover what's happening then I'll go over the agenda as soon as Kurt's
[02:58:34.940 --> 02:58:39.180]  article comes out it's set to come out any minute the big protest Saturday be
[02:58:39.180 --> 02:58:48.780]  there more coverage tomorrow thank you for listening to GCN visit GCN live.com
[02:58:48.780 --> 02:58:54.220]  today this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[02:58:54.220 --> 02:58:58.580]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[02:58:58.580 --> 02:59:02.740]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[02:59:02.740 --> 02:59:06.780]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[02:59:06.780 --> 02:59:10.660]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[02:59:10.660 --> 02:59:14.700]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[02:59:14.700 --> 02:59:19.100]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[02:59:19.100 --> 02:59:23.380]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[02:59:23.380 --> 02:59:27.100]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number

[02:59:51.140 --> 02:59:57.380]  coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones
[02:59:57.380 --> 03:00:19.460]  Broadcasting Network network
[03:00:19.460 --> 03:00:22.140]  incredible coverage of the global crime syndicate meeting in St. Merritt
[03:00:22.140 --> 03:00:27.340]  Switzerland we're now into internet only overdrive well we're on the satellite
[03:00:27.340 --> 03:00:31.420]  stations can pick this up if they want we've been talking to Paul Watson we're
[03:00:31.420 --> 03:00:37.420]  talking to Aaron Dykes and we've got two big reports of the big announcement of
[03:00:37.420 --> 03:00:41.140]  the global protest to convene Saturday at high noon in St. Merritt
[03:00:41.140 --> 03:00:46.140]  Switzerland and big chunks of the super secret Bilderberg agenda from the mole
[03:00:46.140 --> 03:00:49.740]  we've got through Tucker and others and a lot of what Tucker's now said is also
[03:00:49.740 --> 03:00:53.580]  confirmed by Swiss newspaper that a lot of big decisions are being made as we
[03:00:53.580 --> 03:00:58.380]  knew this is huge news so that's all coming out very very soon I'll keep
[03:00:58.380 --> 03:01:03.220]  doing overdrive until I get the info and cover it here but gentlemen Paul
[03:01:03.220 --> 03:01:07.380]  Watson so much to talk about as soon as you hang up the phone you're gonna
[03:01:07.380 --> 03:01:12.020]  remember some issues you forgot to cover what else is important that people
[03:01:12.020 --> 03:01:17.420]  need to know about what's happening well Alex the there was a kind of a red
[03:01:17.420 --> 03:01:21.340]  herring plow because everybody said that it was gonna be at the hotel
[03:01:21.340 --> 03:01:26.660]  Pinsky when we drove into town into San Maritz we drove directly past this
[03:01:26.660 --> 03:01:32.220]  hotel and in fact you can see it this hotel window as well and it was it was
[03:01:32.220 --> 03:01:36.540]  all shut down there was nobody there and that's what started the rumor in the
[03:01:36.540 --> 03:01:40.420]  first place because people had tried to tried to book rooms there for days
[03:01:40.420 --> 03:01:45.620]  during this Bilderberg conference and that was the kind of herring but they're
[03:01:45.620 --> 03:01:50.220]  actually way up on the hill a more secluded spot which is what you would
[03:01:50.220 --> 03:01:55.900]  expect because this capinsky hotel is right down basically just just outside
[03:01:55.900 --> 03:02:01.340]  the center of town so no surprise that it is up at the subretta hotel and not
[03:02:01.340 --> 03:02:09.900]  at the capinsky which is what many had reported beforehand any other points
[03:02:09.900 --> 03:02:17.900]  Paul no talker said about the Libya thing they're terrified of Congress
[03:02:17.900 --> 03:02:23.420]  stopping the bombing of Libya they want a gigantic war in the Middle East which
[03:02:23.420 --> 03:02:27.140]  is the same as what they said last year of course we know they're still concerned
[03:02:27.140 --> 03:02:33.100]  about the Greek debt situation and the euro we had Bilderberg at Kenneth
[03:02:33.100 --> 03:02:39.140]  Rogoff come out and say that if the Greek debt situation is allowed to spiral
[03:02:39.140 --> 03:02:44.660]  into crisis and if Greece defaults on its debt then that could place in peril
[03:02:44.660 --> 03:02:50.500]  the euro and in turn the global currency the regionalized currencies that the
[03:02:50.500 --> 03:02:55.460]  elite seek to implement so they're still very much concerned about the collapse
[03:02:55.460 --> 03:03:01.980]  of the euro and the breakup of the European Union the the newspaper one of
[03:03:01.980 --> 03:03:06.220]  the newspapers we purchased this afternoon talks about a Swiss energy
[03:03:06.220 --> 03:03:10.980]  minister attending the conference which is interesting because Switzerland has
[03:03:10.980 --> 03:03:17.460]  just agreed to decommission all its nuclear power plants by 2034 and this
[03:03:17.460 --> 03:03:24.380]  lady Lucard is a Swiss and a Doris Lucard she's a Swiss energy minister and
[03:03:24.380 --> 03:03:29.340]  she's been summoned to Bilderberg that's on the front page of the under tagged
[03:03:29.340 --> 03:03:34.940]  black newspaper so Bilderberg are obviously very concerned about the fact
[03:03:34.940 --> 03:03:38.700]  that they're you know their gender with nuclear power could be coming to an end
[03:03:38.700 --> 03:03:43.180]  and the aftermath of Fukushima so this summoned this energy minister well how
[03:03:43.180 --> 03:03:48.340]  how shameful is it that there's no coverage in the US media except for the
[03:03:48.340 --> 03:03:51.860]  drudge report linking to us on Monday I know drudge is waiting for our big
[03:03:51.860 --> 03:03:56.500]  reports with the inside Intel but those will be out soon so hopefully he'll
[03:03:56.500 --> 03:04:02.340]  help us break the electronic blockade the no information zone they've tried to
[03:04:02.340 --> 03:04:07.180]  set up here in the United States and so I'm Princess Leia drudge help me Obi-Wan
[03:04:07.180 --> 03:04:10.740]  drudge you're our only hope now folks all over the world are listening how
[03:04:10.740 --> 03:04:15.620]  exciting to think this idea for the mass protest on Saturday is Paul
[03:04:15.620 --> 03:04:19.420]  well it's big because to be frank there's not enough people there at the
[03:04:19.420 --> 03:04:24.540]  moment I mean it the Compton and actually started yet there and there were
[03:04:24.540 --> 03:04:28.820]  reports of a few members arriving but we didn't see much evidence of that there
[03:04:28.820 --> 03:04:32.980]  were you know the black cars in evidence but there were no passengers so
[03:04:32.980 --> 03:04:36.460]  this thing hasn't even begun to kick off so that's why people need to get down
[03:04:36.460 --> 03:04:41.140]  there and they still got time to do so absolutely we've got videos and audio
[03:04:41.140 --> 03:04:44.100]  being linked in our Twitter account twitter.com forward slash real items
[03:04:44.100 --> 03:04:48.340]  Jones please retweet everything we've got the big data page with the videos
