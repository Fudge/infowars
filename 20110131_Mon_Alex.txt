[00:00.000 --> 00:11.760]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.760 --> 00:19.320]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.320 --> 00:36.080]  Texas Alex Jones well it's the final day of the first month of 2011 January 31st
[00:36.080 --> 00:41.480]  2011 on this live Monday edition I can't think of a better time to have our
[00:41.480 --> 00:48.480]  regular guest and analyst Webster Tarpley joining us coming up in the second hour
[00:48.480 --> 00:54.720]  today and then the once a month visit of Max Kaiser on the rebellion popping up
[00:54.720 --> 01:01.560]  all over the Muslim world from Saudi Arabia through Jordan not just Tunisia
[01:01.560 --> 01:04.960]  with that government falling a week and a half ago and of course all of it
[01:04.960 --> 01:11.920]  centering in and around Egypt and also rebellions going on in Yemen and I don't
[01:11.920 --> 01:17.600]  default blame George Soros and the UN and the globalist for something until I see
[01:17.600 --> 01:21.800]  evidence and last Wednesday Thursday Friday I said look the people there are
[01:21.800 --> 01:29.240]  starving the people there have been under a dictator for 30 years and they're
[01:29.240 --> 01:33.800]  ripe for revolution and I just can't see why the globalist would want to remove
[01:33.800 --> 01:38.600]  Hossie Mubarak unless it's a strategy of tension to destabilize the whole
[01:38.600 --> 01:42.600]  region which we know they tried to do with Saddam Hussein the first time and
[01:42.600 --> 01:51.120]  succeeded the second time in 2003 first time in 1991 second time 2003 and so when
[01:51.120 --> 01:55.040]  they know a country is ripe for revolution the globalists know how to
[01:55.040 --> 01:59.640]  trigger it themselves to then come in and take over now I wasn't sure of that on
[01:59.640 --> 02:03.480]  Wednesday Thursday or Friday but by Friday evening I have the Associated
[02:03.480 --> 02:08.840]  Press the London Telegraph Egyptian newspapers and and now it's admitted
[02:08.840 --> 02:14.360]  that this Mohammed L. Baraday the former head of the UN atomic energy agency
[02:14.360 --> 02:23.120]  US trained heavily hooked him above CIA Davos Bilderberg you name it this guy is
[02:23.120 --> 02:27.000]  a complete globalist and now it's admitted he arrived a week before the
[02:27.000 --> 02:34.160]  demonstrations began and gave speeches about a rebellion and that the West again
[02:34.160 --> 02:38.120]  above our governments these these private banking think tank interlocking
[02:38.120 --> 02:44.640]  systems that control our governments are moving to run Hossie Mubarak out of
[02:44.640 --> 02:49.920]  Egypt and destabilize the entire country and now Zbigniew Brzezinski is
[02:49.920 --> 02:55.280]  basically calling for him to leave now the globalist admitted on Saturday we
[02:55.280 --> 02:59.840]  covered this on the Sunday show yesterday that well if they openly call for
[02:59.840 --> 03:06.160]  Hossie Mubarak to step down that then the anti-western and anti-Israel fervor
[03:06.160 --> 03:13.240]  would shift against the West and in favor of Hossie Mubarak and so they're
[03:13.240 --> 03:16.960]  organizing the rebellion in the streets triggering a powder keg that was
[03:16.960 --> 03:21.120]  already there and legitimately angry but then publicly backing off and
[03:21.120 --> 03:27.720]  supporting Hossie Mubarak the dictator so that he won't get support from the
[03:27.720 --> 03:33.760]  population waking up to the fact that a new puppet is being brought in and I
[03:33.760 --> 03:37.840]  have to say on Wednesday of last week we published a tarply article at info
[03:37.840 --> 03:41.960]  wars.com that basically said all this I said on air I wasn't sure if that was
[03:41.960 --> 03:50.640]  correct but now it's just admitted that Muhammad El Baradi was there stirring it
[03:50.640 --> 03:55.680]  all up and is completely backed by the financial dictatorship that runs our
[03:55.680 --> 03:59.880]  country and much of the Western world here's the London Telegraph Egypt
[03:59.880 --> 04:05.080]  protest America's secret backing of rebel leaders behind uprising and they
[04:05.080 --> 04:12.080]  don't just have they don't just have Muhammad El Baradi under their wing
[04:12.080 --> 04:17.080]  they've got two or three or even four depending on the country layers of all
[04:17.080 --> 04:22.320]  the opposition on their payroll so if he gets in they rebel more and don't like
[04:22.320 --> 04:25.280]  it it sometimes happens with these over throws you could have two or three
[04:25.280 --> 04:29.840]  presidents or prime ministers in the space of a week or a month sometimes
[04:29.840 --> 04:35.760]  a year it varies to where more shark teeth will just roll forward just
[04:35.760 --> 04:39.680]  absolutely incredible and the Muslim Brotherhood known British slash
[04:39.680 --> 04:45.160]  Israeli intelligence you know called radical Muslims by the media there
[04:45.160 --> 04:49.320]  meanwhile running around trying to overthrow another globalist ally that's
[04:49.320 --> 04:55.440]  Jordan the protest has flared up all over Saudi Arabia we're gonna talk about
[04:55.440 --> 04:59.000]  where this is going geopolitically look at the economy here and the internet

[05:02.440 --> 05:07.280]  recently that the recession is over it ended on June of 2009 the millions of
[05:07.280 --> 05:11.800]  Americans unable to find work might not agree perhaps a recession ended for the
[05:11.800 --> 05:15.200]  bankers and government employees but for the rest of us things seem to be
[05:15.200 --> 05:18.920]  getting worse gold and silver haven't heard the news either they've begun

[08:49.200 --> 08:54.760]  want to comment on what their view is of the entire Middle Eastern North Africa
[08:54.760 --> 09:01.600]  situation with blow-ups now happening in Jordan Saudi Arabia Yemen obviously
[09:01.600 --> 09:07.080]  Egypt and of course Tunisia that fell to a new government just a few weeks ago
[09:07.080 --> 09:13.040]  and in every one of these cases the West is bragging out of one side of their
[09:13.040 --> 09:18.560]  mouth the George Soros Davos Switzerland type crowd this is even above
[09:18.560 --> 09:24.280]  government the big banking cartels the Ponzi scheme operators that are been so
[09:24.280 --> 09:28.640]  successful they've taken the planet over through fraud they are openly bragging
[09:28.640 --> 09:32.520]  all over the news that they have engineered this and I just you know
[09:32.520 --> 09:37.800]  don't go with their their crowing statements I actually went and did with
[09:37.800 --> 09:43.040]  obviously research on Muhammad L. Barrity and on the leaders of the Muslim
[09:43.040 --> 09:50.120]  Brotherhood and others and they are all openly globalist of course with
[09:50.120 --> 09:53.600]  Barrity there's no secret the former head of the atomic energy agency at the
[09:53.600 --> 09:59.360]  U.N. trained at prestigious schools the United States Davos Bilderberg group
[09:59.360 --> 10:06.800]  attendee clearly this is their new man for Egypt even though Hosni Mubarak set
[10:06.800 --> 10:12.000]  up the torture camps the secret arrest centers people worldwide flown in there
[10:12.000 --> 10:16.120]  to be brutally tortured their children to be tortured and even sexually abused
[10:16.120 --> 10:21.120]  in front of them the CIA bragged in 2002 to the Washington Post that they were
[10:21.120 --> 10:25.120]  torturing kids in front of their parents in Egypt I mean this is who runs our
[10:25.120 --> 10:29.080]  government offshore banks who were totally and completely ruthless and
[10:29.080 --> 10:33.360]  stabbed their minion Saddam Hussein in the back stabbed their minion Hosni
[10:33.360 --> 10:37.560]  Mubarak in the back they stab everyone in the back and the globalist are
[10:37.560 --> 10:44.120]  stabbing America in the back China devalues their currency as a tariff so
[10:44.120 --> 10:48.200]  that we can't compete plus they have no environmental standards and sell us junk
[10:48.200 --> 10:53.160]  the World Trade Organization rules against us in every case with China
[10:53.160 --> 10:57.960]  that's the big central banks stabbing us in the back for their darling
[10:57.960 --> 11:03.160]  dictatorship in China this is the globalist master plan play nations off
[11:03.160 --> 11:07.680]  against each other to make every nation on earth weak and the big mega central
[11:07.680 --> 11:14.280]  banks strong now that said while we're busy watching what's happening in the
[11:14.280 --> 11:18.560]  Middle East and North Africa and we're going to be going over all of that
[11:18.560 --> 11:27.560]  today PC world the age and others are all reporting that they are trying now
[11:27.560 --> 11:33.560]  to finish completion of the Internet kill system and these are giant grids at
[11:33.560 --> 11:37.640]  AT&T and all the other major telecommunications companies that already
[11:37.640 --> 11:42.800]  have NSA snooping hubs built into them in many cases entire buildings that have
[11:42.800 --> 11:47.360]  been built on or entire floors that's all part of the public record and now
[11:47.360 --> 11:51.960]  they're hard-wiring giant snooping systems to expand the snooping and to
[11:51.960 --> 11:57.560]  analyze encrypted packets and to analyze obviously societal and business
[11:57.560 --> 12:03.240]  trends to be fed back to the globalist and to shut the internet off entirely
[12:03.240 --> 12:08.400]  crippling our society one way they can launch this is claiming that there's
[12:08.400 --> 12:15.680]  been a internet cyber attack another way that the globalist can do this is to
[12:15.680 --> 12:19.600]  claim that they're protecting us from a cyber attack and had to shut it off
[12:19.600 --> 12:25.120]  again a they can attack the system claim its outsiders bring the system down
[12:25.120 --> 12:29.880]  and then use that as an excuse to bring in even more control in the name of
[12:29.880 --> 12:35.240]  protecting it and that is more along their modus operandi but they like to
[12:35.240 --> 12:40.000]  change it up they can also run an outside attack and claim they're shutting
[12:40.000 --> 12:43.440]  the web off to protect critical infrastructure they've publicly put
[12:43.440 --> 12:47.480]  out those trial balloons and said that's reasons they may do this or they may
[12:47.480 --> 12:54.800]  just piecemeal with the internet ID the internet taxes and the local hubs that
[12:54.800 --> 12:58.320]  they're demanding under the cyber security act be put into place so that
[12:58.320 --> 13:03.160]  even if you try to set up local city or even neighborhood networks by law they
[13:03.160 --> 13:08.280]  will jam and block those also they're recruiting through the see something
[13:08.280 --> 13:14.720]  say something in regard system as a subdivision of secure core itself a
[13:14.720 --> 13:20.200]  subgroup of AmeriCorps and the jobs to work programs are openly announcing
[13:20.200 --> 13:25.200]  that they are going to recruit in mass high schoolers and college students to
[13:25.200 --> 13:29.480]  man the giant cyber security systems that they're building nationwide and
[13:29.480 --> 13:35.320]  giant NSA command bases that will spy subvert post counter propaganda in their
[13:35.320 --> 13:40.720]  words that is openly trolling posting on message boards putting out this
[13:40.720 --> 13:49.520]  information something sent com for eight years admits they're already doing we've
[13:49.520 --> 13:53.320]  also got developments coming up later dealing with now more than 40 states
[13:53.320 --> 13:58.640]  filing lawsuits against government takeover of health care and it's also
[13:58.640 --> 14:06.040]  come out in the news today that not only is Obama giving over now 500 businesses
[14:06.040 --> 14:10.720]  including McDonald's franchise waivers from government health care meaning it's
[14:10.720 --> 14:13.960]  an unfair trade advantage against their competition that must purchase health
[14:13.960 --> 14:19.680]  care but now he's giving the Congress waivers and other federal employees
[14:19.680 --> 14:24.360]  that's in the Washington Times we're going to be covering that as well today
[14:24.360 --> 14:30.200]  also on the economic front I've told you that the highest interest rates were
[14:30.200 --> 14:38.000]  35% on credit cards that's now changed the APR is now 59.9 this is what the
[14:38.000 --> 14:41.640]  big central banks are doing with the banker bailout money we back it up as
[14:41.640 --> 14:45.840]  taxpayers give it to them with zero interest they then leverage it to
[14:45.840 --> 14:53.800]  infinity and loan it out on average at 14.72 and as high as 59.9 CNN reporting
[14:53.800 --> 15:00.320]  that course up until a few years ago it was illegal to charge more than 30% now
[15:00.320 --> 15:06.120]  they're going directly to loan sharking rates of 59.9 loan sharking
[15:06.120 --> 15:10.000]  historically has been about 25 but they let them go up to 30 now they've changed
[15:10.000 --> 15:15.480]  the law as part of credit card reform to allow it to be unlimited that's how they
[15:15.480 --> 15:25.880]  reform things to help you out oh man who the order has gone out to just have
[15:25.880 --> 15:29.360]  unlimited tyranny upon the American people but getting back to Egypt and how
[15:29.360 --> 15:34.840]  it bounces back to the US Europe's put the kill switches in the kill switches
[15:34.840 --> 15:39.080]  are now in in the US they're getting everybody ready for a cyber attack at
[15:39.080 --> 15:43.200]  the 9,000 locations with the telescreens one of the announcements is the
[15:43.200 --> 15:47.160]  head of cybersecurity that hasn't even gotten cabinet funding yet hasn't been
[15:47.160 --> 15:51.000]  passed by Congress but is in place saying the internet's under attack
[15:51.000 --> 15:54.240]  terrorists are about to hit it the internet's not safe we're trying to
[15:54.240 --> 15:58.640]  protect it report bad things on the internet to police just all part of a
[15:58.640 --> 16:03.160]  hysteria then they walk out front see a guy on the cell phone it turns into a
[16:03.160 --> 16:07.720]  gun they call SWAT teams it's all part of just the mental illness fleeing when
[16:07.720 --> 16:12.400]  none pursue it ignoring all the real crime all the real terror all the real
[16:12.400 --> 16:17.760]  corruption and only focusing in on seeing phantoms in and around your
[16:17.760 --> 16:24.480]  neighborhood but continuing here as Egypt goes offline US gets internet
[16:24.480 --> 16:29.120]  kill switch bill ready this is out of the age in Australia as Egypt's government
[16:29.120 --> 16:32.760]  attempts to crack down on street protesters by shutting down internet
[16:32.760 --> 16:36.280]  and mobile phone services and that's what this is really for see they know
[16:36.280 --> 16:39.680]  they're going in to the end of the American way the end of the American
[16:39.680 --> 16:44.320]  way of life the end of liberty the end of wealth the end of the engine of
[16:44.320 --> 16:49.160]  everything good this is all by design the post industrial us we're going into
[16:49.160 --> 16:52.960]  bondage and so they've got it just like with Egypt they've got to have the grid
[16:52.960 --> 16:59.320]  in place and it's not to stop al-qaeda or the Chinese from attacking us via
[16:59.320 --> 17:04.040]  cyber it's about shutting down the internet when they have the bank holiday
[17:04.040 --> 17:08.480]  when they devalue your currency or when they completely take your pension fund
[17:08.480 --> 17:11.520]  they've already taken most the veterans pension funds and their death
[17:11.520 --> 17:17.840]  benefits Bloomberg AP the skies the limit they've trained local spy groups
[17:17.840 --> 17:21.640]  they've trained the police to hate the American people they've trained them to
[17:21.640 --> 17:27.800]  eat their own guts and ask for seconds we are the enemy the Marine Corps doesn't
[17:27.800 --> 17:32.160]  run and do chance about killing commies for mommy they do chance about killing

[22:10.760 --> 22:15.000]  through their own words and documents the new world order really is a tool for
[22:15.000 --> 22:19.040]  addressing a new world of possibilities it means all the world under their
[22:19.040 --> 22:23.800]  control the United Nations would take over America the Trilateral Commission
[22:23.800 --> 22:28.360]  would control the world invisible Empire Chronicles how men of power and
[22:28.360 --> 22:31.960]  influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive
[22:31.960 --> 22:36.240]  world government I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a
[22:36.240 --> 22:39.960]  world constitution for the global financial system global governance with
[22:39.960 --> 22:44.240]  the establishment of the G20 so it's gonna be an inner ruling elite and then

[23:00.880 --> 23:04.600]  the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults
[23:04.600 --> 23:08.440]  near the Arctic Circle did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds
[23:08.440 --> 23:12.080]  could become more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds that all perform
[23:12.080 --> 23:15.120]  even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could
[23:15.120 --> 23:18.960]  even happen again so our friends at Solutions from Science have put together
[23:18.960 --> 23:24.360]  the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it can
[23:24.360 --> 23:28.520]  produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family
[23:28.520 --> 23:32.160]  and here's the best part these seeds have not been genetically modified in any
[23:32.160 --> 23:36.640]  way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden so
[23:36.640 --> 23:42.200]  visit them today at survivalseedbank.com that's survivalseedbank.com or give
[23:42.200 --> 23:52.000]  them a call at 877-327-0365 that's 877-327-0365 remember in a real
[23:52.000 --> 23:56.680]  crisis non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item this is Alex Jones for
[23:56.680 --> 23:59.840]  survivalseedbank.com
[24:06.680 --> 24:11.920]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. we are here live thank you so much
[24:11.920 --> 24:17.960]  for joining us you know I'm not trying to be negative but Hitler killing tens of
[24:17.960 --> 24:24.080]  millions Stalin killing tens of millions Lenin killing tens of millions
[24:24.080 --> 24:30.000]  Mao Pol Pot the list goes on and on think about Stalin killing
[24:30.000 --> 24:35.120]  conservatively 35 million people conservatively 60 million under Mao and
[24:35.120 --> 24:39.560]  our government our so-called government is now on record admitting they helped
[24:39.560 --> 24:43.880]  put Mao into power and David Rockefeller and all these other globalists write
[24:43.880 --> 24:50.720]  articles and books about how great he was and how we need that system think of a
[24:50.720 --> 24:59.360]  million dead that's 10 sports stadiums with 100,000 each men women children
[24:59.360 --> 25:07.040]  little babies killed think of 64 million that's the conservative estimate that
[25:07.040 --> 25:15.800]  Mao killed 64 million murdered now if that isn't black cup of abomination if
[25:15.800 --> 25:21.360]  that isn't total degradation think about 51 million people dead how many
[25:21.360 --> 25:28.400]  sports stadiums is that how many sports stadiums filled with a hundred
[25:28.400 --> 25:36.560]  thousand people is 51 million that's how many babies didn't get to get born in
[25:36.560 --> 25:42.280]  America so see all this death that goes on around us and so we're shocked when
[25:42.280 --> 25:46.520]  tyranny starts wearing its head we're shocked that the federal government
[25:46.520 --> 25:51.360]  would sign secret deals 11 years ago to begin stealing the death benefits of
[25:51.360 --> 25:57.160]  US troops as they die of course they're gonna get away with that if they can
[25:57.160 --> 26:00.840]  steal tens of trillions of dollars and then Congress says where's the money
[26:00.840 --> 26:05.360]  going Federal Reserve and they say we're not gonna tell you and the former Fed
[26:05.360 --> 26:11.560]  head goes on Lair News Hour and says we're above the law nobody can touch us
[26:11.560 --> 26:18.720]  or investigate us because they say so because they're wearing a suit is there
[26:18.720 --> 26:25.120]  nothing we won't put up with is there no level of humiliation my words can't
[26:25.120 --> 26:28.960]  describe what's been set up the banks that have run the world for the last
[26:28.960 --> 26:34.520]  70 years conservatively have funded dictators have funded wars have funded
[26:34.520 --> 26:38.920]  both sides of conflicts and they're bringing a hellish system in and then
[26:38.920 --> 26:44.000]  they admit all over the news that these big financial interests that run our
[26:44.000 --> 26:48.920]  country are overthrowing Hosni Mubarak to bring in another guy involved in
[26:48.920 --> 26:59.440]  torture and corruption another guy involved in all of this persecution they
[26:59.440 --> 27:03.160]  got rid of Saddam and brought in more tyranny it's actually accelerated now
[27:03.160 --> 27:07.960]  that Saddam Hussein is gone they want it to be bad they want to destroy these
[27:07.960 --> 27:13.760]  countries they want you on your belly starving they want you and myself and
[27:13.760 --> 27:18.040]  everybody else dead that's their end game they want us gone they've bought up
[27:18.040 --> 27:22.600]  the world through fraud and they are tired of looking at us I want to go to
[27:22.600 --> 27:26.520]  this clip and then go to break and come back but this is a big to presence key
[27:26.520 --> 27:35.280]  on ABC news last night openly saying that he wants
[27:35.280 --> 27:40.080]  Hosni Mubarak to step down now here's the Brzezinski model this is one of the
[27:40.080 --> 27:44.040]  architects of these type of color revolutions against the globalist own
[27:44.040 --> 27:49.040]  ally Hosni Mubarak here it is we're joined now by a man who has helped
[27:49.040 --> 27:53.840]  navigate US foreign policy way back during the Iranian revolution he is
[27:53.840 --> 27:57.400]  Big Mief Brzezinski who used to be president Carter's national security
[27:57.400 --> 28:01.760]  advisor joins us now thank you for being with us I want to start by asking you
[28:01.760 --> 28:07.320]  does Mubarak have to go or as the administration seems to hope he can
[28:07.320 --> 28:12.480]  implement enough reforms to get through this moment is that realistic I don't
[28:12.480 --> 28:18.000]  think that's realistic what could be a realistic is that Mubarak himself
[28:18.000 --> 28:25.000]  becomes convinced with outside advice that it is in his interest as well as in
[28:25.000 --> 28:30.320]  Egypt's interest that he goes and that he sets in motion a process which
[28:30.320 --> 28:34.920]  facilitates that I think the alternatives otherwise are much tougher
[28:34.920 --> 28:40.120]  either the army cracks down and the populace increasingly turns to
[28:40.120 --> 28:45.000]  fundamentalism radicalism in reaction to the crackdown or the regime
[28:45.000 --> 28:49.480]  perpetuates itself and an explosion comes later and even more violent okay
[28:49.480 --> 28:54.800]  and it goes on from there notice how they fed the sounds of rioting and
[28:54.800 --> 28:59.520]  chanting that reminds me in Chicago last week said to make everybody happier
[28:59.520 --> 29:04.080]  they're gonna put up broadcasting towers that play the sound of tweeting and
[29:04.080 --> 29:11.040]  singing and chirping birds see the mindset is we're creatures in a
[29:11.040 --> 29:16.320]  laboratory we're creatures on a slide in a Petri dish and they're the social
[29:16.320 --> 29:21.160]  engineers manipulating us but exactly as I said Sunday once they began to admit
[29:21.160 --> 29:24.760]  that they were orchestrating this the globalist that they knew that there was
[29:24.760 --> 29:31.440]  a trigger coming for true freedom in Egypt and so they sent their globalist
[29:31.440 --> 29:35.040]  stooge in with money and macking to go ahead and overthrow their old
[29:35.040 --> 29:41.720]  apprentice their old puppet out count Dooku or hazy Mubarak and they're gonna
[29:41.720 --> 29:47.200]  replace him with Darth Vader Muhammad L. Barrity you want to use a Star Wars
[29:47.200 --> 29:53.480]  analogy we'll be right back stay with us we're on the March the Empire's on the
[29:53.480 --> 30:02.200]  run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network this is Alex Jones with five good
[30:02.200 --> 30:06.200]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new
[30:06.200 --> 30:10.000]  climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[30:10.000 --> 30:14.080]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[30:14.080 --> 30:18.320]  allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the
[30:18.320 --> 30:22.600]  name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[30:22.600 --> 30:26.560]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[30:26.560 --> 30:30.960]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is
[30:30.960 --> 30:34.680]  always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[30:34.680 --> 30:38.800]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[30:38.800 --> 30:42.640]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar
[30:42.640 --> 30:46.120]  power generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors
[30:46.120 --> 30:52.800]  you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com remember
[30:52.800 --> 31:00.760]  the government doesn't own the Sun so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365
[31:00.760 --> 31:05.840]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[31:05.840 --> 31:11.400]  is our last chance to not relive history is it finishing off this agenda they'll
[31:11.400 --> 31:16.440]  be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I have tremendous influence on our
[31:16.440 --> 31:20.640]  president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I think it's
[31:20.640 --> 31:25.880]  incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for the
[31:25.880 --> 31:31.040]  republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel held
[31:31.040 --> 31:35.400]  bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government
[31:35.400 --> 31:39.560]  Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more matches and the
[31:39.560 --> 31:43.240]  Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does
[31:43.240 --> 31:49.240]  care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic get

[32:07.440 --> 32:11.120]  and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the
[32:11.120 --> 32:16.000]  bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs the respiratory system
[32:16.000 --> 32:20.000]  is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses the silver
[32:20.000 --> 32:24.560]  lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano
[32:24.560 --> 32:29.800]  silver solutions and also delivers the silver nano particles instantly into
[32:29.800 --> 32:33.480]  the bloodstream with continued legislation threatening the sale of
[32:33.480 --> 32:38.800]  nano silver products you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with
[32:38.800 --> 32:43.160]  the silver lungs generator very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are
[32:43.160 --> 32:49.480]  provided making production fast and simple go to www.silverlungs.com today
[32:49.480 --> 32:53.160]  and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the silver lungs generator
[32:53.160 --> 33:06.080]  that's www.silverlungs.com
[33:06.080 --> 33:11.920]  devastating globalist lies exposing the mainstream media's propaganda
[33:11.920 --> 33:17.720]  machine tirelessly waging war on corruption from deep in the heart of
[33:17.720 --> 33:24.160]  fema region six in Austin Texas transmitting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[33:24.160 --> 33:31.240]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[33:32.560 --> 33:39.400]  we see the earth right here the private banking cartel playing nations races
[33:39.400 --> 33:45.640]  religions off against each other they then pose as the arbiter or the
[33:45.640 --> 33:52.520]  referee and the financiers to fix the crises that they create or that they
[33:52.520 --> 34:02.920]  energize and so by Saturday and then by Sunday it became it began to become
[34:02.920 --> 34:10.800]  completely absolutely clear that the establishment knew that Egypt was on the
[34:10.800 --> 34:17.840]  edge of revolt because the IMF and oral bank in the last year had ordered them
[34:17.840 --> 34:23.880]  to institute austerity measures right at half their population making under $2 a
[34:23.880 --> 34:31.280]  day many of their people starving or malnourished the UN coming in saying
[34:31.280 --> 34:35.400]  they'd give them more money if they engaged in sterilization and abortion
[34:35.400 --> 34:39.600]  that's been a big fight and Hosni Mubarak could not even though he's a
[34:39.600 --> 34:44.560]  dictator he could not force that on the Egyptians so the globalist have blocked
[34:44.560 --> 34:48.200]  Egypt from industrializing which would have caused them to stop having as many
[34:48.200 --> 34:53.320]  children that the globalist think is so dangerous and so while blocking their
[34:53.320 --> 34:57.880]  development which then triggers larger populations in every case then they come
[34:57.880 --> 35:02.720]  in and demand that the abortion and the other eugenics operations be carried out
[35:02.720 --> 35:07.400]  and that's clearly one of the main reasons the UN has been critical of the
[35:07.400 --> 35:13.040]  regime in their 20 years of demands that they get busy killing their people like
[35:13.040 --> 35:20.240]  China has done so extremely serious situation there and so they know that
[35:20.240 --> 35:25.040]  the people were about to rebel and take their nation back that scene is radical
[35:25.040 --> 35:32.680]  can't actually have a Middle Eastern country run by the people and so in comes
[35:32.680 --> 35:40.440]  this Mohammed al-Baraday top globalist top UN minion top eugenicist to carry
[35:40.440 --> 35:46.360]  out that operation but then the US has to tacitly approve of Hosni Mubarak so
[35:46.360 --> 35:50.680]  the population doesn't wake up to what's happening and actually give Mubarak
[35:50.680 --> 35:55.960]  support once they realize that that's the dictator now out of favor with the
[35:55.960 --> 35:59.720]  New World Order and undoubtedly what they're about to get is going to be a
[35:59.720 --> 36:04.400]  lot worse so the globalist put gas on the fire fuel on the fire
[36:04.400 --> 36:11.360]  accelerant on the blaze by making them cut the food allowances that again right
[36:11.360 --> 36:18.080]  at half the population is surviving on and so you see millions of very lean
[36:18.080 --> 36:24.640]  people on the verge of starvation malnutrition epidemic hitting the
[36:24.640 --> 36:31.280]  streets for food and don't worry the man on the white horse arrives Mohammed
[36:31.280 --> 36:36.520]  al-Baraday he will save you and the Muslim brotherhood that I hear neocons
[36:36.520 --> 36:41.000]  talking about being radical Muslims that want to get us admittedly run by
[36:41.000 --> 36:45.480]  British Israeli and US intelligence trying now to overthrow Saudi Arabia
[36:45.480 --> 36:48.000]  openly the head of the Muslim brotherhood saying they're going to
[36:48.000 --> 36:55.040]  overthrow Jordan the big ally because they don't want Jordan with factories
[36:55.040 --> 37:01.000]  and hotels and fighter jets and friendly royalty and an elite wearing
[37:01.000 --> 37:06.960]  Armani suits and you know women sipping Coca-Cola on the on the street
[37:06.960 --> 37:12.520]  corners at the cafes they want them like Iraq truck bombings guys running
[37:12.520 --> 37:17.040]  around with you know hoods on their heads screaming Allah Akbar blowing up
[37:17.040 --> 37:23.320]  Shiites and Sunnis killing each other the grand chessboard destruction you
[37:23.320 --> 37:27.160]  cannot serve the New World Order you cannot lick their boots and have them
[37:27.160 --> 37:32.120]  leave you alone anyone who can stand anyone who can tie their shoelaces is
[37:32.120 --> 37:37.760]  an enemy of the New World Order including America we're taught to have this
[37:37.760 --> 37:42.320]  lustful hate of the Muslims while Western governments bring them in as
[37:42.320 --> 37:47.960]  fast as they can while the tax-free foundations Carnegie Rockefeller and
[37:47.960 --> 37:53.240]  other endowments Ford fund the radical Muslims fund the liberation theology
[37:53.240 --> 38:00.040]  find the jihad fund the takeover in the prisons which are giant education
[38:00.040 --> 38:05.120]  centers for the Muslims to take over they are creating that foreign enemy and
[38:05.120 --> 38:10.880]  then offering their solution just as they fund the Hispanic liberation the
[38:10.880 --> 38:14.320]  black liberation just as the FBI has been caught and the southern property
[38:14.320 --> 38:19.040]  law center and others running and infiltrating and and controlling the
[38:19.040 --> 38:23.200]  white supremacist and that's why the white supremacist whether they know it
[38:23.200 --> 38:27.520]  or not some are useful idiots at the bottom hate this show so much because I
[38:27.520 --> 38:31.840]  call them out when it constantly gets revealed in lawsuits and court hearings
[38:31.840 --> 38:37.840]  that in every case the commanders the leaders of the Aryan nations the
[38:37.840 --> 38:43.840]  commanders the leaders of the white supremacist of the clan of the Elohim
[38:43.840 --> 38:49.800]  city of these marches through minority areas of cities they're not infiltrated
[38:49.800 --> 38:54.680]  by feds they are run by feds to make us fight with each other
[38:54.680 --> 39:01.640]  Metsha LaRaza Ku Klux Klan Aryan nations Hal Turner all of it to get us at
[39:01.640 --> 39:06.880]  each other's throats while the New World Order brings in its tyranny it's called
[39:06.880 --> 39:13.280]  Balkanization divide and conquer now I listened to local radio this morning
[39:13.280 --> 39:19.320]  local AM then I listened to local FM then I listened to national AM then I
[39:19.320 --> 39:23.280]  checked the news listings for about three hours scanning back and forth and I
[39:23.280 --> 39:30.400]  heard this big demonization of Hosni Mubarak because he did an internet
[39:30.400 --> 39:34.000]  kill switch and shut the web off and certainly I mean what do you think a
[39:34.000 --> 39:39.960]  dictator now in his hitlerian bunker as their spiegel points out surrounded on
[39:39.960 --> 39:44.560]  all sides what do you think he's going to do but none of them want to talk
[39:44.560 --> 39:50.480]  about the internet kill switch our government has already constructed and
[39:50.480 --> 39:56.160]  has already built as Egypt goes offline u.s. gets internet kill switch bill
[39:56.160 --> 40:01.880]  ready the age Sydney Morning Herald some reason the Australians are big on this
[40:01.880 --> 40:07.800]  PC world they're all reporting on it oh but I don't hear those talk show hosts
[40:07.800 --> 40:11.920]  crying out against that like a lot of conservatives agree we need this because
[40:11.920 --> 40:17.680]  of Al Qaeda yes and then they launch an attack on the web say Al Qaeda did it
[40:17.680 --> 40:21.560]  shut the web down for a time and when they roll out the new web it's got all
[40:21.560 --> 40:26.560]  the controls in place that are already there a nice false flag on our liberty
[40:26.560 --> 40:30.520]  and they'll have the average liberal and conservative on talk radio on TV
[40:30.520 --> 40:35.960]  cheering we're not going to let Al Qaeda win we've got a new unfree internet that
[40:35.960 --> 40:42.160]  will keep us safe we've got to have this internet for commerce as Egypt's
[40:42.160 --> 40:45.120]  government attempts to crack down on street protests by shutting down
[40:45.120 --> 40:49.040]  internet and mobile phone services the u.s. is preparing to reintroduce a bill
[40:49.040 --> 40:53.640]  that could be used to shut down the internet yeah I've got Lieberman J
[40:53.640 --> 40:58.000]  Rockefeller Obama all saying well China's got it we need to be able to shut
[40:58.000 --> 41:03.120]  the web off to protect it during a Chinese attack or an Al Qaeda attack oh
[41:03.120 --> 41:09.520]  yes oh oh oh then they line say oh they can shut off red lights so they can shut
[41:09.520 --> 41:14.440]  off respirators none of that by law can be hooked into the internet oh you can
[41:14.440 --> 41:17.960]  go up to a terminal on the side of the road and reprogram a sign if you've got
[41:17.960 --> 41:24.760]  the skills one sign you cannot it's on its own network it was initially
[41:24.760 --> 41:28.520]  introduced last year but expired with a new Congress yeah they say the terrorists
[41:28.520 --> 41:32.400]  are gonna make the nuclear reactors go off really when the US and Israel made
[41:32.400 --> 41:38.560]  the Stuxnet three months ago it a spy had to put it in with a thumb drive into
[41:38.560 --> 41:44.240]  the computer and into every piece of equipment that was separated globalist
[41:44.240 --> 41:49.320]  spies had to load it directly in because it wasn't hooked to the internet
[41:49.320 --> 41:56.040]  even in Iran oh but then our media said we've got to give up our internet
[41:56.040 --> 42:00.240]  freedom and have the kill switch because of Stuxnet that happened right as they
[42:00.240 --> 42:03.880]  were lobbying to pass it and then they later admit our own government with
[42:03.880 --> 42:09.280]  Israel launches the Stuxnet that bounces back on our countries in the west and
[42:09.280 --> 42:13.080]  then they have no shame they say we've got to take over the internet to stop
[42:13.080 --> 42:18.000]  Stuxnet we've got to take your liberty because of Stuxnet that the terrorists
[42:18.000 --> 42:23.640]  launched and they go by the way we launched it as if common sense doesn't
[42:23.640 --> 42:29.940]  exist with the childlike servile public and I'm talking about that group in the
[42:29.940 --> 42:36.160]  public that is servile and crouches down to lick the tyrannical hand of the New
[42:36.160 --> 42:41.640]  World Order that loves it that lives to grovel lives to sound like second grade
[42:41.640 --> 42:47.240]  children gibbering on talk radio filled with ignorance repeating the false
[42:47.240 --> 42:53.000]  paradigm information they downloaded it was initially introduced last year but
[42:53.000 --> 42:56.880]  expired with the new congress senator Susan Collins a cosponsor the bill so
[42:56.880 --> 43:00.400]  that unlike Egypt where the government was using its powers to quell dissent by
[43:00.400 --> 43:04.680]  shutting down the internet it would not really the administration admits they
[43:04.680 --> 43:08.960]  want to use it for that in the White House science are and the regulations are
[43:08.960 --> 43:11.720]  and others have called for restricting people that disagree with the
[43:11.720 --> 43:19.080]  globalist so has the FCC commissioner so has other members of the FCC board I
[43:19.080 --> 43:23.440]  mean you haven't heard the countless members of Congress calling for total
[43:23.440 --> 43:28.200]  censorship of free speech in America what rock are you hiding under Collins oh
[43:28.200 --> 43:33.640]  let us turn the web off and have the power but I promise I promise I promise
[43:33.640 --> 43:38.160]  we're the government we don't lie my legislation will provide a mechanism for
[43:38.160 --> 43:41.600]  the government to work with private sector that means take it over you ought
[43:41.600 --> 43:46.280]  to read the cyber security act in the event of a true cyber emergency yeah
[43:46.280 --> 43:52.160]  mm-hmm Collins said in an emailed statement to wired it would give our
[43:52.160 --> 43:56.240]  nation the best tools available to swiftly respond to a significant threat
[43:56.240 --> 44:01.320]  exactly the banks only got unlimited trillions with the banker bailout to
[44:01.320 --> 44:05.840]  save us from the bad financial decisions that weren't bad for them that they put
[44:05.840 --> 44:10.000]  in place with Glass-Steagall being removed they create the crisis think we
[44:10.000 --> 44:17.520]  have no memory and offer the solution here's wired communicate if your
[44:17.520 --> 44:20.920]  government shuts off your internet
[44:24.400 --> 44:28.360]  and what else did Egypt doing that I'm going to your calls they arrested
[44:28.360 --> 44:35.760]  people in mass opposition across the board and members of Al Jazeera saying
[44:35.760 --> 44:39.560]  that their British intelligence of course Mubarak always knew knew that
[44:39.560 --> 44:43.800]  because you know he works partially for British intelligence it's kind of the
[44:43.800 --> 44:53.720]  trifecta the US Israel and England all like triple Siamese triplets and that's
[44:53.720 --> 45:00.200]  what they're doing and of course they arrested Al Jazeera I mean it's come
[45:00.200 --> 45:04.600]  out that MSNBC CNN all of them are completely government funded your your
[45:04.600 --> 45:10.440]  tax money goes through the subsidiaries to them we have state-run media but they
[45:10.440 --> 45:13.960]  always thought they could ignore shows like mine and the alternative media but
[45:13.960 --> 45:17.440]  now that we're rivaling them they're openly licking their lips saying they
[45:17.440 --> 45:21.400]  want to start shutting us down and you notice Mubarak arrested the media the
[45:21.400 --> 45:28.520]  foreign media Mubarak has arrested all the opposition groups leadership they
[45:28.520 --> 45:31.880]  sent army trucks around everybody's house to arrest tens of thousands of
[45:31.880 --> 45:36.520]  people what do you think they're training the army to do here I've been to
[45:36.520 --> 45:42.240]  the drills to drive around including picking up city council members preachers
[45:42.240 --> 45:48.560]  even people that have served them even people that have served them they've
[45:48.560 --> 45:53.200]  done psychological assessments on them or maybe the local government operative
[45:53.200 --> 45:59.320]  doesn't like you so they put you on the list so you go to a FEMA dungeon and of
[45:59.320 --> 46:03.800]  course you've got to be inoculated for your own safety they train for that you

[46:13.120 --> 46:17.720]  compartmentalized contractors and they strap you down to that gurney and they
[46:17.720 --> 46:23.560]  start taking a ball peen hammer and just smashing your fingers off oh and
[46:23.560 --> 46:26.200]  they've been trained by the thousands maybe they take your kids in and start
[46:26.200 --> 46:29.000]  raping them in front of you and they take acid and pour it all over your
[46:29.000 --> 46:36.920]  children that's your loving USA USA that's who runs our country the same
[46:36.920 --> 46:41.560]  ones that funded mubarak to do all of that general to goomba's army report

[46:49.680 --> 46:56.320]  army report on torture type that in of course general to goomba got a little
[46:56.320 --> 47:03.600]  trouble after he released that US general oh but that we had to do it to
[47:03.600 --> 47:08.880]  fight the terrorist they might get us if we don't now they were forging an army
[47:08.880 --> 47:13.880]  of hell they were forging an army of satanic dungeon keepers to be released
[47:13.880 --> 47:19.160]  on us in a trade larger cadres look I'm not trying to scare you this is the
[47:19.160 --> 47:25.400]  evil that we have created Zabignan Brzezinski who I played earlier bragged
[47:25.400 --> 47:34.080]  in two books that he wrote that he funded pole pot and pole pot killed 30
[47:34.080 --> 47:39.720]  million people and he's proud of that to the globalist you are honored when you
[47:39.720 --> 47:44.480]  kill you are honored with the more skulls you have hanging around you know
[47:44.480 --> 47:52.440]  the chains that bind their wicked souls they love it they live for it they like
[47:52.440 --> 47:57.600]  it it's like notches in their gun belt you understand that okay I got a bunch
[47:57.600 --> 48:00.400]  of the news I said I'd go to your phone calls we're gonna go to call so late
[48:00.400 --> 48:04.960]  after the Tarpolis joining us right now let's go to Greg in California Greg
[48:04.960 --> 48:09.320]  you're on the air go ahead hey I tell you doing I just wanted to bring up a
[48:09.320 --> 48:15.840]  couple of little points that I thought Clinton and Obama right after right
[48:15.840 --> 48:20.080]  when everything got really excited it seemed that they had very well thought
[48:20.080 --> 48:24.800]  out calculated words that you know they're funding the revolution but in
[48:24.800 --> 48:30.400]  case it doesn't work they say oh well we want him to stand down while their
[48:30.400 --> 48:35.760]  armies that are funded are taking over but Jimmy Carter would make a difference
[48:35.760 --> 48:40.880]  and then I just thought it was interesting also that the TSA had the
[48:40.880 --> 48:46.480]  big announcements the day before and you know all the attention got off of that
[48:46.480 --> 48:51.120]  that's right they said listen we don't care if the law says you can have
[48:51.120 --> 48:55.760]  private screeners here we're not gonna allow that now we run things we're
[48:55.760 --> 49:01.280]  seizing your infrastructure it's all beta testing for what we're in store for
[49:01.280 --> 49:05.840]  it's planning the seed expect so we can expect to have our internet shut down
[49:05.840 --> 49:11.720]  and you know just on top of everything I just want to comment on you know I'm
[49:11.720 --> 49:16.160]  from Berkeley Oakland San Francisco it's really diverse here I have never
[49:16.160 --> 49:21.480]  met a rude Middle Eastern person in my life you know with all this money that
[49:21.480 --> 49:26.160]  we're you know putting towards this it's just ridiculous now they're trying to
[49:26.160 --> 49:31.120]  radicalize the Muslim world this is where so many sciences the alphabet
[49:31.120 --> 49:36.320]  astronomy were developed chemistry and they're very intelligent people and
[49:36.320 --> 49:40.440]  they wanted to have liberty and freedom and our criminal government run by the
[49:40.440 --> 49:45.400]  banks is on record putting radical Muslims in everywhere and then taking our
[49:45.400 --> 49:51.000]  liberties in the name of fighting the radical Muslims right they're very
[49:51.000 --> 49:56.720]  gracious people you know and it's you know everything's everything no no
[49:56.720 --> 50:02.000]  crisis goes to waste it's what we can expect from our government absolutely

[54:00.640 --> 54:20.520]  The Syros Jones from 1810 to 1913 made his great-grand children believe you
[54:20.520 --> 54:25.160]  could live to a hundred and twelve. Globalist puppet Muhammad El-Baraday is
[54:25.160 --> 54:33.840]  demanding the old worn out globalist vampire stepped down so that he can
[54:33.840 --> 54:40.600]  begin supping with pleasure at the throat of the Egyptian people and like a
[54:40.600 --> 54:47.720]  swarm of carrion crows of course the bankers are expanding their force
[54:47.720 --> 54:51.920]  collapse of this country but before they can do that they've got to have all the
[54:51.920 --> 54:55.120]  telescreens up telling you to watch your neighbors they've got to have the
[54:55.120 --> 54:58.520]  police trained at the internal checkpoints which they're now expanding
[54:58.520 --> 55:02.920]  they've got to have their internet kill switch in place they'll probably
[55:02.920 --> 55:07.080]  partially shut the web down during a fake cyber attack then turn it right
[55:07.080 --> 55:12.000]  back on to say see we're doing this to protect you just to set that precedent
[55:12.000 --> 55:16.840]  Google announced obviously a week ago that they are gonna start filtering out
[55:16.840 --> 55:22.280]  alternative media and blocking it it's all happening right on time for the
[55:22.280 --> 55:28.720]  dollar devaluation and the confiscation of the pension funds and when you
[55:28.720 --> 55:32.840]  rebel don't worry they'll have a new solution for you even more tyranny
[55:32.840 --> 55:38.000]  only being aware of the complexities of this do we have any chance of stopping
[55:38.000 --> 55:46.560]  them but going back to I guess it was Jay in Michigan who was bringing up IT
[55:46.560 --> 55:52.400]  situations go ahead so to the point that I was making and then I've got a quick
[55:52.400 --> 55:56.040]  question for you which actually wasn't an IT situation I'm in the medical
[55:56.040 --> 56:00.440]  manufacturing business formerly owned an automatic automotive manufacturing
[56:00.440 --> 56:04.080]  business in Michigan and one of the things that we're seeing happening right
[56:04.080 --> 56:08.240]  now that's ties into the whole globalization and corporatization of
[56:08.240 --> 56:14.120]  the world is in automotive all these small shops that were very productive had
[56:14.120 --> 56:18.680]  an owner-employee relationships treated their employees well it would get bought
[56:18.680 --> 56:22.920]  up by these big corporate holding companies now I'm beginning to see the
[56:22.920 --> 56:26.640]  same thing happen in the medical sector too well that's what I was saying
[56:26.640 --> 56:30.360]  dealing with that's what I was saying dealing with IT because these big
[56:30.360 --> 56:36.080]  mega holding companies have unlimited fiat banker bailout money paid for by
[56:36.080 --> 56:40.560]  our tax dollars it's not free market it's basically like playing monopoly
[56:40.560 --> 56:45.800]  against the bank you can't win well absolutely and what happens I mean this
[56:45.800 --> 56:50.080]  is happening across interstries worldwide but what the killer is is that
[56:50.080 --> 56:54.600]  it's part of the tactic of destroying the middle class I mean I got so worked
[56:54.600 --> 56:58.360]  up about this a few years ago I actually took a run for state rep here in
[56:58.360 --> 57:03.120]  Michigan as an independent libertarian and you know we're trying to find ways
[57:03.120 --> 57:08.640]  to deal with this and I'm feeling like it's snow-balling faster than can be
[57:08.640 --> 57:14.200]  handled through the conventional channels of government like running for
[57:14.200 --> 57:17.840]  office getting in position and they can change it I just feel like the whole
[57:17.840 --> 57:22.080]  thing's running away you know we're still trying to do it and I've been doing a
[57:22.080 --> 57:26.000]  lot of homework trying to study you know y'all is when you talk about globalists
[57:26.000 --> 57:31.440]  you talk about population growth you know how is population growth affecting
[57:31.440 --> 57:37.760]  the snowball of this globalist attitude and trying to bring whole
[57:37.760 --> 57:43.160]  populace is under control you know near militant control and trying to come up
[57:43.160 --> 57:47.200]  with a timeline you know and how to react to this well let's be clear and I
[57:47.200 --> 57:51.720]  appreciate your call but but they're not trying to bring things under control
[57:51.720 --> 57:58.200]  they're trying to wipe out any country or organization or group of people that
[57:58.200 --> 58:03.120]  are self-sufficient they don't want things to be nice they don't want it
[58:03.120 --> 58:10.080]  under control they want things in a disheveled collapsing situation so that
[58:10.080 --> 58:15.200]  they can expand their their overall police state in the name of cleaning up
[58:15.200 --> 58:19.840]  the crisis but then they never even fix the crisis because they go into the
[58:19.840 --> 58:24.960]  next phase of an even bigger crisis and then even more control to supposedly
[58:24.960 --> 58:29.560]  fix it and then another even bigger crisis and more control more control
[58:29.560 --> 58:34.440]  that's the method to their madness it's order out of chaos we'll be back with
[58:34.440 --> 58:38.440]  more phone calls in 70 seconds in the second hour that Webster Tarpley joining

[01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:39.280]  we're going back to your phone calls right now and obviously we're talking
[01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:42.560]  about what's happening in Egypt the open announcement that the government is
[01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:46.800]  trying to put in an internet kill switch so they can shut down a freedom of
[01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:51.920]  speech during a police state takeover it's all accelerating and the globalist
[01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:57.840]  knew when they ordered Egypt to cut the food allotments to their population
[01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:03.920]  close to half of which are living at starvation level without that food that
[01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:09.120]  it would cause this rebellion and then the globalist give Egypt the savior the
[01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:15.360]  well-known globalist UN minion Mohammed L. Baraday let's talk to Randy in North
[01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:24.400]  Carolina then Lane Patriot Brian Mike and others go ahead Rudy welcome Rudy
[01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:29.480]  you're on the air yes yes would you like to over the holidays I'll talk to my
[01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:33.560]  family over the holidays and I was trying to explain to my in-laws how New
[01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:36.760]  York is now a police state and they didn't understand so as I was talking to
[01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:43.520]  my came with idea of why don't people just start right now many times they ask
[01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:47.800]  for the ID every way time you turn around somebody's asking for your ID
[01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:52.640]  somebody's asking for you know get more information the more information well
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:56.080]  that's so if you're on a pickup list they can go ahead and scoop you up cops all
[01:01:56.080 --> 01:02:00.160]  over the world now have license plate readers and they drive by stolen cars
[01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:04.080]  they drive by and don't do anything about it it's all about politically
[01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:08.720]  tracking you and now they have TV shows about the police in New York where they
[01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:12.960]  show checkpoints on the roads checkpoints in the malls checkpoints in the
[01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:17.400]  subway with families and little kids having their school bags searched we're
[01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:25.080]  all learning how to be prisoners and America one big giant prison and and all
[01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:29.520]  of us basically as slaves and people think that's freedom land of the free home
[01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:33.840]  of the brave is where they put drugs in your water train your kids to spy on you
[01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:38.000]  and have checkpoints with guys with machine guns everywhere that's freedom
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:42.240]  having our internet shut off that's freedom having helicopters look through
[01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:46.640]  our walls that's freedom having our pension funds taken having the veterans
[01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:52.480]  death benefits taken that's freedom now tyranny is private property and happy
[01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:59.680]  families and health and freedom of mobility and privacy you see so so we
[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:06.520]  we're entering the 1984 system last thing Alex is you know what people don't
[01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:09.320]  realize what's happened over in Egypt right now notice how they saying that
[01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:14.200]  people have to defend themselves with shovels and knives see what happened is
[01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:17.520]  over here in America we have the opportunity right now to bear our arms
[01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:21.640]  when things go crazy I think that's the thing that's scaring this government in
[01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:26.080]  the arm and their leaders to their bones right now with that you know as much as
[01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:30.160]  they want to say the criminals got the guns and everything even if they do they
[01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:33.360]  know that they'll fight back they know that the people who are legally on the
[01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:36.400]  guns fighting back and if you ever notice which is something that I've been
[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:41.160]  watching lately the propaganda being perceived right now is that everybody's
[01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:44.720]  doing something stupid with a gun there's not they're never showing anything on
[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:48.720]  TV the blog the internet where people are legally defending themselves and are
[01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:52.360]  glad that they have their firearm it's always somebody doing something stupid
[01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:57.480]  and I think people need to start looking for positive sites of people defending
[01:03:57.480 --> 01:04:02.560]  that's right the media only hypes bad things that happen with guns but look
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:06.640]  at the statistics the vast majority of Americans are now pro-second amendment
[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:10.720]  they get it and the globalist are in trouble I appreciate your call Rudy
[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:16.040]  great points the New World Order is scared because the ghost of our founders
[01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:21.840]  who weren't perfect but but delivered to us that in a able right they simply
[01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:27.560]  uncovered it and pointed it out that slaves are disarmed free men and women
[01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:32.280]  are armed and so the ghost of our forefathers and mothers the spirit of
[01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:37.800]  1776 is still alive and well with us today and it literally animates our
[01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:42.480]  great contest for liberty now and this is the great contest against tyranny and
[01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:49.080]  that's the big ace in the hole that's the big wild card that's our due sex is
[01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:54.280]  that we have that second amendment and I'm gonna speak to that as we go to
[01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:57.880]  Tarpley coming up that was my next point I'm glad you raised it look at
[01:04:57.880 --> 01:05:03.720]  everybody else as well Alex told you the government announced recently that
[01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:08.440]  the recession is over it ended on June of 2009 the millions of Americans
[01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:12.400]  unable to find work might not agree perhaps a recession ended for the
[01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:15.800]  bankers and government employees but for the rest of us things seem to be
[01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:19.520]  getting worse gold and silver haven't heard the news either they've begun
[01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:23.080]  their long expected journey to the moon in addition to converting your
[01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:26.800]  shrinking dollars into gold and silver you should consider a food savings

[01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:35.120]  greatest dependency and we know it will be more precious than any financial

[01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:08.200]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:12.400]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:16.400]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:20.280]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:24.520]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:28.720]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:33.000]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:36.720]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:40.920]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:43.920]  mind folks I really believe in the solar powered generators offered by

[01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:09.760]  radio network
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:24.880]  all right we're talking about Egypt we're gonna open the phones up at the
[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:29.800]  bottom of the hour for your questions or comics to myself or Webster we've got
[01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:35.800]  some major US news on health care reform with a lot of states and courts
[01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:40.880]  battling it that is all coming up but Webster Griffin Tarbley who's a great
[01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:46.440]  analyst who joins us routinely is a doctor of history he's also an economist
[01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:52.040]  and a author but before I went to Webster there's one thing we can see
[01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:58.160]  illustrated by Egypt more than anything else on the ground and that's that
[01:08:58.160 --> 01:09:02.880]  governments can't and won't protect you and then a lot of Egyptians had illegal
[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:06.760]  firearms because there is a total gunband there for the citizens to defend
[01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:12.400]  their property and as in the case of New Orleans in 2005 and every other big
[01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:16.880]  event worldwide the police and military have been caught have been shot have been
[01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:22.400]  beaten have been arrested by the citizens robbing jewelry stores homes
[01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:27.720]  anytime there's a crisis government is gonna come and try to rob you because
[01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:32.760]  government basically in the modern age has been set up to rob us and so the the
[01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:37.920]  type of agents they recruit are going to do this during a period of anarchy now
[01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:42.080]  last week I reserve judgment on Wednesday Thursday Friday I said the
[01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:49.520]  people are hungry there is a real anger in the Middle East but also in North
[01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:57.120]  Africa not just in Egypt but Saudi Arabia Tunisia and Yemen Jordan the
[01:09:57.120 --> 01:10:01.560]  people see the corruption but the globalists know that this is coming to
[01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:09.320]  ahead and so they may want to trigger this now to try to put in their own
[01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:16.440]  people instead of groups that actually represent the democratic wishes of the
[01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:21.360]  people in these regions but I said I've got to hold back this may be organic but
[01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:25.840]  then over the weekend the State Department admitted many others admitted
[01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:30.240]  that yes the West was funding the former head of the atomic energy agency
[01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:35.800]  Muhammad el-Baraday that the Muslim Brotherhood is trying to overthrow the
[01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:43.040]  other globalist allies Saudi Arabia of course places like Jordan Yemen and
[01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:47.200]  Webster partly my first question for you and then I want to give you the floor on
[01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:50.440]  these issues they give us the full spectrum analysis and you've been
[01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:53.800]  proven right again because they now admit they've been financing this whole
[01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:59.680]  thing while giving tacit support to their old tired dictator who wasn't
[01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:04.160]  following their every order on Malthusian forced abortion and things like
[01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:09.080]  that but but is it not the IMF and World Bank in the last 14 months ordering
[01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:13.080]  Egypt and other Middle Eastern countries and North African countries to cut the
[01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:18.600]  food allotment under austerity with 50% or more of the population on $2 a day
[01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:25.880]  getting this emergency food allotment the globalists put in the ingredients and
[01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:31.200]  created a political atmosphere that they knew would be a powder keg then they
[01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:38.720]  send in their color revolution Soros trained endorsed by Brzezinski yesterday
[01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:43.640]  on ABC News with Christina Amanpour another globalist hack right at the key
[01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:47.840]  point where they create the ingredients in the atmosphere they then throw the
[01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:52.720]  match into the powder keg and it appears they're beginning to fail so Webster
[01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:57.720]  what is the great game why are they doing this well it is a CIA color
[01:11:57.720 --> 01:12:02.720]  revolution with plenty of backup from MI6 and it's it's a people power coup
[01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:07.560]  attempted but I think now failing and ebbing now the economic background that
[01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:12.200]  you correctly point to is that there is large unemployment in Egypt there's a
[01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:16.600]  rising price of fuel but this is determined by speculators in London the
[01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:21.920]  international commodity exchange ICE and of course there's there's a rising
[01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:26.400]  price of wheat but that's also speculators that the New York comics in
[01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:30.880]  other words the depression is not caused by Mubarak or any of these other people
[01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:35.840]  the depression comes to you direct from Wall Street the attempt obviously of the
[01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:41.400]  Wall Street City of London finance oligarchs is to deflect anger about
[01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:45.680]  these situations towards local governments which are always easier for
[01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:49.360]  people to fight because of you know they're limited understanding of how
[01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:55.280]  this stuff works now Mubarak also of course has this repressive side to him
[01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:59.800]  he's been in power for 30 years he's been ruling under a state of emergency the
[01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:03.720]  state of emergency however began when Anglo-American intelligence has
[01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:07.760]  fascinated Sadat with the help of this Muslim brotherhood remember
[01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:14.280]  Eman Zawahiri the number two to Bin Laden in his previous existence was it
[01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:18.920]  was an Egypt activist right just from Egypt that he was part of the the attempt
[01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:24.920]  to kill actually did kill Sadat and then he was able to flee to London and was
[01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:30.320]  able to continue his career so this is the basic thing is it's a destabilization
[01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:35.960]  there are real issues around it but destabilization one of the interviews I'm
[01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:41.160]  fortunate here I can get the Al Jazeera push vision in in English right and
[01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:45.600]  they have been hyping mercilessly hyping the overthrow of Mubarak and on this
[01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:51.440]  British intelligence line so they had a guy on there who said I'm gonna go out
[01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:56.240]  and demonstrate I don't care about Mubarak one way or another I want higher
[01:13:56.240 --> 01:14:01.520]  wages but the minimum wage in Egypt is way too low it needs to be immediately
[01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:07.000]  hiked up and he says I want a better deal on on the on the on the food right
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:11.280]  and the bread price now that I think shows you what a lot of this is and
[01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:14.360]  there was people are willing to to the extent that anybody has turned out at
[01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:18.760]  all and these these crowds are very anemic they the people who were doing
[01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:21.320]  it some of them are there simply because they hope to get a little bit better
[01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:26.640]  deal they're not there for hope change singing tomorrows and El Baraday I think
[01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:33.160]  very very few people care about this the main thing I would say that people
[01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:36.560]  have to understand is despite the hype in the US television this thing is
[01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:42.200]  ebbing away it's failing the goal of the US and the British was obviously to
[01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:47.520]  force a panic on Friday right Friday being Friday prayers right the holiday
[01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:51.720]  in in Egypt and much of the Muslim world of course it's the equivalent of
[01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:56.720]  Sunday in in the in European or North American countries so they were trying
[01:14:56.720 --> 01:15:03.800]  to get to stampede the collapse of the regime on Friday and they have failed
[01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:09.280]  and if you look at the number of people they're able to turn out this is
[01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:15.960]  nothing it's not on the scale of Kiev in 2004 they're way weaker than Kiev and
[01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:19.880]  they have other problems but just in terms of the numbers I think you can see
[01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:26.960]  it it starts with 15,000 on the 25th of January according to to various things
[01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:31.440]  that I found on the internet on the on Friday that was the day of rage that was
[01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:37.640]  when you had you know tens of thousands they claimed by the by the Saturday the
[01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:43.880]  29th they had I think 50,000 in this central square of Cairo this career and
[01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:49.320]  that seems to have been their high point by the 30th it's down to 5,000 at
[01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:57.640]  career on January 31st today the the even Al Jazeera admitted that at six o'clock
[01:15:57.640 --> 01:16:02.000]  this morning there were 200 people in career career square now that's
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:08.320]  that's pathetic in Kiev in 2004 they had 10 20,000 young nihilists who are
[01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:11.600]  willing to stay out overnight in tents right with plenty of drugs and plenty of
[01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:14.840]  money well Webster Webster I get the point that you that you're saying you
[01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:19.240]  believe it's failing and Al Jazeera did hype that Mubarak had fled the country
[01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:23.480]  last Thursday Friday Saturday even after he was on television clearly there
[01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:28.840]  they ran with the diff the disinformation that that he had fled but
[01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:33.440]  but on a larger issue why do the globalist and who are the main players
[01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:40.520]  here why do the globalists want to do this to Egypt that has been extremely
[01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:44.680]  compliant with them let me just add one one last thing just for the irony of it
[01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:50.240]  right today Al Jazeera claims 250,000 in this career square and the Egyptian
[01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:53.920]  state television then switched to a continuous speed of career square
[01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:58.720]  showing you know 10,000 if they're very very lucky maybe more like 5,000 now
[01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:05.840]  the Y of it the Y is that you have these entrenched dictators in the Arab
[01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:10.760]  world right you have Bouteflika in Algeria you and some of them are more
[01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:16.680]  harsh less harsh you have Gaddafi in Libya you have Mubarak in Egypt but you
[01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:21.160]  also got the Jordanian monarchy you've got the Saudi Arabian royal family and
[01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:25.760]  of course there's the Assad dynasty in Syria these are all entrenched right
[01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:29.360]  Gaddafi has been there for 40 years Mubarak's been there for 30 years the
[01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:34.120]  Assad dynasty for 30 years the Saudis have been there basically ever since the
[01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:41.720]  1920s so they're entrenched they don't follow orders to the degree that a new
[01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:47.960]  unstable parliamentary regime would have to do it the US is in a desperate
[01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:53.360]  situation they need kamikaze puppets if you go to Mubarak and say we want you
[01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:58.160]  to become a kamikaze puppet he'll simply say no I won't do it so what they need
[01:17:58.160 --> 01:18:03.240]  is El Baradeh this he's an agent of the International Crisis Group that I was
[01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:08.240]  already denouncing on my website earlier in the week and also on my
[01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:11.520]  Twitter feed that people should tune into Webster G. Tarpley if you want to keep
[01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:16.000]  up for a minute a minute they want countries of bubble they can
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:19.600]  use internationally what do they want to do the whole idea of the US in the
[01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:25.960]  Middle East is to create an Arab Sunni front against Iran its allies and the
[01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:29.720]  Shiite populations in general it's the obvious where they do it right they use
[01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:35.720]  war religion clash of civilizations Arab Sunnis against Persian Iranian Shiites
[01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:39.920]  and others right including Hezbollah and and other you know Hamas and other
[01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:45.200]  people that that tend to go with with Iran you gotta have Egypt for that
[01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:49.200]  right Egypt is 80 million people this is the big population center of the
[01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:52.880]  entire Arab world you've got to have them in some kind of a militant mode and
[01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:57.840]  with Mubarak no Mubarak wants stability he wants Mubarak he wants the Mubarak
[01:18:57.840 --> 01:19:03.080]  dynasty he wants his friend Gamal to be his successor he doesn't want radical
[01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:07.120]  change and similarly right Gaddafi is not interested in in leading some
[01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:11.520]  crusade against Iran so you got to get these people out and therefore the
[01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:15.840]  kamikaze puppet against Iran you also want people you can use against China
[01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:20.120]  and people you can use against Russia these are the main goals and I talked
[01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:24.160]  about this at the beginning right that that Carter Carter had tried this 30
[01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:29.080]  years ago and Obama is the new Carter and Obama has tried it in Iran he's
[01:19:29.080 --> 01:19:35.960]  failed the Lebanon attempt of the 2005 is failed the US is not able to dictate
[01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:39.080]  the government of Iraq and they're also not able to influence the government
[01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:43.520]  of Webster stay there when we come back I want to pull back from all of this and
[01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:47.680]  look at the larger geopolitical ramifications how it all fits together
[01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:53.000]  and what this signifies that the Anglo-American establishment can't take
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:57.280]  over Lebanon can't pull the scam with Russia in Georgia can't hold on to
[01:19:57.280 --> 01:20:01.800]  Eastern Europe these people power revolutions are failing a very wealthy

[01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:19.640]  it really is staggering for me intellectually to actually see mainstream
[01:24:19.640 --> 01:24:24.840]  US news promoting an internet kill switch like gee look Haasie Mubarak's got
[01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:30.320]  one we sure need one we've got a report from Paul Joseph Watson that just went
[01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:35.000]  up on info wars.com and prison planet.com that is the most detailed yet
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:39.720]  breaking down this clear and present danger and the headline is kill switch
[01:24:39.720 --> 01:24:47.080]  Obama administration fears Egypt style revolt in the US and Watson's got the
[01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:51.200]  proof of this in his article obviously I want to make this the number one search
[01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:57.160]  term Obama kill switch let's make Obama kill switch the number one search term
[01:24:57.160 --> 01:25:00.800]  today let's do it again folks so people understand the threat against the
[01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:05.880]  internet Obama kill switch the headline is kill switch Obama administration
[01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:14.320]  fears Egypt style revolt in the US we've got to get attention on the Obama kill
[01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:19.320]  switch now a lot of conservatives are upset by this remember a Republican
[01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:23.760]  front man's gonna have this as well soon and they're putting the cybersecurity
[01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:27.960]  grid in place Webster I wanted to get into that with you but we'll cover that
[01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:33.760]  in a moment finishing up with why they've done this it is a bold move it
[01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:37.840]  does smack of desperation where does Israel stand because they've been
[01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:43.960]  praising Mubarak and Harats and others are saying Obama will go down as the
[01:25:43.960 --> 01:25:50.360]  president who lost Egypt is that more of just Israel on the surface attempting to
[01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:54.320]  praise Mubarak knowing that that'll backfire and then cause rebellion
[01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:59.200]  against him or where does Israel stand in all this the public posture of the
[01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:03.760]  Israelis is that they support Mubarak Netanyahu made a statement saying we
[01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:09.160]  we urge everybody to be nice to Mubarak and leave him in power and it's
[01:26:09.160 --> 01:26:13.400]  obvious at that level what they're responding to right if you have chaos in
[01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:17.580]  Egypt suppose the government the whole regime which was founded by NASA in
[01:26:17.580 --> 01:26:22.920]  1952 that goes down and you have chaos right you've had a taste of it then who
[01:26:22.920 --> 01:26:26.720]  is there there's the army and then there's the Muslim Brotherhood I would
[01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:31.760]  stress the Muslim Brotherhood is a British intelligence creation from 1926
[01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:36.160]  that's admitted and by the way the Muslim Brotherhood is in the Associated Press
[01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:40.320]  saying we're gonna bring down Saudi Arabia we're gonna bring down Jordan and
[01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:44.200]  that was my next issue here but finish up their Webster it's just this is such a
[01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:48.440]  powder keg why what do you think the Saudi Arabians and others are doing
[01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:53.280]  realizing that the that the globalist are trying to bring them down well just
[01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:55.920]  step by step I think the Muslim Brotherhood again is this British
[01:26:55.920 --> 01:26:59.680]  intelligence creation in the in the years of NASA now NASA had many many
[01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:03.640]  positive features NASA was building infrastructure on a tremendous scale
[01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:07.640]  that that's one high damn is an example of the infrastructure that build the
[01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:11.280]  nation otherwise they would be having floods now they've got flood control
[01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:15.600]  they've got hydroelectric they've got a whole series of advantages like the
[01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:20.000]  Nile of course being the center the center of the country in terms of the
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:25.200]  the awareness now there's a very interesting statement from Hugo Chavez
[01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:29.800]  of Venezuela and he says I've been on the telephone with Colonel Gaddafi of
[01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:36.480]  Libya and with President Assad of Syria and they briefed me on the US meddling
[01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:42.720]  in Egypt and he says I find this sickening I find it shameful that they
[01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:48.920]  betray their ally and then he had that's how the devil pays you so now all the
[01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:53.480]  US client states in the Middle East have to wonder and what could is an alliance
[01:27:53.480 --> 01:27:59.080]  with the US it's not worth anything and that's gonna I think increase the
[01:27:59.080 --> 01:28:03.840]  ability of the Saudi Arabia we know that there was an attempt by by Bandar
[01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:08.680]  right Prince Bandar wanted to open to Russia in a significant way and then
[01:28:08.680 --> 01:28:13.560]  that seemed to have been shut down I would look for people in Algeria people
[01:28:13.560 --> 01:28:18.440]  in Saudi Arabia you know to get on the phone and indeed Mubarak right if I
[01:28:18.440 --> 01:28:22.440]  were Mubarak I'd be on the phone with Putin I'd be on the phone with who in
[01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:27.040]  China I'd be on the phone so this is a desperate gamut but so I go back to that
[01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:31.360]  as you started to allude to what is Jordan thinking what is Saudi Arabia
[01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:37.560]  thinking when the globalist run Muslim brotherhood on record who our media uses
[01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:41.680]  to take our liberties away in the name of the threat it's a multi-face coin or
[01:28:41.680 --> 01:28:46.720]  a or a Swiss army knife they use for every you know every crisis this this
[01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:52.320]  proto al-Qaeda they've got proto al-Qaeda threatening all these globalist slash
[01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:57.040]  Israeli allies I mean that's got to be a wake-up call to them especially if this
[01:28:57.040 --> 01:29:02.720]  fails in Egypt yes and for Egypt especially that the big vulnerability of
[01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:08.240]  Egypt is wheat they are dependent on imported food in particular the question
[01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:13.440]  of bread now they have a system which is very good which is a system of subsidies
[01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:19.080]  for the bread price they keep bread cheap as a means of maintaining social
[01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:23.760]  and governmental stability obviously now Wall Street has been beating up the
[01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:28.280]  world price of wheat there's been a huge upward spike in the in the bread price
[01:29:28.280 --> 01:29:31.020]  and then stay there stay there and then they're following the Twitter and the
[01:29:31.020 --> 01:29:34.640]  social networks they know the Egyptians are ripe to rebel because they've got
[01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:41.200]  empty bellies incomes Elberide from the UN I will save you all I mean how
[01:29:41.200 --> 01:29:44.320]  obvious is this we'll be right back Webster terribly I just can't believe
[01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:55.600]  how treacherous this is though we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex

[01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:50.600]  slash America okay continuing here Webster you know I'm really having
[01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:55.560]  trouble dealing with this because if you go back to last Monday Tuesday Wednesday
[01:35:55.560 --> 01:35:59.920]  Thursday I knew that WikiLeaks was connected to Tunisia I knew that was a
[01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:05.840]  staged event it was admitted by the West it was but then I looked at Mubarak
[01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:10.440]  this servant who did everything he was told the torture centers the black
[01:36:10.440 --> 01:36:17.960]  sites Westerners being flown in to be tortured there Israel worshiping him
[01:36:17.960 --> 01:36:24.320]  Netanyahu saying what buddies they are the people they're revolting against
[01:36:24.320 --> 01:36:29.720]  him seeing him you know as a US slash Israel puppet and then to do this to him
[01:36:29.720 --> 01:36:35.440]  if they were unsuccessful it just shows that there's no honor among these people
[01:36:35.440 --> 01:36:40.000]  even even amongst their own thieves and and and dictators but then they came
[01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:48.120]  out and bragged that L. Baraday was their man from the UN and that they had
[01:36:48.120 --> 01:36:53.480]  engineered this and they were actually proud of it I mean it just it does
[01:36:53.480 --> 01:36:59.880]  smack of desperate actions and that is really scary to know that they're really
[01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:04.640]  trying to overthrow and destabilize Saudi Arabia I mean what does Jordan think of
[01:37:04.640 --> 01:37:09.040]  this to now have the Muslim Brotherhood openly run by the West charging
[01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:13.480]  around threatening people I mean are they trying to set off World War three
[01:37:13.480 --> 01:37:18.040]  here Webster well I think it's a phase change of world history if if the
[01:37:18.040 --> 01:37:22.040]  destabilization of Egypt had succeeded and I don't think it will at this point
[01:37:22.040 --> 01:37:26.440]  this would have been the triumph of the Empire the crushing of the nation state
[01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:32.960]  everywhere starting with the Arab world you know a huge world hysteria the
[01:37:32.960 --> 01:37:37.320]  destruction of many many nations and the emergence of an overarching world
[01:37:37.320 --> 01:37:40.080]  empire in the form of the international because they would trigger these
[01:37:40.080 --> 01:37:44.120]  rebellions everywhere and then roll in with their revolutionaries and and
[01:37:44.120 --> 01:37:49.840]  globalist flags would be hauled up in even more nations right and and that's
[01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:52.840]  that's the issue now this I don't think this will happen now at least not in
[01:37:52.840 --> 01:37:57.320]  that form the it's a huge defeat for the US because they came out and as
[01:37:57.320 --> 01:38:02.480]  Chavez and Gaddafi and Assad have all noted they essentially were out there
[01:38:02.480 --> 01:38:06.280]  shooting the works for destabilization of Egypt right it's a
[01:38:06.280 --> 01:38:11.040]  a babong quite a double or nothing play right that's that's the hail Mary ranch
[01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:15.480]  on on destabilization hail Mary yeah there you go and that I don't think it's
[01:38:15.480 --> 01:38:20.000]  working it's it's running out of steam they have no color they have no slogan
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:24.040]  they have no leader they have no TV they have no internet the police in the army
[01:38:24.040 --> 01:38:27.520]  remain loyal they don't have working people with them because these people are
[01:38:27.520 --> 01:38:31.920]  not not credible right but now the Barak has said this is a foreign
[01:38:31.920 --> 01:38:36.680]  conspiracy yes right and it dealt about a day Jetson from his apartment in
[01:38:36.680 --> 01:38:41.200]  Vienna where he spends his time with his money from from the Soros Brzezinski
[01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:45.120]  international crisis group right who were part of this the part of the action
[01:38:45.120 --> 01:38:51.480]  in Tunisia and this this is simply not credible now Moody's today has downgraded
[01:38:51.480 --> 01:38:55.800]  Egypt now here's this is the Wall Street attack if you look at the internal
[01:38:55.800 --> 01:38:59.080]  arrangements in Egypt what does Wall Street care about in a place like Egypt
[01:38:59.080 --> 01:39:03.400]  obviously they want to attack the bread subsidy because this will lead to
[01:39:03.400 --> 01:39:08.800]  tremendous instability when the US says they want to you know revise or review
[01:39:08.800 --> 01:39:14.320]  the aid posture right the 1.5 billion or 3 billion depending on how you count it
[01:39:14.320 --> 01:39:19.400]  that Egypt gets every year at the heart of this is money to buy food on the
[01:39:19.400 --> 01:39:23.600]  world market by the way none of this is your opinion in the IMF World Bank XM
[01:39:23.600 --> 01:39:27.960]  bank documents we've gotten off and on the last 30 years the biggest data dump
[01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:33.120]  2002 they admit they go in to third-world countries and say we'll give you loans
[01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:37.000]  but get rid of subsidies and behind the scenes are rubbing their hands together
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:42.000]  going get our takeover revolution ready we'll really loot them now I mean they
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:48.160]  know what they're doing they're trying to set the atmosphere they're trying to
[01:39:48.160 --> 01:39:53.320]  set the table for this clearly trying to destabilize the Middle East a lot of
[01:39:53.320 --> 01:39:56.880]  people in this demonstration are the rich and leaders of Cairo North and in
[01:39:56.880 --> 01:40:01.040]  other words the comfortable middle class and up people who have the internet and
[01:40:01.040 --> 01:40:05.280]  who care about Twitter and the rest of this stuff when they say economic
[01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:10.840]  reform that generally means destroy the subsidies free market right free market
[01:40:10.840 --> 01:40:16.920]  free trade globalization read the brain of international finance capital and all
[01:40:16.920 --> 01:40:21.440]  the rest of it the response from the barack told us and then let me just say
[01:40:21.440 --> 01:40:26.080]  that the Moody's Moody says the reason they're downgrading Egypt that is that
[01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:30.880]  they're afraid that Mubarak will increase social expenditure have a higher
[01:40:30.880 --> 01:40:35.240]  minimum wage increase the the food subsidies this sort of thing and they
[01:40:35.240 --> 01:40:39.040]  don't want this therefore they they want to have a speculative run on the
[01:40:39.040 --> 01:40:42.760]  Egyptian pound and on Egyptian government debt so he's gonna have to
[01:40:42.760 --> 01:40:46.680]  respond with with protectionist measures of his own the obvious thing from
[01:40:46.680 --> 01:40:51.480]  Mubarak to do is raise the minimum wage get the price of bread and cooking oil
[01:40:51.480 --> 01:40:56.560]  and fuel down kick out the International Monetary Fund declare a debt moratorium
[01:40:56.560 --> 01:41:00.600]  and then what are the resources of Egypt what you got the Nile okay the
[01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:04.640]  Aswan High Dam is there give the Nile the full Tennessee Valley Authority
[01:41:04.640 --> 01:41:09.560]  treatment what else do you have the Suez Canal Suez Canal still has 8% of
[01:41:09.560 --> 01:41:14.840]  World Trade why not widen it why not make that 10% 15% collect some tolls and
[01:41:14.840 --> 01:41:18.200]  get the people working because the other the other big thing of course is
[01:41:18.200 --> 01:41:22.840]  unemployment well we have you know pretty good we have about 22 23%
[01:41:22.840 --> 01:41:27.760]  unemployment here in reality Spain has 20% we just saw the Spanish Foreign
[01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:31.680]  Minister at the European Union meeting they go we stand with the people in the
[01:41:31.680 --> 01:41:36.680]  streets yeah as long as it's before we get into the wider field Webster I want
[01:41:36.680 --> 01:41:42.680]  to go back to this area is this not a fleeing forward the globalists knew that
[01:41:42.680 --> 01:41:47.040]  there might have been an actual democratic move against Mubarak their
[01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:52.800]  old puppet so they went ahead and triggered this now I don't I don't see
[01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:56.840]  any any organized opposition they say that the one group that stands out as
[01:41:56.840 --> 01:42:00.280]  it's April 6th and these this is basically a group of NATO agents right
[01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:06.000]  with them they've taken over the same paraphernalia as well as as the CIA was
[01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:12.480]  using in in Belgrade in Serbia 10 years ago 11 years ago now so I don't see any
[01:42:12.480 --> 01:42:17.160]  real movement there is no organized force in a country like this that the
[01:42:17.160 --> 01:42:21.720]  policy alternative would almost have to emerge from inside the ruling party
[01:42:21.720 --> 01:42:27.840]  somebody interested in in actual economic reform which would not mean IMF
[01:42:27.840 --> 01:42:32.120]  World Bank okay Wall Street Webster I want to go to some phone calls here on
[01:42:32.120 --> 01:42:36.440]  this subject because I promised you but before we do that briefly give us your
[01:42:36.440 --> 01:42:42.080]  synopsis of what you believe is going to play out what the general ramifications
[01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:46.520]  of this are going to be in the Middle East in North Africa into the rest of
[01:42:46.520 --> 01:42:51.760]  the Mediterranean and then other movements you see around the world with
[01:42:51.760 --> 01:42:59.360]  the Soros run gang calling for 100 trillion in additional banker bailouts
[01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:06.520]  to then leverage out to 59.9% credit card bills for the general public what do
[01:43:06.520 --> 01:43:11.880]  you see happening when Ireland has this election the move towards the EU falling
[01:43:11.880 --> 01:43:18.360]  apart I mean this is a desperate move and it you're just studying this I see a
[01:43:18.360 --> 01:43:23.040]  lot of evidence that the New World Order is actually in deep trouble well I
[01:43:23.040 --> 01:43:28.160]  would say just on Egypt specifically right today the demonstrators I call
[01:43:28.160 --> 01:43:31.280]  them the nihilists because I think that's what they are today the
[01:43:31.280 --> 01:43:35.960]  demonstrators have called for a general strike now they don't talk about this
[01:43:35.960 --> 01:43:40.520]  too much they the banks and other businesses are closed but that was
[01:43:40.520 --> 01:43:44.440]  already announced during the weekend and it's just part of the the sort of
[01:43:44.440 --> 01:43:49.160]  attempt to cool down Cairo so I don't know they've all they seem to be calling
[01:43:49.160 --> 01:43:53.200]  also for another general strike tomorrow and above all tomorrow they say
[01:43:53.200 --> 01:43:58.640]  they want to have a million man March well we will see and remember watch out
[01:43:58.640 --> 01:44:02.240]  for those camera angles right if they if they're gonna claim a million men March
[01:44:02.240 --> 01:44:06.440]  we want to see the whole thing we want to see an oceanic crowd I don't think
[01:44:06.440 --> 01:44:10.720]  you're gonna see it not and not in this form the other thing is that one of
[01:44:10.720 --> 01:44:14.720]  these groups has put out an ultimatum to the Egyptian army saying we want to see
[01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:19.720]  which side you're on well that's that sounds like something pretty pretty
[01:44:19.720 --> 01:44:24.320]  desperate now the awareness of the color revolution of the techniques of this
[01:44:24.320 --> 01:44:28.240]  thing I think has grown to the point where it's gonna be increasingly
[01:44:28.240 --> 01:44:34.600]  harder to have more color revolutions CIA people power coups postmodern pushes
[01:44:34.600 --> 01:44:41.680]  in these other countries Algeria big oil producer Syria very very critical place
[01:44:41.680 --> 01:44:47.080]  Russian naval base there Jordan always an important country so forth
[01:44:47.080 --> 01:44:52.800]  Libya also oil I think it's gonna be harder and harder for the Anglo-American
[01:44:52.800 --> 01:44:56.560]  intelligence to organize this kind of thing in those those countries now that
[01:44:56.560 --> 01:45:01.600]  would obviously mean then a growth of other influence Chinese Russian
[01:45:01.600 --> 01:45:06.840]  Brazilian and and perhaps also more independence on the part of countries
[01:45:06.840 --> 01:45:10.240]  like Turkey which have been chafing and we're already seeing that let me
[01:45:10.240 --> 01:45:16.880]  interject this again last week I know the Egyptians have reasons to be angry I
[01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:23.560]  don't like Mubarak but I even last week couldn't believe that the West that
[01:45:23.560 --> 01:45:28.440]  these banking interests are this ruthless and and and and and this back
[01:45:28.440 --> 01:45:33.560]  stabbing to one of their own henchmen but now partly you're proven right again
[01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:37.920]  it's completely admitted that they're doing this and and clearly they didn't
[01:45:37.920 --> 01:45:42.000]  just go after Egypt because it's one of the most populist in the region but
[01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:46.840]  because it was one of the only countries that they've got their minions in so
[01:45:46.840 --> 01:45:51.600]  that they could try to trigger a domino to fall could it be it was the only
[01:45:51.600 --> 01:45:55.960]  domino that they really thought that they could push over and if it does fall
[01:45:55.960 --> 01:46:02.440]  over will that signify the fall of Saudi Arabia the fall of Jordan I mean I mean
[01:46:02.440 --> 01:46:08.560]  those countries have got to be reassessing their their deals they've
[01:46:08.560 --> 01:46:13.320]  made with the central bankers yes in the meantime look at what happened in
[01:46:13.320 --> 01:46:18.600]  Sudan the Anglo-Americans have been trying to bust up Sudan for decades and
[01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:21.840]  and they claim now that they've succeeded with this referendum that the
[01:46:21.840 --> 01:46:25.960]  southern Sudan will succeed from the north I don't know what the reality is
[01:46:25.960 --> 01:46:29.480]  on the ground but these are the reports that the referendum in favor of
[01:46:29.480 --> 01:46:34.760]  independence has won it's unofficial but there it is this is of course that has
[01:46:34.760 --> 01:46:37.760]  nothing to do with human rights it's because there's oil in the south and
[01:46:37.760 --> 01:46:41.720]  the central government in cartoon had been making deals with China and of
[01:46:41.720 --> 01:46:45.720]  course the the whole US posture was used the human rights story to kick the
[01:46:45.720 --> 01:46:50.520]  Chinese out use any story use al-qaeda use anything you can to kick the Chinese
[01:46:50.520 --> 01:46:59.480]  out so therefore if Egypt falls this would essentially mean a domino tsunami
[01:46:59.480 --> 01:47:04.480]  of destabilizations across North Africa the Arab world far beyond it would
[01:47:04.480 --> 01:47:09.280]  probably spell the the end of Pakistan as a centralized country would begin to
[01:47:09.280 --> 01:47:14.520]  reach into into Iraq into Iran right because the Bernard Lewis plan as it's
[01:47:14.520 --> 01:47:19.240]  called foresees the Balkanizations the carving of all of these places right
[01:47:19.240 --> 01:47:24.400]  three Iraq's five or six Iran's Lebanon carved Egypt gets carved it's Sudan
[01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:27.920]  being carved so they're going for that Balkanization along religious and
[01:47:27.920 --> 01:47:32.960]  racial lines but as you said it's not going well for them anywhere what does
[01:47:32.960 --> 01:47:38.600]  this signify that the banking empire using the US Israel England and others
[01:47:38.600 --> 01:47:46.440]  as muscle is finally stuck in the mud like Napoleon in Russia or Hitler in
[01:47:46.440 --> 01:47:51.400]  Russia or Barbarossa something like this in other words I did the world
[01:47:51.400 --> 01:47:55.480]  historical significance of this for me is it's important for the Anglo-American
[01:47:55.480 --> 01:47:59.840]  imperialists to be defeated in the attempt to overthrow this this government
[01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:03.880]  that's it's just that simple it's better for the world for the moment if this
[01:48:03.880 --> 01:48:08.200]  government stays into stays the way it is the status quo is better than what
[01:48:08.200 --> 01:48:12.680]  the Anglo-Americans would be offering so they've got one more big desperate push
[01:48:12.680 --> 01:48:16.200]  with this million people to overthrow the government tomorrow yes and I
[01:48:16.200 --> 01:48:19.440]  think it seems to me that they they just don't have it I mean I'm with I'm still
[01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:23.320]  looking at this Egyptian state television Al Jazeera doesn't know what to do
[01:48:23.320 --> 01:48:25.800]  because they've had their I mean they've had the reporters arrested which
[01:48:25.800 --> 01:48:30.120]  certainly shows that the honeymoon is over and that people are openly saying
[01:48:30.120 --> 01:48:35.160]  what Al Jazeera is British intel yeah I bet that's for sure and it's been
[01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:42.960]  raving foaming unbelievable propaganda right and these completely fake things
[01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:46.840]  you know that that Mubarak went to Egypt that that Kamal Mubarak is now in
[01:48:46.840 --> 01:48:52.720]  London that they're all fleeing like to try to to develop some hype the general
[01:48:52.720 --> 01:48:58.720]  idea though is that the the the increase the influence of China Russia would
[01:48:58.720 --> 01:49:02.440]  increase in the Middle East increase up to a point in other words the idea would
[01:49:02.440 --> 01:49:06.600]  be to have some situation where if the country didn't like the deal they were
[01:49:06.600 --> 01:49:09.840]  getting from the US they could say well if you're really going to be this
[01:49:09.840 --> 01:49:13.640]  unreasonable we're going to try the Chinese or the Russians or the Brazilians
[01:49:13.640 --> 01:49:18.240]  or the Venezuelans or or somebody somebody else this generally leads to a
[01:49:18.240 --> 01:49:24.920]  more stable world situation of it's not balance of power NASA was able to build
[01:49:24.920 --> 01:49:29.400]  the aswan high dam because he said to the US would you help me build it and
[01:49:29.400 --> 01:49:33.360]  John Foster dollars said no then he said well I'll get the Soviets to do it and
[01:49:33.360 --> 01:49:38.160]  they brought in an Italian engineering company and they built it so that's how
[01:49:38.160 --> 01:49:43.080]  you can you can get somewhere so I think it's it's the the unipolar world is
[01:49:43.080 --> 01:49:47.560]  beginning to crumble in some pretty key places the Middle East obviously being
[01:49:47.560 --> 01:49:53.640]  about as as key as you can look in Iraq the US wanted a la we the puppet of the
[01:49:53.640 --> 01:49:58.600]  US but they got Maliki who's much more pro-Iranian the government in Lebanon
[01:49:58.600 --> 01:50:04.600]  is not the US puppet but has bought out influence and if you look back then to
[01:50:04.600 --> 01:50:09.640]  Iran in the summer of 2009 that was supposed to be the the Twitter revolution
[01:50:09.640 --> 01:50:15.640]  it failed if the one in Egypt fails it means that the the entire destabilization
[01:50:15.640 --> 01:50:20.640]  which we've had since you know Marcos in the Philippines in the mid-80s since the
[01:50:20.640 --> 01:50:24.600]  Shah was overthrown because that's what that was to that that started that in
[01:50:24.600 --> 01:50:29.200]  and really what all the way through was promoted by the US by Carter and
[01:50:29.200 --> 01:50:32.960]  and Virginia and a lot of these backfire then we get the Islamic Revolution but
[01:50:32.960 --> 01:50:35.920]  it's admitted our government over through the Shah because he wanted to
[01:50:35.920 --> 01:50:39.360]  actually develop the country and they wanted the Islamic Revolution this was
[01:50:39.360 --> 01:50:42.920]  the whole point that if you get you get a certain kind of Islamic government they
[01:50:42.920 --> 01:50:49.680]  shut down the nuclear program which was what was done in 78 79 so they have a
[01:50:49.680 --> 01:50:53.960]  Stone Age policy for the world including here with their social Darwinistic
[01:50:53.960 --> 01:50:58.240]  Malthusian eugenics line we're gonna come back for two segments and take calls

[01:54:06.080 --> 01:54:10.320]  man I could talk to Tarpley for 10 hours we'll definitely have him back up soon to
[01:54:10.320 --> 01:54:14.480]  talk about what's happening domestically in this country in 30 seconds
[01:54:14.480 --> 01:54:19.520]  before we go to calls Tarpley what do you make of all the open announcements that
[01:54:19.520 --> 01:54:23.240]  oh the government's going to be changing the internet Google's going to be
[01:54:23.240 --> 01:54:27.840]  censoring alternative media for your own good the FCC is going to take over the
[01:54:27.840 --> 01:54:32.400]  internet and there is a kill switch for your own safety I mean are they really
[01:54:32.400 --> 01:54:37.040]  getting ready for full economic implosion it's perfectly possible now
[01:54:37.040 --> 01:54:40.520]  then obviously one of the things move our act did was was cutting off the
[01:54:40.520 --> 01:54:44.240]  internet and that for his purposes that seems to have been effective but of
[01:54:44.240 --> 01:54:48.680]  course these are like weapons right there in whose hands are they the US
[01:54:48.680 --> 01:54:52.880]  are the US is preparing these things anyway but now that that's been done
[01:54:52.880 --> 01:54:56.560]  against them then they keep they have an occasion to talk about it right to
[01:54:56.560 --> 01:55:02.000]  popularize this idea so obviously we don't want that here but Webster when
[01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:07.440]  you say US you mean the banking cartel that's capture it yes the people who
[01:55:07.440 --> 01:55:11.000]  control the Obama regime right and this is Wall Street as we've known over
[01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:14.280]  Obama's been a Wall Street puppet from the very beginning and of course large
[01:55:14.280 --> 01:55:18.800]  parts of the Republican Party are equally controlled by the Republic by the
[01:55:18.800 --> 01:55:23.360]  by the Wall Street people so the opposite obviously danger as long as you
[01:55:23.360 --> 01:55:26.480]  have the world descending into a depression you're going to have these
[01:55:26.480 --> 01:55:32.000]  these pressures towards authoritarian government and we have to resist these
[01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:36.080]  one of the things you see from from Egypt is that the way to avoid this is
[01:55:36.080 --> 01:55:39.760]  to have some kind of political organization and at least have people
[01:55:39.760 --> 01:55:44.120]  understanding what they need to do so that they're not simply sitting ducks
[01:55:44.120 --> 01:55:48.480]  exactly and that's what I try to do here is to get is to get people aware of how
[01:55:48.480 --> 01:55:51.920]  the world really works so they can recognize it when they see it let's go
[01:55:51.920 --> 01:55:55.000]  to Joe in Pennsylvania you're on the air Joe thanks for holding
[01:55:55.000 --> 01:56:00.840]  good afternoon there gentlemen I've been paying attention to the this like all
[01:56:00.840 --> 01:56:05.560]  weekend and I see a ray of like hoping for the people and fear for the
[01:56:05.560 --> 01:56:10.120]  governments the the people when they were riding the military they were
[01:56:10.120 --> 01:56:13.920]  coming out and they were actually embracing the people and they were like
[01:56:13.920 --> 01:56:16.560]  we didn't you know we don't want to do this is what we're ordered to do we're
[01:56:16.560 --> 01:56:21.800]  not gonna hurt you and and it was like you know Alex when you talk a lot about
[01:56:21.800 --> 01:56:26.640]  well our military martial law in this country ever happened with the military
[01:56:26.640 --> 01:56:32.320]  ever be able to go against the people and I think the the United States the
[01:56:32.320 --> 01:56:36.800]  people here are watching very closely to see how the military are interacting
[01:56:36.800 --> 01:56:44.000]  with the people to see if they will well that is true but the globalists would
[01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:48.800]  here have somebody shoot some of the military to then elicit them to attack
[01:56:48.800 --> 01:56:53.280]  the crown that's where false flags and staged events come in and there's some
[01:56:53.280 --> 01:56:57.040]  evidence in the Egyptian papers that indeed somebody's trying to get the
[01:56:57.040 --> 01:57:02.400]  military and the people fighting to enrage the crowds even more that
[01:57:02.400 --> 01:57:08.160]  provocateurs controlled by the West or by Mubarak are running around sabotaging
[01:57:08.160 --> 01:57:11.960]  things Tarpley what's your view on what Joe just brought up the difference is
[01:57:11.960 --> 01:57:17.280]  that the Egyptian army is a conscript army it's based on a draft and therefore
[01:57:17.280 --> 01:57:22.600]  it's not a bunch of professional killers it's it's a bunch of draftees so
[01:57:22.600 --> 01:57:25.520]  they're obviously not interested in shooting at the crowd then why should
[01:57:25.520 --> 01:57:29.080]  they because they it is very seldom come to such a point in other words the
[01:57:29.080 --> 01:57:32.840]  crowd have never been big enough or threatening enough the exception is a
[01:57:32.840 --> 01:57:37.800]  group of gunmen tried to attack the interior ministry that would be the
[01:57:37.800 --> 01:57:42.320]  Department of Justice FBI in our terms and then there was a gun battle but
[01:57:42.320 --> 01:57:47.440]  that seems to have been done by the police the the army leadership is loyal
[01:57:47.440 --> 01:57:52.000]  to Mubarak he's a military guy himself he's an Air Force pilot the new the new
[01:57:52.000 --> 01:58:00.320]  vice president is an Air Force pilot so the the the the army is now putting up
[01:58:00.320 --> 01:58:04.120]  these Jersey walls around the main squares they've taken a bunch of
[01:58:04.120 --> 01:58:08.160]  vehicles that have been burned and they've made those into sort of barricades
[01:58:08.160 --> 01:58:13.720]  so the army seems to be you know quietly effectively calming things down just
[01:58:13.720 --> 01:58:17.680]  the fact that all these tanks came into the square seems to have had a calming
[01:58:17.680 --> 01:58:22.800]  effect on everybody so far so in our media spotted that the jets were there
[01:58:22.800 --> 01:58:26.800]  to menace the people but the way that the the Egyptian government was like no
[01:58:26.800 --> 01:58:31.760]  you know this is a symbol of unity in the crowds cheered it a lot of
[01:58:31.760 --> 01:58:37.400]  strange dynamics Joe excellent point I hope our military would behave like the
[01:58:37.400 --> 01:58:43.880]  Egyptian military but who knows we'll be right back thank you for listening to
[01:58:43.880 --> 01:58:53.280]  GCN visit GCN Live.com today this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you
[01:58:53.280 --> 01:58:57.120]  should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate
[01:58:57.120 --> 01:59:01.120]  legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new
[01:59:01.120 --> 01:59:05.040]  energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[01:59:05.040 --> 01:59:09.240]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[01:59:09.240 --> 01:59:13.680]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[01:59:13.680 --> 01:59:18.440]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[01:59:18.440 --> 01:59:22.240]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[01:59:22.240 --> 01:59:25.880]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[01:59:25.880 --> 01:59:30.200]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup

[01:59:52.160 --> 02:00:06.760]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network big brother
[02:00:06.760 --> 02:00:14.080]  mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's
[02:00:14.080 --> 02:00:21.960]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[02:00:21.960 --> 02:00:28.560]  I've got a bunch of economic news health care news credit card rates going up to
[02:00:28.560 --> 02:00:33.000]  fifty nine point nine percent is Obama giving waivers down to members of
[02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:36.880]  Congress from the health care plan that's all coming up we're gonna have
[02:00:36.880 --> 02:00:40.920]  Max Kaiser on with us we'll continue with your calls so for those that are
[02:00:40.920 --> 02:00:45.840]  patiently holding but Patriot poet in Michigan you're on the year with Tarpley
[02:00:45.840 --> 02:00:51.360]  go ahead hello mr. Jones Mr. Tarpley how are you today we're good well what's
[02:00:51.360 --> 02:00:58.360]  on your mind there Patriot okay odd as far as the mass media I noticed I watched
[02:00:58.360 --> 02:01:05.160]  CNN and the mornings I don't watch any television news per se but you watch
[02:01:05.160 --> 02:01:10.680]  CNN what they say well they've been really pushing the visuals of the
[02:01:10.680 --> 02:01:18.000]  protesters burning things down carrying guns and you know showing how radical
[02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:27.560]  protesters are and somehow I think this is a way of trying to push their
[02:01:27.560 --> 02:01:33.440]  propaganda on the freaking people is it as in reference could this happen here
[02:01:33.440 --> 02:01:40.080]  and maybe around my way it's a way of keeping the fear factor at running at
[02:01:40.080 --> 02:01:47.080]  full capacity and in regards to the US my question is if they take away all the
[02:01:47.080 --> 02:01:52.600]  guns from legal lawful compliant gun owners only don't people don't have guns
[02:01:52.600 --> 02:01:56.320]  are the gangs of drug dealers the pins in the C no no I hear you and I appreciate
[02:01:56.320 --> 02:02:00.800]  your call it's a great point Webster how is the United States different because
[02:02:00.800 --> 02:02:05.280]  of the record ownership of guns for the establishment if they want to try some
[02:02:05.280 --> 02:02:11.680]  type of accelerated oppression or martial law scenario which we know they've been
[02:02:11.680 --> 02:02:17.600]  preparing for how will that wild card enter into things I'm not able to predict
[02:02:17.600 --> 02:02:21.440]  I would just say to people that the position of guns is fine right but the
[02:02:21.440 --> 02:02:26.200]  status quo I suppose is about that about right but the the idea that having a
[02:02:26.200 --> 02:02:30.040]  gun is a substitute for political action this is a this is a this is a big
[02:02:30.040 --> 02:02:35.640]  mistake I agree it becomes a political SAV or a pillow where people don't go get
[02:02:35.640 --> 02:02:39.880]  involved because they could have their gun home with your gun no that won't do
[02:02:39.880 --> 02:02:43.200]  it but you just in terms of the merit of the question which I think is real
[02:02:43.200 --> 02:02:47.120]  there's a lot of violence in this stuff right if you burn a bank in Greece
[02:02:47.120 --> 02:02:51.040]  you're a war criminal but if you burn down the Egyptian party headquarters
[02:02:51.040 --> 02:02:55.400]  you're a hero of democracy they burned the party headquarters they burned a
[02:02:55.400 --> 02:02:59.760]  very large building I'm not sure what it is but it's about a 15 story fairly
[02:02:59.760 --> 02:03:03.160]  modern building looks like you know it's sort of concrete on the outside all
[02:03:03.160 --> 02:03:08.080]  burned down lots of police stations burned down by these demonstrators right
[02:03:08.080 --> 02:03:12.840]  they did the vandalism at the Cairo Museum no they're targeting the
[02:03:12.840 --> 02:03:16.800]  infrastructure for total takeover and now the globalist admit you shouldn't
[02:03:16.800 --> 02:03:20.480]  George Soros he's been convicted in other countries he's trying to subvert
[02:03:20.480 --> 02:03:24.440]  freedom in this country he poses as a human rights activist isn't it time for
[02:03:24.440 --> 02:03:28.920]  Soros and a bunch of those Davos crooks to be arrested and along what lines
[02:03:28.920 --> 02:03:32.480]  tarpoli hey how about those Republicans if they're worth anything right our
[02:03:32.480 --> 02:03:35.800]  great heroes from the tea party who are now in the Congress why don't we get
[02:03:35.800 --> 02:03:40.240]  some hearings and and and drag in Soros and make him tell what he does right
[02:03:40.240 --> 02:03:44.560]  because this this example with the El Baraday this is a very good example that
[02:03:44.560 --> 02:03:48.240]  there are a lot of Republicans who don't like this international crisis group the
[02:03:48.240 --> 02:03:52.240]  way they see it is they they think that the international crisis group is
[02:03:52.240 --> 02:03:55.720]  anti-Israel I don't think this is true there's this guy Robert Malley for
[02:03:55.720 --> 02:04:00.200]  example right the main thing is that these people go in there in order to
[02:04:00.200 --> 02:04:03.720]  get anywhere in the Arab world you got to put up an anti-Israeli facade and then
[02:04:03.720 --> 02:04:07.280]  they begin to destabilize the country so why don't why don't some of these
[02:04:07.280 --> 02:04:12.240]  Republicans invite Soros to to testify in his international activities is he
[02:04:12.240 --> 02:04:16.280]  violating the what is it the Logan Act where you're making good but it's I mean
[02:04:16.280 --> 02:04:20.760]  it's illegal on so many fronts to be funding private revolutions all over
[02:04:20.760 --> 02:04:25.880]  the world I mean it's illegal what Soros does yes I think it may well be so
[02:04:25.880 --> 02:04:29.720]  that would be it would be interesting to look into but I think the the point is
[02:04:29.720 --> 02:04:34.440]  that I don't see any attempt of the US media to hype the violence the arson in
[02:04:34.440 --> 02:04:38.040]  the vandalism I see the opposite they try to tone that down compared to Greece

[02:08:12.640 --> 02:08:20.200]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[02:08:20.200 --> 02:08:28.360]  Texas Alex Jones one big thing we've learned from the crisis in Egypt is the
[02:08:28.360 --> 02:08:33.240]  government can't protect you same thing during Katrina same thing during these
[02:08:33.240 --> 02:08:37.640]  snowstorms it's not just that the government doesn't want to protect you
[02:08:37.640 --> 02:08:43.360]  which it doesn't most cases wants to feed off of you it's that they can't
[02:08:43.360 --> 02:08:47.400]  protect you and we need to be self-sufficient and take care of
[02:08:47.400 --> 02:08:55.040]  ourselves the Washington Times Fox News and others are reporting that members
[02:08:55.040 --> 02:08:59.760]  of Congress government bureaucrats and many others are now being given waivers
[02:08:59.760 --> 02:09:05.000]  from Obamacare you know McDonald's and hundreds of other companies they don't
[02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:09.680]  have to get health care for their employees but your company does that is
[02:09:09.680 --> 02:09:16.480]  such an incredible form of discrimination they've got us so trained to look
[02:09:16.480 --> 02:09:20.640]  for discrimination by whites against blacks or blacks against whites or
[02:09:20.640 --> 02:09:25.440]  other groups against each other that when we see government coming in and
[02:09:25.440 --> 02:09:30.160]  doing what tyrannical governments always do and giving special favors to
[02:09:30.160 --> 02:09:36.520]  their friends erecting laws to shut down their competition I mean this is
[02:09:36.520 --> 02:09:43.520]  outrageous and Congress is now moving for hearings along these lines but the
[02:09:43.520 --> 02:09:49.320]  Republicans a lot of their leadership likes this new power as well so the
[02:09:49.320 --> 02:09:53.320]  question is will they allow this to continue because it is just unspeakably
[02:09:53.320 --> 02:10:01.360]  illegal on on every front I mean this is mafia big Chicago you know a machine
[02:10:01.360 --> 02:10:13.120]  type politics that is going on right now continuing with some of the news that
[02:10:13.120 --> 02:10:20.240]  I've got here in front of me today US judge may escalate battle over health
[02:10:20.240 --> 02:10:26.080]  care reform judge would be a second to rule law unconstitutional and now I
[02:10:26.080 --> 02:10:32.080]  saw a map today more than 40 states have got lawsuits filed they've got their
[02:10:32.080 --> 02:10:37.760]  attorney generals moving against it the problem is Congress wouldn't pass the
[02:10:37.760 --> 02:10:44.480]  carbon tax last year and so the EPA came into Texas the biggest power
[02:10:44.480 --> 02:10:51.160]  producer in the US of the 50 states and unilaterally with no law behind them
[02:10:51.160 --> 02:10:56.240]  sees control the power plants regulatory process and said we're going to put
[02:10:56.240 --> 02:11:05.840]  these draconian controls on you even if we don't ever have a law backing it up
[02:11:05.840 --> 02:11:12.040]  just incredible so US judge may escalate battle over health care reform and the
[02:11:12.040 --> 02:11:17.120]  question is will Obama ignore Congress will he ignore the courts will he just
[02:11:17.120 --> 02:11:22.160]  do whatever he wants judge would be second to rule law unconstitutional
[02:11:22.160 --> 02:11:27.720]  a Florida judge could on Monday become the second US judge declared president
[02:11:27.720 --> 02:11:32.040]  Barack Obama's health care reform law unconstitutional in the biggest legal
[02:11:32.040 --> 02:11:38.440]  challenge yet to the federal authority to enact the law the judge Roger Vincent
[02:11:38.440 --> 02:11:44.960]  of the US district court of Pensacola Florida was expected to rule on a lawsuit
[02:11:44.960 --> 02:11:50.400]  brought by governors and attorney generals from 26 US states almost all of
[02:11:50.400 --> 02:11:56.600]  them are Republicans Obama is a Democrat the plaintiffs represent more than half
[02:11:56.600 --> 02:12:03.080]  the US state so the Pensacola case has more prominence and some two dozen
[02:12:03.080 --> 02:12:11.400]  lawsuits filed in federal courts over the health care law so very serious
[02:12:11.400 --> 02:12:17.360]  situation there now joining us from France is the inventor of the Hollywood
[02:12:17.360 --> 02:12:22.960]  stock exchange system the host of multiple international TV and radio shows
[02:12:22.960 --> 02:12:28.600]  if I got a Saturday morning show here on Genesis is Max Kaiser and I want to
[02:12:28.600 --> 02:12:33.880]  get into the Davos forum calling for 100 trillion and additional taxpayer money
[02:12:33.880 --> 02:12:40.120]  that they call liquidity or credit which they then loan back to us at loan
[02:12:40.120 --> 02:12:50.600]  sharking rates CNN is reporting 49.9 excuse me Freudian problem I wish it
[02:12:50.600 --> 02:13:02.480]  was only 49.9 59.9 percentage credit card cost and to boil this down trillions
[02:13:02.480 --> 02:13:05.200]  of dollars are pumped into private banks in the name of getting the economy
[02:13:05.200 --> 02:13:09.400]  started backed by taxpayers they've been loaded to governments corporations and
[02:13:09.400 --> 02:13:18.000]  individuals from between 5% and 59.9% free money made up out of nothing and
[02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:21.200]  that's why they want to shut industry down that's why they want this gulag
[02:13:21.200 --> 02:13:26.160]  casino economy that Max Kaiser talks so much about and it's funny because Max
[02:13:26.160 --> 02:13:30.400]  for at least three years on this show has talked about their model of a casino
[02:13:30.400 --> 02:13:35.480]  economy and and now we see the articles today calling for casinos as our new
[02:13:35.480 --> 02:13:41.120]  industry nationwide funded with taxpayer money and here's the headline the
[02:13:41.120 --> 02:13:47.760]  Facebook nation unveils its own currency so these digital currencies now that
[02:13:47.760 --> 02:13:52.120]  are basically a new form of slavery that trick you into being involved in it
[02:13:52.120 --> 02:13:57.360]  when it isn't even enough to you know buy a soda pop with every day we're gonna
[02:13:57.360 --> 02:14:02.800]  discuss the entire geopolitical events that are happening and get Max Kaiser's
[02:14:02.800 --> 02:14:07.600]  take on what's happening in the Middle East and North Africa as well Max good
[02:14:07.600 --> 02:14:14.160]  to have you here with us today I just threw out a little constellation of
[02:14:14.160 --> 02:14:18.360]  different issues there what's most important on your plate and what do you
[02:14:18.360 --> 02:14:23.600]  want to get into first well yeah the Davos as you and you've been talking
[02:14:23.600 --> 02:14:27.960]  about on your show this week before they the Davos started they floated this
[02:14:27.960 --> 02:14:36.080]  trial blend of increasing global credit by 100 trillion dollars and this plays
[02:14:36.080 --> 02:14:40.400]  into what I've been talking about on the show for a while because on your show
[02:14:40.400 --> 02:14:43.880]  you get a lot of people on and they talk about if they're going to be inflation
[02:14:43.880 --> 02:14:49.400]  or deflation and what I've said is that there's going to be a new global
[02:14:49.400 --> 02:14:54.200]  currency the US dollar and other currencies will be absorbed by the new
[02:14:54.200 --> 02:14:58.800]  currency so it won't be inflation deflation as such because the value the
[02:14:58.800 --> 02:15:03.280]  purchasing value of your new unit that you will get and when you swap your
[02:15:03.280 --> 02:15:09.080]  dollar will be roughly the same however it does mean that the US loses its
[02:15:09.080 --> 02:15:14.320]  sovereignty because you're exchanging your dollars for a global currency so
[02:15:14.320 --> 02:15:19.240]  before Davos they openly said that they want to float a hundred trillion worth
[02:15:19.240 --> 02:15:25.360]  of this new currency this would mean that all of the bad debts that can't be
[02:15:25.360 --> 02:15:32.080]  paid they securitize them as they've done before they create a new package and
[02:15:32.080 --> 02:15:39.200]  they roll them they roll them up in into a new debt-based package that's denominated
[02:15:39.200 --> 02:15:45.400]  in a new currency so it's imagine you know in America for example the whole
[02:15:45.400 --> 02:15:48.880]  problem in the real estate market is that they took a mortgage and they took a
[02:15:48.880 --> 02:15:53.080]  lot of mortgages and they created a mortgage-backed security and then they
[02:15:53.080 --> 02:15:57.600]  rolled that up into a derivatives contract and then that started the chain
[02:15:57.600 --> 02:16:02.400]  reaction of monetary meltdown in the US and so the global bankers are all making
[02:16:02.400 --> 02:16:07.320]  record profits the economy's in freefall and now they openly announced the new
[02:16:07.320 --> 02:16:12.560]  global SDR backed up by taxpayer money and so the bankers get all the power out
[02:16:12.560 --> 02:16:19.200]  of it we've got a stupid bow and kiss their their ring and they're the crooks
[02:16:19.200 --> 02:16:24.600]  that engineered the whole thing yeah they this does make an enormous amount of
[02:16:24.600 --> 02:16:28.320]  money for these bankers or you know they get that one or two percent fee on a
[02:16:28.320 --> 02:16:32.920]  $100 trillion piece of business you know this just this is how the banks of
[02:16:32.920 --> 02:16:36.960]  course make money the reason why there are so many derivatives in the system and
[02:16:36.960 --> 02:16:41.760]  why the debts are so extraordinary is because bankers get paid a percentage on
[02:16:41.760 --> 02:16:49.320]  that debt it's very similar if you will to the accounting you see in Hollywood a
[02:16:49.320 --> 02:16:54.560]  lot of people ask what's the point of making a 100 or 200 or 250 million
[02:16:54.560 --> 02:17:00.080]  dollar movie the point is that the producers get paid a fee not on how well
[02:17:00.080 --> 02:17:04.680]  a movie does but on how well the budget is how big the budget is so there's this
[02:17:04.680 --> 02:17:10.320]  always this push toward bigger budgets and stars getting bigger salaries because
[02:17:10.320 --> 02:17:15.920]  they get paid a fee based on the budget now similarly on the Wall Street they
[02:17:15.920 --> 02:17:19.160]  get paid not on performance they don't get paid and whether they make money or
[02:17:19.160 --> 02:17:24.440]  lose money or act in a fiduciary capacity they get paid on the 5 of the
[02:17:24.440 --> 02:17:30.040]  debt that they can roll forward and as all of the current debt collapse because
[02:17:30.040 --> 02:17:37.160]  the entire facade is one big Bernie Madoff like Ponzi scheme in order to keep
[02:17:37.160 --> 02:17:43.480]  this Ponzi scheme rolling they have to create a whole new layer and that layer
[02:17:43.480 --> 02:17:47.040]  will be this global currency and they're going to roll these and they said in
[02:17:47.040 --> 02:17:51.680]  Dallas it's a $100 trillion piece of business these the GDP of America is
[02:17:51.680 --> 02:17:58.040]  roughly 14 trillion the total GDP of the world is about 60 trillion so this
[02:17:58.040 --> 02:18:01.320]  there you have your numbers so they say well here's a hundred trillion dollars
[02:18:01.320 --> 02:18:06.840]  worth of this new global currency we're going to roll the yen the euro the
[02:18:06.840 --> 02:18:11.000]  dollar Canadian dollar paystone a few more of these currencies into this new
[02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:15.800]  global currency to a bird catastrophe and they'll use the same method they use
[02:18:15.800 --> 02:18:19.640]  in 2008 to get that three quarters of a trillion dollars in the pockets of
[02:18:19.640 --> 02:18:22.840]  Wall Street they said hang Paul Center for the Congress and they threatened to
[02:18:22.840 --> 02:18:27.480]  collapse the economy when they walked then his traders of Goldman Sachs the
[02:18:27.480 --> 02:18:32.480]  next day staged a financial terrorist attack they crashed the market they went
[02:18:32.480 --> 02:18:36.160]  back in front of Congress and they gave him his money so this is going to be the
[02:18:36.160 --> 02:18:41.200]  same deal now correct me if I'm wrong but if they want 100 trillion backed up
[02:18:41.200 --> 02:18:46.040]  by taxpayer money which they will then loan back to credit card holders
[02:18:46.040 --> 02:18:50.840]  governments the same bankers now are lowering countries counties cities
[02:18:50.840 --> 02:18:55.440]  states credit rating so they have to borrow the fiat money from the bankers
[02:18:55.440 --> 02:19:00.320]  for even more so the bankers get real assets but the bankers are also able to
[02:19:00.320 --> 02:19:06.320]  fractional reserve leverage the 100 trillion at least ten times out to one
[02:19:06.320 --> 02:19:11.360]  quadrillion or 1,000 trillion and that's even before they start
[02:19:11.360 --> 02:19:17.760]  pyramiding the debt with derivatives so this 100 trillion could potentially be
[02:19:17.760 --> 02:19:22.760]  how many thousands of trillions well you're right it's a thousand trillion
[02:19:22.760 --> 02:19:26.960]  or quadrillion but we already have that quadrillion number right now as you
[02:19:26.960 --> 02:19:31.040]  know the notional value of derivatives transactors according to the Bank of
[02:19:31.040 --> 02:19:34.800]  International Fetal with last year was roughly six hundred trillion dollars
[02:19:34.800 --> 02:19:39.440]  almost a quadrillion right there so you're absolutely right they they would
[02:19:39.440 --> 02:19:45.080]  need a 100 trillion and fresh meat you know fresh currency that they can use to
[02:19:45.080 --> 02:19:51.080]  roll up as this massive re-architecture of the global economy and it would
[02:19:51.080 --> 02:19:56.280]  result in them controlling on the back end a quadrillion worth of
[02:19:56.280 --> 02:19:59.920]  stay there stay there and of course everyone will kill them kill their own
[02:19:59.920 --> 02:20:07.840]  family for the money this is not a drill repeat this is not a drill gun cells
[02:20:07.840 --> 02:20:11.560]  are on a staggering pace gun prices are going through the roof and that means
[02:20:11.560 --> 02:20:16.120]  desperate vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get

[02:24:42.640 --> 02:24:48.160]  Max Kaiser here in a moment but but Max I'm not a rocket scientist I'm not a
[02:24:48.160 --> 02:24:52.800]  brain surgeon I'm not the inventor of a stock exchange you know predictive system
[02:24:52.800 --> 02:24:57.200]  like you are but I've studied history I know what really destroyed Rome was
[02:24:57.200 --> 02:25:01.200]  currency devaluation what destroyed the Weimar Republic Germany what's
[02:25:01.200 --> 02:25:07.880]  destroyed economically a Zimbabwe I mean I understand basic facts of economics
[02:25:07.880 --> 02:25:11.800]  and and the globalists know this and I've read their white papers that are
[02:25:11.800 --> 02:25:16.120]  public they want a tyrannical world government they want one-child policies
[02:25:16.120 --> 02:25:21.160]  they want all this tyranny they want to make us debt slaves they're setting up
[02:25:21.160 --> 02:25:25.360]  their world government still yuppies giggle because they were preconditioned
[02:25:25.360 --> 02:25:29.840]  that that didn't exist I mean at a certain point we've just got to get the
[02:25:29.840 --> 02:25:35.040]  word out and identify these can lay burning made-off types and call for
[02:25:35.040 --> 02:25:38.920]  them to be brought to justice they've sold derivatives they've sold counterfeit
[02:25:38.920 --> 02:25:45.160]  they are swindlers that make Ponzi look like an angel and it's either us or
[02:25:45.160 --> 02:25:49.520]  them they're clearly financing terrorists as a pretext to take our
[02:25:49.520 --> 02:25:54.800]  liberties clearly we've got to bring them to justice for buying off our
[02:25:54.800 --> 02:25:59.960]  politicians for engaging in economic espionage it's either us or them what
[02:25:59.960 --> 02:26:04.000]  is the state of the world right now how are the globalists doing because it
[02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:07.800]  looks like they're having some problems as they try to eat the elephant of the
[02:26:07.800 --> 02:26:14.360]  ones free and independent planet and where do you see all this basically
[02:26:14.360 --> 02:26:19.080]  ending up and what do all of us you know out there listening need to do to really
[02:26:19.080 --> 02:26:24.200]  get aggressive and ensure that as things implode further folks know who to blame
[02:26:24.200 --> 02:26:29.200]  because these bankers who've engineered this on record are spreading their
[02:26:29.200 --> 02:26:34.520]  filthy wings over us telling us that they're a mama chicken you know wanting
[02:26:34.520 --> 02:26:39.200]  to keep us safe when in reality they're buzzards they're they're they're vultures
[02:26:39.200 --> 02:26:46.040]  they're they're carrion eaters we know you had on your site a fantastic video and
[02:26:46.040 --> 02:26:50.760]  I watched the whole thing was welcome to the reservation by I guess it Russell
[02:26:50.760 --> 02:26:58.000]  means yes and then this is an important video to watch because this is the
[02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:05.600]  agenda is effectively put people on to the new reservation and as we know the
[02:27:05.600 --> 02:27:09.840]  homelessness in America is skyrocketing and these ones these people fall off the
[02:27:09.840 --> 02:27:13.480]  grid they become homeless they also become forgotten and the reason you
[02:27:13.480 --> 02:27:17.160]  don't hear about the problem is because these people are on the margins are
[02:27:17.160 --> 02:27:21.920]  living in 10 cities and they're just worried day-to-day survival and this is
[02:27:21.920 --> 02:27:25.440]  the new reservation and the same people who created their first reservations that
[02:27:25.440 --> 02:27:31.960]  they rolled across America and they put forth a business model that was not very
[02:27:31.960 --> 02:27:36.680]  sustainable they ran out of space in America they ran out of space in other
[02:27:36.680 --> 02:27:40.760]  countries so they're going coming back to America and they're rolling back
[02:27:40.760 --> 02:27:45.640]  through again and anybody is middle-class or lower-class is being
[02:27:45.640 --> 02:27:50.080]  essentially disenfranchised and put on reservations or they end up in the
[02:27:50.080 --> 02:27:55.200]  prison system or they end up in what we call the casino gulag system and what
[02:27:55.200 --> 02:28:00.360]  will be left is more for the people who are doing this and on the problem is
[02:28:00.360 --> 02:28:06.080]  that for those he to get a good critical math of resistance it's difficult
[02:28:06.080 --> 02:28:10.960]  because every time people are pushed out of the out of the system and off the
[02:28:10.960 --> 02:28:15.840]  grid they end up kind of you know off the grid you know and it becomes
[02:28:15.840 --> 02:28:20.000]  difficult to rally them and then their whole life becomes one of surviving for
[02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:23.600]  existence you know the founding fathers of the United States they were not
[02:28:23.600 --> 02:28:29.080]  people living hand-to-mouth they were the yuppies of that century who became
[02:28:29.080 --> 02:28:35.880]  this you know they started thought that they could create a better country and
[02:28:35.880 --> 02:28:42.560]  they did yeah instead of having you know a cool hairstyle you know to show how
[02:28:42.560 --> 02:28:47.560]  cool they were they started a country and now our heroes are basketball players
[02:28:47.560 --> 02:28:54.280]  and tattoo artists and people that act cool instead of being cool and actually
[02:28:54.280 --> 02:28:57.640]  knowing how the world works and being involved and I'm not bashing folks that
[02:28:57.640 --> 02:29:02.280]  have where cowboy hats or have green hair or have tattoos I don't care the
[02:29:02.280 --> 02:29:06.640]  point is we've been taught that that's how you rebel no you rebel by being
[02:29:06.640 --> 02:29:11.880]  informed and taking your country back and for me max it's how criminal the
[02:29:11.880 --> 02:29:17.240]  banks are it's how outrageously obvious it is and still I just hear the
[02:29:17.240 --> 02:29:21.520]  ignorance out there on the streets okay well look at what's happening and bring
[02:29:21.520 --> 02:29:25.480]  it on a global basis here because we've often said on your show that it's a
[02:29:25.480 --> 02:29:30.240]  global thing and the locals happening in Cairo and Egypt now the root of these
[02:29:30.240 --> 02:29:35.720]  problems particularly in Egypt it's the price of food has recently skyrocketed
[02:29:35.720 --> 02:29:40.640]  because of these bankers because of what they've been doing in manipulating these
[02:29:40.640 --> 02:29:44.080]  food prices I'll tell you what max stay there I want to get into Cairo next that
[02:29:44.080 --> 02:29:52.000]  was my next issue and strangely enough a top banker agrees with you we're on the
[02:29:52.000 --> 02:30:02.320]  march the empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network Alex told you
[02:30:02.320 --> 02:30:06.080]  the government announced recently that the recession is over it ended on June
[02:30:06.080 --> 02:30:11.440]  of 2009 the millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree perhaps a
[02:30:11.440 --> 02:30:14.760]  recession ended for the bankers and government employees but for the rest
[02:30:14.760 --> 02:30:18.400]  of us things seem to be getting worse gold and silver haven't heard the news
[02:30:18.400 --> 02:30:22.640]  either they've begun their long expected journey to the moon in addition to
[02:30:22.640 --> 02:30:26.200]  converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver you should consider a

[02:35:45.640 --> 02:35:51.520]  that's Obama kill switch three words going back to Max Kaiser Max you were
[02:35:51.520 --> 02:35:57.440]  starting to get into the Cairo situation and headline former managing director of
[02:35:57.440 --> 02:36:05.320]  Goldman Sachs Egyptians Greeks Tunisians protest against the pillaging of their
[02:36:05.320 --> 02:36:10.880]  economies and it goes on to report here that the Goldman Sachs head of the
[02:36:10.880 --> 02:36:17.560]  international analytics group of Bear Stearns is reporting that this is being
[02:36:17.560 --> 02:36:23.320]  caused by the big central banks driving down the value of the dollar and hence
[02:36:23.320 --> 02:36:29.320]  making it harder for Egyptians to buy food. Yeah well you know the price of
[02:36:29.320 --> 02:36:37.520]  food in Cairo is rising and if people only have two or three days left of
[02:36:37.520 --> 02:36:42.120]  food and the crisis really becomes one of starvation and this is playing out all
[02:36:42.120 --> 02:36:46.320]  over North America and you know the reason the price of food is going higher
[02:36:46.320 --> 02:36:50.840]  is not because demand suddenly increased by a hundred percent in the last year or
[02:36:50.840 --> 02:36:55.360]  two that's not the case at all. The reason the prices are moving up is
[02:36:55.360 --> 02:37:01.440]  because the supply the supply of easy money the supply of cheap money and the
[02:37:01.440 --> 02:37:07.320]  direct consequence of the what happened in 2008 we talked about it when when
[02:37:07.320 --> 02:37:10.640]  when Hank Paulson went to the front of Congress they got three quarters of a
[02:37:10.640 --> 02:37:15.400]  trillion dollars that three quarters of a trillion dollars it ended up being
[02:37:15.400 --> 02:37:20.160]  circulated not in the US economy because if it did we would have seen Job
[02:37:20.160 --> 02:37:23.440]  growth we would have seen real estate prices moving higher but we haven't so
[02:37:23.440 --> 02:37:28.360]  where did it go it went into the speculative global speculators pockets
[02:37:28.360 --> 02:37:33.480]  who are using it to bid up the price of agricultural products like food and as
[02:37:33.480 --> 02:37:38.840]  a result the people who authorized that huge check back in 2008 have a direct
[02:37:38.840 --> 02:37:44.640]  relationship on this starvation crisis happening all across northern Africa and
[02:37:44.640 --> 02:37:49.400]  it also has a direct bearing on the catastrophe in the economies of Ireland
[02:37:49.400 --> 02:37:54.680]  and Greece so it's becoming a global problem because all of those trillions
[02:37:54.680 --> 02:38:02.600]  that were printed up at gunpoint in 2008 as part of the heist that was
[02:38:02.600 --> 02:38:06.560]  conducted in Congress is this is this is the result now of it two years later
[02:38:06.560 --> 02:38:10.360]  it's causing food prices they had all-time new highs which is causing
[02:38:10.360 --> 02:38:16.120]  revolts rebellion starvation and and it's and it's a global what I call the
[02:38:16.120 --> 02:38:20.680]  global insurrection it is now occurring so the people in Cairo and Egypt have
[02:38:20.680 --> 02:38:24.880]  common cause with the people in Athens and the people in Dublin who have common
[02:38:24.880 --> 02:38:29.000]  cause now with anyone in the US anyone in the US it feels like they're getting
[02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:33.720]  the short end of the stick you know you you are in the same boat as the people
[02:38:33.720 --> 02:38:36.600]  in Cairo and the people in Egypt the people in Dublin and Athens it's a
[02:38:36.600 --> 02:38:41.520]  global problem and it's the same global bankers you know the same elite bankers
[02:38:41.520 --> 02:38:46.280]  are causing us and their interests are quite obvious they when they make
[02:38:46.280 --> 02:38:51.160]  speculative bets on these agricultural prices driving them through incredible
[02:38:51.160 --> 02:38:55.520]  highs they make money what happens if they make a mistake well if they make a
[02:38:55.520 --> 02:38:59.200]  mistake they go to the government and get more bailout but it's more than that
[02:38:59.200 --> 02:39:04.520]  max we've got internal documents over the years they plan for making profits on
[02:39:04.520 --> 02:39:08.120]  the way up and then on the implosion when everything goes down to pennies on
[02:39:08.120 --> 02:39:14.200]  the dollar or the pound or the sdr buying things up I mean here's the
[02:39:14.200 --> 02:39:18.760]  headline and it's up at prisonplanet.com former managing director of
[02:39:18.760 --> 02:39:23.760]  Goldman Sachs Egyptians Greeks Tunisians and British are all protesting
[02:39:23.760 --> 02:39:28.320]  against pillaging of their economies let me read part of this Nomi Prince
[02:39:28.320 --> 02:39:32.320]  former managing director of Goldman Sachs and the head of the International
[02:39:32.320 --> 02:39:36.760]  Analytics Group at Bear Stearns in London notes that the Egyptian people are
[02:39:36.760 --> 02:39:41.040]  rebelling against being pillaged by giant international banks and their own
[02:39:41.040 --> 02:39:45.720]  governments as much as anything else she also points out that the Greek
[02:39:45.720 --> 02:39:51.000]  British Tunisian and other protesters are all in the same boat and this is her
[02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:55.600]  quote the ongoing demonstrations in Egypt are as much if not more about the
[02:39:55.600 --> 02:39:59.880]  mass deterioration of economic conditions and the harsh result of years of
[02:39:59.880 --> 02:40:04.320]  financial degradations that the political ideology that some of the media
[02:40:04.320 --> 02:40:09.840]  seems more focused on and they go on to break down how IMF World Bank policies
[02:40:09.840 --> 02:40:14.160]  are causing what's happening there and so the issue here is we have this
[02:40:14.160 --> 02:40:18.120]  unnatural event where these aren't bankers that hold your money they call
[02:40:18.120 --> 02:40:22.920]  themselves bankers these are con artists who can create any amount of
[02:40:22.920 --> 02:40:27.280]  currency or credit they want and then they use that unfair trade advantage to
[02:40:27.280 --> 02:40:32.720]  take over all of society and and it's again it's brazen it's a fraud and
[02:40:32.720 --> 02:40:40.000]  these greedy creatures have to be dealt with period the phrase currency war as
[02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:46.880]  it is just that the US is printing trillion to go into these economies to
[02:40:46.880 --> 02:40:52.000]  disrupt them as a form of neocolonialism they are looking to control these
[02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:58.360]  economies and they're looking to take property from these economies for
[02:40:58.360 --> 02:41:02.480]  example Ireland has natural resources they've got energy resources they've
[02:41:02.480 --> 02:41:07.840]  got 20 billion dollars in cash on the books the IMF is bankrupt but they're
[02:41:07.840 --> 02:41:13.320]  caught they're putting up the assets of Ireland as collateral to raise money to
[02:41:13.320 --> 02:41:18.640]  go and buy Ireland and then they'll sell off some assets and keep the rest so it's
[02:41:18.640 --> 02:41:23.960]  a levered rate it's a hostile rate of a country by an international organization
[02:41:23.960 --> 02:41:28.760]  the IMF Ireland itself is fine they can pay out plenty of cash to go for two or
[02:41:28.760 --> 02:41:32.600]  three more years to work out their problem but the IMF decided that they're
[02:41:32.600 --> 02:41:35.640]  going to get moody's and these other rating agencies who work with them to
[02:41:35.640 --> 02:41:40.400]  downgrade the bond a sudden link yes so that there's a huge crisis in the bond
[02:41:40.400 --> 02:41:43.960]  market and they come in with a package of loans that they themselves
[02:41:43.960 --> 02:41:47.720]  collateralized by the assets of the country that they're taking over and by
[02:41:47.720 --> 02:41:52.800]  the way max IMF itself is bankrupt they have no money and before I jump in
[02:41:52.800 --> 02:41:57.080]  here know me print she was just on my show talking about Facebook and Goldman
[02:41:57.080 --> 02:42:00.640]  fact I just sent you a link to a video three and a half minutes it just came out
[02:42:00.640 --> 02:42:05.600]  on the web at 30 minutes ago it's hot you got to play it because she's brilliant
[02:42:05.600 --> 02:42:09.520]  and to get into this Facebook Goldman fact scam people have got to hear this I
[02:42:09.520 --> 02:42:13.400]  just sent it to Matt but Matt is out in the parking lot or something you got to
[02:42:13.400 --> 02:42:17.720]  get him back inside so so no they've been scrambling to get it for for ten
[02:42:17.720 --> 02:42:21.840]  minutes since you told them and and certainly will play that going into
[02:42:21.840 --> 02:42:28.120]  overdrive so your your television show airs on coming up here in a few days
[02:42:28.120 --> 02:42:33.800]  this hasn't even been been seen yet but this show won't air until tomorrow this
[02:42:33.800 --> 02:42:38.760]  is a clip that we're getting a hot exclusive well I tell you what exclusive
[02:42:38.760 --> 02:42:43.320]  exactly well we appreciate that she's she I agree with everything she just said
[02:42:43.320 --> 02:42:48.200]  it mean we're on the same page here the the problems in Cairo Egypt and in
[02:42:48.200 --> 02:42:52.800]  Europe are the result of banker abuse as we've been saying for a few years and
[02:42:52.800 --> 02:43:01.080]  and the US it is is slow to react because the US dollar is still the world
[02:43:01.080 --> 02:43:04.240]  reserve currency which means the US can write checks that never caches which
[02:43:04.240 --> 02:43:07.960]  means that the price of oil the price of food relatively speaking are cheap
[02:43:07.960 --> 02:43:13.200]  people can still go to Walmart for five bucks and you know get a taco and a
[02:43:13.200 --> 02:43:18.720]  gallon of gas but that's changing because the overall flood of this money
[02:43:18.720 --> 02:43:23.720]  especially to go to a hundred trillion dollar bailout of the globe that means
[02:43:23.720 --> 02:43:28.240]  prices around the world means currency collapse or roll up into the new
[02:43:28.240 --> 02:43:33.160]  currency and then that's going to devalue very quickly I mean all of this is
[02:43:33.160 --> 02:43:37.560]  telescoping down now where they're just rolling it over into new instruments but
[02:43:37.560 --> 02:43:42.000]  still trying to take on the weight of the derivatives they've created exactly
[02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:45.280]  and once they roll it into this new instrument and you point make a good
[02:43:45.280 --> 02:43:48.600]  point here once they roll it and they'll say well your purchasing power is the
[02:43:48.600 --> 02:43:53.960]  same but you lose your sovereignty then the next 100 trillion or 200 trillion is
[02:43:53.960 --> 02:43:56.640]  easy to do because you don't have to answer to anybody but yourself and then
[02:43:56.640 --> 02:43:59.400]  you have the hyperinflation then you have the currency collapse then you have
[02:43:59.400 --> 02:44:03.000]  the casino gulag then you have what we've been talking about and it's
[02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:06.360]  happening in real time it's not we're no longer on the edge we're now
[02:44:06.360 --> 02:44:11.280]  entering Cairo Egypt Dublin happens this is happening right now the US is the
[02:44:11.280 --> 02:44:16.040]  last to go because it's got the World Reserve currency but that will once that
[02:44:16.040 --> 02:44:20.000]  changes that I've said on your show many times it's not inflation or deflation
[02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:24.800]  it's it's the new currency global currency and even Jim Rickerts who is at
[02:44:24.800 --> 02:44:29.160]  Davos and tweeting from Davos there are very close contacts in Davos they've
[02:44:29.160 --> 02:44:33.440]  the word in Davos is not necessary it's not inflation or deflation it's
[02:44:33.440 --> 02:44:38.320]  recapitalization using a new global facility all right tell us about this
[02:44:38.320 --> 02:44:44.680]  former Goldman Sachs director that you interviewed yes that we're about to
[02:44:44.680 --> 02:44:50.120]  premiere here and why this is so important well on our show we've talked
[02:44:50.120 --> 02:44:55.080]  about the casino gulag when the emergence of this new virtual currency
[02:44:55.080 --> 02:44:58.800]  and of course Facebook's a huge player Facebook just said that they're going to
[02:44:58.800 --> 02:45:03.360]  demand everyone who does business on their site but in the gaming space
[02:45:03.360 --> 02:45:06.920]  including things like Farmville and all the other games that use virtual
[02:45:06.920 --> 02:45:13.160]  currencies have to all consolidate into one master virtual Facebook currency
[02:45:13.160 --> 02:45:17.400]  which will then be convertible to US dollars so you work in 15 hours a day
[02:45:17.400 --> 02:45:22.360]  growing virtual vegetables on Farmville to get a 15 billion Facebook cards that
[02:45:22.360 --> 02:45:26.920]  are convertible and you predicted this two years ago and now they've got a
[02:45:26.920 --> 02:45:31.960]  Goldman Sachs deal I mean you really know what's going on inside their brains
[02:45:31.960 --> 02:45:37.200]  sure because I work there and I worked in the virtual credit and space and I
[02:45:37.200 --> 02:45:42.400]  have a technology as you point out the invented a lot of the technology that
[02:45:42.400 --> 02:45:46.960]  goes into this so I'm I know this space very very well and you have a company
[02:45:46.960 --> 02:45:50.680]  like Zynga which does the virtual currency it's worth many billions of
[02:45:50.680 --> 02:45:55.280]  dollars Facebook's worth 50 billion so anyway Goldman Sachs just put a huge
[02:45:55.280 --> 02:45:59.840]  investment into Facebook and they just said this company's worth 50 billion
[02:45:59.840 --> 02:46:06.760]  dollars now as part of that deal Goldman Sachs blatantly broke SEC rules and this
[02:46:06.760 --> 02:46:10.320]  is the subject of what I brought up with now we print in the clip that you're
[02:46:10.320 --> 02:46:14.920]  about to play talking about the brazenness of Goldman breaking the law
[02:46:14.920 --> 02:46:19.040]  and the track record of Goldman breaking the law and you should play it
[02:46:19.040 --> 02:46:23.680]  because it's an excellent clip we'll go ahead and play that clip right now here
[02:46:23.680 --> 02:46:28.040]  it is Max Kaiser with his gas former managing director at Goldman Sachs
[02:46:28.040 --> 02:46:34.680]  talking about a fraud-esque like moment that's happening in the present and
[02:46:34.680 --> 02:46:40.280]  this is the Goldman Sachs Facebook deal you why is it worse than the crappy CDOs
[02:46:40.280 --> 02:46:44.440]  that Goldman was admittedly selling referring back to what we were just
[02:46:44.440 --> 02:46:48.880]  talking about Phyllis in on this latest scandal all of this is a spin on the
[02:46:48.880 --> 02:46:54.600]  investment bank knowing more than what it is letting on to to the investors and
[02:46:54.600 --> 02:46:58.040]  trading on the back of that or being able to trade on the back of it and so
[02:46:58.040 --> 02:47:02.640]  therefore being able to profit on the back of withholding information and to
[02:47:02.640 --> 02:47:08.120]  large extent the Facebook deal was like that it's it's a private deal so it
[02:47:08.120 --> 02:47:13.720]  doesn't fully fall under the same public purview and rules as as insider
[02:47:13.720 --> 02:47:19.200]  trading per se but what Goldman basically did was raise a lot of capital and
[02:47:19.200 --> 02:47:22.640]  they just went offshore to raise this capital because of the scrutiny that was
[02:47:22.640 --> 02:47:26.200]  put on this deal in the United States I like to think also by some of the
[02:47:26.200 --> 02:47:30.000]  articles I and others were writing and they didn't want to be bothered and so
[02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:33.800]  they went and they raised money for this Facebook deal offshore and the reason
[02:47:33.800 --> 02:47:38.920]  it's shady in that respect is because Facebook in the course of this deal and
[02:47:38.920 --> 02:47:42.360]  yes it is private has not really disclosed the information as to how it
[02:47:42.360 --> 02:47:48.000]  ticks financially Facebook will not disclose this information until 2012 so
[02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:53.280]  basically 14 months after investors have succumbed into going into this deal
[02:47:53.280 --> 02:47:58.200]  and have worked with Goldman to raise capital to basically allow Facebook to
[02:47:58.200 --> 02:48:03.120]  be valued at $50 billion as opposed to the $10 billion that it was valued at
[02:48:03.120 --> 02:48:07.440]  just a year ago and the way Goldman has kind of structured the deal is they
[02:48:07.440 --> 02:48:11.960]  put in some seed money which is how CDOs work CDOs always worked on the basis of
[02:48:11.960 --> 02:48:15.320]  the investment bank would put in some money some hedge food would put in some
[02:48:15.320 --> 02:48:19.160]  money and that would entice other investors to follow along you know there
[02:48:19.160 --> 02:48:22.680]  was there was a cushion there someone was giving at a stamp of approval which
[02:48:22.680 --> 02:48:25.680]  is sort of what's happening with this Facebook deal now it's very possible that
[02:48:25.680 --> 02:48:30.800]  Facebook is the be all end all in 2012 and 2013 when Goldman's investors are
[02:48:30.800 --> 02:48:33.920]  actually allowed to get out of the deal Goldman of course can get out of the
[02:48:33.920 --> 02:48:39.160]  deal at any time as they could with the CDO but you know it's also likely or
[02:48:39.160 --> 02:48:42.840]  possible that that won't be the case and the investors in this deal are paying
[02:48:42.840 --> 02:48:47.800]  10% to Goldman in the case that is it even occurs that their value goes up in
[02:48:47.800 --> 02:48:51.480]  this deal when they can get out and fees to Goldman in order to structure the
[02:48:51.480 --> 02:48:55.120]  deal and allow them to be involved in it in the first place and I think the fact
[02:48:55.120 --> 02:48:58.160]  that they went offshore and they had to get outside investors from the United
[02:48:58.160 --> 02:49:03.800]  States is very telling yeah but wait a second here because the law is that to
[02:49:03.800 --> 02:49:10.400]  to if you get more than 500 investors you need some additional disclosure what
[02:49:10.400 --> 02:49:15.880]  Goldman Sachs did was they decided to invent a new concept which was that they
[02:49:15.880 --> 02:49:19.960]  took one of those shares or one of those holders and they split it into a
[02:49:19.960 --> 02:49:26.920]  holding which would allow others to participate and that's an idea that they
[02:49:26.920 --> 02:49:31.960]  should have gotten the SEC's opinion on before they went to the market and and
[02:49:31.960 --> 02:49:38.080]  breached what is the standing legal statute they breached the law I mean
[02:49:38.080 --> 02:49:43.000]  that's not the way the law reads so why can't they get an SEC opinion first why
[02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:47.080]  is it always on Wall Street they break the law first and then they say well
[02:49:47.080 --> 02:49:51.240]  we're gonna go ahead anyway and it's up to you to change the law they're always
[02:49:51.240 --> 02:49:55.480]  wanting people to change the law what about obeying the law absolutely but the
[02:49:55.480 --> 02:50:01.920]  thing is it works for them all right and that's coming up on Friday on his
[02:50:01.920 --> 02:50:05.760]  Russia Today program premiering that here with us we're thankful for that
[02:50:05.760 --> 02:50:10.640]  information but this is insider trading insider trading they're creating their
[02:50:10.640 --> 02:50:15.080]  own fiat markets and then not even disclosing and then only allowing
[02:50:15.080 --> 02:50:22.000]  insiders to get in this reminds me of Goldman Sachs selling bad packages of
[02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:26.760]  housing loans to their customers and telling them it was a great deal while
[02:50:26.760 --> 02:50:32.680]  writing internal emails about how it was absolute crud and then meanwhile the
[02:50:32.680 --> 02:50:38.000]  SEC only goes after the competition of the big mega brokerage houses for a
[02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:42.520]  crooked toenail but they're allowed to engage in bloody murder this is all up
[02:50:42.520 --> 02:50:46.680]  at info wars dot com prison planet dot com and Max Kaiser dot com we're gonna
[02:50:46.680 --> 02:50:51.960]  come back get Max Kaiser's take on that video and then if Max can do it I got

[02:54:58.120 --> 02:55:01.800]  of the web but if it'll get conservatives hopping mad and trying to
[02:55:01.800 --> 02:55:06.040]  stop it if we put Obama's name on it sure enough there you go
[02:55:06.040 --> 02:55:11.400]  Obama's kill switch whoo scary and in a way he is the one pushing it and cast
[02:55:11.400 --> 02:55:17.080]  Sunstein an open authoritarian Max why as long as somebody prances around and
[02:55:17.080 --> 02:55:22.680]  speaks with a lisp is it okay if they call for authoritarian things if they
[02:55:22.680 --> 02:55:27.560]  prance around speak with a lisp and say that they're liberal why can they then
[02:55:27.560 --> 02:55:34.560]  call for things that can only be called Stalinist or Hitlerian what's the
[02:55:34.560 --> 02:55:47.240]  issue behind that yes we're live I'll tell you I just saw something that's
[02:55:47.240 --> 02:55:53.000]  very interesting Canada you know they are have introduced metered internet
[02:55:53.000 --> 02:55:57.160]  talking about the internet metered internet because this is that issue of
[02:55:57.160 --> 02:56:02.440]  net neutrality that was my next subject for you was actually here in my stack
[02:56:02.440 --> 02:56:07.760]  dealing with the yeah let me continue I'll talk you listen so again Canada is
[02:56:07.760 --> 02:56:11.920]  bringing in this internet metered internet that's gonna charge people
[02:56:11.920 --> 02:56:17.080]  premium for content so you know the whole beauty of the internet is that it's
[02:56:17.080 --> 02:56:22.920]  this great democratic meritocratic point-to-point open in network is being
[02:56:22.920 --> 02:56:26.520]  destroyed as they want to turn into cable television that you're gonna pay
[02:56:26.520 --> 02:56:30.400]  through the nose for and all of the ability for it to be used for social
[02:56:30.400 --> 02:56:34.720]  networking in terms of you know getting people together to assemble to fight
[02:56:34.720 --> 02:56:40.000]  back against the media who are that'll only be allowed on insider sites like
[02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:47.160]  Facebook and here it is a 200 gigabyte to 25 gigabyte Canada gets first bitter
[02:56:47.160 --> 02:56:53.000]  dose of metered internet that is internet to and Google announced last week for
[02:56:53.000 --> 02:56:56.960]  those that don't know that don't get folks the full spectrum here that they
[02:56:56.960 --> 02:57:01.080]  are gonna start blocking alternative sites what's happened is max we are
[02:57:01.080 --> 02:57:05.600]  kicking their hind in and their lies because we have the truth and so they're
[02:57:05.600 --> 02:57:09.920]  not gonna play fair they're coming in sucking their thumb mainstream media
[02:57:09.920 --> 02:57:14.360]  going government come in and shut down Alex Jones and Max Kaiser and drudge

[02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:33.340]  happened to open markets oh they've been taken over by the oligarch in the
[02:57:33.340 --> 02:57:36.320]  banking sector here's another interesting headline you know that China
[02:57:36.320 --> 02:57:40.480]  apparently is getting ready to run a candidate in the US this is a headline
[02:57:40.480 --> 02:57:44.880]  for the Manchurian candidate White House expects ambassador from China to
[02:57:44.880 --> 02:57:51.520]  explore a 2012 president presidential bid excuse me excuse me it's gotten that
[02:57:51.520 --> 02:57:55.800]  obvious we're gonna have a Chinese dictator as our leader guys yes where is

[02:57:59.680 --> 02:58:04.200]  mean you're talking about all I was just asking you the headline Chinese
[02:58:04.200 --> 02:58:09.240]  ambassador to explore man you're down there in Austin you're like 24 hours
[02:58:09.240 --> 02:58:13.760]  behind the news curve I'm giving you the route to date stuff I had the story
[02:58:13.760 --> 02:58:18.760]  yesterday about the meters in Canada and I had it five years ago that Canada was
[02:58:18.760 --> 02:58:24.360]  gonna test it out first so Kaiser don't don't try to count coup on me my ego
[02:58:24.360 --> 02:58:31.360]  can't handle it all right hey stay there we're gonna do some overdrive you know
[02:58:31.360 --> 02:58:37.320]  this is gallows humor actually that was my next question for kai zeta and that
[02:58:37.320 --> 02:58:41.040]  is we're gonna get into the whole internet kill switch and the metered
[02:58:41.040 --> 02:58:48.600]  internet stay with us this is GCN the Genesis communications radio
[02:58:48.600 --> 02:58:54.600]  network this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[02:58:54.600 --> 02:58:58.960]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[02:58:58.960 --> 02:59:03.120]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[02:59:03.120 --> 02:59:07.180]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[02:59:07.180 --> 02:59:11.040]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[02:59:11.040 --> 02:59:15.160]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[02:59:15.160 --> 02:59:19.500]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[02:59:19.500 --> 02:59:23.800]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[02:59:23.800 --> 02:59:27.520]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[02:59:27.520 --> 02:59:31.720]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[02:59:31.720 --> 02:59:35.080]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution
[02:59:35.080 --> 02:59:41.280]  from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[02:59:41.280 --> 02:59:45.920]  that's my solar backup.com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to

[02:59:51.720 --> 02:59:57.840]  coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones
[02:59:57.840 --> 03:00:14.000]  Broadcasting Network we are live this is the GCN radio network GCN live.com or you can
[03:00:14.000 --> 03:00:19.240]  hear Max Kaiser Saturday mornings with a syndicated radio transmission and here
[03:00:19.240 --> 03:00:25.360]  it is out of politics daily you can't make stuff up like this when President
[03:00:25.360 --> 03:00:32.200]  Obama appointed Utah's popular Republican governor John Huntsman to be the
[03:00:32.200 --> 03:00:36.520]  ambassador to China in May 2009 it looked like a smart move to show Obama's
[03:00:36.520 --> 03:00:42.320]  willingness to reach across party lines and be more cynical a way to sideline a
[03:00:42.320 --> 03:00:47.840]  possible opponent 2012 but that second calculation if it was Obama's mind may
[03:00:47.840 --> 03:00:52.440]  prove wrong several news organizations including Politico and ABC News are
[03:00:52.440 --> 03:00:57.120]  reporting that Huntsman may quit the China job this spring to prepare for a
[03:00:57.120 --> 03:01:02.920]  presidential run that he will make his decision by summer and I saw another
[03:01:02.920 --> 03:01:07.200]  report today where the Chinese said any companies they work with must do joint
[03:01:07.200 --> 03:01:11.840]  ventures with other Chinese companies of their choice and build factories and give
[03:01:11.840 --> 03:01:17.200]  all their technology to the Communist Chinese and I did see some points
[03:01:17.200 --> 03:01:21.240]  actually made by Donald Trump I'm not a big fan of usually about how it's all a
[03:01:21.240 --> 03:01:25.160]  one-way street with China with them keeping their currency low all of it
[03:01:25.160 --> 03:01:29.400]  but because America doesn't have a government we're just an open door like
[03:01:29.400 --> 03:01:34.360]  a whorehouse for the foreign banking cartels we are at a disadvantage and so
[03:01:34.360 --> 03:01:39.920]  we're going to Hades and a help in a hellbasket Hades in a handbasket I want
[03:01:39.920 --> 03:01:42.920]  to come back and go to calls because I know you're holding and but I want
[03:01:42.920 --> 03:01:49.360]  everybody to hear your calls but getting into this situation here Max Kaiser it
[03:01:49.360 --> 03:01:54.240]  just gets crazier and crazier as Egypt goes offline US gets internet kill
[03:01:54.240 --> 03:01:59.160]  switch bill ready they're they're now a pushing authoritarianism as if it's
[03:01:59.160 --> 03:02:04.080]  mother's milk and yes they're moving towards the metered tracked internet
[03:02:04.080 --> 03:02:10.920]  IDD new internet that's a piece of junk and they're really trying it because of
[03:02:10.920 --> 03:02:15.280]  this perfect storm of old dinosaur media and mainstream media Max Kaiser
[03:02:15.280 --> 03:02:20.400]  what's your take on this and how do we stop it well before you leave the China
[03:02:20.400 --> 03:02:24.580]  story there just a quick note you know when the hushentown was in Washington
[03:02:24.580 --> 03:02:32.480]  interesting alignment of facts you had I think was added bowling or Lockheed was
[03:02:32.480 --> 03:02:38.520]  given a multi tens of billions of dollars of business from a Chinese China
[03:02:38.520 --> 03:02:45.000]  while simultaneously announcing they were firing 10,000 Americans so you know
[03:02:45.000 --> 03:02:49.960]  the karmic poetry of this is beautiful they have these businessmen in the US
[03:02:49.960 --> 03:02:54.200]  literally kowtowing in front of the Chinese Premier you know for billions
[03:02:54.200 --> 03:03:00.040]  of dollars of the deals but at the same time they're firing Americans so you
[03:03:00.040 --> 03:03:05.600]  know this is an interesting time in history and the China of course is
[03:03:05.600 --> 03:03:10.680]  looking to somehow anyway let's go back what was the second question okay the
[03:03:10.680 --> 03:03:15.520]  internet kill switch you know the internet kill switch we see it happening
[03:03:15.520 --> 03:03:20.200]  in Cairo right they flick the switch they shut down social media you have this
[03:03:20.200 --> 03:03:23.100]  to clearly obliterate the point of the internet to begin with you know the
[03:03:23.100 --> 03:03:26.160]  internet is supposed to be point-to-point open-ended it's you know the
[03:03:26.160 --> 03:03:30.560]  point of the internet under the DARPA design was that you couldn't take it
[03:03:30.560 --> 03:03:34.440]  down you couldn't kill it there's a thousand and hundreds of thousands of
[03:03:34.440 --> 03:03:38.200]  points instead under this you can only visit a handful of sites like Facebook
[03:03:38.200 --> 03:03:42.800]  they admit that's the model right now well in the initial thing and the
[03:03:42.800 --> 03:03:47.080]  reason why there is a Facebook is because any fricking 22-year-old college
[03:03:47.080 --> 03:03:52.560]  Harvard guy could create a domain site and go to the world and get thousands
[03:03:52.560 --> 03:03:56.320]  of users and create a company but that will kill that that's another reason why
[03:03:56.320 --> 03:04:00.240]  Facebook is overvalued it's 50 billion dollars is because they're killing the
[03:04:00.240 --> 03:04:04.240]  golden goose deer if you if you strip the entrepreneur out of the internet if
[03:04:04.240 --> 03:04:08.040]  you make it impossible for people to reach the world for free which was what
[03:04:08.040 --> 03:04:13.000]  made the internet this multi billion trillion global phenomenon you're
[03:04:13.000 --> 03:04:17.880]  killing it you're killing you're killing the golden goose so why because those
[03:04:17.880 --> 03:04:22.200]  people like Comcast and the major media companies they want to squeeze just get
[03:04:22.200 --> 03:04:26.080]  another few pennies from the consumer and they don't care if the consumer has
[03:04:26.080 --> 03:04:30.000]  to go into debt and that brings us back to the casino gulag so the people on
[03:04:30.000 --> 03:04:33.760]  these sites like Facebook not only are they going to spend all their money on
[03:04:33.760 --> 03:04:38.020]  virtual currencies getting avatars and other game pieces to show off to their
[03:04:38.020 --> 03:04:42.480]  friends in a meaningless way but they're gonna go into virtual debt this is a
[03:04:42.480 --> 03:04:45.960]  subject that's not and it's not been talked about in other words the same way
[03:04:45.960 --> 03:04:49.680]  people go into debt today with mortgages they can't afford or car payment they
[03:04:49.680 --> 03:04:53.280]  can't afford people online are gonna start going into virtual debt and the
[03:04:53.280 --> 03:04:57.240]  only way they can pay off their virtual debt is to stay online 24 hours a

[03:08:06.360 --> 03:08:08.960]  Jones
[03:08:16.600 --> 03:08:21.160]  all right we're back live doing a couple more segments with the one the only max
[03:08:21.160 --> 03:08:25.000]  guys are going directly to your calls but max got cut off by the break we're
[03:08:25.000 --> 03:08:31.240]  talking about the internet morphing away from a free open system that has been
[03:08:31.240 --> 03:08:36.720]  the only boon for our economy really in the last 15 years the only real growth
[03:08:36.720 --> 03:08:41.480]  sector driving everything and now the globalist going back over a decade of
[03:08:41.480 --> 03:08:45.360]  openly said they're gonna phase it into this internet to where you've only got a
[03:08:45.360 --> 03:08:50.280]  few thousand choices all of those are globalist subsidiaries if you have a
[03:08:50.280 --> 03:08:55.400]  domain it will be a sub domain of a Facebook or a CNN or a New York Times
[03:08:55.400 --> 03:09:01.600]  or a government site or a university and now what Kaiser talked about three
[03:09:01.600 --> 03:09:06.920]  years ago on the show Goldman Sachs Facebook where you quote make money
[03:09:06.920 --> 03:09:11.920]  clicking on ads all day but it's not enough money to live and meanwhile they
[03:09:11.920 --> 03:09:15.640]  know where you're at they're tracking you they know you're every move they know
[03:09:15.640 --> 03:09:21.120]  what you're doing they want to keep you on their internet platforms where you
[03:09:21.120 --> 03:09:25.480]  waive your rights when you're on Google or Facebook and now they can surveil you
[03:09:25.480 --> 03:09:29.880]  and they train people how cool it is to give all their private data up to these
[03:09:29.880 --> 03:09:34.360]  systems it's incredible is that what you're getting at max Kaiser that's one
[03:09:34.360 --> 03:09:38.320]  half of the story which is the Gulag story and the other half is the casino
[03:09:38.320 --> 03:09:43.360]  story so in order to keep people hooked of course they use all the tricks and the
[03:09:43.360 --> 03:09:48.400]  techniques of the casino so that people are are they win a little bit here and
[03:09:48.400 --> 03:09:52.560]  there to keep them hooked and all that all the behavioral economics and all
[03:09:52.560 --> 03:09:56.640]  the ways that they now knew through neuro economics to keep people hooked
[03:09:56.640 --> 03:10:02.800]  into into into this into this Gulag casino so at the end of the day you're
[03:10:02.800 --> 03:10:07.360]  there gambling your your entire life away to make enough money to get a
[03:10:07.360 --> 03:10:11.880]  cup of coffee and you and just like those cup a couple in Korea South Korea I
[03:10:11.880 --> 03:10:16.200]  don't know if you saw this story it was a few months ago they got so involved and
[03:10:16.200 --> 03:10:21.160]  raided in their virtual avatar baby online as part of a game that they
[03:10:21.160 --> 03:10:26.400]  neglected their real baby who starved to death yes I did say that let's let's I
[03:10:26.400 --> 03:10:30.640]  mean let's put the cherry on top on this and then go to calls people are being
[03:10:30.640 --> 03:10:35.600]  sucked into the internet it is becoming the literal matrix it's a fantasy
[03:10:35.600 --> 03:10:40.960]  world and people will go out and mug folks to have money to go into second
[03:10:40.960 --> 03:10:47.880]  life and all these other virtual systems to then have have status in the false
[03:10:47.880 --> 03:10:54.280]  reality and then as we neglect the real reality it allows the tyranny to come
[03:10:54.280 --> 03:10:58.360]  creeping in and just like Orwell talked about how big brother would use
[03:10:58.360 --> 03:11:04.360]  lotteries and and the proletariat could could could would have energy and
[03:11:04.360 --> 03:11:08.760]  intellect to have fake systems to win the lottery but couldn't wake up to
[03:11:08.760 --> 03:11:13.320]  government corruption this is the system of enslavement is this forced
[03:11:13.320 --> 03:11:18.440]  gambling society right just like for example a Wall Street bank like JP
[03:11:18.440 --> 03:11:23.560]  Morgan is the number one dealer in derivative products that end up in
[03:11:23.560 --> 03:11:27.720]  foreclosures and devastation in America guess who was also the number one
[03:11:27.720 --> 03:11:32.960]  dealer in food stamps in America they control the system a Goldman Sachs JP
[03:11:32.960 --> 03:11:37.560]  Morgan they they this day they make you homeless they put you on the food line
[03:11:37.560 --> 03:11:41.360]  and then they also make a business in the food stamp that's what JP Morgan is
[03:11:41.360 --> 03:11:44.640]  that Goldman Sachs has a plain Facebook because it's a new virtual Gulag
[03:11:44.640 --> 03:11:49.480]  casino to allow people being having their prices of food so high they can't
[03:11:49.480 --> 03:11:53.600]  afford it they eat they'll be online all day long trying to make enough virtual
[03:11:53.600 --> 03:11:56.400]  currency to convert it into dollars through their swipe card they'll be
[03:11:56.400 --> 03:11:59.760]  provided by them they go to you can already go to 7-eleven right now they
[03:11:59.760 --> 03:12:03.600]  have a deal with farm bill which is part of Facebook you can get actual food and
[03:12:03.600 --> 03:12:08.880]  exchange and you predicted all of this three years ago on this show Kaiser
[03:12:08.880 --> 03:12:13.120]  incredible here's some breaking news Florida judge rules health care law
[03:12:13.120 --> 03:12:17.840]  unconstitutional a federal judge as a second federal judge has ruled that
[03:12:17.840 --> 03:12:22.240]  health care reform bill signed the law last year by Barry Sataro known as
[03:12:22.240 --> 03:12:26.760]  Barack Obama in March was unconstitutional today's decision is a
[03:12:26.760 --> 03:12:31.000]  second ruling by a federal judge against the constitutionality of the health care
[03:12:31.000 --> 03:12:35.320]  legislation two other federal courts have upheld the constitutionality of the
[03:12:35.320 --> 03:12:39.400]  law including its requirement that most Americans buy health insurance or pay a
[03:12:39.400 --> 03:12:42.320]  penalty but then meanwhile if you get an imperial
[03:12:42.320 --> 03:12:47.840]  chit from Obama like McDonald's or others you don't have to get the health
[03:12:47.840 --> 03:12:52.680]  care but your competition does giving you an unfair trade advantage talk about
[03:12:52.680 --> 03:12:59.080]  a a stilted jilted table talk about the casino Gulag where that where the house
[03:12:59.080 --> 03:13:06.800]  always wins but you the suckers don't and bringing up the JP Morgan involved
[03:13:06.800 --> 03:13:11.520]  controlling the food stamps and having foreign operators in India answering the
[03:13:11.520 --> 03:13:15.440]  phones for the unemployment systems it reminds me of congressional studies
[03:13:15.440 --> 03:13:20.160]  that came out were big mega banks laundering hundreds of billions of
[03:13:20.160 --> 03:13:26.640]  dollars of drug money a year this is admitted also own the private prisons
[03:13:26.640 --> 03:13:31.520]  where they put you when you use the narcotics they ship in I mean they've
[03:13:31.520 --> 03:13:35.320]  got this whole thing actuaried out they've got this thing figured out Max
[03:13:35.320 --> 03:13:39.520]  Kaiser well that that's the casino industry they it's extremely you know
[03:13:39.520 --> 03:13:44.520]  calibrated and calculated to bring people in these those frequent player
[03:13:44.520 --> 03:13:48.760]  cards at a casino they know your emotional psychographic they steer you in
[03:13:48.760 --> 03:13:53.480]  ways that you have fallibility in your psyche so they give up more most of your
[03:13:53.480 --> 03:13:58.480]  money to two of the biggest things fallacies I hear from the what's
[03:13:58.480 --> 03:14:03.840]  called the liberal press are two things number one that Barack Obama that
[03:14:03.840 --> 03:14:08.240]  created some kind of new health care that's beneficial for people that's
[03:14:08.240 --> 03:14:13.760]  false plus the banks are paying back the money they were given by the government
[03:14:13.760 --> 03:14:18.520]  that is also false when I tune into people like for example Ilmar he has a
[03:14:18.520 --> 03:14:24.200]  show on HBO called real time every week he says well Obama's health care and or
[03:14:24.200 --> 03:14:27.960]  the bank bailouts we're getting our money back well both of those things are
[03:14:27.960 --> 03:14:32.000]  patently fall there in which it's frustrating because there's nobody in
[03:14:32.000 --> 03:14:37.040]  mainstream media or even let's say CNBC's Rachel Maddow who's a kind of a
[03:14:37.040 --> 03:14:43.560]  more on that left space mr. Maddow it was willing to admit that health care
[03:14:43.560 --> 03:14:48.880]  was a big huge wet kiss to the insurance and pharmaceutical company well they
[03:14:48.880 --> 03:14:53.280]  publicly wrote it and I would tell moron liberals that that they're not even
[03:14:53.280 --> 03:14:59.280]  liberals they're just tuning into a fake corporate transmission of who they are
[03:14:59.280 --> 03:15:04.360]  and then defending this false reality 30 million people are gonna have to go
[03:15:04.360 --> 03:15:08.360]  into debt on behalf of the pharmaceutical and insurance company that's what
[03:15:08.360 --> 03:15:12.440]  that bill and it allows them to take over and and cut doctors out of the
[03:15:12.440 --> 03:15:16.640]  equation of deciding what health care you get and that's what the liberals
[03:15:16.640 --> 03:15:21.400]  want that's their eugenics let's go it just look at the plain facts on these
[03:15:21.400 --> 03:15:24.240]  cases the bank bailouts for example you hear all the time we're getting paid
[03:15:24.240 --> 03:15:28.480]  back for the bailout money which is again it's completely false all you have
[03:15:28.480 --> 03:15:31.800]  to do is look at that debt ceiling number if in fact there was anyone getting
[03:15:31.800 --> 03:15:35.200]  paid back for anything would they be raising the debt ceiling again by another
[03:15:35.200 --> 03:15:39.280]  one trillion dollars and that's gonna end up being raised several times over
[03:15:39.280 --> 03:15:43.200]  the next year and it's absolutely ludicrous to think that any money is
[03:15:43.200 --> 03:15:47.120]  being paid back to anybody for these bailouts in fact they're just siphoning
[03:15:47.120 --> 03:15:51.360]  up more cash on a daily basis and just make so where does it in because I got
[03:15:51.360 --> 03:15:55.080]  to go to phone calls people are holding patiently I'm gonna skip this break you
[03:15:55.080 --> 03:15:58.880]  know we're gonna take these calls but where does it end I mean do people wake
[03:15:58.880 --> 03:16:03.400]  up out of the matrix trance while they're playing you know games like
[03:16:03.400 --> 03:16:09.520]  Angry Birds all day do people stop it or is it just over for us and the
[03:16:09.520 --> 03:16:13.560]  globalist figured out mind control they figured out you know a beautiful
[03:16:13.560 --> 03:16:19.400]  kaleidoscope to suck us into this and that's it humanities over
[03:16:19.400 --> 03:16:25.600]  we're seeing it over in other countries they are reacting to this issue and it
[03:16:25.600 --> 03:16:29.280]  just the US is going to be one of the last countries to react because of that
[03:16:29.280 --> 03:16:34.040]  dollar reserve status and the fact that even now the relative cost of food and
[03:16:34.040 --> 03:16:38.240]  energy for most Americans that they're cheap relative to the rest of the world
[03:16:38.240 --> 03:16:43.280]  and it that's why America is gonna act blast and that's why the system is
[03:16:43.280 --> 03:16:47.280]  gearing up all this paramilitary force to suppress us because they can't
[03:16:47.280 --> 03:16:50.640]  believe what they've already gotten away with and so they're getting the cops
[03:16:50.640 --> 03:16:55.520]  ready the machine guns the weapons the camps because they know that if the US
[03:16:55.520 --> 03:17:00.280]  ever gets taken back by the American people their party is over let's talk
[03:17:00.280 --> 03:17:05.080]  to Tony in Seattle thanks for holding her on the air with Max Kaiser yes Max
[03:17:05.080 --> 03:17:09.160]  good to hear from you thank you mr. Jones again we've been having some basic
[03:17:09.160 --> 03:17:14.720]  let's say informative meetings on my side and the question that keeps coming
[03:17:14.720 --> 03:17:19.080]  up consistently is we're trying to inform those are the secret meetings of
[03:17:19.080 --> 03:17:24.080]  the federal people Bohemian Grove meetings bank fraud people taking copious
[03:17:24.080 --> 03:17:31.680]  you know yes well they're ruining us okay this is what the people are trying
[03:17:31.680 --> 03:17:36.440]  to ask me how do we prosecute how do we hold them accountable why aren't they
[03:17:36.440 --> 03:17:42.920]  is this an AG scenario a judge issue is this a class act lawsuits now how do we
[03:17:42.920 --> 03:17:47.840]  finally hold these people accountable lawsuits are exposing the lawsuits are
[03:17:47.840 --> 03:17:53.400]  exposing the fraud of them foreclosing on houses that are paid for our houses
[03:17:53.400 --> 03:17:57.240]  they don't have paperwork on our houses they don't really own I think running
[03:17:57.240 --> 03:18:02.560]  for office suing boycotting globalist companies supporting local economies
[03:18:02.560 --> 03:18:08.640]  Max Kaiser what are a gamut of solutions well as the point as the
[03:18:08.640 --> 03:18:12.520]  caller points out and as we've been talking about when they get caught they
[03:18:12.520 --> 03:18:16.640]  simply changed the law you remember part of the foreclosure crisis with the I
[03:18:16.640 --> 03:18:20.040]  think it was golden or Bank of America was caught violating interstate notary
[03:18:20.040 --> 03:18:26.120]  law and they simply passed the new law to change the law so my solution gets
[03:18:26.120 --> 03:18:30.240]  back to the fact that the banks are holding hundreds of billions of our
[03:18:30.240 --> 03:18:35.760]  money that they refuse to act in a responsible way the only way to get our
[03:18:35.760 --> 03:18:39.480]  money back and we've talked about on your show before is that buy silver
[03:18:39.480 --> 03:18:44.840]  campaign which you buy an ounce of silver and physical you you destroy 100
[03:18:44.840 --> 03:18:49.680]  ounces of paper on the balance sheet of these banks in particular JP Morgan so
[03:18:49.680 --> 03:18:53.600]  in other words it's a global movement to take physical off the market and to
[03:18:53.600 --> 03:18:58.000]  just put these banks out of business because other there's no law that will
[03:18:58.000 --> 03:19:02.400]  be passed to address the problem there's no government officials who's down the
[03:19:02.400 --> 03:19:07.920]  pocket of the bank the only thing that can be work is if we rebalance the
[03:19:07.920 --> 03:19:12.160]  market itself and the only way we can do that with the resources we have is by
[03:19:12.160 --> 03:19:15.760]  each of us putting up a few bucks take a physical ounce off the market it's
[03:19:15.760 --> 03:19:20.000]  less than 30 billion dollars the entire global silver market is less than 30
[03:19:20.000 --> 03:19:24.320]  billion dollars yeah max we got to move on but if you look at the silver and
[03:19:24.320 --> 03:19:27.880]  gold graph the last 10 years it's going straight up they can always manipulate
[03:19:27.880 --> 03:19:33.320]  it down for a season but then it bounds up even more after that and we see that
[03:19:33.320 --> 03:19:37.080]  rebound already happening again and they've reported in the last two months
[03:19:37.080 --> 03:19:44.120]  since we launched this operation here with max's spurring that it's record
[03:19:44.120 --> 03:19:49.400]  physical purchases going on and that separation between paper and reality is
[03:19:49.400 --> 03:19:52.560]  becoming more and more clear it's happening in the energy market too
[03:19:52.560 --> 03:19:56.320]  out you know that the paper price for oil is ten dollars cheaper than the
[03:19:56.320 --> 03:20:00.360]  physical price yes so and this is happening in these markets all over
[03:20:00.360 --> 03:20:03.520]  the world and they're becoming completely detached from reality which is
[03:20:03.520 --> 03:20:07.320]  leading to incredible instability which means that there's an incredible bank
[03:20:07.320 --> 03:20:11.240]  crash coming and this is what they'll say they'll come to us and they'll say
[03:20:11.240 --> 03:20:15.720]  because the banks have crashed really this time that what happened in 2008 was
[03:20:15.720 --> 03:20:19.720]  nothing they really are crashing we need to roll up all these currencies into a
[03:20:19.720 --> 03:20:23.960]  $100 trillion new lending facility in a global bank and they'll threaten to
[03:20:23.960 --> 03:20:28.120]  destroy everyone's lives unless we agree to that and my point is we got to get the
[03:20:28.120 --> 03:20:32.040]  jump yeah at that point we educate everybody and we a call for their arrest
[03:20:32.040 --> 03:20:36.800]  for the financial terrorism and say that's enough scammers it's over then we
[03:20:36.800 --> 03:20:40.640]  go with the Ron Paul model let's go ahead and talk to Mike in Illinois got to
[03:20:40.640 --> 03:20:42.640]  move to these calls Michael on the air
[03:20:42.640 --> 03:20:47.920]  good afternoon mr. Jones good evening mr. Kaiser I'd like to paint the
[03:20:47.920 --> 03:20:52.280]  Egyptian issue in a totally different light if the United States has been the
[03:20:52.280 --> 03:20:57.000]  industrialized and it's been handed over to China China truly benefits from
[03:20:57.000 --> 03:21:01.440]  control of things like the Suez canal and the Panama Canal if the United States
[03:21:01.440 --> 03:21:05.400]  is going into decline and we're going to have to pull out of that region that
[03:21:05.400 --> 03:21:11.120]  power void will be filled at least in this projection by a Chinese presence now
[03:21:11.120 --> 03:21:16.880]  they benefit the most from all of this they have access to European markets you
[03:21:16.880 --> 03:21:21.040]  know it has incredible interest inside our government our government doesn't
[03:21:21.040 --> 03:21:25.600]  exist anymore as I said it's a whorehouse where you put coins in and get
[03:21:25.600 --> 03:21:30.640]  enslaved Americans back so I agree that there may be some Chinese interest in
[03:21:30.640 --> 03:21:36.400]  here that's an interesting point go ahead
[03:21:36.400 --> 03:21:43.800]  haven't met Kaiser oh yeah okay so yeah I agree I mean Chinese have incredible
[03:21:43.800 --> 03:21:49.480]  influence there they've got the cash and they will be very active in and they've
[03:21:49.480 --> 03:21:53.040]  got the cash to do with the US as you point out the industrialized big banking
[03:21:53.040 --> 03:21:57.280]  problems and no and you know the popularity of America in Egypt is less
[03:21:57.280 --> 03:22:02.320]  than 17% it's one of the least popular countries in the world in Egypt and
[03:22:02.320 --> 03:22:06.400]  again that's unpopularity with the ruling regime and the political
[03:22:06.400 --> 03:22:11.320]  whore class just like Congress has a 9 to 11% here that doesn't mean America
[03:22:11.320 --> 03:22:15.760]  hates America these people aren't America these are hijacking Bernie made
[03:22:15.760 --> 03:22:21.640]  off Ken lay types arrest them get them out of here end it now death to the new
[03:22:21.640 --> 03:22:26.640]  world order give me my republic anything else Mike yeah if if you were
[03:22:26.640 --> 03:22:30.360]  actually going to perform a Machiavellian exchange of leadership and take the
[03:22:30.360 --> 03:22:34.040]  United States out of the top top dog position you would really be seeing
[03:22:34.040 --> 03:22:37.160]  what's going on in the world right now I think in the future you're going to see
[03:22:37.160 --> 03:22:40.000]  nationalization of production and they'll just tell the American companies
[03:22:40.000 --> 03:22:43.320]  too bad they've already got the production facilities we already set them
[03:22:43.320 --> 03:22:46.720]  up with the equipment we gave them the designs I mean they've literally they
[03:22:46.720 --> 03:22:51.200]  splayed us out in front of the Chinese and are asking them to just crush us so
[03:22:51.200 --> 03:22:54.640]  as we move forward and we see all these new things developed throughout the
[03:22:54.640 --> 03:22:58.720]  world you have to you can't apply the old model Egypt has been an ally they've
[03:22:58.720 --> 03:23:02.840]  provided us unfettered access to the Persian Gulf for decades to perform
[03:23:02.840 --> 03:23:07.000]  military operation I mean it's all of these things happen you have to look
[03:23:07.000 --> 03:23:10.960]  at it I agree with you but I wouldn't say China that's what I've been saying the
[03:23:10.960 --> 03:23:15.000]  last two three days on this it's globalist if we think about it as terms of
[03:23:15.000 --> 03:23:21.280]  America China we get it wrong China is the new darling apprentice of the New
[03:23:21.280 --> 03:23:25.760]  World Order because it sterilizes people and up force of boards in the
[03:23:25.760 --> 03:23:30.760]  globalist that's a sacrament to them and and and they they would do select
[03:23:30.760 --> 03:23:34.840]  business deals were only served certain globalists could gain access then they
[03:23:34.840 --> 03:23:39.560]  could leverage out their competition worldwide but I agree this is a globalist
[03:23:39.560 --> 03:23:46.400]  move to undercut Egypt to create global crisis which will empower the globalist
[03:23:46.400 --> 03:23:52.360]  interest not America and it is done as an entree towards the new baby Satan
[03:23:52.360 --> 03:23:58.720]  China Max Kaiser well a couple points number one this event of past two to
[03:23:58.720 --> 03:24:03.720]  three weeks are making Al Jazeera an incredibly important global network it's
[03:24:03.720 --> 03:24:07.920]  been shut out of America since it launched ten years ago and I think that
[03:24:07.920 --> 03:24:11.840]  as a result that many people are demanding Al Jazeera English in America
[03:24:11.840 --> 03:24:16.000]  and it's a fantastic network I've made many films for that number two you know
[03:24:16.000 --> 03:24:22.160]  during this whole uprising Tarpley says their British intelligence run well
[03:24:22.160 --> 03:24:28.840]  give people a choice between CNN NBC CNBC Al Jazeera English check it out you
[03:24:28.840 --> 03:24:32.040]  know view it see what you think about it you know don't condemn it before you
[03:24:32.040 --> 03:24:37.280]  investigate it the second thing is we've been talking about Egypt Egypt Egypt
[03:24:37.280 --> 03:24:42.960]  you never hear the word Muslim or Islam is long because this is a movement of the
[03:24:42.960 --> 03:24:48.120]  people well yeah I mean it's not Muslims in you know that are revolting in
[03:24:48.120 --> 03:24:51.680]  Ireland or in Greece either but it caught everybody off guard you know
[03:24:51.680 --> 03:24:55.140]  because the narrative in all these countries the way the US keeps their
[03:24:55.140 --> 03:24:59.000]  thumb on a country like Egypt of course is to talk about them in terms of them
[03:24:59.000 --> 03:25:04.040]  being Islam and of course in America Islam equals terrorist fanatic and you
[03:25:04.040 --> 03:25:07.480]  don't hear that because this is not what's going on here yeah we're actually
[03:25:07.480 --> 03:25:10.680]  seeing Middle Easterners or North Africans that aren't being called the
[03:25:10.680 --> 03:25:15.400]  Elsie Bob thank you Mike let's talk to what is a huge change in the in the war
[03:25:15.400 --> 03:25:20.960]  the information war because the folks that want to control things like to
[03:25:20.960 --> 03:25:24.920]  position them in very negative terms but this is not the case here you never
[03:25:24.920 --> 03:25:30.160]  hear let's jam in a few final calls max we we got to get to these Daniel and
[03:25:30.160 --> 03:25:32.000]  Illinois you're on the air
[03:25:32.000 --> 03:25:39.440]  Hey what's up Alex I came across some T info I got an application video for the

[03:25:55.360 --> 03:25:58.840]  people act like they're really the Illuminati but but but we'll look it up
[03:25:58.840 --> 03:26:02.960]  right now thank you Daniel let's talk to Brian in Connecticut Brian you're on
[03:26:02.960 --> 03:26:09.420]  the air hey hey Alex max is Brian I'm driving so I'll uh I'll try to keep
[03:26:09.420 --> 03:26:14.480]  this brief first of all I'm a first-time caller I've been listening to you Alex
[03:26:14.480 --> 03:26:19.120]  for years I was a money bomb supporter and I just I just want to send you guys
[03:26:19.120 --> 03:26:28.040]  a lot of love and appreciation for helping to share a real you know a real
[03:26:28.040 --> 03:26:32.080]  open-hearted American perspective on life in common sense it's just it's so
[03:26:32.080 --> 03:26:36.440]  refreshing you know I grew up in Connecticut here and you're just kind
[03:26:36.440 --> 03:26:44.080]  of indoctrinated with the the standard vaccine-based information system you know
[03:26:44.080 --> 03:26:47.200]  and it just it's so refreshing I just really wanted to thank you let me say
[03:26:47.200 --> 03:26:50.840]  you all the love from here we couldn't do it without you the listeners who spread
[03:26:50.840 --> 03:26:55.680]  the word and support us so I want to thank you we're almost out of time do
[03:26:55.680 --> 03:27:00.260]  you have any questions or comments from Max Kaisers yes sir I'll keep this
[03:27:00.260 --> 03:27:04.120]  super brief then yeah I just wanted to hear you guys perspective on something I
[03:27:04.120 --> 03:27:12.320]  I thought of just a very very simple common sense thing that people can do to
[03:27:12.320 --> 03:27:18.000]  help kind of like restore some sense of of common sense and integrity in people's
[03:27:18.000 --> 03:27:23.440]  own minds I think that that sure what's the idea of positive yeah um and uh
[03:27:23.440 --> 03:27:31.800]  basically if an average healthy person gets what people call the flu I think
[03:27:31.800 --> 03:27:35.640]  that people should be thankful for that because if you if you use some common
[03:27:35.640 --> 03:27:39.640]  sense according to some doctors like Russell Blalock and folks like that
[03:27:39.640 --> 03:27:43.200]  that I've listened to they're kind of advocating that you know when you get a
[03:27:43.200 --> 03:27:48.120]  fever and you get these aches and chills it's basically your body just kind of
[03:27:48.120 --> 03:27:52.380]  you know like purging some stuff that I need to let go of and the aches and the
[03:27:52.380 --> 03:27:55.040]  bones and the joints are also like the bones and the joints kind of purging
[03:27:55.040 --> 03:27:59.440]  some things yeah they don't want you to learn your body to learn how to protect
[03:27:59.440 --> 03:28:04.920]  itself I guess that's the question for Max Kaiser I appreciate that call this
[03:28:04.920 --> 03:28:09.440]  whole casino gulag economy it's the same thing with big pharma Max and people
[03:28:09.440 --> 03:28:14.000]  are waking up to that yes not the flu is the plague and then we got the plague
[03:28:14.000 --> 03:28:17.640]  here we got the financial plague we've got the banker plague and it's
[03:28:17.640 --> 03:28:23.360]  decimating entire population and the US which is a media capital the world in
[03:28:23.360 --> 03:28:28.360]  many respects is going to hit their last so that's the that's really irony of
[03:28:28.360 --> 03:28:31.280]  all this whole thing and so makes it so hard to get the message through to
[03:28:31.280 --> 03:28:35.860]  Americans is because they're going to be the last on the list because they've
[03:28:35.860 --> 03:28:41.200]  got that cushion of a reserve currency but the people in Egypt and around the
[03:28:41.200 --> 03:28:44.560]  world don't have that cushion they're feeling the effects of all that money
[03:28:44.560 --> 03:28:48.680]  printing right now and they're now facing starvation and they're revolting
[03:28:48.680 --> 03:28:52.800]  and they're trying to do it peacefully despite the provocateurs despite the
[03:28:52.800 --> 03:28:56.800]  machinations of the US government all they wanted a fair deal all they want to
[03:28:56.800 --> 03:29:01.080]  do is compete fairly Max we're almost out of time in closing you premiered
[03:29:01.080 --> 03:29:06.120]  that video here and we're appreciative of that of know me friends the former
[03:29:06.120 --> 03:29:09.880]  managing director at Goldman Sachs coming out against Goldman Sachs and
[03:29:09.880 --> 03:29:14.200]  basically saying insider trading why is she now getting so hardcore and speaking
[03:29:14.200 --> 03:29:19.920]  out I think that she is somebody and you find this in the finance business a lot
[03:29:19.920 --> 03:29:25.960]  if people they come into finance I am the same with a real healthy respect for
[03:29:25.960 --> 03:29:30.200]  this idea of free market capitalism and when you see it being abused as you do
[03:29:30.200 --> 03:29:34.320]  like Goldman Sachs by the bank you become outraged and you have to get that
[03:29:34.320 --> 03:29:37.720]  message out there she's one of us Alex he's a good one all right max let me say
[03:29:37.720 --> 03:29:41.320]  bye to you during this break retransmission coming up here in just a
