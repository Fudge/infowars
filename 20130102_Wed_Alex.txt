[00:00.000 --> 00:11.880]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[00:11.880 --> 00:19.540]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[00:19.540 --> 00:34.160]  Alex Jones
[00:34.160 --> 00:41.440]  well 2013 is already getting a little long in the tooth here it is the second
[00:41.440 --> 00:48.720]  day of January 2012 and we are live ladies and gentlemen on this Wednesday
[00:48.720 --> 00:55.320]  edition and we will have open phones yet again today here in the new year after I
[00:55.320 --> 01:02.040]  cover the news obviously you do know the news don't you
[01:02.040 --> 01:12.000]  $1 in government cuts for every $41 in taxes increased we're gonna explain why
[01:12.000 --> 01:17.880]  that is see once they get you in debt you pay almost all your taxes to foreign
[01:17.880 --> 01:23.440]  banks on interest and then the whole infrastructure implodes and that's by
[01:23.440 --> 01:28.560]  design and then after the infrastructure implodes they come in and buy everything
[01:28.560 --> 01:32.080]  up with your money for pennies on the dollar and people are too ignorant and
[01:32.080 --> 01:35.560]  too dumb running around drinking fluoride water and talking about Obama
[01:35.560 --> 01:41.120]  phones to be able to even able to understand exactly what's happening to
[01:41.120 --> 01:50.680]  them so $1 in cuts for every 41 in taxes deal means higher taxes on 77% of
[01:50.680 --> 01:57.960]  households in the country I thought it was on the evil greedy 2% the 2% that
[01:57.960 --> 02:01.760]  means the 2% that are making a couple hundred thousand a year not the
[02:01.760 --> 02:05.480]  billionaires that control trillions offshore they're the ones that wrote all
[02:05.480 --> 02:09.000]  this they're the ones that took the country over but the Obama phone lady
[02:09.000 --> 02:13.120]  she had never gonna figure that out that's why she's poor that's why she's
[02:13.120 --> 02:17.360]  you know down and out because she believes in the system congressional
[02:17.360 --> 02:24.520]  budget office adds 3.9 trillion more to deficit and Paul Ryan votes yes
[02:24.520 --> 02:31.960]  Cantor no is Boehner finishes speaker of the GOP torn in half
[02:31.960 --> 02:36.400]  you know that's why the collectivists are so happy they go the GOP is over
[02:36.400 --> 02:40.120]  it'll implode where if you know some western and southern states will be
[02:40.120 --> 02:46.000]  conservative like Arizona and Texas and but the rest of its ours we've got
[02:46.000 --> 02:48.800]  people dependent they actually brag about it you see them in the news and
[02:48.800 --> 02:53.960]  yeah because the globalist have bought off the Republican leadership
[02:53.960 --> 02:59.640]  they've totally absolutely bought them off and that's why you're going to see
[02:59.640 --> 03:04.440]  the Congress pass total open borders totally legal alien legalization free
[03:04.440 --> 03:07.440]  health care form everything else citizens won't get it it's already that
[03:07.440 --> 03:11.480]  way that's why you're gonna see the gun ban physically and make you turn them in
[03:11.480 --> 03:16.000]  and they want to have a war with you they've gone to Congress and said we're
[03:16.000 --> 03:19.600]  dropping the hammer you lined up you like your insider trading money you like
[03:19.600 --> 03:23.920]  your hookers good we got photos with you with all of them we're bringing America
[03:23.920 --> 03:28.360]  down you don't do what you're told you're dead
[03:28.360 --> 03:34.680]  this is a foreign banking takeover our military is now under their control
[03:34.680 --> 03:40.000]  we're now under NATO UN Bilderberg control now it's so outrageous that if
[03:40.000 --> 03:44.560]  we speak out against it at the grassroots they won't get away with it
[03:44.560 --> 03:49.080]  but they're committed they're imploding things now so they've got to totally
[03:49.080 --> 03:54.280]  take over and pose as saviors as we kind of bounce down the cliff into oblivion
[03:54.280 --> 03:59.760]  and the foreign banks of course the control the fraudulent stock market with
[03:59.760 --> 04:04.080]  all their high-frequency trading and all their put options and scams and plunge
[04:04.080 --> 04:08.760]  protection team they boosted the stock market hundreds of points the Dow Jones
[04:08.760 --> 04:16.200]  Industrial so everyone goes oh good increasing taxes is good for an economy
[04:16.200 --> 04:22.280]  it's like going into somebody who's dying of cancer or something and
[04:22.280 --> 04:26.240]  they've got family flying into town to see him before they die and the person's
[04:26.240 --> 04:30.120]  having trouble breathing and they'll ask them they say you know you'll be dead in
[04:30.120 --> 04:33.480]  about an hour we don't give you a bunch of adrenaline and drugs you want these
[04:33.480 --> 04:37.160]  drugs actually been there when this was happening to somebody they were at an
[04:37.160 --> 04:41.560]  organ failure and the family's like yeah shoot him up and they just kept pumping
[04:41.560 --> 04:45.600]  pumping adrenaline and drugs into him and the guy's dad got there got to see
[04:45.600 --> 04:48.880]  him and then they got passed out and died they said he'll be dead in a few
[04:48.880 --> 04:53.200]  minutes is his veins of all clothes we can't even inject him anymore so the
[04:53.200 --> 05:00.000]  bankers will do that up stay with us we'll be right back

[09:05.600 --> 09:11.720]  be here live for the next three hours former congressional fraud investigator
[09:11.720 --> 09:18.760]  Bob Fletcher who was a Iran contra whistleblower and more will be joining
[09:18.760 --> 09:23.960]  us to talk about the mafia nature and the complete criminal takeover of our
[09:23.960 --> 09:28.920]  government in the third hour we will have open phones in the first and second
[09:28.920 --> 09:34.640]  hour and third hour today you know I hate to say see I told you so but we
[09:34.640 --> 09:37.600]  talked about this months ago Ron Paul has talked about it here on the
[09:37.600 --> 09:42.440]  broadcast a month ago or so by the way it's time to get Ron Paul back onto the
[09:42.440 --> 09:47.640]  crew he said he wanted to come back on in the new year we've all been on record
[09:47.640 --> 09:54.440]  because they even in Brazil and in other countries in Japan in Europe three or
[09:54.440 --> 09:58.520]  four times the last few years depending on the country with the EU over them
[09:58.520 --> 10:03.280]  they have said fiscal cliff we're going to collapse if we don't increase taxes
[10:03.280 --> 10:11.600]  this is how they got the taxes up to 80% on average in France and then 75% on top
[10:11.600 --> 10:19.640]  of the money you keep if you're the quote top 2% so the top 2% would be
[10:19.640 --> 10:25.000]  paying over 90% in taxes
[10:25.000 --> 10:30.120]  okay they had a bunch of actors and people who are really the nouveau riche
[10:30.120 --> 10:34.240]  the new rich who were leaving so now France is backing off and saying okay
[10:34.240 --> 10:39.560]  it'll only be a 50% tax on everybody who makes more than a million euros a year
[10:39.560 --> 10:45.680]  so you pay all these taxes and then if you keep a million over that
[10:45.680 --> 10:52.080]  you make ten million dollars you keep two million you make ten million euros
[10:52.080 --> 10:55.480]  you keep two million and they go well that's over a million we're gonna get
[10:55.480 --> 11:02.480]  75% of that so you'd have to make ten million dollars to make half a million I
[11:02.480 --> 11:07.960]  mean does that really quote sound fair to all of you that love big government
[11:07.960 --> 11:11.760]  and do you know that people that make that type of money are the folks that
[11:11.760 --> 11:15.680]  actually buy services and are the heart of the economy but see if you're a
[11:15.680 --> 11:20.520]  Rothschild or a Rockefeller or a Queen of England they're all in giant tax-free
[11:20.520 --> 11:24.880]  foundations grandfather that nobody else is allowed to set up you can't set up a
[11:24.880 --> 11:29.280]  family partnership like Rockefeller Brothers Foundation and pay zero tax
[11:29.280 --> 11:34.360]  they are allowed to and Bill Gates was allowed to and Warren Buffett was
[11:34.360 --> 11:39.320]  allowed to they've been doing this since 1906 with the Sherman Antitrust Act with
[11:39.320 --> 11:44.640]  Teddy Roosevelt that they sold as a way to soak the robber barons who were a
[11:44.640 --> 11:50.040]  bunch of exempt from the law private armies of Pinkerton out murdering people
[11:50.040 --> 11:55.440]  in mass I mean they wanted your property from the 1850s on they just had you know
[11:55.440 --> 12:00.280]  a trainload of armed troops show up private troops they come kill you that's
[12:00.280 --> 12:04.760]  on record so people started getting together and
[12:04.760 --> 12:08.960]  the the Rockefellers on record had a bunch of their people wiped out
[12:08.960 --> 12:13.960]  repeatedly when towns would get together when Pinkerton and others would go
[12:13.960 --> 12:17.480]  slaughter people the towns would get together with their guns and go after
[12:17.480 --> 12:22.400]  them so then in some cases they call the army in to back up the Rockefellers I
[12:22.400 --> 12:27.720]  mean our country has been through this over and over again the globalist the
[12:27.720 --> 12:33.360]  multinational corporations in Latin America and in Africa and in Burma in
[12:33.360 --> 12:38.280]  places you can go look up 4,000 killed in British takeover of Burma but back in
[12:38.280 --> 12:41.720]  like 98 I mean there's all these examples where they set up a UN
[12:41.720 --> 12:47.760]  biodiversity zone and just went in and killed the natives earlier this year the
[12:47.760 --> 12:54.440]  New York Times even reported but back of the paper that the UN in Central Africa
[12:54.440 --> 12:59.320]  and in South America in different countries would go in and they're like
[12:59.320 --> 13:04.960]  is it right the UN soldiers went in to the ancestral lands and burned down the
[13:04.960 --> 13:12.760]  villages and shot people they're like well it is for the earth of all places
[13:12.760 --> 13:16.680]  it's in Uganda where they say we need to invade because of a guy who hadn't been
[13:16.680 --> 13:20.120]  seen in six years that's just the cover oh we're there because the Kony and
[13:20.120 --> 13:23.600]  meanwhile the UN is lining them up and killing them in fact we guys type in UN
[13:23.600 --> 13:31.280]  killing people in Uganda for UN killing villagers in Uganda as part of
[13:31.280 --> 13:37.360]  environmental zones I mean what's frustrating is I know the UN is a murder
[13:37.360 --> 13:44.040]  crew the most murderous we've ever seen after Mao Zedong I know the globalist
[13:44.040 --> 13:48.640]  literally line up villages and just mow the people down and it's even in the
[13:48.640 --> 13:54.040]  news and then I got to watch Obama up there crying over Sandy Hook with no
[13:54.040 --> 13:57.840]  tears completely fake
[13:57.840 --> 14:05.240]  I mean I know what the globalists stand for I know who they are I know what
[14:05.240 --> 14:09.360]  their fruits are and I told everybody I said they're gonna massively increase
[14:09.360 --> 14:14.720]  taxes across the board scores of new taxes are going in right now scores on
[14:14.720 --> 14:20.880]  everybody they are going to continue to get us in debt yeah there it is armed
[14:20.880 --> 14:24.000]  troops burned down homes kill children to evict Ugandans in name of global
[14:24.000 --> 14:28.800]  warming neo-colonial land grabs carried out on behalf of World Bank based
[14:28.800 --> 14:34.600]  British company UN troops pull up block the roads the mercenaries go in and do
[14:34.600 --> 14:38.600]  the actual killing just like in the case of Uganda that you heard the UN dropped
[14:38.600 --> 14:41.960]  the ball of the million dead they didn't drop the ball they took out the ruling
[14:41.960 --> 14:45.760]  class Christians killed almost some estimates are over a million but the
[14:45.760 --> 14:49.240]  official has been under a million eight hundred thousand plus Christians who
[14:49.240 --> 14:56.160]  were the 10% minority who own most of the country they just came in with the
[14:56.160 --> 15:01.780]  UN and foreign mercs and the majority animist that's rock worshipping animal
[15:01.780 --> 15:05.960]  worshipping group and just slaughtered everyone I mean there's video and photos
[15:05.960 --> 15:11.520]  online of the UN troops chopping children up and burning them over fires
[15:11.520 --> 15:17.200]  just any and I and when I see Miss America or Miss USA because they're told
[15:17.200 --> 15:20.280]  do this to win this is what the judges want to hear they go I just want to
[15:20.280 --> 15:26.640]  thank the UN I just want to serve the UN the UN is just so great Oh Angelina Jolie
[15:26.640 --> 15:35.080]  and then you're getting your hair cut my son was getting his hair cut and I'm
[15:35.080 --> 15:39.880]  listening to this woman talking and she's going I just can't wait you know I
[15:39.880 --> 15:43.760]  want to go to college and be a UN you know delegate and I want to be an
[15:43.760 --> 15:47.520]  ambassador someday and I want to save people through the UN and she's got
[15:47.520 --> 15:51.760]  stars in her eyes and I'm like you know the UN runs giant mass murder operations
[15:51.760 --> 15:55.080]  and she just looks at me like I'm a terrorist and she's not a bad person
[15:55.080 --> 16:01.440]  it's just they believe a fantasy like a two-year-old that believes a fat guy in
[16:01.440 --> 16:08.480]  red pajamas is really coming down the chimney and it's not true so I knew
[16:08.480 --> 16:12.760]  100% what was gonna happen with the fiscal cliff I said the Republicans will
[16:12.760 --> 16:18.280]  sell out because they were already sold out it's like saying Beelzebub is gonna
[16:18.280 --> 16:22.840]  shell out to the devil Beelzebub is the devil
[16:22.840 --> 16:28.240]  it's like saying you know a grizzly bear is gonna sell out to the Bears he is a
[16:28.240 --> 16:35.520]  bear it's like saying a prostitute is gonna become a hooker it's like saying
[16:35.520 --> 16:40.400]  water is gonna become wet or fish are going to start swimming in the sea or
[16:40.400 --> 16:50.080]  sheep are going to start braying and buying a bad man and the problem is most
[16:50.080 --> 16:54.800]  people that know about this get cynical and go well the world's run by evil the
[16:54.800 --> 16:59.040]  public's too dumb to help I'll just join the evil when you do that everything
[16:59.040 --> 17:06.080]  collapses okay and you will be destroyed as well and and and and the world is
[17:06.080 --> 17:10.280]  giving into evil right now before I get into the fiscal cliff numbers you know
[17:10.280 --> 17:14.120]  Mexico roughly has three times and it's only about half the geographic area
[17:14.120 --> 17:22.640]  Mexico has three times the natural resources that the United States has and
[17:22.640 --> 17:28.280]  Mexico most cities outside tourist areas have sewage running down the street with
[17:28.280 --> 17:32.080]  children walking around with their ribs sticking out and it looks like the
[17:32.080 --> 17:35.520]  souls been sucked out of the people because they've been under tyranny so
[17:35.520 --> 17:40.240]  long that their very essence has been pulled out of them
[17:42.480 --> 17:47.840]  that's what corruption does and we're going under that where the elites live
[17:47.840 --> 17:52.040]  in their walled armored cities and they're not safe either and we're all
[17:52.040 --> 17:55.640]  out here in squalor and and and the establishment says they're doing this
[17:55.640 --> 18:01.080]  consciously by design that's what agenda 21 is is turning civilization on its
[18:01.080 --> 18:06.800]  head and building civilization around the destruction of civilization or a
[18:06.800 --> 18:10.600]  boot stomping on the human face forever a society that becomes more ugly more
[18:10.600 --> 18:17.440]  trampled trampled and being trampled upon aka 1984 so I've watched this done
[18:17.440 --> 18:21.320]  in the third world over and over again there's an IMF World Bank manual the
[18:21.320 --> 18:26.640]  112 points that's public since 2002 when it got leaked when stickles left how
[18:26.640 --> 18:30.640]  they engineer it how they collapse societies it's all a blueprint so I'm
[18:30.640 --> 18:33.920]  going okay and then you know it's like when you're reading Bambi to your kid
[18:33.920 --> 18:36.960]  okay honey I was reading my four-year-old I go this is a sad part where
[18:36.960 --> 18:42.440]  the mommy deer gets shot turn the page mommy gets shot on the next page I read
[18:42.440 --> 18:47.360]  Bambi probably 20 times I mean I know I probably had it read to me 20 or 30
[18:47.360 --> 18:52.560]  times and then I've read it 20 or 30 times I know how Bambi goes see and see
[18:52.560 --> 18:56.440]  I know how this goes it's not my opinion
[18:56.440 --> 19:03.160]  they're going to bankrupt us and the equation is about 90 percent of all the
[19:03.160 --> 19:07.800]  taxes will go to offshore banks who will then use it to come in and develop but
[19:07.800 --> 19:12.440]  only develop to drive down wages and turn green fields around their bases
[19:12.440 --> 19:17.120]  into squalid people living in cardboard boxes with one-third of the children
[19:17.120 --> 19:22.480]  born in Mexico City with a disorder where they have no upper brain they can
[19:22.480 --> 19:25.680]  breathe but there's no brain and the parents love them and take care of them
[19:25.680 --> 19:28.960]  but that's how toxic the waste is you never hear environmentalists talk about
[19:28.960 --> 19:32.440]  that because that's their program in fact Henry Kissinger documents came out
[19:32.440 --> 19:37.240]  where they said ship the toxic waste the third world well forget that there was
[19:37.240 --> 19:45.400]  one with summers Larry Summers put out a memo I think ten years ago or longer he
[19:45.400 --> 19:48.800]  was under Clinton saying let's ship the toxic waste down there to get rid of
[19:48.800 --> 19:54.840]  Brazilians I mean these people just sit around publicly writing let's send stuff

[24:16.840 --> 24:20.640]  red alert a moment again when I say something I always double-check it yeah
[24:20.640 --> 24:26.800]  Larry Summers in 1991 and Wikipedia has a link to the official memo that he put
[24:26.800 --> 24:29.760]  out we'll put that on screen go ahead and scroll down it's also in
[24:29.760 --> 24:36.960]  mainstream news where he said let's ship our toxic waste to Brazil that'll help
[24:36.960 --> 24:41.160]  get their population down as well
[24:44.040 --> 24:48.480]  and he goes over the reasons well you need to you need to be gotten rid of so
[24:48.480 --> 24:54.320]  again this is their attitude about you and they're gonna raise taxes where
[24:54.320 --> 24:57.000]  you're not gonna be able to live in the countryside they're going to live in the
[24:57.000 --> 25:00.440]  countryside you'll need to have tens of millions even live in the countryside
[25:00.440 --> 25:03.360]  soon if they have their way they're they're tearing up roads all over the
[25:03.360 --> 25:07.400]  country while building napta superhighways that are UN zones you've
[25:07.400 --> 25:11.760]  got to pay taxes on oh and by the way Perry just reauthorized that even the
[25:11.760 --> 25:16.680]  legislature voted it down what twice but separately on national news they'd say
[25:16.680 --> 25:19.760]  there's no napta superhighway even though it's all Department of
[25:19.760 --> 25:26.000]  Transportation official North American Union agreements I've got clips of CNN
[25:26.000 --> 25:30.760]  going Ron Paul is literally insane he is imagining something called a napta
[25:30.760 --> 25:35.960]  superhighway when we had billboards up all over Texas announcing it and they're
[25:35.960 --> 25:39.880]  building it and taking over our existing roads to pay for the building of it
[25:39.880 --> 25:43.840]  putting toll roads on I mean it's like hey we should arm our teachers like
[25:43.840 --> 25:47.480]  Israel Israel doesn't arm teachers that's a lie well no it's admitted
[25:47.480 --> 25:53.000]  here's Israeli news no no no such thing as Israeli news hey here's the memo
[25:53.000 --> 25:56.960]  where they say ship toxic waste to Latin America to kill their people but they
[25:56.960 --> 26:00.320]  want to open the borders to let them come in to drop down wages here it's not
[26:00.320 --> 26:02.640]  because they care about the Latin Americans it's because they want to
[26:02.640 --> 26:07.800]  destroy all our countries shut up racist but no they say they want to ship the
[26:07.800 --> 26:10.960]  toxic waste down there so one-third of their kids are born with this one
[26:10.960 --> 26:15.320]  disorder where they have literally no upper brain and have have no brain waves
[26:15.320 --> 26:19.480]  all they have is a brain stem be quiet racist oh what next you're gonna say the
[26:19.480 --> 26:28.080]  brain exists I mean this is just how the system responds and there ladies and
[26:28.080 --> 26:36.200]  gentlemen I was looking at the new issue of the magazine that about a week and a
[26:36.200 --> 26:42.840]  half ago we finished writing my letter editor's letter to the public when
[26:42.840 --> 26:46.200]  Feinstein did not put her bill out yet where I say they will physically come
[26:46.200 --> 26:49.400]  for the guns because I knew about their statements and what they'd said
[26:49.400 --> 26:54.400]  previously and how handgun control Inc and others had said look we're gonna
[26:54.400 --> 26:58.400]  physically get them in his next reelection they don't just brag to each
[26:58.400 --> 27:03.200]  other this is a this is a militarized mercenary globalist group these aren't
[27:03.200 --> 27:06.320]  liberals that's their cover and when they say something folks they're gonna
[27:06.320 --> 27:10.240]  try to do it when they're talking to each other well I mean when you get
[27:10.240 --> 27:14.200]  these mob Don's talking to each other this is battle plans like a general in a
[27:14.200 --> 27:17.920]  briefing room saying you know the airstrikes are gonna be here get me the
[27:17.920 --> 27:23.320]  satellite Intel I mean when they say it they mean it and so the new issues 2013

[27:26.280 --> 27:29.720]  in by executive order carbon taxes they're already shutting down the power
[27:29.720 --> 27:33.680]  plants they're gonna get rid of the borders Republicans have already
[27:33.680 --> 27:37.680]  announced that because the mega banks want it they've done it in every other
[27:37.680 --> 27:42.160]  region every other country everything you're seeing happen in the EU is gonna
[27:42.160 --> 27:47.640]  happen here they want to collapse everything they want you poor to totally
[27:47.640 --> 27:52.920]  control you plus they like it they love living on armored hills outside the city
[27:52.920 --> 27:59.000]  watching you live in cardboard boxes and watching your children die it's
[27:59.000 --> 28:04.240]  beautiful to them it makes them enjoy their wealth more when you're poor

[28:12.600 --> 28:16.200]  article total red alert total red alert and I'm gonna explain something to you
[28:16.200 --> 28:21.200]  no one I listen to mainline conservative talk radio and they're like oh yeah they
[28:21.200 --> 28:24.080]  want to bring back the old thing where you can't manufacture semi-auto anymore
[28:24.080 --> 28:30.960]  no no no the bill that Obama is supporting that's introduced tomorrow
[28:30.960 --> 28:36.960]  when Congress comes back in its public bill says we have the discretion to ban
[28:36.960 --> 28:41.640]  all guns and make you turn them in if we want it's got that footnote in it now
[28:41.640 --> 28:45.680]  they don't care what federal courts rule they're gonna do an executive order of
[28:45.680 --> 28:51.960]  that doesn't work here is the red alert red alert red alert red alert red alert
[28:51.960 --> 28:55.320]  red alert and I'm gonna have Nemo add to this the point that it's the nationwide

[33:32.920 --> 33:38.200]  first time listing on news stations all over the country I know my broadcast has
[33:38.200 --> 33:42.360]  sounded radical over the years and some people thought man that guy's crazy am I
[33:42.360 --> 33:47.120]  crazy now no the elites are out of control
[33:47.120 --> 33:51.880]  tyranny looks crazy to somebody that's not a tyrant and so I understand why
[33:51.880 --> 33:56.960]  hearing me report on stuff before it all unfolded sounded crazy but I was
[33:56.960 --> 34:02.080]  desperately trying to warn people to stop us from getting to this point but
[34:02.080 --> 34:07.720]  I've always said that once the real tyranny starts unfolding and Ron Paula
[34:07.720 --> 34:12.720]  said this as well that if we did our job and warn people that once it happened
[34:12.720 --> 34:20.200]  our credibility would go way up and then we'd have a chance to beat them but
[34:20.200 --> 34:24.640]  politics now is not like something that even if you're involved that's at a
[34:24.640 --> 34:29.160]  distance and you know you talk with your buddies at the golf course or around the
[34:29.160 --> 34:37.760]  water cooler folks it's time to drop everything and get really aggressive
[34:37.760 --> 34:44.960]  or it's over okay the globalist know that America was really starting to wake
[34:44.960 --> 34:51.120]  up to him so what do you do if you're a slave master and your slave starts
[34:51.120 --> 34:57.200]  getting out of line what does a pimp do America it really is the story of a
[34:57.200 --> 35:01.200]  prostitute this beautiful healthy farm girl thinks she'll go to Hollywood and
[35:01.200 --> 35:05.480]  be a star she gets there works at McDonald's can't can't get the star job
[35:05.480 --> 35:12.720]  she wants and they ask her do you want to be in pornography and then pretty
[35:12.720 --> 35:17.600]  soon she's a prostitute and by the way that's how show business works period
[35:17.600 --> 35:23.160]  I've never even tried to be in movies but have been offered a few times to be
[35:23.160 --> 35:28.560]  in some pretty big films by Tommy Pilata and Richard Linkletter and so I didn't
[35:28.560 --> 35:35.880]  have that experience there but then I got invited to go try out for some other
[35:35.880 --> 35:43.920]  movies and some of the people associated with the films didn't even know that I
[35:43.920 --> 35:49.400]  was already an established radio talk show host and already you know on I
[35:49.400 --> 35:53.280]  think about 15 stations at the time this had to be about 2,000 and I was still
[35:53.280 --> 35:57.000]  pretty skinny that it looked a lot more attractive than I do now and they point
[35:57.000 --> 36:05.240]  blank at one of these casting studios asked me if I wanted to be in porn and
[36:05.240 --> 36:08.240]  I was like are you kidding
[36:08.800 --> 36:12.960]  and that's just when you're at another meeting people want you to be in a TV
[36:12.960 --> 36:16.600]  show and then you're walking in the parking lot so my next door goes hey
[36:16.600 --> 36:22.560]  come on over here and it's a mainline system at that time associated with the
[36:22.560 --> 36:27.840]  city and you walk in there and there's all these people lined up trying to be
[36:27.840 --> 36:32.800]  stars and right in front of you they're asking women if they want to be in porn
[36:32.800 --> 36:37.840]  and they're asking you if you want to be in porn see that's how ubiquitous this
[36:37.840 --> 36:42.480]  is but I've already gone off into a porn analogy I never told that story
[36:44.480 --> 36:48.280]  that's how screwed up this is and everybody wants to be a star because
[36:48.280 --> 36:51.460]  you're nobody if you're not a star let me tell you something once you've been in
[36:51.460 --> 36:54.820]  movies been around movies they're totally unhappy people it's nothing
[36:54.820 --> 36:58.880]  it's nothing to be Brad Pitt it's nothing to be any of these people if
[36:58.880 --> 37:03.700]  there's nothing this is life this is what it is what's rewarding is being
[37:03.700 --> 37:08.140]  truthful and honorable and having children and raising a family and being
[37:08.140 --> 37:14.360]  strong the fame the garbage it means nothing but they control people with it
[37:14.360 --> 37:18.600]  but but but getting back to the analogy of America like a young farm girl from
[37:18.600 --> 37:28.320]  Kansas beautiful black hair green eyes just perfect complexion perfect
[37:28.320 --> 37:33.320]  proportions she goes to California because everybody told her she ought to
[37:33.320 --> 37:38.120]  be a movie star she was so pretty she was so smart and that's just what she
[37:38.120 --> 37:44.520]  should do five years later she is a heroin addict and a $20 hooker that
[37:44.520 --> 37:50.400]  nobody even wants to have sex with and then she's OD'd dead at the morgue
[37:50.400 --> 37:55.160]  that's happened tens of thousands of times in the last 50 years in Los Angeles
[37:55.160 --> 38:03.060]  alone if she would have gone out had an economy found a man had a business would
[38:03.060 --> 38:06.400]  have had children would have had a life would have been a grandmother would have
[38:06.400 --> 38:12.880]  fully fulfilled her destiny of being a wholesome human wrecked destroyed by
[38:12.880 --> 38:20.300]  Hollywood and you know how those pimps work they tell the young women well we
[38:20.300 --> 38:24.640]  can get you in movies but first you gotta prove yourself you got to go out
[38:24.640 --> 38:28.840]  and turn some tricks you're gonna have some sex with some people plus you're
[38:28.840 --> 38:32.640]  gonna like it they got money and stuff and so the 18 year old woman beautiful
[38:32.640 --> 38:38.880]  unpilfered might have lost their virginity these women go out and they
[38:38.880 --> 38:44.440]  try to get into the nastiest forms of sex try to make themselves like it so
[38:44.440 --> 38:49.520]  that they can then be in movies it's like learning how to be a sword
[38:49.520 --> 38:53.480]  swallower or a fire blower or something I'm telling you folks this is how it
[38:53.480 --> 38:57.160]  works I'm not gonna tell you any stories I'm
[38:57.160 --> 39:01.200]  just gonna tell you that's how it works these women try to learn how to hurt
[39:01.200 --> 39:07.840]  their bodies how to do things that they don't like so they can be a star and
[39:07.840 --> 39:14.720]  make $2,000 per film having somebody tear their body open and see that's
[39:14.720 --> 39:17.880]  America once they get you on the plantation once they get you as a
[39:17.880 --> 39:22.160]  sharecropper once they get you on welfare in the criminal justice system
[39:22.160 --> 39:28.000]  once they get you under their control under their socialist health care now
[39:28.000 --> 39:30.800]  they can tell you hey we got to kill old people to pay for young people how's that
[39:30.800 --> 39:36.200]  sound young people yeah kill people so I get a job see that's what collectivism
[39:36.200 --> 39:40.880]  is all about being under people's control where the state controls what
[39:40.880 --> 39:46.320]  movies are made where the state controls what films are made
[39:48.640 --> 39:52.080]  and with these evil people because I've run into them and around them and also
[39:52.080 --> 39:57.800]  history it's it's the enjoyment of hurting innocence it's the enjoyment of
[39:57.800 --> 40:03.080]  having like cattle cars delivered to Hollywood all the young gorgeous women
[40:03.080 --> 40:10.520]  of America and men now pile off to walk in where seedy hunchback demonic men and
[40:10.520 --> 40:14.480]  women sit there and poke at them and prod at them and and say what are you
[40:14.480 --> 40:16.920]  gonna do
[40:17.920 --> 40:23.560]  and these stars are told okay clean my house
[40:23.560 --> 40:29.080]  and do this and that and literally sit here while I do horrible things to you
[40:29.080 --> 40:31.920]  you know I mentioned this yesterday I'm gonna get into the ton of stuff they do
[40:31.920 --> 40:37.720]  and the most evil because they control the idea of being stars a fiat nothing
[40:37.720 --> 40:43.280]  fraud and they control the fiat Federal Reserve Notes they get the whole world
[40:43.280 --> 40:50.080]  on fake dreams and fake money the whole world by these magicians these fraudsters
[40:50.080 --> 40:57.360]  these these these these Bernie Madoff Ken Lay types and the whole world is run
[40:57.360 --> 41:03.960]  by these people now mafia criminals where the very worst rise to the top you
[41:03.960 --> 41:07.400]  know the film the Godfather is actually based on a composite of true stories
[41:07.400 --> 41:11.240]  Frank Sinatra you name it it's all in there that's a true story the Godfather
[41:11.240 --> 41:16.320]  is a true story it's a composite Mario Puzos
[41:16.320 --> 41:21.960]  and in it it's the story of the old New York Godfather they want to run all
[41:21.960 --> 41:28.880]  sorts of dirty stuff underage hookers heroin and he says I'm not gonna be part
[41:28.880 --> 41:34.760]  of it so they shoot him and then they get what they want they get and they say
[41:34.760 --> 41:37.680]  well I will just keep it in the black neighborhood they're animals anyways let
[41:37.680 --> 41:42.520]  them lose their souls and that's why those zones have been so
[41:42.520 --> 41:46.600]  destroyed because they were picked as the red-light district as a way to hurt
[41:46.600 --> 41:51.960]  those people and the same thing has now been done to everybody
[41:55.040 --> 42:02.160]  you know when I was growing up we wanted party a party beer we had to drive into
[42:02.160 --> 42:04.500]  Dallas and going to the black neighborhood we can walk right into a
[42:04.500 --> 42:08.720]  liquor store if you were 14 years old driving with your 16 year old buddy walk
[42:08.720 --> 42:11.760]  right into a black liquor store and they'd sell you alcohol and cops would
[42:11.760 --> 42:16.400]  walk you would watch you walk right out of the liquor store with beer or vodka
[42:16.400 --> 42:21.240]  or whatever because they were all getting paid off in Dallas Texas
[42:21.960 --> 42:27.440]  see that's what crimes all about they make things illegal so they can get a
[42:27.440 --> 42:33.560]  cut of it and anybody that's lived in a crime-run city knows that the naive
[42:33.560 --> 42:37.960]  people mainly the churchgoers who really think the world is what's going on their
[42:37.960 --> 42:51.120]  little church they are totally blind to this entire situation but a hundred
[42:51.120 --> 42:56.480]  times or more I jump in the back of the pickup truck with my older buddies and
[42:56.480 --> 43:02.360]  we drive into South Dallas you can hear guns going off in the background quite a
[43:02.360 --> 43:06.160]  few times and people try to mug you and everything else just just just to get
[43:06.160 --> 43:13.680]  beer so we could have a party and get the cheerleaders over and we drive back
[43:13.680 --> 43:18.640]  to the rich neighborhood we lived in by the golf course and everybody get drunk
[43:18.640 --> 43:24.000]  but the point is is that that's just one one hundredth of the stuff that goes on
[43:24.000 --> 43:30.840]  out there and corruption isn't cute it's it's it's sick it's horrible okay what
[43:30.840 --> 43:37.400]  corruption is it's a little family-owned restaurant where the organized crime
[43:37.400 --> 43:41.200]  comes in and says I want you to hire this person for me here and I want you
[43:41.200 --> 43:44.840]  to pay me 20% all your profits and my guys gonna make sure and you got to sit
[43:44.840 --> 43:48.360]  there while their thug comes in a few hours a day and tells you what to do and
[43:48.360 --> 43:54.760]  then the thug wants to have sex with your daughter so the the thug rapes your
[43:54.760 --> 44:00.520]  daughter one night in the parking lot and you you beat the brains out of the
[44:00.520 --> 44:04.360]  guy that did it and the police come and arrest you and tell you that you're
[44:04.360 --> 44:09.240]  gonna go to death row because you killed one of their guys and see they don't
[44:09.240 --> 44:14.760]  want you having a gun to protect yourself from them I'm gonna get into
[44:14.760 --> 44:18.000]  the fiscal cliff and open the phones up and everything else but you've got to
[44:18.000 --> 44:24.960]  understand how this works in America was like a beautiful supermodel that looked
[44:24.960 --> 44:30.080]  like Wonder Woman those countries and ships we call them women by the analogy
[44:30.080 --> 44:37.840]  fence and now we're a zombie crack whore in the back of a flat with beg bedbugs
[44:37.840 --> 44:42.440]  feeding on us and cigarette burns and cuts all over us and almost all the hair
[44:42.440 --> 44:47.100]  is falling out and she's got double black eyes and the pimp is running a
[44:47.100 --> 44:52.560]  needle up into her vein to give her an overdose and get rid of her
[44:52.800 --> 44:57.280]  that's how they get rid of him he's running he's but but see we haven't
[44:57.280 --> 45:00.160]  quite gotten to that point there's always a point where the hooker goes
[45:00.160 --> 45:05.320]  I'm going back to Kansas you know she's six months into it she's got diseases
[45:05.320 --> 45:08.960]  he's had to have an abortion she wants to get off the drugs she wants to go
[45:08.960 --> 45:13.440]  home to mommy and daddy and he walks in and he knocks her teeth out she falls
[45:13.440 --> 45:16.760]  down blood coming out takes out a coat hanger and starts beating her and
[45:16.760 --> 45:21.440]  beating her locks her up for a week in a closet don't don't don't cry just like
[45:21.440 --> 45:24.780]  Milwaukee when the cops were there Jeffrey Dahmer was authorized to do
[45:24.780 --> 45:27.520]  what he was doing nobody's coming to help you little kids and nobody's coming
[45:27.520 --> 45:30.560]  to help you lady and they lock her up in there and have starboard death and he
[45:30.560 --> 45:33.720]  comes back and says I'll give you some food but you don't you ever try to leave
[45:33.720 --> 45:39.640]  me again any year later she's dead dead on a dirty mattress and that's what
[45:39.640 --> 45:43.480]  they're gonna do to America just like they've done to Nigeria and Brazil
[45:43.480 --> 45:47.340]  they're gonna take us and they're gonna squeeze us out they're gonna strangle
[45:47.340 --> 45:51.680]  America because they like it they like watching that beauty go out of your eyes
[45:51.680 --> 45:56.080]  they like putting fluoride in your water and mercury in your shots when global
[45:56.080 --> 46:00.120]  let's walk into restaurants and see all the disease looking zombie little kids
[46:00.120 --> 46:04.280]  with the souls already sucked out of them they love it and they're gonna do
[46:04.280 --> 46:08.520]  it to all of you they're gonna take their time real good on all of you
[46:08.520 --> 46:12.600]  unless you wake up and realize who they are and that's why I'm here I'm here to
[46:12.600 --> 46:17.080]  tell you who they are because most people that know this stuff are cowards
[46:17.080 --> 46:21.720]  and they decide to join the evil they decide to serve this force because when
[46:21.720 --> 46:24.640]  you are smart enough to know about it you learn about it you know well I'm
[46:24.640 --> 46:31.360]  gonna play ball the only way to beat this is to not play ball with it now
[46:31.360 --> 46:37.080]  let's take Illinois famous state millions of hard-working immigrants from
[46:37.080 --> 46:43.740]  Poland and Germany and Ireland and Scotland went there and Italy and they
[46:43.740 --> 46:47.680]  took Chicago down with prohibition ten years of the gangsters being
[46:47.680 --> 46:50.720]  able to make hundreds of millions of dollars a month and that was in those
[46:50.720 --> 46:54.180]  days equivalent of billions a month and they took it over and it's been their
[46:54.180 --> 47:00.440]  talent ever since and we're on the radio there in Chicago and when I open the
[47:00.440 --> 47:03.600]  phones up I first want to give folks there a chance they've taken all your
[47:03.600 --> 47:09.000]  guns in Chicago now they want to do it system-wide in Illinois
[47:09.000 --> 47:13.680]  now they want to do it system-wide in Illinois and how's that working out for
[47:13.680 --> 47:18.680]  you five hundred plus murders last year and people get mugged when when three
[47:18.680 --> 47:22.720]  four times felons are out there with guns nobody's gonna stop the felons the
[47:22.720 --> 47:27.880]  highest crime rates are where they take the guns and now Illinois moves to
[47:27.880 --> 47:34.120]  outlaw modern firearms and criminalize owners Illinois State President John
[47:34.120 --> 47:37.800]  Cullerton will reportedly introduce a draconian bill today and now it's
[47:37.800 --> 47:42.040]  happened in the Illinois legislature that will effectively ban all modern
[47:42.040 --> 47:45.880]  firearms criminalize their owners and subject their guns to confiscation by
[47:45.880 --> 47:48.880]  the Illinois State Police they're not the Illinois State Police they're the
[47:48.880 --> 47:53.720]  mafia enforcers the proposed oh yeah when the mafia has been running stuff
[47:53.720 --> 47:57.680]  for 80 years they wear uniforms the proposed outlawing of firearms was
[47:57.680 --> 48:02.640]  confirmed by the NRA's Illinois rep according to Robert Farago writing for
[48:02.640 --> 48:06.720]  the truth about guns website the move coincides with the federal effort by
[48:06.720 --> 48:10.520]  Diane Feinstein to introduce legislation outlawing all semiotic
[48:10.520 --> 48:15.360]  semi-automatic firearms and imposing de facto confiscation and the bill will
[48:15.360 --> 48:24.200]  also shut down John ranges it gets into that and Kurt's adding more to this
[48:24.200 --> 48:31.600]  article right now at info wars calm red link red alert and I'm telling you
[48:31.600 --> 48:38.120]  ladies and gentlemen that's why you shouldn't be in to all the stuff that's

[48:43.000 --> 48:47.320]  aiding them hurting all these innocent young women where they try to make it
[48:47.320 --> 48:53.960]  look so glamorous most of those women end up dead or in prison look it up when
[48:53.960 --> 48:58.640]  you when you aid this government you're helping them run murder operations right

[49:05.960 --> 49:08.840]  their houses oh you're not gonna hear Angelina Jolie's talk about how that's

[51:07.520 --> 51:11.520]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energy czar
[51:11.520 --> 51:15.440]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[51:15.440 --> 51:19.440]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[51:19.440 --> 51:23.840]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid
[51:23.840 --> 51:28.040]  is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[51:28.040 --> 51:31.720]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[51:31.720 --> 51:35.440]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather

[54:20.120 --> 54:23.720]  there's a good chance this total semi-auto gun ban banning of shooting
[54:23.720 --> 54:32.120]  ranges SWAT teaming of gun owners will pass the Illinois legislature and then
[54:32.120 --> 54:35.760]  it'll take five years to beat it in court federal court you know just ruled
[54:35.760 --> 54:38.360]  how you can't deny people the right to keep and bear arms you can't deny them the
[54:38.360 --> 54:45.360]  right to concealed carry their answer is oh really really Mac you heard Al Capone
[54:45.360 --> 54:50.720]  do whatever we want these people are our slaves they've all got bodyguards the
[54:50.720 --> 54:55.640]  rest of it incredible article up at infowarsk.com and police all over the
[54:55.640 --> 54:59.800]  country on record have been training to confiscate firearms for a long time
[54:59.800 --> 55:03.400]  there's another big article remember we did this six months ago a video with Rob
[55:03.400 --> 55:07.420]  do a special report US military training to kill Americans that don't turn in
[55:07.420 --> 55:11.200]  guns and their own army training manual we had the latest on that up at
[55:11.200 --> 55:16.040]  infowarsk.com Obama would call a military to disarm Americans during
[55:16.040 --> 55:20.280]  national emergency and we've got a police lieutenant talking about how
[55:20.280 --> 55:23.080]  they're training for the roll out of martial law now that doesn't mean it's
[55:23.080 --> 55:27.360]  going to happen they tell the police this to gauge and watch you to see who
[55:27.360 --> 55:34.200]  says they won't go along with it it's part of a profiling operation but all
[55:34.200 --> 55:38.400]  over the United States they're setting up quote gang checkpoints now where they
[55:38.400 --> 55:42.240]  set up highway checkpoints ransack your car and take photos of your tattoos
[55:42.240 --> 55:46.800]  that's in the Associated Press I'm gonna be getting to that I mean this is just
[55:46.800 --> 55:51.360]  it's on the homeland security was set up for gun owners veterans conservatives
[55:51.360 --> 55:55.080]  they're gonna take America down they're gonna bring us into a depression and you
[55:55.080 --> 55:58.840]  think 50 million on food stamps is bad how about a hundred how about 200 million
[55:58.840 --> 56:04.640]  even if you don't like the globalist you're gonna go to them on your knees
[56:04.640 --> 56:11.240]  because they're gonna run your life this is the mafia takeover of America this is
[56:11.240 --> 56:19.120]  the breaking of America and that's why they report Senate passes deal means
[56:19.120 --> 56:25.000]  higher taxes on 77% of households and coming up the next hour we have the
[56:25.000 --> 56:29.600]  clip of Obama pledging nobody under 250 thou a year would have a tax increase
[56:29.600 --> 56:35.680]  folks he's raised more than 10 different taxes on people different ways but see
[56:35.680 --> 56:39.920]  as long as you get an Obama phone it's okay he'd never lie to you fiscal cliff
[56:39.920 --> 56:45.880]  deal one dollar in spending cuts for every 41 in tax increases
[56:47.520 --> 56:52.600]  and of course Paul Ryan voted for it Romney's owned by the same bank so is
[56:52.600 --> 56:59.120]  Paul Ryan this is a plan these people are in charge because they are globalist
[56:59.120 --> 57:05.280]  and only fully waking up to it will save us
[57:05.280 --> 57:10.160]  you tune into mainline conservative talk radio they're like oh yeah you know the
[57:10.160 --> 57:14.160]  Democrats will get it going for our guns you know and Rand Paul's like yeah let
[57:14.160 --> 57:17.680]  them raise taxes that means they'll lose the next election the fix is in in most

[58:02.760 --> 58:06.480]  year to get the assault weapons bill passed in the face of ferocious
[58:06.480 --> 58:10.560]  opposition from the National Rifle Association she says she got the best
[58:10.560 --> 58:16.400]  she could if I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States
[58:16.400 --> 58:23.960]  for an outright ban picking up every one of them mr. and mrs. America turn them
[58:23.960 --> 58:29.680]  all in I would have done it I could not do that and now she's gotten the votes

[01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:10.920]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers
[01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:18.960]  well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from
[01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:23.360]  Austin Texas Alex Jones
[01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:36.720]  we've got a audio clip of a man that said he's a police lieutenant I don't
[01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:39.720]  need to deny that because he sounds credible and I have it all over the news
[01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:43.080]  they're preparing for gun confiscation I'm saying they're getting ready to come
[01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:45.920]  take our guns so now I mean it's just all out in the open we have an article
[01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:50.960]  where the Pentagon admits it but I won't open the phones up for police
[01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:55.120]  specifically if you're training for civil unrest and gun confiscation and
[01:00:55.120 --> 01:01:01.240]  what you're being told only police and then after that every take a few calls
[01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:05.440]  from them folks have been begging to hear from Obama supporters and Obama
[01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:11.160]  supporters can call in normally when the phones are open not many of them um end
[01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:14.800]  up doing it and they seem to call in and go well I just don't like Romney and I'm
[01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:19.240]  like don't you get it Obama was the heir apparent Romney was like the placeholder
[01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:24.520]  the dummy the decoy like a dummy that Obama fought with Obama's a puppet too
[01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:28.720]  but they want him to do it because the left loves it when he orders torture or
[01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:33.600]  wireless wiretapping or murdering people and you know u.s. military invading all
[01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:38.880]  over Africa every African country I mean they think that's really cool because
[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:44.480]  he's part black and I mean it's just it's cool I mean it's it's like it's I
[01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:50.680]  mean he's I mean his dad was reportedly Kenyan or part Kenyan I mean it's it's
[01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:56.880]  over I mean it he could he could poach the brains of small children and eat
[01:01:56.880 --> 01:02:01.920]  them for breakfast it'd be beautiful because he I mean look he's got melanin
[01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:06.600]  in his skin I mean it's like it's okay
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:14.720]  it's trendy I mean it's really cool Obama won yeah yeah we won you know the
[01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:18.440]  people that are into that stuff and if Romney would have won they'd be the same
[01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:22.480]  agenda and you'd have a bunch of Republicans going back to sleep running
[01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:26.200]  around going hey we won we won well Romney wants our guns we'll turn them in
[01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:30.960]  well Romney but see they don't need to play that anymore because America is
[01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:37.440]  more than 50% quote minority now and they've got around 90% of the quote
[01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:42.760]  minorities voting for Obama because I mean obviously he's not a racist white
[01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:47.760]  person and obviously owning a gun means you're in the Klan I mean it doesn't
[01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:53.280]  make any sense but that matter I mean it's true because they said so and so
[01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:56.840]  that is the law law land that we've entered so I want to give the number out
[01:02:56.840 --> 01:03:02.720]  for police officers only just specifically call in about this eight
[01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:06.880]  hundred two five nine nine two three one eight hundred two five nine nine two
[01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:11.360]  three one and congressional fraud investigator in a RAM com for
[01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:15.800]  whistleblower Bob Fletcher will be joining us to talk about all this in the
[01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:21.080]  third hour we'll also have open phones as well make sure Fletcher knows he
[01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:23.600]  knows he's coming on talk about the gun grab and all the tyranny in Congress
[01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:27.120]  right okay he doesn't know that good because he can talk about so much what a
[01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:35.400]  what an interesting person but again not just politically in my gut I'm totally
[01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:42.500]  freaked out because my I have good instincts and they are just like a
[01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:48.840]  firehouse alarm going off I mean it I'm jumping out of bed you know at 5 30 in
[01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:53.840]  the morning now having no trouble not feeling sleepy I could work myself to
[01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:58.320]  death if I didn't control myself because I realize I have actually gone up
[01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:02.080]  against mass murdering total evil criminals who plan a total takeover a
[01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:05.960]  purge you name it because I know going along with them won't save us they plan
[01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:10.400]  to totally gut America once they get the guns they're gonna bring us into total
[01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:14.040]  depression and that's why they're going for this right now and I pray to God
[01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:19.200]  that all the brain numb entranced people out there will break out of their trance
[01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:24.040]  right now and realize the power you have because if you telegraph the message to
[01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:28.120]  the criminals that hey we know your criminal we know your insider traders we
[01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:31.480]  know you work for foreign banks we know your ship in narcotics they do all this
[01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:35.960]  publicly now we know your murderers that run al-qaeda we know you stage 9-11 they
[01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:39.680]  may be forced to back off but if they think you're gonna go along with it the
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:42.840]  reason they're so arrogant is they're about to pull false flags I mean I can
[01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:46.920]  just tell you right now false flags are probably in the offing as we speak they
[01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:50.440]  pull the trigger on operations that'll be happening very soon unless we get the
[01:04:50.440 --> 01:05:00.160]  word out 800-259-9231 800-259-9231 police straight ahead stay with us

[01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:59.480]  the fact that we're on over 140 stations shows we can beat this as things get
[01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:04.400]  worse I get put on more stations because people go wait this is true we got a we
[01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:08.640]  got to save America why haven't they killed me yet because it'll make

[01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:21.520]  everything I said and look I'm ready okay I don't want to die believe me but
[01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:26.800]  it's in God's hands I am at peace I'm at peace when it comes to being attacked
[01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:30.460]  set up destroyed whatever the case is I've given it to God because there's no
[01:11:30.460 --> 01:11:36.160]  future anyways if we don't beat them okay it's very very simple you know I
[01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:40.600]  liken it to some of the true stories where a ship has capsized there's been a
[01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:44.020]  lot of cases of this and people are caught in the inner bulkheads and the
[01:11:44.020 --> 01:11:48.040]  water slowly rising and there's women and children in there and you've seen
[01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:52.840]  this in movies reenacted and multiple men go and drowned trying to get out and
[01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:57.460]  finally one of them finds a passage out holding their breath five minutes to
[01:11:57.460 --> 01:12:01.280]  find a passage back through and to get rescued and to get people you know in
[01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:05.500]  there to save the women and children or to or to find a blowtorch to come cut
[01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:09.960]  their way through on the top and it's the same thing I am in the tunnel
[01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:14.360]  underwater folks trying to get out of here to get back and cut into the bulkhead
[01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:18.600]  and get people out if I die it doesn't matter I'm not gonna sit here with women
[01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:23.980]  and children as the water rises like a rat hearing them scream and cry I'm in
[01:12:23.980 --> 01:12:29.260]  the tunnel right now folks swimming as hard as I can and and getting out of
[01:12:29.260 --> 01:12:34.000]  this thing means you waking up you are Alex Jones making it to the other end
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:38.400]  finding the blowtorch or calling the Coast Guard and getting in there and
[01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:43.200]  cutting through and getting the people out you've got to help me because we're
[01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:47.360]  all together folks you right now are in that bulkhead with the water coming in
[01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:52.300]  and you're like man this is scary yeah we're the water is rising you're like
[01:12:52.300 --> 01:12:58.080]  but it's scary okay it's scary we got to swim out of here but there's all these
[01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:00.940]  different directions we don't know if you're really gonna find oxygen we know
[01:13:00.940 --> 01:13:06.640]  we're gonna die here so I'll go straight you go left you go right you know how
[01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:11.620]  many men are there here let's let's do we got to go we got to go but we could
[01:13:11.620 --> 01:13:16.880]  die look we're gonna die anyways don't you get it
[01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:23.100]  the toll-free number to join us is eight hundred two five nine nine two three one
[01:13:23.100 --> 01:13:27.680]  they're not gonna move slow in the takeover anymore homeland security was
[01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:31.900]  designed and set up the whole time from day one for gun owners conservatives
[01:13:31.900 --> 01:13:36.320]  libertarians that was all going on under Bush the conservative side just wouldn't
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:41.720]  pick up on it because it didn't compute then under Obama he announced it because
[01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:45.500]  now it was time for that not because Democrats were in but because the
[01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:49.600]  timeline had been moved up because now they'd shifted into the new paradigm
[01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:53.840]  we're gonna go to Gordon who's a police officer in Indiana here in a moment the
[01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:58.880]  toll-free number for police officers preparing for civil unrest your take on
[01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:02.480]  Feinstein saying we're gonna take the semi-autos make you turn them in the
[01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:07.120]  bills introduced tomorrow going in the Illinois legislature today I mean it's
[01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:13.280]  on the Illinois State House it's on I've got the bill number up at info Wars
[01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:17.960]  calm we've got all the articles about it it's on
[01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:24.160]  and so even if my family is in danger it doesn't matter there's no future form if
[01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:30.880]  we don't beat this the only hope is taking action
[01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:36.520]  it's the only hope we've got and I'm always about attacking on multiple
[01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:39.880]  fronts because we never know what's gonna work the best that's why I say
[01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:44.120]  I'll go straight you go left right somebody go up somebody go down you know
[01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:48.560]  we got to swim out through this doorway in this flooded ship we got to go out
[01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:52.800]  there we got a don't panic hold your breath you can go four or five minutes
[01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:56.640]  but you've got to control yourselves and not have fear because it's the same
[01:14:56.640 --> 01:15:02.360]  thing I've been able to before to swim it's always my mind that makes me stop
[01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:09.280]  I don't know two and a half Olympic lengths back when I was about 25 years
[01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:13.600]  old now I can only do about one and a half links underwater and you just kind
[01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:17.160]  of like almost mesmerize yourself and just relax they got skin divers that can
[01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:19.840]  go down for you know ten minutes but they've trained themselves and trained
[01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:23.720]  their lungs and their blood system so I'm nothing I'm just saying both people
[01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:28.440]  can't swim in a in a small you know private pool 50 yards underwater 30
[01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:34.440]  yards underwater and I liken it to the same thing politically you've got to get
[01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:39.880]  over the fear and realize the greater fear is letting these people win 800 to
[01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:46.240]  5 at 9 9 2 3 1 for police to call in it's now out in the open Illinois says
[01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:49.120]  they're gonna take all the semi-autos and then maybe everything else later
[01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:52.440]  under the Floyd card we told you that was coming get you registered then take
[01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:55.040]  it Diane Feinstein saying we want to take
[01:15:55.040 --> 01:16:02.080]  mr. and mrs. America's guns it's just amazing that all of this has happened
[01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:05.920]  and then coming up I'll get into the fiscal cliff they just use that as a way
[01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:09.520]  to jack up taxes they use that as of course they didn't cut spending of
[01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:16.560]  course it's all expanding of course they raise it on 77% of people in America and
[01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:23.100]  and Obama promised he wouldn't they're gangsters they want your money let's go
[01:16:23.100 --> 01:16:26.920]  ahead and go to Gordon who's a police officer in Indiana what's your take on
[01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:32.760]  all this well I want to say I haven't listened to your show for quite a while
[01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:37.520]  like the Bible says you will not you shall know them by their works I'm a
[01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:44.800]  police officer in Indiana here and I'm also black and I'm I am totally against
[01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:50.840]  this Obama thing about wanting to take a gun I've spoken to spoken to several
[01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:58.560]  officers and also to several citizens black citizens I should say they all say
[01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:04.640]  they're not going to give up their guns out of it it's uh I mean it's it's uh
[01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:13.480]  it's clear that uh that that that they want a total takeover of the United
[01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:17.480]  States and they know they can only do it by disarming us and I for one I'm not
[01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:22.320]  going to go door-to-door trying to take the citizens guns away because it's
[01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:26.080]  clearly against the Constitution what do you think about the state police who are
[01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:31.160]  specifically trained to do this this is going to become a very unhealthy job
[01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:38.600]  yes I was I was a member of our SWAT team here years ago and the newer
[01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:44.720]  members here are actually hooked up with the state police and one officer in
[01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:51.280]  particular actually has a one of those tracking devices embedded in his tooth I
[01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:55.280]  thought it was a joke and as I when I spoke to him found out he really did
[01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:59.440]  have one put in his tooth and I know they make it real elitist I have a
[01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:04.160]  cousin who's in special ops about seven years ago he goes yeah we were in a
[01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:08.760]  briefing with officers 200 of us and they said we're all gonna get chips the
[01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:12.600]  next time I saw him he said don't ask me about it anymore they know I'm talking
[01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:16.480]  to you and it's all classified and he said he won't even talk to me now I
[01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:20.320]  mean he'll say hi and stuff but he acts like I'm a rattlesnake and they all got
[01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:24.720]  microchips yeah the cops are getting him look and they tell you like it's real
[01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:29.760]  elitist like you're gonna get a chip cuz you're elite and they're they're MJTF
[01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:33.480]  thing multi-jurisdictional task forcing the police now they're taking the quote
[01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:38.240]  special units and making them special response to federal events yeah I mean
[01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:43.760]  it's a takeover and and and so this guy got a microchip tell us about that
[01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:51.640]  yes microchip embedded in his tooth and supposedly is what he was the only one
[01:18:51.640 --> 01:18:56.840]  on the team so far so far they've done it and here in the city but uh other
[01:18:56.840 --> 01:19:03.080]  members of this it's like a multi-jurisdictional SWAT team that they
[01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:05.960]  they've come up with in the last I think three years
[01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:10.520]  yeah it's MJTF that's how they dissolve they give the funding to the MJTF and
[01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:16.200]  basically dissolve the counties and cities in the end exactly well listen
[01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:20.400]  you ought to ask him to call back sometime how they talked him into it
[01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:23.480]  because I'm sure it was the federal grant Mexico's done this as well with
[01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:27.400]  their police you can that's MSNBC we guys type in Mexican police officials to
[01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:34.160]  get implanted chips and teeth or in skin it's MSNBC AP Reuters amazing and then
[01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:39.000]  call back in and tell miss tell us how they sold it to him anything else sir I
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:43.880]  just I just want to let the American people know let them know that not every

[01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:22.240]  you know I I have a video and audio up at info wars calm North Carolina police
[01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:26.640]  listen it warns of plans to set up martial law in 2013 that's coming up the

[01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:36.160]  add that to the alt market article that I I didn't find you think they want to
[01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:41.320]  put in the piece they did that it's a syndicated radio host and butch has
[01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:45.880]  broken so many big stories he broke the clergy response team and then we really
[01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:50.840]  broke it big with the pastors and the pastors even got FEMA visits and then
[01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:54.240]  later the media the government declassified their training pastors to
[01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:58.480]  tell people to submit to tyranny but I want to get butch on today or tomorrow
[01:24:58.480 --> 01:25:04.240]  to pop in he had been on a while he's on eight o'clock central on GCN live calm
[01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:08.240]  and syndicated around the country he's a pastor he'll call himself West
[01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:12.960]  Virginia hillbilly but I call him a red-blooded great guy and he he
[01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:16.720]  interviewed this guy and it's it's chilling it's real and what the guy says
[01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:21.040]  is actually in the news in pieces see it isn't just police calling in with this
[01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:25.520]  and then oh well they said they were a cop I already know all this it's just
[01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:29.400]  good for you to hear it now they're telling these police they're gonna drop
[01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:33.080]  the hammer in the next month well they said that back during the election
[01:25:33.080 --> 01:25:36.800]  they're just it's a psychological tactic where they keep saying there's gonna be
[01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:41.960]  martial law or even if you're against martial law it's kind of like when I was
[01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:45.360]  growing up I say I've been in 200 fights of a hundred plus of them were you know
[01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:49.120]  six seventh eighth grade where I got beat up by bullies you know a couple
[01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:53.640]  times a week that's how I got tough so a lot of more like really hardcore serious
[01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:57.720]  fights but you know teeth loose black eyes stuff like that and I just remember
[01:25:57.720 --> 01:26:01.080]  by the time I was in about seventh grade and been in about you know 50 60 fights
[01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:05.080]  some big bully who'd flunked three grades said I'm gonna be meeting you
[01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:10.360]  outside after school you know I wouldn't try to walk around and in the woods and
[01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:14.800]  and you know get home or pick up a bus down the street I'd go right out run
[01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:20.020]  right up and punch him right in the nose and see it's the same tactic martial law
[01:26:20.020 --> 01:26:23.400]  martial law martial law you you know they're gonna attack Iran they're gonna
[01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:26.480]  attack Iraq they're gonna attack Syria you kind of just get to where you're
[01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:31.840]  like well come on and get it done then so it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy
[01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:34.920]  I'm gonna go to Eli in Missouri who's a police officer we're finishing up Gordon
[01:26:34.920 --> 01:26:38.520]  Indiana anything else you wanted to add about the police and private citizens
[01:26:38.520 --> 01:26:43.320]  you talked to a lot of Obama supporters said all Alex I'm gonna vote for Obama
[01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:47.200]  he won't come after my guns and I said look it's not that Obama's any bad or
[01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:51.920]  good compared to Romney it's that he's who they want and I said Romney was for
[01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:58.960]  banning guns to go ahead yeah actually I didn't vote for Obama I wanted Ron Paul
[01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:05.040]  and a lot of the officers we have on the department who are you know part
[01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:08.320]  military and then you know they go between the military and a police
[01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:13.400]  department they wanted Ron Paul but uh is this a big wake-up call for people
[01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:19.480]  now that it's just openly we're gonna take the guns you know a lot of them I
[01:27:19.480 --> 01:27:22.920]  actually don't know until I speak to speak with him myself you know they
[01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:26.680]  they're not you know they that's another thing this is hardly getting the news
[01:27:26.680 --> 01:27:30.800]  it's getting one tenth the news it deserves it's hardly even conservatives
[01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:37.400]  don't even know exactly I I found it interesting that I'm our lustrous mayor
[01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:45.280]  just recently uh called up for the state police help from the government to
[01:27:45.280 --> 01:27:49.360]  governor to get the state police and the National Guard to come here in the city
[01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:53.480]  to help patrol the city and I found it odd because it's it we're not really
[01:27:53.480 --> 01:27:58.600]  that bad oh yeah all over the country they're saying all the armies here to
[01:27:58.600 --> 01:28:04.800]  help where are you in Indianapolis where are you in Indiana our Gary and now they

[01:28:24.760 --> 01:28:29.320]  know this because like I said the city isn't that bad off I mean it's bad but
[01:28:29.320 --> 01:28:32.480]  it's not that bad no no that's what listen there are articles all over the
[01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:35.680]  news going oh it's great to have the National Guard on the streets they're
[01:28:35.680 --> 01:28:39.800]  helping sweep for guns and cars no it's great to have the troops on the streets

[01:28:48.040 --> 01:28:53.000]  officer in Missouri what is your take on all this well I have a couple ideas
[01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:57.920]  about how it's going to be implemented but first I wanted to tell you something
[01:28:57.920 --> 01:29:03.040]  that I haven't heard covered very much other than you you've touched on the
[01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:10.720]  fact that there's ATF rules are not laws but just rules that are asking gunshots
[01:29:10.720 --> 01:29:15.480]  to do certain things for them and one of them that I've personally experienced is
[01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:24.800]  that they instruct the gunshots to send an email to police departments every
[01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:31.120]  time a purchase is made where there are multiple guns purchased so almost daily
[01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:36.720]  especially lately I receive an email every time someone was in the
[01:29:36.720 --> 01:29:39.680]  jurisdiction where I work purchase and then that's going into your threat
[01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:43.560]  fusion Center for the NSA but they use you as the cover stay there I want to

[01:33:22.240 --> 01:33:28.240]  of history since the beginning of time it has refinements technological advances
[01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:33.680]  and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction of human freedom but like
[01:33:33.680 --> 01:33:39.480]  every one of the super states that preceded it it has one iron rule logic
[01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:43.320]  is an enemy and truth is a menace
[01:33:43.320 --> 01:33:59.600]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 right you're listening to the Alex Jones show the
[01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:07.840]  answer to 1984 1776 a pastor Butch Paul Genesis syndicated talk show host pastor
[01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:11.200]  will be joining us here in about 10 minutes we're able to get him lined up
[01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:15.280]  on the ISDN line we're connecting right now and again I saw this story and info
[01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:20.280]  wars calm from alt market North Carolina police lieutenant warns the plans for
[01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:23.840]  martial law I was like I wonder what show that was and I went and looked and
[01:34:23.840 --> 01:34:27.760]  it's pastor Bush and you'd think we need it so we so we've added it to the report
[01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:32.400]  and info wars calm curtain mo is adding it right now it's important to add so
[01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:36.160]  people know where a report came from I see that more and more where the
[01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:39.920]  internet grabs stuff and then doesn't vet it well I can vet pastor butch Paul
[01:34:39.920 --> 01:34:43.040]  and what he's saying is it's all actually in the news they're training
[01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:47.200]  for martial law and gun confiscation and now they're saying and you're like well
[01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:50.960]  that's crazy that'll cause a revolution that's what Homeland Security and all
[01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:55.480]  the spying and all the SWAT teams are for the globalists are gonna bring us
[01:34:55.480 --> 01:34:58.840]  into total depression they can't have you armed they want you to be at the
[01:34:58.840 --> 01:35:02.840]  mercy of the rioting hordes and everything this this is a giant
[01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:09.920]  re-education takeover of America now a gun shop here in Austin over a year and
[01:35:09.920 --> 01:35:15.480]  a half ago gave me ATF letters and they're so intimidated by ATF they said
[01:35:15.480 --> 01:35:19.600]  don't tell anybody this that you know that it came from us because the ATF
[01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:23.160]  swagger Zen threatens people it's like a movie you know when the Mafia comes in
[01:35:23.160 --> 01:35:27.000]  the store I mean they they tell you listen Mac you do we say or you're gonna
[01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:31.640]  be and that in four states but now it's nationwide it was a test outside of law
[01:35:31.640 --> 01:35:35.440]  it's a rule it's total criminality the same folks that did Fast and Furious
[01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:39.720]  the criminals on average some of the good ATF people are the ones that first
[01:35:39.720 --> 01:35:44.280]  blew the whistle they go into shops everywhere now and they say you're going
[01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:50.800]  to send an email to the Threat Fusion Center so I would guess our caller from
[01:35:50.800 --> 01:35:55.640]  Missouri's a detective because those computer files are assigned to the local
[01:35:55.640 --> 01:36:02.440]  regional MJTF Threat Fusion Center that are really illegal CIA NSA bases and by
[01:36:02.440 --> 01:36:07.080]  the way that's now admitted that they're CIA NSA and so they just use you as
[01:36:07.080 --> 01:36:10.800]  their cannon fodder and can tell people oh the local terrorism number is the
[01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:16.280]  local police but then that's all filed into their larger system and see that
[01:36:16.280 --> 01:36:19.320]  way when the globalists are planning a terror attack or something they also
[01:36:19.320 --> 01:36:24.200]  know if local police have gotten on to it see because all the online police if
[01:36:24.200 --> 01:36:29.360]  you're tracking real terrorism and you're filing it with the feds you
[01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:32.640]  that's how you end up getting shot by a quote crack dealer when you're going out
[01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:35.960]  to your car see if they're already gonna run a terror operation a false flag and
[01:36:35.960 --> 01:36:39.400]  you were already on it you're dead
[01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:45.000]  and that's why you always see cops die around a terror attack a few days before
[01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:49.160]  because they'll kill whoever knows about it much I mean dozens got killed before
[01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:54.600]  9-11 FBI agents the FBI deputy director head of counterterrorism O'Neill I mean
[01:36:54.600 --> 01:36:58.800]  they will kill you before they do it so they're also watching to see what the
[01:36:58.800 --> 01:37:03.760]  citizens notice that's one of the biggest NSA functions I can I revealed
[01:37:03.760 --> 01:37:07.840]  this about five years ago with my NSA sources well one of them of course is
[01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:11.760]  former NSA with his sources Wayne Madsen who had to leave the country for a while
[01:37:11.760 --> 01:37:16.000]  because of death threats he was at the NSA that the main NSA thing is not just
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:21.120]  stealing patents and watching people and spying on political opposition you know
[01:37:21.120 --> 01:37:25.160]  it's like Nixon don't to the power of infinity but that what they're really
[01:37:25.160 --> 01:37:30.640]  doing is they're watching the local police departments because local police
[01:37:30.640 --> 01:37:34.480]  departments will find out about drug shipments if they're not corrupt they've
[01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:38.600]  got to be called off that case you know if it's a federal shipment of drugs most
[01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:41.640]  of it is federal right to the big banks that run the country and longer the
[01:37:41.640 --> 01:37:46.600]  money publicly our military grows the opium on video publicly so they couldn't
[01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:51.160]  hide it so they said okay we grow the opium move along they ship the drugs in
[01:37:51.160 --> 01:37:54.760]  move along they launder the drug money move along they own the private prisons
[01:37:54.760 --> 01:37:59.500]  owned by the big banks that run the drugs the drug dealers own the the
[01:37:59.500 --> 01:38:04.520]  prisons see the real business isn't just the drugs it's slaves in the prisons
[01:38:04.520 --> 01:38:08.560]  working for 25 cents an hour but I'm ranting and of course a lot of them
[01:38:08.560 --> 01:38:12.300]  deserve to be in prison they're unsavory horrible people the point is is they're
[01:38:12.300 --> 01:38:15.480]  unsavory and horrible a lot of them because since they were 12 years old
[01:38:15.480 --> 01:38:21.640]  they were forced into that culture but sad issue the point is is that see
[01:38:21.640 --> 01:38:25.280]  that's the problem with my broadcast he brings something up as well you're the
[01:38:25.280 --> 01:38:30.360]  only person I've heard touch on this we wrote articles about it but yes then I
[01:38:30.360 --> 01:38:33.960]  give you the rest of the story and I can go on for three hours just on this alone
[01:38:33.960 --> 01:38:38.360]  okay and it's all totally illegal so I'm gonna shut up for two minutes to know
[01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:41.920]  you're a busy man and we got pastor butch coming on here in a moment but we're
[01:38:41.920 --> 01:38:47.680]  gonna air that police lieutenant clip first but start at the beginning with
[01:38:47.680 --> 01:38:53.960]  now gun owners all over the country are having basically a criminal file opened
[01:38:53.960 --> 01:39:00.240]  on them that'll be used for the later confiscation later or to see if they you
[01:39:00.240 --> 01:39:03.600]  know sold the gun to their brother or gave it to their grandson because in the
[01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:08.400]  future it's going to be a felony if you give your grandson retroactively a
[01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:13.880]  firearm that's all been announced go ahead well you're exactly right it comes
[01:39:13.880 --> 01:39:19.560]  in an email form at least when I receive it and sometimes it's so ridiculous
[01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:23.920]  because you'll see you know we don't live in a you know hugely populated
[01:39:23.920 --> 01:39:29.520]  area it'll be someone you know and you laugh up there buying more guns but it
[01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:36.880]  has a person's address it has any prior contact they've had with police then we
[01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:41.360]  receive that and some of us objected to it and the only reason I even read them
[01:39:41.360 --> 01:39:48.600]  is just out of curiosity and out of just so I'll be informed but it's a
[01:39:48.600 --> 01:39:53.560]  surveillance file being opened on someone who is not under the suspicion
[01:39:53.560 --> 01:39:58.960]  of a crime it is pre-crime it is North Korea go ahead absolutely and then the
[01:39:58.960 --> 01:40:04.880]  other thing I wanted to touch on the huge purchase by Homeland Security and
[01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:10.440]  other federal agencies of ammunition had a lot to do with the fact that they knew
[01:40:10.440 --> 01:40:15.280]  this was coming because when you brought it up before they said well here in a
[01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:18.160]  little while you know when they're going to be able to purchase ammo and that
[01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:24.200]  does include police agencies they can't buy ammo just like people can't right
[01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:27.560]  now because there's such a shortage and you know why there's a shortage it's not
[01:40:27.560 --> 01:40:31.840]  really the gun that the ammo buying the military doesn't sell the brass anymore
[01:40:31.840 --> 01:40:36.760]  and because of all the federal purchases the police can't get it either this is
[01:40:36.760 --> 01:40:41.680]  the feds buying it all up because my Intel is it's way more than 1.6 billion
[01:40:41.680 --> 01:40:46.320]  rounds go ahead well and it's true and it's kind of sad because at the low
[01:40:46.320 --> 01:40:51.680]  levels the local police departments that that may actually you know need that for
[01:40:51.680 --> 01:40:57.600]  range training another thing they have very few rounds on hand it's a joke how
[01:40:57.600 --> 01:41:02.440]  little your local police department has they have what's on their officers duty
[01:41:02.440 --> 01:41:07.000]  belts and a few boxes per officer in a locker somewhere and that's it no
[01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:12.280]  whenever I'm at gun shops I see police they're off-duty who come over and tell
[01:41:12.280 --> 01:41:16.120]  me their police and a lot of show me their badge and say I'm here having to
[01:41:16.120 --> 01:41:20.880]  buy ammo to go to the shooting range myself because they won't even give them
[01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:27.640]  the ammo now it's true I mean most most agencies won't give you any to practice
[01:41:27.640 --> 01:41:34.120]  with they won't do some agencies you even have to buy your own duty ammo but
[01:41:34.120 --> 01:41:40.400]  I want to talk about if we have any time about how I envisioned the actual
[01:41:40.400 --> 01:41:45.320]  confiscation to take place they're smart enough to know that there's a system in
[01:41:45.320 --> 01:41:49.840]  place that will allow this to happen without some sort of grandstanding and
[01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:57.480]  going door-to-door just like in any other criminal case if you if there's
[01:41:57.480 --> 01:42:01.640]  probable cause that you have done something they'll just issue a warrant
[01:42:01.640 --> 01:42:07.120]  for you so so you get stopped you have a rifle that supposedly needs to be
[01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:11.480]  grandfathered under the new bill and it's checked for whatever reason by a
[01:42:11.480 --> 01:42:17.280]  police officer they will leave that as probable cause to search your house so
[01:42:17.280 --> 01:42:22.600]  you get arrested on a warrant you'll go to jail at a place where no one sees it
[01:42:22.600 --> 01:42:28.160]  it looks like you're any other common criminal that has warrants for for
[01:42:28.160 --> 01:42:32.880]  whatever reason there's no one to feel sorry for you and no one to take your
[01:42:32.880 --> 01:42:36.640]  side so you just disappeared and they go to your house when you're at home and
[01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:39.360]  take your guns no no that's it I don't know if you've been listening but no
[01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:42.640]  that's exactly how they plan to do it and what they're training the military
[01:42:42.640 --> 01:42:46.720]  for is they're gonna shut up gang checkpoints not sobriety checkpoints
[01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:50.760]  it's already started all over the country and in federal test grounds it's
[01:42:50.760 --> 01:42:56.880]  federal grants quietly for illegal gang checkpoints and they shut up they'll
[01:42:56.880 --> 01:43:00.240]  even have a truck with a heavy gun in the back I actually have the news here
[01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:07.320]  gang checkpoints popping up in Texas and that is out of a WO AI TV and radio out
[01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:12.920]  of San Antonio and what they do is they they just get the police used to it
[01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:16.640]  where they run a gang background they take photos of tattoos they get you out
[01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:20.200]  they search your car totally unconstitutional it's training you for
[01:43:20.200 --> 01:43:22.880]  it and then in the future it's just like the
[01:43:22.880 --> 01:43:27.120]  void cards in Illinois your things out a week they pull you over they go hey
[01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:30.520]  you're Floyd's out you still got guns yeah boom you're going to jail and
[01:43:30.520 --> 01:43:34.040]  exactly they're just gonna pick us up that way you're gonna be pulled over
[01:43:34.040 --> 01:43:38.000]  you're gonna drive into a checkpoint and they'll go we have a record here than a
[01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:42.080]  1989 because they digitized all those records that's going on now you bought a
[01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:48.520]  semi-automatic Remington such-and-such oh yeah oh you admit to it BAM felony
[01:43:48.520 --> 01:43:52.680]  you're gone you're and they're getting money in the new federal law for
[01:43:52.680 --> 01:43:57.120]  expanded federal courts for gun owners more prisons oh yeah they're gonna look
[01:43:57.120 --> 01:44:02.400]  Homeland Security the FEMA camps is for gun owners you can curb that analysis I
[01:44:02.400 --> 01:44:10.760]  agree completely and I also believe that there will be a buyback program that is
[01:44:10.760 --> 01:44:16.160]  put in place it's extremely lucrative money-wise they're probably going to pay
[01:44:16.160 --> 01:44:19.840]  more money than you could get in the market value for guns and they're
[01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:26.280]  probably going to be scaled per how effective they are for self-defense so
[01:44:26.280 --> 01:44:33.200]  the so-called assault rifles you may be able to get $2,000 and so as things get
[01:44:33.200 --> 01:44:37.440]  worse and people are hungry they'll get a lot of guns that way because people
[01:44:37.440 --> 01:44:42.600]  think I my bills are due I can go get two grand right now for this gun and
[01:44:42.600 --> 01:44:46.520]  people will do it I agree let me just stop you that's always been the plan and
[01:44:46.520 --> 01:44:49.800]  I got to go to Pastor Butch and a clip from his radio show a few nights ago but
[01:44:49.800 --> 01:44:53.920]  before we do that just briefly are the other officers around you starting to
[01:44:53.920 --> 01:44:59.800]  get what's happening yes I work in a good department above average in that
[01:44:59.800 --> 01:45:05.120]  regard we just elected a new sheriff in our county who is better than average
[01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:10.040]  perfect but I live I'm fortunate that I live and work in a place that is better
[01:45:10.040 --> 01:45:14.880]  than most but you know everybody should be freaking out right now because it's
[01:45:14.880 --> 01:45:19.640]  not just gonna be take the guns this signifies total hammer drop the end of
[01:45:19.640 --> 01:45:23.800]  America folks they plan a massive re-education takeover god bless you
[01:45:23.800 --> 01:45:26.800]  we're gonna keep pastor Butch about 10 minutes in the next hour and then get
[01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:30.240]  Bob Fletcher on this is breaking but I've got Fletcher coming on because he
[01:45:30.240 --> 01:45:33.960]  was an Iran contra whistleblower and congressional fraud investigator and he
[01:45:33.960 --> 01:45:38.840]  has seen the inside of the CIA assassinations black ops you name it
[01:45:38.840 --> 01:45:42.320]  he's been warning about this for 20 years but I want to play a clip from
[01:45:42.320 --> 01:45:47.280]  pastor butches show the full audio is up at info wars calm because people were
[01:45:47.280 --> 01:45:50.080]  asking you know is this report accurate I went well yeah but we need to tell
[01:45:50.080 --> 01:45:53.920]  people who it is it's pastor butch so that's now been added at info wars calm
[01:45:53.920 --> 01:45:59.640]  but one of his sources a lieutenant McCoy and it was butch that broke the
[01:45:59.640 --> 01:46:04.640]  clergy response team I don't know six seven years ago people couldn't believe
[01:46:04.640 --> 01:46:08.480]  it at the time it was later declassified preachers are being paid to spy on you
[01:46:08.480 --> 01:46:12.680]  and to teach to turn your guns in when they're given the order now it's over a
[01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:16.480]  hundred thousand preachers so we're gonna get butch and and and his info
[01:46:16.480 --> 01:46:20.160]  briefly here I'm probably having back on tomorrow so but but let's go to a clip
[01:46:20.160 --> 01:46:26.280]  from the lieutenant McCoy out of North Carolina totally freaked out because he
[01:46:26.280 --> 01:46:29.040]  says they're telling him it's about to happen in the next few weeks here it is

[01:50:46.760 --> 01:50:51.320]  I want to explain to the police and military something
[01:50:52.320 --> 01:50:57.280]  I am NOT going to turn my legally bought guns in just because of globalist
[01:50:57.280 --> 01:51:02.280]  criminal mafia Don says I have to but I also want it clear I because I'm an
[01:51:02.280 --> 01:51:08.760]  information person I am here to be sacrificed I am NOT because if they come
[01:51:08.760 --> 01:51:12.840]  to my house and kill me I didn't resist I'm just not turning them in they can
[01:51:12.840 --> 01:51:16.960]  I'm gonna go right to court be a national court case whatever the problem
[01:51:16.960 --> 01:51:21.600]  is they'll probably just kill me and they're gonna sip in special units in to
[01:51:21.600 --> 01:51:25.560]  just kill gun owners and they're gonna call us terrorists and then the foolish
[01:51:25.560 --> 01:51:29.840]  roid head you heard him call them roid head and droid head they're robots they
[01:51:29.840 --> 01:51:33.160]  get killed will be used as martyrs on the news and this is how America falls
[01:51:33.160 --> 01:51:38.140]  and Obama will be called the new Lincoln they've mainly got southern
[01:51:38.140 --> 01:51:42.680]  governors on the special ten governor council to sell everybody out to say oh
[01:51:42.680 --> 01:51:46.800]  look there's governors on the federal council as if that Trump's the other 40
[01:51:46.800 --> 01:51:49.920]  governors it and they're gonna take everything they're gonna take your bank
[01:51:49.920 --> 01:51:53.680]  accounts your pension funds everything they've got force compulsory national
[01:51:53.680 --> 01:51:57.680]  service and communist brigades already set up on a manual set that up I can
[01:51:57.680 --> 01:52:03.560]  play him saying it if you want me to this is how tyranny happens and they
[01:52:03.560 --> 01:52:07.200]  they don't even care if you do if you did all turn your guns and they still
[01:52:07.200 --> 01:52:10.600]  come to your house and kill you and drop guns there they've got special units
[01:52:10.600 --> 01:52:14.840]  that literally hate the American people and want this war now a lot of the
[01:52:14.840 --> 01:52:17.600]  police are good people especially Christians like you just heard that man
[01:52:17.600 --> 01:52:20.320]  and you heard him he's gonna go home and defend his family you know what that
[01:52:20.320 --> 01:52:23.800]  means once we see him killing people in the streets and everything people aren't
[01:52:23.800 --> 01:52:27.280]  gonna wait in their houses and all police that aren't part of this are
[01:52:27.280 --> 01:52:31.320]  gonna have to basically stand down they get out of that uniform real fast
[01:52:31.320 --> 01:52:36.180]  because see you're in Sauron's uniform now you're in the foreign banks uniform
[01:52:36.180 --> 01:52:44.160]  you're in Avicii French collaborator uniform and I just can't my guts I've
[01:52:44.160 --> 01:52:46.860]  told you this for months that I've just I just know it's all coming I mean I know
[01:52:46.860 --> 01:52:54.560]  I don't need to even look at all this I know my discernment is just just I mean
[01:52:54.560 --> 01:52:59.720]  I've got my self in order with God I'll tell you that right now I've made my
[01:52:59.720 --> 01:53:04.760]  peace with God let's go to Pastor Butch paw pastor I tell you this is so
[01:53:04.760 --> 01:53:08.440]  disgusting and it tears my guts out that we're gonna watch the total fall of
[01:53:08.440 --> 01:53:13.120]  America right now but I guess in a way we deserve it the 53 million abortions
[01:53:13.120 --> 01:53:17.560]  and everything else how bad is it gonna get pastor from all your other sources
[01:53:17.560 --> 01:53:21.900]  and lieutenant McCoy well it's thanks have you on day I appreciate it and the
[01:53:21.900 --> 01:53:25.400]  clip you just played he almost got to the point where he asked him how they're
[01:53:25.400 --> 01:53:29.280]  gonna bring it down he said probably through an economic collapse and we're
[01:53:29.280 --> 01:53:34.120]  watching news the news talking about the fiscal cliff and all the things and
[01:53:34.120 --> 01:53:38.500]  not the Senate and Congress is avoided and it's all a show we know it's a show
[01:53:38.500 --> 01:53:42.720]  and this gentleman along with two other sources I have two of my local service
[01:53:42.720 --> 01:53:45.720]  out of Michigan have confirmed everything he's told me and I'm sure a
[01:53:45.720 --> 01:53:50.120]  lot more that they're going economic collapse country probably first to call
[01:53:50.120 --> 01:53:55.680]  strain on that before they move in on people like maybe you and I but tonight
[01:53:55.680 --> 01:53:59.280]  on my program I'm gonna have the lieutenant McCoy on for a full hour to
[01:53:59.280 --> 01:54:03.880]  discuss this in much more detail and I would like to invite you and he on my
[01:54:03.880 --> 01:54:08.360]  show tomorrow can we do that I have to ask him I don't know that I swore
[01:54:08.360 --> 01:54:12.200]  secrets to him who he is waste from except for the state of North Carolina
[01:54:12.200 --> 01:54:16.320]  but I know I know but every time you've had these sources and confirm them it
[01:54:16.320 --> 01:54:20.840]  always later comes out as accurate but but but sure and we'll obviously play
[01:54:20.840 --> 01:54:24.720]  some excerpts tomorrow from you tonight eight o'clock central but yeah talk to

[01:54:36.560 --> 01:54:40.840]  not prophets I'm a Bible believe in I guess you can call me a Bible thumper I
[01:54:40.840 --> 01:54:44.480]  believe the Word of God's the Word of God pain no compromises no no exceptions
[01:54:44.480 --> 01:54:49.160]  but we're not prophets I just take the scriptures I take history and current
[01:54:49.160 --> 01:54:52.720]  events and I can tell you where we are in time and what we're saying we've been
[01:54:52.720 --> 01:54:56.440]  saying that for years it's coming to pass we're not prophets but we're not
[01:54:56.440 --> 01:55:00.760]  fools either we can see what's coming we're trying to warn the people they're
[01:55:00.760 --> 01:55:03.400]  starting to listen a little more than it used to before even people out here that
[01:55:03.400 --> 01:55:06.040]  for years thought I was crazy or something realize hey he's telling the
[01:55:06.040 --> 01:55:11.240]  truth all along and it just breaks my heart we can't reach everyone but they're
[01:55:11.240 --> 01:55:13.960]  one to fight now Alex that's what they're wanting they're pushing for a
[01:55:13.960 --> 01:55:17.680]  fight and they're gonna get one and I know that's the thing I hope all the
[01:55:17.680 --> 01:55:21.920]  all these Royd heads understand you're gonna get a fight yes you are and the
[01:55:21.920 --> 01:55:26.000]  globalist don't care the plan is to wipe all you idiots out but I'll tell you
[01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.880]  these Royd heads is just too stupid man I'm telling you I mean they just they
[01:55:28.880 --> 01:55:34.480]  are I've seen one wearing a shirt today and look down here in Summersville next

[01:55:40.120 --> 01:55:45.000]  the cops we're more of a man than you are something like that and I just I
[01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:48.880]  just looked at this cringe you know a few years ago he would been fired for
[01:55:48.880 --> 01:55:52.920]  wearing a shirt like that it wouldn't it wouldn't have been a question but now

[01:56:03.240 --> 01:56:07.080]  McCoy spoke with him a phone a little more in length yesterday before we
[01:56:07.080 --> 01:56:11.120]  scheduled a program tonight and he is very concerned more so than to mention
[01:56:11.120 --> 01:56:14.880]  on my radio show tonight I get more detail but he's very concerned he knows
[01:56:14.880 --> 01:56:20.480]  it's imminent according to him and other sources two to three months is a good
[01:56:20.480 --> 01:56:24.120]  shot of being a possibility this all come together now maybe they're all few
[01:56:24.120 --> 01:56:27.080]  months I don't know we're not gonna put dates on this well if we get the word
[01:56:27.080 --> 01:56:31.520]  out they'll pull back but but but yes right now they're going to DEFCON one so
[01:56:31.520 --> 01:56:34.680]  this is this is imminent we're not talking folks by something 20 years from
[01:56:34.680 --> 01:56:38.600]  now or five years from now this is imminent what is five three months six
[01:56:38.600 --> 01:56:43.320]  months or a year this is coming right now look at the timeline they're getting
[01:56:43.320 --> 01:56:46.960]  ready to pass a physical gun turn in and they're gonna say turn them in and
[01:56:46.960 --> 01:56:49.860]  they're gonna start SWAT teaming and killing people that don't as a way to
[01:56:49.860 --> 01:56:53.160]  try to terrify us and that's not gonna happen people are gonna go out and
[01:56:53.160 --> 01:56:56.940]  engage them and then it's gonna be all the gun owners are terrorists which the
[01:56:56.940 --> 01:57:01.480]  manuals already say a self-fulfilling prophecy well you know Eric Holder back
[01:57:01.480 --> 01:57:05.680]  in 95 said that we have to change their minds brainwash people to believe that
[01:57:05.680 --> 01:57:10.400]  to think different loans that's quote yes and and he did convince me of
[01:57:10.400 --> 01:57:14.400]  something I never bought a gun in my life considered a weapon I own guns I
[01:57:14.400 --> 01:57:18.600]  own several guns I always buy them for fun target practice or hunting I never
[01:57:18.600 --> 01:57:22.280]  bought a gun for a weapon per se but I'm there about a baseball bat for a weapon
[01:57:22.280 --> 01:57:26.400]  either either can be used for weapon but I have considered about guns as weapons
[01:57:26.400 --> 01:57:30.720]  now I didn't do it Eric Holder you were it worked on me you convinced me my guns
[01:57:30.720 --> 01:57:33.960]  are gonna be weapons I didn't buy them for that reason no more no more than
[01:57:33.960 --> 01:57:37.600]  about a baseball bat for that reason but you attacked me I'll defend myself my
[01:57:37.600 --> 01:57:43.440]  family by any means necessary with all the force I have now I'm a pastor I'm a
[01:57:43.440 --> 01:57:47.800]  Christian I don't want to do this I'm begging you folks leave us alone we're
[01:57:47.800 --> 01:57:52.400]  begging you don't tread on us we're not willing to fight but we will by God
[01:57:52.400 --> 01:58:00.400]  stand and fight yeah it's they really want to start a civil war and I'm telling
[01:58:00.400 --> 01:58:03.880]  you the veterans out there are just gonna wipe out the police I mean they're
[01:58:03.880 --> 01:58:08.360]  gonna be wiped out and that is the plan that is the plan to then bring in foreign
[01:58:08.360 --> 01:58:13.280]  troops I mean I mean the police will be wiped out I mean I hope they understand
[01:58:13.280 --> 01:58:17.960]  that I just cannot believe we've got to this point and at first they're gonna go
[01:58:17.960 --> 01:58:22.000]  out and blow up houses and go after cult members and demonize this is not gonna
[01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:27.680]  work and then people are gonna go on the offense defensively pastor and just
[01:58:27.680 --> 01:58:31.480]  cannot believe it and I don't worry the White House will stage some more
[01:58:31.480 --> 01:58:34.880]  shootings I can tell you that so they can go out and fake cry and say well
[01:58:34.880 --> 01:58:38.240]  they told us gun owners you killed the kids you're terrorists we'll be right

[02:01:29.360 --> 02:01:33.520]  I've never felt like this in my spirit and now we see it all unfolding yes yes
[02:01:33.520 --> 02:01:37.000]  I have nice said the same thing about same time to the power six months ago
[02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:40.280]  there's something coming my gut says it of course we know it's your spirit but
[02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:43.560]  in your gut it's like a dread it's like you're expecting to be mortared or
[02:01:43.560 --> 02:01:46.720]  rocketed like it was an army you're expecting it it's gonna happen you're
[02:01:46.720 --> 02:01:49.760]  just waiting you almost wish to get dope yeah was your spirit ever wrong was your
[02:01:49.760 --> 02:01:54.360]  gut ever wrong when you were in covert operations in Cambodia not very often
[02:01:54.360 --> 02:01:57.960]  though no not very often I've learned I've learned to trust my spirit on that
[02:01:57.960 --> 02:02:01.240]  especially since my Christian and the Holy Spirit does tell me things not very
[02:02:01.240 --> 02:02:04.720]  often though well it just meant the guy aiming a gun at you quit aiming it at
[02:02:04.720 --> 02:02:07.960]  you know when that when the when the bad thing didn't happen exactly that's what
[02:02:07.960 --> 02:02:10.800]  you know that you see you may say a minute ago that's really important if
[02:02:10.800 --> 02:02:14.760]  we get this news out we may delay this for a few months but Alice is going to
[02:02:14.760 --> 02:02:18.960]  come you mean you remember of course William Cooper when Cooper wrote a book
[02:02:18.960 --> 02:02:22.320]  entitled behold a pale horse and in that book he said and he gave the name of the
[02:02:22.320 --> 02:02:26.880]  CIA operation that was gonna do this that would cause shooting and mass
[02:02:26.880 --> 02:02:31.440]  killings in schools that's in his book in 1991 so my website pastor much calm
[02:02:31.440 --> 02:02:37.120]  read it for yourself it's on there this was predicted 13 years ago 12 years ago

[02:02:42.160 --> 02:02:47.000]  absolutely phenomenal again he wasn't a prophet but he knew I was coming down of
[02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:50.880]  course he was killed for it but he spoke the truth put it in his book and now
[02:02:50.880 --> 02:02:54.280]  we're seeing it happen and most people don't even know what was in the book
[02:02:54.280 --> 02:02:57.160]  because in the most I never read it if they did they forgot about it but then

[02:09:27.520 --> 02:09:31.840]  okay I've said there's a danger of this a danger of that it's because we've been
[02:09:31.840 --> 02:09:36.200]  winning the gun culture has been taking over abortions now unpopular in polls
[02:09:36.200 --> 02:09:40.960]  people are cutting back on abortions they know we're winning so they come out
[02:09:40.960 --> 02:09:45.600]  put Obama back in run a political corpse against him and then say it's a mandate
[02:09:45.600 --> 02:09:50.920]  for tyranny this is their attempt to act confident and do all this and then try
[02:09:50.920 --> 02:09:54.800]  to cause a civil war so Obama can play the part of Lincoln they know it's gonna
[02:09:54.800 --> 02:09:59.460]  be a storm they know it's gonna be a giant shooting war they're ready they're
[02:09:59.460 --> 02:10:03.480]  dug in that's why they've hardened all the police departments police out there
[02:10:03.480 --> 02:10:06.640]  you're smart enough to see all the preparations that are bigger than Obama
[02:10:06.640 --> 02:10:13.040]  this is a long-term program Obama is just the front man for this and now
[02:10:13.040 --> 02:10:19.520]  they're admitting it Illinois's introduced bills with their head head
[02:10:19.520 --> 02:10:26.360]  leader there to openly ban the guns to make you turn in all the newly
[02:10:26.360 --> 02:10:31.920]  manufactured firearms that's up at infowars.com banning shooting ranges
[02:10:31.920 --> 02:10:36.720]  cop-site gangs the justification for unconstitutional checkpoints where
[02:10:36.720 --> 02:10:39.320]  they're pulling a lot of their cars and photographing us all over the country
[02:10:39.320 --> 02:10:43.520]  but centered in Texas Illinois's moves to outlaw modern firearms and
[02:10:43.520 --> 02:10:47.660]  criminalized owners Obama would call on military to disarm Americans during
[02:10:47.660 --> 02:10:52.320]  national emergency and we just talked and played a police lieutenant with GCN
[02:10:52.320 --> 02:10:56.320]  host pastor Butch Paul who has he makes them give him driver's license and stuff
[02:10:56.320 --> 02:10:59.600]  there's a lot of times I end up getting guessed on that he gets because he he
[02:10:59.600 --> 02:11:02.720]  gets these sources and he gets proof of who they are he did that with the
[02:11:02.720 --> 02:11:06.720]  clergy response team seven eight years ago I don't know like it was like seven
[02:11:06.720 --> 02:11:11.000]  years ago two years before he moves us but seven years ago he got the guy's
[02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:14.520]  names I got their names after got him on the show they were training preachers
[02:11:14.520 --> 02:11:18.720]  for during martial law to tell folks to submit now I can play newscast saying
[02:11:18.720 --> 02:11:22.520]  that the during martial law preachers will help tell the public to turn their
[02:11:22.520 --> 02:11:25.720]  guns in just type in clergy response team into YouTube you'll see the
[02:11:25.720 --> 02:11:30.720]  newscast that was like five years after he broke it and he has a police
[02:11:30.720 --> 02:11:37.840]  lieutenant freaked out enough to come on and even use this last name on air from
[02:11:37.840 --> 02:11:43.040]  North Carolina and say in the next week they start the training with the ATF to
[02:11:43.040 --> 02:11:47.560]  federalize the local police we're gonna have checkpoints and arrest everybody
[02:11:47.560 --> 02:11:53.440]  that doesn't turn their guns in now part of that's a shy op to see what police
[02:11:53.440 --> 02:11:57.080]  say no so they can create their criminal brigades of guys that'll say yes and
[02:11:57.080 --> 02:12:02.200]  it's part of scaring all of us look I'm not turning my legal guns and I've never
[02:12:02.200 --> 02:12:05.000]  committed a crime with them I'm not gonna live like places where they've
[02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:08.080]  taken all the guns everybody lives in fear and families get raped and killed
[02:12:08.080 --> 02:12:11.400]  and they only use gun laws against law-abiding citizens in England if
[02:12:11.400 --> 02:12:15.920]  somebody defends themselves with their fists they throw the book at them I know
[02:12:15.920 --> 02:12:19.960]  your criminals I know who you are I'm a talk show host and I'm not turning crud

[02:13:36.080 --> 02:13:41.720]  I don't want this to happen okay believe me I'm a successful syndicated radio
[02:13:41.720 --> 02:13:46.040]  talk show host who's been in big Hollywood movies and you know gotten to

[02:13:57.440 --> 02:14:02.760]  through your head and I'm and I've never turned tail and run there's nowhere to
[02:14:02.760 --> 02:14:06.840]  run you know they say there's fight or flight
[02:14:06.840 --> 02:14:14.760]  I fight okay I fight I'm gonna fight and I'm fighting with the info war right now
[02:14:14.760 --> 02:14:18.200]  these are murdering criminals the evidence is they staged Sandy Hook I
[02:14:18.200 --> 02:14:21.920]  want to go to Bob Fletcher I appreciate him coming on today we had a lot of
[02:14:21.920 --> 02:14:25.120]  breaking news I wanted to get him on because he was a congressional
[02:14:25.120 --> 02:14:29.600]  whistleblower an advisor and you know on TV and things during the Iran-Contra
[02:14:29.600 --> 02:14:35.280]  affair he owned a big successful importation export business with toys
[02:14:35.280 --> 02:14:40.640]  and the CIA came without him knowing and said hey let's do business together and
[02:14:40.640 --> 02:14:44.120]  it turned out it was all of operation with generals coming to his toy factory
[02:14:44.120 --> 02:14:48.920]  and using it as a front and and and narcotics trafficking and all the rest
[02:14:48.920 --> 02:14:51.400]  of it he refused to be part of it they tried to destroy they also tried to
[02:14:51.400 --> 02:14:58.280]  assassinate him I mean it's just amazing and he's businessman investigator film
[02:14:58.280 --> 02:15:03.200]  producer speaker and author Bob Fletcher investigations calm and Bob they've been
[02:15:03.200 --> 02:15:07.280]  planning this for a long time it backed off because we were winning because
[02:15:07.280 --> 02:15:10.920]  people are waking up they had Brzezinski admits they're seven to twelve years
[02:15:10.920 --> 02:15:14.360]  behind and putting on which actuary now they're saying because they're in so
[02:15:14.360 --> 02:15:18.120]  much trouble they're gonna try to accelerate the whole program and they've
[02:15:18.120 --> 02:15:24.640]  decided that a civil war will be what brings them into full power that's that's
[02:15:24.640 --> 02:15:28.240]  not my what I'm saying they're now saying he is Lincoln there will be a
[02:15:28.240 --> 02:15:33.160]  civil war he is our God he will crush the states I saw that four years ago
[02:15:33.160 --> 02:15:36.360]  with him saying he was Lincoln I said I think that's what's gonna happen and
[02:15:36.360 --> 02:15:40.880]  that is what's happened now hopefully cooler minds will prevail and they won't
[02:15:40.880 --> 02:15:46.360]  try this but Bob what is your take on everything that's unfolding right now
[02:15:46.360 --> 02:15:54.080]  well first off some miscellaneous random notes that I made for myself for this
[02:15:54.080 --> 02:16:01.160]  morning's program just hit right right on the head exactly what you've been
[02:16:01.160 --> 02:16:04.560]  saying I mean it looks like you've been looking at my nose it's kind of like
[02:16:04.560 --> 02:16:08.440]  well I don't have to do anything cuz cuz Alec has already covered it I mean
[02:16:08.440 --> 02:16:16.400]  verbatim almost word-to-word you you I'm gonna I'm making this assumption you
[02:16:16.400 --> 02:16:23.760]  realize that I myself was one of the primary people in creating what was the
[02:16:23.760 --> 02:16:30.880]  malicious you are the guy and not certainly not taking all the credit
[02:16:30.880 --> 02:16:33.640]  because there's a lot of people involved people need to know that you know what
[02:16:33.640 --> 02:16:40.480]  you're talking about I was doing speaking engagements and what have you
[02:16:40.480 --> 02:16:47.320]  after my crazy situation that you just mentioned being sucked into the middle
[02:16:47.320 --> 02:16:53.760]  of major major governmental corruption you know with illegal arms and drugs
[02:16:53.760 --> 02:16:57.760]  connected to it and all the rest of that stuff which was turned out to be the
[02:16:57.760 --> 02:17:02.320]  Iran contra mess but not just that they were all over the world with the same
[02:17:02.320 --> 02:17:07.640]  people that I was dealing with you know so so what happened was it pro created
[02:17:07.640 --> 02:17:12.360]  itself I ended up being drawn back in over and over and over again every time
[02:17:12.360 --> 02:17:17.480]  for the every like in two years cycles when they had another crazy corrupted
[02:17:17.480 --> 02:17:22.680]  thing up there it was something that crossed my my path so I got dragged back
[02:17:22.680 --> 02:17:27.000]  up into being involved with different senators and congressmen a couple of
[02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:33.400]  them were good and most of them were crooked lying guys but the situation
[02:17:33.400 --> 02:17:41.200]  what had taken place when when we surged with with the and the word militia is
[02:17:41.200 --> 02:17:45.640]  what scared the pudding out of everybody obviously you know that was something
[02:17:45.640 --> 02:17:51.680]  United States never had they never had what appeared to be the word just
[02:17:51.680 --> 02:17:57.160]  constitutes kind of a military connotation so no it had never been used
[02:17:57.160 --> 02:18:02.200]  you know if we call ourselves United Patriots of America we wouldn't have
[02:18:02.200 --> 02:18:07.320]  drawn very much attention but when we started calling it a militia movement a
[02:18:07.320 --> 02:18:13.040]  patriot militia movement you know they went crazy in Washington they we really
[02:18:13.040 --> 02:18:18.800]  scared them to death there for a while and and that was and and that the 10 or
[02:18:18.800 --> 02:18:24.840]  12 years behind in terms of the New World Order's concept and their ideas of
[02:18:24.840 --> 02:18:31.080]  taking our guns and moving into a full one-world government that 10 to 12 years
[02:18:31.080 --> 02:18:37.520]  slow down a lot of that had to do with that militia patriot movement because
[02:18:37.520 --> 02:18:42.880]  they really had to back off because they were openly saying Feinstein was saying
[02:18:42.880 --> 02:18:46.200]  we're gonna take all your guns world government is here we're gonna make you
[02:18:46.200 --> 02:18:50.240]  take shots and all these veterans said we're gonna fight back and they went oh
[02:18:50.240 --> 02:18:53.720]  we're not gonna make you take shots or take your guns you're paranoid so they
[02:18:53.720 --> 02:18:57.240]  went for a while with denying it now they're just trying to force it all
[02:18:57.240 --> 02:19:02.240]  three right now but there's something else it has come up I think and and I
[02:19:02.240 --> 02:19:06.160]  think and it's not you know you're not missing it but a lot of people are kind
[02:19:06.160 --> 02:19:12.000]  of missing it and I don't know that I mentioned it earlier one of my other
[02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:18.800]  appearances with you I'm trying to accomplish and finish up this this last
[02:19:18.800 --> 02:19:24.560]  video I'm putting together which is a presentation that I think sort of and
[02:19:24.560 --> 02:19:29.240]  some of it even gets extremely way kind of out in left field but unfortunately
[02:19:29.240 --> 02:19:34.920]  I'm afraid that it all sort of fits together and but what's going on there's
[02:19:34.920 --> 02:19:41.560]  there's something else out there that has caused the bad guys the New World
[02:19:41.560 --> 02:19:46.840]  Order proponents in all it has caused them to change a lot of directions speed
[02:19:46.840 --> 02:19:52.680]  up some things bypass some other things and then put some of their old concepts
[02:19:52.680 --> 02:19:56.920]  on the shelf and move with this okay I want to break down what you think's
[02:19:56.920 --> 02:20:02.360]  changed in the matrix when we get back with Bob Fleischer weekend by GMO

[02:24:19.020 --> 02:24:22.840]  gonna vote for it they don't care about you anymore because election fraud is
[02:24:22.840 --> 02:24:28.240]  almost total they're announcing that they're just going to massively raise
[02:24:28.240 --> 02:24:32.640]  taxes on 77% of households they have Club of Obama swearing you never do
[02:24:32.640 --> 02:24:38.840]  that it's all about betrayal for every $41 in tax increases there's $1 in cuts
[02:24:38.840 --> 02:24:43.480]  and that's all fake ever this is a program they've done in other countries
[02:24:43.480 --> 02:24:47.040]  now Bob Fletcher we were just talking former congressional whistleblower
[02:24:47.040 --> 02:24:53.040]  insider I ran contra whistleblower who's right in the middle of it that's what
[02:24:53.040 --> 02:24:55.720]  they do when they come recruit people this comes out all the time they just
[02:24:55.720 --> 02:25:00.320]  force businessmen into it or they come and say they're a company suddenly
[02:25:00.320 --> 02:25:03.520]  you're in contracts with them and they go by the way we're firing banks or
[02:25:03.520 --> 02:25:07.400]  we're the CIA and we'll kill you even if you don't do what we say I mean it's
[02:25:07.400 --> 02:25:11.960]  just it's mafia I mean that's all it is is mafia but it's US government national
[02:25:11.960 --> 02:25:17.240]  security and why do they want the guns now you were saying that they're behind
[02:25:17.240 --> 02:25:22.280]  schedule you were concurring that yeah they want to start some kind of crises
[02:25:22.280 --> 02:25:27.600]  but but why now are they just not caring what we think what's the plan
[02:25:27.600 --> 02:25:34.800]  well of course the big problem now is you know that we've we as in everybody
[02:25:34.800 --> 02:25:39.920]  except those of us who are have been in in the front of this thing for so long
[02:25:39.920 --> 02:25:44.080]  you know we've permitted them to do it we've let them get away with it it goes
[02:25:44.080 --> 02:25:48.040]  back and you know unfortunately on my grandfather's shoulders and then on my
[02:25:48.040 --> 02:25:52.280]  father's shoulders and then on my shoulders you know and the the bottom
[02:25:52.280 --> 02:25:58.360]  line is they have successfully gotten away this situation where I mean
[02:25:58.360 --> 02:26:03.560]  anything that they want to do criminally whatever it is whether it's financial or
[02:26:03.560 --> 02:26:10.320]  or something else maybe just political even whatever they decide to do they
[02:26:10.320 --> 02:26:15.640]  just do it which includes killing people that may be gonna come forward and talk
[02:26:15.640 --> 02:26:19.320]  and I'm not gonna get into that but dying core runs child kidnapping
[02:26:19.320 --> 02:26:23.960]  publicly doesn't get in trouble once in the news open insider trading I mean
[02:26:23.960 --> 02:26:28.680]  they are absolute murdering criminals and the way they get away with it if you
[02:26:28.680 --> 02:26:35.680]  can imagine Al Capone if he had the ability to stamp top secret or covert
[02:26:35.680 --> 02:26:40.680]  operations or classified if he had that big rubber stamp that those guys in
[02:26:40.680 --> 02:26:46.680]  Washington have and could just stamp one of his his bank robbery deals and just
[02:26:46.680 --> 02:26:52.880]  say oh you can't interview those people because it is linked to a very important
[02:26:52.880 --> 02:26:58.640]  a government project I'm sorry so then you know put away your lawyers and put
[02:26:58.640 --> 02:27:02.720]  away that you judicial system oh when it came out on the Sandusky thing with the
[02:27:02.720 --> 02:27:06.400]  heads of the university involved they all made them honorary NSA members so
[02:27:06.400 --> 02:27:10.720]  they can't get in trouble no I mean it's unbelievable but so they have
[02:27:10.720 --> 02:27:15.880]  successfully gotten away with that then they as you you mentioned and we all
[02:27:15.880 --> 02:27:20.120]  aware now you know they've been stockpiling bullets I mean they're
[02:27:20.120 --> 02:27:24.400]  buying up bullets and putting in orders for bullets and weapons you know that
[02:27:24.400 --> 02:27:30.720]  would just fill battleships what in the world are miscellaneous bureaucratic
[02:27:30.720 --> 02:27:37.360]  small-level bureaucratic operations doing ordering up ten and a half million
[02:27:37.360 --> 02:27:42.680]  I talked to a police officer where one company of National Guard for Urban
[02:27:42.680 --> 02:27:47.100]  Warfare had three million rounds of bullets there on the small base can you
[02:27:47.100 --> 02:27:52.860]  imagine and so what are we doing about it Chris unfortunately at this point in
[02:27:52.860 --> 02:27:56.640]  time I never thought I was gonna get to the point where I would say this you
[02:27:56.640 --> 02:28:03.400]  know they they got us they got us by the butt they've got a hold of us I mean we
[02:28:03.400 --> 02:28:08.720]  you know I mean I have all the people that were involved originally with the
[02:28:08.720 --> 02:28:14.880]  1990s Patriot movement they so many of them a lot of them have actually been
[02:28:14.880 --> 02:28:21.200]  put in jail as some I think are still in jail random things that they brought in
[02:28:21.200 --> 02:28:28.600]  you know set people up and all that kind of stuff so it's really really reached a
[02:28:28.600 --> 02:28:33.960]  point of it's where it genuinely is going to hit the fan now I don't know I
[02:28:33.960 --> 02:28:38.200]  have a lot of people have a different opinion of this some some folks feel
[02:28:38.200 --> 02:28:43.680]  that it's totally and strictly a financial collapse situation where
[02:28:43.680 --> 02:28:50.320]  they're totally preparing for it to the extent like we know very you know that
[02:28:50.320 --> 02:28:55.520]  upsets me a little bit is a five hundred thousand coffins pre-manufactured
[02:28:55.520 --> 02:29:00.180]  sitting out there in in it outside of Atlanta Georgia I don't know where they
[02:29:00.180 --> 02:29:06.320]  are now they moved them but the the point is when when when the people who
[02:29:06.320 --> 02:29:12.120]  are the theoretical enforcers have gone and ordered five hundred thousand
[02:29:12.120 --> 02:29:15.800]  coffin boxes it by the way could probably handle a two to three or four
[02:29:15.800 --> 02:29:22.680]  people in an emergency situation that should scare the pudding out of the
[02:29:22.680 --> 02:29:27.720]  average American but they seem to not you know nobody's out there I haven't
[02:29:27.720 --> 02:29:33.360]  seen any signs asking by the way we talked about we talked about a purge
[02:29:33.360 --> 02:29:37.380]  during the break because I agree with you I was asking what you think this is
[02:29:37.380 --> 02:29:41.200]  all about you were saying well so it's an excuse to selectively enforce on gun
[02:29:41.200 --> 02:29:44.520]  owners they're gonna make us the new enemy and I concur with you even though

[02:33:31.240 --> 02:33:35.520]  officers that can confirm what the police officer that pastor butch pause
[02:33:35.520 --> 02:33:40.920]  confirmed his identity in North Carolina said federalizing police for ATF or gun
[02:33:40.920 --> 02:33:44.760]  confiscation training door-to-door highway checkpoints now I have the news
[02:33:44.760 --> 02:33:48.840]  saying we're training the army for that and they're saying they may confiscate
[02:33:48.840 --> 02:33:52.440]  our guns it's official Illinois saying they're gonna ban almost all guns like
[02:33:52.440 --> 02:33:56.280]  Chicago make you turn a man that bill's been introduced by the head of the
[02:33:56.280 --> 02:34:02.400]  legislature that story's up at info wars calm but I want to just specifically for
[02:34:02.400 --> 02:34:06.400]  police officers who are being told the same thing as you heard butch a
[02:34:06.400 --> 02:34:11.120]  lieutenant governor and I can guess which state I know which state he knows
[02:34:11.120 --> 02:34:14.700]  the governor and the lieutenant governor but I'm not gonna say this country so
[02:34:14.700 --> 02:34:19.880]  cowardly now folks that even the heroes do it behind the scenes and the police
[02:34:19.880 --> 02:34:24.360]  you know he talked to two in Michigan confirm their identities and then the
[02:34:24.360 --> 02:34:27.920]  guy in North Carolina and then a lieutenant governor well I already know
[02:34:27.920 --> 02:34:32.680]  I mean I've got articles speak of the devil out of the Carolinas out of North
[02:34:32.680 --> 02:34:41.480]  Carolina it's in my film police state to the takeover from when is it
[02:34:41.480 --> 02:34:46.320]  2000 where they had in the schools deputized local sheriff's under ATF in
[02:34:46.320 --> 02:34:51.120]  the law enforcement program and it said they did anti-gun programs with the kids
[02:34:51.120 --> 02:34:54.600]  for a full semester and and discuss their home life that's part of the grant
[02:34:54.600 --> 02:34:59.580]  actually show the grant papers so I can confirm all of this is going on it's
[02:34:59.580 --> 02:35:06.880]  just good to hear police call in so the public can hear it so 800 to 5 9 92 31
[02:35:06.880 --> 02:35:14.960]  800 to 5 9 92 31 800 to 5 9 9 2 3 1 we're going back to Bob Fletcher here in
[02:35:14.960 --> 02:35:18.680]  just a moment hey the new magazines are in and I saw somebody on YouTube
[02:35:18.680 --> 02:35:25.760]  complaining going why is it $59 for 12 issues and complaining that we're
[02:35:25.760 --> 02:35:30.000]  charging money these are big color glossy thick magazines now we've
[02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:35.360]  expanded them now into the fifth issue and that includes the 12 shipping it's
[02:35:35.360 --> 02:35:41.000]  over $2 per magazine after shipping handling graphics writers I'll be honest
[02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:45.120]  with you and I designed it this way this thing is not making money but it is
[02:35:45.120 --> 02:35:49.760]  getting the word out okay and it will soon we got enough subscribers but we
[02:35:49.760 --> 02:35:52.960]  have to make money to be able to get more info about I did it so there's hard
[02:35:52.960 --> 02:35:57.120]  copies big glossy color things you can give people full of graphics and
[02:35:57.120 --> 02:36:03.720]  editorial cartoons and everything to give people 2013 the year America dies
[02:36:03.720 --> 02:36:10.560]  okay you can buy them in bulk at cost what 10 of them for $14 a hundred it's
[02:36:10.560 --> 02:36:15.840]  even less per copy okay you can buy these at cost in bulk and give them to
[02:36:15.840 --> 02:36:21.040]  people and in fall war store calm but it's designed to wake people up and boy
[02:36:21.040 --> 02:36:25.400]  is it we put a bunch of them out for free on the streets of Austin so again
[02:36:25.400 --> 02:36:30.560]  ladies and gentlemen get it get it out to people now because here's the problem
[02:36:30.560 --> 02:36:38.080]  people don't know what's going on the media is being very quiet they're like
[02:36:38.080 --> 02:36:42.760]  yeah it's reasonable you're gonna turn your guns in with the bill or yeah we're
[02:36:42.760 --> 02:36:46.880]  gonna ban all the guns in Illinois or yeah we did build some FEMA camps there
[02:36:46.880 --> 02:36:53.160]  the average mainline neocon show is not saying anything when the Republicans
[02:36:53.160 --> 02:36:58.480]  pass the biggest you know tax increases ever and taxes on 77% of people let's
[02:36:58.480 --> 02:37:03.880]  call conservative and and and total lies and the point is they're moving this is
[02:37:03.880 --> 02:37:10.120]  it the political whoredom has been threatened controlled fluffed whatever
[02:37:10.120 --> 02:37:16.160]  the issue is into going along with this so they've been told we're making the
[02:37:16.160 --> 02:37:20.520]  move you want to have a seat at the table sit down and shut up so we have
[02:37:20.520 --> 02:37:29.200]  got to lunge to our feet because this is a 50 alarm fire no neocon show is even
[02:37:29.200 --> 02:37:33.560]  making a big deal out of this the only big media outlet not controlled by
[02:37:33.560 --> 02:37:38.360]  globalist that's covering it other than info wars calm and world net daily calm
[02:37:38.360 --> 02:37:44.240]  is drudge report calm okay so a lot of people are like I'll just shoot them
[02:37:44.240 --> 02:37:47.320]  when they come for them they're gonna pull you over to checkpoint and arrest
[02:37:47.320 --> 02:37:53.080]  you and say we know that you've got guns okay this is a way to purge the gun
[02:37:53.080 --> 02:37:58.000]  owners so eight hundred two five nine nine two three one we'll do a little bit
[02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:02.520]  of overdrive with Bob Fletcher whistleblower joining us Bob tell me
[02:38:02.520 --> 02:38:04.720]  what you said off air because you weren't listening today and you said
[02:38:04.720 --> 02:38:08.400]  your notes concurs he won't repeat it cuz I already said it read what's on
[02:38:08.400 --> 02:38:13.160]  those notes about you believing this is a plan to carry out a purge of course it
[02:38:13.160 --> 02:38:17.960]  is this is the cover for them to say we're terrorists they're already saying
[02:38:17.960 --> 02:38:22.120]  gun owners killed the kids gun owners are clan well you know the left is
[02:38:22.120 --> 02:38:25.520]  saying we hope you don't turn them in we're gonna hunt you down we're gonna
[02:38:25.520 --> 02:38:30.200]  form federal militias this is their little Soviet takeover just once they
[02:38:30.200 --> 02:38:37.280]  once they do martial law whatever pretext they utilize for that you know
[02:38:37.280 --> 02:38:42.080]  they have expanded and particularly even Obama in the last couple of years they
[02:38:42.080 --> 02:38:48.440]  have expanded the the martial law capabilities they've upgraded them they've
[02:38:48.440 --> 02:38:53.060]  upset not that it makes any difference because once martial law is in you know
[02:38:53.060 --> 02:38:57.760]  it's it's all over I mean they it gives some carte blanche to do whatever they
[02:38:57.760 --> 02:39:03.720]  want and to utilize any means by necessary they of course make reference
[02:39:03.720 --> 02:39:08.240]  I know you've covered all this and make reference to the American people as being
[02:39:08.240 --> 02:39:13.880]  a you know like it's a chattel product or something like that they call us I
[02:39:13.880 --> 02:39:19.000]  think I have a clip in a UN video from the 70s they call us human resources to
[02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:25.320]  be used and in the US code we're called animals I mean even the new the brand
[02:39:25.320 --> 02:39:30.000]  new upgraded thing that Obama died on have the papers in front of me but the
[02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:37.440]  upgrade on the recent upgrade that Obama did in the last few months actually uses
[02:39:37.440 --> 02:39:40.840]  that same term so they haven't backed off or anything they're still just using
[02:39:40.840 --> 02:39:46.800]  that terminology that you're strictly a an item to be applied to whatever they
[02:39:46.800 --> 02:39:51.560]  have to and they can force you to do whatever they want you to do and that's
[02:39:51.560 --> 02:39:56.800]  very very clear very specific in the brand new executive orders related to
[02:39:56.800 --> 02:40:02.920]  martial law no no it says forced labor it says forced work brigades they can
[02:40:02.920 --> 02:40:07.440]  take your resources Congress is suspended under these executive orders
[02:40:07.440 --> 02:40:11.960]  of Bush and Obama oh absolutely that's a done deal yeah all of that anything that
[02:40:11.960 --> 02:40:16.520]  falls into quote unquote representative government Congress passed a law saying
[02:40:16.520 --> 02:40:20.080]  they're allowed to insider trade but the media said the law banned insider
[02:40:20.080 --> 02:40:25.520]  trading when there was already a law banning it see how they work I mean
[02:40:25.520 --> 02:40:30.520]  nothing to do with what those guys are going to follow up there anyhow but
[02:40:30.520 --> 02:40:35.360]  again and I don't mean to be repetitious but the the thing that bothers me for
[02:40:35.360 --> 02:40:44.040]  example is this huge multinational mercenary operation originally called
[02:40:44.040 --> 02:40:50.760]  Blackwater now it's got to be so gigantic with multi-billion dollar on
[02:40:50.760 --> 02:40:57.000]  challenge contracts with Uncle Sam XE yeah they're so without even being
[02:40:57.000 --> 02:41:00.880]  bidded they're not bid deals for most of them they're training the police
[02:41:00.880 --> 02:41:07.880]  everywhere there's video of them on DEA raids now and when when they when they
[02:41:07.880 --> 02:41:13.000]  get around to kicking the doors and see you'll have like two mercenaries from
[02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:19.680]  who knows Afghanistan or Uganda out at your front door with one local police
[02:41:19.680 --> 02:41:23.880]  officer so that you did so that those two guys don't know it's worse than that
[02:41:23.880 --> 02:41:27.760]  correction Corps of America is now running the public schools in many
[02:41:27.760 --> 02:41:32.400]  cities and in many states and they train the kids literally to how to go into the
[02:41:32.400 --> 02:41:36.120]  private prison which is the new slave labor correction Corps of America is now
[02:41:36.120 --> 02:41:41.480]  in the elementary schools in places like Arizona when they when they go in I mean
[02:41:41.480 --> 02:41:44.680]  when once they do the martial law and then they just tell everybody alright
[02:41:44.680 --> 02:41:49.120]  we want you all to just turn in we're gonna have dump trucks coming down the
[02:41:49.120 --> 02:41:53.200]  street we want you to throw your guns in them and by the way if people think that
[02:41:53.200 --> 02:41:58.320]  sounds bizarre you know we forget even myself and maybe yourself you know we
[02:41:58.320 --> 02:42:03.400]  forget that they did that in Australia already you know they they took all the
[02:42:03.400 --> 02:42:07.440]  guns in England and they killed crocodile Dundee the real guy oh it's a
[02:42:07.440 --> 02:42:11.880]  long time it's a long time ago now they killed 2,000 Aussies they murdered him
[02:42:11.880 --> 02:42:16.080]  yep and they went in and they literally I know we actually had a printed on a
[02:42:16.080 --> 02:42:21.760]  t-shirt that the militia groups had for distribution and it was a t-shirt that
[02:42:21.760 --> 02:42:27.880]  showed a pile that was a hundred feet high and 70 feet across with nothing but
[02:42:27.880 --> 02:42:32.680]  weapons that they had confiscated and their crime rate went up 86% within two
[02:42:32.680 --> 02:42:36.160]  years and has only climbed since and now they're under carbon taxes and they
[02:42:36.160 --> 02:42:39.840]  brought in foreign gangs to literally beat and rape the Aussies who are thrown
[02:42:39.840 --> 02:42:42.920]  in prison or they defend themselves and now they're trying to ban butcher knives
[02:42:42.920 --> 02:43:00.520]  in England people think you know when people hear us talking like this I know
[02:43:00.520 --> 02:43:04.440]  there's a good percentage still out there that says well they couldn't keep
[02:43:04.440 --> 02:43:10.040]  this plan secret how could they do how could they keep this secret in that
[02:43:10.040 --> 02:43:14.480]  secret and everything but the American people have forgotten a thing called the
[02:43:14.480 --> 02:43:21.120]  Manhattan Project all right we for five years in the United States at the high
[02:43:21.120 --> 02:43:26.120]  point of national concerns that there had ever been there for a while back in
[02:43:26.120 --> 02:43:34.560]  1938-39 for five years we worked secretly to create the atomic bomb nobody
[02:43:34.560 --> 02:43:39.480]  knew anything about it I don't know how big of a secret you could get because we
[02:43:39.480 --> 02:43:44.600]  had thousands of people working on that all right but they were still able to
[02:43:44.600 --> 02:43:50.480]  keep it under wraps until boom all of a sudden one day Truman came on and said
[02:43:50.480 --> 02:43:56.840]  we just killed 150,000 Japanese people in about four and a half seconds with a
[02:43:56.840 --> 02:44:03.000]  new weapon and nobody knew anything about it and I'm afraid we're gonna be
[02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:07.440]  caught and interrupt you and interrupt you will go into overdrive we got Joe
[02:44:07.440 --> 02:44:10.040]  Bannister calling in a bunch of other police officers calling them we're gonna
[02:44:10.040 --> 02:44:14.020]  get to them right now this is breaking news they're not actually keeping the
[02:44:14.020 --> 02:44:19.160]  secret it's in the executive orders it's in the military training manuals it's in
[02:44:19.160 --> 02:44:24.600]  pieces of news here and there it's just not all being fanfared and announced so
[02:44:24.600 --> 02:44:28.280]  when they drop the hammer they're like it's like they said they ordered the
[02:44:28.280 --> 02:44:31.600]  body scanners on Christmas Day with the underwear bomber they ordered them a
[02:44:31.600 --> 02:44:35.600]  year before but they lied they just tell the public oh the Army's here to take
[02:44:35.600 --> 02:44:41.040]  your guns we just trained to do this today it's amazing Bob Fletcher ran
[02:44:41.040 --> 02:44:45.120]  contra whistleblower is our guest right now he says he's Joe Bannister I'll
[02:44:45.120 --> 02:44:49.320]  recognize his voice if it is I'm gonna go to Jeff who's a New York police officer
[02:44:49.320 --> 02:44:54.560]  and Joe who's a California police officer and Roman who's a marine but
[02:44:54.560 --> 02:44:59.880]  again I specifically want to know about people that know about the lieutenant
[02:44:59.880 --> 02:45:05.520]  McCoy that's been confirmed by our own GCN host butch paw that that the North
[02:45:05.520 --> 02:45:09.280]  Carolina they are training for mass gun confiscation door-to-door and
[02:45:09.280 --> 02:45:14.240]  checkpoints the training starts next week with special deputized units under
[02:45:14.240 --> 02:45:17.720]  ATF of local police which is the model in which I've already confirmed they're
[02:45:17.720 --> 02:45:22.720]  doing with ATF but the training is nonspecific let's talk to Joe Bannister
[02:45:22.720 --> 02:45:30.360]  Joe is this Joe Bannister hey that's you okay so you're the Treasury agent the
[02:45:30.360 --> 02:45:35.280]  sound of the IRS that found out the IRS was a scam asked him to respond so they
[02:45:35.280 --> 02:45:38.140]  told you resign and they tried to put you in prison for your free speech you
[02:45:38.140 --> 02:45:42.040]  beat them real fast what's your take on this do you have any Intel on the
[02:45:42.040 --> 02:45:46.400]  federalization covertly for gun confiscation absolutely do have a
[02:45:46.400 --> 02:45:51.640]  reliable law enforcement source who told me he personally participated in
[02:45:51.640 --> 02:45:56.880]  training within the last year it was federally funded and sponsored in which
[02:45:56.880 --> 02:46:01.400]  the officers the California peace officers were instructed to shoot to
[02:46:01.400 --> 02:46:06.360]  kill as opposed to shoot to stop and you know law enforcement won't understand
[02:46:06.360 --> 02:46:11.000]  the difference and so the federally these federal agents and federal
[02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:15.880]  military were teaching them shoot to kill and the officers were really taken
[02:46:15.880 --> 02:46:20.200]  aback by that because all of their previous training is about shoot to stop
[02:46:20.200 --> 02:46:25.440]  the threat and that's different from shoot kill so this is these that's what
[02:46:25.440 --> 02:46:29.640]  the feds are training the state and local officers at least in California
[02:46:29.640 --> 02:46:34.600]  you know that it's nationwide it's shoot to kill so I would say that totally
[02:46:34.600 --> 02:46:39.360]  corroborates what your other guests are talking about and that specifically we
[02:46:39.360 --> 02:46:43.200]  have the army manual are they trying to shoot to kill Americans who don't turn
[02:46:43.200 --> 02:46:46.960]  their guns in and including blowing up the houses what are they being told to
[02:46:46.960 --> 02:46:52.640]  shoot to kill training is for they're not told in other words they have this
[02:46:52.640 --> 02:46:55.960]  live-fire training you know where you going well they even had that with the
[02:46:55.960 --> 02:47:00.560]  police and the military quote simulating killing zombies dressed up you know in
[02:47:00.560 --> 02:47:05.040]  Dallas Cowboys jerseys that's the cover you saw that where they are having army
[02:47:05.040 --> 02:47:10.240]  training to kill zombies which is really just mow down citizen training right so
[02:47:10.240 --> 02:47:13.200]  they're not they're not actually putting like John Deere hats on the people but
[02:47:13.200 --> 02:47:18.280]  they are changing their whole outlook in terms of when they're gonna fire it's
[02:47:18.280 --> 02:47:24.200]  shoot to kill and that's such a difference that's a military type
[02:47:24.200 --> 02:47:29.280]  scenario as opposed to a civil law enforcement scenario incredible Bob
[02:47:29.280 --> 02:47:34.560]  Fletcher's on with us right now seeing Feinstein say mr. mrs. America get ready
[02:47:34.560 --> 02:47:39.440]  to turn your guns in seeing them introduce you a gun band hand your guns
[02:47:39.440 --> 02:47:44.680]  in in Illinois they say it's set to pass the military training to mow down whole
[02:47:44.680 --> 02:47:48.240]  crowds of people but using the zombie cover I just showed that mainstream news
[02:47:48.240 --> 02:47:52.880]  article seeing this whole build-up what is your take from being on the inside of
[02:47:52.880 --> 02:47:56.080]  how serious things are
[02:47:56.080 --> 02:48:04.400]  Joe Joe oh well I've got a lot of law enforcement from the past and they're all
[02:48:04.400 --> 02:48:09.760]  freaking out because they can see the federal influence coming in like crazy
[02:48:09.760 --> 02:48:16.160]  into their department so it's it's going to be nasty and what's going to be a
[02:48:16.160 --> 02:48:22.640]  shame is for these law enforcement officers whether to stay or leave and
[02:48:22.640 --> 02:48:25.760]  you know the pressure is going to be on when you start doing illegal and
[02:48:25.760 --> 02:48:32.560]  immoral things as I had to experience myself and many people do it's I'm I'm
[02:48:32.560 --> 02:48:37.440]  really I get that those same chills that you get Alex thinking what's coming oh
[02:48:37.440 --> 02:48:42.920]  it's guaranteed but I mean if 1% of gun owners fight back that's 1.5 million and
[02:48:42.920 --> 02:48:49.040]  I mean I would hide it but again that's the diabolical plan Joe I want to get
[02:48:49.040 --> 02:48:52.320]  you on the nightly news the next few nights to talk about what your sources
[02:48:52.320 --> 02:48:55.160]  are telling you that is really important breaking news thank you let's jam
[02:48:55.160 --> 02:48:59.440]  another call while Bob Fletcher a Bob Fletcher investigations is our guest

[02:49:40.400 --> 02:49:47.600]  information on gun confiscation training yes the county that I serve in the
[02:49:47.600 --> 02:49:53.040]  sheriff's department tried to get our small town police department to start
[02:49:53.040 --> 02:50:00.000]  training for door-to-door confiscations and we refused and a lot I think that's
[02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:03.480]  the way it's been going a lot of the small towns is the small close-knit
[02:50:03.480 --> 02:50:08.680]  towns the small police departments aren't gonna go along with us Jeff
[02:50:08.680 --> 02:50:13.840]  excuse me your is so you're saying you guys were told to train and to train
[02:50:13.840 --> 02:50:19.120]  with who for door-to-door gun confiscation our local county sheriff's
[02:50:19.120 --> 02:50:23.440]  department I live in New York New York is still under an assault weapons ban
[02:50:23.440 --> 02:50:28.120]  and very draconian gun laws and oh yeah your governor has said they may ban all
[02:50:28.120 --> 02:50:32.640]  the guns statewide make people turn them in New York Times yes and and and and
[02:50:32.640 --> 02:50:37.120]  who are you supposed to train with the the sheriff's department the sheriff's
[02:50:37.120 --> 02:50:41.520]  department which I'm sure somebody from the federal government has spoken with
[02:50:41.520 --> 02:50:46.680]  them and gotten them to go along and so the federal government's coming in
[02:50:46.680 --> 02:50:51.240]  saying do gun confiscation drill stay there I want to have you Bob Bob

[02:55:10.960 --> 02:55:17.160]  in they wanted my department to start training with their their SWAT teams for
[02:55:17.160 --> 02:55:23.640]  for entry and it is the biggest thing that happens in our town that we deal
[02:55:23.640 --> 02:55:28.160]  with mostly is you know maybe a bar fight or a DWI but nothing violent
[02:55:28.160 --> 02:55:32.440]  nothing criminal and now all of a sudden they want us to start training on how to
[02:55:32.440 --> 02:55:38.600]  enter houses yeah well if the larger departments it's for gun confiscation
[02:55:38.600 --> 02:55:41.440]  that is confirmed the Army's admits they're training for it they're gonna
[02:55:41.440 --> 02:55:44.520]  have beta tests where they show it everyone's turning their guns in they're
[02:55:44.520 --> 02:55:48.560]  happy that's the SIOP but that's not gonna be real and they're gonna try to
[02:55:48.560 --> 02:55:52.640]  demoralize this it's gonna be amazing god bless you Jeff let's talk to Joe in
[02:55:52.640 --> 02:55:56.120]  California you're on the air police what's your take on this are you getting
[02:55:56.120 --> 02:56:03.400]  that training Alex yes sir privilege yes I just wanted to let you know that I've
[02:56:03.400 --> 02:56:06.280]  been speaking with you for over listening to your program for over two
[02:56:06.280 --> 02:56:10.600]  years now and nobody has ever called in to tell you what I'm gonna tell you
[02:56:10.600 --> 02:56:15.760]  right now there are secret sleep sleeper cells all over the country that are
[02:56:15.760 --> 02:56:19.960]  ready and willing to take charge of the situation and I'm not talking about
[02:56:19.960 --> 02:56:25.320]  kicking people's doors in all right the people that I hang out with all ex
[02:56:25.320 --> 02:56:30.840]  military I spent 20 years in the Navy and I know that I swore an oath to the
[02:56:30.840 --> 02:56:35.720]  Constitution and the only thing that bothers me sir about you is that you
[02:56:35.720 --> 02:56:40.640]  were never in the military so you never swore an oath to the Constitution and I
[02:56:40.640 --> 02:56:45.200]  have my doubts about you being a DoD plant and I want you right now to your
[02:56:45.200 --> 02:56:51.600]  worldwide audience to tell everybody that you are for real because you offer
[02:56:51.600 --> 02:56:56.440]  you talk a lot but you don't really offer any solutions and I'm an action
[02:56:56.440 --> 02:57:01.240]  person about solutions I understand you're you're you're God and then and

[02:57:46.600 --> 02:57:52.200]  get struck down but you judge a tree by its fruits and that's political
[02:57:52.200 --> 02:57:55.720]  cognitive infiltration that Cass Sunstein talked about even if the guy's

[03:00:17.040 --> 03:00:20.760]  record I ran contra whistleblower advisor to Congress he's got some CIA
[03:00:20.760 --> 03:00:24.720]  stories and tell you in a minute about one of the top folks in the CIA and how
[03:00:24.720 --> 03:00:28.400]  he was able to pretty much start the militia movement to try to resist the
[03:00:28.400 --> 03:00:32.160]  globalist and is one of the guys that helped hold it back about ten years we
[03:00:32.160 --> 03:00:35.360]  also got some other police officers like Tom and Marilyn we're gonna get to now I
[03:00:35.360 --> 03:00:39.280]  don't think that guy was a psyop but he was repeating a psyop see a good psyop
[03:00:39.280 --> 03:00:44.200]  is put out and then other people put it out when you say we have hope we can
[03:00:44.200 --> 03:00:47.480]  restore things but we've got to admit blah blah blah that you know the New
[03:00:47.480 --> 03:00:52.640]  World Order the Federal Reserve that's not a psyop that's a patriot now
[03:00:52.640 --> 03:00:56.440]  sometimes psyops come out been doing the 17 years well really 20 but 17 on air
[03:00:56.440 --> 03:01:01.040]  and they'll for about a year never more than a year put out decent info and then
[03:01:01.040 --> 03:01:05.280]  start in fighting and putting out crazy talk so that and I'd said Hal Turner was
[03:01:05.280 --> 03:01:10.000]  a fed came out he was I mean that was obvious saying kill judges and go after
[03:01:10.000 --> 03:01:14.640]  me and all this stuff and I'm a fed and I'm like that guy's a fed anybody
[03:01:14.640 --> 03:01:17.880]  there's people on air now that's you know call for attacking the Federal
[03:01:17.880 --> 03:01:22.320]  Reserve and stuff folks if I said that the police would be here in one hour
[03:01:22.320 --> 03:01:28.280]  okay how did you deal Bob with with provocateurs and people and what's your
[03:01:28.280 --> 03:01:31.720]  take on that call you just heard where we're putting out you know the mother's
[03:01:31.720 --> 03:01:35.880]  milk info of Liberty Paul Revere and the guy opens the window and says you're a
[03:01:35.880 --> 03:01:39.240]  red coat and I'm like why would I be telling you the red coats are coming go
[03:01:39.240 --> 03:01:47.520]  ahead in a tremendous amount of situations like that people that were
[03:01:47.520 --> 03:01:50.840]  always doing that and trying to say I mean they were always constantly say you
[03:01:50.840 --> 03:01:55.160]  know the that entire Patriot movement the entire militia movement all those
[03:01:55.160 --> 03:01:59.760]  guys up at the very top first off the bad guy said that we were connected to
[03:01:59.760 --> 03:02:04.280]  the Nazis and every other crazy thing and and racist and knowledge and that
[03:02:04.280 --> 03:02:09.720]  was complete garbage with the exception of a couple of yahoos who are always out
[03:02:09.720 --> 03:02:12.640]  there sure I mean you were you were going up against a Reagan and Iran
[03:02:12.640 --> 03:02:17.600]  contrary you're not but listen the point is exactly it isn't about that it's
[03:02:17.600 --> 03:02:21.000]  about they're coming for our guns what are we gonna do and the guy says you're
[03:02:21.000 --> 03:02:23.880]  a DoD plant because you didn't serve in the military I mean what does that even
[03:02:23.880 --> 03:02:29.200]  mean you know people have gone and found my went to Rockwall and went to Austin
[03:02:29.200 --> 03:02:32.960]  and got my yearbooks they've gone and interviewed people I went to college
[03:02:32.960 --> 03:02:37.840]  with trying to prove I'm not who I say I am people think I'm 50 I'm 38 years old
[03:02:37.840 --> 03:02:43.280]  go ahead and we had an awful lot of that constantly and the bottom line in some
[03:02:43.280 --> 03:02:50.440]  cases it simply is a a disgruntled ex-serviceman who by the way I am one
[03:02:50.440 --> 03:02:55.280]  I'm not a did well and yeah disgruntled but not on the wrong side of the fence
[03:02:55.280 --> 03:03:02.440]  or very side the bottom line is we we did guys that felt that if in fact you
[03:03:02.440 --> 03:03:06.160]  weren't in the service that you have no right to talk in terms of defending the
[03:03:06.160 --> 03:03:10.920]  Constitution because you never raised your hand and and and swore to defend
[03:03:10.920 --> 03:03:16.120]  the Constitution but what do you have to point out what I constantly pointed out
[03:03:16.120 --> 03:03:20.200]  to those guys when they would say that I would say hey listen the people that are
[03:03:20.200 --> 03:03:26.200]  the bad guys the president of the United States that's taking us down the toilet
[03:03:26.200 --> 03:03:30.120]  rose raised his hand to protect the Constitution what are you talking about
[03:03:30.120 --> 03:03:36.480]  that has no bearing Bob Bob I've sworn on the altar of God eternal resistance
[03:03:36.480 --> 03:03:40.360]  to tyranny as Thomas Jefferson did I'm not swearing to the corrupt New World
[03:03:40.360 --> 03:03:44.920]  Order that hijacked my country it's asinine my deeds and I'm not here to
[03:03:44.920 --> 03:03:49.560]  justify myself but but it's a total cop-out I work sometimes 18 hours a day
[03:03:49.560 --> 03:03:54.960]  and these people don't have a micron of discernment if they don't know I'm
[03:03:54.960 --> 03:03:59.320]  totally true blue they do stuff like watch police state for and see a thing
[03:03:59.320 --> 03:04:02.960]  where it says submit to tyranny you know with a New World Order badge it's not
[03:04:02.960 --> 03:04:06.840]  subliminal it's clearly on the screen they go that's a subliminal or he has a
[03:04:06.840 --> 03:04:10.880]  pyramid saying New World Order that's subliminal you can't see a subliminal

[03:08:44.160 --> 03:08:47.960]  civil war that's the plan we got one more call from a police officer I got
[03:08:47.960 --> 03:08:51.440]  saying he's a police officer Tom in Maryland and we'll get his take on all
[03:08:51.440 --> 03:08:56.040]  this we had pastor Butch on earlier with the lieutenant McCoy with the gun
[03:08:56.040 --> 03:08:59.680]  confiscation training they're going under with the ATF in North Carolina
[03:08:59.680 --> 03:09:04.880]  that audio and videos up at in full Wars calm right now but the troops ordered to
[03:09:04.880 --> 03:09:09.520]  kill Americans who do not turn in their guns that video is posted in a new
[03:09:09.520 --> 03:09:14.040]  report with the latest info Obama would call on military to disarm Americans
[03:09:14.040 --> 03:09:18.640]  during national emergency and it's got all the proof army manuals provides
[03:09:18.640 --> 03:09:23.240]  blueprint for confiscating guns of quote rioters and dissidents and the
[03:09:23.240 --> 03:09:28.600]  reeducation camp fm3 dash 39 dot 40 how to process you and your family into the
[03:09:28.600 --> 03:09:33.240]  reeducation Center actually uses that term Bob Fleischer congressional
[03:09:33.240 --> 03:09:38.800]  whistleblower I ran contra a businessman who was basically infiltrated and they
[03:09:38.800 --> 03:09:42.080]  tried to use him for operations he helped expose him and then of course one
[03:09:42.080 --> 03:09:46.600]  of the modern founders of the militia to counter it is on with us finishing up
[03:09:46.600 --> 03:09:51.960]  with a caller right now Tom and Marilyn police officers say what what is your
[03:09:51.960 --> 03:09:59.200]  take on this have you gotten any training along this line well I thought
[03:09:59.200 --> 03:10:03.480]  I had two points that I thought would be germane and that you and your audience
[03:10:03.480 --> 03:10:10.200]  would be interested in we went through a very similar time back in the early 90s
[03:10:10.200 --> 03:10:15.200]  when they were talking about doing an assault weapons ban that's what I was
[03:10:15.200 --> 03:10:18.920]  saying I just interrupt Bob was saying that during a break that Alex we can
[03:10:18.920 --> 03:10:22.520]  stop this they did this in the early 90s I want him to respond after you're done
[03:10:22.520 --> 03:10:31.080]  I'm sorry just go ahead sure sure well I suspect that probably as far as police
[03:10:31.080 --> 03:10:34.840]  officers are concerned you'll end up with two groups like we did back in
[03:10:34.840 --> 03:10:42.960]  early 90s we had those who took their oath seriously and had a real problem
[03:10:42.960 --> 03:10:49.040]  with the thought that if a law were passed that would contradict our oath
[03:10:49.040 --> 03:10:54.440]  uphold the Constitution what would we do would we quit like the lieutenant was
[03:10:54.440 --> 03:11:00.680]  talking about earlier would we try to stay on and work and do good from the
[03:11:00.680 --> 03:11:06.880]  inside it was something that we really stressed about now about half of the
[03:11:06.880 --> 03:11:12.320]  other officers didn't take the oath seriously and then they were beholden to
[03:11:12.320 --> 03:11:17.880]  the paycheck and said outright many of them well we're just going to do what we
[03:11:17.880 --> 03:11:23.040]  need to do to keep a job I need to put food on the table it tells you right
[03:11:23.040 --> 03:11:30.480]  away you know who has honor and and who doesn't so as far as we were concerned
[03:11:30.480 --> 03:11:37.240]  of course we didn't know exactly what possible legislation would be it turned
[03:11:37.240 --> 03:11:42.680]  out that with the band we didn't feel that it was something that we had to
[03:11:42.680 --> 03:11:49.760]  take drastic action on but we had decided prior to it passing that if it
[03:11:49.760 --> 03:11:54.920]  was something that absolutely contradicted the Constitution we were
[03:11:54.920 --> 03:12:02.400]  going to start before it even was passed into law with a heavy-duty letter
[03:12:02.400 --> 03:12:07.320]  writing campaign and also the following of lawsuits I think amen we got to file
[03:12:07.320 --> 03:12:12.480]  lawsuits we got to do banner hangs we I keep me in to shoot a video I'm gonna do
[03:12:12.480 --> 03:12:16.480]  it today after the show for the nightly news where I get into solutions but then
[03:12:16.480 --> 03:12:21.760]  I there's so many let me ask you officer and then Bob Fleischer what do you think
[03:12:21.760 --> 03:12:25.720]  the number one solutions are I think just get the word out you know the fact
[03:12:25.720 --> 03:12:28.720]  that the media isn't making a big deal out of this they're making a big deal
[03:12:28.720 --> 03:12:32.200]  about the shooting saying something's got to be done but they're not telling
[03:12:32.200 --> 03:12:36.600]  people it's gun confiscation I mean that's the bill and so I think number
[03:12:36.600 --> 03:12:42.760]  one just get the word out that this is going to be a physical ban that that
[03:12:42.760 --> 03:12:47.880]  would be one of the best ways but we thought the very best way would be to
[03:12:47.880 --> 03:12:52.760]  take action in the form of following lawsuits and writing letters and and
[03:12:52.760 --> 03:12:57.360]  they really go hand in hand getting the word out and getting other people to
[03:12:57.360 --> 03:13:02.340]  realize that it's a serious issue that it's not just another wall and we're
[03:13:02.340 --> 03:13:06.200]  talking about civil rights lawsuits we're talking about and again even if
[03:13:06.200 --> 03:13:11.200]  you don't win them it gets people's attention when you sue them makes them
[03:13:11.200 --> 03:13:17.080]  respond when you file legal action and anyone can do it per se you don't have
[03:13:17.080 --> 03:13:22.840]  to hire a lawyer it only takes your time and your willingness to do what you you
[03:13:22.840 --> 03:13:28.000]  know is right and like I said about 50% maybe a little bit more of the officers
[03:13:28.000 --> 03:13:33.400]  really believed that it was the right thing to do and that it was a priority
[03:13:33.400 --> 03:13:38.240]  what's happening now I mean people you talk to officers you talk to now are
[03:13:38.240 --> 03:13:43.520]  they are they concerned about all this gun confiscation move well the options
[03:13:43.520 --> 03:13:49.560]  that I talk to now are very concerned about the new generation if you will of
[03:13:49.560 --> 03:13:57.240]  police officers we see things being done that we never would have done that we
[03:13:57.240 --> 03:14:02.840]  probably would have been fired for I don't know how they're developing their
[03:14:02.840 --> 03:14:06.480]  general orders or their standard operating procedures whatever they're
[03:14:06.480 --> 03:14:12.920]  calling them now but there's a lot of actions being taken and defended that
[03:14:12.920 --> 03:14:21.280]  we're just appalled at there was a marine killed you can see video of raids
[03:14:21.280 --> 03:14:26.760]  taking place you know when we did a dynamic entry it was just that it was a
[03:14:26.760 --> 03:14:32.360]  dynamic entry and the goal was that no one got hurt and that the warrant was
[03:14:32.360 --> 03:14:38.400]  properly served you look at a lot of what's going on these days and it's as
[03:14:38.400 --> 03:14:43.600]  though they're going in for a shooting match no they want to kill somebody
[03:14:43.600 --> 03:14:49.520]  because that's manly and that's not at all what it's about and in defense of
[03:14:49.520 --> 03:14:54.200]  the good officers can we believe there's still a good number of good officers out
[03:14:54.200 --> 03:15:02.440]  there I can't imagine how they're reconciling the old school if you will
[03:15:02.440 --> 03:15:06.680]  with this new generation well let me tell you god bless you god bless you
[03:15:06.680 --> 03:15:10.800]  sir and the great points you've made I have been around feds and people at gun
[03:15:10.800 --> 03:15:15.960]  shows and stuff and they'll come right over and go yeah Jones we you know what
[03:15:15.960 --> 03:15:19.320]  are you doing here and they look like a guy out of a Hollywood movie who's a
[03:15:19.320 --> 03:15:24.440]  criminal I mean they're like obviously horrible scum and you're like what do
[03:15:24.440 --> 03:15:29.120]  you think you're intimidating me I mean they're gangsters and it just gets my
[03:15:29.120 --> 03:15:33.640]  hackles up at so many levels that we are really a pathetic nation that we put up
[03:15:33.640 --> 03:15:38.000]  with this and most police I see don't act like total thugs but you see units
[03:15:38.000 --> 03:15:42.160]  of them you know where they're like all on roids and shaved heads and wearing
[03:15:42.160 --> 03:15:45.880]  black gloves and gooning at you and I'm the type of person when somebody looks
[03:15:45.880 --> 03:15:48.800]  something like a goon I mean I'm not looking for trouble and that just gets
[03:15:48.800 --> 03:15:53.680]  me like whoa whoa you're trying to dominate me I mean there's such shameful
[03:15:53.680 --> 03:15:57.140]  people that it makes me want to climb up on top of them and show them who you
[03:15:57.140 --> 03:16:00.720]  know you know what you know what a real man is because it's fundamentally
[03:16:00.720 --> 03:16:04.720]  upsetting Bob Fletcher do you know what I'm talking about I mean the sickness of
[03:16:04.720 --> 03:16:09.600]  a goon they're like little arrested kids little arrested of course you know those
[03:16:09.600 --> 03:16:15.360]  are the guys that are selected selected internally and brought forward and run
[03:16:15.360 --> 03:16:21.160]  through the system I'll call them the bad guys run through their system put
[03:16:21.160 --> 03:16:27.120]  them forward and say hey this guy will fit in great for either doing undercover
[03:16:27.120 --> 03:16:32.280]  or doing psychological psych ops to scare the pudding out of some average
[03:16:32.280 --> 03:16:36.400]  citizen you know so they're put over here they get a separate file you know
[03:16:36.400 --> 03:16:40.400]  they're removed and they say hey they call them over and bring bring them up
[03:16:40.400 --> 03:16:44.440]  and say listen Joey we we want to give you a raise and we want to put you into
[03:16:44.440 --> 03:16:49.320]  our special ops over here and it'll be exciting it'll be this it'll be but
[03:16:49.320 --> 03:16:52.520]  don't the globalist cowards know that with the average man somebody acting
[03:16:52.520 --> 03:16:57.240]  intimidating towards them doesn't intimidate you you know the again the
[03:16:57.240 --> 03:17:01.600]  bottom line is if you can you know if you can scare one guy he's usually
[03:17:01.600 --> 03:17:06.200]  whoever he is you know he's gonna drag down another handful of all along with
[03:17:06.200 --> 03:17:09.960]  him some of his friends or family and you know I'm gonna say hey we got to do
[03:17:09.960 --> 03:17:14.440]  this we got to do that when they do this martial law and they go to the first
[03:17:14.440 --> 03:17:19.480]  homes the initial ones where they kick in the doors and they say bring out your
[03:17:19.480 --> 03:17:25.080]  guns and the first guy that says I'm not gonna let you know I'm not I'm not gonna
[03:17:25.080 --> 03:17:28.920]  give you my gun they're just gonna shoot them in the doorway that's right and
[03:17:28.920 --> 03:17:33.160]  they're gonna videotape it and then they're gonna show that on the news and
[03:17:33.160 --> 03:17:37.640]  and I got news that's impressive to the five people that are watching in the
[03:17:37.640 --> 03:17:41.200]  neighborhood and they're all gonna have their guns out on the front porch by the
[03:17:41.200 --> 03:17:47.920]  next afternoon and that's the kindest yeah I predict five and ten percent are
[03:17:47.920 --> 03:17:54.160]  gonna go hunting it's gonna be bad and that's literally part of it oh what I
[03:17:54.160 --> 03:17:59.960]  wanted to mention we talked about a while back I had a very close friend
[03:17:59.960 --> 03:18:04.600]  that had been involved with the CIA going through several different
[03:18:04.600 --> 03:18:10.160]  presidential administrations a very high-level person highly respected the
[03:18:10.160 --> 03:18:15.600]  very fact that and by the way was a lady and the fact that she was involved with
[03:18:15.600 --> 03:18:20.080]  several administrations in the intelligence community shows to what she
[03:18:20.080 --> 03:18:28.400]  was and I asked her one time because it was making me crazy I was watching news
[03:18:28.400 --> 03:18:33.880]  in Los Angeles when I was living there for a while and and there was this huge
[03:18:33.880 --> 03:18:39.840]  a bomb scare situation and it involved helicopters and the bomb squad and all
[03:18:39.840 --> 03:18:44.800]  kinds of stuff and they were doing this live broadcast and everything but then
[03:18:44.800 --> 03:18:48.280]  when I brought it up I think on a television or a radio interview or
[03:18:48.280 --> 03:18:52.640]  something the next day or a couple days later nobody knew what I was talking
[03:18:52.640 --> 03:18:57.320]  about and I said they said it wasn't broadcast they didn't see anything they
[03:18:57.320 --> 03:19:00.920]  didn't know anything about it and I said this was in downtown Los Angeles with
[03:19:00.920 --> 03:19:05.400]  wires and bombs and stuff coming and hanging out of the door of this big truck
[03:19:05.400 --> 03:19:12.640]  and all this and so I asked my friend in Washington I said how is it that United
[03:19:12.640 --> 03:19:19.640]  Press International Associated Press and all of the the middle distribution for
[03:19:19.640 --> 03:19:26.040]  media how is it that they obviously didn't even pass that through and this
[03:19:26.040 --> 03:19:29.840]  is a point in time you know after the Oklahoma bombings and all that stuff in
[03:19:29.840 --> 03:19:33.960]  the Murrah building internet wasn't big yet she said operation mockingbird there
[03:19:33.960 --> 03:19:39.880]  was none so but the point was she simply told me that for several years
[03:19:39.880 --> 03:19:45.280]  progressively the people that were doing the New World Order move on America had
[03:19:45.280 --> 03:19:53.480]  been placing totally prepaid employees at the highest level of management and
[03:19:53.480 --> 03:19:59.680]  these were the guys that would say this story goes out on the public or this
[03:19:59.680 --> 03:20:05.240]  story just stays as a little local thing and so they had totally implanted the
[03:20:05.240 --> 03:20:10.920]  control mechanism and that was how they were able to keep stories from the West
[03:20:10.920 --> 03:20:16.200]  Coast from the East Coast and what-have-you and maintain control and of
[03:20:16.200 --> 03:20:19.320]  course you separately learned about that but that came out in the church hearings
[03:20:19.320 --> 03:20:29.280]  in the 70s about operation mockingbird but now what are they gonna do what are
[03:20:29.280 --> 03:20:32.560]  they gonna do now though they don't control all the talk radio I know they
[03:20:32.560 --> 03:20:38.400]  don't control me they don't control the news sites but still I see stuff where
[03:20:38.400 --> 03:20:42.600]  it's a huge news story you never see it on mainline news that's why they want
[03:20:42.600 --> 03:20:46.000]  the internet kill switch and want to shut down radio with the fairness
[03:20:46.000 --> 03:20:50.160]  doctrine right and basically this I want to point this out to everybody that's
[03:20:50.160 --> 03:20:56.200]  listening also when when they do the martial law there will be no more
[03:20:56.200 --> 03:20:59.460]  internet you can kiss that goodbye that's the internet kill switch they
[03:20:59.460 --> 03:21:02.760]  admit that that's right and whether they've got it in other words whether
[03:21:02.760 --> 03:21:07.860]  they have the quote-unquote legal capability to do that that will have
[03:21:07.860 --> 03:21:11.400]  nothing to do with it it would be an executive order that makes it legal
[03:21:11.400 --> 03:21:16.560]  they're gonna throw the switch and we no longer have our internet even three and
[03:21:16.560 --> 03:21:20.520]  a half years ago with the swine flu you can pull this up White House considered
[03:21:20.520 --> 03:21:25.840]  redirecting sites to CDC it was in mainstream news we can pull that up for
[03:21:25.840 --> 03:21:30.800]  people they actually said Bob they looked at redirecting everything the
[03:21:30.800 --> 03:21:36.680]  entire web or portions of it to a government announcement about to protect
[03:21:36.680 --> 03:21:41.240]  yourself from the flu so they admit they have and notice a few months ago Obama
[03:21:41.240 --> 03:21:46.420]  signed a cyber order but told Congress they can't see it I mean that right
[03:21:46.420 --> 03:21:52.800]  there is a dictator it's unbelievable it has grown and grown and grown we warn
[03:21:52.800 --> 03:21:58.320]  people very specifically in the early 90s people thought we were absolutely
[03:21:58.320 --> 03:22:06.400]  crazy and and and by the way there are also there are still how do you say this
[03:22:06.400 --> 03:22:12.640]  there are weapons and things going on at a high level an extraordinary high level
[03:22:12.640 --> 03:22:18.880]  of technology that we still don't have a good handle on other words we know they
[03:22:18.880 --> 03:22:24.200]  have lasers we know that microwaves we know have a B and C and D and we we have
[03:22:24.200 --> 03:22:29.600]  pretty good exposes on some of that I remember people five years ago saying
[03:22:29.600 --> 03:22:33.400]  the new census would be to mark our front doors to fire missiles at us and
[03:22:33.400 --> 03:22:36.840]  then a few years later they did the census and they marked our doors and
[03:22:36.840 --> 03:22:41.280]  then now they've admitted they are using the marking for drones and they're gonna
[03:22:41.280 --> 03:22:45.600]  use and are using predators and Reapers in our skies and they're gonna launch
[03:22:45.600 --> 03:22:50.360]  30,000 already paid for against us and then police officers are confirming it I
[03:22:50.360 --> 03:22:57.280]  mean it is cuckoo crazy takeover because they want they hate us they want to have
[03:22:57.280 --> 03:23:02.320]  their way with us Bob yeah and it also becomes a bigger challenge you know it's
[03:23:02.320 --> 03:23:07.480]  and and I'll tell you what the psyche of these people who are that's why I
[03:23:07.480 --> 03:23:10.760]  wanted to get you on let me stop you you worked in and around Congress and were
[03:23:10.760 --> 03:23:14.640]  around the intelligence community and blew the whistle on this stuff what is
[03:23:14.640 --> 03:23:18.920]  the psyche because they were bad thirty years ago twenty years ago but now it's
[03:23:18.920 --> 03:23:26.880]  just bull just amazing absolutely off of their rocker say it's I've met these
[03:23:26.880 --> 03:23:31.720]  guys I had one general you know I was involved with a 24 million dollar lawsuit
[03:23:31.720 --> 03:23:36.080]  filed by the Kristic Institute and that was right in the middle of the Iran
[03:23:36.080 --> 03:23:41.760]  conscious stuff actually was prior to by about a year so the actual filings and
[03:23:41.760 --> 03:23:46.200]  it was and basically it was the Iran conscious stuff drugs dope murder
[03:23:46.200 --> 03:23:51.120]  weapons and all of that stuff and all the exact people that later were dragged
[03:23:51.120 --> 03:23:57.000]  through the through the hearings which didn't accomplish anything but those
[03:23:57.000 --> 03:24:03.520]  those one of those generals in reference to myself and other people that were
[03:24:03.520 --> 03:24:09.400]  involved with witnessing he said boy if I was in Vietnam right now I'd blow that
[03:24:09.400 --> 03:24:15.320]  and then he used vulgarity that I won't even use a free three-letter vulgarity
[03:24:15.320 --> 03:24:21.920]  for describing myself and other witnesses and and those guys were in
[03:24:21.920 --> 03:24:27.080]  bed with Pablo Escobar and all the rest no no they're drug dealers now they run
[03:24:27.080 --> 03:24:31.600]  little kids snuff films and then they sit around and actually exactly sit
[03:24:31.600 --> 03:24:36.440]  around and go I'm a veteran I fought in a war I am the good guy they actually
[03:24:36.440 --> 03:24:39.800]  think they're the good guy we put cancer viruses in your vaccines because we're
[03:24:39.800 --> 03:24:45.480]  good exactly they're all because the worst most murderous ones are the ones
[03:24:45.480 --> 03:24:52.080]  that trough their way up to the head of the line yeah the problem is so many of
[03:24:52.080 --> 03:24:56.840]  them started out you know I think they start out okay you know it's that same
[03:24:56.840 --> 03:25:02.880]  old story it doesn't it doesn't help the the end the end product but they start
[03:25:02.880 --> 03:25:07.120]  out doing the thing right it's ever in it next thing you know it's it's money
[03:25:07.120 --> 03:25:15.000]  and drugs and power and the power control this this nut case that came in
[03:25:15.000 --> 03:25:19.920]  and took over my business to use it as a covert front he had several businesses
[03:25:19.920 --> 03:25:26.560]  took another guy for excuse me took another fellow for 13 million dollars a
[03:25:26.560 --> 03:25:29.560]  couple of years yeah that's the thing why because I've studied this in
[03:25:29.560 --> 03:25:32.640]  mainline declassification they come in they say they're doing a merger with a
[03:25:32.640 --> 03:25:35.960]  shipping company then they go hey by the way we're CIA here come the generals
[03:25:35.960 --> 03:25:39.480]  here come the computers we're going to use you as a front and then they don't
[03:25:39.480 --> 03:25:43.360]  even pay you and say we'll just kill you if you don't shut up and then they you
[03:25:43.360 --> 03:25:46.160]  know they have their wives killed they I mean they're just a bunch of psychopaths
[03:25:46.160 --> 03:25:52.000]  that's what they did with me and when I was at the high point of blowing the
[03:25:52.000 --> 03:25:56.160]  whistle after like a couple of years where I actually was having phone calls
[03:25:56.160 --> 03:26:03.880]  on a regular basis from senators John Kerry and other people at my at my work
[03:26:03.880 --> 03:26:08.120]  because I still have to maintain I just have to feed my family I'm in there at
[03:26:08.120 --> 03:26:13.840]  nine o'clock in the morning one day and a guy drove his station wagon right
[03:26:13.840 --> 03:26:19.280]  through my sliding glass doors in Orlando Florida missed killing me only
[03:26:19.280 --> 03:26:25.120]  only because the rear wheels of the wagon hung up on the curb right there
[03:26:25.120 --> 03:26:28.600]  with him oh yeah that's their favorite way is with cars it was just an
[03:26:28.600 --> 03:26:34.200]  accident it was an accident and a week prior to that we run a guy off that was
[03:26:34.200 --> 03:26:39.560]  videotaping the property what he was doing was videotaping the property ahead
[03:26:39.560 --> 03:26:45.560]  of this guy making his erroneous but I'm sure they'll be much nicer once they get
[03:26:45.560 --> 03:26:51.680]  our guns Bob yeah it's unbelievable but but they when we talk about their psyche
[03:26:51.680 --> 03:27:00.760]  the this individual that took over my my business he was so he was crazy and but
[03:27:00.760 --> 03:27:06.320]  and he was but he was successful at what he was doing for the government he was
[03:27:06.320 --> 03:27:12.480]  supplying weapons and helicopters and aircraft all over the world for all of
[03:27:12.480 --> 03:27:17.920]  these variety of you know like if he was still alive now he'd be doing it for
[03:27:17.920 --> 03:27:22.440]  everything that's in the Mideast rate Syrian rebels yes all of it all of that
[03:27:22.440 --> 03:27:26.640]  stuff he would have been involved within Libya and all the rest of that because
[03:27:26.640 --> 03:27:31.600]  he was back then involved all over the world with this stuff and he was so such
[03:27:31.600 --> 03:27:36.960]  a loose cannon you know he carried his stuff like in a paper bag he had like
[03:27:36.960 --> 03:27:42.720]  six or eight or ten passports which of course is totally illegal for anybody
[03:27:42.720 --> 03:27:49.120]  except the CIA different countries names and people and all that stuff big boxes
[03:27:49.120 --> 03:27:53.800]  of money had cash you couldn't imagine the money they believe me I know I have
[03:27:53.800 --> 03:27:59.040]  a let's just say great uncle I that it's really a great cousin but anyways the
[03:27:59.040 --> 03:28:04.120]  whole story is he was an army officer and and and all he's told us was he said
[03:28:04.120 --> 03:28:07.360]  yeah you know I did all this stuff in covert operations so then they bring me
[03:28:07.360 --> 03:28:12.640]  in they go well here's your graduation in the CIA and it was dealing drugs and
[03:28:12.640 --> 03:28:16.840]  killing people in Chicago and he said I'm not and well I'm not gonna he didn't
[03:28:16.840 --> 03:28:22.200]  tell us much more the point is is that the thing is then I know other people
[03:28:22.200 --> 03:28:26.240]  who have done I mean it's this is like it's not like a big deal to work for CIA
[03:28:26.240 --> 03:28:30.640]  it's like working for UPS except they're running around killing people I mean
[03:28:30.640 --> 03:28:37.200]  it's a giant operation worldwide as soon as we as soon as I filed with my lawyer
[03:28:37.200 --> 03:28:42.960]  started to pursue what would have been just standard legal thing really the
[03:28:42.960 --> 03:28:47.200]  contractual thing I couldn't forget it I knew you know what can I do against the
[03:28:47.200 --> 03:28:53.120]  Uncle Sam but I I found a standard legal action started getting information with
[03:28:53.120 --> 03:28:57.400]  my lawyer to simply sue this guy to get the quarter of a million dollars he owed
[03:28:57.400 --> 03:29:05.160]  me which back then was a lot of money okay and I did I get a certification
[03:29:05.160 --> 03:29:09.040]  came from executive orders of the President of the United States the
[03:29:09.040 --> 03:29:13.160]  information that we were pursuing was classified he was talking about my my
[03:29:13.160 --> 03:29:18.680]  toy factory so they basically classified my toy factory for the big rubber stamp
[03:29:18.680 --> 03:29:23.880]  that said secret classified operation no more information will be coming in and
[03:29:23.880 --> 03:29:29.000]  no court will handle your case you know you can't you can't go anyplace if you
[03:29:29.000 --> 03:29:34.200]  got this the CIA tells a local judge and what's incredible Bob is they now are
[03:29:34.200 --> 03:29:37.480]  going to fully gut the country and bring it all down and rob us like a third
[03:29:37.480 --> 03:29:41.440]  world nation Bob pleasure investigations calm amazing look forward to having you
[03:29:41.440 --> 03:29:45.320]  back on very soon they are trying to move on us right now but if we get the
[03:29:45.320 --> 03:30:05.920]  word out like Bob did we can back them off again
