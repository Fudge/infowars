[00:23.000 --> 00:33.000]  You are listening to GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:39.000 --> 00:47.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[00:47.000 --> 00:56.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59.000 --> 01:06.000]  Welcome everyone listening in the United States and across the world, as well as the ship's FC.
[01:06.000 --> 01:16.000]  I'm Alex Jones, your host. It is already the third day of 2007, the third day of January 2007.
[01:16.000 --> 01:32.000]  We'll be live here for the next three hours. We have two guests, both fighting against the Orwellian police state that is encroaching on all of our lives at an increasing and more frequent rate joining us in the third hour.
[01:32.000 --> 01:52.000]  One of them follows in a long train of listeners. This stuff has been in the newspaper, by the way, in many of these cases, where listeners simply give people terror storms, road to tyrannies, and the BATF assaults them, the police arrest them, the state police arrest them.
[01:52.000 --> 02:03.000]  I have a registered nurse coming on in the third hour, Shirley Anderson, and she wrote a letter to the editor. That's her main crime. That's how it started.
[02:03.000 --> 02:13.000]  They wanted her to go under psychological evaluation. Her letter to the editor is very well written. In fact, we're going to publish this up on jonesreport.com the next 30 minutes.
[02:13.000 --> 02:22.000]  Very well written, just about the history of the military industrial complex and the police state, and that the government's involved in 9-11.
[02:22.000 --> 02:35.000]  In her small town, it's kind of like invasion of the body snatchers. If you're not one of them, it's very upsetting. They'd knock down her door, busted her head open, unannounced, and even knocked.
[02:35.000 --> 02:41.000]  Then they do what they always do. They charge you with assault when you just lay there and take it.
[02:41.000 --> 02:52.000]  Kind of like in New Orleans, the cops gun down two innocent people and then arrest the brother of the retarded man they killed just to try to cover it up.
[02:52.000 --> 03:04.000]  See, that's the big crime. I can understand in a melee, in a hysteria, being untrained boobs, and please don't send me an email saying that's profane.
[03:04.000 --> 03:16.000]  A boob is a type of South Pacific pirate. The point is, behaving like a bunch of pirates and shooting people, that's just serious negligence.
[03:16.000 --> 03:26.000]  But then trying to frame people that you've injured or who you've murdered people in front of, it's just unbelievable.
[03:26.000 --> 03:34.000]  We'll play a clip concerning that coming up in this hour, but she's joining us. And then some family friends.
[03:34.000 --> 03:44.000]  I'd say they're acquaintances. I've met the husband three or four times, and I know the mother, the wife, pretty darn good for about, I guess, eight years or so.
[03:44.000 --> 03:49.000]  I've even been to the local fair with their children and my children.
[03:49.000 --> 03:56.000]  She had bloodshot eyes from allergies. Frankly, I have a bloodshot eye right now, from allergies.
[03:56.000 --> 04:02.000]  And so they thought that must be evidence of drugs. I know the family, they don't even drink.
[04:02.000 --> 04:09.000]  And so, in fact, what was the time of the husband last night? He's been a T-totally for 23 years, AA, I guess.
[04:09.000 --> 04:15.000]  But it didn't matter, bloodshot eyes. Boom, CPS is hitting them, hitting them hard.
[04:15.000 --> 04:20.000]  That's how America works. Nobody sees my bloodshot eye, but it's only one today.
[04:20.000 --> 04:27.000]  Not allergies, I wake up with like one huge bloodshot eye. Kind of scary looking, but again, I'm evil too.
[04:27.000 --> 04:43.000]  This is the secret police country we live in. And, again, James Panic coming up in the last 30 minutes of the show today with the CPS after him.
[04:43.000 --> 04:49.000]  And again, this is it. We get probably 10 calls a day, people having CPS grab their kids all over the country.
[04:49.000 --> 04:57.000]  These are people I know, okay? These are people I know. And their daughter's 11.
[04:57.000 --> 05:03.000]  Just wait till you hear the story. It's coming up.
[05:03.000 --> 05:18.000]  In the meantime, I do want to have open phones today in the first two hours. 1-800-259-9231-1800-2599231.
[05:18.000 --> 05:26.000]  Think Tank. Israel could attack Iran's nuclear program alone, this out of Harass.
[05:26.000 --> 05:35.000]  Also, Daddy Bush attacks JFK conspiracy theories. We confirm he did do that. 2006 was a deadly year for journalists and war.
[05:35.000 --> 05:44.000]  It's here after a year in production and traveling to distant lands. My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[05:44.000 --> 05:52.000]  Shocking, declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[05:52.000 --> 06:00.000]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[06:00.000 --> 06:12.000]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[06:12.000 --> 06:18.000]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorists. It's an anthology of government crimes.
[06:18.000 --> 06:35.000]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see. Get your copy today on Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com, or by calling toll-free 1-888-2533-139, or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[06:35.000 --> 06:45.000]  Terrorism, terrorism, chemical attacks, dirty bombs, haul-out, biological attacks, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic, alarming words for our time.
[06:45.000 --> 06:48.000]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[06:48.000 --> 07:03.000]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LaBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist with the U.S. government.
[07:03.000 --> 07:05.000]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[07:05.000 --> 07:16.000]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter. If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video sheltering in place.

[07:37.000 --> 07:50.000]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass? Well, the glass has a natural resonance. If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[07:50.000 --> 08:09.000]  Using a similar principle, Royal Raymond Wright discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies. The biosolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions with no side effects. The 2006 Biosolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.
[08:09.000 --> 08:22.000]  Its easy reference guide will allow you to begin using the instrument within minutes. Simple step-by-step instructions using pictures are easy to follow. Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back. Don't just treat symptoms. Eliminate the cause.

[08:35.000 --> 08:42.000]  Ease the T-Rex at Political Talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[08:42.000 --> 09:05.000]  Alright, got two police state cases coming up in the third hour as I mentioned in the last segment. One out of Washington State, the other out of Austin, Texas. Or a suburb of Austin.
[09:05.000 --> 09:28.000]  Also, I'll probably have Kevin Smith and Aaron Dykes in briefly in the second hour to give you a play-by-play of what developed out at the official Family Living Center, the FEMA camp being operated by private contractors with Homeland Security in Taylor, Texas.
[09:28.000 --> 09:43.000]  A lot happened after the show ended yesterday. Also, I didn't finish playing clips of a Twilight Zone episode that the obsolete man, so we'll play the last five minutes of that coming up in the second hour as well.
[09:43.000 --> 09:58.000]  In this hour, I have a CNN clip where the real crime is hidden in plain view. You got these police gunning down some people, and then you've got in a gangland a show of support.
[09:58.000 --> 10:16.000]  The hundreds of police officers lining up to cheer them as triumphant centurions coming back into Rome. But there's an interesting little edge to all of it that I'll point out coming up.
[10:16.000 --> 10:28.000]  Also, in India, they found a house full of a whole bunch of body parts of small children with two degenerate pieces of filth that were in there, raping, torturing, and killing them.
[10:28.000 --> 10:36.000]  And I think I'll air this because it dovetails with a BBC report today. London Telegraph report as well about what the UN does to children.
[10:36.000 --> 10:56.000]  Just because the general public needs to figure out there are evil people out there, and they're not just in dirty houses off the side of a slum in India, they're right here in the US, and they tend to get into positions of power.
[10:56.000 --> 11:19.000]  And their main goal is to set up a whole powerful government so no one can escape them to start killing. And if you know anything about history, that scary statement I just made will be illustrated to you as, well, just prima facie evidence, red-handed evidence.
[11:19.000 --> 11:39.000]  Really, you can separate people on this planet into a few different groups. There are folks that just never get a clue, never figure out what life is really all about, who mean well and are manipulated by different elements of the global crime syndicate
[11:39.000 --> 11:53.000]  into exerting their energies into what they would see as charity, but what is actually used to oppress and dumb down and, yes, kill large numbers of our fellow humans.
[11:53.000 --> 12:17.000]  Then you got two other groups, and there's different subgroups of each group, and you've got one group that only cares about themselves, that is constantly 110% focused on satiating their most base desires and appetites.
[12:17.000 --> 12:45.000]  And then you've got individuals who I wouldn't call saintly, or even pious, but who understand that life is literally a flash in the pan, and who feel that they're part of a larger continuity of human society and history and family.
[12:45.000 --> 12:51.000]  I mean, we're all going to wake up dead. You're going to, it's going to seem like tomorrow. Life goes by like that.
[12:51.000 --> 12:56.000]  If you're young, you're really young, you probably haven't figured this out yet. By the time you get to middle age, you will.
[12:56.000 --> 13:10.000]  That so many people you know around you die, so many people you've loved die, so many people you respect, you see them fall, you see them break down, you see them die, and that's part of the process of life.
[13:10.000 --> 13:17.000]  And you're supposed to become a better person as you get older, not a more decadent and wicked person as you get older.
[13:17.000 --> 13:33.000]  And really, if you want to get down to base psychology, the most evil of the earlier group I mentioned, the second group I mentioned, of the three who only care about themselves,
[13:33.000 --> 13:40.000]  well, by the time those type of individuals get old, they hate the young.
[13:40.000 --> 13:54.000]  You know, angry old man, mean old man, mean old woman, and they despise the young who are now having their time in the sun.
[13:54.000 --> 14:04.000]  And a lot of these Dr. Scrooge types, Mr. Scrooge types, don't have a family, or if they do, their family doesn't like them.
[14:04.000 --> 14:10.000]  Or if they raise their children, they raise them wrong to be self-centered, so they're not taking care of them, so there's no relationship.
[14:10.000 --> 14:19.000]  And so really, at the end, they just want to deal out death to everybody else, because all they've got is their own personal selfish life.
[14:19.000 --> 14:30.000]  And so in some weird psychological ism that they project, they go around trying to enslave and hurt and abuse and kill people.
[14:30.000 --> 14:35.000]  And again, I'll state it, history is our teacher on this.
[14:35.000 --> 14:46.000]  We have the revelation of history, watching other people's mistakes, seeing how humans behave and interact over and over again the exact same way.
[14:46.000 --> 15:02.000]  You see, I take every moment as a precious jewel, and every day as a gift from God, and I am completely driven to try to lay down foundations that are good for my children,
[15:02.000 --> 15:05.000]  and hence their children and their children and their children to come after them.
[15:05.000 --> 15:08.000]  I mean, think about it, you love your children, don't you? You love your grandchildren.
[15:08.000 --> 15:11.000]  Those of you that are blessed enough to be alive, well, you have great grandchildren.
[15:11.000 --> 15:13.000]  You love them as much as you love your own children.
[15:13.000 --> 15:21.000]  In a way, maybe even more. Wouldn't you love a great, great, great, great-grandchild if you could meet them?
[15:21.000 --> 15:26.000]  Or how about your progeny of 1,000 generations?
[15:26.000 --> 15:39.000]  And every major civilization that was built, every gleaming civilization, every civilization that revolutionized technology and brought humanity forward was based
[15:39.000 --> 15:46.000]  on the core issue of, we're not going to be here long. We need to leave a better world for those that are coming after us.
[15:46.000 --> 15:52.000]  We need to have honor. We need to have courage. We need to have duty.
[15:52.000 --> 15:56.000]  But those societies always build themselves up. They always have incredible success.
[15:56.000 --> 16:02.000]  And then as soon as people stop caring about each other, and as soon as people stop caring about justice,
[16:02.000 --> 16:10.000]  and as soon as people start saying, eh, things are corrupt. That's the way it's always been. And get that cynical spirit, that sickness.
[16:10.000 --> 16:18.000]  Societies burn out within decades. They fall in relatively short periods of time.
[16:18.000 --> 16:27.000]  And we are now falling like a comet towards the earth, burning out, burning out like a cinder, burning bright.
[16:27.000 --> 16:36.000]  And I sit here in literal, white-knuckled horror to know that the very people that set up the communists and the fascists,
[16:36.000 --> 16:43.000]  the very people that installed Mao Zedong, the very people who have introduced AIDS, there's no doubting it.
[16:43.000 --> 16:48.000]  We have the Pentagon documents, the Navy documents, introduced AIDS to Africa and Asia,
[16:48.000 --> 16:52.000]  and we have the documents in the 50s where they wanted to develop it.
[16:52.000 --> 16:57.000]  The very people that have caused millions of children to be brain damaged from mercury in the shots,
[16:57.000 --> 17:06.000]  they are setting up a literal wonderland, a butcher shop for a bunch of hounds to go in and just feed.
[17:06.000 --> 17:14.000]  And they're lovingly crafting and laying it down and carving every edge of this juggernaut,
[17:14.000 --> 17:22.000]  and oiling it, and petting it, and kissing it, and just looking at us with literal eyes that burn like the pits of hell.
[17:22.000 --> 17:27.000]  And I'm just sitting here looking at this army building, massing, feeding on us now.
[17:27.000 --> 17:32.000]  I mean, but do you think this is bad? This is only a prelude.
[17:32.000 --> 17:37.000]  So I'm beating my drum and I'm saying, look, look, look, the enemy is already here.
[17:37.000 --> 17:48.000]  Its vanguard has already overrun us, but look at the main host, the legion upon legion upon legion.
[17:48.000 --> 17:53.000]  And that's what happens when you only submerge yourself in the flesh.
[17:53.000 --> 17:57.000]  And I'm not sitting here saying I'm not someone who's attracted to the flesh.
[17:57.000 --> 18:04.000]  I'm a very fleshly person. I've been very worldly in my life.
[18:04.000 --> 18:10.000]  Not for the last 10 years or so.
[18:10.000 --> 18:17.000]  And I know that if you go into darkness and as you get deeper into it, most people don't turn back.
[18:17.000 --> 18:30.000]  They just keep falling and their whole soul literally gets turned over to wickedness.
[18:30.000 --> 18:35.000]  Talking to top psychologists and psychologists who studied serial killers, it's like they're not alive.
[18:35.000 --> 18:42.000]  They're like zombies, except when they're getting some woman in a car, except when they're bounding them,
[18:42.000 --> 18:44.000]  except when they're raping them and killing them.
[18:44.000 --> 18:50.000]  And they describe it as a white light. It's like they're alive when they're doing that.
[18:50.000 --> 18:54.000]  It's like a drug addict. That's how evil works.
[18:54.000 --> 19:04.000]  It's a small dosage, huge effect up front, and by the end you're taking massive quantities and you don't even feel good.
[19:04.000 --> 19:12.000]  And so I want you to know that Queen Beatrice of the Netherlands and the Queen of England and David Rockefeller and Lord Rothschild,
[19:12.000 --> 19:18.000]  they want to kill your children. They want to take your swimming pools and your nice houses.
[19:18.000 --> 19:26.000]  But more importantly, they want to take your minds and literature and thought. They are envious of your incredible intelligence and your beauty.
[19:26.000 --> 19:33.000]  They're envious of the freedom that our forefathers built. They are threatened by you.
[19:33.000 --> 19:44.000]  They are totally greedy and they want to get rid of the majority of the population so that they can then publicly use the life extension technologies
[19:44.000 --> 19:46.000]  and other things they've developed for themselves.
[19:46.000 --> 19:51.000]  They openly say, and I told you this long before it was in main print, now it's all over the newspapers,
[19:51.000 --> 19:57.000]  that, well, we can't let life extension be given to the general public with six and a half billion people by the world's overpopulated.
[19:57.000 --> 20:06.000]  We've got to reduce the population and then we can have a more well-refined, eugenic, racial hygiene elite that will then go on to the stars.
[20:06.000 --> 20:20.000]  And so while you play out there and watch your football and drink your beer, and while you always try to feed the satyr in yourself,
[20:20.000 --> 20:24.000]  you're losing what life is really all about.
[20:24.000 --> 20:36.000]  We'll be right back and I'll get into the news, your phone calls and a lot more.
[20:36.000 --> 20:40.000]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in U.S. are located?

[21:35.000 --> 21:44.000]  David J. Smith for NewsWatch Magazine. Did you know that communism has stated that America would not jump from capitalism to communism?
[21:44.000 --> 21:53.000]  But our elected leaders would pass laws to socialize American, and one day we would wake up and have socialism, communism, and not even know how it happened.
[21:53.000 --> 21:58.000]  Have we seen this very type of socialization of America over the last 60 years?
[21:58.000 --> 22:06.000]  We've been pushed far down the slippery slope of socialism, communism, and don't even know it, just as Nikita Khrushchev said.

[23:35.000 --> 23:39.000]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[23:39.000 --> 23:51.000]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase outpacing its previous 10 years.
[23:51.000 --> 23:58.000]  The U.S. economy receives its currency by taking on debt through private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[23:58.000 --> 24:06.000]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%. It's bad enough that the U.S. citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[24:06.000 --> 24:12.000]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.

[24:35.000 --> 24:38.000]  Federal agents, we are armed!
[24:38.000 --> 24:54.000]  What would you really do? You are nothing to me. Would you stand up for truth? What would you turn over to? What would you do if you saw all of the things that's wrong?
[24:54.000 --> 25:09.000]  Would you stand tall and strong? Oh, would you turn it off? What would you really do? You are nothing we know. Would you stand up for truth? Oh, would you turn over to?
[25:09.000 --> 25:19.000]  And then what if you saw all of the things that's wrong? Would you stand tall and strong? Oh, would you turn it off?
[25:19.000 --> 25:25.000]  I see a message from the government, like every day, I watch it and listen and call them all suckers.
[25:25.000 --> 25:33.000]  They wanted me about a summer or whatever, picture me buying this scam, I said never. You were in boom, drew a hard tooth, soldiers spitting.
[25:33.000 --> 25:41.000]  I stay committed to the values commission. It's all about a fighting devil state, mind control. And all about the battle for your body, mind and soul.
[25:41.000 --> 25:49.000]  And now I'm hoping you don't close your mind so they shape you. Don't forget they made us slaves, gave us days and rapes. Another push sees a mean another war for profit.
[25:49.000 --> 25:57.000]  All the secrets of the public never fit to stop. The Illuminati triple six all connected. So the boats they control the race and take elections.
[25:57.000 --> 26:02.000]  It's the stalling bones, remacing, kill committee. See the dragon get out of the Navy Sea.
[26:02.000 --> 26:12.000]  What does he really good? What are the things we know? Would you stand up or would you turn away?
[26:12.000 --> 26:22.320]  What is wrong? All the black things that's wrong? Would you stand tall and strong? Oh, would you turn it off?
[26:22.320 --> 26:25.000]  Now where so self who's the one with the most to gain?
[26:25.000 --> 26:30.600]  4-9-11-1, couldn't stand his name, not even waving flags like they lost their minds
[26:30.600 --> 26:34.600]  Everybody got opinions, but don't know the time, cause America's been took
[26:34.600 --> 26:38.200]  It's plain to see, the oldest trick in the book is make your enemies
[26:38.200 --> 26:40.600]  A phony evil, so recover, make it do its dirt
[26:40.600 --> 26:43.400]  And take away your freedom, lock and load, keep in search
[26:43.400 --> 26:45.800]  Ain't nothing changed, but more fellow people locked in prison
[26:45.800 --> 26:48.600]  He's been still beaters, where it seems we forgetting
[26:48.600 --> 26:51.400]  But I remember before September how these devils do it
[26:51.400 --> 26:56.600]  Giuliani, Actiolo, how he's doing, we in the streets, how to tell to the people follow
[26:56.600 --> 26:58.600]  Waving flags, bring these dragons to their knees
[26:58.600 --> 27:01.400]  To boil blood money, make these killers rock cold
[27:01.400 --> 27:04.200]  To spit this suicide, people dying never told
[27:04.200 --> 27:07.000]  This all a part of playing cards, so you think we need them
[27:07.000 --> 27:09.800]  While being ass-crossed, take away your rights to freedom
[27:09.800 --> 27:12.200]  Bear witness to the sickness of these dictators
[27:12.200 --> 27:15.000]  Hope you understand the time, brother, cause this makes you
[27:15.000 --> 27:17.800]  Why don't you do it, what you do?
[27:17.800 --> 27:22.600]  What are the things we know, what do you stand up for?
[27:22.600 --> 27:25.400]  What would you turn away to?
[27:25.400 --> 27:27.800]  And what if you don't?
[27:27.800 --> 27:30.600]  What are the things that's wrong?
[27:30.600 --> 27:32.600]  What do you stand up for?
[27:32.600 --> 27:33.400]  What's wrong?
[27:33.400 --> 27:35.400]  What would you turn away to?
[27:35.400 --> 27:38.200]  So now you askin' why my records always come the same
[27:38.200 --> 27:40.600]  Keep it real, ain't no fellas flingin'
[27:40.600 --> 27:43.400]  My eyes see Nagoria, they're comin' up the beast
[27:43.400 --> 27:45.400]  Know every story, every word I'm sayin'
[27:45.400 --> 27:48.600]  Peace, see you co-witness, see your Illuminati body count
[27:48.600 --> 27:51.000]  Don't be surprised, these is devils that I'm talkin' bout
[27:51.000 --> 27:53.000]  You think a couple thousand lies mean
[27:53.000 --> 27:55.000]  The killers, nigga, I swear to God
[27:55.000 --> 27:57.400]  We the ones, ain't no villains, or any other word
[27:57.400 --> 27:59.000]  They think they demonize the country
[27:59.000 --> 28:01.400]  Ain't no terror, threaten, less approval, rating, slumpin'
[28:01.400 --> 28:03.000]  So I'ma say it for the record
[28:03.000 --> 28:04.200]  We the ones that planned it
[28:04.200 --> 28:07.000]  Ain't no other country, took apart, had the hand in
[28:07.000 --> 28:09.400]  Just a way to keep you scary, so you think you need them
[28:09.400 --> 28:11.800]  Praise and butch, why that killer take away your freedom?
[28:11.800 --> 28:15.000]  How many of us got discovered, but ignore the symptoms?
[28:15.000 --> 28:17.000]  Talkin' loud, but ain't nobody sayin'
[28:17.000 --> 28:19.800]  Now with the 4th Amendment going, I got on the 1st
[28:19.800 --> 28:22.600]  That's why I'm spittin' side-night, each and every verse
[28:22.600 --> 28:25.000]  I see the Corleis, Rupert, Harris, bank accounts
[28:25.000 --> 28:27.800]  I see him breathe the fit, teachin' every section now
[28:27.800 --> 28:30.200]  Know why White Stag burns, see the public buy it
[28:30.200 --> 28:33.000]  I see the profile, I see the media's compiling
[28:33.000 --> 28:35.800]  Wars, good for business, see the vicious maker save it
[28:35.800 --> 28:38.200]  Hope you understand the time, rather cuz it's major
[28:38.200 --> 28:41.000]  What would you do with you?
[28:41.000 --> 28:43.400]  There are nothings we know
[28:43.400 --> 28:46.200]  Would you stand up, what's your goal?
[28:46.200 --> 28:48.600]  Would you turn away, too?
[28:48.600 --> 28:52.200]  There ain't no other difference for us all
[28:52.200 --> 28:55.400]  You know, I really ought to take that song out of the rotation lineup
[28:55.400 --> 28:59.000]  Because every time it plays, it's so good
[28:59.000 --> 29:01.400]  So good, even three and a half years of for Paris put it out
[29:01.400 --> 29:04.200]  That I just have to listen to it
[29:04.200 --> 29:07.000]  I know we got James and Avet and Joe and Chris and Ron
[29:07.000 --> 29:09.400]  Everybody else, I will go to you
[29:09.400 --> 29:11.400]  Let me start the next segment
[29:11.400 --> 29:13.800]  And then I will cover Think Tank
[29:13.800 --> 29:16.600]  Israel could attack Iran's nuclear program alone
[29:16.600 --> 29:18.600]  This is out of Herat's
[29:18.600 --> 29:22.600]  Daddy Bush, involved in the JFK assassination
[29:22.600 --> 29:24.600]  Says that it doesn't matter what the public says
[29:24.600 --> 29:27.400]  It doesn't matter if 92% know the government killed him
[29:27.400 --> 29:30.600]  He says what Gerald Ford said at the Warren Commission stands
[29:30.600 --> 29:33.800]  Yeah, keep on dreamin', devil
[29:33.800 --> 29:38.600]  Also, 2006, a deadly year for journalists
[29:38.600 --> 29:41.800]  We'll be covering that report from CBC
[29:41.800 --> 29:44.600]  Also, official held in Saddam hanging video
[29:44.600 --> 29:45.800]  They won't say who
[29:45.800 --> 29:47.400]  If you believe they really arrested somebody
[29:47.400 --> 29:50.600]  They're punishing somebody for that staged video they released
[29:50.600 --> 29:53.000]  I got a bridge, I'll be happy to sell you
[29:53.000 --> 29:57.400]  Also, we will get into what's happening
[29:57.400 --> 30:01.000]  With the former head of the National Hurricane Center now leaving
[30:01.000 --> 30:03.800]  What he's saying for the next hurricane season
[30:03.800 --> 30:07.800]  Also, billionaire boom in China's stock market soared
[30:07.800 --> 30:10.600]  We'll talk some about inflation here in the U.S.
[30:10.600 --> 30:13.000]  How to privatizing law enforcement
[30:13.000 --> 30:17.000]  U.N. staff and accused of raping children in Saddam
[30:17.000 --> 30:18.800]  Toyota, as we told you, is going to put
[30:18.800 --> 30:21.000]  Rethalizers in all their new cars
[30:21.000 --> 30:23.000]  And a lot more coming up
[30:23.000 --> 30:25.000]  Stay with us
[30:25.000 --> 30:27.000]  We're on the march
[30:27.000 --> 30:29.000]  The Empire's on the run
[30:29.000 --> 30:35.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[30:35.000 --> 30:37.800]  The statistics are heart-wrenching
[30:37.800 --> 30:42.200]  According to the CWC of the 43 million people who have served in the major wars
[30:42.200 --> 30:44.600]  From the Revolutionary War to the Gulf War
[30:44.600 --> 30:46.600]  3 million never made it home alive
[30:46.600 --> 30:50.200]  Most likely, each one of us can say we either knew someone who served
[30:50.200 --> 30:53.000]  Or know a great soul who is currently serving our country
[30:53.000 --> 30:56.200]  Now there is a unique way to pay tribute to the courageous men and women
[30:56.200 --> 30:58.200]  Who spend their lives protecting our freedom
[30:58.200 --> 31:00.600]  And to those who have lost their lives doing so
[31:00.600 --> 31:05.000]  Davis Products is offering high-quality, solid-cast aluminum memorial markers

[31:45.600 --> 31:47.600]  You name it, I've tried it
[31:47.600 --> 31:49.600]  My husband has always been a hot sweeper
[31:49.600 --> 31:51.600]  He's never had a good night's sleep

[32:37.600 --> 32:41.600]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson here for the 2007 Red Book
[32:41.600 --> 32:47.600]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year
[32:47.600 --> 32:52.600]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S. dollar can be devalued
[32:52.600 --> 32:57.600]  It may have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits
[32:57.600 --> 33:02.600]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth
[33:02.600 --> 33:06.600]  It is important that you understand the market you are getting into
[33:06.600 --> 33:11.600]  Midas Resources is offering the Red Book and Silver Dollar for only $27.95
[33:11.600 --> 33:15.600]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins
[33:15.600 --> 33:20.600]  Call for your copy today. It's 800-686-2237
[33:20.600 --> 33:24.600]  If you've already accumulated or applied to get into the precious metals market
[33:24.600 --> 33:27.600]  You simply must have the Red Book in your library
[33:27.600 --> 33:53.600]  800-686-2237. That's 1-800-686-2237
[33:58.600 --> 34:05.600]  I wish that I could fly into the sky so very high
[34:05.600 --> 34:08.600]  Just like a dragonfly
[34:12.600 --> 34:17.600]  I fly above the trees, over the seas and on the greens
[34:17.600 --> 34:21.600]  To anywhere I please
[34:21.600 --> 34:26.600]  Oh, I want to get away
[34:26.600 --> 34:30.600]  I'll fly away
[34:30.600 --> 34:35.600]  Welcome back. We're going to go to your phones, calls, jam packs, show today, third hours
[34:35.600 --> 34:37.600]  It's going to be really important to be sure and tune in
[34:37.600 --> 34:41.600]  Let's just get this out of the way right now. This is Seeing It In
[34:41.600 --> 34:44.600]  Last night, it's up on PrisonPlanet.com
[34:44.600 --> 34:49.600]  And the police are the seven cops that shot a bunch of people on a bridge
[34:49.600 --> 34:53.600]  Including people that were supposedly shooting at them
[34:53.600 --> 34:57.600]  We don't even know if that's true though because of the congenital line
[34:57.600 --> 35:02.600]  That's the problem here. I'd like to believe them. Believe me, I like to think we weren't in so much trouble
[35:02.600 --> 35:06.600]  But anyone who tries to defend New Orleans PD is crazy
[35:06.600 --> 35:11.600]  They are the most corrupt police force, hands down in the US
[35:11.600 --> 35:17.600]  But listen to this because then it goes into after they shoot this guy's unarmed retarded brother
[35:17.600 --> 35:21.600]  They're trying to walk out on a highway overpass which were open
[35:21.600 --> 35:23.600]  They just wouldn't let people get out
[35:23.600 --> 35:28.600]  And back behind them, supposedly somebody shoots
[35:28.600 --> 35:31.600]  Probably wasn't, probably was a cop, but you never know
[35:31.600 --> 35:35.600]  We know in some of the other cases, cops were shooting at cops because a cop was shooting an alligator
[35:35.600 --> 35:38.600]  And then cops would hear it and just fire in the general direction
[35:38.600 --> 35:42.600]  I mean, it was bedlam. And look, I expect some of that to happen. I'm not
[35:42.600 --> 35:50.600]  Again, it could have just been negligent homicide or just negligence
[35:50.600 --> 35:59.600]  They'd go get in trouble, sued, whatever, but no, they tried to then frame up the man who was trying to get his retarded brother out
[35:59.600 --> 36:05.600]  And that's what's wrong. I've seen so many squad car videos in so many cases of people I know
[36:05.600 --> 36:09.600]  Where they jerk you out of the car, they rough you up, and then
[36:09.600 --> 36:16.600]  If you even touch them, when they're grabbing on you, let's say you just lean into them or you touch them with your hand
[36:16.600 --> 36:18.600]  Or sometimes you don't even touch them
[36:18.600 --> 36:22.600]  You go limp, they'll still taser you three or four times and claim you assaulted them
[36:22.600 --> 36:25.600]  Until video tape pops up proving it's a fraud
[36:25.600 --> 36:29.600]  And I just, it's this gang mentality and to watch this video
[36:29.600 --> 36:32.600]  All these corrupt New Orleans cops
[36:32.600 --> 36:37.600]  All loving and kissing and hugging on
[36:37.600 --> 36:39.600]  By the seven
[36:39.600 --> 36:44.600]  It's gang mentality, gangs support each other, no matter what
[36:44.600 --> 36:51.600]  And when your police become gangs, biggest and oldest street gang in America, more than one mayor said that
[36:51.600 --> 36:55.600]  Sociologically, this is a fact, you're in deep trouble
[36:55.600 --> 37:01.600]  So, you know, it's only enough they killed this guy's brother in front of him unarmed and they tried to frame him up and put him in prison
[37:01.600 --> 37:05.600]  Until, I guess, good cops spoke out
[37:05.600 --> 37:11.600]  That's like, remember the New York case where they raped the guy for two hours with a toilet plunger?
[37:11.600 --> 37:13.600]  He was bleeding to death
[37:13.600 --> 37:17.600]  And finally, cops moved the whistle and the cops all went after the ones that did that
[37:17.600 --> 37:19.600]  I mean, that's weird
[37:19.600 --> 37:23.600]  And what did the, what did Diallo do? Nothing
[37:23.600 --> 37:29.600]  They later admitted from surveillance camera tapes outside the bar that somebody else punched a cop in the back of the head
[37:29.600 --> 37:34.600]  So they just grabbed the nearest person and drug him off for torture
[37:34.600 --> 37:40.600]  I mean, folks, it's hard to keep your anger up to beat an unarmed person, I would imagine
[37:40.600 --> 37:42.600]  Imagine keeping your anger up
[37:42.600 --> 37:50.600]  You know, I mean, a lot of times, let's say you're getting a fight with somebody and they're hitting you and you hit them and they, you knock them out and their head hits the concrete
[37:50.600 --> 37:56.600]  Most people, even if you've got a good killer instinct, don't start stomping their head
[37:56.600 --> 38:00.600]  Can you imagine stomping for two hours?
[38:00.600 --> 38:04.600]  I mean, again, it shows mental illness
[38:04.600 --> 38:11.600]  It shows a type of savagery to the extreme
[38:11.600 --> 38:14.600]  So let's go ahead and play this clip
[38:14.600 --> 38:22.600]  Shootings in New Orleans in the chaotic days after Katrina, today's seven police officers turning themselves in to face some serious charges
[38:22.600 --> 38:25.600]  Seeing in Sean Caleb's live now from New Orleans
[38:25.600 --> 38:27.600]  Sean
[38:27.600 --> 38:32.600]  Turning exactly six New Orleans police officers, one former New Orleans police officer
[38:32.600 --> 38:35.600]  Turned themselves into the Sheriff's Department here in Orleans Parish
[38:35.600 --> 38:42.600]  They are being processed right now on charges of shooting two men on a bridge in September 4th
[38:42.600 --> 38:45.600]  In those chaotic days right after Hurricane Katrina
[38:45.600 --> 38:51.600]  But the way they turn themselves in really speaks volumes about the way this case is playing out here in New Orleans
[38:51.600 --> 38:57.600]  I want to take you to some pictures, at least 250 perhaps as many as 300 New Orleans police officers lining the road
[38:57.600 --> 39:00.600]  Greeting the Danzinger 7 as they are now known
[39:00.600 --> 39:02.600]  The shooting took place on the Danzinger Bridge
[39:02.600 --> 39:05.600]  As the seven people made their way to the Sheriff's office
[39:05.600 --> 39:10.600]  They were greeted by cheers, applause, and chants of N-O-P-D
[39:10.600 --> 39:17.600]  But what happened on that day still remains bitterly contested among the two sides
[39:17.600 --> 39:22.600]  The police saying that they were answering a call that an officer was down when they arrived at the bridge
[39:22.600 --> 39:27.600]  They said there was shooting going on, that is when they shot and killed two people
[39:27.600 --> 39:34.600]  The police, however, later on it was determined the indictments were handed up just this past Thursday
[39:34.600 --> 39:37.600]  But when asked about this show of support out here on the street today
[39:37.600 --> 39:40.600]  We couldn't get any of the New Orleans police officers to speak with us
[39:40.600 --> 39:46.600]  They were all tight-lipped, but we did get an officer from another unit
[39:46.600 --> 39:51.600]  Some with another department, but I'm glad to support the officer because it happened to one of us
[39:51.600 --> 39:53.600]  It happened to me
[39:53.600 --> 39:59.600]  Now four of the officers are charged with first-degree murder, three are charged with attempted murder
[39:59.600 --> 40:03.600]  They are going to be in jail here until at least Friday
[40:03.600 --> 40:08.600]  That is when the various attorneys representing the officers say they hope to have a bond hearing
[40:08.600 --> 40:14.600]  Now there is a civil suit pending against the city, the officers as well involved in this shooting
[40:14.600 --> 40:19.600]  The Reverend Al Sharpen has actually said that the shooting is racially motivated
[40:19.600 --> 40:23.600]  Despite the fact that four of the officers involved are African-American
[40:23.600 --> 40:29.600]  When we talked to some of the attorneys involved in the case, they said they are simply dumbfounded by that accusation
[40:29.600 --> 40:34.600]  Four of the seven officers
[40:34.600 --> 40:39.600]  The Reverend Sharpen can't count or he can't do it
[40:39.600 --> 40:48.600]  Now the two people who were killed, 19-year-old James Brissette and also Ronald Madison who was 40
[40:48.600 --> 40:50.600]  Ronald Madison is mentally retarded
[40:50.600 --> 40:55.600]  His brother was arrested and charged in that incident as well
[40:55.600 --> 40:57.600]  He was held for about 26 days
[40:57.600 --> 41:01.600]  He is now the individual pursuing the civil charge against the city
[41:01.600 --> 41:07.600]  The attorney that charges against the six officers and one former officer do carry heavy sentences
[41:07.600 --> 41:13.600]  If they aren't convicted including the possibility of the death sentence for four of those people involved in this
[41:13.600 --> 41:14.600]  Tony?
[41:14.600 --> 41:17.600]  Boy, a strange set of circumstances there on the ground in New Orleans
[41:17.600 --> 41:19.600]  Sean Kalos for us, I appreciate it
[41:19.600 --> 41:27.600]  So, look, bad things happen when you've got total breakdown of society in Bedlam
[41:27.600 --> 41:29.600]  And there were being shots fired from somewhere
[41:29.600 --> 41:33.600]  These police behaving like complete goons
[41:33.600 --> 41:36.600]  They could have shot cops from the other side of the bridge
[41:36.600 --> 41:39.600]  Should be fired
[41:39.600 --> 41:44.600]  And they shouldn't have just sprayed a crowd of people with bullets, that's what happened
[41:44.600 --> 41:46.600]  But they panicked
[41:46.600 --> 41:51.600]  Now, they should not be being charged with first degree murder
[41:51.600 --> 41:54.600]  I mean, that means premeditated
[41:54.600 --> 42:01.600]  Now, obviously, it's not premeditated in a passionate combat situation
[42:01.600 --> 42:05.600]  Are they going to start charging our troops in friendly fire?
[42:05.600 --> 42:07.600]  Incidents?
[42:07.600 --> 42:11.600]  But, at the same time, they are a bunch of dirty gang members
[42:11.600 --> 42:13.600]  You ought to go watch the video of it
[42:13.600 --> 42:16.600]  It's like it's a carnival celebration atmosphere
[42:16.600 --> 42:19.600]  They still behave in a shameful fashion
[42:19.600 --> 42:22.600]  And they should be criminally charged
[42:22.600 --> 42:25.600]  Because I went and pulled the case up
[42:25.600 --> 42:28.600]  They tried to claim it first
[42:28.600 --> 42:32.600]  When they took the brother, who just lost his brother, who was unarmed into custody
[42:32.600 --> 42:36.600]  That he was shooting at cops, he had no weapon
[42:36.600 --> 42:40.600]  Then they dropped that and claimed he assaulted officers
[42:40.600 --> 42:43.600]  I mean, you got a lot of nerve, man, you blew this guy's brother away
[42:43.600 --> 42:45.600]  And then you tried to frame him?
[42:45.600 --> 42:47.600]  That's why the cops need to go to prison
[42:47.600 --> 42:50.600]  Whoever filed those reports
[42:50.600 --> 42:54.600]  I mean, I've seen police and detectives
[42:54.600 --> 42:57.600]  And they've been caught all over the country, sent innocent people to prison
[42:57.600 --> 43:01.600]  Man, we got lives, we're just as good and just as important as you
[43:01.600 --> 43:07.600]  I mean, you think we deserve to just be lied about and sent to prison?
[43:07.600 --> 43:09.600]  Remember the case in Midland, Texas
[43:09.600 --> 43:12.600]  Where they came in with two armored vehicles from two different sides
[43:12.600 --> 43:14.600]  And the police entered on two different sides of the house
[43:14.600 --> 43:17.600]  And one of them opened fire, he tripped and opened fire
[43:17.600 --> 43:19.600]  So they shot one of their own cops in the back
[43:19.600 --> 43:23.600]  So they went nuts and shot the unarmed man in the house, what, three times?
[43:23.600 --> 43:27.600]  And then they're talking about framing him on the tape
[43:27.600 --> 43:31.600]  And then finally one of the outside responding officers went public
[43:31.600 --> 43:33.600]  And said, I'm not going to be part of this
[43:33.600 --> 43:35.600]  And the reason, he said he was going to keep quiet
[43:35.600 --> 43:40.600]  But they were trying to frame the guy who was having a domestic disturbance
[43:40.600 --> 43:42.600]  With shooting their own officer and killing him
[43:42.600 --> 43:46.600]  And then they warned another
[43:46.600 --> 43:50.600]  That's the scary part, these untrained, idiot SWAT teams
[43:50.600 --> 43:54.600]  Most of them military wash-ups in these mid-sized towns
[43:54.600 --> 43:57.600]  They've got some professionals in bigger cities sometimes
[43:57.600 --> 44:01.600]  They will come out to your house for whatever reason
[44:01.600 --> 44:03.600]  Or the wrong house, you see that every week
[44:03.600 --> 44:05.600]  You know, the wrong house, old lady
[44:05.600 --> 44:09.600]  And then they'll bust in your house unannounced
[44:09.600 --> 44:11.600]  And they'll start shooting themselves
[44:11.600 --> 44:13.600]  And then they'll, we got a case of that in Austin
[44:13.600 --> 44:17.600]  Where the evidence clearly shows they shot their own officer in the back entering
[44:17.600 --> 44:21.600]  So they went ahead and just tried to frame the guy in the house
[44:21.600 --> 44:27.600]  I mean, it really starts getting old
[44:27.600 --> 44:30.600]  They look at us like we're all criminals
[44:30.600 --> 44:32.600]  And like we have no due process
[44:32.600 --> 44:35.600]  And this is what television and shows like COPS have done
[44:35.600 --> 44:38.600]  On COPS, they only show white trash or trashy people
[44:38.600 --> 44:43.600]  Everybody's always guilty 95% of the time on the show
[44:43.600 --> 44:46.600]  I know because I almost made a film about propaganda
[44:46.600 --> 44:49.600]  The police state just decided it wasn't the most important thing to do
[44:49.600 --> 44:53.600]  A few years ago, so I was taping COPS and researching it and analyzing it
[44:53.600 --> 44:55.600]  Somebody else ought to go with the idea
[44:55.600 --> 44:57.600]  So I did make a study of it
[44:57.600 --> 45:02.600]  And it shows the image of a whole bunch of toothless, bearded, stumbling drunks
[45:02.600 --> 45:05.600]  Who beat our wives and the COPS are always good
[45:05.600 --> 45:10.600]  And it just shows the public and they violate people's rights on these COPS shows
[45:10.600 --> 45:15.600]  Then they got shows like 24 where they tortured children or innocent people every episode
[45:15.600 --> 45:20.600]  And then the Homeland Security even has C-SPAN broadcasts bragging and thanking 24
[45:20.600 --> 45:22.600]  For molding public opinion
[45:22.600 --> 45:25.600]  I mean, we told you years ago they were molding public opinion
[45:25.600 --> 45:28.600]  But now they admit they are
[45:28.600 --> 45:31.600]  This is brainwashing
[45:31.600 --> 45:35.600]  Statistically, historically, the most dangerous thing is government
[45:35.600 --> 45:44.600]  Because once it goes bad, it can unabashedly be turned loose on a mass scale to engage in mass crimes
[45:44.600 --> 45:48.600]  But in today's society, the common wisdom is
[45:48.600 --> 45:50.600]  The common sense is the opposite
[45:50.600 --> 45:54.600]  It's just trust government, let it breathe in the dark, let it do whatever it wants
[45:54.600 --> 45:56.600]  And let's just all go to sleep
[46:00.600 --> 46:02.600]  Well, I'm not going to be part of it
[46:02.600 --> 46:06.600]  So I'm not indicting police your individual selves
[46:06.600 --> 46:09.600]  I know most of you are good people, you've got a tough job
[46:09.600 --> 46:11.600]  Frankly, I wouldn't take it
[46:11.600 --> 46:15.600]  It's about a thousand dollars a year on average to hang your hind ends out
[46:15.600 --> 46:19.600]  On major interstate highways, riding people tickets
[46:19.600 --> 46:21.600]  Go look at the statistics, by the way, officers
[46:21.600 --> 46:23.600]  You're so scared to death of citizens and guns
[46:23.600 --> 46:26.600]  You better be scared of car wrecks, that's how most of you die
[46:26.600 --> 46:28.600]  Then next it's your own officer shooting you
[46:28.600 --> 46:32.600]  And then it's citizens shooting you or stabbing you
[46:32.600 --> 46:34.600]  Or running over you
[46:37.600 --> 46:39.600]  I mean, you've got a thankless job
[46:39.600 --> 46:41.600]  It's some wonderful thing
[46:41.600 --> 46:44.600]  And I'm just going to please realize you've been brainwashed
[46:44.600 --> 46:48.600]  Okay, that's all I'm asking you to be honest with yourselves
[46:48.600 --> 46:50.600]  And look at what your profession has turned into
[46:50.600 --> 46:55.600]  Always a dangerous thing to have any type of organized government force
[46:55.600 --> 46:59.600]  It almost always goes bad, and it's certainly gone bad here
[46:59.600 --> 47:03.600]  So I try to really balance things and really give you my honest opinion
[47:03.600 --> 47:08.600]  I don't think these police should be charged with first degree murder
[47:08.600 --> 47:10.600]  First degree murder, it's no
[47:10.600 --> 47:15.600]  They didn't all get out and say, let's go out today and shoot a couple black guys
[47:15.600 --> 47:17.600]  When four of them were black
[47:17.600 --> 47:20.600]  I mean, Reverend Al Sharpton, what are blacks going to figure out?
[47:20.600 --> 47:25.600]  People like him, there are so many well-spoken, intelligent, focused, balanced black leaders
[47:25.600 --> 47:28.600]  But they never give them a platform
[47:28.600 --> 47:32.600]  It's always Al Sharpton who acts like a clown to make you look stupid
[47:32.600 --> 47:36.600]  So when there is real racism, there's plenty of that going on
[47:36.600 --> 47:39.600]  And in discrimination, people won't listen next time
[47:39.600 --> 47:44.600]  Because they've heard Al Sharpton say four black cops shot two black people
[47:44.600 --> 47:47.600]  Because they didn't like blacks
[47:47.600 --> 47:49.600]  Just ridiculous
[47:49.600 --> 47:52.600]  And again, it's a petty issue in the scheme of the whole world
[47:52.600 --> 47:54.600]  But it's an educational microcosm
[47:54.600 --> 47:56.600]  James in Texas, then a vet and others
[47:56.600 --> 47:58.600]  Go ahead, James
[47:58.600 --> 47:59.600]  Mr. Jones
[47:59.600 --> 48:00.600]  Yes, sir
[48:00.600 --> 48:02.600]  First and foremost, treasurer's pet tart
[48:02.600 --> 48:04.600]  Sorry about the red eye
[48:04.600 --> 48:06.600]  Okay
[48:06.600 --> 48:07.600]  What's on your mind, sir?
[48:07.600 --> 48:12.600]  When and if are you going to be up to par with the Howard Sterns of the world?
[48:12.600 --> 48:15.600]  Are you on satellite and all that?
[48:15.600 --> 48:22.600]  I'm on satellites to deliver radio to our affiliates
[48:22.600 --> 48:24.600]  And sir, I appreciate your call
[48:24.600 --> 48:27.600]  But I just don't even want to get into the edge of profanity there
[48:27.600 --> 48:32.600]  And I appreciate your support in wanting to get me on Sirius or XM
[48:32.600 --> 48:34.600]  We have approached them for years
[48:34.600 --> 48:36.600]  We have had them approach us first
[48:36.600 --> 48:39.600]  Because, you know, the vice presidents and people know this would be good
[48:39.600 --> 48:42.600]  This would get them a lot of subscribers
[48:42.600 --> 48:46.600]  I mean, both what Sirius has got like four million XMs
[48:46.600 --> 48:48.600]  Got like four and a half million or something
[48:48.600 --> 48:53.600]  Last time I checked subscribers, it's losing a lot of money
[48:53.600 --> 48:55.600]  And this network's got more listeners
[48:55.600 --> 48:58.600]  Via AM and FM internet, shortwave satellite
[48:58.600 --> 49:02.600]  When we subscribe to Arbitron, the network gets the numbers
[49:02.600 --> 49:05.600]  We have more than Sirius
[49:05.600 --> 49:09.600]  We don't have more than Sirius and XM combined
[49:09.600 --> 49:13.600]  So certainly they would get hundreds of thousands of subscribers in a year or so
[49:13.600 --> 49:18.600]  If they put this show or say all Genesis programming on a feed
[49:18.600 --> 49:22.600]  But that gets off into the whole radio business and how that works
[49:22.600 --> 49:28.600]  Clear Channel, now being merged with an investment company connected to Carl Algrove
[49:28.600 --> 49:34.600]  And Westwood, One, CBS, ABC, Jones
[49:34.600 --> 49:39.600]  Those are the four big names in Glamourance
[49:39.600 --> 49:45.600]  And they own most of the programming that you hear on Sirius and XM
[49:45.600 --> 49:48.600]  And by the way, they're in talks to Merge right now
[49:48.600 --> 49:51.600]  The desperate bid to not bankrupt
[49:51.600 --> 49:55.600]  They're out of this division, the particular division they've launched
[49:55.600 --> 49:58.600]  The division we're talking about
[49:58.600 --> 50:02.600]  And you can talk for hours about radio and how it works
[50:02.600 --> 50:06.600]  So it isn't just...
[50:06.600 --> 50:09.600]  There's an oligopoly
[50:09.600 --> 50:11.600]  You know, stations that want to carry this show
[50:11.600 --> 50:13.600]  So they don't have to wait six months a year until their contract's up
[50:13.600 --> 50:15.600]  Because to carry one show they want
[50:15.600 --> 50:18.600]  With one of these big networks, they've got to carry three or four others they don't want
[50:18.600 --> 50:21.600]  So that's meant to monopolize stations they don't own
[50:21.600 --> 50:26.600]  But then they still, these working Glamourance, own most of the stations
[50:26.600 --> 50:29.600]  And so, yeah, we've been contacted by them
[50:29.600 --> 50:33.600]  Oh, we want to pick you up and then higher-ups put the kibosh on it
[50:33.600 --> 50:37.600]  So that's how that works
[50:37.600 --> 50:39.600]  But overall, it doesn't really matter
[50:39.600 --> 50:41.600]  They're launching more satellites all the time
[50:41.600 --> 50:44.600]  There's going to be two or three new satellites
[50:44.600 --> 50:47.600]  Supplying, they're talking about the next few years
[50:47.600 --> 50:51.600]  The basic receivers that are a lot cheaper built into your CD player
[50:51.600 --> 50:53.600]  Or your MP3 player being in your car
[50:53.600 --> 50:58.600]  Or you just set your wireless internet that will be in your standard player in your car
[50:58.600 --> 51:02.600]  That when you pull up at your house to download it off your PC inside
[51:02.600 --> 51:06.600]  The podcast of this show
[51:06.600 --> 51:08.600]  And then you got it and listen to it whenever you want
[51:08.600 --> 51:11.600]  By the way, free podcast every day at the end of the show

[51:29.600 --> 51:54.600]  I will come back, take more calls, get into more industry with me
[51:59.600 --> 52:06.600]  And I'll see you in the next one
[52:30.600 --> 52:38.600]  Celebrating 18 years of dedication
[52:38.600 --> 52:42.600]  It's here after a year in production traveling the distant lands
[52:42.600 --> 52:44.600]  My new film Terror Storm is complete
[52:44.600 --> 52:49.600]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks
[52:49.600 --> 52:52.600]  Against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them
[52:52.600 --> 52:56.600]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job
[52:56.600 --> 53:00.600]  But the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence
[53:00.600 --> 53:03.600]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran
[53:03.600 --> 53:06.600]  A White House program to disseminate fake news
[53:06.600 --> 53:12.600]  NSA spy, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more
[53:12.600 --> 53:15.600]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government sponsored terror
[53:15.600 --> 53:18.600]  It's an anthology of government crimes
[53:18.600 --> 53:22.600]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see

[53:43.600 --> 53:44.600]  Yeah
[53:44.600 --> 53:46.600]  Honey, is there something wrong?
[53:46.600 --> 53:50.600]  Yeah, I just realized we forgot to pack the travel perky system
[53:50.600 --> 53:54.600]  We can't drink this cabin water, and what am I going to do when I'm out on the lake?
[53:54.600 --> 53:56.600]  Now the whole vacation is ruined
[53:56.600 --> 54:00.600]  Honey, cheer up, I brought our sport perky purifiers
[54:00.600 --> 54:01.600]  What?
[54:01.600 --> 54:08.600]  Yeah, I know you're picky about not having pathogenic bacteria, organic chemicals, heavy metals or foul tastes, and odors in the water
[54:08.600 --> 54:11.600]  So I packed our sport perky purifiers

[54:40.600 --> 54:42.600]  This song is dedicated to Paul Watson
[54:42.600 --> 54:49.600]  In 1814 we took a little trip along the Colonel Jackson down the mighty Mississippi
[54:49.600 --> 54:55.600]  We took a little bacon and we took a little beans and we caught the bloody British in a town in New Orleans
[54:55.600 --> 54:58.600]  We fired our guns and the British kept for coming
[54:58.600 --> 55:00.600]  There wasn't as many as there was a while ago
[55:00.600 --> 55:03.600]  We fired once more and they'd begin to run in
[55:03.600 --> 55:06.600]  On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
[55:06.600 --> 55:10.600]  We looked down the river and we'd see the British come
[55:10.600 --> 55:13.600]  And there must have been a hundred of them beating on the drums
[55:13.600 --> 55:16.600]  They stepped so high and they made the bugles ring
[55:16.600 --> 55:18.600]  We stood beside our cotton fields and didn't say a thing
[55:18.600 --> 55:21.600]  We fired our guns and the British kept for coming
[55:21.600 --> 55:24.600]  There wasn't as many as there was a while ago
[55:24.600 --> 55:26.600]  We fired once more and they'd begin to run in
[55:26.600 --> 55:29.600]  On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
[55:29.600 --> 55:33.600]  We looked down the river and we'd see the British come
[55:33.600 --> 55:36.600]  And there must have been a hundred of them beating on the drums
[55:36.600 --> 55:39.600]  There wasn't as many as there was a while ago
[55:39.600 --> 55:42.600]  We fired once more and they'd begin to run in
[55:42.600 --> 55:45.600]  On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
[55:45.600 --> 55:48.600]  We looked down the river and we'd see the British come
[55:48.600 --> 55:51.600]  And there must have been a hundred of them beating on the drums
[55:51.600 --> 55:54.600]  They stepped so high and they made the bugles ring
[55:54.600 --> 55:57.600]  There wasn't as many as there was a while ago
[55:57.600 --> 55:59.600]  I said I would
[55:59.600 --> 56:05.600]  I've been meaning to plug the fact that we have a free podcast
[56:05.600 --> 56:09.600]  And tens of thousands of people, yes tens of thousands
[56:09.600 --> 56:12.600]  Are taking advantage of it and I want tens of thousands more
[56:12.600 --> 56:15.600]  Just tell your whole email list, tell your message board
[56:15.600 --> 56:17.600]  Tell your web space, tell everybody
[56:17.600 --> 56:19.600]  I'm asking everybody out there
[56:19.600 --> 56:21.600]  We're paying for it
[56:21.600 --> 56:23.600]  I just want to fight the new world order
[56:23.600 --> 56:26.600]  And we can circumvent the censors and all the rest of them
[56:26.600 --> 56:30.600]  It's free, listen to it how you want, when you want, where you want
[56:30.600 --> 56:32.600]  And if you want to finance our little operation
[56:32.600 --> 56:35.600]  Why don't you go buy some of the DVDs and books and videos
[56:35.600 --> 56:37.600]  I've made, I've written that we carry
[56:37.600 --> 56:40.600]  Up on infowars.com
[56:40.600 --> 56:43.600]  Or prisonplanet.com or call toll free to get my films
[56:43.600 --> 56:45.600]  8 to 8 to 8
[56:45.600 --> 56:47.600]  253-3139
[56:47.600 --> 56:50.600]  Let's go ahead and talk to a vet in New Jersey, a vet
[56:50.600 --> 56:51.600]  Thanks for holding
[56:51.600 --> 56:53.600]  Happy New Year, Alex
[56:53.600 --> 56:55.600]  Yeah, 2007, we made it this far
[56:55.600 --> 56:57.600]  Yeah, that's true
[56:57.600 --> 57:00.600]  Well, I have three quick questions to ask you
[57:00.600 --> 57:03.600]  Do you know when they're going to be voting on the hate crime bill
[57:03.600 --> 57:05.600]  Because I really would like to contact them
[57:05.600 --> 57:07.600]  That could be as early as next week
[57:07.600 --> 57:08.600]  Next week?
[57:08.600 --> 57:11.600]  Yeah, we barely beat it last year in the last session
[57:11.600 --> 57:14.600]  Now the Democrats are there, Bush says they'll sign it
[57:14.600 --> 57:17.600]  And oh, by the way, they have a new hate bill
[57:17.600 --> 57:19.600]  That they've been introducing every year, Nadler
[57:19.600 --> 57:21.600]  But now it's like Nadler can get it passed
[57:21.600 --> 57:24.600]  Where if you just say anything that hurts someone's feelings
[57:24.600 --> 57:26.600]  And the federal law for our public schools
[57:26.600 --> 57:28.600]  To get our children into the system
[57:28.600 --> 57:30.600]  And now I'm getting emails that I'm a hater
[57:30.600 --> 57:33.600]  No, I'm for the First Amendment, ladies and gentlemen
[57:33.600 --> 57:35.600]  And yeah, we're in a lot of trouble
[57:35.600 --> 57:39.600]  Oh, man, okay, well, I'm definitely going to contact my representatives about it
[57:39.600 --> 57:43.600]  Also, near the end of last year, you had a gentleman on your show
[57:43.600 --> 57:45.600]  Name Aaron Russo
[57:45.600 --> 57:48.600]  And referring to the New World Order, the North American Union
[57:48.600 --> 57:50.600]  He said we could talk all day about the problem
[57:50.600 --> 57:52.600]  But what we need to do is formulate an action plan
[57:52.600 --> 57:54.600]  I've been trying to get Aaron on again
[57:54.600 --> 57:56.600]  I don't want to say too much
[57:56.600 --> 57:58.600]  He's not feeling too well
[57:58.600 --> 58:00.600]  And I'll leave it at that
[58:00.600 --> 58:02.600]  But he's getting better and we should have him on soon
[58:02.600 --> 58:04.600]  You want to get down to brass tacks
[58:04.600 --> 58:08.600]  I'm scheduled to actually face-to-face interview him
[58:08.600 --> 58:11.600]  In the next few days, I'll just leave it at that
[58:11.600 --> 58:14.600]  Okay, I hope he feels better
[58:14.600 --> 58:16.600]  A lot of people, everybody goes to infoawards.com
[58:16.600 --> 58:18.600]  And buys his great film
[58:18.600 --> 58:21.600]  Marry him to fascism, his work is very important
[58:21.600 --> 58:22.600]  Very good
[58:22.600 --> 58:24.600]  Say you went to a shelter
[58:24.600 --> 58:25.600]  This is my last question
[58:25.600 --> 58:27.600]  Say you went to a shelter and you fell in love with the cat
[58:27.600 --> 58:29.600]  And you decided to adopt it
[58:29.600 --> 58:32.600]  But then you found out the cat has a microchip in it
[58:32.600 --> 58:35.600]  Is there a procedure to get the microchip out of the cat?
[58:35.600 --> 58:38.600]  Well, if the microchip itself isn't some evil thing
[58:38.600 --> 58:40.600]  It's that they want to use it to track humans
[58:40.600 --> 58:43.600]  And RFID to track all the products
[58:43.600 --> 58:45.600]  And that's the real evil
[58:45.600 --> 58:47.600]  But if you like the cat, I mean, I'm sure you...
[58:47.600 --> 58:49.600]  I don't think you'd be able to get a vet to take the chip out
[58:49.600 --> 58:53.600]  Because they'd say it wasn't needed as a procedure
[58:53.600 --> 58:55.600]  They've tried to pass laws and have it
[58:55.600 --> 58:57.600]  Many states and cities that if you want to adopt
[58:57.600 --> 58:58.600]  It has to have a chip
[58:58.600 --> 58:59.600]  No!
[58:59.600 --> 59:01.600]  Passing laws that all animals have to have chips
[59:01.600 --> 59:02.600]  And that is wrong
[59:02.600 --> 59:03.600]  Yeah
[59:03.600 --> 59:05.600]  Well, I think if you want the little kitty cat
[59:05.600 --> 59:07.600]  You know, do what you want there
[59:07.600 --> 59:09.600]  I don't think it'll be some great blast for me
[59:09.600 --> 59:11.600]  The technology itself isn't evil
[59:11.600 --> 59:12.600]  It's how it's being implemented
[59:12.600 --> 59:23.600]  We'll be right back
[59:42.600 --> 59:44.600]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult
[01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:17.600]  That's 888-803-4438
[01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:43.600]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com
[01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:52.600]  And now, live from Austin, Texas
[01:00:52.600 --> 01:01:10.600]  Alex Jones
[01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:12.600]  Now into hour number two
[01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:15.600]  On this third day of January 2007
[01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:17.600]  I was starting to get used to that
[01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:19.600]  By the time I get accustomed
[01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:22.600]  It'll be 2008
[01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:23.600]  Let's go back to your calls
[01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:25.600]  And then I'm going to get into Israel's saying
[01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:26.600]  They may go ahead
[01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:28.600]  Their top think tank has advised them in the past
[01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:30.600]  They can go ahead and go along with Iran
[01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:32.600]  What Bush senior said yesterday
[01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:34.600]  Confirmed about the JFK assassination
[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:36.600]  Some other key audio clips
[01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:38.600]  And three different guests coming up
[01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:40.600]  We're going to give you an update from the FEMA camp
[01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:41.600]  North of Austin
[01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:43.600]  With the men that were there yesterday
[01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:45.600]  Aaron Dykes and Kevin Smith
[01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:48.600]  Right now, let's go ahead and go to Joe
[01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:50.600]  Joe, where are you calling me from today?
[01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:51.600]  Hey, Alex
[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:53.600]  I'm up in Pittsburgh
[01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:54.600]  Pittsburgh, alright
[01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:56.600]  What's going on, my stealer?
[01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:57.600]  Well, my man
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:01:59.600]  I actually called you on Friday
[01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:02.600]  For your last 2006 broadcast
[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:04.600]  Yes
[01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:06.600]  And so we had a good little talk
[01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:09.600]  However, after we hung up
[01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:11.600]  I think I was a little bit misconstrued
[01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:13.600]  By the caller after me
[01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:14.600]  Well, I don't remember
[01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:16.600]  Refresh my feeble memory
[01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:19.600]  Well, he said his name was Dino from Oregon
[01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:22.600]  And I had mentioned it in my call
[01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:23.600]  Oh, I remember now
[01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:25.600]  But I defended you
[01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:27.600]  I just think Dino was mad about the state of events
[01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:28.600]  And he just
[01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:30.600]  You were saying you're a musician
[01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:32.600]  You want to have some events
[01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:34.600]  Up in Pittsburgh on 9-11
[01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:36.600]  You'd like to have me up there
[01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:38.600]  And then he kind of had
[01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:40.600]  And said something a little nasty
[01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:42.600]  But I think that was just a mood
[01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:44.600]  I don't think I was construing
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:46.600]  You trying to
[01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:48.600]  No, not you, him
[01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:50.600]  Don't worry, I'm for Dino
[01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:52.600]  We'll call in now
[01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:54.600]  Yeah, well, thanks for defending me
[01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:56.600]  Dino mentioned that he was
[01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:58.600]  Listening to your show for six years
[01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:00.600]  I've only been listening to your show for six months
[01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:02.600]  And I'm trying to put something together
[01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:03.600]  To get people informed
[01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:05.600]  I just had a quick question for him
[01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:06.600]  If he does call in
[01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:07.600]  What has he done
[01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:09.600]  To try to help the movement
[01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:11.600]  That's secondary
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:13.600]  To the reason why I called again
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:15.600]  I became a gun owner on Friday
[01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:17.600]  For the first time
[01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:19.600]  After we spoke on the phone
[01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:20.600]  We went to the gun store
[01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:21.600]  My girlfriend and I
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:23.600]  And bought ourselves a shotgun here
[01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:24.600]  Good
[01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:26.600]  To protect the home front
[01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:29.600]  Have you ever fired a firearm before?
[01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:31.600]  Yeah, I've fired firearms
[01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:33.600]  In the past few years
[01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:35.600]  Well, it's totally worth it
[01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:37.600]  To talk to a local shooting range
[01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:39.600]  And ask who their best
[01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:40.600]  Their best teacher is
[01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:42.600]  And you may have to go out to a skeet range
[01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:43.600]  Of the shotgun
[01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:45.600]  But I'd take a couple of lessons
[01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:47.600]  And then I'd go out and practice yourself
[01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:49.600]  Because it's a...
[01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:51.600]  With great power comes great responsibility
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:53.600]  As Spider-Man's uncle says
[01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:55.600]  Exactly
[01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:58.600]  Because I advise everybody to buy firearms
[01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:00.600]  But stow them properly
[01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:02.600]  And learn how to use them
[01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:04.600]  And I've been shooting since I'm knee-high
[01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:05.600]  To a grasshopper
[01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:07.600]  And I still get out amongst people who are
[01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:09.600]  Veterans and really good with guns
[01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:12.600]  And they still don't follow proper procedures
[01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:14.600]  And so I don't want to get people killed out there
[01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:16.600]  But I do think everybody needs guns
[01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:18.600]  But just be careful with them
[01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:20.600]  Exactly
[01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:22.600]  Just one more thing I wanted to add also
[01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:24.600]  Was that
[01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:26.600]  I think the whole truth movement
[01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:28.600]  As I call it is kind of
[01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:30.600]  I don't know, disorganized
[01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:32.600]  And...
[01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:35.600]  But in a way that's good
[01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:36.600]  Everybody's always saying
[01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:37.600]  We've got to be organized
[01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:38.600]  We've got to be organized
[01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:40.600]  And I think we need organizing thoughts
[01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:42.600]  And organizing manifesto
[01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:44.600]  Organized
[01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:46.600]  Music
[01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:48.600]  A sheet of music we're playing off of here
[01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:50.600]  But
[01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:53.600]  I really think it makes us unstoppable
[01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:55.600]  That we're roving wolf packs here
[01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:57.600]  And lone wolves
[01:04:57.600 --> 01:04:59.600]  That really makes us hard to penetrate and stop
[01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:01.600]  I'd like to try to send you
[01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:03.600]  At least a clip from
[01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:05.600]  A song that my girlfriend and I
[01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:07.600]  We've been writing some new songs here
[01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:08.600]  Stay there
[01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:09.600]  We'll let you finish up
[01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:10.600]  We'll talk about
[01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:12.600]  Consolidated Resistance
[01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:14.600]  Versus Wolf Packs
[01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:16.600]  On the other side
[01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:17.600]  I'm Alex Jones
[01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:20.600]  It is the GCN Radio Network
[01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:22.600]  This is Wolf Pack
[01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:24.600]  Leader Jones
[01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:26.600]  From FEMA Sector 10
[01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:28.600]  We'll be right back
[01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:31.600]  Music
[01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:37.600]  It's here after a year in production
[01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:39.600]  Travelling to distant lands
[01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:41.600]  My new film Terror Storm is complete
[01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:43.600]  Shocking, declassified government documents
[01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:45.600]  Prove that western governments are orchestrating
[01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:47.600]  Terror attacks against their own populations
[01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:49.600]  As a pretext to enslave them
[01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:52.600]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11
[01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:53.600]  An inside job
[01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:55.600]  But the attacks of 7-7 in London
[01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:57.600]  Were carried out by British intelligence
[01:05:57.600 --> 01:05:59.600]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies
[01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:01.600]  That took us to war in Iraq
[01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:03.600]  A White House program to disseminate fake news
[01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:04.600]  NSA spying
[01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:06.600]  Secret police torture
[01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:08.600]  The latest 9-11 information
[01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:09.600]  And much, much more
[01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:11.600]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide
[01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:13.600]  To the history of government-sponsored terrorism
[01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:15.600]  It's an anthology of government crimes
[01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:17.600]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone
[01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:19.600]  Who wants to be truly informed must see

[01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:32.560]  3-8 or order online at BerkeyWater.com.
[01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:33.560]  It's a fact.
[01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:37.240]  You can legally eliminate credit card debt, which has been fraudulently created by the
[01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:38.240]  banks.
[01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:43.200]  Since its creation in 1913, the Federal Reserve has not been held responsible for its own
[01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:44.200]  debt.
[01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:47.200]  So why should you, the hardworking American, be harassed for yours?
[01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:50.520]  There's a double standard when it comes to being responsible for debt, and unlike the
[01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:54.600]  Federal Reserve, the people of this country can't print more money when needed.
[01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:59.560]  Day of Jubilee has created a successful program designed for people that want to stop harassing
[01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:02.240]  calls and threatening letters from bill collectors.
[01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:04.440]  We also do credit restoration.
[01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:09.080]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe a sigh of relief because they have legally
[01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:11.040]  eliminated their credit card debt.
[01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:15.160]  Instead of living each day in fear, it's time to turn your life around.
[01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:16.720]  Call Day of Jubilee.
[01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:23.840]  Open 9am to 5pm Central Standard Time at 9202938024.
[01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:29.000]  And ask for Robert.
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:37.720]  Don't wait any longer to get your life back in order.
[01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:38.720]  Big Brother.
[01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:40.720]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:41.720]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:42.720]  You want answers?
[01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:43.720]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:49.840]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:59.840]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:08.640]  I'm going to go back to Joe and Pittsburgh in a minute.
[01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:15.720]  He was talking about organizing versus not being organized against the New World Order.
[01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:19.080]  And it's a very complex issue, and I've really studied it, and I want to try to spend a few
[01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:20.080]  minutes laying that out.
[01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:22.880]  I'm going to go to Chris and John and many others that are patiently holding.
[01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:26.640]  Coming up in about 25 minutes, we've got Kevin Smith and Aaron Dykes here in studio
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:30.920]  to talk about the FEMA camp north of Austin and Taylor that visited yesterday.
[01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:34.920]  We were up here until about one in the morning last night working on that report in between
[01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:37.880]  working on the new film to be putting that out for free.
[01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:41.480]  A lot of our reports we put out for free on Google Video, but about half of them aren't
[01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:42.480]  free.
[01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:45.640]  We put them up on PrismPlanet.tv for members.
[01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:51.360]  Let's go ahead, though, and go to a surprise call, Jack McClam, who's here on the Genesis
[01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:56.280]  Network every night at 7 o'clock central, most highly decorated police officer in Phoenix,
[01:09:56.280 --> 01:10:03.720]  Arizona history, what cop of the year twice, I guess, and also a Vietnam vet of that era,
[01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:08.440]  great patriot, head of the police and military against the New World Order for 25 years.
[01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:13.080]  He put out the Vampire Killer 2000 document that's woken up millions of police over the
[01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:14.080]  years.
[01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:15.720]  Let's go to Jack McClam.
[01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:21.920]  Jack, you wanted to comment on my discussion last hour of the New Orleans police that shot
[01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:27.080]  two innocent people, killed them, and then tried to frame some of the other innocent
[01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:30.920]  people they'd been shooting at, and I have no idea what your take is on it, but I'd like
[01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:31.920]  to get it.
[01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:32.920]  Welcome, Jack.
[01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:33.920]  Yes, thank you, brother.
[01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:34.920]  Good to talk to you, Alex.
[01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:36.920]  Happy New Year to you.
[01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:37.920]  You bet.
[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:47.560]  Yes, here, about six months ago, our police and military association put out a publication
[01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:56.040]  that showed 12 ways in which judges and prosecutors, both government agents today, manipulate the
[01:10:56.040 --> 01:11:03.120]  jury's minds to come out with a jury decision that they wish to come out with, and what
[01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:08.960]  we found over the years as we've attended literally hundreds of thousands of trials is
[01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:20.480]  that when the government has a friend or an associate on trial, many times, the judge
[01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:28.280]  will allow the prosecution to come in with a charge that is totally unsubstantiated.
[01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:36.720]  In other words, they can't prove it like first-degree murder in this case, and then
[01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:43.040]  the judge will not allow the jury to accept a lower charge if the jury finds out these
[01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:51.400]  people can't be convicted of first-degree murder, then the judge just lets them off.
[01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:55.600]  The judge will not allow the jury to come in with second-degree murder or manslaughter
[01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:56.600]  or something like that.
[01:11:56.600 --> 01:12:00.440]  It's a way to, with massive attention, to make it look like the state was trying to
[01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:04.280]  hit them hard, but in truth, clearly it's not premeditated murder.
[01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:09.920]  It's a crime of passion, manslaughter, negligent homicide, one of those two, you can give me
[01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:14.320]  your take on which one you think it is, and that's a really good point, Jack.
[01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:20.960]  Yes, and we've seen this happen over and over again, but in most cases where it be a citizen
[01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:27.240]  on trial, the judge will allow the jury to come back with a lesser charge, a finding
[01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:31.320]  of a lesser guilty verdict on somebody.
[01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:34.680]  What do you think of the case itself and then how they tried to frame people they'd been
[01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:38.040]  shooting at for no reason?
[01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:44.560]  Well, it just sounds like it's the classic case where they're going to let these officers
[01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:50.440]  off is what it sounds like, and so they're muddying the water with all of these other
[01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:57.480]  charges and trying to manipulate the jury before the jury's even in the jury pool.
[01:12:57.480 --> 01:12:59.080]  You know what I mean?
[01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:03.360]  The jury reads the newspaper or the people that are going to be on the jury that don't
[01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:07.520]  even know they're going to be on the jury, and they start reading all these things, and
[01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:14.640]  then they pick the jury, and the jury is confused and misdirected many times, and it sounds like
[01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:21.200]  this is a classic case of misdirection for the jury members and for the public.
[01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:26.640]  Well, from the evidence of the case, they don't contest, they just open fire on a crowd
[01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:27.640]  of people.
[01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:28.640]  Right.
[01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:30.840]  What charge do you think there should be?
[01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:36.720]  Well, I don't know all the evidence going to be presented, but it sounds like a good
[01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:40.280]  case for second degree murder is what it sounds like.
[01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:47.800]  You know, if they just open fire on a group of people out there, unless we find in the
[01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:53.320]  evidence, true evidence that is, because a lot of times they manufacture evidence the
[01:13:53.320 --> 01:14:00.480]  government does and manufacture witnesses, destroy evidence and destroy witnesses, you
[01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:03.560]  know, don't let witnesses on to testify.
[01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:10.240]  We find this in many of these government cases, but if it is true that they just open fire
[01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:16.640]  on a group of citizens out there, the second degree murder would be a good charge to go
[01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:19.160]  with on this case.
[01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:25.680]  Jack McClam, they admit that they tried to basically charge some of the people that had
[01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:30.680]  done nothing, I guess, as a way to suppress them and keep them from suing or speaking
[01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:31.680]  out.
[01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:35.680]  To me, that is the big premeditated crime right there.
[01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:43.320]  Yeah, many times, as you know, Alex, whenever you have this happen in the city of Phoenix,
[01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:50.280]  when I was a police investigator there, whenever somebody has a good case to sue the city,
[01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:54.960]  the city will charge them with something, and then they'll do a King's Act, you know,
[01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:59.120]  you drop your charges, we'll drop your, you know, if you're not going to sue the city,
[01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:02.120]  then we'll drop our charges against you.
[01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:07.920]  And so, you never know, Alex, the games are playing, but we would ask the public, before
[01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:14.200]  they stand and go in for jury duty, to get a copy of our ain't a bet police military
[01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:21.120]  newsletter we put out specifically for prospective jurors to read these 12 ways in which the
[01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:27.000]  judge and the prosecutor will secretly manipulate their minds without them knowing about it
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:32.040]  to come out with a jury decision the government wants in these cases.
[01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:37.240]  They ought to read that so that they, and then before they go for jury duty, pull it
[01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:38.240]  down and read it again.
[01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:41.880]  Well, many Americans think that we've had our right to vote taken away because of these
[01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:46.400]  fraudulent machines, but we still have the grand jury box and the jury box, which are
[01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:52.120]  also forms of a pure vote, and all the jurisprudence, all the precedents, the founding fathers
[01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:59.480]  stated, it is a veto, the people's veto against bad law and bad corrupt systems, and so even
[01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:06.840]  if it's quote the law, let's say that a black man wasn't allowed to say when he was a slave,
[01:16:06.840 --> 01:16:11.080]  take a hickory stick away from somebody beating him and beat his master to death, and you
[01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:14.600]  know, the jury thinks that this person really should be allowed to go free.
[01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:18.240]  The jury can say, well, according to the law may say he's a slave, but we say he's going
[01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:19.240]  free.
[01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:22.440]  That happened during the first years of abolition, and then of course there's, you know, the
[01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:28.080]  famous cases that people then put into fiction books like a time to kill, like somebody rapes
[01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:32.120]  and kills somebody's little daughter, or beats them, and then the father goes and blows
[01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:35.400]  them away, and the jury says, we don't care, he walks.
[01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:39.440]  That's what the jury's supposed to do.
[01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:45.960]  It is, but I'll say if the people knew of these 12 ways, and there's other ways too
[01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:52.200]  in which the government agent judge and the government agent prosecutor conspired together
[01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:56.680]  without the knowledge covertly, without the knowledge of the jurors to manipulate their
[01:16:56.680 --> 01:17:05.120]  minds, they would be a much better juror going into these cases, and so we request all Americans
[01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:12.560]  to read this ainabette police military newsletter on empowering the jury to know when the judge
[01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:15.160]  and the prosecutor have formed a conspiracy against the jury.
[01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:18.880]  Now can folks go to JackMcLam.com, or do they need to write to you to get that?
[01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:24.080]  Yeah, that would be fine, just www.JackMcLam.com.
[01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:26.080]  Does that have your jury paper on it?
[01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:27.080]  It does, yes.
[01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:33.640]  Well, they could just call that number, and there, or write to the address, and we request
[01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:37.520]  because we're an all-volunteer police and military association that they put three
[01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:43.160]  bucks in an envelope to help us pay for the postage and pay for the printing cost.
[01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:49.040]  Well, that's important, Jack, that people get a copy of it, but I would also just throw
[01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:50.560]  it up on the web.
[01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:53.960]  I think something that important, because I've heard you do shows on it, and I've read
[01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:56.400]  some of your past material that I agree with.
[01:17:56.400 --> 01:17:57.680]  Let us do this, Alex.
[01:17:57.680 --> 01:18:04.120]  Let us send you out a copy of it, and you'll see how powerful it is if every jury, or prospective
[01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:10.720]  jury before they went into Bourdire would read that newsletter, they would be ready
[01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:15.440]  for anything the prosecutor and judge are going to concoct to try to get their friends
[01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:21.960]  off in a case, or to convict somebody that is a political prisoner, as we have so many
[01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:29.720]  today political prisoners, they won't be likely to go along with the manipulation, psychological
[01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:32.080]  manipulation of the judge and the prosecutor.
[01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:37.360]  Let us send you a copy of that, Alex, and you look at it, and you'll see what we mean
[01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:39.360]  that every hour you read it.
[01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:43.600]  I've interviewed Red Beckman and many others, and Father of the Fully Formed Jury Association
[01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:47.920]  Movement, but no, I've heard your analysis of it, and all the tricks that you've learned
[01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:48.920]  through using.
[01:18:48.920 --> 01:18:49.920]  So that's great, Jack.
[01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:50.920]  Thank you for coming on.
[01:18:50.920 --> 01:18:52.480]  I need to get you on as a guest soon.
[01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:55.000]  Okay, brother, sounds good.
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.480]  How are things going up there in the great Rocky Mountains?
[01:18:57.480 --> 01:18:59.960]  Hey, things are going very well.
[01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:04.520]  We're having meetings again here for the citizens in the county, and they're going very, very
[01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:12.600]  well as we're trying to stave off the national ID and all these things that the county can
[01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:14.480]  actually stop.
[01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:19.440]  Our county leadership can actually stop these things, even if the state goes along with
[01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:22.560]  it, and so we're happy to have our meetings started up again.
[01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:28.680]  In the last minute we've got left, I think it's important that we stay in different groups
[01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:32.920]  and different organizations and different tactics, but read from the same sheet of music,
[01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:36.400]  the Constitution, because that makes us harder to penetrate or control.
[01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:40.800]  Do you agree with my analysis on the lone wolf mode?
[01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:41.800]  I do, brother.
[01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:47.840]  It's so important that we stay in our small groups because for years and years, government
[01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:52.120]  snitches and agents have been trying to convince us to all come together in one big group in
[01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:57.960]  America, and that's the worst thing you could do because it's so easy to penetrate, so many
[01:19:57.960 --> 01:20:04.560]  groups that this has been done to over the years that we know of, and so no, don't come
[01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:07.560]  together in one group, stay independent.
[01:20:07.560 --> 01:20:11.360]  And by that, you still go to big meetings, you're still part of bigger grids, but it's
[01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:14.400]  just when you've only got a few big groups, it's easy for them to take control of them
[01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:19.040]  and manipulate them, demonize them, but they can't stop just a general movement of liberty
[01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:20.040]  and freedom.
[01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:23.480]  All right, Jack McClain, I appreciate you calling in.
[01:20:23.480 --> 01:20:24.480]  Thank you, brother.
[01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:25.480]  Good to hear from you.
[01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:30.040]  Yeah, I watch these people, and I know it's instinctive to want a leader, but watch these
[01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:33.360]  people that, you know, say, we need to be the leader.
[01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:37.880]  Now you can bring Berkey purification power anywhere with the Sport Berkey filtration
[01:20:37.880 --> 01:20:42.400]  bottle, ideal for sporting games, camping or boating, or Sport Berkey is small enough

[01:21:00.200 --> 01:21:05.440]  it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.

[01:21:37.400 --> 01:21:43.960]  Did you know that the United Nations' basic philosophy is both anti-American and pro-dictatorship?
[01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:48.240]  Did you know that the United Nations was founded by communists and marchists members of the
[01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:53.480]  Council on Foreign Relations whose goal is a socialistic one-world government?
[01:21:53.480 --> 01:21:58.920]  We would like to help you understand why these things are happening and how they fulfill

[01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:39.000]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson here for the 2007 Red Book.
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:43.520]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last
[01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:44.520]  year.
[01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:49.360]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S. dollar can be devalued.
[01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:53.240]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential
[01:22:53.240 --> 01:22:54.240]  profits.
[01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:59.320]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth,
[01:22:59.320 --> 01:23:03.160]  it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:08.240]  Midas Resources is offering the Red Book and Silver Dollar for only $27.95.
[01:23:08.240 --> 01:23:12.800]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:14.040]  Call for your copy today.

[01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:21.320]  If you have already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply
[01:23:21.320 --> 01:23:24.160]  must have the Red Book in your library.
[01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:32.480]  Call 800-686-2237 at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:23:32.480 --> 01:23:33.480]  Hello friends.
[01:23:33.480 --> 01:23:35.120]  Alex Jones here with an important question.
[01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:37.120]  What was the last time you used pure soap?
[01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:42.440]  I mean real hard to find all-natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants,
[01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:44.520]  detergents or other dangerous toxins.
[01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:49.480]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated
[01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:53.480]  pure soaps exclusively for health care professionals and hospitals.

[01:24:57.240 --> 01:25:03.880]  All right, let's try to hurry through your calls because I got Kevin and Aaron who were
[01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:06.880]  up there at the FEMA camp yesterday to be in studio to tell you some of the other things
[01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:09.960]  they witnessed after the show ended.
[01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:11.360]  They're in Taylor, Texas, north of Austin.
[01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:14.960]  I've got a bunch of global news to cover, several other big audio clips I want to play
[01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:17.400]  and two guests in the next hour.
[01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:23.440]  Joe in Pittsburgh, you were asking about everybody coming together and it seems like at a primitive
[01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:27.200]  level let's all get together, let's go wage war on the enemy, let's have one group
[01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:28.800]  and one organization.
[01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:33.240]  Then they can infiltrate, they can have people infiltrate the group, get caught with drugs
[01:25:33.240 --> 01:25:38.200]  or get caught with other bad things or they can just demonize the name of the group.
[01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:42.800]  But if you're just a movement of freedom and by that people coming together but starting
[01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:49.320]  lots of second amendment groups or border control groups or land rights organizations
[01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:54.760]  or anti-globalist organizations, getting elected at city council, getting elected on the school
[01:25:54.760 --> 01:26:02.640]  board, just holding back big government, it's basically a constitutionalist philosophy.
[01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:08.600]  That's really the key here and I'm not saying your question was motivated by ill or bad
[01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:13.520]  but so many others have come up through the ranks and demanded that, Jones you must merge
[01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:18.880]  with us and fight the new world order and really so many times that's just an attempt
[01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:25.720]  for egomaniacs to gain control of a movement or they're just misguided or they're fetched
[01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:30.480]  but you wanted to say something about music and then I got to let you go.
[01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:36.720]  Well first of all I do agree with you that I avoid you just saying there, I meant disorganize
[01:26:36.720 --> 01:26:43.640]  in that not all of the groups that say there for the truth movement are going by the sheet
[01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:45.400]  music of the constitution so to speak.
[01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:49.360]  Well that's what I've tried to do, I've tried to make this broadcast not about infighting
[01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:53.920]  and egomaniac like most other patron networks and talk show hosts, I've tried to make it
[01:26:53.920 --> 01:26:57.840]  about moving forward and having an effect and we've done that to a great extent and
[01:26:57.840 --> 01:27:03.400]  so have other organizations that are doing a good job and so that's what's happening.
[01:27:03.400 --> 01:27:08.520]  And the thing about music is I think music is one of the most beautiful and inspiring
[01:27:08.520 --> 01:27:14.600]  things that a human being can be part of and create and I think that is a good way for
[01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:19.480]  people to come together and that's why a lot of people are creating anti-new world
[01:27:19.480 --> 01:27:25.280]  order music from hip hop to classical to you name it and I appreciate your call, send me
[01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:28.160]  the music you put together with your wife, I'd like to hear it.
[01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:34.360]  Let's talk to Chris in Florida, Chris you're on the air, thanks for holding, yes sir.
[01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:40.840]  Last week on Tuesday or Wednesday I heard on my local Rush Limbaugh radio station just
[01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:45.280]  a question I don't normally tend to in Rush Limbaugh, I heard in the morning where they
[01:27:45.280 --> 01:27:53.080]  give about two to three minutes of Rush's commentary and they had Rush commentating
[01:27:53.080 --> 01:27:59.000]  giving an explanation of what Kevin Barrett was doing, Professor Barrett, he claimed that
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:05.360]  just as O'Reilly has claimed that Kevin Barrett is forcing his students to buy his book on
[01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:06.360]  9-11.
[01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:08.000]  Have you heard about that?
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:15.120]  It's not true and I've had Limbaugh attack me as the evil leader of 9-11 Truth who's
[01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:21.400]  you know I'm just out to destroy America and I'm so evil and I mean these guys are dinosaurs,
[01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:25.200]  they're losing their audiences, they're losing their credibility, real conservatives are
[01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:27.080]  seeing right through them.
[01:28:27.080 --> 01:28:34.680]  I agree, I just wanted to encourage people to expose Limbaugh and discredit him whenever
[01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:40.760]  they get the chance and a tip I wanted to ask your advice on calling into talk shows
[01:28:40.760 --> 01:28:47.640]  and to discredit them, but what do you think about the idea of when a caller calls into
[01:28:47.640 --> 01:28:54.040]  a host who's basically promoting war, trying to trick us into war through lies and half
[01:28:54.040 --> 01:29:01.800]  truths or trying to trick us into doing something unhealthy for example, say they're against
[01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:05.680]  vitamin C, they say you don't need it when it's an essential nutrient.
[01:29:05.680 --> 01:29:07.680]  People like Dr. David Elliott.
[01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:13.760]  Yeah, things like being a foot doctor, but what do you think about letting the talk show
[01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:20.840]  host know exactly or let the sponsors of the talk show host know why you won't patronize
[01:29:20.840 --> 01:29:25.960]  them, exactly what lies that these talk show hosts are telling, write them down, call the
[01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:30.480]  sponsors or write them and let them know that you will not patronize them because of
[01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:31.960]  the host that they're...
[01:29:31.960 --> 01:29:36.520]  Well it's a free country, you can do that if you want to, you know I think it's, the
[01:29:36.520 --> 01:29:41.440]  key is not so much even paying attention to those people, but just promoting alternative
[01:29:41.440 --> 01:29:46.520]  media that you found to be accurate, that you respect, that you think is valuable and
[01:29:46.520 --> 01:29:53.800]  valid, I think that's really more important than attacking them because in the final equation
[01:29:53.800 --> 01:30:00.760]  just attacking them isn't as effective as promoting the truth.
[01:30:00.760 --> 01:30:06.280]  Well it can be effective sometimes but I've had callers after me who seem to have agreed
[01:30:06.280 --> 01:30:11.240]  with the host but right after the host is forced to dump me then you know I plan that
[01:30:11.240 --> 01:30:15.360]  the next caller is a little bit shaky in his support for the host.
[01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:17.680]  Yes, we'll be right back, thanks for the call.
[01:30:17.680 --> 01:30:23.560]  I'll comment on tactics to use on these people when we get back.
[01:30:23.560 --> 01:30:33.440]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:33.440 --> 01:30:37.680]  I found this company online and they had this really unique variety of salt wellness products,
[01:30:37.680 --> 01:30:41.840]  I read some of the articles and ended up ordering this beautiful salt lamp.
[01:30:41.840 --> 01:30:45.840]  According to the company, they said that the salt crystal lamps gently purify indoor air.
[01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:50.440]  I was so amazed, I put it in the baby's room and it made a perfect night light, both my
[01:30:50.440 --> 01:30:52.480]  husband and I could tell the difference.
[01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:57.120]  Solay Wellness dot com is a unique company that offers salt wellness products from around
[01:30:57.120 --> 01:30:58.120]  the world.
[01:30:58.120 --> 01:31:02.800]  So, I went back to the site and ordered their Soleil Simple Natural Cleaning products,
[01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:06.240]  also made with Himalayan salt, I figured it would clean really well.
[01:31:06.240 --> 01:31:10.560]  The natural cleaning products worked wonderfully and there was no scent, this company has so
[01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:15.600]  many products my whole family can enjoy and feel better with, plus the service was great.

[01:31:34.720 --> 01:31:41.760]  Hi folks, Jack Browner from Midas Resources, real money folks.
[01:31:41.760 --> 01:31:44.120]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[01:31:44.120 --> 01:31:52.920]  From November 2003 to November 2004, the dollars ranged from 9,800 to 10,300, a 5% increase.
[01:31:52.920 --> 01:31:59.520]  The dollar's value has dropped from 96 cents to 70 cents against the euro, a 24% decrease
[01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:03.080]  in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[01:32:03.080 --> 01:32:09.400]  Gold has gone from the 390s to the 440s, a 16% increase in real money.
[01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:12.760]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.
[01:32:12.760 --> 01:32:20.680]  To learn how to protect your shrinking dollar, call Midas Resources today at 1-800-686-223-7.
[01:32:20.680 --> 01:32:23.920]  Remember gold is liquid, private, and portable.

[01:32:33.600 --> 01:32:38.640]  It's no secret, aluminum itself adversely affects the blood-brain barrier and is capable
[01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:40.600]  of causing DNA damage.
[01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:45.480]  Research has even shown that aluminum salts used in antiperspirants have detrimental effects.
[01:32:45.480 --> 01:32:47.520]  So why are you still using traditional deodorant?
[01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:51.080]  Well, there is an alternative and it's called nobio.
[01:32:51.080 --> 01:32:56.000]  Nobio eliminates the bacterial growth which causes odor and does not interfere with perspiration,
[01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:59.200]  which is important for allowing your body to expel toxins.
[01:32:59.200 --> 01:33:03.800]  There are no chemicals, aluminum, preservatives, or petroleum-based ingredients in nobio.
[01:33:03.800 --> 01:33:08.840]  Just natural ingredients like grapeseed oil, arrowroot powder, silica, vitamin E, tea tree
[01:33:08.840 --> 01:33:10.360]  oil, and geranium.
[01:33:10.360 --> 01:33:14.400]  Nobio's job is to destroy the bacteria that causes odor while soothing your skin.
[01:33:14.400 --> 01:33:19.200]  You can use nobio under your arms, on tough foot odors, or for athlete's foot.
[01:33:19.200 --> 01:33:23.240]  Nobio is guaranteed 100% or receive a full refund.

[01:34:31.480 --> 01:34:35.120]  the hell, Turn right
[01:34:35.120 --> 01:34:44.880]  Without the running game, Lord knows well where we'd stay
[01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:47.680]  When your Polish, the heroes renegade your mind
[01:34:47.680 --> 01:35:08.680]  They railed against the crowd, with another red tag band Declaring independence
[01:35:08.680 --> 01:35:18.680]  They divide us down, on a bloody war, on liberty for dear descendants
