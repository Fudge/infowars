[08:11.000 --> 08:13.800]  radio network
[08:13.800 --> 08:21.080]  everything is accelerating
[08:22.600 --> 08:28.400]  to say that criminal government is rampaging looting every sector of the
[08:28.400 --> 08:33.920]  world economy erecting police state measures never before seen by any other
[08:33.920 --> 08:41.480]  nation the united states and england and europe are now making communist china
[08:41.480 --> 08:45.400]  and its surveillance look tame
[08:47.920 --> 08:53.120]  I mean I'm speechless that it's all materializing worse than we had
[08:53.120 --> 08:58.200]  predicted it would we're gonna go over a growing list of officials and experts
[08:58.200 --> 09:03.800]  warn of depression including violence that's exactly what they want u.s. claims

[09:10.120 --> 09:16.440]  they're looting the new voriche ap interview transportation secretary says
[09:16.440 --> 09:22.280]  taxing how much we drive may replace gas tax now
[09:25.320 --> 09:30.440]  I would read this 12 years ago in transportation publications
[09:30.440 --> 09:34.600]  for people in that industry that's where we get a lot of our news and
[09:34.600 --> 09:38.280]  information you know a decade before its mainstream news
[09:38.280 --> 09:41.720]  it's in the trade publications and listeners mail me trade publications
[09:41.720 --> 09:44.680]  and highlight and put notes in it it's very helpful
[09:44.680 --> 09:47.800]  and I'd go on air and talk about it and I've been
[09:47.800 --> 09:53.480]  laughed at on this subject specifically on national radio repeatedly
[09:53.480 --> 09:57.160]  I've had host laugh at me while I'm on air with them oh the government's going
[09:57.160 --> 10:02.120]  to tax you by the mile and track me ha ha you're a conspiracy theorist and I
[10:02.120 --> 10:06.680]  said look it's in this trade publication the federal government is having major
[10:06.680 --> 10:12.920]  studies and says that they plan by 2010 this was a decade ago
[10:13.640 --> 10:19.320]  that by 2010 all americans will have a satellite tracker box in their car by
[10:19.320 --> 10:24.200]  law and will be taxed and they just laugh at me like every other
[10:24.200 --> 10:28.840]  subject I remember 12 13 years ago going the army plans
[10:28.840 --> 10:33.720]  to forcibly implant the american people with chips
[10:33.720 --> 10:36.760]  and people would laugh at me I mean it's official
[10:36.760 --> 10:40.600]  army war college doctor and they put it back out
[10:40.600 --> 10:46.840]  uh in 2000 it's in my book to send to tyranny
[10:47.800 --> 10:55.400]  it's all public this is sick you know where they got the idea for the matrix
[10:55.400 --> 11:00.840]  they got that from pentagon plans look I know it sounds insane I know putting
[11:00.840 --> 11:04.600]  satellite tracker boxes in your car and taxing you sounds insane
[11:04.600 --> 11:11.080]  but that they say that humans will be put into tanks in hive mind and that for
[11:11.080 --> 11:14.600]  our safety there'll be no more murder or crime we will live in tanks
[11:14.600 --> 11:20.360]  from birth this is this is it and I'm not a conspiracy theorist this is what
[11:20.360 --> 11:25.880]  they are saying this whole social welfare net this whole grid
[11:25.880 --> 11:29.160]  everything they're putting into place is about domesticating us now I don't know
[11:29.160 --> 11:31.880]  if these lunatics will ever get to that point
[11:31.880 --> 11:35.800]  but if you look at pure military domination how do you dominate a
[11:35.800 --> 11:39.960]  population either wipe them all out or you imprison them
[11:39.960 --> 11:44.040]  and they say that we are going to merge and they set up these federal
[11:44.040 --> 11:46.600]  futurist centers with nasa and the rest of them
[11:46.600 --> 11:53.160]  that humans are going to merge with computers and that if we don't accept
[11:53.160 --> 11:55.320]  it that they're not going to allow people to be like
[11:55.320 --> 11:59.880]  Amish and say no that you're just going to be killed
[11:59.880 --> 12:04.520]  but I'm already digressing you know if the cowards out there can't deal with
[12:04.520 --> 12:07.640]  that information that's fine
[12:07.640 --> 12:10.680]  you know if cowards can't deal with the fact that for more than a decade they've
[12:10.680 --> 12:14.520]  had spider goats that produce body armor and you know the
[12:14.520 --> 12:17.640]  news wants to make fun of me and laugh at me about that fine it's true
[12:17.640 --> 12:23.240]  it's public I've interviewed the CEO of the company it's even been in the news
[12:23.240 --> 12:27.240]  but look at this ap interview transportation secretary says taxing
[12:27.240 --> 12:29.560]  how much we drive may replace gasoline tax
[12:29.560 --> 12:34.360]  curtain mo wrote a story on monday linking to the federal government
[12:34.360 --> 12:38.120]  at the very symposium where they gave the speech
[12:38.120 --> 12:42.280]  and he reported on it and here it is in the ap five days later
[12:42.280 --> 12:46.040]  why are they now announcing it after secretly developing it and denying it
[12:46.040 --> 12:49.080]  for years you know that's another reason we get
[12:49.080 --> 12:52.440]  called conspiracy theorist in government documents they'll announce
[12:52.440 --> 12:55.960]  they're setting up a world government and that a huge bank of the world will
[12:55.960 --> 12:58.760]  regulate us and we'll pay our carbon taxes to it
[12:58.760 --> 13:02.840]  but then when we talk about it they'll write a new york times article saying
[13:02.840 --> 13:07.560]  alex jones is insane and believes in an imaginary group called the bohemian
[13:07.560 --> 13:10.760]  grove and the builder bird group
[13:14.360 --> 13:18.760]  that's because they think you're so stupid that you won't find out about
[13:18.760 --> 13:22.600]  this i mean i still have talk show host locally making fun of me saying i
[13:22.600 --> 13:27.880]  believe in imaginary skull and bones it doesn't matter if skull and bones is
[13:27.880 --> 13:30.600]  public it doesn't matter of geronimo's great
[13:30.600 --> 13:35.560]  great-grandson is suing them to return his skull that press got bush went in
[13:35.560 --> 13:39.400]  grave robbed again because that does sound crazy the president's grandfather
[13:39.400 --> 13:45.080]  of the senator grave robbing but it's true that's what they do
[13:45.080 --> 13:51.880]  it's a ghoulish society a a a a vampire society are they really vampires no
[13:51.880 --> 13:55.000]  they're lunatics
[13:55.080 --> 14:01.320]  they're lunatics i'm not the lunatic i'm not the one writing army army
[14:01.320 --> 14:03.960]  documents saying they're going to stick us in tanks
[14:03.960 --> 14:08.040]  i'm not the one grave robbing i'm just reporting on it
[14:08.040 --> 14:12.440]  i'm not the one splicing spiders and goats and monkeys with jellyfish
[14:12.440 --> 14:17.080]  they are i'm the same person
[14:17.080 --> 14:22.280]  you are the same people who don't like this
[14:22.280 --> 14:27.160]  now i see one of these reports about every three weeks
[14:27.160 --> 14:33.800]  and they'll say tulsa airport or boston airport
[14:36.760 --> 14:40.520]  i see these reports every three weeks or so
[14:40.520 --> 14:43.400]  announcing and this is done through psychological warfare i've read the
[14:43.400 --> 14:48.760]  british manuals on psych warfare with their colonies
[14:48.760 --> 14:52.120]  post-world war two and they said what we do is we take down our flag we put
[14:52.120 --> 14:55.960]  puppets in you know just basic handbooks for their foreign service people
[14:55.960 --> 14:59.080]  this is you know declassified very important stuff is all still the same
[14:59.080 --> 15:02.680]  tricks and what we'll do is when we're putting in a program that's unpopular
[15:02.680 --> 15:06.520]  we'll only announce it at one location even though it's going in everywhere
[15:06.520 --> 15:11.560]  or at most locations and then psychologically uh through their studies
[15:11.560 --> 15:15.160]  they say it shows that people minimize the effect even when they see it
[15:15.160 --> 15:19.080]  unfold everywhere and that's what this article is
[15:19.080 --> 15:22.600]  you know separate from how horrible it is just recognizing
[15:22.600 --> 15:26.120]  the propaganda is important tulsa passengers
[15:26.120 --> 15:31.720]  try out tsa's full body scanners this is usa today the main propaganda i mean the
[15:31.720 --> 15:34.920]  worst propaganda paper out that they announced things in this

[15:59.560 --> 16:03.800]  is oh you try it out like you take a car for a test driver you
[16:03.800 --> 16:07.000]  try out the new mocha latte at starbucks you know
[16:07.000 --> 16:11.480]  oh they try it out implying that they're not being forced to
[16:11.480 --> 16:15.000]  and let me just tell you something these are already in over 100 airports i know
[16:15.000 --> 16:18.840]  of they announced last year they're going to put them in 214 airports
[16:18.840 --> 16:23.080]  it was in four airports a month after 9 11
[16:23.080 --> 16:27.880]  it was in more than 40 or 50 a few years ago you know i see these numbers and
[16:27.880 --> 16:31.160]  now it's over a hundred and they're going to put them in all 200
[16:31.160 --> 16:34.040]  and 11 major airports but every time they announce it it's
[16:34.040 --> 16:41.560]  oh tulsa got one or denver got one or lax has got some that was a month ago
[16:41.560 --> 16:45.560]  they announced lax here's a glimpse at the future of aviation
[16:45.560 --> 16:48.600]  security airline passenger natalie miller steps into a
[16:48.600 --> 16:52.200]  glass booth at a checkpoint she raises her arms within moments of screener
[16:52.200 --> 16:57.640]  ask her what is in her bag pocket and see the article
[16:57.640 --> 17:03.240]  you know shows that they were bad they had something to

[24:34.760 --> 24:38.120]  i mean i almost just can't even come on air and talk about this that almost
[24:38.120 --> 24:42.600]  lessens how serious it is this is full war against the republic
[24:42.600 --> 24:46.440]  north com openly to use 20 000 troops for gun confiscation
[24:46.440 --> 24:52.920]  in the united states in the army times i mean it is it is just off the charts
[24:52.920 --> 24:56.200]  what is happening representative joel bonick montana
[24:56.200 --> 24:58.760]  was going to be on about five minutes he called him a little bit early so we're
[24:58.760 --> 25:02.360]  going to go ahead and go to him now montana
[25:02.360 --> 25:06.360]  oiziana mississippi Wyoming a bunch of other states
[25:06.360 --> 25:12.280]  are moving out of past laws uh that are defending the second amendment declaring
[25:12.280 --> 25:16.280]  state sovereignty representative thank you for calling in thank you it's good
[25:16.280 --> 25:19.720]  to be with you did you just hear the latest news it's out of the daily times
[25:19.720 --> 25:24.120]  herald about the army training to confiscate guns in the u.s.
[25:24.120 --> 25:27.800]  i have not but uh we're alarmed about the kind of thing in montana we would
[25:27.800 --> 25:31.560]  like to do something about that okay tell us about the particular bills you've
[25:31.560 --> 25:36.360]  introduced dealing with sovereignty well this is house bill 246 in montana
[25:36.360 --> 25:40.360]  and it has passed second reading which means that it has one more hurdle to go
[25:40.360 --> 25:43.640]  through before it goes to the senate for its concurrence and essentially what it
[25:43.640 --> 25:47.800]  would do is to exempt firearms manufacturer in montana from
[25:47.800 --> 25:50.680]  federal regulations because what we're doing is asserting
[25:50.680 --> 25:53.560]  horror rights under the tenth amendment the ninth amendment and the second
[25:53.560 --> 25:58.680]  amendment of the u.s constitution to not be regulated by the federal government
[25:58.680 --> 26:03.640]  when it does not involve interstate commerce
[26:03.640 --> 26:08.040]  absolutely fabulous sir we've seen other states pass laws saying gun
[26:08.040 --> 26:10.920]  confiscation will be resisted by the state
[26:10.920 --> 26:14.280]  because the new attorney general has said in federal court he
[26:14.280 --> 26:17.400]  believes that citizens have no right to own any firearms
[26:17.400 --> 26:22.200]  even in their home he argued in the dc case last year but failed
[26:22.200 --> 26:28.360]  um let me put this in perspective here what the congress has done under what
[26:28.360 --> 26:32.040]  they call the interstate commerce clause which is in the u.s constitution
[26:32.040 --> 26:36.040]  uh congress has the power to regulate commerce in between states so that one
[26:36.040 --> 26:39.880]  state can't put such high taxes on the goods coming into their state from
[26:39.880 --> 26:42.600]  another state and going to a third state that it
[26:42.600 --> 26:47.160]  makes commerce not workable but they have used that clause
[26:47.160 --> 26:50.920]  so that anything that even is even remotely
[26:50.920 --> 26:55.640]  connected with interstate commerce is is uh regulated by congress and so what
[26:55.640 --> 26:58.600]  we're saying is that we're going to make guns in montana
[26:58.600 --> 27:02.440]  that do not travel in interstate commerce and so therefore you have no
[27:02.440 --> 27:07.800]  right to regulate them absolutely um a lot of other
[27:07.800 --> 27:11.320]  states including texas and minnesota in the last 24 hours have
[27:11.320 --> 27:14.600]  introduced resolutions declaring just overall state sovereignty
[27:14.600 --> 27:18.360]  through the federal tenth amendment uh new hampshire has one saying no to gun
[27:18.360 --> 27:23.240]  confiscation no to marshal law uh is there any similar legislation slated
[27:23.240 --> 27:25.800]  i mean oh this is a tenth amendment declaration as well
[27:25.800 --> 27:31.560]  uh bill um house bill 246 uh is there any broader bills being introduced
[27:31.560 --> 27:35.960]  yes there are representative michael moore m or e is introducing
[27:35.960 --> 27:39.640]  a bill and um also senator or a representative
[27:39.640 --> 27:43.400]  wagner is introducing a bill for hard money and these are all
[27:43.400 --> 27:47.960]  declarations of uh montana sovereignty and calling the federal government to
[27:47.960 --> 27:52.680]  back to its proper sphere of influence well the federal government sir has
[27:52.680 --> 27:56.200]  i'm you're probably aware been hijacked by falling offshore banks publicly
[27:56.200 --> 27:59.640]  newsweek time magazine wall street urinal announcing a new bank of the world
[27:59.640 --> 28:03.880]  that will quote rule the united states and quote knock our heads these are
[28:03.880 --> 28:07.480]  quotes uh and that we will pay carbon taxes to them so
[28:07.480 --> 28:10.440]  we don't even have a federal government anymore it's it's i mean the congress
[28:10.440 --> 28:13.880]  was threatened with marshal law according to senator inhofe and other
[28:13.880 --> 28:17.160]  congressman we interviewed uh when they wouldn't pass the banker takeover
[28:17.160 --> 28:20.920]  bill are you aware of that i didn't know that particular piece
[28:20.920 --> 28:23.880]  well the reason i'm pointing this out is your influential and you sound like a
[28:23.880 --> 28:27.640]  patriot we're trying to let you know what we're aware of i mean it is
[28:27.640 --> 28:31.240]  past midnight here when it comes to tyranny
[28:31.240 --> 28:35.160]  yes i understand the bigger picture and the the procedure here is
[28:35.160 --> 28:39.160]  uh to make intimate incremental progress one step at a time
[28:39.160 --> 28:42.840]  towards a state sovereignty and a restoration of the constitution
[28:42.840 --> 28:46.280]  i'd like to point out to you that i'm getting phone calls and emails from all
[28:46.280 --> 28:49.640]  of the united states of people organizing and saying how can we support
[28:49.640 --> 28:51.960]  this effort and how can we duplicate it in our
[28:51.960 --> 28:56.200]  state so one man called me from a fairbanks alaska and he says that
[28:56.200 --> 29:00.280]  he called a meeting and um 150 people showed up when he thought there'd be
[29:00.280 --> 29:02.600]  five or six and so they moved it to another venue had
[29:02.600 --> 29:06.520]  700 and now there are 1000 people in his group and they're going to introduce
[29:06.520 --> 29:09.400]  this kind of stuff into the alaska legislature
[29:09.400 --> 29:13.400]  yes this is exponential i hope the establishment understands
[29:13.400 --> 29:17.080]  they've miscalculated with this power grab and are fomenting
[29:17.080 --> 29:21.960]  um a massive rebellion but i wouldn't even call it a rebellion it's a move to
[29:21.960 --> 29:26.120]  restore the republic yes i tried to make a point on the floor with my
[29:26.120 --> 29:29.960]  colleagues that this is not some radical legislation all this is doing is
[29:29.960 --> 29:34.040]  redrawing the lines clearly in the separation of powers and this is what
[29:34.040 --> 29:37.800]  our country was founded on and we stand squarely
[29:37.800 --> 29:40.680]  on the shoulders of our founders of both the united states and montana in

[34:55.720 --> 35:00.600]  uh they are letting foreign banks take over i mean this is getting insane
[35:00.600 --> 35:04.360]  it is getting insane and there's people contacting me continuously every day
[35:04.360 --> 35:07.720]  saying that we're tired of it and we want to do something about it
[35:07.720 --> 35:10.280]  and we're not going to sit by idle anymore there are people getting
[35:10.280 --> 35:13.880]  involved who never were involved before even military veterans because they're
[35:13.880 --> 35:17.720]  saying it's just gone too far and it's all over the edge
[35:17.720 --> 35:21.400]  what do you what is fema doing what what is the presidency doing well
[35:21.400 --> 35:25.800]  i mean i mean we know power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely but
[35:25.800 --> 35:30.760]  i mean this is just amazing too long that people have been asleep and we've
[35:30.760 --> 35:34.040]  been thinking that the government should be doing what's right but we need to
[35:34.040 --> 35:37.160]  start taking it for granted that it's applied against us and they're always
[35:37.160 --> 35:40.280]  going to do what's wrong because that is the plan
[35:40.280 --> 35:43.800]  yeah i mean that's 99 percent of the time countries are tyrannies
[35:43.800 --> 35:48.840]  liberty is a very rare jewel okay sir uh representative joel bonnick
[35:48.840 --> 35:52.280]  how do people help you get this pro second amendment
[35:52.280 --> 35:56.840]  resolution pro industry movement pro tent amendment resolution passed
[35:56.840 --> 36:00.840]  how do we help montana uh get the other one passive a lot of listeners in
[36:00.840 --> 36:05.000]  montana uh and uh it doesn't matter where you are you can get his resolution
[36:05.000 --> 36:08.120]  and try to get it passed in your state this is very popular
[36:08.120 --> 36:11.240]  tell us how we do that sir okay there are two things
[36:11.240 --> 36:14.440]  first of all become informed if you go to your website
[36:14.440 --> 36:17.960]  at the montana government website it is le g
[36:17.960 --> 36:24.360]  dot m t dot gov and on that website you can track the bills you can find out
[36:24.360 --> 36:29.080]  who voted for it who voted against it where it is in process which committee
[36:29.080 --> 36:32.040]  it will be heard in and which house it will be heard in
[36:32.040 --> 36:36.840]  and uh you can get up to speed on uh reading the text of the bill
[36:36.840 --> 36:43.720]  and that is le g dot m t dot gov that's the first thing to do become informed
[36:43.720 --> 36:49.560]  the second thing you can do is contact the montana shooting sports association
[36:49.560 --> 36:53.480]  this is the premier gun organization and patriot organization in montana
[36:53.480 --> 36:59.000]  arguably they've gotten uh probably 25 patriot bills passed in the last
[36:59.000 --> 37:03.960]  25 years or so and you can find that at mtssa dot
[37:03.960 --> 37:08.920]  or g montana shooting sports association they will keep you up to speed on how
[37:08.920 --> 37:11.720]  these bills are progressing how you can support them
[37:11.720 --> 37:15.400]  and um if you get involved that way you can be a real benefit to the people
[37:15.400 --> 37:19.560]  here in montana and also encouragement to people who are fighting a good fight
[37:19.560 --> 37:22.680]  here when sometimes it seems like we're going uphill
[37:22.680 --> 37:26.600]  well the goodness is we haven't going uphill but to see
[37:26.600 --> 37:34.120]  now 29 states was 20 a week ago 29 states introducing or passing
[37:34.120 --> 37:38.200]  10th amendment resolutions and the bills aren't milk toast they say
[37:38.200 --> 37:41.880]  because of plans for gun confiscation and they cite the federal move
[37:41.880 --> 37:45.480]  because of plans for national conscription they cite the move
[37:45.480 --> 37:49.160]  because of because of federal attacks on homeschooling they cite it
[37:49.160 --> 37:53.000]  because of the feds ignoring states when they try to decriminalize marijuana
[37:53.000 --> 37:59.080]  they state the case uh i mean we i'm seeing the states become educated
[37:59.080 --> 38:03.080]  yes that's right um montana the legislature only meets once for many
[38:03.080 --> 38:06.600]  days every two years and so our session is halfway through right now
[38:06.600 --> 38:10.840]  but there is a groundswell of legislative activity going here
[38:10.840 --> 38:13.480]  and we're not going to give this up even if we're not meeting
[38:13.480 --> 38:16.760]  this is going to go on and we're going to come back to a session after
[38:16.760 --> 38:21.160]  session if we have the time and whether or not the legislature leads the people
[38:21.160 --> 38:24.840]  are out there already making provisions to do what's necessary
[38:24.840 --> 38:27.960]  if we get the government support by our leaders or not
[38:27.960 --> 38:32.280]  is it montana like texas can't you call a special emergency session
[38:32.280 --> 38:35.480]  if this isn't passed to uh because things are only going to get more insane
[38:35.480 --> 38:39.080]  as the groundswell bills uh can you call a special session
[38:39.080 --> 38:43.560]  to pass uh these uh declarations of rights
[38:43.560 --> 38:46.920]  yes we can you know it's it's possible we'll have to have a special session
[38:46.920 --> 38:50.760]  anyway because the state of the economy is so bad that as we try to make a
[38:50.760 --> 38:54.360]  budget for the next two years we're aiming at a moving target
[38:54.360 --> 38:57.800]  and um if we can't have a balanced budget we'll have to come back to
[38:57.800 --> 39:03.160]  to special session and to make a balanced budget so um you know it's a
[39:03.160 --> 39:08.040]  scary time to live in well as this develops are we're going to
[39:08.040 --> 39:11.640]  track it but as you said uh it's it's got a pretty good chance of passing if
[39:11.640 --> 39:15.160]  people will just put pressure on the montana legislature
[39:15.160 --> 39:19.240]  yes that's right and i hope that people will contact those who are on the fence
[39:19.240 --> 39:23.800]  or voted against it and that they will support those who have voted yes
[39:23.800 --> 39:27.080]  and to give them encouragement i should also point out that montana has a
[39:27.080 --> 39:31.800]  strong gun rights climate here and in the heller case recently we had a brief
[39:31.800 --> 39:35.640]  or an amicus brief from the state i believe it was basically saying that
[39:35.640 --> 39:38.920]  you know this is important to us because if the federal government denies
[39:38.920 --> 39:43.000]  our constitutional rights to to uh keep firearms and keep their
[39:43.000 --> 39:46.840]  firearms that uh that breaks the contractual
[39:46.840 --> 39:50.200]  obligation that the federal government has with the state of montana
[39:50.200 --> 39:53.560]  and it's in time of incorporation and that contractual
[39:53.560 --> 39:56.840]  obligation is enshrined in our constitution in the first article
[39:56.840 --> 39:59.960]  and so it's very powerful and essentially what that means is that if you
[39:59.960 --> 40:03.800]  break the contract the union is off and the contract clearly
[40:03.800 --> 40:06.840]  spells out what our rights were at the time of the formation of the state of
[40:06.840 --> 40:09.880]  montana and if the federal government wants to break the contract well then the
[40:09.880 --> 40:13.480]  union's off well sir if you read the john warren defense
[40:13.480 --> 40:20.440]  authorization act of 2007 2008 it states that
[40:20.440 --> 40:24.760]  the military and north com will remove governors and the governors will serve
[40:24.760 --> 40:29.320]  as federal dual-headed officers that the state guards are to be federalized
[40:29.320 --> 40:32.120]  and now as you know north com is announcing that and so is the army
[40:32.120 --> 40:35.960]  war college that their new mission is to engage the american people this is
[40:35.960 --> 40:40.360]  high treason and uh
[40:40.360 --> 40:44.840]  well is your legislature becoming aware of what's going on
[40:44.840 --> 40:48.680]  many of us are yes we have an element in our legislature that is uh
[40:48.680 --> 40:53.160]  very well informed and we keep in touch and uh the movement is growing and we'd
[40:53.160 --> 40:57.080]  like to uh expand that both across the island within our own republican
[40:57.080 --> 40:59.560]  caucus to make people more and more aware of that
[40:59.560 --> 41:02.920]  and so we're going to be working on this day and night are any of the democrats
[41:02.920 --> 41:04.920]  because i've heard from other state reps we've been interviewing in the last
[41:04.920 --> 41:08.040]  couple weeks that a lot of democrats are i mean this is mainly a republican
[41:08.040 --> 41:11.640]  movement there are quite a few democrats that are joining you are aware or is
[41:11.640 --> 41:16.600]  it split on party lines in montana well we have a split house but um
[41:16.600 --> 41:20.200]  14 democrats join the republicans in passing this important states rights
[41:20.200 --> 41:25.640]  bill and representative deb kutel who is a constitutional professor she
[41:25.640 --> 41:29.960]  spoke up very eloquently in favor of it and uh brought a lot of democrats so
[41:29.960 --> 41:34.600]  with us on this bill because she's very much pro u.s constitution and state
[41:34.600 --> 41:38.360]  rights so so so which one of the states rights bills is just past the house or
[41:38.360 --> 41:42.360]  is it fully passed um it is only past second reading on the house and it
[41:42.360 --> 41:46.680]  still is up for third reading which if it can pass third reading it will go to
[41:46.680 --> 41:51.480]  the senate but uh because the government the governor's office of the attorney
[41:51.480 --> 41:55.400]  general put a fiscal note on it which means that there's going to cost money
[41:55.400 --> 41:59.000]  um it has to go to the appropriations committee for passage because of the
[41:59.000 --> 42:02.440]  budget constraints that we have and this was a purely political move in our
[42:02.440 --> 42:06.680]  minds because they wanted to charge 60 000 dollars for a declaratory judgment
[42:06.680 --> 42:11.080]  that this was a uh a legal law but they were going to farm it outside of the
[42:11.080 --> 42:16.680]  attorney general's office which you know they've got 45 50 the legislature
[42:16.680 --> 42:20.760]  created the governor the legislature created the attorney general it creates
[42:20.760 --> 42:25.480]  the laws you they don't farm it out to some lawyers to say if you can pass that
[42:25.480 --> 42:29.400]  law correct that's what makes us mad because we as a
[42:29.400 --> 42:32.520]  legislature we fund the attorney general's office and now they're going to say
[42:32.520 --> 42:35.560]  that no we can't work for you we can't defend the laws you pass we're going to
[42:35.560 --> 42:38.920]  farm it out to somebody else because it's complex and the constitutional i'm
[42:38.920 --> 42:42.680]  thinking to myself you know this is purely a political move and well this
[42:42.680 --> 42:46.600]  is this is the bureaucracy seizing the constitutional power and for those that
[42:46.600 --> 42:49.480]  haven't read the federalist papers the anti-federalist papers let me give
[42:49.480 --> 42:52.200]  somebody a newsflash we've read them on air they're gonna let the state rep go
[42:52.200 --> 42:58.680]  but i want to comment on this the legislature state and federal is the
[42:58.680 --> 43:01.880]  power because it has the greatest separation of powers
[43:01.880 --> 43:05.960]  and directly represents from the states and at the time of course senators
[43:05.960 --> 43:09.160]  were sent by the legislature as well now
[43:09.160 --> 43:13.000]  they then watered that down to co-equal with congress
[43:13.000 --> 43:17.320]  executive judicial now they claim the executive is dominant
[43:17.320 --> 43:21.240]  and that the legislature is basically ceremonial federally and that's what
[43:21.240 --> 43:26.440]  PDD 51 says that is another fraud and another
[43:26.440 --> 43:31.080]  usurping of the true just rights of the legislature
[43:31.080 --> 43:35.080]  yes and we as a legislature in montana we need to get our colleagues to
[43:35.080 --> 43:38.760]  understand that we are the lawmaking power in this day and we need to reassert
[43:38.760 --> 43:42.440]  that because um we don't want to be co-opted by the other branches and so
[43:42.440 --> 43:45.080]  it's partly an educational process here because
[43:45.080 --> 43:48.280]  these uh many of these representatives um they haven't
[43:48.280 --> 43:51.400]  taught this been taught this in school they don't know this but they get
[43:51.400 --> 43:54.440]  elected and so they have power but they don't know how to exercise it and they
[43:54.440 --> 43:57.080]  let all these lawyers from outside and these feds
[43:57.080 --> 44:00.200]  tell them it's just like our grand juries have been turned into kept
[44:00.200 --> 44:04.120]  minions of the prosecutor it's just like juries have been turned into vassals of
[44:04.120 --> 44:07.080]  the judge we need to relearn who we are
[44:07.080 --> 44:09.640]  well sir if folks want to get in touch with you how can they do that
[44:09.640 --> 44:13.960]  representative joel bonick from montana they can contact me directly with my
[44:13.960 --> 44:21.240]  email jbonikatmt.gov
[44:21.240 --> 44:25.160]  and i urge them to get in contact with the montana shooting sports association
[44:25.160 --> 44:28.600]  and follow the follow this bill and follow what we're doing there
[44:28.600 --> 44:31.640]  and that they can be kept up to date and educated how they can help
[44:31.640 --> 44:34.840]  well the governor or the attorney general stands in the way
[44:34.840 --> 44:38.920]  of the reformation of the republic you need to start a recall and remove them
[44:38.920 --> 44:42.520]  it's time to get aggressive they always tell us to lay down and shut up we need
[44:42.520 --> 44:46.040]  to get aggressive because they're being very aggressive with us in our
[44:46.040 --> 44:50.200]  constitution sir we salute you godspeed thank you very much it's been a
[44:50.200 --> 44:52.520]  pleasure to be with you pleasure to speak with you
[44:52.520 --> 44:55.800]  we are on the march ladies and gentlemen the empire is on the run
[44:55.800 --> 45:00.440]  their move against us is out of desperation now listen to me listen to
[45:00.440 --> 45:03.560]  me carefully everyone
[45:04.520 --> 45:10.440]  i remember footage in 2002 on local news it's on the web
[45:10.440 --> 45:14.360]  could search it out where it showed regular army running checkpoint
[45:14.360 --> 45:21.240]  searching citizens in iowa iowa is where they're doing some of the worst stuff
[45:21.240 --> 45:25.000]  remember the army the regular army confiscated guns in new orleans from
[45:25.000 --> 45:29.640]  high and dry people in their own homes remember that in
[45:29.640 --> 45:32.200]  illinois they've announced they're going to use the national guard and door to
[45:32.200 --> 45:35.480]  door gun searches we have governor blagojevic four
[45:35.480 --> 45:38.520]  months ago saying in the press conference we've played the audio and
[45:38.520 --> 45:41.800]  video here yes it was in the chicago
[45:41.800 --> 45:47.640]  tribune it's really happening now listen to me and listen carefully

[1:08:42.920 --> 1:08:47.560]  they can search for guns this is just incredible it's in the daily
[1:08:47.560 --> 1:08:51.320]  times herald it's also in the daily times uh
[1:08:51.320 --> 1:08:55.880]  herald and in the dispatch i want to bring up bob Chapman
[1:08:55.880 --> 1:08:58.440]  who's said one of the largest financial newsletters in the world one of the
[1:08:58.440 --> 1:09:02.520]  largest private silver and gold brokers also military
[1:09:02.520 --> 1:09:06.760]  intelligence during the cold war uh in europe and lived in south african all
[1:09:06.760 --> 1:09:09.800]  over the planet he's left the united states because of all the things that
[1:09:09.800 --> 1:09:13.160]  are happening and he helped uh fund and get the book out to an undare call
[1:09:13.160 --> 1:09:18.040]  conspiracy in the in the seventies by gary allen
[1:09:18.040 --> 1:09:21.560]  that had such a big effect on the five million copies in print
[1:09:21.560 --> 1:09:27.640]  bob uh i mean they are really doing it but the good news is i just had another
[1:09:27.640 --> 1:09:31.960]  state rep on who's got the bill through two readings it's probably going to pass
[1:09:31.960 --> 1:09:35.560]  uh in montana other states are passing it saying we're not going to allow your
[1:09:35.560 --> 1:09:38.360]  gun control in our state tent amendment declaration
[1:09:38.360 --> 1:09:41.640]  and when i talk to the state reps sometimes two or three a day
[1:09:41.640 --> 1:09:44.840]  they all go we know about the femur camps we know about pd51
[1:09:44.840 --> 1:09:48.520]  we know about john warren defense authorization act we know everything
[1:09:48.520 --> 1:09:51.800]  and this is high treason the government's out to get you we're basically
[1:09:51.800 --> 1:09:56.760]  ready for war so the good news is the globalist have gone too far
[1:09:56.760 --> 1:09:59.640]  and uh you know folks because i'll put the face on it that's real i'm not putting
[1:09:59.640 --> 1:10:03.560]  a good face on it like oh you know we're really rising we are it's the truth
[1:10:03.560 --> 1:10:08.840]  but so is the enemy bob Chapman you know if it wasn't for programs like this
[1:10:08.840 --> 1:10:12.040]  people wouldn't know especially legislators
[1:10:12.040 --> 1:10:15.640]  and it's a great move in the right direction i'm stunned
[1:10:15.640 --> 1:10:22.520]  by the alacrity of this move uh it just happened really at least in
[1:10:22.520 --> 1:10:25.560]  field of vision in the last three or four weeks although
[1:10:25.560 --> 1:10:29.000]  i'm sure that a lot of planning has gone in over the last
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:33.720]  perhaps year or two but uh there are people who are waking up waking up
[1:10:33.720 --> 1:10:40.280]  and fortunately in state legislatures and so what is it 26 27 states that are
[1:10:40.280 --> 1:10:44.600]  proposing or have passed yeah it's up to 29 now
[1:10:44.600 --> 1:10:49.960]  29 texas and uh menace for a week no no texas in minnesota just signed on the
[1:10:49.960 --> 1:10:55.160]  last 24 hours now bob i i see brzezinski saying the new
[1:10:55.160 --> 1:10:58.360]  world order is going to be threatened this is a quote
[1:10:58.360 --> 1:11:02.280]  by rioting including the united states as they learn what the bankers have done
[1:11:02.280 --> 1:11:06.600]  and he's posing like he's a good guy they want riots that's in the imf and
[1:11:06.600 --> 1:11:11.000]  world bank documents that came out in 2002 that they love to implode economies
[1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:14.360]  then cause rioting then they have a pretext for martial law
[1:11:14.360 --> 1:11:18.600]  they're doing this by design i guess they want the public to know
[1:11:18.600 --> 1:11:22.520]  the military is going after our guns i mean i guess they want to go ahead and
[1:11:22.520 --> 1:11:25.720]  have a war start and then and then the brocco bomb is going to play abraham
[1:11:25.720 --> 1:11:28.920]  lincoln crushing the states
[1:11:28.920 --> 1:11:32.280]  well i think they're going to have a hard time crushing the states because
[1:11:32.280 --> 1:11:35.400]  there's an awful lot of people in the military who are not going to go along
[1:11:35.400 --> 1:11:39.000]  with this and there's an awful lot of people out there who are very heavily
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:41.960]  armed who are not going to go along with it either
[1:11:41.960 --> 1:11:46.120]  so uh it's not going to be easy for them to affect such a thing
[1:11:46.120 --> 1:11:49.960]  but as you say the best thing to do is try to avoid
[1:11:49.960 --> 1:11:55.640]  any conflict as long as possible well also we need to expose these drills
[1:11:55.640 --> 1:11:59.320]  and get them canceled like we had in a few towns then they went after a mayor
[1:11:59.320 --> 1:12:02.680]  i forget what it was it was it in michigan who they were going to urban
[1:12:02.680 --> 1:12:06.040]  warfare takeover drills there and he said look at scarce people this is for
[1:12:06.040 --> 1:12:09.080]  martial law history calling the commie and things on the news
[1:12:09.080 --> 1:12:12.680]  i mean we i'm gonna give the numbers out later we've got a call these police
[1:12:12.680 --> 1:12:16.360]  chiefs these military people and say look just like we did with the marines
[1:12:16.360 --> 1:12:20.360]  running checkpoints in california uh you know deep in the state
[1:12:20.360 --> 1:12:22.600]  and then they said okay we're going to cancel it but then they went ahead and
[1:12:22.600 --> 1:12:26.280]  did it anyways they did this is treason
[1:12:26.280 --> 1:12:31.000]  yeah and incidentally this sort of thing is going on in a lot of countries
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:34.680]  uh well you know it's uh they're doing it in columbia
[1:12:34.680 --> 1:12:42.200]  and uh in argentina uh venezuela bolivia um
[1:12:42.200 --> 1:12:45.320]  of course there's different reasons and different places for happening
[1:12:45.320 --> 1:12:49.640]  in mexico of course mexico's had problems as of late uh
[1:12:49.640 --> 1:12:54.280]  they've had a uh conflict going between government and the
[1:12:54.280 --> 1:13:00.120]  narcotics traffickers but uh you know the presence of troops in the streets
[1:13:00.120 --> 1:13:04.280]  for various reasons are appearing in many countries
[1:13:04.280 --> 1:13:07.400]  well they're imploding the economy about design
[1:13:07.400 --> 1:13:11.560]  and you know i just imagine the yuppies bob who still think we're conspiracy
[1:13:11.560 --> 1:13:14.920]  theorist and just deny everything and even think the economy is wonderful
[1:13:14.920 --> 1:13:18.840]  what are they going to do because tyranny is always about bankrupting the
[1:13:18.840 --> 1:13:22.680]  majority of people and enslaving folks what are all the bootlickers going to
[1:13:22.680 --> 1:13:25.640]  do when they find out they weren't special little protected
[1:13:25.640 --> 1:13:29.400]  creatures and that they're going to have their financial at least guts stomped
[1:13:29.400 --> 1:13:33.000]  out well i think they'll probably be happy
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:35.720]  because they'll probably be at one of the major
[1:13:35.720 --> 1:13:40.520]  internment camps which i was told yesterday by somebody on the inside at
[1:13:40.520 --> 1:13:44.280]  the six major camps and these are big ones
[1:13:44.280 --> 1:13:47.320]  well no no that was in the bill that was in the bill that they've introduced
[1:13:47.320 --> 1:13:50.600]  they've already built them uh yeah there's six major ones with
[1:13:50.600 --> 1:13:55.000]  over a hundred sub camps so yes that's right yeah and uh
[1:13:55.000 --> 1:13:59.000]  in fact uh the information i got was out of fort bragg
[1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:03.640]  and it ties in with i i got a call in another program
[1:14:03.640 --> 1:14:07.320]  from a lady whose husband is a field grade officer
[1:14:07.320 --> 1:14:11.800]  and she said i went up to the commissary this morning
[1:14:11.800 --> 1:14:17.080]  and what happened was that uh they were eight of these giant trailers there
[1:14:17.080 --> 1:14:21.560]  unloading freeze dried and dehydrated foods
[1:14:22.760 --> 1:14:26.440]  well we've confirmed that power plants all part of infrastructure protection
[1:14:26.440 --> 1:14:31.160]  are hoarding storable food ammo weapons that's all now public under the infregard
[1:14:31.160 --> 1:14:34.920]  system 25 000 executives have a semi-automatic
[1:14:34.920 --> 1:14:39.880]  issued fbi rifles and handguns and have licensed to kill orders list of people
[1:14:39.880 --> 1:14:43.560]  given to them inside their companies
[1:14:43.560 --> 1:14:47.640]  well it's believable and it's happening
[1:14:47.640 --> 1:14:51.480]  and uh that you know all we can do is inform everybody
[1:14:51.480 --> 1:14:55.080]  and hope that the state legislatures act
[1:14:55.080 --> 1:14:58.840]  well can you imagine if they actually try to have executives
[1:14:58.840 --> 1:15:02.920]  playing the part of 007 go kill people in their company
[1:15:02.920 --> 1:15:06.920]  i mean that was in the news it came out i mean this is this is a total
[1:15:06.920 --> 1:15:13.000]  criminal takeover can you imagine these idiots executives on power trips
[1:15:13.000 --> 1:15:16.920]  with their little infregard pass their little submachine gun in their drawer
[1:15:16.920 --> 1:15:20.760]  just thinking about who they're going to kill
[1:15:20.760 --> 1:15:25.320]  it's unbelievable but it's believable because it's happening
[1:15:25.320 --> 1:15:28.120]  well this is just what israel and the globalist in the u.s are doing when
[1:15:28.120 --> 1:15:31.880]  israel announced in the london telegraph and haraq's uh monday
[1:15:31.880 --> 1:15:36.360]  they said we are going to stage terror attacks in iran
[1:15:36.360 --> 1:15:40.200]  shoot people attack police stations and try to destabilize the country
[1:15:40.200 --> 1:15:42.920]  that's all they're gearing up for here and you know they're going to stage
[1:15:42.920 --> 1:15:47.080]  attacks on police and military and blaming on us bob
[1:15:49.240 --> 1:15:53.240]  you know you're really up on this stuff you know this this is not appearing
[1:15:53.240 --> 1:15:56.600]  anyplace else did you know that
[1:15:57.640 --> 1:16:01.400]  well i've just been studying them like you bob
[1:16:01.400 --> 1:16:06.840]  yeah but your information is just uh so current and so in depth
[1:16:06.840 --> 1:16:10.600]  and i just my head is off to you i don't know how you do it
[1:16:10.600 --> 1:16:15.000]  well my coming i i'm coming kind of coming up behind you
[1:16:15.000 --> 1:16:18.120]  well no bob it's just that when you know they're building camps and they're
[1:16:18.120 --> 1:16:20.760]  doing all this and you know i've been you know you're an expert on financial
[1:16:20.760 --> 1:16:23.960]  stuff and a lot of other areas in security i've just
[1:16:23.960 --> 1:16:27.320]  learned about the military making payoffs in the late 90s
[1:16:27.320 --> 1:16:30.840]  to city officials all over texas and found out it was true and then people
[1:16:30.840 --> 1:16:34.840]  call me a conspiracy terrorist so i just ran into this you know you you you
[1:16:34.840 --> 1:16:38.840]  run into something and then over 12 13 years you learn about it
[1:16:38.840 --> 1:16:42.680]  it's just so sick bob i know and you know
[1:16:42.680 --> 1:16:45.960]  the same thing is happening in the financial or my goodness gracious
[1:16:45.960 --> 1:16:49.800]  that we've got one uh scanned the laughter another and
[1:16:49.800 --> 1:16:55.000]  and there's going to be hundreds of them um you know i saw today that the fbi is
[1:16:55.000 --> 1:17:00.040]  working on uh i don't know 3,500 cases that are
[1:17:00.040 --> 1:17:03.080]  tied to the you know the collapse in the stock market
[1:17:03.080 --> 1:17:06.120]  which incidentally uh today is hitting new lows
[1:17:06.120 --> 1:17:09.320]  and gold has gone over a thousand dollars an ounce
[1:17:09.320 --> 1:17:13.080]  and i'm sure glad alex said on your program that you had ten
[1:17:13.080 --> 1:17:17.320]  so many more people were able to buy coins at cheaper prices
[1:17:17.320 --> 1:17:21.320]  um i come up with something this morning on the banking system
[1:17:21.320 --> 1:17:28.200]  and um this is a real lolapalooza uh the um the administration
[1:17:28.200 --> 1:17:33.880]  is going to jump start a program whereby they're going to give
[1:17:33.880 --> 1:17:39.480]  uh over a trillion dollars probably about 1.9 almost two trillion dollars
[1:17:39.480 --> 1:17:44.520]  to hedge funds so that they can lend the money to banks
[1:17:44.520 --> 1:17:48.840]  so that banks can lend to people of course the banks have lots of money
[1:17:48.840 --> 1:17:52.680]  uh you know sitting on their balance sheet most of it sitting with the fed
[1:17:52.680 --> 1:17:56.360]  making interest and they're not lending it because they want to keep it you know
[1:17:56.360 --> 1:18:00.760]  a strong balance sheet but you know this is absolute madness
[1:18:00.760 --> 1:18:04.440]  and then what they do is they the hedge funds go out and buy
[1:18:04.440 --> 1:18:06.680]  real assets which they're doing and that's why they won't say where the
[1:18:06.680 --> 1:18:10.920]  money's going i mean this is open criminal looting of everything
[1:18:10.920 --> 1:18:15.560]  with the army standing by and training to take our guns i mean
[1:18:15.560 --> 1:18:18.680]  i just want to slap these yuppies upside the head that call us conspiracy
[1:18:18.680 --> 1:18:22.040]  theorist i am so sick of these cowardly people bob
[1:18:22.040 --> 1:18:27.000]  because of them standing down they allow this to happen well you know we're
[1:18:27.000 --> 1:18:32.280]  only dealing with facts it's as simple as that we don't
[1:18:32.280 --> 1:18:37.640]  make this stuff up every morning and you know in all fronts so to speak i mean
[1:18:37.640 --> 1:18:40.120]  there's so much going on it's incredible you know

[1:25:12.680 --> 1:25:16.120]  their manuals i mean how transparent is this if i went on
[1:25:16.120 --> 1:25:18.120]  there and talked about riots every day and
[1:25:18.120 --> 1:25:21.560]  and how people basically need to have riots like brazilsky did
[1:25:21.560 --> 1:25:25.400]  i would get in trouble this guy you know they're definitely out there
[1:25:25.400 --> 1:25:29.640]  introducing this idea well i think they certainly are
[1:25:29.640 --> 1:25:33.720]  and uh and they're going to continue to push it you know they've got the major
[1:25:33.720 --> 1:25:36.440]  meteor and they'll have their programs on it and
[1:25:36.440 --> 1:25:41.160]  it'll be in the news and uh we'll just have to do our best to counterman what
[1:25:41.160 --> 1:25:44.440]  they're doing and let the people know this is what they're up to
[1:25:44.440 --> 1:25:48.760]  and don't go for the bait you know don't shoot less shot at
[1:25:48.760 --> 1:25:52.200]  well bottom line this is this is to condition the military the police and
[1:25:52.200 --> 1:25:55.640]  the locals everywhere they do this
[1:25:56.520 --> 1:26:01.240]  well the police have been uh worked upon for the last several years in
[1:26:01.240 --> 1:26:06.920]  particular on this and um so it's nothing new to them
[1:26:06.920 --> 1:26:11.080]  and i think uh most of them don't like it but uh there's not much they can
[1:26:11.080 --> 1:26:15.720]  do about it without losing their jobs and so that's the
[1:26:15.720 --> 1:26:21.000]  predicament that they're in and uh i don't think that uh
[1:26:21.000 --> 1:26:23.880]  they want to go with the government because if they do uh they're going to
[1:26:23.880 --> 1:26:28.520]  have a serious problem because i you know this business of writing and
[1:26:28.520 --> 1:26:31.160]  demonstrations if they want to have it it's going to be
[1:26:31.160 --> 1:26:35.880]  unavoidable and they'll have it if they want it
[1:26:35.880 --> 1:26:40.280]  and it won't be a reaction from the public uh it'll be something they plan
[1:26:40.280 --> 1:26:45.160]  like you know a false flag operation or a black ops operation
[1:26:45.160 --> 1:26:49.080]  and it it could happen easily and so
[1:26:49.080 --> 1:26:52.920]  by telling people what they're up to at least people will be prepared for the
[1:26:52.920 --> 1:26:58.120]  possibility that the government might do something like this
[1:26:58.120 --> 1:27:03.320]  let me read a quote by sir joseph stamp director of the bank of england the
[1:27:03.320 --> 1:27:07.560]  private bank appointed in 1928 banking was conceived in
[1:27:07.560 --> 1:27:11.720]  iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth
[1:27:11.720 --> 1:27:15.480]  take it away from them but leave them the power to create money
[1:27:15.480 --> 1:27:19.000]  and with the flick of a pin they will create enough deposits to buy it back
[1:27:19.000 --> 1:27:22.360]  again however take it away from them and all the
[1:27:22.360 --> 1:27:26.120]  great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear
[1:27:26.120 --> 1:27:29.560]  for this would be a happier and better world to live in
[1:27:29.560 --> 1:27:32.680]  but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers
[1:27:32.680 --> 1:27:36.920]  and pay the cost of your own slavery let them constitute to create money sir
[1:27:36.920 --> 1:27:39.080]  joseph stamp director of the bank of england
[1:27:39.080 --> 1:27:42.920]  1928 and when he was appointed he wrote this after he left
[1:27:42.920 --> 1:27:47.000]  um this is on record you know this is a documented quote
[1:27:47.000 --> 1:27:50.440]  that folks they just create fake money and buy everything
[1:27:50.440 --> 1:27:56.040]  and then they plunge economies so they can get your physical assets i mean bob
[1:27:56.040 --> 1:27:59.400]  people need to understand i want you to put your own words there is nothing we
[1:27:59.400 --> 1:28:01.880]  can do but resist this they will give us no quarter
[1:28:01.880 --> 1:28:07.800]  they will completely bankrupt us like people living in bombay india
[1:28:07.800 --> 1:28:10.920]  well there's no question about that and there is
[1:28:10.920 --> 1:28:15.800]  plenty of a status historical data for people who want to go back and look at
[1:28:15.800 --> 1:28:19.080]  it now this goes back and recorded history
[1:28:19.080 --> 1:28:23.800]  as far as i can find for a thousand years
[1:28:23.800 --> 1:28:27.640]  i mean these people and it's the same families who are at the
[1:28:27.640 --> 1:28:32.920]  at the nexus of all this and they're the same ones who are doing it again
[1:28:32.920 --> 1:28:36.600]  and of course each generation they pick up another group of minions that they
[1:28:36.600 --> 1:28:40.680]  bring into the royal institute and the council and foreign relations and the
[1:28:40.680 --> 1:28:45.800]  bill de berger group and so on and um and as you know always willing
[1:28:45.800 --> 1:28:49.320]  hands who uh want to be rich and famous
[1:28:49.320 --> 1:28:57.240]  and like our recent mr stanford uh i guess he's sir i wonder is he
[1:28:57.240 --> 1:29:00.440]  a lord
[1:29:00.440 --> 1:29:05.160]  it's sick picked up it's totally sick democrats are gonna have to put up with
[1:29:05.160 --> 1:29:10.440]  a lot on this and uh and uh because evidently he was
[1:29:10.440 --> 1:29:15.560]  uh a big contributor in those circles but you know you're going to see
[1:29:15.560 --> 1:29:20.040]  uh people on the periphery who are stealing with both hands is uh
[1:29:20.040 --> 1:29:26.200]  as you pointed out and it comes from that whole financial spectrum
[1:29:26.200 --> 1:29:29.400]  you know everybody has their own little deal and uh
[1:29:29.400 --> 1:29:33.400]  they capitalize on it bob chevin let's talk a little bit more about the
[1:29:33.400 --> 1:29:37.160]  economy we get back and i'm gonna let you go and i'm gonna go more into the

[1:33:46.600 --> 1:33:53.000]  i'm looking at the march 23rd 1775 the war is inevitable
[1:33:53.000 --> 1:33:56.120]  patrick henry speech and i'm gonna you know we've got all these guests on day
[1:33:56.120 --> 1:33:59.080]  i've got to take time out to read the whole thing because in context it's
[1:33:59.080 --> 1:34:02.040]  just beautiful and i want curtain memo and
[1:34:02.040 --> 1:34:04.600]  paul watson to post the war is inevitable
[1:34:04.600 --> 1:34:08.040]  full three page speech by patrick henry march 23rd
[1:34:08.040 --> 1:34:14.840]  1775 with lexington and concord our fleets and armies necessary to a work
[1:34:14.840 --> 1:34:18.360]  of love and reconciliation that was the crown massing trips
[1:34:18.360 --> 1:34:22.040]  have we shown ourselves so unwilling to be reconciled that force must be called
[1:34:22.040 --> 1:34:25.320]  in to win back our love
[1:34:25.320 --> 1:34:27.720]  they talked about the government kissing them and always saying it's for
[1:34:27.720 --> 1:34:32.760]  their own good while brutalizing people i mean folks it's the same thing today
[1:34:32.760 --> 1:34:36.360]  bob Chapman i think we're on the verge of the second american revolution and i
[1:34:36.360 --> 1:34:40.760]  don't say that with pleasure because i know it's going to be horrible but
[1:34:40.760 --> 1:34:46.920]  the alternative of complete bondage is more horrible
[1:34:46.920 --> 1:34:50.840]  you're absolutely correct and um me either live in your knees
[1:34:50.840 --> 1:34:55.560]  or you get freedom through fighting or death one or the other
[1:34:55.560 --> 1:34:59.800]  and i've been telling people for the last eight years exactly
[1:34:59.800 --> 1:35:04.120]  that this was going to happen and it's happened and i've been after
[1:35:04.120 --> 1:35:08.520]  thousands and thousands of radio shows and i've told people
[1:35:08.520 --> 1:35:14.200]  make sure you're heavily armed and uh have plenty of ammo and clips and food
[1:35:14.200 --> 1:35:20.680]  and a method of uh purifying water because you may well need it and it's
[1:35:20.680 --> 1:35:23.800]  come to that point where we may well need it
[1:35:23.800 --> 1:35:28.040]  now they are pushing very very hard i don't know exactly what their timetable
[1:35:28.040 --> 1:35:32.520]  is i don't think anybody does but it's getting closer and closer
[1:35:32.520 --> 1:35:36.360]  um sometimes these sorts of things
[1:35:36.360 --> 1:35:40.520]  can roll out over a year or two uh it's hard to tell
[1:35:40.520 --> 1:35:43.560]  you know when you when you see them you think it's eminent
[1:35:43.560 --> 1:35:47.480]  and but sometimes it isn't and we're getting warnings from people like
[1:35:47.480 --> 1:35:51.800]  bryzhninsky and uh i'm sure others will come probably
[1:35:51.800 --> 1:35:56.440]  from henry kissinger and and people like him
[1:35:56.440 --> 1:36:00.040]  and that'll probably go on for for a while and then all of a sudden we'll
[1:36:00.040 --> 1:36:03.480]  have our event and it might not even be
[1:36:03.480 --> 1:36:08.040]  triggered uh uh by government upon the people
[1:36:08.040 --> 1:36:13.960]  that may well be triggered by groups within the country who are anti
[1:36:13.960 --> 1:36:18.840]  us that they know about that they leave in place
[1:36:18.840 --> 1:36:22.200]  so that they can go out and do nasty things like that
[1:36:22.200 --> 1:36:26.760]  and so we just don't know we'll take israel net and yahoo has now become
[1:36:26.760 --> 1:36:31.080]  the new prime minister of israel and he's saying he's going after iran
[1:36:31.080 --> 1:36:36.120]  well nothing yahoo is the nazi they have a fascist state in israel
[1:36:36.120 --> 1:36:40.840]  and it's to be expected he's a former well probably still a cia operative
[1:36:40.840 --> 1:36:45.160]  and work with them aside so you can well expect that
[1:36:45.160 --> 1:36:49.160]  and uh the people of israel realize but you know that's what they want that's
[1:36:49.160 --> 1:36:53.960]  what they want well it's just amazing um how
[1:36:53.960 --> 1:36:57.640]  bad do you think the economy is going to get in the next six months
[1:36:57.640 --> 1:37:01.720]  well i'm i think we're looking at twenty two percent unemployment maybe a
[1:37:01.720 --> 1:37:05.400]  little higher uh but i i think i'm safe on the
[1:37:05.400 --> 1:37:09.720]  intermediate unemployment at twenty two percent following it'll be
[1:37:09.720 --> 1:37:12.920]  over thirty if we're not you know running around
[1:37:12.920 --> 1:37:17.160]  killing people and um uh inflation is going to
[1:37:17.160 --> 1:37:19.960]  rear back up against starting in march of april
[1:37:19.960 --> 1:37:23.160]  and uh because all the money that's being poured into the system and that's
[1:37:23.160 --> 1:37:28.360]  my gold is over a thousand dollars today and uh it's probably going to go
[1:37:28.360 --> 1:37:32.600]  considerably higher and i uh take my head off to the
[1:37:32.600 --> 1:37:35.640]  people who made the move and did buy gold and
[1:37:35.640 --> 1:37:39.800]  and silver related assets um the stuff i know
[1:37:39.800 --> 1:37:48.200]  two years ago i said that i felt that uh in two years uh that the
[1:37:48.200 --> 1:37:53.400]  the dow jones industrial average of seven thousand two hundred and sixty eight
[1:37:53.400 --> 1:37:56.600]  would be broken and that was the low during two
[1:37:56.600 --> 1:38:01.160]  oh oh three and so that's considered a support level
[1:38:01.160 --> 1:38:05.560]  uh it's trading at exactly that level right now
[1:38:05.560 --> 1:38:09.160]  and that's when i announced that i thought the recession had begun which
[1:38:09.160 --> 1:38:14.440]  was two years ago and uh of course i also announced
[1:38:14.440 --> 1:38:17.400]  when the market was at its high a year and a half ago
[1:38:17.400 --> 1:38:21.800]  that we everybody should get out of the regular stock market
[1:38:21.800 --> 1:38:25.240]  with the exception of gold and silver shares um
[1:38:25.240 --> 1:38:29.400]  at fourteen thousand uh where are we going um
[1:38:29.400 --> 1:38:33.480]  next stop on the dow is probably six thousand to sixty six hundred
[1:38:33.480 --> 1:38:37.880]  somewhere in there and then on the way down it it won't accelerate and less
[1:38:37.880 --> 1:38:41.240]  than some pretty pretty bad bad events happen
[1:38:41.240 --> 1:38:45.880]  like we've just discussed i mean we start getting shooting going on
[1:38:45.880 --> 1:38:51.240]  uh any kind of uh something that looks like irregular warfare or a revolution
[1:38:51.240 --> 1:38:55.480]  um the market could drop to a thousand and so
[1:38:55.480 --> 1:38:59.560]  you know those of you who have monies in the market
[1:38:59.560 --> 1:39:03.880]  and regular stocks uh life insurance policies

[1:40:47.160 --> 1:40:52.360]  according what i'm saying is the banks a big concern over the nationalization
[1:40:52.360 --> 1:40:58.600]  of the banks which is of people are selling due to that fact so
[1:40:58.600 --> 1:41:02.680]  it's pretty pretty pretty tough market i don't know i mean i i look at this thing
[1:41:02.680 --> 1:41:06.200]  and and uh you know i mean i was i'm not old enough to remember what happened

[1:41:57.320 --> 1:42:00.520]  level that you bought with it over $1,000 an ounce now
[1:42:00.520 --> 1:42:04.040]  hey alex i gave my word and my word is my word
[1:42:04.040 --> 1:42:07.400]  and your gold is up another ten dollars since the last time i said that
[1:42:07.400 --> 1:42:10.360]  ted this is an it's just insane i just can't believe
[1:42:10.360 --> 1:42:13.960]  that you're offering gold at this price and i can't imagine your competition
[1:42:13.960 --> 1:42:16.920]  must be cringing right now well i don't i don't think there's
[1:42:16.920 --> 1:42:20.760]  anybody out there that'll take on this position but i will hold all the way
[1:42:20.760 --> 1:42:24.280]  through sunday i mean if you want your last chance to get in i don't know how
[1:42:24.280 --> 1:42:27.960]  i can make it any better than this for you it's not only just the gold
[1:42:27.960 --> 1:42:31.160]  i mean the silver has twice as much pressure because it went up as a
[1:42:31.160 --> 1:42:35.320]  percentage much higher the silver position that i have is just
[1:42:35.320 --> 1:42:39.320]  unbelievable unbelievable and if you want something that's
[1:42:39.320 --> 1:42:42.440]  going to buy you the food and the groceries that you need
[1:42:42.440 --> 1:42:45.720]  in the future you this is the stuff that you're going to need
[1:42:45.720 --> 1:42:50.040]  the gold is a fabulous buy i mean we have a few little other items that i left
[1:42:50.040 --> 1:42:53.400]  on the list as well i don't even dare mention there's
[1:42:53.400 --> 1:42:56.360]  just some there's like some twenty dollar liberties and some ten dollar
[1:42:56.360 --> 1:43:00.840]  liberties and some us eagles and and you know
[1:43:00.840 --> 1:43:08.120]  actually i picked up a quantity of of the chinese panda here
[1:43:08.120 --> 1:43:12.280]  about a hundred grand worth you know that stuff is priced at jeez i must have
[1:43:12.280 --> 1:43:17.000]  picked it up at nine twenty you know and and you know all this all the stuff
[1:43:17.000 --> 1:43:21.080]  that i've been accumulating it doesn't make me you know it it sort of
[1:43:21.080 --> 1:43:24.920]  depresses me to see the markets moving the way the way that they're going i
[1:43:24.920 --> 1:43:28.040]  mean i i've got two brothers that are unemployed
[1:43:28.040 --> 1:43:30.840]  right now that are in the construction business
[1:43:30.840 --> 1:43:33.480]  and uh... you know they don't know where they're next you know that they're
[1:43:33.480 --> 1:43:36.280]  where the next meals coming from hardly you know i mean that's
[1:43:36.280 --> 1:43:39.400]  they're they're getting this unemployment benefit stuff and all that but
[1:43:39.400 --> 1:43:43.640]  you know that there's just way too much money being printed
[1:43:43.640 --> 1:43:48.360]  and uh... there's just too many bailouts that are coming from washington dc
[1:43:48.360 --> 1:43:52.280]  the entire world is looking at the united states melting apart
[1:43:52.280 --> 1:43:55.720]  they're trying to get out of it it's it's surprising to me that they still run to
[1:43:55.720 --> 1:43:59.960]  us treasuries i would i still see the dollar climbing as the gold climbs
[1:43:59.960 --> 1:44:02.760]  but i don't know i mean you can and bob probably can
[1:44:02.760 --> 1:44:06.040]  elaborate on this but eventually that's going to break apart gold's going to go
[1:44:06.040 --> 1:44:08.600]  up in the dollar is just going to come tumbling down
[1:44:08.600 --> 1:44:12.200]  that's when you start to see that inflation that bob's describing
[1:44:12.200 --> 1:44:15.800]  um you know where people are definitely fleeing or
[1:44:15.800 --> 1:44:19.960]  are there they're they're flying into uh... into uh...
[1:44:19.960 --> 1:44:24.200]  quality assets and one of the things they still view as quality is the u.s
[1:44:24.200 --> 1:44:26.120]  government securities but
[1:44:26.120 --> 1:44:28.680]  and i don't know how i don't know how anybody in the right mind can think of
[1:44:28.680 --> 1:44:31.960]  it that way the united states government is so broke right now
[1:44:31.960 --> 1:44:35.160]  and uh... and if you know these big bailouts are
[1:44:35.160 --> 1:44:39.560]  are just going to drive you know it it makes our credibility this is the mass
[1:44:39.560 --> 1:44:44.200]  looting will folks i hope you call before that's all gone at this price
[1:44:44.200 --> 1:44:48.280]  eight hundred six eight six two two three seven eight hundred six eight six

[1:45:16.280 --> 1:45:20.760]  i am was impressed talking to these guys yesterday when they were here
[1:45:20.760 --> 1:45:24.920]  uh... they're the conspiracy hunters is the name of the show they're producing
[1:45:24.920 --> 1:45:28.360]  for australian television we also had an independent film channel here doing a
[1:45:28.360 --> 1:45:31.720]  profile on myself in operation yesterday so it was quite a circus had a lot of
[1:45:31.720 --> 1:45:35.160]  fun went downtown last night boy was six street dead we were down there to talk
[1:45:35.160 --> 1:45:37.000]  to folks about obama and get their take on them
[1:45:37.000 --> 1:45:40.440]  i've never seen uh... even during the middle of the day six street
[1:45:40.440 --> 1:45:45.400]  uh... that dead but uh... i wanted to have these guys in here to talk about
[1:45:45.400 --> 1:45:47.880]  what it was like to have their guns almost all of them
[1:45:47.880 --> 1:45:51.160]  confiscated and i guess single shots highly regulated crocodile dundee the
[1:45:51.160 --> 1:45:52.200]  real guy that that
[1:45:52.200 --> 1:45:58.040]  movies based on uh... wouldn't turn his guns in so they came out and
[1:45:58.040 --> 1:46:01.160]  surrounded his house and killed him reading that in the nr a magazine a
[1:46:01.160 --> 1:46:04.600]  long time ago uh... and now they're openly saying they're gonna have quote
[1:46:04.600 --> 1:46:08.440]  chinese net style censorship we can only visit a few thousand sites basically
[1:46:08.440 --> 1:46:12.120]  canada's now announcing that so you know you guys are under the crown
[1:46:12.120 --> 1:46:13.720]  we're talking last night you said
[1:46:13.720 --> 1:46:18.280]  a lot of australian say what you need uh... is uh...
[1:46:18.280 --> 1:46:20.600]  when the revolution like the united states happening and i was talking to
[1:46:20.600 --> 1:46:22.440]  you guys you were saying what i've heard from other
[1:46:22.440 --> 1:46:26.200]  policies uh... is that the police the military everybody knows the government's
[1:46:26.200 --> 1:46:28.760]  creptin bad nobody likes the government
[1:46:28.760 --> 1:46:31.560]  uh... one of your guys was saying that if you have an anti-government bumper
[1:46:31.560 --> 1:46:35.000]  sticker you don't get taken to jail or find like you do here
[1:46:35.000 --> 1:46:38.360]  uh... that you know the cop by a beer but you're not supposed to
[1:46:38.360 --> 1:46:41.960]  buck the system so it's kind of like all the polite go along with it so
[1:46:41.960 --> 1:46:45.800]  strange psychology uh... but uh... policies don't have a reputation of being
[1:46:45.800 --> 1:46:48.600]  gilded so how was how did this happen
[1:46:48.600 --> 1:46:51.800]  uh... to you guys uh... over there how is it now happening here in the united
[1:46:51.800 --> 1:46:54.920]  states i want to uh... welcome uh... craig proudly
[1:46:54.920 --> 1:46:58.120]  and of course a shan casing her uh... here in studio with the skies good to
[1:46:58.120 --> 1:47:00.440]  have you
[1:47:00.440 --> 1:47:04.120]  real pleasure to be here and good to have you here uh... now uh... uh...
[1:47:04.120 --> 1:47:07.800]  shan grew up in the states but then has lived in australia a long time has now
[1:47:07.800 --> 1:47:09.160]  getting married over there and
[1:47:09.160 --> 1:47:13.160]  you know went to school there and uh... uh... but of course uh... craig and
[1:47:13.160 --> 1:47:16.920]  uh... tell me about the rest of your crew that's all also here
[1:47:16.920 --> 1:47:21.480]  uh... we're here shooting we've been to alberton georgia uh... san josei uh...
[1:47:21.480 --> 1:47:25.400]  san francisco uh... we got a crew outside uh... so we're doing a show right
[1:47:25.400 --> 1:47:28.920]  across america in a very short period of time
[1:47:28.920 --> 1:47:32.200]  absolutely folks can see my hands waving on screens i'm saying direct the camera
[1:47:32.200 --> 1:47:34.600]  a little bit over there more on them
[1:47:34.600 --> 1:47:38.440]  uh... gotta make that point folks i think i'm doing secret codes or something
[1:47:38.440 --> 1:47:42.920]  uh... what is this it's masonic where uh... but uh... actually i like to jump
[1:47:42.920 --> 1:47:45.720]  in there uh... i'm american as you can hear from my voice
[1:47:45.720 --> 1:47:48.920]  uh... i'm actually texan but i've lived in australia for about ten years
[1:47:48.920 --> 1:47:51.880]  you've picked up part of the accident and now and i've got some strange hybrid
[1:47:51.880 --> 1:47:53.400]  which no one understands now
[1:47:53.400 --> 1:47:57.400]  but uh... the crew we brought over is all australian including craig and it's
[1:47:57.400 --> 1:48:00.840]  the first time they've been in america so there's a real contrast between
[1:48:00.840 --> 1:48:04.360]  australian culture what they're used to in australia and now what they're running
[1:48:04.360 --> 1:48:08.440]  to in california in georgia and now in texas
[1:48:08.440 --> 1:48:12.600]  quite interesting absolutely uh... let's uh... get into the gun confiscation
[1:48:12.600 --> 1:48:15.320]  the gun restriction how you went from just like the u.s
[1:48:15.320 --> 1:48:19.880]  overnight uh... to uh... special licenses and things just to basically have a
[1:48:19.880 --> 1:48:22.360]  single shot now they're even trying to restrict those
[1:48:22.360 --> 1:48:25.720]  well australia doesn't have a bill of rights and we've never really had the
[1:48:25.720 --> 1:48:30.280]  right to bear arms but the most significant case was a famous massacre
[1:48:30.280 --> 1:48:33.720]  uh... with the gentleman called martin brides and after that incident the
[1:48:33.720 --> 1:48:35.720]  prime minister of the time john howard
[1:48:35.720 --> 1:48:39.080]  whose popularity was lagging became very popular
[1:48:39.080 --> 1:48:43.000]  by actually going out in front of big gun lobby groups and actually calling
[1:48:43.000 --> 1:48:45.480]  for certain weapons such as semi automatic
[1:48:45.480 --> 1:48:49.320]  semi automatic weapons to be taken away from the Australian population
[1:48:49.320 --> 1:48:52.760]  and large huge amounts of people
[1:48:52.760 --> 1:48:56.200]  surrendered their firearms so it's only just a few
[1:48:56.200 --> 1:49:00.440]  it's a very small gun lobby now and australia if there was tyranny
[1:49:00.440 --> 1:49:04.520]  cannot defend itself yeah when i arrived in australia in 98
[1:49:04.520 --> 1:49:08.120]  uh... it was at the very end of that and uh... it was very much a shift in
[1:49:08.120 --> 1:49:10.760]  culture was taking place i mean i met i had friends
[1:49:10.760 --> 1:49:14.680]  who who were gun collectors gunsmiths people who live down the bush did a
[1:49:14.680 --> 1:49:17.720]  lot of hunting and they were all complaining that well you know it's
[1:49:17.720 --> 1:49:20.040]  over we're handing in our guns it's happening right now
[1:49:20.040 --> 1:49:24.600]  and since 98 uh... to even be someone who talks about gun ownership
[1:49:24.600 --> 1:49:27.640]  you're basically looked at as a bit of a fool well they do that through mass
[1:49:27.640 --> 1:49:31.880]  mind control and peer pressure but notice that was a green light
[1:49:31.880 --> 1:49:34.920]  form now they're saying and we're gonna ban protests and say it's terrorism
[1:49:34.920 --> 1:49:37.800]  but we're gonna we're gonna go ahead and restrict the web
[1:49:37.800 --> 1:49:40.920]  and then now they're grabbing property i mean from what i've read you live there
[1:49:40.920 --> 1:49:44.360]  the government's just going wild yeah i mean if anyone wants to find out
[1:49:44.360 --> 1:49:47.720]  about the uh... the actual massacre if they actually google the name martin
[1:49:47.720 --> 1:49:51.960]  Bryant in conspiracy clearly staged there's a there's a massive amount of
[1:49:51.960 --> 1:49:54.680]  information about how that was staged so
[1:49:54.680 --> 1:49:58.520]  um... but as far as astralia is concerned the joke that we have on the road here
[1:49:58.520 --> 1:50:01.480]  uh... when we see something in america that we are not familiar with who we
[1:50:01.480 --> 1:50:02.920]  disagree with we just say
[1:50:02.920 --> 1:50:05.960]  well the government should legislate it because that's what happens down under
[1:50:05.960 --> 1:50:08.840]  i keep saying these guys obama's gonna fix it
[1:50:08.840 --> 1:50:12.520]  it because that's often you know even in australia that's still the thinking
[1:50:12.520 --> 1:50:15.400]  i'll look yeah things have been rough but it's gonna get better now
[1:50:15.400 --> 1:50:19.160]  well last night they were going yeah obama you were asking folks down

[1:55:10.280 --> 1:55:15.000]  two towns the two cities where this is going on in arcadia
[1:55:15.000 --> 1:55:19.480]  and then in the other town uh so i need you guys to give me the numbers for the
[1:55:19.480 --> 1:55:22.520]  town the sheriff the county's in all of it
[1:55:22.520 --> 1:55:26.040]  do we have any luck getting any of these creatures on the air
[1:55:26.040 --> 1:55:30.280]  when you try to call them no i know i i know i have the phone number

[1:55:36.040 --> 1:55:39.320]  yeah that's what i need thank you guys i mean what do you think seeing this
[1:55:39.320 --> 1:55:42.680]  where the army's gonna go door to door and and and do gun
[1:55:42.680 --> 1:55:46.440]  confiscation drills and hang up pictures of us citizens and and run
[1:55:46.440 --> 1:55:49.880]  around with checkpoints in the town with just people there in the middle of it
[1:55:49.880 --> 1:55:53.160]  i mean that's obviously acclimate them just on this trip elix we came from
[1:55:53.160 --> 1:55:55.880]  california we went to georgia or in texas now
[1:55:55.880 --> 1:55:59.160]  and you know in georgia people are talking about fighting people talk about
[1:55:59.160 --> 1:56:02.680]  resisting there's all this sense of you know we know something's going on in
[1:56:02.680 --> 1:56:06.600]  california they're all very sleepy yeah obama's gonna fix it we need to trust
[1:56:06.600 --> 1:56:09.880]  the president let's give it some time there's a real division from what i'm
[1:56:09.880 --> 1:56:13.400]  seeing i guess the scary thing is that when the
[1:56:13.400 --> 1:56:16.680]  military is used on the streets against the people in australia there's some
[1:56:16.680 --> 1:56:20.360]  indigenous communities in the center and there's been a lot of child sex issues
[1:56:20.360 --> 1:56:23.880]  so what they did is they actually sent the military into police the towns
[1:56:23.880 --> 1:56:27.800]  now we see there's a precedent for something a sign of things to come
[1:56:27.800 --> 1:56:31.320]  i remember seeing blurbs about that but but isn't it mainly the local
[1:56:31.320 --> 1:56:33.800]  governments that control the indigenous people that have been
[1:56:33.800 --> 1:56:37.320]  like cps has been grabbing their kids and like with native reservations here a
[1:56:37.320 --> 1:56:40.360]  lot of them end up dying and i've seen those articles over the years and you
[1:56:40.360 --> 1:56:43.960]  were telling me last night that now the military is policing
[1:56:43.960 --> 1:56:48.200]  all the numbers of indigenous australians is dropped from i'm not sure of the
[1:56:48.200 --> 1:56:51.800]  years but something like 300 000 to 50 000
[1:56:51.800 --> 1:56:56.360]  and like canada like our native americans which john can talk about
[1:56:56.360 --> 1:57:02.200]  uh... that's a big deal and it's really happening i mean it's
[1:57:02.200 --> 1:57:07.160]  it's the same thing that we saw in australia is now unfolding here well
[1:57:07.160 --> 1:57:10.520]  what do you guys think is going to happen is they try to go after guns they've
[1:57:10.520 --> 1:57:13.240]  got the bills introduced to ban most guns just like australia
[1:57:13.240 --> 1:57:15.880]  i mean what's going to happen with this collision of people that aren't going to
[1:57:15.880 --> 1:57:19.400]  be slaves alice have been saying this to these guys for years now
[1:57:19.400 --> 1:57:23.240]  i mean you come to texas you come to the u.s and there's this history of
[1:57:23.240 --> 1:57:27.400]  resistance and skepticism to the government even even the state of texas
[1:57:27.400 --> 1:57:30.760]  has its own unique history about resistance and fighting off the federal
[1:57:30.760 --> 1:57:34.520]  government in australia they didn't have a revolutionary war
[1:57:34.520 --> 1:57:37.560]  australians did not fight for their independence was a penal colony so people
[1:57:37.560 --> 1:57:40.120]  are used to being prisoners i guess what was given to them
[1:57:40.120 --> 1:57:43.080]  you know that their independence in which they're not an entirely independent
[1:57:43.080 --> 1:57:46.040]  nation by the way back in the seventies they were moved that
[1:57:46.040 --> 1:57:48.200]  prime minister when he wouldn't do what the queen said
[1:57:48.200 --> 1:57:51.000]  just like they just did in canada but it was the opposite he called that
[1:57:51.000 --> 1:57:54.920]  he called the queens governor in when the let when the parliament said get out
[1:57:54.920 --> 1:57:58.680]  yeah well and what i'm saying is in texas and in in the greater u.s you have
[1:57:58.680 --> 1:58:03.000]  this psychology which is all about the constitution our rights our
[1:58:03.000 --> 1:58:06.920]  skepticism towards the government what i find as an american living in australia
[1:58:06.920 --> 1:58:10.760]  is the exact opposite people basically trust and you know they may not they
[1:58:10.760 --> 1:58:14.360]  may not be skeptical of leaders but by and large they'll do what the
[1:58:14.360 --> 1:58:17.720]  government tells them to do and you mentioned the witland dismissal i mean
[1:58:17.720 --> 1:58:21.240]  it's in public record that the uh... the governor general was influenced by
[1:58:21.240 --> 1:58:24.760]  the british crown obviously is as the british crowns representative by the
[1:58:24.760 --> 1:58:27.960]  cia to dismiss the australian prime minister
[1:58:27.960 --> 1:58:31.080]  and this is eight years after another australian prime minister actually went
[1:58:31.080 --> 1:58:35.560]  swimming on a beach in victoria and went missing and his bodies have been found

[2:01:10.920 --> 2:01:16.120]  that are fighting all of this as well we have a the aussies here in studio with
[2:01:16.120 --> 2:01:19.240]  us right now i'm opening the phones up for people that have been in urban
[2:01:19.240 --> 2:01:22.360]  warfare drills folks that are in iowa people who are concerned about this on
[2:01:22.360 --> 2:01:25.960]  this subject so i want to leave the phones open and police and military
[2:01:25.960 --> 2:01:30.760]  want to call in specifically i mean you you heard me years ago all this out
[2:01:30.760 --> 2:01:33.560]  with the documents of the video and you some of you were in denial
[2:01:33.560 --> 2:01:36.600]  now you can't be in denial i'm getting a lot of military and police emailing us
[2:01:36.600 --> 2:01:38.920]  and calling us and contacting its other hosts are telling me this
[2:01:38.920 --> 2:01:42.360]  you know mainline host that that that that that finally they're coming out of
[2:01:42.360 --> 2:01:45.160]  their trans going wait a minute foreign bankers run the country they're
[2:01:45.160 --> 2:01:48.120]  looting everything this is all really happening now they're training us to
[2:01:48.120 --> 2:01:51.400]  go after the american people they're training us for roadside ids and the
[2:01:51.400 --> 2:01:53.560]  american people are gonna be fighting us soon
[2:01:53.560 --> 2:01:58.040]  why is that gentlemen well i'll tell you something about australia
[2:01:58.040 --> 2:02:01.400]  uh... it's not that it's happening now it's that it's already happened
[2:02:01.400 --> 2:02:05.160]  i mean the gun culture is all but gone in australia as far as from what i can
[2:02:05.160 --> 2:02:08.440]  tell i've been there ten years now and there's no real debate anymore about
[2:02:08.440 --> 2:02:12.040]  whether people ought to own guns i mean to get an assault rifle is virtually
[2:02:12.040 --> 2:02:15.400]  impossible uh... you might find the occasional person who has a
[2:02:15.400 --> 2:02:18.520]  special permit for a handgun or a hunting rifle
[2:02:18.520 --> 2:02:21.640]  but that's pretty rare and that's definitely not in the cities so there's
[2:02:21.640 --> 2:02:24.600]  no real debate the debates over in australia
[2:02:24.600 --> 2:02:28.200]  and the reason we're making the show that we're making is to deal with apathy
[2:02:28.200 --> 2:02:31.400]  and we're really worried when we speak to young people in particular and they
[2:02:31.400 --> 2:02:34.280]  just not that interested in politics they're not that interested in the future
[2:02:34.280 --> 2:02:37.960]  it's all about the here and now and we really want to respond to apathy you
[2:02:37.960 --> 2:02:40.760]  know question your government question what's going on
[2:02:40.760 --> 2:02:44.760]  question uh... every time the australian government uh... send soldiers into
[2:02:44.760 --> 2:02:48.840]  every u.s. war as they always have uh... people just don't seem to really care
[2:02:48.840 --> 2:02:51.640]  anymore and that's why we're here making the show that we're making at the
[2:02:51.640 --> 2:02:54.600]  moment you might even say that australia is kind of a picture of where the u.s.
[2:02:54.600 --> 2:02:59.720]  is going to be in a few years now shawnd are both of you college teachers
[2:02:59.720 --> 2:03:02.120]  we teach occasionally both that we're both working film and television
[2:03:02.120 --> 2:03:04.280]  industry and so sometimes we teach at a university
[2:03:04.280 --> 2:03:07.960]  uh... you've shown terror storm right i've shown terror storm in a public setting
[2:03:07.960 --> 2:03:09.560]  about five hundred people
[2:03:09.560 --> 2:03:13.640]  uh... i'll tell you something uh... you've never seen a group divided
[2:03:13.640 --> 2:03:16.280]  so quickly as when you show something like terror storm
[2:03:16.280 --> 2:03:20.120]  and quite frankly i think it's all about world view some people just decide in
[2:03:20.120 --> 2:03:23.160]  advance these things can't be true so you must be wrong
[2:03:23.160 --> 2:03:26.280]  and the other half have already been suspicious for some time
[2:03:26.280 --> 2:03:30.120]  and now it's reinforcing their view but i mean in the film we have like
[2:03:30.120 --> 2:03:34.200]  mainstream times of london where it's admitted that
[2:03:34.200 --> 2:03:38.760]  british special forces uh... s a s were caught dressed up like arabs running
[2:03:38.760 --> 2:03:41.160]  around shooting and killing people to blame it on the
[2:03:41.160 --> 2:03:46.280]  people in buzzer i mean it's admitted i don't understand the
[2:03:46.280 --> 2:03:49.400]  it's not a conspiracy theory well let me tell you what i run into because we're
[2:03:49.400 --> 2:03:51.960]  talking about students now you're talking about your average eighteen to
[2:03:51.960 --> 2:03:54.440]  twenty five year old and it's classic double think
[2:03:54.440 --> 2:03:58.200]  i see the facts being presented to me i see what you're saying yes the cop did
[2:03:58.200 --> 2:04:01.640]  say that the lady did say that we we see the information being laid out in
[2:04:01.640 --> 2:04:05.240]  front of me but you know isn't that just your interpretation
[2:04:05.240 --> 2:04:09.080]  i mean this is a really common postmodern way of seeing things now
[2:04:09.080 --> 2:04:12.760]  isn't that just your interpretation of the facts and you know can't i have
[2:04:12.760 --> 2:04:15.880]  another interpretation of the facts i have these endless debates like that
[2:04:15.880 --> 2:04:19.080]  with students it's delusional yeah because in reality what happens is
[2:04:19.080 --> 2:04:23.320]  there's no objective truth anymore it's simply a whole lot of opinions
[2:04:23.320 --> 2:04:26.840]  we are changing other nine eleven groups are really expanding in australia
[2:04:26.840 --> 2:04:29.400]  though so people are starting to wake up at least some of them
[2:04:29.400 --> 2:04:32.280]  they took a little while to crop up but there was a first nine eleven truth
[2:04:32.280 --> 2:04:35.480]  conference that we both went to in march last year
[2:04:35.480 --> 2:04:38.760]  it was pretty poorly attended to be quite honest although we had some
[2:04:38.760 --> 2:04:42.040]  incredible guests like dr bob bowman and geowood griffin
[2:04:42.040 --> 2:04:45.000]  and i know they are having another conference it's run by truth action
[2:04:45.000 --> 2:04:47.640]  australia is run by a terrific bloke called john berstle
[2:04:47.640 --> 2:04:51.720]  and this year i think they have steven jones and possibly lucradowski i love
[2:04:51.720 --> 2:04:54.920]  it bloke
[2:04:55.000 --> 2:04:58.200]  all right we're gonna come right back after this quick break with our guest in

[2:08:19.880 --> 2:08:25.080]  with this situation john and iowa nathan and iowa
[2:08:25.080 --> 2:08:28.840]  brian and montreal gary and indiana page
[2:08:28.840 --> 2:08:31.960]  in the kingdom of heaven that's folks that say they're off the grid out of the
[2:08:31.960 --> 2:08:38.040]  system um we've got uh craig and paul here
[2:08:38.040 --> 2:08:41.640]  from what's the name of your media group i keep trying to remember that it's a
[2:08:41.640 --> 2:08:44.600]  great name it's tactical recon dot com dot au
[2:08:44.600 --> 2:08:50.040]  we're going to get before you leave so i've got a guest
[2:08:50.040 --> 2:08:53.320]  coming on who was put in jail in about 20 minutes but it's going to be a brief
[2:08:53.320 --> 2:08:56.520]  interview who made 7-7 rumble effect and he melded out to
[2:08:56.520 --> 2:08:59.880]  some juries that were looking at the 7-7 bombing and a judge and they've
[2:08:59.880 --> 2:09:02.440]  arrested him and he just spent like a week in jail
[2:09:02.440 --> 2:09:05.560]  and he he's supposedly getting out in the next few minutes they're gonna have a
[2:09:05.560 --> 2:09:08.600]  cell phone waiting to hear exactly what happened to him and ended up being in the
[2:09:08.600 --> 2:09:12.840]  irish times in the bbc uh because he's he's in ireland uh that that this
[2:09:12.840 --> 2:09:17.560]  happened uh anthony hill so we're uh we're uh working on getting
[2:09:17.560 --> 2:09:21.640]  that done as soon as he can call in representative leo
[2:09:21.640 --> 2:09:25.400]  burman from texas texas is introduced to sovereignty resolution so we're
[2:09:25.400 --> 2:09:28.280]  trying to fight this as hard as we can as the states created the federal
[2:09:28.280 --> 2:09:31.640]  government so that's how we quote rebel is even rebelling
[2:09:31.640 --> 2:09:35.320]  when the feds rebel we spank him and put him in line and the states
[2:09:35.320 --> 2:09:39.080]  uh can dissolve the federal government with 35 states voting and then
[2:09:39.080 --> 2:09:42.360]  reconstitute however they like that's a great danger as well though because the
[2:09:42.360 --> 2:09:44.200]  globalist could get in there rewrite things when that's happening
[2:09:44.200 --> 2:09:47.080]  that's why we want state by state basis they can also individually declare
[2:09:47.080 --> 2:09:50.360]  sovereignty but still be in the union and just lay down the law and say no
[2:09:50.360 --> 2:09:53.160]  but north com says they're going to use federal troops on them see the feds have
[2:09:53.160 --> 2:09:57.400]  war-gamed all this out so before you leave us we'll probably have you most
[2:09:57.400 --> 2:10:00.280]  the rest of the hour you have time for that but we'll just pop back in with
[2:10:00.280 --> 2:10:02.600]  you guys you can comment on what you're about to hear
[2:10:02.600 --> 2:10:06.760]  uh again i've told collars who are military who are police who are upset
[2:10:06.760 --> 2:10:10.360]  about this or who like the urban warfare gun confiscation training to call in
[2:10:10.360 --> 2:10:14.280]  are people that are in iowa i've told people just last week that iowa
[2:10:14.280 --> 2:10:18.280]  is the first place i saw real regular army checkpoints on highway searching
[2:10:18.280 --> 2:10:23.080]  for weapons and guns after 9 11 and people news cameras will be shooting
[2:10:23.080 --> 2:10:25.880]  video and they walk over was on mainstream tv and they say turn
[2:10:25.880 --> 2:10:29.000]  your cameras off in fact i look for that on the web the other day but
[2:10:29.000 --> 2:10:32.200]  because it's seven years old i couldn't find it maybe somebody can find the
[2:10:32.200 --> 2:10:35.000]  those iowa there's several of them newscast we do have other ones out of
[2:10:35.000 --> 2:10:38.840]  georgia in places but you know they do these drills and then they become real
[2:10:38.840 --> 2:10:41.400]  and it says they're gonna hang up pictures of americans
[2:10:41.400 --> 2:10:45.080]  uh... of the gun dealers looking for go door to door and ask are they in here
[2:10:45.080 --> 2:10:49.480]  and what guns do you have and then uh... and they say because of the climate in
[2:10:49.480 --> 2:10:55.480]  america today so now they're not saying these drills were for foreign wars
[2:10:55.480 --> 2:10:57.880]  because they always say that in the past the news and i'd be there it was for
[2:10:57.880 --> 2:11:01.240]  america that you admittedly to us
[2:11:01.240 --> 2:11:04.280]  one time they were given media tours over this college they taken over for
[2:11:04.280 --> 2:11:08.600]  drill in oakland and when i was there the uh... steve jones the former marine
[2:11:08.600 --> 2:11:12.040]  corps captain who was now their pr guys private civilian would run on get out of
[2:11:12.040 --> 2:11:15.560]  here jones you can't take this but then we sent a guy into the river and
[2:11:15.560 --> 2:11:19.480]  citizens tours which they're doing here uh... but this is the whole town
[2:11:19.480 --> 2:11:23.000]  and uh... that's when we got them doing executions they take americans out and
[2:11:23.000 --> 2:11:26.040]  they go all right watch this an execution and they simulate blowing
[2:11:26.040 --> 2:11:31.240]  americans heads off now that's the most hard core extreme form of martial law
[2:11:31.240 --> 2:11:34.680]  and now they announce fema camps that emerged the police the military into
[2:11:34.680 --> 2:11:37.400]  being you know this is this is in our news now
[2:11:37.400 --> 2:11:40.600]  and i know i keep just saying it over and over again because
[2:11:40.600 --> 2:11:43.800]  in a way we've been covering this so long you know it's good to report on it be
[2:11:43.800 --> 2:11:47.320]  aware of it encounter it but it's bad if people don't take action because it's
[2:11:47.320 --> 2:11:50.200]  like yeah i know they're training with camps and i i mean you know that kind of
[2:11:50.200 --> 2:11:54.760]  apathy sets in like like australia nobody likes it
[2:11:54.760 --> 2:11:58.040]  i mean how could the cops buy you a beer if you've got an anti-government sticker
[2:11:58.040 --> 2:12:00.600]  on your car but still enforce all that how does that work
[2:12:00.600 --> 2:12:04.360]  was the thing australia called a tall poppy syndrome and what that is is that
[2:12:04.360 --> 2:12:09.160]  if anyone has any success or any any i guess financial success in particular
[2:12:09.160 --> 2:12:14.520]  you gotta tear them down so it means that so we have this strange attitude where
[2:12:14.520 --> 2:12:18.920]  you know um we want success ourselves but if anyone gets it we become jealous
[2:12:18.920 --> 2:12:22.440]  it's called the tall poppy syndrome we have that here too yeah and that was
[2:12:22.440 --> 2:12:26.280]  never really a part of our culture it was you know it was very small but it's
[2:12:26.280 --> 2:12:28.920]  getting bigger i think that's a sign of sickness
[2:12:28.920 --> 2:12:33.400]  so on one hand i guess we disrespect our politicians and don't believe a lot of
[2:12:33.400 --> 2:12:36.840]  them yet we all vote for them we don't really question what they're doing
[2:12:36.840 --> 2:12:40.040]  and it's very 1984 in the concept of double think
[2:12:40.040 --> 2:12:44.280]  and again we come back to this issue of apathy we realize we're apathetic and we
[2:12:44.280 --> 2:12:47.480]  want to do something about it we get inspired by young guys and in groups
[2:12:47.480 --> 2:12:50.440]  like we are change we may not agree with everything they do
[2:12:50.440 --> 2:12:53.240]  we're inspired that young people are actually getting up and doing something
[2:12:53.240 --> 2:12:56.840]  confronting politicians in particular and we're filmmakers so we're doing
[2:12:56.840 --> 2:12:59.240]  through the mode of television film and television
[2:12:59.240 --> 2:13:01.800]  um they're doing it just with video cameras in the face of people that's
[2:13:01.800 --> 2:13:05.240]  inspiring and i think if anyone gets anything from this moment we have on the
[2:13:05.240 --> 2:13:07.880]  show is to get up and do something and stop being
[2:13:07.880 --> 2:13:12.040]  apathetic turn the television off turn on to our show but turn off all the
[2:13:12.040 --> 2:13:15.880]  rubbish that they're watching and uh just do something and talk to your
[2:13:15.880 --> 2:13:19.000]  leaders confront them and if you turn on a tv that'll make them
[2:13:19.000 --> 2:13:21.800]  start covering more of these issues you know i got pitched
[2:13:21.800 --> 2:13:25.800]  um a show called american conspiracy that's what
[2:13:25.800 --> 2:13:28.520]  vinter i need to call him up i haven't talked to him in a few months
[2:13:28.520 --> 2:13:32.600]  um and he's doing three policy one of them was that and that was the show i
[2:13:32.600 --> 2:13:35.000]  was going to do but they said we'll do with vinter which is great
[2:13:35.000 --> 2:13:37.960]  you know i don't have the tall poppy syndrome i believe the right rising
[2:13:37.960 --> 2:13:43.320]  tide raises all ships i'm excited um but um
[2:13:43.320 --> 2:13:46.120]  i've talked to these executives they go look we know this is the majority we
[2:13:46.120 --> 2:13:49.640]  know this is popular and i've talked to people where
[2:13:49.640 --> 2:13:54.280]  presidents of companies call until program directors tell you
[2:13:54.280 --> 2:13:57.240]  vice presidents you know tell uh you know the heads of
[2:13:57.240 --> 2:14:01.640]  programming you're not doing this so i mean you know the control is very very
[2:14:01.640 --> 2:14:05.240]  real i had uh a j hammer with showbiz tonight on

[2:14:43.560 --> 2:14:47.800]  uh this happened a few months ago and they just go sorry we we can't go to you
[2:14:47.800 --> 2:14:50.600]  oh so we tell people about our show conspiracy hunters when we say look
[2:14:50.600 --> 2:14:53.400]  this is what we do we we have a look at conspiracy theories some of them are
[2:14:53.400 --> 2:14:57.560]  totally wild some of them are based on very serious facts when we tell people
[2:14:57.560 --> 2:15:00.920]  what we're doing across the board people are excited people support it we run
[2:15:00.920 --> 2:15:04.360]  in almost no resistance even in the film and television industry even
[2:15:04.360 --> 2:15:08.200]  people in positions but it's that high level executive level that you're
[2:15:08.200 --> 2:15:11.640]  describing that's the unknown that's what we don't know about yet well that's a
[2:15:11.640 --> 2:15:16.280]  great name conspiracy hunters thanks a lot better than the crocodile hunter
[2:15:16.280 --> 2:15:19.320]  i think one of the uh the big things is when you just start talking to people
[2:15:19.320 --> 2:15:23.560]  about conspiracies everyone seems to have one conspiracy they believe in
[2:15:23.560 --> 2:15:26.600]  you know we talk about the show they they all name one conspiracy whether it's
[2:15:26.600 --> 2:15:30.920]  jfk or something in australia but uh they never
[2:15:30.920 --> 2:15:34.600]  believed there's a great conspiracy they somehow compartmentalize there's one
[2:15:34.600 --> 2:15:37.720]  little conspiracy but this is an open conspiracy we're gonna get more into that
[2:15:37.720 --> 2:15:41.400]  uh i've got john i've got all these calls tell me tell me who's who go ahead

[2:16:06.840 --> 2:16:09.000]  military because they always tell me they can't get in

[2:16:21.800 --> 2:16:25.080]  message for the better part of the last six seven years
[2:16:25.080 --> 2:16:29.400]  um and telling people in iowa that the new world order and world government and
[2:16:29.400 --> 2:16:33.800]  world banking uh is is stepping up to the plate now
[2:16:33.800 --> 2:16:39.960]  in in just blatant efforts to um dominate our society and take the
[2:16:39.960 --> 2:16:42.520]  rights away and people here don't believe me
[2:16:42.520 --> 2:16:46.440]  um and i give them you know basic facts most of the stuff i get from you and
[2:16:46.440 --> 2:16:49.160]  listen to what you say and research what you say
[2:16:49.160 --> 2:16:53.480]  um with what's going on in arcadia the news here
[2:16:53.480 --> 2:16:57.640]  won't report on it the news here hasn't really said anything that the uh
[2:16:57.640 --> 2:17:00.440]  newspaper up there is the first time i've seen it
[2:17:00.440 --> 2:17:05.000]  um if you you talked earlier about coming up here if you come up here
[2:17:05.000 --> 2:17:08.360]  i would love to do everything i can to help you out and work
[2:17:08.360 --> 2:17:12.280]  whatever you need done up here to prepare for that i'm a actor director and
[2:17:12.280 --> 2:17:15.800]  producer so i have access to just so you know what i do when i go to these
[2:17:15.800 --> 2:17:18.120]  events because we have feds coming up saying hey
[2:17:18.120 --> 2:17:22.040]  you want to attack and kill some police i've got weapons and i go come on fed
[2:17:22.040 --> 2:17:24.520]  i'm nonviolent don't try to set me up and then i
[2:17:24.520 --> 2:17:26.600]  start filming him and they freak out and run off
[2:17:26.600 --> 2:17:30.120]  so what i do is i kind of isolate myself i say hi to anybody that shows up i want
[2:17:30.120 --> 2:17:32.280]  folks doing their own stories their own camera work
[2:17:32.280 --> 2:17:35.400]  folks want to give us footage that's great but i trust you it's just i have
[2:17:35.400 --> 2:17:38.760]  to isolate myself when i go into one of these situations
[2:17:38.760 --> 2:17:42.760]  so we're not set up i normally i do i normally get two or three because we've
[2:17:42.760 --> 2:17:46.760]  been broken into hotel rooms and i sleep in different ones and then close them
[2:17:46.760 --> 2:17:49.400]  and move to another place i got to barricade the door at night
[2:17:49.400 --> 2:17:52.120]  because we've had them come in steal our money rob things try to plant things
[2:17:52.120 --> 2:17:55.720]  honest me this is real folks uh so i don't want to get into
[2:17:55.720 --> 2:17:58.840]  you know the things we do but you can ask the guys you know i get two three
[2:17:58.840 --> 2:18:01.800]  hotel rooms that cost money but we have to do it
[2:18:01.800 --> 2:18:05.560]  um i mean it's very very serious and they they pull fire alarms and stuff in
[2:18:05.560 --> 2:18:07.960]  the hotels we're in and you know come up to us and say
[2:18:07.960 --> 2:18:10.680]  hmm people are trying to pull fire alarms and then you
[2:18:10.680 --> 2:18:13.400]  get you know go up to your room and they pull the fire alarm i mean this is a
[2:18:13.400 --> 2:18:17.480]  kind of thing they do but yes i mean look it's in the army times are
[2:18:17.480 --> 2:18:20.840]  training troops to take over america you're saying you show that to people
[2:18:20.840 --> 2:18:25.080]  and they're still in denial they you know i it's denial they know it they see
[2:18:25.080 --> 2:18:27.800]  it you can show them the facts but people here
[2:18:27.800 --> 2:18:32.120]  um are great people yes but they are very timid and very sheepish
[2:18:32.120 --> 2:18:36.040]  um and they would much rather you know turn around and pretend like something
[2:18:36.040 --> 2:18:39.480]  isn't there uh than have to step up to the plate
[2:18:39.480 --> 2:18:42.920]  um and that's that's what we've been trying to do up here is
[2:18:42.920 --> 2:18:47.080]  is tell people what's going on and and what i pulled them is i'm afraid it's
[2:18:47.080 --> 2:18:49.560]  going to be too late by the time you guys realize
[2:18:49.560 --> 2:18:52.440]  it's time to stand up i mean they're already going to be your house is going

[2:26:13.720 --> 2:26:16.680]  going over to the state to do some work
[2:26:16.680 --> 2:26:20.120]  to do uh... inter-training with a lot of these little drills that they run
[2:26:20.120 --> 2:26:23.080]  oh by the way it's in the toronto star other papers
[2:26:23.080 --> 2:26:26.280]  that they've signed a deal and congress said last year we're not involved in
[2:26:26.280 --> 2:26:29.640]  this we would you know we make war we know we fund you we're your boss they
[2:26:29.640 --> 2:26:33.320]  said no you're not it's under pdd-51 but they will use canadian mexican troops
[2:26:33.320 --> 2:26:34.600]  in the u.s.
[2:26:34.600 --> 2:26:36.360]  record
[2:26:36.360 --> 2:26:39.960]  and one of the things that i came across this week actually contacted a friend
[2:26:39.960 --> 2:26:44.200]  on facebook and uh... he was it's funny because he was a bully back in the
[2:26:44.200 --> 2:26:45.640]  school days too
[2:26:45.640 --> 2:26:49.240]  and now he claims that he works for the federal law enforcement in the united
[2:26:49.240 --> 2:26:50.120]  states
[2:26:50.120 --> 2:26:52.600]  and he's up here training our law enforcement
[2:26:52.600 --> 2:26:55.960]  i imagine on how to kick indoors and things like that's been on the news that
[2:26:55.960 --> 2:26:57.880]  the texas state police
[2:26:57.880 --> 2:26:59.120]  are up there training
[2:26:59.120 --> 2:27:02.360]  uh... the folks in canada on how to set up checkpoints and violate rights
[2:27:02.360 --> 2:27:03.840]  thanks for the call sir
[2:27:03.840 --> 2:27:09.600]  what would australians do if they tried to use foreign troops in australia
[2:27:09.600 --> 2:27:12.440]  it's hard to say alexa mean uh...
[2:27:12.440 --> 2:27:16.280]  i'd i'd hate to say the strangers bow down and let it happen but suspect
[2:27:16.280 --> 2:27:17.760]  that's probably the case
[2:27:17.760 --> 2:27:20.600]  depends on which foreign troops if we're talking about american soldiers or
[2:27:20.600 --> 2:27:22.280]  english soldiers
[2:27:22.280 --> 2:27:25.560]  hard to say there's a lot of lot of history there with american military
[2:27:25.560 --> 2:27:27.200]  in australian military working together
[2:27:27.200 --> 2:27:30.040]  uh... anything else though i think you'll be very suspicious
[2:27:30.040 --> 2:27:32.080]  yeah macArthur rand australia
[2:27:32.080 --> 2:27:35.440]  uh... let's go ahead and talk to
[2:27:35.440 --> 2:27:38.920]  but because the ossees were armed the japanese they're not invade
[2:27:38.920 --> 2:27:41.320]  uh... let's talk to gary indiana
[2:27:41.320 --> 2:27:44.280]  gary uh... what's your take on all this
[2:27:44.280 --> 2:27:47.440]  sir thanks for taking my call uh... the reason i called today
[2:27:47.440 --> 2:27:50.120]  is this isn't just happening in iowa
[2:27:50.120 --> 2:27:53.160]  just yesterday my wife received a letter from the united states district
[2:27:53.160 --> 2:27:54.000]  court
[2:27:54.000 --> 2:27:57.920]  southern district of indiana lora a brig's uh... clerk of the court
[2:27:57.920 --> 2:28:00.160]  it's a twenty eight page questionnaire
[2:28:00.160 --> 2:28:04.200]  number fifty of is are there guns in your home yes or no
[2:28:04.200 --> 2:28:07.200]  if there are if the answer is yes please indicate whether you are another
[2:28:07.200 --> 2:28:11.120]  member of your household on guns how many guns are owned what kinds of guns
[2:28:11.120 --> 2:28:15.560]  are owned handgun rifle shotgun semi-automatic etc
[2:28:15.560 --> 2:28:17.680]  i think the reason for this is about
[2:28:17.680 --> 2:28:21.600]  a little over a year ago the a tf telephone me on my company cell phone
[2:28:21.600 --> 2:28:24.000]  which is an unpublished number if i called you on that phone that would
[2:28:24.000 --> 2:28:25.840]  give you my company name not me
[2:28:25.840 --> 2:28:29.440]  and indicated they were at my house and needed to investigate the firearms i
[2:28:29.440 --> 2:28:30.400]  owned
[2:28:30.400 --> 2:28:34.720]  so i uh... collected my wife i drove home on the way i called the deputy
[2:28:34.720 --> 2:28:36.960]  sheriff from the mine ask him to meet me there
[2:28:36.960 --> 2:28:38.480]  when i arrived at my house
[2:28:38.480 --> 2:28:42.200]  there were two sheriff cars and an a tf agent and my friend
[2:28:42.200 --> 2:28:44.040]  they went inside the a tf agent
[2:28:44.040 --> 2:28:45.720]  at question me about a couple of
[2:28:45.720 --> 2:28:48.360]  handguns i had purchased years and years before
[2:28:48.360 --> 2:28:51.920]  and i produced record showing that i had traded them into a gun dealer he
[2:28:51.920 --> 2:28:55.000]  indicated they had been used in crime
[2:28:55.000 --> 2:28:57.800]  and then he could start a question he had a stack of paperwork on me asking me
[2:28:57.800 --> 2:29:00.960]  questions about other handguns i had purchased i had recently purchased a
[2:29:00.960 --> 2:29:03.640]  pair of handguns when you purchase two guns at a time
[2:29:03.640 --> 2:29:07.200]  indiana they have to send a multiple purchase form to the government
[2:29:07.200 --> 2:29:10.760]  yet that on hand he wanted to inspect the guns to make sure that's what the
[2:29:10.760 --> 2:29:12.040]  states do is they
[2:29:12.040 --> 2:29:15.520]  they collect the registration data now under the census
[2:29:15.520 --> 2:29:19.280]  uh... back in two thousand it was one in six homes i got one was a forty nine
[2:29:19.280 --> 2:29:20.200]  question
[2:29:20.200 --> 2:29:23.880]  and then i think was one in twenty uh... got a multi-hundred question and it
[2:29:23.880 --> 2:29:25.720]  would ask you do you own firearms
[2:29:25.720 --> 2:29:29.120]  and now obama's announced under the census it's going to be monthly
[2:29:29.120 --> 2:29:32.400]  and they claim under law you gotta answer all the questions when you don't
[2:29:32.400 --> 2:29:35.400]  uh... the constitution says you've got to answer it every
[2:29:35.400 --> 2:29:37.920]  ten years just how many people live there
[2:29:37.920 --> 2:29:41.440]  for apportionment of your state representatives to the legislature

[2:33:35.440 --> 2:33:40.400]  we have a state rep coming on from texas is introduced a bill for sovereignty
[2:33:40.400 --> 2:33:42.400]  next hour for about 20 minutes and we have
[2:33:42.400 --> 2:33:45.680]  it looks like the military is going to be coming on looks like we've got them
[2:33:45.680 --> 2:33:49.120]  coming on so we'll see if that happens i don't want to say more than that
[2:33:49.120 --> 2:33:54.960]  um until we get them on for obvious reasons folks will try to stop them
[2:33:54.960 --> 2:33:58.880]  coming on let me set it uh but who cares whatever
[2:33:58.880 --> 2:34:02.720]  um that is coming up but i want to go to rob freeman
[2:34:02.720 --> 2:34:07.120]  because we were gonna get the fellow on from the seven seven ripple effect who
[2:34:07.120 --> 2:34:11.680]  made the film who mailed it out uh to a bunch of people
[2:34:11.680 --> 2:34:15.840]  and it mailed to a jury you're looking at the seven seven bombings
[2:34:15.840 --> 2:34:18.720]  the saying look you know here's evidence that was an inside job and they arrested
[2:34:18.720 --> 2:34:22.320]  him in ireland uh from and they've got some extradition order now from
[2:34:22.320 --> 2:34:25.920]  england he was supposed to get out today but he uh
[2:34:25.920 --> 2:34:29.280]  anthony hill has not been able to join us so rob freeman good friends with him
[2:34:29.280 --> 2:34:35.760]  what is happening right now a good afternoon alex is nice to be with you
[2:34:35.760 --> 2:34:42.960]  uh as as actually as we speak um anthony john hill has been released
[2:34:42.960 --> 2:34:47.120]  and he was uh allowed uh he was actually ransomed
[2:34:47.120 --> 2:34:54.160]  for the sum of 3,500 euros again this is for sending out a dvd
[2:34:54.160 --> 2:35:02.400]  uh to a judge in in uh england about the trial on the three helpers of the
[2:35:02.400 --> 2:35:06.000]  seven seven london bombings
[2:35:06.160 --> 2:35:10.960]  and for people that aren't aware the uh that particular trial wound up in a
[2:35:10.960 --> 2:35:15.440]  mistrial last year and it's currently being retried so
[2:35:15.440 --> 2:35:19.440]  uh knowing that nothing on this planet happens
[2:35:19.440 --> 2:35:23.280]  uh what for no reason certainly the timing is
[2:35:23.280 --> 2:35:28.160]  is of interest that this particular arrest of anthony john hill would take
[2:35:28.160 --> 2:35:31.600]  place at the same time that this retrial is going on
[2:35:31.600 --> 2:35:34.880]  and now what's happening so so we have double jeopardy
[2:35:34.880 --> 2:35:37.840]  his film shows the mainstream media reports that i remember
[2:35:37.840 --> 2:35:42.080]  that scotland yard was killing some of the Arabs that figured out it was a set
[2:35:42.080 --> 2:35:44.640]  up and this was on the news but then it all was shut down
[2:35:44.640 --> 2:35:49.600]  very powerful film and it backfired now it's in a bunch of british and um
[2:35:49.600 --> 2:35:53.840]  irish and scottish newspapers and and and it's just exploding all over the
[2:35:53.840 --> 2:35:59.840]  web uh go ahead sir yeah the uh you're correct the
[2:35:59.840 --> 2:36:03.280]  the interesting thing is is that the people that were gunned down were
[2:36:03.280 --> 2:36:07.200]  actually the suicide bombers and that's what the film
[2:36:07.200 --> 2:36:10.720]  lets everybody know that it was reported on
[2:36:10.720 --> 2:36:16.480]  mainstream media that they were gunning down uh believe in canary war for
[2:36:16.480 --> 2:36:23.600]  if i don't have the uh place exactly correct the these were the suicide
[2:36:23.600 --> 2:36:28.480]  bombers that were supposedly on the uh trains that they never caught
[2:36:28.480 --> 2:36:34.080]  and they were the ones that were gunned down so you know you you've got
[2:36:34.080 --> 2:36:39.280]  that anomaly but to me one of the more interesting
[2:36:39.280 --> 2:36:44.640]  things is and this fits in with 911 and what you've gone through trying to get
[2:36:44.640 --> 2:36:48.480]  the truth out to to people uh there's some interesting
[2:36:48.480 --> 2:36:51.680]  similarities there that should let everybody know that there is a new
[2:36:51.680 --> 2:36:56.480]  world order it is not isolated to the united states
[2:36:56.480 --> 2:37:03.840]  and uh one of those things is the uh the the mock drills
[2:37:03.840 --> 2:37:09.680]  and you know if you wouldn't mind me uh focusing on that for just a moment
[2:37:09.680 --> 2:37:15.600]  there were mock drills going on on the day of 911 of the exact targets the
[2:37:15.600 --> 2:37:18.960]  exact same place exact same time being attacked
[2:37:18.960 --> 2:37:22.800]  and um yeah we've covered that in terrestorm it's covered even better
[2:37:22.800 --> 2:37:25.200]  uh because you know terrestorm just focuses on that for about 30 minutes
[2:37:25.200 --> 2:37:29.200]  you know in the 77 ripple effect but uh just for time constraints
[2:37:29.200 --> 2:37:32.800]  uh i mean you can get into that if you'd like but i really want to talk about
[2:37:32.800 --> 2:37:37.280]  uh anthony and uh what he's dealing with right now and and and where these
[2:37:37.280 --> 2:37:41.680]  charges are going but go ahead and into the drills briefly
[2:37:41.680 --> 2:37:45.760]  yeah real briefly the uh the same exact
[2:37:45.760 --> 2:37:50.400]  scenario played out in in great britain with the london bombings
[2:37:50.400 --> 2:37:54.640]  there were mock drills going on the same day in the same places
[2:37:54.640 --> 2:37:58.880]  and you know this should be a clear sign to people
[2:37:58.880 --> 2:38:03.120]  what they're dealing with who the real terrorists are so that
[2:38:03.120 --> 2:38:07.280]  everybody can put this in perspective and understand
[2:38:07.280 --> 2:38:11.040]  why these things happen and really the reason that all this is happening to
[2:38:11.040 --> 2:38:15.120]  anthony john hill right now is because he is exposed
[2:38:15.120 --> 2:38:18.720]  well the establishment is now outlawed photographing police in england
[2:38:18.720 --> 2:38:21.920]  but they've got six million cameras in london alone
[2:38:21.920 --> 2:38:24.720]  photographing somebody hundreds of times per day as they walk around this is
[2:38:24.720 --> 2:38:28.320]  blown up in their face though now everybody's watching 77 the ripple
[2:38:28.320 --> 2:38:32.080]  effect well yeah absolutely i mean i mean the most
[2:38:32.080 --> 2:38:35.200]  heavily surveilled people on the planet right now
[2:38:35.200 --> 2:38:40.000]  but you don't photograph police just amazing okay what's happening to anthony
[2:38:40.000 --> 2:38:42.640]  hill where is this going right now last time i heard they want to extra dot him
[2:38:42.640 --> 2:38:48.480]  to england for charges uh he has been grabbed in ireland where is this going
[2:38:48.480 --> 2:38:51.920]  well the charge is perverting the course of justice
[2:38:51.920 --> 2:38:55.920]  and that's for sending this dvd to the judge so that he could know
[2:38:55.920 --> 2:39:00.480]  the truth while the trial was going on this dvd
[2:39:00.480 --> 2:39:04.720]  was of a the in case people don't know the listeners don't know
[2:39:04.720 --> 2:39:11.280]  the 77 ripple effect was released on the 5th of november in 2007
[2:39:11.280 --> 2:39:16.560]  this trial happened in may of 2008 so this dvd that went out
[2:39:16.560 --> 2:39:20.720]  was free information available on the web and it is available on the web for
[2:39:20.720 --> 2:39:25.280]  six months so really nothing you know new there and of
[2:39:25.280 --> 2:39:29.040]  course it's up well people always write letters to watch it they always
[2:39:29.040 --> 2:39:31.360]  write letters and things in big court cases
[2:39:31.360 --> 2:39:35.040]  and and send information to courts i mean this this is asinine
[2:39:35.040 --> 2:39:38.400]  but but when i read the irish times last week they're also going after him
[2:39:38.400 --> 2:39:41.920]  for sending it to a jury right or is that wrong
[2:39:41.920 --> 2:39:45.360]  well the it is reported that he sent it to the jury
[2:39:45.360 --> 2:39:50.160]  foreman and i i have not been able to confirm that with him
[2:39:50.160 --> 2:39:53.600]  okay well okay well here's the big question he said he could be on the
[2:39:53.600 --> 2:39:56.960]  show today we're right when he got out why is he in the answering his phone do
[2:39:56.960 --> 2:40:01.440]  you know how he's doing or has he been told not to talk
[2:40:01.440 --> 2:40:05.360]  well it actually he has and i wanted to discuss that too briefly
[2:40:05.360 --> 2:40:08.480]  there were several conditions to his bail and
[2:40:08.480 --> 2:40:12.800]  i want to give this to you because this is really important to get out
[2:40:12.800 --> 2:40:16.960]  one of the conditions was surrendering his passport
[2:40:16.960 --> 2:40:24.240]  two was he is forbidden to discuss seven seven with anybody in england and wales
[2:40:24.240 --> 2:40:27.600]  okay my god he is so his free speech under the magna
[2:40:27.600 --> 2:40:30.560]  card which has been extended all over europe in the united states that's what
[2:40:30.560 --> 2:40:34.640]  our bill writes is is gone he's not allowed you talk to him this is directly
[2:40:34.640 --> 2:40:39.200]  from him correct he told you he is forbidden
[2:40:39.200 --> 2:40:42.880]  from discussing seven seven in england and wales go ahead
[2:40:42.880 --> 2:40:46.720]  i have spoken directly to him this actually came directly from his
[2:40:46.720 --> 2:40:51.280]  solicitor okay which for people in the united
[2:40:51.280 --> 2:40:54.640]  states that aren't aware a solicitor is a lawyer
[2:40:54.640 --> 2:40:58.240]  so an attorney of baristan this is directly from
[2:40:58.240 --> 2:41:04.000]  yes it's directly from his solicitor and uh he also has a third requirement
[2:41:04.000 --> 2:41:07.680]  that he has to sign in three times at a at a
[2:41:07.680 --> 2:41:11.360]  guard station which is the irish police and they're
[2:41:11.360 --> 2:41:14.880]  going ahead with with the charges against him
[2:41:14.880 --> 2:41:18.800]  okay and that's the other interesting thing he has actually only been held on
[2:41:18.800 --> 2:41:24.560]  an e u arrest warrant that's it under any problems no british
[2:41:24.560 --> 2:41:28.720]  yes there's been no british warrant produced and there has been no search
[2:41:28.720 --> 2:41:33.360]  warrant produced for the things that they confiscated from him
[2:41:33.360 --> 2:41:37.360]  well they're complete morons because this film was already very popular and
[2:41:37.360 --> 2:41:41.040]  i've talked about on air how great it was and now it's going supernova
[2:41:41.040 --> 2:41:44.080]  so everybody go get seven seven ripple effect on the web they're trying to take
[2:41:44.080 --> 2:41:47.680]  it down a lot of sites they're very upset by this because it proves
[2:41:47.680 --> 2:41:52.560]  exactly what they did and that's why they want to shut the web down
[2:41:52.560 --> 2:41:56.720]  well and not only that but you know it for people that don't know
[2:41:56.720 --> 2:42:00.960]  much about him this is the same man who spent the last
[2:42:00.960 --> 2:42:04.320]  10 years trying to raise the arc of the covenant
[2:42:04.320 --> 2:42:08.560]  in ireland and knows the exact location of the
[2:42:08.560 --> 2:42:15.280]  entrance to the subterranean mergue that uh down to a six foot by six foot
[2:42:15.280 --> 2:42:18.960]  square of grass and they're not about to let him dig it
[2:42:18.960 --> 2:42:22.960]  because they know that it's there and they know that he would be the one to
[2:42:22.960 --> 2:42:26.720]  bring it up well the british lords do and then the queen and all them do claim
[2:42:26.720 --> 2:42:29.520]  that they have that i don't know if that's true but i know he's also done a
[2:42:29.520 --> 2:42:32.880]  lot of research on that very very interesting one we want to get him on
[2:42:32.880 --> 2:42:35.600]  i guess talk about that i guess he can't now talk
[2:42:35.600 --> 2:42:41.040]  oh we're gonna let you go are we busy since actually he could come on to talk
[2:42:41.040 --> 2:42:45.840]  about that i would think and i would love uh to see if we could schedule
[2:42:45.840 --> 2:42:49.440]  something like that for you because i think you're uh
[2:42:49.440 --> 2:42:53.920]  it this all has a tie into the new world order and it is a solution
[2:42:53.920 --> 2:42:57.280]  you know he's been he's been a prolific researcher and been very effective in
[2:42:57.280 --> 2:43:00.240]  his film seven seven ripple effect is just amazing i don't know the man but
[2:43:00.240 --> 2:43:03.440]  we'll talk to him then next week as this develops thank you so much for joining
[2:43:03.440 --> 2:43:07.040]  us sir thank you alex i hope you have a good day
[2:43:07.040 --> 2:43:10.000]  you bet is there a particular website uh where we can look at more of his
[2:43:10.000 --> 2:43:13.040]  material because i guess if he's barred from talking about it though i guess
[2:43:13.040 --> 2:43:16.880]  they're gonna make him take that down no i don't think so and i'd like to give
[2:43:16.880 --> 2:43:20.800]  that out if you wouldn't mind please we need to mirror the site
[2:43:20.800 --> 2:43:27.680]  okay it is h t t p colon backslash backslash
[2:43:27.680 --> 2:43:34.320]  jaw truth dot net and that's j a h t r u t h
[2:43:34.320 --> 2:43:39.360]  dot net all right thank you sir our men down under we're gonna go to call from
[2:43:39.360 --> 2:43:42.400]  australia here just a moment before they hang up because i want to skip ahead to
[2:43:42.400 --> 2:43:45.280]  them and go back to other folks that are calling in uh your take on
[2:43:45.280 --> 2:43:49.360]  uh hearing about uh them putting a gag order on uh mr hill from being able to
[2:43:49.360 --> 2:43:53.920]  come on this show well similar things has happened in australia with australian
[2:43:53.920 --> 2:43:57.440]  uh detainees in guantanamo bay they've come back to australia and they've had
[2:43:57.440 --> 2:44:00.480]  gag orders on them and we really haven't heard their full stories they call that
[2:44:00.480 --> 2:44:03.280]  a d notice in england they just tell the media shut up to
[2:44:03.280 --> 2:44:07.200]  it's actually quite common yeah there's nothing unusual about some things like
[2:44:07.200 --> 2:44:10.320]  that in australia in fact i don't think you would hear much
[2:44:10.320 --> 2:44:12.800]  discussion about i think it's considered just one of those things that
[2:44:12.800 --> 2:44:16.160]  happens as part of the case the truth is these countries aren't free now and the
[2:44:16.160 --> 2:44:19.600]  united states is becoming unfree as well
[2:44:19.600 --> 2:44:23.040]  absolutely i mean we're just not sure where to go from here alex i mean um
[2:44:23.040 --> 2:44:25.840]  you know bringing up children you just want to know what to tell them and what
[2:44:25.840 --> 2:44:29.920]  to believe and it's really hard in a climate such as this way if you
[2:44:29.920 --> 2:44:33.280]  believe there's a tyranny coming or that there's tyranny here
[2:44:33.280 --> 2:44:36.160]  what do you do what what you believe where should you look for for truth and
[2:44:36.160 --> 2:44:39.680]  that's a lot of the big questions and what do we tell our kids that's what i
[2:44:39.680 --> 2:44:43.040]  wake up and think about every day our big frustration is we go around as part of
[2:44:43.040 --> 2:44:46.160]  our tv show we go around and talk to people on the street and by and large
[2:44:46.160 --> 2:44:48.560]  you tell them things exactly what you just described
[2:44:48.560 --> 2:44:51.840]  you know hey listen people are not able to talk freely about the things that
[2:44:51.840 --> 2:44:55.600]  they're experiencing well what i hear more than anything is well we're at
[2:44:55.600 --> 2:44:58.640]  war we need to wait and see what the government's going to do
[2:44:58.640 --> 2:45:01.760]  we need to wait and see what's going to happen it's very unprotection it's for
[2:45:01.760 --> 2:45:05.120]  own protection things like this i don't actually see a lot of resistance
[2:45:05.120 --> 2:45:13.600]  yeah well it's mounting here uh... let's go to jake in australia welcome sir
[2:45:13.600 --> 2:45:17.840]  yeah i don't know if you're on the air welcome
[2:45:17.840 --> 2:45:22.160]  welcome uh... yeah man i i guess uh...
[2:45:22.160 --> 2:45:26.960]  to cut it short i should maybe submit some factual evidence about the
[2:45:26.960 --> 2:45:31.680]  situation in australia with people waking up to 9-11 truth
[2:45:31.680 --> 2:45:36.080]  i think there was a lot of people in january 2006
[2:45:36.080 --> 2:45:42.880]  when it seems like some dissident executive at channel 10 on one of their
[2:45:42.880 --> 2:45:48.320]  freedom and mainstream networks broadcast 9-11 in plain sight
[2:45:48.320 --> 2:45:53.200]  and i wouldn't uh... you know recommend it as a breakthrough in these days
[2:45:53.200 --> 2:45:57.360]  because there's been a lot of like counter attack and establishment
[2:45:57.360 --> 2:46:01.120]  hearing is from the opposition but at the time
[2:46:01.120 --> 2:46:04.960]  for many Australians they actually saw footage of 9-11 that
[2:46:04.960 --> 2:46:11.040]  in five years incredulously they had never witnessed in their life
[2:46:11.040 --> 2:46:15.520]  and yet 9-11 was covered so much in australia
[2:46:15.520 --> 2:46:18.400]  that it was impossible and i'm sure you film crew there
[2:46:18.400 --> 2:46:22.560]  witnessed this too that it was impossible to witness
[2:46:22.560 --> 2:46:27.200]  uh... any radio station news broadcast in the country on any given day without
[2:46:27.200 --> 2:46:31.600]  some mention of the threat of terrorism and 9-11
[2:46:31.600 --> 2:46:35.360]  and yet and the television were over-broadcasting and repeating
[2:46:35.360 --> 2:46:38.400]  all the footage that they claimed it was the total
[2:46:38.400 --> 2:46:45.040]  um uh uh uh canon of footage and yet oh my god it's amazing
[2:46:45.040 --> 2:46:49.040]  so it was if you've been paying attention it was
[2:46:49.040 --> 2:46:53.440]  obvious they had been blanking out you know stuff like
[2:46:53.440 --> 2:46:58.000]  live journalists in new york with bust all over them
[2:46:58.000 --> 2:47:01.920]  talking about you know witnessing all these explosions everything that for me
[2:47:01.920 --> 2:47:07.520]  so i wake up in january 2006 but to say something in defense of a
[2:47:07.520 --> 2:47:10.400]  silence and and maybe you film crew that can
[2:47:10.400 --> 2:47:15.760]  can speak of this uh you know uh the only kind of mainstream media where
[2:47:15.760 --> 2:47:19.360]  they actually attempted to confront us
[2:47:19.360 --> 2:47:26.000]  was in about uh april 2006 on the australian broadcasting
[2:47:26.000 --> 2:47:30.240]  corporation on a radio show hosted by adams
[2:47:30.240 --> 2:47:34.400]  where he speaks with what he calls his washington insider
[2:47:34.400 --> 2:47:41.200]  bruce Shapiro and mockingly uh tell all of his listeners that they are
[2:47:41.200 --> 2:47:45.840]  mistaken about 9-11 uh okay okay i appreciate your call
[2:47:45.840 --> 2:47:49.760]  yeah you have australian one of the tightest from what i've
[2:47:49.760 --> 2:47:53.280]  read bubbles of information now that the australians are using the web and
[2:47:53.280 --> 2:47:56.320]  waking up they're moving saying we're gonna have chinese style
[2:47:56.320 --> 2:47:58.640]  censorship you won't visit any alternative sites
[2:47:58.640 --> 2:48:02.080]  this is being announced they're doing it they're quote testing it
[2:48:02.080 --> 2:48:05.440]  uh they're their hubs right now the chinese fight to get around them i guess
[2:48:05.440 --> 2:48:07.520]  the ossees most of them are like oh that's fine
[2:48:07.520 --> 2:48:11.200]  they're keeping us safe uh but i'm not trying to be mean that's i mean that's
[2:48:11.200 --> 2:48:15.200]  how you describe it well we're cranky we kind of be allowed to read the other
[2:48:15.200 --> 2:48:18.800]  than that how kind of might get us i'm sorry
[2:48:18.800 --> 2:48:22.240]  well you should know alex the Australians really don't like americans
[2:48:22.240 --> 2:48:25.440]  uh imitating them but uh but they get it done a lot
[2:48:25.440 --> 2:48:28.720]  i think hey hey hey we did the british yesterday you did very well yesterday i
[2:48:28.720 --> 2:48:32.640]  have to well we like that we don't like the british hey well we like them or
[2:48:32.640 --> 2:48:36.560]  i mean but the world a lot of people are from there but the point is
[2:48:36.560 --> 2:48:40.560]  go ahead and do an american imitation then make it better ours
[2:48:40.560 --> 2:48:45.040]  ours well i alex we're in texas and we just really really appreciate being on

[2:48:58.960 --> 2:49:03.440]  oh my god it's fun
[2:49:03.440 --> 2:49:08.000]  it's fun i mean on on on jakey called in i mean the big thing is that i think it
[2:49:08.000 --> 2:49:11.040]  was it was fascinating that in plain sight played on national television in
[2:49:11.040 --> 2:49:14.000]  australia that was a long time ago but the big
[2:49:14.000 --> 2:49:18.000]  discussion now is that i mean the bbc piece about 9 11
[2:49:18.000 --> 2:49:22.480]  had a couple of months ago and now that seems to have really polarized people's
[2:49:22.480 --> 2:49:26.240]  um ideas on 9 11 they they want attacking me or the other one
[2:49:26.240 --> 2:49:28.960]  other one attacking your dylan avery in particular
[2:49:28.960 --> 2:49:32.800]  um and i don't want their favorite person in here yeah and i mean i remember
[2:49:32.800 --> 2:49:36.320]  seeing it i was talking to a teenage girl the next day and she said
[2:49:36.320 --> 2:49:40.160]  that guy meaning dylan avery was such a you know bleep bleep bleep
[2:49:40.160 --> 2:49:44.320]  and i said but do you see any bias in that piece whatsoever she said no that

[2:50:04.720 --> 2:50:09.440]  which is why films like in plain sight actually get screened because you know
[2:50:09.440 --> 2:50:13.120]  that stuff is still possible but you know about internet censoring because you
[2:50:13.120 --> 2:50:17.680]  brought that up just a second ago just before uh... the new prime minister
[2:50:17.680 --> 2:50:20.240]  made an announcement that that would be something we would talk about
[2:50:20.240 --> 2:50:24.560]  60 minutes ran a segment about child pornography and and and different
[2:50:24.560 --> 2:50:27.520]  types of pornography on the web as one of a number of current affairs stories

[2:54:53.120 --> 2:54:58.560]  go ahead don't know you go ahead okay um i think that uh an organized protest
[2:54:58.560 --> 2:55:01.120]  would be a lot better than just a bunch of individuals going up

[3:00:18.240 --> 3:00:21.760]  states have introduced declaratory statements reaffirming their tenth
[3:00:21.760 --> 3:00:25.280]  amendment rights other states are on the verge of passing or have passed
[3:00:25.280 --> 3:00:29.280]  tenth amendment bills saying no gun confiscation no martial law
[3:00:29.280 --> 3:00:32.320]  we had a state representative on who's introduced one in montana that's already
[3:00:32.320 --> 3:00:36.480]  done two readings has a good chance of passing right now in their session
[3:00:36.480 --> 3:00:41.120]  but folks want a statement in texas about sovereignty
[3:00:41.120 --> 3:00:44.640]  and that has indeed happened and during this week it got written up by
[3:00:44.640 --> 3:00:50.640]  representative leo burman representative six legislative district
[3:00:50.640 --> 3:00:53.280]  smith county right here in the great state of texas

[3:00:57.600 --> 3:01:01.200]  50 but to go over that where this is the man that pinned the bill and has now
[3:01:01.200 --> 3:01:05.360]  introduced it representative leo burman sir thank you for coming on with us
[3:01:05.360 --> 3:01:09.120]  alex it's a pleasure to be with you and actually next week i'm going to file
[3:01:09.120 --> 3:01:13.680]  another resolution and that resolution will do the same thing however it's
[3:01:13.680 --> 3:01:16.720]  going to cover both the ninth and the tenth amendments
[3:01:16.720 --> 3:01:21.840]  to the u.s constitution and what we have there now hcr 50 just talks about
[3:01:21.840 --> 3:01:26.160]  our rights under the tenth amendment what we're doing is reaffirming our
[3:01:26.160 --> 3:01:29.680]  sovereignty we're telling washington that if you're
[3:01:29.680 --> 3:01:33.040]  going to mandate anything on the state of texas
[3:01:33.040 --> 3:01:36.880]  if it's not fully contained in the u.s constitution
[3:01:36.880 --> 3:01:41.040]  we're not going to do it and the reason we're doing this we're taking action is
[3:01:41.040 --> 3:01:46.160]  because of the we understand it's going to be a federal handgun registration
[3:01:46.160 --> 3:01:50.240]  we don't want him to know where all of our guns are here in texas
[3:01:50.240 --> 3:01:54.320]  and also there's another bill federal hate crimes bill
[3:01:54.320 --> 3:01:57.920]  if you open up your old testament to the bible and read in the book of exodus
[3:01:57.920 --> 3:02:02.800]  that homosexuality is an abomination you could be charged with a crime under
[3:02:02.800 --> 3:02:06.800]  that bill and that's exactly what's happening in canada right now
[3:02:06.800 --> 3:02:09.680]  so we're just saying if it's not in the constitution
[3:02:09.680 --> 3:02:14.960]  don't tell us about it don't ask us to do it because we're not going to do it
[3:02:14.960 --> 3:02:18.720]  why are resolutions needed like this but not just resolutions the state
[3:02:18.720 --> 3:02:22.480]  acting on these resolutions i mean it you know the unfunded mandates federal
[3:02:22.480 --> 3:02:26.480]  gun restriction laws uh... north com announcing that they're going to be over
[3:02:26.480 --> 3:02:30.000]  the states overstate governors i mean we haven't seen this is the civil war
[3:02:30.000 --> 3:02:33.520]  well you're absolutely right and you just answered the question yourself alex
[3:02:33.520 --> 3:02:36.400]  they're running all over us and they can't do that
[3:02:36.400 --> 3:02:40.080]  we're going to reassert our rights under the ninth and tenth amendments and let
[3:02:40.080 --> 3:02:44.880]  mr obama know we don't want socialism in texas
[3:02:44.880 --> 3:02:48.480]  we don't want socialism anywhere in the united states
[3:02:48.480 --> 3:02:51.760]  and if you're going to push us we're going to push back period
[3:02:51.760 --> 3:02:55.120]  well for those that don't know uh... bloomberg reports nine point seven
[3:02:55.120 --> 3:02:57.200]  trillion taken out eight hundred and forty billion
[3:02:57.200 --> 3:03:00.720]  and now to the stimulus package it's basically total federalization
[3:03:00.720 --> 3:03:04.480]  uh... just all sorts of databases in federal control
[3:03:04.480 --> 3:03:08.480]  and uh... they're talking about now taking taxpayer money and giving
[3:03:08.480 --> 3:03:11.840]  hundreds of billions of dollars of it the corporations and private groups
[3:03:11.840 --> 3:03:14.560]  individuals i mean this is robbery this is bank robbery
[3:03:14.560 --> 3:03:18.400]  it's absolute robbery but obama said he's going to redistribute wealth and this
[3:03:18.400 --> 3:03:20.880]  is his way of redistributing wealth and
[3:03:20.880 --> 3:03:24.880]  before i got back up to my office this afternoon i was listening to talk radio
[3:03:24.880 --> 3:03:29.280]  in my car and rush was telling about much of this money
[3:03:29.280 --> 3:03:34.400]  going to help pay people's rent their deposit on an apartment
[3:03:34.400 --> 3:03:39.840]  it's unbelievable but this is a direct transfer of money from our kids
[3:03:39.840 --> 3:03:44.240]  and our grandkids in the future to people now
[3:03:44.240 --> 3:03:47.920]  and it's wrong and it needs to stop well notice what's happened
[3:03:47.920 --> 3:03:51.840]  these foreign banks have bankrupted the u.s. with their derivatives and and
[3:03:51.840 --> 3:03:55.440]  all this garbage they get the bailout money in october and day one say we're
[3:03:55.440 --> 3:04:00.080]  not using it to unfree the mortgages now and it's also going to
[3:04:00.080 --> 3:04:04.640]  inflate uh... the money supply and the value people savings i mean
[3:04:04.640 --> 3:04:08.880]  this is only going to make it worse i think it's going to make it a lot worse
[3:04:08.880 --> 3:04:11.920]  than uh... alex and i'm very much ashamed that uh...
[3:04:11.920 --> 3:04:14.800]  the first money came out of the bush administration
[3:04:14.800 --> 3:04:19.520]  you know i hate that he should not have done anything at that time
[3:04:19.520 --> 3:04:23.840]  the market would have corrected itself i still believe the market will correct
[3:04:23.840 --> 3:04:28.160]  self it's done so for over two hundred and thirty one years as long as we've
[3:04:28.160 --> 3:04:32.320]  been in the nation but to spend that kind of money it
[3:04:32.320 --> 3:04:37.440]  is ridiculous you can take up uh... fifty thousand to a hundred thousand
[3:04:37.440 --> 3:04:40.720]  dollars out of that two trillion dollar uh...
[3:04:40.720 --> 3:04:45.200]  bailout and give it to every single family in the united states
[3:04:45.200 --> 3:04:47.840]  they would buy a new car they would pay off their home
[3:04:47.840 --> 3:04:51.360]  that would do better than what he's doing right now because this isn't even
[3:04:51.360 --> 3:04:54.400]  pure socialism it's it's government bureaucracy taking over getting us
[3:04:54.400 --> 3:04:57.680]  dependent stay there i want to get into what the states are going to do to
[3:04:57.680 --> 3:05:01.920]  resist this
[3:05:01.920 --> 3:05:06.720]  today unlike any other in the long course of american history a terrorist act of
[3:05:06.720 --> 3:05:11.360]  war against this country the enemy struck america on september 11th

[3:05:29.200 --> 3:05:34.400]  in spying in and on the u.s i'm aware that uh... some israeli citizens

[3:07:09.440 --> 3:07:12.320]  when drinking the water that's because many chemicals are
[3:07:12.320 --> 3:07:15.680]  inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin

[3:08:12.960 --> 3:08:17.280]  he is with the six legislative district of
[3:08:17.280 --> 3:08:22.160]  smith county here in texas representative leo berman
[3:08:22.160 --> 3:08:27.680]  has introduced hcr 50 under tenth amendment telling the feds back off
[3:08:27.680 --> 3:08:31.040]  he's introducing a larger ninth and tenth amendment
[3:08:31.040 --> 3:08:34.560]  bill next week tell us a difference between these two bills and why you're
[3:08:34.560 --> 3:08:39.920]  doing it is two parts and then as we see 29 states
[3:08:39.920 --> 3:08:42.640]  28 states i believe this is 29th about to declare
[3:08:42.640 --> 3:08:47.200]  some of them are are even passing it saying no to the system in the early
[3:08:47.200 --> 3:08:50.640]  90s 14 states pass these colorado
[3:08:50.640 --> 3:08:54.000]  california and others they're not talking about enforcing them
[3:08:54.000 --> 3:08:57.600]  as things collapse as the feds take our money send a lot of it to foreign
[3:08:57.600 --> 3:08:59.840]  offshore banks as the new york times admits they're doing
[3:08:59.840 --> 3:09:03.040]  they're buying up insurance corporations other healthy banks
[3:09:03.040 --> 3:09:07.520]  this vertical integration uh... time magazine had a headline last week the
[3:09:07.520 --> 3:09:10.960]  new world order said a new bank of the world
[3:09:10.960 --> 3:09:14.080]  will regulate control the u.s we'll pay carbon taxes to them
[3:09:14.080 --> 3:09:18.240]  so when you speak to the two bills and where you see this going as the feds
[3:09:18.240 --> 3:09:23.360]  basically try to federalize the states and uh...
[3:09:23.360 --> 3:09:28.480]  what you think's going to happen sir well let me answer your first question
[3:09:28.480 --> 3:09:32.560]  first the uh... you asked me about what i'm going to file next week next week
[3:09:32.560 --> 3:09:35.840]  well we're going to file a resolution which includes the ninth and the tenth
[3:09:35.840 --> 3:09:39.440]  amendment the tenth amendment reassert states rights
[3:09:39.440 --> 3:09:44.800]  the ninth amendment says that any uh... any issue which is not which is
[3:09:44.800 --> 3:09:47.840]  enumerated in the united states constitution
[3:09:47.840 --> 3:09:51.120]  does not preclude a state from doing the same
[3:09:51.120 --> 3:09:54.320]  and that's what the ninth amendment is so for example
[3:09:54.320 --> 3:09:58.880]  since the uh... the u.s government federal government is not dealing at all
[3:09:58.880 --> 3:10:03.440]  on illegal aliens we're going to try and deal with two million illegal aliens
[3:10:03.440 --> 3:10:08.000]  right here in texas in fact i filed thirteen bills to deal with illegal
[3:10:08.000 --> 3:10:12.960]  aliens we've had the baits they're costing us four billion dollars a year
[3:10:12.960 --> 3:10:17.760]  in texas and across the united states i believe the number i saw was three
[3:10:17.760 --> 3:10:20.800]  hundred and thirty eight billion dollars a year
[3:10:20.800 --> 3:10:25.680]  which is more than what we're spending in uh... in iraq if we gave one fourth
[3:10:25.680 --> 3:10:29.760]  of that four billion of the state police and commanded them
[3:10:29.760 --> 3:10:32.880]  which are so federalized to go protect the border
[3:10:32.880 --> 3:10:35.440]  they could protect that border and secure it could they and we couldn't have
[3:10:35.440 --> 3:10:38.960]  billion dollars put thousands of state police on the border
[3:10:38.960 --> 3:10:42.640]  absolutely without question and alex and you bring that up i'm going to bring
[3:10:42.640 --> 3:10:47.600]  up something else here if we can't deal with illegal aliens in texas during
[3:10:47.600 --> 3:10:52.240]  this legislative session i intend to announce my candidacy for governor of
[3:10:52.240 --> 3:10:55.360]  texas and use the executive power of the office of
[3:10:55.360 --> 3:11:00.960]  governor to do exactly as you just suggested to deal with illegal aliens
[3:11:00.960 --> 3:11:05.920]  we have a lot of people in in in texas who don't want to touch them i'm talking
[3:11:05.920 --> 3:11:08.720]  about statewide republican leaders or
[3:11:08.720 --> 3:11:13.120]  or statewide national leaders who have their heads buried in the sand
[3:11:13.120 --> 3:11:17.440]  and when i asked them why they won't deal their answer is they don't want to lose
[3:11:17.440 --> 3:11:22.320]  the hispanic vote and i asked them what about your oath of office where you say
[3:11:22.320 --> 3:11:26.000]  you can preserve protecting defend the constitution and laws
[3:11:26.000 --> 3:11:30.000]  of the united states in the state of texas and what about doing what's right
[3:11:30.000 --> 3:11:34.080]  instead of looking toward a hispanic vote to get you reelected
[3:11:34.080 --> 3:11:37.760]  but mister bernard ten erupting i want you to continue this is
[3:11:37.760 --> 3:11:42.000]  very important information i've seen the gallop polls
[3:11:42.000 --> 3:11:45.680]  upwards of eighty percent of hispanic americans want to control the borders as
[3:11:45.680 --> 3:11:49.360]  well they know that a hundred million people down south with that country
[3:11:49.360 --> 3:11:53.680]  admittedly el paso times and homeland security saying on the verge
[3:11:53.680 --> 3:11:59.440]  us today by the way collapsing we've got to do something i mean do we want to
[3:11:59.440 --> 3:12:03.760]  have one dollar an hour wages do we want this to bankrupt all the cities and
[3:12:03.760 --> 3:12:06.480]  counties have to pay for all the health care in the anchor babies
[3:12:06.480 --> 3:12:10.640]  i mean so that's another fraud the media acts like all hispanics learn open
[3:12:10.640 --> 3:12:14.480]  border and make it some racial issue when it's an issue of a third world
[3:12:14.480 --> 3:12:18.320]  narco terrorist state to our south collapsing go ahead
[3:12:18.320 --> 3:12:21.600]  alex you hit the nail right on the handle let me tell you the second biggest
[3:12:21.600 --> 3:12:27.200]  opponent to dealing with illegal aliens the business community in texas
[3:12:27.200 --> 3:12:31.440]  is an organization called the texas association of business which is our
[3:12:31.440 --> 3:12:34.560]  statewide chamber of commerce organization
[3:12:34.560 --> 3:12:38.560]  and they want this large pool of cheap labor
[3:12:38.560 --> 3:12:43.040]  but the people would just raise their wages up about eight percent
[3:12:43.040 --> 3:12:46.800]  with our six percent unemployment rate in texas
[3:12:46.800 --> 3:12:52.720]  americans will start taking all those jobs that illegal aliens hold right now
[3:12:52.720 --> 3:12:56.000]  we've got to deal with them because we also have twenty five
[3:12:56.000 --> 3:12:59.600]  thousand illegal aliens in our state prison
[3:12:59.600 --> 3:13:03.840]  and our county jails that have cost the forty million dollars a year
[3:13:03.840 --> 3:13:09.680]  we're treating them for multi drug resistant tb polio the plague leprosy
[3:13:09.680 --> 3:13:14.800]  malaria shaga's disease it's costing us a fortune
[3:13:14.800 --> 3:13:19.680]  it's bankrupting our hospitals we have chaos in our emergency rooms
[3:13:19.680 --> 3:13:24.160]  yet we have legislators and higher up legislators
[3:13:24.160 --> 3:13:29.520]  who don't want to touch illegal aliens i do and we have some 35 bills that have
[3:13:29.520 --> 3:13:34.240]  been filed so far in texas to deal with illegal aliens in texas
[3:13:34.240 --> 3:13:37.600]  and while we're talking about that the stimulus package
[3:13:37.600 --> 3:13:41.280]  somewhere in the stimulus package it also maintains
[3:13:41.280 --> 3:13:46.880]  jobs for illegal aliens at the expense of u.s citizens
[3:13:46.880 --> 3:13:50.080]  well i'm looking at your record here u.s army field
[3:13:50.080 --> 3:13:53.760]  artillery officer candidate school hall of fame all the great work you've done
[3:13:53.760 --> 3:13:57.680]  for the second amendment uh... which committees are you want how do we
[3:13:57.680 --> 3:14:01.120]  support these bills how do texas get behind this
[3:14:01.120 --> 3:14:05.440]  well the first one i'm going to talk about it is that hcr 50 which reasserts
[3:14:05.440 --> 3:14:09.200]  our state's rights uh... anybody in texas can contact
[3:14:09.200 --> 3:14:12.080]  their own state representative and senators
[3:14:12.080 --> 3:14:15.920]  and ask them to support hcr which means
[3:14:15.920 --> 3:14:21.680]  house concurrent resolution number 50 when the bill is concerning illegal
[3:14:21.680 --> 3:14:26.640]  aliens start being heard uh... you'll see that in every newspaper in the
[3:14:26.640 --> 3:14:29.600]  state and people can come in and testify
[3:14:29.600 --> 3:14:32.960]  they can call their representatives again and senators
[3:14:32.960 --> 3:14:36.880]  to ask them to support these bills we don't want
[3:14:36.880 --> 3:14:41.360]  to continue to spend four billion dollars a year on illegal aliens and by
[3:14:41.360 --> 3:14:44.960]  the way that's a conservative number i've seen houston chronicle articles
[3:14:44.960 --> 3:14:49.280]  with the headline two hundred thousand illegals released from houston jails
[3:14:49.280 --> 3:14:54.720]  in one year i mean i have had i've pulled up my parking lot at my office
[3:14:54.720 --> 3:14:58.320]  one of my guys had expired driver's license and the police were saying we
[3:14:58.320 --> 3:15:01.040]  now take you to jail for this and i walked up
[3:15:01.040 --> 3:15:04.800]  and i said and the police all knew me and i happened from
[3:15:04.800 --> 3:15:09.120]  local tv show i said i said if he was a legal alien you wouldn't take him to
[3:15:09.120 --> 3:15:11.840]  jail and they said yeah that's right we kind of get in trouble for that
[3:15:11.840 --> 3:15:15.760]  because the judges just let him go the illegal aliens are above the american
[3:15:15.760 --> 3:15:19.520]  people they don't have to follow any law welfare fraud it goes on and on
[3:15:19.520 --> 3:15:23.680]  it's amazing and i had middle income constituents and so do other reps in
[3:15:23.680 --> 3:15:26.720]  this state middle income constituents who have less
[3:15:26.720 --> 3:15:30.000]  health benefits than an illegal alien does
[3:15:30.000 --> 3:15:33.760]  they make a little bit too much money to be on Medicaid which is a state
[3:15:33.760 --> 3:15:38.240]  welfare medical program they don't make enough money to buy their own health
[3:15:38.240 --> 3:15:41.440]  insurance but they can't go into a hospital and
[3:15:41.440 --> 3:15:44.880]  demand free health care now let me tell you what that does
[3:15:44.880 --> 3:15:51.120]  at parkland hospital in dallas texas 70 percent of the new birds
[3:15:51.120 --> 3:15:55.920]  are of illegal aliens at john peter smith hospital the public hospital in
[3:15:55.920 --> 3:16:00.800]  sport worth 75 percent of the new birds are a illegal alien
[3:16:00.800 --> 3:16:05.360]  we're paying them to keep putting out one baby a year and these women keep
[3:16:05.360 --> 3:16:08.800]  going back in the hospital they keep getting uh
[3:16:08.800 --> 3:16:12.960]  prenatal care they get birth to a child then they get all the welfare
[3:16:12.960 --> 3:16:16.800]  then then then with the curricula cards and then banks give them bank ids and
[3:16:16.800 --> 3:16:20.640]  they get other ids and they get i've seen cases where one woman's on like
[3:16:20.640 --> 3:16:24.800]  eight or nine different types of welfare but alex the worst thing of all
[3:16:24.800 --> 3:16:28.320]  when they leave that hospital we give their children
[3:16:28.320 --> 3:16:32.320]  citizenship of the united states our most precious benefit
[3:16:32.320 --> 3:16:36.000]  we're giving away to people who who are committing a crime against the united
[3:16:36.000 --> 3:16:39.680]  states and i'm challenging automatic citizenship
[3:16:39.680 --> 3:16:43.200]  under the fourteenth amendment as well well mr barman i'm going to support you
[3:16:43.200 --> 3:16:46.800]  for governor because k belly hutrickson is for open borders
[3:16:46.800 --> 3:16:50.800]  and uh rick perry well what do you say about him
[3:16:50.800 --> 3:16:56.640]  um he's one of those who told me that he doesn't want to lose the hispanic vote
[3:16:56.640 --> 3:16:59.120]  but eighty percent i've seen the gallop polls
[3:16:59.120 --> 3:17:04.880]  uh hispanics i mean know that this is killing america killing their future
[3:17:04.880 --> 3:17:07.360]  killing their wages i mean it's bankrupting the states
[3:17:07.360 --> 3:17:10.240]  and the feds love it because they can come in and federalize
[3:17:10.240 --> 3:17:14.160]  you wouldn't know it from the 32 hispanic representatives who serve in the
[3:17:14.160 --> 3:17:18.640]  texas house the representatives they want to give more benefits to illegal
[3:17:18.640 --> 3:17:21.360]  aliens while we're trying to take them away
[3:17:21.360 --> 3:17:25.840]  we complained to to the uh banking commissioner early last year
[3:17:25.840 --> 3:17:30.400]  when we start seeing signs outside the bank saying we accept the matricula
[3:17:30.400 --> 3:17:34.400]  consular the phonious identification document i've
[3:17:34.400 --> 3:17:37.920]  ever seen in the world yeah we had the republican head
[3:17:37.920 --> 3:17:40.960]  of the state house in colorado on a few years ago himself
[3:17:40.960 --> 3:17:44.880]  went out in one day got four fake matriculas for himself
[3:17:44.880 --> 3:17:50.720]  oh wow amazing i don't doubt it it's a bad situation alex
[3:17:50.720 --> 3:17:54.560]  well it's hcr 50 do you know what the number is going to be on the next bill
[3:17:54.560 --> 3:17:58.160]  no i won't know it until we actually file the bill but uh

[3:18:11.120 --> 3:18:13.520]  the state representatives or is there a key committee
[3:18:13.520 --> 3:18:16.640]  to call to put pressure on them to bring this out of committee
[3:18:16.640 --> 3:18:20.320]  well those uh those are resolutions and they'll be going to the house
[3:18:20.320 --> 3:18:24.160]  resolutions committee that's the first step we'd have to call the house
[3:18:24.160 --> 3:18:27.200]  resolutions committee and make sure it gets out of committee
[3:18:27.200 --> 3:18:31.440]  and then once it gets to the house floor then we have to start calling every
[3:18:31.440 --> 3:18:34.400]  representative to make sure they understand that they should be
[3:18:34.400 --> 3:18:38.080]  supporting hcr 50 well to tell folks how this works

[3:33:50.480 --> 3:33:53.520]  and lieutenant colonel i really appreciate you coming on on such short
[3:33:53.520 --> 3:33:56.640]  notice sir my pleasure thanks for the invitation
[3:33:56.640 --> 3:34:02.080]  you bet i saw this article out of the daily times harold in carol iowa have
[3:34:02.080 --> 3:34:06.960]  you seen that i sure have uh and it's it's it's it's
[3:34:06.960 --> 3:34:11.280]  telling us about an urban warfare drill to be held in several towns can you
[3:34:11.280 --> 3:34:16.400]  tell us about that sure it's actually a plan training event
[3:34:16.400 --> 3:34:20.800]  to provide our soldiers with greater proficiency at what we call
[3:34:20.800 --> 3:34:24.640]  cordon and search which is a mission that um
[3:34:24.640 --> 3:34:28.720]  just for a little background we've deployed nearly 13 000 members of the
[3:34:28.720 --> 3:34:31.680]  iowa national guard in the global war on terror
[3:34:31.680 --> 3:34:35.840]  and the vast majority of those have been in iraq and afghanistan
[3:34:35.840 --> 3:34:39.680]  and one of the missions that they perform in iraq and afghanistan on multiple
[3:34:39.680 --> 3:34:43.760]  occasions is cordon and search we're basically you're trying to get to an
[3:34:43.760 --> 3:34:46.640]  area uh coordinate off to make sure everything's
[3:34:46.640 --> 3:34:50.800]  safe and then actually search for caches of weapons or other kinds of
[3:34:50.800 --> 3:34:55.200]  contraband which could harm um american forces another like feluja
[3:34:55.200 --> 3:34:59.760]  what we saw in frugia correct exactly so
[3:34:59.760 --> 3:35:03.360]  because of where we're located in iowa there are no active duty bases
[3:35:03.360 --> 3:35:06.960]  in iowa so we kind of have to create our own urban training
[3:35:06.960 --> 3:35:11.120]  environments uh so that the plan on this particular training event was to
[3:35:11.120 --> 3:35:14.640]  actually use a small town of about 450 people
[3:35:14.640 --> 3:35:18.560]  uh the the town has actually kind of adopted uh the unit which is called
[3:35:18.560 --> 3:35:23.840]  company a first battalion 168 infantry uh it really has adopted the unit
[3:35:23.840 --> 3:35:27.760]  considers them uh their soldiers and uh they were they were more than willing
[3:35:27.760 --> 3:35:31.760]  to participate in the exercise okay sir um
[3:35:31.760 --> 3:35:35.680]  depending on how many questions i can ask uh can we have you for the 20 minutes
[3:35:35.680 --> 3:35:39.120]  or so whatever you need okay great we'll have it at the end of the
[3:35:39.120 --> 3:35:43.920]  show then that's about 24 minutes um specifically this is a very well informed
[3:35:43.920 --> 3:35:47.040]  audience and i and i know all these all this training has dual use
[3:35:47.040 --> 3:35:51.440]  you certainly know about pdd 51 and the john war defense authorization act
[3:35:51.440 --> 3:35:54.960]  that the national guard is being federalized um now
[3:35:54.960 --> 3:35:58.400]  and that the pentagon three months ago announced that and that the governors
[3:35:58.400 --> 3:36:02.160]  will serve as dual-headed officers as federal officers
[3:36:02.160 --> 3:36:05.680]  or if you're not aware of this you can tell us but um they're also saying that
[3:36:05.680 --> 3:36:10.480]  they're going to have 20 000 uh as part of the brigade's homeland
[3:36:10.480 --> 3:36:15.120]  for civil insurrection for rioting and i've been to urban war fred reels over
[3:36:15.120 --> 3:36:18.720]  the years uh in fact guys google uh police day 2000
[3:36:18.720 --> 3:36:22.160]  let's pull up some urban warfare footage i shot myself with the marines and army
[3:36:22.160 --> 3:36:24.720]  uh the marines are now running dui checkpoints
[3:36:24.720 --> 3:36:28.400]  homeland brigades is they're going to help it car wrecks with the jaws of life
[3:36:28.400 --> 3:36:32.160]  so so i mean i'm just laying out some facts there are you aware that there's
[3:36:32.160 --> 3:36:37.600]  now a massive domestic role uh for the regular army and national guard in the
[3:36:37.600 --> 3:36:41.920]  united states but i think you have to look historically is that that domestic
[3:36:41.920 --> 3:36:46.000]  role really has been filled by the national guard across the united states
[3:36:46.000 --> 3:36:49.680]  for decades and in iowa we're no different um for instance
[3:36:49.680 --> 3:36:53.280]  last summer we had incredibly historic floods
[3:36:53.280 --> 3:36:57.520]  here in the state the number one response uh force for many military is
[3:36:57.520 --> 3:36:59.920]  always the national guard in their home state
[3:36:59.920 --> 3:37:04.560]  and uh we deployed more than 4 000 people last summer to fight floods in iowa
[3:37:04.560 --> 3:37:09.120]  that being said if there are other kinds of response necessary in the state and
[3:37:09.120 --> 3:37:12.160]  typically the responses that we really have to do with are
[3:37:12.160 --> 3:37:16.480]  most of the time natural disasters uh but in the event of other disasters let's
[3:37:16.480 --> 3:37:19.280]  say some kind of weapons of mass destruction or some other kind of
[3:37:19.280 --> 3:37:23.360]  incident we'd be also called upon to do that so so i do have some visibility on
[3:37:23.360 --> 3:37:28.080]  that duty as well colonel if you are ordered to confiscate
[3:37:28.080 --> 3:37:32.800]  citizens firearms under pdd 25 or pdd 51 are you
[3:37:32.800 --> 3:37:36.880]  going to follow that order uh with respect to any kind of duty that we
[3:37:36.880 --> 3:37:40.720]  perform in iowa um it kind of depends on on which
[3:37:40.720 --> 3:37:43.680]  status it's in about who we take orders from number one
[3:37:43.680 --> 3:37:48.160]  uh if it is in a peacetime situation the vast majority of the time
[3:37:48.160 --> 3:37:52.880]  any kind of request for assistance comes from the governor of the state of
[3:37:52.880 --> 3:37:56.000]  iowa i can tell you that the order of which you just spoke
[3:37:56.000 --> 3:38:00.240]  has never been received by the iowa national guard
[3:38:00.240 --> 3:38:03.520]  and i can tell you that you will not find
[3:38:03.520 --> 3:38:07.520]  stronger defenders of the constitution than the men and women of the iowa
[3:38:07.520 --> 3:38:11.440]  national guard well i remember back in 2002 seeing
[3:38:11.440 --> 3:38:14.480]  local newscasts with iowa national guard not in drills
[3:38:14.480 --> 3:38:18.560]  but out on the highways searching cars and then telling the news cameras to
[3:38:18.560 --> 3:38:21.680]  turn off were you in the garden or were you aware of that
[3:38:21.680 --> 3:38:25.120]  i went to the guard for 23 years and i've never heard of that
[3:38:25.120 --> 3:38:29.520]  it was on iowa no news channels i've been a member of the iowa national guard
[3:38:29.520 --> 3:38:33.280]  since 1986 and i've been in public affairs since 1991 i
[3:38:33.280 --> 3:38:36.640]  didn't i do not recall uh ever in a situation
[3:38:36.640 --> 3:38:41.280]  all right well let's just boil it down to this i have video of army and marines
[3:38:41.280 --> 3:38:44.640]  with role-players screaming i'm an american please don't put me in the
[3:38:44.640 --> 3:38:47.840]  camp uh and the military training to confiscate their
[3:38:47.840 --> 3:38:50.960]  firearms i mean certainly you've heard the army times and the new director from
[3:38:50.960 --> 3:38:55.120]  secretary of defense robert gates that they will use the national guard under
[3:38:55.120 --> 3:38:58.320]  federal control uh for civil insurrection or are you
[3:38:58.320 --> 3:39:01.600]  saying you're not aware of that no i'm certainly aware that absolutely but i
[3:39:01.600 --> 3:39:04.800]  think you have to look at the role the national guard historically
[3:39:04.800 --> 3:39:09.360]  is that historically um we are used uh in states
[3:39:09.360 --> 3:39:15.440]  uh for disasters overwhelmingly and our job is to number one be ready
[3:39:15.440 --> 3:39:19.440]  for our mission federally which is to go to war
[3:39:19.440 --> 3:39:23.520]  and number two is to help our fellow citizens of the united states of america
[3:39:23.520 --> 3:39:27.360]  but the army that we prepare for and train for the army war college
[3:39:27.360 --> 3:39:30.960]  three weeks ago issued a report saying they're shifting a lot of their focus
[3:39:30.960 --> 3:39:35.840]  to engaging the american people and directives on engagement with the
[3:39:35.840 --> 3:39:39.680]  american people under north com now this isn't you know we
[3:39:39.680 --> 3:39:44.160]  north com isn't you know part of our history uh the the national guard being
[3:39:44.160 --> 3:39:49.600]  federalized as a full integrated force that is new that is different
[3:39:49.600 --> 3:39:53.600]  well you gotta remember that the national guard 99 percent of the time
[3:39:53.600 --> 3:39:58.560]  is in if you're talking about peacetime belongs to the state in which they are
[3:39:58.560 --> 3:40:02.400]  located uh only on occasion to become federalized one of
[3:40:02.400 --> 3:40:05.280]  those examples of course is being mobilized and deployed
[3:40:05.280 --> 3:40:08.720]  to go to war or peacekeeping or other kinds of federalized missions
[3:40:08.720 --> 3:40:12.400]  but other than that the national guard generally in peacetime belongs to the
[3:40:12.400 --> 3:40:20.160]  governor of that state absolutely um you know
[3:40:20.160 --> 3:40:23.760]  we know that they're federalizing the police we know that
[3:40:23.760 --> 3:40:28.480]  national guard and regular army on abc news and nbc in high and dry areas
[3:40:28.480 --> 3:40:31.760]  went in handcuffed americans and confiscated their firearms
[3:40:31.760 --> 3:40:36.160]  uh in new orleans and surrounding areas we know that the city officials were
[3:40:36.160 --> 3:40:40.960]  told to stand down i've had them on we also know that i've had state reps on
[3:40:40.960 --> 3:40:43.440]  probably more than 20 of them the last three weeks
[3:40:43.440 --> 3:40:47.040]  saying they're passing 10th amendment resolutions preparing
[3:40:47.040 --> 3:40:50.320]  uh to tell the state police and others to resist
[3:40:50.320 --> 3:40:54.640]  federal occupation of the states because the pentagon's directive says that
[3:40:54.640 --> 3:40:58.000]  the governors will be federal officers serving at the pleasure
[3:40:58.000 --> 3:41:02.240]  of the president that the congress under pdd 51 you can go read it sir i bet
[3:41:02.240 --> 3:41:05.360]  you've even seen the classified version of red parts of it congress isn't even
[3:41:05.360 --> 3:41:08.160]  allowed to see that by the way what you've been allowed to see congress was
[3:41:08.160 --> 3:41:11.360]  told i mean is that how the branches of government work is to have congress
[3:41:11.360 --> 3:41:16.240]  told they can't see all of pdd 51 i mean i gotta be out of the i'm not
[3:41:16.240 --> 3:41:19.600]  here for political discussion i work for the people united states of america i'm
[3:41:19.600 --> 3:41:23.280]  a soldier every day i put on the uniform of politics i leave that to the
[3:41:23.280 --> 3:41:26.560]  politicians as well as a lot of they told you about the president we're hearing
[3:41:26.560 --> 3:41:30.160]  about this new oath to the president i mean if they explained that the congress
[3:41:30.160 --> 3:41:33.520]  is co-equal at least with the with the executive
[3:41:33.520 --> 3:41:37.680]  uh i mean the constitution clearly sets aside the three branch the government
[3:41:37.680 --> 3:41:41.840]  as the defining way in which uh we find our political means here in the united
[3:41:41.840 --> 3:41:44.480]  states america and i would defer to the coast
[3:41:44.480 --> 3:41:48.240]  well thank you i that's that's heartening because this is mainstream news
[3:41:48.240 --> 3:41:50.880]  that for a year the homeland security committee
[3:41:50.880 --> 3:41:55.840]  in congress has asked to see pdd 51 in its entirety on the front page says the
[3:41:55.840 --> 3:41:59.440]  president's dictator under any emergency and they're not allowed to see it i
[3:41:59.440 --> 3:42:02.880]  mean uh that sounds like some third world country
[3:42:02.880 --> 3:42:07.040]  yeah i i mean what i can tell you about what we do here in iowa
[3:42:07.040 --> 3:42:10.320]  is number one defend the constitution united states
[3:42:10.320 --> 3:42:14.000]  and number two provide assistance to the people of iowa in times of need
[3:42:14.000 --> 3:42:16.560]  those are the things that we're concerned about those are the things that we
[3:42:16.560 --> 3:42:19.840]  train about all right let me just ask you this
[3:42:19.840 --> 3:42:26.000]  question sir um can you go over i guess did you or
[3:42:26.000 --> 3:42:28.720]  someone else give an interview to this daily times herald because
[3:42:28.720 --> 3:42:33.120]  this has them shutting down part of the town going door to door
[3:42:33.120 --> 3:42:37.920]  and and and and asking about firearms and pictures on the walls asking where's
[3:42:37.920 --> 3:42:42.320]  the arms dealer uh and and now we're hearing the military
[3:42:42.320 --> 3:42:45.440]  may be used you know to go after guns i mean i'm having
[3:42:45.440 --> 3:42:50.000]  congressman on about this sir i mean i had two congressmen on the show who
[3:42:50.000 --> 3:42:53.120]  were threatened with martial law by the presidency
[3:42:53.120 --> 3:42:56.160]  under bush if they didn't pass the bailout bill and i'm just trying to
[3:42:56.160 --> 3:42:59.520]  educate you but obviously you know all this i mean i i mean
[3:42:59.520 --> 3:43:02.240]  tell us what's going on with the drill i mean is this accurate what's in the
[3:43:02.240 --> 3:43:05.120]  article well what i can tell you from the article
[3:43:05.120 --> 3:43:08.000]  was that again it's simply a training event we are
[3:43:08.000 --> 3:43:12.160]  simulating those kinds of environments that our soldiers go into an iraq and
[3:43:12.160 --> 3:43:17.280]  afghanistan specifically in harm's way to conduct these kinds of missions
[3:43:17.280 --> 3:43:21.280]  again we don't have any any kind of extensive urban training environment
[3:43:21.280 --> 3:43:24.560]  in the state of iowa as we don't have any active duty bases here
[3:43:24.560 --> 3:43:28.880]  that being said it's our job to be able to give our taxpayers the absolute best
[3:43:28.880 --> 3:43:32.560]  value we can for their dollar by providing our soldiers with the best
[3:43:32.560 --> 3:43:35.520]  training possible with those resources that we have
[3:43:35.520 --> 3:43:38.800]  so that's exactly what we're doing it has to do with training for combat
[3:43:38.800 --> 3:43:43.280]  missions um not for any kind of mission here in the united states
[3:43:43.280 --> 3:43:46.720]  sir they've had urban soldiers doing they've had urban warfare drills with
[3:43:46.720 --> 3:43:50.960]  the marines of the army all over the country right next to military bases
[3:43:50.960 --> 3:43:55.440]  and i always hear this psi op you know as the people are subdued in the info
[3:43:55.440 --> 3:43:58.960]  war that oh we need this for real life you know this
[3:43:58.960 --> 3:44:03.440]  in that i'm showing on screen right now video of marines interrogating role
[3:44:03.440 --> 3:44:06.000]  players saying that they're from san francisco
[3:44:06.000 --> 3:44:08.960]  okay on screen right now they're asking to get the role player where he's from
[3:44:08.960 --> 3:44:12.400]  he's saying i'm from san francisco they're asking him where he got weapons
[3:44:12.400 --> 3:44:15.520]  in fact can we fade the audio up with this
[3:44:15.520 --> 3:44:18.560]  back it up about 15 seconds and i want folks to hear this right now
[3:44:18.560 --> 3:44:22.640]  i mean i want this kernel to hear this because i've been there i mean i know
[3:44:22.640 --> 3:44:25.360]  what's going on i know they tried to hire smithley butler
[3:44:25.360 --> 3:44:29.040]  uh it was the top marine in the country to have marshal on 35 i mean sir you
[3:44:29.040 --> 3:44:32.320]  know historically there's a danger of militaries being used by the executive
[3:44:32.320 --> 3:44:35.920]  branch to subdued populations and there's talk of breakdown of society and
[3:44:35.920 --> 3:44:39.920]  rioting right now well i mean what i can tell you is only
[3:44:39.920 --> 3:44:43.280]  what we do here in iowa that's to be prepared to go to war be prepared to
[3:44:43.280 --> 3:44:47.360]  help people here in the united states those are the things that we do
[3:44:47.360 --> 3:44:51.440]  so what if there's a situation like new orleans and you're told to go
[3:44:51.440 --> 3:44:54.560]  into people's houses and confiscate their firearms i mean
[3:44:54.560 --> 3:44:58.000]  they did that in louisiana and mississippi or i mean would you be part of
[3:44:58.000 --> 3:45:02.160]  that in iowa well we have we haven't been asked to do that in the state of iowan
[3:45:02.160 --> 3:45:06.720]  history of our state we've been around for 170 years the iowa national guard we
[3:45:06.720 --> 3:45:10.560]  start as a territorial militia um and like i said
[3:45:10.560 --> 3:45:14.160]  we uphold the constitution and advocate for the constitution
[3:45:14.160 --> 3:45:17.760]  um every day and what we do and what i but things are different now that's the
[3:45:17.760 --> 3:45:21.040]  whole point sir we know we know you've been around for a long time
[3:45:21.040 --> 3:45:24.160]  the point is things are changing that's the whole point we're trying to make
[3:45:24.160 --> 3:45:28.400]  kernel but the point that i'm trying to make is you you've
[3:45:28.400 --> 3:45:32.560]  trotted out this parade of horribles of which i can't possibly comment
[3:45:32.560 --> 3:45:35.360]  all i can tell you about is what we do here in iowa to get ready that's
[3:45:35.360 --> 3:45:37.200]  specifically where i'm gonna talk to you about
[3:45:37.200 --> 3:45:40.560]  yes sir kernel we appreciate that we respect your your your
[3:45:40.560 --> 3:45:43.120]  you know the fact you're being cordial while you're being interrogated it's
[3:45:43.120 --> 3:45:46.880]  just we're upset because we're educated we know what's going on
[3:45:46.880 --> 3:45:50.720]  and people are going to remember what you've said here today as things unfold
[3:45:50.720 --> 3:45:54.240]  understand we've told the whole world what's going on we know what's going on
[3:45:54.240 --> 3:45:58.480]  i understand you're compartmentalized but uh you know you've got to really be
[3:45:58.480 --> 3:46:01.680]  having your head in the sand to not see what's going on i know this has dual
[3:46:01.680 --> 3:46:06.320]  use in macedonia or or iraq or afghanistan but i know and i've
[3:46:06.320 --> 3:46:09.600]  we've interviewed generals we've interviewed the former head of special
[3:46:09.600 --> 3:46:12.880]  forces on this show okay we've interviewed congressmen they know
[3:46:12.880 --> 3:46:16.480]  what's going on sir and i'm telling you you can't deny what's
[3:46:16.480 --> 3:46:19.920]  happening don't be like the people of germany or russia the military that
[3:46:19.920 --> 3:46:25.360]  denied and i denied was right in front of their face
[3:46:25.360 --> 3:46:31.120]  okay and again i can just tell you what i see here in front of me every day
[3:46:31.120 --> 3:46:34.320]  i see 9500 men and women that are committed to liberty
[3:46:34.320 --> 3:46:38.000]  that are committed to united states of america committed to the state of iowa
[3:46:38.000 --> 3:46:41.600]  doing the absolute best that they can do to take care of people
[3:46:41.600 --> 3:46:46.160]  that's what i can tell you about kernel lieutenant colonel did uh did i always
[3:46:46.160 --> 3:46:50.240]  send any guard trips to new orleans yes we did
[3:46:50.240 --> 3:46:53.680]  uh in fact i was there myself as well we did send
[3:46:53.680 --> 3:46:57.760]  um approximately 400 that were in mississippi and some that were also in
[3:46:57.760 --> 3:47:01.360]  new orleans as well did you take part in the gun confiscation
[3:47:01.360 --> 3:47:06.240]  uh we did not take part in any of those kinds of operations did you witness it
[3:47:06.240 --> 3:47:10.560]  did not the lair news hours reported as well as the uh
[3:47:10.560 --> 3:47:15.520]  other programs of bill moyer's that mercenaries were also used from israel
[3:47:15.520 --> 3:47:20.720]  and blackwater did you see those guys no information about that
[3:47:20.720 --> 3:47:24.960]  no information i mean you you you didn't see them or no information
[3:47:24.960 --> 3:47:28.000]  didn't personally see it
[3:47:28.720 --> 3:47:32.160]  what about the mexican trips that helped give everybody soup to set that
[3:47:32.160 --> 3:47:37.040]  precedent you see any of them um didn't see any of those either
[3:47:37.040 --> 3:47:40.080]  now kernel you're laughing a little you certainly know that
[3:47:40.080 --> 3:47:44.000]  mexican trips in new orleans in houston and austin and san Antonio
[3:47:44.000 --> 3:47:48.240]  gave support to the effort that's the first i've heard of it
[3:47:48.240 --> 3:47:52.320]  for uh please forgive my ignorance folks google for everybody because somebody
[3:47:52.320 --> 3:47:58.000]  not believe it mexican troops and aid new orleans and we'll put it up on
[3:47:58.000 --> 3:48:01.520]  screen for folks kernel i've been ranting at you i want to
[3:48:01.520 --> 3:48:04.320]  give you a few minutes to just you know talk about whatever you'd like and then
[3:48:04.320 --> 3:48:06.400]  i'd like to do a final five minutes with you
[3:48:06.400 --> 3:48:09.440]  going through this article i mean explaining exactly what they're going to
[3:48:09.440 --> 3:48:12.400]  do door to door with the houses what the checkpoints are going to be
[3:48:12.400 --> 3:48:16.000]  simulating sure um when you come out coordinate
[3:48:16.000 --> 3:48:19.120]  search operations you've got several different rings of security that you've
[3:48:19.120 --> 3:48:22.960]  got to provide in a particular area and then it's important that
[3:48:22.960 --> 3:48:26.000]  people are treated respectfully as you go house to house
[3:48:26.000 --> 3:48:29.600]  um as you're looking for certain items particularly in our experience in
[3:48:29.600 --> 3:48:35.040]  afghanistan and iraq looking for weapon caches whether those have ak-47s
[3:48:35.040 --> 3:48:40.160]  um rpg is rock repellent grenades that is uh any kind of ammunition or any kind
[3:48:40.160 --> 3:48:45.120]  of improvised explosive devices etc etc and our job when we go on a
[3:48:45.120 --> 3:48:48.080]  coordinate search is to locate those kinds of items
[3:48:48.080 --> 3:48:50.960]  and then there might also be persons interest that we're interested in
[3:48:50.960 --> 3:48:55.120]  that coalition forces want to talk to or apprehend so i mean simply
[3:48:55.120 --> 3:48:58.080]  because of the environment in which we live in iowa that we don't have an
[3:48:58.080 --> 3:49:01.440]  active duty base that we don't have a very extensive
[3:49:01.440 --> 3:49:04.720]  urban terrain environment available to us for training
[3:49:04.720 --> 3:49:09.120]  uh then we have to get creative and we do occasionally go into communities
[3:49:09.120 --> 3:49:12.480]  and work side by side with them to use the communities for our training and
[3:49:12.480 --> 3:49:15.760]  this is an example of that
[3:49:20.080 --> 3:49:23.760]  you know i you know kernel i find it really hard to believe
[3:49:23.760 --> 3:49:28.000]  that you don't know about what the guard did in iowa in 2002 when it was on the
[3:49:28.000 --> 3:49:30.320]  local newscast and we're going to dig those out
[3:49:30.320 --> 3:49:34.800]  and i really find it hard to believe um i mean i've had all these former top
[3:49:34.800 --> 3:49:37.120]  jag officers on saying this is police state
[3:49:37.120 --> 3:49:39.840]  martial law the news admits that's what's being set up
[3:49:39.840 --> 3:49:44.320]  they've built fema camps it's in the news millions of plastic coffins
[3:49:44.320 --> 3:49:48.560]  uh and and and we know this has been quietly being built and designed over
[3:49:48.560 --> 3:49:51.840]  decades and all these states are revolting
[3:49:51.840 --> 3:49:55.520]  against it and i talked to the military and it's just oh no this is for
[3:49:55.520 --> 3:49:58.640]  overseas or we're only here to help with i mean don't
[3:49:58.640 --> 3:50:02.080]  you admit this could be used dual use and could acclimate the local
[3:50:02.080 --> 3:50:06.160]  citizenry and the population uh to have their guns confiscated i mean that's
[3:50:06.160 --> 3:50:10.480]  what happened in new orleans all i can tell you is is what our intent is and
[3:50:10.480 --> 3:50:13.920]  our intent is provide prepared soldiers so they're ready to go
[3:50:13.920 --> 3:50:17.280]  when it comes time for them to go someplace very dangerous
[3:50:17.280 --> 3:50:21.120]  uh for them to not only do their missions successfully but survive and come
[3:50:21.120 --> 3:50:24.000]  home to their families those are the things that we do and what we see
[3:50:24.000 --> 3:50:26.640]  did you hear about governor blagojevich four months ago before he got
[3:50:26.640 --> 3:50:28.800]  disgraced said they were to use the national guard in
[3:50:28.800 --> 3:50:33.120]  illinois for door to door gun confiscation that's a different place
[3:50:33.120 --> 3:50:37.760]  we're talking about Iowa here not Illinois but but you know about the new
[3:50:37.760 --> 3:50:41.760]  pentagon directive for a unified force to basically
[3:50:41.760 --> 3:50:45.440]  taking away the state control of the national guard i mean that that word for
[3:50:45.440 --> 3:50:48.240]  word what robert gate says they're doing
[3:50:48.240 --> 3:50:53.920]  um with respect to politics again i'm gonna stay out of politics with you
[3:50:53.920 --> 3:50:56.080]  that's not my job okay we gotta break sir we gotta break
[3:50:56.080 --> 3:50:58.960]  colonel we gotta break but i mean this is not politics this is your oath we're
[3:50:58.960 --> 3:51:02.000]  talking about just stay there please
[3:51:02.000 --> 3:51:05.600]  phase one of the insiders plan for a one-world government has been initiated
[3:51:05.600 --> 3:51:08.960]  with the recent bailout international bankers and power brokers
[3:51:08.960 --> 3:51:12.800]  have engineered the current crisis to create a new currency and a new world
[3:51:12.800 --> 3:51:15.920]  bank to act as savior but we've only seen the beginning
[3:51:15.920 --> 3:51:19.520]  their next engineered crisis will be on a scale never before seen in modern
[3:51:19.520 --> 3:51:22.480]  times shortages and empty shelves will spread fear
[3:51:22.480 --> 3:51:26.160]  and panic across the land the insiders have discovered that they must control
[3:51:26.160 --> 3:51:30.960]  two things to seize total power phase one is a one-world currency which we are
[3:51:30.960 --> 3:51:34.720]  currently being prepared to accept phase two of their insidious plan is

[3:54:14.320 --> 3:54:18.080]  colonel are you guys going to have any live ammo or will it be blanks
[3:54:18.080 --> 3:54:22.080]  flashbangs we've seen other drills with the army blows up cars here in texas
[3:54:22.080 --> 3:54:24.560]  and then the mayor announces they've really been attacked by terrorist
[3:54:24.560 --> 3:54:28.000]  with a sigh-off and then the day later announced they hadn't been belted
[3:54:28.000 --> 3:54:31.840]  what's going on with the ammo but i mean it really depends on on where it is
[3:54:31.840 --> 3:54:34.400]  that we're training and what the actual task is
[3:54:34.400 --> 3:54:37.360]  generally in training we use blank ammunition
[3:54:37.360 --> 3:54:41.360]  and only under very carefully controlled circumstances
[3:54:41.360 --> 3:54:44.880]  at a facility that can really handle a lot of live ammunition
[3:54:44.880 --> 3:54:49.040]  so would we go to a live fire exercise but generally in the state of Iowa
[3:54:49.040 --> 3:54:52.640]  while we're training it's always with some kind of blank ammunition
[3:54:52.640 --> 3:54:56.800]  generally earlier but you're so that means sometimes you do have live ammo
[3:54:56.800 --> 3:55:00.800]  but we do not train in Iowa with live ammunition
[3:55:00.800 --> 3:55:04.880]  we do do range fire here which is to make sure that you're proficient on your
[3:55:04.880 --> 3:55:08.160]  particular weapons that you're assigned but other than that we don't do live
[3:55:08.160 --> 3:55:10.240]  fire training exercises here in Iowa
[3:55:10.240 --> 3:55:13.040]  well you're pretty informed on all these issues obviously you're in the middle of it
[3:55:13.040 --> 3:55:16.480]  have you heard about the mainstream news articles about marines and california
[3:55:16.480 --> 3:55:20.400]  and other places helping at dwi checkpoints with citizens would that
[3:55:20.400 --> 3:55:24.160]  to violate posse commentatus i'm not aware of that
[3:55:24.160 --> 3:55:28.320]  with respect to active duty military uh... that's called title 10
[3:55:28.320 --> 3:55:31.600]  when you're on active duty and uh... they're not allowed
[3:55:31.600 --> 3:55:36.080]  to participate in certain kinds of operations under the posse commentatus
[3:55:36.080 --> 3:55:40.160]  act we got secret memorandums at an army checkpoint
[3:55:40.160 --> 3:55:44.960]  in i-35 uh... back in 1998 it's in my film police
[3:55:44.960 --> 3:55:49.360]  stayed to the takeover and the the fb i showed up because the army was telling
[3:55:49.360 --> 3:55:52.640]  us get out of there so they called the fb i the guy gave us the cover sheet but
[3:55:52.640 --> 3:55:57.200]  actually stapled secret memorandum marked restricted
[3:55:57.200 --> 3:56:01.040]  477 counties saying we want to help you with warrent service at homes
[3:56:01.040 --> 3:56:04.480]  we're here to help you do you guys have secret memorandums like that in iowa
[3:56:04.480 --> 3:56:07.680]  no we don't participate in those kind of operations
[3:56:07.680 --> 3:56:11.200]  you ever heard of any other states doing that i have not
[3:56:11.200 --> 3:56:14.320]  what about like even the this national guard like in alabama
[3:56:14.320 --> 3:56:17.920]  comes out to sporting events and searches people's bags and things you do you
[3:56:17.920 --> 3:56:22.240]  guys participate in that no we do not like the army of the super bowl
[3:56:22.240 --> 3:56:24.800]  searching people you guys don't don't take part in that
[3:56:24.800 --> 3:56:27.760]  no we don't take part in that does that sound like freedom to you all over the
[3:56:27.760 --> 3:56:29.360]  country to have the national guard at
[3:56:29.360 --> 3:56:33.280]  uh... big events like the conducting derby in the super bowl searching bags
[3:56:33.280 --> 3:56:36.880]  well i think if you're talking about keeping americans safe uh... it's our
[3:56:36.880 --> 3:56:40.080]  job to do to rekindle to help them with that
[3:56:40.080 --> 3:56:45.120]  and um... if if our job happens to be to detect weapons mass destruction
[3:56:45.120 --> 3:56:48.560]  or other kinds of things that could harm a great deal people uh... that's what we
[3:56:48.560 --> 3:56:53.840]  do um... you know certainly again we absolutely believe in the constitution
[3:56:53.840 --> 3:56:57.360]  and that you won't find better patriots and people in the national guard
[3:56:57.360 --> 3:57:01.040]  last time i was down in central america there was military out searching people
[3:57:01.040 --> 3:57:02.640]  i mean it to me is is that
[3:57:02.640 --> 3:57:05.600]  the classic image of freedom you know keeping us safe from wmd searching
[3:57:05.600 --> 3:57:08.720]  three-year-olds purses so we have photos of that
[3:57:08.720 --> 3:57:12.720]  well i mean all i can tell you is is what we do here now and what and what we
[3:57:12.720 --> 3:57:14.800]  see uh... in our operations
[3:57:14.800 --> 3:57:19.200]  for instance uh... we were just asked to take part in auguration washington dc
[3:57:19.200 --> 3:57:22.800]  our job there was to help make keep sure people got the right places
[3:57:22.800 --> 3:57:26.000]  uh... make sure that people were safe and um... those are the kinds of missions
[3:57:26.000 --> 3:57:29.360]  though that were generally asked to do but you're saying that's not a violation
[3:57:29.360 --> 3:57:32.320]  of posse commentatus to have the national guard now completely
[3:57:32.320 --> 3:57:34.960]  federalized searching people's backs
[3:57:34.960 --> 3:57:38.720]  no i didn't say that uh... in fact what i can tell you about the iowa national
[3:57:38.720 --> 3:57:42.560]  guard is we're generally in a state status on operations
[3:57:42.560 --> 3:57:45.760]  unless of course we're deployed for war then we'd be in a federal status but
[3:57:45.760 --> 3:57:48.880]  generally if we're gonna work here in the united states somewhere
[3:57:48.880 --> 3:57:53.280]  are generally uh... on a state status of some kind which is a lot of status
[3:57:53.280 --> 3:57:56.320]  are you guys getting a lot of phone calls about this right now
[3:57:56.320 --> 3:58:00.000]  uh... we actually have gotten a number of phone calls about this and uh... but i
[3:58:00.000 --> 3:58:03.200]  think the biggest misnomer is that is once people find out
[3:58:03.200 --> 3:58:06.880]  if the actual mission is about replicating training
[3:58:06.880 --> 3:58:10.560]  so we can go to war then then they're okay with that so after folks i think it's
[3:58:10.560 --> 3:58:14.640]  a misconception that that has anything to do with other than combat readiness
[3:58:14.640 --> 3:58:17.760]  yeah well i've seen the documents interviewed folks above your pay grade
[3:58:17.760 --> 3:58:20.400]  lieutenant colonel i'm sorry to tell you you are wrong

[3:58:23.600 --> 3:58:26.720]  community is being acclimated for martial law the fema camps are now
