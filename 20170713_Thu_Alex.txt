[00:00.000 --> 00:06.700]  To say this transmission is important today on this Thursday live global edition is an
[00:06.700 --> 00:08.200]  understatement.
[00:08.200 --> 00:11.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a key transmission.
[00:11.000 --> 00:19.000]  The Inquisition, want to show the Inquisition, here we go, we know your wish and that we
[00:19.000 --> 00:20.000]  go away.
[00:20.000 --> 00:25.000]  But the Inquisition's here and it's here to stay.
[00:25.000 --> 00:30.000]  General Election Commission Democratic Commissioner Ellen Weintraub wants Americans to know that
[00:30.000 --> 00:34.560]  she is doing everything she can to get to the bottom of foreign money influencing the
[00:34.560 --> 00:35.560]  media.
[00:35.560 --> 00:41.840]  Dropping the gauntlet on American media sites including Info Wars, Drudge Report and Breitbart.
[00:41.840 --> 00:44.760]  Support for our present Commander-in-Chief Donald Trump.
[00:44.760 --> 00:50.000]  That appears to be an alien concept to Weintraub and the rest of the radical left.
[00:50.000 --> 00:55.000]  I'm Ellen Weintraub, I'm a Commissioner on the Federal Election Commission, an agency
[00:55.000 --> 01:01.000]  that should be in the forefront of the battle for a stronger democracy, for cleaner elections,
[01:01.000 --> 01:07.000]  for a more representative and responsive government, a government by, for and of all
[01:07.000 --> 01:08.000]  of its people.
[01:08.000 --> 01:09.000]  A lot about all that Chinese money, lady.
[01:09.000 --> 01:13.000]  It's another person that's all into she's on the Federal Election Commission and she
[01:13.000 --> 01:15.000]  says this and she says that.
[01:15.000 --> 01:19.000]  These are the same people that say churches don't have a right to be pro-life because
[01:19.000 --> 01:20.000]  they're political.
[01:20.000 --> 01:25.000]  The First Amendment says Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion
[01:25.000 --> 01:27.000]  or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[01:27.000 --> 01:32.000]  But the Democrats have intimidated Christian churches, conservative churches, libertarian
[01:32.000 --> 01:37.240]  churches, patriot churches into having no views on anything as if you have no free speech
[01:37.240 --> 01:39.680]  because it's a violation of church and state.
[01:39.680 --> 01:44.320]  Church and state is state-run religion and the government endorsing one religion, aka
[01:44.320 --> 01:47.000]  Islam, is unconstitutional.
[01:47.000 --> 01:52.480]  Trump is following Time Magazine's lead, claiming that Russian money bought political ads on
[01:52.480 --> 01:53.480]  Facebook.
[01:53.480 --> 01:57.240]  Thus, alternative medium must be in Putin's pocket.
[01:57.240 --> 02:02.400]  I had spoken about whether those Facebook ads would be subject to FEC regulation and
[02:02.400 --> 02:07.420]  they would be because we do have jurisdiction over any advertised money that is spent on
[02:07.420 --> 02:11.440]  advertising whether it's on the Internet or in other fora.
[02:11.440 --> 02:16.960]  I have spoken out on many occasions about my concern about the potential for foreign
[02:16.960 --> 02:21.200]  money creeping into our system and have tried on numerous occasions to introduce stronger
[02:21.200 --> 02:24.640]  rules to the FEC to try and ward that off.
[02:24.640 --> 02:30.760]  Wontrop's FEC memorandum states, this is an all-hands-on-deck moment for our democracy.
[02:30.760 --> 02:35.920]  Former Vice President Dick Cheney has said that Russia's alleged actions could be considered
[02:35.920 --> 02:39.280]  an act of war against the United States.
[02:39.280 --> 02:44.760]  Every part of our government that has jurisdiction over these issues must exercise every scrap
[02:44.760 --> 02:48.160]  of its jurisdiction as fully as it can.
[02:48.160 --> 02:53.360]  Wontrop told Politico if there are U.S. citizens involved in any way in spending foreign money
[02:53.360 --> 02:59.040]  to influence a U.S. election, then that would be something that we could and should pursue.
[02:59.040 --> 03:01.280]  We're at the FEC today.
[03:01.280 --> 03:05.880]  We are providing her with the evidence that she demands, evidence of a busing and rental
[03:05.880 --> 03:12.080]  car program to be able to move voters across state lines, evidence of paid protesters,
[03:12.080 --> 03:18.280]  and evidence of illegal coordination that occurred during the 2016 election.
[03:18.280 --> 03:21.280]  You were looking for proof of voter fraud, right?
[03:21.280 --> 03:22.280]  Yeah.
[03:22.280 --> 03:28.200]  Are you aware that Project Veritas Action submitted a FEC complaint about approving that
[03:28.200 --> 03:29.200]  voter fraud?
[03:29.200 --> 03:32.800]  I can't talk about anything that is under consideration.
[03:32.800 --> 03:38.280]  Of course, the rotting fruits of hubris and hypocrisy don't fall far from the Democratic
[03:38.280 --> 03:39.280]  Tree.
[03:39.280 --> 03:43.000]  Wontrop should know all about foreign donations and influence.
[03:43.000 --> 03:44.600]  She thrives on them.
[03:44.600 --> 03:50.520]  The Daily Caller reports, since 2002, the FEC's three Democratic members took at least
[03:50.520 --> 03:56.480]  50 official trips during their combined time serving on the agency, according to documents
[03:56.480 --> 04:00.080]  obtained from the public records and FOIA requests.
[04:00.080 --> 04:04.880]  Voters related to the trips were paid by a combination of foreign groups, governments,
[04:04.880 --> 04:08.800]  and by U.S. taxpayers through the agency's own budget.
[04:08.800 --> 04:14.120]  Records reveal Wontrop has taken at least 30 foreign trips since she joined the agency
[04:14.120 --> 04:15.560]  in 2003.
[04:15.560 --> 04:20.640]  The nonprofit International Foundation for Electoral Systems, for instance, paid more
[04:20.640 --> 04:25.280]  than $9,000 for Wontrop to spend over a week in Indonesia.
[04:25.280 --> 04:30.920]  In another instance, Wontrop met socialist leaders for a gourmet meal in Albania.
[04:30.920 --> 04:36.640]  Her trips also include junkets to the Philippines, Mexico, Honduras, and El Salvador.
[04:36.640 --> 04:41.640]  The purpose of the trips ranged from attending political conferences to observing foreign
[04:41.640 --> 04:46.880]  elections and spanned more than two dozen countries covering five continents.
[04:46.880 --> 04:53.120]  None of the FEC's Republican members have taken a single agency-related international
[04:53.120 --> 04:54.120]  trip.
[04:54.120 --> 04:58.560]  One question remains, who is Ellen Weintraub working for?
[04:58.560 --> 05:24.760]  Here's the truth about the Don Jr. emails.
[05:24.760 --> 05:28.880]  And if he had known her name prior to the meeting, Don Jr. would have known she had Obama fingerprints
[05:28.880 --> 05:30.080]  all over her.
[05:30.080 --> 05:33.920]  She was potentially in the country illegally, only in the country temporarily thanks to Obama's
[05:33.920 --> 05:34.920]  Department of Justice.
[05:34.920 --> 05:38.320]  However, that stay had expired previous to her meeting Don Jr.
[05:38.320 --> 05:41.760]  Eight days after the meeting, she was sitting next to Obama's Russian ambassador during
[05:41.760 --> 05:43.760]  a foreign affairs committee hearing.
[05:43.760 --> 05:47.240]  So Tim Kaine, is Obama's DOJ guilty of treason?
[05:47.240 --> 05:50.720]  Who knew she was here illegally, and why no investigation into that?
[05:50.720 --> 05:56.120]  Vezel Nikhaya's alleged law firm in Russia has no website, no working phone, and no email.
[05:56.120 --> 05:59.720]  For Infowars.com, who is Natalia Vezel Nikhaya?
[05:59.720 --> 06:00.720]  This is Ellen Troyer.
[06:00.720 --> 06:05.520]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[06:05.520 --> 06:10.240]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[06:10.240 --> 06:11.760]  to detoxify the body.
[06:11.760 --> 06:16.640]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[06:16.640 --> 06:18.160]  It's made in the USA.
[06:18.160 --> 06:23.040]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[06:23.040 --> 06:24.880]  the body, and it supports the Info War.
[06:24.880 --> 06:27.160]  It is a classical 360 win.
[06:27.160 --> 06:31.640]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe
[06:31.640 --> 06:36.720]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[06:36.720 --> 06:40.520]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this
[06:40.520 --> 06:45.560]  country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you
[06:45.560 --> 06:50.760]  can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the
[06:50.760 --> 06:53.480]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[06:53.480 --> 06:56.760]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[06:56.760 --> 07:00.760]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield at InfoWarsLife.com.
[07:00.760 --> 07:04.480]  A new shipment of Biotrusillinium is now available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[07:04.480 --> 07:06.360]  We've been sold out for months.
[07:06.360 --> 07:11.480]  Our one-of-a-kind InfoWarsLife Biotrusillinium formula is now back in stock at InfoWarsLife.com.
[07:11.480 --> 07:15.680]  This is the true selenium formula that has rocked the nutraceutical industry to its core.
[07:15.680 --> 07:20.120]  Nearly every other selenium supplement on the market is produced with synthetic selenium,
[07:20.120 --> 07:25.240]  but Biotrusillinium is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seed.
[07:25.240 --> 07:28.760]  The effects of the essential trace mineral selenium are well known.
[07:28.760 --> 07:33.800]  From supporting the thyroid gland and immune system to DNA production and eyesight, Biotrusillinium
[07:33.800 --> 07:38.960]  is also the perfect supercharger to survive a shield X2 nascent iodine as both help support
[07:38.960 --> 07:40.720]  a healthy thyroid and many other systems.
[07:40.720 --> 07:45.760]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com to order your bottle of Biotrusillinium before we sell out again.
[07:45.760 --> 07:50.160]  That's InfoWarsLife.com to secure your selenium and other key products that don't only help
[07:50.160 --> 07:54.960]  yourself and your family, but also fund our operation against the globalist, A360WIN.
[07:54.960 --> 07:57.040]  We didn't ask for this fight, but we're in this fight.
[07:57.040 --> 07:58.560]  This is the time to support InfoWars.
[07:58.560 --> 08:26.120]  This is InfoWarsLife.com If you are receiving this transmission, you
[08:26.120 --> 08:51.120]  are
[08:51.120 --> 09:10.600]  the
[09:10.600 --> 09:16.560]  in the New York Times admits it is a group set up by President Obama to sue Trump.
[09:16.560 --> 09:20.400]  That was six months ago, Politico and the New York Times reported that.
[09:20.400 --> 09:23.080]  Now they are suing him.
[09:23.080 --> 09:30.280]  These are former federal judges, former councils to the president, you name it, admittedly
[09:30.280 --> 09:37.240]  set up by Obama to sue President Trump and Roger Stone.
[09:37.240 --> 09:43.800]  Based on the heels of the Federal Election Commission that stands by while Hillary gets
[09:43.800 --> 09:50.080]  billions of dollars in foreign illegal campaign contributions and put Dinesh D'Souza in prison
[09:50.080 --> 09:55.720]  for nine months because he got five of his friends to bundle money and give money to
[09:55.720 --> 10:02.600]  a friend of his, his college roommate who was running for the Senate to take Hillary
[10:02.600 --> 10:04.200]  seat in New York.
[10:04.200 --> 10:11.880]  He goes to prison, no criminal record, former head of a federal agency, no criminal record
[10:11.880 --> 10:16.400]  previously, but Hillary can do whatever she wants, she can have illegal servers, she can
[10:16.400 --> 10:20.640]  lie about what's on the server, she can take hammers to the hard drives and admit they
[10:20.640 --> 10:29.360]  destroyed evidence and absconded and the corrupt FBI does nothing.
[10:29.360 --> 10:33.800]  Now I hate to tell you, see I told you so, but over the weekend I really looked at what
[10:33.800 --> 10:39.960]  happened with Donald Jr. and the only other place that got it right was Drudge Report.
[10:39.960 --> 10:47.760]  DrudgeReport.com and Informers.com by Saturday had it down, it was a set up, a set up and
[10:47.760 --> 10:54.440]  then I pointed out on Saturday and Sunday, that's why they hate me, John McCain sent
[10:54.440 --> 11:01.080]  his age to Russia to try to find dirt on Trump and they spent millions of FBI taxpayer dollars
[11:01.080 --> 11:11.680]  paying for the PP gate dossier that they now admit is completely made up and fake.
[11:11.680 --> 11:16.240]  And it goes on and on from there, so they're the ones in contact with the Russians, they're
[11:16.240 --> 11:22.240]  the ones asking for help from the Russians to go after Trump and couldn't find anything,
[11:22.240 --> 11:24.400]  so they just put out fake stuff.
[11:24.400 --> 11:29.440]  If talking to the Russians shows collusion or that the Russians hacked the election,
[11:29.440 --> 11:36.240]  the Democrats on record have done a hundred times what Donald Jr. did and it was directed
[11:36.240 --> 11:46.800]  by the neocons, by the rhinos, by the Democratic Party, the PR investigative Democratic Party
[11:46.800 --> 11:55.840]  group that they hired to do it is run by the Democratic Party, using GPS, all that garbage.
[11:55.840 --> 11:56.840]  It's incredible.
[11:56.840 --> 12:03.400]  So look at Drudge Report, Obama DOJ let the Russians in, yeah, she was a known spy, let
[12:03.400 --> 12:08.720]  her in, really a double triple agent, as I said, a Soros operative, I said that on Sunday,
[12:08.720 --> 12:19.200]  she fit the cutout, mystery surrounds her, Veslan Nitskaya, McCain wanted dirt on Trump
[12:19.200 --> 12:23.240]  from foreign spy.
[12:23.240 --> 12:29.400]  As usual, they've done 100 times on record what they claim Trump did.
[12:29.400 --> 12:34.240]  She was contacting him, contacting all those people constantly, got him in a room, in the
[12:34.240 --> 12:36.560]  middle of a campaign, okay, what's the dirt?
[12:36.560 --> 12:42.240]  Oh, I want to talk about sanctions, see, because that would have been illegal, to have her
[12:42.240 --> 12:49.600]  then ask, hey, we're going to give you some info if you give us policies that help Russia.
[12:49.600 --> 12:52.160]  That's what Hillary's really doing and caught doing.
[12:52.160 --> 12:55.840]  So see, they wanted to get that, they didn't get that.
[12:55.840 --> 13:01.240]  This woman is clearly a double or triple agent in my research view, or maybe she's a complete
[13:01.240 --> 13:06.640]  moron, either way she's still being used one way or the other.
[13:06.640 --> 13:13.760]  So revealed, ordinary citizen John McCain dispatched a trusted aide across the Atlantic
[13:13.760 --> 13:18.600]  to get dirty dossier from ex-spy after former British diplomat told them about blackmail
[13:18.600 --> 13:19.800]  tapes.
[13:19.800 --> 13:25.080]  And they were going over all this with a bunch of so-called Russian spies who were really
[13:25.080 --> 13:26.560]  foundation operatives.
[13:26.560 --> 13:33.680]  And let me tell you, they spent $5 billion the last six years just overthrowing Ukraine.
[13:33.680 --> 13:37.360]  Imagine how much they've spent in the Russia operation, which they admit they're running
[13:37.360 --> 13:40.480]  to overthrow Russia.
[13:40.480 --> 13:44.720]  On the news, they'll go, look, Russia's arresting people that are going into Orthodox churches
[13:44.720 --> 13:49.440]  and throwing feces on the cross or whatever, trying to cause riots, and then it turns out
[13:49.440 --> 13:54.040]  they're foreigners on CIA payroll.
[13:54.040 --> 13:59.480]  Believe me, if Russians come running into a church throwing feces on the cross, throw
[13:59.480 --> 14:01.720]  them out of the country, arrest them.
[14:01.720 --> 14:03.120]  It's the same deal.
[14:03.120 --> 14:05.120]  What do you think globalism is?
[14:05.120 --> 14:09.960]  It's a bunch of foreign interests that are above our laws with you and diplomatic immunity
[14:09.960 --> 14:15.360]  that the Rockefellers set up for themselves in the 1940s to take over the world, and we're
[14:15.360 --> 14:22.480]  sick of it, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan and the stinking corrupt globalist Vatican captured
[14:22.480 --> 14:31.720]  by the New World Order is not above the law, no more.
[14:31.720 --> 14:36.880]  So that's why they hate us, because we're loyal Americans and we also want prosperity
[14:36.880 --> 14:41.400]  and we're hardworking and we're focused and we're not afraid, and the people are listening
[14:41.400 --> 14:46.240]  and taking action, and the military is listening, and the police are listening, and most of
[14:46.240 --> 14:48.440]  the bureaucrats I run into are aware of what's happening.
[14:48.440 --> 14:54.040]  It's only the upper elites who, yeah, look like Anthony Weiner and Uma Abadi and Hillary
[14:54.040 --> 14:58.000]  Clinton, they're not elites, they're criminals who've been willing to be disingenuous and
[14:58.000 --> 15:03.320]  do bad things, so they're in control and we're digging them out of their holes right now.
[15:03.320 --> 15:07.440]  We're smoking them out, and they know it.
[15:07.440 --> 15:14.680]  Look at this headline, Obama lawyers team up to fight Trump, at least the Hill got
[15:14.680 --> 15:25.000]  it right, Politico admits Soros funded lawyers, Soros is funding the Obama lawyers, so Obama
[15:25.000 --> 15:30.520]  founded the group, they admit that right here in Politico, right here in the Hill, I saw
[15:30.520 --> 15:37.720]  some people going, oh, Jones says Obama sued Trump and Roger Stone, fake news, it's Obama's
[15:37.720 --> 15:42.040]  lawyers, yeah, he founds it, he talks about it the week he leaves office, he says they're
[15:42.040 --> 15:46.920]  gonna go after Trump, he says they're designed to take him down, they're designed to battle
[15:46.920 --> 15:54.040]  him, they're designed to fight him, they're designed to stop him, the president says,
[15:54.040 --> 16:01.040]  I set this up to go after Trump, that's the president suing Trump, the former president,
[16:01.040 --> 16:05.920]  this is unprecedented, and that's what I do here, folks, is I decode what's going on,
[16:05.920 --> 16:11.000]  I just cut right to the chase, this is George Soros, a foreign Nazi collaborator who's
[16:11.000 --> 16:16.120]  overthrown over 100 countries, total dirt bag, literally going after Roger Stone and
[16:16.120 --> 16:25.240]  President Trump, and then you've got the Federal Elections Commission, the Democrats
[16:25.240 --> 16:34.160]  on it, thank God, are contained, openly say they wanna make political speech talking,
[16:34.160 --> 16:39.840]  taxable, finable, and imprisonable, that's all over the news yesterday, they said that
[16:39.840 --> 16:49.680]  Trump Jr., Donnie Jr., talking, talking to this Russian lawyer was value transferred
[16:49.680 --> 16:55.360]  and so he wasn't declared, so it's a violation, I've never heard of such a cuckoo for Coco
[16:55.360 --> 17:04.320]  Puff's power grab, mission creep, playing God, megalomania, I don't have words to describe
[17:04.320 --> 17:09.200]  the, if you know the laws, which I do, I've been in the media 22 years, been on syndicated
[17:09.200 --> 17:17.680]  radio for 20, we have to follow all those laws in advertising, in campaigns, even though
[17:17.680 --> 17:21.480]  I've never really gotten heavily into being funded by campaigns, we've taken some money
[17:21.480 --> 17:24.880]  from folks running from Congress and things like that, you know, Tea Party candidates over
[17:24.880 --> 17:38.880]  the years, and it is just wild, wild to have them say that it's money, and so they have
[17:38.880 --> 17:43.880]  jurisdiction, he talks to somebody and so it's a campaign violation, just like they
[17:43.880 --> 17:49.200]  told churches in the 1940s and 50s, oh you stop having political views, under the First
[17:49.200 --> 17:52.400]  Amendment you don't have speech, no under the First Amendment, churches have total
[17:52.400 --> 17:59.080]  speech and are outside of federal law, because Congress shall make no law, respecting an
[17:59.080 --> 18:04.760]  establishment religion, or for every pre-exercise thereof, Congress shall make no law, respecting
[18:04.760 --> 18:11.120]  the establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or of the press,
[18:11.120 --> 18:16.920]  or of the people's right to assemble, and petition the government for a redress of grievances.
[18:16.920 --> 18:21.520]  First Amendment, First Amendment, but they've beaten everybody into submission, so now the
[18:21.520 --> 18:25.760]  headline of the New York Times last week was, Trump's made it safe for churches to have
[18:25.760 --> 18:32.600]  political speech, they always had it, your reign of bullying BS is over, and I'm just
[18:32.600 --> 18:48.240]  glad that Cooke's, like Ellen Weintraub, has reared her gorgon head to howl at the world
[18:48.240 --> 18:54.600]  that Donnie Jr. isn't even allowed to talk to people, because she said so, you don't
[18:54.600 --> 19:01.600]  open your fat mouth unless Ellen Weintraub said or she'll throw you in a prison, you
[19:01.600 --> 19:06.320]  don't make a film bigger than Michael Moore, second biggest film in documentary history,
[19:06.320 --> 19:12.120]  Ellen, Ellen Weintraub will have your ass thrown under the jail, because she's the boss, she's
[19:12.120 --> 19:17.120]  running things like Kim Jong-un around here, well good news lady, we ain't North Korea

[22:14.360 --> 22:18.640]  looting of stores and city shutdowns, and a crumbling infrastructure leaves our power

[24:32.880 --> 24:45.040]  Watch him become a delusional god, like that little wimp, Kim Jong-un or Nancy Pelosi, watch
[24:45.040 --> 25:02.400]  your prosperity fall apart, just like the Pied Piper let rats loose, just like.
[25:02.400 --> 25:07.320]  Let me get to this little enjoyable piece of good news before I tell you what's coming
[25:07.320 --> 25:11.640]  up with Megan Kelly.
[25:11.640 --> 25:19.520]  We're looking at a massive symphony of destruction when it comes to the Democrats, a symphony
[25:19.520 --> 25:31.240]  of clueless moronic behavior, clueless Pelosi, Schumer and I, the voices for winning back
[25:31.240 --> 25:51.760]  Congress, that's right, Schumer, Hillary Clinton, and then of course Pelosi, who every
[25:51.760 --> 25:58.760]  few days says George Bush is causing problems in the White House, she's so senile that she's
[25:58.760 --> 26:04.920]  got that rubber Botox plastic surgery head, I guess Megan Kelly's working towards being
[26:04.920 --> 26:10.680]  a Pelosi, and she says don't worry, they're winning, so here she is in the same interview
[26:10.680 --> 26:15.160]  yesterday babbling about believing George W. Bush, who hasn't been in office in eight
[26:15.160 --> 26:21.600]  and a half years, is in office and that they're winning, so please do never interrupt your
[26:21.600 --> 26:25.320]  enemy when they're destroying themselves, I think we should start a Nancy Pelosi fan
[26:25.320 --> 26:30.280]  club and work against these radical evil Democrats that are asking her to step down
[26:30.280 --> 26:31.280]  or be removed.
[26:31.280 --> 26:37.080]  No, she's doing a great job for America, a great job for our country, and we need to
[26:37.080 --> 26:43.520]  keep her there as long as possible, because libertarians and patriots are losing.
[26:43.520 --> 26:48.960]  I read the Huffington Post and I went on Twitter and they had bots, 20 to 1 attacking me, telling
[26:48.960 --> 26:54.360]  me I'm a loser, as our listenership and our support just explodes, and as everywhere I
[26:54.360 --> 26:59.000]  go, everybody wants to shake my hand, 99 people want to shake my hand for every libtard
[26:59.000 --> 27:03.800]  that runs over and gets in my face, so I am in just total panic mode, but you're right,
[27:03.800 --> 27:08.280]  you're winning, you're winning Hillary, you're winning Pelosi, you're winning Michael Moore,
[27:08.280 --> 27:13.800]  you're winning Maxine Waters, you're winning, winning, winning, just look, just, just, why?
[27:13.800 --> 27:21.640]  Look at Joe Scarborough, he just left the Republican Party, that's how fast it's collapsing,
[27:21.640 --> 27:25.720]  because if you were ever part of the Republican Party, you slime bag, psycho Joe, here she
[27:25.720 --> 27:26.720]  is.
[27:26.720 --> 27:31.480]  But the fact is, it doesn't matter who would vote for him, you have to be very positive
[27:31.480 --> 27:36.480]  about your own agenda, and that's what we're about right now, as we go forward with our,
[27:36.480 --> 27:41.880]  hopefully a successful attempt to win the Congress, same thing we did in 05 and 06, Republican
[27:41.880 --> 27:46.360]  president in the White House, Republican president in the White House, we're the voices, the
[27:46.360 --> 27:52.080]  Senate leader and I are the voices for winning those races in our House in this.
[27:52.080 --> 27:58.240]  I am the leader, that's right, several fighters have broken off from the main group, come with
[27:58.240 --> 28:05.880]  me and they're like, yes sir, Pelosi, get the crews to their fighters, but lord, they've,
[28:05.880 --> 28:10.200]  fighters are too small, they're avoiding our turbo lasers, we don't have to destroy them
[28:10.200 --> 28:14.800]  ship to ship, get Pelosi and Hillary to her fighters, ladies and gentlemen I'm quaking
[28:14.800 --> 28:18.280]  in my boots right now, you know, I ran out of time in the short segment, I'm going to
[28:18.280 --> 28:26.200]  come back and tell you what's coming up in about two hours with a good old Megan Kelly.
[28:26.200 --> 28:30.920]  So get ready for that, because the problem is we caught her doing so much deceptive editing,
[28:30.920 --> 28:35.960]  I mean it's beyond Katie Couric level stuff, I mean we've got me 20 minutes before saying
[28:35.960 --> 28:39.480]  one thing on a whole other subject, then I'm editing it in 20 minutes later into something
[28:39.480 --> 28:48.120]  completely different, we've got, we've got, I mean, oh boy, just let me tell you a little
[28:48.120 --> 28:51.160]  bit about it coming up the start of the next segment, because I want to get a little promo
[28:51.160 --> 28:55.440]  piece to put on Facebook and Twitter as well for people to tune in and just, and this is
[28:55.440 --> 29:00.840]  only like a five minute promo piece for what we're going to air, large chunks of the hours
[29:00.840 --> 29:08.120]  and hours we have next week, I mean this is going to be a college course on how they deceive
[29:08.120 --> 29:14.440]  people and also watching her crash and burn spectacularly, but very briefly, we have free
[29:14.440 --> 29:19.320]  shipping that I've extended to the month of July on everything at infowarstore.com, that
[29:19.320 --> 29:24.640]  is a big savings, especially on heavier items, and we have got secret 12 back in stock, our

[29:34.200 --> 29:38.520]  vitamin B12, you die, a lot of folks have very, very serious absorption problems in
[29:38.520 --> 29:42.160]  the gut, obviously, injections the best way, but this isn't for injection though, it's
[29:42.160 --> 29:46.200]  the same type, it's taken under the tongue for the second best way to get it into the
[29:46.200 --> 29:51.360]  bloodstream, sublingually, it's back in stock, secret 12, infowarstore.com.

[30:05.200 --> 30:06.960]  Are you aware of political fraud?
[30:06.960 --> 30:12.400]  It is rampant out there, here are some of its main exhibitors, Barack Obama.
[30:12.400 --> 30:16.040]  After running for president for the little guy, campaigning against big money, he got
[30:16.040 --> 30:20.600]  out of office and immediately became that which he campaigned against, Washington Fatcats,
[30:20.600 --> 30:24.480]  multi-million dollar book deals, multi-million dollar mansions, meanwhile, the little guy
[30:24.480 --> 30:28.080]  is looking for a new doctor or insurance plan they can afford, because of the healthcare

[30:38.800 --> 30:43.040]  George Clooney, a man who preaches open borders and tolerance, but could not tolerate the
[30:43.040 --> 30:47.520]  open borders of Europe, so move back to the United States, Bernie Sanders, the head commie
[30:47.520 --> 30:51.440]  who has been against millionaires and billionaires, that is accept himself with his multiple
[30:51.440 --> 30:55.440]  houses and cars, and with his wife, under investigation for bank fraud.
[30:55.440 --> 30:59.840]  Don't fall victim to political fraud, stay informed at infowars.com.
[30:59.840 --> 31:00.840]  This is Owen Troyer.
[31:00.840 --> 31:04.960]  It's not just our water we need to filter, it's not just our food that needs to be cleaned,
[31:04.960 --> 31:07.840]  it's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[31:07.840 --> 31:13.880]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[31:13.880 --> 31:18.840]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure Groundbreaking
[31:18.840 --> 31:23.760]  Water Filtration Systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze, whether it's your home

[31:28.640 --> 31:30.660]  job you can to purify your air.
[31:30.660 --> 31:35.680]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate
[31:35.680 --> 31:38.680]  or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[31:38.680 --> 31:40.880]  The general public doesn't.
[31:40.880 --> 31:44.840]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[31:44.840 --> 31:48.440]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[31:48.440 --> 31:52.000]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more
[31:52.000 --> 31:55.200]  expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.

[33:16.360 --> 33:36.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've got Roger Stone here, who just got sued by President Obama
[33:36.160 --> 33:38.920]  and George Soros yesterday.
[33:38.920 --> 33:45.280]  Also President Trump was also sued in the same publicity stunt disinformation piece.

[33:49.720 --> 33:54.440]  The Federal Elections Commission coming out saying, there's a criminal FBI investigation
[33:54.440 --> 34:01.280]  of myself for basically espionage, drugs report, Breitbart, totally made up, completely insane.
[34:01.280 --> 34:05.480]  They want congressional hearings on it, but of course it'll be secret, private hearings
[34:05.480 --> 34:10.160]  like Roger Stone's in next week, even in the days of Joe McCarthy, he was going after
[34:10.160 --> 34:16.920]  real communist agents, but still, it was in public, you had a chance to face your accuser,
[34:16.920 --> 34:21.640]  but they don't want that have you no decency moment when the Army's lawyer came in.
[34:21.640 --> 34:26.640]  So that's all coming up with Roger Stone here in just a few minutes, but first, coming
[34:26.640 --> 34:34.720]  up at 1.30 today in about two hours, I'm going to air the first excerpts of Megan Kelly's
[34:34.720 --> 34:41.720]  interview with me back in early June that aired on Father's Day and was the top story
[34:41.720 --> 34:44.680]  in the country for more than a week in the buildup.
[34:44.680 --> 34:50.840]  Her ratings since then have cratered from 10 million viewers, her first week, to 2 million
[34:50.840 --> 34:51.840]  now.
[34:51.840 --> 34:59.000]  In fact, even mainstream media is crediting us for destroying her, I want to be clear,
[34:59.000 --> 35:04.360]  she destroyed herself with her deception and with NBC's lies and the way they built it
[35:04.360 --> 35:09.120]  up that I was a devil incarnate, the public doesn't buy media hype anymore and turned
[35:09.120 --> 35:10.320]  away from it.
[35:10.320 --> 35:15.840]  And so the word is, Megan Kelly is looking for an exit strategy right now.
[35:15.840 --> 35:17.560]  She's poisoned.
[35:17.560 --> 35:19.840]  She's seen as an establishment hatchet woman.
[35:19.840 --> 35:24.480]  She barely survived going up against Trump, but her waterloo was going up against me.
[35:24.480 --> 35:27.920]  Here's the breaking news.
[35:27.920 --> 35:32.640]  We recorded some of the behind the scenes interview to protect ourselves because they
[35:32.640 --> 35:35.600]  were here more than 12 hours, but we recorded quite a bit of it.
[35:35.600 --> 35:39.240]  And you know, we knew that the classic thing is to take one topic and then ask you other
[35:39.240 --> 35:44.480]  questions about another topic and then to edit the pieces together to be deceptive.
[35:44.480 --> 35:47.320]  Katie Kirk and others have been sued over things like that.
[35:47.320 --> 35:52.800]  Megan Kelly and NBC clearly did that at a level I've never heard of.
[35:52.800 --> 35:59.120]  They edited stuff on totally different topics together to try to deceive the public about
[35:59.120 --> 36:00.320]  what I said.
[36:00.320 --> 36:05.720]  But still it was jump cuts and completely edited and even mainstream news admitted that
[36:05.720 --> 36:06.720]  it was jump cuts.
[36:06.720 --> 36:09.240]  And Sean Hannity said, you need to release the tape.
[36:09.240 --> 36:10.240]  This is clearly a deception.
[36:10.240 --> 36:14.280]  So you're going to get installment one today.
[36:14.280 --> 36:19.080]  That is only a taste of what's coming next week.
[36:19.080 --> 36:22.440]  Next week we're going to air large excerpts of what I really said.
[36:22.440 --> 36:28.000]  And then we're going to show you with the timeline and everything sometimes 30, 40 minutes
[36:28.000 --> 36:31.240]  apart on a whole nother subject.
[36:31.240 --> 36:36.920]  They would edit it together to create total fiction.
[36:36.920 --> 36:40.880]  I don't understand why they're so arrogant and why they thought they'd get a label disc
[36:40.880 --> 36:43.600]  because this was the trap the whole time.
[36:43.600 --> 36:45.200]  They thought we were walking into a trap.
[36:45.200 --> 36:49.680]  I knew they were going to make me look like hell, but that's not who I am.
[36:49.680 --> 36:52.920]  So I knew that the listeners and audience would understand that and quite frankly,
[36:52.920 --> 37:00.360]  I can't believe the explosion after this interview, it's now approaching listenership and viewership
[37:00.360 --> 37:01.800]  as big as the election.
[37:01.800 --> 37:07.140]  And folks, when I say we had 86 million people that listened or watched just on our sites
[37:07.140 --> 37:10.880]  and on our stations and on YouTube and Facebook, the week of the election, that's the number
[37:10.880 --> 37:12.560]  on our platforms.
[37:12.560 --> 37:16.960]  Not what we reached, not who saw just the front page that watched it or listened to
[37:16.960 --> 37:22.160]  it that actually clicked on media, audio and video and read articles.
[37:22.160 --> 37:27.880]  86 plus million, ladies and gentlemen, our normal high back then was 30 million or so.
[37:27.880 --> 37:30.680]  The new high was 40 something million after the election.
[37:30.680 --> 37:32.680]  We had a new plateau.
[37:32.680 --> 37:35.160]  It went down some, but a new high.
[37:35.160 --> 37:40.200]  We're already now climbing towards 55, 60 million every week since then and if the
[37:40.200 --> 37:45.400]  graph continues within three months, we'll be at 80 million people.
[37:45.400 --> 37:47.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's why they hate us.
[37:47.680 --> 37:49.360]  That's why they're coming after us.
[37:49.360 --> 37:50.600]  This is incredible.
[37:50.600 --> 37:56.280]  And I want to thank Megan Kelly and NBC for their arrogance, their bravada because it's
[37:56.280 --> 37:58.360]  spectacular and it blew up in their face.
[37:58.360 --> 38:03.280]  I am humble and I just ask God to lead God and direct me just like they were praying
[38:03.280 --> 38:06.280]  for Trump a few days ago at the White House and folks are making jokes about it.
[38:06.280 --> 38:07.280]  Hey, it's not funny.
[38:07.280 --> 38:09.520]  If I was in his position, I'd want those prayers as well.
[38:09.520 --> 38:10.600]  I need your prayers.
[38:10.600 --> 38:16.000]  This is hardcore, but coming up, Megan Kelly engaged in deception at levels I've never
[38:16.000 --> 38:17.000]  seen before.
[38:17.000 --> 38:19.600]  Roger Stone is here with us just briefly.
[38:19.600 --> 38:23.000]  We may have record audience, but I'm trying to hire a bunch of new crew, launch a bunch
[38:23.000 --> 38:24.000]  of new talk shows.
[38:24.000 --> 38:26.440]  Just the next month, you'll start seeing them be launched.
[38:26.440 --> 38:28.280]  We've been a few months behind, but it's happening now.
[38:28.280 --> 38:31.600]  David Knight starts August 20th.
[38:31.600 --> 38:34.840]  Roger Stone starts September 4th.
[38:34.840 --> 38:35.840]  So does Mike Cernovich.
[38:35.840 --> 38:37.040]  So does Owen Schreuer.
[38:37.040 --> 38:42.480]  This is all coming and more broadcasts, more transmissions, full TV slash radio productions,
[38:42.480 --> 38:44.280]  documentary films, all of it.
[38:44.280 --> 38:47.720]  We're going to have a hiatus for a few months on the nightly news because that's live and
[38:47.720 --> 38:51.040]  has so much production and so many pieces that we don't have the crew for that.
[38:51.040 --> 38:52.400]  That'll be a hiatus for a few months.
[38:52.400 --> 38:57.440]  I plan the new year to bring back the hour long live nightly news, but it's highly produced.
[38:57.440 --> 39:00.040]  A lot of, I mean, it takes like 10 people to run it.
[39:00.040 --> 39:02.960]  So that's going to have a hiatus, but we're going to launch a bunch of new talk shows
[39:02.960 --> 39:06.920]  that are going to stream and dominant on the web, be syndicated to radio or in contact
[39:06.920 --> 39:07.920]  with all the affiliates.
[39:07.920 --> 39:12.760]  Very, very exciting things happening on that front, but we need your financial support.
[39:12.760 --> 39:17.720]  Yes, revenue has gone up a little bit from last year, despite the censorship, Google
[39:17.720 --> 39:22.800]  banning us, what happened with Adroll, all of it.
[39:22.800 --> 39:26.960]  But we've clawed back the funding we needed, but we need more to be strong.
[39:26.960 --> 39:28.960]  The enemy attacks the fact that we're funded.
[39:28.960 --> 39:33.120]  They attack the fact that we sell high quality products because they know they're good products
[39:33.120 --> 39:38.880]  from water filters and non-GMO heirloom seeds to books and films and T-shirts and all sorts
[39:38.880 --> 39:42.040]  of great stuff to be part of the Liberty community and support this broadcast.
[39:42.040 --> 39:46.320]  And we have pre-shipping throughout the month of July, secret 12, the great high quality
[39:46.320 --> 39:53.200]  organic, methylcobalamin that you take under your tongue, highest quality, organic, vegan
[39:53.200 --> 39:54.200]  derived.
[39:54.200 --> 39:57.160]  It is back in stock after being sold out for three months.

[40:02.280 --> 40:06.640]  off survival shield X2, 30% off gut health support pack.

[40:10.760 --> 40:12.640]  probiotic, 30% off.
[40:12.640 --> 40:16.160]  That is so key, folks, check that out.

[40:23.400 --> 40:28.600]  Super blue fluoride free toothpaste is also back in stock with Loyal Silver and iodine.
[40:28.600 --> 40:29.600]  Super blue.
[40:29.600 --> 40:30.600]  Impholwarslife.com.
[40:30.600 --> 40:33.160]  But you want people to fight the globalist?
[40:33.160 --> 40:34.320]  We don't get Soros money.
[40:34.320 --> 40:35.600]  We don't get globalist money.
[40:35.600 --> 40:37.400]  We don't get big corporate sponsorship.
[40:37.400 --> 40:42.840]  We're sponsored by you, not Soros, not the Russians, not the Kebler elves, not the Easter
[40:42.840 --> 40:43.840]  Bunny.
[40:43.840 --> 40:47.880]  And we've got them coming after us on every front because we are effective.
[40:47.880 --> 40:52.240]  So again, whether it's a bottle of Loyal Silver or whether it is the Myco ZX or whether it's

[41:09.720 --> 41:10.720]  And it's not the nano.
[41:10.720 --> 41:12.600]  It is not the nano zinc.
[41:12.600 --> 41:13.600]  So it's not toxic.
[41:13.600 --> 41:15.600]  Again, infolwarslife.com.
[41:15.600 --> 41:23.880]  Now, joining us in studio is Roger Stone, sued by Obama, sued by George Soros.
[41:23.880 --> 41:27.800]  Even the political admits this group was found by Obama to go after Trump.
[41:27.800 --> 41:29.080]  It's Obama.
[41:29.080 --> 41:30.080]  It's incredible.
[41:30.080 --> 41:31.080]  I've got political right here.
[41:31.080 --> 41:33.800]  We'll show that for TV viewers on screen.
[41:33.800 --> 41:36.440]  We've got a federal judge that's involved in this suit.
[41:36.440 --> 41:41.560]  They just state, as fact, even the New York Times last night said, the suit has no evidence.
[41:41.560 --> 41:46.480]  I've never seen anything this crazy, but it's a PR stunt.
[41:46.480 --> 41:50.120]  It is clearly, in fact, pull up the New York Times, so just type in Roger Stone, sued.
[41:50.120 --> 41:54.760]  Even the New York Times second paragraph admits there's no proof, but that it's just a fishing
[41:54.760 --> 41:56.680]  expedition and a total stunt.
[41:56.680 --> 42:02.520]  Absolutely scroll down right there and it says there is no evidence in the complaint
[42:02.520 --> 42:10.440]  it reads like Pulp Fiction, and from a 1960s comic book, this is just wild.
[42:10.440 --> 42:11.440]  Keep scrolling down.
[42:11.440 --> 42:16.360]  It says right there in the article that, again, there is no evidence, but that they want to
[42:16.360 --> 42:19.760]  be able to subpoena and drag people from the mud.
[42:19.760 --> 42:22.040]  This is simply incredible.
[42:22.040 --> 42:25.720]  Mr. Trump and his political advisors, including Mr. Stone, have repeatedly denied, including
[42:25.720 --> 42:26.720]  with Russia.
[42:26.720 --> 42:30.360]  And the 44-page complaint filed on Wednesday in the federal district court of the District
[42:30.360 --> 42:34.640]  of Columbia does not contain any hard evidence that his campaign did.
[42:34.640 --> 42:38.520]  Wow, the New York Times, broken clocks are right twice a day.
[42:38.520 --> 42:39.520]  It's beyond no evidence.
[42:39.520 --> 42:42.440]  It just says he is a Russian agent.
[42:42.440 --> 42:43.640]  Trump is a Russian agent.
[42:43.640 --> 42:46.320]  The Russians won the election.
[42:46.320 --> 42:49.760]  When even Forbes said yesterday, Russia Gate is Hillary Gate.
[42:49.760 --> 42:51.440]  It's all on them.
[42:51.440 --> 42:56.120]  And now we know McCain's been caught sending people to meet with Russia, meet with England,
[42:56.120 --> 42:58.640]  meet with foreign leaders, trying to find dirt.
[42:58.640 --> 43:02.040]  Because meeting with Russians makes you colluding with Russians, then McCain and Hillary are
[43:02.040 --> 43:03.160]  the ones that are guilty.
[43:03.160 --> 43:04.160]  Roger Stone.
[43:04.160 --> 43:07.680]  Well, Alex, here is breaking news.
[43:07.680 --> 43:14.400]  I was informed, literally minutes before walking on the set, that my testimony before the House
[43:14.400 --> 43:20.760]  Select Committee on Intelligence, which has now been scheduled for several months on July
[43:20.760 --> 43:29.120]  24th, is being indefinitely postponed till sometime after the congressional recess.
[43:29.120 --> 43:30.120]  Wow.
[43:30.120 --> 43:33.040]  They won't even give us a post-recess date.
[43:33.040 --> 43:37.400]  They're saying, perhaps in September, perhaps.
[43:37.400 --> 43:41.240]  This is, justice delayed is justice denied.
[43:41.240 --> 43:48.520]  All of these hapless Democrat simps on the committee had no trouble in a public session
[43:48.520 --> 43:55.760]  defaming me, accusing me of being a traitor to my country, accusing me of being in contact
[43:55.760 --> 44:02.040]  and orchestrating the WikiLeaks disclosures, a complete lie.
[44:02.040 --> 44:05.520]  But they will not give me my day in court.
[44:05.520 --> 44:08.520]  They will not give me my public opportunity.
[44:08.520 --> 44:12.560]  I am outraged by this decision.
[44:12.560 --> 44:20.160]  The excuse they give us is that they don't have all the documents necessary for the session.
[44:20.160 --> 44:23.040]  There are no documents to have.
[44:23.040 --> 44:30.960]  There is no evidence whatsoever that I had advanced knowledge of the hacking of the Democratic
[44:30.960 --> 44:34.640]  National Committee if it was even hacked.
[44:34.640 --> 44:37.280]  They can't even prove that.
[44:37.280 --> 44:44.680]  The legal complaint put forward by a bunch of Democrat pig ambulance chasers who seek
[44:44.680 --> 44:51.240]  to do in the courts what they could not do at the ballot box is merely a pasted together
[44:51.240 --> 44:56.280]  compendium of unsubstantiated media claims.
[44:56.280 --> 45:00.800]  Stone was involved in hacking the DNC emails.
[45:00.800 --> 45:02.840]  It is a fraud upon the court.
[45:02.840 --> 45:10.280]  And every one of these lawyers who is involved in this is perpetrating a fraud upon the court.
[45:10.280 --> 45:15.280]  I have no choice but to move for dismissal.
[45:15.280 --> 45:20.680]  But then I will be asking for disciplinary action against every one of these lawyers.
[45:20.680 --> 45:23.040]  I don't care if you're a federal judge.
[45:23.040 --> 45:25.880]  You too must be chastised by the court.
[45:25.880 --> 45:31.920]  What shocks me, Alex, is that any lawyer worth his or her salt would put their name on this
[45:31.920 --> 45:32.920]  piece of crap.
[45:32.920 --> 45:35.120]  It is that poorly craft.
[45:35.120 --> 45:39.800]  It's over the top defamation meant to be regurgitated all around the media.
[45:39.800 --> 45:41.960]  And again, it's Obama that have intently set this group up.
[45:41.960 --> 45:45.160]  It's Obama suing you and now we know it's a smokescreen.
[45:45.160 --> 45:48.760]  For them first thing, you're going to have to testify in secret.
[45:48.760 --> 45:52.080]  But you're allowed to have a five minute statement that's public.
[45:52.080 --> 45:57.240]  And then now they're completely chickening out again because they do not want you to
[45:57.240 --> 46:00.120]  be able to actually stand up and be the real Roger Stone.
[46:00.120 --> 46:03.400]  They want to create this facsimile, this straw man.
[46:03.400 --> 46:09.240]  Just like they say they want me to testify before Congress, the Federal Elections Commission,
[46:09.240 --> 46:14.840]  and they just stayed in that complaint that we're all Russian agents and that Drudge is.
[46:14.840 --> 46:16.760]  I mean, Drudge just links to news articles.
[46:16.760 --> 46:19.000]  These people are out of their minds.
[46:19.000 --> 46:28.680]  Well, and ironically, the point of this bogus lawsuit is that WikiLeaks has somehow endangered
[46:28.680 --> 46:35.440]  the safety and invaded the privacy of three Democratic National Committee donors.
[46:35.440 --> 46:37.840]  Meanwhile, they put your home address on the.
[46:37.840 --> 46:42.480]  They put my home address in the caption of lawsuit, which is unheard of in legal circles,
[46:42.480 --> 46:47.320]  an attempt to threaten and foment violence against my family.
[46:47.320 --> 46:49.440]  It is just an outrage.
[46:49.440 --> 46:51.760]  But they've picked a fight with the wrong guy.
[46:51.760 --> 46:53.160]  Alex, they want to fight.
[46:53.160 --> 46:54.160]  Let's fight.
[46:54.160 --> 46:56.680]  I will be filing a countersuit.
[46:56.680 --> 46:58.880]  They're suing me for 75,000.
[46:58.880 --> 47:04.160]  I will be suing them for 75 million in basin.
[47:04.160 --> 47:08.440]  This man needs to be disbarred and when I am finished, he will be.
[47:08.440 --> 47:09.440]  You want to fight?
[47:09.440 --> 47:10.440]  Let's fight.
[47:10.440 --> 47:11.440]  You lost in the ballot box.
[47:11.440 --> 47:13.120]  You can't defeat Donald Trump.
[47:13.120 --> 47:14.960]  Your lawsuit is bogus.
[47:14.960 --> 47:15.960]  It's phony.
[47:15.960 --> 47:16.960]  It's a fraud.
[47:16.960 --> 47:18.720]  It is without merit.
[47:18.720 --> 47:25.360]  It's malicious and it makes allegations that are entirely false.
[47:25.360 --> 47:27.160]  It's completely irresponsible.
[47:27.160 --> 47:32.520]  Well, clearly, baritry needs to be investigated because I don't know if these poor clients
[47:32.520 --> 47:34.600]  know what they've been signed on to.
[47:34.600 --> 47:38.840]  They've now been made parties to this manifest fraud.
[47:38.840 --> 47:42.120]  I mean, this is another sign of complete desperation.
[47:42.120 --> 47:46.440]  Now we know McCain was reaching out to Russians, sending out having meetings.
[47:46.440 --> 47:49.240]  They've done what they claim Donnie Jr. did.
[47:49.240 --> 47:51.920]  I mean, this is just unraveling so fast.
[47:51.920 --> 47:58.200]  Well, it's leaving me no choice but to form a legal defense fund, not that I need a defense,
[47:58.200 --> 48:04.080]  but an offensive move to file disciplinary actions with the bar associations for a half
[48:04.080 --> 48:11.240]  dozen lawyers in different states to file a counter lawsuit for defamation and so on.
[48:11.240 --> 48:13.080]  This is enormously expensive.
[48:13.080 --> 48:16.000]  And I want to be clear to the audience, you want a war.
[48:16.000 --> 48:17.480]  You want us to take America back.
[48:17.480 --> 48:18.480]  You want taxes cut.
[48:18.480 --> 48:22.480]  You want the border secured, you want the vets taken care of.
[48:22.480 --> 48:24.720]  You want radical Islamists is not allowed to come into the country.
[48:24.720 --> 48:29.320]  You want the Second Amendment secured, the right of religion secured, and I'm not complaining
[48:29.320 --> 48:30.400]  and I'm not bragging.
[48:30.400 --> 48:31.400]  We're doing it.
[48:31.400 --> 48:35.880]  We are point blank, front lines, and we're winning that we're under heavy fire.
[48:35.880 --> 48:39.360]  We are taking hits, but we're hitting them 10 times harder.
[48:39.360 --> 48:41.280]  They've just got a larger force.
[48:41.280 --> 48:42.440]  They've got more money.
[48:42.440 --> 48:43.600]  You are the resistance.
[48:43.600 --> 48:47.720]  Your prayers, your financial support when you buy products and info are store.com.
[48:47.720 --> 48:50.760]  You go to Stone Cold Truth.com and buy his t-shirts or whatever.
[48:50.760 --> 48:52.840]  The point is, is that this is a war.
[48:52.840 --> 48:56.680]  They're coming after us and we need support, so when you get that set up, Roger, I'll definitely
[48:56.680 --> 48:57.680]  help you out with that.
[48:57.680 --> 49:04.720]  Now, expanding here, what do you make then of them launching this suit directed by the
[49:04.720 --> 49:08.640]  president with the group that even Politico admits he set up?
[49:08.640 --> 49:14.200]  That clearly ties the president in now, and I think he is really who you need to now move
[49:14.200 --> 49:19.280]  against because he doesn't have immunity when he engages in bullying and criminal activity.
[49:19.280 --> 49:24.680]  Even if he tries to operate through these adjuncts because he admitted at the onset,
[49:24.680 --> 49:30.560]  he established this group to sabotage the electoral process and to block the seeding
[49:30.560 --> 49:33.040]  of Trump and the ongoing operations of Trump.
[49:33.040 --> 49:38.160]  Well, Alex, as you have pointed out many times, from the beginning of this campaign, they
[49:38.160 --> 49:41.840]  have often attacked us for exactly what they are doing.
[49:41.840 --> 49:48.880]  It's a very Alinsky-type tactic, so the committee to protect democracy is in fact a committee
[49:48.880 --> 49:51.480]  to subvert democracy.
[49:51.480 --> 49:54.680]  They cannot accept the verdict of the people.
[49:54.680 --> 49:59.280]  They can't accept the fact that Donald Trump trounced Hillary Clinton in an election in
[49:59.280 --> 50:01.800]  which she spent $2 billion.
[50:01.800 --> 50:04.360]  Trump spent $275 million.
[50:04.360 --> 50:06.520]  They had the mainstream media rigged.
[50:06.520 --> 50:12.040]  They had the new media rigged, Google, Facebook, Twitter, manipulating the algorithm.
[50:12.040 --> 50:13.040]  They had the Vatican.
[50:13.040 --> 50:14.040]  They had the EU.
[50:14.040 --> 50:15.040]  They had the Chycoms.
[50:15.040 --> 50:18.120]  They had the Saudi Arabians all against them, Hollywood, the media.
[50:18.120 --> 50:19.120]  We beat them.
[50:19.120 --> 50:22.160]  It's the whole fake campaign system, the whole fake media is scared.
[50:22.160 --> 50:26.760]  They're obsolete, so they've got to prove they can still destroy our movement or they're
[50:26.760 --> 50:27.960]  not going to get donor money.
[50:27.960 --> 50:30.040]  They're not going to get corporate funding, which is happening.
[50:30.040 --> 50:32.760]  Add revenues down to them.
[50:32.760 --> 50:37.560]  The support of the Democratic donations are at all time lows.
[50:37.560 --> 50:38.720]  They're dying.
[50:38.720 --> 50:39.720]  They're failing, correct?
[50:39.720 --> 50:40.720]  Absolutely.
[50:40.720 --> 50:44.800]  A high-level Democratic consultant who just happens to be a friend of mine told me two
[50:44.800 --> 50:45.960]  things this morning.
[50:45.960 --> 50:49.400]  First of all, he said, this is a pure publicity play.
[50:49.400 --> 50:54.040]  They want the sizzle of your name in the wake of the Netflix documentary.
[50:54.040 --> 50:55.040]  To raise money.
[50:55.040 --> 50:56.040]  I just don't.
[50:56.040 --> 50:57.040]  To raise money.
[50:57.040 --> 50:58.040]  They're just vampires.
[50:58.040 --> 50:59.040]  They can't get any blood.
[50:59.040 --> 51:00.040]  They're desperate.
[51:00.040 --> 51:01.040]  We'll be right back.
[51:01.040 --> 51:04.960]  If food became scarce, would you be able to feed yourself and your family?
[51:04.960 --> 51:09.720]  Have you found some emergency food supplies can cost upwards of $300 for a month's supply?
[51:09.720 --> 51:13.760]  And worst of all, they're packed with chemicals and other unpronounceable ingredients.

[53:56.280 --> 54:12.960]  All right, Roger Stone's riding shot done with us into the next hour, Jack Pasobic, great
[54:12.960 --> 54:14.680]  political activist, is going to be popping in.
[54:14.680 --> 54:18.120]  We're going to take your phone calls at the bottom of the next hour as well, ton of news
[54:18.120 --> 54:20.000]  to cover, and go over.
[54:20.000 --> 54:26.120]  By the way, we had over 8,000 memes sent in, some of them still images, thousands of them
[54:26.120 --> 54:31.440]  videos, and I've got a, again, limited crew, we're trying to hire more videographers, more
[54:31.440 --> 54:36.240]  crew to go through all this, to post it to M-Full Wars, to post it to Twitter and Facebook.
[54:36.240 --> 54:43.160]  We've got weeks of memes just to even be able to post the best ones to M-FullWars.com and
[54:43.160 --> 54:44.440]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[54:44.440 --> 54:47.640]  But all of you that made memes are winners in the fight for liberty.
[54:47.640 --> 54:50.880]  In fact, you're such an activist, I've got your emails, I'm going to start contacting
[54:50.880 --> 54:56.280]  you with ideas and see who wants to be auxiliary reporters or who wants to be eyes and ears
[54:56.280 --> 54:57.280]  on the ground.
[54:57.280 --> 55:01.160]  But we're trying to grow our operation here to just get the base crew we need to really
[55:01.160 --> 55:05.400]  be able to even respond to the over-the-top success, because I've had other contests
[55:05.400 --> 55:08.420]  with maybe 1,000 people entering when you've got a month.
[55:08.420 --> 55:14.080]  This is like 8 plus thousand when I checked yesterday, and I've got Paul Watson, Michael
[55:14.080 --> 55:18.520]  Zerm and others just trying for hours to go over all these.
[55:18.520 --> 55:23.880]  It's incredible, absolutely incredible what our listeners have made, what you've done.
[55:23.880 --> 55:27.920]  Some of these memes have millions and millions of views, a piece, most of them tens of thousands
[55:27.920 --> 55:32.920]  if not hundreds of thousands, show great job, this is having a huge effect, we want to commend
[55:32.920 --> 55:35.480]  all of you for what you've done.
[55:35.480 --> 55:40.680]  The one where Bugs Bunny's controlling the director at a symphony, that's one you made,
[55:40.680 --> 55:47.600]  the RoboCop, the stuff with the Indiana Jones, those all have millions and millions of views.
[55:47.600 --> 55:51.920]  And it really is amazing, and that's just some of the memes that our listeners have
[55:51.920 --> 55:52.920]  made.
[55:52.920 --> 55:56.280]  There's countless others that others have made, it shows the power of the people expressing
[55:56.280 --> 55:57.280]  themselves.
[55:57.280 --> 56:00.680]  The left wants to ban right on the street with chalk or having free speech, we're just
[56:00.680 --> 56:03.880]  going to respond to their political correctness now more than ever.
[56:03.880 --> 56:06.120]  They wanted to shut Trump down, it didn't work.
[56:06.120 --> 56:12.240]  So again, we'll be announcing sometime next week Paul will $20,000 prize whoever he says
[56:12.240 --> 56:15.560]  did the best meme, but we've got to go over all of them and then we've got to try to get
[56:15.560 --> 56:19.160]  them all out to the public to deploy them, so if you've made one of these memes, post
[56:19.160 --> 56:23.800]  it on Facebook and Twitter yourself, please don't just email it to us, because we've kind
[56:23.800 --> 56:27.320]  of got a log jam trying to post these to the internet, the rather link to you and your
[56:27.320 --> 56:32.520]  own YouTube, your own Facebook, continuing here Roger, I'm going to get more into what's
[56:32.520 --> 56:36.960]  happened to you and happened to others, but looking at the waterfront, and Gorka talked
[56:36.960 --> 56:41.160]  about this on CNN from the White House, they really are collapsing, they keep trying to
[56:41.160 --> 56:44.760]  tell us we're collapsing, all the metrics show the opposite, look at Megyn Kelly, we're
[56:44.760 --> 56:49.560]  going to premiere some of the behind the scenes stuff coming out in the third hour today.
[56:49.560 --> 56:53.760]  She was so arrogant, she is literally, this is the biggest plunge from 10 million viewers
[56:53.760 --> 56:59.320]  to 2 million in a month and a half, they admit that she came to Info Wars and bled out.
[56:59.320 --> 57:02.320]  I didn't even do a very good job, it's that she's reviled.
[57:02.320 --> 57:07.120]  Well, and the bean counters at her new network have got to be upset because they're paying
[57:07.120 --> 57:13.040]  her mega millions, and of course now they can't charge top rate for the commercial slots
[57:13.040 --> 57:20.320]  in her show, because nobody's watching, I mean reruns of the Brady Bunch are outpacing
[57:20.320 --> 57:29.560]  her literally, it's an appropriate fall for someone who knifed Roger Ailes, who I think
[57:29.560 --> 57:35.720]  was largely responsible for the rise of her career, she knifed him when he was ill and
[57:35.720 --> 57:36.720]  could no longer-
[57:36.720 --> 57:40.080]  First she said he never did anything, one time he hugged her at a Christmas party a little
[57:40.080 --> 57:41.080]  too long.
[57:41.080 --> 57:46.040]  But then she got an 11 million dollar book contract from the Murdoch Brothers, and she
[57:46.040 --> 57:53.200]  hyped up her testimony against a real patriot, Roger Ailes, all of the claims against him
[57:53.200 --> 58:01.080]  are unproven, they are allegations, nothing less, and this is disgraceful in my view
[58:01.080 --> 58:07.560]  that you would knife somebody who had helped your career that substantially, shows you
[58:07.560 --> 58:12.880]  what kind of person she really is, well it's been reported the tabloids that she left her
[58:12.880 --> 58:16.240]  sister homeless, and that there's all sorts of crimes that have been committed in her
[58:16.240 --> 58:22.400]  family, it's just like grifters or something, well and my friends at Fox and I have many
[58:22.400 --> 58:28.200]  at the highest levels tell me that she was widely reviled there for her abusive nature,
[58:28.200 --> 58:33.080]  she was not popular within the film, unfortunately if you come from Trash you rarely escape,
[58:33.080 --> 58:37.960]  and I feel sorry for what we're going to have to do to her today, it's bad, just it's real
[58:37.960 --> 58:41.480]  bad, we'll be right back.
[58:41.480 --> 58:52.600]  You are listening to GCN, visit GCNLive.com today.

[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:51.880]  president I think is making a great impression around the world the president's winning it's a
[01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:57.600]  new day it's a new day and now we have a president who will not draw a line in the sand and sit back
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:03.040]  and watch our adversaries cross it and do nothing you've got a president who won't stand up for
[01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:09.600]  America and the globalists hate it the mainstream media hates it they want an obsequious weak
[01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:15.320]  American president who will bow to George Soros and globalism didn't you love how they were all
[01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:19.400]  wearing including Putin's G20 pens but Trump Woodney was wearing the American flag that says
[01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:25.400]  I'm not in your group I represent America I'm not gonna be co-opted look he's an unabashed
[01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:32.920]  American patriot who will always put America first he doesn't need this job and the media ran
[01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:37.800]  shots of him at the table alone drinking water not hobnobbing with everybody because you know
[01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:41.560]  they hadn't agreed with what he said so he said fine I'm done talking to you there's no point
[01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:45.760]  let's have a press conference let's get out of here I did my job I stood up for America they
[01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:51.080]  showed the first lady of Poland walk by to shake Melania's hand they cut it to not show her shake
[01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:56.040]  his hand it's all like third grade you're not in the cool club yeah I mean even my young
[01:02:56.040 --> 01:03:00.720]  daughters know now when kids are mean to them or whatever or jealous oh your dad's famous that
[01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:05.440]  they're insecure and my daughters laugh at them and know it's a joke and they're young girls why
[01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:10.240]  does it the liberal media get we don't want to be in their cool club Trump doesn't either you
[01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:18.120]  people are scum yeah no it's it's it's childish going back to the trip to Paris the the various
[01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:23.880]  world leaders the European leaders there handled the president the worst possible way rolling their
[01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:29.480]  eyes looking at each other furtively that was at the first meeting of a month ago now they've
[01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:34.720]  learned it doesn't work well it was the exact now the ass kicking as big kissing as big exactly
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:40.240]  and what they're gonna find is that that won't work either if their goal is to get Donald Trump to
[01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:45.640]  take an action that is not in the best interests of the United States he doesn't care he doesn't
[01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:50.120]  care what they say about him he doesn't care what they think what they think about him what he
[01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:56.240]  cares is about what's best for the United States it's refreshing in my opinion very refreshing you
[01:03:56.240 --> 01:04:00.480]  know this is so seminal what you said is so important if you understand this you understand
[01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:05.840]  everything the childish immature manipulation the arrested development how the corporate media and
[01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:13.440]  Hollywood themselves are the most childish peacock corrupt entitled idiots and everyone sees that
[01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:21.320]  dripping through the facade now and so we should come back and show how she did shake his hand how
[01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:26.240]  the media lied and said that she didn't they're the same thing in Israel they say no one wants
[01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:31.080]  him he's being shunned but now that it's so obvious that it's the opposite they're fawning and
[01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:37.120]  groveling because they see real leadership and because the shunning didn't work now MPR as you
[01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:44.200]  said is flipping out saying oh my gosh this is horrible he's popular our facade's falling everything's
[01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:48.840]  imploding what are we gonna do well the answer is lie even more that's what they've been doing
[01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:53.480]  which is the definition of insanity doing the same thing over and over again believing you're
[01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:58.520]  gonna get a different response the man sued by President Obama yesterday Roger Stone straight
[01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:05.720]  ahead here's the truth about the Don Jr. emails there's nothing there but considering the seriousness
[01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:09.440]  in the response from the liberal media and Democrats the thinking person must wonder why
[01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:13.480]  there was no such outrage when Hillary Clinton illegally had classified emails on a private
[01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:18.680]  server then deleted 33,000 emails then smashed her old phone with a hammer but what about Natalia
[01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:23.520]  Veselnickaya Don Jr. didn't know he was meeting her either her or Rob Goldstone lied about the
[01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:27.520]  premise of the meeting and if he had known her name prior to the meeting Don Jr. would have known
[01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:32.160]  she had Obama fingerprints all over her she was potentially in the country illegally only in
[01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:35.920]  the country temporarily thanks to Obama's Department of Justice however that state had
[01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:40.200]  expired previous to her meeting Don Jr. eight days after the meeting she was sitting next to
[01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:45.240]  Obama's Russian ambassador during a foreign affairs committee hearing so Tim Kane is Obama's
[01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:50.040]  DOJ guilty of treason who knew she was here illegally and why no investigation into that
[01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:56.080]  Veselnickaya's alleged law firm in Russia has no website no working phone and no email for

[01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:47.800]  of divide and conquer showing the seeds of racism classism sexism claiming they're gonna fix it
[01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:52.440]  but making it worse bringing in incompatible radical Islam rolling out the red carpet to

[01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:38.520]  john trump now there's a lot of news articles out there saying jones used to be anti-establishment
[01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:43.680]  but now he's pro-establishment no i'm not if the establishment is foreign banks running
[01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:49.400]  our country and being tax exempt and dumbing our population down and having regulations
[01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:53.440]  and high taxes to make us poor i'm against that establishment if the establishment is
[01:09:53.440 --> 01:10:01.000]  free market small government open free society second amendment red white and blue fair trade
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:07.880]  deals yes i am establishment americana you bet i'm establishment americana i'm a classical
[01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:12.480]  constitutionalist libertarian left right these modern terms mean nothing the left are a bunch
[01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:17.160]  of authoritarians the right wing at the top are a bunch of republican control arms that
[01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:22.680]  wrote obama carries a giant screw job i want america back if you want to live in venezuela
[01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:27.160]  or cuba or north korea if you want to live under communism go there there's plenty of
[01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:32.320]  hell holes like that but they all keep saying jones is establishment now no we have a beach
[01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:37.560]  head in washington our president is under siege we are taking back the states we do have
[01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:42.080]  the trifecta but they got the trifecta of the corporate media the big mega money and
[01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:47.160]  the republican establishment the democrats with polosi going we're winners we're going
[01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:51.040]  to beat george w bush we're winners that's a quote i played last hour we'll play to
[01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:57.920]  get in a minute that is illustrative of how they're just over the mountain i mean they're
[01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:04.360]  out the pasture they're in clout cuckoo land the problem is little blue eyed devil little
[01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:11.200]  mr. psycho heading up the house representatives paul ryan smart he's establishment and he's
[01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:17.080]  sabotaging trump's tax cuts he's sabotaging just repeal obama care like trump said don't
[01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:23.120]  blame him for the bad republican versions just just you know get in there and repeal
[01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:27.160]  it because what we had before was better than this and we have elizabeth warren and we have
[01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:31.240]  a zeke lamanual admitting they want to wreck the old health care system that was the best
[01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:35.960]  in the world so i want to go to jack posseau but to see what's front and center on his
[01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:40.520]  radar in dc you were just with him a few nights ago to a packed house of patriots and some
[01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:45.320]  of the breaking stuff they're investigating but you hit on something roger stone i want
[01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:51.480]  to get to a little bit later in the interview the fact that the left is so childish now
[01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:55.840]  and it's all like oh you're not cool oh you're not in the cool crowd oh you're you're not
[01:11:55.840 --> 01:12:00.960]  the hollywood red carpets no one i know unless they're like a 14 year old moron wants to be
[01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:05.160]  in hollywood or red carpets we're getting back to americanism that the historian alexander
[01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:09.560]  detochable wrote about where in america it was all about what you built what you did
[01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:14.880]  what you stood for not who your daddy was and we're getting back to what made us great
[01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:21.080]  and america's instincts are coming back and you see them trying to go trump's being sued
[01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:26.560]  or trump's a loser nobody wants to shake trump's hand as they fawn in france as they fawn
[01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:31.960]  in germany as they fawn in poland as they fawn in india as they fawn in saudi arabia
[01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:38.080]  everybody can see the return of america and everybody is in awe and they went from trying
[01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:45.040]  to shun trump when he was in europe a month ago to absolutely recognizing the fact that
[01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:49.520]  this is leadership and you may disagree with a few things trough's doing but he's real
[01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:55.040]  and he's scaring the establishment but first you're being sued by obama here's politica
[01:12:55.040 --> 01:13:00.840]  they admit right here obama lawyers team up to fight trump sue roger stone the hill politica
[01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:05.240]  they said six months ago they were going to do this february 23rd they've done it so it's
[01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:10.520]  an accurate statement to say obama and soros funds it that's associated press is suing
[01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:14.480]  you and president trump even the new york times finally got it right though in the article
[01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:20.600]  trump campaign is sued over leaked emails leaked to russians and it says no evidence
[01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:27.840]  it is literally more fiction than a superman or spider-man comic the the time specifically
[01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:34.240]  says the lawsuit does not contain any hard evidence that the trump campaign in fact
[01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:42.440]  hacked the wiki mail wiki leaks emails incorrect in the story is the fact that the complaint
[01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:48.160]  largely consists of a catalog log of publicly known facts that it presents as circumstantial
[01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:54.800]  evidence no actually it contains a number of publicly known assertions claims i dispute
[01:13:54.800 --> 01:14:01.000]  that these are facts when the intelligence agency say they're highly confident than
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:06.640]  the that the russians sought to interfere in our election that's an assertion that's
[01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:11.840]  a claim that's not a fact prove that i challenge you to prove it i dare you to prove it and
[01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:17.000]  the other big news tell them what you just learned an hour ago well my testimony before
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:22.880]  the house intelligence committee which was scheduled for the 24th in which they had agreed
[01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:29.600]  to allow me to make a public statement which i planned like james comey to release in advance
[01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:35.360]  and that was willing therefore to testify in private has been indefinitely postponed
[01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:43.720]  to quote sometime after the congressional research why don't we hold a mock deal on
[01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:47.320]  the same day here where i just make public statements they've already made and then
[01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:51.880]  you get to read your statement under the record and respond i mean because they never let
[01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:55.320]  you have your day in court they just keep lying about you they're scared why not have
[01:14:55.320 --> 01:15:00.920]  just a mock hearing well and jack was putting together a demonstration a rally in washington
[01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:05.840]  we're gonna have to put that on hold you know i'm incensed about this i think you should
[01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:10.240]  still have it in demand you have your day in court well we're gonna look at all of the
[01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:15.600]  options right now of course i'm tied up with trying to put together a counter suit against
[01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:23.640]  the democrat pig ambulance chaser lawyers who have filed this totally bogus former obama
[01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:30.160]  council against the president his campaign and myself i hope to get that underway here
[01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:36.640]  in the next 48 hours and then i'll deal with this as i said earlier justice delayed is
[01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:40.320]  justice denied but here's the bottom line our listeners are not spectators we need you
[01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:44.480]  to spread the articles spread the videos they have bots blocking us they admit they're trying
[01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:48.760]  to censor us google admits they have contracts out trying to block us facebook twitter but
[01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:53.360]  they can't stop you human action they're scared of what's at info wars they're scared of the
[01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:57.840]  guess we have on their scared of the articles they're scared of the videos this latest on
[01:15:57.840 --> 01:16:02.240]  google is bombshell that we're gonna get to that later in the hour i want to go to jack
[01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:07.200]  possobeck jack thank you so much for joining us you've heard a lot of the points we've
[01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:11.840]  made i've got a lot of questions but but but what's front and center for you there in
[01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:17.520]  dc and then i've got some questions dealing with the hysteria that they think they've
[01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:21.760]  got on donnie jr as it comes out that mccain actually went and sent people to meet with
[01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:28.080]  russians to get dirt so by that yardstick mccain's done far more than donnie jr exactly
[01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:31.200]  thanks so much for having me on alex thanks so much for having me on roger it was great
[01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:35.680]  to see you the other name where we completely barnstormed the uh the washington dc establishment
[01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:41.720]  at the republican club alex one thing that's been hot and and and heavy for us is that
[01:16:41.720 --> 01:16:47.640]  our sources on the hill and our sources within the trump administration and i'm sure you're
[01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:52.480]  hearing the same from yours they are under constant scrutiny there is a witch hunt right
[01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:58.280]  now they're saying who's talking to jack possobeck who's talking to alex jones who's talking
[01:16:58.280 --> 01:17:03.000]  to roger stone and they are trying everything they can to do to stop the sources from getting
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:07.680]  out to us let's be clear that's not trump that's retweeting you now that's not trump
[01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:13.560]  that's deep state yeah there's no there's no question is out of uh get into more of
[01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:20.080]  that yeah so i mean i will schedule meetings for people i'll say hey let's go to this regular
[01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:23.960]  spot where we usually go and sit and it's um you know well off the beaten trail you
[01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:27.800]  know back in the day we used to say let's go to a washington nationals game because
[01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:31.640]  nobody would ever show up at the washington nationals games but they seem to be getting
[01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:35.400]  a little bit more popular now so you get noticed there but now it's gotten to the point where
[01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:40.440]  people are saying no i i have they're giving me burner numbers they're giving me uh encrypted
[01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:43.960]  applications they're giving me different passwords changing their numbers on a weekly
[01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:49.320]  basis that is how much trouble these people are under that is how much scrutiny the deep state
[01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:53.640]  is under for trying to stop people like info and again deep state is able to leak everywhere
[01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:58.040]  continually they don't want the president getting any messages out to the public about
[01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:02.520]  what's really going on they want to totally isolate him well and we have an ongoing problem
[01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:09.080]  the government in washington is not the trump administration it's still the obama administration
[01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:14.520]  with the exception of a few heads of departments the the uh that's right so we're beating him
[01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:18.920]  politically in the public's mind but we're not when it comes to government because they're dug
[01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:25.640]  in and they're leaking their asses off in violation of the law they're they're leaking uh uh uh classified
[01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:33.560]  information to embarrass the president to delegitimize and destabilize him we need to clean house
[01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:39.240]  we need to move the obama appointees out of government and replace the agree why doesn't he
[01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:46.120]  launch the fireside chats exactly right uh i'd love to see president trump doing you know a live
[01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:51.720]  stream periscope a live stream facebook from the oval office every day he could show us exactly
[01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:56.280]  what he wants to talk about he could tell us his agenda directly he could even take questions from
[01:18:56.280 --> 01:19:00.760]  live comments the same way uh we do right here absolutely let me add this i know what's going
[01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:06.360]  on that would go and cut across the entire mainstream media bias and be able to talk directly to the
[01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:13.240]  people we're going to go to break and i want to come back and get into from your intel in dc
[01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:19.000]  what the next attacks are going to be on the president uh with jack possella but i also want
[01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:25.240]  to break down from my sources it's been discussed obviously the president going direct to the people
[01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:31.800]  not just these rallies the problem is that they've kind of gotten him where we'll search the production
[01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:36.840]  and into the crew and they've tried to make it sound so big and so fancy and so perfect
[01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:40.680]  that's how they've kept me from doing it all he needs is an hd camera streaming out at white
[01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:46.440]  house dot gov for everybody else to answer being re streamed on facebook twitter youtube and then
[01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:51.320]  them handing him questions once they print off during you know say 30 minute live deal and he
[01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:55.240]  he takes a few questions off the cuff but they're trying to isolate him and then he could sit there
[01:19:55.240 --> 01:20:21.720]  with his agenda what he really did and not just have little tweets but go on further

[01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:32.440]  got the good freedom caucus trying to do the right thing helping trump but we've got as
[01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:39.000]  usual the neo-con rhinos uh what's the what's the state in the spirit of dc right now you know
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:43.720]  i can actually give you a little bit of a personal story on that so i happen to be walking out in front
[01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:48.680]  of the senate dirksen office building yesterday when uh who should i happen to see as i'm walking
[01:25:48.680 --> 01:25:54.360]  uh to a meeting but senator ben sass that i went up and introduced myself and i said hi senator sass
[01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:59.400]  i'm i'm jack posovic it's great to meet you and as soon as he saw me now he's he's a never
[01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:04.680]  trump republican probably the leading never trump republican senator as soon as i said my name to him
[01:26:04.680 --> 01:26:10.680]  he completely lost his mind got triggered started screaming you're a liar you're a liar you're
[01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:17.880]  you're ruining everything and he he actually ran off going to his uh his chris ray uh deposition
[01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:22.040]  sort of over at the uh at the house below so that shows we're getting to him and just
[01:26:22.680 --> 01:26:27.320]  he's all i know who you are i know exactly who you are posovic you're a liar and just ran off
[01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:31.800]  that the mere mention of my name this is sitting u.s senator alex and i said gee you could have
[01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:37.160]  just said no thanks man uh but see this is the amount of under their skin and this is when
[01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:42.440]  there's no cameras on this is when the public eyes are now out there when the cameras are gone
[01:26:42.440 --> 01:26:47.640]  when they're in their their rooms in their dark smoke filled rooms they are scared of what trump
[01:26:47.640 --> 01:26:53.240]  is pushing they're scared and don't they get that if they destroy trump it'll only make him a martyr
[01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:58.360]  politically i mean look at how they try to destroy me with meghan kelly it destroyed her don't they
[01:26:58.360 --> 01:27:04.440]  get everyone has turned on them don't they get that's not hype that's real reality like you go out
[01:27:04.440 --> 01:27:09.240]  you try to catch fish you catch fish some days you don't catch fish they're not catching fish
[01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:15.800]  we're catching fish they are the most uncool out of style hated group of scum ever america
[01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:22.440]  is coming out of the trance don't they understand that no i really don't think they do alex because
[01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:26.520]  this is the trance that they've been trying to put all of america into for so many years you know
[01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:31.000]  believe us and we'll protect your rights believe us and we'll protect you your first amendment
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:35.240]  your second amendment rights your fourth amendment rights but what have we seen them do is roll back
[01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:39.560]  and roll back all of our civil liberties and this is regardless of what power and then bring in about
[01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:44.200]  your radical muslims and millions of illegals that have felonies and then just sit there and demonize
[01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:49.960]  flyover country and say the west will fall i mean hollywood is completely mentally ill and again
[01:27:49.960 --> 01:27:53.800]  people that have that much decadent power for 100 years are going to become decadent and evil
[01:27:53.800 --> 01:27:59.080]  that's just what's happened where are we historically right now roger stone why is the
[01:27:59.080 --> 01:28:05.880]  tide of crony globalism rushing out so fast uh alex i think it's because the american people
[01:28:05.880 --> 01:28:12.920]  are thoroughly disgusted uh i've never seen in 10 presidential campaigns a level of disillusionment
[01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:19.800]  a level of anger with the two-party duopoly with every political institution with the congress
[01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:25.400]  with big media and the american people have settled on donald trump to change all this
[01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:31.720]  they accuse us of being establishment trump will never be establishment he may have gone to worton
[01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:36.040]  he may be a billionaire he may be president united states but he thinks like an american he thinks
[01:28:36.040 --> 01:28:43.160]  like an outsider he will never be part of the two-party elitist uh leadership that's run the
[01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:47.320]  country even in all the profiles they admit from the time he was 30 doing business on his own
[01:28:47.320 --> 01:28:51.560]  like a partner with his dad he outperformed his older brother and the rest of it and his dad's
[01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:56.600]  retreat him as an equal that he was always us against the system americana the little guy
[01:28:56.600 --> 01:29:02.520]  beating the elites he's a fighter and he doesn't care if he gets a like uh invited to their cocktail
[01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:07.960]  parties it's the furthest thing from his mind if anything he'd like more time to spend with his
[01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:16.120]  family uh it is uh it is without any question he is the first outsider president we've had since
[01:29:16.120 --> 01:29:21.320]  ronald reagan and they've gone from being arrogant now to being fundamentally scared as besobic said
[01:29:21.320 --> 01:29:26.040]  that's what finally makes them dangerous i'm sad to see some of their arrogance starting to drain
[01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:33.320]  but i think their game plan is absolutely clear muhler stretches out his phony russian collusion
[01:29:33.320 --> 01:29:39.160]  delusion as long as he can hoping the democrats could control the house after the 18 elections
[01:29:39.160 --> 01:29:43.960]  stay there we got to go to break hard break let's talk about their game plan then let's take phone
[01:29:43.960 --> 01:29:52.840]  calls 800 25 9 9 2 3 1 first time college is 800 25 9 9 2 3 1 we're on the march the empires on the

[01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:15.000]  barack obama after running for president for the little guy campaigning against big money
[01:30:15.560 --> 01:30:19.000]  he got out of office and immediately became that which he campaigned against

[01:33:44.360 --> 01:33:48.760]  consultant oh thanks but he is launching in september uh this is the first week of september
[01:33:48.760 --> 01:33:54.280]  september 4th i think it's that monday syndicated radio transmission uh david night launches his
[01:33:54.280 --> 01:34:00.840]  in the middle of august so all of that is coming up jack the sobeck again as our guest infowars.com
[01:34:00.840 --> 01:34:10.440]  is the main news site looking at this uh you guys were getting cut off by the break you were breaking
[01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:17.960]  down their battle plan roger what they plan to do to bring down trump and delegitimize
[01:34:17.960 --> 01:34:23.320]  not just his election but the huge landslide of 2016 that will get the sobeck's take on that
[01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:30.120]  yeah alex since the entire russian collusion delusion has produced nothing they plan to stretch
[01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:36.920]  this out as long as they can uh mr muhler long time hitman for the clinton's and the bush is the guy
[01:34:36.920 --> 01:34:44.040]  who coached james comey on his testimony only weeks ago will drag out his investigation until
[01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:50.840]  there's a hopefully for him uh in the elitists a democratic majority in the house then it doesn't
[01:34:50.840 --> 01:35:00.680]  matter how thin or or asinine the charges he brings they would be used as a hook for impeachment the
[01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:07.080]  best way to combat this of course is to direct jeff sessions to convene a grand jury uh and to look
[01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:14.360]  into the matter of mass surveillance of american citizens as exposed by the feisa court only days
[01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:24.280]  before trump became president uh james clapper admiral rogers uh uh uh susan rice valerie jared
[01:35:24.280 --> 01:35:31.800]  and yes obama himself should be the targets of a federal indictment over the uh the invasion of
[01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:37.880]  privacy and the violation of the civil liberties sure but what about muhler basically only hiring
[01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:44.360]  democrats uh for his new giant witch hunt his little mini fbi and what about comey was on
[01:35:44.360 --> 01:35:49.880]  monday the hill confirmed that he did have a classified memo he legally didn't give it
[01:35:49.880 --> 01:35:54.920]  to the attorney general uh loretta lynch at the time and then sessions i mean these people
[01:35:54.920 --> 01:36:00.360]  are just lawless crooks well but the question you have to ask is where is jeff sessions is he
[01:36:00.360 --> 01:36:06.760]  sleeping what is he doing you have egregious violations of law by those who are smearing
[01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:14.600]  our president and they pay no penalty uh this morning on npr again some saying that uh jared
[01:36:14.600 --> 01:36:22.280]  kushner should have uh pardon me that um don trump jr should have reported his meeting with this
[01:36:22.280 --> 01:36:29.560]  russian lawyer to the fbi no john pedesta should have reported his meeting with the chinese ambassador
[01:36:29.560 --> 01:36:36.360]  but didn't uh that's right chinese ambassador about business in the emails to discuss policy
[01:36:36.360 --> 01:36:41.800]  in a secret meeting we have it they confirm the emails real they don't debate it but they change
[01:36:41.800 --> 01:36:46.360]  the subject just like mccain going and trying to find russians to make up the fact that they pee
[01:36:46.360 --> 01:36:53.560]  pee on the president uh then uh candidate trump again what they say trump did they did well and
[01:36:53.560 --> 01:37:00.360]  as you know my my book stones rules will be publishing here at info wars dot com in september
[01:37:00.360 --> 01:37:08.040]  my number one rule you don't win on defense the president has got the the power he's got the
[01:37:08.040 --> 01:37:15.160]  government uh and he needs to turn the table on his critics and pursue the rampant outrageous
[01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:22.680]  illegal activities of the obama administration and the neo con deep staters who to this day
[01:37:22.680 --> 01:37:27.720]  are illegally leaking against our president in effort to delegitimize him that's right
[01:37:27.720 --> 01:37:32.280]  roger stone is our guest jack but so but you're there in dc you talk to all the major activists
[01:37:32.280 --> 01:37:37.640]  you've got sources obviously in the white house that's been proven uh so does mike cernovich and
[01:37:37.640 --> 01:37:41.400]  now they have public affairs coming out and saying oh no they even know where we eat and
[01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:46.520]  what we're doing it's horrible and they got the cia in the article saying we've got to stop these
[01:37:46.520 --> 01:37:51.960]  people they're dangerous so now they're admitting we really have these sources but again our sources
[01:37:51.960 --> 01:37:57.000]  are just on what the president's real policies are and who the globalist are and that this person's
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:02.040]  a soros operative and this person is a mccain operative and then we have the proof these are
[01:38:02.040 --> 01:38:07.560]  people inside who are few and far between by the way in the swamp telling us what the different
[01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:12.760]  swamp creatures are doing they're not they're not giving a secret you know nsa data that's
[01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:17.560]  the globalists that are doing all that illegal crap uh interestingly enough alex uh when i stepped
[01:38:17.560 --> 01:38:24.600]  out i had a phone call from a source inside the house select committee who now sheds further light
[01:38:24.600 --> 01:38:30.360]  on why they have postponed my hearing uh the arrangement was two republican members two
[01:38:30.360 --> 01:38:37.320]  democratic members uh for a closed door hearing and that i would be allowed to give a an opening
[01:38:37.320 --> 01:38:45.640]  statement well evidently nobody wants to be the two democrats that adam schiff uh and eric swalwell
[01:38:45.640 --> 01:38:51.480]  in congress nobody wants to be that democrat the republicans that designated their two members
[01:38:51.480 --> 01:38:57.320]  traig outie uh and tom rooney they were prepared to be there i was prepared to be there none of
[01:38:57.320 --> 01:39:03.960]  these democrats want to face their own public words their own record their yellow their towers
[01:39:03.960 --> 01:39:10.920]  so the democrats have literally choked they get to go on the news they get to say lies about you
[01:39:10.920 --> 01:39:16.520]  never let you respond say they're going to call you for six months before a hearing uh say they've
[01:39:16.520 --> 01:39:22.600]  got the wiretap proof then say they never wiretapped they have just been tied up in knots making pinocchio
[01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:27.400]  look incredibly honest it's amazing so you just talk to your source during the breaks while you
[01:39:27.400 --> 01:39:33.240]  relate getting back relay this to people this is news breaking from the man sued by obama and
[01:39:33.240 --> 01:39:38.680]  george soros through the new law firm group they admittedly established six months ago a source on
[01:39:38.680 --> 01:39:43.640]  the committee tells me the democrats met and it went like this i think you should be the guy to go
[01:39:43.640 --> 01:39:48.440]  to the stone here no no no i think you should be the one to do it no i'm busy that day maybe you
[01:39:48.440 --> 01:39:54.040]  should do it these people are cowards they're yellow bellies they don't mind defaming you when
[01:39:54.040 --> 01:39:59.880]  they've got the spotlight in the public hearing but in terms of facing you and being confronted
[01:39:59.880 --> 01:40:05.160]  with their own words when congresswoman spire a member of the committee says and i quote stone
[01:40:05.160 --> 01:40:13.240]  works for the kremlin no i don't never have i done so that's defamatory apologize or i'll
[01:40:13.240 --> 01:40:17.800]  see you in court she said this not in the floor where she'd have legal protection and they say
[01:40:17.800 --> 01:40:23.240]  bring all your bring all your communications with the russians there are none it's like
[01:40:23.240 --> 01:40:27.560]  the federal elections commission the the the democrats wrote this letter saying they want
[01:40:27.560 --> 01:40:33.480]  all my documents of russian funding that's like saying they want all of the leprechauns that live
[01:40:33.480 --> 01:40:39.560]  in my basement's communications yeah it doesn't exist it's like give all my martian communications
[01:40:39.560 --> 01:40:45.960]  to them there are no martian communications yeah it's uh this is um uh this is a classic
[01:40:45.960 --> 01:40:50.520]  case of nobody wanting to live up to their responsibilities it's incredible jack posobic
[01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:55.560]  i mean you're in the middle of this uh where is all this going they're trying to do two things
[01:40:55.560 --> 01:41:00.280]  alexand and roger i know you've seen this before with many special prosecutors in the past uh what
[01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:04.760]  they're going to do is eventually try to justify their own existence of their of their commission
[01:41:04.760 --> 01:41:09.800]  by catching someone uh speaking out of turn or getting some minor detail wrong and then running
[01:41:09.800 --> 01:41:14.120]  them up for perjury like they would do with did the scooter leavey during the bush administration
[01:41:14.120 --> 01:41:19.240]  they're going to simply go go and go and go and go until fish and fish and fish and fish
[01:41:19.240 --> 01:41:23.960]  until they're able to find evidence of a crime that was committed during the conduct of the
[01:41:23.960 --> 01:41:28.520]  investigation rather than anything that had to do with the convening of it and while they're doing
[01:41:28.520 --> 01:41:33.720]  this what they're attempting to do is to pit the members of the trump campaign the members of those
[01:41:33.720 --> 01:41:38.120]  people who are the trump supporters the supporters of the administration against each other that's
[01:41:38.120 --> 01:41:43.640]  why the new york times is planting these seeds that jared kushner was the one who leaked the
[01:41:43.640 --> 01:41:49.720]  donald trump junior emails when we're actually saying no no no jared kushner sent his to close
[01:41:49.720 --> 01:41:55.880]  the meeting to the fbi and the fbi we've seen james comey going in and out they're the ones
[01:41:55.880 --> 01:42:02.760]  leaking is the one leaking to the new york times the idea the idea that that um that jared kushner
[01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:09.160]  would leak against his own uh brother-in-law uh is an outrage it's a falsehood uh i believe
[01:42:09.160 --> 01:42:17.240]  kory loondowski actually is one of the sources he has known animus towards don jr don jr helped
[01:42:17.240 --> 01:42:21.960]  remove his incompetent leadership from the trump campaign you know i don't normally disagree with
[01:42:21.960 --> 01:42:27.400]  you and and that may be but when you've got comey and the deep state and obama and all them bragging
[01:42:27.960 --> 01:42:32.520]  in january of this year before trump got sworn in that we've got all the data we've wiretapped
[01:42:32.520 --> 01:42:38.120]  we've got everything uh and i mean we know they've had this for a while and we know comey who lied
[01:42:38.120 --> 01:42:43.880]  and said he wasn't uh leaking now admits he's leaking and who said he didn't have classified
[01:42:43.880 --> 01:42:50.920]  info when he did the guy is a perjurer and a liar we have him he is the big fat stinking leader of
[01:42:50.920 --> 01:42:57.720]  the rat battalion he is the lawyer that covered up for the clintons he is the enemy of this republic
[01:42:57.720 --> 01:43:02.680]  he is the mole i agree with you if i were the president right now what i would do
[01:43:03.240 --> 01:43:08.920]  is direct jeff sessions to appoint a special counsel to specifically look at the question
[01:43:08.920 --> 01:43:14.280]  i agree special counsel's on all these scumbags absolutely but focus on the illegal surveillance
[01:43:14.280 --> 01:43:19.400]  of americans this is the crime that makes watergate look like and it makes everybody a plaintiff
[01:43:19.400 --> 01:43:23.160]  and everybody has standing that is what must be done of the constitution you're absolutely right
[01:43:23.160 --> 01:43:26.920]  but let me then now ask this question of jack was so began you and by the way i think bob bar would
[01:43:26.920 --> 01:43:32.200]  be the perfect guy for that job he's on next hour former u.s attorney straight arrow he can tell you
[01:43:32.200 --> 01:43:37.880]  when he comes on about muhler pressuring him to drop the wake-up question when he started asking
[01:43:37.880 --> 01:43:43.000]  inconvenient questions about the conflagration at the wake-up compound
[01:43:45.960 --> 01:43:54.600]  this is just this is just mind-blowing uh so but you're there in dc what is what is the mindset
[01:43:54.600 --> 01:43:57.880]  i mean do they really still think they're going to win do they not know the public's
[01:43:57.880 --> 01:44:03.720]  totally turned against them uh they honestly aren't aren't sure because alex these people live inside
[01:44:03.720 --> 01:44:07.240]  a giant bubble even the people who are the representatives they're not representing
[01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:12.040]  the people of their districts they're representing tiny enclaves of liberalism and globalism
[01:44:12.040 --> 01:44:17.160]  from los angeles to new york city to washington dc and they never leave those little bubbles
[01:44:17.160 --> 01:44:22.200]  only to maybe stand at one campaign rally every once in a while uh they're they're sitting here
[01:44:22.200 --> 01:44:26.920]  and they're thinking that all of this stuff is going to work and to an extent to the extent
[01:44:26.920 --> 01:44:31.400]  that they've been able to block the trump agenda i would have to say there is some truth to that
[01:44:31.400 --> 01:44:35.720]  you know we we look today where is the border wall we look to set today to say where is the
[01:44:35.720 --> 01:44:40.120]  state of the illegal immigration programs and they have not yet received the funding that we
[01:44:40.120 --> 01:44:45.560]  were promised by paul ryan by ryan's previous why has that not happened when the republicans control
[01:44:45.560 --> 01:44:50.920]  both houses of congress and the white house i asked it's simply because of sabotage from our own
[01:44:50.920 --> 01:44:56.600]  party and they're doing a very good job exactly but we've got to get the word out that is not the
[01:44:56.600 --> 01:45:02.200]  freedom caucus or trump doing this it is it is the ryanos show the ryanos the democrats they're
[01:45:02.200 --> 01:45:08.200]  the enemy we cannot give the democrats the house of the senate or the impeachment is coming just as
[01:45:08.200 --> 01:45:13.320]  night follows day and that's their game plan there's no question about it look they're extremely
[01:45:13.320 --> 01:45:20.040]  well funded this is why i tell all my friends to go to the info or store because we don't have
[01:45:20.040 --> 01:45:26.040]  billionaire corporate sponsors we don't have unlimited money for legal fees do you think these

[01:47:28.520 --> 01:47:32.280]  their money into another republican to make sure you're getting it back into congress and people
[01:47:32.280 --> 01:47:37.240]  are so anti-establishment he talked about this they saw him as establishment because he'd been
[01:47:37.240 --> 01:47:42.280]  a republican in a decade ago even though he did the impeachment even though he tried to stop the
[01:47:42.280 --> 01:47:48.680]  missiles getting transferred to north korea and china even though he did so much good stuff uh they
[01:47:48.680 --> 01:47:55.320]  put in another republican who was new so i mean again that's that's sad but it shows out the people
[01:47:55.320 --> 01:48:01.240]  are so anti-establishment that even republicans have got to watch it that's why we've got to defeat
[01:48:01.240 --> 01:48:07.400]  paul ryan we've got to get rid of him like canter we've got to get rid of him and uh let me ask both
[01:48:07.400 --> 01:48:11.800]  of you and then we're going to skip this break so we have more time to go to calls how do we defeat
[01:48:11.800 --> 01:48:17.400]  the rhinos how do we target them uh because you know congressman scolese is a patriot he just got
[01:48:17.400 --> 01:48:22.680]  out of intensive care again thank god he's alive i don't want anything bad to happen to paul ryan
[01:48:22.680 --> 01:48:28.360]  turn him into a martyr uh but i mean you know paul ryan is just a classic comes off like a
[01:48:28.360 --> 01:48:33.640]  total psychopath i mean he just is a slick liar he's totally full of crap he's sabotaging this
[01:48:33.640 --> 01:48:38.360]  country uh he's trying to keep obama care in place he's trying to keep high taxes in place
[01:48:38.360 --> 01:48:44.040]  yeah i don't know what dirt they've gone on but i am just so sick of these type of people these
[01:48:44.040 --> 01:48:50.200]  these blue blood country club republicans besobic what do we do you know if we just sessions isn't
[01:48:50.200 --> 01:48:53.880]  going to convene these special prosecutors and investigations and alex i think we're going to
[01:48:53.880 --> 01:48:59.080]  have to start doing it ourselves there's a lot of public disclosure in terms of these uh fec
[01:48:59.080 --> 01:49:03.320]  filings for campaigns there's a lot of public disclosure in terms of when people are going to
[01:49:03.320 --> 01:49:08.600]  events and not going to events and now that the republicans have control of the ethics committee
[01:49:08.600 --> 01:49:15.160]  in the house and i'm told actually from sources that the ethics committee is headed by a provost
[01:49:15.160 --> 01:49:20.680]  from republican that we are going to start actually calling these people up for their own ethics
[01:49:20.680 --> 01:49:26.520]  violations obama previously had his ethics uh czar in there that guy has finally resigned we've
[01:49:26.520 --> 01:49:32.200]  gotten rid of him it's time to appoint a new ethics uh chair for the white house work with the republican
[01:49:32.200 --> 01:49:37.000]  ethics committee in congress to start going after these people for their funding find out what it's
[01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:41.400]  tied to if you want to talk about foreign collusion and foreign influence oh i say bring it on let's
[01:49:41.400 --> 01:49:50.600]  talk about it roger uh you know i think jack's absolutely right um i'm really disappointed in
[01:49:50.600 --> 01:49:55.640]  in jeff sessions i think he's a good man he's wrong about marijuana we've talked about that but
[01:49:56.760 --> 01:50:02.440]  he is a veteran former state attorney general he understands the law the violations
[01:50:03.240 --> 01:50:08.760]  by obama and his inner circle of our civil liberties are more egregious than anything
[01:50:08.760 --> 01:50:13.960]  that happened uh in watergate and they're certainly more serious than the russian
[01:50:13.960 --> 01:50:20.840]  collusion a delusion uh that the democrats seem to be committed to uh but you do not win
[01:50:20.840 --> 01:50:26.520]  on defense it is time to get on offense it's time to start locking some of these people up
[01:50:27.080 --> 01:50:35.000]  we learned months ago about susan rice's use of unmasked surveillance uh material for political
[01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:40.600]  purposes this is a crime and then rice comes out and says oh she's been unfairly targeted
[01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:46.600]  because she's a woman and she's black no you've been targeted because you broke the law you see
[01:50:47.160 --> 01:50:52.840]  i know you expected hillary to win and that all your crimes would be covered up that didn't happen
[01:50:53.400 --> 01:50:59.720]  no persons above the law that's what they told us in the wake of watergate it's time for susan rice
[01:50:59.720 --> 01:51:06.680]  to do some serious time absolutely said uh with truth you know i see how they lie as a religion
[01:51:07.480 --> 01:51:11.320]  and then i see how the greatest value i've got still on the truth and roger you kind of
[01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:18.360]  buy into it if they're gonna call you a villain you go with it and take your attack like judo
[01:51:18.360 --> 01:51:23.240]  turn into something good but i've never seen you do a dirty trick your currency is is is
[01:51:23.240 --> 01:51:27.480]  being accurate with the stuff you told me it's some of the most accurate info i've been you know
[01:51:27.480 --> 01:51:32.840]  given the last three years or so i'd say 98 percent accurate and it is something to kind of play along
[01:51:32.840 --> 01:51:38.840]  with that but in truth they are the villains i mean i know c&n gets paid by Gulf state dictatorships
[01:51:38.840 --> 01:51:45.880]  put up promo pieces and by the un everybody else is reporting orgies of violence 470 something cops
[01:51:45.880 --> 01:51:50.520]  injured thousands of others injured burning buildings looks like you know a bombing run
[01:51:50.520 --> 01:51:56.920]  happened with a b-52 or something and they're seeing in totally peaceful against trump it wasn't
[01:51:56.920 --> 01:52:03.080]  even against trump it just they are such liars and i think they realize they're discredited so
[01:52:03.080 --> 01:52:09.640]  they're just committing to just be disruptive and now troll us like we're in middle school i mean
[01:52:09.640 --> 01:52:13.800]  to understand their psychology think arrested development do you think that's what it is or
[01:52:13.800 --> 01:52:19.720]  is there some sophisticated uh equation of deception i'm missing i think a lot of it's about
[01:52:19.720 --> 01:52:26.280]  money alex i think it's i think there's a there's a market decision an economic decision that was
[01:52:26.280 --> 01:52:33.720]  made at c&n that they wanted to be the anti-trump network that they wanted to go for the small
[01:52:33.720 --> 01:52:41.240]  subset of liberal misfits uh who will go to the network that is virulently anti-trump you see
[01:52:41.240 --> 01:52:45.880]  what the way so it's a cult and the more radical members of the cult accelerated it's radicalization
[01:52:45.880 --> 01:52:53.720]  and the real question will become uh what happens in the at&t time warner merger i can't see the
[01:52:53.720 --> 01:53:01.400]  trump administration approving this merger as long as jeff zucker is at cnn and cnn is being used
[01:53:01.400 --> 01:53:06.200]  as a weapon by the way they're calling that corrupt if he holds it up they're trying to destroy him
[01:53:06.200 --> 01:53:11.400]  and it's already a questionable merger it shouldn't happen anyways well and sadly board members jake
[01:53:11.400 --> 01:53:18.200]  tapper uh uh uh uh hold on go ahead jump in the subject oh sorry i was gonna say on that point
[01:53:18.200 --> 01:53:23.560]  you know my my source is on the fdc uh looking at the merger right now are are saying that it's
[01:53:23.560 --> 01:53:27.800]  a currently a split decision they are not sure whether or not to allow it the interesting thing
[01:53:27.800 --> 01:53:32.920]  is that cnn loses more and more ratings their time order stock has actually gone down seven
[01:53:32.920 --> 01:53:37.960]  hundred million dollars since the uh the cnn meme wars have started the last few weeks we've seen
[01:53:37.960 --> 01:53:43.480]  their doxing their targeting of individual citizens oh yeah this rebranding of cnn from enemies of
[01:53:43.480 --> 01:53:51.080]  america to trash of the earth is is is unreversible go ahead so yeah and so a lot of people understand
[01:53:51.080 --> 01:53:57.080]  the strategic pressure that's being put on time Warner right now to either divest cnn as a company
[01:53:57.080 --> 01:54:02.600]  and let them see if they can stand on their own two feet which is unlikely or to go in there take
[01:54:02.600 --> 01:54:08.440]  the merger at a much lower valuation with the cnn product and completely clean house either way
[01:54:08.440 --> 01:54:13.480]  jeff zucker my my indications are that he is going to go whether or not he gets a golden parachute
[01:54:13.480 --> 01:54:19.480]  we'll see but he will not be ceo of uh of cnn much longer the spin-off strategy i think is
[01:54:19.480 --> 01:54:24.840]  problematic what i would not want to see is a jeff bezos or some other billionaire leftist
[01:54:24.840 --> 01:54:31.400]  elitist by this company and infuse it uh with capital i would much rather see uh time Warner
[01:54:31.400 --> 01:54:39.880]  replace zucker with more mainstream leadership uh and try to revive cnn as a legitimate news
[01:54:39.880 --> 01:54:44.840]  organization that is the only way to save it would would be to revamp it and have it come back since
[01:54:44.840 --> 01:54:49.560]  fox news is killing itself if it came back as the new libertarian channel it would end up with
[01:54:49.560 --> 01:54:54.920]  you know 50 million viewers an hour it'll never happen though they're too arrogant let's go to
[01:54:54.920 --> 01:55:02.040]  phone calls we got jenny jesse ledo uh evan bob in canada and many many others uh let's go to
[01:55:02.040 --> 01:55:08.440]  ledo in california you're on the air thanks for holding how you doing alex and roger i just wanted
[01:55:08.440 --> 01:55:14.680]  to uh come in with some information um hasn't seen donald trump jr in the trump campaign being attacked
[01:55:14.680 --> 01:55:18.760]  for colluding or anything of this nature the only thing i could look up and just gonna give you a
[01:55:18.760 --> 01:55:23.880]  little bit of backstory i mean i was born in morocco grew up in america i'm a united states
[01:55:23.880 --> 01:55:29.480]  army veteran um and while i while i was in the military um i was on a little detail and i would
[01:55:29.480 --> 01:55:35.400]  like everybody to look up hillary clinton it's 12 million dollars for hosting the global clinton
[01:55:35.400 --> 01:55:41.240]  initiative in maricash morocco okay while being secretary of state per campaign gaining this
[01:55:41.240 --> 01:55:47.800]  resources they are gaining gaining this this type of um oh globalism is all about selling your
[01:55:47.800 --> 01:55:52.840]  country out to foreign multinationals and companies and countries exactly the clinton's
[01:55:52.840 --> 01:55:57.480]  totally sold us out to the chinese totally sold us out of the un and then to point their finger
[01:55:57.480 --> 01:56:03.080]  at trump's son meeting with a russian for dirt on her as if we're colluding with the russians
[01:56:03.080 --> 01:56:09.400]  i mean this is absolutely insane so you could so you could pull it up just just just type in hillary
[01:56:09.400 --> 01:56:15.560]  clinton morocco in 2014 while being secretary of state she she's invited to morocco for a 12 million
[01:56:15.560 --> 01:56:20.920]  dollar donation to the global uh now there it is hillary got 12 million for the clinton deal at a
[01:56:20.920 --> 01:56:25.800]  global government meeting exactly she's at foreign meetings getting her private foundation paid while
[01:56:25.800 --> 01:56:31.400]  she's sitting in government totally illegal and even double crossing obama the obama administration
[01:56:31.400 --> 01:56:35.960]  concerned about the way this would look had a requirement that she would clear any of these
[01:56:35.960 --> 01:56:41.720]  foreign contributions with them but she didn't on many occasions look meanwhile the federal election
[01:56:41.720 --> 01:56:47.720]  commission says that we're not allowed to talk to people about campaigns talking is now money and
[01:56:47.720 --> 01:56:52.760]  they regulate that what type of delusional power grab is that but let's let's face it hillary clinton
[01:56:52.760 --> 01:56:58.840]  will look great in an orange jumpsuit can't happen too soon that's right great points lito thanks for
[01:56:58.840 --> 01:57:05.320]  bringing that up uh jack the subjects our guests let's go to jesse in missouri you're on the air jesse
[01:57:06.920 --> 01:57:15.400]  how are you doing alexi doing roger and jack what what i'm failing to see is the american people
[01:57:15.400 --> 01:57:22.440]  stepping up you know we have the power there's so many people in this country that aren't doing
[01:57:22.440 --> 01:57:28.760]  anything they're not calling their representatives they're not writing letters they're just sitting
[01:57:28.760 --> 01:57:34.520]  by idly and accepting this russian nonsense well that's what i'm saying though we got a fraction
[01:57:34.520 --> 01:57:39.480]  of america standing up and we're we're we're in a fight we're we're barely winning and if everybody
[01:57:39.480 --> 01:57:44.760]  listening understands they hate you they hate info wars because they hate you they see you as the
[01:57:44.760 --> 01:57:50.760]  awake americans as the hope as the light in the dark and you are you are the resistance folks when
[01:57:50.760 --> 01:57:55.320]  you support us when you spread the word when you pray for us that moves mountains and i think what
[01:57:55.320 --> 01:58:06.280]  jesse saying is we need more people to take action right jesse and i find that to be kind of uh
[01:58:06.280 --> 01:58:15.000]  ridiculous you know like we're stupid and you know we're we're just as smart as everybody else
[01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:20.200]  well that's what it is it's not that people think of themselves humbly is this good to be humble as
[01:58:20.200 --> 01:58:25.640]  not being leaders and it's kind of just living life but extraordinary circumstances make extraordinary
[01:58:25.640 --> 01:58:30.760]  people we're in extraordinary times all of you who have been so humble have to activate call

[02:01:03.320 --> 02:01:09.720]  trying to force these countries like poland like romania like belarus to take in these migrants
[02:01:09.720 --> 02:01:13.480]  forcing them in they're standing up they're saying no we want to defend our culture we want to defend
[02:01:13.480 --> 02:01:19.000]  our borders but the EU is saying we will find you and soros is turning his mouthpiece propaganda
[02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:24.440]  media into attacking the people that are standing up for themselves the same way they stand up against
[02:01:24.440 --> 02:01:29.160]  trump you know jack i think what you're going to find because i've just returned from an eastern
[02:01:29.160 --> 02:01:37.080]  european trip is that the united states embassies in bukarest in budapest in ankara are completely
[02:01:37.080 --> 02:01:43.640]  controlled by george soros george soros financed the college educations of most of the employees
[02:01:44.360 --> 02:01:52.040]  in of the u.s. embassy in bukarest these are nests of open societies people and you have to wonder
[02:01:52.680 --> 02:01:58.040]  what is rex tillerson waiting for in terms of cleaning these people out but then you see that
[02:01:58.040 --> 02:02:05.640]  tillerson has hired this woman fiona hill a former staffer for soros who's infiltrated the trump
[02:02:05.640 --> 02:02:11.880]  state department and is arguing against aligning ourselves with the hungarian government for example
[02:02:12.600 --> 02:02:20.760]  in their efforts to isolate and identify soros as an enemy of democracy it's outrageous that this
[02:02:20.760 --> 02:02:26.520]  can go on there's millions still pouring out of the state department in terms of aid for these
[02:02:26.520 --> 02:02:31.800]  global warming programs these climate programs that are going directly to the pockets of some of the
[02:02:31.800 --> 02:02:36.040]  most terrible dictators around the world in africa uh some of these people that are extremely
[02:02:36.040 --> 02:02:41.480]  anti-democracy in eastern europe however soros has no problem with it as long as they play by
[02:02:41.480 --> 02:02:48.600]  sure jack it shows the games they play peter southerland george soros all of them said we're
[02:02:48.600 --> 02:02:51.640]  going to get rid of the borders we're going to cause a migrant crisis we're going to destabilize
[02:02:51.640 --> 02:02:55.480]  the middle east we're they're going to bring these people in column refugees they're almost all
[02:02:55.480 --> 02:03:00.680]  military age men that when they cause problems will make europe give up its rights to not make the
[02:03:00.680 --> 02:03:06.440]  muslims mad we're being held hostage this is their plan and people are revolting against it
[02:03:06.440 --> 02:03:11.400]  and even bill gates has come out and said europe has to stop this because he knows the sleeping
[02:03:11.400 --> 02:03:17.560]  giants awake i want to invite you to uh report for us i don't even report for the rebel media

[02:03:36.600 --> 02:03:41.320]  next hour uh with of course meghan kelly the first installment being exposed what you did
[02:03:41.320 --> 02:03:46.440]  behind the scenes is going to be powerful uh but continuing here the rebel dot media citizens
[02:03:46.440 --> 02:03:50.920]  for trump dot com that's jack besovak what else is coming up when you're on the nightly news tonight
[02:03:50.920 --> 02:03:58.120]  well i've got to tell you this uh this attack on me and my family by these high priced obama
[02:03:58.120 --> 02:04:05.000]  leftist soros backed lawyers um what came out of left field uh and i can't even tell you i've
[02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:12.200]  got 30 40 press calls waiting for comment um i've put together a statement but it's very important
[02:04:12.200 --> 02:04:19.800]  to nail a lie immediately they can't even prove that the dnc emails were hacked never mind that
[02:04:19.800 --> 02:04:26.600]  they were hacked by roger stone or the trump can the new york times admits no proof uh it's bogus uh
[02:04:26.600 --> 02:04:31.800]  but it's an attempt again to achieve through the courts what they couldn't achieve at the ballot
[02:04:31.800 --> 02:04:38.360]  box it's meant to try to remove a president trump i guess they see that the congressional inquiries
[02:04:38.360 --> 02:04:46.120]  going nowhere uh and now they hope for a left wing uh district of columbia judge to uh allow them to
[02:04:46.120 --> 02:04:51.000]  violate our civil rights it's it's it's total intimidation and it's not gonna work roger stone
[02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:54.680]  good to have you on board with the info war great to be here i tell you we're really giving giving
[02:04:54.680 --> 02:05:01.640]  them hell thanks to listeners support we'll be back with bob bar stay with us here's the truth
[02:05:01.640 --> 02:05:06.200]  about the don jr emails there's nothing there but considering the seriousness and the response
[02:05:06.200 --> 02:05:10.440]  from the liberal media and democrats the thinking person must wonder why there was no such outrage
[02:05:10.440 --> 02:05:15.240]  when hillary clinton illegally had classified emails on a private server then deleted 33 000
[02:05:15.240 --> 02:05:20.200]  emails then smashed her old phone with a hammer but what about natalia vessel nikaya don jr
[02:05:20.200 --> 02:05:24.360]  didn't know he was meeting her either her or rob goldstone lied about the premise of the meeting
[02:05:24.360 --> 02:05:28.680]  and if he had known her name prior to the meeting don jr would have known she had obama fingerprints
[02:05:28.680 --> 02:05:33.160]  all over her she was potentially in the country illegally only in the country temporarily thanks
[02:05:33.160 --> 02:05:38.040]  to obama's department of justice however that state had expired previous to her meeting don jr
[02:05:38.040 --> 02:05:41.880]  eight days after the meeting she was sitting next to obama's russian ambassador during a foreign
[02:05:41.880 --> 02:05:48.360]  affairs committee hearing so tim kane is obama's doj guilty of treason who knew she was here illegally
[02:05:48.360 --> 02:05:54.120]  and why no investigation into that vessel nikaya's alleged law firm in russia has no website no working
[02:05:54.120 --> 02:06:00.920]  phone and no email for info wars dot com who is natalia vessel nikaya this is our insurer after

[02:08:52.200 --> 02:08:56.600]  and he goes you know you ought to get bob barron he can really expose muhler and what he did at the
[02:08:56.600 --> 02:09:01.560]  wake of siege and all the corruption also coming i was like well that's actually what i have him
[02:09:01.560 --> 02:09:05.160]  on today i've been trying to get him on for a few weeks you know since the whole comey thing
[02:09:05.160 --> 02:09:09.800]  blew up and now we've got him today also heads up liberty guard fighting the unconstitutional
[02:09:09.800 --> 02:09:15.640]  stuff with the nsa and the psa and all the rest of it uh but but bob bar's the guy that you know
[02:09:15.640 --> 02:09:21.400]  crafted the articles of impeachment that actually got that going and we churning him back in congress
[02:09:21.400 --> 02:09:27.080]  i wanted to get him on just to talk about the waterfront what it's like to see these
[02:09:27.080 --> 02:09:32.360]  spectacles of john mccain sending people to russia to england meeting with the russians
[02:09:32.360 --> 02:09:37.800]  wanting dirt this lawyer that they let back in even though her visa was out now connected to
[02:09:37.800 --> 02:09:44.440]  soros and anti-trump rallies and and a meeting with the democrats and clearly working for them
[02:09:44.440 --> 02:09:51.720]  trying to set up uh donald jr and i said give the guy a medal going to try to find out dirt
[02:09:51.720 --> 02:09:55.640]  about hillary that's what you're supposed to do mccain didn't give it crimes going to try to find
[02:09:55.640 --> 02:10:01.240]  dirt on on trump the issue is they made it up though the whole ppgate things now have been
[02:10:01.240 --> 02:10:05.800]  proven to be a fraud but we know hillary sold out our uranium we know the clinton foundation
[02:10:06.440 --> 02:10:11.320]  would meet morocco and get 12 million dollars from foreign donors while she was sitting secretary
[02:10:11.320 --> 02:10:16.200]  of state i mean everything they say about trump who's fired all the lobbyists you name it is
[02:10:16.200 --> 02:10:21.800]  exactly what they've done and i'm not on some trump worship bandwagon just to do it it's it's
[02:10:21.800 --> 02:10:28.360]  that we haven't had a president this clean in a long time and he's actually got illegal 63
[02:10:28.360 --> 02:10:33.400]  percent down coming across the border as he's killed the tpp's got the stock market up and hundreds
[02:10:33.400 --> 02:10:38.440]  of billions of new investment and he's trying to get taxes cut but he's got the republican
[02:10:38.440 --> 02:10:44.520]  establishment against him so i've we've got bob bar a bob bar dot org liberty guard dot org you
[02:10:44.520 --> 02:10:49.960]  couldn't have a better guest on he's been a federal prosecutor than a u.s attorney than in
[02:10:49.960 --> 02:10:57.000]  congress cia whole nine yards from every angle for a professor you name it just to give us his
[02:10:57.000 --> 02:11:02.520]  view of the world right now the left saying they want cog they want to cancel the last election
[02:11:02.520 --> 02:11:08.680]  uh the left saying hashtag hunt republicans i mean i've never in history except maybe in
[02:11:08.680 --> 02:11:15.240]  weimar germany on the 1932 or something seen a more volatile climate and it's all from them
[02:11:15.880 --> 02:11:22.040]  and then polosi saying we're winners we're the face chucky schumer and i when they're so unpopular
[02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:28.200]  it's just they're so delusional but i'm not arrogant i think they're dangerous i think they
[02:11:28.200 --> 02:11:35.560]  could somehow even though they're you know half lobotomized they're so bold if we don't stand
[02:11:35.560 --> 02:11:42.600]  against them they could really plunge this country into greater chaos uh former congressman bob bar
[02:11:42.600 --> 02:11:48.760]  what do you think about that little rant well it it wasn't a rant it was simply a uh a factual
[02:11:48.760 --> 02:11:56.440]  statement uh and i agree a hundred percent with with what you're saying it if it weren't serious
[02:11:56.440 --> 02:12:03.080]  it would be funny uh some of the what i call the uh the post factual statements that uh that the
[02:12:03.080 --> 02:12:10.040]  left uh makes continuously whether it's uh polosi or whether it's uh the who's the uh
[02:12:10.600 --> 02:12:18.760]  pocahontas uh up in elizabeth warren um the problem is when you have a group of people in
[02:12:18.760 --> 02:12:25.960]  this case the democratic party and and their leftist allies uh making over and over and over again
[02:12:25.960 --> 02:12:33.560]  statements and setting setting out uh agendas that are that have no relationship whatsoever to
[02:12:34.280 --> 02:12:41.960]  the real world or to facts they just make stuff up uh it's funny but it is extremely dangerous
[02:12:41.960 --> 02:12:48.200]  and that's what worries me when you have people uh you know despite the fact that elizabeth warren
[02:12:48.200 --> 02:12:57.000]  is uh oh her lack of substance is probably only uh second to anansi poloses uh when you have people
[02:12:57.000 --> 02:13:05.480]  like that and the others up there making these idiotic uh untrue uh nonfactual statements over
[02:13:05.480 --> 02:13:13.320]  and over and over again it's dangerous because these people are in fact in positions to do things to
[02:13:13.320 --> 02:13:19.880]  to the american people on behalf of the government can very quickly turn from just sort of funny
[02:13:19.880 --> 02:13:27.400]  to extremely dangerous as a former u.s attorney and prosecutor what do you make of comey and now
[02:13:27.400 --> 02:13:33.240]  they admit it's classified and he said he didn't leak but he did leak and all the clear cut perjury
[02:13:33.800 --> 02:13:42.440]  uh going on in the illegal leaking it just seems wild eyed it is and i'm i'm i've i've
[02:13:42.440 --> 02:13:46.920]  met comey i don't know him well at all and it's been a number of years since i've actually
[02:13:46.920 --> 02:13:54.600]  seen him in person uh but the appearance the statements that he made when he he went before
[02:13:55.240 --> 02:14:04.520]  the senate several weeks ago and this this utterly uncomprehensible idiotic scenario that he admitted
[02:14:04.520 --> 02:14:11.000]  to that well he didn't trust the president so he runs back to his office and he you know
[02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:17.800]  dictates these memos and then because he was afraid that the president might lie about his
[02:14:17.800 --> 02:14:24.840]  meeting with him he gives uh this information this memo or memos to a friend of his to then
[02:14:24.840 --> 02:14:30.840]  give to the new york times uh one the guy doesn't even have the courage to do something himself and
[02:14:30.840 --> 02:14:38.360]  accept the consequences of it he has to go through somebody else to basically do his dirty work uh
[02:14:38.360 --> 02:14:47.480]  but uh you know this this border is not just on ridiculous uh but criminal uh and where you have
[02:14:47.480 --> 02:14:53.400]  somebody in in his position that carries you know whether we like it or not a lot of gravitas so to
[02:14:53.400 --> 02:14:59.080]  speak simply because he is in fact occupied very high positions in our government including the
[02:14:59.080 --> 02:15:05.720]  number two person at the department of justice uh and the head of the fbi we have to take this
[02:15:05.720 --> 02:15:15.880]  stuff seriously uh and uh hopefully uh chris chris ray who is in the process of being confirmed for
[02:15:15.880 --> 02:15:25.160]  the fbi director uh will actually go where the evidence leads him and recommend uh prosecutions
[02:15:26.520 --> 02:15:30.840]  former congressman bob bar former federal prosecutor us attorneys weathers right now
[02:15:30.840 --> 02:15:37.320]  looking at this and just looking at at at muhler and i know you've been critical of muhler you've
[02:15:37.320 --> 02:15:41.800]  you've been there when he's testified uh with weiko and and other debacles these guys are
[02:15:41.800 --> 02:15:49.560]  two best buddies i look at everybody muhler is hiring it's almost all rabid democratic party
[02:15:49.560 --> 02:15:57.240]  operatives with access to grind what do you make of all that that's uh it it seems to me that uh
[02:15:57.240 --> 02:16:02.440]  that muhler and and you mentioned uh the weiko hearings uh just to kind of refresh your your
[02:16:02.440 --> 02:16:10.120]  listeners uh recollection of that back during the weiko hearings which was in early 1995 but when
[02:16:10.120 --> 02:16:15.000]  i was a at the time of freshman member of the congress and the judiciary committee and we
[02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:23.160]  were holding a series of very important hearings on the weiko tragedy uh one morning before we were
[02:16:23.160 --> 02:16:29.720]  set to have a number of fbi agents testified before uh the congress the committee that i was
[02:16:29.720 --> 02:16:38.920]  working on i get a call uh out of the blue from bob muhler uh to who was at the time uh he wasn't
[02:16:38.920 --> 02:16:45.240]  the fbi director but he was an official government employee i believe at the time bob muhler was
[02:16:45.240 --> 02:16:51.000]  serving as a an assistant u.s attorney in the u.s attorney's office for the district of columbia
[02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:58.440]  and uh he calls me up out of the blue and and says essentially and i have this uh set forth in my
[02:16:58.440 --> 02:17:05.080]  book on the impeachment the meaning of is uh he says uh bob i know you have some uh witnesses
[02:17:05.080 --> 02:17:11.000]  there today from the fbi and these weiko hearings uh i know these guys you know these guys they're
[02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:17.000]  good guys so go easy on them uh that's not the way i operate it's not the way you operate alex
[02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:22.760]  it's not the way you know your listeners uh expect to see government operating but it's
[02:17:22.760 --> 02:17:30.760]  part of the good old boy deep state network up there uh that is basically corrupting air
[02:17:30.760 --> 02:17:37.480]  they're trying to corrupt their entire system of justice in this uh in this country and komi
[02:17:37.480 --> 02:17:47.320]  uh it was right in the thick of it uh what what he did was highly inappropriate if not illegal i mean
[02:17:47.320 --> 02:17:51.960]  going back to high school i like to watch c span and then when i was in college watching you and
[02:17:51.960 --> 02:17:58.040]  then i've been on the air since i was like 21 but i've never seen such wildness and lying by the
[02:17:58.040 --> 02:18:03.720]  media and just personally whether it's the new york times or the washington post or texas monthly
[02:18:03.720 --> 02:18:08.920]  i was reading texas monthly article about me and it just has anonymous sources that once i walked
[02:18:08.920 --> 02:18:16.200]  into a movie theater and told a guy named doyle i'm fake i believe nothing i say and they just
[02:18:16.200 --> 02:18:23.080]  had this false statement in there and then they quote somebody else saying you know once i walked
[02:18:23.080 --> 02:18:32.920]  in a store and said i'm fake i mean the lies are so ridiculous that it's like they're writing it
[02:18:32.920 --> 02:18:37.640]  to be discredited or something but i realized that's not what it is it's just that they've
[02:18:37.640 --> 02:18:43.080]  hired a bunch of lazy stupid people and i see what they're doing to trump and i sit there and i i see
[02:18:43.080 --> 02:18:48.280]  it because i follow the actual policy i know what's going on and the way you know they say oh the
[02:18:48.280 --> 02:18:51.800]  polish first lady wouldn't shake his hand well no they just cut the video and said she didn't
[02:18:51.800 --> 02:18:58.120]  and you know it's little stuff like that but it's a wall of lies cnn reported last saturday
[02:18:58.120 --> 02:19:04.440]  that there was no violence in germany at the g20 and then it was all peaceful i mean that every
[02:19:04.440 --> 02:19:10.600]  other news publication called it an orgy of violence i just you're a smart guy uh and and
[02:19:10.600 --> 02:19:15.800]  you know you've worked a lot of seen a lot of angles is there some method here i'm missing
[02:19:15.800 --> 02:19:22.840]  because i'm really starting to get confused uh the the method and by the way i like your uh
[02:19:22.840 --> 02:19:29.640]  your analogy to a wall this is a wall of lies that the dems the democrats and the lefties
[02:19:30.440 --> 02:19:35.560]  have built this is a wall so to speak that we don't need to be building we need to be
[02:19:35.560 --> 02:19:41.640]  tearing down the wall as reagan said tear down this wall this wall of lies and and
[02:19:41.640 --> 02:19:50.360]  falsity and so forth uh the problem is because there are so many people in our society that
[02:19:50.360 --> 02:19:54.840]  don't have the background haven't taken the time to study our system of government they don't care
[02:19:54.840 --> 02:20:01.880]  about facts uh there are huge numbers of people alex out there who actually will believe this
[02:20:01.880 --> 02:20:10.920]  nonsense that nancy polosi or chuck schumer or elizabeth warn spouts uh the problem partly is
[02:20:10.920 --> 02:20:17.480]  that if you say something whether it is true or false whether it is outrageous or rational if
[02:20:17.480 --> 02:20:25.240]  you simply say something over and over and over again uh shrilly uh such as uh elizabeth warn
[02:20:25.240 --> 02:20:30.840]  the well of the senate saying you know people will die if uh if if this healthcare plan has passed
[02:20:31.640 --> 02:20:36.840]  if you say it enough times if you say it loud enough people actually start to believe it and
[02:20:36.840 --> 02:20:44.840]  will act on it that's why it's so important to uh have you out there uh and a lot of your colleagues
[02:20:44.840 --> 02:20:52.360]  who actually believe in facts uh it's just critically important that that you're out there
[02:20:52.360 --> 02:20:59.880]  putting the light to this and tearing down this wall of uh you know the post factual world is
[02:20:59.880 --> 02:21:03.800]  as i call it well exactly they'll put false quotes in trump's mouth they'll do it to his
[02:21:03.800 --> 02:21:08.920]  sons his family anybody that supports him they'll just say yeah do you hear how this person says
[02:21:08.920 --> 02:21:12.840]  something racist and then never show the clip or they'll have tom brokow come out and say
[02:21:12.840 --> 02:21:17.080]  jones is an unalloyed racist i'm gonna i don't want to make about myself but that's what they do
[02:21:17.080 --> 02:21:21.400]  and then they don't show a clip of you saying something racist or they say jones says we have
[02:21:21.400 --> 02:21:28.040]  martian bases i never said that i don't cover ufo's they it's just a new level of lying like you said
[02:21:28.040 --> 02:21:32.200]  they know they've got a base that will believe anything they're told they'll believe that we're
[02:21:32.200 --> 02:21:37.560]  really going to kill old people if we get rid of obama care even though pocahontas and zika
[02:21:37.560 --> 02:21:43.000]  lemanuel admit it's designed to wreck the old health care that was the best in the world and
[02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:53.240]  bring in single payer i mean it's so diabolical and and it translates it it slops over from the
[02:21:53.240 --> 02:21:58.280]  media world which is bad enough because that's the basis on which a lot of people render make
[02:21:58.280 --> 02:22:04.200]  decisions and colors their view of government and the electoral process but and this we see this
[02:22:04.200 --> 02:22:11.560]  happening in uh in nevada right now uh with the the cliven bundy uh cases oh in fact you've been
[02:22:11.560 --> 02:22:15.640]  on that let's talk about that you've been really spearheading exposing that why do you think this
[02:22:15.640 --> 02:22:19.640]  is so dangerous and kind of just spend a minute or two recapping for folks what really happened
[02:22:20.760 --> 02:22:28.120]  what really happened was a simple confrontation that ended peacefully uh back in uh in april
[02:22:28.120 --> 02:22:38.120]  of 2014 uh between uh a group of americans uh who care about uh land rights who care about
[02:22:38.120 --> 02:22:43.800]  property rights who understand uh who owns what property and who cannot or does not own
[02:22:43.800 --> 02:22:51.880]  properties such as the federal government claiming that it owns uh what between 85 and 90 of all
[02:22:51.880 --> 02:22:58.520]  the land in in nevada so you had a dispute that had been in fact brewing for quite a period of time
[02:22:58.520 --> 02:23:05.640]  between uh mr bundy uh who is a rancher uh you know in several generations taking people off
[02:23:06.600 --> 02:23:15.640]  people off set known grazing rights yes and uh so the government comes in and uh wants to
[02:23:15.640 --> 02:23:21.560]  not only force him to pay uh all of this money that they claim the government claims
[02:23:21.560 --> 02:23:26.520]  is owed them because some of his cattle might have eaten a few plans on property that the
[02:23:26.520 --> 02:23:35.960]  government claims is theirs uh but uh they went beyond that and they were and did engage in actions
[02:23:35.960 --> 02:23:43.240]  to actually take some of his cattle and start killing them uh and in response to that uh the
[02:23:43.240 --> 02:23:51.160]  bundys had uh were able to have a lot of folks from not just nevada but other states uh people
[02:23:51.160 --> 02:23:55.800]  who understand what's going on out there in nevada with the bureau of land management
[02:23:56.440 --> 02:24:03.720]  uh and they came out there in support of the the bundys uh and it ended uh several days later
[02:24:03.720 --> 02:24:11.480]  in april of 2014 no shots were fired uh but i think the problem alex uh they then gave rise to
[02:24:11.480 --> 02:24:19.000]  the indictments that the government issued in early 2016 against uh not only the bundys but uh
[02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:24.520]  i think there were 19 defendants that the government uh brought indictment and now we've got fbi
[02:24:24.520 --> 02:24:31.640]  agents getting indicted for shooting people in cold blood it's just escalating it it is uh i mean
[02:24:31.640 --> 02:24:38.280]  i'm sure you remember as a lot of your listeners probably do uh the way they went after uh senator
[02:24:38.280 --> 02:24:46.520]  ted stevens up in alaska uh falsifying information improper relations between fbi agents and certain
[02:24:46.520 --> 02:24:54.120]  witnesses uh this is this is the deep state uh with a vengeance what they're doing uh to the
[02:24:54.120 --> 02:25:00.040]  bundys what they tried to do to uh senator ted steven uh and so this is where the rubber meets the
[02:25:00.040 --> 02:25:05.480]  road you've got areas like nevada where they say 90 of the land uh is government other areas out west
[02:25:05.480 --> 02:25:10.520]  on average it's like 60 and a lot of these feds this is really where there is corruption they
[02:25:10.520 --> 02:25:14.840]  come their own little boss hogs and start making side business deals and now it didn't matter if
[02:25:14.840 --> 02:25:20.280]  you've been grazing on this land since before it was even a territory 1877 doesn't matter the public
[02:25:20.280 --> 02:25:24.840]  doesn't understand law doesn't understand grazing rights doesn't understand surface rights we're just
[02:25:24.840 --> 02:25:29.640]  saying get your cattle off of here and then you know having feds start shooting little kids off the
[02:25:29.640 --> 02:25:36.680]  bikes and just really arrogant because the feds are trying to hire arrogant social justice warriors
[02:25:36.680 --> 02:25:42.040]  to be blm so there's a little bit of pushback so then they shoot you know an innocent guy who's
[02:25:42.040 --> 02:25:46.360]  unarmed getting out of his truck and now it escalates and and and so we're now to this point
[02:25:48.440 --> 02:25:55.240]  and if it uh if it is allowed to continue and hopefully at some point uh president
[02:25:55.240 --> 02:26:01.640]  trump who spoke about these issues including specifically the problems between uh blm bryor
[02:26:01.640 --> 02:26:08.760]  of land management and private citizens landowners ranchers and so forth uh mr trump spoke about this
[02:26:08.760 --> 02:26:18.280]  uh during the campaign back in 2016 uh hopefully we will see uh some of those ideas that mr trump
[02:26:18.280 --> 02:26:24.360]  had and spoke about during the campaign in support of property rights and uh against the i was about
[02:26:24.360 --> 02:26:31.720]  to say defund a lot of the blm put in new directors in the imperious attitude and bent but also you
[02:26:31.720 --> 02:26:35.080]  know they oh don't give away the national parks forget the national parks that's a small part
[02:26:35.080 --> 02:26:40.360]  we need to start privatizing these areas and you know doing it judiciously but that's where our boom
[02:26:40.360 --> 02:26:46.600]  economy comes from is is actually going in all over this country and freeing up the land i mean
[02:26:46.600 --> 02:26:52.360]  the feds as you know in texas have declared tens of thousands of square miles in oklahoma and texas
[02:26:52.360 --> 02:26:58.120]  on the red river we're talking totally owned branches with no federal connections and the feds
[02:26:58.120 --> 02:27:03.800]  show up and declare two three miles on both sides of the red river and just start taking at gunpoint
[02:27:03.800 --> 02:27:08.760]  people's property i mean it's out of control and if you see any signs as a real activist
[02:27:08.760 --> 02:27:14.280]  former congressman bob bar uh of of trump being able to slow this because we know the bureaucracy
[02:27:14.280 --> 02:27:20.520]  has been an open mutiny against him i saw i certainly hope that we see some real movement on
[02:27:20.520 --> 02:27:27.160]  this pretty quickly i know some of his early uh executive orders and other documents that president
[02:27:27.160 --> 02:27:33.800]  trump signed uh in the first couple of months of uh of his uh being sworn in as president they did
[02:27:33.800 --> 02:27:41.160]  move us in the direction of reducing the regulatory burdens on the citizens and businesses of this
[02:27:41.160 --> 02:27:47.800]  country but it's now at the point where we need to see some some real action whether it's what do
[02:27:47.800 --> 02:27:55.480]  you recommend as a former prosecutor u.s attorney businessman what do you recommend well in in the
[02:27:55.480 --> 02:28:02.760]  the case that is brewing that is going on right now in nevada uh the government should do what it
[02:28:02.760 --> 02:28:09.480]  never likes to do and that is to admit a mistake uh and dismiss the the indictments
[02:28:10.760 --> 02:28:15.800]  you the government doesn't like to that i think i think one of the main problems alex with regard
[02:28:15.800 --> 02:28:23.960]  to the uh the bundy case out in out in nevada is the fact that the government uh uh basically
[02:28:23.960 --> 02:28:30.120]  was forced to back down in the face of you know the citizens standing up to the government and
[02:28:30.120 --> 02:28:35.880]  they were in the wrong i mean these were these were law abiding citizens pushed too far they were
[02:28:35.880 --> 02:28:42.040]  they were they were uh american citizens uh who had every right to be there uh some of them
[02:28:42.040 --> 02:28:48.840]  were exercise in their second amendment rights and now uh i think to a large extent simply because
[02:28:48.840 --> 02:28:55.560]  the government was embarrassed that it that it did have to back down they turn around months later
[02:28:55.560 --> 02:29:04.840]  and issue uh indictments against 19 individuals and not only that alex but they they uh refuse to
[02:29:04.840 --> 02:29:12.040]  discuss bond uh the judge uh you know went along with that so yeah you have mr bundy and his sons
[02:29:12.040 --> 02:29:16.440]  and all these other folks locked up like they're in north korea i know you've got to go and i've
[02:29:16.440 --> 02:29:21.240]  got an exclusive piece on megan kelly's deception but if you can i'd like you to come back for five
[02:29:21.240 --> 02:29:25.720]  minutes put a bow on this a former congressman bob bar liberty guard because i want to briefly get into
[02:29:25.720 --> 02:29:30.760]  laptop bombs tsa something you're an expert on the liberty guard and then briefly your advice
[02:29:30.760 --> 02:29:34.600]  to president trump because i know some of what we talk about gets to him uh you know occasionally
[02:29:34.600 --> 02:29:39.320]  he calls but the point is he does listen so those people listen what you would do is somebody that's
[02:29:39.320 --> 02:29:44.120]  you know really been there to advise the president to weather this whole fake russia gate storm
[02:29:44.120 --> 02:29:47.000]  we'll be back with congressman bob bar former congressman alex jones

[02:33:21.320 --> 02:33:27.480]  in Nevada some of the other states are like 75 80 plus percent federal and then the feds act like
[02:33:27.480 --> 02:33:33.000]  they own everything else and i mean i've seen the arrogant armed police out west and i've seen
[02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:37.240]  them even at big bend in texas where i've been going almost every year my whole life i've been
[02:33:37.240 --> 02:33:41.960]  down to big bend 40 something times and they are rude you'll see a cop walking out one of these
[02:33:41.960 --> 02:33:52.680]  uh uh you know federal uh armed uh park rangers and they are just super arrogant and then a lot of
[02:33:52.680 --> 02:34:00.120]  the normal rangers are super liberal super sjw and they're there to let you know you're lucky to even
[02:34:00.120 --> 02:34:03.640]  be here because you're bad for the earth you're bad for the environment and i thought you know i
[02:34:03.640 --> 02:34:08.760]  gotta chip on my shoulder maybe i'm gonna go over and talk to more of these armed police i see at
[02:34:08.760 --> 02:34:15.400]  big bend when i see them and they were just almost all of them super super arrogant super aggressive
[02:34:15.960 --> 02:34:19.480]  and i don't want to get into some bashing fest here i'm not black lives matter or something
[02:34:19.480 --> 02:34:24.680]  i don't see that from the average cop state police fbi you name it in fact on average they're the
[02:34:24.680 --> 02:34:29.240]  nicer folks in the public and and more dedicated and hardworking in general there's problems everywhere
[02:34:29.240 --> 02:34:35.320]  but with these particular blm and armed rangers they are very arrogant former congressman bob bar
[02:34:35.320 --> 02:34:40.680]  former u.s attorney what do you think's happening in this culture or do you disagree with me
[02:34:41.800 --> 02:34:45.240]  i don't disagree as a matter of fact i agree with what you've just been saying
[02:34:46.120 --> 02:34:52.920]  and it's it's not so much a problem with individual officers particularly local
[02:34:53.720 --> 02:35:00.280]  law enforcement i've worked back when i was u.s attorney here in georgia for a number of years
[02:35:00.280 --> 02:35:07.000]  and both as a member of congress and even as a private attorney i've worked with uh
[02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:12.600]  so many fine men and women who are our law enforcement officers here in georgia and other
[02:35:12.600 --> 02:35:19.160]  states uh they understand by and large the line officers understand what the proper role of law
[02:35:19.160 --> 02:35:26.040]  enforcement is they understand what the constitution and our bill of rights says uh the problem is
[02:35:26.040 --> 02:35:32.920]  with the arrogance of a lot of federal agencies including alex some of these smaller agencies
[02:35:33.800 --> 02:35:41.400]  a number of folks that work in whether it's blm or the regulators fishing wildlife i mean
[02:35:41.400 --> 02:35:48.200]  firearms swat teaming people over a barn they build i mean it's just crazy oh it's uh it is
[02:35:48.200 --> 02:35:55.640]  and far too often uh it ends in a tragedy sending a swat team out for example as fair
[02:35:55.640 --> 02:36:01.960]  facts uh virginia it does uh perhaps even as a matter of routine now sending a swat team out to
[02:36:01.960 --> 02:36:09.640]  serve uh a warrant in a white collar crime case or a domestic case uh can lead to tragedy
[02:36:10.360 --> 02:36:15.560]  we have too many swat teams we have too much a military weaponry in the hands of local law
[02:36:15.560 --> 02:36:24.760]  enforcement and this has given rise to a mentality uh that is more in tune with our militaries of
[02:36:24.760 --> 02:36:30.760]  course a conduct overseas which is very different as it should be from law enforcement domestic
[02:36:30.760 --> 02:36:34.680]  that law enforcement not kill people in break days law enforcement's not kill people in break
[02:36:34.680 --> 02:36:39.240]  things and that segues into where you've been on the groping of the genitals of the kids the naked
[02:36:39.240 --> 02:36:45.160]  body scanners you drudge info wars our listeners have spearheaded the last decade trying to curtail
[02:36:45.160 --> 02:36:50.360]  the tsa and i don't want to demonize the average person but i mean it's congress it's it's it's
[02:36:50.360 --> 02:36:55.880]  all of us letting this happen but regardless the tsa they let in radical muslims they don't vet them
[02:36:55.880 --> 02:37:03.000]  they're 99 of the terrorism meanwhile they admit that 94 percent the average is like 92 nationally
[02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:10.360]  in minnesota it's 94 percent uh of contraband guns bombs drugs get through this is pointless
[02:37:10.360 --> 02:37:16.440]  we need to target people that are felons target people that are jihadis target people that are
[02:37:16.440 --> 02:37:21.960]  in public databases not illegal surveillance that say they're for jihad these are the people
[02:37:21.960 --> 02:37:28.360]  that when their id goes through get searched not my children not my not my you know eight-year-old
[02:37:28.360 --> 02:37:35.640]  daughter and and you see it all the time just yesterday for example alex i was flying uh back
[02:37:35.640 --> 02:37:44.120]  from las vegas back home to atlanta and uh is i'm i i go through the tsa precheck which usually
[02:37:44.120 --> 02:37:51.400]  works fairly well but more uh you know increasingly uh i'm being stopped for a oh a random check so
[02:37:51.400 --> 02:37:57.960]  i've got to go over and you know go through uh you know their x-ray nonsense but as i was sitting
[02:37:57.960 --> 02:38:03.880]  on the bench after going through all of this putting my my cowboy boots back on i watched
[02:38:04.840 --> 02:38:13.400]  an elderly lady who obviously was not only elderly but in poor health she was in a wheelchair
[02:38:13.400 --> 02:38:20.680]  uh being forced to stand up which was very difficult for stand there have her arms you know go through
[02:38:20.680 --> 02:38:27.080]  the whole you know the the rope being the padding down and and and so forth and as i was watching
[02:38:27.080 --> 02:38:32.280]  that and watching some of the other lines you see all sorts of people coming through including
[02:38:32.280 --> 02:38:37.880]  i would have to tell you a number that may very well fit the criteria for a person that
[02:38:37.880 --> 02:38:44.840]  that does need to be looked at but here they are spending all of this time with elderly elderly
[02:38:44.840 --> 02:38:53.000]  women elderly people who have health problems who are in wheelchairs and not only is it embarrassing
[02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:59.880]  and demeaning and frequently very physically uncomfortable for these elderly citizens but
[02:38:59.880 --> 02:39:08.280]  it's taking away uh what really needs to be done and that is to use common sense use intelligence
[02:39:08.280 --> 02:39:15.720]  information that that we have uh in looking for people who actually do potentially pose a threat
[02:39:15.720 --> 02:39:19.880]  that's what that's exactly not go further if you're not a citizen and you're on some jihad
[02:39:19.880 --> 02:39:29.560]  side can kill people and bomb people deport them absolutely uh and you know this this sanctuary
[02:39:29.560 --> 02:39:35.480]  city nonsense i think that if i'm not mistaken uh attorney general sessions uh was in nevada
[02:39:35.480 --> 02:39:42.440]  yesterday uh and speaking and and addressing this you know this sanctuary city nonsense that has
[02:39:42.440 --> 02:39:47.160]  that has come up i'm very good and again i can't go to mexico and overstay my visa you can't go to
[02:39:47.160 --> 02:39:51.480]  china and do it i mean this is just what you have a country we need to make it easy for good people
[02:39:51.480 --> 02:39:55.640]  to come here not just be walked all over i've got the meg and kelly piece coming up in a few
[02:39:55.640 --> 02:40:01.800]  minutes but let me just briefly ask you i mean honestly grading trump you know i wish uh he could
[02:40:01.800 --> 02:40:07.480]  ram through the tax cuts he's trying obviously uh you know uh he's not perfect on every issue i've
[02:40:07.480 --> 02:40:12.360]  actually impressed by how much he's gotten done what is your view of trump overall and just any
[02:40:12.360 --> 02:40:20.920]  advice you give him bob barn uh certainly uh he is far better than the alternative uh and i've
[02:40:20.920 --> 02:40:26.840]  been very impressed with his grasp of the issues for example a lot of the regulatory and fiscal
[02:40:26.840 --> 02:40:33.240]  issues but i've also been impressed with the statements that he's made with regard to uh
[02:40:33.800 --> 02:40:38.760]  you know not prosecuting people in this country not using the power of the federal government
[02:40:38.760 --> 02:40:47.640]  to prosecute people uh for uh you know crimes that aren't really crimes uh and i'd like to i'd
[02:40:47.640 --> 02:40:54.120]  like to see more of that uh it's very important for the president to lay out these issues uh
[02:40:54.120 --> 02:41:01.240]  as a policy matter but we need to see some real action in terms of the prioritization by the
[02:41:01.240 --> 02:41:09.560]  department of justice uh and these other agencies as well i totally agree and we have seen the
[02:41:09.560 --> 02:41:15.560]  democrats make stuff up and and have hashtag kill republicans and celebrates police being shot and
[02:41:15.560 --> 02:41:20.520]  all this other craziness all we're asking trump to do is do his job take the gloves off with all
[02:41:20.520 --> 02:41:24.440]  the crimes they've committed and they're gonna say he's a tyrant but but but they're the tyrants
[02:41:24.440 --> 02:41:30.520]  and i i'm not a police state guy i'm not a throw the book you know at people but they're escalating
[02:41:30.520 --> 02:41:36.360]  and and when we've got to deal with this seditious force the democrats know they're becoming a coastal
[02:41:36.360 --> 02:41:41.400]  party of communists and and their new wells and so they're fighting to overthrow our system and our
[02:41:41.400 --> 02:41:46.120]  country faces a clear and present danger and so as they commit suicide politically we need to
[02:41:46.120 --> 02:41:49.720]  restrain them they want to kill themselves politically that's their business they just
[02:41:49.720 --> 02:41:54.840]  can't take us down with them liberty guard dot org bob bar dot org bob bar thank you as always for
[02:41:54.840 --> 02:41:59.720]  coming on thank you and look forward to it again soon alan you bet there he goes i wanted to get
[02:41:59.720 --> 02:42:03.640]  him on just about you know the background all the rest of a really smart former congressman
[02:42:04.280 --> 02:42:08.440]  really great guy who does have the will to go after people he he started the impeachment
[02:42:08.440 --> 02:42:14.120]  with david shippers and others uh of those folks and so he's definitely got the courage it takes
[02:42:14.120 --> 02:42:18.520]  now we're gonna dump out a version later that actually has subtitles on this because some of
[02:42:18.520 --> 02:42:22.040]  the audio is not as clear as it could be because we were recording it from about 15 feet away and
[02:42:22.040 --> 02:42:27.720]  the room was echoey but we're gonna have more of this bigger pieces next week but this is just the
[02:42:27.720 --> 02:42:34.120]  opening salvo this is just the beginning of our rollout educating the public about how fake news
[02:42:34.120 --> 02:42:39.400]  works and so megan kelly thought that she would destroy us in free speech uh nbc thought they
[02:42:39.400 --> 02:42:44.280]  would do that well they found out the world is awake to them so here is an exclusive first
[02:42:44.280 --> 02:42:51.960]  excerpt from behind the scenes with megan kelly is there as you expand your business right if
[02:42:51.960 --> 02:42:58.360]  others do very well and expand from horrible people for four hours on the air i don't hold an
[02:42:58.360 --> 02:43:04.920]  odd inertia i'm all about businesses but we're in a war and if i probably think the truck's picked
[02:43:04.920 --> 02:43:08.440]  up it's the fact that the mainstream media is the enemy does work for far and we blow out
[02:43:08.440 --> 02:43:13.880]  this multi-national interest uh that many cases get massive taxpayer money my nbc has gotten
[02:43:13.880 --> 02:43:19.400]  for decades with tens of billions of dollars through its uh different defense uh sections and
[02:43:19.400 --> 02:43:25.800]  and and other programs uh and so i am just so proud of the fact that the republic is hiding back
[02:43:25.800 --> 02:43:30.440]  as hard as we can we're not perfect we're trying to get it right the public doesn't trust the media
[02:43:30.440 --> 02:43:35.160]  nothing to put that back together again and we're going to destroy the republic and so i'm just really
[02:43:35.160 --> 02:43:41.480]  really excited about that and we are expanding our information warfare operations using the truth
[02:43:41.480 --> 02:43:45.800]  and when we make mistakes we correct it because the truth is what's key and that we're in a fight
[02:43:45.800 --> 02:43:50.120]  for our lives in the fight for the century we're going to go all the way over to win we're never
[02:43:50.120 --> 02:43:54.520]  going to stop never going to surrender whatever the cost may be we'll go on to the end oh church
[02:44:00.840 --> 02:44:06.520]  i knew megan kelly was lying to me i knew it was going to be a jump cut highly edited piece of
[02:44:06.520 --> 02:44:12.600]  disinformation an excuse for the media to bait me for weeks beforehand misrepresenting what i'd
[02:44:12.600 --> 02:44:18.040]  said in the past it was an attempt to assassinate the new independent media it was an attempt by the
[02:44:18.040 --> 02:44:24.840]  old dinosaur press that had been fully discredited to try to somehow come back from the dead by
[02:44:24.840 --> 02:44:31.880]  demonizing a straw man of alex jones that didn't really exist in the real world but i had no idea
[02:44:31.880 --> 02:44:37.720]  how hard megan kelly would fall on her face because the american people had completely broken with
[02:44:37.720 --> 02:44:44.440]  msm a long time ago it was only the executives at nbc and megan kelly that hadn't figured it out yet
[02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:51.080]  america and the world doesn't trust them and hates them the general public rejected the
[02:44:51.080 --> 02:44:58.920]  bullying and lies they tuned in at record low numbers and since then her fall has only accelerated
[02:45:00.600 --> 02:45:05.480]  and the fall of msm doesn't stop with megan kelly cnn and many other news channels have
[02:45:05.480 --> 02:45:11.800]  gone from low ratings to almost zero ted koppel was brought out of retirement to do a so-called
[02:45:11.800 --> 02:45:17.880]  interview with sean hannity they interviewed him for close to an hour but edited it down
[02:45:17.880 --> 02:45:25.800]  to only 70 seconds of unrecognizable lies you may remember just a few months ago back in march
[02:45:25.800 --> 02:45:31.880]  i was the focus of fake edited news i had agreed to do an interview with cbs and their sunday morning
[02:45:31.880 --> 02:45:36.840]  program and their special contributor ted koppel the interview lasted nearly 50 minutes
[02:45:36.840 --> 02:45:42.280]  as we discussed in great detail great specificity many many things why there's such a great divide
[02:45:42.280 --> 02:45:49.640]  in america politics and media the interview airs i get 70 seconds of that interview cut down afterwards
[02:45:49.640 --> 02:45:55.560]  i called for cbs to release the full video which of course they refused to do so it made sense
[02:45:55.560 --> 02:46:01.400]  when hannity agreed that nbc should release the full interview or at least large portions of it
[02:46:01.400 --> 02:46:06.840]  on their site so the public could see what i really said out of the hours of video apparently they
[02:46:06.840 --> 02:46:13.000]  taped mbc only aired a few minutes of it now jones has called for mbc to release the full unedited
[02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:18.280]  version of the interview and by the way in this case i have to agree whether you agree or disagree
[02:46:18.280 --> 02:46:24.760]  with them this is the right thing to do i do believe mbc news should release the tapes the full
[02:46:24.760 --> 02:46:29.880]  tapes of the alex jones interview let americans decide isn't that what websites are now for
[02:46:29.880 --> 02:46:36.280]  or shouldn't mbc let you the american public see everything that was said and then they can decide
[02:46:36.280 --> 02:46:42.680]  for themselves what to think first tonight our report on the incendiary radio host alex jones
[02:46:43.400 --> 02:46:48.440]  so far that hasn't happened so we're about to release the first group of excerpts from the
[02:46:48.440 --> 02:46:54.040]  kelly interview where i told her bottom line you've already failed and you will be defeated
[02:46:54.040 --> 02:47:00.440]  because america and the world is awake to your lies onscreen is an image of the unedited timeline
[02:47:00.440 --> 02:47:06.760]  where nbc took totally unrelated comments questions on different topics and mix them together
[02:47:06.760 --> 02:47:12.040]  this is one of the dirtiest tricks you can play in fake news in this first section we're going to
[02:47:12.040 --> 02:47:18.520]  look how meghan kelly and nbc deceptively edited out the entire discussion of seth rich that was
[02:47:18.520 --> 02:47:23.400]  the point of the question and then connected the question to something completely different
[02:47:23.400 --> 02:47:28.920]  this is classical manipulation not just where you edit down the answer but where the answer
[02:47:28.920 --> 02:47:34.440]  is connected to something that is an entirely different topic i'll give you an example uh one
[02:47:34.440 --> 02:47:39.880]  of your reporters jay studied reporting on the seth rich case and said he had not spoken with seth
[02:47:39.880 --> 02:47:45.720]  rich's family nor those investigating the seth rich case how is that reporting
[02:47:47.560 --> 02:47:52.920]  well if you're reporting on boil down some analysis of other reporting that's something
[02:47:52.920 --> 02:47:57.480]  completely different so i wasn't there right now it's in here but you did it so i take on
[02:47:57.480 --> 02:48:05.000]  speech at that point um we sit there constantly and then we go out and do mail street interviews
[02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:09.480]  i mean would you call that recording to get the sensual people and and then you know we don't stage
[02:48:09.480 --> 02:48:14.360]  fake news with fake actors like in the mainstream media has been caught doing or no fake news they
[02:48:14.360 --> 02:48:20.360]  claim their own location are not real but you submit as fact thanks to the audience that you
[02:48:20.360 --> 02:48:26.680]  have not confirmed this fact no i don't think that's the case yet and what we made is that's
[02:48:26.680 --> 02:48:33.960]  for no traction so i'm just trying to get you're very critical of the media and and yet and you
[02:48:33.960 --> 02:48:38.120]  hold yourself out as a news organization and yet you do not seem to require the same high
[02:48:38.120 --> 02:48:44.440]  standards of the world reporters that you would ask of the mainstream media yeah i mean you talk
[02:48:44.440 --> 02:48:48.840]  about high standards for media i know the media these are Facebook's long rest of it but i mean you
[02:48:48.840 --> 02:48:55.640]  don't get general we 95 percent what we cover is looking at a news article and then you know
[02:48:55.640 --> 02:49:04.360]  discussing so didn't sit there and say that we're looking at the seventh race case uh you know

[02:55:38.200 --> 02:55:43.240]  talk to us because we're going to be conducting interviews we want to know what the mainstream
[02:55:43.240 --> 02:55:48.200]  media is not willing to show how could you talk to these bitter clingers i mean these are subhuman
[02:55:48.200 --> 02:55:52.440]  filth according to obama the democrats these are the trash of the earth these are the enemies that
[02:55:52.440 --> 02:56:00.600]  need to be dealt with well you know the mainstream media likes to call us deplorables bigots racist
[02:56:00.600 --> 02:56:07.400]  every horrible name under the zone so remember if you're hispanic black human mixed purple skin
[02:56:07.400 --> 02:56:12.600]  green skin you know even if you're from mars or pluto come to the event tell us what you think of
[02:56:12.600 --> 02:56:16.840]  flyover country tell us what you think of those statements tell us what your stories are about
[02:56:16.840 --> 02:56:19.960]  whether you're for trump against trump you know we never find folks that are against trump it'll
[02:56:19.960 --> 02:56:26.360]  actually talk exactly they just scream russia russia kill kill that's right and sometimes it's hard
[02:56:26.360 --> 02:56:31.640]  in places um liberal areas like even austin on the streets you know you go and talk to people and
[02:56:31.640 --> 02:56:40.200]  they get triggered they can't handle it they go berserk on you so we want to actually talk to
[02:56:40.200 --> 02:56:45.240]  flyover america and if you're ever wondering why they call it flyover america it's because all the
[02:56:45.240 --> 02:56:52.440]  coastal dwelling uh progressives like to sit there and call middle america flyover america
[02:56:52.440 --> 02:56:57.240]  because they think they're too good to drive through and visit your states and visit you
[02:56:57.240 --> 02:57:01.640]  they would rather snub their nose and fly over and pay five times more for their houses or
[02:57:01.640 --> 02:57:04.600]  apartments to have the state run their kids and i'm not against people you know they're
[02:57:04.600 --> 02:57:09.320]  in beautiful northern california so they're california or or again or you know all you know
[02:57:09.320 --> 02:57:14.600]  also the east coast great places it's the elites that hate their own people and hate flyover but it
[02:57:14.600 --> 02:57:20.920]  shows their erics it really does and we're going to be talking to the coal miner that lost his job
[02:57:20.920 --> 02:57:27.240]  we're going to be talking to the the person who was working in manufacturing and how they now have
[02:57:27.240 --> 02:57:32.920]  hope because trump is bringing back jobs we're just going to be talking to your everyday americans
[02:57:32.920 --> 02:57:38.440]  the the silent majority out there that feels strongly that the government these politicians
[02:57:38.440 --> 02:57:43.960]  and the leftist media has completely but msn always says we shouldn't give a voice to middle
[02:57:43.960 --> 02:57:49.000]  america or trump supporters these are bad people are you even allowed as the federal election
[02:57:49.000 --> 02:57:54.440]  commission even let you talk to flyover country i don't think they're even allowed to talk well
[02:57:54.440 --> 02:58:01.560]  yeah that's exactly it they paint all of flyover country as a bunch of kkk racists and if you actually
[02:58:01.560 --> 02:58:09.320]  were to look and see you would see that the uh racist population the actual population of kkk
[02:58:09.320 --> 02:58:14.760]  out there is extremely small sure i mean it's all it's a way to demonize this they've got a

[03:00:41.000 --> 03:00:47.400]  true vibrant diversity but globalism says it celebrates diversity by turning everyone
[03:00:47.400 --> 03:00:52.040]  against each other and then policing the different divided groups millie weaver
[03:00:52.040 --> 03:00:57.960]  is going to travel with her intrepid crew through the midwest through the south up into the east
[03:00:57.960 --> 03:01:02.680]  hitting a lot of the flyover country states that actually went for trump who normally go democrat
[03:01:02.680 --> 03:01:08.360]  or on the borderline and we've they've launched a facebook flyover america you put that into the
[03:01:08.360 --> 03:01:13.480]  search engine you can go like it right there and then stay in contact with the videos they're
[03:01:13.480 --> 03:01:16.440]  going to be posting there they're also going to be posting them obviously to our main facebook
[03:01:16.440 --> 03:01:20.280]  and our main twitter but remember they're not really our facebook our twitter we're using it
[03:01:20.280 --> 03:01:25.880]  while they still let us but flyover america a few days ago they had this idea i'm asking
[03:01:25.880 --> 03:01:30.440]  you are there a name yet boom there it is on screen that's right i thought the russians give us
[03:01:30.440 --> 03:01:35.640]  our orders then has to percolate down no actually our crew takes action themselves so that's what's
[03:01:35.640 --> 03:01:39.880]  great about it uh so what else you're looking forward to do in flyover country well we're looking
[03:01:39.880 --> 03:01:45.080]  forward to just basically going and talking to flyover america you know if you actually think
[03:01:45.080 --> 03:01:50.200]  about it when you see the interviews that the mainstream media has done talking to trump
[03:01:50.200 --> 03:01:55.320]  supporters or bitter clingers so to speak they always chop it up edit it a bunch just like the
[03:01:55.320 --> 03:02:00.920]  meghan kelly interview and they paint them in a way that's untruthful it's it's not who they really
[03:02:00.920 --> 03:02:05.960]  are so that's what we want to do we want to kind of dispel all of the the rumors saying that these
[03:02:05.960 --> 03:02:11.240]  people are bigots that they're racist they're xenophobics homophobics they're that they're
[03:02:11.240 --> 03:02:15.800]  horrible people when in reality there's a lot of people out there that are just really good
[03:02:15.800 --> 03:02:21.000]  hardworking americans and we want them to tell their story this is your opportunity to go out there
[03:02:21.000 --> 03:02:27.000]  and tell your story so make sure you follow us at flyover states of america on facebook because
[03:02:27.000 --> 03:02:31.240]  we're going to be putting the events of the locations where you guys can come meet up with us
[03:02:31.240 --> 03:02:34.120]  to tell your story and let's expand on that
[03:02:34.120 --> 03:02:40.680]  it's your idea to go show they're human we know they are our audience knows
[03:02:40.680 --> 03:02:43.640]  i don't think we're going to reach a lot of the left they they just want to feel good about
[03:02:43.640 --> 03:02:47.960]  themselves and be like nazis you know the demonizing humanized people i also want to show
[03:02:48.520 --> 03:02:55.080]  how we've got all the hollywood and media demonizing flyover and saying horrible things about people
[03:02:55.080 --> 03:02:59.160]  and being really really nasty i think each new episode a lot of us can be live i know
[03:02:59.160 --> 03:03:03.320]  should just start with the intro they're putting together showing all the nasty things
[03:03:03.320 --> 03:03:07.640]  that have been said about flyover country and again implying it's all white people too as if
[03:03:07.640 --> 03:03:12.280]  whites are inherently bad but isn't it funny out of new york out of la out of the west and east
[03:03:12.280 --> 03:03:17.960]  coast who we're not in competition with when we think has a lot of great things people are fleeing
[03:03:17.960 --> 03:03:23.880]  those areas to come to flyover country not that we're that good but just that the area under
[03:03:23.880 --> 03:03:28.360]  the cultural marxist is that bad that's right the cities are horrible i mean if you look at
[03:03:28.360 --> 03:03:34.680]  detroit you look at chicago you look at even downtown la how many homeless people they have
[03:03:34.680 --> 03:03:40.520]  you look at the inner or you know cities and it's just absolute horrors people are living in
[03:03:40.520 --> 03:03:45.160]  poverty sure and also looking at flyover country the flyover country saw things go from vibrant
[03:03:45.160 --> 03:03:52.200]  to falling apart like a war zone with economic degradation so show you know the victim situation
[03:03:52.200 --> 03:03:56.840]  that flyovers gone through but it's not complaining it's fighting back so say oh you're victims
[03:03:56.840 --> 03:04:00.200]  you little trendies with all your welfare and all your free college degrees and all your
[03:04:00.200 --> 03:04:05.240]  bitching a lot of these people that stayed on the farms and stayed in the factories and stayed here
[03:04:05.240 --> 03:04:10.520]  well if you think about it think about cnn the the mainstream media most of those people are all
[03:04:10.520 --> 03:04:16.120]  living on the coastal cities they're all living around the coast and they're just representing
[03:04:16.120 --> 03:04:21.880]  the opinions of the coastal dwellers whereas the people living in flyover america they feel like
[03:04:21.880 --> 03:04:26.920]  their voices aren't heard they feel like they don't really fit inside the liberal mainstream
[03:04:26.920 --> 03:04:31.960]  media sure and they don't fit in a republican box either exactly it's classic civil war the industrialized
[03:04:31.960 --> 03:04:37.720]  north against the unindustrial agrarian south well now it's just the globalist social engineered
[03:04:37.720 --> 03:04:42.920]  megacity coastlines against everybody else exactly it's horrible but you know what that's
[03:04:42.920 --> 03:04:48.200]  why this is your guys's chance to get out there talk to us come tell us your stories exactly so that
[03:04:48.200 --> 03:04:53.400]  we can dispel the the horrible disinformation and propaganda that the mainstream media is
[03:04:53.400 --> 03:04:58.120]  perpetuating against that's right and part two of this is how is they escaped though they're trying
[03:04:58.120 --> 03:05:04.200]  to come here and recreate it here's the truth about the don jr emails there's nothing there
[03:05:04.200 --> 03:05:08.280]  but considering the seriousness in the response from the liberal media and democrats the thinking
[03:05:08.280 --> 03:05:12.440]  person must wonder why there was no such outrage when hillary clinton illegally had classified
[03:05:12.440 --> 03:05:17.480]  emails on a private server then deleted 33 000 emails then smashed your old phone with a hammer
[03:05:17.480 --> 03:05:22.760]  but what about natalia vezel nakaya don jr didn't know he was meeting her either her or rob goldstone
[03:05:22.760 --> 03:05:26.920]  lied about the premise of the meeting and if he had known her name prior to the meeting don jr
[03:05:26.920 --> 03:05:30.920]  would have known she had obama fingerprints all over her she was potentially in the country
[03:05:30.920 --> 03:05:35.320]  illegally only in the country temporarily thanks to obama's department of justice however that
[03:05:35.320 --> 03:05:39.800]  state had expired previous to her meeting don jr eight days after the meeting she was sitting next
[03:05:39.800 --> 03:05:45.000]  to obama's russian ambassador during a foreign affairs committee hearing so tim kane is obama's
[03:05:45.000 --> 03:05:50.280]  doj guilty of treason who knew she was here illegally and why no investigation into that
[03:05:50.280 --> 03:05:56.120]  vezel nakaya's alleged law firm in russia has no website no working phone and no email for info

[03:08:18.360 --> 03:08:29.960]  to the alex joneshow this is john rapaport here in the fourth hour on info wars dot com
[03:08:31.800 --> 03:08:38.040]  what a week what a couple of weeks where do we go let's talk just a little bit about
[03:08:38.040 --> 03:08:46.600]  technocracy oh is don't want to leave that out folks the machine is god that's where they're going
[03:08:46.600 --> 03:08:52.200]  what is a technocrat technocrat is somebody who thinks they're an elitist who wants to run
[03:08:53.000 --> 03:08:59.640]  society plan it you know what i mean i planned society does that get through that means you're
[03:08:59.640 --> 03:09:08.520]  in a slot i'm in a slot everybody's in a slot because people with enough power decide that's
[03:09:08.520 --> 03:09:15.560]  the way society is going to be laid out everybody has a slot and this is going to benefit everybody
[03:09:15.560 --> 03:09:22.440]  this is going to change the world for the better and we'll have peace in utopia and wonder of wonders
[03:09:23.560 --> 03:09:32.120]  and the machine is god the machine is god that's the underlying premise people think that they're
[03:09:32.120 --> 03:09:37.720]  designing computers that are actually alive don't call me crazy i'm just the messenger
[03:09:38.360 --> 03:09:44.040]  but that's one of the great themes now i'm getting an article ready for no more fake news
[03:09:44.040 --> 03:09:49.880]  sprinkled with quotes last couple of years from media outlets that are talking about well
[03:09:49.880 --> 03:09:58.760]  you know facebook has a system of bots these robots ai artificial intelligence and they're tasked with
[03:09:58.760 --> 03:10:03.880]  doing one thing or another and all of a sudden they develop their new language their secret
[03:10:03.880 --> 03:10:11.240]  language out of nowhere as if they're alive and these people believe that the machines are actually
[03:10:11.240 --> 03:10:18.040]  alive they think that this is a religion and they are the forefront of the religion and
[03:10:18.040 --> 03:10:22.760]  therefore that gives them the right to decide how you're going to live and i'm going to live
[03:10:22.760 --> 03:10:28.440]  and we're all going to live whether it's flyover country or new york or detroit or mississippi or
[03:10:29.000 --> 03:10:36.600]  wherever it is that's the grand scheme of the technocrats of the globalists who as
[03:10:36.600 --> 03:10:45.000]  patrick wittes pointed out are the same that's the agenda the globalist agenda is the technocratic
[03:10:45.000 --> 03:10:54.440]  agenda no more countries no more borders no more anything except one giant blob in which the machines
[03:10:54.440 --> 03:11:02.280]  decide who gets food who dies who eats who lives who drinks water who doesn't drink water who has
[03:11:02.280 --> 03:11:10.600]  energy who doesn't have energy that's the way it all plays out just in case you've forgotten that
[03:11:11.160 --> 03:11:19.160]  wanted to remind you about it wanted to remind you about it so we have the latest edition of the
[03:11:19.160 --> 03:11:29.160]  media crunch the media insanity of the latest russia scandal that's being built up on a
[03:11:29.160 --> 03:11:36.120]  foundation of sand and so on and so forth if you've ever talked to a russian in your entire life
[03:11:36.120 --> 03:11:43.080]  your suspect you me anybody wow you talk with a russian or somebody who once came from russia
[03:11:43.080 --> 03:11:49.720]  you must be a trader let's string you up what are these people doing what are these people
[03:11:49.720 --> 03:11:56.280]  at cnn doing what are these politicians this guy from main whatever his name is the representative
[03:11:56.280 --> 03:12:05.000]  hamhead pork ham whatever it is who is now saying you know issuing threats against trump
[03:12:05.880 --> 03:12:12.680]  don't reply got with intensity to this guy above above above above he's going to visit violence on
[03:12:12.680 --> 03:12:20.440]  trump somebody from the house of representatives turning this whole charade into what a banana
[03:12:20.440 --> 03:12:26.200]  republic that's what he really wants and the media people at cnn who keeps screaming
[03:12:26.200 --> 03:12:31.640]  and so forth and what's really going on with them well there's several things going on first of all
[03:12:32.680 --> 03:12:39.160]  when you were a kid i'm sure you played games with other kids some kind of games hopefully you went
[03:12:39.160 --> 03:12:44.200]  outside and you played but even if you were sitting in front of a computer and there was always one
[03:12:44.200 --> 03:12:52.280]  kid when he would lose he would throw a tantrum he would go crazy he would make excuses he would
[03:12:52.280 --> 03:12:56.840]  scream he would declare that you were cheating and that's the only way you could have won another
[03:12:56.840 --> 03:13:03.560]  words he could dish it out but he couldn't take it it's it's pretty basic there are certain people
[03:13:03.560 --> 03:13:10.440]  like that they can dish it out but they can't take it and when they have to take it it drives them
[03:13:10.440 --> 03:13:19.560]  that bleep crazy they cannot deal with it they go stark raving psychotic mad that's the way they are
[03:13:19.560 --> 03:13:26.280]  that's the way they are and that's the way these people are they lost an election and they threw
[03:13:26.280 --> 03:13:32.120]  a tantrum and the tantrum keeps going on and on and on and on and on in a psychotic
[03:13:32.840 --> 03:13:39.800]  vein and they're destroying themselves destroying a democratic party refusing to listen to warnings
[03:13:39.800 --> 03:13:45.320]  from their own people that they're increasingly putting themselves out of touch with american
[03:13:45.320 --> 03:13:52.600]  people they don't care they're in the middle of a psychotic meltdown tantrum because they lost a game
[03:13:54.600 --> 03:14:00.440]  and what underlies that in case you're interested in the psychology of it is if you play enough games
[03:14:00.440 --> 03:14:07.960]  and you're a normal person you lose some you win some you're always wanting to win because why not
[03:14:07.960 --> 03:14:13.800]  it's better to win it feels better than to lose but if you lose there's always another game
[03:14:13.800 --> 03:14:22.360]  and you play many many many many many games but these people have no background or experience
[03:14:22.360 --> 03:14:30.200]  in playing games when they lose it's forever they see themselves as dropping into a flaming pit of
[03:14:30.200 --> 03:14:36.760]  hell with slimy creatures that are going to devour them for all of you eternity and they go crazy
[03:14:36.760 --> 03:14:43.320]  they go psycho they go stark raving mad and that's who these people are they can't regroup
[03:14:43.320 --> 03:14:48.760]  they can't say okay look it was a horrible loss we never should have back killery it was completely
[03:14:48.760 --> 03:14:56.040]  insane but okay we lost now we have to figure out how to win the next time that's the way you play
[03:14:56.040 --> 03:15:03.320]  games but these people can't do that they simply do not have what it takes to do that they don't
[03:15:03.320 --> 03:15:10.760]  have the will the determination the commitment the energy the imagination the creativity all
[03:15:10.760 --> 03:15:18.680]  the things you need to win and to say okay we lost that one but we're coming back stronger than ever
[03:15:18.680 --> 03:15:25.640]  blah blah blah blah no they can't do that they just can't do it so they hang on they weep they moan
[03:15:25.640 --> 03:15:34.040]  they cry they gnash their teeth they scream they make threats they want to do violence it's all part
[03:15:34.040 --> 03:15:44.920]  of the breakdown the breakdown that's what they're going through they're also going through the idea
[03:15:45.560 --> 03:15:52.360]  which they hold as a sacred principle of their own lives these people that they're not good people
[03:15:53.560 --> 03:15:59.400]  inside they don't feel like they're good or they could be great or they could be
[03:15:59.400 --> 03:16:07.880]  triumphant that they could ascend to the heights of achievement in some personal way not connected
[03:16:07.880 --> 03:16:18.200]  to some group they don't have any of that in them so their only strategy is to demean all of life
[03:16:18.200 --> 03:16:26.360]  and drag it down to where they believe they are because they can't stand looking at anybody
[03:16:26.360 --> 03:16:32.680]  who seems to be rising up and i'll tell you a story about that when we get back but i want to talk

[03:23:58.040 --> 03:24:18.360]  so i was talking about the psychology of the the loonies who are
[03:24:19.400 --> 03:24:25.640]  you know the election never happened it wasn't real they go on and on and on with the story
[03:24:25.640 --> 03:24:33.800]  and everything is russia russia russia russia russia russia russia eternal enemy etc etc etc
[03:24:35.320 --> 03:24:40.840]  so i want to continue with that for a minute out front see these people are all about kindness
[03:24:40.840 --> 03:24:47.400]  and love we want to love everybody and give everything away to everybody forever freebie
[03:24:47.400 --> 03:24:56.040]  everything for everybody yes yes yes yes yes of course of course of course until they lose the game
[03:24:56.600 --> 03:25:03.000]  then they go completely psycho then that mask drops away what is in that like the election
[03:25:03.000 --> 03:25:08.360]  they lost they lost as i was saying but what is that mask that mask is their identity that's the
[03:25:08.360 --> 03:25:14.120]  thing they carry around with them on the stick this is who i am i'm loving i'm kind i'm wonderful
[03:25:14.120 --> 03:25:19.080]  and so when see so when they lose the game that they're playing like the election
[03:25:21.320 --> 03:25:29.080]  suddenly that stick with the wonderfulness on it dripping marshmallows and globs of
[03:25:29.720 --> 03:25:36.360]  kindness and so forth doesn't work anymore that's what the psychologists used to call an identity
[03:25:36.360 --> 03:25:43.480]  crisis yeah that's their identity crisis the kindness love thing didn't work it worked as long
[03:25:43.480 --> 03:25:50.120]  as they thought they were entitled as long as they thought that victory was guaranteed as long as
[03:25:50.120 --> 03:25:55.720]  they thought the universe was speaking through them about the wonderful future that hillary clinton
[03:25:55.720 --> 03:26:04.120]  would lead us into and about so forth yes yes yes generosity just ripped from them as long as that's
[03:26:04.120 --> 03:26:13.240]  the way they saw things and they had that mask on a stick but then when they actually lost the game
[03:26:15.640 --> 03:26:22.760]  they went crazy it's very instructive i hope you get it i really do like i say when you were a
[03:26:22.760 --> 03:26:29.960]  kid you knew somebody like that i knew somebody like that we'd look at him and say there he goes
[03:26:29.960 --> 03:26:38.840]  he just lost the game look at him he's about to flip out and flip out he would well i didn't really
[03:26:38.840 --> 03:26:43.640]  lose you guys were cheating and this summer is so forth and why didn't you tell me about the
[03:26:43.640 --> 03:26:48.680]  thing in the folk forth and you see the boundary you move the boundary and you said this and then
[03:26:48.680 --> 03:27:00.920]  you're terrible you know that's right and that's just the beginning of the meltdown screening crying
[03:27:02.040 --> 03:27:13.800]  hatred pouring out like green puss yes indeedy that's the way these folks are you can see it
[03:27:13.800 --> 03:27:23.880]  playing out all the time okay that's what you should look for now i want to get into another
[03:27:23.880 --> 03:27:33.960]  piece here of the whole globalist puzzle and this involves the medical cartel the great medical
[03:27:33.960 --> 03:27:39.400]  cartel again the propaganda is the same we love everybody we're healing everybody we're curing
[03:27:39.400 --> 03:27:46.280]  everybody and we need to bring more people under this great umbrella that's what this
[03:27:46.280 --> 03:27:54.040]  supposed debate on the health care bill what's the insurance plan going to be obama care or this care
[03:27:54.040 --> 03:27:59.800]  or that care or the other and nobody even knows what the alternative really is because where's
[03:27:59.800 --> 03:28:05.640]  the text let's see the whole thing oh you don't have time for that no it's better than obama
[03:28:05.640 --> 03:28:12.520]  care no it's worse no it's better but behind that all is something else something completely insane
[03:28:12.520 --> 03:28:20.840]  which is the medical cartel and the medical system itself and before i get to the the details on it
[03:28:21.800 --> 03:28:29.720]  i want to tell you that over the past let's call it i don't know 10 years i've made a concerted
[03:28:29.720 --> 03:28:35.800]  effort to get this information out to major media knowing of course because i've been working as a
[03:28:35.800 --> 03:28:42.680]  reporter for 35 years the chances were very slim but nevertheless i wanted to see if anybody would
[03:28:42.680 --> 03:28:51.080]  pick up on it and nobody will pick up nobody will pick up on what the medical cartel is the
[03:28:51.080 --> 03:28:59.800]  havoc that they're actually wreaking on people in order to destroy and debilitate whole populations
[03:29:00.920 --> 03:29:10.360]  and who does that operation benefit who profits from that and i don't just mean dollar profits
[03:29:10.360 --> 03:29:18.600]  i'm not just talking about the pharmaceutical industry i am talking about any plan that any
[03:29:18.600 --> 03:29:29.480]  general would you know bring into being in order to conquer the enemy to conquer the enemy that's
[03:29:29.480 --> 03:29:35.560]  what we're going to talk about when this segment comes back john rapaport info wars we'll be back

[03:34:46.680 --> 03:34:57.080]  you're uh you know a general an invader of all humanity and you don't care what you caused to
[03:34:57.080 --> 03:35:04.760]  happen you're going to want to debilitate and destroy populations through every sneaky means
[03:35:04.760 --> 03:35:10.360]  possible to weaken people so they can't think straight they can't function they're in a state
[03:35:10.360 --> 03:35:17.400]  of emotional turmoil all the time and they're getting worse because their bodies are toxified
[03:35:17.400 --> 03:35:28.200]  and that's where the medical cartel comes in hello global medical cartel an essential essential
[03:35:28.200 --> 03:35:35.400]  essential piece of the globalist framework and make no mistake about it make no mistake about
[03:35:35.400 --> 03:35:43.480]  it this is about more than money sure it's about money but it's about more than money it's about
[03:35:43.480 --> 03:35:53.480]  debilitating populations so as i said before the break i decided i would do another round of
[03:35:53.480 --> 03:36:02.520]  sending out the key pieces of data on this to media outlets see what would happen and as usual
[03:36:03.240 --> 03:36:11.640]  nobody bites nobody has the courage to bite nobody was willing to take this full by the
[03:36:11.640 --> 03:36:17.960]  horns and turned it into the biggest story in the world so i'll give it to you one more time
[03:36:17.960 --> 03:36:25.480]  and i have additional citations to back this up and you can read them in my article which is titled
[03:36:25.480 --> 03:36:29.880]  something like which completely screwed up version of a health care bill do you want
[03:36:31.560 --> 03:36:38.760]  july 26 2000 journal of the american medical association a review called as us health really
[03:36:38.760 --> 03:36:44.840]  the best in the world by a revered public health expert at john's hopkins school of public health
[03:36:44.840 --> 03:36:53.480]  dr barber starfield and i cite this because it's mainstream all the way up and down the line
[03:36:53.480 --> 03:37:01.720]  everybody's credentials are just absolutely pristine mainstream and starfield's conclusion
[03:37:01.720 --> 03:37:11.560]  was that every year in the u.s the medical system kills 225 000 people that she told me in a subsequent
[03:37:11.560 --> 03:37:16.920]  interview is a conservative estimate was a conservative estimate and since then other
[03:37:16.920 --> 03:37:23.320]  studies have been done that place that figure higher and of course there are non mainstream
[03:37:23.320 --> 03:37:30.280]  investigations that place that figure much higher but we'll stick with that mainstream perfect
[03:37:30.280 --> 03:37:35.960]  nothing that mainstream media could refute and say wow this guy's on the fringe he doesn't know
[03:37:35.960 --> 03:37:41.640]  what he's talking about this is not a real investigation no this is straight ahead all the way
[03:37:42.760 --> 03:37:50.760]  okay generally american medical association dr barber starfield medical system in america kills
[03:37:50.760 --> 03:37:59.400]  we're not even getting to the maiming and the wounding kills 225 000 people a year okay so
[03:37:59.400 --> 03:38:06.920]  extrapolate that what does that mean over 10 years every 10 years in america it means the
[03:38:06.920 --> 03:38:17.480]  medical system kills 2.25 million people in america every 10 years you think that's not a story
[03:38:17.480 --> 03:38:24.120]  just talking from reporter uh you know media point of view you don't think you could build on that
[03:38:24.120 --> 03:38:29.480]  story you don't think you could pursue that mother for months and months and months on end
[03:38:29.480 --> 03:38:34.440]  and get people coming out of the woodwork confessing to crimes and prior knowledge that they knew
[03:38:34.440 --> 03:38:39.320]  all along that that's what the medical system was doing in america and they did nothing about it at
[03:38:39.320 --> 03:38:45.320]  the fda at the cdc at the department of health and human services at all leading universities
[03:38:45.320 --> 03:38:51.080]  and medical schools where they teach this kind of medicine you know to their students you will be
[03:38:51.080 --> 03:38:57.960]  practicing this and they were somehow managed to omit the fact and also by the way you'll be killing
[03:38:57.960 --> 03:39:04.360]  2.25 million people a year when you practice this kind of medicine so go out there boys and do it
[03:39:05.400 --> 03:39:11.240]  yeah they somehow omit that you don't think that the new york times if they really wanted to
[03:39:12.120 --> 03:39:18.920]  or cnn if they really wanted to couldn't build this up to the biggest story in the world
[03:39:18.920 --> 03:39:27.480]  and we're not even talking about europe and other parts of just america 2.25 million deaths every
[03:39:27.480 --> 03:39:35.960]  10 year and millions of hospitalizations every year literally millions you can check out the figures
[03:39:35.960 --> 03:39:42.680]  in my article on the the naming this is your medical cartel
[03:39:42.680 --> 03:39:53.320]  this is part and parcel of the globalist agenda this is not something that nobody knows about
[03:39:54.040 --> 03:40:02.040]  this is open knowledge in medical circles this is open knowledge at major media outlets and in
[03:40:02.040 --> 03:40:08.840]  the government and everywhere where there is any kind of power whatsoever political power
[03:40:08.840 --> 03:40:17.000]  so in 2009 about i guess it was maybe a year before she died it's a whole other story dr
[03:40:17.000 --> 03:40:23.960]  barber starfield author of this review that i'm citing i interviewed her and i asked her among
[03:40:23.960 --> 03:40:30.920]  other questions has the u.s. government to your knowledge done anything to fix this
[03:40:30.920 --> 03:40:36.920]  horrendous horrible ongoing tragedy this was an email interview and she answered with big capital
[03:40:36.920 --> 03:40:44.840]  letters and oh no has any agency of government approached you to consult with them to try to
[03:40:44.840 --> 03:40:57.880]  do something to fix this horrendous no no no no no don't forget about this folks
[03:40:59.400 --> 03:41:05.240]  there are people out there that are claiming to have knowledge of all sorts of
[03:41:05.240 --> 03:41:10.360]  horrendous activities of the government so on and so forth that are causing people to
[03:41:10.360 --> 03:41:15.560]  stress pain suffering and death and here i'm just laying out in front of you something
[03:41:15.560 --> 03:41:20.440]  that is in the open literature in of all places the journal the american medical association
[03:41:20.440 --> 03:41:26.200]  and as i say i have other citations to back this up mainstream citations
[03:41:26.200 --> 03:41:40.600]  2.25 million murders from your medical cartel per decade in the united states alone
[03:41:42.360 --> 03:41:47.560]  what do you think that does to the population come on open up your imagination think about it
[03:41:47.560 --> 03:41:54.760]  come on come on play ball with me what do you think that does cousin died the aunt died mother
[03:41:54.760 --> 03:41:59.240]  died sundae whatever we thought it was a disease but we had the snag and suspicion it was actually
[03:41:59.240 --> 03:42:03.880]  the drugs they were giving them in the hospital and the unnecessary surgery and so on and so
[03:42:03.880 --> 03:42:12.920]  forth and whatever and that family those people the co-workers of the person who's now dead
[03:42:12.920 --> 03:42:17.240]  turmoil emotional turmoil spinning out and rippling out from that
[03:42:17.240 --> 03:42:27.000]  what does that do to a population 2.25 billion deaths per decade can you get this information
[03:42:27.000 --> 03:42:35.720]  out to people here's my appeal to you because hey i'm talking to a very large audience right now
[03:42:36.920 --> 03:42:45.560]  can you get this out to people just people anybody get it out get it out around the world
[03:42:45.560 --> 03:42:50.920]  you never know what could happen if enough people get up on their hind legs and they say
[03:42:51.560 --> 03:42:57.480]  this is real this is what you're doing the medical cartel this is what you're doing and
[03:42:57.480 --> 03:43:03.400]  this has to stop if millions tens of millions hundreds of millions of people suddenly started
[03:43:03.400 --> 03:43:09.080]  screening about this who knows what might happen can you get this information out
[03:43:09.080 --> 03:43:16.920]  i think you can i really do i don't think it's a big deal i think it's just a click and a click
[03:43:16.920 --> 03:43:22.120]  and a click and a click and a put it up and you got it out i think you know people i think you
[03:43:22.120 --> 03:43:28.440]  could get this information out july 26 2000 journal of the american medical association
[03:43:28.440 --> 03:43:34.760]  dr barbara starfield is us health really the best in the world u.s medical system kills
[03:43:34.760 --> 03:43:42.440]  225 000 people a year 2.25 million per decade that's a conservative estimate
[03:43:45.160 --> 03:43:50.680]  i've even had people you know well i'm a doctor i'm a medical technician and you're
[03:43:50.680 --> 03:43:56.680]  distorting above and why am i distorting this because look at all the good the system does
[03:43:56.680 --> 03:44:03.480]  as if that were an argument right that excuses the deaths
[03:44:06.840 --> 03:44:10.040]  let's do a little logic exercise for a second here
[03:44:12.440 --> 03:44:18.440]  even if we assume the system the modern medical system let's just okay it's doing good over here
[03:44:18.440 --> 03:44:23.320]  crisis emergency medicine putting people together when they're all broken up on the road after
[03:44:23.320 --> 03:44:31.320]  auto accidents or whatever doing good over here go to therefore therefore we can write off the fact
[03:44:31.320 --> 03:44:37.960]  that they're killing 225 000 people over here as if well it's just an avoidable side effect
[03:44:37.960 --> 03:44:42.520]  you know unavoidable you know it's just one of those things that happens but you got to balance
[03:44:42.520 --> 03:44:52.680]  off this no you don't have to do anything like that to these incredible people in the past that
[03:44:52.680 --> 03:45:02.120]  have tried to convince me of this baby well you know if you're doing good over here you do good
[03:45:02.120 --> 03:45:09.720]  and then you fix the bad that's the way it works folks if you're really sincere and earnest about
[03:45:10.680 --> 03:45:15.640]  helping people you don't say well because we're doing good over there just you know one of those
[03:45:15.640 --> 03:45:25.080]  things hey we produce you know here's the analogy we produce a very good materials for building and
[03:45:25.080 --> 03:45:33.480]  so forth so if we run 500 000 tons of horrendous chemicals into rivers and so forth that's one
[03:45:33.480 --> 03:45:38.200]  of these things you know you got to play it off i mean it's like well we do good over here so you
[03:45:38.200 --> 03:45:47.480]  know you got to take the good with the bad no you don't no you don't absolutely not absolutely not
[03:45:49.320 --> 03:45:57.320]  the medical cartel that's a big one folks and you'll notice that these wonderful people
[03:45:58.440 --> 03:46:04.120]  at in mainstream media never connect all the dots they never put the story together
[03:46:04.120 --> 03:46:12.040]  they never say okay clear the decks we're going to take on the medical system and the pharmaceutical
[03:46:12.040 --> 03:46:21.160]  industry they don't for many reasons it's not just one reason or two reasons yes the pharmaceutical
[03:46:21.160 --> 03:46:27.800]  advertising money no question about it it goes up much higher on the ladder of power than that so it
[03:46:27.800 --> 03:46:38.440]  isn't just that it used to that they will not take on this story so therefore and i have to
[03:46:38.440 --> 03:46:45.400]  tip my hat here to tucker carlson at fox news because he's had robert africanity jr on twice
[03:46:45.400 --> 03:46:51.160]  now talking about the dangers of vaccines and the sinister disease control the cdc
[03:46:51.160 --> 03:47:00.440]  where you're dealing with a terminally corrupt corrupt corrupt agency of the government that
[03:47:00.440 --> 03:47:10.520]  is deceiving every day that it exists the american public as to the very real and present dangers
[03:47:10.520 --> 03:47:16.600]  and destruction that is visited upon not only americans but all over the world as a result
[03:47:16.600 --> 03:47:24.040]  of vaccines and multiple vaccines and single vaccines and all the vaccines and kennedy sat there
[03:47:24.040 --> 03:47:30.120]  with tucker carlson said i'm shocked basically that you had me on again or even the first time
[03:47:30.120 --> 03:47:36.760]  because i know how much pharmaceutical advertising money any television network runs on and carlson
[03:47:36.760 --> 03:47:42.200]  said well you know i don't see why that should stop us from having an honest con conversation
[03:47:42.200 --> 03:47:51.720]  about a very important issue okay beautiful beautiful it's a start it's something and whether
[03:47:51.720 --> 03:47:56.920]  or not kennedy actually will head up an investigation on behalf of president trump
[03:47:57.560 --> 03:48:06.760]  who has implied and said both in the past that he believes that there is a vaccine autism connection
[03:48:06.760 --> 03:48:16.840]  whether this formal investigation will come to pass we will see we will see but kennedy looks
[03:48:16.840 --> 03:48:23.800]  like he is going to proceed anyway and believe me he has already exposed enough information
[03:48:23.800 --> 03:48:30.840]  about the horrendous effects of vaccines in articles that he has written and about the cdc
[03:48:30.840 --> 03:48:44.760]  to completely torpedo this effort to destroy destroy children destroy children and babies
[03:48:44.760 --> 03:48:53.240]  with these vaccines he has and he has already expressed and exposed enough information to
[03:48:53.240 --> 03:49:01.720]  bring the house down so that's something to look for as we see what's going to happen as we move forward
[03:49:04.600 --> 03:49:10.440]  but don't forget what the medical cartel is doing and don't forget what major media are doing to
[03:49:10.440 --> 03:49:19.240]  cover that up part of their article of religious faith is faith in the medical system you see
[03:49:19.240 --> 03:49:25.000]  because again to go back to what i was saying before these media people think they hold up
[03:49:25.000 --> 03:49:30.600]  their mask of kindness and generosity and we love everybody and we want to help everybody
[03:49:30.600 --> 03:49:36.840]  and so they just widely assume that that's what the medical system does oh it's wonderful it's
[03:49:36.840 --> 03:49:43.720]  all about love and so forth and and so we support all of the science and the medicine and so forth
[03:49:43.720 --> 03:49:51.560]  you know people in the media uh with at best completely empty heads got no brains whatsoever
[03:49:51.560 --> 03:49:57.240]  can't look at information can't analyze information don't do any investigation on their own that's
[03:49:57.240 --> 03:50:03.880]  what they say about the medical system because the medical system says that about itself and
[03:50:03.880 --> 03:50:09.240]  its propaganda say oh this is the most wonderful thing in the world called modern medicine and we
[03:50:09.240 --> 03:50:14.920]  want to help everybody and so all the media reporters with their masks of being politically
[03:50:14.920 --> 03:50:20.680]  correct and generous and free be everything for everybody say well we need more research we need
[03:50:20.680 --> 03:50:26.040]  more money for more medical research we need more health care we need to put more people under the
[03:50:26.040 --> 03:50:34.520]  umbrella of the magnificent wonderful utopian system of medical care that kills 2.25 million
[03:50:34.520 --> 03:50:43.880]  people in america per decade oh yeah that's what it does that's what it does so we're winding down
[03:50:43.880 --> 03:50:52.040]  here to a break i hope you get what i'm saying here folks and get this information out from
[03:50:52.040 --> 03:50:59.960]  info wars spreading out across the planet please do it see you after the break in a minute

[03:52:05.560 --> 03:52:11.320]  their president is another hitler they use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award
[03:52:11.320 --> 03:52:16.760]  shows to repeat their narrative over and over again and then they use their ex-president to
[03:52:16.760 --> 03:52:23.880]  endorse the resistance all to make them march make them protest make them scream racism and sexism
[03:52:23.880 --> 03:52:30.280]  and xenophobia and homophobia to smash windows burn cars shut down interstates and airports
[03:52:30.280 --> 03:52:36.680]  bully and terrorize the law abiding until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs
[03:52:36.680 --> 03:52:43.480]  and stop the madness and when that happens they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage the only
[03:52:43.480 --> 03:52:51.320]  way we stop this the only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight this violence of lies

[03:54:05.560 --> 03:54:15.720]  John Rappaport back here at info wars last segment in the fourth hour
[03:54:19.720 --> 03:54:23.560]  some people are shocked you know i've presented this medical information before
[03:54:24.520 --> 03:54:28.920]  people say no that couldn't be that's impossible the figures you're citing they couldn't exist
[03:54:28.920 --> 03:54:40.680]  you know their mind goes into a kind of scramble effect way oh no no no yes yes yes yes yes yes
[03:54:41.720 --> 03:54:47.960]  and there are implications that pour right out of this idea that the medical system in america
[03:54:47.960 --> 03:54:55.240]  for example is killing 2.25 million people per decade 2.25 million yeah there are implications
[03:54:55.240 --> 03:55:03.720]  that come out of this you better believe it and one of those implications is
[03:55:05.240 --> 03:55:15.320]  that the studies that are published in major medical journals are rife with absolute rank
[03:55:16.280 --> 03:55:23.720]  stench ridden fraud not just now and then but on a regular basis and i have printed in the past
[03:55:23.720 --> 03:55:29.800]  quotes from editors at some of the most prestigious medical journals in the world the lancet for
[03:55:29.800 --> 03:55:36.520]  example ritchard horton who's the editor-in-chief uh marcia engel who a doctor who is was the
[03:55:37.080 --> 03:55:41.080]  editor of the new england journal medicine for 20 years and they're both basically saying
[03:55:41.880 --> 03:55:50.520]  you cannot rely on these studies anymore that medical information is just drenched
[03:55:50.520 --> 03:55:58.040]  and decaying and rotting with disinformation and lies and fraud well that would have to be the case
[03:55:58.040 --> 03:56:04.360]  don't you think if the medical system and in particular pharmaceutical drugs are doing all
[03:56:04.360 --> 03:56:10.920]  of this massive damage on a regular basis to life on the planet then how come we're not reading
[03:56:10.920 --> 03:56:16.200]  about it in the medical journals and instead we're reading one glowing account after another
[03:56:16.200 --> 03:56:22.120]  about some clinical trial of a new pharmaceutical that's going to change uh you know treatment
[03:56:22.120 --> 03:56:29.080]  options for patients how come how come because it's fraud it's total fraud it's not just a little
[03:56:29.080 --> 03:56:36.120]  bit of fraud it's not just a white buy or a little deceptions of what the whole thing is saturated
[03:56:36.120 --> 03:56:45.320]  with absolute fraud and that says something about the researchers themselves who are doing the
[03:56:45.320 --> 03:56:50.920]  research at the pharmaceutical companies who are developing the drugs at the university
[03:56:50.920 --> 03:56:57.880]  medical schools or the the university medical departments it spreads out and bleeds through
[03:56:57.880 --> 03:57:05.240]  the whole system you know fraud fraud fraud fraud everywhere that's what we're looking at that's
[03:57:05.240 --> 03:57:13.480]  just one of the implications of what i'm saying here it opens up a vast cavern of potential
[03:57:13.480 --> 03:57:19.880]  investigation and that's one of the things that i've been doing for the past 20 years or so now
[03:57:19.880 --> 03:57:27.000]  and documenting it and other people have been documenting it and it's time that the entire
[03:57:27.000 --> 03:57:34.760]  global population woke up to the fact of what's being done to them under this you know religion
[03:57:34.760 --> 03:57:40.200]  of the church of biological chemical pharmaceutical mysticism of the white coat
[03:57:40.200 --> 03:57:53.000]  that they realize the full extent of the damage and the destruction being visited upon them as part
[03:57:53.000 --> 03:58:05.400]  and parcel of a globalist takeover of a debilitated worn out distracted confused sick poisoned toxified
[03:58:05.400 --> 03:58:15.880]  world just telling you what's happening it is happening no doubt about it thank you for your
[03:58:15.880 --> 03:58:21.880]  attention folks it's been very interesting i'm going to see what's going to happen are you
[03:58:21.880 --> 03:58:29.320]  going to get this info out to everybody everybody around the planet because if you do we're going
[03:58:29.320 --> 03:58:39.320]  to see something happen see you next time this is john raffa port infowars
