[00:00.000 --> 00:12.440]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:12.440 --> 00:20.000]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:20.000 --> 00:27.160]  Texas Alex Jones well the Defense Secretary has come out and warned
[00:27.160 --> 00:32.120]  Israel about the consequences militarily and economically striking Iran
[00:32.120 --> 00:35.720]  you've got the British government basically saying they're getting ready
[00:35.720 --> 00:39.960]  for it but endorsing it the French government saying it's a horrible idea
[00:39.960 --> 00:46.240]  Israel saying they may strike them as early as well about 20 days from now
[00:46.240 --> 00:52.520]  the start of next month clearly they're trying to sell the attacks right now and
[00:52.520 --> 00:56.920]  we've been talking about this so long we tend to get an idea in our heads at this
[00:56.920 --> 01:07.720]  can't happen like Libya like Iraq like Afghanistan but Iran is upwards of 80
[01:07.720 --> 01:12.600]  million people and they've got a lot more high-tech weapons than Iraq had after
[01:12.600 --> 01:17.840]  decades of sanctions and ongoing bombardments and specters crawling all
[01:17.840 --> 01:23.400]  over their country and the head of their intelligence agency in fact I mentioned
[01:23.400 --> 01:29.760]  this a few days ago but it's important to get back to came out and said we are
[01:29.760 --> 01:33.560]  going to bring a street battle in fact Jeremy we repull me that article for the
[01:33.560 --> 01:36.400]  third time thanks I know you've been keep giving it to me but I keep beginning
[01:36.400 --> 01:40.760]  to actually read what he said and he said we're gonna bring street battles to
[01:40.760 --> 01:45.280]  Tel Aviv we're gonna bring it to the United States we're gonna bring it to
[01:45.280 --> 01:50.440]  Europe and so Iran is walking directly into the globalist trap because even if
[01:50.440 --> 01:55.200]  they can't carry out those asymmetrical warfare guerrilla warfare responses
[01:55.200 --> 01:59.440]  they're really a warfare the the globalists the global corporations
[01:59.440 --> 02:05.720]  playing countries off against each other will stage it will stage it and I've
[02:05.720 --> 02:09.120]  had a lot of guests on over the years and of course much of it's been
[02:09.120 --> 02:14.240]  declassified the question is is it still the case but it certainly was the case
[02:14.240 --> 02:22.400]  that the CIA and others allowed the Ayatollah Khomeini to be brought in out
[02:22.400 --> 02:31.320]  of Paris and to be put into power and then to take the hostages and then to
[02:31.320 --> 02:41.720]  blame it on Jimmy Carter and I'm no fan of Jimmy Carter he was a globalist
[02:41.720 --> 02:46.200]  trilateral commissioned person the point is this is the inner fighting with
[02:46.200 --> 02:49.640]  these grips going on and Iran counter came out in Congress where they gave
[02:49.640 --> 02:56.200]  them weapons and money off of the money that they made off selling cocaine in the
[02:56.200 --> 03:07.480]  US to basically keep the hostages and hold them till Ronald Reagan got into
[03:07.480 --> 03:13.040]  office so so all of this is admitted and you guys did print me the article but
[03:13.040 --> 03:16.320]  actually print me the original if you will thank you this is from infowars.com
[03:16.320 --> 03:19.840]  where we reposted it I want to get the original for folks Iran threatened

[03:25.920 --> 03:29.400]  hadn't seen this is where they also threatened the US that the article I
[03:29.400 --> 03:34.160]  want is Iran threatened street war in Tel Aviv the Israeli capital that's the
[03:34.160 --> 03:38.440]  one I want you found another one thank you good job I'll I will cover that when

[03:58.360 --> 04:04.040]  11 11 11 and it kind of snuck up on us oh yeah the associated press is
[04:04.040 --> 04:07.760]  reporting that they've shut down the Great Pyramid and other pyramids because
[04:07.760 --> 04:12.280]  of reports there'd be Illuminati rituals there but they're shutting it down so
[04:12.280 --> 04:16.320]  they can't have the rituals the AP reports but shutting it down is the
[04:16.320 --> 04:22.840]  way to have the rituals and by the way world leaders went in 2000 which really
[04:22.840 --> 04:27.000]  wasn't the new millennium 2001 was to the Great Pyramid it actually did weird
[04:27.000 --> 04:33.320]  rituals on TV I taped it on VHS never reared it meant to and could ever find
[04:33.320 --> 04:37.040]  it again but I know a lot of you did see it it was all these fireworks and weird
[04:37.040 --> 04:41.480]  giant TV screens with devils marching around and all these world leaders and
[04:41.480 --> 04:47.880]  it was a public Illuminati ritual and in AP reports there are rituals worldwide
[04:47.880 --> 04:53.960]  today so that's in my stack I'm gonna be getting to that coming up as well then

[08:13.440 --> 08:17.880]  friends this is going to be an unbelievably jam-packed transmission
[08:17.880 --> 08:26.360]  today it is 11 11 11 I don't put stock in numerology but from China to the
[08:26.360 --> 08:34.520]  United States from France to Mexico from Chile to Japan throughout history
[08:34.520 --> 08:40.520]  every ruling elite is obsessed with the occult and numerology and we'll ask
[08:40.520 --> 08:45.840]  David IQ study these people in depth exactly why that is and he's always
[08:45.840 --> 08:50.120]  exposed the fact that it's pedophile rings and the last hundred years at least
[08:50.120 --> 08:55.960]  that run the planet that the British Role family are really Transylvanian that
[08:55.960 --> 09:00.040]  they're a bunch of body part-eaters and now that's come out in the news that
[09:00.040 --> 09:03.680]  they're not hundreds of years ago but even more recently eating human body
[09:03.680 --> 09:10.720]  parts that they have attendance that take care of their every intimate detail
[09:10.720 --> 09:15.720]  and that they're into all sorts of sick behavior and now it Prince Charles says
[09:15.720 --> 09:18.760]  he might move to Transylvania that that's where their lineage comes from and
[09:18.760 --> 09:23.480]  on and on and on it gets more and more weird with the whole Penn State
[09:23.480 --> 09:28.680]  situation and obviously paterno has gotten criminal defense lawyers and he
[09:28.680 --> 09:37.000]  better he better because he knew about this for over a decade and did nothing
[09:37.000 --> 09:47.080]  as it was ongoing as it was ongoing this was going on since 1994 when he knew and
[09:47.080 --> 09:52.120]  the school president knew now I did reading the MSNBC headline I did some
[09:52.120 --> 09:58.120]  more research this morning it is true that the police were contacted in the
[09:58.120 --> 10:05.120]  town and the police there at the college the college police and the
[10:05.120 --> 10:11.680]  grand jury's knew as early as 2000 had hearings in 2002 2005 2008 so the whole
[10:11.680 --> 10:18.080]  group is complicit basically and that's why he may not get indicted and if they
[10:18.080 --> 10:21.360]  find out that he went to the police we don't know who went and then they didn't
[10:21.360 --> 10:25.920]  do anything I'm then he's off the hook but they all need to be brought in for
[10:25.920 --> 10:30.560]  questioning and you can't send the FBI in to do this I mean it was run by J. Edgar
[10:30.560 --> 10:37.760]  Hoover who was part of the the whole club I mean it's well documented running
[10:37.760 --> 10:42.280]  around in women's dresses and going to big orgy parties and famous witnesses
[10:42.280 --> 10:47.440]  Cone's girlfriend the famous lawyer you know reportedly saying she saw Hoover
[10:47.440 --> 10:51.560]  having sex with quote young boys you've got some of that alluded to in the new
[10:51.560 --> 10:56.440]  film coming out that Clint Eastwood's putting out reportedly the FBI kind of
[10:56.440 --> 11:00.960]  threatened him over it but that's why this has gotten so bad because these
[11:00.960 --> 11:04.800]  people get into power and they just start recruiting more and more and more
[11:04.800 --> 11:12.680]  what's that oh it is 11 11 right now but it's 11 11 24 times around the world
[11:12.680 --> 11:20.120]  today so it's 11 11 and yes they were worried I guess seven eight hours ago
[11:20.120 --> 11:24.680]  over in the Middle East and they all these weirdos were trying to get in to
[11:24.680 --> 11:28.080]  do rituals and so they said we're shutting it down but we'll have some
[11:28.080 --> 11:32.080]  contingents inside the pyramids ourselves and again I'm sure nowadays
[11:32.080 --> 11:37.880]  somebody can dig it out I saw it on PBS they did 24-hour broadcast from the
[11:37.880 --> 11:44.680]  great pyramid and they had all this weird rituals going on and they dialed to
[11:44.680 --> 11:49.120]  French TV and a national concert there where the guy in French was saying oh
[11:49.120 --> 11:52.920]  Lucifer we love you I'm sitting there watching this as they went around the
[11:52.920 --> 11:59.480]  world on PBS and I was taping it and back then it was myself my wife and maybe
[11:59.480 --> 12:03.120]  one other crew member and I never even had time to edit it get it off the VHS or
[12:03.120 --> 12:09.720]  it somebody at a PBS station has that 24-hour broadcast with I mean weird
[12:09.720 --> 12:16.840]  devil worship right on television I mean it was bizarre but here it is today
[12:16.840 --> 12:23.320]  this is out of Associated Press Egypt closes great pyramid after rumors of
[12:23.320 --> 12:28.560]  rituals but you notice the closing of it then allows the rituals and that's come
[12:28.560 --> 12:34.040]  out in the news that they allow elites in the supreme antiquities department to
[12:34.040 --> 12:38.040]  to close it down and go into it and do weird stuff and world leaders were in
[12:38.040 --> 12:41.560]  attendance in 2000 including what George Herbert Walker Bush and they were in
[12:41.560 --> 12:45.360]  religious rapture as this was happening so you can say all this is silly and
[12:45.360 --> 12:51.840]  stupid until you've been to Bohemian Grove or until you watch the footage ABC
[12:51.840 --> 12:56.560]  News Scott of Skull and Bones they're taking it deadly serious when they were
[12:56.560 --> 13:02.880]  worshiping Lucifer and doing mock human sacrifices ABC News videotape that the
[13:02.880 --> 13:07.520]  most powerful secret society in the United States undoubtedly Skull and Bones
[13:07.520 --> 13:13.120]  that is just a chapter of the Illuminati and they themselves admit that and then
[13:13.120 --> 13:17.360]  I snuck into Bohemian Grove which is a larger recruiting arm of that and watch
[13:17.360 --> 13:23.240]  them do their ritual to Moloch and and and and to do a mock human sacrifice of
[13:23.240 --> 13:28.520]  a child they claim it was mock and the old men were in rapture and were grinding
[13:28.520 --> 13:34.480]  their teeth in religious exaltation it was similar to being in a you know
[13:34.480 --> 13:38.160]  Baptist church when the preachers praying for somebody who's sick in the
[13:38.160 --> 13:42.080]  congregation but the opposite it was similar but the opposite you know that
[13:42.080 --> 13:45.200]  loving feeling of people caring and everything it was the opposite it was
[13:45.200 --> 13:50.440]  like a feeling of repine and so I was like wow this is really interesting
[13:50.440 --> 13:55.160]  like shut up oh my hands is like oh they looked at him like they're about to
[13:55.160 --> 13:58.840]  kill him as Mike snuck in with me and you know there's footage of us in that
[13:58.840 --> 14:04.020]  crowd those men just oh oh and so you can say oh it's just some stupid play
[14:04.020 --> 14:09.680]  they're doing no it's not they're deadly serious about it remember decades ago
[14:09.680 --> 14:14.640]  people warned about this people are like oh that's not going on yes it's going on
[14:14.640 --> 14:19.520]  here it is Egypt closes great pyramid after rumors of rituals Egypt's
[14:19.520 --> 14:23.440]  antiquities authority closed the largest of keys of pyramids Friday
[14:23.440 --> 14:28.760]  following rumors that groups would try to hold spiritual ceremonies on the site
[14:28.760 --> 14:37.600]  at 11 11 a.m. on November 11 2011 the authorities head Mustafa Amin said in
[14:37.600 --> 14:42.480]  a statement Friday that the pyramid also known as chiops would be closed to
[14:42.480 --> 14:46.320]  visitors until Saturday morning for necessary maintenance yes I'm sure I
[14:46.320 --> 14:50.960]  mean this is all the big big devil cult it's into these pyramids it's their
[14:50.960 --> 14:54.400]  symbol of the New World Order the closure follows a string of unconfirmed
[14:54.400 --> 14:59.440]  reports in local media that unidentified groups would try to hold Jewish or
[14:59.440 --> 15:03.800]  Masonic rights well they admit that Alistair Crowley went there and did them
[15:03.800 --> 15:08.040]  on the site to take advantage of mysterious powers coming from the
[15:08.040 --> 15:12.680]  pyramid on the rare day Amin called all reports of planned ceremonies on the site
[15:12.680 --> 15:19.320]  completely lacking in truth the complexes director Ali al as far said
[15:19.320 --> 15:23.520]  Friday the Egyptian company requested permission last month to hold an event
[15:23.520 --> 15:29.840]  called hug the pyramid which 120 people would join hands at the ancient burial
[15:29.840 --> 15:32.840]  structure yeah that's their little cute political correct thing let's just call
[15:32.840 --> 15:35.960]  it hugging the pyramid we'll all join hands and get the power off this thing
[15:35.960 --> 15:43.160]  that's what the alumnus believe pyramids given power and we'll just we'll just tell
[15:43.160 --> 15:48.240]  people it's a liberal hugging that's what the occult's all about is the general
[15:48.240 --> 15:52.000]  public not knowing what they're seeing and then they give you a cover story oh
[15:52.000 --> 15:55.640]  these are gunshot detectors were putting up all over your town under
[15:55.640 --> 15:59.480]  Homeland Security and then years later their microphones were listening to
[15:59.480 --> 16:03.800]  every word you say deputy head of the Homeland Security said you'll never know
[16:03.800 --> 16:10.640]  when we're listening or not ha ha ha again deception killing stealing
[16:10.640 --> 16:17.960]  destroying they want to watch the world burn it hit me again this morning when I
[16:17.960 --> 16:20.440]  read a particular article I'm gonna get to here in a moment that that's the
[16:20.440 --> 16:27.600]  globalist really are demon possessed I'm and again I've never been this has
[16:27.600 --> 16:30.640]  never been a heavy religious show I am a Christian I have a relationship with
[16:30.640 --> 16:35.400]  Jesus Christ but I cover the news but the more you study these people it's
[16:35.400 --> 16:39.600]  really true even if you're an atheist and don't believe in God I see atheists
[16:39.600 --> 16:43.200]  in emails saying I like your news and analysis but please stop pushing
[16:43.200 --> 16:46.680]  religion on us listen if I wanted to have a religious show I could have one on
[16:46.680 --> 16:51.040]  the weekend or I could switch to that that's not what I'm doing here but
[16:51.040 --> 16:56.120]  that's that's a real element of this in fact it's the top element it's the main
[16:56.120 --> 17:01.280]  element it's the center of this system the globalist are into a religion and
[17:01.280 --> 17:05.680]  even if you don't believe in a religion that say pygmies believe in an Africa
[17:05.680 --> 17:11.000]  me a worshipping animals or whatever or you don't believe in Islam or you don't
[17:11.000 --> 17:16.160]  believe in Christianity or whatever the point is there's still people that
[17:16.160 --> 17:19.680]  believe that and if you were an anthropologist you would study that but
[17:19.680 --> 17:25.320]  that like no I don't even look at that but that religion affects things and I'm
[17:25.320 --> 17:30.600]  telling you the elite have a Luciferian religion they are not devil worshipers
[17:30.600 --> 17:40.320]  they believe Lucifer is God now it tends to be Satanists that serve them as
[17:40.320 --> 17:44.120]  their mid-level and then below that compartmentalized people who actually
[17:44.120 --> 17:48.040]  mean well and are under peer pressure control and then that's pretty much the
[17:48.040 --> 17:52.320]  power strategy of the pyramid as you got those that actually believe the false
[17:52.320 --> 17:56.520]  lie the deception that give power to the to the peace system you've got the
[17:56.520 --> 18:05.400]  the Satanist and then mercenaries and control freaks and sadist and wicked
[18:05.400 --> 18:12.600]  people beneath that and then at the top the very small core of the New World
[18:12.600 --> 18:18.960]  Order are heavily deceived but actually believe that they are bringing in this
[18:18.960 --> 18:25.320]  enlightened New Age world government to cleanse the earth of the human scourge
[18:25.320 --> 18:29.400]  to reduce the majority of the world population and to bring in the age of
[18:29.400 --> 18:35.640]  Lucifer or the age of Aquarius and this is their writings this is the first
[18:35.640 --> 18:42.240]  earth battalion official Pentagon teaching since the 1970s and we've
[18:42.240 --> 18:46.640]  covered that and I've talked to members of those top teams I've talked to the
[18:46.640 --> 18:51.360]  head of Fort Bragg the head of special forces the head of all army special ops
[18:51.360 --> 19:01.240]  I've talked to three star generals here on air about this stuff and it's real it's
[19:01.240 --> 19:07.200]  real and whether some scientifically believe that the human brain has a
[19:07.200 --> 19:10.160]  sixth sense it's been proven scientifically but that it's actually
[19:10.160 --> 19:13.880]  broadcasting you read the Bible the Bible says that that we're made in the
[19:13.880 --> 19:22.040]  image of God as creators sub creators we that's why we create we build but the
[19:22.040 --> 19:27.960]  devil is never a maker he's a taker he's a destroyer and so that's the system
[19:27.960 --> 19:34.040]  that this dark global spirit energy force whatever you want to call it someone
[19:34.040 --> 19:37.640]  say it's manifested by bad people and then it's like a group collective of evil
[19:37.640 --> 19:40.840]  fighting the group collective of good that's kind of what the New Ages think
[19:40.840 --> 19:47.800]  and see there to see as well it's much larger than that and it is manifesting
[19:47.800 --> 19:52.600]  this system of destruction and I'll give you an example of that radiation levels
[19:52.600 --> 19:56.200]  across the world are going up up up we're gonna break that down on the other

[35:08.720 --> 35:18.640]  sensational it's sensational like we had a headline a week ago it was like a TSA
[35:18.640 --> 35:23.800]  you know Viper teams more states accepting Viper teams it should be feds
[35:23.800 --> 35:26.200]  taking over more states because by the way they're not even accepting them
[35:26.200 --> 35:30.080]  they're just doing you know martial law and being implemented I mean you know
[35:30.080 --> 35:37.920]  again and I I understand I'm using this as a learning experience I understand
[35:37.920 --> 35:42.240]  that people who live this and fight this all the time we even get acclimated
[35:42.240 --> 35:49.240]  towards just accepting it and not seeing how serious all of this stuff is now I
[35:49.240 --> 35:52.160]  want to get into
[35:56.600 --> 36:00.120]  yeah I want to air this Charlotte Izabee piece we aired it during the 27 hour
[36:00.120 --> 36:03.560]  broadcast but it has not gotten the attention it deserves Charlotte Izabee
[36:03.560 --> 36:06.920]  breaks down the history of the secret order and reveals just how big this elite
[36:06.920 --> 36:12.240]  club at Yale really is and how much political power they have wielded over
[36:12.240 --> 36:17.960]  the past 180 years well they're they're not big they're very small but just how
[36:17.960 --> 36:23.120]  incredibly important they are Izabee unveils the connection of her father and
[36:23.120 --> 36:28.440]  grandfather to skull and bones secret society including an exclusive look at
[36:28.440 --> 36:32.600]  the official members list the public was never meant to see and there's a lot of
[36:32.600 --> 36:38.520]  this is first time ever it should be for the first time ever the woman who
[36:38.520 --> 36:42.440]  originally released the first known information about skull and bones to
[36:42.440 --> 36:48.320]  Anthony Sutton now reveals all she kept the fact that she was the leaker secret
[36:48.320 --> 36:53.680]  for more than two decades now she lays it all on the line Charlotte Izabee the
[36:53.680 --> 36:58.640]  order of skull and bones blown wide open what the cult of death doesn't want you
[36:58.640 --> 37:05.880]  to know and again we're so busy just firing all these pearls out at people of
[37:05.880 --> 37:10.240]  incredible investigative reporting we never even turn around and and really
[37:10.240 --> 37:14.560]  even properly promote it when we're good at getting the info out but we're not
[37:14.560 --> 37:21.360]  good at really saying hey we're delivering the goods here like I'm gonna
[37:21.360 --> 37:24.440]  call Paul Watson and have him watch it do a big report or Steve Watson or
[37:24.440 --> 37:28.880]  Aaron Dykes just to say look at what we bring you look at this information
[37:28.880 --> 37:33.000]  appreciate this this is like some hundred carat diamond just kind of thrown
[37:33.000 --> 37:38.640]  off under the under the under the bushes but by me I didn't take the time out to
[37:38.640 --> 37:44.300]  write the write-up for it I didn't see now you're getting inside my
[37:44.300 --> 37:54.800]  frustration because man I am just completely overwhelmed right now and
[37:54.800 --> 38:00.600]  I'm so I'm so angry about what's happening you know I want to do a
[38:00.600 --> 38:09.720]  report tonight dealing with the fact that the elite has gone crazy look we had a
[38:09.720 --> 38:15.000]  corrupt out-of-control ruling class in 1990 but they had the Army study DU in
[38:15.000 --> 38:24.440]  the 50s 60s 70s 80s Dr. Doug Rocky the head of their DU program physicist said
[38:24.440 --> 38:29.520]  do not use this you know unless you're an absolute emergency as all the scientists
[38:29.520 --> 38:35.600]  before him said and they went ahead and used it now why in 1991 did they go from
[38:35.600 --> 38:38.640]  saying we can't use this because it ignites going down the barrel of the
[38:38.640 --> 38:44.200]  Abrams gun or the 50 cal or whatever system they're using it on and we
[38:44.200 --> 38:49.640]  certainly can't have the troops moving to areas we've bombed with this because
[38:49.640 --> 38:54.480]  it leaves a residue that if you breathe any of it is going to reduce your life
[38:54.480 --> 39:00.680]  massively is going to kill you it was cyanide and killed you on the spot it'd
[39:00.680 --> 39:04.640]  be a big controversy but because it kills you slowly you just crawl off like a
[39:04.640 --> 39:08.760]  rat takes you a few weeks to die you know I see all these reports of the
[39:08.760 --> 39:13.120]  troops bodies parts thrown in landfills just like the 9-11 first responders and
[39:13.120 --> 39:18.320]  troops sawed in half or you know but families being delivered rotten bodies
[39:18.320 --> 39:22.240]  it's all over the news it's a huge controversy I'm getting emails saying
[39:22.240 --> 39:27.080]  how dare you lie about it how dare you you make it up okay I'm making it up
[39:27.080 --> 39:30.800]  then if you don't watch the news know about the big controversies and think
[39:30.800 --> 39:34.040]  I'm making it up that the government would do this fine then just just believe
[39:34.040 --> 39:40.360]  whatever you want here it is update Pentagon reviews punishment over war
[39:40.360 --> 39:47.040]  dead remains that's Reuters back you can aim the document camera over here it's
[39:47.040 --> 39:51.080]  a big controversy I reported it last week and people said I was a liar but I
[39:51.080 --> 39:54.040]  was covering mainstream news but yeah I'm still a liar though even though it's
[39:54.040 --> 39:57.880]  all admitted and the Secretary of Defense is running around talking about it
[39:57.880 --> 40:07.000]  given press conferences it doesn't exist so continuing here they don't care
[40:07.000 --> 40:10.480]  about the troops they don't care about anybody they just fill you with a bunch
[40:10.480 --> 40:16.680]  of propaganda that oh it's Veterans Day let's let's wrap some people in a FLAG
[40:16.680 --> 40:22.160]  everything's wonderful and let's have everybody stay on the plane while they
[40:22.160 --> 40:25.440]  bring the coffin off the Southwest Airlines flight that I flew in on and
[40:25.440 --> 40:28.760]  let's just have the captain make constant comments during the flight about
[40:28.760 --> 40:32.360]  how incredible our troops are and how wondrous and the captain carries the
[40:32.360 --> 40:38.040]  bags off of the of the of the Air Force officer who was who was accompanying
[40:38.040 --> 40:43.160]  the body and and people are crying on board and it's all this big moment
[40:43.160 --> 40:47.600]  meanwhile they're throwing their bodies in landfills meanwhile they're taking
[40:47.600 --> 40:51.560]  their pension funds stealing meanwhile the government could care less and is
[40:51.560 --> 40:55.760]  letting them use weapons that has killed and debilitated hundreds of thousands
[40:55.760 --> 40:59.560]  and they have congressional reports a decade ago about it they've known the
[40:59.560 --> 41:03.920]  whole time most of Doug Rocky's team has died just from being around it to
[41:03.920 --> 41:10.880]  study it in the field he's had 40 something surgeries now last time we
[41:10.880 --> 41:14.120]  tried to get him on he was at the VA and he's trying to get him back on I know
[41:14.120 --> 41:17.480]  he's real sick but let's get try to get Dr. Rocky back on before you know
[41:17.480 --> 41:22.080]  unfortunately it might be too late but see actually caring about them that's
[41:22.080 --> 41:29.280]  Prasada non grata that's no no you don't do that you just put a flag on your car
[41:29.280 --> 41:32.400]  I'm not saying you're bad if you have that but the point is now actually
[41:32.400 --> 41:35.960]  fulfill it you actually defend what the flag symbolizes Bill of Rights
[41:35.960 --> 41:40.240]  Constitution Declaration of Independence private property the family what made the
[41:40.240 --> 41:46.600]  country great see the system the rulers we have are systematically waging war on
[41:46.600 --> 41:50.600]  the Bill of Rights Constitution Declaration of Independence and every
[41:50.600 --> 41:57.600]  form of basic freedom so see they're my enemy but I know the pen is mighter than
[41:57.600 --> 42:02.040]  the sword so I'm fighting them that way but they don't like that because that
[42:02.040 --> 42:05.680]  we're beating them so they're gonna try to make it physical and well defense
[42:05.680 --> 42:10.240]  that's defense you have every right under natural law under God's law to defend
[42:10.240 --> 42:13.560]  yourself and again I'm not somebody looking for violence but I will defend
[42:13.560 --> 42:20.280]  myself I will I will and I don't want this to happen but if it is let it come
[42:20.280 --> 42:29.160]  why sit we hear idle the war is already begun is peace so sweet so dear to be
[42:29.160 --> 42:34.080]  purchased at the price of change and slavery forbid it my countrymen I don't
[42:34.080 --> 42:38.200]  not what course you're gonna take but as for me give me liberty or give me death
[42:38.200 --> 42:43.960]  like colonel Travis down there at the Alamo he said victory or death
[42:44.160 --> 42:52.600]  180 and change against 4,000 and he knew but he couldn't live his life as a
[42:52.600 --> 42:59.240]  coward and that example that sacrifice led to things much greater that's what
[42:59.240 --> 43:07.400]  living is really all about that's adventure that's courage that's bold and
[43:07.400 --> 43:13.280]  that's who I remember on Veterans Day not oh we care so much and oh give money
[43:13.280 --> 43:17.120]  to all these charities for the troops that siphon most of it off and oh thank
[43:17.120 --> 43:21.320]  you troops and connecting the troops to the war and always having troops on TV
[43:21.320 --> 43:25.080]  going I want the wars to continue when most the troops in polls are against it
[43:25.080 --> 43:30.720]  and support Ron Paul you know having select psi-op officers speak for all the
[43:30.720 --> 43:36.400]  rest of the military this is about using these well-meaning heroes efforts
[43:36.400 --> 43:43.560]  because regardless they've done it meaning well to sell evil and people are
[43:43.560 --> 43:48.600]  like shut up Alex they're not throwing them in landfills okay fine you want to
[43:48.600 --> 43:55.520]  just you know I told you that since Chernobyl alone since the atomic testing
[43:55.520 --> 44:00.520]  by the Russians and by the United States and by the French and others in the
[44:00.520 --> 44:08.240]  northern hemisphere of the globe that's us up here north the equator up into the
[44:08.240 --> 44:11.480]  60s you can pull these actuary numbers up we've shown them here on air
[44:11.480 --> 44:17.720]  radiation levels doubled then after Chernobyl because that's a dirty event a
[44:17.720 --> 44:22.600]  reactor melting down is much worse than even an average hydrogen or atomic bomb
[44:22.600 --> 44:32.000]  going off unless it's jacketed and cobalt or balconium G or whatever to make it a
[44:32.000 --> 44:34.440]  dirty bomb
[44:35.440 --> 44:38.600]  I'm not talking about a little dirty bomb where they blow up some hospital
[44:38.600 --> 44:42.360]  x-ray equipment I mean I mean a hydrogen bomb that also radiates things for a
[44:42.360 --> 44:46.960]  billion years now they got those called a doomsday machine by the way those are
[44:46.960 --> 44:53.080]  real the rank operation came up with it that that movie is about the real doctor
[44:53.080 --> 45:02.560]  strange love continuing them oh yeah they've got bombs that you detonate it
[45:02.560 --> 45:07.840]  it kills the entire earth the radiation yeah 100 years underground means
[45:07.840 --> 45:13.200]  nothing our government the Russians they've all made them the Chinese have
[45:13.200 --> 45:16.960]  made them they've got them that go in the atmosphere and detonate and then it's over
[45:16.960 --> 45:21.120]  and and and I guess they're getting us warmed up for that some say the elites
[45:21.120 --> 45:24.840]  have ways to to remove this from their bodies I've done some research I don't
[45:24.840 --> 45:29.320]  think that's probably true I mean they got a lot of hidden technology but not
[45:29.320 --> 45:33.120]  that type look at this one out of associated press nuke agency reports
[45:33.120 --> 45:40.160]  unusual radiation in Europe well they've they've registered unusual radiation
[45:40.160 --> 45:48.360]  here in the United States it's gone up massively massively so it doubled in the
[45:48.360 --> 45:51.960]  atomic testing and then basically doubled again in the northern hemisphere and now
[45:51.960 --> 45:56.040]  the reporting it's way above that last doubling and what was their answer oh this
[45:56.040 --> 46:00.000]  isotopes up a couple thousand this is up a hundred thousand will dozens of
[46:00.000 --> 46:03.400]  different isotopes we've listed off the EPA website here for you you don't believe
[46:03.400 --> 46:08.400]  you just type into a search engine EPA raises level of what they say is safe of
[46:08.400 --> 46:13.320]  EPA raises levels of radiation what they say safe it'll come up for you EPA
[46:13.320 --> 46:17.240]  website because they're magic they just you know it's kind of like they could say
[46:17.240 --> 46:21.840]  well a teaspoon of cyanide will kill you know dozens and dozens of people but
[46:21.840 --> 46:25.320]  we'll just say you can eat cyanide now and wave a wand and then you could drink
[46:25.320 --> 46:30.720]  it and you don't die because they said so they're God they say spying on you
[46:30.720 --> 46:34.760]  without warrants and lamp poles listening and watching you secretly is not big
[46:34.760 --> 46:40.000]  brother so it's not they say the troops after 1990 can use DU and have no
[46:40.000 --> 46:43.600]  decontamination or nothing and just use it in proving grounds and shooting
[46:43.600 --> 46:49.720]  ranges everywhere in cities and areas all over the US it's fine use it all over
[46:49.720 --> 46:54.680]  Hawaii use it all over Puerto Rico use it all over the US it's fine the troops
[46:54.680 --> 46:58.680]  can use it it's fine you can move right into a bunker bombed out by precision
[46:58.680 --> 47:03.320]  guided musicians DU tipped and breathe it of course you're gonna die a lung
[47:03.320 --> 47:06.840]  cancer in 10 15 years if you're lucky a lot of start bleeding out the nose
[47:06.840 --> 47:12.200]  kidney failure had you ship them home because because they said so here magic
[47:12.200 --> 47:18.840]  wand magic wand here it's safe magic wand here magic wand doesn't matter how
[47:18.840 --> 47:22.800]  many nuclear physicists I have on nuclear chemical physicists like Busby
[47:22.800 --> 47:27.480]  and others who he says this is a top advisor to the EU he says now me and
[47:27.480 --> 47:30.600]  many colleagues believe it could be about population reduction because the
[47:30.600 --> 47:34.440]  elite are consciously doing this they've got reactors all over the US leaking
[47:34.440 --> 47:37.960]  now it's a minor footnote after Fukushima in Canada leaking serious
[47:37.960 --> 47:42.160]  radiation Francis had huge nuclear disasters two up in the last three
[47:42.160 --> 47:45.840]  months they got to be releasing this stuff on purpose now there's were there's
[47:45.840 --> 47:49.600]  disasters everywhere now and now it's just like well don't worry we just raise
[47:49.600 --> 47:54.040]  what level safe oh your Geiger counters picking that up it's okay
[47:54.040 --> 48:01.760]  sweetie cake it's all right government loves you very low levels it's very low
[48:01.760 --> 48:07.840]  they say mm-hmm which are higher than normal but doesn't seem doesn't seem
[48:07.840 --> 48:11.640]  because they raise the level they say safe in Europe as well to pose a health
[48:11.640 --> 48:17.800]  hazard are being registered in the Czech Republic that they guess they weren't
[48:17.800 --> 48:21.600]  playing ball and reported it and elsewhere in Europe oh okay the
[48:21.600 --> 48:26.160]  international atomic energy agency said Friday the agency said the cause was not
[48:26.160 --> 48:31.440]  known but was the result of but was not the result of Fukushima's the Achi
[48:31.440 --> 48:34.560]  nuclear disaster which spread radiation across the globe in March yeah
[48:34.560 --> 48:38.680]  because the atomic energy agencies openly run and funded by the big nuclear
[48:38.680 --> 48:42.480]  lobby so they're they're telling you it's not our reactors that blew up over
[48:42.480 --> 48:45.840]  there of course we got caught lying to you about that earlier about the total
[48:45.840 --> 48:53.520]  meltdowns but just it's not that okay oh is it the disasters in France maybe
[48:53.520 --> 49:00.680]  it's all the other disasters the very low levels of iodine 1 3 1 that's fish
[49:00.680 --> 49:05.680]  in and reactors it's it's Fukushima and it's the French disasters as you can
[49:05.680 --> 49:08.720]  just go look up let's release there you know right away but they're like we
[49:08.720 --> 49:12.240]  don't know we're just nuclear experts and we don't know where this this
[49:12.240 --> 49:17.880]  fingerprint came from it you know let's say I'm the iodine 1 3 1 Alex Jones and
[49:17.880 --> 49:21.840]  I put my thumb prints all over everything and they go look and go that's
[49:21.840 --> 49:28.600]  Alex Jones but we don't know who that is I mean it's 100% fish in meltdown they
[49:28.600 --> 49:32.240]  know where it's coming from it's coming from meltdowns that's when 1 3 1 is
[49:32.240 --> 49:35.120]  released and they're just like everything's fine everything's wonderful
[49:35.120 --> 49:38.720]  everything's wonderful because we don't know where it's coming from though maybe
[49:38.720 --> 49:43.800]  an easter bunny past gas or something I'm sorry
[49:45.560 --> 49:50.000]  the very low levels of iodine 1 3 1 have been measured in the atmosphere the
[49:50.000 --> 49:56.440]  agency said the statement it said such radio isotope will lose much mis
[49:56.440 --> 50:00.160]  radiation in about eight days well everything's fine then just reactors
[50:00.160 --> 50:05.160]  belching it bread bread however a official familiar with the matter who
[50:05.160 --> 50:08.120]  asked for anonymity because he was not authorized comment said the release
[50:08.120 --> 50:15.160]  appeared to be continuing well so what see now it's just an attitude well for
[50:15.160 --> 50:19.200]  50 years they've said don't let troops use this DU it's so it's an emergency
[50:19.200 --> 50:23.960]  weapon of the Russians pour across the folder gap into Germany and we're out
[50:23.960 --> 50:28.160]  number 10 to 1 and nuclear war is already happening you get in decon suits and
[50:28.160 --> 50:32.720]  these small arms can take out tanks but you don't serve this out unless you're
[50:32.720 --> 50:36.560]  in a red level total meltdown already a nuclear war is that understood that's
[50:36.560 --> 50:40.800]  what the manual said 1990 they just said you know what disregard all that have
[50:40.800 --> 50:46.360]  fun here it is use it use it use it oh but it gets worse Japanese debris's to
[50:46.360 --> 50:50.240]  start hitting Western US and Canada this week took it six months to get across
[50:50.240 --> 50:55.320]  the thousands of houses everything covered with radiation including plutonium
[50:55.320 --> 50:58.720]  that lasts a billion plus years it's all coming to California and they're not
[50:58.720 --> 51:01.560]  gonna get a Geiger counter out there to warn you they're just gonna let you die
[51:01.560 --> 51:04.960]  we all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most
[51:04.960 --> 51:09.240]  trusted name in water filtration as an authorized Berkey dealer for over six
[51:09.240 --> 51:13.720]  years in serving thousands of satisfied customers the Berkey guy offers amazing
[51:13.720 --> 51:17.680]  specials for Berkey water filtration systems the Berkey light systems include

[54:04.200 --> 54:10.200]  Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your
[54:10.200 --> 54:19.160]  mind last year when it came out that it was melamine it's now two years ago in a
[54:19.160 --> 54:23.220]  lot of baby formula and stuff the in the Chinese executed the heads of the
[54:23.220 --> 54:27.960]  companies that did it our government just said no recall melamine is not bad
[54:27.960 --> 54:33.600]  for children every study every report the kidney damage kidney failure brain
[54:33.600 --> 54:38.120]  damage horrible our government just said it's good do you use good radiations
[54:38.120 --> 54:44.520]  good all of this stuff is good they are openly telling you it's all good and
[54:44.520 --> 54:49.160]  wonderful and my point is is it's reached the point now of just craziness and
[54:49.160 --> 54:53.600]  this is why cultures collapse civilizations pretty much always fall
[54:53.600 --> 55:00.040]  in because they develop a high level of agrarian technology a superclass gets
[55:00.040 --> 55:05.000]  fat dumb and happy and divorced from reality and start acting like Marianne
[55:05.000 --> 55:11.080]  Twanat and the entire society collapses and I just cannot be force-fed all this
[55:11.080 --> 55:15.320]  patriotic worship of the troops when they say stand at a football game or
[55:15.320 --> 55:18.600]  stand at church or wherever and worship the troops and I want to get up and say
[55:18.600 --> 55:22.080]  okay I'm gonna stand up and say they shouldn't be using do you shut up on
[55:22.080 --> 55:26.920]  patriotic it's supposed to be a hollow worthless system of patriotism towards
[55:26.920 --> 55:35.160]  the corrupt bankers not real patriotism and that's what makes me sick about
[55:35.160 --> 55:38.680]  everyone getting off on the coffin and the dead troop and the crying and all
[55:38.680 --> 55:42.080]  this but you tell these people hey you should actually worry about the troops
[55:42.080 --> 55:47.400]  and do you shut up anti-war communist you're like no I really just want to
[55:47.400 --> 55:51.440]  warn people I yeah right why don't you go tell Bill Clinton how much you love
[55:51.440 --> 55:57.240]  him or you're like hey Obama's corrupt shut up racist I heard MPR this morning
[55:57.240 --> 56:00.680]  with guest after guest with horror as my wife was making breakfast for the
[56:00.680 --> 56:04.040]  children and I and we're sitting there she's listening to it in there they're
[56:04.040 --> 56:08.560]  going well the white people like Herman Cain because he speaks with kind of a
[56:08.560 --> 56:13.880]  black dialect and they like to make fun of black people and I was like what and
[56:13.880 --> 56:18.400]  then another guy came on with the same talking point yeah they like Herman Cain
[56:18.400 --> 56:24.400]  because you know he he sometimes messes up his English well yeah if you
[56:24.400 --> 56:27.480]  actually listen to some black folks that have a kind of a real American black
[56:27.480 --> 56:31.040]  dialect from the south or whatever it's actually just sounds like a redneck
[56:31.040 --> 56:34.440]  with just a little bit of a black accent like it is a pleasing sound to
[56:34.440 --> 56:38.400]  somebody who's used to that cadence but it's not because he's black it's because
[56:38.400 --> 56:43.640]  he sounds like a real regular guy people like me because I sound like a regular
[56:43.640 --> 56:48.640]  guy I'm not putting on some act some some polished Harvard thing like Obama does
[56:48.640 --> 56:53.600]  and then he shows up at events and talks like you know to black folks and then
[56:53.600 --> 56:59.360]  puts on some kind of black accent or Hillary in Kentucky get my hair will

[01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:11.080]  tyrants raid local farm to force a fork to farm dinner picnic to stop some
[01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:16.040]  friends for a few years invite other local farmers and ranchers this is what
[01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:19.480]  we've always done in the country and now all the old folks have died off but
[01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:23.840]  that's pretty much what always happened at our ranch bring their own food and to
[01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:27.120]  barbecue it outside and to cook it and to make ice cream right there on the
[01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:32.160]  spot now you do that it's a gathering and they of course raid them with guns
[01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:36.600]  and the rest of it so that's how they operate now farce I said you got to have
[01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:40.200]  a permit for this so they got the permit and then still they came it's the
[01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:43.840]  latest case of extreme government food tyranny and one that is sure to have you
[01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:47.520]  reeling in anger and disgust health department officials not servants
[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:52.320]  recently conducted a raid in quail hollow farm an organic community
[01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:58.360]  supported agriculture co-op basically in southern Nevada they can't have that
[01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:01.760]  can't have folks actually bought you know making their own food during its
[01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:08.360]  special farm to fork picnic dinner put out for guests and the agent who arrived
[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:12.520]  on the scene ordered that all the fresh locally produced and pasture raised
[01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:17.920]  meat that was intended for the meal be destroyed I mean we shoot deer and
[01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:20.920]  butcher them and then barbecue them out there on the spot yes you can't do that
[01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:25.360]  as you're a prisoner just like you can't have a garden at your house and you
[01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:29.280]  can't sell lemonade you're a prisoner of the globalist system you've got to be
[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:33.920]  fully domesticated you can't get self-sufficient for about five years now
[01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:37.640]  quail hollow farm has been growing organic produce and raising healthy
[01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:42.200]  pasture-based animals which it provides the members of part of its CSA
[01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:46.520]  program and it recently held its first annual it's its first annual it goes on
[01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:49.680]  they've had some these meetings before but it's the first official farm to fork
[01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:53.920]  dinner event which offered guests an opportunity to tour the farm meet those
[01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:57.680]  responsible for growing raising the food and of course partake in sharing a
[01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:02.840]  meal composed of the delicious bounty with others when the southern Nevada
[01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:06.960]  health district got word of the event decided to get involved the simple
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:10.520]  gathering of friends and neighbors around a giant family-style picnic table
[01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:16.200]  quickly became a convenient target or the heavy hand of the out-of-control
[01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:22.800]  government agency and Mount and Laura bella so the owners and operators of
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:28.120]  quail hollow farm were unprepared for what would happen next and it goes on to
[01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:32.160]  say that without a cause or without a warrant they came in and ordered it not
[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:36.680]  even a court order just just nothing we're God do it we have firearms and it
[01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:42.480]  goes on that they showed up and did all of this even though she went and jumped
[01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:45.800]  to the hoops and got the permit so that's the kind of news I have here's

[01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:11.240]  there's a war on for your mind
[01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:32.200]  all right ladies and gentlemen he is under the weather but he is still agreed
[01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:36.720]  to join us we really appreciate it David Ike of David Ike.com former head of the
[01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:43.120]  Green Party in England former champion goalie and soccer former top BBC sports
[01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:48.960]  news presenter who kind of had his Saul of Tarsus moment on the road to Damascus
[01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:52.960]  knocked off his horse and basically got this download of info as he describes
[01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:58.200]  it about the world about world government about the bizarre activities of
[01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:03.560]  the elite about global pedophile rings well now so many years later so much of
[01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:08.200]  what David Ike has talked about has come true you know David obviously has the
[01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:11.920]  controversial with some view that it's basically an off-world or
[01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:17.080]  interdimensional thing you know the snake of the Bible is real and that's
[01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:21.920]  basically what we think of as the devil and that they are feeding off dark
[01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:26.840]  energy they do come to kill still and destroy and I'm some would say well how
[01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:30.280]  is that any different from what you know people see what Christians say is
[01:09:30.280 --> 01:09:34.640]  pretty weird my point is from my research and you know I was critical of
[01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:38.920]  David 12 years ago I was asked by David Ike and I said he has a lot of great
[01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:46.840]  information but then you know it could could discredit all this other real
[01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:51.400]  stuff he talks about because he then brings in things like this but years
[01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:55.000]  later I realized just having an open discussion is what's important and we've
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.360]  been lied to so much who knows what's real you know I stick to what I can
[01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:03.480]  totally prove because people can't even believe stuff that's on record and
[01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:07.480]  admitted much less things that David Ike talking to different Aboriginal tribes
[01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:10.960]  around the world have this belief it's not just Christians it's not just the
[01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:15.400]  Jews you go back to the original text or or the Sumerians there's definitely a
[01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:19.000]  lot of weird stuff going on the pyramids why are the elites into
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:25.320]  numerology into the occult but I can say this the elite believe they're
[01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:30.320]  worshiping a spiritual entity the elite are into bloodletting and ritual and
[01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:36.280]  pain the elite believe that they are serving the devil Lucifer whatever you
[01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:41.080]  want to call it so from my research bohemian groves skull and bones that's
[01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:44.520]  a hundred percent I want to get into Iran I want to get into this huge build up
[01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:48.480]  all the things that are coming together with David Ike today but first I wanted
[01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:53.200]  to bring up child ritual abuse because David going back almost 20 years ago
[01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:56.560]  would talk about this and be laughed at he'd write books about it saying all
[01:10:56.560 --> 01:11:00.440]  these big elites are involved you know all the big churches all the big and
[01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:04.960]  then no one was saying that then and then it all came out all came out the
[01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:12.360]  Boy Scouts the Vatican other big church arms Church of England the the the big
[01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:18.840]  children's charities the Texas Youth Commission the Texas Rangers exposed
[01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:25.360]  rape rooms torture gladiatorial fighting all of it covered up the point is you
[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:29.840]  scratch anywhere now and you find this and so why are they into this what's
[01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:33.560]  going on now you have the Penn State thing you have the head coach getting a
[01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:37.400]  criminal lawyer you know we now learn the police knew for 18 years this was
[01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:42.720]  going on now it's being reported that donors were brought in well obviously the
[01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:47.160]  guys in there raping children who are part of the second mile you know a
[01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:51.000]  charity helping the disadvantaged children in quotes their brain he's
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:56.160]  raping them in the field house that you know has people in it 24 hours a day at
[01:11:56.160 --> 01:12:01.160]  a major college 365 days a year in broad daylight that's because they believe
[01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:04.840]  they were protected so the other question is why is this coming out now is it
[01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:08.320]  being used to blackmail others so David Ike is here in the US is going to be
[01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:12.280]  speaking in several places you can may still be able to get tickets usually
[01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:18.600]  sells out find out more at David Ike dot com but first off David you've been on
[01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:25.080]  this all along again now it's coming out everywhere CPS Dinecore Halliburton
[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:28.600]  mainstream news kidnapping children worldwide they don't get into any
[01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:33.000]  trouble congressional hearings about it no one gets in trouble I mean this is
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:40.480]  how what is going on because you called it first David what is going on sorry
[01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:43.600]  about my voice today I've been struggling now since we last spoke and
[01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:47.880]  with my health I'm just coming out of it now so I can now I can talk to you
[01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:51.680]  thank goodness it's about I couldn't before this morning but yes this is a
[01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:56.680]  very important area you see you know when when people talk about the fact
[01:12:56.680 --> 01:13:03.160]  that you go so far and then then you won't go any further or you go too far
[01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:10.200]  and you go far too far and all the rest of it my philosophy from day one 21
[01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:14.880]  years ago when I consciously started investigating this was I wanted to know
[01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:21.520]  what was going on I wasn't I wasn't interested in confirming my elite
[01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:26.040]  system or confirming my preconceived idea I wanted to know what was going on and
[01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:30.640]  to do that you have to suspend a preconceived idea because if you don't
[01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:36.320]  then that will edit and censor your information as you as you are going
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:41.240]  along this line a lot of people with a very fixed religious beliefs will get
[01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:45.360]  to a point and they'll say well the information is pushing me here but if I
[01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:49.160]  go any further then my religious beliefs in all the detail that I've accepted it
[01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:55.280]  is going to be possibly undermined possibly gonna be challenged so I ain't
[01:13:55.280 --> 01:14:00.360]  going there and what you need is a completely open mind not a naive mind
[01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:05.600]  which will say oh I got someone said it so it must be true you filter it you
[01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:11.760]  question it you check it you double check it but you're open you don't check
[01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:16.280]  things by reflex action and when you do that the information speaks to you by
[01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:20.800]  the nature of the repeating stories the repeating accounts the
[01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:27.320]  repeating situations and you know to get deep into this straight away Alex
[01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:31.880]  are you talking about in terms of you know why why this child abuse I've
[01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:36.800]  written about this for a long long time in some detail and it does come from what
[01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:40.220]  we were talking about last time they which is there are these entities
[01:14:40.220 --> 01:14:45.080]  operating outside human side what we call visible light within the
[01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:50.600]  electromagnetic spectrum because like I said last last time the amount of the
[01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:56.480]  frequency range that we can decode into what we we see as the visual world is
[01:14:56.480 --> 01:15:00.920]  tiny if someone rightly said humans are basically blind compare with what there
[01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:07.360]  is to see in this universe and we eat food and it appears to be solid food
[01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:11.800]  but what it is is energy you know this universe the base construct of this
[01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:16.640]  universe is vibrational information it's what they call waveform information
[01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:21.440]  waveform has a as mainstream science will tell it has the ability to hold
[01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:26.040]  fantastic amounts of information and another level of this universe is
[01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:29.680]  electrical it's an electrical level of the universe another level is digital
[01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:34.000]  this is where numerology comes in and all this stuff and then the level that we
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:39.680]  actually experience as the solid world is holographic illusory physical it
[01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:42.480]  seems to be three-dimensional it seems to be physical but it's not it's an
[01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:46.120]  illusion of the way we decode reality now all these different levels of the
[01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:51.560]  universe vibrational electrical digital holographic are all the same
[01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:54.600]  information they're all expressions of the same information they just take
[01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:59.520]  different forms it's like someone in a yellow dress hands information
[01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:04.080]  someone in a red t-shirt someone in a blue coat the information looks different
[01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:08.840]  you know electrical and vibrational digital and holographic but it's the
[01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:16.000]  same information so what we call food solid food is actually energy it's an
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:19.960]  energetic field that's sure sure and that's cyber space I'm going with this
[01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:28.560]  Alex is that these entities feed not from the solid level of food that we perceive
[01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:33.360]  that they feed directly from energy they get their sustenance from energy and
[01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:40.920]  as I found over all these years of full-time research is that these entities
[01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:50.040]  want human energy of children before tuberty takes place because we perceive
[01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:55.840]  tuberty as a hormonal change that's what's happening in what you might call
[01:16:55.840 --> 01:17:00.640]  the holographic arena that the conscious arena that we experience every day but
[01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:05.440]  what it's an expression of is a change in the base energy field at the wave form
[01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:12.600]  level and after that it's not as pure it's not as you know ideal for them and
[01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:16.360]  that's why every culture in in known human history wants to sacrifice
[01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:21.640]  children yes exactly and it's all about the child's energy before tuberty now
[01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:30.360]  these data files that in all these elite positions the vast overwhelming
[01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:34.680]  majority of them are these hybrid bloodlines that I talked about last
[01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:40.280]  time we had a chat recently they are a hybrid bloodline which has a greater
[01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:46.080]  infusion of genetics and these entities would take a reptilian form and as a
[01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:50.800]  result of this genetic compatibility again the holographic
[01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:55.440]  compatibility at that level there is a vibrational compatibility which makes
[01:17:55.440 --> 01:18:02.000]  these hybrid bloodlines much more powerfully possessible by these entities
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:05.600]  than the general run of the popular let me stop you for a moment because we
[01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:08.960]  got a lot of new listeners today we're on all across the country a lot of new
[01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:13.760]  affiliates okay let me just keep it open mind here I read Genesis and it talks
[01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:19.800]  about God destroying the life on the earth because these entities had come in
[01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:25.560]  and destroyed the genetics or the seed and only Noah was perfect in his genetic
[01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:29.440]  generations then I read that in every other culture says similar things then
[01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:33.480]  I look at the elite who are at the Great Pyramid today trying to you know get
[01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:37.280]  its energy they're they're into this stuff they at least believe it then I
[01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:42.560]  think about Christians they say demons are these fallen entities that are here
[01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:47.600]  on the earth but you can't see them and they love pain and destruction and that
[01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:51.560]  they're there trying to screw up our lives you're just saying that's real
[01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:54.600]  basically because because you're saying reptoids but you're saying they're
[01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:59.600]  interdimensional so that's basically what the Christians say yeah this is an
[01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:04.240]  interesting point Alex and a very important one because you know I've
[01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:09.600]  been saying this for so long over the years so many people are arguing with
[01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:15.720]  each other well when you break it down the fundamentals are the same what
[01:19:15.720 --> 01:19:22.440]  Christians call fallen angels the Nephilim the demons are what the
[01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:28.880]  Muslims call the tin and the Jews have their own names for it as well
[01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:33.200]  and it's what I call the reptilians or the non-human entities the
[01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:38.120]  interdimensional entities and and when you look at the story in the Garden of
[01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:42.720]  Eden I mean it's a symbolic story which can be found in other cultures all
[01:19:42.720 --> 01:19:47.240]  around the world just people really think that the snake in the Garden of Eden
[01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:52.040]  was a snake that could talk you know going along the ground this is all
[01:19:52.040 --> 01:19:57.600]  symbolism and this oh I mean I thought enough I was watching a series on the
[01:19:57.600 --> 01:20:03.000]  history channel only this very week which is called ancient aliens the
[01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:08.640]  series and one of them I watched was all about the evidence which I've been
[01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:12.760]  putting out for all these years of the fact that there were non-human entities
[01:20:12.760 --> 01:20:17.360]  talked about in all the ancient cultures but in the bread with humans
[01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:23.200]  creating a hybrid bloodline these these Christians out there these are the
[01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:28.120]  sons of God who interbred with the daughters of men it comes up
[01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:35.360]  everywhere and these entities are therefore possessible because there is
[01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:39.800]  a greater genetic and vibrational frequency compatibility between the
[01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:43.920]  possessing entity and the possessed hybrid bloodline and what happens is
[01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:50.720]  that these these pedophiles that that is in the genetics is in the genetics
[01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:54.880]  they are attracted to sex with children and what these entities want
[01:20:54.880 --> 01:20:59.600]  operating outside of human human side to the conscious conscious mind frequency
[01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:04.520]  range they want children's energy and you know it's sick but then let's get down
[01:21:04.520 --> 01:21:10.640]  to this what is happening when the pedophile is having sex with the child
[01:21:10.640 --> 01:21:17.600]  is that the entity is using the pedophile as a conduit to suck the
[01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:23.840]  energy of the child to itself it's energy vampiring that's what's
[01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:28.080]  happening to these kids and that's why you quite rightly you know talked about
[01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:33.520]  a few minutes ago Alex but this child abuse is everywhere what about my
[01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:42.040]  instinct what about my instinct every bone in my body wants to beat these
[01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:46.280]  people's brains out I mean I have to control myself and I don't know why
[01:21:46.280 --> 01:21:49.600]  others don't have the instinct to want to go after these people whoever whatever
[01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:54.160]  I remember you like 15 16 years ago talking about the royal bloodline out
[01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:58.720]  of Transylvania and all those legends and then and then now it's in the British
[01:21:58.720 --> 01:22:02.680]  news that oh royalty just a few hundred years ago was eating people's brains and
[01:22:02.680 --> 01:22:06.960]  body parts and Prince Charles does trace himself back to their original
[01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:11.520]  royalty to Vlad the impaler Count Dracula and it just gets weirder and
[01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:16.520]  weirder and weirder so even if this stuff isn't completely real spiritually at
[01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:20.040]  least at that level what you're saying is interdimensional they think they are
[01:22:20.040 --> 01:22:24.200]  I mean you get into all the iconography of the British royalty and the things
[01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:28.680]  they're into I know just recently you went and protested bravely now it's come
[01:22:28.680 --> 01:22:34.720]  out in the Canadian news that half the foster children that they take die from
[01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:38.400]  the native tribes and reportedly they're killing them and this is in the
[01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:44.160]  news that half of them are dying I mean my god how big is this it's massive
[01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:51.080]  because they have an insatiable desire for the energy of children and thus they
[01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:57.000]  they need massive numbers of children for instance you know Belgium which is a
[01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:03.440]  small country in Europe is a massive center for pedophilia and satanism
[01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:10.600]  why because it's that it's the base in Brussels for NATO and the base in
[01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:14.960]  Brussels for the European Commission that runs the European Union therefore
[01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:19.240]  these elite people gathering Belgium in very very large numbers the matter of
[01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:23.720]  course of their work and thus there is a massive demand for children in Belgium
[01:23:23.720 --> 01:23:28.240]  as a result it's absolutely it's strong and for those that don't know telling
[01:23:28.240 --> 01:23:32.000]  about the cases where they where the police won't help kids in the cages who
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:36.520]  they kill it's all come out in millions of marched over it well this is the
[01:23:36.520 --> 01:23:42.480]  point if you look at the pyramidal structure of everything where
[01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:47.240]  everything is a pyramid and a pyramid within a pyramid and how they're
[01:23:47.240 --> 01:23:51.960]  compartmentalized so the vast majority of people in a pyramid be it the police
[01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:57.480]  or social services a child protection or or whatever they're compartmentalized to
[01:23:57.480 --> 01:24:01.800]  the point where they only have to know as much as they need to know to do their
[01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:05.280]  individual job they don't know it all fits together and when you look at these
[01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:10.320]  pyramids you don't have to control many positions within the police and within
[01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:17.120]  social services to stop an investigation going ahead into into this stuff or the
[01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:22.640]  target someone and cover it up you only have to cover those positions that
[01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:26.400]  that have the power to decide if the investigation is going to go ahead or
[01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:32.680]  not see what happened this is a classic in Belgium there was an investigator who
[01:24:32.680 --> 01:24:37.160]  got on the case of this guy Mark Dutrow who was found to have killed children
[01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:40.760]  had their kids in cages under the stairs and everything and he got on it
[01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:45.800]  early you know as we know that with many of these things like false flags the
[01:24:45.800 --> 01:24:49.480]  information really is most vulnerable to come out immediately after it's happened
[01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:54.960]  before they've got the lid on well this guy very quickly a genuine man started
[01:24:54.960 --> 01:25:01.040]  to connect and he said this public started to connect Dutrow to very senior
[01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:05.920]  elite people within the Belgian establishment and he started talking
[01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:09.320]  about the fact that arrests were imminent imminent what did they do they
[01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:15.960]  facted they facted and under some serious reason and 300,000 people on the
[01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:20.600]  streets of Brussels protesting but they then put another guy in who completely
[01:25:20.600 --> 01:25:25.120]  put the lid on and the whole thing was was was squashed this is how it is see
[01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:30.080]  I am exposed a guy called Ted Heath who was Prime Minister of Britain between
[01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:35.920]  1970 and 74 who signed us into what is now the European Union as a mega mega
[01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:42.280]  child killer and satanist and child abuser and I put it in a book in 1998 and
[01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:46.840]  he was alive for a long time afterwards a journalist rang him when it came out
[01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:50.440]  read the passage to him I'd only said he's David I must be mad and nothing
[01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:54.400]  else happened I've been naming father George Bush in exactly the same way since
[01:25:54.400 --> 01:26:03.540]  the mid 90s and the thing is the ratio of pedophiles child abusers and
[01:26:03.540 --> 01:26:11.520]  satanist to two positions are much more higher in the upper echelons than in the
[01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:15.760]  general population because these bloodlines these hybrids operate in
[01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:19.040]  the upper with the cesspit really but you know what I mean upper echelons of
[01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:25.320]  society this is why there's so many pedophiles and satanist among politicians
[01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:29.320]  and people that run the banking system etc in my last book Alex human race get
[01:26:29.320 --> 01:26:33.600]  off your knees that's before it went to print I came across this document detailed
[01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:39.600]  document came out of Australia and it claimed to be not a deathbed confession
[01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:45.400]  because he agreed with it but a deathbed expose a of how it's fate is and runs the
[01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:52.080]  world as he put it and he was supposed to be a guy in a major satanic lodging
[01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:57.080]  Sydney who died in 2004 and this stuff eventually came out well I can't say
[01:26:57.080 --> 01:27:01.200]  we genuinely they're not what I can see up to 21 years of investigating this but
[01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:04.840]  whoever wrote it had a stunningly accurate detailed knowledge of
[01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:10.600]  satanism and he talked talked in there about how they bring politicians into
[01:27:10.600 --> 01:27:17.720]  this child abuse to actually entrap them so that they will from that time
[01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:22.480]  onwards never say no to anything they're told to introduce or campaign for or
[01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:26.120]  block let me stop you're right there David last night on the nightly news I
[01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:30.600]  showed the images of George W. Bush kissing Jeff Gannon on the head and
[01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:34.360]  hugging him at press conferences the mail madam I showed the Washington Times
[01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:40.640]  and news clips CBS where they admitted in the late 80s early 90s the callboy
[01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:44.840]  rings in the White House after midnight same thing happened under the last
[01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:50.120]  bush that all came out the hundreds of visits I showed the mainstream news
[01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:55.240]  articles were Nixon admitted at Bohemian Grove it was a giant quote gay orgy where
[01:27:55.240 --> 01:28:00.360]  they fly in the gay porn stars all of this is there and Nixon basically said
[01:28:00.360 --> 01:28:04.600]  you've got to go there to become a made man in politics even though he didn't
[01:28:04.600 --> 01:28:12.560]  like it and now we see you know the the happy Valley the sunny Valley whatever
[01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:17.320]  name but what is it sunny Valley happy Valley a happy Valley there in
[01:28:17.320 --> 01:28:22.480]  Pennsylvania and now we're learning exactly what I said on Monday it's just
[01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:26.400]  like the Texas Youth Commission it's across the board cover up the police
[01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:31.600]  knew they all knew and now probably nobody else is gonna go to jail but the
[01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:34.720]  one individual they've got a burn because they can bring down the whole
[01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:39.760]  system with this information and then you learn that it's again it's these
[01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:46.120]  children's charities that these big charities for children who were above
[01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:53.520]  reproach and the CPS they can get away with bloody murder and Dinecore is the
[01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:56.560]  biggest global contractor Dave I'm gonna come back from break and talk about
[01:28:56.560 --> 01:29:00.840]  this who's been caught Chicago Tribune kidnapping kids worldwide then they're
[01:29:00.840 --> 01:29:06.160]  the biggest private contractor in the US as CPS taking kids I mean this is right
[01:29:06.160 --> 01:29:12.960]  out in the open yes this is a this is a great amalgamation a great tapestry of
[01:29:12.960 --> 01:29:17.360]  a different organizations and different networks and different excuses but all
[01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:21.840]  have the same common theme getting children into their control this is
[01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:27.200]  why as the the insatiable desire for children increases but now they've
[01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:32.600]  been over the last little while in America in Britain in increasing
[01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:36.600]  numbers of countries they have a social services or so-called child protection
[01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:42.080]  taking children from loving parents for the most outrageous curiously stay
[01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:47.080]  there let's talk about it yeah yeah CPS is literal Renfield vampire agents
[01:29:47.080 --> 01:29:55.520]  coming to get your kids we're on the March the empires on the run Alex Jones
[01:29:55.520 --> 01:30:03.920]  and the GCN radio network this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[01:30:03.920 --> 01:30:08.320]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:12.360]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:15.760]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:20.280]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[01:30:20.280 --> 01:30:24.840]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:28.880]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:32.680]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[01:30:32.680 --> 01:30:36.280]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[01:30:36.280 --> 01:30:40.640]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[01:30:40.640 --> 01:30:43.800]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:47.440]  generators offered by solution from science one of my oldest sponsors you
[01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:52.240]  can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's my solar
[01:30:52.240 --> 01:30:56.520]  backup.com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to my solar

[01:33:07.160 --> 01:33:15.400]  resistance you're listening to the Alex Jones show all right David Ike with his
[01:33:15.400 --> 01:33:18.280]  five minutes into the next hour he's very gracious to have joined us David Ike
[01:33:18.280 --> 01:33:25.040]  com gracious because he's ill and he's going to be speaking and several areas

[01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:31.800]  he's like I am he's so busy trying to cover the info he never even gets to
[01:33:31.800 --> 01:33:36.320]  basically what he's doing but but here's just two articles I saw today in my
[01:33:36.320 --> 01:33:42.800]  news stack all over the United States children as young as two are put on
[01:33:42.800 --> 01:33:45.680]  government school buses now because now government's trying to make it
[01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:51.080]  mandatory that at age two to three your children are sent to government school
[01:33:51.080 --> 01:33:57.560]  so they totally have you here it is out of Houston Houston television it says
[01:33:57.560 --> 01:34:05.120]  four-year-old left at wrong bus stop and this is out of channel two in Houston
[01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:10.840]  two miles away her four-year-old son and then she got all panicked and they're
[01:34:10.840 --> 01:34:16.600]  saying that's not endangering the child well it's endangering the child to give
[01:34:16.600 --> 01:34:20.960]  your child to the state at any age these public schools are full of these
[01:34:20.960 --> 01:34:26.320]  predators it's run by predators with a bunch of naive people around them and
[01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:29.840]  then here's another article but again I saw an article a few weeks ago where
[01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:34.120]  what was it a 10-year-old was throwing a fit in the car and so the mom said get
[01:34:34.120 --> 01:34:39.040]  out and walk the last half mile and they took the kid they said that's child
[01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:42.960]  abuse I remember my mother plenty of times if I was being bad you know say
[01:34:42.960 --> 01:34:47.000]  okay we're a mile from home go ahead and get out I remember when I was ten
[01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:50.440]  years old her doing that and that's a way of okay you won't shut up and stop
[01:34:50.440 --> 01:34:56.080]  doing that or whatever you're arguing just you walk home but see oh I'm
[01:34:56.080 --> 01:34:59.400]  sitting up your room without dinner because you you know stole cookies out
[01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:03.040]  of the cookie jar whatever nowadays they'll take your child for that I have a
[01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:06.920]  video it's gonna go up at info wars.com I just sent it to Paul we're in
[01:35:06.920 --> 01:35:10.760]  Kentucky it's a divorce court and the judge didn't even allege the parents
[01:35:10.760 --> 01:35:13.800]  did anything he said you're arguing with each other you haven't agreed on this

[01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:28.240]  these family court judges were set up about a hundred and ten years ago in
[01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:33.000]  England the US as eugenics judges they could say I'm ordering you sterilized
[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:38.240]  it's all done outside law and they've been violating the Constitution for a
[01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:43.520]  long time but here's another article daily mail government doctors gave
[01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:48.720]  1500 children as young as five chemical kosh and I guess that's a mix of
[01:35:48.720 --> 01:35:54.360]  differences chemical kosh with anti psychotic drugs and investigation by
[01:35:54.360 --> 01:35:57.880]  Channel 4 found well they're they're they're drug and newborn babies now so
[01:35:57.880 --> 01:36:02.120]  it's all about abusing children and every wicked tyranny has been and as David
[01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:09.560]  like was saying who can deny now who can deny now that every major institution
[01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:15.560]  out there gets busted raping kids are worse and that every institution big
[01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:20.120]  one is covering it up these people are probably 1% of the population or less
[01:36:20.120 --> 01:36:22.920]  actually went look up some of the statistics last night the estimates
[01:36:22.920 --> 01:36:28.840]  less 1% why are they running everything because that's where they can get away
[01:36:28.840 --> 01:36:33.560]  with it they can only get away with it in the power positions and every culture
[01:36:33.560 --> 01:36:38.840]  ends up being run by a priest class that demands that they be able to chop your
[01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:46.160]  children up every culture this is the curse of humanity and it's not a normal
[01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:50.840]  human activity David Ike you have the floor my friend continue with where this
[01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:54.400]  is going and why you think they're bringing this out now I asked you during
[01:36:54.400 --> 01:36:58.320]  the break and we concur and then let's get into Iran and the huge acceleration
[01:36:58.320 --> 01:37:02.520]  that's happening right now what's happening with a euro all of it David
[01:37:02.520 --> 01:37:10.080]  Ike well you see this is coming out there now in some ways I guess as you've
[01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:15.520]  indicated yourself as maybe a warning to others you know this is what happens
[01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:20.640]  when you you know if you don't do what we say or whatever and it can also be
[01:37:20.640 --> 01:37:26.720]  coming out because it is so prevalent it is so massive I mean you know I I've
[01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:31.320]  been calling the the Church of Rome the Roman Catholic Churches it is now the
[01:37:31.320 --> 01:37:35.840]  Church of Babylon relocated for decades and it is and it's provable fact it
[01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:40.680]  was relocated to Rome and they changed the name and then changed a few names in
[01:37:40.680 --> 01:37:44.480]  the story was basically the same and they were doing this sacrificing children
[01:37:44.480 --> 01:37:48.880]  and abusing children in Babylon and Mesopotamia and all that stuff all those
[01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:54.840]  thousands of years ago and thus the Church of Babylon relocated is probably
[01:37:54.840 --> 01:37:59.400]  I mean wherever I go I was in Australia just very recently in the stories of
[01:37:59.400 --> 01:38:05.480]  running in Australia about children being raped and abused by Roman Catholic
[01:38:05.480 --> 01:38:11.320]  clergy and priests in Australia it's everywhere and when you are the Church
[01:38:11.320 --> 01:38:15.480]  of Babylon relocated and you are operating along the same lines and the
[01:38:15.480 --> 01:38:20.400]  same techniques and the same methods that you have for thousands of years and
[01:38:20.400 --> 01:38:25.560]  of course you're going to be a haven for the abuse of children and in that
[01:38:25.560 --> 01:38:30.480]  document that I mentioned by this Satanist in Australia a deathbed kind
[01:38:30.480 --> 01:38:36.520]  of document that he wrote he said about the way that politicians were pulled
[01:38:36.520 --> 01:38:40.920]  into this but this is a direct quote politicians are introduced by a
[01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:45.960]  carefully graded set of criteria and situations but enable them to accept
[01:38:45.960 --> 01:38:51.600]  that their victims will be quote our little secret young children sexually
[01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:56.320]  molested and physically abused by politicians worldwide are quickly used
[01:38:56.320 --> 01:39:01.520]  as sacrifices in Australia the bodies are hardly ever discovered for Australia
[01:39:01.520 --> 01:39:05.600]  is still a wilderness and what I found over the years and this intensive
[01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:10.400]  research is that in the populated countries in Europe and North America
[01:39:10.400 --> 01:39:16.240]  etc although it's obviously this is a lot of water that's still of a time in
[01:39:16.240 --> 01:39:22.200]  America but they control the crematorium system that they control the
[01:39:22.200 --> 01:39:29.240]  medical system which does the people that do the postmortems etc they cover
[01:39:29.240 --> 01:39:37.040]  every single base and you know there was that guy who was the son of Sam
[01:39:37.040 --> 01:39:43.520]  killer in New York called David Birkowitz and he was the serial killer yes
[01:39:43.520 --> 01:39:50.320]  and he admitted it he went to jail for it but then he started a correspondence
[01:39:50.320 --> 01:39:55.000]  with a Christian minister in which he's explained that yes David Birkowitz he
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:40:00.000]  did it he did kill those people but he was doing it as a front for a satanic
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:06.520]  coven in New York and he said this very telling quote Satanists are peculiar
[01:40:06.520 --> 01:40:11.640]  people they aren't ignorant peasants and semi-literate natives rather their ranks
[01:40:11.640 --> 01:40:15.600]  are filled with doctors lawyers businessmen and basically highly
[01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:19.320]  responsible citizens they are not a careless group who are apt to make
[01:40:19.320 --> 01:40:23.560]  mistakes but they are secretive and bonded together by a common need and
[01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:28.480]  desire to meet our havoc in society it was Alice the Crowley of course a very
[01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:33.720]  famous satanist who said I want blasphemy murder rape revolution anything bad
[01:40:33.720 --> 01:40:39.560]  what these people have the ability to do is live their lives with a stunning
[01:40:39.560 --> 01:40:44.720]  schizophrenia there was a lady some years ago now who was interviewed on the
[01:40:44.720 --> 01:40:50.280]  opera Winfrey show who talked about the fact that she was brought up in a
[01:40:50.280 --> 01:40:55.480]  satanic family in Chicago because we're a barber and Emmanuel all these people
[01:40:55.480 --> 01:41:02.720]  take from and during the day they were pillars of the establishment they
[01:41:02.720 --> 01:41:07.480]  were pillars of society and then at night everything changed she said but at
[01:41:07.480 --> 01:41:12.320]  night what was bad during the day was good what was good during the day was
[01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:18.000]  bad she talks about being forced to witness children being sacrificed
[01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:22.960]  animals being sacrificed and all the abuse well they had rude mothers happening
[01:41:22.960 --> 01:41:26.520]  it's real well sure they had rude mothers but let me just go back and back up
[01:41:26.520 --> 01:41:32.960]  what you just said nationwide hospitals have been caught killing people for
[01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:37.200]  their organs my dad told me about this before it was ever on the news he's a
[01:41:37.200 --> 01:41:41.240]  dentist he knows physicians he said don't sign your organ donor card when you
[01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:44.720]  go and get your driver's license and I'm like yeah right I go why and he goes
[01:41:44.720 --> 01:41:47.880]  well they don't a lot of places will actually let you die if you come in for
[01:41:47.880 --> 01:41:51.720]  something minor they'll kill you he goes that's what I've been told by my
[01:41:51.720 --> 01:41:55.640]  people I said yes specifics he goes no the doctors don't sign their organ donor
[01:41:55.640 --> 01:42:00.960]  card then it came out on 60 minutes and then the biggest place was Chicago but
[01:42:00.960 --> 01:42:06.120]  it turned out Austin's been caught doing it and taking people's retinas and
[01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:10.960]  killing people that could have been saved and taking blood for 40 years
[01:42:10.960 --> 01:42:16.880]  worldwide of all babies it's now 40 years next month 40 years a global UN
[01:42:16.880 --> 01:42:20.560]  program they tell you it's a blood test for your baby now they admit it goes into
[01:42:20.560 --> 01:42:25.400]  this global database it shows how it's this I mean Rick Perry comes out and
[01:42:25.400 --> 01:42:29.160]  says it's the law you must take Gardasil and the whole media goes along with the
[01:42:29.160 --> 01:42:34.760]  lies saying it's the law it's the law I mean their lies are getting bigger and
[01:42:34.760 --> 01:42:38.560]  bigger and bigger and more and more I think they're just exposing all the
[01:42:38.560 --> 01:42:41.560]  pedophilia to where we just hear it every day and get accustomed to it
[01:42:41.560 --> 01:42:45.640]  they're really just just flopping around in front of us well that that whole
[01:42:45.640 --> 01:42:50.120]  thing about getting used to it is very very relevant that that is right there
[01:42:50.120 --> 01:42:56.440]  are people now in these organizations that connect in with children and then
[01:42:56.440 --> 01:43:01.200]  young people who are talking about the sexual rights of children and another
[01:43:01.200 --> 01:43:06.600]  thing you know all that this this pack down stuff in airports it's getting
[01:43:06.600 --> 01:43:10.960]  people used to and children getting used to the fact that this is normal for
[01:43:10.960 --> 01:43:15.040]  this to be done it's all part of the preparation to to push this on where
[01:43:15.040 --> 01:43:21.040]  they really wanted to go but the organs thing is another very relevant story
[01:43:21.040 --> 01:43:26.560]  because you know we had an infamous scandal at a Liverpool hospital called
[01:43:26.560 --> 01:43:32.400]  Older Hay some years ago now where they found that thousands of babies organs
[01:43:32.400 --> 01:43:37.320]  babies who died at the hospital are being kept and not you know and being
[01:43:37.320 --> 01:43:42.680]  retained and you look at the the blood banks you know the blood transfusion
[01:43:42.680 --> 01:43:46.640]  banks there's another way that these people get blood that I mean it will go
[01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:49.880]  to it now but I mean I go into my books as a reason why these people drink blood
[01:43:49.880 --> 01:43:55.440]  and actually need to but it's it's it's massive and what we now beginning to see
[01:43:55.440 --> 01:44:01.080]  is the scale of it because all that's been hidden now is starting to come out
[01:44:01.080 --> 01:44:06.720]  there I mean I said 21 years ago there is an energetic change coming which is
[01:44:06.720 --> 01:44:14.120]  is like a hand going into the cesspit and pulling it to the surface and saying
[01:44:14.120 --> 01:44:18.120]  this is what's been going on I was talking about this 21 years ago and it's
[01:44:18.120 --> 01:44:21.560]  happening not only is it affecting people in the sense that they're
[01:44:21.560 --> 01:44:28.920]  awakening to aspects and kind of views of themselves oh the awakening is
[01:44:28.920 --> 01:44:33.200]  exploding no one can deny it now the point is Alex the point is Alex but the
[01:44:33.200 --> 01:44:37.760]  other thing about a part of the awakening is it's pulling to the surface all
[01:44:37.760 --> 01:44:43.080]  this stuff that they've hidden all this time that there is a very positive thing
[01:44:43.080 --> 01:44:46.760]  going on here look at the things that we know now but we didn't know a year ago
[01:44:46.760 --> 01:44:50.720]  we didn't know five years ago take 20 years ago up we knew virtually nothing
[01:44:50.720 --> 01:44:56.280]  and it's happening and it in some ways yes they let things out for a certain
[01:44:56.280 --> 01:45:01.280]  reason to themselves here and there yes that does happen but it's also this there
[01:45:01.280 --> 01:45:07.080]  are so many leaks in the dyke but the little boy in short trousers is is is
[01:45:07.080 --> 01:45:11.000]  running out of fingers and therefore it's starting to come out we started
[01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:17.760]  to get an understanding of the truly grotesque world that has been going on
[01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:23.080]  all around us while we were watching the game shows of the sport I agree with
[01:45:23.080 --> 01:45:26.040]  you but there's the universal law for every action there's an equal and
[01:45:26.040 --> 01:45:30.400]  opposite reaction the evil has now swollen to where the roaches aren't
[01:45:30.400 --> 01:45:33.840]  hiding behind the walls and coming out at night they're running over you when
[01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:36.600]  you're sitting there on the couch they're now telling you that they're the
[01:45:36.600 --> 01:45:42.040]  boss and so that's finally getting people to wake up what do you make of all
[01:45:42.040 --> 01:45:47.760]  over Europe all over France all over the United States Canada everywhere
[01:45:47.760 --> 01:45:52.720]  they're having radiation releases AP is reporting new agency reports unusual
[01:45:52.720 --> 01:46:00.400]  radiation in Europe it's isotopes associated with fission or meltdown and
[01:46:00.400 --> 01:46:03.840]  they're now saying DU is good for the troops they're using in everywhere there
[01:46:03.840 --> 01:46:08.200]  is an attempt and I've had dr. Busby who's a chemical physicist on and he
[01:46:08.200 --> 01:46:11.360]  says a lot of his colleagues believe it's an attempt to reduce fertility because
[01:46:11.360 --> 01:46:15.320]  nothing works better than radiation but the point is there is this can't just be
[01:46:15.320 --> 01:46:20.400]  accidents suddenly the radiation is being released everywhere what's going on
[01:46:20.400 --> 01:46:23.840]  with that there seems to be an agenda to radiate the planet well that's it
[01:46:23.840 --> 01:46:28.240]  that's an interesting point because I've gone into this in some detail in my
[01:46:28.240 --> 01:46:32.320]  new book remember you are coming out in January and I'm talking about this in
[01:46:32.320 --> 01:46:37.080]  Cleveland, Hawaii or tomorrow Saturday and then in New York next
[01:46:37.080 --> 01:46:41.760]  Sunday this comes into my my 10-hour presentation because I've been ticking
[01:46:41.760 --> 01:46:48.240]  off for years and years and years the continual increase in the radiation that
[01:46:48.240 --> 01:46:54.440]  humans are being subjected to even radiation of food is being pushed up
[01:46:54.440 --> 01:46:58.160]  so-called safe limit but it wasn't safe to start with and you know this is why
[01:46:58.160 --> 01:47:02.400]  I'll go into this in some detail in the new book particularly when Fukushima
[01:47:02.400 --> 01:47:09.520]  happened I looked at it and I thought this release of radiation is so such a
[01:47:09.520 --> 01:47:15.080]  gift to this agenda that I can't believe it's an accident and I explain why it
[01:47:15.080 --> 01:47:19.320]  wasn't an accident actually it was it was it was done deliberately and that's
[01:47:19.320 --> 01:47:23.840]  why virtually nothing's been done about it is pouring out now that's why they
[01:47:23.840 --> 01:47:28.680]  want to change I mean this is this is going far out for many people but hey
[01:47:28.680 --> 01:47:33.800]  let's go there let's see what you think I've been coming to the conclusion for
[01:47:33.800 --> 01:47:38.560]  quite a time now that there is an attempt to change the atmosphere of the
[01:47:38.560 --> 01:47:43.480]  planet now that there is a vibrational no wait a minute though the White House
[01:47:43.480 --> 01:47:47.800]  science are admits they've had a giant chemtrailing operation the varium salts
[01:47:47.800 --> 01:47:52.120]  aluminum dioxide other things and that the quote testing's been secret and that
[01:47:52.120 --> 01:47:56.040]  all the old-timers who tested it and said what it was were 100% right they
[01:47:56.040 --> 01:48:00.440]  they call it geoengineering the globe they admit it's secret they've got
[01:48:00.440 --> 01:48:05.440]  antenna farms they now admit they're spraying things they're playing God yeah
[01:48:05.440 --> 01:48:08.640]  well this you know all that you mentioned comes together in what I'm
[01:48:08.640 --> 01:48:14.320]  saying they want to change the atmosphere of the planet because these
[01:48:14.320 --> 01:48:19.560]  entities have a problem vibrational because they're on a slightly different
[01:48:19.560 --> 01:48:23.480]  frequency or some of them actually in in in our in our frequency and live
[01:48:23.480 --> 01:48:27.320]  within the earth in these interact with the elite in these underground bases
[01:48:27.320 --> 01:48:31.880]  but another problem they have which they want to eradicate is the atmosphere of
[01:48:31.880 --> 01:48:35.920]  our planet is not right for them so they're changing it and what they're
[01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:39.320]  doing also is that they is I mean you've been talking about this for a long time
[01:48:39.320 --> 01:48:44.640]  they want a dramatic reduction in the global population and they want what a
[01:48:44.640 --> 01:48:50.800]  half a billion a billion people maybe to serve them and they know that there
[01:48:50.800 --> 01:48:59.080]  will be a certain amount of humanity that will genetically mutate to be okay
[01:48:59.080 --> 01:49:04.360]  with a more irradiated atmosphere and thus they're the ones they'll want to
[01:49:04.360 --> 01:49:08.920]  keep as the slides and those that that are taken out as a result well they
[01:49:08.920 --> 01:49:12.000]  want to take it out and David David that's actually what all the scientific
[01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:17.360]  magazines they say nothing we do is unnatural any crossing of species if we
[01:49:17.360 --> 01:49:21.000]  release more radiation those that evolve will just live when we merge you with
[01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:25.840]  machines too bad they're already selling that attitude and now everywhere saying
[01:49:25.840 --> 01:49:30.600]  we the elite are a separate species I see it on magazines everywhere they're
[01:49:30.600 --> 01:49:36.280]  saying humanity is splitting into two yes yes and they they want to develop a
[01:49:36.280 --> 01:49:40.920]  mutated humanity that will take the atmosphere that they want to bring it
[01:49:40.920 --> 01:49:43.760]  the change they want to bring it they're bringing it my goodness you know
[01:49:43.760 --> 01:49:49.880]  hearts not just bouncing radio waves off the ionosphere it's punching holes in
[01:49:49.880 --> 01:49:52.920]  it therefore letting cosmic radiation in there shouldn't get it's worse than
[01:49:52.920 --> 01:49:56.400]  that did you know carbon dioxide is the lowest that it's ever been recorded and
[01:49:56.400 --> 01:49:59.800]  and that it's been hundreds of times higher before just the last few hundred
[01:49:59.800 --> 01:50:03.720]  thousand years 14 times higher and they're waging war against it and they're
[01:50:03.720 --> 01:50:07.640]  reporting plants aren't getting the carbon dioxide they need and its levels
[01:50:07.640 --> 01:50:13.600]  are dropping dropping dropping what from zero zero point three nine zero to zero
[01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:20.440]  point zero three six zero again it's like a science fiction movie you couldn't
[01:50:20.440 --> 01:50:30.880]  let me let me let me let me bring up that science fiction movie scenario to you because the first arrival
[01:50:30.880 --> 01:50:37.360]  movie starring Charlie Sheen had the theme of reptilian type entities who
[01:50:37.360 --> 01:50:42.000]  would take it over NASA who would take it over the positions of power and would
[01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:47.680]  changing the atmosphere so they that they could live here because the
[01:50:47.680 --> 01:50:52.600]  atmosphere didn't suit them as it was and that theme is exactly what is happening
[01:50:52.600 --> 01:50:58.680]  and I had a tell us stay there David this is we got to get into Iran we're

[01:51:02.200 --> 01:51:05.920]  know nuclear radiation is still spewing out of the melted down reactors in

[01:54:09.200 --> 01:54:14.160]  Chapman on the incredible economic developments now again David is
[01:54:14.160 --> 01:54:18.080]  predicted with precision the euro the collapse of that the brain of a super
[01:54:18.080 --> 01:54:23.240]  union 20 years ago I mean so much of his regular analysis is so spot-on that's
[01:54:23.240 --> 01:54:27.200]  the dichotomy with people because then he gets into all this other stuff but
[01:54:27.200 --> 01:54:32.000]  when you look at it they got a secret terraforming program geoengineering the
[01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:37.520]  the elites are always into weird bizarre stuff Tony Blair flops around in the
[01:54:37.520 --> 01:54:42.280]  morning and is possessed by the spirit of the light that's like BBC news they've
[01:54:42.280 --> 01:54:46.960]  got weird power pyramids built all over the world I mean the elites are really
[01:54:46.960 --> 01:54:51.800]  into this stuff they believe I mean how many rock and roll stars say they believe
[01:54:51.800 --> 01:54:55.200]  they're possessed by something whatever's going on the elites do believe
[01:54:55.200 --> 01:54:59.920]  they're doing this whether it's real or not now David you had some other points
[01:54:59.920 --> 01:55:03.600]  you wanted to make we were just talking about the TSA we'll get into Iran then
[01:55:03.600 --> 01:55:07.000]  we'll get into all the other issues and the economy and the euro and what's and
[01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:11.560]  where you see that going but you were bringing up the TSA and when the and I
[01:55:11.560 --> 01:55:13.880]  was seeing the point that they're training kids to be groped that's been
[01:55:13.880 --> 01:55:19.080]  admitted and child psychologists say this is terrible a b and being groped by
[01:55:19.080 --> 01:55:23.400]  strangers be that they're getting killed themselves but see they are almost
[01:55:23.400 --> 01:55:28.040]  psychically vampirically getting off on the groping I've witnessed it they like
[01:55:28.040 --> 01:55:33.720]  forcing it on you well you see I'm just wondering very quick point just to
[01:55:33.720 --> 01:55:38.840]  finish off the the atmosphere thing obviously a Fukushima is a wonderful
[01:55:38.840 --> 01:55:43.360]  example of how you can change the atmosphere by you know exploding one of
[01:55:43.360 --> 01:55:48.480]  these things and I came across a lady an Oxford dog called Dr. Kitty
[01:55:48.480 --> 01:55:53.640]  Vittle back in the 90s who worked extensively in the British nuclear
[01:55:53.640 --> 01:55:57.240]  industry at a high level and she told me back in the 90s that the house and
[01:55:57.240 --> 01:56:00.800]  Rothschild the Rothschilds were the ones that brought in nuclear power and
[01:56:00.800 --> 01:56:05.120]  and then showed that it became used to the extent that it is and so they've
[01:56:05.120 --> 01:56:10.320]  created these nuclear bombs in effect all over the all over the world you know
[01:56:10.320 --> 01:56:13.600]  ready to go off whenever they whenever they choose so it is all
[01:56:13.600 --> 01:56:17.560]  systematic this is radiation things but again talking about radiation and
[01:56:17.560 --> 01:56:23.400]  another form of irradiating those are people that now fly without taking the
[01:56:23.400 --> 01:56:28.080]  pad down and what one of the the iron is is I've said many times you know these
[01:56:28.080 --> 01:56:31.200]  people in uniform they think they have power but they don't in fact they're
[01:56:31.200 --> 01:56:37.480]  pawns in a game I mean that the TSA people are just the the civilian well
[01:56:37.480 --> 01:56:41.040]  almost civilian it's more military but the almost the civilian version of
[01:56:41.040 --> 01:56:45.920]  this and to talking about troops being dumb stupid animals be used in US foreign
[01:56:45.920 --> 01:56:49.560]  policy because while they think they have power and they're enforcing the
[01:56:49.560 --> 01:56:53.760]  themselves above people and they're going down like nine pins saying I've
[01:56:53.760 --> 01:56:58.360]  gone into this in the new book with with cancers, leukemias and strokes, Boston
[01:56:58.360 --> 01:57:03.160]  Logan for instance the one of the 9-11 airports is a real cluster for it and
[01:57:03.160 --> 01:57:07.080]  they're going down because I've said to people as I go through these TSA things
[01:57:07.080 --> 01:57:10.520]  I said you know you thought you were radiating the people but you do know
[01:57:10.520 --> 01:57:13.480]  that you're being irradiated cumulatively every day when you have come on
[01:57:13.480 --> 01:57:17.320]  every shift and accumulatively as this effect on them and so they're getting
[01:57:17.320 --> 01:57:24.040]  they're getting killed and the other thing is that I noticed some time ago
[01:57:24.040 --> 01:57:28.840]  Alex that in Britain and around the world but Britain because I've lived
[01:57:28.840 --> 01:57:33.880]  there and I've seen the change but a very very different type of person in
[01:57:33.880 --> 01:57:40.920]  uniform and person in dark suit administration was you know being
[01:57:40.920 --> 01:57:45.320]  employed and the nature of the police the personality of the police of
[01:57:45.320 --> 01:57:51.320]  airport security of government administration was was changing and I
[01:57:51.320 --> 01:57:55.760]  wondered you know I know that's done it but how was they done it and what I
[01:57:55.760 --> 01:58:00.360]  realized is that they had they do something called something called
[01:58:00.360 --> 01:58:06.160]  psychometric testing which is a way of asking questions like in job interviews
[01:58:06.160 --> 01:58:14.440]  to glean no it's on record they hired dumb power-seeking thugs and control
[01:58:14.440 --> 01:58:19.560]  freaks and moron Dudley do rights yeah and the two characteristics they're
[01:58:19.560 --> 01:58:23.600]  after and anybody who's been interacting with law enforcement and
[01:58:23.600 --> 01:58:27.600]  government administration the TSA and stuff will understand this one is as a
[01:58:27.600 --> 01:58:31.520]  narcissistic personality which is described as a psychological condition
[01:58:31.520 --> 01:58:35.560]  characterized by self preoccupation lack of empathy lack of empathy the

[01:59:11.560 --> 01:59:16.960]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[01:59:16.960 --> 01:59:21.880]  the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel

[02:00:59.600 --> 02:01:04.160]  about these personality types that they have systematically targeted for the
[02:01:04.160 --> 02:01:09.600]  uniform and doxy professions not just a psychological condition characterized by
[02:01:09.600 --> 02:01:13.640]  self preoccupation lack of empathy and unconscious deficits and self-esteem
[02:01:13.640 --> 02:01:17.840]  and it's the unconscious deficits and self-esteem that cause these people to
[02:01:17.840 --> 02:01:22.440]  act absolutely over the top when you challenge them it's like how dare you
[02:01:22.440 --> 02:01:27.120]  challenge me you know people getting tainted for just asking for the law
[02:01:27.120 --> 02:01:30.960]  that they're being arrested under and the other one is the psychopath which is
[02:01:30.960 --> 02:01:35.680]  very close a person with an antisocial personality disorder manifested in
[02:01:35.680 --> 02:01:40.200]  aggressive perverted criminal or immoral behavior without empathy here we go
[02:01:40.200 --> 02:01:44.680]  again or remorse and of course all over America and increasingly around the
[02:01:44.680 --> 02:01:49.160]  world you're seeing exactly that type of personality in the uniform
[02:01:49.160 --> 02:01:54.120]  professions policing you know protests and peaceful protests and what have you
[02:01:54.120 --> 02:01:59.280]  done and with their brutality and it's been systematically done see they don't
[02:01:59.280 --> 02:02:03.840]  when you want to control the population you don't want to employ people to
[02:02:03.840 --> 02:02:09.120]  enforce your will whoever conscience that's your worst nightmare you want
[02:02:09.120 --> 02:02:14.520]  people who again you've described it mate who get a kick from enforcing
[02:02:14.520 --> 02:02:18.400]  these things upon other people that's why they're targeting these personalities
[02:02:18.400 --> 02:02:23.400]  and there's business transformation of the personality in the police around
[02:02:23.400 --> 02:02:27.920]  the world from the old school and any of those that remain then they daily light
[02:02:27.920 --> 02:02:31.440]  must be a nightmare when they live among this stuff now to the to this
[02:02:31.440 --> 02:02:38.320]  psychopathic narcissistic brutal control freak that we see increasingly in
[02:02:38.320 --> 02:02:42.040]  uniform well I tell you I should do a news report on this because over the
[02:02:42.040 --> 02:02:45.400]  years I've seen the articles I've read it I every time I mentioned people don't
[02:02:45.400 --> 02:02:48.920]  believe me but you can find mainstream news we're going back about 20 years
[02:02:48.920 --> 02:02:53.800]  under federal grants they will not hire officers with over a hundred IQ that's
[02:02:53.800 --> 02:02:57.560]  where it starts then they have the specialized psychological tests that
[02:02:57.560 --> 02:03:02.040]  are between 500 and 1200 questions and they can actually and they say oh we're
[02:03:02.040 --> 02:03:06.320]  identifying if you're a liar or whatever no they are identifying before they
[02:03:06.320 --> 02:03:11.840]  wanted tough guys that would follow orders and wanted to protect people you
[02:03:11.840 --> 02:03:15.560]  know in the old days it was you weren't in too many fistfights in high school or
[02:03:15.560 --> 02:03:18.360]  whatever you know your family that you know you don't come from tough guys we
[02:03:18.360 --> 02:03:25.160]  don't want you or you know but but now it's they literally want people that
[02:03:25.160 --> 02:03:29.420]  relish dominating and that's why I've been in New York in places and seen
[02:03:29.420 --> 02:03:32.800]  women walk up and go officer what do you know where this is do I look like a
[02:03:32.800 --> 02:03:38.120]  phone book I'll arrest you right now I mean it is it is just outrageous they
[02:03:38.120 --> 02:03:45.120]  want you to know you are trash we are God yeah the guy walking down from his
[02:03:45.120 --> 02:03:49.960]  shifted to Los Angeles Airport was banging his chest like Godzilla shouting
[02:03:49.960 --> 02:03:53.560]  I have the power this is the mentality that we're dealing with and it's been
[02:03:53.560 --> 02:03:57.960]  systematically done and therefore the indeed the relationship the dynamic
[02:03:57.960 --> 02:04:01.960]  between law enforcement and police and government of police is now dramatically
[02:04:01.960 --> 02:04:05.960]  changed and they want to push us down this road even to more extreme levels
[02:04:05.960 --> 02:04:10.960]  because they want their new world order and forced by thuggery and we're
[02:04:10.960 --> 02:04:14.880]  seeing it now and it's not in the future sometimes never over the rainbow we're
[02:04:14.880 --> 02:04:19.040]  living in well Hitler with his brown shirts hired all the criminals as Stalin
[02:04:19.040 --> 02:04:23.680]  unleash them all out of the prisons and made them commanders exactly the same
[02:04:23.680 --> 02:04:28.040]  principle you know what you see is a blueprint I see blueprints everywhere
[02:04:28.040 --> 02:04:32.240]  and of course if you get something that works well why change it so therefore it
[02:04:32.240 --> 02:04:36.000]  becomes a blueprint therefore you can see it through the generations and in
[02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:39.640]  different historical situations it's absolutely the same sex absolutely the
[02:04:39.640 --> 02:04:44.800]  same as what happened in Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russia and the Soviet
[02:04:44.800 --> 02:04:49.120]  Union that followed that's exactly the blueprint the Chinese blueprint is it
[02:04:49.120 --> 02:04:53.120]  happens there in a very incredible if I was a film director and I was doing

[02:08:10.560 --> 02:08:17.360]  all right we're doing a few more minutes with David Ike author researcher
[02:08:17.360 --> 02:08:23.160]  former head of the UK Green Party got into some pretty wild issues but the
[02:08:23.160 --> 02:08:28.680]  globalists are doing crazy things so who knows but we were talking about how on
[02:08:28.680 --> 02:08:36.320]  record now they psychologically profile police to be narcissistic people that
[02:08:36.320 --> 02:08:41.360]  want to dominate and then they also then profile for psychopaths to put them
[02:08:41.360 --> 02:08:45.440]  what they call them high-functioning psychopaths in the command positions now
[02:08:45.440 --> 02:08:50.960]  they haven't completed this conversion yet but they're starting to get close and
[02:08:50.960 --> 02:08:55.800]  Hitler of course hired a bunch of thugs the brown shirts we talked about what
[02:08:55.800 --> 02:08:59.280]  happened with Stalin opening up the prisons and putting aggravated felons
[02:08:59.280 --> 02:09:04.840]  and rapists and murderers in command positions this is what tyrants do it and
[02:09:04.840 --> 02:09:08.000]  you were mentioning that it's a blueprint and it is they hired the former
[02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:11.160]  head of the Stasi Marcus Wolfe to set up Homeland Security that's on record you
[02:09:11.160 --> 02:09:15.920]  can't make this stuff up but if I was doing central casting David for a
[02:09:15.920 --> 02:09:21.160]  dystopic future America under a police state I would I would in casting I would
[02:09:21.160 --> 02:09:26.160]  hire thuggish looking crazy-eyed looking mean people who would have you know
[02:09:26.160 --> 02:09:32.440]  slit you know their eyebrows down looking through slits hatefully when
[02:09:32.440 --> 02:09:35.600]  families drive up to a checkpoint you know time up to have them in black
[02:09:35.600 --> 02:09:38.960]  uniforms strutting around like third-world countries they've got to be
[02:09:38.960 --> 02:09:42.760]  looking at you with hate and man you pull up to these warrantless checkpoints
[02:09:42.760 --> 02:09:45.480]  now I've actually pulled up to them but they've got them all over the country and
[02:09:45.480 --> 02:09:50.920]  they'll tell you get out of that car get over there I mean they just they and you
[02:09:50.920 --> 02:09:54.120]  watch them and I've been in New York and seen the Hercules teams guys in black
[02:09:54.120 --> 02:09:57.360]  uniforms with their guns they just get off and everybody looking at them for
[02:09:57.360 --> 02:10:01.320]  those that they're for 10 hours just getting off and everyone's scared of me
[02:10:01.320 --> 02:10:06.400]  oh powerful it looks clownish to those of us that are real men and realize just
[02:10:06.400 --> 02:10:09.760]  what a pile of weak cowardice they are you see the weakness right there in front
[02:10:09.760 --> 02:10:13.080]  of you you know I mean real man wants to defend humanity is strong I want to
[02:10:13.080 --> 02:10:17.240]  stand around and bug their eyes out and and and you know cops ordering people
[02:10:17.240 --> 02:10:20.520]  around and I've been in New York a few months ago there was there was a parade
[02:10:20.520 --> 02:10:23.880]  out there when I went for a walk and they were just barking at people and
[02:10:23.880 --> 02:10:30.360]  looking at everyone I mean if I made a dystopic movie David it could not if the
[02:10:30.360 --> 02:10:34.160]  police acted this thuggish and hateful towards the public and it's not like
[02:10:34.160 --> 02:10:37.600]  this in all cities you wouldn't believe the movie because it would be too over
[02:10:37.600 --> 02:10:41.600]  the top do you see what I'm saying oh absolutely I mean we have we have reached
[02:10:41.600 --> 02:10:48.920]  the level of almost it being farcical it's a B movie we're living through and
[02:10:48.920 --> 02:10:54.760]  these people are emotional cripples you know people who are deeply deeply
[02:10:54.760 --> 02:11:02.800]  insecure have to externalize their sense of success so you know people who have
[02:11:02.800 --> 02:11:07.120]  security or secure within themselves they're happy just to live their lives
[02:11:07.120 --> 02:11:11.560]  they don't need people constantly confirming how powerful they are our
[02:11:11.560 --> 02:11:16.240]  important they are a successful they are and so the insecure people they're the
[02:11:16.240 --> 02:11:21.480]  ones that drive down the down the street at five miles an hour in there you know
[02:11:21.480 --> 02:11:25.200]  in the Bentley so everyone could see them and all that stuff because they need
[02:11:25.200 --> 02:11:30.560]  externalized confirmation that they're okay people this is why people want
[02:11:30.560 --> 02:11:33.240]  more and more money oh we've got a bigger house and oh yeah if they're
[02:11:33.240 --> 02:11:36.960]  externalizing their insecurity and you get the same process with these
[02:11:36.960 --> 02:11:41.160]  emotional cripples in uniform they're externalizing their sense of self because
[02:11:41.160 --> 02:11:46.160]  by frightening people and intimidating people and watching the people being
[02:11:46.160 --> 02:11:51.560]  intimidated they get their sense of power their sense of how big they are
[02:11:51.560 --> 02:11:55.120]  because they're just pathetic I mean they are little boys and short trousers
[02:11:55.120 --> 02:11:59.880]  that's what I see the school the playground bully you know I had a
[02:11:59.880 --> 02:12:03.960]  childhood experience for the chapter a playground bully which actually taught
[02:12:03.960 --> 02:12:08.160]  me a lot about the rest of my life actually and I you know I remember it
[02:12:08.160 --> 02:12:12.480]  you know then what happened short story or long story short is the playground
[02:12:12.480 --> 02:12:16.280]  bully turned out to be a coward and that's what these people are behind all
[02:12:16.280 --> 02:12:22.800]  this stuff and when you challenge them in the most you know pleasant way the
[02:12:22.800 --> 02:12:27.120]  taser comes out all this comes out you know the aggression comes because they
[02:12:27.120 --> 02:12:36.320]  cannot stand there apparently massive but actually very very fragile ego being
[02:12:36.320 --> 02:12:40.080]  challenged and then this is the mentality and because I travel so much
[02:12:40.080 --> 02:12:45.760]  it's everywhere it was it did the same to protesters in Melbourne and Sydney
[02:12:45.760 --> 02:12:50.240]  while I was in Australia in very recent dates the same mentality is being
[02:12:50.240 --> 02:12:54.880]  employed all over the world because it's global blueprint it is I mean that's the
[02:12:54.880 --> 02:12:59.600]  proof now they admit there's global standardization and global in
[02:12:59.600 --> 02:13:03.480]  Australia to the UK to Canada the US they take blood for now 40 years
[02:13:03.480 --> 02:13:09.200]  secretly standardization of the electronics this is global this is
[02:13:09.200 --> 02:13:14.560]  global blueprint yeah and it's very simple the way they've done it I explained
[02:13:14.560 --> 02:13:19.360]  this in my talks in my book what they've created Alex is the global version of a
[02:13:19.360 --> 02:13:23.600]  chance national corporation the headquarters at operational level is in
[02:13:23.600 --> 02:13:29.280]  Europe you places like Belgium city of London Rome Germany France and to an
[02:13:29.280 --> 02:13:32.200]  extent America but not as much as you think you know what they've done with
[02:13:32.200 --> 02:13:37.240]  America is they've said America up four guys so America fires the bullet but
[02:13:37.240 --> 02:13:40.520]  they're overwhelming loaded it yeah we've always been the big enemy because we
[02:13:40.520 --> 02:13:44.280]  went against them for a short period we're set up to take all the blame pay
[02:13:44.280 --> 02:13:48.200]  for everything and then be destroyed exactly that that that's exactly the
[02:13:48.200 --> 02:13:52.280]  story if you look at McDonald's they have headquarters in Europe and then they
[02:13:52.280 --> 02:13:58.720]  have subsidiaries in all around the world and the subsidiary has to impose the
[02:13:58.720 --> 02:14:04.200]  the corporate global blueprint of the headquarters the corporate vision the
[02:14:04.200 --> 02:14:07.960]  corporate message the corporate handbook yeah you can go to McDonald's
[02:14:07.960 --> 02:14:12.200]  in Moscow or Johannesburg or Sydney or London and you go into the same McDonald's
[02:14:12.200 --> 02:14:17.040]  now what these people at this kapala set up is exactly the same but it's a
[02:14:17.040 --> 02:14:20.920]  secret societies and bloodline families so you've got the headquarters in Europe
[02:14:20.920 --> 02:14:28.280]  what I call the spider and it takes the global agenda and the timeline
[02:14:28.280 --> 02:14:33.640]  for its unfolding then in each country you've got a network of bloodline
[02:14:33.640 --> 02:14:37.680]  families under different names and the secret society network which manipulates
[02:14:37.680 --> 02:14:42.320]  them and their agents and go for its power and their job is to impose in their
[02:14:42.320 --> 02:14:46.800]  sphere of influence their country the centrally dictated blueprint agenda and
[02:14:46.800 --> 02:14:51.320]  therefore the same things are coming in late-smart meters and all this stuff all
[02:14:51.320 --> 02:14:56.520]  over the world at the same time and then there's another level in which the
[02:14:56.520 --> 02:15:00.640]  subsidiary network in the country has subsidiary networks within the country
[02:15:00.640 --> 02:15:04.840]  that control the cities and the towns and the regions and so that it's this
[02:15:04.840 --> 02:15:09.920]  kind of a holographic blueprint where every part of the the the network is a
[02:15:09.920 --> 02:15:14.040]  smaller version of the whole but they they can orchestrate this global agenda
[02:15:14.040 --> 02:15:18.280]  through and and it's been in place now for a long time and this is where it's
[02:15:18.280 --> 02:15:24.000]  working at this is why that you'll find the same narcissistic psychopathic
[02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:28.680]  personality being being employed in law enforcement all over the world because
[02:15:28.680 --> 02:15:33.120]  it's essentially dictated through this network well they're administering the
[02:15:33.120 --> 02:15:37.480]  same psychological test and all of that's compartmentalized they say the test
[02:15:37.480 --> 02:15:41.080]  score means one thing but decoded if you look at the test I've seen articles
[02:15:41.080 --> 02:15:45.920]  it's really okay we've got a sociopath we got a psychopath we've got well is
[02:15:45.920 --> 02:15:49.800]  he a high-functioning psychopath put him in a low-level watching see if we can
[02:15:49.800 --> 02:15:53.240]  move him up because you know they don't want to control one and then they
[02:15:53.240 --> 02:15:57.320]  mainly just want dumb kind of we're the good guys do what I say all right
[02:15:57.320 --> 02:16:01.800]  these are you did you see boss did you see that's kind of like the general group
[02:16:01.800 --> 02:16:07.800]  they want on the bottom and heaven help these people it's incredible now we're
[02:16:07.800 --> 02:16:12.280]  gonna let you go and go to here in just a moment and go to Bob Chapman of
[02:16:12.280 --> 02:16:15.000]  International Forecaster and I appreciate all your time David you're gonna be
[02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:18.280]  speaking in New York coming up later people can find out in just a few days
[02:16:18.280 --> 02:16:21.960]  at DavidEig.com but in closing we keep mentioning Iran well we got a few
[02:16:21.960 --> 02:16:26.520]  minutes before the break what's happening geopolitically there the talk of the
[02:16:26.520 --> 02:16:31.480]  Euro collapsing France plots Eurozone breakup group but the breakup group is
[02:16:31.480 --> 02:16:34.880]  just the central IMF World Bank sucking everybody dry you've got the floor
[02:16:34.880 --> 02:16:39.080]  David Ike break down what's happening globally geopolitically well in terms of
[02:16:39.080 --> 02:16:43.200]  Iran you know we talked a little while ago and you put the the wishlist map
[02:16:43.200 --> 02:16:46.360]  up there and right in the middle of the wishlist of countries they wish to take
[02:16:46.360 --> 02:16:51.800]  over in that part of the world is Iran so he did an excuse and they've been
[02:16:51.800 --> 02:16:55.360]  trying to find an excuse for a long time and they've not been able to and what
[02:16:55.360 --> 02:17:00.160]  we're seeing now is like you know with Iraq it was like okay we'll have to
[02:17:00.160 --> 02:17:03.440]  explain how they've got weapons of mass destruction and then go into a bit of
[02:17:03.440 --> 02:17:06.520]  detail and all this stuff but now they've reached the point well look here's an
[02:17:06.520 --> 02:17:11.000]  excuse but I don't care if you if you don't accept it this is the excuse okay
[02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:16.000]  boys in you go and so we now have this ludicrous things like Saudi Arabian
[02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:19.240]  ambassadors being you know having their tents on their lives absolutely
[02:17:19.240 --> 02:17:23.680]  nonsense and all that stuff and I think it was very significant that this
[02:17:23.680 --> 02:17:29.920]  Zionist Elena Ross Levin the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee
[02:17:29.920 --> 02:17:36.360]  pushed through this was HR 1905 which basically makes it illegal to have
[02:17:36.360 --> 02:17:41.600]  American diplomacy with Iran and because they don't want diplomacy they don't
[02:17:41.600 --> 02:17:46.120]  want an end to it diplomatically there's an agenda to attack Iran and take over
[02:17:46.120 --> 02:17:50.080]  Iran and it's coming out of Israel which is controlled by the House of Rothschild
[02:17:50.080 --> 02:18:04.200]  is their feet and it's not the super power that it seems to be it is the
[02:18:04.200 --> 02:18:09.000]  super poodle of Israel because that's the food and with the Rothschilds who
[02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:14.040]  also control America and and Iran's on their wish list so therefore they're
[02:18:14.040 --> 02:18:17.400]  going to find a way of going in if they can't find an excuse that works they'll
[02:18:17.400 --> 02:18:21.680]  find one that doesn't we've got this international atomic agency now another
[02:18:21.680 --> 02:18:28.200]  Rothschild front that is coming up with the means and the excuse to go into
[02:18:28.200 --> 02:18:33.960]  Iran it's all building up because what they want is a third world war to come
[02:18:33.960 --> 02:18:38.280]  out of the middle and near east and what's happening on the other side now
[02:18:38.280 --> 02:18:42.640]  they're starting to move they want a war between the European Union and North
[02:18:42.640 --> 02:18:49.560]  America etc and Russia and China and now we're having the the Russian and
[02:18:49.560 --> 02:18:53.960]  Chinese authorities saying you know basically if you mess with Pakistan
[02:18:53.960 --> 02:18:59.560]  you mess with us don't don't don't go into Iran it's all building up to this
[02:18:59.560 --> 02:19:05.560]  third world conflict that they've been talking about for so long and they've
[02:19:05.560 --> 02:19:09.520]  got now this this organization called the Shanghai Corporation Cooperation
[02:19:09.520 --> 02:19:15.040]  Organization and now there are moves to bring Pakistan Iran and India into that
[02:19:15.040 --> 02:19:21.280]  and so the two sides are being very clearly created which is the Russians
[02:19:21.280 --> 02:19:26.200]  and the Chinese on one side of the European Union and North America on the
[02:19:26.200 --> 02:19:30.720]  other side exactly as they wanted and Iran if they go for that that has the
[02:19:30.720 --> 02:19:35.600]  potential for bringing these two groups of powers together and it's being done
[02:19:35.600 --> 02:19:40.560]  systematically because when you get deep into this you find that the Chinese
[02:19:40.560 --> 02:19:43.640]  are actually controlled by the same people that control America and the
[02:19:43.640 --> 02:19:47.480]  European Union now the globalists are playing everybody off against each
[02:19:47.480 --> 02:19:50.960]  other to bring in the world government David I put is one of their their
[02:19:50.960 --> 02:19:54.160]  people the Chinese are one of their people this is what the Rockefellers and

[02:24:31.240 --> 02:24:35.400]  Bob Chapman joins us for the next 40 minutes the international forecaster
[02:24:35.400 --> 02:24:40.520]  dot-com really appreciate him coming on with us got a lot of news on Iran to
[02:24:40.520 --> 02:24:44.920]  cover you know I remember reading the documents from the mid-70s where they
[02:24:44.920 --> 02:24:50.840]  said they create 10 regions within three mega regions Asia Union European Union
[02:24:50.840 --> 02:24:54.880]  North American Union America's Union and then have currency battles then merge
[02:24:54.880 --> 02:24:59.360]  those so that's how we knew what would happen but the first person I heard the
[02:24:59.360 --> 02:25:04.160]  last five years start saying they will completely collapse the euro and then
[02:25:04.160 --> 02:25:09.320]  bringing in to a new system was Bob Chapman and he joins us now here are
[02:25:09.320 --> 02:25:15.360]  the headlines and Bob really needs no introduction real finance and financial
[02:25:15.360 --> 02:25:20.720]  news expert London Telegraph France plots Eurozone breakup group now they're
[02:25:20.720 --> 02:25:24.440]  saying Italy's too big so we told you Bob told you they would snack on Ireland
[02:25:24.440 --> 02:25:29.880]  snack on Greece snack on Iceland and never having any intention and then oh
[02:25:29.880 --> 02:25:35.360]  my gosh Italy oh my gosh Spain it's too big oh my gosh so this is big this is
[02:25:35.360 --> 02:25:38.840]  gonna affect the global economy in a big way what's the plan are they in
[02:25:38.840 --> 02:25:45.840]  control how'd you predicted Bob where's it going well not in control and that's
[02:25:45.840 --> 02:25:54.640]  important their plans have gone upside down readily just overnight over the
[02:25:54.640 --> 02:25:59.040]  last six to eight weeks and that's really overnight they started printing
[02:25:59.040 --> 02:26:03.240]  their own currencies the Deutsche Mark and the Frank just in case that they
[02:26:03.240 --> 02:26:11.040]  need them and they also wanted to extend the money allocated to bail out these
[02:26:11.040 --> 02:26:19.800]  countries there was 516 billion allocated and they wanted to use derivatives
[02:26:19.800 --> 02:26:25.080]  to bring it to 1.4 trillion and I get the feeling they've given up that idea
[02:26:25.080 --> 02:26:31.520]  because of the German federal court and just the general lay in the land so to
[02:26:31.520 --> 02:26:40.120]  speak as to how Europeans feel about that so the next thing they have to do is
[02:26:40.120 --> 02:26:46.960]  to ring post their banks in each one of the countries it's just like let's
[02:26:46.960 --> 02:26:52.640]  circle the wagons and they're gonna have to bail out because they don't have an
[02:26:52.640 --> 02:26:56.720]  instrument to bail out these six countries they're gonna have to bail out
[02:26:56.720 --> 02:27:02.520]  their own banks and the reason why is is that they're so heavily invested in the
[02:27:02.520 --> 02:27:10.800]  bonds of that Lee like in the case of France and and Spain and so on and so
[02:27:10.800 --> 02:27:16.160]  how they're going to do it is they're gonna give money like they did in the
[02:27:16.160 --> 02:27:22.200]  United States to the banking structure and that'll keep them going and the
[02:27:22.200 --> 02:27:27.000]  write-offs will come they'll probably be spread over a number of years so they'll
[02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:34.680]  go into keeping two sets of books and what they're going to do is at first at
[02:27:34.680 --> 02:27:40.320]  least tell the ones the countries and they have no provision for this
[02:27:40.320 --> 02:27:45.960]  incidentally in their charter or whatever it's called and they have no
[02:27:45.960 --> 02:27:51.000]  provision for anybody to leave so they want to make provision very quickly
[02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:58.320]  that countries can default in their debt leave the Eurozone but remain in the
[02:27:58.320 --> 02:28:03.320]  European Union and they're doing that right now now the next thing that they'll
[02:28:03.320 --> 02:28:12.960]  do is try to close in and strengthen the block of Eurozone countries that allow
[02:28:12.960 --> 02:28:19.280]  which would be 11 and I would think maybe some of them might fall by the wayside
[02:28:19.280 --> 02:28:24.720]  and that's what they're gonna try to do to keep the Euro alive will it work I
[02:28:24.720 --> 02:28:32.280]  don't think so the reason why is the debt is so tremendous and at the same
[02:28:32.280 --> 02:28:39.080]  time you have the economies of the entire world but particularly in Europe in
[02:28:39.080 --> 02:28:43.680]  the United States going down and of course the export is to those areas
[02:28:43.680 --> 02:28:50.540]  they're going down in manufacturing and services and so simply put Bob
[02:28:50.540 --> 02:28:53.520]  been erupt how does it end we're seeing all these statements down by world
[02:28:53.520 --> 02:28:57.600]  leaders global depression run for the hills are they trying to just get more
[02:28:57.600 --> 02:29:00.160]  power or more bailouts out of this because they're already getting those
[02:29:00.160 --> 02:29:04.960]  or is this a genuine panic and where does what's gonna happen I think it's a
[02:29:04.960 --> 02:29:08.920]  little bit of both I think they are panic that they didn't see far enough ahead
[02:29:08.920 --> 02:29:13.480]  to do the things that they should have done to make the thing work it was put
[02:29:13.480 --> 02:29:17.840]  together like a jigsaw puzzle they won't go into it again but the point is this
[02:29:17.840 --> 02:29:22.320]  that they're having trouble controlling it and they really want to keep that
[02:29:22.320 --> 02:29:30.680]  the Euro block and so bailing out the banks nationally one by one within each
[02:29:30.680 --> 02:29:35.280]  country will be the job of each country you'll have to print money to do that
[02:29:35.280 --> 02:29:40.040]  it's going to be very inflationary but they don't care okay so what we said
[02:29:40.040 --> 02:29:44.120]  last week the signals are really getting strong for everybody to turn the
[02:29:44.120 --> 02:29:47.360]  printing presses up on high like Italy's done let's talk about what that's
[02:29:47.360 --> 02:29:52.880]  going to do and all the bank run talk we're seeing we're on the March the

[02:33:38.280 --> 02:33:45.480]  Bob Chapman is our guest today Bob it's like a dream though we've known all
[02:33:45.480 --> 02:33:49.840]  this is coming we've got the globalist documents now they're doing it world
[02:33:49.840 --> 02:33:53.840]  government's being openly announced the Vatican's calling for it all these other
[02:33:53.840 --> 02:33:59.960]  big institutions are there's incredible corruption everywhere everywhere we look
[02:33:59.960 --> 02:34:04.880]  government shipping guns into Mexico drugs back in Penn State now you know
[02:34:04.880 --> 02:34:11.160]  they're reporting and investigating donors for money with kids I mean it's
[02:34:11.160 --> 02:34:16.840]  frightening how high this evil goes and the type of webs that evil people spin
[02:34:16.840 --> 02:34:21.120]  that those of us that aren't wicked that is consciously willfully wicked we're
[02:34:21.120 --> 02:34:25.280]  all wicked in one way or another but you know the truly wicked we're blind to
[02:34:25.280 --> 02:34:31.840]  their evil and we need to be able to admit it and and and and face up to it
[02:34:31.840 --> 02:34:36.480]  or suffer the doom of so many other civilizations when these cancers are
[02:34:36.480 --> 02:34:42.240]  allowed to just grow out of control but going back to this situation in Europe
[02:34:42.240 --> 02:34:46.360]  now you were the front I'm not trying to toot your horn you know I don't do this
[02:34:46.360 --> 02:34:51.000]  with all of our guests but but pretty much all of our regular guests are people
[02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:54.000]  who've been accurate over and over again that's who I keep going back to the
[02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:59.040]  well-on but I remember you a year ago saying or more than a year that US
[02:34:59.040 --> 02:35:02.520]  embassies were quietly getting a whole bunch of recurrences together I remember
[02:35:02.520 --> 02:35:07.360]  you close to a year ago saying that Germany and France others were looking
[02:35:07.360 --> 02:35:11.880]  at printing up their old currency now that's finally come out in the news that
[02:35:11.880 --> 02:35:17.320]  they've been doing that so you've got a lot of sources out there what do you
[02:35:17.320 --> 02:35:22.920]  expect to happen now in a limited range what do you think's going to happen
[02:35:22.920 --> 02:35:26.920]  next in Europe and what do you say to those that email me and say stop talking
[02:35:26.920 --> 02:35:30.960]  about Europe it doesn't affect us they don't understand that half the bailout
[02:35:30.960 --> 02:35:34.040]  money we paid went to Europe they don't understand that the whole economy is
[02:35:34.040 --> 02:35:39.000]  global and connected and then expanding out from there people pulling their
[02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:44.120]  money out of the mega banks more and more talk of bank closures what about
[02:35:44.120 --> 02:35:52.000]  bank runs well bank runs are possible but today and they learned from what went
[02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:57.920]  on during the 30s and at other times and what they do is where it's the banks are
[02:35:57.920 --> 02:36:02.040]  going to take a moment so the run doesn't happen toward the end that won't
[02:36:02.040 --> 02:36:07.480]  work but at least for the time being it will as far as Europe's concerned they
[02:36:07.480 --> 02:36:12.720]  going to allow these six countries to lead the European Union go back to the
[02:36:12.720 --> 02:36:19.200]  original currencies and but they'll they'll be out of the eurozone and then
[02:36:19.200 --> 02:36:23.240]  they'll have their tight little group left within the eurozone and hopefully
[02:36:23.240 --> 02:36:28.200]  that will function to them and they'll still have the euro but I don't think
[02:36:28.200 --> 02:36:33.120]  that's going to work out that way and as I said earlier the banks are the
[02:36:33.120 --> 02:36:37.680]  problem and they have to refinance the banks and in that process they have very
[02:36:37.680 --> 02:36:42.960]  very high inflation and yes it does affect us in the United States because
[02:36:42.960 --> 02:36:49.560]  we export we do a lot of business with Europe and then on top of that what's
[02:36:49.560 --> 02:36:56.200]  going to happen is that the banks of New York and you know the figure was a
[02:36:56.200 --> 02:37:00.160]  hundred and seventy billion and right now it's like five hundred and fifty
[02:37:00.160 --> 02:37:07.320]  billion dollars worth of credit to fall swaps that were written most of it just
[02:37:07.320 --> 02:37:15.480]  in the last several months on debt of these countries that had sold a debt
[02:37:15.480 --> 02:37:20.760]  that was questionable that was bought by France and and other stronger countries
[02:37:20.760 --> 02:37:28.080]  and so what these banks have done in New York for whatever reason is they're
[02:37:28.080 --> 02:37:38.160]  covering a lot of the losses so if these banks default in these six countries then
[02:37:38.160 --> 02:37:43.920]  the amount of money that's going to be lost is probably two or three trillion
[02:37:43.920 --> 02:37:50.920]  dollars but the banks in New York are going to pay insurance on five hundred
[02:37:50.920 --> 02:37:55.880]  billion of that so it is going to affect us five hundred billion dollars is a lot
[02:37:55.880 --> 02:38:01.360]  of money even for banks and so what's going to happen is that they're going
[02:38:01.360 --> 02:38:05.480]  to have to get bailed out again as well because they're operating on two sets of
[02:38:05.480 --> 02:38:09.960]  books already just like the banks in Europe and they're all insolvent at the
[02:38:09.960 --> 02:38:14.640]  present time and so this would just make them more insolvent so that is going to
[02:38:14.640 --> 02:38:19.160]  affect you because if the government needs the money they go to the Fed they
[02:38:19.160 --> 02:38:24.320]  print it up so to speak out of thin air the money goes back to the Treasury or
[02:38:24.320 --> 02:38:29.400]  directly from the Fed to the banks and they use that money to function to keep
[02:38:29.400 --> 02:38:33.880]  from going under but there's two sides to everything and the other side is
[02:38:33.880 --> 02:38:39.880]  massive inflation and that's why today the stock markets way up two hundred and
[02:38:39.880 --> 02:38:44.800]  seventy six points but gold is up over thirty dollars making up yesterday's
[02:38:44.800 --> 02:38:53.280]  loss you can't keep it down why because people see what's going to happen so
[02:38:53.280 --> 02:38:57.920]  where does it go short-term and then long-term Bob short term I think you'll
[02:38:57.920 --> 02:39:05.960]  have a negative hiatus for the next two to three months and then they'll go into
[02:39:05.960 --> 02:39:08.920]  action and they're going to tell you what they're going to do or at least what
[02:39:08.920 --> 02:39:17.200]  they want you to know and and then after that it'll get worse again and so we'll
[02:39:17.200 --> 02:39:22.920]  probably the nations in Europe that are not insolvent will go sideways the
[02:39:22.920 --> 02:39:30.800]  ones that are insolvent will start going under how will the establishment
[02:39:30.800 --> 02:39:36.760]  respond to that launch a new war is a political distraction could be as we all
[02:39:36.760 --> 02:39:45.160]  know the Israelis have been making noises again and I thought the comment
[02:39:45.160 --> 02:39:51.920]  in the private conversation between Mr. Thakouzi and Mr. Obama was very
[02:39:51.920 --> 02:39:58.000]  telling when this guy is a liar and the other the other guy says well I got to
[02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:03.920]  talk to him every day you get off easy but anyway sure they're planning a war
[02:40:03.920 --> 02:40:13.720]  they got to take out Syria first and that could trigger a third world war as a
[02:40:13.720 --> 02:40:19.240]  Russian base there is Russia prepared as China prepared and of course they know
[02:40:19.240 --> 02:40:24.800]  what's going on their intelligence services I promise you are just as good
[02:40:24.800 --> 02:40:30.120]  as ours at least the Russians are and so we don't know which way they got a role
[02:40:30.120 --> 02:40:36.000]  on this one are they gonna go to war against America with their friends in
[02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:41.560]  the brick nations I think it's a toss-up I just don't know well Bob let's go back
[02:40:41.560 --> 02:40:45.880]  I mean personally personally I mean that earlier in the week I didn't really
[02:40:45.880 --> 02:40:51.200]  cover that I should have but my gut is that they know Israel is strongly
[02:40:51.200 --> 02:40:55.040]  looking at hitting Iran and it said they will and the West wants some
[02:40:55.040 --> 02:41:00.840]  plausible deniability but Obama and Sarkozy are overheard by the blogger
[02:41:00.840 --> 02:41:05.280]  and then Reuters confirms I mean don't you think that that's just an attempt to
[02:41:05.280 --> 02:41:10.920]  leak that out to then act like the West wasn't involved in this well it's not
[02:41:10.920 --> 02:41:19.480]  only that it's a distraction and it's a reason to keep their heel on Israel to
[02:41:19.480 --> 02:41:26.840]  keep them from attacking Iran or others and I think more than anything else it
[02:41:26.840 --> 02:41:32.280]  was a warning but you know look we can expose you anytime we want
[02:41:33.520 --> 02:41:37.840]  all right I want to bring Ted Anderson in here and then I'm gonna get into some
[02:41:37.840 --> 02:41:42.800]  other news with you concerning the police state Bob Chapman but I wanted
[02:41:42.800 --> 02:41:47.000]  to bring Ted Anderson up here with us of course 30 plus years in gold and
[02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:53.440]  silver business as well I don't know 14 15 years with minus resources Ted looking
[02:41:53.440 --> 02:41:57.200]  at this situation that you're seeing in the world right now gold and silver
[02:41:57.200 --> 02:42:02.280]  steadily rising in the last few weeks again they can drive it down for a few
[02:42:02.280 --> 02:42:07.360]  months by right raising the margin call on speculation but then that just runs
[02:42:07.360 --> 02:42:12.040]  out the speculators who a lot of times are actually driving down the price so
[02:42:12.040 --> 02:42:18.000]  tell us where golden silver is right now what gold is at 1787 90 Alex had hit a
[02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:24.760]  high today of 1789 60 low today of 1761 70 actually it opened up at that because
[02:42:24.760 --> 02:42:28.680]  yesterday was a corrective day where gold hit a bottom somewhere around that
[02:42:28.680 --> 02:42:34.040]  1760 range and then came shooting right back up silver today right now is at
[02:42:34.040 --> 02:42:43.120]  3482 seeing a high today of 3495 low today of 3378 gold is up $28.90 right
[02:42:43.120 --> 02:42:48.360]  now presently sober up 69 cents but Bob is right I mean Indians right now in
[02:42:48.360 --> 02:42:53.440]  India I'm talking about not a Native American Indian are fleeing bonds right
[02:42:53.440 --> 02:42:58.040]  now and they're going into gold in a big way like to the tune of 78.7 billion
[02:42:58.040 --> 02:43:03.360]  rupees I was over there earlier this year not in India but in Singapore and I
[02:43:03.360 --> 02:43:07.080]  looked into those gold shops where they had that 24 karat gold chain hanging
[02:43:07.080 --> 02:43:11.320]  there and then it was just jam-packed full but what's going on here right here
[02:43:11.320 --> 02:43:16.760]  in the United States is the largest municipality ever just filed bankruptcy
[02:43:16.760 --> 02:43:21.120]  Alabama Jefferson County just filed bankruptcy and that's going to be a
[02:43:21.120 --> 02:43:26.680]  huge effect on the economy because I mean when those big men in municipalities
[02:43:26.680 --> 02:43:30.480]  start to fall apart you look at others I mean we all know that California is in
[02:43:30.480 --> 02:43:34.680]  trouble there's a whole long list of states here just in the United States
[02:43:34.680 --> 02:43:38.960]  that are having problems bonds are a dangerous play right now people are
[02:43:38.960 --> 02:43:43.080]  starting to look at that not only here but in the world and that's why you see
[02:43:43.080 --> 02:43:47.440]  this flee India is specifically are getting out of bonds and going straight
[02:43:47.440 --> 02:43:53.860]  to gold well they certainly are and and look you know every time that they
[02:43:53.860 --> 02:44:00.440]  artificially drive down the price of gold and silver I always point out that
[02:44:00.440 --> 02:44:03.640]  if you look at the 10 12-year graph five-year graph to your graphics it's
[02:44:03.640 --> 02:44:08.640]  going straight up they'll dip it for a while but then it always continues if
[02:44:08.640 --> 02:44:14.080]  you look at the larger graph I mean that's simple gold was $260 11 years
[02:44:14.080 --> 02:44:19.840]  ago now it's you know 1800 or whatever silver was $5 now it's 30 something
[02:44:19.840 --> 02:44:23.920]  speculatively it you and ran up to ride at 50 but then went back down the point
[02:44:23.920 --> 02:44:28.960]  is it's because globally and I know I talk like I'm talking to five-year-olds
[02:44:28.960 --> 02:44:34.920]  but I get calls email some people still don't understand this oil housing gold
[02:44:34.920 --> 02:44:40.480]  silver all this stuff even if we're in a depression is going to go up in price
[02:44:40.480 --> 02:44:48.160]  because they're they're massively moving towards devaluing the currencies and so
[02:44:48.160 --> 02:44:54.520]  passion of the 1930s gold went from $22 an ounce to $36 an ounce because in
[02:44:54.520 --> 02:44:58.760]  order for the United States to gain that world currency we had to have something
[02:44:58.760 --> 02:45:03.520]  that was still backed by gold they they artificially just increase the price
[02:45:03.520 --> 02:45:06.320]  for the Bretton Woods agreement but that's what we're going to be back
[02:45:06.320 --> 02:45:09.760]  looking at again because the United States currency this time is going to be
[02:45:09.760 --> 02:45:16.360]  taking a hit when we have this economic crisis well you're right Ted but but
[02:45:16.360 --> 02:45:22.240]  again people need to understand that if the signals being given that on top of
[02:45:22.240 --> 02:45:25.840]  all of the devaluation and money putting we've seen that all these major
[02:45:25.840 --> 02:45:30.640]  nations are now going to basically have a race in devaluing their currencies I
[02:45:30.640 --> 02:45:37.600]  mean gold could go up to stratospheric levels I mean if people think 1800 bucks
[02:45:37.600 --> 02:45:42.480]  an ounce is a lot now Bob I mean I'm even seeing mainstream media now kind of
[02:45:42.480 --> 02:45:46.920]  talk like Bob Chapman or some of the other economists we have on I mean use
[02:45:46.920 --> 02:45:50.760]  the signal really being given a summer saying to now really accelerate the
[02:45:50.760 --> 02:45:57.000]  printing of money well I have to and it's going to be worldwide it's the only
[02:45:57.000 --> 02:46:03.080]  way that they can continue to reorganize as I call it the banking entities
[02:46:03.080 --> 02:46:08.120]  with me within each country and they'll link them up again later like they did
[02:46:08.120 --> 02:46:14.320]  previously but the expansion of money and credit is going to continue to
[02:46:14.320 --> 02:46:19.600]  monetize and continue to cause inflation you know the US may say real
[02:46:19.600 --> 02:46:24.440]  inflation is 3.8% when in fact they know it's not and so does and everybody in
[02:46:24.440 --> 02:46:30.040]  Wall Street Washington so what do they got they got 11.4 11.6 and that's
[02:46:30.040 --> 02:46:35.320]  really high inflation and it's going to get worse and what does that do like
[02:46:35.320 --> 02:46:41.680]  Alex said it drives money into other things people don't want to hold cash
[02:46:41.680 --> 02:46:48.040]  and to me the only place to be is gold and silver coins billion in shares and
[02:46:48.040 --> 02:46:54.320]  that's it there is no place else to go as far as I'm concerned Ted we're going
[02:46:54.320 --> 02:46:56.880]  to break here in a moment I'm gonna come back and hit a few final news items
[02:46:56.880 --> 02:47:03.160]  with Bob Chapman that are of particular import but I believe people need to get
[02:47:03.160 --> 02:47:08.240]  involved in golden silver now I buy my golden silver for Midas Resources I am
[02:47:08.240 --> 02:47:13.480]  proud to promote Midas Resources I only promote what I believe for myself is a
[02:47:13.480 --> 02:47:18.240]  great decision I don't have a crystal ball I'm not perfect but I think I'm
[02:47:18.240 --> 02:47:20.880]  giving people good advice to get into golden silver and the best place to get
[02:47:20.880 --> 02:47:26.120]  it is Midas Resources I hope people do not wait as the economy globally slides
[02:47:26.120 --> 02:47:32.200]  into the into oblivion now is the time to get golden silver from my research I
[02:47:32.200 --> 02:47:37.040]  mean people think gold was too much to buy at $500 an ounce no well I waited too
[02:47:37.040 --> 02:47:42.240]  long I won't get it then it was too much at 800 or a thousand or 1200 or 14 15
[02:47:42.240 --> 02:47:49.880]  16 17 1800 it's not that gold's gone up it's that the dollar has gone down in
[02:47:49.880 --> 02:47:53.160]  value I know that's simple but people still don't understand as they say well
[02:47:53.160 --> 02:47:58.400]  then why does Ted Anderson want fellow reserve notes for gold well that that's
[02:47:58.400 --> 02:48:03.280]  a silly silly childlike Cointel prose statement obviously Ted Anderson for his
[02:48:03.280 --> 02:48:07.440]  investment buys golden silver one of his main investments myself included just
[02:48:07.440 --> 02:48:11.240]  not as an investment but as an emergency fund backup for my family and this
[02:48:11.240 --> 02:48:16.400]  operation but obviously it's taking more of those fellow reserve notes every day
[02:48:16.400 --> 02:48:21.920]  to get that gold and then that's the currency we traded in okay but then as
[02:48:21.920 --> 02:48:26.920]  that dollar dies or as it's devalued we have the real store of wealth now so
[02:48:26.920 --> 02:48:30.200]  you're putting something that's transitory easily manipulated into
[02:48:30.200 --> 02:48:33.960]  something historically that has a lot more value than fiat currencies it's a
[02:48:33.960 --> 02:48:38.840]  very elementary Ted Anderson tell people the big list of golden silver coins
[02:48:38.840 --> 02:48:42.720]  you've got these are the radio specials these are not even on the internet
[02:48:42.720 --> 02:48:46.240]  except for one of the two silver coins in the book in the video deal that is on
[02:48:46.240 --> 02:48:49.680]  the internet at info wars.com you see the get two silver dollars get two free
[02:48:49.680 --> 02:48:53.840]  gifts free that is the only one of these deals available on the web Ted tell
[02:48:53.840 --> 02:48:58.160]  folks about the radio specials yeah well I mean one of the obvious things to do
[02:48:58.160 --> 02:49:03.400]  is to pick up that fifth of an ounce of gold at that frank coin for $389 just
[02:49:03.400 --> 02:49:07.120]  due to the fact that you get a full year subscription to Bob's newsletter the
[02:49:07.120 --> 02:49:11.200]  international forecaster I mean that's like buying gold at $1000 an ounce and
[02:49:11.200 --> 02:49:16.320]  we all know that it's trading closer to $1800 an ounce but it is still Alex I
[02:49:16.320 --> 02:49:21.480]  think it's very important that people have circulated silver dimes it's just a
[02:49:21.480 --> 02:49:25.440]  small piece of silver that can be used in the market you know for buying
[02:49:25.440 --> 02:49:30.200]  whatever you need 2625 and what a ridiculous statement why would I take
[02:49:30.200 --> 02:49:33.480]  Federal Reserve notes for gold and silver there may be a time in the future
[02:49:33.480 --> 02:49:37.440]  where I won't be able to because the dollars lost that much purchasing power
[02:49:37.440 --> 02:49:41.440]  but that's like asking why would the grocery store sell groceries when they
[02:49:41.440 --> 02:49:44.680]  know they have to eat you know it's obviously that the business of the
[02:49:44.680 --> 02:49:49.560]  production is what makes it valuable and and there's no question about it people
[02:49:49.560 --> 02:49:53.200]  should be getting into it at this particular time US Eagles right now
[02:49:53.200 --> 02:49:58.000]  Gold Eagles currently right now are trading at 1951 the walking Liberty
[02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:03.440]  half I have a special going on at 1694 which is $3 less than what I have on
[02:50:03.440 --> 02:50:07.400]  my website you know there's a lot of different things I think the campaign
[02:50:07.400 --> 02:50:11.600]  for Liberty coin is a valuable coin even if you just have one it comes in a
[02:50:11.600 --> 02:50:16.520]  leatherette case and it just you know it supports the campaign for Liberty you
[02:50:16.520 --> 02:50:19.920]  know that's Ron Paul's movement how many people would like to see Ron Paul be
[02:50:19.920 --> 02:50:22.800]  elected for president well you're right Ted let me give people the toll free
[02:50:22.800 --> 02:50:27.400]  number before we go into the final segment it's 800 686 2237 and there's

[02:50:36.040 --> 02:50:39.160]  yeah how much is it for the two silver dollars and the book in the video now
[02:50:39.160 --> 02:50:43.240]  seventy three dollars I'm still holding that out even though prices have gone up
[02:50:43.240 --> 02:50:47.000]  over ten dollars in silver when I marked it at that level yeah folks give them a

[02:54:35.320 --> 02:54:39.160]  especially in the northern hemisphere going way up we're gonna look at the
[02:54:39.160 --> 02:54:45.120]  latest on the Penn State situation and a lot more also there's some new CIA
[02:54:45.120 --> 02:54:48.360]  briefing videos for Ronald Reagan that came out that you think are like mr.
[02:54:48.360 --> 02:54:55.160]  Rogers this is the Kremlin mr. president it's it's that's up on info wars.com
[02:54:55.160 --> 02:54:58.800]  we're gonna play some clips of that tonight going back to Bob Chapman Bob
[02:54:58.800 --> 02:55:03.480]  side issue but your guy who's been around the world seen a lot of things and
[02:55:03.480 --> 02:55:09.040]  you've talked about the degeneracy of the global elite and and I remember here
[02:55:09.040 --> 02:55:12.240]  in this when I first got involved and really awake 17 years ago and I was
[02:55:12.240 --> 02:55:16.720]  like no no it's not true but it really is everywhere but working in US
[02:55:16.720 --> 02:55:20.200]  intelligence and then after that is the biggest private silver and gold broker
[02:55:20.200 --> 02:55:26.360]  and living all over the world I keep running into pedophiles at the highest
[02:55:26.360 --> 02:55:29.800]  levels everywhere and they can't be more than a half percentage point of the
[02:55:29.800 --> 02:55:35.440]  population from what I've researched I mean who are these people are they as
[02:55:35.440 --> 02:55:40.920]  prevalent as it looks like and what do you chalk it up to with this whole Penn
[02:55:40.920 --> 02:55:49.560]  State thing well it's hard to tell the origin of the motivation of the
[02:55:49.560 --> 02:55:57.200]  individual and others involved a lot of bad decisions were made by offices of
[02:55:57.200 --> 02:56:05.640]  the university who are gone and the football coach he decided to keep his
[02:56:05.640 --> 02:56:11.040]  mouth shut and protect I guess his friend and they cost him his whole career
[02:56:11.040 --> 02:56:19.440]  really and it's a shame that that's Tracy made it was wrong the the prevalence
[02:56:19.440 --> 02:56:28.200]  of of pedophilia at high levels has been there for many many years I've seen
[02:56:28.200 --> 02:56:37.240]  studies going back into the 1920s in the Midwest and Boys Town and then starting
[02:56:37.240 --> 02:56:44.400]  in the 1950s kidnapping children never to be seen again who were used in these
[02:56:44.400 --> 02:56:51.720]  sort of things and I think what happens at the top people feel that they're all
[02:56:51.720 --> 02:57:02.800]  powerful they have experienced normal and abnormal sex with both genders and
[02:57:02.800 --> 02:57:09.000]  they decided that it's time that they tried it out on children who are
[02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:15.560]  harmless I mean they can't fight back and it gives them a sense of empowerment
[02:57:15.560 --> 02:57:23.080]  and at the same time the other things that are involved for the re the whoever
[02:57:23.080 --> 02:57:30.240]  brings this thing forward and so at the top you see lots of it and I know George
[02:57:30.240 --> 02:57:37.200]  Bush isn't gonna like this but him and his father are real creatures and I'm
[02:57:37.200 --> 02:57:42.080]  sure I'll hear about it but that's just too bad and his father is unbelievable I
[02:57:42.080 --> 02:57:54.760]  went into a shop in Rome and it was 1984 and I was looking at the newspaper and
[02:57:54.760 --> 02:58:01.680]  actually I was on my way to observator Romano which is a newspaper there and
[02:58:01.680 --> 02:58:06.680]  there were several newspapers that said Henry Kissing is coming to town
[02:58:06.680 --> 02:58:12.760]  hide your children I mean this is national newspapers now you don't see
[02:58:12.760 --> 02:58:18.320]  that in America but I actually saw that in a shop that sells newspapers in Rome
[02:58:18.320 --> 02:58:22.120]  well we know what goes on a Bohemian Grove right there so you know if I
[02:58:22.120 --> 02:58:24.600]  didn't see some evidence of what you're saying how to shut you down right there
[02:58:24.600 --> 02:58:28.000]  Bob it's it's incredible either special report on it last night it's at
[02:58:28.000 --> 02:58:31.880]  prisonplanet.tv and I've got video of a family court judge saying to the father
[02:58:31.880 --> 02:58:36.440]  and the mother I don't like how you're acting I'm just gonna take your children
[02:58:36.440 --> 02:58:40.120]  your children belong to me and he just gets on a big power trip see you back
