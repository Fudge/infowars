[01:39.400 --> 01:43.960]  about the fight between freedom and liberty and the collectivist and the
[01:43.960 --> 01:47.760]  tyrants that are trying to take over our society and Rush Limbaugh is talking
[01:47.760 --> 01:53.040]  about Obama might try to suspend elections I mean they're going to lose so
[01:53.040 --> 01:56.280]  the only way they could try to get away with this is to suspend elections
[01:56.280 --> 02:00.560]  they're trying to demonize the tea parties the patriots no doubt they're
[02:00.560 --> 02:04.000]  staging many of these break through the window events Democrats have been caught
[02:04.000 --> 02:07.600]  doing this before there is a lot of anger out there violence is not the
[02:07.600 --> 02:12.120]  answer judge Napolitano great to have you here with us Alex it's a pleasure
[02:12.120 --> 02:17.800]  what a fabulous intro man I'm riveted listening to you well we're riveted
[02:17.800 --> 02:21.200]  having you here okay I could bring up a lot of subjects but what's important to
[02:21.200 --> 02:25.640]  you right now what do you what's number one on your front burner the the loss
[02:25.640 --> 02:28.880]  of freedom at the hands of the government which happens with every tick
[02:28.880 --> 02:32.160]  of the clock I kiddingly say in the beginning of that book which you were
[02:32.160 --> 02:37.040]  very kind to to mention Alex that when I told friends I was writing a book about
[02:37.040 --> 02:41.200]  the government and lies and that it was 4,000 pages long everybody laughed and
[02:41.200 --> 02:44.440]  said were you able to get all the lies in the 4,000 pages of course the
[02:44.440 --> 02:49.360]  publisher made the publisher made me stop at 300 pages but it shows you the
[02:49.360 --> 02:55.000]  the the perception that the public has is that the government does lie to us
[02:55.000 --> 03:00.320]  has been lying to us and we accept these lies and are willing to laugh about it
[03:00.320 --> 03:04.040]  even though every one of those lies I talk about in the book and even many
[03:04.040 --> 03:07.480]  that you just mentioned in the introduction destroys our liberty
[03:07.480 --> 03:12.480]  destroys our freedom by inducing us to make political decisions on erroneous
[03:12.480 --> 03:17.240]  information that the government claims is true and when we give up this liberty
[03:17.240 --> 03:23.960]  and lose this property we don't get it back absolutely when we come back I
[03:23.960 --> 03:26.960]  want to get into the health care bill I want to talk about what's next for these
[03:26.960 --> 03:32.320]  guys the blanket amnesty the national worker ID for citizens that illegals are
[03:32.320 --> 03:36.400]  exempt from I've read the bill it's the same thing in this bill the health care
[03:36.400 --> 03:41.440]  bill it talks about how we have to have an electronic medical ID card but it
[03:41.440 --> 03:47.920]  says illegals are again exempt from that no surprise that they would do
[03:47.920 --> 03:53.800]  something like that in order a to control us be to know where we are and
[03:53.800 --> 03:59.280]  what we're doing and see to create a permanent underclass fully dependent
[03:59.280 --> 04:02.560]  upon them the next thing you know is that they'll allow those folks to vote
[04:02.560 --> 04:06.680]  and you know which way they'll vote in favor of the party or the group or the
[04:06.680 --> 04:10.880]  candidate that gives them as big a piece of the pie to which we contribute at the
[04:10.880 --> 04:17.680]  point of a gun judge Andrew Napolitano the new book lies the government told

[06:08.880 --> 06:12.800]  we're back for the rest of the hour Judge Andrew Napolitano is our guest the new book
[06:12.800 --> 06:19.000]  lies the government told you myth power and deception American history judge I
[06:19.000 --> 06:24.560]  get up here every day and rant and rave and and actually cover the laws the
[06:24.560 --> 06:28.960]  subsections the bills I give people chapter and verse and still some call
[06:28.960 --> 06:33.720]  in and say are you really telling the truth here's page 65 of the signed bill
[06:33.720 --> 06:41.240]  and it's in section bi eligibility for health plan and this is the actual
[06:41.240 --> 06:45.800]  section of the bill and it says mail out for the use of a machine readable
[06:45.800 --> 06:50.880]  identification card and they have another bill where they make citizens have
[06:50.880 --> 06:57.040]  a national ID card to have a job but the illegals are exempt and you have a
[06:57.040 --> 07:05.480]  what 8% approval rating for read 10% for Pelosi 11% for Congress they know that
[07:05.480 --> 07:09.680]  80% of the public is against this health care takeover we know the insurance
[07:09.680 --> 07:15.200]  companies wrote it it's actually a scam the establishment knows what they're
[07:15.200 --> 07:18.880]  doing is unconstitutional and lawless but they're going ahead with it and
[07:18.880 --> 07:23.080]  that's why Rush Limbaugh and I agree with him I'm glad he's really coming out
[07:23.080 --> 07:28.160]  now and telling it like it is great said that they may suspend elections
[07:28.160 --> 07:32.280]  because he says there's no way they they can win and that it appears they're
[07:32.280 --> 07:36.800]  putting in a police state control grid but as you know this was all set up in
[07:36.800 --> 07:41.640]  the last 20 30 years in this nation it's bipartisan Judge Napolitano what is
[07:41.640 --> 07:45.880]  the state of our union the state of our union is that it is a bipartisan
[07:45.880 --> 07:49.600]  movement toward a police state and we don't have two parties in this country
[07:49.600 --> 07:53.880]  Alex even though most people think we do your listeners know that we have one
[07:53.880 --> 07:58.760]  party the big government party there's a Republican wing that likes war and
[07:58.760 --> 08:02.880]  deficits and assaults our civil liberties there's a Democratic wing that
[08:02.880 --> 08:07.080]  likes welfare and taxes and assaults our commercial liberties but they basically
[08:07.080 --> 08:11.040]  will feed each other because they're not interested in freedom they don't
[08:11.040 --> 08:15.720]  believe in fidelity to the Constitution they're just interested in power I mean
[08:15.720 --> 08:20.160]  on my radio show last month I asked the number three ranking Democrat in the
[08:20.160 --> 08:24.680]  House of Representatives congressman Jim Clyburn congressman where in the
[08:24.680 --> 08:28.960]  Constitution is the government authorized to regulate health care and he
[08:28.960 --> 08:33.560]  said to me judge most of what we do down here referring to Washington is not
[08:33.560 --> 08:38.280]  authorized by the Constitution where in the Constitution is it prohibited that
[08:38.280 --> 08:44.920]  we regulate health care the very fact that he would ask that question shows a
[08:44.920 --> 08:49.920]  create tremendous 180 degree misunderstanding of the federal government
[08:49.920 --> 08:55.000]  the Congress is not a general legislature it doesn't exist in order to
[08:55.000 --> 09:01.200]  right every wrong it exists only to exercise power in 17 unique discreet
[09:01.200 --> 09:06.320]  specific well-defined set out areas and a piece of paper called the
[09:06.320 --> 09:11.320]  Constitution to which he took an oath to uphold at least he was candid enough to
[09:11.320 --> 09:16.520]  acknowledge they're not upholding it but what is to become of us Alex if the
[09:16.520 --> 09:22.520]  government decides the extent of its own powers if the government freely admits
[09:22.520 --> 09:28.280]  it violates its oath to uphold the Constitution and if whenever financial
[09:28.280 --> 09:33.600]  or civil liberties are involved both sides of the government Republican and
[09:33.600 --> 09:38.560]  Democrat agree the president signs a new Patriot Act and he signs it in the
[09:38.560 --> 09:42.760]  undercover of darkness because he's afraid those to whom he promised he
[09:42.760 --> 09:47.000]  wouldn't do so might see a picture of him of him doing it the president when
[09:47.000 --> 09:51.160]  he was a senator blasted George W. Bush for conducting an illegal war he's
[09:51.160 --> 09:56.680]  killed as many people as Bush ever did and it's sending drones to to Pakistan
[09:56.680 --> 10:02.000]  in more so in one year than Bush did in eight there there is very little change
[10:02.000 --> 10:08.200]  that comes about the elections in this country unless and until people well
[10:08.200 --> 10:14.080]  there is very little change judge and once they start violating the Bill of
[10:14.080 --> 10:17.800]  Rights and Constitution the sky is the limit as you know as a constitutional
[10:17.800 --> 10:21.480]  law scholar and as a judge but the general public is just now beginning to
[10:21.480 --> 10:25.840]  discover this what about last week when they were still trying to just deem and
[10:25.840 --> 10:31.440]  pass this whole thing without even having the House vote on it I mean at
[10:31.440 --> 10:37.120]  least we forced them to back off of that but that gives us a window into their
[10:37.120 --> 10:43.520]  lawless mindset exactly it shows us that they would have caused to become law
[10:43.520 --> 10:48.200]  not only that which they haven't read and we know they haven't read it because
[10:48.200 --> 10:51.800]  they made promises that their their scriveners found out last night aren't
[10:51.800 --> 10:55.640]  in there but that they haven't even voted on at least we shamed them into
[10:55.640 --> 11:01.440]  voting on it at least we know that Bart Stupak is no more pro-life than Barack
[11:01.440 --> 11:06.560]  Obama at least we know where people truly stand on all of this because the
[11:06.560 --> 11:10.720]  the uproar from people all across the political spectrum forced them to vote
[11:10.720 --> 11:15.700]  how odd and quaint Alex that our representatives should actually vote
[11:15.700 --> 11:20.120]  on something and that we should be able to know how they voted you know when
[11:20.120 --> 11:25.840]  the extension of the Patriot Act was enacted in the Senate it was done by a
[11:25.840 --> 11:31.320]  voice vote so that no senator was recorded as to how he or she voted on
[11:31.320 --> 11:34.360]  it and when they changed the the definition of the word financial
[11:34.360 --> 11:38.440]  institution to mean a doctor's office a lawyer's office the post office a
[11:38.440 --> 11:42.440]  computer server anything under the war under the sun which would let them serve
[11:42.440 --> 11:46.640]  a self-written search warrant on it that vote was taken by voice vote so there's
[11:46.640 --> 11:51.320]  no record of how anybody voted on it at least this time we have a record so we
[11:51.320 --> 11:57.440]  want to vote the bums out we know who the bums are and on top of that we have
[11:57.440 --> 12:03.600]  bills in the last decade introduced to make them read the bills act and they
[12:03.600 --> 12:10.400]  fight that you know that Ron Paul introduces every year two simple four
[12:10.400 --> 12:15.880]  line bills every member of Congress shall certify under oath that he or she
[12:15.880 --> 12:20.440]  has read a bill before voting for or against it and every bill this is the
[12:20.440 --> 12:24.800]  second one that is introduced must cite in the Constitution the authority for
[12:24.800 --> 12:30.680]  the bill neither of those proposals as simple basic and rational as could be a
[12:30.680 --> 12:35.240]  junior in high school social studies could understand them neither of those
[12:35.240 --> 12:39.520]  have seen the light of day neither of them ever makes it to a committee for
[12:39.520 --> 12:43.040]  hearing but there may be some hope because you could have said the same
[12:43.040 --> 12:48.400]  thing about his proposal to audit the Fed 10 years ago now it has passed the
[12:48.400 --> 12:51.880]  House of Representatives what will happen in the Senate I don't know but his
[12:51.880 --> 12:56.040]  persistence has caused the American public to be aware of these things and
[12:56.040 --> 13:01.440]  caused the public to pressure power hungry members of Congress occasionally to
[13:01.440 --> 13:07.680]  do the right thing judge Andrew Napolitano as a constitutional expert as
[13:07.680 --> 13:14.320]  a former judge reading over the bill and over the subsections there's so many
[13:14.320 --> 13:19.840]  things that are unconstitutional and then there's also deception even the AP
[13:19.840 --> 13:26.240]  admits this doesn't protect people with self with with already existing
[13:26.240 --> 13:31.960]  conditions with children that is the one that Mrs. Pelosi and company are
[13:31.960 --> 13:37.720]  stumbling over this morning Alex because they promised Democrats and the
[13:37.720 --> 13:42.720]  Democrats promised their constituents that children with pre-existing
[13:42.720 --> 13:47.640]  conditions would be covered immediately now put aside the fact that the federal
[13:47.640 --> 13:53.240]  government has no authority whatsoever take it to the bank no authority
[13:53.240 --> 13:58.360]  whatsoever to regulate health care and to tell insurance carriers who they may
[13:58.360 --> 14:02.680]  ensure but even if you're for socialism this is another ripoff just like
[14:02.680 --> 14:06.880]  communism under the Soviets was a ripoff or socialism in England's a ripoff
[14:06.880 --> 14:10.640]  anytime they get a big pool of money they're gonna steal most of it they're
[14:10.640 --> 14:13.840]  not gonna give it of course because sooner or later you run out of other
[14:13.840 --> 14:18.160]  people's money but in this particular case they lied to their own people the
[14:18.160 --> 14:22.520]  yeah sure was monstrosity that they passed didn't even have in it the
[14:22.520 --> 14:27.520]  clauses that they used to sell it on the American people one of which is this
[14:27.520 --> 14:31.520]  your children will be taken care of from the minute the president signs it
[14:31.520 --> 14:35.880]  baloney they didn't even read what they wrote they didn't even write what they
[14:35.880 --> 14:39.880]  wrote they just took passages and put it together by the way did you hear who
[14:39.880 --> 14:45.520]  praised the president's signing of this legislation just about 15 minutes before
[14:45.520 --> 14:51.760]  I was happy to come on your air let me guess Fidel Castro Fidel Castro praised
[14:51.760 --> 14:58.520]  Obamacare that's an endorsement if ever there was one well the state is God
[14:58.520 --> 15:04.960]  under the New World Order system let's get into the unconstitutionality of
[15:04.960 --> 15:10.320]  this and how you would attack it I don't think Attorney General suing or joining
[15:10.320 --> 15:14.240]  their suit is enough we need to have states nullify under the 9th and 10th
[15:14.240 --> 15:19.280]  amendment and to not just roll this back but you're not gonna take our highway
[15:19.280 --> 15:22.600]  funds you're not gonna take our education funds I mean I think this is a
[15:22.600 --> 15:27.560]  wake-up call for people to really start reversing the fact that for a hundred
[15:27.560 --> 15:32.520]  plus years the federal government has been expanding its authority into areas
[15:32.520 --> 15:35.520]  that are completely illegal
[15:35.520 --> 15:40.160]  you pray on us when we sleep
[15:40.160 --> 15:46.480]  oppression you chase after the tired before the weak
[15:46.480 --> 15:53.160]  oppression you know you mean only harm
[15:53.160 --> 15:59.160]  oppression you reach out with your heart and love
[15:59.160 --> 16:05.600]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[16:05.600 --> 16:10.160]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[16:10.160 --> 16:13.560]  they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[16:13.560 --> 16:19.160]  tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling
[16:19.160 --> 16:24.440]  the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[16:24.440 --> 16:29.000]  attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[16:29.000 --> 16:33.640]  off-shore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[16:33.640 --> 16:37.680]  constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're

[20:00.320 --> 20:07.280]  coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones broadcasting
[20:07.280 --> 20:14.320]  network network you know it's one thing Alex for a state legislature and a
[20:14.320 --> 20:18.440]  governor sign a piece of paper saying we stand on our 10th amendment and we are a
[20:18.440 --> 20:22.760]  sovereign state it would be quite another for a state legislature to enact
[20:22.760 --> 20:27.120]  legislation that did the following prohibit state employees from
[20:27.120 --> 20:33.560]  enforcing federal law indict federal officials who come into the state with
[20:33.560 --> 20:38.880]  the intention of enforcing federal law that conflicts with state law impose a
[20:38.880 --> 20:43.000]  real estate tax on federal property within the state now I know that that has
[20:43.000 --> 20:46.760]  been unlawful for the past 200 years but suffice it to say we have a different
[20:46.760 --> 20:51.440]  Supreme Court now that might look at this at this differently drag before
[20:51.440 --> 20:57.200]  county and state grand juries federal officers who insist on enforcing federal
[20:57.200 --> 21:02.240]  law that is unconstitutional within the states the states really have to stand
[21:02.240 --> 21:06.800]  up for their sovereignty they have to do more than say we are a sovereign state
[21:06.800 --> 21:11.280]  there has to be teeth to their proclamation of sovereignty now I
[21:11.280 --> 21:16.680]  would like to see the popular election of senators done away with I would like
[21:16.680 --> 21:22.440]  to see state legislatures send members of the Senate to the Senate because then
[21:22.440 --> 21:26.840]  they wouldn't be stealing power from the states or those senators would soon be
[21:26.840 --> 21:30.720]  out of their jobs the federal government didn't begin to grow to gargantuan
[21:30.720 --> 21:35.520]  proportions until the progressive era with the popular election of senators
[21:35.520 --> 21:40.680]  were able to pander to the collectivist impulses of the masses and deliver as
[21:40.680 --> 21:44.880]  big a piece of pie as they could and create the permanent underclass that
[21:44.880 --> 21:49.480]  relied on them for support and returned it with votes we've seen a
[21:49.480 --> 21:54.280]  premeditated development of this police state in their internal documents to
[21:54.280 --> 21:58.440]  suppress the American people it's the same thing worldwide and now you have
[21:58.440 --> 22:02.800]  these elites going offshore forming a global government openly saying a bank
[22:02.800 --> 22:06.680]  of the world that you will pay all your carbon taxes to talk about that in the
[22:06.680 --> 22:11.320]  next segment with judge Andrew Napolitano author best-selling author of
[22:11.320 --> 22:14.400]  multiple books his new book is out we'll tell you about the book and get into it
[22:14.400 --> 22:18.760]  before he leaves us but getting back into solutions on this Obamacare judge
[22:18.760 --> 22:24.120]  right am I right in saying that this is pretty much the make it or break it
[22:24.120 --> 22:29.600]  issue if we give into this and if we can't defeat this then the sky's the
[22:29.600 --> 22:35.000]  limit for these tyrants it is and vice president Biden admitted as much
[22:35.000 --> 22:38.360]  yesterday when he said if we had to pass this we would have been toothless and
[22:38.360 --> 22:42.440]  now that we passed this we have a lot else that we need to do first of all
[22:42.440 --> 22:47.080]  we know that the next eight months is going to be a rush to legislation because
[22:47.080 --> 22:50.800]  they know they're not stupid they know that they will never have the majorities
[22:50.800 --> 22:54.880]  in the Congress after November if there is a November election that they have
[22:54.880 --> 22:58.360]  now so they're going to try and regulate as much as they can in the next eighth
[22:58.360 --> 23:03.200]  eight months but but think about how insidious this is the Supreme Court has
[23:03.200 --> 23:09.000]  ruled countless times that the the most private conversation you have the one
[23:09.000 --> 23:14.280]  most utterly immune from governmental intrusion is with your physician more so
[23:14.280 --> 23:19.080]  than with your spouse it's with your physician this legislation purports with
[23:19.080 --> 23:25.000]  the stroke of a pen to do away with generations of that protection by putting
[23:25.000 --> 23:29.920]  a federal bureaucrat between you and your physician and permitting the
[23:29.920 --> 23:34.640]  bureaucrat to dictate to the physician what services are available to you and
[23:34.640 --> 23:39.800]  how much money is available for those services and it says they can share it
[23:39.800 --> 23:43.720]  with any federal agency they want and it says that those decisions by the
[23:43.720 --> 23:47.360]  bureaucrat are not appealable everything under the sun that the government
[23:47.360 --> 23:51.320]  does except the Supreme Court because that's the last appeal is appealable
[23:51.320 --> 23:55.400]  but this legislation says it's not appealable so they violate your right to
[23:55.400 --> 23:59.560]  privacy they violate your right to talk to your physician without the government
[23:59.560 --> 24:03.560]  there they violate your right to the privacy of your medical records they
[24:03.560 --> 24:07.920]  decide how much money is available to pay your physician for the services that
[24:07.920 --> 24:14.160]  you may need is this the government that the framers gave us or is this as you
[24:14.160 --> 24:20.640]  say Alex so nicely the breaking point is this the point beyond which they cannot
[24:20.640 --> 24:25.400]  go now that leads us to the constitutional challenges to me the
[24:25.400 --> 24:31.080]  violation of privacy and the order that all Americans shall purchase something
[24:31.080 --> 24:35.800]  whether they want it need it can afford it already have it or not purchase
[24:35.800 --> 24:41.520]  something that the government approves of are the two most obvious unconstitutional
[24:41.520 --> 24:45.720]  aspects of this there are many others it's against the Constitution for the
[24:45.720 --> 24:51.000]  Congress to tell a state legislature how it must legislate and how it must
[24:51.000 --> 24:55.920]  spend that's called commandeering the legislature that's been prohibited for
[24:55.920 --> 24:59.560]  many years but the Congress does it and gets away with it anyway but hold on
[24:59.560 --> 25:04.240]  that's another key point you just rattled off is that and we've heard the
[25:04.240 --> 25:06.920]  state legislatures and governors and attorney generals talk about this and
[25:06.920 --> 25:11.600]  it's in the bill right in some cases doubles the amount of money that states
[25:11.600 --> 25:16.000]  must levy to give to Medicare and Medicaid yes it does yes it does now
[25:16.000 --> 25:19.920]  normally when the Congress wants to control a state legislature it bribes
[25:19.920 --> 25:24.120]  it so for example did you ever wonder why speed limits are the same all around
[25:24.120 --> 25:28.160]  the country did you ever wonder why the blood alcohol content in a person's
[25:28.160 --> 25:32.080]  veins sufficient to charge them for drunk driving is the same in every state
[25:32.080 --> 25:37.040]  did all 50 states just magically adopt the same standards no the Congress
[25:37.040 --> 25:41.000]  adopted the standards was told by its lawyers these standards wouldn't fly
[25:41.000 --> 25:44.320]  because the Constitution doesn't authorize the Congress to do this so
[25:44.320 --> 25:48.240]  the Congress went to the states and said here is hundreds of millions of
[25:48.240 --> 25:52.600]  dollars to repave your highways but if you accept this money you have to
[25:52.600 --> 25:57.080]  legislate about speed limits and blood alcohol content as we want that's a
[25:57.080 --> 26:01.280]  bribe if you or I Alex or anybody listening to us now went to a state
[26:01.280 --> 26:05.320]  legislature and said here's cash now write the law the way I want it we would
[26:05.320 --> 26:10.280]  be arrested and rightly so for attempted bribery in this case with this
[26:10.280 --> 26:16.280]  health care legislation there is no bribe there is an outright command from
[26:16.280 --> 26:22.480]  the Congress to the state legislatures you shall license more physicians you
[26:22.480 --> 26:28.560]  shall spend more money when the Congress does that that's called commandeering a
[26:28.560 --> 26:34.080]  state legislature and the Supreme Court in the past 15 years has twice
[26:34.080 --> 26:38.320]  prohibited the Congress from doing that so that's another unconstitutional
[26:38.320 --> 26:42.680]  aspect of this judge you're right when you make the point this is the mad rush
[26:42.680 --> 26:46.360]  and now that they've already done something this unpopular and committed
[26:46.360 --> 26:51.320]  political suicide Harry saying hey we got to go ahead and pass the carbon tax
[26:51.320 --> 26:57.320]  we got to go ahead and pass blanket total amnesty we've got to go ahead and
[26:57.320 --> 27:01.880]  pass cybersecurity which even the Associated Press says allows Obama to
[27:01.880 --> 27:07.400]  completely shut the web off if he so chooses they want to pass the new
[27:07.400 --> 27:12.520]  enemy belligerence act that says for any intelligence value or such other
[27:12.520 --> 27:17.280]  matters as the president considers you may be secretly arrested and
[27:17.280 --> 27:22.960]  interrogated and held I mean they are and Lindsey Graham is arguing for similar
[27:22.960 --> 27:26.920]  legislation you know how how hideous that piece of legislation it is it
[27:26.920 --> 27:32.640]  actually says the only way you can get out of military confinement and even
[27:32.640 --> 27:38.040]  appear before a judge Alex is if the House and Senate intelligence committees
[27:38.040 --> 27:43.320]  vote to let you out what a perversion of our system of justice that instead of
[27:43.320 --> 27:48.200]  having judges say to the government thou shalt not violate the right of any
[27:48.200 --> 27:52.760]  person because the Constitution protects persons not just good persons and not
[27:52.760 --> 27:57.360]  just Americans but all persons they would have themselves politicians assume
[27:57.360 --> 28:02.720]  the judicial role and decide who can get away from the waterboarding and into a
[28:02.720 --> 28:08.600]  federal prison instead this is an orgy this is an orgy of power grabbing yes
[28:08.600 --> 28:13.720]  it is by the executive and yes it is the legislative and again I hear all
[28:13.720 --> 28:18.000]  these neocons on radio and TV saying oh we don't want to let al-qaeda go but the
[28:18.000 --> 28:21.840]  point is we know that all of this is written and we have the Homeland
[28:21.840 --> 28:25.720]  Security internal documents this whole thing is designed and pointed at
[28:25.720 --> 28:30.920]  returning veterans gun owners conservatives libertarians this is for
[28:30.920 --> 28:35.640]  the American people you know when Janet the head of the Department of Homeland
[28:35.640 --> 28:40.320]  Security Janet what's her name announced that the most dangerous people on the
[28:40.320 --> 28:45.600]  planet where the groups you just indicated right to lifers people believe
[28:45.600 --> 28:50.480]  in the second amendment for returning veterans from the wars people who think
[28:50.480 --> 28:54.720]  taxes are too high and the government is two owners
[28:59.320 --> 29:05.480]  one major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system

[33:06.440 --> 33:21.880]  Broadcasting Network. Let's talk about the heart and soul of the Republican
[33:21.880 --> 33:27.640]  Party the leadership predominantly are as you said just the other wing of the
[33:27.640 --> 33:34.720]  big government party they're the twins right and everywhere if George W. Bush had
[33:34.720 --> 33:39.080]  proposed Obamacare the Republicans that are screaming the loudest now would be
[33:39.080 --> 33:43.840]  supporting it that's what I think of their fidelity to the Constitution to the
[33:43.840 --> 33:49.240]  primacy of the individual and to the free market to them it's just a game of R
[33:49.240 --> 33:54.200]  versus D it has nothing to do with the natural law or human liberty I'm sorry
[33:54.200 --> 33:57.880]  for interrupting you I wanted to get that in because no no I know it's me no
[33:57.880 --> 34:01.840]  I don't want to claim to be pure here they're no more pure than the other side
[34:01.840 --> 34:05.840]  they just happen to be in the minority so it's convenient and comfortable for
[34:05.840 --> 34:11.680]  them to oppose this monstrosity well I agree with you let me then pose the
[34:11.680 --> 34:16.120]  question this way for you we've seen top Republican strategists come out against
[34:16.120 --> 34:20.960]  Rand Paul and say they've got to defeat them they're now allowing the head
[34:20.960 --> 34:27.600]  election official who's running against Rand Paul in the Republican Party to not
[34:27.600 --> 34:33.680]  recuse himself but run the election that he himself is running in correct the
[34:33.680 --> 34:36.680]  associated press up so I want to get your take on that we have all these other
[34:36.680 --> 34:41.280]  Republican strategists demonizing the Tea Parties demonizing the Berthers we
[34:41.280 --> 34:44.960]  know his names Barry Sataro we know he gave up a citizenship became an
[34:44.960 --> 34:48.560]  Indonesian regardless of what happened in Kenya and where their smoke there's
[34:48.560 --> 34:54.520]  fire we know that the main line blue blood leadership is attempting to
[34:54.520 --> 35:00.440]  demonize and shut down debate and stop the American people from using the
[35:00.440 --> 35:04.960]  Republican Party to take our country back what you what are your expert
[35:04.960 --> 35:09.240]  recommendations because those were I mean absolutely spot on earlier on what
[35:09.240 --> 35:14.120]  the state should do with Obamacare what is your recommendation for the American
[35:14.120 --> 35:18.280]  people to not just let the Republicans play the part of opposition and then
[35:18.280 --> 35:22.520]  get in power and and basically go along with all this I think the American
[35:22.520 --> 35:26.840]  people should vote out of office and and aggressively hound out of office
[35:26.840 --> 35:31.600]  lawfully obviously not only everyone who voted for Obamacare but everyone who
[35:31.600 --> 35:36.200]  voted for tarp proposed by George W. Bush everyone who voted for the first
[35:36.200 --> 35:40.400]  two stimulus is that we've had in the past four years which came from George
[35:40.400 --> 35:44.480]  W. Bush everyone who voted for the Patriot Act which came from George W. Bush
[35:44.480 --> 35:50.720]  everyone who voted for any tax increase now that would be about 93 to 94% of
[35:50.720 --> 35:55.760]  the Congress these people's voting records must be revealed the collusion
[35:55.760 --> 36:00.320]  of Rand Paul being forced to run against the guy who was in charge of counting
[36:00.320 --> 36:05.480]  the ballots even Joe Stalin wouldn't have been so bold as to do that he would
[36:05.480 --> 36:10.200]  have put a crony in to count the ballots but in Kentucky the Republicans are
[36:10.200 --> 36:14.360]  forcing Rand Paul to run against the guy who will decide who wins the the
[36:14.360 --> 36:18.080]  election the American public cannot put up with that they need to find to file
[36:18.080 --> 36:22.240]  lawsuits they need to listen to you they need to listen to what I attempt to do
[36:22.240 --> 36:26.280]  at Fox they need to educate themselves they need to know what their rights are
[36:26.280 --> 36:30.560]  and they cannot taking this take this sitting down now Alex you know I have
[36:30.560 --> 36:34.040]  been privileged to be the keynote speaker at many of these tea parties
[36:34.040 --> 36:38.000]  these folks are not going away they are not going to be co-opted by the
[36:38.000 --> 36:42.200]  Republicans they are as much a threat to the Republican leadership thank God as
[36:42.200 --> 36:45.920]  they are to the Democratic leadership because they understand that the
[36:45.920 --> 36:51.320]  Constitution was written to keep the government off the people's backs not to
[36:51.320 --> 36:56.480]  find sneaky ways for the government to do it and get away with it let's expand
[36:56.480 --> 37:01.600]  into Rand Paul Ron Paul's son I mean many polls he's ten points ahead right
[37:01.600 --> 37:05.240]  he's a shoe into win and this illustrates in the Republican leadership
[37:05.240 --> 37:10.200]  admits this this isn't just an anti-democrat incumbency this is an
[37:10.200 --> 37:15.840]  anti-incumbent period and the guy he's running against is getting all this AIG
[37:15.840 --> 37:21.120]  banker money he's a globalist and then meanwhile he's going to run the election
[37:21.120 --> 37:27.000]  and I talked to Rand Paul's people two days ago and they talked about they
[37:27.000 --> 37:32.840]  went to the Commission and they said unanimously no he can run your election
[37:32.840 --> 37:36.200]  but then we looked at past rulings in other states they've always said
[37:36.200 --> 37:40.080]  someone has to recuse themselves if they're the state's head election
[37:40.080 --> 37:47.760]  official and and are running I mean again it just shows how every form of
[37:47.760 --> 37:52.000]  common sense and checks and balances are being removed and when you have a real
[37:52.000 --> 37:56.520]  constitutionalist running for an office in come the Republican Party to try to
[37:56.520 --> 38:01.880]  destroy them they they fear someone like Rand Paul just as much as they fear his
[38:01.880 --> 38:06.800]  father Ron Paul because of their utter fidelity to the Constitution and to the
[38:06.800 --> 38:11.280]  natural law and to the belief that the individual is greater than the greater
[38:11.280 --> 38:16.600]  than the government even in my home state of New Jersey notorious for
[38:16.600 --> 38:21.760]  corruptions and political prosecutions it is against the law for the collector
[38:21.760 --> 38:26.120]  of the ballots to be on the ballot when he's collecting them it's almost
[38:26.120 --> 38:29.960]  inconceivable that this could be happening in Kentucky right underneath
[38:29.960 --> 38:35.480]  our noses and the courts won't won't interfere with it listen I'm I think that
[38:35.480 --> 38:40.400]  Rand Paul will win the primary and will win the election and will be an
[38:40.400 --> 38:44.880]  unbelievable asset in the United States Senate in spite of this I can't advise
[38:44.880 --> 38:48.120]  him as to whether or not he should file a lawsuit candidly I don't think he needs
[38:48.120 --> 38:53.400]  to do so but but there's a general principle of law that if the government's
[38:53.400 --> 38:59.120]  behavior appears to be in a conflict then the person that is creating the
[38:59.120 --> 39:03.320]  appearance of a conflict should step back this guy can run against Rand Paul
[39:03.320 --> 39:07.480]  or this guy can count the votes in the election that Rand Paul is running in
[39:07.480 --> 39:11.480]  but nobody in their right mind would say that he could do both at the same time
[39:11.480 --> 39:15.840]  and be absolutely honest that's too much of a temptation for a human being to
[39:15.840 --> 39:20.320]  have to endure and for the electorate to have to abide by well I mean you've got
[39:20.320 --> 39:24.120]  all the election officials under him that are being promised jobs in the US
[39:24.120 --> 39:28.480]  absolutely they're all political appointees Alex so he can take them to
[39:28.480 --> 39:31.960]  like it's not gonna go to the Senate but he can promise to take them to the
[39:31.960 --> 39:36.560]  Senate with him so will they look the other way when a when a group of absentee
[39:36.560 --> 39:40.880]  ballots suddenly disappears into the river or suddenly shows up in somebody's
[39:40.880 --> 39:46.640]  trunk this will force dr. Paul Rand Paul to hire more poll watchers to hire more
[39:46.640 --> 39:51.320]  people to watch the government because the government cannot be trusted to run
[39:51.320 --> 39:55.720]  an honest election because the guy running the election is running against
[39:55.720 --> 40:02.640]  Rand Paul this is just absurd well I mean if this precedent gets set this new
[40:02.640 --> 40:06.040]  corrupt precedent pretty soon the only people that can get elected anywhere
[40:06.040 --> 40:10.440]  will be the head of election suddenly that'll be the only person that can run
[40:10.440 --> 40:15.080]  and win and then they'll become kings and their kids will be the only ones that
[40:15.080 --> 40:18.840]  can win sort of like Alexander Hamilton when he wanted George Washington to be a
[40:18.840 --> 40:22.560]  king you know what I think will happen Rand Paul wins by such a large number
[40:22.560 --> 40:27.600]  that all of their sneaking and trickery will not be enough to affect the outcome
[40:27.600 --> 40:31.520]  and this collector of ballots who also wants to be on the Senate will be
[40:31.520 --> 40:36.320]  relegated to the dustbin of history where he belongs well we're already running
[40:36.320 --> 40:40.800]  out of time it's always amazing having and we got 15 minutes left here I want
[40:40.800 --> 40:45.840]  to get into the book lies the government told you but first specifically the
[40:45.840 --> 40:51.440]  Democrats and Lindsey Graham the Republicans they all know that carbon
[40:51.440 --> 40:55.920]  dioxide isn't bad they all know that China isn't going to make the cuts they
[40:55.920 --> 41:01.560]  all know that this will industrial be industrial suicide and we have all these
[41:01.560 --> 41:06.320]  big environmentalists saying they want to destroy our economy why does government
[41:06.320 --> 41:12.640]  want to destroy the economy government wants to control us because of what's
[41:12.640 --> 41:16.400]  saying Augustine called libido dominandi look we all know about certain types of
[41:16.400 --> 41:22.760]  libido this is a lust for power before the Civil War we sent people to our
[41:22.760 --> 41:27.440]  state houses and to Congress who were interested in liberty who were concerned
[41:27.440 --> 41:31.520]  with confining the government with assuring that it did not a fear would
[41:31.520 --> 41:34.480]  interfere with our natural rights with our civil liberties and with our
[41:34.480 --> 41:38.760]  property rights since the Civil War we have sent people to the government by
[41:38.760 --> 41:42.480]  and large there are exceptions both before the Civil War and afterwards but
[41:42.480 --> 41:45.520]  by and large people who are not interested in liberty but people who are
[41:45.520 --> 41:50.680]  interested in power power for its own sake power in and of itself power to
[41:50.680 --> 41:57.080]  control other people government attracts those who lust for power Ron Paul and
[41:57.080 --> 42:02.160]  Rand Paul and Ron Paul's colleagues in the house and if there are any in the
[42:02.160 --> 42:06.640]  Senate I'm unaware of them are the exception to the rule but for the most
[42:06.640 --> 42:11.600]  part this is the type of human being that the government attracts and this type
[42:11.600 --> 42:17.480]  of illicit aggregation of power gets worse and worse and worse because when
[42:17.480 --> 42:21.200]  they get power they hand it off to their successors just like Mike Chertoff
[42:21.200 --> 42:25.040]  handed it off to Janet Napolitano and I know what you're thinking the answer is
[42:25.040 --> 42:31.520]  no we are not related this happens generation after generation after
[42:31.520 --> 42:35.640]  generation that's why I am not optimistic about our future because it will
[42:35.640 --> 42:44.240]  take a generation of doctors Paul to change this to stop it to reverse it
[43:00.080 --> 43:04.400]  hello this is Alex Jones with some important questions if you're going

[47:00.520 --> 47:06.480]  coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones
[47:06.480 --> 47:10.720]  Broadcasting Network Network
[47:30.560 --> 47:35.120]  I want to encourage viewers to support this radio show to support our films we
[47:35.120 --> 47:39.000]  have two new films coming out in the middle of April order them at info
[47:39.000 --> 47:44.000]  wars dot com invisible empire a new world order defined and police state for

[47:48.760 --> 47:53.280]  super high quality but go by the DVDs make copies give everyone you know
[47:53.280 --> 47:58.000]  because one of the most effective things that we have ever done is these
[47:58.000 --> 48:02.840]  films and this unlocks people's minds it shows them the predatory nature of this
[48:02.840 --> 48:07.280]  global elite what is the nature of this world government from your research and
[48:07.280 --> 48:12.120]  then tie that in to the overarching system of why they want a global
[48:12.120 --> 48:16.560]  government so no one can run and flee and set up societies that are free
[48:16.560 --> 48:20.960]  because then that competes with the collectivist and outshines them in
[48:20.960 --> 48:24.760]  every case so speak to that and then you've got the floor in the last 11
[48:24.760 --> 48:28.640]  minutes on any issue you want to cover oh you are so kind and so generous to me
[48:28.640 --> 48:32.640]  Alex and I'm deeply grateful to be here look I'm just a simple night watch
[48:32.640 --> 48:36.920]  man that's employed by Fox my job is to watch the government in the nighttime
[48:36.920 --> 48:40.280]  when it doesn't think that people are watching it and doesn't want people to
[48:40.280 --> 48:44.880]  look at it to see what it is doing to steal our freedom and to steal our
[48:44.880 --> 48:48.600]  property the one world government has been around since the progressive era
[48:48.600 --> 48:54.240]  and you're right Alex these people are enormously patient obviously the people
[48:54.240 --> 48:58.240]  who came up with this concept are no longer with us but their successors
[48:58.240 --> 49:02.040]  are they are wealthier they are more sophisticated and they are just as
[49:02.040 --> 49:07.560]  committed as their predecessors were they simply want control they want power
[49:07.560 --> 49:13.520]  for the the the joy of exercising power in and of itself power corrupts
[49:13.520 --> 49:18.040]  absolute power corrupts absolutely they don't want to have to answer to voters
[49:18.040 --> 49:22.280]  they don't want to have to answer to a Constitution that limits their behavior
[49:22.280 --> 49:25.960]  they want to be able to take whatever property they can whether they call it
[49:25.960 --> 49:29.960]  eminent domain whatever they want to call the process by which they take it
[49:29.960 --> 49:35.840]  they want to protect us cradle to grave so that we are totally dependent upon
[49:35.840 --> 49:40.320]  them for everything so they can decide who'll be in their group and who won't
[49:40.320 --> 49:46.840]  if you read George Orwell's 1984 he was just off by a couple of years but
[49:46.840 --> 49:53.120]  almost everything that was in there was predicted and we see it now the use of
[49:53.120 --> 50:00.280]  law to assault liberty and to steal property do you remember Alex studying
[50:00.280 --> 50:05.760]  basic American history the King of England had ingenious ways to tax us
[50:05.760 --> 50:11.120]  the last straw was the Stamp Act it required that every colonist have on
[50:11.120 --> 50:16.360]  every piece of paper in his or her home a stamp every book every bank draft every
[50:16.360 --> 50:20.640]  mortgage every lease every deed every pamphlet even a poster that was going to
[50:20.640 --> 50:23.760]  be nailed to a tree had to have the King's stamp on it
[50:23.760 --> 50:27.760]  imagine having to go yet we have enough difficulties with the post office as it
[50:27.760 --> 50:31.520]  is you had to go to a foreign post office in the colonies and buy the King's
[50:31.520 --> 50:36.040]  stamp question how did the government know if you had the King's stamp on
[50:36.040 --> 50:40.280]  every piece of paper in your house answer the Parliament enacted the Townsend
[50:40.280 --> 50:45.000]  Acts which permitted British soldiers to write their own search warrants and thus
[50:45.000 --> 50:49.080]  they would show up at your home and hand you a piece of paper on which they had
[50:49.080 --> 50:53.400]  purported to authorize themselves to enter your home ostensibly to look for
[50:53.400 --> 50:57.000]  the stamps of course they would confiscate alcohol they would confiscate
[50:57.000 --> 51:00.640]  furniture which you couldn't demonstrate you I paid taxes on they would even
[51:00.640 --> 51:04.800]  sometimes kick you out of the house and take it over for days or weeks or months
[51:04.800 --> 51:10.920]  we fought a revolution we won the revolution we wrote a Constitution we
[51:10.920 --> 51:15.440]  added the fourth amendment to that Constitution which next to the right to
[51:15.440 --> 51:20.440]  life is the greatest right there is the right to be left alone and it says the
[51:20.440 --> 51:24.680]  government can't come on to your property and can't seize what you have and
[51:24.680 --> 51:29.080]  can't intrude into your privacy unless it goes to a judge and demonstrates to a
[51:29.080 --> 51:33.680]  neutral judge that is more likely than not that you are committing crime fast
[51:33.680 --> 51:38.080]  forward 200 years to the Patriot Act what does the Patriot Act do it allows
[51:38.080 --> 51:44.280]  federal agents to write their own search warrants we have elected a
[51:44.280 --> 51:51.240]  government that has done the very same thing to us which was the last straw when
[51:51.240 --> 51:58.240]  we broke away from an island 3,000 miles away that was regulating us as if we
[51:58.240 --> 52:02.520]  were chattel and as if we were slaves to them when Jefferson wrote in the
[52:02.520 --> 52:06.480]  in the declaration of independence the words that every school child knows
[52:06.480 --> 52:11.360]  Alex by heart all men are created equal and endowed by their creator with
[52:11.360 --> 52:15.960]  certain inalienable rights and that among these is life liberty and the
[52:15.960 --> 52:22.480]  pursuit of happiness he wedded the American soul to the idea of the natural
[52:22.480 --> 52:27.240]  law that our rights come from nature from our humanity that we are created in
[52:27.240 --> 52:32.160]  the image and likeness of God and as he is perfectly free he has given us the
[52:32.160 --> 52:38.560]  gift of perfect freedom in Philadelphia in 1787 when they argued all summer
[52:38.560 --> 52:42.880]  about how the government should look and what the Constitution should be they
[52:42.880 --> 52:47.040]  began with an argument about what is the source of our rights and Alexander
[52:47.040 --> 52:52.200]  Hamilton the big government guy of the day the guy who said debt was good even
[52:52.200 --> 52:57.080]  in 1787 argued that without the government there can be no rights and
[52:57.080 --> 53:02.160]  the same government that gives rights can take them away Madison repute refuted
[53:02.160 --> 53:06.440]  him toe-to-toe point-to-point and said our rights come from our humanity
[53:06.440 --> 53:12.080]  Madison one read the First Amendment it doesn't say Congress shall grant
[53:12.080 --> 53:18.640]  freedom of speech it says Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of
[53:18.640 --> 53:23.240]  speech why do I emphasize the word the because the framers recognized that
[53:23.240 --> 53:28.520]  freedom of speech pre-existed the government pre-existed the country came
[53:28.520 --> 53:33.320]  by virtue of our birth and the purpose of the First Amendment was to assure
[53:33.320 --> 53:37.400]  that Congress and ultimately the president and eventually the courts and
[53:37.400 --> 53:43.400]  one day the states could not interfere with the basic freedoms the right to
[53:43.400 --> 53:47.640]  think as you wish the right to say what you think the right to publish what you
[53:47.640 --> 53:52.080]  say the right to worship or not to worship the right to come and go as you
[53:52.080 --> 53:55.880]  see fit the right to petition the government for a redress of grievances
[53:55.880 --> 54:02.360]  the right to defend yourself Alex by any technologically advanced means that
[54:02.360 --> 54:07.520]  are available at any given time which includes the right to shoot at the
[54:07.520 --> 54:11.880]  government when it is taken over by tyrants and then of course the right
[54:11.880 --> 54:16.880]  to be left alone in the Fourth Amendment all of these rights are natural to us
[54:16.880 --> 54:21.760]  and every person in the government takes an oath to uphold the Constitution
[54:21.760 --> 54:27.680]  meaning upholding the inviolability of these rights but in my years on the
[54:27.680 --> 54:32.120]  bench and I write about this in the book every time the government was in
[54:32.120 --> 54:37.400]  front of me Alex it wasn't to enforce the Constitution it wasn't to protect
[54:37.400 --> 54:43.200]  someone's rights it was to find some sneaky or ingenious way to get around
[54:43.200 --> 54:49.960]  the Constitution but claim that they were enforcing it now my new book and
[54:49.960 --> 54:55.400]  I'm very happy to tell you that as of a few minutes ago it's number 13 on the
[54:55.400 --> 54:59.760]  New York Times bestseller bestseller list that doesn't mean the Times approves of
[54:59.760 --> 55:05.720]  the book hardly it means that the most public counter of book sales is ranking
[55:05.720 --> 55:09.160]  me number 13 which is very good because then it gets published in that list and
[55:09.160 --> 55:13.920]  a lot of folks that don't watch Fox or listen to Alex Jones or don't know me
[55:13.920 --> 55:20.680]  will be exposed to the book the book posits the following why do we expect
[55:20.680 --> 55:25.360]  that the government will lie why do we know that the government lies and do
[55:25.360 --> 55:29.840]  nothing about it would Lyndon Johnson have beaten Barry Goldwater in 64 if we
[55:29.840 --> 55:34.320]  knew that he was secretly planning to invade North Vietnam as he accused
[55:34.320 --> 55:39.320]  Goldwater of doing what FDR have been elected in 44 reelected in 44 if the
[55:39.320 --> 55:44.160]  public had known that he caused Pearl Harbor because he needed an excuse to
[55:44.160 --> 55:49.680]  enter World War two with George W. Bush have been reelected in 2004 if people
[55:49.680 --> 55:53.200]  knew that there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and that he knew it
[55:53.200 --> 55:56.920]  and ought to have known it that he was torturing people and lying about it that
[55:56.920 --> 56:00.480]  he was listening to people's phone calls and capturing their computer strokes all
[56:00.480 --> 56:06.200]  in violation of federal law that's what the book challenges Americans Alex to be
[56:06.200 --> 56:12.520]  aware of to recognize to reject and to correct my dear friend I've enjoyed all
[56:12.520 --> 56:18.720]  my time with you and in closing why do we put up with the line why have we gotten
[56:18.720 --> 56:24.200]  to a point where it's just accepted they lie but then that 20% that supports the
[56:24.200 --> 56:28.960]  government health bills still believe they're getting something free and the
[56:28.960 --> 56:33.840]  system is going for broke because they passed the point of no return they have
[56:33.840 --> 56:37.640]  committed so many crimes they're so lawless they've stolen so much they
[56:37.640 --> 56:41.360]  know the country's going bankrupt Bloomberg reports the feds are openly
[56:41.360 --> 56:45.400]  getting ready to take pension funds to fund their operations and to fund the
[56:45.400 --> 56:50.680]  banks they have decided to go all the way just like Hitler or Stalin or Mal
[56:50.680 --> 56:55.120]  and it's time for the public to wake up I mean you mentioned the Stamp Act here
[56:55.120 --> 57:04.080]  is New Jersey CBS television CBS TV WCBS cops in New Jersey town given keys to

[01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:41.740]  The tree on the ground
[01:00:41.740 --> 01:00:44.740]  The shelter from the sand
[01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:47.740]  The damnation is slowing down
[01:00:47.740 --> 01:00:54.740]  It's gaining powerful power
[01:00:54.740 --> 01:00:56.740]  A gas mask is the creature
[01:00:56.740 --> 01:00:59.740]  And the summer of rage
[01:00:59.740 --> 01:01:02.740]  The billiards graves with their staves
[01:01:02.740 --> 01:01:05.740]  You and I, they'll accident

[01:01:20.740 --> 01:01:23.740]  Chaos is slowing down
[01:01:23.740 --> 01:01:26.740]  In your mind
[01:01:26.740 --> 01:01:28.740]  Little time

[01:01:30.740 --> 01:01:33.740]  To the lowest I can be
[01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:37.740]  See the whole world rise
[01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:43.740]  Be the shield up front in the can
[01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:44.740]  I'll shoot you down

[01:02:01.740 --> 01:02:03.740]  I've lost all my information
[01:02:03.740 --> 01:02:04.740]  In a lie
[01:02:04.740 --> 01:02:07.740]  The day I was caught up
[01:02:07.740 --> 01:02:09.740]  In this big land
[01:02:09.740 --> 01:02:11.740]  They tried to silence
[01:02:11.740 --> 01:02:15.740]  With hope they tried
[01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:17.740]  Go to Pittsburgh now
[01:02:17.740 --> 01:02:19.740]  With video cameras
[01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:21.740]  Let the chill
[01:02:21.740 --> 01:02:24.740]  Your will is going on
[01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:27.740]  Chaos is slowing down
[01:02:27.740 --> 01:02:29.740]  In your mind
[01:02:29.740 --> 01:02:31.740]  Little time
[01:02:31.740 --> 01:02:34.740]  The salvation in your smile
[01:02:34.740 --> 01:02:36.740]  To the lowest I can be
[01:02:36.740 --> 01:02:41.740]  See the whole world rise
[01:02:41.740 --> 01:02:44.740]  Republic is falling right now
[01:02:50.740 --> 01:02:52.740]  World leaders arriving in Pittsburgh
[01:02:52.740 --> 01:02:56.740]  The G20 Summit are finding a city on lockdown
[01:02:56.740 --> 01:02:58.740]  The next moment, my ear drums were blasting
[01:02:58.740 --> 01:03:00.740]  And as that happened, I basically turned around
[01:03:00.740 --> 01:03:04.740]  Saw them out, pulled your eyes away, assisted by military
[01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:06.740]  They're closing in
[01:03:13.740 --> 01:03:15.740]  This was the talk of the town
[01:03:15.740 --> 01:03:16.740]  And hearted on Thursday
[01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:18.740]  Mercedes decked out in the city
[01:03:18.740 --> 01:03:20.740]  Of Heart and Police Department decal
[01:03:20.740 --> 01:03:22.740]  And driven by American police force members
[01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:24.740]  We're not disclosing the name
[01:03:24.740 --> 01:03:26.740]  Of our parent company
[01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:28.740]  We know the guy that owns the company
[01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:31.740]  But we've never seen this name before
[01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:33.740]  Excuse me, you just brought a bomb on us
[01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:36.740]  This is red dog, far and mercenary group
[01:03:36.740 --> 01:03:38.740]  And men are driving around doing police work
[01:03:38.740 --> 01:03:40.740]  With Heart and Police
[01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:42.740]  This is their American police force
[01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:44.740]  Love Codes, this is insane
[01:03:49.740 --> 01:03:51.740]  Captains describe a terror attack
[01:03:51.740 --> 01:03:53.740]  And the arrest of a suspect
[01:03:53.740 --> 01:03:55.740]  So he's the control back then
[01:03:55.740 --> 01:03:57.740]  And of course it's not a matter of
[01:03:57.740 --> 01:03:59.740]  To connect the dots
[01:03:59.740 --> 01:04:01.740]  The FBI now has five versions of their story
[01:04:01.740 --> 01:04:03.740]  That's how they were departed in the end
[01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:04.740]  And that's how it was
[01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:06.740]  And the scanning machine that we currently
[01:04:06.740 --> 01:04:07.740]  Are digging through the point
[01:04:07.740 --> 01:04:09.740]  He told me to go through the scanner
[01:04:09.740 --> 01:04:10.740]  And I said no
[01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:11.740]  It's a real act of submission
[01:04:11.740 --> 01:04:13.740]  They were involved in a cover-up

[01:05:03.740 --> 01:05:05.740]  The main event is the wholesale destruction
[01:05:05.740 --> 01:05:06.740]  Of the world economy

[01:06:18.740 --> 01:06:20.740]  Alex Jones
[01:06:25.740 --> 01:06:27.740]  We always look forward
[01:06:27.740 --> 01:06:28.740]  To our once-a-month visit
[01:06:28.740 --> 01:06:29.740]  With Congressman Ron Paul
[01:06:29.740 --> 01:06:31.740]  He's got to go in 14 minutes
[01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:33.740]  I got my atomic clock to a key vote
[01:06:33.740 --> 01:06:35.740]  Got to be in a committee room
[01:06:35.740 --> 01:06:36.740]  So he's with us now
[01:06:36.740 --> 01:06:37.740]  I'm going to move quickly
[01:06:37.740 --> 01:06:39.740]  First off, congressman
[01:06:39.740 --> 01:06:42.740]  You won the straw poll at CPAC
[01:06:42.740 --> 01:06:44.740]  Proving that most of the Republicans
[01:06:44.740 --> 01:06:46.740]  Are not warmongering neocons
[01:06:46.740 --> 01:06:48.740]  84% approval rating in Texas
[01:06:48.740 --> 01:06:50.740]  You won by a record 80% in the primary
[01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:52.740]  Showing that America
[01:06:52.740 --> 01:06:54.740]  Supports what you're doing
[01:06:54.740 --> 01:06:57.740]  Can you comment on the fact that
[01:06:57.740 --> 01:06:59.740]  Well, your take on this
[01:06:59.740 --> 01:07:01.740]  I was very pleased
[01:07:01.740 --> 01:07:02.740]  And somewhat surprised
[01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:05.740]  But it was a delight to have won that
[01:07:05.740 --> 01:07:07.740]  CPAC vote
[01:07:07.740 --> 01:07:09.740]  But you know what was interesting is
[01:07:09.740 --> 01:07:11.740]  You know, the people who oppose us
[01:07:11.740 --> 01:07:12.740]  They're still significant
[01:07:12.740 --> 01:07:14.740]  If I get 32% of the vote
[01:07:14.740 --> 01:07:16.740]  That means there's a large number
[01:07:16.740 --> 01:07:17.740]  Are still complaining
[01:07:17.740 --> 01:07:19.740]  And they're part of the establishment
[01:07:19.740 --> 01:07:21.740]  But what I thought was interesting
[01:07:21.740 --> 01:07:22.740]  Is all the sour grapes
[01:07:22.740 --> 01:07:24.740]  That was expressed afterwards
[01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:25.740]  They were complaining
[01:07:25.740 --> 01:07:26.740]  And this is not for real
[01:07:26.740 --> 01:07:28.740]  Like they did in the campaign
[01:07:28.740 --> 01:07:29.740]  But what was interesting
[01:07:29.740 --> 01:07:30.740]  Is somebody said that
[01:07:30.740 --> 01:07:32.740]  You know, what we need to do
[01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:34.740]  Is for CPAC to have any credibility
[01:07:34.740 --> 01:07:36.740]  They have to change the way they vote
[01:07:36.740 --> 01:07:38.740]  So they made the suggestion
[01:07:38.740 --> 01:07:40.740]  That nobody under 25
[01:07:40.740 --> 01:07:41.740]  Would be allowed to vote
[01:07:41.740 --> 01:07:43.740]  Which means, and you know it too
[01:07:43.740 --> 01:07:45.740]  But there are a lot of young people
[01:07:45.740 --> 01:07:47.740]  Who are interested in what we're talking about
[01:07:47.740 --> 01:07:48.740]  And I think that's fortunate
[01:07:48.740 --> 01:07:50.740]  You know, the next generation is
[01:07:50.740 --> 01:07:52.740]  Later on, but currently
[01:07:52.740 --> 01:07:53.740]  They're inheriting this mess
[01:07:53.740 --> 01:07:55.740]  So I'm delighted to talk to young people
[01:07:55.740 --> 01:07:56.740]  But this whole idea
[01:07:56.740 --> 01:07:58.740]  That the people who don't like us
[01:07:58.740 --> 01:08:00.740]  Challenging the status quo
[01:08:00.740 --> 01:08:02.740]  Well, let's not let them vote next time
[01:08:02.740 --> 01:08:04.740]  But I think that there's a lot of people
[01:08:04.740 --> 01:08:06.740]  Are coming our way every year
[01:08:06.740 --> 01:08:08.740]  And you know in the last two or three years
[01:08:08.740 --> 01:08:10.740]  That there's been tremendous growth
[01:08:10.740 --> 01:08:11.740]  In our movement
[01:08:11.740 --> 01:08:13.740]  Very encouraged
[01:08:13.740 --> 01:08:16.740]  Absolutely, I want to cut to the chase here
[01:08:16.740 --> 01:08:19.740]  Before we get into the banking situation
[01:08:19.740 --> 01:08:20.740]  A few months ago
[01:08:20.740 --> 01:08:22.740]  You were speaking at a campaign for Liberty event
[01:08:22.740 --> 01:08:24.740]  And you threw the gauntlet down
[01:08:24.740 --> 01:08:25.740]  As you did back in the 80s
[01:08:25.740 --> 01:08:26.740]  In some videos I've seen
[01:08:26.740 --> 01:08:29.740]  You said we've had a CIA coup in America
[01:08:29.740 --> 01:08:30.740]  They're bringing in the drugs
[01:08:30.740 --> 01:08:31.740]  Most people don't know
[01:08:31.740 --> 01:08:34.740]  In 96, the CIA inspector general
[01:08:34.740 --> 01:08:36.740]  Before Congress admitted that
[01:08:36.740 --> 01:08:38.740]  But it's wider than that
[01:08:38.740 --> 01:08:40.740]  We know Wall Street and the banking cartel
[01:08:40.740 --> 01:08:41.740]  The Federal Reserve system
[01:08:41.740 --> 01:08:43.740]  Through Yale and other outfits
[01:08:43.740 --> 01:08:45.740]  Set up the OSS and CIA
[01:08:45.740 --> 01:08:47.740]  And you came right out and basically said
[01:08:47.740 --> 01:08:49.740]  This is our illegitimate government
[01:08:49.740 --> 01:08:50.740]  And that ties into the banks
[01:08:50.740 --> 01:08:52.740]  Engineering the financial collapse
[01:08:52.740 --> 01:08:53.740]  Now saying they're getting ready
[01:08:53.740 --> 01:08:55.740]  For an even bigger collapse sometime this year
[01:08:55.740 --> 01:08:57.740]  In a constitution of the world
[01:08:57.740 --> 01:08:59.740]  Run by the banks
[01:08:59.740 --> 01:09:01.740]  As Gordon Brown and others called for
[01:09:01.740 --> 01:09:03.740]  Can you specifically speak
[01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:05.740]  To who runs the coup
[01:09:05.740 --> 01:09:06.740]  Who they are
[01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:07.740]  And how we remove them
[01:09:07.740 --> 01:09:09.740]  Because by openly coming out
[01:09:09.740 --> 01:09:11.740]  And really telling it like it is
[01:09:11.740 --> 01:09:13.740]  We can cut to the chase
[01:09:13.740 --> 01:09:15.740]  I have trouble naming names
[01:09:15.740 --> 01:09:17.740]  Because I don't know all the names
[01:09:17.740 --> 01:09:19.740]  But the one thing I can verify
[01:09:19.740 --> 01:09:21.740]  Is that people who should have responsibility
[01:09:21.740 --> 01:09:24.740]  For our national security intelligence
[01:09:24.740 --> 01:09:26.740]  Gathering the US Congress
[01:09:26.740 --> 01:09:29.740]  They have no idea what's going on
[01:09:29.740 --> 01:09:31.740]  We do know there's been evidence
[01:09:31.740 --> 01:09:33.740]  Brought forth that the CIA
[01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:35.740]  Actually can own banks
[01:09:35.740 --> 01:09:38.740]  And there's been fairly strong evidence
[01:09:38.740 --> 01:09:41.740]  That the CIA's been involved in drug dealing
[01:09:41.740 --> 01:09:43.740]  You know there are times when I think
[01:09:43.740 --> 01:09:44.740]  The war in Afghanistan
[01:09:44.740 --> 01:09:46.740]  We say it has to do with pipes and oil
[01:09:46.740 --> 01:09:48.740]  Gas pipeline and oil
[01:09:48.740 --> 01:09:50.740]  And other commercial things
[01:09:50.740 --> 01:09:52.740]  But the other commercial thing
[01:09:52.740 --> 01:09:54.740]  May be the drug trade
[01:09:54.740 --> 01:09:57.740]  Maybe the CIA's in competition
[01:09:57.740 --> 01:09:59.740]  With the drug dealers over there
[01:09:59.740 --> 01:10:01.740]  Because there's a lot of self-financing
[01:10:01.740 --> 01:10:03.740]  In these organizations
[01:10:03.740 --> 01:10:05.740]  But I don't take the position
[01:10:05.740 --> 01:10:07.740]  That I know all those answers
[01:10:07.740 --> 01:10:10.740]  And I don't know everything that the Fed does
[01:10:10.740 --> 01:10:12.740]  But my approach is
[01:10:12.740 --> 01:10:15.740]  That the people deserve
[01:10:15.740 --> 01:10:17.740]  And the Congress has a responsibility
[01:10:17.740 --> 01:10:19.740]  To find out what they're doing
[01:10:19.740 --> 01:10:21.740]  And if they're not doing it fine and dandy
[01:10:21.740 --> 01:10:22.740]  We'll clear the air
[01:10:22.740 --> 01:10:24.740]  But if they are doing it
[01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:26.740]  It will give us more ammunition
[01:10:26.740 --> 01:10:28.740]  For the reason why we need a different monetary system
[01:10:28.740 --> 01:10:30.740]  And we need to have a different system
[01:10:30.740 --> 01:10:31.740]  Of collecting intelligence
[01:10:31.740 --> 01:10:33.740]  Because they can tell us anything
[01:10:33.740 --> 01:10:35.740]  Remember how we went to war in Iraq
[01:10:35.740 --> 01:10:37.740]  And it was very much involved
[01:10:37.740 --> 01:10:39.740]  Up there in the CIA
[01:10:39.740 --> 01:10:42.740]  They have weapons of mass destruction
[01:10:42.740 --> 01:10:44.740]  They're about to attack us
[01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:46.740]  And it was based on false information
[01:10:46.740 --> 01:10:49.740]  And this is what disturbs me the most
[01:10:49.740 --> 01:10:52.740]  And that's why I want much, much more
[01:10:52.740 --> 01:10:55.740]  You know, transparency of what our government is doing
[01:10:55.740 --> 01:10:57.740]  Well, those were strong statements
[01:10:57.740 --> 01:10:58.740]  You made a few months ago
[01:10:58.740 --> 01:10:59.740]  And you just echoed them
[01:10:59.740 --> 01:11:01.740]  But specifically
[01:11:01.740 --> 01:11:03.740]  Congress, as you know, has had hearings
[01:11:03.740 --> 01:11:05.740]  About the shadow government
[01:11:05.740 --> 01:11:06.740]  Continuity of government
[01:11:06.740 --> 01:11:08.740]  The Homeland Security Committee in the House
[01:11:08.740 --> 01:11:12.740]  Has not been allowed to see the full text of PDD 51
[01:11:12.740 --> 01:11:14.740]  We know we've seen a 12-fold
[01:11:14.740 --> 01:11:16.740]  In the last eight-year increase in opium
[01:11:16.740 --> 01:11:18.740]  Out of Afghanistan
[01:11:18.740 --> 01:11:19.740]  We know that two years ago
[01:11:19.740 --> 01:11:21.740]  A CIA aircraft that had been used
[01:11:21.740 --> 01:11:23.740]  For torture flights crashed in Mexico
[01:11:23.740 --> 01:11:26.740]  With pure cocaine, three and a half tons
[01:11:26.740 --> 01:11:29.740]  Meaning coming directly from the source uncut
[01:11:29.740 --> 01:11:32.740]  I mean, this just comes out in Mina, Arkansas
[01:11:32.740 --> 01:11:34.740]  Over and over again
[01:11:34.740 --> 01:11:38.740]  And so when you talk about a coup over America
[01:11:38.740 --> 01:11:41.740]  How do we ever ferret this out and remove it?
[01:11:41.740 --> 01:11:43.740]  I mean, do we start, as you've been calling for,
[01:11:43.740 --> 01:11:46.740]  An audit of the private fellow reserve?
[01:11:46.740 --> 01:11:48.740]  Yeah, it won't happen until the people become
[01:11:48.740 --> 01:11:49.740]  Really outraged
[01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:51.740]  They are growing in their outrage
[01:11:51.740 --> 01:11:54.740]  But it has to translate into different ideas
[01:11:54.740 --> 01:11:56.740]  And different respect for the Constitution
[01:11:56.740 --> 01:11:58.740]  Different people up here
[01:11:58.740 --> 01:12:00.740]  And we're in the midst of this transition
[01:12:00.740 --> 01:12:03.740]  As the crisis worsens, the real challenge is
[01:12:03.740 --> 01:12:06.740]  Will we end up with a dictatorship?
[01:12:06.740 --> 01:12:08.740]  Or are we going to have people who are demanding
[01:12:08.740 --> 01:12:11.740]  A republic and open government?
[01:12:11.740 --> 01:12:14.740]  And that might take another 10, 15 years to determine
[01:12:14.740 --> 01:12:16.740]  But in the midst of a crisis, it's the worst time
[01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:18.740]  To present our views
[01:12:18.740 --> 01:12:21.740]  That's why we have to do our best
[01:12:21.740 --> 01:12:24.740]  To get as many people to agree with this as possible
[01:12:24.740 --> 01:12:26.740]  So that in the rebuilding
[01:12:26.740 --> 01:12:28.740]  We have some ideas about what the monetary system
[01:12:28.740 --> 01:12:31.740]  Should be like and what our foreign policy ought to be like
[01:12:31.740 --> 01:12:33.740]  Which means that if we had a proper foreign policy
[01:12:33.740 --> 01:12:38.740]  The incentive to have this CIA excuse
[01:12:38.740 --> 01:12:40.740]  Making excuses for knowing everything about us
[01:12:40.740 --> 01:12:42.740]  And everything that's going on in the world
[01:12:42.740 --> 01:12:44.740]  That would all change
[01:12:44.740 --> 01:12:46.740]  I don't believe that we shouldn't have some intelligence
[01:12:46.740 --> 01:12:47.740]  Gathering
[01:12:47.740 --> 01:12:50.740]  But I don't like these clandestine operations
[01:12:50.740 --> 01:12:54.740]  And killings and things that we've known to have to happen
[01:12:54.740 --> 01:12:55.740]  It's incredible
[01:12:55.740 --> 01:12:57.740]  We've only got four minutes left with Congressman Ron Paul
[01:12:57.740 --> 01:12:59.740]  We appreciate him joining us live today
[01:12:59.740 --> 01:13:01.740]  The New York Times is reporting
[01:13:01.740 --> 01:13:03.740]  They may try to revive the carbon tax
[01:13:03.740 --> 01:13:06.740]  With the direct tax on fuel
[01:13:06.740 --> 01:13:07.740]  At the refinery
[01:13:07.740 --> 01:13:11.740]  Senate trio hopes to hit paydirt with carbon fee
[01:13:11.740 --> 01:13:14.740]  At the oil company's request
[01:13:14.740 --> 01:13:17.740]  Where is the carbon tax going as well as healthcare?
[01:13:17.740 --> 01:13:20.740]  Well, it's hard for me to believe they'll do that
[01:13:20.740 --> 01:13:23.740]  Even though it's alive and they want to
[01:13:23.740 --> 01:13:26.740]  And that's their goal and they will if they can
[01:13:26.740 --> 01:13:30.740]  But under these conditions, it's so bad of an idea
[01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:33.740]  It just blows my mind to think that they'll pursue that
[01:13:33.740 --> 01:13:37.740]  So I don't know the details on whether that's going to go through or not
[01:13:37.740 --> 01:13:40.740]  But I can guarantee you there's plenty up here who still believe in it
[01:13:40.740 --> 01:13:42.740]  And will pursue it
[01:13:42.740 --> 01:13:46.740]  But I hope they come to their senses and realize how detrimental it would be
[01:13:46.740 --> 01:13:49.740]  There's a special interest we'll want to get in and try to control it
[01:13:49.740 --> 01:13:52.740]  Well, to see the establishment trying to pose as anti-establishment
[01:13:52.740 --> 01:13:53.740]  Is truly sickening
[01:13:53.740 --> 01:13:56.740]  But look at your 84% approval rating
[01:13:56.740 --> 01:13:57.740]  People know the real McCoy
[01:13:57.740 --> 01:13:59.740]  One minute left, the economy
[01:13:59.740 --> 01:14:02.740]  A lot of top economists are now agreeing with you and others
[01:14:02.740 --> 01:14:05.740]  That we may have a mega depression in the next 16 months
[01:14:05.740 --> 01:14:09.740]  And they're positioning the IMF and World Bank with a new global constitution
[01:14:09.740 --> 01:14:11.740]  Where they will pose as saviors again
[01:14:11.740 --> 01:14:16.740]  How concerned are you that this recession could get a lot worse?
[01:14:16.740 --> 01:14:18.740]  Well, I think it is going to get a lot worse
[01:14:18.740 --> 01:14:23.740]  And what is happening now is Wall Street's recovered and a few companies have recovered
[01:14:23.740 --> 01:14:28.740]  But the unemployment rate is still very high and getting worse
[01:14:28.740 --> 01:14:32.740]  And there will be plans, I'm sure they've been talking about it for quite a few years
[01:14:32.740 --> 01:14:37.740]  Because those who run the international banking system know that they're in trouble
[01:14:37.740 --> 01:14:40.740]  So they are laying plans for this
[01:14:40.740 --> 01:14:47.740]  But people do ask me about, well, do you think this will bring on the North American Union
[01:14:47.740 --> 01:14:50.740]  Or North American currency?
[01:14:50.740 --> 01:14:51.740]  And I really don't think so
[01:14:51.740 --> 01:14:54.740]  I think the bigger concern should be a worldwide currency
[01:14:54.740 --> 01:14:58.740]  And the IMF and the United Nations grab and hold and try to dictate to us
[01:14:58.740 --> 01:15:03.740]  But we have economic laws on our side because you can propose these things
[01:15:03.740 --> 01:15:08.740]  And if it does serve the special interest, if it violates, economic law won't work
[01:15:08.740 --> 01:15:10.740]  So they can't maintain a good currency
[01:15:10.740 --> 01:15:14.740]  And that's why I think the European Union is very, very fragile
[01:15:14.740 --> 01:15:17.740]  Europe at the Union as well because it's artificial
[01:15:17.740 --> 01:15:22.740]  And I think that's what would happen on a world government and a world currency
[01:15:22.740 --> 01:15:27.740]  But in the meantime, it could get pretty messy and they're going to work very hard
[01:15:27.740 --> 01:15:32.740]  To get organized, which means they'll work hard to undermine our personal liberties
[01:15:32.740 --> 01:15:34.740]  Congressman, we're going to let you go in closing
[01:15:34.740 --> 01:15:38.740]  I just want to say, no one in Congress that I've ever studied works as hard as you
[01:15:38.740 --> 01:15:41.740]  Does as much media, writes as much legislation
[01:15:41.740 --> 01:15:43.740]  You are a champion, God bless you
[01:15:43.740 --> 01:15:45.740]  Thank you very much, gotta go
[01:15:45.740 --> 01:15:47.740]  Take care, there he goes to run to his vote
[01:15:47.740 --> 01:16:15.740]  Absolutely amazing

[01:17:17.740 --> 01:17:23.740]  The United Nations would take over America, the Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world
[01:17:23.740 --> 01:17:28.740]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries
[01:17:28.740 --> 01:17:31.740]  To establish an oppressive world government
[01:17:31.740 --> 01:17:36.740]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system
[01:17:36.740 --> 01:17:39.740]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20
[01:17:39.740 --> 01:17:43.740]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else
[01:17:43.740 --> 01:17:45.740]  And I got news for you, you're everyone else

[01:20:02.740 --> 01:20:25.740]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network
[01:20:32.740 --> 01:20:41.740]  He was raised as a Muslim, both as dads, he lies about it
[01:20:41.740 --> 01:20:43.740]  His real name is Barry Sataro
[01:20:43.740 --> 01:20:47.740]  His school records are all sealed in the U.S. in college
[01:20:47.740 --> 01:20:49.740]  He clearly had CIA connections
[01:20:49.740 --> 01:20:52.740]  Barry Sataro, see that at the very top?
[01:20:52.740 --> 01:20:55.740]  Religion, Islam
[01:20:55.740 --> 01:20:59.740]  And I'll show you this document cam shot
[01:20:59.740 --> 01:21:02.740]  Meet the chubby boy with the curly hair
[01:21:02.740 --> 01:21:06.740]  New photographs of Barack Obama childhood in Indonesia emerge
[01:21:06.740 --> 01:21:09.740]  And how he was Barry Sataro
[01:21:09.740 --> 01:21:11.740]  And another issue
[01:21:11.740 --> 01:21:14.740]  I want to read from the back of Fall of the Republic
[01:21:14.740 --> 01:21:19.740]  It talks about President Obama has brazenly violated Article 1, Section 9 of the U.S. Constitution
[01:21:19.740 --> 01:21:22.740]  By seating himself at the head of the United Nations Security Council
[01:21:22.740 --> 01:21:25.740]  Thus becoming the first U.S. president to share the world body
[01:21:25.740 --> 01:21:27.740]  That is high treason
[01:21:27.740 --> 01:21:29.740]  And this to set precedence
[01:21:29.740 --> 01:21:33.740]  We've got a top lawyer on who can explain how this is being done by design
[01:21:33.740 --> 01:21:35.740]  So I guess Schwarzenegger can be president
[01:21:35.740 --> 01:21:37.740]  Next they'll tell us he was born here
[01:21:37.740 --> 01:21:41.740]  Philip J. Berg is a former Deputy Attorney General of Pennsylvania
[01:21:41.740 --> 01:21:44.740]  Former candidate for governor and U.S. Senate
[01:21:44.740 --> 01:21:46.740]  And Democratic primaries
[01:21:46.740 --> 01:21:48.740]  Former chair of the Democratic Party in Montgomery County
[01:21:48.740 --> 01:21:50.740]  Former member of the Democratic State Committee
[01:21:50.740 --> 01:21:52.740]  And attorney with offices in Montgomery County, PA
[01:21:52.740 --> 01:21:55.740]  It's an active practice in Philadelphia, PA
[01:21:55.740 --> 01:21:59.740]  He is a paid-live member of the NAACP and Voluntary Fire Police for 27 years
[01:21:59.740 --> 01:22:04.740]  Phil Berg, PhilJBerg.com, ObamaCrimes.com
[01:22:04.740 --> 01:22:08.740]  And you want to march to go to on the health care, the birth certificate, all of it
[01:22:08.740 --> 01:22:10.740]  He's got a date you need to be there
[01:22:10.740 --> 01:22:12.740]  All of you that want to have a big march, here it is
[01:22:12.740 --> 01:22:14.740]  And the alternative media cover it
[01:22:14.740 --> 01:22:16.740]  It'll be out there regardless with millions of views
[01:22:16.740 --> 01:22:18.740]  Now
[01:22:20.740 --> 01:22:22.740]  We're going to talk to Phil, who's a Democrat by the way
[01:22:22.740 --> 01:22:26.740]  About his view of this health care plan as well
[01:22:26.740 --> 01:22:28.740]  And we're going to continue with your phone calls
[01:22:28.740 --> 01:22:31.740]  But first, the issue of Obama's illegitimacy
[01:22:31.740 --> 01:22:34.740]  If we can prove, and we have proven he uses a fake name
[01:22:34.740 --> 01:22:36.740]  And that he's not a U.S. citizen
[01:22:36.740 --> 01:22:38.740]  Everything he's done is null and void
[01:22:38.740 --> 01:22:44.740]  This is a very serious issue right now, ladies and gentlemen
[01:22:44.740 --> 01:22:49.740]  We have absolutely got to get out there ahead of this
[01:22:49.740 --> 01:22:52.740]  Right now, and take our states back
[01:22:52.740 --> 01:22:55.740]  As a former deputy attorney general in your state
[01:22:55.740 --> 01:22:57.740]  As a skilled practitioner of law
[01:22:57.740 --> 01:23:00.740]  Someone who's practicing the federal and state courts
[01:23:00.740 --> 01:23:02.740]  Phil Berg, on the health care issue first
[01:23:02.740 --> 01:23:04.740]  How do you see us defeating this?
[01:23:04.740 --> 01:23:07.740]  I mean, it's discriminatory, some of the big unions are exempt
[01:23:07.740 --> 01:23:10.740]  From the Cadillac policy tax
[01:23:10.740 --> 01:23:13.740]  Some states are more exempt than others
[01:23:13.740 --> 01:23:17.740]  It forces people who don't want insurance to go pay money
[01:23:17.740 --> 01:23:22.740]  To private groups, the insurance companies wrote this, Phil Berg
[01:23:22.740 --> 01:23:24.740]  My pleasure to be on your show, Alex
[01:23:24.740 --> 01:23:28.740]  As you just said before, there's so many reasons
[01:23:28.740 --> 01:23:30.740]  To knock this bill out to overturn this bill
[01:23:30.740 --> 01:23:33.740]  I think various attorney generals in various states
[01:23:33.740 --> 01:23:36.740]  Have already filed suit, many, many more have come
[01:23:36.740 --> 01:23:38.740]  But you highlighted the significant part
[01:23:38.740 --> 01:23:41.740]  It's just unfair, they made a deal with the unions
[01:23:41.740 --> 01:23:43.740]  They made a deal with certain states
[01:23:43.740 --> 01:23:46.740]  You know, here the federal government is forcing people to buy insurance
[01:23:46.740 --> 01:23:49.740]  That's different than the federal government taxing people
[01:23:49.740 --> 01:23:52.740]  And if you don't buy insurance, they're going to penalize you
[01:23:52.740 --> 01:23:54.740]  And the penalties are going to increase
[01:23:54.740 --> 01:23:56.740]  And the penalties to the companies here
[01:23:56.740 --> 01:23:59.740]  This is just a really socialist takeover
[01:23:59.740 --> 01:24:03.740]  Every member of what you said here, anyone who voted for that bill
[01:24:03.740 --> 01:24:05.740]  People should vote against them this year
[01:24:05.740 --> 01:24:08.740]  If there's not a strong, or in some places
[01:24:08.740 --> 01:24:11.740]  If a Republican didn't file an action against them
[01:24:11.740 --> 01:24:14.740]  Because a lot of the deadlines for filing have passed
[01:24:14.740 --> 01:24:16.740]  Especially here in Pennsylvania
[01:24:16.740 --> 01:24:19.740]  And people should run as an independent in those districts
[01:24:19.740 --> 01:24:21.740]  And find out how to get on the ballot
[01:24:21.740 --> 01:24:23.740]  Because this is really outrageous
[01:24:23.740 --> 01:24:26.740]  80% of the people in the country say they did not
[01:24:26.740 --> 01:24:28.740]  Do not want health care reform
[01:24:28.740 --> 01:24:30.740]  And what do we have here? They pass it anyhow
[01:24:30.740 --> 01:24:32.740]  They don't care about us
[01:24:32.740 --> 01:24:35.740]  The kickback that some of these people must be getting
[01:24:35.740 --> 01:24:39.740]  The money under the table, the promises by Obama and other people
[01:24:39.740 --> 01:24:42.740]  So many people must be making
[01:24:42.740 --> 01:24:44.740]  And have to be making a fortune to push this forward
[01:24:44.740 --> 01:24:46.740]  But the other thing is, they're starting to
[01:24:46.740 --> 01:24:48.740]  They do some benefit this year
[01:24:48.740 --> 01:24:51.740]  But the taxation has started this year
[01:24:51.740 --> 01:24:53.740]  And other benefits, supposed benefits
[01:24:53.740 --> 01:24:55.740]  Don't kick into 2014
[01:24:55.740 --> 01:24:57.740]  That means they're going to have to
[01:24:57.740 --> 01:25:00.740]  Tax for 10 years to pay benefits for 6 years
[01:25:00.740 --> 01:25:02.740]  I mean, this is just totally outrageous
[01:25:02.740 --> 01:25:04.740]  And we have to do everything we can
[01:25:04.740 --> 01:25:07.740]  Right now, I know Gary Krept
[01:25:07.740 --> 01:25:09.740]  He's going to file a lawsuit
[01:25:09.740 --> 01:25:12.740]  Attorney General, they're filing a lawsuit
[01:25:12.740 --> 01:25:15.740]  And also, history goes back
[01:25:15.740 --> 01:25:17.740]  That if enough pressure goes on
[01:25:17.740 --> 01:25:20.740]  I mean, it looks doubtful, but Congress could repeal the act
[01:25:20.740 --> 01:25:22.740]  But the best way to get them to repeal is really
[01:25:22.740 --> 01:25:24.740]  And I'm a lifelong Democrat, as he said
[01:25:24.740 --> 01:25:26.740]  They have to vote out all these people
[01:25:26.740 --> 01:25:28.740]  Even the people on a safe seat
[01:25:28.740 --> 01:25:32.740]  I don't think any Democrat safe seat is safe right now
[01:25:32.740 --> 01:25:34.740]  When 80% of people in this country don't want it
[01:25:34.740 --> 01:25:36.740]  Well, Philburg, you said it, though
[01:25:36.740 --> 01:25:38.740]  I've been saying 70-plus percent
[01:25:38.740 --> 01:25:41.740]  And many polls now show 80% are more
[01:25:41.740 --> 01:25:43.740]  When people actually read the bill
[01:25:43.740 --> 01:25:46.740]  It says the IRS will decide
[01:25:46.740 --> 01:25:48.740]  And will be looking at your medical records
[01:25:48.740 --> 01:25:50.740]  And your bills, everything goes to them now
[01:25:50.740 --> 01:25:52.740]  And they're going to share it with other agencies
[01:25:52.740 --> 01:25:54.740]  That if you get treatments that they say
[01:25:54.740 --> 01:25:56.740]  Shouldn't be covered, even if you own your own insurance
[01:25:56.740 --> 01:25:59.740]  They're going to put extra taxes on you
[01:25:59.740 --> 01:26:01.740]  I mean, this gets involved in commerce
[01:26:01.740 --> 01:26:03.740]  This gets involved in free choice
[01:26:03.740 --> 01:26:07.740]  This makes private individuals buy a plan
[01:26:07.740 --> 01:26:08.740]  From a private group
[01:26:08.740 --> 01:26:12.740]  We know the insurance companies really wrote this bill
[01:26:12.740 --> 01:26:13.740]  And their stocks weigh up
[01:26:13.740 --> 01:26:17.740]  What about lawsuits against the insurance companies
[01:26:17.740 --> 01:26:21.740]  For going in and lobbying to make the government
[01:26:21.740 --> 01:26:23.740]  Make you pay them money?
[01:26:23.740 --> 01:26:25.740]  Perhaps, and the other thing is
[01:26:25.740 --> 01:26:26.740]  When you mentioned IRS
[01:26:26.740 --> 01:26:27.740]  I think I saw in the bill there
[01:26:27.740 --> 01:26:31.740]  That there were going to hire 16,000 new IRS agents
[01:26:31.740 --> 01:26:32.740]  Now it's 20
[01:26:32.740 --> 01:26:33.740]  Oh, it's 20,000
[01:26:33.740 --> 01:26:35.740]  To look at you and look at me
[01:26:35.740 --> 01:26:37.740]  I mean, it's outrageous
[01:26:37.740 --> 01:26:38.740]  IRS should not be involved in this
[01:26:38.740 --> 01:26:40.740]  I mean, there's so many factors here
[01:26:40.740 --> 01:26:43.740]  And everyone has to pay attention the next couple of days
[01:26:43.740 --> 01:26:45.740]  Because there's so many different things
[01:26:45.740 --> 01:26:48.740]  In this 2,000-page document that no one's even read
[01:26:48.740 --> 01:26:50.740]  And it's outrageous
[01:26:50.740 --> 01:26:51.740]  I think we have to do everything
[01:26:51.740 --> 01:26:54.740]  And I think the people that you have empowered up to now
[01:26:54.740 --> 01:26:56.740]  Have to be empowered more to stand up
[01:26:56.740 --> 01:26:58.740]  And not let any of these
[01:26:58.740 --> 01:27:00.740]  There should be when the break comes up now
[01:27:00.740 --> 01:27:02.740]  For Easter and Passover and these congresspeople
[01:27:02.740 --> 01:27:03.740]  Go back home
[01:27:03.740 --> 01:27:05.740]  If they're holding down laws
[01:27:05.740 --> 01:27:07.740]  People should really go after these things
[01:27:07.740 --> 01:27:09.740]  And tell them how upset they are
[01:27:09.740 --> 01:27:11.740]  Some of the people, like, I'm right outside of Philadelphia
[01:27:11.740 --> 01:27:13.740]  And the distance here are considered
[01:27:13.740 --> 01:27:15.740]  Very safe Democratic seats
[01:27:15.740 --> 01:27:18.740]  Because they're, like, probably 80%, 90% Democratic seats
[01:27:18.740 --> 01:27:20.740]  Yeah, so is Kennedy's seat
[01:27:20.740 --> 01:27:22.740]  So is Kennedy's seat in Massachusetts
[01:27:22.740 --> 01:27:23.740]  And that's the issue
[01:27:23.740 --> 01:27:25.740]  A lot of Democrats are mad about this
[01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:26.740]  Oh, right, right
[01:27:26.740 --> 01:27:28.740]  People really are when you get down the rank and file
[01:27:28.740 --> 01:27:30.740]  Down to the people here
[01:27:30.740 --> 01:27:32.740]  So I think you have to keep your message out there
[01:27:32.740 --> 01:27:34.740]  I'm going to put my message out there
[01:27:34.740 --> 01:27:36.740]  You mentioned, and I don't have a firm date
[01:27:36.740 --> 01:27:37.740]  As soon as I do, any day now
[01:27:37.740 --> 01:27:39.740]  We're planning a birth certificate
[01:27:39.740 --> 01:27:41.740]  Eligibility march on Washington
[01:27:41.740 --> 01:27:44.740]  And on that we can tackle on this healthcare thing
[01:27:44.740 --> 01:27:46.740]  I think this could turn out to be the biggest march
[01:27:46.740 --> 01:27:48.740]  In the history of Washington, D.C.
[01:27:48.740 --> 01:27:50.740]  And if the people come out
[01:27:50.740 --> 01:27:52.740]  And the national media, we can force them
[01:27:52.740 --> 01:27:54.740]  Once you get so many people
[01:27:54.740 --> 01:27:55.740]  They're going to have to cover this
[01:27:55.740 --> 01:27:56.740]  And we're going to insist on it
[01:27:56.740 --> 01:27:59.740]  We're asking people to bring a copy of the birth certificate
[01:27:59.740 --> 01:28:01.740]  Note my words out there, people
[01:28:01.740 --> 01:28:03.740]  Obama is a phony
[01:28:03.740 --> 01:28:05.740]  Obama is a fraud
[01:28:05.740 --> 01:28:06.740]  Obama is a usurper
[01:28:06.740 --> 01:28:08.740]  As Alex will go into and show the pictures
[01:28:08.740 --> 01:28:11.740]  The issue is really not even where he was born
[01:28:11.740 --> 01:28:14.740]  I really do believe 1,000% he was born in Kenya
[01:28:14.740 --> 01:28:16.740]  Therefore he's not natural born
[01:28:16.740 --> 01:28:19.740]  But more significant is the adoption
[01:28:19.740 --> 01:28:21.740]  He's adopted in Indonesia
[01:28:21.740 --> 01:28:24.740]  Once he's adopted, people stop and think for a minute
[01:28:24.740 --> 01:28:26.740]  You know people in your neighborhood
[01:28:26.740 --> 01:28:28.740]  Or relatives that are adopted
[01:28:28.740 --> 01:28:30.740]  And I had a discussion with an immigration
[01:28:30.740 --> 01:28:32.740]  You have to give your citizenship up
[01:28:32.740 --> 01:28:34.740]  If you adopt a Korean baby
[01:28:34.740 --> 01:28:37.740]  They give up the Korean citizenship and become American
[01:28:37.740 --> 01:28:39.740]  If Koreans adopt an American
[01:28:39.740 --> 01:28:41.740]  You give up your American, you become a Korean
[01:28:41.740 --> 01:28:44.740]  We know he was adopted as an Islamist
[01:28:44.740 --> 01:28:46.740]  In Indonesia
[01:28:46.740 --> 01:28:48.740]  Into the story
[01:28:48.740 --> 01:28:50.740]  His name is Barry Sataro
[01:28:50.740 --> 01:28:52.740]  He is a fraud
[01:28:52.740 --> 01:28:54.740]  When you're out on the road
[01:28:54.740 --> 01:28:56.740]  The last place you want to be
[01:28:56.740 --> 01:28:58.740]  Is on the road
[01:28:58.740 --> 01:29:00.740]  But if the unfortunate happens
[01:29:00.740 --> 01:29:02.740]  You'll be glad you were wearing
[01:29:02.740 --> 01:29:04.740]  Diamond Gussets
[01:29:04.740 --> 01:29:07.740]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[01:29:08.740 --> 01:29:11.740]  Where they make blue diamond gusset jeans
[01:29:13.740 --> 01:29:16.740]  They so pride in every stitch
[01:29:16.740 --> 01:29:19.740]  Guarantee you love the way they fit
[01:29:20.740 --> 01:29:23.740]  And put a diamond gusset in the crotch
[01:29:23.740 --> 01:29:25.740]  Where you need it most
[01:29:25.740 --> 01:29:29.740]  Blue diamond gussets got it
[01:29:29.740 --> 01:29:30.740]  Others don't
[01:29:30.740 --> 01:29:32.740]  We turned jeans inside out
[01:29:32.740 --> 01:29:34.740]  Diamond gusset jeans
[01:29:34.740 --> 01:29:37.740]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality
[01:29:37.740 --> 01:29:39.740]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine
[01:29:39.740 --> 01:29:41.740]  Gusset with diamond gusset jeans
[01:29:41.740 --> 01:29:44.740]  And they make blue diamond gusset jeans
[01:29:44.740 --> 01:29:46.740]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine
[01:29:46.740 --> 01:29:48.740]  Gusset Comfort with Kevlar Protection
[01:29:48.740 --> 01:29:50.740]  So you can ride all day with confidence
[01:29:50.740 --> 01:29:53.740]  Order yours at gusset.com
[01:29:53.740 --> 01:29:55.740]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it
[01:29:55.740 --> 01:29:57.740]  Others don't
[01:29:59.740 --> 01:30:01.740]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny
[01:30:01.740 --> 01:30:03.740]  In the last century alone
[01:30:03.740 --> 01:30:06.740]  This is our last chance to not relive history
[01:30:06.740 --> 01:30:08.740]  As we're finishing off this agenda
[01:30:08.740 --> 01:30:10.740]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath
[01:30:10.740 --> 01:30:12.740]  Americans at home
[01:30:12.740 --> 01:30:14.740]  And then it's influenced on our president
[01:30:14.740 --> 01:30:15.740]  And Congress
[01:30:15.740 --> 01:30:17.740]  And they really are calling the shots
[01:30:17.740 --> 01:30:20.740]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:30:20.740 --> 01:30:22.740]  As American citizens to pay attention
[01:30:22.740 --> 01:30:24.740]  For the Republic identifies
[01:30:24.740 --> 01:30:26.740]  The enemies of our nation
[01:30:26.740 --> 01:30:28.740]  The criminal offshore cartel
[01:30:28.740 --> 01:30:30.740]  Hell bent on destroying sovereignty
[01:30:30.740 --> 01:30:32.740]  And on its ashes constructing world government
[01:30:32.740 --> 01:30:35.740]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists
[01:30:35.740 --> 01:30:36.740]  They're asking for more matches
[01:30:36.740 --> 01:30:37.740]  And the Congress is saying
[01:30:37.740 --> 01:30:39.740]  Who do we make the checkout to?
[01:30:39.740 --> 01:30:41.740]  Today seems like nobody does care
[01:30:41.740 --> 01:30:43.740]  And right now in Washington DC
[01:30:43.740 --> 01:30:46.740]  We have seen a fall of the Republic
[01:30:46.740 --> 01:30:48.740]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic

[01:31:01.740 --> 01:31:03.740]  And I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator
[01:31:03.740 --> 01:31:06.740]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver
[01:31:06.740 --> 01:31:09.740]  And deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream
[01:31:09.740 --> 01:31:12.740]  By breathing the solution through the lungs
[01:31:12.740 --> 01:31:14.740]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense
[01:31:14.740 --> 01:31:17.740]  For airborne pathogens and viruses
[01:31:17.740 --> 01:31:20.740]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system
[01:31:20.740 --> 01:31:23.740]  With your self-produced nano-silver solutions
[01:31:23.740 --> 01:31:26.740]  And also delivers the silver nanoparticles
[01:31:26.740 --> 01:31:28.740]  Instantly into the bloodstream
[01:31:28.740 --> 01:31:30.740]  With continued legislation threatening the sale
[01:31:30.740 --> 01:31:32.740]  Of nano-silver products
[01:31:32.740 --> 01:31:35.740]  You can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver
[01:31:35.740 --> 01:31:37.740]  With the Silver Lungs Generator

[01:31:57.740 --> 01:31:59.740]  Hi this is Alex Jones
[01:31:59.740 --> 01:32:01.740]  Did you know that the global elite
[01:32:01.740 --> 01:32:03.740]  Are now storing non-hybrid seeds
[01:32:03.740 --> 01:32:05.740]  In secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle
[01:32:05.740 --> 01:32:07.740]  So that in a real meltdown
[01:32:07.740 --> 01:32:09.740]  Non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable
[01:32:09.740 --> 01:32:11.740]  Than silver or gold
[01:32:11.740 --> 01:32:13.740]  It's true seeds have all performed
[01:32:13.740 --> 01:32:15.740]  Even gold and silver before in this country
[01:32:15.740 --> 01:32:17.740]  And it's possible that could even happen again
[01:32:17.740 --> 01:32:19.740]  So our friends at Solutions from Science
[01:32:19.740 --> 01:32:21.740]  Have put together the perfect mix
[01:32:21.740 --> 01:32:23.740]  Of non-hybrid seeds
[01:32:23.740 --> 01:32:25.740]  They call it a survival seed bank
[01:32:25.740 --> 01:32:27.740]  And it can produce an endless supply
[01:32:27.740 --> 01:32:29.740]  Of nutrient-dense food for you and your family
[01:32:29.740 --> 01:32:31.740]  And here's the best part
[01:32:31.740 --> 01:32:33.740]  These seeds have not been genetically modified
[01:32:33.740 --> 01:32:35.740]  To plant a full acre crisis garden
[01:32:35.740 --> 01:32:38.740]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com
[01:32:38.740 --> 01:32:40.740]  That's survivalseedbank.com
[01:32:40.740 --> 01:32:45.740]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365
[01:32:45.740 --> 01:32:49.740]  That's 877-327-0365
[01:32:49.740 --> 01:32:51.740]  Remember, in a real crisis
[01:32:51.740 --> 01:32:54.740]  Non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item
[01:32:54.740 --> 01:32:57.740]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com
[01:32:59.740 --> 01:33:02.740]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin
[01:33:02.740 --> 01:33:04.740]  You're listening to the
[01:33:04.740 --> 01:33:06.740]  Alex Jones Broadcasting Network
[01:33:06.740 --> 01:33:07.740]  Network
[01:33:26.740 --> 01:33:29.740]  Bill Burr, how dare the Republican Party leadership
[01:33:29.740 --> 01:33:31.740]  Try to protect Barry Sitara
[01:33:31.740 --> 01:33:33.740]  Well, the problem is
[01:33:33.740 --> 01:33:35.740]  And I think you said it basically
[01:33:35.740 --> 01:33:38.740]  The problem is, many people in Washington
[01:33:38.740 --> 01:33:40.740]  Both parties, the higher they become
[01:33:40.740 --> 01:33:42.740]  They're in bed together
[01:33:42.740 --> 01:33:44.740]  And they really could care less about us
[01:33:44.740 --> 01:33:46.740]  Even though the Republicans didn't support
[01:33:46.740 --> 01:33:48.740]  This healthcare thing
[01:33:48.740 --> 01:33:50.740]  The pressure could have been on out here
[01:33:50.740 --> 01:33:52.740]  More so than they did
[01:33:52.740 --> 01:33:54.740]  They held it off as much as they could
[01:33:54.740 --> 01:33:56.740]  But the pressure should now be on the Republicans
[01:33:56.740 --> 01:33:58.740]  To get more Republicans elected this year
[01:33:58.740 --> 01:34:00.740]  So they can repeal this act
[01:34:00.740 --> 01:34:02.740]  This is not a good act
[01:34:02.740 --> 01:34:04.740]  We do need medical reform in this country
[01:34:04.740 --> 01:34:06.740]  But not the way they just shoved it down our throats
[01:34:06.740 --> 01:34:08.740]  And with that, the taxation on individuals
[01:34:08.740 --> 01:34:10.740]  The taxation on businesses
[01:34:10.740 --> 01:34:12.740]  If they don't take out healthcare
[01:34:12.740 --> 01:34:14.740]  The IRS looking over the shoulder
[01:34:14.740 --> 01:34:16.740]  I understand there's a provision there
[01:34:16.740 --> 01:34:18.740]  That if you don't pay the bill or something like that
[01:34:18.740 --> 01:34:20.740]  They'll attach your bank account
[01:34:20.740 --> 01:34:22.740]  We have to stop it
[01:34:22.740 --> 01:34:24.740]  Imagine all the IRS's
[01:34:24.740 --> 01:34:26.740]  Unconstitutional abuses
[01:34:26.740 --> 01:34:28.740]  And now they're going to every month
[01:34:28.740 --> 01:34:30.740]  Be looking at your paycheck records
[01:34:30.740 --> 01:34:32.740]  And the healthcare you've gotten
[01:34:32.740 --> 01:34:34.740]  And fine you if you get healthcare
[01:34:34.740 --> 01:34:36.740]  They don't agree with
[01:34:36.740 --> 01:34:38.740]  Okay, Phil Berg, you've got this big march
[01:34:38.740 --> 01:34:40.740]  Coming up, we'll have you on as soon as you announce the date
[01:34:40.740 --> 01:34:42.740]  Everybody needs to go to this
[01:34:42.740 --> 01:34:44.740]  It's not going to solve everything
[01:34:44.740 --> 01:34:46.740]  But it'll be another big step towards doing that
[01:34:46.740 --> 01:34:48.740]  Reading the mail
[01:34:48.740 --> 01:34:50.740]  Newspaper with him
[01:34:50.740 --> 01:34:52.740]  Says his teachers, his name was Barry Sitaro
[01:34:52.740 --> 01:34:54.740]  He admits his name was Barry Sitaro
[01:34:54.740 --> 01:34:56.740]  He was adopted
[01:34:56.740 --> 01:34:58.740]  We know
[01:34:58.740 --> 01:35:00.740]  He was obviously not born here
[01:35:00.740 --> 01:35:02.740]  He was born in Kenya
[01:35:02.740 --> 01:35:04.740]  But regardless, we've got him
[01:35:04.740 --> 01:35:06.740]  On the citizenship issue
[01:35:06.740 --> 01:35:08.740]  Because he shouldn't be able to be a US citizen
[01:35:08.740 --> 01:35:10.740]  Because he's an Indonesian citizen
[01:35:10.740 --> 01:35:12.740]  But all of that is sealed
[01:35:12.740 --> 01:35:14.740]  Where do we go from there?
[01:35:14.740 --> 01:35:16.740]  Well, first off, what you say is absolutely true
[01:35:16.740 --> 01:35:18.740]  And then some people come up and say
[01:35:18.740 --> 01:35:20.740]  Well, dual citizenship
[01:35:20.740 --> 01:35:22.740]  For dual citizenship to exist
[01:35:22.740 --> 01:35:24.740]  But it wouldn't give him the right to be president
[01:35:24.740 --> 01:35:26.740]  To have that
[01:35:26.740 --> 01:35:28.740]  That has not occurred
[01:35:28.740 --> 01:35:30.740]  Indonesia now has dual citizenship
[01:35:30.740 --> 01:35:32.740]  As of the year 2005
[01:35:32.740 --> 01:35:34.740]  And it's not retroactive
[01:35:34.740 --> 01:35:36.740]  So back when he was born in 1961
[01:35:36.740 --> 01:35:38.740]  Or when he was adopted around 1964-65
[01:35:38.740 --> 01:35:40.740]  There was no dual citizenship
[01:35:40.740 --> 01:35:42.740]  He is adopted
[01:35:42.740 --> 01:35:44.740]  There's school records
[01:35:44.740 --> 01:35:46.740]  We AP filmed them
[01:35:46.740 --> 01:35:48.740]  A TV show filmed them
[01:35:48.740 --> 01:35:50.740]  There are actually true records
[01:35:50.740 --> 01:35:52.740]  And that's why when he went to Occidental
[01:35:52.740 --> 01:35:54.740]  His real name is Barry Saturo
[01:35:54.740 --> 01:35:56.740]  So every time he uses the name
[01:35:56.740 --> 01:35:58.740]  Barack Hussein Obama, that's a fraud
[01:35:58.740 --> 01:36:00.740]  He committed fraud in 50 states
[01:36:00.740 --> 01:36:02.740]  To run for president
[01:36:02.740 --> 01:36:04.740]  Every time he got sworn in, Barack Hussein Obama
[01:36:04.740 --> 01:36:06.740]  What do you think of the movement of everybody calling him
[01:36:06.740 --> 01:36:08.740]  Barry Saturo now?
[01:36:08.740 --> 01:36:10.740]  That's what we should do
[01:36:10.740 --> 01:36:12.740]  We should actually call him Barry Saturo
[01:36:12.740 --> 01:36:14.740]  And they can't stop us
[01:36:14.740 --> 01:36:16.740]  That could bring him down
[01:36:16.740 --> 01:36:18.740]  If just everybody starts calling him Barry Saturo
[01:36:18.740 --> 01:36:20.740]  The Indonesian citizen known as
[01:36:20.740 --> 01:36:22.740]  Barack Obama
[01:36:22.740 --> 01:36:24.740]  Right, because if you legal
[01:36:24.740 --> 01:36:26.740]  If you have an adopted name
[01:36:26.740 --> 01:36:28.740]  That's your real name
[01:36:28.740 --> 01:36:30.740]  That's your legal name
[01:36:30.740 --> 01:36:32.740]  But we can't see any of his records
[01:36:32.740 --> 01:36:34.740]  All of his records are sealed
[01:36:34.740 --> 01:36:36.740]  Again, why would you spend over
[01:36:36.740 --> 01:36:38.740]  $1.6 million fighting all the lawsuits
[01:36:38.740 --> 01:36:40.740]  If you had nothing to hide
[01:36:40.740 --> 01:36:42.740]  He is not a natural born citizen
[01:36:42.740 --> 01:36:44.740]  The strongest case I have
[01:36:44.740 --> 01:36:46.740]  Alex is pending in the
[01:36:46.740 --> 01:36:48.740]  Court of Appeals with District of Columbia
[01:36:48.740 --> 01:36:50.740]  Where I have sued Obama
[01:36:50.740 --> 01:36:52.740]  Stating that he's not natural born
[01:36:52.740 --> 01:36:54.740]  He's not naturalized, but he's an illegal alien
[01:36:54.740 --> 01:36:56.740]  And therefore the salary
[01:36:56.740 --> 01:36:58.740]  That he received as the U.S. Senator
[01:36:58.740 --> 01:37:00.740]  Were fraudulent, and therefore that money
[01:37:00.740 --> 01:37:02.740]  About a million dollars should go back to U.S. Treasury
[01:37:02.740 --> 01:37:04.740]  I'm hoping the courts can do something with that
[01:37:04.740 --> 01:37:06.740]  But I doubt it, there's so much pressure
[01:37:06.740 --> 01:37:08.740]  On the courts coming from Obama
[01:37:08.740 --> 01:37:10.740]  And Obama's people
[01:37:10.740 --> 01:37:12.740]  From Barry Saturo
[01:37:12.740 --> 01:37:14.740]  We can do something
[01:37:14.740 --> 01:37:16.740]  We the people can do something
[01:37:16.740 --> 01:37:18.740]  And we can mobilize and do things peacefully
[01:37:18.740 --> 01:37:20.740]  We're going to start putting stuff up
[01:37:20.740 --> 01:37:22.740]  On our website about flyers
[01:37:22.740 --> 01:37:24.740]  They can download for the March
[01:37:24.740 --> 01:37:26.740]  As soon as I get to March date, I'll call you back on that
[01:37:26.740 --> 01:37:28.740]  But we have to start doing stuff
[01:37:28.740 --> 01:37:30.740]  We can even get people, we'll have it up on our website soon
[01:37:30.740 --> 01:37:32.740]  To have signs out there
[01:37:32.740 --> 01:37:34.740]  Five people can stand over at a bridge
[01:37:34.740 --> 01:37:36.740]  On a major roadway
[01:37:36.740 --> 01:37:38.740]  During rush hour
[01:37:38.740 --> 01:37:40.740]  And you can affect between 5
[01:37:40.740 --> 01:37:42.740]  And 25,000 people
[01:37:42.740 --> 01:37:44.740]  So we can mobilize
[01:37:44.740 --> 01:37:46.740]  This issue I think
[01:37:46.740 --> 01:37:48.740]  This healthcare thing
[01:37:48.740 --> 01:37:50.740]  Is probably the greatest thing to help us
[01:37:50.740 --> 01:37:52.740]  Put Obama, I'm sorry
[01:37:52.740 --> 01:37:54.740]  To put Barry Saturo in his place
[01:37:54.740 --> 01:37:56.740]  Barry Saturo
[01:37:56.740 --> 01:37:58.740]  Michelle Obama
[01:37:58.740 --> 01:38:00.740]  Michelle Saturo
[01:38:00.740 --> 01:38:02.740]  Howard Dean
[01:38:02.740 --> 01:38:04.740]  Other officials at the Democratic National Convention
[01:38:04.740 --> 01:38:06.740]  At the committee
[01:38:06.740 --> 01:38:08.740]  Senior campaign people
[01:38:08.740 --> 01:38:10.740]  And senior administration people
[01:38:10.740 --> 01:38:12.740]  They should all be
[01:38:12.740 --> 01:38:14.740]  Subjected to the criminal justice system
[01:38:14.740 --> 01:38:16.740]  And tried, and those that are
[01:38:16.740 --> 01:38:18.740]  Convicted should go to jail
[01:38:18.740 --> 01:38:20.740]  And with this any day now
[01:38:20.740 --> 01:38:22.740]  Alex and you'll get it, we're issuing
[01:38:22.740 --> 01:38:24.740]  A press release calling for
[01:38:24.740 --> 01:38:26.740]  The deep throat
[01:38:26.740 --> 01:38:28.740]  Of Barry Saturo
[01:38:28.740 --> 01:38:30.740]  Someone out there is going to want to save their can
[01:38:30.740 --> 01:38:32.740]  And they will give us the information
[01:38:32.740 --> 01:38:34.740]  The final information we need
[01:38:34.740 --> 01:38:36.740]  Remember on the situation with
[01:38:36.740 --> 01:38:38.740]  Watergate, Nixon didn't go down
[01:38:38.740 --> 01:38:40.740]  Because of the break-in
[01:38:40.740 --> 01:38:42.740]  And they went down because
[01:38:42.740 --> 01:38:44.740]  Of the cover-up
[01:38:44.740 --> 01:38:46.740]  We now have Obama in office for 15 months
[01:38:46.740 --> 01:38:48.740]  And we have a massive cover-up
[01:38:48.740 --> 01:38:50.740]  So we can get to him peacefully
[01:38:50.740 --> 01:38:52.740]  And I think we can do it with
[01:38:52.740 --> 01:38:54.740]  You know, thank God there's people like you out there
[01:38:54.740 --> 01:38:56.740]  That will talk about the truth out here
[01:38:56.740 --> 01:38:58.740]  And I thought- And it came out last year
[01:38:58.740 --> 01:39:00.740]  That Barry Saturo
[01:39:00.740 --> 01:39:02.740]  Masquerading as Barack H. Obama
[01:39:02.740 --> 01:39:04.740]  Barack Hussein Obama
[01:39:04.740 --> 01:39:06.740]  That he's got a full team with an enemy's list
[01:39:06.740 --> 01:39:08.740]  Going after the birthers
[01:39:08.740 --> 01:39:10.740]  And they've got the Republican Party leadership against us
[01:39:10.740 --> 01:39:12.740]  That means there's-
[01:39:12.740 --> 01:39:14.740]  Where there's smoke, there's fire
[01:39:14.740 --> 01:39:16.740]  Talking to Phil Berg, Attorney Phil Berg
[01:39:16.740 --> 01:39:18.740]  Former Deputy Attorney General of Pennsylvania
[01:39:18.740 --> 01:39:20.740]  A guy of real conscience
[01:39:20.740 --> 01:39:22.740]  Who stood up on so many important issues
[01:39:22.740 --> 01:39:24.740]  I guess in the final equation
[01:39:24.740 --> 01:39:26.740]  It is good news that people are finally
[01:39:26.740 --> 01:39:28.740]  Really starting to read the bills
[01:39:28.740 --> 01:39:30.740]  And they're finding out just how criminal this group is
[01:39:30.740 --> 01:39:32.740]  But take the carbon taxes
[01:39:32.740 --> 01:39:34.740]  They say they're going to try to pass that
[01:39:34.740 --> 01:39:36.740]  Were Barry Saturo and Michelle Saturo
[01:39:36.740 --> 01:39:38.740]  And their controllers
[01:39:38.740 --> 01:39:40.740]  Can shut down any factories they want
[01:39:40.740 --> 01:39:42.740]  Or any businesses
[01:39:42.740 --> 01:39:44.740]  You take over of the car industries
[01:39:44.740 --> 01:39:46.740]  If you were a big Democratic donor
[01:39:46.740 --> 01:39:48.740]  You got to keep your car dealership
[01:39:48.740 --> 01:39:50.740]  If you weren't, this came out in Congress
[01:39:50.740 --> 01:39:52.740]  They would take your dealership away
[01:39:52.740 --> 01:39:54.740]  I mean, you've studied Barack Obama
[01:39:54.740 --> 01:39:58.740]  Am I right in saying he is a complete mafia thug?
[01:39:58.740 --> 01:40:00.740]  He's-
[01:40:00.740 --> 01:40:02.740]  Just wait for a minute
[01:40:02.740 --> 01:40:04.740]  He is so bad
[01:40:04.740 --> 01:40:06.740]  The people he is associated with
[01:40:06.740 --> 01:40:08.740]  If he applied for a job
[01:40:08.740 --> 01:40:10.740]  As a Chicago police officer
[01:40:10.740 --> 01:40:12.740]  He couldn't even get the job because of the negotiations
[01:40:12.740 --> 01:40:14.740]  With Bill Ayers and Reverend
[01:40:14.740 --> 01:40:16.740]  The other people around him
[01:40:16.740 --> 01:40:18.740]  He couldn't get a job as an FBI agent
[01:40:18.740 --> 01:40:20.740]  Or a Secret Service agent
[01:40:20.740 --> 01:40:22.740]  If they're protecting him now
[01:40:22.740 --> 01:40:24.740]  I mean, this guy is so bad
[01:40:24.740 --> 01:40:26.740]  We don't know how he came on the scene
[01:40:26.740 --> 01:40:28.740]  We don't know who the payor for it went to
[01:40:28.740 --> 01:40:30.740]  He deceived the American public
[01:40:30.740 --> 01:40:32.740]  And I think he's getting blackmailed now
[01:40:32.740 --> 01:40:34.740]  I think I might have mentioned this before
[01:40:34.740 --> 01:40:36.740]  But think about it, the cabinet he has
[01:40:36.740 --> 01:40:38.740]  Is not a cabinet of change
[01:40:38.740 --> 01:40:40.740]  It's basically Bill Clinton's cabinet
[01:40:40.740 --> 01:40:42.740]  70%
[01:40:42.740 --> 01:40:44.740]  The programs he's put forth in the past 15 months
[01:40:44.740 --> 01:40:46.740]  It's not a program of change
[01:40:46.740 --> 01:40:48.740]  I think he's being told what to do
[01:40:48.740 --> 01:40:50.740]  Remember Alexey at the beginning
[01:40:50.740 --> 01:40:52.740]  He wanted to keep his blackberry
[01:40:52.740 --> 01:40:54.740]  So I don't know whatever happened
[01:40:54.740 --> 01:40:56.740]  But that's probably how he gets messages
[01:40:56.740 --> 01:40:58.740]  Someone's controlling him
[01:40:58.740 --> 01:41:00.740]  Someone's telling him what to do
[01:41:00.740 --> 01:41:02.740]  That works right, you're a fraud, you're a phony
[01:41:02.740 --> 01:41:04.740]  You want to be president, you got to play ball our way
[01:41:04.740 --> 01:41:06.740]  I think that's what we have the cabinet we have
[01:41:06.740 --> 01:41:08.740]  That's what we have the push on the program he has
[01:41:08.740 --> 01:41:10.740]  But it's time, listen
[01:41:10.740 --> 01:41:12.740]  What they did this healthcare is outrageous
[01:41:12.740 --> 01:41:14.740]  When 80% of people in this country
[01:41:14.740 --> 01:41:16.740]  Say we don't want it
[01:41:16.740 --> 01:41:18.740]  They go ahead and pass something like that
[01:41:18.740 --> 01:41:20.740]  Hopefully the 80% of people will stay together
[01:41:20.740 --> 01:41:22.740]  And vote out
[01:41:22.740 --> 01:41:24.740]  Every one of these people that would say
[01:41:24.740 --> 01:41:26.740]  And now they're saying they're going to spend
[01:41:26.740 --> 01:41:28.740]  $3 billion
[01:41:28.740 --> 01:41:30.740]  $2.5 billion, $3 billion a year
[01:41:30.740 --> 01:41:32.740]  In government run TV ads
[01:41:32.740 --> 01:41:34.740]  With taxpayer money telling us
[01:41:34.740 --> 01:41:36.740]  How great this is
[01:41:36.740 --> 01:41:38.740]  And lying to us over the next 10 years
[01:41:38.740 --> 01:41:40.740]  I mean how much money is that
[01:41:40.740 --> 01:41:42.740]  The next 3, that's 9 billion
[01:41:42.740 --> 01:41:44.740]  I guess it's more than 20 something billion
[01:41:44.740 --> 01:41:46.740]  I mean this is totally
[01:41:46.740 --> 01:41:48.740]  Insane
[01:41:48.740 --> 01:41:50.740]  And what scares me Phil is
[01:41:50.740 --> 01:41:52.740]  This is an all or nothing game for these people
[01:41:52.740 --> 01:41:54.740]  They're clearly going for broke
[01:41:54.740 --> 01:41:56.740]  And I agree with Michael Savage
[01:41:56.740 --> 01:41:58.740]  I believe Obama may stage terror attacks
[01:41:58.740 --> 01:42:00.740]  To blame it on his political enemies
[01:42:00.740 --> 01:42:02.740]  As a pretext
[01:42:02.740 --> 01:42:04.740]  To save his agenda
[01:42:04.740 --> 01:42:06.740]  I wouldn't doubt anything about him
[01:42:06.740 --> 01:42:08.740]  But how about the other parts of Medicare
[01:42:08.740 --> 01:42:10.740]  He says there could take
[01:42:10.740 --> 01:42:12.740]  $500 billion
[01:42:12.740 --> 01:42:14.740]  Out of Medicare
[01:42:14.740 --> 01:42:16.740]  But then as you're dancing to tell people on Medicare
[01:42:16.740 --> 01:42:18.740]  That none of your benefits really get cut
[01:42:18.740 --> 01:42:20.740]  I mean
[01:42:20.740 --> 01:42:22.740]  Yeah let me stop you again, they're saying
[01:42:22.740 --> 01:42:24.740]  $30 plus million
[01:42:24.740 --> 01:42:26.740]  By insurance who are working poor
[01:42:26.740 --> 01:42:28.740]  And then they're saying another
[01:42:28.740 --> 01:42:30.740]  $10 to $15 million will go on
[01:42:30.740 --> 01:42:32.740]  Medicare
[01:42:32.740 --> 01:42:34.740]  And Medicaid
[01:42:34.740 --> 01:42:36.740]  But they're going to cut it by $500 billion
[01:42:36.740 --> 01:42:38.740]  That's their number
[01:42:38.740 --> 01:42:40.740]  Some of the numbers show it's a trillion
[01:42:40.740 --> 01:42:42.740]  How do you bring more people on the program
[01:42:42.740 --> 01:42:44.740]  And cut the funding
[01:42:44.740 --> 01:42:46.740]  And then still give the care
[01:42:46.740 --> 01:42:48.740]  No more
[01:42:48.740 --> 01:42:50.740]  Mr. Night Sky
[01:42:50.740 --> 01:42:52.740]  No more
[01:42:52.740 --> 01:42:54.740]  Mr. Night Sky
[01:42:54.740 --> 01:42:56.740]  No more
[01:42:56.740 --> 01:42:58.740]  Mr. Night Sky
[01:42:58.740 --> 01:43:00.740]  Hello this is Alex Jones
[01:43:00.740 --> 01:43:02.740]  With some important questions
[01:43:02.740 --> 01:43:04.740]  If you're going into a battle
[01:43:04.740 --> 01:43:06.740]  And they give you a rifle and a sidearm
[01:43:06.740 --> 01:43:08.740]  How much ammunition do you want
[01:43:08.740 --> 01:43:10.740]  My answer would be all I can get
[01:43:10.740 --> 01:43:12.740]  In the battle for freedom
[01:43:12.740 --> 01:43:14.740]  And the lives of your loved ones
[01:43:14.740 --> 01:43:16.740]  Food is your only ammunition
[01:43:16.740 --> 01:43:18.740]  How much do you want
[01:43:18.740 --> 01:43:20.740]  When do you want it
[01:43:20.740 --> 01:43:22.740]  Without proper identification
[01:43:22.740 --> 01:43:24.740]  Will there be any food
[01:43:24.740 --> 01:43:26.740]  Will it make your children sick
[01:43:26.740 --> 01:43:28.740]  If there's a quarantine
[01:43:28.740 --> 01:43:30.740]  And you can't feed yourself
[01:43:30.740 --> 01:43:32.740]  Will you go to the gathering center
[01:43:32.740 --> 01:43:34.740]  And be immunized
[01:43:34.740 --> 01:43:36.740]  You wipe out all these problems
[01:43:36.740 --> 01:43:38.740]  If you have a good food supply
[01:43:38.740 --> 01:43:40.740]  Food is your ammunition
[01:43:40.740 --> 01:43:42.740]  To fight for your freedom and your life
[01:43:42.740 --> 01:43:44.740]  How much will you need
[01:43:44.740 --> 01:43:46.740]  We don't know
[01:43:46.740 --> 01:43:48.740]  How much do you want
[01:43:48.740 --> 01:43:50.740]  5633
[01:43:50.740 --> 01:43:52.740]  Or check it out on the web

[01:43:58.740 --> 01:44:00.740]  One major world crisis away
[01:44:00.740 --> 01:44:02.740]  From having a totalitarian type
[01:44:02.740 --> 01:44:04.740]  Of system
[01:44:04.740 --> 01:44:06.740]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world
[01:44:06.740 --> 01:44:08.740]  To push for every nation on the globe
[01:44:08.740 --> 01:44:10.740]  To identify and number
[01:44:10.740 --> 01:44:12.740]  All of its citizens

[01:44:54.740 --> 01:45:22.740]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again. So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds. They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce a lot more.
[01:45:22.740 --> 01:45:38.740]  An endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family. And here's the best part. These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden. So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:45:38.740 --> 01:45:49.740]  That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365. That's 877-327-0365.
[01:45:49.740 --> 01:45:57.740]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item. This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:46:20.740 --> 01:46:31.740]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:46:31.740 --> 01:46:36.740]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:46:36.740 --> 01:46:39.740]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:46:39.740 --> 01:46:45.740]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite, and then everyone else. And I got news for you. You're everyone else.
[01:46:45.740 --> 01:46:56.740]  Invisible Empire, secure your copy today at infowars.com or prismplanet.com, or watch it online in the highest quality at prismplanet.tv.
[01:47:16.740 --> 01:47:24.740]  In the last 35 years is what's screwed up our healthcare. So we're going to get James Dillingpole's take on that, his website's jamesdillingpole.com.
[01:47:24.740 --> 01:47:31.740]  He's also a best-selling author. We'll tell you all about that before he leaves us with a best-selling book on Obama.
[01:47:31.740 --> 01:47:37.740]  And it certainly turned out to be very, very accurate. It was released right as Obama got into office last year.
[01:47:37.740 --> 01:47:43.740]  But this isn't just James Dillingpole saying this. This is the National Post of Canada.
[01:47:43.740 --> 01:47:46.740]  Here's the London Guardian giving me a document cam shot.
[01:47:46.740 --> 01:47:55.740]  How going green may make you mean ethical consumers less likely to be kind and more likely to steal, many times more likely.
[01:47:55.740 --> 01:48:05.740]  And the BBC even said, oh, the greenies are criminals. Dillingpole had a tongue-in-cheek article, but very serious in the body.
[01:48:05.740 --> 01:48:13.740]  Greens sacrifice babies to Satan, sell grandmothers into slavery except. Well, remember what happened down in Latin America last month?
[01:48:13.740 --> 01:48:21.740]  You had a wife and husband kill themselves and then try to kill the baby because they were worried about global warming.
[01:48:21.740 --> 01:48:29.740]  In fact, here's a story out of the telegraph. Liars cheats thieves. The terrible truth about the mean greens.
[01:48:29.740 --> 01:48:36.740]  Here's another one. Are green consumers more unethical? Look, these people, you go to a grocery store.
[01:48:36.740 --> 01:48:44.740]  The paper bags bust on you. I've read the statistics that they actually create more acid, more pulp, more energy used.
[01:48:44.740 --> 01:48:51.740]  No, not that that matters. That's industry. It's renewable. The plastic is actually better, but they don't care.
[01:48:51.740 --> 01:48:56.740]  They will get in your face about it. These people want your house. They want your car.
[01:48:56.740 --> 01:49:01.740]  And if you go to Zoker Park, there's glass everywhere in Austin, just everywhere, all over the ground.
[01:49:01.740 --> 01:49:10.740]  Anyone that parks an SUV, it happened to us, gets it keyed. If you're lucky, normally windows locked out, tires slashed.
[01:49:10.740 --> 01:49:16.740]  Hey, listen, I got three children. I got my wife when my parents went someplace with us a few weeks ago.
[01:49:16.740 --> 01:49:24.740]  All of us, all seven of us could ride in the car, but these little control freaks want to run our lives.
[01:49:24.740 --> 01:49:28.740]  Now, I'm ranting. I apologize to Dillingpole. We're going to get into this coming up.
[01:49:28.740 --> 01:49:36.740]  But first, I wanted to get into government-run healthcare and what it's really like from Air Strip 1 in this 1984 system.
[01:49:36.740 --> 01:49:38.740]  Mr. Dillingpole, good to have you with us.
[01:49:38.740 --> 01:49:45.740]  Thank you for having me back, Alex. So you want to tell you about the British National Health Service experience?
[01:49:45.740 --> 01:49:52.740]  Well, it seems to me that there are two ways of allocating scarce resources to do with health.
[01:49:52.740 --> 01:49:58.740]  And one way is to do it through the market to, you know, if you pay, then you will get service.
[01:49:58.740 --> 01:50:04.740]  The other way, which is what we've got here in Britain, is a form of state rationing.
[01:50:04.740 --> 01:50:10.740]  Now, maybe this way of allocating healthcare was appropriate immediately after the Second World War.
[01:50:10.740 --> 01:50:15.740]  But somehow I feel that the world has moved beyond the Second World War mentality,
[01:50:15.740 --> 01:50:23.740]  where you're kind of grateful for what you get and, you know, you're happy to queue up for your rubbish service.
[01:50:23.740 --> 01:50:31.740]  The fact is that Britain has the lowest cancer survival rate in the G8.
[01:50:31.740 --> 01:50:35.740]  That in itself is a pretty grim indictment of our system.
[01:50:35.740 --> 01:50:43.740]  We also have, I don't know whether you follow this in America, we had the scandal of Stafford Hospital,
[01:50:43.740 --> 01:50:51.740]  the hospital where as many as 1,200 patients may have died because of government targets.
[01:50:51.740 --> 01:50:57.740]  Oh, I saw an article last week where the guy just showed up over three days and died on a gurney.
[01:50:57.740 --> 01:51:06.740]  Yeah, this sort of thing happens. At this particular hospital, patients were being left unwashed for up to a month.
[01:51:06.740 --> 01:51:10.740]  They were abandoned in their soiled bloodstains sheets.
[01:51:10.740 --> 01:51:14.740]  Nurses weren't doing anything about it. They weren't giving them water.
[01:51:14.740 --> 01:51:17.740]  Patients were crying out in pain.
[01:51:17.740 --> 01:51:20.740]  Now, I'm not saying that this is necessarily the common experience, you know,
[01:51:20.740 --> 01:51:24.740]  that everyone suffers every time they go into a National Health Service hospital.
[01:51:24.740 --> 01:51:27.740]  Sometimes you do get good treatment.
[01:51:27.740 --> 01:51:40.740]  You know, when you do, I burned my hand once and after my three hours in a waiting room that made the Star Wars cantina scene look like Baywatch,
[01:51:40.740 --> 01:51:42.740]  eventually I got my treatment.
[01:51:42.740 --> 01:51:49.740]  But you do have to wait a very long time and often the service you get is rather grudging
[01:51:49.740 --> 01:51:54.740]  because you are treated as a supplicant, not as a paying customer.
[01:51:54.740 --> 01:51:58.740]  You are treated more or less like you don't really deserve to be there.
[01:51:58.740 --> 01:52:01.740]  Well, that's what Tom Dashel three years ago said in his book.
[01:52:01.740 --> 01:52:06.740]  We've been reading the quotes where we need to be like Europe where old people know they have a duty to die.
[01:52:06.740 --> 01:52:12.740]  The moment you give big government a say in allocating health care,
[01:52:12.740 --> 01:52:18.740]  big government also feels it suddenly has the right to tell you how you should live your life,
[01:52:18.740 --> 01:52:22.740]  how much you drink, how fatty your food is,
[01:52:22.740 --> 01:52:29.740]  they're already saying $1,000 fines in jail time for salting your food in New York State.
[01:52:29.740 --> 01:52:33.740]  I see them pushing similar things now in England.
[01:52:33.740 --> 01:52:39.740]  Absolutely, absolutely. We have this traffic light system now on our food and supermarkets
[01:52:39.740 --> 01:52:46.740]  whereby red means dangerous, amber means treat with caution and green means go.
[01:52:46.740 --> 01:52:49.740]  It's safe and low in cholesterol and stuff.
[01:52:49.740 --> 01:52:54.740]  And they're setting the precedent to literally run your life and tax certain foods more.
[01:52:54.740 --> 01:52:56.740]  I mean, they're openly saying this.
[01:52:56.740 --> 01:53:01.740]  Absolutely, there was no question about it because you see, once government starts spending money,
[01:53:01.740 --> 01:53:06.740]  I mean, your money, let's not forget, when government starts spending your money on health care,
[01:53:06.740 --> 01:53:11.740]  it thinks that the best way of making the service cheaper and getting better value for money
[01:53:11.740 --> 01:53:13.740]  is not through the actual service it provides,
[01:53:13.740 --> 01:53:21.740]  by spending a fortune on advertising and measures to forcing free individuals to behaving
[01:53:21.740 --> 01:53:25.740]  in a way that conforms with the government's idea of health.
[01:53:25.740 --> 01:53:29.740]  So, you know, abnormal behavior is not allowed anymore.
[01:53:29.740 --> 01:53:34.740]  You have to eat lettuce and live like a rabbit and not drink alcohol anymore,
[01:53:34.740 --> 01:53:35.740]  and definitely not smoke.
[01:53:35.740 --> 01:53:40.740]  Or you won't get, you know, treat it, you won't get the medical treatment that you paid for.
[01:53:40.740 --> 01:53:47.740]  And that's why they love to collectivize things because then they get all of the rabble that's on the dole
[01:53:47.740 --> 01:53:51.740]  angry at not just people with more money than them with class warfare,
[01:53:51.740 --> 01:53:55.740]  but now they're not just angry about the plastic bags or your big car.
[01:53:55.740 --> 01:53:57.740]  Now they're looking at what you're ordering.
[01:53:57.740 --> 01:54:02.740]  Yeah, of course, the other thing you get is, I don't know how familiar you are with this,
[01:54:02.740 --> 01:54:04.740]  you're going to get lots of health tourism.
[01:54:04.740 --> 01:54:08.740]  I mean, the number of health tourists we get from the third world coming over here,
[01:54:08.740 --> 01:54:13.740]  sneaking into the system and, you know, getting treatment that they haven't paid for is,
[01:54:13.740 --> 01:54:18.740]  you know, it costs the British Exchequer a lot of money.
[01:54:18.740 --> 01:54:21.740]  So our service goes down and down and down.
[01:54:21.740 --> 01:54:25.740]  And, you know, you have to wait longer and longer and longer for treatment.
[01:54:25.740 --> 01:54:28.740]  By the way, I just pulled this article up.
[01:54:28.740 --> 01:54:32.740]  I have seen scores of cases in Kansas City, but also at Walter Reed,
[01:54:32.740 --> 01:54:34.740]  another part of the country.
[01:54:34.740 --> 01:54:36.740]  In fact, here's the Washington Post.
[01:54:36.740 --> 01:54:38.740]  Pentagon is probing veterans home.
[01:54:38.740 --> 01:54:42.740]  The government accountability office warned the Pentagon this week that residents of a home
[01:54:42.740 --> 01:54:46.740]  may be at risk in line of allegations of severe health care problems.
[01:54:46.740 --> 01:54:51.740]  Residents have been admitted to Walter Reed Army Medical Center with the most serious type of pressure sores.
[01:54:51.740 --> 01:54:55.740]  And in one case, this is one of many, with maggots in a wound,
[01:54:55.740 --> 01:55:00.740]  a bunch of vets have died from a special type of fly that goes up into the nose
[01:55:00.740 --> 01:55:05.740]  and lays eggs in the mucous membrane, and then they have a meal of your brain.
[01:55:05.740 --> 01:55:10.740]  So I guess we're getting screwworms now that we eradicated for cows now feasting on the vets.
[01:55:10.740 --> 01:55:16.740]  The one place where the government does run the health care and it's absolutely abhorrent.
[01:55:16.740 --> 01:55:21.740]  Yeah, well, I mean, this is welcome to our world.
[01:55:21.740 --> 01:55:26.740]  This is what it's been like for the last 50 years in Britain.
[01:55:26.740 --> 01:55:28.740]  How do they enforce it in England?
[01:55:28.740 --> 01:55:34.740]  They just take the tax money with other taxes because here they're saying the IRS is now going to be our nanny
[01:55:34.740 --> 01:55:36.740]  and basically run our lives.
[01:55:36.740 --> 01:55:38.740]  Oh, yeah, we have no choice.
[01:55:38.740 --> 01:55:46.740]  I mean, our tax burden has risen enormously in the last 12, 13 years under our socialist government.
[01:55:46.740 --> 01:55:54.740]  And they've spent more and more of our money on this creaking health system, which has not improved one job.
[01:55:54.740 --> 01:55:56.740]  So it's got more and more expensive.
[01:55:56.740 --> 01:56:00.740]  It's required more and more layers of management particularly.
[01:56:00.740 --> 01:56:07.740]  So you've got more and more bureaucrats for every hospital bed and fewer and fewer actual nurses.
[01:56:07.740 --> 01:56:12.740]  So the system has got, you know, this is socialism in action.
[01:56:12.740 --> 01:56:17.740]  You get bureaucrats paid for at taxpayer's expense and the system gets worse and worse and worse.
[01:56:17.740 --> 01:56:21.740]  And you have no say in the matter.
[01:56:21.740 --> 01:56:27.740]  You can't complain about the service you get because, as I said, you are treated like a supplicant, not like a customer.
[01:56:27.740 --> 01:56:31.740]  So you pay for it with tax money, but that's not good enough.
[01:56:31.740 --> 01:56:40.740]  And then third world populations pour in who are on the dole and don't even, in many cases, work and it gets more and more bankrupt.
[01:56:40.740 --> 01:56:42.740]  Where is this headed in England?
[01:56:42.740 --> 01:56:44.740]  So we can get an idea where it's headed here.
[01:56:44.740 --> 01:56:48.740]  Oh, I mean, you know, our country is going the way of Greece.
[01:56:48.740 --> 01:56:54.740]  We have a massive structural deficit, you know, running into billions of pounds.
[01:56:54.740 --> 01:57:03.740]  And our government has not faced up to the fact that it cannot afford to spend any more of the taxpayer's money.
[01:57:03.740 --> 01:57:10.740]  I mean, already the public sector of the economy is now just overtaken the private sector,
[01:57:10.740 --> 01:57:22.740]  which means that, you know, for obvious reasons, if you've got ordinary, hardworking businessmen and people supporting more than 51% of the economy,
[01:57:22.740 --> 01:57:25.740]  you have a recipe for financial disaster.
[01:57:25.740 --> 01:57:26.740]  And this is what's happening now.
[01:57:26.740 --> 01:57:28.740]  We cannot afford the NHS.
[01:57:28.740 --> 01:57:31.740]  We cannot afford anything, really.
[01:57:31.740 --> 01:57:53.740]  We are a nation of bureaucrats.
