[00:00.000 --> 00:10.280]  Waging War on Corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[00:10.280 --> 00:34.440]  the Info War. 17 years ago, jetliners crashed into the World Trade Center towers one and
[00:34.440 --> 00:41.720]  two. Building seven later that day was destroyed in a controlled demolition. We were there
[00:41.720 --> 00:46.800]  live on air covering it. What an incredible time in history as we remember all those poor
[00:46.800 --> 00:52.840]  souls that died and the great heroes that tried to save so many. They rushed in when
[00:52.840 --> 01:01.800]  others rushed out. We should honor them today and we will be. And of course, history happening
[01:01.800 --> 01:07.920]  now. The stars aligning only 56 days out from the most historic election in world history.
[01:07.920 --> 01:11.920]  I've been saying that for over a year. Now you see Obama saying it. Hillary saying it.
[01:11.920 --> 01:16.560]  The global is saying it because it's a referendum on their world government and a referendum
[01:16.560 --> 01:24.320]  on Internet censorship and incredible crackdowns and Amazon now banning hundreds of books.
[01:24.320 --> 01:31.600]  That's right. We got an article on info wars.com. It's on drudgerport.com. We're a popular dating
[01:31.600 --> 01:39.200]  guide book that tells guys to be cocky and alpha male, which is how you do get the most
[01:39.200 --> 01:45.240]  women that you're looking for. The problem will then be getting rid of them. I'm not
[01:45.240 --> 01:49.760]  trying to be mean, but it teaches, you know, guys that have been shut as their whole lives,
[01:49.760 --> 01:55.960]  how to be more confident and just basic mammal mating tactics. Seven, no, no, nine of his
[01:55.960 --> 02:00.200]  books are banned in one day, but it's a bunch of other conservatives and nationalists and
[02:00.200 --> 02:04.080]  people criticizing Islam. They're all being banned as well. It's just that they're not
[02:04.080 --> 02:09.240]  getting any attention when it happens. So it's on. And of course his crime. Well, his
[02:09.240 --> 02:13.240]  book was going towards number one, his new book. The first day it went on sale. So Paul
[02:13.240 --> 02:20.520]  Watson will interview that gentleman coming up today in the fourth hour. So look for that
[02:20.520 --> 02:27.160]  at info wars.com and news wars.com. Now the really big news. We've got the anniversary
[02:27.160 --> 02:32.040]  of 9 11. We've got Iranian sleeper cells threatening to launch new attacks in the US. And that's
[02:32.040 --> 02:40.320]  a real terror group. We've got looming war with Syria and US bombardments that are going
[02:40.320 --> 02:43.880]  on and not even getting any attention. We've got 56 days out from the election, all the
[02:43.880 --> 02:50.440]  intensifying censorship, but what's the big enchilada? Well, the Department of Energy
[02:50.440 --> 02:54.840]  and the nuclear regulatory agencies have come out. We have a detailed report coming out
[02:54.840 --> 02:59.880]  at noon and Mike Adams, the engineer will be joining us with maps and more. Hurricane
[02:59.880 --> 03:06.400]  Florence could threaten 10 nuclear power facilities. And we know that we have some of the most
[03:06.400 --> 03:13.160]  aging nuclear plants in the world. There are 467 nuclear power plants. There are several
[03:13.160 --> 03:17.800]  hundred other experimental plants, two of which are in Austin, and many of them are
[03:17.800 --> 03:24.360]  old and rotting. And so this is a category six hurricane estimated when it makes land
[03:24.360 --> 03:31.960]  fall, when it slams into South and North Carolina, is its attack vector at this point. You're
[03:31.960 --> 03:37.800]  seeing a massive exodus out of that area, obviously ahead of the storm. We'll be going
[03:37.800 --> 03:45.920]  over all of this here on the broadcast today. Big focus on the hurricane with expert analysis
[03:45.920 --> 03:52.000]  in the second hour. And then I've heard a show many times, just went on a few weeks
[03:52.000 --> 04:02.000]  ago and I was amazed by Clyde Lewis, because I used to go to bed pretty late. But then
[04:02.000 --> 04:04.800]  when you end up having four children, you end up going to bed earlier and earlier. So
[04:04.800 --> 04:09.000]  I go to bed a lot of times about nine o'clock. So I'm listening to his show in quite a while.
[04:09.000 --> 04:14.200]  But I tuned into it when I was on, obviously, and it was just amazing his knowledge of the
[04:14.200 --> 04:21.280]  deep state, the Marshall law plan, and things I'd forgotten about that blew me away. The
[04:21.280 --> 04:26.160]  internet kill switch stay behind groups Obama put in place. And I was remembering as he
[04:26.160 --> 04:30.240]  said it, and I was sitting there, search engineering at my computer in the kitchen when I was
[04:30.240 --> 04:34.560]  on for three hours the other night. And I was like, you got to come on my show. I mean,
[04:34.560 --> 04:38.520]  this is amazing. So this is really important Intel. The reason they banned the show is
[04:38.520 --> 04:43.120]  it were exposed in the whole deep state situation. That's coming up the third hour. Paul Watson
[04:43.120 --> 04:48.240]  has the guy that has books banned. And Amazon got contacted by the media and they said, yeah,
[04:48.240 --> 04:51.880]  we banned his books. So what are you gonna do about it? I can tell you why. I'll tell
[04:51.880 --> 04:55.920]  you why because it's they don't want men and women mating. They don't want us coming together.
[04:55.920 --> 05:00.880]  They want us divided. And it's all about targeting our reproductive systems.
[05:00.880 --> 05:06.000]  Fueling your body is hard work. That's why we've introduced the info wars life daily

[06:04.640 --> 06:13.720]  You are listening to an info wars dot com frontline report. If you are receiving this transmission,
[06:13.720 --> 06:28.120]  you are the resistance. From deep in the heart of FEMA region six, Austin, Texas, transmitting
[06:28.120 --> 06:43.480]  worldwide. It's Alex Jones. 56 days out, ladies and gentlemen, the most important election
[06:43.480 --> 06:50.000]  in world history. We've got 10 nuclear power plants that the Department of Energy admits
[06:50.000 --> 06:59.120]  are in the path of a category six hurricane. Hurricane Florence were praying that it slows
[06:59.120 --> 07:06.280]  down. But if it hits as a category six, you're talking spectacular devastation. Could it be
[07:06.280 --> 07:11.880]  an American Fukushima? We've already had multiple nukes blow up in the United States
[07:11.880 --> 07:18.680]  before one back in the 50s in California and no one even knew to the 80s when it was declassified.
[07:18.680 --> 07:27.800]  It was as bad as Fukushima. The plants are on average 40 years old and rotting. 92% of
[07:27.800 --> 07:33.440]  worldwide plants are leaking. Again, I've been a fan of technology growing up, a fan
[07:33.440 --> 07:38.240]  of nuclear power because I thought they would responsibly try to control it. These big corporations
[07:38.240 --> 07:46.880]  will not do it. This is a serious, serious, serious situation. We are going to be covering
[07:46.880 --> 07:52.880]  it with Mike Adams for 30 minutes or longer at the start of the second hour. And I have
[07:52.880 --> 07:57.920]  Clyde Lewis joining us, who is just a real expert on the deep state. And I was on with
[07:57.920 --> 08:01.160]  him for three hours on his big syndicated show that comes on before George Norris on
[08:01.160 --> 08:08.040]  the same network, on the premier radio network. And he was mentioning all this history and
[08:08.040 --> 08:13.840]  all this research that I had totally forgotten. All these other agencies Obama set up and
[08:13.840 --> 08:19.200]  the kill switch office and how they put these groups inside the FCC to take control of the
[08:19.200 --> 08:24.600]  internet. And it was blowing me away. And I was sitting there, search engine, everything
[08:24.600 --> 08:29.200]  he was saying, like, oh, I forgot about that. I forgot about this. So it's amazing and it's
[08:29.200 --> 08:34.800]  important to know. And it's all coming up in the third hour. Then Paul Watson has the
[08:34.800 --> 08:40.880]  gentleman joining him who had nine of his books banned in one day and Amazon admits that they've
[08:40.880 --> 08:44.440]  banned them. You say, oh, they're a private company. Well, now the left is moving for
[08:44.440 --> 08:49.680]  people's credit card processors and their own online shopping carts. And the Washington
[08:49.680 --> 08:54.640]  Post has a big article out saying as Alex Jones rails against big tech, his info or
[08:54.640 --> 09:00.440]  stores still thrive online. And the article basically talks about how to take me down
[09:00.440 --> 09:06.840]  completely. And how I'm horrible because I sell supplements, but Jeff Bezos that owns
[09:06.840 --> 09:15.880]  the Washington Post is the biggest supplement salesman in the world. And nine of the supplements
[09:15.880 --> 09:20.680]  we sell are made by the same manufacturers as Whole Foods that are actually high quality
[09:20.680 --> 09:25.520]  that Bezos sells. And they even review some of the very things sold in Whole Foods under
[09:25.520 --> 09:31.840]  other names and say they're crap. And then in the New York Times and Washington Post,
[09:31.840 --> 09:35.840]  I mean, you talk about next, I'm going to be revealing in the next week what products
[09:35.840 --> 09:42.360]  I have that are private labeled off of Whole Foods brands. Some Whole Foods brands are not
[09:42.360 --> 09:48.400]  that good. Some are excellent. We go to top labs in the country and we, we find out whatever
[09:48.400 --> 09:51.320]  is the highest rated, whatever is the best, can we private label that and then sell it
[09:51.320 --> 09:59.120]  for a lower price. But Bezos can sell it all. He's a good guy. I do. And his criminal Washington
[09:59.120 --> 10:06.680]  Post trying to overthrow this country then demonizes me. What a sick freak. It is the
[10:06.680 --> 10:15.880]  17th anniversary of 9-11, 2001. What a tragedy. And they used that tragedy. Clear government
[10:15.880 --> 10:19.840]  stand down, which has now been declassified and part of the 28 pages has gone public that
[10:19.840 --> 10:24.520]  they knew it was going on. They ordered to stand down. Saudi Arabia was heavily involved.
[10:24.520 --> 10:29.920]  Instead of going out for Saudi Arabia, we went after Iraq, their arch enemy. That's the same
[10:29.920 --> 10:34.600]  story over and over and over again. We're going to be looking at all of that today as
[10:34.600 --> 10:40.400]  well. Very important transmission that no one wants to miss. Let me just do this. The
[10:40.400 --> 10:47.920]  time I have in this segment, let me, document cam shot here of the big table. Let me just
[10:47.920 --> 10:57.720]  show you the headlines. Hurricane Florence could threaten 10 nuclear power facilities.
[10:57.720 --> 11:02.800]  White House economist proves Trump reversed Obama's disastrous economic policies. Incredible
[11:02.800 --> 11:07.040]  nine minute video we're going to be playing where as soon as Trump gets in, the graphs
[11:07.040 --> 11:13.080]  are all going like this under Obama. It goes like this. I mean, that's what the graphs
[11:13.080 --> 11:17.000]  look like or they go like this and then it goes like this. I mean, it's the day he's
[11:17.000 --> 11:23.560]  elected. Now, why is that? Because the big corporations were directed not to invest here
[11:23.560 --> 11:27.400]  and that America under globalism was to be deindustrialized. That's official from George
[11:27.400 --> 11:32.040]  Herbert Walker Bush. That's when it really accelerated. It's in the UNESCO plan. Trump
[11:32.040 --> 11:37.680]  said we're out of this plan and he withdrew from UNESCO. And the first thing he did when
[11:37.680 --> 11:42.880]  he was president elect was signal we're getting out of the TPP. So that's all coming up. It's
[11:42.880 --> 11:52.360]  bombshell. And then US job openings climbed a record 6.9 million. Trump campaign manager
[11:52.360 --> 11:57.440]  Google a direct threat to democracy and online freedom. And then it ties into all the draconian
[11:57.440 --> 12:04.160]  censorship Fahrenheit 2018. Amazon begins banning controversial books, not Nambla books, but
[12:04.160 --> 12:10.680]  books telling guys how to be competent and confident. London mayor's approval rating
[12:10.680 --> 12:18.000]  hits its lowest point. Yet after summer of violence, male fertility in the West is in
[12:18.000 --> 12:22.160]  rapid decline. Major scientific studies. And I got to this some yesterday, but it's back
[12:22.160 --> 12:27.560]  in the news. Young blood could be the secret to long lasting life. Children's blood being
[12:27.560 --> 12:38.080]  sold by their parents for $8,000 a bag. I first broke 20 years ago that the queen mother
[12:38.080 --> 12:47.440]  took children's blood every day. See, that's why they want us off the air because the Vatican
[12:47.440 --> 12:52.640]  being run by pedophiles by Satanist. I told you, the raping the kids is only step one.
[12:52.640 --> 12:58.600]  Drinking their blood is what really goes on. And they torture children to death and they
[12:58.600 --> 13:02.920]  excrete all their fear and their hormones. And it's done just like you're reading Ram
[13:02.920 --> 13:06.640]  Stroker. You see in the old black and white vampire movies where Dracula brings a baby
[13:06.640 --> 13:13.760]  to the women. That's actually a ancient 3000 plus year old ritual from Babylon and Egypt.
[13:13.760 --> 13:18.120]  You can read an ancient text. I mean, this is in the archeology. You would bring them
[13:18.120 --> 13:22.000]  to women and then they would lance the baby while it cries and a whole bunch of women
[13:22.000 --> 13:27.720]  would suck the blood out of the baby. And then the men would have sex with the women.
[13:27.720 --> 13:31.600]  And then the women would do this. Obviously, when they were menstruating and the men would
[13:31.600 --> 13:38.800]  drink that. I'm not kidding. This is 101 Satanism, ladies and gentlemen. And it's rampant. It's
[13:38.800 --> 13:43.440]  rampant. We're going to get into that. Sorry, I have to hear this stuff. It's what's going
[13:43.440 --> 13:47.880]  on in Hollywood everywhere. But raping kids is the tip of the iceberg. Right beneath that
[13:47.880 --> 13:54.080]  is vampirism. More children are dying by suicide. Researchers are asking why USA Today because
[13:54.080 --> 13:59.120]  you teach them death education, the teachers amount of commit suicide. South Africa, their
[13:59.120 --> 14:03.920]  government says close to a war zone with 57 murders a day. A lot of them white. But our
[14:03.920 --> 14:07.480]  media says no whites are being killed. No African countries ever killed any whites or
[14:07.480 --> 14:14.280]  kicked them out even though six just did it. The border has massive surges, 200 plus percent
[14:14.280 --> 14:18.160]  arrest rate of illegals coming across. We're going to get into all that a lot of them Islamic
[14:18.160 --> 14:26.600]  and others. That's just some of what's coming up today. Now that said, I did not time this
[14:26.600 --> 14:31.560]  for the fact that there's nuclear power plants that can be leaking or hit by this hurricane.
[14:31.560 --> 14:37.440]  I did not time this. It's just a fact. I've told you for a long time that I don't take
[14:37.440 --> 14:42.840]  clean, pure, deep earth, crystal iodine because I'm worried about radiation. That's only for
[14:42.840 --> 14:47.940]  one type that goes into thyroid during a meltdown. Radioactive iodine. So good iodine fills
[14:47.940 --> 14:52.640]  your thyroid to the bad iodine. It doesn't get in there. The radioactive iodine. I take
[14:52.640 --> 14:58.800]  it because you die without iodine. It's associated with IQ, everything. You have to have it.
[14:58.800 --> 15:04.800]  It's like vitamin C. It's like oxygen. It's like water. And most of its bound up deficiencies
[15:04.800 --> 15:09.680]  are insane. Anybody can search mainline studies. 15 point IQ increases when people get higher
[15:09.680 --> 15:16.480]  levels of iodine during childhood development. We have the very best deep earth, crystal
[15:16.480 --> 15:23.040]  iodine. And the oil companies that get it between 7 and 11,000 feet have been jacking
[15:23.040 --> 15:27.800]  up prices in the last few years as we're the only ones that have this deep earth, crystal
[15:27.800 --> 15:33.200]  source. And it's all proprietary. So I put in a really big order last time and played
[15:33.200 --> 15:37.760]  Gutsball and said, you got to cut prices. They didn't. So I broke the contract and this
[15:37.760 --> 15:41.400]  is the last. We may be able to get another source. We're working on it right now. But
[15:41.400 --> 15:46.240]  if you want X2, our best selling amazing product that blows every other so called iodine away,
[15:46.240 --> 15:51.760]  it's available 25% off at infowarstore.com. But this is the final run of X2. If you want

[17:57.920 --> 18:05.760]  InfoWarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine. Introducing PollenBlock.
[18:05.760 --> 18:11.040]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[18:11.040 --> 18:17.800]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[18:17.800 --> 18:23.680]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[18:23.680 --> 18:29.040]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses. They began studying this effect in published
[18:29.040 --> 18:34.440]  trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable
[18:34.440 --> 18:40.160]  tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms. PollenBlock is natural and effective.
[18:40.160 --> 18:45.200]  It is not an antihistamine. In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by
[18:45.200 --> 18:50.480]  blocking the activity of triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory
[18:50.480 --> 18:56.800]  responses in the body. Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe. Head to infowarslife.com
[18:56.800 --> 19:00.400]  and grab a pack of our PollenBlock chewable tablets.
[19:00.400 --> 19:05.400]  InfoWarsLife is launching its newest product. We're really, really proud of it. It's a
[19:05.400 --> 19:13.240]  best-source, prebiotic fiber, and it's got the very best concentrated fibers from berries

[19:58.640 --> 20:03.040]  in 4slife.com.
[20:03.040 --> 20:21.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:21.040 --> 20:28.680]  Alex Jones, the cure to fake news coming to you live from Austin, Texas.
[20:52.040 --> 20:58.520]  Coming up in the next segment, I am going to air the White House chief economist, Incredible.
[20:58.520 --> 21:04.240]  The head of his economic council's incredible breakdown with 10 different charts he shows
[21:04.240 --> 21:11.040]  using federal numbers of the complete turnaround of the economy. Now, radio listeners, you'll
[21:11.040 --> 21:18.200]  want to go to infowars.com forward slash show. And you will want to see this for yourself.
[21:18.200 --> 21:22.240]  That's not even one of the most dramatic charts. They've got six or seven. Go straight up.
[21:22.240 --> 21:26.760]  The day Trump is elected because America is open for business again. And the globalists
[21:26.760 --> 21:32.280]  have been prohibiting our economy from growing by design. That's an admission under UN treaty.
[21:32.280 --> 21:38.440]  So that's all coming up. But for radio listeners, I will just pause it and point out verbally
[21:38.440 --> 21:42.200]  what the chart is showing and the numbers that it's showing. But the full video is up
[21:42.200 --> 21:47.800]  on infowars.com. I know Paul Watts is going to tweet it out at Prison Planet. This is
[21:47.800 --> 21:51.200]  what the globalists are fighting to keep you from seeing. I mean, if you're a TV viewer,
[21:51.200 --> 22:00.080]  look at that dramaticness. The red line in the middle shows the day that Trump was elected
[22:00.080 --> 22:05.240]  and then look at the absolute parabolic straight up afterwards. Unbelievable. But that's the
[22:05.240 --> 22:16.120]  next segment. I want to hit a giant media hoax that has been on MSNBC. It's been on CNN.
[22:16.120 --> 22:22.840]  It's been on a bunch of online news services. And when it was happening, I had a feeling
[22:22.840 --> 22:30.000]  it was going to happen because everything we do gets turned upside down. That's all
[22:30.000 --> 22:40.440]  the left does. They're murderers of the truth. So I walk out of the Senate hearing Wednesday
[22:40.440 --> 22:49.160]  at like one o'clock, getting ready to go over to the House hearings. And these women come
[22:49.160 --> 22:55.000]  over and they start screaming and yelling at me and calling me a monkey. And by the time
[22:55.000 --> 22:59.360]  we turn the camera on, I think, oh, God, we didn't catch them calling me a monkey. No,
[22:59.360 --> 23:03.960]  they keep calling me a monkey. You're an inbred white person. Your mother's married to her
[23:03.960 --> 23:13.040]  son. You're a monkey. You're a pilgrim. Get out of here. And I'm just just used to the
[23:13.040 --> 23:17.680]  left's total racism that whites are the devil. So I start saying you're brown KKK guarantee
[23:17.680 --> 23:23.800]  these women were members of Metro and La Raza. They were spewing their propaganda. So they're
[23:23.800 --> 23:30.280]  in my face doing all this. And sure enough, national news, you name it, edited this all
[23:30.280 --> 23:36.880]  together. And I started getting calls about it. Well, and even one of my lawyers called
[23:36.880 --> 23:39.720]  me, he's like, Alex, you probably shouldn't be yelling at Hispanic women and calling them
[23:39.720 --> 23:44.480]  racist for no reason. I'm like, did you watch the full tape? No, you didn't. So that's how
[23:44.480 --> 23:49.040]  these hoaxes work. Some guy in Missouri pushes a kid over that's punched him four times in
[23:49.040 --> 23:55.320]  the face. The national news says I beat up a kid and I'm taking off YouTube. These are
[23:55.320 --> 24:04.640]  hoaxes. These are total and complete hoaxes. And I'm going to show you the proof of the
[24:04.640 --> 24:12.440]  hoax right now. Now here is a quick 14 second compilation of these women that came up to
[24:12.440 --> 24:16.000]  me yelling at me. We didn't even catch the first of it, but we'll play the full unedited
[24:16.000 --> 24:23.520]  clip in a moment yelling at me and calling me racist names. And then we'll play the full
[24:23.520 --> 24:30.800]  interaction, then we'll play now this news and others and the way they edited it deceptively
[24:30.800 --> 24:41.280]  engaged in fraud. Here it is. You're a colonizer. You're a racist. You're a racist. That's all.
[24:41.280 --> 24:47.880]  That's all. We've got it on video. So ladies, show some fans. Jones got you. That's right.
[24:47.880 --> 24:55.600]  That's right. Now here is the unedited interaction once we turned our cameras on about 30 seconds
[24:55.600 --> 25:00.000]  into her calling me a monkey. And you can hear calling me a monkey again and again and
[25:00.000 --> 25:04.240]  saying that my mother again married her brother and that I'm a pilgrim and need to leave. And
[25:04.240 --> 25:07.280]  I just pointed out that Native Americans weren't perfect angels either or killing each other.
[25:07.280 --> 25:10.880]  I'm part Native American, but I didn't play that carb with that lady or that my sister's
[25:10.880 --> 25:14.440]  Korean adopter or any of that. No, no, no, I'm a white guy. I'm bad. I get it. She's
[25:14.440 --> 25:19.320]  literally Brown KKK, in my opinion. That's what she's acting like. Here it is. See how
[25:19.320 --> 25:23.280]  I told you that was a bait switch? See how they bait switch this?
[25:23.280 --> 25:27.080]  He's banned from all social media for his right wing.
[25:27.080 --> 25:30.680]  There you go. This is another fascist leftist who wants my speech banned.
[25:30.680 --> 25:31.880]  I'm from here.
[25:31.880 --> 25:36.720]  And look, she's shredding around arrogantly saying it's good that people are getting banned.
[25:36.720 --> 25:38.480]  So you don't support the First Amendment, do you?
[25:38.480 --> 25:40.280]  I support everything. I serve this country.
[25:40.280 --> 25:45.120]  Well, you just got really, you just got, what did you do? You just got really excited about
[25:45.120 --> 25:47.120]  going, oh, he got banned on the bunch of stuff.
[25:47.120 --> 25:49.120]  I heard to be that salty.
[25:49.120 --> 25:52.120]  I'm telling you, our audience is double.
[25:52.120 --> 25:57.640]  I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you just a hateful, mindless
[25:57.640 --> 26:00.120]  left. I'm really full sorry for you, lady.
[26:00.120 --> 26:01.120]  I consider that okay.
[26:01.120 --> 26:07.120]  I understand you have existential envy because, you know, you don't feel like you're a colonizer.
[26:07.120 --> 26:08.120]  You're a colonizer.
[26:08.120 --> 26:09.120]  Yeah, right. You're racist.
[26:09.120 --> 26:11.120]  You're racist. What do you want as a racist?
[26:11.120 --> 26:14.520]  Oh, what? You came across the Bering Strait and then all the Native Americans did was
[26:14.520 --> 26:16.120]  kill each other for thousands of years.
[26:16.120 --> 26:17.120]  Prove that.
[26:17.120 --> 26:22.800]  Yeah, prove that. Oh, I guess it's all just garbage. Hey, the Bering Strait is so bad.
[26:22.800 --> 26:28.560]  By the way, those women look like they might be a quarter Native American.
[26:28.560 --> 26:31.280]  I know I have a lot of family that's more Native American than I am and grandparents
[26:31.280 --> 26:34.920]  and stuff that were, you know, my grandfather was as brown as these ladies.
[26:34.920 --> 26:39.440]  He's a hell of a little bit better looking though. He was, you know, Comanche background.
[26:39.440 --> 26:41.440]  Those are the best looking Indians there are. So I'm glad to have a little bit of that.
[26:41.440 --> 26:42.440]  I'm proud of it.
[26:42.440 --> 26:47.720]  But the point is, Lords of the Plains, these folks look more like they got some Aztec background
[26:47.720 --> 26:48.720]  to me, which is fine.
[26:48.720 --> 26:52.440]  And then they're mainly Spanish who were the original colonizers.
[26:52.440 --> 26:54.920]  So she's telling me that has ancestors that were colonizers.
[26:54.920 --> 26:55.920]  I'm a colonizer.
[26:55.920 --> 27:01.040]  Lady, 100%, I bet her a $10,000 if she goes and takes a genetic test that she's Castilian
[27:01.040 --> 27:05.360]  Spanish, probably half and then probably part African because the Africans took over Spain
[27:05.360 --> 27:06.360]  for a while.
[27:06.360 --> 27:07.840]  She doesn't know any of this.
[27:07.840 --> 27:12.200]  You've got this literal Castilian pointing her finger at me saying, I'm a colonizer when
[27:12.200 --> 27:17.160]  they're the original colonizers and I wouldn't be ashamed of how Spanish, Spanish liberated.
[27:17.160 --> 27:20.440]  Let me tell you the Aztecs, boy, they were in hell on earth.
[27:20.440 --> 27:21.440]  Let's go back to it.
[27:21.440 --> 27:22.440]  What did your balance?
[27:22.440 --> 27:23.440]  Why don't you go to Venezuela?
[27:23.440 --> 27:24.440]  Why don't you go to Venezuela?
[27:24.440 --> 27:25.440]  Why don't you go to Venezuela?
[27:25.440 --> 27:26.440]  Why don't you go to Venezuela?
[27:26.440 --> 27:27.440]  Why don't you go to Venezuela?
[27:27.440 --> 27:28.440]  Why don't you go to Venezuela?
[27:28.440 --> 27:29.440]  Why don't you go to Venezuela?
[27:29.440 --> 27:33.640]  You're a racist.
[27:33.640 --> 27:39.140]  That's all Van Jones teaches.
[27:39.140 --> 27:41.880]  That's all Van Jones teaches is you guys racist.
[27:41.880 --> 27:42.800]  You're Brown KKK.
[27:42.800 --> 27:43.800]  Yes.
[27:43.800 --> 27:44.800]  Brown KKK.
[27:44.800 --> 27:48.200]  Brown KKK, go away.
[27:48.200 --> 27:50.140]  Brown KKK, go away.
[27:50.140 --> 27:52.440]  Brown KKK, go away.
[27:52.440 --> 27:54.320]  Brown KKK, go away.
[27:54.320 --> 27:56.320]  Brown KKK, go away.
[27:56.320 --> 27:57.800]  Brown KKK, give me a hand.
[28:27.800 --> 28:30.680]  And then she just goes on.
[28:30.680 --> 28:31.680]  She called me some monkeys some more.
[28:31.680 --> 28:32.680]  Go ahead and play this.
[28:32.680 --> 28:33.680]  Round, take your cake.
[28:33.680 --> 28:34.680]  Round, take your cake.
[28:34.680 --> 28:35.680]  Go away.
[28:35.680 --> 28:36.680]  Round, take your cake.
[28:36.680 --> 28:37.680]  Go away.
[28:37.680 --> 28:38.680]  There you go.
[28:38.680 --> 28:39.680]  No.
[28:39.680 --> 28:40.680]  Round, take your cake.
[28:40.680 --> 28:41.680]  Go away.
[28:41.680 --> 28:42.680]  They're just like the Klan.
[28:42.680 --> 28:43.680]  They're just round.
[28:43.680 --> 28:44.680]  Round, take your cake.
[28:44.680 --> 28:45.680]  Go away.
[28:45.680 --> 28:46.680]  Say some more racist stuff.
[28:46.680 --> 28:50.120]  Now the media then said, we're going to come back with the rest of this.
[28:50.120 --> 28:53.400]  Oh, my mom and my dad, our brother and sister, we're going to come back and then show how
[28:53.400 --> 28:57.760]  the media edited it to lie to you and defraud you because they are the enemy of the American
[28:57.760 --> 28:58.760]  people.
[28:58.760 --> 28:59.760]  Stay with us.
[28:59.760 --> 29:02.520]  You've heard the phrase, you are what you eat, not true.
[29:02.520 --> 29:04.520]  Actually, you are what you can't absorb.
[29:04.520 --> 29:08.040]  So if the vitamins and supplements you now take are not being absorbed, what good are
[29:08.040 --> 29:09.040]  they?

[29:29.000 --> 29:30.000]  Hear that?
[29:30.000 --> 29:36.400]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place.
[29:36.400 --> 29:39.360]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.

[31:59.880 --> 32:00.880]  We knew it was coming.
[32:00.880 --> 32:02.840]  The whole thing was for me, Lake.
[32:02.840 --> 32:08.120]  First demonize info wars, lie about us, build a strawman, then sue us to add credibility
[32:08.120 --> 32:13.440]  to that, then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying
[32:13.440 --> 32:19.840]  children and Islamophobia, and then voila, two weeks later ban info wars completely
[32:19.840 --> 32:26.520]  off of dozens of major platforms where we were all in the top five or top 10 news feeds.
[32:26.520 --> 32:32.120]  Go to infowarslife.com, the fourth slash show, subscribe to the free podcast, just click

[32:51.000 --> 32:55.640]  free Android and iPhone apps, how they can then reach out to others with the information
[32:55.640 --> 33:04.120]  and point out, this is the verboten info, this is what they don't want you to see.
[33:04.120 --> 33:21.800]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:21.800 --> 33:48.840]  So Alex Jones here back live, thanks for joining us on this September 11th, 17th year anniversary.
[33:48.840 --> 33:53.960]  Right now we're looking into the incredible deception of corporate media because I just
[33:53.960 --> 33:59.040]  picked one of the news channels that deceptively edited this.
[33:59.040 --> 34:04.120]  This was put up by the media matters crowd, they give the orders, and then the media then
[34:04.120 --> 34:06.040]  picks up the lie.
[34:06.040 --> 34:10.720]  They edit the tapes, they put them out, then those all get picked up by everybody, and
[34:10.720 --> 34:13.720]  mainstream media all works in unison and then lie.
[34:13.720 --> 34:17.840]  As you've just seen with me being banned on Twitter, or Facebook, or Google, or off the
[34:17.840 --> 34:24.160]  Apple app last week, all of them published hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of articles
[34:24.160 --> 34:29.320]  at 447 with the Twitter ban, five hours after they decided to ban me, they got their story
[34:29.320 --> 34:33.720]  together, they lied, they took me down.
[34:33.720 --> 34:37.600]  And it's the same thing with every one of these, oh, did you hear Alex Jones bullied
[34:37.600 --> 34:42.240]  some poor Native American women, they don't want their names known because they're afraid
[34:42.240 --> 34:47.000]  of retaliation, he ran up and attacked them for no reason just on the street because they
[34:47.000 --> 34:53.920]  were Natives, and it was a horrible KKK event, and they play sad music, I'm gonna play the
[34:53.920 --> 35:00.520]  piece in a minute, they just, meanwhile they're screaming, hey you white monkey, I'm like,
[35:00.520 --> 35:07.600]  whoa, turn your cameras on, hey pilgrim get out of here, he got banned because he's hateful,
[35:07.600 --> 35:16.640]  get rid of him, your mother married her brother, you white monkey, and I'm like, whoa, you're
[35:16.640 --> 35:22.120]  racist, you're brown KKK, I don't like the KKK or you, get away from me KKK, and that's
[35:22.120 --> 35:25.600]  some crazy white women run over and say I was a Nazi too, that video's coming up, because
[35:25.600 --> 35:30.480]  I'm being confronted out there by these people, they're all stumbling around, sticking their
[35:30.480 --> 35:36.080]  chest up to me, hey white, white man, total racist garbage, meanwhile these women look
[35:36.080 --> 35:44.240]  like maybe they're 25% Native American, maybe, I mean their Spanish background, the original
[35:44.240 --> 35:49.880]  colonizers, it's lunatic land, but they act like it's some royalty, that oh, I'm Native
[35:49.880 --> 35:59.320]  American, oh, truly incredible, you got this lady, you know, she looks like she's from
[35:59.320 --> 36:03.760]  North Africa, but you get a lot, I mean I'm into, you know, to genetics, they're interesting,
[36:03.760 --> 36:08.120]  a lot of folks in Spain, half of Spain got taken over for a couple hundred years by the
[36:08.120 --> 36:14.440]  Muslims, and the Moors, and they were a mix of Asian and white and African, that's what
[36:14.440 --> 36:18.400]  Arabic basically that whole area is in North Africa, and so these folks don't even know
[36:18.400 --> 36:24.160]  their genetic background, I mean you're part black, you're part really Germanic, the tribes
[36:24.160 --> 36:30.040]  in Spain were more Germanic than Gaulish, if you actually knew that before the invasion
[36:30.040 --> 36:34.040]  they were blonde-haired blue-eyed, just like the Romans, Romans didn't have dark hair until
[36:34.040 --> 36:40.360]  they got invaded by the Moors as well, so, oh yeah, two thousand years ago, Romans looked
[36:40.360 --> 36:46.560]  like me, if you look at pictures of Julius Caesar, it looks about like me, so that's
[36:46.560 --> 36:52.080]  the reality here, and look, the whole point is lady, you've got colonizer in you, and
[36:52.080 --> 36:56.240]  the Native Americans were always running around killing each other, they were more warlike
[36:56.240 --> 36:59.840]  than you could imagine, and everybody was warlike, the Scots were always killing each
[36:59.840 --> 37:02.800]  other, and the Irish were always killing each other, and the Brits were always killing
[37:02.800 --> 37:07.640]  each other until they got big populations and they killed other tribes, that's a normal
[37:07.640 --> 37:17.760]  thing, so, just like they recognize conquest, all over the world in Africa, every African
[37:17.760 --> 37:21.920]  tribe recognizes the right of conquest, if you can take somebody's land by force, it's
[37:21.920 --> 37:31.360]  yours, and so this whole thing of like, oh we were mean to the natives, oh yeah, oh, when
[37:31.360 --> 37:36.800]  we got here, and I had family on both sides on the Mayflower, right at the tap of the
[37:36.800 --> 37:47.560]  Mayflower holding on yards, mile-standish, and when they got here trying to have religious
[37:47.560 --> 37:51.280]  freedom, the Native Americans came to them and they said, you're going to help us take
[37:51.280 --> 37:56.480]  over the next tribe, we're going to kill you ass, because those tribes all had beasts
[37:56.480 --> 37:59.880]  like crypts and bloods with each other, but again, that's the real history, and among
[37:59.880 --> 38:03.360]  the same natives were bad, that's just, go see the movie Revenant, if you want to know
[38:03.360 --> 38:08.160]  how the Native Americans operated, some groups were really, really nice, some groups will
[38:08.160 --> 38:14.000]  kill you for no reason, it's just like any other group of people, and it depended on
[38:14.000 --> 38:17.600]  if they knew you'd been attacked by one group, they suddenly liked you, but if they thought
[38:17.600 --> 38:25.120]  you'd attacked their group, you're dead in a hammer, very accurate, but I'm digressing,
[38:25.120 --> 38:33.360]  ladies and gentlemen, so these women run up to me and they do this, and then the news
[38:33.360 --> 38:37.360]  takes it and says that I was being racist and mean to Native American women, they came
[38:37.360 --> 38:41.120]  and got in my face, they called me a bunch of racial names, I just said, you're brown
[38:41.120 --> 38:48.240]  KKK, which is what Meshola Razi is, now these women aren't in that, I'll eat my hat, it's
[38:48.240 --> 38:55.240]  sick, so let's go ahead and finish up the clip, here it is, brown KKK, brown KKK, go
[38:55.240 --> 39:01.000]  away, brown KKK, there you go, no, brown KKK, go away, they're just like the Klan, they're
[39:01.000 --> 39:06.000]  just brown, brown KKK, go away, say some more racist stuff, ladies, show us what Van Jones
[39:06.000 --> 39:08.960]  taught you, brown KKK, brother and sister, that's right, that's right, my mom and dad
[39:08.960 --> 39:15.680]  are brother and sister, well, brown KKK, go away, I know I like my 150 IQ, lady, brown
[39:15.680 --> 39:24.000]  KKK, go away, brown KKK, go away, brown KKK, go away, brown KKK, go away, brown KKK, go
[39:24.000 --> 39:30.960]  away, so there you go, and then more ladies ran over five minutes later and got in my
[39:30.960 --> 39:34.200]  face saying I was a Nazi, and when I dared talk back to them, they went, oh, you're being
[39:34.200 --> 39:41.320]  mean to me, that's their operating system, now let's go to now this news network piece,
[39:41.320 --> 39:46.280]  they did with sad music in the background, and I'll read the text for radio listeners,
[39:46.280 --> 39:52.280]  here it is, that was Jones verbally abused his Native American women, by calling him
[39:52.280 --> 40:00.200]  brown KKK, brown KKK, go away, brown KKK, go away, brown KKK, go away, brown KKK, go away,
[40:00.200 --> 40:10.680]  now they cut to other shots of my own video, and then loop audio to deceive you, continue,
[40:10.680 --> 40:14.280]  the group of Native Americans who wish for men anonymous, travel to DC to attend the
[40:14.280 --> 40:20.680]  hearing of Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, and call attention to what they say is his
[40:20.680 --> 40:28.880]  poor record, of treatment of Native Americans, one of the women says she saw Jones confrontations
[40:28.880 --> 40:34.600]  with Senator Marco Rubio, and she brought up that Jones was kicked off various social
[40:34.600 --> 40:39.680]  media platforms, that's when she says he went off on her.
[40:39.680 --> 40:54.320]  So now it sounds like I'm a veteran, I love America, and then they cut, cut, cut, cut her,
[40:54.320 --> 40:59.520]  call me a monkey, attack my mother, my father, call me an inbred white person, go back to
[40:59.520 --> 41:03.160]  Europe, all edited, I'm just a veteran, you're being so mean, continue.
[41:03.160 --> 41:13.760]  You came across the Bering Strait, and then all the Native Americans did was kill each
[41:13.760 --> 41:19.640]  other for thousands of years, prove that, prove that, oh I guess, it's all just garbage,
[41:19.640 --> 41:24.640]  hey, if America is so bad, why does everybody want to come here, why don't you go to Venezuela,
[41:24.640 --> 41:30.440]  why don't you go to Venezuela with nothing but wonderful indigenous people, oh yeah go
[41:30.440 --> 41:38.520]  back home, blah, blah, blah, you picked a fight with a wrong woman, Jones's website
[41:38.520 --> 41:45.360]  and forums were recently suspended by Twitter, oh this is the sad music, they're such good
[41:45.360 --> 41:49.600]  liberals, you need to stand up to people like Alex Jones especially when they master hate
[41:49.600 --> 41:54.920]  speech, and right behind the First Amendment, women's statement, now this, Jones needs to
[41:54.920 --> 41:58.720]  take off his racist glasses and recognize that all brown people come from all different
[41:58.720 --> 42:03.560]  walks of life, women's statement, oh those poor people, they're like, ah we hate white
[42:03.560 --> 42:09.760]  people, you're in bread scum monkey, KKK style rhetoric, KKK would say about a black person
[42:09.760 --> 42:15.400]  about me, but they all, they knowingly edited all that to take it out to deceive and defraud
[42:15.400 --> 42:17.920]  you.
[42:17.920 --> 42:20.360]  Coming up, Media Matters has edited a bunch of statements I've made to make it sound like
[42:20.360 --> 42:24.240]  I'm being violent, to attack Dana Loche that defended me, or Dana Lash, that's all coming
[42:24.240 --> 42:28.200]  up, but first the amazing economic numbers with the head of the President's Council,

[47:12.160 --> 47:33.240]  We're in a war, we're in an information war, and we're all in it together, and I need
[47:33.240 --> 47:38.120]  your help because Infowars has been silenced off of every big tech platform so that mainstream
[47:38.120 --> 47:44.480]  corporate media can lynch me electronically so that they can have the number one propaganda
[47:44.480 --> 47:51.600]  outfit working with Facebook produced by Snapchat, now this, and others daily put out huge hoax
[47:51.600 --> 47:57.880]  lies about me to be pushed to the audiences there.
[47:57.880 --> 48:06.480]  And if you just tuned in, we broke down where these racist Hispanic ladies run over to me
[48:06.480 --> 48:15.880]  to get in my face and say that I am a subhuman, inbred, white, cave dweller, just like the
[48:15.880 --> 48:20.400]  New York Times writer says, and that my parents are inbred scum, and that I'm a monkey, and
[48:20.400 --> 48:23.000]  I say, how dare you racist?
[48:23.000 --> 48:32.020]  And so now this, in Facebook, edited it, put it out to defame me, to legitimize their banning
[48:32.020 --> 48:37.280]  of Infowars, and now every other major conservative we know in the major election meddling.
[48:37.280 --> 48:41.800]  The presidents get ready to take action with executive orders, it's time all of us take
[48:41.800 --> 48:46.920]  action by getting this video out to folks so they see the truth of these horrible, horrible
[48:46.920 --> 48:53.200]  racists that were funded clearly at these hearings by Soros, so many people that were
[48:53.200 --> 48:57.800]  there attacking us, not just these women, to go attack Kavanaugh, myself, you name it,
[48:57.800 --> 49:03.200]  and then they edit it and they lie, just, is there any justice in the universe against
[49:03.200 --> 49:08.640]  organizations like NowThisNews, who's allowed to be on Facebook and everywhere else, but
[49:08.640 --> 49:13.280]  I'm silenced there, so I can't respond, well they can't stop you getting this video, or
[49:13.280 --> 49:17.120]  they can't stop you getting the raw videos and pointing out the lies, we have to stand
[49:17.120 --> 49:20.760]  up against these people, they're authoritarians.
[49:20.760 --> 49:30.120]  Now the good news is, people are waking up, and what I'm about to show you is so powerful,
[49:30.120 --> 49:34.840]  the full videos on infowars.com, an article, White House Economist proves Trump reversed
[49:34.840 --> 49:41.360]  Obama's disastrous economic policies, and on the election day of November 8th, everything
[49:41.360 --> 49:47.680]  goes straight up in all these graphs, because they'd artificially under globalism set it
[49:47.680 --> 49:53.760]  up to drive down the U.S. economy and transfer our wealth under UN Treaty, and so Chairman
[49:53.760 --> 49:58.600]  of the Council of Economic Advisers, Kevin Hassett, sets the record straight.
[49:58.600 --> 50:03.360]  This is powerful for TV viewers, radio listeners, again, they have a red line on the election
[50:03.360 --> 50:08.400]  day, and people knowing America's open for business, under treaty it wasn't, we've been
[50:08.400 --> 50:12.280]  strategically sabotaged, and so that's why every graph goes straight up.
[50:12.280 --> 50:18.360]  Here is the report.
[50:18.360 --> 50:22.360]  We decided that this is a testable hypothesis, and so that what we can do is we can go out
[50:22.360 --> 50:27.880]  and we can estimate recent trends, that is, trends that ran in the economy up to the point
[50:27.880 --> 50:32.800]  of the last election, and then compare the latest data to the recent trends.
[50:32.800 --> 50:36.240]  In most cases, by the way, the estimates of the trends that we present to you here are
[50:36.240 --> 50:40.120]  very statistically significant, as are the deviations from the trend.
[50:40.120 --> 50:45.160]  And so, as I always do show you a few slides, can I have the next slide please?
[50:45.160 --> 50:48.000]  That's the first slide again, there we go.
[50:48.000 --> 50:53.320]  So the first slide that we're looking at is small business optimism, and this is basically
[50:53.320 --> 50:56.200]  for parallel construction, you're going to see that each of the slides we go through
[50:56.200 --> 51:01.760]  is going to look a lot like this, and so the blue part to the left of the slide is what
[51:01.760 --> 51:09.480]  happened from the 2012 election through the 2016 election, and the dotted blue line is
[51:09.480 --> 51:14.480]  the trend that President Trump inherited from the previous president, and the red line is
[51:14.480 --> 51:16.920]  what actually happened with the data.
[51:16.920 --> 51:20.480]  And so I think that if you look at this chart, you can see that the first thing is small
[51:20.480 --> 51:25.880]  business optimism, the middle chart is the percent reporting now is a good time to expand,
[51:25.880 --> 51:30.160]  the last one is the percent expecting higher real sales in six months, I think if you
[51:30.160 --> 51:34.240]  look at any of those, you'd say, geez, that doesn't really look like the continuation
[51:34.240 --> 51:35.240]  of a recent trend.
[51:35.240 --> 51:39.240]  Good, I have the next slide please.
[51:39.240 --> 51:44.680]  The next chart is something that in my first presser here way back last fall, we talked
[51:44.680 --> 51:50.720]  a lot about, it's business investment, which is more than $300 billion over the trend.
[51:50.720 --> 51:55.240]  Again, if you look at the blue line on the left, the first chart is non-residential fixed
[51:55.240 --> 51:59.880]  investment, and the dotted line is the trend and the growth rate of that that President
[51:59.880 --> 52:06.960]  Trump inherited for the middle chart is structures or buildings, and that, as you can see, the
[52:06.960 --> 52:09.480]  dotted line is something that's headed straight down.
[52:09.480 --> 52:13.880]  And then the final chart is equipment investment, and that went straight down before President
[52:13.880 --> 52:15.280]  Trump was elected.
[52:15.280 --> 52:20.080]  And I think that if anyone were to assert that the capital spending boom that we're
[52:20.080 --> 52:25.720]  seeing right now was a continuation of the trend that President Trump inherited, then
[52:25.720 --> 52:30.160]  well, you know, they wouldn't get a high grade in graduate school for that assertion.
[52:30.160 --> 52:35.960]  The next chart please, durable goods orders, capital goods orders, it's a key part of
[52:35.960 --> 52:40.760]  the economy, and it's one of the factors that we look at most closely because it characterizes
[52:40.760 --> 52:44.000]  basically the good paying jobs, the jobs.
[52:44.000 --> 52:45.960]  I want to pause right here.
[52:45.960 --> 52:47.640]  If you're a radio listener, that's wonderful.
[52:47.640 --> 52:50.600]  Please tell everybody about the local station you're listening to.
[52:50.600 --> 52:54.000]  Everyone has to go to infowars.com.
[52:54.000 --> 52:58.560]  I've been kicked off everything except our hundreds of radio stations and TV stations,
[52:58.560 --> 53:02.800]  and we're literally getting five, six great stations a week right now.
[53:02.800 --> 53:04.040]  Big ones.
[53:04.040 --> 53:07.160]  About to cut liners for 20-something stations we got the last two weeks.
[53:07.160 --> 53:09.480]  They've just got to send us the exact liners they want.
[53:09.480 --> 53:18.800]  We're on huge stations in Fresno, California, and some of the California ones, and their
[53:18.800 --> 53:21.880]  capital as well.
[53:21.880 --> 53:26.640]  So a lot of amazing things, Sacramento, you name it, it's all over the country.
[53:26.640 --> 53:30.440]  The biggest stations are picking us up now because they get what's happening.
[53:30.440 --> 53:34.920]  So this is blowing up with the globalist face to a great extent.
[53:34.920 --> 53:38.880]  But just like they want to sabotage the economy, and just like Bill Marsh says he wants a depression
[53:38.880 --> 53:42.760]  to teach people that Trump's bad, it's still a war.
[53:42.760 --> 53:47.320]  And so if you're a radio listener, you've got to go to infowars.com to see this nine-minute
[53:47.320 --> 53:48.320]  video with the graphs.
[53:48.320 --> 53:56.080]  I mean, you see a jump of about seven, eight percent when he's president-elect.
[53:56.080 --> 53:57.520]  Just, wow, okay.
[53:57.520 --> 54:00.320]  And then as soon as he gets in and starts delivering, it goes straight up.
[54:00.320 --> 54:06.400]  So every graph goes, bloop, bloop, boom, bloop, bloop, boom, bloop, bloop, boom, and it kind
[54:06.400 --> 54:09.720]  of goes up and then down a little because people thought he wasn't going to get inaugurated
[54:09.720 --> 54:10.720]  because the Democrats said he wouldn't.
[54:10.720 --> 54:18.160]  So it goes, bloop, down some, and then, boom, bloop, bloop, boom, bloop, bloop, boom.
[54:18.160 --> 54:20.120]  I mean, you've got to see this as a radio listener.
[54:20.120 --> 54:24.960]  This is so important, and then Obama gets out there and lies and takes credit for all
[54:24.960 --> 54:25.960]  of it.
[54:25.960 --> 54:26.960]  It is insane.
[54:26.960 --> 54:31.560]  I mean, I looked at all the graphs and basically drew this out.
[54:31.560 --> 54:36.880]  This is Obama going straight down, boom, Trump gets elected, some of the things are
[54:36.880 --> 54:46.080]  like, straight up, straight up because America was being held under.
[54:46.080 --> 54:49.560]  What did I tell you it's in the UNESCO documents?
[54:49.560 --> 54:54.160]  He hasn't even gotten 10% control yet and they can't even hold America down.
[54:54.160 --> 54:56.760]  If you're holding America, you think the spirit of America wanted to be held down by these
[54:56.760 --> 54:57.760]  jerks?
[54:57.760 --> 54:58.760]  No.
[54:58.760 --> 55:05.560]  And just getting them off us a little, straight up, let's go back to the video.
[55:05.560 --> 55:09.160]  Durable goods orders, capital goods orders, it's a key part of the economy and it's one
[55:09.160 --> 55:14.360]  of the factors that we look at most closely because it characterizes basically the good
[55:14.360 --> 55:20.440]  paying jobs, the jobs that affects normal Americans, blue-collar Americans.
[55:20.440 --> 55:25.200]  And the first chart is core capital goods orders and the second chart is core capital
[55:25.200 --> 55:26.920]  goods shipments.
[55:26.920 --> 55:32.280]  And if you look at it, the blue again shows a clear downward trajectory in billions of
[55:32.280 --> 55:38.000]  dollars and that trajectory reversed itself completely when President Trump was elected.
[55:38.000 --> 55:39.000]  If you were going to assert-
[55:39.000 --> 55:45.280]  Hit pause back in 20 seconds, this is why I get so angry.
[55:45.280 --> 55:49.800]  Obama was artificially suppressing the economy and people go, oh wait, the Federal Reserve
[55:49.800 --> 55:54.880]  printed $5.5 trillion for him, none for Trump and they've done six interest rates to try
[55:54.880 --> 56:01.200]  to stop Trump because that $5.5 trillion did not go to the American people.
[56:01.200 --> 56:06.240]  The big banks had 0% lending to themselves but they had record interest rates for real
[56:06.240 --> 56:11.440]  lending for like things like credit cards and they got rid of loan sharking laws all
[56:11.440 --> 56:14.400]  over the country so you could have payday loans.
[56:14.400 --> 56:20.840]  The globalists were giving themselves trillions of dollars for Chinese investment and Trump's
[56:20.840 --> 56:26.000]  looking at this going, uh-uh, no, you let me in, I'll untie the boat from the dock.
[56:26.000 --> 56:29.480]  You ever pulled out when you're getting gas, I got a boat, anybody got a boat and you're
[56:29.480 --> 56:33.200]  trying to pull out and whoa, almost pulled the dock off, let me, oh, I forgot a rope,
[56:33.200 --> 56:38.480]  hey, why didn't you untie that rope, son, tell my son, untie the rope, son, we're leaving,
[56:38.480 --> 56:44.280]  son, did you see the rope, Trump just went, untie the rope, we're gonna come back and
[56:44.280 --> 56:49.720]  play the rest of it, it's just amazing, ladies and gentlemen, that we're going straight down
[56:49.720 --> 56:57.880]  and now we go straight up and then Obama has the nerve saying we never get to 3%, it's
[56:57.880 --> 57:01.320]  impossible, in fact, I have the Krogman Club, I keep my hand to play, can you guys go grab
[57:01.320 --> 57:05.760]  that where he said it's impossible, he said there's no way to go above 3%, we have the
[57:05.760 --> 57:13.040]  video and then now Krogman's taking credit himself, he said it's impossible and that's
[57:13.040 --> 57:18.800]  Obama's main economic advisor and now Obama swagger's around going, huh, it was as good
[57:18.800 --> 57:25.280]  under me as it is now and it's all because of me, you are a liar, we're in economic war,
[57:25.280 --> 57:28.160]  Amazon's banning books, they're coming after our shopping carts, they're trying to shut
[57:28.160 --> 57:31.560]  us down, we're running out of x2, we can't get the supplies of it anymore, we got the

[59:47.120 --> 59:53.560]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning.
[59:53.560 --> 01:00:18.840]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:25.480]  So we have the chairman of the economic council of advisors, Kevin Hassett, in a nine minute
[01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:31.240]  video we're going to finish up right now destroying Obama's lives, I mean the White
[01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:38.480]  House economist destroys with these graphs Obama's lies taking credit for the economic
[01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:44.080]  recovery which again, they had shut down the general economy, shut down real factories,
[01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:50.080]  shut down real local corporations and real local power and only had insider big banks,
[01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:55.200]  insider big operations getting the trillions of U.S. taxpayer money that the Federal Reserve
[01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:59.160]  was putting out that we have to pay for to transfer wealth to China.
[01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:01.560]  It's a military operation.
[01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:04.840]  Trump came in and said we're out of TPP, we're not putting up with China anymore, we're
[01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:09.000]  bringing investment back here, it's over and that's why they're flipping out because we
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000]  were taken over by economic warfare.
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.000]  Let's continue.
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:16.360]  Capital goods orders, capital goods orders, it's a key part of the economy and it's one
[01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:21.560]  of the factors that we look at most closely because it characterizes basically the good
[01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:27.640]  paying jobs, the jobs that affects normal Americans, blue collar Americans.
[01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:32.400]  And the first chart is core capital goods orders and the second chart is core capital
[01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:38.600]  goods shipments and if you look at it the blue again shows a clear downward trajectory
[01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:44.280]  in billions of dollars and then that trajectory reversed itself completely when President
[01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:45.280]  Trump was elected.
[01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:50.520]  If you were going to assert that the current good news is just the extension of a recent
[01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:55.440]  trend then you'd just simply be factually incorrect.
[01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:57.680]  The next chart slide please.
[01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:05.680]  Here we're looking at the ISM Purchasing Managers Index which is a survey of people who are
[01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:11.520]  purchasing managers for manufacturing firms and so there are the folks that as the title
[01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:16.360]  suggests manage the purchases and so it's a really great indicator of the economy because
[01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:20.040]  you could survey them and say hey have you been buying lots of stuff this month or have
[01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:26.160]  you not and the index shows what their responses look like and you can see that the trend on
[01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:31.240]  the purchasing managers index was pretty much flat when President Trump took office
[01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:37.560]  and the red line shows you what happened since that there's a clear inflection right at the
[01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:42.360]  election and a clear break from the trend.
[01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:44.240]  Let's turn to the next one please.
[01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:47.920]  Now one of the things that I remember at the American Enterprise Institute talking a lot
[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:53.880]  about before I came in here was the fact that entrepreneurship in America was falling off
[01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:58.880]  and one of the ways we can measure entrepreneurship is that if you start a new business that you
[01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:05.640]  have to apply for an ID number, tax ID number for your business and so in this chart we've
[01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:12.040]  plotted the EIN applications for new businesses and if you look at the blue line they were
[01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:17.920]  heading up because we were at a recovery but there's a clear upward trajectory way above
[01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:25.800]  the trend at the end and Sarah like John Roberts is a calculus geek and so she looked
[01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:30.520]  at that one and said jeez that looks like a very strong second derivative to me and
[01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:33.800]  then I said I didn't know you did calculus since you said I like calculus better than
[01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:36.800]  talking to these guys.
[01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:41.800]  The next chart is prime age workers re-entering the labor force and again if you look at the
[01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:45.600]  trend one of the things people said when we put out our growth forecast that said that
[01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:50.760]  we'd have 3% growth was we said that President Trump's policies are going to bring factories
[01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:55.280]  back to the US, give you the capital spending boom that you saw in the previous chart and
[01:03:55.280 --> 01:04:00.240]  that was going to bring people back into the labor force at precisely the right time.
[01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:06.720]  Once again you can see that there's a clear break of the trend and so if you see a break
[01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:11.240]  of the trend in the capital spending the new plant formation that gives blue collar workers
[01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:16.840]  their jobs, go to the next slide please, then maybe we see a break of the trend in blue collar
[01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:21.960]  workers employment as well and so this is employment for people in goods producing industries.
[01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:26.040]  If you look again at the blue part on the left you can see that there's a clear downward
[01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:32.280]  trend going on in the growth rate of that for President Obama and then a clear inflection
[01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:38.280]  timed almost precisely once again at the election and the notion again that somebody might defensively
[01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:42.600]  attempt to assert that this is a continuation of a trend is almost laughable if you look
[01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:45.640]  at this chart and look at the rest of it.
[01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:46.640]  Now somebody might say-
[01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:51.440]  We'll be right back with the conclusion of this and then the latest on the hurricane
[01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:55.560]  that's pointed right at major nuclear reactors, ten of them.
[01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:58.440]  We'll look at all of that straight ahead.
[01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:02.600]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:06.720]  Info wars is proud to sell incredible filters but it's almost impossible to keep up with
[01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:09.720]  every faucet, shower and sink in your home.

[01:05:54.560 --> 01:06:04.080]  Pro Pure Whole House filtration system today.
[01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:31.080]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:40.080]  We are now 17 years after the tragic event that took 3,000 American lives, thousands
[01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:47.000]  more died from the deadly dust that Bush and the Democrats with him covered up.
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:50.240]  We've got Mike Adams joining us here in just a few minutes.
[01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:56.120]  The major regulatory agencies, Department of Energy and others are taking the 10 major
[01:06:56.120 --> 01:07:00.680]  plants are in the way of the new hurricane, we're going to be looking at all of that in
[01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:05.080]  the serious devastation of a cat six Florence set to make landfall the next few days.
[01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:06.080]  We pray it slows down.
[01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:08.640]  We're going to be looking at all that in a moment.
[01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:13.840]  But first, the economic 9-11, and I've been playing clips here of White House economists
[01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:19.720]  proves Trump reversed Obama's disastrous economic policies, Kevin Hassett, and he's
[01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:24.360]  just showing chart after chart of right when Trump gets elected, the economy starts going
[01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:25.360]  up.
[01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:28.160]  And the Democrats say, oh, we're not going to let him get in office, so it starts dropping,
[01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:31.360]  and as soon as he gets inaugurated, straight up.
[01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:33.640]  So we're going to go ahead and finish up with this important clip.
[01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:34.640]  Here it is.
[01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:43.120]  The final chart, you'll see that the black line is in June of 2017, what the CBO, a Congressional
[01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:47.560]  Budget Office, a nonpartisan agency that has a job really of looking at recent trends
[01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:53.160]  and projecting it, what they said would happen to capital spending back in 2017.
[01:07:53.160 --> 01:08:01.320]  The blue line is what they said in April 2018, and the red line is what's actually happened.
[01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:05.840]  And so I would assert that if you look at the collective body of evidence, the notion
[01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:10.560]  that what we're seeing right now is just a continuation of recent trends is not super
[01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:11.880]  defensible.
[01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:18.440]  And I think that I know that we're in a political time, and passions are high, but as Ikea
[01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:22.520]  economists, one of the things we have to do is think ahead to what historians will think
[01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:24.240]  when they look back at this time.
[01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:29.840]  And I can promise you that economic historians will 100% accept the fact that there was an
[01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:34.720]  inflection at the election of Donald Trump and that a whole bunch of data items started
[01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:36.280]  headed north.
[01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:41.160]  They will, of course, argue for a long time about why that happened.
[01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:46.360]  But my final thought for you is just this, that when they do that, and when you watch
[01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:51.160]  people do that in the media going forward with op-eds and so on, that you should watch
[01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:53.320]  out for ex-post theorizing.
[01:08:53.320 --> 01:08:56.840]  As an economist, one of the things I most care about is an ex-ante theory, something that
[01:08:56.840 --> 01:09:00.760]  happens before, and then let's watch the data and then see if it agrees with the theory.
[01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:02.100]  That's how you test the theory.
[01:09:02.100 --> 01:09:07.440]  You might recall that I came back here last fall, and I told you that if we had the tax
[01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:12.960]  cuts that President Trump advised that we had that he pursued, if we passed them, then
[01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:15.880]  there'd be a boom in capital spending this year.
[01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:21.080]  In fact, we provided estimates at the time last fall that said that capital spending,
[01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:26.040]  this year, would go up about 11% because of the tax cuts.
[01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:29.960]  So far in the first half of the year, capital spending is up 10%.
[01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:33.080]  And so you don't have to really reach far for a theory of what happened.
[01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:35.240]  President Trump deregulated the economy.
[01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:36.960]  We've talked about how that affects growth.
[01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:41.640]  The tax cuts have had exactly the predicted effect on the economy that's brought businesses
[01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:46.760]  back to the US, factories back to the US, and created jobs for ordinary Americans.
[01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:49.480]  It's clear in the data that there's been a trend break.
[01:09:49.480 --> 01:09:52.040]  So that is the good news.
[01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:56.800]  The trend break is artificially the globalists who are driving down the West, the industrializing
[01:09:56.800 --> 01:10:03.320]  us, shutting off our jobs and industry to authoritarian China to dominate the globe.
[01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:05.240]  And now we know that Google and Apple have moved to China.
[01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:09.240]  They won't even work with the Pentagon, but they'll work with the Chinese military.
[01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:14.640]  These are US companies started with US DARPA funding, and they're working against everybody.
[01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:20.360]  And now Amazon's banning books of conservatives, they are testing and probing.
[01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:25.240]  And I'm told from White House sources that Trump has a mutiny going on that's now admitted.
[01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:28.920]  We first told you about that a year ago, but that he's trying to get executive orders done
[01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:34.640]  right now against Google, against Facebook, against Twitter.
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:35.640]  You name it.
[01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:43.680]  But the ignorance of the senators in those hearings has only green-lighted the hubris
[01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:44.800]  we're seeing.
[01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:50.480]  And there's more news out today about internal emails of Google telling people to give illegal
[01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:56.320]  campaign contributions, how to get, you know, illegal aliens to vote, you name it, to go
[01:10:56.320 --> 01:11:00.560]  out and tell their employees, you better get your Hispanic folks to vote for Hillary.
[01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:04.040]  This is what they do, and they couldn't deliver the election like they thought, so now they're
[01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:06.640]  openly censoring to do it.
[01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:10.760]  The good news is with just Trump getting partial control of the government back and changing
[01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:13.440]  the policy that's anti-American, things are coming back.
[01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:15.560]  You can't hold back America.
[01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:19.000]  Even on our death bed, we've come back from the dead like the Phoenix.
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:24.400]  The bad news is we have a hurricane that they say is accelerating to a cat six.
[01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:29.600]  Hurricane Florence nears Carolinas, forcing westward exodus of millions of people.
[01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:33.480]  What happens in North Carolina is wild horses when a major hurricane like Florence hits.
[01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:37.200]  And it just goes on from there.
[01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:41.160]  Hurricane risk, including toxic sludge and lagoons of pigment are flowing out to the
[01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:42.160]  ocean.
[01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:45.520]  Millions prepare for potentially catastrophic Florence.
[01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:50.520]  Hurricane Florence could be the worst storm ever to hit North Carolina, north of Florida.
[01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:54.080]  And it just goes on from there.
[01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:58.440]  Expect 50 and 20 foot storm surge, but here's the big news.
[01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:03.800]  And there's a little blurb on this that was in several other publications, just where
[01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:08.800]  the federal government and the Department of Energy and others and the Nuclear Regulatory
[01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:11.680]  Commission had said that it could hit 10 power plants.
[01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:16.560]  Well, Mike Adams actually went to their website at naturalnews.com, reposting this at infowars.com
[01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:17.560]  as well.
[01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:22.760]  Fukushima in America, 12 nuclear power plants are in the path of Hurricane Florence, flooding,
[01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:26.000]  storm surge threatened, cooling operations.
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:29.600]  Could we have with our aging plants a Fukushima type scenario?
[01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:31.360]  I hope not.
[01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:32.760]  But this is a cat six.
[01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:37.440]  It could certainly direct hits plants, cause some problems and Mike Adams an engineer
[01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:38.440]  is here to break it down.
[01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:41.080]  Mike, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:42.760]  Thanks for having me on, Alex.
[01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:43.760]  And I agree with you.
[01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:46.400]  We pray that this scenario doesn't unfold.
[01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:51.360]  But we were promised by General Electric that it wouldn't happen in Fukushima.
[01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:55.680]  And it's also General Electric that built the exact same power plant, the Brunswick
[01:12:55.680 --> 01:12:56.680]  power plants.
[01:12:56.680 --> 01:13:00.400]  There's two units that are active right now that are right near the ocean.
[01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:05.400]  You can go to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission website and you can see their map,
[01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:06.960]  which we've published in the story there.
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:08.920]  You're welcome to use all those images.
[01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:14.000]  It shows the two operating live power plants right there that are what's called boiler
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.680]  water reactors or BWRs.
[01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:19.040]  They were built in the 1970s.
[01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:23.720]  And this is virtually identical to the same kind of structure that Fukushima power plants
[01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:24.720]  used.
[01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:29.640]  And if you recall Fukushima, what happened was that a storm surge from an underground
[01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:35.000]  earthquake caused a massive wave of ocean water to come in and inundate that power plant,
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:40.400]  which overwhelmed the diesel generators and the backup battery power supplies, which caused
[01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:42.920]  the cooling operations to fail.
[01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:44.960]  This led to a meltdown.
[01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:48.840]  And I will mention, by the way, you'll remember this, Alex, that the entire mainstream media
[01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:52.360]  at the time lied and said there wasn't a meltdown.
[01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:53.560]  They denied it for years.
[01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:55.800]  Now they report it as if everybody always knew it.
[01:13:55.800 --> 01:14:03.760]  I mean, talk about the lying media, but whatever, a meltdown scenario is a worst case scenario.
[01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:05.000]  We hope it doesn't happen.
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:11.200]  There's no, I can't say there's any evidence right now that the nuclear power facility operators
[01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:18.040]  are anticipating such an outcome, but we've learned from history that we are lied to constantly,
[01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:22.360]  including by nuclear power plant operators and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
[01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:23.800]  We're lied to about radiation levels.
[01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:25.440]  We're lied to about the meltdowns.
[01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:30.480]  So of course we have honest skepticism about the readiness of these power plants.
[01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:36.800]  Now granted, if this were to go into some kind of a radiological release scenario, if
[01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:42.640]  the power failed, if the cooling pumps failed, and if there were a meltdown, we're talking
[01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:45.960]  the highly populated east coast of the United States.
[01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:49.720]  And depending on wind patterns, there could be a radiological release theoretically.
[01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:53.240]  Well, we know the wind patterns are already north and with a hurricane it'll go straight
[01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:56.320]  up the east coast with a radioactive cloud.
[01:14:56.320 --> 01:15:01.040]  Right in Virginia, Washington, DC, New York City, and even as far as Boston, depending
[01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:02.040]  on wind conditions.
[01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:06.040]  And let's be clear, this general electric plant is a 40 year old design, a total piece
[01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:07.040]  of crap.
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:12.280]  It is, it is the surge of the tsunami coming in, they're saying 15 to 20 foot surges here
[01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:13.280]  coming in.
[01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:17.800]  And so if those swamp the generators and the electricity goes out and the generators, then
[01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:19.640]  it starts melting down.
[01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:23.920]  And we have back in the 50s had one meltdown in California, they covered up for 40 years.
[01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:27.960]  They didn't declassify that to what the early 1990s, that thing blew up as big as Fukushima.
[01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:31.960]  So that's my concern is these are rotting badly managed plants.
[01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:33.360]  And we're going to come back and talk about that.
[01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:38.080]  We're hoping this doesn't happen, but stories at naturalnews.com, Fukushima in America,
[01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:42.000]  12 nuclear power plants are in the path of hurricane Florence, flooding storm surge could
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:46.640]  threaten cooling operations, and hopefully putting attention on this will make the executives
[01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:50.080]  who are, you know, flying around on their jumbo jets or whatever, not be cheap like
[01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:57.840]  I did with the whole, you know, BP explosion out the ocean, get extra people there now.

[01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:01.280]  The whole thing was for me, leg.
[01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:06.520]  Just demonize InfoWars, lie about us, build a straw man, then sue us to add credibility
[01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:11.860]  to that, then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying
[01:19:11.860 --> 01:19:14.360]  children and Islamophobia.
[01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:21.000]  And then, voila, two weeks later ban InfoWars completely off of dozens of major platforms
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:24.880]  where we were all in the top five or top ten news feeds.
[01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:31.000]  Go to InfoWars.com, forward slash show, subscribe to the free podcast, just click on the link
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:32.000]  below.

[01:19:34.920 --> 01:19:39.080]  It's also critical to go to InfoWars.com, forward slash newsletter and give us your
[01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:43.320]  emails so that we can stay in contact with you and send you videos and articles on our
[01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:44.320]  own platform.
[01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:49.360]  But whatever you do, tell folks about InfoWars.com, forward slash show, how they can download
[01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:54.040]  the free Android and iPhone apps, how they can then reach out to others with the information
[01:19:54.040 --> 01:20:01.520]  to point out, this is the verboten info, this is what they don't want you to see.
[01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:29.800]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:37.840]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:42.840]  We know we've been knocked off most platforms 56 days out because the globalists are planning
[01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:44.200]  a coup against the president.
[01:20:44.200 --> 01:20:46.920]  They're on the news saying they want to remove him, 25th amendment.
[01:20:46.920 --> 01:20:51.880]  They've got sleeper cells, the New York Times says, that's a quote, inside the White House.
[01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:55.880]  We have that headline from InfoWars.com a year and a half ago.
[01:20:55.880 --> 01:20:58.160]  We've got so much to break down.
[01:20:58.160 --> 01:21:02.720]  I love science and I know if you run reactors right and really on top of it and build them
[01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:07.400]  in the right spot, it's a great power source, but it could still have problems.
[01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:10.520]  But you start building hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of these and they're not upkeeping
[01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:13.240]  them and they're not caring and letting them dilapidate.
[01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:19.520]  You get a chair noble, you get a Fukushima, you get a Shodium reactor experiment.
[01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:26.960]  And again, NBC News, 1959, it blew up as big as Fukushima, radiated California.
[01:21:26.960 --> 01:21:32.920]  They believe it may have caused up to a million cancers, there's even a Wikipedia on it.
[01:21:32.920 --> 01:21:37.560]  And we blame the Russians and I'm not a Russophile, I'm not a Russaphobe either.
[01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:39.840]  Oh, they kind of played down Fukushima.
[01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:44.440]  They admitted or chair noble, they admitted it happened, the Japanese played it down.
[01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:46.440]  The point is that's what they do.
[01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:51.240]  And I've seen international atomic energy agency numbers that 90 plus percent of reactors
[01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:52.880]  are leaking.
[01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:58.320]  The average age is like 41 years old now, so they should have been decommissioned in
[01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:00.120]  25 years.
[01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:05.960]  So Mike Adams is here to talk about this because this is a CAT-4 accelerating in most models,
[01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:11.360]  weather underground, weather channel, to a CAT-6 at landfall, raging into the interior
[01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:15.320]  up to 500 miles before it goes to CAT-3.
[01:22:15.320 --> 01:22:20.400]  But generally they turn up the coast and don't slow down much and go down to CAT-5.
[01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:25.640]  We're talking insane asylum surges of 15 to 20 feet.
[01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:31.840]  Those go in, knock out power, they go on diesel generators, but they don't have these generators
[01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:34.920]  on towers, just like Fukushima did.
[01:22:34.920 --> 01:22:40.760]  So that a 20 foot tsunami come in, that knocks out the generators.
[01:22:40.760 --> 01:22:42.560]  And then the meltdown begins.
[01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:46.840]  Mike Adams is an engineer, he's got the report on naturalnews.com, Fukushima in America,
[01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:50.480]  12 nuclear power plants are in the path of hurricane Florence, flooding, storm surge,
[01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:51.480]  threatened cooling operations.
[01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:54.480]  You're going right off the federal government's own numbers here.
[01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:57.360]  If media tries to say we're fear monitoring, we're not fear monitoring.
[01:22:57.360 --> 01:23:01.920]  We want an emergency declared now by the president, not just a normal emergency, but
[01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:06.840]  a specific emergency to put federal teams in, U.S. military, nuclear engineers.
[01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:09.280]  We need them swarming these 12 plants.
[01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:14.040]  Mike, you've got them all mapped out, your amazing in-depth 15-page article, you pound
[01:23:14.040 --> 01:23:15.720]  it out in just a few hours.
[01:23:15.720 --> 01:23:16.720]  Great job.
[01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:17.720]  Thanks for watching.
[01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:18.720]  It's infowars.com.
[01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:19.880]  Everybody's got to retweet this.
[01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:20.880]  It's so critical.
[01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:24.720]  Again, get it into the threat, and then what you think the solution is to this, because
[01:23:24.720 --> 01:23:27.200]  I don't want to just sit here and wait for another disaster.
[01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:28.960]  Well, let's talk about this.
[01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:34.000]  Let's talk straight science about this, because that's alarming enough as it is.
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:37.960]  So number one, the current projections show the hurricane being practically a direct
[01:23:37.960 --> 01:23:41.960]  hit on North Carolina, which includes this Brunswick power facility.
[01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:47.360]  This nuclear power facility, like most facilities, is located at a very low elevation, almost
[01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:51.640]  at sea level, because it has to use local water for cooling.
[01:23:51.640 --> 01:23:54.040]  So they always sit on lakes or rivers.
[01:23:54.040 --> 01:23:57.000]  They have to have all this excess water to run through and cool, and then they dump the
[01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.680]  excess heat into the river.
[01:23:59.680 --> 01:24:05.360]  In this case, it's the Cape Fear River that then empties into the Atlantic Ocean.
[01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:10.400]  So this nuclear power facility, the Brunswick facility, is close to the ocean, which means
[01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:17.280]  a storm surge, which is being predicted by the NOAA, could impact that facility.
[01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:21.520]  A storm surge is what caused Fukushima to go into a meltdown, and a storm surge is
[01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:22.920]  our concern here.
[01:24:22.920 --> 01:24:25.000]  We're not predicting that it will happen.
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:26.680]  We pray and hope it never happens.
[01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:32.720]  But we have a social responsibility here to put out a warning to local people that this
[01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:34.160]  is a possibility.
[01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:36.360]  And what happens in a meltdown is, of course-
[01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:40.560]  I want to stop you, they just showed a photo of the Brunswick facility, it looks just like
[01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:44.720]  Fukushima, I guess because it is the same design.
[01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:46.000]  It's almost the identical design.
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.560]  Again, they're all boiler water reactors.
[01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:53.480]  And these reactors depend on a steady supply of electricity to run the coolant pumps.
[01:24:53.480 --> 01:24:58.600]  If the electricity is cut off and the generators fail and the batteries fail, then you go
[01:24:58.600 --> 01:24:59.600]  into a meltdown.
[01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:03.400]  Because the physics of the situation is you can't just turn off fuel rods.
[01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:06.920]  There's no light switch to stop the physics of fission.
[01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:09.040]  These reactions continue to go on.
[01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:11.520]  I mean, we're talking physics and elements here.
[01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:13.720]  You can't just stop it because you hope it stops.
[01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:15.360]  And that's what happened in Fukushima.
[01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:19.760]  And if there is a meltdown, you're going to have a massive release of radioisotopes into
[01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:20.760]  the atmosphere.
[01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:23.800]  Now, there's a containment building, of course, in the United States.
[01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:26.600]  But what happened in Fukushima is there was an explosion.
[01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:31.000]  I believe it was a hydrogen explosion that destroyed much of the containment facility,
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:32.000]  allowing the radioisotope-
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:36.280]  In fact, they confirmed it through rods as far as three miles away.
[01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:37.280]  That's right.
[01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:38.280]  That's right.
[01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:41.080]  So in that case, you're going to be dealing with two isotopes in particular that are
[01:25:41.080 --> 01:25:42.360]  very hazardous.
[01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:46.040]  Number one is iodine-131, which is the most deadly.
[01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:49.960]  It has a very short half-life, so it irradiates quickly.
[01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:53.960]  It has a half-life of about eight days, or you could call it roughly one week.
[01:25:53.960 --> 01:25:54.960]  And remember-
[01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:57.120]  But by then, your thyroid is cooked dead.
[01:25:57.120 --> 01:25:58.120]  Absolutely.
[01:25:58.120 --> 01:26:02.200]  So if you're getting iodine-131 into your body, you're going to be, you know, depending
[01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:07.160]  on the amount of internal radiation exposure, you could easily die from that.
[01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:10.720]  People get it through consuming milk, water, and food.
[01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:11.720]  And remember that sea-
[01:26:11.720 --> 01:26:17.280]  Well, I'm sorry, iodine does go to the thyroid and other glands throughout the body, including
[01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:19.400]  a breast tissue and prostate tissue.
[01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:24.840]  So this is why the Nuclear Regulatory Commission itself advises people to have a supplementary
[01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:27.800]  iodine, a potassium iodide, on hand.
[01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:33.040]  And they have handed this out in the past in cities where residents are close to nuclear
[01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:34.680]  power facilities.
[01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:40.320]  And secondly, you have cesium-137, which has a half-life of about 29 or, well, 30 years,
[01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:41.440]  let's call it.
[01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:47.880]  And it takes 10 half-lives, Alex, 10 half-lives for these isotopes to go down to what are
[01:26:47.880 --> 01:26:49.560]  considered zero levels.
[01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:55.000]  So if iodine-131 has a half-life of, let's say, one week, it takes 10 weeks before it
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:59.840]  gets really good, so for 10 weeks, you are exposed to this.
[01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:01.720]  In week one, you get a full dose.
[01:27:01.720 --> 01:27:03.520]  In week two, you get half the dose.
[01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:06.720]  In week three, you get one-fourth the dose, and so on.
[01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:08.480]  And it goes down at about 10 weeks.
[01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:12.080]  It's called zero by most people who are nuclear scientists.
[01:27:12.080 --> 01:27:13.480]  But this is the issue.
[01:27:13.480 --> 01:27:19.680]  And cesium, it's about 300 years before it's down to zero levels, which is why even in
[01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:23.480]  Chernobyl today in the surrounding areas, you can't grow food.
[01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:27.880]  And there's no birds, there's no insects in the bloom area.
[01:27:27.880 --> 01:27:32.640]  Now, again, they say the storm surge was 25 to 30 feet Fukushima.
[01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:35.320]  This is 15 to 20 feet, they're estimating.
[01:27:35.320 --> 01:27:38.960]  The problem is, as you said, the reactor is right up the river, only a few miles from
[01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:39.960]  the coast.
[01:27:39.960 --> 01:27:44.960]  We're talking about if 20-foot waves get into that, this is not good.
[01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:49.360]  And the other thing that we saw after Fukushima, of course, is iodine supplies were wiped
[01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:50.360]  out everywhere.
[01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:54.680]  I know that your store offers, I think, survival shield.
[01:27:54.680 --> 01:27:57.120]  I don't recall the exact name, but you've got to be like that.
[01:27:57.120 --> 01:27:58.120]  Yeah, survival shield, yeah, really good.
[01:27:58.120 --> 01:28:00.960]  I mean, obviously, I don't know if people can get it in time for this, but people can
[01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:02.560]  get Himalayan salt, has it as well.
[01:28:02.560 --> 01:28:06.320]  The point is, is that iodine is so good for the body, and you know, it's one of the missing
[01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:07.320]  links.
[01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:11.280]  But yeah, infowarstore.com does have the survival shield, so that everybody can have.
[01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:14.840]  People can also, if they can't get your product, if you're sold out, and I know you're not
[01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:17.040]  price gouging like a lot of people did back in Fukushima.
[01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:18.040]  We're actually discounting it.
[01:28:18.040 --> 01:28:20.280]  We offer it at the normal price, right?
[01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:24.000]  But people can also eat seaweed, you know, seaweed has a large amount of iodine in it.
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.840]  You know, you'd have to check with your doctor to get the right amount to eat, but there
[01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:30.480]  are some other sources you can get if you don't have supplementary iodine, but people
[01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:31.480]  need to be prepared for this.
[01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:32.480]  This is no joke.
[01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:33.480]  Yeah, it has a problem.
[01:28:33.480 --> 01:28:35.400]  Some Himalayan salts have it, but a lot of them don't, right?
[01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:36.400]  That's right.
[01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:37.400]  That's right.
[01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:41.000]  So the big thing is, get to the health food store and get seaweed.
[01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:42.000]  Seaweed tablets.
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:43.000]  Seaweed.
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:44.000]  Just eat seaweed, actually.
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:47.280]  So go out to the ocean and get seaweed.
[01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:48.280]  We'd have it naturally.
[01:28:48.280 --> 01:28:49.280]  Yeah.
[01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:50.280]  Okay.
[01:28:50.280 --> 01:28:51.280]  We'll be right back, folks.
[01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:52.280]  Yeah.
[01:28:52.280 --> 01:28:53.280]  It's crazy.
[01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:54.280]  I hope nothing happens, but this is really bad, folks.
[01:28:54.280 --> 01:28:55.280]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:55.280 --> 01:29:21.280]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:21.280 --> 01:29:47.280]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:47.280 --> 01:30:13.280]  We'll be right back.
[01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:39.280]  We'll be right back.
[01:30:39.280 --> 01:31:05.280]  We'll be right back.
[01:31:05.280 --> 01:31:31.280]  We'll be right back.
[01:31:31.280 --> 01:31:58.280]  We'll be right back.
[01:31:58.280 --> 01:32:24.280]  We'll be right back.
[01:32:24.280 --> 01:32:50.280]  We'll be right back.
[01:32:50.280 --> 01:33:19.280]  We'll be right back.
[01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:24.280]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:33:24.280 --> 01:33:35.280]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:35.280 --> 01:33:36.280]  All right, folks.
[01:33:36.280 --> 01:33:39.280]  We are back live, and I want to be clear.
[01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:43.280]  I'm not here pitching Survival Shield X2 because it's good for your thyroid and blocks
[01:33:43.280 --> 01:33:46.280]  the radioactive isotope of nuclear reactors meltdown.
[01:33:46.280 --> 01:33:52.280]  I don't promote Survival Shield X2 as an anti-radiation situation, even though it's
[01:33:52.280 --> 01:33:54.280]  really good for that.
[01:33:54.280 --> 01:33:57.280]  I promote it because you die without iodine.
[01:33:57.280 --> 01:34:02.280]  It's like oxygen or water or vitamin C, and we had a really good seaweed source.
[01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:06.280]  It was one of the top rated in the world five years ago, and the globalist doing economic
[01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:10.280]  sabotage reached out, found out where we were getting it, and blocked it.
[01:34:10.280 --> 01:34:13.280]  So then we found a source working with a big top U.S. lab that doesn't want to be named,
[01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:19.280]  was to get harassed, to get it from oil companies where it's 999999 pure.
[01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:22.280]  You got to have a DEA license to get it.
[01:34:22.280 --> 01:34:24.280]  Once it's put in the palm oil, it isn't.
[01:34:24.280 --> 01:34:25.280]  It's all patented.
[01:34:25.280 --> 01:34:29.280]  This has been our best seller, but the oil companies then figured out what was going on,
[01:34:29.280 --> 01:34:31.280]  so they doubled the triple prices.
[01:34:31.280 --> 01:34:33.280]  I'm not going to sell this for $50.
[01:34:33.280 --> 01:34:35.280]  I'm not going to pay $20-something for it.
[01:34:35.280 --> 01:34:37.280]  I'm not going to sit there and do that.
[01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:43.280]  So I did a huge order at the old price, and then they still raised it.
[01:34:43.280 --> 01:34:44.280]  So I broke my contract.
[01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:45.280]  I said, that's it.
[01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:46.280]  No more X2.
[01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:48.280]  And this is the best purest iodine out there.
[01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:49.280]  Everybody sees the difference.
[01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:51.280]  The others are bound to stuff.
[01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:52.280]  I wish there was other ones.
[01:34:52.280 --> 01:34:58.280]  We're working right now with some other petroleum exploring companies.
[01:34:58.280 --> 01:35:02.280]  Try to have a new X2, because we'll call it X3.
[01:35:02.280 --> 01:35:06.280]  And we may be close, but this is the last run of X2.
[01:35:06.280 --> 01:35:08.280]  So I broke in the contract.
[01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:09.280]  This is it.
[01:35:09.280 --> 01:35:10.280]  X2, it's amazing.
[01:35:10.280 --> 01:35:12.280]  When I first took X2, it's made me lazy.
[01:35:12.280 --> 01:35:15.280]  I used to swim two miles a couple days a week and lift.
[01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:16.280]  I couldn't get the fat off.
[01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:20.280]  I went from 280 pounds to 230-something pounds.
[01:35:20.280 --> 01:35:21.280]  I got a big head and big chest.
[01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:22.280]  I was like, I'm fat.
[01:35:22.280 --> 01:35:23.280]  I'm not.
[01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:24.280]  My clothes off.
[01:35:24.280 --> 01:35:25.280]  I'm like a gorilla.
[01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:31.280]  But the point is, is that, I'm big-boned, is that this stuff changed my life.
[01:35:31.280 --> 01:35:35.280]  Now talk to your physician, because if you've already got previous issues, who knows?
[01:35:35.280 --> 01:35:37.280]  But iodine is life-giving.
[01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:39.280]  This is the end of X2.
[01:35:39.280 --> 01:35:41.280]  And I hope and pray to God we get something better.
[01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:43.280]  People say, well, why are you 25% off?
[01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:45.280]  I always discount products.
[01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:50.280]  And like Mike Adams said, it feels weird with all this going on, or this being the end of X2, to do that.
[01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:53.280]  We normally discount it 25%, okay?
[01:35:53.280 --> 01:35:58.280]  And so until we get down to a few thousand bottles, it's going to be there.
[01:35:58.280 --> 01:36:02.280]  And then it's going to go to the full price in the last few thousand bottles.
[01:36:02.280 --> 01:36:05.280]  M4store.com, M4slife.com.
[01:36:05.280 --> 01:36:06.280]  And then you know you're getting a great product.
[01:36:06.280 --> 01:36:07.280]  Just experience.
[01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:08.280]  It takes a few weeks.
[01:36:08.280 --> 01:36:12.280]  Now, when I first started taking it five years ago, before you even sold it, they had patents.
[01:36:12.280 --> 01:36:14.280]  It was the newest thing.
[01:36:14.280 --> 01:36:18.280]  Folks said about two, three weeks in, you're going to feel really toxic and bad.
[01:36:18.280 --> 01:36:22.280]  And stuff's going to come out of your skin, and those spots on your face are going to go away.
[01:36:22.280 --> 01:36:24.280]  The sunspots, I thought, oh yeah, right.
[01:36:24.280 --> 01:36:25.280]  It all happened.
[01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:26.280]  But it was disgusting.
[01:36:26.280 --> 01:36:29.280]  I mean, all this stuff came out of my skin.
[01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:32.280]  These things happened because this is what powers the whole body.
[01:36:32.280 --> 01:36:34.280]  And this is pure, so it goes right into your blood.
[01:36:34.280 --> 01:36:37.280]  I mean, the stuff we have so pure turns into gas above 90 degrees.
[01:36:37.280 --> 01:36:39.280]  Right there, like I dream a genie if you're watching.
[01:36:39.280 --> 01:36:41.280]  It's purple gas.
[01:36:41.280 --> 01:36:43.280]  And that's not, again, a fiction movie.
[01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:44.280]  That's happening.
[01:36:44.280 --> 01:36:45.280]  That's how pure it is.
[01:36:45.280 --> 01:36:46.280]  Nobody else has got this.
[01:36:46.280 --> 01:36:49.280]  And so this could be the end of it.
[01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:50.280]  We'll see.
[01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:52.280]  But I'm really working hard.
[01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:57.280]  SurvivalShieldX2, M4store.com, M4slife.com, or AAA-253-3139.
[01:36:57.280 --> 01:36:59.280]  All right, getting back to Mike Adams.
[01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:02.280]  I want to get into censorship and the attacks and striking back against it.
[01:37:02.280 --> 01:37:04.280]  Your emergency warning for the president.
[01:37:04.280 --> 01:37:06.280]  The next segment is so powerful that went viral.
[01:37:06.280 --> 01:37:11.280]  But Mike, recapping why this hurricane is so devastating.
[01:37:11.280 --> 01:37:15.280]  They say it's four category now.
[01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:20.280]  Maybe going to six, hitting T-boning, major reactors, 12 in the path,
[01:37:20.280 --> 01:37:22.280]  one directly in the path, or two directly in the path.
[01:37:22.280 --> 01:37:24.280]  Why that's so important?
[01:37:24.280 --> 01:37:27.280]  What are the prices of these rotting reactors?
[01:37:27.280 --> 01:37:30.280]  Well, let's back up and look at reactor design.
[01:37:30.280 --> 01:37:33.280]  There's a much safer reactor design that has existed for many years
[01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:36.280]  that is self-cooling or self-regulating.
[01:37:36.280 --> 01:37:38.280]  But they don't want to use those reactors
[01:37:38.280 --> 01:37:42.280]  because they don't produce nuclear weapons fuel as a byproduct.
[01:37:42.280 --> 01:37:48.280]  So the nuclear power industry has always had ties to the nuclear weapons industry.
[01:37:48.280 --> 01:37:52.280]  And as a result, they run a very unsafe design structure
[01:37:52.280 --> 01:37:56.280]  that has made people vulnerable to catastrophic failures,
[01:37:56.280 --> 01:37:58.280]  like what we saw in Fukushima.
[01:37:58.280 --> 01:38:01.280]  So in essence, they're sacrificing the public safety
[01:38:01.280 --> 01:38:07.280]  in order to keep the nuclear weapons fuel refining or byproduct industry alive.
[01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:09.280]  That's the first thing to realize.
[01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:11.280]  It's like the powers that be.
[01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:13.280]  Don't care about the American people.
[01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:17.280]  They don't care that they could irradiate and kill millions of people
[01:38:17.280 --> 01:38:19.280]  if there's a catastrophic failure.
[01:38:19.280 --> 01:38:23.280]  Also, by the way, these nuclear power plants are subject to cyber hacks.
[01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:27.280]  And many people believe that they've been penetrated by Chinese hackers,
[01:38:27.280 --> 01:38:31.280]  in particular, who are just waiting to pull the trigger on a certain day
[01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:36.280]  in a coordinated attack on the power grid and nuclear power facilities
[01:38:36.280 --> 01:38:39.280]  and fuel refineries and other key infrastructures.
[01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:42.280]  And they could use the hurricane as the cover.
[01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:44.280]  Well, absolutely.
[01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:49.280]  There are lots of ways that bad people could use the chaos of a hurricane
[01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:52.280]  to pull off many things, including one of the things, by the way,
[01:38:52.280 --> 01:38:57.280]  that you've been warning about, which is an attempted assassination of President Trump.
[01:38:57.280 --> 01:39:00.280]  And I agree with you that's a very real risk.
[01:39:00.280 --> 01:39:05.280]  And the chaos of this storm will no doubt be leveraged in some way.
[01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:08.280]  The chaos in Washington, D.C. even will be leveraged in some way
[01:39:08.280 --> 01:39:10.280]  to try to harm President Trump.
[01:39:10.280 --> 01:39:13.280]  But as far as this hurricane goes, I say everybody be prepared.
[01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:15.280]  Watch the hurricane path.
[01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:18.280]  Evacuate if you have an evacuation order.
[01:39:18.280 --> 01:39:21.280]  And if you don't, if you don't evacuate, even if you're in the surrounding areas,
[01:39:21.280 --> 01:39:23.280]  you better have a water filter. No joke.
[01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:27.280]  Because contaminated water is one of the biggest risks in the aftermath of flooding.
[01:39:27.280 --> 01:39:29.280]  When you have flooding, what do you get?
[01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:33.280]  You get cholera and E. coli and all kinds of salmonella and things.
[01:39:33.280 --> 01:39:35.280]  I was about to say, let's hit the other angles of this.
[01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:39.280]  No matter what Trump does, they're going to say he does a terrible job.
[01:39:39.280 --> 01:39:42.280]  But I think he needs to get emergency teams of these reactors right now.
[01:39:42.280 --> 01:39:46.280]  He needs to just be upfront already responding to the hurricane,
[01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:48.280]  not just waiting because they're going to spend this,
[01:39:48.280 --> 01:39:50.280]  even though he's done a great job at the last few hurricanes,
[01:39:50.280 --> 01:39:52.280]  they're going to say he didn't do a good job.
[01:39:52.280 --> 01:39:55.280]  Well, yeah, of course, of course they are.
[01:39:55.280 --> 01:39:59.280]  But nevertheless, he has the power right now.
[01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:02.280]  I mean, he could declare a national emergency for this situation.
[01:40:02.280 --> 01:40:05.280]  Actually, we're already operating under a national emergency for other reasons
[01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:06.280]  that we could talk about later.
[01:40:06.280 --> 01:40:09.280]  In fact, we've been operating under a state of war since 2001.
[01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:13.280]  And that's how the Democrats in the deep state stay behind or blocking Trump.
[01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:17.280]  They're operating in the emergency government areas that Trump has even gotten access to.
[01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:19.280]  He can't even run the White House.
[01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:21.280]  Not because he's incompetent, because he's surrounded by enemies.
[01:40:21.280 --> 01:40:23.280]  That's right. That's right.
[01:40:23.280 --> 01:40:25.280]  They are enemies of America.
[01:40:25.280 --> 01:40:27.280]  I'm happy to comment on that in more detail.
[01:40:27.280 --> 01:40:32.280]  And by the way, one phrase I want to mention, military tribunals.
[01:40:32.280 --> 01:40:33.280]  That is the answer to this.
[01:40:33.280 --> 01:40:36.280]  Military tribunals for the deep state traders.
[01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:39.280]  But maybe we'll talk about that in a minute.
[01:40:39.280 --> 01:40:42.280]  But getting back to the hurricane situation, everybody, watch the maps.
[01:40:42.280 --> 01:40:44.280]  Watch the NOAA maps.
[01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:47.280]  Watch the projections of how big the storm surge is going to be,
[01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:49.280]  how much rainfall and flooding there's going to be.
[01:40:49.280 --> 01:40:52.280]  And just be ready, everybody.
[01:40:52.280 --> 01:40:55.280]  Three days of preparedness is not enough, in my opinion.
[01:40:55.280 --> 01:40:59.280]  You need to have several weeks at minimum of preparedness for this storm,
[01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:01.280]  even if you're not in the direct path of it,
[01:41:01.280 --> 01:41:06.280]  because there could be logistics breakdowns across the entire U.S. east coast,
[01:41:06.280 --> 01:41:11.280]  all the way from the southern tip of Florida to, you know, up in New York City,
[01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:13.280]  for that matter, or Boston, for that matter.
[01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:15.280]  So let me ask you this question.
[01:41:15.280 --> 01:41:17.280]  They were saying yesterday and today, whether underground are usually pretty accurate,
[01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:19.280]  that it was going to get up to a six.
[01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:21.280]  Now they're saying it's only a four, that'll be a three.
[01:41:21.280 --> 01:41:24.280]  I mean, do you think that's accurate, or who knows?
[01:41:24.280 --> 01:41:28.280]  Well, these software models fail all the time.
[01:41:28.280 --> 01:41:33.280]  I mean, they get better over the years, but even like the climate change software models are a total joke.
[01:41:33.280 --> 01:41:34.280]  So I don't trust the models.
[01:41:34.280 --> 01:41:38.280]  You know, reality is what matters, and reality can't be 100% predicted.
[01:41:38.280 --> 01:41:41.280]  All you could do is control your preparedness.
[01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:46.280]  You're ready for anything that comes down, whether it's a category three, four, or five.
[01:41:46.280 --> 01:41:47.280]  Well, that's right.
[01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:48.280]  Only reality matters.
[01:41:48.280 --> 01:41:50.280]  That's a good bumper sticker.
[01:41:50.280 --> 01:41:54.280]  Only reality matters, because it's such an insane asylum of craziness.
[01:41:54.280 --> 01:41:56.280]  We're going to go to Brighton, come back and talk about,
[01:41:56.280 --> 01:41:59.280]  it's now mainstream news, inside groups over to the president.
[01:41:59.280 --> 01:42:01.280]  CNN says Mike Pence ready to take over.
[01:42:01.280 --> 01:42:03.280]  Trump removed Trump.
[01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:04.280]  Trump's mismanaged.
[01:42:04.280 --> 01:42:06.280]  Trump's as bad as 9-11.
[01:42:06.280 --> 01:42:08.280]  What planet are they living on?
[01:42:08.280 --> 01:42:13.280]  How do they think they're going to kill this economy and kill the voters' wishes and get rid of Trump?
[01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:16.280]  Aren't they thinking, Mike, about what will happen if they remove Trump?
[01:42:16.280 --> 01:42:20.280]  The thing is, they're willing to destroy America to remove Trump.
[01:42:20.280 --> 01:42:21.280]  Never forget that.
[01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:26.280]  They are willing to unleash a catastrophic economic collapse,
[01:42:26.280 --> 01:42:32.280]  or even, I believe, some kind of a large-scale weapon of mass destruction in your city to take Trump out.
[01:42:32.280 --> 01:42:34.280]  Oh, they're willing to set it off EMP, anything.
[01:42:34.280 --> 01:42:36.280]  They are crazed maniacs.
[01:42:36.280 --> 01:42:37.280]  I've experienced it.
[01:42:37.280 --> 01:42:38.280]  You've experienced it.
[01:42:38.280 --> 01:42:42.280]  Well, they're right back with Mike Adams getting into incredible censorship,
[01:42:42.280 --> 01:42:43.280]  56 days out.
[01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:45.280]  What's the global's next move?
[01:42:45.280 --> 01:42:46.280]  How do we counter him?
[01:42:46.280 --> 01:42:47.280]  How do we win?
[01:42:47.280 --> 01:42:50.280]  I think, number one, we pray to God for the eyes to be opened and for providence.
[01:42:50.280 --> 01:42:52.280]  We need to be praying right now, folks.
[01:42:52.280 --> 01:43:21.280]  Everybody does.

[01:43:57.280 --> 01:44:02.120]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is. The real drama can be
[01:44:02.120 --> 01:44:07.360]  found here in Lelani Estates, but a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and
[01:44:07.360 --> 01:44:12.880]  we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain. Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal
[01:44:12.880 --> 01:44:18.520]  particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels. To find
[01:44:18.520 --> 01:44:25.120]  out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH. What we learned
[01:44:25.120 --> 01:44:30.120]  was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[01:44:30.120 --> 01:44:35.280]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy
[01:44:35.280 --> 01:44:41.360]  metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels. As
[01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:47.000]  it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water. So what we've
[01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:52.560]  learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply. But more
[01:44:52.560 --> 01:44:58.320]  importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[01:44:58.320 --> 01:45:03.040]  We knew it was coming. The whole thing was for me leg. First demonize info wars, lie
[01:45:03.040 --> 01:45:08.280]  about us, build a straw man, then sue us to add credibility to that, then have a few fake
[01:45:08.280 --> 01:45:14.400]  strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying children and Islamophobia.
[01:45:14.400 --> 01:45:21.040]  And then walla two weeks later, ban info wars completely off of dozens of major platforms
[01:45:21.040 --> 01:45:27.600]  where we were all in the top five or top 10 news feeds. Go to info wars.com, forward slash

[01:45:51.440 --> 01:45:55.320]  how they can then reach out to others with the information and point out this is the
[01:45:55.320 --> 01:46:00.280]  verboten info. This is what they don't want you to see. I want to plow into all of this.
[01:46:00.280 --> 01:46:07.320]  I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging listeners to understand that
[01:46:07.320 --> 01:46:13.440]  when you buy t shirts or water filtration systems or books or videos or other material
[01:46:13.440 --> 01:46:19.640]  from info wars store.com, you are funding the revolution. I mean, I cannot say it any
[01:46:19.640 --> 01:46:24.320]  clear. And so it is essential that you purchase the products at info wars store.com. I don't
[01:46:24.320 --> 01:46:27.840]  want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride free toothpaste with

[01:46:51.160 --> 01:46:54.720]  who they are. And they know we know who they are. And they're coming back against us. So
[01:46:54.720 --> 01:47:02.000]  we need your support.
[01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:08.040]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:47:08.040 --> 01:47:17.920]  So you've been on YouTube for years and you know who I am.
[01:47:17.920 --> 01:47:22.880]  I'm primitive. I'm real. I know the enemy. And if we can have the spirit of normal humanity
[01:47:22.880 --> 01:47:33.440]  spread, it's over for the globalist. You'll never, never defeat the human spirit. You'll
[01:47:33.440 --> 01:47:43.280]  never defeat God. You'll never win. We know who they are. And we're sick of them.
[01:47:43.280 --> 01:47:51.200]  You guys know who he is? Alex Jones. Alex Jones. Alex Jones. Alex Jones. Alex Jones
[01:47:51.200 --> 01:47:55.400]  for Alex Jones. Alex Jones. From info wars. From info wars. Yeah.
[01:47:55.400 --> 01:48:03.840]  But did that stop him? No. It did not. It kept going. Okay. And just it went everywhere.
[01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:09.880]  The more they abuse you, the more you enjoy it just like the Stockholm syndrome. And so
[01:48:09.880 --> 01:48:23.560]  that's why the joke is on you. And that's why it's going to continue.
[01:48:23.560 --> 01:48:29.560]  Repent now. Repent now. I know your mustache is cool. You got little gold frame glasses.
[01:48:29.560 --> 01:48:38.360]  You scared me so bad.
[01:48:38.360 --> 01:48:51.400]  Well, we can have some fun with that. But that was back before we were banned across
[01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:57.800]  the internet. It's so surreal that as Congress doesn't take action, as the president's taken
[01:48:57.800 --> 01:49:02.360]  some action, but not enough, because he's totally sabotaged and surrounded, that they're
[01:49:02.360 --> 01:49:08.600]  now into classical mainline conservative books being banned. It's all over the news. It's
[01:49:08.600 --> 01:49:12.800]  on info wars.com. It's on drugs report.com. We're going to go over some of these articles.
[01:49:12.800 --> 01:49:17.840]  Trump campaign manager Google a direct threat to democracy. He means our republic and online
[01:49:17.840 --> 01:49:24.280]  freedom. And then it's coming out. The Democrats are rigging everything and Google said they'll
[01:49:24.280 --> 01:49:32.240]  deliver everybody to Hillary and now they're going to defeat Trump. They're really absolutely
[01:49:32.240 --> 01:49:39.040]  abusing their power right now as if there's not going to be any future as if they think
[01:49:39.040 --> 01:49:42.920]  they're invincible. And I wanted to ask Mike Adams of naturalnews.com. We can put an article
[01:49:42.920 --> 01:49:48.560]  in the video he did a few days ago that went viral dealing with the fact that this is Trump's
[01:49:48.560 --> 01:49:54.720]  last chance. We put that on screen to really, really, really, really take action. Again,
[01:49:54.720 --> 01:49:58.520]  Paul Watson tweeted out the article. You can go to prison planet. You want to find that
[01:49:58.520 --> 01:50:03.080]  tweet. That's why I like Twitter. It's easy for people to search it. But you know, we
[01:50:03.080 --> 01:50:08.160]  talked about it last segment, but Mike Adams tell people the name of the article and the
[01:50:08.160 --> 01:50:12.360]  name of the video because it's a whole hour you did, but it's really important so we can
[01:50:12.360 --> 01:50:17.120]  put it on screen for people. So we talked about it a couple times last segment. What's
[01:50:17.120 --> 01:50:22.320]  the name of that article and the name of that video for folks who want to pull it up? We'll
[01:50:22.320 --> 01:50:29.320]  fade your mic up. Hold on. We got to start over. We're gonna fade your mic up. Go ahead.
[01:50:29.320 --> 01:50:31.280]  You're on there now. Page of natural news under the column of health ranger articles
[01:50:31.280 --> 01:50:35.760]  and it's called, I believe something like Trump's, yeah, Trump only has one path to
[01:50:35.760 --> 01:50:41.840]  save America from a deep state takeover. And it's kind of a lengthy video that I did discussing,
[01:50:41.840 --> 01:50:47.200]  by the way, the censorship and the deep platforming of you and info wars and how that is a precursor
[01:50:47.200 --> 01:50:51.960]  to the attempted coup and perhaps an assassination attempt of the president and then laying out
[01:50:51.960 --> 01:50:57.240]  in my view, what I believe President Trump must do now to save America. And that begins
[01:50:57.240 --> 01:51:03.440]  with declassifying the FISA warrant documentation surrounding that which would expose the criminal
[01:51:03.440 --> 01:51:11.560]  corruption inside Obama's FBI, DOJ, top officials, James Comey, Loretta Lynch, you know, even
[01:51:11.560 --> 01:51:16.840]  John Brennan and many others. These people in my view then need to be arrested and actually
[01:51:16.840 --> 01:51:23.680]  subjected to military tribunals because they have engaged in essentially acts of war and
[01:51:23.680 --> 01:51:29.760]  sedition at minimum against the United States of America. These are acts of war from domestic
[01:51:29.760 --> 01:51:35.960]  enemies of America. But and now we're finding out that complicit in that is of course, there's
[01:51:35.960 --> 01:51:41.920]  the New York Times running this probably fictional op-ed that they probably wrote themselves
[01:51:41.920 --> 01:51:47.600]  or wrote in consultation with certain anti-Trump people in the administration, but it's not
[01:51:47.600 --> 01:51:52.200]  one person I don't believe inside the administration that wrote that I guess we'll wait and see.
[01:51:52.200 --> 01:51:57.080]  But also, Google has been complicit in trying to steal the election. This just came out
[01:51:57.080 --> 01:52:00.880]  yesterday. Google tried to steal the election to Hillary Clinton. This is now revealed in
[01:52:00.880 --> 01:52:06.280]  emails. So we know that Google engaged in exactly the kind of election meddling that
[01:52:06.280 --> 01:52:12.120]  Trump has or Russia is being accused of doing by the deranged left-wing media. So everything
[01:52:12.120 --> 01:52:17.040]  that the left says that Trump did, it turns out that actually Google did it or the New
[01:52:17.040 --> 01:52:22.920]  York Times did it or the DNC did it. And so this is a crisis. Trump has to take action
[01:52:22.920 --> 01:52:28.920]  now or I believe he will be destroyed by this, this deep state coup.
[01:52:28.920 --> 01:52:34.000]  You're absolutely right, Mike. But I want to go back. One big part of your video is
[01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.880]  they're clearly getting ready to set me and Trump up for a false flag. And I'm going to
[01:52:36.880 --> 01:52:41.600]  do a whole video on this today or tomorrow. They have all these shows where if I confront
[01:52:41.600 --> 01:52:46.440]  Marco Rubio, I'm first nice, like, hey, there's sensory conservatives. Will you do something?
[01:52:46.440 --> 01:52:50.840]  I don't know who you are. So then I get a little more aggressive. They call that bullying
[01:52:50.840 --> 01:52:55.880]  and say, well, Jones isn't being violent, but he's telegraphing secret violent codes
[01:52:55.880 --> 01:53:00.400]  to the one independent AP or like, Jones has armed listeners. He must be taken off the
[01:53:00.400 --> 01:53:05.280]  air. And they're saying we're going to attack reporters. They had all the papers through
[01:53:05.280 --> 01:53:10.920]  the op-eds a month ago that Trump's going to attack reporters. So they put this talking
[01:53:10.920 --> 01:53:14.840]  point out that us saying their liars is going to cause violence. Meanwhile, they're the
[01:53:14.840 --> 01:53:20.360]  ones coming out in Newsday saying they're going to kill me with stabbing me in the neck.
[01:53:20.360 --> 01:53:24.000]  So they're the ones pushing violence, but clearly I think they're planning a false flag
[01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:28.520]  on the media. They wouldn't be pre-programming this so hard if they weren't. And then the
[01:53:28.520 --> 01:53:32.440]  average person will say, well, Alex is so demonized, we're not going to defend him.
[01:53:32.440 --> 01:53:36.240]  And then as soon as that happens, instead of just taking you off Amazon or Google or
[01:53:36.240 --> 01:53:41.920]  Facebook or Twitter, all conservatives will be taken off period. Your bank accounts, everything,
[01:53:41.920 --> 01:53:45.840]  and they think you'll then submit. This is the Chinese Socialist credit score. This is
[01:53:45.840 --> 01:53:53.120]  the mark of the beast. It's here, Mike Adams. So, so the false flag situation, right, right.
[01:53:53.120 --> 01:53:59.120]  I agree with your assessment that they are setting up you in particular to be the fall
[01:53:59.120 --> 01:54:05.200]  guy for whatever false flag event that they engineer and carry out. And let us not forget,
[01:54:05.200 --> 01:54:11.080]  by the way, that the FBI itself was exposed by the New York Times several years ago for
[01:54:11.080 --> 01:54:16.680]  plotting and carrying out terrorist activities where they would recruit sometimes homeless
[01:54:16.680 --> 01:54:20.880]  people off the street or drug addicts off the street. They would recruit them, say, here,
[01:54:20.880 --> 01:54:26.120]  have this van, you know, and the FBI would have a terror plot all planned out. They would
[01:54:26.120 --> 01:54:30.040]  use, you know, mock explosives. They wouldn't actually let it go through, but they would
[01:54:30.040 --> 01:54:36.560]  plan and carry out these attacks with the help of some, you know, some mark that they
[01:54:36.560 --> 01:54:40.960]  would find off the street, whatever. So the FBI has a lot of experience actually plotting
[01:54:40.960 --> 01:54:46.240]  terrorist activities domestically in the United States. Now, not everybody in the FBI is bad,
[01:54:46.240 --> 01:54:52.560]  of course, but the leadership was evil under. Oh, there's a major left to stay behind networks.
[01:54:52.560 --> 01:54:57.200]  And again, every protestor caught taking over the cabinet hearings got caught outside being
[01:54:57.200 --> 01:55:02.680]  paid off cash by a Soros lawyer. So exactly. They just go one level further where the New
[01:55:02.680 --> 01:55:06.880]  York Times goes, Oh, here's where the Freedom Caucus plays baseball. They don't have any
[01:55:06.880 --> 01:55:13.040]  security. And then literally they sent a Dennis Astard acolyte out there and CNN said he was
[01:55:13.040 --> 01:55:19.880]  a hero. So these people are sick. And then the point is that they can stage an event
[01:55:19.880 --> 01:55:25.360]  and then they can by silencing you in advance, you won't be able to defend yourself against
[01:55:25.360 --> 01:55:29.200]  the false narrative that will be rolled out as a false narrative.
[01:55:29.200 --> 01:55:33.600]  I was about to say, did you see the nationwide deal that Facebook force fed to all their
[01:55:33.600 --> 01:55:39.640]  people as they took me off saying Jones bullied poor Native Americans. There's these pig like
[01:55:39.640 --> 01:55:46.400]  racist ladies saying whites are subhuman where monkeys, my parents are brother and sister.
[01:55:46.400 --> 01:55:51.000]  And then they edit that out and have me yelling back at them. Imagine the criminal activity
[01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:52.000]  of Facebook.
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:57.920]  Right, right. And don't forget that the New York Times, of course, hired Sarah Jung,
[01:55:57.920 --> 01:56:03.920]  who it has tweets out there that are racist against white people. They're they're destroying
[01:56:03.920 --> 01:56:09.920]  white grow up in goblin holes in the ground. They're subhuman exterminate them. It's like,
[01:56:09.920 --> 01:56:10.920]  yes, yes.
[01:56:10.920 --> 01:56:16.720]  So the censorship of you, of course, is selective application of their rules that they really
[01:56:16.720 --> 01:56:21.400]  can't even define. Basically, it all comes down to they don't like Alex Jones and they
[01:56:21.400 --> 01:56:27.040]  want to cut you off. But I think it's worth that they blame you for what's coming. And
[01:56:27.040 --> 01:56:31.920]  then they want to use that to cement the silencing of conservative and pro-American voices all
[01:56:31.920 --> 01:56:36.680]  across the country. Oh, I totally agree because I'm not that important. They picked me to
[01:56:36.680 --> 01:56:42.320]  build me up to be destroyed because they knew we were a populist movement. And then once
[01:56:42.320 --> 01:56:45.840]  people don't stand up for me when it happens, then everyone loses everything.
[01:56:45.840 --> 01:56:50.520]  That's right. That's right. And then there will be no one left to speak on behalf of
[01:56:50.520 --> 01:56:55.400]  President Trump when they try to pull a 25th Amendment or an execution or a weapon of mass
[01:56:55.400 --> 01:57:00.440]  destruction or something else. They they I am convinced Alex, they will kill any number
[01:57:00.440 --> 01:57:05.400]  of people necessary or destroy the entire economy if necessary to get Trump out of
[01:57:05.400 --> 01:57:09.280]  office. I agree. This is a war because the chai comms and the globalist America was done.
[01:57:09.280 --> 01:57:12.560]  The deal was going to happen. People found out about it. They said no. And now we're
[01:57:12.560 --> 01:57:15.520]  in the fight of our lives. We'll be right back with five more minutes with Mike Adams.
[01:57:15.520 --> 01:57:20.080]  We have another special guest joining us. But this isn't hype. We're being silenced.
[01:57:20.080 --> 01:57:23.960]  Amazon's banning conservative books. They're just testing, testing, testing. And I've been
[01:57:23.960 --> 01:57:30.200]  told by two White House sources, a campaign source, and then another source connected
[01:57:30.200 --> 01:57:34.600]  to the president and his outreach programs, four sources that the executive orders are
[01:57:34.600 --> 01:57:39.160]  imminent. But they've got to be. They're the ones that started the fight. America is at
[01:57:39.160 --> 01:57:43.680]  the crossroads. America is hanging by a thread. We'll be back. Spread the live links. Tell
[01:57:43.680 --> 01:57:52.600]  folks about local stations right now.

[02:00:08.680 --> 02:00:15.680]  The end of time and the Mississippi River she's a gold drive. I live back in the woods
[02:00:15.680 --> 02:00:22.920]  you see. The interest is up and the stock market's down and you're only getting mugged
[02:00:22.920 --> 02:00:34.920]  if you go downtown. I live back in the woods you see. A woman and the kids and the dogs
[02:00:34.920 --> 02:00:45.840]  and me. I got a shotgun a rifle and a four wheel drive and a country boy can survive.
[02:00:45.840 --> 02:00:51.760]  Mike Adams of naturalnews.com has put together a really powerful long detailed article about
[02:00:51.760 --> 02:00:56.560]  Fukushima and America 12 nuclear power plants are in the path of hurricane Florence flooding
[02:00:56.560 --> 02:01:01.280]  storm surge threatening cooling operations. It's the same scenario as Fukushima. We're
[02:01:01.280 --> 02:01:06.000]  not saying that's happening. We're saying we want to draw additional attention to it
[02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:10.360]  because these corporations will just hope nothing happens and they don't want any bad
[02:01:10.360 --> 02:01:15.520]  PR so they won't muster an emergency like Japan did and then the crisis happens. Mike
[02:01:15.520 --> 02:01:19.280]  in closing I appreciate your great work. You've been doing great things for decades but now
[02:01:19.280 --> 02:01:25.960]  you've really been doing a yeoman's work, herculean work in the Aegean stables here.
[02:01:25.960 --> 02:01:30.160]  Just in closing in the four minutes we have left I get a little hysterical here on there
[02:01:30.160 --> 02:01:34.440]  because I live in the middle of this and we see the mutiny, the preparations, the 25th
[02:01:34.440 --> 02:01:38.080]  amendment calls to remove the president. Them saying he's doing a horrible job, the economy
[02:01:38.080 --> 02:01:43.120]  coming back. It is the best of time, worst of time tale of two cities and I'm just asking
[02:01:43.120 --> 02:01:48.680]  listeners politically get in the arena. The next 56 days are so critical in closing. What
[02:01:48.680 --> 02:01:53.880]  else do you want to impart to people about? We're all blocked everywhere on 90% of the
[02:01:53.880 --> 02:01:57.800]  web. It's up to them to share the articles, the videos. This is total war and if they
[02:01:57.800 --> 02:02:04.160]  get off the bench, if the big dog gets off the bench, it's game over and we did that
[02:02:04.160 --> 02:02:10.880]  to Hillary already but I believe the globalists have miscalculated. I believe if we take action
[02:02:10.880 --> 02:02:16.080]  we're about to see a new true renaissance for humanity.
[02:02:16.080 --> 02:02:21.600]  Well Trump has the power to save this republic. The question is will he invoke it aggressively
[02:02:21.600 --> 02:02:37.160]  and in time? Interestingly, the executive wars into power that have now powers and other
[02:02:37.160 --> 02:02:41.520]  similar powers that he could invoke right now and solve this problem and arrest the deep
[02:02:41.520 --> 02:02:46.200]  state traders and put this country back on course to what it's supposed to be which is
[02:02:46.200 --> 02:02:52.440]  a free constitutional republic that respects individual liberty. He must now at this point
[02:02:52.440 --> 02:02:57.600]  realize that it's a matter of not just saving America but also saving himself, it's self-preservation
[02:02:57.600 --> 02:03:02.680]  at this point. If he does not invoke these powers, if he does not get rid of Jeff Sessions,
[02:03:02.680 --> 02:03:09.120]  if he does not issue arrests for Hillary Clinton, then basically this republic is over. But
[02:03:09.120 --> 02:03:14.880]  I want President Trump to know that we the people are behind him and we back him and
[02:03:14.880 --> 02:03:21.240]  if he puts out a call and says, I need all the American patriots right now to come to
[02:03:21.240 --> 02:03:26.040]  Washington and defend this country against deep state traders, he would have a million
[02:03:26.040 --> 02:03:33.760]  men and women show up and defend this nation. He has all the cards and he's a judicious
[02:03:33.760 --> 02:03:38.040]  good guy so he keeps thinking all he needs prosperity. No, the globalists like you said
[02:03:38.040 --> 02:03:43.440]  are willing to wreck everything, it's about power. I believe that mass arrests need to
[02:03:43.440 --> 02:03:47.800]  be made against these deep state traders, they need to be exposed. They're globalists,
[02:03:47.800 --> 02:03:51.680]  they're trying to subvert us, exactly. You can't deal with them like a normal political
[02:03:51.680 --> 02:03:55.960]  group, they're an enemy army. No, and hopefully Trump has long passed to the point of trying
[02:03:55.960 --> 02:04:02.160]  to get along with the opposition. You can't get along with traders, they're not interested
[02:04:02.160 --> 02:04:06.080]  in co-existence. They're not giving quarters, they're trying to dominate us. That's right,
[02:04:06.080 --> 02:04:08.760]  that's right. Look, they want to overthrow the country, they want communism to sweep
[02:04:08.760 --> 02:04:14.440]  in. And they've drawn first blood politically. Well, absolutely they have and the evidence
[02:04:14.440 --> 02:04:20.400]  is there, President Trump just release it, declassify. It's all there. History is waiting
[02:04:20.400 --> 02:04:26.400]  for you to make this decision, just do it. Nike should have President Trump as their
[02:04:26.400 --> 02:04:31.680]  spokesperson, frankly, just do it, President Trump, release the documents. He needs to
[02:04:31.680 --> 02:04:36.160]  right now release the secret documents and everything else. Mike Adams, powerful information

[02:06:23.760 --> 02:06:53.720]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info Wars.
[02:06:53.720 --> 02:07:17.000]  Alright folks, we're back live here in the third hour. Paul Watson's host for the fourth
[02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:22.280]  hour. He's got one of the best selling authors and just got banned off of Amazon. First time
[02:07:22.280 --> 02:07:27.840]  ever an author has been banned for a dating book about, you know, for conservative men.
[02:07:27.840 --> 02:07:31.440]  This is just getting crazy. That's coming up in the fourth hour. Clyde Lewis could be
[02:07:31.440 --> 02:07:35.280]  on there for 10 hours. I was on this show for three hours and you know, I've heard a
[02:07:35.280 --> 02:07:39.960]  show many times syndicated to 400 stations of you know, very popular filmmaker in his
[02:07:39.960 --> 02:07:47.320]  own right. But I was on his show and I had forgotten so many things he was talking about
[02:07:47.320 --> 02:07:51.880]  about the internet kill switch and about this special FCC office that Obama set up to be
[02:07:51.880 --> 02:07:55.520]  able to take over the internet and put people inside newsrooms. And then with what I've
[02:07:55.520 --> 02:07:59.880]  dealt with the media, the terms and things they were using were exactly what's happening
[02:07:59.880 --> 02:08:03.640]  to me now. And then I looked at the executive order while it was on his show for three hours
[02:08:03.640 --> 02:08:07.760]  during breaks. And I was like, wow, somebody just taught me something. And I learned stuff
[02:08:07.760 --> 02:08:12.840]  all the time. But when it comes to martial law kill switches, how it works, a lot of
[02:08:12.840 --> 02:08:16.760]  folks don't teach me stuff. And so I was like, please come on my show. And he's a late night
[02:08:16.760 --> 02:08:21.600]  house is like, okay, I will but I want to invite him back for three hours in the near future.
[02:08:21.600 --> 02:08:26.200]  Obama quietly signs the countering disinformation and propaganda act. Remember that? And then
[02:08:26.200 --> 02:08:30.300]  that's what's set up with the old corporate media, the big tech companies, the censorship
[02:08:30.300 --> 02:08:34.720]  claiming we're all Russians. And once they say you're a Russian, then they turn the CIA
[02:08:34.720 --> 02:08:40.560]  loose on you. His big article keeping up with the Jones are red face canary in the coal
[02:08:40.560 --> 02:08:45.000]  mine. And then this goes back to articles he wrote three, four years ago, the tailing
[02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:51.360]  and all the FCC aborts plan to infiltrate newsrooms. That's the heavy.com commissioner
[02:08:51.360 --> 02:08:56.960]  pie statement on suspension of CI in study. So Clyde's a nice guy, he'll pause a lot
[02:08:56.960 --> 02:09:02.320]  for me. But if that if that happens, you'll never get to talk. So I'm going to give him
[02:09:02.320 --> 02:09:09.000]  the floor for most of this hour, a brief guide to the FCC newsroom invasion panic. But Obama
[02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:13.560]  did set up the kill switch and then he left it behind. And just like you read about, look
[02:09:13.560 --> 02:09:19.480]  at these headlines, Trump loyalist for White House purge. And you've got Donald Trump, Jr.
[02:09:19.480 --> 02:09:25.400]  coming out saying, yeah, he only trust like five people in the White House because they're
[02:09:25.400 --> 02:09:30.120]  revolting against him. People keep saying Trump do this, do that. The bureaucracies aren't
[02:09:30.120 --> 02:09:35.320]  doing what he says. Atlantic monthly, two months into Trump in office says we need 25th
[02:09:35.320 --> 02:09:38.920]  amendment. We need everybody in the agency to not follow what he says in sabotaging.
[02:09:38.920 --> 02:09:44.080]  Well, he's only gotten partial tax cuts and partial regulation fixes and announced America
[02:09:44.080 --> 02:09:48.600]  open for business and all the graphs are going straight up. And here's that article, Trump
[02:09:48.600 --> 02:09:54.560]  only trust small group in White House after op ed sunset. This is a Psyop. So I got to
[02:09:54.560 --> 02:10:00.800]  say I'm really completely blown away. I was blown away with Clyde Lewis when I was on
[02:10:00.800 --> 02:10:09.000]  with him and everything that he got into on the show. So I want him to take your next
[02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:14.960]  level on the big event, the final blow. He calls it ground zero media, ground zero media
[02:10:14.960 --> 02:10:20.320]  dot org or Clyde Lewis on Twitter for now. I know he got persecuted for even having me
[02:10:20.320 --> 02:10:25.040]  on on Facebook. So ground zero media dot org Clyde Lewis. Thank you so much for joining
[02:10:25.040 --> 02:10:29.160]  us on September 11th, 2018.
[02:10:29.160 --> 02:10:34.320]  I think it's a coincidence. I wasn't really thinking about 9 11, but I think it's a good
[02:10:34.320 --> 02:10:39.520]  time to have us both together on 9 11, especially with all the hard work you did to bring forward
[02:10:39.520 --> 02:10:46.240]  information back then and the work that I did as well. You know, it's interesting that
[02:10:46.240 --> 02:10:51.920]  I remember one of the things, one of the points that the mainstream media had made to shut
[02:10:51.920 --> 02:10:59.120]  you down was you saying that 9 11 was an inside job. I just want to make it clear that 84
[02:10:59.120 --> 02:11:05.400]  percent of the American people believe that 9 11 was not explained correctly, that the
[02:11:05.400 --> 02:11:11.640]  information and the investigation was pretty much a farce that were national national polls
[02:11:11.640 --> 02:11:12.640]  on that.
[02:11:12.640 --> 02:11:17.920]  Yeah. National polls saying that, Hey, we didn't get an investigation. We wanted even
[02:11:17.920 --> 02:11:22.520]  the media itself back then, if you recall, we're saying things like Osama bin Laden was
[02:11:22.520 --> 02:11:30.400]  not involved. Even Dick Cheney had said in a press conference something about how Osama
[02:11:30.400 --> 02:11:35.160]  bin Laden wasn't involved. And there are a number of things too, like Tom Brokaw, if
[02:11:35.160 --> 02:11:38.080]  I remember, and a number of other newscasts.
[02:11:38.080 --> 02:11:43.120]  Prince Vandar famously the week after went on. I said, Oh, what an erupt. Here we go.
[02:11:43.120 --> 02:11:46.600]  He won a Larry King and said that bin Laden wasn't involved.
[02:11:46.600 --> 02:11:52.160]  Yeah. And if you want to know where the conspiracy theories come from, I mean, the newsrooms
[02:11:52.160 --> 02:11:57.520]  themselves, I remember Peter Jennings, Tom Brokaw were saying, if you look at the buildings
[02:11:57.520 --> 02:12:03.160]  come down, if you're familiar with how controlled demolitions operate, you'll notice how the
[02:12:03.160 --> 02:12:09.360]  buildings have come down uniformly. And I was surprised that not very many people had
[02:12:09.360 --> 02:12:14.640]  picked up on that. I picked up on that because I'm a media junkie and I have to pay attention
[02:12:14.640 --> 02:12:20.480]  to what the mainstream says in order to, I guess, counter what they say, examine what
[02:12:20.480 --> 02:12:21.480]  they say.
[02:12:21.480 --> 02:12:25.080]  Now, my theory that the FBI was ordered to stand down, dozens of agents came forward
[02:12:25.080 --> 02:12:27.160]  and said that. I was just saying what they said.
[02:12:27.160 --> 02:12:32.000]  Well, and not only that, but you remember too that there was a number of, I guess you
[02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:36.280]  call them preparedness drills with regard to, you know, whether or not planes could
[02:12:36.280 --> 02:12:43.760]  fly into areas and destroy buildings. In fact, I remember back during the Olympics, when
[02:12:43.760 --> 02:12:47.960]  they had them in Georgia, Condoleezza Rice and several others were already in the planning.
[02:12:47.960 --> 02:12:52.280]  I mean, they said, well, I mean, Condoleezza Rice had said, well, we didn't even plan on
[02:12:52.280 --> 02:12:53.280]  this to happen.
[02:12:53.280 --> 02:12:57.640]  But yet when the Olympics happened in Georgia, they were already planning for contingency
[02:12:57.640 --> 02:13:03.720]  if a plane was to be flying in, bringing in some sort of biological weapon or something.
[02:13:03.720 --> 02:13:08.880]  And of course, the project for a new American Century, when you're reading about their plans,
[02:13:08.880 --> 02:13:13.320]  that is a letter of intent in my opinion. I mean, if a school kid was to write down
[02:13:13.320 --> 02:13:20.400]  on a piece of paper that he planned on attacking the teacher or planned on shooting the principal
[02:13:20.400 --> 02:13:25.120]  and he submitted that, he'd be put in jail and banned from school.
[02:13:25.120 --> 02:13:29.120]  But when you get a group of leaders together saying that we need another new Pearl Harbor
[02:13:29.120 --> 02:13:34.960]  in order to galvanize or at least push the issue of expansion in the Middle East, I think
[02:13:34.960 --> 02:13:39.240]  that the American people need to understand that that is a letter of intent. It was a
[02:13:39.240 --> 02:13:43.400]  letter of intent from the beginning, and it certainly is a letter of intent now. And
[02:13:43.400 --> 02:13:47.520]  I think it stands to reason that anyone who sits there and tells you that you're a crank
[02:13:47.520 --> 02:13:51.280]  because you think that somebody involved in government, a criminal element or the criminal
[02:13:51.280 --> 02:13:54.560]  cabal now that we know is the deep state of the shadow government, they've been involved
[02:13:54.560 --> 02:13:59.520]  with this from the very beginning. And you see, I'm a history person. I go back and I
[02:13:59.520 --> 02:14:04.160]  dig through history and find these things, but the media won't do that. And of course,
[02:14:04.160 --> 02:14:09.040]  they'll rebuke you and they'll certainly say, well, Alex Jones thinks it's an inside job.
[02:14:09.040 --> 02:14:14.520]  Well, I think it's an inside job. It's obvious that it's an inside job. And any American
[02:14:14.520 --> 02:14:19.320]  who doesn't want to get ratcheted up in the emotion of it all has to set aside their emotions
[02:14:19.320 --> 02:14:26.680]  and understand that it is anathema. It is, in my opinion, a smack in the face to Americans
[02:14:26.680 --> 02:14:27.680]  and those who die.
[02:14:27.680 --> 02:14:31.520]  Well, Clyde, it is. I mean, I'll just tell the story briefly. I've been on air like
[02:14:31.520 --> 02:14:35.480]  nine, 10 hours that day and I was broadcasting out of my house and I was hungry. It was a
[02:14:35.480 --> 02:14:39.760]  pizza place literally a mile away. So I'm driving to get pizza and back then CBS still
[02:14:39.760 --> 02:14:44.880]  had CBS radio on 590 a.m. It turned to like Fox a month later. And I'm waiting to get
[02:14:44.880 --> 02:14:48.920]  the pizza out of the pizza place and I'm listening and they go, Solomon Brothers building
[02:14:48.920 --> 02:14:53.760]  building seven, they've put bombs in it to bring it down so won't damage other buildings.
[02:14:53.760 --> 02:14:58.440]  So I go back, get on the radio and go, CBS just announced they're going to blow up building
[02:14:58.440 --> 02:15:02.680]  seven. And then callers are going, yeah. And I run out during the room and it's on the big
[02:15:02.680 --> 02:15:07.280]  screen TV in my house. They blew it up and they go, Oh, no, it just fell when I went.
[02:15:07.280 --> 02:15:11.040]  I just heard CBS say they blew it up. And then they went, I was put years later. They
[02:15:11.040 --> 02:15:13.920]  released the archive tapes where they said that.
[02:15:13.920 --> 02:15:19.520]  Well, and here's something else that I was at a conference. It was a conspiracy conference
[02:15:19.520 --> 02:15:24.680]  in San Francisco and someone had asked me, so what are you going to do next year that
[02:15:24.680 --> 02:15:27.360]  it was, I can't remember what year it was. What are you going to do next year that's
[02:15:27.360 --> 02:15:31.160]  going to better your program? What is it that you want? What is your goal? And I says, I
[02:15:31.160 --> 02:15:35.120]  think I'm going to do an investigation into building six. And he says, you mean building
[02:15:35.120 --> 02:15:39.120]  seven. I go, no, I mean building six. And they said, why? And I said, well, if you take
[02:15:39.120 --> 02:15:42.920]  a look at the footage before I stay there, it's a cliffhanger. Yeah, let's talk about
[02:15:42.920 --> 02:15:47.360]  six. This is even bigger. Exactly. They weren't just blowing up three buildings folks. And
[02:15:47.360 --> 02:15:50.840]  again, we interviewed the head of emergency management who said there were bombs. He died
[02:15:50.840 --> 02:15:51.840]  a week after he was on.
[02:15:51.840 --> 02:15:56.800]  But he didn't really die. What is protection program? It's a no brainer. A big Berkey water

[02:20:05.360 --> 02:20:32.800]  Well, Clyde Lewis is in one of the top 10 talk show hosts in the U.S. and he's the big lead
[02:20:32.800 --> 02:20:37.600]  end of Coast to Coast Ham with George Norrie, wildly successful broadcasts on, what is it, 400
[02:20:37.600 --> 02:20:42.480]  stations? We can ask him. I know it's everywhere I listen and he's got groundzeromedia.org. He's
[02:20:42.480 --> 02:20:46.880]  a filmmaker, actor, you name it. But again, I was really impressed by his knowledge of Deep
[02:20:46.880 --> 02:20:49.840]  State. I'd forgotten a lot of the stuff he brought up and I didn't know about some of it and looked
[02:20:49.840 --> 02:20:53.760]  it up. I was like, wow, because it makes me feel good that somebody's out there that knows as much
[02:20:53.760 --> 02:21:01.280]  as I do or more, but he's dumping into 9-11, 17-year anniversary, which is good to understand how
[02:21:01.280 --> 02:21:05.840]  all this works. And then I want to get into the censorship, why he thinks the censorship
[02:21:05.840 --> 02:21:08.880]  against nationalists, conservatives, but it's happening to liberals too.
[02:21:08.880 --> 02:21:14.080]  Anybody anti-establishment is exploding, who he thinks the different power players are
[02:21:14.080 --> 02:21:17.520]  in the globe because he's a smart guy, but you were getting into 9-11, please continue.
[02:21:19.040 --> 02:21:29.760]  Well, I mean, 84% of people in the United States question the 9-11 attacks and inside job or not,
[02:21:29.760 --> 02:21:35.440]  it's an inside jab is what it is that people like you and me and others who have been doing
[02:21:35.440 --> 02:21:42.720]  the hard work to try and uncover the truth. It took $30 million to actually investigate
[02:21:42.720 --> 02:21:51.520]  the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal, $30 million. It was what, around Contra it was $35 million to
[02:21:51.520 --> 02:21:56.720]  investigate. I think it was like $12 million for the Shuttle Columbia investigation.
[02:21:56.720 --> 02:22:04.640]  $3 million was allotted to investigate the 9-11 attacks, $3 million. And then Congress had to
[02:22:04.640 --> 02:22:12.240]  ask for another $11 million to investigate. So just the idea of a pittance of $3 million
[02:22:13.520 --> 02:22:19.600]  to investigate the 9-11 attacks, I think is embarrassing for the country. And I wanted to
[02:22:19.600 --> 02:22:24.400]  kind of do something while I have the opportunity and I wanted to just kind of
[02:22:24.400 --> 02:22:31.360]  read off some names for you. I know today's a day for reading off names. And I just wanted to,
[02:22:31.360 --> 02:22:55.360]  I have them up here on my screen. I want to read them for everybody.
[02:23:01.920 --> 02:23:07.280]  Paul Wolfowitz. They've read the names of the dead today at 9-11. I've read the names responsible
[02:23:07.280 --> 02:23:12.400]  for 9-11 because they were the ones that signed their names to that project for the New American
[02:23:12.400 --> 02:23:16.880]  Century, that letter of intent where they wanted a new Pearl Harbor in order to get the American
[02:23:16.880 --> 02:23:22.400]  people involved in wanting two wars that we fought in the Middle East because of 9-11.
[02:23:22.400 --> 02:23:27.680]  They're the ones that told everybody that we should not believe outrageous conspiracy theories
[02:23:27.680 --> 02:23:35.280]  with regard to 9-11. These are the things that are, in my opinion, when Barack Obama
[02:23:35.280 --> 02:23:43.280]  became president. He had the opportunity to actually go and find these men and question them
[02:23:43.280 --> 02:23:49.120]  about their involvement and what they knew and why and how it was organized in order to bring
[02:23:49.120 --> 02:23:55.680]  us to these wars. He didn't do that. Why? Because he's just another one of those warhawk freaks
[02:23:55.680 --> 02:24:01.920]  that certainly, if you look at what happened at the John McCain funeral, every one of those people
[02:24:01.920 --> 02:24:06.640]  who spoke at the, every one of those dignitaries who spoke at the John McCain funeral were all
[02:24:06.640 --> 02:24:11.760]  the warhawks and warlords and ass kissers who've been around forever. And I knew at the minute
[02:24:11.760 --> 02:24:17.360]  that Henry Kissinger stood up. And by the way, while we're thinking of 9-11 today, think of 9-11,
[02:24:17.360 --> 02:24:23.200]  1973, where Henry Kissinger was involved with the situation in South America where they
[02:24:23.200 --> 02:24:26.000]  purged and killed many people there as well.
[02:24:28.960 --> 02:24:31.680]  You've got the floor, my friend. I want to play a clip since you mentioned it,
[02:24:32.640 --> 02:24:37.120]  of Trump a few days after 9-11 on local news. There's three different clips of this on him
[02:24:37.120 --> 02:24:41.520]  on different local TV stations talking about how there had to be bombs in the buildings,
[02:24:41.520 --> 02:24:46.000]  showing how dialed in Trump was even 17 years ago. Here it is.
[02:24:47.360 --> 02:24:52.400]  Well, I've never seen anything like it. I've seen two huge 110-story buildings that are reduced to
[02:24:52.400 --> 02:24:57.840]  rubble, thousands and thousands of lives. I just got to see something that I've never seen before.
[02:24:58.480 --> 02:25:02.480]  I have hundreds of men inside working right now, and we're bringing down another 125 in
[02:25:02.480 --> 02:25:06.880]  a little while, and they've never done work like this before. And they're hardworking people,
[02:25:06.880 --> 02:25:11.360]  but they've never seen anything like it, and they've never done work like this before. It's
[02:25:11.360 --> 02:25:16.560]  terrible. Tell me what it's like at Ground Zero. Tell me about the workers that you saw and what
[02:25:16.560 --> 02:25:21.040]  they're doing there. Well, not only is it devastation, but it's very dangerous, because every few
[02:25:21.040 --> 02:25:24.480]  minutes a whistle would go off, and everybody would just run because you have all the buildings
[02:25:24.480 --> 02:25:30.240]  around you. This is an important clip, but just stop it. Stop the clip. There are three clips of
[02:25:30.240 --> 02:25:33.600]  him talking about bombs in the buildings. We're going to play those before this hour's over,
[02:25:33.600 --> 02:25:37.680]  or I'm going to go jump off a cliff. Okay, because anybody can type into a search engine,
[02:25:37.680 --> 02:25:41.280]  Donald Trump talks about bombs in the buildings, you'll get it. That's how you get it. So we're
[02:25:41.280 --> 02:25:47.760]  going to give you that clip. Going back to Clyde Lewis of Ground Zero Media.org. Again,
[02:25:47.760 --> 02:25:52.000]  17 years later, they use it to take our liberties, our freedoms, al-Qaeda, ISIS is stronger than ever.
[02:25:53.600 --> 02:25:55.520]  Who do you think the real geopolitical players are?
[02:25:57.840 --> 02:26:02.080]  The real geopolitical players in what sense? I mean, who are the real power players in the
[02:26:02.080 --> 02:26:06.960]  world manipulating all this? Well, I would say that there are a lot of behind the scenes who
[02:26:06.960 --> 02:26:11.280]  always seem to poke their heads in. I mean, when Zvigdi Ryjewski was alive, I often pointed to him
[02:26:11.280 --> 02:26:15.680]  as one of the players. He was the guy that negotiated a lot of things with Osama bin Laden,
[02:26:15.680 --> 02:26:20.000]  of course, the Afghanistan problem. Russia all brought in other power players,
[02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:24.240]  include Henry Kissinger, who still I think dictates from where he is in his office.
[02:26:24.240 --> 02:26:27.920]  No one knows what he does. He's a war criminal and I think he needs to be brought to trial,
[02:26:27.920 --> 02:26:34.160]  but he won't be. He'll die before ever it's brought to trial. I think Dick Cheney, of course, was
[02:26:34.160 --> 02:26:39.360]  part of this more or less because his interests were involved. Donald Rumsfeld, if you look back
[02:26:39.360 --> 02:26:44.320]  at both Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney, they used to be cleanup men. They would always clean
[02:26:44.320 --> 02:26:51.840]  up the messes that the presidents had made. Of course, you see what Henry Kissinger did when
[02:26:51.840 --> 02:26:58.000]  he was involved as Secretary of State under Ford. He wanted to eliminate and starve American
[02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:02.240]  citizens and he wanted to eliminate and starve countries because of population growth. He said
[02:27:02.240 --> 02:27:07.360]  the resources would be tapped. He said, eventually, what we'd have to do is we'd have to create some
[02:27:07.360 --> 02:27:13.600]  sort of a natural problem that would give us a reason to declare famine and declare resource
[02:27:13.600 --> 02:27:17.520]  wars. And I think climate change fits that. Well, sir, Kissinger wrote that famous
[02:27:18.160 --> 02:27:22.320]  State Department of Random where he says we want to cause global famine to depopulate people.
[02:27:23.440 --> 02:27:28.480]  Yeah. I mean, he said that the only way we'd be able to convince the American people that a famine
[02:27:28.480 --> 02:27:34.240]  was here was to come up with something that would be a natural reason why this is happening.
[02:27:34.240 --> 02:27:39.840]  And I think that the climate change people, and I want to tell you this too, Alex, I mean,
[02:27:39.840 --> 02:27:45.200]  you're the first domino in effect to be censored and actually put in your place. The next people
[02:27:45.200 --> 02:27:49.280]  on board, I think, the next people to be removed from the internet are climate change deniers.
[02:27:49.280 --> 02:27:54.480]  That's what they call them. I think people who use real science instead of pseudo science and
[02:27:54.480 --> 02:28:00.240]  instead of what we call technocrat bought off science, I think those are going to be the next
[02:28:00.240 --> 02:28:04.480]  to be taken off the internet. All right. We come back with Clyde Lewis, one of the top syndicated
[02:28:04.480 --> 02:28:09.920]  hosts in the country, groundzeromedia.org versus George Norrie and Premier Radio Networks.
[02:28:09.920 --> 02:28:15.600]  When we come back, you can follow him on Twitter at Clyde Lewis. I want to play the clip. We did
[02:28:15.600 --> 02:28:19.360]  find one of the clips. Thanks for the crew on the fly finding that. It's my fault. It's throwing
[02:28:19.360 --> 02:28:22.640]  these clips off. We're going to play Trump talk about bombs in the buildings and we're going to
[02:28:22.640 --> 02:28:29.200]  finish up with 9 11 and segue 17 years later to what's happening with the media, the censorship.

[02:33:12.480 --> 02:33:28.320]  Answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:33:28.320 --> 02:33:44.720]  So here is the president, just days after 9-11 on local TV. There's three of these clips. I'm
[02:33:44.720 --> 02:33:48.800]  going to play one talking about how he knows the architect, how there were bombs in the buildings,
[02:33:48.800 --> 02:33:52.640]  which we now have local news admitting there were bombs in building seven and building six.
[02:33:52.640 --> 02:33:56.560]  We'll get Clyde Lewis, the expert on this, to comment on a moment and then move forward
[02:33:56.560 --> 02:34:01.840]  into the current situation. But here it is. It was an architectural defect. The World Trade Center
[02:34:01.840 --> 02:34:06.000]  was always known as a very, very strong building. Don't forget, that took a big bomb in the basement.
[02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:08.800]  Now, the basement is the most vulnerable place because that's your foundation.
[02:34:09.360 --> 02:34:14.880]  And it withstood that. And I got to see that area about three or four days after it took place
[02:34:14.880 --> 02:34:19.760]  because one of my structural engineers actually took me for a tour because he did the building.
[02:34:19.760 --> 02:34:24.480]  And I said, I can't believe it. The building was standing solid and half of the columns were
[02:34:24.480 --> 02:34:29.760]  blown out. I mean, so this was an unbelievably powerful building. If you know anything about
[02:34:29.760 --> 02:34:33.360]  structure, it was one of the first buildings that was built from the outside. The steel,
[02:34:33.360 --> 02:34:37.760]  the reason the World Trade Center had such narrow windows is that in between all the windows,
[02:34:37.760 --> 02:34:41.120]  you had the steel on the outside. So you had the steel on the outside of the building.
[02:34:41.120 --> 02:34:45.920]  That's why when I first looked, and you had big, heavy I-beams, when I first looked at it,
[02:34:45.920 --> 02:34:51.520]  I couldn't believe it because there was a hole in the steel. And this is steel that was, you remember
[02:34:51.520 --> 02:34:55.920]  the windows of the World Trade Center folks, I think you, you know, if you were up there,
[02:34:55.920 --> 02:35:00.800]  they were quite narrow. And in between was this heavy steel. I said, how could a plane,
[02:35:00.800 --> 02:35:07.520]  even a plane, even a 767 or 747 or whatever it might have been, how could it possibly go through
[02:35:07.520 --> 02:35:12.160]  the steel? I happen to think that they had not only a plane, but they had bombs that exploded
[02:35:12.160 --> 02:35:16.640]  almost simultaneously. Because I just can't imagine anything being able to go through that
[02:35:16.640 --> 02:35:21.200]  wall. Most buildings are built with the steel is on the inside around the elevator shaft.
[02:35:21.200 --> 02:35:24.560]  This one was built from the outside, which is the strongest structure you can have.
[02:35:25.200 --> 02:35:28.080]  And it was almost just like a, like a can of soup.
[02:35:29.520 --> 02:35:34.720]  So all I did, like everybody else, was see all this at the time. I heard CBS radio
[02:35:35.520 --> 02:35:40.000]  say that they were going to blow up seven. And then I reported it in the media, said I was
[02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:45.280]  crazy. But the years later, the audio, it's all online came out. So Clyde Lewis has been on top
[02:35:45.280 --> 02:35:50.240]  of this for a long time, syndicated talk shows on the top of the country, roundzeromedia.org.
[02:35:50.240 --> 02:35:53.840]  I want to put bookends on this and move into the future where you really blew me away with your
[02:35:53.840 --> 02:35:58.080]  knowledge, the internet kill switch and the media takeover that's happening and the final blow you
[02:35:58.080 --> 02:36:03.040]  call it, which is the term you developed, which I really resonate with in this epic time. But
[02:36:04.400 --> 02:36:08.080]  again, I don't want to be sensational. I was on over a hundred radio stations, which was a lot
[02:36:08.080 --> 02:36:15.040]  for me on 9 11 bashing Bill Clinton. I was like 27 years old, huge success, bringing in millions
[02:36:15.040 --> 02:36:18.800]  of dollars a year to build an operation. I didn't want to go on there and sit was an inside job.
[02:36:18.800 --> 02:36:24.320]  I lost 70 plus stations. I was like a hundred and something down to like, you know, 30 something.
[02:36:24.320 --> 02:36:28.800]  But I had to report what I heard. And then thank God, the internet archives got uploaded later.
[02:36:28.800 --> 02:36:32.480]  Back then there was internet archives. And there was all these newscasts saying what I'd heard.
[02:36:32.480 --> 02:36:37.040]  You heard that too. So I didn't say America did it. I was like, Oh, you say firefighters blew
[02:36:37.040 --> 02:36:41.840]  it up. No, criminal elements. We don't know what happened. We just know we're being lied to. So
[02:36:41.840 --> 02:36:46.400]  you talked about building six. That's a key part to nobody talks about. So let's finish up on 9 11.
[02:36:46.400 --> 02:36:53.360]  Clyde Lewis. Well, the reason I building six is avoided is because in the whole melee, if you
[02:36:53.360 --> 02:36:59.280]  look back at the video, the first plane entering the tower, you'll notice there's an explosion
[02:36:59.280 --> 02:37:05.680]  just halfway down from the tower that happens before the plane hits. And what that is, is that's
[02:37:05.680 --> 02:37:15.200]  building six being detonated. And I remember wondering why I was seeing explosive, at least
[02:37:15.200 --> 02:37:23.040]  some smoke coming up from the bottom of the tower. Instead of seeing it happen on the outside. But
[02:37:23.040 --> 02:37:29.520]  yeah, the minute the plane goes in or just before, in fact, it was 904 when building six blows out
[02:37:29.520 --> 02:37:35.680]  across the street. Yes, it does. If you remember the video, remember the video. And maybe for those
[02:37:35.680 --> 02:37:41.440]  of you that can go and find it online, if there is any of it left, watch the plane before it enters
[02:37:41.440 --> 02:37:47.200]  into the tower. And you will see that there's an explosion prior to the main explosion above.
[02:37:47.200 --> 02:37:53.280]  And that is building six. They exploded it. They blew it up. In fact, there was nothing left of it
[02:37:54.240 --> 02:38:02.320]  when they show the aerial view of ground zero. It was gone. And what they don't tell you about
[02:38:02.320 --> 02:38:09.280]  building six is it was actually the export import bank was in that building. And what the export
[02:38:09.280 --> 02:38:17.600]  import bank does, it basically had all of the records probably that provided the investment
[02:38:17.600 --> 02:38:23.360]  capital for the attacks on the United States. And so, you know, they run that money through
[02:38:23.360 --> 02:38:28.880]  the export import bank. And so it would have been able to trace all that money to those
[02:38:29.760 --> 02:38:33.760]  money and investments and whatever it was it took to blow up the shadow government and
[02:38:33.760 --> 02:38:39.600]  expand. Building seven had the FBI, the CIA, all they were all, yeah, yeah, there's building six.
[02:38:39.600 --> 02:38:44.640]  They were all basing that too. Say, that's the thing is that you go back to how the media
[02:38:44.640 --> 02:38:51.200]  has changed that has been forgotten since 9 11. The people involved that were the criminal element
[02:38:51.200 --> 02:38:54.960]  or at least the alleged criminal element, we can't know for sure unless we have a trial,
[02:38:54.960 --> 02:38:59.040]  but we didn't have a trial because Barack Obama wouldn't have one. Although he said he was going
[02:38:59.040 --> 02:39:05.200]  to investigate 9 11. We had, like I said, it was 30 million to invest to investigate the
[02:39:05.200 --> 02:39:09.440]  Clinton Lewinsky scandal. I mean, a state on address had more importance to the American
[02:39:09.440 --> 02:39:14.880]  people financially than the lives were lost. Exactly. How do you spend 30 million on him
[02:39:14.880 --> 02:39:21.280]  doing perverted stuff with cigars? That's the thing. It was a $30 million investigation.
[02:39:21.280 --> 02:39:24.800]  I'm sure there's more investigation going into Russian meddling. They don't tell us about the
[02:39:24.800 --> 02:39:31.440]  money that is going into these investigations and the time spent to chase after the real
[02:39:31.440 --> 02:39:35.440]  conspiracy theories. I think Mueller's up last time I heard like 80 something million.
[02:39:37.120 --> 02:39:38.560]  80 million. Yeah.
[02:39:39.840 --> 02:39:46.880]  80, 15 million actually at end for 9 11. $15 million. Okay. I mean, at first it was
[02:39:46.880 --> 02:39:52.560]  3 million, ladies and gentlemen, 3 million to investigate the dead, to investigate who was
[02:39:52.560 --> 02:39:57.360]  responsible. And by the end of the day, we knew who was responsible by some by some reason. We
[02:39:57.360 --> 02:40:03.440]  didn't investigate. Oh, they said two hours later it was Bin Laden. No, actually, they said it was
[02:40:03.440 --> 02:40:08.400]  Saddam Hussein. You're right. You're right. They said first it was Saddam Hussein. And then they
[02:40:08.400 --> 02:40:13.680]  changed their tune and said it was Osama Bin Laden because both Tom Brokaw, even Dick Cheney said
[02:40:13.680 --> 02:40:18.560]  it wasn't Osama Bin Laden. And I remember something about Donald Rohnsfeld saying that it was
[02:40:18.560 --> 02:40:25.280]  Saddam Hussein. He was the first suspect and then they eliminated that, went with the Osama Bin
[02:40:25.280 --> 02:40:29.840]  Laden story and then they found weapons of mass destruction. And then of course they had an excuse
[02:40:29.840 --> 02:40:33.360]  to go after Saddam Hussein because they wanted to expand the entire Middle East. Let's be clear.
[02:40:33.360 --> 02:40:37.600]  We're not saying Saddam's good. We're not saying Al-Qaeda's good. The point is, is just what you
[02:40:37.600 --> 02:40:41.280]  saw in the Arab Spring aiding the very groups. This was part of a larger plan.
[02:40:42.640 --> 02:40:46.640]  Well, they were the best enemies to see I could buy. They were both blowbacks. I mean, you know
[02:40:46.640 --> 02:40:51.760]  that if you go online, you can see hands being shaken for situations between Rohnsfeld, another
[02:40:51.760 --> 02:40:56.960]  cleanup situation where they're going after their biggest asset, Saddam Hussein, and using him for
[02:40:56.960 --> 02:41:03.360]  the war against Iran. And then of course, Osama Bin Laden was key in bringing down the Russians
[02:41:03.360 --> 02:41:09.040]  during that war. Of course, it's big to Brzezinski organizing that. The power players are still in
[02:41:09.040 --> 02:41:13.280]  power. They still expand on that. I was told, you can read PNAC says, oh, we're going to do the
[02:41:13.280 --> 02:41:20.560]  secure America. But then they use it to get rid of non-radicals and put in super radicals to
[02:41:20.560 --> 02:41:23.840]  collapse into Europe with the whole Islamic invasion plan. What do you think about the
[02:41:23.840 --> 02:41:29.440]  current globalist plan working with radical Islam? Well, I think it's confusing to the American
[02:41:29.440 --> 02:41:34.240]  people when you have the globalists, including John McCain before he passed away, basically
[02:41:34.240 --> 02:41:38.560]  making deals with the enemy. I mean, why, why is it all of a sudden, you know, we're working with
[02:41:38.560 --> 02:41:45.120]  the enemy because we have a big chub for Syria. It doesn't make sense to me. You know, that we are
[02:41:45.120 --> 02:41:50.480]  told, well, by the way, the enemy that was responsible for 9 11 is now fighting side by
[02:41:50.480 --> 02:41:53.680]  side with us. And we're giving them weapons. We're doing all this. And then of course,
[02:41:54.560 --> 02:42:00.880]  that's all silence now. And our hate goes to our hate goes to Donald Trump. It doesn't make any
[02:42:00.880 --> 02:42:05.200]  sense. I want to come back and get into the internet kill switch, which you really blew me away with.
[02:42:05.200 --> 02:42:09.840]  But why are they silencing everybody now? What's the big event coming the final blow?
[02:42:12.240 --> 02:42:15.680]  That's crazy. I think I know what it is. And it says so in the project for New
[02:42:15.680 --> 02:42:19.920]  American Century. It's a biological attack on the United States. I agree. Because let me tell you,
[02:42:19.920 --> 02:42:23.600]  I was on the Clyde Lewis and I'm not just saying this. People know I don't just say this. I was on
[02:42:23.600 --> 02:42:30.000]  for three hours with him from like 10 at night to one in the morning. And I literally couldn't go to
[02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:35.600]  sleep. And I was up at five o'clock in that day. I was exhausted. I couldn't go to sleep. And Clyde
[02:42:35.600 --> 02:42:38.880]  just did 9 11. That's great. He did what he wanted to do. He's got to come back in tomorrow or
[02:42:38.880 --> 02:42:44.640]  something and do what he said that night because he laid out everything. And I was getting chills
[02:42:45.280 --> 02:42:48.080]  in the middle of the night, even though I was exhausted. I was getting chills,
[02:42:48.720 --> 02:42:52.240]  chills. So I wanted to say what he gave me the chills when we come back.

[02:48:07.200 --> 02:48:12.880]  down on the internet we're still on am fm tv's exploding we've gained like 20 big stations
[02:48:12.880 --> 02:48:19.120]  last few weeks that would be announcing the next few days so good news america's awake it's upset
[02:48:19.120 --> 02:48:23.600]  sponsorships there you're supporting us speaking of that we had to end the bone broth special and
[02:48:23.600 --> 02:48:28.560]  the body's special ultimate tumor formula because the ultimate tumor formula will sell out in the
[02:48:28.560 --> 02:48:33.520]  next week so it's back to regular price won't be back until close to christmas uh or maybe next
[02:48:33.520 --> 02:48:37.760]  month if we're lucky we're trying but it's really hard to produce uh the bone broth you know that
[02:48:37.760 --> 02:48:41.920]  we had to end that special a bunch of others we have x2 that is a deep earth crystal source of
[02:48:41.920 --> 02:48:46.320]  iodine learn about the iodine conspiracy this is the best iodine but i have trouble getting it from
[02:48:46.320 --> 02:48:51.200]  the oil companies because it's it's gotten between seven and eleven thousand feet and the price has
[02:48:51.200 --> 02:48:55.760]  gone up and up and up but i've kept the price the same to you so i broke the contract the new
[02:48:55.760 --> 02:49:00.640]  contract came up i did not do it x2 the only product like it in the world is gone what we have down
[02:49:00.640 --> 02:49:05.520]  in forestore.com is yet i'm playing guts ball i got some other firms i'm looking at i'm having a
[02:49:05.520 --> 02:49:10.640]  tested we'll see what happens i've got another plan but this is amazing in forestore.com in
[02:49:10.640 --> 02:49:15.200]  forestore.com or triple eight two five three three one three nine but whatever you do we're
[02:49:15.200 --> 02:49:20.320]  under attack because we promote americana and the truth doesn't mean like i'm telling clad lewis
[02:49:20.320 --> 02:49:24.720]  i don't know what happened on 9-11 i just know i'm driving down the road cbs says they're gonna
[02:49:24.720 --> 02:49:29.520]  blow up building seven and then they blow the damn thing up and the media says i lied years later
[02:49:29.520 --> 02:49:36.560]  they released the cbs tapes and then they attacked me even more so and then the fbi comes out and says
[02:49:36.560 --> 02:49:42.880]  we're order stand down and then norad tapes are released they're like is this a drill so i appreciate
[02:49:42.880 --> 02:49:47.600]  clad coming to my defense i wanted him on about the other issue today uh but but i'm glad he brought
[02:49:47.600 --> 02:49:51.440]  this up but clad in the eight minutes we have now in five minutes after this and you got to go and
[02:49:51.440 --> 02:49:55.120]  we got paul watson coming up with the guy that they're now banning books at amazon i mean this is
[02:49:55.120 --> 02:49:58.400]  getting crazy so next time i want to speak about censorship with you and why you think it's happening
[02:49:58.400 --> 02:50:03.280]  but in three hours you notice i hardly ever shut up i'd you probably talked more than me on your
[02:50:03.280 --> 02:50:08.240]  own show because you were on fire that night give us some of that fire what you said because i've got
[02:50:09.040 --> 02:50:13.200]  all the articles that back up what you say about the shadow government to stay behind
[02:50:13.200 --> 02:50:18.080]  grips we know there's groups rebelling against trump not doing what he says who's behind it
[02:50:18.080 --> 02:50:24.320]  how it got set up by obama break that down well back in 2015 i made the comment that there were some
[02:50:24.880 --> 02:50:29.520]  movements being made that were mimicking what i would call the dirty war that happened in
[02:50:29.520 --> 02:50:36.080]  argentina was a uh a similar thing that happened like it started in 1973 on 9 11 where uh journalists
[02:50:36.080 --> 02:50:40.240]  actors comedians musicians they were all silenced through methods of intimidation character
[02:50:40.240 --> 02:50:45.040]  assassination suspicious deaths and uh when i made this statement there were a lot of people
[02:50:45.040 --> 02:50:50.400]  that were leaving late night talk john stewart david letterman uh everybody was just leaving
[02:50:50.400 --> 02:50:56.080]  and they were opening up for the new uh ones to take over you know uh you know jimmy fowland
[02:50:56.080 --> 02:51:01.840]  steam cobert uh kimmel all of them pretty much liberal and they and they wanted to take uh over
[02:51:02.400 --> 02:51:06.960]  i'd forgotten that there was a giant exos and they said i no longer have creative control
[02:51:06.960 --> 02:51:12.000]  that was the beginning so they left yeah they were losing creative control of their shows
[02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:16.080]  they knew what was going on something was moving in and then of course eric holder said
[02:51:16.080 --> 02:51:20.240]  well you know we're not yet in a time of war but we're going to issue a statement in something
[02:51:20.240 --> 02:51:24.160]  called the department of defense law of war manual and what we're going to talk about is
[02:51:24.160 --> 02:51:30.080]  unprivileged belligerence which is probably the uh equivalent of a enemy combatant and we're going
[02:51:30.080 --> 02:51:36.640]  to go in and we're going to basically uh evaluate who are the spokespeople on the internet who are
[02:51:36.640 --> 02:51:42.560]  the spokespeople who are in newsrooms and what they wanted to do is they uh wanted to actually
[02:51:42.560 --> 02:51:45.840]  put together something called the multi-market study of critical information needs and what
[02:51:45.840 --> 02:51:50.640]  that was is they were going to go into newsrooms and they were going to ferret out those who were
[02:51:50.640 --> 02:51:56.400]  controversial who are the heavy hitters who wanted to basically upset the apple car if you will with
[02:51:56.400 --> 02:52:02.640]  information that was going against what the mainstream framing was about using hypocognition
[02:52:02.640 --> 02:52:06.400]  going in and saying well we're going to exclude certain things exclude certain people we're not
[02:52:06.400 --> 02:52:10.960]  going to pay attention to certain people and so during the obama administration the FCC created
[02:52:10.960 --> 02:52:17.360]  this c i n uh the purpose of the c i n according to the FCC was to ferret out information from
[02:52:17.360 --> 02:52:21.760]  television and radio broadcasters about the process by which stories are selected and
[02:52:21.760 --> 02:52:26.880]  how often stations cover critical information needs along with perceived station bias to
[02:52:26.880 --> 02:52:32.800]  proceed responsiveness to undeserved populations what they were saying is uh is there enough
[02:52:32.800 --> 02:52:37.360]  media coverage on minorities is there enough media coverage on immigration is enough media
[02:52:37.360 --> 02:52:42.080]  coverage on all these things and so they'll only stop you when they had jade helman claimed that
[02:52:42.080 --> 02:52:45.600]  i said there was going to be a huge invasion i never said that but jade helman later admitted
[02:52:45.600 --> 02:52:49.920]  was about controlling the human domain and practicing taking over social media by the
[02:52:49.920 --> 02:52:56.400]  pentagon by obama yeah it was it was a way to take over social media and take over the internet
[02:52:56.400 --> 02:53:00.160]  and in order to use it as a weapon that was the whole idea is they wanted to use as a weapon
[02:53:00.160 --> 02:53:06.240]  controlling the human domain exactly and the human domain was certainly on social networks
[02:53:06.240 --> 02:53:11.120]  and shaping controlling the human domain was basically shaping the culture that's what they
[02:53:11.120 --> 02:53:15.760]  wanted to do is the idea of shaping the culture and preparing them as i say for the final blow
[02:53:15.760 --> 02:53:21.680]  preparing them for the moment where there will be a complete rebellion or those who will be
[02:53:21.680 --> 02:53:26.960]  fighting against the rebellion will be silenced and so uh and notice our videos on that have been
[02:53:26.960 --> 02:53:31.120]  killed by youtube i'm just showing this now i've talked to special operations folks at fort bragg
[02:53:31.120 --> 02:53:35.920]  the good news is they're aware of this now and it's kind of backfired but i want to speak to
[02:53:35.920 --> 02:53:42.160]  you briefly about that because the good news is there's a rebellion do you agree with that well
[02:53:42.160 --> 02:53:47.440]  yeah i mean there's a rebellion uh with uh those of us who are seeing what is going on i mean the
[02:53:47.440 --> 02:53:53.840]  media cannot say that they are objective when they most certainly say that they're part of the
[02:53:53.840 --> 02:53:58.960]  resistance you can't do that you can't say that you are uh objective you can't say that you're
[02:53:58.960 --> 02:54:03.280]  balanced and buy it and unbiased when you know that the resistance is fueling you and the money
[02:54:03.280 --> 02:54:08.000]  that's uh with the resistance is is fueling you and so you know when you're looking at twitter
[02:54:08.000 --> 02:54:13.280]  platforms and you're looking at uh facebook platforms they say oh we removed alex jones because
[02:54:13.280 --> 02:54:18.880]  he violated our terms of service what they're really saying is is that the government was already
[02:54:18.880 --> 02:54:24.240]  planning on going after people who are trying to tell the truth and what i say is that they 451
[02:54:24.240 --> 02:54:33.280]  do you alex meaning that it was like fahrenheit 451 where the people pretended to police you and with
[02:54:33.280 --> 02:54:38.720]  the media pushing the issue that you're a weirdo whack job or whatever they're saying about you or
[02:54:38.720 --> 02:54:43.920]  you're heartless because of sandy hook or because you believe that 9 11 is an inside job all those
[02:54:43.920 --> 02:54:49.360]  things are there to destroy your character and erase you much like what they did in the times of
[02:54:49.360 --> 02:54:54.640]  russia the soviet union that's right so it's an unpersoning so let me let me ask this question then
[02:54:54.640 --> 02:54:57.760]  what do we do about it because i believe sandy hook happened i've always said i had guessed on like
[02:54:57.760 --> 02:55:01.600]  you did the question i played devil's advocate said both sides they clipped the tape but even
[02:55:01.600 --> 02:55:07.440]  if i believe that i have a right what so so trump comes in hillary loses but the deep state just
[02:55:07.440 --> 02:55:13.040]  continued her plan that's what we've learned what does trump do to counter that well i mean what
[02:55:13.040 --> 02:55:19.760]  trump has to do is he has to go in and he has to say and he has to be point blank saying we obviously
[02:55:19.760 --> 02:55:26.080]  have a group of individuals that are part of the resistance within the walls of the white house
[02:55:26.080 --> 02:55:30.960]  this is a silent soft coup and it's happening and i need to do things to protect myself and
[02:55:30.960 --> 02:55:36.000]  to protect this country and protect the white house i mean people like vaccine waters saying
[02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:40.800]  impeach impeach impeach and harass and all this you know if trump wanted to be nasty
[02:55:40.800 --> 02:55:45.680]  which he hasn't been he could basically pull the woodrow wilson on everybody and then basically
[02:55:45.680 --> 02:55:51.920]  put in sedition laws in fact if i was a president i may i probably would think about and by the way
[02:55:51.920 --> 02:55:57.600]  you're a classical liberal like i am these are foreign outside powers the pentagon google work
[02:55:57.600 --> 02:56:01.520]  with the pentagon but they'll work with chinese military exactly this is a foreign globalist
[02:56:01.520 --> 02:56:06.880]  plan the right response would be the sedition act because this isn't citizens this is an outside
[02:56:06.880 --> 02:56:12.320]  group trying to overthrow our republic yes and it's the chinese model they want to implement
[02:56:12.320 --> 02:56:17.600]  by 2030 it's the u.s plan they set us the u.s plan for the very beginning changing ping said
[02:56:17.600 --> 02:56:22.800]  it is last uh uh what was the meeting they had they said that our model of government is the
[02:56:22.800 --> 02:56:27.600]  model of government with the internet of things 5g all these things coming our way and you look at
[02:56:27.600 --> 02:56:32.800]  what china's doing in the movie they set up sky net they call it sky net surveilling everyone in real
[02:56:32.800 --> 02:56:40.240]  time yeah and and what after you got thrown off the internet what happened uh facebook said well
[02:56:40.240 --> 02:56:44.960]  we've got a social uh we have a social credit network that no one knows about and we also
[02:56:44.960 --> 02:56:49.040]  have a hate scale that no one knows about just like what they have in china i mean they they have
[02:56:49.040 --> 02:56:56.880]  the social uh oh zuckerberg went to china last year to learn how to do it yes yeah i mean it's
[02:56:56.880 --> 02:57:01.040]  all being implemented everything that china has we're getting and we're eventually gonna have that
[02:57:01.040 --> 02:57:07.040]  and no we don't need the chinese to come with guns and taking over our country they're economically
[02:57:07.040 --> 02:57:11.040]  taking over the culture you're on you're on fire stay there and come back and talk about this and

[03:00:34.720 --> 03:00:40.880]  of ground zero media dot org they're making their move 56 days out they're shutting down everybody
[03:00:40.880 --> 03:00:45.840]  mainland conservatives real liberals anybody that's independent what do you think's happening
[03:00:45.840 --> 03:00:53.280]  what does trump need to do well what i think is happening is that the globalists have this ideal
[03:00:53.920 --> 03:01:00.160]  and the ideal was set in stone during the 2030 summit when jasu keng with the un who was one of the
[03:01:01.360 --> 03:01:08.240]  redesigners of state socialism in china spoke and said that this model would be used for smart
[03:01:08.240 --> 03:01:12.640]  cities and the future and they wanted to implement by 2030 they said it was a political move that
[03:01:12.640 --> 03:01:17.680]  would be very very dangerous that people would if they had any idea what was going on that would
[03:01:17.680 --> 03:01:26.480]  rise up well the rising up was being taken down by these provisions that were put in play by
[03:01:26.480 --> 03:01:32.240]  eric holder and barack obama and i think they did it because they were of the opinion that
[03:01:32.240 --> 03:01:38.720]  their globalist patsy or their globalist uh hillary clinton would end up being president of the
[03:01:38.720 --> 03:01:42.480]  united states they signed everything to law hoping that the next president would be part of this
[03:01:42.480 --> 03:01:49.360]  global agenda the globalists made themselves obviously uh known during the mccain campaign
[03:01:49.360 --> 03:01:54.640]  i think president trump needs to put up parameters and protect himself i think even though it looked
[03:01:54.640 --> 03:01:59.280]  like a narcissistic move on his part to protect himself i feel he needs to be protected and he
[03:01:59.280 --> 03:02:04.720]  needs to start putting things in place to protect him to protect the administration and to also weed
[03:02:04.720 --> 03:02:10.720]  out and investigate and have his own investigation as to who the leakers are as uh who are the uh
[03:02:10.720 --> 03:02:17.040]  the conspirators are because there is a conspiracy i mean the whole idea of conspiracy theory is uh
[03:02:17.040 --> 03:02:21.600]  you know right it's it's theory until proven otherwise but there's always been a conspiracy
[03:02:21.600 --> 03:02:26.320]  from the very beginning our founding fathers were conspirators against the king and we need to remember
[03:02:26.320 --> 03:02:30.960]  that there always been conspirators you know i agree so let me ask you this question because i'm
[03:02:30.960 --> 03:02:33.600]  going to give this whole interview a headline i'm going to put it out i'm going to try to push it
[03:02:33.600 --> 03:02:37.440]  everywhere i'm asking listeners to get it out it's very powerful what you're saying what do we call
[03:02:37.440 --> 03:02:42.640]  this interview because the first parts i guess the first parts 9 11 but the last 20 minutes or so
[03:02:42.640 --> 03:02:47.280]  we're breaking down the plan to take down america china running world government what do we call this
[03:02:48.960 --> 03:02:55.200]  oh man uh i don't know what we call it we we basically call it the conspiracy to tear down
[03:02:55.200 --> 03:03:00.720]  america and it's been that way since 9 11 it's the controlled demolition of america it's exactly
[03:03:00.720 --> 03:03:07.040]  what it is when the control demolition happened in new york uh on september 11th 2001 we saw not
[03:03:07.040 --> 03:03:10.960]  only the controlled demolition of buildings but we saw the controlled demolition of our country
[03:03:10.960 --> 03:03:16.640]  that's right they used the fear to take control but it wasn't about protecting us and the american
[03:03:16.640 --> 03:03:21.360]  system just as the king england said 240 years ago they said the american system can't exist or
[03:03:21.360 --> 03:03:26.480]  our imperial system will fail that's why all the authoritarians are advertising at davos the chinese
[03:03:26.480 --> 03:03:33.520]  communist system because america competes with that yeah uh and that's the that's the situation is
[03:03:33.520 --> 03:03:40.560]  that if you want to if we want to involve ourselves on the world stage it will have to be uh it's
[03:03:40.560 --> 03:03:47.840]  sort of i think compromising with socialism the socialism uh the socialism bias and the
[03:03:47.840 --> 03:03:52.480]  idea of socialism was put on the table after 9 11 and it was always brought up but always
[03:03:52.480 --> 03:03:58.480]  sequestered always put to sleep but now it's powerful the resistance is powerful the media
[03:03:58.480 --> 03:04:03.920]  is the resistance the main street no i agree the gut level do you think trump survives
[03:04:06.240 --> 03:04:15.520]  no and that's sad but no i think in current moves they're planning to take him out i think it's
[03:04:15.520 --> 03:04:21.200]  up to us to get involved and change destiny but i agree right now i feel like ever since health
[03:04:21.200 --> 03:04:25.520]  sinky they were planning it i think i think that when you have a guy from greenpeace flying over
[03:04:25.520 --> 03:04:30.720]  the golf course when you have one of his cia agents that fell ill and died when they were using
[03:04:30.720 --> 03:04:35.920]  weapons like they did on the uh the cuban uh the diplomats american diplomats and cuban microwave
[03:04:35.920 --> 03:04:41.120]  weapons in china the microwaves i have a feeling that you know you you be little by little they
[03:04:41.120 --> 03:04:45.760]  can break him down i was about to say they're using chinese operatives against america the deep
[03:04:45.760 --> 03:04:50.160]  state is flight louis very impressive uh ground zero minute dot org please come on next week we'll

[03:07:18.560 --> 03:07:23.840]  liners next week 20 plus stations that i'm going to cut liners for them to be announcing here i mean
[03:07:23.840 --> 03:07:34.800]  we're talking just in california san francisco and sacramento and i mean it's amazing so and and
[03:07:34.800 --> 03:07:40.320]  stations in louisiana mississippi and florida and new york and illinois and texas and i mean
[03:07:40.320 --> 03:07:48.560]  we're talking number one stations it's it's on like donkey kong people really get it and they
[03:07:48.560 --> 03:07:52.880]  really understand it and if you're a local listener in local stations i'm censored all over facebook
[03:07:52.880 --> 03:07:59.120]  twitter youtube but those stations feeds aren't so you can grab that feed and share that everywhere
[03:07:59.120 --> 03:08:06.080]  and their ai isn't picking up on it so that's a critical shank of the enemy's armor now that said
[03:08:06.080 --> 03:08:15.360]  the washington post came out and said the traffic info war store dot com is up 50 percent since we
[03:08:15.360 --> 03:08:20.480]  banned him five weeks ago yeah and i already told you that they got major universities with
[03:08:20.480 --> 03:08:25.440]  its and the and and and and democratic party cia groups it's admitted there's a washington post
[03:08:25.440 --> 03:08:31.520]  article watching everything and tracking everything but i would just give you the numbers if you
[03:08:31.520 --> 03:08:40.800]  just ask we're up financially 10 from last year in this last month but we were down six months
[03:08:41.440 --> 03:08:47.280]  from last year so i i'm i'm i'm i'm not in expansion mode i'm under total attack everybody
[03:08:47.280 --> 03:08:52.480]  knows it i'm trying to expand capital will fix a lot of our problems plus i make it easy
[03:08:53.920 --> 03:08:58.880]  but you notice they have the major universities the cia the washington post all in an article
[03:08:58.880 --> 03:09:03.920]  saying they're scanning our site and we're up 50 what did i tell you a couple weeks ago
[03:09:07.840 --> 03:09:12.800]  traffic to the website tripled the first couple days went down to double and now it's six seven
[03:09:12.800 --> 03:09:17.680]  eight percent higher and over all the last five weeks the shopping cart's got 50 percent increase
[03:09:17.680 --> 03:09:22.240]  in traffic but oh the washington post says it but now that's one of the only few things they
[03:09:22.240 --> 03:09:30.000]  say true in there they're like jones in the new york times jones bought four rolexes in one day
[03:09:30.000 --> 03:09:36.720]  his divorce paper show gee wonder who gave us to you yeah that's right i had an employee give me
[03:09:36.720 --> 03:09:41.440]  my first rolex when i was getting divorced this american watch and we're in a tag that one of my
[03:09:41.440 --> 03:09:49.120]  crew gave me i'm all about free market but i don't sell out for money and so i was had a girlfriend
[03:09:49.120 --> 03:09:54.720]  who i married i and i went to the rolex store to buy tim fruget who'd been working 20 hours a day
[03:09:55.360 --> 03:10:02.000]  and had not had a pay raise in three years and i said i'm gonna buy him a rolex and i did buy
[03:10:02.000 --> 03:10:07.760]  my wife one soon to be wife and then i bought my cousin one and i bought rob do one but that's
[03:10:07.760 --> 03:10:11.440]  how they spend it yeah i bought them all seven thousand dollar rolexes damn right i did because
[03:10:11.440 --> 03:10:15.680]  i noticed bonuses aren't the same as a watch where somebody knows how much you care about them
[03:10:16.400 --> 03:10:20.880]  but that's the type of we're not against people having wealth we're not against people having success
[03:10:22.800 --> 03:10:27.840]  you know i'm wearing a three thousand dollar watch right now why frankly i had somebody give me
[03:10:27.840 --> 03:10:33.600]  a listener a thirty five thousand dollar rolex three years ago you know what i did with that
[03:10:33.600 --> 03:10:39.520]  thirty five thousand dollar rolex i took it and i sold it and i put it into this operation
[03:10:41.040 --> 03:10:46.240]  but that's how they play these games you know i love this because tim gave me this watch three
[03:10:46.240 --> 03:10:52.080]  thousand dollars he bought it on a trip with his wife to vegas because i told him i really like your
[03:10:52.080 --> 03:10:56.000]  watch and he bought me this is the watch i wear now because this is my favorite i'm not doing an
[03:10:56.000 --> 03:11:01.040]  advert tag this sucker's lightweight awesome keeps great time this is the watch i wear now
[03:11:01.040 --> 03:11:08.400]  not not the not the rolex i sold but imagine bezos owns the washington post he's worth a hundred
[03:11:08.400 --> 03:11:14.480]  and seventy billion dollars last time i checked he doesn't pay taxes i pay 40 federal taxes
[03:11:14.480 --> 03:11:19.840]  i'm not a rich powerful globalist i'm trying to expand against these people and they're demonizing
[03:11:19.840 --> 03:11:25.200]  and attacking me like i'm a bad guy because i sell supplements okay it's 159 billion right now
[03:11:25.200 --> 03:11:31.680]  these people are sick so again when you fund us we're able to expand in their face if i have to
[03:11:31.680 --> 03:11:36.720]  sell my house to fund this operation that could come in the future i'll do it only fund us a few
[03:11:36.720 --> 03:11:43.040]  months though so info or store dot com in four's live dot com and we've got x2 we've had up for five
[03:11:43.040 --> 03:11:51.120]  plus years that is the only deuth birth crystal source of iodine it's so amazing and the oil
[03:11:51.120 --> 03:11:54.880]  companies that drill it out of the crystals at 12 000 feet or trumpet over barrel so i broke the
[03:11:54.880 --> 03:11:59.040]  contract it's gone we may get another one it may come back but that'll take six months to a year
[03:11:59.040 --> 03:12:02.880]  to get rolling so x2 this is the final x2 it'll probably have a new name when it comes out
[03:12:06.320 --> 03:12:10.720]  i've discounted 25 percent even though there's a run on it info or store dot com info or is
[03:12:10.720 --> 03:12:15.200]  live dot com for triple a two five three three one three nine all right paul watchin takes over he's
[03:12:15.200 --> 03:12:19.520]  got a big guest a lot of folks are getting banned off amazon but this is one of the first big guys
[03:12:19.520 --> 03:12:25.040]  they did to officially nine books in one day but paul what would you call this epic time rebellion
[03:12:25.040 --> 03:12:31.200]  in the white house deep state kush crazy town going on massive censorship uh the left throwing
[03:12:31.200 --> 03:12:36.000]  a temper tantrum nationalist winning everywhere this is the unstoppable force runs into the
[03:12:36.000 --> 03:12:42.000]  immovable object paul joseph watchin take over thanks alex yeah i would call it the age of
[03:12:42.000 --> 03:12:48.720]  hysteria i mean i just tweeted something earlier from an lgbtq plus account if they've got enough
[03:12:48.720 --> 03:12:52.640]  of the letters that's probably a hate crime if they forgot and left out one of them linked to a
[03:12:52.640 --> 03:12:59.040]  major university in london literally tweeting that people should be put in a gulag and that
[03:12:59.040 --> 03:13:04.000]  thought criminals who are putting a gulag for being bigots that is compassionate that is a
[03:13:04.000 --> 03:13:10.160]  nonviolent course of action to put people with whom you disagree in a gulag literally with that
[03:13:10.160 --> 03:13:15.440]  we're at that level now where they've just embraced total totalitarianism and it truly
[03:13:15.440 --> 03:13:21.520]  is the age of hysteria as he said at the bottom of the hour we've got ruch v coming up and to get
[03:13:21.520 --> 03:13:26.320]  out in advance of all the idiots who are going to say the most predictable things ever yes we
[03:13:26.320 --> 03:13:32.080]  know that ruch v is a controversial person we know that he said offensive things in the past
[03:13:32.080 --> 03:13:37.120]  we know that people like sarah jung have said very offensive things in the past james gone peter
[03:13:37.120 --> 03:13:42.800]  fonder literally tweeting tweeting about locking up baron trump in a cage with peter files does he
[03:13:42.800 --> 03:13:48.640]  get his commerce withdrawn does he get his right to live and make money withdrawn no he doesn't and
[03:13:48.640 --> 03:13:54.240]  i don't think he should either because everybody's offended by something so you either support free
[03:13:54.240 --> 03:14:00.080]  speech or you don't if you don't support offensive free speech you don't support free speech because
[03:14:00.080 --> 03:14:07.280]  everything's offensive to someone so i'm absolutely sick of this non-argument well what about newsday
[03:14:07.280 --> 03:14:12.080]  calling for me to be murdered by being stabbed in the throat oh that's trendy that's tolerant that's
[03:14:12.080 --> 03:14:18.080]  fine i'm just sick of people completely losing grasp of this what was it like 60 of college
[03:14:18.080 --> 03:14:23.040]  students now barely even know what the first amendment is offensive speech is part of free
[03:14:23.040 --> 03:14:29.760]  speech the supreme court said it i mean this is so simple and paul i'm gonna let you take over
[03:14:29.760 --> 03:14:33.680]  you're on fire here but they're making their move that's my question to you then you take over
[03:14:33.680 --> 03:14:37.760]  they don't care they're making a authoritarian move now they're banning books what do you think
[03:14:37.760 --> 03:14:44.000]  they're planning next i think violence well probably i mean we've talked about the threats to
[03:14:44.000 --> 03:14:48.320]  trump there's been tweets threatening the assassination of trump on twitter these people
[03:14:48.320 --> 03:14:52.960]  don't only still have accounts they're verified this goes back to a media matters plan most people
[03:14:52.960 --> 03:14:59.200]  don't know this from january 2017 where they said they would become partners with social media
[03:14:59.200 --> 03:15:04.800]  organizations because conservatives had weaponized them during the election campaign in other words
[03:15:04.800 --> 03:15:10.640]  conservatives have finally used had learned how to use them and had success so it goes back to that
[03:15:10.640 --> 03:15:16.080]  they said they secured access to raw data from facebook twitter and other social media sites
[03:15:16.080 --> 03:15:22.080]  and that they were going to partner with these social media sites to eliminate the most destructive
[03:15:22.080 --> 03:15:28.400]  forces and quote fake news that's the raft on which they introduced this tyranny people need
[03:15:28.400 --> 03:15:32.640]  to go back to that document and look at it they had a four-year plan to get rid of trump
[03:15:32.640 --> 03:15:38.960]  the first step the major step was getting his most prominent supporters banned on social media
[03:15:38.960 --> 03:15:43.920]  now it's happening basically every day we're going to get more into it on the next side

[03:20:15.200 --> 03:20:24.320]  host paul joseph watkins go back on the fourth hour of the most banned-sensitive broadcast in
[03:20:24.320 --> 03:20:28.480]  the known universe and at the bottom of the hour we're going to go to ruche v to talk about how
[03:20:28.480 --> 03:20:34.800]  he's been basically de-platformed by the book burning gnats he's at amazon.com first of all
[03:20:34.800 --> 03:20:38.800]  going to talk about this this was an article that was up on info wars dot com yesterday
[03:20:38.800 --> 03:20:43.360]  we've got a video to go along with this here in a second uk police tells citizens to report
[03:20:43.360 --> 03:20:49.520]  offensive comments even if they're not hate crimes they literally put out a tweet telling people
[03:20:49.520 --> 03:20:54.000]  this is south yorkshire police this is where i used to live in sheffield it covers that area
[03:20:54.000 --> 03:20:59.520]  they said in addition to reporting hate crime please report non-crime hate incidents which
[03:20:59.520 --> 03:21:04.560]  can include include things like offensive or insulting comments online in person or in writing
[03:21:04.560 --> 03:21:09.440]  hate will not be tolerated in south yorkshire report it and put a stop to it have you ever
[03:21:09.440 --> 03:21:16.000]  seen 1984 i rewatched 1984 with john hurt the other day literally the kids tattle tailing on
[03:21:16.000 --> 03:21:20.560]  their parents because they said something that might have been offensive to the state now the
[03:21:20.560 --> 03:21:27.360]  police in this area of the uk are telling people to phone them up if they're offended by something
[03:21:27.360 --> 03:21:32.720]  even if it's not a hate crime obviously our hate crime definitions in the uk way stronger than in
[03:21:32.720 --> 03:21:38.720]  america but they said even if it's obviously not a crime tell us anyway because then after we've
[03:21:38.720 --> 03:21:44.800]  investigated it it might escalate to the level of a crime meanwhile in the same area of the
[03:21:44.800 --> 03:21:52.320]  country violent crime in south yorkshire up nearly 60 percent well what a surprise that is
[03:21:52.320 --> 03:21:57.360]  they're wasting precious police resources left constantly claims about how the police don't
[03:21:57.360 --> 03:22:04.720]  get enough resources and they have a 60 increase in crime in actual violent crime in this region
[03:22:04.720 --> 03:22:09.280]  meanwhile they're telling people to report offensive comments on the internet do you see
[03:22:09.280 --> 03:22:17.600]  the disconnect there this is the same police organization that is under 98 separate investigations
[03:22:17.600 --> 03:22:23.440]  into their response lack thereof or basically cover up in some cases to the grooming gang
[03:22:23.440 --> 03:22:29.680]  scandal in rather you remember that thousands of girls trafficked by muslim grooming gangs the
[03:22:29.680 --> 03:22:34.160]  police turned a blind eye to it the council helped cover it up because they didn't want to be called
[03:22:34.160 --> 03:22:40.640]  racist there so there are 98 separate investigations into potential misconduct by police officers
[03:22:40.640 --> 03:22:47.200]  in this area and they're telling people to report offensive tweets absolutely incredible
[03:22:47.920 --> 03:22:53.360]  we have a situation in the united kingdom where only nine percent of crimes end with suspects
[03:22:53.360 --> 03:22:59.920]  being charged or summoned only nine percent we've got police forces in some areas of the country
[03:22:59.920 --> 03:23:05.760]  telling citizens that they will stop investigating quote low-level crimes like shoplifting car
[03:23:05.760 --> 03:23:11.040]  crime and criminal damage due to budget cuts oh but there's plenty of room in the budget
[03:23:11.600 --> 03:23:17.120]  to go and knock on somebody's door if they said something mean on the internet which isn't even
[03:23:17.120 --> 03:23:25.200]  a crime absolutely ludicrous situation and today they had one of the police commissioners from that
[03:23:25.200 --> 03:23:31.360]  body on a radio show and it got only more ludicrous and absurd let's go to this clip now here it is
[03:23:32.240 --> 03:23:38.640]  recorded crime has risen 30 compared with a national rise of 21 including a very very serious
[03:23:38.640 --> 03:23:43.520]  violent crime i'm i'm sure some people's feelings are hurt but is that a top priority for the
[03:23:43.520 --> 03:23:48.960]  police i was at a meeting yesterday in uh in the winter gardens in cheville city center where we
[03:23:48.960 --> 03:23:54.000]  were looking at knife crime and we'd gather together people from different communities now some of
[03:23:54.000 --> 03:23:59.600]  those were people from different ethnic minority communities the precisely the sort of people who
[03:23:59.600 --> 03:24:04.400]  were deeply affected by the incident that happened on saturday and the i think the people who were
[03:24:04.400 --> 03:24:08.000]  most affected by the incident on saturday with the people who were terrified to have their wits
[03:24:08.000 --> 03:24:13.520]  when some a six-foot woman ran through the town shouting kill kill kill with a large knife in her
[03:24:13.520 --> 03:24:18.480]  hand no you're absolutely wrong partly because i suppose i'm wrong well you're wrong in the sense
[03:24:18.480 --> 03:24:24.000]  that it wasn't only those people those people were affected no i said the people who are most you're
[03:24:24.000 --> 03:24:30.080]  telling me that someone who got someone who saw a nasty tweet the day after an instant in which
[03:24:30.080 --> 03:24:35.200]  someone ran down the street shouting kill kill kill in the middle of the city and you're saying that
[03:24:35.200 --> 03:24:41.040]  well no their feelings may want to be hurt just as much no i'm saying to you that on saturday
[03:24:41.040 --> 03:24:45.280]  when that incident happened there are a lot of people affected market traders people who are
[03:24:45.280 --> 03:24:49.040]  shopping in the town center people who are passing by they were deeply affected by that
[03:24:49.600 --> 03:24:55.680]  also because of the vile racist comments that were put on social media and elsewhere and the
[03:24:55.680 --> 03:25:00.240]  rumors that ran around other people were affected as well well beyond the town center and that
[03:25:00.240 --> 03:25:09.520]  included some people from ethnic minority groups you've got a laugh otherwise you'd cry what they're
[03:25:09.520 --> 03:25:14.000]  referring to is an incident in a town called barnsley which is in south yorkshire the same area
[03:25:14.000 --> 03:25:20.080]  covered by this police force where a six foot muslim woman in a hijab was running through the
[03:25:20.080 --> 03:25:26.240]  town center with a large knife shouting kill kill kill non-terror related they later told us of
[03:25:26.240 --> 03:25:31.280]  course of course it would be so they literally had a muslim woman in a hijab running through the town
[03:25:31.280 --> 03:25:36.720]  center threatening to kill people with a foot long machete it wasn't even knife it was a foot
[03:25:36.720 --> 03:25:43.680]  long machete traumatizing people luckily i don't think anyone was seriously injured and the police
[03:25:43.680 --> 03:25:49.920]  responded by saying of equal importance to that attempted attack attempted butchery of people in
[03:25:49.920 --> 03:25:56.000]  this south yorkshire town was mean tweets and comments on the internet in the 24 hours after
[03:25:56.560 --> 03:26:02.000]  about muslims and they that that's what he literally just said was that those people are
[03:26:02.000 --> 03:26:08.880]  equally as traumatized as the people who are faced with this six foot woman screaming insane
[03:26:08.880 --> 03:26:14.160]  running towards them with a machete on a saturday afternoon when they're trying to do their shopping
[03:26:15.040 --> 03:26:20.800]  this is the state of political correctness in the uk this is the same police force that covered up
[03:26:20.800 --> 03:26:27.920]  that turned a blind eye to actual grooming of children in this area for years and years and
[03:26:27.920 --> 03:26:32.720]  years this is the same police force that has overseen situation where violent crime in the
[03:26:32.720 --> 03:26:39.200]  area is up nearly 60 percent in one year with violent offenses soaring by almost 60 percent
[03:26:39.200 --> 03:26:47.760]  stalking and harassment reports increased by 158 percent in this region sexual offenses were up by
[03:26:47.760 --> 03:26:53.360]  24 percent robbery increased by 30 percent now we've got a violent crime problem in the uk but
[03:26:53.360 --> 03:26:59.920]  these figures literally double or more the rest of the country so in in this area of the country
[03:26:59.920 --> 03:27:06.000]  it's twice as bad the harassment the violent crimes the sexual assaults the attacks and
[03:27:06.000 --> 03:27:12.240]  they've got a police commissioner telling everyone on the radio that the people traumatized by that
[03:27:12.240 --> 03:27:19.520]  the people impacted by that are only equally as important as the ethnic minorities traumatized
[03:27:19.520 --> 03:27:25.200]  and impacted by mean comments on the internet which they probably didn't even read like these
[03:27:25.200 --> 03:27:29.680]  comments are probably being reported by idiot white leftists on the internet they're probably
[03:27:29.680 --> 03:27:35.600]  not even being read by an ethnic minority that would be offended by them we have a situation in
[03:27:35.600 --> 03:27:44.320]  the uk where 3 000 people are arrested every single year for basically mean tweets mean comments on
[03:27:44.320 --> 03:27:51.120]  facebook this is 127 of the communications act 2003 which makes it illegal to intentionally
[03:27:51.120 --> 03:27:56.800]  quote cause annoyance inconvenience or needless anxiety to another which of course is completely
[03:27:56.800 --> 03:28:03.200]  broad could be completely misinterpreted and completely abused which it is so the police
[03:28:03.200 --> 03:28:10.160]  are literally telling people to report things that aren't crimes to them things which amount to
[03:28:10.160 --> 03:28:16.240]  nothing more than mean words on the internet boohoo meanwhile terrorists oh but it wasn't
[03:28:16.240 --> 03:28:20.400]  terrorists so they tell us and you can trust them they're only under 98 different investigations
[03:28:20.400 --> 03:28:27.840]  into police misconduct they've got a great record you can trust them you've got machete women literally
[03:28:27.840 --> 03:28:33.600]  running through the street with headscarves shouting kill kill kill attempting to stab people
[03:28:33.600 --> 03:28:40.000]  and south yorkshire police are more concerned it seems from what he said about mean comments online
[03:28:40.000 --> 03:28:47.760]  and prosecuting things which they admit are not even crimes absolutely kafka s or welly in situation
[03:28:47.760 --> 03:28:52.560]  it only seems to be getting worse we'll be right back this is the info wars alex germshaw live

[03:32:57.420 --> 03:33:11.140]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:33:11.140 --> 03:33:20.460]  You found it the tip of the spear, it is the Alex Jones show and now your host, Paul Joseph
[03:33:20.460 --> 03:33:21.460]  Watson.
[03:33:21.460 --> 03:33:27.340]  We're back, it is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show and I'm joined by the thought
[03:33:27.340 --> 03:33:32.860]  criminal of the day, here's Roosh V, it's Roosh V dot com first before we go to Roosh,
[03:33:32.860 --> 03:33:37.580]  I want to talk about this headline upon the Daily Beast, Amazon removes books by pro-rape
[03:33:37.580 --> 03:33:40.540]  leader Roosh report.
[03:33:40.540 --> 03:33:44.500]  Now again, this point cannot be made sternly enough.
[03:33:44.500 --> 03:33:49.900]  If you don't support unpopular free speech, if you don't support offensive free speech,
[03:33:49.900 --> 03:33:55.020]  you don't support free speech because everything is offensive to somebody.
[03:33:55.020 --> 03:33:59.820]  Roosh V tweeted a satirical joke about rape three years ago, yes we know, we know that
[03:33:59.820 --> 03:34:05.020]  James Gunn tweeted about molesting kids years ago, does he get the right to commerce, does
[03:34:05.020 --> 03:34:08.140]  he get the right to a bank account, yes he does.
[03:34:08.140 --> 03:34:13.940]  Sarah Jong can tweet about exterminating white people, does she get the right to commerce,
[03:34:13.940 --> 03:34:17.900]  does she get the right to a bank account, does she get the right to be verified by Twitter
[03:34:17.900 --> 03:34:21.220]  and given a job by the New York Times, yes she does.
[03:34:21.220 --> 03:34:26.380]  Peter Fonda, he can tweet about putting Baron Trump in a cage with pedophiles, again, I'm
[03:34:26.380 --> 03:34:28.220]  offended by that.
[03:34:28.220 --> 03:34:33.300]  Should my offense stop him from having a bank account and engaging in commerce, no it should
[03:34:33.300 --> 03:34:34.300]  not.
[03:34:34.300 --> 03:34:39.820]  This is a basic argument, free speech has to include offensive speech or it doesn't
[03:34:39.820 --> 03:34:46.140]  matter a damn job because everything is offensive to somebody, that is basic, that has been
[03:34:46.140 --> 03:34:50.580]  the understanding of free speech for decades and decades, that's the Supreme Court's understanding
[03:34:50.580 --> 03:34:55.180]  of free speech and the fact that now probably a majority of Americans don't even know that
[03:34:55.180 --> 03:34:57.860]  is absolutely chilling.
[03:34:57.860 --> 03:34:59.900]  Roosh V, welcome to the show.
[03:34:59.900 --> 03:35:06.060]  Apo, how are you, so what is your response to this Daily Beast headline, calling you
[03:35:06.060 --> 03:35:08.180]  a pro-rape leader.
[03:35:08.180 --> 03:35:14.900]  Yeah, it's as if I have rape cells hiding everywhere and I'm just going to tell them
[03:35:14.900 --> 03:35:19.700]  to activate and ray one, it's the most absurd thing because they have no more arguments
[03:35:19.700 --> 03:35:26.420]  so they just shame you with whatever label is most convenient for them to find.
[03:35:26.420 --> 03:35:29.380]  Absolutely incredible and it's like, you know, just because I'm interviewing someone
[03:35:29.380 --> 03:35:33.940]  doesn't mean I have to agree with everything they say, they always dig up these old controversies
[03:35:33.940 --> 03:35:38.380]  about offensive things that people have said, like I don't know about them, like oh my
[03:35:38.380 --> 03:35:43.300]  god, did you hear about it, yes, everyone knows about it, I support offensive free speech,
[03:35:43.300 --> 03:35:48.900]  I don't care, so let's move on to the actual issue which is this, you know, back in 2009
[03:35:48.900 --> 03:35:55.460]  Amazon digitally erased copies of Orwell's 1984 from customers Kindle devices, that was
[03:35:55.460 --> 03:35:59.780]  over a copyright issue, if I remember rightly, but you know, most people laughed at the irony
[03:35:59.780 --> 03:36:04.820]  of that at the time, a few people warned that it was a sign of things to come.
[03:36:04.820 --> 03:36:08.900]  Tell us what happened to you with Amazon over the course of the past few days.
[03:36:08.900 --> 03:36:16.020]  Yeah, sure, so I just was working on my newest book, my first book in one year, it's called
[03:36:16.020 --> 03:36:20.340]  Game, it's just a book that helps men how to meet women.
[03:36:20.340 --> 03:36:26.820]  As you see from the cover, it's a man and a woman sitting romantically under a tree,
[03:36:26.820 --> 03:36:32.760]  it's nothing especially graphic or sexually explicit, at least compared to what other
[03:36:32.760 --> 03:36:34.620]  titles Amazon has.
[03:36:34.620 --> 03:36:39.660]  And then I officially dropped it on Friday, but before then, a lot of people were finding
[03:36:39.660 --> 03:36:44.660]  the book and it was climbing the Amazon chart, so the day I dropped it, I told everyone to
[03:36:44.660 --> 03:36:48.420]  go and buy it, it was already ranked in the top seven or eight thousand.
[03:36:48.420 --> 03:36:56.500]  Well soon it jumped to number 698, and that's when the emails from Amazon started to come
[03:36:56.500 --> 03:37:01.900]  in, they first banned eight of my other books, then on Monday they banned this book too.
[03:37:01.900 --> 03:37:06.740]  And to me, it seems like the trigger was that it was doing well, I had some other books
[03:37:06.740 --> 03:37:12.220]  that were ranked 50,000, been on Amazon for five years, they didn't do anything.
[03:37:12.220 --> 03:37:20.340]  But the second this book cracked, the top 10,000, Amazon went on a rampage.
[03:37:20.340 --> 03:37:23.940]  Now as you just said, it was doing really well, do you think that was the reason why
[03:37:23.940 --> 03:37:24.940]  they took it down?
[03:37:24.940 --> 03:37:30.220]  And was it also connected to this kind of stampede of censorship over the past month
[03:37:30.220 --> 03:37:35.140]  where these brigades of hateful mobs have been rewarded and learned that they can organize,
[03:37:35.140 --> 03:37:39.580]  that they can put pressure on big companies to take people's content down?
[03:37:39.580 --> 03:37:41.980]  Do you think that was part of this too?
[03:37:41.980 --> 03:37:47.820]  I think what they start with is those people, the public figures who have the most influence
[03:37:47.820 --> 03:37:53.660]  to change what the narrative is, to change the globalist narrative, such as Alex Jones.
[03:37:53.660 --> 03:37:58.900]  If you're a small guy, they're probably not going to come after you first, so they're
[03:37:58.900 --> 03:38:00.060]  going to get Alex Jones.
[03:38:00.060 --> 03:38:04.460]  And then me, anyone who is making a difference who's red pilling a lot of people, that's
[03:38:04.460 --> 03:38:05.460]  what I think.
[03:38:05.460 --> 03:38:09.340]  I don't know because Amazon won't tell me, I've sent them a lot of emails, I've called
[03:38:09.340 --> 03:38:15.180]  them, they absolutely refuse to tell me which content guidelines I broke.
[03:38:15.180 --> 03:38:20.620]  It's like I got arrested for a crime, but the judge won't tell me which crime I committed,
[03:38:20.620 --> 03:38:24.540]  but I'm being sent to jail anyway.
[03:38:24.540 --> 03:38:28.500]  This is the essence of truly Catholicist societies.
[03:38:28.500 --> 03:38:33.340]  When they banned info wars, when they suspended me on Twitter for 12 hours, there was no email
[03:38:33.340 --> 03:38:34.340]  whatsoever.
[03:38:34.340 --> 03:38:38.340]  They sent a selection of tweets a few days later, some of which had literally nothing
[03:38:38.340 --> 03:38:42.060]  to do with Alex Jones and said that they were hateful, they were harassment.
[03:38:42.060 --> 03:38:46.460]  But in most cases, they don't even tell you what thing you've broken, so then it's completely
[03:38:46.460 --> 03:38:47.460]  arbitrary.
[03:38:47.460 --> 03:38:52.540]  In fact, in your article, which I also quoted from in the info wars article, which is up
[03:38:52.540 --> 03:38:58.660]  on Drudge, you talk about how Amazon defines, I think, offensive content and their definition
[03:38:58.660 --> 03:39:03.340]  of what is offensive is so vague, it's almost ridiculous, right?
[03:39:03.340 --> 03:39:11.260]  Yeah, I mean, they won't tell you, they say the official stance is that, quote, we, what
[03:39:11.260 --> 03:39:15.140]  is deemed offensive is what you think it is.
[03:39:15.140 --> 03:39:20.660]  That's their official policy, which gives them leeway to really whatever they want to
[03:39:20.660 --> 03:39:25.260]  say is offensive, then that's going to be the case.
[03:39:25.260 --> 03:39:31.100]  Because this book I have is way more tame than books like 50 Shades of Grey, Amazon sells
[03:39:31.100 --> 03:39:38.740]  a lot of books that feature rape, child rape, how to manipulate men, they sell books on
[03:39:38.740 --> 03:39:44.740]  incest, they sell books on how gay men can travel and get sex, they sell a lot of stuff.
[03:39:44.740 --> 03:39:46.860]  And I'm not saying that they shouldn't.
[03:39:46.860 --> 03:39:52.380]  But my book with this couple sitting under a tree trying to fall in love is probably one
[03:39:52.380 --> 03:39:58.420]  of the most tame dating books that is on Amazon or was on it.
[03:39:58.420 --> 03:40:05.500]  And they, I think they shut it down because, you know, it's more, more based on who I am
[03:40:05.500 --> 03:40:07.380]  and what I'm trying to do.
[03:40:07.380 --> 03:40:12.820]  If I was trying to help transgender women find love, then they would feature it on their
[03:40:12.820 --> 03:40:14.020]  homepage.
[03:40:14.020 --> 03:40:19.420]  But the second you try to help straight men find love, oh, that is a problem and Amazon
[03:40:19.420 --> 03:40:20.980]  singles you out.
[03:40:20.980 --> 03:40:23.740]  So I think it's, they're trying to find out who you are.
[03:40:23.740 --> 03:40:28.620]  If you don't agree with them, they're going to find some excuse in your content, your
[03:40:28.620 --> 03:40:33.940]  tweets and your videos, when like you pointed out, the left does far worse.
[03:40:33.940 --> 03:40:34.940]  Yeah.
[03:40:34.940 --> 03:40:39.620]  And going to that point, which you just mentioned regarding, you know, if you had advocating
[03:40:39.620 --> 03:40:43.460]  for transgender dating or things like that, you'd be celebrated and worship.
[03:40:43.460 --> 03:40:47.580]  You know, we just got the largest study of men's fertility ever, I believe the article
[03:40:47.580 --> 03:40:48.580]  came out today.
[03:40:48.580 --> 03:40:50.260]  It's up on infowords.com.
[03:40:50.260 --> 03:40:54.700]  And sperm counts have dropped nearly 60% since the early seventies.
[03:40:54.700 --> 03:40:59.660]  I think they're talking about seeing male patients for fertility problems four times
[03:40:59.660 --> 03:41:01.340]  as much as they did a few years ago.
[03:41:01.340 --> 03:41:02.340]  It's exploded.
[03:41:02.340 --> 03:41:03.980]  The problem seems to be getting worse.
[03:41:03.980 --> 03:41:06.940]  They go through a list of reasons why that might be.
[03:41:06.940 --> 03:41:11.980]  But again, this, that appears to have largely affected white Western men more than anyone
[03:41:11.980 --> 03:41:12.980]  else.
[03:41:12.980 --> 03:41:17.620]  You know, we're constantly browbeat and that toxic masculinity is this big threat that needs
[03:41:17.620 --> 03:41:22.180]  to be eliminated, the whole incel movement, they've whipped up a lot of hysteria over
[03:41:22.180 --> 03:41:23.180]  that.
[03:41:23.180 --> 03:41:29.020]  Now, do your books and message pose a threat to that cultural agenda to emasculate men?
[03:41:29.020 --> 03:41:34.220]  And could that be part of the reason, at least part of it, why Amazon has banned them?
[03:41:34.220 --> 03:41:40.060]  Because they see you as this kind of neo masculinity figure that is trying to get men back to a
[03:41:40.060 --> 03:41:45.380]  situation, you know, where they are confident, where they're not completely emasculated and
[03:41:45.380 --> 03:41:50.380]  where they can actually be fruitful members of society and have stable, decent relationships
[03:41:50.380 --> 03:41:55.940]  in the long term or at least be successful with women not having been completely demoralized
[03:41:55.940 --> 03:42:00.540]  by this anti-masculine agenda in the mainstream media and in the popular culture.
[03:42:00.540 --> 03:42:01.540]  Yeah.
[03:42:01.540 --> 03:42:07.380]  The one thing I teach men is not to take abuse from women who cancel on them, flake on them,
[03:42:07.380 --> 03:42:08.580]  don't treat them right.
[03:42:08.580 --> 03:42:14.780]  Don't automatically give your respect to a woman just because she exists.
[03:42:14.780 --> 03:42:16.260]  She has to earn it.
[03:42:16.260 --> 03:42:20.260]  And I teach men, you know, to treat women just as good as they treat you.
[03:42:20.260 --> 03:42:22.380]  But this idea is now toxic.
[03:42:22.380 --> 03:42:27.940]  A man pursuing his own self-interest is toxic while anyone else, if they pursue their own
[03:42:27.940 --> 03:42:31.380]  self-interest, is empowering and strong and brave.
[03:42:31.380 --> 03:42:37.180]  Just like how they put that large woman on the cover of Cosmopolitan, you have to worship
[03:42:37.180 --> 03:42:41.020]  her, but you can't help men.
[03:42:41.020 --> 03:42:42.020]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:42:42.020 --> 03:42:46.020]  The thought criminal does your Roosh Vee, and we'll be back on the other side of the
[03:42:46.020 --> 03:42:50.020]  breaker website, is RooshVee.com, where you can still get his fan book.
[03:42:50.020 --> 03:42:51.540]  This is the Alex Jones Show Live.
[03:42:51.540 --> 03:42:52.540]  We'll be right back.
[03:42:52.540 --> 03:42:53.540]  Don't go away.
[03:42:53.540 --> 03:42:57.340]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[03:42:57.340 --> 03:43:01.860]  The real drama can be found here in Lelani Estates, but a lot of us on the Big Island
[03:43:01.860 --> 03:43:07.300]  rely on rainwater, and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[03:43:07.300 --> 03:43:12.700]  Big ash may contain heavy metal particles, and acid rain could lower the pH of the water
[03:43:12.700 --> 03:43:14.220]  to unhealthy levels.
[03:43:14.220 --> 03:43:20.740]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[03:43:20.740 --> 03:43:24.740]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity
[03:43:24.740 --> 03:43:26.140]  in the rainwater.
[03:43:26.140 --> 03:43:31.460]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure Gravity Filter, and not only were the heavy
[03:43:31.460 --> 03:43:37.540]  metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[03:43:37.540 --> 03:43:43.180]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water, so what we've
[03:43:43.180 --> 03:43:48.500]  learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:43:48.500 --> 03:43:53.540]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:43:53.540 --> 03:43:58.420]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[03:43:58.420 --> 03:44:02.900]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients, and stress, you may not be able to get all

[03:45:18.540 --> 03:45:48.500]  censorship in which they want to strangle our first amendment rights.

[03:46:57.420 --> 03:47:22.060]  We
[03:47:22.060 --> 03:47:27.500]  basically have a situation whereby for months and months and months CNN Buzzfeed and others
[03:47:27.500 --> 03:47:30.660]  lobbied to have Alex Jones removed from social media.
[03:47:30.660 --> 03:47:35.060]  He was removed from basically all the major social media platforms apart from Twitter
[03:47:35.060 --> 03:47:39.860]  and then they said, oh, you're not being banned, you still have a platform on Twitter.
[03:47:39.860 --> 03:47:45.300]  You still have an app in the App Store, boom, banned by Twitter, banned by the App Store.
[03:47:45.300 --> 03:47:49.740]  Oh, but you still have a website, you still have Infowars Store, you still have a shop
[03:47:49.740 --> 03:47:50.740]  front.
[03:47:50.740 --> 03:47:52.380]  And then what do we see?
[03:47:52.380 --> 03:47:53.380]  Washington Post.
[03:47:53.380 --> 03:47:58.100]  Oh my God, traffic to Alex Jones' Infowars Store has increased by 50%.
[03:47:58.100 --> 03:48:02.340]  Maybe now we should look at that, that's an awful nice shop front you've got there.
[03:48:02.340 --> 03:48:06.500]  Maybe let's put some pressure on the payment processors all the way down the line.
[03:48:06.500 --> 03:48:09.900]  They literally want to sabotage people's right to commerce.
[03:48:09.900 --> 03:48:14.660]  Robert Spencer's right to basically have a MasterCard account linked to his Patreon.
[03:48:14.660 --> 03:48:18.740]  That was deemed hateful, that was cancelled, I think he got it back in the end.
[03:48:18.740 --> 03:48:24.180]  So this just shows you the absolute intensification of this, they will not stop, which is why
[03:48:24.180 --> 03:48:28.660]  we need your support right now by getting the products at InfowarsStore.com.

[03:48:59.300 --> 03:49:01.340]  these deplatforming campaigns.
[03:49:01.340 --> 03:49:06.980]  We're not funded by giant fat checks from Dulph State dictatorships like CNN is, so they can
[03:49:06.980 --> 03:49:09.500]  fund these deplatforming campaigns.
[03:49:09.500 --> 03:49:14.420]  We're only funded by you by getting the products at InfowarsStore.com, where we have a massive
[03:49:14.420 --> 03:49:17.820]  50% off right now on supermail vitality.
[03:49:17.820 --> 03:49:19.980]  Go there and get it today.
[03:49:19.980 --> 03:49:25.540]  Going back to our guest now, Roush V, who has been, his books have been banned by the digital
[03:49:25.540 --> 03:49:31.780]  Nazi book burners over at Amazon.com, I think it's nine out of 19 have been banned so far.
[03:49:31.780 --> 03:49:35.140]  Roush, I put up this tweet earlier today.
[03:49:35.140 --> 03:49:36.900]  The year is 2050.
[03:49:36.900 --> 03:49:41.820]  After transcending into the singularity and going full cyborg, Mark Zuckerberg's oxygen
[03:49:41.820 --> 03:49:45.900]  book has literally bought the atmosphere over the entire planet.
[03:49:45.900 --> 03:49:48.740]  Thought criminals have been banned from breathing.
[03:49:48.740 --> 03:49:53.940]  But establishment conservatives respond in unison, but they're a private company.
[03:49:53.940 --> 03:49:56.140]  At least it's not the government.
[03:49:56.140 --> 03:49:59.180]  What do you think about a tired line here over and over again?
[03:49:59.180 --> 03:50:06.380]  This more private company argument from conservatives every time this happens, every time it intensifies.
[03:50:06.380 --> 03:50:07.380]  It's okay, Paul.
[03:50:07.380 --> 03:50:10.020]  We're going to build our own atmosphere.
[03:50:10.020 --> 03:50:12.180]  We're going to build our own Amazon, our own internet.
[03:50:12.180 --> 03:50:16.900]  I'm laying fiber optic cables under the Atlantic Ocean right now.
[03:50:16.900 --> 03:50:23.780]  But what they're doing is, if a baker doesn't want to bake a cake, they get on him.
[03:50:23.780 --> 03:50:31.020]  He's homophobic, racist, even though there's 100 bakeries down the street from him.
[03:50:31.020 --> 03:50:35.780]  But now, if you don't say the right things, they kick you off of Facebook.
[03:50:35.780 --> 03:50:39.900]  They say, well, build your own social networking, but there's no other Facebook.
[03:50:39.900 --> 03:50:44.500]  These are tech monopolies that dominate their sector completely.
[03:50:44.500 --> 03:50:46.300]  Amazon dominates books.
[03:50:46.300 --> 03:50:51.260]  They sell over 40% of books in the USA.
[03:50:51.260 --> 03:50:53.020]  There's no alternative.
[03:50:53.020 --> 03:50:57.620]  These are monopolies, and I don't trust the government to get involved.
[03:50:57.620 --> 03:50:59.140]  I don't trust them.
[03:50:59.140 --> 03:51:01.580]  Usually what they touch, it goes bad.
[03:51:01.580 --> 03:51:05.580]  But if the government doesn't do something, these companies are going to keep on ruining
[03:51:05.580 --> 03:51:07.260]  people's livelihood.
[03:51:07.260 --> 03:51:11.060]  When they do, they're going to send you an email and not even explain it.
[03:51:11.060 --> 03:51:16.300]  So it's very convenient for the left to say it's a private business when we get banned.
[03:51:16.300 --> 03:51:21.020]  But one of their own, you don't bake a cake, then they lose their minds and they start
[03:51:21.020 --> 03:51:23.980]  suing you and put a bakery out of business.
[03:51:23.980 --> 03:51:29.460]  So they only use that argument when it protects themselves.
[03:51:29.460 --> 03:51:34.180]  Another example where they lost their minds, which ties into that, there was a Think Progress
[03:51:34.180 --> 03:51:39.300]  article, which is another far-left website, it's by far from being a credible centrist
[03:51:39.300 --> 03:51:41.300]  website or however they want to present it.
[03:51:41.300 --> 03:51:45.900]  There was a Think Progress article on Facebook, weekly standard.
[03:51:45.900 --> 03:51:51.060]  So Facebook's literally got like one fact-checker who isn't Snopes and the Associated Press.
[03:51:51.060 --> 03:51:56.260]  One fact-checker who's like this establishment conservative group, weekly standard.
[03:51:56.260 --> 03:51:59.940]  Fact-check to Think Progress article found it to be inaccurate.
[03:51:59.940 --> 03:52:05.380]  People absolutely lost their minds, the verified checkmarks on Twitter lost their minds.
[03:52:05.380 --> 03:52:11.500]  I often hear people say, watch out, the censorship that Progressives instigated will eventually
[03:52:11.500 --> 03:52:12.980]  boomerang back on them.
[03:52:12.980 --> 03:52:14.660]  I don't really see that.
[03:52:14.660 --> 03:52:17.460]  The example that you gave, they don't get their gay wedding cake.
[03:52:17.460 --> 03:52:20.860]  They can literally go to the baker down the road and get their gay wedding cake.
[03:52:20.860 --> 03:52:22.940]  It's not the same scenario.
[03:52:22.940 --> 03:52:25.780]  We have the James Gunn firing, things like that.
[03:52:25.780 --> 03:52:30.020]  I didn't support that in spirit, but that's basically the only example in recent times.
[03:52:30.020 --> 03:52:33.180]  But again, he's not stopped from engaging in commerce.
[03:52:33.180 --> 03:52:34.580]  They own Silicon Valley.
[03:52:34.580 --> 03:52:38.820]  I don't see a deluge of left wingers being banned anytime soon.
[03:52:38.820 --> 03:52:44.060]  I don't see this boomeranging back on them anytime soon, do you?
[03:52:44.060 --> 03:52:48.580]  I think it's going to start with those who are to the left of the Democratic Party, those
[03:52:48.580 --> 03:52:51.580]  who support Bernie Sanders.
[03:52:51.580 --> 03:52:55.660]  They had their primary election and the last election rigged.
[03:52:55.660 --> 03:53:01.620]  So I think unless your opinion perfectly fits with those who control Amazon, Facebook, any
[03:53:01.620 --> 03:53:07.700]  global 500 companies, oil companies, all these companies, unless your opinion matches them,
[03:53:07.700 --> 03:53:09.580]  you could be on the chopping block.
[03:53:09.580 --> 03:53:12.980]  They're going to start with those who have the most influence first and work their way
[03:53:12.980 --> 03:53:13.980]  down.
[03:53:13.980 --> 03:53:18.060]  But one thing is that even in the private sector, you don't know how many emails I get
[03:53:18.060 --> 03:53:23.420]  from men who are scared to speak their mind at work, who are scared just to have a chat
[03:53:23.420 --> 03:53:25.740]  with the female at work.
[03:53:25.740 --> 03:53:30.660]  Many men have been fired and these are the quiet victims because when I get banned, everyone
[03:53:30.660 --> 03:53:32.020]  is going to know about it.
[03:53:32.020 --> 03:53:37.540]  But an average Joe who has a middle-class job when they fire him because he made a spicy
[03:53:37.540 --> 03:53:42.300]  joke at work, he doesn't have anywhere to really go.
[03:53:42.300 --> 03:53:44.420]  So it's happening to us.
[03:53:44.420 --> 03:53:46.100]  Is it going to happen to the left?
[03:53:46.100 --> 03:53:50.900]  I think once they run out of victims on the right, once they run out of guys like Alex
[03:53:50.900 --> 03:53:56.980]  Jones and me and everyone else, where else is this gun that they're firing going to
[03:53:56.980 --> 03:53:57.980]  go on?
[03:53:57.980 --> 03:54:00.340]  Because they want complete compliance.
[03:54:00.340 --> 03:54:01.740]  You have to agree with them.
[03:54:01.740 --> 03:54:04.620]  You cannot have a deviation of thought.
[03:54:04.620 --> 03:54:08.540]  So right now, the biggest deviants are people like us.
[03:54:08.540 --> 03:54:14.620]  But those on the left, they're starting to overthrow some of these longtime democratic
[03:54:14.620 --> 03:54:16.340]  incumbents in Congress.
[03:54:16.340 --> 03:54:19.260]  They are going to be next.
[03:54:19.260 --> 03:54:23.060]  Me today, you tomorrow.
[03:54:23.060 --> 03:54:24.060]  I mean, it's incredible.
[03:54:24.060 --> 03:54:28.020]  You talk there about people in the workplace and how they basically can barely even talk
[03:54:28.020 --> 03:54:32.220]  to women at this point without being at least under threat, thinking they would get some
[03:54:32.220 --> 03:54:33.220]  backlash from that.
[03:54:33.220 --> 03:54:38.540]  There was a study a few months ago, I did a video on this, 25% of US millennials think
[03:54:38.540 --> 03:54:42.380]  that asking a woman for a drink is a form of sexual harassment.
[03:54:42.380 --> 03:54:45.500]  That was literally what came out of one of the polls.
[03:54:45.500 --> 03:54:50.340]  So this book is the most sexual harassing book ever, you know, and that's why it can't
[03:54:50.340 --> 03:54:51.340]  be tolerated.
[03:54:51.340 --> 03:54:55.580]  I mean, because basically you're giving young men a message of just self-confidence and for
[03:54:55.580 --> 03:54:58.540]  some reason that is a massive threat to the current system.
[03:54:58.540 --> 03:55:03.580]  How can giving young men self-confidence be that much of a threat?
[03:55:03.580 --> 03:55:07.940]  You can empower men because they see it as zero sum gain.
[03:55:07.940 --> 03:55:13.700]  If men are getting what they want out of life, then there must be some toxic masculinity
[03:55:13.700 --> 03:55:18.580]  conspiracy theory that's holding women down, preventing them from education and preventing
[03:55:18.580 --> 03:55:20.420]  them from jobs.
[03:55:20.420 --> 03:55:25.300]  You know, they all see that only women have to be helped at the same time men are pushed
[03:55:25.300 --> 03:55:26.300]  down.
[03:55:26.300 --> 03:55:32.340]  That's the only way we can create our gender utopia and right the wrongs of 10,000 years
[03:55:32.340 --> 03:55:36.140]  ago when we lived in tribes and patriarchal societies.
[03:55:36.140 --> 03:55:42.820]  I mean, it's a real sick mindset that you today have to suffer because 500 years ago,
[03:55:42.820 --> 03:55:46.020]  young men somewhere didn't allow women to vote.
[03:55:46.020 --> 03:55:51.140]  But I can tell you, Paul, there is nothing a woman can do, can't do today that I can
[03:55:51.140 --> 03:55:52.140]  do.
[03:55:52.140 --> 03:55:53.140]  Women can do anything they want.
[03:55:53.140 --> 03:55:54.140]  They can work hard.
[03:55:54.140 --> 03:55:55.140]  They can go to school.
[03:55:55.140 --> 03:55:57.180]  They can buy any products that they want.
[03:55:57.180 --> 03:55:59.280]  They can say whatever they want.
[03:55:59.280 --> 03:56:02.040]  But now men can't, especially if you're a straight man.
[03:56:02.040 --> 03:56:06.980]  That's why a lot of men I know now they say at work they pretend to be gay.
[03:56:06.980 --> 03:56:12.940]  They said that gives them a shield to not get attacked, to, you know, play the gay,
[03:56:12.940 --> 03:56:14.860]  to play the gay card.
[03:56:14.860 --> 03:56:16.380]  And that's how bad it is.
[03:56:16.380 --> 03:56:17.380]  Incredible.
[03:56:17.380 --> 03:56:18.780]  Got about a minute left.
[03:56:18.780 --> 03:56:22.740]  Just tell people where they can still get this banned book for the time being where
[03:56:22.740 --> 03:56:24.100]  they can go to get it.
[03:56:24.100 --> 03:56:25.100]  Yeah.
[03:56:25.100 --> 03:56:30.140]  So right now the paperback copy on Amazon is gone, but you can still order the e-book
[03:56:30.140 --> 03:56:38.060]  and the audio book directly from my web store and you can find the links at rushv.com.
[03:56:38.060 --> 03:56:43.540]  And you know, thankfully most people read books now on e-books instead of paperback.
[03:56:43.540 --> 03:56:48.260]  So I hope this is just a speed bump, you know, and I hope what's happening to Alex Jones
[03:56:48.260 --> 03:56:52.300]  also is a speed bump, but they're going after him extremely hard.
[03:56:52.300 --> 03:56:55.300]  And I hope he is strong enough to overcome this.
[03:56:55.300 --> 03:57:00.820]  But yeah, if people do want to read about what Amazon, the basic dating advice that
[03:57:00.820 --> 03:57:05.300]  Amazon wants to ban, they can go to my website, rushv.com.
[03:57:05.300 --> 03:57:06.300]  Okay.
