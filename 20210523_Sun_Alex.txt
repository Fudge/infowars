[00:00.000 --> 00:10.400]  Facing long tours overseas, injury or death, new recruits entering one of the branches
[00:10.400 --> 00:16.000]  of the U.S. military could always maintain morale by knowing that they were protecting
[00:16.000 --> 00:19.360]  cherished freedoms, namely the First Amendment.
[00:19.360 --> 00:24.720]  Many of the protesters expressing the portion of the First Amendment on January 6th portions
[00:24.720 --> 00:30.720]  the country club in Washington, D.C. wasn't prepared to represent to the angered masses
[00:30.720 --> 00:34.200]  included a Air Force vet who was killed in cold blood.
[00:34.200 --> 00:38.960]  They had assembled and petitioned the government for a redress of grievances over a presidential
[00:38.960 --> 00:43.160]  election that even today still shows instances of fraud.
[00:43.160 --> 00:48.560]  I don't know why an audit should be such a subjective concern, but it seems to be absolutely
[00:48.560 --> 00:51.200]  terrifying lefty groups all across the country.
[00:51.200 --> 00:56.640]  Need to be targeted by a commission to further politicize the expanding tyranny on the hill.
[00:56.640 --> 01:00.280]  Greatest threat to the American experiment since the Civil War.
[01:00.280 --> 01:06.120]  What took place on January 6th in the United States Capitol building was an act of domestic
[01:06.120 --> 01:07.120]  terrorism.
[01:07.120 --> 01:15.080]  Why is one form of political violence equivalent to 9-11 when a blind eye has been turned by
[01:15.080 --> 01:20.040]  this Congress or at least by the majority in this Congress to that same phenomenon across
[01:20.040 --> 01:22.280]  this country for a year?
[01:22.280 --> 01:29.200]  Meanwhile, Biden's new racial justice military act more than this is more than 40% of our
[01:29.200 --> 01:32.040]  active duty forces are people of color.
[01:32.040 --> 01:37.960]  It's long past time that the department's leadership reflects that diversity.
[01:37.960 --> 01:44.400]  Led by former Raytheon board member Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is dead set on further
[01:44.400 --> 01:47.280]  eroding what makes the military tick.
[01:47.280 --> 01:51.880]  The job of the Department of Defense is to keep America safe from our enemies, but we
[01:51.880 --> 01:56.760]  can't do that if some of those enemies lie within our own ranks and to rid our ranks
[01:56.760 --> 01:58.800]  of racist and extremist.
[01:58.800 --> 02:06.400]  We need civilian control in the form of a genuinely civilian Defense Secretary for the
[02:06.400 --> 02:13.720]  Defense Secretary in a sense to serve as our agent to try to ensure that the military's
[02:13.720 --> 02:21.520]  understanding of liberty and security aligns with our understanding of liberty and security.
[02:21.520 --> 02:29.360]  I have serious doubts that he has that appreciation for what liberty and security mean in the
[02:29.360 --> 02:30.440]  larger sense.
[02:30.440 --> 02:35.600]  I am very confident that the number of extremists in my forces is zero.
[02:35.600 --> 02:39.120]  I would tell you right now that we have done everything that Secretary Austin has asked
[02:39.120 --> 02:43.680]  us to do in terms of training and awareness, but in my organization I would say that number
[02:43.680 --> 02:44.680]  is zero.
[02:44.680 --> 02:50.840]  The Extremism Steering Committee overseen by Lloyd Austin's senior advisor Bishop Garrison
[02:50.840 --> 02:57.360]  is designing a social media program that will continuously monitor soldiers for concerning
[02:57.360 --> 02:58.360]  behavior.
[02:58.360 --> 03:04.440]  A believer that our founding was in 1619 will now be vetting our armed services, a few of
[03:04.440 --> 03:08.200]  which go back to 1776.
[03:08.200 --> 03:13.240]  And since we're in the mood for vetting the military, let's check a few of Bishop Garrison's
[03:13.240 --> 03:14.880]  past tweets.
[03:14.880 --> 03:20.040]  Support for him, meaning Trump, a racist, is support for all his beliefs.
[03:20.040 --> 03:23.880]  If you support the president, you support extremists and racists.
[03:23.880 --> 03:27.640]  You support all of his beliefs as we define them.
[03:27.640 --> 03:29.640]  Crystal clear.
[03:29.640 --> 03:34.960]  You would think that this would violate the military's First Amendment protections, however,
[03:34.960 --> 03:40.660]  taking a page from the immunity-afforded Silicon Valley with Section 230, the military
[03:40.660 --> 03:47.160]  brass has found a loophole in order to circumvent those God-given rights, hiring a private
[03:47.160 --> 03:52.560]  surveillance firm to monitor soldiers who are risking their lives to combat the very
[03:52.560 --> 03:56.240]  totalitarianism they will now have to obey.
[03:56.240 --> 04:02.200]  Meanwhile, a clandestine army poisoning society makes the CIA look like a dusty old joke.
[04:02.200 --> 04:07.320]  As Newsweek uncharacteristically revealed, the largest undercover force the world has
[04:07.320 --> 04:12.000]  ever known is the one created by the Pentagon over the past decade.
[04:12.000 --> 04:18.160]  Some 60,000 people now belong to this secret army, many working under massed identities
[04:18.160 --> 04:23.360]  and in low profile, all part of a broad program called Signature Reduction.
[04:23.360 --> 04:28.480]  The force, more than 10 times the size of the clandestine elements of the CIA, carries
[04:28.480 --> 04:34.120]  out domestic and foreign assignments, both in military uniforms and under civilian cover
[04:34.120 --> 04:36.480]  in real life and online.
[04:36.480 --> 04:42.400]  As hiding in private businesses and consultancies, some of them household-named companies.
[04:42.400 --> 05:03.720]  As privacy becomes a thing of the past, John Bown reporting.
[05:03.720 --> 05:09.840]  Your voice counts when you share information, be it over the Internet or in person, it changes
[05:09.840 --> 05:10.840]  the world.
[05:10.840 --> 05:13.280]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[05:13.280 --> 05:14.800]  They know you're angry.
[05:14.800 --> 05:19.120]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool
[05:19.120 --> 05:20.120]  we've got.

[06:16.720 --> 06:18.440]  You want to stop tyranny?
[06:18.440 --> 06:23.440]  Well, so does he, live from the InfoWars.com studios.
[06:23.440 --> 06:30.440]  This is Alex Jones.
[06:30.440 --> 06:34.200]  InfoWars, tomorrow's news, today.
[06:34.200 --> 06:40.960]  You are about to see footage from 12 years ago that aired on national television to record
[06:40.960 --> 06:46.800]  ratings for the channel that was then taken offline and completely censored.
[06:46.800 --> 06:53.400]  The network even went into people's DVRs and had it erased off of their own personal servers.
[06:53.400 --> 06:59.760]  Congress talked about holding hearings concerning the very episode you're about to see.
[06:59.760 --> 07:06.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, the reason the establishment got so scared was that Dr. Rima Lebo is a
[07:06.320 --> 07:11.600]  top medical doctor, and she was also the wife of General Stubblebine, the former head of
[07:11.600 --> 07:18.760]  U.S. Special Forces in the Army, who treated heads of states of major governments and royalty
[07:18.760 --> 07:20.720]  in Europe.
[07:20.720 --> 07:27.320]  They told her, as their medical doctor, the plan to depopulate in the Great Collin, with
[07:27.320 --> 07:33.680]  the WTO, the UN, doing it through the vaccines, how they would claim there wasn't enough vaccines,
[07:33.680 --> 07:38.720]  so they would then add dangerous chemicals to them to make them more powerful, which
[07:38.720 --> 07:41.360]  is what they've all done now.
[07:41.360 --> 07:45.080]  So here is the censored report.
[07:45.080 --> 07:49.160]  We're going to post the full show at band.video.
[07:49.160 --> 07:57.200]  But here is four minutes and 15 seconds of myself and Dr. Lebo laying it all out 12 years
[07:57.200 --> 07:58.200]  ago.
[07:58.200 --> 07:59.200]  How could we do that?
[07:59.200 --> 08:03.440]  We didn't just make this up, and it magically all happened the way we said.
[08:03.440 --> 08:04.440]  No.
[08:04.440 --> 08:09.720]  She had the sources, and I had also done major research on government documents like State
[08:09.720 --> 08:14.960]  Department memorandum 200 from Henry Kissinger that also laid out plans for depopulation.
[08:14.960 --> 08:20.120]  So here is the video that has the globalists so scared, because it exposed the great reset
[08:20.120 --> 08:22.560]  11 plus years before they launched it.
[08:22.560 --> 08:28.600]  There's an entire agenda afoot to force the population to undergo different type of medical
[08:28.600 --> 08:31.320]  treatments, namely vaccines.
[08:31.320 --> 08:35.920]  We're seeing a medical tyranny being set up, not just in the United States, but worldwide
[08:35.920 --> 08:39.000]  under the UN and the World Health Organization.
[08:39.000 --> 08:40.480]  Who's behind all this?
[08:40.480 --> 08:41.560]  The Bilderberg Group.
[08:41.560 --> 08:46.520]  They want a planetary dictatorship so they can carry out their forced depopulation agenda,
[08:46.520 --> 08:48.600]  and they want to do it through the medical system.
[08:48.600 --> 08:51.160]  And that's why vaccines are so important.
[08:51.160 --> 08:55.480]  We know that many of these vaccines turn out to have serious adverse reactions, that this
[08:55.480 --> 08:57.180]  is being done by design.
[08:57.180 --> 08:59.640]  They kill you slowly over time.
[08:59.640 --> 09:01.400]  That's why they're called soft kill.
[09:01.400 --> 09:05.960]  And I've got an insider I think you should really talk to, Dr. Rima Lebo, but she doesn't
[09:05.960 --> 09:10.200]  live inside the United States because she's so concerned about all the police state developments
[09:10.200 --> 09:11.640]  that are taking place.
[09:11.640 --> 09:15.720]  As soon as you and I finish, I'm leaving the country again.
[09:15.720 --> 09:16.720]  Why?
[09:16.720 --> 09:23.040]  Because in a very short time, not today, not tomorrow, but very soon, we'll be facing
[09:23.040 --> 09:29.280]  compulsory vaccination under the mistaken term of voluntary vaccination.
[09:29.280 --> 09:34.640]  Well, first of all, let's start with the fact that the World Health Organization has
[09:34.640 --> 09:39.600]  decided that we have 90% too many people.
[09:39.600 --> 09:47.400]  The World Health Organization has been working since 1974 on vaccines to create permanent
[09:47.400 --> 09:48.400]  sterility.
[09:48.400 --> 09:50.680]  This process has already been ongoing.
[09:50.680 --> 10:00.560]  To make matters worse, we know that the vaccines that were illegally approved by the FDA contain
[10:00.560 --> 10:03.480]  a substance called squalene.
[10:03.480 --> 10:09.120]  Squalene, an organic compound used in vaccines to stimulate the immune system and increase
[10:09.120 --> 10:11.080]  the response.
[10:11.080 --> 10:16.960]  If I inject you with squalene, your immune system will attack the squalene, but then
[10:16.960 --> 10:20.640]  it starts attacking all of the parts of your body.
[10:20.640 --> 10:23.880]  What does that look like when you meet a person to whom that is happening?
[10:23.880 --> 10:25.960]  It looks like Gulf War Syndrome.
[10:25.960 --> 10:32.920]  It looks like every joint in the body swollen and intolerably painful and immobilized.
[10:32.920 --> 10:35.320]  This is in these shocks they're going to give us?
[10:35.320 --> 10:39.920]  It's in some of them, but the U.S. government has to prick up their sleeve.
[10:39.920 --> 10:49.440]  They will induce a pandemic using the nasal mist vaccine, which is a live attenuated virus.
[10:49.440 --> 10:53.400]  That means that if I take it, I can infect you.
[10:53.400 --> 10:58.400]  You're going to get the flu, everybody around us is going to get the flu.
[10:58.400 --> 11:03.600]  Then the United States government, based on their statements that they've already made,
[11:03.600 --> 11:06.840]  will say, oh my, we have a pandemic.
[11:06.840 --> 11:10.360]  Oh my goodness, we don't have enough doses.
[11:10.360 --> 11:18.640]  So we'll add mix, squalene, at the 90,000 injection stations that the Department of
[11:18.640 --> 11:25.200]  Health and Human Services announced that they will ship the vaccines to.
[11:25.200 --> 11:30.520]  People lining up, sometimes by the hundreds, for an H1N1 flu shot.
[11:30.520 --> 11:40.800]  What that means is a holocaust, a genocidal holocaust.
[11:40.800 --> 11:46.440]  Men and women will thicken and die, and those who survive will be infertile.
[11:46.440 --> 11:48.240]  Let me tell you a story.
[11:48.240 --> 11:56.920]  In 2003, I had a patient in my drug-free medical practice who was ahead of state.
[11:56.920 --> 12:03.240]  And one day, she said, you know, it's almost time for the great culling to begin.
[12:03.240 --> 12:04.240]  The what?
[12:04.240 --> 12:05.600]  That's what I said.
[12:05.600 --> 12:06.600]  The what?
[12:06.600 --> 12:11.080]  She said, the great culling, C-U-L-L-I-N-G.
[12:11.080 --> 12:14.680]  When you thin the herd, I said, what are you talking about?
[12:14.680 --> 12:21.160]  She said, it's almost time for the useless eaters to be cold.
[12:21.160 --> 12:29.400]  And she said, those are the people who are consuming our non-renewable natural resources.
[12:29.400 --> 12:32.720]  I said, who are the people who make this decision?
[12:32.720 --> 12:40.320]  She said, we, the aristocrats.
[12:40.320 --> 12:47.560]  That report is at band.videos sensor 2009 report featured MD whistleblower leaking plans for
[12:47.560 --> 12:52.080]  state viral release, triggering U.N. takeover slash depopulation.
[12:52.080 --> 12:56.160]  It's got 400, or 2000 views, these about 100 million views.
[12:56.160 --> 13:02.800]  We're going to save this planet, expose this operation, but that is something from the
[13:02.800 --> 13:08.080]  memory hole where I was on Jesse Ventura's television program.
[13:08.080 --> 13:12.560]  And that was one of two episodes out of three seasons that they deleted and did not re-air.
[13:12.560 --> 13:16.440]  Of course, those two episodes were the highest rated episodes.
[13:16.440 --> 13:22.600]  The police state had even more of the depopulation episode.
[13:22.600 --> 13:26.920]  And they even talked about congressional hearings about it and how we needed censorship because
[13:26.920 --> 13:29.120]  of what I and Dr. Labo had said.
[13:29.120 --> 13:35.240]  Of course, everything she just talked about, you've heard Dr. Francis Boyle on about, he
[13:35.240 --> 13:40.000]  got Congress to stop forcibly injecting the troops with experimental anthrax shot that
[13:40.000 --> 13:42.880]  had squalene in it that was causing Gold Force syndrome.
[13:42.880 --> 13:44.760]  That's mainstream news.
[13:44.760 --> 13:47.760]  About 30 years ago, it was a conspiracy theory.
[13:47.760 --> 13:51.680]  30 years ago, it was a conspiracy theory.
[13:51.680 --> 13:57.720]  Just like a year ago, they had Time Magazine, Newsweek articles, Snopes articles, Newsguard
[13:57.720 --> 14:03.520]  articles, the company that Bill Gates owns, saying that I'm debunked and my guests are
[14:03.520 --> 14:09.240]  debunked and that there was never any connection to the Wuhan lab, Origen, or the viruses manufactured
[14:09.240 --> 14:14.280]  even though top scientist 16 months ago scanned it and said it's five different viruses.
[14:14.280 --> 14:18.160]  Well now they're having to admit it's man-made and Fauci now says, looks like it may have
[14:18.160 --> 14:19.960]  come from a lab in China.
[14:19.960 --> 14:26.960]  Oh, but who ran the program to weaponize COVID virus, coronavirus?
[14:26.960 --> 14:33.080]  It was Fauci and that's come out in Congress last week and the week before.
[14:33.080 --> 14:38.040]  But everybody's having a field day with USA Today fact checkers and Snopes fact checkers
[14:38.040 --> 14:43.080]  saying, Jones is full of it a year ago and Senator Rand Paul's full of it.
[14:43.080 --> 14:47.000]  Now there's no connection to Wuhan.
[14:47.000 --> 14:48.000]  Why?
[14:48.000 --> 14:49.000]  Because why?
[14:49.000 --> 14:53.040]  We sent a fact checking team to Wuhan that spent three hours there and it was run by the
[14:53.040 --> 14:55.920]  people that ran the Wuhan operation.
[14:55.920 --> 14:59.440]  They even wrote the Lancet report saying no connection and we even have the emails where
[14:59.440 --> 15:05.880]  they say to cover up the fact that we wrote this.
[15:05.880 --> 15:06.880]  It's really incredible.
[15:06.880 --> 15:12.400]  So you don't know something's real until mainstream media has debunked it.
[15:12.400 --> 15:17.840]  As soon as you see that, you know you should look more into it.
[15:17.840 --> 15:18.840]  So there's so much to get into.
[15:18.840 --> 15:24.440]  You know it's Dr. Lebo, a medical doctor who treated royalty and heads of state.
[15:24.440 --> 15:30.320]  You notice that she said an oil in the vaccine, squaly at the time.
[15:30.320 --> 15:33.440]  Now it's SM-102 and others.
[15:33.440 --> 15:36.000]  You can read the data and say she don't SM-102.
[15:36.000 --> 15:39.320]  Now the debunkers tell you it's good for you, just like Monsanto used to say, oh you
[15:39.320 --> 15:43.040]  need to drink Roundup, but if you do you die, but they say you can drink it.
[15:43.040 --> 15:45.120]  But you don't want to drink it or you'll die.
[15:45.120 --> 15:46.520]  You'll definitely have your kidneys failed.
[15:46.520 --> 15:48.160]  You'll be on dialysis right to your life.
[15:48.160 --> 15:54.720]  But Monsanto said it's safe and hey they say SM-102 is good for you as well.
[15:54.720 --> 15:55.720]  We'll be right back.
[15:55.720 --> 15:56.720]  I'm Alex Jones.
[15:56.720 --> 15:57.720]  Stay with us.
[15:57.720 --> 16:03.800]  I'm not going to say this five times in a row to be obnoxious.
[16:03.800 --> 16:07.280]  I'm saying it because it's the key to victory over these criminals.
[16:07.280 --> 16:14.720]  Last week the arch-globalist Fauci admitted that roughly half of the CDC's top brass
[16:14.720 --> 16:19.720]  and workers, medical doctors, scientists, nurses, you name it, have taken the so-called
[16:19.720 --> 16:20.720]  COVID-19 frankenshot.
[16:20.720 --> 16:23.480]  I'm going to say it the second time.
[16:23.480 --> 16:31.280]  Around half of the doctors at the CDC at NIH refuse to take the frankenshots.
[16:31.280 --> 16:32.840]  They don't trust it.
[16:32.840 --> 16:34.160]  You shouldn't trust it.
[16:34.160 --> 16:36.960]  The vaccines have been banned in most countries around the world.
[16:36.960 --> 16:40.160]  This is an attack on the American people and the people of the world.
[16:40.160 --> 16:43.560]  This is an absolute red flag smoking gun.
[16:43.560 --> 16:46.400]  Again, let me say it two more times.
[16:46.400 --> 16:50.800]  Around half of the individuals that work at the NIH and CDC, the medical staff refuse
[16:50.800 --> 16:51.800]  to take the vaccines.
[16:51.800 --> 16:52.800]  That's right.
[16:52.800 --> 16:57.440]  The doctors, nurses, scientists do not trust a so-called vaccine and you should either
[16:57.440 --> 17:14.800]  use one or everyone you know about the truth.
[17:14.800 --> 17:28.920]  Infowars has been banned, arrested, attacked and threatened because we are effective.
[17:28.920 --> 17:30.880]  The great awakening is here.
[17:30.880 --> 17:37.600]  Go to banned.video, download the videos and share.
[17:37.600 --> 17:44.640]  Support the information war at infowarstore.com.
[17:44.640 --> 17:54.640]  And never give up the fight.
[17:54.640 --> 18:01.480]  Listen up, patriots.
[18:01.480 --> 18:05.760]  I'm running a sale that's the biggest I've ever run on three products that are already
[18:05.760 --> 18:06.760]  selling out.
[18:06.760 --> 18:11.200]  Well, then why am I selling it then at 50% off or 60% off depending on which sale you
[18:11.200 --> 18:12.200]  go with?
[18:12.200 --> 18:15.040]  Because I know a lot of you are on the fence, you haven't tried it, and I know you're going
[18:15.040 --> 18:16.400]  to get hooked once you do.
[18:16.400 --> 18:23.000]  So for one week only, we're running 50% off on ultimate fish oil, 50% off on winter
[18:23.000 --> 18:27.720]  sun with D3 and K-3 immune system, and oh my gosh, people love this so much, it's sold
[18:27.720 --> 18:33.520]  out for months back in limited supply, turbo force 10 hour, clean energy, it's 40% off.
[18:33.520 --> 18:39.440]  But you can get them all three together in the optimum trifecta back for 60% off.
[18:39.440 --> 18:43.120]  You've never offered that on these products, it's basically a lost leader.
[18:43.120 --> 18:45.880]  I want you to get them, I want you to try them, I want you to love them.
[18:45.880 --> 18:50.680]  So believe me, you're going to be a blown away, go to infowarstore.com, we're running
[18:50.680 --> 18:54.040]  this Monday through Sunday and the deal is over.
[18:54.040 --> 19:00.440]  Best deal ever, take advantage of it at infowarstore.com and fund the info war.
[19:00.440 --> 19:04.000]  14 months ago, I began to sell the broadcast every day.
[19:04.000 --> 19:07.160]  When the first world collapses, the third world dies.
[19:07.160 --> 19:11.320]  You have such a complex civilization with so many billions of moving parts that when
[19:11.320 --> 19:16.600]  you shut down the first world, it causes a chain reaction that will devastate the third
[19:16.600 --> 19:19.040]  world and really hurt the first world.
[19:19.040 --> 19:22.920]  Well now you're hearing about gas shortages all over the United States, that's because
[19:22.920 --> 19:26.880]  the companies and the systems and the drivers that could barely get the job done before
[19:26.880 --> 19:31.200]  delivering gas had been shut down, plus the Keystone Pipeline's been shut down, a lot
[19:31.200 --> 19:32.360]  of other pipelines.
[19:32.360 --> 19:35.880]  The left is now blowing up dams across the US.
[19:35.880 --> 19:39.120]  We're being shut down, our coal power plants are off as well.
[19:39.120 --> 19:42.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, prepare to be a total slave.
[19:42.000 --> 19:44.760]  The third world is imploding as well, the borders have been removed.
[19:44.760 --> 19:49.560]  Until you wake up, this is a globalist chai-com takeover, Gregory said, you have no hope.
[19:49.560 --> 19:54.600]  They're announcing that there will be less than two-thirds of the gas needed this summer,
[19:54.600 --> 19:58.080]  so they told you that you're under lockdown one way or another and CNN laughed at you
[19:58.080 --> 20:03.480]  and your family.
[20:03.480 --> 20:24.640]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:24.640 --> 20:34.040]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[20:34.040 --> 20:39.680]  I have thought quite a bit about today's broadcast and I've thought quite a bit about next week's
[20:39.680 --> 20:46.000]  transmissions coming up, the weekday shows from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. and the most important
[20:46.000 --> 20:54.080]  thing, a realization I've come to is either tomorrow or Tuesday, by Tuesday I should be
[20:54.080 --> 20:55.080]  able to do it.
[20:55.080 --> 21:02.600]  I've got to go back to the last few months of COVID news because everything they've
[21:02.600 --> 21:10.880]  said has been a pure lie, the WTO, the UN, Bill Gates Fauci, the Lulon Lab and the revelations
[21:10.880 --> 21:17.280]  that have come out daily have been so big that I was up here yesterday for a few hours
[21:17.280 --> 21:27.520]  on Saturday and I just reviewed a couple stacks from not the week I was gone on a work occasion
[21:27.520 --> 21:34.800]  to Florida, but the week before, I went through a few stacks from a week and a half ago and
[21:34.800 --> 21:44.680]  I got really freaked out because there were at least 20 huge stories that each one could
[21:44.680 --> 21:49.960]  bring down Fauci and Gates and the Lulon Lab and the big pharma owners and put them in
[21:49.960 --> 21:55.560]  prison for the rest of their lives.
[21:55.560 --> 22:00.520]  And then I got home last night and spent hours researching and there was so much breaking
[22:00.520 --> 22:04.760]  last night that I was like, how do you cover all this and the answer is shut up and cover
[22:04.760 --> 22:05.760]  it.
[22:05.760 --> 22:06.760]  I do.
[22:06.760 --> 22:11.760]  In all the other shows we produce and the special reports we put out, but you really
[22:11.760 --> 22:16.400]  have to get the fact that it's massive.
[22:16.400 --> 22:19.080]  I mean, here's one example.
[22:19.080 --> 22:29.240]  The director of the Lulon operations for Fauci and Gates is on video in 2019 admitting that
[22:29.240 --> 22:38.400]  they've put five viruses together from bats to produce a super vaccine.
[22:38.400 --> 22:42.720]  And then right as he's saying that, it's being released all evidence shows out of the Lulon
[22:42.720 --> 22:43.720]  Lab.
[22:43.720 --> 22:48.760]  And I remember Tucker Carlson covered that two weeks ago.
[22:48.760 --> 22:52.040]  So I only got into two stacks because they stack up going back several months, every
[22:52.040 --> 22:56.240]  day shows, and then they shred it and it gets hauled off by the shredder company, but they
[22:56.240 --> 22:59.040]  put it in the shredder machine and truck comes and gets it.
[22:59.040 --> 23:02.360]  Not sure why they shred all the articles, but just every piece of paper that leaves
[23:02.360 --> 23:03.360]  there, they shred it.
[23:03.360 --> 23:05.640]  So I guess those are the shredder, too.
[23:05.640 --> 23:09.840]  And imagine if I just went through, because each day stacks probably about 10 inches tall,
[23:09.840 --> 23:13.600]  6 or 10 inches tall.
[23:13.600 --> 23:17.200]  And imagine if we just went through a month of it.
[23:17.200 --> 23:21.360]  My God, can you imagine a year of it?
[23:21.360 --> 23:23.000]  I mean, look what's out today.
[23:23.000 --> 23:28.040]  Fauci went on the Sunday morning shows today and said, oh, I think it probably came out
[23:28.040 --> 23:29.040]  of a lab.
[23:29.040 --> 23:31.440]  Yesterday it was, it may have come out of a lab.
[23:31.440 --> 23:33.760]  See how he's walking that up to the line?
[23:33.760 --> 23:37.160]  Because he knows he's been caught red-handed, so he knows it's coming out, and he thinks
[23:37.160 --> 23:38.160]  you don't have a memory.
[23:38.160 --> 23:40.880]  So he wants you to remember, oh, Fauci, he's the authority.
[23:40.880 --> 23:44.520]  He told me it came from a lab, even though I have dozens of videos.
[23:44.520 --> 23:48.360]  We can play them right now, if you'd like.
[23:48.360 --> 23:50.880]  It's preposterous to say it came from a lab.
[23:50.880 --> 23:52.240]  That's ridiculous.
[23:52.240 --> 23:54.600]  I'm not connected to the Wuhan lab.
[23:54.600 --> 23:56.920]  I'm not connected to gain of function.
[23:56.920 --> 23:59.040]  I've never heard of such a thing.
[23:59.040 --> 24:04.240]  We have all videos of him, it is good to be the chairman of the gain of function committee
[24:04.240 --> 24:10.600]  and our studies on gain of function at more than 20 universities, including Chapel Hill.
[24:10.600 --> 24:17.080]  I mean, we have, Trump will be challenged by a major outbreak within two years, guaranteed.
[24:17.080 --> 24:18.080]  2017.
[24:18.080 --> 24:22.640]  I mean, I can play you the damn clips, you've all heard them.
[24:22.640 --> 24:23.640]  That's just one more.
[24:23.640 --> 24:27.320]  I can do the whole show on that.
[24:27.320 --> 24:35.480]  I've got like 20 bombshells right here today.
[24:35.480 --> 24:41.560]  And then Greg Riesch knocked one out of the park because you've all heard how they would
[24:41.560 --> 24:46.720]  do a PCR test at 40 cycles, it's a UN said to.
[24:46.720 --> 24:51.040]  And the inventor of the PCR test said, if you get up to 39 or 40 revolutions, you'll
[24:51.040 --> 24:54.640]  find uranium in a test that isn't there.
[24:54.640 --> 24:58.240]  Because if you just turn it up, it'll find it.
[24:58.240 --> 25:01.320]  It's like turning the exposure up on a camera.
[25:01.320 --> 25:07.640]  You can turn it all the way to 100 and it'll be in a dark room, it'll still be blown out.
[25:07.640 --> 25:15.400]  So by the way, that the inventor conveniently died of a super fast respiratory illness,
[25:15.400 --> 25:20.520]  which they do have weaponized versions of viruses that only kill you with the generation
[25:20.520 --> 25:25.840]  you're given, then they mutate into a non-harmful type right after.
[25:25.840 --> 25:29.960]  And they just simply sprayed into your ventilation systems early in the morning or your sleep
[25:29.960 --> 25:32.200]  and then you and your whole family die.
[25:32.200 --> 25:35.080]  It's very enjoyable to be hit by it, I'm told.
[25:35.080 --> 25:38.160]  I'm going to leave it at that, I'm going to stop right there.
[25:38.160 --> 25:40.680]  So that's the way this stuff goes.
[25:40.680 --> 25:42.280]  So they've got real stuff.
[25:42.280 --> 25:48.560]  And again, it mutates as a very short half-life, but it gets in your body, replicates, kills
[25:48.560 --> 25:49.560]  you and that's it.
[25:49.560 --> 25:51.160]  There's lots of real stuff going on.
[25:51.160 --> 25:55.480]  And what they made at the lab is a five-virus chimero.
[25:55.480 --> 25:58.640]  So when people saw it, they get scared of it around the world and go, whoa, what is
[25:58.640 --> 25:59.640]  this?
[25:59.640 --> 26:04.040]  Well, it's only has really good gain of function, meaning it spreads really well and it kills
[26:04.040 --> 26:09.920]  people that have low immunity, compromised immune systems, really, really bad preexisting
[26:09.920 --> 26:17.880]  conditions and are extremely old and of course have low vitamins and minerals that are malnourished.
[26:17.880 --> 26:21.120]  But that's the other big bombshell today that we'll cover when we come back first.
[26:21.120 --> 26:26.560]  And an incredible report filed Friday night, I had to follow so many important reports
[26:26.560 --> 26:27.560]  on Friday night as well.
[26:27.560 --> 26:28.560]  You just get busy.
[26:28.560 --> 26:29.880]  It's the end of the week supposedly to get it out.
[26:29.880 --> 26:33.360]  It's the worst time to release something, but Gregory's put it out on Friday night just
[26:33.360 --> 26:38.280]  like I put out our big report on the doctor in 2009 that warned of them using the threat
[26:38.280 --> 26:42.120]  of a virus to bring in a vaccine that's actually the soft-kill weapon.
[26:42.120 --> 26:45.640]  I've already played that for you, but when we come back, we're going to play the new
[26:45.640 --> 26:52.720]  report that is so incredibly important, and I'm actually looking for my video list here.
[26:52.720 --> 26:54.320]  I think I brought that into your studio.
[26:54.320 --> 27:00.440]  I don't have that, so I'll need to get that video list here in the break.
[27:00.440 --> 27:07.240]  Note to self, and it goes to the inventor of the PCR test dying conveniently last year
[27:07.240 --> 27:13.320]  or 2019, right as all this was being released, because he was going around and confronting
[27:13.320 --> 27:18.560]  Fauci and others and saying to them, I know you're a fraud.
[27:18.560 --> 27:19.560]  I know you're a scammer.
[27:19.560 --> 27:23.800]  Basically, he was also exposing Theranos that Bill Gates was the main financier of with
[27:23.800 --> 27:29.200]  the woman claiming they had a test that was similar to PCR that would find cancer, everything
[27:29.200 --> 27:32.400]  else, and then they were doing surgeries on hundreds of thousands of people.
[27:32.400 --> 27:36.040]  They were sucking millions of dollars out of folks with the Theranos machine that was
[27:36.040 --> 27:40.840]  basically a scam the same way, which they now admit to scam, by the way, the mysterious
[27:40.840 --> 27:47.000]  death of Dr. Fauci's most notable critic, 729,000 views went up Friday.
[27:47.000 --> 27:49.600]  It needs 100 million views, folks.
[27:49.600 --> 27:54.960]  Get it, show it to everyone you know, and it will dovetail with the report I have that's
[27:54.960 --> 28:02.360]  on infowars.com, an extremely important article out of zero hedge, caught red-handed, CDC
[28:02.360 --> 28:06.560]  changes test thresholds to virtually eliminate new COVID cases among the facts.
[28:06.560 --> 28:11.720]  Now, wait, it's not just when Biden finally got in on January 20th, the next day he said,
[28:11.720 --> 28:17.800]  okay, now you do 29 revolutions or 28 revolutions.
[28:17.800 --> 28:18.800]  My memory, it's a 29.
[28:18.800 --> 28:24.000]  He did 28 even lower, where you almost always get a false negative, even if you're positive
[28:24.000 --> 28:25.000]  or something.
[28:25.000 --> 28:29.440]  But you cycle it up because it's doubling each time exponential to above 38 or so you
[28:29.440 --> 28:32.360]  always get a false positive.
[28:32.360 --> 28:35.080]  They already did that to get all the false positives.
[28:35.080 --> 28:40.600]  Now they've dialed it back for people that are vaccinated to 28, so they never show that
[28:40.600 --> 28:44.040]  the vaccine doesn't work, which is incredible, because, of course, it can't work for something
[28:44.040 --> 28:45.560]  that was already a fraud.
[28:45.560 --> 28:46.560]  But it gets better.
[28:46.560 --> 28:53.440]  If you haven't been vaccinated, it's still turned up at 40 to give you false positives.
[28:53.440 --> 29:00.000]  I mean, just total computer run fraud in your face, we'll be right back.
[29:00.000 --> 29:08.480]  Your brain, your heart, your bones, your liver, your eyes, everything has a better shot at
[29:08.480 --> 29:11.480]  surviving in this crazy environment when you have high-quality fish oil.
[29:11.480 --> 29:12.760]  We've got the best out there.
[29:12.760 --> 29:18.200]  We have the highest grade of fish oil available, and what it does for your body is simply amazing.
[29:18.200 --> 29:21.240]  Everybody already knows what high-quality fish oil does, and it costs us even more to
[29:21.240 --> 29:25.280]  put it through a process to remove any trace mercury that's in it, so this is also clean
[29:25.280 --> 29:26.280]  fish oil.
[29:26.280 --> 29:29.200]  It's been sold out for months, but it's back in stock 50% off.
[29:29.200 --> 29:32.280]  Fish oil oil is set to sell out, and it's amazing as well.
[29:32.280 --> 29:38.280]  It's at 25% off, but when you get them both together in a combo, it's 50% off as well.
[29:38.280 --> 29:43.000]  Ultimate fish oil, now back in stock at infoarstore.com, and when I forget to take it, I really
[29:43.000 --> 29:44.000]  feel it.
[29:44.000 --> 29:46.920]  When I take a couple of them before I go to sleep at night, it makes my dreams even more
[29:46.920 --> 29:47.920]  amazing.
[29:47.920 --> 29:51.080]  Unless you thought I was joking, you've tried it out, and most of you have been blown away.
[29:51.080 --> 29:54.400]  Get your fish oil today at infoarstore.com.
[29:54.400 --> 30:00.920]  Ultimate fish oil, infoarstore.com, infoarstore.com, infoarstore.com.
[30:00.920 --> 30:07.320]  Globalist puppet Joe Biden wasted no time blaming Russia with no evidence for the shutdown
[30:07.320 --> 30:12.440]  of the East Coast Gasoline Pipeline that goes from Houston right up through New York City
[30:12.440 --> 30:16.640]  and supplies more than half of the gasoline to the East Coast, but who is it that actually
[30:16.640 --> 30:22.560]  shut down the main pipeline from Canada through the Midwest to Houston to refine the oil that's
[30:22.560 --> 30:25.360]  then turned into gas and sent to the East Coast?
[30:25.360 --> 30:26.360]  That's right.
[30:26.360 --> 30:30.680]  Joe Biden shut down the Keystone Pipeline right after it was completed.
[30:30.680 --> 30:32.840]  Joe Biden did that to America.
[30:32.840 --> 30:33.840]  He has the history.
[30:33.840 --> 30:34.840]  He has the background.
[30:34.840 --> 30:38.360]  He's the one that promised to, quote, get us off of fossil fuels.
[30:38.360 --> 30:42.720]  He's the one that's tried to extend the lockdowns of the country.
[30:42.720 --> 30:46.800]  Remember, ladies and gentlemen, that the New World Order wants a post-industrial world,
[30:46.800 --> 30:51.280]  and they want the United States, Europe, and Australia crippled so communist China can't
[30:51.280 --> 30:52.280]  be dominant.
[30:52.280 --> 30:53.840]  It's not Russia that's the enemy.
[30:53.840 --> 30:58.560]  It's communist China, and there are millions like Joe Biden in control of the White House.
[30:58.560 --> 30:59.560]  That's the facts.
[30:59.560 --> 31:00.760]  That's the information.
[31:00.760 --> 31:06.040]  The BioPros are the new non-GMO pollution solution using eco-friendly products to treat
[31:06.040 --> 31:08.040]  everyday problems while supporting our environment.
[31:08.040 --> 31:13.040]  For the first time, the BioPros are bringing to the public market a suite of bioremediation
[31:13.040 --> 31:14.880]  products to the everyday consumer.
[31:14.880 --> 31:19.360]  Their first product they are launching is called BioSeptic Pro, a product specifically
[31:19.360 --> 31:21.800]  designed to establish a healthy septic system.
[31:21.800 --> 31:26.760]  BioSeptic Pro contains live microorganisms, not traditional enzymes like its competitors.
[31:26.760 --> 31:28.680]  This stuff lives in your septic system.
[31:28.680 --> 31:31.320]  It's really like probiotics for your septic tank.
[31:31.320 --> 31:36.240]  Say goodbye to septic problems, gas buildup, and odor guaranteed.
[31:36.240 --> 31:39.940]  BioSeptic Pro is light years ahead of traditional septic treatments.
[31:39.940 --> 31:44.200]  They have a revolutionary patent delivery system that carries live microorganisms to
[31:44.200 --> 31:49.200]  treat the problem at its core, making their products up to 100 times more effective than
[31:49.200 --> 31:50.200]  its competitors.
[31:50.200 --> 31:54.360]  BioSeptic Pro is safe for plumbing, human, animal, and aquatic life.

[32:10.800 --> 32:13.400]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[32:13.400 --> 32:14.920]  They know you're angry.
[32:14.920 --> 32:19.240]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool
[32:19.240 --> 32:20.240]  we've got.

[33:03.640 --> 33:16.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:16.600 --> 33:21.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, more massive COVID-19 news just brought here in the break.
[33:21.120 --> 33:23.760]  Wait until you hear this.
[33:23.760 --> 33:24.760]  Wow.
[33:24.760 --> 33:31.240]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[33:31.240 --> 33:36.600]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[33:36.600 --> 33:50.160]  Now, if you'll remember, back in January of last year, January 28, Dr. Boyle, Francis
[33:50.160 --> 33:55.640]  Boyle, who wrote the U.S. Biological Weapons Law and basically wrote the UN World Treaty
[33:55.640 --> 34:02.600]  and was the top UN war crimes prosecutor, prosecuted a lot of people, some good, some
[34:02.600 --> 34:03.600]  bad.
[34:03.600 --> 34:07.720]  One thing is that, I mean, he's high level, not like Brad Pitt, ooh, it's a movie star,
[34:07.720 --> 34:12.800]  but I mean, when it comes to government stuff, he's rock star.
[34:12.800 --> 34:18.600]  And he put a report out saying, this was made in a lab, here's the evidence, I went and
[34:18.600 --> 34:19.600]  checked it.
[34:19.600 --> 34:23.920]  He was pointing at an Indian Institute and others that have gene scanning equipment that's
[34:23.920 --> 34:24.920]  billions of dollars.
[34:24.920 --> 34:32.520]  We got the same stuff here, even better, and they said, this is man-made.
[34:32.520 --> 34:37.040]  And then I had Boyle on in early February about it.
[34:37.040 --> 34:46.320]  And then in March, the discoverer of HIV, he won a Nobel Prize, came out and said, I've
[34:46.320 --> 34:53.000]  looked at the gene scans, the RNA scans, off of the European scan, and it says what the
[34:53.000 --> 34:55.160]  Indians found is accurate.
[34:55.160 --> 35:02.680]  Well, now a major global medical foundation, the Rayer Foundation, has thrown out a statement
[35:02.680 --> 35:08.080]  from the doctor, I'll cover it next segment, saying the vaccine is dangerous, it's not
[35:08.080 --> 35:11.920]  a vaccine and it will cause spreading of deadly variants.
[35:11.920 --> 35:12.920]  Boom.
[35:12.920 --> 35:18.440]  One of the top neurologists in the world says what we've been saying for a year about the
[35:18.440 --> 35:23.240]  spreading and about the shedding.
[35:23.240 --> 35:29.000]  That's what I'm telling you, the whole house of cards hasn't fallen, it's exploded.
[35:29.000 --> 35:31.960]  I mean, wait till I hit.
[35:31.960 --> 35:39.120]  They had this weekend Bloomberg, USA Today, CNN that I know of, the LA Times and a bunch
[35:39.120 --> 35:43.240]  of others, because they all get a talking point and they all publish basically the same
[35:43.240 --> 35:44.240]  article.
[35:44.240 --> 35:48.480]  Just suddenly everywhere, we need to make people take shots, we need to arrest them, we need
[35:48.480 --> 35:51.760]  to take their bank accounts, we need to take their kids, we need to not let them get on
[35:51.760 --> 36:00.320]  buses or trains, we need to remember all the snopes and the news guard run by Bill Gates,
[36:00.320 --> 36:06.080]  he owns it, said that Bill Gates, he wasn't involved in the Moderna shot, but he was or
[36:06.080 --> 36:10.800]  he wasn't involved in being banned in India, which he was.
[36:10.800 --> 36:14.920]  Remember they were out there saying, oh, it's just preposterous, there's no shedding of
[36:14.920 --> 36:17.520]  any type.
[36:17.520 --> 36:21.440]  No one wants to ever have a thing called a vaccine passport, no one wants you to have
[36:21.440 --> 36:25.720]  a chip, that's even more preposterous, and all we had was their own admissions and white
[36:25.720 --> 36:31.640]  papers from the Carnegie Endowment, the Rockefeller Endowment, the Bill Gates Endowment, and you're
[36:31.640 --> 36:33.440]  like, well, who cares about their endowments?
[36:33.440 --> 36:35.960]  Do you know who runs the CIA right now?
[36:35.960 --> 36:45.400]  The former director of the Carnegie Endowment for Peace.
[36:45.400 --> 36:52.080]  They have been positioning themselves for this takeover for a long, long time, and so
[36:52.080 --> 36:57.000]  I don't just, people keep going, how did Jones just guess they'd have a thing called a vaccine
[36:57.000 --> 36:58.000]  passport?
[36:58.000 --> 37:02.840]  I didn't guess any of it, and that's why I keep saying stop giving me credit and understand
[37:02.840 --> 37:08.120]  this is a takeover, this is all written and what they're going to do, and I told you they're
[37:08.120 --> 37:11.960]  going to put the clamp on you a lot longer than they said, then they'll take it off a
[37:11.960 --> 37:15.560]  little bit and then, boom, they're going to bring it down even harder.
[37:15.560 --> 37:21.640]  They've already done that in Australia and the UK and Spain and Canada.
[37:21.640 --> 37:25.320]  I told you eight, nine months ago, I said, here's the government document, they're going
[37:25.320 --> 37:28.080]  to have it locked down two, three, and then four will be permanent.
[37:28.080 --> 37:30.720]  They're already in lockdown three, and they've now announced lockdown four.
[37:30.720 --> 37:35.760]  On the very dates the document said, but don't worry, they had a Canadian newspaper debunk
[37:35.760 --> 37:37.240]  the document we had.
[37:37.240 --> 37:43.400]  The damn document was from the UN, they just put the Labour Party, Liberal Party's header
[37:43.400 --> 37:50.120]  on it, and then we had speeches of their regional health department heads reading from the damn
[37:50.120 --> 37:51.120]  thing.
[37:51.120 --> 38:01.640]  Oh my goodness, so we're going to get to that, but first this, caught red-handed ladies
[38:01.640 --> 38:05.080]  and gentlemen.
[38:05.080 --> 38:09.800]  The article is on infowars.com, and if you care about your freedom, you better go read
[38:09.800 --> 38:11.200]  it, you better share it.
[38:11.200 --> 38:15.120]  I need your help to get out of this, you need my help, we're in deep crap, but we can beat
[38:15.120 --> 38:18.440]  this if we admit how much trouble we're in.
[38:18.440 --> 38:22.040]  And it's a detailed article out of zero heads, it's up on infowars.com, here it is, caught
[38:22.040 --> 38:32.960]  red-handed CDC changes test thresholds to virtually enhance new COVID cases among VACs, to virtually
[38:32.960 --> 38:33.960]  eliminate.
[38:33.960 --> 38:39.560]  So caught red-handed CDC changes test thresholds to virtually eliminate new COVID cases among
[38:39.560 --> 38:43.360]  the VACs, and then it lays it all out how they set the PCR test where no one will ever
[38:43.360 --> 38:48.440]  be positive, but they're going to keep it at the fake level for fake positives for everybody
[38:48.440 --> 38:52.400]  else who isn't vaccinated, and then penalize you and then later they're going to turn it
[38:52.400 --> 38:57.240]  up even higher where you could never travel, like Hawaii and other places and want you
[38:57.240 --> 39:00.560]  to take a PCR test where you can go there, well they just turn the level up where you
[39:00.560 --> 39:01.560]  can't travel.
[39:01.560 --> 39:06.560]  Here's Greg Rayser's report.
[39:06.560 --> 39:14.880]  Dr. Kerry Mullis was awarded the Nobel Prize for his invention of the Polymers Chain Reaction,
[39:14.880 --> 39:16.320]  the PCR.
[39:16.320 --> 39:22.480]  The PCR is a method of analysis and wasn't designed to test for a virus, Mullis explains
[39:22.480 --> 39:23.480]  why.
[39:23.480 --> 39:28.680]  And with PCR, if you do it well, you can find almost anything in anybody, it starts making
[39:28.680 --> 39:32.840]  you believe in the sort of Buddhist notion that everything is contained and everything
[39:32.840 --> 39:33.840]  else, right?
[39:33.840 --> 39:38.480]  I mean, because if you can amplify one single molecule up to something that you can really
[39:38.480 --> 39:45.320]  measure, which PCR can do, then there's just very few molecules that you don't have at
[39:45.320 --> 39:47.600]  least one single one of them in your body, okay?
[39:47.600 --> 39:51.840]  So that could be thought of as a misuse of it just to claim that it's meaningful.
[39:51.840 --> 39:57.680]  The PCR test can potentially find anything you are looking for, depending on how high
[39:57.680 --> 39:59.200]  you turn it up.
[39:59.200 --> 40:01.640]  And this is exactly what has been done.
[40:01.640 --> 40:08.320]  The official protocol given for the PCR testing of COVID-19 created a floodgate of false positives
[40:08.320 --> 40:10.280]  to skew the results.
[40:10.280 --> 40:14.160]  They call it asymptomatic because it's a lie.
[40:14.160 --> 40:18.560]  These people don't have symptoms because they don't have COVID-19.
[40:18.560 --> 40:23.400]  They do it today because they've done it in the past and always gotten away with it.
[40:23.400 --> 40:29.360]  Thirty years ago, Anthony Fauci, head of the NIH, made a name for himself by pushing for
[40:29.360 --> 40:36.200]  higher doses of the deadly drug AZT, an old cancer chemotherapy too dangerous for approval,
[40:36.200 --> 40:38.720]  onto AIDS patients.
[40:38.720 --> 40:44.120]  Kerry Mullis was hired to measure HIV in people's blood samples with his PCR.
[40:44.120 --> 40:48.520]  He was working under the premise that HIV was the probable cause of AIDS.
[40:48.520 --> 40:52.800]  But when he went looking for the proof, he found there was none.
[40:52.800 --> 40:54.160]  They just made it up.
[40:54.160 --> 40:55.160]  What is that paper?
[40:55.160 --> 40:57.080]  Who do I go to for that?
[40:57.080 --> 41:01.240]  And I looked around, I asked a couple of ourologists at that company, and they said, no, you don't
[41:01.240 --> 41:02.240]  have to reference that.
[41:02.240 --> 41:06.040]  I said, I have to reference that because I don't know where that came from.
[41:06.040 --> 41:07.040]  How do I know that?
[41:07.040 --> 41:10.000]  And it turned out that nobody knew it.
[41:10.000 --> 41:13.040]  And I was getting really freaked about that.
[41:13.040 --> 41:16.120]  That's when I first started saying they don't know.
[41:16.120 --> 41:17.120]  Nobody really knows.
[41:17.120 --> 41:19.880]  This whole thing is a big sham.
[41:19.880 --> 41:25.440]  Mullis pointed out how the CDC was losing money and how the HIV-AIDS connection brought
[41:25.440 --> 41:32.120]  their profits back in the black and how the men at the highest levels were all in on it.
[41:32.120 --> 41:34.680]  Kerry Mullis knew these men were dangerous.
[41:34.680 --> 41:38.720]  They don't want people like me walking up and asking them those kind of questions.
[41:38.720 --> 41:44.200]  And they're willing to go to great lengths to prevent that.
[41:44.200 --> 41:45.960]  They're out on a limb.
[41:45.960 --> 41:48.120]  I wouldn't want to be there with them.
[41:48.120 --> 41:50.600]  But he was still outspoken.
[41:50.600 --> 41:55.520]  When ABC's Nightline approached him about doing a documentary on his work, Mullis convinced
[41:55.520 --> 42:01.080]  them to cover the HIV debate after nearly a decade of ignoring it.
[42:01.080 --> 42:06.680]  In a 1994 interview with Celia Farber for Spin Magazine, Kerry Mullis expressed how
[42:06.680 --> 42:10.520]  he really wanted to expose Anthony Fauci and Robert Gallo.
[42:10.520 --> 42:15.320]  He said that he'd be willing to chase the little bastard from his car to his office,
[42:15.320 --> 42:21.840]  a Nobel Prize winner trying to ask a simple question from those who spent $22 billion
[42:21.840 --> 42:24.400]  and killed 100,000 people.
[42:24.400 --> 42:26.120]  It has to be on TV.
[42:26.120 --> 42:29.720]  I'm not unwilling to do something like that.
[42:29.720 --> 42:33.160]  Unfortunately, not many people were listening back then.
[42:33.160 --> 42:40.600]  And on August 7, 2019, just about three months before the first utterance of COVID-19, Kerry
[42:40.600 --> 42:48.880]  Mullis, age 74, a Nobel Prize winner, inventor of the PCR test, a man who was once willing
[42:48.880 --> 42:54.720]  and eager to expose Anthony Fauci, quietly died of pneumonia.
[42:54.720 --> 42:59.000]  The timing of it all is mysterious to many of us.
[42:59.000 --> 43:03.280]  Warning, warning, warning.
[43:03.280 --> 43:08.160]  The globalists have launched a massive counter-offensive against populist forces worldwide.
[43:08.160 --> 43:09.160]  They are censoring.
[43:09.160 --> 43:10.160]  They are attacking.
[43:10.160 --> 43:12.680]  They are arresting patriots all over the world.
[43:12.680 --> 43:17.280]  Churches in Europe, Australia, the U.K. and Canada, and even California and New York are
[43:17.280 --> 43:21.400]  being swat-teamed and clothed because they're non-essential.
[43:21.400 --> 43:23.480]  The tyranny is incredible.
[43:23.480 --> 43:28.240]  But in areas like Texas and South Dakota and Florida, where we have a history of more liberty,
[43:28.240 --> 43:31.040]  all the lockdowns are over, ladies and gentlemen.
[43:31.040 --> 43:32.600]  This is martial law.
[43:32.600 --> 43:35.520]  This has all been a massive martial law drill.
[43:35.520 --> 43:39.480]  And now it's more important than ever to spread the word about info wars and to support info
[43:39.480 --> 43:40.480]  wars.
[43:40.480 --> 43:43.760]  We have three of our best-selling products selling out, but despite that, they're all
[43:43.760 --> 43:45.440]  massively discounted.
[43:45.440 --> 43:48.040]  Turbo force, it's 40 percent off.
[43:48.040 --> 43:50.840]  We've got ultimate fish oil, 50 percent off.
[43:50.840 --> 43:54.040]  And winter sun for your immune system, it's 50 percent off as well.
[43:54.040 --> 44:00.640]  Best deal ever, take advantage of it at infowarstore.com and fund the info war.
[44:00.640 --> 44:04.560]  One of the most common questions I get on air, but also off air when I'm just out and
[44:04.560 --> 44:09.440]  about is, Alex, what do I say to my family about the vaccines?
[44:09.440 --> 44:10.960]  How do I warn them?
[44:10.960 --> 44:14.000]  Well, the problem is there's so many problems with it.
[44:14.000 --> 44:15.000]  So many facts.
[44:15.000 --> 44:18.400]  It's the history of contaminated vaccines, the fact that they have liability protection
[44:18.400 --> 44:23.160]  in the U.S. and Europe, the fact that they've been caught adding sterilants and cancer
[44:23.160 --> 44:27.720]  viruses and other things to vaccines, and the whole history of secret experimentation
[44:27.720 --> 44:31.480]  on at-risk groups of poor blacks, poor whites, Native Americans.
[44:31.480 --> 44:32.480]  The list goes on and on.
[44:32.480 --> 44:38.320]  But what about the fact that Fauci testified to Congress and so did the head of the CDC
[44:38.320 --> 44:45.800]  in late May of 2021 that around half of the NIH CDC staff, medical doctors, virologist
[44:45.800 --> 44:48.560]  scientists have refused to take the vaccine until they get safe?
[44:48.560 --> 44:52.680]  Yeah, I think what half of the doctors are scared to take it, and it's the same thing
[44:52.680 --> 44:55.760]  in the private practices out there, similar numbers, that that's not something I'm going
[44:55.760 --> 44:56.760]  to be taking.
[44:56.760 --> 44:58.000]  That's very, very simple.
[44:58.000 --> 45:01.000]  There's your answer.
[45:01.000 --> 45:06.280]  The federal government commissioned secret radiation experiments on thousands of non-consenting
[45:06.280 --> 45:12.440]  patients, hundreds of hospitals in the U.S. injected healthy men, women and children with
[45:12.440 --> 45:18.760]  uranium and plutonium at dosage levels ranging from non-therapeutic to lethal, killing many
[45:18.760 --> 45:19.760]  of the test subjects.
[45:19.760 --> 45:24.920]  In-game blueprint for global enslavement is one of the most important films ever made.
[45:24.920 --> 45:28.640]  Fourteen years ago, we tracked the document of the Bilderberg Group's activities and their
[45:28.640 --> 45:32.040]  plan for a great reset using the threat of a fake virus.
[45:32.040 --> 45:33.600]  The film now is more important than ever.
[45:33.600 --> 45:36.480]  When it shot to number one on Amazon last year, they banned it.
[45:36.480 --> 45:42.440]  We have it back in print, available now at infowarstore.com, selling them as low as $3.95
[45:42.440 --> 45:46.000]  a piece of the environment bulk, and there's a zero country code, so anywhere on the planet
[45:46.000 --> 45:47.000]  you can make copies.
[45:47.000 --> 45:48.480]  In fact, I want you to make copies.
[45:48.480 --> 45:54.320]  You are the Paul Revere's, 1776 Worldwide, 1776 Worldwide, in-game blueprint for global
[45:54.320 --> 46:04.280]  enslavement, available now at infowarstore.com, selling them as low as $3.95 a piece of the
[46:04.280 --> 46:08.160]  environment bulk, and there's a zero country code, so anywhere on the planet you can make
[46:08.160 --> 46:09.160]  copies.
[46:09.160 --> 46:10.160]  In-game blueprint for global enslavement, available now at infowarstore.com.
[46:10.160 --> 46:11.160]  Gerald of South Carolina, go ahead, you're on the air, trying to move quicker.
[46:11.160 --> 46:12.160]  Hey, Alex.
[46:12.160 --> 46:13.160]  Welcome.
[46:13.160 --> 46:14.160]  Would like to say first off, thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all this stupidity.
[46:14.160 --> 46:15.160]  Wanted to warn people, I've been trying to get ahold of you for a year, okay?
[46:15.160 --> 46:19.960]  I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away.
[46:19.960 --> 46:21.460]  Living defense saved my life.
[46:21.460 --> 46:25.800]  They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me.
[46:25.800 --> 46:27.240]  Living defense brought me back.
[46:27.240 --> 46:32.960]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible, Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[46:32.960 --> 46:39.960]  This is Matthew 24, verse 9, then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill
[46:39.960 --> 46:46.720]  you and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake, and then shall many be offended
[46:46.720 --> 46:50.120]  and shall betray one another and shall hate one another.
[46:50.120 --> 46:51.800]  Right where we're at, brother.
[46:51.800 --> 46:56.240]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country, no matter what they say,
[46:56.240 --> 47:03.600]  and that's why the enemy hates it, because God created this country.
[47:03.600 --> 47:20.920]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:20.920 --> 47:26.560]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, we now take you live to the Central Texas
[47:26.560 --> 47:52.560]  Command Center and the heart of the resistance, it's Alex Jones.
[47:52.560 --> 48:07.560]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are blasting out on over 200 AM and FM radio stations right
[48:07.560 --> 48:14.000]  now, over 100 TV and cable stations thanks to you, and of course, infowars.com, newswars.com,
[48:14.000 --> 48:18.920]  band.video, with millions of folks that tune in every day to the live streams and also
[48:18.920 --> 48:23.440]  the restreams and all the different posted videos, interviews, and special reports.
[48:23.440 --> 48:26.280]  Again, thank you so much for joining us.
[48:26.280 --> 48:32.240]  If you try to share infowars.com or band.video or some of our other main sites on Twitter,
[48:32.240 --> 48:37.640]  on Facebook, the URLs are blocked if you put them as a URL, if you put them up as an image
[48:37.640 --> 48:42.920]  or as a meme, or you can put dashes out or spell it out differently and explain you're
[48:42.920 --> 48:46.400]  being censored, and then people show extra interest in things that are censored and tend
[48:46.400 --> 48:50.720]  to check it out for themselves, and that can save them and save others if they understand
[48:50.720 --> 48:51.720]  what's happening.
[48:51.720 --> 48:56.000]  The people are destroyed for lack of knowledge, the Bible tells us.
[48:56.000 --> 49:02.520]  My people perish for lack of knowledge.
[49:02.520 --> 49:08.440]  And so since we launched band.video a few years ago, they began to ban the URL.
[49:08.440 --> 49:14.080]  And so starting back around six months before the election, I guess about a year ago now,
[49:14.080 --> 49:18.080]  they completely banned sharing band.video on Twitter and other platforms.
[49:18.080 --> 49:25.520]  We started creating new names that are a new URL but goes to the main site and indexes
[49:25.520 --> 49:26.520]  all the links.
[49:26.520 --> 49:32.200]  So you can share links from that URL when you go to the new URL, because the last one
[49:32.200 --> 49:35.960]  we had banned this.tv, did get banned last week.
[49:35.960 --> 49:43.880]  Well, now we have freeworldnews.tv, freeworldnews.tv, the last one lasted for four months.
[49:43.880 --> 49:44.880]  Let's see them banned.
[49:44.880 --> 49:45.880]  I'm sure they will.
[49:45.880 --> 49:46.880]  Maybe they're there tomorrow.
[49:46.880 --> 49:47.880]  Maybe in six months.
[49:47.880 --> 49:48.880]  I don't know.
[49:48.880 --> 49:49.880]  Freeworldnews.tv.
[49:49.880 --> 49:52.360]  We'll be able to say, hey, they banned freeworldnews.
[49:52.360 --> 49:54.400]  They're against the freeworld.
[49:54.400 --> 49:55.400]  Freeworldnews.tv.
[49:55.400 --> 49:56.400]  It's a great URL.
[49:56.400 --> 49:58.400]  In fact, I like it so much.
[49:58.400 --> 50:03.760]  I'm going to create a new website, a new news site with it for some new special podcasts
[50:03.760 --> 50:08.560]  and shows we're about to launch, because that might be a better name than even info wars.
[50:08.560 --> 50:11.240]  Freeworldnews.
[50:11.240 --> 50:15.040]  And so you just go to freeworldnews.com and you share all the Band-Ought video videos
[50:15.040 --> 50:22.040]  with that URL, and it gets around the censors, because again, we've been live for 50 minutes
[50:22.040 --> 50:33.080]  on this Sunday, May 23rd, Transfusion, and we've already broken the report about Fauci
[50:33.080 --> 50:34.080]  coming out.
[50:34.080 --> 50:38.160]  We've got the video saying, oh, I think it probably came out of the lab, or it may have
[50:38.160 --> 50:39.320]  come out of the lab.
[50:39.320 --> 50:44.640]  When he said that was preposterous and insane, when he ran the Wuhan lab program, that was
[50:44.640 --> 50:45.640]  the exact viruses.
[50:45.640 --> 50:46.640]  I mean, this is insane.
[50:46.640 --> 50:50.560]  And then, of course, we have the director of the program under Fauci, who got money directly
[50:50.560 --> 50:58.960]  from Fauci and Obama, 3.7 million, for gain of function with bat coronaviruses mixed with
[50:58.960 --> 51:10.040]  humans, and HIV, we have that information breaking today.
[51:10.040 --> 51:15.680]  And now we have Bloomberg and all these other publications saying, let's have forced inoculations,
[51:15.680 --> 51:21.200]  yes, and a medical ID, and arrest people that don't have it.
[51:21.200 --> 51:24.920]  He told you that was coming, because Klaus Schwab wrote a book five years ago saying
[51:24.920 --> 51:30.080]  it was, and then gave a French TV interview on national TV, where he said, you will all
[51:30.080 --> 51:36.880]  have a medical ID worldwide run by the UN, and after you accept that, next will be microchips
[51:36.880 --> 51:39.880]  under your skin.
[51:39.880 --> 51:46.240]  And now in Texas, the US Army's out basically intimidating people into taking shots inside
[51:46.240 --> 51:49.480]  convenience stores.
[51:49.480 --> 51:53.440]  The military is fighting against taking it themselves, but there they are getting the
[51:53.440 --> 51:54.440]  public to take it.
[51:54.440 --> 51:57.400]  So if you're not against this young man in uniform, he has nothing to do with what he's
[51:57.400 --> 51:58.400]  injecting in you.
[51:58.400 --> 52:03.480]  But the news is like, blacks don't trust the vaccine because they've been experimented
[52:03.480 --> 52:04.480]  on before.
[52:04.480 --> 52:09.480]  But don't worry, it's a black nurse giving it to you, as if she is the one that cooked
[52:09.480 --> 52:10.480]  it up.
[52:10.480 --> 52:12.840]  This is all an exercise in pure evil.
[52:12.840 --> 52:20.040]  And then we get all the news, I have more of it today, that they banned the five vaccines
[52:20.040 --> 52:30.840]  that are now authorized in the US under emergency use, never tested, in hundreds of countries.
[52:30.840 --> 52:34.520]  The mRNA vaccines are banned in countries like India and China.
[52:34.520 --> 52:38.640]  That's right, they won't take it, and they're not talking about making people take shots
[52:38.640 --> 52:40.120]  in communist China.
[52:40.120 --> 52:45.200]  I mean, on a scale of one to 10, making people take injections is a 10.
[52:45.200 --> 52:51.800]  And then it's a Franken-shot, and they go, oh, you're just against the science.
[52:51.800 --> 52:53.640]  Oh, no, I know all about the science.
[52:53.640 --> 52:57.720]  You guys being caught up with the years, putting syphilis in vaccines, putting sterilins in
[52:57.720 --> 52:58.720]  vaccines.
[52:58.720 --> 53:02.360]  And by the way, I love all God's children, but it's a limited hangout.
[53:02.360 --> 53:05.000]  We're like, oh, yeah, they got caught doing it to black people.
[53:05.000 --> 53:07.280]  They do it to everybody.
[53:07.280 --> 53:10.920]  Let's get that straight.
[53:10.920 --> 53:16.120]  Now, the Nobel Prize winner reveals COVID vaccine is creating variants that are more
[53:16.120 --> 53:20.640]  dangerous than the vaccine, that are more dangerous than the virus, and he goes on
[53:20.640 --> 53:24.920]  to talk about antibody-dependent enhancement, where when you've had the vaccine, now when
[53:24.920 --> 53:32.000]  you get a regular COVID virus that are everywhere, that'll now kill you in an autoimmune response,
[53:32.000 --> 53:36.760]  and they're going to call that some new disease as people start dropping dead, as is already
[53:36.760 --> 53:37.760]  happening.
[53:37.760 --> 53:41.160]  And don't worry about a vaccine for that made up crap.
[53:41.160 --> 53:43.720]  People go, well, then is the virus real?
[53:43.720 --> 53:47.200]  Yes, they cooked it up so they'd own it.
[53:47.200 --> 53:51.280]  And so people would see it and get scared of it, but it's a PCR test.
[53:51.280 --> 53:53.960]  Turned up to 40, it's almost all false positive.
[53:53.960 --> 53:57.960]  Now if you've had the vaccine, they turn it down to 28, where you can't get a positive.
[53:57.960 --> 54:01.080]  And now suddenly, oh, the vaccine's 100%.
[54:01.080 --> 54:06.440]  It's all an admitted fraud, a five-year-old that paid attention could figure this out.
[54:06.440 --> 54:11.200]  This is the science.
[54:11.200 --> 54:16.000]  The 2008 Nobel Laureate made his explosive comments as part of a larger interview with
[54:16.000 --> 54:23.120]  Pierre Brands-Sears of whole U.S. media earlier this month.
[54:23.120 --> 54:29.000]  The clip was exclusively translated for the Rare Foundation, USA, and is quite damning
[54:29.000 --> 54:32.120]  for the agenda-driven left-wing establishment.
[54:32.120 --> 54:37.120]  These are creating the variants.
[54:37.120 --> 54:44.880]  That's French virologist Nobel Prize winner, Luc Montagirner, if I pronounce that right.
[54:44.880 --> 54:49.560]  The discovery of HIV contends that it is the vaccination that is creating the variants.
[54:49.560 --> 54:55.040]  And that's why most of the people in the hospital now dying of COVID have been vaccinated.
[54:55.040 --> 54:56.440]  And that's even in the news.
[54:56.440 --> 54:57.440]  This is incredible.
[54:57.440 --> 55:00.840]  We're going to start the next hour here in a few minutes.
[55:00.840 --> 55:04.120]  We've asked how we're able to predict all that, how we're able to know what's coming
[55:04.120 --> 55:05.120]  next.
[55:05.120 --> 55:07.400]  It's because that's all I do is research these people.
[55:07.400 --> 55:10.320]  I'm going to talk about their end game, what's coming next, and I'm going to stop them
[55:10.320 --> 55:11.320]  next hour.
[55:11.320 --> 55:15.600]  But here's an important report, again, from 10 years ago that's really turning a lot
[55:15.600 --> 55:18.920]  of heads, where I predicted the lockdowns are never going to end.
[55:18.920 --> 55:20.640]  And again, they're going to bring the lockdowns back.
[55:20.640 --> 55:24.360]  They're already in place in the rest of the world, where we have some freedom in America.
[55:24.360 --> 55:28.640]  We've stopped following their orders, so they're taking some of them off for now.
[55:28.640 --> 55:32.360]  They're going to create new fear as the vaccine kills a bunch of people claiming it's a new
[55:32.360 --> 55:33.360]  deadly virus.
[55:33.360 --> 55:34.360]  Wait for that.
[55:34.360 --> 55:35.360]  Here it is.
[55:35.360 --> 55:38.840]  The Alex Jones show, there is a war on for your mind.
[55:38.840 --> 55:42.960]  I mean, I'm not even worthy to be bringing you information that's powerful.
[55:42.960 --> 55:48.080]  And I hope that you pay attention to what we cover here minute by minute, because I've
[55:48.080 --> 55:52.080]  had chills since last night.
[55:52.080 --> 55:55.160]  This just confirms everything else we've already researched.
[55:55.160 --> 56:00.880]  By the way, people always accuse me of having somebody in my ear tell me what to say or what
[56:00.880 --> 56:01.880]  to do.
[56:01.880 --> 56:03.200]  They don't tell me what to say or what to do.
[56:03.200 --> 56:04.680]  There's no teleprompter here.
[56:04.680 --> 56:09.720]  But I did ask the crew how to pronounce it, and it's Luke Montanay for the French listeners
[56:09.720 --> 56:13.000]  out there insulted by me butchering his name.
[56:13.000 --> 56:15.480]  I just realized that I went to this late.
[56:15.480 --> 56:21.480]  We won't have time to play the report, so I'll play that report next hour.
[56:21.480 --> 56:25.960]  And the full report is Video Shocks The World, Alex Jones, where you can come and lock downs
[56:25.960 --> 56:26.960]  in 2010.
[56:26.960 --> 56:30.200]  That is coming up next hour separately.
[56:30.200 --> 56:37.080]  We have been running the trifecta sale, the best deal ever on survival shield, X2, deep
[56:37.080 --> 56:42.240]  earth, crystal iodine, the good halogen, the opposite of fluoride for your pineal gland,
[56:42.240 --> 56:46.240]  your glands, your blood, your fertility, your brain, your immune system.
[56:46.240 --> 56:51.360]  It is essential for your body that the best iodine you're going to find out there.

[56:58.760 --> 57:00.560]  fish oil.
[57:00.560 --> 57:02.680]  All three of these are close to selling out.
[57:02.680 --> 57:07.360]  The fish oil is going to go off sale Tuesday morning.
[57:07.360 --> 57:10.600]  Turbo force is going to go off sale Tuesday morning.
[57:10.600 --> 57:13.840]  Survival Shield X2 is going to go off sale Tuesday morning.

[57:26.480 --> 57:29.000]  the fact they're selling out, because I want you to try them and see them.

[57:35.920 --> 57:41.760]  We also have at 40% off out of the gates, the new ultimate magnesium fizzy drink.
[57:41.760 --> 57:42.760]  Magnesium is so good for you.
[57:42.760 --> 57:44.600]  This has two types of magnesium.
[57:44.600 --> 57:46.000]  Most brands only have one.
[57:46.000 --> 57:47.000]  It's incredible.
[57:47.000 --> 57:53.800]  You can go to www.fishoilwarstore.com, we'll be right back.
[57:53.800 --> 57:58.480]  Your brain, your heart, your bones, your liver, your eyes, everything has a better shot at
[57:58.480 --> 58:01.520]  surviving in this crazy environment when you have high quality fish oil.
[58:01.520 --> 58:02.760]  We've got the best out there.
[58:02.760 --> 58:08.200]  We have the highest grade of fish oil available, and what it does for your body is simply amazing.
[58:08.200 --> 58:11.360]  Everybody already knows what high quality fish oil does, and it costs us even more to put
[58:11.360 --> 58:15.280]  it through a process to remove any trace mercury that's in it, so this is also clean
[58:15.280 --> 58:16.280]  fish oil.
[58:16.280 --> 58:19.200]  It's sold out for months, but it's back in stock 50% off.
[58:19.200 --> 58:22.280]  Grill oil is set to sell out, and it's amazing as well.
[58:22.280 --> 58:28.280]  It's at 25% off, but when you get them both together in a combo, it's 50% off as well.
[58:28.280 --> 58:33.000]  Ultimate fish oil, now back in stock at infowarstore.com, and when I forget to take it, I really
[58:33.000 --> 58:34.000]  feel it.
[58:34.000 --> 58:36.920]  When I take a couple of them before I go to sleep at night, it makes my dreams even more
[58:36.920 --> 58:37.920]  amazing.
[58:37.920 --> 58:39.080]  Blizzard thought I was joking.
[58:39.080 --> 58:41.000]  You've tried it out, and most of you have been blown away.
[58:41.000 --> 58:44.400]  Get your fish oil today at infowarstore.com.
[58:44.400 --> 58:54.400]  I'm not going to say this five times in a row to be obnoxious.
[58:54.400 --> 58:57.920]  I'm saying it because it's the key to victory over these criminals.
[58:57.920 --> 59:05.560]  Last week, the arch-globalist Fauci admitted that roughly half of the CDC's, top brass,
[59:05.560 --> 59:10.360]  and workers, medical doctors, scientists, nurses, you name it, have taken the so-called
[59:10.360 --> 59:11.360]  COVID-19 Frankenstein.
[59:11.360 --> 59:14.120]  I'm going to say it the second time.
[59:14.120 --> 59:21.920]  Around half of the doctors at the CDC and NIH refused to take the Frankenshots.
[59:21.920 --> 59:23.480]  They don't trust it.
[59:23.480 --> 59:24.800]  You shouldn't trust it.
[59:24.800 --> 59:27.600]  The vaccines have been banned in most countries around the world.
[59:27.600 --> 59:30.800]  This is an attack on the American people, on the people of the world.
[59:30.800 --> 59:34.200]  This is an absolute red flag smoking gun.
[59:34.200 --> 59:37.000]  Again, let me say it two more times.
[59:37.000 --> 59:41.480]  Around half of the individuals that work at the NIH and CDC, the medical staff refused
[59:41.480 --> 59:42.480]  to take the vaccines.
[59:42.480 --> 59:43.480]  That's right.
[59:43.480 --> 59:48.080]  Doctors, nurses, scientists do not trust a so-called vaccine, and you shouldn't either
[59:48.080 --> 59:49.080]  do so.
[59:49.080 --> 59:53.120]  Everyone, you know about the truth.
[59:53.120 --> 1:00:20.680]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:20.680 --> 1:00:28.240]  Mike Monzenyay won the Nobel Prize for discovering the HIV virus, and he's won many other awards.
[1:00:28.240 --> 1:00:30.240]  He's one of the toprologists in the world.
[1:00:30.240 --> 1:00:32.600]  There's a big bombshell interview up at infowars.com.
[1:00:32.600 --> 1:00:35.640]  He just gave to U.S. television.
[1:00:35.640 --> 1:00:43.840]  Nobel Prize winner confirms and reveals that COVID vaccine is creating variants just as
[1:00:43.840 --> 1:00:46.240]  was mainstream news even last year.
[1:00:46.240 --> 1:00:49.480]  Antibody-dependent enhancement, he's also predicting people are going to have horrible
[1:00:49.480 --> 1:00:56.200]  autoimmune responses who have had this to the regular cold viruses that are out there.
[1:00:56.200 --> 1:00:59.040]  Story is on infowars.com.
[1:00:59.040 --> 1:01:04.800]  And here's even February 10th.
[1:01:04.800 --> 1:01:05.800]  Look at this.
[1:01:05.800 --> 1:01:10.600]  COVID-19 vaccines could add fuel to evolution of coronavirus mutations.
[1:01:10.600 --> 1:01:12.760]  Even NPR is reporting that this year.
[1:01:12.760 --> 1:01:18.240]  We were telling you that a year ago because we read the scientific papers.
[1:01:18.240 --> 1:01:24.120]  And he says, by the way, the Nobel Prize winner says that the system knows this.
[1:01:24.120 --> 1:01:28.880]  He says, scientists all know this, that are involved in virality, and they keep silent.
[1:01:28.880 --> 1:01:31.400]  And he says, they're not going to get away with it.
[1:01:31.400 --> 1:01:32.400]  No kidding.
[1:01:32.400 --> 1:01:35.000]  This is crazy what Bill Gates did.
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:37.880]  You know, I try to come in here and be calm, folks, but this is nuts.
[1:01:37.880 --> 1:01:39.200]  I mean, I got Bloomberg right here.
[1:01:39.200 --> 1:01:40.200]  Look at this.
[1:01:40.200 --> 1:01:41.200]  San Force inoculations.
[1:01:41.200 --> 1:01:42.200]  We need to make them compulsory.
[1:01:42.200 --> 1:01:44.520]  Look at this crap.
[1:01:44.520 --> 1:01:45.840]  It's always been the plan.
[1:01:45.840 --> 1:01:49.560]  Now, they want to get the dumb, idiot mobs that took this deadly vaccine, that didn't
[1:01:49.560 --> 1:01:53.120]  even protect them to come after us because they're saying, they're not safe because we
[1:01:53.120 --> 1:01:54.120]  won't take it.
[1:01:54.120 --> 1:01:56.080]  I thought you're safe, dumbasses.
[1:01:56.080 --> 1:01:58.760]  You took the magic Frankenstein.
[1:01:58.760 --> 1:02:01.480]  Let's go to this report and Max Kaiser is coming up on crypto.
[1:02:01.480 --> 1:02:05.240]  Here's the report of me predicting the lockdowns 11 years ago.
[1:02:05.240 --> 1:02:09.320]  The Alex Jones show, there is a war on for your mind.
[1:02:09.320 --> 1:02:13.200]  I mean, I'm not even worthy to be bringing you information that's powerful.
[1:02:13.200 --> 1:02:18.360]  And I hope that you pay attention to what we cover here minute by minute because I've
[1:02:18.360 --> 1:02:22.360]  had chills since last night.
[1:02:22.360 --> 1:02:25.960]  This just confirms everything else we've already researched.
[1:02:25.960 --> 1:02:33.120]  A Rockefeller study envisions future dictatorship controlled by elite, millions being killed,
[1:02:33.120 --> 1:02:37.680]  mandatory quarantines, checkpoints, the end of the family, everything that's in the other
[1:02:37.680 --> 1:02:38.680]  documents.
[1:02:38.680 --> 1:02:42.440]  But this dovetails of all the other Rockefeller Foundation documents about the GMO food to
[1:02:42.440 --> 1:02:46.680]  sterilize you in the forced vaccines and the hell we're already living in this is going
[1:02:46.680 --> 1:02:51.160]  to continue to intensify until we take our governments back from these eugenics madmen.
[1:02:51.160 --> 1:02:53.880]  But that story is up on prisonplanet.com.
[1:02:53.880 --> 1:02:57.400]  The question is, will you have the courage to really do the research yourself?
[1:02:57.400 --> 1:03:01.200]  Because I don't want you to just sit here and hear me make these claims.
[1:03:01.200 --> 1:03:06.040]  These people are so arrogant that they write policy papers, so many of them that they're
[1:03:06.040 --> 1:03:11.960]  producing these policy papers and reports and white papers so fast that you could never
[1:03:11.960 --> 1:03:12.960]  read them all.
[1:03:12.960 --> 1:03:16.280]  It is an open conspiracy against you and your family.
[1:03:16.280 --> 1:03:21.680]  I pray to God, I pray to my heavenly Father Jesus Christ every night to give me the strength
[1:03:21.680 --> 1:03:26.120]  and the will to be able to face this horror and to give me the strength to carry on because
[1:03:26.120 --> 1:03:30.720]  I know why a lot of you don't want to look at this information and just want to comment
[1:03:30.720 --> 1:03:35.200]  on the YouTube videos or on message boards that I'm a liar.
[1:03:35.200 --> 1:03:41.880]  I know why because it's scary.
[1:03:41.880 --> 1:03:46.280]  You're not going to be able to go to the ball games anymore.
[1:03:46.280 --> 1:03:48.600]  You're not going to be able to just go out and get drunk with your friends.
[1:03:48.600 --> 1:03:54.280]  You're not going to be able to just go out and enjoy yourself all the time.
[1:03:54.280 --> 1:04:00.840]  The only chance we've got of beating this scientific dictatorship, this creeping death
[1:04:00.840 --> 1:04:07.240]  that takes its time to incrementally enslave you, mentally, psychologically, physically,
[1:04:07.240 --> 1:04:08.240]  spiritually.
[1:04:08.240 --> 1:04:15.000]  The only way to defeat it is for the rank and file of this planet to realize that you
[1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:19.120]  have a choice to make on what your destiny is going to be.
[1:04:19.120 --> 1:04:23.320]  Once you face this information, once you've consciously admitted it to yourself, it will
[1:04:23.320 --> 1:04:24.560]  take over your life.
[1:04:24.560 --> 1:04:27.080]  It should take over your life.
[1:04:27.080 --> 1:04:31.440]  What else could it do?
[1:04:31.440 --> 1:04:35.680]  We've got to get past the artificial stigma that the controlled corporate media has been
[1:04:35.680 --> 1:04:43.400]  putting out for decades ahead of their opening of unveiling of planetary dictatorship.
[1:04:43.400 --> 1:04:46.880]  They all talk about how we need a police state to carry this out.
[1:04:46.880 --> 1:04:51.840]  Canada and the United States are going to work in lockstep, display the seriousness of our
[1:04:51.840 --> 1:04:52.840]  commitment.
[1:04:52.840 --> 1:05:18.320]  We'll be back when next time, sir.

[1:06:10.600 --> 1:06:15.560]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[1:06:15.560 --> 1:06:24.000]  All right, I had Max Kaiser on, I guess about two and a half months ago, and I said, listen,
[1:06:24.000 --> 1:06:29.760]  I'm going to get behind Bitcoin, and I said, and it's not because I don't think it might
[1:06:29.760 --> 1:06:33.480]  go down in the future that I think it will go back up later.
[1:06:33.480 --> 1:06:38.200]  I'm getting behind it because it's an alternative to these fiat money systems.
[1:06:38.200 --> 1:06:43.920]  It's been around 11, 12 years, and Max Kaiser told me about it 10 years ago and said it's
[1:06:43.920 --> 1:06:47.960]  going to end up being a World Reserve currency, and I didn't get into it 10 years ago, and
[1:06:47.960 --> 1:06:52.120]  he came and visited me two and a half years ago, had dinner with my wife and I, he and
[1:06:52.120 --> 1:06:58.040]  his partner Stacy, Herbert, and he said, listen, it's going to double or triple in the next
[1:06:58.040 --> 1:06:59.040]  couple of years.
[1:06:59.040 --> 1:07:00.040]  He did exactly what he said.
[1:07:00.040 --> 1:07:03.880]  Now, you see Elon Musk come out and say he's behind it, and he says, well, it takes too
[1:07:03.880 --> 1:07:09.520]  much electricity for a carbon tax, and then it goes down, but then now Elon Musk says
[1:07:09.520 --> 1:07:13.960]  he supports crypto and battles against fiat money.
[1:07:13.960 --> 1:07:21.760]  What I see happening is speculators driving it down so they can buy more of it.
[1:07:21.760 --> 1:07:25.120]  But I'm not a speculator, and I'm not telling you to go out and get this.
[1:07:25.120 --> 1:07:31.480]  I'm saying that these systems are here, they're all speculative, there's a lot of fly-by-night
[1:07:31.480 --> 1:07:37.560]  stuff, but out of the whole pack, Bitcoin's the best, in my opinion, and so I started to
[1:07:37.560 --> 1:07:38.560]  accrue some.
[1:07:38.560 --> 1:07:42.560]  Now, not a lot, but I've got some, because it's something that in the future I can go
[1:07:42.560 --> 1:07:44.920]  across borders with, it's an alternative.
[1:07:44.920 --> 1:07:49.440]  The Chinese are buying it all up feverishly, then coming out and bad-mouthing it, clearly
[1:07:49.440 --> 1:07:51.880]  to buy it up.
[1:07:51.880 --> 1:07:55.400]  Our central banks say, oh, we're going to start moving into Bitcoin, then they say we're
[1:07:55.400 --> 1:07:57.440]  going to ban it so they can buy it up.
[1:07:57.440 --> 1:08:04.080]  I think that's a no-brainer here, but again, I've been tepid, I've been timid, I've waited
[1:08:04.080 --> 1:08:09.400]  10 years, when Max Kaiser had to give me $10,000 Bitcoin, I couldn't figure out how to make
[1:08:09.400 --> 1:08:17.400]  a wallet, put a digital wallet on my Apple laptop, and so that's a big crane I missed.
[1:08:17.400 --> 1:08:20.400]  And so again, I would not invest in this money, you can't lose.
[1:08:20.400 --> 1:08:23.880]  But the dollars being devalued, other currencies are being devalued.
[1:08:23.880 --> 1:08:29.640]  My God, Biden wants to spend $4 plus trillion, so Max Kaiser joins us, the original Bitcoin
[1:08:29.640 --> 1:08:33.760]  guru, to give us his take on what's happening and on what's unfolding.
[1:08:33.760 --> 1:08:38.160]  I just know Paul Krugman has said Bitcoin will never be a success for 10 years.
[1:08:38.160 --> 1:08:43.360]  He also said that the internet would be no big deal like the fax machine.
[1:08:43.360 --> 1:08:46.360]  And so I'm not going to listen to the guy that's always wrong, I'm going to listen to
[1:08:46.360 --> 1:08:48.880]  the guy that's so far has been right.
[1:08:48.880 --> 1:08:52.160]  You've heard what I said, is that accurate or what's really going on here, Max?
[1:08:52.160 --> 1:08:55.280]  Right, you know you buy your enemies.
[1:08:55.280 --> 1:08:59.800]  And the fact that Paul Krugman is an enemy of this should tell you that we're on the
[1:08:59.800 --> 1:09:01.840]  right side of history here.
[1:09:01.840 --> 1:09:07.440]  The same thing with a lot of other folks, big names who have been hating on Bitcoin
[1:09:07.440 --> 1:09:12.200]  for 10 years, because it does separate the state from money, and that's the first time
[1:09:12.200 --> 1:09:13.200]  that's ever happened.
[1:09:13.200 --> 1:09:17.600]  We've saw something like that in the Middle Ages, the separation of church and state,
[1:09:17.600 --> 1:09:23.040]  when the Gutenberg press came around and it put knowledge into everybody's hands.
[1:09:23.040 --> 1:09:26.400]  And we had an enormous separation in the beginning of the Renaissance.
[1:09:26.400 --> 1:09:32.520]  Now we've got a separation of state and money with this technology called Bitcoin, and it's
[1:09:32.520 --> 1:09:36.600]  totally upending that Apple Card is changing everything around the world, is changing what
[1:09:36.600 --> 1:09:41.840]  the definition of money is, and people are freaking out, understandably.
[1:09:41.840 --> 1:09:46.640]  The amount of energy that Bitcoin uses, you know, it's funny because it's so ludicrous.
[1:09:46.640 --> 1:09:55.800]  There's about 160,000 terawatt hours of energy used on planet Earth a year, and right now
[1:09:55.800 --> 1:10:00.960]  Bitcoin uses one-tenth of one percent of that energy.
[1:10:00.960 --> 1:10:06.040]  But Max, that's all the global, I agree, the carbon tax is so the UN and the corporations
[1:10:06.040 --> 1:10:08.520]  can say what energy is bad, what energy is good.
[1:10:08.520 --> 1:10:12.480]  If they can tell you where you can use energy, they control all life on the planet.
[1:10:12.480 --> 1:10:13.480]  That's all that is.
[1:10:13.480 --> 1:10:14.480]  It's pure bull.
[1:10:14.480 --> 1:10:16.200]  Yeah, that's nonsense.
[1:10:16.200 --> 1:10:25.120]  Of that 160,000 terawatt hours of energy, 60 percent of it is completely wasted.
[1:10:25.120 --> 1:10:30.080]  So this is energy, you know, energy has very difficult times moving from place to place.
[1:10:30.080 --> 1:10:33.280]  It gets wasted in transport, etc.
[1:10:33.280 --> 1:10:38.640]  All the natural gas that flares during oil drilling is completely wasted.
[1:10:38.640 --> 1:10:42.080]  Actually Bitcoin can go and capture that stranded gas.
[1:10:42.080 --> 1:10:44.880]  It's actually a green energy, a green technology.
[1:10:44.880 --> 1:10:46.400]  It captures stranded energy.
[1:10:46.400 --> 1:10:50.560]  It can convert hydro and solar into Bitcoin.
[1:10:50.560 --> 1:10:55.360]  So it's completely nonsense that they are critical of their point of energy.
[1:10:55.360 --> 1:10:56.360]  Let's talk about the moves right now we see happen.
[1:10:56.360 --> 1:11:01.040]  We see the central banks and governments and universities and state governments, you name
[1:11:01.040 --> 1:11:04.440]  it, city governments move into Bitcoin heavily.
[1:11:04.440 --> 1:11:05.440]  It goes to all time high.
[1:11:05.440 --> 1:11:10.680]  If you look at the last two big dips in its history, it's a similar graph.
[1:11:10.680 --> 1:11:15.600]  What do you think is going to happen in the near future and what precipitated this historic
[1:11:15.600 --> 1:11:17.040]  plunge in Bitcoin?
[1:11:17.040 --> 1:11:18.040]  Right.
[1:11:18.040 --> 1:11:20.920]  Well, as you point out, we've been in it for 11 years now.
[1:11:20.920 --> 1:11:23.120]  We started buying it at $1.
[1:11:23.120 --> 1:11:28.920]  We've been through 15 of these kinds of corrections over the past 11 years.
[1:11:28.920 --> 1:11:31.280]  This one is, I think, the seventh biggest.
[1:11:31.280 --> 1:11:34.080]  It's a garden variety correction.
[1:11:34.080 --> 1:11:38.360]  And you have to look at it more as problems in the fiat money world rather than in the
[1:11:38.360 --> 1:11:39.360]  Bitcoin world.
[1:11:39.360 --> 1:11:42.800]  Because in the Bitcoin world, some things never change.
[1:11:42.800 --> 1:11:50.080]  There's coins issued every 10 minutes, the blocks are added every 10 minutes, it has
[1:11:50.080 --> 1:11:53.960]  been for 11 years with that interruption, the technology's never gone down, and other
[1:11:53.960 --> 1:11:56.600]  aspects of the protocol are perfectly intact.
[1:11:56.600 --> 1:12:00.760]  The price itself fluctuates, but I'm willing to take a little fluctuation, a little volatility
[1:12:00.760 --> 1:12:06.400]  in exchange for unconfiscatable, immutable, censorship resistant outside of any state
[1:12:06.400 --> 1:12:07.400]  control money.
[1:12:07.400 --> 1:12:08.400]  Sure.
[1:12:08.400 --> 1:12:10.320]  So what drove it down and what is your next prediction?
[1:12:10.320 --> 1:12:15.040]  You told me 10 years ago it would probably replace the dollars of the world currency.
[1:12:15.040 --> 1:12:17.600]  You told me it would be worth hundreds of billions of dollars it was.
[1:12:17.600 --> 1:12:21.000]  But you told me two and a half years ago it was going to triple in value it did.
[1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:22.520]  So tell me what's coming next.
[1:12:22.520 --> 1:12:23.520]  Right.
[1:12:23.520 --> 1:12:28.760]  So at the last week, you had China, where they decided that they're going to not allow
[1:12:28.760 --> 1:12:33.920]  for coal mining to mine Bitcoin, and there's a lot of mining in China.
[1:12:33.920 --> 1:12:37.680]  And so all that mining is going to move, or hash rate as it's called, is going to move
[1:12:37.680 --> 1:12:41.040]  out of China into places like the United States, where the energy is very cheap.
[1:12:41.040 --> 1:12:42.920]  It's actually quite bullish for Bitcoin.
[1:12:42.920 --> 1:12:47.400]  So you had some sellers come in, there's a lot of leverage in the market, price came
[1:12:47.400 --> 1:12:49.520]  down the way it has.
[1:12:49.520 --> 1:12:54.520]  But if you look at all those other projects out there like Doge, Elon Muskcoin, it got
[1:12:54.520 --> 1:12:56.040]  absolutely decimated.
[1:12:56.040 --> 1:13:00.800]  Or Bitcoin Cash, or Bitcoins of Toasty Vision, or XRP, all those coins got completely obliterated.
[1:13:00.800 --> 1:13:01.800]  Sure.
[1:13:01.800 --> 1:13:03.120]  As you predicted, they all fared worse.
[1:13:03.120 --> 1:13:07.560]  Why is Elon messing around with this Dogecoin then?
[1:13:07.560 --> 1:13:14.560]  He's an egomaniac, and he saw that Michael Saylor over at MicroStrategy got the spotlight
[1:13:14.560 --> 1:13:17.680]  shined on him when he bought a lot of Bitcoin.
[1:13:17.680 --> 1:13:22.400]  And so Elon went, the mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the fairest CEO of all?
[1:13:22.400 --> 1:13:25.720]  And the mirror said, it's Michael Saylor at MicroStrategy.
[1:13:25.720 --> 1:13:31.280]  And the wick at which Elon like, oh no, I'm no longer the hot topic du jour.
[1:13:31.280 --> 1:13:37.960]  So he started messing around with an altcoin called Doge, and it ran up in price, and now
[1:13:37.960 --> 1:13:43.360]  it's utterly collapsed because there's no reason for it to exist other than as an ego
[1:13:43.360 --> 1:13:46.280]  gratification for Elon Musk.
[1:13:46.280 --> 1:13:50.800]  And he's probably just going to dump it and it'll go down another 90%.
[1:13:50.800 --> 1:13:52.360]  And he'll end up in Bitcoin.
[1:13:52.360 --> 1:13:55.760]  So he's learning about Bitcoin slowly, very publicly.
[1:13:55.760 --> 1:13:57.760]  He's making a lot of mistakes that people make.
[1:13:57.760 --> 1:13:58.760]  I've made mistakes.
[1:13:58.760 --> 1:13:59.760]  You've made mistakes.
[1:13:59.760 --> 1:14:03.440]  Elon Musk is making the same mistakes very publicly with a lot of money, but he makes
[1:14:03.440 --> 1:14:04.440]  the exact same mistakes.
[1:14:04.440 --> 1:14:08.360]  I always say that you don't change Bitcoin, Bitcoin changes you.
[1:14:08.360 --> 1:14:13.000]  So he came to Bitcoin as a narcissist and an egomaniac thinking, oh, I'm going to fix
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:14.000]  this thing.
[1:14:14.000 --> 1:14:15.560]  But now it's fixing him.
[1:14:15.560 --> 1:14:18.880]  He's the one that was the problem, not Bitcoin.
[1:14:18.880 --> 1:14:21.320]  Let's expand on that.
[1:14:21.320 --> 1:14:26.680]  Are you using this big dip, this historic dip, to buy?
[1:14:26.680 --> 1:14:28.640]  I always buy all the time.
[1:14:28.640 --> 1:14:30.680]  I buy dollar cost averaging.
[1:14:30.680 --> 1:14:38.120]  I'm always buying, as you know, my cost basis for my stack, my whole stack, is in the hundreds
[1:14:38.120 --> 1:14:39.120]  of dollars.
[1:14:39.120 --> 1:14:42.080]  It's way, way, way lower than we are today.
[1:14:42.080 --> 1:14:48.600]  But as a good pleb in this space, I have solidarity with my Bitcoin people and we're out there
[1:14:48.600 --> 1:14:56.280]  buying on swanbitcoin.com forward slash Alex, that's where we go and we can do dollar cost
[1:14:56.280 --> 1:14:57.280]  averaging.
[1:14:57.280 --> 1:14:59.000]  It's a good, clean place to do it.
[1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:03.120]  If people can do, explain how you put in what you want, but if you want to set it up, it's
[1:15:03.120 --> 1:15:06.520]  just weekly or monthly or whatever, whatever you want, pulls it out so you don't forget
[1:15:06.520 --> 1:15:07.520]  about it.
[1:15:07.520 --> 1:15:08.520]  Right.
[1:15:08.520 --> 1:15:12.480]  So on days like today, when the price is down sharply, the system automatically buys you
[1:15:12.480 --> 1:15:14.240]  a Bitcoin at the dollar cost average.
[1:15:14.240 --> 1:15:19.040]  So if you say set it up where you want to get $10 a week or $100 a week, it just automatically
[1:15:19.040 --> 1:15:21.840]  buys the coins at whatever price it is.
[1:15:21.840 --> 1:15:25.720]  And on days when it's cheap, you're going to get more Bitcoin for your dollar, unchanged
[1:15:25.720 --> 1:15:26.720]  on days when it's up.
[1:15:26.720 --> 1:15:28.440]  You're going to get less Bitcoin for your dollar.
[1:15:28.440 --> 1:15:33.080]  Over time, you end up with a nice average price and it takes all the emotions out of
[1:15:33.080 --> 1:15:34.080]  it.
[1:15:34.080 --> 1:15:38.600]  It's easy to set up swanbitcoin.com forward slash Alex and you know, you can just set
[1:15:38.600 --> 1:15:41.800]  it and forget it and you just accumulate Bitcoin over time.
[1:15:41.800 --> 1:15:45.400]  Let's come back and talk about the other fiat money systems and where they're going and
[1:15:45.400 --> 1:15:49.680]  inflation and so much more in the latest and where he thinks Bitcoin is going in the future.
[1:15:49.680 --> 1:15:51.200]  How long will this drop continue?
[1:15:51.200 --> 1:15:57.960]  We'll be right back with Max Kaiser stay with us.
[1:15:57.960 --> 1:16:03.320]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021 and I just want to say something.
[1:16:03.320 --> 1:16:07.680]  I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together over
[1:16:07.680 --> 1:16:08.680]  the years.
[1:16:08.680 --> 1:16:12.600]  It is truly an answer to prayer and I am so blessed and thankful for all of you, the listeners
[1:16:12.600 --> 1:16:13.600]  of this show.
[1:16:13.600 --> 1:16:17.520]  I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you, whether you are old, whether you are
[1:16:17.520 --> 1:16:21.360]  Hispanic, white, black, it doesn't matter, you got red blood and if you love freedom
[1:16:21.360 --> 1:16:26.880]  and justice and if you love our innocent children, we are brothers and sisters together and it
[1:16:26.880 --> 1:16:31.560]  has just been an incredible experience to work with you over the years and it's crazier
[1:16:31.560 --> 1:16:32.560]  things are.
[1:16:32.560 --> 1:16:37.840]  I want to keep working under the future but again that's really up to you and up to God.
[1:16:37.840 --> 1:16:42.520]  So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support us
[1:16:42.520 --> 1:16:45.240]  but again that's up to you and your relationship with God.
[1:16:45.240 --> 1:16:48.840]  I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've
[1:16:48.840 --> 1:16:54.360]  done and just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you and hopefully
[1:16:54.360 --> 1:16:56.760]  God will touch your heart to continue to support InfoWars.
[1:16:56.760 --> 1:16:57.760]  God bless.
[1:16:57.760 --> 1:17:01.680]  When listeners call to the show and thank me for all I've done, I always stop them and
[1:17:01.680 --> 1:17:04.720]  I say thank you for what you've done.
[1:17:04.720 --> 1:17:06.640]  Thank you for keeping InfoWars on the air.
[1:17:06.640 --> 1:17:10.240]  Thank you for praying for us and thank you for spreading the word.

[1:17:25.080 --> 1:17:26.720]  you go and what you do.
[1:17:26.720 --> 1:17:30.480]  Not because you've done something wrong but because the big telecoms, big tech and the
[1:17:30.480 --> 1:17:34.240]  globalist are predatory and are evil and in the surveillance state we need to more and
[1:17:34.240 --> 1:17:38.800]  more start doing everything we can to mitigate the criminal activity they're involved in.

[1:18:59.320 --> 1:19:05.320]  Bioremediation is a process used to treat contaminating water, soil and subsurface material by accelerating
[1:19:05.320 --> 1:19:09.800]  naturally occurring environmental conditions to stimulate growth of microorganisms and degrade
[1:19:09.800 --> 1:19:10.800]  targeted pollutants.
[1:19:10.800 --> 1:19:16.120]  For the first time, the BioPros are bringing to the public market a suite of bioremediation
[1:19:16.120 --> 1:19:18.160]  products to the everyday consumer.
[1:19:18.160 --> 1:19:22.840]  Their first product they are launching is called BioSeptic Pro, a product specifically
[1:19:22.840 --> 1:19:25.840]  designed to establish a healthy septic system.
[1:19:25.840 --> 1:19:30.200]  BioSeptic Pro contains live microorganisms, not traditional enzymes like its competitors.

[1:19:58.160 --> 1:20:10.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:20:10.040 --> 1:20:19.440]  Alright folks, Alex Jones here on this live Sunday transmission coming up from 6 to 8.
[1:20:19.440 --> 1:20:25.080]  Owen Schreuer and Sunday Live and we cut out all the network ads, there's only local ads
[1:20:25.080 --> 1:20:27.840]  for radio and TV stations, six minutes an hour.
[1:20:27.840 --> 1:20:32.560]  A lot of stations picking it up and Owen has a lot of guests, a lot of callers, a lot of
[1:20:32.560 --> 1:20:35.200]  news that we don't get to that he covers.
[1:20:35.200 --> 1:20:36.640]  That is a 6 to 8 p.m.
[1:20:36.640 --> 1:20:41.800]  He joins me every Sunday like I do and he comes in of course 3 to 6 p.m. with the war room
[1:20:41.800 --> 1:20:47.160]  and of course there is 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. before I go on live, all time central Harrison Smith
[1:20:47.160 --> 1:20:53.760]  and American Journal and remember, the globalists want this all censored, only way it gets out
[1:20:53.760 --> 1:20:54.760]  is you spread the word.
[1:20:54.760 --> 1:20:57.520]  So let's look at the zero hedge article, it's excellent.
[1:20:57.520 --> 1:21:02.840]  In human history no single asset has come under such coordinated assault by globalist
[1:21:02.840 --> 1:21:08.200]  institutions and that's by Eric Peters, CIO of One River Asset Management, I'm going to
[1:21:08.200 --> 1:21:13.000]  read just three quotes and then go back to Max Kaiser but I waited to get into it until
[1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:15.560]  I saw it accepted globally.
[1:21:15.560 --> 1:21:21.400]  We know it has more value than the fiat currencies but Paul Krugman and people like Pope Francis
[1:21:21.400 --> 1:21:26.800]  are the worst type of globalist on earth so if they are against something I should be
[1:21:26.800 --> 1:21:27.800]  for it.
[1:21:27.800 --> 1:21:29.200]  Here's Krugman.
[1:21:29.200 --> 1:21:37.120]  The growth of the internet will be slow drastically and the flaw in McCaffey's law becomes apparent.
[1:21:37.120 --> 1:21:39.920]  Most people have nothing to say to each other.
[1:21:39.920 --> 1:21:45.400]  By 2005 it will become clear that the internet impacting the economy has been no greater
[1:21:45.400 --> 1:21:48.120]  than that of the fax machine.
[1:21:48.120 --> 1:21:55.680]  That is, talk about a foot in your mouth story, that is him in the New York Times in 1998.
[1:21:55.680 --> 1:22:02.400]  Here he is in 2013, Bitcoin isn't a new invention, it's been around since 2009 and in all that
[1:22:02.400 --> 1:22:06.600]  time nobody seems to have found any good legal use for it.
[1:22:06.600 --> 1:22:11.880]  It's not a convenient medium of exchange, it's not a stable store of value, it's definitely
[1:22:11.880 --> 1:22:17.280]  not a unit of account, Paul Krugman tweeting to 4.6 million people that follow him off a
[1:22:17.280 --> 1:22:18.280]  cliff on Twitter.
[1:22:18.280 --> 1:22:22.640]  Here's another one by Pope Francis, I'm going to stop here, technology based on the use
[1:22:22.640 --> 1:22:27.800]  of highly polluting fossil fuels needs to be replaced without delay so anything that
[1:22:27.800 --> 1:22:31.320]  gets electricity is now evil because that's what he's saying, period, it's just getting
[1:22:31.320 --> 1:22:33.000]  all sorts of electricity.
[1:22:33.000 --> 1:22:37.240]  There is reason to hope that humanity at the dawn of the 34th century will be remembered
[1:22:37.240 --> 1:22:45.600]  for having generously shouldered its grave responsibilities, for having generously shouldered
[1:22:45.600 --> 1:22:47.400]  its grave responsibilities, that's right.
[1:22:47.400 --> 1:22:52.120]  He's telling you you can't have a new financial system, you can't have a digital mode of currency
[1:22:52.120 --> 1:22:56.320]  or of exchange because you'll basically go to hell and kill the earth.
[1:22:56.320 --> 1:23:01.120]  That's the new Catholic church is, you're an evil human not because you sinned but because
[1:23:01.120 --> 1:23:04.080]  you are a carbon based life form period for existing.
[1:23:04.080 --> 1:23:08.480]  Max Kaiser, I'm ranting, thanks for joining us, what in the hell is going on here?
[1:23:08.480 --> 1:23:13.880]  Well, in the case of Paul Krugman, he is what's called a Keynesian, he believes in money printing
[1:23:13.880 --> 1:23:18.880]  to solve every problem, he doesn't like gold either, and he's been wrong about Bitcoin,
[1:23:18.880 --> 1:23:24.000]  he's been wrong about technology, and shockingly, you know the Paul Krugman story, three days
[1:23:24.000 --> 1:23:27.960]  after 9-11, he wrote a piece in the New York Times saying why this would be great for the
[1:23:27.960 --> 1:23:33.600]  economy, which I thought was shocking and disgusting, but nevertheless he still kept
[1:23:33.600 --> 1:23:35.640]  his job over at the New York Times.
[1:23:35.640 --> 1:23:40.160]  I'm just looking at the Bitcoin market right now, somebody just bought $33,000 or $1.2
[1:23:40.160 --> 1:23:44.280]  billion, and it's heading back up, it's going to hit new all time highs, Alex, in the next
[1:23:44.280 --> 1:23:45.280]  couple of weeks.
[1:23:45.280 --> 1:23:48.480]  It's going to be over $65,000 in the next couple of weeks.
[1:23:48.480 --> 1:23:54.680]  My target for 2021 is $220,000 per coin, I'm still got that target, there's no reason
[1:23:54.680 --> 1:23:56.600]  why I shouldn't hit that target.
[1:23:56.600 --> 1:24:00.960]  All the short term noise and fluctuations are meaningless, all of these globalists as
[1:24:00.960 --> 1:24:06.560]  we say are panicking, they're trying to stop something that they cannot stop, it's unstoppable,
[1:24:06.560 --> 1:24:10.720]  there's nothing that any country or group of countries can do to stop Bitcoin from
[1:24:10.720 --> 1:24:16.920]  continuing to generate blocks every 10 minutes, and to suck all the fiat money in the world
[1:24:16.920 --> 1:24:23.000]  into Bitcoin, and now they're simply panicking, and they're coming out with these horrible
[1:24:23.000 --> 1:24:29.320]  narratives that make no sense, Paul Krugman, if you break down the arguments with the Pope
[1:24:29.320 --> 1:24:33.520]  and the Krugman and all these people, fact by fact, line by line, they just don't end
[1:24:33.520 --> 1:24:37.720]  up, they make absolutely no sense, but the great thing is that people can opt out of
[1:24:37.720 --> 1:24:41.440]  the system by owning Bitcoin, because you're separating yourself from the system, we can
[1:24:41.440 --> 1:24:46.640]  transact and nobody can stop us, no state can stop us, and the transaction is final
[1:24:46.640 --> 1:24:51.720]  because the transaction verifies itself, it's self-verifying, and it is the greatest store
[1:24:51.720 --> 1:24:56.640]  of value ever in history, and you can simply store it in a way that nobody can access it,
[1:24:56.640 --> 1:25:01.960]  it's unconfiscatable, and I tell you, there's a national security issue involved here, because
[1:25:01.960 --> 1:25:10.120]  I'm looking around the world and I see countries like Iran now is 4.5% of the Bitcoin mining
[1:25:10.120 --> 1:25:17.200]  is in Iran, so America is a strategic, you know, is a national security issue, if they
[1:25:17.200 --> 1:25:23.440]  don't start mining Bitcoin soon, they're going to watch the Iranian Bitcoin stash become
[1:25:23.440 --> 1:25:27.720]  the hardest money in the world, and they're going to have the ability to dictate what's
[1:25:27.720 --> 1:25:32.240]  going on all over the world in a way that America can no longer do so, because America
[1:25:32.240 --> 1:25:37.760]  only has the fiat money, you see what's happening geopolitically, Alex, the Nord Stream 2, which
[1:25:37.760 --> 1:25:43.120]  is the pipeline from Russia to Germany, that was going to be sanctioned, everyone hated
[1:25:43.120 --> 1:25:47.560]  it, we got to stop it, and then Joe Biden said, actually, you know what, let it go,
[1:25:47.560 --> 1:25:50.840]  because we can't stop it, because we have to let Germany get their energy, and I've
[1:25:50.840 --> 1:25:54.720]  been saying that for years, of course, we're going to let Germany get their energy, Germany's
[1:25:54.720 --> 1:25:59.080]  not going to not get their energy from Russia, because it's 10 times cheaper than trying
[1:25:59.080 --> 1:26:04.760]  to get it from the United States, and what you say is so important, China, for now is
[1:26:04.760 --> 1:26:07.840]  attacking Bitcoin, I know they're heavily invested in it, because they're about to launch
[1:26:07.840 --> 1:26:12.480]  their Huawei based, so called cryptocurrency, which they admit they can turn off at any
[1:26:12.480 --> 1:26:16.760]  time, if they don't like you, and they said they're going to put an expiration date on
[1:26:16.760 --> 1:26:22.880]  it, where it goes bad, so they're telling you, it's a communist Chinese, crony, fascist
[1:26:22.880 --> 1:26:28.320]  demon model, and so out of all these coins, we want Bitcoin to be preeminent, because
[1:26:28.320 --> 1:26:34.080]  it's more a libertarian, and it's the original OG, and all these globalist dirtbags like
[1:26:34.080 --> 1:26:36.080]  Paul Krebman, and the Pope, and G.G.
[1:26:36.080 --> 1:26:40.760]  Ping, don't like it, my God, this is a war, I mean, this is a fight, because the Federal
[1:26:40.760 --> 1:26:44.280]  Reserve is getting ready to come out with its own stupid so-called cryptocurrency, no,
[1:26:44.280 --> 1:26:49.200]  I want this one to win, because it's the OG, and because it is the freest one.
[1:26:49.200 --> 1:26:56.600]  Exactly, that's exactly right, and the technology was launched in 2009, after 20 years of the
[1:26:56.600 --> 1:27:03.080]  cypher punks trying to create digital, decentralized scarcity on the internet, as you know, back
[1:27:03.080 --> 1:27:08.840]  in 1996, I invented a digital currency, I have a patent on it, 590176, you can look
[1:27:08.840 --> 1:27:15.720]  it up, I know this industry extremely well, and when I saw the source code for Bitcoin
[1:27:15.720 --> 1:27:21.760]  in 2011, I realized this is the game changer that's going to completely alter money and
[1:27:21.760 --> 1:27:26.760]  how people trade and store money in the world, and it's going to have a profound impact,
[1:27:26.760 --> 1:27:31.880]  and now 11 years later, without the ability to stop it, and they've tried many, many times
[1:27:31.880 --> 1:27:36.480]  to stop it, but they can't stop it, now they're just pulling out all the stops, and they've
[1:27:36.480 --> 1:27:40.120]  got Elon Musk, I think, is more of a state actor, more than anything else, because his
[1:27:40.120 --> 1:27:45.160]  entire fortune is based on carbon credits, he lies on government carbon credits.
[1:27:45.160 --> 1:27:49.520]  Sure, he's come out instead, he's come out and said we need carbon taxes two weeks ago,
[1:27:49.520 --> 1:27:54.080]  and so clearly he's saying that, because he wants these electric cars.
[1:27:54.080 --> 1:28:01.000]  Yeah, without carbon credits, he would be worth nothing, and so he got into Bitcoin,
[1:28:01.000 --> 1:28:04.680]  and it started to work on his mind a little bit, and hopefully it'll educate him to the
[1:28:04.680 --> 1:28:08.600]  point where he fully embraces it and understands that it's the game changer that it is.
[1:28:08.600 --> 1:28:14.800]  You don't think he got into Bitcoin so he can become, quote, the spokesman to wreck it?
[1:28:14.800 --> 1:28:20.200]  Because he's so closely associated with the state, I think that, and that Saturday Night
[1:28:20.200 --> 1:28:26.080]  Live NBC show, which is owned by Comcast, is also a state apparatus for propaganda, to
[1:28:26.080 --> 1:28:27.200]  be quite frank.
[1:28:27.200 --> 1:28:33.000]  I think he's playing, he's torn between just being a state puppet, relying on carbon
[1:28:33.000 --> 1:28:36.000]  credits, and being an entrepreneur.
[1:28:36.000 --> 1:28:40.600]  Certainly if you've got, I think he's got 200 or 300 billion dollars of net worth, you
[1:28:40.600 --> 1:28:46.280]  get the attention of very powerful people who try to manipulate you, and he said publicly
[1:28:46.280 --> 1:28:49.440]  he's got Asperger, Syndrome, et cetera, so he's on the spectrum for-
[1:28:49.440 --> 1:28:51.840]  Hey, hey, you do have five more minutes for me, because I've got a few more questions
[1:28:51.840 --> 1:28:53.160]  about the future of Bitcoin.
[1:28:53.160 --> 1:28:57.960]  Stay there, Max Codd is our guest, Sunday Night.
[1:28:57.960 --> 1:29:06.440]  Your brain, your heart, your bones, your liver, your eyes, everything has a better shot at

[1:29:09.640 --> 1:29:10.760]  the best out there.

[1:29:16.160 --> 1:29:19.200]  Everybody already knows what high-quality fish oil does, and it costs us even more to
[1:29:19.200 --> 1:29:23.240]  put it through a process to remove any trace mercury that's in it, so this is also clean
[1:29:23.240 --> 1:29:24.240]  fish oil.
[1:29:24.240 --> 1:29:27.160]  It's been sold out for months, but it's back in stock 50% off.
[1:29:27.160 --> 1:29:30.280]  Still oil is set to sell out, and it's amazing as well.
[1:29:30.280 --> 1:29:36.280]  It's at 25% off, but when you get them both together in a combo, it's 50% off as well.
[1:29:36.280 --> 1:29:40.960]  Ultimate Fish Oil, now back in stock at infowarstore.com, and when I forget to take it, I really

[1:29:45.040 --> 1:29:46.040]  amazing.
[1:29:46.040 --> 1:29:47.040]  Blizzard thought I was joking.
[1:29:47.040 --> 1:29:49.040]  You've tried it out, and most of you have been blown away.

[1:29:59.280 --> 1:30:03.200]  One of the most common questions I get on air, but also off air when I'm just out and
[1:30:03.200 --> 1:30:08.280]  about, is, Alex, what do I say to my family about the vaccines?
[1:30:08.280 --> 1:30:09.600]  How do I warn them?
[1:30:09.600 --> 1:30:13.480]  Well, the problem is there's so many problems with it, so many facts.
[1:30:13.480 --> 1:30:17.040]  It's the history of contaminated vaccines, the fact that they have liability protection
[1:30:17.040 --> 1:30:21.800]  in the U.S. and Europe, the fact that they've been caught adding sterilants and cancer
[1:30:21.800 --> 1:30:26.400]  viruses and other things to vaccines, and the whole history of secret experimentation
[1:30:26.400 --> 1:30:30.160]  on at-risk groups of poor blacks, poor whites, Native Americans.
[1:30:30.160 --> 1:30:34.720]  The list goes on and on, but what about the fact that Fauci testified to Congress, and
[1:30:34.720 --> 1:30:43.520]  so did the head of the CDC in late May of 2021, that around half of the NIH CDC staff,
[1:30:43.520 --> 1:30:46.520]  medical doctors, neurologist, scientists have refused to take the vaccine, and don't
[1:30:46.520 --> 1:30:47.520]  think it's safe?
[1:30:47.520 --> 1:30:51.320]  Yeah, I think what half of the doctors are scared to take it, and it's the same thing
[1:30:51.320 --> 1:30:54.200]  in the private practices out there, similar numbers, that that's not something I'm going
[1:30:54.200 --> 1:30:55.200]  to be taking.
[1:30:55.200 --> 1:30:56.200]  That's very, very simple.
[1:30:56.200 --> 1:30:57.200]  There's your answer.
[1:30:57.200 --> 1:31:04.440]  One of the most popular memes on the Internet in the last decade has been, Alex Jones was
[1:31:04.440 --> 1:31:10.920]  right, but it now routinely trends number one on platforms like Twitter and Facebook,
[1:31:10.920 --> 1:31:13.560]  making the globalists pull their hair out in anger.
[1:31:13.560 --> 1:31:17.160]  Well, let me tell you, we are tomorrow's news today, and thanks for your support.
[1:31:17.160 --> 1:31:21.480]  We're still on air at infowarners.com and band.video, radio stations and TV stations
[1:31:21.480 --> 1:31:22.480]  across the country.
[1:31:22.480 --> 1:31:26.440]  And our film Endgame, censored and taken offline by Amazon when it hit number one a few years
[1:31:26.440 --> 1:31:28.440]  ago, is now available again.
[1:31:28.440 --> 1:31:32.800]  We have repredated it on high quality DVD, in HD, it has a zero country code, eating
[1:31:32.800 --> 1:31:36.360]  anyone in the world is authorized to make copies of it, and I'm asking you to get the
[1:31:36.360 --> 1:31:39.840]  original, make copies, give it to everyone you know, air it on local access TV, give
[1:31:39.840 --> 1:31:43.400]  it to your pastors, your police chiefs, your state reps, your prime ministers, whatever
[1:31:43.400 --> 1:31:48.320]  you do, warn the world, this film uses their own documents and statements, 14 years ago
[1:31:48.320 --> 1:31:49.320]  to expose them.
[1:31:49.320 --> 1:31:53.680]  It's more important than ever, available at infowarners.com, that's infowarners.com,
[1:31:53.680 --> 1:31:58.440]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[1:31:58.440 --> 1:32:03.200]  Listen up, patriots, I'm running a sale that's the biggest I've ever run on three products
[1:32:03.200 --> 1:32:04.600]  that are already selling out.
[1:32:04.600 --> 1:32:09.120]  Well, then why am I selling it then at 50% off or 60% off depending on which sale you
[1:32:09.120 --> 1:32:12.720]  go with, because I know a lot of you are on the fence, you haven't tried it and I know
[1:32:12.720 --> 1:32:14.360]  you're going to get hooked once you do.
[1:32:14.360 --> 1:32:20.960]  So for one week only, we're running 50% off on ultimate fish oil, 50% off on winter
[1:32:20.960 --> 1:32:25.640]  sun with D3 and K-4 immune system, and oh my gosh, people love this so much, we've sold
[1:32:25.640 --> 1:32:31.480]  out for months back in a limited supply, turbo force 10 hour, clean energy, it's 40% off.
[1:32:31.480 --> 1:32:37.480]  But you can get them all three together in the optimum trifecta pack for 60% off, we've
[1:32:37.480 --> 1:32:41.800]  never offered that on these products, it's basically a lost leader, I want you to get
[1:32:41.800 --> 1:32:43.880]  them, I want you to try them, I want you to love them.
[1:32:43.880 --> 1:32:48.680]  So believe me, you're going to be a blown away, go to infowarstore.com, we're running
[1:32:48.680 --> 1:32:53.680]  this Monday through Sunday and the deal is over, best deal ever, take advantage of it
[1:32:53.680 --> 1:33:01.760]  at infowarstore.com and fund the Info War.
[1:33:01.760 --> 1:33:18.240]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show, news, analysis, reports, it's the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:18.240 --> 1:33:26.360]  All right, it was about two and a half years ago Max Kaiser came to visit me, I said, listen,
[1:33:26.360 --> 1:33:29.640]  you didn't get into Bitcoin, I was trying to give it to you eight years ago, not ten
[1:33:29.640 --> 1:33:33.520]  years ago, you should get into it now, it's going to triple in the next few years, my
[1:33:33.520 --> 1:33:36.720]  wife's like, yeah, he's a smart guy, you've got to do it and I said, yeah, I'm going to
[1:33:36.720 --> 1:33:41.840]  do it and then I had him on air and he predicted what was coming and it basically was exactly
[1:33:41.840 --> 1:33:47.360]  what he said and then Peter Schiff, love him to death, he's a great guy, got so mad, it
[1:33:47.360 --> 1:33:51.800]  was like tweeting, Jones is obviously been paid off to do this by Kaiser, Kaiser tried
[1:33:51.800 --> 1:33:56.640]  to give me 10,000 Bitcoin 10 years ago, I didn't know how to take him like an idiot,
[1:33:56.640 --> 1:34:01.280]  he found the laptop, it's not on there, he was trying to get it on there, he remembers
[1:34:01.280 --> 1:34:05.440]  that it didn't work and we went and checked, I guess he's right, he tried to give it to
[1:34:05.440 --> 1:34:09.760]  me then, didn't offer to give me money two years ago, I wish I had to listen to him then,
[1:34:09.760 --> 1:34:14.600]  because I could have funded this whole operation with a $50,000 investment, but it brought
[1:34:14.600 --> 1:34:20.040]  me millions back to fund this operation and he's not paying me now to do it, I do have
[1:34:20.040 --> 1:34:26.960]  an account at swanbitcoin.com, because it's the big clean best place to go to do it all
[1:34:26.960 --> 1:34:31.600]  above board and totally legal and lawfully and they only make like 1% on it and I think
[1:34:31.600 --> 1:34:34.960]  we get paid like a little micron of that, we've gotten some money, a lot of folks have
[1:34:34.960 --> 1:34:39.680]  gone there and bought Bitcoin or trading in it and that's good, it funds our operation,
[1:34:39.680 --> 1:34:45.880]  but for me, getting into Bitcoin is something I should have done, but I wanted to be sure
[1:34:45.880 --> 1:34:50.240]  about it before I told people and by sure, I'm not saying the world might not blow up
[1:34:50.240 --> 1:34:54.760]  next week, you know, Christ might come back, nuclear war might start, what I'm saying is
[1:34:54.760 --> 1:34:59.600]  I wish I had got into it 10 years ago, when somebody got a track record that good is Max,
[1:34:59.600 --> 1:35:03.520]  I'm listening now and I expected, my wife was asking me a week ago, she goes, before
[1:35:03.520 --> 1:35:08.160]  this thing started, she goes, should I invest, I said, you can do whatever you want but be
[1:35:08.160 --> 1:35:11.280]  ready for it to go down, I think it's going to go down the next few months quite a bit,
[1:35:11.280 --> 1:35:18.120]  I think it's going to go back up again, that's how this works and listen, it's up against
[1:35:18.120 --> 1:35:22.880]  a bunch of other fiat currencies that are totally worthless, backed by no technology,
[1:35:22.880 --> 1:35:27.160]  backed by nothing and so to have those very groups criticizing and it has no credibility
[1:35:27.160 --> 1:35:35.040]  for me, all I'm saying is in the future, we all need to be invested in all sorts of things
[1:35:35.040 --> 1:35:41.160]  because we're in a wild speculation atmosphere, governments everywhere are in a race to devalue
[1:35:41.160 --> 1:35:48.200]  their currency, so I'm just looking into things to try to have some backup or some protection
[1:35:48.200 --> 1:35:52.400]  and personally made the decision to start promoting Bitcoin because I made the decision
[1:35:52.400 --> 1:35:56.360]  to get into it, doesn't mean I have all the answers, doesn't mean I'm perfect, but what's
[1:35:56.360 --> 1:36:01.360]  good for the goose is good for the gander and I'm ranting, we have Max on for a few
[1:36:01.360 --> 1:36:05.680]  more minutes, I maxed other points on Bitcoin, I think we've got a lot of points to make,
[1:36:05.680 --> 1:36:11.280]  these currencies, these governments, the Biden spending, what's happening with the EU, already
[1:36:11.280 --> 1:36:18.720]  inflation exploding, food prices in the Bloomberg index are up 76%, by the end of summer, I'm
[1:36:18.720 --> 1:36:22.760]  already seeing that here, I mean, what the hell is really going on here?
[1:36:22.760 --> 1:36:28.520]  Well, a couple of points there on the Peter Schiff thing, so the reason he's so bitter
[1:36:28.520 --> 1:36:34.760]  about all this is that I, like you, I was at his house in Connecticut and I sat down
[1:36:34.760 --> 1:36:39.600]  with him for a long time, I played pool in his basement talking to him about Bitcoin
[1:36:39.600 --> 1:36:44.760]  when it was under $10 and I was saying, look, Peter, we've known each other for a long time
[1:36:44.760 --> 1:36:50.360]  and take a close look at this, this thing is the real deal and then he didn't go for
[1:36:50.360 --> 1:36:56.600]  it and then I did it again at $100, $500, $1,000 and then after a while it just got
[1:36:56.600 --> 1:37:01.400]  ludicrous because he started bashing Bitcoin and I realized he's just really kicking himself
[1:37:01.400 --> 1:37:04.800]  because it would have completely changed his career.
[1:37:04.800 --> 1:37:09.320]  Instead of being in these foreign gold mining stocks priced in currencies other than the
[1:37:09.320 --> 1:37:14.800]  dollar and he's lost his clients 80 and 90%, he would have had this amazing career but
[1:37:14.800 --> 1:37:15.800]  he blew it.
[1:37:15.800 --> 1:37:21.680]  As far as those 10,000 Bitcoin that you talk about that we talked about on your show, it's
[1:37:21.680 --> 1:37:27.480]  wrong to say that they are lost, that, you know, they're not lost, you know, I offered
[1:37:27.480 --> 1:37:33.240]  to give your audience 10,000 coins back when it was under $5 as a way to spread the love
[1:37:33.240 --> 1:37:38.320]  and it never happened but I think it's incorrect to say they are lost.
[1:37:38.320 --> 1:37:42.880]  So moving along, no, you're right, other smart people, other smart people got them or you
[1:37:42.880 --> 1:37:43.880]  gave them away to other people.
[1:37:43.880 --> 1:37:44.880]  We know that.
[1:37:44.880 --> 1:37:45.880]  Yeah.
[1:37:45.880 --> 1:37:46.880]  Yeah.
[1:37:46.880 --> 1:37:47.880]  They're not lost.
[1:37:47.880 --> 1:37:48.880]  So let's talk about it.
[1:37:48.880 --> 1:37:49.880]  Yeah.
[1:37:49.880 --> 1:37:50.880]  They're probably right there in your wallet.
[1:37:50.880 --> 1:37:54.360]  I will now take them.
[1:37:54.360 --> 1:37:57.600]  What's not going to happen is they're uncompestable.
[1:37:57.600 --> 1:37:58.600]  I understand.
[1:37:58.600 --> 1:38:01.600]  I'm coming to your house.
[1:38:01.600 --> 1:38:03.600]  They're not here.
[1:38:03.600 --> 1:38:10.280]  No, I use multi-seg, you know, which is a very advanced protection.
[1:38:10.280 --> 1:38:12.280]  Well, that's another question.
[1:38:12.280 --> 1:38:14.280]  What is it like for people?
[1:38:14.280 --> 1:38:20.960]  What is it like for somebody safety-wise that is obviously sitting on top of a pile of Bitcoin
[1:38:20.960 --> 1:38:24.320]  that would rival Smog's Horde of Gold?
[1:38:24.320 --> 1:38:28.760]  I go to keys.casa, which is another company you should check out.
[1:38:28.760 --> 1:38:31.440]  They offer the best security in the industry.
[1:38:31.440 --> 1:38:32.880]  It's called multiple signature.
[1:38:32.880 --> 1:38:36.880]  It's like having keys to a safe deposit box or you need multiple keys to open up the safe
[1:38:36.880 --> 1:38:37.880]  deposit box.
[1:38:37.880 --> 1:38:38.880]  It's like launching nuclear weapons.
[1:38:38.880 --> 1:38:40.480]  Yeah, exactly.
[1:38:40.480 --> 1:38:41.800]  And so that's where it all is.
[1:38:41.800 --> 1:38:44.840]  Even if you were to kidnap me and put a gun to my head, you still couldn't have access
[1:38:44.840 --> 1:38:50.280]  to my coins the way that the security is set up over at keys.casa, they are the best in
[1:38:50.280 --> 1:38:51.280]  the industry.
[1:38:51.280 --> 1:38:56.640]  Along with swan, I only talk really about two companies, swan and keys.casa.
[1:38:56.640 --> 1:38:58.200]  And those are the two outstanding companies.
[1:38:58.200 --> 1:39:02.000]  You get those two together and you've got the maximum security and you've got the easiest
[1:39:02.000 --> 1:39:04.520]  cheapest way to acquire Bitcoin through swan.
[1:39:04.520 --> 1:39:09.520]  Those are the two, the path to making it on individually wealthy.
[1:39:09.520 --> 1:39:13.520]  Just do dollar cost averaging, let Bitcoin do for you what you can't do for yourself.
[1:39:13.520 --> 1:39:14.520]  Well, do you think I'm smart?
[1:39:14.520 --> 1:39:15.520]  Do you think I'm smart?
[1:39:15.520 --> 1:39:19.880]  Because my gut level when I was trying to get you on yesterday, I told my wife, I said,
[1:39:19.880 --> 1:39:22.000]  I think now's the time for you to buy some Bitcoin.
[1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:25.800]  She wants to buy a little and she listened to me and I said, I'm going to ask Max Kaiser
[1:39:25.800 --> 1:39:26.800]  for you on air.
[1:39:26.800 --> 1:39:28.120]  She said, will you ask Max?
[1:39:28.120 --> 1:39:31.640]  Is this a good time for her to probably buy some?
[1:39:31.640 --> 1:39:36.040]  Any day is a good day, but after we've had this correction and I've seen 15 corrections
[1:39:36.040 --> 1:39:42.160]  over 11 years and this is the eighth, biggest one, it's always pays to buy on these full
[1:39:42.160 --> 1:39:44.440]  backs always and it always will be.
[1:39:44.440 --> 1:39:47.600]  This is a gift that, you know, and I said in a couple of weeks, you're going to see
[1:39:47.600 --> 1:39:48.600]  new all time highs.
[1:39:48.600 --> 1:39:52.120]  You know, above 65,000, I'm going to be in Miami June 4th.
[1:39:52.120 --> 1:39:54.720]  I'm going to be at the Miami Bitcoin conference.
[1:39:54.720 --> 1:39:56.320]  I can sneak you in if you're interested.
[1:39:56.320 --> 1:39:58.120]  It's going to be the biggest event in America.
[1:39:58.120 --> 1:40:00.040]  It's going to have the biggest aims in Bitcoin.
[1:40:00.040 --> 1:40:02.040]  What is it again?
[1:40:02.040 --> 1:40:03.040]  Huge.
[1:40:03.040 --> 1:40:04.040]  June 4th and 5th.
[1:40:04.040 --> 1:40:05.040]  I think Tim Dillon is going to be there.
[1:40:05.040 --> 1:40:06.040]  Yeah.
[1:40:06.040 --> 1:40:09.360]  Tim Dillon is going to be there and Tony Hawk is going to be there.
[1:40:09.360 --> 1:40:10.360]  I'm going to be there.
[1:40:10.360 --> 1:40:11.360]  Of course.
[1:40:11.360 --> 1:40:15.000]  Well, let me say this, you haven't been wrong yet about the Bitcoin.
[1:40:15.000 --> 1:40:17.200]  You made a lot of predictions that have come true.
[1:40:17.200 --> 1:40:20.240]  You've been really accurate on the Bitcoin, you've been frighteningly accurate.
[1:40:20.240 --> 1:40:23.080]  So I hope you're right about this.
[1:40:23.080 --> 1:40:25.480]  It's up 300% in one year.
[1:40:25.480 --> 1:40:27.720]  Just if you go back a year, it's up 300%.
[1:40:27.720 --> 1:40:29.520]  So pulled back a little, it's meaningless.
[1:40:29.520 --> 1:40:32.320]  It's going to be at 60, 70,000 in another few weeks.
[1:40:32.320 --> 1:40:34.600]  It's going to be at 220,000 in 2021.
[1:40:34.600 --> 1:40:38.280]  So here's my last point on this and I'm just a guy that looks at this just organically,
[1:40:38.280 --> 1:40:41.880]  not as a wizard like you, seriously.
[1:40:41.880 --> 1:40:46.920]  All I see is China coming out with a horrible coin that they track control, that they admit
[1:40:46.920 --> 1:40:49.880]  they will devalue if they want or increase value.
[1:40:49.880 --> 1:40:50.880]  They admit it's all rigged.
[1:40:50.880 --> 1:40:51.880]  That's garbage.
[1:40:51.880 --> 1:40:56.120]  Bitcoin is going to elapsed out and go bad at a certain point.
[1:40:56.120 --> 1:41:00.680]  So if a government or somebody came out with something as good and was backing it, I might
[1:41:00.680 --> 1:41:04.080]  say, okay, but clearly there's a hunger for cryptocurrencies.
[1:41:04.080 --> 1:41:05.080]  No, wrong.
[1:41:05.080 --> 1:41:06.640]  Let me tell you something.
[1:41:06.640 --> 1:41:12.000]  That by definition, you're wrong because you're saying if a government does dot, dot, dot,
[1:41:12.000 --> 1:41:15.920]  that by definition is a centralized project.
[1:41:15.920 --> 1:41:18.200]  Bitcoin is decentralized.
[1:41:18.200 --> 1:41:19.200]  Nobody controls it.
[1:41:19.200 --> 1:41:25.080]  What I'm getting at is exactly nothing has the purity of this so far or the long running
[1:41:25.080 --> 1:41:26.080]  streak.
[1:41:26.080 --> 1:41:30.200]  Here's all I'm saying is I don't see anything out there that even begins to contend with
[1:41:30.200 --> 1:41:31.200]  Bitcoin.
[1:41:31.200 --> 1:41:32.800]  No, nothing.
[1:41:32.800 --> 1:41:36.040]  Everything else is centralized garbage.
[1:41:36.040 --> 1:41:40.680]  Even those hard forks like Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Satoshi Vision have failed to capture
[1:41:40.680 --> 1:41:42.200]  any meaningful share.
[1:41:42.200 --> 1:41:43.600]  They're dying on the vine.
[1:41:43.600 --> 1:41:48.160]  I would liken this to aerodynamics, like they have some jets and designs that were built
[1:41:48.160 --> 1:41:52.800]  in the 50s, like the S71 Blackbird, that they still, with computers, have trouble making
[1:41:52.800 --> 1:41:53.800]  a better fuselage.
[1:41:53.800 --> 1:41:58.240]  And so it's like that first really clean animal where they tried all these odors before,
[1:41:58.240 --> 1:42:02.680]  like you said, and finally it was done right and boom, it's that miracle and there it is.
[1:42:02.680 --> 1:42:04.240]  And now it can't be duplicated.
[1:42:04.240 --> 1:42:06.240]  That's exactly right.
[1:42:06.240 --> 1:42:07.240]  A great example.
[1:42:07.240 --> 1:42:08.480]  I'll give you another one.
[1:42:08.480 --> 1:42:12.920]  The protocol that runs the Internet, that came out and it runs the Internet and it's
[1:42:12.920 --> 1:42:17.920]  never been surpassed and it never will be because it's entrenched now in our daily lives.
[1:42:17.920 --> 1:42:22.440]  And so Bitcoin is, as you point out, it's perfect when it came out after 20 years of
[1:42:22.440 --> 1:42:23.440]  trying.
[1:42:23.440 --> 1:42:28.080]  And now it's changing the global economy and nothing can come along to displace it.
[1:42:28.080 --> 1:42:30.920]  You can only create digital scarcity once.
[1:42:30.920 --> 1:42:34.040]  And that's what happened on January 3rd, 2009.
[1:42:34.040 --> 1:42:40.120]  And you see what's happening with these countries and these people like Paul Krugman panicking.
[1:42:40.120 --> 1:42:44.480]  They're trying to throw out all the propaganda they can to derail this thing, but they simply
[1:42:44.480 --> 1:42:46.480]  can't do it.
[1:42:46.480 --> 1:42:49.560]  It's gobbling up all the energy, all the fiat money.
[1:42:49.560 --> 1:42:52.280]  I think it's going to look like a beach ball you hold under when they release it.
[1:42:52.280 --> 1:42:53.280]  It's going to explode.
[1:42:53.280 --> 1:42:54.280]  Max Kaiser, thank you, my friend.
[1:42:54.280 --> 1:43:01.080]  Yeah, you got it.
[1:43:01.080 --> 1:43:07.200]  Your voice counts when you share information, be it over the Internet or in person, it changes
[1:43:07.200 --> 1:43:08.200]  the world.
[1:43:08.200 --> 1:43:10.640]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[1:43:10.640 --> 1:43:12.160]  They know you're angry.
[1:43:12.160 --> 1:43:16.480]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool
[1:43:16.480 --> 1:43:17.480]  we've got.
[1:43:17.480 --> 1:43:21.680]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, if you sign up for our free news and show alerts, you can
[1:43:21.680 --> 1:43:25.920]  then take those alerts, those articles and those live feeds, both the regular shows and
[1:43:25.920 --> 1:43:28.400]  special reports, and share them with everyone you know.
[1:43:28.400 --> 1:43:35.760]  Take action now by texting the word news, NEWS, to 833-470-0438.
[1:43:35.760 --> 1:43:47.680]  Or text the word show to 833-470-0438 and receive live show notifications.
[1:43:47.680 --> 1:43:52.160]  Take action now, rate the chain reaction, and tell others to share those texts.
[1:43:52.160 --> 1:43:58.960]  Get news alerts at 833-470-0438.
[1:43:58.960 --> 1:44:02.320]  I'm not going to say this five times on the road to the obnoxious.
[1:44:02.320 --> 1:44:05.600]  I'm saying it because it's the key to victory over these criminals.
[1:44:05.600 --> 1:44:13.280]  Last week, the arch globalist Fauci admitted that roughly half of the CDC's top brass
[1:44:13.280 --> 1:44:18.280]  and workers, medical doctors, scientists, nurses, you name it, have taken the so-called
[1:44:18.280 --> 1:44:19.280]  COVID-19 frankenshot.
[1:44:19.280 --> 1:44:22.040]  I'm going to say it the second time.
[1:44:22.040 --> 1:44:29.840]  Around half of the doctors at the CDC and NIH refused to take the frankenshots.
[1:44:29.840 --> 1:44:31.400]  They don't trust it.
[1:44:31.400 --> 1:44:32.720]  You shouldn't trust it.
[1:44:32.720 --> 1:44:35.520]  The vaccines have been banned in most countries around the world.
[1:44:35.520 --> 1:44:38.680]  This is an attack on the American people, the people of the world.
[1:44:38.680 --> 1:44:42.080]  This is an absolute red flag, smoking gun.
[1:44:42.080 --> 1:44:44.960]  Again, let me say it two more times.
[1:44:44.960 --> 1:44:49.400]  Around half of the individuals that work at the NIH and CDC, the medical staff refused
[1:44:49.400 --> 1:44:50.400]  to take the vaccines.
[1:44:50.400 --> 1:44:51.400]  That's right.
[1:44:51.400 --> 1:44:55.720]  The doctors, nurses, scientists do not trust a so-called vaccine, and you, you shouldn't
[1:44:55.720 --> 1:44:56.720]  either.
[1:44:56.720 --> 1:44:58.920]  And you should warn everyone you know about the truth.
[1:44:58.920 --> 1:45:04.240]  The bio pros are the new non-GMO pollution solution using eco-friendly products to treat
[1:45:04.240 --> 1:45:06.240]  everyday problems while supporting our environment.
[1:45:06.240 --> 1:45:11.240]  For the first time, the bio pros are bringing to the public market a suite of bio remediation
[1:45:11.240 --> 1:45:13.080]  products to the everyday consumer.

[1:45:59.120 --> 1:46:03.440]  All of the experts agree that getting proper sleep is the cornerstone of good health.
[1:46:03.440 --> 1:46:08.000]  It has been proven that a poor sleep schedule is linked with numerous health problems, including
[1:46:08.000 --> 1:46:13.240]  weight gain, memory issues, mood changes, poor concentration, and even a weakened immune
[1:46:13.240 --> 1:46:14.240]  system.
[1:46:14.240 --> 1:46:20.240]  Introducing RocketRest, the new product from our Dr. Jones Naturals line at infowarstore.com.

[1:47:01.840 --> 1:47:24.320]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:24.320 --> 1:47:29.720]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, Owen Schreuer is coming up in about 13 minutes at 6 o'clock
[1:47:29.720 --> 1:47:36.160]  Central, 7 o'clock Eastern, 5 o'clock Mountain, that'll be a 4 o'clock Pacific.
[1:47:36.160 --> 1:47:42.160]  With Sunday Live, and he is loaded for bear as usual, he's so hungry to fight the globalists
[1:47:42.160 --> 1:47:43.160]  just like me.
[1:47:43.160 --> 1:47:46.920]  He comes in on Sundays, not just five days a week, 3 to 6 p.m. with the War Room that
[1:47:46.920 --> 1:47:49.000]  he hosts on the InfoWars Network.
[1:47:49.000 --> 1:47:51.160]  Didn't take any calls tonight.
[1:47:51.160 --> 1:47:53.120]  I'm going to take a lot of calls this next week.
[1:47:53.120 --> 1:47:54.120]  I kept my promise.
[1:47:54.120 --> 1:47:57.960]  I think before last, when I was in town, we took a ton of calls, over 300 calls that
[1:47:57.960 --> 1:47:58.960]  week.
[1:47:58.960 --> 1:47:59.960]  I'm going to break that.
[1:47:59.960 --> 1:48:05.480]  I want to take 500 calls, 500 calls next week, 100 calls a day.
[1:48:05.480 --> 1:48:10.120]  It's going to wear out the folks' answer in the phones, but we're going to do it.
[1:48:10.120 --> 1:48:12.560]  So look forward to that.
[1:48:12.560 --> 1:48:17.920]  It was Scott Bronson, one of our weekday producers that sent me a video that I'd seen many years
[1:48:17.920 --> 1:48:24.320]  ago that they pulled off YouTube because, you know, can't have anybody out there disagreeing
[1:48:24.320 --> 1:48:28.680]  with Big Pharma that vaccines have hurt people before.
[1:48:28.680 --> 1:48:31.320]  This is from 1976.
[1:48:31.320 --> 1:48:38.680]  I was two years old when 60 Minutes did a report, and, of course, this is really a whitewash.
[1:48:38.680 --> 1:48:42.600]  It turned out tens of thousands died from a swine flu vaccine.
[1:48:42.600 --> 1:48:47.360]  And I just showed you the discoverer of HIV saying that the vaccine is dangerous and that
[1:48:47.360 --> 1:48:50.200]  it's going to cause autoimmune disorders and heart attacks.
[1:48:50.200 --> 1:48:52.720]  Oh, oh, I almost forgot.
[1:48:52.720 --> 1:48:56.280]  That's mainstream news today.
[1:48:56.280 --> 1:48:57.280]  That's mainstream news.
[1:48:57.280 --> 1:49:00.360]  So when we come back after this clip, I'm going to play you and show you some of the
[1:49:00.360 --> 1:49:05.600]  articles where they're admitting heart attacks in young people who are totally healthy from
[1:49:05.600 --> 1:49:10.640]  the different vaccines, just like scientists warned it would because they've done similar
[1:49:10.640 --> 1:49:16.440]  studies on similar mRNA vaccines and these protein-based vaccines before.
[1:49:16.440 --> 1:49:17.880]  So this is insane, folks.
[1:49:17.880 --> 1:49:20.520]  They knew it would do this, and they're doing it.
[1:49:20.520 --> 1:49:21.520]  And you ask, why?
[1:49:21.520 --> 1:49:22.520]  Well, they're going to commit a massive crime.
[1:49:22.520 --> 1:49:27.720]  Get so many people signed on to it, parents, doctors, lawyers, scientists, Congress.
[1:49:27.720 --> 1:49:29.200]  Trump won't go back now.
[1:49:29.200 --> 1:49:30.440]  He's stubborn.
[1:49:30.440 --> 1:49:35.000]  And then when there's mass death and illness from it that weighs down the whole world,
[1:49:35.000 --> 1:49:37.120]  people won't admit that it happened, and they'll go get more.
[1:49:37.120 --> 1:49:38.120]  And you see the women on TV?
[1:49:38.120 --> 1:49:42.200]  Well, I'm paralyzed, but I'll still get more, or while my daughter died, but it was good
[1:49:42.200 --> 1:49:43.200]  to take her.
[1:49:43.200 --> 1:49:44.200]  Ben's died.
[1:49:44.200 --> 1:49:47.840]  Well, I almost died, but I'm glad I took it.
[1:49:47.840 --> 1:49:49.840]  Then they go out and get COVID-19 again.
[1:49:49.840 --> 1:49:53.480]  So, oh, let's turn the PCR test down from 40 to 28.
[1:49:53.480 --> 1:49:55.520]  It's just fraud on top of fraud.
[1:49:55.520 --> 1:50:00.760]  So I'll be covering this throughout the week, and I'm going to go back to the last few months'
[1:50:00.760 --> 1:50:04.720]  news and just get all the bombshells that have broken, like the one that broke two weeks
[1:50:04.720 --> 1:50:05.720]  ago.
[1:50:05.720 --> 1:50:08.120]  There was a blip on the radar screen.
[1:50:08.120 --> 1:50:12.000]  Fauci admits half the CDC and NIH have taken the shot.
[1:50:12.000 --> 1:50:13.080]  And I talked to medical doctors.
[1:50:13.080 --> 1:50:17.360]  They tell me, yeah, about half the nurses and doctors are refusing at regular practices.
[1:50:17.360 --> 1:50:18.600]  I'd add a physician.
[1:50:18.600 --> 1:50:21.520]  No one he knows is the physician's taking it.
[1:50:21.520 --> 1:50:23.840]  The doctors won't take it, but we're supposed to.
[1:50:23.840 --> 1:50:27.640]  And Bloomberg and others are saying, let's force the public to take shots now.
[1:50:27.640 --> 1:50:30.520]  I'll be covering that when we kick the show off tomorrow at 11 a.m.
[1:50:30.520 --> 1:50:32.880]  Oh, and I almost forgot.
[1:50:32.880 --> 1:50:37.760]  Nick Foynchez, I don't want to call him pro-Palestinian.
[1:50:37.760 --> 1:50:40.680]  He just doesn't think we should put Israel first.
[1:50:40.680 --> 1:50:43.720]  He's going to be debating Robert Barnes, who thinks that Israel's doing the right thing
[1:50:43.720 --> 1:50:44.720]  over there.
[1:50:44.720 --> 1:50:46.160]  They have a ceasefire, all the rest of it.
[1:50:46.160 --> 1:50:48.720]  They're going to debate six to like 9 p.m.
[1:50:48.720 --> 1:50:52.440]  It's going to be an hour and a half debate, but we'll afterwards take calls at your take
[1:50:52.440 --> 1:50:53.440]  on it.
[1:50:53.440 --> 1:50:54.600]  But it kicks off at 6 p.m.
[1:50:54.600 --> 1:51:00.920]  Tuesday, live, no commercials, unedited, the great debate, Middle Eastern crisis, Tuesday,
[1:51:00.920 --> 1:51:07.120]  May 25th, 2021, 6 p.m., Central Center Time, Barnes versus Foynchez, and they're both smart
[1:51:07.120 --> 1:51:08.120]  guys.
[1:51:08.120 --> 1:51:09.280]  It should be interesting.
[1:51:09.280 --> 1:51:15.920]  It's greatdebate.news.
[1:51:15.920 --> 1:51:24.040]  Let's go ahead now, ladies and gentlemen, and go to that 60 minutes report from 1976.
[1:51:24.040 --> 1:51:30.840]  Dr. Michael Hapwick directed the surveillance team for the swine flu program at the CDC.
[1:51:30.840 --> 1:51:36.040]  His job was to find out what possible complications could arise from taking the shot and to report
[1:51:36.040 --> 1:51:38.920]  his findings to those in charge.
[1:51:38.920 --> 1:51:45.280]  Did you know ahead of time, Dr. Hapwick, that there had been case reports of neurological
[1:51:45.280 --> 1:51:51.000]  disorders, neurological illness, apparently associated with the injection of influenza
[1:51:51.000 --> 1:51:52.000]  vaccine?
[1:51:52.000 --> 1:51:53.000]  Absolutely.
[1:51:53.000 --> 1:51:54.000]  You did?
[1:51:54.000 --> 1:51:55.000]  Yes.
[1:51:55.000 --> 1:51:56.000]  How'd you know that?
[1:51:56.000 --> 1:51:57.360]  By review of the literature.
[1:51:57.360 --> 1:52:02.280]  So you told your superiors, the men in charge of the swine flu immunization program, about
[1:52:02.280 --> 1:52:05.120]  the possibility of neurological disorders?
[1:52:05.120 --> 1:52:06.120]  Absolutely.
[1:52:06.120 --> 1:52:09.760]  What would you say if I told you that your superiors say that you never told them about
[1:52:09.760 --> 1:52:12.760]  the possibility of neurological complications?
[1:52:12.760 --> 1:52:13.760]  That's nonsense.
[1:52:13.760 --> 1:52:19.040]  I can't believe that they would say that they did not know that there were neurological
[1:52:19.040 --> 1:52:22.120]  illnesses associated with influenza vaccination.
[1:52:22.120 --> 1:52:23.520]  That simply is not true.
[1:52:23.520 --> 1:52:25.520]  We did know that.
[1:52:25.520 --> 1:52:35.000]  I've said that Dr. Hapwick never told me of his feelings on this subject, that he's lying.
[1:52:35.000 --> 1:52:39.480]  I guess you would have to make that assumption.
[1:52:39.480 --> 1:52:47.720]  And why does this report from your own agency, dated July 1976, list neurological complications
[1:52:47.720 --> 1:52:49.200]  as a possibility?
[1:52:49.200 --> 1:52:58.800]  I think the consensus of the scientific community was that the evidence relating neurological
[1:52:58.800 --> 1:53:06.320]  disorders to influenza immunization was such that they did not feel that this association
[1:53:06.320 --> 1:53:08.000]  was a real one.
[1:53:08.000 --> 1:53:13.560]  We didn't feel it was necessary to tell the American people that information.
[1:53:13.560 --> 1:53:18.760]  I think that over the years we have tried to inform the American people as fully as
[1:53:18.760 --> 1:53:20.080]  possible.
[1:53:20.080 --> 1:53:25.200]  As part of informing Americans about the swine flu threat, Dr. Sensor's CDC also helped
[1:53:25.200 --> 1:53:28.560]  create the advertising to get the public to take the shot.
[1:53:28.560 --> 1:53:29.920]  You're in charge.
[1:53:29.920 --> 1:53:32.920]  Somebody's in charge.
[1:53:32.920 --> 1:53:36.520]  This is your advertising strategy that I have a copy of here.
[1:53:36.520 --> 1:53:38.120]  Who's it signed by?
[1:53:38.120 --> 1:53:41.120]  This one is unsigned.
[1:53:41.120 --> 1:53:45.200]  But you'll acknowledge that it was your baby, so to speak.
[1:53:45.200 --> 1:53:51.640]  Well, as you realize, the CDC is a for-profit company with governmental protections.
[1:53:51.640 --> 1:53:57.400]  You do realize they own a controlling interest in all the vaccines ever approved here in
[1:53:57.400 --> 1:53:59.520]  the United States.
[1:53:59.520 --> 1:54:01.640]  And similar scams are run worldwide.
[1:54:01.640 --> 1:54:08.080]  You do know Bill Gates-Pratt that he makes 20-to-1 profits off his vaccine investments,
[1:54:08.080 --> 1:54:10.040]  which then are tax exempt.
[1:54:10.040 --> 1:54:15.920]  So again, they have liability protection given to him in 1986, a decade after what you just
[1:54:15.920 --> 1:54:16.920]  saw there.
[1:54:16.920 --> 1:54:20.640]  And later, they pulled the swine flu vaccine when it turned out that it killed a bunch
[1:54:20.640 --> 1:54:21.640]  of people.
[1:54:21.640 --> 1:54:25.640]  You know, autism wasn't even something 40 years ago.
[1:54:25.640 --> 1:54:28.720]  The term wasn't invented yet, kind of like pediatric cancer.
[1:54:28.720 --> 1:54:33.360]  Doctors in the 50s and 60s would get on an airplane and fly across the United States
[1:54:33.360 --> 1:54:35.000]  to see a child with cancer.
[1:54:35.000 --> 1:54:38.160]  It was like finding a unicorn.
[1:54:38.160 --> 1:54:41.080]  Now you can't swing a stick and not hit children with cancer.
[1:54:41.080 --> 1:54:46.680]  There's a lot of reasons that's happening, but let's expand on autism.
[1:54:46.680 --> 1:54:53.400]  In 1980, look up the numbers, one in 35,000 children had autism.
[1:54:53.400 --> 1:54:55.920]  Today it's one in 58.
[1:54:55.920 --> 1:55:00.320]  And some numbers show this by the year 2030, it's going to be one in 22.
[1:55:00.320 --> 1:55:04.120]  Hell, in South Korea, it's already one in 30 something.
[1:55:04.120 --> 1:55:06.160]  Look it up for yourself.
[1:55:06.160 --> 1:55:10.000]  Sudden infant death syndrome, they know that's vaccines and babies.
[1:55:10.000 --> 1:55:11.640]  Babies have always slumped on their faces.
[1:55:11.640 --> 1:55:16.920]  The Australian government did two studies and had to find, okay, it's the vaccines.
[1:55:16.920 --> 1:55:19.280]  Oh, your baby got a shot today.
[1:55:19.280 --> 1:55:23.960]  We don't know why it's dead the next morning.
[1:55:23.960 --> 1:55:28.040]  You know, when a bee stings somebody, thousands die here from bee stings, they swell up, die,
[1:55:28.040 --> 1:55:31.800]  didn't get an ambulance call, didn't take an EpiPen, didn't know what to do.
[1:55:31.800 --> 1:55:35.400]  They go, oh, they died from anaphylactic shock from a bee.
[1:55:35.400 --> 1:55:38.040]  What a cobra bite, you were a rattlesnake, and you died.
[1:55:38.040 --> 1:55:42.280]  They said a black widow, a brown recluse, but when it's a vaccine, the very medical
[1:55:42.280 --> 1:55:49.760]  system that's pushing it on you says, we don't know what did it.
[1:55:49.760 --> 1:55:54.160]  That is the reality, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:55:54.160 --> 1:55:56.960]  Yeah, that's a global Western average.
[1:55:56.960 --> 1:56:01.280]  Oh, by the way, autism didn't exist in the third world until they started the MMR shots.
[1:56:01.280 --> 1:56:02.280]  Now it doesn't.
[1:56:02.280 --> 1:56:05.320]  Oh, breast cancer didn't exist, basically, in Brazil.
[1:56:05.320 --> 1:56:08.800]  Now that Roundup's been adopted for 20-something years, they're just as bad as us.
[1:56:08.800 --> 1:56:13.400]  And almost every woman I know, about the age of 45, ends up getting breast cancer and their
[1:56:13.400 --> 1:56:14.880]  breast cut off.
[1:56:14.880 --> 1:56:20.680]  And I shouldn't get upset about that because, well, you know, there's just too many people,
[1:56:20.680 --> 1:56:21.680]  aren't there?
[1:56:21.680 --> 1:56:22.840]  All right, look, I'm out of time.
[1:56:22.840 --> 1:56:27.560]  I mentioned this here's the article, CDC investigating heart problems as teens and young adults
[1:56:27.560 --> 1:56:30.400]  who took second dose of COVID vaccines having heart attacks.
[1:56:30.400 --> 1:56:34.160]  That's a big article, Canadian government lures children with ice cream, take COVID vaccines
[1:56:34.160 --> 1:56:37.600]  without parental consent, actually have the documents, they're like, oh, just come get
[1:56:37.600 --> 1:56:41.120]  your ice cream with little children, like perverts, like pedophiles and, you know, ice
[1:56:41.120 --> 1:56:45.560]  cream trucks, same deal, same allure, and it just goes on.
[1:56:45.560 --> 1:56:50.640]  Okay, tomorrow at 11 a.m. central, but Owen's about to take over two hours live, your station
[1:56:50.640 --> 1:56:55.360]  is carrying it, ask him to politely, and you can always shoot into Band-Aid video in FullWars.com
[1:56:55.360 --> 1:56:58.480]  for its live show and share that link.

[1:58:48.920 --> 1:58:55.280]  Globalist puppet Joe Biden wasted no time blaming Russia with no evidence for the shutdown
[1:58:55.280 --> 1:59:00.400]  of the East Coast gasoline pipeline that goes from Houston right up through New York City
[1:59:00.400 --> 1:59:03.200]  and supplies more than half of the gasoline to the East Coast.
[1:59:03.200 --> 1:59:08.120]  But who is it that actually shut down the main pipeline from Canada through the Midwest
[1:59:08.120 --> 1:59:13.280]  to Houston to refine the oil that's then turned into gas and sent to the East Coast?
[1:59:13.280 --> 1:59:14.280]  That's right.
[1:59:14.280 --> 1:59:18.600]  Joe Biden shut down the Keystone pipeline right after it was completed.
[1:59:18.600 --> 1:59:20.760]  Joe Biden did that to America.
[1:59:20.760 --> 1:59:21.760]  He has the history.
[1:59:21.760 --> 1:59:22.760]  He has the background.
[1:59:22.760 --> 1:59:26.280]  He's the one that promised to, quote, get us off of fossil fuels.
[1:59:26.280 --> 1:59:30.640]  He's the one that's tried to extend the lockdowns of the country.
[1:59:30.640 --> 1:59:34.720]  Remember, ladies and gentlemen, that the New World Order wants a post-industrial world and
[1:59:34.720 --> 1:59:40.280]  they want the United States, Europe and Australia crippled so Communist China can't be dominant.
[1:59:40.280 --> 1:59:41.800]  It's not Russia that's the enemy.
[1:59:41.800 --> 1:59:46.520]  It's Communist China and their millions like Joe Biden in control of the White House.
[1:59:46.520 --> 1:59:47.520]  That's the facts.
[1:59:47.520 --> 1:59:51.760]  That's the information.
[1:59:51.760 --> 2:00:02.040]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
