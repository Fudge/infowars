[00:00.000 --> 00:06.000]  It's Tuesday, July 26, 2022.
[00:06.000 --> 00:08.000]  We're not supposed to be out of here.
[00:08.000 --> 00:10.000]  We're supposed to be shut down.
[00:14.000 --> 00:18.000]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:20.000 --> 00:23.000]  The New World Order is making its move.
[00:23.000 --> 00:25.000]  Humanity is waking up fast.
[00:25.000 --> 00:29.000]  The Great Resets Arch Enemy is the Great Awakening.
[00:29.000 --> 00:36.000]  Infowars is the recognized heart of the zeitgeist of the global Great Awakening
[00:36.000 --> 00:39.000]  for the anti-human tyranny of the New World Order.
[00:39.000 --> 00:42.000]  And that's why they're fighting around the clock to silence us,
[00:42.000 --> 00:44.000]  so they can get to you.
[00:46.000 --> 00:48.000]  But you've been backing us, you've been supporting us,
[00:48.000 --> 00:50.000]  and we're still here thanks to your prayers,
[00:50.000 --> 00:52.000]  your word of mouth,
[00:52.000 --> 00:57.000]  and your financial support at infowarstore.com.
[00:57.000 --> 01:01.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:01.000 --> 01:07.000]  we've got so much to hit today, so much to cover, so much to lay out for you.
[01:07.000 --> 01:10.000]  We've got all the big breaking news coming up,
[01:10.000 --> 01:13.000]  but first I want to talk big picture with everybody.
[01:13.000 --> 01:17.000]  I'm going to play three clips when we come back in the next segment
[01:17.000 --> 01:22.000]  that illustrate why the enemy cannot have an Alex Jones
[01:22.000 --> 01:26.000]  or a Tucker Carlson or a Joe Rogan
[01:26.000 --> 01:30.000]  when he's got his head completely screwed on straight or so many others.
[01:30.000 --> 01:35.000]  Because when we have memories and remember the lies they told
[01:35.000 --> 01:38.000]  and how they changed their stories and then have a platform
[01:38.000 --> 01:42.000]  to show how they're doing 180s all the time,
[01:42.000 --> 01:47.000]  it's game over for them when they run these confidence games.
[01:47.000 --> 01:52.000]  That said, as bad as I thought this country was off,
[01:52.000 --> 01:55.000]  as bad as I thought the world was off,
[01:55.000 --> 01:59.000]  I have gotten a real education the last four years dealing with
[01:59.000 --> 02:04.000]  the different Democrat control jurisdictions like D.C. and Austin, Texas,
[02:04.000 --> 02:06.000]  who are admittedly the two most tyrannical,
[02:06.000 --> 02:10.000]  authoritarian and weaponized judiciary in the nation
[02:10.000 --> 02:18.000]  and perfected rigging juries and rigging trials and just you name it.
[02:18.000 --> 02:23.000]  Steve Bannon got convicted for saying he had executive privilege,
[02:23.000 --> 02:27.000]  which he clearly had as an advisor to the president by D.C. Jury
[02:27.000 --> 02:30.000]  and he wasn't basically allowed to talk at the trial.
[02:30.000 --> 02:34.000]  The new said, oh, the judge said it wasn't important what he wanted to say
[02:34.000 --> 02:39.000]  or his lawyers wanted to say to those people there accusing him as witnesses.
[02:39.000 --> 02:41.000]  They said the facts were already clear.
[02:41.000 --> 02:43.000]  That was in the news.
[02:43.000 --> 02:45.000]  Steve Bannon not allowed to cross-examine
[02:45.000 --> 02:49.000]  and then left his meetings like, well, of course he's a bad person.
[02:49.000 --> 02:56.000]  Remember when the head of the IRS under Obama was doing audits
[02:56.000 --> 02:59.000]  of hundreds of thousands of conservative and Christian leaders
[02:59.000 --> 03:03.000]  and shutting down Christian 501C3s and churches that were conservative?
[03:03.000 --> 03:07.000]  And I remember MSNBC said, Rachel Maddow said, well, of course they are.
[03:07.000 --> 03:11.000]  They're Republicans. Of course we're shutting them down.
[03:11.000 --> 03:16.000]  So Steve Bannon could not cross-examine witnesses against him.
[03:16.000 --> 03:19.000]  And that is bedrock tearing.
[03:19.000 --> 03:21.000]  That is overthrow of the country.
[03:21.000 --> 03:25.000]  And Robert Barnes did a great job yesterday talking about it going over.
[03:25.000 --> 03:28.000]  He worked on the case some a few years ago.
[03:28.000 --> 03:30.000]  And archives of that are up at Band-Aid video.
[03:30.000 --> 03:32.000]  But it isn't about Alex Jones.
[03:32.000 --> 03:34.000]  It's about us all and the attack we're under.
[03:34.000 --> 03:36.000]  But it's on record.
[03:36.000 --> 03:38.000]  The judge put an order out two weeks ago saying,
[03:38.000 --> 03:43.000]  you will not mention free speech and you will not say you're innocent
[03:43.000 --> 03:47.000]  and you won't say you're bankrupt.
[03:47.000 --> 03:49.000]  It's incredible.
[03:49.000 --> 03:51.000]  I didn't kill the kids at Sandy Hook.
[03:51.000 --> 03:53.000]  Whatever you believe about that.
[03:53.000 --> 03:55.000]  But now they've superimposed.
[03:55.000 --> 03:59.000]  Owen Schreuer had the best analogy where Indiana Jones,
[03:59.000 --> 04:03.000]  where there's lost art, where he's got the sand that's the same weight
[04:03.000 --> 04:08.000]  and he's got the idle because he's done the research that there's a weighted
[04:08.000 --> 04:10.000]  booby trap there.
[04:10.000 --> 04:14.000]  He's got the sand and he puts the idle on right at the same time.
[04:14.000 --> 04:17.000]  He removes the idle, puts the sand on.
[04:17.000 --> 04:20.000]  And then he thinks he succeeded and then he notices it failed.
[04:20.000 --> 04:23.000]  It wasn't the right weight and then everything breaks loose.
[04:23.000 --> 04:25.000]  And that's what the left's doing.
[04:25.000 --> 04:27.000]  They're getting rid of all the due process.
[04:27.000 --> 04:30.000]  They are just steamrolling over any type of basic freedoms,
[04:30.000 --> 04:33.000]  not knowing they are making their own bed
[04:33.000 --> 04:37.000]  that they will be politically destroyed in the process of.
[04:37.000 --> 04:41.000]  So this is them dying politically. This is them collapsing.
[04:41.000 --> 04:43.000]  This is the end of the dinosaur media, the end of it all.
[04:43.000 --> 04:46.000]  And I'm just honored to be their main enemy in the attack.
[04:46.000 --> 04:48.000]  But we've got important work to continue.
[04:48.000 --> 04:50.000]  So please spread the word about this live broadcast today.
[04:50.000 --> 04:54.000]  And go to mfourstore.com where the new book is now available pre-order.
[04:54.000 --> 04:56.000]  We need the money right now plus it's a great book.
[04:56.000 --> 04:58.000]  Everybody should have the great reset with Alex Jones,
[04:58.000 --> 05:10.000]  The War for the World is here.
[05:10.000 --> 05:13.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is now more important than ever
[05:13.000 --> 05:16.000]  as we reach the critical heart of the battle,
[05:16.000 --> 05:19.000]  that you spread the word and that you support liberty
[05:19.000 --> 05:23.000]  and that you warn people like you've never done before.
[05:23.000 --> 05:25.000]  We have come so far together.
[05:25.000 --> 05:28.000]  Please help keep us from the year. We're under massive attack right now.
[05:28.000 --> 05:30.000]  But we're going to win with your help.
[05:30.000 --> 05:33.000]  We're going to overcome this with your help and with God's blessing.
[05:33.000 --> 05:36.000]  Please go to mfourstore.com and get this book.
[05:36.000 --> 05:39.000]  Many, many, many years of research have gone into this.
[05:39.000 --> 05:41.000]  The great reset and The War for the World
[05:41.000 --> 05:44.000]  available right now at mfourstore.com.
[05:44.000 --> 05:47.000]  There's also signed copies available as well.
[05:47.000 --> 05:49.000]  We've got a lot of other big projects we're working on
[05:49.000 --> 05:51.000]  that are about to start launching as well.
[05:51.000 --> 05:54.000]  But this is the cavalry because we need the funding
[05:54.000 --> 05:57.000]  and you need this book because it warns the world of the globalist plan.
[05:57.000 --> 06:26.000]  Get the great reset at mfourstore.com.
[06:27.000 --> 06:31.000]  This is a speech like a volcanic explosion.
[06:31.000 --> 06:34.000]  We are unstoppable.
[06:34.000 --> 06:40.000]  God's breath fills our sails.
[06:40.000 --> 06:42.000]  And if we weren't over the target,
[06:42.000 --> 06:45.000]  and if we weren't exposing and hurting the enemy
[06:45.000 --> 06:48.000]  and the pedophile armies of the New World Order and their minions,
[06:48.000 --> 06:50.000]  we wouldn't be under attack.
[06:50.000 --> 06:52.000]  But we are under attack
[06:52.000 --> 06:58.000]  and we are battling these forces.
[06:58.000 --> 07:01.000]  Make no mistake, the most hated broadcast in the world
[07:01.000 --> 07:03.000]  you're tuned in to right now
[07:03.000 --> 07:05.000]  because we're about to do something.
[07:05.000 --> 07:08.000]  The enemies of freedom cannot survive.
[07:08.000 --> 07:09.000]  No, we're not about to shoot them.
[07:09.000 --> 07:10.000]  We're not about to fireball them.
[07:10.000 --> 07:12.000]  We're not about to burn down their business
[07:12.000 --> 07:14.000]  or deplatform them like the left does.
[07:14.000 --> 07:21.000]  We are about to show you just a small sampling of context
[07:21.000 --> 07:23.000]  and what they've done over the years
[07:23.000 --> 07:27.000]  and how they're constantly doing 180s.
[07:27.000 --> 07:29.000]  They count on you not having a memory.
[07:29.000 --> 07:32.000]  They count on us not having a will.
[07:32.000 --> 07:34.000]  And they counted wrong.
[07:34.000 --> 07:38.000]  So here is a short smattering of the last few years
[07:38.000 --> 07:41.000]  of globalist minions like Biden and others
[07:41.000 --> 07:44.000]  saying, oh, the vaccine is 100% effective.
[07:44.000 --> 07:45.000]  You can't get the virus.
[07:45.000 --> 07:46.000]  You can't get sick.
[07:46.000 --> 07:49.000]  You can't spread it if you take it.
[07:49.000 --> 07:51.000]  And then the opposite is the truth
[07:51.000 --> 07:54.000]  that erases your immune system and gives you COVID.
[07:54.000 --> 07:57.000]  They don't want this show here
[07:57.000 --> 07:59.000]  because despite the fact that Facebook
[07:59.000 --> 08:02.000]  and Twitter and Instagram and Google and YouTube
[08:02.000 --> 08:05.000]  and all the rest of them, Reddit, you name it,
[08:05.000 --> 08:07.000]  are censoring this video clip.
[08:07.000 --> 08:09.000]  We're reaching millions of people
[08:09.000 --> 08:11.000]  on over 400 radio stations,
[08:11.000 --> 08:14.000]  over 100 TV and cable stations,
[08:14.000 --> 08:16.000]  and then millions that tune in
[08:16.000 --> 08:19.000]  for an info wars.com.
[08:19.000 --> 08:21.000]  And they are crapping their lying pants.
[08:21.000 --> 08:24.000]  The mercenaries that bought into this satanic neural order
[08:24.000 --> 08:27.000]  that, well, the people they're learning were frauds.
[08:27.000 --> 08:31.000]  Here's what they don't want you to see.
[08:31.000 --> 08:33.000]  You're okay.
[08:33.000 --> 08:37.000]  You're not going to get COVID if you have these vaccinations.
[08:37.000 --> 08:38.000]  Hey, folks.
[08:38.000 --> 08:40.000]  Yesterday, this morning, I tested positive for COVID.
[08:40.000 --> 08:42.000]  And when people are vaccinated,
[08:42.000 --> 08:45.000]  they can feel safe that they are not going to get infected.
[08:45.000 --> 08:48.000]  Dr. Fauci says he has COVID again.
[08:48.000 --> 08:51.000]  If you've done the right thing and gotten vaccinated,
[08:51.000 --> 08:55.000]  you deserve the freedom to be safe from COVID-19.
[08:55.000 --> 08:59.000]  And this morning, I learned I tested positive
[08:59.000 --> 09:01.000]  for COVID-19 as well.
[09:01.000 --> 09:03.000]  The free doses that you can prevent
[09:03.000 --> 09:05.000]  are not just from serious illness,
[09:05.000 --> 09:08.000]  but from getting this virus, this Omicron variant,
[09:08.000 --> 09:10.000]  and therefore giving it to others.
[09:10.000 --> 09:12.000]  Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews is in quarantine
[09:12.000 --> 09:14.000]  for seven days after testing positive to COVID.
[09:14.000 --> 09:16.000]  I'm fully vaccinated.
[09:16.000 --> 09:17.000]  Give me some comfort.
[09:17.000 --> 09:21.000]  Anthony Albanese has just tested positive for coronavirus.
[09:21.000 --> 09:24.000]  Having received two doses of AstraZeneca,
[09:24.000 --> 09:28.000]  it's a very effective vaccine protection from symptomatic illness
[09:28.000 --> 09:31.000]  and, therefore, risk of transmission to others.
[09:31.000 --> 09:33.000]  All lies.
[09:33.000 --> 09:36.000]  A real vaccine may have side effects, may be tainted,
[09:36.000 --> 09:41.000]  but it's 100% effective from polio, smallpox, you name it.
[09:41.000 --> 09:44.000]  Those are real vaccines where you give them an attenuated virus,
[09:44.000 --> 09:46.000]  your body learns how to beat it,
[09:46.000 --> 09:48.000]  unless it kills you in the process.
[09:48.000 --> 09:50.000]  But it's real.
[09:50.000 --> 09:51.000]  This is a gene therapy.
[09:51.000 --> 09:53.000]  It has nothing to do with that, and they all know it.
[09:53.000 --> 09:56.000]  And I'll play a Fauci in a moment admitting it.
[09:56.000 --> 09:58.000]  But they don't want you to see that.
[09:58.000 --> 10:03.000]  You know, they mentioned Jacinda Arden over there
[10:03.000 --> 10:05.000]  in the total police state.
[10:05.000 --> 10:07.000]  That's the highest rate of death and illness in the world,
[10:07.000 --> 10:10.000]  the highest rate of vaccine shots or fake vaccines
[10:10.000 --> 10:13.000]  than second is Israel after that, second most injected.
[10:13.000 --> 10:15.000]  Those are real numbers they don't want you to look at.
[10:15.000 --> 10:17.000]  Just write down what I say and look it up.
[10:17.000 --> 10:19.000]  They can't scan it.
[10:19.000 --> 10:24.000]  So here she is just recently saying,
[10:24.000 --> 10:28.000]  do not listen to anybody but us.
[10:28.000 --> 10:31.000]  And she put out the exact same propaganda
[10:31.000 --> 10:32.000]  that you just saw in the clip.
[10:32.000 --> 10:34.000]  In fact, she was in it.
[10:34.000 --> 10:35.000]  You cannot get the virus.
[10:35.000 --> 10:36.000]  You cannot spread it.
[10:36.000 --> 10:37.000]  You cannot get sick.
[10:37.000 --> 10:39.000]  If you take the shot, don't listen to anyone
[10:39.000 --> 10:40.000]  that tells you that.
[10:40.000 --> 10:43.000]  This was like a year into them knowing it didn't work.
[10:43.000 --> 10:45.000]  They always knew it didn't work.
[10:45.000 --> 10:47.000]  Here she is.
[10:47.000 --> 10:50.000]  The most up-to-date information daily.
[10:50.000 --> 10:53.000]  You can trust us as a source of that information.
[10:53.000 --> 10:56.000]  You can also trust the Director-General of Health
[10:56.000 --> 10:58.000]  and the Ministry of Health.
[10:58.000 --> 11:01.000]  For that information, do feel free to visit at any time
[11:01.000 --> 11:04.000]  to clarify any rumor you may hear.
[11:04.000 --> 11:07.000]  Covid19.govt.nz.
[11:07.000 --> 11:10.000]  Otherwise, dismiss anything else.
[11:10.000 --> 11:13.000]  We will continue to be your single source of truth.
[11:13.000 --> 11:16.000]  We will provide information frequently.
[11:16.000 --> 11:18.000]  We will share everything we can.
[11:18.000 --> 11:20.000]  Everything you are, else you see.
[11:20.000 --> 11:22.000]  A grain of salt.
[11:22.000 --> 11:24.000]  And so I really ask people to focus on that.
[11:24.000 --> 11:26.000]  Just an example of that appears to be this text
[11:26.000 --> 11:28.000]  which originated in Malaysia
[11:28.000 --> 11:30.000]  and has become a viral hoax in Australia
[11:30.000 --> 11:31.000]  and in New Zealand.
[11:31.000 --> 11:32.000]  How irresponsible is it
[11:32.000 --> 11:34.000]  the people that are sharing that news
[11:34.000 --> 11:36.000]  of a lockdown imminent in New Zealand?
[11:36.000 --> 11:38.000]  And look, that's the kind of thing that adds
[11:38.000 --> 11:40.000]  to the anxiety that people feel.
[11:40.000 --> 11:42.000]  So I continue to share the message.
[11:42.000 --> 11:44.000]  New Zealanders must prepare.
[11:44.000 --> 11:46.000]  But do not panic.
[11:46.000 --> 11:47.000]  Prepare.
[11:47.000 --> 11:49.000]  And when you see those messages,
[11:49.000 --> 11:52.000]  remember that unless you hear it from us,
[11:52.000 --> 11:54.000]  it is not the truth.
[11:54.000 --> 11:57.000]  And I really ask people, just visit
[11:57.000 --> 11:59.000]  Covid19.govt.nz.
[11:59.000 --> 12:02.000]  It has all of the up-to-date information.
[12:02.000 --> 12:07.000]  And we will continue to provide everything you need.
[12:07.000 --> 12:09.000]  This is a total medical tyranny taking over.
[12:09.000 --> 12:12.000]  A graduate of Klaus Schwab's propaganda bureau,
[12:12.000 --> 12:14.000]  he says, one of his top agents telling you
[12:14.000 --> 12:15.000]  don't look at what they say,
[12:15.000 --> 12:17.000]  just listen to me even though it's all lies.
[12:17.000 --> 12:19.000]  Now here's Fauci
[12:19.000 --> 12:21.000]  testifying back in 1999
[12:21.000 --> 12:23.000]  and there's a longer 20-minute interview of it,
[12:23.000 --> 12:25.000]  admitting why they couldn't put out
[12:25.000 --> 12:27.000]  an experimental AIDS vaccine,
[12:27.000 --> 12:29.000]  HIV vaccine, because it would kill you.
[12:29.000 --> 12:31.000]  But decades later, he just says
[12:31.000 --> 12:33.000]  ignore all that, let's just do this.
[12:33.000 --> 12:34.000]  Here it is.
[12:34.000 --> 12:36.000]  Any scientists are beginning to believe
[12:36.000 --> 12:38.000]  that a vaccine against AIDS
[12:38.000 --> 12:40.000]  may be impossible to make
[12:40.000 --> 12:42.000]  and too dangerous to test.
[12:42.000 --> 12:45.000]  If you take it and then a year goes by
[12:45.000 --> 12:47.000]  and everybody's fine,
[12:47.000 --> 12:49.000]  then you say, OK, that's good.
[12:49.000 --> 12:51.000]  Now let's give it to 500 people
[12:51.000 --> 12:53.000]  and then a year goes by and everything's fine.
[12:53.000 --> 12:56.000]  Say, well then now let's give it to thousands of people
[12:56.000 --> 12:58.000]  and then you find out that it takes
[12:58.000 --> 13:01.000]  12 years for all hell to break loose
[13:01.000 --> 13:03.000]  and then what have you done?
[13:03.000 --> 13:05.000]  All hell to break loose,
[13:05.000 --> 13:07.000]  exactly the real projections
[13:07.000 --> 13:09.000]  from the former head of Pfizer,
[13:09.000 --> 13:11.000]  chief scientist, all of them is
[13:11.000 --> 13:13.000]  massive heart attacks, blood clots,
[13:13.000 --> 13:15.000]  infertility the first few years,
[13:15.000 --> 13:17.000]  then massive mutations in cancer
[13:17.000 --> 13:18.000]  four to five years,
[13:18.000 --> 13:20.000]  and just total death of those
[13:20.000 --> 13:22.000]  that have taken it within 10.
[13:22.000 --> 13:24.000]  Because it turns out Obama
[13:24.000 --> 13:26.000]  tested at the University of Texas
[13:26.000 --> 13:29.000]  over a decade ago
[13:29.000 --> 13:32.000]  these exact mRNA injections on rats
[13:32.000 --> 13:34.000]  and a bunch of other mammals
[13:34.000 --> 13:36.000]  that are similar to humans in our physiology
[13:36.000 --> 13:38.000]  and it caused unbelievable death.
[13:38.000 --> 13:40.000]  Because remember, a rat only lives
[13:40.000 --> 13:42.000]  10% as long as a human.
[13:42.000 --> 13:44.000]  But it's very similar to us.
[13:44.000 --> 13:46.000]  So are pigs, they found.
[13:46.000 --> 13:48.000]  How it affects them, it's just compacted
[13:48.000 --> 13:50.000]  so you can do a quicker test and see what it does.
[13:50.000 --> 13:52.000]  With humans, you've got to wait 20, 30 years
[13:52.000 --> 13:54.000]  to see what's going to happen.
[13:54.000 --> 13:56.000]  Yeah, a couple years.
[13:56.000 --> 13:58.000]  Because with a rat, two, three years
[13:58.000 --> 14:00.000]  is like 30 years, like with a dog or a cat.
[14:04.000 --> 14:06.000]  I mean, wow, these people
[14:06.000 --> 14:08.000]  are damn monsters
[14:08.000 --> 14:10.000]  and that's why
[14:10.000 --> 14:12.000]  they don't want us on air
[14:12.000 --> 14:14.000]  to just show you that
[14:14.000 --> 14:16.000]  and break down
[14:16.000 --> 14:18.000]  all of this information.
[14:18.000 --> 14:20.000]  Now we come back, ladies and gentlemen,
[14:20.000 --> 14:22.000]  I mean, all hell is breaking loose
[14:22.000 --> 14:24.000]  around the world, the economy.
[14:24.000 --> 14:26.000]  The attacks on freedom
[14:26.000 --> 14:28.000]  are just becoming even more insane than ever.
[14:28.000 --> 14:30.000]  But I want to play a very important
[14:30.000 --> 14:32.000]  short clip when we come back
[14:32.000 --> 14:34.000]  that really illustrates
[14:34.000 --> 14:36.000]  why they want us off air.
[14:36.000 --> 14:38.000]  Because I did a little rant last week
[14:38.000 --> 14:40.000]  that got
[14:40.000 --> 14:42.000]  10 million views on Twitter
[14:42.000 --> 14:44.000]  and I didn't even track other places.
[14:44.000 --> 14:46.000]  It was like everywhere.
[14:46.000 --> 14:48.000]  But it sounded crazy.
[14:48.000 --> 14:50.000]  But listeners went
[14:50.000 --> 14:52.000]  and just put documents and articles
[14:52.000 --> 14:54.000]  over everything I said.
[14:54.000 --> 14:56.000]  Which you can do. And sometimes I'm wrong,
[14:56.000 --> 14:58.000]  like, you know, 3-4% of the time.
[14:58.000 --> 15:00.000]  And it's almost always because I underestimate
[15:00.000 --> 15:02.000]  how bad it's going to be.
[15:02.000 --> 15:04.000]  Usually it's I'm underestimated.
[15:04.000 --> 15:06.000]  But you don't need me to tell you about that anymore.
[15:06.000 --> 15:08.000]  You're watching them turn off your energy.
[15:08.000 --> 15:10.000]  You're watching them be no baby formula.
[15:10.000 --> 15:12.000]  You're watching them censor everybody.
[15:12.000 --> 15:14.000]  You're being censored. You're watching
[15:14.000 --> 15:16.000]  pedophiles come to your school
[15:16.000 --> 15:18.000]  and demand access to your children.
[15:18.000 --> 15:20.000]  Our government fund
[15:20.000 --> 15:22.000]  Real Nazis Highling Hitler in Ukraine.
[15:22.000 --> 15:24.000]  You are seeing it for yourself.
[15:24.000 --> 15:26.000]  And the good news is you fought hard
[15:26.000 --> 15:28.000]  and we're still on air because of it.
[15:28.000 --> 15:30.000]  But I'm asking you now more than ever
[15:30.000 --> 15:32.000]  to spread the word about Info Wars.
[15:32.000 --> 15:34.000]  Because our time is here.
[15:34.000 --> 15:36.000]  People are ready to listen.
[15:36.000 --> 15:38.000]  They wanted us off the air a long time before we got to this point.
[15:38.000 --> 15:40.000]  Because they knew once we launched the operation
[15:40.000 --> 15:42.000]  it's everything this guy said he'll have credibility.
[15:42.000 --> 15:44.000]  Well, guess what?
[15:44.000 --> 15:46.000]  Slugs, we're still on air
[15:46.000 --> 15:48.000]  and it's going straight up like a Saturn rocket.

[20:03.480 --> 20:08.480]  the New World Order. It's Alex Jones.
[20:13.480 --> 20:18.560]  Well I am fired up and very very blessed to be here on this Tuesday
[20:18.560 --> 20:25.320]  worldwide transmission and the fact that I'm even here is gonna send shock waves
[20:25.320 --> 20:29.560]  with the establishment media because I'm supposed to be in court today with the
[20:29.560 --> 20:33.520]  rigged trial where I've already been found guilty by Democratic Party George
[20:33.520 --> 20:37.680]  Soros funded judge where we came and tell the jury she works for George Soros
[20:37.680 --> 20:43.200]  or that we were defaulted or hey didn't you know there's a seventh amendment
[20:43.200 --> 20:49.720]  trial by jury to decide if I'm guilty oh they know what basis to cover they're
[20:49.720 --> 20:53.080]  gonna be freaking out that the corporate media is so dumb there's gonna be
[20:53.080 --> 20:58.440]  headlines today Alex Jones on air and he's supposed to be in court and they're
[20:58.440 --> 21:02.280]  gonna be fools because I'm gonna be in court we're taping at Monday night
[21:02.280 --> 21:08.720]  dumbasses they're so dumb they're gonna watch the start of the show where I'm
[21:08.720 --> 21:12.480]  in studio they'll already have articles everywhere before they figure out I take
[21:12.480 --> 21:16.640]  this because they are the kings of fake news they just take whatever's going on
[21:16.640 --> 21:21.440]  and comport it to whatever false reality they want that's not us they try to
[21:21.440 --> 21:25.680]  project on us that we're trying to lie when they wouldn't know the truth if it
[21:25.680 --> 21:34.360]  ran over him sorry I'm I'm pontificating let's go to this little clip that a
[21:34.360 --> 21:38.280]  listener put together Alex Jones on the Brave New World it's on Twitter for now
[21:38.280 --> 21:41.960]  they'll probably take it down they did I guess a larger podcast I haven't seen
[21:41.960 --> 21:44.800]  where they took everything I said and added documents to it but here's what
[21:44.800 --> 21:49.800]  they don't want is they don't want you looking into what I say there's 95% of
[21:49.800 --> 21:55.520]  the time you're gonna find out it's dead on here it is they expect to have a world
[21:55.520 --> 22:00.680]  government in which they are in controls where he went into the stacks at the UN
[22:00.680 --> 22:04.280]  actually got the documents in the 60s with the Club of Rome meetings where they
[22:04.280 --> 22:09.120]  said we're gonna promote homosexuality we're going to promote humans being
[22:09.120 --> 22:13.440]  sexless that's also in Brave New World 1932 people say how do they predict so
[22:13.440 --> 22:16.960]  much well honestly before he died in 61 wrote a book about it brave new world
[22:16.960 --> 22:20.720]  revisited nonfiction said no this is actual plan hatched by the British
[22:20.720 --> 22:28.200]  Empire model that was commissioned by Sir Francis Galton in 1855 with the Royal
[22:28.200 --> 22:33.560]  Commission so we're living in a Royal Commission where the British Empire said
[22:33.560 --> 22:38.800]  we want biometrics we want things called computers and we want to be able to
[22:38.800 --> 22:45.040]  learn the secrets of the human genome and we want to be able to program humans
[22:45.040 --> 22:49.280]  basically we manufactured in factories and you're like wait a minute they
[22:49.280 --> 22:54.640]  discovered the DNA until the 40s no they didn't talks the double helix the
[22:54.640 --> 22:59.920]  ancient Sumerian text Babylonian and Egyptian and Greek is two snacks intertwined
[22:59.920 --> 23:07.120]  they actually Galton invented biometrics invented the idea of computers and they
[23:07.120 --> 23:11.840]  they had hidden knowledge going back the play-doh didn't publish they held on to
[23:11.840 --> 23:16.400]  about advanced civilization that was here before and they had maps to the world
[23:16.400 --> 23:21.120]  and they all they knew all that stuff ladies and gentlemen they just kept the
[23:21.120 --> 23:26.560]  public dumb because they didn't want the public to understand it know it and
[23:26.560 --> 23:31.320]  then Christians with the Gutenberg press and the printing press began the
[23:31.320 --> 23:36.080]  Renaissance 550 years ago and the New World Order has been playing catch up and
[23:36.080 --> 23:44.280]  trying to suppress it ever since then so we innately see movies with robots and
[23:44.280 --> 23:50.600]  spaceships and it feels so familiar it feels so yesterday because it's
[23:50.600 --> 23:56.600]  epigenetics ladies and gentlemen that this planet is not the first rodeo and
[23:56.600 --> 24:02.080]  that's what they know they don't laugh at this they all know that and so it's
[24:02.080 --> 24:08.200]  here the second Atlantis and you know how Atlantis ended as subscribe star.com
[24:08.200 --> 24:14.600]  slash Irwin's real news good job Irwin's real news I'm gonna go watch that I
[24:14.600 --> 24:17.440]  haven't had time yet but I'm totally took everything we said just found
[24:17.440 --> 24:20.440]  documents to it which is mainline not it not not debated
[24:20.440 --> 24:25.240]  Galton goes there's a double helix I will create computers and biometrics and
[24:25.240 --> 24:28.720]  control them all and bring them into suboid slaves and get rid of the sexes
[24:28.720 --> 24:36.520]  and they're like yes sir you know how Galton did it mainline history you want
[24:36.520 --> 24:43.120]  to look it up. Astral projection off-world entities tell them how to do it
[24:43.120 --> 24:47.440]  yeah the transmission it just confirms the whole Bible everything else and
[24:47.440 --> 24:50.200]  you pull this out of their rear end ladies and gentlemen they pulled it
[24:50.200 --> 24:56.240]  right out of the interdimension warp so there's a satanic broadcast and there is
[24:56.240 --> 25:00.080]  a godly broadcast of what makes us strong which makes us good now radio
[25:00.080 --> 25:04.520]  listeners won't be able to see this but I'm gonna describe it this is a beetle
[25:04.520 --> 25:10.040]  that weighs maybe five percent and is in his maybe ten percent the weight of a
[25:10.040 --> 25:14.480]  big robot beetle of the same type it's an emperor beetle I forget the name
[25:14.480 --> 25:20.000]  attacking it and this little beetle overturns it scientists don't know how
[25:20.000 --> 25:23.360]  an ant can pick up something point on its way that's its magic folks that is
[25:23.360 --> 25:27.880]  they're so incredible and so I want to show you this beetle overturning
[25:27.880 --> 25:32.080]  Satan's AI then I want to show you the New World Order showing you what a
[25:32.080 --> 25:36.360]  supposedly a woman is it's pretty nightmarish and then Matt Gaetz has the
[25:36.360 --> 25:55.920]  answer how to respond to all this here at us
[25:55.920 --> 26:03.280]  and then there's this this is Satan telling us that some disgusting old man
[26:03.280 --> 26:09.400]  trying to act sexy is a woman and again I this fruit cake I don't dislike this
[26:09.400 --> 26:13.200]  person hate them but this is what they force feed us is stuff we don't want we
[26:13.200 --> 26:17.160]  don't need the poison the well
[26:17.520 --> 26:20.600]  we'll probably end up being the head of the nuclear weapons like the other guy
[26:20.600 --> 26:28.320]  is or the deputy head of the Department of Health they want lunatics there's
[26:28.320 --> 26:32.040]  only a little bit we go along with this so stop apologizing to them stop
[26:32.040 --> 26:35.640]  backing down so letting them bully you like Matt Gaetz said you go to the
[26:35.640 --> 26:38.960]  pro-abortion rally it's the most ugly discussed people ever just be honest
[26:38.960 --> 26:43.840]  about it no one wants to have sex with these women stop apologizing that's not
[26:43.840 --> 26:49.320]  a woman so I'm talking about Matt Gaetz right here in a moment
[26:50.520 --> 26:54.320]  is it safe to say that based off of your comments you're suggesting that these
[26:54.320 --> 26:59.680]  women at these abortion rallies are ugly and overweight yes what do you say to
[26:59.680 --> 27:04.240]  people who think that those comments are offensive be offended is it safe to say
[27:04.240 --> 27:07.200]  that based off of your comments you're suggesting that these women at these
[27:07.200 --> 27:12.320]  abortion rallies are ugly and overweight yes what do you say to people who think
[27:12.320 --> 27:16.640]  that those comments are offensive be offended is a safe to say that based

[27:19.720 --> 27:24.540]  rallies are ugly and overweight yes what do you see the people who think that
[27:24.540 --> 27:27.860]  those comments are offensive be offended okay
[27:27.860 --> 27:33.700]  You know, that's so important what he said. It's the key to everything three times isn't enough. Let's play it again
[27:34.340 --> 27:40.940]  Is it safe to say that based off of your comments? You're suggesting that these women at these abortion rallies are ugly and overweight?
[27:40.940 --> 27:42.180]  Yes
[27:42.180 --> 27:45.860]  What do you say to people who think that those comments are offensive be offended?
[27:47.060 --> 27:48.740]  You see these are bullies
[27:48.740 --> 27:54.740]  These are mind controllers that pick the most outrageous and same stuff to henpeck us into submission
[27:54.740 --> 28:00.660]  And when we give into that and let them do all this crazy stuff, they win they're in charge
[28:00.660 --> 28:03.460]  They're the authority they tell you we can hear see or you can do it
[28:03.740 --> 28:07.580]  They tell you what you should believe and it said to say okay be offended
[28:07.580 --> 28:09.660]  I mean listen, I'm not offended
[28:09.660 --> 28:13.940]  I used to look at Calvin Klein model and then over the years worked so hard did so much stuff
[28:13.940 --> 28:19.260]  Well stressed out that I became a disgusting fat blob and I go up and wait and down the way and I'll say I'm job of the hood
[28:19.260 --> 28:22.180]  I got a pumpkin head ha ha. I'm a fat ass. I don't care
[28:22.180 --> 28:27.100]  It's my intellect it matters and if people call me a fat ass. I'm not offended because it's their right to say it
[28:27.100 --> 28:32.580]  I go down. I better do some more push-ups. I guarantee you this I like to tell your jaw off your head still
[28:32.860 --> 28:37.940]  The whole point is is that I am thriving and the new world order is dying
[28:37.940 --> 28:41.020]  And we need to stop being intimidated by them and say the truth
[28:41.420 --> 28:46.220]  Because they're bullies and their control freaks and their evil and their scum and at the top
[28:46.220 --> 28:52.900]  They are pedophiles all these people were battling on the left their leadership our child raping demons
[28:53.220 --> 28:56.820]  Remember the people that attack us are pedophiles and they will pay

[32:19.860 --> 32:26.700]  There is nothing stopping we the people from making our own rules and building our own society

[32:32.300 --> 32:39.620]  The world fiat currency system is racing towards zero. It's time to convert it into hard assets now

[32:57.540 --> 33:06.100]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones
[33:09.700 --> 33:16.260]  Don't act so surprised globalist you didn't think you could silence the American people did you?

[33:43.900 --> 33:52.580]  You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he live from the info wars.com studios. It's Alex Jones
[33:53.060 --> 33:59.020]  We want to stop the great reset and the New World Order, and that's why they hate us and that's why they're so
[33:59.540 --> 34:03.820]  Incredibly scared ladies and gentlemen now. This isn't about Alex Jones. It's about you
[34:04.060 --> 34:10.420]  It's about their admitted battle plan and a blueprint and a beta test to expand this attack against everybody
[34:10.420 --> 34:15.580]  And we already told you that four years ago with any platforming. Here's the next level of it. Look at these headlines
[34:16.740 --> 34:22.580]  How much will Alex Jones pay for lying about Sandy Hook a jury will soon decide?
[34:24.060 --> 34:26.060]  Rolling Stone
[34:28.180 --> 34:36.980]  USA Today how much will Alex Jones pay trial begins up for judge ruled he defamed Sandy Hook parents, so USA Today
[34:36.980 --> 34:43.860]  Actually tells you but 99% of the articles and there's thousands thousands a day
[34:45.060 --> 34:49.780]  This is more propaganda than before they falsely invented Iraq the first or second time
[34:50.580 --> 34:53.860]  Because they see me as the American people. I'm not that important
[34:53.860 --> 34:59.500]  But they see my spirit the spirit of this broadcast your spirit as their main enemy it enrages them
[35:01.060 --> 35:04.540]  Thousands of articles every TV station in the country mainline
[35:04.540 --> 35:10.300]  Keep me just like the Twitter feed just type it on the shows hundreds of thousands of things that they just like I say thousands
[35:10.300 --> 35:12.300]  I mean, it's just
[35:12.900 --> 35:20.620]  Because it's panic button stop the people stop the Midwest stop the conservatives stop the South stop the blacks waking up stop
[35:20.620 --> 35:23.220]  This man's ringing up stop them stop them stop them
[35:24.620 --> 35:26.980]  It's almost all the articles are Jones
[35:27.900 --> 35:33.860]  Faces a jury trial. No, no, no, no Jones is in a rigged system with a corrupt Soros judge
[35:33.860 --> 35:37.100]  That said we were guilty same thing in Connecticut coming up the month and
[35:39.260 --> 35:44.820]  Jones is in a rigged situation he came to defend himself, but it'll be arrested if he doesn't show up to it the judges said
[35:46.060 --> 35:51.020]  So how much will Alex Jones pay trial begins up for judge ruled he defamed Sandy Hook parents
[35:51.820 --> 35:55.940]  Now they already ordered our financials a year ago, so they know I don't have any money
[35:55.980 --> 35:59.380]  That's why she's doing million-dollar fines and stuff, but they're gonna tell the jury
[35:59.380 --> 36:06.340]  I've got hundreds of millions of dollars. They hope he's just shut this operation down, but as long as we stay on air as long as we continue on
[36:07.340 --> 36:09.220]  It'll just make us bigger
[36:09.220 --> 36:15.780]  But that's what these people are doing. There's another one. Oh AP jury selection starts for Alex Jones defamation trial
[36:15.780 --> 36:25.300]  It's not a defamation trial. I was already found guilty the jury doesn't get to pick that the judge tells them how guilty so AP involved in the yellowest
[36:25.300 --> 36:28.820]  Pissback form of journalism. There is and
[36:31.220 --> 36:34.420]  It just goes on from there Robert Barnes covered the trial today
[36:34.420 --> 36:40.580]  He says want to know how bias the Alex Jones jury pool in Austin is not a single juror throughout the media
[36:40.820 --> 36:47.940]  Has ever treated Jones not a single juror thought this is a question to ask the media had ever treated Jones rim for some fairly
[36:48.460 --> 36:53.340]  Or incorrectly ever. This is the same media caught literally libeling Jones
[36:53.340 --> 36:55.260]  A
[36:55.260 --> 36:57.260]  Half dozen times in this case
[36:58.380 --> 37:02.300]  Plain of lawyers throughout the number. They want the jury of a 100 million
[37:02.620 --> 37:08.460]  That's like saying you're gonna be shot 10 times or 500 times. I mean don't have a million dollars. So that's why it's so funny
[37:09.500 --> 37:15.740]  Because we'll continue on will be on air one way or the other and they're not gonna get any money because there is no money
[37:15.740 --> 37:17.900]  But they don't they already know that folks
[37:19.700 --> 37:21.700]  So here's what's going on
[37:21.700 --> 37:24.820]  I'm not gonna give away our whole battle plan
[37:25.940 --> 37:32.300]  And I'm not gonna sit here and tell our enemies what next moves we're gonna make but let's just explain this real simply, okay
[37:33.540 --> 37:35.940]  They messed around and threatened the wrong people and
[37:39.940 --> 37:43.380]  I've already passed the test that I'm not gonna back down and
[37:43.380 --> 37:50.980]  There's a lot of big people on the bench who are on the edge of getting off the bench and this is gonna take them off the bench
[37:51.540 --> 37:55.780]  Now I got a great crew we need to keep employed and this incarnation of enforcers is important
[37:55.780 --> 37:59.300]  I love it, but like a grandparent that's gonna die sometimes that happens
[37:59.740 --> 38:03.300]  The point is out of this the Phoenix will rise
[38:04.380 --> 38:07.300]  But to complete our future operations
[38:08.300 --> 38:10.300]  Because of internal sabotage
[38:10.300 --> 38:13.060]  Other things I've learned of is we're up against intelligence agencies
[38:13.780 --> 38:17.740]  We have a bind in funding and thank God
[38:17.740 --> 38:21.900]  It's like whoever gave us the big donations knew exactly how far behind we were
[38:21.900 --> 38:28.100]  I didn't even know it we had outside accounting firms come in so God working Holy Spirit, whatever it was it happened
[38:28.540 --> 38:31.820]  Well now it's very simple if we just get a
[38:32.900 --> 38:38.780]  Million extra dollars in the next couple months because we've got this trial the next trial any basic
[38:38.780 --> 38:41.180]  Offense will tell you cost a million bucks in a big trial
[38:41.260 --> 38:45.420]  So we've got the money for the Austin trial but not the money for the Connecticut trial
[38:45.420 --> 38:51.900]  And I'm trying to budget stuff out everything else if you'll just buy the book that everybody wants to get if you will just simply
[38:52.140 --> 39:00.060]  Support the broadcast if if if folks will simply just spread the word. We're gonna win big time, but we are in a pinch
[39:01.580 --> 39:03.580]  Everybody should go to info or store.com
[39:03.580 --> 39:10.700]  And get the great reset that ships out in late August being printed right now right here in America and the war for the world
[39:10.700 --> 39:17.460]  This is the great reset book that gives all their quotes all their battle plans and how to stop them and even Steve Bannon
[39:17.460 --> 39:19.940]  Right and he said my god, this blows away all the other books on this
[39:19.940 --> 39:24.980]  I just how the hell do you write this? Well, we just call the research together integrated and put it out
[39:24.980 --> 39:26.820]  It's all the Holy Spirit
[39:26.820 --> 39:31.260]  The great reset. It's simple go to info or store.com right now and
[39:31.260 --> 39:34.700]  And order the book want to sign copy order that that's a fundraiser
[39:34.700 --> 39:36.420]  It all shows us right t-shirt
[39:36.420 --> 39:44.300]  But get the great reset now and have this historical document to show others the battle plan the globalists have to attack you and your family
[39:44.380 --> 39:48.020]  Yeah, the sign copy and I'm gonna sign every damn one of them is a fundraiser
[39:48.020 --> 39:53.500]  It's a lot of money to fight a war the other book is less than half the cost of that unsigned. That's also available
[39:54.260 --> 39:58.940]  At info or store.com, but it takes money to fight a war and I'll leave it on the field
[39:58.940 --> 40:05.420]  I'm gonna go 110% to the end whatever happens, but I know our greatest work is still to come and I don't give it to these targets, so
[40:06.460 --> 40:10.380]  Go now don't wait if you're watching or you're listening or however you see this

[47:41.420 --> 47:47.060]  Perceivable future as long as he's gonna be in court every day dealing with the stuff, but tomorrow
[47:48.180 --> 47:50.180]  I'm gonna be in court as well
[47:50.180 --> 47:57.300]  And so Bob Barnes is going to be hosting the Alex Jones show. We'll also have Christy Lee hosting the war room
[47:57.300 --> 48:02.860]  But that's the time we're in that that is the part of the info war we're in right now
[48:03.020 --> 48:05.780]  Where Alex Jones and myself are constantly in and out of court
[48:05.780 --> 48:08.820]  And I think this is like the four to third or fourth time this year now
[48:08.820 --> 48:14.580]  Where both of us have been unable to be on air cuz we're in court, but that's just the programming note for you right there
[48:15.700 --> 48:19.220]  So that you know what's coming up tomorrow now. I have a
[48:20.100 --> 48:23.180]  desk full of the latest breaking news and
[48:23.820 --> 48:31.220]  I'm gonna be on air with you till 6 p.m. Central tonight trying to cover all of it as well as about 20 video clips
[48:31.220 --> 48:35.660]  I think I'll be able to get through all of it and have time for some phone calls
[48:35.660 --> 48:41.780]  But let's pick back up from the big story yesterday
[48:42.580 --> 48:44.580]  Which is the Biden administration?
[48:46.020 --> 48:51.100]  Which is just floundering like a fish out of water on a deck
[48:51.900 --> 48:53.900]  flopping and floundering about
[48:55.180 --> 48:57.300]  heaving for air or water rather
[48:59.420 --> 49:01.420]  Where Biden is out with COVID
[49:01.420 --> 49:08.580]  Nobody has access to Biden or cancer. I guess we don't know nobody has access to Biden his doctor is
[49:09.180 --> 49:11.180]  MIA and
[49:11.740 --> 49:13.740]  actual leftists and
[49:14.260 --> 49:18.860]  Liberal journalists and Democrats are saying hey, we have no access to Biden or his doctor. What's going on?
[49:19.740 --> 49:26.660]  We have to ask Jean Pierre questions. Hey, look, she's great. She's gay. She's an immigrant. She's black and everything, but she's also an idiot
[49:27.380 --> 49:29.380]  So where do we go for answers here?
[49:29.380 --> 49:35.580]  So they rewrite the definition of recession. Everybody knows it's a recession. It's always been understood
[49:36.460 --> 49:38.900]  two quarters in a row of
[49:42.700 --> 49:44.700]  GDP growth shrinking and
[49:46.300 --> 49:49.100]  I think the number they're expecting is like 2.2 percent
[49:49.700 --> 49:52.540]  Maybe like 2.5 to 2.2 or something
[49:52.540 --> 49:59.700]  The point is it's it's always been when you have two quarters in a row of your GDP number going down
[50:00.700 --> 50:02.700]  That's the beginning of a recession
[50:04.020 --> 50:06.020]  It's always been understood that way
[50:06.580 --> 50:08.740]  It will always be understood that way
[50:09.460 --> 50:12.580]  But because this administration is so desperate
[50:13.940 --> 50:16.300]  For any sort of a positive headline
[50:16.300 --> 50:22.380]  They can't let the inflation and the recession story
[50:22.900 --> 50:27.780]  Dominate heading into the midterms even though it's the number one issue for most American voters
[50:28.380 --> 50:30.380]  So they have to lie about it
[50:30.420 --> 50:33.620]  They have to rewrite definitions and then they have
[50:34.420 --> 50:40.620]  The one IQ press secretary the only one even available to take questions on this
[50:41.500 --> 50:43.500]  from members of the media
[50:43.500 --> 50:49.540]  Though they may be liberal Democrats are much smarter than her and know that they're being
[50:50.620 --> 50:52.620]  Basically treated like goons
[50:52.740 --> 50:58.700]  With this with this clown up there as the press secretary Biden MIA Biden's doctor MIA and
[50:59.980 --> 51:03.100]  Then you have the Biden cabinet which is losing members
[51:04.260 --> 51:06.860]  Left and right losing staff left and right
[51:07.780 --> 51:09.780]  It's a clown show. It's a disaster
[51:09.780 --> 51:12.780]  So they say boy, oh boy
[51:13.820 --> 51:16.540]  We can't have people know we're in a recession
[51:16.740 --> 51:21.060]  What happened when Obama got into office in 2008?
[51:21.900 --> 51:26.540]  Immediately we went into a recession and that recession continued throughout his presidency
[51:27.060 --> 51:33.140]  Soon as Trump got back or soon as Trump got into the White House things turned around GDP started going up immediately
[51:33.140 --> 51:41.260]  Immediately now Biden is in and it sinks down again boy. If that's not the proof Obama is running the White House
[51:41.260 --> 51:43.060]  I don't know what is
[51:43.060 --> 51:44.660]  but rather
[51:44.660 --> 51:48.660]  It's the proof that the policies implemented by Democrats
[51:49.420 --> 51:53.660]  lead to a recession and of course it doesn't spy design
[51:55.180 --> 51:58.700]  The entire philosophy is that America's too powerful
[51:59.780 --> 52:01.780]  America's too prosperous and
[52:01.780 --> 52:07.540]  Now they have their propaganda campaign of man-made climate change to pepper on top of it and say
[52:08.860 --> 52:15.820]  Not only do we just consider it bad for marriage America to exist now you're killing the planet by existing
[52:16.860 --> 52:22.820]  So oh really you want to shrink America down to a pebble of course the GDP is going to go down
[52:22.820 --> 52:24.820]  Of course, you're going to be in a recession
[52:26.900 --> 52:28.900]  So
[52:29.140 --> 52:31.140]  It's not working
[52:31.140 --> 52:35.460]  The media knows though. They're in the tank for Biden that it's a recession
[52:36.180 --> 52:38.860]  Everybody knows that there's dramatic inflation
[52:39.420 --> 52:43.820]  The average consumer is getting hit now with the increases in the consumer price index
[52:43.820 --> 52:48.260]  The producers are all getting record producer price index increases as well
[52:49.700 --> 52:52.200]  But imagine imagine I
[52:53.580 --> 52:58.340]  Don't even know what the word is. I mean ludicrous just outright lying
[52:58.340 --> 53:01.620]  Shameful or shameless rather
[53:03.780 --> 53:07.660]  Gas prices are still at record highs in this country
[53:09.020 --> 53:17.140]  Gas prices on average are still at record highs in this country and the Biden administration has the nerve to send out
[53:18.060 --> 53:19.580]  tweets and
[53:19.580 --> 53:28.300]  To send out press releases and to have the press secretary go out and say we're saving you money on gas. We
[53:28.460 --> 53:32.420]  Have lowered the gas prices. They're still at record highs
[53:34.340 --> 53:38.260]  They were so off the charts
[53:40.340 --> 53:46.020]  As far as the the high prices were concerned that yeah, they lowered them a little bit still at a record high
[53:46.020 --> 53:53.260]  The gas prices are still at a record high and the Biden administration is bragging about it
[53:55.540 --> 54:02.780]  Joe Biden brags about gas prices that are the highest in US history is the perfect headline at the Gateway Pundit
[54:04.540 --> 54:09.380]  And then when Jean Pierre is asked about all this stuff. She just she doesn't know anything. I don't know
[54:09.380 --> 54:12.460]  Let me look at me. I'm just a I'm just a woman up here in a clown wig
[54:12.460 --> 54:15.660]  I'm not going to define it from here
[54:16.180 --> 54:18.180]  Kareem Jean Pierre when asked what is
[54:19.020 --> 54:23.780]  The White House's definition of recession. Well, you know, we don't know we're changing it every day
[54:23.780 --> 54:28.620]  You know, it depends what the numbers we get are then we'll decide what a recession is
[54:28.620 --> 54:38.940]  But it's not even really fair to call it a recession. It's sabotage. It's siege
[54:42.180 --> 54:48.700]  So oh gas prices hit a record high, what does the Biden administration say we have no control over the gas prices
[54:48.780 --> 54:52.900]  It's the big oil companies. It's Vladimir Putin. There's nothing we can do and
[54:52.900 --> 54:59.580]  And then gas prices go down just a tiny little fraction a couple pennies and all of a sudden look at what we've done
[54:59.660 --> 55:04.540]  We've saved you so much money. Look at how great we are. We lowered the gas prices
[55:04.780 --> 55:09.100]  First of all, they're still at a record high second of all last week. He told me you had no control over the gas prices
[55:09.100 --> 55:10.700]  So what's exactly?
[55:10.700 --> 55:12.700]  the story there
[55:12.700 --> 55:20.900]  You want to know how bad it is in the Biden administration folks, do you want to know how bad it really is?
[55:22.900 --> 55:26.740]  Jill Biden's press secretary to leave White House
[55:27.900 --> 55:36.380]  Jill Biden's press secretary to leave White House. There's one obvious question here and then then the second follow-up question
[55:37.700 --> 55:40.340]  Why does Jill Biden have a press secretary?
[55:40.340 --> 55:45.460]  Have you ever heard of Michael LaRosa? Probably not. But he gets a nice government contract though. I
[55:46.220 --> 55:48.220]  Bet he has a nice
[55:48.220 --> 55:49.740]  nice government
[55:49.740 --> 55:51.740]  tax payer funded
[55:51.740 --> 55:53.740]  salary
[55:54.220 --> 55:55.740]  So
[55:55.740 --> 56:01.900]  Why does Jill Biden have a press secretary is the obvious question and then the follow-up would be
[56:04.140 --> 56:06.140]  So
[56:06.140 --> 56:08.500]  This guy quit the job
[56:08.500 --> 56:10.500]  That doesn't even exist
[56:12.380 --> 56:15.380]  Things are so bad in the Biden White House
[56:15.980 --> 56:17.980]  That this guy quits the job
[56:18.620 --> 56:20.620]  That doesn't even exist
[56:21.020 --> 56:23.820]  It's the job where you show up to work and do nothing
[56:24.420 --> 56:27.180]  It's the job where you sit around and you get a paycheck
[56:27.820 --> 56:29.820]  And he quit
[56:29.820 --> 56:33.740]  That's how bad it is. He doesn't even want free money
[56:33.740 --> 56:36.740]  He doesn't even want free money
[56:37.500 --> 56:43.460]  He doesn't even want free money to be associated with this clown show
[56:44.980 --> 56:52.340]  Jill Biden's press secretary to leave White House. I didn't even know you were here. When did you even get here?
[56:53.180 --> 56:55.180]  Who hired you?
[56:55.980 --> 56:57.980]  You were collecting a paycheck
[56:57.980 --> 57:02.980]  Jill Biden's press secretary. Oh

[1:00:16.740 --> 1:00:18.740]  on cnn
[1:00:18.900 --> 1:00:22.420]  Last night that we all knew was the case
[1:00:23.860 --> 1:00:28.100]  Now they're just admitting it because things are coming off the rails so bad
[1:00:28.100 --> 1:00:32.820]  With the leftist liberal ideology and the biden administration policies
[1:00:33.860 --> 1:00:37.940]  That they just can't hide it or rather they can't fake it anymore
[1:00:38.740 --> 1:00:40.340]  so here's
[1:00:40.340 --> 1:00:42.340]  Cassie hunt on cnn
[1:00:43.220 --> 1:00:49.220]  Telling the ultimate by accident. You notice how liberals are doing this now. They're telling the truth by accident because it's just I mean eventually
[1:00:50.020 --> 1:00:55.140]  When you have such conflicting ideologies and such conflicting
[1:00:55.140 --> 1:01:04.420]  Rationals, yeah, eventually you're gonna tell the truth by accident. So you're seeing that more often now. So here's the ultimate truth by accident
[1:01:04.820 --> 1:01:11.140]  By cnn's cassie hunt yesterday saying guys, we can't fake it anymore
[1:01:12.100 --> 1:01:13.060]  panel
[1:01:13.060 --> 1:01:14.420]  Chris eliza
[1:01:14.420 --> 1:01:17.620]  inflation affects every american directly
[1:01:18.260 --> 1:01:22.980]  The biden administration is trying to point out the diff the definition of a recession is nuanced
[1:01:22.980 --> 1:01:25.540]  But I gotta tell you I I struggle with this
[1:01:25.540 --> 1:01:27.540]  I get that why they want to do it from a political perspective
[1:01:27.540 --> 1:01:33.940]  But like you can't fake this. No, I was just I was laughing myself in my view. There you go. Caitlyn highlight. You can't fake this

[1:01:50.500 --> 1:01:52.500]  Why does she say that?
[1:01:53.860 --> 1:01:58.580]  Why does she say we can't fake this because they fake everything else?
[1:01:59.780 --> 1:02:01.780]  They fake everything else
[1:02:02.580 --> 1:02:04.740]  She just admitted the big secret
[1:02:06.740 --> 1:02:09.940]  She just accidentally let the cat out of the bag
[1:02:11.060 --> 1:02:17.460]  We can't fake this one guys. I know we fake everything else. I know we fake russian collusion
[1:02:18.100 --> 1:02:20.100]  I know we fake
[1:02:20.100 --> 1:02:22.100]  Biden 81 million votes
[1:02:22.740 --> 1:02:24.740]  I know we fake climate change
[1:02:25.780 --> 1:02:27.780]  I know we fake
[1:02:28.420 --> 1:02:33.060]  Uh gay pride month as perversion and sexualizing children
[1:02:34.020 --> 1:02:39.620]  Or rather we disguise perverting children as gay pride month. I know we fake it all guys
[1:02:39.940 --> 1:02:42.820]  I know everything we do is fake. I know it
[1:02:43.460 --> 1:02:45.460]  And I know a lot of the time it works
[1:02:45.460 --> 1:02:48.500]  But we can't fake this
[1:02:51.540 --> 1:02:56.260]  Oh, but that's not going to stop them from trying. I'm sorry. I'm sorry
[1:02:57.700 --> 1:02:59.700]  Cassie hunt on cnn
[1:02:59.860 --> 1:03:05.140]  The binded administration is going to try to fake this and you're going to go along with it
[1:03:06.580 --> 1:03:09.060]  You will go along with it because that's your job
[1:03:09.780 --> 1:03:11.780]  You're paid to fake it
[1:03:11.780 --> 1:03:17.860]  Let's get that one more time guys. So so now that we have the context the understanding the breakdown
[1:03:19.060 --> 1:03:22.580]  They fake everything jesse smallutt bubble wallace
[1:03:23.620 --> 1:03:26.100]  hunter biden laptop russian disinformation
[1:03:26.980 --> 1:03:28.740]  Putin price hike
[1:03:28.740 --> 1:03:31.140]  They fake everything
[1:03:31.780 --> 1:03:36.420]  And they get away with it, but this recession thing it hits every americans. So it's like yeah, we
[1:03:36.420 --> 1:03:41.540]  So, I mean, that's what she's saying. Hey gas prices are still a record high
[1:03:42.100 --> 1:03:45.700]  Maybe you shouldn't tell people that you're saving them money on gas
[1:03:46.340 --> 1:03:48.340]  Gas prices are still record high
[1:03:48.660 --> 1:03:53.300]  Maybe you shouldn't be bragging about lowering gas prices when they're still record high or in other words
[1:03:53.300 --> 1:03:57.380]  I know we fake everything else, but this one is a little too obvious to fake
[1:03:57.540 --> 1:03:59.940]  Let's hear it again from the cnn host panel
[1:04:00.580 --> 1:04:01.940]  chrysaliza
[1:04:01.940 --> 1:04:09.700]  Inflation affects every american directly. Uh, the by administration is trying to point out the diff the definition of a recession is
[1:04:09.860 --> 1:04:15.060]  Nuanced, but I gotta tell you I I struggle with this. I get that why they want to do it from a political perspective
[1:04:15.060 --> 1:04:21.140]  But like you can't fake this. No, I can't fake this. There it is again. I know we faked a pandemic and it worked
[1:04:22.260 --> 1:04:28.420]  I know we faked and lied about the border patrol agents using whips and tried to ruin their lives and that was fake
[1:04:28.420 --> 1:04:35.380]  I know we fake hate crimes. I know we fake pandemics. I know we fake elections. I know we fake news
[1:04:36.020 --> 1:04:42.580]  I know that everything we do is fake and most people fall for it. I know but this one we can't fake guys
[1:04:43.620 --> 1:04:45.940]  This one we just can't fake
[1:04:47.300 --> 1:04:48.900]  Well, it's nice
[1:04:48.900 --> 1:04:50.900]  for cassie hunt at least to be
[1:04:50.900 --> 1:04:58.260]  Accidentally telling the truth on cnn for once admitting that they fake everything
[1:04:58.660 --> 1:05:02.260]  The globalist great reset or the war for the world is here
[1:05:02.420 --> 1:05:07.860]  But humanity is not being caught flat footed because of info wars and because of your support
[1:05:08.500 --> 1:05:13.860]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is now more important than ever as we reach the critical heart of the battle

[1:06:15.460 --> 1:06:35.220]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are at a historic epic paramount moment in the info war and the battle for the human soul
[1:06:37.460 --> 1:06:42.020]  And it truly was the best of times and the worst of times
[1:06:42.020 --> 1:06:47.700]  And as info wars and alex jones are going through our own trials right now
[1:06:48.340 --> 1:06:50.740]  We're also going through our own tribulations
[1:06:52.020 --> 1:06:57.060]  Now this is amazing folks because part of the problem around here, you know
[1:06:58.020 --> 1:07:02.020]  Info wars has been so successful and so influential that our enemies look at us
[1:07:02.900 --> 1:07:05.780]  And they think we're some sort of like masterminds
[1:07:06.420 --> 1:07:08.420]  master craftsmen
[1:07:08.740 --> 1:07:09.860]  uh
[1:07:09.860 --> 1:07:15.060]  In order to have the the influence and success that we've had here and they don't understand we're just like berserkers
[1:07:15.780 --> 1:07:23.300]  We're just like raging maniac berserkers. Just like frothing at the mouth and a war and somebody just gives us like a
[1:07:23.940 --> 1:07:27.140]  A canon or something and just says get out there. We're like, yeah, let's go on
[1:07:29.060 --> 1:07:31.060]  I mean you've seen alex over the years
[1:07:32.580 --> 1:07:33.620]  So
[1:07:33.620 --> 1:07:40.500]  Part of our problem here is that we're just such a we're just such a berserker mentality in the info war that we
[1:07:40.820 --> 1:07:43.460]  We really don't scheme or mastermind anything
[1:07:44.260 --> 1:07:46.260]  So I mean it's like by the grace of god
[1:07:46.740 --> 1:07:48.980]  And and this audience and the support and the prayers
[1:07:50.260 --> 1:07:52.260]  But it's really speaking truth to power
[1:07:52.580 --> 1:07:54.580]  But what am I talking about so
[1:07:55.860 --> 1:07:57.860]  Alex jones has a brand new book out
[1:07:59.060 --> 1:08:01.060]  now
[1:08:01.140 --> 1:08:03.140]  We've been so busy
[1:08:03.140 --> 1:08:06.340]  And such berserkers in the info war. We didn't even promote it
[1:08:08.100 --> 1:08:11.460]  Like I mean that's something like that's a major failure. We planned the book
[1:08:11.540 --> 1:08:16.900]  He wrote the book the book is ready to go and it's like we just totally forgot like oh, we forgot to promote it
[1:08:16.980 --> 1:08:20.020]  Oh, yeah, this huge project oops slipped through the cracks
[1:08:21.140 --> 1:08:23.140]  Because we're just like, you know
[1:08:23.620 --> 1:08:25.620]  the fog of war
[1:08:25.700 --> 1:08:27.940]  The blood dripping over your eyes analogy
[1:08:27.940 --> 1:08:32.180]  But here's what's incredible about it
[1:08:34.100 --> 1:08:42.180]  As soon as the book goes live on amazon it immediately tops the charts in multiple
[1:08:43.220 --> 1:08:45.220]  Categories and and again. Nope
[1:08:46.180 --> 1:08:51.700]  We didn't promote it. We didn't that's the thing like they oh, how does info wars do all this the masterminds and the marketing and
[1:08:51.700 --> 1:08:58.420]  Uh, no, we're actually kind of a joke when it comes to that to be honest with you. Yeah, we're so good on air with our
[1:08:58.500 --> 1:09:04.660]  Information and with our crew being so quick to the to the task that yeah, that that's the best
[1:09:04.900 --> 1:09:10.420]  That's the best out there, but as far as like marketing and scheming and that guys up. We're like we're a joke, man
[1:09:11.300 --> 1:09:13.140]  It's actually sad
[1:09:13.140 --> 1:09:17.460]  But that's fine. We're not in it for money or anything like that. So okay, these things happen
[1:09:17.460 --> 1:09:21.460]  So the great reset and the war for the world
[1:09:22.580 --> 1:09:24.580]  The latest book by alex jones
[1:09:25.140 --> 1:09:27.940]  Of course, you can get it at info wars store.com
[1:09:29.300 --> 1:09:34.340]  It is on sale there. That's probably it might be the cheapest you can get it is at info wars store.com, but
[1:09:35.540 --> 1:09:39.300]  If you want to get into the book wars on amazon
[1:09:40.260 --> 1:09:42.420]  We don't like promoting it there because
[1:09:43.380 --> 1:09:45.380]  Well, obviously they're going to get their cut
[1:09:45.380 --> 1:09:51.620]  But as part of the culture war, perhaps we do promote it on amazon because
[1:09:52.580 --> 1:09:57.780]  It was already in the top 100 books worldwide on amazon's website
[1:09:58.500 --> 1:10:03.380]  Uh, as soon as it was released and then it hit a number one bestseller category in multiple
[1:10:04.820 --> 1:10:08.820]  In multiple subsections like movers and shakers
[1:10:09.460 --> 1:10:11.460]  Or anti fascism
[1:10:11.780 --> 1:10:14.260]  Yeah, actually alex jones is anti fascist
[1:10:14.260 --> 1:10:16.260]  Yeah
[1:10:16.420 --> 1:10:20.820]  And I believe it's now actually like 76 overall in in their entire
[1:10:21.540 --> 1:10:25.300]  Um book section on amazon in the whole world
[1:10:26.340 --> 1:10:30.820]  So you can get it info wars store.com the great reset and the war for the world by alex jones
[1:10:30.900 --> 1:10:36.020]  Or if you want to take part in the culture wars on amazon, you can go purchase it on amazon
[1:10:37.300 --> 1:10:39.300]  Um, whatever it's up to you
[1:10:39.300 --> 1:10:46.900]  But that is amazing. That is a huge victory for us. That is a huge victory for truth. That is a huge victory for this audience
[1:10:48.020 --> 1:10:50.740]  And I mean just think about it
[1:10:51.620 --> 1:10:57.540]  In the last week and it's less than that, but we'll say in the last week
[1:10:58.260 --> 1:11:02.260]  alex jones has had the number one trending
[1:11:03.220 --> 1:11:05.220]  Pre-order movie
[1:11:05.220 --> 1:11:09.860]  Actually the only movie that was beating it at the one time was was the new top gun
[1:11:10.580 --> 1:11:11.940]  So imagine that
[1:11:11.940 --> 1:11:15.620]  Top gun and then alex jones and now you have the alex jones book
[1:11:16.500 --> 1:11:18.500]  topping the charts as well
[1:11:19.780 --> 1:11:25.140]  Now here's why you celebrate that here's why we celebrate that they want folks. They've wanted us off air
[1:11:25.220 --> 1:11:30.500]  They've wanted us done in jail dead no influence and yet here we are
[1:11:30.500 --> 1:11:37.860]  In a situation where they're trying to end the company. I'll leave it at that. I think you know what's going on
[1:11:38.500 --> 1:11:41.220]  And yet we're still number one
[1:11:43.300 --> 1:11:49.380]  You see you see why they want alex jones off air you see why they want info or shut down
[1:11:54.100 --> 1:11:59.060]  Because they can't have the evidence that their ideas are unpopular
[1:11:59.060 --> 1:12:05.700]  And that standing against the globalist ideas standing against the liberal left fascism
[1:12:06.340 --> 1:12:09.620]  They can't have the evidence out there that that's what people want
[1:12:10.420 --> 1:12:16.820]  Have to remove info wars remove alex jones from the marketplace because it's the total evidence
[1:12:17.460 --> 1:12:23.300]  That no matter what you say about alex jones no matter what you print no matter what you put on tv no matter what you do
[1:12:24.020 --> 1:12:26.020]  still number one
[1:12:26.020 --> 1:12:30.020]  And they can't stand it
[1:12:31.140 --> 1:12:33.140]  So there you go though you can get the new book
[1:12:33.540 --> 1:12:35.540]  The great reset and the war for the world
[1:12:36.180 --> 1:12:37.940]  by alex jones
[1:12:37.940 --> 1:12:40.580]  Now let's get back to the news here
[1:12:45.060 --> 1:12:50.340]  This is how bad it's getting in biden's america. This is a virginia food bank
[1:12:51.380 --> 1:12:53.380]  And just a quick clip from nbc
[1:12:53.380 --> 1:13:00.020]  Speaking to families at the food bank in virginia, which is so overwhelmed folks that they they
[1:13:00.580 --> 1:13:04.020]  They're going out of food and just at just hours every day
[1:13:05.700 --> 1:13:12.020]  In loudon county virginia so many families are asking for help they ran out of food after 90 minutes today
[1:13:12.420 --> 1:13:19.540]  We are seeing 20 to 25 new families each week that are coming in that are new to us that have never gotten our services before
[1:13:19.540 --> 1:13:23.940]  Now I actually worked at a food bank one summer
[1:13:24.900 --> 1:13:26.900]  for the entire summer
[1:13:27.220 --> 1:13:28.420]  and
[1:13:28.420 --> 1:13:30.420]  They were never out of food
[1:13:30.980 --> 1:13:32.980]  And this was in kind of a you know
[1:13:33.620 --> 1:13:38.260]  Impoverished area of st. Louis. I mean people were coming all the time people were donating all the time
[1:13:38.340 --> 1:13:40.340]  But we always had food on the shelves
[1:13:40.740 --> 1:13:45.380]  It was never a situation where if somebody came in looking for food whether they had a scheduled visit or not
[1:13:46.020 --> 1:13:48.020]  We always had food for people
[1:13:48.020 --> 1:13:51.380]  Well, that's that seems to be going away now doesn't it?
[1:13:53.700 --> 1:13:59.300]  And and and you know, it's just so frustrating understanding why this is happening and that it's by design
[1:14:00.020 --> 1:14:03.860]  Really, they're going to shut off the energy. They're going to shut off the gas. They're going to shut off coal
[1:14:04.900 --> 1:14:06.900]  What do you think is going to happen? That's the
[1:14:07.540 --> 1:14:10.900]  That's like the blood of the body of our economy
[1:14:10.900 --> 1:14:16.740]  And they're taking the blood out of it. What happens if you remove the blood from the human body? Well, the body dies
[1:14:19.540 --> 1:14:21.540]  And so that's what they're doing to us now
[1:14:22.980 --> 1:14:26.820]  And slowly but surely it just gets worse
[1:14:27.620 --> 1:14:29.380]  and worse
[1:14:29.380 --> 1:14:31.380]  and worse
[1:14:31.380 --> 1:14:37.220]  And worse until you wake up one day and you realize you have just been totally priced out
[1:14:37.220 --> 1:14:45.620]  Of what used to be the ease of access marketplace filling your gas tank running your ac all day running your heat all day
[1:14:46.500 --> 1:14:52.980]  Driving whenever you want to drive or need to drive somewhere going to the grocery store and getting your grocery list completed
[1:14:54.660 --> 1:14:59.860]  Slowly but surely that's just being chipped away at chipped away at chipped away at
[1:15:00.580 --> 1:15:02.580]  And they campaign
[1:15:02.900 --> 1:15:04.900]  And they promise that's what they're going to do
[1:15:04.900 --> 1:15:13.060]  But they disguise it because they don't be they're not fully honest. They say oh, we're doing this to fight man-made climate change
[1:15:13.380 --> 1:15:17.700]  So then you feel good about it. You're saying oh, I'm fighting man-made climate change
[1:15:18.020 --> 1:15:20.020]  You don't realize that you're actually being
[1:15:20.580 --> 1:15:22.580]  extincted
[1:15:22.580 --> 1:15:25.540]  Elk Grove food bank may need to start buying food
[1:15:26.660 --> 1:15:30.020]  So the crew is just pulling up all these different stories now about food banks
[1:15:30.020 --> 1:15:35.780]  Running out of food. I'm telling you I worked a whole summer out of food bank. Never were even close to being out of food folks
[1:15:37.220 --> 1:15:39.220]  Never
[1:15:39.940 --> 1:15:41.940]  But they lied to you and they told you
[1:15:42.740 --> 1:15:47.780]  Hey, we're just stopping man-made climate change, which doesn't even exist the way they're saying it does
[1:15:48.740 --> 1:15:51.780]  Really what they were telling you is hey, we're just stopping man
[1:15:52.900 --> 1:15:56.900]  We're instinct. We're extincting man and we're we're moving on

[1:19:55.380 --> 1:20:11.780]  All right, let's take a look at this stack of political news that I have in front of me here
[1:20:11.940 --> 1:20:15.940]  What are our dirt and dirt problems?
[1:20:15.940 --> 1:20:25.940]  What are our dirt bag politicians up to?
[1:20:25.940 --> 1:20:32.420]  Senate Democrats to introduce bill targeting illegal machine guns
[1:20:33.300 --> 1:20:38.180]  And this is actually in response to a bill that Thomas Massie proposed to protect
[1:20:38.980 --> 1:20:40.980]  gun modifications
[1:20:41.140 --> 1:20:43.140]  It got struck down. It got voted down
[1:20:43.140 --> 1:20:45.140]  By every Democrat and a couple Republicans
[1:20:45.140 --> 1:20:51.140]  Thomas Massie the good guy in Congress trying to protect our freedoms
[1:20:51.140 --> 1:20:57.140]  And now Democrats have introduced the new bill. It's not about targeting illegal machine guns folks
[1:20:57.140 --> 1:21:01.140]  I guess that's how the media is reporting it
[1:21:01.140 --> 1:21:05.140]  This is the vice headline
[1:21:05.140 --> 1:21:11.140]  They're trying to make it illegal to do any modifications to your gun
[1:21:11.140 --> 1:21:13.140]  That's what it is
[1:21:13.140 --> 1:21:19.140]  They're making a bill making it illegal to do any modifications to your gun whatsoever
[1:21:19.140 --> 1:21:23.140]  And then they just say well we're just blocking machine guns and then you read into it
[1:21:23.140 --> 1:21:27.140]  And it's just any modification they say is illegal
[1:21:27.140 --> 1:21:31.140]  I mean it's just nuts. So I mean I see what the Democrats are doing
[1:21:31.140 --> 1:21:35.140]  Most people see what the Democrats are doing as far as the proposed gun legislation
[1:21:35.140 --> 1:21:39.140]  They're trying to nitpick with these bills
[1:21:39.140 --> 1:21:47.140]  That have very nuanced specific features of they're saying this is illegal like a size
[1:21:47.140 --> 1:21:51.140]  A certain size magazine or this is illegal with a certain modification
[1:21:51.140 --> 1:21:55.140]  Or this is illegal with a barrel a certain length or what have you
[1:21:55.140 --> 1:21:59.140]  And then you realize oh well they just made like half the guns illegal
[1:21:59.140 --> 1:22:03.140]  But see they didn't have to actually make any of the guns illegal if they just make one part illegal
[1:22:03.140 --> 1:22:07.140]  And this part illegal or this modification illegal or this length or that length
[1:22:07.140 --> 1:22:11.140]  And then it's just oh half the guns are now illegal
[1:22:11.140 --> 1:22:15.140]  But of course that's illegal
[1:22:15.140 --> 1:22:19.140]  What they're doing is illegal they want you disarmed they want you dead
[1:22:19.140 --> 1:22:21.140]  They want you to be a victim
[1:22:21.140 --> 1:22:25.140]  They see a mass shooting and they celebrate
[1:22:25.140 --> 1:22:29.140]  Because they get to dance on the graves of those victims and cry gun control
[1:22:29.140 --> 1:22:33.140]  Disarm the people let's have a bunch of slaves
[1:22:33.140 --> 1:22:37.140]  Because slaves aren't allowed firearms you know right
[1:22:37.140 --> 1:22:41.140]  You get that
[1:22:41.140 --> 1:22:45.140]  And then you see oh look this woman stopped a mass shooting probably saved dozens of lives
[1:22:45.140 --> 1:22:49.140]  At a graduation a good person with a gun they don't care
[1:22:49.140 --> 1:22:53.140]  Oh look Indiana Mall this this this psychotic killer
[1:22:53.140 --> 1:22:57.140]  Probably would have killed 20 30 40 people in a mall good guy with a gun stopped him
[1:22:57.140 --> 1:23:01.140]  Before he could they don't care they want that good guy with the gun removed from the situation
[1:23:01.140 --> 1:23:05.140]  Now we'll come back to this later
[1:23:05.140 --> 1:23:09.140]  In my stack of the crime wave news that we have here
[1:23:09.140 --> 1:23:13.140]  But we continue with the political news
[1:23:13.140 --> 1:23:17.140]  But just know Democrats are still trying to take your guns and make your guns illegal
[1:23:17.140 --> 1:23:21.140]  So that you can be a victim in the next mass shooting once they disarm all their slaves
[1:23:21.140 --> 1:23:25.140]  Democrat party policy
[1:23:25.140 --> 1:23:29.140]  Now you're not really seeing this news anywhere folks but this is the New York Times
[1:23:29.140 --> 1:23:33.140]  This is the New York Times now of course
[1:23:33.140 --> 1:23:37.140]  Fox News and their hosts are mostly embarrassed because they cucked
[1:23:37.140 --> 1:23:41.140]  On election night and they cucked
[1:23:41.140 --> 1:23:45.140]  On January 6th and they took the knee
[1:23:45.140 --> 1:23:49.140]  To the Democrat regime they took the knee to the globalist establishment
[1:23:49.140 --> 1:23:53.140]  The corporate global government establishment they said Trump lost
[1:23:53.140 --> 1:23:57.140]  Trump bad Trump protesters riders bad
[1:23:57.140 --> 1:24:01.140]  Oh but now we look back on it this is the New York Times
[1:24:01.140 --> 1:24:05.140]  Wisconsin Supreme Court prohibits the use
[1:24:05.140 --> 1:24:09.140]  Of most drop boxes for voting
[1:24:09.140 --> 1:24:13.140]  So okay they all admit now the drop boxes well not all of them
[1:24:13.140 --> 1:24:17.140]  But some of the states specifically the ones that were stolen from Trump and they all know it like
[1:24:17.140 --> 1:24:21.140]  Wisconsin they're saying okay we're not doing the drop
[1:24:21.140 --> 1:24:25.140]  Boxes anymore maybe they saw 2000 mules the DVD
[1:24:25.140 --> 1:24:29.140]  If you haven't seen it you can buy it at infowarstore.com highly suggest it
[1:24:29.140 --> 1:24:33.140]  It should be mandatory viewing for all students in schools
[1:24:33.140 --> 1:24:37.140]  See they mandatory view
[1:24:37.140 --> 1:24:41.140]  Al Gore's inconvenient truth which
[1:24:41.140 --> 1:24:45.140]  Quickly just to go off onto a Jag for a second
[1:24:45.140 --> 1:24:49.140]  It's come to a point now where
[1:24:49.140 --> 1:24:53.140]  I get off air and I get home and I watch all the prime time
[1:24:53.140 --> 1:24:57.140]  News coverage and it's like they're covering
[1:24:57.140 --> 1:25:01.140]  Everything that we just discussed that day now and I'm not saying
[1:25:01.140 --> 1:25:05.140]  They're just stealing our content or anything like that whether they are or not
[1:25:05.140 --> 1:25:09.140]  It doesn't matter I'm saying that do you know what a relief it is
[1:25:09.140 --> 1:25:13.140]  To feel like you're out here trying to play
[1:25:13.140 --> 1:25:17.140]  Catch with yourself and then someone else steps on to the
[1:25:17.140 --> 1:25:21.140]  Field and catches it and throws it back to you
[1:25:21.140 --> 1:25:25.140]  I turn on Fox News if you listen yesterday I was covering Al Gore's
[1:25:25.140 --> 1:25:29.140]  Inconvenient Truth he lied about everything you go watch Al Gore's Inconvenient Truth
[1:25:29.140 --> 1:25:33.140]  From I believe 2000 everything he said
[1:25:33.140 --> 1:25:37.140]  Turned out to be wrong literally the entire documentary everything he said was wrong
[1:25:37.140 --> 1:25:41.140]  And so I covered that yesterday I go home Jesse Waters prime time
[1:25:41.140 --> 1:25:45.140]  Is actually playing the clips from Al Gore's
[1:25:45.140 --> 1:25:49.140]  Inconvenient Truth on his gigantic Fox News audience show and I'm just like
[1:25:49.140 --> 1:25:53.140]  Yes, expose these liars
[1:25:53.140 --> 1:25:57.140]  Expose these frauds but getting back to the point
[1:25:57.140 --> 1:26:01.140]  They made Inconvenient Truth mandatory
[1:26:01.140 --> 1:26:05.140]  Viewing in public schools and I remember when this was an issue
[1:26:05.140 --> 1:26:09.140]  Because it didn't last very long
[1:26:09.140 --> 1:26:13.140]  Because people got upset
[1:26:13.140 --> 1:26:17.140]  They made it mandatory viewing in public schools
[1:26:17.140 --> 1:26:21.140]  And then private schools will sometimes adopt
[1:26:21.140 --> 1:26:25.140]  What public schools are going or there'll be a situation where the government
[1:26:25.140 --> 1:26:29.140]  Basically offers you a bribe or says hey we'll give a private school a grant
[1:26:29.140 --> 1:26:33.140]  We'll give you a federal grant or something
[1:26:33.140 --> 1:26:37.140]  Play this documentary teach this teach that do this do that and then
[1:26:37.140 --> 1:26:41.140]  And then a lot of schools will do it and so I don't know the exact story of what happened
[1:26:41.140 --> 1:26:45.140]  At my school but they were considering doing the Inconvenient Truth mandatory
[1:26:45.140 --> 1:26:49.140]  Viewing and there was enough pushback or something
[1:26:49.140 --> 1:26:53.140]  They never did it and I just kind of remember the controversy at the time as a kid
[1:26:53.140 --> 1:26:57.140]  But they made Al Gore's
[1:26:57.140 --> 1:27:01.140]  Inconvenient Truth mandatory viewing at public schools
[1:27:01.140 --> 1:27:05.140]  Everything he said in that movie turned out to be wrong but it's not that it turned out to be wrong
[1:27:05.140 --> 1:27:09.140]  It was all a lie Al Gore's a liar a con man
[1:27:09.140 --> 1:27:13.140]  But they made that mandatory viewing let's make
[1:27:13.140 --> 1:27:17.140]  100,000 mules mandatory viewing for kids in schools
[1:27:17.140 --> 1:27:21.140]  You think the Democrats would like that? Now I'm being a little bit facetious here
[1:27:21.140 --> 1:27:25.140]  I mean yeah probably it should be mandatory viewing
[1:27:25.140 --> 1:27:29.140]  But I won't play the political games like Democrats where we force students
[1:27:29.140 --> 1:27:33.140]  The information we want them to see
[1:27:33.140 --> 1:27:37.140]  To indoctrinate them say no that's what
[1:27:37.140 --> 1:27:41.140]  Democrats do that's why they made kids watching Inconvenient Truth
[1:27:41.140 --> 1:27:45.140]  But back to the point so yeah there it is right there
[1:27:45.140 --> 1:27:49.140]  Back in the day
[1:27:49.140 --> 1:27:53.140]  Oh the film won an Oscar oh my gosh
[1:27:53.140 --> 1:27:57.140]  The film won an Oscar I mean it should
[1:27:57.140 --> 1:28:01.140]  It's a hell of an acting job remember he got on that like he had like
[1:28:01.140 --> 1:28:05.140]  The raising platform this thing was such a joke he gets on
[1:28:05.140 --> 1:28:09.140]  This raised platform he's like he like hits the button and like
[1:28:09.140 --> 1:28:13.140]  And he like goes up he's like this is how hot the temperature will be
[1:28:13.140 --> 1:28:17.140]  He's like I'm getting on an elevator platform to show you how high
[1:28:17.140 --> 1:28:21.140]  The temperatures will go and he like goes up like 80 feet in the air
[1:28:21.140 --> 1:28:25.140]  And he's like got this thing he's like this is how high the temperatures are going to be
[1:28:25.140 --> 1:28:29.140]  And everything he said
[1:28:29.140 --> 1:28:33.140]  What year did he say? I believe he said by 2020 Al Gore said in Inconvenient Truth
[1:28:33.140 --> 1:28:37.140]  By 2020 every ice cap would be melted
[1:28:37.140 --> 1:28:41.140]  Oops the ice caps in the
[1:28:41.140 --> 1:28:45.140]  North Pole and the South Pole have both expanded Al
[1:28:45.140 --> 1:28:47.140]  Oh Al
[1:28:47.140 --> 1:28:49.140]  Oh Al but back to the point

[1:32:40.140 --> 1:32:56.140]  The only way you fail is not writing down the URL jonestaxrelief.com
[1:33:16.140 --> 1:33:20.140]  Live from the info wars.com studios
[1:33:20.140 --> 1:33:23.140]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:33:23.140 --> 1:33:28.140]  And now your host Owen Shroyer
[1:33:28.140 --> 1:33:32.140]  You know let me make a point that it's not made enough here
[1:33:32.140 --> 1:33:41.140]  And it deals with how public schools made it mandatory to view Al Gore's inconvenient truth
[1:33:41.140 --> 1:33:44.140]  Of course the entire documentary ended up being inaccurate
[1:33:44.140 --> 1:33:49.140]  But that's because it was a lie, it wasn't a mistake, it was a lie
[1:33:49.140 --> 1:33:55.140]  But what is this an example of that we see all the time and people don't talk about enough
[1:33:55.140 --> 1:34:04.140]  The democrat party gets, I don't know, hundreds of millions, maybe even billions of dollars in free advertising
[1:34:04.140 --> 1:34:07.140]  And free campaign donations, which is criminal by the way
[1:34:07.140 --> 1:34:11.140]  It's all criminal, it's all illegal, but they get away with it
[1:34:11.140 --> 1:34:19.140]  When public schools and the federal government bribed schools to force their students to watch Al Gore's inconvenient truth
[1:34:19.140 --> 1:34:25.140]  That's democrat party campaigning and propaganda that they get for free
[1:34:25.140 --> 1:34:36.140]  When Facebook and Twitter and Instagram and YouTube block Hunter Biden's laptop from being seen for the public to protect the democrat party
[1:34:36.140 --> 1:34:40.140]  How much money is that worth in political contributions?
[1:34:40.140 --> 1:34:44.140]  Hundreds of millions? Billions?
[1:34:44.140 --> 1:34:49.140]  When they censor Republicans outrightly off the internet
[1:34:49.140 --> 1:34:54.140]  How much is that worth for the democrat party?
[1:34:54.140 --> 1:35:01.140]  When the social media giants promote the fake news like Biden has saved you gas money
[1:35:01.140 --> 1:35:05.140]  How much is that worth in political contributions to the democrat party?
[1:35:05.140 --> 1:35:12.140]  But see, they don't have to count any of it and they get all of it for free
[1:35:12.140 --> 1:35:16.140]  They get all of it for free
[1:35:16.140 --> 1:35:23.140]  Political contributions in kind to the tune of potentially billions of dollars in value
[1:35:23.140 --> 1:35:28.140]  And they don't have to pay a single cent
[1:35:28.140 --> 1:35:32.140]  Maybe that's why they have so much leftover money, they're paying for Republican campaigns now
[1:35:32.140 --> 1:35:34.140]  But that's another story
[1:35:34.140 --> 1:35:39.140]  So Wisconsin prohibits drop boxes because it was used to cheat and steal the election from Trump
[1:35:39.140 --> 1:35:46.140]  A third Wisconsin lawmaker signs to decertify the 2020 presidential elections because the fraud is so obvious
[1:35:46.140 --> 1:35:51.140]  And it's happening in Arizona, it's happening in Michigan
[1:35:51.140 --> 1:36:00.140]  So what do we do? They stole it, Biden got in, he's destroyed this country maybe in some ways and never even fixable
[1:36:00.140 --> 1:36:03.140]  But it's what happened, so what do you do now?
[1:36:03.140 --> 1:36:10.140]  You're the democrats, you just up the propaganda, you up the censorship, you up the attacks
[1:36:10.140 --> 1:36:13.140]  And you ignore this news coming out
[1:36:13.140 --> 1:36:16.140]  But it's very real now
[1:36:16.140 --> 1:36:24.140]  And the balancing act or the tug of war would be
[1:36:24.140 --> 1:36:31.140]  Are there going to be enough serious people watching the midterm elections, watching for fraud
[1:36:31.140 --> 1:36:40.140]  That we can actually have a free and fair election in 100 days, give or take
[1:36:40.140 --> 1:36:53.140]  And actually see the red wave that has been boiling over but had a false lid put on it for so many years because of these rigged elections
[1:36:53.140 --> 1:37:02.140]  But I mean when they can steal the presidential election and then turn right back around and then do it in Georgia right in front of our face with the exact same techniques again
[1:37:02.140 --> 1:37:09.140]  That's pathetic, so you know they're going to try
[1:37:09.140 --> 1:37:19.140]  But yeah, here it is in Georgia, Atlanta area district attorney, that's Fulton County, Fanny Willis
[1:37:19.140 --> 1:37:23.140]  I do believe she's a Soros one too
[1:37:23.140 --> 1:37:29.140]  Guys, type in Fanny Willis, George Soros, I'm pretty sure
[1:37:29.140 --> 1:37:42.140]  The Atlanta area prosecutor who is probing the effort by former president Donald Trump and his allies to over tone the 2020 election result in Georgia was disqualified by a judge Monday
[1:37:42.140 --> 1:37:51.140]  Criminally investigating one of the 16 Republicans who served on a phony slate of Trump electors
[1:37:51.140 --> 1:37:58.140]  So again this is just, this is just news indicating that people are starting to realize what's going on
[1:37:58.140 --> 1:38:08.140]  They're starting to realize how deep the election fraud is, they're starting to realize how bad it is, and they're starting to realize how deep the corruption goes
[1:38:08.140 --> 1:38:13.140]  I mean that has Soros written all over it man
[1:38:13.140 --> 1:38:20.140]  That has Soros written all over it, there it is, I knew it, I knew it was there
[1:38:20.140 --> 1:38:31.140]  Soros DA disqualified from investigating the big theft or covering up rather the big theft of Georgia in the 2020 presidential election
[1:38:31.140 --> 1:38:37.140]  We all know it, they lied about the pipes bursting, they shoved as many ballots into those counters in Atlanta as they possibly could
[1:38:37.140 --> 1:38:42.140]  They were pulling out trunks of ballots from under the tables when they closed the polling locations
[1:38:42.140 --> 1:38:49.140]  I mean it's a damn joke, Trump winning all day, all night long, then 3am, 300,000 votes for Biden comes in and they quit counting
[1:38:49.140 --> 1:38:53.140]  Give me a break, it goes on
[1:38:53.140 --> 1:39:07.140]  Machines stole another race in Colorado, flipped vote totals from GOP grassroots favorite Linda Wilson after election called and gave them to Rhino Lundin brazen fraud
[1:39:07.140 --> 1:39:11.140]  Well the Republican establishment cheats too
[1:39:11.140 --> 1:39:19.140]  And that would be why, because you may be asking why when you've seen the story if you've seen it lately
[1:39:19.140 --> 1:39:28.140]  Political groups and nonprofits aligned with the Democrat party have spent nearly $44 million to boost the profile of far right candidates
[1:39:28.140 --> 1:39:33.140]  Democrat strategy is rooted in the belief that these candidates will be easier to defeat in a general election
[1:39:33.140 --> 1:39:37.140]  Now folks, this is just wild stuff
[1:39:37.140 --> 1:39:44.140]  Democrats giving tens of millions of dollars to Republican candidates that they call terrorists and white supremacists
[1:39:44.140 --> 1:39:47.140]  And they think that they're going to be easier to beat
[1:39:47.140 --> 1:39:55.140]  But then you've got the phenomenon of these Republican rhinos going into Republican grassroots and those elections being rigged too
[1:39:55.140 --> 1:40:08.140]  But why are Democrats, why are Democrats funding millions of dollars to Republican campaigns? That is wacky wild stuff
[1:40:08.140 --> 1:40:12.140]  And I really don't even know where to follow that bouncing ball
[1:40:12.140 --> 1:40:17.140]  So I'm just going to put it out there and you can decide because that I don't know about that
[1:40:17.140 --> 1:40:23.140]  That's just Democrats, that just maybe chalk that one into Democrats are just losing their damn minds
[1:40:23.140 --> 1:40:26.140]  Maybe you chalk that one up to that
[1:40:26.140 --> 1:40:29.140]  Like this
[1:40:29.140 --> 1:40:35.140]  Biden administration moves to give illegal immigrants federal ID and government benefits
[1:40:35.140 --> 1:40:39.140]  Well, I mean, yeah, that's just legalizing what they're already doing
[1:40:39.140 --> 1:40:47.140]  Government benefits, are you kidding me? Just walking through the country and getting the escort in with the red carpet is a government benefit
[1:40:47.140 --> 1:40:51.140]  Just us having open borders is the government benefit
[1:40:51.140 --> 1:40:55.140]  I mean, I covered this yesterday and I don't have a big stack of this in front of me today but
[1:40:55.140 --> 1:41:01.140]  I mean, you do know that Mayor Kess is saying that the border is closed
[1:41:01.140 --> 1:41:07.140]  He goes on TV and he says there is no open border, there is no illegal immigrant crisis
[1:41:07.140 --> 1:41:09.140]  It's not going on, the border is secure
[1:41:09.140 --> 1:41:16.140]  I mean, and you know, I meant to do this actually and if McBreen is listening, I don't know if you've got any video projects
[1:41:16.140 --> 1:41:21.140]  But here's what we should do is we should just take all the footage we have
[1:41:21.140 --> 1:41:27.140]  You can go to Bill Mellogen's account, you can go to Griff Jenkins' account, you can go to Savannah Hernandez' account
[1:41:27.140 --> 1:41:30.140]  You can go to Jorge Ventura's account, you can go to Drew Hernandez' account
[1:41:30.140 --> 1:41:36.140]  There's all these accounts, you just go to their Twitter accounts, download the hours
[1:41:36.140 --> 1:41:42.140]  The hours of the illegal immigrants pouring over the southern border
[1:41:42.140 --> 1:41:50.140]  And I would say speed it up, like speed it up like five times so that you can condense it into like two minutes or something
[1:41:50.140 --> 1:41:55.140]  And then you just have Mayor Kess saying there is no open border, there is no illegal immigrant crisis
[1:41:55.140 --> 1:41:58.140]  There is no open border, there is no illegal immigrant crisis
[1:41:58.140 --> 1:42:04.140]  And just have that footage, it's a tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands just pouring in non-stop every day
[1:42:04.140 --> 1:42:07.140]  And then maybe put the Benny Hill theme behind it too
[1:42:07.140 --> 1:42:13.140]  So that's just kind of a little, that's just a little directive here put out on air, we'll see if we can get that done
[1:42:13.140 --> 1:42:19.140]  But I mean seriously, they come out and they say there is no open border, the border is secure, there is no illegal immigrant crisis

[1:45:27.140 --> 1:45:36.140]  I mean just like we try our best with our news coverage and our information we do the best with our supplements as well
[1:45:36.140 --> 1:45:40.140]  I mean look at the hair and beard support formula folks this is a joke
[1:45:40.140 --> 1:45:45.140]  I mean we're giving this thing away it's 75% off by the way it works for me in case you haven't noticed
[1:45:45.140 --> 1:45:55.140]  the hair and beard formula is working for me quite well I might add quite well my barber appreciates hair and beard support for men
[1:45:55.140 --> 1:45:57.140]  I go and see him quite often now
[1:45:57.140 --> 1:46:03.140]  If you're like myself and so many other people on this planet especially as you get older you gain weight even if you eat a lot less

[1:46:08.140 --> 1:46:15.140]  So we looked at the supplement market that we fund a lot of our operations with and we said what are the best selling natural
[1:46:15.140 --> 1:46:19.140]  healthy anti-fat weight loss products that are out there
[1:46:19.140 --> 1:46:25.140]  We went and looked at the Top 10 and they all had the same ingredients in common that is in this product
[1:46:25.140 --> 1:46:35.140]  But with our new product from X7 Diet Force we got the very best concentrates of these known natural essences
[1:46:35.140 --> 1:46:40.140]  That's two amazing things for your body and so I've lost almost 40 pounds

[1:46:52.140 --> 1:47:08.140]  infowarsstore.com Diet Force you need to take this product it really works
[1:47:08.140 --> 1:47:23.140]  So you just heard me in the last segment I was just kind of giving out directives live on air that's just how it works around here like I said it's just wild berserkers just berserking for freedom
[1:47:23.140 --> 1:47:31.140]  berserking for truth berserking for justice berserking for humanity berserking for life
[1:47:31.140 --> 1:47:39.140]  And that's why the devil tries to keep us down and so I gave out the directive I said hey we should do this video for the open border and McBreen heard me he comes in here
[1:47:39.140 --> 1:47:50.140]  he's like yeah we're gonna start working on that immediately and I just want to explain something here because it doesn't get covered correctly in the media
[1:47:50.140 --> 1:47:58.140]  they lie about it when they say oh Alex Jones makes $500 million or whatever selling supplements it's all ridiculous
[1:47:58.140 --> 1:48:08.140]  and so when they try to get these settlements and by the way here's the local reporter covering this as Alex Jones is in court today
[1:48:08.140 --> 1:48:12.140]  here's the local reporter covering this
[1:48:12.140 --> 1:48:18.140]  info wars host Alex Jones defamation trial begins today
[1:48:18.140 --> 1:48:31.140]  over the next two weeks a jury will hear the facts of the case and decide the amount of money Jones should pay the parents of one of the children killed in Sandy Hook shooting which he claimed was a hoax
[1:48:31.140 --> 1:48:41.140]  now of course this local journalist Avery Travis doesn't say that he has since denied it was a hoax and said that he was wrong probably thousands of times now she doesn't include that in her coverage
[1:48:41.140 --> 1:48:50.140]  she probably doesn't know any better to be fair because she's not gonna dig she's just gonna go with the propaganda and do what she's told for the local news outlet
[1:48:50.140 --> 1:48:58.140]  but yeah there you go so the jury decides how much he should pay not if he's guilty or not just the judge decided that already before the case for the trial
[1:48:58.140 --> 1:49:05.140]  and then just said how much and they say what do you what do you think about $100 some of the jury say sure I guess $100 million $100 million
[1:49:05.140 --> 1:49:15.140]  they tried to find me a million dollars it's just crazy this after courts in Texas and Connecticut issued default judgments finding him liable
[1:49:15.140 --> 1:49:31.140]  the jury will be considering punitive damages as well as compensatory damages during this trial so so that's where Alex is but they write stories and they say Alex Jones makes hundreds of millions of dollars
[1:49:31.140 --> 1:49:43.140]  look at the supplement money and everything if a supplement company makes $100 million in profit then that's a supplement company making $100 million in profit
[1:49:43.140 --> 1:49:59.140]  if info wars store.com makes $100 million in profit that goes to info wars that's not profit that gets pocketed that goes into the operation that pays for the bandwidth on band.video
[1:49:59.140 --> 1:50:08.140]  but more importantly and here's what I want to say and that's why I bring up Darren McBreen talking about this video to me in the break and we're kind of just going over some ins and outs
[1:50:08.140 --> 1:50:22.140]  folks that's money that pays the crew so they really just want to take the money from the crew is what it is and it's really sad a lot of the crew here has family
[1:50:22.140 --> 1:50:35.140]  and they want to shut this place down and they want to put fathers and mothers out into the the market not knowing how they're going to pay for their next mortgage or whatever
[1:50:35.140 --> 1:50:45.140]  and they like that they think that's good so no it's not it's not Alex Jones makes millions of dollars in profits
[1:50:45.140 --> 1:50:56.140]  no it's our supplements make millions of dollars that then fund the operation to build the studios and have the great crew which by the way works seven days a week
[1:50:56.140 --> 1:51:20.140]  so it's really it's really disheartening and sad even to just to see how cold hearted they are to not even realize you know you think you're destroying Alex Jones you're not but really what you're doing is you're just hurting a bunch of good people that work seven days a week
[1:51:20.140 --> 1:51:34.140]  and just want to have a job and they say a Jones makes millions of dollars no no he doesn't actually our crew makes it makes modest salaries there nobody here's nobody here's a millionaire nobody's here is you know buying a bunch of
[1:51:34.140 --> 1:51:50.140]  foreign luxury cars and big mansions like BLM or anything so no Alex Jones makes money selling supplements to fund this operation and fund the crew and they say he makes hundreds of billions so we have to get a hundred million dollar judgment against him
[1:51:50.140 --> 1:52:03.140]  all you're really doing is you're you're putting a hundred people out of work but you love that that's what you do your Democrats your liberals that that's your entire operational procedures to shut down industry shut down civilization shut down the economy watch everybody die and celebrate on the way out
[1:52:03.140 --> 1:52:16.140]  so just angers me because this crew is so great and the people that work here so great and that's who they're really attacking that's who they're really going to hurt when they think they're going after Alex Jones
[1:52:16.140 --> 1:52:29.140]  but see they they don't have anything past one line of thinking they can only think one level one at a time so they just don't even think they just don't even have any foresight don't have any multi-dimensional thought process at all
[1:52:29.140 --> 1:52:35.140]  they just think oh there's Alex Jones in front of us yeah uh chum in the water let's get him
[1:52:35.140 --> 1:52:40.140]  and then you're just putting if you if you if you shut this place down you're putting a hundred great people out of work
[1:52:40.140 --> 1:52:50.140]  but you feel good about that so folks that's why we encourage you to shop at info wars store dot com not so people around here can get rich that's not going on
[1:52:50.140 --> 1:53:02.140]  so we can have a great crew and that you can get a great supplement you can get the great toothpaste you can get the great books you can get the great documentaries you can get the great air filters you can get the great water filters
[1:53:02.140 --> 1:53:29.140]  it's all at info wars store dot com and by the way you know I'm sitting here I forget who I was talking to about this but they're like like don't but aren't you you know aren't you afraid like they're coming after you like they're never going to stop and there's all this stuff and I'm like you know it just hits me
[1:53:29.140 --> 1:53:45.140]  literally folks the political opposition the democrats liberals that hate me they have gone through my entire life they've gone through all they literally have access to every bank transaction I've ever made multiple accounts
[1:53:45.140 --> 1:54:06.140]  they have all my phone records they have all my emails they literally have everything everything that is Owen shroyer in a digital database they have and it's funny because like aren't you worried and I'm really not like there's nothing there
[1:54:06.140 --> 1:54:21.140]  that's what I'm saying like good you've done the proctology exam of me you've combed through my life with a fine tooth comb you've gone through everything Owen shroyer has ever done every every data point every bank transaction
[1:54:21.140 --> 1:54:40.140]  every email every phone call every text and watch they'll have nothing they'll have nothing and so it's just hilarious to me like yeah I mean do I like having to cooperate with feds do I like having my whole life poured through
[1:54:40.140 --> 1:54:57.140]  by these creeps and crooks not really but okay like I'll come out on the other side just the same and they'll have nothing on me and that angers them so much that there's nothing there you have no idea
[1:54:57.140 --> 1:55:10.140]  it's just it's just crazy but I'm going off on a jag the point is if they shut this place down which you know they want to do it's not really about hurting Alex Jones they might think that that's what it's going to do you're just going to make Alex Jones more of a legend
[1:55:10.140 --> 1:55:19.140]  but what you are going to do is you're going to hurt a hundred innocent people that work here work hard every day and have families that's who you're really going to hurt
[1:55:19.140 --> 1:55:29.140]  but you know maybe I shouldn't even tell them that because that might that might edge them on a little bit more like we can hurt more people we can hurt more people behind Alex Jones yeah
[1:55:29.140 --> 1:55:39.140]  so stand up for this crew and shop at info wars store dot com all right I just went off on a bit of a rant there let me refocus myself here but
[1:55:39.140 --> 1:55:53.140]  let's let's have a little fun this is the great Ben Berquam we do have an open border by the way and so let's think if there's all these people coming in here and Joe Biden wants to get them voting as soon as possible
[1:55:53.140 --> 1:56:04.140]  maybe we should have a voter registration down there at the border and so Ben Berquam does a little comedy clip here and he puts a Trump voter registration at the southern border
[1:56:04.140 --> 1:56:11.140] .
[1:56:11.140 --> 1:56:24.140] .
[1:56:24.140 --> 1:56:25.140]  Thank you.
[1:56:25.140 --> 1:56:26.140]  Oh, yes.
[1:56:26.140 --> 1:56:27.140]  Make sure you vote.
[1:56:27.140 --> 1:56:28.140]  Trump.
[1:56:28.140 --> 1:56:29.140]  Trump.
[1:56:29.140 --> 1:56:30.140]  Maga.
[1:56:30.140 --> 1:56:31.140]  Maga.
[1:56:31.140 --> 1:56:32.140]  Maga.
[1:56:32.140 --> 1:56:33.140]  2022.
[1:56:33.140 --> 1:56:34.140]  Volta.
[1:56:34.140 --> 1:56:35.140]  Yes.
[1:56:35.140 --> 1:56:36.140]  Hey, guys.
[1:56:36.140 --> 1:56:37.140]  We're at the end of the wall here.
[1:56:37.140 --> 1:56:38.140]  We're in Yuma, Arizona.
[1:56:38.140 --> 1:56:41.660]  This is where Joe Biden, one of the areas where Joe Biden sends the massive groups of
[1:56:41.660 --> 1:56:43.820]  illegal aliens to invade our country.
[1:56:43.820 --> 1:56:47.580]  You can see here, President Trump's big, beautiful wall and the end of it.
[1:56:47.580 --> 1:56:52.260]  This is where they simply walk around and come in and I figured since Joe Biden and
[1:56:52.260 --> 1:56:58.220]  the Democrats are simply allowing this invasion to try to get more illegal votes in the 2022-2024
[1:56:58.220 --> 1:56:59.220]  election.
[1:56:59.220 --> 1:57:03.660]  We might as well play the same game, so we've got a Maga voter registration set up over
[1:57:03.660 --> 1:57:04.660]  here.
[1:57:04.660 --> 1:57:05.660]  We're going to be talking to the folks.
[1:57:05.660 --> 1:57:10.540]  They're all coming, most of them now, from socialist communist countries escaping socialism
[1:57:10.540 --> 1:57:14.340]  and communism from Cuba and Venezuela and other countries around the world.
[1:57:14.340 --> 1:57:18.780]  They don't know that the Democrats like Joe Biden are socialists and communists.
[1:57:18.780 --> 1:57:22.020]  So we're going to educate them on that and make sure when they register to vote they
[1:57:22.020 --> 1:57:23.580]  don't vote Democrat.
[1:57:23.580 --> 1:57:30.460]  You know, even though this is kind of a troll, kind of a comedy piece here, this is the illegal
[1:57:30.460 --> 1:57:31.460]  immigrants are coming in.
[1:57:31.460 --> 1:57:35.380]  I mean, but really though, it's like, I mean, if we're not going to stop them, nobody's
[1:57:35.380 --> 1:57:36.380]  stopping them.
[1:57:36.380 --> 1:57:38.460]  Nobody's stopping the illegal immigration.
[1:57:38.460 --> 1:57:40.820]  We might as well try to get them on our team.
[1:57:40.820 --> 1:57:47.700]  We might as well try to warn them about the crooks and the demons known as Democrats.
[1:57:47.700 --> 1:57:53.180]  The globalist great reset or the war for the world is here, but humanity is not being caught

[2:00:53.660 --> 2:00:55.380]  of southeast Portland.
[2:00:55.380 --> 2:00:58.220]  Now it's right outside their front door.
[2:00:58.220 --> 2:00:59.220]  I want to cry.
[2:00:59.220 --> 2:01:00.820]  I just want my house back.
[2:01:00.820 --> 2:01:05.420]  Christina Hartnett lives on 80th and Powell, where a majority of the campers stay.
[2:01:05.420 --> 2:01:09.260]  My lawn is now becoming a public bathroom.
[2:01:09.260 --> 2:01:12.300]  She fears leaving her house just to go to work.
[2:01:12.300 --> 2:01:18.940]  And it is scary when you have grown men methraging in your driveway, the last thing I feel safe
[2:01:18.940 --> 2:01:23.740]  doing is going out and saying, Hey, can I, can you please move so I can go to work?
[2:01:23.740 --> 2:01:27.940]  Calling the police in city is an everyday chore with little reward.
[2:01:27.940 --> 2:01:30.460]  So far no one has come to help us.
[2:01:30.460 --> 2:01:34.180]  Central City Concern Clean Start crews assessed this site Thursday.
[2:01:34.180 --> 2:01:38.740]  It was one of about 1900 other campsites reported just this week.
[2:01:38.740 --> 2:01:45.500]  In the past 10 days, they found 272 encampments that pose a greater health and safety risk,
[2:01:45.500 --> 2:01:48.900]  which is why they haven't removed the camps in this neighborhood.
[2:01:48.900 --> 2:01:53.060]  But just getting the city to come out and assess it has been a full time job.
[2:01:53.060 --> 2:01:58.660]  I have to report from like four different, four different bureaus, and I have to report
[2:01:58.660 --> 2:02:03.180]  that report to report, and I have to report that report to a second report.
[2:02:03.180 --> 2:02:06.260]  And it's the only way to get any kind of traction.
[2:02:06.260 --> 2:02:09.940]  I feel like nobody hears us.
[2:02:09.940 --> 2:02:11.220]  Nobody cares about us.
[2:02:11.220 --> 2:02:15.500]  This mother didn't want to be identified on camera, afraid of retaliation from those living
[2:02:15.500 --> 2:02:16.860]  on the streets.
[2:02:16.860 --> 2:02:19.340]  She rarely lets her children outside to play.
[2:02:19.340 --> 2:02:24.820]  It's very sad because they're just kids, so they want to play.
[2:02:24.820 --> 2:02:27.100]  I don't know where they're coming from.
[2:02:27.100 --> 2:02:30.300]  Tess has lived in this neighborhood for 35 years.
[2:02:30.300 --> 2:02:34.860]  These boards now cover her front door windows after they were smashed by those living on
[2:02:34.860 --> 2:02:36.100]  the streets.
[2:02:36.100 --> 2:02:40.220]  She also installed security cameras around her house.
[2:02:40.220 --> 2:02:41.220]  Scared?
[2:02:41.220 --> 2:02:44.580]  Mosable scared because I don't know what they're going to go next.
[2:02:44.580 --> 2:02:47.140]  It's also affecting a nearby restaurant.
[2:02:47.140 --> 2:02:51.780]  It unnerves our customers when they pull in and they see people overdosing and the sidewalks
[2:02:51.780 --> 2:02:53.180]  out in front of our restaurant.
[2:02:53.180 --> 2:02:57.780]  It's, it is going to take one of us getting severely hurt or killed before they will do
[2:02:57.780 --> 2:02:59.580]  anything to come help us.
[2:02:59.580 --> 2:03:01.900]  Meanwhile, please come help me.
[2:03:01.900 --> 2:03:06.420]  Does our city do something about it?
[2:03:06.420 --> 2:03:10.380]  Are they doing something about these people that need some help?
[2:03:10.380 --> 2:03:14.100]  This never-ending cry for help continues.
[2:03:14.100 --> 2:03:17.460]  Wow, good job liberals.
[2:03:17.460 --> 2:03:18.860]  Aren't you proud of yourself?
[2:03:18.860 --> 2:03:20.800]  You've done great work.
[2:03:20.800 --> 2:03:23.700]  Great work there in Portland.
[2:03:23.700 --> 2:03:29.980]  Now, you want a taste of the future in a liberal woketopia.
[2:03:29.980 --> 2:03:33.620]  You want a taste of the future in the World Economic Forum, great reset.
[2:03:33.620 --> 2:03:37.700]  You want a taste of what communism and socialism and liberalism looks like in America.
[2:03:37.700 --> 2:03:39.340]  You just got it.
[2:03:39.340 --> 2:03:41.100]  That's it right there, Portland.
[2:03:41.100 --> 2:03:42.100]  No safety.
[2:03:42.100 --> 2:03:43.780]  By the way, they'll disarm the citizens.
[2:03:43.780 --> 2:03:47.220]  So those poor women that fear for their lives, they're not allowed to have guns.
[2:03:47.220 --> 2:03:48.980]  So their houses can be broken into.
[2:03:48.980 --> 2:03:54.820]  They can be raped, tortured by some meth addict, some mental patient meth addict that just
[2:03:54.820 --> 2:03:55.820]  roams the streets.
[2:03:55.820 --> 2:03:58.500]  Oh, they won't be able to defend themselves, cough won't come.
[2:03:58.500 --> 2:03:59.500]  That's just how it is.
[2:03:59.500 --> 2:04:01.220]  That's Oregon, baby.
[2:04:01.220 --> 2:04:02.780]  That's your liberal utopia.
[2:04:02.780 --> 2:04:06.020]  You want a taste of what the left is going to do to this country.
[2:04:06.020 --> 2:04:08.860]  You go to Portland, you find out real quick.
[2:04:08.860 --> 2:04:15.220]  Now, sadly, I bet the people that got interviewed for that news clip probably still vote Democrat
[2:04:15.220 --> 2:04:19.300]  because they still don't get it.
[2:04:19.300 --> 2:04:27.540]  But how far have we fallen as a prosperous nation that in a great city of Portland that
[2:04:27.540 --> 2:04:32.260]  a situation like that even exists?
[2:04:32.260 --> 2:04:39.660]  Where we have clear and present individuals who belong in mental institutions, just being
[2:04:39.660 --> 2:04:48.500]  left to fend for themselves on the streets and to torment the local citizens.
[2:04:48.500 --> 2:04:50.660]  And you can't have a gun and there's no police.
[2:04:50.660 --> 2:04:57.980]  I mean, that's, that's your future under Democrat Party rule.
[2:04:57.980 --> 2:05:03.460]  The globalist great reset or the war for the world is here, but humanity is not being caught
[2:05:03.460 --> 2:05:07.980]  flat footed because of info wars and because of your support.
[2:05:07.980 --> 2:05:12.620]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is now more important than ever as we reach the critical heart of
[2:05:12.620 --> 2:05:17.900]  the battle that you spread the word and that you support liberty and that you warn people
[2:05:17.900 --> 2:05:20.580]  like you've never done before.
[2:05:20.580 --> 2:05:22.940]  We have come so far together.
[2:05:22.940 --> 2:05:24.300]  Please help keep us from the year.
[2:05:24.300 --> 2:05:27.980]  We're under massive attack right now, but we're going to win with your help.
[2:05:27.980 --> 2:05:31.300]  We're going to overcome this with your help and with God's blessing.
[2:05:31.300 --> 2:05:34.700]  Please go to infoworkstore.com and get this book.
[2:05:34.700 --> 2:05:37.020]  Many, many, many years of research have gone into this.
[2:05:37.020 --> 2:05:42.580]  The great reset and the war for the world available right now at infoworkstore.com.
[2:05:42.580 --> 2:05:45.260]  There's also signed copies available as well.
[2:05:45.260 --> 2:05:48.660]  We have a lot of other big projects we're working on that are about to start launching
[2:05:48.660 --> 2:05:53.220]  as well, but this is the cavalry because we need the funding and you need this book because
[2:05:53.220 --> 2:05:55.620]  it warns the world of the globalist plan.
[2:05:55.620 --> 2:06:21.620]  And now the tip of the spear, leaving the fight to take back the nation, it's Owen Troyer.
[2:06:21.620 --> 2:06:38.580]  Good afternoon, I want to welcome these leaders who are coming in to have this very important
[2:06:38.580 --> 2:06:46.020]  discussion about some of the most pressing issues of our time.
[2:06:46.020 --> 2:06:47.500]  I am Kamala Harris.
[2:06:47.500 --> 2:06:57.180]  My pronouns are she and her, I am a woman sitting at the table wearing a blue suit.
[2:06:57.180 --> 2:07:05.700]  She truly just, her knowledge, her intellect is just expanding rapidly by the day and magical
[2:07:05.700 --> 2:07:07.100]  stuff there from Kamala Harris.
[2:07:07.100 --> 2:07:11.300]  I guess she's filling in for Biden right now, he's got a cancer bit or something or I don't
[2:07:11.300 --> 2:07:12.300]  know what's going on with him.
[2:07:12.300 --> 2:07:16.860]  Nobody actually knows, not even him, but hey Kamala Harris wants you to know that she uses
[2:07:16.860 --> 2:07:20.580]  her pronouns and that she's a woman.
[2:07:20.580 --> 2:07:25.420]  And she's actually claims she's wearing a blue jacket, but I don't know about that.
[2:07:25.420 --> 2:07:29.500]  That we might have to do a fact check on.
[2:07:29.500 --> 2:07:34.580]  But as far as her being a woman, I think Willie Brown knows well, that's probably accurate.
[2:07:34.580 --> 2:07:40.660]  So she, her pronouns, thank you Kamala, you're doing such a great job while Biden is out
[2:07:40.660 --> 2:07:44.300]  with cancer or COVID or well, whatever.
[2:07:44.300 --> 2:07:49.500]  Boy, oh boy, what an absolute clown show this has become.
[2:07:49.500 --> 2:07:54.060]  This has become a clown show really quickly.
[2:07:54.060 --> 2:07:59.540]  And now Biden, as the cabinet is shrinking and shrinking, it's a barren cabinet, just
[2:07:59.540 --> 2:08:03.980]  like the supply chain, just like the shelves are empty at the stores, the Biden cabinet
[2:08:03.980 --> 2:08:04.980]  is empty as well.
[2:08:04.980 --> 2:08:08.620]  Everybody's quitting, but they were able to hire a new one.
[2:08:08.620 --> 2:08:14.260]  And that is the new deputy national cyber security director, Camille Stewart.
[2:08:14.260 --> 2:08:15.740]  This woman should scare you.
[2:08:15.740 --> 2:08:19.100]  She used to work at Google.
[2:08:19.100 --> 2:08:25.060]  And of course we know that Google worked with China to round up dissidents, round up Uighurs
[2:08:25.060 --> 2:08:28.420]  and put them into concentration and forced labor camps.
[2:08:28.420 --> 2:08:30.020]  So she worked there.
[2:08:30.020 --> 2:08:33.020]  Now she works for Biden.
[2:08:33.020 --> 2:08:40.220]  But she wants you to know that as the cyber security chief, she wants you to know that
[2:08:40.220 --> 2:08:43.860]  systemic racism is the biggest threat to U.S. security.
[2:08:43.860 --> 2:08:44.860]  That's nice.
[2:08:44.860 --> 2:08:50.500]  You get in there and you don't really care about the Chinese espionage, the TikTok issue.
[2:08:50.500 --> 2:08:54.540]  You know, no, no, no, no, you're not even worried about the elections being hacked, nothing
[2:08:54.540 --> 2:08:55.540]  like that.
[2:08:55.540 --> 2:08:57.060]  You're worried about racism.
[2:08:57.060 --> 2:09:03.540]  And we all know why, because you're black and you want free stuff.
[2:09:03.540 --> 2:09:07.860]  And you're almost assuredly somebody that has benefited from affirmative action, but
[2:09:07.860 --> 2:09:10.820]  that's not enough for you.
[2:09:10.820 --> 2:09:13.660]  You want free stuff.
[2:09:13.660 --> 2:09:15.700]  So systemic racism is the issue.
[2:09:15.700 --> 2:09:25.220]  Of course, the irony is, if there's systemic racism, it would be all anti-white.
[2:09:25.220 --> 2:09:34.260]  I bet you either directly or through osmosis, Camille Stewart is a benefactor of affirmative
[2:09:34.260 --> 2:09:38.020]  action.
[2:09:38.020 --> 2:09:43.060]  But she says it's racism, of course, against black people.
[2:09:43.060 --> 2:09:44.060]  That is the big issue.
[2:09:44.060 --> 2:09:46.940]  And she wants a race-focused defense agenda.
[2:09:46.940 --> 2:09:50.260]  Boy, oh boy, we're screwed.
[2:09:50.260 --> 2:09:54.220]  We are screwed if that's how she looks at it.
[2:09:54.220 --> 2:09:58.460]  And it is how she looks at it.
[2:09:58.460 --> 2:10:00.060]  And so who knows what comes next?
[2:10:00.060 --> 2:10:05.860]  She might just want to start rounding up white people, because, you know, she worked at Google
[2:10:05.860 --> 2:10:10.100]  that likes rounding up the dissidents.
[2:10:10.100 --> 2:10:19.340]  It's total insanity, but it's racism and it's what Democrats and liberals do to get power.
[2:10:19.340 --> 2:10:28.020]  Because they accuse people of racism to get power out of it in the victim economy.
[2:10:28.020 --> 2:10:29.940]  Now why would Republicans do this?
[2:10:29.940 --> 2:10:35.940]  RNC to award Milwaukee with 2024 convention, the same city involved in swinging 2020 election
[2:10:35.940 --> 2:10:36.940]  to Democrats.
[2:10:36.940 --> 2:10:44.220]  Yeah, it was Milwaukee where the voter fraud happened in mass that flipped the state from
[2:10:44.220 --> 2:10:46.420]  Trump to Biden.
[2:10:46.420 --> 2:10:48.100]  And folks, we have all this down.
[2:10:48.100 --> 2:10:49.540]  We know what happened.
[2:10:49.540 --> 2:10:51.840]  How did they steal Pennsylvania?
[2:10:51.840 --> 2:10:56.460]  They stole it in Pittsburgh and mostly in Philadelphia is where they stole it.
[2:10:56.460 --> 2:10:57.820]  How did they steal Wisconsin?
[2:10:57.820 --> 2:11:01.140]  They stole it in mostly it was Milwaukee, but there were some other counties that there
[2:11:01.140 --> 2:11:02.980]  were some shenanigans in too.
[2:11:02.980 --> 2:11:10.460]  Same with Michigan, mostly Detroit, Georgia, mostly Atlanta, Arizona, mostly Phoenix.
[2:11:10.460 --> 2:11:11.460]  And so that's what they did.
[2:11:11.460 --> 2:11:14.940]  And Milwaukee was one of those states that the Democrats used to steal the election.
[2:11:14.940 --> 2:11:18.580]  And now the Republicans are going to go to Milwaukee to have their convention.
[2:11:18.580 --> 2:11:25.220]  An interesting strategy, but there it is.
[2:11:25.220 --> 2:11:29.060]  Now who's going to be running, you think, for the Democrats?
[2:11:29.060 --> 2:11:35.940]  They've already all pretty much said Biden's out, which is hilariously ironic, but it really
[2:11:35.940 --> 2:11:39.140]  just shows how they don't even know what's going on because the whole thing was rigged
[2:11:39.140 --> 2:11:40.140]  for Biden to begin with.
[2:11:40.140 --> 2:11:41.460]  Biden never wanted to debate.
[2:11:41.460 --> 2:11:43.660]  Biden didn't even campaign.
[2:11:43.660 --> 2:11:46.140]  Biden got called a racist during the debates.
[2:11:46.140 --> 2:11:53.620]  Biden had multiple jokes referring to his old age or his lack of memory or comprehension
[2:11:53.620 --> 2:11:56.820]  during the debates, but he still pulled it out somehow.
[2:11:56.820 --> 2:12:02.180]  Well, Cernovich and others, including Alex Jones, are convinced that Newsom is the 2024
[2:12:02.180 --> 2:12:03.180]  nominee.
[2:12:03.180 --> 2:12:10.660]  And I'm tending to agree, but here's an interesting way to look at it, which pop cultural, but
[2:12:10.660 --> 2:12:14.420]  I think it's accurate because these are liberals that are obsessed with pop culture.
[2:12:14.420 --> 2:12:15.420]  It controls their life.
[2:12:15.420 --> 2:12:18.660]  It's the propaganda that drives them.
[2:12:18.660 --> 2:12:23.220]  Gavin Newsom is so clearly the 2024 nominee that it's not even up for debate.
[2:12:23.220 --> 2:12:27.540]  The American Psycho Lookalike is straight out of central casting for a 50 Shades of
[2:12:27.540 --> 2:12:28.700]  Grey movie.
[2:12:28.700 --> 2:12:31.780]  That book series sold over 200 million copies.
[2:12:31.780 --> 2:12:34.740]  He is their fantasy.
[2:12:34.740 --> 2:12:35.740]  I think they're right.
[2:12:35.740 --> 2:12:41.740]  Unlike the American Psycho Tyrant who's going to dominate them, that's what these people
[2:12:41.740 --> 2:12:42.740]  want.
[2:12:42.740 --> 2:12:44.300]  That's what these freak liberals want.
[2:12:44.300 --> 2:12:48.980]  They want the American Psycho who's going to dominate them, but then not live by any
[2:12:48.980 --> 2:12:52.020]  of his own rules, by any of his own standards.
[2:12:52.020 --> 2:12:56.220]  And that's what they're going to get, and that's going to be Gavin Newsom.
[2:12:56.220 --> 2:13:06.860]  And he's going to be the Trudeau of the United States, except maybe worse if that's possible.
[2:13:06.860 --> 2:13:10.900]  Maybe he might be worse.
[2:13:10.900 --> 2:13:12.700]  Maybe he's not the American Psycho Lookalike.
[2:13:12.700 --> 2:13:16.380]  Maybe he's just the American Psycho.
[2:13:16.380 --> 2:13:18.380]  Rules for thee, but not for me.
[2:13:18.380 --> 2:13:23.460]  That's Gavin Newsom's slogan.
[2:13:23.460 --> 2:13:38.740]  And even though he had to win another election, they're going to pick him as their 2024 candidate.
[2:13:38.740 --> 2:13:40.860]  I think that's why he's buying ads in Florida.
[2:13:40.860 --> 2:13:43.300]  I think that's why he's buying ads in Texas.
[2:13:43.300 --> 2:13:45.340]  I think it is going to be Gavin Newsom.
[2:13:45.340 --> 2:13:46.940]  He fits the bill.
[2:13:46.940 --> 2:13:52.740]  They love hating on white men, but then they put the most stereotypical rich white male
[2:13:52.740 --> 2:13:56.980]  liberal up there to dominate them, and they smile and love it because he looks like the
[2:13:56.980 --> 2:14:00.500]  American Psycho, and that's their dream man.
[2:14:00.500 --> 2:14:04.140]  Oh, boy, oh, boy, and then there's Hunter Biden.
[2:14:04.140 --> 2:14:05.540]  Maybe he'll be the vice president.
[2:14:05.540 --> 2:14:11.060]  Hunter Biden evidence wrongly labeled disinformation by FBI, according to an FBI whistleblower.
[2:14:11.060 --> 2:14:13.940]  Oh, wow, you don't say Senator Chuck Grassley.
[2:14:13.940 --> 2:14:19.060]  I mean, imagine this dinosaur, Chuck Grassley, is the one that has to call this out.
[2:14:19.060 --> 2:14:23.420]  Chuck Grassley alleges FBI intentionally downplayed negative information about Hunter Biden.
[2:14:23.420 --> 2:14:25.780]  So I mentioned this earlier.
[2:14:25.780 --> 2:14:30.060]  What is that worth in political contribution in kind?
[2:14:30.060 --> 2:14:36.660]  What is it worth for big tech and mainstream media fully colluded with the Democrat Party
[2:14:36.660 --> 2:14:42.820]  to censor the Hunter Biden laptop story before the presidential election?
[2:14:42.820 --> 2:14:46.020]  What is that worth in political donations?
[2:14:46.020 --> 2:14:49.540]  A hundred million dollars?
[2:14:49.540 --> 2:14:58.380]  And then what is it worth for the FBI to be involved with the cover up?
[2:14:58.380 --> 2:14:59.380]  What was it?
[2:14:59.380 --> 2:15:02.860]  It was the same story with Russian collusion and Hunter Biden's laptop, and you had, it
[2:15:02.860 --> 2:15:09.020]  was like 50 intelligence community officials say Trump colluded with Russia.
[2:15:09.020 --> 2:15:10.020]  They all lied.
[2:15:10.020 --> 2:15:15.980]  50 intelligence officials say that the Hunter Biden laptop is fake and just Russian disinformation.
[2:15:15.980 --> 2:15:18.260]  They all lied.
[2:15:18.260 --> 2:15:22.420]  How much is that worth in political contributions in kind?
[2:15:22.420 --> 2:15:23.580]  A hundred million dollars?
[2:15:23.580 --> 2:15:26.180]  A billion dollars?
[2:15:26.180 --> 2:15:31.620]  I mean, they don't have to, they don't have to mark that as a political contribution.
[2:15:31.620 --> 2:15:33.860]  They just get that for free.
[2:15:33.860 --> 2:15:36.460]  They just get that for free.
[2:15:36.460 --> 2:15:39.220]  Total criminal behavior.
[2:15:39.220 --> 2:15:43.180]  And then covering up the criminal behavior of Hunter Biden.
[2:15:43.180 --> 2:15:46.220]  Now, that story is not going anywhere.
[2:15:46.220 --> 2:15:48.540]  We'll see about the charges.
[2:15:48.540 --> 2:15:57.220]  But I mean, it's pretty obvious Hunter Biden is guilty of a large handful of criminal acts.
[2:15:57.220 --> 2:15:59.220]  Sold out for more than six months.

[2:19:01.700 --> 2:19:06.300]  relationships, to annihilate our marriages and the studies are all clear.
[2:19:06.300 --> 2:19:12.940]  The number one cause of marital splits is that there's problems in the bedroom and the number
[2:19:12.940 --> 2:19:16.660]  one issue men have is erectile dysfunction.
[2:19:16.660 --> 2:19:20.300]  Ladies and gentlemen, the left makes big jokes about this because they don't want people
[2:19:20.300 --> 2:19:24.740]  having lasting good, loving relationships, they want to break up society.
[2:19:24.740 --> 2:19:32.060]  We are so excited to have the number one natural male enhancement pill in the world available

[2:19:57.500 --> 2:20:10.820]  Meeting of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:20:10.820 --> 2:20:26.900]  So, we've reached a certain point in this clown world, in this great reset versus the
[2:20:26.900 --> 2:20:32.740]  great awakening where the agents of chaos, the agents of destruction, the agents of the
[2:20:32.740 --> 2:20:41.380]  big lies, the agents of the deception, like Majorcus and Fauci and others are just, they
[2:20:41.380 --> 2:20:53.340]  can't be more obvious in their deception where Fauci on tape says we need to lock everything
[2:20:53.340 --> 2:20:57.820]  down and then Fauci on tape says I never called for anything being locked down.
[2:20:57.820 --> 2:21:01.820]  So Fauci is now going on television saying I didn't want any shutdowns, I didn't want
[2:21:01.820 --> 2:21:06.100]  any lockdowns, I had nothing to do with that, COVID, I've never even heard of COVID.
[2:21:06.100 --> 2:21:12.580]  As if you're so stupid, you don't remember him going on TV for thousands of hours promoting
[2:21:12.580 --> 2:21:16.860]  the fear for COVID and the lockdowns and the shutdowns and everything.
[2:21:16.860 --> 2:21:22.580]  So here's the latest clip, Fauci on TV yesterday saying I never thought COVID, I don't know
[2:21:22.580 --> 2:21:28.020]  anything about lockdowns and then of course, just a little snippet of Fauci doing exactly
[2:21:28.020 --> 2:21:30.180]  what he claims he didn't do, here it is.
[2:21:30.180 --> 2:21:36.220]  I wonder if you would recommend locking down schools if you had to do it all over again?
[2:21:36.220 --> 2:21:41.820]  Well again, first of all, I didn't recommend locking anything down, you're asking me questions,
[2:21:41.820 --> 2:21:47.900]  you're talking about the CDC is the public health agency that uses their epidemiologists
[2:21:47.900 --> 2:21:52.460]  and their science-based approach to make recommendations.
[2:21:52.460 --> 2:21:58.060]  It was a decision to make a recommendation to the president, it wasn't my decision that
[2:21:58.060 --> 2:22:07.340]  I could implement and when it became clear that when we had community spread in the country
[2:22:07.340 --> 2:22:13.220]  with a few cases of community spread, this was way before there was a major explosion
[2:22:13.220 --> 2:22:18.700]  like we saw in the northeastern corridor driven by New York City metropolitan area.
[2:22:18.700 --> 2:22:22.820]  I recommended to the president that we shut the country down.
[2:22:22.820 --> 2:22:29.260]  Oh, I didn't say we should shut anything down, yeah, you literally did and you bragged about
[2:22:29.260 --> 2:22:30.260]  it.
[2:22:30.260 --> 2:22:37.220]  And by the way, that's just Fauci in 2020 versus Fauci yesterday, these videos are only
[2:22:37.220 --> 2:22:42.060]  going to increase because Fauci called for a shutdown probably a hundred times on television
[2:22:42.060 --> 2:22:47.580]  and he's in the news today and I don't know if I have it on my desk but you guys can pull
[2:22:47.580 --> 2:22:49.060]  it up.
[2:22:49.060 --> 2:22:55.660]  Fauci's in the news today saying he thinks we should have had more strict lockdowns.
[2:22:55.660 --> 2:22:58.380]  So I mean, just guys pull up any of the stories on that today.
[2:22:58.380 --> 2:23:00.300]  Fauci saying we need more strict lockdowns.
[2:23:00.300 --> 2:23:05.260]  So he goes on TV and he says, I never called for lockdowns in response to COVID, I never
[2:23:05.260 --> 2:23:09.020]  called for any of that, okay, fine, we'll just pull the dozens of clips of you calling
[2:23:09.020 --> 2:23:13.980]  for that, that's no problem at all, we'll show the world you're a complete liar.
[2:23:13.980 --> 2:23:19.420]  But then the same day he says I never called for lockdowns, he says there should have been
[2:23:19.420 --> 2:23:23.460]  stricter lockdowns.
[2:23:23.460 --> 2:23:27.100]  It might have even been in the same interview, in fact, was it the same interview?
[2:23:27.100 --> 2:23:32.740]  Guys, put on the screen, the first clip we just played for me.
[2:23:32.740 --> 2:23:38.220]  It was the same interview.
[2:23:38.220 --> 2:23:42.700]  Why are we still listening to this piece of crap?
[2:23:42.700 --> 2:23:44.540]  Why is this lying con man?
[2:23:44.540 --> 2:23:53.700]  By the way, did you know not only is Anthony Fauci the highest paid government employee
[2:23:53.700 --> 2:23:58.340]  and not only does Fauci make hundreds of millions of dollars on the side with secret contracts,
[2:23:58.340 --> 2:24:01.900]  you remember that they had a hearing and he was asked about the hundreds of millions
[2:24:01.900 --> 2:24:05.340]  of dollars that he received for secret contracts and he said, oh, I'm not going to disclose
[2:24:05.340 --> 2:24:06.340]  where that money went.
[2:24:06.340 --> 2:24:10.860]  Oh, I think we know why went right in your pockets, didn't it?
[2:24:10.860 --> 2:24:15.940]  Fauci, yeah, you made hundreds of millions of dollars from your power.
[2:24:15.940 --> 2:24:27.140]  He also now when he retires is set to make, I think the number was $540,000 a year pension
[2:24:27.140 --> 2:24:28.940]  when Fauci retires.
[2:24:28.940 --> 2:24:33.700]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's more than the president of the United States salary.
[2:24:33.700 --> 2:24:37.580]  That's more than the president of the United States pension.
[2:24:37.580 --> 2:24:41.700]  Fauci makes more money than any other government employee and will make more money in pension
[2:24:41.700 --> 2:24:43.780]  than any other government employee.
[2:24:43.780 --> 2:24:45.900]  How does that work?
[2:24:45.900 --> 2:24:53.260]  Plus makes hundreds of millions of dollars on the side by having big pharmaceutical companies
[2:24:53.260 --> 2:24:58.940]  and others pay him to do experiments and run tests at the NIH and other labs that he runs
[2:24:58.940 --> 2:25:01.980]  and he makes hundreds of millions of dollars doing that.
[2:25:01.980 --> 2:25:10.060]  This is a greedy psycho, Anthony Fauci, responsible for probably thousands, if not tens of thousands
[2:25:10.060 --> 2:25:15.020]  of people dying during the gay AIDS pandemic.
[2:25:15.020 --> 2:25:17.220]  Everybody knew it was Fauci killing them.
[2:25:17.220 --> 2:25:25.780]  They made whole movies about it like the one with Matthew McConaughey, Dallas Buyers Club.
[2:25:25.780 --> 2:25:30.340]  Not to mention Fauci tortures and kills puppies.
[2:25:30.340 --> 2:25:34.860]  Not to mention Fauci makes viruses in labs that kill millions of people.
[2:25:34.860 --> 2:25:38.260]  Not to mention he calls for lockdowns that kill millions of people.
[2:25:38.260 --> 2:25:41.980]  Then he goes on TV and lies and said, I never did that.
[2:25:41.980 --> 2:25:42.980]  You're right, Fauci.
[2:25:42.980 --> 2:25:44.940]  You never called for lockdowns.
[2:25:44.940 --> 2:25:47.340]  You never made a virus in a lab.
[2:25:47.340 --> 2:25:49.820]  You never made hundreds of millions of dollars.
[2:25:49.820 --> 2:25:55.620]  You never gave bad advice to people that were getting AIDS in the gay community in the 80s.
[2:25:55.620 --> 2:25:58.340]  You never did any of that, did you, Fauci?
[2:25:58.340 --> 2:26:03.500]  You never did any of it.
[2:26:03.500 --> 2:26:06.620]  That'll be the day.
[2:26:06.620 --> 2:26:11.780]  That'll be the day that the humanity, the good in this world starts to conquer the evil
[2:26:11.780 --> 2:26:21.740]  when people like Anthony Fauci are held in a court of law, investigated and held responsible
[2:26:21.740 --> 2:26:25.980]  and liable for everything that they've done.
[2:26:25.980 --> 2:26:33.300]  And Fauci is one of the worst on the planet, truly, truly is.
[2:26:33.300 --> 2:26:37.880]  But see, this is how you know that he knows he's failing.
[2:26:37.880 --> 2:26:40.780]  This is how you know that they know they're in trouble.
[2:26:40.780 --> 2:26:45.380]  You don't think Anthony Fauci is well aware that he went on TV for 12 months calling for
[2:26:45.380 --> 2:26:46.380]  lockdowns.
[2:26:46.380 --> 2:26:50.100]  You don't think people remember all the press conferences and all the times he bragged taking
[2:26:50.100 --> 2:26:52.860]  responsibility for telling Trump to close the country.
[2:26:52.860 --> 2:26:57.740]  And then he goes on TV and says, I never called for any of that, and then in the same interview,
[2:26:57.740 --> 2:27:02.340]  he says, by the way, I wish I would have called for stricter shutdowns.
[2:27:02.340 --> 2:27:03.340]  He's failing.
[2:27:03.340 --> 2:27:04.340]  He's flopping.
[2:27:04.340 --> 2:27:06.740]  It's like what I said at the beginning of the show.
[2:27:06.740 --> 2:27:12.460]  They are like a fish out of water on the pool deck, flopping around like a carp.
[2:27:12.460 --> 2:27:13.460]  Their time is up.
[2:27:13.460 --> 2:27:15.420]  They're out of the water.
[2:27:15.420 --> 2:27:16.700]  Humanity's awakening.
[2:27:16.700 --> 2:27:20.460]  Now, the problem is, they're just going to get more violent, they're just going to get
[2:27:20.460 --> 2:27:21.460]  more extreme.
[2:27:21.460 --> 2:27:23.900]  They're going to get more aggressive in their rhetoric, more aggressive in their criminal
[2:27:23.900 --> 2:27:26.980]  activity.
[2:27:26.980 --> 2:27:33.060]  And we just have to pray to God, folks, because we're going to go through some serious trials
[2:27:33.060 --> 2:27:34.820]  here.
[2:27:34.820 --> 2:27:38.020]  And through it, there will be tribulation, but we're going to go with some, we're going
[2:27:38.020 --> 2:27:41.460]  to go through some serious stuff, and we deserve it.
[2:27:41.460 --> 2:27:44.280]  And we just got to stay focused on what's good.
[2:27:44.280 --> 2:27:45.820]  We got to stay focused on what's right.
[2:27:45.820 --> 2:27:51.380]  We got to pray for God's guidance, God's courage.
[2:27:51.380 --> 2:27:55.420]  God's protective hand, because, I mean, we're going up against the devil that's been running
[2:27:55.420 --> 2:27:58.740]  this world for a long, long time.
[2:27:58.740 --> 2:28:03.300]  And his little demon agents like Anthony Fauci do not want to let go of their false power,
[2:28:03.300 --> 2:28:10.620]  because they know when they lose it, they're going to be the ones under criminal investigation.
[2:28:10.620 --> 2:28:14.700]  And so that's why they're flopping and flailing around, Fauci, oh, I never called for lockdowns.
[2:28:14.700 --> 2:28:17.140]  By the way, I wish there were more strict lockdowns.
[2:28:17.140 --> 2:28:19.660]  They're losing their minds, folks.
[2:28:19.660 --> 2:28:24.700]  These are psychotic, maniacal criminals that are at the end of their rope, and they know
[2:28:24.700 --> 2:28:25.820]  it.
[2:28:25.820 --> 2:28:27.100]  The awakening is on.
[2:28:27.100 --> 2:28:29.020]  All they have is their fake news.
[2:28:29.020 --> 2:28:31.700]  All they have is their propaganda.
[2:28:31.700 --> 2:28:35.860]  All they have is their criminal activity.
[2:28:35.860 --> 2:28:40.580]  And all of that is slowly but surely being exposed.
[2:28:40.580 --> 2:28:43.180]  And you're just going to see more odd behavior from them.
[2:28:43.180 --> 2:28:46.180]  You're saying, how could Fauci say that on a TV interview?
[2:28:46.180 --> 2:28:48.020]  They're losing the plot, folks.
[2:28:48.020 --> 2:28:50.780]  They're losing their grip of control.
[2:28:50.780 --> 2:28:53.940]  So yeah, they're going to get even more strange as this happens.
[2:28:53.940 --> 2:29:02.100]  The globalist great reset or the war for the world is here, but humanity is not being caught
[2:29:02.100 --> 2:29:06.660]  flat footed because of info wars and because of your support.
[2:29:06.660 --> 2:29:11.300]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is now more important than ever as we reach the critical heart of
[2:29:11.300 --> 2:29:16.580]  the battle that you spread the word and that you support liberty and that you warn people
[2:29:16.580 --> 2:29:19.260]  like you've never done before.
[2:29:19.260 --> 2:29:21.620]  We have come so far together.
[2:29:21.620 --> 2:29:23.140]  Please help keep us on the air.
[2:29:23.140 --> 2:29:26.660]  We're under massive attack right now, but we're going to win with your help.
[2:29:26.660 --> 2:29:29.980]  We're going to overcome this with your help and with God's blessing.
[2:29:29.980 --> 2:29:33.380]  Please go to infowarstore.com and get this book.
[2:29:33.380 --> 2:29:35.700]  Many, many, many years of research have gone into this.
[2:29:35.700 --> 2:29:41.260]  The great reset and the war for the world available right now at infowarstore.com.
[2:29:41.260 --> 2:29:43.820]  There's also signed copies available as well.
[2:29:43.820 --> 2:29:47.300]  We've got a lot of other big projects we're working on that are about to start launching
[2:29:47.300 --> 2:29:48.300]  as well.
[2:29:48.300 --> 2:29:52.020]  But this is the cavalry because we need the funding and you need this book because it
[2:29:52.020 --> 2:29:54.260]  warns the world of the globalist plan.
[2:29:54.260 --> 2:29:56.860]  Get the great reset at infowarstore.com.
[2:29:56.860 --> 2:30:03.060]  We are now living in the void sliding towards collapse in the strange space between what
[2:30:03.060 --> 2:30:05.460]  we've known and what's to come.
[2:30:05.460 --> 2:30:10.740]  And right now, the most important thing to remember is don't panic.
[2:30:10.740 --> 2:30:16.060]  Stay calm because now is the time that we must get our bearings and steer the ship onto
[2:30:16.060 --> 2:30:18.260]  a safe sound course.
[2:30:18.260 --> 2:30:24.060]  There is nothing stopping we the people from making our own rules and building our own
[2:30:24.060 --> 2:30:25.140]  society.
[2:30:25.140 --> 2:30:30.700]  All we got to do is survive the crash and right now we still have time to prepare.
[2:30:30.700 --> 2:30:34.980]  The world fiat currency system is racing towards zero.
[2:30:34.980 --> 2:30:41.340]  It's time to convert it into hard assets now, including food, water, and survival gear.

[2:32:01.980 --> 2:32:07.780]  the world, the civilian market two years ago, the bio pros, for septic tanks, for port-a-potties,

[2:32:20.700 --> 2:32:27.260]  it, because this stuff will eat anything that is organic and it's exclusively available

[2:33:17.420 --> 2:33:24.660]  You want to stop tyranny, well so does he, it's Alex Jones, and now your host, Owen
[2:33:24.660 --> 2:33:25.660]  Troyer.
[2:33:25.660 --> 2:33:34.380]  So, without getting into specifics, let me just further expand on what we closed the
[2:33:34.380 --> 2:33:39.620]  last segment with.
[2:33:39.620 --> 2:33:48.800]  This is truly maybe the greatest test of the United States in its existence.
[2:33:48.800 --> 2:33:52.300]  It probably is the greatest test this country has ever faced as far as if we're going to
[2:33:52.300 --> 2:33:57.620]  make it into the future with the bill of rights, with prosperity, with freedom, with everything
[2:33:57.620 --> 2:34:03.820]  that comes with the republic.
[2:34:03.820 --> 2:34:09.940]  And what you're going to see is the criminal element that has been robbing this country,
[2:34:09.940 --> 2:34:15.060]  sabotaging this country, is going to get more outlandish, more crazed, more criminal in
[2:34:15.060 --> 2:34:18.940]  their operations because they're being exposed and they have no choice.
[2:34:18.940 --> 2:34:22.180]  They have to go for broke now to destroy this country.
[2:34:22.180 --> 2:34:25.100]  That's the shot they're taking.
[2:34:25.100 --> 2:34:29.700]  Or America will survive this, get through this, and once again, be the beacon of hope,
[2:34:29.700 --> 2:34:33.580]  be the beacon of freedom, be the beacon of prosperity for the entire planet.
[2:34:33.580 --> 2:34:36.540]  That's the crossroads that we're at right now.
[2:34:36.540 --> 2:34:37.540]  Here's some of the examples.
[2:34:37.540 --> 2:34:42.780]  I mean, wide open borders, I mean, just total invasion at the southern border, the political
[2:34:42.780 --> 2:34:49.140]  persecution and imprisonment of their opposition, the unbelievable stuff that's taking place
[2:34:49.140 --> 2:34:58.900]  in legal cases, the outright sexualization and perversion and pedophilia that's going
[2:34:58.900 --> 2:35:04.620]  on in the classrooms with the young kids.
[2:35:04.620 --> 2:35:08.900]  Democrats going on TV saying, we never called to defund the police, republicans did that.
[2:35:08.900 --> 2:35:17.380]  Fauci saying, I never said to shut down the country, we all know he did that.
[2:35:17.380 --> 2:35:20.900]  So you're sitting here, you're saying this, this is unbelievable, this is so over the
[2:35:20.900 --> 2:35:25.860]  top, this is so outlandish, this is so outrageous, this is so in my face, this is so criminal.
[2:35:25.860 --> 2:35:32.700]  Yeah, there has been a criminal element sabotaging and robbing this country dry, selling it out
[2:35:32.700 --> 2:35:38.860]  for decades, and they're now so exposed that they have no other option but to just fully
[2:35:38.860 --> 2:35:44.160]  go for broke, just right there blatantly for all to see.
[2:35:44.160 --> 2:35:49.780]  And they know that as long as they do enough to destroy this country, the UN, the World
[2:35:49.780 --> 2:35:54.460]  Economic Forum will come in and take control and that's it.
[2:35:54.460 --> 2:35:57.340]  And that's when they believe they'll be able to get away with all their crimes or if they
[2:35:57.340 --> 2:36:01.100]  can start some sort of a World War situation.
[2:36:01.100 --> 2:36:06.700]  So that's what you're seeing, you're seeing the criminal element, the giant criminal element
[2:36:06.700 --> 2:36:12.500]  that has been sabotaging, selling this country out and robbing it dry for my entire life
[2:36:12.500 --> 2:36:19.780]  is being fully exposed and now they're going into their fits of rage in their final moments.
[2:36:19.780 --> 2:36:25.140]  So that's what's going on right now and we're all here to see it.
[2:36:25.140 --> 2:36:32.660]  And you know, it's again, it's a situation where you can see how it's going to get worse,
[2:36:32.660 --> 2:36:37.220]  but it's a situation where you can also see how you can come out on the other end of this
[2:36:37.220 --> 2:36:40.460]  and be better off than ever before.
[2:36:40.460 --> 2:36:45.220]  Because yeah, we're going to have to expose the criminals before they go down.
[2:36:45.220 --> 2:36:48.940]  So it's like, is it a good thing that Anthony Fauci has been exposed the last two years
[2:36:48.940 --> 2:36:51.940]  with all the destruction and death that has happened because of it?
[2:36:51.940 --> 2:36:59.940]  Well, no, that's not good, but boy, oh boy, aren't we glad we know who that demon is now.
[2:36:59.940 --> 2:37:03.500]  And here's more of the proof that that's going on.
[2:37:03.500 --> 2:37:11.980]  Alex Jones' new book, The Great Reset and the War for the World is topping best seller
[2:37:11.980 --> 2:37:12.980]  lists.
[2:37:12.980 --> 2:37:15.140]  Let me even look at all the different categories.
[2:37:15.140 --> 2:37:19.740]  It topped the best seller list in the world history, it topped the best seller list in
[2:37:19.740 --> 2:37:25.660]  movers and shakers, it topped the best sellers list in political corruption and misconduct,
[2:37:25.660 --> 2:37:31.260]  it topped the best sellers in communication and media studies.
[2:37:31.260 --> 2:37:36.140]  That's just some of them, by the way.
[2:37:36.140 --> 2:37:39.580]  So and this is without barely any promotion, folks.
[2:37:39.580 --> 2:37:40.780]  We barely promoted this thing.
[2:37:40.780 --> 2:37:45.020]  We're so inundated with just news coverage and everything else that's going on here.
[2:37:45.020 --> 2:37:47.380]  Just like kind of slipped through the cracks.
[2:37:47.380 --> 2:37:57.180]  So I mean, number one, number one, number one, after all the attacks, after all the censorship,
[2:37:57.180 --> 2:38:05.620]  after all the lies and the slander and the libel, still number one.
[2:38:05.620 --> 2:38:11.140]  And you know that all that's going to do is motivate them to attack Alex Jones and sensor
[2:38:11.140 --> 2:38:16.500]  Alex Jones and shut this operation down.
[2:38:16.500 --> 2:38:25.780]  And I mean, I'll just tell you, they just asked for $150 million in court today, $150
[2:38:25.780 --> 2:38:28.620]  million, folks.
[2:38:28.620 --> 2:38:37.500]  Does that sound like somebody who is suffering from trauma, asking for $150 million?
[2:38:37.500 --> 2:38:44.980]  So we're not going to make $150 million off the book, but you can buy it right now at
[2:38:44.980 --> 2:38:52.380]  infowarstore.com or if you want to kind of get involved with the culture war there on
[2:38:52.380 --> 2:38:56.780]  the Amazon bestseller list, you can go to Amazon and you can buy it right now.
[2:38:56.780 --> 2:38:59.860]  The Great Reset and the War for the World by Alex Jones.
[2:38:59.860 --> 2:39:04.300]  Again, infowarstore.com or on Amazon.
[2:39:04.300 --> 2:39:11.940]  It's kind of like, you know, pick your poison where neither is necessarily poison.
[2:39:11.940 --> 2:39:13.460]  You buy it from infowarstore.com.
[2:39:13.460 --> 2:39:14.460]  That's great.
[2:39:14.460 --> 2:39:15.460]  It goes right to us.
[2:39:15.460 --> 2:39:16.460]  You buy it from Amazon.
[2:39:16.460 --> 2:39:23.660]  Well, Amazon gets a little cut, but it continues to climb the bestsellers list.
[2:39:23.660 --> 2:39:27.420]  Of course, Alex Jones' book is number one in political corruption and misconduct.
[2:39:27.420 --> 2:39:32.060]  Alex Jones has been the groundbreaking example of exposing political corruption and misconduct
[2:39:32.060 --> 2:39:40.660]  right here, right here on these airwaves that I'm honored to be on right now.
[2:39:40.660 --> 2:39:51.180]  You know, I really am not one that gets stressed out or, you know, feels the pressure of moments
[2:39:51.180 --> 2:39:53.060]  or anything.
[2:39:53.060 --> 2:39:54.380]  I'm very zenned out.
[2:39:54.380 --> 2:40:00.660]  I'm very just like, I don't even know what you would call it like I'm just, but I got
[2:40:00.660 --> 2:40:07.700]  to tell you, I was actually struggling to sleep last night because I was really thinking
[2:40:07.700 --> 2:40:12.700]  about what a historic time we're in right now.
[2:40:12.700 --> 2:40:17.660]  Not just the country, but I mean, just specifically info wars, this audience, this crew, myself,
[2:40:17.660 --> 2:40:23.980]  it was a little overwhelming because I don't think of myself as a big deal.
[2:40:23.980 --> 2:40:26.300]  I don't, I mean, we don't even hear at info wars.
[2:40:26.300 --> 2:40:30.060]  Honestly, we like, we don't, it's like we don't even think of ourselves as that big
[2:40:30.060 --> 2:40:31.060]  deal.
[2:40:31.060 --> 2:40:32.060]  It's kind of a problem.
[2:40:32.060 --> 2:40:34.020]  It's like we're, you can call it humble or humility or whatever.
[2:40:34.020 --> 2:40:42.620]  It's just part of the problem is we don't realize like, hey, we're a big fricking deal, man.
[2:40:42.620 --> 2:40:45.380]  And then, but then you realize it's like, wow, okay, well, we didn't even promote this
[2:40:45.380 --> 2:40:46.380]  book.
[2:40:46.380 --> 2:40:47.700]  It's a number one bestseller.
[2:40:47.700 --> 2:40:53.940]  And now they're asking for $150 million judgment against Alex Jones.
[2:40:53.940 --> 2:40:55.580]  The judge already determined he's guilty.
[2:40:55.580 --> 2:41:00.700]  And now they're just asking for $150 million.
[2:41:00.700 --> 2:41:05.660]  So it just kind of, it kind of hits you pretty heavily because now I'm sitting here and Alex
[2:41:05.660 --> 2:41:06.660]  Jones seat.
[2:41:06.660 --> 2:41:09.540]  I mean, it's like, what?
[2:41:09.540 --> 2:41:13.860]  But let me just, let me just come back down to earth now, but buy the book folks, get
[2:41:13.860 --> 2:41:19.060]  it on Amazon, shoot it to the top of the bestseller list, keep it there, buy it on infowarstore.com.
[2:41:19.060 --> 2:41:23.820]  Let's keep this, let's keep this operation fighting government corruption, fighting
[2:41:23.820 --> 2:41:29.020]  political misconduct, fighting tyranny, fighting propaganda.
[2:41:29.020 --> 2:41:31.340]  Let's keep this train going.
[2:41:31.340 --> 2:41:32.420]  Let's keep it going.
[2:41:32.420 --> 2:41:34.940]  And it's sad that people want to shut down so much.
[2:41:34.940 --> 2:41:39.940]  I guess that tells you about what those people are involved with.
[2:41:39.940 --> 2:41:41.420]  I guess it does.
[2:41:41.420 --> 2:41:49.660]  All right, I'm going to, I'm going to cover the news, one more stack of news before our
[2:41:49.660 --> 2:41:55.260]  guest host takes over and then I'm back hosting the war room.
[2:41:55.260 --> 2:42:01.580]  But well, I'm almost out of time to do anything now.
[2:42:01.580 --> 2:42:05.340]  So we'll just have to come back and do it.
[2:42:05.340 --> 2:42:14.940]  Okay, so let's just, let's just look at a tweet from Biden here that's just hilarious.
[2:42:14.940 --> 2:42:19.020]  Because the Democrats are now saying they never wanted to defund the police.
[2:42:19.020 --> 2:42:22.140]  They're saying we were never defunding the police.
[2:42:22.140 --> 2:42:23.140]  They go on TV.
[2:42:23.140 --> 2:42:24.300]  We never defunded the police.
[2:42:24.300 --> 2:42:32.620]  By the way, the RNC official GOP account put up a 10 minute compilation of Democrats,
[2:42:32.620 --> 2:42:36.620]  not media members, Democrat party members in Congress saying defund the police.
[2:42:36.620 --> 2:42:40.380]  And then Biden says you can't be pro police and pro insurrection.
[2:42:40.380 --> 2:42:43.980]  There was no insurrection and Democrats are anti police.
[2:42:43.980 --> 2:42:46.460]  So again, this is another example.
[2:42:46.460 --> 2:42:50.420]  The corrupt individuals and Democrat party, Republican party media, they're like fish
[2:42:50.420 --> 2:42:55.260]  out of water, flopping around on the deck, gasping in their last moments.
[2:42:55.260 --> 2:43:01.740]  The globalist great reset or the war for the world is here, but humanity is not being caught
[2:43:01.740 --> 2:43:06.180]  flat footed because of info wars and because of your support.
[2:43:06.180 --> 2:43:10.860]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is now more important than ever as we reach the critical heart of

[2:43:16.140 --> 2:43:18.820]  like you've never done before.
[2:43:18.820 --> 2:43:21.180]  We have come so far together.
[2:43:21.180 --> 2:43:22.700]  Please help keep us on the air.
[2:43:22.700 --> 2:43:26.220]  We're under massive attack right now, but we're going to win with your help.
[2:43:26.220 --> 2:43:29.540]  We're going to overcome this with your help and with God's blessing.
[2:43:29.540 --> 2:43:32.940]  Please go to infoworkstore.com and get this book.
[2:43:32.940 --> 2:43:35.260]  Many, many, many years of research have gone into this.

[2:43:46.860 --> 2:43:47.860]  as well.
[2:43:47.860 --> 2:43:51.580]  But this is the cavalry because we need the funding and you need this book because it
[2:43:51.580 --> 2:43:53.820]  warns the world of the globalist plan.

[2:44:06.700 --> 2:44:10.220]  And as Ward said, you're not going to find a better place for information.
[2:44:10.220 --> 2:44:11.860]  You might not agree with everything.
[2:44:11.860 --> 2:44:15.820]  You might not agree with all our perspectives, but we cover all the information.
[2:44:15.820 --> 2:44:18.100]  And there's nowhere else really that does it like we do here.
[2:44:18.100 --> 2:44:19.620]  Thank you for that, Ward.
[2:44:19.620 --> 2:44:23.860]  Infowarsstore.com, by the way, the products he mentions, infowarsstore.com is where to
[2:44:23.860 --> 2:44:24.860]  get them, folks.
[2:44:24.860 --> 2:44:26.180]  And we do have the best supplements.
[2:44:26.180 --> 2:44:32.180]  I mean, just like we try our best with our news coverage and our information, we do the
[2:44:32.180 --> 2:44:34.740]  best with our supplements as well.
[2:44:34.740 --> 2:44:37.140]  I mean, look at the hair and beard support formula.
[2:44:37.140 --> 2:44:38.140]  Folks, this is a joke.
[2:44:38.140 --> 2:44:40.460]  I mean, we're giving this thing away.
[2:44:40.460 --> 2:44:43.020]  75% off, by the way, it works for me.
[2:44:43.020 --> 2:44:48.340]  In case you haven't noticed, the hair and beard formula is working for me.
[2:44:48.340 --> 2:44:51.380]  Quite well, I might add, quite well.
[2:44:51.380 --> 2:44:54.380]  My barber appreciates hair and beard support for men.
[2:44:54.380 --> 2:44:56.340]  I go and see him quite often now.
[2:44:56.340 --> 2:45:02.540]  We are now living in the void, sliding towards collapse in the strange space between what
[2:45:02.540 --> 2:45:04.940]  we've known and what's to come.
[2:45:04.940 --> 2:45:10.220]  And right now, the most important thing to remember is don't panic.
[2:45:10.220 --> 2:45:15.540]  Stay calm, because now is the time that we must get our bearings and steer the ship onto
[2:45:15.540 --> 2:45:17.740]  a safe sound course.
[2:45:17.740 --> 2:45:23.140]  There is nothing stopping we, the people, from making our own rules and building our
[2:45:23.140 --> 2:45:24.620]  own society.
[2:45:24.620 --> 2:45:27.220]  All we got to do is survive the crash.
[2:45:27.220 --> 2:45:30.180]  And right now, we still have time to prepare.
[2:45:30.180 --> 2:45:34.460]  The world fiat currency system is racing towards zero.
[2:45:34.460 --> 2:45:40.780]  It's time to convert it into hard assets now, including food, water, and survival gear,
[2:45:40.780 --> 2:45:43.220]  to keep us strong and at the ready.
[2:45:43.220 --> 2:45:50.940]  Go to preparedtoday.com for the essentials, storable foods, water filtration, first aid,
[2:45:50.940 --> 2:45:55.980]  power, and more at preparedtoday.com.

[2:47:27.780 --> 2:47:46.780]  All right, well, things are incoming here, and so I may or may not be having a special
[2:47:46.780 --> 2:47:52.300]  guest in studio very soon.
[2:47:52.300 --> 2:47:55.380]  So it's confirmed then, guys, is it confirmed?
[2:47:55.380 --> 2:48:01.860]  All right, it is now official, I have been given the green light to announce, Alex Jones
[2:48:01.860 --> 2:48:11.260]  is coming in studio, and we'll be back any minute now with breaking news.
[2:48:11.260 --> 2:48:18.260]  So I've been given the green light to let you know that is coming up today.
[2:48:18.260 --> 2:48:29.700]  And so we have actually moved way now en route off the docket for the fourth hour today because
[2:48:29.700 --> 2:48:34.660]  Alex is going to come in, and I believe either co-host with me or just hosted himself.
[2:48:34.660 --> 2:48:37.860]  So that's coming up.
[2:48:37.860 --> 2:48:41.140]  Now let's do this.
[2:48:41.140 --> 2:48:44.820]  Let me just cover this stack of news here.
[2:48:44.820 --> 2:48:46.620]  Or should I go to these video clips, actually?
[2:48:46.620 --> 2:48:51.940]  Tell you what, let's go to these video clips because this is even more ridiculous.
[2:48:51.940 --> 2:48:56.260]  And it's just like Fauci saying, I never called for a lockdown, I don't know about any of
[2:48:56.260 --> 2:48:57.260]  that.
[2:48:57.260 --> 2:48:58.660]  I never called for a shutdown, that wasn't me.
[2:48:58.660 --> 2:49:02.020]  It's like, oh, really, here's just hours of you on TV doing just that.
[2:49:02.020 --> 2:49:05.020]  But okay, Fauci, yeah, keep telling the world you're a liar.
[2:49:05.020 --> 2:49:11.980]  So Eric Adams, the mayor of New York City, has had his moment now.
[2:49:11.980 --> 2:49:17.300]  Now remember, Democrats in New York City made New York City a sanctuary city, promoted open
[2:49:17.300 --> 2:49:18.300]  borders.
[2:49:18.300 --> 2:49:23.020]  That's Democrat party policy is open borders, but they only want them in Texas and Arizona
[2:49:23.020 --> 2:49:24.740]  and Montana.
[2:49:24.740 --> 2:49:29.100]  And so when our governor of Texas, Greg Abbott said, hey, we don't, we can't afford these
[2:49:29.100 --> 2:49:30.100]  illegal immigrants here.
[2:49:30.100 --> 2:49:31.860]  You've already overwhelmed our communities.
[2:49:31.860 --> 2:49:33.060]  This is ridiculous.
[2:49:33.060 --> 2:49:34.380]  Sends them to New York City.
[2:49:34.380 --> 2:49:35.380]  And then what does the mayor say?
[2:49:35.380 --> 2:49:39.020]  He says, hey, we can't handle these illegal immigrants.
[2:49:39.020 --> 2:49:43.780]  New York City mayor warns everyone's block is going to be impacted by influx of illegal
[2:49:43.780 --> 2:49:45.380]  aliens.
[2:49:45.380 --> 2:49:53.100]  And so we've got all the clips of him complaining about the illegal immigrants.
[2:49:53.100 --> 2:49:55.140]  We've got all the clips about him complaining.
[2:49:55.140 --> 2:49:56.140]  It's too much.
[2:49:56.140 --> 2:49:57.140]  We can't handle it.
[2:49:57.140 --> 2:49:58.140]  We can't afford it.
[2:49:58.140 --> 2:49:59.140]  Our communities are suffering.
[2:49:59.140 --> 2:50:02.700]  But wait, that's your policy.
[2:50:02.700 --> 2:50:07.940]  That's the Democrat party policy is open borders and illegal immigrants.
[2:50:07.940 --> 2:50:11.780]  And then you made your cities sanctuary cities.
[2:50:11.780 --> 2:50:15.020]  And then when you actually suffer from your own policy, you complain.
[2:50:15.020 --> 2:50:19.220]  It's kind of like, oh, people vote Democrat in California.
[2:50:19.220 --> 2:50:21.020]  Then they hate Democrat party rules.
[2:50:21.020 --> 2:50:25.340]  So they leave California and move to Texas.
[2:50:25.340 --> 2:50:28.900]  So I'm not even sure which clip this is actually.
[2:50:28.900 --> 2:50:29.900]  I know that.
[2:50:29.900 --> 2:50:33.780]  But is this because I've got the clips, we've already played the clips of him complaining.
[2:50:33.780 --> 2:50:36.300]  I believe this is the clip of him now encouraging it.
[2:50:36.300 --> 2:50:39.100]  Is that correct?
[2:50:39.100 --> 2:50:43.940]  Because I already played all the clips of Adams saying how bad it is the illegal immigrant
[2:50:43.940 --> 2:50:46.220]  influx in New York City.
[2:50:46.220 --> 2:50:51.220]  All of a sudden he's changed his tune.
[2:50:51.220 --> 2:50:54.520]  And now he says it's time to get on board.
[2:50:54.520 --> 2:50:55.520]  So I don't even know.
[2:50:55.520 --> 2:50:57.740]  So which Eric Adams do we have in clip 12?
[2:50:57.740 --> 2:50:58.820]  Let's just let's play it.
[2:50:58.820 --> 2:51:00.300]  It's like the wild card.
[2:51:00.300 --> 2:51:05.380]  Which Eric Adams do we have in clip 12 pro illegal immigration or anti illegal immigration?
[2:51:05.380 --> 2:51:10.980]  Let's find out together and we can't have the historical.
[2:51:10.980 --> 2:51:16.180]  I believe people should be housed, but just don't house them on my block.
[2:51:16.180 --> 2:51:17.580]  Everyone blocked.
[2:51:17.580 --> 2:51:20.660]  Everyone's block is going to be impacted by this.
[2:51:20.660 --> 2:51:28.700]  And so we have to add our advocacy with our ability to help our neighbors.
[2:51:28.700 --> 2:51:33.660]  And we need everyone on board with this, you know, because as I stated last week, our schools
[2:51:33.660 --> 2:51:39.700]  are going to be impacted, our health care system is going to be impacted, our infrastructure
[2:51:39.700 --> 2:51:44.860]  is going to be impacted, but we're willing to do our job and we're going to do our job
[2:51:44.860 --> 2:51:48.260]  and we're going to need all New Yorkers to be with us on this.
[2:51:48.260 --> 2:51:54.380]  I just I don't even know where to how to even quantify this anymore.
[2:51:54.380 --> 2:51:56.140]  I mean, it's beyond stupidity.
[2:51:56.140 --> 2:51:57.340]  It's beyond hyperbole.
[2:51:57.340 --> 2:51:58.700]  It's beyond propaganda.
[2:51:58.700 --> 2:51:59.700]  It's beyond irony.
[2:51:59.700 --> 2:52:06.220]  I mean, it's it's on world, it's retardville.
[2:52:06.220 --> 2:52:09.380]  Democrats have the open border policy.
[2:52:09.380 --> 2:52:14.500]  Democrats have the sanctuary city policy and then they get illegal immigrants into their
[2:52:14.500 --> 2:52:18.340]  sanctuary cities from the open borders and they say, this is horrible.
[2:52:18.340 --> 2:52:19.540]  It's impacting us.
[2:52:19.540 --> 2:52:21.180]  It's impacting our communities.
[2:52:21.180 --> 2:52:22.780]  It's impacting our schools.
[2:52:22.780 --> 2:52:24.180]  We can't handle it.
[2:52:24.180 --> 2:52:28.860]  Well, where do you think the other five million illegal immigrants that you bring in a year
[2:52:28.860 --> 2:52:32.260]  are going?
[2:52:32.260 --> 2:52:36.420]  And here's the lesson yet again.
[2:52:36.420 --> 2:52:42.420]  It's not logic if it can't be applied universally.
[2:52:42.420 --> 2:52:45.300]  But actually what Eric Adams is saying now is the logic.
[2:52:45.300 --> 2:52:47.460]  We can't handle the illegal immigrants.
[2:52:47.460 --> 2:52:49.380]  You're 100% right.
[2:52:49.380 --> 2:52:52.740]  Now apply that logic to the country.
[2:52:52.740 --> 2:52:54.900]  Now apply that logic to the southern border.
[2:52:54.900 --> 2:52:57.440]  Oh, but they don't do that.
[2:52:57.440 --> 2:52:59.660]  They say how great it is all the illegal immigrants.
[2:52:59.660 --> 2:53:01.580]  They say how great it is having the open border.
[2:53:01.580 --> 2:53:03.660]  They say how much we need the illegal immigrants.
[2:53:03.660 --> 2:53:07.540]  Then they show up in their communities and they say, whoa, we can't handle this.
[2:53:07.540 --> 2:53:11.980]  Whoa, we don't want this.
[2:53:11.980 --> 2:53:14.420]  So actually Eric Adams logic is right.
[2:53:14.420 --> 2:53:16.780]  They can't handle the influx of illegal immigrants.
[2:53:16.780 --> 2:53:17.860]  It hurts the schools.
[2:53:17.860 --> 2:53:19.140]  It hurts the communities.
[2:53:19.140 --> 2:53:21.380]  It hurts the economy.
[2:53:21.380 --> 2:53:28.100]  Now, but that's the same logic that should be applied to the entire country.
[2:53:28.100 --> 2:53:29.780]  But they just don't want them in their communities.
[2:53:29.780 --> 2:53:32.020]  They just want them in Republican areas.
[2:53:32.020 --> 2:53:37.900]  They want them in red states hoping they can get them to vote Democrat.
[2:53:37.900 --> 2:53:41.700]  That's what it's really all about.
[2:53:41.700 --> 2:53:46.620]  And of course there's the money grubbers that take advantage of the open border industry
[2:53:46.620 --> 2:53:50.860]  as well that make millions of dollars having the government pay for all their hotels to
[2:53:50.860 --> 2:53:53.860]  be rented out for all the illegal immigrants to come in.
[2:53:53.860 --> 2:53:58.140]  Not to mention the companies that rent out all the tents and do all the infrastructure
[2:53:58.140 --> 2:54:03.180]  and construction to build all the illegal immigrant camps, which cost millions of dollars.
[2:54:03.180 --> 2:54:06.860]  I mean, we're just being robbed hand over foot.
[2:54:06.860 --> 2:54:12.300]  And Eric Adams goes from saying how bad it is all the illegal immigrants coming in.
[2:54:12.300 --> 2:54:14.060]  And then I guess someone got into his ear.
[2:54:14.060 --> 2:54:19.980]  Some Democrat got into his ear and said, hey, we're the ones promoting the open border policies.
[2:54:19.980 --> 2:54:23.460]  We take it easy on the illegal immigrant rhetoric and he says, oh, okay, sorry, I'll change
[2:54:23.460 --> 2:54:27.460]  my tune and says the illegal immigrants are great now.
[2:54:27.460 --> 2:54:30.180]  We all need to get on board.
[2:54:30.180 --> 2:54:31.380]  These people are all phonies.
[2:54:31.380 --> 2:54:32.380]  They're all frauds.
[2:54:32.380 --> 2:54:34.420]  By the way, I just saw that news story put on the screen.
[2:54:34.420 --> 2:54:37.380]  I guess this is just breaking.
[2:54:37.380 --> 2:54:46.940]  So you may remember the abortionist, the baby murderer, who covered up the rape of a little
[2:54:46.940 --> 2:54:53.100]  girl, but I guess didn't because she originally filed the report in, I guess it was in Indiana
[2:54:53.100 --> 2:54:54.100]  or Ohio.
[2:54:54.100 --> 2:54:55.100]  Then they said they didn't have the report.
[2:54:55.100 --> 2:54:56.100]  They were all kind of anomalies.
[2:54:56.100 --> 2:55:04.500]  Well, anyway, the individual who turned himself in for the alleged rape of that 10-year-old
[2:55:04.500 --> 2:55:12.060]  girl who the Democrats used as a pro-abortion propaganda pawn, he has pled not guilty.
[2:55:12.060 --> 2:55:17.740]  Now the mom of the girl, the supposed mom of the girl, I think they've done a DNA test,
[2:55:17.740 --> 2:55:23.100]  the supposed mom of the girl said that he didn't rape her even though he admitted to
[2:55:23.100 --> 2:55:26.180]  having sexual contact with her.
[2:55:26.180 --> 2:55:31.700]  So how do you admit to having sexual contact with a 10-year-old girl as a full grown adult
[2:55:31.700 --> 2:55:35.780]  male and then how do you plead not guilty to rape?
[2:55:35.780 --> 2:55:41.180]  I mean, do I have to spell it out for you?
[2:55:41.180 --> 2:55:45.060]  You paid someone to have sexual conduct with that 10-year-old girl?
[2:55:45.060 --> 2:55:47.220]  Do I really need to spell it out for you?
[2:55:47.220 --> 2:55:57.560]  But the neighbor claims that the alleged mother of the girl was dating that individual.
[2:55:57.560 --> 2:56:04.260]  So this just gets more sorted and more despicable as the story goes on.
[2:56:04.260 --> 2:56:07.620]  And by the way, that individual is an illegal immigrant.
[2:56:07.620 --> 2:56:09.180]  What is the status of the girl?
[2:56:09.180 --> 2:56:10.860]  What is the status of the mom?
[2:56:10.860 --> 2:56:15.300]  What has been uncovered here or what did they try to cover up?
[2:56:15.300 --> 2:56:20.780]  But see, they were so desperate for any propaganda to be pro-abortion.
[2:56:20.780 --> 2:56:28.780]  They were so desperate that they may have accidentally exposed, I mean, what, a child
[2:56:28.780 --> 2:56:32.220]  sex trafficking ring, an illegal immigrant sex trafficking ring, a human trafficking
[2:56:32.220 --> 2:56:33.220]  ring?
[2:56:33.220 --> 2:56:38.020]  I mean, what's going on here with an illegal immigrant living with the supposed mother
[2:56:38.020 --> 2:56:42.660]  of a 10-year-old girl who gets raped, gets pregnant, has an abortion?
[2:56:42.660 --> 2:56:46.260]  And then they say, well, I had sex with her, but I didn't rape her.
[2:56:46.260 --> 2:56:50.180]  So how does that go down?
[2:56:50.180 --> 2:56:55.340]  So are the open borders good or bad when this 27-year-old comes in here and rapes a 10-year-old
[2:56:55.340 --> 2:56:56.940]  girl, but apparently didn't rape her?
[2:56:56.940 --> 2:56:58.020]  So how is that not raped then?
[2:56:58.020 --> 2:56:59.020]  Did you pay for it?
[2:56:59.020 --> 2:57:00.020]  Was it mutual?
[2:57:00.020 --> 2:57:02.020]  What happens?
[2:57:02.020 --> 2:57:07.500]  Shock video, Feral Mob attacks French cops during arrest of migrant thief.
[2:57:07.500 --> 2:57:13.020]  Now this is an important story, folks, because you have to understand what goes on here.
[2:57:13.020 --> 2:57:19.740]  The illegal immigrants that come in mass and they form these communities, they don't fit
[2:57:19.740 --> 2:57:20.860]  in to society.
[2:57:20.860 --> 2:57:24.340]  They're never, what's the word I'm looking for on the tip of my tongue?
[2:57:24.340 --> 2:57:25.340]  They never assimilate.
[2:57:25.340 --> 2:57:26.340]  Thank you, crew.
[2:57:26.340 --> 2:57:27.900]  They never assimilate to society.
[2:57:27.900 --> 2:57:31.980]  So they form these communities where they just have their own stuff going on.
[2:57:31.980 --> 2:57:33.140]  They don't assimilate.
[2:57:33.140 --> 2:57:34.900]  And then one commits a crime.
[2:57:34.900 --> 2:57:40.060]  A cop comes in to arrest them, and since they're not part of the larger community in this case
[2:57:40.060 --> 2:57:44.100]  in France, they got their own community, so they try to kill that cop and free the criminal.
[2:57:44.100 --> 2:57:51.700]  The globalist great reset, or the war for the world is here, but humanity is not being

[3:00:05.660 --> 3:00:08.060]  So my time is extended here on the Alex Jones show.
[3:00:08.060 --> 3:00:10.660]  I will be still hosting the war room today.
[3:00:10.660 --> 3:00:13.580]  It's always fun doing the double doubles here.
[3:00:13.580 --> 3:00:16.860]  You know, our mayor, Steve Adler here is such a piece of crap.
[3:00:16.860 --> 3:00:25.260]  Again, if it's not logic, if it can't be applied universally, it's not logic.
[3:00:25.260 --> 3:00:32.180]  NPR reporting new untested abortion bans, untested abortion bans.
[3:00:32.180 --> 3:00:33.860]  They're acting like this is some sort of big deal folks.
[3:00:33.860 --> 3:00:34.860]  They're blowing out of proportion.
[3:00:34.860 --> 3:00:38.140]  Remember when they said people were dying from ivermectin overdose?
[3:00:38.140 --> 3:00:39.140]  Remember that?
[3:00:39.140 --> 3:00:40.660]  That was a lie.
[3:00:40.660 --> 3:00:43.940]  Now they're lying about these abortion stories.
[3:00:43.940 --> 3:00:48.380]  Untested abortion bans have made doctors unsure about treating some pregnancy complications.
[3:00:48.380 --> 3:00:49.740]  That's a lie.
[3:00:49.740 --> 3:00:54.780]  That's led to life threatening delays and trapped families in limbo of grief and helplessness.
[3:00:54.780 --> 3:00:57.100]  Folks, that's all a lie.
[3:00:57.100 --> 3:00:58.380]  It's simple.
[3:00:58.380 --> 3:00:59.900]  You can't have an abortion.
[3:00:59.900 --> 3:01:00.900]  That's it.
[3:01:00.900 --> 3:01:01.900]  There's no trickery.
[3:01:01.900 --> 3:01:03.020]  There's no confusion.
[3:01:03.020 --> 3:01:05.060]  It's all propaganda.
[3:01:05.060 --> 3:01:06.060]  But okay, fine.
[3:01:06.060 --> 3:01:08.180]  They claim, let's just say that's true.
[3:01:08.180 --> 3:01:13.340]  Okay, so now people are having things delayed because of the, they're unsure what the abortion
[3:01:13.340 --> 3:01:14.900]  laws are.
[3:01:14.900 --> 3:01:15.900]  It's a lie.
[3:01:15.900 --> 3:01:16.900]  But okay, fine.
[3:01:16.900 --> 3:01:17.900]  We'll play that game.
[3:01:17.900 --> 3:01:20.380]  Okay, so people's treatments are being delayed and that's such a horrible thing, right?
[3:01:20.380 --> 3:01:23.900]  So Mayor Adler says, this is a heartbreaking story.
[3:01:23.900 --> 3:01:24.900]  Abortion is healthcare.
[3:01:24.900 --> 3:01:28.740]  No, killing a baby is not healthcare, but that's not the point.
[3:01:28.740 --> 3:01:35.460]  Oh, now it's heartbreaking that people's surgeries are being delayed and it might be life-threatening.
[3:01:35.460 --> 3:01:40.180]  But when it was COVID, it was all good.
[3:01:40.180 --> 3:01:41.180]  See that?
[3:01:41.180 --> 3:01:42.180]  It's not logic.
[3:01:42.180 --> 3:01:44.020]  It's propaganda.
[3:01:44.020 --> 3:01:49.340]  So it's the worst thing ever now because of the abortion ban that some women aren't
[3:01:49.340 --> 3:01:52.300]  getting abortions or there's confusion.
[3:01:52.300 --> 3:01:54.140]  They're claiming there's confusion at the hospitals.
[3:01:54.140 --> 3:01:55.140]  They don't know.
[3:01:55.140 --> 3:01:57.300]  And it's causing life-threatening delays for surgeries.
[3:01:57.300 --> 3:02:00.580]  First of all, I don't believe that for a second, but let's say I do.
[3:02:00.580 --> 3:02:03.460]  Okay, so that's horrible.
[3:02:03.460 --> 3:02:10.180]  Surgeries are being delayed because of government policy and that's so heartbreaking to you.
[3:02:10.180 --> 3:02:14.340]  What about with COVID when people died because of delayed surgeries or people couldn't get
[3:02:14.340 --> 3:02:18.100]  a surgery or a life-saving treatment because they didn't get a vaccine?
[3:02:18.100 --> 3:02:19.460]  Was that so heartbreaking?
[3:02:19.460 --> 3:02:21.140]  Was that so bad or was that good?
[3:02:21.140 --> 3:02:22.580]  Oh, that was good.
[3:02:22.580 --> 3:02:23.580]  That's right.
[3:02:23.580 --> 3:02:24.580]  That was good.
[3:02:24.580 --> 3:02:26.300]  But now that it's over abortion, it's bad.
[3:02:26.300 --> 3:02:27.300]  I see.
[3:02:27.300 --> 3:02:29.660]  So you see, it's not logic.
[3:02:29.660 --> 3:02:32.900]  It's propaganda.
[3:02:32.900 --> 3:02:37.860]  And it just continues with these damn Democrats.
[3:02:37.860 --> 3:02:45.020]  Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, I'll tell you.
[3:02:45.020 --> 3:02:47.180]  I will tell you.
[3:02:47.180 --> 3:02:48.180]  Let's listen to what come all.
[3:02:48.180 --> 3:02:49.180]  You know what?
[3:02:49.180 --> 3:02:51.780]  I should say this because I got this whole stack of how they're sexualizing your kids
[3:02:51.780 --> 3:02:54.540]  in the classrooms that I'm going to cover on the war room.
[3:02:54.540 --> 3:02:58.060]  So I won't do that right now.
[3:02:58.060 --> 3:03:03.500]  But again, Fauci saying, I never called for a government shutdown.
[3:03:03.500 --> 3:03:07.340]  I never called for the country to be shut down.
[3:03:07.340 --> 3:03:13.340]  And then right after he makes that claim, he makes this claim in clip four.
[3:03:13.340 --> 3:03:19.260]  I want to get your take on a lot of people looking at the president now having this and
[3:03:19.260 --> 3:03:20.780]  all these people who have been fully.
[3:03:20.780 --> 3:03:21.780]  Yeah.
[3:03:21.780 --> 3:03:24.780]  They're going to go to clip four.
[3:03:24.780 --> 3:03:30.980]  Oh, I have a I have Fauci here for clip four.
[3:03:30.980 --> 3:03:33.980]  Was that Berks admitting that they knew the vaccine wouldn't work?
[3:03:33.980 --> 3:03:34.980]  All right.
[3:03:34.980 --> 3:03:35.980]  That's fine.
[3:03:35.980 --> 3:03:38.340]  We had a little we had a little miscommunication with the crew.
[3:03:38.340 --> 3:03:39.340]  Sorry.
[3:03:39.340 --> 3:03:41.020]  We already played the Fauci clip showing he's a liar.
[3:03:41.020 --> 3:03:44.820]  So here's Berks admitting, I mean, I guess he's doing the right thing now admitting
[3:03:44.820 --> 3:03:49.660]  that they lied about the vaccines on to get your take on a lot of people looking at the
[3:03:49.660 --> 3:03:51.580]  president now having this.
[3:03:51.580 --> 3:03:56.420]  And all these people who have been fully vax vaccinated and boosted and all of that.
[3:03:56.420 --> 3:03:57.500]  And they're getting it.
[3:03:57.500 --> 3:04:03.100]  The 20% or so of Americans who've not been vaccinated might look at that doctor and say,
[3:04:03.100 --> 3:04:04.260]  why bother?
[3:04:04.260 --> 3:04:05.260]  Why bother?
[3:04:05.260 --> 3:04:06.260]  What do you tell them?
[3:04:06.260 --> 3:04:11.340]  Well, if you're across the South and you're in the middle of this wave, what's going to
[3:04:11.340 --> 3:04:13.820]  save you right now is perhaps a little bit.
[3:04:13.820 --> 3:04:18.580]  But once we get through this wave during that law, you should get vaccinated and boosted
[3:04:18.580 --> 3:04:23.260]  because we do believe it will protect you, particularly if you're over 70.
[3:04:23.260 --> 3:04:27.740]  I knew these vaccines were not going to protect against infection and I think we overplayed
[3:04:27.740 --> 3:04:33.100]  the vaccines and it made people then worry that it's not going to protect against severe
[3:04:33.100 --> 3:04:34.100]  disease and hospitalization.
[3:04:34.100 --> 3:04:36.100]  Why are these people such frauds?
[3:04:36.100 --> 3:04:37.100]  All right.
[3:04:37.100 --> 3:04:38.100]  Take her down.
[3:04:38.100 --> 3:04:39.100]  Why are these people such frauds?
[3:04:39.100 --> 3:04:40.900]  So she admits they lied about the vaccine.
[3:04:40.900 --> 3:04:42.860]  She admits they knew it wasn't effective.
[3:04:42.860 --> 3:04:44.940]  And then she says, you need to go take it anyway.
[3:04:44.940 --> 3:04:46.300]  It's like the robotic response.
[3:04:46.300 --> 3:04:50.140]  Here's Senator Manchin now, this morning I tested positive for COVID-19.
[3:04:50.140 --> 3:04:53.660]  I am fully vaccinated and boosted and experiencing mild symptoms.
[3:04:53.660 --> 3:04:56.020]  I will isolate and follow CDC guidelines.
[3:04:56.020 --> 3:05:00.660]  If you're like myself and so many other people on this planet, especially as you get older,
[3:05:00.660 --> 3:05:02.660]  you gain weight even if you eat a lot less.
[3:05:02.660 --> 3:05:07.420]  I got to tell you, Info Wars is only about bringing you amazing products that really
[3:05:07.420 --> 3:05:08.420]  work.
[3:05:08.420 --> 3:05:11.740]  So we looked at the supplement market that we fund a lot of our operations with and
[3:05:11.740 --> 3:05:18.180]  we said, what are the best selling natural, healthy, anti-fat weight loss products that
[3:05:18.180 --> 3:05:19.180]  are out there?
[3:05:19.180 --> 3:05:23.940]  We went and looked at the top 10 and they all had the same ingredients in common that
[3:05:23.940 --> 3:05:24.940]  is in this product.
[3:05:24.940 --> 3:05:32.500]  But with our new product from X7 Diet Force, we got the very best concentrates of these
[3:05:32.500 --> 3:05:37.380]  known natural essences that's just two amazing things for your body.
[3:05:37.380 --> 3:05:41.980]  And so I've lost almost 40 pounds, I'm so a little bit overweight in the last three months
[3:05:41.980 --> 3:05:45.900]  and I've been doing it using Diet Force and also Exercise.
[3:05:45.900 --> 3:05:52.420]  Well now Diet Force is exclusively available right now at infowarstore.com, 40% off.
[3:05:52.420 --> 3:06:10.180]  At infowarstore.com, Diet Force, you need to take this product, it really works.
[3:06:10.180 --> 3:06:31.460]  All right, Alex Jones on his way to the studio, so Alex Jones on his way to the studio, that's
[3:06:31.460 --> 3:06:39.420]  coming up shortly here folks, just wow, I mean just, I'll tell you, there's no roller coaster,
[3:06:39.420 --> 3:06:47.340]  there's no thrill ride that can compete with the info war, let me just tell you that.
[3:06:47.340 --> 3:06:49.820]  And it is quite a ride.
[3:06:49.820 --> 3:06:54.500]  So Alex Jones on his way, in the meantime, quickly here, this is the latest John Bown
[3:06:54.500 --> 3:07:00.620]  report, you can find it at band.video, share those links folks, tell people about band.video,
[3:07:00.620 --> 3:07:03.540]  you know just quickly before we go to the report.
[3:07:03.540 --> 3:07:08.300]  And I've been so busy, I forgot to do this, but the event I spoke at on Sunday, when I
[3:07:08.300 --> 3:07:13.780]  go to these things, I like to just kind of, you know, muck it up with the crowd, and hang
[3:07:13.780 --> 3:07:17.100]  it out at the bar for a little bit afterwards, meeting people, shaking hands, telling stories
[3:07:17.100 --> 3:07:22.100]  and stuff, and I had multiple individuals come up to me and say how much they love my
[3:07:22.100 --> 3:07:28.060]  work and how much they appreciate my work, and they didn't even know about band.video,
[3:07:28.060 --> 3:07:29.900]  they didn't even know.
[3:07:29.900 --> 3:07:33.300]  And when I told them, I was like, hey, nothing's ever changed, I'm still on the air three
[3:07:33.300 --> 3:07:37.020]  hours a day, I'm still doing man on the street videos, like nothing's changed, they like,
[3:07:37.020 --> 3:07:42.100]  their eyes were like, oh, what, like they'd been missing out this whole time.
[3:07:42.100 --> 3:07:46.140]  So folks, you gotta tell your friends and family about band.video, now is the time,
[3:07:46.140 --> 3:07:50.580]  the awakening is on, people are dying for truth in media, they're dying for something
[3:07:50.580 --> 3:07:58.020]  they can resonate with that's real, that tells it like it is, that's why we built band.video.
[3:07:58.020 --> 3:08:01.540]  So let's not forget to spread those links, share those links, tell friends and family,
[3:08:01.540 --> 3:08:03.820]  ourselves included, band.video.
[3:08:03.820 --> 3:08:13.500]  So here's the latest report from John Bowne that you can find at band.video.
[3:08:13.500 --> 3:08:19.980]  Colorado U.S. Representative Jason Crowe recently warned at the Aspen security forum just what
[3:08:19.980 --> 3:08:25.940]  Infowars has been warning about for well over a decade since Google's YouTube CEO Susan
[3:08:25.940 --> 3:08:29.140]  Wojcicki founded the company 23andMe.
[3:08:29.140 --> 3:08:32.740]  To be clear, I think one of the things we're talking about here is that there are now weapons
[3:08:32.740 --> 3:08:38.300]  under development and developed that are designed to target specific people.
[3:08:38.300 --> 3:08:44.260]  That's what this is, where you can actually take someone's DNA, take their medical profile
[3:08:44.260 --> 3:08:49.460]  and you can target a biological weapon that will kill that person or take them off the
[3:08:49.460 --> 3:08:52.100]  battlefield or make them inoperable.
[3:08:52.100 --> 3:08:58.140]  You can't have a discussion about this without talking about privacy and commercial data
[3:08:58.140 --> 3:09:02.420]  and the protection of commercial data because expectations of privacy have degraded over
[3:09:02.420 --> 3:09:04.220]  the last 20 years.
[3:09:04.220 --> 3:09:06.820]  Young folks actually have very little expectation of privacy.
[3:09:06.820 --> 3:09:10.260]  That's what the polling and the data show.
[3:09:10.260 --> 3:09:14.500]  People will very rapidly fit into a cup and send it into 23andMe and get really interesting
[3:09:14.500 --> 3:09:16.220]  data about their background.
[3:09:16.220 --> 3:09:17.220]  And guess what?
[3:09:17.220 --> 3:09:22.500]  Their DNA is now owned by a private company and can be sold off without very little intellectual
[3:09:22.500 --> 3:09:24.940]  property protection or privacy protection.
[3:09:24.940 --> 3:09:29.780]  We don't have legal and regulatory regimes to deal with that.
[3:09:29.780 --> 3:09:33.620]  We have to have an open and public discussion and this is going to have to be a political
[3:09:33.620 --> 3:09:39.740]  discussion about what does the protection of health care information, DNA information
[3:09:39.740 --> 3:09:45.620]  and your data look like because that data is actually going to be procured and collected
[3:09:45.620 --> 3:09:48.660]  by our adversaries for the development of these systems.
[3:09:48.660 --> 3:09:55.540]  Also, if we look at food security and what can our adversaries do with biological weapons
[3:09:55.540 --> 3:10:02.100]  that are directed at our animal agriculture, at our agricultural sector, hoof and mouth
[3:10:02.100 --> 3:10:07.660]  disease, highly pathogenic avian influenza, African swine fever, all of these things have
[3:10:07.660 --> 3:10:13.940]  circulated around the globe but have targeted by an adversary, we know that it brings about
[3:10:13.940 --> 3:10:15.740]  food insecurity.
[3:10:15.740 --> 3:10:23.140]  Not only is 23andMe and similar DNA testing services a trap, it's likely that what they
[3:10:23.140 --> 3:10:26.660]  are sharing with you may not even be the correct results.
[3:10:26.660 --> 3:10:32.220]  I wanted to see what would happen if I sent my pet lizard DNA into 23andMe and so with
[3:10:32.220 --> 3:10:37.700]  the help of my wife, we extracted enough saliva to send off in the mail.
[3:10:37.700 --> 3:10:41.340]  After about three months, we were shocked.
[3:10:41.340 --> 3:10:47.780]  My lizard was 51% Ashkenazi Jewish, it was also 48% West Asian.
[3:10:47.780 --> 3:10:51.420]  DNA testing is central to the plans of the New World Order.
[3:10:51.420 --> 3:10:57.980]  We cannot hide away from human population growth because it underlies so many of the
[3:10:57.980 --> 3:10:58.980]  other problems.
[3:10:58.980 --> 3:11:04.620]  All these things we talk about wouldn't be a problem if there was the size of population
[3:11:04.620 --> 3:11:07.100]  that there was 500 years ago.
[3:11:07.100 --> 3:11:17.820]  Thanks also to the leadership of China in terms of fighting the pandemic, in terms of
[3:11:17.820 --> 3:11:24.820]  reinvigorating its economy, we have now a window of opportunity to create this global
[3:11:24.820 --> 3:11:27.420]  reset which we all need.
[3:11:27.420 --> 3:11:31.620]  Recent coronavirus testing added to the logging of Americans DNA.
[3:11:31.620 --> 3:11:38.380]  As natural news reported, foreign powers can collect, store and exploit biometric information
[3:11:38.380 --> 3:11:39.900]  from COVID tests.
[3:11:39.900 --> 3:11:45.740]  Reads a statement issued by Bill Evanina, director of the United States National Counterintelligence
[3:11:45.740 --> 3:11:47.540]  and Security Center.
[3:11:47.540 --> 3:11:52.540]  Evanina believes that Communist China is trying to collect Americans DNA in a race to control
[3:11:52.540 --> 3:11:54.060]  the world's bio data.
[3:11:54.060 --> 3:12:00.020]  He added that he thinks Chinese companies are actively investing in U.S.-based biotech
[3:12:00.020 --> 3:12:06.420]  companies to further the country's efforts to attain all human DNA, which brings it all
[3:12:06.420 --> 3:12:13.860]  back to hardcore biotech investor Google, who also tracks and records data on every U.S.
[3:12:13.860 --> 3:12:14.860]  citizen.
[3:12:14.860 --> 3:12:18.180]  If they have all of that, they have all of us.
[3:12:18.180 --> 3:12:25.020]  John Bound reporting.
[3:12:25.020 --> 3:12:30.340]  I wonder if you would recommend locking down schools if you had to do it all over again.
[3:12:30.340 --> 3:12:34.380]  All you have to do is check out what I'm saying and that's why they run the fake headline
[3:12:34.380 --> 3:12:39.220]  against myself and Tucker Carlson everywhere, every day.
[3:12:39.220 --> 3:12:45.500]  Jones admits he's an actor, or Tucker Carlson says nobody would take me seriously.
[3:12:45.500 --> 3:12:46.500]  Where do we say that?
[3:12:46.500 --> 3:12:47.500]  We never said that.
[3:12:47.500 --> 3:12:52.020]  They just say we said that, but where's the clip?
[3:12:52.020 --> 3:12:53.020]  Where's the article?
[3:12:53.020 --> 3:12:54.020]  Where do we say that?
[3:12:54.020 --> 3:12:55.020]  It doesn't exist.
[3:12:55.020 --> 3:12:59.820]  Alex Jones is playing a character and is a performance artist.
[3:12:59.820 --> 3:13:02.900]  Jones is playing a character on his radio show.
[3:13:02.900 --> 3:13:07.460]  The radio rants of Alex Jones are just an act.
[3:13:07.460 --> 3:13:09.580]  He's actually a performance artist.
[3:13:09.580 --> 3:13:11.180]  He's a performance artist.
[3:13:11.180 --> 3:13:13.100]  Alex Jones is a fake.
[3:13:13.100 --> 3:13:19.740]  They're lying to you because they think you're stupid and it's all based on a custody battle
[3:13:19.740 --> 3:13:24.500]  my ex-wife five years ago and she was trying to put into evidence of me dressed up more
[3:13:24.500 --> 3:13:29.380]  than a decade before like the Joker being sarcastic saying, take your Prozac kids, take
[3:13:29.380 --> 3:13:35.460]  your illegal drugs too, you'll die, it's fun, so people wouldn't take drugs.
[3:13:35.460 --> 3:13:39.340]  They wanted to enter that in evidence, they look, he's insane telling kids to use drugs
[3:13:39.340 --> 3:13:44.580]  and my lawyer went, when Jack Nicholson plays the part of the Joker, no one thinks that's
[3:13:44.580 --> 3:13:45.580]  really Jack Nicholson.
[3:13:45.580 --> 3:13:54.020]  So yeah, when I've been Cobra Commander, or Optimus Prime, or the Joker, because I can
[3:13:54.020 --> 3:14:01.620]  do imitations of them all really good, or Darth Vader, you didn't think you could silence
[3:14:01.620 --> 3:14:04.620]  the American people, did you?
[3:14:04.620 --> 3:14:06.260]  Do I really think I'm Darth Vader?
[3:14:06.260 --> 3:14:07.260]  No.
[3:14:07.260 --> 3:14:13.180]  Do I think I'm Optimus Prime, Cobra Commander, the Joker, no, and clearly no reasonable person
[3:14:13.180 --> 3:14:18.380]  would think when I'm doing satire that what I'm saying is what I really think.
[3:14:18.380 --> 3:14:23.100]  No one believes the Babylon Bee, it's not trying to lie to you, it's being sarcastic.
[3:14:23.100 --> 3:14:27.060]  By the vaccinate me on Modal today, it's required by the CDC.
[3:14:27.060 --> 3:14:32.140]  But they play those games and that's why I don't joke around as much as I used to.
[3:14:32.140 --> 3:14:36.660]  Even though I tell people, okay, this is a joke, this isn't serious, they clip it out
[3:14:36.660 --> 3:14:40.980]  and they say, no, this is what he really believes.
[3:14:40.980 --> 3:14:44.700]  Every day when I leave work, I do this, that man's a threat to this country.
[3:14:44.700 --> 3:14:46.820]  And they go, look, he admitted in court, he's an actor.
[3:14:46.820 --> 3:14:53.020]  Well, yeah, I was an actor in Scanner Darkly, I was an actor in Waking Life, I was an actor
[3:14:53.020 --> 3:14:56.540]  when I was Cobra Commander.
[3:14:56.540 --> 3:15:01.420]  But it doesn't mean that Alex Jones, the talk show host, up here reading news articles
[3:15:01.420 --> 3:15:06.460]  to you, isn't a real thing and isn't something I'm actually saying, and you know that, you're
[3:15:06.460 --> 3:15:11.980]  insulted right now, I'm even explaining that to you, and so am I, but that's who these
[3:15:11.980 --> 3:15:14.100]  people are.
[3:15:14.100 --> 3:15:18.420]  You don't know the power of the dark side.
[3:15:18.420 --> 3:15:20.020]  Am I really Darth Vader?
[3:15:20.020 --> 3:15:25.980]  I think Alex Jones seems really talented, he's smart, he's funny as hell, he's truly
[3:15:25.980 --> 3:15:26.980]  funny.
[3:15:26.980 --> 3:15:41.980]  Now that I've done those imitations, those little jokes, do you now not listen to what
[3:15:41.980 --> 3:15:46.940]  I say about other things when I show you a powerful news article by Dr. Joseph Mercola
[3:15:46.940 --> 3:15:52.940]  on infowars.com that has all the cited information, the latest tragedy, sudden adult death syndrome?
[3:15:52.940 --> 3:15:57.100]  No, that's a real thing.
[3:15:57.100 --> 3:16:02.220]  Several years ago, I approached one of the top companies in the U.S. that supplies the
[3:16:02.220 --> 3:16:07.420]  highest quality signature reducing Faraday cages, the Pentagon, and other U.S. government
[3:16:07.420 --> 3:16:13.900]  agencies, and now they have produced specifically for us this made in America onion line at

[3:16:24.740 --> 3:16:27.220]  you want to put in it like desktop computers.
[3:16:27.220 --> 3:16:33.660]  It is all exclusively available at infowars.com under the Redux name.

[3:20:41.940 --> 3:20:42.940]  hour.
[3:20:42.940 --> 3:20:44.940]  I'm going to be co-host in the war room with Owen Shroyer today.
[3:20:44.940 --> 3:20:45.940]  All right.
[3:20:45.940 --> 3:20:46.940]  I want to explain something.
[3:20:46.940 --> 3:20:47.940]  We got great reset.
[3:20:47.940 --> 3:20:48.940]  We got world government.
[3:20:48.940 --> 3:20:49.940]  We got collapsing borders.
[3:20:49.940 --> 3:20:52.380]  We got the left openly promoting pedophilia.
[3:20:52.380 --> 3:20:54.420]  We got them trying to confiscate our guns.
[3:20:54.420 --> 3:20:59.860]  We got total vindication of all the basics that we warned was coming in the future.
[3:20:59.860 --> 3:21:04.500]  But their kill shot, as they've called it, in trying to take us off the air and take
[3:21:04.500 --> 3:21:08.740]  everybody else off the air, was selective courts doing default judgments on talk show
[3:21:08.740 --> 3:21:13.940]  host and on publications where the judge says you're guilty and then never lets any
[3:21:13.940 --> 3:21:17.380]  of your evidence be presented to the jury only how you're guilty.
[3:21:17.380 --> 3:21:23.180]  No one's ever even seen this in a real case, okay, a default judgments where, again, somebody
[3:21:23.180 --> 3:21:27.580]  sues you and then you just run off and never even show up and never even respond.
[3:21:27.580 --> 3:21:32.940]  Instead, they got every ounce of discovery, everything about us, you name it.
[3:21:32.940 --> 3:21:36.660]  And then these judges, both the Connecticut and Texas said, you didn't give us stuff.
[3:21:36.660 --> 3:21:39.300]  We know you've got more.
[3:21:39.300 --> 3:21:42.460]  Just incredible stuff like, well, in your text messages, Jones, we didn't find this
[3:21:42.460 --> 3:21:46.980]  other text message that you gave to a producer and worked here in five years.
[3:21:46.980 --> 3:21:49.020]  Yeah, I don't know how to save stuff on my phone.
[3:21:49.020 --> 3:21:50.900]  I'm not a tech guy in the details.
[3:21:50.900 --> 3:21:52.620]  I know the overarching systems.
[3:21:52.620 --> 3:21:54.300]  But yeah, then they subpoenaed somebody else.
[3:21:54.300 --> 3:21:56.660]  They had some text messages and they were innocuous.
[3:21:56.660 --> 3:21:58.260]  They had them saved on their phone.
[3:21:58.260 --> 3:22:01.060]  I didn't have it saved on mine.
[3:22:01.060 --> 3:22:02.900]  Oh, you're defaulted for that.
[3:22:02.900 --> 3:22:06.820]  Oh, your corporate representative couldn't answer a question out of hundreds of thousands
[3:22:06.820 --> 3:22:08.220]  of emails we turned over.
[3:22:08.220 --> 3:22:10.340]  And so that's a million dollar fine.
[3:22:10.340 --> 3:22:13.380]  Just insane total weaponization.
[3:22:13.380 --> 3:22:19.020]  Great Tom delay, the Republican fundraiser did nothing wrong, Travis County, same courthouse
[3:22:19.020 --> 3:22:24.140]  indicted him, took him years to have the criminal conviction overturned.
[3:22:24.140 --> 3:22:30.540]  Same thing, ladies and gentlemen, with Rick Perry, the exact same thing with Rick Perry
[3:22:30.540 --> 3:22:36.660]  who vetoed a bill with Travis County corruption involved, which is the governor's right.
[3:22:36.660 --> 3:22:38.700]  And so they had him indicted.
[3:22:38.700 --> 3:22:43.340]  And let me tell you, when you sit there and you watch them try to deceive a jury.
[3:22:43.340 --> 3:22:47.540]  And the judge kept saying to the jury, remember, he's guilty.
[3:22:47.540 --> 3:22:48.780]  It's his fault.
[3:22:48.780 --> 3:22:49.780]  He's guilty.
[3:22:49.780 --> 3:22:52.740]  She said it at least four times the jury.
[3:22:52.740 --> 3:22:54.340]  It's his fault.
[3:22:54.340 --> 3:22:56.100]  He's guilty.
[3:22:56.100 --> 3:23:03.260]  Now you decide how guilty and about half the jury looked at me like I was Satan.
[3:23:03.260 --> 3:23:08.300]  Absolutely, absolutely Satan.
[3:23:08.300 --> 3:23:13.260]  And so they've got this setup.
[3:23:13.260 --> 3:23:14.460]  They've got this ready.
[3:23:14.460 --> 3:23:19.020]  And what's killing us is the general public's ignorance.
[3:23:19.020 --> 3:23:22.980]  Yeah, a lot of people are awake to the new world order.
[3:23:22.980 --> 3:23:34.500]  But their experts in leftist jurisdictions in sending out jury summons and hitting, let's
[3:23:34.500 --> 3:23:37.780]  just say this, extremely blue collar folks.
[3:23:37.780 --> 3:23:42.740]  I mean, half that jury panel does not know who I am.
[3:23:42.740 --> 3:23:44.620]  They said that.
[3:23:44.620 --> 3:23:49.900]  And when they were asked during the jury in paneling yesterday, do you believe the media
[3:23:49.900 --> 3:23:51.860]  has ever gotten anything wrong about Alex Jones?
[3:23:51.860 --> 3:23:54.660]  They all unanimously said no.
[3:23:54.660 --> 3:23:59.100]  So it's people do live in all these different bubbles and there's the bubbles that are awake
[3:23:59.100 --> 3:24:00.660]  and the bubbles that are questioning.
[3:24:00.660 --> 3:24:08.860]  But then there's the blue city bubbles where people do not know what planet they are on.
[3:24:08.860 --> 3:24:10.860]  And it's pretty incredible.
[3:24:10.860 --> 3:24:13.180]  And I don't want to spend all day on it.
[3:24:13.180 --> 3:24:17.820]  It's just to, as I was running around out in the parking lot, moving stuff into the
[3:24:17.820 --> 3:24:21.140]  office and changing clothes, it's 107 degrees out there and I broke out a big sweat.
[3:24:21.140 --> 3:24:25.100]  Somebody go to my office, just pretty pleased cupcakes on top and just get me one of my
[3:24:25.100 --> 3:24:29.500]  handkerchiefs that's sitting right there in my closet.
[3:24:29.500 --> 3:24:30.500]  Thank you so much.
[3:24:30.500 --> 3:24:33.020]  And just bring it to me, thanks.
[3:24:33.020 --> 3:24:37.020]  So that's where we are.
[3:24:37.020 --> 3:24:42.300]  And I actually was a little nervous about this and felt bad about how insane it all
[3:24:42.300 --> 3:24:47.020]  is and knew that 99% of what they were saying wasn't true, but I'm still not perfect.
[3:24:47.020 --> 3:24:54.100]  But now sitting there watching the cynical corruption and watching the manipulation right
[3:24:54.100 --> 3:24:59.380]  in front of me while they accuse me of being a mastermind of manipulation.
[3:24:59.380 --> 3:25:04.740]  And while they accuse me of being a mastermind that made all this money off Sandy Hook in
[3:25:04.740 --> 3:25:13.660]  our one exhibit, our one exhibit that we wanted to show was a graph of numbers off of discovery
[3:25:13.660 --> 3:25:18.100]  off the analytics that we're giving to them that less than one half of 1% of what we covered
[3:25:18.100 --> 3:25:22.940]  ever in the history of Info Wars was about Sandy Hook and that 95% of it was saying Sandy
[3:25:22.940 --> 3:25:27.500]  Hook happened and the judge said, no, you can't have your one piece of evidence and
[3:25:27.500 --> 3:25:32.660]  the other side can have whatever they want and they giggle and they laugh and they joke
[3:25:32.660 --> 3:25:36.180]  and they think it's funny.
[3:25:36.180 --> 3:25:45.660]  And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the cancer that is absolutely destroying our civilization.
[3:25:45.660 --> 3:25:46.660]  I'll get one.
[3:25:46.660 --> 3:25:52.340]  We'll be back in a little while.
[3:25:52.340 --> 3:25:56.340]  All you have to do is check out what I'm saying and that's why they run the fake headline
[3:25:56.340 --> 3:26:03.700]  against myself and Tucker Carlson everywhere, every day, Jones admits he's an actor or
[3:26:03.700 --> 3:26:07.460]  Tucker Carlson says nobody would take me seriously.
[3:26:07.460 --> 3:26:08.460]  Where do we say that?
[3:26:08.460 --> 3:26:09.460]  We never said that.
[3:26:09.460 --> 3:26:11.980]  They just say we said that.
[3:26:11.980 --> 3:26:13.980]  But where's the clip?
[3:26:13.980 --> 3:26:14.980]  Where's the article?
[3:26:14.980 --> 3:26:15.980]  Where do we say that?
[3:26:15.980 --> 3:26:16.980]  It doesn't exist.
[3:26:16.980 --> 3:26:21.740]  Alex Jones is playing a character and is a performance artist.
[3:26:21.740 --> 3:26:24.860]  Jones is playing a character on his radio show.
[3:26:24.860 --> 3:26:29.460]  The radio rants of Alex Jones are just an act.
[3:26:29.460 --> 3:26:31.540]  He's actually a performance artist.
[3:26:31.540 --> 3:26:33.060]  He's a performance artist.
[3:26:33.060 --> 3:26:35.060]  Alex Jones is a fake.
[3:26:35.060 --> 3:26:41.660]  They're lying to you because they think you're stupid and it's all based on custody battle
[3:26:41.660 --> 3:26:45.700]  with my ex-wife five years ago and she was trying to put into evidence to be dressed
[3:26:45.700 --> 3:26:51.340]  up more than a decade before like the Joker being sarcastic saying take your Prozac kids,
[3:26:51.340 --> 3:26:57.420]  take your illegal drugs too, you'll die, it's fun, so people wouldn't take drugs.
[3:26:57.420 --> 3:26:58.620]  And they wanted to enter that in evidence.
[3:26:58.620 --> 3:27:01.420]  They look, he's insane telling kids to use drugs.
[3:27:01.420 --> 3:27:06.580]  And my lawyer went, when Jack Nicholson plays the part of the Joker, no one thinks that's
[3:27:06.580 --> 3:27:07.580]  really Jack Nicholson.
[3:27:07.580 --> 3:27:15.060]  So yeah, when I've been Cobra Commander or Optimus Prime, Autobots, let's roll or the
[3:27:15.060 --> 3:27:19.100]  Joker because I can do imitations of them all really good or Darth Vader.
[3:27:19.100 --> 3:27:22.100]  Don't act so surprised, globalist.
[3:27:22.100 --> 3:27:26.620]  You didn't think you could silence the American people, did you?
[3:27:26.620 --> 3:27:28.620]  Do I really think I'm Darth Vader?
[3:27:28.620 --> 3:27:29.620]  No.
[3:27:29.620 --> 3:27:30.620]  Do I think I'm Optimus Prime?
[3:27:30.620 --> 3:27:32.500]  Cobra Commander, the Joker, no.
[3:27:32.500 --> 3:27:38.540]  And clearly no reasonable person would think when I'm doing satire that what I'm saying
[3:27:38.540 --> 3:27:40.340]  is what I really think.
[3:27:40.340 --> 3:27:45.100]  No one believes the Babylon Bee, it's not trying to lie to you, it's being sarcastic.
[3:27:45.100 --> 3:27:49.100]  Why the vaccinate me on Modal today, it's required by the CDC.
[3:27:49.100 --> 3:27:54.140]  But they play those games, and that's why I don't joke around as much as I used to.
[3:27:54.140 --> 3:27:58.660]  Even though I tell people, okay, this is a joke, this isn't serious, they clip it out
[3:27:58.660 --> 3:28:02.980]  and they say, no, this is what he really believes.
[3:28:02.980 --> 3:28:04.980]  Every day when I leave work, I do this.
[3:28:04.980 --> 3:28:06.500]  That man's a threat to this country.
[3:28:06.500 --> 3:28:09.060]  And they go, look, he admitted in court, he's an actor.
[3:28:09.060 --> 3:28:15.060]  Well yeah, I was an actor in Scanner Darkly, I was an actor in Waking Life, I was an actor
[3:28:15.060 --> 3:28:18.540]  when I was Cobra Commander.
[3:28:18.540 --> 3:28:23.540]  But it doesn't mean that Alex Jones, the talk show host, up here reading news articles to
[3:28:23.540 --> 3:28:28.460]  you isn't a real thing, and isn't something I'm actually saying, and you know that.
[3:28:28.460 --> 3:28:34.020]  You're insulted right now, I'm even explaining that to you, and so am I, but that's who these
[3:28:34.020 --> 3:28:36.140]  people are.
[3:28:36.140 --> 3:28:39.260]  You don't know the power of the dark side.
[3:28:39.260 --> 3:28:47.300]  By the way, folks, I just got in here a minute ago, and I'm all hyped up, and I got a ton
[3:28:47.300 --> 3:28:51.900]  of stuff to cover, not just about the destruction of our freedoms through the weaponized judiciary,

[3:30:56.580 --> 3:31:01.940]  The globalists are fighting around the clock to destroy the family, to destroy heterosexual
[3:31:01.940 --> 3:31:06.540]  relationships, to annihilate our marriages and the studies are all clear.
[3:31:06.540 --> 3:31:13.180]  The number one cause of marital splits is that there's problems in the bedroom and the number
[3:31:13.180 --> 3:31:16.900]  one issue men have is erectile dysfunction.
[3:31:16.900 --> 3:31:20.540]  Ladies and gentlemen, the left makes big jokes about this because they don't want people
[3:31:20.540 --> 3:31:25.380]  having lasting good love and relationships, they want to break up society and we are so

[3:32:01.940 --> 3:32:06.460]  flat footed because of info wars and because of your support.
[3:32:06.460 --> 3:32:11.100]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is now more important than ever as we reach the critical heart of
[3:32:11.100 --> 3:32:16.380]  the battle that you spread the word and that you support liberty and that you warn people
[3:32:16.380 --> 3:32:19.020]  like you've never done before.
[3:32:19.020 --> 3:32:23.540]  We have come so far together, please help keep us from the year, we're under massive
[3:32:23.540 --> 3:32:27.460]  attack right now but we're going to win with your help, we're going to overcome this with
[3:32:27.460 --> 3:32:29.740]  your help and with God's blessing.

[3:32:34.420 --> 3:32:41.020]  gone into this, the great reset and the war for the world available right now at infoworksdoor.com.
[3:32:41.020 --> 3:32:43.700]  There's also signed copies available as well.
[3:32:43.700 --> 3:32:47.100]  We've got a lot of other big projects we're working on that are about to start launching
[3:32:47.100 --> 3:32:51.700]  as well but this is the cavalry because we need the funding and you need this book because
[3:32:51.700 --> 3:32:54.060]  it warns the world of the globalist plan.
[3:32:54.060 --> 3:32:57.860]  Get the great reset at infoworksdoor.com.
[3:32:57.860 --> 3:33:13.980]  Leading of frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:33:13.980 --> 3:33:18.820]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[3:33:18.820 --> 3:33:24.820]  Live from Freedom Command Central, it's the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:24.820 --> 3:33:36.340]  We're beginning to believe that a vaccine against AIDS may be impossible to make and
[3:33:36.340 --> 3:33:38.500]  too dangerous to test.
[3:33:38.500 --> 3:33:44.220]  If you take it and then a year goes by and everybody's fine, then you say, okay, that's
[3:33:44.220 --> 3:33:45.220]  good.
[3:33:45.220 --> 3:33:48.820]  Now let's give it to 500 people and then a year goes by and everything's fine.
[3:33:48.820 --> 3:33:53.580]  Say, well, now let's give it to thousands of people and then you find out that it takes
[3:33:53.580 --> 3:33:57.900]  12 years for all hell to break loose and then what have you done?
[3:33:57.900 --> 3:34:04.580]  The most up-to-date information daily, you can trust us as a source of that information.
[3:34:04.580 --> 3:34:09.180]  You can also trust the Director-General of Health and the Ministry of Health.
[3:34:09.180 --> 3:34:15.580]  For that information, do feel free to visit at any time to clarify any rumor you may hear.
[3:34:15.580 --> 3:34:21.540]  COVID-19.govt.nz, otherwise dismiss anything else.
[3:34:21.540 --> 3:34:24.020]  We will continue to be your single source of truth.
[3:34:24.020 --> 3:34:26.860]  We will provide information frequently.
[3:34:26.860 --> 3:34:33.420]  We will share everything we can, everything you are, else you see, a grain of salt and
[3:34:33.420 --> 3:34:34.940]  so I really ask people to focus on that.
[3:34:34.940 --> 3:34:38.180]  So let's give you just an example of that, it appears to be this text which originated
[3:34:38.180 --> 3:34:42.300]  in Malaysia and has become a viral hoax in Australia and in New Zealand.
[3:34:42.300 --> 3:34:46.060]  How irresponsible is it the people that are sharing that news of a lockdown imminent in
[3:34:46.060 --> 3:34:47.060]  New Zealand?
[3:34:47.060 --> 3:34:48.060]  Yeah.
[3:34:48.060 --> 3:34:51.860]  And look, that's the kind of thing that adds to the anxiety that people feel.
[3:34:51.860 --> 3:34:58.460]  So I continue to share the message, New Zealanders must prepare, but do not panic, prepare.
[3:34:58.460 --> 3:35:04.260]  And when you see those messages, remember that unless you hear it from us, it is not
[3:35:04.260 --> 3:35:05.260]  the truth.
[3:35:05.260 --> 3:35:13.300]  And I really ask people, just visit COVID-19.govt.nz, it has all of the up-to-date information
[3:35:13.300 --> 3:35:16.180]  and we will continue to provide everything you need.
[3:35:16.180 --> 3:35:22.020]  They expect to have a world government in which they are in control.
[3:35:22.020 --> 3:35:25.940]  Where he went into the stacks at the UN, actually got the documents, in the 60s of the Club
[3:35:25.940 --> 3:35:31.220]  of Rome meetings where they said, we're going to promote homosexuality, we're going to promote
[3:35:31.220 --> 3:35:36.220]  humans being sexless, that's also in Brave New World, 1932, people say, how did he predict
[3:35:36.220 --> 3:35:37.220]  so much?
[3:35:37.220 --> 3:35:40.540]  Well, honestly, before he died in 61, he wrote a book about it, Brave New World Revisited,
[3:35:40.540 --> 3:35:45.500]  Nonfiction, said, no, this is an actual plan hatched by the British Empire model that was
[3:35:45.500 --> 3:35:52.900]  commissioned by Sir Francis Galton in 1855 with the Royal Commission.
[3:35:52.900 --> 3:35:58.580]  So we're living in a royal commission where the British Empire said, we want biometrics,
[3:35:58.580 --> 3:36:03.900]  we want things called computers, and we want to be able to learn the secrets of the human
[3:36:03.900 --> 3:36:10.260]  genome, and we want to be able to program humans to basically be manufactured in factories.
[3:36:10.260 --> 3:36:15.100]  And you're like, wait a minute, they didn't discover the DNA until the 40s?
[3:36:15.100 --> 3:36:16.260]  No they didn't, folks.
[3:36:16.260 --> 3:36:21.260]  The double helix, the ancient Sumerian text, Babylonian and Egyptian and Greek, there's
[3:36:21.260 --> 3:36:23.340]  two stacks intertwined.
[3:36:23.340 --> 3:36:30.340]  They actually, Galton invented biometrics, invented the idea of computers, and they
[3:36:30.340 --> 3:36:35.700]  had hidden knowledge going back, they play-doted and published, they held on to, about advanced
[3:36:35.700 --> 3:36:38.140]  civilization that was here before.
[3:36:38.140 --> 3:36:43.060]  And they had maps of the world, and they knew all that stuff, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:36:43.060 --> 3:36:48.980]  They just kept the public dumb because they didn't want the public to understand it and
[3:36:48.980 --> 3:36:54.820]  know it, and then Christians with the Gutenberg press and the printing press began the Renaissance
[3:36:54.820 --> 3:36:59.620]  550 years ago, and the New World Order has been playing catch-up and trying to suppress
[3:36:59.620 --> 3:37:02.220]  it ever since then.
[3:37:02.220 --> 3:37:10.420]  So we in Aitley see movies with robots and spaceships, and it feels so familiar.
[3:37:10.420 --> 3:37:16.700]  It feels so yesterday because it's epigenetics, ladies and gentlemen, that this planet is
[3:37:16.700 --> 3:37:20.260]  not the first rodeo.
[3:37:20.260 --> 3:37:21.260]  And that's what they know.
[3:37:21.260 --> 3:37:23.820]  They don't laugh at this, they all know that.
[3:37:23.820 --> 3:37:31.260]  And so it's here, the second Atlantis, and you know how Atlantis ended.
[3:37:31.260 --> 3:37:33.260]  Yes.
[3:37:33.260 --> 3:37:38.220]  Tuesday live, globalists scrambled to shut down alternative media before masses learned
[3:37:38.220 --> 3:37:43.180]  how to stop the great reset, Owen Schreuer doing a great job hosting today, I will continue
[3:37:43.180 --> 3:37:49.420]  to co-host with him at least for several hours of the war room that's coming up in 23 minutes
[3:37:49.420 --> 3:37:50.420]  from now.
[3:37:50.420 --> 3:37:57.140]  We will open the phones up as well, but I want to be very clear about something.
[3:37:57.140 --> 3:38:01.180]  We are winning, ladies and gentlemen, and so that's why the establishment is taking
[3:38:01.180 --> 3:38:04.180]  the gloves off, taking the mask off, and it's going all the way.
[3:38:04.180 --> 3:38:07.500]  Here's a great example of this.
[3:38:07.500 --> 3:38:11.860]  Alex Jones, the great reset book, rockets to top of the Amazon charts, number one in
[3:38:11.860 --> 3:38:18.340]  history, number one in movers and shakers, maybe look at the statistics on the article
[3:38:18.340 --> 3:38:21.420]  on infowars.com.
[3:38:21.420 --> 3:38:25.300]  It shows the numbers right there, it shows how we're number one in history, I think the
[3:38:25.300 --> 3:38:34.580]  left likes that, ahead of Yuval Harari's anti-human pro-great reset New World Order book.
[3:38:34.580 --> 3:38:39.060]  It was 64,000 on the charts, the day it began presale.
[3:38:39.060 --> 3:38:49.180]  A week later, it's 76 in the world, up 85,053 places.
[3:38:49.180 --> 3:38:53.180]  That sales rank in the world is number 76 on the biggest chart there is.
[3:38:53.180 --> 3:38:59.820]  We're going to push that to number one, Alex's war is number two in the world for presales.
[3:38:59.820 --> 3:39:02.860]  It comes out on the 29th.
[3:39:02.860 --> 3:39:06.740]  Now this isn't about Alex Jones bragging, it's about the power of the people and what
[3:39:06.740 --> 3:39:07.740]  they want.
[3:39:07.740 --> 3:39:09.340]  It's very specific as well.
[3:39:09.340 --> 3:39:14.140]  We get no money from Alex's war except for the DVDs we've bought that start shipping
[3:39:14.140 --> 3:39:15.140]  on Friday.
[3:39:15.140 --> 3:39:18.020]  We have a stockpile of them, you know what you have in your archive, you can fund us
[3:39:18.020 --> 3:39:19.940]  and keep us on air in this critical fight.
[3:39:19.940 --> 3:39:24.180]  The book, I'll probably get a couple dollars a book from, from the publisher and then we'll
[3:39:24.180 --> 3:39:27.740]  get about half the sales from sales at infowars.com.
[3:39:27.740 --> 3:39:33.500]  So I'd like you to get it or a signed copy at infowars.com, but it's a catch 22 because
[3:39:33.500 --> 3:39:38.100]  I want to go to number one in the world even though we'll make a lot less money.
[3:39:38.100 --> 3:39:42.180]  I want our book to be number one because what that does is the fake intellectuals and the
[3:39:42.180 --> 3:39:47.540]  Klaus Schwab's and all this scum that couldn't do anything even near that.
[3:39:47.540 --> 3:39:52.980]  I mean the people they celebrate and push the most go to the number one history section.
[3:39:52.980 --> 3:39:57.780]  We're in front of the high priest of the great reset right now and that's why they shake
[3:39:57.780 --> 3:40:07.020]  with hatred of us when they're around us and so I felt great that they packed the court
[3:40:07.020 --> 3:40:08.940]  with all these leftist in my enemies.
[3:40:08.940 --> 3:40:12.540]  I felt great when they were up there lying about me because it wasn't a sign of their
[3:40:12.540 --> 3:40:13.540]  strength.
[3:40:13.540 --> 3:40:18.540]  It was a sign of their weakness and if we have the time and the judge lets us show everything
[3:40:18.540 --> 3:40:23.540]  they said was a lie or a twisted fraud, but it made my head spin.
[3:40:23.540 --> 3:40:28.620]  Some of the crew was here watching it, all alone was on and I asked the producer Scott
[3:40:28.620 --> 3:40:32.340]  I said what were you able to say he said I just watched five minutes and I saw the judge
[3:40:32.340 --> 3:40:37.540]  and I saw this four times at least looks the jury and say he's guilty.
[3:40:37.540 --> 3:40:38.700]  I found him guilty.
[3:40:38.700 --> 3:40:44.100]  Well since when in America does a judge find you guilty and you heard his lawyer say that
[3:40:44.100 --> 3:40:49.260]  he actually apologized and said he thought Sandy Hook happened in 2015.
[3:40:49.260 --> 3:40:54.660]  Yeah, so what the judge actually said she came back from lunch and she told the jury
[3:40:54.660 --> 3:41:00.860]  that during your lawyer's opening statement he had mentioned that you had apologized several
[3:41:00.860 --> 3:41:06.460]  times and she told the jury that you have to strike that from the record that's stricken
[3:41:06.460 --> 3:41:11.340]  from the record and it's like why can't the jury know that you said you were sorry that
[3:41:11.340 --> 3:41:14.140]  doesn't seem like anything that would be normal.
[3:41:14.140 --> 3:41:15.140]  None of it is.
[3:41:15.140 --> 3:41:19.980]  Lawyers watching this all over the country top lawyers are on record saying this is worse
[3:41:19.980 --> 3:41:21.460]  than something Hitler would put on.
[3:41:21.460 --> 3:41:26.620]  I mean it's so one-sided this woman is known as a total tyrant she got elected into office
[3:41:26.620 --> 3:41:31.820]  just two years ago the Democrats even hate her she's George Soros funded and she would
[3:41:31.820 --> 3:41:37.100]  shake in hatred looking at me she has an HBO production crew there miking her up she all
[3:41:37.100 --> 3:41:42.340]  pimps for the camera the whole thing is rigged it is it is pathetic it's it's an indictment
[3:41:42.340 --> 3:41:48.220]  of them an indictment of rigged court systems and it will go down as the show trial of the
[3:41:48.220 --> 3:41:52.500]  century and if they succeed the show trial that began the model for the total takeover
[3:41:52.500 --> 3:41:57.860]  the world so I I left after lunch to come back to the office and do the show I didn't
[3:41:57.860 --> 3:42:05.420]  see that I saw her four times while I was there say let's be clear he is guilty and
[3:42:05.420 --> 3:42:09.380]  by the way remember she put an order out that I'm not allowed to say I'm innocent and then
[3:42:09.380 --> 3:42:13.780]  I talked to the press outside who's all there attacking me and I walked out and said I am
[3:42:13.780 --> 3:42:18.940]  not allowed to say I'm innocent I am innocent and this is all a setup and she blew up then
[3:42:18.940 --> 3:42:25.540]  and said you can't talk to the press out there I mean what did you make of this Scott I just
[3:42:25.540 --> 3:42:32.020]  think it's pretty pretty glaring and a great a great disrespect to what the judicial system
[3:42:32.020 --> 3:42:39.580]  supposed to be it seemed like every time that your your lawyer would say something it seemed
[3:42:39.580 --> 3:42:44.140]  like the judge would come in and have something wrong with it whereas anytime their lawyer
[3:42:44.140 --> 3:42:49.260]  was saying something everything was okay and it didn't matter what they were what you know
[3:42:49.260 --> 3:42:53.220]  what their lawyer was saying but your lawyer was always under these constraints hey you're
[3:42:53.220 --> 3:43:06.980]  not allowed to say there's Scott we'll be right back ladies and gentlemen it is now
[3:43:06.980 --> 3:43:12.900]  more important than ever as we reach the critical heart of the battle that you spread the word
[3:43:12.900 --> 3:43:18.700]  and that you support liberty and that you warn people like you've never done before we have

[3:47:12.540 --> 3:47:24.220]  Coleman I should have brought a notepad and paper today during the lies some of the crew
[3:47:24.220 --> 3:47:28.580]  was watching just what they saw was flabbergasting and Scott our main producer was just saying
[3:47:28.580 --> 3:47:31.900]  what he just saw after they came back from lunch I mean I'm not going to sit there the
[3:47:31.900 --> 3:47:36.780]  whole time I got to be on air and by the globalist their goals to get us off air but again the
[3:47:36.780 --> 3:47:45.580]  judge says I'm guilty and the judge says that I must pay and the judge says you're not allowed
[3:47:45.580 --> 3:47:51.340]  to hear that he ever said he thought Sandy Hook happened even though I said at the beginning
[3:47:51.340 --> 3:47:55.380]  I thought it might happen and barely ever even covered it and so Scott saw them we're
[3:47:55.380 --> 3:48:04.100]  going to get the clip before the break saying that oh that's another thing she said she
[3:48:04.100 --> 3:48:10.060]  looked at us she said everyone else is allowed to use video from here but you're not you
[3:48:10.060 --> 3:48:14.940]  don't even get to present evidence no no no she said we can't she goes no one's allowed
[3:48:14.940 --> 3:48:21.980]  to show footage in here except any media I authorized and she's like you're not authorized
[3:48:21.980 --> 3:48:28.060]  that's the level these people just imagine the crazed animal level of this and she said
[3:48:28.060 --> 3:48:34.620]  four times I saw before lunch he is guilty you understand jury he is guilty and then
[3:48:34.620 --> 3:48:39.660]  my lawyer goes we're going to present evidence of all the times that he was actually having
[3:48:39.660 --> 3:48:44.420]  debates about this and and said he believed they died because they said for 10 years straight
[3:48:44.420 --> 3:48:50.700]  he says every day these kids haven't died and he attacks this man and this woman by name
[3:48:50.700 --> 3:48:55.300]  ever said their name you said their name once and they sued you and and and then they dropped
[3:48:55.300 --> 3:49:00.420]  you this recently so folks this is next level I mean I'm listening to it and it's basically
[3:49:00.420 --> 3:49:05.620]  all lies are twisted edited clips and I'm sitting there watching this and I can't believe
[3:49:05.620 --> 3:49:11.660]  I'm in a trafecta of their lawyers the judge and the media and they think it's funny and
[3:49:11.660 --> 3:49:18.580]  all they're trying to do is manipulate and deceive that jury and when you sit back and
[3:49:18.580 --> 3:49:24.100]  you see it for yourself up close and they're saying you're the one that does that and that
[3:49:24.100 --> 3:49:28.900]  everything Jones does is calculated massively and organized with all his people when we're
[3:49:28.900 --> 3:49:32.420]  the opposite of that we do research and give you are just open take on things which is
[3:49:32.420 --> 3:49:37.980]  our first one right so Scott finish up any points you had it was it's just a real shock
[3:49:37.980 --> 3:49:43.620]  that that this is allowed to happen particularly in Texas you would you would think that you
[3:49:43.620 --> 3:49:48.100]  know I've always thought Texas was kind of like the last bastion for freedom type thing
[3:49:48.100 --> 3:49:52.740]  and the fact that there is a court that just allows us to happen that that allows a judge
[3:49:52.740 --> 3:49:58.120]  just to without any sort of trial without any sort of presentation of evidence to your
[3:49:58.120 --> 3:50:05.860]  peers determines you're guilty that's really weird to me add in the fact that you know you
[3:50:05.860 --> 3:50:11.220]  went through all your discovery stuff and they can't tell you what you didn't produce
[3:50:11.220 --> 3:50:15.580]  but they just know you didn't produce what they needed and and that's always weird to
[3:50:15.580 --> 3:50:23.380]  me too it's just it's sad that this is allowed to happen and they threw out a number today
[3:50:23.380 --> 3:50:28.900]  that was like so astronomical hundred and fifty million how how did they do how did
[3:50:28.900 --> 3:50:35.340]  they come to that to do all do you know what what where did they get that number and how
[3:50:35.340 --> 3:50:40.180]  is that even possible that they they judge says you're guilty because judges aside not
[3:50:40.180 --> 3:50:44.940]  jury's now now she says he's guilty and then my lawyer says actually he's been saying he
[3:50:44.940 --> 3:50:48.820]  thought this happened for many many years the judges strike that you can't say that even
[3:50:48.820 --> 3:50:53.020]  though it's a fact and it's videos they've got an evidence and we've got an evidence
[3:50:53.020 --> 3:50:57.260]  but every time he's allowed to use the same evidence but edited we're not allowed to show
[3:50:57.260 --> 3:51:04.420]  the full tape that's that's that's is a well-known doctrine that you've got to show something
[3:51:04.420 --> 3:51:09.220]  in its entirety thank you so much for the comments Scott oh and this is a lot bigger
[3:51:09.220 --> 3:51:13.340]  than us this is about everybody well exactly and that's why I was going to say strip away
[3:51:13.340 --> 3:51:21.260]  the names strip away the faces strip away the politics and really just go base level
[3:51:21.260 --> 3:51:28.460]  just just human psychology human interaction level what I see happening here is a bunch
[3:51:28.460 --> 3:51:34.660]  of people who are low lives trying to destroy somebody who's much greater than them again
[3:51:34.660 --> 3:51:39.260]  forget about the names forget about the faces forget about the politics you know as somebody
[3:51:39.260 --> 3:51:43.380]  that just likes to look at human psychology and human interaction communication that's
[3:51:43.380 --> 3:51:47.500]  that's kind of what this looks like and that's what this feels like and I think that's why
[3:51:47.500 --> 3:51:56.060]  the the whole goblin-esque demeanor is so apparent here sadly just like with the censorship
[3:51:56.060 --> 3:52:03.260]  issue I'm afraid that Alex Jones fate in this case will ultimately be the fate of the next
[3:52:03.260 --> 3:52:07.140]  person and the next person and then the next group of people and then the next bigger group
[3:52:07.140 --> 3:52:13.860]  of people just like what we saw with censorship so Alex Jones gets censored okay people people
[3:52:13.860 --> 3:52:17.740]  bought into the lies about him and they said okay fine let's censor Alex Jones maybe that's
[3:52:17.740 --> 3:52:21.780]  not a bad thing oh well then they censored Donald Trump then they censored Roger Stone
[3:52:21.780 --> 3:52:25.740]  then they censored Marjorie Taylor and tens of thousands of doctors yeah and now all the
[3:52:25.740 --> 3:52:30.380]  doctors and now they're charging doctors for January 6 putting them in jail for 60 days
[3:52:30.380 --> 3:52:37.100]  so we're either Alex we're either at the beginning and these are the signs we're either at the
[3:52:37.100 --> 3:52:43.980]  beginning of a dystopian tyrannical takeover in the United States that's going to be cemented
[3:52:43.980 --> 3:52:49.940]  or we're at the end of the corrupt America regime that's controlled the media controlled
[3:52:49.940 --> 3:52:54.100]  the judicial system controlled everything else and these are their final kind of death
[3:52:54.100 --> 3:53:00.100]  rows as their corruption is getting exposed so so we either are going into a period of
[3:53:00.100 --> 3:53:08.620]  darkness into a period of oppression or we're going to end the remnants of the American regime
[3:53:08.620 --> 3:53:14.100]  and their oppression on the West their destruction of America and their complete sabotage of our
[3:53:14.100 --> 3:53:18.820]  judicial system our media and everything absolutely well I mean I'll tell us just what what the
[3:53:18.820 --> 3:53:23.580]  right thing to do is people should be protesting the judicial tyranny they should be out there
[3:53:23.580 --> 3:53:30.620]  from 830 in the morning until about 10 they should be out there you know when the one
[3:53:30.620 --> 3:53:35.740]  shower breaks at like you know noon or one they should be out there like five o'clock
[3:53:35.740 --> 3:53:40.980]  when it lets out the the independent media should be there and should be covering the
[3:53:40.980 --> 3:53:46.580]  real issues and I'll be down there doing press conferences every single day and and I'll
[3:53:46.580 --> 3:53:50.940]  announce times I'm going to be out there and we need people out there with sandwich boards
[3:53:50.940 --> 3:53:59.020]  and signs basically saying kangaroo court rigged you know judges can't find you guilty
[3:53:59.020 --> 3:54:03.940]  bring back jury trials because they're all betting on keeping that jury from knowing
[3:54:03.940 --> 3:54:09.540]  that and again for those that don't know a default is if here's an example there's they're
[3:54:09.540 --> 3:54:14.340]  very very rare they even call them unconstitutional most of the time that I mean no one even dares
[3:54:14.340 --> 3:54:22.940]  them it's when say somebody robbed a bank and and then they put that money in a bank
[3:54:22.940 --> 3:54:28.700]  account and and the court's not a hundred percent sure that's the money out of the bank account
[3:54:28.700 --> 3:54:35.340]  that was stolen out of a bank and the person runs away to Monte Carlo but most money is
[3:54:35.340 --> 3:54:40.700]  left in the in the bank out in the US if they don't show up for the lawsuit saying that's
[3:54:40.700 --> 3:54:46.140]  the stolen goods that's mine and they don't respond they still then have a trial with
[3:54:46.140 --> 3:54:50.940]  a jury to decide well is that really money that was stolen out of a bank is that the
[3:54:50.940 --> 3:54:55.980]  same money we gave them everything we're there you don't you don't do default judgments but
[3:54:55.980 --> 3:55:00.380]  Democrats were learning are doing it all over the place or they're calling it similar
[3:55:00.380 --> 3:55:04.700]  things like Steve Bannon this got convicted for contempt of Congress because he exercised
[3:55:04.700 --> 3:55:07.820]  executive privilege which is on the books no one would ever even dare to have anybody
[3:55:07.820 --> 3:55:14.700]  that worked for a president before start to Congress Steve Bannon could not talk or had
[3:55:14.700 --> 3:55:18.740]  his lawyers ask questions at the trial and it was like well yeah the judge ruled he they
[3:55:18.740 --> 3:55:24.300]  couldn't cross-examine they couldn't cross-examine and the judge said the facts are already found
[3:55:24.300 --> 3:55:29.980]  that you're in contempt no discussion about executive privilege no discussion about past
[3:55:29.980 --> 3:55:35.020]  precedent or law just know you don't get a defense so it's the exact same thing Owen
[3:55:35.020 --> 3:55:39.420]  they have weaponized the judiciary and conservative and Christian judiciary's the left always
[3:55:39.420 --> 3:55:43.980]  attacked they were the guardians of America they never did this this has never happened
[3:55:43.980 --> 3:55:49.620]  it's the left they are basically like courts in Venezuela this is why I spend so much
[3:55:49.620 --> 3:55:55.580]  time harping on the psychology of the liberal Democrat left because it's so important to
[3:55:55.580 --> 3:56:03.660]  understand in cases like this where whatever whenever you're looking at a liberal Democrat
[3:56:03.660 --> 3:56:07.940]  far left liberal Democrat you have to understand whether they're a doctor whether they're a
[3:56:07.940 --> 3:56:12.380]  teacher whether they're a lawyer whether they're this that or the other thing the fact they're
[3:56:12.380 --> 3:56:19.100]  a liberal Democrat progressive is always the top priority so whatever the agenda is or
[3:56:19.100 --> 3:56:23.940]  whatever the operational procedure is for a liberal Democrat progressive that will always
[3:56:23.940 --> 3:56:30.420]  take top priority over them doing their job an example I always like to use is with doctors
[3:56:30.420 --> 3:56:35.500]  how do all these young boys end up prescribed to SSRI drugs which we now know never did
[3:56:35.500 --> 3:56:40.660]  anything for depression we always knew that how do all these young boys end up on SSRI
[3:56:40.660 --> 3:56:47.740]  drugs because liberal doctors that hate men and view western men as toxic masculinity lists
[3:56:47.740 --> 3:56:51.860]  they get a boy and I now admit that and now it's cut their penis and balls off so now
[3:56:51.860 --> 3:56:57.100]  this is a freaking cult so I'm gonna say this I am honored I hope I don't care I had no money
[3:56:57.100 --> 3:57:01.900]  anyways but they get a trillion dollar judgment these people have convicted themselves they're
[3:57:01.900 --> 3:57:05.580]  frauds and they're destroyed oh and I want you to come back with that line of reasoning
[3:57:05.580 --> 3:57:09.660]  you're gonna host cuz I'm gonna run around take for a few key items right now we gotta

[3:59:08.620 --> 3:59:12.220]  the system and they don't want the general public understanding this and knowing this
[3:59:12.220 --> 3:59:18.100]  so it's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody
