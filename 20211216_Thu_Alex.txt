[00:00.000 --> 00:27.440]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:27.440 --> 00:33.640]  It's Thursday, December 16th, 2021, and here's a short clip from the Infowars News Center
[00:33.640 --> 00:45.160]  Vault from 5.10 of last year, which is a reprogramming mutagen that goes into the nucleus
[00:45.160 --> 00:48.440]  of your cell and reprograms it.
[00:48.440 --> 00:53.000]  And they admit the trials, it kills a lot of the animals, they test it on, but that's
[00:53.000 --> 00:58.440]  okay because Bill Gates said, a month ago, we played the clip probably 30 times.
[00:58.440 --> 01:03.080]  He said, yeah, a lot of people are going to get sick and die, but it don't matter because
[01:03.080 --> 01:07.720]  you're going to take it.
[01:07.720 --> 01:13.320]  They got some new vaccines that go in and eat parts of your brain, but it feels so good.
[01:13.320 --> 01:17.840]  Yeah, you're not going to have to wait any more all year in the Nile.
[01:17.840 --> 01:19.320]  It's here now.
[01:19.320 --> 01:22.960]  Oh, and the globalists are Satan worshippers too.
[01:22.960 --> 01:29.320]  The pedophiles, well, of course they are because we got a transmission 2,000 years ago warning
[01:29.320 --> 01:30.320]  us.
[01:30.320 --> 01:39.720]  You see, there's not just devils in the universe, there's somebody a lot more powerful.
[01:39.720 --> 01:49.400]  And here we are, 18 months later, and it's all unfolding.
[01:49.400 --> 01:54.640]  Of course inoculations beginning around the world, lockdowns being reinstated and in places
[01:54.640 --> 02:01.640]  like New York and Los Angeles, permanent mask mandates, Oregon passed the law, permanent
[02:01.640 --> 02:06.080]  mask mandates, the sign of slavery, the sign of submission.
[02:06.080 --> 02:10.960]  And at Applebee's in New York, people being arrested for not having their vaccine passports
[02:10.960 --> 02:15.440]  and people being drug out of the Cheesecake Factory in New York.
[02:15.440 --> 02:20.360]  This is an image of the future, and now when you don't have a good credit score, a global
[02:20.360 --> 02:25.280]  social credit score, you can't buy or sell or have a job as well.
[02:25.280 --> 02:27.760]  That's the holy grail of this system.
[02:27.760 --> 02:28.760]  Let's play a couple clips.
[02:28.760 --> 02:34.840]  This first one is from arrest being made at Applebee's and we'll go to a nearby Cheesecake
[02:34.840 --> 02:35.840]  Factory.
[02:35.840 --> 02:52.320]  No more mandates, no more mandates, no more mandates, no more mandates.
[02:52.320 --> 03:16.320]  I'm telling you what they did in Russia, if you think of Russia as on the inside of the
[03:16.320 --> 03:30.360]  city of Moscow and Moscow, they tried to say, middle of last year, you can't come in here
[03:30.360 --> 03:36.600]  unless you've got a vaccine, and the Russians right through this year said no, took them
[03:36.600 --> 03:41.600]  six months, they had to end it because the establishment restaurants were going bankrupt,
[03:41.600 --> 03:45.040]  some of the establishment hotels, the Russians again just started going to smaller places
[03:45.040 --> 03:46.520]  and eating out the street.
[03:46.520 --> 03:47.760]  Same thing is happening in France.
[03:47.760 --> 03:53.480]  We've got to realize we're in a fight, we've got to realize that every time we say no,
[03:53.480 --> 03:56.080]  we get stronger, the enemy gets weaker.
[03:56.080 --> 03:58.800]  Every time you submit, the enemy gets stronger, we get weaker.
[03:58.800 --> 04:05.080]  It's like lifting weights or hiking or oil painting or learning how to run a machine
[04:05.080 --> 04:09.200]  shop or becoming a farmer or a rancher or learning how to use a firearm.
[04:09.200 --> 04:12.160]  The more you push back, the stronger you get.
[04:12.160 --> 04:16.200]  The more you submit, the more you fail.
[04:16.200 --> 04:18.720]  This is such a transmission today, wow.
[04:18.720 --> 04:22.280]  They're out in the open, they're preparing the new lock-downs, it's all happening here
[04:22.280 --> 04:27.360]  in the U.S. CDC issues, new hysterical grim forecast warning that weekly COVID cases will
[04:27.360 --> 04:33.480]  jump by 55% to 1.3 million by Christmas a day and the deaths will surge 73%.
[04:33.480 --> 04:36.920]  Well they know that because people are dying of A.D.E.
[04:36.920 --> 04:41.240]  They know exactly what this is doing and blood clots and microcarditis.
[04:41.240 --> 04:42.480]  It's all coming up.
[04:42.480 --> 04:46.040]  One hell of a Thursday worldwide transmission.
[04:46.040 --> 04:50.440]  I'm Alex Jones and we are here in the midst of the battle and thanks to you, we're still

[06:17.120 --> 06:21.400]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[06:21.400 --> 06:27.880]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[06:27.880 --> 06:36.640]  And we are live, we are broadcasting worldwide on this Thursday, December 16th, 2021 transmission.
[06:36.640 --> 06:47.240]  Alright, the ADL is demanding that Fox News remove any criticism of Soros, period, saying
[06:47.240 --> 06:53.880]  any criticism of Soros is anti-Semitic when speaking of the famous Nazi collaborator,
[06:53.880 --> 06:54.880]  George Soros.
[06:54.880 --> 06:59.080]  You cannot make up the hoodspot of that move.
[06:59.080 --> 07:07.680]  ADL demands Fox News censor comics, casting Soros as a puppet master for Fox News, except
[07:07.680 --> 07:15.600]  he's on record installing 800 plus DAs and district attorneys and over 20 of the nation's
[07:15.600 --> 07:17.920]  state attorney generals.
[07:17.920 --> 07:20.440]  I mean, he literally does it publicly.
[07:20.440 --> 07:25.480]  He installed both the county attorney, the district attorney in Austin, who were both
[07:25.480 --> 07:30.880]  admitted communists, and he's now installed the judges that are elected, including the
[07:30.880 --> 07:33.680]  one coming after us.
[07:33.680 --> 07:36.760]  On record, I mean, it's not even hidden.
[07:36.760 --> 07:41.520]  99% of the funding to the district attorney communists they put in last year that's so
[07:41.520 --> 07:46.240]  famous now, he lets armed robbers out of jail.
[07:46.240 --> 07:50.760]  He lets people, from mass shootings downtown that just spray bullets in the crowds, they're
[07:50.760 --> 07:51.920]  out of jail in three days.
[07:51.920 --> 07:54.000]  I mean, you cannot make this up.
[07:54.000 --> 07:58.080]  And then if you criticize George Soros, a monster that wants to overthrow our country
[07:58.080 --> 08:05.160]  and destabilize it through destabilization, wants to overthrow it, the ADL pops up to
[08:05.160 --> 08:07.160]  tell us, oh, you're all anti-Semitic?
[08:07.160 --> 08:09.880]  No, I'm just anti-tyrant.
[08:09.880 --> 08:12.480]  I'm anti-George Soros.
[08:12.480 --> 08:17.480]  And so we're going to be looking at that today, just incredible, and how that ties into all
[08:17.480 --> 08:21.520]  the rest of the race-baiting and what's happening with DeSantis coming out against critical
[08:21.520 --> 08:22.520]  race theory.
[08:22.520 --> 08:27.120]  That Soros funding, white people are inherently evil, let's have racial division, public
[08:27.120 --> 08:31.200]  schools everywhere are now segregating students again.
[08:31.200 --> 08:33.000]  This is evil.
[08:33.000 --> 08:37.000]  George Soros is evil, evil, evil.
[08:37.000 --> 08:42.000]  Now, when you see a headline of, oh, we put in 50 million here, 28 million there, that's
[08:42.000 --> 08:43.800]  from his foundations directly.
[08:43.800 --> 08:46.320]  He's got all these little subgroups under him.
[08:46.320 --> 08:49.600]  It's billions a year.
[08:49.600 --> 08:50.600]  The other's Politico.
[08:50.600 --> 08:53.840]  George Soros' quiet overhaul of the U.S. justice system.
[08:53.840 --> 08:58.680]  Well, if you don't like the remodeling job he's doing, the overhaul, if you don't like
[08:58.680 --> 09:04.120]  the positive piece over in Politico and you criticize it, well, you're bad and the head
[09:04.120 --> 09:07.800]  of the ADL will call for you to be censored, that's coming up.
[09:07.800 --> 09:14.200]  Huge COVID-19 news, martial law rollout, worse than we thought, moving quicker than we thought,
[09:14.200 --> 09:19.800]  Biden giggling and laughing saying he'll win no matter what in 2022 in the midterms and
[09:19.800 --> 09:24.560]  coming up in 2024 because he knows they've got the election fraud in place.
[09:24.560 --> 09:26.240]  So don't be too confident out there, folks.
[09:26.240 --> 09:31.320]  I told you last year, I told you they were going to steal the election bigger than Dallas
[09:31.320 --> 09:34.640]  and exactly how they do it and they did it, but now he's so confident we're going to be
[09:34.640 --> 09:36.120]  looking at that report.
[09:36.120 --> 09:40.320]  We've also got the Atlantic, which is the pro-pedophilia publication.
[09:40.320 --> 09:44.280]  Well, the New York Times is pro-pedophilia as well, but I mean, they write articles
[09:44.280 --> 09:50.200]  defending it and they write articles saying that it doesn't exist simultaneously while
[09:50.200 --> 09:59.080]  a lot of the alumni of Epstein's Island, like the widower of Steve Jobs, are a big
[09:59.080 --> 10:00.200]  attendees there.
[10:00.200 --> 10:04.160]  He has articles then written saying pedophilia doesn't basically exist, and you know what
[10:04.160 --> 10:05.680]  the fundraisers do, right?
[10:05.680 --> 10:09.480]  They take every clip where I talk about Soros or I talk about jobs or I talk about them
[10:09.480 --> 10:14.640]  and they go show them clips and they get donations to attack me and donations, assuming, get
[10:14.640 --> 10:17.880]  in line, send a hit team down.
[10:17.880 --> 10:18.880]  I'm not shutting up.
[10:18.880 --> 10:20.920]  I'm never stopping because I'm not for sale.
[10:20.920 --> 10:26.280]  I'm not dirty garbage like you, but when you attack me, I attack more.
[10:26.280 --> 10:27.280]  That's how this works.
[10:27.280 --> 10:29.440]  Not the other way around.
[10:29.440 --> 10:35.600]  So that's all coming up, but oh, beware of prophecies of civil war, they say.
[10:35.600 --> 10:41.720]  We're going to spend some time on this today as well, ladies and gentlemen.
[10:41.720 --> 10:46.160]  So a big, big, big, big broadcast for you.
[10:46.160 --> 10:54.280]  And by the way, I've got sickening MRIs from the UK, Germany, France, the U.S., Canada,
[10:54.280 --> 11:00.880]  and many other places now as hospitals and cancer research facilities write papers saying
[11:00.880 --> 11:04.560]  we're pro shot, but we want you to look at this.
[11:04.560 --> 11:09.160]  We have been recommending vaccination and boosters for our cancer patients, and we've
[11:09.160 --> 11:11.080]  never seen anything like it.
[11:11.080 --> 11:13.320]  It's like putting miracle grow on a plant.
[11:13.320 --> 11:14.720]  It's like fertilizer.
[11:14.720 --> 11:16.360]  People get eaten alive in weeks.
[11:16.360 --> 11:19.160]  The cancer is just triple in size, quadruple.
[11:19.160 --> 11:20.680]  They just spread everywhere.
[11:20.680 --> 11:23.520]  So we've got that stack of news.
[11:23.520 --> 11:26.640]  This is even, the articles are all, now we're not against the shot.
[11:26.640 --> 11:30.760]  We just, you don't want to take it though if you have cancer.
[11:30.760 --> 11:37.160]  Why do you think you hear about all these cancers exploding and even NBC news as well?
[11:37.160 --> 11:38.320]  You know what?
[11:38.320 --> 11:43.160]  If you look like you have cancer and they tell you it's malignant, it's okay.
[11:43.160 --> 11:44.640]  Just don't have surgery for six months.
[11:44.640 --> 11:48.880]  It'll probably go away because they're like, how are we going to cover up this gives people
[11:48.880 --> 11:53.640]  cancer and activates dormant cancers or accelerates existing cancers.
[11:53.640 --> 11:58.840]  Well, just tell people, yeah, it's cancer, but no big deal, it's just a side effect.
[11:58.840 --> 12:03.000]  That's mainstream hundreds of headlines a year ago getting you ready.
[12:03.000 --> 12:09.160]  Like all the new headlines, hey, heart attacks are completely normal in children and everybody.
[12:09.160 --> 12:10.720]  It's normal to have strokes when you're five.
[12:10.720 --> 12:11.720]  Yeah, there's a lot.
[12:11.720 --> 12:12.720]  Yeah.
[12:12.720 --> 12:15.520]  We put, you know, ads on the sides of the buses.
[12:15.520 --> 12:19.080]  I'm going to come back and get into all of that here today, ladies and gentlemen.
[12:19.080 --> 12:20.800]  There's so much to get to.
[12:20.800 --> 12:24.160]  Remember Adam Schiff that ran the whole Russia gate hoax?
[12:24.160 --> 12:31.120]  Remember how he read an email supposedly from Trump or a text message?
[12:31.120 --> 12:35.640]  That guy's find that when Schiff read a fake text message to Trump.
[12:35.640 --> 12:37.640]  And everybody goes, this is how it works.
[12:37.640 --> 12:41.520]  I'm the boss and you cover things up and I protect you.
[12:41.520 --> 12:43.000]  Remember that was all fake.
[12:43.000 --> 12:45.160]  None of it was real.
[12:45.160 --> 12:54.160]  He read a fake text message on to the House Judiciary Committee.
[12:54.160 --> 12:58.760]  He's done it again and you ask, why would he do it again?
[12:58.760 --> 13:00.200]  Because he thinks you're stupid.
[13:00.200 --> 13:01.840]  He thinks he'll get away with it.
[13:01.840 --> 13:05.040]  And that's why it's so dangerous to be deposed by these people, even if you've done nothing
[13:05.040 --> 13:06.240]  wrong, like I've done anything wrong.
[13:06.240 --> 13:07.240]  They want to depose me.
[13:07.240 --> 13:12.480]  They want me to testify and I'm getting ready to plead the fifth because they'll lie.
[13:12.480 --> 13:17.320]  They'll get me behind closed doors and put out a transcript that's completely different
[13:17.320 --> 13:24.400]  and say I lied and have their controlled courts in D.C. indict me.
[13:24.400 --> 13:27.520]  You don't take the fifth with these criminals because you're a criminal.
[13:27.520 --> 13:32.280]  You take it because they are lying sacks of garbage.
[13:32.280 --> 13:33.280]  And there's another one.
[13:33.280 --> 13:34.280]  Caught.
[13:34.280 --> 13:38.680]  Representative Adam Schiff doctored text messages in January 6th committee.
[13:38.680 --> 13:39.680]  Wow.
[13:39.680 --> 13:44.040]  How incredibly surprising is that?
[13:44.040 --> 13:47.560]  Who would have imagined that?
[13:47.560 --> 13:49.560]  And it gets worse, ladies and gentlemen.
[13:49.560 --> 13:54.400]  We don't just have Senator Blumenthal going and speaking to a communist international
[13:54.400 --> 13:58.880]  meeting calling for communism in Connecticut last week.
[13:58.880 --> 14:07.440]  Democrat Senator Block China forced labor bill received $60,000 from Nike execs in September.
[14:07.440 --> 14:09.640]  And this guy is sold to help run death camps.
[14:09.640 --> 14:11.480]  They have death camps in Nike, does.
[14:11.480 --> 14:13.560]  And so does Apple is the worst.
[14:13.560 --> 14:19.960]  And then you get money to help cover that up and not give those folks relief.
[14:19.960 --> 14:24.320]  And then talk about how Alex Jones used to be taken off the air that same senator has
[14:24.320 --> 14:30.800]  saying I'm a bad person because I questioned mass criminal events that I will continue
[14:30.800 --> 14:34.200]  to question until the day these criminals are able to remove me off the air if they're
[14:34.200 --> 14:35.200]  able to.
[14:35.200 --> 14:40.600]  If they remove me, that's a big symbol of the canary being dead in the coal mine.
[14:40.600 --> 14:43.960]  We're going to break here in a few minutes.
[14:43.960 --> 14:50.360]  And when I come back, I've got very serious announcement concerning censorship.
[14:50.360 --> 14:54.880]  And you know, some of the people involved at this point are like, look, let's not even
[14:54.880 --> 14:59.600]  get into what's going on because it only encourages the censors.
[14:59.600 --> 15:06.120]  But to quote Yoda, after 800 years training, Jedi is my own counsel I will keep.
[15:06.120 --> 15:09.920]  I'm going, I'm not saying I'm like, yo, it's a silly joke.
[15:09.920 --> 15:14.200]  The point is, I've been, I'm just going to go with what's going on regardless of whatever
[15:14.200 --> 15:17.120]  happens because you need to know, okay.
[15:17.120 --> 15:20.960]  But these guys really are out of control.
[15:20.960 --> 15:24.760]  And what we see happening now is a beta test for all of you and your families.
[15:24.760 --> 15:28.560]  And I want you to imagine if you think the censorship is bad, imagine the censorship
[15:28.560 --> 15:30.840]  five times worse than it is right now.
[15:30.840 --> 15:34.680]  And then imagine why they want censorship like that in place, what they're going to
[15:34.680 --> 15:35.680]  be doing.
[15:35.680 --> 15:38.440]  Because everything you've seen with critical race theory and open borders and devalued
[15:38.440 --> 15:43.080]  currencies and drag queen story time and releasing deadly viruses and blocking treatments
[15:43.080 --> 15:45.480]  and giving you deadly vaccine shots.
[15:45.480 --> 15:50.400]  That's all just a prelude, an order for what's about to go down.
[15:50.400 --> 15:51.920]  You're like, God, Jones, don't scare us.
[15:51.920 --> 15:53.360]  Listen, I'm not trying to scare you.
[15:53.360 --> 15:54.760]  I'm trying to get you ready.
[15:54.760 --> 15:58.160]  Like when a tsunami is coming, you'd want to know, right?
[15:58.160 --> 16:02.160]  Because you're concerned about the power grid and we have developed the research and the
[16:02.160 --> 16:06.240]  tools to stop this evil and to break free from it and then to help others break free
[16:06.240 --> 16:07.240]  from it.
[16:07.240 --> 16:09.600]  That's why we've launched reset wars.
[16:09.600 --> 16:13.640]  Once you simply accept that there is an incredibly evil group of people in the world that are
[16:13.640 --> 16:18.720]  attempting the great reset and want a one world corporate government, then you can learn
[16:18.720 --> 16:25.040]  how to defeat them by learning their war game strategies and how to not play the game.
[16:25.040 --> 16:30.920]  After decades of intense research, our quest to discover the key to breaking the global
[16:30.920 --> 16:33.840]  response is now live.
[16:33.840 --> 16:37.000]  The reset wars have begun.
[16:37.000 --> 16:40.680]  Start your journey at resetwars.com today.
[16:40.680 --> 16:44.880]  Their programming are very subconscious on our side key to create these false constructs
[16:44.880 --> 16:46.520]  that they then control.
[16:46.520 --> 16:49.120]  We're going to lay out how that works.
[16:49.120 --> 16:53.840]  Your journey against tyranny and true empowerment begins at resetwars.com.
[16:53.840 --> 16:55.840]  Please join me there.
[16:55.840 --> 17:01.840]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[17:01.840 --> 17:03.840]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[17:03.840 --> 17:04.840]  Welcome.
[17:04.840 --> 17:05.840]  Hello, Alex.
[17:05.840 --> 17:06.840]  Yes, Malcolm.
[17:06.840 --> 17:07.840]  All right.
[17:07.840 --> 17:09.840]  I will make this quick and real short where the other patrons can get on the line.
[17:09.840 --> 17:14.760]  Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Shroyer, Supermail
[17:14.760 --> 17:17.520]  Vitality and Brain Force Plus.
[17:17.520 --> 17:18.520]  Mix those two together.
[17:18.520 --> 17:20.080]  You're an unstoppable tank.
[17:20.080 --> 17:22.080]  Supermail Vitality really, really works.
[17:22.080 --> 17:27.000]  It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up.
[17:27.000 --> 17:32.600]  And so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions that also work quite well
[17:32.600 --> 17:33.600]  but just aren't as strong.
[17:33.600 --> 17:35.600]  This is like a very fine wine.
[17:35.600 --> 17:38.000]  In fact, each batch is different.
[17:38.000 --> 17:39.000]  Sometimes it's super strong.
[17:39.000 --> 17:40.000]  Sometimes it's just okay.
[17:40.000 --> 17:43.200]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as
[17:43.200 --> 17:44.200]  strong?
[17:44.200 --> 17:45.200]  That's just how it is.
[17:45.200 --> 17:46.200]  It's how it works.
[17:46.200 --> 17:47.640]  So it's always good.
[17:47.640 --> 17:49.800]  It's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[17:49.800 --> 17:56.800]  Yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[17:56.800 --> 18:03.880]  This is a great sponsor.
[18:03.880 --> 18:07.480]  We have one of the best deals you're going to find out there on a high quality, high
[18:07.480 --> 18:09.080]  rated satellite phone.
[18:09.080 --> 18:10.080]  So you can't be tracked.
[18:10.080 --> 18:11.080]  You can't be traced.

[18:35.000 --> 18:36.000]  These aren't.
[18:36.000 --> 18:37.400]  And the calls are free when folks call you.
[18:37.400 --> 18:42.200]  You just pay $99.95 a month for your minutes, $115 minutes.
[18:42.200 --> 18:45.160]  So the calls you were free or it's like a regular cell phone, you're not being tracked
[18:45.160 --> 18:46.160]  or traced.
[18:46.160 --> 18:49.320]  So this is one of my car, I've given them to my parents as gifts, way out the middle
[18:49.320 --> 18:55.000]  of nowhere where regular phones don't work, they work, infowarsphone.com or 941-955-1029-41955,

[19:00.520 --> 19:05.760]  Climb to the top of the food chain with alpha power by InfoWars Life.
[19:05.760 --> 19:12.160]  For those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels, most men know that testosterone
[19:12.160 --> 19:18.560]  levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[19:18.560 --> 19:25.800]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive and muscle loss.
[19:25.800 --> 19:30.280]  Alpha power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on
[19:30.280 --> 19:31.280]  the market.
[19:31.280 --> 19:37.760]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated
[19:37.760 --> 19:44.720]  into their most potent forms, including uricoma longipolia, originally from Malaysia, makaroo
[19:44.720 --> 19:50.720]  from Peru, horny goatweed from China and tribulus from India.

[20:01.760 --> 20:08.760]  Including a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:32.760 --> 20:40.360]  Let me go ahead and lay this out because this is a big deal and it's a bigger deal
[20:40.360 --> 20:44.960]  than just InfoWars and it's a bigger deal than just ResetWars and there's a few important
[20:44.960 --> 20:48.280]  announcements that need to be laid out as well.
[20:48.280 --> 20:53.080]  I partnered with some folks that work with some of the biggest names out there in self-help
[20:53.080 --> 20:54.440]  that I actually agree with and like.
[20:54.440 --> 20:57.840]  These are big names and it's the groups that do that.
[20:57.840 --> 21:01.880]  We developed the last six months, the ResetWars course, wanted to be great, wanted to be the
[21:01.880 --> 21:05.360]  first and a whole bunch of stuff we're going to do, but it's the most important masterclass
[21:05.360 --> 21:07.360]  really up front, MindWars, SpiritWars.
[21:07.360 --> 21:11.240]  If you don't have your operating system under control, if the enemy's got software running
[21:11.240 --> 21:15.440]  on you that you didn't put there and that God didn't put there, you need to get it off.
[21:15.440 --> 21:19.600]  This is like a technological exorcism basically, but beyond that.
[21:19.600 --> 21:27.000]  It's very, very simple but also complex at the same time and it's deadly real.
[21:27.000 --> 21:32.320]  So they're like, oh no, we've been doing this for years, we've got all these things, everything's
[21:32.320 --> 21:35.400]  fine, we're not going to have problems with our big email systems, with our big server
[21:35.400 --> 21:39.360]  systems, we've got top lawyers, compliance, all of us are great.
[21:39.360 --> 21:40.360]  I don't want to handle it.
[21:40.360 --> 21:42.560]  You do it all.
[21:42.560 --> 21:43.560]  The day it launches.
[21:43.560 --> 21:46.920]  They didn't do it before or after the day it launches on Monday.
[21:46.920 --> 21:49.280]  Their email company takes them down.
[21:49.280 --> 21:55.600]  The server shuts them down and says, in terms of service, you can't work without shows.
[21:55.600 --> 22:00.320]  They'd already approached them months and months ago and gotten the OKs and go, oh yeah,
[22:00.320 --> 22:01.320]  we'll help them.
[22:01.320 --> 22:02.560]  PayPal.
[22:02.560 --> 22:06.200]  Before they banned us, begged and offered to fly.
[22:06.200 --> 22:13.360]  At the time, the general manager here, great guy, Tim Frosier, he's now a consultant, to
[22:13.360 --> 22:17.200]  their main base in Tennessee to help him and learn them and say, yeah, just give us all
[22:17.200 --> 22:22.040]  your accounts, give us all your social systems, give us all the banks you're using and we
[22:22.040 --> 22:25.200]  just want to be all your business.
[22:25.200 --> 22:27.440]  And then we're like, OK, here's all of it.
[22:27.440 --> 22:29.360]  They go, no, we don't want to do your business now.
[22:29.360 --> 22:30.560]  You're banned.
[22:30.560 --> 22:34.680]  They wanted to get a target list for all of our other banking systems to take us down.
[22:34.680 --> 22:35.680]  We now know that.
[22:35.680 --> 22:40.360]  We also got internal documents out of a large G2 group out of Boston that runs all this.
[22:40.360 --> 22:42.520]  This is intelligence agency stuff.
[22:42.520 --> 22:46.160]  So this is the level of what we've been dealing with.
[22:46.160 --> 22:51.040]  So when I tell you stuff's going on, you don't know about 10% of it.
[22:51.040 --> 22:52.760]  Now that isn't about Alex Jones being a victim.
[22:52.760 --> 22:54.160]  I'm on the front lines in a war.
[22:54.160 --> 22:56.040]  I expect this to happen.
[22:56.040 --> 22:59.640]  I mean, if I was driving home today and they killed me in a four-way stop, I wouldn't be
[22:59.640 --> 23:00.640]  surprised.
[23:00.640 --> 23:01.640]  I mean, I'm not trying to act dramatic.
[23:01.640 --> 23:02.640]  I mean, I'm in a war.
[23:02.640 --> 23:03.640]  I expect this.
[23:03.640 --> 23:04.640]  I already consider myself dead.
[23:04.640 --> 23:05.640]  I love life.
[23:05.640 --> 23:09.040]  I never commit suicide, but every day is a bonus.
[23:09.040 --> 23:13.720]  I mean, I see myself as on a suicide mission and it's actually very empowering.
[23:13.720 --> 23:16.040]  Now, that said, I want to work hard.
[23:16.040 --> 23:17.240]  I don't want to be reckless.
[23:17.240 --> 23:18.520]  I want to live as long as possible.
[23:18.520 --> 23:21.520]  I want to be in God's mission and so I'm as careful as I can be.
[23:21.520 --> 23:25.080]  But I am now fully committed to God.
[23:25.080 --> 23:29.680]  I've committed myself to God's hands and that's it.
[23:29.680 --> 23:34.360]  Now that said, you heard Brian Steltzer two years ago say, we want to start censoring
[23:34.360 --> 23:36.160]  text messages and people's emails.
[23:36.160 --> 23:42.160]  Now they're doing it everywhere and it's sick and it's evil and it's happening all over.
[23:42.160 --> 23:47.640]  And so they didn't just kick this group off their email system or their server and tell
[23:47.640 --> 23:54.200]  them you're not allowed to have Alex Jones on.
[23:54.200 --> 23:59.160]  Then the big computer companies and the email companies that most of you are using like
[23:59.160 --> 24:04.080]  Gmail, the rest of them, Yahoo, you name it, AOL, people still have that.
[24:04.080 --> 24:07.120]  They're not letting you get the emails we send.
[24:07.120 --> 24:10.400]  They're not even putting them in a junk folder.
[24:10.400 --> 24:13.120]  They're just not letting you get them, period.
[24:13.120 --> 24:17.680]  And you buy an online course and you're sent the six plus hours of HD video.
[24:17.680 --> 24:20.880]  So the course has been a very big success.
[24:20.880 --> 24:23.400]  It's a success in the information contained.
[24:23.400 --> 24:24.400]  That's the biggest part.
[24:24.400 --> 24:26.720]  But also funding our operations, huge success.
[24:26.720 --> 24:28.400]  A lot of people signed up.
[24:28.400 --> 24:30.240]  People rave reviews.
[24:30.240 --> 24:35.200]  Almost everybody has gotten it because I just said, we'll just take this over and we'll
[24:35.200 --> 24:38.560]  get our backup servers and we'll send them the damn emails with a video so everybody's
[24:38.560 --> 24:43.040]  getting the video now within minutes of signing up for the course.
[24:43.040 --> 24:49.680]  But even big name organizations that bring in hundreds of millions of dollars a year
[24:49.680 --> 24:50.680]  with their personalities.
[24:50.680 --> 24:54.520]  I mean, they got personalities that bring in hundreds of millions a year with these
[24:54.520 --> 24:58.760]  masterclass type self-help things they do.
[24:58.760 --> 25:00.000]  And this is a big thing.
[25:00.000 --> 25:01.760]  The globalists don't want online teaching.
[25:01.760 --> 25:05.440]  They don't want us to have access just like they want control of your schools to brain
[25:05.440 --> 25:11.360]  wash your kids and the colleges and the media they want, control of what you can privately
[25:11.360 --> 25:16.520]  send out because they know that's the whole future of the new economy that's being built.
[25:16.520 --> 25:20.360]  It's not like when you sign up with InfoWars, you get spam when you sign up at infowars.com.com.
[25:20.360 --> 25:25.200]  This will be the only way we're even able to communicate with you in the future if we
[25:25.200 --> 25:27.960]  don't turn the censorship back.
[25:27.960 --> 25:34.360]  It's just like I said months before the election last year, I said on the day of the election,
[25:34.360 --> 25:39.920]  you look like he won and the days after the mail-in ballots will say he lost, then within
[25:39.920 --> 25:44.400]  three days they will take him off Twitter, take him off Facebook, take him out everywhere
[25:44.400 --> 25:46.640]  and they did that.
[25:46.640 --> 25:50.400]  They began as soon as the election happened to turn him off because I knew they were going
[25:50.400 --> 25:51.400]  to make that move.
[25:51.400 --> 25:54.640]  That's not a hard prediction and I'm telling you when they launched war with Russia, when
[25:54.640 --> 25:58.880]  they devalued the dollar, when they launched the cyber attack, they're not just going to
[25:58.880 --> 26:00.560]  take InfoWars down.
[26:00.560 --> 26:01.560]  Everybody's going to be down.
[26:01.560 --> 26:05.320]  They're going to have a few channels of the globalist up there telling you whatever BS
[26:05.320 --> 26:09.080]  they want to tell you and starting a race war or setting off a neutron bomb.
[26:09.080 --> 26:11.000]  I mean, this is the takedown of America.
[26:11.000 --> 26:13.760]  This is a foreign multinational group taking over.
[26:13.760 --> 26:15.600]  I'm not saying all this to scare you.
[26:15.600 --> 26:16.760]  This is where we are.
[26:16.760 --> 26:18.040]  So oh, you're censoring me.
[26:18.040 --> 26:19.360]  Oh, you're blocking me.
[26:19.360 --> 26:23.080]  That's just the prelude to shutting everybody down.
[26:23.080 --> 26:27.040]  So I'm just telling you, you better do whatever it is you can to warn your friends, your family,
[26:27.040 --> 26:30.280]  your neighbors now because I don't know how long we're going to be on air or anybody is.
[26:30.280 --> 26:34.440]  You should be recording every day show, burning into DVDs so you can share them underground
[26:34.440 --> 26:39.840]  later because this information will be like high noon to a vampire in the future if we're
[26:39.840 --> 26:41.400]  unable to back the globalist off.
[26:41.400 --> 26:43.560]  There's a good chance we're going to back them off.
[26:43.560 --> 26:47.200]  If they don't feel safe with the Pentagon, the intelligence agencies, and they don't
[26:47.200 --> 26:49.840]  think they've got everybody in line, they're going to back off.
[26:49.840 --> 26:54.400]  But they're really thinking about martial law, civil war, new deadly variants they're
[26:54.400 --> 26:55.400]  going to release.
[26:55.400 --> 26:58.200]  They're already killing everybody with these injections to give people cancer and heart
[26:58.200 --> 26:59.800]  attacks and blood clots.
[26:59.800 --> 27:01.240]  So I mean, you're in a war.
[27:01.240 --> 27:04.800]  You're already in World War III right now with global corporations that run your government
[27:04.800 --> 27:06.840]  attacking you.
[27:06.840 --> 27:10.720]  And it's just hellish.
[27:10.720 --> 27:14.480]  So yes, yes, thank you for going to resetwars.com.
[27:14.480 --> 27:16.280]  Thank you for getting the course.
[27:16.280 --> 27:19.920]  And I just want to encourage you to realize you did a revolutionary act because they are
[27:19.920 --> 27:22.200]  so controlling and so out of control.
[27:22.200 --> 27:25.440]  They've been trying to block this and our listeners are so incredible.
[27:25.440 --> 27:28.920]  Despite the first day, folks not being able to get it for many hours, they didn't get
[27:28.920 --> 27:29.760]  mad at us.
[27:29.760 --> 27:34.680]  And so many emails came in figuring this was happening and then I only learned, confirmed
[27:34.680 --> 27:39.080]  yesterday it went on because the people who were involved in don't want to stir up trouble.
[27:39.080 --> 27:40.760]  They've never had anything like this happen to them.
[27:40.760 --> 27:43.600]  They don't, they're like, well, maybe we shouldn't tell people, maybe we, no, we're going to
[27:43.600 --> 27:45.000]  tell people.
[27:45.000 --> 27:47.600]  So you can get it right now and it'll come out to you.
[27:47.600 --> 27:50.240]  We've been testing it in like three minutes on average.
[27:50.240 --> 27:54.400]  The HD, you'll have it and they won't be able to stop you at resetwars.com.
[27:54.400 --> 28:00.200]  And yes, it gives us a war chest going into this future because folks behind the scenes,
[28:00.200 --> 28:02.320]  they're trying to cut off our ability to get funding.
[28:02.320 --> 28:06.640]  They're trying to cut off our ability to, to, to bank our ability to do everything.
[28:06.640 --> 28:09.600]  But that's a microcosm of them trying to shut you down.
[28:09.600 --> 28:10.880]  America's under siege.
[28:10.880 --> 28:13.720]  What's left of Christendom is under siege.
[28:13.720 --> 28:18.080]  Globalism is to shut us down and deindustrialize us and demoralize us and turn us against each
[28:18.080 --> 28:19.080]  other.
[28:19.080 --> 28:22.920]  But if we wake up to what the globalist are and a new type of warfare and come together,
[28:22.920 --> 28:28.160]  we can defeat them easily, but we must ideologically realize the war we're in and then also realize
[28:28.160 --> 28:32.040]  it's a spiritual battle and ask Christendom to defend us and protect us.
[28:32.040 --> 28:33.680]  Not the preacher, not the creepy church.
[28:33.680 --> 28:35.000]  I'm not going there either.
[28:35.000 --> 28:37.200]  That's the devil's palace.
[28:37.200 --> 28:39.080]  The devil goes there to block you.
[28:39.080 --> 28:41.960]  Open yourself up to Christ and say, help me in this time.
[28:41.960 --> 28:43.280]  I want to be good.
[28:43.280 --> 28:46.120]  Lead me, guide me, direct me, Holy Spirit, Jesus, save me.
[28:46.120 --> 28:48.200]  And the free will happens and it comes down.
[28:48.200 --> 28:50.560]  The devil worshipers go kill kids and get possessed by demons.
[28:50.560 --> 28:55.720]  You just got to ask Jesus, him and Jesus will come into you, won't possess you, but will
[28:55.720 --> 28:57.280]  come into you.
[28:57.280 --> 29:01.360]  Hey, everybody.
[29:01.360 --> 29:07.160]  This could be in full wars last Christmas because it could be America's last Christmas.
[29:07.160 --> 29:08.640]  Evil is taking over the planet.
[29:08.640 --> 29:13.680]  They're destroying our borders, our sovereignty, our supply chains, our language, our currencies.
[29:13.680 --> 29:15.000]  They're coming after us.
[29:15.000 --> 29:19.520]  And if we don't support American businesses and if we don't support independent media
[29:19.520 --> 29:24.400]  in the final days of 2021, we have no future in the midterms in 2022.
[29:24.400 --> 29:28.680]  2022 is the year where America decides its fate.
[29:28.680 --> 29:30.360]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[29:30.360 --> 29:34.720]  I want to encourage you to your Christmas shopping and fullwarstore.com because I can
[29:34.720 --> 29:39.680]  barely keep our operation going and I appreciate you keeping us in the position to fight back.
[29:39.680 --> 29:43.680]  I am so thankful for you and I'm asking you now to realize the huge investment you made
[29:43.680 --> 29:48.200]  over the years in us and I'll redouble your efforts to make sure that your investment

[29:56.960 --> 29:59.040]  take action now and keep us on the air.
[29:59.040 --> 30:00.040]  Thank you.
[30:00.040 --> 30:03.760]  I never compromise the quality of ingredients we put in info wars live products and that's
[30:03.760 --> 30:08.080]  why for more than two years we've been sold out of Ultimate Bone Broth and we could never
[30:08.080 --> 30:13.120]  get the ingredients again until now and we have reformulated and not just use the same
[30:13.120 --> 30:16.800]  ingredients, we've boosted it and made them even stronger.
[30:16.800 --> 30:20.600]  So out of all the bone broths out there, I'm telling you this is next level.
[30:20.600 --> 30:21.920]  Listen to what it's got in it.
[30:21.920 --> 30:27.000]  Cutting edge chicken bone broth protein isolate powder for better flavor and dissolvability.
[30:27.000 --> 30:31.920]  It's got turmeric root, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, goji berry, alfalfa herb powder and
[30:31.920 --> 30:36.520]  a bunch of other amazing known berries that turbo charge your body with antioxidants and
[30:36.520 --> 30:39.920]  then it's got a bunch of other incredible things like magnesium, potassium and sodium
[30:39.920 --> 30:40.920]  added.
[30:40.920 --> 30:43.120]  I mean this sucker has got everything for your electrolytes.
[30:43.120 --> 30:47.560]  It's got a real organic cocoa butter powder with natural chocolate flavor and a touch
[30:47.560 --> 30:49.560]  of sea salt and it just goes on and on.
[30:49.560 --> 30:55.360]  It is now back in stock Ultimate Bone Broth Plus available at 20% off and free shipping
[30:55.360 --> 30:57.960]  out of the gates at infowarstore.com.
[30:57.960 --> 31:03.680]  Get our great bag of it here.
[31:03.680 --> 31:08.400]  I mean this is from, people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the communists?
[31:08.400 --> 31:12.960]  Well that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested above organic
[31:12.960 --> 31:16.880]  in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee and yeah, we buy it from the little
[31:16.880 --> 31:20.800]  farmers that, you know, the media calls communists but really they're just a commune and whatever
[31:20.800 --> 31:24.360]  the point is is that it's good coffee and we've got it and the farmers don't let the
[31:24.360 --> 31:27.480]  Mexican government take over so I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and I've
[31:27.480 --> 31:30.000]  been buying it for what, 14 years and the price has never gone up.
[31:30.000 --> 31:34.720]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per pound and I just
[31:34.720 --> 31:36.880]  think it's some of the best coffee you're gonna find anywhere.
[31:36.880 --> 31:40.160]  It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas Rebels, literally.
[31:40.160 --> 31:48.240]  In fact, I'm not gonna tell you a little story, we had one, I'm not sure if you want to believe
[31:48.240 --> 31:49.240]  it.
[31:49.240 --> 31:53.440]  Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com and that's how we fund this operation and if you don't
[31:53.440 --> 31:59.560]  fund us and don't want to share that's fine.
[31:59.560 --> 32:02.400]  It's time to protect your privacy.
[32:02.400 --> 32:06.800]  It's time to come to grips with the fact that even though you don't have anything to hide,
[32:06.800 --> 32:12.680]  criminals, hackers, corporations, big tech government are stealing all of your data and
[32:12.680 --> 32:17.480]  creating a map and a database of where you go and what you do so in the future under
[32:17.480 --> 32:21.320]  their globalist takeover they can shut you down.
[32:21.320 --> 32:25.440]  Protecting your privacy, protecting your credit cards, protecting your bank accounts,
[32:25.440 --> 32:29.720]  protecting your photos, protecting everything that's on your phone is paramount.
[32:29.720 --> 32:32.400]  That's why everybody should visit infowarstore.com.

[33:02.160 --> 33:13.360]  Making a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:13.360 --> 33:25.360]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[33:25.360 --> 33:34.360]  I used to be such a sweet, sweet thing, so hey, you got to hold on to me, I opened
[33:34.360 --> 33:45.360]  doors for little old ladies, I held the blind to see, I got no friends to read the papers,
[33:45.360 --> 33:48.360]  there can't be a scene with me.
[33:48.360 --> 33:52.640]  Like I said, Alex Cooper is amazing in concert.
[33:52.640 --> 33:56.800]  He's also a patriot and fully awake, Dave Mustaine told me, and a listener, but won't
[33:56.800 --> 33:58.600]  come on the show.
[33:58.600 --> 34:03.160]  No more Mr. Clean, well here we are, I'm not name dropping, it's just cool to know that
[34:03.160 --> 34:07.640]  Alex Cooper is awake, and you see these statements out there, he's a conservative and a Christian,
[34:07.640 --> 34:09.680]  him a Christian decades ago.
[34:09.680 --> 34:13.840]  But long story short, getting back to where I was, I want to hit all this news, it's an
[34:13.840 --> 34:17.760]  exhausting amount of news, and I appreciate you guys being tuned in and actually caring,
[34:17.760 --> 34:21.880]  I'm going to try to be as judicious as I can to go over as much as this as I can today
[34:21.880 --> 34:24.320]  and also have time to open the phones up some.
[34:24.320 --> 34:28.280]  And we have the filmmaker and the producer, I mean, I have the producer credit, we help
[34:28.280 --> 34:37.080]  make it, but the real producer is a man that gave a lot of his fortune to produce a HBO
[34:37.080 --> 34:42.400]  quality film that would then be deployed to the public, so you can get it out there, five
[34:42.400 --> 34:48.840]  part series, COVID land, and then the sale of the DVD is only to pay for the crew and
[34:48.840 --> 34:54.040]  the director that work for free, but the million and a half dollars or more that was donated
[34:54.040 --> 34:57.640]  for the airline tickets and the cameras and the crews and you know, you know, hotels
[34:57.640 --> 35:02.720]  and food, but they all work at cost, but it's now time to pay the crew for the work they've
[35:02.720 --> 35:05.960]  done, and it also helps them full wars, we make some of the money that they're going
[35:05.960 --> 35:10.400]  to be popping in, in the third hour today.
[35:10.400 --> 35:15.320]  COVID land part two is out now, the mask, extremely powerful, and you get a free copy
[35:15.320 --> 35:20.800]  of dark secrets inside Bohemian Grove and the Order of Death, two films on the globalist
[35:20.800 --> 35:24.800]  and their occult activities, absolutely free, it makes a great Christmas gift, and if you
[35:24.800 --> 35:29.040]  order today or tomorrow, today for sure, anywhere in the US, you'll get away before Christmas,
[35:29.040 --> 35:33.200]  but if you wait till tomorrow, you know, it might not be guaranteed to get it a couple
[35:33.200 --> 35:37.200]  of days before, so thank you so much for your support, infowarstore.com, and then speaking
[35:37.200 --> 35:43.400]  of support, I'm going to finish up because I need to get this out there.
[35:43.400 --> 35:48.120]  Just like only Trump could stop people being set up on January 6th, going into the building,
[35:48.120 --> 35:52.240]  and people came to him and said, you need to stop it, the media spun that like, oh,
[35:52.240 --> 35:56.960]  he must have been in charge of it, no, most of them had Trump's Twitter on their phone,
[35:56.960 --> 36:02.400]  and as soon as he said, don't go in the building and come out, people came out of the building.
[36:02.400 --> 36:07.800]  Within 10 minutes, people got the text, they shared the message, and they left.
[36:07.800 --> 36:13.040]  That is it, proof that Trump wanted to attack the Capitol, that's proof that he had a system
[36:13.040 --> 36:20.160]  to communicate with his supporters, and it's the same thing here with my listeners.
[36:20.160 --> 36:26.000]  I don't have a way to communicate with a bunch of the people that bought ResetWords at ResetWords.com,
[36:26.000 --> 36:31.960]  except by this show, because you have, not your fault, I get it, you have a service,
[36:31.960 --> 36:35.840]  then years later it becomes globalist, you have an email service that's not letting
[36:35.840 --> 36:43.040]  you get the email from ResetWords.com, and that's why we used other servers to send
[36:43.040 --> 36:44.880]  you the link, and now you're getting it.
[36:44.880 --> 36:48.760]  Almost everybody's got it, like 99% of people, but others are very nice on the phone with
[36:48.760 --> 36:52.400]  our customer service, saying, yeah, I don't see the email, and we're sending it over and
[36:52.400 --> 36:57.840]  over again, and then we're getting spam filters back that, oh, we're spamming people, and
[36:57.840 --> 37:00.120]  they know exactly what they're doing.
[37:00.120 --> 37:04.360]  We brought in experts to deal with this, we've been dealing with this for years, we send
[37:04.360 --> 37:07.640]  emails out to our listeners a couple times a day, and we don't have this happen.
[37:07.640 --> 37:13.480]  It's when ResetWords happened, we just sent it out in the email, and the system was waiting
[37:13.480 --> 37:18.680]  to sabotage it, because again, it's not just happening with their company that did it first,
[37:18.680 --> 37:24.320]  then when we started doing it, they're blocking it, so they put the term ResetWords into these
[37:24.320 --> 37:31.840]  databases so that when your server system that you're using for your email sees that,
[37:31.840 --> 37:37.320]  it's blocking it, and that's what the technocracy is, live time watching you, controlling you,
[37:37.320 --> 37:38.320]  tracking you.
[37:38.320 --> 37:43.200]  That's why in the new infrastructure bill that passed, it says by 2024, all cars will
[37:43.200 --> 37:49.680]  have a little computer chip in them, because these things are so miniaturized now, that
[37:49.680 --> 37:55.160]  listens to you, watches you, and picks up alcohol and sends it back to the government.
[37:55.160 --> 38:00.840]  Total 1984, they claim it's for good reasons, it's the technocracy, it's totally out of
[38:00.840 --> 38:04.680]  control, so that's where this is going, and they know people are communicating via text
[38:04.680 --> 38:05.680]  message.
[38:05.680 --> 38:11.840]  They know we're communicating via email, that's why even in Brazil, the WhatsApp Facebook
[38:11.840 --> 38:19.360]  for now two years has been blocking Bolsonaro, so that Bolsonaro can't even send out text
[38:19.360 --> 38:23.960]  messages as the president to his supporters.
[38:23.960 --> 38:27.280]  So I'm very glad to see that Devin Nunes, who's a very competent, very smart person,
[38:27.280 --> 38:33.560]  I really respect, is going to help Trump clean up the mess that he's got at Mar-a-Lago with
[38:33.560 --> 38:39.160]  all those sycophants around him that I know have taken billions of dollars, over two billion,
[38:39.160 --> 38:41.920]  and won't build anything for Trump, even though they could.
[38:41.920 --> 38:45.280]  I mean, with tens of millions of dollars, we've built stuff better than what Trump's
[38:45.280 --> 38:48.520]  got, and I'm not proud of that by the way, that makes me feel like a piece of crap.
[38:48.520 --> 38:52.760]  In fact, I'm the one that got Rodgers to talk to Trump about bragging, it just shows how
[38:52.760 --> 38:57.480]  influenceable Trump is, and how good he is, it's just that he's got blind spots, Rodgers
[38:57.480 --> 39:00.920]  like, why aren't you on parlor, why aren't you working with Gab, why aren't you doing
[39:00.920 --> 39:05.640]  partnerships to have your own pages now, and finally Trump's doing that.
[39:05.640 --> 39:10.360]  So if the saboteurs won't let him build his own thing, because believe me, you think we
[39:10.360 --> 39:15.000]  could attack, imagine Trump trying to build something, the gremlins attacking, imagine
[39:15.000 --> 39:22.320]  what's going on with Trump, and I've got the inside baseball on it, it is absolutely
[39:22.320 --> 39:23.320]  insane.
[39:23.320 --> 39:29.440]  Yeah, they've been flagging Trump's text messages for years, that even tries to send
[39:29.440 --> 39:35.720]  people that signed up via phone to get messages from him, they won't let him have that.
[39:35.720 --> 39:41.600]  So that's how they're operating, and so the last bastion of communication is the phone
[39:41.600 --> 39:45.520]  numbers you can call and register to get text, we've got one of those, a lot of folks signed
[39:45.520 --> 39:49.600]  up for it, we haven't promoted it in a while, we probably should, and emails, I mean, there's
[39:49.600 --> 39:54.480]  going to get the point if we don't roll back the tyranny, we're the only way under an internet
[39:54.480 --> 39:59.920]  kill switch, you're going to get communication from us as email, or shortwave radio, and
[39:59.920 --> 40:06.280]  I pay $11,000 a month for us to be on seven hours a day, on WWCR, four hours there in
[40:06.280 --> 40:12.880]  the day, three hours at night, and the left's writing articles about that, trying to get
[40:12.880 --> 40:17.760]  us taking off that, they want us silenced because we're loyal Americans that understand
[40:17.760 --> 40:23.800]  the takeover and aware of what's happening, so again, if you got reset wars, if you bought
[40:23.800 --> 40:27.960]  the course, thank you, thank you, we wouldn't be able to stay open if you hadn't done that,
[40:27.960 --> 40:32.240]  and you pushed us over the edge from the red into the black before the year end, thank
[40:32.240 --> 40:35.680]  you for keeping us in the fight so we can fight for myself and my family, and for you
[40:35.680 --> 40:42.320]  and your family, we're in this together, brother, thank you, but if you can't find it, you're
[40:42.320 --> 40:46.400]  calling our number, asking customer service, they'll just tell you the same thing, it's
[40:46.400 --> 40:55.040]  being blocked, so we're probably going to create a new URL that it doesn't say our name,
[40:55.040 --> 40:59.640]  but something like a code word or something, it's like spy stuff, where we'll send you
[40:59.640 --> 41:02.880]  that for those that are being completely blocked, in fact, they're working on it right now,
[41:02.880 --> 41:05.480]  it should be done today, we're trying to figure out what to do, right before I went on there,
[41:05.480 --> 41:07.840]  I was trying to say, we got to create a new site, create a new email, they're like, well,
[41:07.840 --> 41:11.440]  it takes time, got to get the servers, but yeah, because they even know what servers
[41:11.440 --> 41:17.000]  it's coming from, folks, I understand, powerful intelligence forces are working to suppress
[41:17.000 --> 41:22.040]  you as an American, or you as a Frenchman, or a Russian, or a South African, or a Mexican,
[41:22.040 --> 41:30.720]  or a Brazilian, are working around the clock to keep you from being able to go to resetwars.com
[41:30.720 --> 41:37.440]  and get a course, oh, they force Fiji, Hillary Clinton, and they force Fiji, all the rest
[41:37.440 --> 41:42.520]  of these new world order people, but they're working around the clock to keep you from
[41:42.520 --> 41:46.920]  getting resetwars.com, why is that, well, it's multifaceted, they want you to have a
[41:46.920 --> 41:51.040]  bad experience, so you're mad at us, you're not stupid, people are seeing through, in
[41:51.040 --> 41:54.560]  fact, we got a lot of emails, folks saying, I see what they're doing, I'm buying courses
[41:54.560 --> 41:57.880]  for friends and family, it's backfiring, our listeners aren't stupid, and I'm not kissing
[41:57.880 --> 42:02.680]  your ass, it's true, you are the smartest, most informed, dialed in people that there
[42:02.680 --> 42:06.200]  are out there, you may not be good at math, just like I'm not, but you're sure as hell
[42:06.200 --> 42:11.360]  good at street smarts, and so again, then when you have a bad experience, so you don't
[42:11.360 --> 42:15.160]  get it and don't watch it, and they want to hurt our relationship, and they're really
[42:15.160 --> 42:20.120]  scared of what is in resetwars, because I mean, if you really watch six hours of me laying
[42:20.120 --> 42:23.760]  this out, this is unlike anything I've ever done, I'm very calm and very focused, it's
[42:23.760 --> 42:28.680]  all, I mean, we wrote this to make sure it was very specific and very scientific, so
[42:28.680 --> 42:33.920]  thank you all for your support, resetwars.com, resetwars.com, and now we've worked out the
[42:33.920 --> 42:38.200]  sabotage for now, so if you sign up right now, within three minutes of signing up, you
[42:38.200 --> 42:42.720]  will get the course sent to you, don't let them stop you, they are trying to stop you,
[42:42.720 --> 42:47.400]  they're trying to break our will, don't let them do it, resetwars.com, I want to blow
[42:47.400 --> 42:51.680]  them away, I want to get more members today than we got in the last three days, take info
[42:51.680 --> 42:58.240]  wars the next level, and I will not back down ever, thank you so much.
[42:58.240 --> 43:04.720]  So this could be, everything I do is about victory for humanity, everything I promote
[43:04.720 --> 43:09.640]  is about standing up against the new world order by empowering humanity, well that's
[43:09.640 --> 43:15.240]  why resetwars.com is so important, not only is it a game changing course of critical information
[43:15.240 --> 43:20.920]  to unlock your mind from the matrix, but it's something that gets around Klaus Schwab's
[43:20.920 --> 43:28.640]  attempt to shut down American infrastructure and American jobs, it is the true digital
[43:28.640 --> 43:34.360]  economy, it's the spiritual economy of the mind and transcendent control, I've been
[43:34.360 --> 43:40.920]  on there 28 years, and all of our work has been amazing, thanks to God, and God's divine
[43:40.920 --> 43:44.800]  empowerment and blessing, but I got to tell you out of everything I've done, resetwars
[43:44.800 --> 43:50.960]  is the most important, and it is now available now at the month of December 20th, 21 is here
[43:50.960 --> 43:57.880]  at resetwars.com, start your journey to the next level today at resetwars.com, the globalist
[43:57.880 --> 44:05.200]  fear this information, the globalist are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare
[44:05.200 --> 44:10.080]  and with poisons and chemicals added to the food, it's all come out, and they're doing
[44:10.080 --> 44:14.880]  that not because we're weak, but because we're made the image of God, the creator, and we
[44:14.880 --> 44:20.680]  are powerful, and the social engineers fear that so much, so that's why I repeat that
[44:20.680 --> 44:27.320]  famous internet saying that nobody knows who first came up with the boy, is it true?
[44:27.320 --> 44:33.680]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless, they need all their
[44:33.680 --> 44:40.200]  propaganda, all their lies, and all their evil, and all their cultural death, because they
[44:40.200 --> 44:44.800]  know we are strong, and they know in the end they signed on to God of this world who is
[44:44.800 --> 44:48.560]  a loser, and that's why it's so important that everybody keep in full wars in the air
[44:48.560 --> 44:53.400]  now more than ever, because even if you don't believe in God, what the globalist are manifesting
[44:53.400 --> 44:58.280]  and setting up is a channel, and we are opposing the one world government and the mark of the
[44:58.280 --> 45:00.240]  beast they just announced.
[45:00.240 --> 45:05.480]  Welcome to the top of the food chain with Alpha Power by Infowars Life.
[45:05.480 --> 45:11.880]  For those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels, most men know that testosterone
[45:11.880 --> 45:18.280]  levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[45:18.280 --> 45:25.480]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.
[45:25.480 --> 45:30.000]  Alpha Power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on
[45:30.000 --> 45:31.200]  the market.
[45:31.200 --> 45:37.480]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated
[45:37.480 --> 45:44.440]  into their most potent forms, including uricoma longipolia, originally from Malaysia, makaroo
[45:44.440 --> 45:50.440]  from Peru, horny goatweed from China, and tribulus from India.

[46:08.400 --> 46:24.360]  your
[46:24.360 --> 46:29.640]  that have never been heated up and so it has a dramatic effect compared to
[46:29.640 --> 46:33.320]  powdered versions that also work quite well but just aren't as strong. This is
[46:33.320 --> 46:37.560]  like a very fine wine. In fact, each batch is different. Sometimes it's
[46:37.560 --> 46:40.520]  super strong, sometimes it's just okay. People are like, why are you selling
[46:40.520 --> 46:43.600]  something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't strong? That's just how it is.
[46:43.600 --> 46:48.920]  It's how it works. So it's always good. It's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[46:48.920 --> 46:54.920]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls-Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[46:54.920 --> 47:09.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:09.000 --> 47:28.880]  No body rides for free. I'll tell you who's riding for free. It's Bill Gates,
[47:28.880 --> 47:33.840]  Klaus Schwab. They're saying they want to get rid of us and depopulate us because
[47:33.840 --> 47:40.400]  we're riding for free. I say you're riding for free. Crank up this classic 1980s rat.
[47:40.400 --> 48:05.760]  Yeah. Sick and tired of any way but my way. No body rides for free. No body.
[48:05.760 --> 48:15.960]  No body shifts. No body, Pelosi. No body rides for free. That's why just a couple
[48:15.960 --> 48:19.920]  hundred years ago, kings were at the front lines of their wars because you
[48:19.920 --> 48:24.680]  better be in the fight if you believe in something. But what has created the
[48:24.680 --> 48:28.520]  tyranny is that you get to hide back there and never get any heat for what
[48:28.520 --> 48:34.160]  you've done and never put your miserable asses on the lines. And that's why
[48:34.160 --> 48:38.840]  they're attacking us. That's why they want to take us off air because we make
[48:38.840 --> 48:42.760]  it about Bill Gates. We make it about Queen Elizabeth and we make it about Ted
[48:42.760 --> 48:47.320]  Turner. We make it about Oprah Winfrey and we make it about Fauci and we make it
[48:47.320 --> 48:51.120]  about how they're murdering us and killing us and attacking us and how
[48:51.120 --> 48:55.760]  they're the enemy and how they need to be on the field if they want to kill us.
[48:55.760 --> 49:04.840]  You want to kill me? That's fine. Just have the nerve to do it yourself. Show me. Show me how much you want me to
[49:04.840 --> 49:12.000]  die. Show me. And I'll show you. Because you're an attack on the innocent will come
[49:12.000 --> 49:16.800]  to an end. One way or another. Alright, that's enough of this good music. Get you
[49:16.800 --> 49:24.240]  fired up. No body rides for free. No body. And I don't expect to ride for free
[49:24.240 --> 49:30.240]  either. That's why we've got our skin in the game. All our chips are in right now.
[49:30.240 --> 49:36.880]  Alright. I get so ready for the show and then just the news is so insane. I don't
[49:36.880 --> 49:44.640]  even know what to say at this point. I don't know what to say at this point. God Almighty.
[49:44.640 --> 49:52.080]  Where should I start? Because I have this problem. I mean, I get in here and go
[49:52.080 --> 49:55.160]  through all these stacks and news. Each one of these is incredible. I mean, this
[49:55.160 --> 50:03.360]  article right here. By the way, that's stolen from Rush Lumbaw. It's not plagiarism. I'm
[50:03.360 --> 50:15.880]  getting the credit. He hears me up and heavily. Mr. Snirgley. Our boss, Snirgley, is John
[50:15.880 --> 50:21.400]  Harmon. John's out today. He has something really good happening in his life. I'll
[50:21.400 --> 50:30.080]  leave it at that. Beware prophecies of civil war. The idea that such a catastrophe is
[50:30.080 --> 50:37.840]  unavoidable in America is inflammatory and coercive. Fintan O'Toole. Oh, Fintan O'Toole
[50:37.840 --> 50:42.120]  lived through the troubles in Ireland, the latest troubles. And he doesn't think we want
[50:42.120 --> 50:49.880]  to go through this. Well, I agree with you, Mr. O'Toole. Except I'm no fool. And I know
[50:49.880 --> 50:54.440]  that your masters have already started a war against us and they don't want us to realize
[50:54.440 --> 50:59.560]  that. And so you can pretend like you're part of the power structure because you're a progressive
[50:59.560 --> 51:04.800]  leftist that works for an evil organization like the Atlantic that promotes and defends
[51:04.800 --> 51:18.920]  pedophilia. So I've got that. And I've got this stack right here. We're going to win
[51:18.920 --> 51:27.000]  in 2022. Biden and Harris tells DNC Holiday Party they will win the next year's midterms
[51:27.000 --> 51:30.800]  and beyond that. And you can laugh at that because I mean, Biden really is embarrassing
[51:30.800 --> 51:36.520]  now. I mean, he was embarrassing years ago, but I mean, he is rotting on stage. It's like
[51:36.520 --> 51:41.440]  a dead dog carcass hung up on a meat hook with maggots all over it. And he's watching
[51:41.440 --> 51:52.840]  in like stop gap animation or time lapse like watching a dead dog on a meat hook with maggots
[51:52.840 --> 52:02.640]  all over it being eaten by maggots and time lapse. But we got that. You know, I've also
[52:02.640 --> 52:07.640]  got a really important clip. Let's go to the vault from 2009. Let's go to the vault of
[52:07.640 --> 52:12.560]  our predictions of what's now happening right now. Here it is from the show conspiracy
[52:12.560 --> 52:15.920]  theory. Here it is.
[52:15.920 --> 52:20.360]  Jesse Ventura's conspiracy investigators have tracked down the deadly secret behind the
[52:20.360 --> 52:26.800]  elite group that tries to rule the world. When the population gets too big to handle,
[52:26.800 --> 52:37.440]  the solution is cut it down. Now one of those sources has summoned the governor, Alex
[52:37.440 --> 52:49.280]  Jones says he knows how they plan to depopulate. Alex, you sounded urgent. There's an entire
[52:49.280 --> 52:56.200]  agenda afoot to force the population to undergo different type of medical treatments, namely
[52:56.200 --> 53:01.160]  vaccines. We're seeing a medical tyranny being set up not just in the United States,
[53:01.160 --> 53:06.560]  but worldwide under the UN and the World Health Organization. Who's behind all this?
[53:06.560 --> 53:10.720]  The Bilderberg group. They want a planetary dictatorship so they can carry out their
[53:10.720 --> 53:14.880]  forced depopulation agenda and they want to do it through the medical system. And that's
[53:14.880 --> 53:19.960]  why vaccines are so important. We know that many of these vaccines turn out to have serious
[53:19.960 --> 53:25.720]  adverse reactions that this is being done by design. They kill you slowly over time.
[53:25.720 --> 53:29.240]  That's why they're called soft kill. And I've got an insider I think you should really talk
[53:29.240 --> 53:34.400]  to, Dr. Rima Labo. But she doesn't live inside the United States because she's so concerned
[53:34.400 --> 53:38.720]  about all the police state developments that are taking place. But if you can get her to
[53:38.720 --> 53:43.040]  come up here and talk to you. She's a medical doctor. She's treated heads of states and
[53:43.040 --> 53:47.280]  she really understands what's happening on the inside.
[53:47.280 --> 53:53.840]  Dr. LeBow, how are you? I'm fine. Thank you, Governor.
[53:53.840 --> 53:58.560]  Governor Jesse Ventura, thanks for coming. Now, you've left the United States of America.
[53:58.560 --> 54:00.880]  Yes, sir, I have. Why?
[54:00.880 --> 54:05.400]  I do not feel safe living in the United States. Really? Do you want to come in and sit down?
[54:05.400 --> 54:10.480]  No, sir. I'd rather not. You'd rather just be here so you can make a fast exit if you
[54:10.480 --> 54:16.920]  ask. As soon as you and I finish, I'm leaving the country again. Why? Because in a very short
[54:16.920 --> 54:24.720]  time, not today, not tomorrow, but very soon, we'll be facing compulsory vaccination under
[54:24.720 --> 54:29.240]  the mistaken term of voluntary vaccination.
[54:29.240 --> 54:32.400]  So are you talking to me now about the current swine flu?
[54:32.400 --> 54:33.400]  I am.
[54:33.400 --> 54:36.800]  Is that what you're talking about? Now, what is it about these vaccinations? You think
[54:36.800 --> 54:37.800]  that they're bad?
[54:37.800 --> 54:43.760]  Well, first of all, let's start with the fact that the World Health Organization has decided
[54:43.760 --> 54:50.520]  that we have 90% too many people. The World Health Organization has been working since
[54:50.520 --> 54:56.280]  1974 on vaccines to create permanent sterility.
[54:56.280 --> 55:00.960]  Doctor, the response is going to be, you're crazy. How can you say this stuff?
[55:00.960 --> 55:03.640]  I show them the documentation.
[55:03.640 --> 55:06.840]  No, this is pretty shocking.
[55:06.840 --> 55:14.560]  This process has already been ongoing. To make matters worse, we know that the vaccines
[55:14.560 --> 55:21.480]  that were illegally approved by the FDA contain a substance called squalene.
[55:21.480 --> 55:29.560]  An organic compound used in vaccines to stimulate the immune system and increase the response.
[55:29.560 --> 55:35.480]  If I inject you with squalene, your immune system will attack the squalene, but then
[55:35.480 --> 55:40.560]  it starts attacking all of the parts of your body. What does that look like when you meet
[55:40.560 --> 55:45.440]  a person to whom that is happening? It looks like Gulf War syndrome. It looks like every
[55:45.440 --> 55:51.400]  joint in the body swollen and intolerably painful and immobilized.
[55:51.400 --> 55:53.760]  This is in these shots they're going to give us?
[55:53.760 --> 55:59.840]  It's in some of them, but the U.S. government has a trick up their sleeve, which is they
[55:59.840 --> 56:08.880]  will induce a pandemic using the nasal mist vaccine, which is a live attenuated virus.
[56:08.880 --> 56:14.840]  That means that if I take it, I can infect you. You're going to get the flu. Everybody
[56:14.840 --> 56:21.480]  around us is going to get the flu. Then the United States government, based on their statements
[56:21.480 --> 56:28.000]  that they've already made, will say, oh my, we have a pandemic. Oh my goodness, we don't
[56:28.000 --> 56:37.600]  have enough doses. So we'll add mix squalene at the 90,000 injection stations that the
[56:37.600 --> 56:44.640]  Department of Health and Human Services announced that they will ship the vaccines to.
[56:44.640 --> 56:48.440]  They're lining up sometimes by the hundreds for an H1N1 flu shot.
[56:48.440 --> 56:50.160]  All right, let's stop right there.
[56:50.160 --> 56:51.160]  Yes, that means.
[56:51.160 --> 56:54.760]  Now, here's the deal. They had all this ready with that battle plan. Her husband was the
[56:54.760 --> 57:00.320]  former head of special operations for the military, three-star general. That's how she
[57:00.320 --> 57:04.360]  knew a lot of this, but she was also a head doctor, two major heads of state, and that's
[57:04.360 --> 57:14.520]  all confirmed, okay? So that's 12 years ago. No, no, I'm sorry. 13 years ago, 13 years
[57:14.520 --> 57:21.640]  ago, what you just saw and you noticed it's basically what happened today. So that's their
[57:21.640 --> 57:26.320]  plan, folks. That's why they want to soft the air. And again, the vaccine causes the
[57:26.320 --> 57:31.600]  illnesses. It's a live vaccine. This is a live vaccine. It's just an mRNA synthetic
[57:31.600 --> 57:38.440]  nanotech artificially made, but still replicates. COVID-19 was a nanotech they released, then
[57:38.440 --> 57:43.800]  the vaccine makes the nanotech in your body. It's nanotech on record. It's artificial virus
[57:43.800 --> 57:49.360]  that replicates. It's end of day stuff. Everything I...
[57:49.360 --> 57:54.960]  So this could be literally your last chance with all the insane things happening in the

[58:49.360 --> 58:54.880]  The purpose of fear is to call us into action, and there is plenty to be afraid of today.
[58:54.880 --> 59:00.560]  Half the population has lined up for an untested, deadly, and debilitating experimental injection
[59:00.560 --> 59:05.440]  because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease. The perpetrators
[59:05.440 --> 59:10.280]  of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80% of the population hooked up
[59:10.280 --> 59:15.680]  to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years. For those of us who have
[59:15.680 --> 59:20.600]  awoken from the spell, we know this is all really happening, and it's unbelievably unsettling
[59:20.600 --> 59:25.960]  to see. But there is only two things to do. We continue sounding the alarm because it's
[59:25.960 --> 59:30.880]  a numbers game. If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win. But even when
[59:30.880 --> 59:35.920]  we win, and we eventually will, the days of convenience are soon coming to an end, and
[59:35.920 --> 59:42.000]  so we must prepare, get up to a year's worth of storable foods, water filtration, survival
[59:42.000 --> 1:00:08.480]  gear, seeds, shortwave radios, and lifesaving knowledge at infoorstore.com.
[1:00:08.480 --> 1:00:23.200]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're going to live in a 1984 society or the 1776 society.
[1:00:23.200 --> 1:00:27.960]  So that's a 45-minute TV show because there's 15 minutes and ads an hour on radio and TV.
[1:00:27.960 --> 1:00:35.120]  That's the industry standard. It's a 45-minute show, and I consulted the first season and
[1:00:35.120 --> 1:00:38.640]  I really wrote, and I wrote, I gave them all the documents and proof. They had boosters
[1:00:38.640 --> 1:00:41.160]  not believing me, and I was giving them an ultimatum. I'm like, yeah, I'll get you General
[1:00:41.160 --> 1:00:45.320]  Stubblebine, former head of Special Forces, and all their everything else, and former
[1:00:45.320 --> 1:00:50.440]  head of Army operations. I'll give you all this, and they would vet it and check it,
[1:00:50.440 --> 1:00:57.520]  and wow, this is real. They did it. But that episode on depopulation and the episode on
[1:00:57.520 --> 1:01:03.680]  the FEMA Camp police state plan, which was all real, all got pulled. They all aired one
[1:01:03.680 --> 1:01:10.760]  time. They all got record ratings for the history of true TV, and they went in remotely
[1:01:10.760 --> 1:01:16.720]  on the DVRs. In fact, back that clip up one minute. I didn't play the very end of it.
[1:01:16.720 --> 1:01:23.960]  They went into the DVRs and erased them off of people's DVRs on multiple platforms. Why
[1:01:23.960 --> 1:01:27.240]  would the deep state do that if it wasn't something that damaged them, if it wasn't
[1:01:27.240 --> 1:01:31.760]  something that was true? Well, of course, it was all real, and that goes back to the
[1:01:31.760 --> 1:01:36.680]  old Internet saying I quote every day. Not out of lack of news. I have literally hundreds
[1:01:36.680 --> 1:01:39.680]  and hundreds of articles here in clips that are incredible. But why do I go back? This
[1:01:39.680 --> 1:01:49.680]  is true. If the situation was hopeless, if the situation was hopeless, the propaganda
[1:01:49.680 --> 1:01:58.760]  would not be necessary. Well, the ADL, the Anti-Defamation League had to threaten Fox
[1:01:58.760 --> 1:02:06.800]  News and say how dare you show George Soros as a puppet master saying defund police plus
[1:02:06.800 --> 1:02:12.200]  no bail equals lawless chaos. That's not being censored or attempted to be censored by the
[1:02:12.200 --> 1:02:20.400]  ADL because it's a lie. The image of George Soros popping up behind a wall with strings
[1:02:20.400 --> 1:02:28.760]  to the DA's office saying defund police and the AG's office saying no bail equals lawless
[1:02:28.760 --> 1:02:43.560]  chaos. That's true. He does fund that. He does want no jail time. He does put your DA's
[1:02:43.560 --> 1:02:48.400]  and district county attorneys in. He does that. I mean, that's all not debated. He brags
[1:02:48.400 --> 1:02:56.320]  about it. But you're not supposed to talk about him because he gave an interview to
[1:02:56.320 --> 1:03:07.040]  NPR in the late 80s where he said he believed he was the Messiah. And he's got Jonathan
[1:03:07.040 --> 1:03:15.040]  Rosenblatt, I guess the mini-me of Dr. Evil over here, literally looks like mini-me but
[1:03:15.040 --> 1:03:19.320]  it's tall. I'm not going to be so short of a little mini-me to him. And he's like up
[1:03:19.320 --> 1:03:26.320]  there telling America we're racist because we don't like George Soros spending billions
[1:03:26.320 --> 1:03:34.400]  in the last decade to buy our local government so he can let armed robbers out. I mean, he's
[1:03:34.400 --> 1:03:44.120]  a freaking maniac lunatic. His son posts videos of himself at Aleister Crowley events and we
[1:03:44.120 --> 1:03:51.000]  just have to bow down to him. Oh, you're superior, George Soros. Please let my family get carjacked.
[1:03:51.000 --> 1:04:05.800]  Oh, please let the DA let out the mass shooter. And then he also believes he's the Messiah.
[1:04:05.800 --> 1:04:13.240]  I mean, what's Jonathan Rosenblatt up to? I mean, he really thinks George Soros is the
[1:04:13.240 --> 1:04:24.480]  Messiah. The Messiah. And then we're not supposed to just say, hey, man, please don't
[1:04:24.480 --> 1:04:29.760]  defund the police. Please don't take my guns. He wants to take the police away and take
[1:04:29.760 --> 1:04:36.200]  your guns. Why? Why do you want to kill me? What did I do? My grandfathers fought Hitler.
[1:04:36.200 --> 1:04:40.480]  They didn't help him like you did. I wasn't brought up to round up and kill Jews like
[1:04:40.480 --> 1:04:44.400]  you were. Why do you hate me so much? Because you're a Satanist. That's why you're not
[1:04:44.400 --> 1:04:48.560]  a Jew. You're not a Christian. You're not a white guy. You're not a black guy. You're
[1:04:48.560 --> 1:04:57.160]  a devil, George Soros. And the mouth of hell is opening wide up for you. And Mr. Rosenblatt
[1:04:57.160 --> 1:05:04.600]  and Bill Clinton. Everything I do. This could be in full wars last Christmas because it could
[1:05:04.600 --> 1:05:10.120]  be America's last Christmas. Evil is taking over the planet. They're destroying our borders,
[1:05:10.120 --> 1:05:15.000]  our sovereignty, our supply chains, our language, our currencies. They're coming after us. And
[1:05:15.000 --> 1:05:19.720]  if we don't support American businesses, and if we don't support independent media in the
[1:05:19.720 --> 1:05:27.440]  final days of 2021, we have no future in the midterms in 2022. 2022 is the year where America
[1:05:27.440 --> 1:05:31.600]  decides its fate. I want to thank you all for your support. I want to encourage you
[1:05:31.600 --> 1:05:36.640]  to your Christmas shopping and fullwarestore.com because I can barely keep our operation going.

[1:05:41.200 --> 1:05:46.080]  I'm asking you now to realize the huge investment you made over the years in us, and I'll redouble
[1:05:46.080 --> 1:05:52.080]  your efforts to make sure that your investment in freedom continues on. Infowarsstore.com

[1:06:28.080 --> 1:06:33.960]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, we are now into hour number two on this live December 16th,
[1:06:33.960 --> 1:06:38.000]  Thursday broadcast. And I'm going to give the toll free number out right now. So let's
[1:06:38.000 --> 1:06:43.200]  fire that phone system up. And so your calls can come in and we will take your calls on
[1:06:43.200 --> 1:06:48.560]  any of the news items, any of the issues, first time callers, long time callers, callers
[1:06:48.560 --> 1:06:55.360]  that hate me, callers that love me. I want it to be a free for all. So let's just do
[1:06:55.360 --> 1:06:59.760]  this. Let's just run through some of the headlines here of the whole COVID new world order takeover
[1:06:59.760 --> 1:07:06.080]  news today. Court reinstates health worker coronavirus vaccine mandate in half of the
[1:07:06.080 --> 1:07:13.440]  US. Not good news. A federal court of appeals last night effectively revived a by administration
[1:07:13.440 --> 1:07:19.040]  vaccine mandate for health workers and hospitals that received federal funding in roughly half
[1:07:19.040 --> 1:07:24.960]  of the US. The procedural ruling by the New Orleans based US court of appeals with the
[1:07:24.960 --> 1:07:30.160]  fifth circuit temporarily scaled back a nationwide injunctions put in place by Louisiana based
[1:07:30.160 --> 1:07:36.400]  federal judge late last month. The move notched a modest and tentative win for the by administration
[1:07:36.400 --> 1:07:41.840]  following a series of legal setbacks to efforts to blunt the effects of a global pandemic. Oh,
[1:07:41.840 --> 1:07:45.680]  the global pandemic that came out of the Wuhan lab they created with a vaccine that gives it to you
[1:07:45.680 --> 1:07:51.840]  that has killed roughly 800,000 people in the US. Yeah, right. blocking regular treatment for
[1:07:51.840 --> 1:07:56.560]  regular calls pneumonia has an issue is the Department of Health and Human Services vaccine
[1:07:56.560 --> 1:08:01.840]  mandate for most workers at health care facilities that received Medicare and Medicaid. They're
[1:08:01.840 --> 1:08:06.960]  saying oh, since you take the money we control you just like the social credit score which has
[1:08:06.960 --> 1:08:17.120]  been subjected to numerous lawsuits since it's November rollout. Makes me mad. We'll be getting
[1:08:17.120 --> 1:08:24.960]  to more of that coming up. Here's the fear mongering CDC issues grim forecast warning that
[1:08:24.960 --> 1:08:33.920]  weekly COVID cases will jump by 55% to 1.3 million by Christmas Day. And that deaths will surge 73%
[1:08:33.920 --> 1:08:43.520]  to 15,600 a week as Omnicron becomes the dominant strain. Here's another one booster mandates begin
[1:08:43.520 --> 1:08:49.040]  business employees universities are taking the data into their own hands and requiring booster
[1:08:49.040 --> 1:08:54.080]  coronavirus shots. Oh, the data that the shots don't work that they erase your immune system
[1:08:54.080 --> 1:09:00.720]  that you give you blood clots and microcarditis. Oh, but Axio says it's in their own hands.
[1:09:01.440 --> 1:09:06.720]  They the corporate leaders are enforcing the booster just like Israel did six months ago.
[1:09:06.720 --> 1:09:13.680]  So Israel's now to their fifth shot now saying seven is needed. Figure this out yet.
[1:09:14.880 --> 1:09:19.840]  You know, I figured it out before it started. We're on record laying out exactly what they
[1:09:19.840 --> 1:09:28.080]  did because all I do is study these scumbags. How Omnicron is changing the rules of the COVID-19
[1:09:28.080 --> 1:09:33.040]  pandemic. Lots of fear mongering there. British surge seen as warning on Omnicron,
[1:09:33.040 --> 1:09:38.960]  but responses vary. There's like less than 20 people in hospitals with the quote Omnicron who
[1:09:38.960 --> 1:09:45.840]  knows that's even real. But they're training you to be scared of your own shadow and only
[1:09:45.840 --> 1:09:53.200]  trustful of people like them. UK health chief a number of years. So first was 15 days flat in
[1:09:53.200 --> 1:09:56.960]  the curve than just a few months where the mass will just a six months. Oh, I'm sorry two years
[1:09:56.960 --> 1:10:06.000]  out three years. Oh, it's it's permanent. It's forever a number of years. Oh, we'll get to more
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:20.560]  of this, but I want to give the number out 8777892539877789 Alex 8777892539 and I want to hear
[1:10:20.560 --> 1:10:31.120]  from you on whatever issue you want to discuss 8777892539. See it right there on your screen.
[1:10:31.120 --> 1:10:35.680]  By the way, that was a half an inch of the articles. I've got
[1:10:38.400 --> 1:10:43.840]  six inches of articles on this stuff. And I've got graphs and government documents and
[1:10:43.840 --> 1:10:47.760]  and I'm going to show you these we already mentioned it yesterday, but the MRIs of people
[1:10:47.760 --> 1:10:51.440]  in cancer research facilities going, hey, we're not against the shots, but
[1:10:52.240 --> 1:10:55.920]  we give people a shot of the Pfizer it like doubles and triples their tumors and weeks and
[1:10:55.920 --> 1:11:02.080]  kills them. I mean, what's going on here? And I laugh about it because this is so sick.
[1:11:05.200 --> 1:11:11.520]  This is Gallo's humor. NYPD arrests six peaceful protesters for entering
[1:11:11.520 --> 1:11:15.840]  cheesecake factory without showing Vax Passport suit will be because they had the wrong
[1:11:15.840 --> 1:11:21.520]  political views or didn't pay their carbon tax video. New York City ice cream shop won't let
[1:11:21.520 --> 1:11:26.320]  children enter without proof of vaccination. Think about this portable people learning about
[1:11:26.320 --> 1:11:31.760]  the new world order. Health minister says hospitalizations and deaths in South Africa remain
[1:11:31.760 --> 1:11:37.600]  low. They've got 6% of the cases of the UK, 4% of the cases of the United States.
[1:11:38.720 --> 1:11:43.360]  And they're only 6% vaccinated. Oh, the higher your vaccinated, the more sick you are. We have
[1:11:43.360 --> 1:11:46.160]  all the statistics and numbers proving it, but it's right there in front of you.
[1:11:47.520 --> 1:11:51.360]  That's why they claim the new strain came out of South Africa was to blame Africa because
[1:11:51.360 --> 1:11:57.280]  Africa is refusing to take the shots. Just 15 people with Omnicron are being treated in UK
[1:11:57.280 --> 1:12:03.120]  hospitals. Yeah, there's the article on infoworks.com. But they tell you it's the tidal wave. It's
[1:12:03.120 --> 1:12:07.360]  mass death. You're all dead. Give your rights up. Meanwhile, the real deaths of the vaccinated
[1:12:07.360 --> 1:12:14.400]  people. Judge holds hospital in contempt, gives ivermectin to dying woman or pay $10,000
[1:12:14.400 --> 1:12:20.960]  in fine a day and all over the country. Judges are ordering ivermectin and saving lives and it's
[1:12:20.960 --> 1:12:28.080]  pissing the hospitals off because they wanted to 53,000 they get just for treating a COVID patient
[1:12:28.080 --> 1:12:38.240]  and close to 80 is 87,000 last time I checked for a death. That's some big cash to murder.
[1:12:39.840 --> 1:12:43.280]  I like this video. We're going to play here in just a moment. Guys, get this queued up.
[1:12:43.280 --> 1:12:50.480]  Man, video bombs, COVID newscasts stop lying to the world. Unknown bystander interrupts
[1:12:50.480 --> 1:12:54.800]  live news broadcasts to tell them to stop spreading fear and propaganda. A man shouted
[1:12:54.800 --> 1:13:00.080]  reporters for lying about the pandemic and creating fear, whether you're in Australia
[1:13:00.080 --> 1:13:07.680]  where this is or anywhere else, non violently take over live TV shows. Just like we did five years
[1:13:07.680 --> 1:13:12.160]  ago on the eve of the election and people took over Bill Clinton's array post everywhere. Remember
[1:13:12.160 --> 1:13:18.160]  the infoworks.com. And you guys did that. Well, this is even more important now. This is about
[1:13:18.160 --> 1:13:22.960]  getting Trump elected. This is about exposing the fraud, exposing the lies. Call into C-span. Call
[1:13:22.960 --> 1:13:28.800]  on the talk radio. Call into the podcast. Go to your city councils. Go to your school board. Speak
[1:13:28.800 --> 1:13:32.400]  out. They want to intimidate you. They want to stop you. They want to gaslight you. They want to
[1:13:32.400 --> 1:13:39.680]  make you feel alone. No, don't do that. Use every venue you can. In fact, I'm going to say it now.
[1:13:40.880 --> 1:13:46.000]  I'm issuing a new bounty. Even though we're maxed out and don't even have the money,
[1:13:46.560 --> 1:13:50.640]  I'll still pay it. And by that, I just sold my house. That's being fed into the operation.
[1:13:50.640 --> 1:13:53.600]  We got the money to pay you. But long term, it might shut us down. But I don't care.
[1:13:54.480 --> 1:13:59.440]  I'm putting a bounty on it. Anybody peacefully, non violently, without breaking any laws,
[1:13:59.440 --> 1:14:01.760]  gets on national or international television
[1:14:04.960 --> 1:14:12.720]  with a, what should the sayings be? As long as infoworks.com is in it. Like,
[1:14:12.720 --> 1:14:19.840]  Fauci created the virus, infoworks.com. Or the vaccine gives you cancer, infoworks.com. Or the
[1:14:19.840 --> 1:14:25.120]  vaccine gives you heart attacks, infoworks.com. Whatever it is, infoworks.com, infoworks.com,
[1:14:25.680 --> 1:14:36.960]  $5,000 bounty. I paid out $380 plus thousand dollars in the 2016 election. And I did it,
[1:14:36.960 --> 1:14:41.920]  smiling like the Cheshire cat. You post it, you get it out there. And back then we still had
[1:14:41.920 --> 1:14:50.000]  YouTube and Facebook and Twitter. You'll have to, I guess, send it to Rob D, ROBD, Rob D, Rob
[1:14:50.000 --> 1:14:56.240]  Dude, it's ROB Than Dude, just the initial. RobD at infoworks.com, showtips.com, we'll find it,
[1:14:56.240 --> 1:15:00.320]  we'll get it on. Post it on YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, wherever you can, just show us you did
[1:15:00.320 --> 1:15:06.400]  it there. Get it out, go and rumble. Do it on rumble. Rumble and gab have good video platforms
[1:15:06.400 --> 1:15:11.200]  that are open to the public. Post it on rumble and gab and post it on one other mainstream
[1:15:11.200 --> 1:15:18.960]  establishment system. And everybody that gets it out will get $5,000 and we paid it out last
[1:15:18.960 --> 1:15:23.840]  time. Oh man, am I worried, boy, I want to pay that money. It's not about me getting the advertising
[1:15:23.840 --> 1:15:28.560]  back. No, it's about letting them know that I'm defiant and I'm not backing down and getting other
[1:15:28.560 --> 1:15:35.200]  people to chain reaction and peacefully, legally, lawfully in public spaces, hijack public events
[1:15:35.200 --> 1:15:40.880]  in legal, lawful, peaceful, loving, liberal way. We're not drag queen story time with competing
[1:15:40.880 --> 1:15:44.960]  pedophiles rushing in to funnel your kids at school without eternal consent. We're not,
[1:15:44.960 --> 1:15:48.560]  that's not civil disobedience. That's criminal. We're not like them. No, no, no. We're just gonna,
[1:15:48.560 --> 1:15:53.200]  you know, do big things on live TV and at the county fair and everywhere else. All right,
[1:15:53.200 --> 1:16:01.440]  the bounty has been issued, my friends. We have developed the research and the tools to stop this
[1:16:01.440 --> 1:16:05.360]  evil and to break free from it and then to help others to break free from it. That's why we've
[1:16:05.360 --> 1:16:10.720]  launched reset wars. Once you simply accept that there is an incredibly evil group of people in
[1:16:10.720 --> 1:16:15.840]  the world that are attempting the great reset and want a one world corporate government,
[1:16:15.840 --> 1:16:22.000]  then you can learn how to defeat them by learning their war game strategies and how to not play the
[1:16:22.000 --> 1:16:28.960]  game. After decades of intense research, our quest to discover the key to breaking the global
[1:16:28.960 --> 1:16:38.560]  response is now live. The reset wars have begun. Start your journey at reset wars.com today.

[1:18:04.400 --> 1:18:09.360]  Chiapas, Mexico, the communists? Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's
[1:18:09.360 --> 1:18:14.720]  wild harvested above organic in the volcanic soil better than Guatemalan coffee. And yeah,
[1:18:14.720 --> 1:18:18.000]  we buy it from the little farmers that you know, the media calls communists, but really,
[1:18:18.000 --> 1:18:21.920]  they're just a commune. And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee and we've got it.
[1:18:21.920 --> 1:18:25.520]  And the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over. So I actually buy this from the Mexican
[1:18:25.520 --> 1:18:29.120]  rebels and I've been buying it for what 14 years and the price has never gone up. The same stuff
[1:18:29.120 --> 1:18:33.680]  sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per pound. And I just think it's some
[1:18:33.680 --> 1:18:38.080]  of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere. It's wake up America Patriot blend from the Chiapas
[1:18:38.080 --> 1:18:41.440]  rebels literally. In fact, I'm going to tell you a little story.
[1:18:44.400 --> 1:18:50.320]  Yeah, like that. Okay, you want to believe it. Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com. And that's how
[1:18:50.320 --> 1:18:53.440]  we fund this operation. And if you don't find us and don't want to stare, that's fine.
[1:18:57.760 --> 1:19:03.840]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalist. I wanted to stop
[1:19:03.840 --> 1:19:09.280]  their agenda. I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went
[1:19:09.280 --> 1:19:14.800]  operational. But we failed. Yes, a lot of people are awake. Yes, we're not getting caught flatfooted,
[1:19:14.800 --> 1:19:20.960]  but they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization, great reset. And
[1:19:20.960 --> 1:19:25.760]  that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know
[1:19:25.760 --> 1:19:30.400]  about the show, because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth. So we've got an
[1:19:30.400 --> 1:19:34.560]  information warfare, the enemy and trying to stop their agenda. We've also got to get personally
[1:19:34.560 --> 1:19:38.560]  prepared. And one of the number one things to do is high quality, storeable food. We've got the best
[1:19:38.560 --> 1:19:43.920]  food ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarstore.com. So whether it's a month or a
[1:19:43.920 --> 1:19:49.120]  six month or a year supply or specialty diets, it's ready to ship right now. Lock your orders in
[1:19:49.120 --> 1:19:54.560]  before food prices go up. And before there are long lines and waits, because believe me, serious
[1:19:54.560 --> 1:20:02.640]  times are coming. Get ready at infowarstore.com. Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the
[1:20:02.640 --> 1:20:29.920]  New World Order. It's Alex Jones. All right. Project Veritas has just released a new video.
[1:20:29.920 --> 1:20:35.200]  It's going live on infowarstore.com as we speak. We'll have it added to the live show feed area.
[1:20:36.160 --> 1:20:42.880]  Guess what it is? Spin the wheel. Is it CNN's been caught purposely lying again?
[1:20:42.880 --> 1:20:48.320]  CNN's plunged in the ratings to an all time low of like 5,000 viewers. CNN got knocked out of
[1:20:48.320 --> 1:21:00.640]  airports, which already happened. CNN got caught running pedophile rings. Yeah, that's the one.
[1:21:00.640 --> 1:21:08.400]  Another CNN producer shopping children to people. See, I told you reportedly, allegedly, this is
[1:21:08.400 --> 1:21:15.280]  not about having sex with children. It's about a cult. And so we're going to be talking about that.
[1:21:15.280 --> 1:21:21.120]  But I want to go to Shelby and Bone Crusher and Sid Kanu. We've got a lot of crazy names
[1:21:21.120 --> 1:21:27.520]  there. And Brian and Corey and Kaya. Got a lot of wild names today there. I hope I'm pronouncing
[1:21:27.520 --> 1:21:38.240]  them all correctly, ladies and gentlemen. So what should we go to first here? Let's go to Bone
[1:21:38.240 --> 1:21:45.760]  Crusher and FEMA Region 10. Bone Crusher, welcome. Hey, Alex. Great to be talking with you again.
[1:21:45.760 --> 1:21:52.240]  Yes, sir. Go ahead. Hey. So just when I think about info wars, there's a Gandhi quote that I
[1:21:52.240 --> 1:21:59.680]  always think about. And it goes, first they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you,
[1:21:59.680 --> 1:22:05.280]  then you win. And that just pretty much sums up the battle that you seem to be going with and
[1:22:05.280 --> 1:22:12.160]  the route you're going on here. Well, I totally agree with you. You know, I just hope that we,
[1:22:12.160 --> 1:22:16.800]  I personally get to see the promised land on the other side, which I probably won't. But
[1:22:17.680 --> 1:22:21.440]  certainly, tyranny always falls. That's why they're trying to create an unnatural human
[1:22:21.440 --> 1:22:25.760]  condition where we're like lab rats, so that we're totally programmed for birth. They believe,
[1:22:25.760 --> 1:22:30.240]  finally, the tyrants will have control under transhumanism. And that's really,
[1:22:30.240 --> 1:22:35.680]  everything we're seeing is transhumanism. You're 100% correct, Alex. I mean,
[1:22:36.640 --> 1:22:42.880]  it's just funny to me how much people keep doubting you and how much it's the Alex Jones
[1:22:44.000 --> 1:22:48.400]  was right. But then it's gotten to the point where Alex Jones was right again.
[1:22:49.200 --> 1:22:52.880]  That's what it is now. Well, listen, I really wasn't even right. I was going off their own
[1:22:52.880 --> 1:22:57.680]  plans, identified who controls things. Many others better than I did, confirmed who they were before
[1:22:57.680 --> 1:23:02.640]  I was even born. And here we are. Thank you so much for your call and have a great Christmas
[1:23:02.640 --> 1:23:09.440]  coming up, Bone Crusher. Great points. First day, I forget the Gandhi quote. He said it,
[1:23:09.440 --> 1:23:17.600]  but then I always paraphrase it wrong. It was, first they ignore you, then they laugh at you,
[1:23:18.320 --> 1:23:22.960]  then they attack you, then you win. I think that's the right quote. Guys, pull up the
[1:23:22.960 --> 1:23:28.800]  Gandhi quote about first they attack you or the Gandhi quote, then you win. Then you win,
[1:23:28.800 --> 1:23:32.560]  probably pull it up. There it is. First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you,
[1:23:32.560 --> 1:23:37.680]  then you win. There you go. So there's the actual quote. And that's totally right. Now,
[1:23:37.680 --> 1:23:41.920]  I'm going to a caller that I think is disagreeing with me or at least is critical, which I love
[1:23:41.920 --> 1:23:48.640]  those because that helps me be a better person. And they're asking, Oscar in Oklahoma has a question,
[1:23:48.640 --> 1:23:54.240]  why are you charging money for reset wars? And let me answer the question that I'll go to him.
[1:23:55.360 --> 1:24:01.520]  If you're sending somebody into combat, you got to provide them with a uniform, a weapon, food,
[1:24:02.400 --> 1:24:09.760]  their mess kit, their supplies, and the mission they're on and the training. And so we're not like
[1:24:09.760 --> 1:24:14.560]  the IRS coming and making you pay money. We're not coming. We have to pay for the cameras,
[1:24:14.560 --> 1:24:20.240]  the lights, the server farms we're building overseas in the US that have cost millions of
[1:24:20.240 --> 1:24:26.320]  dollars, millions, millions to build our own infrastructure, to do our own thing.
[1:24:26.320 --> 1:24:31.200]  Trump hasn't been able to do it because he has saboteurs. If we had $2 billion like he just
[1:24:31.200 --> 1:24:37.200]  raised for his new social network three months ago, we'd have it like that. It takes 100 person
[1:24:37.200 --> 1:24:41.120]  teams to design, you know, the type of things we're trying to do. And we've got a bunch of stuff
[1:24:41.120 --> 1:24:46.560]  that's basically built that we're now getting ready to deploy in the next month. So I'm very
[1:24:46.560 --> 1:24:52.560]  pregnant. Info wars is very like nine months pregnant, folks. And basically, using analogy,
[1:24:52.560 --> 1:24:57.360]  info wars, water is already broke. We're in labor right now with a bunch of projects,
[1:24:57.360 --> 1:25:02.080]  not just the films like COVID land we're producing, you know, not just a bunch of other
[1:25:02.080 --> 1:25:09.440]  stuff that's about to launch, not just reset wars, but so much that by the latter part of January,
[1:25:09.440 --> 1:25:14.480]  so I'm out letting congressional subpoenas and, you know, IRS attacks and all of it, you know,
[1:25:14.480 --> 1:25:21.520]  keep me on my mission. You're going to see a bunch of new things pop out. And when you're under
[1:25:21.520 --> 1:25:25.440]  attack and they're trying to kill you, that's what you do. You have babies. And so I'm here like
[1:25:25.440 --> 1:25:31.840]  literally, I'll give you an analogy. I'm like a big queen bee with all the eggs here. And I'm like,
[1:25:31.840 --> 1:25:39.040]  give me food, feed me. I'm ready to get crushed and stepped on. But my babies are already flying
[1:25:39.040 --> 1:25:44.240]  out of the nest as fast as they can go. I mean, I'll use the queen bee analogy because it's,
[1:25:44.240 --> 1:25:47.440]  I'm very masculine. But if you want to talk about it, info wars like a big queen bee.
[1:25:47.440 --> 1:25:52.160]  And I'm just sitting here. And I've got a bunch of eggs I'm finishing. I'm like, feed me,
[1:25:52.160 --> 1:25:58.400]  feed me, see more, feed me, feed me. And that's what's going on here. So I need you to feed us
[1:25:59.040 --> 1:26:03.600]  so that we can continue to deliver victory. It's not like you bet on some horse that loses. It's
[1:26:03.600 --> 1:26:08.160]  not like you're over here trying to plant grapes in a field that doesn't create incredible grapes.
[1:26:09.760 --> 1:26:15.920]  The vines do well here. We're in the fight. But I have to build infrastructure to get the knowledge
[1:26:15.920 --> 1:26:22.160]  out, especially in the censorship world. I mean, the caller is absolutely right. If I had Instagram
[1:26:22.160 --> 1:26:26.560]  and Facebook and Twitter, I could sit there at my house say amazing things that people resonate with
[1:26:26.560 --> 1:26:30.000]  and have hundreds of millions of followers and change the world. They don't let me have access
[1:26:30.000 --> 1:26:34.240]  to that brother. And so I could either be on this show and reach millions of people now,
[1:26:34.240 --> 1:26:39.680]  and despite of their tyranny, or I could be downtown with a sandwich board yelling at people,
[1:26:40.240 --> 1:26:43.920]  which if they ever take me off air, I'll be doing that. You can be assured of that.
[1:26:43.920 --> 1:26:46.640]  So does that answer your question, Oscar in Oklahoma?
[1:26:50.000 --> 1:26:55.840]  Oscar Mike in Oklahoma to a point it does. Alex, let me preface this with this. I love you guys.
[1:26:55.840 --> 1:27:01.840]  You guys are light years ahead in information. You have red pilled millions of people,
[1:27:02.560 --> 1:27:10.160]  but it seems to me that it's this reset wars. I understand you have to generate funds to
[1:27:10.160 --> 1:27:17.760]  maintain your platform because of the censorship. But what gets me is charging people for so-called
[1:27:17.760 --> 1:27:24.560]  secrets of the ferrocytical education system. It seems very, very ferristy to say that I've
[1:27:24.560 --> 1:27:29.600]  got these prayers in this private little thing that I'm going to charge you money for.
[1:27:29.600 --> 1:27:33.520]  Where in the Bible does it say that we are to charge people for spiritual,
[1:27:33.520 --> 1:27:38.080]  intellectual information? It doesn't. It just seems to me that it doesn't.
[1:27:38.080 --> 1:27:44.000]  Well, let's be one million percent clear. I'm not a preacher, and I'm not all these 50,000
[1:27:44.000 --> 1:27:48.720]  denominations fighting with each other, saying they're the right preacher. They're the right
[1:27:48.720 --> 1:27:53.200]  preacher. That's not what this is. In the fact, in six plus hours, I say a few prayers and try to
[1:27:53.200 --> 1:27:58.640]  get people to believe in God. It's just ridiculous to say that it's there. If people want to buy
[1:27:58.640 --> 1:28:02.480]  the course that the system is trying to suppress, they can, which then helps keep us on air.
[1:28:03.600 --> 1:28:09.600]  People can go buy lottery tickets. That's fine. Or go spend thousands of dollars to see
[1:28:09.600 --> 1:28:13.360]  George Strait. That's fine and normal. Or thousands of dollars to go to Cancun.
[1:28:13.360 --> 1:28:17.600]  But you charge a couple hundred dollars to really put out a six-hour powerful course
[1:28:17.600 --> 1:28:21.840]  with the whole infrastructure to get it out, and then that's bad in the devil. I'll say it.
[1:28:21.840 --> 1:28:26.080]  I'm a sinner. I'm bad. I appreciate your call. And that's it. I'm the devil. Don't watch resetwars.com.
[1:28:26.080 --> 1:28:32.640]  It's just, it's ridiculous. And that's why people that are Christians never get anything done
[1:28:32.640 --> 1:28:36.560]  because they're too busy trying to prove how they're holier than them. I'm not holier than them.
[1:28:36.560 --> 1:28:41.840]  I've been with hundreds of women. I beat people's brains out. I've been a bunch of them, but I love
[1:28:41.840 --> 1:28:47.600]  Jesus. And I'm trying to love God and be good right now. And you judge a tree by the fruits.
[1:28:47.600 --> 1:28:53.280]  Okay. So resetwars is not some new religion. Resetwars is how the globals are programming you.
[1:28:56.800 --> 1:29:03.760]  So many people say to me, Alex, so this could be literally your last chance with all the insane
[1:29:03.760 --> 1:29:10.000]  things happening in the world to get in force products and to support us into 2022, the do or die
[1:29:10.000 --> 1:29:16.000]  year, store wide free shipping, double patriot points, brain force, plus 50% off, amazing,
[1:29:16.000 --> 1:29:20.480]  new tropic, ultimate krill oil, back in stock, highest rated krill oil. So good for your whole
[1:29:20.480 --> 1:29:26.880]  body. 50% off. We've got knockout sleep support 50% off, hair and beard support 60% off. We also
[1:29:26.880 --> 1:29:33.040]  have COVID land to the mask film. When you order the very important film, you get a free DVD with
[1:29:33.040 --> 1:29:38.880]  two films on it about Bohemian grow turbo force, 10 hour clean energy, 40% off body's ultimate
[1:29:38.880 --> 1:29:46.400]  turmeric formula, 40% off DNA force plus the world's Royce for your cells and immune systems, 40%
[1:29:46.400 --> 1:29:52.800]  off info wars store.com. This could be potentially your last chance to get a t-shirt, a book, a film,
[1:29:52.800 --> 1:29:56.720]  or these great supplements. We're going to keep going 110% but we need your support.
[1:30:00.400 --> 1:30:06.560]  This could be info wars last Christmas because it could be America's last Christmas. Evil is
[1:30:06.560 --> 1:30:10.880]  taking over the planet. They're destroying our borders, our sovereignty, our supply chains,
[1:30:10.880 --> 1:30:16.720]  our language, our currencies. They're coming after us. And if we don't support American businesses,
[1:30:16.720 --> 1:30:21.680]  and if we don't support independent media in the final days of 2021, we have no future in the
[1:30:21.680 --> 1:30:29.120]  midterms in 2022. 2022 is the year where America decides its faith. I want to thank you all for
[1:30:29.120 --> 1:30:33.600]  your support. I want to encourage you to your Christmas shopping and for store.com because I
[1:30:33.600 --> 1:30:39.040]  can barely keep our operation going. And I appreciate you keeping us in the position to fight back. I

[1:31:01.120 --> 1:31:06.320]  They're here all over the world from Australia to the United States from Canada to Germany.
[1:31:06.320 --> 1:31:10.400]  These tyrants are tracking everything you do everywhere you go and then coming to your house
[1:31:10.400 --> 1:31:16.720]  and threatening in some cases actually taking people away into the night to their facilities.
[1:31:16.720 --> 1:31:21.520]  And they're planning the next year to expand their shield process where they come and take
[1:31:21.520 --> 1:31:25.920]  quote healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety. This is nothing
[1:31:25.920 --> 1:31:31.280]  less than martial law. And one big thing you do to fight back is to get high quality Faraday cages,
[1:31:31.280 --> 1:31:35.840]  many of which are made here in America and are very compliant, meaning us government military

[1:31:59.920 --> 1:32:07.040]  God created each and every one of us with free will. But we look at the world system now openly
[1:32:07.040 --> 1:32:12.480]  announcing the mark of the beast. Everything that it's attempting to do is built around getting rid
[1:32:12.480 --> 1:32:19.200]  of our free will and making us bow down and submit and turn our very bodies are very productivity
[1:32:19.200 --> 1:32:28.080]  are very genetics are very future over to them. They want control of procreation. They want control
[1:32:28.080 --> 1:32:32.880]  of the relationships between men and women. They want to bring a form of living death
[1:32:32.880 --> 1:32:39.280]  to our society and our civilization. All of us were formed and made in God's mind and God's
[1:32:39.280 --> 1:32:44.800]  image and given free will and make no mistake. All of you alive today were created by God to
[1:32:44.800 --> 1:32:50.560]  be alive in this special time so that you could make the right decision free will and stand against
[1:32:50.560 --> 1:32:57.840]  evil. And then fraternity win the great birthright prize of being aligned with God.
[1:33:00.080 --> 1:33:06.080]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's Alex Jones.
[1:33:06.080 --> 1:33:17.520]  Live from the info wars.com studios. It's Alex Jones.
[1:33:17.520 --> 1:33:36.960]  It is a reprogramming mutagen that goes into the nucleus your cell and reprograms it.
[1:33:38.080 --> 1:33:43.200]  And they admit the trials. It kills a lot of the animals they tested on. But that's okay.
[1:33:43.200 --> 1:33:49.680]  Because Bill Gates said a month ago we played the clip probably 30 times. He said yeah a lot
[1:33:49.680 --> 1:33:58.240]  of people are sick and die but it don't matter because you're gonna take it. They got some new
[1:33:58.240 --> 1:34:05.520]  vaccines that go in and eat parts of your brain. I feel so good. Yeah you're not gonna have to wait
[1:34:05.520 --> 1:34:14.000]  any more all year and an aisle. It's here now. Oh and the globalists are Satan worse. And pedophiles.
[1:34:14.000 --> 1:34:19.360]  Well of course they are because we got a transmission 2000 years ago warning us.
[1:34:20.000 --> 1:34:25.520]  You see there's not just devils in the universe. There's somebody a lot more powerful.
[1:34:29.840 --> 1:34:32.720]  All right so you heard the last caller. I want to give some rest to the callers and I'm not mad
[1:34:32.720 --> 1:34:37.680]  at the caller but the idea of how do you charge for information. When you pay for your cable
[1:34:37.680 --> 1:34:43.200]  bill you pay for Fox News and CNN. We're on radio stations. That's free. We're on the internet.
[1:34:43.200 --> 1:34:46.720]  We're putting our own videos out. We're paying for our own infrastructure. Our own satellites.
[1:34:46.720 --> 1:34:50.720]  Our own servers. Our own legal everything. And I'm not mad at the listeners. You're wonderful.
[1:34:50.720 --> 1:34:54.400]  Thanks for keeping us on air. But the idea that how are you charging for knowledge.
[1:34:57.360 --> 1:35:01.680]  Well how am I supposed to pay for the servers and pay for the crew and pay for the emails and
[1:35:01.680 --> 1:35:09.120]  pay for it all to get it out. That's how the world works. Here's an analogy. Is it ferrocytical.
[1:35:10.400 --> 1:35:14.000]  The caller uses that term and I'll explain what that means in a moment for those that may not know.
[1:35:15.120 --> 1:35:23.440]  I'll give you my perspective. He says isn't it ferrocytical to charge to talk about God.
[1:35:24.240 --> 1:35:28.560]  Well no the Pharisees were making people buy a certain coin that was in limited supply
[1:35:28.560 --> 1:35:34.320]  for many times what the coin was worth in silver to be able to buy sacrifices for the
[1:35:34.320 --> 1:35:38.960]  temple in Jerusalem. I'm not at the temple in Jerusalem. I'm not at a church saying you must
[1:35:38.960 --> 1:35:43.280]  have this sacrifice to atone to God and you must buy it a certain coin from me.
[1:35:46.240 --> 1:35:48.000]  I'm not claiming I'm some high priest.
[1:35:51.520 --> 1:35:55.200]  Here's another example. Let's say so many of the big schools in America were founded by
[1:35:55.200 --> 1:36:00.720]  Christians got taken over later but the point is you send your child to a college that's been a
[1:36:00.720 --> 1:36:08.640]  Christian school like Baylor in Texas and you pay for your tuition and then there's a church
[1:36:10.400 --> 1:36:14.480]  chapel on that facility. Is your argument you shouldn't pay to send your child to Baylor?
[1:36:15.680 --> 1:36:19.120]  Maybe you shouldn't because the brainwashing that goes on there that's your choice but
[1:36:19.120 --> 1:36:25.680]  the idea that it's ferrocytical. The Pharisees were always pointing out how someone else wasn't
[1:36:25.680 --> 1:36:31.040]  of God. The Pharisees were always pointing out how someone had violated God's rules and how they
[1:36:31.040 --> 1:36:37.200]  were high and mighty and how they were good. I'm the opposite of a Pharisee. People say
[1:36:37.200 --> 1:36:41.520]  Jones why do you admit you paid for abortions? Well because I'm very sad about it. I repent of
[1:36:41.520 --> 1:36:48.160]  it and happened 30 years ago and God touched my heart and convicted me and I said no and I've
[1:36:48.160 --> 1:36:55.760]  been part of it since. A Pharisee doesn't tell you they killed their children. A Pharisee doesn't
[1:36:55.760 --> 1:37:01.840]  tell you that they've done the things I've done. If I'm anything in this universe it's not a Pharisee.
[1:37:02.800 --> 1:37:09.120]  Anything. So I don't take umbrage with the person saying I'm being a Pharisee. It's just you've got
[1:37:09.120 --> 1:37:23.200]  it backwards brother and I would not compare myself to King David. I'm not saying I'm like this amazing
[1:37:23.200 --> 1:37:30.480]  as King David was and what an incredible Christ-like person who sent his friend off to get murdered
[1:37:30.480 --> 1:37:36.080]  because he was so overcome with lust for his wife. Now I never had one of my buddies killed so I
[1:37:36.080 --> 1:37:41.920]  could have sex with his wife but see he legitimately got caught up in it and then repented and was
[1:37:41.920 --> 1:37:47.120]  and God could read his heart and knew he was sorry for real and God said you're a man after my own heart.
[1:37:49.760 --> 1:37:56.640]  So let's just say over here's Pharisees and over here's Alex Jones and over here's King David.
[1:37:56.640 --> 1:38:04.240]  Like I'm on the King David spectrum. I want women. I want to fight but I also love God and
[1:38:04.240 --> 1:38:08.480]  freedom and I don't have to screw little people over. I want to take on big guys. I want to take on
[1:38:08.480 --> 1:38:14.800]  Goliath. God hates cowards. King David was not a coward. So you see that's the difference. So
[1:38:14.800 --> 1:38:19.680]  you want to compare me to somebody who was a sinner. Compare me to King David. Don't you ever
[1:38:20.400 --> 1:38:26.080]  think that it's true if you compare me to one of the Pharisees when it's the Pharisees that are
[1:38:26.080 --> 1:38:33.040]  coming after me today and when it is literally the ADL New World Order Globalist System that
[1:38:33.040 --> 1:38:40.720]  hates my guts. It's the left in Hollywood that tells you about the rules and how you're dirty
[1:38:40.720 --> 1:38:44.400]  and how you're bad and how you haven't done enough when they themselves are the worst.
[1:38:45.600 --> 1:38:49.760]  They'll tell you how good they are all day. Brother I'm here to tell you the reason I'm
[1:38:49.760 --> 1:38:58.080]  able to fight the New World Order is because I'm evil. My mind is satanic. I can see into
[1:38:58.080 --> 1:39:02.160]  their operations. I know how they work. I understand them and I'm not proud of it. I don't like it
[1:39:02.160 --> 1:39:06.960]  because for all that evil I know there's this side of good that's way bigger and beautiful.
[1:39:06.960 --> 1:39:11.840]  Like Dr. Zolinko says is a little birdie that just loves God and just loves puppies and kitty
[1:39:11.840 --> 1:39:17.360]  cats and blue skies and happy corn fields and just campfires and everybody's singing happy.
[1:39:17.360 --> 1:39:21.920]  That's why I want to be little birdie, little sweet birdie with Jesus.
[1:39:26.640 --> 1:39:30.960]  But I do know about the devil and I said I'd go to your calls. We'll push our guests back 15
[1:39:30.960 --> 1:39:35.040]  minutes because I got to get to all these calls. The guests are amazing. The producer and the
[1:39:35.040 --> 1:39:41.040]  director of COVID-Land will do 45 minutes with them ahead of the great guest host that's taken
[1:39:41.040 --> 1:39:47.440]  over and Paul Watson is hosting some tomorrow. But you know, am I ashamed
[1:39:50.640 --> 1:39:55.440]  to sell a course online at resetwars.com that's powerful information
[1:39:55.440 --> 1:40:01.040]  that also keeps us on air and the answer is absolutely not. Am I ashamed that when I, somebody
[1:40:01.040 --> 1:40:05.360]  physically attacked me when I was 16 years old and I finally got them down, I went ahead and just
[1:40:05.360 --> 1:40:13.120]  kicked them a few more times in the head and ruined the rest of their life. No, I'm not proud of that.
[1:40:13.120 --> 1:40:18.800]  So when the Pharisees call and accuse me and I'm not saying you're a Pharisee, but it's a spirit
[1:40:18.800 --> 1:40:26.160]  of a Pharisee. Before you asked me to get the spec out of my eye, you should get the beam out
[1:40:26.160 --> 1:40:30.480]  of your eye. And I will tell that caller this, they must have bought the course to even know
[1:40:30.480 --> 1:40:35.600]  that information. Thank you for your support, sir. And I get it. It's a little unseemly seeing me
[1:40:35.600 --> 1:40:41.520]  up there trying to get people to come to Jesus. It's quite a spectacle, isn't it? Because I mean
[1:40:41.520 --> 1:40:45.360]  anybody that's got discernment can look at Alex Jones and say there's something about that guy.
[1:40:45.360 --> 1:40:50.960]  He's good, but he's also really bad. I can almost see a forked tail and you're absolutely right.
[1:40:50.960 --> 1:41:02.160]  I am a devil. I am a fallen devil. I am absolutely a devil. But you know what? Jesus redeemed me
[1:41:02.160 --> 1:41:06.800]  and Christ saved me. But yeah, I'm still in the third dimension. I'm still right here. I still get
[1:41:06.800 --> 1:41:11.440]  it all. That's why I see right through Cuomo and right through CNN and right through all of them.
[1:41:11.440 --> 1:41:16.400]  Right through all of them. Because I know who they are, folks. I can dial into their frequency.
[1:41:16.400 --> 1:41:23.200]  I can tune in to them. And I can hear their plans. And I know their plans. And I'm frustrated
[1:41:23.200 --> 1:41:27.360]  because we need to move on from Alex Jones. And is Alex Jones good or is Alex Jones bad?
[1:41:27.360 --> 1:41:32.720]  And understand, I'm bad. I'm a fallen creature, but I'm saved through Christ. Let's move on from
[1:41:32.720 --> 1:41:37.440]  Alex Jones. And let's move on to your relationship with Jesus Christ and your relationship in the
[1:41:37.440 --> 1:41:42.720]  universe and what you're going to do about the future. Let's not use Alex Jones as an excuse
[1:41:42.720 --> 1:41:47.200]  on whether God and the devil are real. God and the devil are real. Let's move on from Jones.
[1:41:47.200 --> 1:41:50.800]  And let's decide whether we want to be with God forever or the devil forever.
[1:41:53.040 --> 1:41:57.520]  And that's my message to the Pharisees. Because I am in the quiet place of the most eye
[1:41:58.160 --> 1:42:03.520]  until I get on air. And I'm so frustrated. I'm so calm and smooth. And I understand I'm just
[1:42:03.520 --> 1:42:07.760]  quietly reading for hours. And then I got to come on air. I don't want to be your priest.
[1:42:07.760 --> 1:42:11.280]  I don't want to be your leader. I don't want to be up here telling you about all this. I want you
[1:42:11.280 --> 1:42:16.560]  to wake up and stop it. I want you to save me. Because God put us on this earth to either choose
[1:42:16.560 --> 1:42:21.120]  good or evil and then either work for evil together or serve God together. Can we just serve
[1:42:21.120 --> 1:42:25.280]  God together? Can we just agree we love Jesus and love God and love justice? And can we just stop
[1:42:25.280 --> 1:42:31.120]  this evil? Resetwars.com. Resetwars.com. They've tried to stop it. They've tried to block it.
[1:42:31.120 --> 1:42:34.560]  Thank you so much for your support, those that you that got it, including the caller that called in.
[1:42:34.560 --> 1:42:40.400]  And I'm just asking you to continue to be supporting us at infowars.com. Whether it's books or

[1:43:34.880 --> 1:43:39.440]  It even tastes better. Don't ask formula. And what it does for your body is simply amazing.
[1:43:39.440 --> 1:43:45.600]  Again, it has that cutting edge, chicken broth, protein, isolate powder for better flavor and

[1:43:54.320 --> 1:44:01.360]  best bone broth out there. So get yours at infowarstore.com today. It's only been in the last 60 years
[1:44:01.360 --> 1:44:06.160]  that we've had satellites that can decently measure what's happening in the atmosphere.
[1:44:06.880 --> 1:44:10.480]  But if you look at all the different studies of reports about my NASA and other governments and
[1:44:10.480 --> 1:44:15.760]  other agencies, they all disagree on what's really happening with the climate. The only constant,
[1:44:15.760 --> 1:44:23.120]  the only great truth is change is the only constant. So yes, climate change is totally real.
[1:44:23.120 --> 1:44:26.880]  But notice first they called it global freezing back in the 70s, 80s, and then
[1:44:26.880 --> 1:44:30.000]  it's going to be global warming. And when that didn't really happen the way they wanted to,
[1:44:30.000 --> 1:44:35.760]  okay, now it's just climate change. But did you know that manmade climate change is a real thing
[1:44:36.320 --> 1:44:41.440]  when it comes to the United Nations and the Department of Energy and Bill Gates and the UN?
[1:44:41.440 --> 1:44:46.880]  They have. Weather control trees from 1979 and Bill Gates has been manipulating the weather
[1:44:46.880 --> 1:44:52.320]  for a very long time. In fact, back in 1994, two scientists won a Nobel Prize for an idea of spraying
[1:44:52.320 --> 1:44:57.120]  different particles out of jet engines to control the weather. So yes, manmade climate change is real.
[1:45:02.480 --> 1:45:06.160]  Granny Do Right. Granny Do Right. Thanks for holding her on the air. Go ahead.
[1:45:06.160 --> 1:45:11.760]  Challenge. First of all, let me say I love your products. I am a granny and for all the
[1:45:11.760 --> 1:45:16.720]  senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded up with
[1:45:16.720 --> 1:45:22.640]  sunspots or H-spots as they're lovingly called. But since taking your X2 for the last couple of
[1:45:22.640 --> 1:45:30.240]  years, my skin is just really gorgeous, actually. People think I'm 55 years old. And I was already
[1:45:30.240 --> 1:45:34.560]  taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do
[1:45:34.560 --> 1:45:39.040]  because I just thought it was a hopeless situation. But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't
[1:45:39.040 --> 1:45:44.720]  happen immediately. But, you know, over a period of time, I started noticing, okay, you know,
[1:45:44.720 --> 1:45:50.240]  this is the ticket. This is working. This is wonderful. You know, I don't have to put on
[1:45:50.240 --> 1:45:56.720]  derma blend anymore, you know. So anyway, it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[1:46:00.400 --> 1:46:04.320]  This is a great sponsor. We have one of the best deals you're going to find out there

[1:46:34.720 --> 1:46:41.120]  folks call you. You just pay $99.95 a month for your minutes, $150 minutes. So the calls
[1:46:41.120 --> 1:46:44.400]  you are free works like a regular cell phone. You're not being tracked or traced. And I keep
[1:46:44.400 --> 1:46:48.400]  one in my car. I've given it to my parents as gifts way out the middle of nowhere where regular
[1:46:48.400 --> 1:46:56.720]  phones don't work. They work infowarsphone.com or 941-955-1029-4195-1020 and ask the Alex Jones special.
[1:46:56.720 --> 1:47:06.480]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:16.400 --> 1:47:20.080]  Look, I want to go to your phone calls, but during the break to respond to the last caller,
[1:47:20.080 --> 1:47:26.640]  because it's such a bizarre thing to actually say with a free market show that's open to the public,
[1:47:26.640 --> 1:47:30.960]  that people choose to buy something they can. This idea that as Christians, as conservatives,
[1:47:30.960 --> 1:47:35.120]  as nationalists, that we're not supposed to bring in money is why we've been defeated. We don't have
[1:47:35.120 --> 1:47:41.760]  the infrastructure. Reason one, we need funding to keep the show running and bringing this
[1:47:41.760 --> 1:47:46.800]  information and our supply chain of shipping products is massively delayed. So this is the
[1:47:46.800 --> 1:47:51.760]  best way for us to provide you with powerful information to help you more than just bringing
[1:47:51.760 --> 1:47:57.280]  you the news, but also providing you with the opportunity to show us how much you support
[1:47:57.280 --> 1:48:01.840]  what we're doing and to help others get the truth and help inform them and to keep the
[1:48:01.840 --> 1:48:06.480]  show on the air and the movement we built together and the movement we're leading together.
[1:48:06.480 --> 1:48:11.680]  I kind of wrote this quite during the break. Reason two, people value what they invest in.
[1:48:13.440 --> 1:48:18.080]  We would love to give everything away for free, but people won't value it as much
[1:48:18.080 --> 1:48:24.320]  and won't be able to keep the lights on and bring you any of this information, this critical
[1:48:24.320 --> 1:48:29.920]  information, this urgent information in the future with these crazy times that are happening and
[1:48:29.920 --> 1:48:35.920]  to navigate these unprecedented developments. Since they deplatform me, I have to create ways
[1:48:35.920 --> 1:48:42.960]  to serve you guys and still bring in revenue to our show and our amazing team who helps make
[1:48:42.960 --> 1:48:49.920]  this all happen for us, for you. I mean, that's really it. It's just such a babylike statement
[1:48:49.920 --> 1:48:58.320]  like why are you selling something? What? And I don't want to go back to that anymore. It's just that
[1:49:00.240 --> 1:49:03.440]  I'm glad that person called in though and I'm glad I went to them. I saw what they had to say,
[1:49:03.440 --> 1:49:08.400]  I went to them because I'm proud of what we've done. I wish I'd done better and I wish back four or
[1:49:08.400 --> 1:49:11.840]  five years ago before we were really deplatformed, I tried to raise money. Back then, I'm like,
[1:49:11.840 --> 1:49:15.120]  well, we have enough money to run. I just see myself as we're going to be pulled up.
[1:49:15.120 --> 1:49:19.040]  That's my job. I'm not the leader. I'm just a Paul Revere. And then back then,
[1:49:19.040 --> 1:49:22.080]  if I'd tried to make money, I could have raised hundreds of millions of dollars.
[1:49:22.720 --> 1:49:27.360]  But I was always just, well, we don't need more money. We're not even taking sponsorship right
[1:49:27.360 --> 1:49:34.000]  now. We're just going to be here and boy, now do I know how wrong I was. Now we got to fight hard
[1:49:34.000 --> 1:49:39.920]  to get money to stay on air. So I'm done talking about it. I want the callers. Callers can address
[1:49:39.920 --> 1:49:42.960]  it if you want, but I don't want to turn this into the whole show. So that tends to happen
[1:49:42.960 --> 1:49:46.560]  with calls. Somebody brings something up like that. And, you know, just God bless that fellow.
[1:49:47.440 --> 1:49:52.000]  You know, I hope that he's able to reach people with no money or no infrastructure.
[1:49:52.000 --> 1:49:55.200]  And maybe through the Lord, he's got a way to do it. I haven't figured it out yet,
[1:49:55.840 --> 1:50:01.280]  but that's where we are. Okay, let's go to Shelby in Oklahoma.
[1:50:01.280 --> 1:50:13.280]  Hey, Alex, good to talk to you. First time caller. I did want to say that I know you said
[1:50:13.280 --> 1:50:18.880]  you don't want to be our leader, but you have no choice, man. You are our leader. You are the
[1:50:18.880 --> 1:50:25.920]  captain of the ship. Well, there's no doubt the globalists see me as a major leader. I'm just
[1:50:25.920 --> 1:50:32.240]  trying to lead people to wake up and wake others up. I'm trying to cause a chain reaction. Well,
[1:50:32.240 --> 1:50:39.600]  what I really called it to ask you was with the holidays coming up, how do you interact with your
[1:50:39.600 --> 1:50:44.800]  family in a way that I know you had said before that you had vaccinated family members who are
[1:50:45.440 --> 1:50:52.240]  experiencing some troubles from that, but how do you even, they know who you are. They know.
[1:50:52.240 --> 1:50:57.280]  Well, look, most of my family has not taken the shot, but I've got some that haven't gotten
[1:50:57.280 --> 1:51:01.680]  seriously ill from it, like cousins and people. Yeah. And so we just, I mean, none of us are
[1:51:01.680 --> 1:51:06.320]  living in fantasy land. We take our vitamin D, we try to exercise, we're aware of what's going on.
[1:51:07.360 --> 1:51:13.360]  And I mean, that's basically it, brother. How do you, how do you talk to them and how do you
[1:51:13.360 --> 1:51:22.320]  keep it peaceful in times like this? You know, the few family members I have that are totally
[1:51:22.320 --> 1:51:26.400]  committed to this lie, I don't think even want to come around me anymore. So they've kind of separated
[1:51:26.400 --> 1:51:33.600]  themselves. That's what I found with, with people that I'm around and family members as well as
[1:51:33.600 --> 1:51:39.200]  they just kind of avoid me like the plague, or they even just avoid this conversation like the
[1:51:39.200 --> 1:51:45.440]  plague, because maybe they just can't handle it or, or I'm not sure, but what's happened is they
[1:51:45.440 --> 1:51:50.080]  bought into the lie that if they took this, they'd be fine. But now it's more and more and so
[1:51:50.080 --> 1:51:54.400]  someone who's already been con gets deeper into the con. They, a lot of times they don't say,
[1:51:54.400 --> 1:51:58.800]  Oh, I got con. Oh, I met up into fraud and they make excuses for why it's happened.
[1:51:59.760 --> 1:52:04.800]  Like they just can't accept it. It's so horrible. What's happened. They can't believe it. Thank
[1:52:04.800 --> 1:52:10.880]  you for the call. God bless you. Carlos is a regular caller for over a decade in Ontario,
[1:52:10.880 --> 1:52:16.240]  Canada. Carlos, thanks for holding you're on the air. Thank you, Alex. Actually, Montreal, Canada,
[1:52:17.040 --> 1:52:25.120]  where is the home of the, um, Allen Memorial Hospital. Yeah, they put Ontario on the screen. So
[1:52:25.120 --> 1:52:31.440]  you're in Montreal. The Allen Memorial Hospital is a psychiatric teaching hospital is right
[1:52:31.440 --> 1:52:36.720]  next to the Montreal Neurological Institute. And in between is the Royal Victoria Hospital up on,
[1:52:36.720 --> 1:52:43.360]  on the mountain, Mount Royal. And, uh, I just wanted to draw your attention to, uh, what a bad
[1:52:43.360 --> 1:52:49.760]  technology, bad theory, bad science, uh, how it becomes in one way positive and another way it
[1:52:49.760 --> 1:52:56.480]  creates monsters. Okay. Uh, we, I was driving through Switzerland, um, and to Germany when I saw
[1:52:56.480 --> 1:53:02.240]  a truck with a big, big sign on it saying Mengele. And I said, no kidding. It must be, uh, you know,
[1:53:02.240 --> 1:53:08.960]  just the same name. Actually, the Mengele family, uh, the infamous Dr. Mengele was from a very good
[1:53:08.960 --> 1:53:15.600]  family. And during the war, he was in charge of, as you know, he was very reputable doctor,
[1:53:15.600 --> 1:53:22.880]  just like Dr. Ewan Cameron at the Allen Memorial Hospital in Montreal. And, um, Dr. Mengele,
[1:53:22.880 --> 1:53:28.320]  uh, little Mengele, uh, I call him Fauci little Mengele, a little Mengele is actually the worst
[1:53:28.320 --> 1:53:34.960]  of all. Okay. Because if you look at Dr. Mengele, Dr. Mengele was a soldier in a sense in a war
[1:53:34.960 --> 1:53:40.080]  that was being fought. Pilots were being shot down. They were freezing. They were doing horrible
[1:53:40.080 --> 1:53:45.440]  experiments on, on prisoners to get information and data in the hope that they would be able to
[1:53:45.440 --> 1:53:50.640]  save the lives of their soldiers or whatever under the war circumstance. Sure. And for those that
[1:53:50.640 --> 1:53:55.600]  don't know Mengele was actually part of the German aristocracy, part of a royal house. And he is the
[1:53:55.600 --> 1:54:00.800]  famous angel of death, a secret experimentation doctor. Correct. But he was, he was forced to
[1:54:00.800 --> 1:54:04.320]  do it. Someone else would have done it or he would have been taken to the side and shot or
[1:54:04.320 --> 1:54:09.040]  something for not following the orders. I mean, this is war time. I'm not saying, I'm not excusing
[1:54:09.040 --> 1:54:13.520]  it. He's a monster. Okay. No, you're right. I mean, I agree. Fauci is worse because he gleefully
[1:54:13.520 --> 1:54:19.360]  is doing it. You got it. Okay. He, this man was associated with AIDS. This guy was associated
[1:54:19.360 --> 1:54:25.520]  with immune suppressive technologies. This man was involved intimately with George Soros,
[1:54:25.520 --> 1:54:31.280]  okay, whom right now from what I see from pictures, the ADL is sending its Nosferatu out there,
[1:54:31.280 --> 1:54:37.120]  you know, Greenblatt to, to protect this guy's professional character. There's none of that.
[1:54:37.120 --> 1:54:45.040]  The next thing is this, Alex. The Allen Memorial Hospital was actually Dr. Ewing Cameron was a
[1:54:45.040 --> 1:54:51.440]  very famous, very well-recommended psychiatrist. It was recommended to the Allen Memorial Hospital
[1:54:51.440 --> 1:54:55.840]  by Dr. Wilder Penfield, where I was at the Montreal Neurological Institute later on,
[1:54:55.840 --> 1:55:02.960]  and 14 years later. And some of the teachers did experiments at the time on sensory deprivation
[1:55:02.960 --> 1:55:08.080]  to find out what are the effects of sensory deprivation on human performance, okay, sleep
[1:55:08.080 --> 1:55:14.560]  deprivation, and so on. The ideas were formulated in Dr. Ewing Cameron because the bad science
[1:55:14.560 --> 1:55:19.280]  was that people thought that the brain was like a computer that could just, you could de-program
[1:55:19.280 --> 1:55:26.240]  and then reboot and re-program again, okay, with a new software. Well, it didn't work out that way.
[1:55:26.240 --> 1:55:32.800]  Dr. Ewing Cameron, in fact, was operating on 53 people, one of which was the father of Harvey
[1:55:32.800 --> 1:55:37.920]  Weinstein, believe it or not, in Montreal. No, no, that's right. Well, actually, he had thousands
[1:55:37.920 --> 1:55:42.720]  of patients total in mind control experiments. That's Dr. Ewing Cameron who helped run MKUltra.
[1:55:42.720 --> 1:55:50.400]  That's right. The MKUltra program, in fact, was based on a military, again, necessity,
[1:55:50.400 --> 1:55:54.480]  which was that the Korean War had, you know, people were coming back from the Korean War and
[1:55:54.480 --> 1:55:58.000]  they were sort of like against the United States. And they said, well, what are they going? How
[1:55:58.000 --> 1:56:02.720]  they can convince these people to be against the United States? Like, you know, these Stockholm
[1:56:02.720 --> 1:56:07.600]  syndrome. But at that time, there was a theory that the brain was like a computer and that you
[1:56:07.600 --> 1:56:12.960]  could actually, you know, alter it by the programming and then what they call psychic driving. Okay.
[1:56:12.960 --> 1:56:15.680]  Well, yeah, stay there. We'll come back and let you do five more minutes because you're a smart
[1:56:15.680 --> 1:56:21.520]  guy, Carlos, but we all know that the CIA and the OSS before that had a bunch of mind control.
[1:56:21.520 --> 1:56:25.920]  They used the excuse of what North Korea was doing and the Chinese were doing in the Manchurian
[1:56:25.920 --> 1:56:31.680]  candidate project to go, oh, we've got to look at this to stop it. Oh, the Chinese invented it,
[1:56:31.680 --> 1:56:37.440]  which is absolutely ridiculous. All these major governments and systems have been practicing
[1:56:37.440 --> 1:56:42.560]  mind control for a long, long time. Carlos in Montreal, Canada is our guest. Then Sid,
[1:56:43.360 --> 1:56:50.960]  Kano, a lot of wild names today, and Corey and Kai and Jesus is Lord short and long. You know,
[1:56:50.960 --> 1:56:59.120]  what's up today with the calls? I've had more crazy named people today than like 20 years combined.
[1:57:00.240 --> 1:57:05.200]  Very strange. So we're going to see what's going on here today. But we're going to break that all
[1:57:05.200 --> 1:57:11.920]  down. Reset Wars, by the way, is now live resetwars.com. And it's a six plus hour course on how

[1:59:48.320 --> 2:00:04.080]  All right Carlos in Montreal Canada
[2:00:06.080 --> 2:00:08.880]  or Quebec Canada or somewhere in Canada somewhere in North America
[2:00:09.440 --> 2:00:15.440]  is joining us. He was getting into bad science and their monsters Fauci and Mengele. You were
[2:00:15.440 --> 2:00:22.720]  getting into Dr. Ewing Cameron and admitted declassified sections of MKUltra. Alex, that's
[2:00:22.720 --> 2:00:30.560]  correct Alex. The the Allem Memorial Psychiatric Teaching Hospital was at the time trying to
[2:00:30.560 --> 2:00:36.640]  develop a cure for these schizophrenia. People are really suffered terribly whose life was being
[2:00:36.640 --> 2:00:43.360]  impacted. At the Montreal Neurological Institute in the 1930s 40s 50s Dr. Wilder Penfield had
[2:00:43.360 --> 2:00:48.400]  developed technologies called a Montreal procedure for treating again very radically
[2:00:48.400 --> 2:00:53.920]  by removal part of the the brain that was responsible for epilepsy and so the Allem
[2:00:53.920 --> 2:01:01.680]  Memorial Psychiatric Hospital undertook this project financed by a top secret program called
[2:01:01.680 --> 2:01:10.320]  MKUltra. It was sub project 68 and there's no reason to believe that the Allem Memorial Hospital
[2:01:10.320 --> 2:01:18.000]  people and Dr. Ewing knew the secret financing was was transferred through a company through a
[2:01:18.000 --> 2:01:23.440]  trust okay and so he didn't he might not have known I don't know he might not have known that
[2:01:23.440 --> 2:01:29.360]  there's a CIA project but I know that suddenly in 63 he just quit and he left in everything and he
[2:01:29.360 --> 2:01:34.160]  didn't want to hear about it. I probably somebody whispered in his ear what I'm not trying to justify
[2:01:34.160 --> 2:01:39.840]  anything what I'm trying to tell you is that the the experiments were not necessarily a success
[2:01:39.840 --> 2:01:46.080]  because they were trying to cure but the electric shock sometimes they were doing like 78% higher
[2:01:46.080 --> 2:01:52.000]  than normal which was really awful okay these were not experiments to be proud of but they were
[2:01:52.000 --> 2:01:57.760]  trying to affect the model of the brain as the computer. The brain is not a computer Alex let
[2:01:57.760 --> 2:02:03.440]  me tell you sincerely it is an analog computer at best because but as a calculator it's terrible
[2:02:03.440 --> 2:02:08.480]  if you try to multiply fractions by fractions you will you will just fail it's not a very good
[2:02:08.480 --> 2:02:14.720]  computer as airplane accidents show many times the pilot control so what I want to tell you just
[2:02:14.720 --> 2:02:22.400]  basically is that bad science creates bad doctors it creates monsters and we now I want to take this
[2:02:22.400 --> 2:02:32.800]  as a future okay there was two major grants given 1.3 billion dollars 1 1 billion euros to a project
[2:02:32.800 --> 2:02:41.760]  to a scientist who was trying to model with computers the human brain okay again again
[2:02:41.760 --> 2:02:49.280]  bad modeling if you search for the name Henry Markram you will see that this scientist who did
[2:02:49.280 --> 2:02:54.880]  some work on you know stimulating neurons and getting them to fire he came to the idea that
[2:02:54.880 --> 2:03:00.160]  you could actually create a computer model a working model a holographic type representational
[2:03:00.160 --> 2:03:05.520]  model of the human brain and how it's the mind and so on well it doesn't work like that okay
[2:03:05.520 --> 2:03:10.880]  it's not a computer there's a very big difference and we'll discuss it another time between what
[2:03:10.880 --> 2:03:16.720]  is the mind and the soul okay the soul and the mind are two actually distinct things but
[2:03:16.720 --> 2:03:21.440]  let's leave it there for now what I wanted to just draw your attention to is that what I call little
[2:03:21.440 --> 2:03:31.040]  Mengele Fauci has been doing with this technology with this idea that you can have mRNA vaccines
[2:03:31.040 --> 2:03:38.560]  and so on he's tainted by his associations with George Soros with Wuxi in Wuhan which is by the
[2:03:38.560 --> 2:03:46.000]  way in the same area doing the kind of research with the the drugs that were being manufactured
[2:03:46.000 --> 2:03:52.240]  by Gilead Sciences you know so this will all come out this will all come out but in the meantime
[2:03:52.240 --> 2:04:00.000]  what all of these experimentation with mRNA have shown and will show that in the final analysis
[2:04:00.000 --> 2:04:06.800]  world governance of the say a vaccine or a pandemic can be very destructive whether it's innocent
[2:04:06.800 --> 2:04:14.080]  or not can you imagine if the if the if the if a little my drug that was a cosmetic drug given
[2:04:14.080 --> 2:04:20.640]  to women so that they wouldn't have you know morning sickness was given worldwide in one shot
[2:04:20.640 --> 2:04:25.600]  and then three four five six nine months later all these children were born without legs and arms
[2:04:25.600 --> 2:04:30.720]  and and deformed because of the drug can you imagine enforcing these people until they start
[2:04:30.720 --> 2:04:37.600]  getting those horrible results no world government does not work absolutely it's an out of control
[2:04:37.600 --> 2:04:43.680]  medical tyranny it's by design and it is genocide being rolled out the collapse of civilization
[2:04:43.680 --> 2:04:49.280]  the shots cause a collapse from fear and hysteria and lockdowns and death that leads the bigger
[2:04:49.280 --> 2:04:54.320]  collapse that causes the mega death thank you so much carlos amazing points we'll be back with more
[2:04:54.320 --> 2:05:03.200]  callers everything i do we have developed the research and the tools to stop this evil and
[2:05:03.200 --> 2:05:07.840]  to break free from it and to help others break free from it that's why we've launched reset wars
[2:05:08.560 --> 2:05:12.560]  once you simply accept that there is an incredibly evil group of people in the world
[2:05:12.560 --> 2:05:17.920]  that are attempting the great reset and want a one world corporate government then you can learn
[2:05:17.920 --> 2:05:24.400]  how to defeat them by learning their war game strategies and how to not play the game after
[2:05:24.400 --> 2:05:31.680]  decades of intense research our quest to discover the key to breaking the globalist bonds is now

[2:14:09.040 --> 2:14:13.680]  but in the end all they want you to do is reimagine logic so anytime something doesn't make
[2:14:13.680 --> 2:14:20.320]  sense they want you to reimagine logic well that's right like oh reimagine no no you don't

[2:20:48.640 --> 2:20:54.000]  which is hard to do covenland.com to find the film i am a limited producer involved helping
[2:20:54.000 --> 2:20:59.360]  get it done and voiced it it's exclusively available on dvd and infowarstore.com he had a caller last
[2:20:59.360 --> 2:21:04.800]  hour ago why are you selling stuff how do they pay for interviewing more than 50 people and flying
[2:21:04.800 --> 2:21:09.600]  people all over the country on on films and editing and putting together and producing dvds and selling
[2:21:09.600 --> 2:21:14.400]  it this is not about making money we want to make money we go join the globalist and i'm not
[2:21:14.400 --> 2:21:19.120]  addressing that caller as much as other people realizing who else is going to fight the globalist

[2:21:42.640 --> 2:21:47.280]  it's gonna be a five part series a historical documentation of the takeover it ends with
[2:21:47.280 --> 2:21:51.680]  the great reset takeover that's going to be currently produced as it happens but this is
[2:21:51.680 --> 2:21:56.000]  the history of it and very important about the mask is a fraud and you notice we say in the film
[2:21:56.560 --> 2:22:00.080]  the mask is going to be forever and now they're admitting the mask is forever get a copy of it

[2:22:09.600 --> 2:22:14.720]  people running this whole show so liberty man is the tech entrepreneur that loves liberty and hates
[2:22:14.720 --> 2:22:21.280]  the new world order and he helped get zero money back for himself pay millions of dollars to produce
[2:22:21.280 --> 2:22:27.040]  it now we're selling it so info wars gets funded and the director and the film crew gets paid so
[2:22:27.040 --> 2:22:31.360]  that's the inside baseball who cares that doesn't matter the point is it's powerful the enemy doesn't
[2:22:31.360 --> 2:22:36.880]  want it to be seen and you can get the dvd down at infowarstore.com and soon we'll post part two
[2:22:36.880 --> 2:22:42.640]  the last video got like five million views on news wars and on a band-aid video but again you as an
[2:22:42.640 --> 2:22:47.040]  audience already know all this stuff it's about reaching other people than getting them to reach
[2:22:47.040 --> 2:22:52.720]  others that causes the chain reaction so let's go to paul wittenberger here with liberty man
[2:22:52.720 --> 2:22:58.720]  paul wittenberger i mean man we are watching this happen in live time i just hope that we defeat them
[2:22:58.720 --> 2:23:02.880]  so part five comes out next year because they're about to hit the internet kill switch brother
[2:23:02.880 --> 2:23:08.880]  that's why dvds are so important with internet kill switch having a hardcore record a digital book
[2:23:08.880 --> 2:23:15.680]  is what this is is going to be so critical right yeah and that's why i'm so glad that this
[2:23:16.560 --> 2:23:22.080]  was seen by five million people the first episode i mean really almost six million people if you
[2:23:22.080 --> 2:23:28.960]  include all the other uploads of this film so episode one was a huge success episode two though

[2:23:44.080 --> 2:23:49.200]  them out of there people ask why are you selling a dvd if it's going to be on on band-aid video
[2:23:49.200 --> 2:23:53.200]  because you're the people planting the seeds you're the ones that want to pay so that other
[2:23:53.200 --> 2:23:59.200]  people get saved it takes people committing to win a war so so exactly have a dvd have the original
[2:23:59.200 --> 2:24:03.360]  soon part two is going to be posted to band-aid video i hope it gets like you said five million

[2:24:07.360 --> 2:24:14.400]  success in of itself please continue well i i've been working on this since december of last year
[2:24:14.400 --> 2:24:21.200]  so i mean if we didn't make any money i mean there's no way i could spend you know 16 hours a day
[2:24:21.200 --> 2:24:25.520]  working to get these episodes done yeah i don't want to upset the caller last hour it's just so
[2:24:25.520 --> 2:24:29.680]  evil to say that we're fighting evil we're being shut down we're under attack and we shouldn't be
[2:24:29.680 --> 2:24:34.000]  selling something it's a satanic phone call let's just move on from that but but tell us what's in
[2:24:34.000 --> 2:24:37.920]  the mass i've watched it the other film is very powerful because it shows a bunch of history
[2:24:37.920 --> 2:24:43.120]  they want us to forget murdering folks in hospitals all of its very powerful but this one is so
[2:24:43.120 --> 2:24:48.400]  pertinent now because it's like a message to people of activism of here's how the mass is a scam
[2:24:48.400 --> 2:24:55.680]  give us your city council your school board your college i mean this is powerful right well the
[2:24:55.680 --> 2:25:02.640]  mass is not only 100 useless but it's dangerous as well so i think that this film does a really great
[2:25:02.640 --> 2:25:09.120]  job at just talking to the average person and explaining them why it's dangerous why it's
[2:25:09.120 --> 2:25:17.360]  useless and why they're using this tool to propagate this whole lockdown this whole debacle
[2:25:18.000 --> 2:25:22.400]  of covid and we've got a bunch of these clips here talking about that and showing the science
[2:25:22.400 --> 2:25:27.200]  liberty man you know we started out now eight eight eight months ago in these productions i mean
[2:25:27.200 --> 2:25:32.640]  before shooting it but how fast what's it like to be in the middle of this and watching it happen in
[2:25:32.640 --> 2:25:40.480]  real time it's uh it's quite something you know i remember when fall and i were uh collaborating
[2:25:40.480 --> 2:25:46.400]  on the mask episode we figured oh no we need to get this out now uh the mask thing might not be such
[2:25:46.400 --> 2:25:51.840]  an issue and we talked about it and i said you know i don't know i have my hunches that they're
[2:25:51.840 --> 2:25:57.680]  going to make the mask a permanent fixture uh the reason is because it's an edward bernet's level
[2:25:57.680 --> 2:26:04.640]  propaganda gimmick is really what it is it's this symbolism uh g edward griffin is in the episode
[2:26:04.640 --> 2:26:11.120]  and i think he elegantly says that it's a it's an outward uh visual for everybody to see that there's
[2:26:11.120 --> 2:26:17.280]  this consensus everybody agrees that um well if i have a mask on that this whole thing must be real
[2:26:17.280 --> 2:26:22.560]  i believe it's real and if everyone around me's dotted on well group thing kicks in and i'm
[2:26:22.560 --> 2:26:27.760]  i'm really convinced alex that you know we have a lot of fronts in this war but uh if we want to
[2:26:28.800 --> 2:26:34.880]  start to gain some ground on this whole medical tyranny ditching the mask is huge because it's
[2:26:35.520 --> 2:26:41.200]  if we can go out and about and carry you know go on out go to the gym or go to restaurants or
[2:26:41.200 --> 2:26:47.680]  what have you and not have this foolish uh soil face diaper hanging over our our mouth and nose
[2:26:48.480 --> 2:26:52.480]  everybody's looking at each other and seeing things are normal and it'll click in their mind
[2:26:52.480 --> 2:26:57.600]  things are normal right but when everyone's all masked up where it's this constant perpetuation
[2:26:57.600 --> 2:27:03.360]  of oh there's a pandemic there's a health crisis and let's be honest right this is uh this is just
[2:27:03.360 --> 2:27:08.640]  a propaganda stunt really beautifully said it's the symbol of the permanent emergency it's the
[2:27:08.640 --> 2:27:13.440]  symbol of believing within the fraud it's the symbol that you're dirty and evil and taking it off as
[2:27:13.440 --> 2:27:18.720]  a revolutionary act and i would say as negative as things are as bad as things are the globalists
[2:27:18.720 --> 2:27:23.040]  admit their own internal documents that have leaked it's not going well for them they thought we would
[2:27:23.040 --> 2:27:29.760]  submit a lot more so we're definitely in the fight right now yes we are and i think it's
[2:27:29.760 --> 2:27:36.720]  going to take little tiny acts of resistance for us to start gaining some major ground and really
[2:27:36.720 --> 2:27:43.280]  uh have the momentum shift our way the mask is one where i think you know obviously your audience is
[2:27:43.280 --> 2:27:48.560]  is pretty based and they're going to already be aware of the foolishness of the face diaper
[2:27:48.560 --> 2:27:54.080]  that's great but let's be honest um there are we all are dealing with this face mask because it
[2:27:54.080 --> 2:27:59.040]  could be our favorite store our favorite gym or wherever that we like to go somebody's in control
[2:27:59.040 --> 2:28:05.040]  of a mask policy and they're pushing it on to people so with this episode what i'm really hoping
[2:28:05.040 --> 2:28:08.800]  is that we could make this the activist episode this is the one where it's like you want to get a
[2:28:08.800 --> 2:28:13.680]  handful of dps and you want to strategically put this in the hands of people that are in control
[2:28:13.680 --> 2:28:19.040]  of mask policies maybe it's your boss at work maybe it's somebody that you know uh is the general
[2:28:19.040 --> 2:28:24.240]  manager or store manager at some some place that you like to to be a patron of we want to target
[2:28:24.240 --> 2:28:29.760]  and get this into people because this whole episode is designed to make people uh to appeal to a wide
[2:28:29.760 --> 2:28:34.640]  general audience give them a lot of scientific data about the reality how the mask doesn't help
[2:28:34.640 --> 2:28:40.240]  you it hurts you um but also for them to see what it's doing to kids and at the end of it for them
[2:28:40.240 --> 2:28:44.800]  to just be like there's just no way i'd ever put one of these on in fact that's why i wanted to get
[2:28:44.800 --> 2:28:49.520]  you guys on a few weeks ago when you told me this in a phone call come back and recap that because
[2:28:49.520 --> 2:28:53.920]  i want to put that up front in a video release you're right this is the activist dvd and if people

[2:31:15.520 --> 2:31:19.280]  the little farmers that you know the media calls communist but really they're just a commune and
[2:31:19.280 --> 2:31:23.200]  whatever the point is is that it's good coffee and we've got it and the farmers don't let the
[2:31:23.200 --> 2:31:26.560]  mexican government take over so i actually buy this from the mexican rebels and i've been buying

[2:32:26.960 --> 2:32:31.920]  the samoan people would drink kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to

[2:33:24.320 --> 2:33:40.320]  well right now as we speak joe biden the puppet president is giving somebody the congressional
[2:33:40.320 --> 2:33:45.280]  medal of honor and they're all wearing masks oh we're in a permanent emergency oh we're in the
[2:33:45.280 --> 2:33:50.160]  cult remember a few years ago wired magazine had the article he who must not be named it was my
[2:33:50.160 --> 2:33:56.240]  face covered up by a black veil being sucked into the darkness the red white and blue the
[2:33:56.240 --> 2:34:01.680]  archetypal image is america is being silenced you're being taken to the darkness they're telling you
[2:34:01.680 --> 2:34:07.760]  as a sick joke what's actually happening liberty man who is the money man a tech entrepreneur
[2:34:08.320 --> 2:34:11.760]  that's helped produce the five part series that's in production right now part two
[2:34:12.560 --> 2:34:18.240]  of covet land the mask which is the activist issue he told me about this a few weeks ago on
[2:34:18.240 --> 2:34:22.480]  the phone i said you've got to come on this is genius you're absolutely right just like some
[2:34:22.480 --> 2:34:26.640]  of my previous films that i helped direct and produce you guys have wrecked and produced this
[2:34:26.640 --> 2:34:32.400]  have been game changers recap what you were saying liberty man about this being the activist film
[2:34:32.400 --> 2:34:38.560]  dvd underground folks still have dvd players they can be told is forbidden information you'll see
[2:34:38.560 --> 2:34:43.600]  this the mask are permanent uh organ now made it permanent they're announcing it's permanent in
[2:34:43.600 --> 2:34:48.480]  europe i mean it's happening now covet land the mask is such an incredible tool for people to
[2:34:48.480 --> 2:34:53.440]  take action whether it's really up to them how much action do they take with this to actually do
[2:34:53.440 --> 2:35:00.720]  something yeah it's it's uh it's quite something you know i i think uh if you think about the
[2:35:00.720 --> 2:35:06.320]  context we're in right there's a lot of mindless compliance going on and uh i'm in a country where
[2:35:06.320 --> 2:35:11.360]  there isn't a mask mandate and yet i'd say 70 80 percent of people are out about with masks and
[2:35:11.360 --> 2:35:18.640]  we're talking like outside 30 degree weather doing yard work um riding on motorcycles with no
[2:35:18.640 --> 2:35:23.680]  elements down the highway but they got a face diaper on you know this kind of just complete nonsense
[2:35:23.680 --> 2:35:29.200]  um but what i found is if you can talk to people most people if you talk to them and just give them
[2:35:29.200 --> 2:35:35.280]  a little bit of information and they see you not wearing a stupid face mask it's contagious they
[2:35:35.280 --> 2:35:40.560]  start to feel like an idiot for wearing one and especially if you get the real reasons to not
[2:35:40.560 --> 2:35:45.680]  wear one um yeah you can you can win the over on this issue you can unlock them on
[2:35:46.480 --> 2:35:52.160]  i mean on the simple you know simple issue of just a face mask so the activist episode
[2:35:52.160 --> 2:35:59.760]  at this episode two is one where we can have a huge influence and i think we can start to tear down
[2:36:00.320 --> 2:36:05.040]  this consensus perception that we're in a health crisis
[2:36:05.040 --> 2:36:11.760]  talk about that because if people get the dvd we want to make copies it doesn't have
[2:36:11.760 --> 2:36:15.760]  copyright protection if they hand out say hey here's the forbidden information the mask is a
[2:36:15.760 --> 2:36:22.080]  fraud it's a symbol of slavery it's like the nazi armband i mean this could really explode
[2:36:22.080 --> 2:36:25.680]  if this audience of millions gets the dvd and then shares it
[2:36:27.760 --> 2:36:33.840]  yeah i agree and the key thing too is the kids right in the episode we show how that has a
[2:36:33.840 --> 2:36:40.080]  psychological effect on children and if you think about now we're two years almost into this
[2:36:40.080 --> 2:36:45.440]  and about a year and a half where you know the face poopy the face mask has been a thing well
[2:36:45.440 --> 2:36:49.200]  kids are now you know you can look at some kids that are four or five years old i know alex you
[2:36:49.200 --> 2:36:54.080]  have a young kid all you do i do as well and you're sitting there looking to like well 50 60
[2:36:54.080 --> 2:36:58.960]  percent of your life now you've spent seeing people in in face masks where you don't get to see their
[2:36:58.960 --> 2:37:07.200]  full face we're participating in the conditioning of the of a new generation this is totally dehumanization
[2:37:07.200 --> 2:37:12.000]  this is preparing us to not see ourselves as human or individuals let's play a few clips
[2:37:12.000 --> 2:37:17.040]  and then get the director's take on it here's clip one sherry tenpenny and jay we're riffing on
[2:37:17.040 --> 2:37:24.800]  mask and forming the clip to daniel mccarthy play both of us it just blew my mind how quickly
[2:37:24.800 --> 2:37:31.280]  and how readily the entire world just rolled over and put on a mask
[2:37:35.200 --> 2:37:42.480]  i see the mask as a symbol of of conformity to the lie a symbol that everybody everybody
[2:37:42.480 --> 2:37:46.880]  agrees with the lie otherwise they wouldn't be wearing the mask and if everybody agrees that
[2:37:46.880 --> 2:37:52.080]  it must be true if it's consensus well guess so that's we've been trained to think that if
[2:37:52.080 --> 2:37:58.080]  if you've got the majority or a huge majority believing something it must be true when in fact
[2:37:58.080 --> 2:38:04.240]  it's usually just the opposite i've never worn a mask i i will not wear a mask there's there you
[2:38:04.240 --> 2:38:08.400]  couldn't pay me a billion dollars to wear a mask and here's why i know as soon as i put that mask
[2:38:08.400 --> 2:38:13.120]  on a little piece of me is gonna die now not everybody can do what i do you know some people
[2:38:13.120 --> 2:38:17.120]  have to do it because their work's telling them to do that or some people think that i have to fly
[2:38:17.120 --> 2:38:22.480]  on this airplane or i have to ride in this uber or i have to go to this restaurant and that's why
[2:38:22.480 --> 2:38:32.080]  we have the mask is because not enough people said no this movie needs to be seen it needs to be
[2:38:32.080 --> 2:38:36.800]  copied needs to be aired you need to have local showings you need to get it out and that's why
[2:38:36.800 --> 2:38:41.600]  we made it so you could have it and get it out covet land to the mask and then fold store.com
[2:38:41.600 --> 2:38:49.120]  and you get the free bohemian grow films with it going to the director from framing the world.com
[2:38:49.120 --> 2:38:55.440]  paul wittenberger paul i mean this everything we warned about years ago is now happening
[2:38:56.560 --> 2:39:02.720]  this is literally like antibiotics when your child's dying of an of a bacterial infection i mean
[2:39:02.720 --> 2:39:10.720]  this film's got to get out to people right and what you saw there was just a few people that we
[2:39:10.720 --> 2:39:16.880]  interviewed in this episode we had we interviewed 18 different people that eight of those people
[2:39:16.880 --> 2:39:24.240]  were not in episode one so uh a lot of of great uh interviews we had tammy clark who you just had
[2:39:24.240 --> 2:39:30.800]  on the show the other day we have dr erik niputi uh dwayne soval and by the way the job you did i
[2:39:30.800 --> 2:39:38.720]  mean i wish it just so it looks like hbo such a quality production well i appreciate that you know
[2:39:38.720 --> 2:39:44.560]  i i i did try to spend a lot of time and making sure you know the lighting was good the sound was
[2:39:44.560 --> 2:39:51.600]  good and that's what i really focus on because the sound is so important in a production and so
[2:39:51.600 --> 2:39:57.520]  yeah i did try to as best as i could to make it sound and look good well what do you want to
[2:39:57.520 --> 2:40:02.320]  see come out of this because i mean we can see that germany and austria have announced they're
[2:40:02.320 --> 2:40:06.240]  going to start arresting people in mass force inoculation start in a month and a half austria
[2:40:06.240 --> 2:40:11.840]  to begin shipping unvaxxed to prisons one year in prison i mean this is the this is it it's it's
[2:40:11.840 --> 2:40:20.480]  not a joke it's a real fraud right and you know if people really understood the the power of of
[2:40:20.480 --> 2:40:26.400]  this episode you know they would go out and get it and get multiple copies because we need to get
[2:40:26.400 --> 2:40:33.360]  these out to as many people as we possibly can we need to share this with everyone and so especially
[2:40:33.360 --> 2:40:39.760]  when it comes out free online on bandah video you know we really need your audience to send it out
[2:40:39.760 --> 2:40:46.320]  to as many people as they can because this does have the power to change people's hearts and change
[2:40:46.320 --> 2:40:52.560]  people's minds and that's what we want to do covet land to the mask is bolt cutters to cut the chains
[2:40:52.560 --> 2:41:00.000]  off liberty man what do you want to say about this well alex i uh i i just pardon me just can't
[2:41:00.000 --> 2:41:07.200]  believe you that uh so many people fall into compliance but it the realization is that
[2:41:08.720 --> 2:41:14.960]  we have uh like you say there's reset wars and i was thinking about it last night you know you
[2:41:14.960 --> 2:41:20.800]  could look at uh 1776 as being a great reset you could look at magna card as being a great reset
[2:41:20.800 --> 2:41:25.840]  they're trying to have their great reset and so it really is reset what kind of reset are we going to
[2:41:25.840 --> 2:41:36.320]  have i totally agree the magna card was a reset in 1215 1776 was a reset they're trying to have
[2:41:36.320 --> 2:41:40.960]  their big reset against us right now this is the corrupt globalist offensive
[2:41:43.520 --> 2:41:48.960]  that's right so when i think about this mask episode i kind of see us you know we partnered
[2:41:48.960 --> 2:41:55.680]  on this documentary series i kind of think about us as being a little bit of a special forces unit
[2:41:55.680 --> 2:42:00.400]  in your arsenal you know you're the big general and you've got a lot of fronts that you're fighting
[2:42:00.400 --> 2:42:06.480]  on and then we come in and we help augment what you're doing and um and so this is a special
[2:42:06.480 --> 2:42:12.240]  forces uh strike this episode too you know this is this is the activist episode and i do think
[2:42:12.240 --> 2:42:20.080]  that the mask is a key pillar in their entire um covid campaign i mean i i mean i think it's the
[2:42:20.080 --> 2:42:24.480]  central pillar it's it's their symbol it's who they are and i agree with you if the listeners
[2:42:24.480 --> 2:42:28.880]  got excited and if they got the dvd and made copies and reuploaded it and had showings the
[2:42:28.880 --> 2:42:35.040]  library and everywhere it would totally cause a chain reaction so it's the catalyst it's the sword
[2:42:35.040 --> 2:42:39.760]  and the stone waiting for somebody to pull it we've got to stand up these virtue signalers
[2:42:39.760 --> 2:42:45.440]  and they're and the people under stockum syndrome get cobin land to the mass part two at info
[2:42:45.440 --> 2:42:50.640]  or store dot com get it make copies have public showings and more we'll be right back on a bunch
[2:42:50.640 --> 2:42:59.440]  of clips from the film we're about to premiere stay with us so this could be everything i do
[2:42:59.440 --> 2:43:04.880]  is about victory for humanity everything i promote is about standing up against the new
[2:43:04.880 --> 2:43:10.240]  world order by empowering humanity well that's why reset wars dot com is so important not only is it
[2:43:10.240 --> 2:43:16.320]  a game changing course of critical information to unlock your mind from the matrix but it's
[2:43:16.320 --> 2:43:23.760]  something that gets around plow Schwab's attempt to shut down american infrastructure and american
[2:43:23.760 --> 2:43:30.800]  jobs it is the true digital economy it's the spiritual economy of the mind and transcendent
[2:43:30.800 --> 2:43:37.680]  or control i've been on there 28 years and all of our work has been amazing thanks to god and
[2:43:37.680 --> 2:43:42.880]  god's divine empowerment and blessing but i gotta tell you out of everything i've done reset wars
[2:43:42.880 --> 2:43:50.000]  is the most important and it is now available now the month of december 2021 is here at reset wars
[2:43:50.000 --> 2:43:56.560]  dot com start your journey to the next level today at reset wars dot com the globalist fear
[2:43:56.560 --> 2:44:02.480]  this information so when i first started taking survival shield basically i was 275 pounds i was
[2:44:02.480 --> 2:44:07.920]  overweight i had brain fog like you wouldn't believe i was barely holding on to a job and i heard
[2:44:07.920 --> 2:44:12.160]  dr group on your show and i listened to it so the first one i got was the original survival
[2:44:12.160 --> 2:44:16.720]  shield the x1 and it worked pretty good and then shortly thereafter you came out with that you
[2:44:16.720 --> 2:44:20.400]  had you know with a deep burden source you know and i got really excited about that so i took it
[2:44:20.400 --> 2:44:26.880]  and man in two weeks i went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened you
[2:44:26.880 --> 2:44:32.240]  know i could think again i could connect with people again and over the course of the next couple
[2:44:32.240 --> 2:44:36.800]  of years i got my health back and i religiously take basically all of your supplements they're
[2:44:36.800 --> 2:44:41.760]  all absolutely amazing supplements the one i like recently is knockout literally like if you
[2:44:41.760 --> 2:44:46.480]  want to sleep just take it it's amazing it works but anyway so the point is we have to get ourselves
[2:44:46.480 --> 2:44:51.440]  clean that's a break free of the globalist system and the only way to do that is to take our own
[2:44:51.440 --> 2:44:56.160]  help into our own hand beautifully said brother i thank you so much for your call and godspeed
[2:44:57.920 --> 2:45:04.240]  i am a worldly person meaning i like going to ball games i like going to concerts i like going
[2:45:04.240 --> 2:45:09.760]  to play golf i like going out to dinner i like the metropolitan life i like everything that
[2:45:09.760 --> 2:45:16.240]  comes with this but see i have the survival instinct that is to get the hell out of democrat
[2:45:16.240 --> 2:45:21.680]  run cities get the hell out of major metropolitan areas because unless we change course soon it's
[2:45:21.680 --> 2:45:26.480]  all crashing down is it time to just move out to the woods just time to go get a piece of property
[2:45:26.480 --> 2:45:30.560]  in the woods just get off grid just get the emergency food supplies just live off the land
[2:45:30.560 --> 2:45:34.800]  that's the survival instinct but see the worldly part of me that's still probably the majority
[2:45:34.800 --> 2:45:40.000]  part of me says no no no no stay in the city the survival instinct says get the hell out of
[2:45:40.000 --> 2:45:44.320]  anywhere they've ever notion that you need to get a vaccine or a mask that's the that's the internal
[2:45:44.320 --> 2:45:50.480]  struggle that my guess is a lot of you in the audience are facing as well but you can at least
[2:45:50.480 --> 2:45:55.200]  have some comfort if you have the emergency food supplies and so we have the best ones at info
[2:45:55.200 --> 2:46:02.320]  or store dot com let's go ahead take another call let's talk to malcolm in tennessee welcome hello
[2:46:02.320 --> 2:46:06.960]  alex yes malcolm all right i will make this quick and real short where the other patreons can get
[2:46:06.960 --> 2:46:12.480]  on the line uh alex i have to promote one thing from one of your co-host owin schreuer super
[2:46:12.480 --> 2:46:18.240]  male volatility and brain force plus mix those two together you're an unstoppable tank super
[2:46:18.240 --> 2:46:23.440]  male volatility really really works it's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have
[2:46:23.440 --> 2:46:29.680]  never been heated up and so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions they also
[2:46:29.680 --> 2:46:34.480]  work quite well but just aren't as strong this is like a very fine wine it's it's it's in fact
[2:46:34.480 --> 2:46:38.320]  each batch is different sometimes it's super strong sometimes it's just okay people like
[2:46:38.320 --> 2:46:41.600]  why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch is in a strong that's just
[2:46:41.600 --> 2:46:47.680]  how it is it's how it works uh so it's always good it's just sometimes it's like super strong but
[2:46:47.680 --> 2:47:01.200]  yeah if you want the rolls royce at a decent price then this is it leading a frontal assault on the
[2:47:01.200 --> 2:47:20.960]  lies of the new world order it's alex jones all right i'm gonna do a little bit the next hour
[2:47:20.960 --> 2:47:26.000]  the juror salante is going to be taking over i meant to play this earlier as a as a symbol of
[2:47:26.000 --> 2:47:31.040]  how we defeat them because yeah this guy jumping on national australian tv is not that spectacular
[2:47:31.040 --> 2:47:36.080]  but he gets the message out and then if others do this like we did five years ago during the 2016
[2:47:36.080 --> 2:47:43.120]  election it's going to bring the globalist down man video bombs covid newscast stop lying to the
[2:47:43.120 --> 2:47:48.320]  world from australia here it is among the other things i'll be discussing no doubt is this massive
[2:47:48.320 --> 2:47:53.680]  outbreak that we've seen north of sydney in newcastle but it may have been a person from a
[2:47:53.680 --> 2:48:00.000]  nightclub a sydney boat party that has taken the variant to newcastle now if that is the case the
[2:48:00.000 --> 2:48:06.960]  person was in the brawl stop lying to the world stop lying to the world we're going to leave
[2:48:06.960 --> 2:48:12.400]  gabby there someone interfering with her cross and we'll cross back to her a little uh later
[2:48:12.400 --> 2:48:19.200]  someone interfering in our mind control remember tucker carlson sitting there on fox news outside
[2:48:19.200 --> 2:48:23.920]  the guy jumps across hillary clinton's arabist put her in president info wars dot com and then it
[2:48:23.920 --> 2:48:31.200]  caused that whole chain reaction we are so close to a chain reaction of nonviolent peaceful
[2:48:31.200 --> 2:48:36.160]  information and that's where this film comes in will it's like it's like you're in a fight for
[2:48:36.160 --> 2:48:39.840]  your life you didn't start a fight you're going out at target at like ten o'clock at night you're
[2:48:39.840 --> 2:48:43.760]  loading your stuff some weird schizophrenic you know humble person starts a fight like hey i don't
[2:48:43.760 --> 2:48:48.640]  want to fight they swing they hit you in the side of the head like okay i gotta kick this person's
[2:48:48.640 --> 2:48:53.760]  ass you didn't ask for the fight but you're gonna put them down now and and it's the same thing
[2:48:53.760 --> 2:48:59.680]  i don't know if covet land too is going to be the punch that gets them not keeps them down
[2:48:59.680 --> 2:49:04.720]  i don't know if it's going to be reset wars that does it i don't know but i know this if i stop
[2:49:04.720 --> 2:49:09.840]  fighting i'm going to lose so everything i do is an attack everything i do is a punch back i didn't
[2:49:09.840 --> 2:49:14.160]  ask for the fight i didn't start the fight what are they they're going to attack us we're going to
[2:49:14.160 --> 2:49:20.080]  defend ourselves this is an information war so don't sit over there oh alex tells me i'm important
[2:49:20.080 --> 2:49:27.680]  to make me feel important no i need you to save me and my family seriously we've got to wake up
[2:49:27.680 --> 2:49:31.680]  together we're not going to beat this unless we wake up together this is our big quest this is
[2:49:31.680 --> 2:49:37.680]  our big time this is the biggest most scientific attack on humanity in recorded history in our
[2:49:37.680 --> 2:49:41.920]  entire history we know of it there may have been something worse like atlantis but the point is
[2:49:41.920 --> 2:49:46.160]  they're making their move on us right now and so i don't know if covet land too which is an amazing
[2:49:46.160 --> 2:49:51.120]  film so well produced uh that you know i'm punched drunk knowing the information i still watch it
[2:49:51.120 --> 2:49:56.560]  blows me away i don't know if this is going to save us but i know resistance is going to save us
[2:49:56.560 --> 2:50:01.920]  liberty man you want to comment on that and paul wittenberger yeah i think we're waiting
[2:50:02.480 --> 2:50:07.680]  still for the flashpoint right alex uh to see a turning of the tide they've kept us on our deals
[2:50:07.680 --> 2:50:16.400]  now for uh for a long time with this uh code stuff they almost two years we're about to enter year three
[2:50:16.400 --> 2:50:20.880]  that's right they've kept us on our heels in there just all over the propaganda the big difference
[2:50:20.880 --> 2:50:26.800]  this time of course is they've got the internet which you could think of as a giant um analytical
[2:50:26.800 --> 2:50:31.680]  tool right they've got all these sensors uh basically they can judge the effectiveness of
[2:50:31.680 --> 2:50:36.480]  their propaganda where it's working where it is and they've got a huge behavior sciences aspect
[2:50:36.480 --> 2:50:41.680]  to to everything that's going on so they've they've got the jump on us let's just be honest
[2:50:41.680 --> 2:50:47.920]  however i'm eternally optimistic and i do believe that um you know what even if all the odds are
[2:50:47.920 --> 2:50:52.880]  against us i'm still going to do the right thing and uh i'm going to i'm not i'm i'm going to go
[2:50:52.880 --> 2:50:57.280]  down fighting man i'm going to go down swinging and i'm comfortable with that and i think we just
[2:50:57.280 --> 2:51:02.000]  have to get to a spot where we stop clinging to these little uh little things in our life these
[2:51:02.000 --> 2:51:06.720]  little comforts and whatnot and just accept the reality of what's going on and where we're at
[2:51:06.720 --> 2:51:12.160]  and um and you know i recognize not everyone's in a position to you know you've got day jobs
[2:51:12.160 --> 2:51:17.200]  families and everything else so um you know there's little things you can do though like getting
[2:51:17.200 --> 2:51:21.360]  copies of this dvd and sticking it into people's hands you know certain people in your life that
[2:51:21.360 --> 2:51:26.160]  this could make a difference or that they could it could affect policy change in little areas
[2:51:26.160 --> 2:51:30.640]  take that action do those little steps and you know it'll be death the the new world order is
[2:51:30.640 --> 2:51:34.240]  going to die and it'll be death by a thousand cuts that's that's how they're going to go down
[2:51:34.240 --> 2:51:38.400]  exactly you we're never going to hear about our victories we're never going to get celebrated
[2:51:38.400 --> 2:51:43.360]  it doesn't matter the because here's the deal my last straw is this they're now injecting children
[2:51:43.360 --> 2:51:49.520]  worldwide with this poison the deaths are happening it's going on we are living in a mass genocide
[2:51:49.520 --> 2:51:55.840]  so let's not let's not deny it let's let's just move forward as men we're expendable and just
[2:51:55.840 --> 2:52:00.080]  not worry so many of you worried about your boss worried about your job worried about any of that
[2:52:00.080 --> 2:52:02.800]  you're going to lose all that anyways unless we stop these people
[2:52:05.440 --> 2:52:12.480]  paul get any comments on this yeah yeah and that's why you know we need to fight back and so i think
[2:52:12.480 --> 2:52:19.920]  this is a great way to help people fight back and so because of the censorship you know it's more
[2:52:19.920 --> 2:52:25.920]  important than ever that everyone tries to upload it and share it to people because we need to put
[2:52:25.920 --> 2:52:32.880]  it out in as many fronts as possible because your film is not just a great way i mean i can tell you
[2:52:32.880 --> 2:52:38.080]  when it comes to expose the mass fraud it's the way people should be at city council school boards
[2:52:38.080 --> 2:52:42.080]  introducing this as evidence and demanding they watch it go ahead people should be knocking on
[2:52:42.080 --> 2:52:46.560]  their doors politely of every city council member every board member every school board member saying
[2:52:46.560 --> 2:52:50.480]  hey i want you to watch this and then i want you to give me a response to a continuum
[2:52:50.480 --> 2:52:57.920]  right and people are waking up by the droves and so these kind of tools are ways to get
[2:52:57.920 --> 2:53:04.480]  people more to wake up and i think this is the great uh the greatest tool on the subject of mass
[2:53:04.480 --> 2:53:11.200]  that is out there so um if everyone just goes to covidland.com gets a copy and then especially
[2:53:11.200 --> 2:53:17.040]  shares it once it goes free online that is how we make a difference beautifully said you know
[2:53:17.040 --> 2:53:21.920]  there's so many clips here i haven't gotten to but uh you know going back to liberty man liberty man
[2:53:21.920 --> 2:53:27.760]  like you said it's actually empowering to know this is so real and just to commit to the fight
[2:53:27.760 --> 2:53:32.640]  and so many people are on the sidelines they know it's real but they say what do i do what can they do
[2:53:35.200 --> 2:53:39.040]  well uh you know alex when i when we were involved with this episode two
[2:53:39.760 --> 2:53:44.880]  even when it was rough edits and i was going through it um it would hit me like a ton of
[2:53:44.880 --> 2:53:49.200]  bricks to set so like you'd be watching it and you know what's coming up and everything else
[2:53:49.200 --> 2:53:55.280]  and then there's a certain part in the episode where it just it connects with you at your core
[2:53:55.280 --> 2:54:00.560]  right it cuts right through all the propaganda and all the stuff that's going on in your mind
[2:54:00.560 --> 2:54:07.520]  and it hits you your base humanity and and it's just it's just this realization that it's like
[2:54:09.040 --> 2:54:13.360]  i was born into this you know we all were born into this this whole new world war to think
[2:54:13.360 --> 2:54:17.520]  that this that's culminating at the stage that we're at it was if they were working on this stuff
[2:54:18.160 --> 2:54:22.320]  long long decades and decades ago so this is the world this is just where we're
[2:54:22.960 --> 2:54:26.880]  sorry to interrupt i'll sell my guys later take this clip put it up front in the video sorry
[2:54:26.880 --> 2:54:32.720]  had my mic up and go keep going we were born into this and i think you know it's just this
[2:54:32.720 --> 2:54:39.200]  just get real with it accept it and um get angry about it you know alex uh ten years ago i think
[2:54:39.200 --> 2:54:45.040]  it was there was a what's now a famous rant that you did and it was about you know bill gade the
[2:54:45.040 --> 2:54:51.200]  tech conference you know the chicken neck and and uh but you you you started yelling in that you
[2:54:51.200 --> 2:54:58.480]  said be human again be a man you know and um and i think that was just so powerful that uh
[2:54:59.200 --> 2:55:05.600]  that rant that you did because it was just it's like guys stop put down the the silly little
[2:55:05.600 --> 2:55:11.840]  things that you do uh you know i don't know whatever it is the the video games or the what
[2:55:11.840 --> 2:55:17.600]  have you like you're not a child anymore this is this is our time and we're we're we're adults and
[2:55:17.600 --> 2:55:25.120]  we're in the front lines whether you like it or not you are on this battlefield so um just do the
[2:55:25.120 --> 2:55:29.200]  right thing you know you you're not gonna be on this earth for a very long time you're not gonna
[2:55:29.200 --> 2:55:36.880]  live forever and uh don't you want to look back and say hey guess what i uh here's what i did and
[2:55:36.880 --> 2:55:40.880]  and i think about it you know your your grandkids and whatnot they might ask me one day if you get
[2:55:40.880 --> 2:55:45.920]  to the stage where you've got grandkids um dad what did you do during that time do you really
[2:55:45.920 --> 2:55:51.440]  want to say well you know i was one of those guys that i put on the armband and i snitched and
[2:55:51.440 --> 2:55:57.040]  everything else or do you want to say hell no i i stood my ground i i did not i was principal
[2:55:57.040 --> 2:56:02.640]  i stuck with principles and i stuck with true scientific information and uh i didn't lose
[2:56:02.640 --> 2:56:09.040]  sight of marine i didn't lose control of my own opinions beautifully said liberty man paul wittenberger
[2:56:09.040 --> 2:56:17.040]  closing comments about covet land to the mask well you know in this episode we go into how it's
[2:56:17.040 --> 2:56:22.160]  affecting the children and that's what i think is one of the biggest things that it's affecting is
[2:56:22.160 --> 2:56:30.000]  the children and it baffles my mind that schools even today are still mandating mass so guys go
[2:56:30.000 --> 2:56:36.080]  to your city council meetings and uh get this information out that people need to take these
[2:56:36.080 --> 2:56:42.000]  off and we need to just stop complying beautifully said all right i'm going to come back and zero

[2:58:47.920 --> 2:58:56.160]  you get our great bag of it here i mean this is from people say why is it from Chiapas mexico
[2:58:56.160 --> 2:59:01.360]  the communist well that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested above
[2:59:01.360 --> 2:59:06.560]  organic in the volcanic soil better than guatemalan coffee and yeah we buy it from the little farmers
[2:59:06.560 --> 2:59:10.400]  that you know the media calls communist but really they're just a commune and whatever the point is
[2:59:10.400 --> 2:59:14.480]  is that it's good coffee and we've got it and the farmers don't let the mexican government take over
[2:59:14.480 --> 2:59:18.000]  so i actually buy this from the mexican rebels and i've been buying it for what 14 years and the
[2:59:18.000 --> 2:59:22.480]  price has never gone up the same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more
[2:59:22.480 --> 2:59:26.800]  per pound and i just think it's some of the best coffee you're gonna find anywhere it's wake up america
[2:59:26.800 --> 2:59:33.200]  patriot blend from the Chiapas rebels literally um in fact i'm gonna tell you a little story um
[2:59:34.720 --> 2:59:40.080]  we had like that i don't think you wouldn't believe it anyway so it's infowarstore.com
[2:59:40.080 --> 2:59:43.760]  and that's how we fund this operation and if you don't fund us you don't want to see that's fine
[2:59:43.760 --> 2:59:55.840]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[3:00:02.320 --> 3:00:06.720]  well biden toured the tornadoes he claimed were caused by the general public
[3:00:06.720 --> 3:00:09.440]  i pointed out that weather weapons and said you have more of a history of weather weapons
[3:00:09.440 --> 3:00:13.520]  anybody else i'm saying you did it i'm just saying you claim we did it you might be behind it huge
[3:00:13.520 --> 3:00:18.560]  stories everywhere but we got those clips coming up to say scrammy's a pedo and so much more that's
[3:00:18.560 --> 3:00:25.280]  next segment but here's del big tree in covetland park to the mask one of the first videos to be
[3:00:25.280 --> 3:00:33.120]  incredibly censored i brought my 12 year old son into my studio live television and we bought a
[3:00:33.120 --> 3:00:38.240]  co2 monitor and i put that co2 monitor underneath his mask and i had him wear all the different
[3:00:38.240 --> 3:00:45.360]  masks that we surgical mask on n95 or we even tested the shield in a bandana but what we saw
[3:00:45.360 --> 3:00:50.000]  was incredibly alarming so now we're in a place where he could be having headaches he could be oh
[3:00:50.000 --> 3:00:56.640]  we're at 3786 look at this we've just passed 5000 now we're in the toxic level right now we
[3:00:56.640 --> 3:01:04.480]  can be doing this seven thousand inside this mask the co2 seven eight thousand parts per million
[3:01:04.480 --> 3:01:12.480]  and now he's this thing's gone off the rictor scale folks it can't even register how high the
[3:01:12.480 --> 3:01:19.840]  co2 levels are inside and look how many seconds that was all right can i just yeah you want to take
[3:01:19.840 --> 3:01:27.360]  that off now co2 is what osha monitors that's our government agency that travels around making
[3:01:27.360 --> 3:01:33.360]  sure that the air people breathe in their offices or in their manufacturing plants is healthy they
[3:01:33.360 --> 3:01:39.680]  all have co2 monitors on the wall so that if the co2 level gets too high like a canary in the coal
[3:01:39.680 --> 3:01:44.480]  mine luckily we have one of these monitors we have people rush out of the room until they fix the
[3:01:44.480 --> 3:01:52.720]  problem the body of science around this world shows that masks do not work and in fact tend to
[3:01:52.720 --> 3:01:58.400]  cut oxygen raise co2 levels i've even brought in osha experts on my show that said that's exactly
[3:01:58.400 --> 3:02:04.640]  the study we did and we know that's true we know it denies you oxygen man that's powerful that is in
[3:02:05.200 --> 3:02:10.480]  covenland to the mask get it out now at infowarstore.com amazing here's a few more clips we'll come back
[3:02:10.480 --> 3:02:17.280]  with the big biden news during surgery if a surgeon or a nurse or an anesthesiologist
[3:02:17.280 --> 3:02:23.520]  is wearing an n95 or even a surgical mask or an ear loop mask in that surgical suite if they touch
[3:02:23.520 --> 3:02:29.040]  that mask one time they have to either exit the room or a nurse aid has to help them change it
[3:02:29.040 --> 3:02:35.200]  out without touching it the second you touch your mask not only are you cross contaminating that mask
[3:02:35.200 --> 3:02:40.720]  but you are reducing its likelihood to control a hazard the maximum amount of time that you can
[3:02:40.720 --> 3:02:47.360]  wear a surgical mask in a hospital setting or a surgical center is two hours that's max right and
[3:02:47.360 --> 3:02:51.600]  even then they have to have work rest cycles they have to properly down and off them by the ear loops
[3:02:51.600 --> 3:02:56.240]  you can't just grab because you contaminate it's called fomite transmission your hands
[3:02:56.240 --> 3:03:00.560]  have bacteria on them from what you're touching in the environment around you so when you touch
[3:03:00.560 --> 3:03:06.560]  that face mask you now breathe in that pathogen or that contaminant through fomite transmission
[3:03:06.560 --> 3:03:12.480]  so there is a lot to the PPE standard whenever we give an employee personal protective equipment
[3:03:12.480 --> 3:03:17.280]  there's a lot of requirements that we have to follow through with and it all has to be documented
[3:03:17.280 --> 3:03:23.120]  yet what OSHA is doing right now with this mask you know this blanket mask mandate they're not
[3:03:23.120 --> 3:03:28.160]  following any of it and they're getting away with it because they've changed the name it's not PPE
[3:03:28.160 --> 3:03:34.720]  anymore it's now they call it community protection or whatever but i'm sorry you can't have your cake
[3:03:34.720 --> 3:03:39.120]  and eat it too if you're requiring people to put something on to protect them or somebody else
[3:03:39.120 --> 3:03:45.520]  it's personal protective equipment it falls under the PPE standard we've seen so many increases
[3:03:45.520 --> 3:03:49.280]  of bacterial respiratory infections in our private practices over the last 12 months
[3:03:49.280 --> 3:03:54.320]  it's not even funny we've seen so many fungal infections because people are improperly wearing
[3:03:54.320 --> 3:04:01.120]  masks whenever we get fitted for our mask because i also am part owner of two surgical centers
[3:04:01.120 --> 3:04:05.920]  here in the greater st louis area when we're in our surgical center ladies and gentlemen you know
[3:04:05.920 --> 3:04:10.640]  i just have no word to describe how important this film is and that's why that caller that
[3:04:10.640 --> 3:04:15.120]  called in two hours ago saying how dare you sell anything that makes me want to throw up how the
[3:04:15.120 --> 3:04:21.360]  hell are we supposed to produce films with this quality interviewing 50 60 people and putting
[3:04:21.360 --> 3:04:27.040]  all this together and then printing DVDs and give it away for free it's just sick it's sick it's sick
[3:04:28.640 --> 3:04:32.720]  i am putting this film out at cost to get it to people it's so professional
[3:04:32.720 --> 3:04:36.800]  it's how we counter the lies they're trying to shut us down because the truth is so powerful

[3:05:12.480 --> 3:05:18.560]  caught flat footed but they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization

[3:06:14.320 --> 3:06:19.680]  arping on wars we fight and griping about the way things are to be
[3:06:19.680 --> 3:06:27.600]  and i don't mind them switching sides and standing up for things they believe in
[3:06:28.480 --> 3:06:35.040]  but when they're running down my country man they're walking on the fighting side of me yeah
[3:06:36.480 --> 3:06:44.080]  yeah walking on the fighting side of me running down a way of life running down the way of life

[3:06:49.600 --> 3:06:54.160]  found in this country were not chicken you know what pieces of garbage that were threatened by
[3:06:54.160 --> 3:06:59.760]  people being free they wanted to see you be free these globalists are running this country down

[3:11:43.600 --> 3:11:50.160]  their plan the build back better plan is to bankrupt the nation and then make us think our

[3:13:29.440 --> 3:13:33.520]  we are and recognize who we are and recognize we're about to be given the keys to heaven we're
[3:13:33.520 --> 3:13:39.040]  about to transcend on the next level and there are certain forces that don't want us to have those
[3:13:39.040 --> 3:13:44.480]  keys and they're trying to seduce us and trying to set up a group of our own people to sell us out
[3:13:44.480 --> 3:13:48.800]  so we're not part of that destiny don't let them have it and that's why they're so scared about
[3:13:48.800 --> 3:13:53.360]  reset wars is why they try to use the internet spam systems to block people that got memberships

[3:20:38.040 --> 3:20:39.040]  Yeah, Alex said it.
[3:20:39.040 --> 3:20:42.040]  You better do everything you can to support Inforcedore.
[3:20:42.040 --> 3:20:47.040]  Our lives are on the line, literally, factually.
[3:20:47.040 --> 3:20:50.040]  No facts, no life, no freedom,
[3:20:50.040 --> 3:20:53.040]  no choice, no freedom of choice, it's gone.
[3:20:53.040 --> 3:20:56.040]  So do everything you can to support Inforcedore.
[3:20:56.040 --> 3:21:00.040]  You know, today, yesterday, of course,
[3:21:00.040 --> 3:21:04.040]  the fed, the fed, the gangster banksters,
[3:21:04.040 --> 3:21:07.040]  the low-life pieces of scum crap,
[3:21:07.040 --> 3:21:13.040]  that that murderous SOB Woodrow Wilson invented
[3:21:13.040 --> 3:21:19.040]  back 108 years ago, the central bank.
[3:21:19.040 --> 3:21:24.040]  The guy, the fed head over there, Jerome Powell,
[3:21:24.040 --> 3:21:29.040]  that at this time last year was throwing out his BS.
[3:21:29.040 --> 3:21:32.040]  Hey, there's no inflation.
[3:21:32.040 --> 3:21:34.040]  Salente, you're Trends Journal.
[3:21:34.040 --> 3:21:37.040]  You're talking about inflation coming up.
[3:21:37.040 --> 3:21:39.040]  You don't know what you're talking about.
[3:21:39.040 --> 3:21:41.040]  We're the feds.
[3:21:41.040 --> 3:21:43.040]  We know everything.
[3:21:43.040 --> 3:21:46.040]  There's no inflation.
[3:21:46.040 --> 3:21:50.040]  It's temporary.
[3:21:50.040 --> 3:21:56.040]  And then it became transitory.
[3:21:56.040 --> 3:21:59.040]  And now, well, you know, it's here.
[3:21:59.040 --> 3:22:01.040]  And now we're going to raise interest rates.
[3:22:01.040 --> 3:22:07.040]  We're going to cut back on our bond-buying scheme.
[3:22:07.040 --> 3:22:09.040]  It's unprecedented.
[3:22:09.040 --> 3:22:15.040]  Inflation is at nearly a 40-year high.
[3:22:15.040 --> 3:22:19.040]  And actually, when you put in the real inflation number,
[3:22:19.040 --> 3:22:21.040]  no, it's not 6.8%.
[3:22:21.040 --> 3:22:26.040]  It's 15%, according to John William Shadow stats.
[3:22:26.040 --> 3:22:33.040]  Because the low-life scum politicians,
[3:22:33.040 --> 3:22:36.040]  we're going to change what inflation really means.
[3:22:36.040 --> 3:22:38.040]  Hey, the price of steak went up.
[3:22:38.040 --> 3:22:40.040]  No, it didn't.
[3:22:40.040 --> 3:22:42.040]  People stopped eating steak.
[3:22:42.040 --> 3:22:45.040]  People were eating ground beef.
[3:22:45.040 --> 3:22:47.040]  So it didn't go up.
[3:22:47.040 --> 3:22:50.040]  They just changed.
[3:22:50.040 --> 3:22:52.040]  Oh, what else?
[3:22:52.040 --> 3:22:54.040]  Oh, housing prices?
[3:22:54.040 --> 3:22:57.040]  What, they went up, what, 19% this year?
[3:22:57.040 --> 3:22:59.040]  No, they didn't go up at all.
[3:22:59.040 --> 3:23:04.040]  We're not putting that into the inflation number.
[3:23:04.040 --> 3:23:06.040]  There she is.
[3:23:06.040 --> 3:23:08.040]  Janet Yellen.
[3:23:08.040 --> 3:23:10.040]  Yellen out, crap.
[3:23:10.040 --> 3:23:13.040]  That's right, that's all she ever yells out.
[3:23:13.040 --> 3:23:16.040]  Yellen was yelling, there's no inflation.
[3:23:16.040 --> 3:23:18.040]  Well, we're the same age, model,
[3:23:18.040 --> 3:23:20.040]  and I hope I don't look as bad as her.
[3:23:20.040 --> 3:23:22.040]  Fatcha Brut.
[3:23:22.040 --> 3:23:23.040]  Look at her.
[3:23:23.040 --> 3:23:24.040]  Look at her.
[3:23:24.040 --> 3:23:27.040]  That's our Treasury Secretary.
[3:23:27.040 --> 3:23:29.040]  That makes you feel good, doesn't it?
[3:23:29.040 --> 3:23:31.040]  That really makes you feel solid.
[3:23:31.040 --> 3:23:33.040]  A bankster banned it.
[3:23:33.040 --> 3:23:35.040]  She came from the central bank,
[3:23:35.040 --> 3:23:37.040]  and now she's our Treasury Secretary.
[3:23:37.040 --> 3:23:40.040]  Again, one administration after another.
[3:23:40.040 --> 3:23:42.040]  It's a criminal gang.
[3:23:42.040 --> 3:23:47.040]  Anyway, so on the news yesterday
[3:23:47.040 --> 3:23:50.040]  that they're going to cut back on bond buying,
[3:23:50.040 --> 3:23:55.040]  and again, this is not a capitalist society.
[3:23:55.040 --> 3:23:57.040]  It's fascism.
[3:23:57.040 --> 3:24:00.040]  It's the merger of state and corporate powers.
[3:24:00.040 --> 3:24:03.040]  You're a guy by the name of Mussolini.
[3:24:03.040 --> 3:24:08.040]  That Mussolini?
[3:24:08.040 --> 3:24:10.040]  That's his quote.
[3:24:10.040 --> 3:24:12.040]  When I was a kid, by the way,
[3:24:12.040 --> 3:24:14.040]  it was whistle while you work,
[3:24:14.040 --> 3:24:17.040]  Hitler is a jerk, Mussolini bit his weenie.
[3:24:17.040 --> 3:24:19.040]  Now it doesn't work.
[3:24:19.040 --> 3:24:23.040]  Anyway, the merger of state and corporate powers
[3:24:23.040 --> 3:24:28.040]  buying up corporate bonds here and around the world.
[3:24:28.040 --> 3:24:34.040]  ECB, Japan, it's fascism.
[3:24:34.040 --> 3:24:36.040]  The bigs have gotten bigger.
[3:24:36.040 --> 3:24:38.040]  Again, one of the articles we have each week
[3:24:38.040 --> 3:24:42.040]  in the Trends Journal, bigs getting bigger.
[3:24:42.040 --> 3:24:43.040]  Buying up everything.
[3:24:43.040 --> 3:24:45.040]  They're getting all this cheap money,
[3:24:45.040 --> 3:24:48.040]  merger and acquisition activity going off the roof,
[3:24:48.040 --> 3:24:50.040]  going back to inflation.
[3:24:50.040 --> 3:24:52.040]  So yesterday the markets go up.
[3:24:52.040 --> 3:24:57.040]  Oh, good news, but they're going to be today.
[3:24:57.040 --> 3:25:04.040]  As we speak, the Nasdaq, the tech heavy Nasdaq,
[3:25:04.040 --> 3:25:08.040]  down 2.5%.
[3:25:08.040 --> 3:25:14.040]  This morning, the Dow was up over 200 points.
[3:25:14.040 --> 3:25:21.040]  Just before I went on the air, it was down 60 points.
[3:25:21.040 --> 3:25:23.040]  That's right.
[3:25:23.040 --> 3:25:30.040]  It was up over 200, and now it was down 60.
[3:25:30.040 --> 3:25:33.040]  The reality is hitting the streets.
[3:25:33.040 --> 3:25:39.040]  Gold prices spiked up just before I came on the air.
[3:25:39.040 --> 3:25:42.040]  $34.
[3:25:42.040 --> 3:25:49.040]  Silver up 4%.
[3:25:49.040 --> 3:25:53.040]  This thing is going to go down big and hard.
[3:25:53.040 --> 3:25:56.040]  As I said, the real inflation rate,
[3:25:56.040 --> 3:26:02.040]  even if you look at the fake one that they're giving us,
[3:26:02.040 --> 3:26:05.040]  it's at 6.8%.
[3:26:05.040 --> 3:26:08.040]  What's the Fed rate overnight?
[3:26:08.040 --> 3:26:10.040]  Near zero.
[3:26:10.040 --> 3:26:11.040]  Now, wait a minute.
[3:26:11.040 --> 3:26:13.040]  You've got a Fed rate near zero,
[3:26:13.040 --> 3:26:16.040]  and you've got an inflation rate at 6.8%.
[3:26:16.040 --> 3:26:20.040]  You have negative interest rates.
[3:26:20.040 --> 3:26:27.040]  So even with the negative interest rates,
[3:26:27.040 --> 3:26:30.040]  they're afraid that they're going to go up.
[3:26:30.040 --> 3:26:35.040]  So the money junkies won't be able to get their free money.
[3:26:35.040 --> 3:26:39.040]  This inflation isn't going down.
[3:26:39.040 --> 3:26:44.040]  It's not about only the supply chain disruptions.
[3:26:44.040 --> 3:26:49.040]  What it's about is all of the cheap money
[3:26:49.040 --> 3:26:52.040]  that they've been dumping into the system.
[3:26:52.040 --> 3:26:54.040]  And it's global.
[3:26:54.040 --> 3:26:56.040]  The Netherlands just announced yesterday,
[3:26:56.040 --> 3:26:59.040]  yep, we've got to throw more money in.
[3:26:59.040 --> 3:27:02.040]  Yeah, because we're locking down everything.
[3:27:02.040 --> 3:27:06.040]  Businesses are going down the crapper.
[3:27:06.040 --> 3:27:11.040]  Oh, here.
[3:27:11.040 --> 3:27:16.040]  Transatlantic and European air travel plummet.
[3:27:16.040 --> 3:27:19.040]  Bookings between the United States and Europe
[3:27:19.040 --> 3:27:26.040]  for the period starting November 29th.
[3:27:26.040 --> 3:27:40.040]  Down over 75% from the pre-COVID war days of 2019.
[3:27:40.040 --> 3:27:50.040]  Back in November 2019 compared to now.
[3:27:50.040 --> 3:27:55.040]  Down from 75%.
[3:27:55.040 --> 3:28:00.040]  JPMorgan Chase just canceled a big health conference
[3:28:00.040 --> 3:28:02.040]  in San Francisco.
[3:28:02.040 --> 3:28:07.040]  Trade shows, conventions being canceled.
[3:28:07.040 --> 3:28:09.040]  Going to get the COVID, going to get the COVID.
[3:28:09.040 --> 3:28:11.040]  Omicron's going to get you.
[3:28:11.040 --> 3:28:13.040]  Omicron's going to get you.
[3:28:13.040 --> 3:28:15.040]  COVID didn't, Delta didn't.
[3:28:15.040 --> 3:28:17.040]  Omicron, Omicron will get you.
[3:28:17.040 --> 3:28:19.040]  People freaking out.
[3:28:19.040 --> 3:28:22.040]  What's that doing to the convention and trade show business?
[3:28:22.040 --> 3:28:23.040]  Oh, what's that?
[3:28:23.040 --> 3:28:25.040]  I've never heard of those before.
[3:28:25.040 --> 3:28:27.040]  Yeah, they're gone.
[3:28:27.040 --> 3:28:30.040]  They're gone and so too is the economy.
[3:28:30.040 --> 3:28:32.040]  And now they're doing it this Christmas time.
[3:28:32.040 --> 3:28:37.040]  Yeah, Santa Claus ain't coming to town, man.
[3:28:37.040 --> 3:28:39.040]  This is going down big.
[3:28:39.040 --> 3:28:42.040]  It's going to go down hard.
[3:28:42.040 --> 3:28:44.040]  And you better prepare for the future.
[3:28:44.040 --> 3:28:47.040]  And when we get back, we're going to tell you how
[3:28:47.040 --> 3:28:50.040]  you should consider doing it.
[3:28:50.040 --> 3:28:53.040]  We'll be right back.
[3:28:53.040 --> 3:28:55.040]  You know, listeners.
[3:28:55.040 --> 3:28:57.040]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[3:28:57.040 --> 3:28:59.040]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[3:28:59.040 --> 3:29:00.040]  Welcome.
[3:29:00.040 --> 3:29:01.040]  Hello, Alex.
[3:29:01.040 --> 3:29:02.040]  Yes, Malcolm.
[3:29:02.040 --> 3:29:04.040]  All right, I will make this quick and real short
[3:29:04.040 --> 3:29:06.040]  where the other patriots can get on the line.
[3:29:06.040 --> 3:29:09.040]  So one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Schreuer,
[3:29:09.040 --> 3:29:12.040]  SuperMailVitality and Brainforce Plus.
[3:29:12.040 --> 3:29:14.040]  Mix those two together.
[3:29:14.040 --> 3:29:15.040]  You're an unstoppable tank.
[3:29:15.040 --> 3:29:17.040]  SuperMailVitality really, really works.
[3:29:17.040 --> 3:29:20.040]  It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds
[3:29:20.040 --> 3:29:22.040]  that have never been heated up.
[3:29:22.040 --> 3:29:26.040]  And so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions.
[3:29:26.040 --> 3:29:29.040]  They also work quite well, but just aren't as strong.
[3:29:29.040 --> 3:29:31.040]  This is like a very fine wine.
[3:29:31.040 --> 3:29:33.040]  In fact, each batch is different.
[3:29:33.040 --> 3:29:34.040]  Sometimes it's super strong.
[3:29:34.040 --> 3:29:35.040]  Sometimes it's just OK.
[3:29:35.040 --> 3:29:37.040]  People are like, why are you selling something
[3:29:37.040 --> 3:29:39.040]  and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as strong?
[3:29:39.040 --> 3:29:40.040]  That's just how it is.
[3:29:40.040 --> 3:29:41.040]  It's how it works.
[3:29:41.040 --> 3:29:43.040]  So it's always good.
[3:29:43.040 --> 3:29:45.040]  It's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[3:29:45.040 --> 3:29:48.040]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price,
[3:29:48.040 --> 3:30:13.040]  this is it.
[3:30:13.040 --> 3:30:38.040]  We have the entire line of Silent Pocket ready to shift to you
[3:30:38.040 --> 3:30:40.040]  when you visit InfowarsStore.com.
[3:30:40.040 --> 3:30:43.040]  Again, we have big backpacks. We have special dry bags.
[3:30:43.040 --> 3:30:46.040]  We've got them for cell phones. We've got them for laptops.
[3:30:46.040 --> 3:30:47.040]  We've got them for iPads.
[3:30:47.040 --> 3:30:50.040]  It's all there at InfowarsStore.com.
[3:30:50.040 --> 3:30:53.040]  So protect your privacy today and support the Infowar
[3:30:53.040 --> 3:30:55.040]  at InfowarsStore.com.
[3:30:55.040 --> 3:31:00.040]  I am a worldly person, meaning I like going to ball games.
[3:31:00.040 --> 3:31:01.040]  I like going to concerts.
[3:31:01.040 --> 3:31:02.040]  I like going to play golf.
[3:31:02.040 --> 3:31:04.040]  I like going out to dinner.
[3:31:04.040 --> 3:31:06.040]  I like the Metropolitan life.
[3:31:06.040 --> 3:31:08.040]  I like everything that comes with this.
[3:31:08.040 --> 3:31:11.040]  But see, I have the survival instinct
[3:31:11.040 --> 3:31:14.040]  that is to get the hell out of Democrat-run cities,
[3:31:14.040 --> 3:31:17.040]  get the hell out of major metropolitan areas,
[3:31:17.040 --> 3:31:20.040]  because unless we change course soon, it's all crashing down.
[3:31:20.040 --> 3:31:22.040]  Is it time to just move out to the woods,
[3:31:22.040 --> 3:31:24.040]  just time to go get a piece of property in the woods,
[3:31:24.040 --> 3:31:27.040]  just get off grid, just get the emergency food supplies,
[3:31:27.040 --> 3:31:28.040]  just live off the land?
[3:31:28.040 --> 3:31:30.040]  That's the survival instinct.
[3:31:30.040 --> 3:31:32.040]  But see, the worldly part of me that's still probably
[3:31:32.040 --> 3:31:34.040]  the majority part of me says, no, no, no, no, no.
[3:31:34.040 --> 3:31:35.040]  Stay in the city.
[3:31:35.040 --> 3:31:38.040]  The survival instinct says, get the hell out of anywhere
[3:31:38.040 --> 3:31:40.040]  there's ever notion that you need to get a vaccine or a mask.
[3:31:40.040 --> 3:31:43.040]  That's the internal struggle that my guess is
[3:31:43.040 --> 3:31:46.040]  a lot of you in the audience are facing as well.
[3:31:46.040 --> 3:31:49.040]  But you can at least have some comfort
[3:31:49.040 --> 3:31:51.040]  if you have the emergency food supplies.
[3:31:51.040 --> 3:31:54.040]  And so we have the best ones at InfowarsStore.com.
[3:31:54.040 --> 3:32:06.040]  We have developed the research and the tools to stop this evil
[3:32:06.040 --> 3:32:09.040]  and to break free from it and to help others break free from it.
[3:32:09.040 --> 3:32:12.040]  That's why we've launched Reset Wars.
[3:32:12.040 --> 3:32:15.040]  Once you simply accept that there is an incredibly evil group
[3:32:15.040 --> 3:32:18.040]  of people in the world that are attempting the great reset
[3:32:18.040 --> 3:32:20.040]  and want a one-world corporate government,
[3:32:20.040 --> 3:32:22.040]  then you can learn how to defeat them
[3:32:22.040 --> 3:32:24.040]  with intense research.
[3:32:24.040 --> 3:32:28.040]  Our quest to discover the key to breaking the globalist bonds
[3:32:28.040 --> 3:32:30.040]  is now life.
[3:32:30.040 --> 3:32:33.040]  The Reset Wars have begun.
[3:32:33.040 --> 3:32:37.040]  Start your journey at resetwars.com today.
[3:32:37.040 --> 3:32:40.040]  Your programming are very subconscious on our side key
[3:32:40.040 --> 3:32:43.040]  to create these false constructs that they then control.
[3:32:43.040 --> 3:32:45.040]  We're going to lay out how that works.
[3:32:45.040 --> 3:32:48.040]  Your journey against tyranny and true empowerment begins
[3:32:48.040 --> 3:32:50.040]  at resetwars.com.
[3:32:50.040 --> 3:32:52.040]  Find me there.
[3:33:20.040 --> 3:33:26.040]  And now, your host, Gerald Salente.
[3:33:26.040 --> 3:33:29.040]  Great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[3:33:29.040 --> 3:33:33.040]  And as he said, this is a time to support him and the crew.
[3:33:33.040 --> 3:33:35.040]  It's a great crew of people.
[3:33:35.040 --> 3:33:38.040]  They give everything they have to make this happen.
[3:33:38.040 --> 3:33:43.040]  So put your money where your heart is because this is going down.
[3:33:43.040 --> 3:33:49.040]  The natural liberty of man is to be free from any superior power
[3:33:49.040 --> 3:33:55.040]  on earth and not to be under the will or legislative authority
[3:33:55.040 --> 3:34:04.040]  of man, but only to have the laws of nature for his rule.
[3:34:04.040 --> 3:34:07.040]  You know what kind of conspiracy theorists said this?
[3:34:07.040 --> 3:34:11.040]  The law of nature? What law of nature?
[3:34:11.040 --> 3:34:13.040]  You don't need a law of nature.
[3:34:13.040 --> 3:34:16.040]  Only science.
[3:34:16.040 --> 3:34:19.040]  That's what they call it, drug dealers.
[3:34:19.040 --> 3:34:23.040]  Oh, that was Samuel Adams.
[3:34:23.040 --> 3:34:25.040]  Yeah.
[3:34:25.040 --> 3:34:28.040]  The natural liberty of man is gone.
[3:34:28.040 --> 3:34:37.040]  We got a bunch of little clowns in a country, state,
[3:34:37.040 --> 3:34:44.040]  and city near you in areas, the Fauci boy, Fauci fraud,
[3:34:44.040 --> 3:34:48.040]  a little got sound, a little arrogant, nothing.
[3:34:48.040 --> 3:34:51.040]  This is the guy that sold the AIDS fear.
[3:34:51.040 --> 3:34:53.040]  Oh, yeah, don't have sex.
[3:34:53.040 --> 3:34:54.040]  Don't have sex.
[3:34:54.040 --> 3:34:55.040]  Oh, yeah.
[3:34:55.040 --> 3:34:56.040]  Remember, too.
[3:34:56.040 --> 3:34:58.040]  He said, yeah, don't shake hands.
[3:34:58.040 --> 3:35:02.040]  That little jerk off over there, throwing that ball over there.
[3:35:02.040 --> 3:35:03.040]  Don't shake hands.
[3:35:03.040 --> 3:35:10.040]  This is the little lying SOB that was quoted on CBS saying,
[3:35:10.040 --> 3:35:14.040]  the masks are worthless.
[3:35:14.040 --> 3:35:21.040]  This is the little lying SOB that sends an email to one of
[3:35:21.040 --> 3:35:24.040]  Obama's former people.
[3:35:24.040 --> 3:35:28.040]  Think she was Health and Human Service Secretary or something.
[3:35:28.040 --> 3:35:29.040]  She was going to travel.
[3:35:29.040 --> 3:35:32.040]  He said, no, you don't put the airport, wear them to the airport,
[3:35:32.040 --> 3:35:33.040]  the mask.
[3:35:33.040 --> 3:35:34.040]  They don't do anything.
[3:35:34.040 --> 3:35:37.040]  And there he is.
[3:35:37.040 --> 3:35:40.040]  Yep, one after another.
[3:35:40.040 --> 3:35:42.040]  Just like that clown over there that got in the U.K.
[3:35:42.040 --> 3:35:45.040]  Or is it the FU You Know What K?
[3:35:45.040 --> 3:35:46.040]  Yeah, Boris Johnson.
[3:35:46.040 --> 3:35:54.040]  You cannot get a cartoonist and create a more ignorant,
[3:35:54.040 --> 3:36:00.040]  moronic, stupid-looking piece of garbage scum than that little
[3:36:00.040 --> 3:36:03.040]  jerk off over there in the U.K.
[3:36:03.040 --> 3:36:09.040]  That gets caught holding Christmas parties as he tells everybody
[3:36:09.040 --> 3:36:11.040]  else to lock down.
[3:36:11.040 --> 3:36:13.040]  One place after another.
[3:36:13.040 --> 3:36:18.040]  That half-breed over there that's the mayor of San Francisco.
[3:36:18.040 --> 3:36:20.040]  Oh, San Francisco is great.
[3:36:20.040 --> 3:36:22.040]  Yeah, homeless everywhere.
[3:36:22.040 --> 3:36:24.040]  Smashing grab.
[3:36:24.040 --> 3:36:26.040]  That's the way to go.
[3:36:26.040 --> 3:36:32.040]  Matter of fact, today's Financial Times.
[3:36:32.040 --> 3:36:36.040]  Story right up in front.
[3:36:36.040 --> 3:36:39.040]  Where is it of in here?
[3:36:39.040 --> 3:36:46.040]  There's page two or something about what's going on in America
[3:36:46.040 --> 3:36:50.040]  with all of the smashing grabs.
[3:36:50.040 --> 3:36:53.040]  And another article.
[3:36:53.040 --> 3:36:59.040]  Investors pour billions into inflation-linked assets.
[3:36:59.040 --> 3:37:02.040]  Okay?
[3:37:02.040 --> 3:37:05.040]  Because we're going into drag flation.
[3:37:05.040 --> 3:37:14.040]  We're going into a time where the economy's going to go down big time
[3:37:14.040 --> 3:37:16.040]  and inflation's going to keep going.
[3:37:16.040 --> 3:37:20.040]  Here it is.
[3:37:20.040 --> 3:37:28.040]  U.S. stores targeted by gangs of organized thieves.
[3:37:28.040 --> 3:37:31.040]  Oh, you mean Republicans and Democrats?
[3:37:31.040 --> 3:37:32.040]  That crime syndicate?
[3:37:32.040 --> 3:37:33.040]  No, Salenti.
[3:37:33.040 --> 3:37:34.040]  No, no, no.
[3:37:34.040 --> 3:37:39.040]  These are small-time organized criminals.
[3:37:39.040 --> 3:37:41.040]  Look what's going on.
[3:37:41.040 --> 3:37:46.040]  We warned about all of this in the Trends Journal when the COVID
[3:37:46.040 --> 3:37:50.040]  war broke out in 2020.
[3:37:50.040 --> 3:37:55.040]  When all else fails, number one, they take you to war.
[3:37:55.040 --> 3:38:00.040]  And number two, when people lose everything and have nothing left to lose,
[3:38:00.040 --> 3:38:02.040]  they lose it.
[3:38:02.040 --> 3:38:05.040]  And lose it they are.
[3:38:05.040 --> 3:38:17.040]  They quit their jobs making nothing at Dollar General, at Amazon, at Starbucks,
[3:38:17.040 --> 3:38:22.040]  at Home Depot, at Lowe's.
[3:38:22.040 --> 3:38:25.040]  How low can you go?
[3:38:25.040 --> 3:38:29.040]  So when they lock down everything, oh, you remember they're going to flatten the curve?
[3:38:29.040 --> 3:38:30.040]  Oh, yes, stay home.
[3:38:30.040 --> 3:38:31.040]  We know what we're doing.
[3:38:31.040 --> 3:38:32.040]  We're going to flatten the coiff.
[3:38:32.040 --> 3:38:35.040]  Everything's going to be okay.
[3:38:35.040 --> 3:38:37.040]  If people are saying, if they're staying home,
[3:38:37.040 --> 3:38:41.040]  I don't want to go back to work, I hate that job.
[3:38:41.040 --> 3:38:43.040]  And then they see the criminality at their work.
[3:38:43.040 --> 3:38:50.040]  And if they could be criminals, why can't I?
[3:38:50.040 --> 3:38:55.040]  It's inflation going back to that.
[3:38:55.040 --> 3:38:59.040]  It's big.
[3:38:59.040 --> 3:39:03.040]  It's not going away.
[3:39:03.040 --> 3:39:07.040]  And here's the other thing that's very important.
[3:39:07.040 --> 3:39:15.040]  When interest rates go up, what happens to the debt?
[3:39:15.040 --> 3:39:19.040]  Oh, they just increased the debt limit by what, $2.5 trillion?
[3:39:19.040 --> 3:39:20.040]  Just put more money in it?
[3:39:20.040 --> 3:39:24.040]  You got a $30 trillion debt?
[3:39:24.040 --> 3:39:28.040]  Now your interest rates go up, you've got to pay more across the board.
[3:39:28.040 --> 3:39:35.040]  And that's why we're writing about in the magazine what's going to happen with the junk bond market.
[3:39:35.040 --> 3:39:43.040]  And now with all of these restrictions going on,
[3:39:43.040 --> 3:39:48.040]  what's going to happen to the hospitality sector?
[3:39:48.040 --> 3:39:50.040]  What's going to happen to restaurants?
[3:39:50.040 --> 3:39:55.040]  This is Christmas time.
[3:39:55.040 --> 3:39:58.040]  What's going to happen to the debt?
[3:39:58.040 --> 3:40:09.040]  What's going to happen when you only have a 40% occupancy rate,
[3:40:09.040 --> 3:40:12.040]  office occupancy rate in the United States?
[3:40:12.040 --> 3:40:16.040]  40% office occupancy rate.
[3:40:16.040 --> 3:40:21.040]  I mean 60% of the people aren't going there.
[3:40:21.040 --> 3:40:28.040]  What happens to all the businesses that depend on commuters?
[3:40:28.040 --> 3:40:35.040]  What happens when people are afraid to travel and business travel goes down the toilet?
[3:40:35.040 --> 3:40:41.040]  Where they should flush fouchy and all the rest of them down there?
[3:40:41.040 --> 3:40:47.040]  What happens to commercial real estate?
[3:40:47.040 --> 3:40:49.040]  It's dead.
[3:40:49.040 --> 3:40:54.040]  The streets are dead.
[3:40:54.040 --> 3:40:56.040]  When I was a kid it was 10 p.m.
[3:40:56.040 --> 3:40:58.040]  Do you know where your children are?
[3:40:58.040 --> 3:40:59.040]  We're wild.
[3:40:59.040 --> 3:41:02.040]  They couldn't control us.
[3:41:02.040 --> 3:41:07.040]  Now it's 9 p.m.
[3:41:07.040 --> 3:41:11.040]  Empty.
[3:41:11.040 --> 3:41:15.040]  One after another.
[3:41:15.040 --> 3:41:25.040]  Now you got these debt levels, interest rates going up.
[3:41:25.040 --> 3:41:34.040]  You ready for a market crash in commercial real estate?
[3:41:34.040 --> 3:41:38.040]  What do you take if you take a place like America,
[3:41:38.040 --> 3:41:47.040]  let's say 60% of the people that are vaccinated, 40% aren't?
[3:41:47.040 --> 3:41:51.040]  Let's say 30% go down to that number.
[3:41:51.040 --> 3:41:55.040]  What happens when you lose 30% of your businesses?
[3:41:55.040 --> 3:42:02.040]  A buddy of mine puts on major concerts just at one last Friday.
[3:42:02.040 --> 3:42:07.040]  He sold out.
[3:42:07.040 --> 3:42:11.040]  Over 30% of the people didn't show up.
[3:42:11.040 --> 3:42:13.040]  They paid for their tickets.
[3:42:13.040 --> 3:42:16.040]  They didn't even ask for the money back.
[3:42:16.040 --> 3:42:18.040]  They didn't show up.
[3:42:18.040 --> 3:42:20.040]  And you know why?
[3:42:20.040 --> 3:42:23.040]  Ah, Macron's going to get you.
[3:42:23.040 --> 3:42:26.040]  Ah, Macron's going to get you.
[3:42:26.040 --> 3:42:29.040]  Yep.
[3:42:29.040 --> 3:42:34.040]  Even though they say, well, one person died out of 8 billion,
[3:42:34.040 --> 3:42:39.040]  but they're scaring people to death.
[3:42:39.040 --> 3:42:42.040]  They're killing people by scaring them to death.
[3:42:42.040 --> 3:42:47.040]  Opiates, whoop, off the charts, homicides, whoop.
[3:42:47.040 --> 3:42:48.040]  They're killing us.
[3:42:48.040 --> 3:42:49.040]  And we'll be right back.
[3:42:49.040 --> 3:43:00.040]  Remember, supported for wars.
[3:43:19.040 --> 3:43:22.040]  After decades of intense research,
[3:43:22.040 --> 3:43:28.040]  our quest to discover the key to breaking the globalist bonds is now life.
[3:43:28.040 --> 3:43:31.040]  The reset wars have begun.
[3:43:31.040 --> 3:43:35.040]  Start your journey at resetwars.com today.
[3:43:35.040 --> 3:43:38.040]  Your programming are very subconscious in our psyche
[3:43:38.040 --> 3:43:42.040]  to create these false constructs that they then control.
[3:43:42.040 --> 3:43:44.040]  We're going to lay out how that works.
[3:43:44.040 --> 3:43:48.040]  Your journey against tyranny and true empowerment begins at resetwars.com.
[3:43:48.040 --> 3:43:50.040]  Please join me there.
[3:44:18.040 --> 3:44:19.040]  Energy.
[3:44:19.040 --> 3:44:22.040]  They're using it to buy people, to buy influence.
[3:44:22.040 --> 3:44:25.040]  And in the past, they created thousands of trillions
[3:44:25.040 --> 3:44:28.040]  so that they could leverage that manipulate market
[3:44:28.040 --> 3:44:31.040]  so they never allowed that money to get into the general circulation
[3:44:31.040 --> 3:44:33.040]  or it would cause massive inflation.
[3:44:33.040 --> 3:44:35.040]  Now they've gone ahead and weaponized it
[3:44:35.040 --> 3:44:38.040]  and are flooding every sector of the world economy
[3:44:38.040 --> 3:44:40.040]  buying up everything.
[3:44:40.040 --> 3:44:42.040]  Not to have the companies operate,
[3:44:42.040 --> 3:44:44.040]  but to actually shut them down
[3:44:44.040 --> 3:44:46.040]  and force a collapse of civilization,
[3:44:46.040 --> 3:44:48.040]  making the companies they do fund
[3:44:48.040 --> 3:44:50.040]  are the only things left standing.
[3:44:50.040 --> 3:44:51.040]  This is the great reset.
[3:44:51.040 --> 3:44:52.040]  This is what's happening now.
[3:44:52.040 --> 3:44:53.040]  War on everyone.
[3:44:53.040 --> 3:44:55.040]  It's the only way to stop it.
[3:44:55.040 --> 3:44:59.040]  So this could be literally your last chance
[3:44:59.040 --> 3:45:01.040]  with all the insane things happening in the world

[3:45:45.040 --> 3:45:47.040]  This could be potentially your last chance
[3:45:47.040 --> 3:45:49.040]  to get a t-shirt, a book, a film,
[3:45:49.040 --> 3:45:50.040]  or these great supplements.
[3:45:50.040 --> 3:45:52.040]  We're going to keep going 110%,
[3:45:52.040 --> 3:45:54.040]  but we need your support.
[3:45:54.040 --> 3:45:59.040]  In late August, Infowars saw an explosion of orders
[3:45:59.040 --> 3:46:01.040]  because our audience understands
[3:46:01.040 --> 3:46:04.040]  that the globalists are destabilizing the planet
[3:46:04.040 --> 3:46:07.040]  by design and are attempting to cause
[3:46:07.040 --> 3:46:11.040]  an economic and financial collapse worldwide.
[3:46:11.040 --> 3:46:12.040]  Now, ladies and gentlemen,
[3:46:12.040 --> 3:46:14.040]  storeable food has always been something
[3:46:14.040 --> 3:46:15.040]  that's important to have.
[3:46:15.040 --> 3:46:17.040]  It's a check box that everybody needs to have,
[3:46:17.040 --> 3:46:19.040]  taking care of, right along with water filtration,
[3:46:19.040 --> 3:46:22.040]  self-defense, and a relationship with God.
[3:46:22.040 --> 3:46:23.040]  But now, more than ever,
[3:46:23.040 --> 3:46:25.040]  you need to get your storeable food orders in.
[3:46:25.040 --> 3:46:27.040]  Now, we're ready to ship to you

[3:46:33.040 --> 3:46:34.040]  Because in the future,
[3:46:34.040 --> 3:46:36.040]  you're going to see more food supply shortages
[3:46:36.040 --> 3:46:38.040]  and you're going to see food supply
[3:46:38.040 --> 3:46:40.040]  price increases that are already taking place.
[3:46:40.040 --> 3:46:42.040]  So lock in your storeable food now
[3:46:42.040 --> 3:46:46.040]  at a lower price and fund the InfowarsStore.com.
[3:46:46.040 --> 3:46:48.040]  That's how you fight the great reset
[3:46:48.040 --> 3:46:51.040]  is by being self-sufficient and not under their control.
[3:46:51.040 --> 3:47:17.040]  So get prepared now at InfowarsStore.com.
[3:47:17.040 --> 3:47:23.040]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[3:47:23.040 --> 3:47:26.040]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show
[3:47:26.040 --> 3:47:32.040]  with Gerald Salente.
[3:47:32.040 --> 3:47:34.040]  Great being on The Alex Jones Show.
[3:47:34.040 --> 3:47:36.040]  Got cover of The Trends Journal.
[3:47:36.040 --> 3:47:39.040]  Silent night, holy night.
[3:47:39.040 --> 3:47:44.040]  All's not calm, all's not bright.
[3:47:44.040 --> 3:47:46.040]  And that's another Anthony Free to work on.
[3:47:46.040 --> 3:47:49.040]  If you look at it closely, those snowflakes,
[3:47:49.040 --> 3:47:57.040]  they got those little vaccine needles at the end.
[3:47:57.040 --> 3:48:00.040]  And it's not calm and it's not bright
[3:48:00.040 --> 3:48:03.040]  and you need to do what we need to do
[3:48:03.040 --> 3:48:05.040]  to keep everything right and support the truth
[3:48:05.040 --> 3:48:08.040]  and the facts and freedom.
[3:48:08.040 --> 3:48:12.040]  And you could do that by buying these great products
[3:48:12.040 --> 3:48:15.040]  on Infowars and this is the time to do it
[3:48:15.040 --> 3:48:18.040]  because it is Christmas time.
[3:48:18.040 --> 3:48:20.040]  And they had their super sale
[3:48:20.040 --> 3:48:22.040]  and you could save up to 40% off plus.
[3:48:22.040 --> 3:48:25.040]  And of course you get free shipping store-wide
[3:48:25.040 --> 3:48:28.040]  and being into the trip, man.
[3:48:28.040 --> 3:48:31.040]  You get your Patriot points doubled up.
[3:48:31.040 --> 3:48:33.040]  And so it's Christmas time
[3:48:33.040 --> 3:48:37.040]  and you got to defend the celebration of the holiday
[3:48:37.040 --> 3:48:39.040]  and support the Infowars crew
[3:48:39.040 --> 3:48:43.040]  because they're getting the gifts you need for yourself
[3:48:43.040 --> 3:48:45.040]  and your loved ones
[3:48:45.040 --> 3:48:50.040]  and letting me get them at rock bottom prices.
[3:48:50.040 --> 3:48:52.040]  So instead of buying any of your family
[3:48:52.040 --> 3:48:55.040]  some cheap gifts made in China,
[3:48:55.040 --> 3:49:00.040]  why not give them the gear, preparation supplies,
[3:49:00.040 --> 3:49:03.040]  or supplements they really want.
[3:49:03.040 --> 3:49:06.040]  And their powerhouse formulas are up to 60% off
[3:49:06.040 --> 3:49:08.040]  and the savings don't stop there.
[3:49:08.040 --> 3:49:11.040]  They're giving you free shipping store-wide
[3:49:11.040 --> 3:49:14.040]  and again, double Patriot points on all purchases.
[3:49:14.040 --> 3:49:17.040]  So shop now, here's just some of the products.
[3:49:17.040 --> 3:49:20.040]  You got the brain force, 50% off.
[3:49:20.040 --> 3:49:23.040]  Ultimate Krill Oil, Patriot Blend and Immune System support.
[3:49:23.040 --> 3:49:27.040]  Blend Black Coffee, coffee back, rather blend coffee back.
[3:49:27.040 --> 3:49:30.040]  And that's in stock, that's $2 off.
[3:49:30.040 --> 3:49:32.040]  Knockout sleep support.
[3:49:32.040 --> 3:49:34.040]  And you got to get knocked out to get some sleep
[3:49:34.040 --> 3:49:36.040]  when you're all uptight, man.
[3:49:36.040 --> 3:49:38.040]  And that's 50% off.
[3:49:38.040 --> 3:49:40.040]  Hair and beard support, 60% off.
[3:49:40.040 --> 3:49:41.040]  A whole bunch of things.
[3:49:41.040 --> 3:49:45.040]  1776 founding member, one ounce silver rounds
[3:49:45.040 --> 3:49:48.040]  and there's only a few hundred that remain.
[3:49:48.040 --> 3:49:51.040]  Alexa Pure Pro, it's back in stock.
[3:49:51.040 --> 3:49:53.040]  That's $30 off.
[3:49:53.040 --> 3:49:55.040]  And they got some of their fan-favorite products
[3:49:55.040 --> 3:49:57.040]  and these were flying off the shelves too.
[3:49:57.040 --> 3:50:00.040]  The Vitamin Mineral Oil Fusion, 40% off.
[3:50:00.040 --> 3:50:03.040]  Prostagod, you got to get that.
[3:50:03.040 --> 3:50:04.040]  50% off.
[3:50:04.040 --> 3:50:06.040]  Terabofors, 40% off.
[3:50:06.040 --> 3:50:10.040]  And your all-new Super Coral whitening toothpaste.
[3:50:10.040 --> 3:50:12.040]  It's only $9.95.
[3:50:12.040 --> 3:50:17.040]  Bodies, DNA Force Plus, down-and-out liquid sleep support.
[3:50:17.040 --> 3:50:22.040]  And my favorite, Super Male Vitality.
[3:50:22.040 --> 3:50:25.040]  And they got that Super Male, Female Vitality too.
[3:50:25.040 --> 3:50:27.040]  Each of these 50% off.
[3:50:27.040 --> 3:50:30.040]  Living Defense Plus, 50% off.
[3:50:30.040 --> 3:50:31.040]  Lung Cleanse.
[3:50:31.040 --> 3:50:34.040]  So again, don't go out to these big box stores
[3:50:34.040 --> 3:50:37.040]  where the people are slaves of slave landia
[3:50:37.040 --> 3:50:39.040]  in the big tech stores.
[3:50:39.040 --> 3:50:41.040]  Take your support where it counts
[3:50:41.040 --> 3:50:44.040]  and support the Info Wars crew
[3:50:44.040 --> 3:50:46.040]  and fight against tyranny
[3:50:46.040 --> 3:50:50.040]  by getting these great products for less.
[3:50:50.040 --> 3:50:53.040]  The Christmas Super Sale.
[3:50:53.040 --> 3:50:55.040]  And this is the time to do it.
[3:50:55.040 --> 3:50:59.040]  60% off reshipping, double-patriot points.
[3:50:59.040 --> 3:51:01.040]  The time is now.
[3:51:01.040 --> 3:51:04.040]  And again, what we're going through now is,
[3:51:04.040 --> 3:51:06.040]  I've been at this for 42 years.
[3:51:06.040 --> 3:51:08.040]  I've been trend forecasting.
[3:51:08.040 --> 3:51:10.040]  You know, I don't know if you saw some of my books,
[3:51:10.040 --> 3:51:15.040]  Trend Tracking, International Best Seller,
[3:51:15.040 --> 3:51:17.040]  Trend Tracking,
[3:51:17.040 --> 3:51:20.040]  a lot better than Megatrend's Time magazine
[3:51:20.040 --> 3:51:23.040]  back in the day.
[3:51:23.040 --> 3:51:28.040]  The magazine, this week, was only 147 pages.
[3:51:28.040 --> 3:51:31.040]  147 pages.
[3:51:31.040 --> 3:51:33.040]  A weekly. No ads.
[3:51:33.040 --> 3:51:35.040]  No photo.
[3:51:35.040 --> 3:51:39.040]  You know you pay for the Wall Street Journal every day?
[3:51:39.040 --> 3:51:41.040]  $5.
[3:51:41.040 --> 3:51:45.040]  $5 a day.
[3:51:45.040 --> 3:51:49.040]  We're giving you a weekly magazine
[3:51:49.040 --> 3:51:52.040]  for $2 a week.
[3:51:52.040 --> 3:51:55.040]  And we give every ounce of energy that we have
[3:51:55.040 --> 3:51:58.040]  to make it the best magazine in the world.
[3:51:58.040 --> 3:52:00.040]  Nothing comes close to it anywhere, any place.
[3:52:00.040 --> 3:52:03.040]  If anybody could show me, please send it to me.
[3:52:03.040 --> 3:52:06.040]  So support us as well.
[3:52:06.040 --> 3:52:09.040]  United We Stand divided We Fall.
[3:52:09.040 --> 3:52:13.040]  You go to TrendsJournal.com, TrendsJournal.com.
[3:52:13.040 --> 3:52:15.040]  It's the only place in the world
[3:52:15.040 --> 3:52:17.040]  where you're going to read history before it happens.
[3:52:17.040 --> 3:52:19.040]  The trends are there. You could read them.
[3:52:19.040 --> 3:52:22.040]  Again, this inflation stuff,
[3:52:22.040 --> 3:52:25.040]  it's saying it was going to happen and what the implications are going to be.
[3:52:25.040 --> 3:52:28.040]  And we're going next year.
[3:52:28.040 --> 3:52:31.040]  And there's going to be opportunities too.
[3:52:31.040 --> 3:52:33.040]  Yep, here it is.
[3:52:33.040 --> 3:52:35.040]  Silent night.
[3:52:35.040 --> 3:52:39.040]  All's not calm and all's not bright.
[3:52:39.040 --> 3:52:44.040]  Anyway, look at that artwork by Frieda, the guys are genius.
[3:52:44.040 --> 3:52:46.040]  Anyway.
[3:52:46.040 --> 3:52:48.040]  And also,
[3:52:48.040 --> 3:52:52.040]  go to FreedomPeaceJustice.com,
[3:52:52.040 --> 3:52:55.040]  FreedomPeaceJustice.com.
[3:52:55.040 --> 3:52:59.040]  And that's the church, the universal church of freedom, peace and justice.
[3:52:59.040 --> 3:53:02.040]  And people that sign up to become members
[3:53:02.040 --> 3:53:05.040]  that need an employer
[3:53:05.040 --> 3:53:08.040]  or a government
[3:53:08.040 --> 3:53:11.040]  religious vaccine exemption.
[3:53:11.040 --> 3:53:13.040]  Ours is the top.
[3:53:13.040 --> 3:53:16.040]  And you can see the comments.
[3:53:16.040 --> 3:53:20.040]  Again, the only work if your employer
[3:53:20.040 --> 3:53:24.040]  accepts a religious vaccine exemption
[3:53:24.040 --> 3:53:26.040]  or if your government,
[3:53:26.040 --> 3:53:30.040]  and it's global, we have one for the United States and a global one.
[3:53:30.040 --> 3:53:34.040]  So we're uniting people of all races, colors and creeds
[3:53:34.040 --> 3:53:37.040]  to live heaven on earth that they've stolen from us.
[3:53:37.040 --> 3:53:40.040]  So going back to the markets
[3:53:40.040 --> 3:53:42.040]  and what's coming down.
[3:53:42.040 --> 3:53:44.040]  Inflation is real.
[3:53:44.040 --> 3:53:47.040]  These super sales that you're getting in Christmas
[3:53:47.040 --> 3:53:49.040]  from Alex Jones,
[3:53:49.040 --> 3:53:53.040]  they're giving you everything they can
[3:53:53.040 --> 3:53:55.040]  and get it back to them.
[3:53:55.040 --> 3:53:57.040]  The prices are right
[3:53:57.040 --> 3:53:59.040]  because inflation is skyrocketing
[3:53:59.040 --> 3:54:01.040]  and what you're paying for this stuff
[3:54:01.040 --> 3:54:04.040]  and what we're charging for the magazine is nothing.
[3:54:04.040 --> 3:54:08.040]  And I'm going to tell you why this thing is going to get a lot worse.
[3:54:08.040 --> 3:54:11.040]  You heard what just happened yesterday was the news.
[3:54:11.040 --> 3:54:16.040]  Colleges go back to drawing board again
[3:54:16.040 --> 3:54:18.040]  to fight COVID-19.
[3:54:18.040 --> 3:54:20.040]  That's from the Associated Press.
[3:54:20.040 --> 3:54:25.040]  Colleges go back to drawing board again to fight COVID.
[3:54:25.040 --> 3:54:28.040]  Going back to the drawing board,
[3:54:28.040 --> 3:54:31.040]  you mean you're making this crap up.
[3:54:31.040 --> 3:54:36.040]  You're a bunch of ignorant jerks making crap up.
[3:54:36.040 --> 3:54:40.040]  Like when you go in a restaurant, you got to wear a mask.
[3:54:40.040 --> 3:54:43.040]  But when you sit down, you can eat because the virus doesn't go to table then.
[3:54:43.040 --> 3:54:45.040]  When you're on airplane, you can eat and drink
[3:54:45.040 --> 3:54:47.040]  and you can do without the mask on.
[3:54:47.040 --> 3:54:49.040]  But put the mask on after you eat and drink
[3:54:49.040 --> 3:54:51.040]  because that's when the virus will get you.
[3:54:51.040 --> 3:54:55.040]  So now you got these colleges going back to the drawing board again
[3:54:55.040 --> 3:54:57.040]  to fight COVID.
[3:54:57.040 --> 3:54:59.040]  They're making up new crap.
[3:54:59.040 --> 3:55:01.040]  But here's the deal.
[3:55:01.040 --> 3:55:03.040]  Again, this isn't a conspiracy theory.
[3:55:03.040 --> 3:55:06.040]  This is Associated Press.
[3:55:06.040 --> 3:55:09.040]  It is obviously extremely dispiriting
[3:55:09.040 --> 3:55:11.040]  to have to take these steps.
[3:55:11.040 --> 3:55:17.040]  And this is the person that's the President Marta Pollock
[3:55:17.040 --> 3:55:19.040]  of Cornell University.
[3:55:19.040 --> 3:55:22.040]  Tuesday to move final exams online
[3:55:22.040 --> 3:55:27.040]  after more than 700 students tested positive
[3:55:27.040 --> 3:55:29.040]  over three days.
[3:55:29.040 --> 3:55:33.040]  So they're testing these kids all the time, right?
[3:55:33.040 --> 3:55:36.040]  You know what the vaccination rate is?
[3:55:36.040 --> 3:55:39.040]  98 percent.
[3:55:39.040 --> 3:55:42.040]  98 percent.
[3:55:42.040 --> 3:55:43.040]  98, what happened?
[3:55:43.040 --> 3:55:45.040]  Heard immunity.
[3:55:45.040 --> 3:55:47.040]  I heard that before.
[3:55:47.040 --> 3:55:48.040]  Yeah.
[3:55:48.040 --> 3:55:55.040]  That mouth freak Fauci was shooting that out of his effing Fauci mouth.
[3:55:55.040 --> 3:55:58.040]  70 percent.
[3:55:58.040 --> 3:56:00.040]  Oh, then he upped it to 75.
[3:56:00.040 --> 3:56:02.040]  Hey, wait a minute.
[3:56:02.040 --> 3:56:06.040]  98 percent.
[3:56:06.040 --> 3:56:10.040]  Cornell, Princeton, and NYU all reported
[3:56:10.040 --> 3:56:15.040]  student vaccination rates of more than 98 percent.
[3:56:15.040 --> 3:56:19.040]  And they're all locking down.
[3:56:19.040 --> 3:56:21.040]  Yep.
[3:56:21.040 --> 3:56:24.040]  They're making it up.
[3:56:24.040 --> 3:56:28.040]  Many colleges are planning for potential disruption next semester,
[3:56:28.040 --> 3:56:33.040]  even as they contend without breaks now.
[3:56:33.040 --> 3:56:36.040]  University of Massachusetts in Amherst was among the first
[3:56:36.040 --> 3:56:38.040]  to require the booster for students,
[3:56:38.040 --> 3:56:41.040]  saying all students must get shots
[3:56:41.040 --> 3:56:46.040]  unless they have medical or religious exemptions.
[3:56:46.040 --> 3:56:48.040]  You want those religious exemptions?
[3:56:48.040 --> 3:56:52.040]  You could go to freedompeacejustice.com.
[3:56:52.040 --> 3:56:57.040]  And again, what they do is they call these schools liberal.
[3:56:57.040 --> 3:57:00.040]  They are misusing the term for liberal.
[3:57:00.040 --> 3:57:02.040]  Everybody's doing it.
[3:57:02.040 --> 3:57:06.040]  A liberal is willing to respect or accept behavior
[3:57:06.040 --> 3:57:08.040]  or opinions different from one's own,
[3:57:08.040 --> 3:57:10.040]  open to new ideas.
[3:57:10.040 --> 3:57:12.040]  These kids are all freaked out
[3:57:12.040 --> 3:57:18.040]  because you've got a bunch of freaks that are running the show.
[3:57:18.040 --> 3:57:21.040]  So again, we're heading into the new year.
[3:57:21.040 --> 3:57:26.040]  We're putting out the top trends for 2022.
[3:57:26.040 --> 3:57:29.040]  You better watch out.
[3:57:29.040 --> 3:57:32.040]  You better not cry.
[3:57:32.040 --> 3:57:35.040]  Santa Claus ain't coming to town.
[3:57:35.040 --> 3:57:38.040]  So do what you can to support InfoWars,
[3:57:38.040 --> 3:57:43.040]  trendsjournal.com and freedompeacejustice.com.
[3:57:43.040 --> 3:57:44.040]  Bye-bye.
[3:57:44.040 --> 3:57:45.040]  So this could be...
[3:57:45.040 --> 3:57:47.040]  I never compromise the quality of ingredients
[3:57:47.040 --> 3:57:49.040]  we put in InfoWars live products.
[3:57:49.040 --> 3:57:51.040]  And that's why for more than two years,
[3:57:51.040 --> 3:57:53.040]  we've been sold out of Ultimate Bone Broth.
[3:57:53.040 --> 3:57:56.040]  We could never get the ingredients again until now.
[3:57:56.040 --> 3:57:59.040]  And we have reformulated and not just used the same ingredients.
[3:57:59.040 --> 3:58:02.040]  We've boosted it and made them even stronger.
[3:58:02.040 --> 3:58:04.040]  So out of all the bone broths out there,
[3:58:04.040 --> 3:58:06.040]  I'm telling you this is next level.
[3:58:06.040 --> 3:58:07.040]  Listen to what it's got in it.
