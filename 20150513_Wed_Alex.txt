[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:20.800]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.800 --> 00:30.680]  it's already Wednesday the 13th day of May 2015 we don't have any guests today but
[00:30.680 --> 00:34.920]  we have a ton of vital special reports that we're going to be premiering here
[00:34.920 --> 00:40.120]  on the radio TV transmission we're going to be taking your phone calls we're
[00:40.120 --> 00:43.880]  going to be going over just the progression of globalist operations
[00:43.880 --> 00:49.000]  where they're making major strides against free humanity and basic liberty
[00:49.000 --> 00:55.240]  and security where we're holding them back and where we're having victories but
[00:55.240 --> 01:00.840]  it is a full-on war continually and I've got to go through all this news today
[01:00.840 --> 01:07.280]  because there is just so much happening I've been so busy I didn't air the ABCC
[01:07.280 --> 01:15.480]  CBS NBC Fox News CNN MSNBC clips the last two or three days attacking this radio
[01:15.480 --> 01:22.040]  host this info wars comm operation with their deception but I will air some of
[01:22.040 --> 01:27.240]  those like the foxes the five and then compare that to what's really going on
[01:27.240 --> 01:34.720]  they're freaked out that Ted Cruz and Congressman Gohmert and Governor Abbott
[01:34.720 --> 01:41.460]  and Chuck Norris and so many other people are concerned about military
[01:41.460 --> 01:47.160]  operations in the US and it's because in the last six seven years as the
[01:47.160 --> 01:50.760]  military publicly began training to take on veterans gun owners
[01:50.760 --> 01:57.360]  conservatives libertarians Christians folks didn't believe me at first but
[01:57.360 --> 02:01.520]  they went and read the documents at army dot mill and at the army war college
[02:01.520 --> 02:08.400]  and they saw training in their cities and towns and they see the movies and
[02:08.400 --> 02:12.480]  TV and entertainment branding the next war as domestic against the Patriots
[02:12.480 --> 02:16.520]  this is the final mop-up operation they just want to shut all this up and not
[02:16.520 --> 02:19.680]  have a debate about it so they want to just keep saying it doesn't exist like
[02:19.680 --> 02:24.800]  NSA spying or open borders or the rest of it they want to play that game so we
[02:24.800 --> 02:29.160]  never have a debate about hey do we want preparations for martial law and why
[02:29.160 --> 02:33.360]  are they being made they then change the subject in line and say that we say
[02:33.360 --> 02:37.320]  martial law is imminent when in truth under the executive orders that are
[02:37.320 --> 02:42.320]  already in place we're under martial law they had just haven't implemented all
[02:42.320 --> 02:53.440]  of it but the the heats on now I could kick myself because I already knew all
[02:53.440 --> 02:57.080]  this and I just get up here on air and we write articles and do films and show
[02:57.080 --> 02:59.920]  you news articles where they admit they're trying to take on the tea party
[02:59.920 --> 03:04.560]  and veterans and things like that but I didn't get into reports that we wrote
[03:04.560 --> 03:09.360]  about in fact guys if you just take these terms of the crew in there I forgot
[03:09.360 --> 03:14.920]  to tell you this type them into the NSA search engine Google and then at info
[03:14.920 --> 03:19.800]  wars.com out to the end you'll find articles that we wrote in 2012 when
[03:19.800 --> 03:24.800]  this was said at a major Pentagon conference that much of which was
[03:24.800 --> 03:30.360]  televised on c-span and they said conus will be dominated we will master the
[03:30.360 --> 03:35.000]  human domain we've played some of these clips domestically and we're gonna roll
[03:35.000 --> 03:39.840]  out troops on the streets as part of brigade homeland and when we're done
[03:39.840 --> 03:45.560]  we're gonna have rotated jobs out of the last batch of military recruits that
[03:45.560 --> 03:50.520]  have now served three to five years we will have 400 plus thousand domestic
[03:50.520 --> 03:57.280]  troops on the streets of America that was in the news in 2012 and I was reading
[03:57.280 --> 04:04.600]  an article at info wars.com today by Daniel Taylor and it was quoting these
[04:04.600 --> 04:09.320]  generals and then linking to where they said it document Jade Helm commander
[04:09.320 --> 04:15.000]  plans to operationalize the conus base now that's today the guys just googled
[04:15.000 --> 04:18.520]  what I said you found an article that we wrote a couple years ago let's pull it
[04:18.520 --> 04:22.920]  up good job finding it that fast document well that's another article you
[04:22.920 --> 04:28.480]  get one before that army manual lines plan to kill rioters demonstrators in
[04:28.480 --> 04:32.680]  America yeah that's two thousand well thank you print that for me because now
[04:32.680 --> 04:36.480]  one of our auxiliary rioters has dug up the same thing but it's kind of a
[04:36.480 --> 04:41.760]  nightmare where I keep rediscovering stuff I'd forgotten now this is all
[04:41.760 --> 04:46.240]  important because it's all public army documents how they're gonna mow us down
[04:46.240 --> 04:54.280]  and kill us but when you go past that we now have new video from two days ago
[04:54.280 --> 05:00.040]  where the military trained to confiscate guns Daimler trucks has obtained a
[05:00.040 --> 05:04.480]  permit from the Nevada DMV to operate the first licensed autonomous truck on

[05:26.480 --> 05:30.720]  September well maybe Google wasn't at fault but I wouldn't be a passenger in
[05:30.720 --> 05:35.320]  a car with a driver who had had three accidents in eight months and while they
[05:35.320 --> 05:39.840]  tell us their cars were not at fault California DMV said it's not able to
[05:39.840 --> 05:43.680]  release details of the accidents you know kind of like the secret trade
[05:43.680 --> 05:47.920]  agreements are being negotiated we're not allowed to see the details and all
[05:47.920 --> 05:52.560]  the while they'll be touting how their cars programmed by people are always

[09:17.960 --> 09:21.080]  belong to their families and recognize the kids belong to whole communities if
[09:21.080 --> 09:25.880]  you've got a business that you didn't build that somebody else made that

[10:43.320 --> 10:59.440]  it's Alex Jones
[10:59.440 --> 11:04.680]  the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will
[11:04.680 --> 11:16.520]  persist America is being captured right now the Republic is on its knees its
[11:16.520 --> 11:21.360]  borders have been dissolved we have been signed on to half of the global 2.2
[11:21.360 --> 11:28.520]  quadrillion fraudulent debt the debt we actually owe is over a hundred trillion
[11:28.520 --> 11:36.840]  dollars that we've been maneuvered into every day I get up for about two hours
[11:36.840 --> 11:43.200]  and look at info wars.com news alone and I go over to drudge and I go over to
[11:43.200 --> 11:47.240]  CNBC and I go to the London Guardian I mean I go to a lot of publications but
[11:47.240 --> 11:57.360]  it's just twilight zone I was thinking today there are headlines about free
[11:57.360 --> 12:03.400]  speech to be banned in England if you even criticize gays or Muslims you'll
[12:03.400 --> 12:09.040]  just be arrested they're actually trying to pass a law but we always warned of
[12:09.040 --> 12:14.560]  and then articles about forced inoculations going on all over the
[12:14.560 --> 12:23.680]  western world even though there's not a law in place and just the most bizarre
[12:23.680 --> 12:34.920]  tyrannical things you can imagine unfolding it makes your head spin and
[12:34.920 --> 12:38.200]  announcements by the Democrats that they want to regulate the internet and free
[12:38.200 --> 12:43.800]  speech as we warn you they would do and the Republican leadership being part of
[12:43.800 --> 12:53.120]  it but then at the same time there's a lot of good news that I see every day and
[12:53.120 --> 12:58.240]  the reason the power structure is coming down with both feet right now
[12:58.240 --> 13:07.520]  worldwide the reason the establishment is on a warpath is an attempt to keep us
[13:07.520 --> 13:11.480]  all on the reservation on the plantation because they know there's a slave
[13:11.480 --> 13:16.800]  revolt happening these western governments on average have less than
[13:16.800 --> 13:28.320]  10% approval ratings Congress has an 8% so they are illegitimate and if you look
[13:28.320 --> 13:34.040]  at the tyrannical moves with executive power grabs and foreign corporate boards
[13:34.040 --> 13:39.560]  being given governmental power and selective business enforcement to shut
[13:39.560 --> 13:46.720]  down the establishment's competition in every sector from communications to
[13:46.720 --> 13:53.840]  energy from textiles to transportation it's on there is a orgy of
[13:53.840 --> 13:59.880]  consolidation there are over what is it a thousand billionaires now and they're
[13:59.880 --> 14:06.720]  making new ones every week or so because the select elite nine times out of ten
[14:06.720 --> 14:12.000]  are the new billionaires who are given the inside contracts given the inside
[14:12.000 --> 14:17.640]  new technologies that are developed given the only access to markets given
[14:17.640 --> 14:21.760]  the access to IMF World Bank XM International Bank of Settlements money
[14:21.760 --> 14:29.240]  and given the unlimited QE worldwide not just our currency being devalued but a
[14:29.240 --> 14:35.680]  five-year race to devalue currencies with the elites getting free trillions to buy
[14:35.680 --> 14:45.760]  up every water district every mining district every infrastructure every
[14:45.760 --> 14:51.800]  bridge every school it's not privatization it's private groups that
[14:51.800 --> 14:55.320]  have hijacked the government giving themselves government power and then
[14:55.320 --> 15:01.320]  saying everything they do secret and you can't see it and then of course we're
[15:01.320 --> 15:06.280]  going to have paramilitarized police and in cameras and NSA spine of course we're
[15:06.280 --> 15:11.360]  going to have armored vehicles on the streets because we're going into law of
[15:11.360 --> 15:17.240]  the jungle here because when you create consolidated combines it kills
[15:17.240 --> 15:22.440]  productivity and guess what they have built that into their philosophy that
[15:22.440 --> 15:26.480]  it's good to have us poor good to have us with nothing Africans can't have
[15:26.480 --> 15:31.280]  air conditioning or cars or a nice house Obama says while having the biggest
[15:31.280 --> 15:36.840]  carbon footprint in the world that's the same thing for the West and they sell
[15:36.840 --> 15:44.840]  feudalism and serfdom and squalor and bondage and not having society progress
[15:44.840 --> 15:51.040]  as progressive everything with them is an inversion of what the word means the
[15:51.040 --> 15:56.640]  Patriot Act is the opposite of being a patriot the new freedom initiative to
[15:56.640 --> 16:00.160]  force drug half of America school children that was the goal is the
[16:00.160 --> 16:10.600]  opposite of new freedom it's the inverse the good news is every day I see
[16:10.600 --> 16:15.040]  very exciting things another major nation has just banned glyphosate I'm
[16:15.040 --> 16:21.680]  seeing a major country banned glyphosate every two to three days now we'll get to
[16:21.680 --> 16:29.440]  that every day major companies many of them fortune 500 say no more GMO no more
[16:29.440 --> 16:36.280]  artificial flavors chemicals no more bovine growth hormone it is beautiful
[16:36.280 --> 16:44.920]  what's happening so the truth is there is a cresting awakening happening but
[16:44.920 --> 16:49.740]  they know if it crest again the next wave is going to be so big it's going to
[16:49.740 --> 16:54.240]  be a renaissance that is taking us to the stars but then this tiny elite
[16:54.240 --> 16:59.560]  doesn't get to control human development and they crave control they'd rather
[16:59.560 --> 17:09.280]  stifle and stunt human society so that it's their little twisted bonsai instead
[17:09.280 --> 17:17.520]  of a giant forest that's what's really happening right now is they're battling
[17:17.520 --> 17:22.080]  to hold back progress they're battling to dumb down our species they're battling
[17:22.080 --> 17:26.640]  to make us in fight this morning I was at the gym and there was three TVs in
[17:26.640 --> 17:34.000]  front of me and one of them was Fox News the other was CBS and the other was MSNBC
[17:34.000 --> 17:40.320]  and I was watching Wounded Warrior ads on one channel with arms and legs
[17:40.320 --> 17:44.480]  blown off and on the other I was watching CBS for like 30 minutes on the
[17:44.480 --> 17:49.600]  elliptical I was just watching the subtitles and it was all about three
[17:49.600 --> 17:54.040]  stories in a row how men are hurting women in Hollywood and when women can't
[17:54.040 --> 17:58.440]  get the jobs or be behind the lens and be directors on and on and on and it was
[17:58.440 --> 18:02.640]  all just teaching us how to fight with each other and to see problems as the
[18:02.640 --> 18:07.760]  other gender divide and conquer and I was watching MSNBC and it was all how
[18:07.760 --> 18:12.520]  whites are suppressing blacks and suppressing trans trainees or whatever
[18:12.520 --> 18:17.320]  just just in fight in fight in fight in fight while we're being conquered by AI
[18:17.320 --> 18:21.520]  supercomputers the globalist control that are now rigging the entire global
[18:21.520 --> 18:25.840]  economy and setting up systems where it's impossible to survive or live
[18:25.840 --> 18:29.520]  unless you're inside the system and then inside the system you'll have to have
[18:29.520 --> 18:32.800]  forced inoculations and all the rest of it if you're going to be part of the new
[18:32.800 --> 18:39.240]  welfare program I mean we're watching the end of humanity as we know it the
[18:39.240 --> 18:45.120]  good news is there's been a giant uproar on why can't the public see the TPP
[18:45.120 --> 18:50.200]  why can only select senators see it and the pieces we've seen that have been
[18:50.200 --> 18:56.720]  leaked come after the Second Amendment come after our jobs force us to eat GMO
[18:56.720 --> 19:00.880]  don't let you label the food ends internet freedom I mean the little pieces
[19:00.880 --> 19:07.200]  we've got it's totally totalitarian which totalitarian that's a double
[19:07.200 --> 19:12.120]  underline because totalitarian means total tyranny but it is total
[19:12.120 --> 19:18.360]  totalitarianism good news RT you just gotta go RT to hear news like this

[24:49.080 --> 24:54.520]  Mondays or Fridays from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central. So the world is watching.
[24:54.520 --> 25:02.800]  Newspapers from Russia to Japan, South Africa, the UK, Europe, Mexico, Chile, the
[25:02.800 --> 25:10.120]  United States, upwards of 200 to 500 a day saying there is no plan for military
[25:10.120 --> 25:15.440]  domestic operations. It does not exist and misrepresenting everything we say
[25:15.440 --> 25:21.120]  and do. But they're freaking out because constitutionalist, Republican
[25:21.120 --> 25:25.840]  leadership, the main enemy of the globalists from all the high-powered
[25:25.840 --> 25:31.040]  Republican and Democratic meetings that leak in the news, they are afraid of a
[25:31.040 --> 25:35.520]  Tea Party takeover of the Republican Party and the Republican Democratic
[25:35.520 --> 25:40.560]  donors are combining forces. The National Chamber of Commerce with the
[25:40.560 --> 25:46.360]  Democrats to break America's back once and for all. Just like the Republican
[25:46.360 --> 25:54.040]  leadership is working with the Democrats to force through TPP and saying it's
[25:54.040 --> 25:58.480]  normal. You're not allowed to read it. It's a secret board with the Communist
[25:58.480 --> 26:02.680]  Chinese government heading it is going to make more rules than Congress. Sit down
[26:02.680 --> 26:12.120]  and shut up. But it doesn't fly. The dog doesn't hunt. People understand now that
[26:12.120 --> 26:16.480]  outside of law, Texas in seven years has had half our power plants turned off.
[26:16.480 --> 26:23.240]  Do you understand how much that hurt our state? Everybody I know, even rich
[26:23.240 --> 26:26.840]  people are hurt by the expensive electricity. We should have cheap
[26:26.840 --> 26:32.000]  electricity here. In fact, I looked it up online because I've been paying online
[26:32.000 --> 26:37.600]  for about 10 years for a power. I had a bigger house seven years ago. I mean much
[26:37.600 --> 26:45.400]  bigger. And my power bill was $300 less than it is now in a much larger house.
[26:45.400 --> 26:51.800]  And everyone I know says their power bill has doubled. They shut down the four
[26:51.800 --> 26:57.200]  city-owned high-quality clean power plants. And I know I rant on this and
[26:57.200 --> 27:04.840]  people say why is he so obsessed? In war you turn off the enemy's power. We're
[27:04.840 --> 27:14.320]  having our power turned off. You know like in 2001 Space Odyssey where he's
[27:14.320 --> 27:19.600]  turning off the power to each cell of the computer. I'm afraid, Dave, I'm afraid.
[27:19.600 --> 27:28.880]  They're turning America off. I'm watching them turn it off, in front of me. And then
[27:28.880 --> 27:31.920]  they take all the power and all the money and all the energy and give it to
[27:31.920 --> 27:37.120]  themselves and just mass this evil against us and launch wars against Russia
[27:37.120 --> 27:40.800]  and turn al-Qaeda loose in the Middle East. And then they're shutting down our
[27:40.800 --> 27:45.840]  energy sources. I'm gonna cover the military news when I come back. It is so
[27:45.840 --> 27:51.120]  over-the-top that I can't even get into it. I don't know how to explain it. The
[27:51.120 --> 27:56.600]  most over-the-top sensational stuff I don't feel worthy to even cover. And I
[27:56.600 --> 28:03.520]  talked about this at the start of the show. 6 30 this morning. I get up, I go in,
[28:03.520 --> 28:08.400]  I'm looking at infowars.com and I go I know Paul Watson. He publishes at about
[28:08.400 --> 28:15.560]  6 30. He hasn't published yet. I bet he publishes in one minute. I go over, make
[28:15.560 --> 28:25.200]  coffee. Walk back over two minutes later. Hit refresh. Boom. There's the article.
[28:25.200 --> 28:29.280]  And I read the article and I already know everything in the article but it
[28:29.280 --> 28:33.400]  makes me sick that I'm so right. And it makes me sick that these traders and
[28:33.400 --> 28:37.920]  media know they're lying about us as the country is prepared to be completely
[28:37.920 --> 28:42.000]  taken down. And then I read another article about 30 minutes later that goes
[28:42.000 --> 28:49.040]  up and I get really upset. And do you know why I got upset? I knew every word in
[28:49.040 --> 28:53.360]  the article. In fact, when you guys print me the article I ask you to pull up if you
[28:53.360 --> 29:04.600]  Google that term. The headline is Army Trains to Kill Demonstrators. And it goes
[29:04.600 --> 29:13.880]  back to the Army document 2012 and mentions Northcom and domestic control
[29:13.880 --> 29:18.360]  of everything we do and surveilling everyone. Army manual outlines plan to
[29:18.360 --> 29:23.280]  kill rioters, demonstrators in America. But in that it mentions the document
[29:23.280 --> 29:29.320]  that's in the new article today. Document Jade Helm Commander plans to
[29:29.320 --> 29:38.480]  operationalize the Conus base for the contiguous US, the continental US. And
[29:38.480 --> 29:44.560]  it's all right here that yes, Jade Helm is run and is a domestic takeover plan.
[29:44.560 --> 29:47.920]  That's why they're freaking out so much. And there's more when we come back.
[29:47.920 --> 29:54.320]  Gun confiscation drills with the police. They're preparing. And people say well
[29:54.320 --> 30:00.200]  start a civil war. That's the plan. That's the plan. France has finally launched
[30:00.200 --> 30:04.640]  a criminal inquiry into alleged sex abuse of children by French UN soldiers.
[30:04.640 --> 30:08.600]  French authorities were notified nine months ago by a UN whistleblower,
[30:08.600 --> 30:13.640]  Anders Compass, of the rape and sodomy of at least 10 starving and homeless boys,
[30:13.640 --> 30:18.720]  some as young as nine, over a period of seven months in the Central African
[30:18.720 --> 30:23.480]  Republic. UN Secretary General Ban Kei Moon was far more upset about the leak
[30:23.480 --> 30:27.640]  of the information than he was about the crime, calling it a serious breach of
[30:27.640 --> 30:31.680]  protocol. And he took immediate action against the whistleblower, not against the
[30:31.680 --> 30:36.840]  UN sexual predators. This is far from an isolated incidence of UN troops
[30:36.840 --> 30:40.600]  preying on civilians they were sent to protect and having the UN cover up their
[30:40.600 --> 30:45.800]  crimes. Identical atrocities committed by UN soldiers in Haiti surfaced just three
[30:45.800 --> 30:49.360]  months ago and it's happened in virtually every country UN peacekeepers
[30:49.360 --> 30:55.080]  occupy. Yet neither soldiers nor the UN have ever been held accountable. This is

[33:32.200 --> 33:41.520]  focus myself and as best I can give you a presentation on exactly what's going
[33:41.520 --> 33:50.800]  on with Jade Helm and before I do that I'm gonna be very honest with you I say
[33:50.800 --> 33:59.160]  I don't let enemy propaganda get to me but when I'm right I'm right and I just
[33:59.160 --> 34:04.080]  need to engage in leadership and not even sit here and defend what we're
[34:04.080 --> 34:10.600]  saying but just lay it out more and more I need to come in here on the big TV
[34:10.600 --> 34:17.840]  screens behind me if you're a TV viewer and just like a professor walk through
[34:17.840 --> 34:21.960]  with exhibits exactly what's happening and just not even address the
[34:21.960 --> 34:28.280]  propagandists because they just want us to address them and change the subject
[34:28.280 --> 34:36.600]  about making this a debate it is nauseating head spinning how many
[34:36.600 --> 34:43.440]  thousands of white papers and books and statements and c-span hearings and
[34:43.440 --> 34:48.480]  defense department briefings that are online at the defense department's
[34:48.480 --> 34:53.520]  websites so much of this stuff that I can't even consciously remember 5% of
[34:53.520 --> 34:58.120]  it and then I'll be doing research on what's currently happening and then
[34:58.120 --> 35:02.200]  just go back over the same research we've had for years I'm like well I
[35:02.200 --> 35:06.280]  forgot they had the admission of the civilian inmate labor camp program and
[35:06.280 --> 35:09.240]  how they're going to break up our families and processes with social
[35:09.240 --> 35:13.880]  security numbers and put us into forced work brigades I mean that's on army dot
[35:13.880 --> 35:21.200]  mill or how they admit domestic total conus domination to take out empowered
[35:21.200 --> 35:26.120]  individuals who are politically motivated and leading others it describes
[35:26.120 --> 35:32.720]  shutting down peaceful citizen activity taking over the states and that's just in
[35:32.720 --> 35:39.760]  one army document for conus under the meeting titled mastering the human
[35:39.760 --> 35:45.840]  domain 2012 and I was mentioning this last week we did special reports with
[35:45.840 --> 35:52.440]  David Knight and others on it on Monday and Rob do and then our listeners and
[35:52.440 --> 35:58.960]  other writers went and dug in and went yeah the commander of Jade Helm had
[35:58.960 --> 36:04.040]  press briefings and in the manuals is the preparation to take on the American
[36:04.040 --> 36:13.320]  people yes yes yes that article master the human domain the domestic plan for
[36:13.320 --> 36:18.280]  Jade Helm Pentagon goal of information domination hidden in plain sight it's
[36:18.280 --> 36:22.560]  taken over the local newspapers the local towns I mean it is designed for full
[36:22.560 --> 36:28.640]  nationwide occupation that'll make the reconstruction in the south look
[36:28.640 --> 36:35.560]  like a primitive operation compared to this now obviously it was a primitive
[36:35.560 --> 36:41.560]  operation it was in the 18 late 1860s 1870s
[36:50.000 --> 36:53.840]  and yes I'll get into the whole commuter train situation and the rest of it
[36:53.840 --> 36:56.680]  they're saying it might be terrorism another commuter train was hit by a
[36:56.680 --> 37:00.600]  projectile before it's crashed let me tell you at nine times out of ten in
[37:00.600 --> 37:04.720]  fact more than that probably 95% of the time when you hear about passenger G
[37:04.720 --> 37:12.560]  realm it's or or or regular trains that are carrying freight crashing they haven't
[37:12.560 --> 37:19.600]  updated in about 50 60 years the rail beds in this country you used to when my
[37:19.600 --> 37:25.600]  dad was a child and his mother was getting her master's degree in Houston
[37:25.600 --> 37:31.600]  my grandmother they would get on the train in Tig Texas they drop her off in
[37:31.600 --> 37:36.840]  the morning and it would bullet train at over about a hundred and five miles an
[37:36.840 --> 37:45.200]  hour this is like a 1955 my dad's about five years old to Houston on that very
[37:45.200 --> 37:50.680]  same stretch of line was a small particular Union on railroad I know
[37:50.680 --> 37:55.160]  because my grandfather's grandfather ran it the point was is that my dad worked
[37:55.160 --> 37:58.920]  for the railroad I that's why I know about railroad stuff
[37:59.800 --> 38:06.320]  you can't make freight go over 45 miles an hour on that very railroad today
[38:06.320 --> 38:17.520]  105 miles an hour was the safe speed in 1955 now you can't go half that basically
[38:18.480 --> 38:23.800]  that's why the trains are flying off the tracks they are pieces of junk when
[38:23.800 --> 38:27.160]  you're on New York subways and they're flying around and it's jumping up and
[38:27.160 --> 38:34.360]  down it's rotting but nothing compared to the general rail lines show what else
[38:34.360 --> 38:41.880]  is there to know the railroads are basically the worst in the world we
[38:41.880 --> 38:51.400]  have Mexican trains get up to 75 miles an hour and they've got bad railroads six
[38:51.400 --> 38:56.200]  dead hundreds injured after Amtrak train derails in Philadelphia yeah I won't get
[38:56.200 --> 39:00.360]  near an Amtrak and I'll tell you why horrible government service check
[39:00.360 --> 39:03.280]  points they'll steal the money out of your bag claiming it's drug money even
[39:03.280 --> 39:07.280]  $500 that's in the news today and you don't get anywhere as you're going 45
[39:07.280 --> 39:14.920]  50 miles an hour and they'll speed up to 60 70 man you it is a death trap a death
[39:14.920 --> 39:23.800]  trap there it is DEA take 16,000 train passenger because it can any crash any
[39:23.800 --> 39:29.560]  cash is inherently suspicious and can be deemed guilty close quote by the
[39:29.560 --> 39:33.320]  seizing agency with no cooperating evidence or no hearing no judge no
[39:33.320 --> 39:37.480]  nothing I mean this country is so far gone it'll make your head spin but let
[39:37.480 --> 39:42.560]  me just settle down and stop right there and we'll get into the latest
[39:42.560 --> 39:51.920]  developments because we have these new articles pointing out I mean again we're
[39:51.920 --> 39:55.960]  overwhelmed here we have hundreds of news articles saying the military's main
[39:55.960 --> 39:59.360]  enemy is the gun owners of the tea party and the veterans veterans first and
[39:59.360 --> 40:02.640]  Christians but veterans are first number one enemy I mean that tells you the
[40:02.640 --> 40:10.040]  government's been taken over by enemies right there I mean case closed then you've
[40:10.040 --> 40:14.720]  got hundreds of articles saying isn't it great that the military is trying to
[40:14.720 --> 40:17.600]  take on the evil tea party because they're probably gonna blow stuff up
[40:17.600 --> 40:21.360]  when the tea party's done nothing wrong but the Justice Department saying oh no
[40:21.360 --> 40:26.480]  to every police department they're getting ready to kill you can anybody
[40:26.480 --> 40:35.160]  say frame up getting ready I mean two plus two does equal four but then you
[40:35.160 --> 40:40.480]  go look at the commander see we start pointing out hey look this jade home
[40:40.480 --> 40:44.840]  logo is part of a larger operation mastering the human domain that's an
[40:44.840 --> 40:50.400]  overall program that's ten years old accelerated the last three years for
[40:50.400 --> 40:54.800]  total domestic domination of the US and the world and total control of all
[40:54.800 --> 40:59.200]  information and then paramilitary forces lined up to back that up and then we
[40:59.200 --> 41:03.680]  go hey let's look at the commander oh he's the one task with domestic
[41:03.680 --> 41:11.240]  takeovers and the one talking about shooting demonstrators oh and there's a
[41:11.240 --> 41:15.800]  new report we've got the video info wars calm it's on drudge report calm
[41:15.800 --> 41:21.840]  special forces trained with cops for house-to-house raids South Carolina
[41:21.840 --> 41:26.400]  residents warned they may encounter military drills and they're told by the
[41:26.400 --> 41:30.040]  local news oh don't worry it's for overseas yeah with the local police
[41:30.040 --> 41:35.040]  practicing busting down the doors no it's not there's been a secret program for
[41:35.040 --> 41:40.320]  at least 20 years it's in my film road to tyranny the documents the photos the
[41:40.320 --> 41:45.760]  Marine Corps officer I'll just say no it was not non-commissioned it's above
[41:45.760 --> 41:55.520]  that it was face blacked out no reason he called me as he lives here in Austin
[41:55.520 --> 41:59.400]  he owns a computer company now he was driving and there was an army check
[41:59.400 --> 42:02.800]  point I-35 searching cars
[42:04.440 --> 42:08.280]  and they wanted to search his car and he heard me talking about it heard the
[42:08.280 --> 42:11.480]  news saying it didn't exist so he brought me in and he was showing me
[42:11.480 --> 42:16.280]  nothing classified but photos of him at Space Command doing guard and running
[42:16.280 --> 42:22.080]  some guards and all the things he did and how they would raid gun shops in
[42:22.080 --> 42:30.480]  police uniforms basically and then we got documents from the FBI on video I
[42:30.480 --> 42:34.360]  mean it's in my film wrote police say to the takeover where where there's an
[42:34.360 --> 42:40.280]  army checkpoint on 35 and a car pulls up an FBI agent gets out hands Mike Hansen
[42:40.280 --> 42:44.400]  a document and says now get out of here you've been given what you asked for and
[42:44.400 --> 42:48.520]  Mike already been there two hours so he said okay and then Mike gets in his car
[42:48.520 --> 42:53.520]  and it's classified says restricted but we later learned it was classified and
[42:53.520 --> 42:58.840]  it's like the districts in Texas and how the army serves warrants secretly and
[42:58.840 --> 43:03.880]  how they also do helicopter surveillance and ground penetrating radar I mean
[43:03.880 --> 43:07.600]  it's in the film the documents are on info wars.com so this has been going on
[43:07.600 --> 43:15.880]  but the point is it's exponentially going up but we have footage of an FBI
[43:15.880 --> 43:23.400]  agent getting out of a car walking over as the army flips out on us and after
[43:23.400 --> 43:26.520]  the police start threatening to arrest Mike Mike says I'm not going I'm gonna
[43:26.520 --> 43:32.720]  know who's in charge the FBI shows up one guy gets out of his LTD and hands Mike
[43:32.720 --> 43:40.760]  a secret document I mean my life is a twilight zone folks Mike doesn't want
[43:40.760 --> 43:44.320]  to come on the show he doesn't want to be in public life anymore and I just
[43:44.320 --> 43:47.640]  talked to him the other day and his mom's been sick and stuff but and he's
[43:47.640 --> 43:52.720]  very successful in business but I'm he just doesn't want to come on the show
[43:52.720 --> 43:57.320]  I've got to make Mike Hansen come on the show he was my cameraman and went on
[43:57.320 --> 44:02.560]  all these trips he's seen everything of course we have the footage he shot too but
[44:02.560 --> 44:07.800]  that'd be a great interview to get
[44:07.800 --> 44:14.560]  he's seen everything he went into Bohemian Grove with me he saw the
[44:14.560 --> 44:19.960]  special forces guy try to set the fire and blame us in in Florida he saw the
[44:19.960 --> 44:24.760]  dirty tricks he was there when the four guys five of them total before attacked
[44:24.760 --> 44:28.440]  me outside the TV station he came out right at the end of it as they were
[44:28.440 --> 44:32.360]  helping themselves into the blue Astro van I'm not saying I'm the toughest guy
[44:32.360 --> 44:38.440]  around but I mean four guys start pounding you you get pretty mean but
[44:38.440 --> 44:42.440]  that's when you either curl up in a ball and give up or you open a big can of
[44:42.440 --> 44:48.800]  Tyrannosaurus rex and start really really hurting some people and I can't help it
[44:48.800 --> 44:52.200]  I'm a primitive animal at that certain level I actually relish the fact that I
[44:52.200 --> 44:55.600]  tore one guy's nose off and stomped another guy's head in and just
[44:55.600 --> 45:01.480]  savaged them viciously but the point is is that we need to understand this is
[45:01.480 --> 45:07.240]  really going on ladies and gentlemen I get really upset about this stuff we're
[45:07.240 --> 45:09.200]  gonna get to this footage coming up in a moment I'm gonna give you a whole
[45:09.200 --> 45:11.640]  presentation on the skip this network break that's the last of the day I've
[45:11.640 --> 45:19.040]  got to stop before I go any further
[45:21.880 --> 45:27.120]  we have a new product I want to thank you all for so many of you getting it
[45:27.120 --> 45:33.720]  because that helps from the operation but separately Prostagard is a low cost
[45:33.720 --> 45:38.100]  the leading competitor is $40 and I'm gonna just tell you it's got two
[45:38.100 --> 45:41.400]  ingredients and isn't even as good as ours that has 10 ingredients it has the
[45:41.400 --> 45:44.840]  same two they have so I don't get why these companies just don't put out
[45:44.840 --> 45:48.200]  something incredibly awesome but I mean I guess they just think people are
[45:48.200 --> 45:52.560]  ignorant well I know you're not ignorant and I love you and you love me and we're
[45:52.560 --> 45:59.760]  we're together on this and I'm about win-win 360 win Prostagard is 1995 it is
[45:59.760 --> 46:06.000]  totally organic it's time to start assisting the body and regulating proper
[46:06.000 --> 46:10.080]  prostate balance I'm 41 I've been on similar stuff for a year and a half that
[46:10.080 --> 46:13.800]  cost again 40 bucks and now we've developed this a year in the making
[46:13.800 --> 46:18.300]  introducing the all-new M4s life Prostagard plant-based nutrients and
[46:18.300 --> 46:22.340]  antioxidants that help give your body total support and again we should may
[46:22.340 --> 46:26.840]  oh clinic just on the saupon meadow yesterday them admitting that it's it
[46:26.840 --> 46:34.120]  works a hand-selected blend of saupon meadow and this is the stuff that they
[46:34.120 --> 46:39.160]  really say is key like a pin my pronounced that right I think it's like
[46:39.160 --> 46:44.000]  opine like opine plant sterols zinc vitamin D3 selenium and copper and
[46:44.000 --> 46:47.960]  more but the point is saupon meadow is traditionally used by American Indians
[46:47.960 --> 46:52.280]  and other cultures they'll support the body's natural urinary and reproductive
[46:52.280 --> 46:55.880]  systems this is something I take every day and from my research it's something
[46:55.880 --> 46:59.400]  that men should really be adding to their daily regimen in order to keep their
[46:59.400 --> 47:04.080]  body going and optimal levels that goes way beyond the prostate now is the time
[47:04.080 --> 47:07.640]  to start supporting your body in a way it regulates proper prostate balance get

[47:37.160 --> 47:40.520]  doing a few years ago without a lot of success and it's dynamic how much
[47:40.520 --> 47:47.400]  success I'm having I mean I'm losing weight I feel good I can lift a lot more
[47:47.400 --> 47:53.920]  weight lift a lot longer I can hike a lot further I could swim further it's
[47:53.920 --> 47:58.880]  just my body wow has the fuel it needs what an original thought I mean my
[47:58.880 --> 48:06.360]  Dodge car or my Ford truck they didn't have gasoline or oil they wouldn't run
[48:06.360 --> 48:12.360]  very long so it kind of comes down to that now we're gonna skip this network
[48:12.360 --> 48:20.520]  break we're going to break down right now the biggest news yet on the Jane
[48:20.520 --> 48:26.960]  Helm front now again recapping we have 200 to 500 mainstream news articles at
[48:26.960 --> 48:32.760]  national TV stations every day international as well saying there is no
[48:32.760 --> 48:36.240]  militarization of police there is no police state there is no military plan
[48:36.240 --> 48:40.280]  for domestic operations in America even though the army war college north calm
[48:40.280 --> 48:45.720]  south calm sent calm all have missions domestically all admit their training to
[48:45.720 --> 48:49.920]  take on the public during insurrection or or during demonstrations or during
[48:49.920 --> 48:54.480]  rioting while the Justice Department tries to stir up the rioting as the
[48:54.480 --> 48:58.920]  pretext is to incrementally roll this out we're not saying martial laws coming
[48:58.920 --> 49:04.400]  this summer we're saying that this is part of an incremental conditioning and
[49:04.400 --> 49:08.920]  a national poll voters say that they're worried about military exercises leading
[49:08.920 --> 49:13.520]  to federal control of states 45% national poll at least 45% or someone
[49:13.520 --> 49:20.920]  awake it's beyond that ladies and gentlemen Al Sharpton says they want
[49:20.920 --> 49:25.160]  to federalize the police using these Justice Department George Soros stirred
[49:25.160 --> 49:30.440]  up events so they're providing the pretext as well for the rollout so the
[49:30.440 --> 49:34.240]  public will ask for it then the media makes it about the troops and says we
[49:34.240 --> 49:39.920]  hate the troops that's not what's happening the military on record has
[49:39.920 --> 49:44.560]  been training for gun confiscation domestic operations under the John
[49:44.560 --> 49:48.120]  Ward defense authorization act under homeland security you've seen in
[49:48.120 --> 49:51.960]  Katrina you've seen other areas we've seen drills all over the country we've
[49:51.960 --> 49:56.800]  shown the video of them the police ask why'd you get armored vehicles in
[49:56.800 --> 50:02.000]  Indiana or in Washington state and they say four veterans for gun owners for
[50:02.000 --> 50:05.840]  constitutionalist and then we have the FBI and Justice Department training
[50:05.840 --> 50:09.560]  manuals for the police departments that are reissued every year and sometimes
[50:09.560 --> 50:13.600]  every month in bulletins so we have thousands of them and they're all
[50:13.600 --> 50:16.880]  basically the same thing gun owners veterans Christians are bad they're
[50:16.880 --> 50:19.840]  coming we've got to get them they're about the stage terror attacks when
[50:19.840 --> 50:23.480]  Christians and gun owners aren't doing anything so when the attacks come you
[50:23.480 --> 50:27.880]  better believe the prime suspects are those that stand to gain from this who
[50:27.880 --> 50:34.000]  want to demonize this it's a clear clear clear setup now I want to get to this
[50:34.000 --> 50:39.600]  piece first here's the new huge Jade Helm news we're gonna get to it the
[50:39.600 --> 50:44.680]  commander of Jade Helm runs the domestic homeland security operation to
[50:44.680 --> 50:50.560]  suppress the American people during unrest that is in an army document
[50:50.560 --> 50:55.440]  linked at info wars dot com to the army document Jade Helm commander plans to
[50:55.440 --> 51:01.600]  operationalize the conus base gonna read you the quotes that's today info wars
[51:01.600 --> 51:06.280]  dot com now here's the new one from info wars dot com and Gary French he has
[51:06.280 --> 51:14.680]  compiled at the next news network he has compiled special forces trained with
[51:14.680 --> 51:20.120]  cops for house-to-house raids South Carolina residents warn they may
[51:20.120 --> 51:24.440]  encounter military vehicles this is what they said Jade Helm is working with
[51:24.440 --> 51:31.640]  local police well we know from Iowa in Arcadia stuff that happened four years
[51:31.640 --> 51:34.960]  ago and others it was for gun confiscation they admitted in the
[51:34.960 --> 51:37.920]  newspaper we're gonna practice raiding the local gun shop and then
[51:37.920 --> 51:45.280]  confiscating guns door-to-door in the town of 600 roughly about 300 homes it
[51:45.280 --> 51:48.360]  was in the newspaper we read out of the newspaper then they came out said no
[51:48.360 --> 51:52.200]  it's not true Alex Jones made that up this is what's going on so let's go
[51:52.200 --> 51:58.320]  ahead and play this report out of Richland County South Carolina this is
[51:58.320 --> 52:02.800]  not the sage operations and others that they've had in the past this is the
[52:02.800 --> 52:09.000]  preparation to condition the public for snatching grab teams to augment the
[52:09.000 --> 52:15.960]  police and the nationwide rollout of what was quietly being prepared in 2005
[52:15.960 --> 52:21.400]  2006 2007 which was previously rolled out under Clinton but then suspended
[52:21.400 --> 52:29.160]  so I'm not partisan but under Democrats the domestic arm of this grows let's go
[52:29.160 --> 52:35.200]  ahead and go to this special report it's on info wars.com here it is breaking
[52:35.200 --> 52:38.920]  news out of South Carolina in what appears to be the second such drill
[52:38.920 --> 52:43.240]  special forces have been deployed domestically alongside local sheriffs
[52:43.240 --> 52:48.240]  to train for midnight raids in Richland County footage you're seeing right now
[52:48.240 --> 52:52.440]  is the third special forces group out of Fort Bragg conducting a nighttime raid
[52:52.440 --> 52:57.800]  during an exercise this is the special forces unit deployed. Sheriff Leon Lotz
[52:57.800 --> 53:03.040]  stated that quote Richland County is an ideal location for training that cannot
[53:03.040 --> 53:08.000]  be replicated at Fort Bragg coordinating with the special forces will be the
[53:08.000 --> 53:13.680]  county's special response team or SWAT to provide quote simulated scenarios for
[53:13.680 --> 53:18.400]  the military. What's more chilling than coordinated domestic raid training is
[53:18.400 --> 53:22.320]  that official report state that live ordinance and gunfire will be
[53:22.320 --> 53:26.880]  employed. The top it off the media has been restricted from any kind of
[53:26.880 --> 53:33.600]  embedded reporting to provide transparency for the drills. Now you can
[53:33.600 --> 53:36.840]  add this drill to the long list of domestic training exercises that have
[53:36.840 --> 53:40.680]  occurred so far this year FEMA camp roundup drills in Florida martial law
[53:40.680 --> 53:44.920]  training in California Marines prepping for riot control in Virginia and of
[53:44.920 --> 53:50.280]  course the mother of all drills Jade Helm. This is another glaring example of
[53:50.280 --> 53:54.160]  the militarization of local police nationwide who have received nearly half
[53:54.160 --> 53:59.560]  a billion dollars in military equipment from the Department of Defense. So this
[53:59.560 --> 54:04.880]  begs the question who is training who. When local sheriffs receive military
[54:04.880 --> 54:08.560]  equipment and then the special forces train alongside SWAT the lines are
[54:08.560 --> 54:13.200]  blurred. The color of authority is transferred to the local police as they
[54:13.200 --> 54:18.800]  become a militarized force. Local law enforcement can't violate Posse Comitatis
[54:18.800 --> 54:23.800]  but they can use the same equipment and tactics as the military making them one
[54:23.800 --> 54:27.720]  in the same just a different jurisdiction thus scurrying the law and
[54:27.720 --> 54:32.800]  violating the Constitution. The next question is who is the intended target
[54:32.800 --> 54:36.920]  well I'll leave that up to you in the comment section below I'll give you a
[54:36.920 --> 54:44.560]  hint you train where you deploy for the next news network I'm Gary Franchi. And
[54:44.560 --> 54:47.960]  when you read into all the documents and I'm gonna get to one right now they
[54:47.960 --> 54:56.720]  say it's for America and understand it's exponential and it all comes from the
[54:56.720 --> 55:01.800]  Rand Corporation and we have it on screen we go back to the very top of it
[55:01.800 --> 55:06.960]  the PDF the Rand Corporation and then scroll to the title of the document
[55:06.960 --> 55:14.640]  please this is the National Police Stabilization Force there it is a
[55:14.640 --> 55:20.320]  stability police force for the United States justification and options for
[55:20.320 --> 55:26.320]  creating US capabilities I first saw this in 1998 being pushed by the Austin
[55:26.320 --> 55:29.120]  American Statesman so I went to the document itself at the UT law library
[55:29.120 --> 55:35.000]  it's updated yearly and it said they'll have the local police under Northcom this
[55:35.000 --> 55:39.600]  is before they even set up Northcom officially under Northcom in Conis
[55:39.600 --> 55:45.760]  that's the continental US and that they would then have the local police under
[55:45.760 --> 55:50.640]  Northcom fully integrated into the US military I mean this is everything
[55:50.640 --> 55:54.840]  George Washington warned us about and they think you're stupid on Fox News and
[55:54.840 --> 55:58.480]  CNN they get up there on the 5 I never played this yesterday we're gonna play
[55:58.480 --> 56:01.840]  in the next hour why are they listening to all the shows why does Senator Cruz
[56:01.840 --> 56:06.200]  listen to a kook what is wrong with Chuck Norris so what is wrong with
[56:06.200 --> 56:11.400]  governor Abbott I mean this is crazy why do they hate our troops we don't hate
[56:11.400 --> 56:17.040]  troops Kettler deployed the military in Germany I mean the military wasn't bad
[56:17.040 --> 56:24.800]  then but they were under the control of that guy and they're ramping it up while
[56:24.800 --> 56:27.440]  they start announcing there's no free speech they're gonna take over the
[56:27.440 --> 56:31.000]  internet while they start banning free speech in Europe I mean there's
[56:31.000 --> 56:37.840]  tyranny worldwide here the article is on info wars calm and prison planet calm
[56:37.840 --> 56:40.880]  right now you can see the video we detail it all and add a bunch of other
[56:40.880 --> 56:45.840]  backup videos to it and of course Joe Biggs is talking some of his Fort Bragg
[56:45.840 --> 56:49.360]  sources and it's actually footnote in the article they were calling us saying
[56:49.360 --> 56:52.560]  you know this is the second year they've done this yes and there's always this
[56:52.560 --> 56:56.080]  idea that well we've done this before so it's okay see well we've always had
[56:56.080 --> 56:59.440]  armored vehicles on the streets well we've always had NSA spying well we've
[56:59.440 --> 57:05.840]  always had open borders now the next thing you want to read document Jade
[57:05.840 --> 57:12.560]  Helm commander plans to operationalize the conus base military seeking to
[57:12.560 --> 57:16.520]  gain full spectrum picture of everyday lives of their adversaries and they go
[57:16.520 --> 57:20.960]  on in the document with the quotes to say and the same document talks about
[57:20.960 --> 57:25.840]  taking on demonstrators and killing them special ops command seeks to
[57:25.840 --> 57:29.560]  operationalize the homeland informationally aware smartphone enable
[57:29.560 --> 57:33.680]  urban populations and their satisfaction or lack of satisfaction with local
[57:33.680 --> 57:38.520]  regional and even global conditions see it's sociology it's anthropology I'm
[57:38.520 --> 57:45.000]  reading from the document and that's what it is general Cleveland who runs
[57:45.000 --> 57:51.440]  Jade Helm penned a strategy document September 2014 titled AR SOF operating
[57:51.440 --> 57:57.720]  concept 2022 let me go back to his other document from 2012 in the multipolar
[57:57.720 --> 58:01.320]  world non-state actors with access to internet other communications will be
[58:01.320 --> 58:05.480]  able to interface and influence each other around the globe the significant
[58:05.480 --> 58:08.840]  difference will be greater ability of non-state actors to defend themselves and
[58:08.840 --> 58:14.360]  to influence or attack other populations we find the part about the conus
[58:14.360 --> 58:21.480]  base and motivated individuals general Cleveland penned the strategy the
[58:21.480 --> 58:26.640]  strategy outline the document seeks to establish a worldwide network of military
[58:26.640 --> 58:30.200]  influence to gather intelligence on key populations and non-state actors of
[58:30.200 --> 58:34.160]  empowered individuals then they go on the document to talk about domestic
[58:34.160 --> 58:37.600]  groups who are empowered and then that term ends up in Southern Barbie Law
[58:37.600 --> 58:41.800]  Center documents say I mean this is for America and it gets into working with
[58:41.800 --> 58:47.960]  local police visit again to understand the populations we'll be back

[01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:19.200]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:34.920]  Alex Jones. All right ladies and gentlemen if you just joined us we're
[01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:40.360]  breaking down the latest developments on the Jade Helm front I just aired a
[01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:44.800]  breakdown showing pieces of local newscast that Gary Franchi put together
[01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:49.200]  their next one job on the investigative journalist founder of Lone Lantern Society
[01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:55.600]  document Jade Helm commander plans to operationalize the Conus base and they
[01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:59.240]  admit that army manual outlines plans to kill rioters demonstrators in America
[01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:03.720]  but first they'll have the saw out media stir people up to go out and do it so
[01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:07.000]  there's an excuse to bring the military on the streets how do we stop this
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:11.720]  special forces train with cops for house-to-house raids South Carolina
[01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:15.440]  residents warned they may encounter military vehicles so basically Jade
[01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:19.920]  Helm is just one part of larger operations if you go to drudge report
[01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:27.080]  dot com on the right hand side he's got the story right above it a major
[01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:32.240]  newspaper calls for making cash illegal that way they can track everything you
[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:35.760]  do and turn your smart card off and you can't buy or sell then they have police
[01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:40.280]  mop up any of the farmers markets or anything else they're moving to make
[01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:44.640]  barter illegal we're moving into an area folks where we've see because voting
[01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:49.040]  with your dollars is power and if you keep voting against GMOs and voting
[01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:52.840]  against tyranny with your dollars and supporting independent media it's over
[01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:58.000]  for them so they're moving in with the casual society control grid the smart
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:05.480]  grid very very very fast right now so that's all coming up I want to
[01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:15.840]  specifically hear from first-time callers about what is your take on all
[01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:21.440]  this what is your take on my breakdown and analysis this is undoubtedly for
[01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:26.760]  domestic operations why is it ramping up exponentially and how do we stop it if
[01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:31.120]  we know that most the military is awake to what's happening they're upset to the
[01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:34.920]  fact they have a domestic operation they know it's dual use they know the
[01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:38.840]  non-commissioned officers and up have been told no it's for domestic they
[01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:42.000]  ask why are we fighting role-players wearing John Deer hats in every
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:46.280]  scenario we've seen and screaming I have rights I'm an American the National
[01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:51.320]  Guards asking the regular armies asking the Marines are asking so now they're
[01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:54.560]  having this big peer pressure deal where they say none of this is for domestic
[01:02:54.560 --> 01:03:01.400]  you're a cook if you say it and people in the military are being told shut up
[01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:06.080]  it's not for America when they admit it's for America so it's the Psyop Psyop
[01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:16.960]  I think in 1984 they call it crime stop where you know something's one way it's
[01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:20.080]  like you're reporting on your dad for something the big brother your dad
[01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:25.240]  disappeared but then you they they tell you you never reported on your dad you
[01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:30.400]  have to actually believe you didn't do it and even though you know you did do it
[01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:34.480]  you then convince yourself you didn't I mean it's it's it's basically mental
[01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:39.640]  illness they're teaching people how to be mentally ill I mean they're still
[01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:43.720]  saying there's no NSA spying they're still saying when all the documents
[01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:46.840]  Republic it's admitted it's all come out they're saying we don't listen to any of
[01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:50.560]  you illegally in fact we don't listen to any of you because they define it as
[01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:56.080]  metadata the entire recordings everything you said metadata would be who
[01:03:56.080 --> 01:04:03.080]  you called the phone record they I mean they record 80 plus percent on the last
[01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:06.960]  thing that was leaked they admit it was accurate 80 plus percent is being
[01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:12.600]  totally saved email faxes phone calls and they're building new giant centers
[01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:16.120]  everywhere all over the country to get over a hundred percent you say we mean
[01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:18.920]  over a hundred they're gonna grab everybody else's data and record it
[01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:25.800]  forever see it's the compression remember ten years ago you couldn't keep
[01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:34.120]  more than 20 songs on a 30 40 songs on a iPod then keep thousands compression so
[01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:38.280]  I want to hear from you how do we stop this or am I wrong do you disagree with
[01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:49.040]  me I'd love to hear from you 800 259 92 31 first time callers 800 259 92 31
[01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:53.120]  we'll give new callers a chance to be involved on air and we've got so much
[01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:59.240]  other news as well new ISIS attacks you name it it's all coming on we don't know
[01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:03.640]  yet the cause of the train derailment that currently has six dead and over 200
[01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:07.020]  injured was it a failed infrastructure a result of Washington
[01:05:07.020 --> 01:05:11.080]  kleptocrats who make themselves rich while the country goes off the rails or
[01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:14.800]  was it a deliberate act of sabotage just as many people will wonder what
[01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:19.040]  happened when the US crashes the aftermath will be just as bad as this
[01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:24.000]  train crash except there won't be any outside help coming this horrific train
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.600]  crash is a metaphor for the trends that are about to derail and crash our
[01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:32.400]  economy and nation we just saw a train robbery by drug enforcement agency
[01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:38.080]  thugs taking $16,000 in cash from a man for no other reason than that they
[01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:42.000]  could get away with it our legal infrastructure and our economic
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:47.000]  infrastructure are broken down like two rails of a train track these foundations
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:51.240]  of our country are crumbling and it's not benign neglect but the deliberate
[01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:56.400]  sabotage of our nation and our economy this is David Knight reporting for

[01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:20.320]  basically for house raids snatch and grabs gun confiscations in South
[01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:26.000]  Carolina we now learn that Jade Helm commander's actually over a plan for a
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:30.800]  domestic takeover that's all on info wars.com with the videos and the
[01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:38.120]  documents but don't worry George Bush told us nine years ago there was no
[01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:45.400]  illegal NSA spying period inside the US and now Senator Marco Rubio the darling
[01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:52.040]  of the Republican neocons and rhinos has come out and said there is no spying
[01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:58.080]  just period it's just not happening and the NSA has come out and said they
[01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:03.880]  need more domestic surveillance in fact a GOP senator has come out and said
[01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:07.680]  domestic surveillance needs to be ramped up 80% of your phone calls and
[01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:13.840]  everything else is recorded on record totally illegal. Clapper said he
[01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:16.360]  never there was just none of this happening his lawyer came out and said
[01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:20.000]  well when he said that he didn't know about the program he just headed up the
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:24.360]  national security agency of course everybody knows that that's as big a
[01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:30.200]  lie as Bill Clinton saying he didn't have sex with that woman. It's all games and
[01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:33.480]  our story is linked on drudgereport.com special forces trained with cops for
[01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:39.640]  house-to-house raids and then they admit under Northcom that is their new
[01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:46.080]  mission but here is the senator this is worse than Obi-Wan Kenobi saying these
[01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:50.440]  aren't the droids you're looking for move along move along these aren't the
[01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:55.200]  droids looking for move along but you know we laugh at that we're not the
[01:09:55.200 --> 01:10:00.120]  listeners of the show and other people large percentage but not a majority are
[01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:08.920]  not in a total just a sense of disbelief dreamland. I mean whenever I this is the
[01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:13.160]  formula and Marvel Comics admits it where they'll put out the first Thor and
[01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:19.440]  it's it's it's silly it's for kids but it's entertaining and well done and then
[01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:23.800]  every subs one one is just a basically in a video game on the screen with CG I
[01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:27.880]  mean it's it's you they use video game programs they used to a fight scene with
[01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:32.600]  video game characters they even have the lines on their arms and legs you know
[01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:37.960]  from the computer game it's because the public accepts it and then each one
[01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:44.400]  gets dumber. I mean I once saw the new Avengers unwatchable my two children
[01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:48.280]  laughed at it the whole time it was just over the top bad acting over the top
[01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:53.640]  stupid the first Captain America the second one winner soldier pretty well
[01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:59.240]  done good acting I mean really first-rate movies I talked to folks in
[01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:02.280]  Hollywood they said the next one coming out is gonna be just like the others just
[01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:06.040]  totally screwed up and over the top stupid and they're doing that on purpose
[01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:10.360]  to basically dumb down the public you give people dumb art it makes them dumb
[01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:17.120]  but see you see what it has to do with the takeover it's suspended disbelief the
[01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:20.360]  public after just a few minutes they found this in major studies you can
[01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:24.280]  look them up once you've gotten acclimated to going to suspended disbelief
[01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:28.720]  why for those that don't know what suspended disbelief is or what happens
[01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:34.000]  to your brainwaves under it do you like kids make a noise or running around when
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:38.560]  you're watching your favorite TV show no you want to put them to bed and then
[01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:42.480]  you want to get in there it's like nine o'clock at night close the door close the
[01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:46.200]  windows you don't hear the planes flying over or whatever cars honking and you
[01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:51.520]  get in bed you turn your favorite TV show on you get some popcorn right I
[01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:57.560]  mean even I sometimes watch movies or TV and that's what you do that's because
[01:11:57.560 --> 01:12:01.760]  you want to get into suspended disbelief but I got to watch something like the
[01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:06.880]  godfather that's like so good it's like reality or I've got to watch full metal
[01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:13.480]  jacket I've got to see something by a master director and master actors that
[01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:18.560]  can bring me into it suspended disbelief is a willingness to suspend one's
[01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:23.560]  critical faculties and believe the unbelievable sacrifice of realism and
[01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:30.000]  logic for the sake of enjoyment and Joseph Goebbels I've read his writings the
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:34.560]  Nazi propaganda minister he said to the Nazi high command in the in the propaganda
[01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:38.680]  division the
[01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:46.360]  guess group fewer group of the fewer a group of fewer you can read these
[01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:51.880]  writings just search Joseph Goebbels writings on propaganda like Scribb and you
[01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:54.720]  can read hundreds of pages of it and you go oh my gosh that's what they're
[01:12:54.720 --> 01:13:02.880]  doing now and his contemporary in the U.S. was the nephew of Sigmund Freud who
[01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:07.720]  wrote the book propaganda Edward Bernays and they had a plan when they took the
[01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:12.720]  U.S. over they wanted to kill Bernays because they were they also wanted to
[01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:17.560]  kill H.G. Wells because they were contemporary propagandists with a
[01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:21.720]  global government plan and Goebbels hated them but that's a side issue they
[01:13:21.720 --> 01:13:29.680]  were competing propagandists all three of them and he says don't make the
[01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:35.040]  propaganda fancy or complex because that makes the mind think complex and it
[01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:40.640]  hits synapses that will then identify it as bull don't make it a puzzle make it
[01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:47.720]  real stupid real dumb down and real loud and then people will buy into it
[01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:51.200]  that's the old the bigger the lie the more they'll believe it because it's just
[01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:54.560]  over the top it's the whopper it's like Steve you're gonna steal still big steal
[01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:57.560]  a billion they make you a senator steal a hundred dollars they put you in the
[01:13:57.560 --> 01:14:05.400]  pen so they're all over the news still saying there is no NSA spying on you
[01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:11.000]  it's all metadata no metadata is phone records Billy called Jenny Jenny called
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:21.840]  Carol Carol called Wilbur I mean it's been declassified that for 20 years at
[01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:32.680]  least the DEA runs the domestic NSA system and is flagging people that look
[01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:35.160]  like they're buying more stuff than they're actually making money to the
[01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:44.760]  IRS illegally without warrants flagging people they think are dealing drugs from
[01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:48.480]  the phone call records then they go make up a fake case to go before a judge the
[01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:55.120]  judge knows it's all fake it's called parallel construction I mean they go
[01:14:55.120 --> 01:15:00.520]  and perjure themselves in every major case they've had heads up computer
[01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:05.280]  displays for at least six years at the threat fusion centers where where you
[01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:10.040]  are in lifetime they hit one button and there you are they had another button the
[01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:14.840]  phone turns on even if it's off doesn't look like it's on and sends them the
[01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:24.720]  audio back or the video do you understand I knew about this 20 years ago
[01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:31.840]  and people didn't believe me now it's old hat and the DEA doesn't care if
[01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:37.200]  you're in a car or a train and you are a well-known local arborist this case
[01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:39.920]  happened in Houston a few years ago the guy won his lawsuit most people just
[01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:47.400]  roll over he's flying down from what was in North Carolina to Houston you pull
[01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:51.360]  up the case and every year for over a decade he would bring cash because he
[01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:56.320]  got a discount they weren't hiding in it was after tax money then the other
[01:15:56.320 --> 01:16:01.560]  person was paying the stupid taxes no one even alleging of that to buy the
[01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:04.200]  trees he was getting out of Texas that would then be shipped when he came and
[01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:07.080]  picked the trees he wanted hand-selected then they were loaded 19
[01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:15.400]  wheelers well they just took his it was a $85,000 and he said no I'm going to buy
[01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:24.720]  trees they said sorry we're taking it you see this is where we live oh but
[01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:29.440]  we're not going into martial law but don't worry the senator says there is no
[01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:33.560]  spying get used to it just shut up there is no jade helm there are no open
[01:16:33.560 --> 01:16:37.960]  borders even the board patrol comes out and says we complete the smuggling
[01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:42.200]  process we load them on planes and cars and give them money and send the
[01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:47.040]  Democratic Party facilities to be given voting cards ID cards within one
[01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:54.600]  month total criminal felonies organized crime racketeering takeover oh but
[01:16:54.600 --> 01:17:00.480]  there's no threat the army just admits their main enemies the gun owners but
[01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:04.640]  see they don't want to debate about this because it's we force a debate on TPP
[01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:09.640]  the Senate just voted it down Senate votes against fast-tracking TPP huge
[01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:14.200]  victory doesn't mean we won the war we just won this battle we got the moral
[01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:17.560]  high ground what the globalists are doing is so over the top it's ridiculous
[01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:22.480]  but then the senator presidential candidate comes out and says the sky's
[01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:27.920]  not blue here it is the perception has been created including by political
[01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:31.360]  figures that serve in this chamber that the United States government is
[01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:34.720]  listening to your phone calls or going through your bills on them as a matter of
[01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:40.120]  course that is absolutely categorically false the next time that any
[01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:45.000]  politician senator congressman talking head whatever it may be stands up and
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:48.600]  says that the US government is listening to your phone calls or going
[01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:54.880]  through your phone records they're lying it just is not true except for some
[01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:59.920]  very isolated instances in the hundreds of individuals for whom there is
[01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:05.120]  reasonable suspicion that they could have links to terrorism and then he
[01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:10.200]  provides no proof that man is an enemy of this country he is a ball-faced liar
[01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:13.920]  he makes me want to throw up we're gonna go to break come back and go to your
[01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:16.640]  phone calls and then I'm gonna get to a bunch of other video clips of military

[01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:29.840]  cannot believe the lies I mean incredible I was told by a law enforcement
[01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:37.160]  person 15 16 years ago about how they have these heads-up displays how they
[01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:40.880]  could track everything in a lifetime and it's like a cult of lying they get them
[01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:46.120]  in there and they go okay you're in the cult now don't tell the public and then
[01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:49.560]  people leave the cult and tell us and we have everything and the documents and
[01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:53.840]  even how to run all this stuff and they just say doesn't exist and Rubio gets up
[01:18:53.840 --> 01:19:00.640]  there with his I mean ancestry.com it's come out shares your DNA with the
[01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:04.760]  police when you go to any major hotel or rent car it runs through the police
[01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:15.840]  database I mean this is all admitted I had a high level time-warner engineer at
[01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:21.080]  my office 18 years ago opening up a scientific Atlantic cable box to show
[01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:24.760]  me the camera and the microphone the microphone at that time two years later
[01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:28.320]  the hidden camera it was before video games interacting it was all wired in
[01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:33.320]  people in Australia found cameras in the damn boxes I mean they Samsung admits

[01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:43.120]  mean but don't worry Marco Rubio said getting people's faces see they want to

[01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:46.360]  back when I would go show films when they came out at theaters give speeches
[01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:51.400]  and I went yeah right Willie Nelson and then at the end I'm signing DVDs and
[01:24:51.400 --> 01:24:56.720]  also he just comes around the counter shoves his hand into mine and I looked
[01:24:56.720 --> 01:25:03.240]  at him and I said and I said deadlines and commitments what to leave in what to
[01:25:03.240 --> 01:25:08.160]  leave out and then I talked about so many miles a minute in the air and I got
[01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:13.400]  the quote right under pressure don't remember it now and he looked at me he
[01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:19.280]  says give me your phone number I gave my phone number like six months later gave
[01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:24.760]  my producers phone number you know that producing isn't like in movies for the
[01:25:24.760 --> 01:25:27.480]  producer owns the movie and radio the producer sets up the guests and stuff
[01:25:27.480 --> 01:25:33.240]  and in fact it was Traykin Cade working for us and he works over at 590 right
[01:25:33.240 --> 01:25:36.960]  now and he comes here and a Brady was willing Nelson's on the phone wants to
[01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:40.280]  talk to you and I sure that was Willie Nelson but it's just interesting story
[01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:45.600]  I'm not bragging about that but it's Fortune favors the bold and I've had so
[01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:51.040]  many blessings fighting tyranny getting involved being out there it's just been
[01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:55.440]  amazing and I wouldn't do it any other way and you know I want to go fly
[01:25:55.440 --> 01:26:00.160]  remote control airplanes with my son I want to go skeet shooting I want to go
[01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:05.960]  fishing I want to go to Colorado I don't get to do most of those things because
[01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:13.520]  I I can't I'll be out skeet shooting having the time of my life and I just at
[01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:15.840]  the back of my mind I go I gotta go fight the new world order I gotta go fight the
[01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:20.240]  new world order but I wouldn't have to live like that in this desperate death
[01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:24.400]  battle if more people out there wonderful smart people very race color
[01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:29.800]  and creed realized your leaders too and the journey of a thousand miles as the
[01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:35.600]  Chinese rightfully say starts with a single step cleaning the garage starts
[01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:39.640]  with moving the first thing out getting your life together stop and drinking or
[01:26:39.640 --> 01:26:45.720]  getting in shape or whatever it is getting your grades up whatever the
[01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:53.400]  case is reforming the police it all starts by first taking action and then
[01:26:53.400 --> 01:27:00.400]  on the journey you'll learn it's really the destination but the things I've seen
[01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:06.240]  the people I've gotten to know I could never even if I was a billionaire or the
[01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:13.280]  CEO of a major company or a movie star I could never have gotten the respect I've
[01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:20.200]  gotten and I don't even want that it's bizarre I feel humbled to have front you
[01:27:20.200 --> 01:27:23.920]  know to find out right before he died that Kurt Vonnegut was a listener and
[01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:28.040]  then to get a chance to talk to him and have him send me a hand painted painting
[01:27:28.040 --> 01:27:37.200]  I have to get the talk on the phone to the former he's on the show before he
[01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:41.440]  died chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Moore about the global
[01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:49.880]  takeover plan for America to know that General Boykin the former head of
[01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:55.880]  special forces is a listener or that Chuck Norris is a daily listener or that
[01:27:55.880 --> 01:28:01.160]  a third of Congress listens every day I mean do people understand how dangerous
[01:28:01.160 --> 01:28:06.400]  this broadcast is and I sit here I'm not bragging I want you to realize how
[01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:11.720]  important you are as listeners you're the foot soldiers I sit here blazed in
[01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:17.640]  light spotlights on me and the only reason I'm still alive is the good Lord
[01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:21.040]  above and the fact that they don't want to make me a martyr and emblazoned
[01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:28.000]  everything I've said and of all these points not the most important because
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:31.800]  providence of God's most important then the establishment understanding that
[01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:35.760]  destroying me will be too obvious they want to kill my name which is kill your
[01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:41.080]  name we're all in this together is that there are people in the government that
[01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:44.920]  are know what's going on and don't like what's happening and are in there
[01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:50.280]  quietly trying to blow the whistle and so the criminals are afraid because they
[01:28:50.280 --> 01:28:54.720]  don't know who's who and that's why they really have the NSA is to watch the rest
[01:28:54.720 --> 01:29:01.200]  of government and that's come out I mean it's come out that the NSA spies and the
[01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:07.160]  CIA spies on the Senate listens to their phones tracks everything they do black
[01:29:07.160 --> 01:29:11.240]  males them it's come out in my six black males parliament that's the government
[01:29:11.240 --> 01:29:15.520]  you wonder why the elected government won't do its job and just lets the
[01:29:15.520 --> 01:29:19.600]  bureaucracy do whatever it's wants the bureaucracy run by special interest and
[01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:24.100]  headed up by special interest has hijacked the country in his black

[01:29:57.880 --> 01:30:02.620]  you've probably seen plenty of pundits and a late-night talk show host make
[01:30:02.620 --> 01:30:06.680]  fun of parents who are skeptical of vaccines and even though it takes a room
[01:30:06.680 --> 01:30:10.640]  full of writers to produce one grade school level joke that couldn't get a
[01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:14.880]  audience to laugh without an LED panel directing them to do so they don't seem
[01:30:14.880 --> 01:30:19.520]  too keen on exploring the why some parents are concerned such as vaccines
[01:30:19.520 --> 01:30:24.800]  maiming around 30 children in Mexico two of whom died in zero of the funny guys
[01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:29.400]  want to talk about or how about the kids in Syria dead from vaccines courtesy of
[01:30:29.400 --> 01:30:33.480]  the World Health Organization but you may be thinking well you never hear about
[01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:37.160]  that kind of stuff here in America well that's because Reagan passed a law
[01:30:37.160 --> 01:30:41.800]  stating that you can't sue the vaccine makers so to all the guys who can't tell
[01:30:41.800 --> 01:30:45.480]  the joke without reading it off a teleprompter or having your producer
[01:30:45.480 --> 01:30:49.120]  whisper in your ear stick to making your designer suits look bad and leave

[01:33:48.680 --> 01:33:56.560]  minion of the globalist and I know where they're taking us leads to absolute
[01:33:56.560 --> 01:34:08.880]  squalor so out of my way that's what this Bible talks about
[01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:15.800]  get out of my way Satan get behind me
[01:34:16.160 --> 01:34:21.480]  that's what the system does it gets in your way it makes you submit to it makes
[01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:31.320]  you pay it tribute we're gonna be going to your phone calls here and then
[01:34:31.320 --> 01:34:35.560]  there's just so much news that I'll start going to after I take a round of
[01:34:35.560 --> 01:34:40.920]  calls or two I saw this yesterday but it's back in the news today it's just
[01:34:40.920 --> 01:34:45.720]  amazing EU pushes mandatory quotas for migrants military action against
[01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:51.840]  smugglers Africa is collapsing the Middle East is in turmoil they've got
[01:34:51.840 --> 01:34:57.920]  record numbers of illegals flooding Europe they had secret quotas under Tony
[01:34:57.920 --> 01:35:03.840]  Blair during that whole period and now they're getting ready to just open the
[01:35:03.840 --> 01:35:10.560]  floodgates and it's a Europe's job to take on all these unskilled uneducated
[01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:16.920]  people then give them welfare and of course then they get to vote and it is
[01:35:16.920 --> 01:35:22.040]  the takedown of Western civilization except for the armored University
[01:35:22.040 --> 01:35:26.040]  government and corporate reservations that are be total high security
[01:35:26.040 --> 01:35:32.600]  reservations where they're exempt in fact they even have rolling power outage
[01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:41.360]  rules in Austin but Terry town the elite neighborhood and the downtown area are
[01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:47.240]  exempt and they're exempt from power gouging and they even have all these
[01:35:47.240 --> 01:35:50.960]  secret security plans for the elite in this city that's why a lot of elite are
[01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:55.640]  moving here but other cities have it as well I mean it just never ends and if
[01:35:55.640 --> 01:36:00.120]  you live in one of those sectors it's bizarre so I've talked to folks you just
[01:36:00.120 --> 01:36:04.920]  get left alone if you actually live there I mean we're not in Kansas any more
[01:36:04.920 --> 01:36:10.640]  boys and girls and let me tell you and if you're a globalist with your retina
[01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:15.120]  scanner your ID card or your chip just like Rockefeller told
[01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:22.080]  Russo it's it's kiss my you know what's what he called it to the cops and
[01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:27.160]  everybody else it's diplomatic immunity that the UN already has will now to
[01:36:27.160 --> 01:36:34.360]  anyone part of the globalist system including police bureaucrats corporate
[01:36:34.360 --> 01:36:39.440]  people notice they're trying and partially the word is it's in the TPP to
[01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:43.000]  give diplomat that they've asked for it publicly but didn't get it to give the
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:47.600]  stock market heads and the big hedge fund heads and the carbon traders
[01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:54.480]  diplomatic immunity now they'll still burn cops here and there as a snack but
[01:36:54.480 --> 01:36:57.920]  in the future if you've been federalized you're gonna be above the law and
[01:36:57.920 --> 01:37:01.680]  actually even USA Today wrote an article two weeks ago saying federalizing
[01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:07.800]  police is the worst thing we can do but Al Sharpton admits that's the plan and
[01:37:07.800 --> 01:37:11.360]  again we're right basically on everything I've been telling you for the
[01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:15.000]  last few years they want to federalize police they're financing people to riot
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:19.640]  they're funding it George Soros it all comes out because I saw the signs looked
[01:37:19.640 --> 01:37:22.560]  at the names of the groups they're all Soros let me tell you what liars they
[01:37:22.560 --> 01:37:28.000]  are I've had not once but twice I'm not gonna tell those stories I had the head
[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:32.120]  rider not the head person who works for the White House but the head rider
[01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:37.240]  calming is the editor few years ago and they said we're writing an article we're
[01:37:37.240 --> 01:37:41.160]  journalists you work for the White House you get George Soros money you have
[01:37:41.160 --> 01:37:44.360]  weekly meetings it's all over the news they go no we don't I pulled up the
[01:37:44.360 --> 01:37:47.720]  Federal Elections Commission numbers and said there's three million from George
[01:37:47.720 --> 01:37:51.640]  Soros this year and here you are as a White House group and your weekly
[01:37:51.640 --> 01:37:58.040]  meetings let's move on now you don't like black people huh no I never said
[01:37:58.040 --> 01:38:03.280]  that you're not a racist I'm just like so you just want me to just respond like
[01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:08.800]  did I wait you know rape my wife today thing or you know did I rape the dog
[01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:15.280]  today I mean you know it is or did I rob a bank today I mean it's just this it's
[01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:18.920]  this question that automatically I mean it's but you realize they're villains and
[01:38:18.920 --> 01:38:22.880]  they know they're villains and the weird thing about it is you you meet them in
[01:38:22.880 --> 01:38:28.360]  person they're real weak cowards and they'll start going because I've been
[01:38:28.360 --> 01:38:32.360]  around these people you know I really I know you're not that family we all just
[01:38:32.360 --> 01:38:35.800]  come to do our job and I hope I hope everything turns out it's kind of scary
[01:38:35.800 --> 01:38:42.480]  you know I'm really kind of scared I've had military officers police chiefs and
[01:38:42.480 --> 01:38:46.680]  others who aren't that slimy but they go listen a lot of us know you're right
[01:38:46.680 --> 01:38:49.960]  but it's dangerous where this is all going and some of us want to be on the
[01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:52.960]  right side is when it comes down so we're just waiting to see what happens so
[01:38:52.960 --> 01:39:00.080]  keep working hard I mean it's it's it's it's beyond James Bond movie folks you're
[01:39:00.080 --> 01:39:08.600]  living in a 21st century corporate takeover war I just got chills and I'm

[01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:16.080]  they're coming after your kids and your guns it's normal when they're trying to
[01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:19.680]  force inoculate it's normal when they're trying to force fluoride in your water
[01:39:19.680 --> 01:39:25.120]  it's normal when you're under tyranny to get upset and say no I'm gonna go to

[01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:36.600]  our operation we try to only fund our operation with the most moral high
[01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:40.720]  quality products we can my doctor recommended I didn't have any problem
[01:39:40.720 --> 01:39:44.280]  but he said you're 40 you need to you know take one of our nutraceutical grade
[01:39:44.280 --> 01:39:50.120]  40 something was it was like $42 of tax with the doctor's office and I came to
[01:39:50.120 --> 01:39:53.560]  Anthony about a year ago who's involved with Dr. Group and my dad who's a
[01:39:53.560 --> 01:39:56.960]  chemist and others figuring out what the most important products for people are
[01:39:56.960 --> 01:40:00.720]  that are also you know good sellers that we can do a high quality version of and
[01:40:00.720 --> 01:40:07.040]  and cut the price on because the normal companies have five to seven times
[01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:11.200]  markup we just have a hundred percent markup which is still healthy sometimes
[01:40:11.200 --> 01:40:15.080]  more it was a lower-cost ingredients we've got to find our operation there's
[01:40:15.080 --> 01:40:19.600]  all these expenses but still we're such game-changers that well that's why we're
[01:40:19.600 --> 01:40:22.000]  successful people that are in the nutraceuticals know that I'm talking
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:26.320]  to folks that don't know about it infowarslife.com I was like man yeah
[01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:29.960]  you know I got three or four of these things that the medical doctors you know
[01:40:29.960 --> 01:40:33.720]  said get on because you got a doctor's offices now you get a 40-year checkup I
[01:40:33.720 --> 01:40:37.920]  mean the the smart ones are there with a whole nutraceutical division they don't
[01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:41.600]  put you on drugs they put you on on nutraceuticals and he said you know you
[01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:52.960]  need to get on the saupon meadow and you need to get on the lycopene and then
[01:40:52.960 --> 01:40:57.960]  ours just has a bunch of other good stuff in there and so I thought I went and
[01:40:57.960 --> 01:41:02.920]  looked with the big manufacturers that are organic we work with two of the
[01:41:02.920 --> 01:41:05.880]  biggest companies they're in the top five in the country to have some private
[01:41:05.880 --> 01:41:09.080]  label we came with our own formula this is this is amazing formula super high
[01:41:09.080 --> 01:41:12.240]  quality it's at least ten dollars less and leading competitor that doesn't even
[01:41:12.240 --> 01:41:17.640]  have as much in it and again took me a year to finally get this done we did
[01:41:17.640 --> 01:41:23.720]  it's nineteen ninety-five and it's half the cost of stuff they sell at medical
[01:41:23.720 --> 01:41:28.880]  doctors offices and it's organic it's super high quality it's been triple
[01:41:28.880 --> 01:41:33.600]  tested when the products were prepared when they were fused together and then
[01:41:33.600 --> 01:41:41.960]  by our offices triple tested on record by the top certified labs prostate guard

[01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:43.600]  ahead and start going to your phone calls Chris in New York then Ed for those
[01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:49.480]  that just joined us bombshell video info wars.com of the military training in
[01:42:49.480 --> 01:42:53.320]  South Carolina to basically take on citizens with the police and go door to
[01:42:53.320 --> 01:42:57.880]  door and round up and gun confiscation and then we've got the head of Jane
[01:42:57.880 --> 01:43:01.360]  Helm on record admitting they're doing a domestic takeover operation he admitted
[01:43:01.360 --> 01:43:05.920]  this two years ago and then four years ago in public documents so that's on
[01:43:05.920 --> 01:43:12.280]  info wars.com it's just really scary and but but but the fact that scary is that
[01:43:12.280 --> 01:43:16.000]  at least we know can force a public debate about it the military doesn't want
[01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:20.200]  to be part of this we have to give them the political cover like we did on
[01:43:20.200 --> 01:43:24.440]  Syria so they can say no and have that argument and not be the only one standing
[01:43:24.440 --> 01:43:28.760]  up we need more people to speak out Chuck Norris has come out against Jane
[01:43:28.760 --> 01:43:34.240]  Helm we need Chuck Norris to come out and give speeches we need American icons
[01:43:34.240 --> 01:43:39.840]  like that to join the governor Abbott and others we now's the time we're gonna
[01:43:39.840 --> 01:43:45.760]  lose everything if we don't all put out a maximum effort again it's Twilight Zone
[01:43:45.760 --> 01:43:51.680]  I'm on air saying Chuck Norris we need you help me I'll be one I mean it is
[01:43:51.680 --> 01:43:58.200]  just it is it is it is just bizarre it's bizarre pinch me when do I wake up
[01:43:58.200 --> 01:44:04.400]  Christian New York you're on the air welcome thank you Alex I want to talk
[01:44:04.400 --> 01:44:11.280]  about although you already talked about pretty much all the points but that guy
[01:44:11.280 --> 01:44:16.720]  that was taking the phone calls in regards to the Jane Helm situation that
[01:44:16.720 --> 01:44:22.920]  he said that the trainings are for anywhere anywhere in the world that
[01:44:22.920 --> 01:44:30.160]  could be the US also he said that he's going to have military portraying as
[01:44:30.160 --> 01:44:36.600]  civilians now when he says that and you add the training that they had on
[01:44:36.600 --> 01:44:42.280]  sovereign citizens and also all this George Soros Nazi funded groups like
[01:44:42.280 --> 01:44:47.880]  Black Lives Matters and the other one I forgot the names I see that as agents
[01:44:47.880 --> 01:44:52.800]  provocateur of course exactly that they're coming in with a solution to the
[01:44:52.800 --> 01:44:59.760]  riots while stirring the riots up with the other hand right and also you add
[01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:05.160]  another thing to the equation like that mayor from Baltimore that I think should
[01:45:05.160 --> 01:45:11.800]  be arrested or indicted at least given a standout order to let things get out of
[01:45:11.800 --> 01:45:19.560]  control then have the they all shot to suggest that federal police take over
[01:45:19.560 --> 01:45:23.480]  the whole situation another thing that I would like to address this is very key
[01:45:23.480 --> 01:45:27.560]  point we need to stop calling it martial law because you know they're not
[01:45:27.560 --> 01:45:31.640]  gonna call it that they're gonna call it civil emergency national stabilization
[01:45:31.640 --> 01:45:37.800]  force exactly federal emergency that's it they they are experts at you know
[01:45:37.800 --> 01:45:44.200]  playing games where they go there's no FEMA camps we call emergency centers we
[01:45:44.200 --> 01:45:49.600]  call them mass shelter compounds now you are locked up at night and we do
[01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:57.240]  forcibly inoculate and there is work absolutely well let's look at that you
[01:45:57.240 --> 01:46:03.760]  should do our repost of the report that you guys did on the field manual three
[01:46:03.760 --> 01:46:09.880]  dash 39 that's 40 I think that was excellent yeah army dot mill the plan
[01:46:09.880 --> 01:46:12.920]  for the civilian inmate labor camps and everything else but again they're not
[01:46:12.920 --> 01:46:18.000]  called FEMA camps so they go there's no FEMA camps it'd be like if we didn't call
[01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:21.760]  water water and then we said there's no dihydrogen monoxide well most people
[01:46:21.760 --> 01:46:26.720]  don't know dihydrogen monoxide is water so we're calling it water and they go
[01:46:26.720 --> 01:46:30.400]  no there is no water in America and you go is there dihydrogen monoxide they
[01:46:30.400 --> 01:46:34.960]  go yeah there is see they they play these semantic games it's like Bill Clinton
[01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:39.640]  reportedly only got oral sex hundreds of times from Monica Lewinsky so he doesn't
[01:46:39.640 --> 01:46:46.640]  consider that to be sex okay whatever he said he didn't have relations whether
[01:46:46.640 --> 01:46:51.040]  he's a liar so again you're absolutely right great caller Chris Chris is on
[01:46:51.040 --> 01:46:59.200]  target but see still we fall for the trap which we have to we just tell the
[01:46:59.200 --> 01:47:02.120]  truth we have to keep going no there's all these manuals here's all these
[01:47:02.120 --> 01:47:05.040]  documents here they are training and they go nope it's not for domestic
[01:47:05.040 --> 01:47:10.480]  operations liars and then we go yes it is and again I call that a slow laurus
[01:47:10.480 --> 01:47:14.840]  attack like in hacking where they don't send a bunch of data at your computer
[01:47:14.840 --> 01:47:19.640]  they keep asking the basic command over and over again it's like a handshake we
[01:47:19.640 --> 01:47:23.040]  keep reaching out to shake somebody's hand but never take it and run your
[01:47:23.040 --> 01:47:26.240]  fingers through your hair you keep reaching out reaching out it's the same
[01:47:26.240 --> 01:47:30.120]  they just keep having us go yes it is yes it is yes it is never getting to
[01:47:30.120 --> 01:47:35.600]  okay we're taking over so we can have a debate about they never even let the
[01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:38.480]  debate get there and we go here it is it's all over the place we could have
[01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:42.440]  troops coming out of the sky on us they go there are no troops that's a military
[01:47:42.440 --> 01:47:46.440]  tactic from before World War one where you're overrunning people and you've
[01:47:46.440 --> 01:47:52.240]  got people on loudspeakers saying this is not an assault in Mars attacks they
[01:47:52.240 --> 01:47:56.320]  lampoon it as a joke the aliens are landing in Las Vegas they're killing
[01:47:56.320 --> 01:48:01.320]  everybody with their ray guns and they say don't run we are your friends and
[01:48:01.320 --> 01:48:06.520]  even though people see other people getting shot disintegrated they stop and
[01:48:06.520 --> 01:48:13.280]  get killed and then the aliens laugh that's what's going on there is no
[01:48:13.280 --> 01:48:16.800]  NSA the floor rides good for you the vaccines are good for you there is no
[01:48:16.800 --> 01:48:23.040]  open borders there is no world government there is no I mean don't run we
[01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:27.360]  are your friends in fact used to we had an outro instead of saying we're on the
[01:48:27.360 --> 01:48:46.480]  march the impars on the run it was don't run we are your friends I mean that's all
[01:48:46.480 --> 01:48:51.600]  they do we're not taking money out of people's wallets without evidence the
[01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:57.040]  IRS doesn't do anything wrong but you watch the movie whether they're in
[01:48:57.040 --> 01:49:04.840]  Kansas killing people or in Las Vegas or DC it's all about there the friends
[01:49:04.840 --> 01:49:08.920]  remember the president comes he goes let's be buddies Jack Nicholson let's
[01:49:08.920 --> 01:49:15.240]  work together and he puts his hand out kneeling goes ah here's my hand and he
[01:49:15.240 --> 01:49:22.920]  takes it in the hand disconnects it's a robot and stabs him like a scorpion let's
[01:49:22.920 --> 01:49:29.040]  go another caller and in California you're on the air welcome hi Alex
[01:49:29.040 --> 01:49:35.520]  show time listener first time caller first of all I want to say I just
[01:49:35.520 --> 01:49:39.920]  graduated from a for-profit school electrical engineering and then part of
[01:49:39.920 --> 01:49:44.880]  our general education was to write papers and for my last English paper I
[01:49:44.880 --> 01:49:51.120]  researched new order people are about the coming second American Civil War my
[01:49:51.120 --> 01:49:54.240]  take was a little different than the jade home thing and jade home thing has
[01:49:54.240 --> 01:50:00.240]  really been an eye-opener over the past few I guess weeks or months here our
[01:50:00.240 --> 01:50:04.120]  take was more about the cartel coming up from Mexico once our borders have really
[01:50:04.120 --> 01:50:08.480]  been collapsed and turning to southwestern oh I agree there is a plan to
[01:50:08.480 --> 01:50:13.120]  break up the US down the road and they will use cartel warfare to do it and
[01:50:13.120 --> 01:50:17.440]  and intimidation and you're absolutely right that's part of a larger North
[01:50:17.440 --> 01:50:21.280]  American Union destabilization plan and then out of that they will bring in the
[01:50:21.280 --> 01:50:25.640]  North American Union security perimeter as the answer that's actually in the
[01:50:25.640 --> 01:50:33.880]  BAMF Canada 2007 documents okay and I don't wear my collar on my sleeve I
[01:50:33.880 --> 01:50:37.280]  stay there I'm gonna come back to you add and then stigma James Ron and others
[01:50:37.280 --> 01:50:41.320]  but here's the deal they've got lots of different destabilization programs going
[01:50:41.320 --> 01:50:44.960]  and then as one works better they'll start betting on that number or if
[01:50:44.960 --> 01:50:48.360]  something else looks better they'll go with that they've got multifaceted
[01:50:48.360 --> 01:50:53.480]  multivariate long-term strategic operations that the issue is they're
[01:50:53.480 --> 01:50:59.680]  now all growing and accelerating and beginning to go operational communist
[01:50:59.680 --> 01:51:03.320]  China freely allows the sale of bulletproof armor plates while our US

[01:53:13.600 --> 01:53:17.840]  business long ago we set out to create a product that was light years beyond
[01:53:17.840 --> 01:53:21.600]  colloidal and ionic silver through extensive research and testing we
[01:53:21.600 --> 01:53:26.320]  succeeded in making supernatural silver hundreds of times more effective some
[01:53:26.320 --> 01:53:29.960]  might call us a premium product but we've simply strived to be a product

[01:55:26.040 --> 01:55:32.040]  dominated you will be dominated a nation of sheep will be ruled by wolves
[01:55:32.040 --> 01:55:37.040]  Thomas Jefferson well I'm not stealing this from American sniper because it's
[01:55:37.040 --> 01:55:40.040]  an old saying I don't know where it comes from maybe you guys can look it up
[01:55:40.040 --> 01:55:46.040]  but I heard it a lot growing up in fact I got the exact speeches from
[01:55:46.040 --> 01:55:55.040]  basically both my grandfathers and my dad that is in American sniper
[01:55:55.040 --> 01:56:00.040]  where we're not wolves we don't feed on innocent people and we're not sheep
[01:56:00.040 --> 01:56:05.040]  we're sheep dogs and we will defend the sheep and that the violence and the
[01:56:05.040 --> 01:56:13.040]  aggression and the will we've been given is a gift from God and it is
[01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:17.040]  and I am sick of these wolves tearing the guts out all around me and now they
[01:56:17.040 --> 01:56:20.040]  can take down sheep dogs too folks and believe me they don't like us they are
[01:56:20.040 --> 01:56:25.040]  it is just so sick I'm sorry I apologize I'm gonna get the stigma James Ron I'm
[01:56:25.040 --> 01:56:31.040]  gonna get to all the video clips all the news and finish up with this
[01:56:31.040 --> 01:56:35.040]  treatise paper you wrote for your degree on American Civil War what you
[01:56:35.040 --> 01:56:39.040]  think is destabilizing let's go ahead well you know I was trying to stay
[01:56:39.040 --> 01:56:43.040]  earlier that I am African American but I don't wear that on my sleeve I'm also
[01:56:43.040 --> 01:56:49.040]  part Native American or European I'm probably annoying and happy to see
[01:56:49.040 --> 01:56:55.040]  showing Barack Obama announced he's the one for the presidency from the stuff
[01:56:55.040 --> 01:57:00.040]  says on the Illinois Capitol building and at that moment you know I really
[01:57:00.040 --> 01:57:06.040]  felt great being American but over the years what's been going on I'm not
[01:57:06.040 --> 01:57:10.040]  happy with Obama anymore I look at John Boehner who reminds me of early
[01:57:10.040 --> 01:57:16.040]  early character from Mississippi burning I seen Hillary and Bill and I
[01:57:16.040 --> 01:57:22.040]  was constantly I'm scared we didn't do galvanize in this country
[01:57:22.040 --> 01:57:29.040]  they want to energize racism so we fight with each other instead of
[01:57:29.040 --> 01:57:35.040]  fight with the globalist it's classic divide and conquer and lastly you know I
[01:57:35.040 --> 01:57:39.040]  live with a very intelligent woman she's a multi-breed master's degree in
[01:57:39.040 --> 01:57:43.040]  agitation a diehard Democrat it's hard to convince her to see what's going on
[01:57:43.040 --> 01:57:48.040]  that's because she's loyal to her cult I gotta jump but I want to speak to that
[01:57:48.040 --> 01:57:52.040]  they have cognitive dissonance they don't want to admit their worldviews wrong
[01:57:52.040 --> 01:57:57.040]  they tune into things that back up what their worldview is but the Pentagon
[01:57:57.040 --> 01:58:00.040]  other armies developed this the Russians tried to as well they developed a gay
[01:58:00.040 --> 01:58:04.040]  bomb to spray men with pheromones that make them want to have sex with each
[01:58:04.040 --> 01:58:07.040]  other that's London Guardian if you don't believe me look it up the media makes
[01:58:07.040 --> 01:58:10.040]  fun of that when I say I like because they think you're dumb and we'll look it up
[01:58:10.040 --> 01:58:14.040]  they prey on you being lazy and I'm looking out but also they developed
[01:58:14.040 --> 01:58:18.040]  different sprays that makes people get violent start killing each other and
[01:58:18.040 --> 01:58:22.040]  of course they tested it in Vietnam on people different chemicals and things
[01:58:22.040 --> 01:58:28.040]  PCP things like that they got stuff far worse than that just to tear each other
[01:58:28.040 --> 01:58:31.040]  apart well that's what they've given us but through psych warfare where we're
[01:58:31.040 --> 01:58:35.040]  going to tear each other apart you spray an enemy base that's the people with
[01:58:35.040 --> 01:58:40.040]  this cultural tyranny we carry each other apart we'll be right back we're going to
[01:58:40.040 --> 01:58:45.040]  go right to Stigma James Ron and others and I'm going to get to the financial
[01:58:45.040 --> 01:58:48.040]  news man there's a lot of a third hour coming up
[01:58:48.040 --> 01:58:56.040]  and it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop
[01:58:56.040 --> 01:59:01.040]  a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children
[01:59:01.040 --> 01:59:05.040]  focus all of our children are hit with modern mind control television music
[01:59:05.040 --> 01:59:10.040]  fast food GMOs sugars you name it young humans have not yet developed their
[01:59:10.040 --> 01:59:15.040]  nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions it's no
[01:59:15.040 --> 01:59:19.040]  wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic
[01:59:19.040 --> 01:59:23.040]  drugs working with my team we set out to find the best formula with the highest
[01:59:23.040 --> 01:59:27.040]  quality ingredients that children would actually like and take we worked with the
[01:59:27.040 --> 01:59:30.040]  leading manufacturer and nutritional supplements that are safe for children to

[02:00:21.040 --> 02:00:26.040]  coming at you live from deep in the heart of Texas on your phone calls right now
[02:00:26.040 --> 02:00:31.040]  and then I will get to a lot of important financial news in the next segment after
[02:00:31.040 --> 02:00:37.040]  other calls HSBC warns the world economy faces a Titanic problem that ties into
[02:00:37.040 --> 02:00:44.040]  why is China taking control of physical gold huge news on oil market volatility
[02:00:44.040 --> 02:00:51.040]  new ISIS attacks and more even the Hill newspaper criticizing the Federal Reserve
[02:00:51.040 --> 02:00:57.040]  reckoning for the Fed it's all coming up but right now we're talking Jade Helm the
[02:00:57.040 --> 02:01:00.040]  callers really haven't gone to my question though they're calling in on Jade Helm
[02:01:00.040 --> 02:01:05.040]  which is which is nice what do we do about it
[02:01:05.040 --> 02:01:11.040]  I mean we know it's for domestic operations we got more video of the military training to raid houses with the police and take guns
[02:01:11.040 --> 02:01:18.040]  in South Carolina we know what's happening what do we do stigma in Florida you're on the year
[02:01:18.040 --> 02:01:23.040]  Hey Alex Jones I want answers
[02:01:23.040 --> 02:01:36.040]  listen quick though I think the CD Jackson was more durable it contemporary than Bernays but anyways listen I'm a home score of two kids that are unvaccinated
[02:01:36.040 --> 02:01:41.040]  what do I do when CPS shows up at my door like they did in Kentucky what will my neighbors do
[02:01:41.040 --> 02:01:51.040]  well be very calmly open the door or don't open the door to make your decision I at first I wouldn't open the door
[02:01:51.040 --> 02:02:00.040]  I don't open the door for strangers on my time and but if you do just tell them listen there's no law that you have to
[02:02:00.040 --> 02:02:07.040]  vaccinate so no I'm not gonna let you in here to try to cook up stuff you know so you can claim you saw something so you can try to
[02:02:07.040 --> 02:02:14.040]  take my children away and I know my rights so I understand that you've been given some report or something but it's frivolous
[02:02:14.040 --> 02:02:22.040]  so I demand to face my accuser and I've been through this before that's what I've done but as long as you're very confident
[02:02:22.040 --> 02:02:28.040]  being scared of them is what they want if they're bad ones they have the highest turnover out there is a lot of them aren't bad
[02:02:28.040 --> 02:02:34.040]  and just quit so you end up with a bunch of bad ones left but I actually know so social workers are there's some of the most upset
[02:02:34.040 --> 02:02:40.040]  people about what's happening I know social workers that take care of old people that are really good people and they're the ones
[02:02:40.040 --> 02:02:45.040]  blowing the whistle on nursing homes and hospitals not taking care of folks and then they get in trouble
[02:02:45.040 --> 02:02:52.040]  so just again it's like blaming TSA will the government put them in charge by the way that's in the news in my stack
[02:02:52.040 --> 02:02:59.040]  came out judicial watch in fact I gotta find it I had it here and I can't find it that they knowingly grop genitals for fun
[02:02:59.040 --> 02:03:06.040]  and then make fun of people while they do it I mean it is sexual assault but they're trying to pass laws to make vaccines mandatory
[02:03:06.040 --> 02:03:15.040]  they want to make you take hundreds of them and it's basically a firing squad I mean Mexico just banned giving several vaccines this week
[02:03:15.040 --> 02:03:24.040]  because it was killing people but there's the headline documents TSA sexual abuse rife travelers have breast penises felt while
[02:03:24.040 --> 02:03:33.040]  screeners roar with laughter stuck his hands down my pants and grab the top of the penis and place his fingers in the butt crack
[02:03:33.040 --> 02:03:43.040]  yeah I have in Vegas had me grab a man grab my genitals first time ever only time and he just smiled up at me and look like
[02:03:43.040 --> 02:03:53.040]  you know he'd seen his heavenly his heavenly destination and so I mean I've never been sexually assaulted I guess until then
[02:03:53.040 --> 02:04:01.040]  and I guess he did it in a friendly way so I mean you know I did once in juvenile hall have the guy put me in the shower
[02:04:01.040 --> 02:04:06.040]  and say I wanted to have sex with me and I said you know I'm gonna physically defend myself I was 14 I wasn't a wimp
[02:04:06.040 --> 02:04:11.040]  I was in there for beating somebody's head in who started a fight with me but I had to wait until the next week when it was a court hearing
[02:04:11.040 --> 02:04:16.040]  and I said am I dad's gonna kill you so the guy said fine I'll look at somebody else but never had him actually put their hands on me
[02:04:16.040 --> 02:04:20.040]  till then but I'm sorry I digress go ahead to stigma
[02:04:20.040 --> 02:04:26.040]  yeah I just think that you know your answer to Jade Helm is you know neighbors need to get to know each other and when that
[02:04:26.040 --> 02:04:31.040]  SWAT truck rolls up and you just it goes down because it's gotta stop somewhere
[02:04:31.040 --> 02:04:35.040]  well here's what happens the first contact will be a bot probe stay there I'm gonna come back to you stigma
[02:04:35.040 --> 02:04:42.040]  the first probe will be a bot to come out and see if you'll just submit to be assimilated quietly don't run with your friends
[02:04:42.040 --> 02:04:47.040]  then if you refuse or ignore a court thing then maybe a SWAT truck comes later
[02:04:47.040 --> 02:04:53.040]  so if you're talking about going down with a SWAT truck you don't wait till they come if you're gonna go offensive
[02:04:53.040 --> 02:04:57.040]  you just want to explain everybody you don't wait till they come
[02:05:23.040 --> 02:05:27.040]  11 minor traffic accidents three collisions since September
[02:05:27.040 --> 02:05:34.040]  well maybe Google wasn't at fault but I wouldn't be a passenger in a car with a driver who had had three accidents in eight months
[02:05:34.040 --> 02:05:41.040]  and while they tell us their cars were not at fault California DMV said it's not able to release details of the accidents
[02:05:41.040 --> 02:05:47.040]  you know kind of like the secret trade agreements are being negotiated we're not allowed to see the details
[02:05:47.040 --> 02:05:54.040]  and all the while they'll be touting how their cars programmed by people are always safer than cars driven by people

[02:09:00.040 --> 02:09:06.040]  we have a caller stigma whose homeschooling his children he says he's not going to give them forced inoculations
[02:09:06.040 --> 02:09:11.040]  California's trying to pass laws to do it but in areas like Kentucky
[02:09:11.040 --> 02:09:16.040]  well there's not even laws they're showing up and taking people's kids saying you are not inoculated
[02:09:16.040 --> 02:09:20.040]  we say that that is neglect when it's not neglect
[02:09:20.040 --> 02:09:29.040]  neglect is giving kids deadly vaccines on record that are killing people and making them sick
[02:09:29.040 --> 02:09:38.040]  and the good news is people are waking up to this and they're getting upset
[02:09:38.040 --> 02:09:45.040]  I want to explain something I've read total resistance from different resistance movements against the Nazis
[02:09:45.040 --> 02:09:49.040]  I've probably read five or six books on guerrilla warfare
[02:09:49.040 --> 02:09:57.040]  I have studied it not because I'm planning guerrilla warfare but because I've studied so much military history
[02:09:57.040 --> 02:10:03.040]  and so much political history that I have found histories on guerrilla warfare interesting
[02:10:03.040 --> 02:10:11.040]  guerrilla warfare but then you can also add it into what's currently happening today
[02:10:11.040 --> 02:10:17.040]  and they program everyone through the media to believe what you see on TV is how stuff goes down
[02:10:17.040 --> 02:10:24.040]  the reason they want to go after the military veterans and say in hundreds of published reports
[02:10:24.040 --> 02:10:28.040]  well it's actually thousands because AP would be in thousands of papers
[02:10:28.040 --> 02:10:34.040]  thousands of published reports that the veterans are the enemy and a terrorist force that may destroy America
[02:10:34.040 --> 02:10:40.040]  must be dealt with well gee what's the globalist force planning that they know veterans will fight back
[02:10:40.040 --> 02:10:43.040]  well they're going to take their pension funds they're already taking their guns incrementally
[02:10:43.040 --> 02:10:48.040]  it's a test it's happening right now outside of law first they can't buy guns and they get a police visit
[02:10:48.040 --> 02:10:52.040]  and they take their guns and the wife they're saying do what the police say honey
[02:10:52.040 --> 02:11:02.040]  but the cops are just errand boys it's like in apocalypse now he's talking to colonel Kurtz the assassin
[02:11:02.040 --> 02:11:10.040]  the army officer and he says what are you and he goes I'm an army officer he goes no you're not
[02:11:10.040 --> 02:11:23.040]  an assassin no you're neither you're an errand boy sent by a grocer to collect a debt
[02:11:23.040 --> 02:11:31.040]  man the writing of that movie is just so incredible everything is like a lesson every line of it
[02:11:31.040 --> 02:11:39.040]  and it's so true
[02:11:39.040 --> 02:11:47.040]  but the feds had to discredit the militia movement back in the 80s and 90s so they went out and created
[02:11:47.040 --> 02:11:53.040]  most of the major leadership groups to enact foolish so they could brand it as silly and as hidden
[02:11:53.040 --> 02:12:00.040]  and as cornball all the real militias are just shooting clubs and military history clubs
[02:12:00.040 --> 02:12:08.040]  and they're all made up mainly of veterans and they're real and believe me the feds know about them
[02:12:08.040 --> 02:12:18.040]  but the military is the enemy because in the next 5-10 years and things are accelerating
[02:12:18.040 --> 02:12:26.040]  the entire military in actual combat is going to be autonomous robots ground sea air under sea
[02:12:26.040 --> 02:12:31.040]  that's all been announced they're announcing 90% of workers within 10 years and China will be a robot
[02:12:31.040 --> 02:12:35.040]  they're announcing you won't have doctors soon it's going to be a robot and a robot anesthesiologist
[02:12:35.040 --> 02:12:41.040]  this is a plan do you understand it's AI you want to know how AI is going to take over
[02:12:41.040 --> 02:12:45.040]  they're just building it and believe they're going to merge with it like it's their god
[02:12:45.040 --> 02:12:50.040]  robot pets are going to replace real ones because they're going to have regulations and laws against their poop
[02:12:50.040 --> 02:12:56.040]  saying it's bad for the earth see they're going to charge you for everything to socially engineer you
[02:12:56.040 --> 02:13:02.040]  and they have to have an artificial economy to where you can't afford anything and have to do what they say
[02:13:02.040 --> 02:13:09.040]  you comply oh I can't afford the insurance to drive my car myself so the robot does it
[02:13:09.040 --> 02:13:15.040]  and then soon that's too expensive so you ride the bus see and they've all said this is the plan
[02:13:15.040 --> 02:13:23.040]  they have children's cartoons in British school showing the world in 2025 where you get meat once a year
[02:13:23.040 --> 02:13:31.040]  and you never get to take showers and where you live in a 250 square foot coffin apartment if you're well to do
[02:13:31.040 --> 02:13:39.040]  that was out six years ago it's now already being implemented do you understand the systematic regulations
[02:13:39.040 --> 02:13:49.040]  of the global compact agenda 21 the Rio de Janeiro global treaty I just got chills again my god this is so evil
[02:13:49.040 --> 02:13:57.040]  a systematic evil takeover and getting us under their control in compact cities is only to get us lined up
[02:13:57.040 --> 02:14:02.040]  while they then exterminate the third world with wars and soft-kill weapons that are going to be
[02:14:02.040 --> 02:14:07.040]  are just being tested right now it's going to be off the chart thank god we're in these compact cities
[02:14:07.040 --> 02:14:12.040]  thank god and then they're going to shut the borders at that point they're bringing enough immigrants to cause
[02:14:12.040 --> 02:14:18.040]  infighting right now can't be in the rural areas contagions can spread in those and we've had nano tech
[02:14:18.040 --> 02:14:26.040]  get out and oh and then there's going to be all these controlled contrived crises and then what's going to be left
[02:14:26.040 --> 02:14:34.040]  there's going to be 45 50 and 60 year old veterans who still know how to fight who still got weapons buried
[02:14:34.040 --> 02:14:41.040]  who will be ready to maybe one stuff so bad and they're watching plagues rage and you know billions die
[02:14:41.040 --> 02:14:45.040]  they'll remember everything that was said they'll know that the old timers told them what was happening
[02:14:45.040 --> 02:14:52.040]  they will engage the local computer centers it'll be satellite backup it it's terminated folks we're about to face it
[02:14:52.040 --> 02:14:58.040]  for real and they'll take out some of those centers and then they're going to have the big global robot armies
[02:14:58.040 --> 02:15:03.040]  directed by the you and others are going to come in and try to dig us out they're going to have nerve gas
[02:15:03.040 --> 02:15:09.040]  bio weapons everything else they're going to try to mop up their main enemy they're just preparing is going to be the vets
[02:15:09.040 --> 02:15:17.040]  because it's only going to be combat vets working with scientists and people that are technocrats but who aren't evil
[02:15:17.040 --> 02:15:24.040]  are going to be in a huge war it is going to be the most incredible war ever and more and more I realize I just need to
[02:15:24.040 --> 02:15:30.040]  get ready and get people ready for the battle space I need to just try to affect the future battle space
[02:15:30.040 --> 02:15:38.040]  I'm not an enemy of the cops I'm on the enemy of the military or the bureaucrats even 95% of these people have no idea what's going on
[02:15:38.040 --> 02:15:45.040]  but we're trained by sitcoms and movies that the SWAT team invincibly pulls up at your house to get the rebels
[02:15:45.040 --> 02:15:50.040]  and they stack up at 3am and you know you think bed bugs bite well we're really going to bite you
[02:15:50.040 --> 02:15:57.040]  if a real civil war breaks out which I don't think they want to do right away they want to have some smaller ones just a beta test
[02:15:57.040 --> 02:16:06.040]  you don't and I'm not saying do this I'm saying if you really were going to resist you don't go out and engage the SWAT team
[02:16:06.040 --> 02:16:12.040]  you don't go out and engage notice their branding you protest with the Soros money by shooting a cop in the head
[02:16:12.040 --> 02:16:18.040]  no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no when it all goes down they're going to bomb the cops and stuff
[02:16:18.040 --> 02:16:23.040]  and said we did it trying to get them like a bunch of bees to come after us and they will don't worry
[02:16:23.040 --> 02:16:30.040]  and those of you that want some fight you're going to get it with them but the point is it's the bureaucrats and the criminals
[02:16:30.040 --> 02:16:38.040]  and the leadership in a war you don't go for the grunts you go for the big boys and I'm not even talking about these puppet politicians
[02:16:38.040 --> 02:16:45.040]  I'm talking about these globalists we all know who they are and there's millions of us in every major country that know the enemy
[02:16:45.040 --> 02:16:51.040]  know we're in a science fiction movie understand what's going on and we're not going to give up and when it really gets bad
[02:16:51.040 --> 02:16:57.040]  you think people are awake now when people know they got nothing to lose that's why they're getting ready to go after the military
[02:16:57.040 --> 02:17:04.040]  incrementally you're going to see this twisting this demonization in movies and sitcoms and books where the vets the bad guy
[02:17:04.040 --> 02:17:12.040]  the vet releases the bio weapon the vet does this the vet does that because it's going to be those battle trained groups
[02:17:12.040 --> 02:17:19.040]  when they phase out the military and steal their pension funds and put them on death panels and no treat list
[02:17:19.040 --> 02:17:30.040]  that are going to be there that are going to form the fist that the pro human intelligentsia in a death battle are going to throw at the enemy
[02:17:30.040 --> 02:17:39.040]  just hoping humanity makes it I mean we're getting ready for the huge AI war folks up against an AI system wired into everything
[02:17:39.040 --> 02:17:46.040]  it's already sentient that's clear it's already operating you can I mean there's a couple years ago looking at all the data and everything
[02:17:46.040 --> 02:17:52.040]  suddenly shifted we were up against something so much more sophisticated I saw everything shift at that point and it's gotten worse
[02:17:52.040 --> 02:18:00.040]  and by sentient it doesn't think it doesn't think the sunset's pretty folks it's wired into everything we're doing it's based on our brains
[02:18:00.040 --> 02:18:07.040]  and it's learning off us it's learning how to drive cars down the road it's learning how to kill us it's learning how to farm
[02:18:07.040 --> 02:18:17.040]  it's learning how to I mean it's autonomous it is autonomous and it's it's sentient and that's why all over the world
[02:18:17.040 --> 02:18:27.040]  inoculations are forced now all over the world you can't have cash now it's all going to start accelerating
[02:18:27.040 --> 02:18:40.040]  my god it's so epic oh my god and believe me they're part of me just says you know what give up move out in the country
[02:18:40.040 --> 02:18:47.040]  and just wait for everything to unravel I'm not going to do that I've had three children and you know what I think I'm going to
[02:18:47.040 --> 02:18:53.040]  have more I'm going to double down and bet on God and I'm going to commit myself fully to fight these people and I'm going
[02:18:53.040 --> 02:18:59.040]  to pray to Christ to give me the words and the intellect and the discernment I need and to control my anger because I'm
[02:18:59.040 --> 02:19:07.040]  so upset at these people I'm so mad knowing them studying them having to look at them the psychopaths I hate them I just
[02:19:07.040 --> 02:19:12.040]  we all need to pray and get ready because I'm going to go back to Stig when we come back and James and Ron I'm not even
[02:19:12.040 --> 02:19:21.040]  holding for an hour I've gone too long here I apologize it's just that all that matters is the species survive now we
[02:19:21.040 --> 02:19:27.040]  not be taken over by this evil I mean my god folks the vets are on don't treat death list we abort millions of
[02:19:27.040 --> 02:19:35.040]  children a year we're killing the old people I mean the future is just hellish the bioethics disposable humans I mean human
[02:19:35.040 --> 02:19:44.040]  life's always been cheap we're in the mopping up process to understand the decisions been made just like Chuck Norris said
[02:19:44.040 --> 02:19:51.040]  to his son you know you can get killed making this movie with Alex Jones and Gary Haven and he meant that is a good thing
[02:19:51.040 --> 02:19:56.040]  you know you understand what you're getting into but we're all going to die anyways and let innocence be taken over by evil if we

[02:23:56.040 --> 02:24:08.040]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[02:24:08.040 --> 02:24:13.040]  There's a war on for your health and a war on for your family and your soul and your future
[02:24:13.040 --> 02:24:22.040]  The caller Stigma was asking earlier, said in the for last I went on a rant
[02:24:22.040 --> 02:24:27.040]  What do I do when the SWAT team pulls up before something inoculate and there's not even a law
[02:24:27.040 --> 02:24:32.040]  Well the answer is you're not there when they show up
[02:24:32.040 --> 02:24:37.040]  You make it hard, you go to a family's house, you go to another state
[02:24:37.040 --> 02:24:46.040]  You engage in low intensity information warfare waking people up now in a campaign ahead of that to affect the future battle space
[02:24:46.040 --> 02:24:53.040]  But then if the Civil War kicks off or part of the Civil War a precursor and they're coming after you
[02:24:53.040 --> 02:24:59.040]  You don't kick it off with their minions who they can care less about and who they want to make martyrs
[02:24:59.040 --> 02:25:05.040]  You start identifying the power structure now and you begin attacking them in the Info War
[02:25:05.040 --> 02:25:10.040]  Letting them know they're being lazed and targeted
[02:25:10.040 --> 02:25:16.040]  Just like special forces will mark a target first for what's coming in behind it
[02:25:16.040 --> 02:25:22.040]  And that's all we're doing here is trying to have a peaceful discussion so the elite aren't totally insane
[02:25:22.040 --> 02:25:27.040]  So we pull back from Armageddon so we pull back from all this evil but regardless we know it's all coming on
[02:25:27.040 --> 02:25:34.040]  So we make preparation and you do that by engaging the enemy in the Info War and we're doing it
[02:25:34.040 --> 02:25:40.040]  And you remember they're not the authority, they don't have the power, they're losers, they signed up to a God who's a loser
[02:25:40.040 --> 02:25:42.040]  Who isn't a God at all?
[02:25:42.040 --> 02:25:47.040]  Their God is a fraud. Stigma, does that answer your question?
[02:25:47.040 --> 02:25:55.040]  Yeah, you know Alex, I feel like a piggy bank to my municipality and I'm not necessarily worried about a forcefully inoculating
[02:25:55.040 --> 02:25:58.040]  I'm worried about them grabbing the kids like they did in Kentucky
[02:25:58.040 --> 02:26:07.040]  Well, you know, they were on Facebook showing their ideal life and they unfriended somebody who then filed a report
[02:26:07.040 --> 02:26:11.040]  And they saw ten blonde-haired blue-eyed kids and get half a mill of peace for them
[02:26:11.040 --> 02:26:15.040]  And so you do the math, that's five million dollars
[02:26:15.040 --> 02:26:23.040]  And so, yeah, you know, and if you got a black-haired child with green eyes or blue eyes, there's quotas of up to a million bucks on them
[02:26:23.040 --> 02:26:29.040]  We had a state senator on who was about to expose it, they killed her two days before she was going to come on, shot her in the back of the head
[02:26:29.040 --> 02:26:31.040]  At her house
[02:26:31.040 --> 02:26:36.040]  They are, they just, they need to quit serving no-knock warrants for misdemeanors and civil infractions
[02:26:36.040 --> 02:26:41.040]  And, you know, if not, I think that they're taking, taking a risk themselves
[02:26:41.040 --> 02:26:48.040]  Well, they prepared the SWAT teams with Daryl Gates and the CIA as to classify the 60s and 70s as an example going after terrorists or bank robbers
[02:26:48.040 --> 02:26:55.040]  Well, yeah, big cities could have units like that, now they have them for the most pettiest stuff, and it's death squads, it's an intimidation force
[02:26:55.040 --> 02:26:59.040]  It's what horrible third-world nations in North Korea have, and now we have it
[02:26:59.040 --> 02:27:05.040]  But CPS warrior Nancy Schaefer gunned down, and remember that was five years ago, associated press
[02:27:05.040 --> 02:27:09.040]  Let's go to more calls, Ron and then James and then Smith and Luke
[02:27:09.040 --> 02:27:13.040]  Ron, you're on the air, welcome
[02:27:13.040 --> 02:27:15.040]  Hi Alex
[02:27:15.040 --> 02:27:23.040]  I do understand, something happened in Vermont yesterday that helped put the puzzle together for me
[02:27:23.040 --> 02:27:35.040]  You know, it's, you know, the Jade Helm thing, you know, they're trying to, they're successfully demonizing groups
[02:27:35.040 --> 02:27:41.040]  Cops versus the blacks in Ferguson, I'm not a cop, and I'm not black
[02:27:41.040 --> 02:27:48.040]  But you can see the artificial manipulation, people don't need to pick a side, they need to pull back and realize it's all bull
[02:27:48.040 --> 02:27:57.040]  If you could, let me finish, you know, I'm neither of those, you know, when the BLM, you know, went after the libertarians
[02:27:57.040 --> 02:28:05.040]  You know, I'm neither a rancher or a libertarian, you know, I'm neither, I'm not a veteran
[02:28:05.040 --> 02:28:11.040]  So when they, you know, took their health care away, I didn't care
[02:28:11.040 --> 02:28:19.040]  But, you know, yesterday, Vermont took away the philosophical exemption
[02:28:19.040 --> 02:28:28.040]  And this really strikes, you know, the mainstream population because it affects everyone
[02:28:28.040 --> 02:28:38.040]  And, you know, remember you said that DHS was getting targets of pregnant women
[02:28:38.040 --> 02:28:42.040]  And, you know, like, well, how can you put that together?
[02:28:42.040 --> 02:28:48.040]  Well, you know, when there were 300 of us at the state capitol giving testimony
[02:28:48.040 --> 02:28:58.040]  You could see, you know, how chucks exposed the mothers were when they were giving testimony
[02:28:58.040 --> 02:29:03.040]  And they don't care of 98% of the people that show up in California or Vermont or against forced inoculation
[02:29:03.040 --> 02:29:08.040]  They just do it, and yes, for those that don't know, Vermont just voted to get rid of philosophical exemptions
[02:29:08.040 --> 02:29:12.040]  Saying you're not smart enough to say no, you don't have free will
[02:29:12.040 --> 02:29:17.040]  We're going to let Big Pharma force something into your body
[02:29:17.040 --> 02:29:20.040]  There was amendments, but it got defeated
[02:29:20.040 --> 02:29:24.040]  But some senators actually wanted to jail people
[02:29:24.040 --> 02:29:25.040]  I know
[02:29:25.040 --> 02:29:30.040]  Conveniently would lie to get on the religious exemption
[02:29:30.040 --> 02:29:35.040]  But see, then they're going to phase out the religious, they're coming
[02:29:35.040 --> 02:29:38.040]  I hear you, brother, you want to add something else? Go ahead
[02:29:38.040 --> 02:29:46.040]  But because GMO will allow them, they won't have to rely on fetal tissue any longer
[02:29:46.040 --> 02:29:48.040]  They won't have to rely
[02:29:48.040 --> 02:29:49.040]  Stay there, I'm going to come back to you
[02:29:49.040 --> 02:29:50.040]  The empires
[02:29:50.040 --> 02:29:52.040]  Only what you had to say, and then we're going to go to Alex Jones
[02:29:52.040 --> 02:30:17.040]  Who do you prefer? Barack Obama or George W. Bush?
[02:30:17.040 --> 02:30:23.040]  They both violated the Constitution and they even committed war crimes
[02:30:23.040 --> 02:30:27.040]  So what's it going to take? I mean, what will it take to finally wake you up?
[02:30:27.040 --> 02:30:28.040]  Think about it
[02:30:28.040 --> 02:30:34.040]  If Joseph Stalin ran for president as a Democrat and Adolf Hitler ran as a Republican
[02:30:34.040 --> 02:30:37.040]  One of them would end up leading our country
[02:30:37.040 --> 02:30:41.040]  It's elephants and asses screwing the masses
[02:30:41.040 --> 02:30:45.040]  And your choice between the two parties is a myth
[02:30:45.040 --> 02:30:49.040]  In reality, it is a two-party tyranny with one ideology
[02:30:49.040 --> 02:30:51.040]  Divide and conquer
[02:30:51.040 --> 02:30:56.040]  So join the revolution and break the false left versus right paradigm
[02:30:56.040 --> 02:31:21.040]  Infowars.com

[02:31:38.040 --> 02:31:41.040]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff
[02:31:41.040 --> 02:31:44.040]  Just cover that up for a while, but then burn you out in my experience
[02:31:44.040 --> 02:31:48.040]  Whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source
[02:31:48.040 --> 02:31:50.040]  So it's pretty exciting and I love it

[02:32:03.040 --> 02:32:05.040]  Introducing the new infowarslife.com

[02:32:28.040 --> 02:32:29.040]  Alex Jones here
[02:32:29.040 --> 02:32:33.040]  For the last two years I've been working with top doctors, nutritionist and chemist
[02:32:33.040 --> 02:32:38.040]  To design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life changing health benefits
[02:32:38.040 --> 02:32:42.040]  Introducing the all new ancient defense herbal immunity blend
[02:32:42.040 --> 02:32:47.040]  Experience the benefits of combining over 14 ancient herbs and extracts
[02:32:47.040 --> 02:32:50.040]  With exciting new advances in nutraceutical science
[02:32:50.040 --> 02:32:56.040]  Visit infowarslife.com or call 1-888-253-3139
[02:32:56.040 --> 02:33:23.040]  That's infowarslife.com
[02:33:26.040 --> 02:33:53.040]  We are living in an artificially induced state of consciousness that resembles sleep
[02:33:53.040 --> 02:33:57.040]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center
[02:33:57.040 --> 02:34:00.040]  And the heart of the resistance
[02:34:00.040 --> 02:34:26.040]  We are here Monday through Friday from 11am to 2pm Central
[02:34:26.040 --> 02:34:31.040]  We have the great radio slash TV crew that also helps with the nightly news
[02:34:31.040 --> 02:34:34.040]  There they are in there, we're going to cut to a feed of them
[02:34:34.040 --> 02:34:37.040]  Doing a fabulous job as usual
[02:34:37.040 --> 02:34:41.040]  And they have evil founding USA flags behind them
[02:34:41.040 --> 02:34:46.040]  George Washington and the don't tread on me and our own Molan Labe flag
[02:34:46.040 --> 02:34:53.040]  I just realized we ought to put that gold on black flag and make a flag, a Molan Labe flag
[02:34:53.040 --> 02:34:56.040]  A lot of us have Molan Labe flags that are a rifle or something
[02:34:56.040 --> 02:34:59.040]  But how about with the Spartan helmet
[02:34:59.040 --> 02:35:03.040]  Before we go any further, Anthony's got a bunch of really cool news
[02:35:03.040 --> 02:35:09.040]  Exciting positive news and some negative news on the whole Monsanto roundup front and more
[02:35:09.040 --> 02:35:11.040]  We'll be going to him in about 5-10 minutes
[02:35:11.040 --> 02:35:14.040]  But I wanted to finish up with Ron James, Lawrence Smith and Luke
[02:35:14.040 --> 02:35:18.040]  But here's the deal, I end up talking over the guests and they talk and then we make points
[02:35:18.040 --> 02:35:20.040]  It's very spirited, good discussions
[02:35:20.040 --> 02:35:22.040]  I got to get through these calls to get to the other news I haven't hit yet
[02:35:22.040 --> 02:35:27.040]  Ron and Vermont, you're on the air, finish up your point about them coming with the forced inoculations
[02:35:27.040 --> 02:35:31.040]  And wanting to have amendments, I saw that in the articles I have right here
[02:35:31.040 --> 02:35:36.040]  To arrest people that don't go along with this
[02:35:36.040 --> 02:35:40.040]  And then imagine big companies make you take whatever they want
[02:35:40.040 --> 02:35:44.040]  And they've got liability protection, a hellish recipe
[02:35:44.040 --> 02:35:46.040]  So yes, it is tyranny
[02:35:46.040 --> 02:35:48.040]  But go ahead and finish your point, Ron
[02:35:48.040 --> 02:35:50.040]  Yes, can you hear me?
[02:35:50.040 --> 02:35:52.040]  Sure can
[02:35:52.040 --> 02:35:57.040]  Okay, yeah, you know Catholics take the religious exemption
[02:35:57.040 --> 02:36:02.040]  Because aborted fetal tissue is used to grow some of these cultures
[02:36:02.040 --> 02:36:06.040]  And again, the same is true for the Jewish community
[02:36:06.040 --> 02:36:11.040]  Where the gelatin and the vaccines are used from pigskin and hooves
[02:36:11.040 --> 02:36:14.040]  But with GMO coming down the pike
[02:36:14.040 --> 02:36:18.040]  You know, you're going to see all of that done away with
[02:36:18.040 --> 02:36:21.040]  And then there will be no more reason for religious exemption
[02:36:21.040 --> 02:36:25.040]  No, you can just say that you as a person with your experience with God
[02:36:25.040 --> 02:36:29.040]  Do not trust this and that God's told you not to take it
[02:36:29.040 --> 02:36:31.040]  But you can also just say common sense has told you not to take it
[02:36:31.040 --> 02:36:33.040]  I know they've gotten religious exemption
[02:36:33.040 --> 02:36:36.040]  You need to change those politicians, you need to get involved, you need to remove them
[02:36:36.040 --> 02:36:39.040]  Every time a child gets hurt taking vaccines
[02:36:39.040 --> 02:36:41.040]  Everybody needs to put it on YouTube
[02:36:41.040 --> 02:36:44.040]  We all have to be media activists or we're going to lose everything
[02:36:44.040 --> 02:36:45.040]  That's the thing, thank you, Ron
[02:36:45.040 --> 02:36:48.040]  They're coming for everybody's freedom now
[02:36:48.040 --> 02:36:50.040]  The hammer's dropping
[02:36:50.040 --> 02:36:52.040]  And I told you this four years ago
[02:36:52.040 --> 02:36:55.040]  That we'd look ahead a few years and you wouldn't believe how insane it was
[02:36:55.040 --> 02:36:58.040]  And then two years from now you'll look back
[02:36:58.040 --> 02:37:00.040]  This will be a great time
[02:37:00.040 --> 02:37:04.040]  And then ten years from now it's going to be robot cars almost everywhere
[02:37:04.040 --> 02:37:08.040]  Ten years, it's going to be the whole military, basically robots
[02:37:08.040 --> 02:37:11.040]  But they'll still have human brigades that will be celebrated
[02:37:11.040 --> 02:37:15.040]  So you'll still have this ceremonial humans
[02:37:15.040 --> 02:37:18.040]  So the public won't even know most of our military's robot
[02:37:18.040 --> 02:37:20.040]  Already most of the aircraft are
[02:37:20.040 --> 02:37:22.040]  I mean, I've learned how the enemy operates
[02:37:22.040 --> 02:37:28.040]  Autonomous battle ground robots, you name it
[02:37:28.040 --> 02:37:31.040]  And they keep showing for 15 years, you know
[02:37:31.040 --> 02:37:35.040]  These different MIT robots that are just nothing
[02:37:35.040 --> 02:37:38.040]  You know, that run off lawnmowers and stuff
[02:37:38.040 --> 02:37:42.040]  The real robots are submarines and jets
[02:37:42.040 --> 02:37:44.040]  And fighter bombers
[02:37:44.040 --> 02:37:46.040]  And then they've got for decades
[02:37:46.040 --> 02:37:49.040]  And I was told about classified stuff a long time ago
[02:37:49.040 --> 02:37:53.040]  By a colonel and since then it all came out
[02:37:53.040 --> 02:37:56.040]  Imagine a Ford F-150 Raptor
[02:37:56.040 --> 02:37:59.040]  Okay, I happen to know some of the stuff they've got
[02:37:59.040 --> 02:38:02.040]  Imagine it's got a robot gun in the back
[02:38:02.040 --> 02:38:04.040]  That goes off of heat signatures
[02:38:04.040 --> 02:38:06.040]  Sound, you name it, 50 cal
[02:38:06.040 --> 02:38:09.040]  Can scan, shoot people for miles while it's driving
[02:38:09.040 --> 02:38:11.040]  While it's driving, not aiming, you know
[02:38:11.040 --> 02:38:13.040]  Just boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
[02:38:13.040 --> 02:38:15.040]  And then it looks like a joke
[02:38:15.040 --> 02:38:17.040]  Part of this came out in the Honolulu Advertiser
[02:38:17.040 --> 02:38:18.040]  Whatever it's called a few years ago
[02:38:18.040 --> 02:38:20.040]  It showed one of these, quote, robot tanks
[02:38:20.040 --> 02:38:22.040]  It was just really a truck
[02:38:22.040 --> 02:38:24.040]  And it looked like a joke, like a kid drew it
[02:38:24.040 --> 02:38:27.040]  But it was real, it had like 10 guns on the front
[02:38:27.040 --> 02:38:31.040]  And drones that have like nerve gas
[02:38:31.040 --> 02:38:33.040]  And everything else, just a little drone
[02:38:33.040 --> 02:38:37.040]  Throws up, throws out cans, there's a nerve gas, you're all dead
[02:38:37.040 --> 02:38:40.040]  I mean, it's on folks, it isn't
[02:38:40.040 --> 02:38:44.040]  Robot like Terminator
[02:38:44.040 --> 02:38:51.040]  It is over the top existing platforms
[02:38:51.040 --> 02:38:54.040]  They've got current stuff that's like out of the movie Minority Report
[02:38:54.040 --> 02:38:56.040]  But it's not as elegant as the little spiders
[02:38:56.040 --> 02:38:58.040]  But you're locked up in your house
[02:38:58.040 --> 02:39:01.040]  And a robot that's small that has like eight legs
[02:39:01.040 --> 02:39:03.040]  Up your steps
[02:39:03.040 --> 02:39:06.040]  It walks up to your front step
[02:39:06.040 --> 02:39:09.040]  Targets the door with its shotgun or other systems
[02:39:09.040 --> 02:39:12.040]  Some of them have a laser, it'll just cut a hole for itself
[02:39:12.040 --> 02:39:14.040]  It cuts a hole basically
[02:39:14.040 --> 02:39:16.040]  Some of them have a welding thing as well
[02:39:16.040 --> 02:39:18.040]  It doesn't matter if your house is on fire, it doesn't care
[02:39:18.040 --> 02:39:21.040]  Or it's got an extinguisher, they're doing all sorts of
[02:39:21.040 --> 02:39:23.040]  And it just comes through
[02:39:23.040 --> 02:39:25.040]  It's got a shotgun
[02:39:25.040 --> 02:39:27.040]  I mean, this is the stuff that's going on here
[02:39:27.040 --> 02:39:29.040]  And the humans are done
[02:39:29.040 --> 02:39:31.040]  According to the elite
[02:39:31.040 --> 02:39:33.040]  But here's the thing
[02:39:33.040 --> 02:39:37.040]  These autonomous systems are being hooked into these big battle computers
[02:39:37.040 --> 02:39:40.040]  That are pre-programmed, that are hooked into the larger
[02:39:40.040 --> 02:39:42.040]  They admit, depending on how it has this map of the world
[02:39:42.040 --> 02:39:44.040]  Super computer that's classified
[02:39:44.040 --> 02:39:46.040]  Its existence is admitted, but
[02:39:46.040 --> 02:39:48.040]  It's the one that they basically call the big brain
[02:39:48.040 --> 02:39:50.040]  That is probably sentient
[02:39:50.040 --> 02:39:53.040]  And it's tied into Google and it's running all this stuff
[02:39:53.040 --> 02:39:55.040]  And the smart meters in your house and your car and everything
[02:39:55.040 --> 02:39:58.040]  And Google and NASA and everything's just all emerging
[02:39:58.040 --> 02:40:00.040]  And it's...
[02:40:00.040 --> 02:40:03.040]  I mean, it's sitting there looking at everybody right now
[02:40:03.040 --> 02:40:07.040]  You want to see where its minions are here?
[02:40:07.040 --> 02:40:09.040]  It dials in, it's got all your photos
[02:40:09.040 --> 02:40:11.040]  Where you went, what you did
[02:40:11.040 --> 02:40:14.040]  It can listen to you, it can photograph you, it can videotape you
[02:40:14.040 --> 02:40:16.040]  This is its little node
[02:40:16.040 --> 02:40:18.040]  That you carry in love
[02:40:18.040 --> 02:40:21.040]  And oh, where is my little smart phone
[02:40:21.040 --> 02:40:28.040]  This is it
[02:40:28.040 --> 02:40:30.040]  And they built it
[02:40:30.040 --> 02:40:31.040]  They say what it's for
[02:40:31.040 --> 02:40:33.040]  Bill Joy, again, 15 years ago
[02:40:33.040 --> 02:40:36.040]  Went to a meeting of 200 top computer owners, billionaires
[02:40:36.040 --> 02:40:39.040]  And they had a weekend meeting at a luxury hotel
[02:40:39.040 --> 02:40:41.040]  And overbears, they discussed what do they do with the people
[02:40:41.040 --> 02:40:44.040]  And they said, you know, if we just let people play video games
[02:40:44.040 --> 02:40:46.040]  And play virtual reality games
[02:40:46.040 --> 02:40:47.040]  And they'll still hurt the earth
[02:40:47.040 --> 02:40:48.040]  And it's just the best decisions
[02:40:48.040 --> 02:40:52.040]  Just set up a grid, organize it, entertain them while we kill them
[02:40:52.040 --> 02:40:55.040]  And so you see the whole thing being phased in
[02:40:55.040 --> 02:40:57.040]  I'm going to go to more calls now
[02:40:57.040 --> 02:40:59.040]  James in Texas, you're on the air
[02:40:59.040 --> 02:41:01.040]  Go ahead
[02:41:01.040 --> 02:41:03.040]  Hi Alex, how you doing?
[02:41:03.040 --> 02:41:06.040]  I'm just going to hit a couple quick points here
[02:41:06.040 --> 02:41:08.040]  I know you're crunched on time
[02:41:08.040 --> 02:41:10.040]  I'm an Army reservist
[02:41:10.040 --> 02:41:12.040]  And I work in psychological operations
[02:41:12.040 --> 02:41:16.040]  You know, I'm somewhat abreast of the operation J-Helm
[02:41:16.040 --> 02:41:18.040]  By the way, I'm going to apologize
[02:41:18.040 --> 02:41:21.040]  Because I don't really read what's out by people's names
[02:41:21.040 --> 02:41:22.040]  And people volunteer it
[02:41:22.040 --> 02:41:24.040]  I thought you wanted to talk about Army Psyops
[02:41:24.040 --> 02:41:26.040]  I didn't know you were in a Psyop group
[02:41:26.040 --> 02:41:28.040]  And I apologize for making you hold for 50 minutes
[02:41:28.040 --> 02:41:30.040]  So James, you've got the floor
[02:41:30.040 --> 02:41:34.040]  What type of Psyops are you in?
[02:41:34.040 --> 02:41:38.040]  Well, I'm in psychological operations with the U.S. Army
[02:41:38.040 --> 02:41:42.040]  It's more specifically known as a Psyop specialist
[02:41:42.040 --> 02:41:43.040]  It's the job title
[02:41:43.040 --> 02:41:44.040]  I know what it is
[02:41:44.040 --> 02:41:47.040]  I'm saying specifically they got you working on domestic stuff
[02:41:47.040 --> 02:41:49.040]  Or foreign stuff now
[02:41:49.040 --> 02:41:50.040]  It's foreign
[02:41:50.040 --> 02:41:52.040]  I'm in a reserve unit
[02:41:52.040 --> 02:41:55.040]  Okay, so go ahead and give us your take on J-Helm
[02:41:55.040 --> 02:42:00.040]  Well, in J-Helm, I don't know the exact orders
[02:42:00.040 --> 02:42:02.040]  They're being given for their mission objective
[02:42:02.040 --> 02:42:04.040]  But the way psychological operation works
[02:42:04.040 --> 02:42:05.040]  As you probably already know this
[02:42:05.040 --> 02:42:07.040]  You've read all the Army manuals
[02:42:07.040 --> 02:42:10.040]  It's all public knowledge
[02:42:10.040 --> 02:42:15.040]  The main mission objective is to gather information
[02:42:15.040 --> 02:42:17.040]  I.e. intelligence
[02:42:17.040 --> 02:42:21.040]  And to use that information later on in your mission
[02:42:21.040 --> 02:42:25.040]  To use all pertinent information that was gathered
[02:42:25.040 --> 02:42:28.040]  From your target audience
[02:42:28.040 --> 02:42:31.040]  In this situation, the target audience
[02:42:31.040 --> 02:42:34.040]  Would be the American people, obviously
[02:42:34.040 --> 02:42:37.040]  But as I was saying
[02:42:37.040 --> 02:42:41.040]  On multiple field exercises
[02:42:41.040 --> 02:42:46.040]  I haven't been deployed on any specific mission
[02:42:46.040 --> 02:42:48.040]  But I probably wouldn't tell you anyways
[02:42:48.040 --> 02:42:54.040]  But the exercises we're doing are almost identical
[02:42:54.040 --> 02:42:57.040]  To the news I've been hearing about J-Helm
[02:42:57.040 --> 02:42:58.040]  That's what I've been saying
[02:42:58.040 --> 02:43:01.040]  J-Helm is just one big 10-state operation
[02:43:01.040 --> 02:43:03.040]  They're already clearly going on simultaneously
[02:43:03.040 --> 02:43:05.040]  All over the country
[02:43:05.040 --> 02:43:07.040]  Yeah, exactly
[02:43:07.040 --> 02:43:12.040]  It's actually referred to as scenario training exercises
[02:43:12.040 --> 02:43:14.040]  In which there's an invading force
[02:43:14.040 --> 02:43:17.040]  Such as special forces or infantry
[02:43:17.040 --> 02:43:20.040]  And a small team of psychological operators
[02:43:20.040 --> 02:43:22.040]  Are attached to that team
[02:43:22.040 --> 02:43:26.040]  Special forces are also trained in psychological operations
[02:43:26.040 --> 02:43:28.040]  And it can be a reasonable mission
[02:43:28.040 --> 02:43:29.040]  But the larger unspoken mission
[02:43:29.040 --> 02:43:30.040]  That the troops might not even know
[02:43:30.040 --> 02:43:32.040]  Is to acclimate the locals
[02:43:32.040 --> 02:43:33.040]  Are you guys aware of that
[02:43:33.040 --> 02:43:36.040]  What is your view of J-Helm?
[02:43:36.040 --> 02:43:40.040]  Well, see, my view of J-Helm is
[02:43:40.040 --> 02:43:43.040]  What they're doing is
[02:43:43.040 --> 02:43:45.040]  They're placing these troops
[02:43:45.040 --> 02:43:46.040]  Among civilians
[02:43:46.040 --> 02:43:49.040]  So they have a more realistic training environment
[02:43:49.040 --> 02:43:52.040]  I don't know exactly
[02:43:52.040 --> 02:43:54.040]  Why they're trying to acclimate troops
[02:43:54.040 --> 02:43:56.040]  To the American public
[02:43:56.040 --> 02:43:58.040]  If they are trying to take on the American public
[02:43:58.040 --> 02:43:59.040]  Or not
[02:43:59.040 --> 02:44:02.040]  I'm not sure why Socom decided to
[02:44:02.040 --> 02:44:03.040]  Run with this mission
[02:44:03.040 --> 02:44:05.040]  In the manner that they have
[02:44:05.040 --> 02:44:07.040]  But as I said before
[02:44:07.040 --> 02:44:10.040]  Their main objective is to
[02:44:10.040 --> 02:44:13.040]  Their focus is the target audience
[02:44:13.040 --> 02:44:14.040]  And in this situation
[02:44:14.040 --> 02:44:16.040]  The target audience is the American people
[02:44:16.040 --> 02:44:19.040]  Because they have soldiers, operators
[02:44:19.040 --> 02:44:21.040]  Out in the public
[02:44:21.040 --> 02:44:24.040]  Who are in sterile uniforms
[02:44:24.040 --> 02:44:27.040]  They're completely unrecognizable
[02:44:27.040 --> 02:44:29.040]  As soldiers or operators
[02:44:29.040 --> 02:44:32.040]  And they're basically going around
[02:44:32.040 --> 02:44:35.040]  And probably questioning people
[02:44:35.040 --> 02:44:39.040]  Trying to strike up a normal conversation
[02:44:39.040 --> 02:44:42.040]  Just taking notes on people's everyday lives
[02:44:42.040 --> 02:44:45.040]  But as I said, I don't know any exact details
[02:44:45.040 --> 02:44:46.040]  They're training them to be comfortable
[02:44:46.040 --> 02:44:48.040]  Working with the local police and others
[02:44:48.040 --> 02:44:49.040]  And then selling the scythe
[02:44:49.040 --> 02:44:50.040]  That it's for overseas
[02:44:50.040 --> 02:44:52.040]  When obviously it's dual use
[02:44:52.040 --> 02:44:55.040]  But we know from the training operations
[02:44:55.040 --> 02:44:56.040]  We've exposed
[02:44:56.040 --> 02:44:57.040]  That they are in some of these training
[02:44:57.040 --> 02:45:00.040]  To take on militias, American gun owners
[02:45:00.040 --> 02:45:02.040]  I found out one of the most popular things
[02:45:02.040 --> 02:45:04.040]  Is ROTC with the officers
[02:45:04.040 --> 02:45:06.040]  Or people that are going to be officers
[02:45:06.040 --> 02:45:09.040]  That they quote, take on a militia
[02:45:09.040 --> 02:45:11.040]  And that's generally played by
[02:45:11.040 --> 02:45:13.040]  National Guard or active duty
[02:45:13.040 --> 02:45:14.040]  In fact, I know that happened
[02:45:14.040 --> 02:45:15.040]  Just a few years ago down in San Antonio
[02:45:15.040 --> 02:45:16.040]  One operation
[02:45:16.040 --> 02:45:18.040]  So that's my issue
[02:45:18.040 --> 02:45:19.040]  Have you seen all the news articles
[02:45:19.040 --> 02:45:20.040]  Where the military is training
[02:45:20.040 --> 02:45:21.040]  To take on the Tea Party
[02:45:21.040 --> 02:45:24.040]  And all those headlines?
[02:45:24.040 --> 02:45:25.040]  I have, Alex
[02:45:25.040 --> 02:45:28.040]  You know, I'm not too sure
[02:45:28.040 --> 02:45:29.040]  How I feel about that
[02:45:29.040 --> 02:45:30.040]  As a reservist
[02:45:30.040 --> 02:45:32.040]  I've contemplated going active duty
[02:45:32.040 --> 02:45:33.040]  And, you know
[02:45:33.040 --> 02:45:35.040]  I'm not really too keen on
[02:45:35.040 --> 02:45:36.040]  What's going on right now
[02:45:36.040 --> 02:45:38.040]  I'm not really sure if I want to pursue
[02:45:38.040 --> 02:45:40.040]  A career in such a...
[02:45:40.040 --> 02:45:41.040]  Sure
[02:45:41.040 --> 02:45:43.040]  What's your bottom line?
[02:45:43.040 --> 02:45:44.040]  What else do you want to get out?
[02:45:44.040 --> 02:45:46.040]  I mean, the reason you called
[02:45:46.040 --> 02:45:48.040]  Into the show
[02:45:48.040 --> 02:45:50.040]  Well, that really was my main point
[02:45:50.040 --> 02:45:52.040]  You know, they use...
[02:45:52.040 --> 02:45:54.040]  They use what they call
[02:45:54.040 --> 02:45:56.040]  In training exercises
[02:45:56.040 --> 02:45:57.040]  They use OP4
[02:45:57.040 --> 02:45:59.040]  Individuals who are playing
[02:45:59.040 --> 02:46:02.040]  As role players
[02:46:02.040 --> 02:46:05.040]  And in these training exercises
[02:46:05.040 --> 02:46:07.040]  Like I said before
[02:46:07.040 --> 02:46:09.040]  It's all scenario playing
[02:46:09.040 --> 02:46:11.040]  But this isn't a scenario
[02:46:11.040 --> 02:46:13.040]  This is they're actually training
[02:46:13.040 --> 02:46:14.040]  Among real people
[02:46:14.040 --> 02:46:15.040]  So this is the real deal
[02:46:15.040 --> 02:46:17.040]  Like you said before
[02:46:17.040 --> 02:46:19.040]  And people need to take this seriously
[02:46:19.040 --> 02:46:21.040]  You know, they need to not be
[02:46:21.040 --> 02:46:22.040]  Not be vulnerable sheep
[02:46:22.040 --> 02:46:24.040]  They need to pay attention
[02:46:24.040 --> 02:46:25.040]  To their surroundings
[02:46:25.040 --> 02:46:27.040]  Really focus in
[02:46:27.040 --> 02:46:29.040]  On strange-looking characters
[02:46:29.040 --> 02:46:30.040]  You know, really
[02:46:30.040 --> 02:46:31.040]  Try to pay attention
[02:46:31.040 --> 02:46:33.040]  To details and conversations
[02:46:33.040 --> 02:46:34.040]  Someone comes up to you
[02:46:34.040 --> 02:46:35.040]  And starts asking you
[02:46:35.040 --> 02:46:37.040]  You know, a bunch of questions about
[02:46:37.040 --> 02:46:39.040]  Your daily routines about
[02:46:39.040 --> 02:46:42.040]  Say
[02:46:42.040 --> 02:46:44.040]  Your...
[02:46:44.040 --> 02:46:46.040]  If you're an ownership of a
[02:46:46.040 --> 02:46:47.040]  Firearms or anything like that
[02:46:47.040 --> 02:46:49.040]  You know, just really pay attention to that
[02:46:49.040 --> 02:46:50.040]  Yup
[02:46:50.040 --> 02:46:52.040]  Well, I tell you, this is blowing up
[02:46:52.040 --> 02:46:53.040]  In their face
[02:46:53.040 --> 02:46:55.040]  This is blowing up in their face
[02:46:55.040 --> 02:46:56.040]  And it's really meant to condition
[02:46:56.040 --> 02:46:57.040]  The military to accept this
[02:46:57.040 --> 02:46:59.040]  And to gauge who will do this
[02:46:59.040 --> 02:47:01.040]  In the military
[02:47:01.040 --> 02:47:02.040]  And I don't know exactly
[02:47:02.040 --> 02:47:03.040]  Everything they're going to pull
[02:47:03.040 --> 02:47:04.040]  Is it's so big and so long
[02:47:04.040 --> 02:47:05.040]  But I know this
[02:47:05.040 --> 02:47:06.040]  Over and over again
[02:47:06.040 --> 02:47:08.040]  They use drills as the
[02:47:08.040 --> 02:47:11.040]  Smoke screen to carry out real operations
[02:47:11.040 --> 02:47:12.040]  Which they then false flag
[02:47:12.040 --> 02:47:14.040]  And blame the Patriots
[02:47:14.040 --> 02:47:16.040]  And so this could be
[02:47:16.040 --> 02:47:18.040]  A cover for something larger
[02:47:18.040 --> 02:47:21.040]  What do you have to say to that?
[02:47:21.040 --> 02:47:22.040]  Roger that, yeah
[02:47:22.040 --> 02:47:23.040]  That makes complete sense
[02:47:23.040 --> 02:47:25.040]  A lot of times they will use that
[02:47:25.040 --> 02:47:27.040]  The military will use smoke screen
[02:47:27.040 --> 02:47:30.040]  Tactics as a false flag
[02:47:30.040 --> 02:47:31.040]  Like you said
[02:47:31.040 --> 02:47:32.040]  Especially in the world
[02:47:32.040 --> 02:47:34.040]  Of special operations
[02:47:34.040 --> 02:47:35.040]  You know, I'm just a low level grunt
[02:47:35.040 --> 02:47:37.040]  But I read a lot of
[02:47:37.040 --> 02:47:39.040]  I'm fairly abreast on the literature
[02:47:39.040 --> 02:47:43.040]  Of former special operations
[02:47:43.040 --> 02:47:44.040]  That have been conducted
[02:47:44.040 --> 02:47:45.040]  Throughout the world
[02:47:45.040 --> 02:47:47.040]  And that is a common tactic
[02:47:47.040 --> 02:47:48.040]  That is used
[02:47:48.040 --> 02:47:49.040]  It's in the army
[02:47:49.040 --> 02:47:51.040]  It's in the army
[02:47:51.040 --> 02:47:53.040]  Special operations training manual
[02:47:53.040 --> 02:47:54.040]  That WikiLeaks released
[02:47:54.040 --> 02:47:55.040]  Which they said was real
[02:47:55.040 --> 02:47:56.040]  And they want them
[02:47:56.040 --> 02:47:58.040]  Trying to indict the folks involved in it
[02:47:58.040 --> 02:48:00.040]  And it says, you know, go here
[02:48:00.040 --> 02:48:03.040]  And take this class in false flags
[02:48:03.040 --> 02:48:05.040]  So they have a false flag class
[02:48:05.040 --> 02:48:06.040]  At the army
[02:48:06.040 --> 02:48:07.040]  And I don't need to be told about it
[02:48:07.040 --> 02:48:09.040]  I had family that told me about this stuff
[02:48:09.040 --> 02:48:10.040]  From multiple angles
[02:48:10.040 --> 02:48:13.040]  And I mean, let's just say this
[02:48:13.040 --> 02:48:14.040]  There's a public assistant
[02:48:14.040 --> 02:48:15.040]  Ready to handle all this
[02:48:15.040 --> 02:48:17.040]  I'll tell you, God bless you
[02:48:17.040 --> 02:48:18.040]  I appreciate your call
[02:48:18.040 --> 02:48:20.040]  All I know is it's ramping up
[02:48:20.040 --> 02:48:21.040]  It's aimed at us
[02:48:21.040 --> 02:48:22.040]  And that ain't good
[02:48:22.040 --> 02:48:23.040]  I mean, I'm against aiming it
[02:48:23.040 --> 02:48:24.040]  At innocent countries
[02:48:24.040 --> 02:48:25.040]  That didn't do anything to us
[02:48:25.040 --> 02:48:26.040]  Like Iraq
[02:48:26.040 --> 02:48:27.040]  I can't believe Jeb Bush came out
[02:48:27.040 --> 02:48:29.040]  And said he'd do Iraq all over again
[02:48:29.040 --> 02:48:31.040]  Iraq did nothing to us
[02:48:31.040 --> 02:48:33.040]  Our government put Saddam in
[02:48:33.040 --> 02:48:35.040]  Our government had Saddam attack Iran
[02:48:35.040 --> 02:48:37.040]  Saddam had women in college
[02:48:37.040 --> 02:48:38.040]  And Playboy
[02:48:38.040 --> 02:48:40.040]  I'm not saying Playboy's good
[02:48:40.040 --> 02:48:43.040]  But I mean, they were free compared
[02:48:43.040 --> 02:48:45.040]  Saddam could go stand in front of 15,000 people
[02:48:45.040 --> 02:48:47.040]  With AK-47s
[02:48:47.040 --> 02:48:49.040]  Any citizen that wanted guns could have them
[02:48:49.040 --> 02:48:52.040]  And when Iran or Saudi Arabia
[02:48:52.040 --> 02:48:53.040]  Tried to send in operatives
[02:48:53.040 --> 02:48:54.040]  To take over Iraq
[02:48:54.040 --> 02:48:56.040]  He'd round them up and kill them
[02:48:56.040 --> 02:48:57.040]  I'm not saying that's good
[02:48:57.040 --> 02:48:58.040]  But let me tell you
[02:48:58.040 --> 02:48:59.040]  Compared to everybody else
[02:48:59.040 --> 02:49:01.040]  Saddam was a cupcake
[02:49:01.040 --> 02:49:04.040]  And now look what you got going on
[02:49:04.040 --> 02:49:06.040]  Anthony Gutiarty joins us
[02:49:06.040 --> 02:49:07.040]  I'm going to go into overdrive
[02:49:07.040 --> 02:49:09.040]  To talk to Luke and Smith
[02:49:09.040 --> 02:49:11.040]  And Lauren and Brandon
[02:49:11.040 --> 02:49:12.040]  I'll get to everybody
[02:49:12.040 --> 02:49:14.040]  You've got some really exciting news
[02:49:14.040 --> 02:49:16.040]  To break down with us
[02:49:16.040 --> 02:49:17.040]  On the Monsanto and other fronts
[02:49:17.040 --> 02:49:19.040]  Tell us about some of those articles
[02:49:19.040 --> 02:49:20.040]  That are coming up
[02:49:20.040 --> 02:49:21.040]  It's so insane
[02:49:21.040 --> 02:49:22.040]  Because just like you were saying
[02:49:22.040 --> 02:49:24.040]  The attack right now is so incognito
[02:49:24.040 --> 02:49:25.040]  And so concise
[02:49:25.040 --> 02:49:26.040]  That most people don't get it
[02:49:26.040 --> 02:49:27.040]  They just don't think like that
[02:49:27.040 --> 02:49:28.040]  They don't think
[02:49:28.040 --> 02:49:30.040]  Just in the realm of glyphosate
[02:49:30.040 --> 02:49:31.040]  Monsanto's chemical
[02:49:31.040 --> 02:49:32.040]  And their number one
[02:49:32.040 --> 02:49:34.040]  Best-selling herbicide roundup
[02:49:34.040 --> 02:49:36.040]  They don't think in the way that
[02:49:36.040 --> 02:49:38.040]  Even the World Health Organization
[02:49:38.040 --> 02:49:39.040]  Researchers did when they said
[02:49:39.040 --> 02:49:40.040]  Hey, we're going to go against
[02:49:40.040 --> 02:49:42.040]  The World Health Organization
[02:49:42.040 --> 02:49:43.040]  A branch of it went
[02:49:43.040 --> 02:49:44.040]  And they researched it
[02:49:44.040 --> 02:49:45.040]  And they found that it was
[02:49:45.040 --> 02:49:46.040]  Indeed causing cancer
[02:49:46.040 --> 02:49:47.040]  Massive
[02:49:47.040 --> 02:49:48.040]  They've now done humans' tests
[02:49:48.040 --> 02:49:49.040]  They've now done the tests
[02:49:49.040 --> 02:49:50.040]  They've done the research
[02:49:50.040 --> 02:49:51.040]  They've made the announcement
[02:49:51.040 --> 02:49:53.040]  It is causing cancer
[02:49:53.040 --> 02:49:54.040]  Mainstream media was forced to admit it
[02:49:54.040 --> 02:49:56.040]  And the result is
[02:49:56.040 --> 02:49:57.040]  Cities now
[02:49:57.040 --> 02:49:58.040]  Countries, you name it
[02:49:58.040 --> 02:49:59.040]  Are banning glyphosate
[02:49:59.040 --> 02:50:00.040]  Countries every day or two
[02:50:00.040 --> 02:50:01.040]  Yep
[02:50:01.040 --> 02:50:03.040]  And Bermuda is the latest one
[02:50:03.040 --> 02:50:04.040]  And Bermuda suspends
[02:50:04.040 --> 02:50:06.040]  Glyphosate-ridden roundup indefinitely
[02:50:06.040 --> 02:50:08.040]  And the announcement was effective
[02:50:08.040 --> 02:50:10.040]  Immediately all importers of
[02:50:10.040 --> 02:50:11.040]  Glyphosate will be notified
[02:50:11.040 --> 02:50:12.040]  That the approval for glyphosate
[02:50:12.040 --> 02:50:14.040]  Products have been suspended
[02:50:14.040 --> 02:50:15.040]  Pending the continued assessment
[02:50:15.040 --> 02:50:16.040]  Of emerging research
[02:50:16.040 --> 02:50:17.040]  And let's explain
[02:50:17.040 --> 02:50:18.040]  This isn't like a little bit of lead
[02:50:18.040 --> 02:50:19.040]  Can give you cancer
[02:50:19.040 --> 02:50:20.040]  And then they hype it up and ban
[02:50:20.040 --> 02:50:21.040]  You know, some piece of furniture
[02:50:21.040 --> 02:50:22.040]  And it's all fake
[02:50:22.040 --> 02:50:24.040]  This is bound to the pain or something
[02:50:24.040 --> 02:50:27.040]  This is in all water supplies
[02:50:27.040 --> 02:50:28.040]  In the U.S.
[02:50:28.040 --> 02:50:30.040]  It does give you cancer
[02:50:30.040 --> 02:50:31.040]  It grows breast tumors
[02:50:31.040 --> 02:50:32.040]  If you want to see your wife
[02:50:32.040 --> 02:50:33.040]  And daughters die
[02:50:33.040 --> 02:50:35.040]  You don't keep drinking it
[02:50:35.040 --> 02:50:36.040]  It's even in New York City
[02:50:36.040 --> 02:50:37.040]  In Central Park
[02:50:37.040 --> 02:50:38.040]  They were finding all these people
[02:50:38.040 --> 02:50:39.040]  Were getting cancer
[02:50:39.040 --> 02:50:40.040]  They didn't know why
[02:50:40.040 --> 02:50:41.040]  They were spraying it
[02:50:41.040 --> 02:50:42.040]  With roundup and glyphosate
[02:50:42.040 --> 02:50:43.040]  Over and over again
[02:50:43.040 --> 02:50:44.040]  And people walking in the park
[02:50:44.040 --> 02:50:45.040]  Were getting sick
[02:50:45.040 --> 02:50:46.040]  Well, these are the folks
[02:50:46.040 --> 02:50:47.040]  That created Agent Orange
[02:50:47.040 --> 02:50:48.040]  Oh, absolutely
[02:50:48.040 --> 02:50:49.040]  And, of course, the big secret is
[02:50:49.040 --> 02:50:50.040]  They knew they were adding
[02:50:50.040 --> 02:50:51.040]  Actually adding
[02:50:51.040 --> 02:50:52.040]  This was declassified
[02:50:52.040 --> 02:50:53.040]  I had a general on about it
[02:50:53.040 --> 02:50:55.040]  They were adding nerve toxins to it
[02:50:55.040 --> 02:50:57.040]  It was actually a nerve gas
[02:50:57.040 --> 02:50:58.040]  It wasn't really for plants
[02:50:58.040 --> 02:51:00.040]  On the average, Americans worked
[02:51:00.040 --> 02:51:01.040]  Between 45 to 50 years
[02:51:01.040 --> 02:51:03.040]  Hoping to build up enough wealth
[02:51:03.040 --> 02:51:05.040]  To retire and live out their golden years
[02:51:05.040 --> 02:51:07.040]  Unfortunately, with taxation
[02:51:07.040 --> 02:51:09.040]  The rising cost of food, energy, housing
[02:51:09.040 --> 02:51:11.040]  And medical, many retirees
[02:51:11.040 --> 02:51:13.040]  Are forced to live below the poverty line
[02:51:13.040 --> 02:51:15.040]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise?
[02:51:15.040 --> 02:51:16.040]  Or is our monetary unit
[02:51:16.040 --> 02:51:17.040]  We call the Federal Reserve Note
[02:51:17.040 --> 02:51:19.040]  Forcing us into perpetual debt
[02:51:19.040 --> 02:51:21.040]  Ensuring inflation and higher taxes
[02:51:21.040 --> 02:51:23.040]  These questions and more can be answered
[02:51:23.040 --> 02:51:25.040]  By reading G. Edward Griffin's book
[02:51:25.040 --> 02:51:26.040]  The Creature from Jekyll Island
[02:51:26.040 --> 02:51:28.040]  Congressman Ron Paul states
[02:51:28.040 --> 02:51:30.040]  It's what every American needs to know
[02:51:30.040 --> 02:51:32.040]  About central bank power
[02:51:32.040 --> 02:51:34.040]  A gripping adventure into the secret world
[02:51:34.040 --> 02:51:36.040]  Of international banking cartel

[02:51:57.040 --> 02:51:59.040]  Last year, in the Nevada desert
[02:51:59.040 --> 02:52:01.040]  One family took a stand for freedom
[02:52:01.040 --> 02:52:03.040]  New Man of Food storage was the first

[02:54:09.040 --> 02:54:12.040]  I was thinking about how opera singers

[02:54:46.040 --> 02:54:47.040]  We'll feel ugly.
[02:54:47.040 --> 02:54:41.040] crowd
[02:54:41.040 --> 02:54:52.040]  We'll feel empty.
[02:54:52.040 --> 02:55:02.540]  It's the global pushes on because it's in the TPP treaty force inoculations vaccinate all children act does not contain exemptions for reasons of conscience or religion.
[02:55:02.640 --> 02:55:08.540]  It's just national forced inoculation because they want to help the children.
[02:55:08.740 --> 02:55:10.640]  We had that nurse on at the big hospital.
[02:55:11.040 --> 02:55:13.640]  They go, all right, we got 70 premies in there.
[02:55:14.340 --> 02:55:17.540]  The orders give them all shots for the bio board, the bio ethics board.
[02:55:17.540 --> 02:55:23.540]  They say, all right, get the emergency teams ready, prepare, get the defibrillators, get the innovators ready, they're going to start dying.
[02:55:23.840 --> 02:55:28.540]  They give them a shot within 10 minutes, convulsions, blood coming out of the nose, and they battle to save them.
[02:55:28.840 --> 02:55:31.040]  It's like cutting your leg off and giving you a tourniquet.
[02:55:33.840 --> 02:55:44.040]  The government loves you, but Marco Rubio, Anthony, he says that there's there's no NSA spying, none.
[02:55:44.040 --> 02:55:57.540]  He said it, by the way, we have a Monsanto, one of their top lobbyists who says he's not a lobbyist either up in Canada, saying he drink glyphosate, but then saying, actually, I won't.
[02:55:57.740 --> 02:55:58.840]  So here's that clip.
[02:56:00.340 --> 02:56:05.140]  Do not believe that glyphosate in Argentina is causing increases in cancer.
[02:56:05.340 --> 02:56:07.540]  You can drink a whole quart of it and it won't hurt.
[02:56:08.540 --> 02:56:09.640]  You want to drink some?
[02:56:09.640 --> 02:56:10.440]  We have some here.
[02:56:10.440 --> 02:56:13.940]  I'd be happy to actually, not not really, but not really.
[02:56:13.940 --> 02:56:14.940]  I know it wouldn't hurt me.
[02:56:14.940 --> 02:56:17.440]  If you say so, I have some glyphosate.
[02:56:17.440 --> 02:56:18.440]  No, I'm not stupid.
[02:56:18.740 --> 02:56:19.240]  Oh, okay.
[02:56:19.240 --> 02:56:21.440]  So you, you, you know, I know it's dangerous.
[02:56:21.440 --> 02:56:25.240]  No, people try to commit suicide with it and fail fairly regularly.
[02:56:25.640 --> 02:56:28.240]  Oh, they fairly regularly fail in India.
[02:56:28.240 --> 02:56:28.640]  No, not.
[02:56:28.640 --> 02:56:31.040]  So are you ready to drink one glass of glyphosate?
[02:56:31.040 --> 02:56:31.840]  No, I'm not an idiot.
[02:56:32.640 --> 02:56:34.240]  Interview me about golden rice.
[02:56:34.240 --> 02:56:35.540]  That's what I'm talking about.
[02:56:35.740 --> 02:56:36.740]  Okay, then it's finished.
[02:56:36.740 --> 02:56:38.440]  Then the interview is finished.
[02:56:38.840 --> 02:56:40.640]  That's a good way to solve things.
[02:56:40.640 --> 02:56:41.040]  Yeah.
[02:56:41.040 --> 02:56:42.840]  Here, complete.
[02:56:42.840 --> 02:56:43.840]  I'm checking out the nose.
[02:56:44.040 --> 02:56:46.040]  Anyways, that's the guy that popped your eyes.
[02:56:46.040 --> 02:56:47.040]  You can drink it.
[02:56:47.440 --> 02:56:50.840]  He goes, you know, people fairly regularly survive drinking a cup.
[02:56:50.840 --> 02:56:51.640]  Wow.
[02:56:51.640 --> 02:56:52.340]  They, wow.
[02:56:52.340 --> 02:56:55.440]  You sometimes you live that, that doesn't sound bad at all.
[02:56:55.440 --> 02:56:55.840]  Yeah.
[02:56:56.240 --> 02:56:56.740]  Wow.
[02:56:58.840 --> 02:56:59.340]  Sorry.
[02:57:00.540 --> 02:57:01.640]  I think I'm going crazy.
[02:57:03.840 --> 02:57:07.940]  I really, this is just, I mean, how much more, the thing is it gets more insane every day, Anthony.
[02:57:08.240 --> 02:57:09.340]  Well, that's how they win.
[02:57:09.340 --> 02:57:11.940]  If it's so insane, it's normal.
[02:57:12.240 --> 02:57:15.540]  It's so insane that your brain can't handle it that you just accept it.
[02:57:15.940 --> 02:57:27.440]  Just like that guy saying he'll drink a whole glass of it when he knows fairly well that fairly regularly people survive by trying to kill themselves every 30 minutes in India because Monsanto goes over there, gets on the sign contracts.
[02:57:27.440 --> 02:57:29.740]  The Indian farmers says you'll make so much money.
[02:57:29.740 --> 02:57:30.940]  You'll have so many yields.
[02:57:31.040 --> 02:57:33.040]  The Indian farmers make no money.
[02:57:33.140 --> 02:57:33.940]  They're poor.
[02:57:33.940 --> 02:57:34.540]  They're in debt.
[02:57:34.540 --> 02:57:35.940]  And then it's a smart way to rebel.
[02:57:35.940 --> 02:57:37.240]  It's like burning yourself alive.
[02:57:37.240 --> 02:57:38.340]  They drink it and it kills them.
[02:57:38.340 --> 02:57:39.040]  They have honor.
[02:57:39.040 --> 02:57:43.940]  So they go ahead and they take the same biopesticides they were given of the roundup and they drink it and they kill in their family.
[02:57:43.940 --> 02:57:45.040]  Everybody gets sick in the village.
[02:57:45.040 --> 02:57:45.340]  Yep.
[02:57:45.440 --> 02:57:51.940]  And I would change his quote to people eat this fairly regularly and don't die because we're eating it every day.
[02:57:52.040 --> 02:57:53.340]  Now the honeybees die when they go.
[02:57:53.340 --> 02:57:54.040]  But it's okay.
[02:57:54.040 --> 02:57:54.640]  Who needs them?
[02:57:54.640 --> 02:57:55.540]  They're racist.
[02:57:55.540 --> 02:58:03.640]  I mean, you know, they're racist and we're bad too because we eat it and ultimately get cancer, but it's hard to prove a long term thing like that.
[02:58:03.640 --> 02:58:09.140]  But they just had a big study out of Europe where they did the town that uses it, but they had towns that didn't and like cancer was like triple.
[02:58:09.140 --> 02:58:09.940]  Oh, yeah.
[02:58:09.940 --> 02:58:11.140]  Well, we know it's causing cancer.
[02:58:11.140 --> 02:58:12.440]  The World Health Organization.
[02:58:12.440 --> 02:58:14.440]  We're going to go to Baray and come back and go to your phone calls.
[02:58:14.440 --> 02:58:15.340]  Just ride shotgun Anthony.
[02:58:15.340 --> 02:58:16.440]  You got a bunch of news with us.
[02:58:16.440 --> 02:58:18.240]  Some stations don't carry the fourth hour.
[02:58:18.240 --> 02:58:18.640]  Some do.
[02:58:18.640 --> 02:58:19.340]  We love you all.

[02:58:27.340 --> 02:58:30.240]  We're being attacked by the globalists because we're dead on.
[02:58:30.240 --> 02:58:31.440]  We are over the enemy.
[02:58:31.440 --> 02:58:33.040]  We are dropping info bombs.
[02:58:33.040 --> 02:58:34.740]  We are devastating.

[02:58:58.940 --> 02:59:06.040]  My favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade grown Arabica beans.
[02:59:06.040 --> 02:59:17.740]  We have now managed to secure the sought after beans in a highly customized blend discover and try a bag of the Patriot blend 100% organic coffee at info wars life dot com.

[03:00:05.340 --> 03:00:07.540]  The information war continues.
[03:00:07.540 --> 03:00:11.140]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[03:00:11.140 --> 03:00:15.340]  I want to take some of your phone calls interspersed with a bunch of medical and economic news.
[03:00:15.340 --> 03:00:21.440]  I haven't gotten HBS warrants H SBC warrants the global economy hits a Titanic problem.
[03:00:21.440 --> 03:00:24.940]  I'll hit that at least we're taking your calls today.
[03:00:24.940 --> 03:00:26.740]  Luke in Arizona.
[03:00:26.740 --> 03:00:32.040]  Luke I am your father Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father.
[03:00:32.040 --> 03:00:33.940]  This is CNN.
[03:00:33.940 --> 03:00:35.840]  Actually, it's not 10 for wars.
[03:00:35.840 --> 03:00:37.940]  This is info wars.
[03:00:37.940 --> 03:00:38.540]  Go ahead, Luke.
[03:00:38.540 --> 03:00:40.040]  You're on the air.
[03:00:40.040 --> 03:00:50.540]  Thank you sir. I had a theory about jade helm that I just wanted to share and it's one of these things that kind of gives an explanation and sort of gives an overarching idea what's going on and maybe just a solution.
[03:00:50.540 --> 03:01:03.340]  Also, I think a lot of jade helm, especially in the stuff that's ramping up right now in America is because and I know this is going to sound a little weird, but it's because of, for instance, things like the SDR in the in the IMF.
[03:01:03.340 --> 03:01:11.140]  We've always known that they want this kind of one world currency and that they were kind of batting it back and forth as to how much it was going to be backed up by gold.
[03:01:11.140 --> 03:01:17.640]  But in order to back something up by gold, you also have to have not only the gold, but you have to be in control of the gold supply.
[03:01:17.640 --> 03:01:21.740]  So China China basically was in control of Africa.
[03:01:21.740 --> 03:01:24.840]  That's pretty much the largest gold supplier there was.
[03:01:24.840 --> 03:01:28.340]  They obviously had infiltrated the entire area.
[03:01:28.340 --> 03:01:34.540]  And then the next thing we know people, not really people, excuse me, AFRICOM wants to come in and take over.
[03:01:34.540 --> 03:01:38.440]  Well, there's no doubt that's what that's all about.
[03:01:38.440 --> 03:01:52.540]  But look, dictators love to hyperinflate currencies, buy everything up when it still has value, then flee the country after collapses, you know, and watch the country be basically sinking to despotism and in total tyranny from afar.
[03:01:52.540 --> 03:01:59.140]  The globalist are hyperinflating worldwide and then out of that implosion, they will bring in the new SDR global government.
[03:01:59.140 --> 03:02:00.440]  That's all been announced.
[03:02:00.440 --> 03:02:02.140]  Very goldwater exposed that in the 70s.
[03:02:02.140 --> 03:02:13.940]  I mean, so we're now, though, maneuvered to the edge of the abyss and they're going to hit us with forced inoculations, forced GMO, open borders, global treaties ordering.
[03:02:13.940 --> 03:02:15.640]  We let third world populations in.
[03:02:15.640 --> 03:02:16.940]  That's being announced.
[03:02:16.940 --> 03:02:17.740]  I mean, it's on.
[03:02:17.740 --> 03:02:18.640]  But I mean, you're right.
[03:02:18.640 --> 03:02:27.640]  It's, it's, it's, it's all about any totalitarian despotic oligarchy wants paramilitary on the streets.
[03:02:27.640 --> 03:02:35.140]  I mean, it's just, it goes like a horse and carriage together or like a Hitler mustache on Hitler or an Easter Bunny with pink eggs.
[03:02:35.140 --> 03:02:37.940]  I mean, it just, you know, it just goes to throw Easter Bunny into it.
[03:02:37.940 --> 03:02:39.240]  I mean, that's how it is.
[03:02:39.240 --> 03:02:40.940]  So just drink some glyphosate.
[03:02:40.940 --> 03:02:42.340]  Obama loves you.
[03:02:42.340 --> 03:02:43.840]  Good points, Luke.
[03:02:43.840 --> 03:02:46.240]  Anthony, anything to say to what he just said?
[03:02:46.240 --> 03:02:50.840]  Well, you know, people survive fairly regularly from drinking, drinking glyphosate.
[03:02:50.840 --> 03:02:57.140]  I think empires survive fairly regularly from a military takeover, as in they don't.
[03:02:57.140 --> 03:03:03.140]  And I think ultimately they're counting on less than 5% of the public to actually do something about it with all of the things they do.
[03:03:03.140 --> 03:03:10.740]  Not just Jade Helm, but forcing all these things on us on a daily basis and the training exercises, everything that I remember and my dad was a smart guy.
[03:03:10.740 --> 03:03:17.040]  I mean, he's here, but I mean, he still believed in America and the system, you know, I've been taking over. I remember being a kid with him spraying weed killer.
[03:03:17.040 --> 03:03:24.740]  When, when, when Roundup and Kermit come out in the early 80s, he always told me how pesticide was dangerous and he thought it hurt his dad.
[03:03:24.740 --> 03:03:26.640]  Cooper talks was really just like a cyanide thing.
[03:03:26.640 --> 03:03:27.340]  You put it back in cows.
[03:03:27.340 --> 03:03:29.640]  It took care of the flies though.
[03:03:29.640 --> 03:03:32.140]  And I'm like, daddy goes, no, they say you can even get this on your skin.
[03:03:32.140 --> 03:03:33.540]  You can even drink this.
[03:03:33.540 --> 03:03:36.340]  I remember my dad repeating their propaganda.
[03:03:36.340 --> 03:03:39.240]  Oh, they say a lot of things to remember DDT.
[03:03:39.240 --> 03:03:42.040]  That was totally, totally safe for RBG age.
[03:03:42.040 --> 03:03:47.840]  The recombinant bovine growth hormone, which was made from clone genetically modified, which gets women's genetics more.
[03:03:47.840 --> 03:03:51.340]  That's why I love like a five foot five woman and a five foot nine dad.
[03:03:51.340 --> 03:03:52.740]  They got like a six foot three daughters.
[03:03:52.740 --> 03:03:53.240]  Yeah.
[03:03:53.240 --> 03:03:54.940]  And the pesticides hit men.
[03:03:54.940 --> 03:03:57.440]  That's what causes aggressive prostate cancer.
[03:03:57.440 --> 03:04:03.940]  So it's, it's, it's so insane as you were saying earlier that people can't handle it in their brains.
[03:04:03.940 --> 03:04:07.640]  And I was talking to someone the other day and they told me, they said, look, I don't think that's happening.
[03:04:07.640 --> 03:04:09.140]  I said, why don't you think that's happening?
[03:04:09.140 --> 03:04:11.540]  Why don't you think that these things are actually dangerous to us?
[03:04:11.540 --> 03:04:14.440]  They said, because no one has the capacity to do that.
[03:04:14.440 --> 03:04:15.840]  They can't think in those ways.
[03:04:15.840 --> 03:04:19.540]  They, they, no one is sitting up there thinking about all the ways to hurt us.
[03:04:19.540 --> 03:04:25.940]  But really, I mean, in the fifties, the Joker was always obsessed with binary weapons where he'd sell cosmetics.
[03:04:25.940 --> 03:04:28.040]  And when you put the two on, that's what killed you.
[03:04:28.040 --> 03:04:31.040]  But they could never find out what was killing it was they would test them individually.
[03:04:31.040 --> 03:04:33.440]  So comic book writers knew about this.
[03:04:33.440 --> 03:04:37.540]  Stan Lee, I guess, knew about this, but not them.
[03:04:37.540 --> 03:04:42.840]  So many icons know about this and put in all of their works, just like the latest Captain America.
[03:04:42.840 --> 03:04:48.540]  That was basically one of your episodes, one of your Alex Jones show transcripts put into a movie.
[03:04:48.540 --> 03:04:49.340]  Tell me about Winter Soldier?
[03:04:49.340 --> 03:04:49.840]  Yep.
[03:04:49.840 --> 03:04:52.240]  Well, we now know from Hollywood, actually, the show did influence it.
[03:04:52.240 --> 03:04:53.540]  That was an excellent film.
[03:04:53.540 --> 03:04:55.440]  The New Avengers is unwatchable.
[03:04:55.440 --> 03:04:59.140]  I mean, my God, it's the worst movie ever made.

[03:06:00.440 --> 03:06:01.540]  Why, why, why?
[03:06:01.540 --> 03:06:06.440]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true
[03:06:06.440 --> 03:06:11.040]  nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[03:06:11.040 --> 03:06:13.840]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[03:06:13.840 --> 03:06:17.340]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[03:06:17.340 --> 03:06:22.040]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily
[03:06:22.040 --> 03:06:23.640]  by globalist concoctions.
[03:06:23.640 --> 03:06:28.640]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[03:06:28.640 --> 03:06:33.140]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients
[03:06:33.140 --> 03:06:35.040]  that children would actually like and take.
[03:06:35.040 --> 03:06:39.240]  We worked with the lean manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children
[03:06:39.240 --> 03:06:42.640]  to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[03:06:42.640 --> 03:06:47.940]  Introducing Child Ease with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm

[03:07:11.240 --> 03:07:13.540]  Surprised you got through, you squeak out.

[03:07:28.440 --> 03:07:29.540]  What color are you there?

[03:07:32.240 --> 03:07:34.640]  Jason! Jason!

[03:07:36.640 --> 03:07:38.540]  Okay, we gotta move on to the next caller.
[03:07:38.540 --> 03:07:39.840]  You blew it.
[03:07:39.840 --> 03:07:40.340]  Huh?
[03:07:40.340 --> 03:07:41.840]  Wait, no!

[03:08:23.140 --> 03:08:26.640]  And then I briefly want to talk about Trostegard.
[03:08:26.640 --> 03:08:30.240]  This is undoubtedly the best prostate formula out there.
[03:08:30.240 --> 03:08:34.940]  I don't know why people didn't soup theirs up or add everything into it that's known to help.
[03:08:34.940 --> 03:08:37.240]  And it just does so much amazing things.
[03:08:37.240 --> 03:08:42.740]  My doctor again over a year ago when I turned 41 or 49, I'm over 41, you know,
[03:08:42.740 --> 03:08:46.640]  said you really ought to be on one of these natural prostate things that are out there.
[03:08:46.640 --> 03:08:51.640]  And I just said to Anthony, I said, why don't we develop with our researchers and doctors and people
[03:08:51.640 --> 03:08:53.040]  something that's even better?
[03:08:53.040 --> 03:08:56.840]  That's what I was paying was over $40 of tax for something that's not even as good.
[03:08:56.840 --> 03:08:58.140]  InfoWars.com.
[03:08:58.140 --> 03:09:02.240]  In fact, let's plug this right now with all the stuff bombarding us.
[03:09:02.240 --> 03:09:03.440]  There are natural compounds.
[03:09:03.440 --> 03:09:06.740]  We don't really know why they're known to counteract a lot of this.
[03:09:06.740 --> 03:09:09.540]  And if you're not on nascent iodine that they don't want you to have,
[03:09:09.540 --> 03:09:12.740]  if you're not on the different quality prostate guards that are out there,
[03:09:12.740 --> 03:09:13.740]  ours is the best.
[03:09:13.740 --> 03:09:18.540]  If you're not getting purified water, if you're not doing some of the things to mitigate.
[03:09:18.540 --> 03:09:20.540]  Well, okay.
[03:09:20.540 --> 03:09:22.440]  Then I guess you just want to die.
[03:09:22.440 --> 03:09:24.140]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:09:24.140 --> 03:09:25.740]  It's very popular.
[03:09:25.740 --> 03:09:29.440]  We got 5,000 bottles of this produced and at current sales rates,
[03:09:29.440 --> 03:09:33.040]  it'll be gone by next week, but we're going to be able to produce this pretty quickly.
[03:09:33.040 --> 03:09:35.740]  We want to be able to produce enough of everything to always have it,
[03:09:35.740 --> 03:09:37.040]  but we never know what's going to be a hit.
[03:09:37.040 --> 03:09:38.340]  What is it going to be a hit?
[03:09:38.340 --> 03:09:42.640]  But we try to bring you things that we're really proud of and that will face scrutiny
[03:09:42.640 --> 03:09:48.640]  by enemy operations that test our stuff, government operations and others.
[03:09:48.640 --> 03:09:52.440]  Going over to the fine tooth comb, I give you my word,
[03:09:52.440 --> 03:09:55.540]  this is the best deal you're going to find anywhere on a prostate guard.
[03:09:55.540 --> 03:09:57.840]  That's why it's called Prostate Guard InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:09:57.840 --> 03:09:59.740]  Briefly, Anthony, tell folks about this.
[03:09:59.740 --> 03:10:01.740]  I'll tell you why I'm really happy about it.
[03:10:01.740 --> 03:10:06.140]  Because we looked at, hey, the American Indians were using some of these ingredients like,
[03:10:06.140 --> 03:10:09.640]  lycopene-based derivatives or salt pimento, right?
[03:10:09.640 --> 03:10:14.740]  So they were using this countless centuries ago to the point where they were saying
[03:10:14.740 --> 03:10:16.940]  they already had issues with the reproductive health, right?
[03:10:16.940 --> 03:10:17.740]  Why are you being racist?
[03:10:17.740 --> 03:10:19.540]  And they were taking this, I'm being racist.
[03:10:19.540 --> 03:10:21.240]  Now, look what we're up against.
[03:10:21.240 --> 03:10:25.140]  Deadly pesticides linked to increased prostate cancer risk.
[03:10:25.140 --> 03:10:28.840]  Researchers have begun examining the link between pesticide exposure and the development
[03:10:28.840 --> 03:10:33.140]  of prostate cancer with scientists documenting increased prevalence of prostate cancer
[03:10:33.140 --> 03:10:35.240]  among older men exposed to certain pesticides.
[03:10:35.240 --> 03:10:37.340]  Now, what's funny here-
[03:10:37.340 --> 03:10:38.740]  You mean pesticides might hurt you?
[03:10:38.740 --> 03:10:40.440]  That sounds like a conspiracy theory.
[03:10:40.440 --> 03:10:42.640]  And what's funny, and we have this over and over again.
[03:10:42.640 --> 03:10:48.140]  And then what's funny, though, is the research about junk food causing aggressive prostate cancer,
[03:10:48.140 --> 03:10:51.740]  like soda, that has to do with the pesticide content.
[03:10:51.740 --> 03:10:53.540]  Everyone is getting exposed to pesticides.
[03:10:53.540 --> 03:10:55.340]  If you go outside, you're getting exposed to pesticides.
[03:10:55.340 --> 03:10:58.740]  Why does soda pop to using ink term?
[03:10:58.740 --> 03:11:01.940]  Why does it have so much pesticide in it?
[03:11:01.940 --> 03:11:06.640]  Well, because whatever is as cheap as possible to make, these multinational conglomerates will do.
[03:11:06.640 --> 03:11:11.840]  So if it saves five cents to use the crappiest junk made from China and grown from China-
[03:11:11.840 --> 03:11:16.340]  Well, the high fructose corn syrup, yes, the corn takes poison out of the soil.
[03:11:16.340 --> 03:11:19.940]  Yeah, and not to mention, it's genetically modified and filled with mercury from the first-
[03:11:19.940 --> 03:11:21.040]  They're spraying it with glyphosate.
[03:11:21.040 --> 03:11:25.840]  Yeah, they spray it, they douse it with glyphosate, just douse it with Roundup over and over and over again,
[03:11:25.840 --> 03:11:28.140]  so that nothing happens to the crop.
[03:11:28.140 --> 03:11:28.840]  So it's cheaper.
[03:11:28.840 --> 03:11:31.140]  It's cheaper to produce when you douse it with all this garbage,
[03:11:31.140 --> 03:11:33.640]  and then you're going to mill it up and you're going to put it in the soda.
[03:11:33.640 --> 03:11:34.840]  And then the actual-
[03:11:34.840 --> 03:11:38.740]  What's funny is they have preservatives which are basically pesticides themselves
[03:11:38.740 --> 03:11:43.240]  because they also need to preserve the soda content in the huge batch systems,
[03:11:43.240 --> 03:11:48.040]  and they also don't want to get sued because they don't want to have any type of growth in there.
[03:11:48.040 --> 03:11:50.040]  They don't want to have any type of foreign-
[03:11:50.040 --> 03:11:53.240]  That's right, it's harder to be organic, it's harder to have quality.
[03:11:53.240 --> 03:11:58.040]  But I mean, even leading competitors in nutraceuticals that have pretty clean stuff,
[03:11:58.040 --> 03:12:03.240]  but it'll have like one ingredient at a level we know is costing them $2 a bottle,
[03:12:03.240 --> 03:12:07.540]  and then we just go, we'll just put $9 of stuff in there and sell it for $19
[03:12:07.540 --> 03:12:09.040]  and make change the whole industry.
[03:12:09.040 --> 03:12:10.640]  I just don't get-
[03:12:10.640 --> 03:12:11.840]  Like, why don't they-
[03:12:11.840 --> 03:12:13.440]  People just-
[03:12:13.440 --> 03:12:15.840]  We're like light years better than almost everybody's, what I'm saying.
[03:12:15.840 --> 03:12:18.140]  We are just so good at m4slife.com.
[03:12:18.140 --> 03:12:19.440]  It's sickening.
[03:12:19.440 --> 03:12:23.340]  And just think about when we talked to one of those executives that came on the show actually,
[03:12:23.340 --> 03:12:25.340]  Breckler, our good friend there.
[03:12:25.340 --> 03:12:30.340]  He came in and told us about manufacturers that were sweeping herbs off the ground
[03:12:30.340 --> 03:12:34.640]  from the conveyor belts and dumping them back on to put into the supplement capsules.
[03:12:34.640 --> 03:12:35.740]  We don't do anything like that.
[03:12:35.740 --> 03:12:39.340]  And secondarily, he was telling us about these companies, and I already know about this.
[03:12:39.340 --> 03:12:41.940]  We've talked about this time and time again, some that you would know if I said,
[03:12:41.940 --> 03:12:47.240]  which I'm not going to, they cost $0.13 sometimes a bottle for the actual content.
[03:12:47.240 --> 03:12:48.840]  The bottle and stuff cost a little bit more, but $0.13.
[03:12:48.840 --> 03:12:51.040]  I know, and I thought because that's a top brand, I was like,
[03:12:51.040 --> 03:12:53.240]  I want to do what they've done, that people say they're the best.
[03:12:53.240 --> 03:12:57.240]  We went research, we're like, we had it tested, we're like, oh my gosh.
[03:12:57.240 --> 03:12:59.240]  Yeah, we're not touching that.
[03:12:59.240 --> 03:13:00.140]  I mean, our margins-
[03:13:00.140 --> 03:13:01.840]  Oh, we're not just saying this.
[03:13:01.840 --> 03:13:04.840]  I mean, because I mean, even crap, herbs are so powerful
[03:13:04.840 --> 03:13:08.040]  that even cruddy brands are better than nothing.
[03:13:08.040 --> 03:13:11.340]  I mean, no one would put out pure iodine like us.
[03:13:11.340 --> 03:13:12.340]  And just no one still does.
[03:13:12.340 --> 03:13:15.440]  They just don't care because it's expensive.
[03:13:15.440 --> 03:13:15.940]  Yeah.
[03:13:15.940 --> 03:13:16.540]  And that's why-
[03:13:16.540 --> 03:13:19.440]  I mean, why not put out the best?
[03:13:19.440 --> 03:13:21.540]  This is a free market capitalist.
[03:13:21.540 --> 03:13:24.740]  If I had a car, I'd want to have it at the most, like Henry Ford,
[03:13:24.740 --> 03:13:28.240]  the most affordable price that makes me a good profit,
[03:13:28.240 --> 03:13:34.340]  that destroys my competition, that's quality because I want to dominate the market.
[03:13:34.340 --> 03:13:38.440]  But nowadays, it's all about just from a sinister view.
[03:13:38.440 --> 03:13:38.940]  Yeah.
[03:13:38.940 --> 03:13:42.140]  Also, just want to have high quality, want to be a good guy and survive attacks.
[03:13:42.140 --> 03:13:44.340]  But it just makes sense to the right thing, Anthony.
[03:13:44.340 --> 03:13:44.640]  It does.
[03:13:44.640 --> 03:13:48.040]  And then that's why these stores that contact us to the brick and mortar stores,
[03:13:48.040 --> 03:13:49.040]  hey, we want to carry your stuff.
[03:13:49.040 --> 03:13:49.840]  Okay, great.
[03:13:49.840 --> 03:13:50.740]  Here's what we get it for.
[03:13:50.740 --> 03:13:51.740]  Here's what you can sell it for.
[03:13:51.740 --> 03:13:53.240]  They're like, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[03:13:53.240 --> 03:13:56.040]  You need to jack your prices up by about three to four times,
[03:13:56.040 --> 03:13:57.340]  and then we can do that.
[03:13:57.340 --> 03:13:59.440]  They think that we're not selling it high enough because-
[03:13:59.440 --> 03:14:03.140]  Yeah, we're like this 1995 bottle, this $9 a bottle,
[03:14:03.140 --> 03:14:06.940]  this 30-something dollar bottle is $16 a bottle,
[03:14:06.940 --> 03:14:10.440]  this $130 bottle is like $60 a bottle.
[03:14:10.440 --> 03:14:13.040]  And they're like, well, you need a three or four time markup.
[03:14:13.040 --> 03:14:15.940]  And then we're like, listen, we'll split the profit with you,
[03:14:15.940 --> 03:14:18.440]  put it in your store, we'll make $5, you'll make-
[03:14:18.440 --> 03:14:19.440]  No, no, no.
[03:14:19.440 --> 03:14:20.040]  They told us-
[03:14:20.040 --> 03:14:20.540]  No, no, no.
[03:14:20.540 --> 03:14:21.440]  You need to go and get stuff that's-
[03:14:21.440 --> 03:14:21.940]  $40.
[03:14:21.940 --> 03:14:22.440]  Huh?
[03:14:22.440 --> 03:14:25.340]  They told us we need to sell profit guard for at least $40.
[03:14:25.340 --> 03:14:27.840]  That's what I was told from one of the leading labs working on that.
[03:14:27.840 --> 03:14:28.440]  I know.
[03:14:28.440 --> 03:14:29.540]  1995.
[03:14:29.540 --> 03:14:30.240]  Yep.
[03:14:30.240 --> 03:14:33.740]  But we still make a big profit to fund the operation.
[03:14:33.740 --> 03:14:34.340]  Yeah.
[03:14:34.340 --> 03:14:35.540]  And then everybody's going to come to us.
[03:14:35.540 --> 03:14:36.940]  They just don't get it, man.
[03:14:36.940 --> 03:14:38.940]  I tell you, sometimes I don't think I'm that smart,
[03:14:38.940 --> 03:14:41.340]  but compared to the general public and even corporate people,
[03:14:41.340 --> 03:14:42.540]  Breckler's super smart.
[03:14:42.540 --> 03:14:45.540]  But a lot of these other people, they're not smart, man.
[03:14:45.540 --> 03:14:46.840]  Well, they think that if they-
[03:14:46.840 --> 03:14:48.940]  They think screwing someone gets them ahead.
[03:14:48.940 --> 03:14:49.840]  Yep.
[03:14:49.840 --> 03:14:52.340]  And then what happens is people understand that and they're not going to buy-
[03:14:52.340 --> 03:14:56.440]  People want to know why all the Hollywood folks and all the generals and all these famous people love me,
[03:14:56.440 --> 03:14:57.540]  because they've been watching me for 20 years.
[03:14:57.540 --> 03:14:58.440]  They know I'm for real.
[03:14:58.440 --> 03:14:59.840]  I don't screw people over.
[03:14:59.840 --> 03:15:01.540]  I don't release info on people.
[03:15:01.540 --> 03:15:04.240]  I treat people like I want to be treated.
[03:15:04.240 --> 03:15:05.240]  Golden rule, baby.
[03:15:05.240 --> 03:15:08.040]  I mean, I don't know why folks don't get that.
[03:15:08.040 --> 03:15:10.540]  You know, I think it all comes down to motivation,
[03:15:10.540 --> 03:15:15.640]  because obviously we want to have the financial support to do what we're doing and continue to make a difference in all these things.
[03:15:15.640 --> 03:15:19.640]  But at the same time, we want to actually give quality products because we understand,
[03:15:19.640 --> 03:15:21.640]  even if we were bad, right?
[03:15:21.640 --> 03:15:24.940]  We understand, hey, maybe we should make something that's not junk, right?
[03:15:24.940 --> 03:15:29.440]  But these companies, they make junk and then they jack up the prices and they sell you garbage.
[03:15:29.440 --> 03:15:31.640]  And they expect you to keep coming back when that's just not going to happen.
[03:15:31.640 --> 03:15:32.640]  Well, it's the Walmart view.
[03:15:32.640 --> 03:15:35.040]  Like, I mean, I don't know how many times I did this until I won't do it.
[03:15:35.040 --> 03:15:39.240]  My kids would want a toy at, I didn't really get a Walmart, but say Target or even some smaller store.
[03:15:39.240 --> 03:15:41.040]  It would break before you got out of the box.
[03:15:41.040 --> 03:15:44.340]  I mean, you'd get out of the box, it's broken, or it breaks an hour.
[03:15:44.340 --> 03:15:47.440]  You spent $45 on some robot and it breaks an hour.
[03:15:47.440 --> 03:15:54.640]  And you know, or it's like, used to America was known for quality or Japan still is.
[03:15:54.640 --> 03:15:57.240]  They know what they're doing, like a Toyota car or a Honda.
[03:15:57.240 --> 03:16:00.440]  No, it's true. That's why German engineered cars are usually the best to it.
[03:16:00.440 --> 03:16:04.440]  It's sad to think that these days when you're buying a vehicle, you think, well, as long
[03:16:04.440 --> 03:16:09.140]  as I don't get something that's American made, unless it's the higher end one that I'm pretty
[03:16:09.140 --> 03:16:10.140]  much.
[03:16:10.140 --> 03:16:11.140]  But America got better.
[03:16:11.140 --> 03:16:13.240]  It has actually increased.
[03:16:13.240 --> 03:16:17.340]  And then that's also, I think, why we're seeing more quality stores.
[03:16:17.340 --> 03:16:21.480]  Just McDonald's, for example, losing all the money is because competitors to Whole Foods
[03:16:21.480 --> 03:16:22.480]  are rising up.
[03:16:22.480 --> 03:16:25.560]  And that's why Whole Foods recently was on the news, had to lower their prices because
[03:16:25.560 --> 03:16:29.080]  competitors in the organic US market are coming in.
[03:16:29.080 --> 03:16:32.240]  And that's the same for furniture and cars and toys and everything.
[03:16:32.240 --> 03:16:33.240]  Competition is the answer.
[03:16:33.240 --> 03:16:34.240]  It is.
[03:16:34.240 --> 03:16:39.680]  And as we see the bureaucracy decrease, we'll see the capitalistic competition increase,
[03:16:39.680 --> 03:16:40.680]  if that ever happens.
[03:16:40.680 --> 03:16:41.680]  I totally agree.
[03:16:41.680 --> 03:16:45.800]  Two trillion in bureaucracy laws and regulations last year.
[03:16:45.800 --> 03:16:55.200]  Well, you can find the whole family of InfoWarsLife.com products at infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:16:55.200 --> 03:16:59.000]  If you're above 40 and you're not taking prostagard, you're insane.
[03:16:59.000 --> 03:17:02.520]  And I mean, if you're not filtering your water, you're insane with a filter that cuts
[03:17:02.520 --> 03:17:03.520]  out glyphosate.
[03:17:03.520 --> 03:17:06.040]  I mean, glyphosate's worse than fluoride because it's hit everything.
[03:17:06.040 --> 03:17:11.440]  And I mean, look at the Mayo Clinic, I never even got to that yesterday, a barely Mayo Clinic
[03:17:11.440 --> 03:17:16.000]  on Sao Palmetto, one ingredient in our formula.
[03:17:16.000 --> 03:17:18.800]  And this is not an endorsement of our product, but I was just talking about Sao Palmetto,
[03:17:18.800 --> 03:17:19.960]  and this is really powerful.
[03:17:19.960 --> 03:17:23.400]  So this is from the Mayo Clinic, super, super respected, number one hospital in the United
[03:17:23.400 --> 03:17:24.920]  States every single year.
[03:17:24.920 --> 03:17:30.360]  Sao Palmetto is used popularly in Europe to treat symptoms of enlarged prostate, although
[03:17:30.360 --> 03:17:33.680]  it is not considered the standard of care in the United States, it is most popular herbal
[03:17:33.680 --> 03:17:35.080]  treatment for this condition.
[03:17:35.080 --> 03:17:39.120]  More than 2 million American men use Sao Palmetto for enlarged prostate, and it is commonly
[03:17:39.120 --> 03:17:43.800]  recommended as an alternative treatment by the US FDA.
[03:17:43.800 --> 03:17:45.040]  That's some powerful stuff right there.
[03:17:45.040 --> 03:17:46.440]  And then it goes into what it does.
[03:17:46.440 --> 03:17:49.720]  Because you go to your doctor and they say, oh, it's time to start radiation immediately.
[03:17:49.720 --> 03:17:51.720]  It's time to start radiation.
[03:17:51.720 --> 03:17:52.800]  You name it, we're going to go into...
[03:17:52.800 --> 03:17:56.680]  I can't tell you how many 50, 60, 70-year-old guys that we're going to have to have surgery
[03:17:56.680 --> 03:18:00.480]  that then tell me, that's why such a popular product, or the ads everywhere for prostate
[03:18:00.480 --> 03:18:05.520]  and stuff, would just Sao Palmetto, because it just shrinks up and it's back, and then
[03:18:05.520 --> 03:18:07.520]  suddenly it's working again.
[03:18:07.520 --> 03:18:11.280]  And then critics say, well, there's been a lot of research, Sao Palmetto is great, but
[03:18:11.280 --> 03:18:14.160]  there's some things that's not good for it, that's where Lycopene comes in.
[03:18:14.160 --> 03:18:15.160]  It's the new Sao Palmetto.
[03:18:15.160 --> 03:18:16.920]  That's why we put it in this formula.
[03:18:16.920 --> 03:18:18.200]  This is actually groundbreaking.
[03:18:18.200 --> 03:18:23.000]  This is really new, a formula that includes selenium, Sao Palmetto, Lycopene, vitamin
[03:18:23.000 --> 03:18:26.680]  D, copper, zinc, plant sterols, zinc.
[03:18:26.680 --> 03:18:28.000]  This is all of the things.
[03:18:28.000 --> 03:18:30.440]  So if you're taking Sao Palmetto, great, you're doing a good job.
[03:18:30.440 --> 03:18:33.760]  But then someone can come in and say, well, it doesn't do this for certain forms of aggressive
[03:18:33.760 --> 03:18:37.120]  prostate cancer, what type B and blah, blah, blah, well, that's why we have those.
[03:18:37.120 --> 03:18:39.240]  This isn't a culmination of all of the...
[03:18:39.240 --> 03:18:41.920]  We got all the top formulators, the top guys, the latest literature.
[03:18:41.920 --> 03:18:45.560]  We make the highest quality product we can for half the price of the leading competitor
[03:18:45.560 --> 03:18:46.560]  that doesn't even have all this.
[03:18:46.560 --> 03:18:48.360]  Yeah, and the total men win, men win, men win.
[03:18:48.360 --> 03:18:51.360]  The reason we talk about this at length is because we're proud of it.
[03:18:51.360 --> 03:18:54.280]  You see, people with products, they want to hawk and they want to push on you that aren't
[03:18:54.280 --> 03:18:55.280]  high quality.
[03:18:55.280 --> 03:18:56.280]  They say, oh, well, we have this, by the way.
[03:18:56.280 --> 03:18:59.880]  We sit here and talk about it at length because it's content, it's powerful, it adds value
[03:18:59.880 --> 03:19:02.280]  to others, and it adds value to this operation.
[03:19:02.280 --> 03:19:07.480]  The brand system of Infowars Life is so powerful that talking about it is actually thrilling.
[03:19:07.480 --> 03:19:11.000]  I'm going to skip this network break because I got to go to these calls, Anthony, stay
[03:19:11.000 --> 03:19:12.800]  with me if you're absolutely right.
[03:19:12.800 --> 03:19:13.800]  Look at this.
[03:19:13.800 --> 03:19:17.400]  Looking at the Fed, I could have spoken the whole show about this, a Hill article about
[03:19:17.400 --> 03:19:19.400]  how corrupt the Fed is, how they screwed everything up.
[03:19:19.400 --> 03:19:22.600]  I mean, Federal Reserve, in deep trouble, not federal.
[03:19:22.600 --> 03:19:25.760]  Just a hoax after hoax.
[03:19:25.760 --> 03:19:32.560]  Let me continue here, ladies and gentlemen, and get to this piece of news.
[03:19:32.560 --> 03:19:34.000]  Where did my articles just go?
[03:19:34.000 --> 03:19:35.000]  Here it is.
[03:19:35.000 --> 03:19:43.760]  Why China is taking control of physical gold, a big article there, and it basically shows
[03:19:43.760 --> 03:19:44.760]  them hoarding.
[03:19:44.760 --> 03:19:47.440]  The country is currently lobbying to be included in the International Monetary Fund's Reserve
[03:19:47.440 --> 03:19:48.440]  currency.
[03:19:48.440 --> 03:19:52.600]  Gold has a lot to do with that, so they're going to back up their new global currency
[03:19:52.600 --> 03:19:57.960]  with that, and then HSBC has come out.
[03:19:57.960 --> 03:20:03.080]  The world economy faces a titanic problem, Treasury yields have not risen, budget deficits
[03:20:03.080 --> 03:20:05.480]  not falling, welfare payments are on the rise.
[03:20:05.480 --> 03:20:09.440]  Oh, this was supposed to fix all that, QE Unlimited.
[03:20:09.440 --> 03:20:13.360]  But now their chief economist, Stephen King, is already thinking about the next recession.
[03:20:13.360 --> 03:20:14.360]  It's already here, folks.
[03:20:14.360 --> 03:20:15.360]  We've been telling you.
[03:20:15.360 --> 03:20:19.520]  In a note to clients Wednesday, he warned, just like JPMorgan did a month ago, and we
[03:20:19.520 --> 03:20:23.360]  got that internal memo, the world economy is like an ocean liner with liveboats.
[03:20:23.360 --> 03:20:27.120]  If another recession hits, it could be truly a titanic struggle for policymakers.
[03:20:27.120 --> 03:20:28.120]  You hear that?
[03:20:28.120 --> 03:20:33.520]  We're talking about titanic events, sinking events, establishment people making it to
[03:20:33.520 --> 03:20:34.520]  the liveboats.
[03:20:34.520 --> 03:20:38.880]  That's why JPMorgan is like, prepared for fortress mentality.
[03:20:38.880 --> 03:20:42.280]  We are in the command base, but this crisis will be the great decider.
[03:20:42.280 --> 03:20:48.080]  This new system we're entering will be unparalleled, and we may survive to dominate everything,
[03:20:48.080 --> 03:20:49.080]  but brace yourselves.
[03:20:49.080 --> 03:20:50.080]  I mean, whoa.
[03:20:50.080 --> 03:20:51.080]  I'm paraphrasing it.
[03:20:51.080 --> 03:20:52.080]  That's what he basically said.
[03:20:52.080 --> 03:20:54.080]  I mean, what do you think is going on here?
[03:20:54.080 --> 03:20:55.080]  Well, it's pretty simple.
[03:20:55.080 --> 03:20:58.360]  All of the people that are in the know that are actually going to listen to the top executives
[03:20:58.360 --> 03:21:01.640]  that they work for or know personally are going to sit around, and they're going to
[03:21:01.640 --> 03:21:04.320]  go to the bar, and they're going to say, hey, something really bad is happening.
[03:21:04.320 --> 03:21:06.320]  I hang around with, you hang out with billionaires?
[03:21:06.320 --> 03:21:07.320]  No, I know.
[03:21:07.320 --> 03:21:08.680]  Who do you think they want to hang around with?
[03:21:08.680 --> 03:21:14.720]  What the average snot knows, wants to watch sports all day, this is all they talk about.
[03:21:14.720 --> 03:21:17.080]  The general public just needs to know, folks, we're in trouble.
[03:21:17.080 --> 03:21:23.040]  I spoke to one the other day, and he is the kind of guy that's, he's a fun guy that isn't
[03:21:23.040 --> 03:21:26.880]  always stressed out, but he just looked at me and he just said, just be prepared, just
[03:21:26.880 --> 03:21:28.480]  start saving money.
[03:21:28.480 --> 03:21:29.480]  And that's all he said.
[03:21:29.480 --> 03:21:32.080]  And these people are also really smart because they're not going to tell you exactly what's
[03:21:32.080 --> 03:21:37.080]  going on because they hear from their buddy who has the insider information, but everyone
[03:21:37.080 --> 03:21:42.120]  knows at that level that none of the general public is going to listen to you.
[03:21:42.120 --> 03:21:45.120]  They're going to tell their friends and their family, and that's what J.P. Morgan is doing.
[03:21:45.120 --> 03:21:46.920]  They're going to warn the people that'll listen.
[03:21:46.920 --> 03:21:50.480]  But the other 95% of people are not going to listen, and they're going to criticize
[03:21:50.480 --> 03:21:54.440]  Alex Jones for going on the air and even talking about J.P. Morgan saying that.
[03:21:54.440 --> 03:22:01.400]  And that's how it turns into this never-ending strategy of we can say anything we want anywhere,
[03:22:01.400 --> 03:22:04.040]  and no one's going to listen, and they're going to attack the messenger.
[03:22:04.040 --> 03:22:06.100]  They laugh about it, and they think it's funny.
[03:22:06.100 --> 03:22:09.360]  That's why they say the economy's imploding, get ready, get prepared.
[03:22:09.360 --> 03:22:13.240]  To those maybe less than 1% of the people that actually are going to take action and
[03:22:13.240 --> 03:22:15.360]  do things, and this audience included.
[03:22:15.360 --> 03:22:18.280]  And then the rest of the people are going to run around and say you're a conspiracy theorist
[03:22:18.280 --> 03:22:19.280]  until it happens again.
[03:22:19.280 --> 03:22:20.280]  You're right.
[03:22:20.280 --> 03:22:21.280]  I don't want Alex to hang up.
[03:22:21.280 --> 03:22:22.280]  I didn't even start.
[03:22:22.280 --> 03:22:24.120]  Guys, make me start reading what people say.
[03:22:24.120 --> 03:22:25.920]  Wife got visited by TSA at work.
[03:22:25.920 --> 03:22:27.040]  Yeah, that's the new thing.
[03:22:27.040 --> 03:22:28.040]  They're on the streets.
[03:22:28.040 --> 03:22:31.040]  And I saw them 14 years ago say they'd do that.
[03:22:31.040 --> 03:22:32.400]  People are like, how do you know that?
[03:22:32.400 --> 03:22:33.920]  They said they would.
[03:22:33.920 --> 03:22:36.600]  It's like, how do we know they're going to replace the troops with robots?
[03:22:36.600 --> 03:22:42.720]  They said, they said they put flora on the water to dumb us down.
[03:22:42.720 --> 03:22:46.480]  And then Smith on Jade Helm and Sean on health comments.
[03:22:46.480 --> 03:22:50.520]  I may just end up doing the whole hour here, because I just want to keep rolling here,
[03:22:50.520 --> 03:22:51.520]  Anthony.
[03:22:51.520 --> 03:22:52.520]  This is key intel.
[03:22:52.520 --> 03:22:53.520]  We're going over.
[03:22:53.520 --> 03:22:54.520]  But we're going to go to these calls in a moment.
[03:22:54.520 --> 03:22:56.040]  But first, I've been promising yesterday and today to play this.
[03:22:56.040 --> 03:23:01.120]  I want to play a clip from The Five now on Monday.
[03:23:01.120 --> 03:23:02.120]  And I was going to cover it Tuesday.
[03:23:02.120 --> 03:23:04.360]  And this is just one of many TV shows attacking us.
[03:23:04.360 --> 03:23:09.800]  But there they're saying how dare Senator Cruz Abbott listened to Alex Jones.
[03:23:09.800 --> 03:23:14.640]  Well, I'm like somebody at the parapet going, enemy forces just came over the hill.
[03:23:14.640 --> 03:23:15.840]  They're there.
[03:23:15.840 --> 03:23:17.280]  Not that the military's the enemy.
[03:23:17.280 --> 03:23:19.920]  The globalists are in control of this.
[03:23:19.920 --> 03:23:21.320]  They're acclimating.
[03:23:21.320 --> 03:23:25.800]  And so they want to ridicule this when everybody knows we're going into a police state.
[03:23:25.800 --> 03:23:28.120]  Let's go ahead and go to this clip and analyze it.
[03:23:28.120 --> 03:23:36.160]  They've got Texas flags on the TVs, they're shitting around.
[03:23:36.160 --> 03:23:39.800]  There are all kinds of conspiracy theories floating around about an upcoming Pentagon
[03:23:39.800 --> 03:23:43.000]  training exercise called Operation Jed Helm 15.
[03:23:43.000 --> 03:23:47.440]  It's a program that's going to run eight weeks in seven states beginning in July with troops
[03:23:47.440 --> 03:23:49.920]  practicing certain military maneuvers.
[03:23:49.920 --> 03:23:55.080]  In Texas, the prospect of armed federal troops has sparked an avalanche of speculation, including
[03:23:55.080 --> 03:24:02.040]  fears of a government conspiracy to launch a hostile takeover of the state.
[03:24:02.040 --> 03:24:04.000]  In the words of John Stuart, they already took over.
[03:24:04.000 --> 03:24:08.880]  We're pointing out that it's an acclimation for just general occupation with the TSA on
[03:24:08.880 --> 03:24:12.720]  street corners as they now are in every major Texas city.
[03:24:12.720 --> 03:24:15.080]  I mean, you know, we have the documents.
[03:24:15.080 --> 03:24:17.560]  Let's continue with the five.
[03:24:17.560 --> 03:24:18.560]  Here it is.
[03:24:18.560 --> 03:24:21.320]  Although the Defense Department vows, there are no such plans to do so.
[03:24:21.320 --> 03:24:24.600]  Senator Cruz understands the concern.
[03:24:24.600 --> 03:24:30.120]  I understand the reason for concern and uncertainty because what the federal government has not
[03:24:30.120 --> 03:24:33.720]  demonstrated itself to be trustworthy in this administration.
[03:24:33.720 --> 03:24:38.760]  The natural consequence is that many of the citizens don't trust what it's saying.
[03:24:38.760 --> 03:24:39.760]  Oh boy.
[03:24:39.760 --> 03:24:43.480]  Former Texas Governor Rick Perry understands as well, but thinks Americans can trust the
[03:24:43.480 --> 03:24:44.480]  military.
[03:24:44.480 --> 03:24:48.400]  I don't think there's a problem to question your government.
[03:24:48.400 --> 03:24:53.600]  I do it on a regular basis, and I think that's a healthy thing to question your government.
[03:24:53.600 --> 03:24:57.120]  I don't think it's particularly healthy to question the military.
[03:24:57.120 --> 03:24:59.280]  It paused.
[03:24:59.280 --> 03:25:03.000]  The military is run by the politicians that are putting us under secret treaties right
[03:25:03.000 --> 03:25:04.000]  now.
[03:25:04.000 --> 03:25:07.440]  I mean, imagine how they talk to us like we're five.
[03:25:07.440 --> 03:25:09.520]  We're talking about the command of the military.
[03:25:09.520 --> 03:25:13.840]  It'd be like in World War II, if the Nazis had propaganda going, it's okay to question
[03:25:13.840 --> 03:25:16.280]  Hitler, but don't question our military.
[03:25:16.280 --> 03:25:21.240]  I mean, you know, it is just insane.
[03:25:21.240 --> 03:25:22.240]  Let's continue here.
[03:25:22.240 --> 03:25:23.760]  Let's go back.
[03:25:23.760 --> 03:25:24.760]  Wow.
[03:25:24.760 --> 03:25:28.480]  And Governor Abbott of Texas has apparently sent the National Guard out to make sure the
[03:25:28.480 --> 03:25:30.040]  army doesn't get too out of control.
[03:25:30.040 --> 03:25:31.040]  So can we just all agree?
[03:25:31.040 --> 03:25:32.040]  It paused.
[03:25:32.040 --> 03:25:33.040]  Pause to show what he said.
[03:25:33.040 --> 03:25:36.800]  He said, to allay fears, and to monitor the feds as a state function, we'll have them
[03:25:36.800 --> 03:25:37.800]  there.
[03:25:37.800 --> 03:25:41.080]  And they're actually working with them in some of the more legitimate drills.
[03:25:41.080 --> 03:25:42.800]  Let's go back to the clip.
[03:25:42.800 --> 03:25:45.200]  Eric, can we, can you make me in this?
[03:25:45.200 --> 03:25:46.200]  No, this is a little nuts.
[03:25:46.200 --> 03:25:50.800]  I think we, I'm not sure that there was a fair set up to take Cruz and even Rick Perry.
[03:25:50.800 --> 03:25:56.400]  Look, this is, this is inspired, the Jade Helm 15 conspiracy theorists are inspired by
[03:25:56.400 --> 03:26:02.360]  Alex Jones, a nut job radio guy who, who actually was asked to go onto ABC and didn't, for some
[03:26:02.360 --> 03:26:05.600]  reason over the weekend, didn't show up for that segment.
[03:26:05.600 --> 03:26:09.600]  I'm ready to come on live via satellite, please, right now.
[03:26:09.600 --> 03:26:10.600]  Okay.
[03:26:10.600 --> 03:26:14.400]  I mean, this was in hundreds of papers saying that I'm a chicken.
[03:26:14.400 --> 03:26:18.280]  I mean, this, this is a dirty tricks thing I got to pull and no, none of my listeners
[03:26:18.280 --> 03:26:19.280]  buy it.
[03:26:19.280 --> 03:26:20.280]  Okay.
[03:26:20.280 --> 03:26:24.240]  So I'm ready to come on right now.
[03:26:24.240 --> 03:26:26.040]  Your show.
[03:26:26.040 --> 03:26:29.920]  So see, you can't even discredit what I stand for.
[03:26:29.920 --> 03:26:33.920]  So you just sit there and act like I wouldn't come on ABC.
[03:26:33.920 --> 03:26:37.520]  In fact, I want my listeners to call Fox news guys, can you find me Fox news phone number
[03:26:37.520 --> 03:26:39.680]  in New York?
[03:26:39.680 --> 03:26:44.280]  I want an article out by whoever wants to ride around here, challenging Fox news, ABC,
[03:26:44.280 --> 03:26:45.280]  everybody.
[03:26:45.280 --> 03:26:46.280]  I'm ready to marathon.
[03:26:46.280 --> 03:26:52.080]  In fact, I'm ready, if you want to have me on when I'm here, I will have David Knight
[03:26:52.080 --> 03:26:58.120]  do the show tomorrow and I will come in fact, I'll fly to New York beyond the five right
[03:26:58.120 --> 03:26:59.120]  now.
[03:26:59.120 --> 03:27:03.560]  I mean, it is just, it is just, I just hit this and broke my, I think you're counting
[03:27:03.560 --> 03:27:04.560]  in fear.
[03:27:04.560 --> 03:27:08.560]  As ABC news says, look at you, you're a cowering in fear at the opportunity.
[03:27:08.560 --> 03:27:10.560]  I just hit the table and just broke the audio thing.
[03:27:10.560 --> 03:27:12.360]  I have no audio now.
[03:27:12.360 --> 03:27:13.360]  I'm cowering.
[03:27:13.360 --> 03:27:15.240]  Everybody knows I'm cowering in fear.
[03:27:15.240 --> 03:27:19.080]  It's like I'm, I'm going up because the club is going, ah, it's like that I'm afraid to
[03:27:19.080 --> 03:27:20.080]  go on the show.
[03:27:20.080 --> 03:27:24.880]  That is the face of fear of an interview of law, man, I'm going to be able to keep doing
[03:27:24.880 --> 03:27:25.880]  over.
[03:27:25.880 --> 03:27:27.200]  I'm afraid to do my own show now.
[03:27:27.200 --> 03:27:28.400]  I just faked breaking that.
[03:27:28.400 --> 03:27:29.400]  I'm so shook up.
[03:27:29.400 --> 03:27:31.520]  I won't be able to hear the audio, but I'll just go back to it.
[03:27:31.520 --> 03:27:32.520]  Here we go.
[03:27:32.520 --> 03:27:34.880]  Can you guys come to jack this into something else on their wire in here?
[03:27:34.880 --> 03:27:37.080]  Let's just do it live on air right now.
[03:27:37.080 --> 03:27:38.680]  It's not, I don't need another headpiece.
[03:27:38.680 --> 03:27:42.480]  I need to plug into one of the guest plugins right here.
[03:27:42.480 --> 03:27:43.480]  That's all I need.
[03:27:43.480 --> 03:27:47.160]  I hit something and broke the connection in here to my hookup.
[03:27:47.160 --> 03:27:48.920]  He was too afraid to go on ABC news.
[03:27:48.920 --> 03:27:49.920]  I'm too afraid right now.
[03:27:49.920 --> 03:27:53.080]  That's why I'm going 30 minutes over the show.
[03:27:53.080 --> 03:27:55.320]  That's why I won't even take calls to have guests at the time.
[03:27:55.320 --> 03:27:56.520]  I'm afraid to talk.
[03:27:56.520 --> 03:28:00.760]  I'm so scared of being on air.
[03:28:00.760 --> 03:28:02.840]  They were in here live yesterday with two other hookups.
[03:28:02.840 --> 03:28:04.360]  We've got it.
[03:28:04.360 --> 03:28:07.840]  Anyways, I can't even go back to the clip right now.
[03:28:07.840 --> 03:28:09.320]  Thank you, sir.
[03:28:09.320 --> 03:28:10.320]  Okay.
[03:28:10.320 --> 03:28:11.320]  Yes, I have audio.
[03:28:11.320 --> 03:28:12.320]  It's back.
[03:28:12.320 --> 03:28:13.320]  You'll see I broke it.
[03:28:13.320 --> 03:28:14.320]  I don't know how I did that.
[03:28:14.320 --> 03:28:15.320]  I'm breaking things.
[03:28:15.320 --> 03:28:16.320]  I know.
[03:28:16.320 --> 03:28:17.320]  I'm so afraid.
[03:28:17.320 --> 03:28:18.920]  That's why I'm taking it on the whole new world order.
[03:28:18.920 --> 03:28:21.080]  Let's go ahead and go back to him saying I'm afraid.
[03:28:21.080 --> 03:28:22.080]  Here we go.
[03:28:22.080 --> 03:28:24.280]  Look, Alex Jones is a 9-11 truther.
[03:28:24.280 --> 03:28:30.200]  He's an Oklahoma City truther and any opportunity he can to perpetuate as conspiracy theory
[03:28:30.200 --> 03:28:31.720]  he will.
[03:28:31.720 --> 03:28:37.040]  Simulation, military simulation is an important way of training people for an emergency.
[03:28:37.040 --> 03:28:38.840]  You don't want to do it after or during.
[03:28:38.840 --> 03:28:41.560]  You want to do it before and that's all this is what this is about.
[03:28:41.560 --> 03:28:44.720]  Kimberly, what's weird to me about this is you've got the governor of Texas.
[03:28:44.720 --> 03:28:48.000]  The governor of Texas is saying I can understand people's concerns so I'm going to deploy the
[03:28:48.000 --> 03:28:52.280]  National Guard to make sure that the army, the military doesn't get out of control.
[03:28:52.280 --> 03:28:54.080]  Is that a little too far?
[03:28:54.080 --> 03:28:55.080]  Well, I don't know.
[03:28:55.080 --> 03:28:56.680]  It's a little excessive.
[03:28:56.680 --> 03:28:57.680]  A little.
[03:28:57.680 --> 03:29:01.680]  But the thing is obviously he has a constituency that is really giving him a panic attack about
[03:29:01.680 --> 03:29:07.000]  this because they're probably very vocal minority that feels that this is the case.
[03:29:07.000 --> 03:29:08.000]  So they're going to be calling him.
[03:29:08.000 --> 03:29:09.000]  They're going to be emailing.
[03:29:09.000 --> 03:29:13.040]  I don't know if they said that on a Sunday show, tiny vocal minority, it's a talking
[03:29:13.040 --> 03:29:14.040]  point.
[03:29:14.040 --> 03:29:15.040]  It's a talking point.
[03:29:15.040 --> 03:29:16.040]  They were breaking.
[03:29:16.040 --> 03:29:17.040]  It says 45 percent.
[03:29:17.040 --> 03:29:19.280]  Maybe I shouldn't stay out long with them because they'll claim I didn't show up for
[03:29:19.280 --> 03:29:20.280]  that and cancel it.
[03:29:20.280 --> 03:29:22.160]  Better armed than most of our military.
[03:29:22.160 --> 03:29:26.280]  Maybe go for a blue state with all the gun laws that are about like California or Vermont
[03:29:26.280 --> 03:29:27.680]  or Washington, something like that.
[03:29:27.680 --> 03:29:29.160]  That's the one to shoot.
[03:29:29.160 --> 03:29:30.160]  Back her up.
[03:29:30.160 --> 03:29:34.760]  As if we said they're physically taking over, she's like they pick an easier state.
[03:29:34.760 --> 03:29:37.440]  They're just, do they show anything we have to say?
[03:29:37.440 --> 03:29:43.000]  They just make crap up a lot of their victim audience of, I'm sorry, elderly people on
[03:29:43.000 --> 03:29:44.000]  dialysis.
[03:29:44.000 --> 03:29:46.680]  I mean, that's, they're talking to people barely hanging on for lives who think, you
[03:29:46.680 --> 03:29:52.200]  know, that nice young lady exposed that we're going to go to Alex when we come back, Alex
[03:29:52.200 --> 03:29:55.960]  Smith and Sean GCN radio network, I'm afraid I'll run out of here.
[03:29:55.960 --> 03:29:57.880]  Oh, I'm not going on here.
[03:29:57.880 --> 03:29:59.600]  I'm afraid.
[03:29:59.600 --> 03:30:01.560]  What's your health worth to you?
[03:30:01.560 --> 03:30:05.560]  You probably can't place an exact value on it, but its importance has certainly increased
[03:30:05.560 --> 03:30:07.080]  greatly as you've grown older.
[03:30:07.080 --> 03:30:11.720]  Yet some companies seem to believe you can be lured in with cheap prices and false promises.
[03:30:11.720 --> 03:30:15.360]  That's never been the way supernatural silver has chosen to do business.
[03:30:15.360 --> 03:30:20.120]  Long ago we set out to create a product that was light years beyond colloidal and ionic
[03:30:20.120 --> 03:30:21.120]  silver.
[03:30:21.120 --> 03:30:25.560]  Through extensive research and testing, we succeeded in making supernatural silver hundreds
[03:30:25.560 --> 03:30:27.160]  of times more effective.

[03:30:44.040 --> 03:30:47.080]  results than the daily use of those bargain silvers.

[03:31:59.120 --> 03:32:01.880]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[03:32:01.880 --> 03:32:03.520]  Are we going to see economic growth?
[03:32:03.520 --> 03:32:05.920]  Slide into a recession or at worst, depression.
[03:32:05.920 --> 03:32:08.320]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[03:32:08.320 --> 03:32:12.600]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety
[03:32:12.600 --> 03:32:13.600]  is prudent.
[03:32:13.600 --> 03:32:16.880]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S. Treasuries are a safe haven.
[03:32:16.880 --> 03:32:21.800]  But what do you do when the U.S. government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[03:32:21.800 --> 03:32:26.000]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common sense alternative to traditional paper
[03:32:26.000 --> 03:32:27.000]  investments.
[03:32:27.000 --> 03:32:31.920]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled Ten Reasons to Own Gold, discussing
[03:32:31.920 --> 03:32:36.400]  costs, benefits, risks, featuring full color illustrations, weights, and measures.
[03:32:36.400 --> 03:32:41.760]  The book is free and can be yours by calling 800-686-2237.
[03:32:41.760 --> 03:32:45.360]  Paper investments are dwarfed by gold's 6,000 year history.
[03:32:45.360 --> 03:32:51.640]  Remember how gold may be right for you and your IRA by calling 800-686-2237.
[03:32:51.640 --> 03:32:55.000]  Whether buying or it's time for you to sell, the book is free.
[03:32:55.000 --> 03:33:24.800]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:33:25.000 --> 03:33:30.760]  I'm afraid of ABC and the media, and the side, they say I'm afraid, I'm afraid to go on
[03:33:30.760 --> 03:33:31.760]  air.
[03:33:31.760 --> 03:33:36.000]  That's why I take on the globalist and the new owner, do all this, Anthony, you've got
[03:33:36.000 --> 03:33:37.400]  to protect me from them.
[03:33:37.400 --> 03:33:40.880]  Oh my gosh, no, no, again, they're scared to have me on these shows.
[03:33:40.880 --> 03:33:43.400]  That's why, I mean, I'll go on Fox any time.
[03:33:43.400 --> 03:33:47.760]  I've been next door, supposed to go on the Paulitano show back when he had one, and glim
[03:33:47.760 --> 03:33:52.840]  back through a fit like four years ago, I'd been on the view that morning and CNN, like
[03:33:52.840 --> 03:33:57.400]  the Bayhar show or whatever name was, and then, but I'd flown to New York to be on Fox
[03:33:57.400 --> 03:33:59.080]  and they said, no, you can't come on.
[03:33:59.080 --> 03:34:01.760]  It's Fox that's afraid to have me on.
[03:34:01.760 --> 03:34:07.080]  And maybe somebody out there can search engine, if you actually look in our phone directory,
[03:34:07.080 --> 03:34:11.840]  we have the phone numbers of Fox producers that are still good, and so we have their
[03:34:11.840 --> 03:34:19.000]  internal phone numbers, but New York, New York, call them and say the five below Riley,
[03:34:19.000 --> 03:34:20.000]  any of them.
[03:34:20.000 --> 03:34:23.640]  They're ready to come on and quote Eisenhower and talk about why this is dangerous, but
[03:34:23.640 --> 03:34:24.640]  see, they can't have that.
[03:34:24.640 --> 03:34:25.640]  So they got to say, I'm scared.
[03:34:25.640 --> 03:34:30.840]  So I'm ready to, I'm ready to fly to New York, do a New York tour and go on all these shows.
[03:34:30.840 --> 03:34:37.920]  Two, one, two, five, six, six, three, four, six, three, call Fox and say, we want Alex
[03:34:37.920 --> 03:34:43.720]  Jones on tweet at Fox at their main Twitter, tweet at the five and say, I want to come
[03:34:43.720 --> 03:34:44.720]  on.
[03:34:44.720 --> 03:34:47.720]  Same thing for this week with George Snotknoes, Nopinophilus.
[03:34:47.720 --> 03:34:53.600]  Okay, two, one, two, five, six, six, three, four, six, three.
[03:34:53.600 --> 03:34:54.600]  I'm ready.
[03:34:54.600 --> 03:34:56.280]  In fact, in fact, I'm sick of these calories.
[03:34:56.280 --> 03:35:00.000]  I'm ready to fly to New York City or DC right now, but I want to be in studio with them
[03:35:00.000 --> 03:35:01.000]  like Pierce Morgan.
[03:35:01.000 --> 03:35:03.120]  Now they know I'll dominate.
[03:35:03.120 --> 03:35:06.200]  That's why they won't do it because they're sacks of chicken crap.
[03:35:06.200 --> 03:35:10.440]  And they know that I would dominate them with just history.
[03:35:10.440 --> 03:35:12.800]  And here's this article about them training for the Patriots.
[03:35:12.800 --> 03:35:13.800]  And here's this one.
[03:35:13.800 --> 03:35:15.520]  And then there's this film about them taking the guns.
[03:35:15.520 --> 03:35:17.000]  And then here's Eisenhower warned us.
[03:35:17.000 --> 03:35:18.880]  I mean, countries could take over by the military all the time.
[03:35:18.880 --> 03:35:19.880]  I'm not blaming the troops.
[03:35:19.880 --> 03:35:20.880]  I'm blaming policy.
[03:35:20.880 --> 03:35:22.880]  Look at Obama opening the borders up.
[03:35:22.880 --> 03:35:23.880]  Everybody knows about this.
[03:35:23.880 --> 03:35:26.160]  I mean, I'll just blast them with truth.
[03:35:26.160 --> 03:35:28.560]  They call it the avalanche technique of debate.
[03:35:28.560 --> 03:35:29.560]  And then it's over.
[03:35:29.560 --> 03:35:31.760]  I will laugh at them when they laugh at me.
[03:35:31.760 --> 03:35:34.400]  I won't cower and play games with them.
[03:35:34.400 --> 03:35:38.800]  So they have to announce that I'm scared to go on with them and misrepresent that Texas
[03:35:38.800 --> 03:35:40.440]  has got a lot of guns.
[03:35:40.440 --> 03:35:42.160]  They ought to try to invade California.
[03:35:42.160 --> 03:35:47.160]  And somebody can laugh at Alex Jones and go, oh, he thought they tried to invade Texas
[03:35:47.160 --> 03:35:48.160]  and play card games.
[03:35:48.160 --> 03:35:49.160]  He'll never have them.
[03:35:49.160 --> 03:35:50.160]  Look out and do that.
[03:35:50.160 --> 03:35:51.160]  Okay.
[03:35:51.160 --> 03:35:58.080]  Porky Pig meets Gomer Pyle meets Foghorn Leghorn.
[03:35:58.080 --> 03:36:01.800]  I say, boy, I say, I say, get away from him, boy.
[03:36:01.800 --> 03:36:02.800]  You bother me.
[03:36:02.800 --> 03:36:06.840]  How about I come up to the five and I take all those ladies out at night?
[03:36:06.840 --> 03:36:11.640]  I mean, just take them out to dinner.
[03:36:11.640 --> 03:36:14.880]  And I will be there to chaperone the ladies and make sure they behave themselves.
[03:36:14.880 --> 03:36:15.880]  Because I'll go further.
[03:36:15.880 --> 03:36:21.480]  Ladies, I'm scared of ladies and I'm very scared to take you out to dinner.
[03:36:21.480 --> 03:36:25.800]  Of course, they're not really that attractive, but the point is, is that still I can tell
[03:36:25.800 --> 03:36:28.880]  you ladies haven't been around a real man in a while.
[03:36:28.880 --> 03:36:34.760]  And so let me just say, we'll all get a hotel room and we'll teach how to play tiddly winks.
[03:36:34.760 --> 03:36:35.760]  All right.
[03:36:35.760 --> 03:36:36.760]  I'm joking.
[03:36:36.760 --> 03:36:37.760]  It's a family show.
[03:36:37.760 --> 03:36:38.760]  I'm just joking.
[03:36:38.760 --> 03:36:39.760]  Have a little bit of fun.
[03:36:39.760 --> 03:36:40.760]  You'd cower in fear.
[03:36:40.760 --> 03:36:43.080]  And you know how I cower here.
[03:36:43.080 --> 03:36:44.080]  You would cower in fear.
[03:36:44.080 --> 03:36:47.080]  I would absolutely cower in fear.
[03:36:47.080 --> 03:36:50.640]  I love it.
[03:36:50.640 --> 03:36:52.440]  What other tricks do you think they're going to pull to claim?
[03:36:52.440 --> 03:36:54.400]  Because everybody says, why don't you have them on?
[03:36:54.400 --> 03:36:56.000]  So they just claim, I don't show up.
[03:36:56.000 --> 03:36:59.200]  Well, why don't they just say that we tried to invite him on, but he didn't respond?
[03:36:59.200 --> 03:37:00.200]  That might happen.
[03:37:00.200 --> 03:37:01.400]  Well, we tried to get him on.
[03:37:01.400 --> 03:37:03.600]  We sent him an email, but he didn't respond to us.
[03:37:03.600 --> 03:37:05.240]  He doesn't want to come on because he's a coward.
[03:37:05.240 --> 03:37:06.240]  That's how easy it is.
[03:37:06.240 --> 03:37:09.920]  Just like, oh, he didn't show up because we didn't actually send a car till 10 minutes
[03:37:09.920 --> 03:37:10.920]  before.
[03:37:10.920 --> 03:37:12.120]  So now he's a coward, quite frankly.
[03:37:12.120 --> 03:37:16.640]  And then notice, Fox News hates ABC News, yet they're backing them up.
[03:37:16.640 --> 03:37:21.680]  There's a unilateral push against the Jade Helm quote unquote conspiracy that is actually
[03:37:21.680 --> 03:37:23.000]  even happening now.
[03:37:23.000 --> 03:37:26.760]  And they're just all unified together, just like they did for Obama, just saying, this
[03:37:26.760 --> 03:37:28.200]  is really, this is really good.
[03:37:28.200 --> 03:37:29.200]  Jade Helm is great.
[03:37:29.200 --> 03:37:30.600]  Everyone who says it's bad is insane.
[03:37:30.600 --> 03:37:35.400]  And for the first time, Fox News now is going and quoting Stephanopoulos and talking about
[03:37:35.400 --> 03:37:36.400]  how great he is.
[03:37:36.400 --> 03:37:37.400]  Isn't that interesting?
[03:37:37.400 --> 03:37:40.760]  You can't even play that sensational clip of me making a joke about a hotel room with
[03:37:40.760 --> 03:37:41.760]  him.
[03:37:41.760 --> 03:37:44.360]  I'm giving him stuff right now, but they know it's so sensational.
[03:37:44.360 --> 03:37:48.240]  It gives us so much attention, but we already have a big audience that's growing.
[03:37:48.240 --> 03:37:52.560]  We don't need you, but I'll be happy to come on and mop the floor with you and your faux
[03:37:52.560 --> 03:37:53.560]  tough guy.
[03:37:53.560 --> 03:37:56.960]  In fact, I'll challenge that host to a boxing match, bare knuckle.
[03:37:56.960 --> 03:37:59.520]  I'm not, I mean, he looks like a pretty tough guy.
[03:37:59.520 --> 03:38:00.520]  Doesn't matter.
[03:38:00.520 --> 03:38:04.480]  I'll knock his teeth out and break his nose because I'm afraid.
[03:38:04.480 --> 03:38:07.600]  Get in the ring with me and I will stomp your ass into the ground.
[03:38:07.600 --> 03:38:11.360]  And let's do it in Vegas with all the proper stuff we give to the charity of you want.
[03:38:11.360 --> 03:38:13.360]  Cause I'm a coward.
[03:38:13.360 --> 03:38:14.360]  How's that sound?
[03:38:14.360 --> 03:38:15.360]  Hmm?
[03:38:15.360 --> 03:38:18.360]  I'd put a bet on that.
[03:38:18.360 --> 03:38:19.360]  Absolutely.
[03:38:19.360 --> 03:38:21.360]  But they're not real showmen.
[03:38:21.360 --> 03:38:27.480]  They're there for corporate executives to load their teleprompter like a pez dispenser.
[03:38:27.480 --> 03:38:29.760]  And then they just sit there and spout BS at people.
[03:38:29.760 --> 03:38:30.760]  Well, you could tell that too.
[03:38:30.760 --> 03:38:34.140]  Cause she kept messing up the words, you know, she was reading the teleprompter very quickly
[03:38:34.140 --> 03:38:37.920]  saying, you know, she sounds like she had helm and troops and such a foot long to chili
[03:38:37.920 --> 03:38:38.920]  dogs shoved in her mouth.
[03:38:38.920 --> 03:38:39.920]  Yeah.
[03:38:39.920 --> 03:38:40.920]  All right.
[03:38:40.920 --> 03:38:41.920]  I'm going to stop.
[03:38:41.920 --> 03:38:46.880]  I kind of get bad in the third hour, fourth hour, look out, start losing control.
[03:38:46.880 --> 03:38:52.280]  Let's go back to these idiots up their lines, their viewers over any state.
[03:38:52.280 --> 03:38:53.280]  It wouldn't be Texas.
[03:38:53.280 --> 03:38:56.920]  They are probably better off than most of our military baby.
[03:38:56.920 --> 03:38:57.920]  Go for it.
[03:38:57.920 --> 03:39:02.360]  With all the gun laws about California or Vermont or Washington, something like that.
[03:39:02.360 --> 03:39:03.360]  That's the one to shoot for.
[03:39:03.360 --> 03:39:06.280]  We just let Texas to see what I think with this kind of behavior.
[03:39:06.280 --> 03:39:09.720]  No, but the fact is the government has taken over some states.
[03:39:09.720 --> 03:39:10.720]  We know that.
[03:39:10.720 --> 03:39:11.720]  By the way, they're doing this.
[03:39:11.720 --> 03:39:12.720]  Which ones?
[03:39:12.720 --> 03:39:13.720]  They're doing this.
[03:39:13.720 --> 03:39:14.720]  I can name them, but I don't have time.
[03:39:14.720 --> 03:39:15.720]  Right.
[03:39:15.720 --> 03:39:18.200]  This is all being done to distract us from the chem trails.
[03:39:18.200 --> 03:39:19.800]  The chem trails are what's ruining us.
[03:39:19.800 --> 03:39:23.840]  By the way, the thing that kills me about conspiracy theorists is they believe that they
[03:39:23.840 --> 03:39:28.400]  reflects like at a higher intelligence or a higher skepticism or a sense of awareness.
[03:39:28.400 --> 03:39:31.760]  When in fact, every conspiracy theorist you know is gullible.
[03:39:31.760 --> 03:39:35.360]  They're the guys that always forward you with the email that's been forwarded a thousand
[03:39:35.360 --> 03:39:36.360]  times.
[03:39:36.360 --> 03:39:37.360]  I'm just saying.
[03:39:37.360 --> 03:39:38.360]  I'm just saying.
[03:39:38.360 --> 03:39:39.360]  You've got to line me.
[03:39:39.360 --> 03:39:40.360]  You've got to speculate.
[03:39:40.360 --> 03:39:41.360]  A lot of it's going to be wrong.
[03:39:41.360 --> 03:39:42.360]  But not from us.
[03:39:42.360 --> 03:39:43.360]  And they're so insulting.
[03:39:43.360 --> 03:39:44.360]  Show us what we did was wrong.
[03:39:44.360 --> 03:39:50.440]  Saying that what happened in Boston, the bodies were still fresh, was a false flag
[03:39:50.440 --> 03:39:53.080]  operation performed by the FBI.
[03:39:53.080 --> 03:39:56.560]  While these people are mourning their death, they're the worst and they're the most gullible
[03:39:56.560 --> 03:39:58.480]  and the dumbest people, I can't stand them.
[03:39:58.480 --> 03:40:02.200]  I just don't like that they show everyone's email on there instead of right.
[03:40:02.200 --> 03:40:03.200]  That's the most.
[03:40:03.200 --> 03:40:04.200]  Oh, you're mad about the forwarded email.
[03:40:04.200 --> 03:40:05.200]  Oh, yeah.
[03:40:05.200 --> 03:40:08.200]  So, Dana, you work for a guy who's the governor of Texas.
[03:40:08.200 --> 03:40:09.800]  Now we forwarded everyone's email.
[03:40:09.800 --> 03:40:11.400]  Well, you know, I'm confused about something.
[03:40:11.400 --> 03:40:13.080]  Oh, we didn't even say the FBI.
[03:40:13.080 --> 03:40:14.840]  We said we don't know.
[03:40:14.840 --> 03:40:17.320]  These brothers were under CIA control that came out in the news.
[03:40:17.320 --> 03:40:20.160]  There was a drill that was clearly a stand down.
[03:40:20.160 --> 03:40:21.480]  There's a cover up.
[03:40:21.480 --> 03:40:22.480]  Something's going on.
[03:40:22.480 --> 03:40:27.360]  How is it a conspiracy theory that's bad for the federal military to come into Texas
[03:40:27.360 --> 03:40:32.040]  as a state and do training again and then interact in civilian clothes doing simulated
[03:40:32.040 --> 03:40:37.720]  illegal things while we have new video training to confiscate guns in South Carolina?
[03:40:37.720 --> 03:40:40.720]  I'll tell you why, though, because it's an emotion-backed response that he just gave
[03:40:40.720 --> 03:40:44.880]  to that by saying people are crazy and chemtrails and Hitler and Boston and talking about victims
[03:40:44.880 --> 03:40:46.200]  dying and crying.
[03:40:46.200 --> 03:40:47.200]  That therefore.
[03:40:47.200 --> 03:40:48.720]  How dare him not like the victims?
[03:40:48.720 --> 03:40:50.320]  How dare him not like the troops?
[03:40:50.320 --> 03:40:55.040]  You could, I could go into a mall, right, and I could watch someone shoot five people
[03:40:55.040 --> 03:40:59.840]  and then the cops question me, I can't, you know, if I was a complicitant, I can't talk.
[03:40:59.840 --> 03:41:00.840]  There were so many dead victims.
[03:41:00.840 --> 03:41:02.160]  It just hurt me so bad.
[03:41:02.160 --> 03:41:05.840]  Okay, okay, you know, you're not allowed to talk about anything any further.
[03:41:05.840 --> 03:41:09.560]  If you say, well, people are crying and there was victims and there was bloodshed.
[03:41:09.560 --> 03:41:11.240]  That just derails any argument.
[03:41:11.240 --> 03:41:13.040]  That's why 9-11 is so successful.
[03:41:13.040 --> 03:41:14.040]  People died.
[03:41:14.040 --> 03:41:15.040]  It's so sad.
[03:41:15.040 --> 03:41:16.040]  Of course it is.
[03:41:16.040 --> 03:41:17.040]  Of course it's sad.
[03:41:17.040 --> 03:41:18.680]  What was that Ben Affleck movie that just came out that was so good?
[03:41:18.680 --> 03:41:20.200]  I don't even like Affleck.
[03:41:20.200 --> 03:41:22.240]  He's a horrible gong girl.
[03:41:22.240 --> 03:41:23.880]  But in that, like, she's been through a lot.
[03:41:23.880 --> 03:41:26.320]  She can't talk to the detectives right now.
[03:41:26.320 --> 03:41:29.200]  That's the perfect example.
[03:41:29.200 --> 03:41:33.640]  And after basically not to give the whole, who cares, but anyway, basically this woman
[03:41:33.640 --> 03:41:37.080]  is a long story, but she had committed the crime she was guilty of and they were asking
[03:41:37.080 --> 03:41:38.080]  about it.
[03:41:38.080 --> 03:41:39.080]  And she, I'm just so sad.
[03:41:39.080 --> 03:41:40.080]  Don't you understand?
[03:41:40.080 --> 03:41:43.440]  I'm in emotional distress and the, okay, let's, let's let her go, guys.
[03:41:43.440 --> 03:41:47.920]  That's all they did was in Texas, tough army couldn't take them.
[03:41:47.920 --> 03:41:49.240]  Everything is to manipulate their audience.
[03:41:49.240 --> 03:41:50.440]  Why is John Stuart so big?
[03:41:50.440 --> 03:41:53.640]  It's because he's not actually sitting there spewing facts and information.
[03:41:53.640 --> 03:41:58.480]  He's making an emotional mockery of it, which then says to your body, okay, this is just
[03:41:58.480 --> 03:41:59.480]  funny.
[03:41:59.480 --> 03:42:02.400]  It's like if you're an argument, the best way to diffuse an argument in a relationship
[03:42:02.400 --> 03:42:06.440]  is to make a joke and enlighten the spirits, not to actually logically conclude the.
[03:42:06.440 --> 03:42:08.600]  I know you can be in arguments with women and just make a joke.
[03:42:08.600 --> 03:42:09.600]  Yeah.
[03:42:09.600 --> 03:42:10.920]  Don't, don't, don't, don't have the argument.
[03:42:10.920 --> 03:42:11.920]  Just make a joke about it.
[03:42:11.920 --> 03:42:12.920]  That's the old thing.
[03:42:12.920 --> 03:42:13.920]  Don't listen, listen.
[03:42:13.920 --> 03:42:14.920]  I was, I was joking around earlier.
[03:42:14.920 --> 03:42:20.760]  I would actually like to go up to Fox, the five, take, I'll take them all out to dinner.
[03:42:20.760 --> 03:42:24.320]  And then if both those guys want to get in a bare-knuckle box match with me, I'm serious,
[03:42:24.320 --> 03:42:28.200]  I'll challenge them both to a fight, since I'm such a coward.
[03:42:28.200 --> 03:42:30.560]  And you'll cower in fear in the, in the match.
[03:42:30.560 --> 03:42:33.800]  If any of these guys ever call me on it, I'm going to go and get in the ring with them.
[03:42:33.800 --> 03:42:35.800]  Hey, forget Mayweather versus Pacquiao.
[03:42:35.800 --> 03:42:36.800]  This is the fight of 2015.
[03:42:36.800 --> 03:42:37.800]  Yeah.
[03:42:37.800 --> 03:42:38.800]  I'm not going to be holding them.
[03:42:38.800 --> 03:42:40.800]  I'm not going to be moving out of the way.
[03:42:40.800 --> 03:42:41.800]  Yeah.
[03:42:41.800 --> 03:42:44.800]  I'm going to come up and want to get hit in the head to turn it on.
[03:42:44.800 --> 03:42:49.320]  Just challenge all your enemies to a boxing match.
[03:42:49.320 --> 03:42:53.240]  Oh, I'm just doing it as a joke, because then, remember on Pierce Morgan, they said, no,
[03:42:53.240 --> 03:42:54.240]  we're going to kill you.
[03:42:54.240 --> 03:42:55.240]  Yeah, yeah, I know.
[03:42:55.240 --> 03:42:56.240]  Yeah.
[03:42:56.240 --> 03:42:57.240]  They said, oh, I'd like to take a gun out and shoot him, but that's okay though.
[03:42:57.240 --> 03:43:00.160]  That's okay that they said that, but could you imagine if you said that?
[03:43:00.160 --> 03:43:02.560]  Well, she said, we'll do it wearing a uniform.
[03:43:02.560 --> 03:43:03.560]  Yeah.
[03:43:03.560 --> 03:43:07.520]  The ambassador's daughter, and they're all, oh, yeah, oh, let's go.
[03:43:07.520 --> 03:43:09.760]  As if wearing a uniform gives them some kind of power.
[03:43:09.760 --> 03:43:13.400]  It's okay if you do anything as long as you're in a uniform.
[03:43:13.400 --> 03:43:14.400]  Absolutely.
[03:43:14.400 --> 03:43:19.160]  Let's, uh, a lot of those guys look like they're in a uniform.
[03:43:19.160 --> 03:43:21.760]  Like they probably wear like ice cream truck uniforms.
[03:43:21.760 --> 03:43:26.720]  Uh, let's go, yeah, let's go, women have puppies in the back.
[03:43:26.720 --> 03:43:27.720]  Let's go.
[03:43:27.720 --> 03:43:28.720]  Lollipops.
[03:43:28.720 --> 03:43:31.240]  Uh, anyways, let's go ahead and go back to the club.
[03:43:31.240 --> 03:43:32.240]  Here it is.
[03:43:32.240 --> 03:43:33.240]  Alexis, could you imagine?
[03:43:33.240 --> 03:43:38.720]  No, and I actually think that, I think that the setup for those, for Cruz and, and Perry
[03:43:38.720 --> 03:43:39.720]  and even talking about Alex.
[03:43:39.720 --> 03:43:40.720]  Since she's on medication.
[03:43:40.720 --> 03:43:45.360]  I actually think that they're in a position of responsibility to give some tough love.
[03:43:45.360 --> 03:43:46.360]  So.
[03:43:46.360 --> 03:43:47.360]  Yeah.
[03:43:47.360 --> 03:43:48.360]  But you just said about Alex Jones.
[03:43:48.360 --> 03:43:49.360]  Yeah.
[03:43:49.360 --> 03:43:50.360]  This is not true.
[03:43:50.360 --> 03:43:51.960]  That actually should have come from them.
[03:43:51.960 --> 03:43:52.960]  I agree.
[03:43:52.960 --> 03:43:53.960]  They're saying the talking point.
[03:43:53.960 --> 03:43:58.480]  Five, we can, we're, we're, we're, we are nobody, but if you're in a position of elected
[03:43:58.480 --> 03:43:59.480]  leadership.
[03:43:59.480 --> 03:44:00.800]  Back it up.
[03:44:00.800 --> 03:44:05.240]  They're saying call Alex Jones a nut job denounce him.
[03:44:05.240 --> 03:44:06.560]  This is the new litmus test.
[03:44:06.560 --> 03:44:08.080]  Well, that's a great way to attack.
[03:44:08.080 --> 03:44:12.720]  So like when the enemies got you chained down torturing you, denounce him.
[03:44:12.720 --> 03:44:16.360]  And usually it's like the show whose name we will not utter.
[03:44:16.360 --> 03:44:21.280]  Why, because I'm going to show you government documents at army.mil where they're trending
[03:44:21.280 --> 03:44:26.000]  to take your guns and take your town over the old, I mean, they don't like that.
[03:44:26.000 --> 03:44:30.360]  The ultimate form of flattery is not mentioning you by name when they actually have to mention
[03:44:30.360 --> 03:44:31.360]  you by name.
[03:44:31.360 --> 03:44:34.600]  It means they're so desperate that they now are forcing other people to denounce you by
[03:44:34.600 --> 03:44:35.600]  attacking them.
[03:44:35.600 --> 03:44:36.600]  That's their strength.
[03:44:36.600 --> 03:44:37.840]  Well, they're saying listen to that.
[03:44:37.840 --> 03:44:39.520]  They've been saying denounce me for five weeks.
[03:44:39.520 --> 03:44:40.520]  It's a threat.
[03:44:40.520 --> 03:44:44.280]  It's saying, look, guys, look, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, everybody denounce Alex Jones, we're
[03:44:44.280 --> 03:44:45.480]  going to keep attacking you.
[03:44:45.480 --> 03:44:47.640]  Even Fox News is not going to be on your side.
[03:44:47.640 --> 03:44:51.480]  You're we're unilaterally going to push against you as a media conglomerate if you do not
[03:44:51.480 --> 03:44:52.480]  do.
[03:44:52.480 --> 03:44:55.640]  And I'm told the other shows are all doing it denounce him, denounce him, denounce him.
[03:44:55.640 --> 03:44:57.640]  You want to denounce me like a body section?
[03:44:57.640 --> 03:44:58.640]  You want to do it?
[03:44:58.640 --> 03:45:00.440]  Go ahead and do it.
[03:45:00.440 --> 03:45:04.480]  I need to just actually what I need to do is it needs to be, I need to sit here with
[03:45:04.480 --> 03:45:09.240]  my thumbs up or down like a gladiatorial trial and just put my thumbs down.
[03:45:09.240 --> 03:45:10.720]  Just cower in fear.
[03:45:10.720 --> 03:45:14.040]  I just love that they say I'm afraid.
[03:45:14.040 --> 03:45:18.720]  Oh, you're absolutely afraid, obviously, sitting here challenging them to a boxing match, let
[03:45:18.720 --> 03:45:19.720]  alone an interview.
[03:45:19.720 --> 03:45:23.640]  I think you're obviously desperately afraid of them not to mention what's the whole you've
[03:45:23.640 --> 03:45:24.640]  been on those shows.
[03:45:24.640 --> 03:45:25.640]  Countless times.
[03:45:25.640 --> 03:45:26.640]  It was funny to me.
[03:45:26.640 --> 03:45:27.640]  You're on the view.
[03:45:27.640 --> 03:45:32.320]  I mean, you know, you've been on the mainstream media television programs over and over again.
[03:45:32.320 --> 03:45:33.640]  It's not like it's some big deal.
[03:45:33.640 --> 03:45:36.840]  They act like it's I'm like well known for showing up to everything like he won't be
[03:45:36.840 --> 03:45:37.840]  on ABC.
[03:45:37.840 --> 03:45:38.840]  Oh my goodness.
[03:45:38.840 --> 03:45:43.000]  You know, it's not even that big, which meant to me like I'm hiding under the table and
[03:45:43.000 --> 03:45:44.240]  I'm afraid to defend myself.
[03:45:44.240 --> 03:45:45.240]  Right.
[03:45:45.240 --> 03:45:46.720]  But your voice is every single day on the radio.
[03:45:46.720 --> 03:45:47.800]  Why don't they talk about that?
[03:45:47.800 --> 03:45:51.240]  They don't actually want to talk about anything you say and you'll notice that I've never
[03:45:51.240 --> 03:45:52.320]  seen one time.
[03:45:52.320 --> 03:45:55.400]  Not one time have they actually played a full clip from your show where you're actually
[03:45:55.400 --> 03:45:57.640]  reaching your conclusion and beginning your conclusion.
[03:45:57.640 --> 03:46:00.280]  They always take a little snippet that makes you sense.
[03:46:00.280 --> 03:46:01.800]  It's like an invasion map.
[03:46:01.800 --> 03:46:02.800]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:46:02.800 --> 03:46:04.280]  Clip, you know.
[03:46:04.280 --> 03:46:08.880]  But everyone else gets the justice of at least 30 seconds of a clip and they know they can
[03:46:08.880 --> 03:46:10.520]  use 30 seconds.
[03:46:10.520 --> 03:46:11.520]  They could use two minutes.
[03:46:11.520 --> 03:46:15.280]  Who wouldn't even play the whole Ted Cruz re-says people don't trust Obama and why?
[03:46:15.280 --> 03:46:16.480]  They don't want to give any credibility.
[03:46:16.480 --> 03:46:18.600]  I mean, Obama's power grabbing everything.
[03:46:18.600 --> 03:46:23.240]  Here, here, let's go back to the clip and then to your calls Alex and others.
[03:46:23.240 --> 03:46:24.760]  That actually should have come from them.
[03:46:24.760 --> 03:46:25.760]  I agree.
[03:46:25.760 --> 03:46:26.760]  That's not from the five.
[03:46:26.760 --> 03:46:30.480]  I mean the five, we can, we're who are we, we are nobody, but if you're in a position
[03:46:30.480 --> 03:46:31.480]  of elected leadership.
[03:46:31.480 --> 03:46:32.480]  Good pause.
[03:46:32.480 --> 03:46:33.480]  Back it up 10 seconds.
[03:46:33.480 --> 03:46:34.480]  Who are you?
[03:46:34.480 --> 03:46:38.040]  You're the former propagandist for George W. Bush, Perino or Perina or whatever your name
[03:46:38.040 --> 03:46:39.040]  is.
[03:46:39.040 --> 03:46:40.040]  Dog food is your name.
[03:46:40.040 --> 03:46:44.920]  Lady, lady, if you want to ride my Mercedes, I'm sorry.
[03:46:44.920 --> 03:46:51.480]  The point is, and I'm quotes her makes a lot, the point is I saw you get up and say there
[03:46:51.480 --> 03:46:56.960]  was no inflation or there was no dollar devaluation when the dollar lost 30% of its value like
[03:46:56.960 --> 03:46:57.960]  eight, nine years ago.
[03:46:57.960 --> 03:47:03.040]  I mean, you are a consummate BS artist who will read off a teleprompter.
[03:47:03.040 --> 03:47:04.720]  You are nobody.
[03:47:04.720 --> 03:47:06.480]  Let's get that straight ding dong.
[03:47:06.480 --> 03:47:09.360]  And by the way, I'm ready to be attacked by all these Republicans.
[03:47:09.360 --> 03:47:13.120]  Do you know why these Republicans are the leaders of the pack?
[03:47:13.120 --> 03:47:15.920]  And why Abbott won so big?
[03:47:15.920 --> 03:47:21.600]  Because their constituents have read the army documents and the news articles admitting
[03:47:21.600 --> 03:47:24.080]  the military is trying to take on the Patriots.
[03:47:24.080 --> 03:47:28.800]  So keep shoving lies at your audience, Jackasses.
[03:47:28.800 --> 03:47:33.240]  Please folks, call Fox news, tweet them, tell them I'm ready right now.
[03:47:33.240 --> 03:47:36.680]  They're like, oh yeah, you really want to be on our show?
[03:47:36.680 --> 03:47:38.200]  Actually yeah, I would get a lot of publicity out of it.
[03:47:38.200 --> 03:47:41.080]  I just have a three million viewers, but they didn't be in big news.
[03:47:41.080 --> 03:47:44.080]  In fact, I really should have just submitted.
[03:47:44.080 --> 03:47:45.580]  I had a plan.
[03:47:45.580 --> 03:47:46.580]  I said, I'll only do live.
[03:47:46.580 --> 03:47:47.580]  They said, sure.
[03:47:47.580 --> 03:47:48.580]  Of course, can be live.
[03:47:48.580 --> 03:47:52.000]  And then the day before two days before on Friday on this week, they said, oh, it's gonna
[03:47:52.000 --> 03:47:53.000]  be taped now.
[03:47:53.000 --> 03:47:54.000]  We'll pick you up at eight.
[03:47:54.000 --> 03:47:55.000]  We'll tape at 830.
[03:47:55.000 --> 03:47:56.000]  And then there is it.
[03:47:56.000 --> 03:47:57.000]  You know, I was like, okay, whatever.
[03:47:57.000 --> 03:47:58.000]  Next thing.
[03:47:58.000 --> 03:47:59.000]  We're gonna pick you up at six.
[03:47:59.000 --> 03:48:00.000]  These are the emails.
[03:48:00.000 --> 03:48:01.000]  We put them out.
[03:48:01.000 --> 03:48:05.320]  And we're like, I'm like, I told Niko, I said, no, tell them it's just, you know, basically
[03:48:05.320 --> 03:48:07.160]  I'll do the eight or I'll do the thing live.
[03:48:07.160 --> 03:48:08.160]  I'm done.
[03:48:08.160 --> 03:48:09.160]  You're back.
[03:48:09.160 --> 03:48:10.160]  So I'm done.
[03:48:10.160 --> 03:48:14.520]  Then they send a car to be live 12 minutes before airtime.
[03:48:14.520 --> 03:48:16.960]  We couldn't even have probably gotten to the studio.
[03:48:16.960 --> 03:48:20.320]  I'm in my underwear.
[03:48:20.320 --> 03:48:23.680]  My kids have just gotten up wandering around saying, cook me breakfast.
[03:48:23.680 --> 03:48:25.800]  I looked at my daughters.
[03:48:25.800 --> 03:48:28.160]  They were asking for food.
[03:48:28.160 --> 03:48:29.760]  There's nobody there to keep the kids.
[03:48:29.760 --> 03:48:31.800]  I told them, I guess I'm not doing.
[03:48:31.800 --> 03:48:34.760]  And so no, I'm not going.
[03:48:34.760 --> 03:48:38.040]  But see how they just, it's just, it's just ridiculous.
[03:48:38.040 --> 03:48:39.040]  Weird.
[03:48:39.040 --> 03:48:42.880]  Let's go back to the club and position responsibility to give some tough love.
[03:48:42.880 --> 03:48:48.040]  So yeah, but you just said about Alex Jones, that job, this is not true.
[03:48:48.040 --> 03:48:49.560]  That actually should have come from them.
[03:48:49.560 --> 03:48:50.560]  I agree.
[03:48:50.560 --> 03:48:51.560]  That should not from the five.
[03:48:51.560 --> 03:48:52.560]  I mean, the five.
[03:48:52.560 --> 03:48:53.560]  She doesn't tough.
[03:48:53.560 --> 03:48:54.560]  We are.
[03:48:54.560 --> 03:48:55.560]  We are.
[03:48:55.560 --> 03:48:56.560]  We are.
[03:48:56.560 --> 03:48:57.560]  We are nobody.
[03:48:57.560 --> 03:48:59.400]  But if you're in a position of elected leadership, don't remind him, please.
[03:48:59.400 --> 03:49:00.400]  It's fragile.
[03:49:00.400 --> 03:49:03.600]  Well, I have to say, Rick Perry to his credit called it like for, for what it is.
[03:49:03.600 --> 03:49:04.600]  He basically said, this is nuts.
[03:49:04.600 --> 03:49:10.720]  Rick Perry, congratulations actually stood up, oh no, you gave us a tree seal who came
[03:49:10.720 --> 03:49:12.680]  out and said, this is crazy.
[03:49:12.680 --> 03:49:13.680]  And then we should hit pause.
[03:49:13.680 --> 03:49:14.680]  I'm going to stand for them.
[03:49:14.680 --> 03:49:15.680]  Okay.
[03:49:15.680 --> 03:49:22.440]  Just close shot on the camera on me for you.
[03:49:22.440 --> 03:49:26.640]  Please throw me a fish or I'll bounce a ball on my nose.
[03:49:26.640 --> 03:49:28.920]  There's no police state, no NSA spying.
[03:49:28.920 --> 03:49:33.320]  The military is not trained to take over the United States in hundreds of news articles.
[03:49:33.320 --> 03:49:34.480]  It's fine.
[03:49:34.480 --> 03:49:35.480]  And I apologize.
[03:49:35.480 --> 03:49:36.480]  Jane Helms.
[03:49:36.480 --> 03:49:37.480]  No big deal.
[03:49:37.480 --> 03:49:41.160]  Now give me a fish, Fox News will probably play that clip.
[03:49:41.160 --> 03:49:42.320]  I don't care.
[03:49:42.320 --> 03:49:43.680]  All it does is bring me more audience.
[03:49:43.680 --> 03:49:49.160]  They find the truth, slime balls, the truth, Trump's piles of steaming, traitorous cowardice
[03:49:49.160 --> 03:49:50.160]  filth.
[03:49:50.160 --> 03:49:52.920]  I'll never be a coward like you.
[03:49:52.920 --> 03:49:57.320]  No matter what stunt you pull, and that's why neither one of you little punks will get
[03:49:57.320 --> 03:49:58.320]  in the ring with me.
[03:49:58.320 --> 03:50:00.880]  Now let's go ahead and go back to the clip.
[03:50:00.880 --> 03:50:04.600]  I understand the skepticism after all, since we do have a Kenyan born president.
[03:50:04.600 --> 03:50:05.600]  That's true.
[03:50:05.600 --> 03:50:06.600]  I've been to Kenya and I saw his home.
[03:50:06.600 --> 03:50:07.600]  It was such a good segment.
[03:50:07.600 --> 03:50:08.600]  What's that?
[03:50:08.600 --> 03:50:09.600]  All the bullets, the whole man's tray of cakes.
[03:50:09.600 --> 03:50:10.600]  I'm back.
[03:50:10.600 --> 03:50:11.600]  I'm back.
[03:50:11.600 --> 03:50:12.600]  One more thing.
[03:50:12.600 --> 03:50:13.600]  There you go.
[03:50:13.600 --> 03:50:14.600]  That was it.
[03:50:14.600 --> 03:50:15.600]  It was actually such a good segment.
[03:50:15.600 --> 03:50:19.360]  We're back in high school where we laugh.
[03:50:19.360 --> 03:50:22.960]  Where we laugh at the kid that's in astronomy class, the mathematician who'll end up owning
[03:50:22.960 --> 03:50:26.040]  the computer company.
[03:50:26.040 --> 03:50:27.040]  We never grew up.
[03:50:27.040 --> 03:50:28.040]  We just laugh.
[03:50:28.040 --> 03:50:31.840]  I'm skipping this final network break.
[03:50:31.840 --> 03:50:33.520]  I'm shook up right now.
[03:50:33.520 --> 03:50:36.480]  See, let me tell you something, guys, that we're all teleporometers.
[03:50:36.480 --> 03:50:37.800]  I built this company.
[03:50:37.800 --> 03:50:38.800]  I run this.
[03:50:38.800 --> 03:50:39.800]  I call the shots.
[03:50:39.800 --> 03:50:43.880]  I skip network breaks when I want to and lose $3,000, $4,000.
[03:50:43.880 --> 03:50:45.320]  Do you get to do that?
[03:50:45.320 --> 03:50:48.120]  No, because you're not your own man.
[03:50:48.120 --> 03:50:49.680]  You're not a trailblazer.
[03:50:49.680 --> 03:50:51.320]  You're not an American.
[03:50:51.320 --> 03:50:57.400]  You're a collaborating sack of crap.
[03:50:57.400 --> 03:51:00.280]  I want to go to these calls.
[03:51:00.280 --> 03:51:03.360]  But Anthony, any comments you have, we'll go to the calls.
[03:51:03.360 --> 03:51:07.440]  What does it mean when all of these media groups that apparently hate each other are
[03:51:07.440 --> 03:51:11.800]  coming together and just attacking you and forcing everyone to denounce you or else with
[03:51:11.800 --> 03:51:13.160]  all these weird threats?
[03:51:13.160 --> 03:51:18.560]  Does it mean that they are so desperate now that they know it's big?
[03:51:18.560 --> 03:51:23.880]  And perhaps it's because they're preemptively attacking you before 2016 elections as they
[03:51:23.880 --> 03:51:29.400]  know you have a big voice in it and they want to disarm you to ensure that you actually
[03:51:29.400 --> 03:51:33.320]  in their plan, which it won't work, to try and ensure that you don't have a voice in
[03:51:33.320 --> 03:51:34.320]  the 2016 elections.
[03:51:34.320 --> 03:51:38.680]  Well, you know how it is for Emperor Palpatine when he's under attack and he needs help?
[03:51:38.680 --> 03:51:40.520]  He gets more powerful.
[03:51:40.520 --> 03:51:45.680]  These people are such little cowards.
[03:51:45.680 --> 03:51:46.680]  I love it.
[03:51:46.680 --> 03:51:49.200]  They don't get I'm enjoying all of this.
[03:51:49.200 --> 03:51:51.560]  Because they think- Good, good.
[03:51:51.560 --> 03:51:56.480]  They think in the mindset of a corporate drone reporter, where if they mess up, they get
[03:51:56.480 --> 03:51:58.840]  fired or whatever happens, you don't care.
[03:51:58.840 --> 03:52:02.160]  Your audience is still going to be there because they know you're real and you can do pretty
[03:52:02.160 --> 03:52:03.160]  much-
[03:52:03.160 --> 03:52:04.160]  I'm in a death battle.
[03:52:04.160 --> 03:52:05.160]  I'm ready for them to come after me.
[03:52:05.160 --> 03:52:06.160]  I don't even care.
[03:52:06.160 --> 03:52:07.160]  Exactly.
[03:52:07.160 --> 03:52:08.320]  Hey, something happens to me.
[03:52:08.320 --> 03:52:09.720]  This whole thing's happening.
[03:52:09.720 --> 03:52:13.840]  I'll just become more powerful long after I'm shoveled into my grave.
[03:52:13.840 --> 03:52:14.840]  I don't even care about me.
[03:52:14.840 --> 03:52:15.840]  It's not about ego.
[03:52:15.840 --> 03:52:17.800]  It's about fighting the tyranny.
[03:52:17.800 --> 03:52:18.960]  I win no matter what.
[03:52:18.960 --> 03:52:20.960]  It's just they don't even get- They don't understand it.
[03:52:20.960 --> 03:52:23.920]  They just- They're like they're blind, Anthony.
[03:52:23.920 --> 03:52:28.440]  They don't have the developed neurological systems, whatever you want to call it, spiritual,
[03:52:28.440 --> 03:52:32.800]  whatever, to understand a purpose greater than their own actions.
[03:52:32.800 --> 03:52:36.040]  So that when they're doing these things, they're conniving and attacking.
[03:52:36.040 --> 03:52:38.720]  They don't understand that you're not actually just conniving things.
[03:52:38.720 --> 03:52:41.920]  You're actually pushing a message that you care about more than yourself and more than
[03:52:41.920 --> 03:52:42.920]  yourself.
[03:52:42.920 --> 03:52:43.920]  Exactly.
[03:52:43.920 --> 03:52:44.920]  I'm committed to it.
[03:52:44.920 --> 03:52:46.360]  I sure I get hyped up to do it because it is.
[03:52:46.360 --> 03:52:47.520]  It takes some hoodspot.
[03:52:47.520 --> 03:52:49.520]  But I mean, at the end of the day, that's it.
[03:52:49.520 --> 03:52:52.800]  I mean, I know the world they're protecting is what's destroying us.
[03:52:52.800 --> 03:52:53.800]  Yes.
[03:52:53.800 --> 03:52:55.840]  And so all I can do is set my will against them.
[03:52:55.840 --> 03:52:57.520]  That's all they know, though.
[03:52:57.520 --> 03:53:03.000]  See, you're operating on this level of will and power, and that's how you do all this
[03:53:03.000 --> 03:53:04.760]  with, you know, even with no sleep.
[03:53:04.760 --> 03:53:05.760]  That's how anybody does it.
[03:53:05.760 --> 03:53:06.760]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:53:06.760 --> 03:53:07.760]  It's happened throughout history.
[03:53:07.760 --> 03:53:12.960]  It's just now you're standing on this precipice, on this peak amount where we're hitting into
[03:53:12.960 --> 03:53:16.440]  2016, which is going to be an insane year for everyone.
[03:53:16.440 --> 03:53:19.280]  And they're freaking out, saying, what are we going to do when we lose control?
[03:53:19.280 --> 03:53:20.280]  And that's the result.
[03:53:20.280 --> 03:53:23.120]  Well, they're also getting ready for the financial collapse, and I hope it doesn't come, but
[03:53:23.120 --> 03:53:24.120]  all the indicators are there.
[03:53:24.120 --> 03:53:27.480]  And there'll be troops rolling around the streets, and they're going to go, he hates
[03:53:27.480 --> 03:53:28.480]  the troops.
[03:53:28.480 --> 03:53:29.480]  I mean, you know, it's just, yeah.
[03:53:29.480 --> 03:53:30.480]  All right.
[03:53:30.480 --> 03:53:31.480]  Let's go to Alex.
[03:53:31.480 --> 03:53:32.480]  I really appreciate holding in this.
[03:53:32.480 --> 03:53:36.480]  Smith and others, your real trooper, Alex, you say your wife got visited by the TSA at
[03:53:36.480 --> 03:53:37.480]  work.
[03:53:37.480 --> 03:53:38.480]  Of course, that's in the news.
[03:53:38.480 --> 03:53:40.840]  I don't just believe the caller.
[03:53:40.840 --> 03:53:44.240]  It's infrastructure protection, but pretty soon it's down to the Walmarts.
[03:53:44.240 --> 03:53:45.240]  What happened?
[03:53:45.240 --> 03:53:51.000]  Well, Alex, pretty much, I was on my way back home, and my wife, she sent me a text and
[03:53:51.000 --> 03:53:56.960]  said that the TSA is here at work, and she works in the city, TSC, which is the traffic
[03:53:56.960 --> 03:53:57.960]  operation center.
[03:53:57.960 --> 03:54:01.520]  You know where they have like the video cameras everywhere, and they monitor traffic out.
[03:54:01.520 --> 03:54:03.520]  I know it'd be an infrastructure protection area.
[03:54:03.520 --> 03:54:04.520]  Yeah.
[03:54:04.520 --> 03:54:07.600]  The feds are taking over the infrastructure, but go ahead.
[03:54:07.600 --> 03:54:08.600]  Yeah.
[03:54:08.600 --> 03:54:13.720]  But anyway, she texted me, and she said that they've never had an inspection of TSAs there
[03:54:13.720 --> 03:54:17.400]  for like a random inspection, but the feds have never, ever been there.
[03:54:17.400 --> 03:54:22.480]  They randomly came in, and she said the reason was they're doing a security assessment of
[03:54:22.480 --> 03:54:29.520]  surface transportation, and I've, I know, I've looked into you for a while.
[03:54:29.520 --> 03:54:31.160]  And notice that's when the train just happened.
[03:54:31.160 --> 03:54:35.960]  They're claiming a projectile hit one, whether it was terror or not, get ready for more TSA.
[03:54:35.960 --> 03:54:40.000]  It's a real lot of everything, I mean, but that's a conspiracy theory to have known facts
[03:54:40.000 --> 03:54:41.000]  and then extrapolate.
[03:54:41.000 --> 03:54:43.320]  I mean, you might get laughed at by Fox News.
[03:54:43.320 --> 03:54:45.160]  You better not talk like this, Alex.
[03:54:45.160 --> 03:54:47.760]  They control reality, didn't you know?
[03:54:47.760 --> 03:54:51.520]  And don't say, don't use the word bossy, because that makes feminists mad.
[03:54:51.520 --> 03:54:52.840]  We better do what they say, too.
[03:54:52.840 --> 03:54:53.840]  How's that sound?
[03:54:53.840 --> 03:54:54.840]  Absolutely.
[03:54:54.840 --> 03:54:55.840]  I completely agree with you.
[03:54:55.840 --> 03:55:02.200]  I mean, isn't it just easier, Alex, just to submit and do what the smart people say,
[03:55:02.200 --> 03:55:05.360]  or tarts on TV might laugh at us?
[03:55:05.360 --> 03:55:07.520]  Oh, yeah, I know.
[03:55:07.520 --> 03:55:13.640]  It's like apparently my IQ is that's over like 100 does not really count for anything
[03:55:13.640 --> 03:55:14.640]  at all.
[03:55:14.640 --> 03:55:19.840]  Well, so the TSA, it's more about federalization.
[03:55:19.840 --> 03:55:24.480]  What are the feds doing showing up at your traffic relay system?
[03:55:24.480 --> 03:55:29.120]  They're showing up everywhere, but I was guessing I hadn't talked to you yet that it'd be infrastructure.
[03:55:29.120 --> 03:55:34.960]  It's power plants, it's road interchanges, it's construction companies, it's food processing,
[03:55:34.960 --> 03:55:40.280]  but they said in the C-SPAN briefing where they said everything they do in 2002, I watched
[03:55:40.280 --> 03:55:41.280]  it for two hours.
[03:55:41.280 --> 03:55:42.280]  That's why I'm an expert.
[03:55:42.280 --> 03:55:44.600]  So that's all them to say it.
[03:55:44.600 --> 03:55:49.000]  Every job will be approved through your national ID card, which is the driver's license, it's
[03:55:49.000 --> 03:55:50.000]  already standardized.
[03:55:50.000 --> 03:55:53.520]  To have a job, you'll have to go through TSA.
[03:55:53.520 --> 03:55:58.040]  And that's what InstaCheck is now to make sure you're a good person, you go in for an interview.
[03:55:58.040 --> 03:56:01.600]  They're getting you ready where everyone's going to get an interview.
[03:56:01.600 --> 03:56:06.760]  But sometimes in the line, you'll be taken away, they're still all going to be there.
[03:56:06.760 --> 03:56:11.000]  But that's how they do it, it's very loving.
[03:56:11.000 --> 03:56:12.000]  Anything else, Alex?
[03:56:12.000 --> 03:56:17.280]  No, but I trust them wholeheartedly, completely, because everything they do is for the good
[03:56:17.280 --> 03:56:18.800]  of me and my kids.
[03:56:18.800 --> 03:56:20.080]  Good, that's more like it.
[03:56:20.080 --> 03:56:21.680]  Let's take another evil person's call.
[03:56:21.680 --> 03:56:23.360]  Let's talk to Sean in California.
[03:56:23.360 --> 03:56:25.720]  And then, Smith, I've got to go quick here.
[03:56:25.720 --> 03:56:26.720]  Go ahead, Sean.
[03:56:26.720 --> 03:56:34.800]  Hey, I got two things, the first is I'm just so, so thankful that I found Dr. Wall through
[03:56:34.800 --> 03:56:35.800]  your show.
[03:56:35.800 --> 03:56:38.440]  It's changed my life.
[03:56:38.440 --> 03:56:42.200]  Everybody needs to get out and get the book Epigenetics.
[03:56:42.200 --> 03:56:45.600]  Everybody needs to check out Dr. Wall and Dr. Glidden.
[03:56:45.600 --> 03:56:49.080]  We have to go, you know, against the medical, you know.
[03:56:49.080 --> 03:56:52.560]  No, no, the government loves us.
[03:56:52.560 --> 03:56:55.360]  Force inoculation is never coming, but now it's here.
[03:56:55.360 --> 03:56:59.960]  Let's take all the shots and have a convulsion or let your baby die with the shots.
[03:56:59.960 --> 03:57:00.960]  Oh, it's beautiful.
[03:57:00.960 --> 03:57:02.960]  Oh, I love the government.
[03:57:02.960 --> 03:57:03.960]  Oh, loving.
[03:57:03.960 --> 03:57:06.840]  Inject the black people with syphilis.
[03:57:06.840 --> 03:57:07.840]  Trust the government.
[03:57:07.840 --> 03:57:08.840]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[03:57:08.840 --> 03:57:12.720]  I was just having a dream of tyranny, take me away instead of a bubble bath.
[03:57:12.720 --> 03:57:13.720]  Tyranny, take me away.
[03:57:13.720 --> 03:57:15.920]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[03:57:15.920 --> 03:57:21.800]  We have to get back to basics and get the nutrients we need, like Wallach said, everybody, everybody
[03:57:21.800 --> 03:57:27.760]  listening right now, if you haven't got the book or what you got to check it is it's revolutionary.
[03:57:27.760 --> 03:57:28.760]  I'm going to jump.
[03:57:28.760 --> 03:57:29.760]  God bless you.
[03:57:29.760 --> 03:57:30.760]  I just got to jam in a few more.
[03:57:30.760 --> 03:57:31.760]  Smith in Virginia.
[03:57:31.760 --> 03:57:32.760]  You're going to be our tailgunner.
[03:57:32.760 --> 03:57:33.760]  Sorry to the others.
[03:57:33.760 --> 03:57:34.760]  Smith from Virginia.
[03:57:34.760 --> 03:57:35.760]  We salute you.
[03:57:35.760 --> 03:57:36.760]  Go ahead.
[03:57:36.760 --> 03:57:37.760]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:57:37.760 --> 03:57:42.520]  I appreciate you taking the call and I hope this goes out and that the people that can
[03:57:42.520 --> 03:57:44.640]  hear do hear it.
[03:57:44.640 --> 03:57:48.640]  Jade Helm, Jade and Jade Helm stands for Jadeite.
[03:57:48.640 --> 03:57:49.640]  It's a mineral.
[03:57:49.640 --> 03:57:53.240]  Hopefully, everybody will look into this helmet.
[03:57:53.240 --> 03:57:59.080]  They've been tracking for about eight months, a two and a half mile wide asteroid that's
[03:57:59.080 --> 03:58:04.720]  going to hit off the coast of South America between September the 15th and the 28th, what
[03:58:04.720 --> 03:58:07.680]  they think, but they've moved troops into that area.
[03:58:07.680 --> 03:58:11.520]  Well, I got to jump, but I'll look into that.
[03:58:11.520 --> 03:58:14.320]  Now they'll say that I said that on the news, but who knows?
[03:58:14.320 --> 03:58:17.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, I know a big asteroid is passing by today, just like something
[03:58:17.720 --> 03:58:20.080]  like 400 miles or something.
[03:58:20.080 --> 03:58:23.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, we take you now live to Planet Klandathu, where our brave forces
[03:58:23.680 --> 03:58:26.440]  are battling led by General Hillary Clinton.
[03:58:26.440 --> 03:58:28.120]  It's a starship troopers joke.
[03:58:28.120 --> 03:58:29.120]  Would you like to know more?
[03:58:29.120 --> 03:58:30.120]  Good job, Tony.
[03:58:30.120 --> 03:58:31.120]  All right, that's it.
[03:58:31.120 --> 03:58:48.160]  Up, up and away.
