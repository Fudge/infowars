[00:00.000 --> 00:24.000]  Now you're standing here sometimes, you've been through many years somewhere, I can't
[00:24.000 --> 00:36.000]  hide what you have to hide, and tell me what you have to tell.
[00:36.000 --> 00:44.000]  This policy, Bill Gates's policy of truth being honest over the last 40 years that he
[00:44.000 --> 00:49.000]  wants power over the world government to depopulate you and your family even until the Wall Street
[00:49.000 --> 00:56.000]  Journal that and the New York Times and the London Guardian that in 2009 when he made a
[00:56.000 --> 00:59.000]  little special tour about it all.
[00:59.000 --> 01:06.000]  And so now his policy of truth is causing him a really, really big problem because folks
[01:06.000 --> 01:11.000]  understand what's really happening and they're facing the full horror because criminals like
[01:11.000 --> 01:13.000]  Bill Gates like to brag.
[01:13.000 --> 01:18.000]  Again, thank you so much for joining us on this live October 3rd Sunday Transmission on
[01:18.000 --> 01:19.000]  Sunday Transmission.
[01:19.000 --> 01:24.000]  I'll be here for the next two hours and then Harris Smith is coming in to host Sunday Live,
[01:24.000 --> 01:27.000]  two hours of live radio slash TV.
[01:27.000 --> 01:32.000]  It only has six minutes of ads an hour and so the customary 14 like syndicated radio
[01:32.000 --> 01:35.000]  and TV do when they are in this format.
[01:35.000 --> 01:42.000]  Again, I'm going to try to be as calm as I can here today but we really should all just
[01:42.000 --> 01:50.000]  sit back for a moment and take a deep breath and cogitate or meditate or just think very
[01:50.000 --> 02:01.000]  deeply and very calmly and very serenely so it will soak in at a cerebral level and then
[02:01.000 --> 02:06.000]  we have to make decisions at a cerebral level and then emotionally once we've made our
[02:06.000 --> 02:12.000]  decisions in a very calm way use the emotions the good Lord gave us to very aggressively
[02:12.000 --> 02:17.000]  power our intellect against the globalist.
[02:17.000 --> 02:23.000]  You can intellectually decide that you're going to do something like unscrew a despot's
[02:23.000 --> 02:30.000]  head but then if you're going to do it physically it takes the horse power psychologically, mentally
[02:30.000 --> 02:36.000]  and physically to actually break that neck quickly and easily.
[02:36.000 --> 02:40.000]  I just use that as historical metaphor.
[02:40.000 --> 02:45.000]  So here we are ladies and gentlemen I think we should all take stake of how many people the
[02:45.000 --> 02:50.000]  globalists have already killed and how many people they're going to kill and how many are
[02:50.000 --> 02:53.000]  already walking dead.
[02:53.000 --> 02:59.000]  People ask me how do you take it all the attacks on the news all the lies unprecedented judge
[02:59.000 --> 03:05.000]  in Texas saying you don't get a jury trial I'm just going to shut down info wars in violation
[03:05.000 --> 03:07.000]  of the Seventh Amendment.
[03:07.000 --> 03:12.000]  People ask themselves how are you taking that and that isn't even on the Richter scale.
[03:12.000 --> 03:18.000]  With the devastation and the death and the pain and the suffering and the economic crises
[03:18.000 --> 03:24.000]  the dollar devaluation the global currency devaluations we're seeing the short supply
[03:24.000 --> 03:30.000]  of staple goods and of energy around the world.
[03:30.000 --> 03:35.000]  I'm not just telling you what's coming now that happens next week I told you years ago
[03:35.000 --> 03:43.000]  what was going to happen I told you 20 months ago in early February what we'd be seeing
[03:43.000 --> 03:47.000]  by the fall and winter of 2021 and it's here.
[03:47.000 --> 03:52.000]  So I don't take any pleasure in that I've got the globalist battle plan here and people are finally
[03:52.000 --> 03:57.000]  figuring out whether it's Glenn Beck or whether it's Steven Crowder or whether it's Joe Rogan
[03:57.000 --> 04:02.000]  or whether it's Tucker Carlson or whether it's anybody else that's against you know this corrupt
[04:02.000 --> 04:08.000]  leftist movement but the left is only the foot soldiers of a scientific corporate elite that
[04:08.000 --> 04:13.000]  are taking over the whole planet and preparing to bankrupt the world currencies on its ashes
[04:13.000 --> 04:18.000]  bring in their global carbon tax and their global reset.
[04:18.000 --> 04:24.000]  And so it's a good thing that the intellectual resistance to the leftist movement is awake now
[04:24.000 --> 04:29.000]  but can we wake Congress up can we wake the governor's up because if we don't move against this
[04:29.000 --> 04:35.000]  we're going to go through hellish pain already it's going to be stratosphericly bad.
[04:35.000 --> 04:41.000]  So I'm ready to deal with this I'm not happy about it but I've got my soul lined up with God
[04:41.000 --> 04:47.000]  and I can deal with it when the general public feels figures out and feels the pain
[04:47.000 --> 04:52.000]  but when they figure out how much trouble they're in it's going to be explosive and it's going to be hellish
[04:52.000 --> 04:56.000]  and it's going to be dangerous that's exactly what Klaus Schwab has been playing the whole time
[04:56.000 --> 05:03.000]  only full awakening to it and getting right with God can save us.
[05:03.000 --> 05:09.000]  My business model is very very simple I want to bring you products that work really really well
[05:09.000 --> 05:14.000]  at affordable prices that are competitive so that you'll shop with us and so we form a relationship
[05:14.000 --> 05:20.000]  so we're able to stay on air and fight the globalist and have good products that make us healthy
[05:20.000 --> 05:24.000]  make us wiser that boost our immune system and that's what we've done.
[05:24.000 --> 05:28.000]  Now one area of the immune system we don't talk enough about is deep restful sleep
[05:28.000 --> 05:32.000]  look it up for yourself the effects of deep restful sleep on health and the immune system
[05:32.000 --> 05:36.000]  and so with everything we're doing out there to boost our immune system with vitamin D
[05:36.000 --> 05:41.000]  and zinc and all of it that's great but deep restful sleep is just as important maybe more important
[05:41.000 --> 05:47.000]  so infowarstore.com now can announce 50% off on our best-selling product down and out
[05:47.000 --> 05:52.000]  that just came back in after four months being sold out it's 50% off it's super strong

[05:57.000 --> 06:15.000]  5 stars infowarstore.com down and out now back in stock 50% off
[06:15.000 --> 06:24.000]  From the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones
[06:24.000 --> 06:29.000]  Well I want everybody to brace yourselves and I really want everybody to then let this show
[06:29.000 --> 06:34.000]  kid and decide what you're going to do about it but we have Mike Adams who's a great engineer
[06:34.000 --> 06:42.000]  and a very smart man joining us to break down a lawyer who's prominent who just pointed out
[06:42.000 --> 06:48.000]  and put a story out that's gone viral then Mike Adams expanded on it with the Pentagon's
[06:48.000 --> 06:55.000]  AI main AI project that was monitoring COVID-19 worldwide but particularly in the U.S.
[06:55.000 --> 07:05.000]  that was launched last April and its findings and the findings are very conclusive that
[07:05.000 --> 07:11.000]  the individuals that have taken the mRNA injections that they call vaccines Pfizer and Moderna
[07:11.000 --> 07:19.000]  are having their immune systems erased within five to six months and then are developing
[07:19.000 --> 07:26.000]  ADE and ADE something you don't want because if you come in contact with any other type
[07:26.000 --> 07:34.000]  of cold virus you have a violent cytokine storm and generally die and when they see this
[07:34.000 --> 07:39.000]  happen they're claiming it's COVID killing you and they're blaming the unvaccinated but
[07:39.000 --> 07:44.000]  it's all in the Pentagon report we've got the slideshow from the Pentagon and Mike Adams
[07:44.000 --> 07:51.000]  joins us coming up in T minus 24 minutes to go over that. We also have a lot of huge
[07:51.000 --> 08:00.000]  news on the economy and the so-called spending budget that is almost $4 trillion that gives
[08:00.000 --> 08:05.000]  hundreds of billions of dollars to Democrat operatives on the streets to steal elections
[08:05.000 --> 08:10.000]  and basically sow racial division we've got all that but it's okay House Budget Committee
[08:10.000 --> 08:15.000]  Chairman says the federal government can quote afford anything and that money is unlimited
[08:15.000 --> 08:20.000]  it's a real video a real quote and we're going to talk about what that really means it means
[08:20.000 --> 08:25.000]  food shortages it means collapse of civilizations it means Venezuela when they start telling
[08:25.000 --> 08:33.000]  you in Weimar Germany in the 1920s or they start telling you in the 1990s in Zimbabwe
[08:33.000 --> 08:42.000]  Africa or they start telling you in the 2000s in places in South America like Venezuela
[08:42.000 --> 08:46.000]  that they got plenty of money and that money is unlimited the government could quote do
[08:46.000 --> 08:51.000]  anything Katie bar the door you're going to see what's already happening food prices
[08:51.000 --> 08:56.000]  exploding commodity prices exploding long lines really bad in Europe really bad in
[08:56.000 --> 09:01.000]  Australia really bad in the UK and they're now saying food shortages throughout Christmas
[09:01.000 --> 09:08.000]  and basically no Christmas and CNN blames America in the headline how America ruined Christmas
[09:08.000 --> 09:13.000]  if we would have just all taken our shots our third and fourth shots we would have all
[09:13.000 --> 09:18.000]  saved the world everything's our fault aren't they nice folks over at CNN I thought it was
[09:18.000 --> 09:23.000]  Klaus Schwab and the great reset that's that's all coming up and the crew makes a good point
[09:23.000 --> 09:27.000]  they put up an article from last year in the New York Times oh instead of coronavirus
[09:27.000 --> 09:33.000]  the hunger will kill us as global food crisis lives back then they said 287 million people
[09:33.000 --> 09:38.000]  went to the verge of starvation extra 20 plus million did die new numbers are out looks like
[09:38.000 --> 09:43.000]  another 40 million extra old I this year so that's 60 million people Klaus Schwab killed
[09:43.000 --> 09:49.000]  with the lockdowns and the people wearing masks and saying they were heroes and staying in
[09:49.000 --> 09:56.000]  because when the first world shuts down the third world dies they died and then those
[09:56.000 --> 10:03.000]  that live flood us and flood over our borders and we've got it's now 80,000 documented coming
[10:03.000 --> 10:07.000]  towards the border another 10,000 or so were a few days are coming across just from Haiti
[10:07.000 --> 10:15.000]  but an 80,000 just broke through Thursday across the Guatemala border UN directed 80,000 the
[10:15.000 --> 10:23.000]  Mexican government confirms 80,000 marching and taking UN buses up to the Texas border
[10:23.000 --> 10:30.000]  rather than broken up and same number again 80% not getting pulled up 80 so much in 80,000
[10:30.000 --> 10:35.000]  80% 80,000 are now coming and of the 40,000 or so that already got here in the last month
[10:35.000 --> 10:43.000]  80% you can look it up by administration releases 80% of the 80,000 so you do the math
[10:43.000 --> 10:49.000]  that's more than 60,000 right there for you so simply incredible right now let's just
[10:49.000 --> 10:55.000]  dive into the COVID worldwide police state news representative Adam Schiff says YouTube
[10:55.000 --> 11:01.000]  ban on vaccine skepticism doesn't go far enough any criticism and including local news or
[11:01.000 --> 11:06.000]  even doctors showing you the inserts of regular vaccines and the side effects you're not
[11:06.000 --> 11:11.000]  allowed as a consumer or a doctor to have consumer reports all of its band this is what
[11:11.000 --> 11:16.000]  Facebook said two years ago about me they said no positive Alex Jones only negative
[11:16.000 --> 11:23.000]  that was an actual statement same thing here only positive stuff about vaccines all vaccines
[11:23.000 --> 11:28.000]  not just this mRNA gene therapy but real vaccines like measles mumps rubella experimental
[11:28.000 --> 11:32.000]  vaccines that are killing people for HIV you name it for Ebola you are not to post
[11:32.000 --> 11:35.000]  an article about it or talk about it it's so good for you know they've been a good
[11:35.000 --> 11:41.000]  kill you continuing Twitter censors obituary of COVID vaccine victim the doctors
[11:41.000 --> 11:46.000]  confirmed she died of a heart attack young woman young mother what 30 years old when
[11:46.000 --> 11:50.000]  she took the shot and they just said that's not allowed so you know read the
[11:50.000 --> 11:54.000]  screenshots of them being restricted and blocked for yourself but she's dead now
[11:54.000 --> 11:58.000]  heart attack it says on the insert up until a few months ago there was nothing on the
[11:58.000 --> 12:02.000]  inserts remember but now it says oh my car died us and a bunch of other forms of heart
[12:02.000 --> 12:06.000]  attacks well here's another one for him Denver police officer and father of four
[12:06.000 --> 12:11.000]  takes the jab and now cannot walk but that's okay you know it's for the greater
[12:11.000 --> 12:16.000]  good right Newsome unleashes mass culling of America's children California Governor
[12:16.000 --> 12:20.000]  Gavin Newsome has done the unthinkable ignore the research ignore the deaths
[12:20.000 --> 12:25.000]  ignore the doctors and parents that will rise up like a firestorm the next few
[12:25.000 --> 12:30.000]  days weeks and months as he moves against the children that's to give vaccine liability
[12:30.000 --> 12:35.000]  protection this person was experimental now that's expiring so they lied say oh it's
[12:35.000 --> 12:40.000]  approved when it's not they've approved the official vaccine in 2025 it's all
[12:40.000 --> 12:44.000]  side of hand but by him mandating it for children at a state level it kicks in
[12:44.000 --> 12:48.000]  emergency authorization Rick Perry did something really bad and Rick Perry is
[12:48.000 --> 12:51.000]  better than these guys but when he approved the Gardasil experimental shot
[12:51.000 --> 12:56.000]  14 years ago that it killed people in other countries live virus vaccine and then
[12:56.000 --> 13:02.000]  when he recommended it made it quote sanctioned but it wasn't forced but it was
[13:02.000 --> 13:05.000]  on the list of what they want you to take to go to school they try to lie and say
[13:05.000 --> 13:09.000]  you have to but that didn't give liability protection to the drug in the
[13:09.000 --> 13:13.000]  United States and it caused a lot of deaths and problems and now you don't see
[13:13.000 --> 13:19.000]  him pushing Gardasil shots do you continuing though video health care
[13:19.000 --> 13:23.000]  workers burned scrubs in protest of New York vaccine mandate out in the streets
[13:23.000 --> 13:28.000]  by the thousands you don't listen to nurses and doctors that have seen nine
[13:28.000 --> 13:32.000]  ten months of the vaccine killing people here in the US and maiming them no no
[13:32.000 --> 13:38.000]  they were the heroes before right but now they're not and Brazil's Bolsonaro is
[13:38.000 --> 13:43.000]  what I wish Trump would have been Brazil's Bolsonaro unchained if you accept
[13:43.000 --> 13:48.000]  this vaccination passport it will lead to population control and eugenics that
[13:48.000 --> 13:54.000]  story up on info wars dot com news wars dot com also national file dot com and
[13:54.000 --> 13:59.000]  Fauci says unvaccinated should not be able to work or go to school in a new
[13:59.000 --> 14:05.000]  statement on face the nation where have I heard of that before oh here's the
[14:05.000 --> 14:13.000]  AP Israel Titans COVID green pass rules sparking protest oh look at this they
[14:13.000 --> 14:17.000]  took the first two shots now Israel has the highest rates of deaths and illnesses
[14:17.000 --> 14:23.000]  in the world over 90% injected vaccinated and now booster jab every six months
[14:23.000 --> 14:29.000]  1.5 million double dose and recovered Israelis people that actually got sick
[14:29.000 --> 14:34.000]  from the shots lose green pass privileges as stricter COVID-19 rules
[14:34.000 --> 14:39.000]  kick in oh stricter rules that you'll put in your body what we say when we say
[14:39.000 --> 14:45.000]  of experimental injections or now you can't go outside and if you compare
[14:45.000 --> 14:49.000]  Israel to Sweden or Palestine or anywhere that's much lower vaccine rates
[14:49.000 --> 14:54.000]  they have the highest rate in the world compared to other places like them
[14:54.000 --> 14:58.000]  you know large countries that do not have high vaccination rates they have very
[14:58.000 --> 15:02.000]  low illness rates here's some of the numbers from Israel you can see Sweden
[15:02.000 --> 15:09.000]  compared they've got one tenth the cases and illnesses that Israel has and
[15:09.000 --> 15:12.000]  they're protesting all over Europe freedom without certificates thousands
[15:12.000 --> 15:16.000]  protest against COVID passports and planned vaccine mandates in Romania
[15:16.000 --> 15:21.000]  that's all up on info wars.com very very important but oh SNL in Hollywood
[15:21.000 --> 15:26.000]  looking down its nose at us does a skit making fun of parents protesting
[15:26.000 --> 15:30.000]  forced injections for their children to go to school and the fact that it's
[15:30.000 --> 15:34.000]  color of law and you don't have to they're trying to make it actually a law
[15:34.000 --> 15:38.000]  on a mandate but nope but nobody's passed the law yet it's all just bureaucracies
[15:38.000 --> 15:42.000]  and media and the executive branch and drug companies ordering you what to do
[15:42.000 --> 15:46.000]  and a bunch of Hollywood trash making fun of you we're not gonna assure you
[15:46.000 --> 15:50.000]  Hollywood's exempt and so is Congress and so is the CDC look it up
[15:50.000 --> 15:56.000]  they're exempt but you're not you're a slave it's all coming up on the other side
[15:56.000 --> 15:59.000]  stay with us
[16:01.000 --> 16:06.000]  if you think the tyranny and oppression we're living under now is bad wait till
[16:06.000 --> 16:11.000]  they've got their world ID hand and that's exactly what the COVID passports are
[16:11.000 --> 16:16.000]  all about and Klaus Schwab and the UN and all the other globalist leaders own
[16:16.000 --> 16:21.000]  words they admit that once they've got you with that system then they're gonna
[16:21.000 --> 16:26.000]  carbon tax you everywhere you go and track what you do and publicly they're
[16:26.000 --> 16:30.000]  saying they're gonna decide when you can travel and when you can't travel and
[16:30.000 --> 16:34.000]  MasterCard and then all the other big companies are currently announcing
[16:34.000 --> 16:38.000]  they're gonna track what you do and where you go and tax you with a carbon
[16:38.000 --> 16:43.000]  tax for it this is the holy grail of tyranny ladies and gentlemen this is
[16:43.000 --> 16:47.000]  the takeover in humanity better wake up and say no finally folks are starting
[16:47.000 --> 16:50.000]  to wake up Joe Rogan Tucker Carlson others leave the charge along with
[16:50.000 --> 16:55.000]  implores but it's not enough every individual has to not comply we have
[16:55.000 --> 16:59.000]  to talk about bringing the globalist to justice you see they need the fear of God
[16:59.000 --> 17:04.000]  put in them legally and lawfully it is through our five senses that we are
[17:04.000 --> 17:09.000]  kept fascinated and hypnotized by the lies we are told and the only way to see
[17:09.000 --> 17:14.000]  through this illusion is with our higher senses which is why fluoridated water is
[17:14.000 --> 17:19.000]  a big problem consuming too much fluoride forms phosphate crystals around the
[17:19.000 --> 17:24.000]  pineal gland and shuts down its natural functions natural functions which have
[17:24.000 --> 17:28.000]  been known for millennia the Hindu chakras align with the endocrine system
[17:28.000 --> 17:33.000]  the chakra aligned with the pineal gland is the third eye also described as the
[17:33.000 --> 17:37.000]  seat of the soul the pineal gland is what connects us to higher levels of
[17:37.000 --> 17:42.000]  consciousness and otherwise unseen dimensions of reality fluoride free
[17:42.000 --> 17:48.000]  water is essential to keeping our pineal gland healthy our water filtration
[17:48.000 --> 17:53.000]  systems with the proper filters will keep your drinking water fluoride free and
[17:53.000 --> 17:58.000]  the propure shower head will seal the deal get them both today for yourself or
[17:58.000 --> 18:05.000]  a friend at infowarstore.com and in addition we were really finding that we
[18:05.000 --> 18:09.000]  were stressing the cardiopulmonary systems of these employees because when you
[18:09.000 --> 18:13.000]  cover the mouth and nose and you exert physical energy during your work during
[18:13.000 --> 18:17.000]  your tasks whatever it might be you're really stressing the cardiopulmonary
[18:17.000 --> 18:21.000]  system because you change the way that you breathe you have to forcibly inhale
[18:21.000 --> 18:26.000]  and forcibly exhale that taxes the heart it taxes the lungs and we have given
[18:26.000 --> 18:31.000]  people heart attacks by allowing them to work with their mouth and nose covered
[18:31.000 --> 18:37.000]  with absolutely no regulation no oversight no medical oversight the
[18:37.000 --> 18:40.000]  globalists have told us we're a disease they've told us they want to eradicate
[18:40.000 --> 18:44.000]  us and all the studies show that when you wear these masks it lowers your
[18:44.000 --> 18:49.000]  oxygen level up to one-third and gives you dangerous levels of carbon dioxide
[18:49.000 --> 18:53.000]  poisoning this is a sick cult and we've got to say no but the only way the real
[18:53.000 --> 18:58.000]  science comes out of the public is if we tell them get your copy today of

[20:38.000 --> 20:43.000]  everybody else about the broadcast that lives at freeworldnews.tv
[20:43.000 --> 20:49.000]  info wars.com forward slash show so I just read you a lot of really important news
[20:49.000 --> 20:55.000]  the coming up next segment we're going to show you the Pentagon documents and the
[20:55.000 --> 21:01.000]  Pentagon report and the Pentagon PowerPoint published by the Pentagon and
[21:01.000 --> 21:07.000]  a lead lawyer Thomas Renz who is currently lead counsel in three of the major
[21:07.000 --> 21:13.000]  big national lawsuits is filing this is his evidence and it it's very clear I've
[21:13.000 --> 21:17.000]  shown it to medical doctors I've shown it to statisticians and it's all right
[21:17.000 --> 21:22.000]  there it's all in what the Pentagon released with their big COVID AI
[21:22.000 --> 21:28.000]  analysis program and it's also what we see in the October report by the CDC
[21:28.000 --> 21:32.000]  before they even approved the vaccine they'd already done some secretive
[21:32.000 --> 21:36.000]  trials in the UK and it was causing heart attacks and they said this will
[21:36.000 --> 21:40.000]  probably cause microcarditis heart swelling and also straight-up heart attacks
[21:40.000 --> 21:45.000]  so that's going on and so when you have a heart attack and die whether you're
[21:45.000 --> 21:50.000]  12 years old or whether you were you know Hank Aaron and we're 80 years old
[21:50.000 --> 21:55.000]  or whatever 79 years old they just try to suppress that fact so that's what's
[21:55.000 --> 21:59.000]  coming out and yeah this came out months ago but now even more information
[21:59.000 --> 22:05.000]  has come out 50,000 patients died soon after within 14 days after getting
[22:05.000 --> 22:09.000]  COVID-19 vaccines as whistleblower that's why the CDC does account somebody who
[22:09.000 --> 22:14.000]  dies from the COVID-19 vaccines Pfizer and Moderna in the first 14 days they
[22:14.000 --> 22:18.000]  counted as unvaccinated but that's during the period that if it's going to kill
[22:18.000 --> 22:21.000]  you quick it's going to kill you so if you're a radio listener understand
[22:21.000 --> 22:25.000]  everything I'm saying we're putting on screen don't believe a word I say go
[22:25.000 --> 22:28.000]  check it out for yourself that's why the system is constantly trying to
[22:28.000 --> 22:32.000]  demonize this and constantly trying to shut us down and and it's gotten rid of
[22:32.000 --> 22:38.000]  my due process it is because they they are dismantling this country with this
[22:38.000 --> 22:42.000]  country is in a war for its survival and if Congress and others don't fully
[22:42.000 --> 22:47.000]  wake up to it it's over I can tell you that I've talked to basically all the
[22:47.000 --> 22:52.000]  top talk show hosts in the country I mean all the top ones the top five I talked
[22:52.000 --> 22:55.000]  to and they're all totally awake now they've all checked it all up they know
[22:55.000 --> 22:59.000]  it's all true doing as much as they can to bring this out but if the
[22:59.000 --> 23:03.000]  governors and the people in the legislatures and the Republican leadership
[23:03.000 --> 23:07.000]  don't get hardcore I don't know what we're going to do we're going to have to
[23:07.000 --> 23:13.000]  start doing civil disobedience and things just to bring this out so much
[23:13.000 --> 23:17.000]  that it forces it out because we're under UN global corporate attack that's
[23:17.000 --> 23:21.000]  what the great reset is and and the Congress and the FBI is all prepared
[23:21.000 --> 23:26.000]  for a foreign state enemy when the main state is Facebook and Twitter and
[23:26.000 --> 23:31.000]  Google and the chai comms and all these big consortiums of power and take
[23:31.000 --> 23:35.000]  big pharma the central banks are the most powerful they're the private
[23:35.000 --> 23:40.000]  shareholders of the European US Australian New Zealand canadian banks
[23:40.000 --> 23:44.000]  they issue the currency and credit the federal government doesn't and they
[23:44.000 --> 23:49.000]  own big pharma that's the second largest combine and then it's defense and then
[23:49.000 --> 23:54.000]  it's a media and and so on and former Australian member of parliament says
[23:54.000 --> 23:59.000]  Pfizer and AstraZeneca paid lobbyists to direct Australia's leaders to push
[23:59.000 --> 24:04.000]  vaccine mandates video well I don't need him to tell me that it's true they've
[24:04.000 --> 24:08.000]  spent billions in the US in the last decade buying up the politicians
[24:08.000 --> 24:11.000]  billions in Europe and hundreds of millions in Australia and that's why
[24:11.000 --> 24:15.000]  when Pfizer CEO came on TV a month ago and he said I don't care if the two
[24:15.000 --> 24:20.000]  top scientists quit at the FDA over these shots we're going to have boasters
[24:20.000 --> 24:26.000]  and three weeks later they did I don't care what the scientists on the CDC
[24:26.000 --> 24:31.000]  and FDA board say even if it's in law that we follow they say it's going to
[24:31.000 --> 24:36.000]  happen and Fauci says it's going to happen to it it is because they are
[24:36.000 --> 24:40.000]  bought and paid for and the Justice Department won't indict him so that's
[24:40.000 --> 24:45.000]  where we are we're literally in the hands of a big pharma cartel that's merged
[24:45.000 --> 24:49.000]  with big tech big tech is heavily invested in all this and that's why
[24:49.000 --> 24:52.000]  YouTube all of them come out and said there will be no criticism of any
[24:52.000 --> 24:55.000]  vaccine and now there are hell maybe if a drug makes you have a heart attack
[24:55.000 --> 25:01.000]  you can't talk about it already happens with the shots so you can find that
[25:01.000 --> 25:04.000]  video at infowars.com it's also on gatewaypunna.com a former Australian
[25:04.000 --> 25:08.000]  member of parliament came out and said Pfizer and AstraZeneca are paying
[25:08.000 --> 25:12.000]  lobbyists direct Australia's leaders to push vaccine mandates Clive Palmer
[25:12.000 --> 25:18.000]  leader of the United Australia Party claimed outside New South Wales premiere
[25:18.000 --> 25:23.000]  was told she would be charged with the corruption probe if she imposed a
[25:23.000 --> 25:26.000]  vaccine mandate and it turns out that that's what the new South Wales lady
[25:26.000 --> 25:30.000]  stepped down was she was openly getting reportedly over a million dollars
[25:30.000 --> 25:35.000]  herself from big pharma to do this and we're not just talking about for
[25:35.000 --> 25:39.000]  campaign money folks we mean paid that's how you get a lockstep operation I
[25:39.000 --> 25:44.000]  mean what is Bill Gates done for 30 years it's mainstream news he spent
[25:44.000 --> 25:49.000]  over a hundred billion dollars of tax exempt money and government money he
[25:49.000 --> 25:54.000]  got just like Soros doesn't spend his own money Soros gets state department
[25:54.000 --> 25:59.000]  money to run his refugee operations well well Gates got Ford and Carnegie
[25:59.000 --> 26:03.000]  and Rockefeller Foundation money and all his money tax exempt than a bunch
[26:03.000 --> 26:09.000]  of taxpayer money to then go out and buy up all of the major health
[26:09.000 --> 26:12.000]  departments and national health institutes around the world he got kicked
[26:12.000 --> 26:16.000]  out of more than 30 countries including India for running illegal secret
[26:16.000 --> 26:22.000]  vaccine testing that killed people look this up and now they just bum rush
[26:22.000 --> 26:25.000]  everybody with the COVID fear into doing this I think they've committed a crime
[26:25.000 --> 26:28.000]  so big we'll never wake up to it
[26:28.000 --> 26:32.000]  Wayne Root very smart talk show host big article on Gateway Punnett says it's
[26:32.000 --> 26:36.000]  time for civil disobedience here's how we stop Biden vaccine mandates and I
[26:36.000 --> 26:39.000]  agree with this article in fact I want to tell the crew post that article or

[27:12.000 --> 27:18.000]  going to be this battle plan for peaceful civil disobedience now we're going to
[27:18.000 --> 27:22.000]  come back and hit the COVID news that's the biggest ever I mean this is the
[27:22.000 --> 27:26.000]  Pentagon confirming but all the top scientists have been screaming and let
[27:26.000 --> 27:29.000]  that sink in it's not theoretical that if you take these shots it's going to
[27:29.000 --> 27:33.000]  cause this syndrome where your body then attacks itself and it's fatal a large
[27:33.000 --> 27:38.000]  portion of the time around half the time because you just keep getting sick having
[27:38.000 --> 27:43.000]  autoimmune responses that are extremely violent like the 1917 Spanish flu was
[27:43.000 --> 27:49.000]  similar a natural occurrence of this where you've been exposed to a virus but
[27:49.000 --> 27:52.000]  then the next time you're exposed to a similar virus you just have a huge
[27:52.000 --> 27:56.000]  autoimmune response in your lungs filled with water and you swell up it's like
[27:56.000 --> 28:00.000]  once you've been stung by a bee and then you have a overreaction to be so this
[28:00.000 --> 28:03.000]  is just unbelievable it's what happened in rats and similar studies we covered
[28:03.000 --> 28:09.000]  at nauseam so that's coming up and then Democrats have been caught in giant
[28:09.000 --> 28:17.000]  false flag attacks giant stage stories giant hoaxes we're not supposed to
[28:17.000 --> 28:21.000]  question big events but a lot of the time they're totally staged so I've got
[28:21.000 --> 28:25.000]  two big ones after Mike Adams leaves us including Roe v. Wade did you know it's
[28:25.000 --> 28:28.000]  now admitted they've they've released the documents they've gone public
[28:28.000 --> 28:33.000]  including the woman that filed Roe v. Wade and it turns out it was all fake she
[28:33.000 --> 28:38.000]  was not raped she did not abort a baby illegally and the baby is now 50 years
[28:38.000 --> 28:43.000]  old and has gone public but that's only part of the false flags by Democrats
[28:43.000 --> 28:47.000]  black woman masquerading is KKK clan member terrorized neighbors and finally
[28:47.000 --> 28:52.000]  got caught by the cops in the act that's all coming up so just every day we've
[28:52.000 --> 28:55.000]  got new false flag news for you on the left they don't need to question them

[33:55.000 --> 34:11.000]  and we are we are seeing the elites of the planet if you use that term for them in open war against civilization bouts he says you can't go visit your family this Christmas because of covid that he cooked up in a lab
[34:11.000 --> 34:27.000]  but hollywood doesn't have to wear their mask at their big galas and when they see biden on 9 11 with hundreds of other bureaucrats behind the stage they weren't wearing masks only put them on for public consumption it's all a fraud while they block the real vitamins and
[34:27.000 --> 34:43.000]  minerals and drugs that they know would protect you mike adams joins us see the great job reporting a story that broke thursday evening a lot of different angles to it even with the angle of a i powered do d data analysis program named project solace shatters official
[34:43.000 --> 34:57.000]  vaccine narrative shows ade accelerating in the fully vaccinated with each passing week and there's other angles to it but ade is the big one and again for people that saw this and didn't follow the links
[34:57.000 --> 35:15.000]  I have a whole stack of articles here that I'll show TV viewers first this is from mainstream news this from the pentagon's own site effectiveness of m r and a covid 19 vaccines against the delta variant amongst 5.6 million Medicare beneficiaries 65 years and older this is a particular study
[35:15.000 --> 35:31.000]  in September 28 2021 it got discovered by a lawyer that's involved in his lawsuits against him and it's now come out so this is put out by the pentagon here's articles about it from mainstream news pentagon ai tool for battling coronavirus holds lessons for war that's

[35:55.000 --> 36:03.000]  now suddenly they're quiet about project solace because of what it's found so for people that don't know
[36:03.000 --> 36:15.000]  what this ade is and how it was predicted by all the top experts and how it's now confirmed to be here Mike Adams is going to lay this out and talk about the ramifications of what the study shows because each week
[36:15.000 --> 36:31.000]  it wanes in its effectiveness and your immune system becomes more not not just your some of your cells lowered your your t cells your killer cells are deactivated that's a side issue other antibodies are turned way up and that's what ade is
[36:31.000 --> 36:39.000]  so Mike Adams of naturalnews.com a great engineer great researchers got the best analysis of this out there tell us what this means
[36:39.000 --> 36:55.000]  well first of all Alex this is ocent or open source intelligence right so this has been on the he metrics website as of Friday it was still live on there I don't know if it's there now but this is do d this is their j a i c their
[36:55.000 --> 37:10.000]  artificial intelligence program so no one can argue that this is not some secret source somewhere this is open source intelligence what it shows a couple of very important things one is that the negative side effects from the vaccine
[37:10.000 --> 37:26.000]  get worse over time with each passing week and so the negative outcomes which includes hospital hospitalizations and ICU outcomes as well as deaths it's very bad at three to four months but it roughly doubles in about six months
[37:26.000 --> 37:41.000]  now this looks like a flat line projection so if we continue to project this out further in time to let's say nine months or 12 months which is coming up in our immediate future it looks like this is going to triple the three month negative effects
[37:41.000 --> 37:56.000]  or perhaps quadruple the three month negative effects at 12 months and it looks like Alex that we're going to see probably this is my estimation this is not in the report but by my estimation we're going to see millions of Americans suffering
[37:56.000 --> 38:13.000]  severe hospitalizations and deaths over the next six months due to the vaccines so that's where we are please continue Mike okay so the other major finding of this report is that the the number one most important factor that reduced serious
[38:13.000 --> 38:30.000]  complications over time was to have a previous COVID-19 infection so this document actually confirms that natural immunity is the number one best protective effect against negative outcomes following vaccination let me let me state that in a little bit different
[38:30.000 --> 38:45.000]  way because I know it sounds odd but a lot of people are taking the vaccines even though they've already had the illness and been sick and so we're finding as people that naturally already had it even though this injection is compromised them and set them up for death
[38:45.000 --> 38:53.000]  the body is so smart it's able to figure it out if it's already been in contact with it because it's the vaccine itself creating on the body is that right
[38:53.000 --> 39:09.000]  well yes that that's part of it but recognize that if here here's the weird start over this is this is really important is really important yeah if you plan to get vaccinated according to these data put out by the DoD the number one thing that you can do to
[39:09.000 --> 39:25.000]  survive the vaccine is to get COVID before you take the vaccine that's in the data that's what it shows so for those those people who have been infected and then they get the vaccine they are probably likely to have lower incidence of negative outcomes
[39:25.000 --> 39:37.000]  versus people who never had any infection and then the report says that shows how incredible our body is it gets it learns how it later gets the deadly vaccine and then isn't as apt to go into the ADE
[39:37.000 --> 39:53.000]  yeah exactly but but also notice the last slide of the slide 17 it also shows the ethnic groups that are most affected by this that's slide 17 and it shows that Native Americans have the highest rate of increase odds of negative outcomes
[39:53.000 --> 40:08.000]  so if you're Native American you're getting this vaccine you have about a 1.5 times higher risk of death and negative side effects compared to Caucasians if you're Hispanic it's about a roughly 1.3 to 1.4 times greater odds if you're black it's something more like
[40:08.000 --> 40:24.000]  1.25 roughly in that range but the point is this vaccine has ethnic effects that you know there have been many people out there warning about the possibility of this vaccine being a biological weapon for example you
[40:24.000 --> 40:40.000]  know Lewis Farrakhan warning about this and I have to say whether or not you agree with Lewis Farrakhan and other things this theory is plausible based on these data it does have a different effect based based on the ethnic background of the person being infected
[40:40.000 --> 40:55.000]  so there's no other way to interpret this again it's not some super secret data source this is data straight out of the DOD and the HUMETRICS platform which is the data aggregation and monitoring platform that Medicare uses to monitor long-term effects
[40:55.000 --> 41:09.000]  or health outcomes based on specific medical interventions that's right let's take our time and explain that your article at naturalnews.com does it it's on m4s.com you have links right to the Pentagon's own subgroup site it's there this is real you can find articles about how they're doing it
[41:09.000 --> 41:24.000]  so this is confirmed this just broke a Friday or Thursday this is just now starting to come out and it's what we already see in the real numbers it's what's already it's what we've already been reporting as people reading the news and talking to scientists
[41:24.000 --> 41:29.000]  this just confirms it with AI scanning millions of people.
[41:29.000 --> 41:41.000]  That's right 5.6 million people in this group and the data projections are very clear and again this is enhanced by the same artificial intelligence system that the DOD is using to try to project a supply line shortages
[41:41.000 --> 41:55.000]  which by the way we got to talk about that next segment the supply line I mean this is a wartime embargo against the United States in my view not letting the ship stock causing food shortages lots of scarcity.
[41:55.000 --> 42:03.000]  This is Bill back better and CNN says it's our fault we are the reason no it's Fauci and Bill Gates in the U.N.
[42:03.000 --> 42:17.000]  Yeah yeah exactly and we are facing a real dark winter that's their plan that's their engineering but a dark winter die off Alex and the other thing to keep in mind is that the CDC gathers census data on aggregate deaths in America
[42:17.000 --> 42:29.000]  but their data sets can be about two years behind schedule so they're not going to tell us the truth about the excess mortality caused by vaccines in 2021 until about 2023.
[42:29.000 --> 42:37.000]  So they're going to try to bury this for as long as possible and tell you that no you didn't see your neighbor die you didn't see a relative die after taking the vaccine no that was the variant.
[42:37.000 --> 42:51.000]  So it also shows how desperate they are that not just me but all over Democrat courts are getting rid of due process for conservatives and nationalists it is they are going for broke this is a foreign multinational takeover Mike Adams our guest
[42:51.000 --> 43:01.000]  we're going to come back and recap this and then I was on the same simpatico with Mike I want to get into supply chain breakdowns all over the western world and what that means straight ahead.
[43:01.000 --> 43:10.000]  People ask me Alex why did you come out with a new natural organic sleep aid when you already have knockout that works so well with eight natural ingredients.
[43:10.000 --> 43:22.000]  Well because when you've taken a certain organic blend for a decade like I've taken this product I came up with it doesn't work as well anymore that's the way herbs work but you go off in a while come back on it it works again.
[43:22.000 --> 43:35.000]  So what did I do I went to the developers and I said make a totally different formula with a lot of other known natural healthy compounds that make you sleep deep and restful because that's what helps your immune system and I want it to be at least twice as strong as knockout.
[43:35.000 --> 43:50.000]  Okay be careful when you take it it's incredibly strong its name down and out I don't have time to get into all the ingredients in it but it is extremely strong we are extremely proud of it it is exclusively available at infowarstore.com 50% off right now.
[43:50.000 --> 44:00.000]  Sold out for more than four months now back at stock get your down and out and your knockout at infowarstore.com today I thank you for your support because it keeps us on the air.
[44:20.000 --> 44:37.000]  That so many people fought and died and bled and sweat for and now we're just throwing it all away and I see the general public in a medically induced scientifically induced behavioral psychologically controlled.
[44:37.000 --> 44:54.000]  20 and I know we're being fed into this globalist meat grinder and it's so incredibly sad but this is the process of birth and then growth and then falling apart and then degenerating collapsing and then coming back to life again.
[44:54.000 --> 45:02.000]  It's just the globalist are actively trying to steer and control this process of decadence and collapse to actually end the species as we know it.
[45:02.000 --> 45:09.000]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone from beta testing to operational.
[45:09.000 --> 45:23.000]  The globalist are out on the open with their planetary depopulation takeover their robot takeover but the good news is we've been working and you've been working and others have been working across the planet for decades to get ready for this to be able to find it off.
[45:23.000 --> 45:29.000]  Humanity is strong we're incredible and if we're aware of the attack that's happening we have a real chance of defeating it.
[45:29.000 --> 45:38.000]  If we ask God for guidance we will defeat it. So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is essential and warning others is absolutely essential.
[45:38.000 --> 45:47.000]  And at the same time supporting Info Wars by buying high quality products to keep us on air is essential because they're great products for you and your family and they're also funding our operation.
[45:47.000 --> 46:02.000]  InfoWarsStore.com. InfoWarsStore.com is incredible. A lot of our products that have been sold out because the supply chain breakdowns are back in like bodies, vasobetes and others so get them today at InfoWarsStore.com and I thank you for being part of the resistance.
[46:17.000 --> 46:29.000]  The injection is not ready yet and so I need all of you to stay indoors for the next 15 days to flatten the can.
[46:29.000 --> 46:48.000]  I also need you to wear masks and I also need you to only shop at mega corporations that way we can consolidate control and bankrupt the world economy leaving companies that only I own profitable.
[46:48.000 --> 47:02.000]  You will then be my slaves. Oh, and then you'll get that special shot of rhythm from Cobra who will remove your immune system so you'll be depended on me for the rest of your miserable lives.
[47:18.000 --> 47:47.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live. I'm your host Alex Jones. Mike Adams with us 15 minutes to the next hour and we're going to get into Democrats caught again in major false flag attacks including KKK attacks, rape attacks,
[47:47.000 --> 47:56.000]  you name it, that's even Newsweek reporting on that. I'm going to be getting to that coming up after Mike leaves us and then Harrison Smith's going to host Sunday Live at night.
[47:56.000 --> 48:04.000]  He's got so much to cover, so many clips, so many calls. But I want to finish up with this and then get into the supply chain because Mike, you're a major business owner.
[48:04.000 --> 48:14.000]  You supply a lot of things around the world in the country. You're very prolific like we are. You experience what we experience, trying to get high quality products for your supplements and other things.
[48:14.000 --> 48:25.000]  Sometimes we're sort of six, eight months because we won't cut quality or buy from China. So I want to talk about that here in a few minutes, but just going back to this because we could talk 10 hours about this to have the Pentagon's main AI program.
[48:25.000 --> 48:34.000]  That's all over the news, monitoring deaths, monitoring what's happening. And then they just put out a report, what it does, and they're honest about it, but no political statements are in it.
[48:34.000 --> 48:50.000]  And it says that you're way more likely to die if you've had these shots, that it's erasing your regular immune system and then making your immune system turn way up, though, if it comes into contact with a similar virus, not just COVID, but any other coronavirus.
[48:50.000 --> 48:58.000]  I mean, for those that don't know historically what this means and why all these top scientists were warning about ADE, you should probably spend some time on that.
[48:58.000 --> 49:07.000]  Well, this is following exactly what people like Sherry Tenpenny warned about, and also Dr. Richard M. Fleming, who you've had on, I think, yesterday as well.
[49:07.000 --> 49:17.000]  This is what the animal studies showed when they tried to develop a vaccine for SARS coronavirus variants early on, many years ago. This is why the animals were dying.
[49:17.000 --> 49:24.000]  So there's really no surprises in this. The surprise would be if people weren't dying from this vaccine.
[49:24.000 --> 49:34.000]  So everything that's showing is tracking right along with our worst fears, and it means that we're probably headed for a real die-off dark winter.
[49:34.000 --> 49:37.000]  They're going to try to cover it up desperately, but they won't be able to stop it.
[49:37.000 --> 49:51.000]  So Alex, their strategy is going to be what do they blame instead of the vaccine? They're going to have to blame the unvaccinated, even if they get more and more a higher percentage of the American public to be vaccinated, they're going to still have to blame the unvaccinated.
[49:51.000 --> 49:56.000]  But yeah, antibody-dependent enhancement. This is a very real phenomenon. It is kicking in.
[49:56.000 --> 50:01.000]  And don't forget that Delta's not the last variant. They probably have.
[50:01.000 --> 50:18.000]  Remember the EcoHealth Alliance proposal to DARPA and the coverage of that by drastic that organization, and they confirmed there were hundreds of variants of SARS-CoV-2 that had been created through the NIH Fauci funding of that whole operation.
[50:18.000 --> 50:21.000]  So folks, this has only just begun.
[50:21.000 --> 50:26.000]  And I figured, Mike, we didn't talk before you came on about all the details, but I'd have it ready for you.
[50:26.000 --> 50:41.000]  The London Telegraph Wuhan scientists plan to release coronavirus particles into bat-taves leaked papers reveal with nanotech to burrow through the skin and the lungs, which you and General Flynn and Dr. Bartlett have been saying for now six, eight months,
[50:41.000 --> 50:49.000]  clearly is happening the way it's regionally hitting Texas, Missouri regionally hitting South Dakota regionally hitting Florida when we had the lowest numbers.
[50:49.000 --> 50:56.000]  And the experts in the Pentagon told me, they said, Alice, we can't tell you how we know this, but that Dr. Bartlett told me this a while ago off air.
[50:56.000 --> 51:04.000]  And now he's confirmed that on air that, you know, he talked to Flynn and Flynn was, you know, the head of operations in 2017 and had access to this.
[51:04.000 --> 51:17.000]  By the way, Flynn's going to be in studio soon. I'm going to leave it at that. And Flynn was telling people off record just, you know, six months ago was saying, hey, they're spraying this out on the public.
[51:17.000 --> 51:22.000]  This isn't being naturally spread. They're releasing a nanotech form of the virus.
[51:22.000 --> 51:31.000]  And now that's in their own Peter Dazik reports from Fauci to the Pentagon trying to get them to spend $14 million on this in 2017.
[51:31.000 --> 51:36.000]  So that's why Flynn knew about this, but didn't say it was classified. He just said, I think that's what's happening. And now it's come out.
[51:36.000 --> 51:39.000]  So so this is again beyond bombshell.
[51:39.000 --> 51:47.000]  And once again, we are citing now public documents. So what you're referring to is absolutely correct. They talked about aerosolized vaccination.
[51:47.000 --> 51:55.000]  And that was in the the proposal, the EcoHealth Alliance proposal to DARPA, which DARPA rejected because even DARPA said this is too crazy.
[51:55.000 --> 52:05.000]  But understand they were talking about skin penetrating toxic nanoparticles, which were the spike proteins. And again, when they say aerosolized vaccination, what they mean is an aerosolized release.
[52:05.000 --> 52:15.000]  So can they do aerosolized releases of these toxic nanoparticles this coming winter? Could they release this in the United States? Could they target a particular city?
[52:15.000 --> 52:21.000]  Have they already done so in the past? Personally, this is my opinion, Alex, but I believe they've already done so.
[52:21.000 --> 52:29.000]  And I think they're planning to do so again. And I think they are going to continue to commit genocide against the not just the American people,
[52:29.000 --> 52:36.000]  but everybody around the world to try to drive people into the vaccines while they're crashing the economy and causing widespread suffering and death and destitution.
[52:36.000 --> 52:44.000]  And as we said, as we said 20 months ago here on air, they will then blame the unvaccinated for the vaccinated dying and others.
[52:44.000 --> 52:56.000]  But to cover it up, they'll then just spray the general public like my dad and countless others and almost kill them. And then now we have General Flynn again telling folks a year ago and six months ago and three months ago,
[52:56.000 --> 53:05.000]  privately, no, these are nanoparticles being sprayed by them that they developed and that with the Chai comms. And now we have the documents where they did it.
[53:05.000 --> 53:08.000]  I mean, we have them, Mike. And so it's incredible.
[53:08.000 --> 53:21.000]  Well, and don't forget the military replacement strategy that's now in play with Governor Hochel announcing she's firing all the nurses, the hospital workers who were unvaccinated last year and they were fine.
[53:21.000 --> 53:35.000]  Now this year, they're being fired. They're taking the people with natural immunity who would be the most qualified to function in a hospital environment and they're kicking them to the curb and then bringing in National Guard military troops in New York City.
[53:35.000 --> 53:40.000]  Well, this model Alex is going to be replicated across the country with first responders.
[53:40.000 --> 53:49.000]  So as they start to fire police officers, sheriff's deputies, ambulance drivers, paramedics, EMTs and so on, guess who's going to replace them at least in the blue states.
[53:49.000 --> 53:56.000]  It's going to be National Guard, i.e. military troops driving the ambulances, military troops driving.
[53:56.000 --> 54:06.000]  And it's getting used to martial law. This is all the lockdowns or martial law drills. 20 months ago, we predicted after the lockdowns by the next winter they would have troops in the streets because it's a formula.
[54:06.000 --> 54:15.000]  They've already done it in Australia. And here's the headline. How America ruined Christmas. Oh, it's our fault. We didn't take all the shots. That's why the ships won't come off from China.
[54:15.000 --> 54:26.000]  Oh, build back better the UN Klaus Schwab great reset statement. So, so here it is, ladies and gentlemen, that's why Hillary and them are so happy because they are just ruthless killers.
[54:26.000 --> 54:33.000]  No, it's not America that's to blame. It's the COVID-19 great reset of Klaus Schwab, ladies and gentlemen.
[54:33.000 --> 54:45.000]  My prediction is people are going to see troops on the streets by Christmas and they're going to see bodies piling up in certain areas, of course, with a false narrative stating no, it couldn't have been the vaccines, but this is what we're going to see.
[54:45.000 --> 54:55.000]  This is the winter die off. This is the sort of soft coup military replacement of the infrastructure of first responders and medical workers.
[54:55.000 --> 55:05.000]  And even you may have even at some point troops in certain areas at grocery stores checking your vaccine passports before you're allowed to come in and shop for food.
[55:05.000 --> 55:12.000]  And in Israel, they've already announced that people who had two vaccines, but not the third one are no longer, you no longer have your freedom.
[55:12.000 --> 55:20.000]  Your green pass is revoked. You're only a double vaxxer, not a triple vaxxer. And then that's going to get updated to quadruple vaxxers soon.
[55:20.000 --> 55:27.000]  And then the triple vaxxers will be revoked. You're going to have to keep getting injected with spike proteins until you die or you stand up and say enough.
[55:27.000 --> 55:35.000]  But by that time, how much damage have you undergone? Do you have a vascular system remaining? Do you even have a neurological system that's still functioning?
[55:35.000 --> 55:46.000]  And by the way, sorry, Alex, if I'm running on here, but we're seeing more vaxxidents as well. The tow truck drivers and the ambulance drivers, they know all across America, they're responding to more and more traffic accidents.
[55:46.000 --> 55:51.000]  These are caused by people having blood clots, you know, the microclots as they're driving and they're losing...
[55:51.000 --> 55:57.000]  All the British government came out and said record heart attacks, blood clots up 25%, heart attacks up 25% from the blood clots.
[55:57.000 --> 56:03.000]  And exactly now when there's mass death at the hospital, the military will be there to control it. It's a martial law atmosphere.
[56:03.000 --> 56:07.000]  We're being inducted into the Great Reset into the communist takeover.
[56:07.000 --> 56:16.000]  That's right. And I'm almost sorry to bring this up, but you know where this is going with Joe Biden signing the executive order that says they can take you away for a measles infection.
[56:16.000 --> 56:25.000]  To your listeners, do you realize that the CDC can declare a measles outbreak in an entire area? They can say this neighborhood has measles.
[56:25.000 --> 56:31.000]  And that is the shielding area where they're going to, quote, lock everybody else down to protect them from a, quote, neighborhood.
[56:31.000 --> 56:37.000]  And they can take you out of your homes. They can put you in a green zone camp that they've described on their own website.
[56:37.000 --> 56:40.000]  And by the way, this has already happened in Australia and they're only ratcheting up there.
[56:40.000 --> 56:45.000]  The documents came out permanent. They tend to have millions of the population live in camps basically forever.
[56:45.000 --> 56:50.000]  Mike Adams, naturalloves.com, stay there. Folks, this is not a drill. You know it's not a game now.
[56:50.000 --> 56:55.000]  I can tell you that I've been around other big national talk show hosts and others. Everybody knows it's the end.
[56:55.000 --> 56:58.000]  Everybody understands this. And I feel so sorry for the public.
[56:58.000 --> 57:03.000]  That's what people ask. Hey, they say you lost your lawsuit. You don't get a jury trial.
[57:03.000 --> 57:06.000]  People go, that's unconstitutional. Seventh Amendment. They don't care.
[57:06.000 --> 57:10.000]  They've all been told the country's going down and they think they're the winners.
[57:10.000 --> 57:15.000]  But of course they won't. Everybody in the system that served it is going down as well.
[57:15.000 --> 57:17.000]  In fact, they're most of the people that have taken the shots.
[57:17.000 --> 57:21.000]  It's going to be Democrats dying in mass from the injections they've taken.
[57:21.000 --> 57:27.000]  I mean, this is biblical. Get right with God. Get prepared. Get ready because this is going down.
[57:27.000 --> 57:34.000]  This is going down. This is the reality. You've got to read the article. You've got to understand what the ADE is.
[57:34.000 --> 57:39.000]  You've got to warn everybody you know. All right, we'll be right back with our number two, ladies and gentlemen,
[57:39.000 --> 57:42.000]  and any one of these broadcasts to be our last, okay?
[57:42.000 --> 57:45.000]  I hope we're going to still be here in a year or a month, but we don't know.
[57:45.000 --> 57:58.000]  But don't take anything for granted. Warn everyone you know now. You are the Paul Revere's.
[58:16.000 --> 58:20.000]  Very popular. Twice as strong as knockout. Probably too strong for some people.
[58:20.000 --> 58:24.000]  Totally different formula. Down and out is back in stock. 50% off.
[58:24.000 --> 58:30.000]  We've extended the sale on Winter Sun and Ultra 12, 50% off, and also on Deep Earth Crystal iodine.
[58:30.000 --> 58:34.000]  Survival still X2. It's all 40 and 50% off for one week only.
[58:34.000 --> 58:38.000]  Take advantage of it and fund the InfoWare. And I thank you all for your support.
[58:38.000 --> 58:48.000]  It's a win-win. These are things that make you healthy, make your life better, and they fund the InfoWare.
[58:48.000 --> 59:09.000]  Again, all we lose is if you don't take action right now.
[59:19.000 --> 59:26.000]  This is nothing more than a top-down vertical consolidation of the world economy.
[59:26.000 --> 59:29.000]  Because they couldn't take our guns and because we wouldn't bow.
[59:29.000 --> 59:34.000]  Because the left, which is the ideology of this world government system, couldn't win.
[59:34.000 --> 59:37.000]  They released a biological weapon on us.
[59:37.000 --> 59:41.000]  Now we know two years ago, we learned about it about 20 months ago.
[59:41.000 --> 59:45.000]  It's that simple. They can't meet us because of our free speech and our guns.
[59:45.000 --> 59:49.000]  So the Global Corporate Combine released COVID-19, and you know the rest is history.
[59:49.000 --> 59:51.000]  Expose this paradigm and we win.
[59:55.000 --> 59:58.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:00:08.000 --> 1:00:12.000]  We are now back live. Some stations don't care this first five minutes of each hour.
[1:00:12.000 --> 1:00:17.000]  We're going to get into the design great reset that's already starving the third world to death,
[1:00:17.000 --> 1:00:20.000]  collapsing their population to you, and then organizing to invade us.
[1:00:20.000 --> 1:00:28.000]  And then here already, the major shortages here that are even worse in Europe, Australia, and of course, right there in the UK.
[1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:32.000]  We're going to show you some video of the big food lines and the Prime Minister admitting that next segment.
[1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:36.000]  But Mike, everything we predicted last year unfolded.
[1:00:36.000 --> 1:00:38.000]  Now we're here laying this down.
[1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:45.000]  This is clearly their cover for the world collapse to bring in the world ID based around the vaccine passport.
[1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:48.000]  What can the average person do to lessen the blow?
[1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:51.000]  What can Congress do? Because I see great people like Rand Paul and others.
[1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:53.000]  They don't seem to know how much danger we're all in.
[1:00:53.000 --> 1:01:00.000]  He's confronting Fauci. He's talking about illegal spying, you know, but they're still operating from their cocoon.
[1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:03.000]  Like everything's okay, but it's not okay.
[1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:07.000]  I mean, everything's falling apart and the hospitals are now full of the vaccinated.
[1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:09.000]  They were seriously ill.
[1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:14.000]  I'm not sure they realize how close we are to the end of the American Empire period.
[1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:16.000]  The end of the dollar.
[1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:26.000]  Once you see the only way that they're keeping this going and the way that Biden is bribing all of the Democrat groups to carry out more voter fraud on the ground is through money printing.
[1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:29.000]  So the money printing allows them to distribute these trillions of dollars.
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:31.000]  They call it, you know, a COVID stimulus.
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:35.000]  But of course, as you know, almost none of it goes to anything related to COVID.
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:40.000]  This just goes, gets funneled into other groups to keep the Democrats in power.
[1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:45.000]  So once the money printing machine stops, it will be, of course, catastrophic for the nation.
[1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:49.000]  It would mean the end of America as we know it, at least.
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:58.000]  It would perhaps parallel in many ways the Soviet Empire collapse of 1991, which began as a default on debt three days earlier.
[1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:01.000]  Of course, that's a simplification of it, but that was a big part of it.
[1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:07.000]  But once the money machine stops, they can no longer bribe everybody to keep playing along with the Democrats.
[1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:12.000]  Even the CDC would run out of money to keep bribing celebrities to push vaccines, for example.
[1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:13.000]  And let's be clear.
[1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:18.000]  It's obviously the globalist above it all maneuvering us and others into a collapse.
[1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  Europe can't get cold.
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:23.000]  China can't get cold because the money's devalued and they've been shutting down coal production.
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:27.000]  I mean, we can see the mega corporations are orchestrating this collapse.
[1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:33.000]  It's going to be an engineered famine situation, a release of another bioweapon,
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:38.000]  an energy collapse resulting in at least regional power grid disruptions,
[1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:45.000]  and then followed by, at the worst possible time, in my opinion, they're going to cause an economic catastrophe,
[1:02:45.000 --> 1:02:51.000]  which may be bank holidays, it may eventually be the actual collapse of the dollar itself.
[1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:54.000]  But we can't know the timing, so I'm not making that prediction for this winter.
[1:02:54.000 --> 1:02:56.000]  It's just we know that's inevitable.
[1:02:56.000 --> 1:02:57.000]  It's going to happen.
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:03:02.000]  And they're probably going to end up printing a trillion dollars a week before very long.
[1:03:02.000 --> 1:03:06.000]  So, you know, 3.5 trillion dollars they're talking about right now, they may cut that to 2 trillion,
[1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:09.000]  but it's trillions a month at this point.
[1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:11.000]  It's going to be a trillion a week soon.
[1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:14.000]  And then the blowout, it's just inevitable.
[1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:15.000]  It's very close.
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:20.000]  And that's why they're getting troops on the streets and getting us used to hearing the Americans of the terrorist
[1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:22.000]  and those that question open borders of the terrorist.
[1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:27.000]  You've got 80,000, this is mainline news, the Mexican government says from Haiti,
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:32.000]  marching towards the Texas border now, they're releasing 80% of those that have already gotten here.
[1:03:32.000 --> 1:03:34.000]  I mean, this is going to be incredible.
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:40.000]  Well, I also think the most important survival strategy for the red states like Texas and Florida is
[1:03:40.000 --> 1:03:41.000]  nullification.
[1:03:41.000 --> 1:03:47.000]  And you saw Nebraska the other day, the governor of Nebraska announced they would not honor the attempted new IRS rule
[1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:49.000]  of reporting transactions over $600.
[1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:50.000]  That's a nullification.
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:58.000]  What Texas needs to do in my opinion is to nullify the FDA, legalize ivermectin, save the lives of the people of Texas.
[1:03:58.000 --> 1:04:04.000]  Joe Biden's waging war against the red states, even with restrictions of monoclonal antibodies, for example,
[1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:06.000]  which will produce more casualties.
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:09.000]  We now have reached a, I wouldn't quite call it a civil war.
[1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:12.000]  I would call it a nullification stage for survival.
[1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:20.000]  Texas must take hold of its border, must take hold of medicine, must take hold of big pharma, get big pharma out of the system.
[1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:22.000]  Otherwise, Texas goes down with the blue states.
[1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:23.000]  That's my opinion.
[1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:24.000]  I agree.
[1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:25.000]  And I want to say something about Greg Abbott.
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:27.000]  I don't want to attack Abbott just to attack him.
[1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:29.000]  He did a bad thing last year with lockdowns and all that.
[1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:30.000]  I want to believe in him.
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:31.000]  I want to think he's good.
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:32.000]  I want to believe in DeSantis.
[1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:40.000]  But he keeps putting out video of armored vehicles and Humvees and DHS vehicles and, you know, Texas state police down there.
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:45.000]  But when they grab the illegals coming across, they give them to the feds who release them.
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:47.000]  So it's all show.
[1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:49.000]  It's, it's, it's show.
[1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:50.000]  We're coming when we come back.
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:53.000]  Back in 60 seconds with Mike Adams and naturalloves.com.
[1:04:53.000 --> 1:04:55.000]  And folks, I agree with this analysis.
[1:04:55.000 --> 1:04:57.000]  This is, we're in deep trouble.
[1:04:57.000 --> 1:05:23.000]  I mean, wow, this is historic.
[1:05:23.000 --> 1:05:28.000]  It is a product specifically designed to establish healthy drains, pipes and overall plumbing systems.
[1:05:28.000 --> 1:05:35.000]  Bio drain pro digest grease, fats, oil, sludge, paper and organic matter with ease.
[1:05:35.000 --> 1:05:42.000]  It contains no chemicals, no GMOs and is safe for black gray holding tanks, sewer hoses and plumbing.
[1:05:42.000 --> 1:05:44.000]  It is also human and animal safe.
[1:05:44.000 --> 1:05:48.000]  Get up to 20 treatments with the scoop for easy applications.
[1:05:48.000 --> 1:05:53.000]  Say goodbye to drain problems, gas buildup and odor guaranteed.
[1:05:53.000 --> 1:05:55.000]  Just pour and add water.
[1:05:55.000 --> 1:05:56.000]  It's that simple.
[1:05:56.000 --> 1:06:25.000]  Visit the biopros.com and see for yourself.
[1:06:25.000 --> 1:06:29.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:06:29.000 --> 1:06:32.000]  All right, I want to explain something that's very elementary.
[1:06:32.000 --> 1:06:34.000]  I know our general audience gets this.
[1:06:34.000 --> 1:06:35.000]  That's why you tune in.
[1:06:35.000 --> 1:06:36.000]  You're already informed.
[1:06:36.000 --> 1:06:40.000]  You just want to get more info and share info and are concerned.
[1:06:40.000 --> 1:06:44.000]  But remember what happened last year all over the world.
[1:06:44.000 --> 1:06:49.000]  They had to dump millions of gallons per country or even per region of cow's milk.
[1:06:49.000 --> 1:06:51.000]  People said, why don't they give that to the poor?
[1:06:51.000 --> 1:06:54.000]  Well, there's, there, the stores are closed.
[1:06:54.000 --> 1:06:55.000]  They get it.
[1:06:55.000 --> 1:06:56.000]  They can't refrigerate it.
[1:06:56.000 --> 1:06:58.000]  So the cows keep producing it.
[1:06:58.000 --> 1:07:00.000]  So you've got to get it and then dump it.
[1:07:00.000 --> 1:07:02.000]  They tried to give away as much as they could.
[1:07:02.000 --> 1:07:04.000]  There's not an infrastructure.
[1:07:04.000 --> 1:07:06.000]  Okay.
[1:07:06.000 --> 1:07:09.000]  And so we've got all that happening.
[1:07:09.000 --> 1:07:12.000]  We've got our borders collapsing.
[1:07:12.000 --> 1:07:18.000]  And now all over the world, they're having to call animals because there's not enough feed to feed them.
[1:07:18.000 --> 1:07:23.000]  And then the workers aren't coming to work on British and German and French farms because
[1:07:23.000 --> 1:07:25.000]  they're paid not to work.
[1:07:25.000 --> 1:07:30.000]  And in Klaus Schwab admitted a year and a half ago, he said, we're going to have ongoing
[1:07:30.000 --> 1:07:34.000]  lockdowns, rolling lockdowns that will create a collapse in this unsustainable economy.
[1:07:34.000 --> 1:07:35.000]  But it is sustainable.
[1:07:35.000 --> 1:07:36.000]  He collapsed it.
[1:07:36.000 --> 1:07:40.000]  And then when it collapses, we'll bring in the new global system and the new guaranteed
[1:07:40.000 --> 1:07:42.000]  social credit score and guaranteed income.
[1:07:42.000 --> 1:07:44.000]  This is the corporate takeover.
[1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:46.000]  They've got endless cash, endless made up currency.
[1:07:46.000 --> 1:07:50.000]  They've got to kill our real economy to make us come hat in the hand to be slaves,
[1:07:50.000 --> 1:07:52.000]  posing it as saviors.
[1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:57.000]  Even as Boris Johnson comes out yesterday and gives a statement, farmers are announcing
[1:07:57.000 --> 1:08:00.000]  they're going to have to call millions of sheep and cows.
[1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:02.000]  Here's another one.
[1:08:02.000 --> 1:08:09.000]  We have aerial footage shows long lines for fuel in dirt in the UK trying to get fuel.
[1:08:09.000 --> 1:08:12.000]  So these are the shortages that are being caused.
[1:08:12.000 --> 1:08:13.000]  Here's Boris Johnson.
[1:08:13.000 --> 1:08:15.000]  All this is already happening here.
[1:08:15.000 --> 1:08:20.000]  Here is the trader in chief that poses a patriot who's a horrible globalist.
[1:08:20.000 --> 1:08:21.000]  Here he is.
[1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:27.000]  Is Rishi Sunak right in saying that these problems, these delays could go on until Christmas?
[1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:34.000]  I think what you're seeing is Rishi is right in very good terms.
[1:08:34.000 --> 1:08:41.000]  But what you're seeing depends on how you interpret what he's saying.
[1:08:41.000 --> 1:08:42.000]  It's not difficult.
[1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:44.000]  They're going to go on until Christmas.
[1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:51.760]  But what you're certainly seeing is the stresses and strains caused in a U.K. economy that
[1:08:51.760 --> 1:08:59.400]  is now the fastest growing in the G7 when people voted for change in 2016 and when people
[1:08:59.400 --> 1:09:00.400]  voted for change.
[1:09:00.400 --> 1:09:01.920]  Okay, so that's basically the BS there.
[1:09:01.920 --> 1:09:04.120]  So let's expand on this.
[1:09:04.120 --> 1:09:07.560]  Klaus Schwab, the U.N., all of them said we want to end the industrial society, we want
[1:09:07.560 --> 1:09:12.080]  to end plenty, you'll have nothing, you'll own nothing, they said all that.
[1:09:12.080 --> 1:09:15.920]  They fund Extinction Rebellion, they fund all the fake environmental groups, it's a
[1:09:15.920 --> 1:09:19.720]  power grab, they're a eugenicist, they're new populations, and they said last year
[1:09:19.720 --> 1:09:23.600]  and this year and the one in Guardian and the New York Times, oh, the COVID lockdown
[1:09:23.600 --> 1:09:26.040]  was great, it teaches us to live locked down.
[1:09:26.040 --> 1:09:29.600]  It teaches us not to have anything, it was so good for the earth, and now we're going
[1:09:29.600 --> 1:09:32.200]  to get rid of meat, you're not going to have meat anymore because they're going to kill
[1:09:32.200 --> 1:09:33.200]  it all.
[1:09:33.200 --> 1:09:37.960]  I mean, this is really happening, Mike Adams, lay out what's really going on and how we stop
[1:09:37.960 --> 1:09:38.960]  it.
[1:09:38.960 --> 1:09:43.560]  So part of the structure of a globalist society in the long supply lines is that it prevents
[1:09:43.560 --> 1:09:48.360]  or presents opportunities for single source restrictions that have a domino effect throughout
[1:09:48.360 --> 1:09:49.360]  the supply line.
[1:09:49.360 --> 1:09:54.680]  So you're talking about energy in Europe, so natural gas shortages end up resulting in
[1:09:54.680 --> 1:09:59.720]  a shortage of fertilizer production, and because there are not fertilizer plants producing
[1:09:59.720 --> 1:10:05.560]  fertilizer for agricultural use, their byproduct is carbon dioxide which is used to kill the
[1:10:05.560 --> 1:10:07.040]  animals for slaughter.
[1:10:07.040 --> 1:10:10.040]  So then you don't have enough CO2 to slaughter the animals.
[1:10:10.040 --> 1:10:15.200]  So then the animals end up getting killed on the farms, but then just left to be picked
[1:10:15.200 --> 1:10:16.360]  by the birds, essentially.
[1:10:16.360 --> 1:10:20.400]  I mean, there's going to be a calling of these animals, they're going to be, I don't know,
[1:10:20.400 --> 1:10:25.240]  shot or bulldozed, or I mean, probably some horrific death of all these animals rather
[1:10:25.240 --> 1:10:28.000]  than the normal way they're slaughtered with CO2.
[1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:33.600]  So the ripple effect then leads to humans starving and having reduced food supplies
[1:10:33.600 --> 1:10:36.440]  and then food inflation resulting from that as well.
[1:10:36.440 --> 1:10:42.080]  So think about this, I mean, Alex, this is why if, I should say, when America rebuilds
[1:10:42.080 --> 1:10:48.960]  from this, because we will rebuild, we must have local redundants, suppliers for rare
[1:10:48.960 --> 1:10:54.640]  earth metals, for energy, for manufacturing, for steel production, all of these things.
[1:10:54.640 --> 1:10:57.680]  We, I mean, Trump was right all along.
[1:10:57.680 --> 1:10:58.880]  Nationalism is the answer.
[1:10:58.880 --> 1:11:02.200]  We have to have local national production.
[1:11:02.200 --> 1:11:05.600]  Even if it costs more money, you have the redundancy.
[1:11:05.600 --> 1:11:08.040]  And redundancy is what we do not have in the world right now.
[1:11:08.040 --> 1:11:11.440]  And that's why there are hundreds of ships parked outside the ports on both the West
[1:11:11.440 --> 1:11:16.400]  Coast and the East Coast with the globalists locking down the ports on purpose to cause
[1:11:16.400 --> 1:11:17.400]  these restrictions.
[1:11:17.400 --> 1:11:21.480]  I mean, look, Alex, this is like, this is the naval blockade that America did to Japan
[1:11:21.480 --> 1:11:24.920]  in World War II to block fossil fuels from being shipped into Japan.
[1:11:24.920 --> 1:11:25.920]  And Mike, I want to back you up.
[1:11:25.920 --> 1:11:26.920]  I want to back you up.
[1:11:26.920 --> 1:11:29.160]  You got to come back on this week if you can do it on a weekday.
[1:11:29.160 --> 1:11:30.320]  You predicted it.
[1:11:30.320 --> 1:11:31.520]  We said it all year and a half ago.
[1:11:31.520 --> 1:11:34.760]  I predicted it because the UN said this is their plan.
[1:11:34.760 --> 1:11:38.680]  And they, they, they, the workers leave because if one person gets COVID, everything shuts
[1:11:38.680 --> 1:11:42.920]  down the supply chains, the factories, the truckers, the schools.
[1:11:42.920 --> 1:11:45.680]  But then meanwhile all China's never closed.
[1:11:45.680 --> 1:11:46.920]  It was all bull.
[1:11:46.920 --> 1:11:48.120]  We are shutting down.
[1:11:48.120 --> 1:11:50.400]  This is an economic consolidation.
[1:11:50.400 --> 1:11:54.880]  This is the end of the industrial world that the UN said they would do at the Rio de Janeiro
[1:11:54.880 --> 1:11:58.040]  meeting in 1992.
[1:11:58.040 --> 1:12:01.480]  That's agenda 21 that they launched in 2021, they said.
[1:12:01.480 --> 1:12:07.160]  And now by agenda 2030, they intended to depopulate the earth 90% in the next nine years.
[1:12:07.160 --> 1:12:08.280]  This is real.
[1:12:08.280 --> 1:12:12.240]  We keep telling people they're not playing games, Mike Adams.
[1:12:12.240 --> 1:12:16.680]  And remember what happened in Texas this February with the cold snap and the power plants shutting
[1:12:16.680 --> 1:12:17.680]  down?
[1:12:17.680 --> 1:12:21.520]  Well, news broke this morning, Alex, that in Germany a major coal-fired power plant
[1:12:21.520 --> 1:12:24.480]  has shut down because they can't get coal supplies.
[1:12:24.480 --> 1:12:26.920]  So again, single source restrictions.
[1:12:26.920 --> 1:12:31.120]  When they start restricting coal supplies, even the power plants in the United States,
[1:12:31.120 --> 1:12:34.280]  they're going to get regional power outages.
[1:12:34.280 --> 1:12:36.600]  And then that has a tipping point.
[1:12:36.600 --> 1:12:41.840]  There's a certain point where society, if enough things are disrupted simultaneously.
[1:12:41.840 --> 1:12:42.840]  It's dominoes.
[1:12:42.840 --> 1:12:43.840]  It cannot recovery.
[1:12:43.840 --> 1:12:44.840]  There's no recovery.
[1:12:44.840 --> 1:12:45.840]  Exactly.
[1:12:45.840 --> 1:12:47.920]  And Mike, again, we've been screaming this.
[1:12:47.920 --> 1:12:52.840]  We are explaining what just on time delivery and globalization is the opposite of sustainability.
[1:12:52.840 --> 1:12:55.880]  We are like a heroin addict totally strung out.
[1:12:55.880 --> 1:12:57.920]  And now the dominoes are already falling.
[1:12:57.920 --> 1:13:00.080]  People you know, the dominoes are already falling fast.
[1:13:00.080 --> 1:13:01.600]  We're deep into this now.
[1:13:01.600 --> 1:13:07.920]  We're deep into the antibody crisis, the poisoning of the shots.
[1:13:07.920 --> 1:13:10.840]  I mean, people better get right with God right now, Mike.
[1:13:10.840 --> 1:13:15.280]  And the government and the media, which set this whole thing up, I mean, the Biden regime,
[1:13:15.280 --> 1:13:20.440]  they're telling people, you know, don't store food, don't get ivermectin.
[1:13:20.440 --> 1:13:21.440]  Don't be ready.
[1:13:21.440 --> 1:13:24.800]  You know, don't have extra cash and certainly don't buy gold or silver or anything like
[1:13:24.800 --> 1:13:25.800]  that, right?
[1:13:25.800 --> 1:13:31.160]  There's all the exactly the wrong advice you're going to need food to make it through the
[1:13:31.160 --> 1:13:32.160]  dark winter.
[1:13:32.160 --> 1:13:33.160]  It's not just the winter.
[1:13:33.160 --> 1:13:36.160]  It's going to be a dark couple of years, frankly, of what's coming.
[1:13:36.160 --> 1:13:40.920]  The supply lines of the collapse of 2020 when you couldn't get toilet paper and things,
[1:13:40.920 --> 1:13:41.920]  that's nothing.
[1:13:41.920 --> 1:13:44.000]  That's a warm up round compared to what's coming.
[1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:49.040]  And the freeze in Texas and other states earlier this year, that's the warm up round.
[1:13:49.040 --> 1:13:51.240]  Alex, it's going to get so bad.
[1:13:51.240 --> 1:13:55.320]  I mean, I'm dedicated to staying on air as you are as long as possible.
[1:13:55.320 --> 1:14:00.560]  And frankly, the reason they're coming after info wars with the judgment that, you know,
[1:14:00.560 --> 1:14:02.520]  the witch trials, you don't even get a jury.
[1:14:02.520 --> 1:14:07.080]  The reason they're doing that is because I think they know there's going to be a secession
[1:14:07.080 --> 1:14:08.280]  or a nullification.
[1:14:08.280 --> 1:14:13.160]  We're going to have the Republic of Texas and info wars is going to be the news hub
[1:14:13.160 --> 1:14:16.480]  for the new free Texas, which is why you need to survive.
[1:14:16.480 --> 1:14:17.480]  That's my take.
[1:14:17.480 --> 1:14:20.480]  Well, I mean, for those that don't know, all we gave them every document, everything
[1:14:20.480 --> 1:14:22.600]  they ever asked for more than anybody ever did.
[1:14:22.600 --> 1:14:26.680]  They removed one judge, put a new one in, and she said, I'm the first hearing, first
[1:14:26.680 --> 1:14:27.680]  real hearing.
[1:14:27.680 --> 1:14:28.680]  I'm defaulting you.
[1:14:28.680 --> 1:14:29.680]  You never gave us one document.
[1:14:29.680 --> 1:14:31.040]  And then they lie all over the news.
[1:14:31.040 --> 1:14:35.960]  It's stunning to me that it just shows you, though, it's a symptom of this country being
[1:14:35.960 --> 1:14:36.960]  on his deathbed.
[1:14:36.960 --> 1:14:37.960]  Mike.
[1:14:37.960 --> 1:14:40.400]  Yeah, they're trying to take you down by any means and they've thrown out the rule
[1:14:40.400 --> 1:14:41.400]  of law.
[1:14:41.400 --> 1:14:46.760]  But in doing so, as I think your attorneys have said and Barnes as well, when they throw
[1:14:46.760 --> 1:14:50.920]  out the rule of law, they throw out the very pillars of sustainable society, we are now
[1:14:50.920 --> 1:14:53.160]  going to witness this collapse.
[1:14:53.160 --> 1:14:55.800]  It has begun and it is, I think, unstoppable.
[1:14:55.800 --> 1:14:58.680]  Now we have to write it out and prepare to rebuild.
[1:14:58.680 --> 1:14:59.680]  That's right.
[1:14:59.680 --> 1:15:03.520]  And I'm, imagine what the average leftist who's all about not being ready and being
[1:15:03.520 --> 1:15:04.720]  totally dependent.
[1:15:04.720 --> 1:15:07.800]  What are all of the leftist pedophiles and drug addicts going to do when everything
[1:15:07.800 --> 1:15:08.800]  collapses?
[1:15:08.800 --> 1:15:14.040]  Well, they're going to try to kill others to get the drugs and food that they want.
[1:15:14.040 --> 1:15:18.400]  But they have very little discipline and training and most of them will be killed themselves.
[1:15:18.400 --> 1:15:21.880]  And that's it, most of them are going to die.
[1:15:21.880 --> 1:15:26.640]  You know, my instincts, not just my intellect, but my instincts have like, I have 10 times
[1:15:26.640 --> 1:15:27.640]  the energy I ever had.
[1:15:27.640 --> 1:15:28.640]  I'm like, I'm 18.
[1:15:28.640 --> 1:15:31.800]  I can't stop working because I know this is going down.
[1:15:31.800 --> 1:15:32.800]  Can you feel it too, Mike?
[1:15:32.800 --> 1:15:35.080]  I mean, I just, it's incredible.
[1:15:35.080 --> 1:15:41.520]  I've been getting ready for this, you know, for many, many years and I'm not surprised
[1:15:41.520 --> 1:15:42.520]  that it's happening.
[1:15:42.520 --> 1:15:44.160]  I'm surprised how many people aren't yet awake.
[1:15:44.160 --> 1:15:45.680]  It's so obvious at this point.
[1:15:45.680 --> 1:15:47.320]  Well, it's happening now.
[1:15:47.320 --> 1:15:48.320]  It's not just obvious.
[1:15:48.320 --> 1:15:49.320]  You're right.
[1:15:49.320 --> 1:15:50.320]  It's, it's happening.
[1:15:50.320 --> 1:15:53.040]  The collapse is now happening orchestrated by Klaus Schwab.
[1:15:53.040 --> 1:15:54.040]  God help us.
[1:15:54.040 --> 1:15:55.040]  Thank you, Mike Adams.
[1:15:55.040 --> 1:15:56.040]  Amazing information.
[1:15:56.040 --> 1:15:57.040]  Thank you, Alex.
[1:15:57.040 --> 1:15:58.040]  We'll be right back.
[1:15:58.040 --> 1:15:59.040]  Stay with us.
[1:15:59.040 --> 1:16:07.560]  It's only been in the last 60 years that we've had satellites that can decently measure
[1:16:07.560 --> 1:16:09.040]  what's happening in the atmosphere.
[1:16:09.040 --> 1:16:13.040]  But if you look at all the different studies and reports about my NASA and other governments
[1:16:13.040 --> 1:16:17.600]  and other agencies, they all disagree on what's really happening with the climate.
[1:16:17.600 --> 1:16:22.520]  The only constant, the only great truth is change is the only constant.
[1:16:22.520 --> 1:16:27.880]  So, yes, climate change is totally real, but notice first they called it global freezing
[1:16:27.880 --> 1:16:31.240]  back in the 70s and 80s and then it's going to be global warming and when that didn't
[1:16:31.240 --> 1:16:34.880]  really happen the way they wanted it to, okay, now it's just climate change.
[1:16:34.880 --> 1:16:40.280]  But did you know that manmade climate change is a real thing when it comes to the United
[1:16:40.280 --> 1:16:45.480]  Nations and the Department of Energy and Bill Gates and the UN, they have weather control
[1:16:45.480 --> 1:16:50.680]  trees from 1979 and Bill Gates has been manipulating the weather for a very long time.
[1:16:50.680 --> 1:16:55.240]  In fact, back in 1994, two scientists won a Nobel Prize for an idea of spraying different
[1:16:55.240 --> 1:16:57.960]  particles out of jet engines to control the weather.
[1:16:57.960 --> 1:17:00.800]  So yes, manmade climate change is real.
[1:17:00.800 --> 1:17:04.560]  A month ago, we sold out of our first shipment in only three days.
[1:17:04.560 --> 1:17:08.840]  It is Rainforest Ultra, the cleanest, purest energy you're going to find anywhere.
[1:17:08.840 --> 1:17:13.840]  And now you've got a big shipment in and I'm offering it at 50% off yet again.
[1:17:13.840 --> 1:17:17.280]  You need to experience this for yourself and I know you're going to be hooked.
[1:17:17.280 --> 1:17:22.520]  It's got Guarana Seed, Alpha GPC, Green Coffee Bean, Alethra Root, Huramante Leaf, Green
[1:17:22.520 --> 1:17:26.840]  Tea Leafs, Ginko Leaf, Ashwagandha Root and more.
[1:17:26.840 --> 1:17:30.960]  Experience the power of Rainforest Ultra at 50% off.
[1:17:30.960 --> 1:17:35.080]  It comes in a liquid with a dropper, take it under the tongue and it hits me faster
[1:17:35.080 --> 1:17:38.400]  than any other natural energy product I've ever tried.
[1:17:38.400 --> 1:18:08.320]  So the placebo that they have used, that the FDA has allowed them to use, has often been
[1:18:08.320 --> 1:18:13.880]  another vaccine, a vaccine with a known adverse reaction profile that's causing death and
[1:18:13.880 --> 1:18:16.240]  damage in its own right.
[1:18:16.240 --> 1:18:23.400]  That it's the aluminum as an adjuvant in the vaccine, a known neurotoxin, a known immunotoxin,
[1:18:23.400 --> 1:18:29.960]  a known poison in human beings that is in the supposedly inert placebo, totally inappropriate.
[1:18:29.960 --> 1:18:34.240]  This is not good science, it is not science at all.
[1:18:34.240 --> 1:18:39.440]  It is an effort to cover up the true adverse reaction rates to these vaccines so that they
[1:18:39.440 --> 1:18:46.360]  can get through the low barrier of constraints put there by the FDA and onto the market.
[1:18:46.360 --> 1:19:15.640]  That is the only concern.
[1:19:16.640 --> 1:19:27.320]  The truth is, they've had to come out in the open to attack human freedom because they're
[1:19:27.320 --> 1:19:28.640]  actually losing.
[1:19:28.640 --> 1:19:31.760]  We have forced them out in the open.
[1:19:31.760 --> 1:19:35.960]  So as bad as these times are, and a lot of negative things are about to happen, realize
[1:19:35.960 --> 1:19:37.640]  humanity is winning.
[1:19:37.640 --> 1:19:42.760]  You've got to trust in the plan of God and trust in the plan of God's justice.
[1:19:42.760 --> 1:19:44.200]  That is invincible.
[1:19:44.200 --> 1:19:47.480]  That is ethereal, timeless, and unstoppable.
[1:19:47.480 --> 1:19:52.360]  So don't trust in man, trust in God, to lead God and direct your soul, and then take action
[1:19:52.360 --> 1:19:56.280]  against the globalists and realize, you've got my commitment from Alex Jones and my crew
[1:19:56.280 --> 1:19:57.280]  to you.
[1:19:57.280 --> 1:20:15.160]  We will never back down from the globalists and we will never surrender.
[1:20:15.160 --> 1:20:37.880]  What an incredible time to be alive, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:20:37.880 --> 1:20:43.200]  I have a very important special report we're going to air at the start of the next segment.
[1:20:43.200 --> 1:20:48.600]  And then he's got so much to cover tonight in Sunday Live, 6 to 8 p.m.
[1:20:48.600 --> 1:20:53.520]  I've asked Parrots and Smith who's going to be hosting this weekday morning's 8 a.m. American
[1:20:53.520 --> 1:20:57.760]  Journal here on the InfoWars Network, he's going to come in and finish the last segment
[1:20:57.760 --> 1:21:00.880]  and a half to tell you what's coming up, hit some other news he's got, and then he'll
[1:21:00.880 --> 1:21:04.520]  be back tomorrow morning at 8 a.m., and I'll be back at 11 a.m. at Owen Stroyer.
[1:21:04.520 --> 1:21:09.000]  We'll be back tomorrow at 3 p.m. Central, remember, the globalists are working around
[1:21:09.000 --> 1:21:12.880]  the clock to try to take us off the gear before I hit this final news and information I'm
[1:21:12.880 --> 1:21:15.480]  going to hit in these very, very serious times.
[1:21:15.480 --> 1:21:19.920]  I would just tell listeners, yeah, I told you you can go back, you heard it 100 times.
[1:21:19.920 --> 1:21:23.120]  20 months ago I said it's going to collapse the third world, we're going to be flooded
[1:21:23.120 --> 1:21:27.440]  with migrants and basically invaders from the globalist collapse from all over the world,
[1:21:27.440 --> 1:21:31.640]  the U.N. is going to organize them, bring them in to collapse the economy, tens of millions
[1:21:31.640 --> 1:21:36.120]  extra starved to death, that's now happened, that's mass murder, not caused by COVID, caused
[1:21:36.120 --> 1:21:37.800]  by the lockdowns.
[1:21:37.800 --> 1:21:42.440]  Much of Latin America and Africa is still under lockdowns because the U.N. controls them through
[1:21:42.440 --> 1:21:47.560]  the IMF World Bank and tell them to do that, to make their people flood up here, you're
[1:21:47.560 --> 1:21:51.800]  going to have food prices explode, there's global devaluation happening, we told you
[1:21:51.800 --> 1:21:56.280]  you'll start seeing power supply outages and it's all happening because Klaus Schwab wrote
[1:21:56.280 --> 1:22:00.840]  books saying, I've read four of his damn books, he's the former head of the Bilderberg
[1:22:00.840 --> 1:22:06.040]  Group, this is not a game, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:22:06.040 --> 1:22:11.400]  So yeah, I want to stay on air as long as possible and I sell things that I believe in
[1:22:11.400 --> 1:22:15.680]  and I think you need, so I sell a lot of great supplements, I sell a lot of great things
[1:22:15.680 --> 1:22:20.000]  that are good for your immune system, I sell things that fund our operation, books and
[1:22:20.000 --> 1:22:24.760]  films and t-shirts and highest quality water filtration, air filtration, at the lowest
[1:22:24.760 --> 1:22:29.160]  price they're going to find anywhere, I mean, Alexa Pure Breeze and Alexa Pure Pro water
[1:22:29.160 --> 1:22:33.800]  filters and air filters are highest rated out of dozens of top brands out there, there's
[1:22:33.800 --> 1:22:37.200]  hundreds of brands total, but there people go, wow, this is actually half the price of
[1:22:37.200 --> 1:22:43.080]  the stuff at Walmart, you know, water filters and it's the highest rated, how is that?
[1:22:43.080 --> 1:22:47.880]  Because we're not ripping you off, I would get ready, I would get prepared and yes,
[1:22:47.880 --> 1:22:51.800]  preparewithalix.com takes you right to the sub page on infowarsstore.com, that's the
[1:22:51.800 --> 1:22:56.240]  full catalog of the great patriots at my Patriots supply, they're in our back end, they take
[1:22:56.240 --> 1:23:00.000]  the orders daily and then it also helps fund our operation, the highest quality storeable
[1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:03.680]  food for the lowest price you're going to find, can you pay three, four times more
[1:23:03.680 --> 1:23:07.280]  and get more gourmet that tastes better, yeah, but for food that's good and nutritious
[1:23:07.280 --> 1:23:11.400]  and quality and a lot of it tastes excellent, most of it tastes, you know, really good,
[1:23:11.400 --> 1:23:15.160]  some taste okay, but that's just dishes I don't like, you're not going to find anything
[1:23:15.160 --> 1:23:19.440]  near it for this price, this is what I have for my family, it's what I bought for friends
[1:23:19.440 --> 1:23:23.440]  and others, it's what we got stockpiled here at the office because I know how serious the
[1:23:23.440 --> 1:23:29.240]  world is, we finally got big generators expensive hooked into everything in our own systems,
[1:23:29.240 --> 1:23:32.840]  I mean, we've done a lot of stuff, I'm going to leave it at that, I'm not going to tell
[1:23:32.840 --> 1:23:37.600]  you everything we've done to keep communications up and been very expensive because we need
[1:23:37.600 --> 1:23:41.800]  to be on air when they take everything down and if that means, I mean, the enemy already
[1:23:41.800 --> 1:23:46.880]  knows what we got, but if that means radio and satellite relays, if that means our own
[1:23:46.880 --> 1:23:53.480]  power supplies, if that means our own microwave relays, I mean, you name it, we got it, looks
[1:23:53.480 --> 1:23:58.160]  like the rebel base here folks and the imperial walkers are marching towards us and that means
[1:23:58.160 --> 1:24:02.640]  they're coming at you too, so people ask, how are you taking all this, man, I mean, I know
[1:24:02.640 --> 1:24:08.240]  what's going down, I'm ready for it, but understanding this, so who knows, it could be your last
[1:24:08.240 --> 1:24:14.840]  chance any day to get Ultra-12 or to get down and out sleep support or to get in-game or
[1:24:14.840 --> 1:24:19.960]  the new film COVID-Land or to get an Info Wars t-shirt, I mean, until we turn this around
[1:24:19.960 --> 1:24:23.560]  and arrest the globalists because they're not going to stop until we arrest them and
[1:24:23.560 --> 1:24:26.920]  our own leaders don't even know what's going on pretty much, they're starting to figure
[1:24:26.920 --> 1:24:31.520]  it out, so this is such a dangerous time, it's so important we stay on air, it's so
[1:24:31.520 --> 1:24:36.480]  important we come together and realize what's happening, so get the products at infowarstore.com,

[1:24:53.840 --> 1:25:01.160]  whole broadcast possible, so I just trust everything to God now, but the collapse has
[1:25:01.160 --> 1:25:02.160]  begun.
[1:25:02.160 --> 1:25:05.600]  All right, I'll be back tomorrow at 11am, I'm going to go to break and come back with
[1:25:05.600 --> 1:25:11.120]  a special report but let me hit these and tomorrow I'm going to air some clips out of this.
[1:25:11.120 --> 1:25:16.560]  Black woman masquerading as KKK clan member terrorized neighbors faces charges for months
[1:25:16.560 --> 1:25:22.000]  or the last year, someone would put KKK signs on and dresses a KKK person and run around
[1:25:22.000 --> 1:25:27.000]  the night and finally people recognized her handwriting versus notes they'd gotten before
[1:25:27.000 --> 1:25:30.840]  from her and the police got a search warrant and went in and she was the one doing it and
[1:25:30.840 --> 1:25:33.880]  it was all in her house. This is another example of how you're not supposed to question all
[1:25:33.880 --> 1:25:38.760]  these events that happened, mass shootings, you name it, and then of course, Jesse Smollett,
[1:25:38.760 --> 1:25:43.160]  you name it, you know, WMD's in Iraq, you name it, Gulf of Tonkin, you name it, Operation
[1:25:43.160 --> 1:25:47.480]  Northwoods, you name it, but here's another example of that, that's from Newsweek, here's
[1:25:47.480 --> 1:25:48.480]  one from the Daily Mail.
[1:25:48.480 --> 1:25:53.640]  Here's another one, baby in Roe v. Wade case was never aborted and just came out publicly,
[1:25:53.640 --> 1:25:58.440]  so has her mother, no one raped her, it was all made up, it was all a giant lie and she's
[1:25:58.440 --> 1:26:05.160]  alive, all a giant false flag to then kill 65 million babies at least in America and
[1:26:05.160 --> 1:26:12.320]  it pleases Hillary Clinton, that demonic witch so much, but here's the facts, you could say
[1:26:12.320 --> 1:26:18.880]  kill babies, they don't have rights, okay, how about all the adults dying from the vaccines
[1:26:18.880 --> 1:26:22.520]  and the Pentagon confirming that their immune systems are disappearing until they get hit
[1:26:22.520 --> 1:26:27.600]  by another outside virus and then they get the syndrome that kills them, that reports
[1:26:27.600 --> 1:26:32.960]  on infowars.com, we spent the whole first hour and a half or hour and 15 minutes breaking
[1:26:32.960 --> 1:26:37.840]  that down and then there's this, I've got to get to this tomorrow, there'll be so much
[1:26:37.840 --> 1:26:41.880]  news by then I probably won't, there's articles on infowars.com about it, there's articles
[1:26:41.880 --> 1:26:48.080]  on Gateway Pundit about it, it's so incredible, Biden went to a baseball game and got booed
[1:26:48.080 --> 1:26:54.440]  and they said F Joe Biden like to do everywhere and so the White House re-released the video
[1:26:54.440 --> 1:26:58.760]  with a dub tape saying we love Joe Biden and said it was real and then released a bunch
[1:26:58.760 --> 1:27:06.280]  of other crap, I mean folks and it gets worse, at NASCAR they were saying F Joe Biden and
[1:27:06.280 --> 1:27:09.720]  so the commentator changed it to the winner and said oh they're saying they love you,
[1:27:09.720 --> 1:27:13.960]  they're saying your name while they chant, I'm not going to play it here because we cut
[1:27:13.960 --> 1:27:18.080]  out the F and it just makes no sense, but you can see the videos online for yourself
[1:27:18.080 --> 1:27:23.280]  and we're not ABC News or CNN, we're not allowed to play cuss words here, we don't want to either
[1:27:23.280 --> 1:27:26.840]  but we're nationalists, we're Christians, we're patriots, we're conservatives, if we
[1:27:26.840 --> 1:27:32.520]  do we get FCC fines, only Democrats are allowed to cuss on radio and TV and so that means
[1:27:32.520 --> 1:27:36.520]  we can't even show you what's happening out there but it's on infowars.com but just think
[1:27:36.520 --> 1:27:45.840]  about that, he's at the big professional baseball game and they're saying F him, F him till he
[1:27:45.840 --> 1:27:50.200]  has to leave and they just dub over as if everyone didn't already know that that happened,
[1:27:50.200 --> 1:27:54.120]  they don't care, everyone knows it was all over TV, millions saw it, then they put out
[1:27:54.120 --> 1:27:58.560]  a fake tape that he was being cheered, they just aren't giving up, they aren't going away,
[1:27:58.560 --> 1:28:01.880]  I've got an article right here I don't have time to get to, I'll play it tomorrow, where
[1:28:01.880 --> 1:28:07.080]  the head congressional individual over the spending package says we can quote spend whatever
[1:28:07.080 --> 1:28:12.600]  amount of money we want, we're invincible, I mean he actually said we can spend unlimited
[1:28:12.600 --> 1:28:18.720]  amounts is the quote, unlimited amounts is the quote, yeah and then it devalues everything
[1:28:18.720 --> 1:28:22.240]  but see they get the money first while it has value, they buy up real companies and
[1:28:22.240 --> 1:28:27.240]  infrastructure and farms and ranches and weapons and media and then we all get handed the debt
[1:28:27.240 --> 1:28:32.440]  and the inflation and the hell and then they say it's white men that are the problem when
[1:28:32.440 --> 1:28:36.760]  it's just globalist screwing us all, it's totally wild, I mean you're seeing modern
[1:28:36.760 --> 1:28:42.440]  war, the collapse has already begun, it's accelerating, you're in world war three, you're
[1:28:42.440 --> 1:28:46.360]  being hit with bio weapons in the vaccines and then they blame those of us that are smart
[1:28:46.360 --> 1:28:49.200]  and don't take it as the ones that did it and I told you a year and a half ago that
[1:28:49.200 --> 1:28:54.120]  would happen and that would happen, we know what we're talking about, please warn everyone
[1:28:54.120 --> 1:28:58.320]  there isn't much time left, they've already injected half the public, they're already
[1:28:58.320 --> 1:29:00.920]  dying.
[1:29:00.920 --> 1:29:06.240]  My business model is very very simple, I want to bring you products that work really really
[1:29:06.240 --> 1:29:11.480]  well at affordable prices that are competitive so that you'll shop with us and so we form
[1:29:11.480 --> 1:29:17.320]  a relationship so we're able to stay on air and fight the globalist and have good products
[1:29:17.320 --> 1:29:22.080]  that make us healthy, make us wiser, that boost our immune system and that's what we've done.
[1:29:22.080 --> 1:29:26.280]  Now one area of the immune system we don't talk enough about is deep restful sleep, look
[1:29:26.280 --> 1:29:30.480]  it up for yourself, the effects of deep restful sleep on health and the immune system and
[1:29:30.480 --> 1:29:34.200]  so with everything we're doing out there to boost our immune system with vitamin D and
[1:29:34.200 --> 1:29:38.200]  zinc and all of it, that's great but deep restful sleep is just as important, maybe
[1:29:38.200 --> 1:29:44.560]  more important, so infowarstore.com now can announce 50% off on our best selling product

[1:30:02.920 --> 1:30:09.120]  The public leaders of nations across the planet are declaring their allegiance to the New
[1:30:09.120 --> 1:30:14.680]  World Order and Democrat politicians have been announcing it here as well, that means
[1:30:14.680 --> 1:30:20.200]  allegiance to a tyrannical world corporate government established by the Rockefellers
[1:30:20.200 --> 1:30:25.120]  through the UN and they want inside your bodies to put in you what they want, when they want
[1:30:25.120 --> 1:30:31.880]  and to have the global digital tracking COVID passes or vaccine passes to form the backbone
[1:30:31.880 --> 1:30:37.600]  of their New World ID and now their puppet Biden has announced the forced inoculation
[1:30:37.600 --> 1:30:43.200]  of 100 million Americans to keep their jobs in total violation of the Nuremberg Code,
[1:30:43.200 --> 1:30:47.520]  this is criminal and he's lying saying it's an approved vaccine when they did not approve
[1:30:47.520 --> 1:30:52.640]  it, they said that's a 2025 maybe, they just expanded the emergency authorization, that's
[1:30:52.640 --> 1:30:57.360]  why the two top scientists quit a week and a half ago, well you live to see an absolute
[1:30:57.360 --> 1:31:04.840]  new world order world government, if you submit they will totally enslave you.
[1:31:04.840 --> 1:31:10.360]  Jacob in Ohio, welcome go ahead, hey how's it going Alex, great last call, I just wanted
[1:31:10.360 --> 1:31:15.360]  to start with plugging your sleep supplement, it's basically the only way I get sleep anymore
[1:31:15.360 --> 1:31:19.920]  with all the gaslighting, moralization and absurdity, it's like we're living in a twilight
[1:31:19.920 --> 1:31:24.320]  zone and, alright Eric in New Hampshire, Eric thanks for calling go ahead, hey Alex thanks
[1:31:24.320 --> 1:31:28.360]  for taking my call, if I could I just want to throw a quick plug out for the product,
[1:31:28.360 --> 1:31:32.320]  the X team does wonders, they recommend it to everybody, you're on the fence about it,
[1:31:32.320 --> 1:31:35.320]  get off the fence, get the product, support the info board.
[1:31:35.320 --> 1:31:38.960]  Tyler in Maine, you're on the year, thanks for rolling go ahead, hey Alex it's great
[1:31:38.960 --> 1:31:43.600]  to be on with you, it's an honor, honor to talk to you, awesome, so first thing I wanted
[1:31:43.600 --> 1:31:50.000]  to do was say I love the product, alpha power even at 29, if you ask my better half she loves
[1:31:50.000 --> 1:31:54.520]  it and it helps in the bedroom, so just number one for a few years later, well it definitely
[1:31:54.520 --> 1:32:01.840]  works, it's not a joke, absolutely.
[1:32:01.840 --> 1:32:07.720]  So if you understand that this is not FDA approved, it's totally experimental, it's
[1:32:07.720 --> 1:32:15.440]  never been given to human beings before, some of the ingredients inside of these shots have
[1:32:15.440 --> 1:32:21.360]  never been injected in human beings before, there are no long term studies, we don't know
[1:32:21.360 --> 1:32:26.800]  what's going to happen inside your body, somewhere four to six weeks after your second injection
[1:32:26.800 --> 1:32:33.360]  or four to six months or even two years, we have no idea whether it's going to cause
[1:32:33.360 --> 1:32:38.400]  infertility, whether it's going to cause cancer, how bad your autoimmune disease is going
[1:32:38.400 --> 1:32:39.400]  to be.
[1:32:39.400 --> 1:32:42.800]  My conclusion after looking at this for a long time and listening to the arguments
[1:32:42.800 --> 1:32:47.800]  for these masks, I determined that if you believe, if you're a medical doctor or a scientist
[1:32:47.800 --> 1:32:53.120]  that's spouting using these masks, you're either being played or you're being paid.
[1:32:53.120 --> 1:32:58.040]  Secure your copy of Covidland today at covidland.com, if you order by October 6th you get a free
[1:32:58.040 --> 1:33:04.560]  copy of Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[1:33:04.560 --> 1:33:13.160]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:13.160 --> 1:33:21.360]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's
[1:33:21.360 --> 1:33:29.560]  going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got
[1:33:29.560 --> 1:33:30.560]  one.
[1:33:30.560 --> 1:33:51.760]  It's the formation war, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:51.760 --> 1:33:56.000]  Add to that list the vaccination for Covid-19.
[1:33:56.000 --> 1:34:01.720]  California Governor Newsom has done the unthinkable, ignoring the research.
[1:34:01.720 --> 1:34:06.840]  Most if not all of the studies show robust immunity from getting the disease naturally.
[1:34:06.840 --> 1:34:11.400]  The CDC says if you've had measles and have immunity, you don't have to be vaccinated.
[1:34:11.400 --> 1:34:13.440]  The same was true of smallpox.
[1:34:13.440 --> 1:34:17.320]  You're selectively doing this because you want us to submit to your will.
[1:34:17.320 --> 1:34:20.600]  You have no scientific background, no scientific degrees.
[1:34:20.600 --> 1:34:23.640]  I can't go to my doctor and ask my doctor's opinion.
[1:34:23.640 --> 1:34:29.440]  I mean this is incredibly arrogant, combined with this authoritarian nature that you think,
[1:34:29.440 --> 1:34:33.200]  well we'll just tell all of America to do what I say and they better or we'll find them
[1:34:33.200 --> 1:34:36.880]  or put them in jail or not go to school or not let them travel.
[1:34:36.880 --> 1:34:37.880]  Ignoring the deaths.
[1:34:37.880 --> 1:34:43.520]  The CDC finding 16 to 24 year olds who received a Pfizer or Moderna vaccine have experienced
[1:34:43.520 --> 1:34:49.160]  higher than normal cases of myocarditis and inflammation of the heart muscle.
[1:34:49.160 --> 1:34:53.840]  Vaccination in teens explodes across the U.S. after FDA approves injections.
[1:34:53.840 --> 1:34:55.680]  Here's an article out of the U.K. out of the sun.
[1:34:55.680 --> 1:35:00.040]  Side-effect teenage boys are 14 times more likely to suffer heart complications from
[1:35:00.040 --> 1:35:02.200]  Pfizer-Jab study finds.
[1:35:02.200 --> 1:35:08.960]  My son received the vaccine and he died a few days later.
[1:35:08.960 --> 1:35:13.360]  The only explanation that was given to me was in large heart.
[1:35:13.360 --> 1:35:18.760]  I am in the hospital right now with heart complications from the COVID-19 vaccine.
[1:35:18.760 --> 1:35:21.120]  Karen Kingston joined us.
[1:35:21.120 --> 1:35:23.440]  She worked for Pfizer years ago.
[1:35:23.440 --> 1:35:29.880]  She's a biotech analyst and she said if kids become injected she just doesn't know how
[1:35:29.880 --> 1:35:30.880]  they will survive.
[1:35:30.880 --> 1:35:32.200]  Do you agree with that sentiment?
[1:35:32.200 --> 1:35:33.200]  A hundred percent.
[1:35:33.200 --> 1:35:36.600]  I agreed with it before and I agreed with it after.
[1:35:36.600 --> 1:35:41.720]  Now on Tuesday I went for a meeting in London in Westminster in Bird's Cage Walk and we
[1:35:41.720 --> 1:35:45.680]  sat with a very eminent member of parliament who's very influential.
[1:35:45.680 --> 1:35:52.920]  I was surrounded by a plethora of the brightest scientific and legal minds in the world and
[1:35:52.920 --> 1:35:58.600]  they basically said that they foresee in October, November and December a terrible death rate
[1:35:58.600 --> 1:36:04.440]  globally exclusively in the vaccinated.
[1:36:04.440 --> 1:36:06.120]  Children that are injected will die.
[1:36:06.120 --> 1:36:11.040]  One of the main causes of this will be inflammation of the heart and that's been well documented
[1:36:11.040 --> 1:36:17.840]  but totally ignored constantly and those deaths will be labelled swiftly as a new virulent
[1:36:17.840 --> 1:36:21.400]  strain of COVID and they've been very clear on doing that, haven't they?
[1:36:21.400 --> 1:36:26.360]  Every few weeks you get a new strain and there's a new variant and this variant will be the
[1:36:26.360 --> 1:36:29.320]  one that is said to do the most damage.
[1:36:29.320 --> 1:36:34.560]  Now there will be civil unrest as people slowly come to terms with the fact they've been lied
[1:36:34.560 --> 1:36:38.640]  to and nobody loves anything more in their life than their kids, do they?
[1:36:38.640 --> 1:36:39.640]  Let's be honest.
[1:36:39.640 --> 1:36:44.000]  We're hearing the doctors and parents that will rise up like a firestorm in the next
[1:36:44.000 --> 1:36:46.080]  few days, weeks and months.
[1:36:46.080 --> 1:36:50.000]  We're just not going to follow in line with just a mandate.
[1:36:50.000 --> 1:36:54.760]  We want to go through a process and we want to be in the driver's seat on the decisions
[1:36:54.760 --> 1:36:55.760]  for our children.
[1:36:55.760 --> 1:37:01.880]  Newsom has mandated that public school children, kindergarten through 12th grade, must receive
[1:37:01.880 --> 1:37:04.920]  the ineffective and dangerous COVID vaccine.
[1:37:04.920 --> 1:37:11.800]  So once the FDA approves the vaccination in different cohorts, starting with 12 and above,
[1:37:11.800 --> 1:37:20.000]  grade 7 to 12, we will begin to apply that requirement in the next term, either January
[1:37:20.000 --> 1:37:25.240]  1st or July 1st, whichever comes sooner.
[1:37:25.240 --> 1:37:30.520]  Newsom has said in motion a decree that will make disgraced Governor Cuomo's nursing home
[1:37:30.520 --> 1:37:33.320]  massacre look like a blip on the radar.
[1:37:33.320 --> 1:37:39.000]  Agnes, Minnesota died at age 93 in an Albany hospital just a couple days after her nursing
[1:37:39.000 --> 1:37:40.320]  home center there.
[1:37:40.320 --> 1:37:46.040]  Her son, a registered Democrat, same party as Cuomo says, this isn't about politics.
[1:37:46.040 --> 1:37:49.640]  I think there was an intentional cover up because of the numbers.
[1:37:49.640 --> 1:37:55.200]  You know, he's bragging about the numbers in nursing homes and, you know, and he wanted
[1:37:55.200 --> 1:37:56.600]  to lower the numbers.
[1:37:56.600 --> 1:37:59.960]  And I know what he's playing with here and it's just not right.
[1:37:59.960 --> 1:38:01.240]  I want the truth.
[1:38:01.240 --> 1:38:09.240]  I want justice, affecting 6.7 million children currently 7th to 12th graders will have until
[1:38:09.240 --> 1:38:15.720]  next summer to get their vaccinations, while kindergartners through 6th graders are merely
[1:38:15.720 --> 1:38:19.600]  waiting on Fauci to get the approval for that age group.
[1:38:19.600 --> 1:38:24.120]  We're talking at a matter of weeks, possibly by the end of the month, the beginning of
[1:38:24.120 --> 1:38:28.840]  next month, because I know the FDA really wants to do it correctly, but they want to
[1:38:28.840 --> 1:38:30.240]  do it quickly.
[1:38:30.240 --> 1:38:36.040]  Many states will follow Newsom's moronic lead as they did when he began the first stay-at-home
[1:38:36.040 --> 1:38:37.040]  orders.
[1:38:37.040 --> 1:38:42.720]  And there's a recognition of our interdependence that requires of this moment that we direct
[1:38:42.720 --> 1:38:46.720]  a statewide order for people to stay at home.
[1:38:46.720 --> 1:38:54.240]  Leading America into tyranny and doom, John Bown reporting.
[1:38:54.240 --> 1:38:59.720]  The latest by John Bown, you can find it now at band.videoandinfowars.com, I suggest you
[1:38:59.720 --> 1:39:00.720]  go and share it.
[1:39:00.720 --> 1:39:01.720]  Click the share button.
[1:39:01.720 --> 1:39:06.440]  It'll give you a disguise to URL, which means you can publish it on Big Tech, despite their
[1:39:06.440 --> 1:39:12.600]  ongoing and indeed increasing censorship campaigns, band.video, then just hit the share button.
[1:39:12.600 --> 1:39:14.100]  And welcome back.
[1:39:14.100 --> 1:39:15.100]  My name is Harrison Smith.
[1:39:15.100 --> 1:39:16.760]  I'm sitting in here for Alex Jones.
[1:39:16.760 --> 1:39:21.040]  I'll be here well into the evening, but we have some very special videos to show you,
[1:39:21.040 --> 1:39:26.240]  some exclusive interviews to get to, and of course, Alex didn't get to it, but I will
[1:39:26.240 --> 1:39:31.080]  be showing this video and covering this story that, again, it's just that they just keep
[1:39:31.080 --> 1:39:33.960]  pushing and they just keep pushing and they just keep pushing it.
[1:39:33.960 --> 1:39:38.880]  And at a certain point, it seems like it's parody, but it's not, because it's really
[1:39:38.880 --> 1:39:39.880]  not funny.
[1:39:39.880 --> 1:39:40.880]  It's your future they're talking about.
[1:39:40.880 --> 1:39:44.320]  Of course, I'm talking about the House Budget Committee Chairman saying the federal government
[1:39:44.320 --> 1:39:47.200]  can afford anything, anything at all.
[1:39:47.200 --> 1:39:52.360]  He's like, you fools that think we're bounded by logic and common sense.
[1:39:52.360 --> 1:39:57.520]  No, we can do whatever we want, because we have the guns and the power to do it.
[1:39:57.520 --> 1:39:58.520]  Really incredible stuff.
[1:39:58.520 --> 1:39:59.800]  A lot of incredible stuff to talk about.
[1:39:59.800 --> 1:40:03.520]  And I'm going to try to do a weekend review, and I say I'm going to try to do a weekend
[1:40:03.520 --> 1:40:07.280]  review, because if you ever watch American Journal, the show that I host in the morning,
[1:40:07.280 --> 1:40:10.480]  I always do a daily dispatch, and I always talk about how I try, I'm going to try to
[1:40:10.480 --> 1:40:15.760]  keep it as short as possible, but with just the sheer volume of news we deal with on a
[1:40:15.760 --> 1:40:16.760]  daily basis.
[1:40:16.760 --> 1:40:20.640]  It always stretches to like two or three segments, and that's just for a single day.
[1:40:20.640 --> 1:40:25.600]  So I thought I'd go through and just grab the top stories that really illustrate where
[1:40:25.600 --> 1:40:32.800]  we are as a civilization, and where the information war stands, and five pages of links.
[1:40:32.800 --> 1:40:37.880]  Five pages of links, like a link, like one line on a document, five pages of those for
[1:40:37.880 --> 1:40:38.880]  a single week.
[1:40:38.880 --> 1:40:42.240]  So will I be able to get to any of them, or all of them?
[1:40:42.240 --> 1:40:46.160]  Stay tuned and find out, because really that's the best way to understand what's going
[1:40:46.160 --> 1:40:51.000]  on in this world, is not take things just one at a time where it's forgotten the very
[1:40:51.000 --> 1:40:56.800]  next day, but to look back and see the totality of what is occurring at this point in time,
[1:40:56.800 --> 1:41:01.440]  and what has happened over the last week, and boy oh boy, is it a cavalcade of absurdity.
[1:41:01.440 --> 1:41:03.280]  I think that's a good way to describe it.
[1:41:03.280 --> 1:41:09.440]  In fact, Alex was telling you about the black woman masquerading as a Ku Klux Klan member,
[1:41:09.440 --> 1:41:11.280]  terrorizing neighbors and facing charges.
[1:41:11.280 --> 1:41:17.360]  That was just one of three fake hate crime hoaxes that were either perpetrated or uncovered
[1:41:17.360 --> 1:41:20.720]  this week, three in a single week.
[1:41:20.720 --> 1:41:22.520]  Amazing, isn't it?
[1:41:22.520 --> 1:41:23.520]  Amazing.
[1:41:23.520 --> 1:41:26.440]  You'd think there wouldn't have to be any hate hoaxes with the amount we hear about
[1:41:26.440 --> 1:41:31.880]  white supremacist terror, domestic terror on a daily basis, but seems like the demand
[1:41:31.880 --> 1:41:39.800]  for hate crimes outstrips the supply, so they're false flagging us into division, desperation,
[1:41:39.800 --> 1:41:40.800]  and chaos.
[1:41:40.800 --> 1:41:41.800]  All of that and more.
[1:41:41.800 --> 1:41:47.360]  I do want to remind you, everything we do here is funded by InfowarsStore.com, and this
[1:41:47.360 --> 1:41:54.240]  weekend personally was kind of a white-pilling weekend for me, an uplifting weekend for me.
[1:41:54.240 --> 1:41:59.440]  I was at a wedding yesterday evening and they tell you where to sit, so we go find our nametags
[1:41:59.440 --> 1:42:01.440]  and sit down and sitting right next to me.
[1:42:01.440 --> 1:42:07.960]  There's a young man, very respectable-looking young man, he's reading a book titled The
[1:42:07.960 --> 1:42:12.960]  Pearl Harbor Conspiracy, and so of course my wife and I sort of laughed at that and
[1:42:12.960 --> 1:42:16.480]  his parents were like, oh yeah, he's really into that sort of stuff, and I'm like, it's
[1:42:16.480 --> 1:42:17.480]  fine.
[1:42:17.480 --> 1:42:22.440]  We're going to have a very good conversation for this wedding, and then it's his mom's
[1:42:22.440 --> 1:42:26.920]  like, yeah, you know, I kind of get embarrassed because he's always going around telling people
[1:42:26.920 --> 1:42:27.920]  like, total strangers.
[1:42:27.920 --> 1:42:30.920]  I'll just go up to him and tell him like, the government's trying to control you, and
[1:42:30.920 --> 1:42:36.120]  they're out to destroy you, and I'm like, this kid's going places, this is the future,
[1:42:36.120 --> 1:42:39.520]  so don't lose hope, folks.
[1:42:39.520 --> 1:42:41.120]  Don't think it's all hopeless.
[1:42:41.120 --> 1:42:45.960]  The young are waking up, and the more the globalist push, the more the pushback happens,
[1:42:45.960 --> 1:42:49.960]  and the more the young people are opening up their eyes and really pushing back against
[1:42:49.960 --> 1:42:50.960]  this.
[1:42:50.960 --> 1:42:55.360]  That's just one of a couple stories that I have that shows the Info Wars progressing
[1:42:55.360 --> 1:42:58.120]  rather well despite everything that they throw at us.
[1:42:58.120 --> 1:43:01.120]  More of that on the other side, stay with us.
[1:43:01.120 --> 1:43:05.380]  And in addition, we were really finding that we were stressing the cardiopulmonary systems
[1:43:05.380 --> 1:43:09.680]  of these employees because when you cover the mouth and nose and you exert physical
[1:43:09.680 --> 1:43:14.680]  energy during your work, during your tasks, whatever it might be, you're really stressing
[1:43:14.680 --> 1:43:17.800]  the cardiopulmonary system because you change the way that you breathe.
[1:43:17.800 --> 1:43:21.160]  You have to forcibly inhale and forcibly exhale.
[1:43:21.160 --> 1:43:22.680]  That taxes the heart.
[1:43:22.680 --> 1:43:24.120]  It taxes the lungs.
[1:43:24.120 --> 1:43:28.600]  And we have given people heart attacks by allowing them to work with their mouth and
[1:43:28.600 --> 1:43:35.400]  nose covered with absolutely no regulation, no oversight, no medical oversight.
[1:43:35.400 --> 1:43:37.600]  The globalists have told us we're a disease.
[1:43:37.600 --> 1:43:39.520]  They've told us they want to eradicate us.
[1:43:39.520 --> 1:43:43.400]  And all the studies show that when you wear these masks, it lowers your oxygen level up
[1:43:43.400 --> 1:43:48.480]  to one third and gives you dangerous levels of carbon dioxide poisoning.
[1:43:48.480 --> 1:43:50.840]  This is a sick cult, and we've got to say no.
[1:43:50.840 --> 1:43:55.280]  But the only way the real science comes out of the public is if we tell them, get your
[1:43:55.280 --> 1:43:58.280]  copy today of COVIDland and expose them.
[1:43:58.280 --> 1:43:59.280]  It's COVIDland.com.
[1:43:59.280 --> 1:44:00.280]  Go there now.
[1:44:00.280 --> 1:44:05.320]  By now, you've heard me talk about the BioProse and how they're creating amazing products.
[1:44:05.320 --> 1:44:10.920]  They've done it again and have just released an entire suite of bio-remediation products
[1:44:10.920 --> 1:44:14.280]  bringing industrial level technology to the everyday consumer.
[1:44:14.280 --> 1:44:18.400]  They're literally changing the industry with a revolutionary patented delivery system.
[1:44:18.400 --> 1:44:24.160]  The BioProse are excited to release BioDrain Pro, a product specifically designed to establish
[1:44:24.160 --> 1:44:27.280]  healthy drains, pipes, and overall plumbing systems.
[1:44:27.280 --> 1:44:33.760]  BioDrain Pro digests grease, fats, oil, sludge, paper, and organic matter with ease.
[1:44:33.760 --> 1:44:40.200]  It contains no chemicals, no GMOs, and is safe for black-gray holding tanks, sewer hoses,
[1:44:40.200 --> 1:44:41.200]  and plumbing.
[1:44:41.200 --> 1:44:43.080]  It is also human and animal safe.
[1:44:43.080 --> 1:44:47.280]  Get up to 20 treatments with the scoop for easy applications.
[1:44:47.280 --> 1:44:52.720]  Say goodbye to drain problems, gas buildup, and odor, guaranteed.
[1:44:52.720 --> 1:44:53.720]  Just pour and add water.
[1:44:53.720 --> 1:44:54.720]  It's that simple.
[1:44:54.720 --> 1:45:00.960]  Visit thebioprose.com and see for yourself.
[1:45:00.960 --> 1:45:06.440]  The purpose of fear is to call us into action, and there is plenty to be afraid of today.
[1:45:06.440 --> 1:45:12.160]  Half the population has lined up for an untested, deadly, and debilitating experimental injection
[1:45:12.160 --> 1:45:16.360]  because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease.
[1:45:16.360 --> 1:45:21.440]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80% of the population
[1:45:21.440 --> 1:45:26.280]  hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years.
[1:45:26.280 --> 1:45:30.560]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell, we know this is all really happening, and
[1:45:30.560 --> 1:45:33.080]  it's unbelievably unsettling to see.
[1:45:33.080 --> 1:45:35.600]  But there is only two things to do.
[1:45:35.600 --> 1:45:38.720]  We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[1:45:38.720 --> 1:45:42.080]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win.
[1:45:42.080 --> 1:45:46.720]  But even when we win, and we eventually will, the days of convenience are soon coming to
[1:45:46.720 --> 1:45:47.720]  an end.
[1:45:47.720 --> 1:45:53.680]  So we must prepare, get up to a year's worth of storable foods, water filtration, survival
[1:45:53.680 --> 1:46:00.360]  gear, seeds, shortwave radios, and life-saving knowledge at infoorstore.com.
[1:46:00.360 --> 1:46:02.120]  I got some good news.
[1:46:02.120 --> 1:46:08.320]  All the items in front of me are back in stock and are 40 to 50% off at infoorstore.com.
[1:46:08.320 --> 1:46:11.680]  The bad news is, a lot of them are about to sell out.
[1:46:11.680 --> 1:46:15.720]  So this sale is only going from one week starting on September 29th, and in the case
[1:46:15.720 --> 1:46:21.760]  of green fiber capsules, these will be sold out in just a couple of days, 50% off.
[1:46:21.760 --> 1:46:24.160]  We have knockout sleep aid, 50% off.
[1:46:24.160 --> 1:46:28.280]  Sold out for months, very popular, twice as strong as knockout, probably too strong for
[1:46:28.280 --> 1:46:29.280]  some people.
[1:46:29.280 --> 1:46:30.840]  Totally different formula.
[1:46:30.840 --> 1:46:33.440]  Down and out is back in stock, 50% off.
[1:46:33.440 --> 1:46:38.200]  We've extended the sale on Winter Sun and Ultra 12, 50% off, and also on Deep Earth
[1:46:38.200 --> 1:46:40.480]  Crystal iodine, Survival Shell X2.
[1:46:40.480 --> 1:46:44.000]  It's all 40, and 50% off for one week only.
[1:46:44.000 --> 1:46:48.720]  Take advantage of it and fund the info war, and I thank you all for your support, infowarstore.com
[1:46:48.720 --> 1:46:52.600]  or triple eight, two five three, three one three nine.
[1:46:52.600 --> 1:46:53.600]  It's a win-win.
[1:46:53.600 --> 1:46:57.640]  These are things that make you healthy, make your life better, and they fund the info war.
[1:46:57.640 --> 1:47:04.520]  Again, all we lose is if you don't take action right now.
[1:47:04.520 --> 1:47:15.040]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:15.040 --> 1:47:29.000]  All right, welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:47:29.000 --> 1:47:31.080]  Sunday Night Live, my name's Harrison Smith.
[1:47:31.080 --> 1:47:36.160]  I'm the morning host here at Info Wars, and I ask you to start your morning with Info
[1:47:36.160 --> 1:47:41.280]  Wars, American Journal, every day, 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. Central Standard Time, infowars.com.
[1:47:41.280 --> 1:47:45.920]  Of course, this is where you go to stream that, and I hope you tune in.
[1:47:45.920 --> 1:47:51.200]  I'm going to do a little week in review starting at 6 p.m., but for now we have a lot of other
[1:47:51.200 --> 1:47:57.120]  stories to talk about, and interestingly, in my week in review, I have an image or a
[1:47:57.120 --> 1:48:00.440]  screenshot of a headline, but I wanted to go find the link.
[1:48:00.440 --> 1:48:04.480]  And of course, this is one of the three hate crime hoaxes that were uncovered this weekend,
[1:48:04.480 --> 1:48:05.480]  this in particular one.
[1:48:05.480 --> 1:48:09.440]  I was looking for an article called, from the college fix, called Black Man Arrested
[1:48:09.440 --> 1:48:13.320]  for Inward Graffiti Swastikas at Emory University.
[1:48:13.320 --> 1:48:18.800]  This, of course, is one of the three, and I couldn't find it on Google, just wouldn't
[1:48:18.800 --> 1:48:19.800]  come up.
[1:48:19.800 --> 1:48:24.560]  I had to type the entire headline, plus the name of the article, all into Google, and then
[1:48:24.560 --> 1:48:27.040]  hit the news tab for it to bring it up for me.
[1:48:27.040 --> 1:48:29.600]  You just got to wonder, how smart are these algorithms?
[1:48:29.600 --> 1:48:35.720]  Where are people going in on an individual basis deleting these types of articles?
[1:48:35.720 --> 1:48:36.720]  It's just amazing.
[1:48:36.720 --> 1:48:41.920]  And you would think that if, in a perfect world, in a world full of people with intelligence
[1:48:41.920 --> 1:48:47.240]  and can think for themselves and can just see for themselves what's going on, info wars
[1:48:47.240 --> 1:48:48.360]  wouldn't have to be here.
[1:48:48.360 --> 1:48:53.160]  We wouldn't be necessary, because everything that these people are engaged in, the globalist,
[1:48:53.160 --> 1:48:57.000]  the Bilderberg group, the Davos group, World Economic Forum, it's so obvious.
[1:48:57.000 --> 1:48:58.640]  I mean, it's in your face.
[1:48:58.640 --> 1:49:01.720]  We shouldn't have to get up here and tell you about it.
[1:49:01.720 --> 1:49:03.880]  But my God, is this necessary?
[1:49:03.880 --> 1:49:07.120]  It's like the most important thing we could possibly be doing right now, because, I don't
[1:49:07.120 --> 1:49:08.440]  know, people just don't seem to get it.
[1:49:08.440 --> 1:49:12.440]  They just don't seem to be able to figure this stuff out for themselves.
[1:49:12.440 --> 1:49:16.000]  And so, of course, we know that the globalists are, you know, they're machinations and they're
[1:49:16.000 --> 1:49:20.240]  plans and their schemes are on a level that they've never reached before.
[1:49:20.240 --> 1:49:26.600]  And everything from just the sheer force by which they're trying to put these things
[1:49:26.600 --> 1:49:30.680]  in place to just the breadth and scale of everything that they're trying to bring about
[1:49:30.680 --> 1:49:34.840]  all at once from the border to the vaccine mandates, all that sort of stuff, it's, I
[1:49:34.840 --> 1:49:36.520]  mean, this is it, right?
[1:49:36.520 --> 1:49:38.200]  They're putting everything on the table.
[1:49:38.200 --> 1:49:40.200]  They're all in.
[1:49:40.200 --> 1:49:47.920]  And that's certainly a source of anxiety and aggravation for people here who don't want
[1:49:47.920 --> 1:49:50.440]  to be slaves of Klaus Schwab.
[1:49:50.440 --> 1:49:55.920]  But on the other hand, on the other hand, it's worth it to stop for a moment and think
[1:49:55.920 --> 1:49:58.360]  about how far the Info War has come.
[1:49:58.360 --> 1:50:03.880]  Think about the fact that now millions of people on Twitter talk about this stuff every
[1:50:03.880 --> 1:50:04.880]  single day.
[1:50:04.880 --> 1:50:08.480]  It used to be 10 years ago, if you wanted to talk about the Bilderberg group or Davos
[1:50:08.480 --> 1:50:13.600]  or this sort of stuff, you had to go to some forum somewhere, you know, with like a dozen
[1:50:13.600 --> 1:50:15.720]  people all sort of talking about this stuff.
[1:50:15.720 --> 1:50:19.720]  And, you know, none of it was widespread or talked about a lot.
[1:50:19.720 --> 1:50:23.800]  Like it was in the dark, deep dark corners of the, you know, not respectable Internet.
[1:50:23.800 --> 1:50:24.800]  It was over there.
[1:50:24.800 --> 1:50:26.920]  Of course, they'd love to return to that.
[1:50:26.920 --> 1:50:32.160]  But how different is it now that you can make a tweet talking about Bilderberg or Davos,
[1:50:32.160 --> 1:50:35.320]  10,000 likes, right, to get shared over and over again.
[1:50:35.320 --> 1:50:40.560]  It's amazing how far the Info War has come and it's really impressive.
[1:50:40.560 --> 1:50:43.840]  And of course, then you, I get into the, the what ifs.
[1:50:43.840 --> 1:50:50.040]  That's like, man, what if, what if Alex Jones got like the Dr. Fauci treatment in like 2001?
[1:50:50.040 --> 1:50:54.880]  What if instead of in 2001, you know, everybody denigrating and telling Alex Jones he was
[1:50:54.880 --> 1:51:01.680]  a crazy conspiracy theorist for thinking that the Patriot Act would impinge on our liberties?
[1:51:01.680 --> 1:51:06.600]  What if instead he was like put on Oprah and then like interviewed him on CNN and actually
[1:51:06.600 --> 1:51:11.040]  gave credence and consideration to the things that he was saying?
[1:51:11.040 --> 1:51:14.000]  And what if this awakening had started 20 years ago?
[1:51:14.000 --> 1:51:17.160]  What if we avoided going into war in Afghanistan and Iraq?
[1:51:17.160 --> 1:51:22.240]  What if we avoided all of these civil liberties that we've lost because of the Patriot Act?
[1:51:22.240 --> 1:51:26.960]  What if, right, would be a very different world today?
[1:51:26.960 --> 1:51:30.080]  And I think that's a world that we can look forward to because I really do think that
[1:51:30.080 --> 1:51:34.200]  Info Wars is making a massive difference, waking just an infinite number of people up.
[1:51:34.200 --> 1:51:35.840]  It's really incredible to see.
[1:51:35.840 --> 1:51:39.080]  And every day we're making major strides, which is why they're attacking us so much.
[1:51:39.080 --> 1:51:42.920]  And so I guess all this is to say, we wouldn't be here without you.
[1:51:42.920 --> 1:51:46.440]  And of course, as much as Info Wars does, we'd be shouting to the trees if it weren't
[1:51:46.440 --> 1:51:50.040]  for the audience out there helping to share this message, spread this message, spread
[1:51:50.040 --> 1:51:51.040]  the links.
[1:51:51.040 --> 1:51:52.720]  And of course, go to infowarstore.com.
[1:51:52.720 --> 1:51:56.000]  We have no other support other than you.
[1:51:56.000 --> 1:51:59.520]  So thank you so much sincerely for supporting us and getting this word out here and helping
[1:51:59.520 --> 1:52:08.000]  to actually make a major change, a shift in the course of humanity itself by waking up
[1:52:08.000 --> 1:52:12.960]  to the machinations of the globalists and actually standing up and resisting it.
[1:52:12.960 --> 1:52:16.920]  Very, very honored to be a part of this and very thankful to everybody who goes to Info
[1:52:16.920 --> 1:52:22.520]  Wars Store and allows us to carry out this literal information war that we are now engaged
[1:52:22.520 --> 1:52:23.520]  in.
[1:52:23.520 --> 1:52:27.560]  I want to go to this video that Alex talked about a little bit earlier.
[1:52:27.560 --> 1:52:31.680]  The article from Gateway Pundit says, House Budget Committee Chairman says, federal government
[1:52:31.680 --> 1:52:36.600]  can afford anything, anything at all.
[1:52:36.600 --> 1:52:39.120]  I haven't seen this yet, so I'll comment on the other side.
[1:52:39.120 --> 1:52:46.600]  Let's now go to this video of John Yarmuth, the House Budget Committee Chairman, lying
[1:52:46.600 --> 1:52:49.560]  to you about what the federal government can afford.
[1:52:49.560 --> 1:52:51.440]  I read Joe Manchin's statement.
[1:52:51.440 --> 1:52:52.560]  I've listened to him.
[1:52:52.560 --> 1:52:59.040]  He has no understanding of how the federal government monetary system works.
[1:52:59.040 --> 1:53:04.240]  When he compared it yesterday to his household income, that has no relevance to what we can
[1:53:04.240 --> 1:53:05.240]  do.
[1:53:05.240 --> 1:53:07.040]  It's not a question of what we can afford.
[1:53:07.040 --> 1:53:12.080]  The federal government can afford anything that it feels it needs to do.
[1:53:12.080 --> 1:53:14.000]  Right now, that's what we ought to be focused on.
[1:53:14.000 --> 1:53:18.000]  You can see even the CNN reporter looked up at that.
[1:53:18.000 --> 1:53:21.320]  In the Budget Committee, that's the position I will take going forward.
[1:53:21.320 --> 1:53:29.160]  Frankly, I think it's respectable of the man to wear the grade he got in civics on the
[1:53:29.160 --> 1:53:30.560]  front of his jacket.
[1:53:30.560 --> 1:53:32.960]  I think that's a respectable thing.
[1:53:32.960 --> 1:53:38.960]  You want to see the letter grade that he earned there on the lapel in civics class, or perhaps
[1:53:38.960 --> 1:53:39.960]  economics.
[1:53:39.960 --> 1:53:45.640]  Here's the dirty little truth that everybody knows, the federal government has no money
[1:53:45.640 --> 1:53:46.640]  at all.
[1:53:46.640 --> 1:53:47.960]  The federal government doesn't have a dime.
[1:53:47.960 --> 1:53:52.320]  The only money that the federal government actually makes for itself, the money it generates
[1:53:52.320 --> 1:53:57.480]  is when it sells missiles to Iran or drugs to the inner city.
[1:53:57.480 --> 1:53:58.840]  That's how the government makes money.
[1:53:58.840 --> 1:54:04.720]  If it's deep state operatives creating a slush fund to carry out their black ops in third
[1:54:04.720 --> 1:54:06.600]  world countries, that's their money.
[1:54:06.600 --> 1:54:08.760]  They've earned that, I think.
[1:54:08.760 --> 1:54:10.360]  Everything else, it's not their money.
[1:54:10.360 --> 1:54:12.440]  It's a credit card with your child's name on it.
[1:54:12.440 --> 1:54:15.120]  It's a credit card with your grandchildren's name on it.
[1:54:15.120 --> 1:54:16.120]  They don't own anything.
[1:54:16.120 --> 1:54:19.560]  They don't have anything except for what they can squeeze from you.
[1:54:19.560 --> 1:54:25.720]  That seems like their primary or perhaps exclusive concern at this point as we continue on to
[1:54:25.720 --> 1:54:32.960]  hear all these discussions about the $3.5 trillion bill, I'm sorry, the $0 dollar bill
[1:54:32.960 --> 1:54:38.160]  if you listen to the Democrats, it's absurd, but there's always this, the government's
[1:54:38.160 --> 1:54:39.640]  going to run out of money.
[1:54:39.640 --> 1:54:40.640]  Government has no money.
[1:54:40.640 --> 1:54:41.640]  It has your money.
[1:54:41.640 --> 1:54:45.600]  It has what it can squeeze from you.
[1:54:45.600 --> 1:54:49.520]  Just amazing that they would say that, and of course it reflects the attitude that they
[1:54:49.520 --> 1:54:50.520]  all have.
[1:54:50.520 --> 1:54:51.720]  We can do whatever we want.
[1:54:51.720 --> 1:54:57.480]  We can demand whatever we desire, and we can steal it from whoever we want because we're
[1:54:57.480 --> 1:54:59.720]  the federal government, after all.
[1:54:59.720 --> 1:55:03.480]  It's amazing, this mindset that they have.
[1:55:03.480 --> 1:55:06.680]  I mean, so many statements these days are just baffling.
[1:55:06.680 --> 1:55:11.540]  I mean, you saw in that video, even the CNN reporter, when he's like, money's not an issue.
[1:55:11.540 --> 1:55:13.400]  Federal government can afford anything we want.
[1:55:13.400 --> 1:55:18.280]  She's like, okay, she's not going to say anything, obviously, it's CNN.
[1:55:18.280 --> 1:55:23.800]  They believe that, but it's like, wow, that's just on its face, an insane thing to say and
[1:55:23.800 --> 1:55:25.360]  an insane thing to think.
[1:55:25.360 --> 1:55:30.040]  But that's what they believe, and they're convincing you of it too, I guess.
[1:55:30.040 --> 1:55:36.000]  And it's amazing, I saw a statement from Bernie Sanders, because obviously I don't think I
[1:55:36.000 --> 1:55:37.000]  need to tell you folks.
[1:55:37.000 --> 1:55:38.000]  This is socialism.
[1:55:38.000 --> 1:55:39.000]  This is communism.
[1:55:39.000 --> 1:55:41.240]  This is what they're setting up, and it's what we can expect.
[1:55:41.240 --> 1:55:47.800]  And he says, it's a shame that two senators can stand in the way when there are 48 senators
[1:55:47.800 --> 1:55:54.160]  who want this, completely disregarding 50% of the Senate, right?
[1:55:54.160 --> 1:55:59.800]  Completely disregarding the 50 people that are Republicans that are against this.
[1:55:59.800 --> 1:56:01.760]  So this is the mindset of these people, right?
[1:56:01.760 --> 1:56:05.440]  This is the mindset of the democratic socialists is like, well, socialism is fine, as long
[1:56:05.440 --> 1:56:06.800]  as the majority is for it.
[1:56:06.800 --> 1:56:11.280]  As long as 50% or more people agree with this, then it's the right thing to do, because that's
[1:56:11.280 --> 1:56:12.280]  the majority.
[1:56:12.280 --> 1:56:14.520]  And if they want socialism, then that's what they're going to get.
[1:56:14.520 --> 1:56:21.600]  That's democratic socialism, except 52% of the representatives don't want it, 48% do.
[1:56:21.600 --> 1:56:25.000]  So that means we don't, we're not going to have it, right?
[1:56:25.000 --> 1:56:26.960]  Because that's what democratic socialism is all about.
[1:56:26.960 --> 1:56:30.720]  It's well, it's whatever the majority wants, well, in this case, the majority doesn't want
[1:56:30.720 --> 1:56:36.760]  your endless debt and your giveaways to foreign countries and your giveaways to everybody else
[1:56:36.760 --> 1:56:37.760]  in this country.
[1:56:37.760 --> 1:56:44.480]  Two senators cannot be allowed to defeat what 48 senators and 200 House members want.
[1:56:44.480 --> 1:56:46.920]  Like it's just, it's just a glimpse into their mindset.
[1:56:46.920 --> 1:56:47.920]  Isn't it?
[1:56:47.920 --> 1:56:48.920]  It's you don't exist.
[1:56:48.920 --> 1:56:51.520]  Your representatives do not exist.
[1:56:51.520 --> 1:56:55.920]  It's just amazing, 52% don't want this.
[1:56:55.920 --> 1:57:02.000]  So under your own, no, no, I'm not going to call them a hypocrite because why would I?
[1:57:02.000 --> 1:57:03.000]  They don't care.
[1:57:03.000 --> 1:57:04.000]  They really don't care.
[1:57:04.000 --> 1:57:05.000]  They're not even hypocrites.
[1:57:05.000 --> 1:57:07.760]  They're just power hungry psychopaths.
[1:57:07.760 --> 1:57:11.480]  And that's, and that's what we're doing here.
[1:57:11.480 --> 1:57:16.840]  There's so much, I mean, even just today, like forget this, this last week, just today,
[1:57:16.840 --> 1:57:21.960]  J&J vaccine could be linked to another clotting condition according to the EU, rare blood
[1:57:21.960 --> 1:57:22.960]  clotting in deep veins.
[1:57:22.960 --> 1:57:25.120]  My God, we are almost out of time on this segment.
[1:57:25.120 --> 1:57:26.120]  Hey, time flies.
[1:57:26.120 --> 1:57:27.120]  You're having fun.
[1:57:27.120 --> 1:57:32.040]  I'll be here on the other side of this commercial break to break down the whole week of absurd
[1:57:32.040 --> 1:57:37.040]  insanity, of cacophonous madness that we experience when we read the headlines here.
[1:57:37.040 --> 1:57:38.560]  Go to infowarstore.com.
[1:57:38.560 --> 1:57:39.560]  Please do support us.
[1:57:39.560 --> 1:57:40.560]  You know we're under attack.
[1:57:40.560 --> 1:57:43.080]  We know they want us gone.
[1:57:43.080 --> 1:57:44.080]  Just don't let them win.
[1:57:44.080 --> 1:57:45.080]  Just don't let them win.
[1:57:45.080 --> 1:57:48.400]  Just, you know what, if you want the globalist to win, don't go to infowarstore.
[1:57:48.400 --> 1:57:50.680]  But please, for the love of God and humanity, please.
[1:57:50.680 --> 1:57:55.720]  We here at InfoWars are proud to announce the first ever Kava Kava root supplement that
[1:57:55.720 --> 1:57:59.320]  is now available at infowarstore.com.
[1:57:59.320 --> 1:58:03.560]  Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in the natural health world today, though it
[1:58:03.560 --> 1:58:08.720]  has been used for hundreds of years in the Pacific Islands for its relaxation and euphoric
[1:58:08.720 --> 1:58:09.960]  effects.
[1:58:09.960 --> 1:58:15.320]  According to ancient Samoan legend, Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa,
[1:58:15.320 --> 1:58:19.680]  who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe.
[1:58:19.680 --> 1:58:24.360]  The Samoan people would drink Kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to
[1:58:24.360 --> 1:58:25.680]  loosen up a little.
[1:58:25.680 --> 1:58:30.480]  Nowadays, Kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[1:58:30.480 --> 1:58:36.480]  The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only Kava Kava, but other
[1:58:36.480 --> 1:58:39.360]  herbs including but not limited to.
[1:58:39.360 --> 1:58:43.200]  And Kava Milk, Organic Skull Cap, and Balerian root.
[1:58:43.200 --> 1:58:51.240]  We do expect to sell this new product quickly, so be sure to secure yours by visiting infowarstore.com.
[1:58:51.240 --> 1:58:55.920]  The average person on the face of this incredible planet is still unaware that there's a war
[1:58:55.920 --> 1:59:01.240]  between free individuals and nation states on one side and the globalist on the other
[1:59:01.240 --> 1:59:05.120]  who are literally trying to create a post-human world.
[1:59:05.120 --> 1:59:09.320]  For the United States to Brazil, and of course triggered by the Brexit in the UK, nations
[1:59:09.320 --> 1:59:12.960]  were pulling out of the private corporate fascist world government.
[1:59:12.960 --> 1:59:18.400]  That's why they launched their great recess and their program after collapsing us of Build
[1:59:18.400 --> 1:59:20.200]  Back Better.
