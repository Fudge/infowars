[00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:01.009]  Dead on.
[00:00:01.009 --> 00:00:05.511]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[00:00:05.511 --> 00:00:07.052]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[00:00:07.052 --> 00:00:11.614]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.

[00:00:13.514 --> 00:00:17.436]  Sold in the largest leveraged buyout in history.
[00:00:17.436 --> 00:00:18.356]  Thank you for listening to GCA.
[00:00:31.147 --> 00:00:37.856]  BLBJ in Austin.
[00:00:37.856 --> 00:00:41.101]  USA Radio Network News, Richard Curtis reporting.
[00:00:41.101 --> 00:00:47.189]  Tornadoes have ripped through Arkansas, including one that cut a five-mile swath through the heart of the community of Dumas.
[00:00:48.442 --> 00:00:54.188]  Tina Owens with the State Department of Emergency Management says looters moved in as soon as the tornadoes moved out.
[00:00:54.188 --> 00:01:00.334]  One of the buildings that was hit was a Fred's Dollar Store and we understand that there has been some looting in that area.
[00:01:00.334 --> 00:01:03.057]  At least 27 people were hurt by the strong winds.
[00:01:03.057 --> 00:01:04.979]  Three of those are in critical condition.
[00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.423]  Crews are also looking for an unknown number of people who may still be missing.
[00:01:09.272 --> 00:01:21.085]  The permanent five members of the UN Security Council plus Germany will be in London Monday to talk about whether to increase sanctions on Iran following its failure to meet the February 21st deadline to end its enrichment of uranium.
[00:01:21.085 --> 00:01:22.787]  Vice President Dick Cheney says the U.S.
[00:01:22.787 --> 00:01:27.011]  favors a diplomatic approach for dealing with Iran's rogue nuclear program.
[00:01:27.011 --> 00:01:31.336]  We've worked with the European community and through the United Nations.
[00:01:32.136 --> 00:01:39.320]  ...to put in place a set of policies to persuade the Iranians to give up their aspirations and to resolve the matter peacefully.
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.961]  That's still our preference.
[00:01:40.961 --> 00:01:46.103]  But I've also made the point, the President's made the point, that all options are still on the table.
[00:01:46.103 --> 00:01:51.446]  Ten days of cracking down on violence in Baghdad has left about 400 suspected terrorists dead.
[00:01:51.446 --> 00:02:01.111]  Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki also says his government is dealing equally with Shiite and Sunni Muslims involved in the ongoing violent attacks in and around Baghdad.
[00:02:01.718 --> 00:02:04.960]  It's USA Radio Network News.
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.261]  Are you stressed out and tired of trying to make ends meet?
[00:02:08.261 --> 00:02:18.406]  Would you like to find a way to earn between $500 to $7,000 or more a month working from home with a company that gives you immediate and ongoing training, marketing and support?

[00:02:38.885 --> 00:02:39.986]  I actually made about twelve and
[00:02:40.086 --> 00:02:42.888]  I mean, $100 my very first month in the business.
[00:02:42.888 --> 00:02:45.350]  Obviously now it's well over 10 times that.

[00:03:05.407 --> 00:03:16.193]  Safety checks are being carried out on railway tracks across Britain today after a high-speed train crash in northern England killed an elderly woman and seriously injured several other passengers.
[00:03:16.193 --> 00:03:19.575]  Dr. Richard Castle, himself a survivor of previous train crashes,
[00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:24.481]  Of a previous train crash, says the survivors of this one will be very traumatized.
[00:03:24.481 --> 00:03:28.983]  My main concern actually is not for people who are physically injured, or indeed, the bereaved.
[00:03:28.983 --> 00:03:31.125]  By and large, needs are taken care of.
[00:03:31.125 --> 00:03:39.729]  My concern is for the people who, while that train was crashing on Friday evening, clearly thought they were going to die, and then walked away physically uninjured.
[00:03:40.578 --> 00:03:49.365]  The IRS says over 10 million taxpayers who filed their federal tax returns so far this year have not claimed the telephone excise tax refund.
[00:03:49.365 --> 00:03:53.088]  It's a one-time refund that's worth up to $60.
[00:03:53.088 --> 00:04:01.214]  The government decided to issue refunds after federal courts ruled the telephone excise tax was illegally applied to long-distance service.
[00:04:01.214 --> 00:04:03.016]  This is USA Radio Network News.
[00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:11.983]  When the IRS put a lien on my house, garnished my wages and levied my bank account, my attorney referred me to Associated Tax Relief.
[00:04:11.983 --> 00:04:13.724]  Calling them was the best move I ever made.
[00:04:13.724 --> 00:04:15.065]  They got us a settlement we could live with.
[00:04:15.065 --> 00:04:17.567]  Do you owe the IRS $10,000 or more?
[00:04:17.567 --> 00:04:19.588]  Associated Tax Relief can help you.
[00:04:19.588 --> 00:04:25.471]  Associated Tax Relief has helped taxpayers settle their tax debt with the IRS for mere pennies on the dollar.

[00:04:36.445 --> 00:04:40.207]  With increased terror threats come worries about the use of chemical weapons.
[00:04:40.207 --> 00:04:45.350]  So says Director General of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, Rogelio Prutter.
[00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:57.077]  The ease of access to dual-use chemicals and the readily available knowledge of the technologies and processes required to manufacture chemical weapons make them a potential instrument of choice for terrorists.
[00:04:57.077 --> 00:05:01.880]  While the Chemical Weapons Convention, which calls for the elimination of chemical weapons, was enacted in 1997,
[00:05:03.221 --> 00:05:06.943]  Some experts worry about the re-emergence of the potentially lethal weapons.
[00:05:06.943 --> 00:05:13.045]  This fear was realized last week when terrorists in Iraq detonated two bombs laced with chlorine.
[00:05:13.045 --> 00:05:26.050]  And a Virginia Beach, Virginia Catholic school principal has organized sensitivity training for students who shouted, we love Jesus, during a basketball game against a school with a predominantly Jewish population.
[00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.471]  There's more news on usaradio.com.
[00:05:28.471 --> 00:05:29.672]  Richard Curtis reporting.
[00:05:30.453 --> 00:05:33.056]  USA Radio, Network News.
[00:05:33.056 --> 00:05:36.641]  Oh wait, why did you turn that down?
[00:05:36.641 --> 00:05:39.324]  I get so tired of that girl's squeaky voice.
[00:05:39.324 --> 00:05:42.528]  I'm sure the bed fan works, but that squeaky voice.
[00:05:42.528 --> 00:05:43.930]  Well what's the bed fan?
[00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.313]  It's a fan that helps hot sleepers stay cool at night.
[00:05:46.573 --> 00:05:47.754]  I could use something like that.
[00:05:47.754 --> 00:05:50.297]  This menopause thing is really getting to me at night.
[00:05:50.297 --> 00:05:53.219]  And you know how I am about doing that hormone therapy thing.
[00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:55.121]  Besides, you're a hot sleeper yourself.
[00:05:55.121 --> 00:05:57.703]  You're always throwing the covers off in the middle of the night.
[00:05:57.703 --> 00:05:58.704]  I guess you're right.
[00:05:58.704 --> 00:05:59.545]  Why don't we try it?
[00:05:59.545 --> 00:06:01.487]  Just think how nice it'll be to sleep through the night.
[00:06:01.907 --> 00:06:06.270]  Yeah, and just think how nice it'll be this summer and all the money we can save on air conditioning.
[00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.331]  I know where we can get some more information.
[00:06:08.331 --> 00:06:12.834]  Sleep Disorder Centers across the country recommend that you must stay cool to get a good night's sleep.

[00:07:11.662 --> 00:07:13.523]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
[00:07:13.523 --> 00:07:22.152]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Sunday afternoon, Sunday evening, depending on your time zone as we syndicate out across the United States.
[00:07:22.927 --> 00:07:23.287]  Okay.
[00:07:23.287 --> 00:07:25.808]  I'm not tooting my own horn.
[00:07:25.808 --> 00:07:27.928]  With great power comes great responsibility.
[00:07:27.928 --> 00:07:30.809]  But we break major news reports every single week, sometimes every single day.
[00:07:52.466 --> 00:07:59.472]  But it's been a year or so since we've really brought you something this big and broken something this big.
[00:07:59.472 --> 00:08:10.803]  If you type into Google News, the number one news service now in the world, number one for traffic, that's Google and click News and type in Oklahoma City bombing or Oklahoma bombing, the first four links, at least this morning,
[00:08:11.463 --> 00:08:17.412]  And last night are articles from PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:08:17.412 --> 00:08:26.124]  Under them are reports out of the Salt Lake City Tribune and out of the Desert News.
[00:08:26.124 --> 00:08:27.647]  Reports like this are scary.
[00:08:28.647 --> 00:08:48.791]  I don't like having to bring this information to you, but we're going to be pretty much exclusively in the first hour into the second hour talking about the Oklahoma City bombing, which was an inside job perpetrated by members of Bill Clinton's Justice Department to bring the United States closer to the New World Order police state.
[00:08:48.791 --> 00:08:51.631]  It's the baby brother to 9-11.
[00:08:51.631 --> 00:08:57.212]  Administrations change, but the people running the country, the New World Order, remain the same.
[00:08:58.061 --> 00:09:22.397]  The first film I made ten years ago, in 1997, that I was producing in 1996, America Destroyed by Design, is about Oklahoma City attack, and we lay out how the government did it, why they did it, in that film made about a year and a half after the attack on the Alfred P. Murrah building at 9.02 a.m.
[00:09:22.397 --> 00:09:22.837]  on April 19, 1995.
[00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:33.653]  And everything I put in that film, my first film, I've since made 14 others, 15 films total, the latest is Terror Storm.
[00:09:33.653 --> 00:09:38.675]  Going as high as number 8 on the Amazon.com charts, which shows we're having an effect.
[00:09:38.675 --> 00:09:42.436]  Everything we laid out there has unfortunately turned out to be accurate and true.
[00:09:42.436 --> 00:09:50.759]  I was going off the state police, off the FBI, off the grand juror, the head of the grand jury, the grand jury foreman, Hoppy Honelberg.
[00:09:50.759 --> 00:09:52.860]  I was going off the testimony of cop of the year.
[00:09:53.832 --> 00:10:02.579]  Terrence Yakey, who all the evidence shows, FBI tortured to death and killed because he wouldn't shut up about the government being involved.
[00:10:02.579 --> 00:10:10.766]  That's right, cop of the year, who saved all those people, saw a little bit too much, them removing the bombs and the rest of it, so they killed him in cold blood.
[00:10:10.766 --> 00:10:21.234]  And we'll go over some of the basics of this because I can't get into the new developments without giving you some of the things that happened previously.
[00:10:21.234 --> 00:10:23.156]  Before you call me or email me and say,
[00:10:25.467 --> 00:10:26.908]  Why would the government do that?
[00:10:26.908 --> 00:10:27.768]  Let's be clear.
[00:10:27.768 --> 00:10:33.071]  Small criminal elements of our government did this.
[00:10:33.071 --> 00:10:46.017]  And they did this to pass the Omnibus Crime Bill and get triple the funding for the BATF, double the funding for the FBI, and to increase the total anti-terror budget by over 100%.
[00:10:48.032 --> 00:10:59.594]  Bill Clinton on Air Force One in 1996, after he had a 32% approval rating when the bombing took place, he was elected with a 68% approval rating, riding high a month after the election.
[00:10:59.594 --> 00:11:06.375]  A reporter in the White House press pool on Air Force One said, what do you owe your re-election to?
[00:11:06.375 --> 00:11:15.457]  And he said, the Oklahoma City bombing, it brought the country together, just like Hitler firebombing his own Reichstag helped bring the country together under the Fuhrer.
[00:11:16.326 --> 00:11:19.527]  And there's so much evidence in this, it would make your head spin.
[00:11:19.527 --> 00:11:26.250]  I have done three-hour programs on Coast to Coast AM with reporters coming on covering it as well.
[00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:28.171]  I've done my own syndicated show weekdays.
[00:11:28.171 --> 00:11:32.733]  I've probably done conservatively 75, 80 programs.
[00:11:32.733 --> 00:11:34.074]  I looked it up.
[00:11:34.074 --> 00:11:37.775]  In 2006, I did no fewer than 15 alone on this.
[00:11:37.775 --> 00:11:43.218]  I've already done several this year, several segments of a broadcast on it.
[00:11:43.218 --> 00:11:43.898]  So literally,
[00:11:44.801 --> 00:11:51.764]  It'd be like if you came to an engineer who had an engineering degree and you said, teach me how to engineer.
[00:11:51.764 --> 00:12:03.109]  I have been studying this since it happened almost 12 years ago, and there's so much evidence I don't even claim to have all the answers or know every little detail.
[00:12:03.109 --> 00:12:06.931]  So it's hard to walk through this, but we're going to try to today.
[00:12:06.931 --> 00:12:08.491]  Again, there's too much evidence.
[00:12:08.491 --> 00:12:11.533]  We have smoking guns piled up to the sky.
[00:12:11.533 --> 00:12:14.234]  It is now obscuring the sun, my friends.
[00:12:16.258 --> 00:12:19.500]  Let's just read through the latest headlines.
[00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:21.881]  This is the Salt Lake City Tribune.
[00:12:21.881 --> 00:12:22.321]  Nichols.
[00:12:22.321 --> 00:12:25.003]  McVeigh had high-level FBI help.
[00:12:25.003 --> 00:12:26.023]  Desert News.
[00:12:26.023 --> 00:12:29.265]  Nichols says bombing was FBI up.
[00:12:29.265 --> 00:12:34.868]  Now here's the more detailed reports that literally are receiving millions of readers.
[00:12:34.868 --> 00:12:35.488]  Attorney.
[00:12:35.488 --> 00:12:40.571]  Ashcroft gagged Nichols from exposing McVeigh's OKC bombing conspirators.
[00:12:40.571 --> 00:12:43.292]  Trinidad drops new bombshell on Alex Jones Show.
[00:12:43.292 --> 00:12:44.713]  This was Thursday.
[00:12:44.713 --> 00:12:45.153]  Breaking.
[00:12:47.017 --> 00:12:50.720]  Attorney sealed documents indicate OKC inside job.
[00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:52.060]  Here's another one.
[00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:54.442]  FBI agent early arrival in Oklahoma City.
[00:12:54.442 --> 00:12:55.963]  Hotel receipt shows it.
[00:12:55.963 --> 00:12:57.984]  World Net Daily.
[00:12:57.984 --> 00:13:04.969]  McVeigh at a military base two years after he was supposedly out of the military at a demolitions compound.
[00:13:04.969 --> 00:13:05.930]  It goes on and on.
[00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:07.611]  We're going to go over all of it.
[00:13:07.611 --> 00:13:11.173]  New OKC revelations spotlight FBI involvement in bombing.
[00:13:11.173 --> 00:13:14.996]  But again, before I go through all the new evidence, let me give you the big news.
[00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:18.951]  The Salt Lake City Tribune doesn't have it.
[00:13:18.951 --> 00:13:20.412]  ABC News doesn't have it.
[00:13:20.412 --> 00:13:21.693]  Guess who has it?
[00:13:21.693 --> 00:13:22.534]  Right here.
[00:13:22.534 --> 00:13:24.455]  In my hands.
[00:13:24.455 --> 00:13:27.817]  Right here.
[00:13:27.817 --> 00:13:37.103]  This is the declaration of Terry Lynn Nichols, United States District Court for the District of Utah, Central Division.
[00:13:37.103 --> 00:13:44.308]  Interviewed and deposed in his jail cell for a day and a half by Jesse C. Trinidou, plaintiff, attorney at law.
[00:13:45.211 --> 00:13:49.974]  And again, Jesse C. Trinidou's brother was mistaken as one of the black operators.
[00:13:49.974 --> 00:13:51.275]  That doesn't mean a black person, folks.
[00:13:51.275 --> 00:13:55.457]  One of the black world operators, one of the special forces individuals involved in this.
[00:13:55.457 --> 00:13:58.299]  So they tortured him to death because he matched another individual.
[00:13:58.299 --> 00:14:02.062]  Once the feds got that other fellow, they tortured him to death and hung him in a cell as well.
[00:14:02.062 --> 00:14:06.144]  So this Jesse C. Trinidou just started investigating this years ago.
[00:14:06.144 --> 00:14:07.465]  I interviewed him three and a half years ago.
[00:14:08.214 --> 00:14:16.458]  That's why I was really proud and honored when he made the point that on my radio program we originally broke all this, and now the documents have come out.
[00:14:16.458 --> 00:14:18.719]  We have the sealed federal documents.
[00:14:18.719 --> 00:14:21.400]  Let me just go ahead and get to the meat of the matter.
[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:25.783]  In my hand, I have the sealed federal documents.
[00:14:25.783 --> 00:14:30.565]  I have the sealed FBI documents in my hands right now.
[00:14:31.647 --> 00:14:41.815]  Trinidad, an accomplished lawyer, what, 25-30 years in practice, has never seen them seal something anywhere near this quick.
[00:14:41.815 --> 00:14:48.260]  Within a day of these being filed, they had already gotten a motion before the court to seal these.
[00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:54.265]  Now, not before we were able to see them, and not before
[00:14:55.279 --> 00:14:56.820]  And that's the only reason we can cover this.
[00:14:56.820 --> 00:15:03.023]  The Salt Lake City Tribune was able to see them and not before the Desert News was able to see them.
[00:15:03.023 --> 00:15:04.384]  So they were able to see them.
[00:15:04.384 --> 00:15:05.824]  We were able to see them.
[00:15:05.824 --> 00:15:06.865]  We have them right here.
[00:15:07.971 --> 00:15:30.727]  And yes, ladies and gentlemen, Trinidad wisely has not given to the media the most important sealed parts, and that is Exhibit A through G. The exhibits are the names, social security numbers of FBI agents, internal FBI documents that it turns out the defense had, that Stephen Jones reportedly had in the Denver trial.
[00:15:30.727 --> 00:15:35.630]  The federal judge would not allow them to put this evidence on for national security reasons.
[00:15:37.532 --> 00:15:41.133]  Now, you want to understand how they set patsies up and how they run black ops?
[00:15:41.133 --> 00:15:45.515]  Once you've studied a black op, you start learning there's two or three different types.
[00:15:45.515 --> 00:15:48.316]  There's really two main types, a couple of subgroups.
[00:15:48.316 --> 00:15:57.018]  We're going to walk through how they do this by first explaining what happened in Oklahoma City and then going through the evidence.
[00:15:57.018 --> 00:16:05.201]  But yes, ladies and gentlemen, if you go to PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com and JonesReport.com right now, you can read
[00:16:06.016 --> 00:16:08.878]  The federal documents for yourself.
[00:16:08.878 --> 00:16:11.659]  You can see them for yourself.
[00:16:11.659 --> 00:16:14.381]  Sealed under national security.
[00:16:14.381 --> 00:16:15.741]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:16:15.741 --> 00:16:16.522]  We'll be right back.
[00:16:16.522 --> 00:16:18.363]  Coast to coast and border to border.
[00:16:18.363 --> 00:16:19.623]  Exposing the terrorist.
[00:16:19.623 --> 00:16:20.764]  Defending the republic.
[00:16:34.798 --> 00:16:39.161]  Hi, I'm Joyce Riley and many of you know that for years I was a cardiovascular heart transplant nurse.
[00:16:39.161 --> 00:16:42.503]  Since that time I've educated myself on the importance of preventative care.
[00:16:42.503 --> 00:16:46.826]  It all begins with providing your heart and vascular system with the building blocks for good health.
[00:16:46.826 --> 00:16:50.849]  Strauss Heart Drops is the original formula that was copied by others but never duplicated.
[00:16:51.489 --> 00:16:57.056]  Strauss Heart Drops were developed by a master herbalist, Jim Strauss, after he suffered a heart attack in 1979.
[00:16:57.056 --> 00:17:01.501]  His doctor said he would only survive if he had heart bypass surgery, and Jim said no.
[00:17:01.501 --> 00:17:06.247]  He developed Strauss Heart Drops, the formula that has been copied by others, but never been surpassed.
[00:17:06.247 --> 00:17:08.749]  Get the original Strauss Heart Drops, 4-ounce bottle, for only $79.99.
[00:17:10.331 --> 00:17:12.353]  Call the Power Hour at 877-817-9829.
[00:17:12.353 --> 00:17:12.933]  877-817-9829.
[00:17:12.933 --> 00:17:20.479]  You've probably heard about the other products that have tried to copy the Strauss formula?
[00:17:20.479 --> 00:17:22.741]  Well, get the original Strauss Heart Drops by calling 877-817-9829.
[00:17:22.741 --> 00:17:23.021]  That's 877-817-9829.
[00:17:23.021 --> 00:17:25.784]  Now you could really do your heart right with Strauss Heart Drops.
[00:17:33.949 --> 00:17:38.071]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[00:17:38.071 --> 00:17:50.777]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[00:17:50.777 --> 00:17:51.217]  The U.S.
[00:17:51.217 --> 00:17:57.199]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[00:17:57.199 --> 00:17:59.420]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[00:18:01.261 --> 00:18:02.362]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[00:18:02.362 --> 00:18:05.343]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[00:18:05.343 --> 00:18:11.785]  However, shocking the economy with a reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[00:18:11.785 --> 00:18:15.206]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.
[00:18:15.206 --> 00:18:21.549]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.
[00:18:22.109 --> 00:18:26.231]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.
[00:18:26.231 --> 00:18:26.711]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:18:26.711 --> 00:18:29.252]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:18:29.252 --> 00:18:29.992]  It's here.
[00:18:29.992 --> 00:18:42.098]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:18:42.098 --> 00:18:49.741]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:18:50.413 --> 00:18:57.878]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:18:57.878 --> 00:19:09.605]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:19:09.605 --> 00:19:13.568]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:19:13.568 --> 00:19:15.829]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:19:15.829 --> 00:19:19.672]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:19:33.889 --> 00:19:35.389]  Hey Jane, how's it going?
[00:19:35.389 --> 00:19:37.530]  Gosh, I'm not doing so well.
[00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:42.051]  Even though I'm doing everything I'm supposed to do, my blood sugar is way out of control.
[00:19:42.051 --> 00:19:43.952]  Oh Jane, I'm sorry to hear that.
[00:19:43.952 --> 00:19:46.272]  I have to monitor my blood sugar again.
[00:19:46.272 --> 00:19:51.674]  If there was only something natural I could take that would help control my blood sugar that really works.
[00:19:51.674 --> 00:19:53.034]  Have you tried Sucroblast?
[00:19:53.806 --> 00:19:59.468]  For millions of Americans who can't keep their high blood sugar levels off their minds, there's Sucroblast.
[00:19:59.468 --> 00:20:04.350]  Sucroblast is the all-natural way to help keep your high blood sugar levels under control.

[00:20:22.122 --> 00:20:23.562]  So, Jane, what do you think?
[00:20:23.562 --> 00:20:27.743]  I'm going to call Sucroblast to set up a free consultation right now!
[00:20:27.743 --> 00:20:28.623]  Excellent, Jane.
[00:20:28.623 --> 00:20:29.804]  He'll be glad you did.
[00:20:29.804 --> 00:20:38.225]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:20:38.225 --> 00:20:44.327]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:20:44.327 --> 00:20:48.187]  Corruption never had a worse enemy.
[00:20:48.187 --> 00:20:50.348]  You're locked into the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:53.456 --> 00:20:56.120]  Okay, let's be clear.
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:21:02.207]  On February 16th, this filing was written up.
[00:21:02.207 --> 00:21:05.191]  It was filed several days later.
[00:21:05.191 --> 00:21:11.680]  Within a day, the federal government had sealed the filing and its exhibits.
[00:21:12.771 --> 00:21:21.339]  That was A through G. We're talking about the Oklahoma City bombing and the revelations by Terry Nichols that this was a government inside job, a black op.
[00:21:21.339 --> 00:21:23.161]  And we wouldn't just listen to Terry Nichols.
[00:21:23.161 --> 00:21:29.046]  We'll walk through his story and show how it fits in with all the pieces, the hundreds of pieces and smoking guns that we have.
[00:21:29.745 --> 00:21:40.354]  Since then, the federal judges said, since the media already had it, since it had already been reported on by major newspapers, that the filing can be public, just not the exhibits.
[00:21:40.354 --> 00:21:44.118]  And those are not public, and the government's fighting to keep those secret.
[00:21:44.118 --> 00:21:48.822]  In the filing, you learn that Nichols had been trying to
[00:21:49.965 --> 00:22:13.858]  He'd written a letter in 2004 to John Ashcroft, the then Attorney General, saying he wanted to go public about all this information, and then an order was put into effect over the Federal Bureau of Prisons in the Supermax he's in, there in the Rocky Mountains, and they wouldn't allow him to talk to any of the media, and the media could not get in to see him.
[00:22:13.858 --> 00:22:15.719]  I've talked to newspaper reporters, TV reporters,
[00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:18.483]  National reporters who weren't allowed to get in.
[00:22:18.483 --> 00:22:28.158]  In fact, there'd been a press report doing some research, I found, from 2004, where 60 Minutes tried to get in the scene, and the federal government said, no, no media.
[00:22:28.158 --> 00:22:30.782]  But, they couldn't keep a lawyer, and so...
[00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:44.680]  Because court proceedings had been started by Jesse Trinidou, and because Nichols could then say that he was having him in as his counsel, they couldn't stop Trinidou from getting in for a day and a half of interview time.
[00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:58.192]  Now, in this affidavit and in this request that's been filed as part of a lawsuit, they're asking that Jesse Trinidou, Attorney Trinidou, be able to go in and get a videotaped deposition of Terry Nichols.
[00:23:00.268 --> 00:23:04.729]  So there's some background about what's currently happening right now.
[00:23:04.729 --> 00:23:12.571]  Again, the headlines, Desert News, Nichols says bombing was FBI operation, Salt Lake City Tribune headline, Nichols McVeigh had high-level FBI help.
[00:23:12.571 --> 00:23:18.213]  Now, let's go back to what really happened in a nutshell in Oklahoma City.
[00:23:18.213 --> 00:23:19.353]  You'd have Ruby Ridge,
[00:23:20.074 --> 00:23:21.935]  Which had ended in a disaster.
[00:23:21.935 --> 00:23:26.537]  Larry Potts, the head of the operation, had gotten a reprimand letter.
[00:23:26.537 --> 00:23:31.599]  There was talk of the BATF being disbanded, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.
[00:23:31.599 --> 00:23:32.540]  Confiscation.
[00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:33.200]  Excuse me.
[00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:35.921]  The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.
[00:23:35.921 --> 00:23:39.143]  Then we have the videotapes that was in wake of the rules of engagement.
[00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:48.848]  And in several other films where it shows the BATF loading their big Betamax cameras saying, oh, we're going to get lots of funding off this, this is going to make us look good.
[00:23:48.848 --> 00:23:52.471]  They picked a group they thought was kooky and weird, regardless of what they were.
[00:23:52.471 --> 00:23:55.534]  The point is they were set up, they were attacked, they were shot at by helicopters.
[00:23:56.274 --> 00:23:58.335]  51 days into the siege, they burned the place down.
[00:23:58.335 --> 00:24:03.138]  Later that came out in congressional testimony and Delta Force documents when they sent the Delta Force in.
[00:24:03.138 --> 00:24:08.260]  Again, you have the same FBI agents that were involved, Lon Horiucci and others, from Ruby Ridge are there.
[00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:12.642]  That happens in 1993, a few months after Ruby Ridge.
[00:24:12.642 --> 00:24:18.686]  Just a few months after the first World Trade Center attack, which I'll get to in a moment.
[00:24:18.686 --> 00:24:19.386]  Same thing there.
[00:24:19.386 --> 00:24:20.586]  Government op will walk you through it.
[00:24:22.563 --> 00:24:30.308]  They've got this really bad name, there's talk of them being disbanded, because of Waco and Ruby Ridge, and then BOOM!
[00:24:30.308 --> 00:24:45.577]  9.02 a.m., 1995, a supposed truck bomb blows up out front and knocks out giant columns in the back of the building, the furthest away from the truck, but doesn't knock columns up over that are right up against the truck bomb.
[00:24:46.118 --> 00:24:55.105]  And there's videotape of these that the former head of Air Force Weapons Development, General Benton K. Barton, that's a three-star general, by the way, did analysis of it.
[00:24:55.105 --> 00:25:00.028]  You could see the columns blown off at 45 degree angles, perfect blast points.
[00:25:00.028 --> 00:25:01.589]  Okay, they were even blackened.
[00:25:01.589 --> 00:25:04.211]  So you've got the columns blown out at the back.
[00:25:04.211 --> 00:25:11.717]  You've got pieces of rubble blown across the street, big chunks of columns blown across the street, up on top of four-story buildings.
[00:25:12.572 --> 00:25:16.414]  Okay, we have video and photos of that in the film I made in 1997.
[00:25:16.414 --> 00:25:22.616]  Then in my film, The Road to Tyranny I made in 2002, we cover the First World Trade Center, Oklahoma City, and 9-11.
[00:25:22.616 --> 00:25:27.619]  And we spent 45 minutes in that three-hour film just on OKC with police surveillance tape.
[00:25:27.619 --> 00:25:28.959]  Oh yes, we got it.
[00:25:28.959 --> 00:25:30.840]  And newscasts as they're removing the bombs.
[00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:33.821]  But again, the problem is there's too much evidence here.
[00:25:33.821 --> 00:25:37.943]  Go to Google Video, type in Road to Tyranny, you can watch it for free tonight.
[00:25:37.943 --> 00:25:39.044]  After the show, that's your homework.
[00:25:40.686 --> 00:25:43.511]  And there's nothing more riveting than reality, is there?
[00:25:43.511 --> 00:25:46.877]  My hair on the back of my neck stands up every time I talk about this.
[00:25:46.877 --> 00:25:47.037]  So...
[00:25:48.539 --> 00:25:49.679]  This bomb goes off.
[00:25:49.679 --> 00:25:55.060]  Immediately, police start going, you know, the BATF in 30 seconds was in full bomb gear.
[00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:58.881]  The first firemen to arrive, the first police, some of them were just down the block.
[00:25:58.881 --> 00:26:03.162]  Some of them were there a minute after, and there's BATF with their bomb truck in full bomb gear.
[00:26:03.162 --> 00:26:05.302]  Some of it takes 20-30 minutes to put on.
[00:26:05.302 --> 00:26:08.043]  Running around, they run up to the local doctor, the local coroner.
[00:26:08.043 --> 00:26:10.423]  They say, bandage us up, we were on the 9th floor.
[00:26:10.423 --> 00:26:12.164]  The doctor says, you're not hurt, you're making that up.
[00:26:12.164 --> 00:26:12.904]  What are you talking about?
[00:26:12.904 --> 00:26:13.984]  How'd you get dressed so quick?
[00:26:14.631 --> 00:26:28.262]  That Terence Yankee, Cop of the Year, big, strong, handsome black guy, looks like an NFL linebacker, runs in, saves like 20-something people, almost breaks his back doing it, carrying him out on his shoulders.
[00:26:28.262 --> 00:26:33.206]  He sees him running around day one, he sees him in the bomb gear, he was just right down the street, Cop of the Year.
[00:26:33.826 --> 00:26:39.768]  He blows the whistle, is on the phone to his partner the night he died because the chief was telling him to get off the case.
[00:26:39.768 --> 00:26:42.929]  He's going to the storage shed they had because they've been told to hand over all their evidence.
[00:26:42.929 --> 00:26:46.630]  He said, I'm getting followed by a couple FBI feds.
[00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:47.290]  I gotta go.
[00:26:47.290 --> 00:26:49.071]  It looks like they're going to pull me over.
[00:26:49.071 --> 00:27:00.134]  He's found right off the road, about a couple hundred feet, tortured, tied to a tree with all these stab wounds and burn marks and his throat slit and shot twice in the back of the head.
[00:27:00.134 --> 00:27:00.695]  Cop of the year.
[00:27:00.695 --> 00:27:01.495]  These are cop killers.
[00:27:02.465 --> 00:27:07.007]  And again, he may have thought they were FBI, but we know there were special forces troops involved.
[00:27:07.007 --> 00:27:09.768]  Men associated with special forces, I should say.
[00:27:09.768 --> 00:27:13.749]  And so, that happened.
[00:27:13.749 --> 00:27:21.552]  In any black op, whether it's the Kennedy assassination or any of these events, they get lots of criminal groups and government groups involved.
[00:27:21.552 --> 00:27:27.254]  So there's layers of patsies, layers of distractions, different fallback groups.
[00:27:27.254 --> 00:27:31.896]  So let me tell you who we know, from videotape, police reports, surveillance cameras, everything.
[00:27:32.759 --> 00:27:35.181]  There were Iraqis involved.
[00:27:35.181 --> 00:27:36.362]  Okay?
[00:27:36.362 --> 00:27:39.265]  There were white supremacists involved.
[00:27:39.265 --> 00:27:42.728]  And there was the FBI and the BATF involved.
[00:27:42.728 --> 00:27:43.068]  Okay?
[00:27:43.068 --> 00:27:44.009]  Now, how did this work?
[00:27:44.009 --> 00:27:46.511]  And it's all in the deposition.
[00:27:46.511 --> 00:27:47.552]  It's all in the filing.
[00:27:47.552 --> 00:27:52.276]  Go read it up on PrisonPlanet.com right now with all the massive reportage.
[00:27:52.276 --> 00:27:56.060]  How did this happen?
[00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:59.663]  When you're going to carry out a knob, you can either provocateur one,
[00:28:01.989 --> 00:28:07.498]  Or you can simply carry it out yourself and then blame some innocent patsy you set up.
[00:28:07.498 --> 00:28:16.611]  Or you can do a combo of the two where there's a real attack that's going to be launched by the private corporation hired by the government to do it or by a government agency, a subgroup in that agency.
[00:28:16.611 --> 00:28:17.473]  You can do it that way.
[00:28:18.762 --> 00:28:31.427]  Or, the most common type is you go find people, and it may take years, and you recruit them, and you train them, and you lead them as a Klan leader, a Black Panther leader, a, you know, whatever quote radical group leader it is.
[00:28:31.427 --> 00:28:32.428]  We see this over and over again.
[00:28:32.428 --> 00:28:35.289]  We saw it in Miami, we saw it in Canada last year.
[00:28:36.454 --> 00:28:40.497]  Where they go find street kids, give them $100,000 over a year, give them video cameras.
[00:28:40.497 --> 00:28:42.659]  I mean, the FBI creates the group.
[00:28:42.659 --> 00:28:44.060]  The FBI created, you know, the Klan group in 98.
[00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:47.462]  Tried to give them the bomb a chemical plant outside Dallas.
[00:28:47.462 --> 00:28:50.465]  Bomb Stereo War, we talked about it last week, Texas Monthly.
[00:28:50.465 --> 00:28:58.551]  The major news report out of the Orlando Sentinel about the FBI leading the Nazi group in Orlando, March, behind the major groups, create fear.
[00:28:59.685 --> 00:29:00.625]  There's a lot of evidence here.
[00:29:00.625 --> 00:29:02.206]  Let's walk through it when we get back.
[00:29:02.206 --> 00:29:07.988]  We'll tell you what happened in Oklahoma City, the different groups they had to create a smoke screen around it.
[00:29:07.988 --> 00:29:09.169]  Alright?
[00:29:09.169 --> 00:29:11.810]  And then we'll get to your phone calls.
[00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:13.291]  We'll go through the affidavit.
[00:29:13.291 --> 00:29:14.311]  We'll go through the filing.
[00:29:14.311 --> 00:29:16.712]  We'll go through the latest news on this.
[00:29:16.712 --> 00:29:19.213]  This is huge, breaking news.
[00:29:19.213 --> 00:29:20.533]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:20.533 --> 00:29:21.054]  Stay with us.
[00:29:21.054 --> 00:29:21.794]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:29:33.422 --> 00:29:38.124]  According to the American Diabetes Association, more than 18 million people in the U.S.
[00:29:38.124 --> 00:29:39.164]  have diabetes.
[00:29:39.164 --> 00:29:46.267]  Most people with diabetes have risk factors such as obesity, high blood pressure, and cholesterol, which increase their risk for heart disease.
[00:29:46.267 --> 00:29:50.989]  For example, more than 65% of people with diabetes die from heart disease or stroke.
[00:29:50.989 --> 00:29:53.970]  Finding out you or your loved ones have diabetes can be scary.

[00:30:32.988 --> 00:30:36.129]  My friend laughed at me when I said I could order in French.
[00:30:36.129 --> 00:30:47.911]  But when the waiter came, I just smiled and said, Millions of people everywhere are learning new languages faster than they thought possible with Rosetta Stone software.

[00:31:26.204 --> 00:31:26.404]  That's 1-800-441-3955.
[00:31:32.566 --> 00:31:37.831]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming and the end of the world?
[00:31:37.831 --> 00:31:39.913]  You shall hear of wars and rumors of wars.
[00:31:39.913 --> 00:31:43.136]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[00:31:43.136 --> 00:31:46.579]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[00:31:46.579 --> 00:31:48.421]  We are living in this time of Earth's history.
[00:31:48.681 --> 00:31:52.662]  Many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom.
[00:31:52.662 --> 00:31:55.943]  But without the wisdom of God, this is impossible.
[00:31:55.943 --> 00:32:00.444]  2 Peter says, We have a more sure word of prophecy, and you do well if you take heed.
[00:32:00.444 --> 00:32:05.145]  But first know this, that no prophecy of the Scripture is of any private interpretation.
[00:32:05.145 --> 00:32:07.665]  The Bible says, Would like you to receive this new offer.
[00:32:07.665 --> 00:32:09.786]  Packet B, the unholy alliance.
[00:32:09.786 --> 00:32:11.806]  These materials document the global leaders.
[00:32:11.886 --> 00:32:12.126]  We're good.
[00:32:32.518 --> 00:32:35.499]  Attention, this is an urgent GCN News Bulletin.
[00:32:35.499 --> 00:32:37.799]  Do you desperately need to get out of debt fast?
[00:32:37.799 --> 00:32:40.760]  Would you like to make some of your debts disappear completely?
[00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:45.241]  If so, and you're a GCN listener, there's a very real chance that you'll now be able to do it.
[00:32:45.241 --> 00:32:45.841]  Here's why.
[00:32:45.841 --> 00:32:52.763]  A new manual has just been published that reveals how you can get out of debt in 90 minutes without any loans or bankruptcy whatsoever.
[00:32:52.763 --> 00:32:59.104]  The insider secrets revealed allow you to get out of debt so fast and so completely that it makes some people feel like they're cheating, but they're not.
[00:32:59.104 --> 00:32:59.384]  Why?
[00:32:59.384 --> 00:33:03.328]  The secrets taught in the manual are 100% legal and 100% ethical.
[00:33:03.328 --> 00:33:08.033]  It's just that bankers, debt collectors, and credit card companies don't want you to know about these loopholes.
[00:33:08.033 --> 00:33:15.201]  Learn how to finally teach those financial vultures some humility by beating them at their own game, and above all, learn how to bail out for a soft landing.
[00:33:15.661 --> 00:33:18.342]  Get control, get relief, get some sleep!
[00:33:18.342 --> 00:33:19.383]  Go to www.outand90.com.
[00:33:19.383 --> 00:33:20.424]  That's www.outand90.com.
[00:33:20.424 --> 00:33:21.124]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[00:33:21.124 --> 00:33:21.384]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:33:21.384 --> 00:33:24.786]  You're listening to GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:33:45.461 --> 00:33:50.668]  Crushing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:33:50.668 --> 00:33:53.632]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:53.632 --> 00:33:55.034]  And risking my life.
[00:33:55.034 --> 00:33:58.158]  A lot of people have died to bring you the information you're getting.
[00:33:58.158 --> 00:33:59.300]  A lot of people have gone to prison.
[00:34:00.166 --> 00:34:04.411]  Carol Howell, FBI informant, who they recruited, no criminal record.
[00:34:04.411 --> 00:34:08.575]  She went public just a few weeks before and said they're about to bomb the Alfred P. Murrow building.
[00:34:08.575 --> 00:34:13.240]  They pulled her off the case and threatened her to shut up, and when she wouldn't, they tried to indict her.
[00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:15.703]  She was found not guilty of the stuff they trumped up.
[00:34:15.703 --> 00:34:16.844]  That's the problem here.
[00:34:16.844 --> 00:34:18.285]  There's too much evidence.
[00:34:18.285 --> 00:34:20.588]  For those that just joined us, Terry Nichols says
[00:34:21.949 --> 00:34:25.732]  Alfred P. Murrah building bombing was FBI-opped out of the Desert News.
[00:34:25.732 --> 00:34:27.933]  Salt Lake City Tribune with its federal lawsuit was filed.
[00:34:27.933 --> 00:34:30.435]  McVeigh had high-level help from FBI.
[00:34:30.435 --> 00:34:31.896]  We're walking through that.
[00:34:31.896 --> 00:34:38.620]  I now have the, at least partially unsealed, I have the part that's been unsealed, filing the federal lawsuit.
[00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:50.468]  The particular document, the exhibits with the names of the FBI agents and others have been sealed, but not before the Desert News reported who Terry Nichols says was the handler of Timothy McVeigh.
[00:34:51.631 --> 00:34:58.259]  And Larry Nichols, and that was Larry Potts, former head of FBI counterterrorism.
[00:34:59.028 --> 00:35:04.409]  Oh yes, we'll be going over all of that this evening, and I know we've got lots of phone calls.
[00:35:04.409 --> 00:35:12.390]  If you want to talk about this subject, I'll go to other calls on other subjects, but you won't be on with us long because I need to stay focused.
[00:35:12.390 --> 00:35:15.011]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-590-5525, 877-590-5525, or locally here in Central Texas, 836-0590.
[00:35:15.011 --> 00:35:17.551]  We're listening to our home-based mothership affiliate, KLBJ 590.
[00:35:17.551 --> 00:35:17.751]  KLBJ 590 AM.
[00:35:29.978 --> 00:35:33.300]  Again, I've got to move quickly here because there's so much.
[00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:35.081]  The government wants to set up a police state.
[00:35:35.081 --> 00:35:36.001]  They want more funds.
[00:35:36.001 --> 00:35:37.462]  These agencies want more funds.
[00:35:37.462 --> 00:35:41.564]  The global corporations that have gotten control of this nation want to secure their control over us.
[00:35:41.564 --> 00:35:45.647]  They need to carry out terror attacks or provocateur them or to allow them to take place.
[00:35:45.647 --> 00:35:46.407]  They do different things.
[00:35:46.407 --> 00:35:54.091]  It's a grab bag to convince the public to willingly relinquish their liberty in the name of some so-called security.
[00:35:54.091 --> 00:35:57.033]  You give up liberty, you get tyranny, not security.
[00:35:58.195 --> 00:36:03.660]  And so the bomb goes off and it kills 168 people, including a bunch of children in a daycare center.
[00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:06.022]  I don't have to remind you of all of this.
[00:36:06.022 --> 00:36:09.265]  And then it starts coming out day one that there were bombs inside the building.
[00:36:09.265 --> 00:36:11.167]  Newscasts, police start talking about it.
[00:36:11.167 --> 00:36:12.829]  They start dying.
[00:36:12.829 --> 00:36:13.850]  Firemen start talking.
[00:36:13.850 --> 00:36:15.331]  They start dying.
[00:36:15.331 --> 00:36:17.553]  I mean, we're talking about medical examiners start talking.
[00:36:17.553 --> 00:36:18.434]  They start dying.
[00:36:18.434 --> 00:36:21.657]  We're talking about gunshots to the back of the head, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:36:22.392 --> 00:36:24.435]  And then you ask, well, why didn't McVeigh speak up?
[00:36:24.435 --> 00:36:29.901]  McVeigh was totally drugged up, totally handled, and again, that's a whole other show of evidence.
[00:36:29.901 --> 00:36:34.968]  But we now have a filed federal lawsuit
[00:36:35.932 --> 00:36:41.213]  With the filing and sworn affidavit of Larry Nichols, who has nothing to gain from this.
[00:36:41.213 --> 00:36:43.734]  Life in prison for being associated with this.
[00:36:43.734 --> 00:36:45.054]  Clearly a patsy day one.
[00:36:45.054 --> 00:36:46.574]  We've always known this.
[00:36:46.574 --> 00:36:48.515]  Now let's go into how black ops work.
[00:36:48.515 --> 00:36:55.236]  The criminal elements of the government can either carry it out, or they can do their favorite thing, but it's harder and provocateur.
[00:36:55.236 --> 00:36:57.056]  Now here's an example that's not debatable.
[00:36:57.056 --> 00:37:00.937]  New York Times, CBS News, that's in road to tyranny as well.
[00:37:00.937 --> 00:37:03.078]  The evidence I'm giving you was hidden in plain view.
[00:37:03.078 --> 00:37:04.158]  No one ever got in trouble for it.
[00:37:04.927 --> 00:37:16.870]  In the first World Trade Center attack of 1993, the FBI created the group, cooked the bomb, trained the drivers, and by the grace of God, they didn't park it up against the main column like they were supposed to.
[00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:26.093]  A few days before, Ahmad Salam, the CIA-funded agent, an Egyptian intelligence agent, had been brought over to build it.
[00:37:26.093 --> 00:37:28.514]  He said, I thought it was a sting, we've got to go bust them.
[00:37:28.514 --> 00:37:30.514]  The FBI said, no, it goes forward.
[00:37:30.514 --> 00:37:32.215]  He rightfully thought they were setting him up.
[00:37:33.915 --> 00:37:41.098]  He went in and recorded the head of the FBI in New York and others saying it's going to go forward, leave it alone, you can't stop this, we'll protect you.
[00:37:41.098 --> 00:37:42.058]  So, he went, what?
[00:37:42.058 --> 00:37:43.079]  You funded me?
[00:37:43.079 --> 00:37:44.699]  You gave me over a million dollars?
[00:37:44.699 --> 00:37:49.381]  I went and built this bomb, did this, and now you're going to let it happen?
[00:37:49.381 --> 00:37:52.122]  That's a case of pure provocateur.
[00:37:52.122 --> 00:37:52.683]  Okay?
[00:37:52.683 --> 00:37:58.945]  Now, in the case of Oklahoma City, they learned not to trust the people that they trained to do it, to carry it out.
[00:37:58.945 --> 00:38:02.106]  Again, Patsy's thinking they were being led by some Islamicist.
[00:38:02.106 --> 00:38:03.227]  Some Islamofascist.
[00:38:04.682 --> 00:38:09.743]  In Oklahoma City, you have the Ryder truck that detonates outside and leaves this one-foot crater.
[00:38:09.743 --> 00:38:11.163]  They later claimed it was a 20-foot crater.
[00:38:11.163 --> 00:38:11.783]  We have the video.
[00:38:11.783 --> 00:38:12.424]  It wasn't.
[00:38:12.424 --> 00:38:15.064]  You have bombs inside blowing the building clearly out.
[00:38:15.064 --> 00:38:18.325]  So you have the diversionary blast outside, the real blast inside.
[00:38:18.325 --> 00:38:19.905]  Three of the bombs don't go off, at least.
[00:38:19.905 --> 00:38:23.506]  We have video of them being removed and the governor announcing they found more bombs.
[00:38:23.506 --> 00:38:26.326]  Because most of the BATF and police that were there were not part of it.
[00:38:26.326 --> 00:38:29.547]  They were there finding bombs and taking them out and saying, look, we got them off the columns.
[00:38:29.967 --> 00:38:31.448]  You know, there were bombs inside.
[00:38:31.448 --> 00:38:35.889]  And then the FBI and Clinton and Janet Reno said, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:38:35.889 --> 00:38:38.050]  You don't understand.
[00:38:38.050 --> 00:38:55.315]  Then state police, hours after McVeigh's driving erratically, running off the road, he's got a big yellow car with no license plate, can't be missed, they pull him over, he's drooling and saying, I've got a chip, I've got a chip, clearly out of his mind, drugged or something, under some type of mind control.
[00:38:56.195 --> 00:39:02.999]  Then, you've got these three Arabs, these three Iraqis, we even know their names, it's in the film, it's been in the news.
[00:39:02.999 --> 00:39:12.966]  One of them was Al-Husseini Hussein, who we've got Oklahoma City Police surveillance video him weeks before the bombing, sneaking around, they knew what he was involved in.
[00:39:12.966 --> 00:39:18.469]  They catch him trying to fly out of the country with blue jogging suits, wires, you name it.
[00:39:20.126 --> 00:39:22.767]  The Clinton Justice Department orders them be released.
[00:39:22.767 --> 00:39:26.529]  Then we start hearing reports that McVeigh had been staying in Elohim City with these Nazis.
[00:39:26.529 --> 00:39:29.330]  It turns out federal informants have got video of all this.
[00:39:29.330 --> 00:39:30.931]  They're told shut up and forget about it.
[00:39:30.931 --> 00:39:33.312]  Everybody's told forget about John Doe number two.
[00:39:33.312 --> 00:39:46.518]  Then we learn there's 12 surveillance cameras from the Methodist Church, from a bank, from a YMCA, from the federal building itself, across the street, showing McVeigh get out of the Ryder truck with this dark-complected, dark-haired man.
[00:39:47.715 --> 00:39:49.377]  Who he believes is one of the Iraqis.
[00:39:49.377 --> 00:39:52.599]  Going down the street, other cars, everybody breaks up and drives off.
[00:39:52.599 --> 00:39:56.282]  The Feds declare national security on that and seal it.
[00:39:56.282 --> 00:40:05.089]  Valiant FBI agents go public in the LA Times, the Washington Post, we have those articles in the films, and they say, listen, we've seen the surveillance before it got sealed.
[00:40:05.089 --> 00:40:06.950]  It shows Iraqis.
[00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:11.614]  Congressman Dana Roybacher goes on MSNBC and CNN in the last few weeks.
[00:40:13.391 --> 00:40:18.557]  There's a connection to the Philippines, and Bojinka, and to Ramsey Yusuf, and it's Iraq!
[00:40:18.557 --> 00:40:20.258]  Oh my gosh, it's Iran!
[00:40:20.258 --> 00:40:23.321]  See how far back they planted all of this?
[00:40:23.321 --> 00:40:31.390]  And it's in the signed depositions that, there's two of them, it's not just Nichols, it's one of the other individuals in there as well, that's gone to prison over this.
[00:40:32.817 --> 00:40:45.426]  They admit that Rohrabacher went in and interviewed him a few months ago, but said, I don't want to talk about anything but your trip to the Philippines, I don't want to talk about anything but Arabs, and there was an FBI agent there not letting Nichols tell him everything he knew.
[00:40:45.426 --> 00:40:53.432]  That's all sworn to in here, and Rohrabacher, the congressman, the neocon, who poses as the good guy, admittedly went and interviewed him.
[00:40:54.807 --> 00:41:10.098]  So, we've got white supremacists involved, we've got McVeigh going to every major gun show in the country, every major militia compound in the country, and it says to create a history, to create a ledger, to create a story, to create a connection between him and the militia movement so the bombing could be blamed on him.
[00:41:10.098 --> 00:41:16.943]  Then, in the affidavit, Larry Potts reportedly calls up this FBI top agent, calls up McVeigh and says,
[00:41:18.050 --> 00:41:21.432]  The bombing isn't going to be in Omaha or Dallas now, it's going to be in Oklahoma City.
[00:41:21.432 --> 00:41:29.196]  McVeigh blows up and says, I was recruited out of the military into a secret assassination black ops squad, which we already knew.
[00:41:29.196 --> 00:41:36.779]  We've got video of him at bases two years after he was supposedly out of the military, that by the way we broke, up on PrisonPlanet.com, and we've been on this story.
[00:41:36.779 --> 00:41:38.300]  And again, that's a whole other discussion there.
[00:41:41.633 --> 00:41:48.196]  So, you've got Andrei Strassmayer, who turns out to be a German intelligence agent, posing as a national Nazi, who's connected to McVeigh.
[00:41:48.196 --> 00:41:49.497]  You've got all this going on.
[00:41:49.497 --> 00:41:50.658]  Perfect black-off.
[00:41:50.658 --> 00:41:59.582]  You've got Arabs involved, you've got white supremacists, you've got FBI with a special forces operative, McVeigh going out, doing all this.
[00:41:59.582 --> 00:42:00.823]  Clearly set up.
[00:42:00.823 --> 00:42:07.206]  And then you learn what was originally in the sealed documents inside the Denver trial.
[00:42:08.118 --> 00:42:09.860]  Of McVeigh and Nichols.
[00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:14.143]  You learn what we've gotten from police and others who investigated this.
[00:42:14.143 --> 00:42:16.065]  That Nichols was completely set up.
[00:42:16.065 --> 00:42:17.587]  That he was on the periphery.
[00:42:17.587 --> 00:42:23.191]  That all he did was help rob a facility of some gel explosives at a mining outfit.
[00:42:23.191 --> 00:42:26.975]  That his family was threatened the entire time to do all of this.
[00:42:27.998 --> 00:42:35.887]  You then learn that they told him to rob this individual Roger Moore of guns, which it turns out was a federal informant.
[00:42:35.887 --> 00:42:44.017]  They were creating a history, again a ledger, and then when he got there, Moore knew it was all staged and quote, part of the FBI script.
[00:42:44.017 --> 00:42:48.082]  So those guns could later be found at Nichols' home.
[00:42:50.143 --> 00:42:53.525]  And McVeigh gave them a small box of explosives and said, keep these.
[00:42:53.525 --> 00:42:59.848]  So it was clear that McVeigh was planning to set up Nichols, and they ended up burning their own operative, just like Lee Harvey Oswald, who was Special Forces.
[00:42:59.848 --> 00:43:03.290]  By the way, we now have his CIA control number.
[00:43:03.290 --> 00:43:05.611]  Only black operators are even gonna understand what I'm talking about.
[00:43:05.611 --> 00:43:08.733]  This is so complex.
[00:43:08.733 --> 00:43:12.594]  And I bet you are listening, aren't you, you black operators?
[00:43:12.594 --> 00:43:14.876]  Well, I'm already in it, so I'm gonna go all the way.
[00:43:14.876 --> 00:43:17.457]  When we get back, I'll continue to try to break all this down.
[00:43:18.115 --> 00:43:22.271]  And explain what the Arabs were really doing, what the white supremacists were doing.
[00:43:22.271 --> 00:43:23.536]  We really carried out the bombing.
[00:43:23.536 --> 00:43:23.937]  Stay with us.

[00:44:39.143 --> 00:44:42.484]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big business and the American empire.
[00:44:45.304 --> 00:44:48.985]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism.

[00:45:50.657 --> 00:45:53.718]  When are you gonna get it through your head that there is no quick fix?
[00:45:53.718 --> 00:45:54.978]  No free lunch?

[00:47:53.319 --> 00:47:58.060]  For over 11 years, I've been investigating the Oklahoma City bombing.
[00:47:58.060 --> 00:48:03.802]  The great foundation of the current police state we see expanding.
[00:48:03.802 --> 00:48:06.422]  We're going to take your calls on this subject coming up in the next hour.
[00:48:06.422 --> 00:48:07.543]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-590-5525.
[00:48:07.543 --> 00:48:07.783]  Locally, 836-0590.
[00:48:15.339 --> 00:48:16.420]  Let me just recap.
[00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:28.490]  Terry Nichols, and the feds sealed this almost immediately, was interviewed by a lawyer who's been investigating the case for many years because he lost a family member as a result of it.
[00:48:28.490 --> 00:48:32.393]  That's just how he got into this.
[00:48:32.393 --> 00:48:34.555]  His brother knew a little too much and was tortured to death and murdered.
[00:48:36.033 --> 00:48:37.454]  Has gone in and interviewed Nichols.
[00:48:37.454 --> 00:48:42.217]  Nichols has been banned from any media contact, including 60 Minutes wasn't allowed in the scene.
[00:48:42.217 --> 00:48:47.059]  To cover this up, after he went to Ashcroft, he wrote a letter and said, I want to tell you what really happened here.
[00:48:47.059 --> 00:48:48.941]  Because he'd never confessed before.
[00:48:48.941 --> 00:48:51.462]  He said, I want to tell you how I got set up and how all this really worked.
[00:48:51.462 --> 00:48:53.503]  And I'm telling you, this fits in with my 11 years
[00:48:55.124 --> 00:48:56.945]  of research on this subject.
[00:48:56.945 --> 00:48:58.706]  I made a film in 97 about this.
[00:48:58.706 --> 00:49:01.627]  I want to be clear about my credentials on this subject.
[00:49:01.627 --> 00:49:07.350]  Nichols says bombing was an FBI operation, and you go through the evidence, it was.
[00:49:07.350 --> 00:49:09.431]  Okay?
[00:49:09.431 --> 00:49:11.552]  Why did they have Arabs involved?
[00:49:11.552 --> 00:49:20.196]  You have to first understand that Saddam was our ally, and that tens of thousands of Iraqi Republican Guard, his entire apparatus, including Saddam, back when he was 18 years old in 1958, was U.S.
[00:49:20.196 --> 00:49:20.817]  government control.
[00:49:24.210 --> 00:49:37.278]  At the end of the first Gulf War, George Bush Senior, Washington Post, LA Times, Associated Press, this is all in my film Road to Tyranny, all the news articles, but you can type it into Google and find it for yourself, it's all out there, mainstream articles.
[00:49:37.278 --> 00:49:39.060]  You know, all the pieces are right there.
[00:49:39.060 --> 00:49:46.965]  Brought back 3,000 Iraqi Republican Guard, then Clinton brought in another 1,900 plus.
[00:49:46.965 --> 00:49:49.106]  Some numbers are over 2,000, we'll go with the conservative one.
[00:49:49.597 --> 00:49:56.702]  Now, they're not all terrorists, but large portions of them were trained previously by our government, trained at the different schools, like School of Americas.
[00:49:56.702 --> 00:49:57.543]  That's for Latin Americans.
[00:49:57.543 --> 00:49:59.364]  They have separate ones for Arabs.
[00:49:59.364 --> 00:50:01.526]  They were brought back in after the war.
[00:50:01.526 --> 00:50:03.147]  They were put in all major U.S.
[00:50:03.147 --> 00:50:03.547]  cities.
[00:50:03.547 --> 00:50:06.749]  This has been on Oklahoma TV.
[00:50:06.749 --> 00:50:08.891]  Reporters have written books about this.
[00:50:08.891 --> 00:50:11.032]  Okay, this is part of the record.
[00:50:11.032 --> 00:50:15.556]  So you've got these individuals brought here, trained by our government, on the payroll.
[00:50:15.556 --> 00:50:17.517]  Lord knows what they're doing, showing up
[00:50:18.251 --> 00:50:24.676]  In the weeks before the bombing to a level that the state police and Oklahoma police intelligence units were videotaping them.
[00:50:24.676 --> 00:50:33.282]  And there are literally hundreds of witnesses at topless bars and hotels and shops and gun shows with these Iraqis and McVeigh!
[00:50:33.282 --> 00:50:34.723]  Okay?
[00:50:34.723 --> 00:50:37.865]  Then you've got McVeigh with German intelligence agents.
[00:50:37.865 --> 00:50:40.147]  You've got McVeigh at white supremacist compounds.
[00:50:40.147 --> 00:50:46.171]  You've got McVeigh going around creating a history and now that's in the affidavits to connect it to militias showing up at every group.
[00:50:46.171 --> 00:50:47.132]  He showed up at Waco.
[00:50:48.214 --> 00:50:50.255]  During the seizures, video of that.
[00:50:50.255 --> 00:50:52.877]  To create this history and this ledger.
[00:50:52.877 --> 00:50:57.520]  Now, more often than not, in these black ops, they didn't set up their own Patsy like Lee Harvey Oswald.
[00:50:57.520 --> 00:51:01.743]  Don't have time to get into that, but again, it's mainstream, history channel news.
[00:51:01.743 --> 00:51:07.167]  It's been all, Barr McClellan, LBJ's former lawyer, it just goes on and on.
[00:51:07.167 --> 00:51:09.849]  So much evidence, it'll make your head spin.
[00:51:10.683 --> 00:51:22.766]  That he was a black op operator, taken out of the Marines, he was at a super secret base in Japan, allowed to defect to the Russians, then allowed to come back after two years left alone.
[00:51:22.766 --> 00:51:25.386]  I've interviewed the daughter, the mother, all of it.
[00:51:25.386 --> 00:51:29.067]  Clear black ops, and he said, I'm Apache, I've been set up, clearly involved.
[00:51:29.067 --> 00:51:37.569]  But you've got shooters all around, you've got mafia involved, you've got Texas hit men, one of them's in federal prison right now for pulling another hit in San Antonio.
[00:51:37.569 --> 00:51:38.349]  Charles Harrelson.
[00:51:39.944 --> 00:51:40.704]  It's the same thing.
[00:51:40.704 --> 00:51:49.486]  You've got private contractor hit men, you've got mafia, you've got Cubans trained in Operation Zebra.
[00:51:49.486 --> 00:51:52.047]  You've got all these people, so there's different layers.
[00:51:52.047 --> 00:52:01.149]  You study the OSS in World War II in Greece and in Italy and in France.
[00:52:01.149 --> 00:52:04.190]  They operated, they nexused with the criminal gangs.
[00:52:04.190 --> 00:52:05.270]  It's the same thing today.
[00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:08.111]  That's who knows the local area, that gives you plausible deniability.
[00:52:09.136 --> 00:52:11.338]  So that's why you've got all these groups as fallbacks.
[00:52:11.338 --> 00:52:16.462]  The white supremacists, the Arabs, but all of them we know the groups were being run by the feds.
[00:52:16.462 --> 00:52:26.111]  The Arabs are run by feds, the Nazis that came out in federal documents were run by the feds, and you've got McVeigh going around grooming his patsy, which is Larry Nichols.
[00:52:27.213 --> 00:52:28.994]  And that's now all come out in the affidavit.
[00:52:28.994 --> 00:52:38.120]  We already said this years ago in films, this is what most of the police and FBI who weren't part of the program, who haven't carried out the attack, who are trying to expose this have said and written books on.
[00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:44.624]  This is what the evidence clearly shows in context.
[00:52:44.624 --> 00:52:53.409]  And so what you have is McVeigh with one of the Iraqis pulls up with a truck bomb, he goes and gets in his own car, goes driving off, something happens, he gets picked up by the state police, out of his mind,
[00:52:54.076 --> 00:52:54.817]  Literally drooling.
[00:52:54.817 --> 00:53:00.482]  The state police report he was drooling, falling down, saying, don't let him do it, it hurts, it hurts, I got a chip.
[00:53:00.482 --> 00:53:01.583]  Who knows what that is?
[00:53:01.583 --> 00:53:04.326]  The point is, he was doing this!
[00:53:04.326 --> 00:53:11.432]  He was totally... Then they hired Jolion West from the time he's arrested to the time he's executed in 2001, who in the 77 hearings declassified MKUltra.
[00:53:15.914 --> 00:53:24.617]  He was one of the chief people who was made to testify and who was brought out, also along with Dr. Ewing Cameron, involved in MKUltra.
[00:53:24.617 --> 00:53:31.339]  So one of the most famous mind control doctors is McVeigh's doctor from the time he's arrested to the time he's executed.
[00:53:31.339 --> 00:53:32.700]  Again, this is central casting.
[00:53:32.700 --> 00:53:35.961]  Like George Norris said, you could not make something up this weird.
[00:53:37.163 --> 00:53:39.664]  I mean, if this was a fiction book, no one would buy it.
[00:53:39.664 --> 00:53:41.565]  That's what they do in black ops.
[00:53:41.565 --> 00:53:44.706]  They do it to be a smokescreen, to be confusing.
[00:53:44.706 --> 00:53:47.266]  It's called cloaked and dagger for a reason.
[00:53:47.266 --> 00:53:49.527]  You don't know where the dagger is because it's cloaked.
[00:53:49.527 --> 00:53:51.828]  It's a black op.
[00:53:51.828 --> 00:53:54.629]  But in hindsight, we have enough pieces to know what happened.
[00:53:54.629 --> 00:54:01.891]  Feds, and the BATF, by the way, six months before was out in the Arizona desert blowing up rider trucks full of C4, doing tests.
[00:54:02.535 --> 00:54:06.842]  We know the feds, probably BATF, because they were in their bomb gear and running around right when it happened.
[00:54:08.015 --> 00:54:13.098]  And some of them did believe it was a stink, because they did call another group of BATF and tell them, be ready the night before.
[00:54:13.098 --> 00:54:14.379]  We have hotel receipts, everything.
[00:54:14.379 --> 00:54:16.040]  Because again, you have innocent people too.
[00:54:16.040 --> 00:54:21.524]  And then they always keep the innocent, good agents from not knowing what's happening, telling them it's a drill, it's part of an op.
[00:54:21.524 --> 00:54:25.226]  I know there's agents listening out there right now going, that's happened to me on other things.
[00:54:25.226 --> 00:54:29.309]  Stings, criminal ops, when they're stealing money from drug dealers, whatever.
[00:54:29.309 --> 00:54:32.231]  They have formulas of doing this because it works.
[00:54:34.099 --> 00:54:36.802]  There's plastic explosives inside that blow out the main columns.
[00:54:36.802 --> 00:54:39.466]  The diversionary blast is timed to go off at the same time.
[00:54:39.466 --> 00:54:42.570]  The evidence shows that it went off a few seconds before, early.
[00:54:42.570 --> 00:54:44.913]  Everybody inside said they heard a boom.
[00:54:44.913 --> 00:54:45.994]  The windows blew out.
[00:54:45.994 --> 00:54:47.356]  Then the whole building started shaking.
[00:54:47.356 --> 00:54:48.918]  There were explosions under it.
[00:54:48.918 --> 00:54:51.301]  Jane Graham, the head of HUD, up on the top floor,
[00:54:52.498 --> 00:54:58.980]  Reported that she liked to use the maintenance entrances for exercise, because she was overweight, to go jogging up them every morning.
[00:54:58.980 --> 00:55:01.280]  That was her exercise and jogging back down.
[00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:11.463]  And that she saw white men in there, later who by the way were videotaped the day of the event, and she said that's them, planting large gray sticks of butter on columns and drilling with electrical wire.
[00:55:11.463 --> 00:55:12.323]  She said, what are you doing?
[00:55:12.323 --> 00:55:13.824]  They were wearing federal maintenance uniforms.
[00:55:13.824 --> 00:55:14.464]  He said, maintenance.
[00:55:14.904 --> 00:55:17.005]  This is the day before the bombing.
[00:55:17.005 --> 00:55:18.426]  Again, one more little piece of evidence.
[00:55:18.426 --> 00:55:27.131]  The head grand juror, Hoppy Heidelberg, was learning all this from the police and witnesses, and the FBI came to his house and brandished guns and said, you shut up and don't ask questions anymore.
[00:55:27.131 --> 00:55:29.712]  I've interviewed Hoppy many times.
[00:55:29.712 --> 00:55:31.814]  Hundreds of these pieces of evidence.
[00:55:31.814 --> 00:55:34.255]  So, you've got McVeigh with all these other groups.
[00:55:34.255 --> 00:55:35.116]  They're the patsies.
[00:55:35.116 --> 00:55:35.956]  They're the setup.
[00:55:35.956 --> 00:55:38.237]  McVeigh thinks he's part of the op.
[00:55:38.237 --> 00:55:39.858]  Then he gets drugged somehow.
[00:55:39.858 --> 00:55:42.960]  Then they get him, basically keep him drugged from that point after.
[00:55:44.995 --> 00:55:52.540]  Now, the big question is, this has been in the desert news, this has been in the Salt Lake City Tribune, both pretty good-sized papers, but that's about it.
[00:55:52.540 --> 00:55:54.401]  Oklahoma TV station covered it.
[00:55:54.401 --> 00:56:11.232]  Wouldn't it be bigger news if one of the only two convicted bombers, the only one living, who has life in prison, has no reason to do this, he will get mistreated now, who's already been told to shut up and not talk to anybody, and it's admittedly a blackout where the media can't talk to him since he wrote this letter to Ashcroft in 2004.
[00:56:11.232 --> 00:56:12.573]  Why would he go public now?
[00:56:13.971 --> 00:56:18.154]  Because he says he wants the truth to be known even if it's a great danger to his life.
[00:56:18.154 --> 00:56:22.437]  And why is it this top story on CNN and ABC News and everywhere else?
[00:56:22.437 --> 00:56:23.738]  It isn't!
[00:56:23.738 --> 00:56:29.382]  That's why you type Oklahoma bombing into Google and the top three links are PrisonPlanet.com
[00:56:30.738 --> 00:56:40.369]  Our stories are number one and now we have the unsealed portion without the exhibits, A through G, we have it up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:56:40.369 --> 00:56:46.316]  After we start the next hour and I take some calls, I'm going to go back through some of the key passages in here.
[00:56:46.316 --> 00:56:50.160]  But ask yourselves, why isn't this a top story?
[00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:51.682]  This is big news!
[00:56:52.754 --> 00:57:10.742]  That you have sworn affidavits with federal documents, and it turns out that, and I interviewed a Trinidad lawyer involved last Thursday, that some of the things he can't talk about, but that he can hint at, is that they tried to present these documents, FBI documents, in the McVeigh trial.
[00:57:10.742 --> 00:57:15.164]  Stephen Jones did, his lawyer, and was not allowed to put these documents on.
[00:57:15.164 --> 00:57:16.725]  And that's what's in the sealed exhibits.
[00:57:18.300 --> 00:57:25.987]  We're talking social security numbers, documents, funds, addresses, all of this of how this thing worked.
[00:57:25.987 --> 00:57:32.532]  And it turns out this was known the whole time, and this was blocked in the federal case from coming out.
[00:57:32.532 --> 00:57:39.518]  How they keep McVeigh quiet, drugged up, famous brainwashing doctor with him, threatened people's family, works like a charm.
[00:57:39.518 --> 00:57:41.700]  Same thing they were doing with Nichols, threatening his family.
[00:57:43.169 --> 00:57:46.112]  Now, clearly McVeigh was a prime mover in all of this.
[00:57:46.112 --> 00:57:47.793]  The classic super patsy.
[00:57:47.793 --> 00:57:54.039]  But, if you look at this, even from what the FBI admits, Nichols was a total patsy on the periphery.
[00:57:54.039 --> 00:57:56.281]  Now, I've got three pages of notes here I want to go over.
[00:57:56.281 --> 00:58:00.065]  Key points in the deposition, in the federal lawsuit filing.
[00:58:00.065 --> 00:58:03.047]  But first, we'll go to your calls when we start the second hour.
[00:58:03.047 --> 00:58:03.528]  877-590-5525 or 836-0590.
[00:58:08.758 --> 00:58:10.620]  And I really want to talk about this subject.
[00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:14.484]  We'll take calls on other subjects, if you wish, from people holding since before the show started.
[00:58:14.484 --> 00:58:16.367]  But we'll get to all of you.
[00:58:16.367 --> 00:58:17.067]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:17.067 --> 00:58:17.488]  Stay with us.
[00:58:23.161 --> 00:58:24.322]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[00:59:07.880 --> 00:59:11.643]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.

[01:01:14.418 --> 01:01:15.980]  Richard Curtis reporting.
[01:01:15.980 --> 01:01:19.162]  Residents of the Northeast are bracing for a winter storm.
[01:01:19.162 --> 01:01:22.005]  A storm that has already caused havoc in the Upper Midwest.
[01:01:22.586 --> 01:01:31.053]  National Weather Service meteorologist Mike Eckert says relief should be coming soon to the beleaguered citizens of Wisconsin, Michigan, Iowa, Indiana and other states.
[01:01:31.053 --> 01:01:41.301]  Center of low pressure is over southeastern Iowa and that low is continuing to move to the northeast, should move into the Great Lakes by Sunday night and will continue to weaken on Monday.
[01:01:41.301 --> 01:01:45.625]  Some scary moments for Vice President Dick Cheney on a flight from Sydney, Australia.
[01:01:46.284 --> 01:01:55.491]  Australian Prime Minister John Howard says Air Force Two experienced a small electrical problem.
[01:01:55.491 --> 01:01:59.073]  A spokesman for the Vice President says there was no danger.
[01:01:59.073 --> 01:02:05.658]  Iran's Foreign Minister says his country is ready for, quote, any possible option taken by America, end quote.
[01:02:05.658 --> 01:02:10.702]  The bravado comes ahead of a meeting involving the permanent members of the UN Security Council in Germany this week.
[01:02:11.326 --> 01:02:21.894]  Security Council members will be in London to talk about whether to increase sanctions on Iran following its failure to meet the February 21st deadline to end its enrichment of uranium.
[01:02:21.894 --> 01:02:24.936]  North Korea's chief nuclear negotiator plans to visit the U.S.
[01:02:24.936 --> 01:02:28.799]  within days for follow-up talks on a recent disarmament deal.
[01:02:28.799 --> 01:02:37.385]  And a massive manhunt underway now in the dense jungles of India's troubled northeastern state of Manipur after 16 policemen were killed in a terrorist ambush.
[01:02:37.385 --> 01:02:38.386]  USA Radio Network News.
[01:02:39.995 --> 01:02:43.257]  Are you stressed out and tired of trying to make ends meet?
[01:02:43.257 --> 01:02:53.423]  Would you like to find a way to earn between $500 to $7,000 or more a month working from home with a company that gives you immediate and ongoing training, marketing, and support?
[01:02:54.091 --> 01:03:04.356]  HomeVis7.com would like to give you a free work-at-home information package and DVD that will show you how you could earn a full-time income by starting with just a few hours a week.

[01:03:40.689 --> 01:03:45.911]  The Virginia General Assembly has voted unanimously to apologize for the state's role in slavery.
[01:03:45.911 --> 01:03:49.593]  It acknowledged the maltreatment of Native Americans.
[01:03:49.593 --> 01:03:55.055]  It acknowledged the wrongs of slavery and expressed profound regret for both.
[01:03:55.055 --> 01:03:57.996]  Donald McEachin is the delegate that introduced the resolution.
[01:03:58.656 --> 01:04:03.342]  Denver Broncos running back Damian Nash has died following a charity basketball game in St.
[01:04:03.342 --> 01:04:04.043]  Louis.
[01:04:04.043 --> 01:04:05.905]  The cause of death is not immediately known.
[01:04:05.905 --> 01:04:07.987]  He was 24 years old.
[01:04:07.987 --> 01:04:11.171]  Nash is the second member of the Broncos to pass away this offseason.
[01:04:11.171 --> 01:04:16.036]  Cornerback Derrent Williams was shot and killed January 1st while leaving a nightclub.
[01:04:16.036 --> 01:04:17.218]  Williams was also just 24.
[01:04:18.699 --> 01:04:23.962]  And a male jaguar has killed a zookeeper at the Denver Zoo and employees had to put the animal down.
[01:04:23.962 --> 01:04:29.025]  The six-year-old jaguar attacked the unidentified worker inside its enclosure late yesterday morning.
[01:04:29.025 --> 01:04:33.748]  Armed employees entered the enclosure to retrieve the injured woman when the cat threatened them.
[01:04:33.748 --> 01:04:37.430]  The zoo was closed after the incident, but the public was never in danger.

[01:05:10.743 --> 01:05:20.728]  The UN Children's Fund says children account for half of the estimated 120,000 people made homeless by severe flooding in central Mozambique and by Cyclone Favio.
[01:05:20.728 --> 01:05:26.011]  UNICEF spokesman Damien Persona says children are always the most vulnerable in situations of distress.
[01:05:26.011 --> 01:05:34.716]  When you have this kind of emergencies and heavy flooding, it means that the food distribution is totally disrupted.
[01:05:34.716 --> 01:05:36.577]  The lack of clean water
[01:05:37.265 --> 01:05:43.395]  And the lack of proper sanitation will, without any doubt, weaken their already weak body.
[01:05:44.549 --> 01:05:53.516]  And an Indonesian ferry that caught fire last week, killing at least 42 people, sank today as officials and journalists on board scrambled for safety.

[01:07:57.319 --> 01:07:58.440]  I'll get into that news.

[01:08:27.610 --> 01:08:28.691]  But let me just recap.
[01:08:29.728 --> 01:08:32.050]  I can't put this in words how important this story is.
[01:08:32.050 --> 01:08:39.335]  We know that the Oklahoma City bombing was an inside job, carried out to bring America into a police state and get the FBI and BATF more funding.
[01:08:39.335 --> 01:08:42.998]  We know most people in government weren't involved in it or good people.
[01:08:42.998 --> 01:08:45.420]  It's the criminals running it that are involved in it.
[01:08:45.420 --> 01:08:46.941]  And we know that McVeigh was a Patsy.
[01:08:46.941 --> 01:08:48.402]  We know there were Iraqis involved.
[01:08:48.402 --> 01:08:50.263]  We know that there were white supremacists involved.
[01:08:50.263 --> 01:08:57.849]  But as Patsy's been directed by the FBI, and now here comes the mainstream news, Nichols McVeigh had high-level help, FBI help,
[01:08:58.892 --> 01:09:12.581]  Oklahoma City bombing conspirator Terry Nichols says a high-ranking FBI official apparently was directing Timothy McVeigh and the plot to blow up a government building and might have changed the original target of the attack according to a new affidavit filed in the U.S.
[01:09:12.581 --> 01:09:14.162]  District Court in Utah.
[01:09:14.162 --> 01:09:18.966]  Salt Lake City Tribune headline, Nichols, McVeigh had high-level FBI help.
[01:09:18.966 --> 01:09:26.811]  And it goes on, the official and other conspirators are being protected by the federal government in a cover-up to escape its responsibility for the loss of life in Oklahoma.
[01:09:27.991 --> 01:09:31.892]  The evidence points towards bombs inside the government running the op.
[01:09:31.892 --> 01:09:34.493]  Others are saying, well, it was a sting gone bad.
[01:09:34.493 --> 01:09:37.074]  Yeah, where they cook the bomb and train everybody as usual.
[01:09:37.074 --> 01:09:45.777]  Documents that supposedly help back up his allegations have been sealed to protect information in them, such as social security numbers and dates of birth.
[01:09:45.777 --> 01:09:46.077]  The U.S.
[01:09:46.077 --> 01:09:48.858]  Attorney's Office in Utah had no comment on the allegations.
[01:09:48.858 --> 01:09:50.899]  The FBI and Justice Department in Washington, D.C.
[01:09:50.899 --> 01:09:51.999]  also declined comment.
[01:09:53.232 --> 01:09:58.836]  And he goes on to say, Nichols does not know the motive the government would have to be involved in the bombing.
[01:09:58.836 --> 01:10:06.842]  The affidavit was filed in a lawsuit brought by Salt Lake City attorney Jesse Trinidou, who believes his brother's death in federal prison was linked to the Oklahoma City bombing.
[01:10:06.842 --> 01:10:18.910]  The suit, which seeks documents from the FBI under the Federal Freedom of Information Act, alleges that authorities mistook Kenneth Trinidou for a bombing conspirator, who they also tortured to death and hung, and that guards killed him in an interrogation that got out of hand.
[01:10:19.918 --> 01:10:23.862]  And it goes on from there, and that's how he got involved in this.
[01:10:23.862 --> 01:10:26.965]  Now, they were able to see the documents before they were sealed.
[01:10:26.965 --> 01:10:36.273]  We now have gotten the documents when they were unsealed, minus, and we're the only people that have these now, now you can get them at PrisonPlanet.com, minus the exhibits.
[01:10:36.273 --> 01:10:43.540]  He went back to the judge and got the basic filing unsealed, and we have that up on the website for you right now.
[01:10:44.395 --> 01:10:47.576]  This is so important, but here is the desert news.
[01:10:47.576 --> 01:11:01.681]  The most shocking allegation in the 19-page signed declaration is that Nichols' assertion that the whole bombing plot was an FBI operation and that McVey let slip during a bout of anger that he was taking instruction from former FBI official Larry Potts.
[01:11:01.681 --> 01:11:03.682]  And going back to the Salt Lake City
[01:11:04.392 --> 01:11:11.854]  Tribune article, McVeigh told him, Nichols, he was recruited for underground missions while serving in the military, according to Nichols.
[01:11:11.854 --> 01:11:17.436]  He says he learned sometime in 95 that there had been a change in the bombing target, and that McVeigh was very upset about that.
[01:11:17.436 --> 01:11:20.517]  It just goes on and on and on.
[01:11:20.517 --> 01:11:28.259]  And the big news here is, this has been in two newspapers and on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com, has even been on the front page of Google News.
[01:11:28.259 --> 01:11:29.920]  If you type in Oklahoma City bombing, it's the
[01:11:30.732 --> 01:11:38.158]  Our stories are number one, meaning they're getting the most visitors, and it's being accepted by Google as news to go through a vetting process, because they went and researched it.
[01:11:38.158 --> 01:11:42.441]  It's been one of the number one stories on dig.com, which is like 54 on the web.
[01:11:42.441 --> 01:11:43.462]  It was 55 last week.
[01:11:43.462 --> 01:11:47.205]  I'll give you an idea, Drudge is like 500 and something in ranking.
[01:11:47.205 --> 01:11:54.810]  This is a huge story in the underground media, which is now becoming the dominant media, because mainstream media refuses to report on this.
[01:11:54.810 --> 01:11:58.073]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tony in Arlington.
[01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:00.544]  And you're on the air.
[01:12:00.544 --> 01:12:02.349]  Thanks for holding.
[01:12:02.349 --> 01:12:03.853]  Hey Alex, where do I start?
[01:12:03.853 --> 01:12:04.515]  Man, I'm sick.
[01:12:06.381 --> 01:12:11.084]  Well, it's a good thing the mainstream media is covering important stories like, you know, Brittany shaving her head.
[01:12:11.084 --> 01:12:12.405]  Oh, that's the cover of Newsweek.
[01:12:12.405 --> 01:12:13.765]  I was in a grocery store this morning.
[01:12:13.765 --> 01:12:16.687]  It's Girls Gone Bad, Girls Gone Wild.
[01:12:16.687 --> 01:12:18.188]  Oh my, this is so important.
[01:12:18.188 --> 01:12:19.049]  Anna Nicole Smith.
[01:12:19.049 --> 01:12:20.050]  Who cares?
[01:12:20.050 --> 01:12:21.911]  Yeah, isn't that great?
[01:12:21.911 --> 01:12:23.992]  A couple questions quickly, Alex.
[01:12:23.992 --> 01:12:28.896]  Well, let me just ask you, because I just spent an hour not taking calls, trying to condense it all down.
[01:12:28.896 --> 01:12:30.637]  I mean, could you follow that?
[01:12:30.637 --> 01:12:31.998]  I mean, was that put together well?
[01:12:32.845 --> 01:12:33.685]  It was very cogent.
[01:12:33.685 --> 01:12:35.186]  No, it was very well put together.
[01:12:35.186 --> 01:12:37.367]  This is such a big issue!
[01:12:37.367 --> 01:12:38.708]  Well, here's the thing.
[01:12:38.708 --> 01:12:42.649]  It's not working in the St.
[01:12:42.649 --> 01:12:44.570]  Philip's City Tribune.
[01:12:44.570 --> 01:12:55.635]  My question is, when or how do you think the smoking gun evidence, the part of the lead is sealed, do you think that will ever see the light of day in the mainstream media?
[01:12:55.635 --> 01:12:59.857]  The second thing is, if it does, do you see this as a possible watershed?
[01:13:00.991 --> 01:13:01.972]  OKC was bad enough.
[01:13:01.972 --> 01:13:05.553]  I'm not diminishing that, and I'm certainly not diminishing your work here.
[01:13:05.553 --> 01:13:12.656]  But it points towards 9-11, and if we can prove OKC was an inside job, then the logical extension is 9-11.
[01:13:12.656 --> 01:13:13.137]  Well, yeah.
[01:13:13.137 --> 01:13:17.178]  I mean, A leads to B, and if they can do that, what can't they do?
[01:13:17.178 --> 01:13:18.939]  What won't a rat do at that point?
[01:13:18.939 --> 01:13:21.100]  Well, let's go back to what you said earlier.
[01:13:23.444 --> 01:13:25.646]  You know, basically, uh, will this break?
[01:13:25.646 --> 01:13:26.346]  Will this come out?
[01:13:26.346 --> 01:13:26.667]  Yeah.
[01:13:26.667 --> 01:13:35.153]  There have been three separate lawsuits by insurance companies and others, and the feds would never release the surveillance video of the bombing happening.
[01:13:35.153 --> 01:13:49.345]  And we have newscasts, the documents, it's all in Road to Tyranny, where people can go to Google Video, type in The Road to Tyranny, watch my film for free, you can buy it on DVD, and InfoWars.com if you want, but don't let that stop you, go watch it for free, and you'll see all the newscasts, you'll witness it all,
[01:13:50.194 --> 01:13:51.455]  For yourselves.
[01:13:51.455 --> 01:13:52.935]  I mean, this is admitted.
[01:13:52.935 --> 01:13:58.137]  So we have FBI agents who went public and said, yeah, it's McVeigh with these Arabs.
[01:13:58.137 --> 01:13:58.358]  Okay?
[01:13:58.358 --> 01:14:02.239]  And that fits in, and we know that they were there, but we know they were on federal payroll.
[01:14:02.239 --> 01:14:03.760]  This is all part of these black ops.
[01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:06.861]  So no, I don't think they're going to release these sealed documents.
[01:14:06.861 --> 01:14:11.363]  The problem is, is that some lawyers out there have them, and who knows if they're going to be servicing.
[01:14:11.363 --> 01:14:12.844]  Well, I'm just livid, Alex.
[01:14:12.844 --> 01:14:14.965]  I started this, you know, after 9-11.
[01:14:14.965 --> 01:14:16.085]  I was a skeptic, quite honestly.
[01:14:16.085 --> 01:14:16.625]  I heard of you.
[01:14:16.625 --> 01:14:17.466]  I visited your website.
[01:14:17.466 --> 01:14:17.866]  I said, nah.
[01:14:18.664 --> 01:14:19.445]  Just another kook.
[01:14:19.445 --> 01:14:20.265]  Well, you know what?
[01:14:20.265 --> 01:14:23.306]  I did some research on my own, and I'm college educated.
[01:14:23.306 --> 01:14:31.331]  I've got a background that, you know, I'm very interested in 9-11 for personal reasons, and I've seen the light.
[01:14:31.331 --> 01:14:37.654]  I mean, you can't deny certain things, and I'll let you go, but I just wanted to say if there's any way this can see the light of day and
[01:14:38.450 --> 01:14:43.335]  And hit the mainstream news just for a day or two, maybe it'll wake some more folks up.
[01:14:43.335 --> 01:14:44.155]  I hear you.
[01:14:44.155 --> 01:14:45.877]  I mean, frankly, I've got a family.
[01:14:45.877 --> 01:14:46.738]  I enjoy my life.
[01:14:46.738 --> 01:14:49.060]  I don't even like covering issues like this.
[01:14:49.060 --> 01:14:51.262]  This is dangerous, folks.
[01:14:51.262 --> 01:14:53.844]  And, I mean, I'm here witnessing all this.
[01:14:53.844 --> 01:14:54.865]  I'm here covering this.
[01:14:54.865 --> 01:14:59.489]  Trinidad comes on the show and says, yeah, you really broke this three years ago.
[01:14:59.489 --> 01:15:01.091]  We laid this out a long time before that.
[01:15:01.975 --> 01:15:03.697]  And, uh, but they killed those people.
[01:15:03.697 --> 01:15:05.618]  They killed those children in that daycare.
[01:15:05.618 --> 01:15:09.541]  They did it to turn America into a police state, and somebody's got to stand up.
[01:15:09.541 --> 01:15:11.043]  Somebody's got to fight this.
[01:15:11.043 --> 01:15:13.765]  Let's go ahead and talk to Robert in Austin.
[01:15:13.765 --> 01:15:15.546]  Robert, you're on the air.
[01:15:15.546 --> 01:15:17.007]  Yes, Alex, how's it going?
[01:15:17.007 --> 01:15:18.509]  Good.
[01:15:18.509 --> 01:15:27.536]  Uh, about the OKC thing, I have a question later, but first, on FoxNews.com today, if you go to the latest news, you'll see
[01:15:28.072 --> 01:15:30.894]  Smart cams do flag suspicious behavior.
[01:15:30.894 --> 01:15:38.838]  Yeah, they're going to put cameras in all of the backs of the seats just to watch your every movement on the airplanes with computers analyzing it.
[01:15:38.838 --> 01:15:41.579]  It's more fraud than the lie detector ever was.
[01:15:41.579 --> 01:15:43.480]  It's just an excuse to totally surveil us.
[01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:44.381]  Let me give you one new.
[01:15:44.381 --> 01:15:47.182]  They're going to put them in all the new cars, but go ahead.
[01:15:47.182 --> 01:15:49.223]  Okay, get this.
[01:15:49.223 --> 01:15:50.404]  This is from the article.
[01:15:50.404 --> 01:15:52.605]  Surveillance cameras are common in many cities.
[01:15:53.204 --> 01:15:55.145]  Well, that's right.
[01:15:55.145 --> 01:16:00.428]  The Houston Police Chief, and I'm not making this up, was in the Associated Press last year.
[01:16:15.723 --> 01:16:19.185]  Just type into Google, Houston Police Chief wants cameras in homes.
[01:16:19.185 --> 01:16:21.366]  And they didn't say criminals' homes, that's how it'll start.
[01:16:21.366 --> 01:16:24.607]  No, everybody's house needs cameras with the police watching you.
[01:16:24.607 --> 01:16:28.349]  Sir, they put cameras in thousands of school bathrooms.
[01:16:28.349 --> 01:16:38.554]  Okay, I remember eight years ago, almost nine years ago, in 1999, I guess eight years ago, seeing the Associated Press report that in Michigan they put them in the stalls in highway stops.
[01:16:39.114 --> 01:16:45.418]  I mean, again, it's 1984, you've got a decadent, dumbed-down public that has no idea what's being set up.
[01:16:45.418 --> 01:16:48.720]  Quickly, you're OK, C-Common, I've got to go to break.
[01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:58.327]  Yes, I was wondering, you've talked about this before, but the results of the bombing, was there any legislation passed, or did they try to pass anything, or is it just sort of a tie-off?
[01:16:58.327 --> 01:16:59.067]  Yes.
[01:16:59.067 --> 01:17:00.408]  Let me break that down when we get back.
[01:17:00.408 --> 01:17:01.329]  I appreciate your call.
[01:17:01.329 --> 01:17:03.230]  Stay with us, more calls, more news, straight ahead.
[01:17:08.286 --> 01:17:09.787]  Hey Jane, how's it going?
[01:17:09.787 --> 01:17:11.929]  Gosh, I'm not doing so well.
[01:17:11.929 --> 01:17:16.432]  Even though I'm doing everything I'm supposed to do, my blood sugar is way out of control.
[01:17:16.432 --> 01:17:18.353]  Oh Jane, I'm sorry to hear that.
[01:17:18.353 --> 01:17:20.654]  I have to monitor my blood sugar again.
[01:17:20.654 --> 01:17:26.078]  If there was only something natural I could take that would help control my blood sugar, that really works.
[01:17:26.078 --> 01:17:27.439]  Have you tried sucroblast?
[01:17:28.211 --> 01:17:33.853]  For millions of Americans who can't keep their high blood sugar levels off their minds, there's Sucroblast.
[01:17:33.853 --> 01:17:38.755]  Sucroblast is the all-natural way to help keep your high blood sugar levels under control.
[01:17:38.755 --> 01:17:43.277]  For a limited time, you can get a free consultation from a Sucroblast specialist.
[01:17:43.277 --> 01:17:46.058]  Call 1-800-99-HEALTHY.
[01:17:46.058 --> 01:17:48.839]  That's 1-800-99-HEALTHY.
[01:17:48.839 --> 01:17:53.021]  Or visit them on the web at MyBloodSugarBreakthrough.com.
[01:17:53.021 --> 01:17:54.742]  That's MyBloodSugarBreakthrough.com.
[01:17:56.528 --> 01:17:57.948]  So, Jane, what do you think?
[01:17:57.948 --> 01:18:02.129]  I'm going to call Sucroblast to set up a free consultation right now!
[01:18:02.129 --> 01:18:03.009]  Excellent, Jane.
[01:18:03.009 --> 01:18:06.590]  He'll be glad you did.
[01:18:06.590 --> 01:18:07.590]  Ted Anders for Midas.
[01:18:07.590 --> 01:18:08.010]  February 23, 2007.
[01:18:08.010 --> 01:18:08.510]  Gold 683, 10 ounce.
[01:18:08.510 --> 01:18:10.311]  Gold coins are at 70492, 35501 for half, 17748 for quarter ounce.
[01:18:10.311 --> 01:18:10.571]  That's 70492, 35501, 17748.
[01:18:21.613 --> 01:18:34.839]  On June 4th, 1963, an unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11110, was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government and interest.
[01:18:34.839 --> 01:18:38.200]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:41.742]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[01:18:41.742 --> 01:18:44.743]  However, the Executive Order still stands unrepealed.
[01:18:45.023 --> 01:18:47.986]  Midas has the Kennedy vs. Fed document.
[01:18:47.986 --> 01:18:48.507]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:18:48.507 --> 01:18:53.473]  Unlike your liberty, the paper is free.
[01:18:53.473 --> 01:18:56.556]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:18:56.556 --> 01:19:00.481]  If you're interested in breaking the bondage of taxation and debt, call 800-686-2237.
[01:19:00.481 --> 01:19:00.661]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:19:10.305 --> 01:19:16.148]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:19:16.148 --> 01:19:23.771]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:19:24.474 --> 01:19:31.918]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:19:31.918 --> 01:19:43.665]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:19:43.665 --> 01:19:47.627]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:19:47.627 --> 01:19:49.889]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:19:49.889 --> 01:19:53.731]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[01:19:54.306 --> 01:20:07.249]  Get your copy today on InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:20:07.249 --> 01:20:09.110]  Government is best, which governs least.
[01:20:09.110 --> 01:20:10.390]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[01:20:10.390 --> 01:20:13.791]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:20:13.791 --> 01:20:16.512]  What part of unconstitutional do not understand, George?
[01:20:17.097 --> 01:20:24.387]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[01:20:53.578 --> 01:20:53.998]  Call 877-873-9626.
[01:20:53.998 --> 01:20:54.198]  That's 877-873-9626.
[01:20:54.198 --> 01:20:55.598]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:20:55.598 --> 01:20:56.539]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:21:18.476 --> 01:21:20.377]  Raging for the truth.
[01:21:20.377 --> 01:21:22.437]  Exposing corruption.
[01:21:22.437 --> 01:21:26.118]  Dismantling the false left-right paradigm.
[01:21:26.118 --> 01:21:31.659]  He's Alex Jones.
[01:21:31.659 --> 01:21:44.843]  All right, I just typed into Google Oklahoma bombing into the news, into their news area, and it says KTEN-TV at Oklahoma City did report on an Oklahoma City bombing
[01:21:46.286 --> 01:21:51.171]  Conspirator Terry Nichols now claims a former top official of the FBI was behind the bombing plot.
[01:21:51.171 --> 01:21:57.758]  Nichols says in a statement from a federal lawsuit that bomber Timothy McVeigh identified Deputy FBI Director Larry Potts as the man directing the scheme.
[01:21:58.596 --> 01:22:05.339]  And it's just Potts says the claim is nonsense and ridiculous and the FBI calls Nichols' allegations completely without any factual basis.
[01:22:05.339 --> 01:22:06.760]  But then the story continues.
[01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:11.962]  Nichols' statement gives no explanation why an FBI official would want a federal building bombed.
[01:22:11.962 --> 01:22:16.884]  Why would Hitler, when he was German Chancellor, want to bomb his own capital building?
[01:22:16.884 --> 01:22:22.387]  To have total control and scare the people into submission and get more funding and set up the Third Reich!
[01:22:22.387 --> 01:22:25.028]  That's why, two months after being elected on February 27th,
[01:22:26.292 --> 01:22:27.433]  1933, he did that.
[01:22:27.433 --> 01:22:28.913]  That's why it's now declassified.
[01:22:28.913 --> 01:22:33.516]  Our government staged the Gulf of Tonkin attack to kick off Vietnam in 1964.
[01:22:33.516 --> 01:22:35.017]  That's why our government's declassified.
[01:22:35.017 --> 01:22:39.059]  Hundreds of other examples of where they've staged terror attacks overseas to blame it on foreign enemies.
[01:22:39.059 --> 01:22:42.861]  In fact, I have the Times of London today in one other mainstream news article.
[01:22:42.861 --> 01:22:44.262]  In fact, where is that?
[01:22:44.262 --> 01:22:46.343]  It's in my big stack here.
[01:22:46.343 --> 01:22:46.943]  I had that.
[01:22:46.943 --> 01:22:49.364]  Oh, here's a London Telegraph on it.
[01:22:49.364 --> 01:22:49.745]  U.S.
[01:22:49.745 --> 01:22:52.226]  funds terror groups to sow chaos in Iran.
[01:22:52.958 --> 01:22:55.601]  And they've got terror groups running around blowing stuff up.
[01:22:55.601 --> 01:22:56.702]  Oh, here, right here!
[01:22:56.702 --> 01:22:57.443]  Here today!
[01:22:57.443 --> 01:22:58.704]  This is today!
[01:22:58.704 --> 01:22:59.645]  How many more articles?
[01:22:59.645 --> 01:23:01.327]  It's just constant!
[01:23:01.327 --> 01:23:03.830]  Stop being so not naive out there!
[01:23:03.830 --> 01:23:06.052]  The cameras in the bathroom are for our safety.
[01:23:06.052 --> 01:23:07.634]  I think the Houston police chief's right.
[01:23:07.634 --> 01:23:09.516]  We need cameras in our houses.
[01:23:09.516 --> 01:23:10.958]  But the border needs to be wide open.
[01:23:12.819 --> 01:23:13.840]  I said I'd go to your calls.
[01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:17.002]  You know, the callers are pretty much asking the same question.
[01:23:17.002 --> 01:23:19.044]  Will the big national media cover this?
[01:23:19.044 --> 01:23:20.845]  Will more documents ever come out?
[01:23:20.845 --> 01:23:26.770]  It doesn't even matter if they do, at a certain level, because most people won't even go read it, and the media will ignore it.
[01:23:26.770 --> 01:23:28.411]  But over time, people are waking up.
[01:23:28.411 --> 01:23:31.573]  We can't wait 40 years or something like Gulf of Tonkin, though.
[01:23:31.573 --> 01:23:33.215]  This needs to come out now, and it is.
[01:23:35.874 --> 01:23:42.421]  I swore a long time ago to fight the globalists and find out the truth, and I found out OKC was an inside job months after it happened.
[01:23:42.421 --> 01:23:49.028]  I was watching local access TV, and somebody here locally had gone and gotten the newscast and put them all together.
[01:23:49.028 --> 01:23:52.691]  I was watching like two hours of newscast, but back-to-back, there they are taking the bombs out.
[01:23:52.691 --> 01:23:53.172]  The bombs.
[01:23:53.172 --> 01:23:54.113]  Look at the pillars shattered.
[01:23:54.113 --> 01:23:54.994]  The bombs inside.
[01:23:54.994 --> 01:23:57.977]  Police going, yo, the BATF was here seconds after it happened.
[01:23:58.718 --> 01:24:03.060]  BATF's on video going, we were told not to come in our pagers.
[01:24:03.060 --> 01:24:04.721]  See, they weren't involved, those people.
[01:24:04.721 --> 01:24:06.843]  They were warned not to come in their pagers.
[01:24:06.843 --> 01:24:08.604]  This is real stuff!
[01:24:08.604 --> 01:24:10.845]  We're not saying they're all terrorists.
[01:24:10.845 --> 01:24:12.766]  I don't even know if Larry Potts really did this.
[01:24:12.766 --> 01:24:15.187]  This could be some elaborate disinfo.
[01:24:15.187 --> 01:24:18.329]  We're just here reporting this and covering this.
[01:24:20.165 --> 01:24:22.746]  And listen, it's admitted there's a cover-up.
[01:24:22.746 --> 01:24:37.392]  It's admitted he went directly to Ashcroft in 2004, Larry Nichols did, with all these documents, and it turns out it was in the trial, in the late 90s, there in Denver, and it turns out all this got covered under national security.
[01:24:37.392 --> 01:24:45.476]  And now the media tried to get in to interview Nichols for years, and they wouldn't let the media, but a lawyer was able to get in, because you can't block lawyers.
[01:24:45.476 --> 01:24:46.456]  This is the bottom line.
[01:24:47.695 --> 01:24:50.896]  Let's go ahead and talk to Lewis in New Jersey.
[01:24:50.896 --> 01:24:54.917]  Lewis, you're on the air, then we'll go to Kevin and others.
[01:24:54.917 --> 01:24:58.377]  Lewis, thank you for holding her on the air worldwide.
[01:24:58.377 --> 01:25:00.638]  Thanks for having me, Alex.
[01:25:00.638 --> 01:25:16.021]  I just wanted to let you know that, like you said, there are mountains of evidence proving our situation concerning Oklahoma City and the New World Order overall, their crimes, and I wanted to just encourage you that
[01:25:16.964 --> 01:25:18.781]  That we need to focus on the solutions.
[01:25:19.412 --> 01:25:22.373]  That we have at our disposal.
[01:25:22.373 --> 01:25:30.175]  Well, the biggest solution right now is waking up the generally dumb public that can't find Iraq on a map, but will form some policy in their head.
[01:25:30.175 --> 01:25:42.758]  You know, the answer is exposing the New World Orders, gun control, their open borders, their North American Union, how they stage terror, how the environmental groups predominantly are nothing but a bunch of land grabbers for global corporations.
[01:25:42.758 --> 01:25:47.739]  You know, I'm here hitting the key, and I believe the solution is going to every hill and mountain and
[01:25:49.159 --> 01:25:52.002]  Crying from the rooftops that this stuff's going on.
[01:25:52.002 --> 01:25:52.783]  And it is working.
[01:25:52.783 --> 01:25:54.184]  We are waking people up.
[01:25:54.184 --> 01:25:54.685]  Definitely.
[01:25:54.685 --> 01:26:04.975]  And I just want to comment on my delight at seeing the effect of stories like this on the alternative media and its position.
[01:26:04.975 --> 01:26:09.700]  And I just wanted to ask your opinion in connection with all of this.
[01:26:09.700 --> 01:26:11.922]  You know, we know that they carry out these crimes.
[01:26:12.384 --> 01:26:16.248]  And I recently learned that, you know, as far as I can tell, the U.S.
[01:26:16.248 --> 01:26:18.950]  is actually a private corporation at this point.
[01:26:18.950 --> 01:26:20.191]  A private corporation.
[01:26:20.191 --> 01:26:22.453]  This is officially registered in 1913.
[01:26:22.453 --> 01:26:27.678]  The Federal Reserve registered the District of Columbia and the District
[01:26:28.479 --> 01:26:32.742]  ...was then expanded to be the corporate rulers of this country.
[01:26:32.742 --> 01:26:40.068]  They then began abolishing all the original constitutional powers to the legitimate federal government and the states, okay?
[01:26:40.068 --> 01:26:46.553]  And then from that point, they began giving new powers into the new corporate system and administrative law judges.
[01:26:46.553 --> 01:26:57.562]  So they created a parallel shadow government, then started erasing the real government, and then now are announcing the shadow government as the legitimate government and claiming the constitutional government is illegitimate.
[01:26:58.227 --> 01:26:58.913]  Does that make sense?
[01:26:59.904 --> 01:27:01.985]  Let's go ahead, and I appreciate your great questions, sir.
[01:27:01.985 --> 01:27:02.525]  They're excellent.
[01:27:02.525 --> 01:27:11.307]  Yes, the District of Criminals, the District of Columbia, is a private corporation, and it is registered in Puerto Rico, and it's basically owned by the Bank of England.
[01:27:11.307 --> 01:27:12.227]  Go research it.
[01:27:12.227 --> 01:27:13.448]  Private shareholders.
[01:27:13.448 --> 01:27:15.128]  It's come out in mainstream news now.
[01:27:15.128 --> 01:27:17.569]  It's just part of the insane asylum we live in.
[01:27:17.569 --> 01:27:22.650]  It's part of just the total fakeness, the stageness of almost everything we see, but it's there.
[01:27:22.650 --> 01:27:24.751]  The truth is there if you want to find out about it.
[01:27:24.751 --> 01:27:26.912]  Let's go ahead and talk to Kevin in Kansas.
[01:27:26.912 --> 01:27:27.252]  Welcome.
[01:27:27.252 --> 01:27:28.312]  You're on the air worldwide.
[01:27:29.192 --> 01:27:30.353]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[01:27:30.353 --> 01:27:37.237]  I'm out here in Manhattan, Kansas, and I just wanted to let you know that good ol' Bill Clinton's gonna be out here to give one of his speeches.
[01:27:37.237 --> 01:27:47.003]  Well, Barack Obama came to town Friday, and I took the day off to be with family, but my crew and other great folks went out there and confronted him, and the local 9-11 troopers got signs up saying, Investigate 9-11.
[01:27:47.003 --> 01:27:49.945]  9-11's an inside job, and look at those photos.
[01:27:49.945 --> 01:27:51.946]  Huge signs took over the whole event.
[01:27:51.946 --> 01:27:54.288]  You can go look at those at jonesreport.com, but go ahead.
[01:27:55.396 --> 01:28:00.940]  No, it would just be great if there would be some like-minded people out here to want to fight the New World Order, but it's kind of hard.
[01:28:00.940 --> 01:28:07.685]  I'm kind of in the rut of the neocons out here in Manhattan, Kansas, so it's kind of hard to break through to people.
[01:28:07.685 --> 01:28:14.589]  I hand out your films to some of my college professors and hand some out to the students, but people out here, I mean, it is just totally 1984.
[01:28:14.589 --> 01:28:18.132]  Yeah, but you know, five years ago, it was like that everywhere I went.
[01:28:18.132 --> 01:28:22.255]  Now, everywhere I go, the majority are awake, so just keep working, keep planting your seeds.
[01:28:22.255 --> 01:28:22.675]  Anything else?
[01:28:23.760 --> 01:28:38.129]  No, I just want to say if there's anybody that's in Manhattan and they want to go protest and Bill Clinton comes down and into town, maybe we can shine light to some of these new Oklahoma City... Yeah, because you told the folks that answered the phone, it says Oklahoma City and Bill Clinton.
[01:28:38.129 --> 01:28:40.951]  I mean, maybe go confront Clinton about that.
[01:28:40.951 --> 01:28:42.512]  That'd be great.
[01:28:42.512 --> 01:28:43.173]  That'd be nice.
[01:28:43.173 --> 01:28:49.837]  I just was calling to see if there's any like-minded people that are out here in Manhattan that would like to go do that with me.
[01:28:49.837 --> 01:28:51.458]  Do you have an email or something?
[01:28:51.966 --> 01:28:55.048]  Yeah, kdb at ksu dot edu.
[01:28:55.048 --> 01:28:55.889]  Alright, bro.
[01:28:55.889 --> 01:28:56.909]  I appreciate it.
[01:28:56.909 --> 01:28:58.811]  Let's go ahead and talk to James in Indiana.
[01:28:58.811 --> 01:28:59.371]  You're on the air.
[01:28:59.371 --> 01:29:00.392]  Go ahead, James.
[01:29:00.392 --> 01:29:00.972]  Yeah, Alex.
[01:29:00.972 --> 01:29:03.374]  I want to talk about the motive for the Oklahoma City bombing.
[01:29:03.374 --> 01:29:03.754]  Okay.
[01:29:03.754 --> 01:29:04.754]  Very important.
[01:29:04.754 --> 01:29:07.056]  I've heard you say a couple of times about funding.
[01:29:07.957 --> 01:29:15.143]  The omnibus crime bill had failed six months before, and they got it to sail through right after the bombing.
[01:29:15.143 --> 01:29:19.126]  Okay, I kind of agree with you, but I disagree with you more, because I think the motive is bigger than that.
[01:29:19.126 --> 01:29:21.447]  I think the motive was... That was only one part of it.
[01:29:21.447 --> 01:29:21.848]  Yeah.
[01:29:21.848 --> 01:29:26.351]  Demonized the constitutional patriot militia movement that was exploding at the time.
[01:29:26.351 --> 01:29:27.211]  Yeah.
[01:29:27.211 --> 01:29:33.276]  There was the Patriot Movement, a strong Patriot Movement, because if you remember the times, the biggest image of the government at the time was the Patriot Movement.
[01:29:33.743 --> 01:29:41.265]  And it was gaining momentum with Ruby Ridge, the disaster there, and Waco... Oh, listen, there were... Listen, the Oklahoma Statehouse... Stay there, I'm going to put you on hold, okay?
[01:29:41.265 --> 01:29:43.785]  I want you to be able to finish up.
[01:29:43.785 --> 01:29:48.086]  The Oklahoma Statehouse was about to pass an amendment against the U.N.
[01:29:48.086 --> 01:29:49.587]  at the state level to start the U.N.
[01:29:49.587 --> 01:29:50.827]  pullout with a U.N.
[01:29:50.827 --> 01:29:51.807]  free zone.
[01:29:51.807 --> 01:29:53.827]  You're absolutely on target with that.
[01:29:53.827 --> 01:29:56.588]  PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com are the websites.
[01:29:56.588 --> 01:29:59.969]  More calls and North American Union news on the other side as well.
[01:29:59.969 --> 01:30:00.369]  Stay with us.
[01:30:03.170 --> 01:30:03.372]  Yeah.
[01:30:07.080 --> 01:30:10.062]  Attention, this is an urgent GCN News Bulletin.
[01:30:10.062 --> 01:30:12.363]  Do you desperately need to get out of debt fast?
[01:30:12.363 --> 01:30:15.325]  Would you like to make some of your debts disappear completely?
[01:30:15.325 --> 01:30:19.808]  If so, and you're a GCN listener, there's a very real chance that you'll now be able to do it.
[01:30:19.808 --> 01:30:20.409]  Here's why.
[01:30:20.409 --> 01:30:27.333]  A new manual has just been published that reveals how you can get out of debt in 90 minutes without any loans or bankruptcy whatsoever.
[01:30:27.333 --> 01:30:33.757]  The insider secrets revealed allow you to get out of debt so fast and so completely that it makes some people feel like they're cheating, but they're not.
[01:30:33.937 --> 01:30:37.901]  The secrets taught in the manual are 100% legal and 100% ethical.
[01:30:37.901 --> 01:30:42.606]  It's just that bankers, debt collectors, and credit card companies don't want you to know about these loopholes.
[01:30:42.606 --> 01:30:49.774]  Learn how to finally teach those financial vultures some humility by beating them at their own game, and above all, learn how to bail out for a soft landing.
[01:30:50.214 --> 01:30:51.054]  Get control.
[01:30:51.054 --> 01:30:51.854]  Get relief.
[01:30:51.854 --> 01:30:52.895]  Get some sleep.
[01:30:52.895 --> 01:30:53.955]  Go to www.outand90.com.
[01:30:53.955 --> 01:30:54.975]  That's www.outand90.com.
[01:30:54.975 --> 01:30:55.675]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[01:30:55.675 --> 01:30:55.955]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:30:55.955 --> 01:30:56.216]  Hello?
[01:30:56.216 --> 01:30:56.636]  Hey, it's me.
[01:30:56.636 --> 01:30:57.816]  I got something, man, I want you to look at.
[01:30:57.816 --> 01:30:57.916]  What?
[01:30:57.916 --> 01:30:58.416]  What is it now?
[01:30:58.416 --> 01:30:59.336]  It's called OneYearToRetire.net.
[01:31:18.777 --> 01:31:21.700]  When you get home, I want you to go to OneYearToRetire.net.
[01:31:21.700 --> 01:31:23.402]  Come on, you gotta be kidding.
[01:31:23.402 --> 01:31:24.723]  One year to retire?
[01:31:24.723 --> 01:31:27.806]  When are you gonna get it through your head that there is no quick fix?
[01:31:27.806 --> 01:31:29.048]  No free lunch?
[01:31:29.048 --> 01:31:29.688]  I know.
[01:31:29.688 --> 01:31:30.569]  I agree with you.
[01:31:30.569 --> 01:31:32.091]  This isn't like that.
[01:31:32.091 --> 01:31:35.734]  It's an ingenious system that's designed to help you retire in one year.
[01:31:35.734 --> 01:31:41.180]  I was skeptical too, but the system is free, and when I looked at it, I was sure it would work.
[01:31:41.829 --> 01:31:42.730]  What have you got to lose?
[01:31:42.730 --> 01:31:43.670]  It's free.
[01:31:43.670 --> 01:31:49.255]  Well... All you have to do is go to OneYearToRetire.net and get a free system.
[01:31:49.255 --> 01:31:50.455]  It only takes a minute.
[01:31:50.455 --> 01:31:53.278]  You've got nothing to lose and everything to gain.
[01:31:53.278 --> 01:31:55.699]  Go to OneYearToRetire.net.
[01:31:55.699 --> 01:31:58.441]  That's OneYearToRetire.net.
[01:31:58.441 --> 01:31:58.982]  Or call 888-200-0265.
[01:31:58.982 --> 01:31:59.222]  That's 888-200-0265.
[01:32:06.895 --> 01:32:12.946]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[01:32:12.946 --> 01:32:16.152]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big business and the American economy.
[01:32:18.336 --> 01:32:18.656]  We're good to go.
[01:32:43.687 --> 01:32:44.568]  We're good to go.
[01:33:07.739 --> 01:33:10.460]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[01:33:10.460 --> 01:33:12.902]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[01:33:12.902 --> 01:33:23.307]  I mean the hard to find kind that's all natural and not full of corrosive toxins and chemicals and detergents that just dry out your skin and have been connected to very serious health problems?
[01:33:23.307 --> 01:33:25.648]  Let me tell you something about the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company.

[01:34:10.304 --> 01:34:12.765]  Are you tired of searching for great talk radio?
[01:34:12.765 --> 01:34:14.025]  Well, search no more.
[01:34:14.025 --> 01:34:18.646]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[01:34:18.646 --> 01:34:21.627]  Corruption never had a worse enemy.
[01:34:21.627 --> 01:34:24.688]  You're locked into the Alex Jones Show.
[01:34:29.071 --> 01:34:30.673]  Welcome back, my friends.
[01:34:30.673 --> 01:34:34.598]  Continuing with your phone calls at 877-590-5525, 877-590-KLBJ, or locally, 836-059 if you're listening in Central Texas.
[01:34:34.598 --> 01:34:35.819]  Continuing with your calls.
[01:34:35.819 --> 01:34:37.201]  Going back to James in Indiana.
[01:34:50.237 --> 01:34:51.679]  James thinks they had a different motive.
[01:34:51.679 --> 01:34:54.041]  No, I hadn't elaborated, sir.
[01:34:54.041 --> 01:34:58.045]  Obviously, the militia movement was exploding, but the mainline patriot movement was exploding.
[01:34:58.045 --> 01:35:01.509]  Bill Clinton, you know, the news, FBI agents had quit.
[01:35:01.509 --> 01:35:04.151]  He worked at the White House and got public about their first day at work.
[01:35:04.151 --> 01:35:08.496]  Everybody was wearing red linen pins and there were crack pipes on the Christmas tree.
[01:35:09.551 --> 01:35:10.391]  Yeah, that's exactly right.
[01:35:10.391 --> 01:35:11.212]  And McVeigh wanted to get caught.
[01:35:11.212 --> 01:35:16.253]  And it was what McVeigh represented was the motive for the bombing, the main one, in my opinion.
[01:35:40.015 --> 01:35:48.838]  If you're going to, look, you're not going to take off the license plate of your car right before you commit a horrible, you know, giant terrorist act.
[01:35:48.838 --> 01:35:52.480]  And that's in Nichols' recent file that you have on your website.
[01:35:53.844 --> 01:36:02.866]  Yeah, that he didn't know why at the rental space that McVeigh had when he went there later to try to get rid of evidence when he learned what had happened, that the license plate and a hand grenade was there.
[01:36:02.866 --> 01:36:16.408]  Right, he took off the license plate of his car, that's why he got pulled over, because he was speeding away from the bombing and a car with a license plate on it, while he was fully armed and wearing a t-shirt, saying, basically, I'm a Patriot militia guy, and he had, for some reason, I don't know why he would do this.
[01:36:16.408 --> 01:36:18.548]  A gun on the dashboard.
[01:36:18.548 --> 01:36:22.949]  Yes, he had a gun loaded, and he had two pages of the Trinidadaries photocopied.
[01:36:23.567 --> 01:36:25.867]  That was talking about a bombing against the government.
[01:36:25.867 --> 01:36:32.129]  Bernard Irish was, you know, the... They could throw that on him, but that was... Written by Dr. William Pierce.
[01:36:32.129 --> 01:36:32.709]  Absolutely.
[01:36:32.709 --> 01:36:37.130]  Very educated caller on all the... And this is all the little pieces of the puzzle.
[01:36:37.130 --> 01:36:40.170]  And then you've got Iraqis mixed into it.
[01:36:40.170 --> 01:36:46.972]  I mean, this is just classic black-op with all this confusion, all these different fallback plans, all these different fallback patsies.
[01:36:46.972 --> 01:36:47.872]  Amazing stuff.
[01:36:49.258 --> 01:36:56.847]  And that's why folks have got to go to PrisonPlanet.com and check out for yourselves the research, the information.
[01:36:56.847 --> 01:36:59.911]  Go read the affidavit for yourself.
[01:36:59.911 --> 01:37:06.779]  In fact, before I go back to more of your calls and shift gears into North American Union Summit news that just happened Friday and Saturday,
[01:37:08.388 --> 01:37:10.750]  Let me just go through some notes I've written concerning this.
[01:37:10.750 --> 01:37:12.231]  Where is the media?
[01:37:12.231 --> 01:37:16.394]  This should be a national story, regardless of whether people think it's credible or not.
[01:37:16.394 --> 01:37:37.428]  I believe it is, that you've got the guy who would never, you know, basically confess to all this, not going, yes, I was set up, I was a patsy, here are the documents, here are the names, we tried to put this on during the trial, we weren't allowed to, here it all is, and it's in a couple newspapers and one or two TV stations locally in Oklahoma have picked it up.
[01:37:39.694 --> 01:37:42.857]  But the good news is, in the past, the mainline media could bury things.
[01:37:42.857 --> 01:37:44.618]  You cannot bury this stuff now.
[01:37:44.618 --> 01:37:50.884]  So go to PrisonPlanet.com, get the affidavit, get the documents, get the news articles, and email it to the Four Winds.
[01:37:50.884 --> 01:37:51.705]  And again, my film,
[01:37:53.131 --> 01:38:01.874]  9-11 The Road to Tyranny is three hours long and the first 20-30 minutes is admitted examples of our government staging terror, not our government but the criminals that run it.
[01:38:01.874 --> 01:38:03.274]  They say they're our government.
[01:38:03.274 --> 01:38:06.815]  Then we spend 45 minutes on Oklahoma City.
[01:38:06.815 --> 01:38:10.316]  We spend like five on the first World Trade Center attack.
[01:38:10.316 --> 01:38:15.518]  We show the New York Times where the FBI cooked the bomb, drove the driver, let it go forward.
[01:38:15.518 --> 01:38:15.838]  It's just...
[01:38:17.418 --> 01:38:20.320]  It's so important that you find out why they do this.
[01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:21.741]  Problem, reaction, solution.
[01:38:21.741 --> 01:38:28.086]  They create the problem, they create the crisis, and then they offer the solution when you're scared.
[01:38:28.086 --> 01:38:30.108]  It's that simple.
[01:38:30.108 --> 01:38:32.950]  But here are some of the other notes that I have.
[01:38:32.950 --> 01:38:33.731]  And there's just so many.
[01:38:35.313 --> 01:38:40.034]  The FBI and Congressman Dana Rohrabacher earlier this year went and interviewed Nichols.
[01:38:40.034 --> 01:38:49.577]  Nichols wanted to talk to the Congressman alone, the FBI, and since they'd be there, Rohrabacher said, listen, I'm only here to talk about when you travel to the Philippines and the Arab connection.
[01:38:49.577 --> 01:38:56.279]  For those that don't know, that's Project Bojinka, the blow-up airplanes we're trying to connect them to, which is tied to Ramsey Yusuf, another clear operative.
[01:38:57.533 --> 01:39:01.256]  And wouldn't discuss the other evidence with him.
[01:39:01.256 --> 01:39:08.101]  He's been blocked from talking to the media since 2004 when he first tried to contact Attorney General, then Attorney General John Ashcroft.
[01:39:08.101 --> 01:39:12.564]  And there was a prison order put in that he couldn't talk to the media after that.
[01:39:12.564 --> 01:39:17.167]  A lawyer was able to get in there and get this deposition.
[01:39:17.167 --> 01:39:18.428]  That's what we put out.
[01:39:18.428 --> 01:39:26.634]  Though the exhibits, A through G, have been sealed, and I have the federal order here in front of me on that.
[01:39:27.862 --> 01:39:33.226]  And we have the attempted setup in the document where they were trying to connect it to gun shows and the Second Amendment.
[01:39:33.226 --> 01:39:37.029]  McVeigh was going around under FBI direction, this reports, to do that.
[01:39:37.029 --> 01:39:45.296]  We know that informants who were outside of the conspiracy kept saying they're planning to bomb the Alfred P. Murrah building and they kept being told, shut up, you're off the case.
[01:39:45.296 --> 01:39:47.418]  You'll be indicted if you tell anybody what you know.
[01:39:47.418 --> 01:39:48.339]  They'd go public.
[01:39:48.339 --> 01:39:50.180]  People were going public before the bombing.
[01:39:50.180 --> 01:39:52.402]  And then they would be indicted and beat the case.
[01:39:53.636 --> 01:39:55.437]  There's just so many points here.
[01:39:55.437 --> 01:39:57.657]  We're writing a big article about this right now.
[01:39:57.657 --> 01:40:04.860]  Another really important area that's in the affidavit, and that is in paragraph 35.
[01:40:04.860 --> 01:40:08.461]  Let me go to paragraph 35 here.
[01:40:08.461 --> 01:40:19.365]  I try to take a little vacation down at Port Aransas with my wife and children for two days, and I just sat there in front of the computer researching and reading lawsuits the entire time.
[01:40:19.365 --> 01:40:22.806]  But it goes into how McVeigh built a bomb,
[01:40:23.749 --> 01:40:40.943]  A lot smaller than what they claimed, at least half the size, that it wouldn't work, that the ammonium nitrate had been stolen more than a year before and had gotten wet, and that McVeigh tried to do a test bomb in a jar, and that it didn't explode, only the primer, only the detonator exploded, and he was real mad.
[01:40:41.804 --> 01:40:49.366]  It goes into how Attorney Steven Jones, in the case, entered the documents with the real drawings of this.
[01:40:49.366 --> 01:40:57.268]  Now it doesn't fit in with the book written with some clear establishment types claiming that he did build this incredibly powerful bomb.
[01:40:57.268 --> 01:40:58.188]  Why was that important?
[01:40:58.188 --> 01:41:09.991]  Because even if the truck was solid plastic explosives, military grade, of the highest power, it wouldn't be able to knock out columns further back and cut them off perfectly while not knocking down columns that were right up against the truck.
[01:41:09.991 --> 01:41:11.231]  You know, just very close to the truck.
[01:41:12.925 --> 01:41:14.826]  And it goes through all of that.
[01:41:14.826 --> 01:41:16.087]  It's just so many facets.
[01:41:16.087 --> 01:41:21.091]  This fits with everything we know and the research that we've done here.
[01:41:21.091 --> 01:41:23.392]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[01:41:23.392 --> 01:41:26.495]  Let's go to Paula in Florida.
[01:41:26.495 --> 01:41:27.455]  Paula, you're on the air.
[01:41:27.455 --> 01:41:28.016]  Welcome.
[01:41:28.016 --> 01:41:29.357]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[01:41:29.357 --> 01:41:35.101]  I saw the thing about the North American Union and the other one from Switzerland.
[01:41:35.101 --> 01:41:40.045]  And it looks like they were trying to say all this is being done for economic reasons.
[01:41:40.382 --> 01:41:42.504]  Oh, it's going to help you to have a North American Union.
[01:41:42.504 --> 01:41:44.165]  It's going to be wonderful, yes.
[01:41:44.165 --> 01:41:44.705]  Yeah, sure.
[01:41:44.705 --> 01:41:48.148]  Just like NAFTA helped us, the big giant sucking sound that Ross Perot talked about.
[01:41:48.148 --> 01:41:52.592]  Yeah, is Ron Paul, is he still going to put that resolution through?
[01:41:52.592 --> 01:41:58.336]  He has introduced legislation to pull us out of NAFTA and GATT and the SPP, Security and Prosperity Partnership.
[01:41:58.336 --> 01:42:02.059]  He's introduced legislation to abolish the Federal Reserve, and he is running for President.
[01:42:02.059 --> 01:42:04.101]  I appreciate your call, Paula.
[01:42:04.101 --> 01:42:08.224]  Now shifting gears, when we get back in the final segment, we'll take a few calls on the North American Union.
[01:42:08.744 --> 01:42:23.938]  For those that don't know, in March of 2005, President Bush with Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin and Mexican President Vicente Fox secretly, the details of the agreement are still secret, signed a security and prosperity partnership.
[01:42:23.938 --> 01:42:28.662]  Then, last year, the SPP met in September in Western Canada.
[01:42:29.504 --> 01:42:34.266]  And Judicial Watch sued and got the documents from the Department of Labor.
[01:42:34.266 --> 01:42:36.307]  They couldn't get the documents from the Justice Department.
[01:42:36.307 --> 01:42:37.608]  They refused to release them.
[01:42:37.608 --> 01:42:48.073]  We have the minutes of the main meeting where the first thing the heads of our government, Canadian and Mexican governments, say is we've got to keep this secret that it's a North American Union from the American people.
[01:42:48.073 --> 01:42:50.614]  This is at judicialwatch.org.
[01:42:50.614 --> 01:42:57.798]  We've written articles on it, WorldNetDaily has, Human Events has, a few other major publications have, but Lou Dobbs has talked about it, but that's it!
[01:42:58.616 --> 01:43:13.527]  Imagine a secret agreement, almost two years ago Bush signs, they meet in secret, last September again, and the whole meeting is about keeping it secret from the public, and how to set up a North American Union carbon tax, and how to do it stealthily.
[01:43:13.527 --> 01:43:20.332]  Well, now Canada.com, Canadian Free Press, one of their biggest publications reports, North American political leaders meet in Ottawa.
[01:43:21.138 --> 01:43:29.744]  And you read it, and it says they're meeting to deflect criticism and tell everybody it's okay, and they just want to harmonize our laws, police and military, to keep us all safe.
[01:43:29.744 --> 01:43:32.646]  We'll break it down when we get back.
[01:43:32.646 --> 01:43:34.807]  But you got the general public.
[01:43:34.807 --> 01:43:38.009]  They call their congressmen or women, and they say it doesn't exist.
[01:43:38.009 --> 01:43:39.670]  Congress has no authority over this.
[01:43:39.670 --> 01:43:41.672]  They've been kept completely in the dark.
[01:43:41.672 --> 01:43:43.313]  Most bills aren't even read.
[01:43:43.313 --> 01:43:44.694]  Did you know that?
[01:43:44.694 --> 01:43:46.435]  Well, there was never even a bill brought forward.
[01:43:46.435 --> 01:43:48.056]  They're just doing all of this.
[01:43:49.423 --> 01:43:53.255]  All right, we'll be right back on the other side with the final segment.
[01:43:53.255 --> 01:43:54.739]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:43:54.739 --> 01:43:55.160]  Stay with us.

[01:45:24.434 --> 01:45:24.774]  I think so.
[01:45:40.828 --> 01:45:41.128]  I don't know.
[01:46:06.974 --> 01:46:09.858]  Are you in sales or do you own your own business?
[01:46:09.858 --> 01:46:11.781]  If so, I want you to think of a number.
[01:46:11.781 --> 01:46:13.945]  Think of the amount of money you'd like to make this year.
[01:46:13.945 --> 01:46:15.046]  Do you have it?
[01:46:15.046 --> 01:46:16.568]  Okay, so what's stopping you?
[01:46:16.568 --> 01:46:17.710]  It's not your drive.
[01:46:17.710 --> 01:46:19.032]  It's not your skills.
[01:46:19.032 --> 01:46:21.997]  Chances are it's your ability to find new leads.
[01:46:21.997 --> 01:46:22.758]  It's not easy.
[01:46:23.038 --> 01:46:23.118]  Yes.
[01:46:44.284 --> 01:46:44.644]  I think so.
[01:47:06.824 --> 01:47:15.569]  According to a recent report by the National Institute of Health, high blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease and the chief risk factor for stroke and heart failure.
[01:47:15.569 --> 01:47:17.591]  It affects about 50 million Americans.
[01:47:17.591 --> 01:47:19.112]  That's 1 in 4 adults.
[01:47:19.112 --> 01:47:25.475]  Because many people have high blood pressure for years without knowing it, the American Heart Association calls it the silent killer.
[01:47:25.475 --> 01:47:29.438]  At ResearchedHerbs.com, we recognize your concern for your well-being.

[01:48:08.203 --> 01:48:11.764]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:48:11.764 --> 01:48:19.627]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:48:19.627 --> 01:48:24.829]  Crushing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:48:24.829 --> 01:48:25.949]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:48:31.514 --> 01:48:33.516]  We're here every Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:48:33.516 --> 01:48:33.936]  Central.
[01:48:33.936 --> 01:48:35.257]  It's 5 to 7 p.m.
[01:48:35.257 --> 01:48:35.578]  Eastern.
[01:48:35.578 --> 01:48:42.824]  I want to thank all of our affiliate sponsors, listeners, the great folks running the show, Paul and Trey.
[01:48:42.824 --> 01:48:46.487]  All right, I want to go to your calls, John in the Netherlands, Paul in Bastrop and others.
[01:48:46.487 --> 01:48:48.949]  We're going to go to your calls here in just a few minutes.
[01:48:48.949 --> 01:48:56.896]  But the Security and Prosperity Partnership, SPP, the agreement between Mexico and Canada is secret, but then we got the four-year documents.
[01:48:58.206 --> 01:49:03.349]  From last year's meeting in January, thanks to Judicial Watch, the whole thing's about secrecy.
[01:49:03.349 --> 01:49:05.111]  They say it's the North American Union.
[01:49:05.111 --> 01:49:12.055]  The chairman of the thing is Robert Pasture from the Council on Foreign Relations, who's written towards North American integration, towards the North American Union.
[01:49:12.055 --> 01:49:14.517]  They have meetings on C-SPAN and admitted to that in the past.
[01:49:14.517 --> 01:49:15.958]  That's how we know about it.
[01:49:15.958 --> 01:49:19.820]  Just like the European Union started as a so-called trade deal.
[01:49:19.820 --> 01:49:24.103]  Now, this is from the Canadian press.
[01:49:24.944 --> 01:49:27.868]  It says, North American political leaders meet in Ottawa.
[01:49:27.868 --> 01:49:39.823]  The North American ministers deflected criticism that they had consulted only big business for their talks on trade and security rules, suggesting Friday that there are different venues for public interest and labor groups to raise their concerns and suggestions.
[01:49:39.823 --> 01:49:41.446]  That's because of last year's meeting in secret.
[01:49:41.966 --> 01:49:50.633]  And it's three leaders from each country, the Secretary of State, the military leader, and their homeland security leader, or the same designate office, meet and make the decisions.
[01:49:50.633 --> 01:49:52.975]  And they say, oh, this way the bureaucracy doesn't hold it up.
[01:49:52.975 --> 01:49:54.136]  You mean the Congress?
[01:49:54.136 --> 01:49:56.638]  You mean the parliaments?
[01:49:56.638 --> 01:49:58.059]  Just incredible.
[01:49:58.059 --> 01:50:00.061]  Now listen to this, and read between the lines.
[01:50:00.061 --> 01:50:06.546]  The SPP was struck by leaders of the three countries in 2005, secretly I would add, to enhance the continent's competitiveness.
[01:50:06.546 --> 01:50:07.707]  Oh, it'll be so good for us!
[01:50:08.385 --> 01:50:15.772]  But for at least the first year, received little attention with their dry talk on regulations and cutting down on paperwork.
[01:50:15.772 --> 01:50:24.780]  Recently, nationalist groups and politicians in Canada and the United States have raised alarm bells over the lack of formal consultation with either civil society or legislatures.
[01:50:24.780 --> 01:50:27.642]  This is a 10-page report from the Canadian Free Press.
[01:50:27.642 --> 01:50:28.363]  It's a good report.
[01:50:29.003 --> 01:50:45.639]  Some of the issues that the ministers discussed during their meetings included finalizing a North American plan for dealing with the flu pandemic, that means a martial law grid, and another on a common regulatory environment in all three countries, that means laws, harmonizing laws, integration, continental integration is what it's called.
[01:50:46.306 --> 01:50:48.907]  That could include common food safety rules.
[01:50:48.907 --> 01:50:50.027]  That's already happening.
[01:50:50.027 --> 01:50:51.428]  That's part of the Animal ID.
[01:50:51.428 --> 01:50:56.689]  Canadians, as is Canada regularly, currently has more stringent rules for fortified products.
[01:50:56.689 --> 01:51:01.771]  That's the Codex Alimentarius banning most over-the-counter vitamins and total regulation.
[01:51:01.771 --> 01:51:03.091]  Right there!
[01:51:03.091 --> 01:51:12.114]  Insiders say the value of the SPP is that it puts the weight of ministers and national leaders behind projects that might normally languish for years among bureaucrats.
[01:51:12.114 --> 01:51:13.574]  You mean the legislatures and parliaments.
[01:51:14.798 --> 01:51:16.459]  Those aren't bureaucracies, you are.
[01:51:16.459 --> 01:51:20.282]  The issue of public consultation was at least identified during their meetings.
[01:51:20.282 --> 01:51:27.206]  In the final statement released by the ministers, they said they discussed the importance of transparency and communication with stakeholders and the public.
[01:51:27.206 --> 01:51:29.488]  Stakeholders means the corporations that are global.
[01:51:29.488 --> 01:51:30.829]  When you hear that, run for the hills.
[01:51:31.620 --> 01:51:37.001]  NDP leader Jack Layton raised the issue during Friday's question period in the comments.
[01:51:37.001 --> 01:51:45.023]  The fact is, these discussions are worrisome to all Canadians, they have been incredibly secret from the get-go, and there has been little public input, Layton said.
[01:51:45.023 --> 01:51:49.324]  The government has not sought out the opinion of Parliament or the public on it.
[01:51:49.324 --> 01:51:51.364]  Of course the Conservatives think they know best.
[01:51:51.364 --> 01:51:54.345]  I'm talking about the fake government, it's not Conservative.
[01:51:55.095 --> 01:51:57.336]  And it just goes on and on, folks.
[01:51:57.336 --> 01:52:02.477]  So now they're having to go public with it, but spinning it, claiming it's for the economy.
[01:52:02.477 --> 01:52:12.539]  No, it was the three leaders of each country over the infrastructure meeting last year with over 200 CEOs to lobby, basically, and discuss the payoffs.
[01:52:12.539 --> 01:52:17.320]  This is racketeering, this is criminal, and Lou Dobbs has said it, not just Alex Jones.
[01:52:17.320 --> 01:52:19.701]  Let's talk to John in the Netherlands.
[01:52:19.701 --> 01:52:20.501]  You're on the air.
[01:52:20.501 --> 01:52:21.381]  Welcome.
[01:52:21.381 --> 01:52:23.462]  Yeah, great show, Alex.
[01:52:23.462 --> 01:52:23.782]  Thank you.
[01:52:23.782 --> 01:52:24.422]  I'm a big fan of you.
[01:52:26.255 --> 01:52:27.495]  Yes, I'm from the Netherlands.
[01:52:27.495 --> 01:52:32.157]  My name is John Coulis.
[01:52:32.157 --> 01:52:32.997]  I know, I know.
[01:52:32.997 --> 01:52:35.999]  I just want to expose her too in the Netherlands.
[01:52:35.999 --> 01:52:38.240]  I do my job well.
[01:52:38.240 --> 01:52:45.323]  We have on the Wikipedia, we have a page concerning the Oklahoma City bombing and if you look at the
[01:52:45.811 --> 01:52:47.691]  Section on Conspiracy Theories.
[01:52:47.691 --> 01:52:49.932]  I want to hear your response to this.
[01:52:49.932 --> 01:52:51.432]  I looked at that just two nights ago.
[01:52:51.432 --> 01:52:54.953]  It says a few people think they're stupid conspiracies.
[01:52:54.953 --> 01:52:56.413]  Just a few people.
[01:52:56.413 --> 01:52:57.373]  Oh yes.
[01:52:57.373 --> 01:52:58.833]  Just a few people in other things.
[01:52:58.833 --> 01:53:02.874]  What I'm also interested in is that congressman in 2006, Dana Rohrabacher.
[01:53:02.874 --> 01:53:04.194]  I don't know if I pronounced it well.
[01:53:04.194 --> 01:53:11.755]  She mentioned on CNN that there's nothing wrong with adding to a conspiracy theory when there might be a conspiracy fact.
[01:53:11.755 --> 01:53:13.676]  No, he's the guy that... It's a male.
[01:53:13.676 --> 01:53:15.156]  He went and... He's in the affidavit.
[01:53:15.808 --> 01:53:17.551]  He went and interviewed Nichols.
[01:53:17.551 --> 01:53:20.776]  The government shielded us because they're scared to death.
[01:53:20.776 --> 01:53:22.759]  Wow.
[01:53:22.759 --> 01:53:23.700]  I found it interesting.
[01:53:23.700 --> 01:53:30.410]  You know, this Oklahoma bombing sitting was being broadcast on local television, Amsterdam, on exposure TV.
[01:53:31.577 --> 01:53:33.058]  In 1995.
[01:53:33.058 --> 01:53:37.901]  So we were very fast in exposing all the information that was available then.
[01:53:37.901 --> 01:53:41.483]  So it was on your television then, how there were bombs inside and all that?
[01:53:41.483 --> 01:53:42.143]  Yes, yes.
[01:53:42.143 --> 01:53:46.246]  Including that there were bomb experts explaining there must be two bombs.
[01:53:46.246 --> 01:53:50.428]  The former head of Air Force Weapons Development and countless others.
[01:53:50.428 --> 01:53:58.813]  Look, this all came out in the Grand Jury and the FBI came to the Grand Jury Foreman's House and put their hands on their guns and said, shut up or it's over for you.
[01:53:59.531 --> 01:54:05.337]  Including that they can actually registrate if there's a tiny earthquake.
[01:54:05.337 --> 01:54:07.399]  It showed the classic demolition.
[01:54:07.399 --> 01:54:09.300]  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:54:09.300 --> 01:54:10.361]  Exactly.
[01:54:10.361 --> 01:54:11.242]  And they can see that.
[01:54:11.242 --> 01:54:12.664]  University of Oklahoma U.S.
[01:54:12.664 --> 01:54:13.845]  Geological Survey.
[01:54:13.845 --> 01:54:17.028]  Two separate seismograph systems picked up the same signature.
[01:54:17.028 --> 01:54:21.992]  Yes, and that's what convinced me that there's more going on than only one bomb.
[01:54:21.992 --> 01:54:24.054]  Well, I have the actual seismograph reports.
[01:54:24.054 --> 01:54:24.615]  It's incredible.
[01:54:25.407 --> 01:54:25.847]  Yes.
[01:54:25.847 --> 01:54:33.472]  I feel, you know, that was my eye-opener that the media is controlled and, you know, we have to have an alternative media.
[01:54:33.472 --> 01:54:37.274]  I think we have a great slogan that we are the media.
[01:54:37.274 --> 01:54:44.138]  We are the media, the mainstream media is controlled, but the mainstream media is having to let more and more of this come out now because they're becoming obsolete.
[01:54:44.138 --> 01:54:45.599]  They're not even in the game anymore.
[01:54:46.532 --> 01:54:49.654]  Their viewers, their readers, their listeners are imploding.
[01:54:49.654 --> 01:54:52.216]  Alternative media is exploding.
[01:54:52.216 --> 01:54:55.158]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[01:54:55.158 --> 01:54:59.041]  Let's talk to Joe in Ohio, then we'll go to Paul.
[01:54:59.041 --> 01:55:00.842]  Go ahead, Joe.
[01:55:00.842 --> 01:55:07.066]  Alex, in less than 60 days, Mexican is going to cut 100 trucking companies to run free in our country.
[01:55:07.066 --> 01:55:11.349]  Yeah, that came out in the AP yesterday, that they're going to have, quote, you know, these companies.
[01:55:13.068 --> 01:55:17.010]  They've had Mexican trucks driving the length and breadth of the country for at least three years.
[01:55:17.010 --> 01:55:18.790]  We're in the North American Union.
[01:55:18.790 --> 01:55:19.411]  It's happening.
[01:55:19.411 --> 01:55:22.592]  The state police have been told, you know, leave them alone.
[01:55:22.592 --> 01:55:24.473]  They're going to be under different rules.
[01:55:24.473 --> 01:55:26.814]  It's just the destruction of our country.
[01:55:26.814 --> 01:55:28.594]  But now they're announcing it to the public.
[01:55:28.594 --> 01:55:31.635]  Kind of like they passed the law of the national ID card two years ago.
[01:55:31.635 --> 01:55:36.818]  Now they're getting around to announcing it on the news.
[01:55:36.818 --> 01:55:37.918]  Go ahead and comment on that if you'd like.
[01:55:40.187 --> 01:55:41.368]  They're driving junk.
[01:55:41.368 --> 01:55:45.791]  The guys are running three drivers to a truck.
[01:55:45.791 --> 01:55:47.612]  They're cutting holes in the bottom of the sleeper.
[01:55:47.612 --> 01:55:50.674]  Well, sir, it's just like Bank of America and Wells Fargo.
[01:55:50.674 --> 01:55:54.556]  No ID needed to get a bank account, but if you're a citizen, three forms of ID.
[01:55:54.556 --> 01:55:58.679]  And the state police, this even came out in Tennessee last year, they were told, leave them alone.
[01:55:58.679 --> 01:55:59.980]  This is the new America.
[01:55:59.980 --> 01:56:04.703]  Okay, if it helps destroy the country and the sovereignty, the police and the system were told, give them a go.
[01:56:05.383 --> 01:56:07.564]  Look, you know, get out a jail-free card.
[01:56:07.564 --> 01:56:12.285]  American citizens are the fat, dumb, and happy cattle that'll take anything, so we're gonna get it.
[01:56:12.285 --> 01:56:13.725]  We're gonna get anything.
[01:56:13.725 --> 01:56:18.686]  We're gonna have the President sign secret agreements to destroy our country, and we're supposed to all just shut up about it.
[01:56:18.686 --> 01:56:23.247]  And yes, I know how junky these trucks are and the problems they're causing.
[01:56:23.247 --> 01:56:24.608]  It makes me sick.
[01:56:24.608 --> 01:56:25.808]  All right, Alex, you're doing a great job.
[01:56:25.808 --> 01:56:26.088]  Keep it up.
[01:56:26.088 --> 01:56:26.528]  Thank you.
[01:56:26.528 --> 01:56:27.468]  I appreciate your call.
[01:56:27.468 --> 01:56:29.709]  Let's talk to Paul and Bastrop, final caller.
[01:56:29.709 --> 01:56:30.569]  You're on the air, Paul.
[01:56:30.569 --> 01:56:30.909]  Go ahead.
[01:56:31.847 --> 01:56:33.067]  Good evening, Alex.
[01:56:33.067 --> 01:56:36.648]  You know, a lot of this is becoming so, so transparent.
[01:56:36.648 --> 01:56:43.630]  I mean, it's been transparent to me for years, starting with Waco and a little before that.
[01:56:43.630 --> 01:56:56.373]  Surely we have somebody on the national figure, possibly a presidential candidate that's willing to blow this all up, because I think we're at
[01:56:56.986 --> 01:57:01.291]  Anywhere between 35 and 60 percent of the people realize this is going on.
[01:57:01.291 --> 01:57:02.833]  They know the open borders.
[01:57:02.833 --> 01:57:04.955]  We know about the North American Union.
[01:57:04.955 --> 01:57:06.677]  We know about Waco.
[01:57:06.677 --> 01:57:08.499]  Oklahoma, we're a little fuzzy on.
[01:57:08.499 --> 01:57:10.522]  9-1-1, we're a little fuzzy on.
[01:57:10.522 --> 01:57:15.387]  But it's so transparent, surely a national figure can rise and
[01:57:17.109 --> 01:57:21.911]  Well, they could kill a national figure, or he could die of a heart attack, or he could be struck by a bolt of lightning.
[01:57:21.911 --> 01:57:25.132]  But an idea, as V says, is bulletproof.
[01:57:25.132 --> 01:57:27.773]  Ideas and the truth cannot be stopped.
[01:57:27.773 --> 01:57:29.334]  You know, here's the analogy.
[01:57:29.334 --> 01:57:34.236]  Twenty dollars of the truth can destroy a trillion dollars, or twenty trillion dollars of lies.
[01:57:34.236 --> 01:57:39.277]  And we're going to win, and this idea of liberty and freedom and reality cannot be defeated.
[01:57:39.277 --> 01:57:42.559]  And thanks to folks like you out there, sir, we're going to win with God's help.
[01:57:42.559 --> 01:57:43.319]  Well, keep up the good work.
[01:57:44.031 --> 01:57:44.731]  Thank you, sir.
[01:57:44.731 --> 01:57:45.472]  I'll try.
[01:57:45.472 --> 01:57:46.052]  Help us.
[01:57:46.052 --> 01:57:56.737]  Go to PrisonPlanet.com, get our Oklahoma City reports, get the documents, get them out of the four winds, message boards, MySpace, call the talk radio, call the drudge tonight, call them to be on the Beltway coming up next.
[01:57:56.737 --> 01:57:57.377]  I mean, I want to hear you.
[01:57:57.377 --> 01:57:58.798]  Call them to be on the Beltway.
[01:57:58.798 --> 01:58:00.759]  Whatever subject they're talking about and work it in.
[01:58:00.759 --> 01:58:01.419]  Call in.
[01:58:01.419 --> 01:58:02.059]  Get aggressive.
[01:58:02.059 --> 01:58:03.320]  Start your own websites.
[01:58:03.320 --> 01:58:04.801]  Tell everybody about TerrorStorm.
[01:58:04.801 --> 01:58:06.301]  I made a $100,000 film.
[01:58:06.301 --> 01:58:07.482]  Put it out on Google Video for free.
[01:58:08.522 --> 01:58:11.865]  I may not be able to do that with the next one because I'm still broke, but, you know, TerrorStorm.
[01:58:11.865 --> 01:58:13.186]  History of government sponsored terror.
[01:58:13.186 --> 01:58:13.666]  TerrorStorm.
[01:58:13.666 --> 01:58:14.347]  Google it.
[01:58:14.347 --> 01:58:19.731]  Google, uh, The Road to Tyranny to see the newscast and the footage of them taking the bombs out.
[01:58:19.731 --> 01:58:22.794]  Or go to InfoWars.com and buy the DVDs.
[01:58:22.794 --> 01:58:26.957]  The high quality DVDs so you can make copies of those and get them out and support us a little bit.
[01:58:26.957 --> 01:58:30.120]  Alright, we're about to end this transmission, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:58:30.120 --> 01:58:31.421]  It is a real honor to be here.
[01:58:31.421 --> 01:58:32.422]  It's scary to do this.
[01:58:32.422 --> 01:58:34.403]  It's scary to cover these topics.
[01:58:34.403 --> 01:58:35.264]  But I've got to do it.
[01:58:35.914 --> 01:58:37.977]  I mean, I learned about this stuff back in college.
[01:58:37.977 --> 01:58:41.021]  And I'm, for now, 12 years, almost 13 years.
[01:58:41.021 --> 01:58:42.203]  I'm 33 now.
[01:58:42.203 --> 01:58:44.046]  I've been doing this a long time.
[01:58:44.046 --> 01:58:46.849]  And I want my family to grow up and live in a safe, free society.
[01:58:46.849 --> 01:58:49.233]  See you back, same time next week, 4 to 6 central.
[01:58:49.233 --> 01:58:49.894]  God bless you all.
[01:58:57.245 --> 01:59:01.607]  It's no secret that Genesis Communications Network depends on listeners like you.

[01:59:31.008 --> 01:59:33.630]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[01:59:33.630 --> 01:59:37.452]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[01:59:37.452 --> 01:59:44.695]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.

[01:59:47.777 --> 01:59:49.197]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:59:57.037 --> 02:00:02.302]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming and the end of the world?
[02:00:02.302 --> 02:00:04.384]  You shall hear of wars and rumors of wars.
[02:00:04.384 --> 02:00:07.607]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[02:00:07.607 --> 02:00:11.050]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[02:00:11.050 --> 02:00:12.912]  We are living in this time of Earth's history.
[02:00:13.152 --> 02:00:17.134]  Many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom.
[02:00:17.134 --> 02:00:20.416]  But without the wisdom of God, this is impossible!
[02:00:20.416 --> 02:00:24.918]  2 Peter says, We have a more sure word of prophecy, and you do well if you take heed.
[02:00:24.918 --> 02:00:29.160]  But first know this, that no prophecy of the Scripture is of any private interpretation.
[02:00:29.600 --> 02:00:34.243]  The Bible says, we'd like you to receive this new offer, Packet B, The Unholy Alliance.
[02:00:34.243 --> 02:00:38.825]  These materials document the global leaders, political and religious, behind the scenes.

[02:00:59.830 --> 02:01:02.400]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
