[00:33.360 --> 00:40.600]  we are live my friends it is Tuesday the 22nd day of September 2011 over
[00:40.600 --> 00:46.160]  Minnesota governor Jesse Ventura will be joining us coming up in the second
[00:46.160 --> 00:51.080]  hour today with a lot of breaking news and interesting information also give
[00:51.080 --> 00:58.320]  us the latest on the upcoming season of conspiracy theory and also some
[00:58.320 --> 01:03.000]  interesting stories I was talking to him yesterday well his wife answered the
[01:03.000 --> 01:07.720]  phone Terry and he was telling me a story well she was telling me she's in
[01:07.720 --> 01:12.960]  yeah he's in the workout room on his elliptical and the German Shepherd is on
[01:12.960 --> 01:17.520]  the treadmill they like to watch sports together and I was talking to Jesse and
[01:17.520 --> 01:21.400]  he goes he was like yeah it's true the dog's so smart he did it on his own he
[01:21.400 --> 01:27.000]  figured out it was a treadmill and he asked to be on it so and now we we work
[01:27.000 --> 01:29.560]  out together I tell you that's just an amazing story but I'll get him to tell
[01:29.560 --> 01:33.360]  it thought himself just interesting little funny things like that Jesse
[01:33.360 --> 01:41.000]  Ventura coming up in the second hour today now I am going to attempt to be
[01:41.000 --> 01:47.440]  calm about this news but has a lot of ramifications and when I saw this last
[01:47.440 --> 01:55.080]  night when Rob and Aaron brought it to my attention I went and did a search and
[01:55.080 --> 02:01.240]  indeed my worst fears were correct all over the country there are federal
[02:01.240 --> 02:04.680]  grants because they pay the school's money depending on how many people they
[02:04.680 --> 02:11.600]  vaccinate they have quotas that they're going door-to-door and intimidating
[02:11.600 --> 02:16.720]  people and implying it's the law hey we need you to comply your child's got to
[02:16.720 --> 02:22.120]  have a shot to be in school and they're even going to home schoolers houses now
[02:22.120 --> 02:27.880]  and saying hey you need to vaccinate and they're trying to imply that it's the
[02:27.880 --> 02:33.720]  law especially in Mississippi and West Virginia this is all about getting you
[02:33.720 --> 02:38.240]  ready for forced inoculation in the model states health emergency powers act
[02:38.240 --> 02:43.000]  this is very very frightening I want to go ahead and just play part of this
[02:43.000 --> 02:46.520]  newscast now we're going to come back and get more into it than all the other
[02:46.520 --> 02:53.640]  news from solar flare set to hit the planet today to AP labeled racist for
[02:53.640 --> 02:59.160]  accurately transcribing Obama's speech the Bloomberg reporting what we already
[02:59.160 --> 03:05.120]  knew Fukushima is the worst nuclear disaster in history which we do that a
[03:05.120 --> 03:09.800]  weekend to it the isotope readings but hey our EPA just raised the radiation
[03:09.800 --> 03:15.120]  levels so now they say if you eat a gallon of I guess cyanide it's okay for
[03:15.120 --> 03:18.520]  you where it'll kill you but why don't they just raise what they say is safe
[03:18.520 --> 03:22.840]  and then it'll magically be okay I mean they say buildings fall from small
[03:22.840 --> 03:30.120]  fires now let's go ahead and go to part of this newscast
[03:32.920 --> 03:37.680]  yeah that's it's funny last night I actually found one that didn't have all
[03:37.680 --> 03:42.960]  of this on it and specifically ask the guys every student is vaccinated in the
[03:42.960 --> 03:47.640]  Thomas school officials went door-to-door with the nurse offering the Tdap
[03:47.640 --> 03:52.000]  vaccine to meet a new state mandate newsstands Natalie sense tagged along and
[03:52.000 --> 03:57.080]  has our story hello how are you ma'am my name is Haman Matlock with the Thomas
[03:57.080 --> 04:00.960]  Unified School District it's not easy going door-to-door making sure students
[04:00.960 --> 04:06.480]  are vaccinated your daughter is on independent study yeah Kayla has she
[04:06.480 --> 04:12.200]  been verified with her Tdap no okay we were coming today to give her a Tdap if
[04:12.200 --> 04:15.320]  she hasn't had it done yet get the f*** it's off my house
[04:15.320 --> 04:19.760]  Hamas Matlock dealing with a lot of sticky situations despite weeks of free
[04:19.760 --> 04:25.000]  clinics and warnings some the Thomas kids still have not received a shot for
[04:25.000 --> 04:29.160]  whooping cough there could be some family dynamics where they're having
[04:29.160 --> 04:33.920]  hardships in the home and this isn't the top priority and then making it day
[04:33.920 --> 04:37.760]  to day hello this is Haman Matlock with the Thomas Unified School District he

[06:59.280 --> 07:04.560]  Direct you've heard Alex explain how the silver lungs generator infuses the
[07:04.560 --> 07:07.720]  respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions
[07:07.720 --> 07:11.520]  yet many are unaware of the entire function of the silver lung system and
[07:11.520 --> 07:15.320]  how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the
[07:15.320 --> 07:19.800]  body my name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the developer of the silver lungs
[07:19.800 --> 07:24.120]  generator not only does the silver lung system produce endless colloidal and
[07:24.120 --> 07:28.480]  ionic silver solutions it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and
[07:28.480 --> 07:33.360]  devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas
[07:33.360 --> 07:40.520]  this includes the eyes ears nose lungs topically to the skin and orally for the
[07:40.520 --> 07:44.680]  digestive system be sure to watch our new seven minute video tour of the silver
[07:44.680 --> 07:50.960]  lung system at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the silver lung
[07:50.960 --> 07:55.680]  system works as well we are always ready to answer any questions you may have
[07:55.680 --> 08:00.480]  that's www.silverlungs.com
[08:00.480 --> 08:08.520]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[08:08.520 --> 08:26.280]  it is Tuesday the 27th day of September 2011 going to be alive here for at least
[08:26.280 --> 08:31.200]  the next three hours simulcasting on your local M and FM stations global
[08:31.200 --> 08:39.000]  shortwave XM satellite number one when it comes to free audio streams at info wars.com and of
[08:39.000 --> 08:45.560]  course in streaming five-camera video shoot at prisonplanet.tv if you'd like
[08:45.560 --> 08:52.840]  to see a whole other dimension to this transmission okay Jesse Ventura is going
[08:52.840 --> 08:58.680]  to be joining us you remember when he filed his suit a few months ago he had
[08:58.680 --> 09:02.920]  told me that he wanted to come on here and break the news of what his response
[09:02.920 --> 09:09.480]  was going to be if they threw his suit out of court pretty dramatic announcement
[09:09.480 --> 09:13.880]  that he hinted at that he would be making here and then people said well
[09:13.880 --> 09:18.680]  where's Jesse Ventura well the court this is the longest this court has ever
[09:18.680 --> 09:26.200]  taken to rule on a pretrial motion to dismiss that the feds have brought
[09:26.200 --> 09:34.960]  forward and the judges got to rule by November by mid November so Ventura
[09:34.960 --> 09:40.080]  will be back with us to make that announcement either way whether the
[09:40.080 --> 09:44.480]  suits going forward or whether it's not going forward also he's made good on
[09:44.480 --> 09:50.080]  his promise to not fly anymore he's got a RV and is driving around the country
[09:50.080 --> 09:57.360]  for his TV show conspiracy theory so Jesse will be joining us to talk about
[09:57.360 --> 10:02.040]  Ron Paul the 2012 election and he's got some interesting political announcements
[10:02.040 --> 10:06.680]  he's going to be making because when he called me last week just to check in and
[10:06.680 --> 10:10.320]  say hi I said well hey you know why don't you go ahead and come on anyways
[10:10.320 --> 10:14.560]  even though you don't have information on the TSA situation so he said sure
[10:14.560 --> 10:18.720]  because he's got a lot of other stuff to talk about so Jesse will be joining us
[10:18.720 --> 10:24.400]  coming up today and it's also good because he's not doing any media right
[10:24.400 --> 10:27.840]  now you know he does media kind of in these cycles and a books out of the
[10:27.840 --> 10:32.600]  TV shows out or something's going on but this is this will be a interview here
[10:32.600 --> 10:35.800]  in a doldrum when he hadn't been doing any interviews for the last last few
[10:35.800 --> 10:40.160]  months so should be informative with former Minnesota governor Jesse Ventura
[10:40.160 --> 10:49.480]  today okay you know the Sun in the last decade first was very active then was
[10:49.480 --> 10:53.920]  inactive for a while and now it's the most active in the recorded history
[10:53.920 --> 10:57.640]  there's only a few hundred years that they've been accurately able to really
[10:57.640 --> 11:03.200]  measure the amount of radiation coming off one of the first high-tech things
[11:03.200 --> 11:07.040]  European scientists were able to do was measure sunspots and other things and
[11:07.040 --> 11:14.240]  it's the busiest it's it's it's been in in recorded modern history and the Daily
[11:14.240 --> 11:20.240]  Mail and others are reporting the day the world went put or cup put earth in
[11:20.240 --> 11:26.040]  crosshairs of gigantic solar storm that could blow circuits of anything from
[11:26.040 --> 11:30.960]  satellite TV or electric power grids just a month ago they had power out in
[11:30.960 --> 11:35.840]  areas of Arizona and California did with solar solar storm that hit the earth
[11:35.840 --> 11:41.120]  now it only takes light as you know a few minutes to get here from the Sun but
[11:41.120 --> 11:46.120]  it takes these solar storms that move a lot quicker a lot longer and it's set to
[11:46.120 --> 11:54.440]  hit later in the day a sunspot 6,000 miles across so big it would dwarf the
[11:54.440 --> 11:59.360]  earth is releasing gigantic solar flares that could wreak havoc with
[11:59.360 --> 12:03.920]  electrical communications ranging from handheld electronics such as iPhones
[12:03.920 --> 12:10.080]  through sections of the power grid NASA has detected two X-class solar
[12:10.080 --> 12:15.920]  eruptions from 1302 the most extreme in the past week one that occurred
[12:15.920 --> 12:21.080]  September 24th produced an amazing light show over England last night but as far
[12:21.080 --> 12:26.400]  from over as the Sunspot isn't yet directly aligned with the earth the
[12:26.400 --> 12:31.040]  earth now today and tomorrow comes into alignment with the with the coronal mass
[12:31.040 --> 12:36.360]  ejection giant flamethrower shooting out from the Sun looking at an eye on it
[12:36.360 --> 12:42.000]  looks black because it's cooler than the actual Sun because it's being released
[12:42.000 --> 12:47.200]  into deep space and so basically a flamethrower shooting out like a clock
[12:47.200 --> 12:53.000]  as the as the Sun turns towards the earth the earth is coming in to that
[12:53.000 --> 12:59.080]  flamethrower but we're not getting the flame it since dissipates before it even
[12:59.080 --> 13:03.520]  gets out to Mercury there's all that radiation ionizing different types of
[13:03.520 --> 13:10.480]  radiation that is coming at us NASA experts have said anything electrical
[13:10.480 --> 13:15.200]  can be affected by such activity and again we show folks a document cam shot
[13:15.200 --> 13:19.880]  of these these are gigantic is actually three sunspots lined up hot stuff the
[13:19.880 --> 13:24.480]  behemoth Sunspot 1302 has been unleashing huge solar flares
[13:24.480 --> 13:30.120]  astronomer Dr. Ian Griffin CEO of Science Oxford told Mail Online active
[13:30.120 --> 13:35.960]  region 1302 is the source of all of these auroras seen yesterday and may well be
[13:35.960 --> 13:40.320]  the source of some more auroras over the next few nights that means it's charging
[13:40.320 --> 13:44.120]  up the atmosphere space weather forecasters estimate a 40% chance of
[13:44.120 --> 13:49.640]  more flares in the next 24 hours any such eruptions would be earth erected as
[13:49.640 --> 13:55.920]  the Sunspot crosses the center of the solar disk in short with no moon in the
[13:55.920 --> 14:01.120]  sky and an active region of the Sun the next few nights may be very interesting
[14:01.120 --> 14:05.000]  for sky watchers especially people towards the Northern Hemisphere there
[14:05.000 --> 14:08.000]  is some danger to the solar activity will disrupt communication systems
[14:08.000 --> 14:12.440]  especially in upper latitudes such as northern Canada and Scandinavia the Sun
[14:12.440 --> 14:16.760]  spot occurs when strawmanetic fields of the Sun reach the surface cool down
[14:16.760 --> 14:20.720]  according to NASA large ones can be seen clearly through telescopes and
[14:20.720 --> 14:31.480]  powerful cameras you know my whole point with this is my whole point here is
[14:31.480 --> 14:37.920]  that it's like the Iron Maiden song die with your boots on you got all these
[14:37.920 --> 14:41.720]  prophets of doom and destruction you want to tell you that it's man-made or
[14:41.720 --> 14:46.200]  that our carbon dioxide is going to kill us but they're not ever really worried
[14:46.200 --> 14:50.280]  about the asteroids or the solar flares or other things and the fact is this
[14:50.280 --> 14:54.920]  planet is out in deep space there's all sorts of stuff drifting in and around us
[14:54.920 --> 15:01.920]  we get hit by things all the time they've ever been out to the big crater in
[15:01.920 --> 15:05.720]  Arizona in fact let's pull that up for folks giant crater in Arizona will pull
[15:05.720 --> 15:10.800]  it up you know that's that's small compared to what it reportedly they
[15:10.800 --> 15:14.760]  believe killed the dinosaurs and now they know these things are hitting the
[15:14.760 --> 15:18.640]  earth every hundred thousand years or so they're not hitting every million or
[15:18.640 --> 15:21.280]  so like scientists had previously thought now that they have all these
[15:21.280 --> 15:26.040]  telescopes and other systems radio telescopes you name it they're able to
[15:26.040 --> 15:34.440]  see big asteroids meteorites hitting other planets hitting moons hitting
[15:34.440 --> 15:38.880]  Jupiter hitting Saturn with much more frequency they've done the mathematical
[15:38.880 --> 15:44.720]  algorithms that's why we don't know the truth about human civilization all
[15:44.720 --> 15:51.240]  we have is dingbat preachers interpretations of the Bible and
[15:51.240 --> 15:56.640]  basically masonic groups that wanted to discredit Christianity the last 200
[15:56.640 --> 16:01.960]  years that would misinterpret the Bible to make it look nonsensical and non
[16:01.960 --> 16:09.200]  scientific to create a false debate but now there's the giant crater in Arizona
[16:09.200 --> 16:13.040]  I forget the name of that what is it crater monument I forget exactly what
[16:13.040 --> 16:15.480]  they call it I know it's like a state or national park I forget I've been there
[16:15.480 --> 16:20.320]  I've been there as a child and hiked down into it amazing in fact that's
[16:20.320 --> 16:29.160]  somewhere I want to take my children to see the incredible things that are that
[16:29.160 --> 16:39.320]  are going on out west okay I tend to get on air here especially when I have red
[16:39.320 --> 16:53.000]  news that really gets me upset and I tend to procrastinate getting to it a
[16:53.000 --> 16:57.640]  there is a well orchestrated hoax going on with the controlled dinosaur
[16:57.640 --> 17:04.120]  corporate or medium to raise taxes on what's left of the middle class that of
[17:04.120 --> 17:11.480]  the main producers and consumers in the real Main Street grassroots economy the
[17:11.480 --> 17:20.440]  Wall Street anti-reality crony criminals that are openly anti-free market and
[17:20.440 --> 17:28.280]  anti-family and anti-industry for the West I have publicly been financing the
[17:28.280 --> 17:34.000]  controlled left and pushing the hoax on every new show I tune into this week on
[17:34.000 --> 17:39.080]  ABC you name it Warren Buffett everywhere for two years saying I'm rich
[17:39.080 --> 17:44.800]  raise taxes on me I'm exempt from taxes it's wrong and then when you go see the
[17:44.800 --> 17:49.560]  taxes he's supporting it's a tax increase on people making $125,000 a
[17:49.560 --> 17:55.280]  year individually or a quarter million man and woman as a couple that is not
[17:55.280 --> 18:01.760]  rich the devalued dollar that is middle-class and the keep devaluing the
[18:01.760 --> 18:08.080]  dollar it'll be lower middle class soon and if you and I've done reports on
[18:08.080 --> 18:10.400]  this but if you go look up Warren Buffett Bill Gates and others they
[18:10.400 --> 18:14.960]  lobbying the last 15 years to get the tax laws changed to make themselves
[18:14.960 --> 18:19.560]  exempt and that's why Microsoft pays almost no taxes general electric
[18:19.560 --> 18:24.000]  Berkshire Hathaway Warren Buffett's outfit all of them Google
[18:24.000 --> 18:28.760]  the list goes on and on and because they know people aren't sophisticated because
[18:28.760 --> 18:32.840]  they're not paying attention they go isn't it wrong that we're paying no
[18:32.840 --> 18:39.160]  taxes and then individually they're paying almost no taxes individually
[18:39.160 --> 18:42.800]  Warren Buffett says he pays 12% taxes and I've looked it up that's true his
[18:42.800 --> 18:48.440]  corporations nothing and he has foreign subsidiaries and private foundations
[18:48.440 --> 18:53.840]  that pay zero but the bait and switch here is that he's not talking about
[18:53.840 --> 18:58.320]  getting rid of that or the tens of trillions that are offshore and exempt
[18:58.320 --> 19:03.160]  in fact he's trying to make a deal and other elite a star right now to bring
[19:03.160 --> 19:09.280]  that money back basically tax-free that's been in the news and they hold this
[19:09.280 --> 19:12.480]  hostage they say well we won't bring back these trillions unless you make them
[19:12.480 --> 19:18.440]  tax-free while lecturing all day but I saw a Chicago Tribune article last week
[19:18.440 --> 19:24.080]  about property taxes up home values down and it's forcing people out of their
[19:24.080 --> 19:28.920]  houses which is what the system wants they want to nationalize housing you'll
[19:28.920 --> 19:32.320]  still have a few corporate corporations that make the money off of it but it'll
[19:32.320 --> 19:38.000]  be government managed and taxpayer back I saw another article out of Illinois
[19:38.000 --> 19:43.640]  today where they're raising scores of taxes knowing it'll destroy the economy
[19:43.640 --> 19:48.160]  so I thought I'd get into that and then they've begun the move for forced
[19:48.160 --> 19:53.240]  inoculation door-to-door and I'm so angry about this that I'm not gonna get
[19:53.240 --> 19:56.640]  angry and I'm gonna come I'm not gonna get angry because I don't I don't have
[19:56.640 --> 20:00.080]  the energy or the voice for it and I'm gonna come back and break this down stay

[24:31.000 --> 24:36.920]  think it's the greatest thing since sliced bread let's all be honest with
[24:36.920 --> 24:42.120]  ourselves that the government and the mainstream media lie at the start of the
[24:42.120 --> 24:47.040]  school year each year on radio TV and print and say it's the law you must take
[24:47.040 --> 24:53.880]  this growing list of vaccines and it's not true and Rick Perry came out four
[24:53.880 --> 24:58.920]  years ago and said it's the law you must take this shot and when he got caught
[24:58.920 --> 25:04.400]  lying the legislature came out and said there's no law and so Perry tried to get
[25:04.400 --> 25:13.240]  a law passed and failed now California has passed the law but it's not signed
[25:13.240 --> 25:21.520]  yet past the House and Senate it's on Governor Brown's desk making it the law
[25:21.520 --> 25:28.880]  that they will shoot your children up at school without telling you and we
[25:28.880 --> 25:33.560]  confirmed it back during the swine flu h1n1 hoax two years ago and we played
[25:33.560 --> 25:37.920]  newscast we're in Alabama and other areas they shot kids up whose parents had
[25:37.920 --> 25:41.720]  said don't shoot them up and then people said well that well the seven-year-old
[25:41.720 --> 25:45.480]  wanted it well a minor you can't say here minor you want some drugs you want
[25:45.480 --> 25:52.000]  some Jack Daniels you can't cuz I'm your minor you know wants to you know go
[25:52.000 --> 25:58.560]  in a topless bar take one in because they're a minor it's illegal and so
[25:58.560 --> 26:01.960]  basically they had tried to intimidate parents and tell them it's the law to take
[26:01.960 --> 26:06.640]  shots what we've confirmed is in California and other areas they're
[26:06.640 --> 26:09.760]  telling kids that it's already the law and shooting them up in the nurses
[26:09.760 --> 26:15.880]  office and we're getting contacted by families in Canada and other areas that
[26:15.880 --> 26:21.520]  their daughters are shot up at school and then get sick we've already had a
[26:21.520 --> 26:25.200]  lot of deaths from Gardasil and illnesses so what's gonna happen all over the
[26:25.200 --> 26:29.040]  country as they shoot the kids up at school after showing them a film and
[26:29.040 --> 26:33.480]  ordering them to basically again it's all about intimidation it's all about
[26:33.480 --> 26:39.280]  twisting of arms what's going to happen now remember there are more than 50
[26:39.280 --> 26:43.800]  vaccines that by the age of two government is trying to claim with the
[26:43.800 --> 26:48.800]  law you got to take when it's not a law think about how criminal that is how
[26:48.800 --> 26:54.320]  creepy that is that they're lying to you it's like somebody coming to your door
[26:54.320 --> 26:59.960]  and saying it's the law you've got to buy a magazine subscription from me or
[26:59.960 --> 27:04.280]  it's the law you've got to answer my questions or it's the law well that's
[27:04.280 --> 27:08.800]  what the census is doing now now they have yearly census and they come to your
[27:08.800 --> 27:12.720]  house and say oh it's not every 10 years now it's yearly you've got to answer
[27:12.720 --> 27:16.920]  all these questions there's no law you have a fifth amendment they're just
[27:16.920 --> 27:23.120]  doing it so it's all color of law power grab now that leads me to this next
[27:23.120 --> 27:32.680]  report of course it's out of california news 10 not tomas california it says
[27:32.680 --> 27:36.680]  school officials everybody's an official not servants are going door-to-door with
[27:36.680 --> 27:40.280]  a traveling nurse to give whooping cough shots unvaccinated students don't
[27:40.280 --> 27:45.240]  wait if you're above the age of three whooping cop is no big deal and of course
[27:45.240 --> 27:49.600]  most the formulas are more than half corn syrup and they have studies out
[27:49.600 --> 27:53.080]  that it's an autoimmune issue the kids are run down if a baby's healthy and
[27:53.080 --> 27:56.920]  regular mother's milk it's very rare that they don't deal with whooping cough very
[27:56.920 --> 28:01.640]  easily but they fear monger and and and push these shots and I've seen
[28:01.640 --> 28:05.320]  statistics in california especially in the highly educated places where upwards
[28:05.320 --> 28:09.680]  of 70% are unvaccinated and so they're saying there's going to be a whooping
[28:09.680 --> 28:16.200]  cop epidemic I've heard dr. Deena Dell go on air and say the people should be
[28:16.200 --> 28:19.440]  arrested that aren't taking shots because then they're going to get all of us
[28:19.440 --> 28:24.320]  sick well wait a minute if you've had all the vaccines then you're safe and
[28:24.320 --> 28:29.040]  we're idiots it's all about freedom you see once they socialize health care they
[28:29.040 --> 28:32.080]  can claim well I'm gonna have to pay for you the truth is we've covered the
[28:32.080 --> 28:35.600]  studies here people that are unvaccinated are much healthier her
[28:35.600 --> 28:39.000]  capita than those that are vaccinated and it's not that I don't don't even
[28:39.000 --> 28:44.120]  think that there isn't some truth to inoculation science it's that you can't
[28:44.120 --> 28:47.960]  trust these drug companies who've been caught over and over again adding
[28:47.960 --> 28:52.760]  cancer viruses adding sterilants we've covered the news but just type in
[28:52.760 --> 28:59.160]  cancer viruses and vaccines you'll get new scientists AP try UN caught
[28:59.160 --> 29:04.720]  sterilizing women with vaccines you'll get mainstream news UN caught giving
[29:04.720 --> 29:10.040]  children live polio shots deaths every year it happens it's not an accident a
[29:10.040 --> 29:13.880]  government that's done all this atomic chemical biological testing on our own
[29:13.880 --> 29:18.920]  troops killing them in many cases cannot be trusted with these big vaccine
[29:18.920 --> 29:23.600]  companies to mandate this so there's a hoax it's not the law now we come back

[33:32.440 --> 33:37.720]  comment at info wars.com door-to-door vaccination is training the public
[33:37.720 --> 33:42.160]  workforce inoculations this outrageous video shows the intimidation tactics of
[33:42.160 --> 33:47.360]  the system being ramped up to once again trick parents into vaccine
[33:47.360 --> 33:52.600]  compliance with the hoax that vaccinations are required and in fact
[33:52.600 --> 33:55.920]  rob do was in here asking me about this right before the show I need to start
[33:55.920 --> 34:02.040]  getting him to dig it out what it was like five years ago it was five years
[34:02.040 --> 34:10.840]  ago that I had the state attorney on from Maryland and it was a big national
[34:10.840 --> 34:16.600]  story children forcibly inoculated in Maryland was the headline and they had
[34:16.600 --> 34:20.520]  all these people on national TV good morning America you name it saying
[34:20.520 --> 34:26.000]  it's wrong these children have to take these shots and it showed the families
[34:26.000 --> 34:31.560]  crying more than 2,000 children and their parents being herded into a parking
[34:31.560 --> 34:41.440]  lot and into a state courthouse to be given the shots there in Baltimore and
[34:41.440 --> 34:47.680]  even the people fighting it all over CNN good morning America you name it now
[34:47.680 --> 34:50.880]  and I would get some of these activists group Sean and say what's wrong with you
[34:50.880 --> 34:55.560]  they would say it's wrong that it's the law they have to take this it's wrong
[34:55.560 --> 34:59.480]  these vaccines are dangerous and that's why the mainstream media was happy to
[34:59.480 --> 35:04.600]  have them on because it played into the hoax it was not the stinking law and I
[35:04.600 --> 35:07.760]  had listeners that were there on the ground when it happened that shot video
[35:07.760 --> 35:12.920]  we interviewed them live on the air and it was police dog SWAT teams because of
[35:12.920 --> 35:17.200]  radicals that were against what was happening and kids crying being lined up
[35:17.200 --> 35:21.080]  being given shots and I have the state attorney on I've got to get an interview
[35:21.080 --> 35:26.360]  out about five years ago and I said sir you know it's not the law in Maryland I
[35:26.360 --> 35:31.240]  read to him the code and he laughed and he said you're right Alex I forget his
[35:31.240 --> 35:35.560]  name he was like a tall handsome ball-headed black guy he said a state
[35:35.560 --> 35:42.360]  attorney he said he said you're right Alex I don't vaccinate my kids and
[35:42.360 --> 35:46.040]  started laughing at me and I said you know it's not funny that you know the
[35:46.040 --> 35:50.120]  law and got up there and played along and didn't tell people it wasn't the law
[35:50.120 --> 35:53.800]  and I said I know what you're doing you're threatening to kick him out of
[35:53.800 --> 36:00.200]  school because it's a policy just like zero tolerance is to say you've got to
[36:00.200 --> 36:05.280]  have the shots but not a law then you trigger a truancy law and you put a few
[36:05.280 --> 36:09.920]  people in jail he goes Alex you're real smart you ought to be a lawyer oh well
[36:09.920 --> 36:16.120]  we see it's all real funny that that guy had to shoot his kids up but he gets up
[36:16.120 --> 36:20.440]  there on singing in and says it you've got to get the shot so you're gonna go
[36:20.440 --> 36:25.960]  to jail you see that's this weird mind game with these people that it's like
[36:25.960 --> 36:30.920]  they're winners because they can lie to people and watch people go off the edge
[36:30.920 --> 36:44.120]  of a cliff I've had enough of it I mean that's like saying well I could lead a
[36:44.120 --> 36:47.800]  two-year-old out into traffic and watch him walk out in front of a truck boy
[36:47.800 --> 37:04.400]  I'm a big man it makes my head really really spend to watch all of this
[37:04.400 --> 37:09.640]  happen so continuing this outrageous video shows the intimidation tactics of
[37:09.640 --> 37:13.720]  the system being ramped up to once again trick parents into vaccine compliance
[37:13.720 --> 37:17.480]  with the hopes that vaccinations are required when there is and there has
[37:17.480 --> 37:22.920]  never when there is and has been a waiver as well as a natural right allowing
[37:22.920 --> 37:27.400]  parents to opt out now by going door to door the system is tip-toeing how about
[37:27.400 --> 37:33.400]  stampeding towards coercive vaccinations while the media lapdog readily
[37:33.400 --> 37:38.680]  portrays these parents as negligent and the students students as truant when
[37:38.680 --> 37:43.400]  the student in the video was evidently enrolled in some sort of independent
[37:43.400 --> 37:49.040]  study yeah they call it that now for homeschooling we'll see ps next travel
[37:49.040 --> 37:52.800]  in tandem with the school officer and the traveling doctor that's already
[37:52.800 --> 37:57.200]  happening Alex Jones will cover this in other aspects of the deceptive and
[37:57.200 --> 38:01.560]  harmful story in a special report tomorrow tune in to the info wash nightly
[38:01.560 --> 38:07.160]  news for more and then here's the article we'll play the video in a moment
[38:07.160 --> 38:12.840]  that Thomas school officials not servants are going door to door with a
[38:12.840 --> 38:17.600]  traveling nurse to give whooping cough shots to unvaccinated students a new
[38:17.600 --> 38:21.200]  state law requires students entering seventh through 12th grades to get
[38:21.200 --> 38:28.880]  vaccinated against the diseases by the start of the 2012 2011 school year notice
[38:28.880 --> 38:33.200]  they don't give the law that's not true either I've checked they've got a new law
[38:33.200 --> 38:37.880]  to ask the kids if they want to do it without parental consent and then
[38:37.880 --> 38:40.800]  basically intimidate them into it because of a lot of parents and say it's the
[38:40.800 --> 38:45.040]  law you're gonna do with the kids I mean you know they're doing it with them the
[38:45.040 --> 38:49.160]  legislature gave districts 30 days beyond the start of the school year to
[38:49.160 --> 38:53.400]  make sure all students were vaccinated or had a formal exemption filed by their
[38:53.400 --> 38:58.040]  parents or guardians but see they don't say at the door that there is an
[38:58.040 --> 39:05.360]  exemption and there's no law you got to do the exemption as the deadline passes
[39:05.360 --> 39:08.280]  thousands of students remain unvaccinated many school districts have
[39:08.280 --> 39:12.800]  been defying state law and allowing them on campus because it's not state law
[39:12.800 --> 39:21.200]  liars okay let's go ahead and go to this incredible newscast now now again they
[39:21.200 --> 39:27.600]  have already passed the law it's on the governor's desk to quote let children in
[39:27.600 --> 39:32.360]  the single digits age wise decide if they want to shot a child can't decide
[39:32.360 --> 39:35.520]  if they want to go to the planetarium you've got to sign the waiver they can't
[39:35.520 --> 39:39.520]  decide if they want to go to the Wild West days you've got to sign a waiver or
[39:39.520 --> 39:46.680]  to the zoo or to the history museum but in many states they take children as
[39:46.680 --> 39:50.320]  youngest 10 to have abortions without mommy and daddy knowing this is medical
[39:50.320 --> 39:54.720]  tyranny because the state intimidates them and tells them to do it and now
[39:54.720 --> 40:00.520]  it's going to be shots the remember the two years ago the California court ruled
[40:00.520 --> 40:04.600]  that the government is the guardian and parents aren't guardians of their
[40:04.600 --> 40:10.320]  children period and that homeschooling was illegal now it got overturned by a
[40:10.320 --> 40:15.400]  higher federal court at his federal level but just like it's being overturned
[40:15.400 --> 40:19.080]  everywhere when you go to jail or get charged with life in prison for videotape
[40:19.080 --> 40:24.080]  and cops in public the point is they're trying to put you in jail for life for
[40:24.080 --> 40:27.000]  videotaping in public when they know full well it's not illegal and the
[40:27.000 --> 40:33.120]  statute doesn't say that the point is they're trying to take in fact I see it
[40:33.120 --> 40:37.000]  with poor ignorant families they call it neglect the judge rules it's neglect
[40:37.000 --> 40:41.840]  and they take children every day they take millions of children a year so it
[40:41.840 --> 40:46.360]  they're taking children every day because they're not vaccinated there is no
[40:46.360 --> 40:50.320]  law but they do it and they get the parents in all scared and the judge
[40:50.320 --> 40:54.840]  says all right if you sign all these forms that admit to guilt and negligence
[40:54.840 --> 41:01.480]  and basically sign private corporate probation with me and we'll let the
[41:01.480 --> 41:06.280]  children go into foster care for a month and you might get them back or they
[41:06.280 --> 41:10.600]  might even say we'll give them back to you but then we're gonna have to watch
[41:10.600 --> 41:14.160]  and then now you're in their system now you're going to their psychiatrist
[41:14.160 --> 41:17.720]  hired by them now they're in your house now they find something else boom the
[41:17.720 --> 41:21.800]  kids are gone forever terminate parental rights
[41:21.800 --> 41:26.040]  fact I played it years ago we ought to dig it out of CBS newscaster locally
[41:26.040 --> 41:31.000]  with Judge Jean Mirm that they name the juvenile justice system after she looks
[41:31.000 --> 41:37.440]  just like Janet Napolitano same you know same spirit and it showed her in
[41:37.440 --> 41:41.800]  portable buildings in schools all over Austin every day she's at a new one they
[41:41.800 --> 41:45.520]  call the parents in and they say Billy has been late to class three times that
[41:45.520 --> 41:50.000]  is a truancy I'm gonna put you in juvenile hall for a month unless your
[41:50.000 --> 41:55.720]  father agrees to sign this now the father says yes ma'am yes ma'am on the news
[41:55.720 --> 42:02.000]  and signs the form the judge had no authority the state truancy law at that
[42:02.000 --> 42:09.480]  time I don't know what it is now was 14 unexcused absences in a semester the
[42:09.480 --> 42:17.800]  statute is 14 they were counting three times being late as the parents got them
[42:17.800 --> 42:23.800]  they're late they were counting three times late as a truancy and saying
[42:23.800 --> 42:27.280]  you're gonna go to jail and then having the dad sign an agreement that in the
[42:27.280 --> 42:33.600]  next semester his child would not be late to class one time or the child goes
[42:33.600 --> 42:42.520]  to jail it's all fraud and that judge sits there like a hardcore criminal con
[42:42.520 --> 42:47.760]  artist I'm on the radio here locally sue me Mir I know the law I know you're a
[42:47.760 --> 42:51.600]  big fat criminal and I'll call you one because you are one and truth is a total
[42:51.600 --> 42:56.160]  defense you get people in there and trick them into signing paperwork waving
[42:56.160 --> 42:59.920]  their rights to pack the giant criminal justice systems you built not to teach
[42:59.920 --> 43:04.320]  kids discipline but to take young little fourth graders like that kid I saw on
[43:04.320 --> 43:09.600]  TV and send them to a juvenile hall where they get raped where they get beat
[43:09.600 --> 43:14.520]  up and where they learn how to be criminals you know what happens you
[43:14.520 --> 43:17.160]  know what happens to most kids when gangs start beating them up they join the
[43:17.160 --> 43:24.200]  gang these schools and these juvenile systems are factories for crime now
[43:24.200 --> 43:30.440]  let's go to this wicked fraudulent newscast this wicked wicked wicked
[43:30.440 --> 43:36.040]  wicked wicked hoax here it is drastic measures to make sure every student is
[43:36.040 --> 43:39.960]  vaccinated in the Thomas school officials went door-to-door with the nurse
[43:39.960 --> 43:43.800]  offering the TDAP vaccine to meet a new state mandate
[43:43.800 --> 43:48.800]  new sense Natalie sense tagged along and has our story hello how are you ma'am
[43:48.800 --> 43:53.040]  my name is Haman Matlock with the Thomas Unified School District it's not easy
[43:53.040 --> 43:58.120]  going door-to-door making sure students are vaccinated your daughter is on
[43:58.120 --> 44:04.280]  independent study yeah Kayla has she been verified with her TDAP no okay we
[44:04.280 --> 44:08.200]  were coming today to give her a TDAP if she hasn't had it done yet
[44:08.200 --> 44:13.960]  Hamas Matlock dealing with a lot of sticky situations despite weeks of free
[44:13.960 --> 44:19.200]  clinics and warnings some the Thomas kids still had not received a shot for
[44:19.200 --> 44:23.320]  whooping cough there could be some family dynamics where they're having
[44:23.320 --> 44:28.240]  hardships in the home and this isn't the top priority in them making it day to
[44:28.240 --> 44:32.160]  day hello this is Haman Matlock with the Thomas Unified School District he has a
[44:32.160 --> 44:36.360]  list of more than 40 left to get vaccinated so with a traveling nurse on
[44:36.360 --> 44:40.240]  hand district officials are now left to track down kids who may be falling
[44:40.240 --> 44:43.400]  through the cracks there are a number of kids that we're finding out in our home
[44:43.400 --> 44:49.200]  visit today that are truant they aren't in school so this also gives us an
[44:49.200 --> 44:55.320]  opportunity to find out where those kids are that have truancy issues kids
[44:55.320 --> 45:01.800]  stop right there this is always the handbook scam as I've told you for 16
[45:01.800 --> 45:06.960]  years on air because I've been involved in the cases I've gone to the juvenile
[45:06.960 --> 45:11.760]  court hearings I've fought this it's something I had to pull out of because I
[45:11.760 --> 45:15.400]  can't physically go into these to these courts anymore because watching the
[45:15.400 --> 45:21.160]  judges the cops to watch the fraud the crying parents physically was giving me
[45:21.160 --> 45:26.280]  an ulcer watching children be abused is one thing I can't handle and it really
[45:26.280 --> 45:30.280]  gets I mean you think I get in a rage on air ladies and gentlemen the time I
[45:30.280 --> 45:33.360]  opened that door at the hospital room and the cop was choking the woman trying
[45:33.360 --> 45:36.000]  to make her sign documents to hand over the baby they were going to sell for
[45:36.000 --> 45:38.680]  three hundred four hundred thousand dollars little blonde-haired blue-eyed
[45:38.680 --> 45:43.840]  baby I I didn't do anything to the cop and I went outside and collapsed crying
[45:43.840 --> 45:48.480]  for about an hour and but I mean my I was just I mean watching a man attack a
[45:48.480 --> 45:53.120]  woman I was just like it was like but I knew that I'd be set up sent to prison
[45:53.120 --> 45:56.560]  couldn't keep fighting them so I just like I was like Robbie the robot cannot
[45:56.560 --> 46:00.520]  compute cannot compute cannot compute danger will Robinson danger you know
[46:00.520 --> 46:04.960]  smoke coming out my ears I mean I just can't I and these cops love it the
[46:04.960 --> 46:08.920]  judges get off on the pain it's like psychic vampires feeding hard and I
[46:08.920 --> 46:13.560]  just can't look at it I cannot enter a vampire pit I can sit up here far away
[46:13.560 --> 46:17.520]  from them and attack them and talk about them but I just I cannot get near
[46:17.520 --> 46:22.200]  them and it's not because of a cowardice either it's because I just I just I'd I
[46:22.200 --> 46:30.880]  want to pull a Samson on them with a with a jawbone now again we got to beat
[46:30.880 --> 46:35.000]  these people just like they have Dinecore admittedly being the number one
[46:35.000 --> 46:39.840]  CPS group their private contractors Dinecore runs child kidnapping rings
[46:39.840 --> 46:44.000]  worldwide don't believe me just search Dinecore white slavery Dinecore child
[46:44.000 --> 46:46.880]  trafficking back just just type it in for folks that are watching they won't
[46:46.880 --> 46:53.480]  believe it Dinecore sex trade Dinecore child trafficking you'll see BBC AP you
[46:53.480 --> 46:59.040]  name it now you notice he kept saying we're finding quite a few truancies as
[46:59.040 --> 47:08.080]  well they mix that in there saying the parents are criminal and so what happens
[47:08.080 --> 47:12.120]  is they have a kind of an in-between homeschooling in many states like
[47:12.120 --> 47:21.920]  California the parents say you're not gonna vaccinate my daughter and because
[47:21.920 --> 47:27.280]  of that they'll say all right we're gonna do at home schooling so they just do
[47:27.280 --> 47:30.640]  their school there and then turn it in once a week because the parents don't
[47:30.640 --> 47:33.480]  know there's a waiver they've been intimidated into well then I will pull my
[47:33.480 --> 47:37.040]  child out of school or I will start homeschooling so now they're coming to
[47:37.040 --> 47:41.400]  those houses saying and and you know treating them like they're criminals and
[47:41.400 --> 47:51.080]  then mixing the quote crime of truancy in with the
[47:51.080 --> 47:55.680]  inoculation that's how they claim it's the law when it's the school saying you
[47:55.680 --> 47:59.640]  can't be here it's the law when there's not a law they kick you out then trigger
[47:59.640 --> 48:05.160]  the cops all consciously knowing it's a scam in every school district it's it's
[48:05.160 --> 48:10.200]  just a criminal culture of lying and hoaxing Rick Perry did it he said it's
[48:10.200 --> 48:13.800]  the law you got to guard a cell and we got up and said no it's not and the
[48:13.800 --> 48:17.400]  legislature said you know there's not a law Perry you went on me and the
[48:17.400 --> 48:23.200]  executive order well get me a law then let's let's put that up nine-core child
[48:23.200 --> 48:27.320]  trafficking and you know the Chicago Tribune was there on the list you see
[48:27.320 --> 48:35.400]  prison planet you see Wikipedia you see Chicago Tribune right there US stalls on
[48:35.400 --> 48:39.880]  human trafficking yeah I remember that Chicago Tribune that's where the US
[48:39.880 --> 48:43.600]  government in Congress said they're allowed to run kids there's Catherine
[48:43.600 --> 48:48.400]  Austin Fitz exposing dying core CPS and trafficking and then there's the dying
[48:48.400 --> 48:52.160]  core exposed for trafficking women and children that's congressional testimony
[48:52.160 --> 48:58.280]  you might want to watch that there's a bunch of pediatric websites cop watch
[48:58.280 --> 49:03.560]  has it so you better learn this is a hardcore army of hardcore child
[49:03.560 --> 49:08.760]  kidnappers well of course who else would act like this this is who they've
[49:08.760 --> 49:13.680]  recruited one of the few things I get big death threats over is dying core they
[49:13.680 --> 49:18.200]  do not like me talking about this look I'm sorry if I am a coward and don't
[49:18.200 --> 49:22.160]  stand up to you then the blood of these children is on my hands you're flying
[49:22.160 --> 49:27.120]  out of the country and I will not be part of it you understand that justice

[49:51.160 --> 49:55.920]  can do they'll go back to the filthy TV show with them

[50:00.360 --> 50:05.560]  negligent parents are put on notice the Natomas district is going to extremes and
[50:05.560 --> 50:13.960]  putting up with extremes to keep kids from getting sick kids won't be allowed
[50:13.960 --> 50:17.240]  back to school Monday if they haven't been vaccinated the district will
[50:17.240 --> 50:23.720]  continue door-to-door visits until everyone is vaccinated till everybody's
[50:23.720 --> 50:31.240]  conned everybody's scammed oh god I get mad and a rage because of the abuse
[50:31.240 --> 50:41.280]  people are going through but also because I'm sick of it it's so obvious
[50:41.280 --> 50:46.240]  it's so criminal just like I last night I covered it it's now come out and
[50:46.240 --> 50:48.960]  confirmed everything we said government admits it they were directly
[50:48.960 --> 50:53.880]  shipping the guns to the Mexican cartel Sena Loa who they then let ship the
[50:53.880 --> 50:58.120]  drugs in that was even on Fox and news last night I mean the government is
[50:58.120 --> 51:02.280]  drug-dealing murderers we have I mean come on attention gardeners this is an
[51:02.280 --> 51:06.760]  urgent GCN self-reliance update GCN has just discovered a new bioactive
[51:06.760 --> 51:10.240]  superfood for garden plants flowers and herbs it's called proto grow and it's

[54:42.160 --> 54:49.080]  mean I can pull up right now New York Daily News from five years ago this is
[54:49.080 --> 54:52.760]  without looking if I go look I'll find more whatever I can imagine it's there
[54:52.760 --> 54:56.240]  anything you can imagine the globalist doing it they're doing it where they
[54:56.240 --> 54:59.960]  take little kids especially in New York and they it's always the same they tell
[54:59.960 --> 55:02.200]  the mother we're going to take the two-year-old if you don't give us the
[55:02.200 --> 55:06.360]  seven-year-old and actually take them and chain them down and test pesticides
[55:06.360 --> 55:11.960]  and drugs on them till they die and then CPS workers went we're delivering kids
[55:11.960 --> 55:18.000]  to a big pharma facility and they're dying I've been there they're begging
[55:18.000 --> 55:21.560]  for their lives chained down healthy kids they're killing them and the
[55:21.560 --> 55:24.240]  government came out and said we're going to keep killing them just like
[55:24.240 --> 55:28.160]  Rumsfeld Cynthia McKinney's up there bringing it up hey DineCorp runs kids
[55:28.160 --> 55:34.000]  and he just says well they're you know they're allowed to and then I saw Bill
[55:34.000 --> 55:37.920]  O'Reilly last week I saw a clip online he said the US never bombed any country
[55:37.920 --> 55:43.320]  in the Middle East for 9-11 and I saw a clip of him last night online we're
[55:43.320 --> 55:47.480]  about a minute from the night before but I saw it last night where O'Reilly was
[55:47.480 --> 55:54.040]  saying that how dare Cynthia McKinney say that Kennedy was killed in a military
[55:54.040 --> 55:59.480]  coup how dare this traitor to America say this overseas I mean how dare she
[55:59.480 --> 56:03.840]  think what 92% of Americans think in most polls
[56:06.360 --> 56:13.400]  you see it's not seen as polite to talk about these issues you're just supposed
[56:13.400 --> 56:16.800]  to well the government's good oh the government's red white and blue no the
[56:16.800 --> 56:20.840]  government is a collection of criminals that have come in and taken over our
[56:20.840 --> 56:27.560]  country and wrapped their tyranny in the American flag and I've had enough of it
[56:27.560 --> 56:33.760]  and I wanted to stop and our naivete has allowed this to get worse and worse and
[56:33.760 --> 56:38.440]  worse to the point of now they're coming to doors in California Mississippi
[56:38.440 --> 56:43.680]  West Virginia other states saying it's the law to take shots when it's not and
[56:43.680 --> 56:46.880]  I've had enough of it ladies and gentlemen had enough of these criminals
[56:46.880 --> 56:52.880]  all you got to do is expose them and it's over you know the TSA wants to
[56:52.880 --> 56:55.840]  destroy air traffic in this country that's why I talked to truck drivers I
[56:55.840 --> 56:59.920]  looked up the different travel agencies they admit groups that study it that
[56:59.920 --> 57:03.520]  bus travel is up more than double the last ten years I was out on a road trip
[57:03.520 --> 57:08.200]  last week and just saw buses everywhere I've talked to truck drivers they say oh
[57:08.200 --> 57:10.880]  yeah you see a lot more buses now people using buses because they don't want to
[57:10.880 --> 57:14.280]  be groped well the Fed just said they're gonna go to the bus stations now so the
[57:14.280 --> 57:17.680]  feds want to destroy air travel and nationalize it but they don't want to
[57:17.680 --> 57:22.960]  get the blame for it they want to just quietly wreck it and wreck tourism this
[57:22.960 --> 57:26.040]  mission accomplished when we lose 40 billion dollars a year and tourists not
[57:26.040 --> 57:31.040]  coming here because it's such a police state the globalist want to post
[57:31.040 --> 57:34.680]  industrial America they want to wreck it to make you dependent they want you poor
[57:34.680 --> 57:41.480]  so you're too busy trying to earn a living they don't like uppity people we

[01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:59.080]  stuff yesterday but said I couldn't talk about it today he said I might want to
[01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:02.920]  talk about it he'll make the decision we'll talk about it later in the hour if
[01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:06.480]  he wants to governor good to have you here with us great Alex always a pleasure
[01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:11.640]  to be here it's ugly rainy weather today up in Minnesota so that's why I agreed to
[01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:21.640]  do an hour with you because I can't play golf I know you're very very nice sir
[01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:26.520]  before we get into all the serious issues now your wife Terry is so great it
[01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:30.360]  was great seeing her out at your birthday party in Los Angeles but yesterday I
[01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:33.480]  called up and I go yeah Jesse said call money to get him on this week she said oh
[01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:37.240]  great well he's on the elliptic and the dogs on the treadmill they watch sports
[01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:40.680]  together and I said my god that'd be the ultimate sports center video and she
[01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:45.120]  goes no no no no he getting mad at me and I said no I'm just joking but but you
[01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:50.760]  got to tell us about your dog and about the treadmill action well it's you know
[01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:55.360]  I always like to keep myself in shape you know I try to do that I think it's
[01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:59.720]  even more important as you get older to continue to train and you know keep you
[01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:04.680]  physically in shape as much as you can and so I try to work out light with
[01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:08.440]  weights in the morning and then I do the elliptic machine after and right now I
[01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:13.440]  do six miles at a pop on it you know which is pretty good and you know my
[01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:19.600]  dog when I first started training he loves to participate in anything that I
[01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:24.760]  do and wants to be around me or my wife constantly and so he immediately looked
[01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:28.600]  like what do I do doing all this and he got up on the treadmill and we turned it
[01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:32.560]  on with no training at all and he now runs on the treadmill while I do the
[01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:37.160]  elliptic machine and and of course I got a TV screen in there and if the young and
[01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:41.040]  the rest was on we watch that if it's before that we watch the prices right
[01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:45.800]  or we watch Sports Center depending on what time of the day it is but yeah he
[01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:49.520]  trains with me every morning and it's kind of nice to be able to do that and
[01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:53.360]  even when the weather gets bad here in Minnesota that's what's good about it we
[01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:58.040]  can train indoors so it's a it's a good thing and you know dogs will adapt to
[01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:01.960]  treadmills I don't think though if they if they allowed to be introduced to them
[01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:07.320]  in a good manner and not get frightened of them in any way so you perform a dog who
[01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:10.600]  run on a treadmill and it's a great way to keep them in shape and like under these
[01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:15.320]  days like today in Minnesota when it's raining out all day saves you from having
[01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:19.880]  to go outside well especially a prize German Shepherd now now now he has a
[01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:25.720]  public name and then he has his real name but this is a I mean this is a well
[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:29.040]  trained German Shepherd really smart oh yeah well actually he's not a German
[01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:33.040]  Shepherd he's a Belgian Malinois okay looks like a German Shepherd to me I'm
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:37.920]  ignorant well no you're not ignorant they look very much alike because years and
[01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:42.520]  years ago the German Shepherd I believe came out of the Belgian Malinois he's
[01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:46.680]  just called a Belgian Shepherd you have a German Shepherd and a Belgian Shepherd
[01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:51.240]  and they're slightly different that the Belgians a little bit smaller doesn't
[01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:55.160]  get the hip displacement problems because your German Shepherds are big
[01:03:55.160 --> 01:04:00.880]  you know they get 90 to 110 pounds or more and any dog that gets that big is
[01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:05.080]  going to have the problem of the hip displacement stuff or run the risk of it
[01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:09.320]  not saying they all will but they run a greater risk where the Belgian Shepherd
[01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:15.000]  is about 75 between 70 and 80 pounds and that that 20 pounds difference can make
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:18.600]  all the difference apparently between the hip trouble you know and then of
[01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:23.200]  course a lot of it could be hereditary too is a dexter looking up at you right
[01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:28.160]  now governor no he's upstairs sleeping he did his treadmill this morning so
[01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:33.960]  along with me so now he's taking a break while I talk to you how many miles
[01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:38.600]  of this did the Belgian Shepherd do I usually put him on there for about a
[01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:43.000]  half hour to 45 minutes you know I don't keep track of the miles I just set it
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.680]  at a particular pace and let him go for 30 to 45 minutes it gives him good
[01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:51.200]  exercise incredible wow alright governor stay there we're coming back to the full
[01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:56.600]  audience we're going to get into a host of issues election 2012 the TSA and more
[01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:59.600]  with Jesse Ventura
[01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:06.320]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:11.720]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that
[01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:15.280]  we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've turned the
[01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:20.040]  members influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the
[01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:25.160]  sharks I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:29.720]  attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:34.400]  offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes

[01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:42.120]  asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to
[01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:47.200]  today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen

[01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:08.760]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:13.080]  bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your
[01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:17.040]  electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:21.400]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:25.720]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:29.480]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:33.600]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:37.600]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power

[01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:44.080]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution from

[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:26.520]  okay former Minnesota governor Jesse Ventura is our gas New York Times best
[01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:30.520]  selling author I don't know four or five times over his latest book by the way is
[01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:35.080]  available at mfallwars.com 63 documents the government doesn't want you to read
[01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:38.320]  he's got some new books coming out as well we'll see if we can get him to talk
[01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:43.480]  about that third season of the hit TV show that I think it's had a lot of
[01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:49.760]  courage conspiracy theory getting into Rex 84 FEMA camps the whole nine yards
[01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:54.040]  we're gonna talk to him about election 2012 he's got some breaking comments on
[01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:59.600]  that that he relayed to me yesterday that are certainly newsworthy also we're
[01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:04.520]  going to be looking at the TSA as much as he can say about his lawsuit that the
[01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:09.000]  judge still hasn't ruled on we're talking about a long period of time here
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:14.760]  that's all coming up but out of the gates first with Governor Ventura some
[01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:19.760]  breaking news yesterday and I've actually gotten some calls about this
[01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:23.200]  separately but I couldn't confirm it but I do see that there are some
[01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:30.800]  publications here that are talking about it and the production company has
[01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:37.400]  told Ventura that it's true so if it isn't true it's an elaborate hoax but
[01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:40.400]  Governor Ventura you want to tell folks what's going on with the TV show
[01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:44.320]  well we're in the middle of production of our third season and you know we've
[01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:49.960]  settled on eight more conspiracies some of them very bizarre it's going to be an
[01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:54.840]  interesting year we've changed personnel a little bit we've brought on board my
[01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:59.760]  son Tyrell who will now be on camera last year he was simply off camera and
[01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:05.040]  working behind the scenes as a producer he's a good-looking kid and belongs in
[01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:09.400]  front of the camera he hates it he wants to be behind it but like everybody
[01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:13.960]  they may succeed at something that they don't generally isn't the first choice
[01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:21.600]  but my son's coming on screen this year with me along with along with Sean
[01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:26.560]  Stone who is a very bright young man the graduate of Princeton and happens to be
[01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:31.960]  the son of Oliver Stone so that can only spell trouble when you see Ventura's
[01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:37.280]  teaming up with stones it can only be trouble for our government because I'm
[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:42.440]  a great admirer of Oliver Stone and his son Sean is a chip off the old block you
[01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:46.400]  know the apple doesn't fall far from the tree he's a brilliantly smart young man
[01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:51.120]  and I'm gonna he's kind of introverted I'm gonna jump on the show to make him a
[01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:56.400]  little more extroverted by the time we're done but what's happened Alex we're
[01:10:56.400 --> 01:11:01.760]  in production right now and we were doing a very controversial show that
[01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:08.200]  involves the Dr. Fred Bell who is the brother of the famous radio man Hart Bell
[01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:14.440]  and he did a controversial interview with me just a day or two ago three days
[01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:21.040]  ago whatever it was and he's staying here in Minneapolis and within 24 to 36
[01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:27.040]  hours later he's talked at this hotel now I see some YouTube videos on this so
[01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:30.520]  it's broken and I see godlike productions talking about it you know
[01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:35.240]  asking if it's true you say the production company believes it's true and
[01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:40.760]  I know you've been investigating and so we're still on a hundred percent confirmed
[01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:47.240]  on this but certainly it's out there now and I mean Jesse specifically I know
[01:11:47.240 --> 01:11:50.360]  you well because you probably don't want to get into what you were talking to him
[01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:55.360]  about or perhaps you do but we need to find out if this is true or not yeah
[01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:59.640]  absolutely you know I I'm going under the assumption that it is because like I
[01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:03.480]  said I had a conference call with my production company out in Los Angeles
[01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:09.080]  yesterday and they were all speaking that it absolutely positively that Dr. Fred
[01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:15.600]  Bell is indeed dead tragically a very interesting man to talk to to say the
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:20.760]  least very well read man an exceptionally educated man he's he's a
[01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:25.200]  direct inline descendant of Alexander Graham Bell I didn't know if you do that
[01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:29.800]  no I didn't yeah he's a direct descendant of him you know and obviously
[01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:35.960]  with the same last name Dr. Fred Bell and or at least that's what he told me and
[01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:42.600]  I can only take him as a man of his word he's very much and has been involved in
[01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:50.280]  many U.S. government operations both as a consultant and who knows what else and
[01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:54.000]  he told me some very interesting things that will be revealed on the show which
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:59.760]  I'm not at liberty to reveal right now but it is if he did if it's just a
[01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:04.480]  simply tragic circumstantial happening that he happened to do these
[01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:09.960]  controversial interviews with me and then within 48 hours is dead I don't know
[01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:14.560]  I don't know if there's more to it I can't make any statement that there is
[01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:19.000]  or isn't at this time it may be just circumstance it may have been just his
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:24.800]  time to go I don't know but in the words of Colonel Alex Fletcher Proudy who I
[01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:29.600]  now hold deeply to me all the time Proudy said nothing just happens
[01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:34.800]  everything is planned and so that always rings in the back of my mind a little
[01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:39.040]  Alex but I don't want to put anything more into it he may have just simply
[01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:45.880]  that was his last day on earth I don't know certainly but good seems very
[01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:52.120]  strange that that that he would he would leave this planet after in less than
[01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:58.080]  48 hours after doing an explosive interview with me you've told me the
[01:13:58.080 --> 01:14:02.200]  topic off air and that's what makes it even more creepy because I have seen a
[01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:10.280]  lot of strange things happening around that particular topic but I guess we'll
[01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:15.160]  just leave it at that yeah yeah you know Dr. Fred Bell brother to brother to
[01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:19.080]  Art Bell you know everyone knows him from I believe coast to coast right yes
[01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:23.000]  with Art Bell probably one of the biggest radio shows in the United States
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:30.000]  history and Fred Bell was an exceptional bright scientist type
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:35.800]  extremely smart man and the things some of the things he revealed me was his
[01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:41.680]  intimate dealings with US government on many many highly top-secret type
[01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:47.520]  operations and top-secret type projects that were probably even way beyond what
[01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:54.840]  I was as a Navy SEAL you know I would be down the Navy SEALs are down at the
[01:14:54.840 --> 01:15:00.800]  knuckle-dragger level we are we're the ones that go out and physically do the
[01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:05.920]  jobs Dr. Bell would be at a level where those are the brain trusts the way up
[01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:11.680]  there that eventually can lead to some SEAL type operations certainly but you
[01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:15.680]  know he's up in the in the in the stratosphere beyond anything that I
[01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:20.240]  would have ever been even close to with my top-secret security clearance when I
[01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:23.920]  was in the Navy and we know there's a lot of other shadow stuff going on like
[01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:26.880]  when you had just become governor and they called you down in the Capitol
[01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:31.920]  basement and there were 23 CIA agents well not really I agreed to do it they
[01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:37.400]  they called it a call a they listed it as a classroom thing that's what it
[01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:42.880]  officially was called and they asked if I would be participated in it so it
[01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:47.440]  wasn't that sneaky Pete I mean I could have turned them down Alex it wasn't
[01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:51.400]  that I was required to but it peaked my interest and I thought this will be
[01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:55.040]  interesting sure but it goes to your point that I know you've made that they
[01:15:55.040 --> 01:16:01.160]  look like your neighbor oh yeah without a doubt without a doubt and there's a lot
[01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:04.960]  more to this story that as it progresses I don't want to say anything
[01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:10.280]  right now Alex of anything behind the scenes that I know but I'll just say
[01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:15.600]  this he told me some very provocative things that I think that I will have to
[01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:25.880]  go to the police with things that he told me in our interview off the air that I
[01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:31.440]  think that I will have to let the local police know what he told me Wow so yeah
[01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:34.840]  because yesterday when you told me about this you said don't you know don't get
[01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:37.800]  into it we're not gonna talk about it but then this morning right before you
[01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:41.240]  came on you said you know what I think I'm gonna have to talk about this and
[01:16:41.240 --> 01:16:44.920]  then we had to go live so I think that's what you were alluding to is that is
[01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:48.120]  that this is stuff you're not going to be able to keep quiet about well you know
[01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:52.960]  but my first obligation is to inform the authorities of what was said to me yes
[01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:57.000]  they're not the general public yes now that makes sense then after that point
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:02.640]  we'll see what happens from there but I do want to talk to them well this is
[01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:06.320]  certainly a big deal Tyrell I know is having to come in from California to
[01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:12.320]  deal with us yeah yeah and well whether it's a big deal or not we don't know you
[01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:17.280]  know it may be tragically that the man just died Alex it could be as simple as
[01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:20.960]  that too well as bad as it is let's let's let's hope with the lesser of the
[01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:25.240]  evils as it progresses also keep in touch and let you know well thank you
[01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:30.520]  sir now let's shift gears into speaking of Navy SEALs that when we first had you
[01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:34.880]  on last time the whole Navy SEAL thing had just happened and you did say it was
[01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:41.640]  suspicious to you I have talked to the father of a Navy SEAL known by my family
[01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:46.160]  for about 18 years and I mean they'd be you know I don't want to get too much into
[01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:49.200]  it and give it away but I've seen the photos I've had family that's met the
[01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:55.880]  Navy SEAL he was friends with one of the people that was in fact let's skip this
[01:17:55.880 --> 01:18:00.320]  network break coming up he was friends well actually I was told not to give
[01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:05.520]  too much away the point is is that the SEALs do believe and I have this from
[01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:09.400]  another source as well from from the wife of a SEAL but this is directly known
[01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:15.680]  by by me yeah that that they were put on that helicopter that blew up that killed
[01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:21.240]  the 20-something SEALs and that it was a National Guard helicopter that they
[01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:24.080]  thought something was weird that they never put that many on the same
[01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:29.200]  helicopter and and that they believe that a bomb was put on board and then
[01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:32.720]  their only question is did Al Qaeda do it or wasn't the government but but but
[01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:37.520]  they think there's foul play and that some of the SEALs on there were not
[01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:41.120]  just in SEAL Team 6 they were all SEAL Team 6 but that they had been on the
[01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:45.120]  bin Laden raid well first of all Alex let me correct you on something all the
[01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:50.160]  bin Laden raid SEALs were from SEAL Team 6 no no I know I'm talking about the
[01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:54.800]  helicopter that later right right but but but all the SEALs that were on the
[01:18:54.800 --> 01:19:00.200]  bin Laden raid were from SEAL Team 6 and as I understand it all the SEALs that
[01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:05.280]  were on this helicopter likewise were from SEAL Team 6 yes sir that's what I'm
[01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:10.760]  saying and there were more there were like 22 of them yes and the question is
[01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:15.160]  and I know where you're going with this because I thought about it also the
[01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:20.240]  question is were the same SEALs that were on the bin Laden raid on this
[01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:25.160]  helicopter and that unfortunately I don't know if we'll ever know because no
[01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:30.200]  one's even gonna know who the bin Laden SEALs were okay I do know this is what
[01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:34.360]  I'm telling you and this is dangerous information okay and again this is
[01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:39.160]  directly because I don't know you know all I know is it's a speculation that I
[01:19:39.160 --> 01:19:42.920]  took was oh boy the 22 SEALs that went down in this
[01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:46.520]  helo were they the bin Laden SEALs and would they have done that to shut them
[01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:50.360]  up well let's look at this from this perspective governor and then I'm gonna
[01:19:50.360 --> 01:19:54.200]  tell you what I was told and I want to get your expert opinion on this and
[01:19:54.200 --> 01:19:59.400]  again I when I got you on as a guest I hadn't even thought to bring this up so
[01:19:59.400 --> 01:20:02.200]  it just popped in my head now so I'm going back to the data so it'll take me
[01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:10.720]  just a second to be exact here what I was told through a wife of a SEAL who was
[01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:15.760]  not in SEAL Team 6 but it is currently serving was that the SEALs got on the
[01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:19.880]  helicopter at the bin Laden raid this is what witnesses all saw and that it blew
[01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:23.480]  up and had some type of bomb on it they didn't blow it up or that they were
[01:20:23.480 --> 01:20:26.520]  killed and that Pakistani military came and got the bodies and got the
[01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:30.160]  helicopter that has since come out on Pakistani TV and that was that big
[01:20:30.160 --> 01:20:34.360]  diplomatic row and fight with their governments but that was just from this
[01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:39.960]  wife of a Navy SEAL and I confirmed she was who she said she was but I let me
[01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:46.520]  interject something though Alex SEAL Team 6 is so secretive wives don't even
[01:20:46.520 --> 01:20:49.120]  know about it Bob is gonna go further though that's what I'm telling you
[01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:53.520]  because no let me explain I have a friend who was on SEAL Team 6 and his wife
[01:20:53.520 --> 01:21:00.880]  had no idea that he was well that's all secretive Team 6 is no I understand don't
[01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:06.560]  even know if their husbands are on that team so I would be a bit skeptical of
[01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:11.520]  your information of you know John that basis alone well listen that's why I
[01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:16.480]  was saying I didn't go with that info because I couldn't confirm that in this
[01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:22.720]  other case this is a current SEAL who has a friend who is in SEAL Team 6 he was
[01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:27.360]  not in the helicopter the second helicopter that went down but that what
[01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:31.520]  he said is the SEALs are angry and think that either Al Qaeda or somebody else
[01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:35.480]  set them up put them on the National Guard helicopter and then it was some
[01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:40.120]  type of assassination so that's the info I have and that is directly from the
[01:21:40.120 --> 01:21:44.840]  father of the Navy SEAL okay I can't comment on that really because I know
[01:21:44.840 --> 01:21:56.320]  nothing about that but I don't know I guess all I can say is Alex and light of the stuff I do and the information I've gathered doing my TV show and the other things I've looked at
[01:21:56.320 --> 01:22:04.040]  nothing is beyond I don't put anything past anyone anymore so I'm not gonna say
[01:22:04.040 --> 01:22:10.120]  this could be true or couldn't be true but I certainly wouldn't say that it it's
[01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:15.600]  not so I can't say that that it very well could be who knows let me ask you
[01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:21.160]  that's where I'm at now Alex I don't trust my government at all I mean I just
[01:22:21.160 --> 01:22:26.640]  happened the other morning to watch the movie on Pat Tillman again and every time
[01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:30.640]  I watch that movie and I recommend people it's on showtime now I think or
[01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:36.480]  whatever called the Pat Tillman story I urge people to watch this and watch and
[01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:42.360]  see how despicable our government was in the death of Pat Tillman and the
[01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:47.280]  worst part about it is the very end when all these generals and big shots are
[01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:54.320]  brought in front of Congress and they say I can't recall over 90 times over 90
[01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:59.000]  times in their testimony these guys obviously are suffering from bad cases
[01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:05.360]  of Alzheimer's and I say that sarcastically naturally but at 90
[01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:11.280]  sometimes I watched the Pat Tillman show and I just feel with anger the Pat
[01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:16.960]  Tillman story so I do not trust my government at all today I don't trust
[01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:21.400]  the word that comes out of them they're a major pack of liars I don't think I
[01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:25.600]  could be any more blunt than that oh I think you I think you hit the nail on
[01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:30.400]  the head I mean take private Lynch with five of her team suddenly got killed
[01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:33.800]  when they came out and said that she wasn't the hero they said it was a PR
[01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:38.080]  stunt to get women in front line combat and they did the fake raid that Jerry
[01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:43.120]  Brookheimer directed via satellite on the hospital where they said hey come
[01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:47.600]  get her and the Iraqis had pulled out two days before the Iraqi military you
[01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:50.560]  have Pat Tillman basically being assassinated to cover up of that that
[01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:55.280]  you were just that you were just alluding to but specifically Governor
[01:23:55.280 --> 01:24:01.200]  Jesse Ventura underwater demolition team Navy SEAL a whole nine yards when you
[01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:09.000]  heard that members of SEAL team six a part of the same unit went down the
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:13.600]  the biggest one-day loss of life in the ten-year history of the Afghan war and
[01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:20.400]  it just so happens to be the Navy SEALs and as God is my witness talking to the
[01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:24.520]  father of a Navy SEAL that my family's known for a long time I'll just leave it
[01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:30.520]  at that okay it says yes my son is good friends with somebody in six and he
[01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:36.160]  told him that the whole team thinks that either Al Qaeda put a bomb on it but
[01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:39.600]  then they think it might be the government because it was real weird how
[01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:42.760]  they were all put on this junky helicopter they you know never use these
[01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:46.000]  National Guard helicopters and they usually split them up and they thought
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:51.400]  the whole thing was suspicious and and and and and yeah remember this Alex
[01:24:51.400 --> 01:24:55.640]  that's the first thing you look for in conspiracy and government don't I'll
[01:24:55.640 --> 01:24:59.440]  just state this and I have no knowledge what you're telling me I can't add to it
[01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:05.080]  I can't say you're right or wrong but I will say this in all of my dealings and
[01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:09.160]  in doing conspiracy theory and writing my book and doing everything I've been
[01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:13.640]  doing in the last over decade now the thing you always look for with
[01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:19.440]  government is when there's a violation of standard operating procedures when
[01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:24.920]  government violates a procedure that they normally won't do whatever it might
[01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:29.440]  be and believe me it's that way in the military it's that way in regular
[01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:33.760]  government everything government does is done under up standard operating
[01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:38.640]  procedures when those are violated that's your first sign that something is
[01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:43.440]  in kosher that's your first sign that you may have a cover-up that you may have
[01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:47.960]  a conspiracy if you want to call it that whatever name you want to give to it
[01:25:47.960 --> 01:25:52.160]  but the first thing you look for is a violation of standard operating
[01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:57.200]  procedures so if your seal is giving you the information that they report on a
[01:25:57.200 --> 01:26:02.240]  helicopter that they don't normally fly and if they and if you have this that
[01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:07.280]  whatever and if things didn't seem normal and very odd of sorts for what
[01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:12.320]  they were being asked to do because let me put it to you this way the seals
[01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:18.760]  today have unlimited money listen that's exactly that's exactly what the
[01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:23.400]  father said we used to Alex we used to have to big bow and steal back in the
[01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:28.960]  Vietnam days because it was because we weren't the number one unit then as far
[01:26:28.960 --> 01:26:33.760]  as guerrilla warfare not in the guerrilla warfare community but the focus of the
[01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:39.800]  general military back then was on conventional military today that focus
[01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:45.640]  has changed because conventional military today is obsolete today it's on
[01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:50.320]  small unit tactics and guerrilla warfare which is the seals are the best
[01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:55.920]  also add in the Delta Force who is very good the green berets the list goes on
[01:26:55.920 --> 01:27:02.440]  and on of the small unit guys and what they do but so it seems strange to me
[01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:07.080]  that today when the seals have unlimited money and resources at their
[01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:11.920]  disposal that they would all of a sudden put them on a helicopter that isn't one
[01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:15.560]  of theirs they all are working together with their
[01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:20.080]  helo pilots their boat drivers that all took place after the fiasco in the
[01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:25.080]  desert of the Iran hostage raid remember that one sure the Delta Force
[01:27:25.080 --> 01:27:30.400]  everything got all screwed up well that changed everything at that point and it
[01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:35.080]  changed it to the better to where they put the helo pilots the boat drivers are
[01:27:35.080 --> 01:27:39.800]  all under the same command and they work with the teams every day well that's
[01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:43.800]  what I was going to say that's exactly what the father was saying I was just
[01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:47.800]  crystallizing it but they said standard operating procedure wasn't followed they
[01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:51.880]  used equipment they never used they used a junkie National Guard helicopter the
[01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:55.880]  mission was weird they asked them why are we going out to this site then they
[01:27:55.880 --> 01:27:59.280]  said it was field team six that was involved in the bin Laden raid in Reuters
[01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:03.880]  then they said it wasn't then they said they were going to after Taliban in a
[01:28:03.880 --> 01:28:07.640]  rescue mission then it wasn't that was the whole point was the whole thing was
[01:28:07.640 --> 01:28:12.760]  a lie and that quote he and again they couldn't believe their own government
[01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:17.600]  did it so they said it says if Al Qaeda was like had a mole or something and
[01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:22.480]  had put a bomb on there well I think that's giving Al Qaeda a lot more
[01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:27.920]  credit sure sure but the seals are then having to wonder then I mean what
[01:28:27.920 --> 01:28:33.120]  happened you know again Alex I can only state that I don't trust that my
[01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:38.120]  government officials at all today not one bit let me ask you this what did you
[01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:41.840]  think the minute you heard that helicopter blew up well naturally it
[01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:47.400]  gutted me because it's my teammates it's my people you know it doesn't matter if
[01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:53.060]  you're an underwater demolition guy from World War two or the most elite guy on
[01:28:53.060 --> 01:28:59.120]  seal team six today we are one fraternity we are an elite fraternity of
[01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:04.600]  very special men who go through the most difficult training in the world in
[01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:10.760]  hopes of being the best sailor we can be and defend our country and so what
[01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:15.760]  happens to me when I hear that I cry because when they die a little bit of
[01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:21.640]  me dies that's how that's how tight we are and it doesn't matter through
[01:29:21.640 --> 01:29:27.200]  generations I'm class 58 and today they're up to class I don't know 290 to
[01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:32.800]  something or other way up but I don't even know but it doesn't matter we are
[01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:38.120]  all brothers and so when when when the seals die I cry it hurts
[01:29:38.120 --> 01:29:41.820]  all right governor powerful information stay there I want to get into 2012
[01:29:41.820 --> 01:29:45.200]  election and more straight ahead

[01:33:28.160 --> 01:33:32.680]  it looks just like Oliver Stone and really smart guy of course and another
[01:33:32.680 --> 01:33:37.640]  great director and his own right and researcher Tyrell Ventura another chip
[01:33:37.640 --> 01:33:44.520]  off the old block so certainly the next generation of tyranny fighters with the
[01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:48.520]  show conspiracy theory Jesse when you get him on never talks about his books
[01:33:48.520 --> 01:33:52.160]  but I would add that you support Jesse and his work and our work when you get
[01:33:52.160 --> 01:33:58.280]  him from us it's Jesse Ventura with Dick Russell this is a great book 63
[01:33:58.280 --> 01:34:01.560]  documents the government doesn't want you to read available discounted in
[01:34:01.560 --> 01:34:06.520]  full wars calm and of course his last book American conspiracies long before
[01:34:06.520 --> 01:34:10.040]  this one but Dick Russell is also excellent before he leaves us we'll
[01:34:10.040 --> 01:34:14.280]  talk about some of the new books that are scheduled to be coming out as well
[01:34:14.280 --> 01:34:21.560]  but Jesse finishing up before we get into TSA before we get into do all these
[01:34:21.560 --> 01:34:26.000]  other subjects during the break you were you were saying something a little
[01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:31.120]  more a light bulb was going off from your underwater demolition Navy Seal days
[01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:36.920]  about the 22 crammed on with 12 others on board that helicopter well the light
[01:34:36.920 --> 01:34:40.720]  bubbles again like we talked about Alex standard operating procedures and
[01:34:40.720 --> 01:34:45.960]  generally a standard operating procedure to the best of my knowledge in the
[01:34:45.960 --> 01:34:53.440]  SEALs is it's one platoon per hero and a platoon is 12 enlisted in two
[01:34:53.440 --> 01:34:58.920]  officers so clearly that there was a if that's true there was a violation of
[01:34:58.920 --> 01:35:03.480]  standard operating procedure right there there were too many SEALs on board one
[01:35:03.480 --> 01:35:07.760]  specific helicopter normally they would have divided that into two to three
[01:35:07.760 --> 01:35:12.960]  helos that is exactly what the father said his son the Navy SEAL said and
[01:35:12.960 --> 01:35:18.240]  again I know the family sure well then things haven't changed that much because
[01:35:18.240 --> 01:35:22.560]  I've been out for 40 years you know but it's still pretty much the same rules
[01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:28.400]  would apply I would imagine well it's just incredible that the entire SOP was
[01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:33.120]  different and then it just so happens to be able to be SEAL Team 6 just just
[01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:38.480]  again the biggest one-day loss in troops and I'll tell you the sad part about it
[01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:44.440]  being SEAL Team 6 these are all career men you're not gonna find a guy on SEAL
[01:35:44.440 --> 01:35:48.840]  Team 6 that's wet behind the ears and just left high school or college a year
[01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:54.200]  ago these are all combat seasoned veterans probably with two to three to
[01:35:54.200 --> 01:36:02.160]  four tours to Iraq and Afghanistan on regular SEAL teams you know and so SEAL
[01:36:02.160 --> 01:36:07.680]  Team 6 are guys that are have been specially selected to do that type of
[01:36:07.680 --> 01:36:13.640]  work not that all the SEALs are could potentially be qualified for SEAL Team
[01:36:13.640 --> 01:36:20.760]  6 certainly but but six is basically made up of you you're not gonna find
[01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:24.960]  many 22 year olds I don't believe in Team 6 most of the guys are gonna be
[01:36:24.960 --> 01:36:31.160]  between a probably 27 32 years old and they've survived a lot of deadly
[01:36:31.160 --> 01:36:36.520]  missions absolutely only to be blown out of the sky to keep something secret I
[01:36:36.520 --> 01:36:40.080]  mean it's come out now that the bin Laden thing they had a fake situation
[01:36:40.080 --> 01:36:44.760]  room photo they lied and said Obama was watching it they lied and said they had
[01:36:44.760 --> 01:36:49.120]  live feeds they lied through him in the water let's take it all the way back
[01:36:49.120 --> 01:36:53.200]  then let's take the lies to where they go back to and that's George Bush and
[01:36:53.200 --> 01:36:58.680]  these whole wars to begin with yes you know let's not let him off the hook
[01:36:58.680 --> 01:37:05.000]  either because he's the one that put us in these wars he's the one 9-11 happened
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:09.800]  on his watch and so to me it goes back to Cheney Bush
[01:37:09.800 --> 01:37:14.680]  over that whole cast of characters even more so than Barack Obama certainly look
[01:37:14.680 --> 01:37:19.000]  I don't I've exposed them but at the end of the day Barack Obama saying I don't
[01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:22.920]  need Congress to launch an attack in Libya then they agree you know don't get
[01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:26.960]  me wrong I mean you know I'm an equal despiser of both the Democrats and
[01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:31.400]  Republicans but I like to keep people focused on that they shouldn't have just
[01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:34.880]  one or two year memories that these memories need to go back at least a
[01:37:34.880 --> 01:37:39.520]  decade no I agree with you shifting gears into another area when I was
[01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:43.600]  talking to you the other day you said Alex I'm like a honey badger I just
[01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:51.120]  don't care anymore well you know I'll tell you Alex it's my patriotism to this
[01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:58.880]  government is literally shredded I don't have any anymore to the government to the
[01:37:58.880 --> 01:38:02.640]  government that runs this country I have no more patriotism for them and it's a
[01:38:02.640 --> 01:38:08.860]  sad thing to hear hear myself say that what's been taken over but I have no
[01:38:08.860 --> 01:38:14.160]  loyalty to this government of the United States anymore because now to the
[01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:18.480]  people of this country that's different to the country it's like my t-shirt that
[01:38:18.480 --> 01:38:23.360]  I sell now Alex you get it on my website it says I love my country not my
[01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:28.360]  government and it's got Jesse Ventura written right on it I proudly wear that
[01:38:28.360 --> 01:38:34.540]  shirt I love my country not my government and the government is made up of
[01:38:34.540 --> 01:38:44.020]  Democrats and Republicans well gov you let's get into the TSA before we get into
[01:38:44.020 --> 01:38:48.200]  2012 right now you said that you're gonna make a big announcement if the
[01:38:48.200 --> 01:38:54.920]  judge throws out your case without even letting it go to trial I talked to you
[01:38:54.920 --> 01:38:59.360]  last week you said that you were happy to talk but it's just your lawyer and
[01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:04.720]  your opinion but that it looks like the fact that she has waited so long that
[01:39:04.720 --> 01:39:09.280]  your lawyer thinks that might actually lean towards the fact that she's getting
[01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:14.280]  get ready to make sure that it does go to trial well we don't know there's no
[01:39:14.280 --> 01:39:20.160]  way to judge Alex you can when it comes to federal judges throw everything out
[01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:24.320]  the window they're all different you can't you know you have thoughts that well
[01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:29.440]  they're taking a long time so obviously she's studying the case real well well
[01:39:29.440 --> 01:39:33.080]  you'd like to believe that but it might just be maybe she went on vacation and
[01:39:33.080 --> 01:39:39.120]  hasn't got to it I don't know with federal judges you you have no idea all I can
[01:39:39.120 --> 01:39:44.840]  state is this any case like this has been ruled upon faster than this one this
[01:39:44.840 --> 01:39:50.080]  is the longest any judge has held on to a case right now I can state state
[01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:55.040]  that unequivocally because it's been over two months I went in the court I
[01:39:55.040 --> 01:40:00.680]  believe it was July 22 or 21st something like that it was a couple days after my
[01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:05.560]  birthday that's why I had to get back to Minnesota from LA which I had to drive
[01:40:05.560 --> 01:40:11.560]  of course because I can't fly and so I drove back to Minnesota and got back the
[01:40:11.560 --> 01:40:15.720]  night before I had to go in the court and so we went in the court it was like
[01:40:15.720 --> 01:40:21.240]  July 21st or something like that well here we are already past September 21st
[01:40:21.240 --> 01:40:26.720]  and there's no ruling yet so it's been well over 60 days generally rulings
[01:40:26.720 --> 01:40:32.680]  always happen within 90 I'd like to believe mine will also and when she
[01:40:32.680 --> 01:40:36.560]  rules will know but you can't read anything into anything with the federal
[01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:40.480]  judge Alex because they're all different but I just think that it was she
[01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:47.080]  hasn't thrown it out that's the good thing now you're saying you're gonna
[01:40:47.080 --> 01:40:52.600]  make a big announcement if they if it's thrown out I will definitely call a
[01:40:52.600 --> 01:40:59.720]  press conference absolutely if my case is thrown if they will not let me go in
[01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:06.520]  front of a jury and have a trial over my fourth amendment constitutional rights
[01:41:06.520 --> 01:41:14.600]  then I absolutely will have a press conference well I think that's important
[01:41:14.600 --> 01:41:18.520]  to do and then also you said you'd pop in here after the press conference but I
[01:41:18.520 --> 01:41:22.920]  I hope the case goes forward because if it doesn't this I mean this country is
[01:41:22.920 --> 01:41:27.640]  in deep trouble I would think so too I mean you know although I have to tell
[01:41:27.640 --> 01:41:32.120]  you there was a vicious letter to the editor up here in the St. Paul paper
[01:41:32.120 --> 01:41:37.240]  criticizing me for tangling up our court system with such a frivolous stupid
[01:41:37.240 --> 01:41:40.840]  day well Jesse there's a reason nobody reads those rags anymore they had a
[01:41:40.840 --> 01:41:46.880]  USA Today poll last week 85% are against what the TSA is doing and don't
[01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:51.560]  want the NFL under Homeland Security pressure to start having private
[01:41:51.560 --> 01:41:55.680]  security grab your wife's breasts your genitals they say everything will be
[01:41:55.680 --> 01:41:59.760]  groped from the ankles up what's your view of that governor it's already
[01:41:59.760 --> 01:42:05.600]  happening it's already happening Alex I'm a season ticket holder with the
[01:42:05.600 --> 01:42:10.800]  Minnesota link you know the women's basketball team yes and two times in the
[01:42:10.800 --> 01:42:17.400]  last two games I've gone down there they've stopped me to want me and the
[01:42:17.400 --> 01:42:22.520]  first one the guy stopped me because I had my wallet my keys in my front pocket
[01:42:22.520 --> 01:42:27.320]  and he stopped me and said excuse me what's in your front pocket and I looked
[01:42:27.320 --> 01:42:32.800]  at the kid and I said here's a guy said I'm the damn governor I said don't make
[01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:39.560]  me have to sue you like I'm suing TSA I said what difference does it make I
[01:42:39.560 --> 01:42:45.600]  used to be the governor here you know you're some common sense young man I'd
[01:42:45.600 --> 01:42:51.000]  shoot his ass out I showed him I had said it's my wallet my car keys and then I
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:55.520]  got it again the last game well technically I guess they can do it
[01:42:55.520 --> 01:42:58.680]  because they're private industry yeah but now they're saying it's going to be
[01:42:58.680 --> 01:43:02.480]  in shopping malls with TSA governor and to be clear because you may have missed
[01:43:02.480 --> 01:43:07.280]  it all NFL games you're going to actually get the genital grope that you
[01:43:07.280 --> 01:43:12.560]  talk about in your lawsuit that I've witnessed you go under at the and Ron
[01:43:12.560 --> 01:43:17.600]  Paul said it's happened to him at the Atlanta Airport I mean they are saying
[01:43:17.600 --> 01:43:21.400]  now that they're going to grab the breast of your wife everything that's it
[01:43:21.400 --> 01:43:25.520]  I'm not taking my wife and kids to a football game I would like to know how
[01:43:25.520 --> 01:43:29.320]  they expect to get the people in the stands by kickoff no no that's what
[01:43:29.320 --> 01:43:34.080]  they said last week they said add four hours to get in they're saying get there
[01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:39.520]  four hours early now well then when I would just say this if they do that
[01:43:39.520 --> 01:43:43.000]  then I advocate a boycott of the National Football League and leave their
[01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:49.680]  stadiums empty incredible you know that's what this country needs to do to
[01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:55.800]  rise up we the people have to start speaking back and it can be done
[01:43:55.800 --> 01:44:02.200]  simply how about it do the year where nobody flies yes I would love to see
[01:44:02.200 --> 01:44:06.480]  that happen yeah we talked about that but I would be a promoter of it okay
[01:44:06.480 --> 01:44:10.000]  let's then listen we talked about this six months ago we talked about it two
[01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:13.700]  months ago let's pick a date governor right now and let's announce the
[01:44:13.700 --> 01:44:19.200]  national no fly day what really scares them is the opt-out day how about we
[01:44:19.200 --> 01:44:23.440]  have you know national no fly day national opt-out week let's pick a peak
[01:44:23.440 --> 01:44:28.160]  time let's pick Thanksgiving the week of Thanksgiving I know not enough time to
[01:44:28.160 --> 01:44:33.240]  promote it Alex I think that to do something like this you need to go at
[01:44:33.240 --> 01:44:39.560]  least a year and let it build up okay I would tell you how about how about on
[01:44:39.560 --> 01:44:45.160]  our nation's birthday next year the 4th of July okay that's a good day to me
[01:44:45.160 --> 01:44:50.000]  that would be better because that way it gives it time to gain momentum that way
[01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:54.640]  it's like nine months okay let's do it listen but I before I mean it's time for
[01:44:54.640 --> 01:44:59.080]  the people to stand up and tell these people that we're supposed to be a
[01:44:59.080 --> 01:45:05.800]  country of the people by the people and for the people not them you know right
[01:45:05.800 --> 01:45:11.720]  now we're subservient to the government our forefathers did not have that in
[01:45:11.720 --> 01:45:16.200]  mind that isn't what this country was supposed to be the government was supposed
[01:45:16.200 --> 01:45:20.200]  to be subservient to us well governor you always make the point of you'd rather
[01:45:20.200 --> 01:45:24.320]  face the danger I mean you can't stop a killer at a school or a killer at a mall
[01:45:24.320 --> 01:45:28.200]  or tell you something Alex they're putting the people in danger at the
[01:45:28.200 --> 01:45:34.280]  airport will you can I explain why sure all right here's why if when I was in
[01:45:34.280 --> 01:45:39.680]  the team they taught us to think like our opponents the enemy if I were a
[01:45:39.680 --> 01:45:44.160]  suicide bomber do you know where I'd go to blow up the most amount of people I
[01:45:44.160 --> 01:45:49.800]  go to the the check-in line exactly you can walk right in from the outside you
[01:45:49.800 --> 01:45:55.160]  can get in that line there'll be at least 300 people because it's in the whole
[01:45:55.160 --> 01:45:59.760]  floor you wait till you get right in the middle no one's checked you at that
[01:45:59.760 --> 01:46:05.440]  point no one's done anything to you at that point and you're in a crowd of 300
[01:46:05.440 --> 01:46:09.360]  people you then blow yourself up it's what that's for it's like if there's ever
[01:46:09.360 --> 01:46:14.360]  a killing in a cornfield are they gonna say we've got to have random TSA in
[01:46:14.360 --> 01:46:19.280]  cornfields because a rattlesnake killed somebody in one this idea that well not
[01:46:19.280 --> 01:46:25.640]  even a rattlesnake let's say a terrorist get somebody in the cornfield yeah so
[01:46:25.640 --> 01:46:29.480]  now every cornfield in the country has to have TSA yeah and you got to be frisk
[01:46:29.480 --> 01:46:35.160]  before you allowed to go out into the cornfield you know it's about the point
[01:46:35.160 --> 01:46:39.560]  again it begs the bigger question Alex which is this and this is the part of
[01:46:39.560 --> 01:46:44.680]  my court case that begs the bigger question why is it the government's job
[01:46:44.680 --> 01:46:50.440]  to provide security for the airlines when the airlines are private sector
[01:46:50.440 --> 01:46:57.560]  businesses I agree with you well one not have the airlines to provide their own
[01:46:57.560 --> 01:47:04.320]  security that way you as a customer like myself up here it's Delta Delta bought
[01:47:04.320 --> 01:47:10.600]  out northwest 90% if I fly my flights are gonna be Delta I could have a
[01:47:10.600 --> 01:47:15.560]  relationship governor Jesse Ventura with Delta Airlines I could walk out to the
[01:47:15.560 --> 01:47:20.160]  airport show them my passport and they wouldn't have to search me at all
[01:47:20.160 --> 01:47:24.120]  because they as a private sector business with no cheat
[01:47:24.120 --> 01:47:29.840]  Jesse Ventura has been flying for 30 years exactly Ventura poses no threat
[01:47:29.840 --> 01:47:33.520]  putting on the plane well it's about being guilty until proven innocent it's
[01:47:33.520 --> 01:47:36.720]  this idea that we're gonna put our hands on you we're gonna take blood at
[01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:39.920]  checkpoints without warrants under federal grants we're gonna have the
[01:47:39.920 --> 01:47:44.680]  federal government everywhere Alex I'll tell you what I see next here's what I
[01:47:44.680 --> 01:47:49.960]  see next they're going to use illegal immigration to get us issue
[01:47:49.960 --> 01:47:54.320]  national ID cards I agree Ron Paul's talked about that yeah and then what's
[01:47:54.320 --> 01:47:58.720]  gonna happen each state is gonna say well we don't want these illegal
[01:47:58.720 --> 01:48:03.920]  immigrants in our state so we're gonna have checkpoints on all the highways
[01:48:03.920 --> 01:48:08.680]  that lead on into our state where you're gonna have to show your national ID in
[01:48:08.680 --> 01:48:12.880]  which to come into our state no I agree it's dangerous which totally totally
[01:48:12.880 --> 01:48:19.440]  violates the Constitution and if we the people get sucked in on this one and if
[01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:24.640]  people sit back and say oh yeah keep me safe I mean aren't they listening to
[01:48:24.640 --> 01:48:29.740]  Ben Franklin when Ben Franklin said the famous quote those that give up
[01:48:29.740 --> 01:48:34.800]  liberty for security shall have and deserve neither well governor look at
[01:48:34.800 --> 01:48:38.320]  Mexico they've got checkpoints down there and they've got 40,000 dead in the
[01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:46.120]  last three years checkpoints checkpoints do not keep you safe no
[01:48:46.120 --> 01:48:51.720]  because what do you think the criminals gonna go through the checkpoint no I
[01:48:51.720 --> 01:48:56.000]  mean it's so stupid well the drug cartels just attack the checkpoints now
[01:48:56.000 --> 01:49:00.120]  we're running out it's like Alex at the airport you took it on the tarmac all
[01:49:00.120 --> 01:49:05.600]  you got to do is have a slide to card you're like a credit card you just slide
[01:49:05.600 --> 01:49:09.160]  it through a thing and you're out on the tarmac well listen I certainly don't
[01:49:09.160 --> 01:49:12.120]  have the money for a private jet but I've got friends who've got private jets
[01:49:12.120 --> 01:49:16.880]  and Charlie she's come to town to pick me up before and you just pull right up
[01:49:16.880 --> 01:49:23.120]  and walk right through no security and I'm on the tarmac yeah exactly it's a
[01:49:23.120 --> 01:49:27.440]  fraud it is a total fraud now listen thing is a total fraud people better
[01:49:27.440 --> 01:49:32.120]  start waking up to it and stop sitting out the thing oh keep me safe protect me
[01:49:32.120 --> 01:49:37.160]  at the airport Wow Jesse so much good info we've talked about so much common
[01:49:37.160 --> 01:49:41.280]  sense what about Ron Paul you know I asked you on the phone I said governor
[01:49:41.280 --> 01:49:45.000]  you're gonna run for president tell folks what you said well first of all if
[01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:49.600]  Ron Paul would quit the damn Republican Party and run as a libertarian
[01:49:49.600 --> 01:49:55.800]  that's what he is he's not a Republican he's a libertarian the libertarians
[01:49:55.800 --> 01:50:01.080]  have ballot access in all 50 states Ron Paul could be the libertarians
[01:50:01.080 --> 01:50:07.640]  candidates for president that's what needs to happen you know let's elect the
[01:50:07.640 --> 01:50:13.280]  president that isn't a Democrat or Republican then Ron Paul takes me as his
[01:50:13.280 --> 01:50:19.520]  running mate why because I'm the best insurance policy he could ever have
[01:50:19.520 --> 01:50:27.000]  there ain't nobody gonna kill Ron Paul and let Jesse Ventura in there that's a
[01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:30.920]  good point when you made that well Jesse listen you know I talked to Ron Paul
[01:50:30.920 --> 01:50:34.080]  privately the last time he ran in this time and I he said I don't know if I'm
[01:50:34.080 --> 01:50:37.880]  gonna run Alex and I said look you're as smart as I am or smarter congressman
[01:50:37.880 --> 01:50:43.040]  you're gonna win by injecting real issues anti-war all the rest of this
[01:50:43.040 --> 01:50:47.640]  stuff pro-constitution you got a run he said no you that's he and he said no
[01:50:47.640 --> 01:50:53.480]  that's a good point I probably am I am telling Ron Paul here on air and I'm
[01:50:53.480 --> 01:51:00.480]  saying it to to Ron Paul listeners and supporters to let him know this and I
[01:51:00.480 --> 01:51:03.880]  know it's already been run pasting he has said he'll only run using the
[01:51:03.880 --> 01:51:09.200]  Republican machinery because he has a real shot at winning but if he doesn't
[01:51:09.200 --> 01:51:14.680]  win the Republican primary if he runs as the libertarian candidate he will get
[01:51:14.680 --> 01:51:18.920]  the nomination he'll get a strong showing he could get double digits and be in
[01:51:18.920 --> 01:51:22.240]  the pole position like Ross Perot was before Bush threatened him and he dropped
[01:51:22.240 --> 01:51:27.440]  down and Ron Paul does have a chance to win and you could join the ticket or you
[01:51:27.440 --> 01:51:31.400]  could be part of the cabinet if he offered it but regardless then he'd be
[01:51:31.400 --> 01:51:36.880]  in the main main election challenging Obama and Mitt Romney or whoever else is
[01:51:36.880 --> 01:51:41.080]  there Ron I'm drafting Ron Paul he must run as a libertarian if he loses the
[01:51:41.080 --> 01:51:45.840]  Republican primary I agree I agree wholeheartedly with that and I'm telling
[01:51:45.840 --> 01:51:51.080]  you if Ron Paul took me as a running mate we wouldn't just do well Alex we
[01:51:51.080 --> 01:51:56.800]  could win I know people love you that right for me because I never enter
[01:51:56.800 --> 01:52:03.000]  races with the thought of just doing well Jesse Ventura doesn't do things just
[01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:10.160]  to do them well Jesse Ventura does things to win to be the best I didn't
[01:52:10.160 --> 01:52:15.480]  join the underwater demolition seal team the most elite unit the US military
[01:52:15.480 --> 01:52:20.040]  just to do something well I understand I did it because I'd like being the best
[01:52:20.040 --> 01:52:25.560]  but my point Ron Paul can win it's out there yeah all you've got to do is
[01:52:25.560 --> 01:52:33.120]  activate and get the silent voters out to vote yeah that that 30 40 50% that
[01:52:33.120 --> 01:52:38.960]  calls themselves independent sitting out there on the 50% that don't vote yes
[01:52:38.960 --> 01:52:43.760]  you have to give them a reason to see their vote work it would create
[01:52:43.760 --> 01:52:48.000]  incredible excitement it would create unbelievable excitement if Ron Paul and
[01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:53.520]  Iran is the libertarian ticket well Ron Paul's a great guy he's got a lot of
[01:52:53.520 --> 01:52:57.920]  great people around him he also has some mainline kind of Republican people who
[01:52:57.920 --> 01:53:04.200]  but so you're reaching out to Ron Paul right now no I'm just saying I would be
[01:53:04.200 --> 01:53:08.960]  his best choice because I'd be a great insurance policy Alex yes sir we're not
[01:53:08.960 --> 01:53:14.040]  going to do anything to him and that would put me in charge they're far
[01:53:14.040 --> 01:53:18.840]  better off with Ron Paul than they are Jesse Ventura as far as somebody who
[01:53:18.840 --> 01:53:25.280]  you know would cause the major problems well just incredible information gov but
[01:53:25.280 --> 01:53:29.880]  I want to be clear where I stand from I don't do this radio show because I think
[01:53:29.880 --> 01:53:33.400]  we'll do well I know we're going to beat tyranny we don't have a choice I was
[01:53:33.400 --> 01:53:39.280]  just being clear that bike but by competing by being involved by going
[01:53:39.280 --> 01:53:42.520]  all the way and staying in the election all the way through even as an
[01:53:42.520 --> 01:53:47.600]  independent you win just by being involved in injecting real ideas you know
[01:53:47.600 --> 01:53:51.720]  you have to use a sports analogy you go to the playoffs sure he can win the
[01:53:51.720 --> 01:53:56.600]  Super Bowl as well obviously play to win I'm just saying you win by competing
[01:53:56.600 --> 01:54:00.760]  you never win if you don't really and maybe what you do Alex if you don't win
[01:54:00.760 --> 01:54:05.520]  this time you lay the groundwork for the next guy to win exactly no no I
[01:54:05.520 --> 01:54:10.040]  understand that it's a process that takes a while I could never been governor
[01:54:10.040 --> 01:54:16.560]  of Minnesota without the runs that Dean Barkley did before me because Dean
[01:54:16.560 --> 01:54:20.800]  Barkley was the man that got my party major party status in the state of
[01:54:20.800 --> 01:54:26.520]  Minnesota yes and it took Dean Barkley to do that first before I ever would have
[01:54:26.520 --> 01:54:31.120]  had if Dean hadn't done that there's no way that I would have won governor
[01:54:31.120 --> 01:54:34.560]  because I wouldn't have had major party status and I wouldn't have been
[01:54:34.560 --> 01:54:39.360]  included in the debates exactly there are trailblazers that come before us and
[01:54:39.360 --> 01:54:45.040]  then each of us is a trailblazer for the next precisely precisely so that's what
[01:54:45.040 --> 01:54:49.880]  needs to happen Ron Paul needs to quit the Republican Party get the nomination
[01:54:49.880 --> 01:54:55.720]  of the Libertarian Party but he's got to we can't be the it has to be the
[01:54:55.720 --> 01:55:02.560]  Libertarian small L well I did hear a little bird that that may be why in fact
[01:55:02.560 --> 01:55:06.320]  there's no maybe about it he is probably I'm not gonna say anything Ron Paul is
[01:55:06.320 --> 01:55:10.480]  looking at what you're saying I know that okay well I hope so I really hope so
[01:55:10.480 --> 01:55:15.640]  because Ron has the power and I think if the two of us and I guarantee you that
[01:55:15.640 --> 01:55:20.240]  as I walk around today you can't believe all the people that come up to me and
[01:55:20.240 --> 01:55:23.480]  asked me to run for president well I want to talk more about that but let me
[01:55:23.480 --> 01:55:27.400]  just get tell you Ron Paul's announced he's not running again for the house so
[01:55:27.400 --> 01:55:33.200]  he'll be out in a year regardless and the word is he is positioning to say when
[01:55:33.200 --> 01:55:37.480]  he quits the Republican Party that hey I'm serving out my term I'm done I'm
[01:55:37.480 --> 01:55:40.400]  leaving the party and then he'd have to do that because he probably couldn't
[01:55:40.400 --> 01:55:44.000]  win that house seat later without the Republican engine and that and that it
[01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:48.160]  is positioning for that so I know Paul's looking at it we need to make sure he
[01:55:48.160 --> 01:55:53.000]  knows he doesn't have a choice destiny and history has drafted him and as you
[01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:56.640]  said governor a lot of people look I know you personally I know you behind the
[01:55:56.640 --> 01:56:00.720]  scenes you are the real McCoy that's why I admire you you are a real person you
[01:56:00.720 --> 01:56:04.120]  believe in what you believe in and that's the end of it you're not some
[01:56:04.120 --> 01:56:09.200]  puppet on a string neither is Ron Paul and Dennis Kucinich is a great guy but
[01:56:09.200 --> 01:56:13.640]  he's not as libertarian as you guys are and he said he might put Kucinich in his
[01:56:13.640 --> 01:56:18.640]  cabinet would you look at being in a Ron Paul cabinet if he won I don't know you
[01:56:18.640 --> 01:56:27.240]  know it would depend on could I leave the Baha in fact Alex if I if I was his
[01:56:27.240 --> 01:56:33.800]  VP guy could we move the VP down to the Baha because I mean the president VP
[01:56:33.800 --> 01:56:39.800]  can't be together anyway right no you exactly so I'll go down to the Baha then
[01:56:39.800 --> 01:56:43.800]  as long as I can keep out of my Baha winters are surfing we got no problem
[01:56:43.800 --> 01:56:47.760]  well I you know I've heard a lot of presidents want their like George
[01:56:47.760 --> 01:56:51.320]  Washington had John Adams they want their what they want their vice president
[01:56:51.320 --> 01:56:55.520]  to a stay out of it well and I would I'd be happy to stay out of it you know I
[01:56:55.520 --> 01:56:58.760]  just be there waiting in the wings to make sure nothing would happen to him
[01:56:58.760 --> 01:57:02.520]  okay so officially you're saying you would take a VP spot with Ron Paul I
[01:57:02.520 --> 01:57:06.440]  would give it very serious consideration I can't tell you right now I would
[01:57:06.440 --> 01:57:11.680]  because my wife is not sitting next to me what's a Terry no anything I would do
[01:57:11.680 --> 01:57:16.560]  of that nature I would require to have to talk to her first because we've been
[01:57:16.560 --> 01:57:21.320]  married 36 years now and I don't do much of anything without consulting there
[01:57:21.320 --> 01:57:26.200]  sure sure but if you're other how I but if you're a better half said green light
[01:57:26.200 --> 01:57:33.920]  then you're your go wow that is that is breaking news governor I guarantee you
[01:57:33.920 --> 01:57:37.360]  this is gonna end up being in the news today well amazing we've only got about
[01:57:37.360 --> 01:57:41.240]  a minute and a half left I hope folks get the books briefly tell us about when
[01:57:41.240 --> 01:57:45.400]  the TV shows coming back and about new books in the wings well it did deny
[01:57:45.400 --> 01:57:49.160]  working on another book that hopefully you'll be out right before the elections
[01:57:49.160 --> 01:57:55.160]  because it'll be a timely book dealing with the elections and the TV show in
[01:57:55.160 --> 01:57:59.000]  the middle of production as I said right now unfortunately we have this
[01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:03.920]  tragedy happened a couple days ago which we're looking into a course and we will
[01:58:03.920 --> 01:58:08.680]  probably cover it with the TV show because it was part of it and when we
[01:58:08.680 --> 01:58:13.240]  go on the air I'm not really sure I'm estimating that will be I'm I'm
[01:58:13.240 --> 01:58:17.800]  officially to be done by December the first part of December the very first
[01:58:17.800 --> 01:58:23.120]  couple days of December and so I would figure editing I just with a ballpark
[01:58:23.120 --> 01:58:26.840]  yes I would say the eight episodes will probably start in January but don't
[01:58:26.840 --> 01:58:32.440]  quote me because I that's the networks call not mind and they could start them
[01:58:32.440 --> 01:58:36.520]  sooner they could start them later I'm not privy to that information but there
[01:58:36.520 --> 01:58:40.400]  will be eight more show very exciting governor we're out of time okay thanks

[02:00:01.120 --> 02:00:12.400]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[02:00:12.400 --> 02:00:19.960]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[02:00:19.960 --> 02:00:33.040]  Texas Alex Jones Wow while Jesse was talking there's so much important stuff
[02:00:33.040 --> 02:00:37.560]  he talked about would support a national boycott of the NFL you write all this
[02:00:37.560 --> 02:00:43.800]  down that's that's Newsmaker NFL if it continues if they do the groping he's
[02:00:43.800 --> 02:00:53.400]  gonna boycott him calls for a boycott he also of course said he thinks it's
[02:00:53.400 --> 02:00:59.640]  suspicious with the SEALs suspicious with the SEALs of course the biggest news
[02:00:59.640 --> 02:01:04.040]  there I'm multitasking here I'm about to give my writers articles to write about
[02:01:04.040 --> 02:01:12.480]  that big interview you just heard NFL suspicious of the SEALs deaths of course
[02:01:12.480 --> 02:01:19.320]  the big one would run as the VP with Ron Paul and challenges Ron Paul to quit
[02:01:19.320 --> 02:01:25.880]  the Republican Party we need to get Ron Paul obviously he can't commit publicly
[02:01:25.880 --> 02:01:28.680]  to this right now or they'll say you're not even really a Republican get out of
[02:01:28.680 --> 02:01:35.320]  here but if he doesn't win that nomination in the next four months or so
[02:01:35.320 --> 02:01:38.280]  because that's what we'll know in the caucuses about four months from now we'll
[02:01:38.280 --> 02:01:43.560]  really have a clear image and then he can turn campaign for liberty on in all
[02:01:43.560 --> 02:01:48.360]  50 states and he will absolutely have a much bigger organization than Ross Perot
[02:01:48.360 --> 02:01:52.160]  and has a good chance of winning then he'll get the death threats though and
[02:01:52.160 --> 02:01:55.680]  the question is what will he do when that happens Ross Perot they called it
[02:01:55.680 --> 02:01:58.800]  Ross Perot so we're gonna kill your family that was on the news he was
[02:01:58.800 --> 02:02:03.660]  wondering why Ross Perot quit he said my family was threatened and I lived in
[02:02:03.660 --> 02:02:07.000]  Dallas then it came out in Dallas they said we're gonna kill you and kill your
[02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:12.360]  wife and kids but when that happens you just come out and then it was like well
[02:02:12.360 --> 02:02:18.080]  he's so crazy for saying that of course they said that of course they did when he
[02:02:18.080 --> 02:02:23.040]  had 30-something percentage of the vote in a three-way race as soon as he got
[02:02:23.040 --> 02:02:29.800]  even with Bush and Clinton man it was over Wow that was a big interview right
[02:02:29.800 --> 02:02:35.160]  there okay here's the deal I got economy politics world news we got info

[02:03:04.160 --> 02:03:07.760]  the greatest part about doing this radio show is fighting corruption and
[02:03:07.760 --> 02:03:11.760]  standing up for goodness and and resonating with so many good men and
[02:03:11.760 --> 02:03:15.120]  men and women who have spirits that love liberty and goodness around the world
[02:03:15.120 --> 02:03:23.520]  and getting to know people like Jesse Ventura Ron Paul Dave Mustaine Willie
[02:03:23.520 --> 02:03:28.960]  Nelson and the list goes on and on Charlie Sheen has his problems but he's a
[02:03:28.960 --> 02:03:33.960]  real guy a great guy the problem is though about 90% of the famous people I

[02:08:28.240 --> 02:08:32.560]  final hour today but we won't be done then I'll be back tonight 7 o'clock in
[02:08:32.560 --> 02:08:39.200]  full wars nightly news we have a big blind spot on this show that I've warned
[02:08:39.200 --> 02:08:46.360]  everybody about that I try to stay conscious of and it's this I don't have
[02:08:46.360 --> 02:08:53.440]  follow-through in one key area that I should I have doggedness I'm badger like
[02:08:53.440 --> 02:09:01.160]  I keep on coming I'm hard-headed that's the main attribute for Liberty I know
[02:09:01.160 --> 02:09:04.600]  you as Americans and many others around the world you know also cherish that
[02:09:04.600 --> 02:09:11.520]  attribute but I have a tendency not to toot our horn I have a bad tendency not
[02:09:11.520 --> 02:09:16.280]  to toot our horn and it's important to do that that's why a few weeks ago I
[02:09:16.280 --> 02:09:20.720]  launched a contest and never really gave a date on it I've got to go see what
[02:09:20.720 --> 02:09:24.640]  entries have come in I know a bunch are coming in for clipping together clips of
[02:09:24.640 --> 02:09:28.400]  the show the last few years of our predictions coming true and first place
[02:09:28.400 --> 02:09:34.480]  is $3,000 second place 1500 third place 500 because nothing wakes people up I've
[02:09:34.480 --> 02:09:40.800]  seen like us laying it out and then it coming out mainstream news later again
[02:09:40.800 --> 02:09:44.880]  it's not hey I go all over the country and people know who I am now and support
[02:09:44.880 --> 02:09:48.280]  us that's not who look I'm a big shot it's actually really gives up your
[02:09:48.280 --> 02:09:52.800]  privacy it's hey people are waking up this this show is popular that's an
[02:09:52.800 --> 02:10:01.320]  illustration of that well it's the same thing when it comes to pointing out that
[02:10:01.320 --> 02:10:07.280]  see we told you so and that goes for you the listeners as well how many of you
[02:10:07.280 --> 02:10:12.080]  told your wife your husband your neighbor your boss your employees your
[02:10:12.080 --> 02:10:18.120]  grandmother your son your daughter whoever it is your pastor or as a pastor
[02:10:18.120 --> 02:10:21.660]  you told your flock you told them what was coming you told them what was
[02:10:21.660 --> 02:10:26.960]  happening they laughed at you and now all this stuff has come true it's all
[02:10:26.960 --> 02:10:31.380]  happened and then some exactly as we said it would because we were reading
[02:10:31.380 --> 02:10:34.760]  globalist documents we were just going off what they said they would do is
[02:10:34.760 --> 02:10:40.960]  global engineers global social and economic engineers for this world
[02:10:40.960 --> 02:10:49.600]  government system now it our credibility has gone way up liberty and freedom and
[02:10:49.600 --> 02:10:53.960]  understanding the global corporate crony system is very popular I see it on
[02:10:53.960 --> 02:10:59.320]  CNN Fox Rush Limbaugh Glenn Beck everywhere now I tune into random radio
[02:10:59.320 --> 02:11:04.280]  shows liberal conservatives rock and roll shows they're talking about the
[02:11:04.280 --> 02:11:08.920]  crony capitalist and the insider fat cats having one set of rules for us another
[02:11:08.920 --> 02:11:16.040]  set of rules for them people are really getting it and now it's important to go
[02:11:16.040 --> 02:11:20.840]  hey Ron Paul talked about this stuff 20 years ago Alex Jones talked about this
[02:11:20.840 --> 02:11:24.960]  stuff 16 years ago G. Edward Griffin talked about this 45 years ago Bob
[02:11:24.960 --> 02:11:28.880]  Chapman 50 years ago hey if you've seen this book have you seen this video
[02:11:28.880 --> 02:11:38.600]  because it's all that old stuff now that is the most important now I got
[02:11:38.600 --> 02:11:45.200]  callers listening on XM on the Roku box on AM and FM affiliates we're gonna get
[02:11:45.200 --> 02:11:49.120]  to Madison Peter Scott Bill Norm and others here in just a moment but I've
[02:11:49.120 --> 02:11:56.360]  got to go over this because because the establishment bleeding out in
[02:11:56.360 --> 02:12:03.120]  crusted disease discredited joke media is very dangerous right now they are
[02:12:03.120 --> 02:12:08.120]  flailing around and in their death rows and can take us down with them right
[02:12:08.120 --> 02:12:12.480]  now we have got to sit back when they call us names and laugh at us and go
[02:12:12.480 --> 02:12:21.840]  you're doing that as a confidence game you're pathetic you're falling apart and
[02:12:21.840 --> 02:12:27.120]  call them on their scams and be more bold now than ever a lot of us have kind
[02:12:27.120 --> 02:12:31.840]  of started resting like okay people are finally listening oh no this is not the
[02:12:31.840 --> 02:12:35.200]  time to do that this is the time to come out and stop being apologetic to your
[02:12:35.200 --> 02:12:38.640]  neighbors well I know it sounds cookie but there's a global government it's
[02:12:38.640 --> 02:12:44.280]  not cookie that elites want total power that's history it's now time to say hey
[02:12:44.280 --> 02:12:49.160]  we told you so look it came true we warned you and there's not time to screw
[02:12:49.160 --> 02:12:55.880]  around we told you the house was on fire when the grease pan exploded and there
[02:12:55.880 --> 02:13:00.800]  was just some smoke in the kitchen we tried to put it out now it's spread into
[02:13:00.800 --> 02:13:04.080]  the dining room the living room the bedroom there's flames coming out the
[02:13:04.080 --> 02:13:07.720]  windows you're not going to save this thing you got to get out of it and try
[02:13:07.720 --> 02:13:11.160]  to rebuild it now there's fire shooting out everywhere we're like we told you
[02:13:11.160 --> 02:13:14.560]  there's fire and they're still going are you sure that orange stuff that's hot
[02:13:14.560 --> 02:13:22.320]  and that smoke is tearing I'm not sure and you're like well just forget these
[02:13:22.320 --> 02:13:25.640]  people that don't care don't want to listen we can't do that they're
[02:13:25.640 --> 02:13:28.960]  lemmings that'll run us off the cliff with them but the globalists are going
[02:13:28.960 --> 02:13:35.880]  to be able to misdirect if we don't reach out to them now it's just that
[02:13:35.880 --> 02:13:44.760]  simple and for all of you that serve the system as as what we've talked about
[02:13:44.760 --> 02:13:48.520]  becomes self-evident and and as it's proven that we were right and that we
[02:13:48.520 --> 02:13:51.640]  were willing to be criticized in the face of all your propaganda and
[02:13:51.640 --> 02:13:56.760]  demonization including law enforcement harassment as it becomes evident that
[02:13:56.760 --> 02:14:00.560]  we're right a lot of you aren't waking up and joining liberty you're deciding to
[02:14:00.560 --> 02:14:08.040]  further dig in and make excuses and go along with corruption do you like where
[02:14:08.040 --> 02:14:11.480]  corruption is taking us the country falling apart the world falling apart
[02:14:11.480 --> 02:14:18.080]  crime exploding insecure future I mean do you like that do you like the wages of

[02:15:16.640 --> 02:15:22.040]  giving in to it giving in to being a man giving in to being a woman giving in
[02:15:22.040 --> 02:15:28.000]  to who you already were you have to have cowardice and fear super imposed on you

[02:16:41.800 --> 02:16:46.120]  rant then I'm going to your calls what made me go on this rant I saw this
[02:16:46.120 --> 02:16:49.680]  yesterday I covered it on the nightly news and then I didn't even cover it
[02:16:49.680 --> 02:16:55.160]  today in two hours AP Reuters Fox News they all covered it here's Fox News
[02:16:55.160 --> 02:16:58.680]  Fox Nation this didn't go on the main Fox site it went on their little tea
[02:16:58.680 --> 02:17:04.680]  party site their little M4s ripoff taxpayers paid for fast and furious and
[02:17:04.680 --> 02:17:09.880]  it tells us what we already knew from federal filings and in Arizona and
[02:17:09.880 --> 02:17:17.480]  Illinois that the government actually sold the guns in one case two thousand
[02:17:17.480 --> 02:17:21.560]  of them to send a low a drug cartel now last not on the show I showed you the
[02:17:21.560 --> 02:17:26.240]  El Paso times UPI and others where it was known months ago and of course we
[02:17:26.240 --> 02:17:31.080]  knew even before that from the filings prison planet did break this just from
[02:17:31.080 --> 02:17:36.360]  the federal filings listeners broke it they found it in Senate to us listeners
[02:17:36.360 --> 02:17:40.720]  broke it but we we broke it the media again showing how you are the power
[02:17:40.720 --> 02:17:43.600]  people always ask why aren't you covering this because I didn't know till
[02:17:43.600 --> 02:17:48.360]  you told me also get emails and comments why I'm not covering the Wall Street
[02:17:48.360 --> 02:17:51.480]  thing I've covered it every day for a week and a half with guests on many
[02:17:51.480 --> 02:17:55.800]  times and it's still going on the arrestor still going on and it's it's
[02:17:55.800 --> 02:18:00.080]  folks it's great what they're doing they're protesting now
[02:18:00.080 --> 02:18:09.280]  what Fox doesn't tell you you think Fox would want to bring down Obama no it's
[02:18:09.280 --> 02:18:15.160]  all about a balance of power in the elite is that Sena Loa also confirmed in
[02:18:15.160 --> 02:18:18.720]  federal court and the feds admitted it is allowed to ship in for five years
[02:18:18.720 --> 02:18:25.160]  hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of tons of tons of pure cocaine through
[02:18:25.160 --> 02:18:33.200]  Texas New Mexico Arizona and California. Sena Loa is on the border and teamed up
[02:18:33.200 --> 02:18:38.000]  with the bankers and is fighting a war with other cartels that are bringing the
[02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:41.720]  drugs up and have to go through Sena Loa territory and the our government which
[02:18:41.720 --> 02:18:45.240]  is the big foreign banks the criminals are laundering that money publicly and
[02:18:45.240 --> 02:18:49.760]  having the ATF ship guns to Sena Loa to try to win their war against the other
[02:18:49.760 --> 02:18:53.240]  cartels that aren't laundering their money through Wacova Wells Fargo and
[02:18:53.240 --> 02:18:56.280]  others who've all been caught on record hundreds of billions in laundered
[02:18:56.280 --> 02:19:03.560]  money if your new listeners just Google that you can read it said 376 billion in
[02:19:03.560 --> 02:19:08.040]  two years alone two and a half years that's Bloomberg AP Reuters as well so
[02:19:08.040 --> 02:19:12.560]  you're not getting the rest of the story as Paul Hardy would say and that is the
[02:19:12.560 --> 02:19:21.040]  rest of the story good day Paul Harvey well the rest of the story good day
[02:19:21.040 --> 02:19:28.360]  I have to hear him at the imitation right is that they're not just allowing
[02:19:28.360 --> 02:19:32.320]  the guns to be shipped in and actually having taxpayer money pay for it in one
[02:19:32.320 --> 02:19:37.120]  office the ATF it said we're almost in fist fights with agents saying I'm not
[02:19:37.120 --> 02:19:39.520]  gonna be part of this and saying we've been ordered by the White House to do
[02:19:39.520 --> 02:19:43.600]  this and the White House has perjured themselves so my point is we need to come
[02:19:43.600 --> 02:19:47.800]  out and to our horn here that we were right about this we told you about this
[02:19:47.800 --> 02:19:53.320]  eight nine months ago with precision and now it's come out and the Republicans
[02:19:53.320 --> 02:19:59.080]  aren't even making this a campaign issue to destroy Barack the criminal Obama we
[02:19:59.080 --> 02:20:05.200]  need to use this issue Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our

[02:25:28.280 --> 02:25:33.000]  front. I'll get to Scott in a minute. I want to talk to somebody. Listen on a Roku box though.
[02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:37.000]  Everything's moving to that. It's like your internet on your TV. That's how my wife watches TV
[02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:42.920]  now. We're going to just stomp the enemy in that format. It's a level playing field. Bye-bye.
[02:25:42.920 --> 02:25:48.600]  Dinosaur media. Look what we do on the web. Total domination. Glenn Beck, everybody would dominate
[02:25:48.600 --> 02:25:56.120]  them. Let's go ahead and talk to Norm in Nevada on XM 166. That wasn't another XM channel. I can't
[02:25:56.120 --> 02:26:01.320]  keep track of it. Welcome, Norm. Alex, how you doing today? Good. Thanks for holding brother.
[02:26:01.320 --> 02:26:08.680]  What's on your mind? Hey big daddy. I was listening to you and Jesse and I have a comment. I think
[02:26:08.680 --> 02:26:14.200]  you guys are right. I think we need to boycott the NFL. We need to boycott flying. Set a date for
[02:26:14.200 --> 02:26:20.600]  that. Definitely like July 4th. That was really good the next year. The other thing is to back to
[02:26:20.600 --> 02:26:26.440]  the SEALs. I just have a quick comment on that and what you take on this. After the SEALs went down,
[02:26:26.440 --> 02:26:32.760]  evidently on their bin Laden raid, about I want to say three or four weeks after that or two to
[02:26:32.760 --> 02:26:40.200]  three weeks after that, they had a bunch of SEALs go down in Afghanistan. No, I mean I've talked to
[02:26:40.200 --> 02:26:47.080]  the father of a Navy SEAL whom I, I'm not going to get into it. We've known a long time. I'll just
[02:26:47.080 --> 02:26:52.920]  leave it at that. And his son is in, I think he said SEAL team three, but he has a friend, best
[02:26:52.920 --> 02:26:58.280]  buddy in six who said that they, they said standard operating procedure wasn't followed.
[02:26:58.280 --> 02:27:03.320]  It was the whole thing on multiple fronts and that they believe it was a setup. And then he was
[02:27:03.320 --> 02:27:08.600]  like, yeah, they think Al Qaeda like somehow has got a mole and ordered him and put a bomb on him.
[02:27:08.600 --> 02:27:12.440]  Like Al Qaeda's got a mole. Yeah, right. The point is they just can't bring themselves to
[02:27:12.440 --> 02:27:15.800]  understand the government did it. But yes, the SEALs think there was foul play.
[02:27:17.480 --> 02:27:21.800]  Yeah, my other point was that on that other chopper that went down in Afghanistan,
[02:27:21.800 --> 02:27:28.200]  it was more of a cover up in the bin Laden thing, but they really didn't give names or nothing like
[02:27:28.200 --> 02:27:33.960]  that or anything to anybody about who went down, you know, what their, you know, status was and
[02:27:33.960 --> 02:27:38.120]  all that. That's what I initially thought was we knew some SEALs got killed in the helicopter
[02:27:38.120 --> 02:27:42.200]  that blew up in the fake bin Laden raid. So I was thinking that might have been it,
[02:27:42.200 --> 02:27:47.400]  but then I talked to my sources and they said, no, it was the rest of SEAL team six that was
[02:27:47.400 --> 02:27:53.080]  complaining and stuff and they blew them up. So I mean, you know, I mean, this is directly from
[02:27:54.280 --> 02:28:00.040]  the father of a Navy SEAL and my, I have, I'm just going to say the family knows the Navy SEAL
[02:28:00.040 --> 02:28:05.080]  as well. In fact, I'm going to just shut up there because my family doesn't like me talking about
[02:28:05.080 --> 02:28:11.160]  them. But anything else, sir? Well, it would not be great if Jesse runs with Paul.
[02:28:12.600 --> 02:28:16.120]  Yeah. I mean, that's a really good team. I mean, there's going to be some issues
[02:28:16.120 --> 02:28:20.840]  because Jesse's kind of liberal on a few things, but he's being educated. Jesse's really smart
[02:28:20.840 --> 02:28:26.680]  and a great guy. He wouldn't believe the things I've convinced him of and shown to him. So he's
[02:28:26.680 --> 02:28:31.880]  just gets better by the day. He's really waking up and, you know, he's, he's going through this
[02:28:31.880 --> 02:28:36.520]  metamorphosis of having to look at all this information. I appreciate your call. Good to
[02:28:36.520 --> 02:28:42.440]  hear from you. Let's talk to a Roku box listener, Madison in Wisconsin. There's a Madison in
[02:28:42.440 --> 02:28:48.920]  Wisconsin as well. Go ahead. Yeah. Hi, Alex. I just wanted to be as concise as possible.
[02:28:49.720 --> 02:28:57.000]  I sent out just today $500 for one check and $200 for another check to go to
[02:28:57.000 --> 02:29:03.560]  the very nice gals in your business office. I had spoken with them in the past and I'm going to
[02:29:03.560 --> 02:29:11.640]  let's see, 500 bucks. So get me about 84 memberships times six. That's about 504 people I can turn on.
[02:29:11.640 --> 02:29:17.880]  The other $200 I'm going to send out to some listeners or potential listeners in other
[02:29:18.440 --> 02:29:22.760]  Let me say this and I'm going to hold you over, Madison, to finish up the checks in the mail,
[02:29:22.760 --> 02:29:28.440]  by the way. We do get donations. We do get people buying bulk videos, books. This is a big machine
[02:29:28.440 --> 02:29:36.680]  now. For me, it's big 35 employees or so, some contractors, equipment, bandwidth. It's costing us
[02:29:38.120 --> 02:29:45.800]  $4 million a year to operate $4 million a year. We're a big operation now. People ask me sometimes,
[02:29:45.800 --> 02:29:49.000]  is this your day job? Yeah, it's my day job. Stay there.
[02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:57.240]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[02:30:19.960 --> 02:30:24.920]  The crazy part is he's usually right. You see, he predicted the collapse of GM,
[02:30:24.920 --> 02:30:29.560]  Panny Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, general growth properties. In fact,
[02:30:29.560 --> 02:30:34.120]  Barron's called his work a dire prophecy. Recently, he created a video which you can
[02:30:34.120 --> 02:30:38.760]  watch online for free detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet. And it's a real
[02:30:38.760 --> 02:30:43.560]  eye opener. I can't stress this enough. You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:30:43.560 --> 02:30:47.800]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:30:47.800 --> 02:30:54.440]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com. That's End of America, the number three.

[02:31:00.840 --> 02:31:05.400]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar powered generator.
[02:31:05.400 --> 02:31:09.720]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:31:09.720 --> 02:31:14.760]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[02:31:14.760 --> 02:31:20.360]  to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[02:31:20.360 --> 02:31:25.480]  is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:31:25.480 --> 02:31:30.760]  And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous
[02:31:30.760 --> 02:31:35.240]  weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power
[02:31:35.240 --> 02:31:40.040]  from weather related onages. Number five, a solar powered generator provides powerful backup
[02:31:40.040 --> 02:31:44.040]  insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar powered generators offered by
[02:31:44.040 --> 02:31:50.760]  Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[02:32:04.360 --> 02:32:10.120]  Folks, we're all fighting huge food price increases. E-Foods Direct has been doing all we can this
[02:32:10.120 --> 02:32:16.760]  year to help you get food before the perfect storm of exploding food prices from the 2011 harvest.
[02:32:16.760 --> 02:32:22.120]  During September, E-Foods is giving you free shipping on your food supply orders. But you have
[02:32:22.120 --> 02:32:28.120]  to understand we're entering the eye of the food cost storm. Ethanol is boosting gas prices and
[02:32:28.120 --> 02:32:34.600]  driving corn costs so high our wheat for bread is going into animal feed and pasta wheat cost has
[02:32:34.600 --> 02:32:39.560]  doubled since last year. I strongly advise you to get your order in before the free shipping
[02:32:39.560 --> 02:32:48.360]  deadline September 30th. Free shipping including Alaska and Hawaii end September 30th. Call 800-409-5633
[02:32:48.360 --> 02:32:57.160]  on the web efoodsdirect.com slash alex. That's 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com slash alex.

[02:33:12.280 --> 02:33:16.200]  By now you should have somehow realized what you gotta do.
[02:33:16.200 --> 02:33:20.360]  Okay, let's race through these phone calls because I've got the Obama Antichrist thing
[02:33:20.360 --> 02:33:27.720]  I want to get to. Iran says it could deploy Navy near U.S. coast. Oh, that's a really good idea,
[02:33:27.720 --> 02:33:36.040]  Iran. That's the thing. People aren't cowards, folks. The Iranians are ready to get in a fight,
[02:33:36.040 --> 02:33:40.840]  which is insane, but I guess they're tired of their government being overthrown twice and
[02:33:40.840 --> 02:33:46.200]  everything, but this is just getting insane. I'm gonna get into that. I just don't want war.
[02:33:47.320 --> 02:33:53.560]  That's nuclear weapons, rather live in peace, but just incredible.
[02:33:53.560 --> 02:33:58.200]  Finishing up with Madison in Wisconsin. We're talking about buying in bulk. We need to get
[02:33:58.200 --> 02:34:04.120]  a feature to do that where you can buy friends and family bulk memberships to presentplanet.tv
[02:34:04.120 --> 02:34:12.600]  and then send it to them as kind of an e-card and say, hey, here's your username and passcode
[02:34:12.600 --> 02:34:16.520]  and just kind of make one up for them and then tell them, hey, this is some alternative information
[02:34:16.520 --> 02:34:21.160]  you might check out. And a lot of people are doing that. We've got a bunch of new features
[02:34:21.160 --> 02:34:24.920]  that are about to be added to prisonplanet.tv. We've already seen a lot of the new ones that
[02:34:24.920 --> 02:34:30.680]  have been added in the last month, but finish your point, Madison. Actually, it was several
[02:34:30.680 --> 02:34:36.440]  points, if I may, but I remember back when I was a part of a meetup group and in Pete's Bush
[02:34:36.440 --> 02:34:45.880]  group and then I stumbled onto Loose Change 9-11 that opened up a world for me and some people
[02:34:45.880 --> 02:34:51.640]  in the neonate, you know, when they're in their mother's womb, their parents have them listen
[02:34:51.640 --> 02:34:56.600]  to classical music. Well, I like to say that I was listening to the tick of the 60-minute
[02:34:56.600 --> 02:35:03.160]  stopwatch, which used to be actually a viable news source. And I just want to revisit some
[02:35:03.160 --> 02:35:10.040]  of the really positive feelings like chasing Kissinger up the hill at Bilderberg, Alfred
[02:35:10.040 --> 02:35:16.120]  Apost that you had on recently. He was just fantastic. And the goosebumps, the positive
[02:35:16.120 --> 02:35:21.000]  goosebumps that you talk about, not just the negative ones, what a force. You know, I mean,
[02:35:21.960 --> 02:35:30.680]  we as listeners really love to hear that. And so I really need to get all my NPR listening friends
[02:35:31.320 --> 02:35:36.360]  here in Madison. I have a business with 45 employees, so I can somewhat sympathize with
[02:35:36.360 --> 02:35:44.040]  all of the challenges that you have. And I would love to be a partner in Austin,
[02:35:44.040 --> 02:35:50.280]  North as we sometimes call it, kind of a sister city. Sure, sure. Again, we've got a lot of big
[02:35:50.280 --> 02:36:03.160]  plans, a lot of things we'd like to do. The issue is we're just trying to get our basic
[02:36:03.160 --> 02:36:10.760]  operation up to the next level. And things sound like they're easy and quick to do,
[02:36:11.480 --> 02:36:16.120]  but complex things are complex by the very nature. But I appreciate your call. God bless
[02:36:16.120 --> 02:36:22.520]  you, my friend. I've got to just read this report before I go back to your calls. This is out of
[02:36:22.520 --> 02:36:28.840]  the West Australian News, thewest.com. It's up at infowars.com. It's also the top story
[02:36:28.840 --> 02:36:38.680]  at thedrudgereport.com. Iran threatens warships to U.S. Iran raised the prospect on Tuesday
[02:36:38.680 --> 02:36:42.680]  of sending military ships close to the United States, Atlantic coast, and what would be a
[02:36:42.680 --> 02:36:49.400]  major escalation of tensions between the longstanding adversaries. And again, this is a provocation.
[02:36:51.320 --> 02:36:55.080]  But then you read why Iran's doing it. Like the arrogant powers that are
[02:36:55.080 --> 02:37:01.880]  present near our marine borders, and have even tried to stage attacks on their ships,
[02:37:01.880 --> 02:37:06.200]  on U.S. ships blaming on Iran, remember that came out with Cheney two years ago. Like the
[02:37:06.200 --> 02:37:10.920]  arrogant powers that are present near our marine borders, we will also have a powerful presence
[02:37:10.920 --> 02:37:15.400]  close to the American marine borders. The head of the Navy Rear Admiral
[02:37:15.400 --> 02:37:23.960]  Abbotola Sayiriya said, I know I'm butchering that, according to the official
[02:37:24.920 --> 02:37:31.320]  Iranian news agency. Speaking at a ceremony marking the 31st anniversary of the start
[02:37:31.320 --> 02:37:36.920]  of the 1988 war with Iraq, he gave no details of when such a deployment
[02:37:36.920 --> 02:37:41.320]  that happened with a number of type of vessels to be used. They've got some pretty big destroyers
[02:37:41.320 --> 02:37:47.560]  and battleships. And obviously, the American people are starting to wake up, but not to this level.
[02:37:48.120 --> 02:37:53.400]  Very tribal, very, you know, red, white, and blues. You could wrap cyanide pills in it and
[02:37:53.400 --> 02:37:59.400]  people would eat them. The irony is going to be lost to the American people that there's U.S.
[02:37:59.400 --> 02:38:05.960]  warships and NATO stuff all around them, constantly bordering Iranian ships, constantly in their face.
[02:38:05.960 --> 02:38:11.400]  And so Iran's like, okay, we'll send warships over to you. No, that's terrible. Our media,
[02:38:11.400 --> 02:38:17.640]  our so-called media, whenever a government fires back, like when Libya was firing back at NATO
[02:38:17.640 --> 02:38:21.320]  aircraft, they were like, how dare they fire back as we bomb them. I mean, the news was actually how
[02:38:21.320 --> 02:38:28.520]  dare they fire any aircraft into the sky. This is terrorism. This is aggressive. So a guy walks up
[02:38:28.520 --> 02:38:34.120]  in a restaurant, says, excuse me, breaks your nose, you get up and say, all right, let's fight.
[02:38:34.120 --> 02:38:38.280]  You're like, I can't believe you're putting your fist up. Call the police. The cops get there and
[02:38:38.280 --> 02:38:42.520]  you're like, sir, I just walked over and broke his nose. And then he put his fist up. All right.
[02:38:42.520 --> 02:38:45.320]  And the cops are like, that's terrorism. I agree. Let's take you to jail.
[02:38:49.560 --> 02:38:50.360]  So, uh,
[02:38:55.800 --> 02:39:00.120]  look at this human skin embedded with spider silk and stop a bullet. Raw stories reporting.
[02:39:00.120 --> 02:39:05.800]  That's in news of the weird. Yeah. For more than 15 years, they've had cross spider cross goat
[02:39:05.800 --> 02:39:11.160]  creatures that produce body armor for special forces. That's semi classified body armor,
[02:39:11.160 --> 02:39:19.880]  but it's amazing. The bullets just bounce off reportedly reverse. Government motors won't
[02:39:19.880 --> 02:39:26.840]  track motorists who cancel on star. Uh, that's an announcement by on star. That's not true. I told
[02:39:26.840 --> 02:39:34.760]  you a years ago, they've always tracked you. This goes back years in credible. It just came out again.
[02:39:34.760 --> 02:39:38.360]  I remember two years ago, Tom Tom got caught tracking people and selling it. They were,
[02:39:38.360 --> 02:39:42.440]  and then they said they wouldn't do it anymore. In fact, call doing here because do was bringing
[02:39:42.440 --> 02:39:48.600]  me Tom Tom news yesterday going, look, they're back in the news, the Tom Tom GPS selling your
[02:39:48.600 --> 02:39:53.160]  data. And I said, that's two years old. And I went and showed him. I said, it was new though.
[02:39:53.160 --> 02:39:58.200]  They were back. And then I said, no, let's not go with that because I was thinking, well, we've
[02:39:58.200 --> 02:40:02.920]  already reported that. So what are the mainstream media is reporting it now? But the angle is,
[02:40:02.920 --> 02:40:07.880]  I just remembered it. Come on in bro. I've got the angle on Tom Tom. It was a year and a half ago,
[02:40:07.880 --> 02:40:12.280]  Rob, you know, for the nightly news tonight. It was a year and a half ago. We can even show a
[02:40:12.280 --> 02:40:16.840]  nice camera shot of do and here he's great American help run the nighttime show. In fact,
[02:40:16.840 --> 02:40:19.880]  I got tonight we're gonna have you as a guest on the show talking about how you're lossy against
[02:40:19.880 --> 02:40:24.280]  Pittsburgh police. So in fact, I want you to talk about that briefly since you're in here,
[02:40:24.280 --> 02:40:27.960]  but you were wanting to do Tom Tom tonight yesterday. And I was like, you know, to tie it
[02:40:27.960 --> 02:40:33.880]  into on star, right? And I said, well, that's a year and a half, two years old. But now I understand
[02:40:34.680 --> 02:40:38.840]  the angle to show people Tom Tom got caught a year and a half ago or two years ago doing that.
[02:40:38.840 --> 02:40:43.240]  So on the data, you can pull that up. Then they apologized and said they'd stop. And then it's
[02:40:43.240 --> 02:40:48.680]  back in the news yesterday and today that they're doing it again. Right. Now, now, why do we do
[02:40:48.680 --> 02:40:54.840]  that? We illustrate this playing possum that first they first they get caught, then they say
[02:40:54.840 --> 02:40:58.200]  they're not, then it turns out they are and we'll show that that's what's going on with on star as
[02:40:58.200 --> 02:41:04.120]  well. Because on star has now reversed themselves and said, we're not going to do this now. Yeah,
[02:41:04.120 --> 02:41:08.520]  they've always been doing it. Right. I think it's it's built into their technology. Otherwise,
[02:41:08.520 --> 02:41:13.880]  they wouldn't give that technology to the public. I think I just built in seems like every little
[02:41:13.880 --> 02:41:19.400]  system they build has a little spy function in it, no matter what, like the cell phones.
[02:41:19.400 --> 02:41:23.160]  No, by law, they listen to you. And I told people 15, 16 years ago, I said,
[02:41:23.160 --> 02:41:27.080]  the federal communications telecommunications access by law, they got to be able to turn it
[02:41:27.080 --> 02:41:31.240]  on remotely and listen to you. And the people are like, Oh, shut up. And then a decade later,
[02:41:31.240 --> 02:41:34.840]  it's like your phone's listening to you. It's good. Keeps you safe from al-Qaeda.
[02:41:34.840 --> 02:41:42.360]  Yeah, it's called roving bug. If you want to search that out there, roving bug. And the police in
[02:41:42.360 --> 02:41:46.600]  New York were doing it to track mobsters. Yeah, right. These people not laundering the money
[02:41:46.600 --> 02:41:50.600]  through them. Now listen briefly, because tonight I'm going to have you in as a guest.
[02:41:51.640 --> 02:41:56.600]  You are with Stuart Rhodes of Oath Keepers suing do is suing the Pittsburgh police. We're not
[02:41:56.600 --> 02:42:02.440]  litigious here. I had to defend do in court until they dropped the charges. I had to defend
[02:42:02.440 --> 02:42:06.440]  Aaron at great expense for being arrested for asking a question of Carl Rove.
[02:42:07.080 --> 02:42:11.800]  That went on. I was like $4,000. But they dropped the stuff on do we have the whole footage.
[02:42:11.800 --> 02:42:16.200]  He's outside the court. Them arrested people at a university are not allowed to even eat outside
[02:42:16.200 --> 02:42:20.680]  at night. They come up the hill to do where he's videotaping, let the other mainstream media go
[02:42:20.680 --> 02:42:26.520]  arrest. Do you were with Luke? They were stripping people down naked. Had bags over people's heads
[02:42:26.520 --> 02:42:31.560]  set you out in the rain all night. It was near freezing. And so you are suing them. It was
[02:42:31.560 --> 02:42:35.880]  actually a pretty positive article in the Pittsburgh Post Gazette and other places because
[02:42:35.880 --> 02:42:40.440]  journalists like to stick together. It's one of the few areas you still see some common decency
[02:42:40.440 --> 02:42:45.000]  occasionally in the mainstream corporate horror media. But briefly tell folks about your lawsuit.
[02:42:45.560 --> 02:42:50.440]  Well, we're following a lawsuit myself. I'm following the lawsuit. Stewart Rhodes is my
[02:42:50.440 --> 02:42:56.120]  attorney. And, you know, basically for the fact that they, they detained me, you know,
[02:42:56.680 --> 02:43:00.600]  pushed me around. I was in handcuffs for 12 hours. I was kept outside in the rain.
[02:43:01.640 --> 02:43:05.640]  But you do have long hair. That was like a, I guess I see a skirt coat.
[02:43:05.640 --> 02:43:08.280]  Yeah. Well, not really. Maybe kept my ears warm.
[02:43:08.280 --> 02:43:13.080]  But, uh, I tell you what, the, the, probably the scariest part was when they had put the plastic
[02:43:13.080 --> 02:43:18.120]  cuffs on me. I was kneeling down and I was looking over and they were just walking by to these kids
[02:43:18.120 --> 02:43:21.880]  and spraying mace in their face. And these kids were on the ground, hands behind their back,
[02:43:21.880 --> 02:43:25.480]  and they're just spraying each one in the face, walking up. Kids weren't doing any,
[02:43:25.480 --> 02:43:28.840]  and a lot of these were little college kids. And you described like the cop commander with
[02:43:28.840 --> 02:43:32.360]  the military and you're at this base and they were just looked like psychopaths running around.
[02:43:32.360 --> 02:43:37.400]  Yeah. These guys, they were wearing cert on their, on their uniforms and they had their helmets and
[02:43:37.400 --> 02:43:41.880]  their, you know, their pads. You got footage of like women on bikes. They'd run over with full
[02:43:41.880 --> 02:43:46.120]  power and grunt and like hit him with a billy club. You can kill somebody like that.
[02:43:46.120 --> 02:43:49.160]  Actually, Burma shot that. I mean, you can kill people with your bare hands.
[02:43:49.160 --> 02:43:52.920]  Oh yeah. And I mean, they're, the girls laying down, the cops right on top of her.
[02:43:52.920 --> 02:43:56.680]  And I think Burma says, y'all just remember, she's a girl guys, come on, you know, and she
[02:43:56.680 --> 02:43:59.240]  wasn't doing anything. She was just trying to get out of the way. And that's what everybody,
[02:43:59.240 --> 02:44:03.960]  but I mean, that is the end. That is total tyranny to have just, they couldn't find anybody.
[02:44:03.960 --> 02:44:07.400]  They were said, nobody on the streets day or night. They would just randomly go attack kids
[02:44:07.400 --> 02:44:11.480]  with footballs in their front yards. They're old ladies coming out of stores with bags.
[02:44:11.480 --> 02:44:15.720]  They would release police dogs on them. I mean, it was a psycho police riot. And
[02:44:16.520 --> 02:44:21.000]  this is after this was at, when I got arrested, it was after the G 20 was over. It had been over
[02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:24.760]  for about, you know, the whole day. Exactly. But they were just right around in neighborhoods
[02:44:24.760 --> 02:44:28.760]  saying no one's allowed on the streets. Right. And then it was after and then all the cops were
[02:44:28.760 --> 02:44:32.200]  there and wanted to bust some heads. So they went to the university and we've got the footage.
[02:44:32.200 --> 02:44:36.680]  It wasn't even protesters. It's people outside at like nine at night, eating hamburgers.
[02:44:36.680 --> 02:44:41.160]  And here come cops. They kettle everybody and then just, and women are on bikes going and the
[02:44:41.160 --> 02:44:46.760]  cops literally the cowardice of a guy wanting to run up to a woman and crack a belly club over
[02:44:46.760 --> 02:44:52.040]  their head. Women falling off, crying and the cops are having like weird satanic orgasms.
[02:44:52.040 --> 02:44:56.120]  Well, and now you got the cops doing that in New York. I've been watching that video of,
[02:44:56.120 --> 02:45:00.200]  you know, attacking, surrounding women with these orange nets and then spraying them in
[02:45:00.200 --> 02:45:04.840]  the face with mace. And these are women. They're not there. That's like, uh, it's ridiculous.
[02:45:04.840 --> 02:45:07.960]  That was like the first thing where the Delta four stage, the whole event. That was even in the
[02:45:08.520 --> 02:45:14.120]  mainstream news at the time. Uh, 1999 Seattle, they went into neighborhoods and would like pull
[02:45:14.120 --> 02:45:17.960]  families over in cars and just pepper spray. And it's on video to my film, police state to the
[02:45:17.960 --> 02:45:23.880]  takeover. I mean, again, they're trying to hire cops now who want to beat you and your wife.
[02:45:23.880 --> 02:45:27.560]  And why don't the cops realize that they're next on the list? Once they do the bidding,
[02:45:27.560 --> 02:45:32.120]  they're going to get turned on by the next group of psychopaths that come along. And they need to
[02:45:32.120 --> 02:45:36.040]  realize and they need to wake up and they need to start, you know, siding with the protesters
[02:45:36.040 --> 02:45:39.480]  because we're all in this together. Yeah. But in your case, you were at the university. Oh,
[02:45:39.480 --> 02:45:43.720]  yeah. And I was covering the event. I was not protesting. I've got plenty of footage. I am
[02:45:43.720 --> 02:45:48.920]  not saying a word other than, you know, people are asking me who I worked for and whatnot. And
[02:45:48.920 --> 02:45:52.120]  you're up on a hill. You're out of it all. Oh yeah. Well, by that time I'd gone up the hill,
[02:45:52.120 --> 02:45:55.960]  but I was covering, um, there was some, they march up to you. Oh yeah. They had,
[02:45:55.960 --> 02:46:01.960]  they had cordoned off the area and then somebody released on the internet of the scanners and
[02:46:01.960 --> 02:46:05.720]  they're calling out military maneuvers. They're blocking people in, you know, they're like,
[02:46:05.720 --> 02:46:08.600]  hold right here till we get the guys up on top of the hill. Yeah, they're like,
[02:46:08.600 --> 02:46:12.200]  now disperse. They won't let you leave. Exactly. Cause they're like, yeah, we're going to beat
[02:46:12.200 --> 02:46:18.280]  some hippies. Oh, you're one of you guys go join a gym, you know, go join some martial arts thing
[02:46:18.280 --> 02:46:23.960]  and go fight men if you're so tough. Yeah. I mean, I just running up to women on bicycles and
[02:46:23.960 --> 02:46:28.200]  grunting with hatred, you know, you're going to start when you kill people's family members
[02:46:28.760 --> 02:46:32.200]  and hurt them. You're going to have people, I mean, you know, there's justice in this universe.
[02:46:33.240 --> 02:46:37.320]  I mean, I got to tell you folks, I'm not a tough guy and repeatedly I got in fist fights and,
[02:46:37.320 --> 02:46:40.840]  you know, would be in court and stuff with some guy, you know, in a coma for six weeks and
[02:46:40.840 --> 02:46:45.160]  had to go through all this crap. And so I know what fist and clubs can do to people.
[02:46:45.160 --> 02:46:50.600]  And these guys are hitting people with clubs full power in the head. You kill people that way.
[02:46:50.600 --> 02:46:55.000]  They hit Luke that night. They hit, he was trying to leave and they started hitting him and that's
[02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:59.480]  how he ended up getting into the spot where I was. And I shot a brief interview with him right
[02:46:59.480 --> 02:47:05.160]  before I got detained, arrested. I don't know what to call it because they never charged me with
[02:47:05.160 --> 02:47:10.440]  anything that night. So it was just, you know, I'm at a loss to still how they could get away with
[02:47:10.440 --> 02:47:16.760]  that with all those people out there. After the G 20, it wasn't even anywhere near that location
[02:47:16.760 --> 02:47:22.360]  where the G 20 was. And it really changed my attitudes on police. And it's a night that changed
[02:47:22.360 --> 02:47:26.440]  my life because I had to sit up all night. They wouldn't let you fall asleep. They brought us
[02:47:26.440 --> 02:47:30.040]  outside. It was cold and rainy. They had people with bags on their heads. Oh yeah. They brought
[02:47:30.040 --> 02:47:35.000]  one guy in. He was, they had four guys on him and he was literally hyperventilating as they
[02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:38.840]  brought him in. I mean, he sound very stressed out, a skinny little dude. Like I could have probably
[02:47:38.840 --> 02:47:43.080]  picked the guy up with one hand and they're dragging him in. They have a bag over his head.
[02:47:43.080 --> 02:47:48.280]  They put him in a cell and I'm not sure if they, if he was naked or whatnot after that,
[02:47:48.280 --> 02:47:51.880]  but they put a camera on him and they had a cop right outside the door watching him the whole
[02:47:51.880 --> 02:47:56.520]  time. Like this guy was some, you know, he was nothing but a, you know, well, it doesn't matter.
[02:47:56.520 --> 02:48:00.440]  It doesn't matter. They were there protecting the banker lords. Remember the footage of guys in
[02:48:00.440 --> 02:48:06.440]  uniforms grabbing peaceful protesters and snatching and grabbing. And then we got contacted by the
[02:48:06.440 --> 02:48:12.840]  G 20 and they said, that is not us army. That is our personnel to correct us that it wasn't army.
[02:48:12.840 --> 02:48:16.840]  So, so they had private people kidnapping folks. Dude, we'll talk more about it tonight. Good
[02:48:16.840 --> 02:48:22.920]  job. See you tonight at seven. Thank you, buddy boy. He lived in Switzerland for a while. The
[02:48:22.920 --> 02:48:27.480]  guy would go, hello, buddy boy. So that's his name around here is buddy boy. Let me bring
[02:48:27.480 --> 02:48:34.840]  up the ComRex system here. Let's go to Scott in Washington who disagrees. Go ahead, Scotty.
[02:48:34.840 --> 02:48:43.800]  Yeah. What I wanted to bring up this point and I also have a suggestion actually for Jesse was
[02:48:44.520 --> 02:48:50.360]  if he was suggesting that Ron Paul should quit right now during these primary.
[02:48:50.360 --> 02:48:54.440]  No, we should do it after. I brought that up and Ventura agree with me quit after.
[02:48:55.000 --> 02:49:00.200]  Yeah, because yeah, because one problem is, and we know he's already having a problem getting
[02:49:00.200 --> 02:49:05.960]  into getting time in these debates. The other thing that I would correct him in is that the
[02:49:05.960 --> 02:49:12.520]  libertarian, when he says that they have ballot access in all 50 states, that's not guaranteed.
[02:49:12.520 --> 02:49:18.200]  They claim the last time that they had ballot access in 48 states and they only ended up being
[02:49:18.200 --> 02:49:23.000]  on the ballot in 41 states down there in your own home state down there in Texas.
[02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:31.960]  This was when Bob Barr and I am no fan of him tried to sue to get on that ballot access down
[02:49:31.960 --> 02:49:37.560]  there. They threw that case out of there and McCain and Obama should not even have been on
[02:49:37.560 --> 02:49:42.760]  the ballot access there because they missed the deadline to announce. Let me just be clear.
[02:49:42.760 --> 02:49:47.800]  Ron Paul could win and it's starting to look like he may if the two top guys get knocked off,
[02:49:47.800 --> 02:49:51.560]  which is starting to happen because they have such political baggage and we just use it,
[02:49:51.560 --> 02:49:58.440]  it's over for him. But Ron Paul wins if he goes third party after he loses the primary,
[02:49:58.440 --> 02:50:03.160]  if that was to happen, to just be in there shaking it up. That will get so much energy
[02:50:03.800 --> 02:50:08.440]  and it will absolutely put real issues front and center and will totally expose
[02:50:08.440 --> 02:50:12.040]  whatever Republican horror gets in there, you know, with the Republican nomination
[02:50:12.040 --> 02:50:18.040]  and Obama and the Obamanoids, the Obamanoids, whatever you call them,
[02:50:18.040 --> 02:50:23.960]  the Obamazombies, the Obamanoids, whatever you want to call them. And so it's win, win, win.
[02:50:23.960 --> 02:50:27.320]  I mean, don't you agree that if Paul gets cheated out of the primary, he should go
[02:50:27.320 --> 02:50:31.640]  through third party just for the circus? I'm not saying that he shouldn't do that.
[02:50:31.640 --> 02:50:36.440]  If it were up to me, I would eliminate the party system altogether and just run on issues.
[02:50:36.440 --> 02:50:40.680]  But, you know, I'm just saying that, you know, you have to realize what you're going to be in.
[02:50:40.680 --> 02:50:44.840]  Here he is. Is that what you disagree with? Well, yeah. And then I wanted to make a quick
[02:50:44.840 --> 02:50:51.160]  suggestion for Jesse that if he wanted to consider being his running mate, there's no law that says
[02:50:51.160 --> 02:50:56.760]  that that he would have to be at the same party. He could still run as an independent if he wanted to.
[02:50:56.760 --> 02:51:00.520]  And then later be picked to be his vice president. Another great point. Well,
[02:51:00.520 --> 02:51:05.160]  they're right back. Stay with us. OpticsPlanet is calling all hunters, shooters, and outdoorsmen.

[02:52:00.840 --> 02:52:06.840]  Our rights as individuals to freely purchase dietary supplements over the counter are under
[02:52:06.840 --> 02:52:12.520]  constant attack. The globalists want to ban all supplements formulated after 1994. Governments
[02:52:12.520 --> 02:52:17.720]  are hoarding raw materials, affecting our ability to purchase these products at a reasonable price.

[02:54:11.480 --> 02:54:16.680]  That's right, the system of the pretenders. What if I say I'll never surrender?
[02:54:16.680 --> 02:54:23.000]  All right, Chris Chrissy is set again. He's a no-go. Paul shows Kane on top of Perry. Perry
[02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:31.080]  is plummeting in all polls as folks learn that the guy literally is basically like Bill Clinton.
[02:54:31.080 --> 02:54:37.480]  I mean, he is a piece of work. Also, Paul trails Obama by just four points and I've seen some
[02:54:37.480 --> 02:54:43.640]  polls where Ron Paul beats Obama, but Ron Paul has the best showing in every poll against Obama.
[02:54:43.640 --> 02:54:54.840]  He can beat him, but Perry is just plunging right now. They're saying that Ron Paul can't win.
[02:54:54.840 --> 02:54:59.560]  That's because they know he will win if we get behind him, but he wins by fighting back and
[02:54:59.560 --> 02:55:03.560]  getting the word out regardless. So if he loses, I don't want to hear a bunch of whining,
[02:55:03.560 --> 02:55:08.200]  and I gave them money and didn't do anything. Rome wasn't built in the day. We're not going
[02:55:08.200 --> 02:55:11.880]  to pull this new world order down in a day either. The Republic wasn't built in a day.
[02:55:11.880 --> 02:55:15.640]  All right, I'm going to overdrive a little bit and get to all these callers that are holding,
[02:55:15.640 --> 02:55:19.880]  but I wanted to go to Ted Anderson briefly, drug him in there to give us an update. Ted,
[02:55:19.880 --> 02:55:26.440]  Golden Silver are starting to rebound some. We know they've called the margins, cut them to where
[02:55:26.440 --> 02:55:32.600]  basically killing all speculation in Europe, Asia, and here. France has announced that they want to
[02:55:32.600 --> 02:55:38.440]  basically ban and track the sales of gold $600 and above. So they're definitely trying to
[02:55:38.440 --> 02:55:43.720]  send down Golden Silver, but as they devalue currencies, market fundamentals say it's only
[02:55:43.720 --> 02:55:48.200]  going to go up in the long run. We've seen these major force corrections before.
[02:55:48.200 --> 02:55:50.440]  What do we see happening with Golden Silver right now, Ted?
[02:55:51.240 --> 02:55:59.160]  Well, you know, Silver hit a high today of $33.02, opened up its low at $32.15, currently at $32.25,
[02:55:59.160 --> 02:56:05.320]  up $1.40. Gold is up $21.70. Alex, they are, they're trying, like I said yesterday,
[02:56:05.320 --> 02:56:09.560]  they're throwing everything, including the kitchen sink at precious metals to try to keep it down.
[02:56:10.360 --> 02:56:15.880]  These margin requirements in the futures market is just one thing, but here's what happened yesterday.
[02:56:15.880 --> 02:56:20.680]  The demand for jewelry in India just shot up like crazy. I mean, I wasn't in India,
[02:56:20.680 --> 02:56:25.560]  but I was in Singapore and I seen what it looked like in those shops and these people are standing
[02:56:25.560 --> 02:56:29.960]  in line trying to buy gold chains because they can see what's going on. The United States is no
[02:56:29.960 --> 02:56:35.720]  different. Here at Midas, we had lots of people calling wanting to buy gold and silver at this
[02:56:35.720 --> 02:56:42.040]  better price. And that's, you know, it's just because of the fact that people know that the
[02:56:42.040 --> 02:56:47.080]  United States is going down, that Europe is going down, that Asia is in no better shape,
[02:56:47.080 --> 02:56:52.040]  and this whole house of cards is all being propped up by, what are they going to legislate,
[02:56:52.040 --> 02:56:56.040]  that we can't sell gold and silver now? Confiscation, is that what they're looking at?
[02:56:56.040 --> 02:57:01.400]  I mean, the people know that the governments at hand are trying to force people into this funny
[02:57:02.040 --> 02:57:08.040]  paper money and it's just, you know, it's just a bad solution for anybody and they want to get
[02:57:08.040 --> 02:57:12.440]  out of it. So yeah, there's a lot of demand for gold and silver gold being up today. So we're
[02:57:12.440 --> 02:57:18.280]  being up today. Today is a testimonial to that. A couple of things. I mean, I held that, that
[02:57:18.280 --> 02:57:23.800]  your book in the video offer that we're doing for 78 bucks delivered, still the same price as
[02:57:23.800 --> 02:57:29.400]  yesterday. Silver's up, you know, it was $27 yesterday right now, $32.25.
[02:57:29.400 --> 02:57:32.680]  No, there's no doubt, Ted, and you've told me last night and this morning,
[02:57:33.320 --> 02:57:36.920]  unlike other force corrections, people have pretty much figured out the pattern now.
[02:57:37.960 --> 02:57:42.840]  Correct me if I'm wrong, you're saying you're seeing record purchasing in a dip,
[02:57:42.840 --> 02:57:49.480]  which is the old stock maxim of advice on Wall Street, buy low, sell high. You're saying you're
[02:57:49.480 --> 02:57:54.520]  actually seeing people finally come in and use this as a brisk time to purchase.
[02:57:55.080 --> 02:57:59.880]  I can tell you right now, Alex, our activity increased by about 10-fold from the last couple
[02:57:59.880 --> 02:58:03.480]  of weeks to now. Wow, so, so, but that's never happened before, Ted?
[02:58:03.480 --> 02:58:08.200]  No, no, usually when the market is going down, it gets quiet. You can hear a pin drop around
[02:58:08.200 --> 02:58:13.000]  this office, but not, not now. People are looking at the headline news. They're seeing that things
[02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:18.440]  are melting apart. I mean, Germany is talking about not bailing out, you know, Greece. I mean,
[02:58:18.440 --> 02:58:25.000]  this is what's going on. Incredible. Ted, 800-686-2237. Give the Midas Resources team a call.
[02:58:26.040 --> 02:58:29.800]  If the phone's busy, leave your name and number, because they are. The phones are on fire.
[02:58:30.360 --> 02:58:35.800]  It was busy a few weeks ago. I can't imagine 10-fold, 800-686-2237. By the way,
[02:58:36.520 --> 02:58:42.920]  we have a poll that Ron Paul is beating. Beating Obama. It's on infowarch.com. Get it out to
[02:58:42.920 --> 02:58:50.440]  everybody. Thank you for listening to GCN. It's powerful. It's powerful. It's powerful.

[02:59:41.080 --> 02:59:47.480]  By calling 800-340-7091 or see Calben on the Web at 5starsoap.com.
[03:00:12.040 --> 03:00:17.400]  Okay, we're in a little five-minute overdrive, kind of like a reserve on the tank,
[03:00:18.040 --> 03:00:22.120]  able to go to a few final calls. I just want to add this is a new article
[03:00:23.080 --> 03:00:30.920]  up on infowars.com in the featured news section. Harris poll, Ron Paul would beat Obama, 51 to 49.
[03:00:30.920 --> 03:00:41.000]  Drudge Report has another one saying that Ron Paul's only a few points behind Obama.
[03:00:41.160 --> 03:00:47.400]  And Drudge is linked, by the way, and I guess I didn't notice this earlier. Did you guys notice
[03:00:47.400 --> 03:00:51.880]  the red link we had on Drudge Report today? I didn't even get to this. I mentioned this at
[03:00:51.880 --> 03:01:01.960]  the start of the show and I didn't even cover this today. I totally forgot about this. Patron's
[03:01:01.960 --> 03:01:08.360]  mistake ice cream shop mascot for KKK. They have this here in Austin at ice cream shops.
[03:01:08.360 --> 03:01:14.120]  It's a guy with a cone body of a sugar cone with some vanilla ice cream and sprinkles on top.
[03:01:14.120 --> 03:01:23.720]  And the White House admits their strategy is race war.
[03:01:26.520 --> 03:01:30.600]  By that, the White House says their strategy is going to be racial. They've admitted that,
[03:01:30.600 --> 03:01:34.920]  which will lead to a possible race war. They didn't say race war. I had a Freudian slip.
[03:01:34.920 --> 03:01:39.160]  Their policy behind the scenes is race war, but they're pushing racial tension.
[03:01:39.160 --> 03:01:47.160]  But AP labelled racist for accurately transcribing Obama's speech. And this is a Paul Watson
[03:01:47.160 --> 03:01:52.600]  article. MSNBC is obsessed with playing the race card. And we got the big Drudge love up there
[03:01:53.560 --> 03:01:58.200]  up at infowars.com. But if you go to Drudge, you know, I was looking at Drudge throughout
[03:01:58.200 --> 03:02:05.160]  the day along with infowars.com. I never saw that red link. Is that new? MSNBC labels AP
[03:02:05.160 --> 03:02:12.200]  inherently racist for accurate translation of Obama's speech. Did you guys see that earlier
[03:02:12.200 --> 03:02:17.240]  today? Or did that just? It's probably new because I was reading that Ron Paul stuff.
[03:02:17.240 --> 03:02:19.000]  Anyway, it's going back to what he's got there.
[03:02:23.080 --> 03:02:28.520]  It's got the Paul Trails Obama in by just four points. That's LA Times. That's the way they,
[03:02:28.520 --> 03:02:32.360]  I got a poll where he's ahead. Side issue. I said I'd go to overdrive to take calls
[03:02:32.360 --> 03:02:36.120]  and they look like that's going to happen. I'm out of control. Let's go to Bill in Connecticut.
[03:02:36.120 --> 03:02:42.520]  Bill, thanks for holding. Yeah. Hi, Alex. How you doing? Good. Thank you. I just have
[03:02:42.520 --> 03:02:49.080]  three quick points I'd like to make. The first is Ron Paul in these debates. What's happening is
[03:02:49.800 --> 03:02:54.680]  they're asking him questions that are basically impertinent. They have nothing to do with anything.
[03:02:54.680 --> 03:03:01.880]  And so what I'd like him to do, if he's possibly listening, is to bring up a couple of key points.
[03:03:02.680 --> 03:03:07.160]  One, that the Federal Reserve, the private corporation, has been unconstitutionally
[03:03:07.880 --> 03:03:12.760]  charging. Yeah, no. He needs, he's such a gentleman. He needs to get on the offensive.
[03:03:12.760 --> 03:03:16.520]  Number one, they give him the least amount of time. Well, now Gary Johnson gets even less,
[03:03:16.520 --> 03:03:21.720]  but he's next to last. And they just sit there and throw him baloney questions. I mean, the fix
[03:03:21.720 --> 03:03:27.000]  is in. That's all the endorsement you need. The whores don't like him. What does that tell the public?
[03:03:28.680 --> 03:03:35.560]  Right. And he has to get control and go off point. He's got to go more renegade and address
[03:03:35.560 --> 03:03:42.040]  points that are really critical to our country. Yes. And the Federal Reserve is at the crux of
[03:03:42.040 --> 03:03:48.120]  all the criminality imposed upon us for the past 98 years. And that has to be brought out.
[03:03:48.120 --> 03:03:53.000]  The other thing I'd like him to do is to turn in this point you brought up is to turn to Governor
[03:03:53.000 --> 03:03:58.600]  Perry and saying what he was, what were you doing at the Bilderberg and what were you talking about
[03:03:58.600 --> 03:04:05.320]  there? And also point out to him that it's a violation of the Logan law and it's a felony.
[03:04:05.320 --> 03:04:10.360]  Well, I think it's important. I don't want to mirage Ron Paul with stuff, but that's your opinion.
[03:04:10.360 --> 03:04:15.400]  I agree with your opinion. And list listeners, you have a right to let Ron Paul know what you
[03:04:15.400 --> 03:04:20.040]  think you should do. I'm not saying call Ron Paul advice, because I know they're very busy,
[03:04:20.040 --> 03:04:25.160]  but I do know he listens to you. And so go out on the campaign trail. I think that's most important.
[03:04:25.160 --> 03:04:30.120]  Look where Ron Paul's coming next and be there to greet him and have a little printout. You know
[03:04:30.120 --> 03:04:35.240]  he's getting it. And if he hears it from 20 people on the street the next week, he will do that.
[03:04:35.240 --> 03:04:40.120]  And then that'll cause a whole new national debate like with Gardasil about what's Bilderberg.
[03:04:40.120 --> 03:04:44.200]  By the way, Perry admits he's gone there. We played a clip of that last night. We have
[03:04:44.200 --> 03:04:49.880]  that last night. We have got a power pack transmission tonight. Seven o'clock central
[03:04:49.880 --> 03:04:54.040]  in four Wars nightly news. Great job to the crew. Great job to Genesis. Great job to you,
[03:04:54.040 --> 03:05:15.080]  the listeners. Now join us tonight at seven o'clock. We'll see you back tomorrow at 11 a.m.
