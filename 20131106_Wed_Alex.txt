[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:20.760]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.760 --> 00:30.240]  I wasn't going to start the broadcast with this but it just popped into my head a
[00:30.240 --> 00:34.600]  realization I mean I realize it all the time it really hit me how important it
[00:34.600 --> 00:40.520]  is why do you think they're going after Rand Paul he's introduced legislation to
[00:40.520 --> 00:43.920]  where members of the House and Senate members of the Congress will have to be
[00:43.920 --> 00:49.560]  under whatever laws they put on the American people in almost every case as
[00:49.560 --> 00:53.760]  you know it's it's very common knowledge Congress but they also do this over in
[00:53.760 --> 00:59.880]  Europe any socialist regime does it any authoritarian regime does it look at the
[00:59.880 --> 01:04.840]  book by Orwell Animal Farm where first they say four legs good two legs bad by
[01:04.840 --> 01:08.200]  the end of it the pigs who are representing into the tyrants the
[01:08.200 --> 01:12.440]  humans they start out fighting them they've now taken over the House and
[01:12.440 --> 01:18.280]  they're now saying actually two legs two legs good four legs bad yet again the
[01:18.280 --> 01:22.560]  reverse of what they claimed the whole revolution had been about meet the new
[01:22.560 --> 01:29.960]  boss same as the old boss as the who say so we love to get fooled again and again
[01:29.960 --> 01:38.320]  and again and again but it just hit me that until we I was thinking about how
[01:38.320 --> 01:41.960]  they've got over 50% of the public now on some form of welfare government
[01:41.960 --> 01:47.120]  assistance and why that's game over for any society they will always end up
[01:47.120 --> 01:50.800]  collapsing and I've got a bunch of news showing that today around the world but
[01:50.800 --> 01:54.440]  that the globalists have set it up to where they collapse all the rest of the
[01:54.440 --> 01:59.920]  economies they don't control to consolidate it and then exempt themselves
[01:59.920 --> 02:05.520]  from everything they're doing to everyone else because the elites aren't
[02:05.520 --> 02:09.720]  going to let them go to a hundred percent taxation on the middle class like
[02:09.720 --> 02:15.200]  France has done to bankrupt everybody unless they're exempt and outside of it
[02:15.200 --> 02:18.800]  just like the socialists have been caught the entire leadership with
[02:18.800 --> 02:23.800]  multi-billions of euros this year in foreign bank accounts and because they
[02:23.800 --> 02:30.400]  control the police and the prosecutors no one got in trouble this is biblical
[02:30.400 --> 02:34.240]  level corruption when members of the Communist Party in China get caught
[02:34.240 --> 02:42.720]  doing this they get executed they get executed now sure they let themselves
[02:42.720 --> 02:46.880]  get insider deals and get wealthy but they pay the taxes you don't pay the
[02:46.880 --> 02:55.560]  taxes you get executed there is unlimited level of of implosion and
[02:55.560 --> 02:59.560]  degradation of society Thomas Jefferson was asked when he was president he
[02:59.560 --> 03:02.960]  said what is the level of absolute tyranny because he was asked what is
[03:02.960 --> 03:06.240]  your level of absolute liberty by a French philosopher I forget I was
[03:06.240 --> 03:10.320]  reading a book a decade ago about it like what is total freedom and then
[03:10.320 --> 03:15.400]  Jefferson described his definition of that to a French statesman a philosopher
[03:15.400 --> 03:18.520]  that was visiting him at the White House and then that he said well what is
[03:18.520 --> 03:24.480]  what is total tyranny he said whatever you will put up with someone will come
[03:24.480 --> 03:32.440]  along who has an appetite for that and the worst will become the the baseline to
[03:32.440 --> 03:35.960]  use my analogy it's like a black hole the absolute center of corruption that is
[03:35.960 --> 03:44.000]  it so that's the issue here is that we've got to talk about how Congress is
[03:44.000 --> 03:48.560]  exempt the UN's exempt Berkshire Hathaway's exempt from all these big taxes
[03:48.560 --> 03:52.960]  and regulations and even uses that point to try to get more taxes passed but
[03:52.960 --> 03:57.680]  doesn't regulate and doesn't move to get themselves taxed they even use that
[03:57.680 --> 04:01.520]  inequality as a way to jack up taxes on the middle class and new rich I mean
[04:01.520 --> 04:05.640]  it's incredible and we've just got to get that message out of the middle class
[04:05.640 --> 04:08.920]  the independently wealthy that are legitimately wealthy that are the
[04:08.920 --> 04:14.160]  engine of liberty and innovation we've got to get the good middle class the
[04:14.160 --> 04:18.320]  good working class who want to become middle class and rich and the good new
[04:18.320 --> 04:22.680]  vorice there's even some good old money out there to really understand we're
[04:22.680 --> 04:27.000]  under attack and not just go along with it because so many people do the Atlas
[04:27.000 --> 04:30.680]  shrugs thing so many successful people just punch out they stop
[04:30.680 --> 04:35.440]  innovating they stop hiring as if that's gonna defeat the usurpers they use
[04:35.440 --> 04:40.540]  surpers count on all the doctors to quit the usurpers count on all the
[04:40.540 --> 04:44.960]  business people to just quit they got enough money to never work again sell
[04:44.960 --> 04:49.000]  their businesses off for the globalist but the globalist want that don't do
[04:49.000 --> 04:53.520]  that keep fighting it's the fighting spirit it will defeat them we've got

[09:44.520 --> 09:50.120]  the word is folks it is the litmus test that we broke last year and then
[09:50.120 --> 09:54.760]  confirmed triple confirmed this year in the last few weeks quadruple confirmed
[09:54.760 --> 10:01.280]  from recently retired Navy SEALs talking to high-level officers like Ben
[10:01.280 --> 10:06.280]  Smith right through to our military police friends sitting sending us
[10:06.280 --> 10:17.240]  video out of a briefing of military police in Arizona absolutely 100%
[10:17.240 --> 10:22.120]  undoubtedly and it just hit me this morning I walked into my TV reporters
[10:22.120 --> 10:27.480]  to my print reporters and I said listen just because we've been the experts on
[10:27.480 --> 10:31.280]  this and been out front on it no one knows we've been reporting on this for
[10:31.280 --> 10:34.880]  the year we've got a really all right articles about this including Paul
[10:34.880 --> 10:40.360]  Watson and Steve Watson everybody on every angle of this because folks are
[10:40.360 --> 10:48.360]  finally talking and the military now down to sergeants are being asked will
[10:48.360 --> 10:54.360]  you fire on American citizens are you ready and they have now fired upwards
[10:54.360 --> 11:07.760]  of 200 ladies and gentlemen 200 top military brass admirals generals and
[11:07.760 --> 11:11.840]  right down to kernels in fact there's one of our articles from January on it
[11:11.840 --> 11:17.480]  nine months ago or I guess 11 months ago now well time just flies Nobel Prize
[11:17.480 --> 11:23.040]  nominee Obama asked military leaders and they will fire on US citizens and then
[11:23.040 --> 11:27.560]  I confirmed that that was in the new manuals we got the manuals posted them
[11:27.560 --> 11:32.560]  that they're training to carry out military operations including saying
[11:32.560 --> 11:36.280]  the American people has hostiles during coordinating of cities gun
[11:36.280 --> 11:40.960]  confiscation Stuart Rhodes the head of Oathkeepers it says that it's just
[11:40.960 --> 11:44.960]  flooding him with special warfare saying that they're being prepared for as
[11:44.960 --> 11:50.200]  well and it's and and they're freaking out I mean as they should be and I told
[11:50.200 --> 11:53.960]  you they're not gonna just gear all this up and then not have a reason to
[11:53.960 --> 12:00.800]  launch troops against us they will stage mass shootings they will bomb
[12:00.800 --> 12:06.960]  buildings they will attack shopping malls and they will blame us this is
[12:06.960 --> 12:12.480]  just basic a b c d e f g takeover operations this is how communists and
[12:12.480 --> 12:16.640]  subversives when they're in control of the executive do it they stage stuff they
[12:16.640 --> 12:20.680]  blame it on you and then they launch the military against you to find out who
[12:20.680 --> 12:26.880]  won't follow orders the military calls the the the resistance the counter
[12:26.880 --> 12:32.720]  revolutionaries the American people the red white and blue the good guys they
[12:32.720 --> 12:36.880]  knock us out tears up the military in the same process then they purge the
[12:36.880 --> 12:41.760]  military now first they purge them in a non-blood bloody purge historically it
[12:41.760 --> 12:44.600]  always works the same this is I mean this has been done for thousands of years
[12:44.600 --> 12:49.640]  the and and and the and tyrants study it and know the most effective program so
[12:49.640 --> 12:54.040]  let me know from a historical based analysis integrated with all the current
[12:54.040 --> 12:59.440]  info all the pieces of the puzzle are now in place I just got chills I'm
[12:59.440 --> 13:03.960]  basically living in chills now I just cannot believe that that we're in this
[13:03.960 --> 13:09.280]  much trouble and zoom in I've actually got goosebumps ladies and gentlemen right
[13:09.280 --> 13:15.000]  now you don't need to literally zoom into my ugly face but the point is this is
[13:15.000 --> 13:18.840]  real I'm not up here on the air just saying this because it's sensational
[13:18.840 --> 13:25.600]  reality is sensational if I wanted to be on 500 radio stations instead of 160
[13:25.600 --> 13:28.640]  something I would have shut up a long time ago I'm been a mainline kind of
[13:28.640 --> 13:33.360]  libertarian Republican which now I've basically forced all of them to face
[13:33.360 --> 13:38.200]  reality and they've become me instead of me becoming them I call that total
[13:38.200 --> 13:42.520]  victory in the info war at that level now we're going to win the other big
[13:42.520 --> 13:48.120]  victories and I'm on a power trip by the way realizing that we've leveraged with
[13:48.120 --> 13:52.040]  drugs report calm helping us as well right there at the heart of it I hate to
[13:52.040 --> 13:54.520]  even admit that because the enemy knows that and freaks out about it every day
[13:54.520 --> 13:59.120]  on national television but the point is and world net daily and now Glenn Beck
[13:59.120 --> 14:03.320]  is really getting on board and not making fun of us anymore I deserve an
[14:03.320 --> 14:07.800]  apology from Glenn a lot of fronts over the years but I don't even care I I
[14:07.800 --> 14:11.200]  want to see everybody wake up rush limbaugh talking about our government
[14:11.200 --> 14:16.440]  running al-qaeda staging chemical attacks I go on big syndicated shows all
[14:16.440 --> 14:22.320]  the time like man cow and others and now the callers the the the listeners the
[14:22.320 --> 14:26.320]  general managers the network heads they're all freaking out because they
[14:26.320 --> 14:31.360]  get this is all real it's happening it isn't a game and you got a bunch of
[14:31.360 --> 14:35.560]  Republican collaborators going along with this and it's when I say this is
[14:35.560 --> 14:39.720]  real to myself I get chills you're supposed to get chills when you realize
[14:39.720 --> 14:44.800]  the bad guys have absolutely taken control and those chills are your body
[14:44.800 --> 14:48.480]  getting ready for war ladies and gentlemen that's your body flipping the
[14:48.480 --> 14:54.080]  switches for combat I mean that's what it is and I'm not going out in a in a
[14:54.080 --> 14:59.680]  physical combat never for attack knowledge in defense is is you know what I
[14:59.680 --> 15:04.640]  use my aggressive killer instincts for and I use my killer instincts with the
[15:04.640 --> 15:09.680]  truth in the info war as viciously as I can just firing the truth at the enemy
[15:09.680 --> 15:15.120]  over and over again never backing down and the fact that we have been able to
[15:15.120 --> 15:19.000]  leverage the libertarians the conservatives the real tea party and
[15:19.000 --> 15:24.680]  now even what I'd call libertarian left to now wake up and it's happening fast
[15:24.680 --> 15:31.680]  Obama it now has a 28% 29% in a fake Gallup poll it's more like 19% even his
[15:31.680 --> 15:37.760]  own acolytes are now realizing what's happening and they've got major general
[15:37.760 --> 15:44.000]  after major general after major general after major general by the way I could
[15:44.000 --> 15:49.800]  have gotten Boykin on six months ago former head of special forces incredibly
[15:49.800 --> 15:54.440]  highly decorated and for some reason he wanted me personally to calling and shut
[15:54.440 --> 15:58.360]  it up and I never get it now John bounds in there calling him I just remembered
[15:58.360 --> 16:03.320]  I'm supposed to call Boykin first yeah you're getting his answering machine yeah
[16:03.320 --> 16:07.160]  no I was given a window in February to get him on and I didn't do it and I was
[16:07.160 --> 16:11.080]  supposed to call him first because I had some folks reach out to me that work
[16:11.080 --> 16:14.000]  with him that made a film with him so just I remind me at the end of the show I
[16:14.000 --> 16:18.240]  just had that epiphany or that I just remembered I need to call Boykin the
[16:18.240 --> 16:25.720]  point is is that is that and again the word from Boykin then was that that's
[16:25.720 --> 16:30.920]  what was going on and you see I'm almost blind because I'm so close to this and
[16:30.920 --> 16:35.560]  so hyper aware that there's a blind spot when you're hyper aware where you
[16:35.560 --> 16:38.480]  become comfortable with all this stuff and then it's not even threatening
[16:38.480 --> 16:42.080]  anymore and that's actually the psychological warfare they use on the
[16:42.080 --> 16:45.280]  general public ever wonder why they put movies what they're planning before
[16:45.280 --> 16:49.120]  they do it they admit so your subconscious is prepared well it's the
[16:49.120 --> 16:53.440]  same thing I'm consciously and subconsciously lived with this for so
[16:53.440 --> 16:57.960]  long and and the reason I talk about myself as I know you've lived with this
[16:57.960 --> 17:02.960]  so long military people police FBI folks that are being trained in all this that
[17:02.960 --> 17:07.480]  even though you don't like it they think that when things get bad enough just
[17:07.480 --> 17:11.120]  under the peer pressure you will go through the motions and carry out this
[17:11.120 --> 17:18.400]  treason even when you know the false flags that are going to happen don't add
[17:18.400 --> 17:24.560]  up but I've always known it's key to assault the false flag because even if
[17:24.560 --> 17:28.640]  some of these events are real and stuff happens and I go that's got to be real
[17:28.640 --> 17:31.840]  and then it's comes out it's a false flag and I'm like well I guess that they
[17:31.840 --> 17:35.880]  are false flaggers they stand again from it this is the history of it I guess
[17:35.880 --> 17:42.880]  what do you expect Boston bombing total false flags with set up patsy's just

[18:00.920 --> 18:03.440]  searched everything we spent an hour yesterday going through every database
[18:03.440 --> 18:08.040]  of people that have ordered folks that have emailed us we searched all that
[18:08.040 --> 18:16.080]  stuff and and the supposed person that went and shot the people he's never
[18:16.080 --> 18:22.800]  trafficked with us so so he's had no truck with us as they say but I had AP
[18:22.800 --> 18:27.240]  calling me and every other thing you can imagine in the last few days you know

[24:19.240 --> 24:29.280]  so officially close to 200 top military commanders 111 in the Navy own only so
[24:29.280 --> 24:33.640]  it's well over 200 actually but the world that daily list has 200 top officers
[24:33.640 --> 24:38.560]  have been removed and and here's the big issue if they were removing them and
[24:38.560 --> 24:43.080]  giving reasons it would still be suspicious because it's the record
[24:43.080 --> 24:47.400]  number the Associated Press reported two weeks ago and Gucci already reported on
[24:47.400 --> 24:53.080]  it when they fired the top nuke commander when they fired the top nuke
[24:53.080 --> 24:59.120]  commander the Air Force Major General when they fired him and they fired his
[24:59.120 --> 25:04.000]  adjunct under him just a few weeks before and they then they also fired a top
[25:04.000 --> 25:08.760]  naval commander over the next an admiral AP said that the White House did not
[25:08.760 --> 25:13.320]  want it known he'd been fired and did not want the firings to be known and that
[25:13.320 --> 25:21.000]  had been leaked to them and talking to my high-level military sources most of
[25:21.000 --> 25:25.160]  them that won't come on a few of them have come on like Colonel Schaefer and
[25:25.160 --> 25:29.120]  then he gets reamed out because he's still connected to the Pentagon you know
[25:29.120 --> 25:33.280]  when he says too much and it's threatened to not come on this show but I've got a
[25:33.280 --> 25:43.720]  lot of others that won't come on the show and they are basically completely
[25:43.720 --> 25:48.640]  freaked out and just feel like the American people half of them are on
[25:48.640 --> 25:53.160]  welfare and they they know how collectivism works but let me break down
[25:53.160 --> 25:57.400]  how coups operate generally you generally have a soft coup at first
[25:57.400 --> 26:02.440]  we're an elected leader like Hitler or Obama gets elected Hitler gets elected
[26:02.440 --> 26:10.840]  1933 he then had a loyalty of and publicly for the entire German
[26:10.840 --> 26:17.280]  military the army the Luftwaffe the Navy and that's historical it's all on
[26:17.280 --> 26:23.920]  record and then hundreds of top generals and admirals and then sub officers were
[26:23.920 --> 26:29.360]  removed because they were not seen as loyal within about a month after that
[26:29.360 --> 26:34.280]  and then a few months after that there was the firebombing of the Reichstag and
[26:34.280 --> 26:39.200]  Hitler didn't go after his political enemies first he went after the SA
[26:39.200 --> 26:47.160]  which had been the street thugs and well it's a fact of homosexual cult under
[26:47.160 --> 26:52.000]  Ernst Rome that's the historical fact about they say about half the SA were
[26:52.000 --> 26:58.360]  were gay there's books written about it the pink swastika and that was the group
[26:58.360 --> 27:01.920]  they used to get control a lot of more former prisoners but also former
[27:01.920 --> 27:08.920]  highly decorated soldiers from World War one led by Ernst Rome and they killed
[27:08.920 --> 27:12.800]  them all in Night of the Long Knives Ernst Rome they took him into a jail
[27:12.800 --> 27:17.040]  cell the SS walked in and he screamed Hyal Hitler as they kept shooting him
[27:17.040 --> 27:21.200]  he flopped around on the ground saying I love you Adolf Hitler I love you my
[27:21.200 --> 27:24.680]  sweetie cake basically with blood spraying everywhere because Adolf Hitler was
[27:24.680 --> 27:28.960]  obviously bisexual and had a lot of fun with Ernst Rome so Adolf had his
[27:28.960 --> 27:33.400]  boyfriend killed that's on record by the way that came out the Nuremberg
[27:33.400 --> 27:38.640]  trials in 1967 they declassified the Hitler files in the British dossier the
[27:38.640 --> 27:43.480]  mind of Adolf Hitler show anyways let me just go back into how this works just
[27:43.480 --> 27:46.840]  using the Hitler model which is standard throughout history including Julius
[27:46.840 --> 27:50.840]  Caesar you name it first they come in and they have a soft coup and a loyalty
[27:50.840 --> 27:55.520]  deal and they assess who's doing what then they come out and they start you'll
[27:55.520 --> 28:01.120]  hear about suicides of top generals everywhere and people they've kicked
[28:01.120 --> 28:04.340]  out who they think might be able to organize a resistance and then they'll
[28:04.340 --> 28:08.640]  go after the talk show host and the Congress people and a lot of Congress
[28:08.640 --> 28:13.400]  folks will grovel and go along they're gonna be killed I'm not joking by the
[28:13.400 --> 28:17.600]  way in a matter of days they're gonna track people down and kill them of
[28:17.600 --> 28:20.400]  course the problem is everybody's armed everybody knows it's coming that's not
[28:20.400 --> 28:24.240]  gonna go too well through the DHS mercenaries they've hired in the big
[28:24.240 --> 28:28.080]  armored vehicles they've pre-deployed to go take out folks on a list because you
[28:28.080 --> 28:32.600]  may get the first wave of people then once you've attacked it becomes offense
[28:32.600 --> 28:37.680]  of defense strategy and all the special ops people say they're just gonna go
[28:37.680 --> 28:41.960]  after the tip of the spear the military and police trying this I don't mean
[28:41.960 --> 28:45.640]  what I'm not even gonna get into all this the point is anybody who knows
[28:45.640 --> 28:48.880]  about this kind of stuff knows what this is gonna look like and it is not gonna
[28:48.880 --> 28:53.720]  be pretty and I just want to be clear I'm political and I'm here covering what's
[28:53.720 --> 28:59.400]  going on as an American my country under the Bill of Rights Constitution but
[28:59.400 --> 29:03.360]  under the Geneva Convention has been usurped has been overthrown under
[29:03.360 --> 29:07.080]  Declaration of Independence I have full authorization to do whatever I want
[29:07.080 --> 29:11.120]  militarily but I'm not a military person I'm sure I could take care of a couple
[29:11.120 --> 29:15.600]  people but that's not what I do I'm in the Info War I will defend myself and my
[29:15.600 --> 29:19.560]  family from aggressors and that's my again right under common law common
[29:19.560 --> 29:25.240]  sense and US law but we are just getting down to the point ladies and
[29:25.240 --> 29:31.200]  gentlemen where this all has to be discussed because we are about to see
[29:31.200 --> 29:37.920]  and all the indicators are Obama is gonna try a red takeover and again a lot
[29:37.920 --> 29:40.440]  of people say oh no that's coming down the road it probably will come down the
[29:40.440 --> 29:44.360]  road we're probably gonna back them on but people need to know if we don't get
[29:44.360 --> 29:48.880]  real serious this is going to happen we'll be right back
[29:48.880 --> 29:58.160]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network

[33:25.600 --> 33:32.880]  right I haven't broken down how most slow motion coups take place historically
[33:32.880 --> 33:36.800]  the globalists don't want to have a third world coup where it's just overnight
[33:36.800 --> 33:41.480]  that's too obvious because after all we're such a free country but you're
[33:41.480 --> 33:44.880]  seeing a rollout against free speech the rollout against families the rollout

[34:11.360 --> 34:19.240]  converting us to their culture of no morals so we will accept being run over
[34:19.240 --> 34:25.800]  this is social engineering this is a plan and you've got well over 200 world
[34:25.800 --> 34:31.400]  not daily says 200 it's with well over 200 top military brass being purged and
[34:31.400 --> 34:37.560]  the big issue is they in most cases they won't say why and then they give them
[34:37.560 --> 34:43.240]  orders under national security to not say why and then I talked to high-level
[34:43.240 --> 34:47.160]  brass and they say no it's the litmus test will you do gun confiscation
[34:47.160 --> 34:50.080]  during a collapse and they're pre-deploying the troops they're training
[34:50.080 --> 34:52.920]  them for unprecedented riot control they're training on the tea parties
[34:52.920 --> 34:59.600]  their enemy that's in Forbes and AP I mean it's all there is my point it it
[34:59.600 --> 35:06.120]  dizzies my mind to try to think of all the public intel I mean it is more than
[35:06.120 --> 35:11.080]  100% documented you say well how can be more than a percent there's so many
[35:11.080 --> 35:16.680]  angles to it so many different plans within plans they've got there's like
[35:16.680 --> 35:21.800]  500 600% proof because there's different different battle plans and
[35:21.800 --> 35:26.160]  different variants and different stratas and different competing globalist
[35:26.160 --> 35:32.840]  groups and different operations we'd be like if a coach said I'm trying to get
[35:32.840 --> 35:35.440]  you outside one-dimensional thinking or two-dimensional thinking folks if you
[35:35.440 --> 35:38.920]  like a coach said yeah we've got one play in the playbook that's one
[35:38.920 --> 35:42.720]  dimensional they got a whole playbook of stuff and we've got all their different
[35:42.720 --> 35:46.360]  plans people say well that's just plans yeah these are unprecedented plans and
[35:46.360 --> 35:51.320]  the enemy isn't the Russians it isn't the Chinese Communist it isn't no it's
[35:51.320 --> 35:56.280]  the American people folks their own battle plans their own main mission
[35:56.280 --> 36:02.520]  statements in stars and stripes and army times and everywhere is that the
[36:02.520 --> 36:08.600]  American people are the enemy and now there is an unprecedented in 236 years
[36:08.600 --> 36:16.640]  of U.S. history gigant or purge of any one who is not seen as a total communist
[36:16.640 --> 36:22.040]  and they are putting absolute politicos in their place that are giant
[36:22.040 --> 36:25.800]  Democratic Party operatives on record and then they're putting them over all
[36:25.800 --> 36:30.360]  the federal agencies and they are massively increasing funding to DHS and
[36:30.360 --> 36:34.200]  its militarization as a fifth branch the military and you've got Marine Corps
[36:34.200 --> 36:39.040]  colonels going public who then got threatened when they talked to the
[36:39.040 --> 36:42.640]  city council so they haven't been heard from again I mean folks this is the real
[36:42.640 --> 36:46.280]  deal and I want to tell all the retired military people something you're not
[36:46.280 --> 36:50.360]  stupid you know this if we don't face this down right now politically and get
[36:50.360 --> 36:55.680]  really aggressive I mean banner hangs in your area pirate radio if it's needed
[36:55.680 --> 36:59.880]  go into public events taking over public events peacefully to make a big scene
[36:59.880 --> 37:05.480]  if men of leadership and women of leadership I can't do the leading
[37:05.480 --> 37:10.360]  around here okay I'm doing as much as I can it 40 years old I've been doing
[37:10.360 --> 37:14.440]  this fight 20 years 18 years on air I've got a lot of skills I don't have them
[37:14.440 --> 37:19.840]  all we I can't do this people aren't just gonna hear this by osmosis and then
[37:19.840 --> 37:23.760]  we're gonna get out of this we need the other talk show host this hit me this
[37:23.760 --> 37:28.000]  morning the last few years I've publicly said all the other big talk show
[37:28.000 --> 37:31.160]  host that attacked me and stuff I'm not in competition with you I'm in
[37:31.160 --> 37:34.560]  competition with tyranny I want to restore the Republic I don't want to be
[37:34.560 --> 37:39.560]  a slave this is really scary please the new orders real the FEMA camps are real
[37:39.560 --> 37:44.360]  the plans are real here's the evidence I sent it to folks like Limbaugh Beck
[37:44.360 --> 37:48.080]  packages of info and I haven't talked to them but I've talked to some of their
[37:48.080 --> 37:51.880]  people off and on and they now are freaked out and know it's all true so
[37:51.880 --> 37:57.080]  that's good but but we need to get the so-called liberals to wake up who who
[37:57.080 --> 38:00.960]  aren't evil and who've been conned and admit you've been conned listen this is
[38:00.960 --> 38:07.360]  not gonna be good for anybody and I'm not up here taking credit saying look
[38:07.360 --> 38:11.360]  what we've done I'm just a guy from Texas that learned about tyranny got
[38:11.360 --> 38:16.200]  upset about it and started fighting it and that example is you can do a lot
[38:16.200 --> 38:22.000]  more than I've done especially former military generals especially doctors
[38:22.000 --> 38:27.120]  that have been the heads of societies lawyers that are prominent journalists
[38:27.120 --> 38:33.680]  that have been prominent in anybody a pastors it's time to understand there's
[38:33.680 --> 38:40.000]  a foreign globalist takeover and we need to mobilize in free speech and expose
[38:40.000 --> 38:45.680]  the tyranny and say we need a bill of rights culture again and anything against
[38:45.680 --> 38:49.040]  that whether it's Democrat or Republican is the enemy we need to come
[38:49.040 --> 38:52.160]  together and they're gonna go racist racist racist just to change the subject
[38:52.160 --> 38:55.280]  to go I'm not a racist even though there's nothing to do with it it's meant
[38:55.280 --> 38:57.600]  to just get you to change the subject you just say you're trying to create
[38:57.600 --> 39:00.320]  division let's come together everybody can feel it
[39:00.320 --> 39:04.400]  Obama's losing about five points a week right now and here's why I'm so worried
[39:04.400 --> 39:09.160]  let me tell you how the coups work generally in a major civilization not a
[39:09.160 --> 39:13.720]  third-world country we don't really have flash coups here but at the end it
[39:13.720 --> 39:18.200]  becomes a flash coup they do a litmus test with the military kick a bunch of
[39:18.200 --> 39:24.520]  people out then they stage some big terror attacker event and a bunch of top
[39:24.520 --> 39:28.840]  generals suddenly get killed them and you hear oh yeah the general died or he
[39:28.840 --> 39:31.600]  got shot in the chest he committed suicide or he got run over and you go
[39:31.600 --> 39:35.960]  there's like 20 of them in one day and then and then they'll kill like 20 or so
[39:35.960 --> 39:39.520]  just see what happens and then if people don't freak out and go out in the
[39:39.520 --> 39:45.000]  streets then speaking out then they kill 500 and then oh well there were some
[39:45.000 --> 39:49.080]  arrests made there were some people planning terror attacks and then a nuke
[39:49.080 --> 39:53.280]  goes off or a bio weapon gets released and everybody's panicking and yeah it
[39:53.280 --> 39:57.120]  was the right-wing alliance with al-qaeda and you're like that makes no
[39:57.120 --> 40:00.760]  sense the the right wing in this country's a little is is islamophobic as
[40:00.760 --> 40:04.760]  it said totally and it doesn't matter all the Pentagon public training is that
[40:04.760 --> 40:07.640]  the Tea Party is gonna merge with al-qaeda and you're like that doesn't make
[40:07.640 --> 40:14.400]  sense you know Obama supporters will absolutely buy it okay if we haven't
[40:14.400 --> 40:18.600]  gotten to them first and explain how this works to them because they'll be so
[40:18.600 --> 40:23.400]  scared when a major city's got a smoking low-yield nuke go off in it or a bio
[40:23.400 --> 40:27.840]  weapon or a chem weapons release I'm telling you the script they operate like
[40:27.840 --> 40:31.280]  everybody's brain dead so the scripting and the pre-programming on something
[40:31.280 --> 40:36.680]  this big is like a d-day invasion or a rollout okay I mean it's but it's an
[40:36.680 --> 40:41.360]  invasion against liberty and so the rollouts there we just don't know when
[40:41.360 --> 40:48.000]  the attacks coming okay I mean we're having drills the Tea Party's gonna
[40:48.000 --> 40:52.720]  come shoot people in the line and you saw it on the news to get weak-minded
[40:52.720 --> 40:57.480]  people to think about that and implant that if they implant that in 315 million
[40:57.480 --> 41:01.520]  people will a mentally ill person go shoot up see that's one way they can
[41:01.520 --> 41:05.920]  false flag is mind control the public is so highly suggestible you put that
[41:05.920 --> 41:09.120]  movies TV shows everywhere the last six months that the Tea Party is gonna go
[41:09.120 --> 41:14.920]  shoot up TSA and now whether they staged it in a drill and killed some
[41:14.920 --> 41:19.320]  innocent guy and had a shooter up in the you know up in the up in the ceiling
[41:19.320 --> 41:22.280]  tiles you know shooting people I mean that's how they can do it I'm just
[41:22.280 --> 41:25.840]  speculating how they could do that from past operations we've exposed and
[41:25.840 --> 41:31.080]  reverse engineered or they they just put out somebody's gonna shoot TSA and
[41:31.080 --> 41:35.560]  then a weak-minded person gets the suggestion put in their mind and goes
[41:35.560 --> 41:40.600]  and does it or it's a low chance people are mad by the tyranny and wrongfully
[41:40.600 --> 41:46.360]  went and did this you you push people you push the wrong people they're gonna
[41:46.360 --> 41:50.000]  push back that's why they're given the cops orders that are meant to make the
[41:50.000 --> 41:54.360]  public push back because if you are a globalist offshore banks that finance
[41:54.360 --> 41:59.000]  the Bolshevik Revolution to take that over the ultra-rich financing Bolshevik
[41:59.000 --> 42:03.240]  takeovers how would you take down America exactly as they're doing it this
[42:03.240 --> 42:09.440]  is the only way get the public dependent divide and conquer them start a purge
[42:09.440 --> 42:15.080]  of the military a soft purge ahead of the false flag blamed on libertarians
[42:15.080 --> 42:19.240]  conservatives gun owners anybody that you know doesn't like the foreign takeover
[42:19.240 --> 42:23.560]  the banks read any southern property law center ADL demonization list that's
[42:23.560 --> 42:28.720]  their enemy that's who they're gonna come after and you'll also see the
[42:28.720 --> 42:33.060]  southern property law center ADL and others right before they do this guaranteed
[42:33.060 --> 42:36.520]  everybody who lives around these installations you need to be watching
[42:36.520 --> 42:40.560]  them if they all pull out and the parking lots are empty on a weekday and
[42:40.560 --> 42:44.520]  it's not a holiday and the cars are gone a few days they've all gone to Europe or
[42:44.520 --> 42:48.080]  something to sit this out that's another deal because they're expecting those
[42:48.080 --> 42:53.640]  installations to get hit I'm telling you folks this is a war okay you are in a
[42:53.640 --> 42:58.640]  war right now you are living in the attempted takedown of America they've
[42:58.640 --> 43:01.840]  already used us to build the global empire to set up the corporate new
[43:01.840 --> 43:05.880]  world order they've already got us to the bankruptcy point they deindustrialize
[43:05.880 --> 43:10.440]  us they're shutting our power plants off the student loan bubbles about the
[43:10.440 --> 43:15.000]  bust the real estate markets about the bus the commercial real estate market
[43:15.000 --> 43:20.240]  is about to bust mainstream news CNBC's reporting rich families are leaving the
[43:20.240 --> 43:23.920]  US hoarding cash I forgot to play that yesterday give me that video please I
[43:23.920 --> 43:28.280]  mean it's all there thousands of data points and then you get the manuals and
[43:28.280 --> 43:32.120]  it's a hundred percent for war with us it's usually it's not me telling you
[43:32.120 --> 43:37.480]  this is my opinion we have got people that absolutely hate us anybody who loves
[43:37.480 --> 43:41.560]  freedom anybody who's Christian anybody who's a gun owner anybody who's got
[43:41.560 --> 43:45.400]  property wouldn't part of the mafia global system we are the enemy folks
[43:45.400 --> 43:49.040]  they want to crush this country once and for all and they will crush the
[43:49.040 --> 43:52.280]  military and police they keep saying foreign troops are going to be used no
[43:52.280 --> 43:58.000]  that's later they've got mercenaries on record they're deploying with top secret
[43:58.000 --> 44:03.200]  security clearances by the thousands in each state armored vehicles tanks weapons
[44:03.200 --> 44:08.240]  flamethrowers missile launchers drones they've got the military has over 50
[44:08.240 --> 44:14.280]  thousand drones 25,000 of them are sitting there waiting with with strike
[44:14.280 --> 44:18.360]  points prepared for this civil war didn't scare me because they're not going
[44:18.360 --> 44:22.880]  to be able to stop anybody but the whole point is they can't even hold Iraq or
[44:22.880 --> 44:27.000]  Afghanistan with these things so the whole point is though is that I mean
[44:27.000 --> 44:32.160]  they really are looking for this so you have a soft coup over the general start
[44:32.160 --> 44:35.560]  removing the ones you're really worried about then the stage the false flag of
[44:35.560 --> 44:42.480]  the crisis then wipe out your opposition in a week or so stage more events pose
[44:42.480 --> 44:49.280]  that you're gonna save everybody if you do what the state-run media says then
[44:49.280 --> 44:52.560]  they move into the next phase probably start some new military war some
[44:52.560 --> 44:56.600]  conflict overseas to to get us to be patriotic do what you said because you
[44:56.600 --> 44:59.280]  know the Tea Party struck with Al Qaeda at the same time when we're fighting them
[44:59.280 --> 45:02.320]  overseas and it won't matter if they're attacking Shiites or the opposite of Al
[45:02.320 --> 45:05.560]  Qaeda they'll just say it's Al Qaeda I mean that's how they operate and then
[45:05.560 --> 45:09.120]  those other key data point I was gonna go through so so as all this unwinds then
[45:09.120 --> 45:13.640]  the military and police they find out who's who we all kill each other in a
[45:13.640 --> 45:18.280]  two-three-year civil war Obama's the new Abraham Lincoln it's all been tested all
[45:18.280 --> 45:21.960]  been put out I told you six years ago he'll be the new Abraham Lincoln I could
[45:21.960 --> 45:26.480]  see that iconography I could see the archetype I could see the programming and
[45:26.480 --> 45:31.120]  now ladies and gentlemen you notice they're saying well if you want to
[45:31.120 --> 45:33.840]  nullify stuff if you don't want to do Obamacare if you want to do is we'll
[45:33.840 --> 45:38.560]  just march troops in well you know if you don't if Texas bans the TSA we'll
[45:38.560 --> 45:43.200]  just put f-16s in the air and f-18s to force down all aircraft it's already
[45:43.200 --> 45:48.480]  there and and look at all the other bold stuff they've done it can happen here it
[45:48.480 --> 45:52.480]  is happening here now here here's the goodness well let me finish this I'll
[45:52.480 --> 45:56.440]  get the goodness we all kill each other in civil war wipe things out
[45:56.440 --> 46:00.040]  everybody's just tired of it wants it to end and then they bring in the
[46:00.040 --> 46:05.240]  international stabilization force oh my gosh and first will be European troops
[46:05.240 --> 46:08.480]  that with folks that are historically more allied with not just because they're
[46:08.480 --> 46:12.360]  European but because we think of you know Europeans as being pro-america it's
[46:12.360 --> 46:15.640]  going to be British it's going to be Dutch it's going to be German it's going
[46:15.640 --> 46:18.800]  to be Australian a mate because I've been to these drills where they practice
[46:18.800 --> 46:24.080]  occupying San Francisco and occupying Alabama now and in its foreign troops
[46:24.080 --> 46:28.360]  training to take over our neighborhoods with the Marines that have been
[46:28.360 --> 46:33.240]  questioned and will follow the orders so it's foreign groups foreign platoons and
[46:33.240 --> 46:40.480]  then brigade level after that led by Marines led by army led by military
[46:40.480 --> 46:45.560]  police and led by mercenaries and FBI squads and ATF squads just like you saw
[46:45.560 --> 46:50.960]  in Katrina all broken up in different squads mopping up but but they're going
[46:50.960 --> 46:55.160]  to first have the police and military get wiped out in a civil war with gun
[46:55.160 --> 46:59.040]  owners and I don't know what you do when they come to take your guns I mean I'm
[46:59.040 --> 47:02.840]  more and more think you bury most your weapons you turn in what they want
[47:02.840 --> 47:08.160]  there's not to kill a bunch of cops in military and I'm not saying turn your
[47:08.160 --> 47:11.000]  guns in I'm just really trying to think how the civil war doesn't happen but
[47:11.000 --> 47:14.200]  then they're gonna try to take in an interrogation take your family and it's
[47:14.200 --> 47:17.360]  just it's all I mean you can't help it you try to avoid them you try to wake
[47:17.360 --> 47:20.960]  them up now I mean you better be talking to police and military right now
[47:20.960 --> 47:25.520]  before we've got it before the Obama orders them to march in against us this
[47:25.520 --> 47:29.400]  is so horrible and then they're gonna sit up there and laugh and eat popcorn in
[47:29.400 --> 47:34.400]  Europe and and and overseas while all this is going on this is so funny to the
[47:34.400 --> 47:39.360]  New World Order what they're doing right now by the way it's like a six minute
[47:39.360 --> 47:41.720]  clip or whatever we're not gonna have time to air it all but you know the news
[47:41.720 --> 47:44.560]  said I am making it up that there's a New World Order and that's a corporate
[47:44.560 --> 47:47.640]  world government even though they brag that's happening here's a few clips of
[47:47.640 --> 47:51.080]  world leaders talking about a New World Order but if I talk about it and some
[47:51.080 --> 47:56.080]  guy that's future TSA agent allegedly has this in his bag it's my fault and now
[47:56.080 --> 48:00.800]  Ron Paul's fault as well here it is we have before us the opportunity to forge
[48:00.800 --> 48:07.480]  for ourselves and for future generations a New World Order a world for the rule
[48:07.480 --> 48:12.480]  of law not the law of the jungle governs the Congress is actually the law of the
[48:12.480 --> 48:16.400]  jungle they have over us when we are success and we will be and we will be
[48:16.400 --> 48:22.000]  we have a real chance at this New World Order an order in which a credible
[48:22.000 --> 48:27.640]  United Nations can use its peacekeeping role to fulfill the promise and vision
[48:27.640 --> 48:33.080]  by the way they've just invaded Central Africa is a big idea in offense a New
[48:33.080 --> 48:38.240]  World Order a world in which there is the very real process but it's okay
[48:38.240 --> 48:44.160]  because Obama's black after 1989 President Bush said and it's a phrase
[48:44.160 --> 48:49.200]  that I often use myself that we needed a New World Order there is a chance the
[48:49.200 --> 48:54.840]  president the United States to use this disaster to carry out what his father a
[48:54.840 --> 48:59.640]  phrase his father used I think only once and hasn't been used since and that is
[48:59.640 --> 49:02.280]  a New World Order so that the problem of the Bush
[49:02.280 --> 49:08.560]  presidency will be the emergence of a new international order within the next
[49:08.560 --> 49:12.640]  four years we will see the emergence of a new international order the beginning
[49:12.640 --> 49:16.680]  that's already happened world currency being announced the pieces are in flux
[49:16.680 --> 49:22.960]  SDR right now settle again before they do the Chinese yarn it's let us reach
[49:22.960 --> 49:29.000]  center this world around us I think its task will be to develop an overall
[49:29.000 --> 49:34.920]  strategy for America in this period when really a New World Order can be created
[49:34.920 --> 49:41.840]  that's kissing you're on Obama it's about the future of Europe and a new
[49:41.840 --> 49:47.480]  world order there's a need for a new world order but it has different
[49:47.480 --> 49:54.360]  characteristics in different parts of the world all we've got to do today with
[49:54.360 --> 50:00.560]  Asia already is realized India and China are clearly becoming part that we are
[50:00.560 --> 50:07.880]  under attack order we are now facing a common challenge and the challenge is
[50:07.880 --> 50:16.560]  how to build a world order for the first time in history total global on a
[50:16.560 --> 50:24.080]  global basis so in conclusion ladies and gentlemen a new world is emerging it is a
[50:24.080 --> 50:30.040]  new world order with significantly different and radically new challenges
[50:30.040 --> 50:33.720]  the end of the family the end of everything task we have now break
[50:33.720 --> 50:41.600]  yourselves is to actually create a new world order enemy operations are now
[50:41.600 --> 50:47.160]  going into high gear and British Prime Minister Gordon today at level folks they
[50:47.160 --> 50:52.280]  are not playing games global economic crisis we're gonna be right back like
[50:52.280 --> 50:56.760]  this vision of a new world order but again none of this exists there is no

[54:25.680 --> 54:29.660]  it's hard to get into anything else when you know there really is a military
[54:29.660 --> 54:33.200]  coup going on and when you studied history and then you see their own
[54:33.200 --> 54:38.840]  manuals just just watching it from afar you know we're in trouble but when you
[54:38.840 --> 54:43.000]  actually look into then the training and then it's not even hidden no wonder
[54:43.000 --> 54:47.320]  the military's freaking out and it seems only be the military that is really
[54:47.320 --> 54:52.360]  freaking out about this so I will open the phones up in the third hour today
[54:52.360 --> 54:56.000]  so you've got other guests and breaking news coming up in the next hour for
[54:56.000 --> 55:02.080]  active-duty military and police because now it's reached a crescendo of debate
[55:02.080 --> 55:05.720]  under the new training the state police you know spoken out in places like
[55:05.720 --> 55:09.480]  Colorado when they tell them you may have to take guns from all Christians and
[55:09.480 --> 55:13.000]  then state police you came out six months ago they get ready to get out of
[55:13.000 --> 55:18.760]  their chairs going is this a joke what they're like no it's not a joke now sit
[55:18.760 --> 55:25.440]  down or give me your resignation I mean right there that's authoritarianism
[55:25.440 --> 55:30.600]  that's that's that's Soviet Union ladies and gentlemen I mean that's the thing
[55:30.600 --> 55:34.600]  is that it's light years I had anything I can imagine you know that family in
[55:34.600 --> 55:38.480]  in Colorado where their their daughter and other girls there was a guy in there
[55:38.480 --> 55:44.040]  looking at him to the bathroom stalls who said that he was you know transgender
[55:44.040 --> 55:47.880]  or whatever and the point is it's just a way for people in many cases that want
[55:47.880 --> 55:52.200]  to push folks around to dominate now the police told them we're watching you and
[55:52.200 --> 55:57.040]  we might arrest you for hate and now Swedish cinemas take aim at gender bias
[55:57.040 --> 56:02.720]  with a new test to make sure that it promotes feminism and see soon you
[56:02.720 --> 56:06.320]  won't be able to get on the air this is their plan unless you promote what they
[56:06.320 --> 56:09.960]  want in Europe they're making it illegal to criticize their brand of
[56:09.960 --> 56:14.840]  feminism which means women running everything with the state is their man
[56:14.840 --> 56:21.040]  which is the slave model oh yeah the house slaves in Rome and right here in
[56:21.040 --> 56:28.280]  the south were women women running things and they were the foreman you know
[56:28.280 --> 56:31.240]  you never see that in all these fake movies like roots and stuff you know
[56:31.240 --> 56:37.680]  who actually was cracking the whip about a 350 pound woman that's a fact black
[56:37.680 --> 56:42.160]  woman that's who's out there with that whip get that work done right now that's
[56:42.160 --> 56:48.240]  your feminism right there baby the Romans had that don't think that came from
[56:48.240 --> 56:53.680]  just invented for black folks you'll gonna learn though everybody's gonna
[56:53.680 --> 57:02.240]  learn real good how all this really works when my dad picked cotton when he
[57:02.240 --> 57:06.880]  was a kid and his parents will send him over to neighboring farm to do it it was
[57:06.880 --> 57:10.520]  white people and black people picking cotton and do you know who all the
[57:10.520 --> 57:16.960]  foreman were 350 pound black women all right I'm done I'm gonna leave it right
[57:16.960 --> 57:24.040]  there okay let's continue ladies and gentlemen we've got this big news on
[57:24.040 --> 57:28.960]  Fukushima coming up this is with the physicist and scientist David Suzuki
[57:28.960 --> 57:31.920]  we're gonna break this down coming up let's go ahead and go out with this
[57:31.920 --> 57:39.080]  clip three of the four plants were destroyed in the in the earthquake in
[57:39.080 --> 57:46.960]  the tsunami the fourth one has been so badly damaged that the fear is there's
[57:46.960 --> 57:53.240]  another earthquake of a seven or above that that building will go and then all
[57:53.240 --> 57:58.520]  hell breaks loose and the probability of a seven or above earthquake in the next
[57:58.520 --> 58:04.360]  three years is over 95 percent now what they've got in there is 1300 rods of
[58:04.360 --> 58:09.680]  spent fuel that have to be kept in water all the time and they have no way of
[58:09.680 --> 58:14.000]  getting it out and as you know they're pouring water in that water's leaking up
[58:14.000 --> 58:18.920]  and now they've got this cock a baby scheme of trying to freeze the soil so
[58:18.920 --> 58:24.120]  it'll form a frozen wall they don't know what to do and the thing we need is to
[58:24.120 --> 58:30.560]  get an international group of experts to go in with complete freedom to do what
[58:30.560 --> 58:34.800]  they suggest and right now the Japanese government we're gonna come back to with
[58:34.800 --> 58:39.280]  the rest of this in the second hour please stay with us

[01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:42.560]  linked two days ago to a russia today article about this but now this is
[01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:46.760]  starting to get picked up and is becoming big news I'm not saying this is
[01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:53.120]  going to happen but it is in the cards in fact it's not even a a remote
[01:00:53.120 --> 01:01:00.080]  possibility it is a possibility though I wouldn't say probable for my own
[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:03.960]  research but you can decide for yourself the articles up on info wars dot com
[01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:08.720]  we're gonna have Anthony Gucci already joining us and we should already show
[01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:15.400]  folks a NOAA radiation map this is put out by the federal government's
[01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:21.320]  national oceanic administration or I forget what NOAA stands for national
[01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:26.240]  oceanic and aeronautical what does it stand for it'll pop my head but you
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:29.440]  know that's the National Weather Service and that's what their real name is but
[01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:34.480]  they call it they call the National Weather Service but it's NOAA and we
[01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:41.240]  have this radiation map that we can also add to Gucci Arties article that
[01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:48.160]  shows already with the five of the six reactors that leaked and some of them
[01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:55.880]  exploded already the radiation increasing across the world particularly in
[01:01:55.880 --> 01:02:01.520]  the northern hemisphere and the government the media does not tell you to
[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:05.800]  get good iodine they do not tell you to protect yourself they don't tell you to
[01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:10.200]  go get Himalayan salts and have it in your food which helps protect the
[01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:15.600]  thyroid they sure don't tell you that a leech we had a man I'm not allowed to
[01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:22.480]  say who we had a major major cosmetics company buy masses of this and they want
[01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:27.520]  to buy as much as we can sell them the survival shield I wasn't meaning to
[01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:33.320]  plug this now but might as well the special proprietary nascent iodine
[01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:37.320]  that's produced electricity and other technologies I'm not gonna I'm not allowed
[01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:41.920]  to get into it all but you see this is half empty because I take it this is my
[01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:46.880]  personal bottle of the nascent survival shield dietary supplement that all the
[01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:49.880]  experts that we've had on the doctors the medical doctors the scientists the
[01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:54.920]  nutritionists you know said this is this is the big secret product right here so
[01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:58.560]  I started taking it for a few months and was just blown away by it so I've now
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:02.400]  popularized this now I went again we ran out of it tried to find other suppliers
[01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:07.680]  and it was not really nascent iodine it was terrible tasting and and groups said
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:11.520]  look that's why I developed this 20 years ago 20 years ago with these Russians
[01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:16.320]  at a lab that's been there for 40 years a very small lab by the way I mean it's
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:21.480]  medium-sized but compared to a lot of big ones and I rolled it out and people
[01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:25.280]  getting it have been giving me nothing but stellar reviews I might just plug now
[01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:29.600]  I didn't plug anything last hour it's how we fund ourselves as well we just got
[01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:33.480]  in a massive load of this last week another huge load showing up today that
[01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:37.880]  will cover the back order we've got for about a week and we'll give us enough at
[01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:41.520]  the current sales rate for another week and then it'll be back ordered for about
[01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:45.480]  three weeks again so ladies and gentlemen if you want the survival

[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:55.880]  else has that's listed the National Institutes of Health as being an
[01:03:55.880 --> 01:04:02.120]  original proprietary system that we have a lot of elites buying from us because I
[01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:04.920]  learned the elite was already on this stuff that's why and I did a lot of
[01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:07.520]  research if I'm gonna come out with vitamins and minerals and stuff what is
[01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:10.840]  the best and I have other people on like pharmacist Ben Fuchs that doesn't
[01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:15.080]  even isn't involved in this he goes yes it's incredible oh my gosh because it is

[01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:04.920]  Alex Jones here and I want to tell you about a long time friend of the show my
[01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:09.280]  patreon supply as you might remember this is the company that stood up to the

[01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:41.000]  scientists another Fukushima quake would mean US evacuation by by Japan those
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:45.080]  are quotes by the way actually there won't be evacuation no matter how high
[01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:50.280]  the radiation is they'll tell you it's fine serial liar video of Obama blatantly
[01:08:50.280 --> 01:08:56.360]  lying 36 times I want to play that this is a compilation later DHS publicly
[01:08:56.360 --> 01:09:03.800]  denies preparation for riot civil unrest that is so huge their own Fed dot biz
[01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:12.360]  gov website has literally hundreds of solicitations a month that says for
[01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:17.080]  civil unrest riots and it's all over local newspapers around the country we
[01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:21.040]  covered it where the military and police admit they've been ordered to get ready
[01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:25.240]  for it I mean I could open the phones up right now and have unlimited police and
[01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:29.560]  military call in and say no we've been told get ready for imminent unrest now
[01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:32.480]  I don't know if that's gonna happen when they cut back on some of the welfare
[01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:35.360]  and food stamps because they want to pay all that money to foreign banks and
[01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:40.520]  Obama's got got reelected he's got got you now he's in a double triple your
[01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:44.160]  rates not give you free health care and then promise that if you just keep you
[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:47.120]  know doing what he says you'll get something free someday that's the plan
[01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:53.080]  but that is so huge but again why shouldn't they lie we're the enemy they
[01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:57.200]  lie and say there's no new world order no corporate global government anyone
[01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:00.960]  that says it is racist and then all these world leaders on C-span are
[01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:04.680]  constantly calling for a corporate private world government that ends the
[01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:09.760]  family and basically turns us into like slaves it's so incredible they just go
[01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:13.800]  there's no world government there's no mercury in your shot fluoride's good for
[01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:19.600]  you cancer rates aren't up even though they're 3,000% plus everything's fine

[01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:35.720]  it's and then you find the white papers where they did it on purpose John P.
[01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:43.760]  Holdren it's so funny to them so incredibly funny that all of this is
[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:50.960]  going on now continuing ladies and gentlemen with the news here top
[01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:57.520]  scientists another Fukushima quake would mean US evacuation bye bye Japan
[01:10:57.520 --> 01:11:04.840]  a serial liar video of Obama blatantly lying 36 times DHS publicly denies
[01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:10.800]  preparation for riot civil unrest man I'd say that's a big that's a good one
[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:14.440]  kind of like Obama saying two days ago I never said we would knock you off your
[01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:20.720]  insurance that's preposterous bunch of racist liars info wars announces we
[01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:29.400]  will resist TSA and NSA tyranny 10k film contest Democrat win in Virginia

[01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:44.320]  they're gonna have it because they well they know how to run a commie takeover
[01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:49.080]  don't they continuing families threatened with police monitoring over
[01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:57.440]  transgender complaints yeah you don't like men going in the women's and men's
[01:11:57.440 --> 01:12:02.840]  bathroom and again I've experienced this and I'm a pretty you know guy that
[01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:06.640]  into shrieking violent I've told the story before I'm not gonna get into it
[01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:12.040]  again but there was a famous transvestite not transgender who was just a
[01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:17.480]  just a singularly horrible person that was like some kind of monster out of a
[01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:21.600]  movie who would wear thongs up and down the streets he had a TV show for a year
[01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:25.440]  at the access TV and I had to be around it and it wasn't they were cheerleader
[01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:29.840]  outfits that that was disgusting it was that he would have you know feces
[01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:34.000]  dribbling down his leg and stuff and and he would go in the women men's and
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:37.400]  women's bathroom and hang out because it's like that's what they're into is
[01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:40.520]  being in different bathrooms you'd have church groups and stuff there and
[01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:43.960]  people little kids would be freaked out with a ball-headed guy with like long
[01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:47.280]  hair on the sides and a cheerleader outfit you know what's with his buddies
[01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:51.640]  in there using drugs and then vomiting everywhere and they finally kicked them
[01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:55.320]  out and it was like oh my gosh we might come after you for being me
[01:12:55.320 --> 01:13:00.600]  and we've even had like newspapers and stuff call us up and say oh are you
[01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:03.600]  talking about about the icon we're gonna build it and it's like it's okay
[01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:09.240]  whatever I mean get get rumpel still skin in a dress and it's still rumpel
[01:13:09.240 --> 01:13:14.640]  still skin and and and you know that's the issue here is that is that you'd
[01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:17.200]  walk into the bathroom I'd walk in there like once to comb my hair and put a
[01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:22.800]  sports jacket on you didn't have changing rooms in there and and there
[01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:32.240]  he'd be lounging looking at me and then yeah I'm nothing much and I go over and
[01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:35.920]  sit there at the urinal while him and his buddy were staring at me and I just
[01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:39.120]  whatever lost my hands walk out but let me tell you the church groups they
[01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:44.200]  didn't like it you know the passing out in the bathroom and the vomiting
[01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:53.400]  everywhere and anyways why did I just go off into that it's just like it's like yeah
[01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:56.560]  yeah they have transgender bathrooms not just in California it's in Colorado
[01:13:56.560 --> 01:14:01.400]  it's everywhere now and again if they can get away with that they can do
[01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:05.480]  anything ladies and gentlemen and then they're like we hate you now we don't
[01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:11.920]  want Ender's game to come out is a movie because the writer isn't for gay
[01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:16.840]  marriage well even if you disagree with him don't try to shut down his art I
[01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:21.240]  mean these people are authoritarians ladies and gentlemen and they're not
[01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:25.560]  gonna stop and they make their their civil rights movement about things like
[01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:29.320]  that because everybody's gonna lose their privacy everybody's gonna lose their
[01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:33.600]  their money their private property their future they're making war upon the
[01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:37.920]  family but they have to have the high ground and say we're gonna do all this
[01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:43.320]  to you because you haven't accepted our lifestyle you must adopt it you must
[01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:46.680]  adopt euthanasia now we're gonna tell your kids if they want to commit
[01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:50.120]  suicide they can for the earth will arrest you if you try to stop jenny
[01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:53.160]  kill yourself for the bunny rabbits I mean this is actually going on in
[01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:57.360]  northern Europe this is a scientific program in the major university studies
[01:14:57.360 --> 01:15:01.560]  we cover it in game 2.0 the university studies where they admitted that the
[01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:08.640]  plan to annihilate society this is a plan ladies and gentlemen this is a program
[01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:12.480]  coming up we've got Anthony Gutiarty coming in about this amazing clip I
[01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:17.800]  want to cue it back up and play it in a moment by David Suzuki top scientist
[01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:24.000]  another Fukushima quake would mean US evacuation bye bye Japan award-winning
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:29.200]  scientist David Suzuki has gone on record in a public talk posted online just
[01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:33.840]  days ago and saying in the event of another seven or above earthquake which
[01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:37.400]  he says has about a 95% chance of occurring over the next three years
[01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:40.920]  that's what the seismologists are saying it's on the most active volcanic
[01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:45.400]  region in the world very smart to build the reactors there in a tsunami zone as
[01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:51.440]  well it would mean a complete evacuation with America and bye bye Japan and here
[01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:57.560]  is that if in fact the fourth plan goes under an earthquake and those rods are
[01:15:57.560 --> 01:16:04.520]  exposed it's by by Japan and everybody on the west coast of North America should
[01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:13.040]  evacuate that isn't terrifying I don't know what is and again ladies and
[01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:18.040]  gentlemen I was brought up pretty conservative liberal on some issues but
[01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:22.000]  I was brought up nuclear power is the greatest thing since since Christmas I
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:26.920]  mean it is just wonderful it's clean it's safe it's great my dad is even
[01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:30.840]  against it now because they won't run it properly they build them in the wrong
[01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:36.560]  spots they dump the waste wherever they want they hide disasters and now the
[01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:40.520]  number of disasters is off the chart because all over the country they've
[01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:44.840]  turned off the alarms that you hear of the sirens starting a few years ago in
[01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:49.000]  San Diego when it was scaring folks when it was going off all the time they
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:54.960]  said you know what we're just not going to turn that alarm on anymore just like
[01:16:54.960 --> 01:17:00.880]  until 1990 they wouldn't let US troops use DU that they had as a weapon system
[01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:05.280]  since 1946 I've adopted Doug Rocky head of the DU Pentagon program on about it
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:10.360]  and no one would let them use it because they said well it's a death sentence
[01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:13.600]  it ignites going out the barrel it's an incredible weapon but whoever breathes
[01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:17.120]  it if you breathe just a little bit of this it's going to reduce your lifespan
[01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:21.360]  gonna burn out your kidneys where precipitates out in your lungs this is a
[01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:28.040]  death sentence and in 1990 they went you know what use it and now Israel uses it
[01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:33.480]  firing into Gaza and the winds prevailing right off the Mediterranean
[01:17:33.480 --> 01:17:40.440]  blow right in I mean that's a valuable land even if Israel wants to take the
[01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:44.640]  Gaza Strip or something let's just say from a purely Zionist perspective if
[01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:48.440]  Israel wanted to take I mean why would you because it's just again it's a
[01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:51.880]  madness and the Germans don't care if it's leaking the French don't care the
[01:17:51.880 --> 01:17:58.080]  Japanese don't care Israel doesn't care the US doesn't care it's crazy land you
[01:17:58.080 --> 01:18:04.200]  know who won't use DU up until now is the Russians and the Chinese I mean why
[01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:07.160]  would you use something it's a death sentence to your troops and now under
[01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:10.160]  pressure because they need it to fight back there's an arms race they're now
[01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:17.760]  starting to manufacture it the Chinese and the Russians because suddenly it's
[01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:21.480]  like well let's just suspend the rules of physics and suspend the rules of
[01:18:21.480 --> 01:18:24.920]  science and medicine and let's just say DU is safe I mean that's what I'm
[01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:30.000]  talking about folks there's 420 something reactors 91% of them are leaking
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:34.480]  you can pull up those numbers that's the atomic energy agency from the test
[01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:39.320]  they're leaking they're rotting their average age is 37 years old they're
[01:18:39.320 --> 01:18:43.680]  supposed to be retired after 30 they are disaster zones do you know what
[01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:50.120]  radiation does to those buildings you want the heat oh my gosh ladies and
[01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:54.320]  gentlemen ladies and gentlemen this is collective madness and we come back a
[01:18:54.320 --> 01:19:04.520]  bunch of the other news the new mayor of New York City is a socialist on record
[01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:10.000]  three gun companies are now leaving New York because of the state laws basically
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:17.800]  restricting them New Jersey holds a turn yourself in program for fugitives and it
[01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:22.400]  goes on and on and on report we covered this yesterday but now it's up on

[01:24:35.720 --> 01:24:40.840]  drugsreport.com right in the middle of the article we're also gonna get it
[01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:45.440]  posted up at MFallWars.com it's from the Daily Caller
[01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:51.920]  Sebelius is back in the hot seat right now she says delay is not an option even
[01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:55.320]  though that was the plan the whole time and then there's the video admits
[01:24:55.320 --> 01:25:03.080]  felons can become navigators we told you this a couple months ago that they
[01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:09.680]  were hiring a bunch of acorn type groups with criminal records to run this
[01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:13.320]  well that's what the Democratic Party is is a street-level mafia group run by
[01:25:13.320 --> 01:25:18.880]  foreign banks and of course they're going to loot and steal the money and
[01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:23.040]  get your social security numbers that's what the Obamacare website is for is to
[01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:26.920]  find out who doesn't have the health care so they can take your tax return
[01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:31.360]  your tax refund and now they admit that by the way that's what the bill says
[01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:34.880]  that's how they're gonna get it and they're gonna garnish your bank account
[01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:42.720]  and they're going to also a fine you so so there's your free health care and this
[01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:49.200]  is all been done by design but let's play Sebelius up there arrogantly telling
[01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:54.000]  people that yes felons can come to your house and basically threaten you because
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:58.040]  any say you're from the government you're supposed to bow to them I mean I've
[01:25:58.040 --> 01:26:06.680]  had 13 years ago in the 2000 census they kept coming to my door banging on it my
[01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:10.720]  girlfriend was there my wife now and I said next time they come you know just
[01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:13.000]  tell them come back when I'm there and the guy came back and he had a plastic
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:16.040]  badge he said listen I can have you arrested if you don't fill the sound I
[01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:19.840]  said listen buddy you can ask me how many people live here under the law I know
[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:23.320]  the law of the federal rulings you can't ask me 50 something questions because I
[01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:27.720]  got the community survey how much money I've got what type of toilet do I own
[01:26:27.720 --> 01:26:32.240]  guns I said you get off my property right now before I physically kick you
[01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:37.240]  off of it he goes I'll call the police I said good call him punk and I walked
[01:26:37.240 --> 01:26:42.640]  outside and followed him and he was parked in the middle of the the the
[01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:46.920]  street the neighborhood street I don't even cops parked like that just like he
[01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:53.400]  was God and I'm telling you you're gonna have felons coming and and they're
[01:26:53.400 --> 01:26:56.480]  already doing it and saying are you enroll well you better it's the law
[01:26:56.480 --> 01:27:00.280]  never it's personal just grovel let him in and just like you've had census
[01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:03.880]  people raping and robbing people I predict what's already started they're
[01:27:03.880 --> 01:27:07.600]  already stealing the money that it's going to be absolute kleptocracy because
[01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:12.320]  that was the plan got to give the crew some little stuff to have fun on the
[01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:19.480]  suckers it's all about ganging up on the suckers it's all about running game isn't
[01:27:19.480 --> 01:27:23.560]  it true that there is no federal requirement for navigators to undergo a
[01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:28.520]  criminal background check even though they will receive personal sensitive
[01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:31.880]  personal information from the individuals they help sign up for the
[01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:38.120]  Affordable Care Act that is true states could add an additional background
[01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:42.440]  checks and other features but it is not part of the federal requirement so a
[01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:48.560]  convicted felon could be a navigator and could acquire sensitive personal
[01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:54.080]  information from an individual unbeknownst to them that is possible
[01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:59.880]  no that's not possible the groups they've already hired are famous for
[01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:05.280]  stealing millions of dollars per city under previous government programs
[01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:09.200]  where they're supposed to go out and be community organizers see Obama's an
[01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:12.920]  expert on this these community organizers are government and corporate
[01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:17.840]  funded to come into an unpolitically organized system we're just taught to
[01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:23.040]  watch TV all day and organize rena mobs to call for taking our guns breaking up
[01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:26.800]  our families arresting people of your 10-year-old girl doesn't like a boy in

[01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:36.760]  this is a cult of criminals and they wrote this bill to bust this country
[01:28:36.760 --> 01:28:43.760]  wide open Obama has now shut down over 500 reactors excuse me 500 power plants

[01:34:23.280 --> 01:34:26.680]  literally hundreds of these solicitations because it's happening in
[01:34:26.680 --> 01:34:33.960]  every state in every major city New York Texas California they are doing this it
[01:34:33.960 --> 01:34:44.800]  is it is truly absolutely unprecedented what is unfolding right now and we're
[01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:48.000]  gonna be discussing that coming up the next hour and opening the phones up but
[01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:55.120]  I've got all this other news finishing up with the Obamacare situation it was
[01:34:55.120 --> 01:35:00.760]  their plan to wreck healthcare have a doctor shortage and then socialize it
[01:35:00.760 --> 01:35:09.760]  for the people charges unlimited amounts of money but then on top of that then
[01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:14.720]  transfer the profits to the offshore banks but they've overdone it this time
[01:35:14.720 --> 01:35:19.360]  and what's really gonna make people angry is that Congress is exempt the
[01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:24.400]  unions are gonna be made exempt already 2000 plus major companies are exempt
[01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:27.760]  Obama promised to get rid of the exemptions never got rid of them they
[01:35:27.760 --> 01:35:32.640]  play that game folks of lying lying lying lying saying I never said you'd be
[01:35:32.640 --> 01:35:35.840]  kicked off your health plan ever said that two days ago he's never said that
[01:35:35.840 --> 01:35:43.600]  that's lies by the racist right-wingers that's how you about race again now if
[01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:46.520]  I'm out and dining George Zimmerman the Justice Department does the criminals
[01:35:46.520 --> 01:35:50.360]  there again to create more racial fighting if they hype it enough there
[01:35:50.360 --> 01:35:54.720]  can be more more racial conflict this is total divide and conquer but now we
[01:35:54.720 --> 01:36:00.720]  learn trick-or-treat unions may get health law tax relief loyal Obama
[01:36:00.720 --> 01:36:05.720]  supporters lose insurance but they're okay with it because it's for their dear
[01:36:05.720 --> 01:36:10.760]  leader and then expanding on that if you go to drugreport.com x Obama
[01:36:10.760 --> 01:36:16.200]  secret service agent it's worse than people know I'm not trying to scare you
[01:36:16.200 --> 01:36:22.200]  he goes on to say and we're gonna get him back on here in the next few days but
[01:36:22.200 --> 01:36:29.080]  the video is up there on info wars.com as well and you can see his last
[01:36:29.080 --> 01:36:34.600]  interview with us as well we've added to the article since the number one
[01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:40.120]  disart in the world Roger port.com link to it but I have been told by IT and
[01:36:40.120 --> 01:36:43.960]  they're very proud of themselves that the website is staying up this is the
[01:36:43.960 --> 01:36:48.680]  most traffic info wars has ever received I don't know why I mean it's
[01:36:48.680 --> 01:36:53.480]  important he's see Bongino signed national security agreements because he was
[01:36:53.480 --> 01:36:58.000]  the number one guy over Obama's foreign trips and he said the stuff he heard was
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:03.520]  so evil he had to quit and he's now getting his house broken into business
[01:37:03.520 --> 01:37:08.480]  broken into car messed with family threatened because obviously what he
[01:37:08.480 --> 01:37:12.320]  knows and I've told him you better go ahead and say it you know because and
[01:37:12.320 --> 01:37:15.280]  he's like well it's not completely criminal so it was completely criminal
[01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:18.560]  I'd have to go public but he goes no one's gonna prosecute him at the Justice
[01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:23.480]  Department but he said it's worse than people know and I'm not trying to scare
[01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:28.320]  you either but basically he said it's open Marxism and bring down America
[01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:31.880]  clout and pivot I mean it's they're in there Obama's walking around going I'm
[01:37:31.880 --> 01:37:36.440]  good at killing people we're taking over we'll get those bitter clanger scum
[01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:39.560]  we're gonna break up everybody's families I mean that's the word from
[01:37:39.560 --> 01:37:48.800]  other Secret Service I have another I don't want to say it folks because it we
[01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:52.640]  have Secret Service agents inside the White House okay and I mean I think that
[01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:56.640]  just needs to be known okay through my intermediaries I'll just leave it at
[01:37:56.640 --> 01:38:00.080]  that because they know how to contact me without it going through telephones and
[01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:04.080]  stuff they say oh they say you're absolutely correct it is unbelievable
[01:38:04.080 --> 01:38:09.760]  and they cry at night they cry you've heard the military officers call in and
[01:38:09.760 --> 01:38:14.280]  say that their officers are crying and it's not that they're wimps folks when
[01:38:14.280 --> 01:38:17.880]  you're like stand around the whole country standing there and there's an
[01:38:17.880 --> 01:38:22.200]  absolute guy trying to become dictator it's like Hitler in 1934 or something I
[01:38:22.200 --> 01:38:27.240]  mean this is I'm telling you I'm not usually wrong I didn't think Obama would
[01:38:27.240 --> 01:38:31.360]  be this bad I thought it'd be bad come after our guns can't be Bill Clinton or
[01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:37.120]  something this is bad I mean this is bad and that's what Bongino saying he's
[01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:41.200]  saying you have no idea that's what he said here I go what is it goes I just
[01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:46.400]  just imagine everything you see in public and then some remember Hillary
[01:38:46.400 --> 01:38:50.400]  Clinton had like Stalin and linen on the Christmas tree and crack pipes and
[01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:54.760]  then she got confronted about it back in the mid 90s and said big deal it's that
[01:38:54.760 --> 01:38:58.560]  they're like perverts it's it's like who wants to hang crack pipes on a
[01:38:58.560 --> 01:39:03.360]  Christmas tree they like get off on bad stuff they like I guess they like
[01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:07.400]  leaking nuclear reactors and they like flesh-eating bacteria spreading
[01:39:07.400 --> 01:39:10.600]  everywhere and they they're like devils so they're not like devils these people
[01:39:10.600 --> 01:39:18.280]  are devils so that story is up on info wars.com and now the Democrats have
[01:39:18.280 --> 01:39:21.960]  got a win in Virginia they're going after the guns there I mean these people
[01:39:21.960 --> 01:39:26.000]  have got us and they think that you know that this is their season they know
[01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:29.280]  people are waking up to them so their job is to wreck the country as fast as
[01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:34.640]  possible and I guess wreck the planet as fast as possible I mean it's criminal
[01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:39.200]  intent it's criminal energy it's not criminals that steal just to get wealthy
[01:39:39.200 --> 01:39:43.680]  there's different types of criminals of criminology there's that type but then
[01:39:43.680 --> 01:39:47.840]  there's people that like criminal activity you know I mean that's what
[01:39:47.840 --> 01:39:52.280]  we're dealing with here okay just like they're letting criminals get jobs to
[01:39:52.280 --> 01:39:55.680]  get your data because they're Democratic Party operatives that launder that
[01:39:55.680 --> 01:40:01.000]  money folks acre in and all that you can walk in any acre in office from run and
[01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:05.320]  go I'm running on children sex slaves great we'll sign it right up just go the
[01:40:05.320 --> 01:40:09.200]  next office I'm running sex slaves children good we'll tell you how to run
[01:40:09.200 --> 01:40:12.440]  it with the folks so you don't get any trouble let's get that cash going right
[01:40:12.440 --> 01:40:19.400]  now I mean you know it is it is so evil now Anthony Gutierrez here with huge
[01:40:19.400 --> 01:40:25.880]  Monsanto news but first this story came out a few days ago and we mentioned it
[01:40:25.880 --> 01:40:30.120]  we have the clip we're gonna play it in a moment if you just joined us by the man
[01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:36.440]  voted most popular like them like the man of Canada David Suzuki has gone on
[01:40:36.440 --> 01:40:41.160]  record and then he mentioned in the papers in the reports we've dug these
[01:40:41.160 --> 01:40:44.920]  up because we've covered these these are scientific reports what scientists have
[01:40:44.920 --> 01:40:48.880]  said the probability of an earthquake and what it'll do if there's full meltdown
[01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:54.680]  of the fuel rods stored there and the grounds all spongy and and and eroding
[01:40:54.680 --> 01:40:59.960]  into a huge sinkhole and another tsunami a seven point two earthquake it's over
[01:40:59.960 --> 01:41:03.880]  and it just shows the insanity of the power structure and now they're getting
[01:41:03.880 --> 01:41:07.760]  ready to start removing the fuel rods that statistically they believe will
[01:41:07.760 --> 01:41:11.840]  probably cause them to bang together and catch on fire and then you've got a full
[01:41:11.840 --> 01:41:16.160]  meltdown on your hands so Anthony Gutierrez who's really our expert on
[01:41:16.160 --> 01:41:21.400]  Fukushima covering the latest information joins us in studio to talk
[01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:25.800]  about the madness of these people his article is the top story on info wars
[01:41:25.800 --> 01:41:31.240]  dot com right now and Anthony tell us the situation well you notice how they
[01:41:31.240 --> 01:41:36.600]  craft the debate now it's about the TSA agent should they be armed meanwhile we
[01:41:36.600 --> 01:41:40.760]  have top generals saying yes the nuclear weapons are you know they're missing and
[01:41:40.760 --> 01:41:44.720]  we have major problems Obama is getting rid of all the top guys who will not
[01:41:44.720 --> 01:41:48.760]  listen to him and play ball and now we have this scientist is internationally
[01:41:48.760 --> 01:41:52.240]  recognized scientist he has his own television show actually and yes he was
[01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:55.760]  the number five guy in Canada the number one living man in Canada the most
[01:41:55.760 --> 01:42:00.360]  popular had the most votes everyone loves him and he went to this forum and
[01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:03.760]  thankfully someone captured it with their iPhone or else we would never know
[01:42:03.760 --> 01:42:07.600]  and he was alerting them kind of like a behind-the-scenes deal saying listen you
[01:42:07.600 --> 01:42:12.960]  know this is about water ecology this this conference this symposium but the
[01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:17.560]  real thing is Fukushima and he was saying if just one more earthquake seven
[01:42:17.560 --> 01:42:21.400]  point hour higher happens and he said there's a 95% chance that it will
[01:42:21.400 --> 01:42:25.240]  happen over the next three years then Fukushima would just absolutely melt
[01:42:25.240 --> 01:42:30.240]  down and the US would have to be evacuated and then that Japan would go
[01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:35.280]  quote-unquote bye-bye so he's basically saying everyone in Japan would die and
[01:42:35.280 --> 01:42:38.080]  he's a physicist and a bunch of other stuff yeah and it's not like we're
[01:42:38.080 --> 01:42:40.960]  saying this or wait we're making this up this is a direct quote he's saying
[01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:44.200]  there's a 95% chance this will happen in the next three years if we don't do
[01:42:44.200 --> 01:42:47.280]  something about it and I agree with that because that's our own analysis from
[01:42:47.280 --> 01:42:52.240]  Dr. Busby and other top folks we've had on we either I mean there should be 50
[01:42:52.240 --> 01:42:57.360]  thousand people there in radiation suits rotating in and out in lead suits in a
[01:42:57.360 --> 01:43:01.720]  world emergency to clean that out right now instead I've read that they can't
[01:43:01.720 --> 01:43:05.520]  get workers to go in the starfish are melting and dying the butterflies are
[01:43:05.520 --> 01:43:08.480]  dying and are mutated the kids are dropping dead people are staying there
[01:43:08.480 --> 01:43:11.840]  to take care of their horses and livestock they're dying and the answer is
[01:43:11.840 --> 01:43:15.120]  just let it happen no there's there's still plenty of people living in the
[01:43:15.120 --> 01:43:18.320]  Fukushima region well and cultures as they should be thankful no they should
[01:43:18.320 --> 01:43:21.440]  be now that whole idea is that if you have a little bit of radiation you get
[01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:26.800]  immunized like a vaccine but no the concept here is that tepco is now going
[01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:30.200]  in are you racist against radiation I'm absolutely racist against the
[01:43:30.200 --> 01:43:33.040]  radiation I don't want to take inculter radiation pills but maybe we should
[01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:37.680]  start promoting that so I think the key thing here is they call it the tepco
[01:43:37.680 --> 01:43:40.800]  mafia now because they're just so bad at what they do they're either incompetent
[01:43:40.800 --> 01:43:44.440]  or nefarious no one really knows I mean they're taping things up with duct tape
[01:43:44.440 --> 01:43:48.680]  at this nuclear plant it's on life support right now and they're taping
[01:43:48.680 --> 01:43:53.320]  up with duct tape but what's going on is the United States is moving in with
[01:43:53.320 --> 01:43:57.000]  some scientists some little guys to go maybe help with the Fukushima disaster
[01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:01.080]  that could potentially blow up and you know he says calls the US to evacuate
[01:44:01.080 --> 01:44:07.160]  but they're going in and they're going to test the reactor for extracting some
[01:44:07.160 --> 01:44:10.240]  fuel rods because they said that one was actually not melted down the other ones
[01:44:10.240 --> 01:44:15.080]  have volatile toxic elements inside of them all but the thing here and there's
[01:44:15.080 --> 01:44:21.120]  1400 of them if just two touch at all they will blow up and it could mean the
[01:44:21.120 --> 01:44:25.640]  entire explosion of the entire facility could just mean a massive amount of
[01:44:25.640 --> 01:44:29.680]  radiation leakage into the folks that don't know bombs are bad but they
[01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:34.600]  dissipate and are cleaner when they detonate there's less I mean you come
[01:44:34.600 --> 01:44:38.260]  at a small ball of it you know that blows up a whole city yes it's purified
[01:44:38.260 --> 01:44:44.520]  this is just mass ton upon ton six reactors smoldering half blown up just
[01:44:44.520 --> 01:44:48.640]  hellish and it's all sliding into the sea because they got to keep pumping water
[01:44:48.640 --> 01:44:53.400]  in on them to keep them from exploding I mean it's just a hellish situation well
[01:44:53.400 --> 01:44:57.040]  they admitted well actually TEPCO didn't admit first they lied and they said that
[01:44:57.040 --> 01:45:00.680]  it was just a bit of radiation then an independent study in Japan found it was
[01:45:00.680 --> 01:45:04.840]  two and a half times the amount of radiation initially released and that's 70%
[01:45:04.840 --> 01:45:08.480]  of all the sea seamen radioactive waste went into the Pacific Ocean on purpose
[01:45:08.480 --> 01:45:11.800]  they said that just by the way I'm gonna be honest I mean this is what I've said
[01:45:11.800 --> 01:45:14.640]  when I've talked about the nascent iodine that we produced and we shell
[01:45:14.640 --> 01:45:17.120]  because all the scientists doctors say this is the best thing for protecting
[01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:22.240]  thyroid but that's not a silver bullet the only thing I can do if this really
[01:45:22.240 --> 01:45:26.280]  blows up is I'm I've got to go to the southern hemisphere I guess I'll tell the
[01:45:26.280 --> 01:45:30.040]  crew come with me if you want to go and we're gonna have to like try to I mean
[01:45:30.040 --> 01:45:34.800]  this is like unbelievable this is unbelievable and and notice it was the
[01:45:34.800 --> 01:45:38.960]  Canadian version of Huffington Post where I found this guy's video and has a
[01:45:38.960 --> 01:45:42.680]  hundred something thousand views now we're publicizing it majorly but this
[01:45:42.680 --> 01:45:46.440]  wasn't even in the mainstream press it's like focusing was gonna blow up the
[01:45:46.440 --> 01:45:50.320]  US is gonna be evacuated Japan everyone in Japan by the way he's reading
[01:45:50.320 --> 01:45:53.600]  scientific papers that we've listed in the article this is what the scientists
[01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:57.720]  from bad to worse they look at the different scenarios there's not a good
[01:45:57.720 --> 01:46:01.440]  scenario unless you have like a hundred thousand people they work by the
[01:46:01.440 --> 01:46:05.160]  thousands one week on you give them some huge amount of pay to do it in lead
[01:46:05.160 --> 01:46:09.960]  suits you go in in an emergency situation you extract everything out of
[01:46:09.960 --> 01:46:13.840]  there but nobody wants it so everybody passes the buck as the time bomb just
[01:46:13.840 --> 01:46:18.040]  kicks down well this is this is the perfect psychology of these delusional
[01:46:18.040 --> 01:46:22.880]  people that's it and there's these people are insane and there's numerous
[01:46:22.880 --> 01:46:25.880]  ways they could do it with cement and everything they could have this you know
[01:46:25.880 --> 01:46:29.120]  a massive expansion that could protect everything to some degree but they're
[01:46:29.120 --> 01:46:32.000]  just not doing it they're like oh we'll just go in and remove those rods that's
[01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.600]  right it's been recommended that say 20 miles away with trucks you bring it to
[01:46:34.600 --> 01:46:39.480]  a giant quarry and you and and you have big sections where you get them pour
[01:46:39.480 --> 01:46:43.040]  concrete over them seal them and then move on but they won't do that either and
[01:46:43.040 --> 01:46:46.440]  then you ask what are you gonna do with those rods when you extract them shoot
[01:46:46.440 --> 01:46:50.000]  them in the space is most likely the answer and then meanwhile Obama's
[01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:53.720]  recommending we build all of these power nuclear power plants in the United
[01:46:53.720 --> 01:46:58.000]  States along the coastline I mean this is just complete insanity just complete
[01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:02.400]  and utter chaos which I guess they want why I mean that's the joke from Dr.
[01:47:02.400 --> 01:47:05.760]  Busby is that it's like an alien racist secretly running things and they want
[01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:10.040]  higher radiation to live in and they're terraforming us with radiation I mean
[01:47:10.040 --> 01:47:12.840]  that's that's the only plausible and I'm not saying that I'm saying it's that
[01:47:12.840 --> 01:47:18.240]  crazy so it's a fertility is going down everything yeah it's it's but I mean it's
[01:47:18.240 --> 01:47:21.680]  madness where do these elites think they're going to live well it ties into
[01:47:21.680 --> 01:47:25.240]  this next story too with Washington and the GMO labeling because they're number
[01:47:25.240 --> 01:47:28.440]  one destroying the environment they're destroying the oceans with Fukushima but
[01:47:28.440 --> 01:47:33.080]  then they're manipulating beyond repair the food supply with their arctic vaults
[01:47:33.080 --> 01:47:36.720]  that have the only actual heirloom organic seeds they're just wasting the
[01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:39.960]  food supply just destroying it and obliterating it destroying the oceans
[01:47:39.960 --> 01:47:44.560]  every single piece of our biosphere is under attack including ourselves and
[01:47:44.560 --> 01:47:47.560]  then they've got all these fake environmental things tax carbon dioxide
[01:47:47.560 --> 01:47:51.680]  that's actually the lowest level ever recorded yes and they all the scientists
[01:47:51.680 --> 01:47:55.560]  on record say massive boost of this would actually accelerate life and help
[01:47:55.560 --> 01:47:59.400]  the planet it's like we're almost becoming Mars and we're losing our
[01:47:59.400 --> 01:48:04.080]  atmosphere they think all the nuke testing blue holes in it maybe they are
[01:48:04.080 --> 01:48:08.720]  being aliens it said to destroy us I mean I don't know I mean I mean it gets
[01:48:08.720 --> 01:48:11.560]  to the point where it's so insane you just have to reach for something she
[01:48:11.560 --> 01:48:15.520]  doesn't make any sense it's just either belligerent insanity or nefarious just
[01:48:15.520 --> 01:48:19.840]  intent on wrecking this planet like a golf ball just smashing over the hammer
[01:48:19.840 --> 01:48:22.920]  I mean we're not just talking about maybe there's not enough food we're talking
[01:48:22.920 --> 01:48:27.280]  about genetically impure food and the contamination of it on record over and
[01:48:27.280 --> 01:48:31.000]  over again in Washington within three generations sterilizes and mutates every
[01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:34.520]  mammal that eats it yes massive tumors to the point where rats can't walk and
[01:48:34.520 --> 01:48:38.120]  that's what we're eating right now guaranteed death sentence just and it's
[01:48:38.120 --> 01:48:42.160]  and in Monsanto has their own clean facilities with no GMO they will not
[01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:46.120]  eat it all the elite have secret gardens that's come out from from from from
[01:48:46.120 --> 01:48:50.400]  China to Europe that it's all a plan but they can't even guess the alien is the
[01:48:50.400 --> 01:48:53.160]  spirit of Satan possessing them I mean what do you think happens when we burn
[01:48:53.160 --> 01:48:56.360]  the GMO corn and what do you think happens with the chemtrails in the sky
[01:48:56.360 --> 01:48:59.640]  they can only shelter themselves so much they're going down with the ship they
[01:48:59.640 --> 01:49:02.960]  don't even understand it maybe but they're killing themselves too they
[01:49:02.960 --> 01:49:07.160]  can't escape that it's everywhere if they're going to unleash this Pandora's
[01:49:07.160 --> 01:49:11.280]  box I think they're being conned to I don't know I mean they just want to have
[01:49:11.280 --> 01:49:15.600]  like men in the girls bathrooms that's what they're into now that's that's the
[01:49:15.600 --> 01:49:19.440]  real mainstream media agenda is allowing 50 year old men without any
[01:49:19.440 --> 01:49:23.400]  surgeries into an eight-year-old girls locker room because of his rights you
[01:49:23.400 --> 01:49:28.360]  know his rights begin where his emotions start coming into play our our rights
[01:49:28.360 --> 01:49:31.800]  end when his emotions begin because he wants to be in a room with our daughters
[01:49:31.800 --> 01:49:35.760]  exactly but then you know Fukushima blowing up and us having to evacuate
[01:49:35.760 --> 01:49:40.000]  the foods black being completely contaminated and look at this 22 million
[01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:45.120]  was spent on destroying GMO labeling in Washington take a guess how much came
[01:49:45.120 --> 01:49:49.880]  from residents if you haven't read this article you say maybe 100,000 no $500
[01:49:49.880 --> 01:49:55.280]  of $22 million came from residents of Washington the rest was it has the
[01:49:55.280 --> 01:49:58.720]  list here on USA Today they can't even cover it up anymore it was Monsanto
[01:49:58.720 --> 01:50:03.520]  DuPont, Dow Agro Sciences and Bayer Crop Science every time it's a propaganda
[01:50:03.520 --> 01:50:07.080]  tyranny machine and they're crushing reality. Bayer are the same folks that
[01:50:07.080 --> 01:50:11.720]  knowingly put HIV in the factor eight for kids. Oh and Monsanto the same folks
[01:50:11.720 --> 01:50:15.880]  that worked with Dow Agro Sciences to make Agent Orange 500,000 killed
[01:50:15.880 --> 01:50:19.120]  multiple birth defects that's conservative estimates you know Dow Agro
[01:50:19.120 --> 01:50:22.240]  Science working on biopharmaceutical crops yeah we're gonna throw the
[01:50:22.240 --> 01:50:25.840]  experimental anthrax vaccine which kills kids. They have new corn coming out of
[01:50:25.840 --> 01:50:29.560]  their heads like pigs in it pig genes. Oh yeah well that's how they use it to make
[01:50:29.560 --> 01:50:32.560]  these biopharmaceutical crops they splice the genes and then they put a
[01:50:32.560 --> 01:50:36.200]  vaccine component or an antibiotic or an antidepressant that's the new thing.
[01:50:36.200 --> 01:50:40.240]  And they've been caught stacking other secret goodies in. Yeah antidepressant
[01:50:40.240 --> 01:50:43.960]  crops on your dinner table there's no way the FDA is gonna label it they're
[01:50:43.960 --> 01:50:46.440]  just gonna say it's good they'll put statins in there just like they're
[01:50:46.440 --> 01:50:49.720]  trying to do it in the water. By the way we're not saying this they're saying it
[01:50:49.720 --> 01:50:53.000]  it's all official. No I want to come back and talk more about Monsanto and this
[01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:58.800]  latest development there with the vote. Stay with us ladies and gentlemen.

[01:54:25.560 --> 01:54:37.600]  ladies and gentlemen everything the globalists do is insane and
[01:54:37.600 --> 01:54:42.620]  degenerate and evil everything they do is where they have the moral high
[01:54:42.620 --> 01:54:46.600]  grounded they care about you and they're doing a great thing I've been I've been
[01:54:46.600 --> 01:54:50.600]  researching GMOs for about 18 years and I've had all these top scientists on
[01:54:50.600 --> 01:54:54.120]  we're making millions of dollars a year and morally saw the rats dying and
[01:54:54.120 --> 01:54:58.400]  getting sick eating this stuff and saying there's a eugenics component and
[01:54:58.400 --> 01:55:02.600]  they're and they're hiding stuff in these and this is like stuff 10 15 years
[01:55:02.600 --> 01:55:06.160]  ago that's nothing compared to what's come out now and then you look at what
[01:55:06.160 --> 01:55:12.040]  it does to people on record you look at the effect that it's having because
[01:55:12.040 --> 01:55:15.240]  humans are in a generation every 20 30 years with rats it can be a couple times
[01:55:15.240 --> 01:55:19.000]  a year they know in guinea pigs they know in rats look up GMO studies and rats
[01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:24.560]  GMO studies in the guinea pigs I mean we're talking about eyeballs twice the
[01:55:24.560 --> 01:55:29.160]  size hair growing out their mouths giant tumors everywhere 99% sterilization by
[01:55:29.160 --> 01:55:32.960]  three generations totally retarded and then you look at all the statistics
[01:55:32.960 --> 01:55:38.720]  we're one generation in it's devastating us gut gut disorders and and I guess
[01:55:38.720 --> 01:55:42.040]  this is all there there Anthony what do you think is at the heart of this whole
[01:55:42.040 --> 01:55:46.760]  GMO takeover well we can look at it as a whole paradigm of this government
[01:55:46.760 --> 01:55:49.600]  system there's a reason the top generals are being purged why is that
[01:55:49.600 --> 01:55:53.680]  they're not playing ball with Obama why then are there so many people coming out
[01:55:53.680 --> 01:55:57.200]  from these biotech companies emailing me and telling me information insiders
[01:55:57.200 --> 01:56:00.440]  telling me what's going on because the same deal Monsanto and these other
[01:56:00.440 --> 01:56:04.480]  companies are purging the employees and the top executives in the top PR guys who
[01:56:04.480 --> 01:56:08.320]  aren't willing to go the next level the next level is bio pharmaceutical crops
[01:56:08.320 --> 01:56:12.920]  the next level is the vaccine components in your food GMOs are nothing
[01:56:12.920 --> 01:56:16.840]  almost I mean it's the implement blueprint to get us to accept this whole
[01:56:16.840 --> 01:56:20.000]  paradigm they're going to force it down our throats because we're not except I
[01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:23.720]  think we can defeat it in many ways but after that becomes biopharmaceutical
[01:56:23.720 --> 01:56:28.240]  crops it becomes genetic clones of animals it becomes bio pharmaceutical
[01:56:28.240 --> 01:56:31.280]  there's already cloned animals on the shelves yeah exactly but it's going
[01:56:31.280 --> 01:56:34.880]  mainstream and then we're talking things like the 2045 project if you're
[01:56:34.880 --> 01:56:38.080]  familiar with that which is essentially that everyone will be genetically
[01:56:38.080 --> 01:56:42.120]  modified holograms of themselves and it sounds insane but this is what these
[01:56:42.120 --> 01:56:45.120]  biotech companies are moving towards no no no I mean exactly the New York Times
[01:56:45.120 --> 01:56:49.400]  will make fun of me when I quote Google execs and Ray Kurzweil saying I said it
[01:56:49.400 --> 01:56:54.760]  no no they said this is their plan no they're the ones launching secret black
[01:56:54.760 --> 01:56:59.880]  barges they're the ones saying they're gonna be gods not me I think they're
[01:56:59.880 --> 01:57:04.360]  I think they should all be rounded up basically Bill Gates in an interview said
[01:57:04.360 --> 01:57:06.800]  they said well you know what are you gonna do before you die said I'm not gonna
[01:57:06.800 --> 01:57:11.320]  die and it was real smug like I'm not gonna die they think they're gonna live
[01:57:11.320 --> 01:57:15.280]  forever in these genetically modified bodies that's what they believe exactly
[01:57:15.280 --> 01:57:18.040]  they said they're gonna merge with silicones so the radiation isn't
[01:57:18.040 --> 01:57:21.680]  gonna hurt them and they don't they don't think they need food or sustenance
[01:57:21.680 --> 01:57:24.760]  anymore because they'll just and they're poisoning everything to wipe us out and
[01:57:24.760 --> 01:57:29.000]  they'll program their brains into this genetically modified artificial body put
[01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:32.680]  a chip in and that's their consciousness they believe they can transport our
[01:57:32.680 --> 01:57:36.200]  memories and everything into an artificial being and by the way it's not
[01:57:36.200 --> 01:57:40.160]  like it's a couple of them this is all they say at the Ted conference all the
[01:57:40.160 --> 01:57:43.600]  top people do this is their religion they have major transhumanistic
[01:57:43.600 --> 01:57:47.840]  conferences the head guys at Google are into it Bill Gates is into it Ray Kurz
[01:57:47.840 --> 01:57:51.840]  Wilds been predicting it for decades but look up 2045 program the Russian
[01:57:51.840 --> 01:57:55.560]  scientists were developing this idea that you first you have by 2045 you have
[01:57:55.560 --> 01:58:00.120]  the ultimate hologram artificial GMO no we've covered it yeah yeah by 2015 the
[01:58:00.120 --> 01:58:03.400]  beginnings of it and they give a timetable it's actually further out so
[01:58:03.400 --> 01:58:06.440]  folks don't get concerned and you have to be a billionaire to get into it you
[01:58:06.440 --> 01:58:09.920]  have to pay millions upon millions of dollars the it'll be the elite class
[01:58:09.920 --> 01:58:15.320]  that gets it and the peasantry us we'll be able to work for them to get enough
[01:58:15.320 --> 01:58:19.520]  money to have and we'll get the fact similarly the control stuff it'll be the
[01:58:19.520 --> 01:58:23.560]  new bling everyone wants it oh yeah I got my augmenter I'm totally cool I've
[01:58:23.560 --> 01:58:28.080]  got a six and nine four three chip oh yeah I mean and it's just gonna be and
[01:58:28.080 --> 01:58:31.760]  Lady Gaga will have it or whatever the new idiot is I mean not that ever we
[01:58:31.760 --> 01:58:34.720]  want your souls what they're saying exactly there I want to finish up then
[01:58:34.720 --> 01:58:37.600]  we're gonna give the phone number out and talk to military and police about the
[01:58:37.600 --> 01:58:48.920]  purge that is taking place you are listening to GCN visit GCNLive.com today
[01:58:49.920 --> 01:58:55.680]  introducing pro one all of your filtration in one system portable on the
[01:58:55.680 --> 01:59:00.520]  go no more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride
[01:59:00.520 --> 01:59:05.440]  you have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydro

[02:00:17.360 --> 02:00:21.480]  yeah so ABC News this morning they were promoting that we'll all soon have chips
[02:00:21.480 --> 02:00:25.200]  in our skin and then chips in our brains and it's gonna be sold as the trendy
[02:00:25.200 --> 02:00:31.040]  thing the cool thing to do Anthony Guciardi is our guest I'm gonna give the
[02:00:31.040 --> 02:00:35.400]  toll-free number off for military and police active duty folks on what I
[02:00:35.400 --> 02:00:39.680]  covered in the first hour where now you don't just have us you have retired
[02:00:39.680 --> 02:00:47.920]  major generals former special forces commanders you name it going public that
[02:00:47.920 --> 02:00:52.640]  there is a massive purge in fact this is the latest world in the early article
[02:00:52.640 --> 02:00:56.920]  you guys give me that the first one about all this confirming our reports it
[02:00:56.920 --> 02:01:02.160]  it's it's yep yeah from yeah from two days ago this is purge surge Obama fires
[02:01:02.160 --> 02:01:05.560]  another commander it's linked in this article and has the listing of some of
[02:01:05.560 --> 02:01:13.920]  the top major generals Brigadier generals and lieutenant generals and and rear
[02:01:13.920 --> 02:01:17.000]  admirals you name it that are going public and they're being told
[02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:20.680]  Obama's about to give some orders they're gonna be unpopular we go along with
[02:01:20.680 --> 02:01:25.120]  them and I just can't believe it's gotten this part but but Anthony getting
[02:01:25.120 --> 02:01:28.720]  back to the general madness for folks that don't know this is what Monsanto
[02:01:28.720 --> 02:01:34.120]  says but then you find out as long going back to 99 they will not have it in
[02:01:34.120 --> 02:01:37.640]  their own cafeteria's on the way yeah of course they're eating organic foods
[02:01:37.640 --> 02:01:40.960]  their executives would never touch it and that's why you have also though the
[02:01:40.960 --> 02:01:44.160]  executives going in just like you said with the generals and saying hey guys are
[02:01:44.160 --> 02:01:47.760]  you okay with biopharmaceutical crops are you okay with genetically
[02:01:47.760 --> 02:01:51.440]  engineering the human genome and the guys that say no they get the boot and
[02:01:51.440 --> 02:01:55.040]  that's why we get these emails from these crazy people one that's 100% confirmed
[02:01:55.040 --> 02:01:59.040]  I talked a long time ago with Mike Adams about on this very show we premiered it
[02:01:59.040 --> 02:02:03.600]  here was the email from the biotech scientists who told me that it's a good
[02:02:03.600 --> 02:02:07.600]  thing that the crops he's working on are killing people and giving people tumors
[02:02:07.600 --> 02:02:10.880]  like we saw in the rat studies because there's too many people on this planet
[02:02:10.880 --> 02:02:14.240]  and he was happy he said it was quote-unquote awesome that it was killing
[02:02:14.240 --> 02:02:18.240]  people we premiered that here and I was able to verify it was from one of those
[02:02:18.240 --> 02:02:22.360]  biotech companies they were just talking and raving about oh if I'm an enemy of
[02:02:22.360 --> 02:02:25.080]  humanity that's amazing because I want to know I had some of the Russian
[02:02:25.080 --> 02:02:29.160]  scientists on that were like 20 years ago they noticed when they fed the rats
[02:02:29.160 --> 02:02:34.280]  the GMO feed they were all becoming sterilized and dying so they did a study
[02:02:34.280 --> 02:02:39.920]  and notice it didn't kill the ones they fed them the normal feed and then the
[02:02:39.920 --> 02:02:42.360]  head director came in and said well that's actually piggyback that's the
[02:02:42.360 --> 02:02:47.000]  plan this is a famous case there's so many people so shut up and the studies
[02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:50.480]  by the way it's a combined effect of every single thing that's hitting us all
[02:02:50.480 --> 02:02:54.640]  at once the GMOs are a prime suspect but at the same time you have infertility
[02:02:54.640 --> 02:02:59.080]  because of things like BPA well it's just like the Batman episode or movie
[02:02:59.080 --> 02:03:03.000]  where you put on one cosmetic and then the other and then it activates its
[02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:07.480]  binary weapons and they do that so they can just avoid one of them if they have
[02:03:07.480 --> 02:03:11.200]  to and it doesn't hit him as hard they've known forever there's no such thing as
[02:03:11.200 --> 02:03:14.320]  junk DNA they know how to target that junk well it just got confirmed earlier
[02:03:14.320 --> 02:03:19.960]  this year that these GMOs do cause mutagenic effects in the DNA not just in
[02:03:19.960 --> 02:03:23.480]  the overall tissues and the it's reprogramming us the key has always been
[02:03:23.480 --> 02:03:27.000]  the junk DNA which they now admit is actually the most important thing it's
[02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:31.480]  because it's before your immunity that determines if you're gonna get sick the
[02:03:31.480 --> 02:03:35.320]  power of your junk DNA and that's what they're targeting over and over and over
[02:03:35.320 --> 02:03:39.200]  again and hitting and that's why the generationally we do have these problems
[02:03:39.200 --> 02:03:42.640]  but then it's like I was saying the GMOs are just a one part of the
[02:03:42.640 --> 02:03:46.000]  culmination of the attack the BPA is really what's hitting the infertility
[02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:49.640]  the GMOs are just destroying your immune system and ability to fight it to
[02:03:49.640 --> 02:03:52.880]  the point where it's just a KO KO KO it's like headshot headshot headshot it's
[02:03:52.880 --> 02:03:56.600]  on humanity over and over and over that's right and they now know that in the so
[02:03:56.600 --> 02:04:00.880]  called junk DNA is basically the race memory of the species and that's where
[02:04:00.880 --> 02:04:06.000]  all the good mutations are coming from the resistance so they're I mean they
[02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:09.720]  are literally I mean if I was an alien species that came here I would take over
[02:04:09.720 --> 02:04:14.120]  the elite and run this plan I mean this is a pure anti-human plan that's why I
[02:04:14.120 --> 02:04:18.760]  say the elite might as well be a foreign aliens these people aren't even human in
[02:04:18.760 --> 02:04:22.600]  my view and they say we're not human they've dehumanized us they've declared
[02:04:22.600 --> 02:04:26.600]  war on humanity they are the enemy well they think they're not human because
[02:04:26.600 --> 02:04:29.840]  statistically there's actually been things in the Daily Mail they've been
[02:04:29.840 --> 02:04:33.720]  interbreeding for so long their DNA they have a third group yes and they think
[02:04:33.720 --> 02:04:39.000]  that makes them gods but in reality is actually just degenerative interbreeding
[02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:42.560]  and there's different ways to look at it but basically the Daily Mail you know
[02:04:42.560 --> 02:04:45.960]  and others were saying it's it's amazing look we found this this amazing
[02:04:45.960 --> 02:04:49.080]  scientific discovery these certain types of people have different DNA they
[02:04:49.080 --> 02:04:52.520]  believe they are gods and we are peons to be killed that's what they really
[02:04:52.520 --> 02:04:55.200]  believe but at the same time they're killing themselves they think they're
[02:04:55.200 --> 02:04:58.240]  gonna have these artificial bodies hold on I want to finish up on Fukushima and
[02:04:58.240 --> 02:05:02.400]  we're gonna go to phone call stay with us Alex Jones here with a message to

[02:06:59.200 --> 02:07:04.800]  wars life.com a little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why
[02:07:04.800 --> 02:07:08.320]  even if I had a pretty good-sized meal that I was still starving and my
[02:07:08.320 --> 02:07:12.640]  research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our
[02:07:12.640 --> 02:07:16.080]  crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are
[02:07:16.080 --> 02:07:20.720]  almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace

[02:08:03.360 --> 02:08:09.500]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones on the
[02:08:09.500 --> 02:08:15.720]  GCN radio network there is an unprecedented purge of now more than
[02:08:15.720 --> 02:08:23.680]  200 top military brass and the key is the Associated Press reported now a few
[02:08:23.680 --> 02:08:28.920]  weeks ago we wrote about it and covered it here on air that it's secret that AP
[02:08:28.920 --> 02:08:33.800]  had to be leaked that Obama doesn't want people know knowing that he's firing the
[02:08:33.800 --> 02:08:39.920]  top brass across the board basically and he doesn't want it known why and then
[02:08:39.920 --> 02:08:44.560]  we learned that it's simply the president has no confidence in you so this
[02:08:44.560 --> 02:08:50.400]  is purge material and it's unprecedented and it lines up with everything else but
[02:08:50.400 --> 02:08:54.200]  Homeland Security's come out and said we're not doing any urban warfare training
[02:08:54.200 --> 02:08:56.800]  we're not doing any riot control training we're not preparing for that
[02:08:56.800 --> 02:08:59.440]  they're always preparing for it the point is that they're massively
[02:08:59.440 --> 02:09:03.680]  accelerating it now on record it's in the news everywhere the military
[02:09:03.680 --> 02:09:07.380]  commanders have been told to be truthful about it it's been in the local
[02:09:07.380 --> 02:09:11.280]  Fort Hood newspaper they're preparing for a new enemy us I've played the
[02:09:11.280 --> 02:09:16.800]  newscast here that's a quote their new enemy us and then they come out and say
[02:09:16.800 --> 02:09:23.120]  we're not doing that Kurt Nemo's written a story Obama's unprecedented purge of
[02:09:23.120 --> 02:09:26.400]  the US military breaking down what's currently happening and getting into
[02:09:26.400 --> 02:09:31.520]  some of the history of it we've got a backward society sombrero Halloween
[02:09:31.520 --> 02:09:37.840]  costume branded offensive all 9-11 attack costume wins award man you talk
[02:09:37.840 --> 02:09:41.920]  about control folks I mean this is just they've got a list everything is
[02:09:41.920 --> 02:09:46.560]  racism so they can make you the bad guy this is total total authoritarianism
[02:09:46.560 --> 02:09:49.920]  but I want to finish up with what we were getting into if you just joined us
[02:09:49.920 --> 02:09:55.360]  Anthony Gutiarty of a natural society comm story leak comm he comes in and
[02:09:55.360 --> 02:09:58.800]  contributes on a routine basis as he lives here in Austin just like Mike
[02:09:58.800 --> 02:10:04.680]  Adams does to info wars comm and he was mentioning how the elite do think they're
[02:10:04.680 --> 02:10:07.960]  different from us and that we're animals and they thought this throughout
[02:10:07.960 --> 02:10:11.400]  history the Egyptians were interbreeding could hardly talk their
[02:10:11.400 --> 02:10:17.600]  leadership 15 was old I've gone and seen Egyptian mummies completely deformed
[02:10:17.600 --> 02:10:23.000]  heads because of it but but they get insane and psychopathic like any breed
[02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:30.360]  of dog you you overbreed it's the hybrid vigor of the hybridization that makes
[02:10:30.360 --> 02:10:35.320]  us you know really strong historically but the whole point is is that they're
[02:10:35.320 --> 02:10:40.440]  totally inbred from original dominant genetics of their ancestors many as
[02:10:40.440 --> 02:10:44.440]  were powerful you know conquers but then they interbreed it makes this
[02:10:44.440 --> 02:10:48.440]  insanity here's the BBC since he mentioned that I wanted to back him up
[02:10:48.440 --> 02:10:53.560]  human species may split in two and it just goes on to say the elite believe
[02:10:53.560 --> 02:10:57.040]  that they'll be beautiful and smart and wonderful and quote we will be little
[02:10:57.040 --> 02:11:01.480]  goblin creatures and it shows someone that actually looks like the Queen of
[02:11:01.480 --> 02:11:06.280]  England or the elite or Diane Feinstein so that's actually what you look like
[02:11:06.280 --> 02:11:11.520]  when so see they want to make us like them in fact there it is evolved into
[02:11:11.520 --> 02:11:19.200]  ugly dim-witted squat goblin like creatures so well that's the case go
[02:11:19.200 --> 02:11:24.000]  goblins because you know the New World Order things were so down they can now
[02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:28.800]  set up checkpoints and do and do giant anal probes on people without surge
[02:11:28.800 --> 02:11:32.560]  warrants I mean I'm telling the police cars should change the thing from
[02:11:32.560 --> 02:11:37.920]  protect and serve to vicious vicious butt pirate rapers I mean I'm not even
[02:11:37.920 --> 02:11:41.800]  making a joke about this this is how far our country has fallen today that
[02:11:41.800 --> 02:11:46.960]  they're having debates about TSA may have to rock tolerance exam what you
[02:11:46.960 --> 02:11:50.200]  didn't like is grabbing your genitals well how about we take in a private
[02:11:50.200 --> 02:11:55.080]  screening okay so and if you criticize them while you're behind the shooting
[02:11:55.080 --> 02:11:58.400]  and now they're not just saying I'm behind the shooting of the poor TSA agent
[02:11:58.400 --> 02:12:01.640]  not by the way I'm against that as you know I'm against offensive violence only
[02:12:01.640 --> 02:12:08.520]  defense but they're now blaming Ron Paul Glenbeck Matt Drudge and just anybody
[02:12:08.520 --> 02:12:12.960]  else if you don't like having your genitals groped and put in a microwave
[02:12:12.960 --> 02:12:18.280]  oven where they naked body scan you you're a terrorist so there you go and it
[02:12:18.280 --> 02:12:22.400]  just gets crazier and crazier and crazier and we're gonna play the clip we
[02:12:22.400 --> 02:12:25.920]  haven't played it yet here in this hour top scientist another Fukushima quake
[02:12:25.920 --> 02:12:32.160]  would mean US evacuation bye-bye Japan and the IEA only has a seven level for
[02:12:32.160 --> 02:12:37.160]  nuclear disaster Fukushima's level seven they're about to go to a level eight
[02:12:37.160 --> 02:12:42.960]  which demands international action yeah yeah I mean this is a real emergency the
[02:12:42.960 --> 02:12:47.000]  whole world should be in there helping Japan volunteering to get that stuff out
[02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:53.880]  of there but this is a world where everybody just passes the buck and it
[02:12:53.880 --> 02:12:59.200]  is truly disgusting we'll get back to that in a moment but Anthony finishing
[02:12:59.200 --> 02:13:05.240]  up on Monsanto and the public's totally waking up to GMO the next level is
[02:13:05.240 --> 02:13:09.560]  pharmacological crops where Bill Gates and others and Bayer admit they're
[02:13:09.560 --> 02:13:13.160]  going to make you be docile with what they're engineering they're gonna make
[02:13:13.160 --> 02:13:18.640]  you behave yourself they're gonna make you have statins in the squash I mean
[02:13:18.640 --> 02:13:23.240]  this is all being rolled out right now it's ultimate control and there's
[02:13:23.240 --> 02:13:26.320]  parallels here with everything you can see a parallel with the mainstream media
[02:13:26.320 --> 02:13:30.080]  and the government over and over again specifically they're attacking you over
[02:13:30.080 --> 02:13:32.880]  the TSA because they think they can cut the head off the snake they want to
[02:13:32.880 --> 02:13:37.600]  destroy real authentic media they're threatened at first now they're on the
[02:13:37.600 --> 02:13:42.560]  assault they want to go after the threat of real media so they mock it they try
[02:13:42.560 --> 02:13:45.680]  to be it and when they failed like that specifically I call it Bloomberg every
[02:13:45.680 --> 02:13:48.920]  time they're trying to be alternative media but when they failed at it then
[02:13:48.920 --> 02:13:51.760]  they must kill alternative media and that's what they're going for right now
[02:13:51.760 --> 02:13:56.520]  this is the same thing we're seeing with Monsanto they tried at first to
[02:13:56.520 --> 02:14:01.240]  propagandize it and say oh GMOs are great they're good it works it wasn't
[02:14:01.240 --> 02:14:06.440]  working the citizens said absolutely not down with Monsanto 100 million times so
[02:14:06.440 --> 02:14:11.640]  now instead they're throwing millions of dollars to lie and slander these people
[02:14:11.640 --> 02:14:16.600]  that want GMO labeling like myself $22 million now I did the math I mentioned
[02:14:16.600 --> 02:14:21.640]  earlier that only $500 came from residents of the $22 million pushed by
[02:14:21.640 --> 02:14:26.160]  Monsanto and our others to defeat GMO labeling we did the math that equates to
[02:14:26.160 --> 02:14:34.240] .0025% of people actually supporting the supporting the attack on
[02:14:34.240 --> 02:14:41.120]  GMO labeling so.0025% supported Monsanto now on the flip side 30% of all
[02:14:41.120 --> 02:14:46.560]  contributions for GMO labeling came from people in the in Washington for the
[02:14:46.560 --> 02:14:50.540]  statewide initiative to label GMOs in Washington 30% you know that's election
[02:14:50.540 --> 02:14:54.120]  fraud though I mean you know that that that's gaming the system that we can't
[02:14:54.120 --> 02:14:57.560]  get it labeled oh those are just the public numbers I mean I'm sure it was
[02:14:57.560 --> 02:15:01.320]  actually overwhelming support but Obama of course pays off I mean Monsanto
[02:15:01.320 --> 02:15:06.520]  Ferdinand Slip pays off the judges the US State Department pays for DVDs and
[02:15:06.520 --> 02:15:10.720]  pamphlets for Monsanto to distribute overseas the taxpayer dollars well it's
[02:15:10.720 --> 02:15:13.760]  eugenics they admit get it over there and sterilize it buddy Bill Gates is
[02:15:13.760 --> 02:15:17.760]  supporting it and all the donations are going to Monsanto to fuel the GMO crop
[02:15:17.760 --> 02:15:21.480]  trade over in Africa they just absolutely sterilize it if you're against
[02:15:21.480 --> 02:15:24.760]  your reasons oh absolutely if you're against it you're not feeding the world
[02:15:24.760 --> 02:15:30.880]  even though the IASTD 900 scientists from the UN were sent out to say that GMO
[02:15:30.880 --> 02:15:34.560]  saved the world and saved the food supply but they found organic crops and
[02:15:34.560 --> 02:15:38.720]  traditional crops outperform GMOs and that GMOs that well I have family that
[02:15:38.720 --> 02:15:42.020]  are farmers and they say in most cases you end up getting bankrupt if they lie
[02:15:42.020 --> 02:15:46.680]  to you all this Monsanto roundup stuff it doesn't it in the end it bankrupt
[02:15:46.680 --> 02:15:50.720]  shoe and kills the soil it's all a fraud just like the flu shot has never
[02:15:50.720 --> 02:15:55.600]  protected anybody from the flu it gives you the flu that's all on record Indian
[02:15:55.600 --> 02:16:00.160]  suicides every 30 minutes farmer suicides in India every 30 minutes main
[02:16:00.160 --> 02:16:04.680]  reason Monsanto they say it's like cotton signing a deal with the devil their
[02:16:04.680 --> 02:16:08.600]  yields go down their crops are resistant to their pesticides they have to buy more
[02:16:08.600 --> 02:16:12.040]  the herbicides it's by more and more it doesn't work till they drink the very
[02:16:12.040 --> 02:16:14.720]  old herbicides that Monsanto gave them and killed them so what's the number is
[02:16:14.720 --> 02:16:18.720]  like a how many hundreds of thousands or a lot it's it's every 30 minutes a
[02:16:18.720 --> 02:16:21.240]  farmer kills them so that's not some number like a couple years ago like
[02:16:21.240 --> 02:16:24.680]  close to a hundred thousand it's called the suicide belt of the world in India I
[02:16:24.680 --> 02:16:27.440]  mean because Monsanto went in the beginning when they were launching and
[02:16:27.440 --> 02:16:32.760]  why are you racist Anthony it's racist don't even say the name Indian yeah it's
[02:16:32.760 --> 02:16:37.520]  racist identify countries now and say hey maybe we should help protect these
[02:16:37.520 --> 02:16:40.220]  people they're like no no you don't want to feed the world you don't like
[02:16:40.220 --> 02:16:43.040]  Monsanto well you know when I was a kid we'd go to Mexico and I'd buy some
[02:16:43.040 --> 02:16:46.680]  brewery and hang on my wall look neat and I run around you know wearing it
[02:16:46.680 --> 02:16:49.520]  that was because I was racist well now you would be expelled from school
[02:16:49.520 --> 02:16:56.320]  apparently Fukushima's not a problem oh no it's it's brown bags brown bags yeah
[02:16:56.320 --> 02:16:59.640]  I mean radiation that could cause a US evacuation is not a big deal to the
[02:16:59.640 --> 02:17:02.960]  mainstream media it's nothing I mean that's not even worth mentioning besides
[02:17:02.960 --> 02:17:07.120]  a little blog post on the Canadian version of Huffington Post I mean it's
[02:17:07.120 --> 02:17:11.120]  not even in the news RT's reporting on it they report on all the Fukushima stuff
[02:17:11.120 --> 02:17:14.680]  by the way speaking of Fukushima let's play the clip of award-winning
[02:17:14.680 --> 02:17:19.840]  scientist David Suzuki has gone on record in public top scientists another
[02:17:19.840 --> 02:17:26.160]  Fukushima quake would mean US evacuation on the west coast by by Japan if in
[02:17:26.160 --> 02:17:31.600]  fact the fourth plan goes under an earthquake and those rods are exposed
[02:17:31.600 --> 02:17:37.800]  it's by by Japan and everybody on the west coast of North America should
[02:17:37.800 --> 02:17:46.320]  evacuate that isn't terrifying I don't know what is and by the way we've had
[02:17:46.320 --> 02:17:50.760]  Dr. Buzz beyond we've had other physicists on this is a real possibility
[02:17:50.760 --> 02:17:54.920]  no it's there's no question I mean if there was another earthquake at the
[02:17:54.920 --> 02:17:58.680]  direct site of Fukushima I mean this is a top scientist who's researching this
[02:17:58.680 --> 02:18:03.240]  and this was a water ecology symposium in fact what's the hydrology term they
[02:18:03.240 --> 02:18:07.040]  use where it's all spongy and it's all sink holding no exactly it's a form of
[02:18:07.040 --> 02:18:11.040]  erosion that happens and basically liquefaction they've already destroyed
[02:18:11.040 --> 02:18:16.080]  the Pacific anyway and it's there's so much toxic debris and contaminants in
[02:18:16.080 --> 02:18:21.000]  this in the Pacific Ocean that is just swallowing the whole of Fukushima and
[02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:24.960]  God forbid there is another earthquake he says there's a 95% chance in the next
[02:18:24.960 --> 02:18:28.400]  three years there'll be one but one thing we didn't mention by the way I'm not
[02:18:28.400 --> 02:18:32.200]  even as concerned about the earthquake I'm concerned about TEPCO going in with
[02:18:32.200 --> 02:18:36.600]  those 1400 spent fuel rods and what and two of them coming together I think
[02:18:36.600 --> 02:18:39.720]  there's a much bigger probability of that happening and that's happening now
[02:18:39.720 --> 02:18:43.920]  this month in two weeks they're starting the test protocols for that and we have
[02:18:43.920 --> 02:18:49.640]  someone quoted here speaking on that Dr. Helen Caldecott says that two rods
[02:18:49.640 --> 02:18:52.840]  could touch each other in this process which has been done before and there
[02:18:52.840 --> 02:18:56.040]  could be a fission reaction and a very large release of radiation just from two
[02:18:56.040 --> 02:19:02.160]  rods I have less faith in TEPCO than I do I agree well your article is up on

[02:25:09.520 --> 02:25:14.240]  recipient of the US military's highest declaration of Medal of Honor said that
[02:25:14.240 --> 02:25:18.480]  top officers that he's talked to say President Obama's agenda is decimating
[02:25:18.480 --> 02:25:22.960]  morale the US ranks to the point where members no longer feel prepared to fight
[02:25:22.960 --> 02:25:28.920]  or to have the desire to win there's no doubt he Obama is on tent on a maciated

[02:25:53.600 --> 02:25:58.480]  Jerry Boykin who was with Delta Force we found a Delta Force and later Deputy
[02:25:58.480 --> 02:26:01.600]  Undersecretary of Defense for intelligence under President Bush says
[02:26:01.600 --> 02:26:04.960]  it's worrying that four-star generals are being retired at the rate that has
[02:26:04.960 --> 02:26:08.480]  occurred under Obama that are being fired over the past three years it's
[02:26:08.480 --> 02:26:12.520]  unprecedented for the number of four-star generals to be relieved of duty and it
[02:26:12.520 --> 02:26:17.360]  not necessarily a relief for cause Boykin said I believe there is a purging
[02:26:17.360 --> 02:26:20.640]  of the military said the problem is worse than we have ever seen yeah that's
[02:26:20.640 --> 02:26:26.000]  that's undoubted and and folks we know that AP reported that they were told
[02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:31.120]  not to report this information that it had to be leaked to them and that Obama
[02:26:31.120 --> 02:26:36.160]  does not want people knowing this is going on so I want to hear from people
[02:26:36.160 --> 02:26:39.880]  in the Department of Defense civilians active duty military officers

[02:26:50.160 --> 02:26:54.040]  it's getting crazier and crazier and they're already using the IRS to

[02:33:17.400 --> 02:33:29.160]  info war well the show has a bigger audience than it's ever had but we've
[02:33:29.160 --> 02:33:33.920]  had a bunch of people call in that are retired Department of Defense or out of
[02:33:33.920 --> 02:33:37.920]  the military wanted to comment about the purge on any given day with it when not
[02:33:37.920 --> 02:33:43.240]  even on subject military calls in to talk about the purge is but we've not
[02:33:43.240 --> 02:33:46.840]  gotten any calls from active to the military or police talking about
[02:33:46.840 --> 02:33:50.960]  preparations for riot control talking about preparations for economic
[02:33:50.960 --> 02:33:55.000]  collapse I mean we've got all the documents in fact here are some of the
[02:33:55.000 --> 02:34:00.840]  articles DHS publicly denies preparation for riots civil unrest flip-flop
[02:34:00.840 --> 02:34:04.840]  while admitting equipment and armed guards for quote civil disturbances
[02:34:04.840 --> 02:34:10.160]  federal agency claims otherwise remember the TSA would like be videotaped
[02:34:10.160 --> 02:34:13.640]  hundreds of times sticking their hands in the pants and they would say we don't
[02:34:13.640 --> 02:34:19.200]  do that that's a lie responding to an inquiry by the International Business
[02:34:19.200 --> 02:34:23.240]  Times regarding the recent purchase of riot control equipment that we broke
[02:34:23.240 --> 02:34:28.240]  the drudge carried pepper spray launchers pepper spray projectiles as
[02:34:28.240 --> 02:34:31.880]  well as the hiring of armed guards with top-secret security clearances I should
[02:34:31.880 --> 02:34:36.800]  add to protect government buildings the DHS dismiss reports primarily from
[02:34:36.800 --> 02:34:41.000]  info wars which such activity was related to preparations for domestic
[02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:46.360]  disorder these reports are false the reference federal protective services
[02:34:46.360 --> 02:34:51.800]  acquisition request including automatic pepper spray guns requested for
[02:34:51.800 --> 02:34:56.640]  protective security officers will replace an existing contract due to expire
[02:34:56.640 --> 02:35:00.520]  November 2014 which provides security and screening within federal facilities
[02:35:00.520 --> 02:35:05.440]  throughout the upstate New York area so they used one of many examples and you
[02:35:05.440 --> 02:35:08.600]  heard them there's also no drones over America even though there are and there's
[02:35:08.600 --> 02:35:13.360]  also Marisol the vaccines you know there are just goes on and on show there's
[02:35:13.360 --> 02:35:19.160]  all these admissions even in mainstream state-run media that that this is going
[02:35:19.160 --> 02:35:23.760]  on and they're busy telling us it's not so there was an article in the Fort Hood
[02:35:23.760 --> 02:35:26.440]  paper last week we wrote about where they were admitting it was for domestic
[02:35:26.440 --> 02:35:31.080]  unrest I mean this is all of the news so I'd like to hear from police military
[02:35:31.080 --> 02:35:36.720]  active duty on the purge on the civil unrest buildup what do you make of this
[02:35:36.720 --> 02:35:41.120]  latest lie and I see a lot of calls coming in there but none of them are
[02:35:41.120 --> 02:35:47.360]  calling in on the specific of that show again I'm going to give out the toll
[02:35:47.360 --> 02:35:58.720]  free number 800 259 92 31 800 259 92 31 but first while those calls are coming
[02:35:58.720 --> 02:36:04.800]  in I wanted to play a New World Order clip that only played part of in the
[02:36:04.800 --> 02:36:11.000]  first hour today that was just a few clips put together by my crew we could
[02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:17.640]  put hours of these out in fact I think it was the extra from fabled enemies that
[02:36:17.640 --> 02:36:26.680]  was the next Burmese film we produced where we just had hours hours if we
[02:36:26.680 --> 02:36:30.240]  wanted to use it all of them announcing global government New World Order and
[02:36:30.240 --> 02:36:34.400]  defining the current new order definition as a planetary corporate
[02:36:34.400 --> 02:36:38.360]  government that is above the law so I want to play this clip and then we'll
[02:36:38.360 --> 02:36:43.440]  come back and go to your phone calls again the toll free number and we'll
[02:36:43.440 --> 02:36:46.960]  also open it up for folks who want to talk about Obamacare any other news but
[02:36:46.960 --> 02:36:53.520]  we'll try to get those military calls in 800 259 92 31 and just open the phones
[02:36:53.520 --> 02:36:56.720]  entirely up there so you have some military calls coming in we'll go to
[02:36:56.720 --> 02:37:00.840]  those than the other calls but right now they blamed us a few days ago and
[02:37:00.840 --> 02:37:05.400]  yesterday that I believe in the New World Order I made that up and this
[02:37:05.400 --> 02:37:10.080]  imaginary thing made the guy reportedly go shoot the TSA people shooting and
[02:37:10.080 --> 02:37:15.360]  wounding six killing one folks the New World Order is what they call the new
[02:37:15.360 --> 02:37:19.840]  global order of when they use the term New World Order they mean a new global
[02:37:19.840 --> 02:37:24.160]  power structure run by them planetary government is what their definition of
[02:37:24.160 --> 02:37:29.080]  it means in all the big white papers but they'll still act like that no one's
[02:37:29.080 --> 02:37:33.280]  even using this term I mean for over a decade the media has said that I'm
[02:37:33.280 --> 02:37:38.760]  insane no one's even using this term so let's go to that club
[02:37:38.760 --> 02:37:43.480]  British Prime Minister Gordon today calling for a new world order to tackle
[02:37:43.480 --> 02:37:48.640]  our global economic crisis and the president outlined his vision of a new
[02:37:48.640 --> 02:37:53.440]  world order in which the US would participate fully we've got to give
[02:37:53.440 --> 02:37:57.720]  them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us
[02:37:57.720 --> 02:38:01.760]  would like to see so I see a world order in the future with a multi-polar
[02:38:01.760 --> 02:38:06.880]  world order I think the New World Order is emerging and with it the foundations
[02:38:06.880 --> 02:38:11.480]  of a new and progressive era of international cooperation but in a
[02:38:11.480 --> 02:38:17.240]  globalized economy we are going to have to take global responsibilities and
[02:38:17.240 --> 02:38:21.920]  they're going to is going to have to be some several semblance of global
[02:38:21.920 --> 02:38:26.400]  governance never before has a new world order had to be assembled from so many
[02:38:26.400 --> 02:38:33.200]  different perceptions or on so global a scale nor has any previous order had to
[02:38:33.200 --> 02:38:37.920]  combine the attributes of the historic balance of power system with global
[02:38:37.920 --> 02:38:43.480]  democratic opinion and the exploding technology of the contemporary period
[02:38:43.480 --> 02:38:50.720]  and I surely believe India will be a central actor in the new world order
[02:38:50.720 --> 02:38:54.640]  there also exists an extraordinary opportunity to perform for the first
[02:38:54.640 --> 02:39:01.600]  time in history a truly global society 2009 is also the first year of global
[02:39:01.600 --> 02:39:05.360]  governance with the establishment of the G20 in the middle of the financial
[02:39:05.360 --> 02:39:11.880]  crisis the climate conference in Copenhagen is another step towards the
[02:39:11.880 --> 02:39:15.280]  global management of our planet New World Order is the headline in the global
[02:39:15.280 --> 02:39:19.960]  mail in Canada is this global governance at last is it one world the
[02:39:19.960 --> 02:39:24.080]  central bankers in charge but aren't we all just living and dying for what the
[02:39:24.080 --> 02:39:30.320]  central banks do of course we are we are absolutely slaves to central banks
[02:39:35.440 --> 02:39:41.200]  we have before us the opportunity to forge for ourselves and for future
[02:39:41.200 --> 02:39:47.640]  generations a new world order a world where the rule of law not the law the
[02:39:47.640 --> 02:39:53.840]  jungle governs the conductive nations when we are successful and we will be
[02:39:53.840 --> 02:39:59.480]  and we will be we have a real chance at this new world order an order in which
[02:39:59.480 --> 02:40:02.680]  a credible united nation where the global is for above the law use its
[02:40:02.680 --> 02:40:08.560]  peacekeeping role to fulfill the promise and vision of the UN's founders it is a
[02:40:08.560 --> 02:40:16.240]  big idea a new world order a world in which there is the very real prospect
[02:40:16.240 --> 02:40:23.000]  of a new world order after 1989 president Bush said and it's a phrase that I often
[02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:27.800]  use myself that we needed a new world order there is a chance for the president
[02:40:27.800 --> 02:40:33.720]  the United States to use this disaster to carry out what his father a phrase his
[02:40:33.720 --> 02:40:38.440]  father used I think only once and hasn't been used since and that is a new world
[02:40:38.440 --> 02:40:43.800]  order so that the problem of the Bush presidency will be the emergence of a
[02:40:43.800 --> 02:40:49.000]  new international order within the next four years we will see the emergence of
[02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:54.280]  a new international order the beginning of a new international order the pieces
[02:40:54.280 --> 02:41:01.560]  are in flux soon they will settle again before they do let us reorder this
[02:41:01.560 --> 02:41:08.720]  world around us its task will be to develop an overall strategy for America
[02:41:08.720 --> 02:41:13.600]  in this period when really a new world order can be created it's a great
[02:41:13.600 --> 02:41:20.000]  opportunity it isn't just a crisis it's about the future of Europe and a new
[02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:25.640]  world order there's a need for a new world order but it has different
[02:41:25.640 --> 02:41:33.720]  characteristics in different parts of the world but today with Asia already
[02:41:33.720 --> 02:41:40.480]  out producing Europe India and China are clearly becoming part of our new order
[02:41:40.480 --> 02:41:49.480]  we are now facing a common challenge and the challenge is how to build a world
[02:41:49.480 --> 02:41:57.880]  order for the first time in history on a global basis so in conclusion ladies and
[02:41:57.880 --> 02:42:05.160]  gentlemen a new world is emerging it is a new world order with significantly
[02:42:05.160 --> 02:42:13.160]  different and radically new challenges the affirmative task we have now is is
[02:42:13.160 --> 02:42:18.840]  to actually create a new world order
[02:42:18.840 --> 02:42:23.800]  good evening everybody President Obama and British Prime Minister Gordon today
[02:42:23.800 --> 02:42:29.440]  calling for a new world order to tackle our global economic crisis and the
[02:42:29.440 --> 02:42:33.840]  president outlined his vision of a new world order in which the US would
[02:42:33.840 --> 02:42:39.400]  participate fully we've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world
[02:42:39.400 --> 02:42:43.240]  order that I think all of us would like to see so I see a world order in the
[02:42:43.240 --> 02:42:49.280]  future with a multi-polar so there you go folks we could keep playing that for
[02:42:49.280 --> 02:42:54.160]  hours we have clips of where they define it as the state is God the new order is
[02:42:54.160 --> 02:42:58.280]  the state is God the new order is a above-the-law planetary corporate system
[02:42:58.280 --> 02:43:03.000]  like out of rollerball with James Kahn or it doesn't matter he's the top
[02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:07.440]  football player in the world a top exec wants his wife and then he has to hand
[02:43:07.440 --> 02:43:13.800]  her over this is the new royalty ladies and gentlemen and by the way they don't
[02:43:13.800 --> 02:43:16.960]  want to just enslave you they're gonna use world government to turn the
[02:43:16.960 --> 02:43:24.360]  resources off to get you on state-run pensions and state-run welfare with all
[02:43:24.360 --> 02:43:28.600]  these big factories and GMO systems displacing your jobs and then you're
[02:43:28.600 --> 02:43:33.120]  you're a ward of the state so they can phase you out and then euthanize you as
[02:43:33.120 --> 02:43:37.040]  they go on to merge with the machines and become God now I'm not saying their
[02:43:37.040 --> 02:43:43.240]  plans want to work here it is in the BBC though human species is split into the
[02:43:43.240 --> 02:43:48.880]  elite and the subspecies goblin like creature that's the quote so that is
[02:43:48.880 --> 02:43:54.360]  their plan and they are completely megalomaniacal like Marie Antoinette
[02:43:54.360 --> 02:44:04.280]  let them eat cake out of their minds and extremely absolutely dangerous now I do
[02:44:04.280 --> 02:44:07.160]  want to go to your phone calls we've got military callers calling them but they
[02:44:07.160 --> 02:44:10.160]  won't they don't want to say if they're in the military that's how scared people
[02:44:10.160 --> 02:44:16.320]  are in this country but Bill we'll go to Bill then Tim then Evan then Simon and
[02:44:16.320 --> 02:44:20.080]  Jason then I got some other breaking news I should just mention here Adam
[02:44:20.080 --> 02:44:25.320]  Kokesh WJLA is reporting has pled guilty to weapon and drug charges for
[02:44:25.320 --> 02:44:30.000]  marijuana and having illegal weapons in the district of criminals so there you
[02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:33.880]  go he had said he was set up and he called me privately from jail saying it
[02:44:33.880 --> 02:44:37.520]  wasn't ready to come on the year but that he had been totally set up and stuff
[02:44:37.520 --> 02:44:41.120]  was planted on him but basically that he didn't know what he was gonna do because
[02:44:41.120 --> 02:44:44.080]  he couldn't prove that so I guess he just wanted out of there we'll try to get
[02:44:44.080 --> 02:44:49.400]  Adam Kokesh on the nightly news tonight or we'll see if he wants to come on the
[02:44:49.400 --> 02:44:52.880]  show I don't know so we'll see what unfolds with that second amendment
[02:44:52.880 --> 02:44:57.960]  activist clearly set up folks let's go to Bill in Illinois Bill you're on the
[02:44:57.960 --> 02:45:03.200]  ear go ahead hi Alex so my first time call in Chicago here I went today but
[02:45:03.200 --> 02:45:07.600]  welcome sir good good good I was actually got downtown today and I see
[02:45:07.600 --> 02:45:11.200]  people walking around looking at their cell phones like robots walking on
[02:45:11.200 --> 02:45:15.720]  front of cars and all that kind of stuff so it's pretty crazy so you called in
[02:45:15.720 --> 02:45:20.840]  about the purge of the top military actually no I called in because I don't
[02:45:20.840 --> 02:45:26.080]  believe our history books because the 9-11 you go 40 minutes after that
[02:45:26.080 --> 02:45:31.320]  happened the official story was laid out a hundred years now in the history
[02:45:31.320 --> 02:45:37.960]  books it's gonna say that's that's still gonna be the official story right go
[02:45:37.960 --> 02:45:42.680]  ahead do you believe that sir I was actually not listening to you I was
[02:45:42.680 --> 02:45:47.000]  asking John if you called in about the purge because it says on my screen you
[02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:51.560]  called in about the purge I don't screen calls you can call in when we have open
[02:45:51.560 --> 02:45:56.520]  lines I'm sick of people when I say that I'm talking about a purge saying did you
[02:45:56.520 --> 02:46:00.160]  tell him you were calling in about the purge I did not know I told him that's
[02:46:00.160 --> 02:46:03.480]  specifically I said it'd be an interesting color but I don't even care
[02:46:03.480 --> 02:46:06.320]  about that because I'm gonna screen your call here on air I miss what you said
[02:46:06.320 --> 02:46:11.400]  I was just asking real quick ask your question again about 9-11 well the
[02:46:11.400 --> 02:46:15.600]  official story was laid out 40 minutes after it happened right you're asking
[02:46:15.600 --> 02:46:19.840]  me if I believe the official story about 9-11 no no absolutely not I said the
[02:46:19.840 --> 02:46:23.280]  official story was laid out 40 minutes after it happened sure it was totally
[02:46:23.280 --> 02:46:28.680]  scripted all stage it was an inside job yeah yeah no sir I mean I am
[02:46:28.680 --> 02:46:32.720]  undoubtedly the founder of the 9-11 truth movement I'm the guy that's put
[02:46:32.720 --> 02:46:36.960]  false flag on the map if I've done anything it's that and I've made five
[02:46:36.960 --> 02:46:42.560]  films on 9-11 being an inside job and absolutely it was a staged event to
[02:46:42.560 --> 02:46:47.200]  radically re-engineer America bipartisan criminal action we don't know
[02:46:47.200 --> 02:46:51.760]  exactly what happened but we know the official story is a complete fairy tale
[02:46:51.760 --> 02:46:56.280]  and they blew up building seven and it was controlled demolitions and I heard
[02:46:56.280 --> 02:47:00.200]  them on CBS radio say they were gonna blow up building seven and then we found
[02:47:00.200 --> 02:47:04.920]  the videos later years later when they finally archive BBC and CNN from live
[02:47:04.920 --> 02:47:08.200]  they go get ready for the control demolition and then folks said how do
[02:47:08.200 --> 02:47:11.080]  you get ready for control demolition in the middle of this thing we're not
[02:47:11.080 --> 02:47:14.480]  gonna talk about it we didn't blow it up they blew it up they were caught with
[02:47:14.480 --> 02:47:18.080]  their pants down the hijackers were US government agents we don't know they
[02:47:18.080 --> 02:47:21.400]  were triple agents and or what even really happened we just know there's a
[02:47:21.400 --> 02:47:25.560]  cover-up we know enough to put a bunch of people in handcuffs and bring them in
[02:47:25.560 --> 02:47:31.120]  as suspects in this government that I mean is that your point your question or
[02:47:31.120 --> 02:47:35.960]  what you want to ask me you just put an exclamation point on it Bill you're
[02:47:35.960 --> 02:47:39.760]  awesome I appreciate your call again we don't screen your calls just sometimes
[02:47:39.760 --> 02:47:43.480]  it says what you called in about so I was like we'll talk about the purge and
[02:47:43.480 --> 02:47:47.160]  then I was asking John that guy tell you it was about the purge I just want to
[02:47:47.160 --> 02:47:50.480]  hear from the military about the purge because it's finally getting media
[02:47:50.480 --> 02:47:54.120]  attention and I've heard the military is really upset we've had Navy SEALs on
[02:47:54.120 --> 02:47:59.280]  and military police send us videos that have gone viral those have been
[02:47:59.280 --> 02:48:03.760]  reposted in Curt Nimmo's article Obama's unprecedented purge of the US
[02:48:03.760 --> 02:48:08.800]  military accelerates I think we should add the word accelerates to Kurt's
[02:48:08.800 --> 02:48:12.200]  headline because that's what his article is about and we have the proof right
[02:48:12.200 --> 02:48:15.440]  there that's a big deal and it's just funny because usually I get all these
[02:48:15.440 --> 02:48:19.560]  military calls when I'm not looking for them and now I'm not getting any let's
[02:48:19.560 --> 02:48:23.000]  talk to Tim in Maine Tim you're on the air go ahead
[02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:27.080]  good afternoon Alex this is such an honor to talk to you honor to talk to you
[02:48:27.080 --> 02:48:31.360]  brother well listen you you I don't think people really understand the
[02:48:31.360 --> 02:48:35.160]  magnitude of the information that you are providing with your resources ten
[02:48:35.160 --> 02:48:39.480]  years ago I thought this guy he's way off what off base I have followed you and
[02:48:39.480 --> 02:48:43.760]  I am so surprised at how right you are with everything and I and I use your
[02:48:43.760 --> 02:48:49.160]  words I don't believe you I go find out for myself and I am so impressed this
[02:48:49.160 --> 02:48:54.560]  this is very scary times hours and I can tell you that I've been watching what's
[02:48:54.560 --> 02:48:58.280]  been going on I listen to you I do my own homework and I make my own decisions
[02:48:58.280 --> 02:49:03.800]  and this is difficult to believe what's going on now now this the next step with
[02:49:03.800 --> 02:49:07.640]  DHS I've been watching what you're talking about and then I see it in the
[02:49:07.640 --> 02:49:13.160]  news exactly what is going on we have such a large population here that are
[02:49:13.160 --> 02:49:17.080]  that are sheep that are going to go along with it I am scared to death what's
[02:49:17.080 --> 02:49:22.280]  going on with DHS with the next step and they keep throttling it up Alex
[02:49:22.280 --> 02:49:27.160]  they're not going to stop until they have us all in cages they're already
[02:49:27.160 --> 02:49:30.600]  coming out and saying we're not going to let you release a movie unless it's
[02:49:30.600 --> 02:49:35.200]  feminist and gay approve with these certifications the big banks are saying
[02:49:35.200 --> 02:49:38.720]  we're going to I mean it's like putting yellow stars on Jews so they couldn't do
[02:49:38.720 --> 02:49:44.160]  business it's political correctness as a weapon to shut down all their competition
[02:49:44.160 --> 02:49:48.640]  and the term gay and lesbian is just a litmus test to go after conservatives and
[02:49:48.640 --> 02:49:52.480]  libertarians and then you know let us teach your five-year-old how to have
[02:49:52.480 --> 02:49:57.920]  anal sex or you're a bigot and I know we're against pedophilia and and so
[02:49:57.920 --> 02:50:01.800]  they're using political correctness as a license to get their little mitts on
[02:50:01.800 --> 02:50:05.960]  our children and you know folks aren't buying this the digital journal has a
[02:50:05.960 --> 02:50:09.720]  great article out that says op-ed actually asked Watson to do this
[02:50:09.720 --> 02:50:13.360]  article yesterday and he's a great guy he's hadn't done it yet like like like
[02:50:13.360 --> 02:50:19.720]  you know why I think I even said I so we an article like a you know why lax could
[02:50:19.720 --> 02:50:23.000]  be a false flag and then use all the anomalies and issues and that's
[02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:27.080]  basically what this article did showing the history of stage terror why
[02:50:27.080 --> 02:50:30.200]  government stage terror this government's done it before show their
[02:50:30.200 --> 02:50:34.640]  suspects they have a motive to get power arm the TSA the official story doesn't
[02:50:34.640 --> 02:50:40.000]  add up they did the story it says we know they exist we know our government's
[02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:47.200]  done them before so they're a big suspect boom common sense so I'm just
[02:50:47.200 --> 02:50:53.520]  going to have this article posted up on info wars.com this is absolutely

[02:52:41.760 --> 02:52:45.840]  number one item to hoard right now and why supplies are so low or even

[03:00:33.000 --> 03:00:37.960]  the air go ahead hey how are you doing good brother thanks for calling good
[03:00:37.960 --> 03:00:40.760]  hey I wanted to talk to you about that Charleston we have an office that we
[03:00:40.760 --> 03:00:44.840]  call a president right here's my theory Alex with the 9th and 10th amendment
[03:00:44.840 --> 03:00:48.440]  under our bill of rights these acts as bookends right and it gives us the order
[03:00:48.440 --> 03:00:53.040]  that although it may not be said it's up to us to restore order if men choose to
[03:00:53.040 --> 03:00:55.640]  pervert well yeah that's what the Declaration of Independence says no but
[03:00:55.640 --> 03:00:58.760]  that's why they now teach at West Point the Declaration of Independence is a
[03:00:58.760 --> 03:01:03.640]  terrorist document well clearly well my point is here is I was seriously
[03:01:03.640 --> 03:01:08.280]  considering going down myself and arresting Eric Holder for President
[03:01:08.280 --> 03:01:12.600]  Obama by myself the problem that I seem to run into I don't know who would
[03:01:12.600 --> 03:01:16.560]  anybody that would actually charge them well sure no no no they've got the the
[03:01:16.560 --> 03:01:20.160]  major courts the the injustice department which is a terrorist
[03:01:20.160 --> 03:01:23.880]  organization at the top there's plenty of people in the Justice Department I
[03:01:23.880 --> 03:01:27.040]  guarantee you that know all this is true the whole government's not bad I want to
[03:01:27.040 --> 03:01:31.160]  be clear about that it is a coup it is criminal groups and people do like to
[03:01:31.160 --> 03:01:34.520]  try to arrest Carl Roevan stuff that actually has an effect he ends up not
[03:01:34.520 --> 03:01:37.680]  wanting to go to a bunch of countries now and has been indicted in stuff and
[03:01:37.680 --> 03:01:42.360]  same thing with Henry Kissinger you know for stuff he's done and so it's the
[03:01:42.360 --> 03:01:47.720]  same deal is that when Obama comes to town say like he's up in Dallas if you
[03:01:47.720 --> 03:01:50.520]  can get in front of the cameras and with handcuffs and say I'm here to arrest
[03:01:50.520 --> 03:01:54.760]  Obama I'm here to arrest him for you know high crimes and misdemeanors are
[03:01:54.760 --> 03:01:58.120]  letting felons get our personal data with Obamacare you know I'm here to
[03:01:58.120 --> 03:02:04.160]  arrest him for fast and furious that is a good stunt but and just that idea does
[03:02:04.160 --> 03:02:08.960]  move the ball down the road but state legislature should be convened an
[03:02:08.960 --> 03:02:14.660]  emergency session to call for special state prosecutors to move with
[03:02:14.660 --> 03:02:18.600]  investigations and move for state grand juries to indict the president and just
[03:02:18.600 --> 03:02:23.680]  the moral authority of that is something that needs to be done I mean listen
[03:02:23.680 --> 03:02:26.560]  Congress needs to be having investigations about the purge of the
[03:02:26.560 --> 03:02:31.960]  military or hearings about why they say NATO is over our military or why our
[03:02:31.960 --> 03:02:37.160]  government's funding al-Qaeda or fast and furious but they're not are they
[03:02:37.160 --> 03:02:41.040]  unfortunately and that's the point you know who do we go to if the people that
[03:02:41.040 --> 03:02:43.880]  are supposed to hold these crowns accountable won't hold them accountable
[03:02:43.880 --> 03:02:46.960]  well who the heck do we go to I mean you can't just well I mean here's the deal
[03:02:46.960 --> 03:02:50.200]  they're using our tax money against us and for anybody that's running a small
[03:02:50.200 --> 03:02:55.320]  operation or can now I really feel guilty even paying taxes of the Federal
[03:02:55.320 --> 03:02:58.520]  Reserve's I know it's not used around the country but I have to because I'm in
[03:02:58.520 --> 03:03:02.080]  the spotlight run a media operation I mean I've I personally I'm not given
[03:03:02.080 --> 03:03:06.360]  advice it's time though I've believed it would draw consent from the system I
[03:03:06.360 --> 03:03:09.760]  mean because they're gonna taxes to a point where we go bankrupt that's the
[03:03:09.760 --> 03:03:15.240]  plan under Cloward and Piven that's the I mean the architect of Obamacare admits
[03:03:15.240 --> 03:03:22.080]  on Fox it's meant to bankrupt the country so we have it we have a duty now to to
[03:03:22.080 --> 03:03:26.600]  not pay off student loans to big six banks we have a duty I mean I'm not
[03:03:26.600 --> 03:03:31.560]  saying do this is your decision but more and more we you have a duty if you've
[03:03:31.560 --> 03:03:34.880]  not heard me say we need to attack red light cameras until recently I'm not
[03:03:34.880 --> 03:03:38.680]  saying do that I'm just saying sometimes they get hurt sometimes the camera
[03:03:38.680 --> 03:03:42.600]  falls down I mean at a certain point we got to push back a little bit here I
[03:03:42.600 --> 03:03:47.120]  don't want a civil war physical civil war so we better do everything up to that
[03:03:47.120 --> 03:03:52.920]  now to stop that because the last thing I want to do because see I know the
[03:03:52.920 --> 03:03:55.720]  globalists are gonna sit offshore while we all kill each other that I'm really
[03:03:55.720 --> 03:04:01.280]  am sick of them winning we're gonna lose if the we lose when that TSA guy gets
[03:04:01.280 --> 03:04:05.320]  shot because people are mad if you believe that wasn't stage probably was
[03:04:05.320 --> 03:04:10.560]  but regardless we lose that's why they stage stuff because it's not good it's
[03:04:10.560 --> 03:04:17.240]  terrible that makes them look good but no the tyranny so great no amount of
[03:04:17.240 --> 03:04:21.240]  that is gonna put it back together again thank you Evan I gotta go I'm sorry
[03:04:21.240 --> 03:04:26.040]  to Jason and I'm sorry to Simon and Alan and Rashid and others if you call me
[03:04:26.040 --> 03:04:29.200]  back tomorrow I promise I'll go to you we'll push you to the front of the line
[03:04:29.200 --> 03:04:33.840]  tomorrow when we take phone calls if I'm back tomorrow you never know nowadays
[03:04:33.840 --> 03:04:38.520]  man this country is in deep trouble they ship in the drugs that destabilize
[03:04:38.520 --> 03:04:42.600]  things give them an excuse to militarize police then they stage terror attacks
[03:04:42.600 --> 03:04:47.000]  blaming on Muslims or let Muslims do it so that they can then set up a domestic
[03:04:47.000 --> 03:04:51.080]  checkpoint system then they flip it to the tea party and it's very elementary
[03:04:51.080 --> 03:04:54.560]  they said they would always do it that's how I told you I didn't predict all
[03:04:54.560 --> 03:05:19.600]  this it's all public it's all public back tonight 7 o'clock
