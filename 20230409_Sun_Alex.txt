[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.400]  Alright, Scott Ritter is an expert in Soviet Union and war, major Iraq whistleblower, major
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.480]  league persecuted, not the level of Julian Assange, but close, he'll be in studio with
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.200]  us coming up next segment, throughout the hour, very important next hour, but badass
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.840]  Uncle Sam, if he really is badass Uncle Sam, has a band out video channel, goes out and
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.340]  talks to the public every week, does a great job, want to get his take on the trans day
[00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.500]  of vengeance, and I got a whole stack of news I haven't gotten to here, the governor's
[00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.980]  office just calls for violence against anybody that criticizes the trans cult, the left's
[00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:43.740]  up here saying, kill Christians everywhere, so this is what the left's calling for, what
[00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.460]  do you think is coming badass Uncle Sam?
[00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:52.140]  Hey Alex here, this is the badass Uncle Sam, and before I even get there, I just want to
[00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.140]  thank him for saving my life, this is a true thing, last year I was hit by that bio weapon,
[00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.380]  I was in the hospital, they did not expect me to live, and I drove all my supplements
[00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:09.460]  with me, and they said, well, we can't allow you to take those supplements, I said, I,
[00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.780]  you tell me I can't take the supplements, you can take me out of this hospital, well,
[00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:21.140]  I survived obviously, but one of the nurses, and this is a quote, told me, if I had not
[00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:28.540]  taken those supplements, I would not have lived, so I'm telling you folks, these supplements
[00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:35.220]  saved my life, I want to thank you for saving my life, I just made another big order, can't
[00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.220]  wait to get it in.
[00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.740]  Well thanks for the support, I love your work, I didn't know you were sick, sorry I didn't
[00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.700]  know about that, what's your view on the trans cult, their promise to engage in a bunch of
[00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.540]  violence, they've got high level FBI people now warning they think copycat attacks are
[00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:48.540]  about to happen.
[00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.620]  Well, as you know, I'm in the gay capital of the south here in New Orleans, and I'm
[00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:01.340]  going to be putting up a video tomorrow that pretty much amplifies the reaction I get on
[00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.460]  the street here, because I'm on the bullhorn, and I, you know, I'm trying to invite liberals
[00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.380]  over to talk, and one of the things I say over the bullhorn is, could you please explain
[00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:17.180]  to me how helping women by having men compete with women in women's sports, how does that
[00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:23.700]  help women out, so, but I'm telling you nothing, and this includes people that are not even
[00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:30.740]  in RLTGB or whatever they want to call them, just liberals.
[00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:36.220]  They get, they just go off the rails when I bring that question up.
[00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.780]  It's like, can you, you know, I'll say look, I'm not trying to trash trainees, I'm just
[00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.020]  trying to wonder why, well they say we're victims, let us have access to your kids, let
[00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.980]  us do whatever we want, let us be God.
[00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.300]  Indeed, and I just want people to pray for me, because I'm going to be out there this
[00:02:53.300 --> 00:03:00.420]  weekend, and it's going to be the weekend of rage and vengeance, and as I say, every
[00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:07.500]  weekend I encounter these people, every weekend, so I'm sure it's going to be even more pro,
[00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.580]  you know, it's going to be more so this weekend, so if anybody's in the area that want to come
[00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.180]  out and watch my six, hey, come and join me, we'll have some fun out there.
[00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.180]  Where are you going to be this weekend?
[00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.640]  I'm going to be right down there at the, in the French Quarter, right at the beginning
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:25.640]  of the French Market.
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:26.640]  It's a big foot traffic area.
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.580]  Yeah, for people that don't know, I've seen the videos, you've been brutally attacked
[00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.220]  and had to kick some people's asses.
[00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:41.420]  Oh yeah, yeah, I mean, yeah, I mean, it is what it is, I mean, but I'll tell you, people
[00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.540]  always ask me what kind of reaction I get, well, of course, most people ignore you, they
[00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:53.260]  don't want to get involved, but overwhelmingly, and then, I mean, I'm in this liberal cesspool,
[00:03:53.260 --> 00:04:00.340]  I would say I'll get 500 thumbs up before someone shoots me the middle finger, I mean, the support
[00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.820]  No, I mean, I watch your videos almost every week when I get a chance to, and, but man,
[00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:08.180]  I've seen that one guy try to kill you, and you finally beat the hell out of him, but,
[00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.380]  I mean, it's dangerous dealing with these people, and we appreciate you, brother.
[00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.380]  Yeah, well, we got a lawsuit against him in the city, too, coming up, so that's
[00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.380]  Yeah, the cops just sit there.
[00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.380]  Yeah, yeah, he didn't do a darn thing.
[00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.380]  Yeah, yeah, it was strange.
[00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.380]  All right, brother, well, we appreciate you, and glad you got better.
[00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:28.380]  God bless you.
[00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.380]  The biggest thing is we load up on vitamin D and iodine and stuff before you get sick,
[00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.380]  but wow, thank you so much, sir.
[00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.580]  Find Badass Uncle Sam on Bandai Video.
[00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.580]  Remember, all those hundreds of band contributors are only at Bandai Video
[00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:40.580]  because you buy the products and support us.
[00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:41.580]  Thank you.
[00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.580]  All right, talk about a guy who's been talking about the deep state, a smart guy.
[00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.580]  I'm very excited to have Scott Ritter.
[00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.580]  He's been on before many, many years ago via, like, Skype, but I don't think ever in person,
[00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.580]  so Scott Ritter's coming in right now, and we'll continue after that with your phone calls.
[00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:55.580]  Please stay with us.
[00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:03.780]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.780]  I want you all to know something. Alex Jones was right.
[00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.780]  Alex is right about far more than he's wrong.
[00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.780]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.780]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up, or rub it down.
[00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.780]  Alex Jones was right.
[00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:28.980]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:31.980]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for, like, decades.
[00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:35.980]  Alex Jones called this years ago. Years ago.
[00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:39.980]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second.
[00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.980]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.980]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.980]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:52.980]  That's why the globalists hate me, is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.980]  ALEX JONES
[00:05:59.284 --> 00:06:01.284]  You
[00:06:03.036 --> 00:06:13.156]  The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must
[00:06:13.156 --> 00:06:15.156]  be followed.
[00:06:15.156 --> 00:06:20.636]  There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for
[00:06:20.636 --> 00:06:22.956]  launching nuclear weapons to do so.
[00:06:22.956 --> 00:06:29.316]  As president, I will make it clear that the United States will treat cyber attacks just
[00:06:29.316 --> 00:06:30.796]  like any other attack.
[00:06:31.236 --> 00:06:36.756]  We will be ready with serious political, economic, and military responses.
[00:06:36.756 --> 00:06:42.396]  They're voting for peace on planet Earth if they vote for Trump, but if they vote for Hillary,
[00:06:42.396 --> 00:06:43.396]  it's war.
[00:06:43.396 --> 00:06:48.136]  We came, we saw, he died.
[00:06:48.136 --> 00:06:50.356]  With her, you'll end up in World War III.
[00:06:50.356 --> 00:06:54.196]  I want the Iranians to know that if I'm the president, we will attack Iran.
[00:06:54.196 --> 00:06:59.236]  Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria would require us
[00:06:59.236 --> 00:07:00.236]  to go to war.
[00:07:00.676 --> 00:07:02.676]  Against Syria and Russia.
[00:07:03.916 --> 00:07:08.236]  The U.S. military has just raised the threat level to DEFCON 2.
[00:07:08.236 --> 00:07:14.156]  Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is still threatening Russia with military action following unconfirmed
[00:07:14.156 --> 00:07:16.436]  reports of further hacking.
[00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:19.076]  It's like she's not even concerned about the repercussions.
[00:07:19.076 --> 00:07:20.076]  Of course not, because she's-
[00:07:20.076 --> 00:07:21.076]  Hang on, guys.
[00:07:21.076 --> 00:07:22.076]  Look, there's a really loud noise.
[00:07:25.076 --> 00:07:27.516]  Alright, looks like we're having a little bit of technical difficulties.
[00:07:27.516 --> 00:07:29.876]  We'll try to get Leanne back on in a few minutes.
[00:07:30.236 --> 00:07:37.876]  When the president gives the order, it must be followed.
[00:08:00.236 --> 00:08:20.236]  Well, Scott Ritter needs no introduction.
[00:08:20.236 --> 00:08:23.396]  He's a former Marine intelligence officer who served in the former Soviet Union implementing
[00:08:23.396 --> 00:08:27.635]  arms control agreements on the staff of General Normus Horskoff during the Gulf War.
[00:08:28.036 --> 00:08:32.196]  He played a crucial role in the hunt for Iraq's Scud missiles from 91 to 98.
[00:08:32.196 --> 00:08:36.076]  Mr. Ritter served as a chief inspector of the United Nations in Iraq, leading the search
[00:08:36.076 --> 00:08:39.276]  for Iraq's so-called weapons of mass destruction.
[00:08:39.276 --> 00:08:44.076]  Mr. Ritter was a vocal critic of the American decision to go to war in Iraq in 2003.
[00:08:44.076 --> 00:08:48.675]  His new book, Disarmament, the Time of Perestroika, Arms Control, and the End of the Soviet Union
[00:08:48.675 --> 00:08:50.396]  is his ninth.
[00:08:50.396 --> 00:08:54.276]  Real Scott Ritter on Twitter, ScottRitterExtra.com.
[00:08:54.276 --> 00:08:59.556]  We couldn't have a more important, informative, truthful, honorable person with us in studio.
[00:08:59.556 --> 00:09:03.716]  So sir, you're going to have to have the floor here and just tell people about what's happening
[00:09:03.716 --> 00:09:07.076]  in Ukraine, what's happening in Russia, what's happening in the rest of the world and your
[00:09:07.076 --> 00:09:10.876]  view on how we can try to stop what I think is already the beginning of World War III
[00:09:10.876 --> 00:09:12.236]  leading to nuclear confrontation.
[00:09:12.236 --> 00:09:13.236]  So thanks for being here.
[00:09:13.236 --> 00:09:14.556]  Thank you very much for having me.
[00:09:14.556 --> 00:09:15.716]  Look, you're absolutely right.
[00:09:15.716 --> 00:09:17.915]  We couldn't be in a more critical period of time.
[00:09:17.915 --> 00:09:23.316]  But what's important to understand is, like the war in Iraq, this is a war of choice that
[00:09:23.356 --> 00:09:25.556]  we're waging against Russia right now.
[00:09:25.556 --> 00:09:29.756]  And ladies and gentlemen, I don't mean to be too blunt here, we're at war with Russia.
[00:09:29.756 --> 00:09:33.996]  It hasn't turned into a straight up nuclear showdown yet.
[00:09:33.996 --> 00:09:40.596]  But we have made it, we the United States, have made it our objective to achieve the
[00:09:40.596 --> 00:09:43.036]  strategic defeat of Russia.
[00:09:43.036 --> 00:09:45.596]  That's the official policy of the United States.
[00:09:45.596 --> 00:09:49.996]  And if you're Russia and you hear a nuclear power like the United States who's aligned
[00:09:49.996 --> 00:09:58.116]  with a anti-Russian military organization, NATO, saying that their mission is the strategic
[00:09:58.116 --> 00:10:01.436]  defeat of Russia, that means you can't trust the United States.
[00:10:01.436 --> 00:10:06.396]  You have to assume that everything the United States is doing is geared towards your destruction
[00:10:06.396 --> 00:10:09.876]  and it's incumbent upon you to respond accordingly.
[00:10:09.876 --> 00:10:14.276]  People out there are now saying that Russia launched an unprovoked act of aggression against
[00:10:14.276 --> 00:10:17.316]  Ukraine on February 24th of 2022.
[00:10:17.316 --> 00:10:19.236]  That's the furthest thing from the truth.
[00:10:19.236 --> 00:10:24.596]  To accept that, you have to ignore the fact that in 2008, the former U.S. Ambassador to
[00:10:24.596 --> 00:10:28.956]  Russia, current CIA Director William Burns, wrote a memorandum called Net Means Net, No
[00:10:28.956 --> 00:10:34.675]  Means No, establishing what he said were the red lines Russia set about bringing Ukraine
[00:10:34.675 --> 00:10:35.675]  into NATO.
[00:10:35.675 --> 00:10:39.796]  That if we tried to bring Ukraine into NATO, it would provoke a Russian military response.
[00:10:39.796 --> 00:10:45.276]  So we knew later that year when we invited Ukraine into NATO, that we were doing it knowing
[00:10:45.276 --> 00:10:47.516]  Russia would react militarily.
[00:10:47.796 --> 00:10:54.316]  Then in 2014, we conduct a coup against the constitutionally elected government of Viktor
[00:10:54.316 --> 00:11:00.556]  Yanukovych in Ukraine, replace him with the most odious regime possible.
[00:11:00.556 --> 00:11:05.556]  Neo-Nazis, supporters of Adolf Hitler, have come back to life today in Central Europe
[00:11:05.556 --> 00:11:06.556]  and Ukraine.
[00:11:06.556 --> 00:11:08.156]  We put them in power.
[00:11:08.156 --> 00:11:10.396]  There was a war, a conflict.
[00:11:10.396 --> 00:11:15.356]  Russia was ready to defeat them militarily in the fall of 2014.
[00:11:15.356 --> 00:11:20.796]  Then France and Germany intervened, something called the Minsk Accords, a ceasefire agreement
[00:11:20.796 --> 00:11:21.796]  took place.
[00:11:21.796 --> 00:11:24.556]  And for eight years, Russia sought a peaceful outcome.
[00:11:24.556 --> 00:11:28.636]  They sought to get all the parties to implement the Minsk Accords.
[00:11:28.636 --> 00:11:32.915]  We now know that neither Ukraine, France, or Germany took this seriously.
[00:11:32.915 --> 00:11:38.156]  They all admit it was a sham designed to buy time so NATO could train a Ukrainian army
[00:11:38.156 --> 00:11:40.396]  to go to war against Russia.
[00:11:40.396 --> 00:11:42.836]  Russia believed in peace, tried to achieve peace.
[00:11:42.836 --> 00:11:46.596]  In December of 2021, they put two draft peace treaties on the table.
[00:11:46.596 --> 00:11:47.836]  We ignored it.
[00:11:47.836 --> 00:11:51.476]  When they intervened in February, it's because they had no other choice.
[00:11:51.476 --> 00:11:56.675]  The Ukrainian military was shelling civilian areas in the Donbas, killing hundreds of children,
[00:11:56.675 --> 00:11:58.396]  thousands of civilians.
[00:11:58.396 --> 00:12:01.716]  But even after Russia's intervention, they sought a peaceful outcome.
[00:12:01.716 --> 00:12:06.915]  Rather than trying to capture the city, overthrow the government, they wanted negotiations.
[00:12:06.915 --> 00:12:12.636]  And they actually had a negotiated peace settlement ready to sign on 1 April when the United States
[00:12:12.636 --> 00:12:15.435]  and Great Britain intervened and brought an end to that.
[00:12:15.435 --> 00:12:17.036]  That's the war we're in today.
[00:12:17.036 --> 00:12:21.836]  It's a war that Russia's fighting to save the civilian population, the ethnic Russian
[00:12:21.836 --> 00:12:24.836]  civilian population of eastern Ukraine.
[00:12:24.836 --> 00:12:30.236]  It's a war being waged by Ukraine as a proxy of NATO and the United States to undermine,
[00:12:30.236 --> 00:12:33.396]  destroy, and otherwise destabilize Russia.
[00:12:33.396 --> 00:12:39.076]  The consequences of this are that we have a level of nuclear escalation that's unprecedented
[00:12:39.076 --> 00:12:40.076]  in history.
[00:12:40.076 --> 00:12:41.675]  There is no more arms control right now.
[00:12:41.716 --> 00:12:45.915]  The last remaining arms control treaty has been suspended because Russia says, we can't
[00:12:45.915 --> 00:12:50.675]  do business with a nation that wants to inspect our most sensitive facilities.
[00:12:50.675 --> 00:12:54.036]  At the same time, they say, we want to defeat you strategically.
[00:12:54.036 --> 00:12:58.476]  So Russia says, we can't talk to you until you change your strategic outcome.
[00:12:58.476 --> 00:13:01.356]  You have to be willing to talk to us as equals and deal with us.
[00:13:01.356 --> 00:13:04.356]  This treaty expires in February of 2026.
[00:13:04.356 --> 00:13:09.276]  And when that treaty expires, there will be no more arms control at a time when there's
[00:13:09.276 --> 00:13:12.435]  the greatest level of tension between Russia and the United States.
[00:13:12.435 --> 00:13:15.636]  Both sides will be in a new arms race.
[00:13:15.636 --> 00:13:23.076]  Ladies and gentlemen, one mistake, one miscalculation, one Arab judgment, it's all over.
[00:13:23.076 --> 00:13:26.196]  In a nuclear war, there's no such thing as a limited nuclear war.
[00:13:26.196 --> 00:13:27.696]  You can't win a nuclear war.
[00:13:27.696 --> 00:13:29.796]  By all over, I mean, you're all dead.
[00:13:29.796 --> 00:13:34.396]  And that's our future if we don't find a way to get disarmament back on the table.
[00:13:34.396 --> 00:13:38.276]  That's why the 2024 elections are probably one of the most important elections in the
[00:13:38.276 --> 00:13:42.996]  history of the United States, because literally the future of the United States and the world
[00:13:42.996 --> 00:13:43.996]  is on the line.
[00:13:43.996 --> 00:13:45.256]  We elect the wrong person.
[00:13:45.256 --> 00:13:46.675]  We don't get arms control.
[00:13:46.675 --> 00:13:47.675]  We all die.
[00:13:47.675 --> 00:13:49.876]  I'm not an arms treaty expert like you.
[00:13:49.876 --> 00:13:53.675]  You cut your teeth on that and worked on that in decades and accurately said there were
[00:13:53.675 --> 00:13:57.675]  no WMDs in Iraq as a chief U.N. inspector, but we're going to go to break.
[00:13:57.675 --> 00:13:58.675]  But this is a layperson.
[00:13:58.675 --> 00:14:02.996]  I can study the Rand Corporation documents, the Pentagon threat escalation doctrines, and
[00:14:02.996 --> 00:14:05.716]  we're moving right up that threat scale towards nuclear war.
[00:14:05.716 --> 00:14:11.156]  And every like you said, every analyst says once it gets to a point, it goes all the way.
[00:14:11.156 --> 00:14:12.156]  Yes, sir.
[00:14:12.156 --> 00:14:16.116]  And all the way again, I just I don't want to scare people.
[00:14:16.116 --> 00:14:17.915]  You will all die.
[00:14:17.915 --> 00:14:18.915]  It's that blunt.
[00:14:18.915 --> 00:14:24.556]  You cannot survive a nuclear conflict ways between nuclear powers like the United States
[00:14:24.556 --> 00:14:25.596]  and Russia.
[00:14:25.596 --> 00:14:29.836]  Once it happens, all the weapons released, everybody dies.
[00:14:29.836 --> 00:14:35.156]  And even if it stayed to a limited the different numbers I've seen as reactors meltdown, society
[00:14:35.156 --> 00:14:38.756]  breaks down, stock markets crash because the Pentagon's like, oh, we can have a limited
[00:14:38.756 --> 00:14:39.756]  war.
[00:14:39.756 --> 00:14:40.996]  Well, even a limited war will destroy the economy.
[00:14:40.996 --> 00:14:41.996]  Right.
[00:14:41.996 --> 00:14:42.996]  But the Pentagon doesn't understand.
[00:14:42.996 --> 00:14:43.996]  It takes two to tango.
[00:14:43.996 --> 00:14:45.675]  Russia doesn't believe in a limited war.
[00:14:45.675 --> 00:14:47.876]  So we may think we're getting a limited war.
[00:14:47.876 --> 00:14:48.876]  They're coming at us with total.
[00:14:48.876 --> 00:14:52.116]  Well, let's talk about Russian doctrine, because they've got their nuclear forces doing big
[00:14:52.116 --> 00:14:53.116]  drills.
[00:14:53.116 --> 00:14:55.675]  Putin keeps warning nuclear war is imminent.
[00:14:55.675 --> 00:14:58.516]  Scott Ritter's our guest in studio could have a better guess at this time.
[00:14:58.516 --> 00:14:59.516]  Stay with us.
[00:14:59.516 --> 00:15:06.756]  With all the uncertainty in the world today, especially surrounding the pandemic, it's
[00:15:06.756 --> 00:15:12.195]  important to make sure that you protect yourself as well as others around you.
[00:15:12.195 --> 00:15:17.435]  That's why we recommend legally obtaining and carrying a firearm.
[00:15:17.435 --> 00:15:22.756]  As you can see, bullets travel hundreds, if not thousands of feet per second and are able
[00:15:22.756 --> 00:15:28.996]  to neutralize mass assailants while maintaining proper social distancing protocols.
[00:15:28.996 --> 00:15:33.915]  Protect gun owners routinely wash their hands and face after time spent on the range
[00:15:33.915 --> 00:15:39.556]  to prevent exposure to lead as well as transmitting it to other surfaces.
[00:15:39.556 --> 00:15:44.996]  Signs that someone you know may be a legal gun owner include, but are not limited to
[00:15:44.996 --> 00:15:52.195]  positive empowerment, peace of mind and a general sense of respect for themselves and
[00:15:52.195 --> 00:15:53.996]  others around them.
[00:15:53.996 --> 00:15:57.356]  Know your rights and practice responsible gun ownership.
[00:15:59.396 --> 00:16:04.556]  They decided to not not put him in handcuffs, not do a mugshot because they knew that that
[00:16:04.556 --> 00:16:05.556]  would help Trump.
[00:16:05.556 --> 00:16:07.756]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[00:16:07.756 --> 00:16:09.276]  We were waiting for the mugshot.
[00:16:09.276 --> 00:16:10.476]  We learned today they wouldn't have it.
[00:16:10.476 --> 00:16:12.116]  So we've made our own.
[00:16:12.116 --> 00:16:16.836]  And it says political prisoner with an image of President Trump.
[00:16:16.836 --> 00:16:19.276]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[00:16:19.276 --> 00:16:21.836]  It'll be shipping out to you in one week.
[00:16:21.836 --> 00:16:28.036]  Political prisoner with Trump on the front there in a mugshot jail background.
[00:16:28.076 --> 00:16:29.076]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[00:16:29.076 --> 00:16:33.195]  It says InfoWars.com on the back of the shirt.
[00:16:33.195 --> 00:16:34.476]  We also have Alex Jones for president.
[00:16:34.476 --> 00:16:35.836]  No, I'm not running for president.
[00:16:35.836 --> 00:16:38.396]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt.
[00:16:38.396 --> 00:16:39.396]  Red, white and blue.
[00:16:39.396 --> 00:16:40.396]  Alex Jones for president.
[00:16:40.396 --> 00:16:41.396]  24.
[00:16:41.396 --> 00:16:43.636]  It's a fun conversational piece and a limited edition shirt.
[00:16:43.636 --> 00:16:45.476]  Great way to fund the operation.
[00:16:45.476 --> 00:16:54.076]  So get your Alex Jones for president and Trump mugshot shirts at InfoWarsStore.com or by calling
[00:16:54.076 --> 00:16:58.836]  toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:16:58.836 --> 00:17:03.236]  Every time I talk to you, you're either like on the border exposing the cartels and like
[00:17:03.236 --> 00:17:07.036]  coming under fire or you're on the streets of some American city hanging out with drug
[00:17:07.036 --> 00:17:08.196]  addicts and criminals.
[00:17:08.196 --> 00:17:11.396]  And now you've gone to ground zero of a massive chemical spill.
[00:17:11.396 --> 00:17:13.196]  Are you addicted to the danger, Savannah?
[00:17:13.196 --> 00:17:15.116]  Have you ever considered that for a second?
[00:17:15.116 --> 00:17:18.076]  No, I'm addicted to helping my fellow Americans.
[00:17:18.076 --> 00:17:19.716]  I'm addicted to spreading the truth.
[00:17:19.716 --> 00:17:22.396]  And again, you know, I have InfoWars to thank for that.
[00:17:22.396 --> 00:17:26.556]  Looking back on the day, I was able to ask President Donald Trump two questions.
[00:17:26.556 --> 00:17:31.156]  I was so grateful because, you know, I truly was classically trained under Alex Jones and
[00:17:31.156 --> 00:17:32.316]  under the InfoWars team.
[00:17:32.316 --> 00:17:37.996]  I really do credit that as to why I'm able to, you know, get these types of clips because
[00:17:37.996 --> 00:17:42.756]  Alex's whole mentality was, you know, go where the story is, go where the mainstream media
[00:17:42.756 --> 00:17:43.756]  refuses to.
[00:17:43.756 --> 00:17:48.076]  So it's not that I'm addicted to the insanity, I'm just addicted to telling the truth and
[00:17:48.076 --> 00:17:49.836]  helping the American people.
[00:17:49.876 --> 00:17:53.516]  And I really do credit Alex for, you know, really instilling that within me early on
[00:17:53.516 --> 00:17:54.516]  in my career.
[00:17:59.396 --> 00:18:05.396]  Right now, I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to InfoWarsTore.com
[00:18:05.396 --> 00:18:09.196]  and gotten the great products that enrich your life, that empower your immune system
[00:18:09.196 --> 00:18:11.276]  in your body and keep us on air.
[00:18:11.276 --> 00:18:16.636]  I am humbly, hand in hand, talking to the viewers and listeners that have tuned in, many of you
[00:18:16.636 --> 00:18:19.716]  for years and never gone to InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:18:19.836 --> 00:18:25.356]  We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you never actually go to InfoWarsTore.com
[00:18:25.356 --> 00:18:28.276]  and never experienced these great products and never found the operation.
[00:18:28.276 --> 00:18:32.076]  Sure, you share a link, you share an article, you tell folks about the show, that's great
[00:18:32.076 --> 00:18:33.076]  and I thank you.
[00:18:33.076 --> 00:18:37.156]  But we need funds to operate, plus we've got really great products that do amazing things
[00:18:37.156 --> 00:18:41.996]  for people like our CBD oil and our Fizzy Magnesium and our SleepAid and our Nitric Oxide and
[00:18:41.996 --> 00:18:42.996]  our Real Red Pill.
[00:18:42.996 --> 00:18:46.836]  Plus, all of these are really great products that keep us on air, plus you're missing out
[00:18:46.836 --> 00:18:47.836]  on having these products.
[00:18:48.036 --> 00:18:52.996]  Get off the bench, get in the game, step to the plate and go to InfoWarsTore.com right
[00:18:52.996 --> 00:18:57.036]  now and get these great InfoWars products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:18:59.036 --> 00:19:03.276]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, is a historic
[00:19:03.276 --> 00:19:07.596]  book that documents the globalists in their own words, plan for our future, that is the
[00:19:07.596 --> 00:19:08.596]  hellish future.
[00:19:08.596 --> 00:19:12.396]  Now, you'll be always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them,
[00:19:12.396 --> 00:19:16.356]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores,
[00:19:16.356 --> 00:19:20.356]  like Amazon or InfoWarsTore.com, but you will never be able to get another signed copy
[00:19:20.356 --> 00:19:25.276]  of the book after the signed copies we got run out, and there's about 1,000 left of them
[00:19:25.276 --> 00:19:26.276]  right now.
[00:19:26.276 --> 00:19:31.836]  So, get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World, a signed copy at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:19:31.836 --> 00:19:36.076]  There is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air, so you won't
[00:19:36.076 --> 00:19:40.356]  just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know that you helped keep
[00:19:40.356 --> 00:19:41.356]  InfoWars on the air.
[00:19:41.356 --> 00:19:45.116]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned copies,
[00:19:45.436 --> 00:19:50.436]  but I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to InfoWarsTore.com and get a signed
[00:19:50.436 --> 00:19:54.636]  copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate them to the library or get them to
[00:19:54.636 --> 00:19:55.636]  the local school.
[00:19:55.636 --> 00:19:58.636]  This is an InfoWar, I'm counting on you, and thank you for your support.
[00:20:00.636 --> 00:20:07.636]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:22.310]  Well, you talk about one of the original whistleblowers about WMDs and the kind of proto-example of
[00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:23.310]  WikiLeaks.
[00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:28.590]  Scott Ritter, former chief UN weapons inspector, one of the top weapons inspectors over there
[00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:33.470]  in Iraq and saying it was all a lie and being massively persecuted, and you're getting into
[00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:36.670]  where we currently are with Russia and their posture.
[00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:37.670]  I'm not going to play the clip.
[00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:42.750]  I've played it like 30 times, but Biden eight months ago said, you can't ship Abrams tanks
[00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:43.750]  in.
[00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:44.750]  That escalates things.
[00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:45.750]  That goes to World War III.
[00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:46.750]  But now they are.
[00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:47.750]  So what changed?
[00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:51.790]  I played a clip from during the campaign back in 2016, where Hillary said, we will basically
[00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:52.790]  go after Russia.
[00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:53.790]  We will go after Iran.
[00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:56.510]  And the Joint Chiefs of Staff were like, that leads to World War III.
[00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:57.630]  We can't do it.
[00:20:57.630 --> 00:20:58.990]  Now something's changed.
[00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:03.070]  All the old doctrine where the Pentagon knew they couldn't do this has been thrown to the
[00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:07.590]  wayside in just the last eight, nine months very recklessly.
[00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:11.710]  Where do you see this going and what's the viewers and listeners know and how do we stop
[00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:12.710]  it?
[00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:17.190]  Well, the how we stop it part's the hard and we'll do that at the end.
[00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:18.750]  Look, what's changed?
[00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:25.030]  What's changed is that the United States, the Biden administration, like Hillary Clinton,
[00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:28.510]  has no respect for Russia, none whatsoever.
[00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:33.510]  And if you don't respect somebody, then you're ignorant of their realities.
[00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:39.070]  And the reality is, not only is Russia a peer level military opponent, meaning that
[00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:43.430]  they're as good as we are, ladies and gentlemen, I'm not being, look, I'm a former Marine.
[00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:46.550]  And I'm the kind of guy that says you can't beat me in any kind of fight.
[00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:47.550]  Okay?
[00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:51.110]  If I went to war against Russia, I'm convinced my Marines would win.
[00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:54.810]  But it would be a hell of a price, a hell of a fight, because they're that good.
[00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:56.110]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:21:56.110 --> 00:22:00.990]  No nuclear armed power like the United States or Russia can lose a stand up fight against
[00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:04.050]  a peer level opponent because that's existential.
[00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:05.750]  That means that your nation goes away.
[00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:09.870]  That's why we have nuclear weapons to make sure that we don't disappear.
[00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:11.430]  Mutually assured destruction.
[00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:12.430]  Mutually assured destruction.
[00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:18.030]  But we've deviated from that starting in post 9-11 United States.
[00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:22.790]  Back when we viewed Russia as weak, we started talking about preemptive conflict, preemptive
[00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:26.390]  nuclear conflict where we could use nuclear weapons preemptively.
[00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:29.430]  Lots of articles about it's not bad to use nukes.
[00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:32.070]  There's everything bad about using nukes.
[00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:35.230]  Again, this wheel's being reinvented.
[00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:39.870]  Back in the 1960s, we had people like Mr. Wolfstetter and others who believed that we
[00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:41.670]  could fight and win a nuclear war.
[00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:45.750]  Fortunately, smarter people, Richard Nixon, one of them, came out and said, no, we can't.
[00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:49.210]  That's why mutually assured destruction came into being, where we both agreed there's no
[00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:52.470]  reason to fight a nuclear war because if we do, we all die.
[00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:56.110]  But now we have a new generation of people who think, no, wait a minute, because Russia's
[00:22:56.110 --> 00:23:01.390]  weak, we can bully them, we can threaten them with nuclear conflict, and they'll back down.
[00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:04.150]  I'm here to tell you right now, Russia's not weak.
[00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:07.670]  Russia has a nuclear arsenal that's second to none, and they have a doctrine that says
[00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:09.030]  that they are attacked.
[00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:13.030]  This is why I don't believe in limited nuclear war, because it doesn't matter what we believe.
[00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:17.070]  We use one nuclear weapon against Russia, they'll launch everything at us instantly,
[00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:19.150]  and there's nothing we have that can shoot them down.
[00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:20.150]  We will all die.
[00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:22.590]  And Putin has said that's the set default.
[00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:24.870]  Yeah, that's it.
[00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:28.910]  One nuclear weapon used against us, but here's the other default, and this is why the policy
[00:23:28.910 --> 00:23:31.550]  of the Biden administration is so insane.
[00:23:31.550 --> 00:23:32.550]  Just like us.
[00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:37.930]  Imagine if Russia put 500,000 troops in Mexico and said they're going to come in and they're
[00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:43.030]  going to encourage civil unrest in Texas and then they're going to move in and take Texas.
[00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:45.670]  Would we view this as existential in nature, as a threat?
[00:23:45.670 --> 00:23:46.670]  The answer is yes.
[00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:49.590]  Will we use everything in our arsenal to prevent this from happening?
[00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:50.590]  The answer is yes.
[00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:55.270]  So now we go to Ukraine, and we're starting to threaten to take Crimea, the Donbass.
[00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:56.730]  We're going to physically do this.
[00:23:56.730 --> 00:24:00.990]  This is an assault on Russia, just like a force coming out of Mexico.
[00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:07.570]  So why does the whole globalist, neoliberal, neocon crazy train think they can do this?
[00:24:07.570 --> 00:24:09.050]  Because they don't respect Russia.
[00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:10.950]  They don't understand the strength of Russia.
[00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:15.830]  They don't think Russia is serious about this, because Russia has been the adult in the room.
[00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:19.350]  Russia's the most reasonable nation when it comes to foreign policy and expressing
[00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:23.890]  foreign policy out there, and we take that reasonableness as a sign of weakness.
[00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:26.590]  The fact that Russia wanted peace, for instance.
[00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:29.350]  Why would Russia sue for peace unless they were weak?
[00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:32.030]  If Russia was strong, they would never sue for peace.
[00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:35.350]  Ladies and gentlemen, Russia's pretty strong, but they want peace, and that's what we need
[00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:40.310]  to understand, that we can live together in peaceful coexistence with the people if we
[00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:44.110]  just stop talking nonsense, and one of the biggest things we have to stop talking about
[00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:46.630]  is how we can strategically defeat Russia.
[00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:47.630]  We can't.
[00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:51.110]  So Scott, where are we right now in the doomsday clock in reality?
[00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:56.310]  Not just the bulletin in Atomic Scientist, but in your gut, and what are the real trip
[00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:58.950]  wires you see that could bring this to the next level?
[00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:03.590]  I say that we are, you know, they say, what, 90 seconds now is what they put it at.
[00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:05.350]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're a half second away.
[00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:06.350]  We're a millisecond away.
[00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:07.550]  Why do I say that?
[00:25:07.550 --> 00:25:09.310]  Because it takes one mistake.
[00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:10.310]  That's it.
[00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:12.230]  And we make mistakes every single day.
[00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:13.230]  We're all human.
[00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:19.910]  In 1995, the Norwegians fired an atmospheric test rocket that the Russians misinterpreted
[00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:22.390]  as being a Trident missile being fired at them.
[00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:26.110]  It was such a serious event that they put the nuclear football in front of Boris Yeltsin
[00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:29.470]  and said, you have to fire the arsenal right now, we're under attack.
[00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:31.270]  It was a mistake.
[00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:34.030]  Had he pushed the button, none of us would be here.
[00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:35.030]  We can't-
[00:25:35.030 --> 00:25:36.830]  Go back over there, because people don't remember that.
[00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:40.990]  Yeah, in 1995, and again, you know, I joke about this.
[00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:44.590]  I say, when you meet me, shake my hand and buy me a beer, because if it weren't for me
[00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:48.590]  and other weapons inspectors who implemented the INF Treaty that I write about in my book,
[00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:49.990]  you'd all be dead.
[00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:54.150]  And the reason why I say you'd all be dead is because if those weapons existed in 1995,
[00:25:54.150 --> 00:25:58.510]  when that atmospheric test rocket was fired, Boris Yeltsin wouldn't have had 20 minutes
[00:25:58.510 --> 00:25:59.550]  to consider.
[00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:01.110]  He would have had seven minutes.
[00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:04.530]  And then at seven minute time, he would have pushed the button and we'd all be dead.
[00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:08.230]  But because we got rid of those weapons, we affected disarmament.
[00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:11.670]  He had enough time to receive the phone call that said, oops, mistake.
[00:26:11.670 --> 00:26:12.670]  He didn't push the button.
[00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:13.670]  We're alive.
[00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:18.710]  Today, we're talking about getting an environment with the Russians where there's going to be
[00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:19.910]  a mistake made.
[00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:23.370]  But because there is no arms control, there's going to be no time.
[00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:25.750]  The button will be pushed and we will all die.
[00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:28.990]  And now people like Zelensky say, we want nukes.
[00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:31.870]  And other countries in the EU say, give them nukes.
[00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:36.750]  And we know that Ukraine already fired missiles into Poland and instantly blamed Russia.
[00:26:37.270 --> 00:26:39.950]  And even when it came out that it was their own missiles, they still blame Russia and
[00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:41.310]  called for an attack.
[00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:44.070]  Like, I mean, Zelensky isn't crazy.
[00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:46.070]  100 percent.
[00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:50.870]  I can't use that word, bat something crazy.
[00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:53.510]  And he is, he is just spun up.
[00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:54.510]  But you know what?
[00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:56.110]  Here's the scary part.
[00:26:56.110 --> 00:27:00.470]  Zelensky only speaks that which is written by the CIA.
[00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:01.670]  He is a puppet.
[00:27:01.670 --> 00:27:02.670]  He is Pinocchio.
[00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:05.390]  So the CIA is bat crap crazy.
[00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:06.390]  100 percent.
[00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:09.070]  The CIA works for a president who's bat crap crazy.
[00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:10.430]  And that's the problem.
[00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:15.450]  This is why I say the 2024 election is probably the most important election in our history
[00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:19.710]  because this is the election that if it goes the wrong way, we may not.
[00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:20.710]  Let's be clear.
[00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:24.910]  Yesterday he says, you good looking kids, I'm going to take you upstairs and give you
[00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:27.190]  ice cream at a mass shooting press conference.
[00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:30.830]  I mean, it's beyond bizarre.
[00:27:30.830 --> 00:27:34.470]  I can't explain what's going on with the president of the United States other than to say that
[00:27:34.550 --> 00:27:37.910]  he lacks the mental capacity to govern effectively.
[00:27:37.910 --> 00:27:40.770]  And it's a, it's an embarrassment, but it's more than an embarrassment.
[00:27:40.770 --> 00:27:41.770]  It's dangerous.
[00:27:41.770 --> 00:27:42.770]  All right.
[00:27:42.770 --> 00:27:43.770]  I'm going to try to shut up the next 30 minutes.
[00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:44.770]  We come back to long segments.
[00:27:44.770 --> 00:27:45.770]  What do you want to hit?
[00:27:45.770 --> 00:27:50.150]  Scott Ritter, when we come back, I should add your book Disarmament in the Time of Perestroika
[00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:51.150]  is available everywhere.
[00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:55.290]  People go to your website, scottritterxtra.com, you're going to be speaking at the Liberty
[00:27:55.290 --> 00:28:00.630]  Tavern in Elgin, a great place, great barbecue in that area outside Austin tonight.
[00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:01.630]  Yes, sir.
[00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:02.630]  That's where we're going to be doing.
[00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:07.950]  What I'd like to talk about is how you beat, you asked me the question, how can we prevent
[00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:08.950]  this?
[00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:11.550]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have to learn to stop hating Russians.
[00:28:11.550 --> 00:28:14.790]  And when we come back, I'd be like, I'd like to be able to talk to you about how we can
[00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:15.790]  do just that.
[00:28:15.790 --> 00:28:19.990]  Well, even if I was a Russophobe, which I'm not, driving them together with China and
[00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:23.430]  doing all this is not good for America.
[00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:24.430]  Joe Biden knew that.
[00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:26.230]  That's why he joked about it in 1997.
[00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:30.510]  He said, you want to be friends with China, you know, enjoy your senior year.
[00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:31.510]  Well, guess what?
[00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:32.510]  They're friends with China.
[00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:33.510]  That's what he said.
[00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:34.510]  And if that doesn't work, go to Iran.
[00:28:34.510 --> 00:28:35.510]  Well, guess what?
[00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:38.190]  China, Russia, and Iran are all together, and it's not good for the United States.
[00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:40.710]  And Iran's upping attacks?
[00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:43.070]  Iran is up, but again, cause and effect relationship.
[00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:44.150]  Nothing happens in a vacuum.
[00:28:44.150 --> 00:28:46.270]  Why is Iran upping attacks?
[00:28:46.270 --> 00:28:47.630]  Because we're attacking them.
[00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:50.030]  And like you said, we're already in World War III.
[00:28:50.030 --> 00:28:51.030]  We are.
[00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:52.030]  We just haven't acknowledged it yet.
[00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:53.030]  The question is, does it go nuclear?
[00:28:53.030 --> 00:28:54.030]  Yes, sir.
[00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:55.030]  That's the question.
[00:28:55.030 --> 00:28:56.030]  Scott Ritter is our guest.
[00:28:56.030 --> 00:28:57.030]  Back in a few minutes.
[00:28:57.030 --> 00:28:58.030]  Everybody, you know, tune in now.
[00:28:58.030 --> 00:28:59.630]  He's speaking outside Austin tonight.
[00:28:59.630 --> 00:29:06.550]  If Alex Jones runs for president in the Republican Party, he has a chance of winning.
[00:29:06.550 --> 00:29:13.510]  If you just tuned in, you may be noticing I'm wearing an Alex Jones for president 2024
[00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:14.510]  shirt.
[00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:17.630]  I am not seriously planning to run for president.
[00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:21.730]  This is an idea of the crew had to have a triggering shirt, kind of next level Alex
[00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:22.730]  Jones was right.
[00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:27.230]  There's Infowars.com in the back, Alex Jones for president 2024 on the front.
[00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:28.230]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:29.510]  It's made out of really nice fabric.
[00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:34.350]  It's high quality and it is a exclusive shirt to Infowars.com.
[00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:36.150]  And when the shirts are gone, they're gone.
[00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:43.350]  We're doing one run of Alex Jones for president 2024 shirts and we'll have a historic memento.
[00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:47.550]  Be able to spread the word, meet a lot of like minded people and you'll be able to keep
[00:29:47.550 --> 00:29:48.910]  us on the air.
[00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:49.910]  No way.
[00:29:49.910 --> 00:29:50.910]  No way.
[00:29:50.910 --> 00:29:51.910]  That's a bridge too far.
[00:29:51.910 --> 00:29:53.390]  That's no, it can't be.
[00:29:53.390 --> 00:29:56.030]  And I said on national television that he was going to win.
[00:29:56.030 --> 00:30:03.230]  At Infowarsstore.com Infowars, tomorrow's news today.
[00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:04.950]  This is their big move.
[00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:08.730]  So yeah, you say, why doesn't Biden address the disasters in the United States?
[00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:10.510]  He doesn't care.
[00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:11.750]  That's not his job.
[00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:13.490]  He's not the president of the United States.
[00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:17.190]  He's a puppet operating for the globalists.
[00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:21.790]  Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased.
[00:30:21.790 --> 00:30:23.550]  They must be opposed.
[00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:30.670]  Autocrats only understand one word, no, no, no, exactly.
[00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:34.190]  And that's why we say no to your vaccines.
[00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:37.310]  We say no to you shutting down our businesses.
[00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:39.810]  We say no to you taking our firearms.
[00:30:39.810 --> 00:30:42.310]  We say no to you censoring our free speech.
[00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:45.910]  We say no to you selling us out to the World Health Organization.
[00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:48.510]  We say no to you getting us into World War III.

[00:33:00.790 --> 00:33:05.470]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:33:05.470 --> 00:33:06.910]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:08.410 --> 00:33:26.410]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:33:26.410 --> 00:33:27.730]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:33:27.730 --> 00:33:29.730]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:29.730 --> 00:33:35.450]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:43.370]  So there's a real palpable nausea to this for me, and a surrealness to it, that I'm
[00:33:43.370 --> 00:33:47.170]  not a former arms inspector, you know, guy that did peace treaties with the Russians
[00:33:47.170 --> 00:33:51.410]  or any of that, but I've studied history, it's so interesting, and to see all the doctors
[00:33:51.410 --> 00:33:56.010]  we had before that kept us from destroying ourselves being thrown aside by a bunch of
[00:33:56.010 --> 00:34:03.330]  inept people that can barely talk, it has a real bone-chilling effect of being on the
[00:34:03.330 --> 00:34:04.730]  eave of destruction here.
[00:34:04.730 --> 00:34:12.330]  So Scott Ritter of ScottRitterExpert.com, former head UN inspector in Iraq.
[00:34:12.330 --> 00:34:14.530]  The next 30 minutes I'm going to try to really shut up and give you the floor, because you
[00:34:14.530 --> 00:34:17.970]  did a great presentation earlier about where we're at, what's going on, and hopefully ways
[00:34:17.970 --> 00:34:18.970]  to stop this.
[00:34:18.970 --> 00:34:21.210]  Well, thank you very much.
[00:34:21.210 --> 00:34:26.050]  Look, the biggest problem we face today is, of course, nuclear weapons.
[00:34:26.050 --> 00:34:30.650]  And so if we don't find a way to put disarmament first and foremost on the agenda, I'm not
[00:34:30.650 --> 00:34:32.970]  saying that in America there's not a lot of problems.
[00:34:32.970 --> 00:34:34.650]  We know there are.
[00:34:34.690 --> 00:34:38.170]  But what I'm saying is none of those problems matter if none of us are alive.
[00:34:38.170 --> 00:34:41.410]  And the one thing that's going to kill us all is nuclear weapons.
[00:34:41.410 --> 00:34:45.450]  And a nuclear war is all but inevitable if we continue on the current policy track.
[00:34:45.450 --> 00:34:51.930]  And that policy track is one that operates in total disregard for Russia and in total
[00:34:51.930 --> 00:34:54.450]  disregard for the reality of nuclear weapons.
[00:34:54.450 --> 00:34:58.350]  We treat nuclear weapons as if they're some sort of toy, some sort of gimmick.
[00:34:58.350 --> 00:35:04.490]  We actually have a nuclear warhead, the W76-2, the low-yield nuclear warhead that we put
[00:35:05.330 --> 00:35:08.850]  on a Trident missile on an Ohio-class submarine.
[00:35:08.850 --> 00:35:11.050]  It is a usable nuclear weapon.
[00:35:11.050 --> 00:35:14.530]  That term alone should send alarm signals to anybody, because there's no such thing
[00:35:14.530 --> 00:35:16.170]  as a usable nuke.
[00:35:16.170 --> 00:35:21.690]  We have actually practiced in war games firing this nuclear weapon against the Russian target
[00:35:21.690 --> 00:35:26.250]  in a NATO-type scenario, which is exactly, of course, what's going on in Ukraine right
[00:35:26.250 --> 00:35:27.250]  now.
[00:35:27.250 --> 00:35:32.170]  So we have a weapon deployed, designed to be used in the very scenario that we're speaking
[00:35:32.170 --> 00:35:35.690]  of, because we believe that we can escalate to de-escalate.
[00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:39.810]  We can fire a nuclear weapon and get the Russians to back down.
[00:35:39.810 --> 00:35:44.010]  Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, again, what you think about him, I don't care.
[00:35:44.010 --> 00:35:49.090]  But I will tell you this, when he speaks, listen, because what he says, he means.
[00:35:49.090 --> 00:35:50.090]  He doesn't bluff.
[00:35:50.090 --> 00:35:56.610]  And he says, one nuclear weapon used against Russia, all the world will die.
[00:35:56.610 --> 00:36:01.930]  He said, yes, the Russians will go to heaven as martyrs, but you'll be dead.
[00:36:02.690 --> 00:36:03.690]  And that's all that matters.
[00:36:03.690 --> 00:36:07.130]  Russia's not going to allow anybody to use nuclear weapons against them.
[00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:12.090]  Therefore, when we have a nuclear posture that creates the potential for the use of
[00:36:12.090 --> 00:36:14.730]  nuclear weapons, all Americans should be alarmed.
[00:36:14.730 --> 00:36:17.650]  Now, people will tell you that Russia's a threat.
[00:36:17.650 --> 00:36:20.550]  That's an assessment that people should make.
[00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:23.030]  We should determine, is Russia a threat or not a threat?
[00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:25.970]  But it has to be done realistically, like anything.
[00:36:25.970 --> 00:36:30.770]  You can't solve a problem unless you accurately define the problem first, because if you haven't
[00:36:30.770 --> 00:36:34.330]  defined the problem, the solution you're trying to put in place solves nothing.
[00:36:34.330 --> 00:36:39.210]  And right now, we have Russian policies that are focused on Russia that we've defined as
[00:36:39.210 --> 00:36:40.530]  an enemy, a threat.
[00:36:40.530 --> 00:36:43.090]  And the American people accept that as face value.
[00:36:43.090 --> 00:36:45.490]  And again, I'll just say it straight up.
[00:36:45.490 --> 00:36:49.130]  You know, you were told everything about Iraq, about weapons of mass destruction, about Saddam
[00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:51.650]  Hussein wanting to ruin the world, et cetera.
[00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:53.850]  And we believed it because our government told us that.
[00:36:53.850 --> 00:36:55.830]  It all turned out to be a lie.
[00:36:55.830 --> 00:37:00.730]  So why don't we understand that when the government today talks about Russia being a threat,
[00:37:00.730 --> 00:37:02.570]  it's all a lie.
[00:37:02.570 --> 00:37:04.130]  But we are afraid of Russia.
[00:37:04.130 --> 00:37:06.010]  And where does that fear come from?
[00:37:06.010 --> 00:37:07.010]  Ignorance.
[00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:09.210]  We're ignorant about the reality of Russia.
[00:37:09.210 --> 00:37:14.650]  And that's because we have a systemic program of Russophobia, where we teach everybody to
[00:37:14.650 --> 00:37:16.450]  be afraid of Russia.
[00:37:16.450 --> 00:37:19.770]  How many times have you heard, Putin did it, Putin did it, Putin did it, Putin did it?
[00:37:19.770 --> 00:37:22.530]  Oh, I've heard on congressional hearings, Putin gives me orders.
[00:37:22.530 --> 00:37:23.530]  I've never been to Russia.
[00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:25.610]  I'm just sitting here hearing this.
[00:37:25.610 --> 00:37:28.650]  You know it's a fraud when they're accusing you of it.
[00:37:28.650 --> 00:37:29.650]  It's 100%.
[00:37:29.650 --> 00:37:32.090]  Well, you know, Putin is a powerful leader.
[00:37:32.090 --> 00:37:33.290]  He's been around a long time.
[00:37:33.290 --> 00:37:37.730]  And I'm not saying that we should treat him, you know, with disregard.
[00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:39.090]  We shouldn't disregard him.
[00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:41.970]  I'm just saying we need to be honest about it and accurate about it.
[00:37:41.970 --> 00:37:44.730]  Well, just to interrupt briefly, because I want to give you the floor of the expert,
[00:37:44.730 --> 00:37:46.410]  but I've studied World War II and history.
[00:37:46.410 --> 00:37:50.170]  For those who don't know, there were like 65 million Germans at the beginning of World
[00:37:50.170 --> 00:37:51.170]  War II.
[00:37:51.170 --> 00:37:53.330]  There were like 40 million at the end.
[00:37:53.330 --> 00:37:54.770]  There were about 70 million Russians.
[00:37:54.770 --> 00:37:57.330]  There were about 50 million at the end.
[00:37:57.330 --> 00:37:59.570]  Russians lost one third of their population.
[00:37:59.570 --> 00:38:01.850]  They have that in their DNA.
[00:38:01.850 --> 00:38:05.610]  And you can say, oh, look, they're fighting all of NATO and Ukraine, and they're losing
[00:38:05.610 --> 00:38:07.610]  at some level, winning at others.
[00:38:07.610 --> 00:38:11.650]  But to then think you're going to win and beat them themselves, they will go to nuclear
[00:38:11.650 --> 00:38:12.650]  war with us.
[00:38:12.650 --> 00:38:14.210]  That's, they are going to do it.
[00:38:14.210 --> 00:38:18.850]  And people need to understand that Napoleon and Hitler both lost, and we're about to lose
[00:38:18.850 --> 00:38:19.850]  too.
[00:38:19.850 --> 00:38:20.850]  This is insane.
[00:38:20.850 --> 00:38:21.850]  It's 100%.
[00:38:21.850 --> 00:38:25.450]  They lost 27 million people in the Second World War, 27 million people.
[00:38:25.450 --> 00:38:28.850]  You know, today, you know, we talk about the Second World War, talk about the greatest
[00:38:28.850 --> 00:38:29.850]  generation.
[00:38:29.850 --> 00:38:33.610]  When was the last time we held a victory in Europe parade to celebrate the heroes of World
[00:38:33.610 --> 00:38:34.610]  War II?
[00:38:34.610 --> 00:38:35.610]  We don't anymore.
[00:38:35.610 --> 00:38:38.090]  We've forgotten all about them, because that's what we do.
[00:38:38.090 --> 00:38:39.690]  That's Russia's biggest holiday.
[00:38:39.690 --> 00:38:41.490]  May 9th is Victory Day.
[00:38:41.490 --> 00:38:47.010]  And on May 9th, because there's no more World War II veterans, the Russian population goes
[00:38:47.010 --> 00:38:50.730]  to the street in what they call the Immortal Regiment.
[00:38:50.730 --> 00:38:55.290]  They carry photographs of their grandfathers, their fathers, anybody who served, anybody
[00:38:55.290 --> 00:39:00.330]  who serves today, because they truly honor and respect the men and women who sacrificed
[00:39:00.330 --> 00:39:01.330]  everything.
[00:39:01.330 --> 00:39:02.330]  And let that number sink in.
[00:39:02.330 --> 00:39:03.330]  27 million.
[00:39:03.330 --> 00:39:04.330]  27 million.
[00:39:04.330 --> 00:39:09.410]  You know, we lost a little over 300,000 casualties in World War II in both theaters.
[00:39:09.410 --> 00:39:12.410]  They lost 27 million people.
[00:39:12.410 --> 00:39:16.930]  So when people talk about, is Russia serious when they talk about defending themselves,
[00:39:16.930 --> 00:39:20.290]  they're 27 million dead bodies serious.
[00:39:20.290 --> 00:39:21.570]  It's a number that needs to sink in.
[00:39:21.570 --> 00:39:23.130]  That's a scary number.
[00:39:23.130 --> 00:39:24.130]  It's a huge number.
[00:39:24.130 --> 00:39:25.130]  It's a mind-boggling number.
[00:39:25.130 --> 00:39:30.050]  And it's one, when you travel Russia, you can't go into a village without seeing a World
[00:39:30.050 --> 00:39:31.050]  War II memorial.
[00:39:31.050 --> 00:39:33.130]  And it's not the old crumbling memorials.
[00:39:33.130 --> 00:39:36.610]  So that's the thing, is they're culturally ready for major death.
[00:39:36.610 --> 00:39:37.850]  They don't want it, though.
[00:39:37.850 --> 00:39:38.850]  Exactly.
[00:39:38.850 --> 00:39:41.730]  But they understand what's necessary to defend their homeland, and they will do everything
[00:39:41.730 --> 00:39:43.530]  necessary to defend their homeland.
[00:39:43.530 --> 00:39:47.130]  So we have to ask ourselves, why are we threatening their homeland?
[00:39:47.130 --> 00:39:49.090]  What threat does Russia pose against us?
[00:39:49.090 --> 00:39:52.050]  And the answer is, frankly speaking, zero.
[00:39:52.050 --> 00:39:53.050]  No threat whatsoever.
[00:39:53.050 --> 00:39:55.690]  I have four children, and I am fundamentally pissed they're doing this.
[00:39:55.690 --> 00:39:58.050]  I'm so mad at the neocons and the globalists.
[00:39:58.050 --> 00:39:59.690]  I'm so sick of Lindsey Graham.
[00:39:59.690 --> 00:40:01.890]  I'm so sick of Barack Obama.
[00:40:01.890 --> 00:40:04.010]  I am just so sick of the Bushes.
[00:40:04.010 --> 00:40:07.130]  These damn people should be in prison.
[00:40:07.130 --> 00:40:08.130]  Thank you very much.
[00:40:08.130 --> 00:40:13.210]  But nope, we're going to put Julian Assange in prison for telling the truth, for exposing
[00:40:13.210 --> 00:40:14.210]  the lies.
[00:40:14.210 --> 00:40:15.770]  But the war criminals who've got to...
[00:40:15.770 --> 00:40:16.770]  So what do we do to stop it?
[00:40:16.770 --> 00:40:17.770]  We know we're...
[00:40:17.770 --> 00:40:18.770]  I mean, we'll do this.
[00:40:18.770 --> 00:40:19.770]  Next time, we'll do that.
[00:40:19.770 --> 00:40:20.770]  Timeline.
[00:40:20.770 --> 00:40:22.170]  How fast could this war kick off?
[00:40:22.290 --> 00:40:23.290]  Any minute?
[00:40:23.290 --> 00:40:24.290]  This war could happen today.
[00:40:24.290 --> 00:40:25.290]  It could happen tomorrow.
[00:40:25.290 --> 00:40:26.290]  It could happen next week.
[00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:27.450]  It could happen in a year.
[00:40:27.450 --> 00:40:28.450]  It could happen in a year and a half.
[00:40:28.450 --> 00:40:29.450]  We don't know.
[00:40:29.450 --> 00:40:32.730]  What we do know is the conditions are there for a war, and that should...
[00:40:32.730 --> 00:40:35.810]  And NATO has said they're digging in for five years of war.
[00:40:35.810 --> 00:40:36.810]  NATO.
[00:40:36.810 --> 00:40:37.810]  Yep.
[00:40:37.810 --> 00:40:39.210]  I mean, NATO says it.
[00:40:39.210 --> 00:40:40.490]  We'll see if they can afford it.
[00:40:40.490 --> 00:40:41.490]  They're sort of a bankrupt...
[00:40:41.490 --> 00:40:42.490]  They're bankrupt ideologically.
[00:40:42.490 --> 00:40:44.170]  They're bankrupt fiscally.
[00:40:44.170 --> 00:40:46.170]  Who knows what NATO's future is?
[00:40:46.170 --> 00:40:49.930]  But the bottom line is, as long as NATO's part of an American policy that says we seek
[00:40:49.930 --> 00:40:53.290]  the strategic defeat of Russia, then it's a problem.
[00:40:53.290 --> 00:40:59.690]  Well, I know nobody can tell the future, but what do you see happening?
[00:40:59.690 --> 00:41:02.970]  Seventy percent of me says we're all going to die, so go out and get drunk tonight because
[00:41:02.970 --> 00:41:04.370]  you might as well live high.
[00:41:04.370 --> 00:41:05.370]  It's funny.
[00:41:05.370 --> 00:41:06.370]  That's gut level.
[00:41:06.370 --> 00:41:07.370]  I feel like people don't get...
[00:41:07.370 --> 00:41:08.370]  We're on the edge of destruction.
[00:41:08.370 --> 00:41:09.490]  We are literally on...
[00:41:09.490 --> 00:41:12.410]  But I'm also an optimist because, like you, I have two daughters.
[00:41:12.410 --> 00:41:16.170]  I have twin daughters, and I want them to have children, and I want to be able to play
[00:41:16.170 --> 00:41:17.610]  with my grandchildren.
[00:41:18.570 --> 00:41:22.210]  I'd like to believe that they want to be grandparents at some point in their life.
[00:41:22.210 --> 00:41:24.610]  That isn't going to happen if the world doesn't exist.
[00:41:24.610 --> 00:41:27.130]  So we've got to stop being complacent.
[00:41:27.130 --> 00:41:29.850]  We have to stop waiting for somebody else to do something.
[00:41:29.850 --> 00:41:32.170]  Ladies and gentlemen, the onus is on you.
[00:41:32.170 --> 00:41:33.610]  The burden is on you.
[00:41:33.610 --> 00:41:36.930]  You have got to make the decision that you want to live, therefore you have to become
[00:41:36.930 --> 00:41:44.970]  engaged and insist whoever is in power in 2024 has to make arms control the number one
[00:41:44.970 --> 00:41:50.170]  policy objective of the United States, because if we don't bring nuclear weapons under control,
[00:41:50.170 --> 00:41:51.170]  my children are...
[00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:54.210]  And without even making it partisan, I've got big problems with Trump, but he seems better
[00:41:54.210 --> 00:41:55.210]  one in the war.
[00:41:55.210 --> 00:42:00.690]  Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Tulsi Gabbards, I mean, who do you support?
[00:42:00.690 --> 00:42:05.450]  You know, Donald Trump has put a standard out there right now that's unmatched.
[00:42:05.450 --> 00:42:08.170]  I mean, first of all, he's inconsistent.
[00:42:08.170 --> 00:42:10.810]  He's the man that pulled out of my treaty, the INF Treaty.
[00:42:10.810 --> 00:42:11.810]  That's on him.
[00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:13.330]  And I blame him for that.
[00:42:13.330 --> 00:42:16.210]  And he's going to have to explain that to me someday, why he did that.
[00:42:16.210 --> 00:42:18.490]  He pulled out of the Iran nuclear agreement.
[00:42:18.490 --> 00:42:19.490]  That's on him.
[00:42:19.490 --> 00:42:21.290]  He has to explain to me why he did that.
[00:42:21.290 --> 00:42:24.010]  But he's the only guy that sat down with Kim Jong-un.
[00:42:24.010 --> 00:42:28.010]  Had three meetings with Kim Jong-un to see denuclearization, and had Biden picked that
[00:42:28.010 --> 00:42:32.170]  ball up, we wouldn't have North Korean ICBMs aimed at the United States today.
[00:42:32.170 --> 00:42:34.890]  But we do today because Donald Trump had the vision.
[00:42:34.890 --> 00:42:35.890]  All right.
[00:42:35.890 --> 00:42:36.890]  Stay there.
[00:42:36.890 --> 00:42:37.890]  Let's talk about Trump when we come back.
[00:42:37.890 --> 00:42:38.890]  Final segment with Scott Ritter.
[00:42:38.890 --> 00:42:42.450]  He'll be at the Liberty Tree Tavern in Elgin tonight.
[00:42:42.450 --> 00:42:48.290]  You can get his book, Disarmament in the Name of Perestroika, on his website, scottritterextra.com.
[00:42:48.290 --> 00:42:49.650]  Couldn't be a more important topic, folks.
[00:42:49.650 --> 00:42:53.490]  I know the average American doesn't have a passport, thinks of Russia as like the Mars.
[00:42:53.490 --> 00:42:54.490]  No, folks.
[00:42:54.490 --> 00:42:56.490]  Their missiles are seven minutes away.
[00:42:56.490 --> 00:43:02.490]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[00:43:02.490 --> 00:43:08.490]  I want you all to know something.
[00:43:08.490 --> 00:43:10.490]  Alex Jones was right.
[00:43:10.530 --> 00:43:13.530]  Alex is right about far more than is wrong.
[00:43:13.530 --> 00:43:16.530]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[00:43:16.530 --> 00:43:20.530]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down.
[00:43:20.530 --> 00:43:23.530]  Alex Jones was right.
[00:43:23.530 --> 00:43:26.530]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[00:43:26.530 --> 00:43:30.530]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[00:43:30.530 --> 00:43:33.530]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[00:43:33.530 --> 00:43:34.530]  Years ago.
[00:43:34.530 --> 00:43:36.530]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax.
[00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:38.530]  Not for a second.
[00:43:38.570 --> 00:43:41.570]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[00:43:41.570 --> 00:43:43.570]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[00:43:43.570 --> 00:43:46.570]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[00:43:46.570 --> 00:43:48.570]  That's why the globalists hate me.
[00:43:48.570 --> 00:43:51.570]  It's because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[00:43:59.570 --> 00:44:03.570]  I talk a lot about the great successes Infowars has had.
[00:44:03.570 --> 00:44:05.570]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[00:44:05.610 --> 00:44:09.610]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[00:44:09.610 --> 00:44:11.610]  When we talk about the crew at Infowars,
[00:44:11.610 --> 00:44:14.610]  people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[00:44:14.610 --> 00:44:18.610]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[00:44:18.610 --> 00:44:20.610]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer
[00:44:20.610 --> 00:44:23.610]  and the hard work they engage in every day,
[00:44:23.610 --> 00:44:25.610]  five, six, seven days a week,
[00:44:25.610 --> 00:44:27.610]  it's really just incredible.
[00:44:27.610 --> 00:44:29.610]  So for myself and the whole Infowars crew,
[00:44:29.610 --> 00:44:31.610]  I thank you for your past support.
[00:44:31.610 --> 00:44:33.610]  I only encourage you now to realize that
[00:44:33.650 --> 00:44:36.650]  Infowars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[00:44:36.650 --> 00:44:38.650]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us,
[00:44:38.650 --> 00:44:40.650]  and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[00:44:40.650 --> 00:44:43.650]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfowarsStore.com
[00:44:43.650 --> 00:44:45.650]  and you never buy great products
[00:44:45.650 --> 00:44:47.650]  that enrich and empower your life
[00:44:47.650 --> 00:44:49.650]  while at the same time keeping us on air.
[00:44:49.650 --> 00:44:51.650]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners
[00:44:51.650 --> 00:44:53.650]  actually go buy products at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:44:53.650 --> 00:44:55.650]  If just 1% more of you took action
[00:44:55.650 --> 00:44:57.650]  and went to InfowarsStore.com,
[00:44:57.650 --> 00:44:59.650]  our funding problems will be over.
[00:44:59.650 --> 00:45:01.650]  Please take action now.
[00:45:01.690 --> 00:45:03.690]  Take the Infowars
[00:45:03.690 --> 00:45:05.690]  armored truck out
[00:45:05.690 --> 00:45:07.690]  or the Infowars tank as it's so lovingly called.
[00:45:07.690 --> 00:45:09.690]  You came through yesterday
[00:45:09.690 --> 00:45:11.690]  and shopped at InfowarsStore.com
[00:45:11.690 --> 00:45:13.690]  so I'm going to be able to take the truck out.
[00:45:31.690 --> 00:45:58.690]  Infowars
[00:45:58.690 --> 00:46:00.690]  Thousands of former Nazis
[00:46:00.730 --> 00:46:02.730]  went to work for the United States government.
[00:46:02.730 --> 00:46:04.730]  A flying disc has been found
[00:46:04.730 --> 00:46:06.730]  and is now in the possession of the army.
[00:46:06.730 --> 00:46:08.730]  Here is a bulletin from CBS News.
[00:46:08.730 --> 00:46:10.730]  President Kennedy has been shot.
[00:46:10.730 --> 00:46:14.730]  This is a different kind of war.
[00:46:14.730 --> 00:46:16.730]  The USS Liberty
[00:46:16.730 --> 00:46:18.730]  had just been attacked by Israeli jets
[00:46:18.730 --> 00:46:20.730]  and torpedo boats.
[00:46:20.730 --> 00:46:22.730]  The CIA could manipulate the news
[00:46:22.730 --> 00:46:24.730]  in the United States.
[00:46:24.730 --> 00:46:26.730]  They took the babies out of incubators
[00:46:26.730 --> 00:46:28.730]  and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[00:46:28.770 --> 00:46:30.770]  We need to go into the capital.
[00:46:30.770 --> 00:46:32.770]  Stop! Stop! Stop!
[00:46:32.770 --> 00:46:34.770]  You will always have conspiracy theories.
[00:46:34.770 --> 00:46:36.770]  They are nothing but distractions.
[00:46:36.770 --> 00:46:38.770]  You guys censored Harvard educated doctors.
[00:46:38.770 --> 00:46:40.770]  You silenced those voices.
[00:46:40.770 --> 00:46:42.770]  What we want to do in Davos
[00:46:42.770 --> 00:46:44.770]  is push the reset button.
[00:46:44.770 --> 00:46:46.770]  As soon as we start exposing
[00:46:46.770 --> 00:46:48.770]  the Great Reset,
[00:46:48.770 --> 00:46:50.770]  as soon as these globalists
[00:46:50.770 --> 00:46:52.770]  start going to prison.
[00:46:58.770 --> 00:47:00.770]  Leading a frontal assault
[00:47:00.770 --> 00:47:02.770]  on the lies
[00:47:02.770 --> 00:47:04.770]  of the New World Order
[00:47:04.770 --> 00:47:06.770]  it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:18.880]  As we went to break, I made the point that Americans are great people, but they have
[00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:23.760]  the lowest level of passport ownership of any industrialized country.
[00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:29.600]  And people think of Russia as like it's Pluto or something, or it's Mars.
[00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:30.600]  It's not.
[00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:33.600]  Their submarines are off our coast, just a few minutes with nukes.
[00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:39.240]  And they've been very restrained so far, but now their rhetoric is extremely threatening
[00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:43.160]  because NATO is on their border and moving weapons into the area.
[00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:44.160]  This is insanity.
[00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:48.760]  I wanted to play the short, clever plan of the apes, which is a hypothetical, a fictional
[00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:53.560]  by Rod Serling, a great American World War II veteran and patriot about the astronauts
[00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:55.800]  come back through a time warp and think they're on an alien planet.
[00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:56.800]  It's really Earth.
[00:47:56.800 --> 00:48:00.280]  And Charlton Heston learns at the end that he's back in New York City and that everything
[00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:01.720]  was destroyed by a nuclear war.
[00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:02.760]  And here it is.
[00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:59.760]  Oh, my God.
[00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:03.800]  I'm back.
[00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:05.800]  I'm home.
[00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:09.800]  All the time.
[00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:13.800]  We finally, really did it.
[00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:17.800]  You maniacs!
[00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:19.800]  You blew it up!
[00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:21.800]  Oh, damn you!
[00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:27.800]  God damn you all to hell!
[00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:41.800]  Every major analyst, doesn't matter who they are, agrees that it is now a probability we're
[00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:43.800]  going to have a nuclear war, not a chance.
[00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:47.800]  We're in World War III now, sleepwalking in destruction.
[00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:51.800]  Scott Ritter, who's the trailblazer, can only think of one other person who's done more than
[00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:54.800]  him, and that's Julian Assange, trying to stop this.
[00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:56.800]  We've got this segment and one more, sir.
[00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:57.800]  I'm going to try to shut up now.
[00:49:57.840 --> 00:49:59.840]  Any other things you want to warn people about?
[00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:03.840]  Well, again, I just want to emphasize how serious this is.
[00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:05.840]  This is not a joke.
[00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:09.840]  I know a lot of times people come on air and they try to hype things up to get your attention,
[00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:10.840]  etc.
[00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:13.840]  No, this is the end of the world.
[00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:16.840]  That clip right there, thank you for playing that.
[00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:20.840]  Because that's literally our future.
[00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:21.840]  Everything's going to be destroyed.
[00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:26.840]  Anything you plan on being, any future you plan on having, your children, your grandchildren,
[00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:28.880]  they won't be here.
[00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:31.880]  Nuclear war is serious stuff.
[00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:32.880]  How do we stop it?
[00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:33.880]  You asked the question.
[00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:35.880]  We talked about 2024 and we talked about Donald Trump.
[00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:36.880]  You got caught up in the break.
[00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:37.880]  Yeah.
[00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:38.880]  Donald Trump has put a standard out there.
[00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:42.880]  Whatever you think about Donald Trump, let's put that aside for a second.
[00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:46.880]  Because again, we need to stop this rush towards nuclear war.
[00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:51.880]  And when you have a candidate that says not only what he said last time, why can't we be
[00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:52.880]  friends with Russia?
[00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:54.880]  Reflect on that for a second.
[00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:55.880]  People mocked him.
[00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:57.920]  Why can't we be friends with Russia?
[00:50:57.920 --> 00:51:02.920]  Could you imagine that if we had actually followed through on that, where we'd be today?
[00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:05.920]  We wouldn't be on the precipice of a nuclear conflict.
[00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:06.920]  That's for darn sure.
[00:51:06.920 --> 00:51:08.920]  Plus their resources are the biggest in the earth.
[00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:10.920]  It's a bonanza.
[00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:14.920]  Look, if you can't do business with Russia, you can't do business with anybody.
[00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:18.920]  You know, they got a lot of stuff and they want to do business with us.
[00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:23.920]  But we're the ones who shut it all down because, look, we have a military industrial complex
[00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:29.960]  that needs a sense of conflict around the world to justify an $800 billion defense budget.
[00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:32.960]  Russia's been picked as the enemy, even though they don't want to be the enemy.
[00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:34.960]  You know, we're in Texas right now.
[00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:37.960]  There's a great Texan named Van Cliburn.
[00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:38.960]  Study your history.
[00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:39.960]  He plays the piano.
[00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:41.960]  Played the piano.
[00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:46.960]  In 1959, Van Cliburn went to the Soviet Union to enter the Tchaikovsky Musical Festival.
[00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:50.960]  And he played before a record crowd.
[00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:51.960]  He won.
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:55.000]  He played Beethoven and he came in first place.
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:56.000]  They gave him the first place prize.
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:00.000]  In the history of the United States, in New York City, Avenue of the Heroes,
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:04.000]  we put astronauts, we put politicians, we put war heroes.
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:08.000]  Only one musician has ever been given the ticker tape parade.
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:09.000]  That was Van Cliburn.
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:10.000]  Why?
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:15.000]  Because he had the courage to go to the Soviet Union and break down the walls of ignorance
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.000]  and learn to interact with them as people.
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:19.000]  You say, what can we do?
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:21.000]  We all have to become our own Van Cliburn.
[00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:25.040]  We all have to be able to go on a journey where we break through the walls of ignorance,
[00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:29.040]  the walls of fear, to reach out and touch these people.
[00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:31.040]  One of the things I write about in my book is my experience.
[00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:35.040]  Alex, I'm not lying when I tell you, I joined the Marine Corps to kill Russians.
[00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:38.040]  I joined in the 1980s, the Cold War.
[00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:41.040]  My job was to kill Russians and I trained hard to do just that.
[00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:44.040]  But then I got involved in implementation of this treaty
[00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:46.040]  and I got to go over there and work for two and a half years
[00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:47.080]  and I met them.
[00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:52.080]  Their mothers, their fathers, their sisters, their brothers, their uncles, their aunts, their grandparents.
[00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:53.080]  They laugh.
[00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:54.080]  They cry.
[00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:55.080]  They weep.
[00:52:55.080 --> 00:52:56.080]  They chuckle.
[00:52:56.080 --> 00:52:57.080]  They chortle.
[00:52:57.080 --> 00:52:59.080]  They do everything we do because they are us.
[00:52:59.080 --> 00:53:01.080]  They speak a different language.
[00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:06.080]  They have different cultural peculiarities.
[00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:07.080]  We like barbecue.
[00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:09.080]  They like shashlik.
[00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:11.080]  But it's the same thing.
[00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:14.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you took the chance, the opportunity to go out and meet them,
[00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:16.120]  you wouldn't fear them.
[00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:18.120]  You'd love them because they are you.
[00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:20.120]  But U.S. polls show 80% are against the war.
[00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:22.120]  I think Americans know that.
[00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:23.120]  We are.
[00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:25.120]  But now the question is how do you translate that?
[00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:27.120]  Now we come down to, again, Donald Trump.
[00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:28.120]  He's put a standard out there.
[00:53:28.120 --> 00:53:31.120]  If you don't like Donald Trump, embrace the standard.
[00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:35.120]  Say, OK, I'm not going to vote for Trump, but I'm only going to vote for somebody who believes
[00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:36.120]  in what Trump has said.
[00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:37.120]  NATO is bad.
[00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:38.120]  Nuclear weapons are bad.
[00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:41.120]  We need to embark on a policy that embraces arms control.
[00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:42.120]  You mentioned Tulsi Gabbard.
[00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:43.120]  She's a good candidate.
[00:53:43.160 --> 00:53:44.160]  She's a good candidate.
[00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:45.160]  Give her a chance.
[00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:47.160]  Robert Kennedy, a good candidate.
[00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:50.160]  If he announces, give him a chance.
[00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:52.160]  Don't pick on the little stuff.
[00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:54.160]  Think how great it would be with Democrats when they had good candidates again.
[00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:55.160]  They didn't used to be this.
[00:53:55.160 --> 00:53:57.160]  He'd be a wonderful candidate.
[00:53:57.160 --> 00:53:58.160]  I think he'd be an outstanding.
[00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:01.160]  Robert, if you're watching, announce, buddy.
[00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:02.160]  Announce.
[00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:06.160]  Get your name out there so the American people can start considering your platform because
[00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:09.160]  hell, they killed his dad because he was a good guy.
[00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:11.160]  And please don't give anybody.
[00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:12.160]  I'm not saying that.
[00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:13.200]  Robert.
[00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:14.200]  No, I'm just saying he knows.
[00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:15.200]  He knows.
[00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:16.200]  He knows the family history.
[00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:19.200]  The American people will protect you, Robert.
[00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:20.200]  If you announce.
[00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:21.200]  I didn't mean that as like a way for him not to.
[00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:22.200]  I'm just saying.
[00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:23.200]  No, no, I know.
[00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:24.200]  I know.
[00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:25.200]  He knows.
[00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:26.200]  He knows.
[00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:27.200]  He's fully aware of his.
[00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:28.200]  He can tell us all about the deep state.
[00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:29.200]  Right.
[00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:30.200]  And here's the thing about Robert Kennedy.
[00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:33.200]  Because he knows and he still has the courage to run.
[00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:35.200]  That's the kind of guy you want.
[00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:38.200]  The kind of guy that puts country before self.
[00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:42.240]  The kind of guy that says, I'm here for you, not for me.
[00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:44.240]  That's the kind of guy we need.
[00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:46.240]  Kind of gal we need leading our country.
[00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:51.240]  And don't we need peaceful mass protests now for peace and against World War Three?
[00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:53.240]  Alex, I'm glad you brought that up.
[00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:58.240]  In 1982, June 1982, there was a million person march gathering in Central Park, New York
[00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:02.240]  City, that broke the freeze on arms control.
[00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:05.240]  Five years later, we got the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty.
[00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:12.280]  One of my visions is that in June of 2024, we put a million Americans in the street
[00:55:12.280 --> 00:55:17.280]  again to send a signal to every presidential candidate that nuclear disarmament is our
[00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:18.280]  number one objective.
[00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:20.280]  And I hope we could do it.
[00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:24.280]  And I tell you what, if we make it happen, I encourage everybody here to go out in the
[00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:28.280]  streets, whether it's in Austin, Dallas, Houston, come to New York City, go somewhere,
[00:55:28.280 --> 00:55:30.280]  get in the street and send a signal.
[00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:32.280]  And people say, well, demonstrations don't work.
[00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:34.280]  They worked in 1982.
[00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:38.320]  A million people told Ronald Reagan, the ultimate cold warrior, that they believed
[00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:39.320]  in arms control.
[00:55:39.320 --> 00:55:44.320]  And five years later, a man who called the Soviet Union the evil empire, did his own
[00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:45.320]  Van Cliburn.
[00:55:45.320 --> 00:55:46.320]  And that's been a right wing fetish.
[00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:47.320]  Oh, let's have a bunch of nukes.
[00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:48.320]  Well, what about bioweapons?
[00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:51.320]  Oh, you see, the West just made COVID and all this.
[00:55:51.320 --> 00:55:53.320]  And even the former head of the CDC said, we made it.
[00:55:53.320 --> 00:55:55.320]  We need to stop the bioweapons.
[00:55:55.320 --> 00:55:56.320]  We need to stop the nukes.
[00:55:56.320 --> 00:55:57.320]  We need to stop it all.
[00:55:57.320 --> 00:55:58.320]  We need to stop it all.
[00:55:58.320 --> 00:56:00.320]  You're 100 percent correct.
[00:56:00.320 --> 00:56:03.320]  And I think there's really a way to do it if people get serious.
[00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:04.360]  I agree 100 percent.
[00:56:04.360 --> 00:56:06.360]  Look, America is the greatest country on the planet.
[00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:09.360]  I know the foreigners out there get mad when I say it, but I believe it.
[00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:11.360]  Just like you believe your country's great.
[00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:14.360]  If we put our mind to something, there's nothing we can't do.
[00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:20.360]  And there's no more important subject or issue to put your mind to than saving your own lives.
[00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:21.360]  Well, here's another.
[00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:26.360]  Ten years ago or 15 years ago, the San Francisco Chronicle was at a Pentagon briefing
[00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:30.360]  and the Air Force said, we're testing antimatter weapons, but it's classified.
[00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:31.360]  We can't tell you.
[00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:32.400]  We can't tell you.
[00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:34.400]  Well, the numbers I've seen is they've already created stuff.
[00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:38.400]  If you think they came up with atomic bombs in the 40s, imagine what they've got now.
[00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:41.400]  What if we make a weapon that blows the whole solar system up?
[00:56:41.400 --> 00:56:42.400]  We just don't need to make it.
[00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:44.400]  It's got to stop.
[00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:48.400]  And the way you make it stop is to break through the ignorance-based fear
[00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:51.400]  so we no longer feel there's a threat out there worthy of the weapon.
[00:56:51.400 --> 00:56:53.400]  I'm telling you right now, Alex.
[00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:57.400]  It's like they're using TikTok with the Chinese to then set up something 100 times worse.
[00:56:57.400 --> 00:56:58.400]  Have you seen this bill?
[00:56:58.440 --> 00:56:59.440]  Total surveillance.
[00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:00.440]  Total censorship.
[00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:01.440]  Total control.
[00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:04.440]  Ten times worse than Chai Coms in the name of stopping TikTok.
[00:57:04.440 --> 00:57:05.440]  I understand.
[00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:06.440]  Look, it's insanity.
[00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:10.440]  We, the people of the United States of America, in order to form a more perfect union,
[00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:14.440]  have to get off our butts and get out there and start taking action.
[00:57:14.440 --> 00:57:16.440]  No, I was backing up what you're saying.
[00:57:16.440 --> 00:57:18.440]  They're using one threat to make a threat way worse.
[00:57:18.440 --> 00:57:19.440]  100 percent.
[00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:20.440]  100 percent.
[00:57:20.440 --> 00:57:21.440]  And why?
[00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:22.440]  Because we buy it.
[00:57:22.440 --> 00:57:26.440]  Because we sit at home and we go, okay, yes, we're not compliant.
[00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:29.480]  How many Americans, I mean, now I hear everybody say,
[00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:32.480]  Scott, I didn't believe there was weapons of mass destruction.
[00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:35.480]  Okay, but where were you when they were making the case?
[00:57:35.480 --> 00:57:38.480]  Complacency silence is just as bad as believing the lie.
[00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:41.480]  And again, Russia is seven minutes away.
[00:57:41.480 --> 00:57:42.480]  It is not Mars.
[00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:45.480]  We'll be right back with more comments from Scott Renner.
[00:57:45.480 --> 00:57:46.480]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:48.270 --> 00:57:51.270]  There is a war for the future happening right now.
[00:57:51.270 --> 00:57:56.270]  There is a war that will control my destiny, your destiny, our children's destinies.
[00:57:56.270 --> 00:58:01.270]  And that war is something that we can win, but it takes dedication, it takes commitment.

[00:59:40.270 --> 00:59:44.270]  These are great products that really work and are amazing, plus they keep us on air.
[00:59:44.270 --> 00:59:46.270]  So again, please take action.
[00:59:46.270 --> 00:59:50.270]  Go to infowarstore.com today, and I thank you.
[00:59:50.270 --> 00:59:58.270]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:59:58.630 --> 01:00:19.070]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, I'm really excited to have undoubtedly the top legal
[01:00:19.070 --> 01:00:23.310]  scholar in the country joining us in the next segment, Alan Dershowitz, another great legal
[01:00:23.310 --> 01:00:24.310]  eagle.
[01:00:24.310 --> 01:00:25.790]  Robert Barnes is riding shotgun with me today.
[01:00:25.790 --> 01:00:27.390]  In fact, he was going to be hosting today.
[01:00:27.390 --> 01:00:31.750]  I have my own court stuff I have to deal with, but I'm going to push it up to the time I
[01:00:31.750 --> 01:00:35.950]  got to be in court in like an hour to talk to Alan Dershowitz about this historic event
[01:00:35.950 --> 01:00:36.950]  that's just unfolded.
[01:00:36.950 --> 01:00:40.790]  So, Alan Dershowitz is coming up here with us live in five minutes when a couple hundred
[01:00:40.790 --> 01:00:43.150]  radio stations join us after this break.
[01:00:43.150 --> 01:00:46.750]  But Robert Barnes, give us a prelude of some of what you're going to be talking about
[01:00:46.750 --> 01:00:53.150]  after Dershowitz goes, but also just in general of why this is so historic, what we've just
[01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:54.150]  witnessed.
[01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:56.990]  Well, I think as Professor Dershowitz has identified.
[01:00:56.990 --> 01:00:59.990]  This is all unchartered, unparalleled, unprecedented territory.
[01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:03.670]  This is an attempt to make something it goes even worse than that.
[01:01:03.670 --> 01:01:08.550]  It's not only the just open over Berea style political weaponization of our legal criminal
[01:01:08.550 --> 01:01:10.390]  justice process.
[01:01:10.390 --> 01:01:15.150]  It also it does things like define something as a crime that's not a crime.
[01:01:15.150 --> 01:01:19.710]  It ignores statute of limitations that are meant to protect innocent individuals from
[01:01:19.710 --> 01:01:23.230]  wayward, politically motivated prosecutors in part.
[01:01:23.230 --> 01:01:26.790]  It's violation of due process and it's the most selective prosecution.
[01:01:27.590 --> 01:01:30.750]  Maybe at least in the modern history that I can remember, there have been many selective
[01:01:30.750 --> 01:01:34.430]  prosecutions, but this is probably the most abusive and egregious one.
[01:01:34.430 --> 01:01:39.310]  You have a district attorney being elected, campaigning in part on promising to indict
[01:01:39.310 --> 01:01:41.990]  a particular person for an unidentified crime.
[01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:46.310]  I mean, this is just unheard of in American history of the indictment actually occurring.
[01:01:46.310 --> 01:01:50.630]  You've had some people try to misuse their power in this way, abuse their privilege in
[01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:54.030]  this way, but very few have actually gone ahead and done it.
[01:01:54.030 --> 01:01:55.670]  And yet this one has.
[01:01:55.670 --> 01:01:59.390]  And then and now we're going to see how does the justice system handle the bail process?
[01:01:59.390 --> 01:02:04.310]  Do they abuse it to the Eighth Amendment exists for a reason, says no unreasonable bails supposed
[01:02:04.310 --> 01:02:09.110]  to be limited to conditions of release that guarantee appearance at trial, not supposed
[01:02:09.110 --> 01:02:14.850]  to be used to publicly shame or humiliate people, not supposed to be used to politically
[01:02:14.850 --> 01:02:19.950]  embarrass one's political opponents, not supposed to be used to restrict or restrain the freedom
[01:02:19.950 --> 01:02:24.630]  of speech, freedom of association, freedom of press or right to petition one's own government.
[01:02:24.630 --> 01:02:28.510]  And yet we may see examples and illustrations of that here as well.
[01:02:28.510 --> 01:02:34.350]  So all of this is exposing the frailties of our criminal justice process that have mostly
[01:02:34.350 --> 01:02:40.850]  only been exposed in lower profile cases against political dissidents further outside the system.
[01:02:40.850 --> 01:02:44.310]  This is like the Chicago 7 trial on steroids.
[01:02:44.310 --> 01:02:46.650]  It's January 6th on steroid.
[01:02:46.650 --> 01:02:51.930]  It's taking a case that basically should not exist from a criminal proceedings, both because
[01:02:51.930 --> 01:02:56.210]  of who it is that's being targeted, who it is that's targeting him, but also because
[01:02:56.210 --> 01:03:02.570]  of the substantive nature of the claims being made, the charges being leveled and the limitations
[01:03:02.570 --> 01:03:05.410]  that are supposed to be present that are not being present.
[01:03:05.410 --> 01:03:08.050]  So this goes right to the core of a constitutional democracy.
[01:03:08.050 --> 01:03:12.890]  I mean, people around the world are comparing us to a banana republic.
[01:03:12.890 --> 01:03:18.850]  Our global credibility has taken a substantial hit that will never fully come back.
[01:03:19.090 --> 01:03:24.250]  You know, we mock other countries when they try to lock up their political opponents.
[01:03:24.250 --> 01:03:30.450]  There was a kind of a fake documentary made, but a documentary made on behalf of that won
[01:03:30.450 --> 01:03:36.430]  an Oscar for Navalny, who's a very marginal political figure in Russia.
[01:03:36.430 --> 01:03:40.650]  But it won the best Oscar because he had been locked just because he'd been locked up, even
[01:03:40.650 --> 01:03:44.330]  though I think he got no more than like one percent of the vote ever.
[01:03:44.330 --> 01:03:48.890]  Here you have what signal does it send that we're locking up the former president and
[01:03:48.890 --> 01:03:54.210]  leading presidential opponent of the existing incumbent based on completely nonsensical
[01:03:54.210 --> 01:04:00.890]  charges that have no basis in fact, no basis in law, no basis in due process, no basis
[01:04:00.890 --> 01:04:03.530]  in constitutional restraint on the criminal justice process.
[01:04:03.530 --> 01:04:05.090]  It's just extremely reckless.
[01:04:05.090 --> 01:04:06.090]  Stay there.
[01:04:06.090 --> 01:04:07.090]  You're going to ride shotgun with us.
[01:04:07.090 --> 01:04:11.170]  Alan Dersh was really excited about this interview on Twitter, Alan Dersh, and of course, he's
[01:04:11.170 --> 01:04:15.770]  got the new bestselling book, Get Trump, The Threat to Civil Liberties, Due Process, and
[01:04:15.770 --> 01:04:17.530]  Our Constitutional Rule of Law.
[01:04:17.530 --> 01:04:19.930]  Number one New York Times bestselling author from Skyhorse.
[01:04:19.930 --> 01:04:21.850]  Can't wait to get the book.
[01:04:21.850 --> 01:04:26.290]  I've got one being sent to me by Skyhorse that published my book, The Great Reset in
[01:04:26.290 --> 01:04:27.290]  the War for the World.
[01:04:27.290 --> 01:04:28.890]  It went to number one for two months.
[01:04:28.890 --> 01:04:31.530]  Number one in the New York Times, but they would not list it as number one, but number
[01:04:31.530 --> 01:04:33.490]  one on all the other systems.
[01:04:33.490 --> 01:04:35.010]  This is going to go to number one.
[01:04:35.010 --> 01:04:37.250]  Get Trump by Alan Dershowitz.
[01:04:37.250 --> 01:04:38.250]  Perfect timing with this book.
[01:04:38.250 --> 01:04:43.090]  I got to tell you, coming up, we're back in 60 seconds, joining hundreds of radio stations.
[01:04:43.090 --> 01:04:45.610]  Everybody, tell your friends and family, tune in.
[01:04:45.610 --> 01:04:51.410]  You're going to hear from arguably, or not arguably, the top lawyer in the United States
[01:04:51.410 --> 01:04:52.410]  on what's really happening.
[01:04:52.410 --> 01:04:53.410]  Alan Dershowitz, stay with us.
[01:04:53.410 --> 01:05:04.410]  Thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United States government.
[01:05:04.410 --> 01:05:07.930]  A flying disk has been found and is now in the possession of the army.
[01:05:07.930 --> 01:05:10.730]  There is a bulletin from CBS News.
[01:05:10.730 --> 01:05:12.730]  President Kennedy has been shot.
[01:05:12.730 --> 01:05:15.730]  This is a different kind of war.
[01:05:15.730 --> 01:05:20.730]  The USS Liberty had just been attacked by Israeli jets and torpedo boats.
[01:05:20.730 --> 01:05:23.730]  The CIA could manipulate the news in the United States.
[01:05:23.730 --> 01:05:27.730]  They took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[01:05:27.730 --> 01:05:30.730]  It was almost as if it were a plan in quotes.
[01:05:30.730 --> 01:05:31.730]  It just can't end.
[01:05:32.050 --> 01:05:34.050]  We need to go into the Capitol.
[01:05:34.050 --> 01:05:36.050]  Stop! Stop! Stop!
[01:05:36.050 --> 01:05:38.050]  You will always have conspiracy theories.
[01:05:38.050 --> 01:05:40.050]  They are nothing but distractions.
[01:05:40.050 --> 01:05:42.050]  You guys censored Harvard educated doctors.
[01:05:42.050 --> 01:05:44.050]  You silenced those voices.
[01:05:44.050 --> 01:05:48.050]  What we want to do in Davos is push the reset button.
[01:05:48.050 --> 01:05:55.050]  Soon as we start exposing the Great Reset, the sooner these globalists start going to prison.
[01:05:59.490 --> 01:06:18.490]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:18.490 --> 01:06:23.689]  Alright, well I'm excited after many years trying to get him on the show that we've got
[01:06:23.689 --> 01:06:24.689]  him.
[01:06:24.689 --> 01:06:29.450]  I agree with him on about 90% of stuff, disagree about 10% but nobody can deny that Alan Dershowitz
[01:06:29.450 --> 01:06:33.330]  is hands down America's top lawyer.
[01:06:33.330 --> 01:06:36.890]  He's got the new book out, Get Trump, the Threat to Civil Liberties, Due Process, and
[01:06:36.890 --> 01:06:38.529]  our Constitutional Rule of Law.
[01:06:38.529 --> 01:06:40.689]  Alan Dershowitz, number one New York Times bestselling author.
[01:06:40.689 --> 01:06:45.009]  I don't need to introduce him, everybody knows who he is, perfect timing that he was going
[01:06:45.009 --> 01:06:48.209]  to be coming on soon about this book, I've been wanting to get him, and then he's here
[01:06:48.209 --> 01:06:50.330]  today while this is happening.
[01:06:50.330 --> 01:06:54.089]  Robert Barnes is riding shotgun with us as well, he'll have some questions.
[01:06:54.089 --> 01:06:58.250]  So Alan, thank you so much for coming on, everybody wants to hear what you have to say,
[01:06:58.250 --> 01:07:00.850]  you've been worrying about this for a long time, so I'm going to try to give you the
[01:07:00.850 --> 01:07:03.009]  floor here, sir.
[01:07:03.009 --> 01:07:08.089]  Well I predicted this in my book, Get Trump, I knew that these district attorneys and attorney
[01:07:08.089 --> 01:07:12.450]  generals campaigned on the pledge to get Trump.
[01:07:12.450 --> 01:07:18.609]  These are Democratic district attorneys and attorneys general, and now they are prosecuting,
[01:07:18.609 --> 01:07:22.930]  forget about the fact that he's the first former president to be prosecuted, he's the first
[01:07:22.930 --> 01:07:28.490]  presidential candidate to be prosecuted, and he's running against the head Democrat
[01:07:28.490 --> 01:07:32.450]  in the world, obviously, President Joe Biden.
[01:07:32.450 --> 01:07:38.529]  And when a popularly elected Democratic DA swore to get Trump is going after the man
[01:07:38.529 --> 01:07:43.890]  running against essentially his boss, the chief Democrat, he better have a slam dunk
[01:07:43.890 --> 01:07:45.810]  ironclad case.
[01:07:45.810 --> 01:07:50.290]  And I have to tell you, I haven't seen the indictment yet, but based on what I've seen,
[01:07:50.290 --> 01:07:55.649]  this may be the weakest case I've seen in my 60 years of practicing law, so this is
[01:07:55.649 --> 01:08:03.729]  a great danger to American democracy and the rule of law, and I hope that Americans and
[01:08:03.729 --> 01:08:09.689]  people all over the world will read my book, Get Trump, as a way of saying to Bragg, we're
[01:08:09.689 --> 01:08:14.609]  holding you accountable, you may not be held accountable in New York, where everybody votes
[01:08:14.609 --> 01:08:18.769]  against Trump, but we're going to hold you accountable around the country, in front of
[01:08:18.769 --> 01:08:24.450]  bar associations, and in front of the court of public opinion, because what you've done
[01:08:24.450 --> 01:08:28.130]  endangers the rule of law, you know, today it's a Republican Trump, tomorrow it could
[01:08:28.130 --> 01:08:33.809]  be a Democrat, day after tomorrow, it's your Uncle Charlie and your niece, and this involves
[01:08:33.809 --> 01:08:34.809]  all Americans.
[01:08:34.809 --> 01:08:40.170]  I'm a liberal Democrat, I voted against Trump twice, I have no idea who I'll vote for this
[01:08:40.170 --> 01:08:45.730]  next time, but it has nothing to do with politics, it has everything to do with the fact that
[01:08:45.730 --> 01:08:50.410]  the Constitution requires a presumption of innocence, it doesn't allow targeting of
[01:08:50.410 --> 01:08:57.490]  people, and it, you know, Nancy Pelosi announced today that, no, Trump has to prove himself
[01:08:57.490 --> 01:08:58.490]  innocent.
[01:08:58.490 --> 01:08:59.490]  No, no, no, not in America.
[01:08:59.490 --> 01:09:04.730]  In America, an indictment doesn't mean anything, it's just a piece of paper charging somebody
[01:09:04.730 --> 01:09:14.410]  with a president with something, but, and I think every American has to be very concerned
[01:09:14.410 --> 01:09:15.690]  about what happened yesterday.
[01:09:15.690 --> 01:09:20.570]  Well, I'm not a top legal scholar like you, but studying history, this has never been
[01:09:20.570 --> 01:09:26.690]  done before for a reason, why has no political party in our 240 plus year history ever done
[01:09:26.690 --> 01:09:27.690]  this?
[01:09:27.690 --> 01:09:33.490]  Why is this such a constitutional crisis, as basically every analyst is saying?
[01:09:33.490 --> 01:09:38.290]  And as we know, there was a thought, perhaps, to go after a former president named Richard
[01:09:38.290 --> 01:09:43.969]  Nixon, and President Ford did the right thing, and he said, no, we don't do that in America,
[01:09:44.530 --> 01:09:49.929]  and he endangered his own presidential reelection by pardoning Trump, which was the right thing
[01:09:49.929 --> 01:09:50.929]  to do.
[01:09:50.929 --> 01:09:55.769]  I had dinner with President Ford some years after that, and he said that was the most
[01:09:55.769 --> 01:10:02.650]  important and principled thing he did during his presidency, preventing a precedent being
[01:10:02.650 --> 01:10:08.330]  established that you go after former presidents criminally, even though there was very strong
[01:10:08.330 --> 01:10:11.610]  evidence that he had obstructed justice and paid bribes.
[01:10:11.610 --> 01:10:12.610]  Here, there's nothing.
[01:10:12.610 --> 01:10:13.610]  Here, there's nothing.
[01:10:13.610 --> 01:10:17.969]  Here, there's a nondisclosure agreement, thousands of them are written every year.
[01:10:17.969 --> 01:10:24.010]  Nobody in history has ever then put on this corporate form, oh, the reason I paid $130,000
[01:10:24.010 --> 01:10:28.410]  was to make sure my wife and family doesn't learn about the fact that I was accused of
[01:10:28.410 --> 01:10:30.809]  having an adulterous affair with a porn star.
[01:10:30.809 --> 01:10:34.969]  Why would anybody ever pay for a nondisclosure agreement and then disclose it?
[01:10:34.969 --> 01:10:39.969]  So never in history has anybody been indicted for that kind of Mickey Mouse crime, and then
[01:10:39.969 --> 01:10:44.090]  they stitch it together with a federal felony to try to make it a felony.
[01:10:44.090 --> 01:10:46.250]  That's not the way criminal justice should operate.
[01:10:46.250 --> 01:10:51.130]  You know, Thomas Jefferson once said that for a criminal statute to be constitutional
[01:10:51.130 --> 01:10:58.250]  has to be so clear that a person who is reading it while running, while running, could understand
[01:10:58.250 --> 01:10:59.250]  it clearly.
[01:10:59.250 --> 01:11:03.809]  Now, I'm going to read this indictment while sitting with 60 years of experience, and I
[01:11:03.809 --> 01:11:10.730]  can bet you that I will not understand how they could make a state felony out of a fake
[01:11:10.730 --> 01:11:15.929]  misdemeanor and a fake federal felony that nobody else previously wanted to prosecute.
[01:11:15.929 --> 01:11:20.809]  Mr. Darnus, what's taking off your prestigious legal hat and putting on just an American,
[01:11:20.809 --> 01:11:24.290]  a citizen, you know, a historian hat?
[01:11:24.290 --> 01:11:29.370]  Why is the corrupt deep state bureaucracy doing a crazy Hail Mary like this?
[01:11:29.370 --> 01:11:32.690]  I mean, it'd be something if they had something to go after a former president, it'd still
[01:11:32.690 --> 01:11:34.389]  be unprecedented and explosive.
[01:11:34.389 --> 01:11:39.410]  But to do something with basically an unloaded gun, to threaten the world with banana republic
[01:11:39.410 --> 01:11:46.250]  status and not even have the goods, what do you think, just as an American with your gravitas,
[01:11:46.250 --> 01:11:48.250]  why they're this desperate or why they're doing this?
[01:11:48.250 --> 01:11:50.969]  Well, first of all, I don't think you can say they.
[01:11:50.969 --> 01:11:56.370]  This was a decision made by one person, obviously the elected district attorney, and he knows
[01:11:56.370 --> 01:11:58.610]  he can win this case in New York.
[01:11:58.610 --> 01:12:00.730]  Do you remember what happened to me on Martha's Vineyard?
[01:12:00.730 --> 01:12:05.730]  I defended President Trump in front of the United States Senate on constitutional grounds
[01:12:05.730 --> 01:12:07.610]  and I lost all my friends on the vineyard.
[01:12:07.610 --> 01:12:08.889]  My wife lost her friends.
[01:12:08.889 --> 01:12:11.210]  My children lost their friends.
[01:12:11.210 --> 01:12:13.889]  Everybody turned against us because I had exercised my.
[01:12:13.970 --> 01:12:21.650]  If you just multiply that tenfold, that's what would happen to a judge in New York or
[01:12:21.650 --> 01:12:29.410]  a juror in New York who acquitted, who applied justice, actual justice to Donald Trump.
[01:12:29.410 --> 01:12:34.410]  He would never ever again be part of New York life.
[01:12:34.410 --> 01:12:35.410]  He'd be ostracized.
[01:12:35.410 --> 01:12:40.290]  So he's doing it because he's in his own delusional bubbles, what you're saying?
[01:12:40.290 --> 01:12:41.290]  Because he knows he can win.
[01:12:41.290 --> 01:12:43.370]  No, he can win in New York.
[01:12:43.370 --> 01:12:46.530]  That's why the first thing that his lawyers have to do, Trump's lawyers have to do is
[01:12:46.530 --> 01:12:51.290]  move the case out of New York, move to Staten Island, which is just across the river.
[01:12:51.290 --> 01:12:53.970]  But the voting demographics are very different.
[01:12:53.970 --> 01:12:55.470]  Move it to upstate New York.
[01:12:55.470 --> 01:12:59.930]  He cannot get a fair trial in New York City, and that's why Bragg went after him.
[01:12:59.930 --> 01:13:01.090]  Bragg doesn't want to lose this case.
[01:13:01.090 --> 01:13:03.010]  He doesn't care if it's reversed on appeal.
[01:13:03.010 --> 01:13:04.550]  He'll blame it on the judges.
[01:13:04.550 --> 01:13:07.730]  But he doesn't want to lose it in front of a jury, and he probably won't lose it in front
[01:13:07.730 --> 01:13:08.730]  of a jury.
[01:13:09.450 --> 01:13:13.850]  In New York, a grand jury will indict a ham sandwich, but in New York, when the name
[01:13:13.850 --> 01:13:18.610]  of the ham sandwich is Donald Trump, a petty jury will convict him as well.
[01:13:18.610 --> 01:13:23.130]  And even though he has very good lawyers, I think the likelihood that lawyers can persuade
[01:13:23.130 --> 01:13:29.890]  New York jurors to allow Donald Trump to walk away free and run for president and be reelected
[01:13:29.890 --> 01:13:30.890]  is very unlikely.
[01:13:30.890 --> 01:13:35.290]  So you're saying job number one is to move it out of New York City?
[01:13:35.290 --> 01:13:36.850]  Step number one is out of New York City.
[01:13:36.970 --> 01:13:39.890]  Step number two is to apply the statute of limitations.
[01:13:39.890 --> 01:13:42.130]  This all happened seven years ago.
[01:13:42.130 --> 01:13:45.410]  And you know, they say, well, we couldn't have indicted him over the last seven years.
[01:13:45.410 --> 01:13:46.850]  A, we didn't know where he was.
[01:13:46.850 --> 01:13:48.290]  He was in the White House.
[01:13:48.290 --> 01:13:52.530]  And number two, you can't indict him if he's not in New York.
[01:13:52.530 --> 01:13:54.690]  Well, when do you think they indicted him?
[01:13:54.690 --> 01:13:56.570]  They indicted him when he was in Florida.
[01:13:56.570 --> 01:14:00.530]  So the fact that they indicted him when he was outside of New York means they could
[01:14:00.530 --> 01:14:04.810]  have indicted him any day during the seven previous years, and they didn't do it.
[01:14:04.810 --> 01:14:06.850]  And I think they blew the statute of limitations.
[01:14:06.850 --> 01:14:11.810]  Now, they will argue that, no, because he was out of New York, the statute provides
[01:14:11.810 --> 01:14:15.410]  that the statute of limitations holds.
[01:14:15.410 --> 01:14:20.410]  But it's a nonsense argument in light of the fact that they did indict him while he was
[01:14:20.410 --> 01:14:23.050]  outside of New York, something they could have done for years.
[01:14:23.050 --> 01:14:26.650]  The reason they didn't indict him over the last seven years, previous prosecutors looked
[01:14:26.650 --> 01:14:29.250]  at the case and said, there's nothing to it.
[01:14:29.250 --> 01:14:30.530]  We're not going to indict him.
[01:14:30.530 --> 01:14:34.050]  Those were legitimate, neutral prosecutors.
[01:14:34.050 --> 01:14:38.410]  And then you get a partisan political guy, and he says, no, no, no.
[01:14:38.410 --> 01:14:40.690]  The first two years, I said I didn't think there was a case.
[01:14:40.690 --> 01:14:43.410]  In fact, two of his assistants quit over that.
[01:14:43.410 --> 01:14:47.010]  But I don't know, did he get calls from George Soros, from other contributors?
[01:14:47.010 --> 01:14:48.890]  I don't know the answer to that.
[01:14:48.890 --> 01:14:50.730]  But he obviously had pressure put on him.
[01:14:50.730 --> 01:14:51.730]  Yeah, did he get blackmailed?
[01:14:51.730 --> 01:14:54.730]  Well, I don't know anything about that.
[01:14:54.730 --> 01:14:56.170]  I don't know what he'd be blackmailed for.
[01:14:56.170 --> 01:15:01.890]  He seems like an honorable and decent man and a good lawyer, and he had a good reputation.
[01:15:02.010 --> 01:15:06.490]  You know, when you're caught up in the political winds and you're in New York City where nobody
[01:15:06.490 --> 01:15:12.610]  has anything good to say about Donald Trump, I don't mean nobody, but people, voters, don't.
[01:15:12.610 --> 01:15:16.330]  If you wear a MAGA hat in New York City, you know, you're going to get hit by a bike or
[01:15:16.330 --> 01:15:19.890]  you're going to get, you know, attacked and physically attacked.
[01:15:19.890 --> 01:15:21.890]  Sure, Alan, stay right there.
[01:15:21.890 --> 01:15:23.450]  We got to go to break the book.
[01:15:23.450 --> 01:15:24.770]  Get Trump available everywhere.
[01:15:24.770 --> 01:15:25.770]  Skyhorse Publishing.
[01:15:25.770 --> 01:15:26.770]  We're going to come back.
[01:15:26.770 --> 01:15:27.970]  But I think you misunderstood me.
[01:15:27.970 --> 01:15:31.530]  I was getting to your point earlier of they can try this in New York, the Court of Public
[01:15:31.530 --> 01:15:32.770]  Opinions against him.
[01:15:32.770 --> 01:15:36.930]  I was asking in general, I understand the pressure in New York, why they're not thinking
[01:15:36.930 --> 01:15:40.930]  outside of just Manhattan that you brought up when you first came on.
[01:15:40.930 --> 01:15:45.730]  I mean, the fact that this is going to make Trump explode in popularity, then I guess
[01:15:45.730 --> 01:15:48.210]  we're just guessing at why they would do something so reckless.
[01:15:48.210 --> 01:15:51.410]  Alan Dershowitz, our guest, riding shotgun is Robert Barnes.
[01:15:51.410 --> 01:15:52.410]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:15:52.410 --> 01:15:54.010]  Everybody, you know, tune in now.
[01:15:54.010 --> 01:15:55.010]  This is historic.
[01:15:55.010 --> 01:15:55.890]  This is important.
[01:16:01.570 --> 01:16:03.730]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:16:03.730 --> 01:16:05.450]  This is their big move.
[01:16:05.450 --> 01:16:09.250]  So yeah, you say, why doesn't Biden address the disasters in the United States?
[01:16:09.250 --> 01:16:11.010]  He doesn't care.
[01:16:11.010 --> 01:16:12.250]  That's not his job.
[01:16:12.250 --> 01:16:14.010]  He's not the president of the United States.
[01:16:14.010 --> 01:16:17.650]  He's a puppet operating for the globalists.
[01:16:17.650 --> 01:16:22.290]  Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased.
[01:16:22.290 --> 01:16:23.290]  They must be opposed.
[01:16:23.290 --> 01:16:26.210]  And that's who autocrats only understand.
[01:16:26.210 --> 01:16:31.170]  One word, no, no, no, exactly.
[01:16:31.170 --> 01:16:34.690]  And that's why we say no to your vaccines.
[01:16:34.690 --> 01:16:37.810]  We say no to you shutting down our businesses.
[01:16:37.810 --> 01:16:40.290]  We say no to you taking our firearms.
[01:16:40.290 --> 01:16:42.810]  We say no to you censoring our free speech.
[01:16:42.810 --> 01:16:46.410]  We say no to you selling us out to the World Health Organization.
[01:16:46.410 --> 01:16:49.010]  We say no to you getting us into World War Three.
[01:16:49.010 --> 01:16:50.010]  You're right.
[01:16:50.010 --> 01:16:52.610]  We stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden.
[01:16:52.610 --> 01:16:54.410]  And we say no.
[01:16:54.410 --> 01:16:59.570]  And we say no to your war.
[01:16:59.570 --> 01:17:02.210]  There is a war for the future happening right now.
[01:17:02.210 --> 01:17:07.090]  There is a war that will control my destiny, your destiny, our children's destinies.
[01:17:07.090 --> 01:17:09.530]  And that war is something that we can win.
[01:17:09.530 --> 01:17:11.090]  But it takes dedication.
[01:17:11.090 --> 01:17:12.450]  It takes commitment.

[01:17:17.330 --> 01:17:23.490]  that will enrich and empower your life while keeping us on air at the very same time.

[01:17:47.130 --> 01:17:50.530]  But you've never taken the step to go to InfoWarStore.
[01:17:50.530 --> 01:17:53.330]  These are great products that really work and are amazing.

[01:18:00.050 --> 01:18:07.290]  If Alex Jones runs for president in the Republican Party, he has a chance of winning.
[01:18:07.290 --> 01:18:14.010]  If you just tuned in, you may be noticing I'm wearing an Alex Jones for president 2024
[01:18:14.010 --> 01:18:15.010]  shirt.
[01:18:15.010 --> 01:18:18.050]  I am not seriously planning to run for president.
[01:18:18.050 --> 01:18:22.170]  This is an idea of the crew had to have a triggering shirt, kind of next level Alex
[01:18:22.170 --> 01:18:23.170]  Jones was right.
[01:18:23.290 --> 01:18:27.690]  There's InfoWarStore.com in the back, Alex Jones for president 2024 on the front.
[01:18:27.690 --> 01:18:28.690]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[01:18:28.690 --> 01:18:29.970]  It's made out of really nice fabric.
[01:18:29.970 --> 01:18:31.330]  It's high quality.
[01:18:31.330 --> 01:18:34.770]  And it is a exclusive shirt to InfoWarStore.com.
[01:18:34.770 --> 01:18:36.610]  And when the shirts are gone, they're gone.
[01:18:36.610 --> 01:18:42.330]  We're doing one run of Alex Jones for president 2024 shirts.
[01:18:42.330 --> 01:18:46.010]  And we'll have a historic memento, be able to spread the word, meet a lot of like minded
[01:18:46.010 --> 01:18:49.370]  people and you'll be able to keep us on the air.
[01:18:49.370 --> 01:18:50.370]  No way.
[01:18:50.370 --> 01:18:51.370]  No way.
[01:18:51.370 --> 01:18:52.370]  That's a bridge too far.
[01:18:52.570 --> 01:18:53.810]  No, it can't be.
[01:18:53.810 --> 01:18:56.490]  And I said on national television that he was going to win.
[01:18:56.490 --> 01:18:59.370]  At InfoWarStore.com.
[01:18:59.370 --> 01:19:04.170]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mugshot because
[01:19:04.170 --> 01:19:05.650]  they knew that that would help Trump.
[01:19:05.650 --> 01:19:07.970]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[01:19:07.970 --> 01:19:09.470]  We were waiting for the mugshot.
[01:19:09.470 --> 01:19:10.690]  We learned today they wouldn't have it.
[01:19:10.690 --> 01:19:11.890]  So we've made our own.
[01:19:11.890 --> 01:19:17.010]  And it says political prisoner with an image of President Trump.
[01:19:17.010 --> 01:19:19.490]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[01:19:19.490 --> 01:19:22.050]  It'll be shipping out to you in one week.
[01:19:22.730 --> 01:19:28.250]  Political prisoner with Trump on the front there in a mugshot jail background.
[01:19:28.250 --> 01:19:29.250]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[01:19:29.250 --> 01:19:33.410]  It says InfoWars.com on the back of the shirt.
[01:19:33.410 --> 01:19:34.730]  We also have Alex Jones for president.
[01:19:34.730 --> 01:19:36.050]  No, I'm not running for president.
[01:19:36.050 --> 01:19:39.330]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt, red, white and blue.
[01:19:39.330 --> 01:19:41.210]  Alex Jones for president 2024.
[01:19:41.210 --> 01:19:43.850]  It's a fun conversational piece and a limited edition shirt.
[01:19:43.850 --> 01:19:45.650]  Great way to fund the operation.
[01:19:45.650 --> 01:19:53.850]  So get your Alex Jones for president and Trump mugshot shirts at InfoWars.com or by
[01:19:53.850 --> 01:19:59.850]  calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:19:59.850 --> 01:20:04.570]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:20:04.570 --> 01:20:06.010]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:20.360]  All right, welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, live Friday edition.
[01:20:20.360 --> 01:20:24.240]  We have the top lawyer in the country, hands down, Alan Dershowitz, with a new book, Get
[01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:25.240]  Trump.
[01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:26.240]  Skyhorse Publishing.
[01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:31.600]  And Robert Barnes is riding shotgun with us, another successful, well-known lawyer, who's
[01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:33.560]  going to have some of his own questions as well.
[01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:37.600]  So you heard my point earlier, but I don't want to belabor that.
[01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:42.040]  All I'm getting at is we're seeing a massive backlash, and we know the feds, going to your
[01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:48.640]  point, did not indict Trump on these same, as you say, non-issue Mickey Mouse garbage.
[01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:54.920]  So I guess I'm trying to just read minds here, but I just don't see how such an obviously
[01:20:54.920 --> 01:20:59.360]  explosive decision was made for the first time in U.S. history, and I think we can probably
[01:20:59.360 --> 01:21:03.520]  chalk it up just to the bubble that he's in in New York City.
[01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:08.600]  But how do you see this as a citizen unfolding, and I'd like you to get into all the other
[01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:11.160]  facets you'd like to, Mr. Dershowitz.
[01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:14.200]  Well, I don't think it's necessarily just the bubble.
[01:21:14.200 --> 01:21:16.200]  I think he wants to be re-elected.
[01:21:16.200 --> 01:21:17.200]  He made a promise.
[01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:22.920]  He promised he would get Trump, and if he doesn't get Trump, he loses his re-election.
[01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:24.400]  He has gotten contributions.
[01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:29.120]  We know, reportedly, he got a half a million dollars from George Soros, and whether he
[01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:34.520]  got a call from Soros or just anticipated that Soros might cut back on his contributions
[01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:40.000]  if he doesn't do it, this can't be based on objective legal standards.
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:45.200]  Nobody else would ever be indicted for these kinds of absurd non-crimes.
[01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:48.160]  So plainly, he succumbed to pressure.
[01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:54.200]  He was pressured by his two former assistant district attorneys, one of whom wrote a book,
[01:21:54.200 --> 01:21:59.480]  saying that they ought to go after Trump, but he resisted that pressure initially, and
[01:21:59.480 --> 01:22:01.080]  then he succumbed to it.
[01:22:01.080 --> 01:22:08.040]  So I don't know whether he got pressured from other people as well, but this is not a righteous,
[01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:13.120]  objective, neutral application of the law and the facts.
[01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:14.880]  This is something very different.
[01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:17.080]  Keep an open mind until you see the indictment.
[01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:19.680]  Remember, the indictment hasn't been leaked.
[01:22:19.680 --> 01:22:22.120]  The fact of the indictment has been leaked.
[01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:27.000]  And by the way, the district attorney Bragg should be investigating who leaked it.
[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:28.880]  It's in his building.
[01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:30.240]  It's under his nose.
[01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:31.880]  It's in his watch.
[01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:34.280]  And is he investigating who made the leak?
[01:22:34.280 --> 01:22:40.960]  A leak in New York by grand jurors or by members of Bragg's staff constitutes a class E felony
[01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:43.560]  subject to a year to five years in prison.
[01:22:43.560 --> 01:22:48.080]  So I think it's important to know whether Bragg is in fact investigating this leak.
[01:22:48.080 --> 01:22:49.080]  Wow.
[01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:50.760]  Again, you're the legal scholar.
[01:22:50.760 --> 01:22:53.200]  I'd like you to go wherever you want here.
[01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:55.840]  But just briefly bringing in Barnes here, he'll be interviewing and coming up in the
[01:22:55.840 --> 01:22:56.840]  next few segments.
[01:22:56.840 --> 01:23:00.840]  Robert, you got Alan Dershowitz here with the case of the, not the century.
[01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:06.400]  This is the case, I mean, in U.S. history, everybody's admitting it.
[01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:07.520]  What should I be asking Dershowitz?
[01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:08.520]  I'm glad you're here.
[01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:09.520]  Yeah.
[01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:10.520]  Yeah.
[01:23:10.520 --> 01:23:15.280]  Professor, can you describe for people, I know the courts have sadly not meaningfully
[01:23:15.280 --> 01:23:20.360]  enforced it in my view, but that there is a limit on prosecutorial discretion in the
[01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:25.800]  Constitution colloquially known as selective prosecution under the First Amendment and
[01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:29.400]  forcible through the 14th Amendment against the states.
[01:23:29.400 --> 01:23:33.860]  Do you think President Trump has a grounds to bring a motion to dismiss for selective
[01:23:33.860 --> 01:23:34.860]  prosecution?
[01:23:34.860 --> 01:23:39.580]  And can you explain to folks out there what that is and what that entails and that our
[01:23:39.580 --> 01:23:44.160]  Constitution does in fact have limits on this kind of excess of prosecutorial discretion?
[01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:48.560]  Oh, there's no question that there are constitutional limits.
[01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:50.680]  Selective prosecution is a hard case to make.
[01:23:50.680 --> 01:23:55.120]  This one is so obvious that any court should see through it.
[01:23:55.120 --> 01:24:00.320]  Nobody has ever been prosecuted or will ever be prosecuted in the future for doing anything
[01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:01.320]  like this.
[01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:05.720]  If the indictment is what we think it is, we're not absolutely positive.
[01:24:05.720 --> 01:24:07.380]  So we have to wait and see.
[01:24:07.380 --> 01:24:10.480]  There are also other limitations, ethical limitations.
[01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:17.160]  For example, a prosecutor can't put a witness on the stand who he knows or reasonably suspects
[01:24:17.160 --> 01:24:18.880]  may be lying.
[01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:25.360]  And Michael Cohen, my God, is there, if the word liar appears in the dictionary, Michael
[01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:31.600]  Cohen is, I mean, he's the man who has lied to his lawyers, lied to the federal authorities,
[01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:32.600]  lied to state authorities.
[01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:36.120]  And I'll tell you a recent interesting vignette involving me.
[01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:38.760]  So his lawyers have now said, oh yeah, he was a liar in the past.
[01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:39.760]  He lied to everybody.
[01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:44.360]  But suddenly God has come down to him, lightning has struck, and he's suddenly turned into
[01:24:44.360 --> 01:24:45.720]  a complete truth teller.
[01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:51.920]  Well, two days ago, he did a tweet about me, which constituted a defamatory lie.
[01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:56.680]  He suggested that I was on Jeffrey Epstein's island with underage girls.
[01:24:56.680 --> 01:24:58.640]  Obviously, that never happened.
[01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:03.560]  The one person who accused me is now recanted and basically said she may have mistaken me
[01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:05.200]  for somebody else.
[01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:06.560]  Nobody has ever accused me.
[01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:09.240]  Even she never accused me of being on Epstein's island.
[01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:12.520]  Well, you're not on the flight logs and no one has ever said they saw you other than
[01:25:12.520 --> 01:25:14.520]  one person.
[01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:16.920]  But Michael Cohen decided to lie about me.
[01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:18.240]  And I'm going to sue him.
[01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:21.000]  And so this will be something that can be used in cross-examining.
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:22.760]  Oh, I'm sorry to interrupt.
[01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:23.760]  Start over.
[01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:24.760]  You're going to sue Michael Cohen.
[01:25:24.760 --> 01:25:25.760]  That's big news.
[01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:26.760]  Please tell us.
[01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:27.920]  For defamation.
[01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:31.800]  And then the question that if he takes the witness stand, he'll be asked, you say you
[01:25:31.800 --> 01:25:35.240]  started telling the truth, but you just lied about Alan Dershowitz.
[01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:37.240]  You know he wasn't on Epstein's island.
[01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:39.800]  You know he's never had sex with an underage girl.
[01:25:39.800 --> 01:25:42.560]  You just got mad at him because he called you a liar.
[01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:44.000]  So you made up a story about him.
[01:25:44.480 --> 01:25:45.480]  So you're still lying.
[01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:46.480]  Right.
[01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:47.480]  How is he going to get around that?
[01:25:47.480 --> 01:25:51.920]  So I don't think that Bragg can really put Michael Cohen on the witness stand.
[01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:58.200]  If he does, he really subjects his bar card to some kind of a sanction.
[01:25:58.200 --> 01:26:04.080]  Lawyers have to only put witnesses on the stand who they honestly believe are going
[01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:05.120]  to tell the truth.
[01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:08.620]  That's part of the sacred obligation of a lawyer.
[01:26:08.620 --> 01:26:11.160]  Something I've complied with for 60 years.
[01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:13.960]  Sometimes my clients don't like it when I say, no, I'm not putting you on the witness
[01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:14.960]  stand.
[01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:19.320]  I cannot credibly believe that you're necessarily going to tell the whole truth.
[01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:24.080]  And so Bragg has to be applying an even higher standard as a prosecutor.
[01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:26.040]  So he has really two alternatives.
[01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:31.920]  One, he can risk his bar card by putting Cohen on the witness stand, which would be a mistake.
[01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:35.120]  Or he can try to make the case around Cohen.
[01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:40.720]  Use people other than Cohen to try to prove what Cohen would otherwise approve.
[01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:42.120]  He may try to do that.
[01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:48.440]  But I suspect Cohen will be called as a witness, will be devastated on cross-examination, and
[01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:51.800]  then there'll be questions about Bragg's ethics.
[01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:52.800]  Wow.
[01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:55.520]  Barnes, that was a great question.
[01:26:55.520 --> 01:26:56.520]  Give us another one.
[01:26:56.520 --> 01:26:57.520]  Yeah.
[01:26:57.520 --> 01:27:01.680]  In the same capacity, you mentioned that there are limitations on a grand jury.
[01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:05.320]  Even though the U.S. Supreme Court, in my view, has watered those down.
[01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:11.280]  But one of them that still exists is a prosecutor cannot knowingly suborn perjury or things
[01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:12.440]  like that.
[01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:16.240]  Do you think there's the possibility that perjured testimony may have occurred in front
[01:27:16.240 --> 01:27:19.360]  of this grand jury, including by Cohen?
[01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:20.480]  I do think so.
[01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:22.840]  And I think it was also suppression of evidence.
[01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:27.760]  Remember that Costello was not called as a witness, Costello, who was Cohen's lawyer.
[01:27:27.760 --> 01:27:29.320]  He was not called as a witness.
[01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:33.320]  Obviously, Bragg wanted to keep him from the jury.
[01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:34.320]  But he volunteered.
[01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:38.560]  And he essentially burst into the grand jury room and said, you're going to have to listen
[01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:39.560]  to me.
[01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:44.360]  And then he testified that the hundreds of emails that he had sent to the D.A. to show
[01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:47.000]  to the grand jury were never shown to the grand jury.
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:52.720]  So I think there'll be a motion as well for suppression of exculpatory evidence in front
[01:27:52.720 --> 01:27:54.220]  of the grand jury.
[01:27:54.220 --> 01:28:00.360]  And we'll see whether or not there's also suppression of evidence under the Brady principle
[01:28:00.360 --> 01:28:04.240]  that should have been turned over and should be turned over to the defense.
[01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:09.600]  This is only the beginning of what will be, as you say, a very monumental case.
[01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:13.600]  When I think of the cases in American history, and I've written a book about that, America
[01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:18.040]  on Trial, going through all the great cases in American history, this comes close to the
[01:28:18.040 --> 01:28:22.400]  trial of Aaron Burr, the former vice president of the United States who was put on trial
[01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:29.720]  by Jefferson for treason and defended himself, mostly himself he defended.
[01:28:29.720 --> 01:28:32.440]  And hold on, Alan Dershowitz, longer segment coming up.
[01:28:32.760 --> 01:28:34.360]  We're going to come right back with you and Robert Barnes.
[01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:36.680]  I want to hear about the Burr case.
[01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:38.720]  Is this the biggest case ever?
[01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:41.680]  And then we'll also just talk about, in general, the timing.
[01:28:41.680 --> 01:28:46.920]  Roger Stone was asking earlier, if I would ask you and Barnes about the timing of how
[01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:50.080]  this goes, the election.
[01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:51.080]  Can Trump pardon himself?
[01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:52.080]  Obviously not.
[01:28:52.080 --> 01:28:53.080]  It's a local case.
[01:28:53.080 --> 01:28:55.560]  So how does how do you see that unfolding?
[01:28:55.560 --> 01:28:57.480]  We'll be right back with Alan Dershowitz.
[01:28:58.480 --> 01:29:03.400]  Every time I talk to you, you're either like on the border exposing the cartels and like
[01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:07.240]  coming under fire, or you're on the streets of some American city hanging out with drug
[01:29:07.240 --> 01:29:08.360]  addicts and criminals.
[01:29:08.360 --> 01:29:11.600]  And now you've gone to ground zero of a massive chemical spill.
[01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:13.400]  Are you addicted to the danger, Savannah?
[01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:15.360]  Have you ever considered that for a second?
[01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:18.240]  No, I'm addicted to helping my fellow Americans.
[01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:19.920]  I'm addicted to spreading the truth.
[01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:22.640]  And again, you know, I have info words to thank for that.
[01:29:22.640 --> 01:29:26.720]  Looking back on the day, I was able to ask President Donald Trump two questions.
[01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:31.360]  I was so grateful because, you know, I truly was classically trained under Alex Jones and
[01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:32.560]  under the InfoWars team.
[01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:37.600]  And I really do credit that as to why I'm able to, you know, get these types of clips,
[01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:42.640]  because Alex's whole mentality was, you know, go where the story is, go where the mainstream
[01:29:42.640 --> 01:29:44.120]  media refuses to.
[01:29:44.120 --> 01:29:46.360]  So it's not that I'm addicted to the insanity.
[01:29:46.360 --> 01:29:49.760]  I'm just addicted to telling the truth and helping the American people.
[01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:53.760]  And I really do credit Alex for, you know, really instilling that within me early on
[01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:54.400]  in my career.
[01:29:56.720 --> 01:30:01.800]  There is a war for the future happening right now.
[01:30:01.800 --> 01:30:06.680]  There is a war that will control my destiny, your destiny, our children's destinies.
[01:30:06.680 --> 01:30:09.080]  And that war is something that we can win.
[01:30:09.080 --> 01:30:10.680]  But it takes dedication.
[01:30:10.680 --> 01:30:12.040]  It takes commitment.
[01:30:12.040 --> 01:30:16.720]  That's why I asked listeners respectively to go to InfoWarsStore.com and buy great products
[01:30:16.720 --> 01:30:22.960]  that will enrich and empower your life while keeping us on air at the very same time.

[01:30:42.480 --> 01:30:44.760]  And a lot of you have never shopped at InfoWarsStore.
[01:30:44.760 --> 01:30:47.880]  You've been watching for years, you've been listening for years, but you've never taken
[01:30:47.880 --> 01:30:50.160]  the step to go to InfoWarsStore.
[01:30:50.160 --> 01:30:54.280]  These are great products that really work and are amazing, plus they keep us on air.

[01:31:03.280 --> 01:31:08.480]  I don't think anybody can deny it, and it is because of listeners and viewers supporting
[01:31:08.480 --> 01:31:09.480]  us.
[01:31:09.480 --> 01:31:14.920]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:17.920]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:22.000]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in
[01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:27.320]  every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[01:31:27.320 --> 01:31:30.480]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[01:31:30.480 --> 01:31:36.640]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[01:31:36.640 --> 01:31:39.840]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[01:31:39.840 --> 01:31:44.720]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great
[01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:48.560]  products that enrich and empower your life, while at the same time keeping us on air.
[01:31:48.560 --> 01:31:52.960]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:31:52.960 --> 01:31:57.120]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsStore.com, our funding problems
[01:31:57.120 --> 01:31:58.120]  will be over.
[01:31:58.120 --> 01:31:59.560]  Please take action now.
[01:31:59.560 --> 01:32:07.600]  I intend to take the InfoWars armored truck out, or the InfoWars tank, as it's so lovingly
[01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:08.600]  called.
[01:32:08.600 --> 01:32:12.480]  You came through yesterday and shopped at InfoWarsStore.com, so I'm going to be able to take the truck out.
[01:43:14.720 --> 01:43:15.720]  I'm going to be able to take the tank out.
[01:43:15.720 --> 01:43:16.720]  I'm going to be able to take the tank out.
[01:43:45.720 --> 01:43:53.960]  So get your Alex Jones for President and Trump mugshot shirts at InfoWarsStore.com or by
[01:43:53.960 --> 01:43:54.960]  calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:43:54.960 --> 01:43:55.960]  Thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United States government.
[01:43:55.960 --> 01:43:56.960]  A flying disk has been found and is now in the possession of the Army.
[01:43:56.960 --> 01:43:57.960]  Here is a bulletin from CBS News.
[01:43:57.960 --> 01:43:58.960]  President Kennedy has been shot.
[01:43:58.960 --> 01:43:59.960]  This is a different kind of war.
[01:43:59.960 --> 01:44:19.960]  The U.S.S. Liberty had just been attacked by Israeli jets and torpedo guns.
[01:44:19.960 --> 01:44:22.960]  The CIA could manipulate the news in the United States.
[01:44:22.960 --> 01:44:27.960]  They took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[01:44:27.960 --> 01:44:28.960]  It was as if it were a plan imposed.
[01:44:28.960 --> 01:44:29.960]  It just happened.
[01:44:29.960 --> 01:44:30.960]  We need to go into the Capitol.
[01:44:30.960 --> 01:44:31.960]  Stop!
[01:44:31.960 --> 01:44:32.960]  Stop!
[01:44:32.960 --> 01:44:33.960]  Stop!
[01:44:33.960 --> 01:44:34.960]  You will always have conspiracy theories.
[01:44:34.960 --> 01:44:35.960]  They are nothing but distractions.
[01:44:35.960 --> 01:44:36.960]  You guys censored Harvard educated doctors.
[01:44:36.960 --> 01:44:37.960]  You silenced those voices.
[01:44:37.960 --> 01:44:38.960]  What we want to do in Davos is push the reset button.
[01:44:38.960 --> 01:44:39.960]  As soon as we start exposing the Great Reset, the sooner these globalists start going to
[01:44:58.960 --> 01:45:04.960]  Right now, I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to InfoWarsTore.com

[01:46:59.960 --> 01:47:05.960]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:07.600 --> 01:47:21.320]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, Robert Barnes here guest hosting with the one and
[01:47:21.320 --> 01:47:28.640]  only the inimitable Professor Alan Dershowitz, the greatest living constitutional lawyer
[01:47:28.640 --> 01:47:34.760]  in our time on matters of criminal law, civil law and political arena as well, has managed
[01:47:34.760 --> 01:47:39.360]  to cover all three in his lifetime, a rare someone that I would like to emulate over
[01:47:39.360 --> 01:47:43.320]  my legal career if I get the good fortune to do so.
[01:47:43.320 --> 01:47:45.800]  Professor Dershowitz, what about the timing?
[01:47:45.800 --> 01:47:49.680]  You know, there's a right to, the public has a right to a speedy trial, Trump has a right
[01:47:49.680 --> 01:47:55.040]  to a speedy trial, but it may not be in the interest of justice to have a two speedy trial
[01:47:55.040 --> 01:47:56.520]  in this case.
[01:47:56.520 --> 01:48:02.120]  What do you think the timing is if the case actually ultimately proceeds to a jury trial,
[01:48:02.120 --> 01:48:05.800]  if it gets passed, motions to dismiss and things of that nature?
[01:48:05.800 --> 01:48:10.640]  What do you think the timing will be of an actual jury trial in this case?
[01:48:10.640 --> 01:48:15.000]  Hard to believe that there could be a jury trial in this case in this calendar year.
[01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:19.880]  I would think that will occur during the election year, which will make things even
[01:48:19.880 --> 01:48:21.760]  more difficult.
[01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:24.080]  But the timing was up to Bragg.
[01:48:24.080 --> 01:48:29.320]  I think, I think the speedy trial and statute of limitations issues have already expired.
[01:48:30.320 --> 01:48:33.000]  I mean, these events occurred seven years ago.
[01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:36.480]  Can he get a fair trial based on the passage of time?
[01:48:36.480 --> 01:48:41.560]  And don't statutes of limitations have to be enforced fairly?
[01:48:41.560 --> 01:48:47.120]  But I do think that with motions, with the possible appeals that could be made of motions,
[01:48:47.120 --> 01:48:53.280]  that we're probably thinking about 2024.
[01:48:53.280 --> 01:49:00.160]  In terms of the issues concerning the political weaponization and selective prosecution, does
[01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:06.560]  this potentially open the door to Republican prosecutors and say some small county somewhere
[01:49:06.560 --> 01:49:11.080]  in the country deciding, well, we'll indict Hillary Clinton now, we'll indict, you know,
[01:49:11.080 --> 01:49:16.080]  we'll find something to indict Barack Obama on, we'll indict Hunter Biden, we'll indict
[01:49:16.080 --> 01:49:17.680]  Joe Biden.
[01:49:17.680 --> 01:49:21.680]  What is the risk of that, that that door has now been opened by this prosecution?
[01:49:22.480 --> 01:49:24.600]  Oh, I think the risk is considerable.
[01:49:24.600 --> 01:49:31.880]  In America, we have seen over and over again tit for tat politics and anything the Democrats
[01:49:31.880 --> 01:49:35.640]  do, the Republicans do and vice versa.
[01:49:35.640 --> 01:49:43.000]  And I do think that we will see more political charges and we'll see the bar reduced.
[01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:49.600]  It used to be the case that you understand that if a person is running for office, you
[01:49:49.600 --> 01:49:54.080]  must have a very high bar to prosecute, it has to be a clear case.
[01:49:54.080 --> 01:49:58.680]  This if the indictment is what we think it is, we'll have violated that rule and lowered
[01:49:58.680 --> 01:49:59.680]  the bar.
[01:49:59.680 --> 01:50:07.320]  And that lowering of the bar will apply to Republicans, to Democrats and for everybody.
[01:50:07.320 --> 01:50:10.260]  And this is a case that endangers all of our freedoms.
[01:50:10.260 --> 01:50:15.640]  If you can bring a criminal case on the basis of this kind of flimsy evidence in law, that
[01:50:15.640 --> 01:50:17.160]  means nobody is safe.
[01:50:17.160 --> 01:50:22.520]  Judge Jackson once said, excuse me, that any prosecutor can rummage through the statute
[01:50:22.520 --> 01:50:26.160]  books and find something to pin on somebody.
[01:50:26.160 --> 01:50:28.520]  And that's not the way American law should apply.
[01:50:28.520 --> 01:50:33.160]  And that rule, too, has been violated by yesterday's actions.
[01:50:33.160 --> 01:50:37.280]  Yet very much feels like a Berea prosecution.
[01:50:37.280 --> 01:50:39.640]  Show me the man and I'll find you the crime.
[01:50:39.640 --> 01:50:43.160]  One thing that's always struck out, you know, stood out to me throughout this process is
[01:50:43.200 --> 01:50:47.640]  you identify in your book, get Trump and have talked about being problematic from the get
[01:50:47.640 --> 01:50:52.720]  go is usually sometimes when you have a high profile political person saying they're going
[01:50:52.720 --> 01:50:57.880]  to go after somebody, it's for something that's already happened in a clear criminal context
[01:50:57.880 --> 01:51:01.800]  like, oh, I'm going to go prosecute Enron or I'm going to go prosecute the white collar
[01:51:01.800 --> 01:51:02.800]  or whatever.
[01:51:02.800 --> 01:51:03.800]  I rarely see.
[01:51:03.800 --> 01:51:05.400]  I'm going to go prosecute that guy.
[01:51:05.400 --> 01:51:08.280]  I'm not sure what yet, but I'm just going to go get that guy.
[01:51:08.280 --> 01:51:11.800]  You know, the old famous Berea statement to Stalin, show me the man and I'll find you
[01:51:11.800 --> 01:51:12.800]  the crime.
[01:51:13.440 --> 01:51:18.240]  The to some degree, to what degree does this raise issues of due process, that if if we
[01:51:18.240 --> 01:51:22.520]  see the indictment and we see laws being applied in ways that could not have been really on
[01:51:22.520 --> 01:51:27.140]  fair notice of most people, as you pointed out very articulately at the beginning, nondisclosure
[01:51:27.140 --> 01:51:28.640]  agreements are done all the time.
[01:51:28.640 --> 01:51:32.160]  Nobody puts them in their public disclosure later or their internal documents.
[01:51:32.160 --> 01:51:36.440]  Oh, by the way, here's my hush money payment that defeats the whole purpose of a nondisclosure
[01:51:36.440 --> 01:51:37.440]  agreement.
[01:51:37.440 --> 01:51:40.980]  Now, all of a sudden, all those people could be criminally prosecuted all across America.
[01:51:40.980 --> 01:51:44.940]  How much is there an issue of fair notice and due process that might come up in these
[01:51:44.940 --> 01:51:46.380]  proceedings as well?
[01:51:46.380 --> 01:51:50.100]  There's no question there is an issue of fair notice.
[01:51:50.100 --> 01:51:52.460]  There is an issue of what the law calls lenity.
[01:51:52.460 --> 01:51:58.080]  When you have ambiguous statutes, they have to be resolved in favor of the defendant.
[01:51:58.080 --> 01:52:05.620]  It all goes into the concept of targeting of get Trump of due process violations of
[01:52:05.620 --> 01:52:07.420]  selective prosecution.
[01:52:07.420 --> 01:52:09.460]  All of these will be raised.
[01:52:09.460 --> 01:52:14.620]  Some of them are harder than others to get a judicial relief on them, but they are all
[01:52:14.620 --> 01:52:17.700]  part of also the court of public opinion.
[01:52:17.700 --> 01:52:22.700]  For example, the government's going to argue the statute of limitations didn't get told
[01:52:22.700 --> 01:52:27.460]  because he was out of the state, meaning you couldn't indict him if he was in Washington,
[01:52:27.460 --> 01:52:30.320]  D.C., but they indicted him when he was out of the state.
[01:52:30.320 --> 01:52:34.540]  So that gives the lie to the notion that they couldn't have indicted him any day over the
[01:52:34.540 --> 01:52:35.540]  past seven years.
[01:52:35.540 --> 01:52:41.820]  Statute of limitations of misdemeanors, two years, felony five years, those are long expired.
[01:52:41.820 --> 01:52:47.420]  Why didn't they indict him while he was outside of the state or even while he was in the state,
[01:52:47.420 --> 01:52:49.540]  which he came to from time to time?
[01:52:49.540 --> 01:52:51.140]  And the reason is obvious.
[01:52:51.140 --> 01:52:53.740]  Prosecutors looked at the case and they said there's nothing here.
[01:52:53.740 --> 01:52:58.580]  And so they didn't indict him and now they decided to change that seven years later.
[01:52:58.580 --> 01:53:03.900]  That should not survive a statute of limitations scrutiny, but it might because the New York
[01:53:04.260 --> 01:53:07.980]  Court of Appeals had a weird, weird decision about how you count the days being out of
[01:53:07.980 --> 01:53:09.020]  the state.
[01:53:09.020 --> 01:53:13.740]  But I don't think that's consistent with what the statute of limitations, which was enacted
[01:53:13.740 --> 01:53:17.340]  by the legislature, had in mind.
[01:53:17.340 --> 01:53:20.860]  And can you explain for folks that the statute of limitations isn't just like some little
[01:53:20.860 --> 01:53:22.420]  procedural aspect?
[01:53:22.420 --> 01:53:25.940]  Sometimes we hear, you know, technicalities and people use that excuse for how criminal
[01:53:25.940 --> 01:53:28.700]  defendants escape as they view justice.
[01:53:28.940 --> 01:53:32.980]  In fact, these are constitutional rights and liberties meant to impose.
[01:53:32.980 --> 01:53:37.020]  Fair notice is a critical component of what statute of limitations is all about.
[01:53:37.020 --> 01:53:41.740]  And the rule of lenity, as you mentioned, is about protecting against the defendant
[01:53:41.740 --> 01:53:45.780]  being wrongfully prosecuted in a way they couldn't fairly anticipate and how we interpret
[01:53:45.780 --> 01:53:47.220]  the laws.
[01:53:47.220 --> 01:53:50.660]  Could you remind folks that, you know, what other people call technicalities are the core
[01:53:50.660 --> 01:53:52.980]  to constitutional liberty in America?
[01:53:52.980 --> 01:53:58.500]  Well, my life has been a life of trying to impose what other people think are technicalities
[01:53:58.500 --> 01:54:04.100]  and I think are the essence of what makes America the greatest democracy in the world,
[01:54:04.100 --> 01:54:08.660]  that we have rules of law and those rules of law have to be enforced fairly.
[01:54:08.660 --> 01:54:12.140]  And equally, in statutes of limitations, a part of them, look, we're seeing a challenge
[01:54:12.140 --> 01:54:13.460]  to statute of limitations.
[01:54:13.460 --> 01:54:19.460]  The MeToo movement got many states to eliminate statutes of limitations for rape and other
[01:54:19.460 --> 01:54:20.460]  sexual crimes.
[01:54:20.460 --> 01:54:27.060]  And that has created major problems because memories disappear, witnesses disappear.
[01:54:27.060 --> 01:54:29.940]  And statutes of limitations have to be taken seriously.
[01:54:29.940 --> 01:54:36.620]  And I don't think any crime other than perhaps murder should be prosecuted beyond a certain
[01:54:36.620 --> 01:54:40.780]  period of time, five years, something like that.
[01:54:40.780 --> 01:54:46.140]  But they certainly shouldn't be extended after the statute of limitations has expired.
[01:54:46.140 --> 01:54:48.540]  The Supreme Court has said that would be unconstitutional.
[01:54:48.540 --> 01:54:54.940]  So there is a constitutional dimension to statute of limitations.
[01:54:54.940 --> 01:54:55.940]  Have you been surprised?
[01:54:55.940 --> 01:54:59.740]  I've been surprised to some degree that many of my friends on the left, particular but
[01:54:59.740 --> 01:55:04.980]  not limited to it, within the legal world have, in my view, abandoned a lot of their
[01:55:04.980 --> 01:55:10.460]  principles either because of political pressure or because of just like Trump derangement syndrome
[01:55:10.460 --> 01:55:11.940]  and the rest.
[01:55:11.940 --> 01:55:14.300]  Have you been surprised at seeing that?
[01:55:14.300 --> 01:55:18.820]  And are you, while you predicted it and get Trump and forecast this is where the world
[01:55:18.820 --> 01:55:22.420]  was going, are you still surprised that we're actually here?
[01:55:22.420 --> 01:55:23.420]  We're to this point?
[01:55:23.420 --> 01:55:24.420]  I am.
[01:55:24.420 --> 01:55:25.420]  I'm disappointed.
[01:55:25.900 --> 01:55:33.980]  In my previous book, The Price of Principle, I talked about how so many civil libertarians,
[01:55:33.980 --> 01:55:39.340]  people like my former colleague Lawrence Tribe and the ACLU are prepared to give up on the
[01:55:39.340 --> 01:55:42.540]  Constitution in order to get Trump.
[01:55:42.540 --> 01:55:44.460]  And I've had people say that to me.
[01:55:44.460 --> 01:55:49.740]  We're prepared to do anything, distort any constitutional provision, ignore any rule of
[01:55:49.740 --> 01:55:52.180]  law if we can get Trump.
[01:55:52.180 --> 01:55:56.940]  And that's why the subtitle for my book, Get Trump, is The Threat to Civil Liberty's Due
[01:55:56.940 --> 01:56:00.020]  Process and Our Constitutional Rule of Law.
[01:56:00.020 --> 01:56:02.060]  It's not only a threat to Trump.
[01:56:02.060 --> 01:56:04.020]  It's not only a threat to people who get indicted.
[01:56:04.020 --> 01:56:10.180]  It's a threat to have the rule of law subordinated to the preference of politics.
[01:56:10.180 --> 01:56:12.740]  And I think we're seeing more and more and more of that.
[01:56:12.740 --> 01:56:17.300]  There's less respect for the Constitution and people on the hard left, particularly
[01:56:17.300 --> 01:56:21.780]  in the woke movement, have said over and over again, we don't care about freedom of speech.
[01:56:21.780 --> 01:56:23.020]  We don't care about due process.
[01:56:23.020 --> 01:56:24.380]  We know the truth.
[01:56:24.380 --> 01:56:27.380]  We know if you're a man who's been accused by a woman, you have to be guilty.
[01:56:27.380 --> 01:56:28.380]  What do you need a trial for?
[01:56:28.380 --> 01:56:30.020]  What do you need due process?
[01:56:30.020 --> 01:56:35.380]  We know if you're somebody who makes statements that are sexist or racist, there's no room
[01:56:35.380 --> 01:56:37.100]  for that under our First Amendment.
[01:56:37.100 --> 01:56:38.980]  We don't need to hear your point of view.
[01:56:38.980 --> 01:56:42.780]  That's what happened in Stanford when a group of people from the National Lawyers Guild
[01:56:42.780 --> 01:56:48.780]  organized an attempt to try to shut down and silence a federal judge whose views they disagreed
[01:56:48.780 --> 01:56:49.780]  with.
[01:56:49.780 --> 01:56:52.820]  The National Lawyers Guild is going to do that all over the country at 100 law schools
[01:56:52.820 --> 01:56:56.140]  where they have organizations.
[01:56:56.140 --> 01:57:00.180]  And so we have to fight back for every one of our amendments.
[01:57:00.180 --> 01:57:05.300]  Look, if I were writing the Bill of Rights, I might not put the Second Amendment in, certainly
[01:57:05.300 --> 01:57:08.740]  not in the ambiguous terms that it's there today, but it's there.
[01:57:08.740 --> 01:57:12.260]  And we have to fight to preserve it, just like we have to fight to preserve the Fifth
[01:57:12.260 --> 01:57:14.900]  Amendment and the First Amendment.
[01:57:14.900 --> 01:57:17.700]  That's the basis of our democracy.
[01:57:17.700 --> 01:57:23.740]  The Bill of Rights is a constraint on majority rule, and we have to keep that viable.
[01:57:23.740 --> 01:57:26.220]  And we're not doing that.
[01:57:26.220 --> 01:57:32.220]  We're allowing partisan political preferences to prevail over the Constitution.
[01:57:32.220 --> 01:57:33.380]  Thanks for being with us, Professor.
[01:57:33.380 --> 01:57:36.660]  I've read many of his books, most of them in my library.
[01:57:36.660 --> 01:57:42.780]  I recommend Get Trump because it's about figuring, as he articulates well, beyond Trump himself.
[01:57:42.780 --> 01:57:44.100]  It's about our rule of law.
[01:57:44.100 --> 01:57:45.100]  It's about America.
[01:57:45.100 --> 01:57:47.340]  So we'll be right back after the break.
[01:57:47.340 --> 01:57:49.540]  Thanks, Professor Dershowitz.
[01:57:49.540 --> 01:57:54.340]  They decided to not, perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mugshot, because
[01:57:54.340 --> 01:57:55.860]  they knew that that would help Trump.
[01:57:55.860 --> 01:57:58.140]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[01:57:58.140 --> 01:57:59.640]  We were waiting for the mugshot.
[01:57:59.640 --> 01:58:02.100]  We learned today they wouldn't have it, so we've made our own.
[01:58:02.100 --> 01:58:07.180]  And it says political prisoner with an image of President Trump.
[01:58:07.180 --> 01:58:09.660]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[01:58:09.660 --> 01:58:12.220]  It'll be shipping out to you in one week.
[01:58:12.220 --> 01:58:18.420]  Political prisoner with Trump on the front there in a mugshot jail background.
[01:58:18.420 --> 01:58:19.420]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[01:58:19.420 --> 01:58:23.580]  It says Infowars.com on the back of the shirt.
[01:58:23.580 --> 01:58:24.860]  We also have Alex Jones for president.
[01:58:24.860 --> 01:58:26.220]  No, I'm not running for president.
[01:58:26.220 --> 01:58:29.420]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt, red, white, and blue.
[01:58:29.420 --> 01:58:31.380]  Alex Jones for president 2024.
[01:58:31.380 --> 01:58:35.840]  It's a fun conversational piece and a limited edition shirt, great way to fund the operation.
[01:58:35.840 --> 01:58:44.040]  So get your Alex Jones for president and Trump mugshot shirts at Infowars.com or by
[01:58:44.040 --> 01:58:49.200]  calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:58:49.200 --> 01:58:53.940]  Every time I talk to you, you're either on the border exposing the cartels and coming
[01:58:53.940 --> 01:58:57.740]  under fire, or you're on the streets of some American city hanging out with drug addicts
[01:58:57.740 --> 01:58:58.740]  and criminals.
[01:58:58.740 --> 01:59:01.800]  And now you've gone to ground zero of a massive chemical spill.
[01:59:01.800 --> 01:59:03.600]  Are you addicted to the danger, Savannah?
[01:59:03.600 --> 01:59:05.600]  Have you ever considered that for a second?
[01:59:05.640 --> 01:59:08.480]  No, I'm addicted to helping my fellow Americans.
[01:59:08.480 --> 01:59:10.200]  I'm addicted to spreading the truth.
[01:59:10.200 --> 01:59:12.480]  And again, you know, I have Infowars to thank for that.
[01:59:12.680 --> 01:59:17.560]  Looking back on the day I was able to ask President Donald Trump two questions, I was
[01:59:17.560 --> 01:59:21.560]  so grateful because, you know, I truly was classically trained under Alex Jones and
[01:59:21.560 --> 01:59:22.760]  under the Infowars team.
[01:59:22.760 --> 01:59:27.760]  I really do credit that as to why I'm able to, you know, get these types of clips.
[01:59:27.760 --> 01:59:32.320]  Because Alex's whole mentality was, you know, go where the story is, go where the
[01:59:32.320 --> 01:59:34.120]  mainstream media refuses to.
[01:59:34.320 --> 01:59:36.560]  So it's not that I'm addicted to the insanity.
[01:59:36.560 --> 01:59:39.840]  I'm just addicted to telling the truth and helping the American people.
[01:59:39.960 --> 01:59:43.960]  And I really do credit Alex for, you know, really instilling that within me early on
[01:59:43.960 --> 01:59:44.600]  in my career.
[01:59:50.400 --> 01:59:56.680]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
