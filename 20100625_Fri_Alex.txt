[00:00.000 --> 00:13.680]  Big Brother, mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex
[00:13.680 --> 00:22.240]  Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:22.240 --> 00:33.280]  Welcome, my friends. Welcome. It is Friday, the 25th day of June, 2010. We're gonna be live here for the next four hours.
[00:33.280 --> 00:39.360]  And then I shall return live this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m. Central Standard Time as well.
[00:41.200 --> 00:50.640]  Well, former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura and host of the hit television transmission
[00:50.640 --> 01:00.240]  conspiracy theory will be joining us coming up in the broadcast later today.
[01:00.960 --> 01:04.240]  So, Governor Jesse Ventura coming up later in the transmission.
[01:05.440 --> 01:11.680]  Then, of course, we have our once-a-week visit from Bob Chapman of the International Forecaster,
[01:11.680 --> 01:17.840]  and he wasn't on with us last week. So, he's got a lot of information to cover. And we're
[01:17.840 --> 01:23.120]  going to cover the news throughout the broadcast as well and take your phone calls.
[01:24.320 --> 01:27.360]  Let me just go through one of the stacks of news. Give you the headlines here.
[01:28.160 --> 01:36.560]  Congress votes to impose embargo on Iran. That's an infowars.com boildown article. Here is Reuters,
[01:36.560 --> 01:48.160]  CongressOK's sanctions on Iran's energy and banks. Here is a story out of the Israeli newspapers,
[01:48.160 --> 01:54.560]  Ynet News. Iran, aid boat will not set sail for Gaza, aid to be sent another way.
[01:57.840 --> 02:03.360]  And the LA Times has the headline, Iran, controversial attempt to break Israeli blockade
[02:03.360 --> 02:12.000]  off Gaza called off. And the LA Times echoes my sentiments. Okay, people, relax. World War 3 is
[02:12.000 --> 02:17.840]  not going to break out this weekend over a high seas confrontation between Iranian aid ships
[02:17.840 --> 02:22.880]  headed to Gaza Strip and Israeli gunboats aiming to stop them. Look, I want the guys and people to
[02:22.880 --> 02:29.520]  get their aid, but I do not want to have an excuse for World War 3 to start between Iran and Israel.
[02:29.520 --> 02:33.680]  And I don't know what the Iranian government was thinking, saying, yeah, we're going to send
[02:33.680 --> 02:43.200]  basically military ships to escort. What was Turkey thinking? And what was Israel thinking,
[02:43.200 --> 02:46.080]  saying they were going to attack them? I mean, I'm glad somebody backed down.
[02:49.760 --> 02:54.480]  I mean, why would Iran want to give Israel an excuse to attack it? Why would Israel want to
[02:54.480 --> 02:59.440]  escalate things and board the ship the way they did? It's just a bunch of people full of bravado
[02:59.440 --> 03:09.440]  pull of macho arrogance. This is how wars get started, my friends. And I want to avert war.
[03:09.440 --> 03:13.680]  It's just like in your daily life. It'd be easy to get to the grocery store. You know,
[03:13.680 --> 03:18.080]  somebody pushes your car out of the way and kind of bows up to you. It'd be easy to punch them
[03:18.080 --> 03:26.080]  right in the face and break their nose and go to jail. But the winner just smiles and says,
[03:26.080 --> 03:30.560]  you're very powerful. Yes, I'm scared of you. Of course, that's a smart mouth thing to say.
[03:30.560 --> 03:34.080]  It's just best to ignore them and act like you didn't notice the slight. Now, if somebody
[03:34.080 --> 03:38.880]  corners you, you don't have a choice. You're going to defend yourself. Take them down as fast
[03:38.880 --> 03:44.720]  as you can. Hurt them bad. Punch them right in the throat. Upper cut them in the nose.
[03:46.400 --> 03:50.720]  And it's the same thing militarily. It's what George Washington stated that
[03:50.720 --> 04:00.160]  walk softly and carry a big stick. As wise as serpents, as peaceful as doves,
[04:00.960 --> 04:03.360]  no foreign entanglements. That's actually what he said.
[04:04.320 --> 04:08.160]  All right, I'm already digressing, but that is good news that Iran has back down and now
[04:08.160 --> 04:12.320]  they'll have a better hand to play against these illegal out of control sanctions,
[04:12.320 --> 04:16.720]  which are acts of war as well. So the good news and the bad news.
[04:16.720 --> 04:20.640]  House and Senate leaders finalized details of sweeping financial overhaul that's passed the
[04:20.640 --> 04:25.040]  House and Senate now in conference. This is really bad. And this is economic sanctions on
[04:25.040 --> 04:30.640]  us, the American people. They're very similar to this next little jewel. Remember a few months
[04:30.640 --> 04:33.920]  ago, they were talking about handing over the islands of Greece, some of the most valuable
[04:33.920 --> 04:39.760]  tourist property? Well, they are. Greece starts putting islands and land up for sale. And the
[04:39.760 --> 04:44.240]  deceptive headline is to save the economy. That's like if you were starving, start eating your own
[04:44.240 --> 04:52.960]  toes, eating your hands. That's coming up. And the G 20 is meeting up in Canada, $1 billion
[04:52.960 --> 04:57.200]  price tag, and they're arresting anybody who tries to even cover it. We'll be back.
[04:59.200 --> 05:04.080]  The fall of America and the Western world was an all new 10 hour documentary and survival
[05:04.080 --> 05:09.280]  guide rolled into one. In this film, you will see the reasons why our government is failing

[08:22.560 --> 08:30.880]  Positive. The ugly. The interesting. How about prosthesis for cats? More more cats and dogs
[08:30.880 --> 08:37.520]  getting little artificial legs and feet. We've got that story up on infowords.com and prismplanet.com.
[08:37.520 --> 08:47.760]  Or how about this one out of Artuz Shiva, Israeli national news. IAF, Israeli Air Force, landed at
[08:47.760 --> 08:56.000]  Saudi base. U.S. troops near Iran border in a gear up for possible war. U.S. aircraft carrier off the
[08:56.000 --> 09:02.960]  coast. Israeli fleet massing nuke submarines saying they may attack. I mean, this is insane.
[09:04.080 --> 09:10.160]  And we've got the U.N. and the United States passing draconian sanctions against Iran, which
[09:10.160 --> 09:16.480]  are an act of war under common law, international law, and common sense. If enemy ships came off
[09:16.480 --> 09:21.680]  our shore and started, you know, trying to force embargoes on goods coming in here and sort of
[09:21.680 --> 09:26.960]  seizing our banking assets worldwide, that'd be an act of war. This is a serious escalation while
[09:26.960 --> 09:33.680]  we're all busy watching sea turtles dying in the crude oil in the Gulf, which is important. But
[09:33.680 --> 09:41.440]  I will assure you the prospect of a Polaris-induced nuclear war is a lot worse. That'll kill a lot
[09:41.440 --> 09:46.560]  more sea turtles. I will assure you. And look at this bizarre ABC News headline. North Korea seeks
[09:46.560 --> 09:52.800]  $75 trillion in compensation. Hey, you're not Goldman Sachs, so you don't get that much taxpayer
[09:52.800 --> 09:58.880]  money. Okay? You were unable to take over the United States. The bankers did it by stealth. Your
[09:58.880 --> 10:06.720]  little 19th century dictator jumpsuit just didn't do it, buddy. Cash trap North Korea has demanded
[10:06.720 --> 10:13.120]  the United States pay almost $75 trillion in compensation for six decades of hostility.
[10:14.240 --> 10:22.000]  That's a good one. That's a really good one. Congressman Rohrbacher says almost all House
[10:22.000 --> 10:28.640]  Republicans think Iraq wore illegal, immoral. That's what is going to be airing tomorrow on Fox
[10:28.640 --> 10:34.880]  Business Channel with the new top-rated, it's only had one transmission, top-rated show
[10:34.880 --> 10:41.840]  that airs on Saturdays and Sundays with Judge Andrew Napolitano showing the future of television
[10:41.840 --> 10:47.280]  if the establishment wishes to survive and have any credibility. They will put patriots on, real
[10:47.280 --> 10:55.280]  patriots, not twisted doppelgangers like Hair Becky Boy. And I mean, yeah, Beck's a light
[10:55.280 --> 11:01.520]  year's better than Chris Matthews. I'm just saying, and then a Judge Andrew Napolitano is
[11:01.520 --> 11:07.520]  light year's better than Beck. I mean, I just can't get much better. But the point is he broke
[11:07.520 --> 11:15.120]  here yesterday that Dana Rohrbacher, one of the leaders of the Republican House on record,
[11:15.120 --> 11:18.960]  said that the majority of Republicans in the House now believe the war was illegal,
[11:18.960 --> 11:24.400]  anti-moral, the video and audio and is up on info wars.com and prisonpana.com.
[11:24.400 --> 11:29.360]  That is a very important story. Of course, remember not this year, but last year, Ron Paul
[11:29.360 --> 11:36.080]  addressed CPAC and he got a standing ovation that went on for about two minutes. And as they panned
[11:36.080 --> 11:41.440]  across the crowd during the different standing ovations, the majority of people were standing
[11:41.440 --> 11:46.160]  up, almost all of them were clapping when Ron Paul said it's not conservative, it's not Republican,
[11:46.160 --> 11:52.480]  it's not libertarian to be pro-war, preemptive war, that bankrupt our country and kill our
[11:52.480 --> 11:58.560]  troops and demonize our name worldwide. And so the vast majority of the real died-in-the-wool
[11:58.560 --> 12:05.520]  Republicans, the leadership of the Republican Party and the general public that are, you know,
[12:05.520 --> 12:12.320]  the hard chargers out there for the Republican Party understand this war was a contrivance
[12:12.320 --> 12:17.040]  and a fraud. And then our borders aren't secured, our country is bankrupt, we are the
[12:17.040 --> 12:22.240]  imperial muscle for offshore banks and they get it. And that's what Dana Rohrbacher said.
[12:22.240 --> 12:29.760]  The first time his show airs on the Fox Business Network that's been around for, what, a couple
[12:29.760 --> 12:36.800]  years, got some highly rated shows, the first time it airs in a dead slot on Saturday morning,
[12:36.800 --> 12:43.600]  I mean, that is a dead time, one of the worst times. That's got similar ratings to 11 or midnight,
[12:44.400 --> 12:51.040]  you know, during the week. It's just a terrible slot. And number one, Jesse Ventura's show,
[12:51.040 --> 12:57.120]  number one out of the gates, never happened on that network, true TV, formally court TV,
[12:57.120 --> 13:03.280]  never happened in court TV history, because people know we're in deep trouble. They know
[13:03.280 --> 13:07.680]  there's a world government, they know there's a new world order, they know foreign banks are robbing
[13:07.680 --> 13:13.520]  us, they know fluorides being put in the water, they know the wars are illegal, they know, okay,
[13:14.160 --> 13:16.880]  they know the government's out of control and criminal and predatory.
[13:16.880 --> 13:22.960]  And that's the message. You put this radio show on, you will get higher ratings for your radio
[13:22.960 --> 13:28.800]  station. And more and more stations are going, wow, I guess Alex Jones really was right all
[13:28.800 --> 13:32.720]  these years, even though it sounded crazy. Look, truth's stranger than fiction. I know it sounds
[13:32.720 --> 13:38.880]  crazy. You're not the only one out there, but I'm not crazy. Everything we've talked about has
[13:38.880 --> 13:42.400]  unfortunately come true. Now, are you ready for the rest of the stuff we've talked about to come
[13:42.400 --> 13:50.320]  true? I mean, is that what you want? Okay, continuing with interesting news here.
[13:54.880 --> 14:03.120]  June deadliest month for troops in Afghan war. The deaths of another four NATO troops in an
[14:03.120 --> 14:07.440]  accident in Afghanistan made June the deadliest single month for US-led forces in nearly nine
[14:07.440 --> 14:18.000]  years of conflict, according to a French news agency, Tali. Continuing, Obama insists on unity
[14:18.000 --> 14:23.920]  after a McChrystal exit. That means the military officers are actually experts in war. They're
[14:23.920 --> 14:29.680]  not allowed to give their own opinions. They've got the parrot, what the limp-wristed drug addict,
[14:29.680 --> 14:39.200]  Barry Sataro has to say. Continuing, Taliban endorses General Petraeus, a new US Afghan
[14:39.200 --> 14:44.480]  war chief, not smarter than McChrystal. This is New York Daily News. We have no idea if this is
[14:44.480 --> 14:51.760]  even true. I mean, every few days, I see articles where they say Ben Lawton said he's going to
[14:51.760 --> 14:57.520]  nuke us. He's going to strike any minute at the bottom of the AP article will say this was posted
[14:57.520 --> 15:03.520]  on a message board and we cannot authenticate and have no idea who posted it. And they just
[15:03.520 --> 15:09.520]  constantly put this stuff out. I mean, who knows if this is real? Who knows? I mean, that's the
[15:09.520 --> 15:16.800]  problem. It seems the evil doers. Oh, you've got to love that journalistic term. It seems the evil
[15:16.800 --> 15:22.720]  doers. You mean the ones that we grow the opium for? You mean the ones that kidnap 14-year-old
[15:22.720 --> 15:27.200]  kids and sell them to US forces who know full well. They're completely innocent. You mean the
[15:27.200 --> 15:31.760]  Taliban and al-Qaeda, 6,000, 8,000 leadership, going out to safety to Pakistan by US forces?
[15:31.760 --> 15:36.320]  It was all staged war. You mean those? You mean this giant intelligence operation that was 9-11?
[15:36.320 --> 15:42.400]  I mean, this is all complete theater. Our troops get compartmentalized and pointed at some
[15:42.400 --> 15:47.520]  province. In every case, it's just a group of Taliban that won't pay their cut of the smack
[15:47.520 --> 15:52.880]  money. That's it. You understand? Period. It's a drug war there. What do you think is tearing Mexico
[15:52.880 --> 15:59.440]  apart? CIA and globalist bank groups are in there taking over the supplies. We told you five years
[15:59.440 --> 16:05.360]  a huge war was about to kick off. There's real cartels, real private drug dealers in Mexico
[16:05.360 --> 16:11.360]  controlling the flow because there's regions all over. Most of the cocaine 30 years ago was
[16:11.360 --> 16:15.920]  grown in Colombia. Now it's grown in other nations and the CIA does not have a monopoly and the big
[16:15.920 --> 16:20.640]  banks don't have a monopoly and they don't like it. I'd like to put all these dirtbags out of
[16:20.640 --> 16:28.560]  business and decriminalize it right now, but that won't happen. It seems the evil doers were just
[16:28.560 --> 16:35.040]  baiting their time to see how the Rolling Stone Flap would play out. Now that President Obama,
[16:35.920 --> 16:42.880]  Barry Sataro, has sacked his top war boss in Afghanistan, Army General Stanley McChrystal,
[16:42.880 --> 16:50.720]  who ran the cover-up murder of Pat Tillman and replaced him with Iraq's Surge Hero.
[16:52.000 --> 16:56.880]  Yeah, the MI6 and other forces quit staging terror attacks to stir up the Shiites and
[16:57.680 --> 17:02.880]  Sunnis between each other. That's why he's a hero. Replaced him with Iraq's Surge Hero General
[17:02.880 --> 17:08.400]  Betrayus. The Taliban has finally weighed in. The verdict, of course they don't give you any
[17:08.400 --> 17:14.400]  source as you read deeper. It should be right at the front. The new boss is the same old boss
[17:14.400 --> 17:18.960]  and Betrayus is a wimp, they claim Thursday. Betrayus is not smarter than McChrystal.
[17:18.960 --> 17:24.800]  Taliban spokesman Khwari Muhammad Ahmad Yusuf said in a statement,
[17:26.160 --> 17:29.920]  and again, no authentication, no nothing. Also, his losing consciousness last week,
[17:29.920 --> 17:34.880]  he had a seizure. An investigative hearing before the members of the U.S. Congress brought his
[17:34.880 --> 17:39.680]  physical competence and his courage into question. That would be a reference to the
[17:39.680 --> 17:44.000]  Decorated General fainting briefly. During a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing,
[17:44.000 --> 17:50.160]  Betrayus recovered quickly blaming dehydration and skipping breakfast, but was told to come back
[17:50.160 --> 17:56.720]  the next day to continue his testimony. His military standing as his four-star rank greatly
[17:56.720 --> 18:02.320]  waned around the world after the fainting episode. Yeah, a bit of a known Julius Caesar
[18:02.320 --> 18:08.000]  was an epileptic. It had been over. Mock the Taliban's Yusuf according to the site intelligence
[18:08.000 --> 18:12.080]  group translation, and they say they got it from a message board. I mean, give me a break.
[18:13.520 --> 18:20.800]  McChrystal, firing by Obama, by the way, has divided victory. The Taliban mouthpiece added.
[18:20.800 --> 18:26.240]  The U.S. position differed significantly. I've said this before. General Betrayus has already
[18:26.240 --> 18:31.680]  established himself as one of the great battle captains. Every time they say his name, they
[18:31.680 --> 18:37.280]  call him great, decorated, comat leader. And so instead of like calling him a strategic general,
[18:37.280 --> 18:43.520]  part of the strategic propaganda, they call him battle captain, which means he was out
[18:43.520 --> 18:51.680]  leading battles. You know, that would be McChrystal, the opium lord. I mean, say what you want,
[18:51.680 --> 18:56.880]  but he was in the Delta Force. Not, not Mr. C. Captain's son. Nothing wrong with that.
[18:56.880 --> 19:01.920]  It's a great profession. Just he's never been on the ground. He's not a special forces guy.
[19:01.920 --> 19:06.240]  That's not saying he's bad. It's just that he's he's probably in there because he probably picks
[19:06.240 --> 19:12.000]  up those, you know, basket special, special basketball games that our sources have talked about
[19:12.640 --> 19:16.480]  be part of the club. I mean, who knows? It's just that that seems to be part of being the club is
[19:16.480 --> 19:21.760]  that you're well. Anyways, as I've said before, General Betrayus has already established himself
[19:21.760 --> 19:30.800]  as one of the great battle captains with a PhD from the New World Order special globalist
[19:30.800 --> 19:37.120]  think tank Woodrow Wilson Center is an American military history. Defense Secretary Robert Gates
[19:37.120 --> 19:44.800]  said at a Pentagon today. Oh, as for divided victory, Gates and McCrystal's downfall doesn't
[19:45.440 --> 19:50.640]  prove disarray within the US military. Yeah, it is. Obama should have just ignored it.
[19:50.640 --> 19:56.560]  But these people have no sense of history. They're idiots. They're all a bunch of arrogant peacocks.
[19:57.200 --> 20:02.720]  We'll be right back. Stay with us. When you hear the words water purification,

[23:14.320 --> 23:20.160]  was pounding. It made me feel breathless. I tried many, many different things to try to get some
[23:20.160 --> 23:25.600]  help for myself. Nothing did anything. Heart and body extract is very powerful, very effective,
[23:25.600 --> 23:31.440]  and works quickly. I saw one of Sharon's ads and ordered heart and body extract. I noticed a

[24:22.080 --> 24:31.520]  Busy producing a new season of conspiracy theory will be joining us later in the broadcast today,
[24:31.520 --> 24:42.640]  so will Bob Chapman. Okay, I've got news so big on the Gulf of Mexico that I am not even going to
[24:42.640 --> 24:49.600]  get to it right now. I'm going to cover it coming up in the next segment because we cover so much
[24:49.600 --> 24:56.080]  incredibly important news. I want to highlight or put an exclamation point at the end of the info
[24:56.080 --> 25:05.040]  we're going to cover coming up in the next segment. This is big news and it does confirm
[25:06.560 --> 25:14.880]  a lot of what I had hoped was fear-mongering out on the internet in the last month.
[25:14.880 --> 25:22.640]  And you know what that fear-mongering is. What I had hoped was fear-mongering.
[25:24.320 --> 25:28.560]  I never really called it fear-mongering. I just said I hope people are overreacting
[25:29.120 --> 25:42.640]  that when the tens of millions of gallons of oil begins being blown in by tropical storms and
[25:42.640 --> 25:46.000]  hurricanes at the end of the summer, we now have a tropical storm forming right now,
[25:47.200 --> 25:52.560]  that it will off-gas so many toxic chemicals and fumes that it will cause an evacuation of the
[25:52.560 --> 25:57.600]  Gulf. We know the military has been moved into the area. We know the EPA has come out in the
[25:57.600 --> 26:03.280]  last two weeks adding some credence to this. Well, I'm going to cover it all coming up in the next
[26:03.280 --> 26:14.560]  segment. It's just really horrible news. And I think it's a mixture of real concern and also
[26:14.560 --> 26:24.000]  panic. But when you get a CFR globalist running around telling the Washington Post that there
[26:24.000 --> 26:28.560]  may be an evacuation of 20, 30, 40 million people and it's now in the Washington Post,
[26:28.560 --> 26:37.360]  look out, ladies and gentlemen, look out. This is the grand aversion while they start World War
[26:37.360 --> 26:42.480]  III and while they take over the banking industry, that is your local bank. That's all happening.
[26:42.480 --> 26:49.600]  Everything's happening right now. It is incredible what is going on. And here's the article, but
[26:49.600 --> 26:54.320]  I'm going to start covering it in the next segment. Oil industry insider and CFR member
[26:54.320 --> 27:00.080]  predicts Gulf evacuation. I'll try to focus on every facet of it coming back in the next segment.
[27:07.120 --> 27:13.120]  But in other news, Congress votes to impose embargo on Iran. Congress on Thursday approved
[27:13.120 --> 27:18.160]  tough new unilateral sanctions aimed at squeezing Iran's energy and banking sectors,
[27:18.720 --> 27:23.040]  which could also hurt companies in other countries doing business with Tehran, Reuters reports.
[27:23.040 --> 27:27.680]  The House representatives passed the bill four hundred and eight to eight and sent it to President
[27:27.680 --> 27:35.520]  Barack Hussein, Barry Cetero Obama for signing into law. The Senate had approved it 99 to zero
[27:35.520 --> 27:41.280]  earlier in the day. Congress has pushed for crippling sanctions against Iran for months
[27:41.280 --> 27:46.720]  at the behest of the Obama. In other words, the behest of the elite Congress held off until
[27:46.720 --> 27:53.520]  the UN Security Council and European Union agreed on the new multilateral sanctions. Congress,
[27:53.520 --> 27:58.720]  however, believes that more punitive measures are still required in order to punish the Islamic
[27:58.720 --> 28:04.480]  state for its nuclear energy program. Iran is permitted under the NPT to develop nuclear energy,
[28:04.480 --> 28:10.560]  but Congress, Obama, Israel and the Europeans insist the program is a cover for a nuclear weapons
[28:10.560 --> 28:17.760]  program. The UN sanctions, though, a good first step are quite tepid and they aren't tepid because
[28:17.760 --> 28:22.240]  there are other members of the Security Council who want to keep going and doing the business with
[28:22.240 --> 28:28.480]  Iran. The United States has to pass unilateral sanctions, declared Democrat Senator Barbara
[28:28.480 --> 28:35.120]  Mikulski. The U.S. has intensified the Gulf and infused the Gulf states with armaments and currently
[28:35.120 --> 28:41.440]  has an armada of warships patrolling Iran's shores. Iran's rulers will sense that the conventional
[28:41.440 --> 28:47.360]  balance of power is tilting dramatically against them, explains the Council on Foreign Relations.
[28:50.800 --> 28:54.960]  Yes, the global empire is amassing armies against Iran. One of the countries they haven't
[28:54.960 --> 29:00.240]  mopped up. They've mopped us up here nicely in the United States, haven't they? And they're teaching
[29:00.240 --> 29:04.960]  us about the balance of power at the CFR with the little oil spill. They're going to teach
[29:04.960 --> 29:10.880]  us to not stand up against their carbon tax, to not stand up against their total takeover society.
[29:11.840 --> 29:17.840]  They're going to show us that their environmental cult of dehumanization and eugenics is the only way.
[29:21.440 --> 29:24.880]  In early June, Bilderberg slew Jim Tucker reported from Spain that the majority of
[29:24.880 --> 29:29.920]  Bilderberg members are now in favor of military strikes on Iran. An attack on Iran will provide
[29:29.920 --> 29:35.280]  a welcome distraction to the globalist. Failings in other areas and will also allow the war
[29:35.280 --> 29:41.120]  prophet here, reported Paul Joseph Watson. We'll be right back. Stay with us. We'll
[29:41.840 --> 29:45.920]  get more into what's happening with Iran and then into what's going on down in the Gulf.
[29:45.920 --> 29:49.680]  This is vitally important. Stay with us. Please spread the word about the transmission.
[29:50.560 --> 29:53.520]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[29:53.520 --> 30:01.440]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. This is Alex Jones with five good
[30:01.440 --> 30:05.200]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator. Number one,
[30:05.200 --> 30:09.440]  new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two,
[30:09.440 --> 30:14.320]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[30:14.320 --> 30:20.000]  It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[30:20.000 --> 30:24.400]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[30:24.400 --> 30:29.120]  And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four,
[30:29.120 --> 30:33.680]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose
[30:33.680 --> 30:38.480]  their power from weather related onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful
[30:38.480 --> 30:42.640]  backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators
[30:42.640 --> 30:46.880]  offered by Solutions from Science, one of my old sponsors. You can get more information

[31:06.160 --> 31:11.440]  made by the Calvin soap company, a family owned and operated American company. My family, staff,
[31:11.440 --> 31:16.240]  friends and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath,
[31:16.240 --> 31:20.400]  air, laundry and dishes. There is nothing like these factory direct, big money saving,

[32:10.320 --> 32:15.280]  is God. The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police
[32:15.280 --> 32:21.360]  states on earth. This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps,
[32:21.360 --> 32:26.800]  now being expanded nationwide. This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program
[32:26.800 --> 32:31.840]  has established an old powerful shadow state. Police state four chronicles the sickening depth
[32:31.840 --> 32:37.920]  to which our republic has fallen. Prepare to enter the secret of world of emergency dictatorship,
[32:37.920 --> 32:43.840]  bodies cameras, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[32:43.840 --> 32:49.360]  It's only the beginning of the new world order's hellish plan. The police state isn't coming.

[33:25.600 --> 33:32.800]  of constant sorrow. I've seen trouble all my days.
[33:32.800 --> 33:40.640]  So the United Nations passes illegal draconian sanctions on Iran. Iran has allowed inspectors
[33:40.640 --> 33:46.240]  into all their facilities. They tried to go that route. They can only refine about half the fuel
[33:46.240 --> 33:53.040]  they need with conventional gasoline, so they're trying to get a nuclear power. I have no doubt
[33:53.040 --> 33:58.400]  that they do have some covert nuclear programs. But the issue is Pakistan has nukes, North Korea,
[33:58.400 --> 34:03.520]  Israel over 400. And why aren't there sanctions on Israel for having nukes outside of the
[34:03.520 --> 34:08.880]  international conventions? This is about world government. This is about the establishment
[34:08.880 --> 34:13.760]  deciding who can have weapons and who can't. And also the war industries always want someone new
[34:13.760 --> 34:18.640]  to be able to attack. Our government, with the British government, has been instrumental at
[34:18.640 --> 34:26.560]  least twice overthrowing the government of Iran in the last 65 years. And it is completely illegal.
[34:28.720 --> 34:33.040]  And it's wrong. Now, does that mean the Iranian government's great or good, or that I support
[34:33.040 --> 34:40.640]  the things they do? No. The issue is, though, this is a illegal operation going on against Iran.
[34:41.200 --> 34:45.760]  And you watch, if this war starts, you're going to pay for it out of your pocketbook.
[34:45.760 --> 34:51.040]  It's going to bankrupt the country further. It's going to at least triple the price of oil for
[34:51.040 --> 34:56.560]  six months or longer and lead to a wider regional war, massively increase the number of troops we
[34:56.560 --> 35:02.240]  get killed. And there will be terror attacks in this country. That'll be Iranian responses that
[35:02.240 --> 35:08.240]  are called terror attacks. And you will be the target. You will lose your freedom. And this
[35:08.240 --> 35:12.960]  giant police state, the establishment is geared up, will be used against you. You can look at
[35:12.960 --> 35:17.920]  the strategic operations of the global crime cabal, and you know what they're doing. They've
[35:17.920 --> 35:22.320]  set up the police state ahead of their banking collapse of the U.S. and Europe, and they've
[35:22.320 --> 35:28.800]  got a war lined up as the political distraction. And we are all the targets of this global crime
[35:28.800 --> 35:35.280]  syndicate. Our nation's being destroyed. Iran's being destroyed. In the end, Israel will be destroyed.
[35:36.160 --> 35:40.000]  There will be no nation states allowed to stand. This will be a global corporate
[35:40.000 --> 35:47.920]  borg hive. Now, the really great news is that's the bad news about the sanctions on Iran.
[35:49.200 --> 35:53.600]  The really good news is that they have not escalated at the UN or Congress yet to start
[35:53.600 --> 35:59.040]  boarding Iranian ships, bringing anything into the country. They're saying no oil, no fuel,
[35:59.040 --> 36:05.040]  no metal, no machinery, no medicine. We are going to board your ships. We are going to put a total
[36:05.040 --> 36:11.200]  blockade in. This is a financial blockade. And any U.S. or multinational corporations that do
[36:11.200 --> 36:16.800]  business in the U.S. that now do any business with anything in Iran, basically, will have their
[36:16.800 --> 36:21.920]  account seized here in the United States. So just brazen criminal activity. And of course,
[36:21.920 --> 36:25.520]  who runs our banks and our government, the big offshore banks that have destroyed the nation?
[36:26.720 --> 36:32.240]  Good news that Iran is not going to give Israel and the United States an excuse to attack them.
[36:32.240 --> 36:38.080]  They are backing off sending armed ships to break the Israeli Gaza blockade.
[36:39.040 --> 36:43.920]  That would certainly escalate things quickly. Aid boat will not set sail for Gaza.
[36:45.040 --> 36:49.440]  Aid to be sent another way. So that's good news that that'll get through. Iran announced that the
[36:49.440 --> 36:54.880]  aid ship to Gaza, which was to leave on Sunday, will not be leaving the Secretary General of an
[36:54.880 --> 37:02.320]  Iranian organization supporting Palestinians. Hussein Shahiq El Islam said during a press
[37:02.320 --> 37:06.640]  conference that the main reason for the cancellation was the Zionist regime's
[37:06.640 --> 37:12.560]  violence and inhuman response to humanitarian aid. He said the aid would be transferred to
[37:13.280 --> 37:20.160]  Gaza in other ways and not in Iran's name. The Israeli News Service, Wynette News reported.
[37:20.160 --> 37:29.760]  This is what the LA Times had to say about it. Iran, controversial attempt to break
[37:29.760 --> 37:35.040]  Israeli blockade of Gaza called off. Okay, people relax. World War Three is not going
[37:35.040 --> 37:39.360]  to break out this weekend over high seas confrontation between Iran aid ships.
[37:40.560 --> 37:45.600]  Headed to the Gaza Strip and Israeli gunboats aimed at stopping them. International observers,
[37:45.600 --> 37:50.480]  including certain overworked Middle East correspondents, read a sigh of relief Friday
[37:50.480 --> 37:55.360]  after Iran called off its plan to try to break through Israeli's blockade of the Palestinian
[37:55.360 --> 38:01.200]  enclave. Israeli commandos killed nine Turkish activists aboard a Gaza bound aid ship late last
[38:01.200 --> 38:07.200]  month in an incident that practically reconfigured the diplomatic topography of the Middle East.
[38:07.200 --> 38:16.400]  Yeah, it blew up in Israel's face big time and Iran would have been really putting
[38:16.400 --> 38:21.680]  themselves in deep water if they would have engaged in some type of military skirmish with
[38:21.680 --> 38:28.640]  Israel. This is really bad news that this was even being considered by Iran, by Tehran.
[38:28.640 --> 38:35.920]  But the good news is they're backing off for now. House Senate leaders finalized details
[38:35.920 --> 38:42.960]  of sweeping financial overhaul. This is from the Washington Post. And then when you read deeper
[38:42.960 --> 38:49.360]  in the article paragraph six, you find out what's in the legislation. And we've gone over the
[38:49.360 --> 38:53.120]  legislation months ago with the Judge Napolitano, with Ron Paul, many others.
[38:55.920 --> 39:01.440]  And it is a nightmare. You see national news going Ron Paul and his son Ron Paul don't want to
[39:01.440 --> 39:07.920]  bring the banks to justice. Yeah. Yeah, they don't want to overhaul the banks. They don't want to
[39:07.920 --> 39:15.600]  bring them to justice like Obama's doing. Remember back last year the Financial Stimulus Act and
[39:15.600 --> 39:20.000]  Obama's up on the news shaking his fingers saying we're going to get these big central banks,
[39:20.000 --> 39:27.440]  these big mega banks, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and others, Bank of America. We're going to get
[39:27.440 --> 39:37.360]  them. Now we're going to stand up against them. And then it came out in the legislation that it
[39:37.360 --> 39:44.560]  gave them total anonymity, more power, trillions more and made all the money they'd stolen retroactively
[39:44.560 --> 39:50.880]  secret and in the future retroactively secret and allowed the secret transfer of money in the
[39:50.880 --> 39:56.880]  future to the mega banks that were original recipients of the quote tarp and all the other
[39:56.880 --> 40:02.000]  money. And then people saw Senator Dodd's bill and they said, well, this actually gives them more
[40:02.000 --> 40:06.080]  money and makes it secret and allows them in perpetuity to keep stealing and gives them all
[40:06.080 --> 40:10.320]  this power. And Obama said, well, that's Senator Dodd. How dare you? And Dodd released emails
[40:10.320 --> 40:16.160]  in the White House telling him to do it. I mean, that's what they do, ladies and gentlemen. They
[40:16.160 --> 40:20.880]  tell you one thing and they do another. They say zig, it's zag. They say up, it's down. They say
[40:20.880 --> 40:27.520]  black, it's white. They say two plus two equals eight. Doesn't equal four. And they have experts
[40:27.520 --> 40:32.800]  get up on the news and say you're a racist. If you don't believe two plus two equals a hundred,
[40:32.800 --> 40:37.200]  you are a racist. And you say, well, what does that have to do with race? Oh, covering up for
[40:37.200 --> 40:41.600]  yourself, making excuses racist. Well, I don't want the banks robbing me. I don't want government
[40:41.600 --> 40:46.640]  run healthcare written by the insurance companies. Shut up, racist. And then we're so conditioned
[40:46.640 --> 40:51.440]  to be politically correct. We start defending ourselves instead of saying, look at you engaging
[40:51.440 --> 41:02.000]  and race pimping and mind control. A new consumer. Now, now, now, now listen to the Washington Post
[41:02.000 --> 41:13.920]  here. A new consumer protection bureau. Oh, oh, that's like saying Al Capone is going to be someone
[41:13.920 --> 41:21.920]  fighting alcohol and supporting the supporting arresting organized crime.
[41:24.240 --> 41:32.160]  A new consumer protection bureau housed in the federal reserve, the private holding company
[41:32.800 --> 41:41.120]  of the private banks, the kingpins. A new consumer protection bureau housed in the
[41:41.120 --> 41:46.960]  federal reserve, the authors of our misery, the authors of the global banking takeover,
[41:46.960 --> 41:53.920]  the financial dictatorship, the authors of it. A new consumer protection bureau housed in the
[41:53.920 --> 42:00.960]  federal reserve would have independent funding. Oh, an independent leader that means from government
[42:00.960 --> 42:09.440]  and near total anonymity and autonomy and your total autonomy to write and enforce rules. So
[42:09.440 --> 42:13.920]  the federal reserve is given even more power, but not just to issue all the money they want to
[42:13.920 --> 42:19.360]  themselves in derivatives and to tell Congress to go fly a kite when they ask where the money went,
[42:19.360 --> 42:24.560]  but now they're in control of all financial institutions or any institution that affects
[42:24.560 --> 42:32.320]  the economy from a hot dog stand to your salon to your tiny factory. They run it all when this
[42:32.320 --> 42:40.080]  goes through. This is total banking dictatorship, not with a bang, but with a whimper. Don't worry,
[42:40.080 --> 42:44.320]  though, folks, tyranny is coming out in the open. We will repeal all of this. We will repeal the
[42:44.320 --> 42:48.320]  government takeover of health care. We will repeal this. The federal reserve and their own
[42:48.320 --> 42:52.160]  internal memorandum that have been leaked are scared. They know that they've been identified as the
[42:52.160 --> 42:57.520]  real and illegitimate government. They have been identified as the puppet masters, the puppeteers,
[42:57.520 --> 43:03.920]  pulling the strings of the marionette. It's over. No World War Three will save you. No
[43:03.920 --> 43:15.280]  martial law will save you. You've now been identified. Can you say bye-bye? Can you say time is on my
[43:15.280 --> 43:23.360]  side? Oh, yes it is, as the Rolling Stones say. In fact, go find that on YouTube, Rolling Stones.
[43:23.360 --> 43:28.400]  I want to play a clip of that. Time is on my side. I want to play that in a moment. A new Consumer
[43:28.400 --> 43:33.280]  Protection Bureau housed in the Federal Reserve would have independent funding, an independent
[43:34.880 --> 43:42.160]  leader, and near total autonomy, near total, no, it is total, to write and enforce rules. The
[43:42.160 --> 43:47.440]  government would have broad new powers. See, that's the little lie right there when they tell you
[43:47.440 --> 43:51.760]  that this is the government, the Federal Reserve. The government would have broad new powers to
[43:51.760 --> 43:57.040]  seize and wind down large failing financial firms. That's a lie. It's mainly targeted to local
[43:57.040 --> 44:02.880]  regional banks as the Texas Banking Association said two months ago, to wind down large failing
[44:02.880 --> 44:10.880]  financial firms and to oversee the 600 trillion derivatives market. Oh, what an amazing part
[44:10.880 --> 44:17.600]  truth. It's now 600 trillion we have. I thought it was just 800 billion you needed. Oh, it's 600
[44:17.600 --> 44:28.240]  trillion. Try 1.5 quadrillion or basically triple that. Economists we talked to a decade ago said
[44:28.240 --> 44:35.120]  it was 600 trillion, but the government would have new broad powers to seize and wind down
[44:35.120 --> 44:40.960]  large failing financial firms and oversee the 600 trillion derivatives market. In addition,
[44:40.960 --> 44:46.400]  a council of regulators headed by the Treasury Secretary Goldman Sachs would monitor the financial
[44:46.400 --> 44:50.960]  landscape for potential seismic rifts and take over any institutions they wish. I mean, this is
[44:50.960 --> 44:55.920]  just complete dictatorship by these people, just what they wanted in Greece and God and just what
[44:55.920 --> 45:04.000]  they wanted in Iceland and didn't get. Now, what's happening in Greece? And then I'm getting into
[45:04.000 --> 45:10.720]  the incredible Gulf news. Greece starts putting island land up for sale to save economy, London
[45:10.720 --> 45:16.800]  Guardian. That'd be like man on desert island cuts off his own hands and eats them to survive. No,
[45:16.800 --> 45:25.120]  that's not surviving. That's absorbing yourself. That's dying. This is all made up. Goldman Sachs
[45:25.120 --> 45:29.840]  went in was their financial minister a decade ago when they made the change. They rule the country
[45:29.840 --> 45:36.400]  today. Goldman Sachs openly runs the country and now the main industry Greece had their one crop
[45:36.400 --> 45:42.160]  economy was their islands. The country is an island and they're now turning it over to the
[45:42.160 --> 45:50.080]  globalist. What are they going to have olives? That's their second biggest crop. They are a one
[45:50.080 --> 45:58.000]  crop economy. Desperate attempt to repay debts also driven by inability to find funds to develop
[45:58.000 --> 46:06.320]  infrastructure on islands. Oh, and so it's, oh, it's a good thing. You see, there's little that
[46:06.320 --> 46:12.000]  these shouts seriously rich as much as the little island in the sun to call your own. For Sir Richard
[46:12.000 --> 46:21.520]  Branson, it is a Nicar in the Caribbean. The billionaire Barclay brothers prefer the Channel
[46:21.520 --> 46:27.920]  Islands. Why Aristotle and Asses married Jackie Kennedy on Scorpios, his Greek hideaway. Now Greece
[46:27.920 --> 46:32.480]  is making it easier for the rich and famous to fulfill their dreams by preparing to sell or
[46:32.480 --> 46:38.800]  offering long term leases on some of its 6000 sun kissed islands in the desperate attempt to repay
[46:38.800 --> 46:45.120]  its mountainous debt. You got to love that. All of these big brokerage firm heads, some of them
[46:45.120 --> 46:49.200]  making five, six, seven, eight billion a year. I was reading an Esquire article about that just
[46:49.200 --> 46:55.440]  this last weekend with this one guy who makes billions a year. And they're the ones that came
[46:55.440 --> 47:00.480]  in, took over the country's covertly. They're the ones that put their people in control of the
[47:00.480 --> 47:04.880]  treasuries. They're the ones that sold the derivatives and made money on that. Now the
[47:04.880 --> 47:10.080]  countries are imploding because they were sold the debt bombs. They then go and sell their islands,
[47:10.080 --> 47:14.240]  not to the IMF, not to the World Bank. They bypass that directly and go to the banker
[47:14.240 --> 47:20.240]  kingpins and they come and buy the islands, giving Greece back a pittance of the money stolen.
[47:22.240 --> 47:28.320]  Let me see. That'd be like if a bank robber robbed a bank and then the bank was bankrupt,
[47:28.320 --> 47:31.680]  a little local bank, and then they knew the bank robber robbed it. He went and bought a mansion
[47:31.680 --> 47:36.720]  down the street. And then the old bank president with the farmers who've lost everything, who
[47:36.720 --> 47:40.560]  invested in the bank, went with their hats and hands to the bank robbers house and said,
[47:40.560 --> 47:46.080]  will you give us a loan? We'll give you our wives, part of our property. We'll be your slaves,
[47:46.080 --> 47:49.120]  but will you just give us part of the money back to put in the bank so we can have the bank?
[47:50.000 --> 48:00.400]  I might just do that for you, my dear. This is rich, isn't it? This is a bondage in your face.
[48:01.040 --> 48:04.320]  And the news, of course, being willing accomplices goes along with it. And of course,
[48:04.320 --> 48:10.960]  when the president shows up for a big event or a summit, the news reports the security might
[48:10.960 --> 48:16.800]  cost three, four, five, six, seven million in some cases when they have a little conference.
[48:18.320 --> 48:24.240]  But when the SPP meets secretly in Canada, it cost more than $200 million at one meeting in
[48:24.240 --> 48:30.160]  Banff. It cost more than $300 million they reported two years ago at their Montabello meeting outside
[48:30.160 --> 48:39.120]  of Ottawa, the capital in Canada. And when they meet in England, it cost over 200 million pounds.
[48:39.120 --> 48:44.880]  Well, now they're meeting up in Canada, the G8 and G20, the private banking leaders. The
[48:44.880 --> 48:51.280]  real government is arriving, our owners. And for the few thousand protesters that brave
[48:51.280 --> 48:55.520]  being arrested for no reason, the press is being arrested, everyone just if you're there with a
[48:55.520 --> 49:01.360]  camera just on the street corner, the police come and arrest you. We've got it all over infowars.com
[49:01.360 --> 49:08.400]  and prismbunna.com, the video of it. People being arrested just for just being there. You just know.
[49:10.000 --> 49:15.040]  It cost, first it was going to be 900 million, then a billion. Now the news is reporting over
[49:15.040 --> 49:26.000]  $1.1 billion for a three-day event. That is as big as the budget of the city they're meeting in each
[49:26.000 --> 49:33.280]  year. That's as big as the Austin budget every year. One plus billion dollars for three days.
[49:33.280 --> 49:36.400]  And there's news all over Canada saying, well, this is the price we pay to be leaders and have
[49:36.400 --> 49:42.240]  these great people here. And the debt will go to them. It'll go to the bankers. See, their religion
[49:42.240 --> 49:48.320]  is spending your money because then when you go bankrupt, they control you. One billion G20
[49:48.320 --> 49:53.760]  security bill cost of Canada's role in the world. That's CBC News and of course now they're reporting
[49:53.760 --> 49:59.360]  it's $1.2 billion. It says the G20 summit now sits at approximately $1.2 billion. So see,
[49:59.360 --> 50:07.280]  the headline is just very deceptive. So it's $1.2 billion and then of course probably $1.5
[50:07.280 --> 50:14.960]  by the time they're done. And of course this is a payoff to the police state and the private firms,
[50:14.960 --> 50:20.720]  the private security and their private police that were seen in Pennsylvania at the Pittsburgh
[50:20.720 --> 50:24.240]  event last year where one of my reporters got arrested and where Luke Radowski got tortured.
[50:25.200 --> 50:35.840]  And at these events, they don't allow anyone on the major areas of the city streets,
[50:35.840 --> 50:40.240]  they attack old women coming out of stores with police dogs. That's on video. And
[50:42.240 --> 50:47.680]  they just basically suspend all liberty and freedom because your owners, your gods, your rulers,
[50:47.680 --> 50:52.640]  your kings and they had private security and military uniforms snatching and grabbing people
[50:52.640 --> 50:58.320]  off the streets of Pittsburgh in front of everyone. I mean, the secret police running around arresting
[50:58.320 --> 51:07.440]  everyone. Global meltdowns, massive unemployment, endless wars, a new currency crisis, financially
[51:07.440 --> 51:12.880]  and morally bankrupt, a great and terrible storm is approaching. So what's the best way to get ready

[54:24.080 --> 54:29.840]  in history. They're fraudsters, not even banksters and they're going to be caught.
[54:31.920 --> 54:34.160]  They have been identified, they will be brought to justice.
[54:35.440 --> 54:40.720]  All right, I'm going to cover this more when Bob Chapman's on with us coming up in the third hour
[54:40.720 --> 54:44.720]  and in the fourth hour. We're going to open the phones up on this subject and I'm going to spend
[54:44.720 --> 54:53.760]  an entire hour on this in the fourth hour today but more and more it looks like that bare minimum
[54:53.760 --> 55:01.360]  the council on foreign relations, the Pentagon, the shadow government is considering using the
[55:01.360 --> 55:08.640]  Gulf disaster as a pretext to stage some type of New Orleans style martial law in a three to
[55:08.640 --> 55:16.240]  four state area from south Texas to Florida and the oil is also going to go up the east coast
[55:16.240 --> 55:23.840]  during the tropical storm and hurricane season. So this is just extremely, extremely serious and
[55:23.840 --> 55:32.160]  we have an article up on infowars.com by Curt Nimmo. Oil industry insider and CFR member predicts
[55:32.160 --> 55:39.520]  Gulf evacuation buried in an article on the Gulf of Mexico scenarios and predictions on the Washington
[55:39.520 --> 55:47.840]  Post quotes Matthew Simons, founder and chairman of emeritus of Simons and company international
[55:47.840 --> 55:54.160]  whose CFR in response to a tropical storm brewing in the Caribbean. Simon says we're going to have
[55:54.160 --> 55:59.840]  to evacuate the Gulf States. You imagine evacuating 20 million people. This story is 80 times worse
[55:59.840 --> 56:06.880]  than I thought. Now is he doing that as CFR fear mongering or is he picking up on some of the other
[56:06.880 --> 56:10.080]  what could be potential fear mongering out there on the internet in the last month
[56:10.720 --> 56:14.720]  saying that you know there were already evacuations going on in the Gulf a month ago which was not
[56:14.720 --> 56:20.560]  true but troops are being obviously put in place and blocking the relief effort under orders from
[56:21.200 --> 56:27.360]  president Barry Cetero. The national hurricane center said today that a stormy region in the
[56:27.360 --> 56:32.720]  Caribbean will get organized and strengthened into a tropical storm and as a 40% chance of becoming
[56:32.720 --> 56:39.040]  a tropical cyclone in other words a hurricane in the next two days an estimate that was a zero a few
[56:39.040 --> 56:44.000]  days ago upper level winds were expected to become more conductive for development of this system
[56:44.640 --> 56:51.200]  as it moves westward or west north westward around 10 miles per hour of the next couple of days
[56:51.200 --> 56:58.080]  said the Baltimore Suns meteorologist. There is a medium chance of this system becoming a tropical
[56:58.080 --> 57:03.200]  cyclone in the next 48 hours. AccuWeather also basically says the same thing and if it gets blown
[57:03.200 --> 57:08.720]  in if those what is it 50 million gallons a few weeks ago I mean who knows what it really is
[57:08.720 --> 57:16.720]  they've been lying about how bad it is 50 60 70 million gallons I don't know no one knows but
[57:16.720 --> 57:21.120]  you can see it from satellite covering more than half the Gulf right now if that gets blown in see
[57:21.120 --> 57:25.680]  right now it's in the currents out to sea and starting to go around Florida and out into the
[57:25.680 --> 57:30.320]  Atlantic but if those hurricanes come in the hydrologist and meteorologists know it's going
[57:30.320 --> 57:36.560]  to be blown into the shore that means Texas Louisiana Mississippi Florida it's going to be
[57:36.560 --> 57:43.680]  extremely serious and this oil is off-gassing a lot of fumes it's confirmed deaths of cleanup

[01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:39.040]  new show on true tv picked up for a second season he's been out shooting in the last month back from
[01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:46.240]  mexico a lot has happened behind the scenes of course i'm not allowed to talk about it and the
[01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:50.320]  governor of the head of the show he can talk about as much of it as he wants but it's been very
[01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:57.520]  interesting i'll tell you this i can't get emails to because i'm consulting someone from home from my
[01:00:57.520 --> 01:01:02.240]  employees emails to tyrell and other people working on the show so there's a lot of a lot of
[01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:07.760]  chicanery going on with the governor out there on the road because he's getting close to some really
[01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:13.760]  uh you know dangerous issues he'll talk about the oil spill we'll get into the economy uh the wars
[01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:19.040]  mccrystal all of it today of course his new book has been on the new york times bestseller list for
[01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:24.000]  the last two months it's available in bookstores everywhere jesse ventura with dick russell
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:29.440]  american conspiracies it's also available at info wars dot com and he's not on the talk circuit
[01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:33.040]  right now you know a few times a year he comes out does interviews he's giving us this interview
[01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:38.880]  he gave larry king one a few weeks ago and so i feel very honored to have the governor join us
[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:43.760]  governor great to have you great to be here alex no i only did the larry interview because they
[01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:49.840]  requested and that oliver stone was going to be on and i i thoroughly enjoy oliver's movie
[01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:57.040]  making and his talent and uh and if we could go on that for a moment he he sent me a copy of his
[01:01:57.040 --> 01:02:03.760]  film uh i think it's called south of the border the documentary and i watched it and as i said
[01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:12.080]  i'm larry king i urge everyone to watch this film because it's on hugo chavez and it's on
[01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:19.920]  south america and it also covers how things that we're hearing here through our media are totally
[01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:26.880]  wrong from what the reality is down there well i know the media lied and said that chavez
[01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:32.560]  had said that a u.s weapon caused the Haitian earthquake and then it did get retracted later
[01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:37.360]  but a little bitty paragraph in the washington post the new york times he never said that well
[01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:43.840]  the thing is about it it's even bigger than that alex it's a case of this it's now clear to me
[01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:50.560]  and i don't get me wrong i'm not anti-business i'm not anti anything really i'm a great believer
[01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:58.880]  in freedom but it seems that any country that nationalizes their oil and nationalizes their
[01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:05.520]  natural resources and doesn't let our corporations go in there and for lack of better terms rape
[01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:12.800]  and pillage them well we then call that person a communist a dictator and we start working to oust
[01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:20.400]  them i mean we attempted to cool against chavez back in o3 but the people the guy's been voted
[01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:26.800]  into office so many times you can't imagine all the other south american leaders walked the guy
[01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:35.200]  he comes from a very modest background of being one of the people he truly is and let people be
[01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:42.960]  their own judge but when oliver and i were on the show here comes congressman uh what's his name
[01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:51.040]  from florida on facebook connie back and he's advocating that this film should be banned and
[01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:58.000]  i ask him have you seen it he goes no that's the big picture alex is that we're supposed to be a
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:04.000]  free country you don't have to like you go chavez but you should at least have the ability to learn
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:10.320]  about the guy from alternative sources and not just what our government tells us about him well
[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:16.080]  that's the renaissance way and i did watch the larry king episode and he did say basically ban it
[01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:22.080]  and what an amazing anti-american statement even if i disagree with something i think that you know
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:30.000]  it should be available ban things here you know banning things that's ridiculous we learn because
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:35.440]  we learn all about things and then make proper judgments and we can all make them but you
[01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:41.600]  certainly can't make them if you're not getting necessarily the whole truth or can't seek alternative
[01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:49.440]  methods of learning about stuff if we rely solely on our government alex and the mainstream sound
[01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:57.040]  mic media we will be the most ignorant nation in the world well in many respects we are stay there
[01:04:57.040 --> 01:05:03.600]  governor jesse ventura will be right back hello this is alex jones with some important questions

[01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:08.080]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:13.120]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:18.720]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:23.840]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:29.120]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous
[01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:33.600]  weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power
[01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:38.960]  from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance
[01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:42.800]  and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions

[01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:07.200]  ease the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the gcn radio network
[01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:16.640]  all right for the balance of the hour governor jesse ventura joins us on this exclusive
[01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:23.360]  interview and we're going to get into the open announcements of the federalization of the internet
[01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:30.400]  the march towards war with iran we're going to cover Lieberman and mccain's bill to secretly
[01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:36.240]  arrest us citizens outside of judicial law and only an act of congress can order your release
[01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:39.840]  or even find out where you are we're going to discuss all of us today and he's also had some
[01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:44.400]  really spooky things happen uh i wish he could tell you more he'll tell you as much as he can
[01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:50.800]  with his contract with uh true tv he can't you know what i had of the season tell you what's
[01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:56.320]  happening with the production but it is it is wild what is going on so that's coming up later in
[01:08:56.320 --> 01:09:00.400]  the hour but for folks that just joined us governor you were getting into a few weeks ago when you
[01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:04.960]  did larry king i want to the only interviews you've done since you got back from mexico and they
[01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:12.400]  had this congressman on calling for the censorship of this oliver stone movie about uh latin american
[01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:17.200]  leaders yugo chavez and their systems of government and whether you agree with the film or hate the
[01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:22.720]  film you shouldn't call for censoring it but you've seen the film break down why you think it's
[01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:28.800]  viewing that everybody should see well everybody should see it because oliver shows clearly how
[01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:35.920]  how what the truth is and then shows how our mainstream media completely lie to us they tell
[01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:42.880]  us a completely different story about the truth of what what's going on and the other thing that's
[01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:49.920]  huge is that uh the destiny they don't want us all they want to do is control their own destiny
[01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:56.560]  they don't want us meddling and attempting to you know do things down there that we've been
[01:09:56.560 --> 01:10:02.080]  doing for decades and decades like one of the leaders says i'll be happy to have a united
[01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:11.120]  states military base in my country if they'll give me one by miami now isn't that fair how does it
[01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:16.640]  that we can put military bases in all these foreign countries yet they can't put any here
[01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:23.920]  well on top of that we've got me it's it's just things like that and the other thing is alexis
[01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:30.160]  they're now banning together a six or eight of the countries down there and they're not going to do
[01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:35.440]  business necessarily on foreign policy with the u.s unless cuba's included
[01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:39.600]  and i think that's a wonderful idea
[01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:48.560]  well the quickest way to bring more freedom to cuba would be to end the embargo absolutely the
[01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:54.880]  embargo is a miserable failure it doesn't hurt castrol or his brother a bit the only thing
[01:10:54.880 --> 01:11:01.440]  it harms is the cuban people and the only thing let's talk about that you have met fidel castro
[01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:06.240]  and then you actually got followed by the cia uh tell folks what happened when you were in cuba
[01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:11.920]  when you were governor and the aftermath of that well it was just uh you know i'm probably the only
[01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:17.360]  elected official who actually sat down with fidel castro and i had an hour with him and it was when
[01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:23.760]  he was in better health you know this was back in 2002 you know since then i've heard you know it's
[01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:29.120]  only what i've heard that he's had health problems but at the time i met him he was sharp as a whip
[01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:34.800]  i mean you couldn't get a thing by him in fact when i was sitting with him i only had an hour
[01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:40.160]  i wore a watch then i happened to just glance down at my watch to see that i had 20 minutes left
[01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:46.800]  castro was so perceptive immediately and i just glanced and when i looked up he said i'm sorry am
[01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:53.360]  i keeping you from something and i of course was honest i said no sir i said but i know i only have
[01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:58.240]  an hour with you and i glanced at my watch and i see that i only have 20 minutes left and i'd
[01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:03.360]  like to ask you some personal questions if i could and he said to me ask me anything you want
[01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:09.200]  and so then i went in and asked him about the murder of john f kennedy because it was something
[01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:15.680]  that i had studied for the better part of my adult life and here i had a chance to talk to someone
[01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:21.680]  who was right in the middle of it and who in some scenarios he was attempted to be blamed for it
[01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:28.240]  and so i wanted to get his perception of what happened back then and you know if you're open
[01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:34.640]  minded like me i realized that to every story there's going to be three or four sides to that
[01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:41.040]  story and to fully understand the story you need to talk to three or four sides and that's the
[01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:46.720]  problem again getting back to our country today alex we're not getting three or four sides we're
[01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:53.040]  getting one well as you've said we have the two parties that are really almost identical twins
[01:12:53.840 --> 01:13:00.320]  and they give us basically different flavors of poison kool-aid but at the end of the day
[01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:05.280]  there's really no difference no there's none whatsoever it's it's all the stuff that's coming
[01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:11.600]  out you know and then i'll let we'll transition now you know let's go to the show we've been
[01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:20.080]  out shooting some episodes and uh last week i spent the whole two to three days basically under
[01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:26.160]  surveillance by homeland security and tailed by the coast guard and all other sorts of stuff
[01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:35.680]  and we weren't doing anything illegal at all we were merely going somewhere to film something well
[01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:40.400]  they've got to know that governor jessie ventura isn't going to stage a terror attack well i would
[01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:46.400]  think they wouldn't i think that that my record speaks for itself that i love my country but that
[01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:52.720]  i'm a firm believer alex that before you go out and chastise someone like hugo chavez that you
[01:13:52.720 --> 01:14:00.080]  should make sure that your own backyard is clean and tidy and up to snuff can you even give people
[01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:05.520]  about the united states of america today we have a lot of problems in our own backyard that we ought
[01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:12.080]  to take care of instead of meddling in everyone else's business can you give people a hint as to
[01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:18.400]  the type of thing you were trying to uh get a look at well we just wanted to vote we just wanted to
[01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:26.960]  film a certain location in the country and we were in the water we were in international water
[01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:30.800]  and we just wanted to photograph what was there
[01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:37.840]  and we were tailed by the coast guard and put under surveillance by homeland security
[01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:49.120]  well and before we could even go out uh we had we had a whole harbor of boats that wouldn't
[01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:53.840]  take us because of fear of homeland security
[01:14:56.480 --> 01:15:02.880]  and now alex isn't homeland security there supposed to be protecting us yes they are
[01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:09.920]  then why are they striking fear into the united states citizens red white and blue people through
[01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:18.160]  and through like me and you and like a lot of these fishermen why are they spreading that
[01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:23.360]  type of fear to them well it's come out in homeland security documents that they were the black
[01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:28.400]  uniforms to intimidate about all that but you know what i'm starting to call them the gestapo
[01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:36.560]  and that's some pretty strong words alex it is elaborate on that governor well to me
[01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:42.240]  they seem to be some sort of security force that's getting control of everything in our
[01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:49.680]  country now and they supersede anything else because they're federal much the same as the
[01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:55.520]  federalese in mexico well they've also been caught breaking the law spying without warrants
[01:15:55.520 --> 01:16:02.080]  on american citizens that even in non-terror related uh cases and uh they don't want you
[01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:06.960]  showing the public what you were showing because there's 36 of those they're building around the
[01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:13.520]  country and it's not defensive but i better be quiet at that no no and this is no and you're
[01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:19.440]  what you're talking about is not what i'm talking about oh i knew you guys were working on that
[01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:23.760]  other thing oh we're working on all sorts of different stuff right now we got eight to ten
[01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:29.360]  episodes to do and i'm already working on three to four right now as we speak some days i'm doing
[01:16:29.360 --> 01:16:37.440]  this episode other days not yes but uh no it's okay then then i also found it very interesting
[01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:45.920]  i went to a place where alex for the mere uh infraction of trespassing it's become a capital
[01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:57.200]  offense really they can shoot and kill you for trespassing and that's a place out in the desert
[01:16:57.200 --> 01:17:06.240]  well and it and just there's no fences or anything and if you make the mistake and cross this line
[01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:14.960]  out there uh they authorize they can kill you without a trial or anything governor your phone
[01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:20.640]  was just breaking up i hate to add to the conspiracy atmosphere but i repeat what you just said
[01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:25.920]  because your phone was breaking up i'm sorry well they there's no the place that we were at has no
[01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:32.320]  fences or anything it's it's it's parked but there's nothing to stop anyone from going through
[01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:39.760]  and lethal force is authorized now imagine if you're out in the desert you're not paying attention
[01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:45.840]  and you ride the dirt bike or something and you pass by this particular boundary that's not very
[01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:55.040]  well marked and they they have the right to shoot you and kill you because they say they have the
[01:17:55.040 --> 01:18:02.400]  right well it says that it's authorized and that they and and the federal laws listed underneath it
[01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:09.280]  so apparently somewhere along the line our congress gave them the right to kill you for
[01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:14.400]  trespassing well i agree with you governor just like congress in the past said blacks weren't human
[01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:22.080]  you know i mean somewhere along the line that must have taken place because there's a there's a uh
[01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:29.840]  uh you know it's it's written on law about the on the when you read it well you've got
[01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:35.840]  homeland security all over you you know as part of my role you're consulting some on the show
[01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:41.200]  just with facts and information and research i can't get an email to anybody all of a sudden
[01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:46.000]  you know let me work on that you know i'll find out about that probably over the weekend and early
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:52.000]  next week but uh you know i don't know if it if it's really that mysterious alex or not i'm not
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:19:00.080]  sure yet but i just apologize because i mean i was a governor i'm a mayor i served my country for six
[01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:06.960]  years in the navy i'm as patriotic as anybody could imagine and it just seems like if you speak
[01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:13.600]  out now or question anything in this country you will be treated like there's some adversary to the
[01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:18.480]  country well that's because the country's been seized by offshore banks that have been looting
[01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:23.040]  trillions of dollars from us and homeland security in the military now work for them
[01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:31.440]  well i don't know yeah yeah i hate to say it but i'm not sure you know it's it's very well
[01:19:31.440 --> 01:19:39.920]  how about the news in afghanistan now i know why we're there oh yes the uh lithium the lithium

[01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:36.640]  i've got a bunch of twitter questions i'm going to get to as well for the governor but continuing
[01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:42.240]  a lot of other things have happened with the tv show but we'll just leave it at that because
[01:24:42.240 --> 01:24:47.840]  uh you you're still working on a lot of these stories and don't want to alert the establishment
[01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:52.960]  to what you're doing but before we get into afghanistan going back to you saying it appears
[01:24:52.960 --> 01:25:00.000]  homeland securities gestapo i mean you are intensifying uh your uh view of these people why
[01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:08.000]  well because i find them uh in my dealings with them to be very uncooperative they seem to use a
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:16.720]  lot of of scare tactics again you know excuse me we're united states citizens our police and our
[01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:24.480]  whatever should not be out there and using those types of behavior the bottom line is this alex
[01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:32.960]  a few months ago i signed a check for well into six figures to the united states government right
[01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:39.360]  yes you know what i'm talking about i paid my freaking taxes well i'm sure it's the same in
[01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:46.400]  austin texas as it is done in south minneapolis and that's this when you're paying the money
[01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:53.440]  doesn't that make you the boss that's our republic that's our form of government no i mean in life
[01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:59.520]  yes you're paying the money that makes you the boss the customer's always right well i'm paying the
[01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:06.080]  money and these people treat me like i'm some sort of a criminal i had one of them quote say to me
[01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:13.920]  you're not the governor anymore with his back turned to me wow now i found that completely
[01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:22.720]  disrespectful and i found it outrageous that these people that i pay their salaries with my taxes
[01:26:22.720 --> 01:26:30.080]  and they can they can speak and treat to me in that manner oh well let's come out that homeland
[01:26:30.080 --> 01:26:36.240]  security is surveilling members of congress same thing in england they're using mi6 and mi5
[01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:40.880]  to spy on members of parliament when a member of parliament released the info they swat teamed
[01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:46.720]  his house in a quote search for intimidation so the bureaucracy has just run wild well you know
[01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:52.640]  i i can't answer any of that alex because i'm ignorant to it all i can you know i live in mexico
[01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:57.120]  half the year but all i can say is that's the results that i've gotten since i've been back
[01:26:57.120 --> 01:27:02.880]  in the u.s and it makes me want to go back to mexico because even the federales aren't that bad
[01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:09.360]  well this is this is amazing i i sure wish you could tell people more but they'll see it
[01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:14.640]  on the television transmission when is that coming up in the fall again it should be uh just don't
[01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:18.560]  market him don't put it in stone but look forward around october
[01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:25.680]  you know just around i think around october hopefully and i guess it's hoping for anyway
[01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:31.680]  there's nothing you know i i know no definitive time or anything at this point time but i would
[01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:35.760]  say mid through the fall that uh will be far enough along to where we could start another
[01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:40.480]  airing another eight to ten episodes and it's too early to let people in on what some of the
[01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:46.640]  episodes are about i'll never do that sure if i do that they they they they don't know i understand
[01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:52.560]  learning when everyone else does same here i i i know the shows and i've got my mouth completely
[01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:56.960]  zipped but this season is going to be even more hardcore than the last i mean i think that's fair
[01:27:56.960 --> 01:28:02.800]  to say well it might be that certainly it's starting off with a lot more resistance than the first
[01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:13.760]  season did and usually when you're getting more resistance that means it could be more exciting
[01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:19.840]  it's been more exciting for me so far but you're a fighter i mean that makes you only want to push
[01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:26.240]  harder well you know it did i i believe in my country and i believe that uh the citizens of
[01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:32.480]  the country are supposed to be number one and it seems that we're not anymore that uh and and so
[01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:37.920]  in light of that fact i always like to try to make it that the citizens are number one because
[01:28:37.920 --> 01:28:41.760]  that's what i believe our forefathers had in mind when they created the country
[01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:47.520]  we're gonna go to break in a moment and i do want to come back and get into afghanistan and
[01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:54.720]  then the bp oil spill oh god like i said alex i now know why we're in afghanistan it's called
[01:28:54.720 --> 01:29:03.040]  lithium that's what every computer every cell phone everything that our modern technology must have
[01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:10.720]  it's as valuable as oil and and they've determined afghanistan is the b spot in the world that has
[01:29:10.720 --> 01:29:17.600]  it that makes things way more clear to me as to why the war on terror is a sidelight that's the
[01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:24.160]  cannon fodder that's the red herring let's elaborate on that with governor jesse ventura

[01:33:10.800 --> 01:33:15.920]  we're going to get into the war mccrystal the oil spill a bunch of other issues but i
[01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:20.800]  i wish you knew what i knew about the new season of conspiracy theory with jessie
[01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:25.520]  ventura coming up in the fall now you were worried governor last time that it wouldn't air
[01:33:25.520 --> 01:33:30.800]  and you had a bet with the crew and with myself and others that it wasn't going to air and then
[01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:38.000]  it did air and got top ratings now you say you're getting a lot more resistance do you think there's
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:43.280]  a chance it won't air this time well if it don't it won't be from it won't be from the people at
[01:33:43.280 --> 01:33:51.040]  true tv mark jurist because uh he's assured me in fact he told me point blank eye to eye that it
[01:33:51.040 --> 01:33:59.040]  never ever entered a conversation that these shows wouldn't air and so i'm fully now expecting
[01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:04.880]  there i mean they they let the first season go you know i mean how would they now come out for
[01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:11.440]  the second round and say no these can't so i you know i i'm moving forward with the full
[01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:17.120]  anticipation that they'll all be on well it's also a number one show so if something happens
[01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:21.760]  there you're going to be able to find another venue if you choose to continue your important work
[01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:27.920]  well i don't know because let's all remember the a lot of the tv stations fall under the same
[01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:34.160]  corporate umbrella you know that they're that that situation does move out there you know
[01:34:34.880 --> 01:34:40.240]  and uh uh just like what i i've learned through the grapevine uh you know things pass through
[01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:46.480]  the grapevine and you learn a lot more five seven years later i now learned that msnb see that
[01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:52.560]  off me and said that i was impossible to work with and all sorts of nonsense like that because of
[01:34:52.560 --> 01:34:58.640]  what i did get my tv show because i opposed the invasion of the war in iraq well i wanted to bring
[01:34:58.640 --> 01:35:03.840]  that up uh national polls now show that obama is dipping below 40 points he's losing his democrat
[01:35:03.840 --> 01:35:08.720]  support uh he's now expanded more wars than george bush has statistically according to the
[01:35:08.720 --> 01:35:15.200]  washington post as well uh i mean this war situation just goes on and on and on what's your view on
[01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:21.920]  that well for me it's as simple as this alex it's time to end this nonsense we're the only country
[01:35:21.920 --> 01:35:28.400]  in the world that is occupying other countries and invading other countries we're the only one
[01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:35.840]  nobody else out there's occupying anybody and my view is let's bring all let's let's not only bring
[01:35:35.840 --> 01:35:43.760]  the troops home let's bring our harmony 78 foreign bases or whatever ridiculous amount it is all
[01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:52.800]  throughout the world let's come home that they should be over with that's my opinion people may
[01:35:52.800 --> 01:35:59.520]  not agree with me but my opinion is enough of this well we wouldn't be bankrupt if we weren't trying
[01:35:59.520 --> 01:36:04.480]  to be an empire and the point i always try to point out is the american people pay for this empire
[01:36:04.480 --> 01:36:10.400]  but we're not getting any of the goods uh that are being uh extracted and that would be immoral
[01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:14.480]  even if we were but this idea that we're going to get the money from the trillion dollars of
[01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:20.640]  lithium or we're going to get the oil no we fit the bill for these multinational corporations that
[01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:28.320]  use our nation as their muscle exactly exactly and it's not new go back and read about uh
[01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:34.720]  two-time congressional medal of honor winner general smidley butler he wrote a great book
[01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:40.880]  way back in the in the early part of the last century talking about in the end of his fabulous
[01:36:40.880 --> 01:36:46.400]  military career he felt that they were nothing but the strong arm for corporate america down in
[01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:52.160]  central and south america that when they wouldn't cooperate they sent smidley and the marine quarry
[01:36:52.160 --> 01:37:00.080]  and that's what we've been i got in trouble about a month and a half ago or whatever two months
[01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:05.760]  maybe longer now i don't know time flies when you're having fun but uh i went on fox news and
[01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:11.520]  stated unequivocally i said why is this country think that uh we were so shocked that we would get
[01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:18.160]  attacked by terrorists if indeed we did to the level we have and i said when we've been practicing
[01:37:18.160 --> 01:37:24.640]  terrorism for 50 years we just call it foreign policy well now they have over a thousand drones
[01:37:24.640 --> 01:37:32.240]  operated by the pentagon and the cia separately where people 10 000 miles away our 25 year olds
[01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:39.600]  are piloting drones and now the headline and the ap was cia to now kill with drones unnamed
[01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:44.400]  terrorists and if they just see someone with a gun in pakistan or afghanistan they drop a
[01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:50.400]  hellfire missile on them and they admit if we kill 150 people at a wedding to kill one bad guy
[01:37:50.400 --> 01:37:55.280]  that's okay since when is dropping a bomb on a wedding and killing a bunch of men women and
[01:37:55.280 --> 01:38:00.560]  children because they think one bad guy may be there since when is that not terror well and
[01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:09.840]  not only that but look what we've done to cuba for 50 years cuba has done nothing to us you know
[01:38:09.840 --> 01:38:15.200]  yet we've blown up ships in their harbor we've destroyed attempted to destroy their painfield
[01:38:15.200 --> 01:38:20.320]  attempted to destroy their economy we put an embargo on them that has caused them nothing
[01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:25.280]  but suffering down there we've attempted to kill their president and of course you're familiar
[01:38:25.280 --> 01:38:31.680]  with the character or lando bosh aren't you yes yeah well here's a guy that blew up a cuban plane
[01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:39.360]  with 73 civilians on it and he was admittedly cia and he gets pardoned by george bursinger
[01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:45.040]  he was admittedly cia and got pardoned by george bursinger blew up the um olympic team the cuban
[01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:49.920]  olympic team but on top of that we have the abc news headline u.s. government plan to terrorize
[01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:56.800]  cities as pretext for war with cuba they had a 9 11 style attack planned to be blamed on cuba but
[01:38:56.800 --> 01:39:04.320]  kennedy said no exactly and that was way back in 61 called operation northwards and the point of
[01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:10.480]  the matter is and why do you think che glibara grew to hate us so much here was a guy who was a
[01:39:10.480 --> 01:39:16.720]  medical doctor someone that took the oath of healing and he ended up a revolutionary that
[01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:22.240]  murdered people and all of that but the big question to ask is why did he feel that way well
[01:39:22.240 --> 01:39:28.560]  he felt that way when he took the motorcycle ride in south america and he saw indigenous people
[01:39:28.560 --> 01:39:34.560]  that had lived on the land for two to three hundred years being forced off the land by united fruit
[01:39:34.560 --> 01:39:41.840]  and u.s. corporations that's how why we're hated so much throughout the world is because we inflict
[01:39:41.840 --> 01:39:48.080]  ourselves upon and another thing to where we inflict is in the so-called war on drugs that's
[01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:53.920]  just an excuse to give us a military presence in all these other countries well i mean the pentagon
[01:39:53.920 --> 01:39:59.040]  knows our own government knows that if they decriminalize drugs almost all the crime will disappear
[01:39:59.040 --> 01:40:04.720]  like a vapor and that mexico is collapsing because of the drug war down there the cartels
[01:40:04.720 --> 01:40:08.800]  battling each other and you've got the cartels that are allied with the government who pay the
[01:40:08.800 --> 01:40:14.000]  government off waging war on the other cartels that aren't laundering their money through us banks
[01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:17.840]  that's what the whole war is really about and now governor i know you've been out of the country
[01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:22.880]  and on the tv show fox news interviewed a marine corps colonel who admitted yes we grow the opium
[01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:28.160]  over there we have to or the taliban will get the market you know that's the excuse in the 1980s
[01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:33.280]  a ship in the crack cocaine in was well if we don't ship it in somebody else will i mean this is
[01:40:33.280 --> 01:40:38.640]  incredible so they're now admitting even in Reuters and ap that our government is producing
[01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:44.560]  the opium in afghanistan well it doesn't surprise me because by everything that i've read when the
[01:40:44.560 --> 01:40:49.760]  taliban took over they put them out of business but they they took these guys and started tossed
[01:40:49.760 --> 01:40:55.520]  them in jail and stuff and literally shut down the opium business and what's interesting is
[01:40:56.080 --> 01:41:02.160]  it coincides perfect with the collapse of the banks and now now the opium business is back
[01:41:02.160 --> 01:41:07.280]  up full throttle again and the banks are back doing good business aren't they 500 plus billion a year
[01:41:07.280 --> 01:41:12.400]  out of afghanistan alone laundered leverage that's uh you can leverage it 10 times through the fractional
[01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:17.840]  reserve banking good point governor ventura governor jesse ventura joins us his new book is
[01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:22.880]  several months in the new york times bestseller list as high as number four jesse ventura american
[01:41:22.880 --> 01:41:28.320]  conspiracies it's also available at info wars dot com i think the good news here though is your
[01:41:28.320 --> 01:41:33.520]  show number one for a new show on tru tv your book a bestseller judge andrew depolitano is the best
[01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:40.560]  guy on fox anti you know corruption his new show premiered on fox business highest ratings ever
[01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:46.880]  on that network anybody who tells it like it is is successful and i think that's a mirror
[01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:51.040]  of the state of the country there is an awakening happening are you seeing that when you travel
[01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:56.240]  around america i'm starting to i'm starting to see the kindling starting again you know i've
[01:41:56.240 --> 01:42:03.600]  gotten some people have gotten in contact with me uh you know that that have said that the the tea
[01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:09.840]  party has been taken over by you know sarah paleon and them but there still is a core group of tea
[01:42:09.840 --> 01:42:16.480]  party people out there the ron paul people and uh they're out there and they're starting to grumble
[01:42:16.480 --> 01:42:22.560]  a little bit and we're starting to see more but i have to tell you something uh alex i no longer
[01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:29.520]  support the third party movement why is that well i know you'll find that shocking but here's why
[01:42:30.400 --> 01:42:36.880]  i believe so strongly that for any that the two parties make the rules and for any third party
[01:42:36.880 --> 01:42:42.640]  to play in the game they're gonna have to corrupt themselves just like the democrats and republicans
[01:42:42.640 --> 01:42:49.280]  do well we already have a two-headed monster why would we want a three-headed one instead this
[01:42:49.280 --> 01:42:57.760]  is my position now my position now is i want political parties banned get rid of them well
[01:42:57.760 --> 01:43:02.160]  the founders had a big debate about that because look at the parliamentary system in england you
[01:43:02.160 --> 01:43:07.360]  can have four or five parties the same special entrances buy them all off well the thing is this
[01:43:07.360 --> 01:43:12.480]  the two we've already got two corrupt parties why do we need a third and for me it's mostly
[01:43:12.480 --> 01:43:19.280]  in the voting booth alex you can still have political parties they can still endorse but no
[01:43:19.280 --> 01:43:25.280]  one can officially be part of them we need to turn them into being nothing more than lobbyists too
[01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:29.440]  well that's an interesting idea because and that way wait let me finish and that way when
[01:43:29.440 --> 01:43:36.000]  you're going to vote all you see is the name john smith it doesn't say john smith republican john
[01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:41.760]  smith democrat see people are given the scapegoat to be enabled to vote for the party rather than
[01:43:41.760 --> 01:43:48.480]  the person this forces you to go back voting for the person rather than the party wow that's a really
[01:43:48.480 --> 01:43:54.000]  good idea because then you also don't have the mafia of the parties who when new congressmen
[01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:58.160]  and women come in they tell them you're not going to have any authority or power unless you play
[01:43:58.160 --> 01:44:04.560]  ball and then the vote is negated exactly turn the parties into nothing more than lobbyists
[01:44:05.200 --> 01:44:11.040]  you have to run on your name no party can be listed on a ballot it also then makes an
[01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:18.320]  incumbent for you the voter to educate yourself which is also good well the problem with third
[01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:23.200]  parties is they can never build up the muscle of the other parties that are over 200 years old
[01:44:23.200 --> 01:44:29.440]  and that's because they have to corrupt themselves alex when the two parties make the rules to the
[01:44:29.440 --> 01:44:35.280]  game and control it as completely as they do the only way a third party can survive is by
[01:44:35.280 --> 01:44:41.200]  falling to the same corruption and then you've got a three-headed monster instead of a two-headed one
[01:44:41.200 --> 01:44:45.840]  well you've always said vote out incumbents and don't vote for democrats or republicans but the
[01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:52.080]  good news is every incumbent is being voted out in the off-year elections every pro-establishment
[01:44:52.080 --> 01:44:58.080]  candidate be they republican or democrat whether it's a hell of a start i mean well this isn't
[01:44:58.080 --> 01:45:03.120]  just one party's in favor and other parties out of favor this is a real political realignment
[01:45:03.120 --> 01:45:08.560]  and the media ran a hoax a year and a half ago they ignored republicans being booed at town halls
[01:45:08.560 --> 01:45:14.080]  they only focused on democrats being booed and they lied and said the tea parties were republican
[01:45:14.080 --> 01:45:19.840]  that then became a self-fulfilling prophecy where democrats then wouldn't be involved with them
[01:45:19.840 --> 01:45:25.760]  and so that was msnbc and fox literally engaged in a stage tag team but going back to msnbc
[01:45:26.320 --> 01:45:32.160]  i had them uh demonize me a few weeks ago they came down here chris mathews uh you know interviewed
[01:45:32.160 --> 01:45:39.520]  me for about two hours and they used about three minutes of me took it all out of context edited it
[01:45:39.520 --> 01:45:47.440]  and basically said that i'm calling for violence uh and which i've never done in any way and that's
[01:45:47.440 --> 01:45:53.280]  the new talking point and i've just found that msnbc is the most deceptive and nasty group
[01:45:54.080 --> 01:46:01.040]  i've ever seen uh and what's your take on that because you experience well i have a bit of a
[01:46:01.040 --> 01:46:08.560]  biased opinion i guess because uh like i said they hired me a three-year contract and then when they
[01:46:08.560 --> 01:46:13.760]  learned i was opposed to the invade because remember when they hired me they were not left us the
[01:46:13.760 --> 01:46:20.000]  keep oberman was not a liberal then they were fox light they were attempting to compete with fox
[01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:26.400]  being and we laughing we called them fox light and when they found out that i and they had just
[01:46:26.400 --> 01:46:33.040]  hired phil donahue and phil was their number one rated show when they found out that phil and i both
[01:46:33.040 --> 01:46:39.360]  have opposed the invasion of the war in iraq before it happened uh we were phil was removed the number
[01:46:39.360 --> 01:46:44.720]  one show and i wasn't allowed on and that shows what political whores they are keith oberman
[01:46:44.720 --> 01:46:52.160]  will read whatever he's told off that teleprompter they all will hannity will glenn you know i just
[01:46:52.160 --> 01:47:00.240]  glanced at a book i'm glenn back you know what his claim the fame is completely he's a top 40 disc
[01:47:00.240 --> 01:47:08.080]  jockey now why should keith carry any credibility whatsoever he's never been an elected official
[01:47:08.080 --> 01:47:13.920]  he's never worked in government he never served his country in the military he hasn't done anything
[01:47:13.920 --> 01:47:20.560]  but be a top 40 disc jockey who found his nicks in what he's doing and he's becoming exceptionally
[01:47:20.560 --> 01:47:27.680]  wealthy over it well my issue with beck is he's flip flop so much and he just came out of nowhere
[01:47:27.680 --> 01:47:34.160]  in 2002 and for those of us that have been doing this for decades it's it's frustrating to see him
[01:47:34.160 --> 01:47:42.400]  turn the entire awakening movement into some type of corporate republican foxoid animal so it can be
[01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:47.680]  discredited and so the movement against tyranny can be basically co-opted that's my problem with
[01:47:47.680 --> 01:47:53.120]  glenn beck i mean i sent him where the fema camps are the civilian and mate labor camp program
[01:47:53.120 --> 01:47:58.080]  the houston chronicle the wall street journal about the fema camps i mean it's actually hidden
[01:47:58.080 --> 01:48:05.200]  in plain view uh and on his show he just came out and debunked straw man uh and and he's done
[01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:10.400]  that so i mean he said ron paul supporters may be violent terrorist uh and then now he says he
[01:48:10.400 --> 01:48:16.000]  loves ron paul so he's always followed that government talking point and and and so i know
[01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:22.160]  he's not for real i don't have to even agree with somebody 90 to like him i just agree with some of
[01:48:22.160 --> 01:48:26.720]  your views but i know you're for real i know you can be counted on i know you really stand for
[01:48:26.720 --> 01:48:34.080]  something and are a good guy you know at your bottom but with with beck he is a uh you know
[01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:39.360]  they're all that way but you know every one of them they you know i learned that when i was doing
[01:48:39.360 --> 01:48:46.320]  my show one of the big fights i had with msnbc on a daily basis they would send you what topics you
[01:48:46.320 --> 01:48:54.800]  could talk about and for me at that time it was it was kopey bryant and lacey peterson
[01:48:56.000 --> 01:49:02.880]  now those are good human interest stories if you're international inquirer stuff i'm not into that
[01:49:02.880 --> 01:49:08.240]  i'm into i'm in the news that affects us on a general basis everyone in the country in some way
[01:49:08.240 --> 01:49:15.280]  shape or form and those types of stories don't and so i would fight with them every day from on
[01:49:15.280 --> 01:49:21.840]  high saying i'm not doing lacey peterson i'm not doing kopey bryant well i don't have i don't care
[01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:27.920]  to have an opinion on either yes the peterson thing was a tragic murder but it was but there
[01:49:27.920 --> 01:49:33.360]  were 10 000 other murders that took place well what it is governor is a feedback loop as you know
[01:49:33.360 --> 01:49:39.600]  they set the agenda with fluff and crap because if they ever gave us real issues and and then it
[01:49:39.600 --> 01:49:44.960]  would become a self-fulfilling process where the people would want to know about real issues
[01:49:44.960 --> 01:49:50.240]  instead of being distracted with uh you know what happened with a murder in the caribbean
[01:49:50.240 --> 01:49:55.920]  or what's going on with the congressman and his pages people would be talking about real issues
[01:49:55.920 --> 01:50:01.120]  but now that the alternative media has gotten so powerful hey you want to hear what the what
[01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:08.320]  one of the big stories up here in minnesota is lately what there's a a state legislator who
[01:50:08.320 --> 01:50:16.320]  came out a number of years ago that he was gay right which is fine and dandy i have no problem
[01:50:16.320 --> 01:50:23.200]  electing gay people to office if they can do the job who cares well the big thing up here now is
[01:50:23.200 --> 01:50:32.320]  he was seen going out to dinner with supposedly some porno star well how does that affect any way
[01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:37.760]  he governs it is nothing to do it's his private life well they feed us with his propaganda and and
[01:50:37.760 --> 01:50:41.840]  so the question i have for you and we're skipping the break uh here this is a network break so stay
[01:50:41.840 --> 01:50:48.960]  with us everyone uh here's politico Lieberman bill would strip citizenship secretly arrest you put
[01:50:48.960 --> 01:50:55.040]  you in a dungeon it's moving to the senate right now new bill gives obama kill switch to shut down
[01:50:55.040 --> 01:51:01.200]  the internet and the fcc announces new regulations they're proposing a box in your house uh they're
[01:51:01.200 --> 01:51:05.520]  already putting this in australia software that blocks what you're allowed to look at
[01:51:06.160 --> 01:51:13.360]  and surveils uh what you're doing and so what's happening is uh they know the alternative media
[01:51:13.360 --> 01:51:20.000]  is kicking behind in of the corporate media that wants to force uh you know all of this fluff on us
[01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:25.760]  and so they are now moving as a perfect storm corporate media and government to try to block
[01:51:25.760 --> 01:51:30.960]  the alternative media governor you know if people aren't outraged over that if that doesn't
[01:51:30.960 --> 01:51:37.120]  cause a revolution what should i mean that's absurd and i can't believe joe Lieberman's
[01:51:37.120 --> 01:51:45.040]  Jewish isn't he yes of all people why would he support something like that
[01:51:48.480 --> 01:51:52.480]  it's insane it sounds like something run out of Stalinist Russia or Nazi Germany it sounds
[01:51:52.480 --> 01:52:00.400]  right out of Nazi Germany to me exactly what and and that's what the just baffles me him of
[01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:08.720]  that people would would be the signer and the carrier of this bill that would give government
[01:52:08.720 --> 01:52:15.280]  control over literally and they could define who is considered good who's considered bad the the
[01:52:15.280 --> 01:52:21.600]  bill actually says for any intelligence person for any intelligence reason uh it's the violent
[01:52:21.600 --> 01:52:27.280]  belligerence act uh that a designate of the attorney general or the president or the pentagon
[01:52:27.280 --> 01:52:32.000]  uh that that they can literally snatch and grab you and used enhanced interrogation
[01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:37.200]  and that you can never be released never given a trial and only an act of congress uh can even
[01:52:37.200 --> 01:52:43.040]  find out where you are and this is going to be inside the united states of america this is racing
[01:52:43.040 --> 01:52:50.160]  through the senate right now boy uh john mccain's the cosponsor and they have a bill that mirrors
[01:52:50.160 --> 01:52:54.640]  the bureaucracy of the fcc and federal trade commission they have a bill that puts in the
[01:52:54.640 --> 01:52:59.040]  black boxes and has cyber security takeover the internet they're already building the nsa hubs
[01:52:59.040 --> 01:53:04.080]  they've got one down at san antonio when reporters try to go take photos of the huge facility police
[01:53:04.080 --> 01:53:08.400]  come out and arrest them that's in the news i mean governor this you're right when you say
[01:53:08.400 --> 01:53:17.920]  gestapo this is a total takeover right now of our society well if you know what can you say if we
[01:53:17.920 --> 01:53:23.360]  allow them to do that then i guess we deserve what we allow them to do well god bless you you're
[01:53:23.360 --> 01:53:26.720]  fighting hard i mean you could have just retired and ridden off to the sunset i know that's what
[01:53:26.720 --> 01:53:30.960]  you want to do and but i mean here you are fighting the tyranny and now you're being
[01:53:30.960 --> 01:53:36.160]  surveilled and followed around by homeland security well you know what can you say it's
[01:53:36.160 --> 01:53:42.880]  nice to be popular well we've only got about five six minutes left governor i just can't
[01:53:42.880 --> 01:53:46.800]  thank you enough for giving us this exclusive interview outside of uh you know any other
[01:53:46.800 --> 01:53:51.280]  interviews you're doing this week or even i'm doing not alex in fact i'm playing a lot of golf
[01:53:51.280 --> 01:53:57.040]  right now on every day that i'm not working because i'm treating this whole summer as a full work
[01:53:57.040 --> 01:54:03.760]  summer so on days that i'm not working i'm doing what i i'm i'm relaxing to the max no different
[01:54:03.760 --> 01:54:09.680]  than when somebody works monday through friday well on the weekend they relax and so when i'm home
[01:54:09.680 --> 01:54:15.200]  now i relax because i'm now out on the road again and uh you know i'm not getting any younger i
[01:54:15.200 --> 01:54:22.240]  do it all this stuff absolutely appreciate the exclusive interview and your and your time uh
[01:54:22.240 --> 01:54:28.160]  getting into some other subjects here the gulf oil spill i mean obama and his controllers really
[01:54:28.160 --> 01:54:36.000]  have blocked the states and others from trading so to me to me it's unconscionable how could an
[01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:44.800]  oil company not have a plan in place for a leak that's the bottom line to me alex they drill all
[01:54:44.800 --> 01:54:51.680]  these wells under the surface of the ocean all over the world and they don't have a clue how to cap
[01:54:51.680 --> 01:54:59.920]  one off if something goes wrong well looks like obama may get his carbon tax because of this
[01:54:59.920 --> 01:55:04.720]  though i mean what is putting a bunch of taxes on us have to do with fixing the oil well it doesn't
[01:55:04.720 --> 01:55:13.600]  but the point is how on earth can they i i'm just i'm speechless how could they not have some type
[01:55:13.600 --> 01:55:21.120]  of emergency standard operating procedure that is not in place if one of these things goes haywire
[01:55:22.560 --> 01:55:28.160]  i agree with you it's that's where the bottom line ends for me and yet now they want to build
[01:55:28.160 --> 01:55:33.760]  all of them and they still don't know how to cap them off shouldn't they learn how to cap them off
[01:55:33.760 --> 01:55:39.120]  if something goes wrong before we continue to drill more of them well they knew how and they
[01:55:39.120 --> 01:55:44.720]  ordered halliburton and anadarka who were running the rig uh to not follow those procedures and
[01:55:44.720 --> 01:55:50.640]  what did uh bp did that's actually i've called for criminal investigations wow that's outrageous
[01:55:50.640 --> 01:55:58.640]  you know uh like i said before any new drill is any new drilling done they better have a
[01:55:58.640 --> 01:56:05.600]  rock solid procedure that works to stop it if something goes wrong well yes sir governor
[01:56:05.600 --> 01:56:09.360]  they did and i've got the coast guard hearings they had three weeks ago it's gotten very little
[01:56:09.360 --> 01:56:13.840]  news Atlantic monthly and others have covered it and in those minutes they talked to the ship
[01:56:13.840 --> 01:56:18.720]  engineers the the drilling rig engineers and they said that the the well was leaking two
[01:56:18.720 --> 01:56:23.920]  months before not two weeks before and that the whole thing happened because bp told them to do
[01:56:23.920 --> 01:56:30.480]  cost-saving measures that that in their words i told them and this is witnesses that i told them
[01:56:30.480 --> 01:56:36.160]  it would effing explode and catch on fire well then there's people that ought to go to jail then
[01:56:36.960 --> 01:56:45.040]  it's as cut dry and simple as that the people who did that should go to jail i agree with you i got
[01:56:45.040 --> 01:56:50.240]  to say i agree with you the first cop and that's all i got to say about that we've only got about
[01:56:50.240 --> 01:56:54.560]  two three minutes left with you governor uh in closing the iran situation they're putting more
[01:56:54.560 --> 01:56:59.680]  sanctions on them they're talking about boarding iranian ships engage in regular commerce israel's
[01:56:59.680 --> 01:57:06.400]  got nuke subs off their coast uh iran is backed off trying to run through the israeli block blockade
[01:57:06.400 --> 01:57:11.360]  what's your view on what even the la times is saying today could shape up to be the start of
[01:57:11.360 --> 01:57:17.440]  world war three well i don't know if it'll shape up the world war three you're not but i i think
[01:57:17.440 --> 01:57:22.720]  it's been on the radar screen for a long long time let me finish your show by telling your
[01:57:22.720 --> 01:57:30.160]  listeners this i have become a huge fan of colonel elf ledger proudy i've i'm reading i've read all
[01:57:30.160 --> 01:57:36.800]  his books he's written i now have eight hours of cd that i've become in contact with and for those
[01:57:36.800 --> 01:57:44.240]  that don't know who colonel proudy was he died in 2001 but he always said nothing just happens
[01:57:44.240 --> 01:57:52.080]  everything everything is planned and the point being is ledger proudy was the mr x character in
[01:57:52.080 --> 01:57:58.400]  oliver stone's great movie jfk the character played by donald sutherland that's who he was in real
[01:57:58.400 --> 01:58:05.920]  life and when you read proudy's books you will get a total new history lesson from world war two
[01:58:05.920 --> 01:58:12.480]  to today and you'll understand clearly that each and every one of these wars is pre-planned that
[01:58:12.480 --> 01:58:18.800]  they're always planned for third world countries and that there's never anything that the military
[01:58:18.800 --> 01:58:25.440]  can achieve in which to declare victory and that's exactly what we've had in every war since world war
[01:58:25.440 --> 01:58:31.120]  two and sky horse publishing does not surprise me alex that we're going into iran i think it's
[01:58:31.120 --> 01:58:36.560]  been planned for for decades and sky horse publishing is republish the secret team available

[01:59:00.400 --> 01:59:05.600]  constitution which protects minority rights not democracy not mob rule two wolves and a sheep

[02:00:12.640 --> 02:00:28.560]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[02:00:28.560 --> 02:00:42.800]  we are back live ladies and gentlemen now in to hour number three a power packed exclusive
[02:00:42.800 --> 02:00:46.640]  interview with governor jesse ventura he wasn't going to do any interviews for the next really
[02:00:46.640 --> 02:00:50.800]  three to four months but he did the show with oliver stone and larry king live because they
[02:00:50.800 --> 02:00:57.200]  asked him and he did this show because we were talking a few weeks ago about it and he he'd offered
[02:00:57.200 --> 02:01:02.080]  to come down to austin when he was in texas working on a jfk piece but he ended up doing
[02:01:02.080 --> 02:01:06.960]  interviews in dallas instead of here and so uh he's running out of time to come sit in on the
[02:01:06.960 --> 02:01:12.560]  show his idea he still may do it when he's done shooting the tv show uh in the fall but that'd
[02:01:12.560 --> 02:01:17.200]  be neat have jesse ventura he said he'd come to a whole week down here i could probably hold him to
[02:01:17.200 --> 02:01:23.120]  it but i probably won't he's a busy guy but that was a an exclusive interview you won't be hearing
[02:01:23.120 --> 02:01:29.200]  any more interviews with ventura for the next few months unless it's um something like larry king
[02:01:29.200 --> 02:01:35.680]  live he's challenged glenn beck uh you know to a debate to have him on uh but beck is afraid to
[02:01:35.680 --> 02:01:40.880]  do it i don't know why i mean beck would get even higher ratings off that i mean beck's a smart guy
[02:01:40.880 --> 02:01:45.440]  he's a talented guy i don't know why he should be scared of uh of a jesse ventura jesse he's a
[02:01:45.440 --> 02:01:51.920]  formidable intellect as well but i mean he's also a nice guy especially when he's in studio with you
[02:01:51.920 --> 02:01:56.640]  i mean he he's friendly in a debate and i don't know what glenn beck is scared of is my point
[02:01:56.640 --> 02:02:03.520]  uh and he calls him stupid jesse ventura is a big stupid idiot and he talks like this no he doesn't
[02:02:03.520 --> 02:02:08.000]  jesse's a really nice smart guy and i count him as a friend and i'm honored that he counts me as a
[02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:16.480]  friend and uh you know he uh gets a lot of advice from me i get advice from him and his wife's a
[02:02:16.480 --> 02:02:22.480]  sweetheart uh his kids are great people tyrell's a great guy and they're just really good people i
[02:02:22.480 --> 02:02:28.800]  know jesse ventura is real and i don't agree with him on every issue uh but i love the fact that he's
[02:02:28.800 --> 02:02:33.280]  real and he is for the little guy and same with ron paul i don't agree with ron paul on every
[02:02:33.280 --> 02:02:38.960]  facet of every nuance about 98 percent of ron paul i agree with about 98 percent of judge andrew
[02:02:38.960 --> 02:02:44.480]  and pauletano i agree with i agree with about 90 percent of what ventura says but i love his heart
[02:02:44.480 --> 02:02:52.480]  i agree with uh about 85 percent of what glenn beck says but the 15 percent is duplicitous
[02:02:52.480 --> 02:02:58.800]  and deceptive and there's that evil twinkle and in my gut churns and uh i would love to embrace
[02:02:58.800 --> 02:03:04.160]  glenn beck folks i've been offered big network radio jobs i've been offered big network tv jobs
[02:03:04.160 --> 02:03:11.680]  a decade ago okay i was and i know they you know tell all the girls this uh but you know you tell
[02:03:11.680 --> 02:03:19.040]  all the girls that but i mean i really was vetted and offered the era parent to rush limbaugh okay
[02:03:19.600 --> 02:03:24.160]  i mean i mean look at me now look at all the success we've had here without them without
[02:03:24.160 --> 02:03:29.120]  selling out so i could be where glenn beck is i could be making 45 million dollars a year
[02:03:30.240 --> 02:03:35.200]  but i don't care i mean the little bit of money i've got i can live in a comfortable house drive
[02:03:35.200 --> 02:03:41.840]  a car that doesn't break down wear clothes that are don't have holes in them after that i mean i
[02:03:41.840 --> 02:03:46.960]  love the analogy bob chaven's coming up the next segment the parable uh the
[02:03:50.080 --> 02:03:56.080]  oh what's the other term for it when you tell a story to describe something the point is allegory
[02:03:56.800 --> 02:04:03.440]  that uh they'll run this uses of would you sell your eyes for a thousand dollars and be blind
[02:04:03.440 --> 02:04:07.600]  would you sell it for a million a billion i mean you could say alex here is a trillion
[02:04:07.600 --> 02:04:12.400]  dollars sell your eyeballs be blind and i'd probably would do it and then try to give the
[02:04:12.400 --> 02:04:19.520]  money to charity but but i mean it would still be a hard decision and most people wouldn't i mean
[02:04:19.520 --> 02:04:24.000]  i'm somebody who is into self-sacrifice at a very primitive level i mean it's just it's what i
[02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:30.240]  believe in it's what floats my boat a challenging corruption challenging evil as a warrior just
[02:04:30.240 --> 02:04:35.520]  in my very programming is what i'm about but i mean you wouldn't sell your eyes for all the
[02:04:35.520 --> 02:04:40.480]  money in the world well what would you sell your soul for the eyes are just the wind of the soul
[02:04:40.480 --> 02:04:48.000]  i mean i can't be bought because it's impossible you understand i mean maybe if my children were
[02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:54.400]  starving uh but as soon as they weren't starving i would go and explain what had happened i mean
[02:04:54.400 --> 02:05:03.040]  it's just i cannot be bought i cannot be threatened alex jones here with urgent information concerning

[02:13:10.960 --> 02:13:16.640]  of the international forecaster dot com he joins us every friday and we really appreciate
[02:13:17.280 --> 02:13:22.720]  him coming on with us there's so much to talk about with the economy that i want to go over
[02:13:22.720 --> 02:13:29.200]  over but first off they admit in the washington post that this new banking regulatory reform
[02:13:29.200 --> 02:13:34.800]  is run by a office of the fellow reserve with unlimited power to take over any other institutions
[02:13:34.800 --> 02:13:41.200]  they want and that this is literally a banking dictatorship and separately grease is selling
[02:13:41.200 --> 02:13:46.720]  off their six hundred islands to the very bankers that sold them the derivatives i mean this is
[02:13:46.720 --> 02:13:54.320]  just too much bob Chapman well you're absolutely correct i have to say i saw the piece that you
[02:13:54.320 --> 02:13:59.680]  did on monday morning and i thought it was terrific i'll have it in tomorrow's the international
[02:13:59.680 --> 02:14:05.680]  forecaster regarding uh the false flag event known as the oil spill or oil slick or whatever you
[02:14:05.680 --> 02:14:13.040]  want to call it and uh it's too bad you did it so early because on tuesday uh they released
[02:14:13.040 --> 02:14:21.440]  information that vanguard which is a group of mutual funds and money managers had sold bp stock
[02:14:21.440 --> 02:14:30.480]  as well and just happens that uh the president has his accounts with vanguard did you hear that uh no
[02:14:30.480 --> 02:14:35.520]  i mean i knew a bunch of other funds were doing this breakdown meadow vanguard's one of the biggest
[02:14:35.520 --> 02:14:41.920]  mutual funds out there uh to tell us bob Chapman well very simply they sold off their bp and
[02:14:41.920 --> 02:14:50.400]  and they like the other two parties hayward of the ceo of uh bp and uh goman saxon who knows
[02:14:50.400 --> 02:14:57.840]  how many others we don't know about uh they sold off and uh it just so happens that the president
[02:14:57.840 --> 02:15:03.760]  has his money there so there's no such thing as coincidences so i would say in all probability
[02:15:03.760 --> 02:15:08.800]  they get a call and they someone said to them look you don't want to own this stock anymore get out
[02:15:08.800 --> 02:15:15.200]  of it don't ask any questions and we can't have the federal government investigate this uh record
[02:15:15.200 --> 02:15:21.120]  stock dumping by the bp ceo the week before record stock dumping uh in bp by goldman sax that the
[02:15:21.120 --> 02:15:26.000]  year before the chairman of goldman sax had also been the co-chair of bp that's how heavily invested
[02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:31.440]  they are in the ownership position one of the main ownership positions in bp and i've seen a bunch
[02:15:31.440 --> 02:15:36.240]  of other mutual funds that dumped the week before and now vanguard that holds the president's that
[02:15:36.240 --> 02:15:42.960]  bob that is amazing well i just did those coincidences that happened you know colonel
[02:15:42.960 --> 02:15:47.760]  proddy was talking about that as jesse just told us you know i learned when i was in counter
[02:15:47.760 --> 02:15:55.920]  intelligence there are no coincidences and jerry and um the jesse just bore that out and of course
[02:15:55.920 --> 02:16:04.960]  uh mr proddy did as well colonel proddy and uh it just so happens i was on uh doing an interview
[02:16:04.960 --> 02:16:16.320]  this morning again in athens which is going to be in a public uh television program and uh i spoke
[02:16:16.320 --> 02:16:26.640]  with the uh the reporter um the host or whatever you would call it uh about the sale of the islands
[02:16:26.640 --> 02:16:34.880]  and uh the i i kai what is that nikonos i think is the key one they want to sell first
[02:16:35.920 --> 02:16:43.920]  and uh i went through and discussed what i think about the greek situation and i gave them a list
[02:16:43.920 --> 02:16:59.360]  of builder burgers from the uh manufacturing banking uh bureaucrats politicians in greece who
[02:16:59.360 --> 02:17:04.320]  have attended these meetings which they didn't have and i told them what you know what these
[02:17:04.320 --> 02:17:14.640]  people are up to and i also uh told them specifically do not allow the government to sell off anything
[02:17:15.680 --> 02:17:20.480]  and of course i told them about pompandreo's background as a builder burger and as an alumnus
[02:17:21.360 --> 02:17:25.600]  and uh that'll be all over greece and and all over many other countries as well
[02:17:26.560 --> 02:17:32.480]  but the bottom line here is if we really want to hurt the alumnus in europe
[02:17:32.480 --> 02:17:42.080]  and worldwide for that matter what we gotta do is get greece to default on their debt
[02:17:42.720 --> 02:17:51.200]  leave the euro go back to the drachma and clean up their act like cut governmental expenses 30
[02:17:51.200 --> 02:17:58.640]  percent make the rich pay their taxes and don't increase taxes low of them because as kennedy
[02:17:58.640 --> 02:18:03.440]  knows they cut taxes about 50 percent and tax receipts double just like california's raised
[02:18:03.440 --> 02:18:08.960]  taxes and was in the la times a few weeks ago oh our money tax receipts went down we raised
[02:18:08.960 --> 02:18:15.760]  taxes they want to drive us into bankruptcy that's right and so that was the advice i gave them and
[02:18:15.760 --> 02:18:24.240]  i told them if greece does that the other four p i i gs known as pigs which are ireland spain
[02:18:24.240 --> 02:18:32.480]  uh italy and portugal they'll do the same thing and can you imagine the disruption that's gonna
[02:18:32.480 --> 02:18:38.880]  cause all the banks who are holding the bonds are going to go under we're talking deutch bank hypo bank
[02:18:38.880 --> 02:18:44.960]  and the governments are going to you know suffer grievously who are holding bonds as well in those
[02:18:44.960 --> 02:18:53.840]  countries like germany and france and the netherlands and austria and belgium and so the disruption
[02:18:53.840 --> 02:19:00.800]  will be enormous and i hope they go ahead and do it and i hope everybody in greece watches the program
[02:19:00.800 --> 02:19:07.520]  because there's nobody out there saying what you and i are saying but a handful of us and
[02:19:07.520 --> 02:19:14.960]  reflecting back to what you were talking about earlier about us affecting people in the way
[02:19:14.960 --> 02:19:21.840]  they think and telling them what's outside that box alexis is spreading all over the world and
[02:19:21.840 --> 02:19:27.360]  you know that but i had to say it because we're really affecting people in foreign countries
[02:19:28.320 --> 02:19:34.320]  oh i know i mean i can get off a fishing boat in honduras and people in bare feet are running up

[02:25:36.400 --> 02:25:44.480]  the hour big news splits coming up on the economy with bob but bob going back to you
[02:25:45.760 --> 02:25:49.280]  we've got mr veech who's been a frequent guest here uh
[02:25:49.280 --> 02:25:56.800]  uh grassroots journalist from scotland he went to g20 and he's in the Ottawa citizen today
[02:25:57.600 --> 02:26:03.360]  and he was very polite the police on the street wanted his id it says within five miles of
[02:26:03.360 --> 02:26:07.360]  anywhere downtown and he said i don't have to give that to you and so they arrested him
[02:26:07.840 --> 02:26:13.840]  and look what that fleshed out secret law lets police arrest for failing to show id near summit
[02:26:13.840 --> 02:26:18.560]  that's martial law and they talk about this being a form of martial law in the article
[02:26:18.560 --> 02:26:26.400]  and then separately first it was going to be 500 and 600 and now 1.2 billion for a three day g20 g8
[02:26:26.400 --> 02:26:32.320]  summit so when the real owners of america and canada in the world the bankers that you know the made
[02:26:32.320 --> 02:26:38.560]  off kin lay types that create the the derivatives fraud who are taking over islands literal private
[02:26:38.560 --> 02:26:46.640]  pension fund uh raiders are are in the news uh in this uh london guardian article with money
[02:26:46.640 --> 02:26:53.040]  they made off selling derivatives to greece now greece is selling them their own 600 islands
[02:26:53.040 --> 02:26:58.640]  to be private islands of the bankers it actually says that in the guardian as if it's a good thing
[02:26:58.640 --> 02:27:05.200]  and then one plus billion dollars for three days of security for these banking parasites to come
[02:27:05.200 --> 02:27:11.280]  into town and of course it turns out their companies have subsidiaries that are these private
[02:27:11.280 --> 02:27:17.040]  security firms and in pennsylvania at pittsburgh last year they allowed g20 private security
[02:27:17.040 --> 02:27:22.240]  they admitted this to snatch and grab citizens and put them in cars and drive them aware drive
[02:27:22.240 --> 02:27:29.840]  them away god knows where i mean this banking elite is a pack of scum what's your take on that bob
[02:27:31.120 --> 02:27:34.640]  exactly the same as yours and they're going to continue to be more aggressive
[02:27:34.640 --> 02:27:41.040]  of as time goes on because there's more and more people from different walks of life who are
[02:27:41.040 --> 02:27:45.680]  protesting the different things because they're finding out through talk radio as well as the
[02:27:45.680 --> 02:27:53.600]  internet and the more they do it the more people are going to come out it's just like uh if you
[02:27:53.600 --> 02:27:59.680]  watch the movie the patriot which i'm sure you did and one of the british officers would continue
[02:27:59.680 --> 02:28:07.920]  to indescribably murder and burn down homes of people who were favorable to the revolutionaries
[02:28:07.920 --> 02:28:16.800]  during the revolution in war and every time they did it it got worse because the first thing they
[02:28:16.800 --> 02:28:25.120]  did was in combat was to attack and kill all the offices that possible and so the same thing is
[02:28:25.120 --> 02:28:31.760]  going to happen in america and any other country that continues to do that sort of thing uh and
[02:28:31.760 --> 02:28:37.360]  they're looking for trouble and eventually they'll get it unfortunately because uh as time goes on
[02:28:38.160 --> 02:28:42.000]  unemployment's going to grow throughout the world and things are going to become much more
[02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:47.200]  difficult and people are going to become more desperate and so those things are going to snap
[02:28:47.200 --> 02:28:55.600]  back on their face but i'm glad that the gentleman confronted the police and say is that to them uh
[02:28:55.600 --> 02:29:01.520]  you can't do that and by the way he's on he's on next hour go ahead bob that's terrific
[02:29:02.160 --> 02:29:09.520]  he's the last time he was on ahead of me but anyway um that's great and i really enunciated
[02:29:09.520 --> 02:29:16.400]  and spoke quite a bit this morning in greece on this uh business of the sale of assets it's not
[02:29:16.400 --> 02:29:26.640]  only the islands they're after things like a water supply electricity um uh any kind of public utility
[02:29:26.640 --> 02:29:32.000]  a classic imf world bank robbery stay there bob long segment coming up let's get into the economy
[02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:36.000]  finish up with what's happening in greece and then get into some other issues but understand
[02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:42.480]  folks 1.2 billion and growing for three days of security and they're arresting canadians and others
[02:29:42.480 --> 02:29:49.920]  in brits and scotsman for no reason under a secret law that is bonafide authoritarian tyranny
[02:29:51.200 --> 02:29:57.920]  we're on the march the empire's on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:30:00.400 --> 02:30:04.960]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[02:30:04.960 --> 02:30:09.280]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[02:30:09.280 --> 02:30:14.320]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[02:30:14.320 --> 02:30:19.920]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[02:30:19.920 --> 02:30:25.040]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[02:30:25.040 --> 02:30:30.320]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous
[02:30:30.320 --> 02:30:34.960]  weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from
[02:30:34.960 --> 02:30:40.320]  weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and
[02:30:40.320 --> 02:30:44.720]  peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution from science

[02:33:02.720 --> 02:33:11.920]  he's going the distance he's going for speed she's all alone all alone in a time of need
[02:33:11.920 --> 02:33:18.560]  because he's racing and racing and playing the chords he's fighting and fighting and riding on
[02:33:18.560 --> 02:33:21.520]  his horse he's going the distance
[02:33:29.680 --> 02:33:35.520]  bob chatman is our guest he was trying to get into the situation in greece for those that don't know
[02:33:35.520 --> 02:33:42.240]  in 2002 thousands of pages of imf and world bank documents got leaked and in there it was their
[02:33:42.240 --> 02:33:48.480]  own documents stating what they do and then and they admitted that it was their documents and it's
[02:33:48.480 --> 02:33:54.400]  what we already understood them to be doing but here was the actual red-handed confession letters
[02:33:54.960 --> 02:33:59.840]  and they go in they pay off politicians they create big social welfare systems they advertise it
[02:33:59.840 --> 02:34:04.640]  to the media that the public deserves all this to get them dependent to grow the size of the state
[02:34:04.640 --> 02:34:09.840]  so the public's domesticated independent like a chicken that lives in a chicken farm inside a cage
[02:34:09.840 --> 02:34:15.520]  not a wild chicken running around outside and join itself sleeping in a tree you're now a slave
[02:34:15.520 --> 02:34:21.040]  and then they come in and bankrupt the economy in waves and then they seize the water they seize
[02:34:21.040 --> 02:34:27.200]  the power then they jack up the prices and and and put carbon taxes on it that's the new layer
[02:34:27.200 --> 02:34:32.480]  to this and so the entire infrastructure of greece and there are one crop economy that being
[02:34:32.480 --> 02:34:38.400]  turdism that's now being seized but what was so incredible about this was reading in the london
[02:34:39.520 --> 02:34:45.840]  guardian story that i covered during the first hour today this report right here it said that
[02:34:45.840 --> 02:34:49.680]  instead of going to the imf and world bank and the article is written like it's a good thing
[02:34:49.680 --> 02:34:57.120]  they're going right to billionaire hedge fund leaders sir richard branson billionaire barclay
[02:34:57.120 --> 02:35:04.320]  brothers you know the Aristotle you know they they mentioned all these other elitist owned islands so
[02:35:04.320 --> 02:35:10.560]  it's it's normal that these other elite families want this and so it says that all these big owners
[02:35:10.560 --> 02:35:15.760]  of brokerage firms that sold the derivatives that destroyed Greece now the country's forced to go to
[02:35:15.760 --> 02:35:22.560]  them to sell them islands that were for tourists and to now make it their own private islands i
[02:35:22.560 --> 02:35:28.320]  mean this is a new level where the very criminals that carried out the operations to implode the
[02:35:28.320 --> 02:35:35.200]  economy now get the land itself i mean soon it'll be like it's your wife you've got to deliver your
[02:35:35.200 --> 02:35:42.720]  wife if they want them to the banker go ahead bob shabbon well i think you're pretty well
[02:35:42.720 --> 02:35:49.040]  capsized it i think the only thing you left out is that not only on all the utilities and things
[02:35:49.040 --> 02:35:55.040]  that people use in the country which they go into the imf um they never repair anything it all breaks
[02:35:55.040 --> 02:36:00.480]  down and then the people in the country get very disturbed because you know the water cost three
[02:36:00.480 --> 02:36:07.440]  times what it used to like in bolivia and uh and people can't afford it anymore in the whole system
[02:36:07.440 --> 02:36:14.880]  isn't even working and they just suck every bit of profit they can out of it leave it to fall apart
[02:36:14.880 --> 02:36:22.480]  and then sit around bragging and writing books about how we're scum and how they want to save the
[02:36:22.480 --> 02:36:29.280]  earth by killing us that's for sure and they love telling us about it in their publications
[02:36:31.520 --> 02:36:36.800]  you know going back to this though bob i mean this needs to be investigated 1.2 billion for
[02:36:36.800 --> 02:36:42.480]  three days of security for the heads of the central government banks and private banks to
[02:36:42.480 --> 02:36:47.520]  show up and talk about how they're going to rape us next i mean this this is definitely a payoff as
[02:36:47.520 --> 02:36:54.960]  well i mean this is an in secret laws that they can arrest you for no reason in canada now i mean
[02:36:54.960 --> 02:37:01.120]  i noticed a long time ago that canada is is like nazi germany but the canadiens don't know it
[02:37:01.840 --> 02:37:06.000]  well you're absolutely right i lived up there and i've been there many many times
[02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:14.000]  although i haven't been up there for about eight years but uh it was oppressive and it's a very
[02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:22.960]  expensive to live there i thought it was about 30 more expensive than los angeles which is certainly
[02:37:22.960 --> 02:37:30.800]  not an inexpensive city and uh and so i i think they've got their hands full uh because a long
[02:37:30.800 --> 02:37:38.960]  long ago uh both major parties sold out and you have the same kind of aluminous group of people
[02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:44.880]  that are running the country that are running that type is running many other countries
[02:37:46.720 --> 02:37:51.840]  well it certainly is on other issues i'm going to be covering this uh at the start of the next
[02:37:51.840 --> 02:37:58.560]  hour in detail this is really is our top story today oil industry insider and cfr member predicts
[02:37:58.560 --> 02:38:05.040]  gulf evacuation this is a info wars dot com curtain immo article uh but matthew Simmons founder and
[02:38:05.040 --> 02:38:13.520]  chairman emeritus of simons and company international who's also cfr member uh told the washington post
[02:38:13.520 --> 02:38:18.560]  and they also have a major meteorologist telling the bolton war son that it looks like these tropical
[02:38:18.560 --> 02:38:23.520]  storms and hurricanes that are now starting are going to blow the oil in the next few weeks or
[02:38:23.520 --> 02:38:30.320]  months uh depending on the brakes into the gulf coast and that the oil there's so many
[02:38:31.440 --> 02:38:36.080]  you know bordering on 100 million gallons it was 60 something million a few weeks ago
[02:38:36.080 --> 02:38:42.320]  out there that's all going to blow in and back up in the rivers and streams uh and that it's
[02:38:42.320 --> 02:38:48.640]  offgassing all these toxins and now i do see the epa saying limited areas may have to be evacuated
[02:38:48.640 --> 02:38:55.680]  but he's saying quote what you're going to have to evacuate the gulf states can you imagine evacuating
[02:38:55.680 --> 02:39:01.200]  20 million people this story is 80 times worse than i thought and then we separately have methane
[02:39:01.200 --> 02:39:06.800]  and gulf astonishingly high u.s scientist says now that's roiders and so they're talking about
[02:39:06.800 --> 02:39:13.920]  it blowing in land and and just causing hell on earth uh so then you look at the evidence of
[02:39:13.920 --> 02:39:21.120]  this being staged by bp which is mounting uh what's your take on that bob well i think if
[02:39:21.120 --> 02:39:30.000]  they can't make this evacuation along the coastline of that whole periphery uh i think what they'll
[02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:36.800]  do is use cia planes uh to drop something that's going to make these people pretty ill and i i
[02:39:36.800 --> 02:39:43.600]  think they want to clear that area and uh and do a job on it and i think that might be a reflection
[02:39:43.600 --> 02:39:51.280]  of what they were really up to when i think they directed that hurricane uh into new allons several
[02:39:51.280 --> 02:39:56.800]  years ago we had meteorologists on how it just sat there and waited and didn't and had two eyes and
[02:39:56.800 --> 02:40:00.720]  didn't behave like other ones and i've had the father of weather weapons been living son on
[02:40:00.720 --> 02:40:07.280]  that's even in roiders ap fox news that they had certified the creation of hurricanes the
[02:40:07.280 --> 02:40:12.000]  steering of hurricanes the killing of hurricanes the weakening of hurricanes whatever they wanted
[02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:19.840]  by 1967 they were doing it in 1960 62 but by 67 it was certified by the naval weapons laboratory
[02:40:19.840 --> 02:40:25.200]  and stanford research institute that they had total control of the weather in limited areas
[02:40:26.480 --> 02:40:32.400]  and that's true and they started the program the same year the russians did in 1956 and the
[02:40:32.400 --> 02:40:39.200]  reason i know that is that we used to intercept that stuff well that's actually what uh
[02:40:39.200 --> 02:40:45.120]  uh ben levingston said and we can only interview him it was it was declassified you know five years
[02:40:45.120 --> 02:40:49.600]  ago it wasn't in the news i saw the declassification it was sent to me online a link to the national
[02:40:49.600 --> 02:40:53.920]  archives after we interviewed levingston and got picked up by fox ap and others but he could
[02:40:53.920 --> 02:40:59.440]  finally talk about it he was running a uh weather seating uh outfit out of the panhandle at the
[02:40:59.440 --> 02:41:05.280]  time and uh he's really a famous guy but never never talk about it uh he's the guy that first
[02:41:05.280 --> 02:41:11.600]  flew into typhoons in the late 40s uh you know which of course are hurricanes but in the pacific
[02:41:11.600 --> 02:41:16.560]  so they go up to 250 miles an hour not just 200 uh he was the first guy he was the guy that led
[02:41:16.560 --> 02:41:21.680]  squadrons in vietnam i mean leading squadrons and he'd of course been a pilot in world war two and
[02:41:21.680 --> 02:41:27.600]  this is a real the real deal folks uh let's talk about like a chuck yeager type uh he'd been a fighter
[02:41:27.600 --> 02:41:32.720]  pilot in world war two uh then a meteorologist once the navy put him through that then he led
[02:41:32.720 --> 02:41:38.160]  squadrons uh for what was it five years on hundreds and hundreds of missions uh creating
[02:41:38.160 --> 02:41:43.360]  storms over vietnam flooding them then he certified all the weapons systems just amazing individual
[02:41:44.480 --> 02:41:50.000]  well you know it's uh interesting that he did all that and you know one step further if you
[02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:58.400]  remember back during that time of vietnam and the war all they had to do was bomb the dykes
[02:41:58.400 --> 02:42:04.000]  in northern uh in north uh in north vietnam and the world would have been over with
[02:42:08.160 --> 02:42:13.920]  body was as simple as that in the north they had dykes and they held back the water
[02:42:14.560 --> 02:42:17.520]  and all you had to do was go to bomb them and it would have flooded high pong
[02:42:18.960 --> 02:42:24.960]  great point we're going to go to anti-federalist sharky george brian helga uh and others here
[02:42:24.960 --> 02:42:31.280]  in just a moment bob Chapman of the international forecaster dot com uh is our guest but i wanted
[02:42:31.280 --> 02:42:36.080]  to go to this washington post article today now ron paul's covered it you've covered it at nauseam
[02:42:36.080 --> 02:42:40.480]  judge depolitano here on this show you know not just alex jones's opinion i've read the bill
[02:42:41.200 --> 02:42:47.280]  or to be accurate scanned over it it's very long haven't read the whole thing but it says and the
[02:42:47.280 --> 02:42:51.760]  texas banking association president did two months ago they had a big article it was published all
[02:42:51.760 --> 02:42:56.080]  over texas where they said this is the same big banks this is texas banking association that
[02:42:56.080 --> 02:43:00.720]  created the derivatives you know the big six and they're going to take over your healthy local
[02:43:00.720 --> 02:43:05.200]  state banks and this is a consolidation and they control the regulators well here's the
[02:43:05.200 --> 02:43:10.640]  washington post a new consumer protection bureau housed in the fellow reserve the very group that's
[02:43:10.640 --> 02:43:16.400]  engineered this would have independent funding an independent leader and near total anonymity
[02:43:16.400 --> 02:43:22.640]  an autonomy autonomy to write and enforce rules the government would have broad new powers to
[02:43:22.640 --> 02:43:29.040]  seize and wind down large financial firms that's healthy firms and to oversee the 600 trillion
[02:43:29.040 --> 02:43:33.440]  now they admit 600 trillion well that's the first time i've seen that uh derivatives market
[02:43:33.440 --> 02:43:43.280]  in addition um a council of regulators headed by the treasury uh secretary would monitor the
[02:43:43.280 --> 02:43:50.000]  financial landscape for potential seismic risk and as napolitano said from a hotdog stand up to
[02:43:50.560 --> 02:43:57.040]  you know your local bank this is a financial dictatorship the same austerity rules and power
[02:43:57.040 --> 02:44:02.880]  they just gave them over in uh grease to rob everyone bob Chapman this is unbelievable
[02:44:02.880 --> 02:44:08.880]  that they would even admit this in the washington post 600 trillion we talked about it here two
[02:44:08.880 --> 02:44:16.000]  months ago we knew it was coming they're going to take over the sec and the cftc and the fdic
[02:44:17.040 --> 02:44:23.440]  it's a financial dictatorship no question and how do you solve that well you wait until it
[02:44:23.440 --> 02:44:29.440]  comes unglued then you point the finger and then you bring in laura in order and try these people
[02:44:31.200 --> 02:44:36.480]  but we won't do that we'll just worship the bankers and thank them for everything and and
[02:44:36.480 --> 02:44:40.640]  again bank i always call them bankers they're not bankers the people down the street that loan
[02:44:40.640 --> 02:44:45.520]  you money that's part of the free market it's good you know they're good bad and ugly it's a
[02:44:45.520 --> 02:44:50.640]  variant but the local banks are good on average and they're being honest about what's happening
[02:44:50.640 --> 02:44:57.280]  but these mega six banks they're not bankers they create derivative fraud just like bernie
[02:44:57.280 --> 02:45:02.000]  made off the founder of nasdaq i mean you know he's one of them he's one of their icons and they
[02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:06.800]  sell it to the world and then when they implode it they get control of your life and it's all for nothing
[02:45:06.800 --> 02:45:11.840]  it's literally a parlor trick i mean it's like somebody stands up on a mountaintop and says i'm
[02:45:11.840 --> 02:45:17.200]  god give me the world i have a checkbook here's a here's you know a 600 trillion in the world says
[02:45:17.200 --> 02:45:24.000]  you are our god you made it up i mean it's just so incredible bob it certainly is and you know
[02:45:24.560 --> 02:45:28.880]  the public just doesn't know when i'm talking about people with college educations
[02:45:28.880 --> 02:45:36.240]  who just never simply studied this they they don't know unless they listen to us will we simply
[02:45:36.240 --> 02:45:43.600]  outline exactly what these people are up to and how they're breaking not only the laws of the
[02:45:43.600 --> 02:45:52.480]  country but the moral laws as well well i couldn't say it better than you bob and it's all coming
[02:45:52.480 --> 02:45:56.960]  to a head and the system now as we talked about five weeks ago brazinski said look the world's
[02:45:56.960 --> 02:46:03.600]  awake to our new old order we're in trouble and so they they're just going for broke but i really
[02:46:03.600 --> 02:46:08.320]  more every day realize if we just stand up speak out keep moving forward we're going to beat these
[02:46:08.320 --> 02:46:14.080]  people in the end time is on our side well i agree the longer it takes the more people
[02:46:14.080 --> 02:46:20.640]  we're going to inform and that's that's really important and the the people we want to inform
[02:46:20.640 --> 02:46:29.360]  more than any other other people between 40 and 65 who don't know what we know and they these people
[02:46:29.360 --> 02:46:38.160]  have a great stake in the country they vote usually and it's very important that they understand
[02:46:38.160 --> 02:46:46.080]  the truth what we're telling them and they're all going to eventually act like we are and
[02:46:46.080 --> 02:46:52.640]  we'll stop this it's going to be very very painful we'll probably have another war probably
[02:46:52.640 --> 02:46:58.160]  millions of people are going to get killed uh you know and it's hard to say that out of hand
[02:46:58.160 --> 02:47:04.320]  but that's what these people have planned for us you know have no mistake this is where this is
[02:47:04.320 --> 02:47:09.680]  headed i want to go to calls bob but i really want that to sink in what you just said for people
[02:47:09.680 --> 02:47:15.280]  that have children people that have families i mean they're openly on the news saying they're
[02:47:15.280 --> 02:47:21.360]  trying to pass legislation or any citizens they want for any reason non-terror related as well
[02:47:22.960 --> 02:47:26.960]  see first it's for terror and then it's for everybody can be secretly arrested and tortured
[02:47:27.520 --> 02:47:34.880]  i mean that is the most hardcore baseline tyranny there is that's the royal flush the end of posse
[02:47:34.880 --> 02:47:40.640]  commentatus the end of habeas corpus the end of everything i mean this is the open takeover of the
[02:47:40.640 --> 02:47:46.000]  internet the open takeover of your local banks the open takeover and federalization of your police
[02:47:46.640 --> 02:47:52.480]  canada's falling to tyranny with secret arrest the mainstream news secret law let's police arrest
[02:47:52.480 --> 02:47:58.960]  for no reason i mean you know that's the ladies and gentlemen this isn't a drill and i don't think
[02:47:58.960 --> 02:48:03.360]  people i mean take the gulf situation whether it's whether this oil is going to come into
[02:48:03.360 --> 02:48:08.480]  shore and is going to be deadly or not the cfr and the washington post is now putting up trial
[02:48:08.480 --> 02:48:13.760]  balloons about total marshal law and 20 to 40 million people being forced to evacuate
[02:48:14.320 --> 02:48:19.360]  they're now actually starting to put this out there i mean they're hitting us from all sides and
[02:48:19.360 --> 02:48:23.920]  all the evidence points towards this bp thing being staged i mean i wish that wasn't true
[02:48:24.800 --> 02:48:28.720]  but we're not going to get out of this with wishful thinking okay folks we're gonna have to
[02:48:28.720 --> 02:48:33.280]  really face how evil our enemy is and how they've hijacked our government how they wrap themselves
[02:48:33.280 --> 02:48:38.320]  in the flag how they brainwash the police and the police better choose sides i mean you better
[02:48:38.320 --> 02:48:44.400]  look in the mirror police i mean is that america secret arrest or whoever you want torture is america
[02:48:44.400 --> 02:48:48.480]  foreign banks telling congress they won't say where the trillions went foreign offshore banks
[02:48:48.480 --> 02:48:52.640]  being able to shut down whatever financial institutions they want i mean is that really
[02:48:52.640 --> 02:48:57.840]  what you in history want to sign on to all you care about your beer going out and partying
[02:48:57.840 --> 02:49:03.520]  after you get off the government bureaucrats judges media people all of you everybody
[02:49:03.520 --> 02:49:08.560]  all of you that passively go along with this you know whether you're a soccer mom or a doctor
[02:49:08.560 --> 02:49:14.240]  or a lawyer or a professor or a yuppie you better get up off your hind ends and speak up now and
[02:49:14.240 --> 02:49:19.040]  don't tell me oh you don't know this stuff's true don't don't punt don't psychologically you know
[02:49:19.040 --> 02:49:24.800]  see oh well who knows if that's true you know it's true you better be counted now you better choose
[02:49:24.800 --> 02:49:29.680]  sides and stand up now you're only alive once we're at a crossroads here folks we're going to win
[02:49:29.680 --> 02:49:34.480]  this thing one way or the other but the more you stand up now the better we're going to be here
[02:49:34.480 --> 02:49:38.400]  i mean we could actually have the globalist back off and then try to creep back later
[02:49:38.400 --> 02:49:42.400]  and whether that'd be a less decisive victory i'd rather have it that way for now bob shabbon
[02:49:43.120 --> 02:49:49.200]  i agree completely anything that will avoid a violence and you know you and i get uh
[02:49:49.200 --> 02:49:54.080]  blasphemed all the time for saying well all we want is violence and that's the last thing we want
[02:49:54.720 --> 02:49:59.120]  that's why i tell people kick them all out of office in november and maybe we get a shot
[02:49:59.120 --> 02:50:04.640]  at turning this thing around it's least it's a step in the direct right direction and of course you
[02:50:04.640 --> 02:50:11.360]  guys all of you out there you got to help us absolutely bob shabbon we're going to come back

[02:55:14.000 --> 02:55:24.640]  really glad i did so alex uh i'm just so um you know i just wish we would have every country
[02:55:24.640 --> 02:55:30.320]  would have a steam engine like you well i'm i'm pretty obnoxious but i get the job done
[02:55:31.280 --> 02:55:35.600]  i don't think you're obnoxious haha we're a sweetheart thanks for it all
[02:55:35.600 --> 02:55:45.600]  actually uh just before i left they even told that the german government has to send their
[02:55:45.600 --> 02:55:55.040]  household budget to the imf to be approved uh tablet didn't talk about and i don't i don't
[02:55:55.040 --> 02:56:01.120]  know if anybody else has talked about but that's the last thing i heard uh before i left three
[02:56:01.120 --> 02:56:12.560]  weeks ago and you know i mean germany is only half as much in debt as uh trees so but the imf
[02:56:12.560 --> 02:56:19.200]  you know has been there a long time everything is being privatized all the german cities all the
[02:56:19.200 --> 02:56:25.360]  communities are bankrupt germany never got out from underneath the uh marshal planet it's been a
[02:56:25.360 --> 02:56:30.560]  corporate colony since then and now all of us go under this corporate uh board bob had you heard
[02:56:30.560 --> 02:56:38.240]  about what helga's mentioning no i haven't and uh but i can imagine what surprises me is helga
[02:56:38.240 --> 02:56:46.720]  says that the uh you know the local uh cities and towns and and uh counties are having financial
[02:56:46.720 --> 02:56:56.480]  problems as well and that to me is surprising totally bankrupt my city where i was born it
[02:56:56.480 --> 02:57:04.720]  even the graveyard is bank is uh privatized and on top of it there are lost billions on
[02:57:04.720 --> 02:57:11.520]  liman brother i mean there are uh it's just absolutely and i have been fighting there
[02:57:11.520 --> 02:57:18.160]  whole year against privatization of the last things to which was the buses and people just
[02:57:18.160 --> 02:57:24.800]  don't know about the imf i mean it's uh they have been working behind the curtains for a long time
[02:57:24.800 --> 02:57:30.560]  privatization is not privatization to boil it down for new viewers and listeners it is private
[02:57:30.560 --> 02:57:35.520]  corporations becoming government and charging you a lot more money for it and stealing the
[02:57:35.520 --> 02:57:45.760]  infrastructure that the people paid for right and they do no repair and if it's totally broken i
[02:57:45.760 --> 02:57:51.760]  guess they're going to give it back to the people again something like it i don't know maybe not
[02:57:51.760 --> 02:57:57.200]  maybe then just everything for it to cost what was that bum maybe the people will take it back
[02:57:58.960 --> 02:58:08.480]  uh i i i mean so far every city in germany is broke everything there are also no jobs around
[02:58:08.480 --> 02:58:15.600]  then you know we have this government handout which makes everybody paralyzed and that's why
[02:58:15.600 --> 02:58:19.840]  you're broke that's why hell gets so good erin from me i've seen hell go over the years out of

[03:00:43.360 --> 03:00:48.720]  bob chatman he joins us every friday of course his website's the international forecaster
[03:00:48.720 --> 03:00:53.760]  dot com amazing info there and we of course have info wars dot com anti federalists you're on the
[03:00:53.760 --> 03:01:03.760]  air thanks for holding hey are you there yes sir okay um i'll end my question for bob bob what
[03:01:03.760 --> 03:01:09.680]  of white gold and if the world were to come into armageddon okay i know that gold's been
[03:01:09.680 --> 03:01:15.520]  traded for centuries and used used for economies but how is it going to do me any good if the
[03:01:15.520 --> 03:01:22.400]  world really were to go into armageddon and how can i possibly afford a substantial amount
[03:01:22.400 --> 03:01:28.880]  to actually make a difference in my own life um and also if you could please explain hdr 192
[03:01:29.520 --> 03:01:33.760]  and how the constitution says no state shall accept anything other than gold and silver
[03:01:33.760 --> 03:01:39.120]  as tender and payment of debt and how now we cannot pay for anything because we have no money
[03:01:39.120 --> 03:01:42.800]  okay anti federalist uh i want to make some comments but first bob
[03:01:42.800 --> 03:01:53.600]  um well i i think that uh as far as the uh hd or whatever the uh name of the bill was uh is
[03:01:53.600 --> 03:02:00.320]  concerned uh you know that's been on the books for a long time and government just ignores it
[03:02:01.200 --> 03:02:07.200]  they just very simply do what they want to do and as far as armageddon is concerned if
[03:02:07.200 --> 03:02:14.480]  armageddon comes and nobody's gonna have anything in the way i interpret it and so if you worried
[03:02:14.480 --> 03:02:20.720]  about that it's more important you have food and water and a way to show to you what well we we
[03:02:20.720 --> 03:02:27.040]  haven't talked about gold yet today and uh gold is just one of the things farms food water friends
[03:02:27.040 --> 03:02:33.520]  skills uh having a plan so when so an emergency happens a meteorite nuclear war world war three
[03:02:33.520 --> 03:02:38.960]  uh evacuations that you're not dependent on government because look at katrina and every
[03:02:38.960 --> 03:02:47.200]  other disaster they can't and won't help you bob that's right let me briefly comment what i really
[03:02:47.200 --> 03:02:52.640]  heard there and we all give into this is kind of this psychological attitude of the world's going
[03:02:52.640 --> 03:02:57.360]  to hell so i might as well go drink a bunch of beer and eat cheese enchiladas and smoke cigarettes
[03:02:57.360 --> 03:03:02.160]  and i've done that before in my life uh you know a lot of the government's threatened to kill me and
[03:03:02.160 --> 03:03:05.760]  this will never you know what i don't care i'm gonna go eat a bunch of enchiladas and drink eight
[03:03:05.760 --> 03:03:12.400]  eight dosekis um you can't have that attitude you know the the end of the world could be next
[03:03:12.400 --> 03:03:17.440]  month i don't think it is but let's say it was do the right thing now live your life is gold a silver
[03:03:17.440 --> 03:03:23.600]  bullet is gold the pantheon to save the whole world no it's just better than fiat money it's
[03:03:23.600 --> 03:03:28.720]  better than fiat stocks and bonds and derivatives and things that are questionable and and that can
[03:03:28.720 --> 03:03:34.320]  be revoked or devalued with the stroke of a pin or in the twinkling of an eye or over time with
[03:03:34.320 --> 03:03:41.120]  gradual inflation and devaluation of currency and so you know there's always this cop out you see
[03:03:41.120 --> 03:03:43.920]  in the christian church well the end of the world's coming so i'm not going to go out and warn my
[03:03:43.920 --> 03:03:48.800]  neighbors about the takeover and the microchips and the police state and the fluoride in the water
[03:03:48.800 --> 03:03:52.320]  and i've been hearing that for 15 16 years since i've been active i know you've been hearing it for
[03:03:52.320 --> 03:03:56.880]  50 bob when you come back i want you to briefly speak to it but this caller you know what he said
[03:03:56.880 --> 03:04:01.840]  pretty much encompasses it all of course you could die in a car wreck today and have a safety
[03:04:01.840 --> 03:04:07.520]  deposit box full of gold and never use it you could die in a car wreck and not use 10 million
[03:04:07.520 --> 03:04:12.960]  dollars in stocks and bonds people may hypothetically have out there i mean what does that mean or
[03:04:12.960 --> 03:04:18.560]  the government in 1933 under war powers act you know confiscated gold yeah my grandmother
[03:04:18.560 --> 03:04:24.000]  remembers her father not turning his in in dallas and my grandfather remembered his dad who owned
[03:04:24.000 --> 03:04:28.400]  a car dealership not turning it in and people just buried it that's the old you know the old
[03:04:28.400 --> 03:04:32.800]  mason jar thing and they did well a year later after the gold confiscation when the government
[03:04:32.800 --> 03:04:37.040]  doubled the price because they the bankers had hoarded it so i mean just because the government
[03:04:37.040 --> 03:04:41.120]  might take your house don't have a house the government might take your kids never have kids
[03:04:41.120 --> 03:04:46.080]  the government you know uh you if you get your wife pregnant the baby might have a medical problem
[03:04:46.080 --> 03:04:51.040]  so let's not have a baby oh i might have a wreck on the highway so i won't drive my car that's called

[03:09:14.480 --> 03:09:17.840]  i mean if people got the attitude it's the end of the world i mean that's crazy
[03:09:18.480 --> 03:09:24.080]  it's the end of the world if we keep being helpless and stop taking action but people
[03:09:24.080 --> 03:09:28.320]  are taking action and they are getting food and water and trying to become more self-sufficient
[03:09:28.320 --> 03:09:32.880]  and planting gardens and not watching as much television and not drinking fluoridated water
[03:09:32.880 --> 03:09:37.360]  i mean all of that is just about getting healthier and we've had it good so long we're
[03:09:37.360 --> 03:09:43.280]  standing up against tyranny so we don't lose it bob shatman well that's exactly right and uh
[03:09:43.280 --> 03:09:49.920]  uh that kind of attitude ends up and why don't you just as you said jump off a cliff so you can't
[03:09:49.920 --> 03:09:55.840]  answer those questions because they're unanswerable uh we know what to do uh we've seen other societies
[03:09:56.720 --> 03:10:02.320]  over the centuries what they've done and so you put your food away dehydrated and freeze drive
[03:10:02.320 --> 03:10:08.000]  you get a filter and you're able to defend your family and then if you got money left over uh
[03:10:08.000 --> 03:10:14.640]  then you give mitis a call and uh get yourself some golden silver coins and in that process
[03:10:14.640 --> 03:10:20.720]  get yourself a free uh one-year subscription to the international forecaster that's all you have
[03:10:20.720 --> 03:10:26.640]  to do is call in and ask you buy one coin and you're off and running and speaking i ever heard
[03:10:26.640 --> 03:10:33.120]  of and speaking of mitis uh ted anderson is out in the field today uh doing research um but he
[03:10:33.120 --> 03:10:36.800]  does that all over the country and even goes to europe uh ted had a lot of gold and silver
[03:10:36.800 --> 03:10:43.280]  secured before gold went up the 50 plus dollars it has in the last few weeks i just called him
[03:10:43.280 --> 03:10:46.720]  randomly to get him on air because he's out of town i don't even know if he's been able to keep
[03:10:46.720 --> 03:10:51.840]  the lower prices he had uh but it's been slowly inching up but these are deals that have not been
[03:10:51.840 --> 03:10:57.440]  lasting but he uh has got a lot of coins that nobody else can even get a hold of because he's
[03:10:57.440 --> 03:11:02.560]  been in business for over 30 years ted anderson briefly tell people about today's mitis resources
[03:11:02.560 --> 03:11:08.960]  offer uh and the free international forecaster offer with a fifth of an ounce frank well one of
[03:11:08.960 --> 03:11:14.880]  the things that i am holding is that that frank coin it's at 265 right now even my internet prices
[03:11:14.880 --> 03:11:21.440]  have gone up over 270 i know i have competition out there that haven't priced over 300 so um yeah
[03:11:21.440 --> 03:11:25.360]  that's a good buy i mean especially if you consider the fact that you get a full year of bob
[03:11:25.360 --> 03:11:30.400]  chatman's international forecaster newsletter um you're getting the information that really you
[03:11:30.400 --> 03:11:36.000]  need to have in order to make sound investment decisions but you're also getting a piece of gold
[03:11:36.000 --> 03:11:40.400]  that quite literally can be traded back into currency if you want to recover the money that
[03:11:40.400 --> 03:11:45.920]  you invested uh anytime in the future you want to you just pick up the phone call us or go to
[03:11:45.920 --> 03:11:50.640]  any gold dealer across the united states for that matter that's how liquid this stuff is
[03:11:50.640 --> 03:11:57.680]  i am still also holding the silver walking liberty half down at 975 now silver today jumped up over
[03:11:57.680 --> 03:12:05.600]  19 dollars an ounce in 1917 and of course gold's peak today was 1259 dollars and 50 cents and
[03:12:05.600 --> 03:12:12.000]  presently right now in the marketplace is trading at 1255 40 uh alex i still have those buffalos
[03:12:12.720 --> 03:12:17.840]  had a lot of people purchased the quantities that i have but i still have some left and that coin
[03:12:17.840 --> 03:12:22.880]  is typically you know you can't even get it i mean i wasn't able to sell them most of the time
[03:12:22.880 --> 03:12:28.640]  all of last year and the gold market is seeing peaks that it's never seen before in the summertime
[03:12:28.640 --> 03:12:35.280]  which is also unheard of and like you said earlier this is the summer the fall is yet to come and
[03:12:35.280 --> 03:12:41.600]  that seasonably is when gold usually hits its peaks so just you know if we have just did you know
[03:12:41.600 --> 03:12:48.480]  a general run like we usually do we'll probably see that 13 14 perhaps even 1500 dollars an ounce
[03:12:48.480 --> 03:12:54.480]  coming into the fall bob chairman i'm sure has more to say about that but yeah the buffalo the
[03:12:54.480 --> 03:12:58.960]  even the u.s. eagle the bags of junk silver there's so many things they can be getting
[03:12:58.960 --> 03:13:04.880]  involved with here in the gold and silver market you know and be able to trade it privately i just
[03:13:04.880 --> 03:13:10.480]  can't say enough for it i mean like bob said if you have your guns your ammunition your food you're
[03:13:10.480 --> 03:13:16.080]  prepared for a problem in the future financially you have to get your house in order to and that's
[03:13:16.080 --> 03:13:22.080]  why it's very important to take advantage of this international forecaster frank offer and the frank
[03:13:22.080 --> 03:13:26.880]  coin is a fifth of an ounce of gold it's been trading throughout europe for hundreds of years
[03:13:26.880 --> 03:13:31.680]  people understand what that coin is it doesn't matter what kind of economic future we have
[03:13:31.680 --> 03:13:36.080]  whether even if we have great economic times coming nothing's still going to hold value
[03:13:36.080 --> 03:13:40.880]  because gold has held value for over 6000 years i mean i don't know how you can go wrong with that
[03:13:40.880 --> 03:13:46.560]  well absolutely ted anderson and we need to give people the toll free number to call and take
[03:13:46.560 --> 03:13:55.600]  advantage of this 800 686 2237 800 686 2237 and the brokers will be there throughout the weekend

[03:14:34.800 --> 03:14:46.160]  as well about the type of tyranny that we are facing as a society now in the in the 45 minutes
[03:14:46.160 --> 03:14:56.080]  that we have left here we're going to go to canada and talk to a gentleman who's in the
[03:14:56.080 --> 03:15:01.840]  auto a citizen today who was arrested when the police came over and wanted to interrogate him
[03:15:01.840 --> 03:15:06.080]  because he wouldn't answer their questions and now just like communist china is an arrestable
[03:15:06.080 --> 03:15:11.440]  offense uh to not answer their questions and it says secret law let's police arrest we're
[03:15:11.440 --> 03:15:16.960]  failing to show id near summit and this has got canadian civil liberties association saying this
[03:15:16.960 --> 03:15:23.440]  is extremely concerned and authoritarian well i mean separately we've got uh bills in congress
[03:15:23.440 --> 03:15:28.160]  to secretly arrest citizens and let us disappear into a black hole for any reason the government
[03:15:28.160 --> 03:15:35.200]  wishes no judge no jury i mean this is as massive a tyranny as you can imagine so we'll be covering
[03:15:35.200 --> 03:15:40.080]  that and taking your phone calls but we will cover what's happening at the g20 and the g8
[03:15:40.720 --> 03:15:46.160]  meeting 1.2 billion dollars is what it's costing for three days i mean this is the bankers and of
[03:15:46.160 --> 03:15:52.560]  course we'll pay interest to the bankers on the money we use to pay for this and this is also
[03:15:52.560 --> 03:15:57.760]  being contributed to by the u.s. government the share that canada's paying us 1.2 billion
[03:15:57.760 --> 03:16:02.560]  yes that's more than the entire budget of the city of austin close to the budget of a city like
[03:16:02.560 --> 03:16:08.240]  dallas in three days in a canadian city and it's as big as that canadian city's budget
[03:16:08.240 --> 03:16:15.360]  this is the out of control looting and robbery that is going on to guard the bankers that are robbing
[03:16:15.360 --> 03:16:24.480]  us so they just get it coming and going now my friends we have covered in the last 60 plus days
[03:16:24.480 --> 03:16:32.160]  is what has happened in the gulf since april 20th 2010 we've covered the fact that all these big
[03:16:32.160 --> 03:16:41.040]  brokerage firms and now vanguard that obama is invested in they dumped their stock right before
[03:16:41.040 --> 03:16:51.360]  bp 44 percent the uh the golden sacks dumped 44 percent of that the bp uh ceo dumped more than
[03:16:51.360 --> 03:16:57.120]  a third of his stock the week before we know about the recovery efforts being blocked we know all of
[03:16:57.120 --> 03:17:05.680]  this is going on and we know that obama is now trying to pass a carbon tax uh in the name of
[03:17:05.680 --> 03:17:10.080]  fixing this but as jesse ventura agreed with me a few hours ago here live on the show what does a
[03:17:10.080 --> 03:17:18.400]  tax have to do with cleaning up uh the gulf now this latest information is our top story today
[03:17:18.400 --> 03:17:22.960]  and i'll show folks a document cam shot of this if they're watching on prison planet dot tv
[03:17:22.960 --> 03:17:33.040]  oil industry insider and cfr member predicts gulf evacuation and it says buried an article on the
[03:17:33.040 --> 03:17:40.240]  gulf of mexico's scenario and predictions in the washington post quotes matthew simons founder
[03:17:40.240 --> 03:17:45.520]  and chairman emeritus of simons and company international in response to a tropical storm
[03:17:45.520 --> 03:17:51.440]  brewing in the caribbean simons says quote we're going to have to evacuate the gulf states
[03:17:51.440 --> 03:17:59.520]  can you imagine evacuating 20 million people this story is 80 times worse than i had thought
[03:18:01.200 --> 03:18:07.200]  and then it continues uh here in the article the national hurricane center i went on to say 40
[03:18:07.200 --> 03:18:11.840]  percent chance or a mid level chance that this will turn into a tropical storm this current storm
[03:18:11.840 --> 03:18:17.680]  will drive oil out of the gulf that's that's you know the the vast majority of it is still out in
[03:18:17.680 --> 03:18:24.080]  the ocean into land and it's a very toxic crude oil with record levels of all these toxic heavy
[03:18:24.080 --> 03:18:29.680]  metals and methane and benzene that is off-gassing you know about the medical workers getting sick
[03:18:29.680 --> 03:18:36.160]  people five miles in louisiana mississippi florida alabama getting sick the the the oil and tar hitting
[03:18:36.160 --> 03:18:42.000]  the beaches of the obama administration and bp blocking the coast guard blocking the states
[03:18:42.000 --> 03:18:47.360]  blocking everybody from cleaning it up that's back in the news today just blocking it everywhere
[03:18:47.360 --> 03:18:52.160]  to make it as bad as they can then all the evidence that this was an inside job it just goes from
[03:18:52.160 --> 03:18:55.760]  bad the worst but i remember a month ago seeing articles saying you know the troops are going
[03:18:55.760 --> 03:19:00.960]  to be deployed 40 million are going to be driven out and i said or troops had been deployed and
[03:19:00.960 --> 03:19:05.760]  it already begun so i called those towns and found out there wasn't evacuations going on
[03:19:05.760 --> 03:19:12.720]  but now a lot of times those are based on rumors that have a basis in fact now we're starting to see
[03:19:12.720 --> 03:19:18.560]  the epa say you know we may have to evacuate certain areas when this real oil comes in on
[03:19:18.560 --> 03:19:24.560]  shore and backs up in the rivers and estuaries and you've got the feds 10 miles into the estuaries
[03:19:24.560 --> 03:19:30.240]  in louisiana mississippi saying no fishing no boating uh so the the feds are really taken over
[03:19:30.240 --> 03:19:38.960]  and blocking any aid and if this toxic oil the some estimates are 50 million somewhere above
[03:19:38.960 --> 03:19:43.120]  100 million gallons does get blown in because the currents are just going to take it around
[03:19:43.120 --> 03:19:46.560]  florida and out the atlantic and that's a big problem and up the east coast but most of it
[03:19:46.560 --> 03:19:51.280]  stays out to sea just the leading edge hits land just a very small percentage but with
[03:19:51.280 --> 03:19:56.800]  hurricanes and tropical storms that blows the water in to the gulf into the gulf states i mean
[03:19:56.800 --> 03:20:04.320]  this could be a disaster of biblical reports so you think the mass of gulf oil leak won't affect
[03:20:04.320 --> 03:20:10.960]  the air you breathe think again benzene a toxic gas emitted from crude oil and a known carcinogen
[03:20:10.960 --> 03:20:16.080]  is now airborne traveling hundreds even thousands of miles inland whether you lived in the gulf or
[03:20:16.080 --> 03:20:20.880]  not benzene and other volatile organic compounds could cause adverse reactions to those living

[03:24:41.840 --> 03:24:45.520]  structure and then it's handed off to the politicians as hillary clinton has admitted in
[03:24:45.520 --> 03:24:50.880]  speeches she says i love coming to the cfr so you can tell me what to do and she was serious
[03:24:50.880 --> 03:24:56.480]  that was just a few months ago and so when you got a cfr member in the big cia publication
[03:24:57.200 --> 03:25:07.520]  washington post promoting the idea of 20 million being forced to evacuate out of florida
[03:25:07.520 --> 03:25:12.560]  texas louisiana mexico because yeah the oil spill hasn't hit texas because it happened off the
[03:25:12.560 --> 03:25:20.480]  coast of louisiana and the currents are taking it east and then southeast and then north up the east
[03:25:20.480 --> 03:25:25.680]  coast that's the trek that's the track that's what they predicted 60 plus days ago when it first
[03:25:25.680 --> 03:25:30.000]  happened on april 20th and that is indeed where the currents have gone but once the
[03:25:30.000 --> 03:25:38.320]  the tropical storm started and then the hurricanes the hurricanes do a south to north track and they
[03:25:38.320 --> 03:25:44.240]  vary to the west or the east but it's always north and so it's going to push that oil into texas
[03:25:44.240 --> 03:25:51.120]  uh mexico i mean cuba just in all different directions uh really stirring it up and it's
[03:25:51.120 --> 03:25:55.760]  so toxic and there's it's so much of it you know they first lied about it and said it was a few
[03:25:55.760 --> 03:26:00.960]  million barrels and you know now they're saying it's even more uh they're talking about it being
[03:26:00.960 --> 03:26:07.520]  50 million gallons 100 million gallons 150 million gallons no one knows but you can see it in the
[03:26:07.520 --> 03:26:14.160]  nasa satellites all over the gulf now and now starting to go out into the wider uh atlantic
[03:26:14.160 --> 03:26:21.840]  ocean the central atlantic so you have the washington post promoting the idea now is a trial
[03:26:21.840 --> 03:26:29.840]  balloon of marshal law of mass evacuation uh you have the epa coming out a week and a half ago
[03:26:29.840 --> 03:26:38.400]  saying we may have to evacuate certain gulf areas uh you now have bp though telling their employees
[03:26:38.400 --> 03:26:42.800]  and their contractors don't wear masks so that they can then deny that there's any toxic
[03:26:42.800 --> 03:26:52.160]  off gassing going on uh but uh god only knows ladies and gentlemen this could break the country
[03:26:52.160 --> 03:26:58.000]  if they overreact and do make 20 30 40 million people evacuate and then send in
[03:26:58.560 --> 03:27:03.600]  haliburton and all these corrupt companies to supposedly clean up the oil and if haliburton
[03:27:03.600 --> 03:27:09.040]  and no bid contracts was caught car charging 15 million dollars for a 400 dollar blue tarp
[03:27:09.040 --> 03:27:15.280]  tarp no that's 15 million for a 400 dollar tarp i mean maybe they could charge another 500 to put
[03:27:15.280 --> 03:27:22.160]  the tarp up okay a thousand 900 bucks something like that no 15 million for a tarp uh can you
[03:27:22.160 --> 03:27:26.720]  imagine what it'll cost to have haliburton and others clean this up see that's why they won't
[03:27:26.720 --> 03:27:31.600]  let citizens do it is why they won't the states do it this is a federal mess with bp they're
[03:27:31.600 --> 03:27:36.480]  going to give you a carbon tax to pay for the cleanup uh and they're going to let their buddies
[03:27:36.480 --> 03:27:40.960]  like haliburton and others clean it up and you the stinking slaves aren't going to do it you're not
[03:27:40.960 --> 03:27:45.280]  allowed to have a gun to protect yourself in your home professionals do that though they have no
[03:27:45.280 --> 03:27:49.520]  liability to actually protect you you're not allowed to have your own farm now under federal
[03:27:49.520 --> 03:27:53.600]  regulations they're trying to shut down farms and ranches under animal ID premise society
[03:27:53.600 --> 03:27:57.680]  making it harder and harder openly in australia under carbon tax over half the country's now
[03:27:57.680 --> 03:28:02.400]  off limits to farming that was already under farming they just said no farming period not carbon
[03:28:02.400 --> 03:28:09.920]  tax is just no farming period that's national australian news the people throw out run over it
[03:28:09.920 --> 03:28:16.960]  they put a new lady in who pledges she's going to do it so all of this is happening and the cfr
[03:28:16.960 --> 03:28:23.440]  could be hyping this just a fearmonger and they could use it as a pretext for martial law in the
[03:28:23.440 --> 03:28:29.760]  gulf they could also just be testing right now to see if they'll get away with it uh or they really
[03:28:29.760 --> 03:28:35.120]  could know that these hundreds of millions of gallons of oil are going to be coming in
[03:28:35.120 --> 03:28:40.480]  and that it is toxic which it is toxic to some extent uh and that it is going to cause a major
[03:28:40.480 --> 03:28:47.600]  respiratory uh crisis and also a fire hazard uh and that i mean if they'll evacuate half of a major
[03:28:47.600 --> 03:28:52.480]  town because somebody was seen walking by their car with a gun you know they're trying to be these
[03:28:52.480 --> 03:28:57.520]  ninnies that go into fetal positions duck and cover whenever the government tells us well then
[03:28:57.520 --> 03:29:02.720]  if that's the case the sky's the limit they may try to use this to declare an emergency obama may
[03:29:03.440 --> 03:29:08.880]  try to nationalize the oil companies uh but when you hear nationalize that means the mega
[03:29:08.880 --> 03:29:14.480]  oil companies will use this to shut down their competition it's government that gives the oligopoly
[03:29:14.480 --> 03:29:19.760]  to bp in alaska for 80 percent or more of the oil coming out of there and most of it going to china
[03:29:19.760 --> 03:29:24.720]  it's the government that only allows certain corporations to drill in the gulf uh so so
[03:29:24.720 --> 03:29:29.200]  competition is a sin according to the founder the Rockefeller clan they use government to
[03:29:29.200 --> 03:29:33.040]  shut down their competition so we're going to be watching this very very closely but uh
[03:29:33.760 --> 03:29:37.520]  you know i had said a month ago this looked like fear mongering but i wasn't sure i didn't
[03:29:37.520 --> 03:29:41.840]  criticize those that were saying this was going to happen i just said it looks a little extreme
[03:29:41.840 --> 03:29:45.840]  more and more though it's being pushed in the mainstream media as something that's going to
[03:29:45.840 --> 03:29:52.960]  happen and so the question is is it real or is it a hoax we'll be covering it here we're on the march
[03:29:52.960 --> 03:29:58.240]  the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[03:30:00.800 --> 03:30:06.880]  the question is where should the american people draw their line in the sand what have we got a
[03:30:06.880 --> 03:30:12.880]  republic or a monarchy a republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights
[03:30:12.880 --> 03:30:18.000]  not democracy not mob rule two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner so they think they own
[03:30:18.000 --> 03:30:24.720]  our land they think they're on our water children our education our money we have to define who we
[03:30:24.720 --> 03:30:30.480]  are and what we will tolerate somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the patriot uprising
[03:30:31.760 --> 03:30:35.440]  we have the facts we have the constitution we have the bill of rights we have common

[03:33:47.760 --> 03:33:54.560]  a secret law lets police arrest for failing to show id near summit now remember when the feds
[03:33:54.560 --> 03:33:59.040]  hired provocateurs they kicked this off globally in 99 we have the footage in my film police state
[03:33:59.040 --> 03:34:04.640]  to the takeover police admitting it they hired thugs to attack police the delta force ran the
[03:34:04.640 --> 03:34:08.720]  operation that was in the seattle post intelligence sir and the seattle times this was admitted
[03:34:10.080 --> 03:34:17.360]  to then clamp the city down and say no anti-wto stickers allowed on cars on lapels
[03:34:17.360 --> 03:34:23.840]  we have police saying not in our city now secret emergency decree this is government testing and
[03:34:23.840 --> 03:34:30.800]  getting everybody used to it well we had martial law at pittsburgh g20 we have had police dogs by
[03:34:30.800 --> 03:34:34.960]  old women coming out of grocery stores because there was no one allowed on the streets day or
[03:34:34.960 --> 03:34:40.000]  night selectively yeah we went out and found college kids at the park playing frisbee golf and
[03:34:40.000 --> 03:34:45.440]  attacked them on video because we said no one allowed outside no congregations no one
[03:34:45.440 --> 03:34:50.880]  where the government and when the g20 arrives that's your real government it's illegitimate
[03:34:50.880 --> 03:34:57.200]  as a three dollar bill but that's who runs things and the toronto star reports the cbc reports it
[03:34:57.200 --> 03:35:04.240]  was one billion now it's 1.2 and another paper says they're now estimating today 1.5 billion but
[03:35:04.240 --> 03:35:10.960]  at least 1.2 has already been spent on security for 20 delegates of the g20 and eight delegates of
[03:35:10.960 --> 03:35:17.040]  the g8 because the people are the enemy and plus you get to run up a bigger bill and most of the
[03:35:17.040 --> 03:35:22.400]  big banks own the private security firms and they admit when we showed us army and us army
[03:35:22.400 --> 03:35:28.640]  fatigues in a champagne police car at the g20 you've all seen that footage when when when we
[03:35:28.640 --> 03:35:35.440]  played that video and the drugs report linked to it we got a call here by g20 private security
[03:35:35.440 --> 03:35:40.320]  saying those are our officers in police and military uniforms and we did take them to a
[03:35:40.320 --> 03:35:44.640]  secret facility but it's not the military stop blaming them and then they put a press release
[03:35:44.640 --> 03:35:51.280]  out as if that was better oh we have secret goons in in in military national guard uniforms
[03:35:51.280 --> 03:35:59.280]  grabbing peaceful activists and shoving them into cars and it turned out that was a scyop it was
[03:35:59.280 --> 03:36:04.960]  all fake to scare people watching television to never come to events oh you come you get rubber
[03:36:04.960 --> 03:36:11.600]  bulleted you get attacked secret law let's police arrest for failing to show id near summit and they
[03:36:11.600 --> 03:36:16.480]  covered charlie veitch a man arrested in downtown toronto for failing to show police his id and that
[03:36:16.480 --> 03:36:22.160]  video is up on info wars in prison planet we make pull that up uh head of love police it's also on
[03:36:22.160 --> 03:36:27.040]  the love police website uh founder of love police arrested for not showing id but here it is in the
[03:36:27.040 --> 03:36:32.560]  news very polite very nice to the police and he said no i don't feel like i need to talk to you i'm
[03:36:32.560 --> 03:36:37.520]  here on the city street and and they said okay we're taking you to jail also when luke radowski
[03:36:37.520 --> 03:36:42.000]  tried to drive across uh at the beautiful nagra falls man that youtube video he's shouting see
[03:36:42.000 --> 03:36:47.280]  nagra in the background it's beautiful and he and his other cohorts uh they were not allowed to get
[03:36:47.280 --> 03:36:53.360]  in matt lapasic and others that a foy line whether uh of who i don't know i've never met her but but
[03:36:53.360 --> 03:37:02.240]  they're all there they're peacefully trying to go across and once they get there uh to to the
[03:37:02.240 --> 03:37:06.080]  border they say you're with we are changed no you're basically terrorist you can't come in and
[03:37:06.080 --> 03:37:10.480]  then homeland security interrogated them on the way back and so that's now happening with these
[03:37:10.480 --> 03:37:16.240]  international databases uh let's go to charlie veitch who's made international headlines by exposing
[03:37:16.240 --> 03:37:22.400]  the secret law you the slaves can't know i wonder what other secret laws there are i mean kind of
[03:37:22.400 --> 03:37:28.320]  like the directives where they take our blood in canada the u.s england uh in europe proper without
[03:37:28.320 --> 03:37:32.560]  telling us and now they admit they take our babies blood for 38 years secretly or maybe how they have
[03:37:32.560 --> 03:37:36.720]  secret directives to kill us and take our organs when they want them that have now come out uh go
[03:37:36.720 --> 03:37:40.880]  ahead and uh and of course that's now admitted that have been denied that israel and coalition
[03:37:40.880 --> 03:37:44.880]  forces and others were killing people and taking their organs is now admitted uh but but uh mr
[03:37:44.880 --> 03:37:48.640]  veitch maybe there's other secret laws we don't know about isn't that the bedrock of freedom to
[03:37:48.640 --> 03:37:55.280]  have secret laws yeah alex i've just come out of the court about two hours ago where i was tried
[03:37:55.280 --> 03:38:02.960]  for the the new law i have it here in my official form is the public works protection act section
[03:38:02.960 --> 03:38:07.840]  five one and it came into effect that's so my lawyer said the pre-lawyer appointed to me on
[03:38:07.840 --> 03:38:14.320]  june the second this year especially for the g20 and it also extends to private security officers
[03:38:14.320 --> 03:38:20.240]  if you're in an area covered by the public works act private security can now have you arrested if
[03:38:20.240 --> 03:38:25.280]  you don't give your details over to them this is a global strategy just like we saw at the g20 in
[03:38:25.280 --> 03:38:31.440]  pittsburgh no absolutely and uh i just want to say as well i've been dealing with police in america
[03:38:31.440 --> 03:38:39.680]  in holland in germany in the uk and i've never felt such vicious fascist bogus scumbag behavior
[03:38:39.680 --> 03:38:46.080]  as the g20 what have you heard me say for years i mean canada they got me for 15 hours and literally

[03:39:03.040 --> 03:39:07.840]  to attack police so they can beat the hell out of canadiens i mean canadiens have an evil government
[03:39:07.840 --> 03:39:13.600]  and they need to wake up to it no absolutely alex the the guy who arrested me had a little mustache

[03:41:41.280 --> 03:41:46.640]  and and then and then laugh at all of them at the g20 and they said it was military with cops just
[03:41:46.640 --> 03:41:51.120]  like going you filth and they would just pull their pants down and and not that anybody had
[03:41:51.120 --> 03:41:56.800]  anything to be ashamed of but they would just ha ha ha ha we've got this country down it's ours

[03:42:04.000 --> 03:42:08.960]  go ahead no i had this massive hanger alex what really upset me the most was in toronto they have
[03:42:08.960 --> 03:42:13.680]  the normal police but they also have the court sir court service police and they were about 20
[03:42:13.680 --> 03:42:19.520]  to 40 years old and they were walking past my cage rattling the bar saying ha ha are you going to
[03:42:19.520 --> 03:42:24.000]  fight the man now are you having fun in your cage now big boy who's the big uh who's the big
[03:42:24.000 --> 03:42:29.280]  protester now they were really enjoying humiliating me and every three or four hours they want the
[03:42:29.280 --> 03:42:33.840]  women they want the farms they want the ranches they want it all and they're going to get it and
[03:42:33.840 --> 03:42:38.080]  their bosses are they're injecting them with steroids and giving them speed pills and yeah show
[03:42:38.080 --> 03:42:45.680]  that rabble scum you own them in the cops are ah it's like pirates let's get them boys ha ha
[03:42:45.680 --> 03:42:51.280]  meanwhile the mexican troops shoot at them they urinate on themselves and run you know i would
[03:42:51.280 --> 03:42:56.480]  have a lady to pull over and beat up i'm sorry listen charlie veitch and you know i talk about
[03:42:56.480 --> 03:43:01.520]  tyranny the stress of it makes me you know uh get a little nonsensical here but but but recapping
[03:43:01.520 --> 03:43:07.840]  these mega cages these orwellian guantanamo grids uh describe this for us and run through what they
[03:43:07.840 --> 03:43:13.360]  did to you again yeah well you you enter in the back of a van through this big aircraft hangar
[03:43:13.360 --> 03:43:19.120]  entry point and you get taken into this side big holding cage where they do the initial strip search
[03:43:19.120 --> 03:43:23.280]  and then you go into this room where they've got these like uh porta cabin things with like
[03:43:23.280 --> 03:43:27.920]  every single room has a brand new cctv camera and a microphone so and then the officer says
[03:43:27.920 --> 03:43:32.640]  i need to read you out this sign so you're now under video and audio surveillance and then i got
[03:43:32.640 --> 03:43:37.680]  then strip searched again taken to my holding excuse me they strip search you in front of video
[03:43:38.640 --> 03:43:43.200]  uh no that was in private the strip searching okay yeah but then i got the only strip search
[03:43:43.200 --> 03:43:47.760]  you and record at the airport i'm sorry go ahead that's right so then i got taken into the massive
[03:43:47.760 --> 03:43:52.480]  cage uh next to the other people and that's when they walk past and kept up the humiliation for
[03:43:52.480 --> 03:43:57.200]  as long as possible and it was extremely cold they had extremely powerful air conditioning units there
[03:43:57.200 --> 03:44:01.920]  i was wearing shorts and sandals they refused to give me blankets for five hours they refused to
[03:44:01.920 --> 03:44:08.160]  give me water yeah that's the israelis pioneered uh that modern chinese model of a deprivation
[03:44:08.160 --> 03:44:14.400]  with the cold please continue yeah and i actually got to the point when i started screaming at the
[03:44:14.400 --> 03:44:19.360]  top of my lungs i'm a human being and you're keeping me in a cage i need to be let out of here
[03:44:19.360 --> 03:44:24.960]  and only then when i really started rattling the bars did i get given a pool over jumper thing
[03:44:24.960 --> 03:44:29.440]  but then it was um this then the future they'll just take you shooed you in the head and got
[03:44:29.440 --> 03:44:35.200]  you and sell the organs and give the cops some money i'm not kidding that's the i really did
[03:44:35.200 --> 03:44:40.560]  feel that this was military police preparation for a future lockdown now they want your they
[03:44:40.560 --> 03:44:46.560]  want your organs i'm sorry go ahead i just couldn't believe the facility i was taken into it was
[03:44:46.560 --> 03:44:51.440]  like something out of the x-files or something from a apocalypse describe it for us describe it for us
[03:44:52.080 --> 03:44:56.000]  it was probably about the site it was in a the toronto film studios i don't know where
[03:44:56.000 --> 03:45:01.280]  about in town that is but it's about the size of two american football pitches with the stadium so
[03:45:01.280 --> 03:45:08.000]  immense size and just endless rows of strip lights and cctv cameras above every single cage and then
[03:45:08.000 --> 03:45:13.600]  the cages are like a full you know the cage goes across the top and there's microphones pointing
[03:45:13.600 --> 03:45:19.360]  down into every cell they have a little uh toilet in the corner with cameras pointing at that as well
[03:45:19.360 --> 03:45:23.840]  and then there's people walking past humiliating you the every five minutes so you don't really get
[03:45:23.840 --> 03:45:30.080]  a chance to do anything well i mean the message is don't protest drink the fluoride water i mean
[03:45:30.080 --> 03:45:35.840]  it's like humongous and road warrior just give us the gas we spare your lives that's all we want
[03:45:35.840 --> 03:45:44.480]  just walk away just walk away and i'm gonna hold on the humongous is here to be magnanimous we
[03:45:44.480 --> 03:45:49.360]  understand what you want but you you're not going to get away from here i mean i mean that's it it's
[03:45:49.360 --> 03:45:54.160]  it's don't protest just let the banks rob everything just let us run everything or we're
[03:45:54.160 --> 03:45:58.800]  going to swat team you we're gonna we're gonna put you in prisons we're gonna hire provocateurs
[03:45:58.800 --> 03:46:03.840]  so we can attack you as the royal mounted police have been caught i mean this is the end this is
[03:46:03.840 --> 03:46:09.520]  simultaneously every country they meet in the g20 bankers use it as a model for the special
[03:46:09.520 --> 03:46:15.920]  security event law enforcement threat fusion center grid takeover this is a red alert continue
[03:46:16.720 --> 03:46:23.280]  yeah the absolute reason they chose toronto to host the g20 in is because they know they can transport
[03:46:23.280 --> 03:46:28.480]  and big buses thousands of people to these holding cells these cages on the outskirts of town
[03:46:28.480 --> 03:46:33.760]  and process them and strip search them and i almost reached breaking point alex i almost snapped
[03:46:33.760 --> 03:46:39.200]  psychologically because it really is a utterly nightmarish and then they'll have you on video
[03:46:39.200 --> 03:46:43.520]  and then they get to come in and beat you with billy clubs and restrain you and then oh he died
[03:46:44.080 --> 03:46:51.040]  oh you know the status guitar i work for the bankers we're overturning all the republics
[03:46:51.040 --> 03:46:58.400]  all the freedom i'm sorry go ahead alex i wish you were joking but they seriously enjoyed
[03:46:58.400 --> 03:47:03.760]  the power over me and when i was there psychologically breaking down saying i'm a human being please
[03:47:03.760 --> 03:47:10.720]  let me out all i could hear was laughter now i've heard it i just lost his audio are you there
[03:47:11.360 --> 03:47:16.400]  yeah i'm here can you hear me yeah you're back uh charlie uh no i've been there in canada but i
[03:47:16.400 --> 03:47:21.200]  didn't have it as bad as you and i was very polite and these guys were like sadists i mean their faces
[03:47:21.200 --> 03:47:27.600]  were and then i'd be sitting there to the guys when they let me out on one of the cells being
[03:47:27.600 --> 03:47:31.280]  interior i'd say i guess we're gonna be here for a long time i have to go back to the us
[03:47:32.160 --> 03:47:36.160]  and one of them almost jumped the counter he said you're trying to escape i heard you
[03:47:36.800 --> 03:47:42.080]  and then and then he'd smile like i'm setting you up of course i'm evil you don't understand
[03:47:42.080 --> 03:47:46.240]  it's time for us criminals to rule you don't understand how many of us there are now we've
[03:47:46.240 --> 03:47:52.880]  gotten into every position it's almost time scum i'm sorry finish your story alex i really do wish
[03:47:52.880 --> 03:47:57.520]  you were joking but you're not it is absolutely correct everything you've just said it is a repeat
[03:47:57.520 --> 03:48:02.800]  of nazi germany except now they have a million times more powerful technology to treat us all
[03:48:02.800 --> 03:48:08.560]  like sheep i experienced it for the best part of 24 hours first hand and it's really really
[03:48:08.560 --> 03:48:13.280]  congress is told they won't say where the trillions are i mean what do people think's going on here
[03:48:13.280 --> 03:48:17.280]  this is real they're openly saying they're going to shut the web down they're openly saying they're
[03:48:17.280 --> 03:48:22.320]  going to secretly arrest us folks i'm not joking around with people either as charlie veish now
[03:48:22.320 --> 03:48:27.120]  now the video some of the video was on the web you being arrested you were very polite to their
[03:48:27.120 --> 03:48:32.720]  to their little lordships yeah to the little adult hitler with his little adult hitler moustache
[03:48:32.720 --> 03:48:37.360]  he actually told me you're 30 seconds away from getting yourself arrested boy so i said hold on a
[03:48:37.360 --> 03:48:41.440]  second hold on a second can i just reason with you like a human being and then he handcuffed me
[03:48:41.440 --> 03:48:46.720]  now they don't talk to suboid you're a blood bag you're to supply blood to the state blood bags
[03:48:46.720 --> 03:48:53.440]  don't talk they get in their matrix tube and they supply energy shut up blood bag yeah you think

[03:49:18.400 --> 03:49:22.720]  they want is when they try to round people up they'll call us violent anybody that doesn't say
[03:49:22.720 --> 03:49:28.080]  oh sure mr hitler take my children too and then they'll get to run around and show funerals of
[03:49:28.080 --> 03:49:34.240]  people and then cry and whine oh the little nazi outfits oh they they're being me to us
[03:49:34.240 --> 03:49:38.880]  golden sacks is good uh but in england and canada where they're pretty much disarmed you guys do
[03:49:38.880 --> 03:49:44.560]  have a big a bigger problem we have a massive problem and right now in the uk criminals and
[03:49:44.560 --> 03:49:49.200]  bad people have as much access to weapons as they want and law-abiding citizens who might
[03:49:49.200 --> 03:49:54.720]  want to defend themselves against for example a fascist government takeover are unable to do so
[03:49:54.720 --> 03:49:59.760]  we are like lambs to the slaughter and it's a very well this is no doubt this is real and and uh

[03:55:49.840 --> 03:55:56.720]  a barrier is almost impregnable how could this cost 1.2 billion or basically the budget of the
[03:55:56.720 --> 03:56:03.600]  entire city every year yes they are giving everyone any service that they want to they're
[03:56:03.600 --> 03:56:09.200]  providing free food for us they're doing a tremendous job as being a good host and also
[03:56:09.200 --> 03:56:16.800]  well the organization you're meeting with or the city of toronto uh the the uh the organization

[03:56:29.760 --> 03:56:35.200]  you're loving and helpful uh know what i'm saying is that the job that they're doing in promoting
[03:56:35.200 --> 03:56:40.640]  this is excellent from that viewpoint oh so there's a lot of public relations going on so they're
[03:56:40.640 --> 03:56:47.680]  spreading a lot of cash around to the slaves we talk about a selling job they are doing an excellent
[03:56:47.680 --> 03:56:53.520]  selling job and i think kurt lewin would would find this a marvelous uh group exercise in group
[03:56:53.520 --> 03:56:59.280]  management and group control and group thing and so that's why that's why they don't allow any
[03:56:59.280 --> 03:57:05.840]  protest or anybody because it can only be the message of our loving bankers yes they they are
[03:57:05.840 --> 03:57:13.040]  so well organized here the police and so forth and the promoters of this particular uh summit uh
