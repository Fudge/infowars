[00:00.000 --> 00:12.100]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.100 --> 00:20.880]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.880 --> 00:28.440]  all right we've got an amazing guest coming up actually two amazing guests
[00:28.440 --> 00:33.880]  coming up joining us via video skype in the next segment Oklahoma City
[00:33.880 --> 00:38.560]  investigators one of them that was there when the bombing you know in the
[00:38.560 --> 00:43.400]  aftermath that is coming up in the next segment also in some of the other news
[00:43.400 --> 00:48.560]  Obama prepared to attack military action again Obama prepared to take military
[00:48.560 --> 00:55.200]  action against Iran Dennis Ross a big Obama advisor says if Obama draws the
[00:55.200 --> 01:00.040]  conclusion that certain kind of steps should be taken against Iran he'll take
[01:00.040 --> 01:04.560]  them yeah because he's completely blackmailed and controlled here's
[01:04.560 --> 01:11.720]  another one dozens of people die in roadside bombs in Iraq right as the
[01:11.720 --> 01:15.300]  United States begins to officially pull out it has all those advisors and
[01:15.300 --> 01:20.800]  embassy staff and mercenaries there and Tony Cartolucci writer for info wars
[01:20.800 --> 01:29.240]  calm has a big article out in a move that almost defies belief it is so
[01:29.240 --> 01:33.400]  brazen and hypocritical many will not believe it no matter how many State
[01:33.400 --> 01:37.640]  Department officials confirm it the US has been guarding a terrorist training
[01:37.640 --> 01:43.760]  camp inside Iraq with US troops and is planning to relocate them possibly in a
[01:43.760 --> 01:49.320]  freshly abandoned US military base in Iraq while DC lobbyists work feverishly
[01:49.320 --> 01:57.560]  to have them delisted armed and sent to conduct terrorist operations in Iran and
[01:57.560 --> 02:01.520]  this is what two three weeks ago Steve Pachennick former State Department
[02:01.520 --> 02:07.200]  official and terrorism expert talked about the MEK which is an admitted real
[02:07.200 --> 02:10.960]  terrorist group is basically working for the US government I mean what group
[02:10.960 --> 02:14.840]  isn't because this isn't the US government ladies and gentlemen it's
[02:14.840 --> 02:19.480]  offshore mega banks that are totally ruthless and hire criminal mercenary
[02:19.480 --> 02:23.240]  groups the stage terror attacks all over the world to finance other terror
[02:23.240 --> 02:29.240]  groups the stage bombings here in the US to do it all so the system can take our
[02:29.240 --> 02:34.960]  liberties and freedoms and pose as our saviors and it is so incredibly
[02:34.960 --> 02:41.080]  dangerous on that front looking at Korea and China ex-president Carter sends
[02:41.080 --> 02:48.680]  condolences to Kim Jong-un and that only props these these these these crazy
[02:48.680 --> 02:52.920]  hereditary dictators up I understand they've got to have somebody who can
[02:52.920 --> 02:58.320]  diplomatically talk to these people but why did Donald Rumsfeld as the head of
[02:58.320 --> 03:02.720]  the big Swiss company back in the mid-1990s transfer of the reactor systems
[03:02.720 --> 03:08.760]  so North Korea could have nuclear weapons continuing Finland finds
[03:08.760 --> 03:13.880]  Patriot missiles on China-bound ship mark this fireworks see while you're busy
[03:13.880 --> 03:17.920]  being told to be scared to death of al-qaeda under the table ten thousand
[03:17.920 --> 03:23.840]  plus missiles two thousand plus that are high-tech surface-to-air missiles were
[03:23.840 --> 03:27.360]  basically given to al-qaeda and allowed to keep them when al-qaeda was given
[03:27.360 --> 03:31.720]  control of Libya by NATO and that's on record that's even mainstream news pull
[03:31.720 --> 03:36.360]  it up pull a blunt and telegraph headlines like al-qaeda flag now flies
[03:36.360 --> 03:41.000]  over Libya al-qaeda being sent in to fight Syrians al-qaeda works for the
[03:41.000 --> 03:44.920]  globalist that have hijacked this country people are like but why would they
[03:44.920 --> 03:49.080]  have them attack us so they can take all our liberties blame Iraq that had
[03:49.080 --> 03:53.080]  nothing to do with it and invade them now they're blaming Iran for 9-11
[03:53.080 --> 03:59.360]  next they'll blame you or maybe Santa Claus for it everybody but who's
[03:59.360 --> 04:05.440]  involved the Finnish authorities have impounded an isle of man flag ship bound
[04:05.440 --> 04:08.720]  for China with undeclared missiles and explosives
[04:08.720 --> 04:13.000]  British or US government they're always doing this police are questioning the
[04:13.000 --> 04:19.440]  crew of the MS Thor Liberty after what were described as 69 patriot anti-missile
[04:19.440 --> 04:23.640]  missiles were found on board yeah you can also use a patriot to shoot air
[04:23.640 --> 04:27.840]  aircraft down all day long oh but they've been saying al-qaeda must have
[04:27.840 --> 04:33.240]  stingers left over from the 80s give all your rights up continuing here
[04:33.240 --> 04:39.400]  Interior Minister Pavi Rassen said the missiles were marked fireworks the MS
[04:39.400 --> 04:43.160]  Thor Liberty was docked and finished port after leaving Germany last week
[04:43.160 --> 04:48.640]  dock workers became suspicious after mr. Napolitano told him to be I'm joking
[04:48.640 --> 04:53.880]  after finding explosives poorly stored on open pallets and missiles were then
[04:53.880 --> 04:58.000]  found in containers marked fireworks more on this coming up at first our

[06:14.440 --> 06:19.160]  members influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the
[06:19.160 --> 06:24.280]  Sharks I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay

[08:00.560 --> 08:14.680]  ease the T-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network all right
[08:14.680 --> 08:19.480]  we are continuing our series of interviews to document what really
[08:19.480 --> 08:23.800]  happened Oklahoma City on the record this week and I'll do it next week and
[08:23.800 --> 08:28.440]  into the new year at least once or twice a week because there's so many amazing
[08:28.440 --> 08:33.120]  people that are interviewed and then some that aren't in this film a noble
[08:33.120 --> 08:38.680]  lie Oklahoma City 1995 Jane Graham the head of HUD who was in the building and
[08:38.680 --> 08:42.960]  saw known feds planting bombs she'd know what they were at the time big gray
[08:42.960 --> 08:46.880]  sticks of butter they said they were with the telephone company you've got the
[08:46.880 --> 08:50.120]  inventor of the neutron bombs saying clearly that there were explosives inside
[08:50.120 --> 08:53.640]  the building the newscast admitting it as well you've got the former head of
[08:53.640 --> 08:57.560]  Air Force weapons development breaking it down the mother of police officer of
[08:57.560 --> 09:00.920]  the year Terrence Yankee the first to respond to saw the feds running around
[09:00.920 --> 09:05.760]  involved they of course killed him it's an amazing film and you need to show it
[09:05.760 --> 09:10.560]  to police and military especially because the Obama administration has put
[09:10.560 --> 09:14.520]  out what three different memos saying a new Oklahoma City would really help
[09:14.520 --> 09:18.400]  them they don't even veil it they don't say we're gonna do it they just say it
[09:18.400 --> 09:21.640]  would really help us and if there's a new one we're gonna blame the right wing
[09:21.640 --> 09:26.200]  and barring that we're in deep trouble and I see all of it moving towards that
[09:26.200 --> 09:31.040]  now our exposure of it may stop them and I've been talking a lot more in the
[09:31.040 --> 09:34.800]  last year about Oklahoma City again as you know I mean I made a 40 minute film
[09:34.800 --> 09:38.600]  within a film and I made a lot of films are like three hours long like road to
[09:38.600 --> 09:41.600]  tyranny that's really three different subjects the history of terror in the
[09:41.600 --> 09:46.120]  New World Order stage terror then Oklahoma City the first World Trade Center
[09:46.120 --> 09:52.200]  and then into 9-11 now this video is available at info wars.com and it
[09:52.200 --> 09:55.360]  supports the filmmakers and of course my operation when you get it but but
[09:55.360 --> 10:00.560]  bottom line get it air on access TV have local showings in your area just like
[10:00.560 --> 10:04.440]  mode my films get my films your authorize make copies of my films I want
[10:04.440 --> 10:09.200]  all of my videos out there to everybody because this is a life and death situation
[10:09.200 --> 10:13.080]  I mean you watch my police state films you'll understand what's now unfolding
[10:13.080 --> 10:19.320]  now let's stop right there Don Browning is a retired Oklahoma City police
[10:19.320 --> 10:24.000]  officer former US Marine and Vietnam veteran Don worked in the canine unit
[10:24.000 --> 10:28.280]  and was part of the search and rescue team at the Murrah building after the
[10:28.280 --> 10:32.240]  bombing and we're gonna go to some important questions and riding shotgun
[10:32.240 --> 10:37.760]  with him is Holland Vanden Neuenhof he is a native of Oklahoma and served as a
[10:37.760 --> 10:41.720]  rifle squad leader in Marine Corps Holland decided to get off the bench one
[10:41.720 --> 10:44.920]  day and started riding and passing out leaflets that expose government
[10:44.920 --> 10:48.960]  corruption and cover-ups these efforts led him to collaborate with the Oklahoma
[10:48.960 --> 10:53.200]  bombing investigation committee in their efforts to uncover the truth behind
[10:53.200 --> 10:57.240]  the okc bombing he was instrumental in the formation of the first low-power FM
[10:57.240 --> 11:01.440]  station in Oklahoma to fight the globalist I had that part that focused on
[11:01.440 --> 11:04.840]  truth and freedom issues carrying my show of course Holland engages in a
[11:04.840 --> 11:08.840]  variety of endeavors to spread awareness in his community absolutely and fight
[11:08.840 --> 11:12.120]  the criminals that have taken this country over so both these gentlemen
[11:12.120 --> 11:16.800]  that join us a good American Patriots and Marines fighting the tyranny and for
[11:16.800 --> 11:19.040]  my memory Don I've never talked to you but I believe you're one of the guys
[11:19.040 --> 11:22.520]  got threatened to we've talked to the other guys some people off record
[11:22.520 --> 11:26.640]  the Department of Defense bomb disposal you name it where they said don't ask
[11:26.640 --> 11:30.560]  questions about the bombs or we know where your daughter goes to school just
[11:30.560 --> 11:35.000]  just incredible that Don Browning great to have you joining us via video Skype
[11:35.000 --> 11:40.000]  today and we we appreciate your courage coming on air thank you sir you know I
[11:40.000 --> 11:43.920]  could babble all day but why are you here what did you see what is most
[11:43.920 --> 11:47.760]  important for us to understand and Holland you can pretty much because you
[11:47.760 --> 11:52.240]  know him well and have studied Oklahoma even more than I have where do you think
[11:52.240 --> 11:57.200]  we should go first well we can start with the day of the bombing of course when
[11:57.200 --> 12:01.840]  Don responded and the get into the evacuations that were later denied that
[12:01.840 --> 12:06.480]  they took place then the explosives that were found inside the building Don you
[12:06.480 --> 12:09.080]  were the first to respond one of the first to respond to the bombing right
[12:09.080 --> 12:16.360]  yes sir and you and your dog Gunny right great and one of the main points of the
[12:16.360 --> 12:19.760]  movie what we try to emphasize is the fact that there were several evacuations
[12:19.760 --> 12:24.000]  after the initial bombing that they were later denied they said they were fall
[12:24.000 --> 12:30.160]  false alarms or hoaxes but in a noble lie we have videotape from a sheriff's
[12:30.160 --> 12:35.480]  deputy taking during one of the evacuations that shows the ATF pulling
[12:35.480 --> 12:41.080]  weapons and plastic explosives out of the building no one has seen this tape
[12:41.080 --> 12:45.880]  well some people had but it's been passed down hand-to-hand we digitally
[12:45.880 --> 12:50.160]  remastered the tape no one has seen in this quality and it's never seen widespread
[12:50.160 --> 12:53.800]  publicity yeah by the way that's the kind of stuff that's in this film is many
[12:53.800 --> 12:58.600]  of your team have been on this for over a decade I mean this is a obsession to
[12:58.600 --> 13:01.400]  you know to get the murder of these children out I mean this is that's why
[13:01.400 --> 13:04.600]  it's so important well this is my hometown I grew up in Oklahoma City and
[13:04.600 --> 13:08.560]  once I started realizing what had happened I felt it was my duty to expose
[13:08.560 --> 13:12.000]  the truth I saw that no one else I mean every other people were doing it but I
[13:12.000 --> 13:15.880]  wanted to really get the story out to the people and we found a team we got a
[13:15.880 --> 13:20.120]  good director's team production editing and we made the movie as the best way to
[13:20.120 --> 13:24.120]  get them the message out to the out to the masses exactly you know we're well
[13:24.120 --> 13:27.600]  done testament in modern times so let's get into why Don is such an
[13:27.600 --> 13:34.320]  incredible witness and such an amazing expert well Don you were actually in
[13:34.320 --> 13:38.280]  the building with the in the canine rescue units and during one of the
[13:38.280 --> 13:44.280]  evacuations what were they doing during evacuations as far as the initial
[13:44.280 --> 13:48.240]  evacuation we're just trying to determine location of the victims really
[13:48.240 --> 13:57.240]  trying to determine how to remove some of the debris at about 11 30 10 30 11
[13:57.240 --> 14:03.680]  o'clock that first morning we were halted for the first time ordered out of
[14:03.680 --> 14:12.680]  the building for no other reason and then they wanted to secure the building on a
[14:12.680 --> 14:18.040]  limited access we were allowed back in in fact work for a little bit in the area
[14:18.040 --> 14:24.480]  with Dana Bradley who's had her leg amputated being pinned in the
[14:24.480 --> 14:29.080]  building worked in that area for a next little bit and then finally we were
[14:29.080 --> 14:35.080]  ordered out by us marshals and we were sequestered pretty much on the south
[14:35.080 --> 14:40.080]  side of the Murra building in the courtyard area was kind of held at
[14:40.080 --> 14:43.520]  bay told that we'd be allowed to go back in and search but there were files that
[14:43.520 --> 14:46.440]  were so critical to the government that until those files were found there
[14:46.440 --> 14:51.320]  would be no more rescue or recovery and there were people still inside yes sir
[14:51.320 --> 14:56.120]  yes sir there was a gentleman that was apparently it was already deceased but
[14:56.120 --> 15:01.720]  he was still laying bleeding out on the south base of the building and you could
[15:01.720 --> 15:04.840]  see that and they wouldn't let you recover yes sir and because they had to
[15:04.840 --> 15:10.080]  recover documents correct what's important about that Alex is that that
[15:10.080 --> 15:14.000]  maybe maybe one of the reasons that this happened is that they would their
[15:14.000 --> 15:17.880]  priority was on the documents for some reason recovering those documents to the
[15:17.880 --> 15:21.960]  detriment of the people who are trapped inside and died as a Dilkham city police
[15:21.960 --> 15:26.240]  chief said on camera that we'd lost people because of the evacuations we'd
[15:26.240 --> 15:30.160]  lost people because of this picture and we have all the newscasts where the
[15:30.160 --> 15:33.280]  governor's yeah they found more bombs there they're taking them out that's
[15:33.280 --> 15:38.120]  another device the bomb squad has and here's Don Browning who was there you
[15:38.120 --> 15:44.080]  know with the dog and was a police officer and also a marine veteran so
[15:44.080 --> 15:48.520]  we I mean just amazing to see what was going on we only have those newscasts
[15:48.520 --> 15:55.000]  what did you see with them and the reported bombs there was two different
[15:55.000 --> 15:59.840]  incidents where they they claimed that they had determined that there was a
[15:59.840 --> 16:06.960]  secondary explosive device they they quarantined that area I did not actually
[16:06.960 --> 16:13.560]  see them route removed the device from the building it was more to the northwest
[16:13.560 --> 16:17.880]  corner of the building from what I understood in the debris and I was still
[16:17.880 --> 16:23.320]  yet on the south side close to the elevator shafts but these evacuations
[16:23.320 --> 16:27.640]  did take place we have affidavits from first responders saying that there were
[16:27.640 --> 16:31.800]  at least two other bombs discovered in the rubble that one of these bombs was
[16:31.800 --> 16:36.720]  timed to go to go off 10 minutes after the first explosion this is a typical
[16:36.720 --> 16:41.320]  terrorist tactic is to have at least two bombs one to attract responders and the
[16:41.320 --> 16:45.040]  second bomb to inflict even greater casualties so they're I mean this could
[16:45.040 --> 16:48.840]  have been worse that's a bad thing about home city is as bad as it was it could
[16:48.840 --> 16:53.000]  have been much much worse now going through some of these questions what
[16:53.000 --> 16:57.320]  really got you asking questions and I'm going from memory in second hand dawn
[16:57.320 --> 17:01.720]  how did things progress with the feds telling you to get out of there were you
[17:01.720 --> 17:06.800]  ever threatened like some of the other police were yes sir at one point that
[17:06.800 --> 17:11.160]  morning I was advised that we were going to be arrested by federal marshals if we
[17:11.160 --> 17:17.280]  did not leave the immediate area like said we didn't want to be a hindrance
[17:17.280 --> 17:22.080]  didn't really understand what was going at that point so we did withdraw and
[17:22.080 --> 17:29.120]  stayed sequestered there on the courtyard yard area and hope so we were
[17:29.120 --> 17:34.560]  going to be allowed to go back in and interestingly we were advised at that
[17:34.560 --> 17:37.560]  point that no police dog would be allowed back in the building that there
[17:37.560 --> 17:42.880]  would be the search and rescue dogs will be coming in from private sources so
[17:42.880 --> 17:47.280]  they couldn't trust the Oklahoma City police that they'd have some special
[17:47.280 --> 17:52.960]  people coming I want to get into all the technicals and the horse patrol being
[17:52.960 --> 17:56.400]  mobilized before the bombing and what Terrence Gaggy saw and you know really
[17:56.400 --> 18:01.520]  the key points here with you sir but bottom line from 16 years of researching
[18:01.520 --> 18:05.640]  this being in it and what you know and seeing this film as a police officer as
[18:05.640 --> 18:10.360]  an investigator as a veteran with a lot of different perspectives and wisdom
[18:10.360 --> 18:14.960]  what do you believe really happened with Oklahoma City? I personally believe
[18:14.960 --> 18:18.760]  that there was a secondary explosion I don't know whether it was
[18:18.760 --> 18:24.560]  sympathetic to the truck explosion and that it was just armament that was
[18:24.560 --> 18:31.520]  stored in the Murray building but due to the destructive nature of what
[18:31.520 --> 18:36.920]  occurred in particularly in closer to the east side of the building on the
[18:36.920 --> 18:41.600]  south side where there was was this total destruction I do believe that there
[18:41.600 --> 18:47.400]  was at least a sympathetic explosion. Exactly then the damage pattern to the
[18:47.400 --> 18:50.440]  building when you look at it is asymmetrical to the truck bomb it's
[18:50.440 --> 18:53.880]  offset from the major damage to the building the craters offset from the
[18:53.880 --> 18:57.960]  major bite as we show in the movie. It's on the other end of the building from it
[18:57.960 --> 19:01.680]  and we can see it right behind you there the truck bomb was basically where your
[19:01.680 --> 19:07.840]  shoulder is Holland you're a shoulder that's facing inward towards Don and
[19:07.840 --> 19:12.200]  then if you see back in the corner where the earphone is where Don is that's
[19:12.200 --> 19:16.840]  that's where you had columns blown off at the base and Parton says that it was
[19:16.840 --> 19:21.520]  specifically charges on those columns. Yes we interviewed General Parton I
[19:21.520 --> 19:26.160]  believe one of the first interviews ever anyone's ever given him on on on
[19:26.160 --> 19:30.680]  video and he was a former head of Air Force weapons development he spent
[19:30.680 --> 19:34.000]  20 years blowing things up for the military and conducting bomb damage
[19:34.000 --> 19:37.760]  analysis this is his job he saw what happened in Oklahoma City he saw the
[19:37.760 --> 19:41.680]  damage he knew it could not be an ammonium nitrate truck bomb so he
[19:41.680 --> 19:46.200]  analyzed it his famous Parton report which concluded that the columns inside
[19:46.200 --> 19:50.360]  the Murray building were destroyed due to prezance damage meaning that there
[19:50.360 --> 19:55.320]  were contact explosives on the columns that the truck bomb was not the sole
[19:55.320 --> 19:58.800]  cause of destruction that day that truck bomb did do a lot of damage and it was
[19:58.800 --> 20:02.560]  powerful but what it would have done to the Murray building was basically blown
[20:02.560 --> 20:05.640]  in all the windows and damaged the facade and certainly well that's what you see in
[20:05.640 --> 20:10.000]  Saudi Arabia with trucks full of pull of military grade is it just blows the
[20:10.000 --> 20:14.040]  facade off and blows things through the building sometimes both sides but the
[20:14.040 --> 20:17.760]  columns are right there the supporting columns were there and the Murray
[20:17.760 --> 20:22.480]  building was constructed in the 70s with bomb resistance in mind because there
[20:22.480 --> 20:27.200]  was a lot more political instability going on in the post-60s era back communist
[20:27.200 --> 20:30.480]  bombing stuff yeah exactly it was a federal building was designed with it
[20:30.480 --> 20:35.360]  with bombs in mind and those columns would not have failed due to a truck
[20:35.360 --> 20:38.200]  bomb that is an impossibility in fact the American Society of Civil
[20:38.200 --> 20:43.160]  Engineers was not even allowed on site to do their own analysis they did an
[20:43.160 --> 20:46.400]  analysis but they were kept 200 feet back well that's another issue they
[20:46.400 --> 20:50.160]  blow up the wreckage more than half the building standing there they act super
[20:50.160 --> 20:55.000]  suspicious they threaten people Hoppy Hodlberg police officers doctors that
[20:55.000 --> 21:00.600]  show up the FVV ATF send their full gear like a minute after as a police
[21:00.600 --> 21:04.400]  officer Don watching them act so suspicious I mean what does that look
[21:04.400 --> 21:08.560]  like to you and what did other police officers tell you off record their view
[21:08.560 --> 21:14.360]  was on this I'll but one one of the bomb
[21:14.360 --> 21:20.160]  officers was describing to me one of what he thought was a one of the
[21:20.160 --> 21:23.960]  secondary devices and he said that he had a clock real similar to it sitting
[21:23.960 --> 21:31.360]  on his desk which was just a three-road stick dynamite with a alarm clock stuck
[21:31.360 --> 21:37.880]  on his kind of a decoration type thing and really was serious about trying to
[21:37.880 --> 21:44.840]  diss me if that's what they thought was a secondary device tonight of course we
[21:44.840 --> 21:48.160]  kind of then we got a little more more involved in our conversations and he
[21:48.160 --> 21:54.040]  said that they did find nitrous bottle in caps you know the other things that
[21:54.040 --> 21:58.560]  would help accelerate the info bomb exactly one of the stories they
[21:58.560 --> 22:02.280]  propagated to cover one of the evacuations that that that three
[22:02.280 --> 22:07.860]  different bomb squads had mistaken a toy alarm clock as a real bomb which
[22:07.860 --> 22:12.000]  is ludicrous and no reason to evacuate the entire building before that could
[22:12.000 --> 22:14.800]  actually be concluded as retained on the site you wouldn't evacuate the
[22:14.800 --> 22:17.480]  building before he actually determined that it was a bomb especially because
[22:17.480 --> 22:22.360]  there's people inside bleeding out but you've got pieces of the building blown
[22:22.360 --> 22:27.280]  the opposite direction away from the truck bomb on top the building across
[22:27.280 --> 22:31.400]  the street exactly that truck bomb exploded on the north side of the
[22:31.400 --> 22:35.640]  building yet north of that across the street there were chunks of the mirror
[22:35.640 --> 22:39.680]  building that somehow transported themselves against the blast wave of
[22:39.680 --> 22:43.440]  the truck bomb and that's the thing about this this whole story is that it is a
[22:43.440 --> 22:48.280]  conclusive fact that that truck bomb was not the sole cause of agent yet the
[22:48.280 --> 22:52.040]  cover-up has gone into effect everyone on the scene knows that the truck bomb
[22:52.040 --> 22:55.800]  was not the sole cause of destruction and we see how the mainstream media and
[22:55.800 --> 22:59.880]  the government is able to manipulate a story take what is actually reality
[22:59.880 --> 23:02.840]  which is that there were bombs inside the building that did most of the damage
[23:02.840 --> 23:06.440]  and change it to something else destroy the crime scene while there were still
[23:06.440 --> 23:11.360]  bodies inside a month after the bombing they demolished that building and
[23:11.360 --> 23:15.480]  there were still a number of people inside deceased persons of course but
[23:15.480 --> 23:19.680]  they they were in such a rush that they wouldn't even recover the bodies don was
[23:19.680 --> 23:26.440]  there for that right right yeah we did pull the in fact we had located one of
[23:26.440 --> 23:30.200]  the female victims that we had to leave inside the building on the night of the
[23:30.200 --> 23:36.840]  4th and the building was pretty unstable in that area but rather than trying to
[23:36.840 --> 23:42.440]  shore anything up we were removed the building was brought down and we were
[23:42.440 --> 23:48.960]  allowed to go back in the 29th of May and and research the area and did locate
[23:48.960 --> 23:53.600]  that lady along with one of her female companion workers and other gentlemen
[23:53.600 --> 23:58.400]  that had died in the blast well I know this is hard to talk about a lot of key
[23:58.400 --> 24:01.880]  questions we haven't gotten to yet here Don Browning retired Oklahoma City
[24:01.880 --> 24:06.080]  police officer canine rescue handler was there right after the one of the first
[24:06.080 --> 24:10.120]  people there on the scene the former US Marine Vietnam veteran as well could you
[24:10.120 --> 24:13.160]  tell us you've told us about the marshals threatening the police what
[24:13.160 --> 24:18.760]  about FBI threatening you specifically within the weeks that followed after
[24:18.760 --> 24:26.520]  the the actual currents FBI agents were assigned to set up a communication
[24:26.520 --> 24:32.400]  station at the Oklahoma City Police canine and equine center and they were
[24:32.400 --> 24:35.280]  in and out of our office through the day of course we were supposed to just
[24:35.280 --> 24:40.920]  conduct businesses normal and they were still concluding their investigations
[24:40.920 --> 24:46.560]  but was told more than once or twice by agents in the area that people like my
[24:46.560 --> 24:52.480]  wife and I would end up have ended up dead but not going along with what we
[24:52.480 --> 24:58.480]  need to be true well so you're a you're a decorated Vietnam veteran police
[24:58.480 --> 25:02.360]  officer one of the heroes that responded when there could have been other
[25:02.360 --> 25:08.040]  bombs and was thought there were other bombs and the FBI agents in the police
[25:08.040 --> 25:12.040]  office are telling you do what you're told or you and your wife are dead and
[25:12.040 --> 25:18.160]  you're you're saying this on record here sir yes sir please elaborate for the
[25:18.160 --> 25:22.000]  millions of listeners exactly what happened and you'd like to name names
[25:22.000 --> 25:27.760]  I'm not afraid of these people I'm as far as names I really don't know I do
[25:27.760 --> 25:32.800]  know there was an agent Jim height that had contacted me that was concerned
[25:32.800 --> 25:39.520]  about the health of the dogs right about the same time his story was that the
[25:39.520 --> 25:47.840]  building had been sprayed with a an agent similar to Agent Orange to try to
[25:47.840 --> 25:53.760]  slow decomposition in the thorough supposed it was complaints that the
[25:53.760 --> 26:00.200]  odor of the decomp is becoming an issue to the surrounding area in the
[26:00.200 --> 26:06.120]  community again there were just different things that occurred to just
[26:06.120 --> 26:10.160]  absolutely divide my understanding why they would why they would use
[26:10.160 --> 26:17.440]  something such as Agent Orange without warning I've said of what they were
[26:17.440 --> 26:24.320]  doing but I mean separately how did I mean did they phone call you I mean did
[26:24.320 --> 26:26.920]  an agent in the hall say hey you better do what you're told are you and your
[26:26.920 --> 26:31.000]  wife or dad I mean I mean how would they talk to you no they were it was person
[26:31.000 --> 26:34.040]  person in the hallway they're in the officer at the canine center so they
[26:34.040 --> 26:37.920]  say do what you're told are you and your wife are dead right and what did you say
[26:37.920 --> 26:47.240]  to that wasn't wasn't too much I'd say I got y'all right and I was not at that
[26:47.240 --> 26:53.000]  time was really not in a good mood to hear their crap I had a major from our
[26:53.000 --> 26:57.400]  department that was telling me that I needed to find new friends and he thought
[26:57.400 --> 27:01.760]  I was part of the militia okay so they're intimidating you they're
[27:01.760 --> 27:05.440]  isolating you and then they're they're threatening you and your wife in a
[27:05.440 --> 27:10.560]  hallway I mean I just there's it's so unbelievable you probably had one of
[27:10.560 --> 27:15.560]  the perpetrators right there with you I just oh my god well I mean that's that's
[27:15.560 --> 27:18.240]  one of the thing about the one of the things about this when you see the
[27:18.240 --> 27:23.000]  behavior of the federal agents on the scene and afterwards it makes you
[27:23.000 --> 27:28.920]  question what their mission is entirely because they were not responding in a
[27:28.920 --> 27:34.120]  professional manner they pulled people back to pull off the videotapes don you
[27:34.120 --> 27:39.200]  witnessed that yes I watched while we were being sequestered there in a
[27:39.200 --> 27:44.960]  courtyard I did watch agents with raid ATR I'm sorry FBI raid jackets on
[27:44.960 --> 27:49.280]  removing cameras from video cameras from the corners of the mirror building
[27:49.280 --> 27:52.400]  tapes that we've never seen those cameras would have recorded everything
[27:52.400 --> 27:55.440]  that happened in front of the mirror building you know if we are if we are
[27:55.440 --> 27:59.280]  wrong and they want to prove it you know if you can show the tape that shows
[27:59.280 --> 28:02.200]  McVay getting out of that truck and that truck causing the damage that building
[28:02.200 --> 28:05.520]  I'll go home and I'll never talk well they've declared national security some
[28:05.520 --> 28:10.360]  good FBI agents have gone public as you know in the LA Times nine years ago and
[28:10.360 --> 28:14.120]  they said they've seen the tapes there's 20 something of them and it does show
[28:14.120 --> 28:17.960]  McVay with a bunch of other men and that's why the government doesn't want
[28:17.960 --> 28:23.320]  it released exactly and they don't see the secret service timeline records that
[28:23.320 --> 28:27.440]  when they looked at the tape that there were suspects exiting the truck three
[28:27.440 --> 28:31.360]  minutes after was parked plural that means multiple suspects but to this day
[28:31.360 --> 28:35.640]  they insist McVay was the only person who drove that truck up Don Barney
[28:35.640 --> 28:40.080]  mentioned Dana Bradley earlier during the trial of McVay in Denver they could
[28:40.080 --> 28:44.360]  only produce one witness who could place McVay in Oklahoma City that was Dana
[28:44.360 --> 28:48.680]  Bradley she lost her children and her mother and her leg in the bombing she
[28:48.680 --> 28:52.320]  gains notoriety views she was trapped in the rubble and they had to amputate on
[28:52.320 --> 28:56.960]  site under cross-examination she admitted that when she was in the Social
[28:56.960 --> 29:01.160]  Security Office waiting in line she saw that writer truck pull up Tim McVay got
[29:01.160 --> 29:05.800]  out of one side and a suspect another man got out of the other side under
[29:05.800 --> 29:10.680]  cross-examination admitted this and then the federal prosecutors tried to drag
[29:10.680 --> 29:14.360]  her name through the mud and say that she had misremembered the day that it
[29:14.360 --> 29:18.440]  was another day that she had lost her entire family and her leg that she saw
[29:18.440 --> 29:22.800]  that writer truck pull up with two people it's just ludicrous and insulting
[29:22.800 --> 29:29.040]  unbelievable we have Holland Vanden Neuhoff investigator filmmaker and Don
[29:29.040 --> 29:34.600]  Browning Oklahoma City police officer US Marine Vietnam veteran was one of the

[29:38.280 --> 29:42.640]  police officer that responded on the other side folks I don't like risking my
[29:42.640 --> 29:46.160]  life to expose these people but we've got to they're getting ready to do it

[33:01.840 --> 33:10.640]  defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's Alex Jones
[33:10.640 --> 33:16.800]  Oklahoma City is real simple the ATF even got a rider truck and practice
[33:16.800 --> 33:20.000]  blowing it up a few months before in New Mexico that even came out on Discovery
[33:20.000 --> 33:25.080]  Channel they were embarrassed that they wanted to get any terror funding and
[33:25.080 --> 33:28.880]  laws passed that they've now gotten through a course in 93 so they torched
[33:28.880 --> 33:35.600]  Waco that blew up in their face and so then they carried out Oklahoma City to
[33:35.600 --> 33:39.760]  blame it on domestic groups and on the state's rights movement and to make Bill
[33:39.760 --> 33:43.120]  Clinton look like a victim he could demonize talk radio and conservatives
[33:43.120 --> 33:48.040]  and then I mean it was so obvious by their instant response in minutes it was
[33:48.040 --> 33:52.640]  all scripted and I remember being in Austin and people were mailing the tapes
[33:52.640 --> 33:55.480]  down and putting them on access TV that's why I went down and got an access
[33:55.480 --> 34:01.240]  TV show in 95 was watching the soap opera every week of the tapes mailed down
[34:01.240 --> 34:04.880]  to patriots from Oklahoma City and the other patriots locally putting it on
[34:04.880 --> 34:08.080]  with the bombs coming out of the building and general part in at press
[34:08.080 --> 34:12.320]  conferences and Hoppy Heidelberg being threatened and you know all this stuff
[34:12.320 --> 34:17.480]  going on and then you find out that so many of these other events have been
[34:17.480 --> 34:22.600]  staged and and then to have these police officers killed and threatened and and
[34:22.600 --> 34:26.120]  Department of Defense people that were there for bomb disposal threatened we
[34:26.120 --> 34:29.880]  know where your daughter lives wait where your daughter goes to school again
[34:29.880 --> 34:34.960]  ladies and gentlemen you can say well I would you know punch him in the nose or
[34:34.960 --> 34:40.080]  whatever but imagine being in a police headquarters and FBI guys come over when
[34:40.080 --> 34:42.640]  you're walking on the hall and say you and your wife are gonna get it if you
[34:42.640 --> 34:47.400]  don't stop what you're doing I mean wow I mean why would an FBI agent do that
[34:47.400 --> 34:52.280]  unless they were involved I mean you're now threatening to kill cops and their
[34:52.280 --> 34:58.360]  wives that's who runs this government and the same crew is in charge now the
[34:58.360 --> 35:01.800]  guy that's the Attorney General he was deputy Attorney General then and in
[35:01.800 --> 35:07.440]  lawsuits his emails and memos have come out where he's like April 20th we got to
[35:07.440 --> 35:13.480]  get to Oklahoma and this is D-day these are quotes and cover this up cover what
[35:13.480 --> 35:17.880]  up cover what up
[35:17.880 --> 35:22.680]  happen in Oklahoma City Eric Holder was it was in charge of the investigation for
[35:22.680 --> 35:26.080]  the Justice Department he managed the investigation later in charge of the
[35:26.080 --> 35:29.720]  Trinity to cover up now Attorney General United States and now he has gun walker
[35:29.720 --> 35:34.280]  all over this man has killed thousands of people that's in the headlines now why
[35:34.280 --> 35:40.400]  is it so hard to believe that in operation in 1995 kill 168 people yes
[35:40.400 --> 35:44.600]  sir that's a good point mr. Browning again retired Oklahoma City police
[35:44.600 --> 35:48.480]  officer was one of the first to respond I mean that's a false flag staged event
[35:48.480 --> 35:52.200]  right there where they weren't just letting them get sold at gun shops that
[35:52.200 --> 35:57.080]  was the cover we now know 18 wheelers into Mexico and in the federal cases
[35:57.080 --> 36:03.440]  drugs back in I mean Eric Holder is just a mob boss well you were talking about
[36:03.440 --> 36:07.280]  you had hoppy Heidelberg on this show earlier this week you were talking about
[36:07.280 --> 36:10.480]  the threats he received what's interesting about that is that the FBI
[36:10.480 --> 36:14.920]  agents who threaten hoppy Heidelberg is named John Hursley John Hursley was
[36:14.920 --> 36:19.480]  basically the FBI's representative to the prosecution during the trial John
[36:19.480 --> 36:23.280]  Hursley was there with his partner threatening hoppy Heidelberg with a gun
[36:23.280 --> 36:27.480]  if he kept on talking about what had happened behind closed doors at the
[36:27.480 --> 36:33.040]  grand jury that indicted McVay and Nichols and others unknown John Hursley is
[36:33.040 --> 36:36.760]  now the go-to guy for the history channel or and whoever else wants to do
[36:36.760 --> 36:40.800]  an apology for the official story John Hursley is there in a suit and tie with
[36:40.800 --> 36:43.760]  the American flag behind him representing the United States government
[36:43.760 --> 36:49.280]  that man is a thug he threatens people with guns and he's on TV trying to
[36:49.280 --> 36:53.680]  explain the official story in fact he wrote a book a ghost ghost wrote a book
[36:53.680 --> 36:58.240]  about the bombing about the official story and the title is called simple
[36:58.240 --> 37:04.160]  truths simple truths which is always what the Nobel is cloaked in a simple
[37:04.160 --> 37:12.440]  truth Don what were you looking into that made FBI agents threaten not only you
[37:12.440 --> 37:20.200]  but to kill your wife I was trying to follow up had a lot of citizens that
[37:20.200 --> 37:24.920]  was calling given information we're trying to follow through with with
[37:24.920 --> 37:29.400]  different Tibbets of information is getting even from persons such as
[37:29.400 --> 37:37.040]  Janie Carverdale and Glennon Wilbur and his wife I felt obligated as a police
[37:37.040 --> 37:42.960]  officer that that we should be looking into all those things and they were
[37:42.960 --> 37:49.840]  pretty frustrated that that for the most part they were being ignored or being
[37:49.840 --> 37:56.400]  told it didn't matter it was it was similar to like Dana Bradley I would
[37:56.400 --> 38:02.260]  mentioned earlier I was called into the U.S. Attorney's Office and was
[38:02.260 --> 38:07.960]  questioned as to what she said to me the entire time that I was near her I
[38:07.960 --> 38:17.320]  wanted to know every if and but every I ever T she was groaning she was in pain
[38:17.320 --> 38:24.120]  there was no noticeable conversation that came from her but they wanted to
[38:24.120 --> 38:28.720]  know what she'd seen and what she told you exactly and the woman penned under
[38:28.720 --> 38:32.640]  giant girders who lost her leg and they're wanting to know what did she
[38:32.640 --> 38:35.760]  say what did she say so as a police officer you're saying the feds were
[38:35.760 --> 38:41.280]  acting super guilty yes sir yes sir there was it was well I was told at the
[38:41.280 --> 38:45.640]  time that they were going to have to repeat what she was saying apparently
[38:45.640 --> 38:51.520]  she was and she was delirious me to her entries and her losses I bet you know
[38:51.520 --> 38:55.480]  she'd lost family members again in there incredible let's let's talk about
[38:55.480 --> 38:58.720]  Terrence Gaggy tell us about this gentleman who was one of the first
[38:58.720 --> 39:02.440]  people along with you to respond we're running into the building that you know
[39:02.440 --> 39:08.920]  just been devastated and then what happened to him why this is so important
[39:08.920 --> 39:15.040]  well Terry first off was was a remarkable young man he was he was very
[39:15.040 --> 39:21.280]  likable I did not work with him as shoulder to shoulder in our assignments
[39:21.280 --> 39:25.320]  at the police department however I did work a lot of extra jobs and security
[39:25.320 --> 39:31.800]  work with him not good friends but friends enough that especially after the
[39:31.800 --> 39:37.120]  bombing I would always teach Terry about man you're my hero you know you you
[39:37.120 --> 39:42.000]  live now you just you're my hero yeah we made the cover of newsweek right yeah
[39:42.000 --> 39:50.000]  yeah he hauled a lot of people out right yes sir and Terry bless his heart
[39:50.000 --> 39:55.640]  right off the bat was concerned because the worst many FBI and ATF agents on
[39:55.640 --> 40:01.160]  the scene even when he drove up turn to drive up and there's feds and in their
[40:01.160 --> 40:05.520]  gear running around everywhere what 30 seconds after yeah he showed up just
[40:05.520 --> 40:09.360]  minutes after eternity he was the first officer to respond he pulls up and there
[40:09.360 --> 40:14.320]  are FBI agents on scene the FBI headquarters is five miles away they
[40:14.320 --> 40:18.600]  have no business why are ATF agents and FBI agents at the scene of the bombing
[40:18.600 --> 40:22.280]  sitting there watching what's going on when the first officer to respond pulls
[40:22.280 --> 40:28.440]  up well they were proud of their work I mean well there was an operation going
[40:28.440 --> 40:31.680]  on have blown up some kids in a daycare that's that's that's that's what tough
[40:31.680 --> 40:36.360]  guys do well Don you were given privy information about a surveillance
[40:36.360 --> 40:41.160]  operation by the FBI that was going on at the time right concerning the
[40:41.160 --> 40:45.000]  vehicle description yeah they always claim that so when it happens oh well it
[40:45.000 --> 40:50.680]  was a sting went bad yeah well no quite interestingly the the morning of the
[40:50.680 --> 40:57.960]  bombing as I was in in route downtown there were some casting me a three
[40:57.960 --> 41:04.360]  vehicle description along with the seven Persian mills that were supposed to
[41:04.360 --> 41:10.320]  occupy these vehicles that they had left on the interstate systems from the
[41:10.320 --> 41:15.120]  we're a building area and surprisingly we were told that these vehicles were
[41:15.120 --> 41:21.160]  still under surveillance and continued the FBI said that yes so the FBI told the
[41:21.160 --> 41:26.640]  police that they were watching the suspects but the building blows up and
[41:26.640 --> 41:30.840]  they don't stop the suspects but no no please don't understand this supposedly
[41:30.840 --> 41:35.680]  was afterwards this was the supposed to get suspects of the bombing sure sure
[41:35.680 --> 41:43.360]  yeah that went on through all the morning up until about 1 30 at that
[41:43.360 --> 41:46.440]  point I had an opportunity to speak to one of the FBI agents that had kind of
[41:46.440 --> 41:52.720]  slow to take a break and asking what the status was and was informed at that
[41:52.720 --> 41:59.160]  point that that was disinformation that was designed to throw the press off and
[41:59.160 --> 42:06.920]  was nothing but disinformation I became very irate at the time and that they
[42:06.920 --> 42:11.120]  were they were broadcasting as to a five-state area it was not only throwing
[42:11.120 --> 42:16.880]  all the media off it was throwing every cop in the world off as well if this was
[42:16.880 --> 42:21.440]  fictitious information well the perps want to throw folks off so so Karen
[42:21.440 --> 42:26.680]  shaggy pulls up a minute or so after and it's crawling with FBI and ATF and then
[42:26.680 --> 42:34.720]  what happens next well he goes ahead and works with the recovery from one
[42:34.720 --> 42:40.680]  understand over this next few days after after that instant he had started
[42:40.680 --> 42:46.840]  to complain to Janet Reno and to others about the treatment that he was getting
[42:46.840 --> 42:51.040]  from the FBI agents and also from from the fact that there were so many of them
[42:51.040 --> 42:56.480]  on the scene it was quite quite concerning to him we talked a little bit
[42:56.480 --> 43:03.280]  about some of his concerns and some of my concerns but we both were still I'd
[43:03.280 --> 43:08.840]  say it was still wasn't really that trustworthy even of one another it was
[43:08.840 --> 43:13.520]  a time where you really didn't know who you could trust completely or not sure
[43:13.520 --> 43:17.360]  if you're not a completely unconscious moron you pull up and there's it's like
[43:17.360 --> 43:20.880]  watching a guy run out of a bank with a mask on a bag of money you know who you
[43:20.880 --> 43:24.320]  pull up there's feds running around and they're in their full gear right after
[43:24.320 --> 43:28.760]  it happens you're like what's going on oh nothing in fact there were doctors in
[43:28.760 --> 43:32.120]  people there who they would say patch me up I was up on the ninth floor and the
[43:32.120 --> 43:35.440]  doctors are like well you there's nothing wrong with you you weren't up there
[43:35.440 --> 43:38.520]  and he's like well you're gonna end up dead if you need you know don't do what
[43:38.520 --> 43:42.640]  I say I mean this death-threading I just can't imagine people just I'm a fed
[43:42.640 --> 43:46.440]  and I'm gonna death-threat police and everybody else because I'm God I mean
[43:46.440 --> 43:53.040]  sounds like a bunch of lunatics they are it was interesting I said with with
[43:53.040 --> 44:00.880]  Terry in that when Terry died he was not treated as a normal police officer
[44:00.880 --> 44:08.240]  there was no autopsy performed he of course was viewed by a medical
[44:08.240 --> 44:15.560]  examiner and they did complete the best certificate in follow-up reports but no
[44:15.560 --> 44:24.920]  autopsy nothing to describe why the injuries that Terry had suffered where
[44:24.920 --> 44:28.440]  they came from or what what type of injuries those were but we do have
[44:28.440 --> 44:31.840]  because that what thanks to Colonel Craig Roberts going from memory we do have
[44:31.840 --> 44:35.960]  the basic medical examiner's drawings and and of course that you know you guys
[44:35.960 --> 44:38.680]  have talked to some of the witnesses and some of the Sheriff's Department I know
[44:38.680 --> 44:42.680]  from the county over that that did show up reportedly and so go over this in
[44:42.680 --> 44:47.280]  detail the feds are like digging dirt up yeah Terrence Yaggy's obviously been
[44:47.280 --> 44:50.680]  tortured I mean as a police officer go over what happened to him
[44:50.680 --> 44:59.280]  Terry had numerous lacerations on his wrist across his elbows on both arms he
[44:59.280 --> 45:04.880]  had a long cut that began just underneath his right ear extended past his
[45:04.880 --> 45:10.240]  Adam's apple there was another small hesitation cut on the left side of his
[45:10.240 --> 45:17.000]  throat you think that was when they were just threatening to slit his throat to
[45:17.000 --> 45:20.680]  get the answers or where the stuff was well I was told by the district attorney
[45:20.680 --> 45:25.080]  when I went to the grand jury that was due to EMT trying to save Terry's life
[45:25.080 --> 45:29.800]  no and of course he'd been dead well I mean let's go over and let's talk about
[45:29.800 --> 45:33.360]  how he died because I mean he was telling his partner I got feds behind me
[45:33.360 --> 45:38.360]  last time he was heard from right Terry Terry was transporting documents and
[45:38.360 --> 45:43.000]  evidence that he had collected he called his friend the police officer said
[45:43.000 --> 45:47.080]  let's meet for dinner as soon as I shake these feds who are following me will
[45:47.080 --> 45:51.280]  meet Terry went to El Reno Terry grew up in El Reno Oklahoma he knew all the
[45:51.280 --> 45:57.080]  back roads and his car is found on federal property El Reno has a federal
[45:57.080 --> 45:59.880]  prison the reason the federal government was able to come in and take
[45:59.880 --> 46:04.080]  control investigation was that his body was found on federal land yes they did
[46:04.080 --> 46:10.200]  that again wow exactly and when his he had handcuffed marks on his wrists there
[46:10.200 --> 46:14.440]  was mud packed into his wounds there was no way he could have drug himself through
[46:14.440 --> 46:19.880]  the mud a mile and a half through creeks and trees while bleeding and then
[46:19.880 --> 46:24.360]  decided to shoot himself at an angle at the top of his head coming out the
[46:24.360 --> 46:28.640]  lower part of his jaw sure so let me ask this cops everybody shows up I mean you
[46:28.640 --> 46:31.480]  talk about the county shows up and they said yeah the feds were covering it up
[46:31.480 --> 46:34.520]  and the police all just stand around and well they killed him that's I mean
[46:34.520 --> 46:37.480]  that's all the police we've talked to yeah they killed him and I guess that's
[46:37.480 --> 46:41.680]  just what the feds are God they want to kill cops go ahead you know well as was
[46:41.680 --> 46:47.640]  interesting to me to at that point was anytime we had a police officer involved
[46:47.640 --> 46:51.480]  in automobile accident or anything outside of the city limits the city still
[46:51.480 --> 46:57.480]  sent the investigative officers out to investigate the accident nothing else to
[46:57.480 --> 47:04.440]  supplement whatever agency did do the investigation with Terry it was just
[47:04.440 --> 47:08.680]  basically our agency just washed their hands of it and turned it completely over
[47:08.680 --> 47:14.720]  to the FBI and yeah whatever police officer dies uncle see there's always
[47:14.720 --> 47:18.320]  an autopsy a couple years ago police officer died in a car wreck and there
[47:18.320 --> 47:22.040]  was no question about why he had died it was on duty he was responding to a call
[47:22.040 --> 47:25.880]  they still perform an autopsy yet they find a police officer just a couple years
[47:25.880 --> 47:32.520]  before in a field cut bleeding a year after a year after he's the hero of
[47:32.520 --> 47:36.520]  Oklahoma City on the cover of Newsweek and police officer of the year shot in
[47:36.520 --> 47:41.600]  the head and they do not perform an autopsy once again it does not hold up
[47:41.600 --> 47:46.200]  to scrutiny at all who is who was this this police chief I mean who is either
[47:46.200 --> 47:52.680]  purely wicked or the biggest coward on the planet he was a chief Gonzalez was
[47:52.680 --> 47:57.320]  from the Dallas Fort Worth area had been on Dallas PD a priority is being hired
[47:57.320 --> 48:03.960]  with Oklahoma City he really didn't have connections to Oklahoma City and would
[48:03.960 --> 48:10.920]  frequently leave for extended weekends to go play golf in Dallas really never
[48:10.920 --> 48:14.840]  did feel like he was a portion of our department at all so he was just a he's
[48:14.840 --> 48:19.880]  just a placeholder yes sir he's also a young patrolman in Dallas on November
[48:19.880 --> 48:27.320]  22nd 1963 oh really mm-hmm so he's a very trustworthy person
[48:27.320 --> 48:31.040]  no I don't know if he had any involvement with that but that's that is
[48:31.040 --> 48:37.480]  his background I like Dan rather okay continuing here there's a lot of other
[48:37.480 --> 48:40.760]  points here that are important you tell us about the horse patrol being
[48:40.760 --> 48:46.640]  mobilized for crowd control prior to the bombing yes sir again that was one of
[48:46.640 --> 48:51.560]  the things that kind of surprised me the horse patrol basically through the week
[48:51.560 --> 48:59.800]  did not patrol any area they maybe once or twice one or two of the officers would
[48:59.800 --> 49:04.520]  settle up and they would go into the stockard area horses are for special
[49:04.520 --> 49:10.120]  events right I mean big crowds yes sir interestingly they had any time we did
[49:10.120 --> 49:14.160]  work a big event they would have the county reserve would also come in and
[49:14.160 --> 49:21.920]  supplement the with horses and manpower and they would act out together the
[49:21.920 --> 49:29.320]  morning of the bombing the horse patrol was going downtown in force they
[49:29.320 --> 49:32.560]  claim they really don't know why they were going down there wasn't necessary
[49:32.560 --> 49:37.680]  for crowd control they was going down to to work the downtown area this was
[49:37.680 --> 49:44.560]  about a week before what we were scheduled to have a an art festival that
[49:44.560 --> 49:49.560]  would mandated that they would have had to be there so it was it they were they
[49:49.560 --> 49:52.680]  were coming up on some time frame where a lot of overtime was going to be
[49:52.680 --> 49:58.720]  required so it's kind of surprising that they would just out of the blue decide
[49:58.720 --> 50:04.240]  together and go downtown to do this this quite large work patrol there was
[50:04.240 --> 50:10.000]  probably somewhere between eight to ten riders and horses that were in route was
[50:10.000 --> 50:14.520]  that order to settle up given before the bombing yes sir they were they were
[50:14.520 --> 50:18.520]  actually leaving and would have already been downtown by the time the bomb went
[50:18.520 --> 50:22.520]  off according to one of the supervisors had it not been for one of our officers
[50:22.520 --> 50:27.440]  was slow in getting ready and they were just pulling out of the canine
[50:27.440 --> 50:32.640]  equine center when the bomb detonated are we come back I'm gonna ask you what
[50:32.640 --> 50:37.200]  do the rank and file Oklahoma City police think 16 17 years after this

[54:13.720 --> 54:18.320]  beat up before when I was exposing the Waco situation in the trial and bull
[54:18.320 --> 54:22.880]  horning the judge and they sent five guys four of them attacked me beat me up
[54:22.880 --> 54:26.440]  pretty bad but I beat them up too at a parking lot telling me shut up they broke
[54:26.440 --> 54:30.120]  my nose and punched me I mean they're not but you know what that was when I
[54:30.120 --> 54:35.440]  knew how real this was okay and the federal government is run by a bunch
[54:35.440 --> 54:39.960]  of criminals now who just think that we're here to be doormats and our
[54:39.960 --> 54:45.440]  property our children belong to them and we can beat these people but let me tell
[54:45.440 --> 54:49.920]  you living in denial this isn't about just criticizing the government we come
[54:49.920 --> 54:53.400]  up with fanciful tales this is a police officer who was there and saw all this
[54:53.400 --> 54:57.960]  who had FBI agents threatened to kill him and his wife other cops got killed
[54:57.960 --> 55:03.080]  doctors got killed rangers got threatened these are FBI comes to your
[55:03.080 --> 55:07.720]  house with guns and says shut your mouth now people come and say you're dead if
[55:07.720 --> 55:14.440]  you keep this up this is what they do I mean and and somebody's got a column on
[55:14.440 --> 55:19.080]  it somebody's got to realize it that this country I mean they're now
[55:19.080 --> 55:22.360]  announcing they're gonna use the military against the American people we
[55:22.360 --> 55:26.640]  get the Department of Defense contact Joe Joseph calls us and says if you seen
[55:26.640 --> 55:30.920]  this is on the federal government's own website and then they pull it where they
[55:30.920 --> 55:35.400]  they call the American people the enemy the red group and the government is the
[55:35.400 --> 55:40.040]  blue group and I mean the general public is listed as the enemy that's not the
[55:40.040 --> 55:44.160]  American government you get a police officers questioning and they go we
[55:44.160 --> 55:47.120]  think you're in a militia implying they were involved in it because they're
[55:47.120 --> 55:54.320]  asking questions you cannot control reality by being delusional you can't
[55:54.320 --> 55:57.320]  just say oh this couldn't be true like the awesome police chief said two weeks
[55:57.320 --> 56:01.240]  ago when I was talking to him privately and I looked in his eyes and I could
[56:01.240 --> 56:06.120]  tell he's not stupid he says he listens to the show he knows and he said some
[56:06.120 --> 56:09.400]  things privately to me I don't want to give him more trouble not saying what he
[56:09.400 --> 56:12.520]  said he didn't say it's off record he's just like yeah I'll probably never get
[56:12.520 --> 56:16.000]  promoted above Austin because I'm even on your show but I don't care anymore
[56:16.000 --> 56:19.840]  Alex I know you're a good guy I'll see you later but the point is that's not
[56:19.840 --> 56:24.800]  enough you've I can tell our police chiefs a real person he's you've got to
[56:24.800 --> 56:28.480]  choose what side you're on in closing Don Browning and people can get the film
[56:28.480 --> 56:31.360]  which people have given their lives for you to be able to know this information
[56:31.360 --> 56:34.880]  noble lie at him full wars calm get out to everybody in the two or three minutes
[56:34.880 --> 56:39.000]  we've got left with you and Holland and a new and off what are the other police
[56:39.000 --> 56:45.120]  officers around you say or I mean do they just give in to the big lie it's
[56:45.120 --> 56:51.240]  interesting mmm it's kind of a combination of both where some are
[56:51.240 --> 57:01.440]  literally scared to death Terry Yankees good buddy at one point met me short
[57:01.440 --> 57:05.480]  effort Terry had died told me that I was on the right track please keep one
[57:05.480 --> 57:11.600]  pushing Terry deserve that but he couldn't help me and
[57:11.600 --> 57:17.960]  officer for the most part do or at least at this point starting to finally
[57:17.960 --> 57:22.320]  come out with the feelings and emotions that they they did not eat the story
[57:22.320 --> 57:27.800]  they didn't battle it but they did not eat the information was handed out to
[57:27.800 --> 57:32.040]  us why didn't you guys just why didn't you guys get together and circle the
[57:32.040 --> 57:36.880]  wagons and say we got guns to you want to threaten us at the time of the
[57:36.880 --> 57:39.800]  circling of the wagons I don't think we felt like there was enough of us to
[57:39.800 --> 57:44.080]  circle even half of the circle so we didn't hit them well there wasn't at
[57:44.080 --> 57:48.760]  the Alamo either but we appreciate your incredible courage sir but sometimes it
[57:48.760 --> 57:51.960]  takes some of us getting wiped out so other people can see and then that's
[57:51.960 --> 57:55.880]  when we get the victory what was interesting I'll share a comment that
[57:55.880 --> 58:02.240]  Stephen Jones made when I was up at McRae's trial Jones came to me he had
[58:02.240 --> 58:07.000]  been part of the Roger Dill Stafford defense team when Roger Dill Stafford
[58:07.000 --> 58:11.960]  had committed the surveillance arcade murders and I had testified in that case
[58:11.960 --> 58:18.760]  as well and my head as I was walking up towards him coming back to the
[58:18.760 --> 58:25.400]  hotel and he stopped me and he says you know if only four or five of them said
[58:25.400 --> 58:28.640]  the homicide detectives would investigate this we'd have this solved in
[58:28.640 --> 58:32.960]  two or three days and I'll tell you what sir we're out of time but you've been

[01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:51.600]  found it holy mackerel that's the military waging war against the
[01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:56.600]  American people and putting us in FEMA camps absolute smoking gun to FEMA oh
[01:04:56.600 --> 01:05:03.080]  my god hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone
[01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:07.720]  this is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this
[01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:11.720]  agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:16.840]  turning men's influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:21.480]  calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:25.840]  citizens to pay attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our
[01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:31.100]  nation the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on

[01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:19.880]  joined us I just got completely blown away it was Nancy the caller who called
[01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:28.400]  us I guess on Monday and said yeah you found the Haliburton documents where
[01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:31.880]  they're now gonna man the FEMA camps that even Wall Street Journal admits they
[01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:36.760]  built in 96 or 2006 excuse me but do you know about the Department of Defense
[01:08:36.760 --> 01:08:43.280]  master order and then we got hit by so many emails we didn't get hers or lost
[01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:48.280]  it people pointed out June where they were doing purchase orders the one she
[01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:51.080]  tried to send us and that she just called in and mentioned that we just
[01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:55.160]  pulled up on screen is on Homeland Security's website it admits the
[01:08:55.160 --> 01:09:00.200]  military and the NSA is gonna run it and talks about the military the other
[01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:07.280]  stockades the barricades and blue force communications against the red force
[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:11.440]  now that's all code but I've been in the urban warfare drills and I was talking
[01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:14.400]  to her off air and I said well how do you know because I mean certainly red
[01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:17.600]  force blue force the command and communication of their blue force that
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:21.080]  that's military parlance for war that's how they they call themselves
[01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:24.680]  generally the blue force I've been the Marine Corps drills where it's you they
[01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:27.760]  got it all up on big satellite projections of where the troops are blue
[01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:32.160]  force red force where they're training to take on quote the militias in San
[01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:36.760]  Francisco and Oakland I shot that in 99 Operation Urban Warrior and she said
[01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:42.560]  well I mean she knows about it because she's she's there folks this is people
[01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:46.880]  in them well she's she said she's down hold I'm not gonna say much more than
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:50.240]  that we've got a guest already scheduled but I'm gonna have her pop in at the
[01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:55.880]  bottom of the hour and the computer we were getting all this up on we had to go
[01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:58.320]  to Skype and get our guests on we're pulling it up on another computer
[01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:02.080]  highlighting it all but I read it there on screen you're watching prison planet
[01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:06.640]  TV you saw me this is the Homeland Security FEMA website Department of
[01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:13.280]  Defense you know a bid system and it's super ultra creepy and really upsets me
[01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:18.160]  because you've got the state reps calling for martial law in Illinois and on
[01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:24.040]  CNN and in New Orleans in Chicago in New Orleans you've got the calls for
[01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:28.320]  checkpoints to be set up all over the country you've got the NDAA passing and
[01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:32.560]  the and same we'll use the military against citizens we found C-SPAN video
[01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:37.880]  from last Thursday where they talk about killing US citizens I mean that's
[01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:42.480]  gonna be on the nightly news tonight my head is my head is even spinning this is
[01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:48.280]  a giant buildup for war against us and I was really impressed a few weeks ago
[01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:53.040]  when I was talking about the NDAA on the biggest overnight talk show in the
[01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:57.560]  country second biggest in the world a coast-to-coast AM and they had a Greg
[01:10:57.560 --> 01:11:03.280]  Hunter on after me I can't remember it was before me the point is I heard him on
[01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:07.600]  the show and he heads up USA watchdog.com I've seen some of their great
[01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:12.000]  reports but the way he understood it all tied it all in where he saw the world
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:16.400]  going before creating and producing the site Greg spent nine years as a network
[01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:19.440]  and investigative correspondent he worked for ABC News and Good Morning America
[01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:23.320]  so great journalist the most recently Greg worked for CNN for shows such as
[01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:27.480]  Paula's on American Morning and various CNN business shows Greg's a hard-hitting
[01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:30.400]  reporter who has a history of getting the truth out no matter how difficult the
[01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:34.240]  subject USA watchdog.com now Greg obviously you being in the media know
[01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:37.760]  about breaking news I am on the Department of Defense site during the break
[01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:41.760]  the caller calls in and says look I already tried to give us to you once look
[01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:46.280]  at it it talks about FEMA camps being manned by the Department of Defense
[01:11:46.280 --> 01:11:51.760]  contractors and military and Red Force in combat with Blue Force what is what
[01:11:51.760 --> 01:12:01.680]  do you make of that breaking news? Well I think the war is coming down because you just look at the numbers of what
[01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:05.320]  what they're doing and the people and what they're saying just out in the
[01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:08.760]  general press I don't try to do anything other than really just analyze the news
[01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:14.360]  and things that Christine Lagarde the head of the IMF has said recently that
[01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:18.120]  things are intensifying that they're not only unfolding but they're intensifying
[01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:21.800]  this is what you're saying in the press on top of it you know you have the old
[01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:27.320]  Dominic Strauss-Kahn the former chief of the IMF who's is saying basically they
[01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:31.840]  have a growth problem they have a debt problem the EU has a leadership problem
[01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:35.720]  and he only gives it weeks now they just dumped a bunch of money into that bailout
[01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:40.600]  fund but if you believe the people who handle money for a living the $500
[01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:44.880]  billion they put in it or $600 billion whatever it is so far this is what
[01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:47.640]  they're reporting and who knows what they're doing behind the scenes but if
[01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:50.760]  you if you take a look at people who handle money for the for a living they
[01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:55.160]  say it's gonna cost trillions that it just looks like this is gonna collapse
[01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:58.760]  and this is this is how we got all of our debt incidentally over the last 30
[01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:02.720]  years that we would just continually borrow money and borrow money and
[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:06.160]  and borrow money and create more debt and nobody ever intends to pay this off
[01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:10.120]  obviously it's unbelievable amounts of debt than the hundreds of trillions of
[01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:14.800]  dollars just derivatives alone according to the Bank of International
[01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:19.360]  Settlements have grown a hundred trillion so what that tells me if they're
[01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:23.120]  giving they're handling the debt situation with more debt and incidentally
[01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:26.480]  this money in Europe they're not paying anything off to giving people more
[01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:32.920]  loans debt they're putting debt on top of debt and this is a how long it's a problem
[01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:37.640]  and by the numbers by the math of it I just don't see how it stays afloat just
[01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:44.720]  by the numbers on the face of it but the whole the worldwide economy
[01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:50.280]  well I totally agree with you I'm just dumbfounded by the sense that you're
[01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:56.680]  speaking here in fact I have the article you mentioned from AFP and
[01:13:56.680 --> 01:14:02.880]  Reitbart world economy at a very dangerous juncture IMF chief and just
[01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:07.840]  last Friday she said this could be a repeat of the 1930s for those that don't
[01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:11.760]  know what that means that means global depression
[01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:41.680]  but back then it was a whole totally different scenario than we have now I mean they let things collapse back then and money retained value the dollar two things in the Great Depression never were questioned and number one thing in the Great Depression was the US dollar now that a lot of people are afraid the year old going to collapse they're going to run back in the dollar and gold coming down some but the dollar was never in question the other second thing was the credit rating of the United States was never in question and both those things have come into question
[01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:57.680]  the veracity of the dollar as it's declining also our credit rating has been cut even though it's only been you know what one great it's still we no longer have the top credit rating they're threatening to cut the credit rating of France threatening to cut their credit rating of the UK
[01:14:57.680 --> 01:15:25.680]  all this is about the bankers making crazy reckless and I think in some cases fraudulent loans and bets and they don't want to take a hit they don't want to take a loss they want to kick the can down the road tink tink tink and they want to they want to you know it's still all this austerity and they want people to pay them back their money and they don't want to take loss my goodness they want another bonus this year because after all they have to pay to raise the money
[01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:45.680]  because after all they have to pay to retain that talent you know the talent that almost destroyed the entire world economy and we still know we're out of this and that's the thing that the mainstream media just really doesn't report on it and that's one of my specialties is what does the mainstream media tell people and they don't really lie and you probably have written into this
[01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:57.680]  they don't really lie I don't want to say that what they do is they just simply don't cover it they simply ignore it now they lie by omission or by omission or they bury it in the article or they spin it
[01:15:57.680 --> 01:16:18.680]  I just did a story with the USA Today newspaper I used to work for a Genet and it was just a few days ago and I called it you know oblivious because of the mainstream media and people are completely and totally in the dark and basically they're I was reading the story on USA Today this is last week
[01:16:18.680 --> 01:16:31.680]  and basically I read the story I said well this isn't really a fair and balanced you know this isn't a objective news story about the economy they ought to write a bad piece on this because you know here they are talking about the economy
[01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:45.680]  and listen their facts they use yes car sales are up yes the home sales are up but they're in reference their bottom bouncing from being off 75% so they're just bouncing along the bottom and this is with and home prices are falling
[01:16:45.680 --> 01:17:04.680]  and this is with the government suppressing interest rates to unbelievable lows down to around 4% and but anyway so real estate's a huge factor in the trouble the economy is in I mean we've got this foreclosure fraud they called it you know Robo shiny was nothing more than basically creating fraudulent documents
[01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:21.680]  so banks go into court and take back houses that they should never loan money on in the first place but listen a really track story came out and more than 4 million foreclosures are now in the pipeline and so they're doing a story about the overall economy
[01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:38.680]  it's not a word about the 4 million foreclosures in the pipeline they're actually saying wow real estate could actually contribute to the economy in 2012 really with 4 million foreclosures more than 4 million foreclosures in the pipeline according to realty track
[01:17:38.680 --> 01:17:58.680]  so it's unbelievable the amount of omission that they have I mean you're right they wrote this so their advertisers in the newspaper will feel good about the Christmas season and hey you know you guys it this is what it is in my conjecture hey you guys at the USA today hey you know we're trying to sell things here don't come out with a negative article two weeks before go week before Christmas
[01:17:58.680 --> 01:18:13.680]  exactly and then they're using the irrational exuberance in the smoke screen to continue down the same derivatives path the bailouts the banks have been given they're only using to leverage it even more so it's going to make things worse it's not like we're saying let's be negative
[01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:33.680]  but meanwhile I've confirmed and obviously you see it all over the news now but they are getting the military ready to be on the streets of America obviously the system knows there's going to be a total collapse and it's going to be 100 times worse when the general public has no idea this is coming I mean if we had the incredible
[01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:49.680]  losses in the Great Depression with people that were pretty much self-sufficient what's going to happen when let's face it a lot of spoiled rotten people I mean this is scary this is scary well and I think what's going to happen with these and I give the longest time I was like oh come on see my
[01:18:49.680 --> 01:19:07.680]  Well you know I hate to say this but these people have to be as smart as me I don't have any great degrees in accounting I'm not an economist I'm an investigative reporter by trade the trade I've learned and I applied my investigative reporting skills to the economy
[01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:22.680]  and basically what I do is I look at what's out there and go what can I prove what can I nail what can I put out there and prove and there's so much out there Alex by the numbers that you can prove from very good sources that say you know we have $12 trillion
[01:19:22.680 --> 01:19:42.680]  $12 trillion liquid dollar assets held outside the country according to John Williams an economist at ShadowsTest.com I think you know he is now can you imagine what kind of debacle could happen if people all of a sudden wake up and realize that the people around the globe are selling these
[01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:58.680]  $12 trillion liquid dollar assets do you understand what kind of calamity and inflation? Yeah let's talk about that exactly we are sitting on top of powder keg and the fuse is lit and it's only a matter of time I just got chills we'll be right back I am getting chills every second

[01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:40.680]  years ago I didn't witness Marines training to take on US militias but I shot video of it it's not my word it's in police state 2000 but I knew it was long term then they were just beta testing I've got family in the military they say everybody officers you name it is being trained for crowd control the last three years so they're
[01:24:40.680 --> 01:24:55.680]  gearing up and now I just read the documents on the Department of Defense site and FEMA and that business of federal filing site where you file for contracts on three sites that the caller pointed out where it talks about the military manning FEMA camps
[01:24:55.680 --> 01:25:09.680]  and blue force situation command and control against Red Force here in America now folks that is military wage and war against the American people I'm sorry Greg Hunter you were making a point about an investigative journalist looking at all these pieces please continue
[01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:22.680]  well listen I only try I'm like you Alex I don't want to be sensational where we did stories at ABC and CNN people would come to us and say hey I've got this story and it's about such a touch and I would say you know what I believe you how do I prove it
[01:25:22.680 --> 01:25:32.680]  how do I prove that amount of cars are killing people or how do I prove that depleted uranium is so terrible and how do I prove that and if I could prove it I could do it so how do I do what I can prove
[01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:46.680]  let's go back to the banking system and here's why if you take a look at the big picture people don't realize everybody thinks 2008 we were saved we were not saved we were postponed they spent 16 trillion dollars according to a government accountability report
[01:25:46.680 --> 01:26:01.680]  thank you Bernie Sanders first flipping that into the bill last year so we could audit the Federal Reserve what they did 16 trillion you heard about the more than 7 trillion given to the banks but 16 trillion anybody report on that in the mainstream media
[01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:16.680]  no that's not a story I have friends of mine still in the mainstream media and I say that's not a story that's a government accountability report that's not something filed by some guy in Montana living in some cave this is the GAO and it was put into a bill
[01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:29.680]  by a US sitting US Senator from Vermont and we found out they spent or doled out 16 trillion dollars in the wake of this and we still have a problem and you know Alex why I think we still have a problem
[01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:33.680]  because they're not using the money to fix the problem that's too big to ever fix
[01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:46.680]  it's too big not enough money and I wrote a piece when I first went on my site had been on you had even been on for 10-15 years but I've only been on for a couple years and one of my first pieces was default option and I said we should just take the banks to
[01:26:46.680 --> 01:27:02.680]  the bank to receive a ship everybody but it was Ron Paul said that it's impossible to pay off a black hole we should take the banks to receive a ship we should protect only the depositors we should the bondholders sorry you get some the shareholders you proved you made a bad investment
[01:27:02.680 --> 01:27:12.680]  depositors that's your capital base that's capital formation it would only cost us 6 trillion dollars 6 trillion we could insured everything in the banks
[01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:31.680]  and I said we've got to pay off the banks for their gambling and they as you said you hit the key they want it all they're going to keep getting bailouts they run the government and they've got the military in Europe standing by and here the military now works for the big mega banks to squeeze it out of us
[01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:51.680]  better you know this is how serious the problem is that most people in the mainstream media watch you know CNBC and some of the stuff they do like I quote something from CNBC about really track okay some of the stuff they do is good it's good actually information but again you know they basically omit they lie by omission how do you omit when you're doing analysis of a bank
[01:27:51.680 --> 01:28:07.680]  okay and I'm not an economist and I don't analyze banks but how do you analyze a bank that's allowed to lie this problem is so big they change the accounting standards the financial accounting standards board the ASB standards in April of 2009 you can change it
[01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:22.680]  they can value these tier 3 assets you know real estate mortgage backed securities that whatever they think they'll get for them in the future now you think about that wow we think we'll get par values for the houses we have in these securities that weren't bought by the Federal Reserve
[01:28:22.680 --> 01:28:42.680]  and any money we bring in let's pay ourselves a bonus and that's what's going on so this problem was so big they couldn't just pump out 16 trillion no they got to allow them and also corporate America you know it's the banks that mostly get this financial accounting standards board treatment where they can value their these assets these toxic assets
[01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:54.680]  whatever they think they get for them in the future as long as they're not bought by the Fed and the taxpayers however so if they're allowed to do that must be an awful big problem and also corporate America they say oh corporate America's flush with cash
[01:28:54.680 --> 01:29:15.680]  well you know not according to the former budget director who says that corporate America under the Reagan administration that corporate America has about 11 trillion in debt so corporate America isn't doing so hot but the banks definitely are not doing David Stockman the banks definitely are not doing hot at all
[01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:20.680]  and you know General Electric was bailed out they should have taken that company down to a dollar
[01:29:20.680 --> 01:29:31.680]  well Greg Hunter long segment coming up I want to pop in with the lady who gave us the documents pointed them out to us and I'm going to try to get her on the show tonight

[01:33:32.680 --> 01:33:42.680]  go to department of defense bid process site and you can see where not only is KBR getting contracts to man the camps
[01:33:42.680 --> 01:33:50.680]  we got those documents from state employees but they are saying that the military is involved
[01:33:50.680 --> 01:33:54.680]  and that it's blue force versus the red force to command and control
[01:33:54.680 --> 01:33:57.680]  and I've been to urban warfare drills I'm like how do you know that
[01:33:57.680 --> 01:34:01.680]  and then Angie off air told me some things but I'm just going to leave it that and see what she wants to say
[01:34:01.680 --> 01:34:05.680]  obviously we'll give her anonymity so she doesn't have to worry too much
[01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:11.680]  but now you've got here's the headlines marshal law attempt in Louisiana echoes Ron Paul's warning
[01:34:11.680 --> 01:34:16.680]  Louisiana state officials call for troops on the streets in war against guns and drugs
[01:34:16.680 --> 01:34:25.680]  I've got in Illinois I've got NBCN AP are saying yeah we want troops on the streets so that's a new talking point
[01:34:25.680 --> 01:34:28.680]  but it's always going to be in the bad neighborhoods first ahead of this
[01:34:28.680 --> 01:34:33.680]  and we're going back to investigative journalist Greg Hunter we're not going to spend a lot of time
[01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:40.680]  with the caller in fact my phone system just crashed John
[01:34:40.680 --> 01:34:45.680]  but we're going to spend a few minutes with Angie and then I'm going to work on getting her on the TV show tonight
[01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:51.680]  and maybe even her husband because again this stuff's all public but you'd have to know where to go look
[01:34:51.680 --> 01:34:58.680]  where they're doing all this it was Wall Street Journal in 2006 about the $386 million to establish
[01:34:58.680 --> 01:35:04.680]  through Halliburton three one million person camps but now they admit hey we're going to use the Department of Defense
[01:35:04.680 --> 01:35:10.680]  against citizens hey we've got the emergency centers establishment act for economic collapse
[01:35:10.680 --> 01:35:17.680]  and now it's pretty much admitted it's just what are the details of it super creepy creepy Greg
[01:35:17.680 --> 01:35:22.680]  and you keep going back to economic collapse obviously if they know it's all going to collapse
[01:35:22.680 --> 01:35:27.680]  I guess they think they're just going to put the homeless people and the dissenters in these facilities
[01:35:27.680 --> 01:35:30.680]  or I mean what do you see as an investigative journalist
[01:35:30.680 --> 01:35:36.680]  well by the numbers if we lose our currency so we have this 12 trillion in liquid dollar assets
[01:35:36.680 --> 01:35:41.680]  it's Treasury bonds that's dollars but Treasury bonds are really nothing more than you pay somebody a dollar today
[01:35:41.680 --> 01:35:45.680]  and in five years or three years or ten years or thirty years you get some more dollars back
[01:35:45.680 --> 01:35:49.680]  and hopefully the interest rate will make up for the dollars you gave and you'll actually have a profit
[01:35:49.680 --> 01:35:54.680]  I don't see how paying somebody two or three percent or four percent over five or ten years
[01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:59.680]  you're ever going to be able to get your money back in terms of real buying power the buying power of your money back
[01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:06.680]  so a lot of countries on the planet you know know this and if we do have a dollar route
[01:36:06.680 --> 01:36:13.680]  in other words if we do have a sell of you know let's say it's not the debit isn't sell all 12 trillion
[01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:19.680]  let's say they sell two or three trillion that could cause interest rates to spike anybody with an adjustable rate mortgage
[01:36:19.680 --> 01:36:24.680]  that could cause you know inflation we might be paying ten dollars a gallon for a gallon of gas
[01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:30.680]  that's the kind of things that can happen if we have a change of currency and I believe ultimately this will all come down
[01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:37.680]  to a currency crisis and that they'll have a bank holiday when they do have a bank holiday as they have in the past
[01:36:37.680 --> 01:36:41.680]  they do value your currency and you'll just have a lot less money to spend
[01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:44.680]  by the way let me stop you I have another headline here
[01:36:44.680 --> 01:36:48.680]  US asks banks to keep more cash on hand
[01:36:48.680 --> 01:36:55.680]  yes that's an AP and AFP so there it is and they say more people are coming in wanting their money
[01:36:55.680 --> 01:37:02.680]  well yes and you know let me tell you Martin Armstrong the famous economist that was held for years for
[01:37:02.680 --> 01:37:10.680]  contempt of court which is outrageous but still he is a renowned brilliant economist that came up with this
[01:37:10.680 --> 01:37:17.680]  economic confidence model which is really the theory of cycles and it's the theory of economic cycles give way to
[01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:24.680]  political cycles you know we had a depression in the 30s you know we had hyperinflation in the 20s for Germany
[01:37:24.680 --> 01:37:30.680]  we had depression in the 30s and Hitler came to power in the 30s so an economic cycle for example gave way to a
[01:37:30.680 --> 01:37:37.680]  political cycle and he has he's out of jail now for his contempt and he was held for five or seven years
[01:37:37.680 --> 01:37:39.680]  for contempt I'm not an expert on his case but
[01:37:39.680 --> 01:37:47.680]  talk about a police day he was totally he was wrongly confused and convicted or wrongly accused of a crime
[01:37:47.680 --> 01:37:51.680]  he did plead guilty to one crime he thought he was going to get out anyway long and short of it
[01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:56.680]  Martin Armstrong the brilliant economist who I believe he just gave a seminar in Philadelphia
[01:37:56.680 --> 01:38:00.680]  and you know people fly in from all over the world people with real money you know it was like I don't know
[01:38:00.680 --> 01:38:05.680]  $4,500 or $5,000 to attend or whatever which is nothing to people with money and he says you know when I have people
[01:38:05.680 --> 01:38:10.680]  fly in it's kind of like the United Nations you know I have people come over from really around the globe
[01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:17.680]  he's going to have some more of these conferences where you talk about you know macro, global, economic things
[01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:23.680]  and even Martin Armstrong says hey listen without real reform the system is going to blow up
[01:38:23.680 --> 01:38:29.680]  the world is going to blow up the world economy he says you know the number one question was at this conference
[01:38:29.680 --> 01:38:36.680]  of all these people the number one question according to him a recent interview was is my money safe in America
[01:38:36.680 --> 01:38:42.680]  and he says listen I got to tell you with this mf global thing I got to say no I don't have good confidence
[01:38:42.680 --> 01:38:48.680]  that anybody's money is safe in America because basically they just win this is according to Martin Armstrong
[01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:53.680]  now this is a source a real source not my just my I don't think money is safe in America this is a guy that
[01:38:53.680 --> 01:38:59.680]  that councils, governments and Congress he's been called to Congress on more than one occasion
[01:38:59.680 --> 01:39:04.680]  you may not seem you know testifying in front of the House of Financial Committee but they've had him up there
[01:39:04.680 --> 01:39:11.680]  and he says that you know with what's going on your money is not safe in America with the whole mf global debacle
[01:39:11.680 --> 01:39:17.680]  so that's a problem also Ann Barnhart you remember her shut her brokerage down
[01:39:17.680 --> 01:39:24.680]  because she said hey in good faith because these trades can't settle I can't tell my clients that I had their money is safe
[01:39:24.680 --> 01:39:30.680]  hey hey they've had a bunch of other heads Soros gave the money up a few months ago and said I'm not taking your money
[01:39:30.680 --> 01:39:36.680]  and they've had a bunch of others do it in the last six months yes and why why is that because systemic failure
[01:39:36.680 --> 01:39:42.680]  could lock everybody's money up they're talking about a credit freeze you know over in Europe which is totally a misnomer
[01:39:42.680 --> 01:39:50.680]  they're not fighting a credit freeze they're not fighting a credit crisis the banks are insolvent
[01:39:50.680 --> 01:39:54.680]  I was guest hosting on a radio show and they had this Wall Street Journal reporter a couple of months ago
[01:39:54.680 --> 01:39:59.680]  and he was over there talking about the European banks and I said hey listen I got this quote from CNN
[01:39:59.680 --> 01:40:06.680]  buried in a story on CNN and I mean it's all my sight Meredith Whitney you know Star Banking Analyst Meredith Whitney
[01:40:06.680 --> 01:40:13.680]  was sitting there talking with Poppy Harlow I believe her name is and she says well you know Meredith Whitney says
[01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:19.680]  well you know they can't bail out all the banks there's going to be bank failures because you know governments can't bail them all out
[01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:24.680]  well they're going to have to print tons of money A to bail out the winners the ones they want to pick
[01:40:24.680 --> 01:40:31.680]  B why is that story not being reported and I asked this Wall Street Journal reporter over there and you know reporting on this
[01:40:31.680 --> 01:40:38.680]  as a guest I said why isn't the fact that we are going to see banking failures why are you not reporting that
[01:40:38.680 --> 01:40:46.680]  oh this is the reporter I want to name him oh well even at the Wall Street Journal you know they're told to tone it down
[01:40:46.680 --> 01:40:51.680]  not to cause a panic you know hey don't say that you know here this looked out from Meredith Whitney
[01:40:51.680 --> 01:40:59.680]  you didn't see 60 minutes having her back on about hey there's going to be banking failures in Europe and there are going to be bank failures
[01:40:59.680 --> 01:41:05.680]  look at Ron Paul he's he's been warning about this and they call him a fearmonger and a crazy person
[01:41:05.680 --> 01:41:13.680]  oh no no no by the numbers listen the banks are insolvent it's such a big problem that not only in America did the financial accounting standard
[01:41:13.680 --> 01:41:19.680]  supports FASB changed the rules for what you're asking so that's how insolvent the system is the people don't realize it
[01:41:19.680 --> 01:41:26.680]  they changed the accounting rules because they couldn't print it but what does the system think because if
[01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:32.680]  I remember one of this callers because I want to tell us more about this huge military news
[01:41:32.680 --> 01:41:36.680]  Corzine runs off with a billion two hundred million conservatively
[01:41:36.680 --> 01:41:42.680]  what actually himself but it's disappeared yeah it's disappeared
[01:41:42.680 --> 01:41:48.680]  it's disappeared but but then as you know they got no attention except the financial times of London did do a blurb
[01:41:48.680 --> 01:41:53.680]  the head of the CME group you know the for those that don't know the big commodities group above it
[01:41:53.680 --> 01:42:01.680]  he'll exchange yeah he came out and said sorry we were in meetings with them they took the money out he gave the order
[01:42:01.680 --> 01:42:10.680]  so there's Corzine at the $75 million yes yeah yeah totally caught right there and no one gets in trouble
[01:42:10.680 --> 01:42:15.680]  I mean obviously Corzine's up there lying he's the CEO it doesn't know where it got wired to
[01:42:15.680 --> 01:42:20.680]  well I wrote a piece and I tell you what if I have to look that stupid to save my bacon
[01:42:20.680 --> 01:42:26.680]  I mean here you have a guy who was a former governor of the state of New Jersey a former U.S.
[01:42:26.680 --> 01:42:33.680]  Senator and a co-chair a co-CEO of Goldman Sachs and he doesn't know anything going on
[01:42:33.680 --> 01:42:39.680]  and the two guys within the COO and CFO also say they don't know what's going on
[01:42:39.680 --> 01:42:43.680]  I called it I said the three students testified in front of Congress I mean the only thing they were missing
[01:42:43.680 --> 01:42:47.680]  was a mouse laughing Larry and currently for the dumb answers they were giving
[01:42:47.680 --> 01:42:53.680]  so why do you think they're getting so bold and reckless I mean I think we're back to the insolvency problem
[01:42:53.680 --> 01:42:57.680]  over in Europe and of course they're adding more debt to tackle this problem
[01:42:57.680 --> 01:43:02.680]  so it's like past the hand grenade it's like it's like past the hand grenade they pulled the pen out
[01:43:02.680 --> 01:43:08.680]  they just passed the bad debt around well yes and we're talking about Dan Barnhart the woman that shut her business down
[01:43:08.680 --> 01:43:15.680]  says hey listen you need a hundred trillion dollars to bail out Europe at least and you know what they came out in the
[01:43:15.680 --> 01:43:20.680]  Davos Switzerland thing in January they said we want a hundred trillion that was how much did they need a hundred trillion
[01:43:20.680 --> 01:43:25.680]  you tell me how they're going to pay they're going to handle this insolvency crisis with the banks
[01:43:25.680 --> 01:43:32.680]  with five hundred six hundred a trillion two trillion dollars over in Europe it's a insolvency crisis
[01:43:32.680 --> 01:43:37.680]  they are insolvent and let me tell you what I did get out of this reporter from the Wall Street Journal
[01:43:37.680 --> 01:43:41.680]  is as well they've changed the rules about sovereign debt and yes you too can hold that
[01:43:41.680 --> 01:43:46.680]  you know you can hold Greek bonds that are what thirty cents on the dollar fifty cents on the dollar
[01:43:46.680 --> 01:43:51.680]  they wanted to take a fifty percent haircut you can hold Greek bonds at par
[01:43:51.680 --> 01:43:57.680]  makes your bottom line look really good that's like you saying hey I've got ten ounces of gold
[01:43:57.680 --> 01:44:03.680]  but I'm going to hold it on my books not at sixteen hundred and forty dollars or whatever it is right now thirty dollars an ounce
[01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:07.680]  I'm going to hold it on my books and what I think I'd get for it in the year twenty twenty four
[01:44:07.680 --> 01:44:12.680]  I think it's worth ten thousand an ounce I've got a hundred thousand dollars let's leverage that up
[01:44:12.680 --> 01:44:17.680]  let's pay some bonuses let's go buy a car that's what's going on with the accounting
[01:44:17.680 --> 01:44:22.680]  they are allowed to hold these toxic assets that they're toxic because what the Fed bought
[01:44:22.680 --> 01:44:26.680]  at least a couple of trillion dollars because they weren't really good and you think about it
[01:44:26.680 --> 01:44:31.680]  Alex I want you to back up and do a wide shot and I'm going to tell you something really simple
[01:44:31.680 --> 01:44:37.680]  and it's going to be like oh you had the Robo-signing remember that Robo-signing remember that
[01:44:37.680 --> 01:44:38.680]  yes I did
[01:44:38.680 --> 01:44:46.680]  ok so now we know it's widely reported that millions of documents were forged with people like Linda Green
[01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:50.680]  we're talking about promissory notes and you think you pay for your house after thirty years
[01:44:50.680 --> 01:44:59.680]  no you don't you pay it when you sign a promissory note that's a financial instrument much like a federal reserve note
[01:44:59.680 --> 01:45:03.680]  you can't go counterfeit a federal reserve note good out of seven eleven to buy a slurpee can you
[01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:04.680]  no
[01:45:04.680 --> 01:45:11.680]  you can't counterfeit a promissory note either so now if we know that millions of good you like this
[01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:18.680]  so we know millions of documents were forged widely reported story then riddle me this
[01:45:18.680 --> 01:45:24.680]  how did they create mortgage-backed securities when they didn't have the documents
[01:45:24.680 --> 01:45:31.680]  obviously they have to forge them how did they bundle the securities well they do
[01:45:31.680 --> 01:45:38.680]  how did they rate the securities if you have to forge the documents how did you rate the securities
[01:45:38.680 --> 01:45:43.680]  number number three how did you get a tax advantage if they weren't really securities
[01:45:43.680 --> 01:45:49.680]  how did you get a tax advantage so the income goes straight through to the bond holder to the pension fund
[01:45:49.680 --> 01:45:57.680]  to whoever's called a rivick how did that happen and finally if you know there is major fraudulent activities
[01:45:57.680 --> 01:46:04.680]  as Alan Grayson said and many other people that said it was fraudulent why isn't the justice department filing charges
[01:46:04.680 --> 01:46:09.680]  they're busy shipping guns into Mexico they created the mirror system to fraudulently claim that they owned the houses
[01:46:09.680 --> 01:46:16.680]  and had the deeds and they AAA rated the bonds and had corrupt companies certified as AAA rating
[01:46:16.680 --> 01:46:22.680]  which they then sold those insurance policies as more crud so they sold crap on top of crap
[01:46:22.680 --> 01:46:28.680]  suddenly nobody's getting arrested according to William Black the renowned economist
[01:46:28.680 --> 01:46:33.680]  professor of economies got PhD in law
[01:46:33.680 --> 01:46:37.680]  he was the big guy that sent a bunch of them to prison last go around
[01:46:37.680 --> 01:46:43.680]  well yeah they put a thousand financial elites in prison this is 70 times bigger according to him
[01:46:43.680 --> 01:46:50.680]  zero financial elites have gone to jail we've heard they're going to civil charges against the executives of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
[01:46:50.680 --> 01:46:56.680]  Greg Hunter don't worry Northcom standing by to take out the evil people that are criticizing
[01:46:56.680 --> 01:47:00.680]  and I want to briefly we're going to go to break come back and have you finish riveting information
[01:47:00.680 --> 01:47:05.680]  hope folks are waking up out there and spreading the word Angie in North Carolina
[01:47:05.680 --> 01:47:10.680]  I don't know how much you want to say what you told me off air but you have reasons to notice these things in the
[01:47:10.680 --> 01:47:17.680]  defense orders but how big an issue just just you know to our guests breaking it down to talk about the military
[01:47:17.680 --> 01:47:24.680]  running emergency camps well you could say it's for floods and things this is blue force situational awareness
[01:47:24.680 --> 01:47:31.680]  communication and you're absolutely right when they talk about blue force versus red force that means a combat situation
[01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:38.680]  Angie finish up your points on that yeah I think it's very disturbing this whole entire document
[01:47:38.680 --> 01:47:47.680]  is their bid to contract for the establishment of a communications system for the purpose of
[01:47:47.680 --> 01:47:54.680]  essentially a complete societal breakdown continuity of government situation and that's exactly what it says that
[01:47:54.680 --> 01:48:02.680]  the operations division needs to provide the you know basically the electronics communication and look at outreach support
[01:48:02.680 --> 01:48:08.680]  that's going to be psyops and then in there it talks about red force and again I've been to the drills that means
[01:48:08.680 --> 01:48:14.680]  waging when they go red blue or blue red when it talks about blue force that's that's the government against somebody
[01:48:14.680 --> 01:48:21.680]  right it's actually it says blue force situational awareness and I'll say it again for those that don't know what that is
[01:48:21.680 --> 01:48:29.680]  it's it's the communication system that the military uses its military program to identify
[01:48:29.680 --> 01:48:34.680]  friendlies and non-friendlies in the battlefield for the purpose of avoiding friendly fire
[01:48:34.680 --> 01:48:40.680]  so you know generally it's a transponder unless they think the enemy is tracking them then they turn them off
[01:48:40.680 --> 01:48:46.680]  or it's what's painted on the tanks it's codes that are blurped down and anybody else who isn't you know on the blue list
[01:48:46.680 --> 01:48:53.680]  you're on the red list right or or they can use other colors but usually it's a blue red I mean this is amazing
[01:48:53.680 --> 01:49:00.680]  and I mean you know about it I mean one of the people you know they're involved in this are they pretty upset right now
[01:49:00.680 --> 01:49:08.680]  yeah very it's an extremely disturbing development you know basically anything that that would provide for
[01:49:08.680 --> 01:49:17.680]  you know a 72 hour standby in order for them to be able to pull together you know situational control within the
[01:49:17.680 --> 01:49:24.680]  borders of the United States using the military is disturbing you know that's why we have
[01:49:24.680 --> 01:49:32.680]  Well we don't need more they just passed in DAA now I mean sure it's outrageous but wait we found a C-SPAN clip
[01:49:32.680 --> 01:49:37.680]  it's in like a two hour long shows we didn't play it on the radio we found at the start but we're going to try to play it tonight
[01:49:37.680 --> 01:49:43.680]  where they're on C-SPAN going look we're not just going to arrest you we're going to kill you and they say yes we're going to
[01:49:43.680 --> 01:49:49.680]  we're going to kill Americans without a trial I mean just the magnitude of this
[01:49:49.680 --> 01:49:56.680]  Well that's what's so disturbing and as you were saying before with the blue force red force the way that that works is
[01:49:56.680 --> 01:50:05.680]  you're right blue force has blue force is considered friendly and they carry transponders and essentially anybody that does not
[01:50:05.680 --> 01:50:13.680]  have a transponder that identifies them as a friendly is considered a red force or enemy
[01:50:13.680 --> 01:50:20.680]  and that's what they use out in the battlefield now I don't know why they would want to set up a system to be able to use that
[01:50:20.680 --> 01:50:24.680]  here within the United States unless they know something that we don't
[01:50:24.680 --> 01:50:29.680]  Well look I was told by insiders and now of course the drones are actually tracking farmers so people believe it now
[01:50:29.680 --> 01:50:35.680]  that they got the GPS marking of your door or SWAT teams army truck pickups and drone attacks
[01:50:35.680 --> 01:50:41.680]  and I was told this by an army colonel who was so scared he wanted I'm not going to get into it
[01:50:41.680 --> 01:50:47.680]  listen I'm going to put you on hold again I'm going to have Rob do call you I want to interview you on the TV tonight

[01:55:43.960 --> 01:55:47.400]  are what why aren't they telling us national association of realtor see
[01:55:47.400 --> 01:55:51.160]  if anybody covers this tonight this came out today the n a r national
[01:55:51.160 --> 01:55:54.760]  association of real owners is according to john williams who is a ivy lee
[01:55:54.760 --> 01:55:58.600]  trained economist who sells his information to hedge funds and nobody in
[01:55:58.600 --> 01:56:02.360]  the world would ever make a decision based on government unemployment
[01:56:02.360 --> 01:56:06.840]  government inflation uh government gdp numbers they hire people like john
[01:56:06.840 --> 01:56:10.600]  williams they okay here's the raw data what does it really mean and that's why
[01:56:10.600 --> 01:56:14.760]  john williams shadow stats dot com does what he does for people who handle
[01:56:14.760 --> 01:56:17.960]  money well he does it the old way the government used to that's correct i mean
[01:56:17.960 --> 01:56:21.960]  when he says inflation is 11 percent if he did it the way it was done by the
[01:56:21.960 --> 01:56:26.760]  bureau of labor statistics and in 1980 or unemployment's really 22
[01:56:26.760 --> 01:56:31.240]  employment's really 20 22 correct if it was done the way the bureau of labor
[01:56:31.240 --> 01:56:35.160]  statistics did it 1994 or earlier unemployed underemployed
[01:56:35.160 --> 01:56:40.120]  unemployed and underemployed is really 22 percent so if it really we had the
[01:56:40.120 --> 01:56:42.760]  first two quarters of the year we had a couple of percent shrinkage according
[01:56:42.760 --> 01:56:46.440]  to him uh so that's that that's not getting up and here's another story
[01:56:46.440 --> 01:56:48.760]  just as a data point then i'll get back to you other thing the national

[01:57:13.400 --> 01:57:17.640]  vanished since 19 2007 according to the national
[01:57:17.640 --> 01:57:21.720]  association realer's adjustments but back to the mainstream media versus the
[01:57:21.720 --> 01:57:25.480]  real media which is now us we're not the alternative media we're the real media
[01:57:25.480 --> 01:57:28.920]  i don't i know what a story is alex jones i know what one is
[01:57:28.920 --> 01:57:33.160]  i did stories against ford motor company i did stories against big car companies
[01:57:33.160 --> 01:57:37.320]  i did stories about depleted uranium munitions i had to you know i've done

[01:57:40.680 --> 01:57:43.880]  i did nothing i didn't cover fires i didn't cover floods
[01:57:43.880 --> 01:57:49.080]  i worked in the rnd department of abc news and cnn i work with the lawyers i
[01:57:49.080 --> 01:57:52.120]  work with standards i work with legal i didn't say
[01:57:52.120 --> 01:57:55.800]  anything unless i had i said a line like someone so did such and such do you
[01:57:55.800 --> 01:57:59.240]  have a document to prove that i had to have documents for everything i know
[01:57:59.240 --> 01:58:02.520]  what a story is i know what to say and i know what how to say
[01:58:02.520 --> 01:58:05.800]  something that's true and what's going on today is outrageous
[01:58:05.800 --> 01:58:08.840]  but let's say let's take 60 minutes the pinnacle of broadcasting
[01:58:08.840 --> 01:58:12.280]  they interview uh and i did this on my site they interview
[01:58:12.280 --> 01:58:15.480]  ben Bernanke uh what you know several months ago
[01:58:15.480 --> 01:58:19.960]  and he says oh we're not printing money uh and you know how i know he's lying
[01:58:19.960 --> 01:58:24.680]  because uh john steward on the daily show found a clip where he was on 60
[01:58:24.680 --> 01:58:28.520]  minutes a year earlier and he says essentially we're printing money
[01:58:28.520 --> 01:58:31.720]  and 60 minutes decided not to ask him about any of that
[01:58:31.720 --> 01:58:37.160]  i tell you what greg hundred let's do five minutes overdrive back in 60 seconds i want you to finish

[01:58:48.280 --> 01:58:52.840]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[01:58:52.840 --> 01:58:56.760]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[01:58:56.760 --> 01:59:00.200]  bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[01:59:00.200 --> 01:59:02.920]  much power your electric company allows you to have
[01:59:02.920 --> 01:59:05.800]  it's true total government control of electricity
[01:59:05.800 --> 01:59:08.520]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[01:59:08.520 --> 01:59:12.920]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[01:59:12.920 --> 01:59:16.840]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[01:59:16.840 --> 01:59:20.440]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[01:59:20.440 --> 01:59:24.120]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages
[01:59:24.120 --> 01:59:28.200]  number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and
[01:59:28.200 --> 01:59:31.560]  peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by
[01:59:31.560 --> 01:59:34.840]  solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more

[02:00:49.400 --> 02:00:53.240]  hi alex i'm a first-time caller i just wanted to share a
[02:00:53.240 --> 02:00:58.440]  cool experience that i had in 2008 and i was uh
[02:00:58.440 --> 02:01:02.520]  what i saw was something that led me to believe that there are
[02:01:02.520 --> 02:01:06.440]  either fema camps or detention facilities near my home
[02:01:06.440 --> 02:01:11.000]  i was driving down university avenue in proba utah and as i was driving
[02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:14.920]  by a rail yard there were two pilot cars that uh pulled out
[02:01:14.920 --> 02:01:19.080]  into the street and stopped traffic and uh as i watched they
[02:01:19.080 --> 02:01:22.760]  they were followed by some uh semi-traders that were loaded with
[02:01:22.760 --> 02:01:29.240]  these concrete boxes and uh i uh naturally quite curious so
[02:01:29.240 --> 02:01:32.760]  i followed these semi-traders to see what they might be hauling
[02:01:32.760 --> 02:01:37.400]  and uh with the pole on both sides of the uh the trailers
[02:01:37.400 --> 02:01:41.880]  and looked really close and it looked to me like large concrete boxes
[02:01:41.880 --> 02:01:46.680]  each had two steel doors and they had barred windows
[02:01:46.680 --> 02:01:51.400]  and yeah no no no no sir they have those for the last decade the government's
[02:01:51.400 --> 02:01:55.800]  been building them as fast as they can and that's exactly
[02:01:55.800 --> 02:01:59.640]  what they have on these general camps and they have areas where they lock you up
[02:01:59.640 --> 02:02:04.120]  they've been photographed many times they're like old-fashioned jails
[02:02:04.120 --> 02:02:10.680]  and uh this is for just setting up prisons very very quickly
[02:02:10.680 --> 02:02:14.600]  yeah it was it was extremely frightening but see denial set in after i saw
[02:02:14.600 --> 02:02:17.640]  this and i and i totally put it aside until
[02:02:17.640 --> 02:02:22.200]  one day you know less than a year later i was on youtube and i noticed a video
[02:02:22.200 --> 02:02:26.360]  of the exact same thing that i saw somebody else in my area took photos of
[02:02:26.360 --> 02:02:29.480]  this because they were being unloaded and loaded onto the trailers
[02:02:29.480 --> 02:02:34.520]  yeah i forget what you call them a mobile mobile jails concrete jails
[02:02:34.520 --> 02:02:37.960]  they've been photographed and videoed all over the country
[02:02:37.960 --> 02:02:41.160]  and they are at some of these decommissioned bases
[02:02:41.160 --> 02:02:43.960]  but none of this is rumors now they admit they're hiring the internment
[02:02:43.960 --> 02:02:46.600]  specialist they've built the camps now they're moving
[02:02:46.600 --> 02:02:50.440]  to have groups on standby to man them that this is all official
[02:02:50.440 --> 02:02:54.200]  and the mainstream media will not touch it because they are complicit just like
[02:02:54.200 --> 02:02:58.280]  they won't say corezines a crook they are complicit in the organized crime
[02:02:58.280 --> 02:03:02.120]  takeover of america but there's still a lot of free speech there's still a lot
[02:03:02.120 --> 02:03:06.120]  of good people in the country and folks are waking up
[02:03:06.120 --> 02:03:09.960]  yeah if the viewers will type in portable prisons in utah
[02:03:09.960 --> 02:03:13.160]  what i saw will pop up and you can see the yeah you guys type in portable
[02:03:13.160 --> 02:03:15.560]  prisons utah for me please we'll put that on screen
[02:03:15.560 --> 02:03:18.520]  yeah if you're a prison planet dot db viewer you'll be able to see this but
[02:03:18.520 --> 02:03:22.920]  everybody else yeah portable prisons utah i've seen it all over the country
[02:03:22.920 --> 02:03:26.440]  in fact uh some of these we know have been loaded on ships and taken
[02:03:26.440 --> 02:03:30.440]  overseas we know they have these uh there was a massacre
[02:03:30.440 --> 02:03:33.720]  less than a year into the afghan invasion where they put in one night
[02:03:33.720 --> 02:03:38.280]  3 000 people in these standing room only and then it's like it's a form of
[02:03:38.280 --> 02:03:42.360]  crucifixion to where you couldn't breathe and you couldn't lay down
[02:03:42.360 --> 02:03:45.880]  and uh it killed them all within three days
[02:03:45.880 --> 02:03:49.400]  do you imagine how painful that is they they cram you in
[02:03:49.400 --> 02:03:52.280]  people don't know what's happening when it's happening they it's a form of
[02:03:52.280 --> 02:03:54.760]  murder i mean it's an old-fashioned form of killing
[02:03:54.760 --> 02:04:00.680]  and they cram you in uh and i see the photo there's even more powerful ones
[02:04:00.680 --> 02:04:03.960]  that show the show the bars i don't even know if that's what those are
[02:04:03.960 --> 02:04:07.960]  uh but it looks like prefab something and
[02:04:07.960 --> 02:04:12.360]  they uh they cram you in standing until it's like the phone booth game
[02:04:12.360 --> 02:04:16.520]  and then they close the door and it's like you're gonna die now
[02:04:16.520 --> 02:04:22.760]  they just walk off and leave and i remember uh it came out with bbc and ap
[02:04:22.760 --> 02:04:26.760]  that when they did this after three days they opened the doors
[02:04:26.760 --> 02:04:30.200]  to create a mass grave and some one guy was alive and ran off and they
[02:04:30.200 --> 02:04:33.880]  machine gunned him but then they had to write a report on it
[02:04:33.880 --> 02:04:40.200]  uh just like pat yeah there's from prisonbladded.com

[02:08:39.960 --> 02:08:44.120]  job uh erin dykes listens to your show has followed a lot of what you've done

[02:09:04.680 --> 02:09:08.600]  uh the issue that the system knows what they're doing
[02:09:08.600 --> 02:09:12.600]  uh i mean a great example is breast cancer
[02:09:12.600 --> 02:09:18.280]  we know what's going on with breast cancer uh we know that they always talk
[02:09:18.280 --> 02:09:21.080]  about hey let's find a cure for it instead of
[02:09:21.080 --> 02:09:25.560]  asking why does the u.s lead the world in it and every other form of cancer
[02:09:25.560 --> 02:09:28.840]  instead of finding out why we're getting cancer they just talk about treating
[02:09:28.840 --> 02:09:32.520]  it once you get it and i think with that statement that opens up the door
[02:09:32.520 --> 02:09:35.960]  to understand the fact that they want to treat the illness they don't want to
[02:09:35.960 --> 02:09:39.720]  stop you from getting the illness well do you ever wonder why uh drug
[02:09:39.720 --> 02:09:43.240]  companies and kentucky fried chicken and and fast food operations
[02:09:43.240 --> 02:09:48.200]  sponsors things like race for the cure and uh the the susan b coman foundation
[02:09:48.200 --> 02:09:51.960]  is sponsored by uh drug companies and sponsored by
[02:09:51.960 --> 02:09:55.960]  uh the people who produce foods and people who produce products that
[02:09:55.960 --> 02:10:01.000]  are linked to breast cancer i mean what's the logic there why would a drug
[02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:05.400]  company that's making drugs to fight breast cancer uh supposedly fight
[02:10:05.400 --> 02:10:07.960]  breast cancer what would be what would be there
[02:10:07.960 --> 02:10:11.000]  why would there what would be their vested interest in keeping breast
[02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:14.200]  cancer in the public consciousness why would they want people to be terrified
[02:10:14.200 --> 02:10:17.640]  of breast cancer why would they want to keep bringing up breast cancer every way
[02:10:17.640 --> 02:10:21.560]  everywhere you turn it's in order to get people paranoid enough
[02:10:21.560 --> 02:10:25.000]  freaked out enough that they participate in the medical model and that's the
[02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:27.480]  problem with breast cancer you don't hear people talking about
[02:10:27.480 --> 02:10:30.520]  to take care of breast cancer changing your essential fatty acids not eating
[02:10:30.520 --> 02:10:33.080]  fast food not eating kentucky fried chicken
[02:10:33.080 --> 02:10:36.520]  not participating in the kinds of things that cause breast cancer they talk
[02:10:36.520 --> 02:10:39.800]  about treating breast cancer they talk about curing breast cancer but they
[02:10:39.800 --> 02:10:43.480]  don't talk about not participating in the things that cause the breast cancer
[02:10:43.480 --> 02:10:46.520]  breast cancer and by running all the different movements and having the
[02:10:46.520 --> 02:10:48.840]  different races and things with well-meaning people
[02:10:48.840 --> 02:10:52.600]  they then control the whole debate about it to make sure that information is
[02:10:52.600 --> 02:10:54.440]  never discovered exactly they act like they're the
[02:10:54.440 --> 02:10:57.800]  knights in shining armor they act like they're the saviors they act like
[02:10:57.800 --> 02:11:00.040]  they're the people who are going to save you from the breast cancer but let's
[02:11:00.040 --> 02:11:03.400]  look at the facts we now anybody can just search this it's a fact
[02:11:03.400 --> 02:11:08.760]  lead the world in cancer of every type including breast cancer
[02:11:08.760 --> 02:11:11.800]  and every industrialized nations that has the vaccines
[02:11:11.800 --> 02:11:16.680]  the gmo the monosodium glutamate that they base this fast food in
[02:11:16.680 --> 02:11:20.600]  that's where you see this going on in places where it's not happening
[02:11:20.600 --> 02:11:25.240]  they have the intensifying longevity that's right breast cancer prostate
[02:11:25.240 --> 02:11:28.120]  cancer these are diseases of lifestyle these are diseases
[02:11:28.120 --> 02:11:31.320]  of the way we participate in our lives they're not inevitable
[02:11:31.320 --> 02:11:35.720]  you don't have to get cancer they're the signs of a dysfunctional culture the
[02:11:35.720 --> 02:11:39.000]  signs of dysfunctional lifestyle choices okay i want to get into all this
[02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:42.840]  with you here today because you're here in studio with us
[02:11:42.840 --> 02:11:47.640]  but before we go any further i'd like you to tell folks about your awakening
[02:11:47.640 --> 02:11:51.080]  where you came from your process you know to now
[02:11:51.080 --> 02:11:54.840]  you know being a leading person out there exposing all this i'm a pharmacist
[02:11:54.840 --> 02:11:58.600]  and let me tell you something pharmacists know how the sausage is made as a
[02:11:58.600 --> 02:12:01.000]  registered pharmacist one of the things that i saw
[02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:04.840]  was that the people who are getting the drugs are the people who can
[02:12:04.840 --> 02:12:09.320]  least stand the drugs old people sick people and young people
[02:12:09.320 --> 02:12:11.560]  those are the people who are taking most of the prescription medicines one of
[02:12:11.560 --> 02:12:13.800]  the things pharmacists study and we study this at length
[02:12:13.800 --> 02:12:17.800]  is side effects we study toxicities we study
[02:12:17.800 --> 02:12:24.520]  we study medicines we study diseases and we study side effects of toxicity
[02:12:24.520 --> 02:12:28.760]  side effects of medications to the extent where one time i watched a movie in
[02:12:28.760 --> 02:12:33.400]  pharmacy school where where the movie was promoting a new
[02:12:33.400 --> 02:12:36.520]  class of medications that was supposed to revolutionize heart disease and the
[02:12:36.520 --> 02:12:39.960]  movie lasted 60 minutes and 15 minutes was about how
[02:12:39.960 --> 02:12:43.560]  wonderful the the new drug was a new class of drugs it was for uh
[02:12:43.560 --> 02:12:46.680]  that was going to combat high blood pressure and the last 45 minutes was
[02:12:46.680 --> 02:12:50.440]  the side effects caused by the medication and when i saw things like
[02:12:50.440 --> 02:12:53.400]  this i realized that wait a minute there's something wrong with this
[02:12:53.400 --> 02:12:57.320]  pharmaceutical model then in pharmacy school we study
[02:12:57.320 --> 02:13:01.640]  diseases as if they were nutritional deficiencies and we study medications as
[02:13:01.640 --> 02:13:04.680]  if are we studying nutrients as if they were medications
[02:13:04.680 --> 02:13:08.600]  so when you combine the fact that on the one hand you have diseases
[02:13:08.600 --> 02:13:12.520]  as the manifestations of nutritional deficiencies and on the other hand
[02:13:12.520 --> 02:13:15.800]  you have medicinal properties to vitamin a and to vitamin c
[02:13:15.800 --> 02:13:19.800]  and to vitamin e it kind of makes sense that why the heck are we using
[02:13:19.800 --> 02:13:23.240]  pharmaceuticals with their side effects when our what we're treating is really
[02:13:23.240 --> 02:13:26.840]  in many cases deficiency states and the medicines
[02:13:26.840 --> 02:13:29.320]  that we could use to treat the deficient deficiency states are
[02:13:29.320 --> 02:13:32.760]  completely non-toxic they're completely side effect free
[02:13:32.760 --> 02:13:37.800]  and they're literally literally the cures to the deficiency diseases by
[02:13:37.800 --> 02:13:40.680]  definition a deficiency disease is cured
[02:13:40.680 --> 02:13:44.520]  by the nutrient that you give to fill up the deficiency
[02:13:44.520 --> 02:13:47.160]  so when i graduated pharmacy school and i saw that people are getting all these
[02:13:47.160 --> 02:13:50.280]  medications were sicker than ever before i combined that with my
[02:13:50.280 --> 02:13:55.000]  pharmacy bar life expectancy is now falling is falling it's like 26th now
[02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:59.240]  if but but let me add if you as you know but i've seen the actuaries on this
[02:13:59.240 --> 02:14:03.640]  up until even the 20s and 30s if you lived past about five
[02:14:03.640 --> 02:14:07.160]  and then you took that infant mortality out because kids did die more often
[02:14:07.160 --> 02:14:11.880]  then if you took the infant mortality out longevity was way
[02:14:11.880 --> 02:14:15.480]  further than it is now i mean this they know exactly what they're doing
[02:14:15.480 --> 02:14:19.160]  even when the when the settlers came to the new world from europe
[02:14:19.160 --> 02:14:23.640]  they had higher life expectancies when they came here from europe when
[02:14:23.640 --> 02:14:27.800]  europe was trashed when the settlers came here in the 1600s and the 1700s
[02:14:27.800 --> 02:14:30.760]  the 1500s european been trashed for almost a thousand years
[02:14:30.760 --> 02:14:34.200]  when they came here to the new world and all of a sudden they had fresh air and
[02:14:34.200 --> 02:14:39.240]  they had wonderful agriculture and they had a great fish and they had
[02:14:39.240 --> 02:14:43.080]  all kinds of game their life expectancy was 75 80 years old and
[02:14:43.080 --> 02:14:46.840]  this is in the 1700s we had higher life
[02:14:46.840 --> 02:14:50.520]  expectancies so the fact of the matter is is that we're not
[02:14:50.520 --> 02:14:55.320]  sick we're starving and what i saw as a pharmacist when i started to dispense
[02:14:55.320 --> 02:14:57.880]  medicaid when i started to dispense nutrients to people who had been on a
[02:14:57.880 --> 02:15:01.240]  medication i saw blood pressure drop i saw weight
[02:15:01.240 --> 02:15:05.400]  drop i saw the markers of diabetes improved using nutritional supplements
[02:15:05.400 --> 02:15:08.440]  and i just put one and one together and i started using nutritional supplements
[02:15:08.440 --> 02:15:10.120]  in my practice and i've been doing it for now
[02:15:10.120 --> 02:15:13.960]  close to 30 years mike adams talks about being a computer program
[02:15:13.960 --> 02:15:18.760]  emmer you know very successful and being really unhealthy
[02:15:18.760 --> 02:15:22.360]  and he got off the fast food and stuff and he got better right away
[02:15:22.360 --> 02:15:26.200]  and then now he's in super good shape and and and incredibly healthy it's not
[02:15:26.200 --> 02:15:29.640]  hard to do but you know what alex people think it's a miracle because we have
[02:15:29.640 --> 02:15:34.120]  been so conditioned to believe that our body's demise is inevitable
[02:15:34.120 --> 02:15:37.240]  we've been so conditioned to believe that oh you're 30 or 35 you're just going
[02:15:37.240 --> 02:15:39.880]  to get arthritis oh you're 30 or 35 you're just going to
[02:15:39.880 --> 02:15:43.240]  have a fatty liver do you know 30 of americans suffer from fatty liver
[02:15:43.240 --> 02:15:46.120]  disease maybe more and if you go to the doctor and he says
[02:15:46.120 --> 02:15:49.480]  oh you got a little fatty liver you know he'll tell you he'll say it's normal
[02:15:49.480 --> 02:15:53.000]  because the medical model says that our demise
[02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:56.760]  is normal and the only thing we can do is stave it off
[02:15:56.760 --> 02:15:59.480]  symptomatic how do you reverse the fatty liver
[02:15:59.480 --> 02:16:02.360]  lots of ways and that's what i'll tell you in a second but that's a great
[02:16:02.360 --> 02:16:06.600]  question because there are so many different ways to reverse these signs
[02:16:06.600 --> 02:16:08.920]  fatty liver i'll just give you a couple good examples
[02:16:08.920 --> 02:16:12.440]  fructose fruit sugar is processed directly by the liver
[02:16:12.440 --> 02:16:16.520]  in the last 30 or 40 years we've gone from zero consumption of high fructose
[02:16:16.520 --> 02:16:20.920]  corn syrup to roughly 60 pounds of high consumption per person
[02:16:20.920 --> 02:16:23.400]  in this country and that doesn't include the fructose that we get from today and
[02:16:23.400 --> 02:16:26.280]  they know it converts differently and converts in the liver
[02:16:26.280 --> 02:16:30.040]  it's and then it blocks key endocrines correct well the liver produces all
[02:16:30.040 --> 02:16:32.920]  kinds of hormones but the point is is that fructose is
[02:16:32.920 --> 02:16:36.280]  processed directly by the liver paleologically we didn't grow up with
[02:16:36.280 --> 02:16:39.880]  fructose the human body grew up in the african savannah there was no fructose
[02:16:39.880 --> 02:16:43.160]  on the african savannah we were lucky if we found a little bit of berries
[02:16:43.160 --> 02:16:46.200]  somewhere that didn't have a lot of sugar in it but what's happened over the
[02:16:46.200 --> 02:16:49.160]  last 60 or 50 or 60 years i think it was in
[02:16:49.160 --> 02:16:51.960]  early 70s when we started to get into a lot of high fructose corn syrup
[02:16:51.960 --> 02:16:55.480]  is our ingestion of this stuff has skyrocketed and look at diabetes and
[02:16:55.480 --> 02:16:58.680]  the body can't handle it it's up several thousand percentage points
[02:16:58.680 --> 02:17:02.280]  absurd and in pharmacy school when i graduated in 1986 they told us this was
[02:17:02.280 --> 02:17:05.240]  going to happen today one out of three americans is
[02:17:05.240 --> 02:17:08.520]  either diabetic or pre-diabetic and instead it was an actuary
[02:17:08.520 --> 02:17:11.880]  of let's go make a bunch of money off this well here's a very important point
[02:17:11.880 --> 02:17:16.840]  alex we treat things at the top of the tree the root is usually in the
[02:17:16.840 --> 02:17:21.080]  digestive system the blood sugar system and the adrenal system and from there
[02:17:21.080 --> 02:17:23.960]  you get heart disease from there you get cancer from there you get
[02:17:23.960 --> 02:17:27.160]  skin diseases from there you get all the diseases that we're treating with
[02:17:27.160 --> 02:17:31.080]  drugs they're at the top of the tree if you want to treat disease you have to
[02:17:31.080 --> 02:17:33.640]  go to the root and that means the digestive system
[02:17:33.640 --> 02:17:36.920]  the blood sugar system and the adrenal system which is connected to the
[02:17:36.920 --> 02:17:40.520]  thyroid when we're born alex human beings are born with big heads
[02:17:40.520 --> 02:17:44.280]  because we're smarter than other animals. We have big heads. So we come out of the womb early
[02:17:44.280 --> 02:17:49.480]  because the head has to come through the birth canal. So nature has designed a system where we
[02:17:49.480 --> 02:17:54.840]  come out of the womb early. That means that our digestive system and our immune system are immature.
[02:17:54.840 --> 02:18:00.120]  So nature has designed a system where mother's milk, human breast milk will provide factors
[02:18:00.120 --> 02:18:04.920]  that build your digestive system and your immune system. If you're born without getting breastfed,
[02:18:04.920 --> 02:18:09.240]  or you're not breastfed long enough, or your mother was undernourished, and that basically covers
[02:18:09.240 --> 02:18:16.200]  just about everybody. That's why our cues are dropping. And they knew when they fed babies,
[02:18:16.200 --> 02:18:21.560]  most of this formula is half corn syrup, half. Some of them are 60 plus. They know this is
[02:18:21.560 --> 02:18:26.440]  literally a death sentence to their brain. That's why so many of these adults and people,
[02:18:26.440 --> 02:18:31.560]  it's like you're not even talking to a person. They are mentally retarded.
[02:18:31.560 --> 02:18:34.680]  So how do you deal with something like that? Well, first of all, you've got to have a lot of
[02:18:34.680 --> 02:18:38.920]  motivation. You've got to be motivated to make a change. But the gift of the human body, Alex,
[02:18:38.920 --> 02:18:43.880]  is it will turn on a dime if you turn on a dime. But I'm going back to the viciousness of the system
[02:18:43.880 --> 02:18:47.800]  when they said, women, you all got to go work. And by the way, here's this thing for your baby.
[02:18:47.800 --> 02:18:55.880]  And it is a formula, a formula for a 85 IQ low grade moron. And that's who the general public.
[02:18:56.440 --> 02:19:02.520]  Thank God my mother breastfed me. You're lucky. I mean, thank God. And I've seen the studies where
[02:19:02.520 --> 02:19:07.480]  the CC size of the brain doesn't even grow to your genetic cranial size when you don't get those
[02:19:07.480 --> 02:19:13.000]  fats because you're designed to get that fat from your mother. And now they're saying, don't let babies
[02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:17.640]  have fat in their milk. And they're saying, give them, you know, it's absolutely, we need to give
[02:19:17.640 --> 02:19:21.960]  them statins at birth. Well, cholesterol, breast milk has some of the highest concentrations of
[02:19:21.960 --> 02:19:26.440]  cholesterol in on the planet is in human breast milk. And the brains made out of cholesterol.
[02:19:26.440 --> 02:19:30.440]  Well, the neural sheaths, the cover of the nerves are made out of cholesterol. That's exactly right.
[02:19:30.440 --> 02:19:36.360]  That whole statin drug thing, that's another scandal. Oh my God. But again, the Rockefellers
[02:19:36.360 --> 02:19:40.840]  who funded the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, they had discovered all this. They knew cancer was viral,
[02:19:40.840 --> 02:19:44.840]  put it in the shots. They knew you need cholesterol, get it out of the population.
[02:19:44.840 --> 02:19:49.240]  They literally are turning us into zombies. Stay there. Let's break this down. The other side,
[02:19:49.240 --> 02:19:51.800]  pharmacist, Ben Fuchs is our guest. We'll be right back.
[02:19:57.640 --> 02:20:03.800]  Has the United States been discovered in the Bible? Where does Islam fit in Bible prophecy?
[02:20:03.800 --> 02:20:10.200]  Is the new world order world government? These and other crucial in time questions are answered
[02:20:10.200 --> 02:20:16.360]  in the new DVD package, understanding the end time from anti ministries. Jesus Christ said,

[02:24:02.600 --> 02:24:23.240]  By the way, ladies and gentlemen, we're only going to have Aaron here for five minutes. He's
[02:24:23.240 --> 02:24:29.720]  going to be interviewing Ben Fuchs in a two-part LinkedIn interview that we'll air the first of
[02:24:29.720 --> 02:24:37.240]  tonight on Infowars Nightly News and then the other second part later in the week. But at the
[02:24:37.240 --> 02:24:41.320]  same time, of course, I am always promoting whatever I'm getting into, whether it's gold,
[02:24:41.320 --> 02:24:47.400]  whether it's the Second Amendment, whether it's Ron Paul, been supporting Ron Paul for 17 years,
[02:24:48.120 --> 02:24:51.560]  been supporting the Second Amendment for a long time, been pushing gold and silver for 12 years,
[02:24:51.560 --> 02:24:58.840]  and it's gone from gold $260 an ounce to 1,700 plus silver from $5 an ounce to 30 plus.
[02:24:58.840 --> 02:25:04.760]  And I am promoting this. Tangy Tangerine, beyond Tangy Tangerine, my mother, I gave her some of
[02:25:04.760 --> 02:25:08.840]  this. She's not an vitamins and minerals. She's a big exercise person. She tried some stuff over
[02:25:08.840 --> 02:25:14.600]  the years. She did it. Now she begs for me to get her more and has lost a ton of weight. And she
[02:25:14.600 --> 02:25:18.440]  says before, when she would do long-distance swimming, sometimes it would get kind of painful,
[02:25:18.440 --> 02:25:22.920]  like her muscles were kind of, you know, almost catching. Now she says it's like they're oiled,
[02:25:23.480 --> 02:25:27.800]  and my mom just, I was always in great shape. She's in killer shape now. I know there's some
[02:25:27.800 --> 02:25:32.040]  NBA basketball players I saw online that actually take this and say...
[02:25:32.040 --> 02:25:35.480]  The O'Ratlett. The O'Ratlett. Yeah. He says his longevity is because of this.
[02:25:35.480 --> 02:25:40.920]  Right. And then there's pollen burst, which I also take, but it's got some, what, 70 milligrams
[02:25:40.920 --> 02:25:45.400]  of the caffeine in it. So instead of that afternoon coffee that didn't even do anything anymore,
[02:25:45.400 --> 02:25:49.560]  I just hit one of these bad boys and it's got all the B vitamins and it's awesome. But quite
[02:25:49.560 --> 02:25:54.040]  frankly, it's the Tangy Tangerine. And like you said, the worse off you are, because I was in really
[02:25:54.040 --> 02:25:59.960]  bad shape from overworking and not being healthy, the worse you are, the better you feel it just
[02:25:59.960 --> 02:26:03.480]  immediately. Now I brought Aaron in here. I drug him during the break, which is not even two mics
[02:26:03.480 --> 02:26:07.880]  set up. In fact, I called him in here 30 seconds before. Look at Aaron, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:26:07.880 --> 02:26:13.640]  Dun, dun, dun. In fact, we can zoom in over here with this camera. Aaron, you had to have lost
[02:26:13.640 --> 02:26:18.280]  60 pounds. Yeah. That's awesome. Probably 64. That's awesome. That's awesome, bro. Good job.
[02:26:18.280 --> 02:26:23.960]  Good job. That was hard. Not really. I mean, I've been, I've been working out a lot harder before
[02:26:23.960 --> 02:26:27.800]  and didn't lose the weight. It was when I took the right vitamins. That's awesome. That's right.
[02:26:27.800 --> 02:26:32.200]  He was running, jogging and lifting weights. And I said, Aaron, I'm getting fat. You're getting
[02:26:32.200 --> 02:26:35.960]  a little overweight. I said, let's commit to workout. What about a year or two years ago?
[02:26:35.960 --> 02:26:39.640]  And you'd leave work to go work out and come back. It didn't work. Didn't work for me.
[02:26:39.640 --> 02:26:44.920]  As soon as you start going, wait, I'm going to take a protein shake because then in my body
[02:26:44.920 --> 02:26:48.920]  isn't hungry. Don't fight the craving or I'm going to take a mineral drink. It's over. I mean,
[02:26:48.920 --> 02:26:52.200]  I've only been really doing this for two and a half weeks now. I kept eating around the edges,
[02:26:52.200 --> 02:26:56.440]  screwing around. I've been doing this two and a half weeks and actually I went 11 pounds lost.
[02:26:56.440 --> 02:27:02.040]  11 pounds on Tangy Tangerine and the One World Way by the way. It happens to everybody, Alex.
[02:27:02.040 --> 02:27:06.600]  I can't tell you how many times I've seen this happen. The reason I get so passionate about
[02:27:06.600 --> 02:27:12.040]  this is because I've seen it over and over and over again. Blood pressure. And the system knows.
[02:27:12.040 --> 02:27:15.720]  The system knows. They have to know. It's biochemistry. What I'm telling you here is not
[02:27:15.720 --> 02:27:21.560]  my theory. This is biochemistry. There's hard wiring for sugar in your brain. If you give your body
[02:27:21.560 --> 02:27:26.440]  protein, you won't want the sugar. There's hard wiring for fat in your brain. If you give your
[02:27:26.440 --> 02:27:31.000]  body essential fatty acids, you won't want the French fries. There's hard wiring for minerals.
[02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:35.480]  If you give your body good minerals, you won't want the salt. Ted Anderson's dad couldn't go
[02:27:35.480 --> 02:27:39.480]  fishing and didn't know who he was anymore. Ted for a few months got him on Tangy Tangerine,
[02:27:39.480 --> 02:27:44.120]  essential fatty acids. He knew who he was going to go fishing. He was back. He went to the doctor.
[02:27:44.120 --> 02:27:48.840]  The medical doctor said, I've tested his blood. And because he's on Cuma, then he's not allowed
[02:27:48.840 --> 02:27:53.080]  to have these vitamins like this. Take him off. And he's gone again. And Ted gave me permission
[02:27:53.080 --> 02:27:58.440]  to tell this. They take you off of broccoli. They take you off of cruciferous vegetables
[02:27:58.440 --> 02:28:02.360]  because they have. No, that's what they said. That's what they said. No, no green vegetables.
[02:28:02.360 --> 02:28:07.240]  That's what they tell you. You're on vitamin K. And he's gone. And I hate to be mean, but Ted says
[02:28:07.240 --> 02:28:11.560]  I can tell it. His mother says, we're doing what the doctor says. And it's basically bye-bye to
[02:28:11.560 --> 02:28:18.600]  Ted's dad. When it worked in a couple months, his dad was literally back. They know the doctor knows.
[02:28:18.600 --> 02:28:21.880]  It's biocaps. They know. That's what they told him. No green vegetables.
[02:28:22.600 --> 02:28:27.640]  I'm rubbing it. Now we're al-Qaeda. No green vegetables. Vegetables. Well, I'm going to do it.
[02:28:27.640 --> 02:28:31.800]  I'm going to tell you, I'm going, I'm going the errand around. I'm going all the way, man.
[02:28:31.800 --> 02:28:37.560]  It happens, Al. You watch what happens at 11 pounds is nothing. Watch what happens in the
[02:28:37.560 --> 02:28:43.560]  next six months. Watch what happens. The body is so forgiving. It is so resilient. It is so loving.
[02:28:43.560 --> 02:28:47.960]  As soon as you turn around, it turns around. Close shots of snackie. That's his nickname
[02:28:47.960 --> 02:28:53.960]  around here. Anyways, that's a German for snail, the lightning snail. Look at Aaron. I wish we
[02:28:53.960 --> 02:29:00.120]  had a camera right here. I mean, Aaron, Aaron, you can show him the guns. Come on. Hey, I'm doing
[02:29:00.120 --> 02:29:07.400]  better than I was. I mean, hey, I know. Hey, silver from $5 a 30 plus gold from 260 to 1800 or
[02:29:07.400 --> 02:29:11.000]  whatever. I only promote what I believe in. And I've seen the results of this with my mother.
[02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:14.600]  But my mother's saying she might even, and she's reclusive when it comes to radio,
[02:29:14.600 --> 02:29:20.280]  she might even come out and endorse this info wars.com to get it or info wars team.com.
[02:29:20.280 --> 02:29:24.680]  And your, your purchase goes towards supporting us beyond tangy tangerine,
[02:29:24.680 --> 02:29:28.040]  complete multi vitamin mineral complex. We'll talk about it when we come back.

[02:29:34.760 --> 02:29:38.920]  oxidative damage and stress. We're all coming back with Ben Fuchs, Aaron, Snackie, Dyches,
[02:29:38.920 --> 02:29:51.720]  and more straight ahead. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[02:29:51.720 --> 02:30:01.720]  network. A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important
[02:30:01.720 --> 02:30:07.080]  day in America in more than 50 years. He says it will change everything about our lives. The way

[02:30:11.320 --> 02:30:15.880]  your own family. Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years. The crazy
[02:30:15.880 --> 02:30:21.080]  part is he's usually right. You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Panny May, Friday, Mack,
[02:30:21.080 --> 02:30:25.960]  and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties. In fact, Barron's called his work
[02:30:25.960 --> 02:30:30.840]  a dire prophecy. Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing
[02:30:30.840 --> 02:30:35.560]  his biggest and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener. I can't stress this
[02:30:35.560 --> 02:30:39.880]  enough. You should at least watch this free video online today. He explains everything you need to

[02:32:11.720 --> 02:32:17.800]  states on earth. This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps,
[02:32:17.800 --> 02:32:23.240]  now being expanded nationwide. This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program
[02:32:23.240 --> 02:32:28.360]  has established an old powerful shadow state. Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to
[02:32:28.360 --> 02:32:34.360]  which our republic has fallen. Prepare to enter the secret of world of emergency dictatorship.

[02:33:05.640 --> 02:33:10.440]  or was and Hardy was going to be in town a few weeks ago. So I said, come on up to Austin
[02:33:11.160 --> 02:33:15.320]  and then once he gets in here and starts talking about this, I start promoting it.
[02:33:15.320 --> 02:33:18.920]  And when I did the research and found out about young Jebedy and the fact that they're one of
[02:33:18.920 --> 02:33:23.880]  the biggest companies now and buy up all the stuff that Dr. Wallach and his advisors you have
[02:33:23.880 --> 02:33:29.800]  studied and think is the best, that's what I got behind. And you can go to infowarsteam.com
[02:33:29.800 --> 02:33:34.360]  and sign up to be a distributor. There are a lot of people have done that thousands and thousands.
[02:33:34.360 --> 02:33:39.880]  I think something like 10,000 people now just at infowarsteam.com or you can just go there and buy
[02:33:39.880 --> 02:33:45.320]  the products or if you're like my mom and don't order online, I just simply give it to her. But
[02:33:45.320 --> 02:33:49.640]  you can also sell it to friends and family. And I'm telling you, I just gave this to multiple
[02:33:49.640 --> 02:33:53.960]  members of my family and they came back later. So I've been doing the Tangy Tangerine now off
[02:33:53.960 --> 02:33:58.680]  and on for about eight, nine months and started promoting this. And you really enjoyed it and
[02:33:58.680 --> 02:34:04.520]  felt it right away. But then automatically I started getting addicted to it, which tells me,
[02:34:04.520 --> 02:34:10.680]  oh, my body really wants this. And then now that I've combined it with the whey protein in the
[02:34:10.680 --> 02:34:15.960]  morning, and then I'm not as hungry all day. And then at night instead of pigging out, bam,
[02:34:15.960 --> 02:34:22.440]  I just have that. And it's amazing. Two and a half weeks, 11 pounds. And I've been jogging.
[02:34:22.440 --> 02:34:27.240]  I've been lifting weights and it wasn't doing anything. My muscles just got bigger.
[02:34:28.440 --> 02:34:31.960]  Tell us what is in the Beyond Tangy Tangerine. I'll tell you what's in there. But the most
[02:34:31.960 --> 02:34:37.240]  important part about the Beyond Tangy Tangerine is its liquid. And the body processes liquids
[02:34:37.240 --> 02:34:41.480]  different differently than a process of solids. When you eat a solid food, the digestive process
[02:34:41.480 --> 02:34:46.360]  has to kick in. When you drink a liquid, it goes right to work. And because almost 70 million,
[02:34:46.360 --> 02:34:52.040]  maybe more Americans have digestive problems. If you drink your nutrients, you bypass any kind
[02:34:52.040 --> 02:34:56.440]  of issues that you have with the digestive system, the stuff goes right to work. And that's the most
[02:34:56.440 --> 02:35:00.760]  beautiful thing about that stuff is you feel it really quickly because it's going right to work.
[02:35:00.760 --> 02:35:06.680]  We're going to show a photo of Aaron just in Switzerland in June, six months ago tonight,
[02:35:06.680 --> 02:35:11.720]  when he interviews you versus what he looks like now. Looks like another person, doesn't it?
[02:35:11.720 --> 02:35:15.880]  Yeah. Looks like a second person. You're going to see the old Alex Jones too. I'm going all the way
[02:35:15.880 --> 02:35:23.080]  down. At my biggest years ago, I was 270. And then I went down to about 240, just running and
[02:35:23.080 --> 02:35:27.560]  lifting and not eating and then couldn't do it anymore. Went back up about 250. Now I'm going
[02:35:27.560 --> 02:35:33.480]  down to like 238, but I'm going to go all the way down to 180. I'm doing it. I'm going to 180.
[02:35:33.480 --> 02:35:37.800]  Can I do it, Aaron? Sure, of course. We've all got to do it in the fight against the New World Order.
[02:35:37.800 --> 02:35:43.480]  You're not going to be able to withstand cravings, which just willpower alone. The drives are built
[02:35:43.480 --> 02:35:49.400]  into your brain for these things. For many years, for eons, we linked calories with nutrition. Today,
[02:35:49.400 --> 02:35:54.440]  we get calories without nutrition. So our brain says, that wasn't it. Go get some more calories,
[02:35:54.440 --> 02:35:59.080]  expecting to get nutrients with those calories, but it doesn't happen. But you hit it with a way
[02:35:59.080 --> 02:36:03.480]  shake. You hit it with nutrients. Goodbye. Tell folks what's in whey and why it's so good. Whey is
[02:36:03.480 --> 02:36:09.400]  ridiculously important. In fact, next to human mother's milk, whey protein is the old and eggs,
[02:36:09.400 --> 02:36:14.760]  maybe. Whey protein is the most nutrient dense food for... And that's cow milk protein. Well,
[02:36:14.760 --> 02:36:18.600]  it's one of the proteins in cow's milk. There's two major proteins in cow's milk,
[02:36:18.600 --> 02:36:26.200]  cacine and whey. The whey part of milk contains growth factors and immune stimulating factors,
[02:36:26.200 --> 02:36:30.200]  building the immune system. You're talking about cancer. The body has cancer fighters built into it.
[02:36:30.200 --> 02:36:36.120]  The body has molecules and entities that kill cancer. And those are part of the immune system.
[02:36:36.120 --> 02:36:42.040]  When you drink whey protein, the globulins, the proteins in the whey protein that are supposed
[02:36:42.040 --> 02:36:46.280]  to build the cow's immunity, the cow's immunity, go into your immunity and build your immune system.
[02:36:46.280 --> 02:36:53.560]  I'm not joking. About a month ago, we started getting regularly in the office raw milk from
[02:36:53.560 --> 02:36:59.320]  San Antonio from a farm down there. And we added it with the whey protein. And I'm not kidding.
[02:36:59.320 --> 02:37:02.920]  I looked around the people we've been drinking. So I'm working to pronounce it. I said, are you high?
[02:37:03.880 --> 02:37:08.040]  And I was like, yeah, this is not placebo. We didn't say drink it. We're going to feel high.
[02:37:08.040 --> 02:37:13.960]  I literally get high off of it. I mean, like high, like whoa. Because I think that raw milk then
[02:37:13.960 --> 02:37:19.000]  activates the cold pressed whey. Well, whey protein has got everything you need to build things,
[02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:23.320]  to build muscle, to build tissue. So if you're weightlifting, if you're fighting a disease,
[02:37:23.320 --> 02:37:28.040]  if you're recovering from something, whey protein has all of the factors that are required for your
[02:37:28.040 --> 02:37:31.640]  body to build. But you know what I'm talking about? I mean, I guess I was so undernourished
[02:37:31.640 --> 02:37:36.760]  that drinking raw milk with whey in it. I mean, not like the same high you get
[02:37:36.760 --> 02:37:40.920]  drinking a Coca-Cola that's got corn syrup in it. I mean, it was like I felt really good.
[02:37:41.720 --> 02:37:45.800]  Whey protein contains something called tryptophan. Tryptophan is an amino acid that's involved.
[02:37:45.800 --> 02:37:50.840]  Number one in the neurotransmitter serotonin, which makes you really happy, really relaxed.
[02:37:50.840 --> 02:37:55.480]  And number two in the hormone melatonin. And both serotonin and melatonin are not only important
[02:37:55.480 --> 02:38:00.040]  for mood stabilization, they're important for plugging into spirituality, for plugging into
[02:38:00.040 --> 02:38:04.920]  the big picture via the pineal gland. Pineal gland is this tiny little gland that sits in the middle
[02:38:04.920 --> 02:38:09.240]  of your head and it processes serotonin and melatonin. And serotonin and melatonin, if you
[02:38:09.240 --> 02:38:12.840]  ever take melatonin, you know you have great dreams, are involved somehow in our connection
[02:38:12.840 --> 02:38:17.720]  with spirituality. And so when you take tryptophan, when you take things that have tryptophan,
[02:38:17.720 --> 02:38:21.880]  you stabilize and you help promote melatonin, serotonin, metabolism, not only does it make
[02:38:21.880 --> 02:38:26.680]  you feel happy, it doesn't make you feel blissful and it makes you feel plugged in. It makes you
[02:38:26.680 --> 02:38:31.000]  feel connected. It makes you feel like there's something going on in a big picture kind of sense,
[02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:34.840]  which is why they want you on Prozac and not on tryptophan. I was about to say because
[02:38:35.400 --> 02:38:39.800]  so tryptophan I've heard is called the natural Prozac. It's the natural Prozac, but it works
[02:38:39.800 --> 02:38:43.720]  via this connection with the pineal gland. But I mean, what a surprise, God gives us cows,
[02:38:43.720 --> 02:38:48.680]  we're drinking the real thing. The globalists are so evil, they take everything good away.
[02:38:48.680 --> 02:38:53.720]  Oh, check this out. Fluoride is specific for the pineal gland. Fluoride is specific for
[02:38:53.720 --> 02:38:58.440]  the gland that is involved in serotonin and melatonin metabolism. The pineal gland
[02:38:58.440 --> 02:39:03.960]  fluoridates. It absorbs fluoride more than or almost as much as any other system in the body
[02:39:03.960 --> 02:39:07.480]  and the pineal gland is your connection. And so does the thyroid. What is this? Wow,
[02:39:07.480 --> 02:39:12.760]  what is the numbers? I've seen numbers that it's exponential women above 30 with thyroid
[02:39:12.760 --> 02:39:17.640]  dysfunction. It's an epidemic. It's an epidemic. The thyroid gland is connected to your adrenal
[02:39:17.640 --> 02:39:21.320]  glands and your adrenal glands are your stress glands. Those are the glands that are responsible
[02:39:21.320 --> 02:39:25.000]  for, that's the gland that's responsible for helping you combat stress. The more stress you
[02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:32.040]  have, the more hyperadrenal you are, the slower your thyroid will function to compensate for that.
[02:39:32.040 --> 02:39:36.600]  So what we have is a culture that is so stressed out, not just psychologically and emotionally,
[02:39:36.600 --> 02:39:40.520]  but also physiologically, that we're all hyperadrenal and our adrenal glands are burning
[02:39:40.520 --> 02:39:45.480]  out. The thyroid's response to that is to slow down to compensate. The adrenal glands give you
[02:39:45.480 --> 02:39:50.760]  this hyped up caffeine energy. The thyroid gland gives you a nice smooth, easygoing energy.
[02:39:50.760 --> 02:39:55.960]  Over time, when the adrenal glands are kicking in, the thyroid compensates by slowing down.
[02:39:55.960 --> 02:40:01.080]  So this hyperadrenalism leads to hypothyroidism. And from that point forward, Alex,
[02:40:01.080 --> 02:40:05.560]  every single disease is possible because the thyroid regulates every one of the one.
[02:40:05.560 --> 02:40:11.320]  Well, here's what's going on. How long are you here in town? You have to get on an airplane today, right?
[02:40:11.320 --> 02:40:14.680]  Well, as soon as the show's over, we've got to go in there and tape this two-part interview.
[02:40:14.680 --> 02:40:19.320]  And I want you to go through it all with people and with Aaron, and for Aaron to throw in points.
[02:40:19.320 --> 02:40:24.120]  And Aaron is a private guy. I've drugged Aaron in here. But Aaron, you can be a testament to
[02:40:24.120 --> 02:40:27.800]  other people. I mean, you're a great example. Tell folks, because I've even listened to this show,
[02:40:28.680 --> 02:40:33.400]  out of the full spectrum of research, I know you've told me, Fuchs is one of your main sources.
[02:40:33.400 --> 02:40:37.240]  Overall, what have you done? Let's say my wife's listening right now, because she's
[02:40:37.240 --> 02:40:41.160]  wanting to implement even more of this. I'm wanting to just enough to hear the show some
[02:40:41.160 --> 02:40:46.600]  and research it some to really dive into this. What have you done, Aaron, to lose 65 pounds in,
[02:40:46.600 --> 02:40:51.400]  what, six months? I mean, again, I was working out. I just wasn't getting much results. It was
[02:40:51.400 --> 02:40:57.240]  very hard to kick the bad foods, basically, but it finally sunk in after a few months of hearing
[02:40:57.240 --> 02:41:02.280]  this stuff. I was already taking the multivitamins, the liquid stuff, and started taking the EFAs.
[02:41:02.280 --> 02:41:08.920]  But once I took the Omega 3 and 6 EFAs twice daily or three times daily, and then the whey
[02:41:08.920 --> 02:41:14.360]  powder twice daily, that is when I started losing weight very rapidly. So instead of doing an
[02:41:14.360 --> 02:41:18.760]  Adkins diet where you just eat giant amounts of meat, and then you're all with all the hormones
[02:41:18.760 --> 02:41:23.880]  and chemicals, you just take the essential fatty acids and the whey powder, and now you're not
[02:41:23.880 --> 02:41:28.760]  hungry. I could not eat, especially in the first two or three months of this. I just, I couldn't
[02:41:28.760 --> 02:41:35.080]  even hardly eat anything. And then you just nibble on, on, on some vegetables, fruits,
[02:41:35.640 --> 02:41:41.880]  and nuts and stuff. Let me tell you, I'm going completely on this. One of the greatest strategies
[02:41:41.880 --> 02:41:47.720]  you can employ to stay younger, to lose weight, and to prevent disease, is to under-calorize,
[02:41:47.720 --> 02:41:52.840]  to take less calories than you need. Because when the body perceives that it's getting less
[02:41:52.840 --> 02:41:58.760]  calories, it wants to send you out on a hunt for, for zebra and for wildebeest. So it sends the
[02:41:58.760 --> 02:42:04.040]  energy to your legs and builds muscle. Now this is just under-calorie, under-calorization slightly.
[02:42:04.040 --> 02:42:08.760]  And so you want to under-eat slightly. No, no, they got studies in mice, rats, insects, everything.
[02:42:08.760 --> 02:42:13.640]  They live longer. Exactly when they bring it down to almost starvation, but a high nutrient diet.
[02:42:13.640 --> 02:42:19.880]  Exactly. High nutrients, low calories. And the only way to do that, Alex, the only way to do that
[02:42:19.880 --> 02:42:24.680]  is to get on a supplement program. The reason young Jevity is so wonderful is because it's so
[02:42:24.680 --> 02:42:29.400]  easy to do. When you get on a supplement program, you give your body nutrients without calories,
[02:42:29.400 --> 02:42:34.360]  every marker of health and longevity improves. It's the number one way to improve health and
[02:42:34.360 --> 02:42:38.840]  longevity life. And the system knows this and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and sells us food to make
[02:42:38.840 --> 02:42:43.080]  us sick, which they then give us treatments for. That's right. This is all biochemistry. This is
[02:42:43.080 --> 02:42:48.520]  not theory. This is how the body works. When it perceives low calories, it sends you out on a hunt.
[02:42:48.520 --> 02:42:53.480]  It makes you sharper. In fact, there are neurotransmitters in your brain that keep you alert when you're on. No, no, no
[02:42:53.480 --> 02:42:59.880]  That's what that's the one reason I before would just try to willpower diet. Yeah is that I got super smart super aggressive and
[02:43:00.400 --> 02:43:04.240]  Super angry. I mean, I mean when I would go on diets and just not eat very much
[02:43:04.240 --> 02:43:07.520]  I was my brain nutrients without yeah, exactly
[02:43:07.520 --> 02:43:12.200]  But I was my I had lots of energy, but I was really mean when you're missing key nutrients probably
[02:43:12.200 --> 02:43:15.240]  It's not you don't want to just starve yourself. You want to give yourself no, no exactly
[02:43:15.240 --> 02:43:18.960]  You're saying a high nutrient low calorie. I need to listen. I want to talk about this right now
[02:43:19.080 --> 02:43:24.800]  Folks can call if they want to have any questions or get involved with the ungevity 877-551
[02:43:25.760 --> 02:43:27.760]  1301 877-551
[02:43:28.440 --> 02:43:30.440]  1301 and
[02:43:31.200 --> 02:43:36.400]  Expanding on that you can hear Ben over there drinking his his pollen birds
[02:43:36.880 --> 02:43:40.520]  They're in the background and you can also go to info wars team
[02:43:40.520 --> 02:43:48.240]  Dot com and part of the proceeds when you buy the different vitamins and minerals and essential fatty acids and nutrients that are there
[02:43:48.880 --> 02:43:52.400]  Goes to fund the info wars media operation again
[02:43:52.400 --> 02:43:55.560]  We're not like revolutionary communists that rob banks to fund ourselves
[02:43:55.560 --> 02:44:00.440]  We promote things we believe in in free market and I've done deep research because over the years
[02:44:00.440 --> 02:44:05.640]  I turned down so many vitamin mineral things. I did research research when I finally got ready to get into it myself
[02:44:05.640 --> 02:44:12.840]  Boom, I chose young Jebedee and it's something you can get involved in as a home business or to sell in your grocery store
[02:44:13.280 --> 02:44:21.840]  To sell in areas where you have a connection to the public or or or your little five-and-dime or your gas station
[02:44:21.840 --> 02:44:25.080]  Whatever the case is people need to get this
[02:44:25.840 --> 02:44:30.760]  Information and they need to get involved and again, that's info wars team dot com
[02:44:30.760 --> 02:44:35.760]  There's banners up at info wars.com. You can't forget it info wars team dot com
[02:44:35.760 --> 02:44:43.000]  There it is on screen or call 877-551-1301 now tell us about pollen burst Aaron
[02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:48.640]  Do you want a pollen burst or do you want a tangy tangerine? I like this too, but I was gonna do a pollen burst down here
[02:44:48.640 --> 02:44:53.920]  Here's a pollen burst tell us Ben what is in this couple by the way when you got in here
[02:44:53.920 --> 02:44:56.080]  I just say quit quit popping your bottle and drinking and
[02:44:56.080 --> 02:45:01.140]  Referee went live you actually started taking a pollen burst right when you got in here heck yeah the first time I met you out in
[02:45:01.240 --> 02:45:03.000]  California you were visiting
[02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:06.560]  MZ's radio stations. He's got myself and you on you you were in there
[02:45:06.560 --> 02:45:09.680]  You know, I like to mix the beyond tangy tangerine with the pollen burst
[02:45:09.680 --> 02:45:14.800]  Okay, well, let's hear the pollen versus got the B vitamins in there and the B vitamins are so fascinating because
[02:45:16.200 --> 02:45:20.600]  Most people are going to be deficient in the B vitamins because they're rapidly processed out of food
[02:45:20.600 --> 02:45:22.800]  So if you're eating foods that are cooked if you're eating foods that are
[02:45:22.800 --> 02:45:26.360]  Of frozen if you're eating foods that are prepared in any way
[02:45:26.360 --> 02:45:30.200]  You're going to be deficient in these B vitamins and the B vitamins work on the parts of the body
[02:45:30.480 --> 02:45:36.560]  That move the fastest the brain the heart the skin and the digestive system
[02:45:36.560 --> 02:45:40.280]  Those are the four systems that that respond rapidly to the B vitamins
[02:45:40.280 --> 02:45:41.920]  So you notice when you start taking the pollen burst
[02:45:41.920 --> 02:45:46.560]  You know B vitamins will help you think and it's great if you if you have a test to take if you're a student
[02:45:46.560 --> 02:45:49.920]  The B vitamins are important for the heart and by the way when it comes to heart disease
[02:45:49.920 --> 02:45:57.120]  We got 600,000 people in this country who die of heart disease every year some 64 million Americans have some form of heart disease
[02:45:57.680 --> 02:46:05.480]  Some form of heart disease one form or another the B vitamins a nickel's worth of B vitamins every day is the most powerful
[02:46:06.040 --> 02:46:07.880]  Nutritional way to protect yourself from heart disease
[02:46:07.880 --> 02:46:13.400]  It may be the single most powerful thing you could do to protect yourself and look heart disease is getting worse all the stuff
[02:46:13.400 --> 02:46:18.160]  And if you look 50 years ago, they were eating chicken fried steaks gravy
[02:46:18.160 --> 02:46:21.480]  They didn't have that many heart attacks or cancer if you look at it
[02:46:21.480 --> 02:46:25.120]  It's not even the quote unhealthy food that they've taught us that is the main cause of this
[02:46:25.120 --> 02:46:32.760]  It's all the additives and the petrochemical companies that get authorization to put poison the food because they know it's addicting
[02:46:32.760 --> 02:46:37.720]  Tell us about MSG and stuff as we add rinks in polymers classified is one of the
[02:46:38.320 --> 02:46:44.400]  One compounds classified as an excitotoxin what that means that makes your brain so happy that you'll think that the
[02:46:44.400 --> 02:46:52.160]  R utmost rottenest piece of crap tastes like cherry pie or it tastes something like something delicious because it tricks your brain into
[02:46:52.160 --> 02:46:56.560]  Being really happy the Japanese were the ones who pioneered pioneered MSG so they could
[02:46:57.840 --> 02:47:04.080]  Feed their soldiers crappy food. They could the soldiers would eat the crappy by the way that's on record
[02:47:04.080 --> 02:47:06.200]  Yeah, the soldiers would eat the crappy food
[02:47:06.200 --> 02:47:12.560]  They thought thought they were eating filet mignon, but they were eating the crappiest one by the way in Europe and in Japan and China
[02:47:12.560 --> 02:47:18.760]  It's a gourmet place. You've got a book six months out to eat pure soaked MSG crud
[02:47:18.840 --> 02:47:22.640]  Same thing with the hot wings by the way now if I eat MSG within hours
[02:47:22.640 --> 02:47:25.520]  I have a horrible headache. I've developed a total allergy to it
[02:47:25.520 --> 02:47:28.600]  So they know what they're doing you're playing with brain chemistry
[02:47:28.600 --> 02:47:33.000]  The last thing you want to do is play with your brain chemistry with artificial chemicals
[02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:36.000]  Well, I tell you expanding on that
[02:47:37.240 --> 02:47:40.720]  This should be criminal what they do, but but there's other chemicals they put in the food
[02:47:40.720 --> 02:47:45.240]  You know, but we're participating Alex. We volunteer nobody forces us to go eat this stuff
[02:47:45.240 --> 02:47:49.520]  We're volunteering. Yeah, but the FDA says we're the government. We're keeping you safe, right?
[02:47:49.520 --> 02:47:53.040]  Well, if you're gonna trust the FDA, you know, yeah, that's a big point, too
[02:47:53.040 --> 02:47:56.400]  Though I've heard you read those quotes on there the founding fathers Benjamin Rush
[02:47:56.880 --> 02:47:59.920]  Benjamin Rush warned about this stuff Benjamin Rush signed the Declaration of Independence
[02:47:59.920 --> 02:48:04.600]  He was a medical doctor and he warned about the hegemony and tyranny of modern medicine
[02:48:04.600 --> 02:48:09.840]  Well, it's always which doctors that take over because they know how humans work throughout society. They manipulate Aaron
[02:48:09.840 --> 02:48:11.840]  You want some of this here? You want that spoon?
[02:48:12.480 --> 02:48:19.800]  The biggest statement you can make Alex the most powerful statement you can make is to disengage from the machine at every turn
[02:48:19.800 --> 02:48:26.720]  I've got that and I am sold. I have barely I've gone 10 degrees towards you and I've already seen massive results
[02:48:26.720 --> 02:48:30.280]  That's awesome. I have come ten and Aaron has turned 180 degrees
[02:48:30.520 --> 02:48:34.000]  Right pointed straight where Ben Fuchs is and look at the results exactly
[02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:38.920]  So I'm slowly turning myself towards you and if I just remember to eat the way shake
[02:48:38.920 --> 02:48:43.000]  If I just remember to take the tangy tangerine if I remember to take I mean
[02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:45.840]  I when I do eat the essential fatty acids from young Jevity
[02:48:46.480 --> 02:48:52.440]  I'm literally not hungry and my brain works better. Exactly. What do you recommend people buy as a starter pack at info wars team?
[02:48:52.440 --> 02:48:55.240]  dot-com the ultimate EFA is the osteo FX and the
[02:48:55.520 --> 02:48:59.480]  Beyond tangy tangerine is in the Alex pack. It's discounted if you buy all three
[02:48:59.480 --> 02:49:05.080]  It's a perfect way to demonstrate how powerful this is not just for the person buying it
[02:49:05.080 --> 02:49:10.400]  But for somebody who's watching the person buying it for a loved one of the who's watching somebody well
[02:49:10.400 --> 02:49:15.840]  That's why young Jevity is literally so successful is because people literally see the results
[02:49:15.840 --> 02:49:20.560]  They see the results just like it just like what's happened Aaron and Alex. This is not a miracle
[02:49:20.560 --> 02:49:25.360]  This is not magic. We're supposed to be Kenyan runners. That's what we're supposed to be
[02:49:25.360 --> 02:49:29.560]  We're supposed to be lean and mean from the way ever seen a Kenyan runner
[02:49:29.560 --> 02:49:34.280]  That's what human beings are supposed to be every pound you have that's above a Kenyan runner is something
[02:49:34.280 --> 02:49:38.720]  That's a part of our dysfunctional society. It's a life a lifestyle choice that you made
[02:49:38.720 --> 02:49:44.760]  So picture yourself as a Kenyan runner and then picture the difference between you and it as a Kenyan runner and that difference
[02:49:45.080 --> 02:49:51.600]  represents the lifestyle choices and the dysfunctional culture that we've immersed ourselves in as you begin to incorporate these strategies you
[02:49:51.600 --> 02:49:54.440]  Reverse that and you become closer to a Kenyan runner
[02:49:54.440 --> 02:50:00.520]  You know what I mean by a Kenyan runner lean and mean no no things are supposed to be grayhounds is what we're supposed to be exactly right now
[02:50:00.520 --> 02:50:06.360]  Now what is it? We've been domesticated. We've been like a difference between a lion and a pussycat. We're the pussycat
[02:50:06.360 --> 02:50:10.480]  We've been domesticated. We're supposed to be lions and we get domesticated through the
[02:50:11.080 --> 02:50:14.240]  Foods that we're eating and the ways we participate in our culture
[02:50:14.240 --> 02:50:18.760]  So if you want to get your feralness back if you want to get your vigor back if you want to get your
[02:50:19.760 --> 02:50:24.840]  Zest for life back you have to reverse that process and the way you do it the first thing you do is
[02:50:24.840 --> 02:50:31.520]  nutritional supplementation and calorie restriction and then working out as well as something to build muscle well
[02:50:31.520 --> 02:50:36.440]  That's the thing is that set of even eating something just go for a run that burns fat
[02:50:36.440 --> 02:50:38.600]  You have a meal right there. You get a well
[02:50:38.600 --> 02:50:42.040]  Here's another thing bought a female hormone is produced in body fat
[02:50:42.240 --> 02:50:50.960]  So the more body fat you're carrying the more feminized you become that means gynecomastia, which means breasts that means impotence and sexual problems
[02:50:50.960 --> 02:50:55.480]  That means lower resistance to disease stay there. We'll be right back

[02:54:18.280 --> 02:54:21.400]  Pretty amazing clip that we played in the second hour
[02:54:22.320 --> 02:54:27.520]  If you missed it, it's up at info wars calm the Congress now
[02:54:28.440 --> 02:54:31.840]  has come out and made the announcement that
[02:54:31.840 --> 02:54:37.200]  Obama requested the secret arrest and disappearance of citizens of the bill
[02:54:39.120 --> 02:54:43.440]  Of course, we already knew that from his actions his announcements. He said he could do it himself
[02:54:43.440 --> 02:54:48.400]  But the fact is that's the new level of deception. We're dealing with here. Unbelievable
[02:54:49.280 --> 02:54:56.480]  Tonight's info wars nightly news is going to be particularly power packed Aaron Dyches is going to be hosting it and with Ben Fuchs. You don't want to miss that
[02:54:56.480 --> 02:55:02.880]  But going back in a few minutes. We've got left. We'll do the little five minute addendum in overdrive this internet only here in a moment
[02:55:02.880 --> 02:55:05.760]  The official radio show in turn about five minutes
[02:55:06.720 --> 02:55:12.320]  Aaron I was just talking to you during the break and you said look it's so easy when you take the young Jebedee
[02:55:12.880 --> 02:55:19.360]  Minerals and and vitamins because now your body's got that then you've got protein on top of it from the way
[02:55:20.000 --> 02:55:24.320]  You've got the essential fatty acids. You've got everything your body wants. You're just not going to miss that
[02:55:24.320 --> 02:55:27.280]  The acids you've got everything your body wants. You're just non-hungry anymore
[02:55:27.360 --> 02:55:32.080]  But you're eating things where the weight's going to pour off of you. In fact, how are you going to stop the weight loss?
[02:55:32.720 --> 02:55:34.720]  When do you plan to quit?
[02:55:35.360 --> 02:55:38.640]  Yeah, I guess, um, yeah, I don't know what's going to happen then
[02:55:40.240 --> 02:55:43.680]  But yeah, it was very easy. I mean it makes me want to work out more anyway
[02:55:44.320 --> 02:55:47.840]  So I started with taking the multivitamins just basically to see if it works
[02:55:47.840 --> 02:55:53.360]  I did notice the difference and then I started focusing more on the way and the efa's with the multivitamins
[02:55:53.360 --> 02:55:58.960]  And the weight just poured off and working out was a lot easier anyway, but I wasn't working out nearly
[02:55:59.680 --> 02:56:02.320]  Even half as hard as I was two years ago a year ago
[02:56:03.440 --> 02:56:04.960]  Very moderate really
[02:56:04.960 --> 02:56:08.480]  The trick is you don't want to be you don't want to be forced to like looking for food all the time
[02:56:08.480 --> 02:56:12.240]  You know Alf people are looking for food all the time. They live to eat
[02:56:12.400 --> 02:56:18.240]  They live every minute of the day is spent thinking about what the next piece of food is is because their body is so starving
[02:56:18.240 --> 02:56:24.320]  Their brain is so starving for nutrients that it sends them on this one pointed hunt for food and instead it's getting empty calories
[02:56:24.320 --> 02:56:30.640]  So it's more more more more appetite and appetite and satisfaction are regulated by chemistry
[02:56:30.640 --> 02:56:34.640]  What we're talking about here is nothing less than hacking into the brain's chemistry
[02:56:34.880 --> 02:56:40.800]  To tell the brain that you're full and tell the brain that you're satisfied. I hate willpower. I have no willpower
[02:56:40.960 --> 02:56:45.520]  I don't believe it should be hard when you start using nutritional supplements you hack into the brain's
[02:56:45.520 --> 02:56:50.960]  Satisfaction centers and the brain sends the the message that everything is right you're sad
[02:56:51.040 --> 02:56:55.040]  We could put the new world order out of business in a revolution
[02:56:55.360 --> 02:57:00.400]  If we just all of us to the transformation you guys have gone through if I can do it and we can air this tape
[02:57:00.720 --> 02:57:03.200]  You know six months from now and I'm 180 pounds
[02:57:03.520 --> 02:57:10.320]  And show people and say by the way the system knows this and none of them will tell you because they want the racket to continue forever
[02:57:10.400 --> 02:57:13.920]  If you weren't spending all your energy and your time and your money looking for food
[02:57:13.920 --> 02:57:18.960]  What kind of energy and time and money would you have to do other things? Hey, what do you think would be to california?
[02:57:19.200 --> 02:57:22.160]  Yeah, I remember I have that memory of him telling you how you could lose weight
[02:57:22.560 --> 02:57:26.880]  And that was that was a year ago. I thought they were real weird because we went out to eat and they didn't eat anything
[02:57:26.960 --> 02:57:28.960]  and they were just sitting there and
[02:57:28.960 --> 02:57:32.160]  I didn't know about the vitamins yet. I mean I heard about them, but hadn't tried them yet
[02:57:32.160 --> 02:57:35.600]  No, I was like then they're like space aliens. They all look really healthy, but they don't eat
[02:57:37.520 --> 02:57:39.520]  We're like
[02:57:39.600 --> 02:57:41.600]  Yeah, I'm telling you Aaron. Yeah, that was in um
[02:57:41.600 --> 02:57:46.160]  That was in Santa Cruz. Yeah, I heard about it then and then a few months later when you start promoting
[02:57:46.160 --> 02:57:48.480]  I said, I'm gonna try this but once I put my money
[02:57:48.720 --> 02:57:51.680]  I wanted to make sure I was taking them and see if there's results or not
[02:57:52.240 --> 02:57:57.040]  And well living testimony. It's folks camera puts 10 pounds on you if you saw Aaron in person
[02:57:57.440 --> 02:58:00.480]  It is unbelievable. Hey 11 pounds in two and a half weeks with me
[02:58:01.120 --> 02:58:05.840]  And that's just gonna keep going. It's gonna keep going. No, no, I haven't even put it all into function yet

[02:58:30.800 --> 02:58:35.840]  I don't want to lose my guns. I don't have guns. I have fat little arms. No, they are actually big guns, but
