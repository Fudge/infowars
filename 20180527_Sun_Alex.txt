[00:00.000 --> 00:29.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is going to be one of the most important broadcasts we've ever
[00:29.680 --> 00:37.440]  engaged in. We are seeing true communist Chinese style or Nazi style police state behavior
[00:37.440 --> 00:44.640]  in the UK where Tommy Robinson, frequent guest of this show, has been disappeared given 13
[00:44.640 --> 00:50.720]  months sentence in one hour and there's a national ban on talking about it and I've
[00:50.720 --> 00:56.920]  talked to scores of reporters and others who are afraid to even come on air. Fox News then
[00:56.920 --> 01:03.520]  talked to his lawyer who said, I can't tell you I'll be arrested. What was Tommy Robinson
[01:03.520 --> 01:11.920]  reporting on? Giant confirmed child kidnapping rings nationwide. But then yesterday, as I
[01:11.920 --> 01:17.120]  saw hundreds of articles about it late at night, by the morning time they were all disappeared
[01:17.120 --> 01:23.600]  including US news stories denoticed by the British government. That's why this is so
[01:23.600 --> 01:32.760]  huge. Then Roger Stone joins us to break the biggest Mueller news yet. He is going to break
[01:32.760 --> 01:39.720]  exclusive news here. He believes he may be arrested or grabbed anytime starting tomorrow
[01:39.720 --> 01:44.160]  for the next two weeks. But he's been told you make up stuff about Trump. You roll on
[01:44.160 --> 01:48.920]  Trump or you are going to be destroyed. He will be joining us in the second hour. There's
[01:48.920 --> 01:55.040]  so much more. Chinese ships came into the South China Sea, the most navigated area in
[01:55.040 --> 02:00.240]  the world, like a giant super highway of the ocean. It said we own this, all ships out.
[02:00.240 --> 02:04.360]  You must have our authorization to come in. US ships went in. The Chinese threatened to
[02:04.360 --> 02:12.040]  attack them today. But they backed down. But China said we vow retaliation. This is unbelievable.
[02:12.040 --> 02:15.600]  So this is just an incredible time to be alive to show what the appeasement of our government
[02:15.600 --> 02:20.760]  has done. Here's part of a Mike Cernovich video. He caught this early in the morning
[02:20.760 --> 02:25.720]  before they deleted the articles because at first you'd click through and it'd say denotice
[02:25.720 --> 02:32.160]  or, depending on the publication, Sky Television, right Bart, you name it, it would just say
[02:32.160 --> 02:37.880]  oops, an error. So it all disappeared. This is proof. People didn't believe me on Monday
[02:37.880 --> 02:42.280]  morning when I was tweeting that there was a denotice out. They had that in England banning
[02:42.280 --> 02:48.320]  news reportage or citizens talking about news. It's beyond communist China and it's expanded
[02:48.320 --> 02:53.280]  and expanded and expanded from court gags to total gags. Here's part of that video that
[02:53.280 --> 03:00.360]  he dubbed the scariest thing you'll see today. I say this whole move of tyranny is one of
[03:00.360 --> 03:04.720]  the scariest things you'll see this year or in your lifetime if we don't turn this around.
[03:04.720 --> 03:30.720]  Here's part of that report.
[03:30.720 --> 03:52.280]  Let's go see one by one. 404. 404. Oops. Oops. Go do it yourself. Go into Google News. We'll
[03:52.280 --> 04:02.440]  just show you how to do it. Just go to Google News, type in Tommy Robinson. Find his articles
[04:02.440 --> 04:08.120]  and again here we'll just show you again. All right. He goes on for another three minutes
[04:08.120 --> 04:12.280]  breaking it down. I retweeted it at real Alex Jones. Now, you're watching on some TV, you
[04:12.280 --> 04:18.320]  can see this, dredgerport.com. Oh, look, he's got articles about Tommy Robinson, activist
[04:18.320 --> 04:24.160]  Tommy Robinson arrested outside UK court jail for 13 months on the same day. Third link
[04:24.160 --> 04:32.000]  judge orders media blackout. Boom. Fox News. Fox News folks. Something has gone wrong.
[04:32.000 --> 04:38.440]  It seems you clicked on a bad link and stumbled upon a 404 error. So now that's been taken
[04:38.440 --> 04:44.280]  down. Then they reposted it. But obviously to another link not on servers available in
[04:44.280 --> 04:49.960]  the UK, they somehow geo located it or geo blocked it. This is happening everywhere in
[04:49.960 --> 04:59.240]  live time and it's all coming up today as the censorship in the West goes into overdrive.
[04:59.240 --> 05:03.760]  If you needed more proof that Amazon's Alexa device is nothing more than glorified spy
[05:03.760 --> 05:08.400]  tech, a family in Portland, Oregon claims the device allegedly recorded their private
[05:08.400 --> 05:14.240]  conversations and then sent the audio files to a random person in the family's contact
[05:14.240 --> 05:18.720]  list. When they received a phone call from one of the husband's employees saying unplug
[05:18.720 --> 05:23.440]  your Alexa devices right now, you're being hacked. The family thought it was a joke until
[05:23.440 --> 05:28.720]  the employee was able to recount details of their private conversation. The employee told
[05:28.720 --> 05:33.960]  them that he received audio files of recordings from inside the house. The family's entire
[05:33.960 --> 05:38.520]  house was connected to Amazon devices that controlled the heat, lights, and security
[05:38.520 --> 05:43.520]  system. Danielle, who is understandably asked the local news station to keep her last name
[05:43.520 --> 05:47.960]  anonymous at this point, said at first she and her husband thought it was a joke. After
[05:47.960 --> 05:52.480]  listening to the recorded files for herself, Danielle admitted feeling invaded, saying
[05:52.480 --> 06:19.640]  I'm never plugging that device in again because I can't trust it. Leanne McAdoo, infowars.com.
[06:22.480 --> 06:46.080]  There's a point where you put the frog in the pot of water and at first it's cold and
[06:46.080 --> 06:53.080]  nice and then the temperature slowly, incrementally, the success of approximation goes up. And
[06:53.080 --> 07:01.600]  once the frog gets to, you know, 104 degrees or so, like a hot tub, it tends to pass out.
[07:01.600 --> 07:07.440]  It tends to go into a trance and then it never wakes up and ends up as frog legs on somebody's
[07:07.440 --> 07:18.600]  Louisiana or Mississippi or South Texas Cajun plate. And America and Europe and Australia
[07:18.600 --> 07:29.000]  and Canada are now deep, deep into censorship, deep into globalist control. And the level
[07:29.000 --> 07:34.000]  is just getting more and more intense every day. We're seeing some of the death struggles
[07:34.000 --> 07:43.480]  of nationalist and populist movements and the Trump movement here in this country. The
[07:43.480 --> 07:55.000]  globalists believe, but then if we decide to actually take our culture back and realize
[07:55.000 --> 08:09.160]  just how serious the threat is, this won't be our death throes. This will be our rebirth.
[08:09.160 --> 08:30.800]  Now, that said, I'm trying to pick my words here as judiciously as I can because I really
[08:30.800 --> 08:40.160]  want to be calm about this. But when you see somebody like Tommy Robinson, who 11 years
[08:40.160 --> 08:46.360]  ago was the first person to expose Muslim, grooming and mass sex trafficking range that
[08:46.360 --> 08:51.760]  we know are run in Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia and are part and parcel of
[08:51.760 --> 08:57.760]  that Stone Age culture. There have been slave caravans and slave women and slave children
[08:57.760 --> 09:09.600]  being sold for 6000 plus years of recorded history in North Africa, in the Middle East
[09:09.600 --> 09:14.560]  and in Central Asia. By the way, other cultures were selling slaves as well. It's just those
[09:14.560 --> 09:21.960]  cultures never came up to the 21st century. So I have a whole stack of mainstream British
[09:21.960 --> 09:28.680]  news after 11 years of them covering it up, having to admit that indeed every major town
[09:28.680 --> 09:37.080]  has thousands of little girls and some boys trained, recruited and then put into sex slavery
[09:37.080 --> 09:42.480]  by age 9, 10, 11. And if the parents, the poor parents get up and say, no, the police
[09:42.480 --> 09:48.360]  come and set them up and arrest them and have CPS child protective services take their children.
[09:48.360 --> 09:56.160]  We're now having parliamentary hearings on this so they could cover it up for decades
[09:56.160 --> 10:01.360]  but because of Tommy Robinson breaking the ice, blowing a hole in the lie, being put
[10:01.360 --> 10:06.760]  in prison for a year five years ago over this and not shutting up, others had the courage
[10:06.760 --> 10:11.120]  to go public. So the pedophile rings that run England, that's mainstream news, are
[10:11.120 --> 10:19.120]  really angry. So now they've ordered in the courts that no one report on the trials, period.
[10:19.120 --> 10:26.640]  Don't even say they exist. And so Tommy Robinson was arrested on Friday. He already had a suspended
[10:26.640 --> 10:31.240]  sentence from last year after serving three months in prison. He had 13 months of a suspended
[10:31.240 --> 10:36.960]  as long as he, quote, wouldn't go into trials and cover them live, which he'd done before.
[10:36.960 --> 10:39.920]  Like press should be able to do until a few years ago, anywhere in the Western world.
[10:39.920 --> 10:44.640]  They have to protect the pedophilia. You can go any other trial you want. So he just went
[10:44.640 --> 10:48.360]  outside one. I watched the whole live stream after it was archived and just said they're
[10:48.360 --> 10:57.120]  having a grooming trial here. Didn't say the details, any of that. And so they arrested
[10:57.120 --> 11:02.080]  him, took him to jail and within one hour, I've now talked to some of his crew that's
[11:02.080 --> 11:05.800]  joining us at the bottom of the hour. They said, don't worry. Don't call your family.
[11:05.800 --> 11:11.080]  Don't call your kids, any of that. You don't need a lawyer. You'll be out in an hour. The
[11:11.080 --> 11:14.920]  judge laughed at him. It was even caught on video smiling and laughing. There's photos
[11:14.920 --> 11:22.480]  of videos of that outside. And the judge said, you're going to jail for 13 months in a high
[11:22.480 --> 11:28.480]  security prison where the Islamists are the majority in London and it promised to kill
[11:28.480 --> 11:34.600]  you. He's now in whole prison. So by the next day, thousands marched on 10 Downing Street.
[11:34.600 --> 11:42.400]  That's their White House. They're inclining the fences saying free Tommy Robinson. There
[11:42.400 --> 11:55.360]  was then a D notice issued saying, do not report anywhere in the press on his arrest.
[11:55.360 --> 12:02.480]  And so more articles on that gut pull. Now this is all confirmed. We reported on it Friday
[12:02.480 --> 12:07.720]  and Saturday. Fox News has a big article that details it. It's up on infowars.com because
[12:07.720 --> 12:11.600]  they removed the Fox News article. It just disappeared. Not corrected. The one that
[12:11.600 --> 12:17.720]  Drugs is Linked to, it's just gone. Fox News confirms Tommy Robinson sentenced to 13 months
[12:17.720 --> 12:25.000]  for reporting on pedophile grooming trial. Here's the Fox News article that's been deleted.
[12:25.000 --> 12:28.880]  The link that Drugs is linked to has been deleted. Right wing activist Tommy Robinson
[12:28.880 --> 12:36.360]  reportedly jailed after filming outside child grooming trial. This is Fox News. Confirming
[12:36.360 --> 12:40.280]  everything we already told you, but it says it's shocking. His lawyer isn't allowed to
[12:40.280 --> 12:47.960]  talk to us. He says this is a police state. The grooming trials. All of it. You've got
[12:47.960 --> 12:53.640]  to read this article. We have excerpt seven on infowars.com and Kit Daniels article. Fox
[12:53.640 --> 12:57.000]  News confirms Tommy Robinson sentenced to 13 months reporting on pedophile grooming
[12:57.000 --> 13:01.000]  gangs. Now, in case you just joined us and don't believe all this, because believe me,
[13:01.000 --> 13:04.840]  my own listeners yesterday afternoon, I was shooting live reports. They were like, Alex,
[13:04.840 --> 13:09.400]  there's not a ban on reporting on Tommy Robinson. And then they started commenting and the feeds
[13:09.400 --> 13:15.800]  going, oh, we apologize. There is. Oh my God, you can do that in England. Yeah. If you say
[13:15.800 --> 13:21.800]  you don't like radical Islam, they arrest you now. Okay. Right wing activist Tommy Robinson
[13:21.800 --> 13:29.480]  reportedly jailed for filming outside grooming trial. Fox News. Now, let's look at some of
[13:29.480 --> 13:34.700]  the mainstream news articles, even reporting on this vice. A look back at the pedophile
[13:34.700 --> 13:39.080]  scandals that swallowed Britain whole. But remember, they just banned free speech after
[13:39.080 --> 13:48.360]  that to shut it down. That was 2014. That's vice saying that. What was the Rotterham scandal?
[13:48.360 --> 13:53.280]  All you know about the sickening systematic abuse. And here's all the Muslim men and the
[13:53.280 --> 14:02.000]  workers they worked with. That's the sign. Rotterham sexual exploitation of children
[14:02.000 --> 14:08.000]  scandal Wikipedia. That's a white wash. But go read about it. 2010. Who exposed that?
[14:08.000 --> 14:14.240]  Where was Tommy Robinson from? That town. So that's why he's in jail out of a real movie
[14:14.240 --> 14:18.440]  fighting real pedophile rings and trying to report on it and gone. And the government
[14:18.440 --> 14:23.800]  says you don't report on it. Tellford child abuse. New victims come forward after a member
[14:23.800 --> 14:30.160]  of parliament says she has been inundated with reports from all over the country. Unindependent.
[14:30.160 --> 14:33.480]  Now the independent wanting report on this. That's from earlier this year. But now they're
[14:33.480 --> 14:38.640]  just there covering it up. Here's another one. Toronto Sun PC cop social workers ignored
[14:38.640 --> 14:44.200]  Brit pedophilic gang that raped over 1000 girls in one town. Don't tell you it's Islamic. Something
[14:44.200 --> 14:48.600]  Brit's Islamic. But you've got now since it turns out the social workers were working
[14:48.600 --> 14:52.960]  with the whole thing. Tellford social services chief is one of the three counselors exposed
[14:52.960 --> 15:04.560]  as pedos. The mirror. And it goes way back to previous governments show. That's going
[15:04.560 --> 15:11.360]  on. You've got the brave activists, the father, family man in prison for 13 months, a suspended
[15:11.360 --> 15:14.800]  sentence for covering the last thing last year. This time he didn't even say names or
[15:14.800 --> 15:21.880]  go in. And now, oh, well, let's go further. Let's tell everybody they can't report on
[15:21.880 --> 15:27.480]  Tommy Robinson or even say his name. And later, I'm going to read part of the Fox News article.
[15:27.480 --> 15:31.680]  You've got to hear it from them. It sounds like Alex Jones is saying it saying how incredible
[15:31.680 --> 15:35.800]  and how dangerous this is. And then everybody shows up and starts climbing the fences at
[15:35.800 --> 15:41.240]  10 downing. So then there's a news blackout on that and then more big demonstrations today.
[15:41.240 --> 15:45.800]  All right, don't forget for Memorial Day, we got free shipping and info or store.com

[16:53.960 --> 16:58.040]  back against us. So we need your support.
[16:58.040 --> 17:03.600]  Western Europe has already banned free speech and an iron curtain of censorship is ascending
[17:03.600 --> 17:10.200]  down over the UK. They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or
[17:10.200 --> 17:15.720]  gays, you'll get six months in prison. We know we're only about a year or two behind
[17:15.720 --> 17:20.680]  what's happening in the UK. CNN and many others are calling for info wars to be shut down,
[17:20.680 --> 17:26.760]  taken off the web. Slate magazine has a professor and others saying go beyond censorship, brainwash
[17:26.760 --> 17:32.560]  young people against info wars, psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually
[17:32.560 --> 17:36.920]  hear what we have to say. We are the most hated news source in the world by globalist.

[20:02.440 --> 20:23.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. He aligns himself with the truth that it's time
[20:23.040 --> 20:34.320]  for you to choose a side. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Fox News is reporting
[20:34.320 --> 20:40.400]  exactly what I've been told by Tommy Robinson's associates. The British activists exposing
[20:40.400 --> 20:48.440]  giant pedophile rings, exposing the UK's government to sell out to radical Islam. Fox
[20:48.440 --> 20:55.080]  News is confirming by talking to Robinson's lawyer that the British public has been told
[20:55.080 --> 21:01.360]  not to speak his name and not to say that he's been imprisoned and not to discuss why
[21:01.360 --> 21:10.400]  he was imprisoned. That is in official newspapers in the US and Breitbart and others that have
[21:10.400 --> 21:18.160]  UK offices have complied. And now the DrudgeReport.com Fox News link to that article that I've printed
[21:18.160 --> 21:25.040]  out has been deleted. But I went and found a new URL where it's been reposted but not
[21:25.040 --> 21:32.080]  available in the UK. Do you understand the magnitude of this? It's about a nine on the
[21:32.080 --> 21:39.360]  Richter scale of tyranny when they are arresting people for reporting on corruption and then
[21:39.360 --> 21:45.320]  disappearing them and then saying none of you talk about it or you'll be arrested too.
[21:45.320 --> 21:52.400]  It's Nazi Germany level. That's Soviet Russia level. That's Chinese Communist level. And
[21:52.400 --> 21:58.080]  you look at the universities are anti free speech. You look at the left attacking not
[21:58.080 --> 22:03.560]  just me with water but I saw video over the weekend of two different Fox News reporters
[22:03.560 --> 22:09.520]  having coffee and tea thrown on them at restaurants. People videotape it, they walk over, they throw
[22:09.520 --> 22:18.000]  it on you. Next person does that. That's assault. I'm going to clobber you. But that's how authoritarian
[22:18.000 --> 22:24.400]  the left's gotten worldwide trying to force us into their control. It's got a message
[22:24.400 --> 22:31.280]  from Nigel Farage during the break. He said Italy is about to explode. We need to send
[22:31.280 --> 22:39.760]  reporters there. Absolutely. Humanity is awakening. So if you just joined us, I've got a ton of
[22:39.760 --> 22:45.240]  news coming up. I've got Tommy Robinson's main editor and cameraman joining us coming
[22:45.240 --> 22:50.080]  up as soon as he gets back in the next few minutes from the huge demonstrations that
[22:50.080 --> 22:55.440]  are ongoing in downtown London at Speaker's Corner at 10 Downing Street now into day two
[22:55.440 --> 23:01.880]  of thousands taking to the streets, running over the police, climbing over the gates.
[23:01.880 --> 23:06.320]  And the mainstream media is only showing close up shots. I showed shots yesterday that we
[23:06.320 --> 23:10.800]  found of showing the thousands and thousands of people. In fact, if the crew wants to find
[23:10.800 --> 23:14.400]  it, you can just go to any of my reports from yesterday in studio and I started each report
[23:14.400 --> 23:24.080]  with those real C wide shots that are unbelievable. Now, Colin Robinson, filmmaker, political
[23:24.080 --> 23:31.080]  writer, social commentator. He was banned by the university for retreating Islam. He
[23:31.080 --> 23:38.480]  is a free contributor to Tommy Robinson dot online. He will be joining us. But this is
[23:38.480 --> 23:43.480]  the reign of terror going on in the UK and in Europe where you do not criticize Islam
[23:43.480 --> 23:47.760]  in any way because they have put the police in. They put the head of the border patrol
[23:47.760 --> 23:58.840]  in in the UK. They've got the major mayors in place. It is unbelievable. Now, let's go
[23:58.840 --> 24:09.320]  ahead and go over the Fox News report confirming all this. Just so you know, this is mainstream,
[24:09.320 --> 24:12.920]  but there's a blackout on the reporting and you think you're reading something about North
[24:12.920 --> 24:20.480]  Korea or the old Soviet Union. This is going on. And now the story has been deleted. Right
[24:20.480 --> 24:27.040]  wing activist Tommy Robinson reportedly jailed after filming outside child grooming trial.
[24:27.040 --> 24:34.440]  UK right wing activist and journalist Tommy Robinson was arrested and reportedly jailed
[24:34.440 --> 24:39.880]  Friday after he filmed members of an alleged child grooming gang entering a court for trial.
[24:39.880 --> 24:44.840]  He's about as radical as your average Fox News report. It'd be Brian kill me. But the
[24:44.840 --> 24:50.440]  details of his purported sentence remain murky after the judge ordered the press not to report
[24:50.440 --> 24:56.280]  on the case. Oh, wow. Robinson, the former head of the English Defense League and a long
[24:56.280 --> 25:01.920]  time activist against Islam and Islamic migration was arrested after he was filming men accused
[25:01.920 --> 25:06.920]  of being part of a gang that groomed children. That's not on the tape. So they just say that
[25:06.920 --> 25:12.560]  Britain has been rocked by a series of child sex scandals perpetrated by gangs of predominantly
[25:12.560 --> 25:19.040]  Muslim men. Video shows Robinson, whose real name is Steven Lennon being surrounded by as
[25:19.040 --> 25:24.720]  many as seven police officers as he live streamed the incident on his phone. He never puts out
[25:24.720 --> 25:28.320]  his real name because they attack his children. They come to his house. He's been put in jail
[25:28.320 --> 25:33.040]  for a year for exposing the grooming gangs years ago. So there they are outing his real
[25:33.040 --> 25:37.640]  names. They can find out where he lives. The police informed him he was being arrested
[25:37.640 --> 25:41.720]  for breach of the peace. But shortly after his arrest, a source with knowledge of the
[25:41.720 --> 25:46.800]  case told Fox News that he had been jailed for 13 months on contempt of court charge.
[25:46.800 --> 25:55.760]  A court listing indicated the case was closed by Friday afternoon, one hour after his arrest.
[25:55.760 --> 26:00.240]  One source said he was jailed in whole prison. That's confirmed. The prison declined to comment
[26:00.240 --> 26:04.920]  to Fox News and whether Robinson was there. Leeds Crown Court also did not return a request
[26:04.920 --> 26:11.600]  for information. Won't even tell you where someone is and say don't talk about it. And
[26:11.600 --> 26:15.600]  don't talk about the pedophiles. According to the independent, Robinson was already on
[26:15.600 --> 26:20.960]  a suspended sentence for contempt of court over a gang rape case in 2017 that he was
[26:20.960 --> 26:26.040]  exposing. The judge in the case on Friday slapped a reporting ban on the case. The order
[26:26.040 --> 26:29.040]  bans reporters from reporting on the case if there's reason to believe the reporting
[26:29.040 --> 26:33.120]  could prejudice the trial. The trial's over, folks. It's in deliberations. So see how that
[26:33.120 --> 26:38.120]  works? The order prevents reporting until the conclusion of the trial, Robinson was
[26:38.120 --> 26:41.840]  reporting on. So they're saying don't report on him being disappeared to prison. The gag
[26:41.840 --> 26:46.600]  order led to news outlets in the UK removing their reporting. See, people on Twitter couldn't
[26:46.600 --> 26:49.680]  believe me when I first told them this. He's like, oh, you don't, they don't tell people
[26:49.680 --> 26:55.200]  not to report. That's England's a free country. Why look at the Royal Wedding. The gag order
[26:55.200 --> 26:58.480]  led to news outlets in the UK removing the reporting from their websites to comply with
[26:58.480 --> 27:04.440]  the order. Most remaining, most. Remaining reporting in the UK comments on his arrest,
[27:04.440 --> 27:10.320]  but not on the reason he was arrested or sentenced reporting on government back child kidnapping
[27:10.320 --> 27:15.960]  ranks. Sources with knowledge of Robinson's case spoke on condition anonymity in the part
[27:15.960 --> 27:20.640]  because they fear they would be arrested for contempt. So we're having one of the few people
[27:20.640 --> 27:25.440]  who has the courage to come on next segment. One told Fox News off record that Robinson's
[27:25.440 --> 27:30.560]  lawyer warned that considering the presence of Muslim gang members in the prison, a 13
[27:30.560 --> 27:35.960]  month sentence was sent him out to a death sentence for Tommy Robinson. We can't tell
[27:35.960 --> 27:41.040]  you why this hero is even in jail. If you're in England, Tommy's lawyer said he will likely
[27:41.040 --> 27:45.640]  die in jail given his profile and previous credible threats. And the judge basically
[27:45.640 --> 27:51.560]  said he doesn't care. The source said he sentenced him to 13 months. Reaction to Robinson sentencing
[27:51.560 --> 27:55.280]  from commentators and writing politicians was fierce, particularly as is the latest in
[27:55.280 --> 27:59.040]  a series of commentators, particularly those who are critical of Islam and mass Islamic
[27:59.040 --> 28:06.280]  immigration in the UK being locked up by British authorities or conservatives and libertarians.
[28:06.280 --> 28:09.040]  They just search engine you when you fly into the country and you're there with your wife
[28:09.040 --> 28:12.480]  and kids. But if you're a conservative or libertarian or a Christian activist, you're
[28:12.480 --> 28:18.080]  banned from coming in. That's Fox News, folks. And that's a whitewash compared to what's
[28:18.080 --> 28:24.040]  really going on. This is coming here. This is what the left is already doing here. And
[28:24.040 --> 28:29.360]  I guess the Fox News story is they have Sky Television and Division of News Corp over
[28:29.360 --> 28:34.320]  there in the UK. At least it used to be. They're changing things up right now. They have New
[28:34.320 --> 28:40.560]  Fox, that's just media and sports, splitting off entertainment, getting bought by Disney.
[28:40.560 --> 28:46.880]  But the article's gone. Something has gone wrong, it says in the URL. Yes, something
[28:46.880 --> 28:53.240]  has gone wrong. That's certainly true when you expose pedo trials and you get sent to
[28:53.240 --> 28:59.400]  a secret president and no one can report on it. That's a problem. Choose to take control

[33:01.880 --> 33:26.880]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:26.880 --> 33:32.200]  There have been massive demonstrations at 10 Downing Street and that's the White House
[33:32.200 --> 33:36.360]  equivalent in London. And at Speaker's Corner and at the parliament the last two days, Colin
[33:36.360 --> 33:44.680]  Robinson, right-hand man of Tommy Robinson, is on the subway, almost back to his house,
[33:44.680 --> 33:50.120]  his flat, so that he can get on the Skype with us. And then Roger Stone called me today.
[33:50.120 --> 33:55.380]  We talked for about 30 minutes and he said, Alex, this is the biggest Mueller news ever
[33:55.380 --> 34:01.240]  I'm going to break on your show. And so that's coming up. He said, it's confirmed Mueller
[34:01.240 --> 34:08.920]  is planning to frame him, not on Russia-related stuff, but on other made-up things and is
[34:08.920 --> 34:14.840]  asking all these personal sexual questions, you name it, of just hundreds of people going
[34:14.840 --> 34:20.760]  back decades to absolutely smear the daylights out of him. And just like they raided Trump's
[34:20.760 --> 34:27.120]  lawyer and then gave the private info about porn stars or whatever to the media and about
[34:27.120 --> 34:31.880]  Sean Hannity having phone conversations with him like that was dirty or bad. Now you're
[34:31.880 --> 34:35.400]  Russian if you're Sean Hannity and you talk to Trump's lawyer who's been your friend for
[34:35.400 --> 34:42.920]  many years. This is the craziness of it. They have all his text messages, all his emails
[34:42.920 --> 34:49.080]  going back for a decade and they're trying to find something and they're threatening
[34:49.080 --> 34:53.000]  people. They find enough of Roger's friends or associates over the years. They'll find
[34:53.000 --> 34:58.640]  somebody's got a problem themselves so they'll make stuff up on Roger in hopes that Roger
[34:58.640 --> 35:07.240]  makes stuff up on Trump and even Politico and the Hill both reported that Mueller wants
[35:07.240 --> 35:12.680]  Roger to flip. But Roger just told me and it's true. None of it's true. There's nothing
[35:12.680 --> 35:18.480]  there. I remember telling Roger, well, if you've got that guy that knows a signs that DJ
[35:18.480 --> 35:23.880]  the new you remember he's coming. I know this New York talk show host that knows him good
[35:23.880 --> 35:27.840]  and he's going to go to London in a few months and hopefully we get something. And I remember
[35:27.840 --> 35:32.560]  Roger going, yeah, no, he won't come on and everybody was trying to get a signs on. The
[35:32.560 --> 35:36.720]  New York Times had him on. Sean Hannity had him on. Anderson Cooper had him on around
[35:36.720 --> 35:41.120]  that time. We're like, why aren't you coming on our shows of signs? Won't the establishment?
[35:41.120 --> 35:45.560]  But as soon as they shut his internet off, oh, now he can't talk to anybody. Now he's
[35:45.560 --> 35:50.960]  per side of non grata. So the idea that we're Russian because we never talked to Assange
[35:50.960 --> 35:56.160]  and there's no proof he got his info from the Russians is thousands of degrees of separation
[35:56.160 --> 36:04.840]  and it's cuckoo land. But now more than a dozen people I've learned have been questioned
[36:04.840 --> 36:14.680]  by Mueller and his team intensely about my relationship with stone. And they keep asking
[36:14.680 --> 36:19.600]  about personal stuff like, well, what goes on between them? And they're like, I don't
[36:19.600 --> 36:22.800]  know anything about it. I know he goes on the show. I know he works. Some of them for
[36:22.800 --> 36:28.200]  us as a contributor until last year. Until this year, stone was a contributor at Fox.
[36:28.200 --> 36:31.440]  They have thousands of people that are on the payroll there. He was on the payroll at
[36:31.440 --> 36:37.120]  Fox. Does that mean Fox isn't, you know, Russian agent group? But it's just crazy to
[36:37.120 --> 36:45.920]  know this. And so I'll tell the FBI right now, I've not had sex with Roger Stone. I'm
[36:45.920 --> 36:50.600]  not even kissing since you want to know. Yes, folks, that's the type of things that are
[36:50.600 --> 36:56.080]  now going on in this country. It came out the press report that I won't even name two
[36:56.080 --> 37:03.720]  weeks ago that lawyers talking to former people that worked here said, Oh, no, no,
[37:03.720 --> 37:07.080]  we don't want employment disputes. We have the witnesses. I'm just waiting till this
[37:07.080 --> 37:12.720]  gets down to brass tacks and our counteraction. We want you to say Jones wants to have sex
[37:12.720 --> 37:21.800]  with you. And to those folks's credit, they said, well, he never said it, but I telepathically
[37:21.800 --> 37:28.200]  thought it. And again, I hadn't seen the new Beavis and Butthead series. Beavis and Butthead
[37:28.200 --> 37:34.120]  came out 25 years ago, but I hadn't seen the new season they did three years ago. I was
[37:34.120 --> 37:39.240]  flipping through channels the other night and I saw Beavis and Butthead the new season
[37:39.240 --> 37:45.680]  and I watched like three of them with my son, the girls had already gone to bed. And I said,
[37:45.680 --> 37:49.200]  is this an old, this is hilarious. He was no, no, my son said, this came out a few years
[37:49.200 --> 37:55.360]  ago, dad, because Beavis and Butthead believe people are telepathically sexually harassing
[37:55.360 --> 38:01.360]  them and they go to court and the judge agrees. And now I understand my life is a literal Beavis
[38:01.360 --> 38:09.040]  and Butthead episode where people telepathically believe I want to have sex with them. It says
[38:09.040 --> 38:19.520]  in the EOC complaint, Jones never made gay advances, but I felt like he wanted it. Oh
[38:19.520 --> 38:29.920]  my God, I mean, that is the mother's like a science fiction comedy. That is a literal
[38:29.920 --> 38:34.880]  Beavis and Butthead episode. Can you guys find it? I bet it's on YouTube. Beavis and
[38:34.880 --> 38:42.200]  Butthead sexual harassment, sexual harassment episode, new season. The lawyer's like, we
[38:42.200 --> 38:46.160]  are going to sue the school, we are going to sue school, the teachers, we are going
[38:46.160 --> 38:51.040]  to sue the principals. And then finally they go into court and they go, she's looking at
[38:51.040 --> 38:55.280]  me. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, she wants me. She wants me. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The judge goes,
[38:55.280 --> 39:00.720]  that's it. I agree. You are sentenced for harassing Beavis and Butthead. And then finally they
[39:00.720 --> 39:05.080]  go over the judge and she goes, good job, boys. They go, you're harassing us. Yeah,
[39:05.080 --> 39:12.160]  yeah, yeah. Then the show ends because that's where this insanity ends.
[39:12.160 --> 39:29.120]  Meanwhile, giant child kidnapping rings in Hollywood in the Vatican from Boys Town, USA
[39:29.120 --> 39:37.560]  to Melbourne, Australia to Vatican City, Italy. It's all confirmed massive child kidnapping
[39:37.560 --> 39:41.600]  rings and they're using Islam to do it because they've always had sex harems and underage
[39:41.600 --> 39:46.240]  people that's authorized in the Quran have sex with nine year olds if you want. That's
[39:46.240 --> 39:53.120]  that's a fact. And if you are someone that has a tanning salon and you're 23 years old
[39:53.120 --> 39:58.000]  like Tommy Robinson, and you see little nine year old girls being pimped down the street
[39:58.000 --> 40:02.000]  corner and you go up and get in fist fights with the Muslims, he started kicking their
[40:02.000 --> 40:06.880]  butts and saving the little girls. And then he take them back to their poor parents, there's
[40:06.880 --> 40:11.640]  always poor kids and they'd say, we tried to do something Tommy, but the police say they'll
[40:11.640 --> 40:17.040]  take all children if we don't let the muzzies have sex with them. These are quotes. So Tommy
[40:17.040 --> 40:22.280]  organized the town and they took his business took his house. The government came and said
[40:22.280 --> 40:27.480]  mortgage fraud, claiming that he didn't make as much as he said on some form and put him
[40:27.480 --> 40:36.040]  in maximum security for over a year and they almost killed him all because he saw little
[40:36.040 --> 40:42.720]  girls from the kebab shop next door being put in cars with men and crying for mommy.
[40:42.720 --> 40:48.640]  I see white guys, Christian guys, Muslim guys, a Catholic priest, a Muslim, anybody with a
[40:48.640 --> 40:53.160]  little kid crying like a pimp with men pulling up the pimp's putting them in there. I'm gonna
[40:53.160 --> 40:59.200]  beat the hell out of them. And folks, that's a normal response. And that's why Tommy's
[40:59.200 --> 41:04.640]  a hero and that's why he's in jail and they have a national ban on him. So as soon as
[41:04.640 --> 41:12.000]  Colin Robinson gets back on that London underground to his house, he'll be on with us. He's very
[41:12.000 --> 41:16.880]  close. I'm told you're in the last break. He may be there now. We'll see in full wars.com
[41:16.880 --> 41:20.680]  news wars.com. You're a radio listener. I want to see the added dimension of video in

[41:25.680 --> 41:28.760]  YouTube, Twitter, realize they're trying to censor that. You've got to hand share those
[41:28.760 --> 41:33.320]  videos. You've got to hand share those articles. That's how you save these children because
[41:33.320 --> 41:37.440]  it's hidden about Tommy Robinson. It's not about Alex Jones. It's not about Donald Trump.
[41:37.440 --> 41:43.940]  It's about a worldwide criminal network using illegal, illicit sex trade to fund their operations
[41:43.940 --> 41:50.640]  and corrupt people to take over government. It's an intelligence operation. And when you
[41:50.640 --> 41:54.160]  fund us and you spread the articles and the links, you are literally standing up to this
[41:54.160 --> 41:59.280]  network. But I've learned that's who's at the heart of it. That's who we're fighting.
[41:59.280 --> 42:03.880]  Radical Islam fits like a hand and glove. We're going to break with so much more coming

[43:20.840 --> 43:26.120]  what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription,
[43:26.120 --> 43:31.280]  but they were charging people a hundred, two hundred dollars for the formula. And I came
[43:31.280 --> 43:36.200]  up with our own formula working with some scientists and developers non GMO made right
[43:36.200 --> 43:42.640]  here in America, 120 capsules. And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglonone to it,

[46:08.480 --> 46:12.880]  yeast. As the years went on and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team
[46:12.880 --> 46:17.600]  knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health. MycoZX
[46:17.600 --> 46:22.120]  Plus is the result of the search for that formula, a unique natural formula designed
[46:22.120 --> 46:26.280]  to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms. There's no better

[47:02.840 --> 47:24.160]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex
[47:24.160 --> 47:33.840]  Jones.
[47:33.840 --> 47:54.880]  This is
[47:54.880 --> 48:01.440]  what the New Pope wants. They want abortion. Ireland just legalized abortion. It'll
[48:01.440 --> 48:03.320]  It'll be a sacrament soon.
[48:03.320 --> 48:06.320]  Well, Kailin Robertson has been there
[48:06.320 --> 48:07.680]  when this happened to Tommy.
[48:07.680 --> 48:09.200]  He's been covering the live events
[48:09.200 --> 48:12.480]  as they scaled the gates there at 10 Downing Street,
[48:12.480 --> 48:14.080]  almost total news blackout.
[48:14.080 --> 48:15.240]  Now they're at Speaker's Corner.
[48:15.240 --> 48:18.240]  He just got back to his place after all of this.
[48:19.080 --> 48:20.460]  They're in London.
[48:20.460 --> 48:21.640]  And if you just joined us
[48:21.640 --> 48:24.220]  on all those radio and TV stations out there,
[48:24.220 --> 48:27.760]  I think it's better if Kailin describes to you,
[48:27.760 --> 48:31.060]  just in a snapshot, who Tommy is, most people know.
[48:31.060 --> 48:32.200]  Now they do.
[48:32.200 --> 48:34.640]  And then the order that the press,
[48:34.640 --> 48:38.520]  thousands of different comments online taken down,
[48:38.520 --> 48:41.240]  hundreds of mainstream news articles from BBC,
[48:41.240 --> 48:43.560]  described television, just deleted the articles
[48:43.560 --> 48:46.760]  and said, we've been given a D notice.
[48:46.760 --> 48:49.040]  So again, England is not as free as folks think.
[48:49.040 --> 48:53.120]  Certainly not if you are actually someone from there.
[48:53.120 --> 48:54.520]  So thank you for coming on.
[48:54.520 --> 48:58.960]  You're at Kailin, Rob on Twitter.
[48:58.960 --> 49:01.840]  And of course, also are the main contributor with the work
[49:01.840 --> 49:05.920]  and the great work we see there at tomirobbinsononline.com.
[49:05.920 --> 49:08.280]  So thank you for coming on with us, sir.
[49:08.280 --> 49:09.120]  Oh, thanks for having me.
[49:09.120 --> 49:10.680]  And you very accurately describe
[49:10.680 --> 49:12.360]  what's been going on in this country
[49:12.360 --> 49:13.320]  in the last few days.
[49:13.320 --> 49:15.120]  We've seen news articles completely wiped out.
[49:15.120 --> 49:16.600]  I've spoken to journalists
[49:16.600 --> 49:19.160]  who are really, really keen for information,
[49:19.160 --> 49:20.720]  who have then later said, sorry,
[49:20.720 --> 49:21.760]  we had to pull the whole story.
[49:21.760 --> 49:23.920]  We can't talk about any of this.
[49:23.920 --> 49:26.520]  It is very, very, very, very worrying.
[49:26.520 --> 49:27.880]  There were even journalists.
[49:27.880 --> 49:30.040]  I mean, there's lots of technicalities
[49:30.040 --> 49:31.560]  about what I can and can't talk about.
[49:31.560 --> 49:34.120]  I was in the courtroom when all of this happened.
[49:34.120 --> 49:35.960]  Obviously, there's a reporting restriction.
[49:35.960 --> 49:38.440]  But when the judge even said
[49:38.440 --> 49:40.000]  that there's a reporting restriction,
[49:40.000 --> 49:41.240]  they closed the books.
[49:41.240 --> 49:44.400]  They wouldn't report on it after that.
[49:44.400 --> 49:47.640]  And it's a very, very, very bizarre situation.
[49:47.640 --> 49:49.280]  Usually reporting restrictions like this
[49:49.280 --> 49:52.880]  are only placed in very, very extreme cases,
[49:52.880 --> 49:54.920]  very, very high-profile cases.
[49:54.920 --> 49:58.200]  And there's not really any reasoning for them to do this
[49:58.200 --> 49:59.720]  in this particular scenario,
[49:59.720 --> 50:01.360]  other than so that people don't know
[50:01.360 --> 50:03.560]  that they've done something wrong.
[50:03.560 --> 50:06.000]  Thank God that you guys are reporting it.
[50:06.000 --> 50:08.800]  Thank God InfoWars is making a deal out of it.
[50:08.800 --> 50:11.640]  And I think Fox News have just spoken about it.
[50:11.640 --> 50:13.600]  And that information is going to the UK.
[50:13.600 --> 50:14.640]  Thousands and thousands,
[50:14.640 --> 50:16.280]  tens of thousands of people have been writing
[50:16.280 --> 50:17.760]  and protesting about this now.
[50:17.760 --> 50:19.440]  They've all been talking about it in the streets.
[50:19.440 --> 50:21.960]  And that information is getting to the general public
[50:21.960 --> 50:25.240]  despite their attempts to stop it.
[50:25.240 --> 50:28.360]  And so hopefully the ball will just keep rolling.
[50:28.360 --> 50:30.440]  And more and more people will look to the US
[50:30.440 --> 50:31.960]  to find that information about this.
[50:31.960 --> 50:33.160]  But in this country,
[50:33.160 --> 50:34.880]  the situation, how it feels,
[50:34.880 --> 50:38.240]  going to pick up a copy of the local newspaper,
[50:38.240 --> 50:39.960]  going to look on any articles.
[50:39.960 --> 50:40.880]  There's a complete blackout.
[50:40.880 --> 50:41.840]  We can't see anything.
[50:41.840 --> 50:43.960]  The only people talking about it are people on Twitter.
[50:43.960 --> 50:45.800]  It's actually very strange.
[50:45.800 --> 50:48.040]  You know, it's a massive news story.
[50:48.040 --> 50:49.760]  And it's completely unreported.
[50:49.760 --> 50:52.760]  It's, the feeling in this country right now
[50:52.760 --> 50:54.360]  is absolutely bizarre.
[50:54.360 --> 50:57.520]  It's intensified the mistrust in the media.
[50:57.520 --> 50:58.920]  People are furious.
[50:58.920 --> 51:02.280]  I actually met someone today who is from the left
[51:02.280 --> 51:03.880]  who works for a very left-wing,
[51:03.880 --> 51:05.600]  very well-known media outlet.
[51:05.600 --> 51:08.240]  And they said they've never seen anger like this before.
[51:08.240 --> 51:10.040]  They said it's actually very, very worrying
[51:10.040 --> 51:11.640]  where this could go.
[51:11.640 --> 51:14.680]  If something happens to Tommy in prison,
[51:14.680 --> 51:16.080]  sorry, I'm just in the middle of that.
[51:16.080 --> 51:16.920]  No, I understand.
[51:16.920 --> 51:18.000]  You weren't able to get back to your house.
[51:18.000 --> 51:21.320]  And so you just got out of a vehicle
[51:21.320 --> 51:22.600]  and are talking to us on the side of the road.
[51:22.600 --> 51:23.440]  It sounds great.
[51:23.440 --> 51:24.840]  We totally understand again.
[51:24.840 --> 51:26.240]  We're talking the main camera person,
[51:26.240 --> 51:28.160]  the main right-hand guy.
[51:28.160 --> 51:30.400]  Tommy Robinson is with us right now.
[51:30.400 --> 51:34.000]  Kalen Robert Son is here with us.
[51:34.000 --> 51:36.200]  And we're talking about an iron curtain of censorship
[51:36.200 --> 51:38.560]  that's taking place in multiple levels
[51:38.560 --> 51:41.320]  of a total power grab with political correctness
[51:41.320 --> 51:42.960]  where they arrest police chiefs
[51:42.960 --> 51:45.240]  that talk about Muslim rapes in Sweden,
[51:45.240 --> 51:47.120]  where the stasi has been reactivated
[51:47.120 --> 51:48.360]  and works for Facebook.
[51:48.360 --> 51:50.200]  You can't make this up to arrest people
[51:50.200 --> 51:51.920]  that criticize Islam.
[51:51.920 --> 51:55.200]  Twitter and Facebook help the government of Pakistan
[51:55.200 --> 51:57.040]  find people that are atheists.
[51:57.040 --> 51:59.680]  They call it blasphemy and they are executed.
[51:59.680 --> 52:01.240]  So you have to understand Twitter, Facebook,
[52:01.240 --> 52:03.720]  and YouTube, Google, especially Apple,
[52:03.720 --> 52:05.720]  they're already working with the Communist Chinese
[52:05.720 --> 52:07.360]  rounding up the Christians and Buddhists.
[52:07.360 --> 52:10.000]  They're already working, helping the Arab Spring
[52:10.000 --> 52:11.520]  throw gaze off buildings.
[52:11.520 --> 52:12.840]  The West funded that.
[52:12.840 --> 52:14.760]  The elites are allied with Islam
[52:14.760 --> 52:16.320]  because there's 1.8 million of them.
[52:16.320 --> 52:19.040]  The West is dying and the decision hasn't been made
[52:19.040 --> 52:21.920]  to rehabilitate the Muslims and bring them into the West.
[52:21.920 --> 52:24.400]  I don't care if they got brown skin, a bunch of them.
[52:24.400 --> 52:28.560]  But their culture is pure absolute evil, many of them.
[52:28.560 --> 52:30.440]  The biggest threat to a Muslim is other Muslims,
[52:30.440 --> 52:32.120]  as you know, Kalen.
[52:32.120 --> 52:35.880]  So get into, I understand this, this iron curtain of tearing.
[52:35.880 --> 52:38.160]  He simply reported that they were having, as you know,
[52:38.160 --> 52:41.680]  huge trials on the child kidnapping rings
[52:41.680 --> 52:44.680]  that he had first exposed and been put in prison for.
[52:44.680 --> 52:46.320]  They gave him a sentence for that.
[52:46.320 --> 52:48.160]  Then he's given 13 months commuted,
[52:48.160 --> 52:50.360]  he simply goes and covers, they're having a trial,
[52:50.360 --> 52:52.160]  nothing about the details of the trial,
[52:52.160 --> 52:54.160]  just that there is a trial, that's totally normal,
[52:54.160 --> 52:56.120]  under jurisprudence, English common law,
[52:56.120 --> 52:58.040]  Magna Carta, Bill of Rights Constitution,
[52:58.040 --> 52:59.920]  and your own law, everybody knows that.
[52:59.920 --> 53:01.400]  They take him to jail for that,
[53:01.400 --> 53:04.800]  and then they order everyone not to talk about it, period,
[53:04.800 --> 53:06.960]  and denotice hundreds of publications.
[53:06.960 --> 53:09.000]  As you said, talking to the members of the press,
[53:09.000 --> 53:12.080]  this is unprecedented, and we have seen thousands
[53:12.080 --> 53:13.240]  hit the streets.
[53:13.240 --> 53:16.600]  Describe what you've witnessed the level of awakening here,
[53:16.600 --> 53:18.920]  that this is beyond the old Soviet Union.
[53:19.960 --> 53:21.800]  Well, this is very, very different.
[53:21.800 --> 53:23.960]  I've been with Tommy for about a year and a half now,
[53:23.960 --> 53:25.320]  we've gone to lots of protests,
[53:25.320 --> 53:29.280]  we've been to universities, we've been around the UK,
[53:29.280 --> 53:32.880]  but something very different has happened,
[53:32.880 --> 53:35.440]  and that's that people are now absolutely
[53:35.440 --> 53:36.680]  furious about this.
[53:36.680 --> 53:39.120]  There's electricity almost in the air,
[53:39.120 --> 53:41.720]  of people who have completely had enough of all of it.
[53:41.720 --> 53:45.120]  You're right about what you said with people being terrified
[53:45.120 --> 53:47.080]  and the establishment, and our very establishment,
[53:47.080 --> 53:48.560]  and our police being terrified about reporting
[53:48.560 --> 53:50.040]  on these grooming gang scandals.
[53:50.040 --> 53:52.880]  We haven't seen press restrictions on any cases
[53:52.880 --> 53:55.040]  with people like Ralph Harris,
[53:55.040 --> 53:57.440]  and all of these big, big, massive high-profile cases
[53:57.440 --> 53:59.440]  with white pedophiles and things like that.
[53:59.440 --> 54:01.920]  We have the BBC with helicopters outside their house
[54:01.920 --> 54:03.520]  to suit us as any accusations.
[54:03.520 --> 54:05.320]  This is completely unprecedented,
[54:05.320 --> 54:07.480]  and people can see straight through it,
[54:07.480 --> 54:10.320]  and you can feel the tension in the air
[54:10.320 --> 54:11.160]  of this country right now.
[54:11.160 --> 54:12.480]  You can cut it with a knife.
[54:12.480 --> 54:14.920]  It's so intense.
[54:14.920 --> 54:19.920]  It's quite scary, actually, seeing where this could go.
[54:19.920 --> 54:22.760]  And obviously, if any harm comes to him,
[54:22.760 --> 54:25.360]  I can predict mass violence across the UK.
[54:25.360 --> 54:29.520]  I can predict towns and cities coming to a standstill.
[54:29.520 --> 54:34.560]  What's about to happen is a change in a way
[54:34.560 --> 54:36.840]  we have never seen before in this country.
[54:36.840 --> 54:38.040]  Everything is shifting.
[54:38.040 --> 54:39.840]  There are journalists, and there are mainstream people.
[54:39.840 --> 54:43.080]  I've had MPs and very, very high-profile people
[54:43.080 --> 54:44.440]  contacting and talking to me,
[54:44.440 --> 54:46.160]  and saying that they want to go straight out,
[54:46.160 --> 54:48.160]  gun blazing, and going against this,
[54:48.160 --> 54:49.760]  but they'll probably lose everything.
[54:49.760 --> 54:53.760]  It's torn apart the fabric of the country right now,
[54:53.760 --> 54:55.360]  and everything sort of fractured.
[54:55.360 --> 54:58.240]  I can't really describe how insane all of this is.
[54:58.240 --> 55:04.720]  I was in an LGBT bar the other day yesterday,
[55:04.720 --> 55:06.640]  and everybody in there was talking about it.
[55:06.640 --> 55:10.320]  We've got fringe groups on the left, gays and transgender people,
[55:10.320 --> 55:12.440]  everybody shaking our hands and talking about it.
[55:12.440 --> 55:16.760]  It's united everybody who has been on the far left.
[55:16.760 --> 55:17.760]  It's very strange.
[55:17.760 --> 55:19.000]  Because the general public,
[55:19.000 --> 55:21.400]  whether you're liberal, conservative, black, white,
[55:21.400 --> 55:24.240]  whatever, you're against pedophilia, even the average Muslim,
[55:24.240 --> 55:26.680]  but you've got this strand of Islam that does it,
[55:26.680 --> 55:27.920]  sex-travelling going on,
[55:27.920 --> 55:30.720]  blacks being sold in cages in Libya, all this,
[55:30.720 --> 55:31.960]  and now we're finding out it's there.
[55:31.960 --> 55:35.320]  And as you said, they find a dead girl at Jimmy Savelle's place.
[55:35.320 --> 55:36.960]  It's national news, it should be.
[55:36.960 --> 55:38.920]  You've got helicopters at the Royal Palace
[55:38.920 --> 55:41.200]  when they find a dead kid buried in the backyard.
[55:41.200 --> 55:43.600]  But now, suddenly, there's a total blackout
[55:43.600 --> 55:46.280]  on these grooming gangs, because, well, don't we know,
[55:46.280 --> 55:49.240]  it came out what a month ago, before they did a blackout,
[55:49.240 --> 55:51.320]  that it turns out the major police
[55:51.320 --> 55:53.040]  and other social worker leaders
[55:53.040 --> 55:55.760]  were using the Muslims in many of these cases.
[55:55.760 --> 55:57.320]  Don't say which ones, I know you can't.
[55:57.320 --> 55:58.280]  Even though it's in the news there,
[55:58.280 --> 56:00.000]  you'll be arrested, think about that, folks.
[56:00.000 --> 56:03.240]  Delivering, they have the Muslims like Renfield,
[56:03.240 --> 56:05.440]  so I'm letting the Muslims off the hook here,
[56:05.440 --> 56:07.760]  are delivering it to the pedo-British elites.
[56:09.040 --> 56:10.160]  Well, they don't, yes, exactly,
[56:10.160 --> 56:11.760]  and they don't quite know what they've done.
[56:11.760 --> 56:13.800]  I think the people who have instigated this,
[56:13.800 --> 56:15.280]  the people who have orchestrated it,
[56:15.280 --> 56:17.760]  the people who thought it was a good idea to silence him,
[56:17.760 --> 56:20.920]  don't, are so out of touch, they don't quite realize
[56:20.920 --> 56:22.240]  that it's not going to work.
[56:22.240 --> 56:24.400]  In 2007, at the beginning of the EDL,
[56:24.400 --> 56:26.080]  when Tommy was starting out,
[56:26.080 --> 56:29.440]  they used to use these very tactics,
[56:29.440 --> 56:31.200]  they used to silence him, they used to throw him in jail,
[56:31.200 --> 56:33.040]  and no one knew about it, there wasn't the internet,
[56:33.040 --> 56:35.440]  there wasn't social media, there was no one to cause outrage,
[56:35.440 --> 56:37.200]  you do have pressed blackout,
[56:37.200 --> 56:38.600]  and nobody knows what's going on.
[56:38.600 --> 56:42.160]  Now, they do not realize what they have done.
[56:42.160 --> 56:45.440]  In fact, if they would have put this pressed blackout,
[56:45.440 --> 56:47.240]  maybe not as many people would have known about this
[56:47.240 --> 56:48.680]  because it caused such a scandal,
[56:48.680 --> 56:50.360]  they're so out of touch, they don't realize
[56:50.360 --> 56:52.200]  how this is going to erupt,
[56:52.200 --> 56:54.200]  and how this is going to completely fail.
[56:54.200 --> 56:56.760]  This is, it's unprecedented.
[56:56.760 --> 56:59.600]  So it's fair to say, I think you could mark this point
[56:59.600 --> 57:03.480]  as the beginning of the real explosion,
[57:03.480 --> 57:05.000]  the pushback against what's happening.
[57:05.000 --> 57:07.480]  They've jumped the metaphorical shark here
[57:07.480 --> 57:09.880]  by folks know that these massive grooming scandals
[57:09.880 --> 57:11.040]  are happening in every city,
[57:11.040 --> 57:13.520]  they know Muslims and pedos are above the law,
[57:13.520 --> 57:15.600]  and folks are angry across the board.
[57:17.040 --> 57:17.880]  Oh yes, of course they do.
[57:17.880 --> 57:19.480]  I mean, a lot of people in this country,
[57:19.480 --> 57:21.160]  millions of people have known this is going on for ages,
[57:21.160 --> 57:23.160]  this is why we had Brexit, this is why in America,
[57:23.160 --> 57:25.480]  you had Trump, we knew that the establishment
[57:25.480 --> 57:27.840]  was covering up cases since Hillsborough,
[57:27.840 --> 57:30.080]  and since before then, it's been proven.
[57:30.080 --> 57:32.240]  Taylor Robertson, you're a hero as well
[57:32.240 --> 57:34.040]  with Tommy the Antifa attacking you guys,
[57:34.040 --> 57:35.720]  stay there back in two minutes,
[57:35.720 --> 57:37.240]  we're going to do a few more segments with you,
[57:37.240 --> 57:40.160]  amazing, tommyrobsononline.com,
[57:40.160 --> 57:41.520]  go there, make donations,
[57:41.520 --> 57:43.080]  we've also made big donations,
[57:43.080 --> 57:45.040]  I did 20 grand a few months ago,
[57:45.040 --> 57:46.200]  that's why I need you to buy the products
[57:46.200 --> 57:48.120]  at infowarstore.com.
[57:48.120 --> 57:51.160]  Western Europe has already banned free speech,
[57:51.160 --> 57:53.120]  and an iron curtain of censorship
[57:53.120 --> 57:55.760]  is descending down over the UK.
[57:55.760 --> 57:58.640]  They're set to pass rules, not a law,
[57:58.640 --> 58:01.280]  that if you criticize Islam or gays,
[58:01.280 --> 58:03.640]  you'll get six months in prison.
[58:03.640 --> 58:05.520]  We know we're only about a year or two
[58:05.520 --> 58:07.320]  behind what's happening in the UK.
[58:07.320 --> 58:09.480]  CNN and many others are calling for info wars
[58:09.480 --> 58:11.880]  to be shut down, taken off the web.
[58:11.880 --> 58:14.760]  Slate magazine has a professor and others saying,
[58:14.760 --> 58:17.960]  go beyond censorship, brainwash young people
[58:17.960 --> 58:20.920]  against info wars, psychologically inoculate them
[58:20.920 --> 58:24.080]  with lies so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[58:24.080 --> 58:26.440]  We are the most hated news source in the world

[59:46.560 --> 1:00:12.560]  Join the fight for freedom.
[1:00:12.560 --> 1:00:23.920]  It is very surreal when I got married last year without even asking Donald Trump got
[1:00:23.920 --> 1:00:26.320]  my wife's number and called her.
[1:00:26.320 --> 1:00:31.360]  But let me tell you, it's surreal when you come up with things like Hillary for Prison
[1:00:31.360 --> 1:00:33.680]  locker up to see that slogan.
[1:00:33.680 --> 1:00:37.160]  It's surreal to see our successes because of you, the audience taking action.
[1:00:37.160 --> 1:00:38.320]  It's all you.
[1:00:38.320 --> 1:00:42.160]  I get the treat of having George Soros and Hillary come after me, but quite frankly that
[1:00:42.160 --> 1:00:45.800]  is retreat because it means I'm doing something, I'm a man, I don't like to go through these
[1:00:45.800 --> 1:00:47.320]  tribulations but it's got to be done.
[1:00:47.320 --> 1:00:53.160]  I look at Tommy Robinson and how they tried to kill him with bleach in prison and all
[1:00:53.160 --> 1:00:57.480]  he went through and losing his house and his tanning salon just because he saw kids
[1:00:57.480 --> 1:01:03.160]  being run out of a kebab shop next door and it actually makes me get tears in my eyes
[1:01:03.160 --> 1:01:06.680]  that he hadn't gotten more support but I think they went over the line because it was Tommy
[1:01:06.680 --> 1:01:10.260]  that first exposed it, Tommy that went to prison twice for it, Tommy that didn't even
[1:01:10.260 --> 1:01:15.080]  break their fake rule and now saying no one can report on him disappearing, that is like,
[1:01:15.080 --> 1:01:18.200]  that is beyond the stuff we hear about in old Russia.
[1:01:18.200 --> 1:01:22.080]  Short segment here, another segment coming up in Roger Stone, but Kalen, Robertson, I'm
[1:01:22.080 --> 1:01:23.960]  not kissing your butt here, it's true.
[1:01:23.960 --> 1:01:28.600]  You guys get attacked by anti-fub when the police stand down, the things you do for free
[1:01:28.600 --> 1:01:35.240]  speech worldwide, the examples you and what Judy Brown or is it Julie Brown, I don't have
[1:01:35.240 --> 1:01:36.240]  a teleprompter.
[1:01:36.240 --> 1:01:39.840]  What you guys are doing is historic.
[1:01:39.840 --> 1:01:44.600]  Thank you so much, it's really kind to hear things like that, there are people who go
[1:01:44.600 --> 1:01:48.360]  to war and who join the military and have their limbs blown off and things like that
[1:01:48.360 --> 1:01:54.200]  and I find that far more incredible than anything that we would be doing in terms of fear and
[1:01:54.200 --> 1:01:55.200]  things like that.
[1:01:55.200 --> 1:01:58.680]  I don't see how more people are doing it, this is what I find really interesting, I don't
[1:01:58.680 --> 1:02:02.880]  see how more people wouldn't risk a cushy job or something like that to go out and speak
[1:02:02.880 --> 1:02:06.240]  out against us and try to join us.
[1:02:06.240 --> 1:02:10.560]  Let me say something on that, they've got studies in Europe, UK and here, and I'm not
[1:02:10.560 --> 1:02:13.840]  taking away from the world they're coming up to charging a machine gun nest and dying,
[1:02:13.840 --> 1:02:16.760]  but you're trained, you're in a group, it's a mission, you're empowered.
[1:02:16.760 --> 1:02:21.480]  When you're going against the media, the establishment and all of it and social constructs,
[1:02:21.480 --> 1:02:25.680]  shang no they found in studies is harder than charging machine gun nests.
[1:02:25.680 --> 1:02:29.240]  It's rarer than that when the whole social structure is against you.
[1:02:29.240 --> 1:02:32.800]  When the social structure says charge the machine gun nest, then get people to do it.
[1:02:32.800 --> 1:02:34.800]  Do you see what I'm saying?
[1:02:34.800 --> 1:02:39.120]  Well, slightly, there's lots of cars, there's lots of things going on, I can't really hear
[1:02:39.120 --> 1:02:43.480]  what you're saying, but sort of, I think you're talking about...
[1:02:43.480 --> 1:02:46.640]  Moral courage sometimes is harder than physical courage.
[1:02:46.640 --> 1:02:51.000]  Yes, it's very, very true.
[1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:54.640]  I think this whole thing is just basically a representation of a massive gap between
[1:02:54.640 --> 1:02:59.160]  people who have had things far too well for far too long and people who have basically
[1:02:59.160 --> 1:03:02.280]  been running the country, the working people of this country, people like Tommy, and there's
[1:03:02.280 --> 1:03:07.280]  this huge, huge gap of representation between them is what caused such a major resentment
[1:03:07.280 --> 1:03:13.280]  and what caused such a relaxed mentality that's sort of allowed all of this to happen.
[1:03:13.280 --> 1:03:16.680]  So it's quite hard to hear you because of all this chaos.
[1:03:16.680 --> 1:03:17.680]  You're doing a great job.
[1:03:17.680 --> 1:03:18.680]  Keep going.
[1:03:18.680 --> 1:03:19.680]  Yes.
[1:03:19.680 --> 1:03:20.680]  Well, there's always talking about...
[1:03:20.680 --> 1:03:22.000]  I got to know Tommy very well.
[1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:23.000]  I came from the left.
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:27.200]  I came from a very high-paying job, my partner was in the BBC, and we moved from that after
[1:03:27.200 --> 1:03:29.760]  we met Tommy and went for lunch and became really good friends with him.
[1:03:29.760 --> 1:03:33.240]  He told us about the EDL, he told us about the police corruption, he told us about every
[1:03:33.240 --> 1:03:38.200]  single time systematically that the police arrested him, raided his house with his wife
[1:03:38.200 --> 1:03:42.480]  and children, tried to scare him, intimidate him, tried to throw him under the bus and tried
[1:03:42.480 --> 1:03:43.480]  to silence him.
[1:03:43.480 --> 1:03:46.880]  And we said, and this is very interesting, we said that this would never happen again
[1:03:46.880 --> 1:03:47.880]  in the day of the internet.
[1:03:47.880 --> 1:03:52.000]  This would never, ever happen again when information could be freely shared and people would be
[1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:53.000]  able to galvanize.
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:56.520]  And that's what's so terrifying about this case is because they've done it again and
[1:03:56.520 --> 1:04:01.680]  they've almost succeeded because they've managed to create a media blackout.
[1:04:01.680 --> 1:04:04.920]  What's scary about this right now is that most of the people that I've been talking
[1:04:04.920 --> 1:04:08.960]  to, the feeling in the country, the people who know about this case, can't confirm it.
[1:04:08.960 --> 1:04:11.160]  They don't really know if he's actually in prison.
[1:04:11.160 --> 1:04:15.200]  They kind of know that he's been arrested, they kind of know that maybe it's kind of
[1:04:15.200 --> 1:04:19.880]  problematic and maybe he's been taken away, but they can't read any factual report to
[1:04:19.880 --> 1:04:20.880]  prove it's happened.
[1:04:20.880 --> 1:04:25.000]  And does it the establishment get that when you grab somebody who's a hero and then won't
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:30.000]  even let people know if he's in jail or prison when he is, that that is the essence of secret
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:35.200]  police and confirms the 1984 Orwellville has now finally come to London?
[1:04:35.200 --> 1:04:36.840]  Oh, yes, of course.
[1:04:36.840 --> 1:04:40.440]  Oh, I absolutely believe this is the last time this will ever happen again.
[1:04:40.440 --> 1:04:41.760]  There's no way that they can get with this again.
[1:04:41.760 --> 1:04:42.760]  I agree.
[1:04:42.760 --> 1:04:44.720]  Hey, listen, Kalen Stather, you're a hero.
[1:04:44.720 --> 1:04:45.720]  All you guys are.
[1:04:45.720 --> 1:04:49.160]  I'm going to talk about what you think is coming next from the street in London than
[1:04:49.160 --> 1:04:58.000]  Roger Stone with the biggest Mueller Russiagate news yet, wait till you hear this Facebook.
[1:04:58.000 --> 1:05:02.320]  After losing the presidential election in 2016, Hillary Clinton says she wants to be
[1:05:02.320 --> 1:05:06.400]  the next CEO of Facebook is the biggest news platform in the world.
[1:05:06.400 --> 1:05:08.840]  But how exactly would she run Facebook?
[1:05:08.840 --> 1:05:14.080]  If given the chance during the 2016 presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton campaign staffers
[1:05:14.080 --> 1:05:18.640]  were acting as assignment editors for the mainstream media by telling reporters what
[1:05:18.640 --> 1:05:21.480]  to cover and what to keep secret from the public.
[1:05:21.480 --> 1:05:26.000]  A batch of Clinton campaign emails released by WikiLeaks reveal that her staffers were
[1:05:26.000 --> 1:05:31.520]  directly working with mainstream journalists to develop new stories favorable to Clinton.
[1:05:31.520 --> 1:05:35.640]  The New York Times granted Hillary Clinton veto power over their articles.
[1:05:35.640 --> 1:05:40.480]  Politico's Glenn Thrush asked Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta to approve his story
[1:05:40.480 --> 1:05:42.120]  prior to publication.
[1:05:42.120 --> 1:05:46.040]  And another email shows the campaign was given the heads up on a story coming out of the
[1:05:46.040 --> 1:05:50.000]  Wall Street Journal so that the campaign would have the opportunity to push back.
[1:05:50.000 --> 1:06:16.560]  Clinton was effectively the editor-in-chief of the mainstream media, Lee and MacadooInfoWars.com.
[1:06:16.560 --> 1:06:28.400]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[1:06:28.400 --> 1:06:36.360]  We're talking to Katelyn Robertson, an amazing filmmaker, journalist, researcher who was
[1:06:36.360 --> 1:06:40.000]  kicked out of college, even though he was a successful journalist, for just being mildly
[1:06:40.000 --> 1:06:41.000]  critical of Islam.
[1:06:41.000 --> 1:06:44.000]  He's been working with Tommy Robinson for over a year and a half, I've had him on many
[1:06:44.000 --> 1:06:51.640]  times, he is on the street in London after huge protests all over the city, almost total
[1:06:51.640 --> 1:06:54.560]  news blackout, an order to not cover that he's in prison.
[1:06:54.560 --> 1:06:57.560]  The average Brits are everywhere, he says even liberals, you name it, if you just joined
[1:06:57.560 --> 1:07:00.520]  us, are saying, where's Tommy, is he really in prison?
[1:07:00.520 --> 1:07:04.260]  Because the media won't report, he is in prison, he's talked to him in prison.
[1:07:04.260 --> 1:07:09.080]  He can talk about that, but not why he's in prison, but I'm in the U.S. I can tell you,
[1:07:09.080 --> 1:07:15.280]  Fox News talked to the lawyer, talked to others on condition of anonymity, and they admit
[1:07:15.280 --> 1:07:20.120]  in the Fox News article on Infowars.com, we've got even more backstory, but Fox is confirming
[1:07:20.120 --> 1:07:25.600]  this, that they've told thousands of journalist groups she'll be put in jail too if you talk
[1:07:25.600 --> 1:07:28.360]  about Tommy being arrested, period.
[1:07:28.360 --> 1:07:33.440]  Now that has finally gotten people to click out of where they're at, Tommy Robinson, the
[1:07:33.440 --> 1:07:37.640]  activist that first exposed the giant child kidnapping rings with the Muslims, who was
[1:07:37.640 --> 1:07:38.880]  put in prison for it.
[1:07:38.880 --> 1:07:43.960]  It's now all over the news, they're confirmed, but they've now put him in jail for it.
[1:07:43.960 --> 1:07:44.960]  This is unbelievable.
[1:07:44.960 --> 1:07:50.120]  So, Kalen Robinson, you're on fire, in the eight minutes we have, lay out what you can
[1:07:50.120 --> 1:07:54.960]  say about Tommy, you're his contact, what he's saying, how he's doing, what you witnessed,
[1:07:54.960 --> 1:07:57.760]  where this is going, the huge awakening you've witnessed.
[1:07:57.760 --> 1:08:03.320]  Okay, well, we obviously arrived in Leeds to cover a grooming scandal of 29 men who
[1:08:03.320 --> 1:08:05.400]  had groomed hundreds of women.
[1:08:05.400 --> 1:08:07.640]  There was no evidence of any reporting restriction on it.
[1:08:07.640 --> 1:08:12.480]  We read out simply facts from a reputable credible newspaper, we read out the allegations,
[1:08:12.480 --> 1:08:15.680]  we used the word alleged, there was nothing unlawful at all.
[1:08:15.680 --> 1:08:20.440]  We had done all the research beforehand, all of it, it wasn't a content of court thing,
[1:08:20.440 --> 1:08:23.440]  it wasn't, we weren't releasing information about the case, that could jeopardize it,
[1:08:23.440 --> 1:08:26.320]  or that wasn't already publicly available in the local newspaper.
[1:08:26.320 --> 1:08:30.440]  So we just decided to go out there and read out those charges and video the people who
[1:08:30.440 --> 1:08:32.800]  were, who were the defendants who were going in.
[1:08:32.800 --> 1:08:35.480]  Those people have already had videos taken of them and already had pictures taken of
[1:08:35.480 --> 1:08:37.680]  them, so we weren't releasing anything new.
[1:08:37.680 --> 1:08:42.240]  The police immediately arrived, nine of them, walked outside a car, arrested him, took him
[1:08:42.240 --> 1:08:46.000]  to a prison, told us that it was for breach of the peace.
[1:08:46.000 --> 1:08:48.520]  Very strange, given that it's one man with a phone.
[1:08:48.520 --> 1:08:53.520]  We went to the prison cell where he was being kept up, they said, he's been released, he's
[1:08:53.520 --> 1:08:54.520]  not here anymore.
[1:08:54.520 --> 1:08:59.520]  And then we found out that he's been taken to, taken to the court, and then the court
[1:08:59.520 --> 1:09:05.880]  process started, and for tyrannical law reasons, I can't tell you what happened in that courtroom.
[1:09:05.880 --> 1:09:10.480]  It was, I don't know if this is legal or not, but it was, it was minutes long, it was three
[1:09:10.480 --> 1:09:12.840]  or four minutes long in that courtroom.
[1:09:12.840 --> 1:09:17.960]  There was no bail, there was no back and forth argument, there was no proper defense, it
[1:09:17.960 --> 1:09:23.080]  was minutes, and then it was taken away, gone, straight to prison, no chance of bail, no
[1:09:23.080 --> 1:09:25.960]  chance of leaving, that's it, that's it, blackout, and then the press couldn't talk
[1:09:25.960 --> 1:09:26.960]  about it.
[1:09:26.960 --> 1:09:30.680]  The journalists who were in that room closed their notepads as soon as they realized they
[1:09:30.680 --> 1:09:33.520]  were the press restriction, and they went home and they didn't talk about it, and that
[1:09:33.520 --> 1:09:34.520]  was it.
[1:09:34.520 --> 1:09:37.800]  And they thought it was silenced, and that's where we're at now, and now we're in a situation
[1:09:37.800 --> 1:09:40.720]  where hundreds of thousands of people in this country are going out and protesting,
[1:09:40.720 --> 1:09:45.440]  and they're furious, and people who I never expected to be talking, who are from the left-wing
[1:09:45.440 --> 1:09:48.160]  media are saying that they've never seen anything like this before, they've never seen anger
[1:09:48.160 --> 1:09:52.880]  like this before, they're worried about the whole country being burned down, and people
[1:09:52.880 --> 1:09:56.560]  have to go to the US to, fortunately, have the First Amendment to read the information
[1:09:56.560 --> 1:10:00.760]  about this, they have to go to IMFOR, they have to go to Fox News, and they're losing
[1:10:00.760 --> 1:10:05.280]  their minds, everybody is losing their minds, they can't comprehend that this is happening
[1:10:05.280 --> 1:10:09.920]  in a first world democratic country.
[1:10:09.920 --> 1:10:13.640]  And that's all I can report on, I can't talk about the rest of the case, there's lots of
[1:10:13.640 --> 1:10:19.160]  things that happen in there that were ridiculous, but I can't reveal the information right now.
[1:10:19.160 --> 1:10:23.440]  So as soon as I do, as soon as I hear any more contact from Tommy, anything like that,
[1:10:23.440 --> 1:10:28.360]  I'll pass it through IMFOR wars, and we'll keep everything updated, but until then, the
[1:10:28.360 --> 1:10:33.080]  only thing I can provide between then and now is that he is safe, all accusations of
[1:10:33.080 --> 1:10:38.040]  him being assaulted are untrue, it's not a highly Islamified prison where he's staying,
[1:10:38.040 --> 1:10:41.560]  so he's safe, that's all I can talk about.
[1:10:41.560 --> 1:10:48.120]  Well, all I can say is, Kalen Robertson, this is like a movie, this is like Vita Vendetta,
[1:10:48.120 --> 1:10:52.680]  but it's real history, it has a Tiananmen Square feeling, where they're arresting all these
[1:10:52.680 --> 1:10:58.920]  thousands of people in Europe that criticize Islam, supreme courts in Finland and other
[1:10:58.920 --> 1:11:03.040]  areas are ruling that Muslim men can have sex with 10-year-old girls against their will.
[1:11:03.040 --> 1:11:08.680]  I mean, I'm reading this in mainline papers, defending it, and then I'm seeing Tommy who
[1:11:08.680 --> 1:11:16.680]  should be getting national awards from the queen for being put in prison exposing the
[1:11:16.680 --> 1:11:20.880]  very Muslim grooming deal in his town, where they've gone to prison, and of course the
[1:11:20.880 --> 1:11:26.760]  next level was, girls would disappear, girls would die, and instead, I mean, this guy gets
[1:11:26.760 --> 1:11:30.600]  attacked everywhere, they try to beat him up, he fights off like six, seven people himself,
[1:11:30.600 --> 1:11:35.920]  he's not even a big guy, talk about a lion, I mean, this is the real deal, and now his
[1:11:35.920 --> 1:11:39.120]  own lawyer I know is quoted in Fox, you were in the courtroom, can't get into it, poorly,
[1:11:39.120 --> 1:11:42.960]  the judge smiled and smirked, he was caught on footage outside looking out the window
[1:11:42.960 --> 1:11:47.320]  as Tommy was arrested smirking, I know you can't get into this, but can you just tell
[1:11:47.320 --> 1:11:55.040]  us if the judge was smirking when Tommy's lawyer said he'll be killed in prison?
[1:11:55.040 --> 1:12:02.440]  The judge did two things, when we were reporting outside, he, I can talk about this actually,
[1:12:02.440 --> 1:12:05.760]  he looked through the window of the top building and was staring down at us, and he was sort
[1:12:05.760 --> 1:12:10.440]  of smearing, and I think that's when he was smirking, I don't think that happened in the
[1:12:10.440 --> 1:12:12.440]  courtroom, but he was smirking and looking through the footage.
[1:12:12.440 --> 1:12:15.440]  Yes, somebody, I saw that on Twitter, I was trying to find it earlier, he's got a real
[1:12:15.440 --> 1:12:18.120]  sense for me, and you know what else I can say?
[1:12:18.120 --> 1:12:22.640]  I haven't mentioned this, about five minutes before the judge looked through that window
[1:12:22.640 --> 1:12:27.880]  at us, they defended the rape gangs were doing this and pointing at us and doing death threats
[1:12:27.880 --> 1:12:31.960]  to us on the street from the same window that the judge was smirking at us through five minutes
[1:12:31.960 --> 1:12:36.320]  before, I haven't reported this yet, and they were making death threats to us, and we reported
[1:12:36.320 --> 1:12:39.360]  it to the police, right as it happened, we said there are people in that room in the
[1:12:39.360 --> 1:12:43.600]  courtroom who are making death threats at us, and doing these sort of signals, and what
[1:12:43.600 --> 1:12:45.960]  are you going to do about it, if we did that, what would you do?
[1:12:45.960 --> 1:12:49.840]  And the police responded, well that would be a different situation, 100% true, I think
[1:12:49.840 --> 1:12:53.640]  there's actually a video clip of it, I need to go through all this.
[1:12:53.640 --> 1:12:56.720]  And then the judge looked through that same video, there's the picture, that's the same
[1:12:56.720 --> 1:12:59.320]  window that the defendants were making death threats through.
[1:12:59.320 --> 1:13:03.960]  Yeah, I blew it up on my big HD screen at my office, I've got a big HD screen at home,
[1:13:03.960 --> 1:13:08.320]  and he's smiling like the Joker, looking down out of the window at everybody, I don't know
[1:13:08.320 --> 1:13:11.520]  if the internet with his streaming, if he can be clear, but on an HD screen, you could
[1:13:11.520 --> 1:13:15.040]  pull it up with the pixels, and then I saw the video, you're talking about outside them
[1:13:15.040 --> 1:13:20.880]  saying, oh, if it wasn't Muslims, you'd be left alone, I mean, why are the Islamists
[1:13:20.880 --> 1:13:25.160]  all over Europe so protected, isn't it because they vote as a bloc, and a parliamentary government,
[1:13:25.160 --> 1:13:30.480]  and even 10% can win any election for anybody, isn't it that, and isn't it also that they're
[1:13:30.480 --> 1:13:33.680]  spending massive amounts of political money?
[1:13:33.680 --> 1:13:37.240]  Well there's a couple of reasons, I think the main reason is because we had a case a
[1:13:37.240 --> 1:13:42.440]  couple of years ago where there was a Muslim protest in a town, a couple of them decided
[1:13:42.440 --> 1:13:46.440]  to, sorry, I have to move on, people are moving, someone's moving me on here.
[1:13:46.440 --> 1:13:52.560]  We had to move, sorry, I have to move down here because someone's banging that and making
[1:13:52.560 --> 1:13:53.560]  noise.
[1:13:53.560 --> 1:13:57.960]  There was a Muslim man who was arrested for hitting a police officer over the head with
[1:13:57.960 --> 1:14:03.720]  a brick, he then went to the police station where he was being held, the Iman came to
[1:14:03.720 --> 1:14:08.920]  that police station and said, if you do not release our man, then we will have thousands
[1:14:08.920 --> 1:14:13.040]  of Muslim men out here in seconds, and the police released him.
[1:14:13.040 --> 1:14:17.640]  And what the problem is is that the Muslim population of this country are far more ready
[1:14:17.640 --> 1:14:22.880]  to riot and to cause mayhem and to cause massive disruption, and they have the support of the
[1:14:22.880 --> 1:14:27.680]  media, and they have the support of the politicians, and whatever they do basically controls the
[1:14:27.680 --> 1:14:30.000]  narrative and controls the actions of the police.
[1:14:30.000 --> 1:14:34.040]  So they're absolutely terrified of saying anything wrong or doing anything wrong to
[1:14:34.040 --> 1:14:35.040]  them.
[1:14:35.040 --> 1:14:36.440]  We've seen it as evidence, we've seen it ourselves.
[1:14:36.440 --> 1:14:42.480]  I've had ex and current police officers tell me in this country, even recently, privately,
[1:14:42.480 --> 1:14:45.760]  that they know this is happening, can't release their information.
[1:14:45.760 --> 1:14:52.480]  And that's why they're terrified of doing any wrong do to the Muslim population.
[1:14:52.480 --> 1:14:56.720]  And that's why we don't see press restrictions on the other side, we don't see press restrictions
[1:14:56.720 --> 1:15:01.160]  for someone like Rolf Harris, even though these people got found guilty and things like
[1:15:01.160 --> 1:15:02.160]  that.
[1:15:02.160 --> 1:15:06.120]  But in the pre-trials, we didn't see any press restrictions like that, and that's why
[1:15:06.120 --> 1:15:12.000]  they're so much more protected than Tommy, because the police know that the government,
[1:15:12.000 --> 1:15:16.680]  the politicians, and anybody in power has them on site, because they know that they'll
[1:15:16.680 --> 1:15:17.680]  go up and they'll go right.
[1:15:17.680 --> 1:15:20.960]  And the Muslims are 1.8 billion, about to be 3 billion in 10 years.
[1:15:20.960 --> 1:15:25.680]  They are the future, and so they are the new God, and they will riot, and they will kill,
[1:15:25.680 --> 1:15:27.920]  and they will attack, and the Brits are all polite and nice.
[1:15:27.920 --> 1:15:29.120]  Yes, sir, yes, sir, yes, sir.
[1:15:29.120 --> 1:15:33.320]  But finally, we see that fire waking up, what we saw yesterday.
[1:15:33.320 --> 1:15:35.320]  Kailin, do you agree?
[1:15:35.320 --> 1:15:38.240]  Oh, it's shocking.
[1:15:38.240 --> 1:15:43.120]  The people who have told me how this country is feeling right now is absolutely insane.
[1:15:43.120 --> 1:15:44.120]  People are completely...
[1:15:44.120 --> 1:15:48.000]  Kailin Robertson, stay there, I gotta do one more minute than Roger Stone, because I want
[1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:53.680]  to tell people how they can donate when we come back, infowars.com, tommyrobbinsononline.com.

[1:20:10.440 --> 1:20:12.760]  Waging war on corruption.
[1:20:12.760 --> 1:20:19.680]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[1:20:19.680 --> 1:20:28.560]  Alright, finishing up with Taylan Robertson who's more than just the camera person and
[1:20:28.560 --> 1:20:31.800]  editor, he's the webmaster guy, he's the guy behind it.
[1:20:31.800 --> 1:20:36.520]  So much of getting Tommy out there the last year and a half as you've seen Tommy explode
[1:20:36.520 --> 1:20:37.720]  now that he has the infrastructure.
[1:20:37.720 --> 1:20:40.760]  That's why I sent him 20 grand to buy cameras and better editing equipment just so they
[1:20:40.760 --> 1:20:43.840]  could do better when Antifa was smashing their equipment.
[1:20:43.840 --> 1:20:48.880]  Just finishing up, Taylan, you were on fire during that break talking about the singularity
[1:20:48.880 --> 1:20:51.400]  happening in the UK, in Italy.
[1:20:51.400 --> 1:20:52.400]  What's coming next?
[1:20:52.400 --> 1:20:54.000]  And you're the contact.
[1:20:54.000 --> 1:20:58.840]  Your conversations with Tommy, where he is, how he's doing.
[1:20:58.840 --> 1:21:03.800]  So firstly about Tommy directly just to clear that up, we do have direct contact with him.
[1:21:03.800 --> 1:21:04.800]  He is safe.
[1:21:04.800 --> 1:21:08.560]  All the rumors about him being assaulted and things like that are not true.
[1:21:08.560 --> 1:21:12.440]  He's actually fortunately in a prison that isn't highly Islamic that has lots of people
[1:21:12.440 --> 1:21:15.040]  that fortunately support him.
[1:21:15.040 --> 1:21:17.120]  So that's something that can be put to rest that's really good.
[1:21:17.120 --> 1:21:20.680]  If anything else happens, obviously we'll release that straight away.
[1:21:20.680 --> 1:21:26.080]  And then the second point, which you're talking about, there is a massive, massive number
[1:21:26.080 --> 1:21:30.360]  of people in this country right now who are from the political establishment, who have
[1:21:30.360 --> 1:21:33.680]  been within that for years, who are within the media and who are very, very well known
[1:21:33.680 --> 1:21:41.240]  and influential, who are waiting to be pulled together, to fight against all of this.
[1:21:41.240 --> 1:21:42.240]  They're all waiting.
[1:21:42.240 --> 1:21:43.240]  I've spoken to them today.
[1:21:43.240 --> 1:21:45.240]  I've spoken to them all throughout the case.
[1:21:45.240 --> 1:21:46.240]  They're waiting for a nucleus.
[1:21:46.240 --> 1:21:50.560]  I've had some of the top figures over there call me and say, how do we bring it together?
[1:21:50.560 --> 1:21:55.400]  So they're looking for that TV network, that command base.
[1:21:55.400 --> 1:21:56.400]  Keep going.
[1:21:56.400 --> 1:22:00.320]  They're looking for King Arthur to pull the sword from the stone, and then they're all
[1:22:00.320 --> 1:22:01.560]  going to join in Galvanize.
[1:22:01.560 --> 1:22:05.080]  They're waiting for that first person, that first thing, that first event so that they
[1:22:05.080 --> 1:22:06.320]  can all rise up and do it.
[1:22:06.320 --> 1:22:10.160]  Unfortunately, in Britain, everyone's a little bit complacent, everyone's a little bit to
[1:22:10.160 --> 1:22:11.160]  the side.
[1:22:11.160 --> 1:22:12.160]  So no one really wants to do it first.
[1:22:12.160 --> 1:22:13.160]  I don't think it's that.
[1:22:13.160 --> 1:22:14.160]  I mean, I think more of it.
[1:22:14.160 --> 1:22:15.160]  I mean, you live there, you know better than I have, but I've been there many times.
[1:22:15.160 --> 1:22:19.080]  I think it's more of it not trying to be arrogant or grandstanding, but I think even
[1:22:19.080 --> 1:22:23.280]  though organizationally, the stone hasn't been pulled, the sword hasn't been pulled.
[1:22:23.280 --> 1:22:30.160]  Don't you think Tommy with this event, them coming after him this way has pulled the sword?
[1:22:30.160 --> 1:22:31.160]  Just about.
[1:22:31.160 --> 1:22:32.560]  It's about 90% of the way out.
[1:22:32.560 --> 1:22:34.920]  It's about something else is about to happen.
[1:22:34.920 --> 1:22:40.000]  The energy, the electricity across Europe, across the establishment, across the media,
[1:22:40.000 --> 1:22:41.240]  it's just about to happen.
[1:22:41.240 --> 1:22:48.240]  It's just on the cusp of everybody coming out onto the streets and everybody's coming
[1:22:48.240 --> 1:22:49.400]  together and supporting this.
[1:22:49.400 --> 1:22:53.600]  There's just some something we'll push it over and I think it's just a little bit more
[1:22:53.600 --> 1:22:54.600]  time.
[1:22:54.600 --> 1:22:59.200]  The reason we're waiting is because it's because there's a press ban and nobody can really
[1:22:59.200 --> 1:23:02.360]  confirm if this is true or not, unless it's they're watching, you know, info wars and
[1:23:02.360 --> 1:23:03.360]  Fox.
[1:23:03.360 --> 1:23:06.200]  Or they're watching the biggest website, second biggest site in the world, but technically
[1:23:06.200 --> 1:23:10.360]  the biggest site, the largest news site in the world now has is his top banner anti-immigration
[1:23:10.360 --> 1:23:11.920]  protestors held in London.
[1:23:11.920 --> 1:23:19.760]  Orange orders press blackout, Robinson silenced, so, but we have Robert's son on with us right
[1:23:19.760 --> 1:23:20.760]  now.
[1:23:20.760 --> 1:23:22.640]  Kailin, we'll talk to you again the next few days.
[1:23:22.640 --> 1:23:23.640]  Godspeed.
[1:23:23.640 --> 1:23:29.080]  Everybody can go to Tommy Robinson online.com to donate or to find the latest or info wars.com.
[1:23:29.080 --> 1:23:30.080]  Thank you so much, sir.
[1:23:30.080 --> 1:23:32.200]  Thanks for having me speak soon.
[1:23:32.200 --> 1:23:33.200]  Just briefly.
[1:23:33.200 --> 1:23:34.200]  I asked this question.
[1:23:34.200 --> 1:23:36.360]  People want to know how this keeps pouring in.
[1:23:36.360 --> 1:23:38.440]  What else is Tommy telling you that you can say on air?
[1:23:38.440 --> 1:23:41.880]  I know there's this totalitarian North Korean blackout, but what else has he said to you?
[1:23:41.880 --> 1:23:47.000]  We have seconds on the phone, so I'll know more stuff in the next couple of days, but
[1:23:47.000 --> 1:23:52.240]  the main information now is just that he's safe and that he's happy for us to to to proceed
[1:23:52.240 --> 1:23:53.240]  a legal battle.
[1:23:53.240 --> 1:23:55.280]  Does he know how big all this is?
[1:23:55.280 --> 1:23:56.280]  Nope.
[1:23:56.280 --> 1:23:57.280]  He has no idea.
[1:23:57.280 --> 1:23:58.280]  But there's no time to tell him.
[1:23:58.280 --> 1:23:59.680]  It's we have seconds on the phone.
[1:23:59.680 --> 1:24:00.680]  There's no time to tell him.
[1:24:00.680 --> 1:24:03.320]  He has no idea what's going on right now in the outside world.
[1:24:03.320 --> 1:24:05.320]  He has no idea.
[1:24:05.320 --> 1:24:06.320]  That's right.
[1:24:06.320 --> 1:24:07.320]  I remember you going to UK prison.
[1:24:07.320 --> 1:24:10.680]  You don't get to talk to family for eight days and that you're only allowed 30 second
[1:24:10.680 --> 1:24:11.680]  phone calls.
[1:24:11.680 --> 1:24:12.680]  You went to look at Wikipedia.
[1:24:12.680 --> 1:24:13.680]  Is that accurate?
[1:24:13.680 --> 1:24:15.680]  Well, it depends on the prison.
[1:24:15.680 --> 1:24:16.680]  Some of them are very cushy.
[1:24:16.680 --> 1:24:20.600]  Some some of them you're allowed phones and internet, but this one isn't obviously you
[1:24:20.600 --> 1:24:21.600]  won't have.
[1:24:21.600 --> 1:24:23.800]  Caitlin, thank you so much.
[1:24:23.800 --> 1:24:24.800]  Thanks.
[1:24:24.800 --> 1:24:25.800]  Speak soon.
[1:24:25.800 --> 1:24:26.800]  Wow.
[1:24:26.800 --> 1:24:30.160]  I mean, I'm totally blown away and thank God Drudge Report cares about this.
[1:24:30.160 --> 1:24:33.160]  Thank God Fox News at least has an article or two.
[1:24:33.160 --> 1:24:35.280]  Thank God in full wars.com is there.
[1:24:35.280 --> 1:24:37.560]  Got a drug report.com.
[1:24:37.560 --> 1:24:38.560]  That is beautiful.
[1:24:38.560 --> 1:24:44.000]  Drudge right now, ladies and gentlemen, is what's happening and that there's a news blackout.
[1:24:44.000 --> 1:24:49.680]  You're arrested that that poor guy who we've had on probably 10 times before, Caitlin,
[1:24:49.680 --> 1:24:52.400]  could not even tell us what was going on during the break.
[1:24:52.400 --> 1:24:56.040]  I was trying to get stuff and he was scared to do it because they'll throw your butt in
[1:24:56.040 --> 1:25:01.680]  prison.
[1:25:01.680 --> 1:25:06.520]  Live feeds up on info wars.com news wars.com news wars.com.
[1:25:06.520 --> 1:25:08.520]  You're able to actually tweet that they're blocking info wars.
[1:25:08.520 --> 1:25:10.400]  You can tweet it with a shadow ban.
[1:25:10.400 --> 1:25:11.400]  Roger Stone.
[1:25:11.400 --> 1:25:14.760]  I'm going to let Roger, he didn't know this was happening, but it's about to happen.
[1:25:14.760 --> 1:25:18.600]  Roger Stone is going to host the rest of the show now, not because I don't want to be here,
[1:25:18.600 --> 1:25:21.960]  but because I won't shut up if I don't leave.
[1:25:21.960 --> 1:25:26.400]  I talked to Roger 10 minutes this morning, 30 minutes this afternoon, 20 minutes driving.
[1:25:26.400 --> 1:25:35.040]  I probably talked to Roger an hour today and I really think it's best if I just stop the
[1:25:35.040 --> 1:25:41.920]  broadcast myself, stop right now and let Roger take over on the other side for two segments
[1:25:41.920 --> 1:25:42.920]  and then I'll be back tomorrow.
[1:25:42.920 --> 1:25:43.920]  11 a.m. Central.
[1:25:43.920 --> 1:25:45.480]  We'll have live feeds all of it as well.
[1:25:45.480 --> 1:25:50.080]  So we had a rebroadcast set tomorrow, but I'll probably end up doing some of it live.
[1:25:50.080 --> 1:25:53.680]  History's happening because here's the problem.
[1:25:53.680 --> 1:25:54.680]  Some of it's on record.
[1:25:54.680 --> 1:25:55.680]  Some of it's off record.
[1:25:55.680 --> 1:25:58.960]  I was writing notes while he did it, but I don't want to get it wrong.
[1:25:58.960 --> 1:26:00.520]  I know a lot of inside baseball.
[1:26:00.520 --> 1:26:02.760]  I know the stuff they're doing to me.
[1:26:02.760 --> 1:26:08.240]  It's now 12 people that Rogers talked to that they keep obsessing on yours truly.
[1:26:08.240 --> 1:26:10.320]  It's all about his personal life.
[1:26:10.320 --> 1:26:11.320]  They want him to flip.
[1:26:11.320 --> 1:26:14.240]  They've even sent messages in the media, flip, flip on the president.
[1:26:14.240 --> 1:26:16.200]  There's nothing to flip on.
[1:26:16.200 --> 1:26:20.480]  So they'll try to find somebody in his entourage that they can find something on to say, we're
[1:26:20.480 --> 1:26:25.600]  going to put you in prison if you don't flip on stone, then if stone doesn't flip on Trump,
[1:26:25.600 --> 1:26:26.600]  that will happen.
[1:26:26.600 --> 1:26:29.640]  But the problem is that there's nothing on Trump.
[1:26:29.640 --> 1:26:30.640]  None of it's true.
[1:26:30.640 --> 1:26:33.920]  And I know the whole inside baseball, it's not that I'm scared of Mueller.
[1:26:33.920 --> 1:26:40.400]  I just have to talk so much to Roger and I have these notes here, but I'm not even sure
[1:26:40.400 --> 1:26:41.920]  that I can go over these accurately.
[1:26:41.920 --> 1:26:44.080]  So I'm going to give him the floor in the next two segments.
[1:26:44.080 --> 1:26:48.480]  Know this though, pedophiles run the New World Order.
[1:26:48.480 --> 1:26:50.840]  It's all coming out massive unprecedented arrests.
[1:26:50.840 --> 1:26:54.920]  The deputy pub has been arrested, a secret trial in Melbourne, Australia, over a hundred
[1:26:54.920 --> 1:27:00.240]  traffic kids reportedly, giant child kidnapping rings, dead bodies being dug up all over England.
[1:27:00.240 --> 1:27:01.240]  It's massive news.
[1:27:01.240 --> 1:27:04.800]  Now, secret trials, arrest of journalists that first reported it.
[1:27:04.800 --> 1:27:06.760]  It's secret that they've been arrested.
[1:27:06.760 --> 1:27:09.280]  This is happening.
[1:27:09.280 --> 1:27:12.480]  And I've been threatened this year and last year.
[1:27:12.480 --> 1:27:15.200]  You leave Islam, radical Islam alone.
[1:27:15.200 --> 1:27:17.800]  You leave the pedophile rings alone.
[1:27:17.800 --> 1:27:19.920]  You leave George Sorrell's alone and we're going to destroy you.
[1:27:19.920 --> 1:27:23.880]  And every time they up the ante, they are delivering on what they said, I will do this
[1:27:23.880 --> 1:27:25.920]  until I die.
[1:27:25.920 --> 1:27:29.040]  Not because I'm a hero, but because I cannot turn things over to these people.
[1:27:29.040 --> 1:27:32.240]  But I want listeners understand something.
[1:27:32.240 --> 1:27:33.240]  This is not a game.
[1:27:33.240 --> 1:27:34.240]  This is not a joke.
[1:27:34.240 --> 1:27:37.120]  This is not a drill.

[1:28:28.520 --> 1:28:29.520]  when you do that.

[1:28:32.520 --> 1:28:37.600]  TV station you're listening to us or watching that changes the world and overrides the sensors
[1:28:37.600 --> 1:28:42.720]  and the control freaks and lets them know that they are being met on the field of battle.
[1:28:42.720 --> 1:28:47.920]  Straight ahead the biggest news yet in the Mueller investigation is they attempt to make
[1:28:47.920 --> 1:28:54.160]  Roger Stone lie about Trump as they let him know the frame up is ready.
[1:28:54.160 --> 1:28:56.160]  Stay with us.
[1:28:56.160 --> 1:29:01.680]  Western Europe has already banned free speech and an iron curtain of censorship is descending
[1:29:01.680 --> 1:29:03.800]  down over the UK.
[1:29:03.800 --> 1:29:10.080]  They're set to pass rules not a law that if you criticize Islam or gays you'll get six
[1:29:10.080 --> 1:29:11.640]  months in prison.
[1:29:11.640 --> 1:29:15.400]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[1:29:15.400 --> 1:29:20.200]  Singing in and many others are calling for info wars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[1:29:20.200 --> 1:29:25.080]  Slate magazine has a professor and others saying go beyond censorship, brainwash young
[1:29:25.080 --> 1:29:30.720]  people against info wars, psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear
[1:29:30.720 --> 1:29:32.040]  what we have to say.
[1:29:32.040 --> 1:29:35.040]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.

[1:30:57.720 --> 1:31:02.200]  Patrick in the great nation of Australia, you're on the air worldwide.
[1:31:02.200 --> 1:31:03.200]  Thanks for holding.
[1:31:03.200 --> 1:31:09.680]  I've been following you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now, I remember back when info wars
[1:31:09.680 --> 1:31:14.320]  and prison planet, it was just blue text on a white screen and they had to load down
[1:31:14.320 --> 1:31:18.320]  the page on my dial up internet and I thought it was pretty cool and read all the books
[1:31:18.320 --> 1:31:22.680]  and seen all the DVDs and followed all your guests and I've been using your product since
[1:31:22.680 --> 1:31:28.320]  the first iteration of survival shield and since then I'm on the X2, the super male vitality,
[1:31:28.320 --> 1:31:32.800]  the caveman, the real red pill, micro ZX biting, it's all amazing.
[1:31:32.800 --> 1:31:33.800]  Thank you brother.
[1:31:33.800 --> 1:31:38.440]  Yeah and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing
[1:31:38.440 --> 1:31:42.840]  the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit and it's just the more
[1:31:42.840 --> 1:31:47.960]  you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God and I wanted to say that
[1:31:47.960 --> 1:31:53.360]  it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew, and the listeners out there, 1776
[1:31:53.360 --> 1:31:54.360]  worldwide.
[1:31:54.360 --> 1:32:04.160]  One of the most incredible cups of coffee can be found in the high mountains of southern
[1:32:04.160 --> 1:32:09.280]  Mexico where the Chiapas farmers have spent years perfecting their techniques.
[1:32:09.280 --> 1:32:14.280]  Based off hundreds of years of traditional techniques and perfect conditions, we've
[1:32:14.280 --> 1:32:19.320]  sourced only the best to provide you with our immune support and wake up America, patriot
[1:32:19.320 --> 1:32:20.320]  blend coffee.

[1:33:00.400 --> 1:33:10.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:10.840 --> 1:33:17.880]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen right here on the Alex
[1:33:17.880 --> 1:33:19.440]  Jones show.
[1:33:19.440 --> 1:33:25.080]  And now your host, Roger Stone.
[1:33:25.080 --> 1:33:27.760]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:27.760 --> 1:33:28.760]  That's right.
[1:33:28.760 --> 1:33:29.760]  I'm Roger Stone.
[1:33:29.760 --> 1:33:36.080]  Well, it has become abundantly clear that having come up completely empty handed when
[1:33:36.080 --> 1:33:43.320]  it comes to Russian collusion on my part, having no evidence whatsoever that I received
[1:33:43.320 --> 1:33:49.720]  or trafficked in documents with WikiLeaks or Julian Assange, having no evidence that
[1:33:49.720 --> 1:33:56.680]  I ridiculously knew about the publication of John Podesta's emails in advance, it is
[1:33:56.680 --> 1:34:04.440]  now abundantly clear that special counsel Robert Mueller intends to frame me on some
[1:34:04.440 --> 1:34:12.840]  conjured up concocted offense in an effort to leverage my testimony against the president
[1:34:12.840 --> 1:34:15.960]  of the United States.
[1:34:15.960 --> 1:34:23.600]  Politico reported this week that that was the intention of the Mueller thrust.
[1:34:23.600 --> 1:34:32.200]  Now at least 12 of my current or former associates have been vigorously interrogated by Mueller
[1:34:32.200 --> 1:34:36.760]  or his FBI representatives.
[1:34:36.760 --> 1:34:44.640]  And those questions are extraordinarily invasive in that they go far beyond politics into my
[1:34:44.640 --> 1:34:46.520]  personal finances.
[1:34:46.520 --> 1:34:52.280]  You'll notice that that story was leaked to CNN by the special counsel.
[1:34:52.280 --> 1:35:01.640]  My taxes, presumably, my bank accounts, my political activities, and every single molecule
[1:35:01.640 --> 1:35:04.400]  of my personal life.
[1:35:04.400 --> 1:35:08.740]  This is by any definition a vendetta.
[1:35:08.740 --> 1:35:17.160]  This is a witch hunt, but it has a specific purpose beyond silencing and bankrupting the
[1:35:17.160 --> 1:35:19.060]  Stone family.
[1:35:19.060 --> 1:35:22.200]  They want me to roll on the big man.
[1:35:22.200 --> 1:35:28.600]  They want me to bear false witness against President Donald J. Trump.
[1:35:28.600 --> 1:35:35.520]  Now I don't know what Michael Cohn will choose to do, but I know what I will do.
[1:35:35.520 --> 1:35:37.400]  That will never happen.
[1:35:37.400 --> 1:35:39.840]  I have this president's back.
[1:35:39.840 --> 1:35:47.280]  I will not betray him no matter what kind of bogus charges they trump up or the expression
[1:35:47.280 --> 1:35:49.160]  against me.
[1:35:49.160 --> 1:35:54.920]  That's because Donald Trump is bringing real change and he's doing it quickly.
[1:35:54.920 --> 1:36:01.680]  On the other hand, I understand the extraordinary power of a runaway federal prosecutor who
[1:36:01.680 --> 1:36:07.280]  literally can go through your personal and business and financial records and make two
[1:36:07.280 --> 1:36:10.360]  and two equal six.
[1:36:10.360 --> 1:36:12.840]  This is called the frame up.
[1:36:12.840 --> 1:36:18.600]  Alan Dershowitz has written that the average American inadvertently commits three felonies
[1:36:18.600 --> 1:36:19.800]  a day.
[1:36:19.800 --> 1:36:25.240]  I know that there's an intense focus on my independent political activities because
[1:36:25.240 --> 1:36:34.040]  I had a hand in the production of the terrific movie Banished, the Danny Williams story,
[1:36:34.040 --> 1:36:43.520]  using modern technology to ensure that 38,000 American voters saw that devastating documentary.
[1:36:43.520 --> 1:36:50.720]  Also the song, The Ballad of Danny Williams by the Freenauts, you can see both of these
[1:36:50.720 --> 1:36:51.720]  at YouTube.
[1:36:51.720 --> 1:36:58.720]  Yes, I raised hundreds of thousands of dollars to ensure that literally millions of voters
[1:36:58.720 --> 1:37:00.680]  saw those important videos.
[1:37:00.680 --> 1:37:06.920]  Then there was that stop the steal operation where we took steps to examine the election
[1:37:06.920 --> 1:37:13.000]  of non-Trump candidates in a half dozen states where the Republican establishment was stealing
[1:37:13.000 --> 1:37:19.980]  in preparation for an attempt at the Republican National Convention to hijack the nomination.
[1:37:19.980 --> 1:37:26.760]  Even though Donald Trump had run the tables in caucuses and primaries and state conventions,
[1:37:26.760 --> 1:37:32.200]  the appointees to the all important credentials and rules committee made the possibility of
[1:37:32.200 --> 1:37:37.840]  a 1952 style hijacking of the nomination entirely possible.
[1:37:37.840 --> 1:37:40.800]  So yes, I raised money to prepare for that.
[1:37:40.800 --> 1:37:50.160]  And then many of you remember that we planned to execute exit polling in order to compare
[1:37:50.160 --> 1:37:57.200]  those results with the machine results in certain key precincts in certain key states.
[1:37:57.200 --> 1:38:03.600]  As soon as I announced this, five different Democratic State committees plus the Democratic
[1:38:03.600 --> 1:38:09.080]  National Committee sued us claiming that we were trying to intimidate voters.
[1:38:09.080 --> 1:38:15.000]  We won those lawsuits, every single one of them, and we were upheld in the U.S. Supreme
[1:38:15.000 --> 1:38:21.040]  Court because you can't intimidate a voter by asking them voluntarily how they voted
[1:38:21.040 --> 1:38:24.560]  after they have cast their ballot.
[1:38:24.560 --> 1:38:30.320]  So my political activities are clean, they're above board, they're legal, and I think they
[1:38:30.320 --> 1:38:32.720]  made a real difference.
[1:38:32.720 --> 1:38:41.200]  But they can be mischaracterized as can any niche of your political or financial being.
[1:38:41.200 --> 1:38:44.560]  Of this I am certain there is a goal.
[1:38:44.560 --> 1:38:52.080]  I recognize by going on Twitter or Facebook the absolute torrent of hate that is kicked
[1:38:52.080 --> 1:38:55.040]  up by the fake news media.
[1:38:55.040 --> 1:39:01.680]  So for example, when the Wall Street Journal said that I was digging dirt on Hillary in
[1:39:01.680 --> 1:39:07.240]  September of 2016, I'm sorry, I don't think trying to find out the truth about the coup
[1:39:07.240 --> 1:39:12.760]  in Libya and the murder of Momar Gaddafi constitutes digging dirt.
[1:39:12.760 --> 1:39:18.920]  It's a perfectly legitimate political research and journalistic endeavor.
[1:39:18.920 --> 1:39:24.000]  So this timeframe is immaterial.
[1:39:24.000 --> 1:39:31.920]  It does, however, miss the focus of the Wall Street Journal that the entire story reinforces
[1:39:31.920 --> 1:39:33.160]  what I have said.
[1:39:33.160 --> 1:39:39.520]  It proves that my testimony before the House Intelligence Committee was entirely truthful
[1:39:39.520 --> 1:39:45.000]  that I had no direct contact, never spoke with, never met with, never received anything
[1:39:45.000 --> 1:39:48.960]  from WikiLeaks or Julian Assange.
[1:39:48.960 --> 1:39:54.240]  We did demonstrate that in this story, but that wasn't the lead.
[1:39:54.240 --> 1:39:59.640]  The lead was purposefully misleading claim that there was something improper within a
[1:39:59.640 --> 1:40:04.840]  request to my back channel, Randy Credico.
[1:40:04.840 --> 1:40:11.480]  Now Credico goes on MSNBC to deny that he's the back channel, yet the email in the Wall
[1:40:11.480 --> 1:40:15.080]  Street Journal article proves that it is.
[1:40:15.080 --> 1:40:20.360]  Mr. Credico is an extraordinarily adept liar.
[1:40:20.360 --> 1:40:27.720]  In fact, David Lugo, who has appeared on this program, confirmed for the Wall Street Journal
[1:40:27.720 --> 1:40:34.480]  that Credico admitted that he was the back channel that confirmed that Assange would
[1:40:34.480 --> 1:40:42.000]  drop the payload in October, and that he was on a movie set in which I said it, in which
[1:40:42.000 --> 1:40:45.760]  he dispassionately watched my performance and said nothing.
[1:40:45.760 --> 1:40:48.760]  Six members of his crew confirmed that.
[1:40:48.760 --> 1:40:54.800]  Now when I showed up for my filming of Sensational, a great movie that David Lugo is producing
[1:40:54.800 --> 1:41:02.240]  and which Alex Jones also stars, I believe I was most professional and I gave a succinct
[1:41:02.240 --> 1:41:05.040]  and tight performance.
[1:41:05.040 --> 1:41:12.840]  Credico showed up for his interview, drunk, high, unbathed, unable to deliver his lines,
[1:41:12.840 --> 1:41:18.760]  literally his pants were falling down, and according to Lugo, he was wearing blue women's
[1:41:18.760 --> 1:41:19.760]  underwear.
[1:41:19.760 --> 1:41:23.920]  Hey, whatever floats your boat, Randy.
[1:41:23.920 --> 1:41:31.520]  And now, Credico has been caught in a stunning lie that involves WikiLeaks, the neocon warmonger
[1:41:31.520 --> 1:41:39.080]  Adam Schiff, and MSNBC's Ari Melbor and his show, The Beat Off.
[1:41:39.080 --> 1:41:41.360]  We'll be right back to talk about it.
[1:41:41.360 --> 1:41:47.500]  In the meantime, recognize that the Mueller takedown of me, which is most definitely in
[1:41:47.500 --> 1:41:54.760]  the planning stages, the massive lawsuits against me by the DNC and by employees of
[1:41:54.760 --> 1:42:00.480]  the Democratic National Committee sponsored by an Obama group, the Sandy Hook lawsuit
[1:42:00.480 --> 1:42:08.200]  against Alex Jones and all the other phony, frivolous harassment lawsuits, have one goal,
[1:42:08.200 --> 1:42:09.840]  our bankruptcy.
[1:42:09.840 --> 1:42:13.600]  So we have no funds to fight to stay on the internet.
[1:42:13.600 --> 1:42:14.960]  Here's what you can do.
[1:42:14.960 --> 1:42:17.800]  Go to StoneDefenseFund.com.
[1:42:17.800 --> 1:42:20.380]  My wife and I need your help.
[1:42:20.380 --> 1:42:26.320]  This is going to be an epic, expensive battle, but I'm not rolling on Donald Trump and I
[1:42:26.320 --> 1:42:28.640]  need your help for the fight.
[1:42:28.640 --> 1:42:35.160]  And then go to the Infowars.com site and find the donate button because Alex Jones and
[1:42:35.160 --> 1:42:42.080]  the entire Infowars crew need your help to fight back their frivolous harassment lawsuits.
[1:42:42.080 --> 1:42:44.240]  You can help in both ways, folks.
[1:42:44.240 --> 1:42:49.280]  There you see the donation page, send $25, $50, $100.
[1:42:49.280 --> 1:42:51.560]  God will bless you for it.
[1:42:51.560 --> 1:42:56.440]  I'll be right back.

[1:45:22.280 --> 1:45:25.040]  dairy products, desserts, and entire meals.
[1:45:25.040 --> 1:45:26.960]  Woo, that's what I'm talking about.
[1:45:26.960 --> 1:45:31.920]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating,
[1:45:31.920 --> 1:45:35.920]  you know like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[1:45:35.920 --> 1:45:41.760]  Harvest right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value
[1:45:41.760 --> 1:45:45.240]  and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[1:45:45.240 --> 1:45:48.800]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[1:45:48.800 --> 1:45:52.840]  Harvest right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.
[1:45:52.840 --> 1:45:53.840]  So what are you waiting for?
[1:45:53.840 --> 1:45:56.600]  Check it out right now at infowarsstore.com.
[1:45:56.600 --> 1:46:01.560]  The scientists at InfoWarsLife have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support
[1:46:01.560 --> 1:46:03.320]  and joint support.
[1:46:03.320 --> 1:46:06.440]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with bodies.
[1:46:06.440 --> 1:46:10.280]  Bodies contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[1:46:10.280 --> 1:46:14.600]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[1:46:14.600 --> 1:46:18.760]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[1:46:18.760 --> 1:46:23.000]  Our pure turmeric extract plus peppering from black pepper makes for optimal absorption
[1:46:23.000 --> 1:46:28.240]  to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and
[1:46:28.240 --> 1:46:30.000]  so much more.
[1:46:30.000 --> 1:46:34.480]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1 to 5% of active ingredients.
[1:46:34.480 --> 1:46:40.240]  But our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the active ingredients.
[1:46:40.240 --> 1:46:46.160]  These combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme
[1:46:46.160 --> 1:46:49.040]  to work synergistically for full body support.

[1:47:17.520 --> 1:47:31.440]  Welcome back.
[1:47:31.440 --> 1:47:34.320]  Well you heard it here first.
[1:47:34.320 --> 1:47:39.600]  Special Counsel Robert Mueller coming up empty handed on any evidence of Russian collusion
[1:47:39.600 --> 1:47:46.920]  or WikiLeaks hijinks will now seek to frame me by concocting some extraneous charge that
[1:47:46.920 --> 1:47:53.280]  has to do with my personal, financial, or political activity.
[1:47:53.280 --> 1:47:55.880]  They're looking into my book sales.
[1:47:55.880 --> 1:48:01.560]  They're asking questions about my personal life, about members of my family.
[1:48:01.560 --> 1:48:08.080]  There is no question whatsoever at this point that my text messages, my phone calls, and
[1:48:08.080 --> 1:48:12.400]  my emails are completely and totally monitored.
[1:48:12.400 --> 1:48:16.120]  It is Big Brother Run Amok.
[1:48:16.120 --> 1:48:18.440]  How will I survive this, people ask me?
[1:48:18.440 --> 1:48:23.080]  How will you survive this onslaught from the federal prosecutors with their unlimited
[1:48:23.080 --> 1:48:24.840]  partner power?
[1:48:24.840 --> 1:48:31.640]  I will tell you how I intend to take on this onslaught.
[1:48:31.640 --> 1:48:40.200]  It is by following very carefully the rules in this book, Stone's Rules.
[1:48:40.200 --> 1:48:46.440]  Everything I need to know for the combat ahead is delineated in this tome.
[1:48:46.440 --> 1:48:52.760]  Now you can get your copy by going to the infowars.com site where there's a very special
[1:48:52.760 --> 1:48:54.280]  price.
[1:48:54.280 --> 1:49:00.640]  As I said on Friday, anyone who buys this book on the info wars store site and pays
[1:49:00.640 --> 1:49:06.600]  to send it to me, I will be happy to sign it and pay for the return postage personally.
[1:49:06.600 --> 1:49:10.000]  That's how strongly I feel about this great book.
[1:49:10.000 --> 1:49:12.700]  This is my roadmap of battle.
[1:49:12.700 --> 1:49:19.180]  This is what I will be consulting every day in the fight against Mueller and his gum
[1:49:19.180 --> 1:49:22.840]  shoes and his running dogs.
[1:49:22.840 --> 1:49:28.680]  This is going to be an epic battle because, folks, they want me to testify against the
[1:49:28.680 --> 1:49:29.680]  president.
[1:49:29.680 --> 1:49:32.960]  They want me to help them bring him down.
[1:49:32.960 --> 1:49:38.840]  Now I've known Donald Trump for 30 years and I've been very discreet about my relationship
[1:49:38.840 --> 1:49:41.560]  with him and I always will be.
[1:49:41.560 --> 1:49:46.200]  I don't know what Michael Cohen will choose to do.
[1:49:46.200 --> 1:49:49.240]  I don't know what Michael Cohen has done.
[1:49:49.240 --> 1:49:54.760]  I don't know what they have on him, but I do know that they are pressuring him to testify
[1:49:54.760 --> 1:49:56.800]  against the president.
[1:49:56.800 --> 1:49:59.080]  He can go his own way.
[1:49:59.080 --> 1:50:07.280]  I will never betray Donald J. Trump, even though I know that they will pile on bogus
[1:50:07.280 --> 1:50:14.480]  charge after charge in an attempt to do so, to make me do so, which is why I ask you again
[1:50:14.480 --> 1:50:20.360]  to consider a generous contribution to StoneDefenseFund.com.
[1:50:20.360 --> 1:50:24.880]  Very soon we're going to unleash the Infowars Legal Defense Fund.
[1:50:24.880 --> 1:50:26.680]  We have no choice.
[1:50:26.680 --> 1:50:33.000]  They're coming at Alex Jones and Infowars just as hard as they're coming at me.
[1:50:33.000 --> 1:50:38.720]  Federal investigators have interrogated now at least 12 of my associates about my relationship
[1:50:38.720 --> 1:50:45.160]  with Infowars and Jones, wanting to know how often we speak by phone, whether we speak
[1:50:45.160 --> 1:50:51.200]  via WhatsApp or Signal, whether I write Jones' material.
[1:50:51.200 --> 1:50:52.200]  That's ridiculous.
[1:50:52.200 --> 1:50:54.640]  Nobody writes Jones' material.
[1:50:54.640 --> 1:51:00.040]  But these are the kind of questions that lead me to believe that the shutdown of Infowars
[1:51:00.040 --> 1:51:02.160]  is in their agenda.
[1:51:02.160 --> 1:51:03.800]  They want to silence me.
[1:51:03.800 --> 1:51:04.800]  Why?
[1:51:04.800 --> 1:51:09.120]  Because I talk about Robert Mueller's role in Uranium One, and the fact that he's the
[1:51:09.120 --> 1:51:22.480]  one who brought—know that I have been in the forefront of those questioning his role
[1:51:22.480 --> 1:51:33.800]  in the anthrax murders, because I have questioned his role in the Whitey-Bulger scandal.
[1:51:33.800 --> 1:51:39.880]  So I am a critic of Mr. Mueller, and they want to silence me, whether it is his role
[1:51:39.880 --> 1:51:48.720]  in 9-1-1 or whether it is—or pardon me, 9-11—or whether it is the illegitimate politically
[1:51:48.720 --> 1:51:55.320]  based inquisition that he is currently conducting.
[1:51:55.320 --> 1:52:02.800]  Robert Mueller may think that he is Thomas Beckett and that the president is the king,
[1:52:02.800 --> 1:52:05.320]  King Richard II, I believe.
[1:52:05.320 --> 1:52:11.800]  But in fact, Robert Mueller is Turk Mada, and this is an inquisition in which there are
[1:52:11.800 --> 1:52:18.920]  no rules, in which your personal life, your family life, your business life, your political
[1:52:18.920 --> 1:52:26.760]  activities, your free speech—your expressions of free speech are all under attack, all under
[1:52:26.760 --> 1:52:33.880]  a microscope, poking, poking, probing, searching for anything that can be mischaracterized
[1:52:33.880 --> 1:52:36.960]  in a false light to frame me.
[1:52:36.960 --> 1:52:43.920]  Again, I have no intention of rolling on this president, lesser men may do so if they wish,
[1:52:43.920 --> 1:52:50.480]  but I will choose, no matter what the shape of the frame-up is, to fight, but I cannot
[1:52:50.480 --> 1:52:51.480]  do it alone.
[1:52:51.480 --> 1:52:58.160]  Now, in recent days, there has been an interesting development where my back channel, proven
[1:52:58.160 --> 1:53:04.440]  now without dispute to be Randy Kredico, an out-of-work radio personality in New York,
[1:53:04.440 --> 1:53:16.440]  claims that he was authorized by Julian Assange to broker an interview with Adam Schiff and
[1:53:16.440 --> 1:53:19.360]  Democratic House investigators.
[1:53:19.360 --> 1:53:25.400]  I don't believe that to be the case, but then I think Adam Schiff showed his hand when
[1:53:25.400 --> 1:53:29.920]  he said that the only circumstances under which he would be interested in questioning
[1:53:29.920 --> 1:53:35.000]  Mr. Assange was if Julian Assange was in custody.
[1:53:35.000 --> 1:53:41.080]  In view of the fact that there are no known federal charges against pending against Mr.
[1:53:41.080 --> 1:53:48.120]  Assange, this is either the signaling that Schiff knows that there is a secret sealed
[1:53:48.120 --> 1:53:58.440]  indictment against Assange, or it is further proof that Assange never approved this approach
[1:53:58.440 --> 1:54:03.280]  of Schiff by Kredico, and that Kredico has made that up.
[1:54:03.280 --> 1:54:10.800]  My sources, which are indirect, but are journalistic, tell me Assange never agreed to speak with
[1:54:10.800 --> 1:54:16.800]  Schiff, and therefore Randy Kredico is busted in yet another lie.
[1:54:16.800 --> 1:54:23.400]  Folks, if you like this elementary truth, if you like the fact that we're going to fight
[1:54:23.400 --> 1:54:31.960]  back and we're not going to stand for efforts to take down this president, and let me say
[1:54:31.960 --> 1:54:39.040]  at the outset, I am not John Dean, I refuse to be John Dean, well then we need your help
[1:54:39.040 --> 1:54:43.760]  at the Infowars.com site and we need it now.
[1:54:43.760 --> 1:54:51.160]  I say this because Infowars faces the greatest challenge in its history.
[1:54:51.160 --> 1:54:52.480]  Make no mistake about it.
[1:54:52.480 --> 1:54:59.120]  We have some terrific Memorial Day specials where you can get Brain Force Plus, for example,
[1:54:59.120 --> 1:55:06.400]  my all-time favorite product, the one that is, in all honesty, fueling this very broadcast
[1:55:06.400 --> 1:55:09.080]  at 50% off.
[1:55:09.080 --> 1:55:13.440]  This in my opinion is one of the very best nutraceutical products because it gives you
[1:55:13.440 --> 1:55:21.040]  mental clarity and mental energy without giving you that jacked up, spacey feeling, and later
[1:55:21.040 --> 1:55:27.040]  that evening, you can sleep 50% off, a terrific price on Brain Force Plus.
[1:55:27.040 --> 1:55:33.320]  But whether it is my book, Stone's Rules, or a t-shirt, or a cutting-edge nutraceutical
[1:55:33.320 --> 1:55:39.720]  like the red pill or immune wall, two of my other favorites, you help the fight for freedom
[1:55:39.720 --> 1:55:42.480]  when you go to the Infowars.com site.
[1:55:42.480 --> 1:55:50.800]  And while you're there, stop by the donation site, send us $50 or $25 or $100, send a matching
[1:55:50.800 --> 1:55:54.840]  contribution to StoneDefenseFund.com.
[1:55:54.840 --> 1:55:57.600]  We have one heck of a battle ahead of us.
[1:55:57.600 --> 1:56:00.640]  Alex Jones will never fold.
[1:56:00.640 --> 1:56:03.040]  Roger Stone will never fold.
[1:56:03.040 --> 1:56:06.200]  But we are in for Armageddon.
[1:56:06.200 --> 1:56:09.480]  This will be the battle of all time.
[1:56:09.480 --> 1:56:13.200]  The mainstream media is intent on smearing me.
[1:56:13.200 --> 1:56:18.360]  There are even MSNBCs, actually located, an old girlfriend who will make false charges
[1:56:18.360 --> 1:56:20.160]  against me.
[1:56:20.160 --> 1:56:25.440]  This is becoming a bloodbath of lies by the mainstream media.
[1:56:25.440 --> 1:56:28.280]  Atlantic has a story today about the timeline.
[1:56:28.280 --> 1:56:29.960]  The timeline doesn't matter.
[1:56:29.960 --> 1:56:36.200]  The timeline shows I asked a legitimate question about the Libyan coup in September.
[1:56:36.200 --> 1:56:38.400]  That's nothing wrong with that.
[1:56:38.400 --> 1:56:42.280]  And it proves that critical was my back channel.
[1:56:42.280 --> 1:56:43.800]  So there you have it, folks.
[1:56:43.800 --> 1:56:48.720]  Even when news breaks that exonerates us, The Wall Street Journal, The Atlantic, the
[1:56:48.720 --> 1:56:55.160]  other lefty fake news organizations, twisted to try to make it something it is not.
[1:56:55.160 --> 1:56:59.800]  I'm going to join Alex Jones tomorrow on the Alex Jones show to bring you the very latest
[1:56:59.800 --> 1:57:01.600]  update on this.
[1:57:01.600 --> 1:57:07.440]  But you have to understand what it is like to know that the federal government is in
[1:57:07.440 --> 1:57:14.040]  your email, in yourselves, your text messages, in your phone calls, and that it is a political
[1:57:14.040 --> 1:57:15.040]  vendetta.
[1:57:15.040 --> 1:57:20.920]  I folks have broken no laws and done nothing wrong, but I will be targeted in an effort
[1:57:20.920 --> 1:57:25.960]  to trump up charges against me to get me to turn on Donald Trump.
[1:57:25.960 --> 1:57:27.440]  Not happening.
[1:57:27.440 --> 1:57:32.120]  Stay tuned for the latest information on this struggle.
[1:57:32.120 --> 1:57:37.040]  Thank you so much for those who have donated at StoneDefenseFun.com and thanks to those
[1:57:37.040 --> 1:57:39.400]  who will donate now.
