[00:00.000 --> 00:17.940]  before America can be great again she must be free again you're listening to
[00:17.940 --> 00:33.880]  the Alex Jones show from the road all watch it's coming up in the fourth
[00:33.880 --> 00:39.320]  hour will be addressing an article he is written for info wars calm that breaks
[00:39.320 --> 00:44.780]  it down another shocking example of the mass Stockholm syndrome sweeping not
[00:44.780 --> 00:52.460]  just Europe but also the United States at a anti-racism concert in Sweden
[00:52.460 --> 00:59.100]  migrants raped women in the middle of the crowd this is in mainstream news in
[00:59.100 --> 01:04.140]  Sweden in Germany a German minister it's now been discovered it was raped a
[01:04.140 --> 01:13.640]  federal minister and covered it up and blamed it on Germans as to not turn the
[01:13.640 --> 01:18.700]  population against the Muslims ladies and gentlemen I was against the illegal
[01:18.700 --> 01:22.860]  wars in the Middle East because I thought it would stir up that population
[01:22.860 --> 01:27.700]  to be part of the clash of civilizations the globalists have written about using
[01:27.700 --> 01:33.060]  the clash the crisis to destroy Western liberties and actually put even more
[01:33.060 --> 01:37.540]  radical jihadist in control in the Middle East as General Flynn and others
[01:37.540 --> 01:42.260]  have spoken about and exposed but here's the bottom line all you PC scumbags
[01:42.260 --> 01:46.460]  you ally yourselves with authoritarianism and then you go around
[01:46.460 --> 01:52.140]  bullying true liberals and the bastion of freedom in the West telling us we've
[01:52.140 --> 01:55.420]  got to give up our language we've got to give up our freedom we've got to
[01:55.420 --> 02:02.260]  comply with every foreign alien system like Islam that absolutely enslaves
[02:02.260 --> 02:07.580]  women absolutely is a tolerant of other religions and murders homosexuals you
[02:07.580 --> 02:11.180]  people are intellectually bankrupt and you're financed by the globalist and
[02:11.180 --> 02:14.420]  the whole black lives matter organizations the rest of it are a joke
[02:14.420 --> 02:18.940]  we've had black lives matter people calling in yesterday and saying Alex you
[02:18.940 --> 02:22.500]  just don't like black people that's a load of horse manure you people are
[02:22.500 --> 02:26.540]  idiots George Soros is a Nazi collaborator piece of crap that brings
[02:26.540 --> 02:31.420]  down countries and he's using sociology and he's using psychology to play us
[02:31.420 --> 02:35.500]  off against each other and take almost non-existent issues and make it the
[02:35.500 --> 02:39.180]  number one red herring while he prepares with others to totally implode this
[02:39.180 --> 02:43.780]  country so I suggest you wake up and get up off your fat intellectual dumb
[02:43.780 --> 02:49.260]  asses and start trying to save civilization the globalists are
[02:49.260 --> 02:53.020]  bringing in tyranny because it'll merge with their system of tyranny and they
[02:53.020 --> 02:57.180]  think Islam will work with the socialist and the social engineers to bully us in
[02:57.180 --> 03:01.700]  the full submission well guess what it didn't work and I'm pissed everybody
[03:01.700 --> 03:05.420]  else is getting angry and we're never going away we're never giving up and we
[03:05.420 --> 03:09.940]  know what's going on now back to David Knight live in studio
[03:09.940 --> 03:16.740]  I'm here in the studio on this Tuesday July 12 2016 I'm David Knight Alex is
[03:16.740 --> 03:19.900]  going to be joining us later in the show with other special reports of course
[03:19.900 --> 03:24.140]  he's going to be talking about Bernie Sanders who is endorsing Hillary Clinton
[03:24.140 --> 03:28.740]  today no surprise there one thing you may be surprised about Bernie Sanders is
[03:28.740 --> 03:34.940]  that he's been getting $38,000 a day secret service protection as he's been
[03:34.940 --> 03:40.540]  going on this futility that he's going on and of course you know he wants free
[03:40.540 --> 03:45.220]  college for everybody $38,000 that would go a long way towards paying some
[03:45.220 --> 03:50.700]  people's annual tuition but Bernie is just eating that up with his security
[03:50.700 --> 03:55.580]  protection understand that one of the most broken institutions we have in
[03:55.580 --> 04:00.500]  this country course is our institution of education especially higher learning
[04:00.500 --> 04:05.020]  as they call it it is nothing but propaganda selling the lies have been
[04:05.020 --> 04:08.180]  created by these 60s radicals about white-skinned privilege and other things
[04:08.180 --> 04:13.500]  to permit racial division I'm not saying that we can't talk about the
[04:13.500 --> 04:17.500]  differences in the way people are treated that's a misunderstanding of that but
[04:17.500 --> 04:22.820]  the way they use white-skinned privilege it was a weapon Bill Ayers stopped
[04:22.820 --> 04:27.580]  bombing buildings and he started brainwashing our children that's what's
[04:27.580 --> 04:32.460]  behind this educational establishment and that's why Bernie and Hillary want
[04:32.460 --> 04:35.020]  free college for everybody now we're gonna be talking about what's going on
[04:35.020 --> 04:39.340]  with Trump we have some breaking news about the effort to stop Trump at the
[04:39.340 --> 04:43.300]  convention they never trump people who said there are no committed delegates
[04:43.300 --> 04:46.940]  well a federal judge has just said otherwise we're gonna have that and
[04:46.940 --> 05:02.540]  more news we come back stay with us the Chinese president has ordered the
[05:02.540 --> 05:07.900]  People's Liberation Army to prepare for combat as a measure against possible
[05:07.900 --> 05:13.460]  hostile US action in the South China Sea after an international tribunal ruled
[05:13.460 --> 05:18.220]  that Beijing had no exclusive control over the area the permanent court of
[05:18.220 --> 05:22.300]  arbitration said that there was no evidence that China had historically
[05:22.300 --> 05:27.420]  exercised exclusive control over the waters or resources reports the BBC
[05:27.420 --> 05:32.580]  China responded by labeling the ruling ill-founded and refused to be bound by
[05:32.580 --> 05:37.500]  it however behind the scenes the Chinese president fears that the US could seize
[05:37.500 --> 05:42.260]  on the ruling to justify aggressive military maneuvers in the area and has
[05:42.260 --> 05:47.740]  ordered PLA forces to prepare for war China's Navy has repeatedly issued

[08:10.460 --> 08:23.180]  live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[08:23.180 --> 08:28.260]  we've seen incredible gullibility out of the Republican parties constituent some
[08:28.260 --> 08:32.780]  of the years just look at all the lies that George W. Bush supporters put up
[08:32.780 --> 08:39.140]  with but I gotta tell you Democrats take the cake especially Bernie Sanders
[08:39.140 --> 08:45.340]  supporters he came out yesterday and said that oh we've realized so many of
[08:45.340 --> 08:51.020]  our goals and we're so victorious and now I'm throwing my support to Hillary
[08:51.020 --> 08:58.180]  when Hillary is the most corporate most crony capitalist candidate out of the
[08:58.180 --> 09:03.580]  entire field we've seen the last two years I mean she makes Donald Trump
[09:03.580 --> 09:09.380]  look like the outsider he is and it's so sad to see Bernie supporters who are
[09:09.380 --> 09:15.500]  committed to getting their so-called free lunch buying into anything and
[09:15.500 --> 09:20.340]  everything that the Democratic Party pitches out it's so clear that the big
[09:20.340 --> 09:24.700]  money and the big media and all the big robber barons are lined up against
[09:24.700 --> 09:31.900]  Donald Trump but most of the former Bernie supporters out there that are
[09:31.900 --> 09:37.300]  being pulled are saying hey we're going for Hillary it's truly shameful then
[09:37.300 --> 09:42.580]  the corporate media that sells us all these illegal wars and all these other
[09:42.580 --> 09:47.300]  lies is telling us Donald Trump's an evil racist and the worst person in the
[09:47.300 --> 09:52.460]  world and that we all need to support Hillary because that's the best thing to
[09:52.460 --> 09:57.460]  do and that it's good to go out and demonstrate and protest against the
[09:57.460 --> 10:03.700]  local police because they're corrupt that's the big out-of-control federal
[10:03.700 --> 10:07.620]  government bought and paid for by foreign interests that militarized the
[10:07.620 --> 10:12.860]  police to be their enforcers now because they're concerned about an American
[10:12.860 --> 10:17.380]  style brings it out of the North American Union and globalism they're
[10:17.380 --> 10:22.300]  trying to trigger the revolution that's brewing against a local government and
[10:22.300 --> 10:27.980]  police they're trying to distract the public at the same time bring in a type
[10:27.980 --> 10:34.380]  of soft civil war where the UN can then be the honchos of the reorganization of
[10:34.380 --> 10:39.180]  the United States look at the riots all over the country the police station is
[10:39.180 --> 10:44.340]  being shot up the police being killed can you just walk up to police you don't
[10:44.340 --> 10:49.540]  even know the name of and randomly say you deserve to die some will say well
[10:49.540 --> 10:55.020]  they do that to some citizens statistically police killings are flat
[10:55.020 --> 11:00.220]  even as the crime rate has been lower for 20 years starts to go up because the
[11:00.220 --> 11:06.620]  economy is imploding all Americans are starting to see on average their living
[11:06.620 --> 11:09.940]  standards go down we're seeing our basic freedoms under attack we are
[11:09.940 --> 11:15.660]  collectively as a citizen free under attack that was so exciting a few weeks
[11:15.660 --> 11:20.900]  ago to see the Brexit which was a move against globalism led by the Ron Paul
[11:20.900 --> 11:27.060]  slash Alex Jones slash Matt drudge of Europe Nigel Farage to see that for days
[11:27.060 --> 11:32.700]  be the number one search term to have more search terms than all porn terms
[11:32.700 --> 11:38.500]  combined there was one other search term was also number one for a day and in the
[11:38.500 --> 11:42.020]  top five for an entire week that was Hillary for prison it shows the power
[11:42.020 --> 11:48.020]  of we the populist peoples the libertarians the Libertad the true
[11:48.020 --> 11:53.060]  liberators the liberals not the controllers not the counterfeit liberals
[11:53.060 --> 11:57.580]  and their Republican cohorts who are trying to shackle and control this huge
[11:57.580 --> 12:04.100]  awakening is taking place I'm going to Cleveland in just a few days I'm gonna be
[12:04.100 --> 12:09.500]  there for the full week of the RNC we're also sending crew to the DNC and we're
[12:09.500 --> 12:12.060]  gonna be standing up for the truth we're going to be exposing that the
[12:12.060 --> 12:15.100]  Republican Party has said they're still gonna try to steal the nomination of
[12:15.100 --> 12:18.860]  Donald Trump we're gonna be there exposing the social justice warriors and
[12:18.860 --> 12:23.660]  how programmed they are and we're gonna be putting airplanes in the sky that
[12:23.660 --> 12:26.660]  point out that Hillary should be sent to prison not the White House we're gonna
[12:26.660 --> 12:30.180]  have trucks driving around town with the same thing on the side all because you've
[12:30.180 --> 12:33.980]  taken action and believed in us we believed in you and the in full war is
[12:33.980 --> 12:40.100]  having a giant effect now I've got other reports coming up today that deal
[12:40.100 --> 12:43.900]  with the assault on reality the attempt to get the average person not be
[12:43.900 --> 12:48.100]  politically or culturally involved we're gonna be looking at some of the
[12:48.100 --> 12:52.820]  big phenomenons in AI and augmented reality the new Pokemon go phenomenon
[12:52.820 --> 12:57.140]  and more and David Nines can be breaking down with his guest Anthony
[12:57.140 --> 12:59.740]  and sharding and others the latest breaking news of taking your phone
[12:59.740 --> 13:06.940]  calls but make no mistake with the entire establishment and the entire media
[13:06.940 --> 13:13.340]  that we know we're a pack of criminal liars just credited frauds are telling
[13:13.340 --> 13:19.820]  us that Hillary Clinton's our Lord and Savior if we really elect her a lot of
[13:19.820 --> 13:25.820]  people deserve what they get all I know is I feel like America the whole
[13:25.820 --> 13:29.540]  world's reached the point of return it's not that Donald Trump is a perfect
[13:29.540 --> 13:34.380]  solution but he's a protest against everything we've seen so far and I hope
[13:34.380 --> 13:42.780]  that we can live up to what our cousins in the UK have done and send out a
[13:42.780 --> 13:47.660]  signal in 2016 that we too are leaving corporate world government corporate
[13:47.660 --> 13:52.940]  unelected globalism that was rejected in the bricks it that's what a Donald
[13:52.940 --> 13:58.340]  Trump victory would be it's time for Americans to wake up it's time to make
[13:58.340 --> 14:04.820]  America free again and that will make this country great again all right back
[14:04.820 --> 14:09.460]  to the live transmission and David I'll be back later with an analysis on some
[14:09.460 --> 14:15.020]  of the new AI technologies being rolled out okay and I'm David Knight here in
[14:15.020 --> 14:20.260]  the studio on this Tuesday July 12 2016 Alex was just talking about Brexit of
[14:20.260 --> 14:23.980]  course there's some interesting developments going on in Britain as we
[14:23.980 --> 14:28.020]  see the change and Prime Minister happening announced yesterday that it
[14:28.020 --> 14:33.540]  will be changed tomorrow you know David Cameron promoted Brexit actually he
[14:33.540 --> 14:40.860]  promoted staying in the EU he gave them the referendum kind of interesting you
[14:40.860 --> 14:46.620]  know came up in a pizzeria in Chicago other we're at a pizzeria uno we're
[14:46.620 --> 14:51.660]  told was after an economic summit in Chicago and I guess they were sitting
[14:51.660 --> 14:56.540]  there and saw the pizzeria uno as a sign or something I don't know maybe
[14:56.540 --> 15:00.100]  and somebody came up to him and said hey you want that to go you want to take
[15:00.100 --> 15:04.060]  out and they said that's it we'll do that because you know they were facing
[15:04.060 --> 15:09.340]  pressure from Nigel Farage and UKIP which made getting out of the European
[15:09.340 --> 15:14.100]  Union one of their core issues why because of sovereignty you know the
[15:14.100 --> 15:18.900]  border issue is just one aspect of the sovereignty they were completely shutting
[15:18.900 --> 15:23.180]  down and controlling the British economy issues like not allowing British
[15:23.180 --> 15:28.500]  fishermen to fish in the North Sea or Britain to even have a say in that
[15:28.500 --> 15:33.180]  issue not to have a say in how their trade was going to be managed you know
[15:33.180 --> 15:39.180]  they were being completely dominated by these bureaucrats in Brussels so they
[15:39.180 --> 15:43.540]  had the Brexit David Cameron however wanted to remain in the EU when they
[15:43.540 --> 15:46.220]  lost immediately announced that he was going to get out they were going to he
[15:46.220 --> 15:48.420]  was going to let somebody else in the Conservative Party take over the
[15:48.420 --> 15:56.140]  leadership and manage this transition out of the EU what we saw then was a
[15:56.140 --> 15:59.820]  contest most people believe that Boris Johnson was going to be the one to take
[15:59.820 --> 16:03.940]  over leadership of the Conservative Party he shortly took himself out said
[16:03.940 --> 16:08.700]  Michael Gove is going to not there's a parent that he was not going to sport
[16:08.700 --> 16:13.620]  Boris Johnson was going to run for it himself then he left then we were left
[16:13.620 --> 16:17.420]  with two women and the news articles were we're gonna have a British Prime
[16:17.420 --> 16:21.140]  Minister that is female for the first time since Margaret Thatcher then
[16:21.140 --> 16:26.020]  suddenly yesterday the one of the females in it dropped out now the
[16:26.020 --> 16:30.420]  interesting thing is is that Boris Johnson Michael Gove and the lady who
[16:30.420 --> 16:35.020]  dropped out yesterday they were all supportive of Brexit they all wanted to
[16:35.020 --> 16:41.940]  see Britain leave the EU the one person who was in the race Teresa May who is
[16:41.940 --> 16:45.180]  now going to be the Prime Minister by default they've cut these deals and
[16:45.180 --> 16:48.940]  back rooms she was she's now going to be the Prime Minister by default she was
[16:48.940 --> 16:53.500]  the one person out of all these candidates up for leadership of the
[16:53.500 --> 16:59.220]  Conservative Party that did not support Brexit now she is saying that Brexit
[16:59.220 --> 17:03.380]  means Brexit and we're going to make a success of it nevertheless the David
[17:03.380 --> 17:06.020]  Cameron said we're not going to do anything with this we're not going to
[17:06.020 --> 17:11.180]  file the paperwork to get out of the treaty until September when we have our
[17:11.180 --> 17:16.260]  decision to have a new leader of the Conservative Party they very quickly and
[17:16.260 --> 17:21.100]  abruptly set a new leader of the Conservative Party but now even though
[17:21.100 --> 17:24.660]  that's happened very quickly they're saying they're going to delay it another
[17:24.660 --> 17:30.220]  three months before they start the process of leaving the European Union so
[17:30.220 --> 17:34.060]  now we go not from a delay of three months but to a delay of six months
[17:34.060 --> 17:37.460]  before they even start the process even more troubling this article that we had
[17:37.460 --> 17:42.620]  last we talked about last night on the nightly news we had it on infowars.com
[17:42.620 --> 17:48.340]  yesterday Brexit vote was not binding so Parliament must decide said lawyers okay
[17:48.340 --> 17:53.420]  this is about a thousand British lawyers who have signed a letter saying that
[17:53.420 --> 17:57.740]  invoking article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty is not something that the Prime
[17:57.740 --> 18:02.660]  Minister can do on their own the argument is that Parliament turned over
[18:02.660 --> 18:06.980]  their sovereignty to the European Union and only Parliament can take it back and
[18:06.980 --> 18:12.980]  then get this they said the Brexit referendum was merely an advisory
[18:12.980 --> 18:17.980]  merely an advisory does that sound familiar does that sound like what the
[18:17.980 --> 18:22.220]  Republican delegates who are saying never Trump are saying to us saying we
[18:22.220 --> 18:26.180]  don't really care about all of your primaries all of your elections those
[18:26.180 --> 18:29.700]  were merely advisories and we're not gonna really pay any attention to that
[18:29.700 --> 18:35.580]  we're going to not violate our consciences okay we're going to violate
[18:35.580 --> 18:41.900]  the public trust and we've now had an interesting case from a judge we'll talk
[18:41.900 --> 18:45.260]  about that in a minute but I don't want to leave Brexit yet at the same time this
[18:45.260 --> 18:49.380]  is happening the British people need to understand that the same issues that
[18:49.380 --> 18:53.460]  cause them to vote to leave the European Union are still there and they're there
[18:53.460 --> 18:58.700]  in spades okay we have this article from the Deutsche Bank Economist that said on
[18:58.700 --> 19:03.220]  Sunday that the EU banks need another $166 billion now I don't know where
[19:03.220 --> 19:09.460]  they get that because the Italian banks by themselves need 360 billion euros
[19:09.460 --> 19:14.100]  they've got bad loans of that amount they were looking for the British to
[19:14.100 --> 19:18.300]  essentially bail them out of that and they're very upset that they don't have
[19:18.300 --> 19:22.020]  that money I actually heard somebody in the immediate aftermath of Brexit
[19:22.020 --> 19:26.980]  talking about how this is bad we know we haven't talked about this but we
[19:26.980 --> 19:31.660]  really need British money we didn't mention it as the the run-up to the
[19:31.660 --> 19:35.100]  referendum because we didn't want to scare the people in Britain we didn't
[19:35.100 --> 19:39.820]  want them to vote against this but that's the reality and at the same time
[19:39.820 --> 19:43.500]  this Deutsche Bank Economist says well you know I don't expect to see a second
[19:43.500 --> 19:48.540]  financial crisis like 2008 but we have another article that we had yesterday on
[19:48.540 --> 19:52.380]  info wars.com from David Stockman remember him from the Reagan administration
[19:52.380 --> 19:56.900]  he said here we go again he said the conditions are even worse now hang on

[24:38.100 --> 24:42.980]  rebellion but it is a vocal rebellion of people inside the Republican

[26:04.740 --> 26:09.740]  info war select storeable food now what happened today with the never Trump
[26:09.740 --> 26:16.220]  movement you remember we've had this lady Kindle Unruh who is a Utah delegate
[26:16.220 --> 26:21.060]  she has a small organization called Free the Delegates we also have Curly
[26:21.060 --> 26:26.460]  Hogan who is the guy who said hey we get to do whatever we want to it's our
[26:26.460 --> 26:30.500]  party and I remember when he was interviewed on CNN and they said well
[26:30.500 --> 26:36.260]  why do we even have primaries then and he said good question I don't think they
[26:36.260 --> 26:41.940]  matter and then we had this guy in Virginia his name is Bo Coral he's a
[26:41.940 --> 26:47.540]  lawyer he filed a class action lawsuit in Virginia challenging a state law that
[26:47.540 --> 26:53.780]  binds delegates to support the winner of the election he said that's a violation
[26:53.780 --> 26:58.780]  of his first amendment rights well what about our first amendment rights do we
[26:58.780 --> 27:03.980]  have rights I mean these people have the attitude of the super delegate
[27:03.980 --> 27:07.380]  mentality that we're seeing in the Democrat Party and it's interesting as
[27:07.380 --> 27:13.540]  we look at the collapse of Bernie Sanders the fact that he is totally sold
[27:13.540 --> 27:19.020]  out and we've got an article up on info wars.com dump the burn Dems revolt after
[27:19.020 --> 27:22.500]  Bernie endorses Hillary we've got a lot of people on social media that are
[27:22.500 --> 27:28.820]  tweeting out their disillusion with this whole process look folks he totally
[27:28.820 --> 27:33.420]  sold out when we talk about where he was on these issues he did get Hillary to
[27:33.420 --> 27:38.700]  jump in on the bandwagon of free college for everybody everybody in the
[27:38.700 --> 27:41.860]  world you know because anyone in the world can come here with our open
[27:41.860 --> 27:46.700]  borders and if they come here with open borders then they're entitled to a free
[27:46.700 --> 27:51.660]  education or at the very least right now they get in-state tuition which
[27:51.660 --> 27:56.300]  American citizens whose parents have lived here all their life who have
[27:56.300 --> 28:00.260]  paid taxes all their lives they don't get that same kind of consideration for
[28:00.260 --> 28:03.260]  in-state tuition but if you come here as an illegal immigrant you can go to
[28:03.260 --> 28:07.740]  any state you want to and get in-state tuition but they want to make that free
[28:07.740 --> 28:13.260]  for everybody and understand that when we look at I guess you know take a look
[28:13.260 --> 28:17.540]  at your tax bills you'll probably find and especially you'll be aware of this
[28:17.540 --> 28:20.980]  if you own a house if you are renting you may not see it because it's buried
[28:20.980 --> 28:26.620]  in your rent costs but the largest taxes that most of us pay are property
[28:26.620 --> 28:30.540]  taxes and you pay those property taxes even if you rent they're embedded in
[28:30.540 --> 28:34.340]  your rent you just don't see it so people aren't aware of it what is the major
[28:34.340 --> 28:41.260]  expense on your property taxes it's the schools and the schools are exploding and
[28:41.260 --> 28:44.880]  of course we have to have tutors to teach people in whatever language they
[28:44.880 --> 28:49.380]  demand coming into this country so let's expand this let's give everybody free
[28:49.380 --> 28:51.980]  college tuition it isn't going to make anything cheaper you know when you
[28:51.980 --> 28:57.380]  subsidize things they get quite a bit more expensive so college costs are
[28:57.380 --> 29:01.100]  going to soar out of control but that's okay we're going to educate the world
[29:01.100 --> 29:05.660]  and all it's going to cost you is everything you own it's going to cost
[29:05.660 --> 29:08.420]  you the ability to own a home because you're not going to be able to afford
[29:08.420 --> 29:12.700]  the taxes so Bernie got Hillary to move along with him on that but what he
[29:12.700 --> 29:17.980]  didn't get her to move along with was the opposition to these trans-Pacific and
[29:17.980 --> 29:21.020]  transatlantic partnerships these so-called partnerships they're actually
[29:21.020 --> 29:25.740]  trade treaties okay she's not going to give up on that you got to understand
[29:25.740 --> 29:30.580]  that's where the big money is they want to have these deals they were created
[29:30.580 --> 29:35.500]  by corporations in secret they want to push these controls and understand it
[29:35.500 --> 29:40.940]  is not free trade it is management of your economy by a committee that you
[29:40.940 --> 29:45.300]  have no influence or control over it's what the British people just said we've
[29:45.300 --> 29:48.220]  had enough of stay with us we'll be right back
[29:48.220 --> 29:55.180]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio

[29:59.660 --> 30:05.180]  the Chinese president has ordered the People's Liberation Army to prepare for
[30:05.180 --> 30:11.020]  combat as a measure against possible hostile US action in the South China Sea
[30:11.020 --> 30:15.860]  after an international tribunal ruled that Beijing had no exclusive control
[30:15.860 --> 30:20.300]  over the area the permanent court of arbitration said that there was no
[30:20.300 --> 30:24.620]  evidence that China had historically exercised exclusive control over the
[30:24.620 --> 30:30.100]  waters or resources reports the BBC China responded by labeling the ruling
[30:30.100 --> 30:35.420]  ill-founded and refused to be bound by it however behind the scenes the Chinese
[30:35.420 --> 30:39.940]  president fears that the US could seize on the ruling to justify aggressive
[30:39.940 --> 30:45.060]  military maneuvers in the area and has ordered PLA forces to prepare for war
[30:45.060 --> 30:49.740]  China's Navy has repeatedly issued warnings to US surveillance planes

[32:52.940 --> 32:56.260]  young Jevity and the products at info wars team dot-com have changed their
[32:56.260 --> 33:03.340]  lives check it out for yourself today from the front lines of the information
[33:03.340 --> 33:23.420]  war it's Alex Jones
[33:23.420 --> 33:29.460]  Donald Trump picked his VP running mate more and more the rumblings are that
[33:29.460 --> 33:34.300]  it's former general Michael T. Flynn Michael T. Flynn has been a
[33:34.300 --> 33:38.300]  registered Democrat for most of his life he seems to be pretty moderate a lot of
[33:38.300 --> 33:44.700]  his policies is that smart for Donald Trump to do when if Donald Trump gets
[33:44.700 --> 33:50.020]  assassinated then we would be basically under the control of someone who leans
[33:50.020 --> 33:56.700]  more Democrat than he does Republican I'm not trying to shoot down general
[33:56.700 --> 34:02.420]  Flynn in fact I've been a big supporter and fan of what he's done in his career
[34:02.420 --> 34:08.500]  and I followed a lot of his work but I want to throw out one of the cons one of
[34:08.500 --> 34:12.340]  the problems before we look at the good points now let's go back to about a month
[34:12.340 --> 34:18.220]  ago at that time senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama who I think is a great guy
[34:18.220 --> 34:21.700]  was at the top of the list the problem is they're already pushing this racist
[34:21.700 --> 34:25.500]  narrative against Trump where he puts a star on one of his advertisements and
[34:25.500 --> 34:29.940]  they say it's anti-Semitic I mean it's getting crazy and so they can obviously
[34:29.940 --> 34:35.380]  dig back into Republican politics in the 60s and 70s and the young Republicans
[34:35.380 --> 34:40.340]  the senator Sessions was part of and try to claim some racism angle I personally
[34:40.340 --> 34:43.420]  say double down and who cares what the political corrector gonna do they're
[34:43.420 --> 34:47.940]  always lying anyways should he go for some Republican governor woman or
[34:47.940 --> 34:52.020]  senator yeah if they're a constitutionalist they've got what it takes
[34:52.020 --> 34:57.420]  they've got a good record I'm over having a woman VP but it shouldn't just be a
[34:57.420 --> 35:00.980]  gimmick because it's a woman they're talking about Hillary doing Elizabeth
[35:00.980 --> 35:06.580]  Warren for an all-woman ticket just because they're women again that's a
[35:06.580 --> 35:11.660]  gimmick I'm sick of it but getting back to I like Michael T Flynn he really
[35:11.660 --> 35:16.180]  reformed a lot of the work in special forces he called for overseas spying not
[35:16.180 --> 35:21.260]  domestic spying he called for agency sharing information he tried to really
[35:21.260 --> 35:25.340]  stick up for people in the military but he also had more courage anybody I've
[35:25.340 --> 35:29.260]  ever seen in modern times in the military and then he came out last year on
[35:29.260 --> 35:36.700]  Al Jazeera and other platforms and he said look Obama basically ordered us to
[35:36.700 --> 35:40.740]  help al Qaeda to help ISIS and that's who we've been fighting on the side up for
[35:40.740 --> 35:45.340]  years and the reporters said oh my god so they didn't know he says no they knew
[35:45.340 --> 35:51.900]  and ordered that he talked about the elephant in the room in 2012 your agency
[35:51.900 --> 35:55.860]  was saying quote the Salafists the Muslim Brotherhood and al Qaeda in Iraq
[35:55.860 --> 36:00.900]  are the major forces driving the insurgents in Syria in 2012 the US was
[36:00.900 --> 36:04.860]  helping coordinate arms transfers to those same groups why did you not stop
[36:04.860 --> 36:08.820]  that if you're worried about the rise of quote unquote I mean I hate to say it's
[36:08.820 --> 36:14.180]  not my job but that my job was to was to ensure that the that the accuracy of
[36:14.180 --> 36:17.860]  our intelligence that was being presented was was as good as it could be
[36:17.860 --> 36:24.460]  and I will tell you it goes before 2012 I mean when we're when we're in Iraq and
[36:24.460 --> 36:27.860]  we still had decisions to be made before there was a decision to pull out of Iraq
[36:27.860 --> 36:33.100]  in 2011 I mean it was very clear what were we what we were going to face well
[36:33.100 --> 36:36.660]  just to clarify once more you are basically saying that even in government
[36:36.660 --> 36:40.260]  at the time you knew those groups were around you saw this analysis and you were
[36:40.260 --> 36:44.900]  arguing against it but who wasn't listening I think I think the administration
[36:44.900 --> 36:49.620]  the administration turned a blind eye to your analysis they turned a blind eye I
[36:49.620 --> 36:52.980]  think it was a decision I think it was a willful decision a willful decision to
[36:52.980 --> 36:56.700]  go supported insurgency that had Salafist al Qaeda a willful decision to do
[36:56.700 --> 37:00.740]  what they're doing which which you have to really you have to really ask the
[37:00.740 --> 37:05.940]  president what is it that he actually is doing with the with the policy that is
[37:05.940 --> 37:10.220]  in place because it is very very confusing I'm sitting here today Maddie
[37:10.220 --> 37:14.060]  and I don't I can't tell you exactly what that is and I've been at this for a
[37:14.060 --> 37:18.300]  long time what Seymour Hirsch has written about what what what we broke what
[37:18.300 --> 37:22.500]  Colonel Schaefer has talked about with what Steve Pachanik has talked about he
[37:22.500 --> 37:26.500]  was the head of defense intelligence in the middle of all this and here he is
[37:26.500 --> 37:32.340]  exposing it on international television that shows courage and if he'll expose
[37:32.340 --> 37:38.540]  the nexus point between criminal elements in our government bipartisan John
[37:38.540 --> 37:42.900]  McCain Obama Hillary arming radical jihadists to take over Libya parts of
[37:42.900 --> 37:46.340]  Syria Iraq you name it and show that they're working with Saudi Arabia to
[37:46.340 --> 37:50.100]  portray this nation in Europe he gets my support right there because he's also
[37:50.100 --> 37:54.140]  talking about the plan for a European caliphate he talked about the plans to
[37:54.140 --> 37:58.740]  flush with migrants for destabilization he basically got in trouble from Obama
[37:58.740 --> 38:05.620]  and taken out in 2014 despite the fact he was an innovator despite the fact he
[38:05.620 --> 38:09.700]  was a Democrat because he kept saying radical Islam radical Islam well
[38:09.700 --> 38:13.820]  orthodox Islam is radical Islam he's not even going further enough saying that
[38:13.820 --> 38:20.380]  but he got removed for saying radical Islam when it is Islam that is engaged
[38:20.380 --> 38:25.700]  in hundreds and hundreds of terror attacks and it's Sunni based funded by
[38:25.700 --> 38:30.340]  Saudi Arabia so the word is right now he's at the top of the list and Trump
[38:30.340 --> 38:35.620]  could announce by Friday they're planning the current word is Trump takes his
[38:35.620 --> 38:39.460]  mind obviously he's an innovative finger himself that by Friday or Saturday
[38:39.460 --> 38:43.420]  they're gonna be announcing the VP and that right now Michael T Flynn is right
[38:43.420 --> 38:48.500]  up there at the top so is Jeff Sessions but not at the very top anymore he's
[38:48.500 --> 38:56.620]  still on the top three names Michael T Flynn don't forget what he said on Al
[38:56.620 --> 39:01.400]  Jazeera don't forget the article is also linked on info wars.com because if we
[39:01.400 --> 39:04.860]  could show that our own government is financing black lives matter and ISIS
[39:04.860 --> 39:10.140]  and al Qaeda to destabilize the world and bring in more control we can really
[39:10.140 --> 39:15.300]  reverse a lot of the activities that the social engineers are involved with
[39:15.300 --> 39:23.980]  I'm Alex Jones now back to M4's nightly news and here in the studio I'm David
[39:23.980 --> 39:27.780]  Knight and as Alex was just talking about the upcoming convention it's
[39:27.780 --> 39:30.340]  important to remember some of these other names that are coming up there of
[39:30.340 --> 39:36.660]  course we have Newt Gingrich we have Governor Pence and it's interesting that
[39:36.660 --> 39:40.700]  both of these guys I believe if Trump were to pick them it would be a
[39:40.700 --> 39:45.940]  repudiation of the reasons in my opinion to vote for Trump and that is you know
[39:45.940 --> 39:50.820]  he's standing for closing the open borders he's standing against these
[39:50.820 --> 39:55.420]  globalist trade deals that are going to destroy our sovereignty that's something
[39:55.420 --> 40:00.460]  that Senator Sessions has been very consistent very strong on but it's
[40:00.460 --> 40:05.540]  something that Pence and Newt Gingrich have not now Pence has opposed the open
[40:05.540 --> 40:11.940]  borders Newt Gingrich hasn't but he is both of them have been big so-called
[40:11.940 --> 40:16.900]  free trade guys free trade in the sense of NAFTA or CAFTA the Central American
[40:16.900 --> 40:20.260]  Free Trade Agreement which Pence supported Pence also has publicly
[40:20.260 --> 40:24.820]  supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership as has Newt Gingrich but then when
[40:24.820 --> 40:28.460]  Newt Gingrich started sniffing around the vice presidency he changed his
[40:28.460 --> 40:33.460]  position on that issue so I think that it would be a major betrayal of the
[40:33.460 --> 40:37.180]  principles that Donald Trump has espoused to pick either of those I still
[40:37.180 --> 40:41.660]  hope that it is Senator Sessions he is a man of unimpeachable integrity he has
[40:41.660 --> 40:47.180]  always stood for the Constitution I'll never forget his questioning of Leon
[40:47.180 --> 40:50.740]  Panetta who at the time was Defense Secretary he's been Defense Secretary
[40:50.740 --> 40:54.780]  and CIA Secretary questioning him on the conditions under which our government
[40:54.780 --> 40:59.140]  would go to war as the Obama administration saw would you seek
[40:59.140 --> 41:05.260]  Congress's vote or and of course Panetta said well we'd let you know what we decide
[41:05.260 --> 41:08.700]  but we would talk to the UN and we'd talk to NATO and make our decision let
[41:08.700 --> 41:13.660]  you know and Senator Sessions was like I can't believe what I'm hearing you were
[41:13.660 --> 41:17.940]  a congressman you swore an oath to the Constitution what's a matter with you so
[41:17.940 --> 41:23.540]  he's a person of integrity he's the only senator who read these sovereignty
[41:23.540 --> 41:27.260]  destroying trade agreements the Trans-Pacific the transatlantic
[41:27.260 --> 41:32.140]  partnerships and he lectured Congress on it before they voted with the trade
[41:32.140 --> 41:36.900]  promotion authority to ignore the constitutional process of ratifying
[41:36.900 --> 41:40.140]  treaties just as they don't care what the process is for going to war they
[41:40.140 --> 41:43.860]  don't care what the process is for ratifying a treaty the treaty is
[41:43.860 --> 41:47.860]  ratified under the Constitution with two-thirds of the Senate voting for it
[41:47.860 --> 41:50.740]  says nothing about the House of Representatives what these people did
[41:50.740 --> 41:53.580]  was they said well we're just going to go with a simple majority but don't
[41:53.580 --> 41:57.660]  worry we'll throw in the House of Representatives as well that's not the
[41:57.660 --> 42:02.700]  constitutional process also they shut down any debate any amendment any
[42:02.700 --> 42:06.780]  filibusters they shut down any means that would block these trade agreements
[42:06.780 --> 42:09.580]  from coming to the floor they have to come to the floor when it's in a short
[42:09.580 --> 42:14.380]  period of time once they are sent over by the president to be signed they have
[42:14.380 --> 42:19.900]  destroyed and thumbed their noses at the Constitution and the only senator who
[42:19.900 --> 42:25.020]  stood up and said anything about that was senator Sessions and he took the
[42:25.020 --> 42:31.100]  time to put together a presentation with a big whiteboard behind him actually
[42:31.100 --> 42:35.780]  wasn't whiteboard it was a series of papers that he had printed up to try to
[42:35.780 --> 42:40.060]  educate the congressman and it isn't the problem that they're ignorant they just
[42:40.060 --> 42:45.580]  don't care they're bought off by these large financial interests as Bernie
[42:45.580 --> 42:49.940]  Sanders and Hillary Clinton are and you can see that today when Bernie Sanders
[42:49.940 --> 42:55.500]  supports Hillary Clinton he didn't get anything on the opposition to these
[42:55.500 --> 43:01.060]  sovereignty destroying jobs destroying trade deals now thinking liberals are
[43:01.060 --> 43:06.060]  going to understand that they need to understand what is at issue here and
[43:06.060 --> 43:10.140]  that is a that is a very important thing now as we look forward to the
[43:10.140 --> 43:15.540]  convention as I mentioned in the last segment one of these legal challenges to
[43:15.540 --> 43:21.940]  the primaries who actually have these arrogant Republican delegates who say
[43:21.940 --> 43:26.620]  your votes don't matter this is a guy basically we could call it the super
[43:26.620 --> 43:33.140]  delegate lawsuit this is Bo Carell and you know I put out feel I contacted all
[43:33.140 --> 43:39.140]  three of these people the guy Hogan as well as unruh and this Bo Carell guy
[43:39.140 --> 43:44.020]  said come on let's talk about this let's talk about how your rights trump those
[43:44.020 --> 43:48.580]  of the voters okay they say oh it's a private club this is our own organization
[43:48.580 --> 43:52.980]  and it's not a public thing we should not be subject to any laws except that
[43:52.980 --> 43:57.580]  they use their monopoly or we should say their duopoly status these two major
[43:57.580 --> 44:02.580]  parties to thoroughly control the election process and they also use
[44:02.580 --> 44:07.020]  taxpayer money to run these elections and they tell everybody that it's an
[44:07.020 --> 44:10.900]  election but then when the election is held they go back behind closed doors
[44:10.900 --> 44:15.660]  and Cruz starts selecting his delegates this guy by the way was a Cruz person
[44:15.660 --> 44:20.860]  doing these dirty tricks as is unruh and I don't know about Hogan who he was
[44:20.860 --> 44:23.660]  supporting but that's the kind of corruption we're seeing and we see that
[44:23.660 --> 44:28.180]  kind of corruption within the Democrat Party understand the Democrat Party did
[44:28.180 --> 44:33.460]  their bias that they did their their private dance up front if you will okay
[44:33.460 --> 44:37.060]  Hillary started out with 15% of the delegates that she needed and every one
[44:37.060 --> 44:41.180]  of these states 10 to 15% of delegates were set up as super delegates and then
[44:41.180 --> 44:46.300]  all of the Democrat states were done proportionally that meant that a
[44:46.300 --> 44:52.180]  challenger had to beat her by 10 to 15% in the popular vote to even break even
[44:52.180 --> 44:57.140]  on the delegates that's how they rig their position okay the Republicans on
[44:57.140 --> 45:01.140]  the other hand they did most of theirs after the fact so you would have an
[45:01.140 --> 45:05.300]  election and then after the fact they would come in with Ted Cruz and quietly
[45:05.300 --> 45:10.300]  try to appoint their people instead of people who supported the person that
[45:10.300 --> 45:13.820]  everybody voted for so if you voted for Trump wouldn't you think that Trump would
[45:13.820 --> 45:17.060]  get people who are loyal to him so if they have a brokered convention they
[45:17.060 --> 45:20.940]  would fight it that way so now it looks as the if that is going to be shut down
[45:20.940 --> 45:24.940]  that was one of the last efforts they had to shut that down so it's going to
[45:24.940 --> 45:28.460]  be interesting to see how that develops this convention coverage both of these
[45:28.460 --> 45:36.140]  conventions are going to be very interesting there is going to be a lot
[45:36.140 --> 45:39.700]  possibly violent I don't know I don't think we're going to I don't think we've
[45:39.700 --> 45:44.340]  seen anything like these conventions since the 1968 Democrat conventions in
[45:44.340 --> 45:47.580]  Chicago those riots that were there I think we're going to see a lot of that
[45:47.580 --> 45:50.860]  happening now coming up in the program we're going to talk about police reform
[45:50.860 --> 45:54.100]  we're going to talk about the killer robots we're also going to talk about the
[45:54.100 --> 46:00.100]  killer self-crashing cars we've had a third crash from Tesla and the SEC is
[46:00.100 --> 46:05.900]  also taking a look at Tesla and the fact that they made a lot of money in the
[46:05.900 --> 46:11.700]  stock market in the nearly two months that they waited before making public
[46:11.700 --> 46:16.540]  the issues that they had with autopilot remember autopilot is a key selling
[46:16.540 --> 46:20.740]  feature of their cars and if you don't tell people that you're having problems
[46:20.740 --> 46:25.860]  with this if you cover that up and you make major trade deals on the stock
[46:25.860 --> 46:30.340]  market the SEC is starting to get interested in that they've had the
[46:30.340 --> 46:34.020]  Department of Transportation in Washington running interference for
[46:34.020 --> 46:38.500]  the Silicon Valley car manufacturers like Google and Tesla saying we're not
[46:38.500 --> 46:42.180]  going to allow states and local communities to establish safety laws
[46:42.180 --> 46:46.700]  we're going to shut those down just as they do for GMO regulation right we
[46:46.700 --> 46:50.420]  want to know what's in our food so a lot of states and communities have started
[46:50.420 --> 46:54.260]  putting in GMO labeling laws they said now we're tired of trying to fight these
[46:54.260 --> 46:58.460]  things one by one we've lost a couple of these so let's just shut this down at
[46:58.460 --> 47:03.580]  the federal level so they got together with big agra and they're they're going
[47:03.580 --> 47:08.580]  to put pressure on the government we've had the dark act come up to shut down
[47:08.580 --> 47:14.020]  the truth about what is in your food in the same way they don't like the fact
[47:14.020 --> 47:17.580]  that people in California are starting to look at all the accidents around these
[47:17.580 --> 47:22.700]  cars that we're told are going to put an end to all deaths on the highway you've
[47:22.700 --> 47:26.980]  heard that right for that many times 30,000 plus people killed every year on
[47:26.980 --> 47:30.300]  the highways we're just going to stop all of that completely these cars will
[47:30.300 --> 47:35.260]  not make mistakes and we've been pointing out how much of a lie that is
[47:35.260 --> 47:38.660]  from the very beginning you don't think your computer crashes you don't think
[47:38.660 --> 47:41.660]  your iPhone crashes you don't think you have problems when they update the
[47:41.660 --> 47:46.140]  software on your iPhone and now the old model no longer works they're taking
[47:46.140 --> 47:50.460]  that same attitude and they're going to put it on the road driving your car so
[47:50.460 --> 47:54.260]  we're gonna take a look at that as well as some of the ethical issues that were
[47:54.260 --> 48:01.820]  exposed with the killer robots in Dallas also the Pokemon go augmented reality
[48:01.820 --> 48:06.140]  what is that about what are the issues behind that we had a article yesterday
[48:06.140 --> 48:12.980]  from Kit Daniels talking about how Incutel the venture capital firm of the
[48:12.980 --> 48:19.540]  CIA was had some connections with the company that was behind this new piece
[48:19.540 --> 48:23.420]  of software it is truly gone viral we've never seen anything like this it's
[48:23.420 --> 48:27.300]  added about eight billion dollars worth of market cap value to Nintendo it's
[48:27.300 --> 48:33.020]  incredibly huge okay and half a day it became the number one selling app on
[48:33.020 --> 48:38.300]  Apple and understand it's very different from virtual virtual reality it
[48:38.300 --> 48:43.260]  doesn't create an entire reality system that you put on blinders and move around
[48:43.260 --> 48:50.740]  in a room instead you go out and you walk around and it shows on your phone
[48:50.740 --> 48:54.980]  where you really are but then it augments that and puts little Pokemon
[48:54.980 --> 48:58.460]  characters that you can collect and then take to other places and have battles
[48:58.460 --> 49:02.620]  with them that's the idea behind augmented reality at first glance you
[49:02.620 --> 49:05.620]  look at it you say well great it gets the kids off of the couch and it gets them
[49:05.620 --> 49:10.260]  out and around but then there's other issues issues of privacy and so we're
[49:10.260 --> 49:14.980]  gonna take a look at several different technological issues that are that are
[49:14.980 --> 49:19.700]  presenting themselves to society at this moment but before we do we've had
[49:19.700 --> 49:24.980]  Bernie Sanders endorsing Hillary Clinton we've got Loretta Lynch at this
[49:24.980 --> 49:30.620]  moment talking to Congress about her tarmac teta-teta with Bill and why
[49:30.620 --> 49:33.980]  Hillary is not being indicted and I think maybe what we should have is a
[49:33.980 --> 49:39.140]  t-shirt that instead of Hillary for prison maybe Hillary for privilege you
[49:39.140 --> 49:43.820]  know when you look at Bill Ayers the guy who popularized this whole idea with
[49:43.820 --> 49:48.900]  the weather underground and the students for democratic society back in the
[49:48.900 --> 49:54.460]  1960s this whole idea of white privilege who weaponized that idea this is one of
[49:54.460 --> 49:59.180]  the most privileged white people you have ever seen okay this is a guy whose
[49:59.180 --> 50:03.780]  dad was incredibly wealthy who was able to go on a terrorist spree and then a
[50:03.780 --> 50:07.500]  scape all prosecution that's white privilege okay that's real privilege
[50:07.500 --> 50:11.500]  and Hillary is the same kind of person look at this story from the new
[50:11.500 --> 50:16.540]  American Hillary Clinton contends systemic bias in the US criminal justice
[50:16.540 --> 50:22.020]  system targets blacks and it's like well I guess exhibit a would be Hillary
[50:22.020 --> 50:27.820]  Clinton because as she's pontificating about how blacks are unfairly targeted
[50:27.820 --> 50:33.900]  we also see that a black congresswoman Corrine Brown has been indicted for
[50:33.900 --> 50:39.980]  guess what using a phony charity you mean like the Clinton Foundation to scam
[50:39.980 --> 50:46.540]  money from people and she is not going to get off she's facing 357 years in
[50:46.540 --> 50:51.980]  prison how's that for disparity between the white privileged grand mal
[50:51.980 --> 50:57.420]  Hillary Clinton and a black congressman stay with Congress will say what this

[55:30.660 --> 55:35.980]  let's talk about Hilary the woman who says that there is so much bias against
[55:35.980 --> 55:41.820]  black people and yet here we see a black congresswoman Kareem Brown who's been
[55:41.820 --> 55:48.700]  indicted who's looking at 357 years in prison for doing what she took $800,000
[55:48.700 --> 55:54.420]  and donations to a supposed charitable organization one door for education was
[55:54.420 --> 55:59.860]  the name of it but she was accused of using that as a personal slush fund does
[55:59.860 --> 56:05.380]  that sound familiar does that sound like the Clintons and yet what does Hilary
[56:05.380 --> 56:12.580]  get nothing we want to talk about talk about white privilege that's Hilary
[56:12.580 --> 56:19.180]  Clinton now we've got as another example of how she is setting all new precedents
[56:19.180 --> 56:23.580]  how as I've said in the past you know they've taken this religion of national
[56:23.580 --> 56:27.620]  security they've used it to destroy our due process they've used it to destroy
[56:27.620 --> 56:32.740]  our legal system our privacy our bill of rights and yet here we have Hilary
[56:32.740 --> 56:39.940]  Clinton thumbing her nose at that state religion but we have some here at US
[56:39.940 --> 56:44.020]  News report they say attorneys for people who have allegedly mishandled
[56:44.020 --> 56:47.260]  classified information saying they want the same deal that Hilary Clinton got
[56:47.260 --> 56:51.780]  and this is a defense attorney who works for national security whistleblowers
[56:51.780 --> 56:55.900]  and he points out that he thinks that he can get a Clinton deal for his clients
[56:55.900 --> 57:01.340]  in the future he said in 2015 shortly after CIA director David Petraeus got a
[57:01.340 --> 57:05.940]  plea bargain which was just a slap on the wrist you know probation and a small
[57:05.940 --> 57:11.100]  fine because he shared highly classified information with his mistress he said we
[57:11.100 --> 57:14.740]  absolutely got on the phone to the prosecutor said hey we want the Petraeus
[57:14.740 --> 57:19.820]  sentence we want the commensurates parallel sentence and he said we got it
[57:19.820 --> 57:25.940]  just a small thing so he says I fully expect that we're not going to see jail
[57:25.940 --> 57:31.700]  time for any of my clients who violate national security now understand some of
[57:31.700 --> 57:35.020]  these people should not be going to jail we've talked about Thomas Drake we've
[57:35.020 --> 57:38.980]  talked about how they manufactured charges against him Hilary Clinton's
[57:38.980 --> 57:44.140]  correspondence that she was using to cover up her secret deals that was born
[57:44.140 --> 57:47.380]  classified when she's talking to a head of state and the private conversations
[57:47.380 --> 57:51.420]  that they have that are recorded there that's born classified we also saw her
[57:51.420 --> 57:55.500]  instructing employees to remove the classified heading so it could be
[57:55.500 --> 57:59.460]  transmitted that was in the emails as well and yet in the case of Thomas Drake
[57:59.460 --> 58:03.420]  who was a bona fide whistleblower who was talking about how the NSA was
[58:03.420 --> 58:08.020]  violating the Constitution violating even the foreign intelligence surveillance
[58:08.020 --> 58:11.820]  act they went to his house and they found a couple of documents as we've
[58:11.820 --> 58:15.540]  mentioned this before they said hey this isn't classified but you should have
[58:15.540 --> 58:18.500]  known that it should have been classified it should have been classified you
[58:18.500 --> 58:20.900]  should have known it another one they said well it's not classified they
[58:20.900 --> 58:26.140]  classified the same day then unclassified it three months later that's the
[58:26.140 --> 58:30.860]  double standard and it isn't just a racial one it's one standard for the
[58:30.860 --> 58:35.660]  people at the top the corrupt criminals you know a government rots from the head
[58:35.660 --> 58:38.540]  down and that's what we're seeing with the Clintons stay with us we'll be right
[58:38.540 --> 58:47.900]  back thank you for listening to GCN visit GCNLive.com today

[59:04.340 --> 59:07.780]  was kind of run down you know I just didn't feel like I was gonna make it and
[59:07.780 --> 59:11.060]  I really want to do a good job on the interview I got my bottle of brain force
[59:11.060 --> 59:15.100]  right there pop two of them and about 20 minutes later it's like being everything

[59:19.700 --> 59:23.180]  about it find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such
[59:23.180 --> 59:27.660]  high praise because it really does have the best organic based systems that
[59:27.660 --> 59:30.860]  will blow your socks off I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while
[59:30.860 --> 59:34.060]  but I probably could not have done it without brain force I went home about

[01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:11.020]  they took my saddle in Houston broke my leg in the Saturday lost my wife and a
[01:00:11.020 --> 01:00:20.500]  girlfriend somewhere along the way in defense of human liberty alex jones
[01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:29.700]  welcome back to the alex jones show I want to play a short clip of Bernie
[01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:34.420]  Sanders talking about the Democrat platform but before we do want to
[01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:37.580]  continue with what I was talking about with Hillary Clinton of course alex
[01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:40.860]  jones is going to be joining us in the next segment and he's going to be talking
[01:00:40.860 --> 01:00:45.780]  about the pokemon go phenomenon what's behind that we're both going to be
[01:00:45.780 --> 01:00:49.340]  talking about that in the next segment but again talking about Hillary and
[01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:54.700]  talking about her special privilege the corruption that she embodies we now
[01:00:54.700 --> 01:00:58.980]  have an interesting thing that is developing we have the judicial watch
[01:00:58.980 --> 01:01:03.940]  people who have been following very closely and have really exposed a lot
[01:01:03.940 --> 01:01:07.220]  of stuff with their freedom of information requests they've been done a
[01:01:07.220 --> 01:01:11.740]  great job of investigating of uncovering the corruption of the
[01:01:11.740 --> 01:01:17.060]  Clintons now a judge has given Hillary Clinton until today so we'll see what's
[01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:20.540]  going to happen with this this is a story from world net daily to reveal why
[01:01:20.540 --> 01:01:26.660]  she should not be forced to testify in a federal case about her aid and we put
[01:01:26.660 --> 01:01:32.060]  that term in quotes Huma Abedin double-dipping employment at the state
[01:01:32.060 --> 01:01:37.900]  department okay so again we've got a black congresswoman who is facing 357
[01:01:37.900 --> 01:01:44.580]  years in prison because she had a bogus charitable foundation you know kind of
[01:01:44.580 --> 01:01:49.620]  like the Clinton Foundation except she got $800,000 instead of tens of
[01:01:49.620 --> 01:01:54.100]  millions of dollars or maybe hundreds of millions of dollars as the Clintons may
[01:01:54.100 --> 01:01:58.500]  have done over the years instead of just being dismissed she's going to be
[01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:03.780]  looking at 357 years in prison possibly that's the double standard we see and so
[01:02:03.780 --> 01:02:09.020]  this judicial watch is asking a federal judge for permission to put Hillary
[01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:14.460]  Clinton under oath isn't that interesting because one of the most
[01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:21.660]  interesting short segments out of the questioning of Comey on for the
[01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:25.140]  congressional committee was they asked him point blank I think it was Trey
[01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:31.020]  Gowdy said to the FBI director did Hillary Clinton lie and Comey just kind
[01:02:31.020 --> 01:02:37.420]  of paused for about three seconds and then he says to us no she lied to
[01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:40.100]  everybody else she lied to Congress she committed perjury in Congress of course
[01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:45.020]  you know they could refer that to guess who Loretta Lynch and the FBI to
[01:02:45.020 --> 01:02:47.940]  investigate you think they would no they're not going to investigate her
[01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:52.420]  perjury before Congress she gets a free pass she gets a coup for a right
[01:02:52.420 --> 01:02:57.540]  nobody's get out of jail card for free okay that's what Hillary Clinton gets and
[01:02:57.540 --> 01:03:02.180]  all these things but he said no she didn't lie to the FBI and I would have
[01:03:02.180 --> 01:03:06.220]  to say I would really like to see the transcripts of the recordings of that
[01:03:06.220 --> 01:03:09.740]  oh that's right there's not any transcripts of recording in other words
[01:03:09.740 --> 01:03:14.980]  did she really tell them the truth did she lie under oath or did they just not
[01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:19.700]  ask her the relevant questions because he began by talking about how she had
[01:03:19.700 --> 01:03:25.100]  violated security laws so that she had sent and received classified email I
[01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:29.340]  mean that's a felony did he not ask her that did you send to receive the
[01:03:29.340 --> 01:03:34.340]  classified emails she said over and over again how she did not do that and yet
[01:03:34.340 --> 01:03:38.700]  maybe they didn't ask her that but judicial watch is going to ask this
[01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:43.380]  judge to put her under oath so they can ask her questions about this illegal
[01:03:43.380 --> 01:03:50.300]  double dipping of her close close aide Huma Abedin okay now also coming up with
[01:03:50.300 --> 01:03:54.860]  this as they point out on this another article from W&D they say that FBI
[01:03:54.860 --> 01:04:01.060]  director let her walk but one of the things that he said was that she was
[01:04:01.060 --> 01:04:06.020]  extremely careless he in testimony said that she was not just careless but he
[01:04:06.020 --> 01:04:08.780]  implied that she didn't really understand the importance of the
[01:04:08.780 --> 01:04:13.100]  information that she was handling and they pointed on this article well that's
[01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:17.100]  something that we've heard from people who know the Clintons very well Bill
[01:04:17.100 --> 01:04:21.500]  Clinton's childhood friend former lover Dolly Kyle has long alleged that Hillary
[01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:27.460]  Clinton suffers from cognitive impairment so the lady who dresses like
[01:04:27.460 --> 01:04:31.260]  chairman bow who wants us to see her as her grandmother I guess we could call
[01:04:31.260 --> 01:04:36.220]  her grandma now that is out there but don't worry they're going to cover that
[01:04:36.220 --> 01:04:41.700]  up as well no matter what she does even Facebook covers for Hillary Clinton
[01:04:41.700 --> 01:04:46.740]  especially Facebook they've now taken down a page that had means that
[01:04:46.740 --> 01:04:50.900]  mock Hillary Clinton can't do that we can put up memorials black lives matter
[01:04:50.900 --> 01:04:53.220]  but they're not going to say anything about the dead police at their
[01:04:53.220 --> 01:04:59.260]  headquarters stay with us Alex Jones be right back talking about Pokemon Go
[01:04:59.260 --> 01:05:04.100]  let's face it most of us are totally addicted to our cell phones but recent
[01:05:04.100 --> 01:05:08.060]  studies link cell phone use to major health issues including brain cancer
[01:05:08.060 --> 01:05:12.460]  experts say parents and expecting mothers need to be extra careful doctors
[01:05:12.460 --> 01:05:16.740]  say the infant brain even while in the womb is especially vulnerable so keep
[01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:20.460]  the phone away from your abdomen especially toward the end of pregnancy
[01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:24.660]  and for men using a cell phone for as little as an hour a day is literally
[01:05:24.660 --> 01:05:29.220]  cooking your sperm lowering sperm count levels so much that conceiving a child
[01:05:29.220 --> 01:05:32.780]  could be difficult this is one of those times you want to keep it out of your
[01:05:32.780 --> 01:05:36.260]  pants and for those of us who use our cell phones before bed know that the
[01:05:36.260 --> 01:05:40.340]  screen light is actually disrupting your sleep rhythms this causes insomnia and
[01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:44.580]  slow some metabolism hello week gain generally speaking when cell phones are
[01:05:44.580 --> 01:05:48.620]  on they're constantly emitting radio frequency radiation so keep your phone
[01:05:48.620 --> 01:05:52.300]  in airplane mode when you can keep the phone at least two feet away from your
[01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:56.060]  body use headphones and when you're not on your phone keep it as far away from

[01:07:17.940 --> 01:07:20.500]  gas generators solar generators run silently
[01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:24.260]  emit no fumes or gases and produce electricity from the Sun whether it's

[01:08:04.100 --> 01:08:12.500]  live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[01:08:16.580 --> 01:08:22.860]  it's called augmented reality I thought humans interfacing with this
[01:08:22.860 --> 01:08:27.540]  incredible third dimension having sight having smell having taste having touch
[01:08:27.540 --> 01:08:32.860]  having emotions and feelings inside our hearts I thought that was augmented
[01:08:32.860 --> 01:08:37.500]  reality I thought that was consciousness but now we're told it's the
[01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:43.140]  number one search five six days running Pokemon go in fact some of the amazing
[01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:48.060]  crew members at our own officer playing it and I'm not judging them for checking
[01:08:48.060 --> 01:08:51.260]  out something new and interesting my kids have played Pokemon you know the
[01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:55.060]  card game years ago you have these little monsters that you play against each
[01:08:55.060 --> 01:08:59.180]  other you've got to go find the monsters capture and train them all the rest of
[01:08:59.180 --> 01:09:02.700]  it whatever board games have been around chess games been around three four
[01:09:02.700 --> 01:09:08.540]  thousand years that's great the problem is is that we see more and more people
[01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:13.940]  living in second life buying Ferraris with real money that don't really exist
[01:09:13.940 --> 01:09:20.060]  forming fake relationships in cyberspace and becoming very unsuccessful in the
[01:09:20.060 --> 01:09:25.660]  real world and we see the social engineers pushing as hard as they can to
[01:09:25.660 --> 01:09:30.380]  get people to tune out of the real world this incredible planet hurtling
[01:09:30.380 --> 01:09:35.140]  through space and our amazing moon and all the other things that are happening
[01:09:35.140 --> 01:09:44.380]  on our planet and dial into artificial systems created by Nintendo or by
[01:09:44.380 --> 01:09:52.820]  Microsoft or by Google or by Apple they are creating the universes in which we
[01:09:52.820 --> 01:09:59.220]  interface instead of humans living in the real universe and being creative
[01:09:59.220 --> 01:10:05.540]  sentient beings yourself they are building false realities into which they
[01:10:05.540 --> 01:10:12.900]  want to induct you so they can play God so I'm not saying anybody's bad who
[01:10:12.900 --> 01:10:17.820]  wants to play video games or who wants to be involved in a world of warcraft or
[01:10:17.820 --> 01:10:24.420]  any of them all I'm saying is the metrics are there our IQs are dropping the
[01:10:24.420 --> 01:10:31.340]  screen time is lowering our IQs our synapses are collapsing humanity is in
[01:10:31.340 --> 01:10:37.900]  crisis and Pokemon Go is illustrating my own fact ambulance drivers EMTs across
[01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:42.020]  not just the US but the world are saying that suddenly because there's
[01:10:42.020 --> 01:10:46.340]  augmented reality kids that have never been outside their house that spend less
[01:10:46.340 --> 01:10:50.700]  time on average than prisoners do outside are suddenly out in the real
[01:10:50.700 --> 01:10:55.260]  world looking for these mythical monsters they can show up for their
[01:10:55.260 --> 01:10:59.660]  friends and collect more so in a way the matrix is actually backfiring on
[01:10:59.660 --> 01:11:04.860]  itself as it attempts to go out and take over reality that's what Microsoft and
[01:11:04.860 --> 01:11:08.580]  others said they want for decades and have every real area of the world with
[01:11:08.580 --> 01:11:12.700]  this whole data list this whole information cube around it to track what
[01:11:12.700 --> 01:11:17.060]  you do but in a way it's actually backfiring as people go out into the
[01:11:17.060 --> 01:11:22.940]  real world themselves looking for the false reality but I can't get over the
[01:11:22.940 --> 01:11:28.620]  image of brain dead zombies that we see on TV walking looking at their phones
[01:11:28.620 --> 01:11:34.860]  going into traffic I can't help but think about the images of people that
[01:11:34.860 --> 01:11:39.780]  walk into fountains at malls or that drive off cliffs while they're watching
[01:11:39.780 --> 01:11:44.980]  their GPFs or drive into raging rivers because they're making this their
[01:11:44.980 --> 01:11:51.300]  entire consciousness I mean I'm out here supposedly at a nearby golf course
[01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:56.100]  looking for one of these Pokemon's and I'm told that it's magically laid some
[01:11:56.100 --> 01:11:59.740]  eggs about a hundred yards over there and then I can go over there and watch
[01:11:59.740 --> 01:12:04.460]  it hatch and capture it for myself but in truth it's not really there it's being
[01:12:04.460 --> 01:12:08.420]  geolocated I'm being tracked everything I'm doing by the way by this app and
[01:12:08.420 --> 01:12:12.660]  admits it's been hacking millions of people's phones and I'm now feeding this
[01:12:12.660 --> 01:12:16.820]  data to the matrix of where I am and what I'm doing to find some mythical
[01:12:16.820 --> 01:12:22.340]  projection that it's shooting on to my phone again this is giving all of my
[01:12:22.340 --> 01:12:28.180]  personal privacy all of my personal power over to Nintendo to sell my habits
[01:12:28.180 --> 01:12:32.940]  to sell my behaviors to sell my data to whoever they want the studies don't lie
[01:12:32.940 --> 01:12:38.620]  this dehumanizes you this ends up destroying your humanity in the final
[01:12:38.620 --> 01:12:44.180]  equation if you use it in limited amounts sure it's interesting you can
[01:12:44.180 --> 01:12:48.260]  meet like-minded people that are into it I'm not judging anybody Lord knows I'm
[01:12:48.260 --> 01:12:53.580]  just simply pointing out we should ask ourselves why Pokemon has been more
[01:12:53.580 --> 01:12:59.540]  popular the last five six days than porn when I heard that the British exit
[01:12:59.540 --> 01:13:03.460]  from the euro was more popular than porn the only thing in years to beat that I
[01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:09.220]  was proud of the people anti-globalism is number one even above simulated
[01:13:09.220 --> 01:13:16.340]  procreation but the truth is porn is just like this it's simulated it isn't
[01:13:16.340 --> 01:13:20.860]  real you're living through somebody else's template somebody else's intercourse
[01:13:20.860 --> 01:13:26.700]  somebody else's activities that are then edited and presented and sold to you so
[01:13:26.700 --> 01:13:34.460]  while they live you sleep and that's all I'm saying every study every piece of
[01:13:34.460 --> 01:13:39.220]  research shows it that forest bathing and getting outdoors and being in the open
[01:13:39.220 --> 01:13:44.780]  air and looking up at the sky raises your awareness raises your IQ getting in
[01:13:44.780 --> 01:13:49.860]  the wind feeling the reality seeing the birds fly around in the air but I tell
[01:13:49.860 --> 01:13:55.660]  you it is sacrilege to the gamers and sacrilege to the TV heads who you get
[01:13:55.660 --> 01:13:59.260]  around and they don't talk about what's happening in the world they don't talk
[01:13:59.260 --> 01:14:01.780]  about what they're doing with men or women they don't talk about what they're
[01:14:01.780 --> 01:14:05.140]  doing with art they don't talk about hiking or camping trips they're going
[01:14:05.140 --> 01:14:09.780]  on they don't care about their work they don't care about the world they they're
[01:14:09.780 --> 01:14:13.980]  cynical and don't care about the new world order on average all they want to
[01:14:13.980 --> 01:14:17.980]  do is live in their fantasy land and I for one am sick and tired of that and
[01:14:17.980 --> 01:14:21.780]  I'm reaching into those people that are living in false worlds built by other
[01:14:21.780 --> 01:14:25.980]  people built by these gaming companies that make billions of dollars off of
[01:14:25.980 --> 01:14:31.140]  you that this is the ultimate form of slavery and let me be clear a lot of the
[01:14:31.140 --> 01:14:34.860]  big game companies are patriots a lot of the big game companies are listeners of
[01:14:34.860 --> 01:14:38.940]  mine my god I've been like eight or nine big video games over the years I've
[01:14:38.940 --> 01:14:42.300]  signed contracts and let them use my voice or image there's a lot of good
[01:14:42.300 --> 01:14:46.300]  messages in video games just like movies just like TV but there's some bad
[01:14:46.300 --> 01:14:51.700]  messages and the globalist are basically pushing this because they don't want you
[01:14:51.700 --> 01:15:00.020]  to be involved in the real world look it is kind of fun I'm gonna admit it to
[01:15:00.020 --> 01:15:04.780]  just not look at the sunset over there and I'll look at the sky or the moon and
[01:15:04.780 --> 01:15:09.340]  just start looking at this it's so much fun it's so neat wait a minute there's
[01:15:09.340 --> 01:15:13.580]  eggs over there there's there's something there's something there's
[01:15:13.580 --> 01:15:17.820]  something hatching actually this is pretty cool guys I'm into this over there
[01:15:17.820 --> 01:15:23.100]  it's it's oh my god oh my god I just found a new can't you see it over there
[01:15:23.100 --> 01:15:26.740]  it's right there and now I can see it for myself ladies and gentlemen right
[01:15:26.740 --> 01:15:32.860]  there Trigly Puff is the newest Pokemon it's given birth Trigly Puff is giving
[01:15:32.860 --> 01:15:40.300]  birth Trigly Puff is giving birth to a baby to a baby Darth Vader it's my own
[01:15:40.300 --> 01:15:43.780]  fantasy land I don't have to actually affect change the real world I can just
[01:15:43.780 --> 01:15:53.200]  believe whatever I want to be a star here oh my god I've actually changed my
[01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:59.580]  mind now that I'm in the matrix don't look outside the television or the
[01:15:59.580 --> 01:16:06.220]  internet of the computer only look into this world that's real this world this
[01:16:06.220 --> 01:16:12.580]  world where you could actually create something isn't real the only world
[01:16:12.580 --> 01:16:17.940]  that's real is the world where Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama and your
[01:16:17.940 --> 01:16:24.220]  trusted local professors tell you what words you're allowed to use so go back
[01:16:24.220 --> 01:16:30.380]  to your dorms and play Pokemon go and whatever you do don't hack into Pokemon
[01:16:30.380 --> 01:16:34.500]  and actually create your own characters whatever you do don't use their own
[01:16:34.500 --> 01:16:42.540]  memes and their own systems to wake people up just conform and pretend you
[01:16:42.540 --> 01:16:48.060]  were never conscious and you were never alive and whatever you do never visit
[01:16:48.060 --> 01:16:54.940]  all the internet is still somewhat free info wars dot com
[01:16:55.860 --> 01:17:01.020]  all right that's Alex Jones and he's out hunting Pokemon go now that's not
[01:17:01.020 --> 01:17:07.060]  what he's really doing but he broke that down and look the idea is this folks you
[01:17:07.060 --> 01:17:11.220]  can lose yourself in a virtual reality or you can lose yourself in an augmented
[01:17:11.220 --> 01:17:17.340]  reality the reality however is that we have to always be skeptical of how we
[01:17:17.340 --> 01:17:22.260]  view technology you know it doesn't really change ethics it doesn't really
[01:17:22.260 --> 01:17:27.420]  change liberty or privacy or safety even though they tell us that it does they
[01:17:27.420 --> 01:17:30.980]  tell us we're operating under new rules you know the Constitution doesn't apply
[01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:36.420]  because now we have computers no the same principles apply we still have
[01:17:36.420 --> 01:17:43.380]  human nature that's why the founders did such a good job of trying to not have
[01:17:43.380 --> 01:17:47.340]  power consolidated in one particular place but to divide it that was the
[01:17:47.340 --> 01:17:51.540]  whole point of the Constitution they understood human nature we're the ones
[01:17:51.540 --> 01:17:55.340]  who don't understand human nature we're the ones who don't understand the big
[01:17:55.340 --> 01:18:00.580]  issues of as I point out ethics morality liberty safety that's not a trade-off
[01:18:00.580 --> 01:18:04.500]  folks you know when when Trump tells us that he's going to that the choice now
[01:18:04.500 --> 01:18:09.980]  is between safety and chaos I'm concerned because I hear this all the time
[01:18:09.980 --> 01:18:14.700]  that we have to trade off our liberty for safety people that put a priority on
[01:18:14.700 --> 01:18:18.100]  safety I don't want to live in a safe country let me just put it that way I
[01:18:18.100 --> 01:18:24.700]  do not want to live in a safe country I want to live free I don't want people
[01:18:24.700 --> 01:18:29.260]  selling me self-crashing cars telling me that they're going to be safe no I
[01:18:29.260 --> 01:18:33.220]  want to be able to move about freely with my own vehicle when I want to go I
[01:18:33.220 --> 01:18:36.660]  don't want it I don't want to lose the ability to own a vehicle because they're
[01:18:36.660 --> 01:18:40.100]  going to make it prohibitively expensive I don't want to lose the ability to
[01:18:40.100 --> 01:18:44.820]  control my movement because they're going to say well you know the humans
[01:18:44.820 --> 01:18:49.700]  driving are the problem so now we have to have all the cars under government
[01:18:49.700 --> 01:18:55.380]  control that's where this is all headed folks now before we go back to I want to
[01:18:55.380 --> 01:18:58.580]  there's a couple things I want to say about Pokemon before we do we've got a
[01:18:58.580 --> 01:19:03.820]  link up to the story about dump the burn how Democrats are revolting after
[01:19:03.820 --> 01:19:08.580]  Bernie has showed himself to be revolting when he adores to Hillary
[01:19:08.580 --> 01:19:12.740]  Clinton it's up on the upper left of a drudge it's there under fans fume and
[01:19:12.740 --> 01:19:15.860]  here's some of the things they said that so disappointed Bernie sold out
[01:19:15.860 --> 01:19:21.020]  millions and many of us fell for it said one former fan never again he says
[01:19:21.020 --> 01:19:24.700]  another one says personally I don't think I'll support Hillary I don't trust her
[01:19:24.700 --> 01:19:31.100]  she said I can't see backing someone I don't believe in yeah yeah that's it
[01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:34.780]  that's the way it goes folks that's the way it's going to always go now when we
[01:19:34.780 --> 01:19:39.900]  come back we're going to take a look as I said about Pokemon we're gonna look at
[01:19:39.900 --> 01:19:44.140]  killer robots we're gonna look at killer self-crashing cars we'll be right back

[01:24:15.300 --> 01:24:20.860]  Pokemon go phenomenon here and some of the deeper issues behind it Alex Jones
[01:24:20.860 --> 01:24:26.940]  just talked about it how we are losing ourself into this virtual reality and
[01:24:26.940 --> 01:24:30.980]  missing out on life quite frankly but there's other dangers involved in this
[01:24:30.980 --> 01:24:36.060]  as well but before I do I want to tell you that we have now extended for one
[01:24:36.060 --> 01:24:41.420]  more day part of the July 4th mega cells now understand as we're going to be
[01:24:41.420 --> 01:24:48.420]  going to report in the two conventions Republican Democrat conventions this is
[01:24:48.420 --> 01:24:53.340]  one way that you could help to fuel the info war this is the way that we fund
[01:24:53.340 --> 01:24:56.980]  our operation now Alex could have funded the operation any number of ways we
[01:24:56.980 --> 01:25:00.140]  could have taken traditional commercial sponsors then we would have been
[01:25:00.140 --> 01:25:05.260]  captive to the vagaries of people who don't like what we report you can't
[01:25:05.260 --> 01:25:09.980]  remain independent that way we could have taken charitable donations or we
[01:25:09.980 --> 01:25:13.500]  could have taken government money but you know I really appreciate what Alex
[01:25:13.500 --> 01:25:18.140]  did what he did was he came up with products that addressed the needs that
[01:25:18.140 --> 01:25:24.700]  he sees out there having clean water clean air pure food having a backup food
[01:25:24.700 --> 01:25:28.180]  source all the sorts of things that we understand that we need in our lives to

[01:26:54.100 --> 01:26:58.700]  money I tell you it is a Wall Street Journal pointed out this Pokemon go
[01:26:58.700 --> 01:27:06.740]  thing is monster profits they had their market cap go up 25% and then an
[01:27:06.740 --> 01:27:12.820]  additional 13% today they're up eight billion dollars in market capitalization
[01:27:12.820 --> 01:27:17.340]  and that's a huge increase because now their total market cap is 30 billion
[01:27:17.340 --> 01:27:21.020]  dollars so just that one particular product to give you an idea of just how
[01:27:21.020 --> 01:27:27.020]  popular it is they report on RT they say it has almost surpassed Twitter and
[01:27:27.020 --> 01:27:31.460]  daily active users and this is just with the United States this is not talking
[01:27:31.460 --> 01:27:36.260]  about Europe okay it's not come online with this it's overtaken tender it's
[01:27:36.260 --> 01:27:41.060]  racked up more usage time than what's that snapchat Instagram and Nintendo
[01:27:41.060 --> 01:27:44.900]  value has increased as I point out by eight billion dollars okay and it hasn't
[01:27:44.900 --> 01:27:50.940]  even been out for a week yet now they point out that also on the US iPhone
[01:27:50.940 --> 01:27:54.980]  revenue they hit number one in just a half a day that's pretty much
[01:27:54.980 --> 01:27:59.420]  unprecedented look at this article they talk about how people have found a
[01:27:59.420 --> 01:28:04.660]  dead body I think it's out in Montana we've had a traffic chaos one guy says
[01:28:04.660 --> 01:28:08.420]  well I live in an old church he said that means many things today it means
[01:28:08.420 --> 01:28:12.540]  that my house is a Pokemon go Jim said this should be fascinating in other
[01:28:12.540 --> 01:28:17.580]  words he woke up to a crowd of people wandering around his house in his garden
[01:28:17.580 --> 01:28:22.380]  because they saw that his church had been flagged as a gym so basically go
[01:28:22.380 --> 01:28:26.780]  around you collect these little augmented reality characters and then you
[01:28:26.780 --> 01:28:30.420]  can take them somewhere and at a gym and you can have a fighting contest
[01:28:30.420 --> 01:28:34.140]  evidently with it another person says just witness to car accident because a
[01:28:34.140 --> 01:28:39.700]  guy was playing Pokemon and stopped in the road to catch one see that's where
[01:28:39.700 --> 01:28:43.820]  it becomes dangerous that's where you take yourself out of reality as I look
[01:28:43.820 --> 01:28:48.060]  at this article from the Hill Pokemon go craze swarms Capitol Hill they say
[01:28:48.060 --> 01:28:52.860]  that they've got all these staffers as well as tourists in the area are going
[01:28:52.860 --> 01:28:57.900]  all over these landmarks finding Pokemon and they say they have them at the
[01:28:57.900 --> 01:29:01.700]  Capitol building at the White House at the Pentagon and it's like that could
[01:29:01.700 --> 01:29:04.500]  be pretty dangerous you might want to have a talk to your kids
[01:29:04.500 --> 01:29:09.180]  Washington is one of these places where they shoot first and ask questions
[01:29:09.180 --> 01:29:15.540]  later unfortunately but I think really what concerns me about this is the idea
[01:29:15.540 --> 01:29:19.900]  that people don't really understand what is behind some of the geospatial
[01:29:19.900 --> 01:29:23.820]  intelligence and that was the article that Kit Daniels talked about yesterday
[01:29:23.820 --> 01:29:29.780]  the link to the CIA developer who was also linked to Incutel which is the
[01:29:29.780 --> 01:29:34.180]  venture capital firm of the CIA member geospatial intelligence as we talked
[01:29:34.180 --> 01:29:40.540]  about with Jade Helm situation is the most is the fastest growing branch of
[01:29:40.540 --> 01:29:45.660]  intelligence that our government has in order to watch us it is an essential part
[01:29:45.660 --> 01:29:47.740]  of that we're gonna talk about that when we come back we're gonna talk about
[01:29:47.740 --> 01:29:54.180]  activity-based intelligence on the march the empires on the run Alex Jones and
[01:29:54.180 --> 01:30:02.940]  the GCN radio network the Chinese president has ordered the People's
[01:30:02.940 --> 01:30:08.900]  Liberation Army to prepare for combat as a measure against possible hostile US
[01:30:08.900 --> 01:30:14.220]  action in the South China Sea after an international tribunal ruled that Beijing
[01:30:14.220 --> 01:30:19.460]  had no exclusive control over the area the permanent court of arbitration said
[01:30:19.460 --> 01:30:23.660]  that there was no evidence that China had historically exercised exclusive
[01:30:23.660 --> 01:30:28.940]  control over the waters or resources reports the BBC China responded by
[01:30:28.940 --> 01:30:33.980]  labeling the ruling ill-founded and refused to be bound by it however behind
[01:30:33.980 --> 01:30:38.660]  the scenes the Chinese president fears that the US could seize on the ruling to
[01:30:38.660 --> 01:30:43.980]  justify aggressive military maneuvers in the area and has ordered PLA forces to
[01:30:43.980 --> 01:30:48.780]  prepare for war China's Navy has repeatedly issued warnings to US
[01:30:48.780 --> 01:30:53.740]  surveillance planes flying over the region you can find more reports on
[01:30:53.740 --> 01:30:57.540]  info wars.com
[01:30:59.020 --> 01:31:02.900]  not a group you develop living defense for us it took you over a year to do it
[01:31:02.900 --> 01:31:07.340]  why is this so good because people are actually waking up to the problem that
[01:31:07.340 --> 01:31:12.660]  pretty much scares me the most I mean I try to make sure that I don't put toxins
[01:31:12.660 --> 01:31:16.860]  from food and water and beverages in my system but right now we're dealing with
[01:31:16.860 --> 01:31:21.780]  massive parasites which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives

[01:33:20.020 --> 01:33:23.260]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show on David Knight and we were just talking
[01:33:23.260 --> 01:33:28.300]  about Pokemon go we're just getting to what I think is really the important
[01:33:28.300 --> 01:33:33.620]  point about this and that is its access to our privacy and what that really means
[01:33:33.620 --> 01:33:38.500]  for us and we had this article from Kit Daniels yesterday Pokemon go was is
[01:33:38.500 --> 01:33:43.900]  linked to the CIA and he points out the developer of Pokemon go Niantic Inc. was
[01:33:43.900 --> 01:33:48.340]  founded by John Hink who provided previously received funding from the
[01:33:48.340 --> 01:33:53.220]  CIA's venture capital firm Incutel to develop what eventually became Google
[01:33:53.220 --> 01:33:57.500]  Earth Incutel was once described as an independent strategic investment firm
[01:33:57.500 --> 01:34:02.100]  that identifies innovative technology solutions to support the missions of the
[01:34:02.100 --> 01:34:07.860]  US intelligence community you understand what fascism is fascism it's not
[01:34:07.860 --> 01:34:11.740]  only just authoritarianism because you know we can have authoritarianism under
[01:34:11.740 --> 01:34:17.060]  socialism but it's also where the government controls private corporations
[01:34:17.060 --> 01:34:23.340]  I mean why is the CIA getting rich off of this technology and of course that's
[01:34:23.340 --> 01:34:27.860]  really what's happening I mean we see these guys work for the CIA for decades
[01:34:27.860 --> 01:34:33.340]  and they come out and somehow all of a sudden they get hooked up with a sweet
[01:34:33.340 --> 01:34:37.180]  heart deal in the world business and become overnight billionaires you've
[01:34:37.180 --> 01:34:41.500]  seen that over and over again so yeah they manipulate markets they manipulate
[01:34:41.500 --> 01:34:46.620]  companies they invest in companies but it also as he points out it turns your
[01:34:46.620 --> 01:34:51.780]  smartphones into essentially an imperial probe droid okay takes real-time
[01:34:51.780 --> 01:34:56.820]  ground-level footage of where you are and monitors where you are now we've
[01:34:56.820 --> 01:34:59.340]  talked about this before we talked about it when we were looking at Jade
[01:34:59.340 --> 01:35:04.140]  Helm member Jade Helm was mastering the human domain that was the tagline on
[01:35:04.140 --> 01:35:11.260]  Jade Helm human domain analytics is essentially looking at your activity
[01:35:11.260 --> 01:35:14.460]  based intelligence that's another part of geospatial intelligence this is the
[01:35:14.460 --> 01:35:19.940]  fastest growing division of the intelligence state geospatial
[01:35:19.940 --> 01:35:25.620]  intelligence where are you where are you understand that when you play Pokemon
[01:35:25.620 --> 01:35:31.540]  Go you open up all of your privacy application you know settings to that
[01:35:31.540 --> 01:35:35.700]  particular application so it knows everything about where you are we're
[01:35:35.700 --> 01:35:39.740]  told over and over again don't worry the NSA isn't listening to your phone
[01:35:39.740 --> 01:35:44.740]  conversations and transcribing them or collecting your text messages well that
[01:35:44.740 --> 01:35:49.420]  may or may not be true they say we're just looking at your metadata your
[01:35:49.420 --> 01:35:55.220]  metadata is the most important issue we've had William Benny former technical
[01:35:55.220 --> 01:36:00.140]  head of the NSA point that out to us but look at the geospatial intelligence
[01:36:00.140 --> 01:36:04.460]  community look at where James Clapper has essentially hung out for the last
[01:36:04.460 --> 01:36:10.980]  15 years they want to know what you're doing that's activity-based intelligence
[01:36:10.980 --> 01:36:16.580]  this is a perfect example of it and they want to take that and map it that's
[01:36:16.580 --> 01:36:21.860]  what human domain analytics is they want to map where you are where you go who
[01:36:21.860 --> 01:36:26.500]  you know what your political beliefs are what your religious beliefs are they
[01:36:26.500 --> 01:36:32.660]  want to get a full profile of you it's all about pre-crime analysis they want
[01:36:32.660 --> 01:36:36.420]  to identify who criminals are who terrorists are before they even do
[01:36:36.420 --> 01:36:42.180]  anything minority report style okay understand that so when we look at that
[01:36:42.180 --> 01:36:48.180]  we need to understand the potential for abuse and we need to understand that the
[01:36:48.180 --> 01:36:52.780]  connections to the people who are constantly abusing our civil liberties
[01:36:52.780 --> 01:36:57.260]  the CIA and as he points out further in the article like it says in the early
[01:36:57.260 --> 01:37:02.060]  2000s Incutel invested in Keyhole incorporated the company was founded by
[01:37:02.060 --> 01:37:07.460]  the same developer who developed 3d fly-by images of buildings and terrain
[01:37:07.460 --> 01:37:12.420]  from geospatial data collected by satellites they named Keyhole was an
[01:37:12.420 --> 01:37:17.300]  homage to the KH spy satellites first launched by the American National
[01:37:17.300 --> 01:37:22.380]  Reconnaissance Office this is all tied together folks you know we look at Jade
[01:37:22.380 --> 01:37:28.140]  Helm and the issues involved in that the fact that it was put out there for
[01:37:28.140 --> 01:37:33.300]  people we'd had multiple drills that were very high-profile surprise drills
[01:37:33.300 --> 01:37:38.740]  throughout the country from coast to coast in cities and then we see that
[01:37:38.740 --> 01:37:42.980]  there's this massive multi-state drill with all these different intelligence
[01:37:42.980 --> 01:37:46.580]  services and so we talked about that and nobody ever saw anything when that
[01:37:46.580 --> 01:37:50.660]  happened so what did they do they pull back we had a couple of communities where
[01:37:50.660 --> 01:37:54.700]  the sheriff said we don't want that happening here because we've seen what
[01:37:54.700 --> 01:37:58.540]  these drills have looked like in the past so maybe they scaled it back or
[01:37:58.540 --> 01:38:03.020]  shut it down altogether or maybe they did it in the dead of night did it
[01:38:03.020 --> 01:38:06.820]  secretly because that's really what the whole purpose of it was was to avoid
[01:38:06.820 --> 01:38:11.020]  detection so maybe they did it we didn't see them or maybe the whole thing was
[01:38:11.020 --> 01:38:16.540]  put out there as an effort to see who was going to oppose them to map that
[01:38:16.540 --> 01:38:21.820]  under their human domain analytics you have to understand that this is where
[01:38:21.820 --> 01:38:24.900]  our government is headed as I look at this article from Wired Magazine
[01:38:24.900 --> 01:38:28.340]  artificial intelligence is setting up the internet for a huge clash with Europe
[01:38:28.340 --> 01:38:34.180]  they're talking about neural networks now this is a particular type of of a
[01:38:34.180 --> 01:38:41.500]  network where they essentially model the human brain with a network of they
[01:38:41.500 --> 01:38:44.980]  they modeled the neurons that are inside the human brain in this computer
[01:38:44.980 --> 01:38:49.860]  network okay that gives them the ability to learn and they point out in Wired
[01:38:49.860 --> 01:38:54.340]  Magazine they these computer neural networks have learned to recognize faces
[01:38:54.340 --> 01:38:58.180]  and photos to identify spoken commands to translate text from one language to
[01:38:58.180 --> 01:39:03.660]  another they're helping to choose what you see when you query Google or where
[01:39:03.660 --> 01:39:08.900]  you visit Facebook news see that's how they manipulate what you see that's a
[01:39:08.900 --> 01:39:14.180]  key part of human domain analytics one of the things that they want to do is to
[01:39:14.180 --> 01:39:19.460]  see if their propaganda if their control is working I mean at this point that's
[01:39:19.460 --> 01:39:23.540]  a key part of what they're doing they put this stuff out there they try to
[01:39:23.540 --> 01:39:28.020]  control what you see by controlling your Google searches by controlling your
[01:39:28.020 --> 01:39:33.740]  Facebook news feed and then they monitor to see how public opinion is
[01:39:33.740 --> 01:39:37.820]  being affected are they having an effect are they winning the information war are
[01:39:37.820 --> 01:39:43.860]  they controlling your mind that's why they do this and then they're pointing
[01:39:43.860 --> 01:39:47.780]  out that it means that they're going to come into a clash with the European
[01:39:47.780 --> 01:39:52.540]  Union because European Union has put in a law they call it the right to be
[01:39:52.540 --> 01:39:56.420]  forgotten and we've talked about this before that would essentially bar private
[01:39:56.420 --> 01:40:00.620]  companies from retaining some of this information understand though that the
[01:40:00.620 --> 01:40:05.860]  governments are not going to forget anything the governments are not going
[01:40:05.860 --> 01:40:09.380]  to flush anything down the memory hole they may come up with draconian fines
[01:40:09.380 --> 01:40:12.700]  for private companies to make them flush stuff down the memory hole but
[01:40:12.700 --> 01:40:16.580]  they're not going to forget a single thing that you say or do on the internet
[01:40:16.580 --> 01:40:22.380]  they're going to store that and you need to understand that at the very least
[01:40:22.380 --> 01:40:26.060]  however even though I don't think this is going to be very effective to protect
[01:40:26.060 --> 01:40:31.180]  privacy when I look at these this conflict that Wired Magazine is talking
[01:40:31.180 --> 01:40:35.780]  about think about the fact that at least in Europe they understand the
[01:40:35.780 --> 01:40:39.420]  importance of privacy we don't even understand the importance of privacy in
[01:40:39.420 --> 01:40:45.500]  America anymore the Fourth Amendment is not only dead but the principles behind
[01:40:45.500 --> 01:40:52.140]  it are not even respected or valued in America anymore you know we had people
[01:40:52.140 --> 01:40:57.660]  who had written that because why they had soldiers who are quartered in their
[01:40:57.660 --> 01:41:01.660]  homes they had soldiers who would show up and rifle through their personal
[01:41:01.660 --> 01:41:05.260]  belongings and so they put in protections and said you're not going to do
[01:41:05.260 --> 01:41:07.980]  that without a search warrant and that search warrant is going to say it's going
[01:41:07.980 --> 01:41:11.900]  to be very specific about what you're looking for where you're looking for it
[01:41:11.900 --> 01:41:18.580]  who you're looking at and why and now we have ignored all of that we said we
[01:41:18.580 --> 01:41:22.100]  don't really care about our privacy and our personal effects or in our person
[01:41:22.100 --> 01:41:26.940]  you can put your hands on us you can stop us on the street and you can frisk
[01:41:26.940 --> 01:41:31.340]  and search us you can make it a condition for us to travel on airplanes and
[01:41:31.340 --> 01:41:37.420]  soon on other devices because we value only safety in this country we don't
[01:41:37.420 --> 01:41:44.380]  value anything else we don't understand the potential for danger that an all
[01:41:44.380 --> 01:41:49.660]  powerful all seeing total information awareness state presents to us that's
[01:41:49.660 --> 01:41:55.740]  the real key and when I watch people and we look at this and and I see Americans
[01:41:55.740 --> 01:42:00.340]  being turned into Pokemon jigglypuffs or as we would have said back in my
[01:42:00.340 --> 01:42:05.500]  generation when we read books Eloi you know those little pink things that were
[01:42:05.500 --> 01:42:08.980]  part of HD Wells time machine he goes in the future and he's got all these
[01:42:08.980 --> 01:42:14.540]  little pink giggly things called Eloi and then there's the dark morlocks that
[01:42:14.540 --> 01:42:20.100]  they come out from underground and some of these Eloi disappear first he
[01:42:20.100 --> 01:42:22.780]  thinks that the Eloi are the ones who are in charge so you think you're in
[01:42:22.780 --> 01:42:28.180]  charge don't you but you got to realize that it's this dark underground
[01:42:28.180 --> 01:42:33.820]  government the morlocks that are really playing you you're nothing but their
[01:42:33.820 --> 01:42:38.580]  cattle and they're tracking you everywhere you go when I look at what's
[01:42:38.580 --> 01:42:41.540]  happening and of course one of these reports about Pokemon go they were
[01:42:41.540 --> 01:42:46.220]  talking about how I just saw an accident happen because a guy was trying to collect
[01:42:46.220 --> 01:42:51.540]  some Pokemon figures and his augmented reality search okay doesn't that sound
[01:42:51.540 --> 01:42:56.820]  like what's going on with our self-crashing cars see Tesla has taken an
[01:42:56.820 --> 01:43:01.420]  approach where they give you the steering wheel and they're going to augment
[01:43:01.420 --> 01:43:06.300]  the driving experience for you just like Pokemon go does with augmented
[01:43:06.300 --> 01:43:12.060]  reality okay Google is going to give you a full virtual reality experience
[01:43:12.060 --> 01:43:15.060]  they're going to take away your steering wheel they're going to take away your
[01:43:15.060 --> 01:43:20.860]  brakes okay but Tesla is giving you an augmented reality and we just saw the
[01:43:20.860 --> 01:43:26.780]  third accident in just a couple of months involving autopilot or reports of
[01:43:26.780 --> 01:43:31.580]  autopilot that Tesla is claiming that autopilot was not involved in some of
[01:43:31.580 --> 01:43:34.700]  these crashes but they're being very vague about it they're they're always
[01:43:34.700 --> 01:43:40.900]  going to understand they're always going to blame the human operator as being an
[01:43:40.900 --> 01:43:43.980]  error it's never going to be their software it's never going to be their
[01:43:43.980 --> 01:43:49.180]  car it's always going to be you you're going to be the one who is to blame part
[01:43:49.180 --> 01:43:53.780]  of it is a design problem this latest crash that happened and this was out
[01:43:53.780 --> 01:43:59.500]  this was over the weekend and this was in Montana a driver let's call it a
[01:43:59.500 --> 01:44:04.860]  driver okay a jigglypuff who was along for the ride and his other passenger
[01:44:04.860 --> 01:44:09.540]  were driving in Montana they were going in an area that was about 55 to 60 miles
[01:44:09.540 --> 01:44:16.660]  an hour and then there was no centered line now at that point Tesla's so-called
[01:44:16.660 --> 01:44:21.940]  autopilot cuts off and it hands over control to you but how does it hand over
[01:44:21.940 --> 01:44:27.340]  control to you does it just quit do you are you when you're setting there playing
[01:44:27.340 --> 01:44:31.780]  Pokemon go or watching a Harry Potter movie or whatever you're doing at the
[01:44:31.780 --> 01:44:36.300]  time tweeting are you going to wake up quickly enough to take back control
[01:44:36.300 --> 01:44:41.020]  because it just stops driving just goes to sleep okay so what happened in this
[01:44:41.020 --> 01:44:45.420]  particular one says the vehicle appears to be totaled with the front passenger
[01:44:45.420 --> 01:44:48.160]  side being completely torn off including the wheel but fortunately both
[01:44:48.160 --> 01:44:54.020]  occupants are reportedly okay and so what they're saying is Tesla does not
[01:44:54.020 --> 01:44:57.860]  recommend to use the auto steer feature of autopilot on a road without a
[01:44:57.860 --> 01:45:01.980]  center divider and since the release of the 7.1 software update it limits the
[01:45:01.980 --> 01:45:05.780]  speed of the system to the speed limit of the road plus an additional five
[01:45:05.780 --> 01:45:10.180]  miles an hour so it knows a speed limit it's going to be following you with that
[01:45:10.180 --> 01:45:16.060]  it's going to be issuing you fines that's what's going to happen as our
[01:45:16.060 --> 01:45:20.860]  government tracks everywhere we go just like where the little Pokemon go people
[01:45:20.860 --> 01:45:26.940]  okay this is yeah Tesla autopilot for dummy I talked to Eric Peters yesterday
[01:45:26.940 --> 01:45:30.340]  as a he's an automotive rider an independent automotive rider very
[01:45:30.340 --> 01:45:33.580]  perceptive about what is going on he talks about it from a libertarian
[01:45:33.580 --> 01:45:36.740]  perspective one things he talked about with autopilot hat is how this is not
[01:45:36.740 --> 01:45:42.860]  really autopilot this is really in his words a Jetson vision of the future that's
[01:45:42.860 --> 01:45:47.740]  being sold to us it's truly false remember back in the 1950s I just was
[01:45:47.740 --> 01:45:52.220]  looking at a car magazine yesterday when I had all these pictures of 1950s
[01:45:52.220 --> 01:45:58.700]  automobiles with their fins and they had the whole fleet of these cars parked
[01:45:58.700 --> 01:46:05.780]  next to a 1950s jet just in case you missed the analogy okay and that's what
[01:46:05.780 --> 01:46:09.900]  they're trying to sell us by calling this autopilot but understand that true
[01:46:09.900 --> 01:46:15.180]  autopilot when that happens your flight plan is pre-programmed they make sure
[01:46:15.180 --> 01:46:20.740]  that there are no other planes anywhere close to you you can't do that in a real
[01:46:20.740 --> 01:46:25.180]  world and so what's going to happen is they're not going to space out your car
[01:46:25.180 --> 01:46:30.260]  miles and miles away from every other car and remove every possible object from
[01:46:30.260 --> 01:46:32.460]  you know what they're going to do is they're going to make sure that there
[01:46:32.460 --> 01:46:37.020]  are no humans that can get in your way of course that doesn't mean that there's
[01:46:37.020 --> 01:46:39.940]  not going to be other things that there's not going to be humans driving cars
[01:46:39.940 --> 01:46:42.860]  that doesn't mean that there's not going to be other things that are going to get
[01:46:42.860 --> 01:46:46.380]  in the way and are going to there you go there's the the 1950s everybody wanted
[01:46:46.380 --> 01:46:50.820]  their cars to look like a rocket ship and now they want to imagine that their
[01:46:50.820 --> 01:46:55.980]  cars are really planes again now that's where we're going understand as he
[01:46:55.980 --> 01:46:58.540]  pointed out that what you're going to do is you're going to give up your right
[01:46:58.540 --> 01:47:03.660]  to drive forever you're going to give up your freedom to drive forever and
[01:47:03.660 --> 01:47:10.740]  understand that it is a partnership between the people in Silicon Valley
[01:47:10.740 --> 01:47:16.060]  who are selling you this illusion and the government that wants to control and
[01:47:16.060 --> 01:47:21.940]  track everything you do and Uber that wants to control that wants to own all
[01:47:21.940 --> 01:47:25.780]  the cars you're not going to own anything it's going to be too expensive for you to
[01:47:25.780 --> 01:47:29.620]  buy these cars that are hyped up with all this technology simply isn't going to
[01:47:29.620 --> 01:47:33.980]  happen and I think most interesting thing that's coming out of all this is the
[01:47:33.980 --> 01:47:38.660]  crony capitalism we talked about that in our report as well the fact that there's
[01:47:38.660 --> 01:47:43.100]  been a lot of articles by various sources the LA Times has talked about how
[01:47:43.100 --> 01:47:49.260]  Elon Musk has gotten about five billion dollars in government subsidies for his
[01:47:49.260 --> 01:47:54.460]  various ventures that he's got going on of course SpaceX is one of those and
[01:47:54.460 --> 01:47:57.940]  he's gotten essentially a monopoly on launching space satellites and that was
[01:47:57.940 --> 01:48:02.060]  very easy to come by made some campaign contributions to John McCain and others
[01:48:02.060 --> 01:48:06.180]  to the right grease the right palms and he got where he wanted to go they've
[01:48:06.180 --> 01:48:11.700]  had nothing but encouragement and support from the Department of
[01:48:11.700 --> 01:48:14.820]  Transportation the Federal Department of Transportation as well as the National
[01:48:14.820 --> 01:48:20.300]  Highway Traffic Safety Administration I'll call them NHTSA for short they have
[01:48:20.300 --> 01:48:24.940]  essentially greased the skids for these people yet now we see the SEC is
[01:48:24.940 --> 01:48:29.780]  investigating Tesla and it's interesting I think because when you look at what
[01:48:29.780 --> 01:48:33.940]  happens and I guess Elon Musk is scratching his head and calling a
[01:48:33.940 --> 01:48:37.940]  meeting and saying wait a minute who was supposed to pay off these guys because
[01:48:37.940 --> 01:48:40.580]  what we're seeing happening with the Department of Transportation with NHTSA
[01:48:40.580 --> 01:48:44.940]  is essentially regulatory capture folks it's the same thing big pharma big
[01:48:44.940 --> 01:48:50.020]  agro do to the FDA they make sure that their regulators really aren't going to
[01:48:50.020 --> 01:48:54.660]  regulate them they look at it more as a partnership okay so that's what we're
[01:48:54.660 --> 01:48:58.500]  seeing out of the transportation bureaucracies but the Security and
[01:48:58.500 --> 01:49:01.820]  Exchange Commission is taking a look at this and says well wait a minute you had
[01:49:01.820 --> 01:49:08.780]  this accident on May 7th and it was 54 days before this was made public and in
[01:49:08.780 --> 01:49:13.620]  the meantime there was a lot of stock activity that was going on okay so there
[01:49:13.620 --> 01:49:18.540]  was this accident May 7th where the former Navy Seal was lulled to sleep
[01:49:18.540 --> 01:49:24.780]  and to his death by the promise of a safe autopilot car that was not reported
[01:49:24.780 --> 01:49:33.460]  to NHTSA for nine days and then NHTSA and Tesla both set on this information for
[01:49:33.460 --> 01:49:41.180]  another 43 days meanwhile Goldman Sachs upgraded their stock to a buy Tesla
[01:49:41.180 --> 01:49:46.580]  sold about one and a half billion dollars worth of stock they use that to buy to
[01:49:46.580 --> 01:49:51.740]  make an offer of three billion dollars to acquire a rooftop solar installer and
[01:49:51.740 --> 01:49:58.100]  so forth and so on and then finally on June 30th 54 days after the accident
[01:49:58.100 --> 01:50:02.780]  NHTSA goes public with the idea with the information that Tesla had had a crash
[01:50:02.780 --> 01:50:09.500]  and that's the way they have rolled out this timeline and so now the SEC is
[01:50:09.500 --> 01:50:13.820]  saying well we want to take a look at this and see if you should have disclosed
[01:50:13.820 --> 01:50:18.020]  this to investors when you're making all this money off of the stock market but
[01:50:18.020 --> 01:50:22.140]  what we're going to see is we're going to see the same thing happen with Tesla
[01:50:22.140 --> 01:50:27.340]  that we saw happen with Hillary Clinton it's going to be one standard for
[01:50:27.340 --> 01:50:31.700]  everybody else and a different standard for the people who are well connected
[01:50:31.700 --> 01:50:37.580]  that's what we constantly see you need to understand that the way the rules of
[01:50:37.580 --> 01:50:43.180]  the road are set up it's a they take everybody off the road when they come
[01:50:43.180 --> 01:50:46.220]  to town with the president don't they they shut down the airports they shut
[01:50:46.220 --> 01:50:50.020]  down the highways and they grease the skids for these people and that's what
[01:50:50.020 --> 01:50:54.660]  we're seeing with these crony capitalists stay with us we'll be right back
[01:50:59.460 --> 01:51:05.420]  in a crisis your number one need is food but not just any food experts say
[01:51:05.420 --> 01:51:09.780]  everyone needs to have non-perishable good for 25 years survival food on hand

[01:54:20.540 --> 01:54:26.360]  Tesla in the last two months but also the killer robots that have now we've
[01:54:26.360 --> 01:54:31.780]  seen used for the first time here in America in the shooting in Dallas there's
[01:54:31.780 --> 01:54:35.060]  some ethical issues behind that I want to talk about but before we do just want

[01:55:18.940 --> 01:55:23.260]  something that Alex's dad is a dentist he's been practicing for 30 years he
[01:55:23.260 --> 01:55:27.780]  said it's the best teeth whitening system that he is seen he uses it in his
[01:55:27.780 --> 01:55:34.300]  practice it is essentially three aspects it's a sonic a ghost smile sonic
[01:55:34.300 --> 01:55:39.220]  toothbrush that vibrates at an average of 27,000 times per minute to give you a
[01:55:39.220 --> 01:55:44.780]  super deep clean it also has a whitening gel and a blue wavelength light
[01:55:44.780 --> 01:55:47.620]  technology it's part of that brush there that kills bacteria in your mouth
[01:55:47.620 --> 01:55:52.060]  that causes bad breath and activates the whitening gel so it's a three-in-one
[01:55:52.060 --> 01:55:57.420]  system it's something I think is looks very promising I'm gonna try it myself
[01:55:57.420 --> 01:56:03.140]  and I've got a vibrating toothbrush but I don't have anything like that gel that
[01:56:03.140 --> 01:56:06.420]  whitens teeth and kills bacteria so something I'm going to pick up right
[01:56:06.420 --> 01:56:12.220]  now for limited time as a new product we've got 25% off your second toothbrush

[01:56:26.780 --> 01:56:33.620]  it's something that that Alex's dad who's been a dentist for 30 years has
[01:56:33.620 --> 01:56:38.180]  put together something that I think you'll find very useful now as we're
[01:56:38.180 --> 01:56:44.220]  looking at killer robots and we saw the first one used this last week as part of
[01:56:44.220 --> 01:56:49.100]  the shooting we had a lot of people come out and say well okay we're not going to
[01:56:49.100 --> 01:56:54.860]  put any more lives in danger we got a guy who is crazy he's shooting people
[01:56:54.860 --> 01:56:57.700]  without reason he's targeting people because they're white because they're
[01:56:57.700 --> 01:57:04.660]  police so we're not going to expose anybody else to the beginning shot okay
[01:57:04.660 --> 01:57:09.740]  fine we understand that but also understand that earlier in the day we
[01:57:09.740 --> 01:57:14.580]  had a guy who was simply exercising his right under Texas law to do open carry
[01:57:14.580 --> 01:57:19.700]  and he was wrongly accused of being one of the shooters and that's another part
[01:57:19.700 --> 01:57:24.820]  of this okay if you want to know what's going on one of the things that that
[01:57:24.820 --> 01:57:28.660]  concerns me about this is the fact that we were told as it was happening that
[01:57:28.660 --> 01:57:32.820]  they were getting triangulated that they had shots coming in from multiple
[01:57:32.820 --> 01:57:36.940]  directions that they believe there are multiple shooters and now we're told as
[01:57:36.940 --> 01:57:42.220]  always that it's a lone shooter you know when I look at these situations when I
[01:57:42.220 --> 01:57:48.300]  look at these mass murders I want to know that we got everybody don't you don't
[01:57:48.300 --> 01:57:51.740]  you want to know that we got the right person that we got everybody don't you
[01:57:51.740 --> 01:57:57.740]  want to know that we followed due process instead of having a kind of judge
[01:57:57.740 --> 01:58:02.900]  dread process where we allow our police to be judge juries and executioners
[01:58:02.900 --> 01:58:07.420]  where they say I am the law and they just execute people on the street
[01:58:07.420 --> 01:58:14.020]  understand what happened with Mark Hughes okay he was identified by the
[01:58:14.020 --> 01:58:18.300]  police his picture went out on social media he said I just got out of
[01:58:18.300 --> 01:58:21.580]  interrogation room when he talked to CBS just hours after shooting he says I
[01:58:21.580 --> 01:58:26.020]  was there for 30 minutes of the police officers lying saying they had video of
[01:58:26.020 --> 01:58:29.380]  me shooting he said that's a lie they said they have a witness saying I shot
[01:58:29.380 --> 01:58:33.220]  a gun that's a lie I mean at the end of the day the system is trying to get me
[01:58:33.220 --> 01:58:38.180]  and we look at this we have to question whether or not we want to allow this
[01:58:38.180 --> 01:58:40.580]  precedent to continue we'll talk more about this on the other side of the
[01:58:40.580 --> 01:58:48.460]  break stay with us this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network
[01:58:48.460 --> 01:58:53.500]  hey everyone pharmacist Ben Fuchs here host of the Bright Side and as many of

[01:59:49.820 --> 02:00:16.380]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:00:16.380 --> 02:00:22.020]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night i'm gonna be joined in the
[02:00:22.020 --> 02:00:26.700]  next segment by both alex jones and then if a good good shawty is going to join
[02:00:26.700 --> 02:00:32.460]  us in the studio talk about the collapse of society one evidence of the
[02:00:32.460 --> 02:00:36.180]  collapse of society i think is the fact that everybody seems to be just fine
[02:00:36.180 --> 02:00:41.220]  with the fact that the police used a robot to kill the shooter is what we
[02:00:41.220 --> 02:00:46.860]  have here look let's understand this folks this truly is the first use of a
[02:00:46.860 --> 02:00:54.740]  drone to kill an american on american soil without any due process now we can
[02:00:54.740 --> 02:00:59.500]  argue that it was done to save lives okay but you have to understand that there
[02:00:59.500 --> 02:01:05.260]  is nothing more dangerous than a government that is not held to a legal
[02:01:05.260 --> 02:01:09.940]  standard in the long run you're going to lose a lot more lives that way this is
[02:01:09.940 --> 02:01:12.660]  the story that was up from the ron paul institute on info wars yesterday and
[02:01:12.660 --> 02:01:17.300]  dallas drone wars just came home and that was essentially the point they may
[02:01:17.300 --> 02:01:20.340]  they said yeah it was done with a drone even though it was wheels instead of
[02:01:20.340 --> 02:01:23.940]  wings on this particular drone and as i was talking about before we went to the
[02:01:23.940 --> 02:01:29.100]  break the shooter who was falsely i'm sorry the open carry person who was
[02:01:29.100 --> 02:01:34.500]  falsely identified as a shooter and that was a black dallas protester mark
[02:01:34.500 --> 02:01:40.100]  hughes went out all over social media the police said they had they they held
[02:01:40.100 --> 02:01:42.900]  him for questioning for a half hour so we've got pictures of you shooting a
[02:01:42.900 --> 02:01:46.300]  gun he said they're they're lying about me and eventually they turned him loose
[02:01:46.300 --> 02:01:50.260]  they were just calling the bluff but you have to ask yourself how far down the
[02:01:50.260 --> 02:01:54.340]  road are we going to go when the police are being attacked like this or there's
[02:01:54.340 --> 02:02:01.380]  an urgent need that they will out of fear or expediency just shoot someone
[02:02:01.380 --> 02:02:04.820]  instead of putting their picture out on social media and saying this is the
[02:02:04.820 --> 02:02:09.300]  shooter well they not just kill a future mark hughes that's the point that's made
[02:02:09.300 --> 02:02:12.180]  in the article so during the questioning they told hughes they had a video of
[02:02:12.180 --> 02:02:15.460]  them shooting people that was a lie what if the police had sent a drone to take
[02:02:15.460 --> 02:02:19.860]  him out what will happen in the future the future mark hughes who are falsely
[02:02:19.860 --> 02:02:25.140]  accused by the police of being in a shooting will we come to accept murder
[02:02:25.140 --> 02:02:30.180]  without a trial so part of the problem with this is when we look at all these
[02:02:30.180 --> 02:02:35.820]  mass shootings they're always used to further a political agenda wouldn't we
[02:02:35.820 --> 02:02:39.180]  like to know that we truly have gotten to the bottom of it that we truly have
[02:02:39.180 --> 02:02:43.980]  gotten the people that were involved in it that we have an accurate picture of
[02:02:43.980 --> 02:02:49.540]  what happened but understand that this really isn't about race fundamentally
[02:02:49.540 --> 02:02:54.540]  this is about an arms race this is about the military industrial complex
[02:02:54.540 --> 02:02:59.700]  coming home to America they want the militarized police because it's going to
[02:02:59.700 --> 02:03:04.660]  be a profit center for them the war on terror is a profit center that was the
[02:03:04.660 --> 02:03:07.820]  key profit center they had as they shut down the cold war course they started the
[02:03:07.820 --> 02:03:11.860]  cold war up again as well they're going to be building all those long range
[02:03:11.860 --> 02:03:16.500]  bombers and missiles again that's what all this activity in the Ukraine is
[02:03:16.500 --> 02:03:22.620]  about another profit center for that but they do want that profit center of the
[02:03:22.620 --> 02:03:27.900]  war on terror people who say that we're concerned and we are concerned that we're
[02:03:27.900 --> 02:03:31.980]  going to have a militarized police you need to understand the police are already
[02:03:31.980 --> 02:03:36.620]  militarized we've already got the federal government training our police the
[02:03:36.620 --> 02:03:41.100]  question is is it going to increase we've had the federal government training
[02:03:41.100 --> 02:03:46.660]  the police and rules of engagement training them to essentially be like
[02:03:46.660 --> 02:03:51.700]  Barney Fife fearful of everything that they see flaunting their authority
[02:03:51.700 --> 02:03:55.420]  except instead of taking their bullets they give them a magazine full of
[02:03:55.420 --> 02:03:59.660]  bullets and tell them to once they start firing to continue to fire until the
[02:03:59.660 --> 02:04:05.020]  magazine is empty those are the rule of engagement that are coming from the
[02:04:05.020 --> 02:04:09.380]  federal police and they're giving militarized vehicles in the name of the
[02:04:09.380 --> 02:04:15.260]  war on drugs okay it truly is a war they brought a war to our streets war of
[02:04:15.260 --> 02:04:19.940]  terror is from them the war of drugs is from them it's not going to solve
[02:04:19.940 --> 02:04:24.060]  anything when we even had the Dallas police chief come out and say we've
[02:04:24.060 --> 02:04:29.220]  got to stop asking cops to do so much in this country he says every societal
[02:04:29.220 --> 02:04:32.660]  failure we put it on the cops to solve you talked about drug addiction all
[02:04:32.660 --> 02:04:36.020]  these other things no we put it on the government to solve we think the
[02:04:36.020 --> 02:04:39.660]  government should solve everything and we think the government should use force
[02:04:39.660 --> 02:04:44.540]  to solve everything to make us safe and so that's why we use the police to do
[02:04:44.540 --> 02:04:48.580]  it he's exactly right about that but then of course he goes on further and he
[02:04:48.580 --> 02:04:52.940]  says you can become part of the solution join the police force and we'll
[02:04:52.940 --> 02:04:57.500]  solve all of your problems now I'm from the government I'm here to help you is
[02:04:57.500 --> 02:05:02.780]  not true we'll be right back the Chinese president has ordered the People's
[02:05:02.780 --> 02:05:08.780]  Liberation Army to prepare for combat as a measure against possible hostile US
[02:05:08.780 --> 02:05:14.100]  action in the South China Sea after an international tribunal ruled that Beijing
[02:05:14.100 --> 02:05:19.340]  had no exclusive control over the area the permanent court of arbitration said
[02:05:19.340 --> 02:05:23.500]  that there was no evidence that China had historically exercised exclusive
[02:05:23.500 --> 02:05:28.780]  control over the waters or resources reports the BBC China responded by
[02:05:28.780 --> 02:05:33.860]  labeling the ruling ill-founded and refused to be bound by it however behind
[02:05:33.860 --> 02:05:38.500]  the scenes the Chinese president fears that the US could seize on the ruling to
[02:05:38.500 --> 02:05:43.820]  justify aggressive military maneuvers in the area and has ordered PLA forces to
[02:05:43.820 --> 02:05:48.620]  prepare for war China's Navy has repeatedly issued warnings to US
[02:05:48.620 --> 02:05:53.660]  surveillance planes flying over the region you can find more reports on

[02:07:11.660 --> 02:07:15.740]  how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding
[02:07:15.740 --> 02:07:19.940]  fluoride the bad member of the halogen family into the water they took the good
[02:07:19.940 --> 02:07:24.900]  halogen and put the deadly halogen in and when the Fukushima crisis worsened as

[02:08:20.380 --> 02:08:29.660]  studios it's Alex Jones. We have seen attacks on free speech to the United
[02:08:29.660 --> 02:08:34.260]  States in Europe in the last few years that are unprecedented in modern
[02:08:34.260 --> 02:08:39.540]  history only dictators like Hitler tried to do the things we're now
[02:08:39.540 --> 02:08:43.420]  witnessing if you criticize open borders and the Islamic invasion of
[02:08:43.420 --> 02:08:48.020]  Europe they arrest you Facebook bans you and now those same activities are
[02:08:48.020 --> 02:08:53.500]  starting here it's time to take the blinders off we have seen men waving
[02:08:53.500 --> 02:09:01.500]  Mexican flags beat up women in California on television and the mayor has
[02:09:01.500 --> 02:09:16.700]  come out in the town and said hey they deserved it we have seen attacks on
[02:09:16.700 --> 02:09:21.740]  free speech that are truly unprecedented and that are racially motivated I would
[02:09:21.740 --> 02:09:26.020]  be against a group of Caucasian men beating up a Hispanic woman just as much
[02:09:26.020 --> 02:09:33.540]  as I'm against a group of Hispanic men beating up an innocent white person or
[02:09:33.540 --> 02:09:37.780]  the KKK going after an innocent black person or vice versa I've seen black
[02:09:37.780 --> 02:09:42.500]  lives matter full of their vitriol and hate just beat up people in some cases
[02:09:42.500 --> 02:09:47.140]  folks that aren't even Trump supporters in their hatred in their built-up
[02:09:47.140 --> 02:09:51.340]  victimology of life that they've got something to prove and they have a right
[02:09:51.340 --> 02:09:54.700]  to be angry and have a chip on their shoulder and it's all being manipulated
[02:09:54.700 --> 02:10:02.740]  by the social engineers and I promise you if they go about they burn up of
[02:10:02.740 --> 02:10:08.060]  whatever they said you're doing you're pulling a bus that you put your
[02:10:08.060 --> 02:10:15.060]  pussy on you but that because at the end of the day it's gonna be you with your
[02:10:15.060 --> 02:10:20.060]  Panthers trust me when you see me move I'm moving in violence
[02:10:20.060 --> 02:10:23.260]  stop clubbing stop clubbing stop clubbing because most of y'all folks
[02:10:23.260 --> 02:10:26.060]  ain't involved real talk
[02:10:26.060 --> 02:10:30.060]  we're tired of walking around here asking y'all to help us
[02:10:30.060 --> 02:10:33.060]  we need action
[02:10:33.060 --> 02:10:45.900]  and now ahead of Cleveland next week we have seen riots all over the country
[02:10:45.900 --> 02:10:51.300]  police shot all over the nation every few hours it's happening at courthouses
[02:10:51.300 --> 02:10:57.020]  and highways from Michigan to Georgia from Tennessee to Texas and we see the
[02:10:57.020 --> 02:11:00.900]  White House and the Justice Department Loretta Lynch get out and say you better
[02:11:00.900 --> 02:11:05.420]  listen to black lives matter we've seen Hillary say better listen up I'm going
[02:11:05.420 --> 02:11:10.140]  to be talking to white people I think we're the ones who have to start
[02:11:10.140 --> 02:11:15.660]  listening to the legitimate cries that are coming from our African American
[02:11:15.660 --> 02:11:20.580]  fellow citizens this is a woman that overthrows countries and puts ISIS in
[02:11:20.580 --> 02:11:23.740]  charge to murder hundreds of thousands of Christians this is a woman that gets
[02:11:23.740 --> 02:11:28.140]  100 million dollars from Saudi Arabia and more from Gulf States where they
[02:11:28.140 --> 02:11:31.700]  totally enslave women these are the biggest damn hypocrites the world's
[02:11:31.700 --> 02:11:37.180]  ever seen you got a bunch of trendies that don't care about what's right they
[02:11:37.180 --> 02:11:40.700]  want to just say they're liberal and feel good about themselves and see a
[02:11:40.700 --> 02:11:45.940]  great agenda of evil foisted on the planet I'm going to Cleveland because
[02:11:45.940 --> 02:11:50.220]  of these bullets I've said for months I'm going and I'm going I'm gonna be there
[02:11:50.220 --> 02:11:54.460]  with rallies and live events standing up for free speech and standing up for
[02:11:54.460 --> 02:11:58.740]  what's left of this country the whole Republican establishment along the
[02:11:58.740 --> 02:12:02.300]  Democrats has been trying to block our rallies we've sued them twice they failed
[02:12:02.300 --> 02:12:05.460]  they've been trying to keep Trump from getting the nomination they have pulled
[02:12:05.460 --> 02:12:09.740]  out the stops with lies and disinformation because they want the prize
[02:12:09.740 --> 02:12:13.840]  that is America that they've already sold out they've already shipped our
[02:12:13.840 --> 02:12:18.100]  jobs to China they've already set up tariffs and systems that ensure we
[02:12:18.100 --> 02:12:22.540]  can't compete we're run by traders and they can't believe we're starting to
[02:12:22.540 --> 02:12:27.860]  wake up like folks did in the UK with the Brexit ladies and gentlemen this is
[02:12:27.860 --> 02:12:32.100]  history happening right now we're covering it right here in info wars and
[02:12:32.100 --> 02:12:37.660]  it's more important than ever that you realize history is happening and what
[02:12:37.660 --> 02:12:40.900]  develops here in the next few months is gonna change the course of history for
[02:12:40.900 --> 02:12:46.060]  good or for bad but I'm not gonna sit there and watch a bunch of brainwashed
[02:12:46.060 --> 02:12:52.660]  government funded George Soros supported thugs run around and attack men
[02:12:52.660 --> 02:12:58.300]  women and children in the hopes of intimidation a lot of people watch what
[02:12:58.300 --> 02:13:02.140]  different socialist groups are doing with Bernie Sanders groups are doing
[02:13:02.140 --> 02:13:06.780]  with Black Lives Matter doing they say that's crazy that just credits them it's
[02:13:06.780 --> 02:13:11.140]  horrible what they're doing and that's because you're from a perspective of
[02:13:11.140 --> 02:13:16.500]  support and free speech but for a lot of the young people in this country and a
[02:13:16.500 --> 02:13:21.220]  lot of the people raised by MTV they think anything's okay as long as you
[02:13:21.220 --> 02:13:26.740]  say you're liberal and they think it's cool to support wars torture islamic
[02:13:26.740 --> 02:13:33.860]  mutilization of women islamic you know just absolute sexual genocide they
[02:13:33.860 --> 02:13:38.820]  support all of it because it isn't about actually empowering humanity it's
[02:13:38.820 --> 02:13:42.700]  about them claiming they have the moral high ground in dominating and
[02:13:42.700 --> 02:13:48.460]  controlling language and culture and everything else it's time to get
[02:13:48.460 --> 02:13:52.660]  aggressive it's time to get in these people's faces it's time to not
[02:13:52.660 --> 02:13:57.340]  associate with people you've put up with over the years who claim they're
[02:13:57.340 --> 02:14:01.260]  liberal but then tell you you're bad because you're pro-second amendment I'm
[02:14:01.260 --> 02:14:04.420]  so sick of all these Hollywood people that make all these movies where they're
[02:14:04.420 --> 02:14:08.420]  badasses with guns and shoot all these folks they've got bodyguards in real
[02:14:08.420 --> 02:14:12.340]  life but they don't want us to own guns I'm gonna start more and more calling out
[02:14:12.340 --> 02:14:16.740]  all the so-called Hollywood badasses that are nothing but establishment horrors
[02:14:16.740 --> 02:14:20.260]  that want to disarm the people now I'm gonna start calling out other frauds as
[02:14:20.260 --> 02:14:24.780]  well and it's time for you to do it because they're part of a globalist
[02:14:24.780 --> 02:14:28.660]  takeover and they since they're with the power structure and they think by going
[02:14:28.660 --> 02:14:32.980]  along with it they somehow have power they don't realize they're useful idiots
[02:14:32.980 --> 02:14:39.260]  who'll be thrown to the side history shows that look if you want to deny this
[02:14:39.260 --> 02:14:42.020]  country's being strangled if you want to deny that the globalist are breaking
[02:14:42.020 --> 02:14:45.780]  this country's will and turning this against each other that's fine let
[02:14:45.780 --> 02:14:49.700]  your chain set lightly upon you as Patrick Henry said but as for me I want
[02:14:49.700 --> 02:14:53.100]  to know the whole truth and make preparations for it and as for me give
[02:14:53.100 --> 02:14:57.540]  me liberty or give me death because being a slave is worse than death now back
[02:14:57.540 --> 02:15:01.260]  to the live transmission David Knight Anthony Guggiardi and the rest of crew
[02:15:01.260 --> 02:15:06.100]  at Austin Texas Lord willing I'll be back to live tomorrow in studio for what
[02:15:06.100 --> 02:15:11.740]  we call the info war and that was Alex Jones and I'm David Knight here in
[02:15:11.740 --> 02:15:15.460]  studio with Anthony Guggiardi I want to get Anthony's take on what's happening
[02:15:15.460 --> 02:15:21.900]  now with the as we're brought to the brink of a race war as well as calls for
[02:15:21.900 --> 02:15:26.060]  further federal control and militarization of the police no Anthony is
[02:15:26.060 --> 02:15:31.020]  looking at the comments from the girlfriend of the guy who was shot
[02:15:31.020 --> 02:15:36.700]  Philando Castile she she filmed him as he was dying you know we can argue all
[02:15:36.700 --> 02:15:40.700]  these statistics about who is more victimized by this or white people or
[02:15:40.700 --> 02:15:43.940]  black people you know in terms of absolute numbers there's more white
[02:15:43.940 --> 02:15:47.140]  people killed but in terms of percentage so much higher percentage of black
[02:15:47.140 --> 02:15:51.260]  people who are killed so forth and so on Washington Post took my cockabit a
[02:15:51.260 --> 02:15:54.420]  task on that he came back to them he says well I guess you could say male
[02:15:54.420 --> 02:15:58.700]  lives matter because 94% of people who are killed are males so we could try to
[02:15:58.700 --> 02:16:03.700]  to divide it down by that but to me it's a much more fundamental problem because
[02:16:03.700 --> 02:16:07.100]  one of the things that she said was she said if we can't turn to our higher
[02:16:07.100 --> 02:16:11.660]  power you know officers and things of that sort then who are we going to turn
[02:16:11.660 --> 02:16:15.220]  to if the people that are supposed to be protecting us are the ones that are
[02:16:15.220 --> 02:16:19.540]  assassinating us and when I look at that it's like if you're going to just
[02:16:19.540 --> 02:16:22.420]  passively turn yourself over to a government and think that it's going to
[02:16:22.420 --> 02:16:26.980]  protect you you have to understand that if you lean on the government and use it
[02:16:26.980 --> 02:16:30.580]  as a crutch you're going to find out that it's a stick that's going to break and
[02:16:30.580 --> 02:16:33.500]  pierce your hand and I think that's what people are finding out but they haven't
[02:16:33.500 --> 02:16:37.580]  come to that conclusion they're still blaming it on race you know I think if
[02:16:37.580 --> 02:16:40.860]  we were a doctor if we were both doctors looking at the United States looking
[02:16:40.860 --> 02:16:45.260]  in America we were to make a diagnosis this is all just a symptom right a good
[02:16:45.260 --> 02:16:50.140]  doctor if you came in with let's say you know boils on your hands or hives on
[02:16:50.140 --> 02:16:53.180]  your face or something he wouldn't just say oh well that's hives he would say
[02:16:53.180 --> 02:16:56.500]  what's causing the hives what did you do what did you eat you know something
[02:16:56.500 --> 02:17:00.980]  something's going on there's an internal root issue this is just
[02:17:00.980 --> 02:17:07.140]  bald up anger and hatred and frustration and I've got a ton of articles printed
[02:17:07.140 --> 02:17:11.420]  out today about some of these statistics people are pissed off there's so much
[02:17:11.420 --> 02:17:14.860]  they're so angry they're just full of rage and hatred because the government
[02:17:14.860 --> 02:17:18.460]  has completely shut them out the establishment has completely screwed
[02:17:18.460 --> 02:17:22.460]  them they bought into the lie everybody not just black lives matter
[02:17:22.460 --> 02:17:27.460]  everybody everyone has at one point another society as all has bought into
[02:17:27.460 --> 02:17:31.300]  the slides bought into the system psychology today has a great article
[02:17:31.300 --> 02:17:36.220]  about is society manufacturing depressed and angry people I mean all of this is
[02:17:36.220 --> 02:17:41.420]  just a symptom of the fact that our society has been duped it has been but
[02:17:41.420 --> 02:17:44.580]  as you point out all the time we talk about health issues typically that's
[02:17:44.580 --> 02:17:48.060]  what we see the doctors doing is addressing this exactly so treating the
[02:17:48.060 --> 02:17:51.380]  outbreak rather than getting to the root cause of it well as above so below
[02:17:51.380 --> 02:17:55.140]  sometimes in a micro level we can see things that apply to a meta level right
[02:17:55.140 --> 02:17:59.740]  so this it stuck out to me today specifically these two articles side by
[02:17:59.740 --> 02:18:03.420]  side you have to you have to have some humor sometimes but think about this so
[02:18:03.420 --> 02:18:09.380]  one says what economic recovery 62% of Americans don't even have a thousand
[02:18:09.380 --> 02:18:15.260]  dollars in savings okay so think about the average person 62% don't even have a
[02:18:15.260 --> 02:18:18.900]  thousand dollars in savings but then that's next to this headline from CNN
[02:18:18.900 --> 02:18:24.740]  money stocks have never been higher it says the Dow is higher than it's ever
[02:18:24.740 --> 02:18:29.500]  been before and it's like a celebratory thing the Dow to recover from Brexit did
[02:18:29.500 --> 02:18:33.980]  it yes like the week of his back but the juxtaposition here is absurd the Dow
[02:18:33.980 --> 02:18:38.340]  gained over 120 points and hit 18,353 on Tuesday surpassing the previous
[02:18:38.340 --> 02:18:43.420]  record set in May 2015 and I you know the the economists are saying this is a
[02:18:43.420 --> 02:18:47.900]  the the the economies recovering it's rebounding this is so powerful having
[02:18:47.900 --> 02:18:52.220]  this economic rebound meanwhile 62% of Americans don't have a thousand dollars
[02:18:52.220 --> 02:18:55.980]  in savings so you can see now the disconnect just at this micro level
[02:18:55.980 --> 02:18:59.140]  right where there's people walking around 62% don't have a thousand dollars
[02:18:59.140 --> 02:19:03.540]  that's going to make them upset not to mention you know we can get into more of
[02:19:03.540 --> 02:19:07.100]  this too we come back from the break but Americans work more than anyone more
[02:19:07.100 --> 02:19:10.580]  than the English more than the French the Germans Norwegians they take less
[02:19:10.580 --> 02:19:14.500]  vacation work longer days make less money and now China's middle class is
[02:19:14.500 --> 02:19:19.100]  surpassing American middle class in savings it's you it's insane there's
[02:19:19.100 --> 02:19:22.340]  no way people are not gonna hit the boiling point it's like if you poured
[02:19:22.340 --> 02:19:27.140]  gasoline all over a house and there's just people walking by I mean for days
[02:19:27.140 --> 02:19:29.940]  and days watching the gasoline sit there someone's gonna throw a match on it and
[02:19:29.940 --> 02:19:35.460]  that's the mainstream media the the lens the focus is on things like you know
[02:19:35.460 --> 02:19:39.260]  the police and all this this is just a symptom of the root issue not that
[02:19:39.260 --> 02:19:41.580]  there's not real discrimination and real horrible things going on there
[02:19:41.580 --> 02:19:45.860]  certainly is but the media focuses that rage into something that's right and they
[02:19:45.860 --> 02:19:48.860]  use it to exacerbate the condition and as Gerald Salenty has always said when
[02:19:48.860 --> 02:19:52.940]  people lose everything they lose it and that's what we're about to see here we're
[02:19:52.940 --> 02:19:57.740]  gonna be right back I'm David Knight with Anthony Gucci already stay with us

[02:24:16.460 --> 02:24:20.300]  David Knight here with Anthony Gutierrez in the studio we're just talking about
[02:24:20.300 --> 02:24:25.900]  the two different Americas I guess you could say it's a meme that people have
[02:24:25.900 --> 02:24:31.020]  talked about the essence that the investor class has basically played
[02:24:31.020 --> 02:24:36.500]  things like the Brexit to make a great deal of money haven't they Anthony you
[02:24:36.500 --> 02:24:42.740]  know they thrive off of markets that go radically up and radically down and if
[02:24:42.740 --> 02:24:45.220]  they can come up with a rationale to make that happen that's when they make
[02:24:45.220 --> 02:24:47.660]  their money they don't make any money when everything goes sideways and they're
[02:24:47.660 --> 02:24:50.700]  making a lot of money off of this meanwhile as you point out in the last
[02:24:50.700 --> 02:24:55.660]  segment most Americans have what less than a thousand dollars though to tie
[02:24:55.660 --> 02:25:01.140]  them over so most people are not really prepared for the kinds of challenges
[02:25:01.140 --> 02:25:05.260]  that we're likely to face we're seeing things getting very volatile we've had
[02:25:05.260 --> 02:25:09.300]  people talking about a summer of chaos coming up it's about to begin this next
[02:25:09.300 --> 02:25:12.020]  week we've had a black lives matter another group saying they're going to
[02:25:12.020 --> 02:25:15.620]  shut down these two political conventions we're going to be there you can
[02:25:15.620 --> 02:25:20.060]  help to fuel our reports with the info war as well as to provide for your
[02:25:20.060 --> 02:25:23.900]  health with these specials that we've extended we've got 20% still off of
[02:25:23.900 --> 02:25:30.060]  survival shield x2 that's going to end tonight that's a nascent iodine also
[02:25:30.060 --> 02:25:35.140]  ending tonight is 20 to 40% off info war select storeable food that's a very key
[02:25:35.140 --> 02:25:39.540]  way to provide for yourself and your family and these times of uncertainty
[02:25:39.540 --> 02:25:44.620]  make sure that you're going to be protected not only against disruptions
[02:25:44.620 --> 02:25:49.220]  in the food supply but also against massive price increases that could also
[02:25:49.220 --> 02:25:54.420]  come through we've had reports that have come out and it was the food chain
[02:25:54.420 --> 02:25:57.020]  reaction was a simulation that they were running they were saying well what
[02:25:57.020 --> 02:26:01.380]  happens if we have this kind of input or that kind of input what happens to food
[02:26:01.380 --> 02:26:05.700]  prices and to the supply chain and of course the types of inputs that they
[02:26:05.700 --> 02:26:08.900]  were modeling in the reporter precisely the types of things that we see them
[02:26:08.900 --> 02:26:14.260]  doing now so you want to protect yourself against that kind of uncertainty and not
[02:26:14.260 --> 02:26:19.900]  being able to afford food make sure that you've got something set there that is
[02:26:19.900 --> 02:26:25.100]  a backup in case there is a shock to the food chain they called a food chain
[02:26:25.100 --> 02:26:29.860]  reaction they survived the simulation there we have 20 to 40% off info war
[02:26:29.860 --> 02:26:36.060]  select storeable food that is storeable for 25 years all made in America GMO free
[02:26:36.060 --> 02:26:39.740]  and so the best packaging you'll find and the best discount you're going to
[02:26:39.740 --> 02:26:43.260]  find anywhere and that's going to end tonight 20 to 40% off info war select
[02:26:43.260 --> 02:26:48.380]  storeable food as well as a 20% off survival shield x2 nascent iodine we
[02:26:48.380 --> 02:26:54.000]  have to end those sales tonight you'll find that at info wars store calm well
[02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:59.180]  Anthony certainly as we're getting close to these conventions everybody's
[02:26:59.180 --> 02:27:03.660]  wondering what's going to happen I mean we're we're seeing everything hyped up
[02:27:03.660 --> 02:27:07.660]  on both sides both sides are really doubling down we do have some real
[02:27:07.660 --> 02:27:11.860]  problems in what we're asking the government to do what we're asking the
[02:27:11.860 --> 02:27:15.340]  police to do I believe there needs to be some serious reform but they're giving
[02:27:15.340 --> 02:27:19.180]  us the wrong solutions they're telling us to consolidate power more to let
[02:27:19.180 --> 02:27:23.660]  government do even more and I think that's exactly the opposite of what we
[02:27:23.660 --> 02:27:26.860]  need meanwhile you've got the people with black lives matter who have been
[02:27:26.860 --> 02:27:32.060]  fed with this educational system that's been manipulated by people like
[02:27:32.060 --> 02:27:39.380]  Obama's mentor Bill Ayers to just focus strictly on racism and they're
[02:27:39.380 --> 02:27:43.060]  doubling down so now we've got these two forces coming to a head what what
[02:27:43.060 --> 02:27:47.060]  happens at this point you know it's really easy to misguide people that are
[02:27:47.060 --> 02:27:50.580]  super angry I mean you've dealt with extremely angry people or you know I
[02:27:50.580 --> 02:27:53.540]  think about movies and stuff when the main character makes a bad decision
[02:27:53.540 --> 02:27:57.140]  because they're so angry you know they have some some resent in there or
[02:27:57.140 --> 02:28:01.660]  something like that just unfiltered hatred and the media has a magnifying
[02:28:01.660 --> 02:28:04.900]  glass just like you can use a magnifying glass on the Sun to hit
[02:28:04.900 --> 02:28:09.620]  something unfiltered hatred unfiltered rage people are mad I mean 62 percent of
[02:28:09.620 --> 02:28:12.220]  people have us in a thousand dollars in their bank account they're overworked
[02:28:12.220 --> 02:28:17.060]  they're depressed people now are more depressed than ever they see the news
[02:28:17.060 --> 02:28:20.620]  they see the news the juxtaposition that stocks have been higher than ever and
[02:28:20.620 --> 02:28:25.620]  they see things like this HSBC avoided US money-longering charges because of
[02:28:25.620 --> 02:28:30.820]  quote market risk fears which actually meant that the US said well you know if
[02:28:30.820 --> 02:28:34.540]  we went after the banks for what they did it could it could impact the global
[02:28:34.540 --> 02:28:37.780]  economy it could cause a global disaster because we need the banks and
[02:28:37.780 --> 02:28:42.420]  interestingly enough Loretta Lynch and FBI Director Comey were both part of the
[02:28:42.420 --> 02:28:48.620]  justice system that gave them a pass at that point time yeah they see this
[02:28:48.620 --> 02:28:53.900]  these days they see the scam they see the big joke they see the FBI director
[02:28:53.900 --> 02:28:57.100]  saying everything's fine they see all this stuff and they're mad they're
[02:28:57.100 --> 02:29:02.180]  pissed off unfiltered rage now the difference is you see in some country
[02:29:02.180 --> 02:29:05.380]  some scenarios throughout history you see where they're mad at one thing right
[02:29:05.380 --> 02:29:08.780]  they're mad at one leader they're mad at one politician they're mad at one other
[02:29:08.780 --> 02:29:15.060]  country well you know whatever it is we're just mad period America is just mad
[02:29:15.060 --> 02:29:20.300]  period so what happens when you're just full of rage is someone can direct you
[02:29:20.300 --> 02:29:23.780]  pretty easily right even let's say in a personal level someone did something to
[02:29:23.780 --> 02:29:26.140]  your family or something you could say well you know it's those people it's
[02:29:26.140 --> 02:29:29.260]  those people and you might go after them because you're not very reasonable when
[02:29:29.260 --> 02:29:32.300]  you're mad and these statistics that we're gonna get into show people are
[02:29:32.300 --> 02:29:36.380]  mad they are madder than ever they're more angry than ever and then the media
[02:29:36.380 --> 02:29:39.820]  says oh it's this this is what you should be mad about yeah they try to read
[02:29:39.820 --> 02:29:43.740]  that this is what you should be mad about and it filters it it focuses it like
[02:29:43.740 --> 02:29:47.260]  a laser beam and now they know that everybody in Western civilization is
[02:29:47.260 --> 02:29:49.740]  getting upset with the raw deal we get it's why they call the pretend they'll
[02:29:49.740 --> 02:30:00.180]  be right back the empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network let's
[02:30:00.180 --> 02:30:04.500]  face it most of us are totally addicted to our cell phones but recent studies
[02:30:04.500 --> 02:30:08.780]  link cell phone use to major health issues including brain cancer experts
[02:30:08.780 --> 02:30:13.300]  say parents and expecting mothers need to be extra careful doctors say the infant
[02:30:13.300 --> 02:30:17.180]  brain even while in the womb is especially vulnerable so keep the phone
[02:30:17.180 --> 02:30:21.740]  away from your abdomen especially toward the end of pregnancy and for men using
[02:30:21.740 --> 02:30:25.820]  a cell phone for as little as an hour a day is literally cooking your sperm
[02:30:25.820 --> 02:30:30.260]  lowering sperm count levels so much that conceiving a child could be difficult
[02:30:30.260 --> 02:30:33.860]  this is one of those times you want to keep it out of your pants and for those
[02:30:33.860 --> 02:30:37.620]  of us who use our cell phones before bed know that the screen light is actually
[02:30:37.620 --> 02:30:41.500]  disrupting your sleep rhythms this causes insomnia and slow some metabolism
[02:30:41.500 --> 02:30:45.820]  hello weight gain generally speaking when cell phones are on they're constantly
[02:30:45.820 --> 02:30:49.700]  emitting radio frequency radiation so keep your phone in airplane mode when
[02:30:49.700 --> 02:30:53.860]  you can keep the phone at least two feet away from your body use headphones and
[02:30:53.860 --> 02:30:56.900]  when you're not on your phone keep it as far away from you as possible

[02:33:16.380 --> 02:33:28.300]  texas worldwide we're talking about I guess we're talking about the
[02:33:28.300 --> 02:33:31.740]  mccarrion aren't we that's what bill deberg was concerned about you were
[02:33:31.740 --> 02:33:35.780]  talking about the different financial metrics that we see here the fact is the
[02:33:35.780 --> 02:33:40.780]  vast majority the populations in western countries are seeing their standard
[02:33:40.780 --> 02:33:45.940]  of living stagnate or decline meanwhile the few elite are doing really really
[02:33:45.940 --> 02:33:50.500]  well and they're looking at this and saying hey we have a precarious proletariat
[02:33:50.500 --> 02:33:55.100]  how can we control them I know we can put them on welfare we can do to them
[02:33:55.100 --> 02:33:59.140]  what we have done to the Indians on the reservation to black people in inner
[02:33:59.140 --> 02:34:03.500]  city we've had the same libertarian economists like Charles Murray who wrote
[02:34:03.500 --> 02:34:07.100]  the book losing ground they used for welfare reform in the Reagan
[02:34:07.100 --> 02:34:11.620]  administration saying look the welfare system is destroying the black family
[02:34:11.620 --> 02:34:16.580]  this is not helping them now he's coming out and supporting a universal basic
[02:34:16.580 --> 02:34:22.260]  income as a way to pacify everyone in the society you know you said it really
[02:34:22.260 --> 02:34:25.580]  well before we went to break said basically people are served a bad deal
[02:34:25.580 --> 02:34:29.860]  and what happens is the person that serve them bad deal the system rather
[02:34:29.860 --> 02:34:33.580]  that serve them the bad deal says it's not my fault it's your fault yeah you
[02:34:33.580 --> 02:34:37.500]  know it's the people looting the economy it's the people that point zero zero zero
[02:34:37.500 --> 02:34:40.780]  one percent of people that are in the financial industry working with the
[02:34:40.780 --> 02:34:45.060]  banks in the bank systems destroying the economy in one way or another 2008 times
[02:34:45.060 --> 02:34:47.980]  you know multiple times throughout history over and over and over again
[02:34:47.980 --> 02:34:51.420]  doing these illegal things the government saying oh it's fine we don't
[02:34:51.420 --> 02:34:55.660]  want to go after the banks those people doing all of this the average person 62
[02:34:55.660 --> 02:34:58.660]  percent more than half has less than a thousand dollars in the bank account
[02:34:58.660 --> 02:35:03.300]  they're working more than ever they are depressed they're angry I mean BBC says
[02:35:03.300 --> 02:35:09.180]  why are Americans so angry Americans are generally known for having a positive
[02:35:09.180 --> 02:35:13.100]  outlook on life it says I didn't know that but with the countdown for November's
[02:35:13.100 --> 02:35:17.900]  presidential election now underway poll show voters are angry the CNN ORC poll
[02:35:17.900 --> 02:35:22.940]  carried out in December 2015 suggests that 69% almost 70% of Americans are
[02:35:22.940 --> 02:35:27.500]  either quote very angry or somewhat angry about the way things are going in
[02:35:27.500 --> 02:35:34.380]  the United States 70% of the United States why wouldn't they be yeah I am we
[02:35:34.380 --> 02:35:38.740]  know we've got a hundred percent yeah look at NAFTA okay we were told hey
[02:35:38.740 --> 02:35:42.580]  this is going to destroy your economy okay Ross bro said giant sucking sound
[02:35:42.580 --> 02:35:46.780]  Donald Trump was talking about it 20 30 years ago and now we've looked at it and
[02:35:46.780 --> 02:35:50.300]  we've seen exactly what it did immediately as it went in we had roughly a
[02:35:50.300 --> 02:35:54.940]  trade parity with Mexico for example it shot up to a $15 billion a year deficit
[02:35:54.940 --> 02:35:58.900]  it's never been less than that okay and so we're losing a massive amount of
[02:35:58.900 --> 02:36:02.500]  jobs and all this other income we're told that free trade is great because you
[02:36:02.500 --> 02:36:05.900]  can get other people like people in China to work for you for free so why
[02:36:05.900 --> 02:36:09.900]  wouldn't you let them work for you free they always sell you the easy path we're
[02:36:09.900 --> 02:36:13.660]  gonna make you comfortable we're gonna make you safe we're just gonna take your
[02:36:13.660 --> 02:36:16.860]  ability to earn money we're gonna take your freedom your liberty and your
[02:36:16.860 --> 02:36:22.020]  independence these the buzzwords and I have always said we are failing we are
[02:36:22.020 --> 02:36:26.540]  losing we are being taken advantage of because of our lack of understanding of
[02:36:26.540 --> 02:36:30.740]  the details so what you just said what you just said in about 30 seconds you
[02:36:30.740 --> 02:36:34.460]  had on multiple different points that was all details right so details are
[02:36:34.460 --> 02:36:38.120]  hard details are really hard because people number one I'll give them some
[02:36:38.120 --> 02:36:42.260]  credit they are working all day their lives can be pretty bad people are
[02:36:42.260 --> 02:36:45.500]  depressed people are angry people have problems they come home they watch
[02:36:45.500 --> 02:36:48.620]  television they don't get to watch shows like this or they don't choose to watch
[02:36:48.620 --> 02:36:52.340]  shows like this rather the content they consume is junk it's cheese whiz
[02:36:52.340 --> 02:36:56.900]  equivalent of content they're sure they just want to escape and what happens is
[02:36:56.900 --> 02:37:01.140]  you have the so-called sausage makers you know the people in the kitchens the
[02:37:01.140 --> 02:37:05.060]  mainstream media they come out and they don't say well hey let's go after these
[02:37:05.060 --> 02:37:09.020]  people let's talk about HSBC let's talk about why Americans are frustrated
[02:37:09.020 --> 02:37:12.940]  let's talk about Black Lives Matter protesters killing cops as a symptom of
[02:37:12.940 --> 02:37:16.580]  frustration let's talk about the actual specific things let's talk about you
[02:37:16.580 --> 02:37:19.740]  know the fringe people that are radicals the craziness because not everyone in
[02:37:19.740 --> 02:37:23.580]  Black Lives Matter is bad no that's all details that's not good enough it has to
[02:37:23.580 --> 02:37:29.900]  be this is it a or b black or white race whatever it's simple it's it's simple
[02:37:29.900 --> 02:37:34.100]  simple simple so served on a silver platter for that person to just gobble
[02:37:34.100 --> 02:37:38.380]  up because they don't have the capacity at that point because they're all
[02:37:38.380 --> 02:37:41.220]  stressed out they're not having the right content choices they're eating junk
[02:37:41.220 --> 02:37:44.420]  they feel like junk they're depressed they're upset all it takes of the
[02:37:44.420 --> 02:37:47.900]  mainstream media so here's a little niblet you know here it is served up on
[02:37:47.900 --> 02:37:52.140]  a platter this is why you're mad well a good example of this or is the solution
[02:37:52.140 --> 02:37:56.380]  quote-unquote that's being offered to us by the media by the government and that
[02:37:56.380 --> 02:37:59.460]  is well you know you need to have federal control over the police they never
[02:37:59.460 --> 02:38:03.300]  talk about having more local control they never even talk about let's say
[02:38:03.300 --> 02:38:06.900]  privatizing the police we've got an article about that on info wars.com I
[02:38:06.900 --> 02:38:10.100]  mean that would be an interesting idea that we could talk about the different
[02:38:10.100 --> 02:38:13.980]  ways that we could structure changing the mission of the police so that they're
[02:38:13.980 --> 02:38:17.940]  not focused on generating revenue with petty fines different things like that
[02:38:17.940 --> 02:38:22.100]  but they won't talk about that they already have as you pointed out the
[02:38:22.100 --> 02:38:26.020]  choice that they're going to offer you when they create the problem problem
[02:38:26.020 --> 02:38:29.860]  solution here's a solution we've already worked out and the solution is going to
[02:38:29.860 --> 02:38:34.660]  be more of the same and you know the police confiscate like a hundred plus
[02:38:34.660 --> 02:38:37.460]  million dollars and I think it's Arkansas or something there's craziness
[02:38:37.460 --> 02:38:40.860]  but my question is yeah number one because remember we lose on the details
[02:38:40.860 --> 02:38:46.180]  if I don't say that the details we will lose there is real discrimination most
[02:38:46.180 --> 02:38:50.740]  police officers it appears I mean considering there's plenty of them are
[02:38:50.740 --> 02:38:55.380]  genuinely good intentioned people I've been mistreated by the police in my past
[02:38:55.380 --> 02:38:59.100]  but I don't hold it against every police officer I've been mistreated by white
[02:38:59.100 --> 02:39:02.260]  people black people all all types of people I don't hold it against every
[02:39:02.260 --> 02:39:06.340]  single person that is that type that's discriminated discrimination in and of
[02:39:06.340 --> 02:39:10.140]  itself to say all cops are bad I s I appreciate what the police do for me just
[02:39:10.140 --> 02:39:13.380]  as I appreciate what other people do for me but isn't even about the police is
[02:39:13.380 --> 02:39:16.500]  what I'm saying isn't even about the police I don't know I mean when you have
[02:39:16.500 --> 02:39:21.300]  this is a good article 19 numbers which prove that Americans are angrier and
[02:39:21.300 --> 02:39:27.780]  more frustrated than ever so you have 70% of Americans do not feel engaged or
[02:39:27.780 --> 02:39:31.800]  inspired at their jobs 77% of Americans believe the
[02:39:31.800 --> 02:39:37.300]  state of the economy is not good or poor 65% of Americans say they're somewhat
[02:39:37.300 --> 02:39:40.500]  dissatisfied or very dissatisfied with the overall direction of the country we
[02:39:40.500 --> 02:39:46.020]  just saw another one 69% only 4% of Americans believe it that it would
[02:39:46.020 --> 02:39:49.580]  change Congress for the worst if every member was voted out during the next
[02:39:49.580 --> 02:39:55.020]  election now think about that every member of essentially what makes the
[02:39:55.020 --> 02:40:01.540]  decisions in this country to be gone 4% say that would be bad so if it 96% of
[02:40:01.540 --> 02:40:04.580]  people say if we got rid of every single politician in Congress it would
[02:40:04.580 --> 02:40:08.220]  probably be better and yet the mental illnesses that they want to turn over
[02:40:08.220 --> 02:40:12.460]  more decisions in their life to other people that's the mental illness because
[02:40:12.460 --> 02:40:18.220]  they say 96% say Congress is terrible the government is not helping 69% say
[02:40:18.220 --> 02:40:20.540]  we're not satisfied with the direction of this country the government is
[02:40:20.540 --> 02:40:25.900]  overbearing it's 60% so they're angry and irritable 65% they're dissatisfied
[02:40:25.900 --> 02:40:31.180]  with the US system of government period right but then what's the solution more
[02:40:31.180 --> 02:40:35.500]  federal control of the police more federal control of this higher minimum
[02:40:35.500 --> 02:40:39.820]  wage we need more federal spending we need sustenance of all levels from the
[02:40:39.820 --> 02:40:44.820]  government heat instead of saying wait a minute that is what did it so you can't
[02:40:44.820 --> 02:40:48.900]  go back to keep you can't what broke you's not gonna fix you that's right
[02:40:48.900 --> 02:40:51.820]  but we have mental illness we do it all in our personal lives to whatever broke
[02:40:51.820 --> 02:40:55.300]  you you know that's gonna fix me you go back and back and back because we're
[02:40:55.300 --> 02:41:00.820]  a reliant population now we're reliant that's right people don't value their
[02:41:00.820 --> 02:41:04.620]  freedom their independence it's this kind of mental illness that Alex was
[02:41:04.620 --> 02:41:08.700]  talking about what Pokemon go okay they just want to be distracted they want to
[02:41:08.700 --> 02:41:14.860]  have if you look at the like classified yeah bases looking looking for the
[02:41:14.860 --> 02:41:18.220]  Pokemon that's gonna be that's gonna happen I know that's gonna happen yeah
[02:41:18.220 --> 02:41:22.980]  but you know you look at the situation with these self-driving cars they
[02:41:22.980 --> 02:41:26.620]  want to call 90% of the people in New York and California want to give up that
[02:41:26.620 --> 02:41:30.460]  control of their life they don't want to have the freedom and the independence
[02:41:30.460 --> 02:41:34.300]  of movement that we've historically had they want to be taxed and tracked and
[02:41:34.300 --> 02:41:38.700]  prevented from moving if they haven't paid all of their bills or whatever for
[02:41:38.700 --> 02:41:42.700]  whatever reason the government wants to do that they want something else to even
[02:41:42.700 --> 02:41:46.420]  move them from place to place how pathetic is that but see that's that
[02:41:46.420 --> 02:41:50.100]  that's the details man they're serving on a donut on silver platter saying you
[02:41:50.100 --> 02:41:54.460]  could sleep while you drive yeah doesn't matter about the taxes no no no you can
[02:41:54.460 --> 02:41:59.460]  sleep while you drive you go on your laptop you can play Pokemon go on your
[02:41:59.460 --> 02:42:03.180]  phone while you are driving all right that's that's how they sell it I'm
[02:42:03.180 --> 02:42:07.780]  it drives you under a semi-trailer yeah thanks off your head right range or
[02:42:07.780 --> 02:42:10.740]  whatever you know I mean innovation is good but no one thinks about these
[02:42:10.740 --> 02:42:14.380]  details like I said and that's why everyone is depressed and then they say
[02:42:14.380 --> 02:42:19.420]  oh you know all these endless articles endless articles Americans are more
[02:42:19.420 --> 02:42:22.300]  depressed than decades ago why are they so angry why are they so frustrated why
[02:42:22.300 --> 02:42:26.020]  are more people killing themselves never and then oh three quarters of UK
[02:42:26.020 --> 02:42:29.540]  children spend less time outdoors than prison inmates I wonder what it is for
[02:42:29.540 --> 02:42:33.460]  the US kids aren't even allowed to go outside anymore I mean they're so
[02:42:33.460 --> 02:42:37.740]  sheltered and then people are also upset and depressed because their standards
[02:42:37.740 --> 02:42:42.420]  are so off and different and absurd or skewer I mean they're so worried about
[02:42:42.420 --> 02:42:46.540]  microaggressions of being upset and being offended by someone's free speech
[02:42:46.540 --> 02:42:51.220]  that they go into a tussle they go into a rage I mean think about it old-school
[02:42:51.220 --> 02:42:56.260]  version of this would be a bear is killing you and you're into a freakout rage
[02:42:56.260 --> 02:43:00.400]  or like invaders are coming to kill your entire village and slaughter your
[02:43:00.400 --> 02:43:05.420]  family and and rape your women and you go into a rage now it's someone said
[02:43:05.420 --> 02:43:10.020]  something that's a microaggression online that is the same systemic response
[02:43:10.020 --> 02:43:14.300]  biologically that we're having now we've changed we've upgraded we've become
[02:43:14.300 --> 02:43:18.060]  sloth creatures that sit around and have nothing real to be worried about
[02:43:18.060 --> 02:43:21.700]  because we're not focusing on the real issues we just want to create little
[02:43:21.700 --> 02:43:24.940]  things to be upset about that are total distractions and total
[02:43:24.940 --> 02:43:28.580]  meticulousness and then we're forced here on this program where we want to talk
[02:43:28.580 --> 02:43:31.660]  about real stuff we want to talk about the the banks making billions of
[02:43:31.660 --> 02:43:34.780]  billions of dollars on taxpayer money after they swindled everybody and
[02:43:34.780 --> 02:43:37.220]  screwed everybody and the government says they can't do it because there
[02:43:37.220 --> 02:43:41.300]  could be market risk fears so we want to talk about that stuff but guess what now
[02:43:41.300 --> 02:43:44.900]  we got a battle this stuff we got a battle the fake political correctness
[02:43:44.900 --> 02:43:49.900]  we got a battle the microaggression police we got a battle I mean we're
[02:43:49.900 --> 02:43:54.620]  saying we're bad for saying that it's not good to kill police officers I
[02:43:54.620 --> 02:43:58.900]  mean that's absurd I made a post about that about the police saying you know
[02:43:58.900 --> 02:44:02.180]  there's some discrimination but it's good to support the police officers that
[02:44:02.180 --> 02:44:06.980]  do good and people would say things truly like kill the police they said all
[02:44:06.980 --> 02:44:10.700]  pigs are bad you know stuff like that I'm talking about 20 30 people saying
[02:44:10.700 --> 02:44:14.260]  really really bad death threats well it's not even a connection to the third if
[02:44:14.260 --> 02:44:17.660]  they don't even believe that it's just raw unfiltered rage is that even a
[02:44:17.660 --> 02:44:21.740]  connection to the same police department or the same city that had the things
[02:44:21.740 --> 02:44:24.740]  that they're upset about I mean they're they're going after totally innocent
[02:44:24.740 --> 02:44:28.740]  people and as this guy said he's going after these people simply because they're
[02:44:28.740 --> 02:44:33.300]  police or simply because they're white and that's the kind of mental illness
[02:44:33.300 --> 02:44:37.620]  that we see happening here it all goes back I think to the fact that people are
[02:44:37.620 --> 02:44:41.740]  just looking at ways to spend their time and not to invest their time they're
[02:44:41.740 --> 02:44:46.140]  not looking at where what they want to do with their lives preparing a better
[02:44:46.140 --> 02:44:50.060]  life for their children you know as you were talking earlier about Chinese
[02:44:50.060 --> 02:44:54.860]  saying the middle class has grown twice as fast as that in the United States
[02:44:54.860 --> 02:44:57.740]  they're they're seeing an increase in the standard of living that's not to say
[02:44:57.740 --> 02:45:03.300]  that their absolute wealth is better than ours at this point but they see
[02:45:03.300 --> 02:45:07.380]  things that are gradually improving that makes you happy that gives you dreams
[02:45:07.380 --> 02:45:10.940]  that gives you goals it gives you a future that you can look into and
[02:45:10.940 --> 02:45:14.780]  they're making things okay now some of them are making things under slave
[02:45:14.780 --> 02:45:18.220]  labor conditions and that's not a good thing but but they're creating wealth
[02:45:18.220 --> 02:45:21.620]  because manufacturing has been moved over there meanwhile we've got the people
[02:45:21.620 --> 02:45:25.380]  who are selling free trade telling us hey these people work for free they'll
[02:45:25.380 --> 02:45:30.580]  work as your slaves why not use them and then we wind up in this service economy
[02:45:30.580 --> 02:45:34.180]  where we're just doing each other's laundry we're not creating a future
[02:45:34.180 --> 02:45:37.900]  we're just living off of our current status but then it even goes from that
[02:45:37.900 --> 02:45:41.420]  we had Gary Johnson talking about yeah well you know free trade is great
[02:45:41.420 --> 02:45:45.100]  because of that and and you know we got these clean service industries but the
[02:45:45.100 --> 02:45:49.660]  future is uber the gig economy where you're going to not own anything you're
[02:45:49.660 --> 02:45:53.220]  not even going to have a full-time service job you're gonna have this
[02:45:53.220 --> 02:45:56.660]  precarious position that's where the precarious are you have this precarious
[02:45:56.660 --> 02:46:01.100]  position where you know the guy who's running uber wants to own all vehicles
[02:46:01.100 --> 02:46:05.740]  and he doesn't want to have any employees so you go into this temporary job
[02:46:05.740 --> 02:46:10.140]  which is super temporary because it has absolutely no future and people think
[02:46:10.140 --> 02:46:13.540]  they're they're getting the bad end of the deal now people accept that a bad
[02:46:13.540 --> 02:46:16.860]  deal it's true and you got that Chinese at the article about the Chinese
[02:46:16.860 --> 02:46:21.460]  Academy right here says the Chinese savings network ranges from 50,000 to
[02:46:21.460 --> 02:46:25.780]  500,000 the momentum gained traction in 2000 since that time China's middle
[02:46:25.780 --> 02:46:29.340]  class has grown at twice the US rate these numbers are quite shocking when
[02:46:29.340 --> 02:46:33.100]  you consider the average worker in the US does not even have $5,000 in savings
[02:46:33.100 --> 02:46:37.380]  and earlier we talked about that 62% of less than a thousand so I mean if you
[02:46:37.380 --> 02:46:41.860]  don't make anything you're not going to if you lose your manufacturing
[02:46:41.860 --> 02:46:44.780]  capability not only do you become dependent on other countries you got to
[02:46:44.780 --> 02:46:48.820]  buy your manufactured goods even for your military it's impossible to buy
[02:46:48.820 --> 02:46:53.140]  anything these days it's not from China and even at a large level business to
[02:46:53.140 --> 02:46:58.620]  business level right when I'm looking at stuff to buy like real products even the
[02:46:58.620 --> 02:47:02.860]  manufacturers that we work with and stuff they all say it's almost impossible
[02:47:02.860 --> 02:47:07.060]  to avoid China now because they have a monopoly on the entire system and we are
[02:47:07.060 --> 02:47:10.340]  weird because we say well we don't want the Chinese stuff they're like well it's
[02:47:10.340 --> 02:47:14.460]  way less way less money I mean you're gonna make way more money say no we don't
[02:47:14.460 --> 02:47:18.740]  want it actually you know in terms of a hat or something you know every now and
[02:47:18.740 --> 02:47:21.460]  then that's fine I'm talking about something you're gonna ingest in your
[02:47:21.460 --> 02:47:26.620]  body you know those yeah well this version of the you know vitamin C or
[02:47:26.620 --> 02:47:30.260]  whatever from China is way cheaper it's way better it's high quality no it's not
[02:47:30.260 --> 02:47:34.420]  I know what it is yeah you know well I mean it gets back to the point where if
[02:47:34.420 --> 02:47:38.780]  you get all your hats from China then who's gonna buy your products that you
[02:47:38.780 --> 02:47:41.900]  make here if you in fact make anything or if you want to do other people's
[02:47:41.900 --> 02:47:45.180]  laundry what are they going how are they going to pay you that's what we see
[02:47:45.180 --> 02:47:49.020]  happening now with the robot economy that's gonna replace and disrupt
[02:47:49.020 --> 02:47:52.820]  everything both horizontally and vertically it's going to affect every
[02:47:52.820 --> 02:47:56.140]  industry horizontally it's going to affect every different level from blue
[02:47:56.140 --> 02:48:00.340]  color to the top white color jobs it's gonna be incredibly disruptive and it's
[02:48:00.340 --> 02:48:06.740]  really going to create a precariat okay that is multi-class based and throughout
[02:48:06.740 --> 02:48:10.500]  all these different industries it's precisely what they have done to us with
[02:48:10.500 --> 02:48:14.300]  China and we look at China we say well I don't want to work under these slave
[02:48:14.300 --> 02:48:17.580]  labor conditions where people are committing suicide they got to you
[02:48:17.580 --> 02:48:21.940]  know have suicide nets out there in the Foxconn factories and everything it's a
[02:48:21.940 --> 02:48:25.260]  horrible living conditions but you know quite frankly it's a step up for these
[02:48:25.260 --> 02:48:29.380]  people from the conditions that they were under under chairman Mao okay so now
[02:48:29.380 --> 02:48:33.940]  we've got socialism being sold to us as well as a decline in our standard of
[02:48:33.940 --> 02:48:38.100]  living it's a very bleak process if we don't get control things I think that's
[02:48:38.100 --> 02:48:43.500]  one of the key things we look at Donald Trump the idea that we are going to put
[02:48:43.500 --> 02:48:47.420]  America first that we're going to start to reclaim our independence one of the
[02:48:47.420 --> 02:48:51.500]  things to do that is to have tariffs you know we got rid of we used to run our
[02:48:51.500 --> 02:48:55.740]  country when it was constitutional size on tariffs alone Thomas Jefferson
[02:48:55.740 --> 02:48:59.180]  bragged about the fact that nobody internally in America knew a tax man
[02:48:59.180 --> 02:49:01.740]  that's what he said in his second inaugural because they could fund the
[02:49:01.740 --> 02:49:08.140]  entire government simply on tariffs when we got the income tax okay when we got
[02:49:08.140 --> 02:49:11.220]  all that put in they changed the tax structure they gave us the income tax
[02:49:11.220 --> 02:49:14.740]  they cut the tariffs they gave us the federal reserve that's when everything
[02:49:14.740 --> 02:49:19.380]  changed in 1913 it's been a awful system for us for the last 100 years you know
[02:49:19.380 --> 02:49:22.420]  earlier we were talking about if you were a doctor and you looked at America as a
[02:49:22.420 --> 02:49:25.460]  country and you give a diagnosis you wouldn't just look at the symptoms the
[02:49:25.460 --> 02:49:30.220]  root issue I think a doctor a psychiatrist well trained psychiatrist would
[02:49:30.220 --> 02:49:34.420]  look at America and say that America has a mental sickness really I mean it's
[02:49:34.420 --> 02:49:37.780]  good I think it's a friend think about what you just said so you were talking
[02:49:37.780 --> 02:49:43.060]  earlier you know people say that for example okay a cop potentially
[02:49:43.060 --> 02:49:47.260]  discriminated and killed a black person okay kill cops wait wait what and then
[02:49:47.260 --> 02:49:53.020]  you say you know America's economy is bad okay ship everything to China
[02:49:53.020 --> 02:49:57.900]  everything that we do it seems is a complete insane reaction like the banks
[02:49:57.900 --> 02:50:02.460]  are looting everything oh we need to tax more of the lower income people yeah it's
[02:50:02.460 --> 02:50:07.300]  it's like or oh the point zero zero zero one percent is destroying the world and
[02:50:07.300 --> 02:50:11.700]  then some of the population says all rich people are bad but wait wait what
[02:50:11.700 --> 02:50:16.340]  wealth is bad people owned businesses are bad they need to pay more taxes it's
[02:50:16.340 --> 02:50:21.660]  all just insanity almost at every single level of it clearly there's they're
[02:50:21.660 --> 02:50:24.980]  saying people but stuff like this is just a creep up because when you're you're
[02:50:24.980 --> 02:50:29.100]  focused on the insanity stuff like this is gonna creep up world food prices post
[02:50:29.100 --> 02:50:32.460]  biggest rise for four years in June we've talked about this quite a bit
[02:50:32.460 --> 02:50:36.340]  before but world food prices posted their biggest monthly rise for four years
[02:50:36.340 --> 02:50:40.580]  in June buoyed by a surge in sugar and increased for most other edible
[02:50:40.580 --> 02:50:45.620]  commodities the UN food agency said on Thursday so as we're busy just being

[02:54:32.700 --> 02:54:36.740]  going to be quite a fight inside and outside of the convention I think
[02:54:36.740 --> 02:54:42.020]  although we saw Bernie Sanders bury the hatchet with Hillary Clinton today he
[02:54:42.020 --> 02:54:45.500]  doesn't have a problem with the trans-pacific partnership he just wants
[02:54:45.500 --> 02:54:49.900]  her to win at this point but we still have Republicans who are fighting
[02:54:49.900 --> 02:54:52.660]  Donald Trump we're going to be there covering it one of the ways that you

[02:55:39.660 --> 02:55:44.980]  week this is something that the that Alex's dad who's been a practicing
[02:55:44.980 --> 02:55:49.460]  dentist for 30 years said it's the best teeth whitening system that he has seen
[02:55:49.460 --> 02:55:54.940]  in his 30 years of practice it's a three-way system it uses a sonic toothbrush
[02:55:54.940 --> 02:55:59.500]  that vibrates an average of 27,000 times a minute for a very deep clean as well
[02:55:59.500 --> 02:56:06.020]  as a whitening gel and a blue wavelength technology now the blue wavelength
[02:56:06.020 --> 02:56:09.860]  technology activates that whitening gel it also kills bacteria it's a great
[02:56:09.860 --> 02:56:13.260]  system take a look at info wars store.com for limited time you can get
[02:56:13.260 --> 02:56:18.980]  nearly 25% off your second go smile sonic pro system it's part of our exclusive
[02:56:18.980 --> 02:56:24.620]  listener special at info wars store.com Anthony we're talking during the break
[02:56:24.620 --> 02:56:32.420]  about Jeb making his first statements for quite some time at the close to the
[02:56:32.420 --> 02:56:36.340]  convention starting this next Monday yet I thought a couple of interesting
[02:56:36.340 --> 02:56:41.780]  things to say he said that he would be very sad if Trump was elected he would
[02:56:41.780 --> 02:56:46.780]  be very worried and yet he says if Hillary is elected he'll feel vindicated
[02:56:46.780 --> 02:56:52.860]  no regrets there for Jeb he doesn't have our best interest at heart he has his
[02:56:52.860 --> 02:56:57.820]  political career at heart doesn't he? You know it did remind me of the story
[02:56:57.820 --> 02:57:00.820]  that we're talking about in the break because this individual actually also
[02:57:00.820 --> 02:57:07.820]  lost 90% of his brain this is a very interesting story to close out with so
[02:57:07.820 --> 02:57:11.620]  says a civil servant missing most of his brain challenges our most basic
[02:57:11.620 --> 02:57:17.540]  theories of consciousness so this guy had a had a medical condition and 90% of
[02:57:17.540 --> 02:57:22.580]  his brain was destroyed but he's still walking around as a married father of
[02:57:22.580 --> 02:57:26.420]  two and a civil servant doing his own thing I mean he's just so he's functioning
[02:57:26.420 --> 02:57:30.240]  better than Jeb so I wonder what presented Jeb is functioning way better than
[02:57:30.240 --> 02:57:36.500]  Jeb Bush so I actually think he's Jeb should hire him as an advisor but if you
[02:57:36.500 --> 02:57:39.700]  look at the picture on the article basically pretty much all his brain is
[02:57:39.700 --> 02:57:44.460]  gone and they thought for sure he would just kind of be a you know a vegetable
[02:57:44.460 --> 02:57:48.060]  brain dead or whatever and it took 30 years for this to happen fluid build up
[02:57:48.060 --> 02:57:51.220]  in his brain and stuff but he's totally fine he has he has a lower than normal
[02:57:51.220 --> 02:57:55.140]  IQ for sure it's very low I don't know it doesn't specify if he was born that
[02:57:55.140 --> 02:58:01.340]  way or not but he's walking around his father of two kids with his 90% of his
[02:58:01.340 --> 02:58:04.380]  brain missing so it's very interesting it changes everything we know about what
[02:58:04.380 --> 02:58:06.820]  is consciousness and self-awareness everything like that so well we don't
[02:58:06.820 --> 02:58:10.980]  know what Jeb's IQ is but we can take some educated guesses this headline from
[02:58:10.980 --> 02:58:13.660]  for the record I think we should elect this person as president that's right
[02:58:13.660 --> 02:58:18.380]  from Breitbart says Jeb says conservatism is temporarily dead and the
[02:58:18.380 --> 02:58:23.540]  Pope's border mass fueled Trump you know Jeb is temporarily dead and especially
[02:58:23.540 --> 02:58:28.300]  if he doesn't realize that the Pope's open borders hurt him what does he think
[02:58:28.300 --> 02:58:32.380]  open borders that he was pushing did for him I mean that was a central part of
[02:58:32.380 --> 02:58:35.780]  what he was pushing stay with us Paul Joseph Watson is going to be back for
[02:58:35.780 --> 02:58:40.580]  the fourth hour Manthony we're Anthony Goodrarty and David Knight thanks you

[03:00:35.900 --> 03:00:40.500]  the bottom of the hour by transgender YouTube commentator Blair White now she
[03:00:40.500 --> 03:00:46.620]  uploaded she posted a video that was critical of black lives matter and just
[03:00:46.620 --> 03:00:51.980]  wait until you hear about the hatred the harassment that she received as a result
[03:00:51.980 --> 03:00:58.140]  she was doxxed her address was revealed her family was targeted by these black
[03:00:58.140 --> 03:01:03.380]  lives matter extremists but CNN told me Sally Cohn told me that this was a
[03:01:03.380 --> 03:01:08.300]  peaceful group surely this can't be we're going to talk to Blair White at the
[03:01:08.300 --> 03:01:12.260]  bottom of the hour but again we've seen this narrative after Dallas over and
[03:01:12.260 --> 03:01:16.380]  over again I'm going to delve more into it after the break that black lives
[03:01:16.380 --> 03:01:23.500]  matter is just a peaceful group how many videos how many Facebook posts how many
[03:01:23.500 --> 03:01:30.460]  actual violent attacks on cops on other people do we have to see before we change
[03:01:30.460 --> 03:01:35.940]  this narrative that black lives matter is a peaceful group police officers in
[03:01:35.940 --> 03:01:42.860]  St Paul Minnesota having concrete blocks dropped on their head that happened
[03:01:42.860 --> 03:01:47.860]  on Saturday officers suffered a fractured spine throwing fireworks at
[03:01:47.860 --> 03:01:53.620]  police officers rallying up protesters saying we need to bust the cap in police
[03:01:53.620 --> 03:01:58.180]  officers we need to run them down we need to run up on them we've got more
[03:01:58.180 --> 03:02:01.300]  news about this today I'm going to get into it more after the break but the
[03:02:01.300 --> 03:02:06.420]  indie channel is reporting I am PD officers how shot five times man in
[03:02:06.420 --> 03:02:12.260]  custody this was a black lives matter supporter got out of his vehicle yelled
[03:02:12.260 --> 03:02:18.020]  F the police and shot at this officer's house and car with his 10-year-old son
[03:02:18.020 --> 03:02:23.260]  in the house again this is a peaceful group of course don't forget Sally Cohn
[03:02:23.260 --> 03:02:28.020]  CNN told me this is out of the Detroit news Detroit police arrest four for
[03:02:28.020 --> 03:02:31.860]  threats against cops Detroit police arrested four men for allegedly
[03:02:31.860 --> 03:02:35.700]  threatening on Facebook to kill police officers one of the men reportedly
[03:02:35.700 --> 03:02:41.620]  posted quote all lives can't matter until black lives matter kill all white
[03:02:41.620 --> 03:02:48.860]  cops but again black lives matter is a peaceful group CNN told me Sally Cohn
[03:02:48.860 --> 03:02:55.020]  told me in fact Sally Cohn told me that she hadn't seen anyone from black lives
[03:02:55.020 --> 03:03:00.580]  matter anyone sympathetic with black lives matter celebrating or justifying
[03:03:00.580 --> 03:03:07.940]  the attack on the Dallas police officers really really you can go on Twitter at
[03:03:07.940 --> 03:03:13.700]  any minute of the day and see people celebrating this attack go on to Twitter
[03:03:13.700 --> 03:03:19.940]  right now and chant in pigs cops black lives matter you will see thousands of
[03:03:19.940 --> 03:03:25.140]  people every single day celebrating these attacks justifying these attacks
[03:03:25.140 --> 03:03:30.680]  because as the El Paso police chief said the other day this is a domestic hate
[03:03:30.680 --> 03:03:35.820]  group if you had a bunch of you know right-wing Christians who said that
[03:03:35.820 --> 03:03:40.460]  their ideological inspiration was the Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh and
[03:03:40.460 --> 03:03:45.380]  that they wanted to kill all black people they marched in major cities
[03:03:45.380 --> 03:03:49.900]  chanting to kill all black people they posted on Facebook and Twitter we want
[03:03:49.900 --> 03:03:55.780]  to kill all black people they violently attacked black people imagine if that was
[03:03:55.780 --> 03:04:01.180]  the situation how would the media treat it would the media venerate such a group
[03:04:01.180 --> 03:04:06.620]  as you know a bold new protest movement a bold new frontier in civil rights of
[03:04:06.620 --> 03:04:13.140]  course not they would call them violent domestic extremists we saw that just a
[03:04:13.140 --> 03:04:18.260]  few months ago up in Oregon those people weren't even violent to begin with but
[03:04:18.260 --> 03:04:21.940]  again black lives matter the founders of the organization say that their
[03:04:21.940 --> 03:04:29.100]  inspiration a starter Shakur is their guru this is a convicted cop killer who
[03:04:29.100 --> 03:04:35.740]  is on the FBI's most wanted terrorist list if right-wingers said that Timothy
[03:04:35.740 --> 03:04:40.060]  McVeigh was their inspiration and they were going to act on his message would
[03:04:40.060 --> 03:04:44.580]  the media give them a fair shake well of course not but the media has built up
[03:04:44.580 --> 03:04:48.540]  this domestic hate group and now unfortunately it's leading to more
[03:04:48.540 --> 03:04:52.820]  violent attacks we're gonna get into that after the break as well as talking
[03:04:52.820 --> 03:04:57.300]  about the latest on the migrant crisis yet another mass molestation this time
[03:04:57.300 --> 03:05:00.900]  in Sweden we'll be back this is the Alex Jones show live stage the Chinese

[03:05:05.700 --> 03:05:11.460]  a measure against possible hostile US action in the South China Sea after an
[03:05:11.460 --> 03:05:16.180]  international tribunal ruled that Beijing had no exclusive control over the
[03:05:16.180 --> 03:05:20.740]  area the permanent court of arbitration said that there was no evidence that
[03:05:20.740 --> 03:05:24.940]  China had historically exercised exclusive control over the waters or
[03:05:24.940 --> 03:05:30.540]  resources reports the BBC China responded by labeling the ruling ill-founded
[03:05:30.540 --> 03:05:35.660]  and refused to be bound by it however behind the scenes the Chinese president
[03:05:35.660 --> 03:05:40.060]  fears that the US could seize on the ruling to justify aggressive military
[03:05:40.060 --> 03:05:45.620]  maneuvers in the area and has ordered PLA forces to prepare for war China's

[03:08:19.700 --> 03:08:27.980]  well so does he. Live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones.
[03:08:28.700 --> 03:08:39.020]  This is Paul Joseph Watson with the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show because Bernie Sanders the quote anti Wall Street candidate has just endorsed the
[03:08:39.020 --> 03:08:44.020]  ultimate Wall Street insider Hillary Clinton the deadbeat communist Bernie
[03:08:44.020 --> 03:08:48.460]  Sanders betrayed all the Bernie Bros inside of with the most corrupt
[03:08:48.460 --> 03:08:54.780]  corporate politician in America well imagine my shock now the polls have said
[03:08:54.780 --> 03:09:02.460]  that they're very inaccurate they say it could be 55% in fact 45% who are not
[03:09:02.460 --> 03:09:07.380]  going to vote for Hillary up to 85% who will vote for Hillary in terms of Bernie
[03:09:07.380 --> 03:09:11.580]  Sanders supporters when it comes to the day in question will those Bernie
[03:09:11.580 --> 03:09:16.420]  Bros actually cast their vote for Hillary well I think a lot more of them will
[03:09:16.420 --> 03:09:22.540]  than those who say they will when asked by pollsters because of course they don't
[03:09:22.540 --> 03:09:26.100]  want that dirty little secret to slip out but when push comes to shove I think
[03:09:26.100 --> 03:09:31.180]  all the Bernie Bros will line up behind Hillary Clinton because if they're so
[03:09:31.180 --> 03:09:34.780]  stupid to fall for this socialist rhetoric in the first place then that
[03:09:34.780 --> 03:09:39.740]  tells you that they're easily led so even though Bernie Sanders has endorsed
[03:09:39.740 --> 03:09:45.060]  the most Wall Street friendly politician in America despite being quote the
[03:09:45.060 --> 03:09:49.460]  anti Wall Street candidate I don't think this revolt against Bernie will last
[03:09:49.460 --> 03:09:54.300]  for long on the subject of election news we've got a big exclusive story on
[03:09:54.300 --> 03:09:58.980]  info wars.com right now Bush operatives sabotage Trump effort to make release
[03:09:58.980 --> 03:10:05.620]  28 pages part of GOP platform now of course people don't realize that the
[03:10:05.620 --> 03:10:10.140]  Bush crime family still has a lot of power just because George W. Bush has
[03:10:10.140 --> 03:10:14.300]  gone half-senile and you know spends most of his time painting terrible pictures
[03:10:14.300 --> 03:10:18.820]  in the bathroom mirror doesn't mean that the Bush crime family doesn't still have
[03:10:18.820 --> 03:10:24.500]  significant power within the GOP especially with Jeb Bush so now
[03:10:24.500 --> 03:10:30.060]  according to sources close to the Trump campaign Trump himself insisted on those
[03:10:30.060 --> 03:10:34.980]  28 pages regarding Saudi Arabian involvement in 9-11 being included on
[03:10:34.980 --> 03:10:42.420]  the official GOP platform after next week's convention and it initially passed
[03:10:42.420 --> 03:10:46.860]  if you read the article you can read the plank in full delivering transparency
[03:10:46.860 --> 03:10:52.380]  on foreign government ties to 9-11 so it passed a national security subcommittee
[03:10:52.380 --> 03:10:58.060]  of the GOP platform and it went forward to the main committee but was rejected
[03:10:58.060 --> 03:11:04.820]  according to our sources after pressure from the Bushes so that's a big story up
[03:11:04.820 --> 03:11:09.020]  on info wars.com right now but I wanted to get back into black lives matter
[03:11:09.020 --> 03:11:14.820]  because of course CNN told me Sally Cohn told me that it was a really peaceful
[03:11:14.820 --> 03:11:19.380]  group even as they drop concrete blocks on officers heads throw fireworks at them
[03:11:19.380 --> 03:11:25.100]  shoot into their houses threaten to kill white cops on Facebook it's a peaceful
[03:11:25.100 --> 03:11:29.660]  group people ask me if I get death threats yes they get death threats every
[03:11:29.660 --> 03:11:34.100]  day and I post them on Twitter not because I really care not because I want
[03:11:34.100 --> 03:11:38.540]  them to have their accounts deleted I don't give a damn but it just gives you
[03:11:38.540 --> 03:11:42.780]  an insight into the fact that the tolerant peaceful left are the most
[03:11:42.780 --> 03:11:47.380]  vicious the most violent so this was a nice friendly message I received today
[03:11:47.380 --> 03:11:54.020]  you're a little bitch you live in London and talk sh it about African Americans
[03:11:54.020 --> 03:12:00.380]  it's embarrassing that you think cops aren't racist hashtag we the terrorists
[03:12:00.380 --> 03:12:07.180]  now and this nice friendly message that I receive ends you effing bitch you'll
[03:12:07.180 --> 03:12:12.220]  get killed that's from a black lives matter supporter which is a peaceful
[03:12:12.220 --> 03:12:17.740]  group because CNN told me so and again you see this division that's being
[03:12:17.740 --> 03:12:21.860]  created if you talk out if you speak out if you criticize black lives matter
[03:12:21.860 --> 03:12:25.220]  that must mean that you hate African Americans that must mean you hate black
[03:12:25.220 --> 03:12:30.020]  people the same with Islam if you talk out if you speak out if you criticize
[03:12:30.020 --> 03:12:34.900]  the ideology of Islam that must mean you hate Muslims if you speak out against
[03:12:34.900 --> 03:12:40.660]  the ideology of feminism that must mean you hate women well no because it's an
[03:12:40.660 --> 03:12:48.300]  ideology feminism is not a gender Islam is not a race and black lives matter is
[03:12:48.300 --> 03:12:55.140]  not a color it's an ideology so yes you can criticize it yes you can say it's
[03:12:55.140 --> 03:13:00.140]  leading black people down a rabbit hole it's ensconcing them in this grievance
[03:13:00.140 --> 03:13:04.900]  ghetto culture that's partly responsible for the fact that crime rates amongst
[03:13:04.900 --> 03:13:10.940]  black people in many areas of America are disproportionately high and I'm
[03:13:10.940 --> 03:13:16.620]  sorry if facts hurt your feeling if facts hurt your feelings well that's a
[03:13:16.620 --> 03:13:21.180]  fact it's a statistic you can go across the board and see it in every inner
[03:13:21.180 --> 03:13:27.260]  city in America none that subject Mark Lamont Hill this leftist race beta was
[03:13:27.260 --> 03:13:33.140]  debating a law enforcement analyst Harry Hook on CNN basically hook brought up
[03:13:33.140 --> 03:13:37.620]  these statistics that black people are prone to criminality not because of the
[03:13:37.620 --> 03:13:41.460]  pigmentation of their skin but because of the culture that glorifies
[03:13:41.460 --> 03:13:46.100]  criminality because of this socio-economic situation pushed by the left
[03:13:46.100 --> 03:13:50.500]  that keeps black people in the ghetto keeps them dependent keeps them
[03:13:50.500 --> 03:13:55.460]  dependent on food stamps keeps them dependent on welfare in return for
[03:13:55.460 --> 03:14:00.540]  votes that's why the left wants to keep black people down we've gone over it
[03:14:00.540 --> 03:14:04.660]  again and again but let's go to these two clips first Harry hook lays out the
[03:14:04.660 --> 03:14:08.180]  stats and then we'll get to the second clip when we come back here's the first
[03:14:08.180 --> 03:14:13.300]  clip from CNN when a police officer does do something bad we have a space to see
[03:14:13.300 --> 03:14:16.300]  to not have other police investigate them but instead we have civilian review
[03:14:16.300 --> 03:14:18.940]  boards if citizen review boards these sorts of things actually give us the
[03:14:18.940 --> 03:14:23.300]  kind of transparency that we need how real is it that if you were on the job
[03:14:23.300 --> 03:14:27.620]  and you knew a guy was dirty you would be worried about coming forward because
[03:14:27.620 --> 03:14:32.020]  what if it's not you know a clean situation what if it comes back on you
[03:14:32.020 --> 03:14:36.340]  you know you need your brothers and sisters within the force to support
[03:14:36.340 --> 03:14:39.780]  yourselves well it's an issue but there is a there when I was an internal affairs
[03:14:39.780 --> 03:14:44.980]  we had this thing that was called the action desk believe it or not I think
[03:14:44.980 --> 03:14:48.060]  about over half the calls we got were from other police officers making
[03:14:48.060 --> 03:14:51.980]  allegations on police officers doing bad things on the street but let's see
[03:14:51.980 --> 03:14:56.420]  listen Chris this isn't a one-sided argument here okay we're talking about
[03:14:56.420 --> 03:15:01.500]  three different things here all about the police department but facts have got
[03:15:01.500 --> 03:15:05.300]  a matter if we want to make some changes here and what's going on the police
[03:15:05.300 --> 03:15:09.700]  have already recognized the fact that we have some issues that we've got to deal
[03:15:09.700 --> 03:15:14.900]  with all right now the black community has got to also understand that they have
[03:15:14.900 --> 03:15:19.020]  issues that they have to deal with all right this is not a one-way street here
[03:15:19.020 --> 03:15:22.700]  and now you got police officer got the Ferguson fact that we're dealing with
[03:15:22.700 --> 03:15:26.020]  today all right it's because police officers are second-guest right away
[03:15:26.020 --> 03:15:31.380]  we have these the incident in Louisiana and in Minneapolis okay we don't know
[03:15:31.380 --> 03:15:36.060]  what happened there okay especially what happened in Minneapolis right the
[03:15:36.060 --> 03:15:40.060]  investigation is still going on but to come out with the rhetoric that the
[03:15:40.060 --> 03:15:44.660]  police officers were racist when there's no evidence to indicate that racism was
[03:15:44.660 --> 03:15:50.380]  involved that's got has got to stop all right that that doesn't stop and this
[03:15:50.380 --> 03:15:55.060]  thing about the disparity of blacks and whites and jails that's got to stop
[03:15:55.060 --> 03:15:59.220]  because I got statistics right here which will prove me right in New York
[03:15:59.220 --> 03:16:07.140]  City alone okay blacks are 23% they make up 75 right the population 75% of all
[03:16:07.140 --> 03:16:13.060]  shootings 70% of all robberies and 60% of all violent crimes all right the
[03:16:13.060 --> 03:16:19.020]  weights only 3% now that is why there were more blacks in jail than there are
[03:16:19.020 --> 03:16:23.460]  weights that's okay and now let me just finish here and then all right so we
[03:16:23.460 --> 03:16:27.780]  look at that statistic all right they turn it around you know the racial
[03:16:27.780 --> 03:16:31.780]  demagogues out there turn around that the blacks are being picked on it's not
[03:16:31.780 --> 03:16:36.700]  so so the facts in these statistics all right have to be addressed and you
[03:16:36.700 --> 03:16:41.660]  got to understand them but that's Harry hook on CNN debating Mark Lamont Hill
[03:16:41.660 --> 03:16:46.060]  and we've got another clip we might not get chance to play it but he's laying
[03:16:46.060 --> 03:16:50.620]  out the facts that black people are more prone to criminality Mark Lamont Hill
[03:16:50.620 --> 03:16:54.500]  comes back he doesn't try to dispute any of those facts and in fact that's
[03:16:54.500 --> 03:16:59.340]  replicated in a media matters article on this issue of course media matters being
[03:16:59.340 --> 03:17:03.220]  an Obama administration front literally meets with the Obama White House every
[03:17:03.220 --> 03:17:09.460]  week to decide who to attack in the media they can't debate him on the fact
[03:17:09.460 --> 03:17:13.740]  they can't answer the charge that black people are having more violent
[03:17:13.740 --> 03:17:20.140]  confrontations with police because they commit more crimes objective fact we've
[03:17:20.140 --> 03:17:24.820]  been over it again and again so what do they do Mark Lamont Hill comes back and
[03:17:24.820 --> 03:17:27.820]  says I can't believe you're saying black people are more prone to criminality
[03:17:27.820 --> 03:17:31.740]  Harry hook says well they are here are the stats what do you say about the stats
[03:17:31.740 --> 03:17:36.100]  he has nothing to say about the stats what does he have he has the word
[03:17:36.100 --> 03:17:42.700]  racist and that's it he thinks that wins him the debate listen the fact you know
[03:17:42.700 --> 03:17:46.380]  you can ask the question are black people in America more prone to
[03:17:46.380 --> 03:17:51.820]  criminality than white people yes the facts clearly show that does that mean
[03:17:51.820 --> 03:17:57.220]  that all black people are criminals no but that's not the debate you know on
[03:17:57.220 --> 03:18:01.940]  Muslims more prone to violence than Christians yes the facts clearly show
[03:18:01.940 --> 03:18:08.420]  that virtually every terror attack that happens is done by Muslims the facts
[03:18:08.420 --> 03:18:14.660]  clearly show that is it because of race no Islam isn't a race again that's not
[03:18:14.660 --> 03:18:19.540]  the debate but the left has to make it about race they have to ignore the facts
[03:18:19.540 --> 03:18:25.340]  and just label everyone racist to shut down the debate is it about the
[03:18:25.340 --> 03:18:30.140]  pigmentation of someone's skin is it about culture is it about socio-economics
[03:18:30.140 --> 03:18:36.660]  well yes young people young black people their entire subculture is based
[03:18:36.660 --> 03:18:42.380]  around the glorification of criminality this hip hop gangster culture and you've
[03:18:42.380 --> 03:18:46.500]  had black intellectuals who of course are completely panned by the left because
[03:18:46.500 --> 03:18:51.140]  they don't tell the dogma like Thomas Sowell who have come out and documented
[03:18:51.140 --> 03:18:56.140]  this connection between hip hop gangster thug culture and criminality
[03:18:56.140 --> 03:19:01.100]  amongst young black people if that's all they see if that's what they're told to
[03:19:01.100 --> 03:19:05.060]  aspire to and how do you think they're going to behave and then you've got the
[03:19:05.060 --> 03:19:09.900]  entire socio-economic morass which which black people are ensconced in again
[03:19:09.900 --> 03:19:15.020]  it's based around the left keeping black people in the ghetto keeping them
[03:19:15.020 --> 03:19:20.580]  dependent keeping them on welfare keeping them on food stamps in return for
[03:19:20.580 --> 03:19:25.060]  their votes they don't care about black people becoming empowered they don't care
[03:19:25.060 --> 03:19:28.140]  about black people becoming self-sufficient they don't care about
[03:19:28.140 --> 03:19:32.980]  black people becoming independent because all they're interested in is

[03:24:26.940 --> 03:24:33.140]  popular new transgender YouTube commenter commentator she made a video
[03:24:33.140 --> 03:24:38.380]  about black lives matter and was completely harassed targeted doxxed had
[03:24:38.380 --> 03:24:42.740]  her family threatened we're gonna get the full story from Blair why but again
[03:24:42.740 --> 03:24:47.780]  this is a peaceful group CNN told me Sally Kohn told me gonna get more into
[03:24:47.780 --> 03:24:54.740]  that but first migrants rape molest women at anti-racism festival in
[03:24:54.740 --> 03:25:00.500]  Sweden it's our old friends once again the liberal basket case known as Sweden
[03:25:00.500 --> 03:25:06.380]  this is up on info wars dot-com women attending an anti-racism music festival
[03:25:06.380 --> 03:25:10.700]  in Sweden were raped and molested by migrant men in yet another shocking
[03:25:10.700 --> 03:25:17.340]  example of how the West is importing a real rape culture now the police
[03:25:17.340 --> 03:25:21.980]  spokesman came out and said that the culprits surprise surprise were quo
[03:25:21.980 --> 03:25:27.060]  foreign men so you've got all these Swedish love and light hippies at this
[03:25:27.060 --> 03:25:31.620]  music festival this peace and love festival out there to enjoy themselves
[03:25:31.620 --> 03:25:36.620]  these are probably the same people that held up refugees welcome signs and once
[03:25:36.620 --> 03:25:42.260]  again we have a massive rape scandal on our hands a massive molestation scandal
[03:25:42.260 --> 03:25:48.100]  remember last summer in Stockholm the Swedish police were caught covering up
[03:25:48.100 --> 03:25:55.660]  a similar mass molestation it's happened yet again how many times does this have
[03:25:55.660 --> 03:26:02.460]  to happen before feminists say anything about it in fact the organisers of this
[03:26:02.460 --> 03:26:09.140]  anti-racism festival they blamed all men we saw the same thing after Cologne
[03:26:09.140 --> 03:26:14.700]  again hundreds and hundreds of women molested on mass New Year's Eve what did
[03:26:14.700 --> 03:26:19.060]  the local feminist groups do immediately afterwards they came out and blamed
[03:26:19.060 --> 03:26:25.260]  German men when in almost every instance the culprits were either newly
[03:26:25.260 --> 03:26:31.220]  arrived asylum seekers or supposedly integrated assimilated migrants who had
[03:26:31.220 --> 03:26:35.980]  been there for a couple of years this isn't a problem with German men this
[03:26:35.980 --> 03:26:41.060]  isn't a problem with Nordic drinking culture as the Norwegian government came
[03:26:41.060 --> 03:26:46.340]  out and tried to claim after they had a similar mass molestation now during this
[03:26:46.340 --> 03:26:53.060]  incident you actually had a woman raped in the middle of the audience in the
[03:26:53.060 --> 03:26:57.860]  middle of a music concert it's not as if this was happening you know off on the
[03:26:57.860 --> 03:27:03.140]  sidelines behind closed doors right in the middle of this field a woman is
[03:27:03.140 --> 03:27:07.660]  being raped and again according to this police spokesman they used the same
[03:27:07.660 --> 03:27:13.660]  tactics that we saw in Cologne groups of men crowding around women distracting
[03:27:13.660 --> 03:27:19.380]  them while others grope and molest but not just groping and molesting in this
[03:27:19.380 --> 03:27:25.860]  situation actual full-on rape now I looked into the place where this happened
[03:27:25.860 --> 03:27:31.540]  Bolange this is a place that's another one of these Muslim no-go area ghettos
[03:27:31.540 --> 03:27:37.820]  just two months ago police ambulance workers and even shop workers were being
[03:27:37.820 --> 03:27:43.700]  attacked cars were being set on fire this is one of the areas that enjoyed the
[03:27:43.700 --> 03:27:48.740]  bountiful beauties of cultural enrichment since Sweden opened its door
[03:27:48.740 --> 03:27:53.660]  to mass immigration back in the 70s in fact in this article I've linked to the
[03:27:53.660 --> 03:27:58.820]  chart for Bolange this area of Sweden where you can see the crime rate and
[03:27:58.820 --> 03:28:06.180]  since the late 70s it's gone straight up as a result of the bountiful cultural
[03:28:06.180 --> 03:28:11.020]  enrichment that they've received as a result of mass immigration now remember
[03:28:11.020 --> 03:28:15.100]  even the New York Times admitted a couple of days ago even they reported on the
[03:28:15.100 --> 03:28:19.580]  fact if you read the article they admit that most of the culprits at these other
[03:28:19.580 --> 03:28:25.900]  two mass molestation incidents again at music festivals the Brevala Festival and
[03:28:25.900 --> 03:28:30.340]  the Putter Park and music festival in fact John bounded a video about that
[03:28:30.340 --> 03:28:34.620]  which is on the Alex Jones channel again most of the attackers identified as
[03:28:34.620 --> 03:28:42.780]  foreigners we had the president of the German federal crime police office out
[03:28:42.780 --> 03:28:48.380]  of Cologne admit in an article in USA Today yesterday and we featured this as
[03:28:48.380 --> 03:28:51.940]  well quote there is a connection between the emergence of this phenomena and the
[03:28:51.940 --> 03:28:58.860]  rapid migration in 2015 okay that's not Pegida saying that that's not right-wing
[03:28:58.860 --> 03:29:04.260]  racists saying that that's the president of the German federal crime police
[03:29:04.260 --> 03:29:10.220]  finally admitting that this is a problem our feminists going to admit that large
[03:29:10.220 --> 03:29:14.900]  numbers of men coming into the country who treat women as second-class citizens
[03:29:14.900 --> 03:29:20.180]  who treat them as cattle is that are they going to acknowledge that as a
[03:29:20.180 --> 03:29:25.820]  problem or are they going to continue to whine about man-spreading all these
[03:29:25.820 --> 03:29:30.260]  other ridiculous western gyno-centric issues which have nothing to do with the
[03:29:30.260 --> 03:29:36.100]  fact that women are under threat we're importing a real rape culture into the
[03:29:36.100 --> 03:29:42.180]  West and feminists are absolutely silent on it as women are being attacked and
[03:29:42.180 --> 03:29:47.140]  raped over and over again we'll be back on the Alex Jones show with Blair White
[03:29:47.140 --> 03:29:53.380]  don't go away info wars dot com we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex
[03:29:53.380 --> 03:29:57.580]  Jones and the GCN radio network
[03:29:59.420 --> 03:30:04.980]  the Chinese president has ordered the People's Liberation Army to prepare for
[03:30:04.980 --> 03:30:10.420]  combat as a measure against possible hostile US action in the South China
[03:30:10.420 --> 03:30:15.220]  Sea after an international tribunal ruled that Beijing had no exclusive
[03:30:15.220 --> 03:30:20.060]  control over the area the permanent court of arbitration said that there was no
[03:30:20.060 --> 03:30:24.420]  evidence that China had historically exercised exclusive control over the
[03:30:24.420 --> 03:30:29.860]  waters or resources reports the BBC China responded by labeling the ruling
[03:30:29.860 --> 03:30:34.740]  ill-founded and refused to be bound by it however behind the scenes the
[03:30:34.740 --> 03:30:38.980]  Chinese president fears that the US could seize on the ruling to justify
[03:30:38.980 --> 03:30:43.740]  aggressive military maneuvers in the area and has ordered PLA forces to
[03:30:43.740 --> 03:30:48.540]  prepare for war China's Navy has repeatedly issued warnings to US

[03:35:15.340 --> 03:35:20.940]  description now Blair you posted a video about a week ago I think called black
[03:35:20.940 --> 03:35:26.380]  lives matter is trash you went straight out there with it got in people's faces
[03:35:26.380 --> 03:35:30.100]  basically with the truth you know the video talked about and in fact we can
[03:35:30.100 --> 03:35:33.700]  see some of it in the background here you talked about how these black lives
[03:35:33.700 --> 03:35:39.340]  matter morons crashed this vigil to the Orlando massacre victims to reinforce
[03:35:39.340 --> 03:35:43.940]  their oppression olympics hierarchy and then you basically went through the fact
[03:35:43.940 --> 03:35:48.700]  that black lives matter as a movement has completely failed you know we got
[03:35:48.700 --> 03:35:53.420]  race relations the worst in modern history we've got black people still
[03:35:53.420 --> 03:35:58.340]  killing each other in droves now black lives matter the ideology is inspiring
[03:35:58.340 --> 03:36:02.820]  actual terrorists to go out and kill people and of course the big one for me
[03:36:02.820 --> 03:36:08.020]  millions of Americans are now not even interested in police brutality or
[03:36:08.020 --> 03:36:12.940]  addressing it as an issue because of its association with this colossally
[03:36:12.940 --> 03:36:19.020]  stupid violent and divisive black lives matter movement now you put out this
[03:36:19.020 --> 03:36:24.980]  video tell us what was in the video and what happened after you posted it okay
[03:36:24.980 --> 03:36:30.940]  so in the video it was I think it was at Mizzou and it was a black lives matter
[03:36:30.940 --> 03:36:36.060]  activist who hijacked the stage and the microphone to basically advertise the
[03:36:36.060 --> 03:36:40.940]  black lives matter racial demonstrations and say that the people that were there
[03:36:40.940 --> 03:36:47.740]  to mourn the deaths of the 49 people slain in the Orlando shooting were racist
[03:36:47.740 --> 03:36:51.020]  implying that they were unintelligent because they were white and basically
[03:36:51.020 --> 03:36:55.060]  just using it to push her own narrative rather than to be respectful for what it
[03:36:55.060 --> 03:37:00.700]  was which was you know mourning 49 slain people it's pretty amazing and we we
[03:37:00.700 --> 03:37:05.580]  saw the same thing into I think it was Toronto Canada last weekend where they
[03:37:05.580 --> 03:37:10.540]  again they hijacked this gay pride march to reinforce this oppression Olympics I
[03:37:10.540 --> 03:37:14.420]  think there's this fear that you know their control of that narrative of gay
[03:37:14.420 --> 03:37:18.340]  people in general of this LGBT community which you'll remember of is
[03:37:18.340 --> 03:37:23.900]  starting to slip away and those people are being relegated they're being put up
[03:37:23.900 --> 03:37:29.060]  at the bottom of the oppression Olympics hierarchy and they're trying to reinforce
[03:37:29.060 --> 03:37:33.940]  again their supremacy as black lives matter is a divisive supremacist group
[03:37:33.940 --> 03:37:39.060]  above those people because again they're starting to listen to people like you
[03:37:39.060 --> 03:37:44.220]  people like me I mean after all ando I got so many positive messages from gay
[03:37:44.220 --> 03:37:48.420]  people from LGBT people you know saying they were buying guns they were
[03:37:48.420 --> 03:37:51.860]  starting to watch conservative libertarian YouTube videos they were
[03:37:51.860 --> 03:37:55.940]  starting to think about voting for Donald Trump because they're just sick of
[03:37:55.940 --> 03:38:02.060]  being told what to think by the left so you posted this video and then the
[03:38:02.060 --> 03:38:06.340]  peaceful black lives matter group Sally Cohn and CNN told me it was peaceful so I
[03:38:06.340 --> 03:38:11.420]  guess it is they weren't too happy with it tell us what happened afterwards no
[03:38:11.420 --> 03:38:16.580]  you know unlike when I make a video about say feminism where you'll have like
[03:38:16.580 --> 03:38:20.860]  two feminists in the comment sections arguing black lives matter is actually
[03:38:20.860 --> 03:38:24.780]  very organized and if they set a target they're coming for a target and
[03:38:24.780 --> 03:38:29.700]  basically what happened was one prominent Twitter in the black lives matter
[03:38:29.700 --> 03:38:34.300]  I don't know community shared my video and then from there it was just like they
[03:38:34.300 --> 03:38:39.460]  descended which is totally fine because I make videos to encourage you know
[03:38:39.460 --> 03:38:44.980]  discourse and disagreement and everything but no one really challenged the
[03:38:44.980 --> 03:38:49.180]  ideas in my video they just kind of made you know ad hominem attacks and
[03:38:49.180 --> 03:38:54.020]  eventually a Twitter got a hold of me they're a doxing Twitter and on their
[03:38:54.020 --> 03:38:57.580]  timeline they had docs like dozens and dozens of people including their
[03:38:57.580 --> 03:39:02.460]  addresses phone numbers other information employers and we're encouraging
[03:39:02.460 --> 03:39:08.100]  people to actually go to their homes and enact violence upon them so at that
[03:39:08.100 --> 03:39:13.060]  point I decided to kind of go on a social media blackout and I kind of said
[03:39:13.060 --> 03:39:16.740]  because a few of my family members were getting message and I was kind of like
[03:39:16.740 --> 03:39:21.500]  I'll take the heat but my family didn't really sign up to be as public as me so
[03:39:21.500 --> 03:39:25.620]  I did go kind of under and people were saying I was banned I saw that you
[03:39:25.620 --> 03:39:28.860]  tweeted that I was like banned by Twitter which I could see why people will
[03:39:28.860 --> 03:39:32.180]  think that because given the current climate a lot of voices like ours are
[03:39:32.180 --> 03:39:37.620]  being censored but it wasn't the case you had you had to basically deactivate
[03:39:37.620 --> 03:39:41.460]  your Twitter account because these people were posting your address or
[03:39:41.460 --> 03:39:45.020]  trying to get your address trying to get other people to threaten you again we
[03:39:45.020 --> 03:39:49.460]  saw the same thing about a week or two ago with the 16 year old Trump supporter
[03:39:49.460 --> 03:39:53.940]  remember we put out the footage of him basically disagreeing with this stupid
[03:39:53.940 --> 03:39:58.060]  black lives matter supporter who thought that Donald Trump's wife was an illegal
[03:39:58.060 --> 03:40:03.580]  immigrant basically owned him in a debate that guy got some attention on
[03:40:03.580 --> 03:40:09.180]  you know YouTube on Twitter they posted a picture of him at his workplace they
[03:40:09.180 --> 03:40:14.540]  actively tried to encourage other BLM people to go out and harass this 16 year
[03:40:14.540 --> 03:40:19.780]  old black kid simply because he supports Donald Trump so again the point I make
[03:40:19.780 --> 03:40:23.260]  over and over again you know leftists are the most intolerant people in
[03:40:23.260 --> 03:40:27.540]  politics and again while you know while they claim to celebrate and advance the
[03:40:27.540 --> 03:40:33.500]  LGBT community it seems to me that they save their most vicious attacks for
[03:40:33.500 --> 03:40:38.860]  members of the LGBT community who dare to disagree with them so why do you think
[03:40:38.860 --> 03:40:43.780]  yeah go ahead basically what it is is you know black lives matter unless it's a
[03:40:43.780 --> 03:40:47.460]  black person who disagrees with you because I saw a bunch of tweets from
[03:40:47.460 --> 03:40:51.660]  them towards that kid that you guys had on your channel and they were saying they
[03:40:51.660 --> 03:40:55.220]  were gonna kill him beat him up find his workplace find his house it was crazy
[03:40:55.220 --> 03:41:02.020]  and I saw like evidence on the Twitter that was doxing me and others that
[03:41:02.020 --> 03:41:05.700]  people were actually like talking about going to people's homes that's kind of
[03:41:05.700 --> 03:41:10.700]  the main reason why I went under and then the LGBT thing of course like
[03:41:10.700 --> 03:41:16.060]  SJW's claim to care about trans lives trans voices talk about how we're always
[03:41:16.060 --> 03:41:20.980]  silenced but they care when trans people are parroting their agenda they don't
[03:41:20.980 --> 03:41:24.060]  care when trans people have their own opinions with me which may differ from
[03:41:24.060 --> 03:41:28.820]  theirs no exactly I mean look look at what happened with Caitlyn Jenny you
[03:41:28.820 --> 03:41:34.300]  know when she first came out last year she was celebrated as a goddess by the
[03:41:34.300 --> 03:41:39.180]  left they were like bow down to the goddess how dare you even criticize or
[03:41:39.180 --> 03:41:44.220]  critique her lifestyle then she came out you know a few months later a six
[03:41:44.220 --> 03:41:47.820]  months later as quite a vehement conservative she attacked Hillary
[03:41:47.820 --> 03:41:52.540]  Clinton on her own show and then suddenly she wasn't so well liked by the
[03:41:52.540 --> 03:41:58.700]  left correct isn't that funny how like the new thing in 2016 is coming out as
[03:41:58.700 --> 03:42:02.620]  a conservative or coming out is not being progressive when it used to be like
[03:42:02.620 --> 03:42:06.660]  coming out of strands or coming out as gay I just think it's funny I've had so
[03:42:06.660 --> 03:42:12.740]  many people message me saying that they are either LGBT or just anyone and they
[03:42:12.740 --> 03:42:16.020]  are so uncomfortable to share their political views or their social views
[03:42:16.020 --> 03:42:19.900]  because they'll lose their job and I don't really blame them you know like
[03:42:19.900 --> 03:42:23.460]  there's a small number of us that are actually willing to be on the internet
[03:42:23.460 --> 03:42:28.140]  and be super open and use our names and show our faces because it actually is
[03:42:28.140 --> 03:42:33.820]  kind of risky no it is I mean and it's the same with Brexit here in the United
[03:42:33.820 --> 03:42:38.260]  Kingdom and especially London I mean I went to a like a Brexit drinks party a
[03:42:38.260 --> 03:42:43.020]  couple of weeks ago and everyone there said I'm afraid to tell anyone that I
[03:42:43.020 --> 03:42:47.140]  voted for Brexit because I might get fired because I might get socially
[03:42:47.140 --> 03:42:51.620]  ostracised and again why is that why can't conservatives be comfortable in
[03:42:51.620 --> 03:42:55.780]  their political views well it's because leftists are intolerant and they will
[03:42:55.780 --> 03:43:01.300]  gang up in groups to publicly shame people to get them fired and again in
[03:43:01.300 --> 03:43:04.420]  some cases with the more violent extremist elements of Black Lives
[03:43:04.420 --> 03:43:09.660]  Matter actually threatened to go out and target people harassed them violently
[03:43:09.660 --> 03:43:13.580]  in their own homes so again it underscores the fact that the left is
[03:43:13.580 --> 03:43:18.540]  completely intolerant absolutely and I think like one of the main criticisms
[03:43:18.540 --> 03:43:23.780]  I got of my video from BLM was that of course that I was racist I was speaking
[03:43:23.780 --> 03:43:26.900]  against black people I think it's interesting that there's this conflation
[03:43:26.900 --> 03:43:30.980]  of black people and Black Lives Matter when in reality there's a lot of people
[03:43:30.980 --> 03:43:33.820]  of all races within within the movement of course there's a lot of black people
[03:43:33.820 --> 03:43:39.260]  but it like I was looking at the news story of all those protesters that were
[03:43:39.260 --> 03:43:42.780]  arrested who were blocking traffic I think it was on like I-49 or something
[03:43:42.780 --> 03:43:46.460]  forgive me if that number is wrong but and they were all white that were
[03:43:46.460 --> 03:43:52.140]  arrested so that tells you possibly two things right it tells you that first of
[03:43:52.140 --> 03:43:55.380]  all criticizing Black Lives Matter is not inherently criticizing black people
[03:43:55.380 --> 03:43:58.300]  because it's full of white people in the movement as well and then it also kind
[03:43:58.300 --> 03:44:04.060]  of shows that the police right now are scared to arrest black people if all the
[03:44:04.060 --> 03:44:06.540]  protesters that were arrested literally every single one I think there was like
[03:44:06.540 --> 03:44:09.740]  25 or 30 were white.
[03:44:09.740 --> 03:44:14.860]  Now that's the point Black Lives Matter is an ideology it's not a race that's
[03:44:14.860 --> 03:44:18.660]  like saying if you criticize feminism then you hate women feminism is not a
[03:44:18.660 --> 03:44:23.500]  gender okay you've got the Washington Times reporting today black Vanderbilt
[03:44:23.500 --> 03:44:28.140]  professor says Black Lives Matter movement is pure Marxism okay this is a
[03:44:28.140 --> 03:44:33.780]  black female professor criticizing Black Lives Matter is she racist you have the
[03:44:33.780 --> 03:44:37.700]  black Harvard economist who did this study which found that there was no
[03:44:37.700 --> 03:44:41.700]  racial bias in officer-involved shootings and in fact if you look at
[03:44:41.700 --> 03:44:46.460]  Houston he found that black people were 20% less likely to get shot by cops
[03:44:46.460 --> 03:44:52.620]  compared to white people again black Harvard economist is he racist for
[03:44:52.620 --> 03:44:57.020]  coming out with a study that counters the Black Lives Matter narrative again
[03:44:57.020 --> 03:45:02.260]  BLM is not a race it's an ideology ideologies are not immune from
[03:45:02.260 --> 03:45:07.660]  criticism and calling somebody a racist isn't an argument it's not a rebuttal
[03:45:07.660 --> 03:45:11.500]  now I wanted to ask you here we got about five minutes left there's also this
[03:45:11.500 --> 03:45:16.780]  youtuber I believe who attacked you in a video called Onision basically this is
[03:45:16.780 --> 03:45:21.260]  the guy who makes videos claiming that feminism is about gender equality because
[03:45:21.260 --> 03:45:25.900]  that's what the dictionary definition says when of course we know that modern
[03:45:25.900 --> 03:45:29.420]  feminism is actually this you know leftist supremacist hate movement that
[03:45:29.420 --> 03:45:33.700]  has nothing whatsoever to do with equality but he has got a pretty
[03:45:33.700 --> 03:45:38.900]  substantial YouTube audience which mainly consists of 15 year old girls in
[03:45:38.900 --> 03:45:43.140]  fact he had a poll on his Twitter in which he asked how old his audience was
[03:45:43.140 --> 03:45:47.980]  and most of them were you know 14 to 17 years old but again that's quite a
[03:45:47.980 --> 03:45:53.260]  sizable mob he did a video attacking you and again your your accounts got
[03:45:53.260 --> 03:46:00.260]  flooded with harassment is that correct yeah but you know I'm number one to be
[03:46:00.260 --> 03:46:04.100]  like oh people are harassing me it's not really that first of all the hate mob
[03:46:04.100 --> 03:46:10.340]  was 13 year old so I was I was not really affected but I think that's all
[03:46:10.340 --> 03:46:14.300]  you that's all you really need to know about them is that they're all you know
[03:46:14.300 --> 03:46:20.660]  little kids his video was it attacking me not necessarily I made a response video
[03:46:20.660 --> 03:46:24.060]  to him first what he made an original video talking about feminism which was
[03:46:24.060 --> 03:46:28.300]  the stupidest thing on the planet and so I made a video rebutting that one he
[03:46:28.300 --> 03:46:33.220]  made another video two days ago in which he was he didn't respond to a single one
[03:46:33.220 --> 03:46:36.180]  of my points about feminism he just responded to like the jokes and I made
[03:46:36.180 --> 03:46:41.860]  which was stupid so it kind of did just add on that like the same day that black
[03:46:41.860 --> 03:46:45.980]  lives matter was descending upon me all of these 13 year olds of an easy on
[03:46:45.980 --> 03:46:50.420]  word to you but again I wasn't really even thinking about the Anise on fans it
[03:46:50.420 --> 03:46:56.140]  was more the black lives matter people who were actually you know potentially
[03:46:56.140 --> 03:47:00.540]  the most extreme exactly but again it's a peaceful group while they're you know
[03:47:00.540 --> 03:47:03.940]  shooting at officers houses and dropping concrete blocks on their head
[03:47:03.940 --> 03:47:08.580]  they're completely peaceful Sally Cone told me CNN told me now I want to switch
[03:47:08.580 --> 03:47:12.580]  gears we've got a few minutes left but transgender bathrooms you know we had the
[03:47:12.580 --> 03:47:18.140]  big massive months long debate about the North Carolina bathroom bill given
[03:47:18.140 --> 03:47:23.900]  that transgender people make up about 0.3% of the population and I don't
[03:47:23.900 --> 03:47:27.340]  really know your take on this but they make up such a small minority of the
[03:47:27.340 --> 03:47:32.180]  population why is there such a huge debate over this why is it even an issue
[03:47:32.180 --> 03:47:36.460]  why do you think the left is pushing this well what you're seeing is the
[03:47:36.460 --> 03:47:41.380]  politicization of transgenderism which is so interesting to me and it's
[03:47:41.380 --> 03:47:44.700]  actually one of the main reasons why I started my channel because I saw what
[03:47:44.700 --> 03:47:48.740]  was once in my mind just a medical diagnosis suddenly turned into a social
[03:47:48.740 --> 03:47:54.500]  justice cause and into you know this political game and as far as the
[03:47:54.500 --> 03:47:58.860]  bathrooms go part of me wishes we could just go back to the days where people
[03:47:58.860 --> 03:48:02.340]  didn't know what in the world being trans was because trans people have been
[03:48:02.340 --> 03:48:08.700]  you know using their restrooms for as long as they've been around I think that
[03:48:08.700 --> 03:48:12.940]  both sides were kind of dumb on that issue I think that on one side there was
[03:48:12.940 --> 03:48:17.740]  definitely some rape hysteria coming from the super far right and on the left
[03:48:17.740 --> 03:48:21.980]  on the left hand side there was basically like really weird pushes for
[03:48:21.980 --> 03:48:25.660]  like gender neutral bathrooms which most trans people don't even want most
[03:48:25.660 --> 03:48:29.620]  trans people just identify as one or the other they don't identify as genderless
[03:48:29.620 --> 03:48:35.900]  and something in between so to me it was just a big a big cluster f of things
[03:48:35.900 --> 03:48:40.620]  that I didn't even have too strong of an opinion on either way so again it's
[03:48:40.620 --> 03:48:46.300]  it's the left kind of appropriating the narrative from transgender people and
[03:48:46.300 --> 03:48:50.300]  then again using them to go after people who they disagree with politically the
[03:48:50.300 --> 03:48:55.620]  point I made was that if somebody wants to identify as a woman then make the
[03:48:55.620 --> 03:49:00.820]  effort to identify as a woman I mean you could go in a woman's bathroom at any
[03:49:00.820 --> 03:49:04.780]  point nobody would bat an eyelid I think the problem lies with the people who
[03:49:04.780 --> 03:49:09.740]  just you know wishy-washy identify as different people from one day to the
[03:49:09.740 --> 03:49:14.660]  next and that's that's when it becomes a problem right yeah and I think that's
[03:49:14.660 --> 03:49:18.660]  the difference between what I call the tumbler eyes the trans trenders and like
[03:49:18.660 --> 03:49:23.140]  actual trans people who have had a medical diagnosis and are doing the best
[03:49:23.140 --> 03:49:26.540]  with their situation and the truth is like you said if you do make an effort
[03:49:26.540 --> 03:49:31.180]  you should be fine but it's the people who like you said willy-nilly want to go
[03:49:31.180 --> 03:49:34.540]  back and forth or say that they're a third gender or whatever those people
[03:49:34.540 --> 03:49:38.300]  actually they're co-opting what trans is and they're actually making it harder
[03:49:38.300 --> 03:49:41.540]  for actual trans people but again we're such a small percentage of the
[03:49:41.540 --> 03:49:46.220]  population I've never been one to expect some huge dramatic social chains to
[03:49:46.220 --> 03:49:51.940]  accommodate such a small group yeah exactly now we're coming up against the
[03:49:51.940 --> 03:49:55.980]  break so in the final minute Blair just tell people how they can find your

[03:54:48.500 --> 03:54:53.220]  has just appended the conventional wisdom on police shootings there is no
[03:54:53.220 --> 03:54:56.540]  racial bias when officers fire on suspects according to a new study by
[03:54:56.540 --> 03:55:02.900]  professor Roland Friar black suspects are actually less likely to be shot than
[03:55:02.900 --> 03:55:09.220]  other suspects what do you think about that Mark Lamont Hill facts don't care

[03:55:24.980 --> 03:55:30.340]  in Houston were about 20% less likely to shoot a suspect if the suspect was
[03:55:30.340 --> 03:55:37.300]  black says the study conducted by a black Harvard economist he must be a
[03:55:37.300 --> 03:55:42.220]  racist now there's still no justice for the people in Idaho this is out of
[03:55:42.220 --> 03:55:48.940]  world net daily mom of Idaho rape victim we're being treated as criminals this is
[03:55:48.940 --> 03:55:53.380]  more than a month after her five-year-old daughter was allegedly raped by
[03:55:53.380 --> 03:55:58.460]  child refugee from Iraq Lanley Shelley of Twin Falls Idaho says her little girl is
[03:55:58.460 --> 03:56:01.820]  still traumatized by the incident while local authorities have denied her
[03:56:01.820 --> 03:56:07.220]  access to basic documents such as the 911 transcripts police and medical
[03:56:07.220 --> 03:56:11.740]  reports so you remember the video a few weeks ago we had the local residents
[03:56:11.740 --> 03:56:16.860]  in front of the town council absolutely furious that they were getting no answers
[03:56:16.860 --> 03:56:23.300]  on this and now the victims are being stopped from getting answers from getting
[03:56:23.300 --> 03:56:29.060]  transcripts in the effort to get justice there's something absolutely rotten
[03:56:29.060 --> 03:56:33.500]  going on in the town of Twin Falls Idaho so we're going to continue to keep on
[03:56:33.500 --> 03:56:38.100]  top of that story business insider reports the government may have broken the
[03:56:38.100 --> 03:56:42.260]  law with the EU referendum the government failed to follow its own rules in
[03:56:42.260 --> 03:56:45.500]  the way it ran the brexit referendum according to a leading constitutional
[03:56:45.500 --> 03:56:48.820]  expert who said he agrees with a prominent you're a skeptic lawyer who
[03:56:48.820 --> 03:56:52.700]  raised the same point in the House of Commons basically what's going on is
[03:56:52.700 --> 03:56:58.780]  they're trying to argue that because the government fear mongering on brexit
[03:56:58.780 --> 03:57:04.300]  wasn't successful and that the majority of people voted for leave that that
[03:57:04.300 --> 03:57:10.180]  means the referendum should be run again absolutely ridiculous and this is
[03:57:10.180 --> 03:57:14.580]  coming out the same this is the same argument from people who say that I had
[03:57:14.580 --> 03:57:18.460]  an argument with someone on Facebook today who said you're anti-democratic for
[03:57:18.460 --> 03:57:23.140]  refusing to support a second referendum okay so this is somebody who wants to
[03:57:23.140 --> 03:57:28.620]  ignore a null and cancel the democratic will of the British people in the biggest
[03:57:28.620 --> 03:57:33.500]  turnout for a vote on anything for decades they want to annul that they
[03:57:33.500 --> 03:57:38.500]  want to cancel that they want to have as many referendums as is necessary until
[03:57:38.500 --> 03:57:43.220]  they get the result they want and yet they have the temerity they have the
[03:57:43.220 --> 03:57:49.220]  nerve to call me anti-democratic this is how these people operate now we've got
[03:57:49.220 --> 03:57:53.660]  the Sun reporting psychiatrists reveal alarming rise in number of patients
[03:57:53.660 --> 03:57:58.580]  seeking help for brexit and get anxiety concerns psychiatrists that have been
[03:57:58.580 --> 03:58:03.060]  deluged with patients seeking help for brexit and anxiety since the vote to
[03:58:03.060 --> 03:58:08.140]  ditch the EU so all the little safe space triglypops are just melting down and
[03:58:08.140 --> 03:58:12.540]  crying because they lost the vote and they're out on the streets trying to
[03:58:12.540 --> 03:58:17.940]  annul the democratic will of the British people in the name of love when in
[03:58:17.940 --> 03:58:22.740]  fact they're authoritarian they're anti-democratic everything about them
[03:58:22.740 --> 03:58:29.060]  should be rejected and yes we are going to brexit you've lost deal with it get
[03:58:29.060 --> 03:58:33.140]  over it that's gonna wrap it up for the Alex Jones show Alex will be back 11
