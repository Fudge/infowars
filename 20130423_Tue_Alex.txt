[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:20.800]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.800 --> 00:35.600]  it is Tuesday the 23rd day of April 2013 I am your host Alex Jones and we're going
[00:35.600 --> 00:42.280]  to be live here and Lord's willing three hours well where to start you know
[00:42.280 --> 00:47.600]  globally they're pushing for national and global internet sales taxes and also
[00:47.600 --> 00:53.480]  money transfer taxes basically any type of online activity taxes which also
[00:53.480 --> 00:58.880]  doubles as surveillance and the IRS already says it's the regulations that
[00:58.880 --> 01:02.680]  you're supposed to report to them every online transaction you make and you're
[01:02.680 --> 01:06.880]  supposed to report all your medical records and whether you have insurance
[01:06.880 --> 01:12.760]  or not to the IRS it used to be the grand controller of everything you do with
[01:12.760 --> 01:17.520]  the Fifth Amendment in the ash heap of history and now internet sales tax
[01:17.520 --> 01:22.760]  advances after Obama endorsement notice suddenly they pass CISPA in the house
[01:22.760 --> 01:29.160]  internet tracking taxing control system hundreds of billions of dollars to big
[01:29.160 --> 01:33.120]  defense contractors to spy on you and your family we're talking you know 10
[01:33.120 --> 01:38.680]  million contracts to 10 billion dollar contracts per company with just dozens
[01:38.680 --> 01:43.400]  and dozens of them getting 2 billion 15 billion 10 billion just off the chart
[01:43.400 --> 01:49.960]  gang raping so you pay to be gang raped and now they want the feds to basically
[01:49.960 --> 01:56.520]  administer the delivery of sales tax to the states and of course administrative
[01:56.520 --> 02:03.760]  fees for the feds this is absolutely unbelievable but it's what you of course
[02:03.760 --> 02:09.280]  have to expect and they try to play off small businesses against people saying
[02:09.280 --> 02:13.080]  oh well brick and mortar is in trouble because of this no brick and mortar is
[02:13.080 --> 02:18.880]  in trouble because of the fact that America's been deindustrialized and the
[02:18.880 --> 02:26.080]  economy is being turned off and brick and mortar is in trouble because of the
[02:26.080 --> 02:30.880]  fact that they haven't been competitive that's the issue brick and mortar that
[02:30.880 --> 02:35.760]  is competitive is very very successful look at Apple stores with their brick
[02:35.760 --> 02:38.840]  and mortar and bringing in the slave goods people want to go in they want to
[02:38.840 --> 02:42.640]  talk they want to find out there's special deals when you go in there's all
[02:42.640 --> 02:45.880]  sorts of other little mom and pop operations that are successful because
[02:45.880 --> 02:51.080]  of one word service but this is the classic thing like they did back in the
[02:51.080 --> 02:55.920]  20s these trucks are driving on roads you pay for and they're commercial they're
[02:55.920 --> 03:00.480]  making money let's come up with drivers license commercial license and tax them
[03:00.480 --> 03:03.960]  to drive because they're making money off you know what you pay for those truck
[03:03.960 --> 03:08.040]  drivers pay taxes to those companies pay taxes to you just end up paying in the
[03:08.040 --> 03:12.000]  price of the goods for the taxes they've got to pay and then they extend
[03:12.000 --> 03:17.320]  driving as a privilege which it's not on to everybody else and hence the fraud
[03:17.320 --> 03:22.320]  of drivers licensed by the 50s that are paper licenses and now biometric
[03:22.320 --> 03:28.960]  national ID cards so we're gonna be going over all of that today and then of
[03:28.960 --> 03:33.440]  course the big news it's up at drudgereport.com in the middle column it
[03:33.440 --> 03:40.920]  is a Steve Watson article Boston residents ordered out of their homes at
[03:40.920 --> 03:46.880]  gunpoint by SWAT teams and we have the photos and videos effect I've had Kurt
[03:46.880 --> 03:51.520]  Nemo add some photos or he's adding them right now of that that citizens took and
[03:51.520 --> 03:58.440]  sent us of police and military pointing guns at people in their front yards and
[03:58.440 --> 04:02.480]  in their windows and a you know taking women out of the houses and then the
[04:02.480 --> 04:07.080]  woman puts her hands down so they push her or shove her there's video of that
[04:07.080 --> 04:11.560]  and Bloomberg is coming out saying this is the new way we've got to get rid of
[04:11.560 --> 04:21.320]  the Constitution but it's official the Wall Street Journal declares the USA to
[04:21.320 --> 04:27.400]  be a battlefield and that means martial law suspending your due process for the

[04:42.360 --> 04:47.160]  the suspension of rights this one on citywide Bloomberg says interpretation
[04:47.160 --> 04:50.040]  of Constitution will have to change after Boston bombing see it's not just the
[04:50.040 --> 04:54.360]  Second Amendment he wants he wants it all we're gonna be breaking of that down

[06:58.640 --> 07:04.120]  on Facebook. A little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why
[07:04.120 --> 07:08.080]  even if I had a pretty good size meal that I was still starving and my research
[07:08.080 --> 07:12.560]  led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on
[07:12.560 --> 07:15.800]  here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost
[07:15.800 --> 07:20.960]  completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that
[07:20.960 --> 07:25.600]  our bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be healthy. I then
[07:25.600 --> 07:30.400]  searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered

[08:09.600 --> 08:17.520]  radio network. Ladies and gentlemen there are a lot of questions swirling
[08:17.520 --> 08:26.720]  around the tragic Boston bombings of eight nine days ago last Monday. Monday
[08:26.720 --> 08:32.120]  before this Monday. But what we know undoubtedly is that the power structure
[08:32.120 --> 08:38.560]  and the propaganda media is seizing on this basically foaming at the mouth
[08:38.560 --> 08:43.580]  saying you've got to give up all your rights the entire bill of rights no first
[08:43.580 --> 08:48.800]  amendment no second no fourth no fifth no tenth cameras microphones street
[08:48.800 --> 08:56.600]  lights listening to you and watching you checkpoints everywhere entire cities
[08:56.600 --> 09:02.280]  must be ordered to be on lockdown anytime there's a gunman anywhere every
[09:02.280 --> 09:07.560]  city needs tens of millions of dollars worth of bomb detecting and destroying
[09:07.560 --> 09:15.200]  robots warrantless searches just tens of billions to be spent on more high tech
[09:15.200 --> 09:24.760]  cameras on and on Bloomberg and King and McCain are all in the news saying we
[09:24.760 --> 09:29.440]  have got to basically abolish the bill of rights and the Constitution
[09:29.440 --> 09:37.260]  meanwhile 520 plus people were shot and killed many of them innocents by gang
[09:37.260 --> 09:44.640]  bangers in Chicago in Chicago just in 2012 and they're set to break that
[09:44.640 --> 09:50.280]  number this year in a city where they've taken all of the citizens guns a great
[09:50.280 --> 09:57.520]  old American city of Chicago we're on the radio on 15 30 a.m. and you look at
[09:57.520 --> 10:01.360]  everywhere else with crime off the chart it's where guns are highly restricted
[10:01.360 --> 10:10.280]  like Boston like New York like Detroit like Los Angeles look at look at cities
[10:10.280 --> 10:14.560]  in Connecticut where they have a very strong gun control laws and you look at
[10:14.560 --> 10:18.480]  areas with almost no gun control lower crime rates and I know we've talked
[10:18.480 --> 10:24.040]  about this at nauseam but the system is engaged in a cold-blooded power trip a
[10:24.040 --> 10:31.080]  cold-blooded power grab because they get hundreds of billions of dollars a
[10:31.080 --> 10:36.400]  year in fact guys pull up the 2012 budget for homeland security if memory
[10:36.400 --> 10:40.800]  serves one part of it was 84 billion and then it was supplemental of another 60
[10:40.800 --> 10:45.040]  billion and then other funding just to the anti-terrorism part mind you not
[10:45.040 --> 10:49.600]  the other agencies there's 37 agencies under it but the last number I saw was
[10:49.600 --> 10:56.000]  over 200 billion dollars a year and and a few months ago and Aaron Dykes wrote
[10:56.000 --> 11:01.280]  about this big sis came out and she said in the press conference she said you
[11:01.280 --> 11:06.120]  will not cut our funding it was a cut in the growth of it of more than 10% a year
[11:06.120 --> 11:11.560]  or there will be more terror attacks now let me ask you is there a motive to let
[11:11.560 --> 11:18.360]  terrorism happen or provocateur terrorism or stage terrorism to get 200
[11:18.360 --> 11:25.040]  billion dollars a year domestically and that's what this is you go to college
[11:25.040 --> 11:29.400]  now it's all about scholarships and homeland security data mining how to
[11:29.400 --> 11:35.000]  spy how to profile hey how about we profile the out-of-control kleptocratic
[11:35.000 --> 11:45.680]  government how about we look at those groups the budget request was 57
[11:45.680 --> 11:54.160]  billion and they got 47.4 but that's just for the overall office of DHS not
[11:54.160 --> 11:59.000]  for the 37 agencies if you count all the money quote law enforcement agencies
[11:59.000 --> 12:03.800]  or quasi law enforcement homeland security agencies that I think it's about
[12:03.800 --> 12:10.880]  10 of the 30 plus agencies it's over 200 billion dollars and now under cyber
[12:10.880 --> 12:16.520]  security they're talking about a budget for cyber security over 50 billion
[12:16.520 --> 12:20.800]  dollars a year and they're talking about every four years when they get
[12:20.800 --> 12:25.960]  budgetary you know oversight and then refund it how much the FAA is funded in
[12:25.960 --> 12:35.240]  four-year spurts they're talking about over again 200 billion dollars so we're
[12:35.240 --> 12:38.640]  talking about hundreds of billions of dollars it's like the Pentagon budget is
[12:38.640 --> 12:43.960]  1.1 trillion a year guys check that pull up Pentagon budget but then they have
[12:43.960 --> 12:48.800]  supplemental that's over 800 billion a year and that's not even counting black
[12:48.800 --> 12:56.120]  funding secret funding which is estimated to be 50 to 100 billion no one
[12:56.120 --> 12:59.360]  really knows they use narcotics traffic you name it global narcotics traffic
[12:59.360 --> 13:06.880]  into the US is 500 billion total global narcotics profits are estimated to be
[13:06.880 --> 13:10.280]  well over a trillion dollars and you heard it right the United States is
[13:10.280 --> 13:17.920]  almost half the world market any legal drugs and I tell you the government had
[13:17.920 --> 13:22.480]  a great strategy to make drugs illegal hype them up as cool with Hollywood put
[13:22.480 --> 13:29.280]  a lot of money into it so it's seen as avant-garde and nouveau riche and and you
[13:29.280 --> 13:33.240]  know a get-rich quick scheme
[13:34.560 --> 13:39.120]  yeah look at that article from the Center for Strategic Budgetary Assessments
[13:39.120 --> 13:45.000]  it says the DOD includes a 553 billion dollars in discretionary funding five
[13:45.000 --> 13:49.080]  million in mandatory funding additional 118 billion requested wars in
[13:49.080 --> 13:54.120]  Afghanistan by the way that again these are whitewash numbers if you pull up
[13:54.120 --> 13:58.320]  the numbers it's it's it's it's almost two trillion some years and I tell you
[13:58.320 --> 14:02.000]  these numbers we're getting from government sites are absolute crud because
[14:02.000 --> 14:04.840]  I've I mean I've seen them break down the numbers in Congress when we talk
[14:04.840 --> 14:08.920]  about the real the real cost of the entire thing in fact watch this watch
[14:08.920 --> 14:18.440]  this Pentagon budget over one trillion watch this Pentagon budget over one
[14:18.440 --> 14:23.200]  trillion and then you learn it's actually over that
[14:24.400 --> 14:29.840]  one trillion Pentagon budget cut is possible but not wise now that's a
[14:29.840 --> 14:37.920]  decade-long cut defense two trillion divides Obama and Romney
[14:37.920 --> 14:44.520]  defense spending to spike 2.1 trillion under Romney 1.2 trillion for
[14:44.520 --> 14:47.920]  national security there it is
[14:49.400 --> 14:55.800]  unbelievable the point is is that they reported on two trillion missing two
[14:55.800 --> 15:04.360]  days before 9-11 watch this two trillion missing Pentagon
[15:04.360 --> 15:11.680]  look at this go ahead and watch this up for me guys CBS News 2.3 trillion
[15:11.680 --> 15:16.720]  missing from Pentagon so I'm sorry it's 2.3 trillion that's the type of stuff
[15:16.720 --> 15:21.520]  that we're talking about here and that's why they want this takeover now let me
[15:21.520 --> 15:27.240]  just stop here and reset on air so I can calmly attempt to go over all of this
[15:27.240 --> 15:34.680]  today let me tell you some of the news that I'm going to be breaking down here
[15:34.680 --> 15:44.280]  number one they are using the events of 9-11 to radically re-engineer the
[15:44.280 --> 15:48.160]  society and despite all the basic liberties and freedoms that have been
[15:48.160 --> 15:56.280]  overrun butchered attack dismantled decimated fire bombed by the criminals
[15:56.280 --> 15:59.960]  that have invaded the country who want to be above the law under globalism and
[15:59.960 --> 16:07.080]  want to tie us down with bureaucratic tyranny classical tyranny in our face
[16:07.080 --> 16:12.680]  it did not keep us safe you notice that we're in debt the country's going bankrupt
[16:12.680 --> 16:18.760]  we're hated worldwide over a million Iraqis are dead six seven thousand US
[16:18.760 --> 16:23.640]  troops just from combat injuries that's a conservative number tens of
[16:23.640 --> 16:30.840]  thousands more committed suicide all of this going on in this psychopathic
[16:30.840 --> 16:38.400]  globalist push for world domination and now you have 400 troops 2000 police down
[16:38.400 --> 16:42.680]  there at the Boston Marathon searching people's bags you name it a drill going
[16:42.680 --> 16:48.400]  on right where the bomb happens and it did not stop the terrorist attack that
[16:48.400 --> 16:53.760]  killed three people and injured a hundred that you would think was the end of
[16:53.760 --> 16:58.480]  the world I mean they're having bomb scares in hundreds of cities and towns
[16:58.480 --> 17:03.080]  total panic if a box blows out of the back of a truck you know that in Phoenix

[17:08.320 --> 17:12.600]  everyone to evacuate and if you don't evacuate they come to your house and drag
[17:12.600 --> 17:17.080]  you out by your hair and point guns at you and I saw on CNN a woman who lived

[24:06.480 --> 24:13.360]  by the way at the bottom of the second hour coming up I am going to try to do a
[24:13.360 --> 24:22.760]  basic review just off some notes I wrote last night of the new Tom Cruise film
[24:22.760 --> 24:28.400]  oblivion and I'm just going to say this now I'm not a big Tom Cruise fan I like
[24:28.400 --> 24:31.640]  some of his earlier work I have to know a lot of behind-the-scenes stuff about
[24:31.640 --> 24:35.800]  Tom Cruise because he lived with the Sheen family when he was first making it
[24:35.800 --> 24:40.400]  big for about a year he was best friends with Emilio Estevez so I don't
[24:40.400 --> 24:48.880]  particularly think he's a very nice person but separating Tom Cruise by the
[24:48.880 --> 24:54.200]  way this is one of his best roles this movie is an anti-aluminati tour
[24:54.200 --> 25:01.320]  give force in fact this is better than 2001 Space Odyssey I mean I mean they've
[25:01.320 --> 25:05.920]  got some some some action scenes that are pretty good for the general dumb down
[25:05.920 --> 25:10.240]  public but I literally my dad said yeah I went with my dad last night
[25:10.240 --> 25:18.880]  and he said he said yeah you know I don't usually listen to reviews but I
[25:18.880 --> 25:22.960]  almost didn't want to go see it till you asked me because all the reviews said
[25:22.960 --> 25:28.120]  that no one could understand it and the plot didn't make sense and it basically
[25:28.120 --> 25:33.200]  got bad reviews and I went and saw the movie and no wonder it got bad reviews
[25:33.200 --> 25:40.840]  my mouth was hanging open hanging open because let me tell you something these
[25:40.840 --> 25:48.160]  these the director and his co-writer Joseph Kozinski and Arvid Nelson I
[25:48.160 --> 25:51.840]  want to get these guys on the show no wonder they came from nowhere and wrote
[25:51.840 --> 26:00.440]  this and I got this movie made because this film is a Rosetta stone of what
[26:00.440 --> 26:08.480]  the illuminati is actually planning my mouth was hear the words hanging open
[26:08.480 --> 26:12.600]  during this because this is actually what rakers well and all of them think
[26:12.600 --> 26:17.680]  they're going to do from their own writings and listen this is not a pro
[26:17.680 --> 26:24.400]  illuminati revelation of the method externalization of the hierarchy this
[26:24.400 --> 26:35.400]  is a anti-illuminati anti-death cult anti-technocracy anti-transhumanist film
[26:35.400 --> 26:42.280]  anti-technocratic it's actually got a it's more of the pro the vein of perhaps
[26:42.280 --> 26:46.920]  the transhumanist from a genetic perspective but a spiritual genetics
[26:46.920 --> 26:55.920]  dealing with things like ancestral memories things like that and and again
[26:55.920 --> 27:00.080]  I don't think of myself as that smart Sam already doing the review right now I
[27:00.080 --> 27:03.640]  don't think of myself as that smart and then I just don't get why other people
[27:03.640 --> 27:07.280]  don't get basic stuff it's like one time I sent a tweet out of the Sun in the
[27:07.280 --> 27:10.840]  clouds and I said who said the stars only come out at night and all these
[27:10.840 --> 27:15.320]  people commented on it and no one got what I was saying like what is this I
[27:15.320 --> 27:21.040]  mean there's the Sun it's a star who says the stars only come out at night you
[27:21.040 --> 27:25.800]  know the darker it gets the more you can see the stars I just don't understand
[27:25.800 --> 27:32.400]  how no one understands what this movie is talking about every 10 seconds it's
[27:32.400 --> 27:38.680]  got archetypal messages and all of them are positive now who knows if we've
[27:38.680 --> 27:42.000]  really got a soul but if we do have souls it's when we love each other that's
[27:42.000 --> 27:49.840]  what makes our souls and then it's the opposite with the it is it is really
[27:49.840 --> 27:55.240]  an amazing film and if you separate out the ending of the movie and replace it
[27:55.240 --> 27:58.920]  with the Illuminati who are not really illuminating they're bringing total
[27:58.920 --> 28:04.720]  death then you've got basically their program and their plan and these guys
[28:04.720 --> 28:09.720]  are definitely listeners I would bet money but beyond that because I haven't
[28:09.720 --> 28:14.520]  even really broken all of this down I mean you see oblivion and it's the
[28:14.520 --> 28:20.240]  choice do you want the oblivion of the cold-blooded psychopath or do you want
[28:20.240 --> 28:26.800]  love I mean that's basically what it gets into and and you know obviously the
[28:26.800 --> 28:30.360]  film's already been spoiled for people I don't think it spoils it talk about it
[28:30.360 --> 28:33.760]  but at the bottom of the next hour I'll try to just go over the basics actually
[28:33.760 --> 28:38.240]  after the movie recorded some comments I've got to write down so that I go
[28:38.240 --> 28:43.040]  over all the points but I saw I got home about 10 30 last night gotten about 11
[28:43.040 --> 28:48.720]  sat there with my iPad for about an hour reading reviews and couldn't find one
[28:48.720 --> 28:54.480]  positive review basically or even the positive ones were tongue-in-cheek and
[28:54.480 --> 28:58.760]  like oh yeah it's got great visuals but I'm sick of Tom Cruise and I don't quite
[28:58.760 --> 29:08.120]  understand it and it just goes on and on and on and on and I think Tom Cruise
[29:08.120 --> 29:12.600]  did a great job in the film people say you have such a flat effect in it well
[29:12.600 --> 29:16.920]  yeah of course they have a flat effect and and the movie is all about
[29:16.920 --> 29:21.960]  compartmentalization and how it's a prison I mean I'm telling you see the
[29:21.960 --> 29:26.080]  reason I've got to spoil the whole film is because people aren't getting it so
[29:26.080 --> 29:32.440]  I'm going to do the film a favor today or tomorrow I'm going to shoot a breakdown
[29:32.440 --> 29:35.840]  and then show all of what I'm talking about I may have to go back and see the
[29:35.840 --> 29:39.040]  movie tonight and sneak a bunch of still shots in it to be able to really show
[29:39.040 --> 29:42.720]  you there's a lot of the films not even out there but I want to do the film a
[29:42.720 --> 29:47.600]  favor and I'll tell all my listeners go see oblivion I'll decode it for you at
[29:47.600 --> 29:51.120]  the bottom of the next hour martial law coming up we're on the March the

[36:13.360 --> 36:17.560]  like nothing else and that they're obsessed with that obviously now it's
[36:17.560 --> 36:22.240]  out so it's not a secret the bad guy from the movie is on the cover of my
[36:22.240 --> 36:32.720]  magazine from October of last year out of my mind that's why this movie freaked
[36:32.720 --> 36:40.080]  me out so bad because again it's an archetype and these archetypes are
[36:40.080 --> 36:47.280]  things that we already inherently know to be true very very bizarre but as I
[36:47.280 --> 36:50.840]  said I'm gonna get to that at the bottom of the hour or I can just go to Google

[37:28.720 --> 37:37.400]  crew but my my design you see this show is a warning ladies and gentlemen the
[37:37.400 --> 37:40.640]  Illuminati this is what they're planning this is what they say they're
[37:40.640 --> 37:55.320]  going to do you understand that this is an emergency transmission but let me
[37:55.320 --> 38:02.960]  actually show you the exact bad guy from the movie please this that right there
[38:02.960 --> 38:10.320]  if you're watching on TV all right that's enough man it's like a brain
[38:10.320 --> 38:12.840]  booster something seeing that movie and you know I don't just come up here and
[38:12.840 --> 38:15.760]  rave about movies I think they're pretty much all cheesy even if they're well
[38:15.760 --> 38:19.280]  done I watch Stanley Kubrick films now and see all the subtleties and the
[38:19.280 --> 38:23.160]  messages but but you know still it's not as powerful as they were when I was
[38:23.160 --> 38:28.200]  younger I don't want to say I'm cynical I just him well researched and can see
[38:28.200 --> 38:33.200]  multi-layers into things as any of you can if you simply open your mind up to
[38:33.200 --> 38:37.480]  the universe and become truly illuminated you see the Illuminati is a
[38:37.480 --> 38:42.920]  counterfeit of what the god of the universe will actually give you and it's
[38:42.920 --> 38:49.800]  a pale counterfeit a shadow of a shadow of a counterfeit I'm gonna give the
[38:49.800 --> 39:04.400]  number out right now it's 800-259-9231 800-259-9231 800-259-9231 and we will get
[39:04.400 --> 39:09.000]  you up and on the air
[39:13.080 --> 39:17.360]  you're never gonna see a representation of the devil more accurate than what's on
[39:17.360 --> 39:29.160]  your screen right now that's the devil right there and what's it doing it's
[39:29.160 --> 39:38.560]  jacking your humanity and destroying it and it uses the best of us against us
[39:38.560 --> 39:47.440]  via compartmentalization all right let me get into the news here I have an
[39:47.440 --> 39:52.600]  article here where the federal government is looking at forced
[39:52.600 --> 40:05.640]  psychological testing for all Americans the New Freedom Initiative 2.0
[40:05.640 --> 40:10.280]  Meanwhile America is number one in fear stress anger divorce obesity
[40:10.280 --> 40:15.840]  antidepressants etc. Las Vegas Hospital accused of dumping psychiatric
[40:15.840 --> 40:18.640]  patients in California accused of it they're doing it all over the country
[40:18.640 --> 40:23.280]  bedbugs invade hospitals why more patients share rooms with blood-sucking
[40:23.280 --> 40:28.720]  pests why are hospitals the most dangerous place to go because it's
[40:28.720 --> 40:33.320]  where the government is in control it's where Rockefeller medicine is in control
[40:33.320 --> 40:38.840]  if I've got a gunshot wound or a compound fracture or a finger cut off I'll
[40:38.840 --> 40:45.880]  take the risk to go to the hospital but if I need something else I'll go to a
[40:45.880 --> 40:52.480]  little local clean new clinic and they're trying to federalize those right
[40:52.480 --> 40:59.680]  now and why do I mention that it's because they're gonna force more people
[40:59.680 --> 41:02.880]  on drugs then you're gonna have more mass shootings and the answer will be more
[41:02.880 --> 41:09.000]  psychologists more psychiatrists as the priest guild to go around and drug
[41:09.000 --> 41:15.280]  America out so bad that we fall because the world is gonna get so horrible
[41:15.280 --> 41:22.320]  you're going to want drugs to get you out of it the GMO the fluoride the
[41:22.320 --> 41:26.920]  chemicals in the water when all you really need is to go out and play sports
[41:26.920 --> 41:32.160]  with your friends climb a hill go for a swim and yeah go get drunk if you want
[41:32.160 --> 41:35.080]  to I'm not even saying that's the best thing out there but it's a lot better
[41:35.080 --> 41:39.960]  than Prozac type drugs they show in major studies there's several of me
[41:39.960 --> 41:42.880]  university of Texas tell you know there's they've got a German study a
[41:42.880 --> 41:47.520]  Russian study drinking is associated with higher IQs why is that because people
[41:47.520 --> 41:52.480]  that have higher IQs cannot handle it you can't handle the truth you can't
[41:52.480 --> 41:57.320]  handle the perception you can't handle how hardcore reality is let me tell you
[41:57.320 --> 42:02.880]  not being on caffeine not drinking at night is like being on a drug because
[42:02.880 --> 42:10.440]  the world is so real and so vivid and so incredible that you want to go drink a
[42:10.440 --> 42:14.360]  bottle of red wine a big steak and lay back and watch a football game because
[42:14.360 --> 42:19.000]  reality is hammer blows
[42:20.080 --> 42:24.400]  now they're just psychology today I tell you people drink more alcohol they've
[42:24.400 --> 42:28.040]  got a university of Texas study to on higher IQs living longer the problem is
[42:28.040 --> 42:34.680]  there's the abuse of it I mean you know sometimes I need to turn my brain off I
[42:34.680 --> 42:38.320]  know drinking makes me overweight and stuff I don't drink that much had a
[42:38.320 --> 42:42.080]  couple drinks with my dad last night at the movie
[42:42.080 --> 42:59.080]  what do you do what do you do knowing all this you know that's what I think
[42:59.080 --> 43:02.800]  every day I almost feel ashamed like I don't almost feel ashamed I am ashamed
[43:02.800 --> 43:07.880]  I am ashamed that I dropped the ball because I need to do a better job for
[43:07.880 --> 43:12.120]  myself and you and my family everybody else and so do you how I got caught up
[43:12.120 --> 43:16.120]  trying to convince people it's staged how I got caught up in all the minutia
[43:16.120 --> 43:20.760]  when the big story is martial law in Boston and citizens being treated like
[43:20.760 --> 43:26.160]  slaves and and then debating would the government provocateur something they've
[43:26.160 --> 43:29.640]  been caught over and over again you know I should just focus on the thousands of
[43:29.640 --> 43:34.880]  declassified programs some of which had thousands of dead apiece where they
[43:34.880 --> 43:40.200]  nerve gas and bio weapon our own trips foster kids for sterilized people
[43:40.200 --> 43:48.320]  radiate foster kids all declassified our government since the 30s has been
[43:48.320 --> 43:52.760]  running eugenics covert operations thousands of which have been declassified
[43:52.760 --> 43:59.560]  the last ones declassified are from the 90s where they kill people oh but if they
[43:59.560 --> 44:04.840]  take a foster child in New York in 2004 the social workers finally spoke
[44:04.840 --> 44:08.760]  out and deliver little black kids mainly eight-year-olds they told that they
[44:08.760 --> 44:11.640]  tell them others they always profile okay you got a two-year-old we're gonna
[44:11.640 --> 44:14.760]  take a two-year-old as you sign this waiver we're gonna take your eight-year-old
[44:14.760 --> 44:19.200]  healthy by the way and they took them to a big pharma facility this was in the
[44:19.200 --> 44:23.440]  New York news only once or twice because whistleblowers went public the media
[44:23.440 --> 44:26.080]  had the courage to cover it then they got shoveled on the rug you heard about
[44:26.080 --> 44:31.560]  kids being given deadly AIDS drugs who didn't even have HIV because they needed
[44:31.560 --> 44:36.840]  quote healthy subjects like a rat you know oh this is this this shampoo is
[44:36.840 --> 44:41.160]  animal testing free it's like oh good good what about human testing free oh
[44:41.160 --> 44:45.440]  they just take your economy away and then make you have to go to pay the rent
[44:45.440 --> 44:51.840]  and and had medical experiments well not just testing deadly chemotherapy
[44:51.840 --> 44:56.640]  drugs on kids they took black kids because you know that blacks have been
[44:56.640 --> 45:00.640]  that you know the test group all along who've been allowed to be tested on you
[45:00.640 --> 45:03.960]  let the hookers operate there let the drugs operate there you know what do
[45:03.960 --> 45:07.960]  they say in the godfather their animals anyways let them lose their souls well
[45:07.960 --> 45:11.640]  the globalists see everybody as animals except them when in truth that they're
[45:11.640 --> 45:16.320]  beyond the animals they have lost their humanity their psychopathic they're
[45:16.320 --> 45:20.240]  cold-blooded they're a joke and they've got a bunch of nobodies working for them
[45:20.240 --> 45:27.440]  on power trips who want to be warriors but really you're just bullies because
[45:27.440 --> 45:31.480]  they're scared to death of real war they're too weak minded to face what's
[45:31.480 --> 45:35.960]  happening and I'm reading I was in New York Daily News you name it about you
[45:35.960 --> 45:38.240]  know one family where they told the mother we'll take your two-year-old you
[45:38.240 --> 45:41.960]  don't do this and they took the child and then they tested pesticides on him
[45:41.960 --> 45:46.000]  for a month until he tried to get away so they chained him down and then they
[45:46.000 --> 45:51.960]  administered the pesticides in higher and higher dosages till he died in a
[45:51.960 --> 46:01.520]  pesticide study and finally the CPS went you know these kids are dying this
[46:01.520 --> 46:05.840]  isn't saw this isn't hostile where you go and they get school to watch women
[46:05.840 --> 46:09.320]  tortured you know and live through that and kind of who that makes me feel
[46:09.320 --> 46:13.160]  powerful so you're scared deep down you're so powerless that you get off
[46:13.160 --> 46:17.520]  vicariously sing simulated torture don't worry they're real little kids
[46:17.520 --> 46:21.160]  being tortured right now there's medical experiments in China with little kids
[46:21.160 --> 46:24.520]  don't worry don't worry and it's gonna happen to you you're being
[46:24.520 --> 46:28.120]  experimented on by the vaccines and the water of the food you think you're gonna
[46:28.120 --> 46:32.680]  go watch this in a movie at your little low level and then it's not gonna be done
[46:32.680 --> 46:37.160]  to you don't worry you're gonna die horribly painful torture deaths don't
[46:37.160 --> 46:42.400]  worry you love hurting innocence God is gonna smash you into a thousand pieces
[46:42.400 --> 46:48.000]  but very slowly by letting the system do it to you yeah there's a headline
[46:48.000 --> 46:52.680]  organic consumers EPA to allow pesticide testing on orphans and mentally
[46:52.680 --> 46:57.560]  handicapped children that was an article I think of months before it came out but
[46:57.560 --> 47:02.640]  and I remember the article described the little black boy he stopped
[47:02.640 --> 47:10.560]  struggling they administered the final dosages and he died oh it's so liberal
[47:10.560 --> 47:14.920]  like the baby swimming in the toilet and people on my YouTube made jokes on
[47:14.920 --> 47:18.400]  them fours going there are too many people Jones you know don't tell them
[47:18.400 --> 47:27.840]  what to do the baby's getting exercise I'll get you and your little dog too yeah
[47:27.840 --> 47:31.960]  you're real powerful all you evil people I bet you'd be real tough in the ring
[47:31.960 --> 47:37.160]  with somebody with a battle axe here here's your battle axe here's a good guy
[47:37.160 --> 47:41.280]  up against any dales smash your guts into the ground but only because we know
[47:41.280 --> 47:45.320]  we're dealing with some scum that's got to be put down we don't enjoy it we'll
[47:45.320 --> 47:50.600]  crush you for the innocence not because we enjoy it your cowards your cowards
[47:50.600 --> 47:54.120]  and the only six satisfaction I've gotten I repent for it is no one this
[47:54.120 --> 47:59.560]  evil system you're bringing in it's gonna tear your guts out slow and you're
[47:59.560 --> 48:05.400]  damned to hell after that make sure you know that
[48:05.400 --> 48:13.240]  do not stare too long into the abyss let's you become the abyss
[48:13.560 --> 48:19.680]  God I watch the police in those videos in Boston stomping around bugging their
[48:19.680 --> 48:24.120]  eyes out with crazy looks on their faces and just saying open your door and

[54:23.120 --> 54:26.480]  anti-new world order they've been anti-new order for a long time but now a
[54:26.480 --> 54:30.520]  lot of their new music is just a total anti-new world order and the good news
[54:30.520 --> 54:33.880]  is more and more good people are realizing what's happening out there
[54:33.880 --> 54:39.520]  the film cloud Atlas was anti-new world order I mean there are a lot of people
[54:39.520 --> 54:42.760]  really starting to get the dehumanization that's taking place and
[54:42.760 --> 54:46.720]  realizing that there's no future if we don't turn things around reason I brought
[54:46.720 --> 54:49.840]  that up as John Baum was pointing that out to me and yes you're right John you're
[54:49.840 --> 54:54.000]  right I agree with you look we're gonna come back and take your calls Anthony
[54:54.000 --> 54:59.960]  John Shelley Daniel Jacob and others it's open phones today no guest I need to
[54:59.960 --> 55:05.120]  get to listening to my message that I left myself for my voice memos so that
[55:05.120 --> 55:11.120]  I can write down all the notes I've got on my oblivion review I want to do at the
[55:11.120 --> 55:13.640]  bottom of the next hour who knows I may do at the start of the next hour but then
[55:13.640 --> 55:19.000]  I'll never get to it if I don't get to it soon so I've got that you've got all
[55:19.000 --> 55:23.640]  this incredible stuff happening all the evidence this was scripted and then you
[55:23.640 --> 55:29.760]  get things like this in the Huffington Post California gun confiscation bill
[55:29.760 --> 55:36.320]  passes approves 24 million to expedite illegal gun seizure and it says it makes
[55:36.320 --> 55:42.360]  your semi-auto is basically illegal and we'll begin the door-to-door confiscation
[55:42.360 --> 55:50.480]  of 40,000 handguns and assault weapons illegally owned by Californians SB 140
[55:50.480 --> 56:02.000]  oh man there you go but oh there's no gun confiscation coming and again it's not
[56:02.000 --> 56:05.960]  only that they did this martial law drill they're saying this shows this is
[56:05.960 --> 56:10.280]  the new America the Wall Street Journal says this is how you're going to live
[56:10.280 --> 56:16.160]  for your safety for three dead people in an event that's got fingerprints of the
[56:16.160 --> 56:19.600]  globalist all over it and then you've got the hyping and they're saying there
[56:19.600 --> 56:23.960]  will be more bombings the good news is they were going to go with the two party
[56:23.960 --> 56:27.880]  that was clear we derailed them so they went with their fallback patsies who the
[56:27.880 --> 56:31.760]  FBI knew and watch for years and knew where they lived and they were at their
[56:31.760 --> 56:35.960]  houses and at their dorms like nothing had happened until they got the word the
[56:35.960 --> 56:40.400]  mother says and then something scared them so they fled and then you've got
[56:40.400 --> 56:46.120]  what the couple witness the witnesses are saying conflicting things to but we
[56:46.120 --> 56:50.520]  have the unprecedented and now Kurt Nemo has added images to the Watson
[56:50.520 --> 56:58.600]  article that drudge linked to go to drudge report dot com in the middle
[56:58.600 --> 57:05.960]  column it says Boston residents ordered out of homes and then you notice the
[57:05.960 --> 57:08.760]  Daily Mail is under it and they added more videos that that's our articles the
[57:08.760 --> 57:12.000]  original they wrote off our article and give us credit in the Daily Mail but
[57:12.000 --> 57:15.400]  that's what I told them this morning is just add more videos and photos because
[57:15.400 --> 57:18.840]  we've literally got hundreds of photos and dozens of videos I'm trying to dig
[57:18.840 --> 57:24.280]  up the one I know we were taping when it happened when CNN showed the woman at
[57:24.280 --> 57:27.400]  her house to try to buy a park with her kids and they fly over in the day and go
[57:27.400 --> 57:32.440]  get in your house I mean I'm sorry man I'm not getting in my house I had enough
[57:32.440 --> 57:37.280]  of you the borders are wide open illegal aliens are above the law nothing
[57:37.280 --> 57:41.280]  even against them the point is that is this is all about training the American
[57:41.280 --> 57:44.680]  citizens that were like milk cows or something and I'm not your slave and I'm
[57:44.680 --> 57:49.000]  sick of it they use security is the new slavery we're gonna enslave you to keep
[57:49.000 --> 57:52.960]  you safe no thanks I'll take my Bill of Rights and Constitution everything
[57:52.960 --> 57:56.200]  that's happening is 180 degrees the opposite of the Bill of Rights and

[58:15.160 --> 58:19.920]  house and shoot you in the back of the head and take your guns and put you in a
[58:19.920 --> 58:25.640]  FEMA camp in America and I put that in my film police day 2000 and I interviewed
[58:25.640 --> 58:28.960]  police chiefs and others who were all vets who said this is a martial law
[58:28.960 --> 58:33.520]  conditioning drill Chief Ali Philippus Thomas Sanchez you name it these are
[58:33.520 --> 58:37.120]  police chiefs and people I'm listening here who I have on video I've been

[1:00:13.280 --> 1:00:21.120]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[1:00:21.120 --> 1:00:25.720]  all right I'm gonna go to your phone calls then we'll get into the raft of
[1:00:25.720 --> 1:00:31.440]  anti-American insider crony capitalist mafia consolidation that's coming on
[1:00:31.440 --> 1:00:35.280]  from internet sales taxes that Obama's ramming through right now to just
[1:00:35.280 --> 1:00:40.480]  everything that's happening martial law in Boston linked up on the drugs
[1:00:40.480 --> 1:00:44.760]  report and we've got photos of them aiming guns at men women and children for
[1:00:44.760 --> 1:00:50.160]  no reason shoving women around look out of your house lady you look nothing like
[1:00:50.160 --> 1:00:53.720]  any suspect we're just gonna do this this was done all over the place in a
[1:00:53.720 --> 1:00:59.040]  giant act of just planting the flag on the good old slaves and commenters are
[1:00:59.040 --> 1:01:04.760]  in here go and try that south of the Mason Dixon line boy oh like Katrina we
[1:01:04.760 --> 1:01:11.520]  tell you they'll always give you an excuse and a reason a shy op and I'm
[1:01:11.520 --> 1:01:14.480]  telling you and the police and military are just spoiling for a war with the
[1:01:14.480 --> 1:01:19.240]  American people just spoiling just spoiling I saw G20 where they would
[1:01:19.240 --> 1:01:23.600]  just run up to a nobody was resisting him nobody was coming out so the G20 was
[1:01:23.600 --> 1:01:29.120]  over that night Rob do got arrested you want a lawsuit over it and word comes
[1:01:29.120 --> 1:01:31.480]  they're gonna not let university students be out at the park at night so
[1:01:31.480 --> 1:01:34.760]  they're out there like they always are it's like eight at night and they they
[1:01:34.760 --> 1:01:38.480]  blocked the road so nobody can even get back in their dorms and then like women
[1:01:38.480 --> 1:01:41.600]  are on bicycles and cops knock them off and then just start splitting their
[1:01:41.600 --> 1:01:44.920]  heads because it's not that's like a that's like a fringe benefit to get a
[1:01:44.920 --> 1:01:47.920]  beat a woman with a billy club if you're a sadomasochist or I guess a
[1:01:47.920 --> 1:01:52.080]  masochist who are the ones that like to beat people I guess they're the sadist
[1:01:52.080 --> 1:01:56.200]  yeah they're the sadist and it's like well that's pro law enforcement I know
[1:01:56.200 --> 1:02:00.560]  and now the state police at Texas say they will proctology you that's okay
[1:02:00.560 --> 1:02:05.200]  they say that proctology you just got it would put a different glove on you see
[1:02:05.200 --> 1:02:09.720]  so that's just some of what's coming up today and I support the police I think
[1:02:09.720 --> 1:02:13.440]  it's good I think the police should have executed everyone in Boston just to
[1:02:13.440 --> 1:02:17.760]  make sure the police are safe because you know when cops shoot somebody who's
[1:02:17.760 --> 1:02:21.760]  innocent it's not even in the nose hardly but but you know this I mean this
[1:02:21.760 --> 1:02:26.160]  whole event nowhere in the world would they lock down most of a major city and
[1:02:26.160 --> 1:02:29.280]  to kick everybody out of their houses for I mean for for a thousand
[1:02:29.280 --> 1:02:33.880]  combatants you wouldn't do that I mean this is beyond martial law it's just see
[1:02:33.880 --> 1:02:37.560]  what they can get away with can TSA take your five-year-old to a private room
[1:02:37.560 --> 1:02:41.880]  where some pot billied guy with a creepy mustache grabs them absolutely and
[1:02:41.880 --> 1:02:47.840]  you're a terrorist if you don't like it it was a defrocked priest or a you know
[1:02:47.840 --> 1:02:51.560]  Sunday School teacher that caught molesting people put him in heaven make
[1:02:51.560 --> 1:02:55.960]  him the head of the TSA in that airport why not it's over the top teach the
[1:02:55.960 --> 1:03:01.600]  slaves to submit properly Anthony on the Boston bombing go ahead
[1:03:01.600 --> 1:03:05.720]  first-time caller thanks for taking it you know I think of her call screening
[1:03:05.720 --> 1:03:09.560]  you may need a proctology exam to be on my show we know there's not a bomb up
[1:03:09.560 --> 1:03:15.760]  your pituit now I think that it's unbelievable how you know once again
[1:03:15.760 --> 1:03:20.920]  this police commissioner this this clown he comes out slips up again very
[1:03:20.920 --> 1:03:25.920]  obvious that he's under the order of someone else oh yeah that police chief
[1:03:25.920 --> 1:03:30.640]  looks like he is he is a total creep and he looks like he's totally hiding stuff
[1:03:30.640 --> 1:03:34.600]  oh gee you think a major police chief's hiding stuff oh yeah and I definitely
[1:03:34.600 --> 1:03:40.640]  wanted to shout out to Dan Badan they for shaking his boots up did you see
[1:03:40.640 --> 1:03:44.440]  those people when when when he was in that press conference if we had a
[1:03:44.440 --> 1:03:48.840]  dam without a everywhere that's something like this happens we would be
[1:03:48.840 --> 1:03:52.840]  winning even though we're already winning am I right you know he's got a
[1:03:52.840 --> 1:03:57.320]  nickname around here and it's it's the Titan or the Kraken he the Kraken is a
[1:03:57.320 --> 1:04:01.560]  Titan we say release the Kraken because every time you send him to
[1:04:01.560 --> 1:04:05.640]  something that's what happens Dan Badan D it's it's not even courage he knows
[1:04:05.640 --> 1:04:10.160]  they're bad guys he has an instinct to fight evil and he also freaks people out
[1:04:10.160 --> 1:04:15.960]  because he in person he looks like an overgrown doctor evil in a good way
[1:04:15.960 --> 1:04:22.000]  he's like the good doctor evil but absolutely anything else in the Dan
[1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:26.120]  Badan D worship session here now that that's it thanks for taking my call
[1:04:26.120 --> 1:04:30.840]  all right God bless you man yeah no we need people that are I'm not ragging I
[1:04:30.840 --> 1:04:35.400]  pioneered in modern times in the last 18 years going out and confronting people
[1:04:35.400 --> 1:04:38.560]  at press conferences because nobody would ever ask real questions every time I
[1:04:38.560 --> 1:04:42.720]  talk to ask Bush a question or Janet Reno a question or you know Al Gore a
[1:04:42.720 --> 1:04:46.200]  question it would end up being national niche and that's what we are change does
[1:04:46.200 --> 1:04:50.960]  and you should all do it and just go and ask real questions and everybody else
[1:04:50.960 --> 1:04:54.160]  are paid operatives and you know selling their family out so all I can say to the
[1:04:54.160 --> 1:04:57.640]  reporters is give your kids more shots you can bury him a lot quicker because
[1:04:57.640 --> 1:05:02.720]  you know the government loves you in the last two years alone the US has seen
[1:05:02.720 --> 1:05:07.800]  huge losses to our food supply in 2011 storms and floods raged across the US
[1:05:07.800 --> 1:05:12.240]  costing us 20 billion and lost crops alone in 2012 we saw the largest drought
[1:05:12.240 --> 1:05:16.360]  in the country in more than 50 years you may think out of sight out of mind and
[1:05:16.360 --> 1:05:20.880]  so you don't think you will be affected the fact is you are we all are food
[1:05:20.880 --> 1:05:24.920]  shortages drive prices up for everyone you might not be able to control mother

[1:11:28.960 --> 1:11:36.640]  of Rome and its golden age you could not bring troops past the Rubicon River in
[1:11:36.640 --> 1:11:41.520]  northern Italy troops were not allowed in Italy period unless the Senate
[1:11:41.520 --> 1:11:48.000]  officially voted if Rome itself was being invaded or if Italy itself was
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:53.760]  being invaded now why couldn't you bring troops into Rome why does Posse
[1:11:53.760 --> 1:11:57.760]  commentators 1878 and before that the Bill of Rights Constitution say no
[1:11:57.760 --> 1:12:02.280]  troops quartered why because they'd lived under it and they were historians
[1:12:02.280 --> 1:12:07.080]  who spoke on average five languages because back then being a rock star was
[1:12:07.080 --> 1:12:10.960]  that you invented things you could speak four or five languages if somebody
[1:12:10.960 --> 1:12:14.520]  smarted off to you you'd say all right get your sword we're going outside that's
[1:12:14.520 --> 1:12:18.440]  what women liked back then that's what the newspapers wrote about so we had a
[1:12:18.440 --> 1:12:23.560]  flowering where being smart was cool it was called the Renaissance it was called
[1:12:23.560 --> 1:12:30.520]  the Enlightenment it was not land of the cowards home of the slaves it was land
[1:12:30.520 --> 1:12:34.120]  of you tread on me buddy I don't know how this is gonna am but you're gonna get

[1:12:44.480 --> 1:12:47.800]  and there's some evidence they may have been probably set up double agents now
[1:12:47.800 --> 1:12:52.720]  coming out yeah the cops have pulled SUVs up if it's true and got out and had a
[1:12:52.720 --> 1:12:56.080]  firefight with these guys that you're doing your job but you're a man you're

[1:18:08.240 --> 1:18:11.440]  against the nation like burning down wake over captured that's the law I've

[1:18:30.160 --> 1:18:33.560]  I said I'm a black man I've been the ghetto well I'm out of the ghetto now thank
[1:18:33.560 --> 1:18:38.400]  God but I've been a part of beta test I've seen it from the ground I've seen
[1:18:38.400 --> 1:18:41.480]  that I've been a part where they start resisting you stop resisting you're not
[1:18:41.480 --> 1:18:45.480]  even resisting you're still getting beat so I understand that and to see what
[1:18:45.480 --> 1:18:50.480]  happened in Boston America you guys need to wake up I don't think it's enough I
[1:18:50.480 --> 1:18:54.400]  think if they just say resist they should gun you and your whole family down
[1:18:54.400 --> 1:18:58.120]  and if you've got a baby take it out of a stroller and just smash its brains out
[1:18:58.120 --> 1:19:02.440]  and use it as a face cream for the police if it's sunny outside as a as a
[1:19:02.440 --> 1:19:09.040]  sunscreen I think to respect police like they did in the Aztec Kingdom and the
[1:19:09.040 --> 1:19:13.160]  Druid Kingdom we should sacrifice our children to them they should pass a
[1:19:13.160 --> 1:19:17.720]  national law to sacrifice our children to the government at the Washington
[1:19:17.720 --> 1:19:22.800]  Monument it'll be like Logan's Run you'll beg them because if they said it
[1:19:22.800 --> 1:19:27.680]  was like you'll be a TV star and it's really cool like American Idol if you
[1:19:27.680 --> 1:19:30.760]  get to say beat your child to death with a ball peen hammer on the steps of the
[1:19:30.760 --> 1:19:34.240]  Capitol then it would be good I mean don't you think that's a good idea for
[1:19:34.240 --> 1:19:38.040]  America sir that's what they're trying to give their impression to the people
[1:19:38.040 --> 1:19:42.640]  that sir what's wrong with being pulled over and having police put on gloves and
[1:19:42.640 --> 1:19:47.240]  put them inside two women's bodies four orifices I mean that that's that'll be
[1:19:47.240 --> 1:19:51.880]  the American flag the American flag ought to be a person in a uniform with a

[1:24:38.280 --> 1:24:41.480]  and most of you have ancestors that were involved in founding this great

[1:24:50.280 --> 1:24:53.880]  recognize the evil what's coming next if city-wide they come to your house point
[1:24:53.880 --> 1:24:56.840]  guns at you and come in your house without warrants looking for one guy
[1:24:56.840 --> 1:25:02.480]  knowing they were testing a media psiop the average cop didn't even know that
[1:25:02.480 --> 1:25:06.080]  and obviously some of the cops didn't act like total jerks but they were still
[1:25:06.080 --> 1:25:10.920]  carrying out unlawful orders and their whole search of the city didn't find
[1:25:10.920 --> 1:25:16.120]  the guy the lockdown kept people from finding him in the back of the boat that
[1:25:16.120 --> 1:25:20.720]  later came out I'm gonna go back to your calls I'm gonna do the oblivion thing
[1:25:20.720 --> 1:25:26.320]  next hour I promise I will my review of that and how the anti-aluminati turned
[1:25:26.320 --> 1:25:31.840]  to force I'll just leave it at that but they are now the state police of Texas
[1:25:31.840 --> 1:25:36.160]  now will pull you over not even for speeding and tell you to bend over the
[1:25:36.160 --> 1:25:39.280]  car and they will ram your hand their hand into your body and the state police
[1:25:39.280 --> 1:25:44.600]  head said that is normal we authorized that and they are now in court defending
[1:25:44.600 --> 1:25:48.280]  against the indictment of the state police saying no this is normal they
[1:25:48.280 --> 1:25:51.960]  were in the news saying it's normal so when I say hey you know we don't know if
[1:25:51.960 --> 1:25:57.000]  John in Missouri we don't know me that has bombs in him why guilty and to
[1:25:57.000 --> 1:26:04.160]  prove an innocent government always does this that's why it's against the law
[1:26:04.160 --> 1:26:09.360]  that's why it's stated in the Constitution Bill of Rights the government
[1:26:09.360 --> 1:26:14.360]  can't do this that's why Bloomberg says get rid of it because there are a
[1:26:14.360 --> 1:26:17.360]  bunch of crooks that have stolen this country I'll call Bloomberg a crook
[1:26:17.360 --> 1:26:20.680]  trying to take our rights trying to rule our life trying to shut down gun
[1:26:20.680 --> 1:26:25.000]  manufacturers around the country with racketeering type activities there are
[1:26:25.000 --> 1:26:29.480]  bunch of crooks a bunch of dirty crooks the fast and furious crowd all of them
[1:26:29.480 --> 1:26:34.200]  they're a mafia that once you disarmed so they can treat you how they want and
[1:26:34.200 --> 1:26:39.760]  to be above the law that's what the New World Order is and I talk about you know
[1:26:39.760 --> 1:26:43.680]  sarcastically I shouldn't even joke people think oh it's for the government
[1:26:43.680 --> 1:26:46.840]  and kill their kids that's how if we have like a government worshipper listening
[1:26:46.840 --> 1:26:51.000]  the status they might actually say that's a good idea in every culture every
[1:26:51.000 --> 1:26:58.360]  culture in known anthropology and archaeology every culture gets a
[1:26:58.360 --> 1:27:03.240]  civilization then becomes decadent centralized and the leaders demand human
[1:27:03.240 --> 1:27:07.960]  sacrifice of babies and children and women first it's bring me the best food
[1:27:07.960 --> 1:27:12.400]  and bring me your your virgins to the temple because you know I'm the high
[1:27:12.400 --> 1:27:16.720]  priest and I want to you know do things to him then it's you know what I want to
[1:27:16.720 --> 1:27:20.840]  kill kids bring me your kids and people do it and then they finally say this is
[1:27:20.840 --> 1:27:25.440]  usually when they the priest group it's overthrown for a while they go I want the
[1:27:25.440 --> 1:27:32.080]  king's firstborn and and the king gets mad and doesn't do it you can study in a
[1:27:32.080 --> 1:27:38.400]  bunch different cultures they start demanding the king be sacrificed the
[1:27:38.400 --> 1:27:42.840]  bureaucrats if the bureaucrats had their way they would start demanding whoever
[1:27:42.840 --> 1:27:46.280]  the titular had was be sacrificed that's pretty much what the Kennedy
[1:27:46.280 --> 1:27:50.400]  assassination was this is all Illuminati stuff folks I don't believe in it they
[1:27:50.400 --> 1:27:54.960]  do people say this is wild stuff it's history I dare you to show me a culture
[1:27:54.960 --> 1:27:59.680]  where they didn't engage in human sacrifice the Greeks did it the Romans
[1:27:59.680 --> 1:28:05.040]  did it the Babylonians did it the Japanese did it what do you think war is
[1:28:05.040 --> 1:28:11.200]  sending our sons off all right I'm ranting John finish up your points I'm
[1:28:11.200 --> 1:28:14.240]  gonna come back and walk seven get to Jacob Lucy Shelley Paul and others go
[1:28:14.240 --> 1:28:18.400]  ahead and finish your point sir just real briefly like I say I live in the
[1:28:18.400 --> 1:28:24.080]  ghetto for a few years and I was able to manage and watch how they operate I
[1:28:24.080 --> 1:28:29.360]  mean they operate not all of them was bad I'm not saying the whole police was
[1:28:29.360 --> 1:28:35.200]  bad but just when you're watching every day kicking into another dog getting
[1:28:35.200 --> 1:28:39.480]  kicked in you see how they operate you see when you getting followed into your
[1:28:39.480 --> 1:28:42.920]  house they know who you are when they know where the drugs that and they're
[1:28:42.920 --> 1:28:47.720]  not harassing those people then it's very obvious that it's something wrong
[1:28:47.720 --> 1:28:53.240]  but when you see it on a mass scale like something like Boston and I turn in
[1:28:53.240 --> 1:28:57.800]  with NBC I've seen the pictures on your site and when you see that I mean I'm
[1:28:57.800 --> 1:29:02.480]  not the smartest guy in the world but that's obvious that that they're just
[1:29:02.480 --> 1:29:06.600]  letting you know it's it it's time games over this is what you're going to go
[1:29:06.600 --> 1:29:10.240]  through and I'm telling you when you go through that every day because I've been
[1:29:10.240 --> 1:29:15.680]  through that every day guns out point at you when you get when it's pulled up to
[1:29:15.680 --> 1:29:19.280]  your car they act like you are the criminal when they got the drugs I mean
[1:29:19.280 --> 1:29:23.920]  you've watched them take drugs from people and just not arrest them I mean
[1:29:23.920 --> 1:29:29.240]  I know listen they listen they took down China by making drugs illegal and so
[1:29:29.240 --> 1:29:31.680]  they could corrupt the police and that's how the West took them over the
[1:29:31.680 --> 1:29:37.360]  opium wars look it up folks this is an exact plan they're following and it's
[1:29:37.360 --> 1:29:41.440]  not our opinion either the police the military the media decides to join the
[1:29:41.440 --> 1:29:45.200]  people or they give into this total takeover but don't think you're part of
[1:29:45.200 --> 1:29:50.080]  the winning team folks you're under attack as well in this oblivion we're

[1:35:06.840 --> 1:35:10.840]  everything with internet sales taxes I've read the bill it is so draconian
[1:35:10.840 --> 1:35:15.680]  makes your head spin and here's the good news people are finally freaking out I
[1:35:15.680 --> 1:35:19.760]  monitor at home in the morning and driving into work in the morning and
[1:35:19.760 --> 1:35:23.760]  driving around doing errands and things at night talk radio national and local
[1:35:23.760 --> 1:35:29.480]  everybody's freaking out like 90% of the callers about it all people are really
[1:35:29.480 --> 1:35:34.680]  getting it but you don't just need to get it you need to say no you need to not
[1:35:34.680 --> 1:35:38.880]  comply with stuff that's unconstitutional and you need to work like the
[1:35:38.880 --> 1:35:47.680]  dickens to do everything you can to warn people ahead of this because it's
[1:35:47.680 --> 1:35:50.680]  not enough to buy guns and just wait in your cabin and say first person comes
[1:35:50.680 --> 1:35:54.280]  around here is deader than a hammer you need to spend that energy in the
[1:35:54.280 --> 1:36:01.560]  information war hammered down screaming bloody murder because ladies and
[1:36:01.560 --> 1:36:05.400]  gentlemen they're getting away with everything right now and again you're
[1:36:05.400 --> 1:36:07.880]  like why would they declare martial law in a whole city call it a civil
[1:36:07.880 --> 1:36:14.160]  emergency always told you they'll call a civil emergency public safety and that
[1:36:14.160 --> 1:36:18.240]  and you notice it's never gonna be called martial law it was called a civil
[1:36:18.240 --> 1:36:22.400]  emergency public safety when they looted the first houses they went to were in
[1:36:22.400 --> 1:36:25.960]  the high and dry area in Louisiana some of them fifteen million dollar historic
[1:36:25.960 --> 1:36:29.960]  homes I happen to have been given a coffee table book about a year before
[1:36:29.960 --> 1:36:34.520]  that happened as my wife had lived in New Orleans for a few years one of her
[1:36:34.520 --> 1:36:38.760]  family gave her a coffee table book with New Orleans I was reading about the
[1:36:38.760 --> 1:36:49.200]  architecture knew the houses that I was then seeing on television when they were
[1:36:49.200 --> 1:36:52.840]  going in there taking their guns and then I get the army manuals guys punch
[1:36:52.840 --> 1:36:56.120]  up Rob do that I'm going to your calls Rob do is a report that's got two and a
[1:36:56.120 --> 1:37:00.280]  half million views titled military trains to shoot Americans that don't turn
[1:37:00.280 --> 1:37:04.000]  in guns and then it shows the army manual how they process our social
[1:37:04.000 --> 1:37:08.200]  security numbers how they put us in the labor camp how they kill the people that
[1:37:08.200 --> 1:37:13.360]  don't turn the guns in and it's got the army manual number that's an army dot
[1:37:13.360 --> 1:37:19.560]  mill I mean that's a red alert over the top out of control

[1:37:50.320 --> 1:37:53.320]  quietly take it smash it but in the trash I've actually done that and then
[1:37:53.320 --> 1:37:56.160]  that's how I get a new computer because this is I've been going this is about a
[1:37:56.160 --> 1:37:59.360]  week is it time for this computer to die I mean I know it's all the crap they

[1:38:02.640 --> 1:38:05.760]  everywhere go ask Rob you to bring it up to us the videos got two and a half
[1:38:05.760 --> 1:38:10.400]  million views on YouTube US military trains to shoot and kill Americans that

[1:38:15.360 --> 1:38:20.040]  people say don't you know you know don't scare me with this information I'm
[1:38:20.040 --> 1:38:28.080]  not trying to scare you I'm trying to get you to do something I'll call Rob do
[1:38:28.080 --> 1:38:33.720]  let's go ahead and there it is troops ordered to kill all Americans who don't
[1:38:33.720 --> 1:38:38.080]  turn in their guns two million three hundred seventy six thousand now ladies
[1:38:38.080 --> 1:38:42.120]  and gentlemen that needs to have 50 million views okay that needs to have
[1:38:42.120 --> 1:38:46.120]  thank you sir and they keep fixing it keeps not working anyways I'm just
[1:38:46.120 --> 1:38:49.800]  sick of it I'm tired of like trying to convince people we've been taken over by
[1:38:49.800 --> 1:38:53.360]  crooks Congress is having hearings about taking anything they want out of
[1:38:53.360 --> 1:38:57.360]  your bank account no judge no jury and taking all your pensions they will do
[1:38:57.360 --> 1:39:02.280]  it they're hardcore criminals the wives of congressmen in some cases get 10
[1:39:02.280 --> 1:39:07.800]  billion dollar contracts to spy on you they're a pack of larson is scum and all
[1:39:07.800 --> 1:39:11.240]  you idiots that work for the system they will take everything you've got as well
[1:39:11.240 --> 1:39:16.960]  you morons you're not part of the winning team you're under new world order
[1:39:16.960 --> 1:39:21.520]  control you're being poisoned to the food and water and vaccines already and a
[1:39:21.520 --> 1:39:24.840]  lot of you won't listen but when your wife dies young or your kids start dying
[1:39:24.840 --> 1:39:28.480]  or your neighbors start dying like they already are and you look at the numbers
[1:39:28.480 --> 1:39:31.800]  you're gonna learn they're killing you and your family that doesn't matter put
[1:39:31.800 --> 1:39:37.080]  on a black uniform and act tough in front everybody for your egomania or you
[1:39:37.080 --> 1:39:40.880]  know be a bureaucrat spying on people or work in a corporation doing all this
[1:39:40.880 --> 1:39:43.600]  because they're shutting the corporations down that aren't globalist
[1:39:43.600 --> 1:39:47.040]  right now I'm sorry I said I'd take calls I'm just so angry right now I
[1:39:47.040 --> 1:39:51.200]  shouldn't probably be on air I'm so sick of it I'm so tired of it what does it
[1:39:51.200 --> 1:39:55.760]  take people out of their coma this is an enemy foreign banking force planning
[1:39:55.760 --> 1:40:00.000]  its flag on us for martial law training and bragging in the wall street journal
[1:40:00.000 --> 1:40:04.960]  that this is the new America battlefield set up checkpoints arrest take the guns
[1:40:04.960 --> 1:40:14.360]  rob everything don't you get it in Mexico in places in Africa most the
[1:40:14.360 --> 1:40:18.400]  countries that's just the military runs everything and there's no production
[1:40:18.400 --> 1:40:22.080]  because no one even try to build anything or make anything in Africa or
[1:40:22.080 --> 1:40:25.640]  Latin America because the military will get jealous of that and come and rob it
[1:40:25.640 --> 1:40:30.160]  and just so you don't try to get it back they'll kill you all over almost every
[1:40:30.160 --> 1:40:34.920]  African country if you try to build or make anything the military police come
[1:40:34.920 --> 1:40:39.240]  by steal it and then kill you so that you don't ever come back on them and so
[1:40:39.240 --> 1:40:42.760]  there's nothing the whole society falls down till there's one president in a
[1:40:42.760 --> 1:40:46.720]  rotting compound with weapons everywhere with crazed look on his eyes and
[1:40:46.720 --> 1:40:53.280]  giant uniforms with with with with you know shallot all over it you know all
[1:40:53.280 --> 1:40:56.640]  little ribbons and symbols and now you look at our police and military they're
[1:40:56.640 --> 1:41:01.640]  all in Third World dictator clown outfits stumbling around urinating all over
[1:41:01.640 --> 1:41:08.320]  us politically hmm I mean where's the spirit of 1776 where is America well
[1:41:08.320 --> 1:41:11.120]  I'll tell you they're gonna blow stuff up and blame it on us get ready for that
[1:41:11.120 --> 1:41:16.600]  and they're gonna start their fight they're gonna conscript your kids in a
[1:41:16.600 --> 1:41:19.640]  national service your kids are gonna come home it's already happening and
[1:41:19.640 --> 1:41:23.480]  boss you around about the environment and boss you around about your guns and
[1:41:23.480 --> 1:41:27.120]  then report you and then they'll be on the news saluting as you're taking away
[1:41:27.120 --> 1:41:34.520]  to a forced labor camp think I'm joking guys type in army manual reeducation
[1:41:34.520 --> 1:41:38.160]  camp they even use the term reeducation camp you're like why why use the Soviet
[1:41:38.160 --> 1:41:42.880]  term why use the Alexander Schultz and Eastern term why not go all the way yeah
[1:41:42.880 --> 1:41:48.200]  man cow man cow even I was able to talk to these military people he saw a whole
[1:41:48.200 --> 1:41:53.080]  bunch of trucks with mannequins stuffed with dirt that the military been
[1:41:53.080 --> 1:41:56.120]  shooting up of men women and children you're like oh that couldn't be true
[1:41:56.120 --> 1:42:00.280]  oh really they confirmed the targets of five-year-old children and pregnant
[1:42:00.280 --> 1:42:08.560]  women to shoot in tournament resettlement operations fm3-39.40 the
[1:42:08.560 --> 1:42:11.680]  government will get look when they blow stuff they're not just gonna come come
[1:42:11.680 --> 1:42:15.440]  get your guns they're gonna put out a cover story they're going to make it
[1:42:15.440 --> 1:42:18.920]  look like there's a reason they've got to do this to set the precedent as a
[1:42:18.920 --> 1:42:23.560]  scyop to get you to stand down the truth is I talked to a lot of Bostonians who
[1:42:23.560 --> 1:42:27.400]  didn't buy into what happened okay let's go to your calls Jacob in Minnesota
[1:42:27.400 --> 1:42:32.200]  thanks for holding her on the air hello Alex man you got me so worked up right
[1:42:32.200 --> 1:42:36.520]  now you are firing on all cylinders today I'm loving the show I can't thank
[1:42:36.520 --> 1:42:40.560]  you enough for what you do please don't thank me brother well I'm calling
[1:42:40.560 --> 1:42:44.040]  because I wanted to validate you a little bit because you talked about how
[1:42:44.040 --> 1:42:49.560]  people can be so dumb down I shared your videos of YouTube videos where the
[1:42:49.560 --> 1:42:53.200]  Boston police are going door-to-door and taking people out of their home and
[1:42:53.200 --> 1:42:57.400]  people comment on the videos saying oh well there's so many people in the house
[1:42:57.400 --> 1:43:00.640]  look at on look at them coming out they must have been doing something wrong I'm
[1:43:00.640 --> 1:43:05.840]  telling you people are just completely oblivious to what is happening it just
[1:43:05.840 --> 1:43:11.200]  blows my mind that's because they have been scientifically programmed
[1:43:11.200 --> 1:43:16.120]  incrementally on record and when they were arresting us and even putting us in
[1:43:16.120 --> 1:43:20.400]  labor camps because we got to pay our way they will cheer that on as well
[1:43:20.400 --> 1:43:25.720]  because they're so cowardly they will accept anything see once you buy into
[1:43:25.720 --> 1:43:29.400]  evil you've got to keep saying yes to it because you never want to admit you're
[1:43:29.400 --> 1:43:33.200]  wrong you understand these people that the new order looks at these chumps you're
[1:43:33.200 --> 1:43:37.360]  talking about and absolutely sees a dinner it's like a wolf seeing a you
[1:43:37.360 --> 1:43:44.040]  know a a a bloodied sheep what happens and and they think they know it's evil
[1:43:44.040 --> 1:43:48.880]  they think if they grovel to it it's going to be okay and and that's the
[1:43:48.880 --> 1:43:53.200]  spirit that's why it's happening well I just want I just want to thank you for
[1:43:53.200 --> 1:43:56.720]  what you're doing I'm a I go month-to-month on prison planet to support
[1:43:56.720 --> 1:43:59.680]  you a little bit more I want to encourage current prison planet members to do
[1:43:59.680 --> 1:44:02.440]  that and for those of you that are listening because you're getting so much
[1:44:02.440 --> 1:44:06.280]  traffic right now you got to take a look at what Alex Jones has done over the
[1:44:06.280 --> 1:44:10.320]  past 15 years different the information that he throws out there I mean it's
[1:44:10.320 --> 1:44:15.280]  because of your information on us but I no longer just hear the news I create a
[1:44:15.280 --> 1:44:19.880]  web of information in my mind and it is so liberating I can't tell you how
[1:44:19.880 --> 1:44:24.880]  liberating it is to be able to discern from the news not just hear the news and
[1:44:24.880 --> 1:44:29.560]  so I can't think enough to help me do that it's not a way brother what that is
[1:44:29.560 --> 1:44:36.080]  is is is you haven't really brain boosted you're just awake now and people are
[1:44:36.080 --> 1:44:39.640]  asleep their brainwaves are lower they're in a near sleep state they watch
[1:44:39.640 --> 1:44:43.760]  TV all day they shuffle around they act like they're working big studies are
[1:44:43.760 --> 1:44:47.840]  out that about half the workday spent checking email and frittering and so
[1:44:47.840 --> 1:44:52.240]  they're just these lazy shuffling dead people the new world order lives we
[1:44:52.240 --> 1:44:57.640]  sleep and Christ says it's time for the sleeper to awaken and it's time for
[1:44:57.640 --> 1:45:02.960]  people to awaken and then when you know history and you see what's happening and
[1:45:02.960 --> 1:45:06.600]  you know how cold-blooded they are and how much money they're stealing you go
[1:45:06.600 --> 1:45:10.800]  oh my god crooks took over everything and they've hired a bunch of subservient
[1:45:10.800 --> 1:45:16.920]  weirdos that love the exercise of power you know there are people that like to
[1:45:16.920 --> 1:45:22.080]  you know have power who will sit there and you know enjoy abusing farm animals
[1:45:22.080 --> 1:45:26.640]  all day I mean it's basically the same mindset of pressing on the nerve of
[1:45:26.640 --> 1:45:31.640]  power hollow mindless just incredibly bizarre they're getting rid of any due
[1:45:31.640 --> 1:45:35.800]  process in Canada right now to secretly arrest and disappear people with their
[1:45:35.800 --> 1:45:40.800]  fake al-Qaeda deal again the Western governments run al-Qaeda why are we
[1:45:40.800 --> 1:45:44.200]  having to give our rights up because of al-Qaeda they run again it's all two
[1:45:44.200 --> 1:45:49.040]  plus two equals four it's all incredible common sense stuff and that's why I get
[1:45:49.040 --> 1:45:54.360]  so angry that's why I get so mad is that I know about the declassified medical
[1:45:54.360 --> 1:45:58.880]  testing a little kids still going on where they kill little kids the and the
[1:45:58.880 --> 1:46:03.680]  government orders it they're murderers and they kill kids over here and don't
[1:46:03.680 --> 1:46:07.560]  get in trouble exercising their power and then go oh look at this a year old
[1:46:07.560 --> 1:46:13.160]  boy give your rights up to us and and use our own emotion use our goodness
[1:46:13.160 --> 1:46:19.160]  against us get our best men to go serve them and do horrible things because they
[1:46:19.160 --> 1:46:23.040]  believe they're really battling the threat of Islam when it's all a class of
[1:46:23.040 --> 1:46:27.800]  civilizations Pena plan to build up the radical Muslims have us have a war with
[1:46:27.800 --> 1:46:31.840]  each other that they really used double back and attack patriots with which
[1:46:31.840 --> 1:46:37.600]  they're now doing and I warned you how did I warn you the Pena document stated
[1:46:37.600 --> 1:46:42.000]  the plan like we're idiots and then they said we'll use race specific weapons to
[1:46:42.000 --> 1:46:46.440]  kill most the people after we've had this clash the clash is to put the the
[1:46:46.440 --> 1:46:53.080]  electronic spy drone kill grid in once once Skynet and that's their pentagon
[1:46:53.080 --> 1:46:56.200]  word that's not from them from the Terminator series they used a pentagon
[1:46:56.200 --> 1:47:01.640]  term once from 1977 once Skynet is in place once the digital skin is
[1:47:01.640 --> 1:47:04.760]  in place they're putting the proper drugs in the water to control us they're
[1:47:04.760 --> 1:47:07.920]  actually wearing battle planning this is all public they write books about it
[1:47:07.920 --> 1:47:11.920]  it's a listen they're basically like an off-world group of aliens but they're
[1:47:11.920 --> 1:47:17.720]  humans they might as well be oblivion they might as well be the black pyramid
[1:47:17.720 --> 1:47:21.480]  they might as well be the red eye of Soron they believe that's what they're
[1:47:21.480 --> 1:47:25.280]  going to become and you can say well they're channeling Satan that is an
[1:47:25.280 --> 1:47:29.080]  off-world entity but that's pretty much what it is I've analyzed this so long
[1:47:29.080 --> 1:47:33.280]  I'll just tell you Satan's real folks it's a black frickin pyramid that that
[1:47:33.280 --> 1:47:38.080]  that's what I envision in my mind is Satan six eight months ago and that's
[1:47:38.080 --> 1:47:42.120]  what other people envision as the pure evil the dehumanizing technocratic
[1:47:42.120 --> 1:47:46.720]  complete takeover and the end of humanity as we know it taking its time to
[1:47:46.720 --> 1:47:50.840]  grow the artificial skin compartmentalizing everybody and again
[1:47:50.840 --> 1:47:54.200]  whether you believe in God the devil whatever humans are manifesting the
[1:47:54.200 --> 1:47:58.480]  technocrats believe that they're gonna dumb us down create the world government
[1:47:58.480 --> 1:48:02.520]  orderly exterminate us while always saying it's terrorists or other groups
[1:48:02.520 --> 1:48:06.400]  that did it I mean do you see what I'm saying sir it's a battle-gritted war
[1:48:06.400 --> 1:48:12.200]  game giant program all sliced and dialed and prepared and notice it's all
[1:48:12.200 --> 1:48:16.200]  rolling out just as I said it would do you see what I'm saying oh yeah
[1:48:16.200 --> 1:48:20.160]  absolutely and I just once again I have to validate that because if a new
[1:48:20.160 --> 1:48:22.840]  listener is listening to you talk about these things and they can seem so
[1:48:22.840 --> 1:48:27.520]  shocking but I'm telling you once you start to wake up to the paradigm that
[1:48:27.520 --> 1:48:31.360]  we are all in like in our minds and our perception you're gonna start to make
[1:48:31.360 --> 1:48:35.720]  connections and you're gonna start to understand how some of these things come
[1:48:35.720 --> 1:48:38.920]  about I mean you've done such an awesome job of showing people how false
[1:48:38.920 --> 1:48:44.000]  like tears happen throughout history and how central banks have done so much to
[1:48:44.000 --> 1:48:49.600]  enslave humanity and folks until you you can't just hear what Alex Jones has to
[1:48:49.600 --> 1:48:53.040]  say you've got to do your research you've got to start making connections in
[1:48:53.040 --> 1:48:57.960]  your own mind so that when you hear things others then from Alex Jones you're
[1:48:57.960 --> 1:49:00.280]  gonna start you're gonna start making those connections and things you're
[1:49:00.280 --> 1:49:04.520]  gonna validate themselves well listen I hope listeners are listening to me the
[1:49:04.520 --> 1:49:10.480]  government since the 20s and 30s has done declassified medical experiments
[1:49:10.480 --> 1:49:15.200]  where if a girl made a B plus on a paper below B plus they would sterilize them
[1:49:15.200 --> 1:49:18.160]  and they would do medical experiments on them while they did it sometimes just
[1:49:18.160 --> 1:49:22.240]  kill them listen I appreciate your call the globalists see themselves as
[1:49:22.240 --> 1:49:26.680]  technocrats they say that themselves I've been saying that for 15 years since I
[1:49:26.680 --> 1:49:30.640]  really discovered all this at a deeper level and now you notice the EU calls
[1:49:30.640 --> 1:49:34.040]  themselves technocrats because their books they call themselves this and they
[1:49:34.040 --> 1:49:37.760]  believe they're scientific and cold-blooded we're dumb animals we
[1:49:37.760 --> 1:49:41.840]  deserve to die they're really just people on crazy narcissistic power trips

[1:54:22.000 --> 1:54:26.920]  virtuous that's taught standard everywhere worldwide in the last hundred
[1:54:26.920 --> 1:54:31.480]  years because the robber barons took over education they are social Darwinists
[1:54:31.480 --> 1:54:34.600]  they believe your animals and they're doing the world a favor to kill you and
[1:54:34.600 --> 1:54:38.520]  if you buy into their programming you deserve it that's why Kesha and all these

[1:55:19.600 --> 1:55:23.280]  it's hurting the earth really the globalist are blocking real technological
[1:55:23.280 --> 1:55:28.600]  development that would help the earth they're the worst for the environment
[1:55:28.600 --> 1:55:31.640]  and they'll go well there are too many people and I go do you understand you're
[1:55:31.640 --> 1:55:37.200]  under attack too don't you get that that that you know this is going on I mean
[1:55:37.200 --> 1:55:40.200]  that's the message I want to get out there what you're seeing is the building
[1:55:40.200 --> 1:55:45.400]  of a world government to carry out the orderly forced population reduction by
[1:55:45.400 --> 1:55:50.640]  very accelerated bio weapon and chemical means and you're seeing the ambient
[1:55:50.640 --> 1:55:54.200]  background turned up as more and more people get sick and die right now and
[1:55:54.200 --> 1:56:02.600]  it's just going to get more and more and more insane very very quickly and I'm
[1:56:02.600 --> 1:56:07.480]  again this is the reality I can't lie to you they want to incrementally show you
[1:56:07.480 --> 1:56:12.640]  the reality so you titrate the dose how do people that handle snakes get used to
[1:56:12.640 --> 1:56:15.600]  being able to be bit by them they give them small amounts and build it up that's
[1:56:15.600 --> 1:56:19.160]  titrating the dose you're given more and more evil more and more evil more and
[1:56:19.160 --> 1:56:22.680]  more evil where they can be yeah we just take babies and throw them in toilets and
[1:56:22.680 --> 1:56:27.560]  yeah we kill foster kids with pesticides and yeah we torture people's kids in
[1:56:27.560 --> 1:56:31.240]  front of them but it's USA USA and yeah we're going to declare martial law over
[1:56:31.240 --> 1:56:35.360]  city and search all your houses and we're gonna burn donor down and lie to you
[1:56:35.360 --> 1:56:39.000]  about it and yeah we're gonna do forced inoculations and yeah we're gonna give
[1:56:39.000 --> 1:56:45.520]  no-bid contracts to congressman's wives for you know billions of dollars and we're
[1:56:45.520 --> 1:56:50.040]  gonna confiscate your guns but we're not gonna confiscate your guns and see now
[1:56:50.040 --> 1:56:52.760]  they've just got you where everybody's like well I guess they lie I don't know
[1:56:52.760 --> 1:56:59.000]  what the truth is I don't know what the and that's why I get so angry because
[1:56:59.000 --> 1:57:02.440]  I'm trying to shake people out of the complacency here because they've
[1:57:02.440 --> 1:57:07.520]  incrementally built it up built it up built it up built it up built it up
[1:57:07.520 --> 1:57:12.160]  built it up to where you know in the movies people find out they're in the
[1:57:12.160 --> 1:57:15.240]  matrix or they find out they're an oblivion and they wake up and do
[1:57:15.240 --> 1:57:20.560]  something but you know I mean take the oblivion plot line instead of Tom
[1:57:20.560 --> 1:57:23.080]  Cruz finding out what's really going on and firing against it he'd be like well
[1:57:23.080 --> 1:57:26.080]  I guess I'll just try to live out as a slave of this thing that's gonna kill
[1:57:26.080 --> 1:57:29.720]  everybody just because I feel like I'm on the winning team it might kill me in
[1:57:29.720 --> 1:57:34.840]  10 weeks but you know I want to imagine I'm with the winning team because that's
[1:57:34.840 --> 1:57:42.760]  really what would happen I mean you are under attack pure evil once you get a
[1:57:42.760 --> 1:57:46.240]  tyranny in place only the most evil can be allowed to get into the position of
[1:57:46.240 --> 1:57:50.000]  power the top of the pyramid you can have somebody really bad but as soon as
[1:57:50.000 --> 1:57:53.960]  somebody else even worse gets in they'll get in and then they'll get in
[1:57:53.960 --> 1:58:00.640]  they'll get in until you get absolute crystalline pure unadulterated death in
[1:58:00.640 --> 1:58:05.040]  control what's at the bottom of the rabbit hole illuminati death what's at
[1:58:05.040 --> 1:58:10.280]  the bottom of God's rabbit hole eternal life just just accelerated intelligence

[1:58:17.920 --> 1:58:25.880]  everything transcendent everything the poetry flowing versus people stomping
[1:58:25.880 --> 1:58:29.920]  around bugging their eyes out wearing black uniforms trying to reflect the
[1:58:29.920 --> 1:58:34.360]  darkness you're not even the darkness you try to reflect it like a moth to

[2:00:37.920 --> 2:00:42.280]  Congress be part of the narrative like their victims too that's a script and I
[2:00:42.280 --> 2:00:45.240]  told you that would end up being fake they always have multiple patsies they'll
[2:00:45.240 --> 2:00:48.640]  probably kill the third patsy for some reason they're pathological big sis
[2:00:48.640 --> 2:00:52.000]  pushes citizenship for illegals politico immigration law would secure
[2:00:52.000 --> 2:00:57.240]  democratic victories for generation electoral shift tying it to a racial
[2:00:57.240 --> 2:01:04.240]  system tying it to socialism tying it to the globalist conquering of America
[2:01:04.240 --> 2:01:08.720]  that's what that is divide and conquer Shelly thanks for holding you want to
[2:01:08.720 --> 2:01:13.520]  talk about gun control and martial law thank you for joining us go ahead hey
[2:01:13.520 --> 2:01:20.600]  Alex Jones got a question for you this is about population control I remember
[2:01:20.600 --> 2:01:24.680]  you and Joel Scalfs and talking about the government's need to disarm the
[2:01:24.680 --> 2:01:28.600]  country and they get as many on welfare as possible before they drop the hammer
[2:01:28.600 --> 2:01:35.720]  on the citizens so my question is about one of those hammers would you agree
[2:01:35.720 --> 2:01:42.960]  that there is a connection between the DHS buildup and the race for martial law
[2:01:42.960 --> 2:01:48.440]  and the common icing that astrophysicist James McKinney says has the
[2:01:48.440 --> 2:01:52.880]  risk of sending the EMP and knocking out our grid system causing all kind of
[2:01:52.880 --> 2:01:59.120]  chaos and mass deaths over time and the government's need to maintain as much
[2:01:59.120 --> 2:02:06.000]  control as possible before this event occurs well man there's a lot of people
[2:02:06.000 --> 2:02:10.000]  worried about EMPs they try to predict them or solar flares they do happen it
[2:02:10.000 --> 2:02:14.120]  is a threat but it's always right around the corner and so it's basically used
[2:02:14.120 --> 2:02:17.200]  as a way to always always the end of the world you know so what why should I be
[2:02:17.200 --> 2:02:22.560]  involved anyways so that's what I see on that front basically the government's
[2:02:22.560 --> 2:02:26.080]  gearing up with all this police state because they've already stolen all the
[2:02:26.080 --> 2:02:29.200]  money they're bringing in a world government we're being cold-bloodily
[2:02:29.200 --> 2:02:32.640]  conquered right now and they're going to bring in populations from all over the
[2:02:32.640 --> 2:02:36.720]  world that are accustomed to living as slaves who will then accept you know
[2:02:36.720 --> 2:02:41.560]  being slaves America is going into bondage because the New World Order is
[2:02:41.560 --> 2:02:46.680]  all about global slavery global bondage and they can't have any you know of us
[2:02:46.680 --> 2:02:52.280]  being free when everybody else's slaves okay so you don't really think that this
[2:02:52.280 --> 2:02:58.240]  is a peripheral issue with this common icing absolutely it's pure crap okay
[2:02:58.240 --> 2:03:01.800]  all right no but I'm glad you brought that up I mean I mean they have real
[2:03:01.800 --> 2:03:05.480]  asteroids real comments that come by real things hit us but you're just
[2:03:05.480 --> 2:03:08.440]  always hearing it's the end of the world with 2012 and it's always the other
[2:03:08.440 --> 2:03:12.240]  way and it's just like it's a serialized deal people do it's the end of
[2:03:12.240 --> 2:03:16.160]  humanity happening incrementally right now it's the slow death that's hard to
[2:03:16.160 --> 2:03:20.680]  beat our shields are up for the big frontal assault it's the it's the it's
[2:03:20.680 --> 2:03:25.480]  the slow knife that slips through our shield
[2:03:28.000 --> 2:03:33.720]  you understand what I'm saying thank you for the call ma'am and don't think I'm
[2:03:33.720 --> 2:03:37.840]  poo-poo and you for bringing that up I'm glad you brought it up Lucy in

[2:09:31.320 --> 2:09:34.480]  generational shift and guaranteed democratic takeover of everything it's

[2:10:51.960 --> 2:10:57.600]  that point and good people are standing down and criminality is just
[2:10:57.600 --> 2:11:03.920]  overrunning us at every level let's go ahead and go to your calls Paul in
[2:11:03.920 --> 2:11:09.680]  Ontario Canada you're on the air thanks for holding yeah I kind of got into a
[2:11:09.680 --> 2:11:17.720]  ranting mood today I noticed anyways you got a post up on info wars it was a
[2:11:17.720 --> 2:11:21.640]  link to the opening Anthony show I just an innocuous clip end of listening at
[2:11:21.640 --> 2:11:26.120]  the 250 mark while this by witnesses recounting his experience you hear
[2:11:26.120 --> 2:11:31.440]  police radio in the background yeah I noticed that I don't even know why
[2:11:31.440 --> 2:11:34.640]  Steve Watson I think he was updating this morning even put that up I mean
[2:11:34.640 --> 2:11:38.400]  because it says I witness you know recounts and I it's funny I listened to it
[2:11:38.400 --> 2:11:43.760]  this morning and it sounds like a cop putting on an official story and we've
[2:11:43.760 --> 2:11:46.280]  seen a lot of that because there's a lot of other witnesses saying they ran over
[2:11:46.280 --> 2:11:51.880]  the guy with the car they shot him up and things like that and so yeah you're
[2:11:51.880 --> 2:11:56.320]  right I actually heard that in there and I remember noticing and I was driving in
[2:11:56.320 --> 2:11:59.960]  in the morning listening to that clip I had plugged into my dash listening to
[2:11:59.960 --> 2:12:04.640]  the YouTube video and I heard that as well yeah about the four minute mark
[2:12:04.640 --> 2:12:07.800]  there's another point where he says that and this was the support this was a show
[2:12:07.800 --> 2:12:11.280]  was on Monday and the event was Friday right there's one point where he says
[2:12:11.280 --> 2:12:15.840]  oh my truck is probably riddled with bullet holes what did you you couldn't
[2:12:15.840 --> 2:12:19.720]  go a title Friday so you decided not to go to Sunday or Monday morning he didn't
[2:12:19.720 --> 2:12:23.840]  drive he didn't go check on his car you know it's funny and I'm also bashing on
[2:12:23.840 --> 2:12:28.760]  the clip which I don't if I don't mind I didn't listen to the whole thing but I
[2:12:28.760 --> 2:12:33.440]  did notice all that yes sir I did notice that it meant to make a note of it in
[2:12:33.440 --> 2:12:37.840]  fact I'll give people the exact headline I think it's like witness to shoot out
[2:12:37.840 --> 2:12:45.520]  or it'll be in the archive the featured news archive link guys there and I'll
[2:12:45.520 --> 2:12:49.600]  come show you where it is anything else you said I just figured some of the
[2:12:49.600 --> 2:12:53.960]  piece of the puzzle why not throw it out there right yeah I I actually thought I
[2:12:53.960 --> 2:12:57.440]  heard that what you said I'm just so busy I never even checked into it so it
[2:12:57.440 --> 2:13:01.960]  looks like even though I mean maybe Steve Watson was trying to quote show both
[2:13:01.960 --> 2:13:04.840]  sides I don't know because we had witnesses up there yesterday saying they
[2:13:04.840 --> 2:13:07.680]  you know laid him out basically shot him up and ran the car over him but
[2:13:07.680 --> 2:13:10.560]  government wouldn't do that I mean they do medical experiments on little kids
[2:13:10.560 --> 2:13:15.680]  and murder them but that's loving in fact I maybe we should have a national day
[2:13:15.680 --> 2:13:20.440]  of thanks for all the troops the government nerve-gassed to death in
[2:13:20.440 --> 2:13:25.280]  different programs like porting down and and projects Shad and other stuff I
[2:13:25.280 --> 2:13:30.400]  mean yeah there it is eyewitness describes Watertown shootout and guys go
[2:13:30.400 --> 2:13:35.240]  to the two what is it 250 mark you said yeah 253 minutes there's a police radio
[2:13:35.240 --> 2:13:39.640]  going on about four minutes is where he makes our mark about his car yeah well
[2:13:39.640 --> 2:13:46.080]  the police don't engage in psyops so I I you know I think we should worship
[2:13:46.080 --> 2:13:50.680]  government thank you for the call very extreme phone call there I mean we all
[2:13:50.680 --> 2:13:54.240]  heard the police say let's burn his cabin down burn that down burn that
[2:13:54.240 --> 2:13:57.840]  bleeper down burn it down okay we're getting the fire to burn it down okay
[2:13:57.840 --> 2:14:02.880]  we're we're placing the fire it's ignited it's burning down but they but
[2:14:02.880 --> 2:14:05.720]  but first they said that those tapes weren't real and they said well they're
[2:14:05.720 --> 2:14:10.120]  real but we didn't mean that and everything's fine and again I say
[2:14:10.120 --> 2:14:14.600]  take more shots and drink more fluoride water and eat more GMO even though it
[2:14:14.600 --> 2:14:19.280]  kills the rats in the studies okay now Samuel in New Jersey you're on the year
[2:14:19.280 --> 2:14:23.880]  go ahead hey I haven't listened to you guys over the past couple days and I don't
[2:14:23.880 --> 2:14:27.840]  know if you notice this but if you look at the two pictures of Boston bombing
[2:14:27.840 --> 2:14:31.440]  suspects that they have with the backpacks on one of them has a great
[2:14:31.440 --> 2:14:35.040]  backpack the other one has a light backpack but the backpack with the bomb
[2:14:35.040 --> 2:14:38.880]  and it was black yep no no both the bombs were in black backpacks and we have
[2:14:38.880 --> 2:14:42.520]  people there at the scene with exact same backpacks and you had everybody there
[2:14:42.520 --> 2:14:45.680]  with black backpacks it was part of the drill so that nobody found the real bomb
[2:14:45.680 --> 2:14:51.760]  and then the CNN was quick to say well the they we sure they unzipped it with
[2:14:51.760 --> 2:14:54.920]  the pressure cooker though we're doing a behind-the-scenes study with that very
[2:14:54.920 --> 2:14:58.400]  pressure cooker looks like you couldn't cram it in there and then put it in
[2:14:58.400 --> 2:15:03.280]  another backpack plus they had small backpacks if the glove doesn't fit you
[2:15:03.280 --> 2:15:09.000]  must have quit yeah I'm another thing that I forgot to tell a while they were
[2:15:09.000 --> 2:15:13.720]  asking me what I was gonna say is there's actually more about the Federal Reserve
[2:15:13.720 --> 2:15:17.720]  I don't know if you ever heard of executive order 1110 yeah Kennedy signed
[2:15:17.720 --> 2:15:21.040]  it and one month later they blew us out off in front of everybody and they had
[2:15:21.040 --> 2:15:24.800]  guys lined up with guns like a firing squad and over a hundred people saw it
[2:15:24.800 --> 2:15:28.960]  and then so they murdered all those people and it's even on the on the film
[2:15:28.960 --> 2:15:33.720]  you see the poosa smoke and and you bet the grassy know I mean it's like 30
[2:15:33.720 --> 2:15:38.320]  yards to Kennedy and everybody saw it the policeman all ran up there but you
[2:15:38.320 --> 2:15:42.040]  know what government loves this sir I mean look the government again taking
[2:15:42.040 --> 2:15:46.400]  foster children and murdering them in radiation and pesticide test even just a
[2:15:46.400 --> 2:15:55.640]  few years ago is loving so they would never kill a president you know you I
[2:15:55.640 --> 2:16:00.640]  probably listen to you almost every day and I'm actually 14 years old and you
[2:16:00.640 --> 2:16:04.080]  know when I first started talking about stuff like this people you know it's kind
[2:16:04.080 --> 2:16:09.440]  of annoying or embarrassing but I just learned not to care anymore and or people
[2:16:09.440 --> 2:16:15.760]  and you know you probably have so many people that hate you or make fun of you
[2:16:15.760 --> 2:16:22.600]  or call you crazy stuff like this but you know no they're the ones that are
[2:16:22.600 --> 2:16:28.240]  crazy look at this CNS news story teacher sues school over suspension for
[2:16:28.240 --> 2:16:33.200]  weapons charge showing students gardening tools to teach him how to garden you
[2:16:33.200 --> 2:16:37.280]  know I mean I saw a story with a valoviktorian got her degree her
[2:16:37.280 --> 2:16:41.120]  diploma taken for a year had to go back to school because on the last day of
[2:16:41.120 --> 2:16:46.960]  school she brought a pie I think was key lime to school to go to her teachers
[2:16:46.960 --> 2:16:52.440]  after school party that's the teachers pet to cut it up and give pie but the
[2:16:52.440 --> 2:16:58.720]  good news is that the security guard walked by saw the plastic pixie butter
[2:16:58.720 --> 2:17:04.240]  knife and and and and made the arrest she and then I saw another case where it
[2:17:04.240 --> 2:17:08.680]  was salutatory and had a it was moving out that next day to go to college they
[2:17:08.680 --> 2:17:12.360]  were already getting into summer school college you know the salutatorian and she
[2:17:12.360 --> 2:17:17.920]  again had a set of knives forks and spoons with butter knives with a slightly
[2:17:17.920 --> 2:17:23.480]  serrated edge the security guard the slave guard saw that and the arrest was
[2:17:23.480 --> 2:17:28.320]  made hmm and of course we've all heard about those stories isn't that good sir
[2:17:28.320 --> 2:17:35.640]  you don't want to be an extremist do you you know like yeah I like any boy
[2:17:35.640 --> 2:17:42.280]  he's not hated done I don't understand why do we fail our generation with weapons
[2:17:42.280 --> 2:17:45.560]  I mean weapons so here's the deal none of it makes sense because it's not meant
[2:17:45.560 --> 2:17:51.640]  to psych warfare chiefs whose religion is eugenics are in control and they've
[2:17:51.640 --> 2:17:55.480]  got delusions of grandeur how they're going to merge with machines and live
[2:17:55.480 --> 2:17:58.680]  forever I don't know that's really gonna happen that's their public plan Ray
[2:17:58.680 --> 2:18:02.280]  Kurzweil all of them watch my film in-game blueprint for global enslavement
[2:18:02.280 --> 2:18:06.880]  all the big billionaires they're in the globalist club give tens of millions a
[2:18:06.880 --> 2:18:10.000]  year to these big laboratories and think tanks because when you got everything
[2:18:10.000 --> 2:18:13.800]  what do you want more life what is what does Roy Batty want at Tyrell
[2:18:13.800 --> 2:18:20.200]  corporation in Blade Runner what's he want what's he wants Samuel I don't know
[2:18:20.200 --> 2:18:26.840]  I want more life and then he adds an x-completive to it
[2:18:26.840 --> 2:18:32.360]  I mean I want it down to the balls and pump ringer and barbie guns like 50 bucks I
[2:18:32.360 --> 2:18:36.600]  go down to exploring good New Jersey do the things that be begun with a steady
[2:18:36.600 --> 2:18:41.600]  yard sugar guard with bulletproof glass on it so no one can get to the baby I
[2:18:41.600 --> 2:18:46.880]  need to be begun well no no no no citizens with the image of a gun must be
[2:18:46.880 --> 2:18:52.200]  illegalized illegalized I'm admitting words you know must be made illegal but
[2:18:52.200 --> 2:18:55.840]  then government armed to the teeth violating our rights that must be made
[2:18:55.840 --> 2:19:02.040]  the the ambrosia of liberty see USA USA liberty is a city under martial law with
[2:19:02.040 --> 2:19:05.520]  housewives being drug out at gunpoint and cops shoving them up against walls
[2:19:05.520 --> 2:19:09.480]  in the sacrament of power because they can shove you up against a wall they
[2:19:09.480 --> 2:19:12.600]  can take your kids and they can do that for no reason they can make you take
[2:19:12.600 --> 2:19:15.760]  shots and they can take your bank account because you're not needed anymore

[2:33:53.000 --> 2:34:02.400]  points as always how fast you move determines how long you live
[2:34:04.080 --> 2:34:12.520]  resistance to tyrants is obedience to God it's Alex Jones
[2:34:17.480 --> 2:34:21.480]  all right I don't want to spend all day on the film of living in then I saw last
[2:34:21.480 --> 2:34:24.600]  night I got a bunch of news to get to in your calls and I pretty much did the
[2:34:24.600 --> 2:34:28.400]  review in the first hour because I always talk about something coming up and
[2:34:28.400 --> 2:34:32.480]  then just do it right there on the spot because all the data is right there I'm
[2:34:32.480 --> 2:34:39.200]  not really a Tom Cruise fan and I know about him behind the scenes you know
[2:34:39.200 --> 2:34:41.760]  telling old friends and stuff I won't be your friend anymore unless you join
[2:34:41.760 --> 2:34:52.600]  Scientology but that that's separately the directors and the writers who wrote
[2:34:52.600 --> 2:35:01.080]  it together Joseph Kaczynski and Arvid Nelson most the reviews out there back
[2:35:01.080 --> 2:35:06.320]  printed off some of them right here come out and say that you know oblivion
[2:35:06.320 --> 2:35:10.400]  occupies an awkward no man's land between escape a space adventure and heavy
[2:35:10.400 --> 2:35:14.360]  science fiction but these are thrilling enough nor intellectually stimulating
[2:35:14.360 --> 2:35:20.320]  enough to satisfy devotees of either that's NPR coming from the black
[2:35:20.320 --> 2:35:25.520]  pyramid that's what I expected to say New York Post oblivion is one of those
[2:35:25.520 --> 2:35:30.640]  movies in which the main source of interest is simply in figuring out what's
[2:35:30.640 --> 2:35:37.760]  actually going on though when you do your reaction is bound to be a shrug it's
[2:35:37.760 --> 2:35:43.840]  pleasantly complicated head spinning plot based on the director Joseph Kaczynski's
[2:35:43.840 --> 2:35:50.440]  graphic novel is asking a little too much was cruise trying to beat out fellow
[2:35:50.440 --> 2:35:55.400]  Scientologist John Travolta for the honor of starring in the dumbest sci-fi
[2:35:55.400 --> 2:36:01.400]  epic ever I mean folks almost all the reviews are incredibly negative
[2:36:01.400 --> 2:36:08.200]  concerning oblivion and what I'm gonna do is because I recorded a bunch of
[2:36:08.200 --> 2:36:10.800]  points last night this morning that I wanted to write down and I only got to
[2:36:10.800 --> 2:36:15.080]  like one of the sheets and we're just running out of time here I got too much
[2:36:15.080 --> 2:36:19.680]  important news to cover I this movie just absolutely and I don't just say this
[2:36:19.680 --> 2:36:27.880]  I mean I study what the globalist right to say to the point of in I'm just not
[2:36:27.880 --> 2:36:31.240]  even knowing what to do anymore I mean they're open criminal operation against
[2:36:31.240 --> 2:36:37.600]  us is so diabolical so public so disgusting so crazy we're living in a
[2:36:37.600 --> 2:36:44.800]  science fiction movie and what do you think devil worshipers would do with a
[2:36:44.800 --> 2:36:48.120]  bunch of high technology they try to exterminate the majority of the public
[2:36:48.120 --> 2:36:55.320]  merge with machines to become gods that's it and that's the reason you see
[2:36:55.320 --> 2:37:05.400]  this in so many science fiction films and so many things is that is what
[2:37:05.400 --> 2:37:08.960]  they're into that's what they believe but usually it's done from a two-sided
[2:37:08.960 --> 2:37:15.480]  position like the Matrix and the Wachowski brothers this film and the
[2:37:15.480 --> 2:37:18.920]  and the two gentlemen that wrote it they've only been in Hollywood about six
[2:37:18.920 --> 2:37:24.000]  seven years I've done a lot of really impressive work there it's their graphic
[2:37:24.000 --> 2:37:27.040]  talent that brought them to the point of being able to put out their first major
[2:37:27.040 --> 2:37:33.480]  film and it's a tour de force it is a anti-aluminati tour de force and people
[2:37:33.480 --> 2:37:39.360]  just do not get the art types I mean I remember when episode 3 came out revenge
[2:37:39.360 --> 2:37:43.640]  of the Sith which again those were cheesy movies for children you know you
[2:37:43.640 --> 2:37:46.080]  know I'm more a fan of the cheesy dialogue you know kind of like I'm a fan
[2:37:46.080 --> 2:37:49.160]  of airplane you know it's not like I'm saying it's some great thing it's just
[2:37:49.160 --> 2:37:54.560]  it the art type senator important though even in something like airplane you
[2:37:54.560 --> 2:37:59.760]  know from a comedy perspective the art types in episode 3 are the best of all
[2:37:59.760 --> 2:38:04.640]  the films this senator has become the head of the Senate by staging terror
[2:38:04.640 --> 2:38:11.960]  attacks on himself and then he uses the police state to wipe out the Jedi and in
[2:38:11.960 --> 2:38:16.040]  the Republic that's and then I saw the film and couldn't believe it and then
[2:38:16.040 --> 2:38:20.320]  Lucas came out and talked about it and said this is what's really going on with
[2:38:20.320 --> 2:38:25.280]  9-11 obviously a 9-11 truther you say what you want about Lucas you know he's
[2:38:25.280 --> 2:38:30.200]  a big fan of THX 1138 well he made THX 1138 that's kind of a remake adaptation
[2:38:30.200 --> 2:38:35.160]  a brave new world which is actually a real transhumanist globalist plan 1932
[2:38:35.160 --> 2:38:40.280]  Aldous Huxley carried out by the main head of the World Eugenics Society
[2:38:40.280 --> 2:38:43.920]  Julian Huxley his brother to later be the head of the United Nations UNESCO
[2:38:43.920 --> 2:38:48.720]  program which is the real head of the UN that's the eugenics department for
[2:38:48.720 --> 2:38:54.480]  world standardization for his 2021 projects so exhausting to know I mean
[2:38:54.480 --> 2:38:58.480]  it's like I start talking about this and thousands of data points open up as the
[2:38:58.480 --> 2:39:02.480]  frustration so they believe that they're gonna become God men they believe
[2:39:02.480 --> 2:39:09.320]  they're setting all this up and they're following 150 hundred and 1850s is when
[2:39:09.320 --> 2:39:14.920]  this was hatched so 160 plus years they are following a program hatched by
[2:39:14.920 --> 2:39:25.320]  Galton spun off from Malthus Sir Malthus and picked up then kind of in the age of
[2:39:25.320 --> 2:39:32.600]  science fiction projecting with a Fabian socialist what could be possible and
[2:39:32.600 --> 2:39:37.920]  then what man imagines man can later build and they've come to the consensus
[2:39:37.920 --> 2:39:41.720]  as so many of their writers have talked about I talked about why the future
[2:39:41.720 --> 2:39:47.280]  doesn't need us a lot and wired magazine in April 2000 Bill Joy talked about it
[2:39:47.280 --> 2:39:50.280]  hundreds of times because you can go read that he goes to a globalist conference
[2:39:50.280 --> 2:39:54.240]  there's 200 top tech people there they have a discussion do we kill everybody
[2:39:54.240 --> 2:39:58.600]  that's better for the earth or do we let people just play video games all day
[2:39:58.600 --> 2:40:03.560]  and become fat blobs like Wally you know where it's a computerized system taking
[2:40:03.560 --> 2:40:07.280]  care of people that can't even walk and that's where it's going no they're not
[2:40:07.280 --> 2:40:10.800]  going to put you in the trance state so you can drink pina coladas on the deck of
[2:40:10.800 --> 2:40:18.120]  a star cruiser they're already killing us the decision has been made and they're
[2:40:18.120 --> 2:40:23.640]  going towards a hotter program and by a hotter program a faster program and I
[2:40:23.640 --> 2:40:27.120]  know I just keep like an emergency beacon going emergency emergency
[2:40:27.120 --> 2:40:32.200]  emergency to the point of I just can't be around people who don't take this
[2:40:32.200 --> 2:40:37.360]  serious anymore and you know what I could become really aggressive too and
[2:40:37.360 --> 2:40:41.680]  everything because I'm in combat ladies and gentlemen I know I'm right and it is
[2:40:41.680 --> 2:40:45.400]  so exhausting to care about humanity to care about you and your family to care
[2:40:45.400 --> 2:40:48.960]  about you and your children because I just want survival I mean I'm right
[2:40:48.960 --> 2:40:53.440]  about this and you you have to make the decision to research it so you know what's
[2:40:53.440 --> 2:41:02.760]  going on everyone I know all over the country has been sick for a year I have
[2:41:02.760 --> 2:41:06.960]  seen more sickness in people I know and people in town everyone they know in the
[2:41:06.960 --> 2:41:09.880]  last eight months and it's same and then and there's numbers out I've got
[2:41:09.880 --> 2:41:14.800]  numbers out the deaths the obesity the sickness the the the allergies the
[2:41:14.800 --> 2:41:21.360]  they're killing us exactly what you see first-generation rodents fed one GMO
[2:41:21.360 --> 2:41:28.640]  crop every GMO crop does this that's cross species or well they're all
[2:41:28.640 --> 2:41:33.600]  cross species that produce their own poison I mean you know let me explain
[2:41:33.600 --> 2:41:38.560]  something if bees can't eat the pollen off a corn plant because it kills them
[2:41:38.560 --> 2:41:41.640]  because it grows its own pesticide but you're supposed to be able to eat that
[2:41:41.640 --> 2:41:47.160]  I mean most of our livers are the size of baby stingrays right now I mean we are
[2:41:47.160 --> 2:41:52.120]  under mega attack ladies and gentlemen and I am just a desperate primitive
[2:41:52.120 --> 2:41:55.920]  human and by primitive that's more advanced than what we are now I'm just
[2:41:55.920 --> 2:42:00.280]  a primitive person with life force directives that is just sitting here
[2:42:00.280 --> 2:42:05.440]  going oh my god they're openly admitting this whole program and then I see
[2:42:05.440 --> 2:42:15.880]  something like oblivion that the more I I mean just every 30 seconds was a
[2:42:15.880 --> 2:42:23.840]  different archetype message and it was all positive and it was about rebirth
[2:42:23.840 --> 2:42:29.240]  and regeneration and you know the children but also in the genetics
[2:42:29.240 --> 2:42:35.040]  they're being memories which has been proven and the cold-blooded psychopath
[2:42:35.040 --> 2:42:45.720]  system versus love and the soul and how compartmentalization is used to
[2:42:45.720 --> 2:43:01.880]  control everybody and it is just it is just beyond insane and I just feel an
[2:43:01.880 --> 2:43:08.720]  overriding responsibility to try to stop this I mean I can hardly be around my
[2:43:08.720 --> 2:43:14.840]  children because they're so innocent they're so good and it doesn't even make
[2:43:14.840 --> 2:43:20.680]  me angry when I think about the new world order now it is so evil and and most
[2:43:20.680 --> 2:43:24.400]  the people that are part of it are just ego maniacs on power trips and I think
[2:43:24.400 --> 2:43:27.560]  about how the technocrats have done this through compartmentalization through
[2:43:27.560 --> 2:43:31.680]  testing and they're able to see what people do in local departments to then
[2:43:31.680 --> 2:43:35.240]  promote them to state and then federal that international and when you get to
[2:43:35.240 --> 2:43:39.360]  the top of the pyramid they just write books about us talking about how we're
[2:43:39.360 --> 2:43:42.960]  animals they're gonna kill and then I even talked to yuppies they go yeah we
[2:43:42.960 --> 2:43:47.440]  are dumb ugly animals humanity's ugly and dumb and we need to die and I said
[2:43:47.440 --> 2:43:50.520]  but if I right now tried to kill you you would fight for your life and call the
[2:43:50.520 --> 2:43:55.040]  police and they don't even know what to say they're like I say I say this to
[2:43:55.040 --> 2:43:58.280]  people like are you threatening me and I go don't be an intellectual dimwit
[2:43:58.280 --> 2:44:02.760]  you're supposed to be this big smart liberal who's really authoritarian you
[2:44:02.760 --> 2:44:05.720]  know you just said we all need to die but you're gonna fight if I attack you
[2:44:05.720 --> 2:44:10.480]  right well of course I am I go well then why have you bought into something you
[2:44:10.480 --> 2:44:15.800]  you don't just say you're part of this and then not really be part of it
[2:44:15.800 --> 2:44:20.880]  but plus you're not part of it I mean how many times how many different ways
[2:44:20.880 --> 2:44:30.000]  do I have to say this to you I mean the globalist are opening the borders up to
[2:44:30.000 --> 2:44:32.880]  the entire collapsed world that they have collapsed with their policies
[2:44:32.880 --> 2:44:37.120]  bringing in people with no history of freedom to say you get your freedom by
[2:44:37.120 --> 2:44:40.560]  bringing down the Second Amendment that is taught now as a sacrament to look to
[2:44:40.560 --> 2:44:43.320]  Latin Americans coming in that you're gonna have your victory over the
[2:44:43.320 --> 2:44:47.880]  gringos when you get their guns when it should be hey if you want to come to
[2:44:47.880 --> 2:44:51.760]  America that's one thing the government isn't your friend we you you deserve
[2:44:51.760 --> 2:44:56.520]  guns you deserve freedom but they're tying their rebellion and their liberty
[2:44:56.520 --> 2:45:05.120]  to taking everybody's guns and America being like Mexico or Nigeria just like
[2:45:05.120 --> 2:45:09.880]  they're tying USA USA America to having your hands up at your house and being
[2:45:09.880 --> 2:45:13.960]  treated like a slave and having the cops you know slam your wife up against the
[2:45:13.960 --> 2:45:20.080]  wall just so they could exercise power and basically plant the flag on Boston
[2:45:20.720 --> 2:45:25.560]  you see the new civil right is giving up all your liberties the new civil right
[2:45:25.560 --> 2:45:28.760]  is being a slave
[2:45:28.760 --> 2:45:36.520]  people can be taught to love their servitude as Aldous Huxley said in 1962 at
[2:45:36.520 --> 2:45:42.960]  Berkeley and they have been and it's it's just disgusting you're taught to be
[2:45:42.960 --> 2:45:46.880]  a totally domesticated jellyfish you who can't even play with a water gun your
[2:45:46.880 --> 2:45:50.920]  dad has his guns taken when there's not even a law they just do it that's called
[2:45:50.920 --> 2:45:55.120]  martial law and but then the police can come around and come to your door and
[2:45:55.120 --> 2:45:59.380]  you open it and they point guns at you and shove you up against the wall when
[2:45:59.380 --> 2:46:06.960]  you're a black guy or you're a blonde guy I watched countless videos of somebody
[2:46:06.960 --> 2:46:10.120]  go out to their car to get something and the cops would run up and shove them
[2:46:10.120 --> 2:46:13.880]  up against the deal and the guy would go like hey obviously look nothing like
[2:46:13.880 --> 2:46:17.480]  the suspect and the cop would slam their head into the car it's just a police
[2:46:17.480 --> 2:46:21.360]  riot people driving around they've always wanted to beat everybody up now
[2:46:21.360 --> 2:46:25.160]  they can come into everybody's neighborhood and do it mentally ill people
[2:46:25.160 --> 2:46:31.960]  mentally ill mentally ill they never get tired of dominating people they never
[2:46:31.960 --> 2:46:35.400]  get tired of bullying people they never get tired they never get tired they
[2:46:35.400 --> 2:46:42.880]  never get tired and that's what this is all about it's about turning loose at
[2:46:42.880 --> 2:46:48.440]  every nobody and giving them government power to make us their slaves and again
[2:46:48.440 --> 2:46:53.520]  all at the proviso not all police are bad no but in areas where they've got
[2:46:53.520 --> 2:46:57.400]  control they can get away with anything and they are getting away and then
[2:46:57.400 --> 2:47:02.040]  Bloomberg an obvious craven scumbag running around saying we got to get rid
[2:47:02.040 --> 2:47:08.520]  of the Constitution to keep you safe the Constitution is what has produced any
[2:47:08.520 --> 2:47:12.800]  bit of liberty we have or a man just can't be disappeared because the emperor
[2:47:12.800 --> 2:47:20.840]  says take him away now let's go to this clip of Janet Polatano being asked by
[2:47:20.840 --> 2:47:24.840]  senator Ted Cruz I got to say Ted Cruz was even ready to come on the show when
[2:47:24.840 --> 2:47:29.680]  he was running for Senate and I didn't like some of some of the things he did
[2:47:29.680 --> 2:47:34.320]  in state government so even though I hated the guy who was running against
[2:47:34.320 --> 2:47:38.440]  I I didn't have him on we interviewed him at the Capitol so it was on the
[2:47:38.440 --> 2:47:42.240]  nightly news but I tell you I I'm as impressed with what he's been doing as
[2:47:42.240 --> 2:47:47.400]  I've been with Rand Paul I mean I just trust I get Ted Cruz only probably too
[2:47:47.400 --> 2:47:51.520]  too good for us now I'm joking as people say don't go on the radical show I was
[2:47:51.520 --> 2:47:54.560]  scared to get Rand Paul back I know Ron Paul's on I think what Ron Paul's on
[2:47:54.560 --> 2:48:04.960]  Thursday but I'm really impressed with Ted Cruz and let's go but let's go ahead
[2:48:04.960 --> 2:48:09.520]  and see if Janet's read the 800 page bill here it is I office received the
[2:48:09.520 --> 2:48:17.480]  text of this bill at 2 25 a.m. on Wednesday April 17th five days ago the
[2:48:17.480 --> 2:48:26.800]  bill is 844 pages long it is dealing with a very complicated topic and my
[2:48:26.800 --> 2:48:34.520]  first question is when did did did your office receive a copy of the bill as
[2:48:34.520 --> 2:48:40.080]  filed about three o'clock in the morning I think that's about right in the five
[2:48:40.080 --> 2:48:44.560]  days since then when you have obviously been heavily focused on matters such as
[2:48:44.560 --> 2:48:49.440]  the Boston bombing and quite properly focused on on matters such as that have
[2:48:49.440 --> 2:48:55.600]  you had the time to read all 844 pages of the bill actually I have read the
[2:48:55.600 --> 2:49:01.040]  bill I know many sections of the bill fairly well so I was able to skim
[2:49:01.040 --> 2:49:05.600]  those sections but I have been able to review the bill yes sir well okay then
[2:49:05.600 --> 2:49:12.320]  then that has been a busy weekend for you total bull yes sir very busy oh yes
[2:49:12.320 --> 2:49:18.320]  that was a busy with the stuff that goes on at your house I bet oh we know what

[2:54:24.800 --> 2:54:28.720]  horrible criminals that need to be bound down by the Constitution as the
[2:54:28.720 --> 2:54:33.880]  founders said and I know that all of the good of this country is bleeding out and

[2:54:43.120 --> 2:54:48.200]  take it easy and their slaves so if you don't like aggressive men that get angry
[2:54:48.200 --> 2:54:53.160]  about becoming slaves you don't want to be an American that's what it comes down
[2:54:53.160 --> 2:54:57.360]  to there's breaking news and info words dot com bunch of breaking news I said I
[2:54:57.360 --> 2:55:03.000]  go to calls let's go to Clint no who's all the longest Marty and Mass you're on
[2:55:03.000 --> 2:55:10.160]  the air go ahead listening on XM 166 hey Alex hey bro hey what's up keep on the
[2:55:10.160 --> 2:55:16.160]  Patriots yeah I could say that I just heard you briefly said I just heard the
[2:55:16.160 --> 2:55:24.600]  Congress their wife contact contract a spy on the American people and the
[2:55:24.600 --> 2:55:31.360]  liberal left may be do the same thing if she goes on XM 168 have you heard a
[2:55:31.360 --> 2:55:38.360]  rainy road she might be do the same thing spy on on the individual well I
[2:55:38.360 --> 2:55:42.160]  mean they use computers to do it there's a bunch of members of Congress whose
[2:55:42.160 --> 2:55:47.640]  wives and husbands and David Knight listed some of the day in a report where
[2:55:47.640 --> 2:55:52.440]  companies they head up get you know in one case ten billion dollar contract and
[2:55:52.440 --> 2:55:55.560]  then who knows what they'll get out of that probably you know 50 million a
[2:55:55.560 --> 2:55:59.400]  hundred million who knows but usually you know those type of numbers I mean
[2:55:59.400 --> 2:56:04.920]  again insider trading they passed a law saying they could insider trades they
[2:56:04.920 --> 2:56:08.760]  pass another law saying well if we get a waiver we can from the from their own
[2:56:08.760 --> 2:56:12.480]  ethics committee and then the head of the ethics committees wife is involved in
[2:56:12.480 --> 2:56:17.160]  this stuff and then now they got another law passed getting rid of that so
[2:56:17.160 --> 2:56:21.360]  they're back to insider trading I mean they do stuff let's be let's not
[2:56:21.360 --> 2:56:29.280]  exaggerate 5,000 times I mean just infinitely bigger than what Martha
[2:56:29.280 --> 2:56:34.520]  Stewart did and they don't go to jail that's what I mean I mean they're
[2:56:34.520 --> 2:56:39.000]  crooks they've gotten away with everything and now we're wondering why
[2:56:39.000 --> 2:56:43.880]  they're getting away with even more because we're Thomas Jefferson said
[2:56:43.880 --> 2:56:49.400]  the level of tyranny you will live under is the exact amount you will accept
[2:56:49.400 --> 2:56:53.320]  that's a Thomas Jefferson quote and that's exactly true God bless you I
[2:56:53.320 --> 2:56:58.680]  appreciate your call Jim in Arkansas you're on the air certain Alex been
[2:56:58.680 --> 2:57:04.280]  listening to you since we 15 years ago when we get your shortwave only it's great
[2:57:04.280 --> 2:57:10.080]  to talk to you I got a few things I'll go through real quick and if you would
[2:57:10.080 --> 2:57:15.680]  maybe comment on some of them I noticed on the Texas explosion down there the
[2:57:15.680 --> 2:57:21.360]  first word I heard of it to be ATF was already there to get to the bottom of
[2:57:21.360 --> 2:57:25.960]  that well they got to the bottom of Fast and Furious in Oklahoma City bless their
[2:57:25.960 --> 2:57:30.640]  little hearts when I saw it I thought well we'll we'll get the truth out of
[2:57:30.640 --> 2:57:34.440]  that pretty quick and then the other thing it's bothering me for quite some
[2:57:34.440 --> 2:57:38.080]  time about the by the way I don't know how I do it I said this guy's a patsy
[2:57:38.080 --> 2:57:44.680]  mailing the the the poison the Ryerson and I said watch they'll they'll arrest
[2:57:44.680 --> 2:57:48.200]  two or three more by the time they're done and that's now happened I mean they
[2:57:48.200 --> 2:57:53.960]  look they follow handbooks I'm sorry go ahead it's scripted it's all scripted
[2:57:53.960 --> 2:57:58.800]  the other thing is that I've given all my Constitution book that's the way that
[2:57:58.800 --> 2:58:03.440]  I got from you but doesn't the Constitution allow for the Congress to
[2:58:03.440 --> 2:58:13.880]  to mark people which is a you know it takes an act of Congress to to
[2:58:13.880 --> 2:58:18.880]  designate someone in me of the state and to deal with them isn't that included
[2:58:18.880 --> 2:58:23.800]  yes yes a wonderful document yes and then and then and instead they've
[2:58:23.800 --> 2:58:27.040]  handed that authority over to the bureaucracy which they're not allowed
[2:58:27.040 --> 2:58:33.100]  to do you can't do that you can't you can't number one you have to have a
[2:58:33.100 --> 2:58:36.880]  constitutional convention to do that okay they can't just pass the law doing
[2:58:36.880 --> 2:58:46.280]  that it's unconstitutional thank you for listening to GCN

[3:00:12.760 --> 3:00:20.280]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[3:00:20.280 --> 3:00:34.440]  Alex Jones over the weekend I shot a video called black butterflies lie and
[3:00:34.440 --> 3:00:38.320]  people thought I was smoking marijuana because it was 420 no I didn't smoke any
[3:00:38.320 --> 3:00:43.520]  marijuana or they think I'm drunk no I had had nothing to drink though I think
[3:00:43.520 --> 3:00:47.480]  I went inside had one glass of wine after this it's called poetry that came
[3:00:47.480 --> 3:00:53.640]  to mind very quickly where we were burning a piece of old furniture that
[3:00:53.640 --> 3:00:57.440]  we found down in the gully that I guess the last owner of my house little farm
[3:00:57.440 --> 3:01:02.240]  house had had it was a rotten piece of furniture so we made a little fire out
[3:01:02.240 --> 3:01:06.200]  in the backyard and burned it and some other stuff as the kids wanted to make
[3:01:06.200 --> 3:01:09.480]  a fire outside it was real pretty spring day and had just been raining the day
[3:01:09.480 --> 3:01:13.520]  before so it was safe to have a fire it's been so dry and my son found a big
[3:01:13.520 --> 3:01:16.760]  piece of cardboard that had blown off the road over the bar bar fence into the
[3:01:16.760 --> 3:01:21.960]  yard he said can I throw this on and I said yeah burn it and it it created all
[3:01:21.960 --> 3:01:24.600]  these little black pieces that you see go up in the sky but they're like
[3:01:24.600 --> 3:01:29.000]  butterflies so I shot a quick iPhone saying oh black butterflies the
[3:01:29.000 --> 3:01:32.600]  government says so and then I cut to the fact that it's really soot out of the
[3:01:32.600 --> 3:01:40.520]  fire and people are in there not even understanding what I'm saying some do
[3:01:40.520 --> 3:01:47.200]  and it's such a pure easy to understand allegory or analogy I mean come on and
[3:01:47.200 --> 3:01:51.200]  some people don't get I mean I really makes me wonder sometimes people don't
[3:01:51.200 --> 3:01:54.920]  get a video I shot last night driving home at about seven well I was driving
[3:01:54.920 --> 3:01:59.480]  meet my dad to watch a oblivion called who says the stars only come out at night
[3:01:59.480 --> 3:02:05.640]  and I shot that on my iPhone because it was so yellow the sky the camera didn't
[3:02:05.640 --> 3:02:08.800]  pick it up made it more blue the whole sky was like yellow and orange and it
[3:02:08.800 --> 3:02:12.520]  looked just really space agey so I shot a video of it just because I think stuff's
[3:02:12.520 --> 3:02:15.800]  really cool and pretty and people don't get what that means I mean I just like
[3:02:15.800 --> 3:02:22.720]  what is going on out there I mean I just I just don't understand anymore
[3:02:22.720 --> 3:02:26.960]  because again I don't think of myself as that smart and I mean I'm like light
[3:02:26.960 --> 3:02:30.360]  years ahead of the general public and I think it's up to us that know how things
[3:02:30.360 --> 3:02:34.480]  really work to a certain extent to help the cynical arrogant dumb people
[3:02:34.480 --> 3:02:38.560]  nothing is how arrogant dumb idiots are about to say dumb asses but I guess I did
[3:02:38.560 --> 3:02:42.520]  let's take another call Chris in Virginia you're on the year go ahead
[3:02:42.520 --> 3:02:48.240]  hi how are you I'm alright brother how you doing I'm not doing too bad hey I
[3:02:48.240 --> 3:02:54.200]  just wanted to ask you if you had by gotten a chance to look at the inconsistencies
[3:02:54.200 --> 3:03:00.600]  between the Cambridge report that was posted on the Wall Street Journal and
[3:03:00.600 --> 3:03:07.640]  then the FBI indictment in terms of the carjacking I mean there's a ton of
[3:03:07.640 --> 3:03:12.920]  inconsistencies and weirdness and things and I don't the whole story is just a
[3:03:12.920 --> 3:03:17.800]  disaster zone and and clearly is some type of staged event with these guys
[3:03:17.800 --> 3:03:21.720]  working for intelligence and having aliases and definitely the older
[3:03:21.720 --> 3:03:25.680]  brother I mean he was definitely McVay early Harvey Oswald we don't know all
[3:03:25.680 --> 3:03:29.000]  the particulars we just know the the pre-buildup the way they handled it
[3:03:29.000 --> 3:03:33.040]  after this was a scripted event they bear minimum knew and let it happen
[3:03:33.040 --> 3:03:39.480]  bare minimum and and the Cambridge report actually states that the younger
[3:03:39.480 --> 3:03:43.120]  brother what the two brothers were together in a Honda Civic and one of
[3:03:43.120 --> 3:03:47.880]  them approached the door to the Mercedes and tapped on the window the FBI
[3:03:47.880 --> 3:03:53.760]  report says that only one brother went into the Mercedes and then picked up the
[3:03:53.760 --> 3:03:57.680]  second brother drove across town to pick up the second brother listen here's the
[3:03:57.680 --> 3:04:00.440]  deal a lot of times they don't know what happened right away so that's one
