[00:00.000 --> 00:12.100]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.100 --> 00:38.100]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:38.100 --> 00:43.820]  ladies and gentlemen we are locked and loaded and we are ready to explode in
[00:43.820 --> 00:49.260]  defense of liberty I don't just want free humanity to awaken to the globalist
[00:49.260 --> 00:56.180]  threat I want you to come alive and I want to get aggressive in the info war
[00:56.180 --> 01:01.420]  and expose the globalist okay I want to shake the show up we got a special report
[01:01.420 --> 01:07.940]  a week in the making by Aaron Dykes who absolutely is incredibly dedicated in
[01:07.940 --> 01:12.540]  fact if I had to give an award to the most dedicated person in our operation
[01:12.540 --> 01:18.500]  I don't know if I'd have to give it to Paul Watson or Aaron Dykes probably for
[01:18.500 --> 01:23.980]  total hours spent it have to be Watson but when Aaron is on the track which is
[01:23.980 --> 01:28.020]  about half the time of a specific goal he's probably the hardest working I
[01:28.020 --> 01:32.940]  don't know they both have to get the get the gold medal it it probably is a tie
[01:32.940 --> 01:38.900]  the point is is that this is an amazing piece we're gonna premiere here for
[01:38.900 --> 01:44.940]  radio listeners it's a radio special report but it has video as well which is
[01:44.940 --> 01:50.900]  extremely powerful it's award-winning in my humble opinion what what Aaron and I
[01:50.900 --> 01:54.660]  have put together I came up with the concept of the information but Aaron
[01:54.660 --> 01:59.140]  just presented it in an amazing fashion and he could have even had it out
[01:59.140 --> 02:03.060]  quicker but he wanted to take his time with the information so it's a special
[02:03.060 --> 02:06.940]  report I'm not gonna even tell you the name of it or what it deals with until
[02:06.940 --> 02:12.300]  right before we air it coming up in T-minus 30 minutes 50 seconds to be

[02:43.180 --> 02:49.140]  hundred articles in 30 minutes or take 50 calls in an hour I've never done
[02:49.140 --> 02:52.980]  that in like five six years but we got a little bit better as you know so the

[03:20.740 --> 03:25.860]  timing people like oh Alex it's not all a staged event your guest is wrong he and
[03:25.860 --> 03:29.620]  his wife don't you know nobody got the underwear bomber on the plane without a
[03:29.620 --> 03:33.100]  passport and then it all came down congressional hearings exactly what our
[03:33.100 --> 03:40.220]  guest said just like this white supremacist infiltrated group in the
[03:40.220 --> 03:43.900]  Sikh shooting and how they want to kick off a wave of racial attacks and
[03:43.900 --> 03:49.220]  there's calls in the media now about the dangerous white male white males are
[03:49.220 --> 03:53.740]  the second most nonviolent low crime rate group you look at statistics and I
[03:53.740 --> 03:58.940]  don't get off into race stuff but it's all over the media today I was on Man
[03:58.940 --> 04:01.900]  Cow this morning and he was covering the different stories so I'm gonna get to
[04:01.900 --> 04:06.980]  that later where they're saying white males are the threat and are the source
[04:06.980 --> 04:15.500]  of all evil the number one least dangerous group is white women then
[04:15.500 --> 04:19.700]  it's Asian women this is just departments own crime statistics curtain
[04:19.700 --> 04:24.820]  almost written articles about it and then it's white males okay the least
[04:24.820 --> 04:29.580]  violent people are white women and then Asian women and then white males I mean
[04:29.580 --> 04:34.100]  that's just a fact and I am sick of it and now there's calls I've got articles
[04:34.100 --> 04:38.100]  to disarm veterans saying they're all mentally ill and that I'm could own
[04:38.100 --> 04:42.580]  guns no if somebody served eight tours and has been completely screwed up we
[04:42.580 --> 04:45.380]  all deserve the right to own guns to protect ourselves including other
[04:45.380 --> 04:51.260]  veterans so that's just the way it is you cannot start adjudicating the troops
[04:51.260 --> 04:56.420]  as a group and saying they're mentally ill all right we'll be right back stay

[08:35.100 --> 08:41.300]  defeat them their crimes are so legion and so massive if we simply identify
[08:41.300 --> 08:45.980]  them and begin educating the public there is no way the globalist will be
[08:45.980 --> 08:52.580]  able to take over via their agenda 21 UN world government program that's why
[08:52.580 --> 08:57.460]  they've shifted in the last five years or so from denying world government
[08:57.460 --> 09:01.340]  exists more and more to saying of course it exists and you're a terrorist if you
[09:01.340 --> 09:05.620]  don't like it it was you were a terrorist if you said mega banks were plotting to
[09:05.620 --> 09:09.500]  implode national sovereignty through derivatives and bring in world government
[09:09.500 --> 09:13.220]  now they said they must get rid of your sovereignty and bring in world
[09:13.220 --> 09:17.220]  government from the derivatives they created exactly what I warned of 17
[09:17.220 --> 09:21.820]  years ago and economists and others I've interviewed since the broken down and so
[09:21.820 --> 09:25.460]  we are the bad guys because we're aware of what's happening and that's why you're
[09:25.460 --> 09:31.580]  seeing the giant public shift from al-Qaeda being the boogeyman that's in
[09:31.580 --> 09:39.140]  your underwear the TSA has to check for to the conversion now over to the fact
[09:39.140 --> 09:45.220]  that it is John Deere cap wearing conservatives and libertarians and people

[09:53.740 --> 10:01.660]  news articles talking about the lone wolf evil white person so it's gone from as
[10:01.660 --> 10:05.420]  I told you a few years ago that we saw an internal Homeland Security reports
[10:05.420 --> 10:08.860]  that it's the Muslim extremists give up all your rights they're hiding in your

[10:33.500 --> 10:36.380]  going to be the public rollout we could we could see the rollout being
[10:36.380 --> 10:39.500]  prepared behind closed doors because first they get their minions ready for
[10:39.500 --> 10:43.420]  the new enemy and I told you okay coming out of that gates gonna be this
[10:43.420 --> 10:47.660]  particular gladiator because he here's the analogy I've been behind the gates

[12:34.940 --> 12:38.700]  the show folks I got to read some of this later they're like how great Al Qaeda is
[12:38.700 --> 12:46.180]  how how in powerful they are how proud the Pentagon and NATO are of their Al

[12:57.700 --> 13:04.620]  Steve Pachennick he predicted when no one was about a year ago here that
[13:04.620 --> 13:09.220]  Petraeus would be in the cards for VP and people laughed at that of course he
[13:09.220 --> 13:12.900]  knows Petraeus but the last time he was on he was critical of Petraeus so with
[13:12.900 --> 13:18.140]  the inside scoop from the former head of State Department psychological warfare
[13:18.140 --> 13:21.740]  and the State Department really sits above the CIA for those that don't know
[13:21.740 --> 13:25.620]  and of course he's the guy that advised and co-wrote Patriot games and a bunch
[13:25.620 --> 13:31.140]  of other books and a bunch of big movies have been based on films books he
[13:31.140 --> 13:38.500]  wrote Dr. Steve Pachennick will be joining us a very interesting fellow to

[13:42.060 --> 13:45.540]  been to Libya when it's been under bombardment and everything he talked
[13:45.540 --> 13:50.340]  about a year ago when he visited Syria has now come true remember the media is
[13:50.340 --> 13:53.620]  like all they're claiming the West is bringing in Al Qaeda that's not true
[13:53.620 --> 13:57.420]  they're just little protesters blowing up police stations and bombing military
[13:57.420 --> 14:01.380]  bases and schools so Tarpley is going to be joining us as well okay enough of
[14:01.380 --> 14:05.180]  that I said I'd go right to your calls then we'll get into all the economic

[14:28.700 --> 14:35.460]  Oklahoma you're on the air listening on WWCR shortwave go ahead God bless you AJ
[14:35.460 --> 14:40.940]  just wanted to make an announcement here what's going on here on our governor
[14:40.940 --> 14:45.460]  Mary Fallon so-called conservative Christian just announced about a week
[14:45.460 --> 14:49.940]  and a half ago that we're going to be one of the flagship states to start using
[14:49.940 --> 14:54.540]  drones and it was I thought on the local Fox affiliate here and they did a
[14:54.540 --> 14:58.420]  pretty decent story on it is why I thought maybe you might want to check it
[14:58.420 --> 15:01.980]  out by the way they always say our states first they've announced in Florida
[15:01.980 --> 15:06.460]  Texas Oklahoma California Virginia I mean I see the articles every day
[15:06.460 --> 15:10.140]  basically every state is announced we're the first to get it and we're going to
[15:10.140 --> 15:14.860]  have shotguns and tear gas on them and a bunch of Texas counties already got
[15:14.860 --> 15:21.220]  weaponized drones so yeah tell us about it yes sir well exactly they she was so
[15:21.220 --> 15:26.820]  proud standing up there with her yeah she's standing up there with her big
[15:26.820 --> 15:31.140]  grin on her face saying oh this is going to bring in jobs and you know help our
[15:31.140 --> 15:35.940]  economy and help so many things you know our new economy is checkpoints and
[15:35.940 --> 15:42.300]  drones and presents with our money France has over 20 taxes their people pay
[15:42.300 --> 15:46.100]  and if you make over a million euros a year and you're already paying about 80
[15:46.100 --> 15:51.120]  percent and what tax or another whatever you keep you pay 75% on and they
[15:51.120 --> 15:56.340]  got VAT as well on every level that's the system we're going to live under the
[15:56.340 --> 16:00.980]  tax the power to tax is the power to destroy and they're destroying the real
[16:00.980 --> 16:06.780]  economy right now by design go ahead yes sir well on the local Fox affiliate I
[16:06.780 --> 16:10.540]  was really surprised but they did a fair piece on it and they covered the
[16:10.540 --> 16:15.060]  issues that you and I would be concerned about and the man that was doing the
[16:15.060 --> 16:18.660]  interview talking to the people that were going to implement this program was
[16:18.660 --> 16:22.180]  saying you know what about our privacy what about you know civil liberties the
[16:22.180 --> 16:25.700]  guy was actually asking some decent questions so if you can punch that up
[16:25.700 --> 16:28.700]  on YouTube I don't know if it's out there or not somebody may have posted it
[16:28.700 --> 16:34.620]  but it was a fairly decent piece what was the name of the station it's Fox
[16:34.620 --> 16:39.940]  25 of Oklahoma sure we'll look up Fox 25 Oklahoma drones thank you so much
[16:39.940 --> 16:45.780]  yeah the courts have all ruled it's illegal if you've got a fence around
[16:45.780 --> 16:49.900]  your house a privacy fence and a drone flies over it it is violating your
[16:49.900 --> 16:56.860]  privacy if it flies what is it less than if it's above I forget the exact rules
[16:56.860 --> 17:01.660]  but I believe it's 5,000 feet now a 5,000 feet they could fly around
[17:01.660 --> 17:06.260]  Surveyor but again it's all about this feeling of their omnipresent and we're
[17:06.260 --> 17:10.980]  small and it's about weaponizing them so they can send the drones out well we
[17:10.980 --> 17:16.460]  covered the article yesterday that was adopted as policy you know that's the
[17:16.460 --> 17:21.500]  issue this Colonel wrote up this full-spectrum dominance in the homeland
[17:21.500 --> 17:28.860]  2016 and it's a perspective and it was adopted into an overall plan by the
[17:28.860 --> 17:36.540]  chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Dempsey and they say we're preparing for
[17:36.540 --> 17:41.580]  war with the Tea Party and it actually says the Tea Party will link up with
[17:41.580 --> 17:46.260]  al-Qaeda I mean business insider and others have the headlines of firestorm
[17:46.260 --> 17:51.740]  after Colonel's report prepares for Tea Party insurgency that's not the fire
[17:51.740 --> 17:58.660]  storm it says al-Qaeda is going to infiltrate into the US from Mexico and
[17:58.660 --> 18:07.220]  link up with the Tea Party I mean ladies and gentlemen ladies and gentlemen the
[18:07.220 --> 18:13.140]  Tea Party is the most Islamophobic group just it's unbelievable how dumb they
[18:13.140 --> 18:17.020]  think but I told you they're gonna blow stuff up and claim patriots work with
[18:17.020 --> 18:20.700]  al-Qaeda I told you that a long time ago I know these people I eat drink and
[18:20.700 --> 18:28.500]  sleep it I'm inside their mind Moses in Colorado you're on the air go ahead yes

[18:37.220 --> 18:42.340]  gonna be able to do black ops around me cuz I'm gonna pimp them out I'll bust
[18:42.340 --> 18:47.820]  them and all I'll blow the whistle on them that's one of our biggest hopes is
[18:47.820 --> 18:50.740]  just like Kurt Haskell and they know it that's why they're really freaked out
[18:50.740 --> 18:54.940]  they've shed it our people are everywhere terrorist globalist we know who
[18:54.940 --> 18:58.940]  you are we're watching we're gonna catch you just like Kurt Haskell caught
[18:58.940 --> 19:03.540]  you putting the drug down the underwear bomber on the plane I mean I've been
[19:03.540 --> 19:07.780]  too near to death from these people to be bothered by them I'm gonna you know
[19:07.780 --> 19:14.780]  expose them isn't it a good feeling to not be afraid you know I'm mad I'm
[19:14.780 --> 19:19.300]  behind any kind of fear well it's not fun if they get you in
[19:19.300 --> 19:21.900]  torture and stuff but you know what it doesn't matter you're still a good guy
[19:21.900 --> 19:25.580]  they're a bad guy it's a spiritual decision and once you make that decision

[19:30.340 --> 19:33.900]  probably protecting us at the time anyway oh they are protecting us all the
[19:33.900 --> 19:37.980]  time and if we get struck down it's for the greater good that's why I don't pray
[19:37.980 --> 19:41.940]  to God and ask God for this ask God for that I just say please make me not be
[19:41.940 --> 19:45.660]  weak it helped me be a strong vessel against the enemy we'll be right back

[25:00.140 --> 25:04.460]  talk to Blue in Tennessee Blue you're on the air
[25:04.460 --> 25:12.460]  Hey Alex there's a story that's out there that's not getting any traction and it has to do with a Manhattan project here in Oak Ridge, Tennessee
[25:12.460 --> 25:19.620]  there were three protesters that actually went through three fences cut through three fences and got to the interior fence
[25:19.620 --> 25:27.660]  when actually to the uranium depository were able to post banners and spread
[25:27.660 --> 25:31.980]  man your phone is is breaking up I'm gonna let you go but I believe you're
[25:31.980 --> 25:37.660]  talking about protesters that got into a uranium processing plant so they shut
[25:37.660 --> 25:42.020]  the whole thing down for the day and I had a big security alert we're trying to
[25:42.020 --> 25:50.500]  call us back with a better line. Angel in Texas you're on the air. Hi Alex I'm in a
[25:50.500 --> 25:56.700]  very strange predicament I live in El Paso, Texas right on the border and I'm
[25:56.700 --> 26:01.700]  actually experiencing police state like up front I'm actually seeing military
[26:01.700 --> 26:06.540]  inside police cars and I can actually send you pictures of this I'm actually
[26:06.540 --> 26:12.620]  seeing drones and helicopters and all kinds of crazy stuff here one of the
[26:12.620 --> 26:18.460]  questions you're down by Fort Bliss aren't you yes yes that's joint task force
[26:18.460 --> 26:22.580]  that's joint task force six what's going on is that's actually where they
[26:22.580 --> 26:27.260]  train them and then they exfiltrate back into police departments all over the
[26:27.260 --> 26:31.260]  country and get the police through peer pressure to engage in the illegal
[26:31.260 --> 26:38.580]  activity of military in kind of they're not plain clothes but they're just
[26:38.580 --> 26:43.700]  solid blue or black generic police uniforms and they use them to kill
[26:43.700 --> 26:48.460]  citizens what they call high-risk warrant service mainly gun shop owners
[26:48.460 --> 26:53.260]  gun owners veterans and I've confirmed from the sources but we've also seen it
[26:53.260 --> 26:56.140]  in the news but it's buried in the back of the paper where they bring in
[26:56.140 --> 27:00.980]  military not just at Waco but all over not just Ruby Ridge it's standard to go
[27:00.980 --> 27:07.180]  in and to kill US citizens it's totally illegal but but so is the and mainly
[27:07.180 --> 27:11.180]  they're killing veterans so they use military to kill military and also rural
[27:11.180 --> 27:14.820]  folks that won't turn their land over and of course they use drones on people
[27:14.820 --> 27:18.340]  with their cattle and stuff in North Dakota but tell us what's happening in
[27:18.340 --> 27:25.340]  your area well see in my area right now all I all I can see for sure is is that
[27:25.340 --> 27:29.700]  military are just fully clothed inside police cars and they're literally
[27:29.700 --> 27:35.780]  driving around in them I see huge police aren't even driving in normal police
[27:35.780 --> 27:40.500]  cars anymore they're driving in these huge kind of I mean they're marked as
[27:40.500 --> 27:44.580]  police cars but they're huge and they look like the Homeland Security kind of
[27:44.580 --> 27:48.820]  truck they have giant black trucks that are the new Homeland Security trucks
[27:48.820 --> 27:53.380]  going in nation nationwide yes they're the police will roll around in giant
[27:53.380 --> 27:57.220]  tanks because the foreign banks took over these are collaborators most of them
[27:57.220 --> 28:02.020]  don't know it and they are training the military that not just the MPs now but
[28:02.020 --> 28:07.620]  general military in police work but before they deploy brigade homeland to
[28:07.620 --> 28:13.180]  every city every major city a city the size of Austin will have 4,000 troops
[28:13.180 --> 28:18.540]  in it a city the size of Dallas will have about 12,000 the place like New
[28:18.540 --> 28:22.860]  York will have about 50,000 troops in it and we're to be fully occupied by the
[28:22.860 --> 28:26.780]  foreign New World Order Army and they expect a lot of military once the gun
[28:26.780 --> 28:31.780]  confiscation begins to rebel so they'll simultaneously be purges in the
[28:31.780 --> 28:35.540]  military of active duty but then the hunting down of veterans they have
[28:35.540 --> 28:42.620]  files on for extermination right and I'm a veteran and I live here and I also
[28:42.620 --> 28:47.780]  I'm a gun owner but but here's the thing I'm really worried about when
[28:47.780 --> 28:54.500]  I was in the military you know I was I guess I was ignorant and young and we
[28:54.500 --> 28:58.700]  were training to do a lot of different things and I really didn't think about
[28:58.700 --> 29:03.020]  it when I was in the military I didn't I didn't think or question my own motives
[29:03.020 --> 29:06.300]  or or the motives of others or or anything no but they know you're gonna
[29:06.300 --> 29:09.900]  question later so a lot of most tyrannies do this they have the new
[29:09.900 --> 29:15.340]  military kill the old military because they're afraid of seasoned soldiers
[29:15.340 --> 29:20.180]  that wake up so it's basically decommissioning hey look if the New
[29:20.180 --> 29:23.020]  World Order if they're already killing you through the water and food just when
[29:23.020 --> 29:29.140]  they come to kill you thank them for decommissioning you I also I also wanted
[29:29.140 --> 29:32.740]  to I tell you what I'll go back to you after I play this special report it's

[29:40.100 --> 29:42.900]  al-qaeda is the military I told you that was coming
[29:42.900 --> 29:47.140]  homeland security is here to destroy America it works for the foreign banks

[33:10.340 --> 33:32.020]  he it's Alex Jones we are back my friends the system that we're going
[33:32.020 --> 33:39.300]  under is not an American system it is an alien globalist criminal takeover and
[33:39.300 --> 33:44.420]  our enemies in publications in elite publications meant for themselves that
[33:44.420 --> 33:49.300]  are public though arrogantly admit they run al-qaeda arrogantly admit they want
[33:49.300 --> 33:53.220]  to end the family arrogantly admit they're creating a top-down economy
[33:53.220 --> 33:58.300]  where global offshore banks are above the law and exempt from taxes and where
[33:58.300 --> 34:02.980]  they will levy taxes on us so great that they can absolutely engineer our
[34:02.980 --> 34:10.860]  society in a hellish direction we have had the Rothschild's pretty much in
[34:10.860 --> 34:17.580]  control since 1815 of global affairs they merged with the Saxe-Coburg gothers
[34:17.580 --> 34:21.460]  at that time the British royalty that's really Transylvania royalty the media
[34:21.460 --> 34:25.980]  calls them German royalty but their their precursor is Transylvania and you
[34:25.980 --> 34:30.340]  can't make this stuff up can look that up by the way if you think I'm joking and
[34:30.340 --> 34:36.020]  they have learned to develop a system of full spectrum dominance where they
[34:36.020 --> 34:41.860]  fund all the sides of a conflict sometimes more than two sides they fund
[34:41.860 --> 34:45.860]  and create a Hitler that's been in congressional records to then wreck
[34:45.860 --> 34:49.700]  Europe so they can offer the solution to go take over Europe after it's destroyed
[34:49.700 --> 34:58.820]  with them with the Marshall plan the OECD takeover the organization of cooperative
[34:58.820 --> 35:05.900]  development which they admit is at the heart of the euro today this is a global
[35:05.900 --> 35:12.100]  corporate system that is to be exempt from law outside of law with global
[35:12.100 --> 35:18.100]  diplomatic immunity and so to illustrate this we have produced a very
[35:18.100 --> 35:21.380]  important piece that we're going to premiere right here on the radio if
[35:21.380 --> 35:25.340]  you're a prison planet dot TV viewer you can watch it and boy is it powerful with
[35:25.340 --> 35:31.900]  the graphics that Aaron Dykes has put together and then in the next hour we
[35:31.900 --> 35:38.900]  will post it at info wars dot com for everyone so start your engines info
[35:38.900 --> 35:50.140]  warriors get this out to everybody we are titling this video full spectrum
[35:50.140 --> 36:03.700]  evil full spectrum evil you're facing full spectrum evil they create Al Qaeda
[36:03.700 --> 36:10.780]  use Al Qaeda against Russia the Serbs moderate Muslim countries they use Al
[36:10.780 --> 36:14.260]  Qaeda against the United States or Al Qaeda takes the blame for globalist
[36:14.260 --> 36:20.060]  attacks as a pretext to take our liberties it is a key set piece they move
[36:20.060 --> 36:24.140]  around the board to wherever they want to invade and they think you're so
[36:24.140 --> 36:28.060]  stupid they can tell you Al Qaeda our heroes go look at the council on farm
[36:28.060 --> 36:38.980]  relations latest report they put out last Friday where they praise CFR.org
[36:38.980 --> 36:44.820]  foreign affairs they praise Al Qaeda that's how dumb they think you are and
[36:44.820 --> 36:50.620]  now they're flipping the script to domestic terrorist and creating this
[36:50.620 --> 36:54.500]  fear that there are white terrorists they're now saying on the news the last
[36:54.500 --> 36:57.740]  year you saw the Homeland Security training videos where all the terrorists
[36:57.740 --> 37:01.860]  are white blowing up shopping malls movie theater sports stadiums and then it
[37:01.860 --> 37:07.740]  starts then it begins and then the people are all government run
[37:07.740 --> 37:14.940]  Air Force top psychiatrist multiple shooters witnesses say army Psyops
[37:14.940 --> 37:18.860]  connected the witnesses see four shooters the head of the Sikh temple
[37:18.860 --> 37:23.300]  sees men casing the joint I mean white supremacist groups more than half of
[37:23.300 --> 37:28.060]  them are feds the members it's come out they're run in almost every case by the
[37:28.060 --> 37:32.580]  feds what do you do you just kill one of your operatives after your operatives
[37:32.580 --> 37:39.300]  shoot people they infiltrate then they bug out and then you put it on the news
[37:39.300 --> 37:45.100]  very simple this is how a black op is run and so the globalists are now dropping
[37:45.100 --> 37:50.300]  the hammer on us with these false flags and this is the summer of false flags
[37:50.300 --> 37:55.060]  that will lead into the fall and the winner of huge wars if they get away
[37:55.060 --> 38:00.460]  with this we are in grave danger so to understand this we premiere here on the
[38:00.460 --> 38:07.060]  syndicated radio transmission full spectrum evil where you create the
[38:07.060 --> 38:12.060]  enemy as the decoy combat simulant so you can invade and take over the opium
[38:12.060 --> 38:21.020]  or you have the combat decoy simulant threaten your nation so that you can
[38:21.020 --> 38:24.180]  take the liberties of your country while posing as the saviors when you're
[38:24.180 --> 38:32.820]  nothing but a banker occupying force here it is full spectrum evil the secret
[38:32.820 --> 38:37.260]  of the new world order takeover program
[38:42.380 --> 38:47.540]  Alex Jones here to cover a topic an issue that is one of the most important
[38:47.540 --> 38:52.820]  I've ever discussed this information is very closely held by governments and
[38:52.820 --> 38:58.580]  elite corporations they do not want you understanding this now many of you
[38:58.580 --> 39:03.220]  that are already aware of this it'll seem simple but large swaths of the
[39:03.220 --> 39:09.420]  global population have no idea the real geopolitical paradigm that we're living
[39:09.420 --> 39:14.180]  in today today we'll look at the real forces the real players in the battle
[39:14.180 --> 39:19.220]  for 21st century global hegemony I'm gonna break down who really rules the
[39:19.220 --> 39:23.980]  world how they control the planet and how they are trying to usher in a
[39:23.980 --> 39:30.100]  world war that is really pointed at the general population to begin my
[39:30.100 --> 39:34.980]  illustration I have three different board games here chess the classic game
[39:34.980 --> 39:40.500]  of risk as well as monopoly we're gonna look at these systems of stylized
[39:40.500 --> 39:44.980]  warfare and between these three systems we find the truth of the system that
[39:44.980 --> 39:49.020]  we're living under how do we know that system well books written by people like
[39:49.020 --> 39:54.060]  Carol Quigley at Georgetown Bill Clinton's mentor they think we're
[39:54.060 --> 39:58.740]  stupid and so we have their own documents to begin with I'm going to use a
[39:58.740 --> 40:04.940]  Lego chess set as a illustration to break down primitive forms of government
[40:04.940 --> 40:10.260]  warfare and domination if you look at this set you notice there are two sides
[40:10.260 --> 40:14.380]  there is the red and there is the green or there is the black there is the white
[40:14.380 --> 40:20.780]  from the beginnings of civilization more than 6,000 years ago until about 1700
[40:20.780 --> 40:26.860]  this was the model of warfare between nations there were occasional
[40:26.860 --> 40:32.020]  alliances but by and large warfare and politics was carried out in a very
[40:32.020 --> 40:38.140]  two-dimensional way like a chess set you have the ruling class the royalty the
[40:38.140 --> 40:44.460]  priest class the military elite the generals and in front of them you have
[40:44.460 --> 40:48.620]  basically their conscripts of the lower class fighters who can also represent
[40:48.620 --> 40:53.860]  just the general population and these two groups are engaged in warfare and
[40:53.860 --> 41:00.100]  base domination against each other to control larger areas of land and the
[41:00.100 --> 41:05.060]  vassal populations living in serfdom upon it one area that we see from the
[41:05.060 --> 41:10.540]  ancient chess model that is still used in statecraft by the globalist is the
[41:10.540 --> 41:15.460]  fact that sometimes wars were launched in the case of the French and the
[41:15.460 --> 41:20.780]  British against each other when they had rebellions at home they soon learned
[41:20.780 --> 41:27.460]  it was a way to turn inner anger at the state against a foreign state and to
[41:27.460 --> 41:32.660]  reduce the population of young males that you didn't have jobs for the two
[41:32.660 --> 41:40.020]  sided fight is a bygone era in truth for more than 300 years the globalist have
[41:40.020 --> 41:45.100]  been financing multiple sides of wars knowing that conflict destroys nations
[41:45.100 --> 41:51.220]  and gets countries deep into debt and that is the key they're financing both
[41:51.220 --> 41:56.420]  sides and we see this being pioneered by people like the Rothschilds starting in
[41:56.420 --> 42:01.220]  the 17 and 1800s where they would finance sometimes three or four different
[42:01.220 --> 42:05.940]  factions and it didn't matter who won because all of them were in debt to them
[42:05.940 --> 42:12.020]  and had societies that were wrecked after the wars next let's look at the game of
[42:12.020 --> 42:19.320]  risk these are primitive attempts to distill down human conflict and
[42:19.320 --> 42:25.180]  domination into a game you can play in a few hours the militaries all have
[42:25.180 --> 42:29.180]  basically equal resources equal numbers of troops and to enter into the
[42:29.180 --> 42:33.620]  equation some type of random probability we have dice and we have
[42:33.620 --> 42:40.220]  carts there is no discussion here on looking at the real model that we are
[42:40.220 --> 42:44.940]  under today we're going to come back to risk here in a moment but first let's
[42:44.940 --> 42:51.780]  move to the game of monopoly in the game of monopoly you have different
[42:51.780 --> 42:57.140]  economic groups or four players that attempt to engage in economic warfare
[42:57.140 --> 43:02.900]  against each other and then be able to create a monopoly or a single entity
[43:02.900 --> 43:07.860]  that is in control of New York City to understand the real system we're under
[43:07.860 --> 43:13.580]  it's important to combine monopoly and risk with an overlay of strategy from
[43:13.580 --> 43:19.220]  chess and this is a key part of the real system we live under today the founder
[43:19.220 --> 43:24.140]  of the Rockefeller dynasty famously said that competition was a sin and they
[43:24.140 --> 43:28.900]  wanted big governments that they financed in control to be able to shut
[43:28.900 --> 43:33.500]  down their competition and pick winners and losers this is the essence of
[43:33.500 --> 43:38.660]  monopoly capitalism the opposite of free market and is simply a form of fascism
[43:38.660 --> 43:44.300]  what Mussolini called corporatism so out of these three board games monopoly
[43:44.300 --> 43:50.100]  best describes our modern system but in itself is only two-dimensional you see
[43:50.100 --> 43:54.340]  the private Federal Reserve that's owned by six private banks Goldman Sachs
[43:54.340 --> 44:00.580]  JP Morgan Bank of America and others they always win you're playing their game
[44:00.580 --> 44:05.900]  you think you're battling it out for houses and apartments and for part place
[44:05.900 --> 44:10.180]  and for the electric company and for the railroad and for the top hat and for
[44:10.180 --> 44:14.500]  the fashion show but it's the bankers that control the politicians they've
[44:14.500 --> 44:20.020]  got to get out of jail free card and they've got control of the money the
[44:20.020 --> 44:26.180]  Treasury works for them so the bank always wins but what happens if a
[44:26.180 --> 44:33.140]  country won't sell what happens if an African nation won't play the monopoly
[44:33.140 --> 44:38.420]  game or what happens of a Middle Eastern country doesn't want to be part of the
[44:38.420 --> 44:43.340]  modern Bankster system based in London in New York well then that's where risk
[44:43.340 --> 44:48.300]  comes in because they want to be able to take you over through economic espionage
[44:48.300 --> 44:52.220]  as John Perkins has written and his best-seller confessions of an economic
[44:52.220 --> 44:57.660]  hitman but if they can't this is in all the official CIA and State Department
[44:57.660 --> 45:04.540]  documents they will then come and finance your neighbor to attack you so
[45:04.540 --> 45:10.100]  Libby is not playing ball it's building up an industrializing all of Africa you
[45:10.100 --> 45:14.420]  want a global monopoly you just play countries off against each other you're
[45:14.420 --> 45:18.340]  a globalist you've made yourselves example diplomatic community at the
[45:18.340 --> 45:22.740]  United Nations who set that up the robber barons what do you do you just
[45:22.740 --> 45:28.380]  have al-Qaeda come out of Egypt into Libya ethnically cleanse blow up most of
[45:28.380 --> 45:34.460]  the infrastructure knock out Qaddafi and now they have to come to you and borrow
[45:34.460 --> 45:40.940]  money out of your bank to rebuild and you own and control everything and guess
[45:40.940 --> 45:45.020]  what if you want to get that welfare check well you got to take the vaccines
[45:45.020 --> 45:49.620]  which by the way sterilize you so they're using the strategy of chess but
[45:49.620 --> 45:53.580]  they're employing it through a monopolistic system where they have a
[45:53.580 --> 45:58.220]  monopoly on the issuance of currency and credit and they also have the biggest
[45:58.220 --> 46:02.540]  militaries on earth from the United States in Europe controlled and
[46:02.540 --> 46:06.620]  dominated a hundred percent by them they've announced that we're totally
[46:06.620 --> 46:11.820]  their slaves and they have such disdain for us they use our supposed enemy
[46:11.820 --> 46:17.660]  al-Qaeda against the Russians against the Serbs and now against other Middle
[46:17.660 --> 46:23.420]  Eastern nations while simultaneously telling us we need military style
[46:23.420 --> 46:29.940]  occupation within our countries by the TSA and the military to keep us safe
[46:29.940 --> 46:36.660]  from al-Qaeda who they sponsored and created and remember the banksters are
[46:36.660 --> 46:42.020]  openly crowing and bragging that they have conquered you through monopoly
[46:42.020 --> 46:46.740]  capitalism the question is do we all work for central bankers that's what I
[46:46.740 --> 46:51.500]  want to address to our guests tonight is this global governance at last is it
[46:51.500 --> 46:55.980]  one world the central bankers in charge aren't we all just living and dying for
[46:55.980 --> 46:59.860]  what the central banks do answer your question we are absolutely slaves to
[46:59.860 --> 47:03.460]  central banks and they weren't able to do this because they had better products
[47:03.460 --> 47:08.460]  they were able to do it because they created the fractional reserve banking
[47:08.460 --> 47:13.580]  here in the US and similar systems worldwide unlimited free credit for
[47:13.580 --> 47:19.700]  themselves which they then loan out to you at interest but that wasn't enough
[47:19.700 --> 47:24.020]  of a fraud for them in the last 20 years they've deployed derivatives
[47:24.020 --> 47:30.260]  completely made up counterfeit instruments to the tune of more than 1.5
[47:30.260 --> 47:38.180]  quadrillion that's 1,500 trillion with that counterfeit money they were able
[47:38.180 --> 47:42.980]  to buy up all of their competition pay off the governments and dominate
[47:42.980 --> 47:48.100]  defense industries as well as media to carry out their propaganda and herein
[47:48.100 --> 47:52.620]  lies the big secret that they don't want you to know the big secret hiding in
[47:52.620 --> 48:01.180]  plain view we think about nations and continents and cultures but in truth the
[48:01.180 --> 48:06.900]  globalist the bankers who have unlimited money they're waging war against
[48:06.900 --> 48:11.980]  anyone else that has any assets because they want everyone to be impoverished so
[48:11.980 --> 48:17.060]  you have to go to them and so that you have to follow all of their orders so
[48:17.060 --> 48:22.340]  they can control human development and society in the past they would brag about
[48:22.340 --> 48:26.940]  their real political system in fictional accounts in movies like network
[48:26.940 --> 48:33.700]  let's analyze a clip of that there is no America there is no democracy there is
[48:33.700 --> 48:45.780]  only IBM and ITT and AT&T and Dupont Dow Union Carbide and Exxon one vast and
[48:45.780 --> 48:53.740]  ecumenical holding for whom all men will work to serve a common profit in which
[48:53.740 --> 48:59.540]  all men will hold a share of stock oh there are no more peoples there are no
[48:59.540 --> 49:04.860]  more nations mr. Beale each one of us has one piece of stock in the global
[49:04.860 --> 49:10.420]  system one ecumenical giant global government except one thing that big
[49:10.420 --> 49:14.860]  global corporate system they've been selling us on doesn't want us to even be
[49:14.860 --> 49:19.620]  alive it's designed to consolidate control and then slowly cut off the
[49:19.620 --> 49:24.980]  resources while the banksters themselves pose as the saviors selling people on
[49:24.980 --> 49:29.060]  getting deeper into the tyranny and the pain will stop when at the end of the
[49:29.060 --> 49:32.940]  tunnel is nothing but global extermination and eugenics so that
[49:32.940 --> 49:37.660]  these selfish greedy scam artists can have the world and all of the
[49:37.660 --> 49:42.140]  incredible technology and life extension for themselves and that's the big

[51:09.020 --> 51:12.100]  going on in this country I don't have to tell you about the power grid and just
[51:12.100 --> 51:16.060]  how vulnerable it is that's in the mainstream news every day millions of
[51:16.060 --> 51:19.740]  people have lost their power in the last few weeks because of dangerous storms

[54:26.460 --> 54:31.100]  the global engineers have lulled everyone or large portions of the global
[54:31.100 --> 54:37.620]  population into a high-driven fantasy world but as the real world implodes
[54:37.620 --> 54:41.540]  around them people are going to be more apt to get out of fantasy land and join
[54:41.540 --> 54:45.700]  us in reality and come in for the big win against the globalist look at fast
[54:45.700 --> 54:50.300]  and furious look at the LIBOR scandal all this stuff starting to come out
[54:50.300 --> 54:53.940]  bankers are hanging themselves and jumping off cliffs they're really being
[54:53.940 --> 55:00.060]  killed by people above them so that they can't get the blame but the point is
[55:00.060 --> 55:05.100]  is that Kinley Bernie Madoff we can send all these people to prison now our own
[55:05.100 --> 55:09.060]  corruption allows this to happen in the first place and we're never gonna live
[55:09.060 --> 55:13.860]  in a perfect utopia until Jesus comes back but the point is the churches want
[55:13.860 --> 55:17.540]  you to think Christ is coming back tomorrow so you never fight evil if
[55:17.540 --> 55:22.700]  if Christ was coming next week we have a responsibility to fight evil and if
[55:22.700 --> 55:25.380]  you're not a Christian you have a responsibility to fight evil because it
[55:25.380 --> 55:30.940]  will run all over you if you don't this giant military industrial complex is
[55:30.940 --> 55:35.100]  owned by foreign banks it's building up for war against us it's treasonous this
[55:35.100 --> 55:41.740]  is our country and it needs to stop I mean I saw an article in human events
[55:41.740 --> 55:45.100]  last week and it's like yeah people don't like it but it doesn't matter
[55:45.100 --> 55:49.220]  drones are coming and they're gonna be weaponized you don't like it so what
[55:49.220 --> 55:54.100]  it's this attitude a year is nothing you can do used to they'd say people love
[55:54.100 --> 55:57.420]  the weaponized drones now it's like the drones that come in and there's nothing
[55:57.420 --> 56:02.820]  you can do you bet there's something we can do all right let's go back to the
[56:02.820 --> 56:07.340]  calls Pachanic Dr. Steve Pachanic is coming up at eight after but we're gonna
[56:07.340 --> 56:12.220]  take calls right now let's go to back to Angel in Texas because he brought up
[56:12.220 --> 56:18.020]  seeing police with military dress and he's a veteran driving around El Paso in
[56:18.020 --> 56:22.620]  the city and I've seen this in the news these giant black armored trucks that
[56:22.620 --> 56:25.700]  say homeland security but police departments are getting them to these
[56:25.700 --> 56:30.400]  big modern war wagons and I mean all over the country you you heard the St.
[56:30.400 --> 56:36.180]  Louis police officers on it was in the news of giant wheeled tanks driving
[56:36.180 --> 56:40.340]  around and even going in people's houses I've got footage of where they've done
[56:40.340 --> 56:43.740]  urban warfare drills and set up real checkpoints and that's been in the news
[56:43.740 --> 56:47.060]  in Tennessee you name it just a few years ago so yeah they're getting us
[56:47.060 --> 56:52.940]  ready for this what was your other point sir I think that they run drills
[56:52.940 --> 56:59.300]  where I live as well because I actually can see them from Fort Bliss just
[56:59.300 --> 57:02.980]  running certain drills I don't know what exactly they're doing but they're
[57:02.980 --> 57:08.500]  getting prepared like crazy like like really hardcore like they're really all
[57:08.500 --> 57:14.660]  I gotta say is like when I was in the military I mean the thing is is that
[57:14.660 --> 57:18.700]  these young kids they're just gonna do what they're told Alex they're just
[57:18.700 --> 57:21.500]  gonna bust through the door and they're just gonna shoot people well that's why
[57:21.500 --> 57:25.220]  they have them in the military and vintage shoot them up video games the
[57:25.220 --> 57:30.300]  games like doom are to create instinctive shooting get some get some as they
[57:30.300 --> 57:33.860]  call it and yeah that's what's gonna happen and they the Civil War will start
[57:33.860 --> 57:39.140]  and the bankers will sit back and laugh about it what if what if this false
[57:39.140 --> 57:44.660]  flag is even more obvious like like for example with the James Holmes incident I
[57:44.660 --> 57:49.620]  noticed something I I have a site by site photo of James Holmes and and the
[57:49.620 --> 57:56.860]  guy in court on my website and and it it looks shockingly different I mean to
[57:56.860 --> 58:01.660]  the point where even the nose has changed well listen I mean look the big tip
[58:01.660 --> 58:07.620]  off is they the underwear bomber was drugged up show his homes homes can't
[58:07.620 --> 58:11.700]  even talk okay I mean it's simple they go shoot up a building that matter where
[58:11.700 --> 58:16.020]  people see you bring in a drugged up patsy because mind control is hard to
[58:16.020 --> 58:19.580]  run I mean you can get like sir and sir and was drugged out but they pinned his
[58:19.580 --> 58:23.100]  army shot the gun against the wall the cops said no the guy behind him shot RFK
[58:23.100 --> 58:27.340]  that's in the police reports but the media just said no no no it was it was
[58:27.340 --> 58:30.540]  sir and sir and so a lot of times now they don't even have the drugged up mind
[58:30.540 --> 58:34.700]  control guy to the shooting you have a foreign black op team do it you have the
[58:34.700 --> 58:40.140]  drugged up idiot waiting in the parking lot man it's just how they do it
[58:42.340 --> 58:51.500]  this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network the worst drought in 50
[58:51.500 --> 58:55.540]  years continues and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on

[59:00.460 --> 59:05.020]  soy alfalfa fruits vegetables and wheat are all impacted raising prices the
[59:05.020 --> 59:08.220]  cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business
[59:08.220 --> 59:12.260]  blowing up your food prices the only strategy to counter this is to freeze
[59:12.260 --> 59:16.180]  your food cost to today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from
[59:16.180 --> 59:20.340]  e-foods direct now as the price of raw ingredients increases e-foods will have

[01:01:02.620 --> 01:01:09.020]  coming up right now let's take a few calls in this short little segment let's
[01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:14.300]  go to Karen in Arizona hi Alex I would like to let you know about an
[01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:19.940]  environmental and sustainability summit coming to Prescott on the 16th and
[01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:26.420]  17th of August and they should call it land grabbing enslavement conference or
[01:01:26.420 --> 01:01:31.580]  turning Prescott into a giant control freak prison being hin-packed by
[01:01:31.580 --> 01:01:36.460]  bureaucrats but I guess they're not calling it that it's by Arizona
[01:01:36.460 --> 01:01:42.540]  manufacturing council and Arizona businesses advancing sustainability and
[01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:48.660]  if we can get as many info warriors from Arizona to come to this conference the
[01:01:48.660 --> 01:01:55.980]  main conference is going to be on the 17th and isn't it interesting the ADEQ is
[01:01:55.980 --> 01:02:04.620]  Henry Darwin isn't that some similarity of interesting of names the panelists

[01:02:14.020 --> 01:02:20.940]  can get a call out to many of the info warriors to come and yes I mean I mean
[01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:24.180]  people who love liberty should constantly be watching everything in their
[01:02:24.180 --> 01:02:28.340]  area and going out and confronting globalists at every event they can and
[01:02:28.340 --> 01:02:31.700]  they'll run like the roaches they are thank you for the call again we're going
[01:02:31.700 --> 01:02:35.620]  to break here in a moment dr. Steve Pachennick coming up with huge news after
[01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:39.180]  this break we've got them on hold because some stations don't carry this
[01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:43.260]  segment and I don't want anybody to miss the info let's talk to Rob in
[01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:48.500]  Washington Rob you're on the air go ahead yeah hey Alex I just want to say
[01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:51.980]  God bless you I know you don't like to hear all that stuff but hey man I I
[01:02:51.980 --> 01:02:57.700]  love you to death anyways but I just wanted to bring up the Obamacare makes
[01:02:57.700 --> 01:03:03.700]  RFID chips mandatory March 23rd 2013 well what it says is is it'll make
[01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:09.900]  insurance pay for it okay again and they're putting chips in the pills now
[01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:13.860]  and a bunch of stuff but it does move into government-run medical ice
[01:03:13.860 --> 01:03:18.460]  tyranny it does have these panels these death panels they admit they're not you
[01:03:18.460 --> 01:03:22.260]  know oh you're above 65 you don't get eye surgery I mean it's the hellish
[01:03:22.260 --> 01:03:27.100]  system they have in Canada the hellish system they have in England well you
[01:03:27.100 --> 01:03:30.740]  know are you know from what I read on this discussion or like the you know
[01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:34.540]  breakdown of it being a class-to-device that they're talking about implanting
[01:03:34.540 --> 01:03:37.940]  that microchip in people you know and I'm thinking the mark of the beast
[01:03:37.940 --> 01:03:42.660]  revelations yeah well sure I mean there moves everywhere to make Alzheimer's
[01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:46.180]  patients prisoners you name it take them people we were at a swim meet with our
[01:03:46.180 --> 01:03:50.300]  children a month ago and some fathers like yeah I guarantee when they come out
[01:03:50.300 --> 01:03:52.620]  with chips I'm putting them in my daughter I don't want to have to watch
[01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:57.140]  her you know as if that's gonna make you safe all of this stuff has backdoors
[01:03:57.140 --> 01:04:02.140]  built into it for tyranny well you know I'm just wondering how they're gonna try
[01:04:02.140 --> 01:04:05.900]  to force you to take it because you know you know the end you know biblically it
[01:04:05.900 --> 01:04:09.500]  says that if you take the mark you're separating yourself from God I know this
[01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:13.260]  isn't a Christian show all the way but you know my concerns are is you know I
[01:04:13.260 --> 01:04:18.060]  mean it's not a Christian show you know I appreciate your call sir listen it
[01:04:18.060 --> 01:04:22.900]  isn't about whether it's a Christian show most the shows you hear on the radio
[01:04:22.900 --> 01:04:26.500]  that are on religious stations are worshiping world government worshiping
[01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:30.540]  tyranny Romans 13 Hitler's favorite Bible verse do what the government says
[01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:37.020]  you know all of this stuff the founding fathers are bad type stuff okay this is
[01:04:37.020 --> 01:04:45.540]  a radio analysis commentary rant guest transmission so it's not like you can't
[01:04:45.540 --> 01:04:49.380]  call in and read Bible verses if you don't want to but then it hits a
[01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:53.020]  stickler with me when people are like ooh I mentioned a Bible thing who that's
[01:04:53.020 --> 01:04:56.220]  not okay because that's not what we're talking about here Dr. Steve Pachennick
[01:04:56.220 --> 01:05:04.620]  coming up Alex Jones here with a great way to beat the blackouts get off the
[01:05:04.620 --> 01:05:08.500]  grid and generate your own supply of electrical power folks with what's been
[01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:11.660]  going on in this country I don't have to tell you about the power grid and just
[01:05:11.660 --> 01:05:15.740]  how vulnerable it is that's in the mainstream news every day millions of
[01:05:15.740 --> 01:05:19.540]  people have lost their power in the last few weeks because of dangerous storms
[01:05:19.540 --> 01:05:24.100]  and killer heat that's pushing the grid beyond its capacity I've always said
[01:05:24.100 --> 01:05:27.860]  that every family needs to be ready for blackouts and if you don't have a
[01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:32.140]  backup system in place I've got a great opportunity for you right now our good

[01:08:09.540 --> 01:08:16.100]  okay for the balance of the hour the next 52 minutes dr. steve pacenic md phd
[01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:20.340]  is gonna be our guest he was the head of psychological operations for the state
[01:08:20.340 --> 01:08:25.260]  department advise the Pentagon has been involved will just look up his name and
[01:08:25.260 --> 01:08:29.580]  take downs of governments all over the world you name it but not with armies
[01:08:29.580 --> 01:08:34.500]  with psychological warfare he's an expert in false flags he's exposed on
[01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:39.780]  this broadcast 9-11 is a false flag and other events he said that the shooting
[01:08:39.780 --> 01:08:45.020]  in norway was not an inside job I don't know his take on the new shootings and I
[01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:49.300]  wanted to get him on because he said like over a year ago he said on this show
[01:08:49.300 --> 01:08:53.100]  you all heard it that he thought Petraeus would be in the running for vice
[01:08:53.100 --> 01:08:56.740]  president and I've always found drudge in his sources drudge doesn't go with
[01:08:56.740 --> 01:08:59.300]  something when drudge writes an article maybe once every two weeks or
[01:08:59.300 --> 01:09:05.020]  something or his sources there in DC some of which I've met with and no they
[01:09:05.020 --> 01:09:07.460]  don't go with something unless they've got it from the highest levels and their
[01:09:07.460 --> 01:09:13.140]  word is Obama was concerned that Petraeus may be picked as the VP and that
[01:09:13.140 --> 01:09:16.540]  that would be a strong VP picked around with Romney Petraeus to say that's not
[01:09:16.540 --> 01:09:20.540]  the case but they always say that but dr. Steve Pacinic showing his inside
[01:09:20.540 --> 01:09:24.580]  knowledge I was saying that a year ago here just like he said they had been
[01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:28.380]  lauding on ice and would stage his death let you know state announces death later
[01:09:28.380 --> 01:09:32.060]  as a stunt he broke down how that was a fraud now they're running TV ads have a
[01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:37.460]  movie coming out about it we'll get his take on that coming up later as well but
[01:09:37.460 --> 01:09:40.420]  he separately I believe because he's talked to the producer I haven't talked
[01:09:40.420 --> 01:09:47.300]  to him yet so he wanted to get into the shooters which I see this as as a October
[01:09:47.300 --> 01:09:50.860]  surprise because I saw the prescripting my homeland security saying it isn't
[01:09:50.860 --> 01:09:56.140]  al-Qaeda now it's going to be right wing groups and then you have Air Force
[01:09:56.140 --> 01:10:01.340]  psychiatrist over him and you have a sheep dipped army you know black ops
[01:10:01.340 --> 01:10:06.340]  psyops guy because half the people like supremacist groups are feds the feds
[01:10:06.340 --> 01:10:10.180]  lead them like Hal Turner but but I don't even know dr. Pacinic's take on
[01:10:10.180 --> 01:10:15.740]  that we'll find out here on air together I just respect his view he's also a
[01:10:15.740 --> 01:10:21.340]  best-selling author co-wrote books with Tom Clancy as his expert a net force
[01:10:21.340 --> 01:10:25.420]  ops center you name it trained in psychiatry only got to have a degree at
[01:10:25.420 --> 01:10:29.780]  the same time he got Harvard University and international relations at MIT as
[01:10:29.780 --> 01:10:34.540]  we also a doctor and a PhD his novels are based on over 20 years experience
[01:10:34.540 --> 01:10:37.980]  resolving international crises and Haas's situation for the Department of
[01:10:37.980 --> 01:10:42.620]  State for four administrations so he's a super insider and he's very you know
[01:10:42.620 --> 01:10:47.580]  humble like most big insiders are but he has incredible courage to come on and
[01:10:47.580 --> 01:10:52.020]  say 9-11's an inside job now I'm gonna try to sit back and shut up because I am
[01:10:52.020 --> 01:10:55.820]  obnoxious and let him start with wherever he wants to start the shooters
[01:10:55.820 --> 01:11:02.260]  Petraeus coming up his a recap of the bin Laden fable dr. Pacinic great to
[01:11:02.260 --> 01:11:13.580]  have you with us whether I said it was gonna happen ten years later or it
[01:11:13.580 --> 01:11:17.740]  happened he's dead so we let's finish with that for a moment and then we'll
[01:11:17.740 --> 01:11:22.060]  lead to the other issue of false flag which it's not in the Middle East the
[01:11:22.060 --> 01:11:25.900]  Middle East war now that we have is not a false flag it's a real war that's
[01:11:25.900 --> 01:11:30.780]  going on on curb covert operations and by the way I will lead into the man who's
[01:11:30.780 --> 01:11:35.700]  leading that covert operation is a very brave man and that's Petraeus I've
[01:11:35.700 --> 01:11:39.780]  always had a great admiration for him since he was a major general and I
[01:11:39.780 --> 01:11:45.220]  picked off his modus operandi where he's very creative he's very proactive
[01:11:45.220 --> 01:11:50.740]  he's the man who like many of our senior military officials has a PhD and a
[01:11:50.740 --> 01:11:55.300]  master's degree there are others Keith Alexander McAllister all of whom have
[01:11:55.300 --> 01:12:00.620]  been trained and have other degrees beyond being warriors and I think what's
[01:12:00.620 --> 01:12:04.420]  important now is to understand that Petraeus as I said a year ago would make
[01:12:04.420 --> 01:12:07.700]  a great president I would make an excellent vice president but quite
[01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:12.740]  frankly my take is that as much as I would respect Drudge or any other
[01:12:12.740 --> 01:12:18.740]  report I don't think Petraeus would come out right now we do need him in a
[01:12:18.740 --> 01:12:23.860]  major war that is going on that is not a false flag that is not a stand-down and
[01:12:23.860 --> 01:12:29.660]  that is the civil war that's going on in Syria which is being handled quite
[01:12:29.660 --> 01:12:34.220]  quietly and I must admit effectively by this administration because you have
[01:12:34.220 --> 01:12:39.180]  several professional number one doc Petraeus himself who's running a covert
[01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:45.460]  operation it's involving our own CIA and other units coming out of Israel Saudi
[01:12:45.460 --> 01:12:53.420]  Arabia Turkey Qatar and then you have Iran and Russia and other elements
[01:12:53.420 --> 01:12:56.820]  involved in the counter force and what's really going on the Middle East now
[01:12:56.820 --> 01:13:01.460]  and it's interesting that neither Romney nor Obama have talked about it is that
[01:13:01.460 --> 01:13:06.340]  we do we have a real war going on between Sunnis and Shiites this is not a
[01:13:06.340 --> 01:13:11.380]  false flag this is not a stand-down this is not an attempt by anybody to suppress
[01:13:11.380 --> 01:13:15.860]  information it's simply that no one talked about substance but isn't it a
[01:13:15.860 --> 01:13:20.820]  proxy war doctor it is a proxy war that's why General Petraeus now is
[01:13:20.820 --> 01:13:26.220]  important to maintaining that proxy war in terms of what it doesn't mean
[01:13:26.220 --> 01:13:32.140]  proxy the Saudis are funding Al-Qaeda and Salafist Salafist extreme Islamic
[01:13:32.140 --> 01:13:37.780]  fundamentalists who actually are fighting against the Iranian Revolutionary Guard
[01:13:37.780 --> 01:13:42.940]  and in fact against the Syrians now my own history with Syria is that it's not
[01:13:42.940 --> 01:13:47.340]  have been a very hopeful history but nevertheless I will tell you what happened
[01:13:47.340 --> 01:13:52.020]  I worked against Hafiz Assad and I was a we were I was part of a team that was
[01:13:52.020 --> 01:13:57.140]  effective in being able to bring him to a point in position during the Lebanese
[01:13:57.140 --> 01:14:01.420]  Civil War that's right you know and that's on that's on record tell folks
[01:14:01.420 --> 01:14:06.460]  about that well what happened is Hafiz Assad was continuously creating
[01:14:06.460 --> 01:14:11.540]  explosions and disruptions in the Middle East when we needed some
[01:14:11.540 --> 01:14:15.820]  cooperation that he eventually came to terms about 20 30 years ago on to the
[01:14:15.820 --> 01:14:19.380]  Reagan administration I give credit to the Secretary of State Schultz and
[01:14:19.380 --> 01:14:24.260]  others who were involved in bringing Syria as well the Israelis brought
[01:14:24.260 --> 01:14:30.300]  Syria the United States Israel and Syria came together and effectively agreed
[01:14:30.300 --> 01:14:36.100]  quietly that Syria would be in charge of Lebanon and control the PLO, PFLP and
[01:14:36.100 --> 01:14:41.580]  Hezbollah and in return Israel would pull back and not be concerned about
[01:14:41.580 --> 01:14:46.380]  terrorist activities and that was going on for 20 to 30 years up till now where
[01:14:46.380 --> 01:14:51.660]  Syria has been an effective surrogate in terms of maintaining peace and order
[01:14:51.660 --> 01:14:55.700]  their only interest in Lebanon was really the banking system it was nothing
[01:14:55.700 --> 01:15:00.860]  else now Syria is not a democracy nor is any other country in the Middle East
[01:15:00.860 --> 01:15:07.620]  except perhaps for Israel which is again quite questionable given the
[01:15:07.620 --> 01:15:13.580]  ultra orthodox status of the government at this point but the point of fact is
[01:15:13.580 --> 01:15:20.020]  neither Egypt, Qatar, Dubai, Saudi Arabia are Democrat democratic institutions
[01:15:20.020 --> 01:15:24.380]  they are autocratic they are theological and what is happening now is we have a
[01:15:24.380 --> 01:15:28.940]  major major war going on I was just in Turkey and interviewing Syrians
[01:15:28.940 --> 01:15:35.420]  Iranians Turks Kurds and what's happening despite the good efforts of the
[01:15:35.420 --> 01:15:39.540]  Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and two very experienced professionals in the
[01:15:39.540 --> 01:15:45.620]  State Department Nicholas Burns and Mark Grossman who's particularly an expert
[01:15:45.620 --> 01:15:51.340]  in Turkey and knows it very well he was our ambassador there we are there is a
[01:15:51.340 --> 01:15:56.260]  major proxy war that will divide Syria into the northern part either Kurds or
[01:15:56.260 --> 01:16:01.460]  northern Turkey the southern part will be part of Lebanon the eastern part goes
[01:16:01.460 --> 01:16:07.420]  into various elements of Iraq and what we have is an ongoing civil war full
[01:16:07.420 --> 01:16:12.420]  fledged the Israelis are now for the first time in real trouble since they've
[01:16:12.420 --> 01:16:17.380]  been in 1948 where three elements three different borders the northern border and
[01:16:17.380 --> 01:16:23.140]  Lebanon is exposed because Hezbollah is a proxy for Iran on the eastern border
[01:16:23.140 --> 01:16:27.180]  you have Salafist or Al-Qaeda units coming into Jordan and on the southern
[01:16:27.180 --> 01:16:32.100]  border as many of you know and they and your audience you have the Egyptian
[01:16:32.100 --> 01:16:37.260]  military now fighting Al-Qaeda and Salafist units at Saudi Arabia so Israel
[01:16:37.260 --> 01:16:42.820]  for the first time is confronting three borders of enemies and has to decide
[01:16:42.820 --> 01:16:47.820]  how what kind of a war it will implement and what kind of covert actions they
[01:16:47.820 --> 01:16:51.060]  would get involved with right now they are supporting Saudi Arabians and the
[01:16:51.060 --> 01:16:55.940]  Salafist in Syria but that can switch very quickly against Israel now you have
[01:16:55.940 --> 01:17:00.900]  Hamas fighting the actual Salafist in the Egyptian
[01:17:00.900 --> 01:17:14.300]  at present we need to trace more than we ever needed and before so from a point of
[01:17:14.300 --> 01:17:18.020]  view of Romney I think it would be a great choice I think poor men would be a
[01:17:18.020 --> 01:17:22.700]  great choice for Romney too but the point of fact is right now we need him in
[01:17:22.700 --> 01:17:26.980]  this administration with all due respect to drudge and the president I think the
[01:17:26.980 --> 01:17:32.100]  president has selected very well the key man who has to be able to run a
[01:17:32.100 --> 01:17:37.420]  covert operation alongside Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Brandon in the
[01:17:37.420 --> 01:17:41.700]  White House so we have a lot of professionals in the field running a
[01:17:41.700 --> 01:17:47.100]  very quiet war where honestly neither the president of Obama nor Romney has
[01:17:47.100 --> 01:17:51.860]  discussed this war nor has it brought up in the campaign and I think your
[01:17:51.860 --> 01:17:55.100]  audience the American audience should be aware of what's happening
[01:17:55.100 --> 01:18:00.500]  sure they've got Russian forces in there you've got Iranian Hezbollah forces all
[01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:05.260]  clashing but then Al Qaeda which even the CFR has been putting articles out
[01:18:05.260 --> 01:18:09.460]  praising what great fighters they are against Assad and again I know that you
[01:18:09.460 --> 01:18:16.220]  you know you know tried to stop us the Assad senior and his regime blowing stuff
[01:18:16.220 --> 01:18:21.500]  up a few decades ago but I mean why is the West helping get the Arab Spring
[01:18:21.500 --> 01:18:26.260]  going and then putting jihadis in in all these countries because aren't they in
[01:18:26.260 --> 01:18:30.900]  the final equation going to be worse than Assad or will they later say now
[01:18:30.900 --> 01:18:36.020]  we've got to invade again because Al Qaeda or you know jihadi types out of
[01:18:36.020 --> 01:18:41.380]  Saudi Arabia are going to take over and try to cleanse Muslim groups and
[01:18:41.380 --> 01:18:45.700]  Christian groups and others well Alex this is where you and I often come
[01:18:45.700 --> 01:18:49.980]  together and that's my personal point of view after leaving Turkey and
[01:18:49.980 --> 01:18:53.540]  interviewing and realizing that the situation is and then I will add a
[01:18:53.540 --> 01:18:58.540]  footnote not only was I against office of thought but I wasn't serious several
[01:18:58.540 --> 01:19:03.700]  years ago as a quote tourist but I wasn't interrogated by Bashir Assad and
[01:19:03.700 --> 01:19:08.900]  his people for six seven hours so I don't have any personal affection for
[01:19:08.900 --> 01:19:12.700]  them but I do have a respect professionally for Bashir Assad and the
[01:19:12.700 --> 01:19:16.900]  fact that he is protecting right now the Christians the Alawites who are
[01:19:16.900 --> 01:19:20.860]  really a variation of Christianity contrary to what most people think in
[01:19:20.860 --> 01:19:26.300]  1923 the French created the Alawites as quote an offshoot of Muslims he's also
[01:19:26.300 --> 01:19:32.900]  protecting the Jews the Jews and it's a very serious intelligence security
[01:19:32.900 --> 01:19:36.780]  apparatus that he's maintaining and you're absolutely correct my personal
[01:19:36.780 --> 01:19:40.580]  point of view is that we have once again allied ourselves with the real
[01:19:40.580 --> 01:19:46.100]  problem here and that is Al Qaeda I'm not a fan of Al Qaeda I never was a fan
[01:19:46.100 --> 01:19:51.300]  oh I said 30 years ago we created it a tail on Dr. Prashinik we've got to go
[01:19:51.300 --> 01:19:55.140]  to break stop there when we come back start back over 30 years ago when you
[01:19:55.140 --> 01:19:58.820]  warned the State Department and CIA not to work with Al Qaeda we'll be right
[01:19:58.820 --> 01:20:03.580]  back Alex Jones here with a very important announcement for truth
[01:20:03.580 --> 01:20:07.620]  speakers we've carried a lot of amazing films and books over the years on the

[01:23:15.500 --> 01:23:19.540]  senior Steve Forbes Margaret Thatcher and Boris Yeltsin to name but a few and
[01:23:19.540 --> 01:23:22.580]  his volume of work set out his groundbreaking financial newsletter
[01:23:22.580 --> 01:23:26.740]  strategic investment was so far ahead of its time it helped transform not
[01:23:26.740 --> 01:23:30.060]  just the fates and fortunes of thousands of investors but also the

[01:23:46.660 --> 01:23:51.060]  bring down the entire capitalist system go to fallofcapitalism.com to watch his
[01:23:51.060 --> 01:23:54.860]  controversial video before the powers that be wipe it from the internet again
[01:23:54.860 --> 01:24:00.180]  it's www.fallofcapitalism.com
[01:24:13.660 --> 01:24:19.540]  Dr. Steve Pachinic is our guest right now we got Webster Tarpley who's recently
[01:24:19.540 --> 01:24:25.340]  traveled over to Syria on the invite of the Assad regime to assess it
[01:24:25.340 --> 01:24:30.180]  himself joining us he was also in Libya during the NATO bombardment to kick out
[01:24:30.180 --> 01:24:34.780]  their old asset Gaddafi and now it has come out what Tarpley said over a year
[01:24:34.780 --> 01:24:39.900]  ago that Nicholas Sarkozy was on the payroll of Gaddafi that's why Gaddafi
[01:24:39.900 --> 01:24:44.460]  cozied up to the west and actually financed his election with the money so
[01:24:44.460 --> 01:24:49.100]  he's now basically been raided in his quasi hiding out may go on the run
[01:24:49.100 --> 01:24:55.220]  here's the issue we know they want to take out Syria before they go into Iran
[01:24:55.220 --> 01:25:01.340]  so that Syria can't attack through Lebanon with Hezbollah we know Israel in
[01:25:01.340 --> 01:25:06.580]  2007 basically got beaten by the anti-tank weapons but those weapons are
[01:25:06.580 --> 01:25:11.980]  still in place and so I see the big mega banks that are imploding the world
[01:25:11.980 --> 01:25:16.860]  economy right now wanting a big war and that may be why they're pushing through
[01:25:16.860 --> 01:25:20.220]  even though most the Israeli intelligence and others have said don't do
[01:25:20.220 --> 01:25:24.020]  this dr. Pashinik looking at just a wide picture in layman's terms because
[01:25:24.020 --> 01:25:27.900]  you've been involved at all levels of this over the last few decades and we
[01:25:27.900 --> 01:25:32.220]  left off dock with you saying 30 years ago you didn't want to work with Al Qaeda
[01:25:32.220 --> 01:25:37.780]  I mean I understand the elements of the West want to take out the Mullahs and
[01:25:37.780 --> 01:25:43.100]  Iran but I mean Saudi Arabia and Al Qaeda why give the whole Middle East over
[01:25:43.100 --> 01:25:49.060]  to Al Qaeda well the issue here is really and we don't have with all due
[01:25:49.060 --> 01:25:54.500]  respect to what you're saying for over 20 to 30 years the issue of the Middle
[01:25:54.500 --> 01:25:59.820]  East is not about Israel a general Petraeus said it very succinctly and
[01:25:59.820 --> 01:26:04.460]  very well several years ago when he said Israel's strategic liability that was
[01:26:04.460 --> 01:26:08.940]  not an anti-Semitic statement that was a very strategic statement the real
[01:26:08.940 --> 01:26:13.420]  issue in the Middle East has been over 20 to 30 years and I've been involved
[01:26:13.420 --> 01:26:18.060]  with the Iranians against the Iranians with them the real issue has been
[01:26:18.060 --> 01:26:23.300]  Sunni versus Shiite and what you're seeing now in Syria is the expansion of
[01:26:23.300 --> 01:26:29.100]  Iran going into Syria and basically stating today that this is a world war
[01:26:29.100 --> 01:26:34.140]  where we either Shiites want to dominate the Middle East and we will fight
[01:26:34.140 --> 01:26:40.100]  against the Sunni what happened is the CIA rightfully wrongfully 20 30 years
[01:26:40.100 --> 01:26:43.740]  ago and I agreed with what they did initially was to use Al Qaeda although
[01:26:43.740 --> 01:26:48.380]  I warned them of the blowback to fight the Afghans and the Russians and we
[01:26:48.380 --> 01:26:52.380]  successfully got rid of the Soviets during the period of Jimmy Carter and
[01:26:52.380 --> 01:26:56.860]  then Reagan and that was successful the problem is that every successful
[01:26:56.860 --> 01:27:02.500]  operation you you caught you create your own destruction years later and it's
[01:27:02.500 --> 01:27:08.180]  it's untoward consequences we don't often recognize that with all due respect to
[01:27:08.180 --> 01:27:13.380]  the CIA and intelligence bureaus we had a blowback and the blowback is that Al
[01:27:13.380 --> 01:27:18.460]  Qaeda came back the very people who we armed in Pakistan and the Taliban came
[01:27:18.460 --> 01:27:23.780]  back to fight us now we're in a world where there's not just good guys and
[01:27:23.780 --> 01:27:29.380]  bad guys we have the better of the worse we're talking about entities now that we
[01:27:29.380 --> 01:27:33.220]  don't really have national security interests other than saying we're going
[01:27:33.220 --> 01:27:37.940]  to have proxies fighting for us right now our interest in the Middle East is
[01:27:37.940 --> 01:27:42.180]  minimal we don't want to put soldiers on the ground or should we the American
[01:27:42.180 --> 01:27:47.020]  public is tired that's why I want both Obama and Romney to discuss this issue
[01:27:47.020 --> 01:27:52.060]  not in terms of war with Iran and nuclear proliferation or Israel versus
[01:27:52.060 --> 01:27:56.380]  Iran but really what is our national security interest in the Middle East we
[01:27:56.380 --> 01:28:00.700]  have proxies we have a very good ally in Turkey we have a good ally in Saudi
[01:28:00.700 --> 01:28:07.420]  Arabia Qatar Dubai the issue then becomes in those allies fighting Syria do we
[01:28:07.420 --> 01:28:12.580]  have a national security interest the answer is not really our national
[01:28:12.580 --> 01:28:17.620]  security interest is shifted correctly as Hillary Clinton said at the Pacific
[01:28:17.620 --> 01:28:23.460]  Ocean where we do have an expanse of China which is economically threatening
[01:28:23.460 --> 01:28:28.220]  us and many different levels and they have a potential coup I don't want to
[01:28:28.220 --> 01:28:32.060]  get everybody confused right now but what happened in that murder case had
[01:28:32.060 --> 01:28:36.380]  nothing to do with banking and nor did the bad the Middle East the Middle East
[01:28:36.380 --> 01:28:42.060]  is a strictly a war between Shiites and Sunnis at this particular point in time
[01:28:42.060 --> 01:28:46.460]  we've taken the Sunni position my suspicion is within a time due to the
[01:28:46.460 --> 01:28:52.180]  diplomacy and covert operations we will probably work with both sides Shiite
[01:28:52.180 --> 01:28:56.700]  and Sunni the problem will be for Israel to decide how we can maintain its
[01:28:56.700 --> 01:29:02.180]  viability in a world where it no longer becomes a prominent power going to war
[01:29:02.180 --> 01:29:06.500]  nuclear war is not an issue for them they can't sustain it they're not able to
[01:29:06.500 --> 01:29:11.980]  do that they have been defeated so the question then becomes from a body
[01:29:11.980 --> 01:29:16.860]  politic point of view what can Israel do versus the northern border their eastern
[01:29:16.860 --> 01:29:21.780]  border and their southern border we have a very good ally right now in Egypt the
[01:29:21.780 --> 01:29:26.580]  military has been very effective but the notion that's being propagated not on
[01:29:26.580 --> 01:29:30.700]  your show but in the media and CNN elsewhere that these fighters are
[01:29:30.700 --> 01:29:35.700]  fighting for democracy is absurd you have autocratic regimes throughout the
[01:29:35.700 --> 01:29:39.780]  entire Middle East the question becomes again and again what is the United
[01:29:39.780 --> 01:29:44.340]  States basic interest all right dog the bankers are not interested in this war
[01:29:44.340 --> 01:29:48.300]  I long segment pending from it sure long segment coming up we'll be able to break
[01:29:48.300 --> 01:29:52.500]  all this down and where you see it going we're on the March the Empire's on the
[01:29:52.500 --> 01:29:58.380]  run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[01:34:30.220 --> 01:34:33.780]  quote interest and you're saying the banksters don't even want this then why
[01:34:33.780 --> 01:34:38.020]  is Israel accelerating war even when the former massage chief and top generals
[01:34:38.020 --> 01:34:44.020]  and our own joint chief say don't do it why then do we see the media pushing for

[01:34:48.100 --> 01:34:52.940]  considerable understanding well the world is going in at a faster pace to
[01:34:52.940 --> 01:34:58.340]  correct Alex but I'm not as concerned about American America falling apart
[01:34:58.340 --> 01:35:03.220]  quite frankly I'm much more optimistic as to where we are in terms of country
[01:35:03.220 --> 01:35:09.940]  we're entrepreneurial we're seeding the effective at creating new businesses so
[01:35:09.940 --> 01:35:14.780]  I'm not I'm more optimistic than I've ever been and believe me I'm not that
[01:35:14.780 --> 01:35:21.020]  kind of you know you know an optimistic guy in general but the bottom line is
[01:35:21.020 --> 01:35:26.740]  very simple the Middle East now is breaking out because time and the
[01:35:26.740 --> 01:35:31.740]  Arab Spring really started out with Tunisia no one expected it moved very
[01:35:31.740 --> 01:35:37.540]  quickly Egypt and it moved to Libya and then it moved to Syria Syria is the
[01:35:37.540 --> 01:35:42.460]  fighting ground where the Iran basically said we Shiites we're a minority but we
[01:35:42.460 --> 01:35:46.860]  want to be the majority what will fight Saudi Arabia which controls the oil we
[01:35:46.860 --> 01:35:51.660]  want to be the predominant power caught in between all of this it's Israel which
[01:35:51.660 --> 01:35:56.580]  says in effect oh my god we've played with both sides Israel has been with Iran
[01:35:56.580 --> 01:36:02.580]  during the 89 war Israeli pilots flew against Iraqi pilots which we really
[01:36:02.580 --> 01:36:08.820]  flew for so the war in 89 between Iraq and Iran was really instigated by the
[01:36:08.820 --> 01:36:13.940]  United States and Israel to deplete the forces of both Iran and Iraq our
[01:36:13.940 --> 01:36:18.740]  national security interest at that time was to deplete Iraqi forces we then
[01:36:18.740 --> 01:36:23.180]  went in mistakingly thanks to Cheney who called this president the worst
[01:36:23.180 --> 01:36:27.340]  president United States he has the gall to do that it's one of the worst vice
[01:36:27.340 --> 01:36:32.380]  president to the history of our country he went to war and lied and sent troops
[01:36:32.380 --> 01:36:37.740]  in and and now we are paying the price of having created a disturbance in Iraq
[01:36:37.740 --> 01:36:43.740]  which is now falling apart where we put Shiites in charge and the Sunnis which
[01:36:43.740 --> 01:36:48.500]  were a minority I don't want to get confused are fighting in Syria to take
[01:36:48.500 --> 01:36:53.620]  over Syria and then they will fight come back to Iraq and reinstigate another
[01:36:53.620 --> 01:36:58.740]  war so basically our national security interest from the point of view what do
[01:36:58.740 --> 01:37:03.220]  we have bested in the Middle East at this point honestly the best thing we can
[01:37:03.220 --> 01:37:07.420]  do is to get out of there because it's not to our interest it's a war between
[01:37:07.420 --> 01:37:12.260]  the Shiites and the Sunnis the major interest that's here is an issue of
[01:37:12.260 --> 01:37:17.940]  Christianity I'm concerning I said it repeatedly to the Coptic Christians in
[01:37:17.940 --> 01:37:22.780]  Egypt in the United States that you are in danger of having Sharia you are in
[01:37:22.780 --> 01:37:28.380]  Dane being killed it's an original Christian sect and the same issue for
[01:37:28.380 --> 01:37:33.300]  me is in Syria where Bashir Assad is literally and so the Soviets the
[01:37:33.300 --> 01:37:37.920]  Russians are protecting the Christians they're in the millions so the issue of
[01:37:37.920 --> 01:37:42.620]  Christianity is becoming paramount and no one is discussing them I'm quite
[01:37:42.620 --> 01:37:48.460]  frankly tired of keeping on saying Christianity is a problem here and we
[01:37:48.460 --> 01:37:53.380]  do have an interest in maintaining the viability of the Christians in Syria and
[01:37:53.380 --> 01:37:58.820]  in Egypt we can do that by supporting Assad unfortunately we don't have a
[01:37:58.820 --> 01:38:03.500]  choice as to democracy or non democracy and quite frankly Russia and who I
[01:38:03.500 --> 01:38:07.860]  worked against is also protecting the Christians from my point of view the
[01:38:07.860 --> 01:38:12.020]  Christian viability is far more important to our national interest than any
[01:38:12.020 --> 01:38:16.820]  financial interest there are no bankers who are interested but let me just say
[01:38:16.820 --> 01:38:22.020]  the Soviets quite frankly our old ten billion dollars now by Syria and Syria
[01:38:22.020 --> 01:38:26.740]  is not paying them for the armaments so Russia is going into debt and being
[01:38:26.740 --> 01:38:30.820]  tied down in the Mediterranean which from a strategic point of view I'm very
[01:38:30.820 --> 01:38:34.740]  happy but I'm also pleased that at least Putin is willing to protect the
[01:38:34.740 --> 01:38:39.220]  Christians Israel cannot at this point and I know you famously worked against
[01:38:39.220 --> 01:38:43.420]  the Russians I mean to get it that's correct all of my enemies have become
[01:38:43.420 --> 01:38:47.620]  somewhat of a national security interest to me now I was interrogated by
[01:38:47.620 --> 01:38:53.460]  Shirazat for five six hours but I saw the effectiveness he had in protecting
[01:38:53.460 --> 01:38:57.380]  minorities so that's right I read that he had you arrested didn't he that's
[01:38:57.380 --> 01:39:01.260]  correct yeah he did for six hours and then he asked me how we could do business
[01:39:01.260 --> 01:39:05.700]  together but the point of fact is that even when you're arrested and you spend
[01:39:05.700 --> 01:39:10.020]  time and I was willing to go there on my own and I knew what the consequences were
[01:39:10.020 --> 01:39:13.460]  you know this is not an issue of a government this is an issue of my
[01:39:13.460 --> 01:39:17.820]  personal choice I made a choice I knew what the consequences were well quite
[01:39:17.820 --> 01:39:22.260]  frankly I had a very good relationship with the Assad regime even after they
[01:39:22.260 --> 01:39:27.540]  knew who I was my point here right now is that we the leaders of our country
[01:39:27.540 --> 01:39:32.220]  have to address these issues in a sober systematic way because I know I
[01:39:32.220 --> 01:39:36.180]  understand but the media doc is just hyping war war war so so so break it
[01:39:36.180 --> 01:39:41.220]  down in layman's terms but in terms you've got look I can't control the
[01:39:41.220 --> 01:39:45.540]  media the New York Times the Washington Post CNN you know they're looking for
[01:39:45.540 --> 01:39:50.700]  that sensationalist the real issue in layman's term is this is a war between
[01:39:50.700 --> 01:39:56.180]  Shiites and Sunnis that's been there for generations it's being reflected right
[01:39:56.180 --> 01:40:02.300]  now in Syria with a lot of proxies Turkey, Russia, Syria,
[01:40:02.300 --> 01:40:10.060]  Alawites, Christians, very few Jews, Sunnis, Salafis who extremists, Egypt, and
[01:40:10.060 --> 01:40:16.300]  Saudi Arabia all of which are proxies to our national interest other than the
[01:40:16.300 --> 01:40:20.980]  religious viability no bankers are making money out of this okay but let's back
[01:40:20.980 --> 01:40:24.460]  this up then I understand there's a bunch of you know different groups and
[01:40:24.460 --> 01:40:28.740]  the West is starting with Saudi Arabia and I've always known Saudi Arabia is a
[01:40:28.740 --> 01:40:32.780]  lot more powerful force than the media you know ever points out because it is
[01:40:32.780 --> 01:40:36.700]  so powerful because its money has been invested everywhere and it's just
[01:40:36.700 --> 01:40:41.860]  unbelievably corrupt and out of control and but but we're supposed to ignore all
[01:40:41.860 --> 01:40:47.300]  that but pulling back then knowing the area you know unlike you know many
[01:40:47.300 --> 01:40:51.540]  people even in your field how did the whole Arab Spring start where is it
[01:40:51.540 --> 01:40:57.620]  going why did Anderson Cooper and other people you know talk about how great it
[01:40:57.620 --> 01:41:02.340]  was what's happening in Egypt as they you know persecute Christians and Jews
[01:41:02.340 --> 01:41:07.740]  and people I mean how did our government get to the point of publicly
[01:41:07.740 --> 01:41:13.380]  throwing its lot in with jihadis in Al Qaeda and the Muslim Brotherhood well
[01:41:13.380 --> 01:41:19.380]  that's a very good question number one let me tell you 1973 I was first taught
[01:41:19.380 --> 01:41:24.180]  at MIT about a phenomenon called the Internet and social media so the
[01:41:24.180 --> 01:41:28.860]  notion that Zuckerberg created social media that was you know suddenly was
[01:41:28.860 --> 01:41:33.220]  created that's that's false it was done by DARPA Defense Advanced Research
[01:41:33.220 --> 01:41:40.300]  Projects Agency and the CIA back in 1973 Tunisia was the first spontaneous
[01:41:40.300 --> 01:41:46.460]  Arab Spring where they went against the corrupt authoritarian regime and there
[01:41:46.460 --> 01:41:51.340]  was the beginning of the Arab Spring our intelligence community sustained
[01:41:51.340 --> 01:41:58.980]  another Arab Spring rightfully wrongfully in Egypt take out Mubarak the issue of
[01:41:58.980 --> 01:42:04.420]  corruption with Mubarak was very serious and also it was serious these are the
[01:42:04.420 --> 01:42:09.100]  not the Islamic Brotherhood but really the military and whether the military
[01:42:09.100 --> 01:42:13.940]  would tolerate Mubarak's son's corruption and that was an issue for a long
[01:42:13.940 --> 01:42:18.220]  time never discussed that but I was involved in putting Mubarak there after
[01:42:18.220 --> 01:42:23.460]  Sadat so we knew exactly how effective Mubarak would be from that point on
[01:42:23.460 --> 01:42:28.540]  several important intelligence operatives were arrested for things that they felt
[01:42:28.540 --> 01:42:33.100]  was important to democracy but in the world where you can't choose good guys
[01:42:33.100 --> 01:42:38.540]  and bad guys you sometimes have to choose the lesser evil of the two and in
[01:42:38.540 --> 01:42:44.740]  case of Syria that may be a sign for reasons that I'm I don't agree with but
[01:42:44.740 --> 01:42:50.140]  I understand that we've chosen to go with the Sunni so the Muslim Brotherhood in
[01:42:50.140 --> 01:42:54.500]  Egypt believe me is nothing compared and this is very complicated but I have
[01:42:54.500 --> 01:42:58.580]  to explain it the Muslim Brotherhood or the Islamic Brotherhood is nothing
[01:42:58.580 --> 01:43:03.940]  compared to what Saudi Arabia produces and you write right Alex the core and
[01:43:03.940 --> 01:43:08.220]  the core of the problem here the center of gravity is really Saudi Arabia it has
[01:43:08.220 --> 01:43:14.180]  always been a problem the Saudis do not have really a nation state it is a it is
[01:43:14.180 --> 01:43:21.380]  a feudal it is a corrupt entity with many princes which don't exist in Islam
[01:43:21.380 --> 01:43:26.300]  where they use the notion that they have protectors of Mecca Medina as a false
[01:43:26.300 --> 01:43:34.060]  ideology to maintain a group of fighters called Salafis or Islamic extremists we
[01:43:34.060 --> 01:43:39.260]  use them they were expedient at that time whether we need to use them now no
[01:43:39.260 --> 01:43:43.780]  but they're being used right now and and those who are involved with it know
[01:43:43.780 --> 01:43:47.340]  that there will be a blowback from this because those Salafis who are fighting
[01:43:47.340 --> 01:43:52.580]  in Syria supported by Saudi Arabia and Qatar will eventually go back to Iraq
[01:43:52.580 --> 01:43:57.940]  which is a Shia country control now and create more problem why we do certain
[01:43:57.940 --> 01:44:02.020]  things we do it because we have certain leaders and we have certain controls of
[01:44:02.020 --> 01:44:06.820]  non-controls but we don't have an open discussion as we should have in the body
[01:44:06.820 --> 01:44:11.300]  politics this may be the first discussion I have ever heard why Anderson Cooper talks
[01:44:11.300 --> 01:44:15.820]  about this number one I mean you'd have to enjoy Anderson could be the very
[01:44:15.820 --> 01:44:21.620]  narcissistic I think very infantile individual who really served at the CIA as
[01:44:21.620 --> 01:44:26.700]  an internship so his agenda is not exactly to give you the news it is to
[01:44:26.700 --> 01:44:31.580]  propagate certain elements of the CIA notion that we were fighting for
[01:44:31.580 --> 01:44:35.980]  freedom we're not fighting for freedom we were changing regimes it's a sloppy way
[01:44:35.980 --> 01:44:39.980]  to do it I don't agree with it I've been in the business the regime change we
[01:44:39.980 --> 01:44:44.180]  don't need all these operatives don't need of the military but the important
[01:44:44.180 --> 01:44:49.140]  point to understand now is we're now in a different scenario where we are in a
[01:44:49.140 --> 01:44:53.660]  business of choosing the better of the worse and right now I'm a little bit more
[01:44:53.660 --> 01:44:58.580]  optimistic than I was before this is not a conspiracy this is not the bankers of
[01:44:58.580 --> 01:45:02.500]  the world this is not a Zionist conspiracy there are real issues that
[01:45:02.500 --> 01:45:07.140]  have to be dealt with the president I think is doing as well as he can he's
[01:45:07.140 --> 01:45:11.700]  not getting credit for it because simply he hasn't discussed it and in turn you
[01:45:11.700 --> 01:45:15.180]  have Brandon who's in the White House doing everything he can on counter
[01:45:15.180 --> 01:45:20.980]  terrorism you have Petraeus and the CIA exceedingly effective general who
[01:45:20.980 --> 01:45:26.100]  understands limitations the CIA remembers not a monolithic entity as well as
[01:45:26.100 --> 01:45:29.340]  working with military intelligence I don't want to get in the component and
[01:45:29.340 --> 01:45:33.940]  trying to avoid bringing in our soldiers into an area where we can no longer
[01:45:33.940 --> 01:45:39.100]  fight or want to fight so we're limited by our full expansion of power at the
[01:45:39.100 --> 01:45:43.860]  same time Obama and Hillary Clinton correctly said we're shifting our balance
[01:45:43.860 --> 01:45:49.340]  to the Pacific that means Vietnam Indonesia Cambodia which I was
[01:45:49.340 --> 01:45:54.500]  involved in and trying to limit and they contain the expansion of China which
[01:45:54.500 --> 01:45:59.460]  is an economic threat to us because of their ability to lower their prices and
[01:45:59.460 --> 01:46:04.660]  be able to economically dominate the world where we can't compete well let me
[01:46:04.660 --> 01:46:09.140]  ask you this question then I want to pull back to the larger geopolitical field
[01:46:09.140 --> 01:46:15.860]  here in your gut what do you expect to happen now with the Iran attack with
[01:46:15.860 --> 01:46:22.020]  these proxy wars with the encirclement of China with all the power machinations
[01:46:22.020 --> 01:46:26.140]  that are going on over there because you know people email me they call in and
[01:46:26.140 --> 01:46:31.860]  they say Alex why are you supporting Russia and Assad I'm not it's a country
[01:46:31.860 --> 01:46:36.300]  sitting there that it has not been in an aggressive stance for a long time and
[01:46:36.300 --> 01:46:40.140]  then now they're going to put a bunch of jihadis in there they're going to kill
[01:46:40.140 --> 01:46:45.300]  all the Christians and Jews and I am against these aggressive wars I mean
[01:46:45.300 --> 01:46:51.500]  it's a very simple thing of you know not supporting aggressive wars and but all
[01:46:51.500 --> 01:46:55.820]  these other countries think in proxies and what they can get in subterfuge so I
[01:46:55.820 --> 01:47:00.020]  get the point of then our system becomes subterfuge but when you dance with the
[01:47:00.020 --> 01:47:03.620]  devil the devil doesn't change you change and I see our Bill of Rights and
[01:47:03.620 --> 01:47:07.340]  Constitution going out the door I see Homeland Security setting up check
[01:47:07.340 --> 01:47:11.660]  points everywhere I see them openly preparing the Secretary of the Army for
[01:47:11.660 --> 01:47:17.340]  troops in America Dr. Pachinic what are they getting ready for I don't think
[01:47:17.340 --> 01:47:20.940]  we're getting ready for anything quite frankly Alex with all due respect to
[01:47:20.940 --> 01:47:25.780]  your analysis I think it's correct in one way I think Assad in Syria is going to
[01:47:25.780 --> 01:47:31.140]  be handled by our regional allies and what I mean by that is we have a very
[01:47:31.140 --> 01:47:36.220]  good man in Mark Grossman in the trade I can't emphasize that enough because the
[01:47:36.220 --> 01:47:40.580]  feet on the ground now is not a soldier it's a diplomat and that diplomat in
[01:47:40.580 --> 01:47:45.900]  particular Grossman knows Turkey extremely well Turkey is our closest ally
[01:47:45.900 --> 01:47:53.220]  and Turkey will be our proxy to negotiate a stability a piece that will
[01:47:53.220 --> 01:47:58.340]  entail using Russia Erdogan is very good in dealing with Putin and maintaining
[01:47:58.340 --> 01:48:02.900]  the peace over Syria if it fractionates it'll fractionate along Al-Awaid and
[01:48:02.900 --> 01:48:07.820]  Kurdish but Turkey has to be careful of Kurds at the same time Saudi Arabia will
[01:48:07.820 --> 01:48:12.340]  have to pull back as well as Iran will pull back and the United States will
[01:48:12.340 --> 01:48:18.540]  maintain the balance between the Shiites the Sunnis the Russians and and this is
[01:48:18.540 --> 01:48:24.580]  where I find we're far better positioned than anybody thinks having said that all
[01:48:24.580 --> 01:48:28.540]  I wanted to have is to make sure that people understand this is not a false
[01:48:28.540 --> 01:48:33.380]  flag this is not alliance with that with a devil that you don't understand it is
[01:48:33.380 --> 01:48:37.700]  a world that we are now hanging into a reality of balance of power which has
[01:48:37.700 --> 01:48:42.700]  always been an issue the issue has always been who is in strategic balance
[01:48:42.700 --> 01:48:46.820]  who will predominate in the Middle East right now it's between Shiite and Sunni
[01:48:46.820 --> 01:48:51.020]  we are leaving the Middle East we don't have that financial issue by the way
[01:48:51.020 --> 01:48:56.700]  Saudi Arabia no longer produces our oil and okay then why did the West stage
[01:48:56.700 --> 01:49:02.540]  9-11 and go in to the Middle East and suddenly you have to fact mr. Cheney
[01:49:02.540 --> 01:49:05.700]  for that the man who accused our president president of being the worst
[01:49:05.700 --> 01:49:08.940]  president of the United States I have said for 20 years that Cheney should
[01:49:08.940 --> 01:49:13.020]  have been in prison I have repeatedly said I've known Cheney since we worked
[01:49:13.020 --> 01:49:17.460]  together in the Nixon administration is a despicable man he's a man who should
[01:49:17.460 --> 01:49:23.460]  have been arrested he has violated the Constitution he refused to serve in our
[01:49:23.460 --> 01:49:27.500]  on our war no I understand let me ask you this from your research my point is
[01:49:27.500 --> 01:49:33.100]  one man brought us to war and now one man criticizes this president and then
[01:49:33.100 --> 01:49:39.820]  emphasizes our need to go to further war it's beyond despicable and that man
[01:49:39.820 --> 01:49:43.900]  should have been held accountable that nonsense about a hot transplant that
[01:49:43.900 --> 01:49:49.020]  was done by dr. Fritz a long time before he announced it when he announced it
[01:49:49.020 --> 01:49:54.300]  the man lies he's pathological liar he's alcoholic and what I'm saying is an
[01:49:54.300 --> 01:49:58.540]  individual can bring you to war when there's no need for war but he's never
[01:49:58.540 --> 01:50:02.340]  been held accountable and that's where America has to come through reality
[01:50:02.340 --> 01:50:06.220]  well doc let me ask you this because I want to you know at the end here coming
[01:50:06.220 --> 01:50:09.420]  back from break in fact let's just skip this break right now we're gonna skip
[01:50:09.420 --> 01:50:12.300]  this network break right now so we have 10 minutes left for dr. Pachanik here
[01:50:12.300 --> 01:50:17.060]  gonna be technical nine minutes break down from your research why you said
[01:50:17.060 --> 01:50:21.260]  day one as a member of the council on farm relations at the time and still with
[01:50:21.260 --> 01:50:25.540]  a lot of courage that it was an inside job of my show 10 years ago or almost 10
[01:50:25.540 --> 01:50:28.780]  years ago why you broke down the fact that bin Laden was already dead which the
[01:50:28.780 --> 01:50:35.100]  you know the evidence shows why you sure sure because I was trying to warn the
[01:50:35.100 --> 01:50:39.300]  American public that we would go to war in Iraq and the reasons for the war were
[01:50:39.300 --> 01:50:45.900]  deceptive were lies and that they was created by chaining and bush jr. and by
[01:50:45.900 --> 01:50:51.220]  rungsfeld and others who were involved had Lee who was the chief of staff and
[01:50:51.220 --> 01:50:54.380]  others who were the sure here's my next question I've never asked you this from
[01:50:54.380 --> 01:50:58.060]  your research knowing how this stuff works how did they pull off something
[01:50:58.060 --> 01:51:00.740]  that big I mean I understand you don't know the full operation you just know
[01:51:00.740 --> 01:51:04.260]  they don't know the full operation because I taught it at the National War
[01:51:04.260 --> 01:51:09.940]  College okay Justin what did they do on 9-11 what they did on 9-11 I don't want
[01:51:09.940 --> 01:51:13.260]  to go back into it but basically they realigned everything that we had in
[01:51:13.260 --> 01:51:17.100]  FEMA they had everything that in terms of the FAA we don't have to go in
[01:51:17.100 --> 01:51:20.780]  specific thank you the logistics you're gonna have to look at the Air Force who
[01:51:20.780 --> 01:51:24.900]  was in charge of the Air Force what the false flags were who were the generals
[01:51:24.900 --> 01:51:29.100]  at time this is not what we have right now what we have it exceedingly
[01:51:29.100 --> 01:51:33.420]  responsible general I understand that people need to know historically no
[01:51:33.420 --> 01:51:38.220]  you have to understand that if they want to go back and spend that time now
[01:51:38.220 --> 01:51:42.300]  we're we're losing time to really understand where we're heading in much
[01:51:42.300 --> 01:51:46.860]  faster time Alex that's what I know but they use 9-11 to have the military
[01:51:46.860 --> 01:51:51.340]  industrial complex start setting up a police state here we need to kill the
[01:51:51.340 --> 01:51:55.660]  myth of 9-11 not just to get us out of Iraq but to get the TSA out of my pants
[01:51:55.660 --> 01:51:59.860]  want to kill the myth of 9-11 then bring Cheney and Bush jr. before trial and
[01:51:59.860 --> 01:52:03.580]  jury and approximately dog here's the thing I want to take my kids I want to
[01:52:03.580 --> 01:52:06.980]  be able to take my kids to Disney World without a fat pedophile abusing them
[01:52:06.980 --> 01:52:11.260]  okay so nobody's gonna look look let me tell you that let's get it clear the
[01:52:11.260 --> 01:52:15.700]  feds have been talking their job and they've been doing it very effective
[01:52:15.700 --> 01:52:20.740]  what happened recently with the killer who has been accused of where we went
[01:52:20.740 --> 01:52:24.340]  to the Sikhs and it was said that he was trained by the army to be a killer it's
[01:52:24.340 --> 01:52:30.660]  nonsense the army didn't train mr. Page to be a killer the army trained had him
[01:52:30.660 --> 01:52:36.340]  in he was in there he was a neo-nazi the feds the FBI in particular have been
[01:52:36.340 --> 01:52:42.500]  exceedingly good at breaking up neo-nazi exceedingly good however thanks to 9-11
[01:52:42.500 --> 01:52:46.980]  and Cheney in particular and Michael Hayden General Hayden who monitored
[01:52:46.980 --> 01:52:52.820]  everybody during 9-11 we had the FBI had to pull back dealers are very very
[01:52:52.820 --> 01:52:57.820]  responsible for what I'm saying is I'm sick of the TSA and the checkpoints we
[01:52:57.820 --> 01:53:02.820]  have to kill them at the 9-11 briefly I have no I have no problem with the TSA
[01:53:02.820 --> 01:53:06.820]  being disbanded and only secure no I know but but but here's the deal then
[01:53:06.820 --> 01:53:10.940]  briefly I mean obviously yes Cheney took the power for norad this to shoot
[01:53:10.940 --> 01:53:15.140]  downs the month before gave it back after 9-11 they had drills of the targets
[01:53:15.140 --> 01:53:18.820]  being hit so that's how I mean we know about the stand down but basically from
[01:53:18.820 --> 01:53:22.900]  what I know correct me if I'm wrong the the hijackers were doing drills of
[01:53:22.900 --> 01:53:27.980]  of infiltrating airports and getting on board for the Department of Defense and
[01:53:27.980 --> 01:53:32.500]  CIA they were set up nerve gas was released on the aircraft because the
[01:53:32.500 --> 01:53:36.140]  people said their smoke we can't breathe then remote control plume of the
[01:53:36.140 --> 01:53:41.060]  buildings let's let's get back to the issue do we need the TSA no I've had
[01:53:41.060 --> 01:53:45.620]  problems with them they rip off the luggage you've had the lowest level
[01:53:45.620 --> 01:53:51.340]  quality employees coming in they literally lift a ripped off and stole a
[01:53:51.340 --> 01:53:57.460]  class 3 drug that I had which it was a sleeping pill you have the worst of the
[01:53:57.460 --> 01:54:02.580]  worst thing brought in thanks to churn off thanks to the neocons and yeah they
[01:54:02.580 --> 01:54:07.540]  robbed me they stole Alex I want your audience to address that issue yes
[01:54:07.540 --> 01:54:13.700]  secondly do we need them no is that an issue for us no is internal securing
[01:54:13.700 --> 01:54:18.460]  issue yes but it has to be balanced by the liberties that's why the FBI has
[01:54:18.460 --> 01:54:24.580]  been very responsible on this issue the TSA is a totally useless organization
[01:54:24.580 --> 01:54:29.500]  which should have been thrown out years ago and it was set up by the neocons we
[01:54:29.500 --> 01:54:34.700]  don't have a TSA in Europe or Turkey where I had a lot of Muslims and a lot
[01:54:34.700 --> 01:54:38.940]  of potential problems and they don't have that so what I'm saying to you let's
[01:54:38.940 --> 01:54:43.860]  address the present issues but let's go on to it let us give to Caesar that which
[01:54:43.860 --> 01:54:49.780]  belongs to Caesar the FBI has done an incredible job on domestic issues of
[01:54:49.780 --> 01:54:57.060]  terrorism without suppression of liberty on issues of neo-nazis of domestic
[01:54:57.060 --> 01:55:01.020]  terrorism and other concerns if they wanted to suppress our liberties
[01:55:01.020 --> 01:55:06.140]  believe me they don't have that capability the internal spanning or
[01:55:06.140 --> 01:55:10.620]  electronic eavesdropping that we had came directly from the NSA under a
[01:55:10.620 --> 01:55:14.340]  general Michael Hayden never been brought to the he's never been brought
[01:55:14.340 --> 01:55:19.420]  forth because he has been brought in on I think mr. Romney has him
[01:55:19.420 --> 01:55:24.180]  unfortunately as part of the neocon group but the issue is no one has been
[01:55:24.180 --> 01:55:28.580]  held accountable for 9-11 the same way in the banking system nobody's gone to
[01:55:28.580 --> 01:55:33.580]  prison now the reason I go on your show is very simple I don't need to promote
[01:55:33.580 --> 01:55:37.620]  what I have or read my books if you know I'd not interested really talking about
[01:55:37.620 --> 01:55:42.220]  myself what I'm interested in saying is America wake up we're not as bad as we
[01:55:42.220 --> 01:55:45.860]  think and we're not as great as we would like to be we do have to have
[01:55:45.860 --> 01:55:51.100]  responsible representation the issue of a president is that domestically most
[01:55:51.100 --> 01:55:55.340]  presidents don't have as much powers but that people think domestically the
[01:55:55.340 --> 01:55:59.420]  only time a president of the United States has power is internationally they
[01:55:59.420 --> 01:56:04.540]  go to war that's why Bush Jr. went to war Cheney went to war and they created a
[01:56:04.540 --> 01:56:09.380]  false flag and Rumsfeld said it very clearly if you blame us Republicans for
[01:56:09.380 --> 01:56:15.420]  this false flag then you blame Franklin Roosevelt Wolfowitz was a father of
[01:56:15.420 --> 01:56:20.660]  this plan because he studied stand-down under in the University Chicago
[01:56:20.660 --> 01:56:26.260]  Richard Pearl zombie Halizat the list is endless sure they were under Lemnitzer
[01:56:26.260 --> 01:56:30.980]  they were under Lemnitzer well they're not on the limit so they were trained by
[01:56:30.980 --> 01:56:35.780]  a wolf stetter Chicago when I was at MIT we knew about this this is not a you
[01:56:35.780 --> 01:56:40.500]  know this is not unknown stand-down and false flag was created under Roosevelt
[01:56:40.500 --> 01:56:45.660]  is created on LLBJ it's not a it's not a privileged any one administration I
[01:56:45.660 --> 01:56:51.180]  know yeah Republicans and Democrats have had it my point now Alex is we can work
[01:56:51.180 --> 01:56:55.380]  on the past but we deal with the present in the future our biggest problem now for
[01:56:55.380 --> 01:57:00.300]  our military has nothing to do with banking not even the Middle East it
[01:57:00.300 --> 01:57:05.820]  has to do with cyber warfare which is going on every day now and a bill like
[01:57:05.820 --> 01:57:11.140]  was failed in the Senate to support cyber warfare which we need to support
[01:57:11.140 --> 01:57:16.740]  because every minute of every day we're being attacked by countless entities all
[01:57:16.740 --> 01:57:20.780]  around the world I'm not blaming one country but China is effective in that
[01:57:20.780 --> 01:57:25.220]  and we have not integrated our cyber warfare capacity between the military
[01:57:25.220 --> 01:57:30.340]  and the private companies and and I and I don't know the specifics of the bill
[01:57:30.340 --> 01:57:35.260]  but it failed in the Senate and here we have a real problem this is not about
[01:57:35.260 --> 01:57:39.220]  suppressing our freedoms or anything else it's about maintaining the
[01:57:39.220 --> 01:57:43.860]  viability or our infrastructure if we don't address that issue you can forget
[01:57:43.860 --> 01:57:47.980]  the Middle East you can pick a China because one electron can take down a
[01:57:47.980 --> 01:57:52.820]  hydroelectric capacity all the way from Quebec down to Miami those are the
[01:57:52.820 --> 01:57:56.780]  issues that you should be addressed all right well doc listen I really appreciate

[02:01:08.780 --> 02:01:14.060]  Qaeda is brave and good I'm a monkey's uncle and I want potbelly pedophiles to

[02:01:18.700 --> 02:01:23.620]  all this stupid paranoia okay and let me tell you the military is gearing up for
[02:01:23.620 --> 02:01:30.780]  martial law in this country in a giant Iran attack just that simple and they
[02:01:30.780 --> 02:01:34.060]  stage 9-11 they could stage anything we're in a lot of trouble and I'm tired
[02:01:34.060 --> 02:01:37.940]  of it I want my country back I don't want to be a slave it's real simple I
[02:01:37.940 --> 02:01:42.460]  don't want foreign banks overrunning us and robbing the Treasury Jim in
[02:01:42.460 --> 02:01:47.460]  Minnesota you're on the air thanks for holding brother go ahead yeah Alex yes
[02:01:47.460 --> 02:01:54.580]  sir yeah I had some comments I don't quite understand I've been a citizen for
[02:01:54.580 --> 02:02:04.900]  constitutional Republic since 1990 and it just seems to me that if we take a dog
[02:02:04.900 --> 02:02:13.260]  license from the federal government that we shouldn't be surprised how they treat
[02:02:13.260 --> 02:02:18.340]  us are you familiar with the power of visitation now you're getting into a
[02:02:18.340 --> 02:02:23.740]  bunch of patriot legal stuff about what type of citizen you are versus being
[02:02:23.740 --> 02:02:27.140]  part of the whole corporate globalist fiction I know there's a lot of truth to
[02:02:27.140 --> 02:02:30.660]  that the problem is the globalist don't care they bomb whatever country they
[02:02:30.660 --> 02:02:35.660]  drone whatever country they put poison in the vaccines they're lawless flagrant
[02:02:35.660 --> 02:02:40.500]  criminals because we haven't gotten in their face and denounce them as scum
[02:02:40.500 --> 02:02:46.380]  it's an info war all the legalese and stuff Jim just doesn't really go
[02:02:46.380 --> 02:02:49.940]  anywhere because they don't care I mean I do think if you get out of their
[02:02:49.940 --> 02:02:54.660]  system and you want to effectively choose that route that does hurt them when
[02:02:54.660 --> 02:02:57.660]  people just don't comply with any other just do whatever you want they're
[02:02:57.660 --> 02:03:01.980]  almost powerless the problem is in it's hard to operate in a large scale

[02:08:55.980 --> 02:09:00.060]  with us via cell phone as he drives to a TV interview for about 30 minutes then
[02:09:00.060 --> 02:09:04.780]  we'll take some calls and then popping in he just won his primary up in Michigan
[02:09:04.780 --> 02:09:09.460]  for Congress that's right Kurt Haskell who witnessed the federal government
[02:09:09.460 --> 02:09:16.100]  getting the underwear bomber on the plane to blame the to blame the Jihadis so
[02:09:16.100 --> 02:09:20.180]  they could have a pretext to have TSA roll out the body scanners he's gonna
[02:09:20.180 --> 02:09:25.060]  be popping in for about 10 minutes as well to talk about that victory so far
[02:09:25.060 --> 02:09:30.180]  and we'll also get into Parkinson's suffer arrested for not smiling an
[02:09:30.180 --> 02:09:35.540]  Olympic men's cycling race this is the total paranoia of the 1984 police state
[02:09:35.540 --> 02:09:40.820]  actually in 1984 if you didn't smile during the 10 minutes of hate while
[02:09:40.820 --> 02:09:47.540]  worshipping BB big brother you would be taken away to the ministry of love and
[02:09:47.540 --> 02:09:54.620]  then of course a propagandist all worked at the ministry of truth war is peace
[02:09:54.860 --> 02:09:59.500]  freedom is of course a bad thing now we're gonna be talking to Dr. Webster
[02:09:59.500 --> 02:10:04.740]  Tarpley a doctor of history doctor of history also an economist about his
[02:10:04.740 --> 02:10:11.220]  visits to war torn globalist torn Sharia here in a moment he was also in
[02:10:11.220 --> 02:10:14.900]  Libya during the bombardment and predicted all of what's now unfolding and
[02:10:14.900 --> 02:10:19.580]  now we've gone from them denying al-Qaeda is the main force to the CFR last week
[02:10:19.580 --> 02:10:23.980]  we read the article last on the news saying that al-Qaeda is brave and
[02:10:23.980 --> 02:10:28.660]  bringing leadership and hardness and is doing a great job blowing up churches
[02:10:28.660 --> 02:10:33.220]  and killing the alloites and the Jews and other people and our media is like
[02:10:33.220 --> 02:10:38.100]  it's wonderful we even had Dr. Steve Puchenek on who's run the overthrow of
[02:10:38.100 --> 02:10:41.660]  governments saying he thought it was wrong and then doesn't like the Russians
[02:10:41.660 --> 02:10:46.220]  and his fought against them famously but has to pretty much say they're in the
[02:10:46.220 --> 02:10:52.740]  right here but just amazing times to have a government completely insane and
[02:10:52.740 --> 02:10:59.740]  out of control so we are going to be breaking that down as well with Mr.
[02:10:59.740 --> 02:11:06.820]  Tarpley Webster breaking down the geopolitical situation right now what
[02:11:06.820 --> 02:11:10.500]  do you make of the fact that al-Qaeda is being praised as the best thing since
[02:11:10.500 --> 02:11:16.460]  last bread well it's a sign of desperation and I think the desperation
[02:11:16.460 --> 02:11:22.260]  comes from the fact that the Arab Spring is turning into the Saudi fall and by
[02:11:22.260 --> 02:11:28.900]  that I mean up to now we've had these fake color revolutions that didn't
[02:11:28.900 --> 02:11:33.420]  really accomplish anything like the Time Magazine cover was that Egypt was
[02:11:33.420 --> 02:11:38.540]  after all the revolution that wasn't very little changed in Tunisia very
[02:11:38.540 --> 02:11:44.300]  little changed in Egypt a lot changed in Libya mainly for the worst and of course
[02:11:44.300 --> 02:11:48.620]  what's going on in Syria now is the deployment of al-Qaeda as the NATO
[02:11:48.620 --> 02:11:52.820]  infantry but now something else is happening and I think this is actually
[02:11:52.820 --> 02:11:58.420]  a promising thing now springtime of nations could be at hand and what we're
[02:11:58.420 --> 02:12:04.580]  talking about here are the absolute monarchies right the feudal reactionary
[02:12:04.580 --> 02:12:09.180]  absolute monarchies of the Middle East you're talking about Saudi Arabia of
[02:12:09.180 --> 02:12:13.860]  course the big one the kingpin of the whole thing but you've got Qatar you've
[02:12:13.860 --> 02:12:19.380]  got Kuwait that American soldiers actually went and died for to reinstall
[02:12:19.380 --> 02:12:25.300]  the Emir of Kuwait you've got United Arab Emirates which is a conjury of
[02:12:25.300 --> 02:12:31.900]  these feudal monstrosities right relics of barbarism you've got Oman don't
[02:12:31.900 --> 02:12:37.180]  forget them told me caboose down there at the end at the bottom of the Gulf they
[02:12:37.180 --> 02:12:44.140]  they continue to the kingdom of Jordan right the Hashemite dynasty King Abdullah
[02:12:44.140 --> 02:12:49.900]  is very much a part of the attack on Syria and we also should remember
[02:12:49.900 --> 02:12:55.540]  Morocco is still a dynasty so you've got I guess seven or eight of these monarchies
[02:12:55.540 --> 02:13:00.620]  except that they're not just monarchies they're different than what you have in
[02:13:00.620 --> 02:13:04.820]  most other parts of the world right you look at you know the Dutch the
[02:13:04.820 --> 02:13:12.780]  Belgians Sweden Norway there are still royal houses there these are mainly
[02:13:12.780 --> 02:13:18.300]  these cases the constitutional monarchy well there was a limited power their
[02:13:18.300 --> 02:13:23.220]  vestigial well and I hope so I mean I hope they're on their way out and of
[02:13:23.220 --> 02:13:26.580]  course then you have the British the British crown of course has some pretty
[02:13:26.580 --> 02:13:31.740]  serious real powers some of it on paper some not but right now we've had the
[02:13:31.740 --> 02:13:38.220]  Saudis and Qatar astonishingly taking the lead in trying to destroy Syria and
[02:13:38.220 --> 02:13:44.660]  now it looks to me like there's a realistic idea that the thing they
[02:13:44.660 --> 02:13:49.260]  boomerang that that there's going to be blowback and the blowback may be real
[02:13:49.260 --> 02:13:55.100]  revolutions right a real revolution is when you overthrow a monarchy I think
[02:13:55.100 --> 02:13:59.420]  that's elementary there was a real revolution in Egypt when they got rid
[02:13:59.420 --> 02:14:04.100]  of King Farouk there was a real revolution in in Iran when they got rid
[02:14:04.100 --> 02:14:08.260]  of the Shah of Iran so there are some real revolutions waiting to happen and
[02:14:08.260 --> 02:14:11.900]  these are the ones you're not hearing about you're not reading about there
[02:14:11.900 --> 02:14:16.100]  have been riots going on in Bahrain continuously for a year and a half
[02:14:16.100 --> 02:14:20.780]  they've gotten more intense over the last couple of weeks and in Saudi Arabia
[02:14:20.780 --> 02:14:28.300]  you have this so-called eastern province right at Keith here you a TIF this is
[02:14:28.300 --> 02:14:33.420]  where the oil is located to a significant degree but it's also where the
[02:14:33.420 --> 02:14:39.140]  population are shiites and they don't like the sort of Wahhabite extremist
[02:14:39.140 --> 02:14:44.260]  rule of the of the House of Saud and the people have been getting killed there
[02:14:44.260 --> 02:14:49.460]  there have been big demonstrations suppressed by security forces not a
[02:14:49.460 --> 02:14:54.100]  word coming from Hillary Clinton about any of that like not a word from Obama
[02:14:54.100 --> 02:15:00.020]  or Susan Rice or from the Republicans for that matter and we've just gotten a
[02:15:00.020 --> 02:15:06.100]  an opinion from a kind of a Saudi expert who says that he thinks that we right
[02:15:06.100 --> 02:15:10.620]  now in the Middle East of course we've got the Ramadan holiday right which
[02:15:10.620 --> 02:15:15.740]  Ramadan tends to suppress certain kinds of activity because you can't eat
[02:15:15.740 --> 02:15:19.820]  anything while the Sun is out so yeah you got to eat breakfast really early and
[02:15:19.820 --> 02:15:25.100]  then fast all day and then you break your fast when it gets to be dark so it
[02:15:25.100 --> 02:15:28.620]  means that they'd be amount of energy that people have is somewhat limited
[02:15:28.620 --> 02:15:36.380]  this expert that I'm referring to when he saw the demonstrations he said look
[02:15:36.380 --> 02:15:42.300]  when the Ramadan ends and I that's in a couple of weeks then there's gonna be a
[02:15:42.300 --> 02:15:47.540]  big absurd there's gonna be a big increase in the agitation against the
[02:15:47.540 --> 02:15:50.580]  House of Saud and the other thing that he said which I think is also
[02:15:50.580 --> 02:15:56.540]  significant that the royal family of Saudi Arabia is beginning to splinter in
[02:15:56.540 --> 02:16:01.940]  other words there are factions that are emerging and if that happens that is
[02:16:01.940 --> 02:16:06.780]  of course the only way that an oligarchy like that could be disturbed in
[02:16:06.780 --> 02:16:10.940]  their power but that's it seems to be what's happening and I guess the the
[02:16:10.940 --> 02:16:15.020]  big headline in all of this is Prince Bondar right Prince Bondar that we've
[02:16:15.020 --> 02:16:20.420]  talked about in the past right the the main political operative of the House
[02:16:20.420 --> 02:16:25.820]  of Saud in our in our time is Bondar Bondar Bush he was here from I think
[02:16:25.820 --> 02:16:34.140]  1983 to 19 it's a 2005 he was operating here in Washington DC he was made the
[02:16:34.140 --> 02:16:41.220]  chief of Saudi intelligence in the same week that the Saudis were an integral
[02:16:41.220 --> 02:16:45.340]  part of that attack on Syria right the bomb in the in the government
[02:16:45.340 --> 02:16:50.220]  headquarters that killed the defense minister generals the crisis manager
[02:16:50.220 --> 02:16:55.780]  Assad's brother-in-law and so forth the Saudis obviously had a big role in that
[02:16:55.780 --> 02:17:02.420]  attack on on Syria and within four days four or five days there was a bomb at the
[02:17:02.420 --> 02:17:07.820]  Saudi intelligence headquarters which killed officially killed the number two
[02:17:07.820 --> 02:17:12.700]  guys the deputy to Prince Bondar but Prince Bondar had just been named the
[02:17:12.700 --> 02:17:17.260]  head of Saudi intelligence and there are reports coming from my friend Jerry
[02:17:17.260 --> 02:17:22.420]  Maysall not really totally confirmed but then there were some people on the
[02:17:22.420 --> 02:17:28.220]  other side who say no it's not true but Bondar also succumbed to that bombing
[02:17:28.220 --> 02:17:34.580]  attack and whether that is true or not I think you can see that right something
[02:17:34.580 --> 02:17:38.300]  big is changing sure Webster let's look at the wide hold on one second my friend
[02:17:38.300 --> 02:17:42.420]  I was about to go to break here give us a big pullback you know the big picture
[02:17:42.420 --> 02:17:48.180]  geopolitically with Iran the proxy war in Syria where is all this going on your
[02:17:48.180 --> 02:17:54.740]  radar screen well the mention mention Iran Iran is coming out more and more in
[02:17:54.740 --> 02:17:58.420]  support of Syria Russia is coming out more and more supportive Syria the
[02:17:58.420 --> 02:18:03.620]  reason for that is that July 18th bomb the big one that killed the Defense
[02:18:03.620 --> 02:18:07.740]  Minister who was hitting me the top Christian in the government he had to
[02:18:07.740 --> 02:18:14.020]  die from that time on it's more and more clear that the Syrian rebels are
[02:18:14.020 --> 02:18:18.500]  terrorists I mean a lot of us have known this for a long time but it's
[02:18:18.500 --> 02:18:23.540]  something that you can then act on the rebels have also kidnaped our media is
[02:18:23.540 --> 02:18:27.580]  now saying Al Qaeda is sexy I mean the London Guardian was like man they get it
[02:18:27.580 --> 02:18:32.020]  done and the CFR is like who I was like breathlessly talking about it like it
[02:18:32.020 --> 02:18:36.460]  was Marilyn Monroe or something double double think double think who's the
[02:18:36.460 --> 02:18:42.580]  day after that bomb went off you had a visit by the Syrian actually by the
[02:18:42.580 --> 02:18:48.140]  Iranian no sorry the Syrian went to Iran this is Mualem heavy set guy the
[02:18:48.140 --> 02:18:52.300]  foreign minister Mualem went to see his his counterpart there in Iran and that's
[02:18:52.300 --> 02:18:59.380]  Salih and Salih he said I'm warning all those Arab countries that are fanning
[02:18:59.380 --> 02:19:05.500]  the flames in Syria if you keep this up you should not imagine that you will
[02:19:05.500 --> 02:19:09.980]  remain immune to this this in it I'm basically interpreting what he said
[02:19:09.980 --> 02:19:14.820]  reading between the lines this is going to boomerang against you and this I
[02:19:14.820 --> 02:19:18.780]  think was a signal what he said is this is the beginning of World War three and
[02:19:18.780 --> 02:19:26.380]  that Iran is all in now yeah I mean I think that you know the rhetoric is
[02:19:26.380 --> 02:19:31.100]  always thick and fast in the Middle East but but I think the big thing is that
[02:19:31.100 --> 02:19:34.780]  there's a serious mobilization of networks right maybe it's Iranian
[02:19:34.780 --> 02:19:40.500]  networks maybe Russian networks maybe there are other networks all kinds of
[02:19:40.500 --> 02:19:45.980]  possibilities that somehow that's right proxy wars go two ways we'll be right
[02:19:45.980 --> 02:19:50.780]  back and talk about special ops black op attacks all over the Middle East against

[02:24:27.380 --> 02:24:32.420]  now Webster here's the deal this isn't just chatter it's admission they're
[02:24:32.420 --> 02:24:37.500]  going live with it promoting military on the streets checkpoints brigades in
[02:24:37.500 --> 02:24:42.580]  every city basically martial law all our police contacts that we've talked to
[02:24:42.580 --> 02:24:46.220]  around the country on air and off confirmed sources I have said yeah
[02:24:46.220 --> 02:24:50.340]  they're told basically something huge in October now we know just cuz they're
[02:24:50.340 --> 02:24:53.220]  telling police that doesn't mean it's gonna happen but it means that the
[02:24:53.220 --> 02:24:58.500]  safety is off they're looking at an Iran attack they think real proxy networks
[02:24:58.500 --> 02:25:04.020]  not stage false flags may hit they're gonna capitalize on that to take
[02:25:04.020 --> 02:25:07.580]  liberties they got an army report out saying the tea party is gonna link up
[02:25:07.580 --> 02:25:12.380]  with al-qaeda I mean it is just they don't care everything screwed up they
[02:25:12.380 --> 02:25:16.980]  use it as a power grab how much better would it have been with the Muhammad
[02:25:16.980 --> 02:25:23.340]  Mozadek pro-west a freedom lover secular building up Iran it would be a
[02:25:23.340 --> 02:25:27.180]  beautiful tourist destination a great place we wouldn't have all this going
[02:25:27.180 --> 02:25:31.220]  on but the British strategy of tension they've just got to wreck all these
[02:25:31.220 --> 02:25:34.980]  countries so they can be at the top of the poop pile I mean it is really a
[02:25:34.980 --> 02:25:40.740]  horrible situation why why are they gearing up for total martial law in
[02:25:40.740 --> 02:25:45.700]  the US is it the Iran option and how perilous is the world situation right
[02:25:45.700 --> 02:25:50.540]  now as countries square off well it's it's perilous because of the world
[02:25:50.540 --> 02:25:54.460]  economic and financial depression and this is the absolute bedrock of any
[02:25:54.460 --> 02:25:59.940]  analysis you've got to understand that we are in the situation between 1929 and
[02:25:59.940 --> 02:26:05.580]  1933 there's a depression any analysis that doesn't start from the depression
[02:26:05.580 --> 02:26:10.860]  the panic and then the crash and now a prolonged protracted and worsening
[02:26:10.860 --> 02:26:15.380]  depression then you'll go wrong and what you saw back in the 1930s is the three
[02:26:15.380 --> 02:26:20.820]  stage process economic depression leads to authoritarian governments and
[02:26:20.820 --> 02:26:25.500]  dictatorships and then that leads to world war now we're stuck in that the
[02:26:25.500 --> 02:26:29.660]  thing that I would strongly recommend everybody do not repeat not go chasing
[02:26:29.660 --> 02:26:35.620]  after every tentacle that the enemy does don't go you know protesting every
[02:26:35.620 --> 02:26:39.540]  everything in the world right you know with you that that amounts to
[02:26:39.540 --> 02:26:43.860]  surrendering to the will of the enemy you've got to come into this with your
[02:26:43.860 --> 02:26:50.580]  own autonomous organizing perspective mine is called the national anti-austerity
[02:26:50.580 --> 02:26:55.060]  committees the presidential election is I think largely meaningless whether it's
[02:26:55.060 --> 02:27:01.580]  Obama whether it's Romney both are bad obviously in December under the slogan
[02:27:01.580 --> 02:27:06.420]  of the fiscal cliff and the grand bargain during the lame duck session of
[02:27:06.420 --> 02:27:11.940]  Congress and a temple be made to impose genocidal austerity killer cuts on the
[02:27:11.940 --> 02:27:17.500]  American people that's where the action is the the the question is can you break
[02:27:17.500 --> 02:27:22.180]  the power of finance capital or can you not right people were chasing after
[02:27:22.180 --> 02:27:27.620]  Occupy Wall Street run by various kinds of you know anarchist fakers it's a
[02:27:27.620 --> 02:27:31.620]  failure people ran after candidates in the Republican Party that's also a
[02:27:31.620 --> 02:27:35.580]  failure now you've got to understand it's a much bigger task it's much harder
[02:27:35.580 --> 02:27:40.500]  not easy it's not prepackaged you've got to have your own economic program how
[02:27:40.500 --> 02:27:44.740]  would you take power and lead the country out of a depression and not by by
[02:27:44.740 --> 02:27:49.940]  trading about free markets not by talking about genocidal cuts not by not by
[02:27:49.940 --> 02:27:53.900]  going for the ideology of either of these two parties but an actual competent
[02:27:53.900 --> 02:27:58.380]  recovery program I have one on my site topley.net right it's a five-point
[02:27:58.380 --> 02:28:02.780]  program but we've got to somehow get them get a mass base for that and then we
[02:28:02.780 --> 02:28:08.100]  can be like France and have 75% tax rates on top I don't know that you know
[02:28:08.100 --> 02:28:12.340]  that's not the end of the world US did fine with tax rates that high let me just
[02:28:12.340 --> 02:28:15.420]  stop you for a minute because I mean I mean I get the little sideways jabs
[02:28:15.420 --> 02:28:19.900]  there here's the deal I don't want corporate welfare and I don't like them
[02:28:19.900 --> 02:28:24.460]  shutting down their competition that's that you know that's real free American
[02:28:24.460 --> 02:28:28.700]  system but all these big government systems the government set up by the
[02:28:28.700 --> 02:28:33.260]  globalist to siphon off any type of money we try to put out there to get the
[02:28:33.260 --> 02:28:38.220]  economy going I'm not even against those models but it's all so corrupt it
[02:28:38.220 --> 02:28:43.300]  seems like it's in a terminal implosion so the best way is to have more people
[02:28:43.300 --> 02:28:47.420]  with government off their back but everybody I know would expand their
[02:28:47.420 --> 02:28:51.180]  businesses if they had government off their back yeah but it's that wall
[02:28:51.180 --> 02:28:55.580]  street is on the government's back well I agree run is everything wall street
[02:28:55.580 --> 02:28:59.660]  rules the world the government the government is a bureau of wall street I
[02:28:59.660 --> 02:29:03.180]  agree all I ever hear about is more taxes on me though not on the offshore
[02:29:03.180 --> 02:29:06.900]  banks now what if you talk to me then you'd hear about wall street sales tax
[02:29:06.900 --> 02:29:11.700]  let's level one percent turnover fee transaction tax on everything over a
[02:29:11.700 --> 02:29:15.660]  million dollars so if they want to do flash trading and program trading that's
[02:29:15.660 --> 02:29:19.500]  great they're gonna pay no I agree with that to stop the fraud we absolutely
[02:29:19.500 --> 02:29:24.100]  absolutely so the point is you've got to have your own recovery program and and
[02:29:24.100 --> 02:29:27.020]  you've got a fight for it and I think this is the big thing I tell you on
[02:29:27.020 --> 02:29:31.460]  Webster let's get you on sometime next week for a full hour or a commercial
[02:29:31.460 --> 02:29:34.740]  free on the nightly nose you know during the interview commercial free we have

[02:42:44.580 --> 02:42:49.220]  Jones I'm pretty wound up on my pollen burst plus well I'll tell you what I was
[02:42:49.220 --> 02:42:54.180]  wound up about an hour ago I got a story for your new newspaper tell me I was
[02:42:54.180 --> 02:42:58.780]  calling in reference to a rifle for sale and I found and so what I did is I
[02:42:58.780 --> 02:43:03.220]  texted the guy I said you still have your rifle for sale well apparently I I
[02:43:03.220 --> 02:43:08.660]  was one digit off on the text about 10 minutes later I got a call from the
[02:43:08.660 --> 02:43:15.140]  police station wanted to know why I was texting this person about a gun and I
[02:43:15.140 --> 02:43:23.700]  said well I noticed I text the wrong number and I'm sorry and so he calls up
[02:43:23.700 --> 02:43:31.420]  and he says how did it go he said I need to know who I'm speaking with and I
[02:43:31.420 --> 02:43:36.620]  said well what's this in reference to and he said it was about you know a gun
[02:43:36.620 --> 02:43:41.780]  and everything and I said well my name's John and he wanted to know why I was
[02:43:41.780 --> 02:43:47.420]  calling this person I said well it was in reference to a gun sale and I said I
[02:43:47.420 --> 02:43:51.460]  dialed the wrong I texted the wrong number I said is that a crime in America
[02:43:51.460 --> 02:43:56.460]  to do a wrong number and he said he was following up on a report he needed my
[02:43:56.460 --> 02:44:00.260]  name and my last name and all this information I said you know what you've
[02:44:00.260 --> 02:44:04.820]  got your report it was the wrong number my name's John and he said no you're
[02:44:04.820 --> 02:44:07.860]  gonna you're gonna tell me everything and I said I'm not telling you anything I
[02:44:07.860 --> 02:44:14.220]  said that uh you got enough for enough information for your report and I said
[02:44:14.220 --> 02:44:17.620]  um I said you know I can give you the number I was gonna call so you can see
[02:44:17.620 --> 02:44:22.140]  it was one digit off and he said well go ahead and give it to me so I started to
[02:44:22.140 --> 02:44:24.820]  get it and I thought you know what that guy doesn't need to be molested by the
[02:44:24.820 --> 02:44:27.380]  police either so I said you know what I gotta change your heart I'm not gonna
[02:44:27.380 --> 02:44:31.180]  give it to you and then he started getting real I well I would have said
[02:44:31.180 --> 02:44:35.620]  hey why don't you go out to the White House shipping guns to Mexico listen
[02:44:35.620 --> 02:44:40.380]  there are resting people for lemonade stands and for their children riding on
[02:44:40.380 --> 02:44:45.340]  the sidewalk with chalk out front their house because they can't go after real
[02:44:45.340 --> 02:44:50.260]  criminals and the political police chiefs basically put him by the feds
[02:44:50.260 --> 02:44:56.500]  promote these guys if they do this I've got a report out of Texas here it's in
[02:44:56.500 --> 02:45:01.540]  my stack I meant to get to it where the neighbor gets in a fight he shoots his
[02:45:01.540 --> 02:45:06.420]  neighbors or shooting at him the police pull up the guys got him pinned down with
[02:45:06.420 --> 02:45:14.060]  his AR-15 another good neighbor shoots them with his Colt 44 and the cops put
[02:45:14.060 --> 02:45:18.900]  him in the handcuffs and say we don't know of a civilian should be able to do
[02:45:18.900 --> 02:45:23.100]  this and there was a debate in the town on whether the guy that shot the guy
[02:45:23.100 --> 02:45:28.540]  shooting at the cops should go to jail and the cop who he
[02:45:28.540 --> 02:45:32.580]  saved said well I think it's okay for civilians to do that hey cops you're a
[02:45:32.580 --> 02:45:37.140]  civilian too this isn't some war zone you've occupied we've gotten to the point
[02:45:37.140 --> 02:45:43.180]  now folks that in Texas if a guy is shooting at police and you shoot the
[02:45:43.180 --> 02:45:48.940]  guy they want to put you in jail I mean it's cuckoo land it's cuckoo land what
[02:45:48.940 --> 02:45:53.380]  this country's turned into so so I mean I would have just hung the phone up so what
[02:45:53.380 --> 02:45:57.140]  else and I said what's your name what's your number I want to talk to you but I
[02:45:57.140 --> 02:46:03.780]  mean the point is is that in a police state they're told act on a tip even if
[02:46:03.780 --> 02:46:06.820]  the carpet cleaner says hey he's got a case of guns at his house in Austin
[02:46:06.820 --> 02:46:10.980]  Texas the cops know that's not illegal they still come because it's in the
[02:46:10.980 --> 02:46:15.940]  Stasi state it's important to teach the tattletale that they've got power by being
[02:46:15.940 --> 02:46:20.940]  part of going after people so so how did this end wait I didn't get to the
[02:46:20.940 --> 02:46:24.220]  good part of the story yeah since I wasn't cooperating with him and I was
[02:46:24.220 --> 02:46:29.220]  only given him my name and what had happened he said well I told him I
[02:46:29.220 --> 02:46:32.820]  said you know what you've got my you've got my number I'm sure you can trace this
[02:46:32.820 --> 02:46:35.980]  if you want to talk to me any longer you can come over to my house and he said
[02:46:35.980 --> 02:46:39.420]  you know what he says if you don't give me any information I'm gonna get a war
[02:46:39.420 --> 02:46:43.660]  I'm gonna come and kick your door down and take your guns and I said what and
[02:46:43.660 --> 02:46:48.100]  he said yeah I'm gonna come and kick your door down and once I heard that I
[02:46:48.100 --> 02:46:53.380]  told my wife give me her phone her she's got a recorder on it so I started
[02:46:53.380 --> 02:46:57.180]  recording it and I told him want to start recording I said what did you say
[02:46:57.180 --> 02:47:00.460]  again you're gonna come over to my house and do what and I think he knew what was
[02:47:00.460 --> 02:47:06.820]  going on but he didn't say it again but um what's the department grayling
[02:47:06.820 --> 02:47:13.900]  sheriff's department in Michigan and and so long story short he ends up hanging
[02:47:13.900 --> 02:47:18.660]  up on me so I call the number back and I asked to speak with whoever just called
[02:47:18.660 --> 02:47:22.260]  me and harassed me and they wouldn't give me that they wouldn't give me anybody
[02:47:22.260 --> 02:47:25.420]  I said well I'm filing a complaint I want to file a complaint don't worry
[02:47:25.420 --> 02:47:29.180]  their globalist masters have already wrecked Michigan good now I'm gonna have
[02:47:29.180 --> 02:47:32.740]  jobs soon anyway so they've mission complete America down down for the
[02:47:32.740 --> 02:47:38.340]  count good job man go ahead what else happened I called back again and I told
[02:47:38.340 --> 02:47:42.660]  him right at the same time I told him I wanted to call back so the under sheriff
[02:47:42.660 --> 02:47:47.620]  finally called me back a half hour later and I told him this situation and he was
[02:47:47.620 --> 02:47:50.860]  trying to like entrap you into something wrong it's like hey loon I was
[02:47:50.860 --> 02:47:54.940]  calling somebody out of an ad to buy a gun you got my number I'm talking to you
[02:47:54.940 --> 02:48:00.540]  yeah and so I recorded that whole conversation and he started laughing when
[02:48:00.540 --> 02:48:04.540]  I told him what had happened and I said this funny to you and he just he's
[02:48:04.540 --> 02:48:07.900]  laughing I said you know what I'm filing a complaint with this and he says oh
[02:48:07.900 --> 02:48:11.260]  you ain't gonna do that I said yeah I said you're probably gonna hear from a
[02:48:11.260 --> 02:48:14.700]  way by the way they can't stop you from filing a criminal complaint and when
[02:48:14.700 --> 02:48:18.500]  they don't that becomes another criminal action but they count on your ignorance
[02:48:18.500 --> 02:48:23.100]  well he told me that I couldn't file I couldn't sue him because I didn't
[02:48:23.100 --> 02:48:26.860]  suffer any monetary or any physical damages and I said you know what buddy
[02:48:26.860 --> 02:48:32.660]  you know what sue him and let him beat the rap that matter they're all drinking
[02:48:32.660 --> 02:48:37.660]  fluoride water and taking cancer shots anyways hey I check your laws there but

[02:54:09.340 --> 02:54:20.620]  okay Kurt Haskell is our guest survivor of the underwear bomber he and his
[02:54:20.620 --> 02:54:26.260]  wife who saw Motalib looking at not to looking drugs from the descriptions I've
[02:54:26.260 --> 02:54:30.260]  heard like all these other pats he's being put on the airplane by the US
[02:54:30.260 --> 02:54:34.180]  government and later that came out congressional testimony Kurt what are
[02:54:34.180 --> 02:54:38.620]  you running on that's so successful and what are you gonna do when the when the
[02:54:38.620 --> 02:54:42.220]  media as you get ready to beat this guy because it's neck and neck you know
[02:54:42.220 --> 02:54:48.580]  brings up how dare you as a survivor how dare you you know be someone that
[02:54:48.580 --> 02:54:54.340]  exposed the fact that he was gotten on the plane well you know I've been on the
[02:54:54.340 --> 02:54:58.420]  show many times and we all know anyone that followed that case knows that it
[02:54:58.420 --> 02:55:01.700]  was admitted during the hearings in Congress that he was put on the plane
[02:55:01.700 --> 02:55:05.620]  intentionally so that's what I'm gonna say I mean how do you deny that there was
[02:55:05.620 --> 02:55:10.460]  video of it on YouTube you know so that's gonna be my response to that but
[02:55:10.460 --> 02:55:14.580]  what am I running on that's so successful I'm running on a three-part
[02:55:14.580 --> 02:55:22.460]  campaign I want to restore the middle class instead of this have and have not
[02:55:22.460 --> 02:55:27.900]  system that we're getting into the past few years of course I'm very big on
[02:55:27.900 --> 02:55:31.560]  constitutional rights as I'm sure you probably suspected and many of your
[02:55:31.560 --> 02:55:36.620]  listeners have and also you know I want to go get to a balanced budget and do
[02:55:36.620 --> 02:55:42.220]  something about the debt and you know go to a hard money standard or honest money
[02:55:42.220 --> 02:55:46.340]  like Ron Paul likes to call it so you know that's the three parts of my
[02:55:46.340 --> 02:55:53.820]  campaign you know my opponent Walberg is supported by the banks and Wall Street
[02:55:53.820 --> 02:56:00.660]  and all his votes go against the people therefore the banks Wall Street and
[02:56:00.660 --> 02:56:05.900]  also rich so people are getting really tired of that up here he also ran as a
[02:56:05.900 --> 02:56:10.840]  tea party candidate when he ran yet all of his votes go against the
[02:56:10.840 --> 02:56:16.580]  Constitution you know he's voted for cisp on HR 347 renewal of the Patriot Act
[02:56:16.580 --> 02:56:22.900]  NDA etc etc and of course I'm against all of those I'm very pro-constitution I
[02:56:22.900 --> 02:56:27.660]  would I would vote against all of them you know including the body-scanning
[02:56:27.660 --> 02:56:33.500]  machines of course I want to get rid of those so and of course I don't want to
[02:56:33.500 --> 02:56:37.340]  just audit the Federal Reserve Bank I want to get rid of it completely I
[02:56:37.340 --> 02:56:41.940]  think it's a complete disaster for Americans so I want to take it one
[02:56:41.940 --> 02:56:46.220]  step further than you know the recent bill that was passed so those are a few
[02:56:46.220 --> 02:56:49.940]  things I'm running on well you know I've seen your platform and I probably
[02:56:49.940 --> 02:56:54.980]  agree with about 90% of it but the issue is we know you're a guy of credibility
[02:56:54.980 --> 02:56:59.420]  who has honor and courage and will not let peer pressure get to you you know the
[02:56:59.420 --> 02:57:02.980]  first month and a half for the FBI was disagreeing with your story and then it
[02:57:02.980 --> 02:57:07.780]  all came out in Congress and in a few news articles oh the US government did
[02:57:07.780 --> 02:57:10.580]  ask the State Department to get him on the airplane and they did get him a
[02:57:10.580 --> 02:57:15.180]  visa and he didn't have a passport and Kurt Haskell was right about that and
[02:57:15.180 --> 02:57:18.420]  they don't want to release the security tapes and why was he brought around the
[02:57:18.420 --> 02:57:22.100]  body-scanners well it was the rollout of the body-scanners here set for the next
[02:57:22.100 --> 02:57:29.420]  week January 1st this was a PR rollout so they got in closing what is the
[02:57:29.420 --> 02:57:32.740]  website how do people in Michigan get behind you to make sure you get into
[02:57:32.740 --> 02:57:38.020]  Congress sure Kurt Haskell for Congress calm and of course you know guys I
[02:57:38.020 --> 02:57:43.300]  really need some donations to support my campaign I spent quite a bit of my own
[02:57:43.300 --> 02:57:48.700]  money on the primary and to beat Wahlberg I'm gonna need to raise a lot of money
[02:57:48.700 --> 02:57:54.380]  yes 600,000 in the bank I think I don't think I need to raise that much to win
[02:57:54.380 --> 02:57:57.700]  because I'm a much better better candidate but I need to raise a
[02:57:57.700 --> 02:58:03.540]  significant amount and by the way you are pro-second amendment very much the
[02:58:03.540 --> 02:58:07.300]  entire Constitution I support let's just be clear isn't that other
[02:58:07.300 --> 02:58:11.620]  Republican I'm going for memory but I mean aren't I mean didn't he quasi-anti-
[02:58:11.620 --> 02:58:15.820]  gun yeah you know just because I'm running as a Democrat doesn't mean I'm
[02:58:15.820 --> 02:58:20.340]  a liberal no I know but if the guy you're running against is a hundred
[02:58:20.340 --> 02:58:26.820]  percent guns get him on that a pro-democrat a a pro-gun Democrat will
[02:58:26.820 --> 02:58:30.860]  sink a neocon any day hey buddy great job look for to do a longer interview soon

[03:00:42.180 --> 03:00:48.140]  had two false flags here in the past two weeks Congress is out of session what
[03:00:48.140 --> 03:00:52.780]  do you think chances are that there'll be one or two more false flags and an
[03:00:52.780 --> 03:00:58.660]  executive order? An emergency declaration and an emergency order or
[03:00:58.660 --> 03:01:03.220]  executive order? You know that's why I love phone calls that's why I love phone
[03:01:03.220 --> 03:01:07.540]  calls for a week I've been meaning to say that Obama said he may sign one on
[03:01:07.540 --> 03:01:12.620]  cybersecurity that's got massive gun restrictions in it he may sign that bill
[03:01:12.620 --> 03:01:17.380]  in as executive order when you can't do that and you're absolutely right I've
[03:01:17.380 --> 03:01:20.700]  meant to make that point that if they think they can get away with it with
[03:01:20.700 --> 03:01:25.820]  enough events oh well he had to because because people were shooting up all the
[03:01:25.820 --> 03:01:31.740]  poor folks it's where we're absolutely are you worried about that? Absolutely you
[03:01:31.740 --> 03:01:37.820]  know I work here with people on about a lot of rednecks they're all saying well
[03:01:37.820 --> 03:01:43.380]  I'm buying ammo and I'm buying guns I'm getting ready and when they come to my
[03:01:43.380 --> 03:01:49.300]  house I'm like no no no I just you know you don't want to be there I says you
[03:01:49.300 --> 03:01:53.740]  won't get off two rounds if they come to your house we you know the mantra of the
[03:01:53.740 --> 03:01:59.180]  infantry is shoot move and communicate but we need to reverse that we need to
[03:01:59.180 --> 03:02:05.340]  communicate and then if that doesn't work we move and then if that doesn't
[03:02:05.340 --> 03:02:10.580]  work there's a very very last thing we get to shoot you're a genius you're
[03:02:10.580 --> 03:02:14.700]  right shoot move communicate that's basic guerrilla warfare we need to reverse
[03:02:14.700 --> 03:02:19.620]  that the info war communicate the founders did this and then try to move
[03:02:19.620 --> 03:02:24.700]  out of the way and then if you can't do it then you have to go offence via
[03:02:24.700 --> 03:02:28.820]  defense and then that's just the way it is and then you got to go all the way
[03:02:28.820 --> 03:02:35.020]  absolutely really good point and you know I communicate with everybody
[03:02:35.020 --> 03:02:39.540]  every day you know I was with you at Bilderberg I've got to order some more
[03:02:39.540 --> 03:02:44.740]  tyranny response team t-shirts because I've worn out the three I've got I wear
[03:02:44.740 --> 03:02:51.500]  them every day and I'm in New York today and you know I I have an empty
[03:02:51.500 --> 03:02:57.100]  holster on my on my belt and people ask me well what's that empty holster for
[03:02:57.100 --> 03:03:03.380]  I says well because you people in New York like unarmed victims I says where
[03:03:03.380 --> 03:03:09.420]  I'm from we get to carry guns and I open carry all the time at home I've got
[03:03:09.420 --> 03:03:13.980]  one of those little little strap what they call a yaki holster it's just the
[03:03:13.980 --> 03:03:20.180]  same width as your belt yeah the most most of the pistol and you know people
[03:03:20.180 --> 03:03:23.900]  look at me and I will know that's what scares the system is that we openly
[03:03:23.900 --> 03:03:27.900]  start exercising our rights when they want to run TV shows and ads implying
[03:03:27.900 --> 03:03:32.300]  guns are illegal in your house it's all a perception battle God bless you great
[03:03:32.300 --> 03:03:35.460]  points Chris and Rhode Island last caller we have time for sorry the others
[03:03:35.460 --> 03:03:39.940]  Chris we got about a minute and a half go ahead great show today I want to make
[03:03:39.940 --> 03:03:43.580]  a couple quick comments about Pachanik I couldn't disagree more than about he
[03:03:43.580 --> 03:03:46.500]  says the FBI does a good job with domestic terrorism that's probably
[03:03:46.500 --> 03:03:49.740]  because they run with domestic terrorists and then he couldn't have
[03:03:49.740 --> 03:03:53.980]  licked up a trace of boots anymore it you know Pachanik is the head of the
[03:03:53.980 --> 03:03:58.860]  global drugs syndicate we know as the CIA it wasn't the head of that I mean
[03:03:58.860 --> 03:04:03.340]  Pachanik's a really serious guy and obviously we get him on to try to you
[03:04:03.340 --> 03:04:06.860]  notice when I wanted to get into specifics and I'm 11 it was hot I mean
[03:04:06.860 --> 03:04:11.260]  he's the real deal I mean it's pretty amazing if you actually look into that
[03:04:11.260 --> 03:04:15.740]  guy it's pretty scary quite frankly he's listening probably right now but I mean
[03:04:15.740 --> 03:04:20.140]  sure yeah I mean he's he's I mean it's a real insider we it's a council on farm
[03:04:20.140 --> 03:04:24.820]  relations guy high level what do you think about the October surprise being a
[03:04:24.820 --> 03:04:29.900]  second Cuban missile crisis that's definitely in the cards I mean the
[03:04:29.900 --> 03:04:35.020]  October surprise is an Iran war and a bunch of stuff blowing up and I mean
[03:04:35.020 --> 03:04:39.540]  I mean look they're gearing the military up for all sorts of stuff domestically and
[03:04:39.540 --> 03:04:43.980]  and you've got this new army report where they say the Tea Party works with
[03:04:43.980 --> 03:04:47.860]  al-Qaeda I mean folks they may arrest me and say I'm al-Qaeda I mean that's how
[03:04:47.860 --> 03:04:53.980]  dumb they think you are while they run al-Qaeda in Libya and Syria and
[03:04:53.980 --> 03:05:01.500]  everywhere else it's just unbelievable all right stay with us
