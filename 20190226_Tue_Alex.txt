[00:00:07.492 --> 00:00:17.738]  I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe you got one!
[00:00:17.738 --> 00:00:23.002]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.371]  Adrenochrome.
[00:00:42.371 --> 00:00:43.412]  Adrenochrome?
[00:00:43.412 --> 00:00:45.873]  Hmm.
[00:00:45.873 --> 00:00:57.780]  Adrenochrome first hit pop culture in 1971, when gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson wrote about it in his book, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.
[00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:06.485]  He wrote that his lawyer, Oscar Acosta, was defending a Satanist who was charged with molesting a child.
[00:01:06.485 --> 00:01:09.767]  The Satanist client paid his lawyer with adrenochrome,
[00:01:11.818 --> 00:01:18.940]  And claim the only source was the adrenaline glands from a living human body.
[00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:30.364]  If you search Google for adrenochrome, the Google-supported result is from the conspiracy wiki, which suggests that it is all merely fantasy.
[00:01:30.364 --> 00:01:34.526]  But just to the right, you will find that adrenochrome is real.
[00:01:35.842 --> 00:01:44.830]  According to scientific research, adrenochrome is formed by the oxidation of its precursor, adrenaline.
[00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.815]  Adrenaline is the active hormone from the adrenal medulla, otherwise known as epinephrine.
[00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.998]  EpiPens are auto-injectors that contain synthetic adrenaline.
[00:01:58.998 --> 00:02:00.300]  Developed by the U.S.
[00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:08.090]  military to protect soldiers in the event of chemical warfare, EpiPens are used to treat extreme allergic reactions.
[00:02:10.074 --> 00:02:14.398]  EpiPens only have a shelf life of about 18 months.
[00:02:14.398 --> 00:02:27.368]  According to the manufacturer, after 18 months, the oxidation process begins and the EpiPens are turned into adrenochrome.
[00:02:27.368 --> 00:02:36.156]  Interestingly, both companies that manufacture the EpiPen, Mylon and Kaleo, are connected to the Clinton Foundation.
[00:02:40.294 --> 00:02:47.852]  Ambrosia, a controversial new startup company, was recently charging $8,000 to fill your veins with the blood of young people.
[00:02:51.384 --> 00:03:04.750]  Founder and CEO, Dr. Jesse Karmazin, who claims it will give you superhuman powers, has recently ceased patient treatments due to a recent FDA warning.
[00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:16.454]  In Greek mythology, ambrosia means immortality and was the food of the gods that gave longevity or immortality to whoever consumed it.
[00:03:16.454 --> 00:03:20.576]  It is believed by many researchers to represent the blood of the young.
[00:03:22.856 --> 00:03:31.802]  The cosmetic industry has been using aborted fetal tissues in various anti-aging skincare products.
[00:03:31.802 --> 00:03:38.807]  The taboo culture of consuming the young seems to go back through all of human history.
[00:03:38.807 --> 00:03:42.049]  But now, it seems to be coming out into the open.
[00:03:44.094 --> 00:03:47.436]  Democrats are pushing for full-term abortions.
[00:03:47.436 --> 00:03:49.497]  The infant would be delivered.
[00:03:49.497 --> 00:03:51.918]  The infant would be kept comfortable.
[00:03:51.918 --> 00:03:57.040]  The infant would be resuscitated if that's what the mother and the family desired.
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.322]  And then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mothers.
[00:04:01.322 --> 00:04:05.244]  And telling us that the future is too grim for us to think about raising a family.
[00:04:05.484 --> 00:04:10.566]  There's scientific consensus that the lives of children are going to be very difficult.
[00:04:10.566 --> 00:04:13.187]  Is it okay to still have children?
[00:04:13.187 --> 00:04:22.671]  How far is this going to go before humanity has enough?
[00:04:22.671 --> 00:04:27.993]  For NewsWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[00:04:27.993 --> 00:04:28.893]  InfoWars.com.
[00:04:28.893 --> 00:04:32.614]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:04:32.614 --> 00:04:34.075]  We're building a pro-human future.
[00:04:35.185 --> 00:04:38.106]  For the stars and beyond.
[00:04:38.106 --> 00:04:40.627]  We're building the new human millennium.
[00:04:40.627 --> 00:04:43.108]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:04:43.108 --> 00:04:45.528]  All right.
[00:04:45.528 --> 00:04:50.190]  This is going to be a magnificent transmission today.
[00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.931]  Magnificent.
[00:04:52.931 --> 00:04:54.631]  Ha ha!
[00:04:54.631 --> 00:04:56.232]  So, just get ready.
[00:04:56.232 --> 00:04:57.892]  A lot is coming up, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:57.892 --> 00:04:59.553]  But I thought we'd kick off with that report.
[00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:18.674]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[00:05:18.674 --> 00:05:28.777]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[00:05:28.777 --> 00:05:37.321]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[00:05:38.161 --> 00:05:39.502]  There's nothing else like it.
[00:05:39.502 --> 00:05:40.663]  You must experience it.
[00:05:40.663 --> 00:05:42.605]  It is a total game-changer.
[00:05:42.605 --> 00:05:47.669]  And it comes in easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:49.190]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:50.671]  It lasts 10 hours.
[00:05:50.671 --> 00:05:57.356]  So take a half-pack the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[00:05:57.356 --> 00:05:58.858]  TurboForce at m4slive.com.
[00:06:05.327 --> 00:06:09.330]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:21.557]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:21.557 --> 00:06:33.323]  I told you last week, on Friday, that the FBI wasn't just investigating Jesse Smollett for wire fraud, for his fraudulent letter.
[00:06:33.323 --> 00:06:34.404]  No, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:06:35.282 --> 00:06:40.925]  I told you that they were investigating Smollett being directed by people above him.
[00:06:40.925 --> 00:07:02.598]  And what came out in the news yesterday, that the folks heading up the show were strangely enough, not just one, not just two, but three different people on the show, claimed hate crimes happened to them or happened to their families, and then strangely enough had written screenplays or short stories previously of the exact same thing happening.
[00:07:04.554 --> 00:07:17.241]  So, later in the broadcast, I'm going to get to that, because it was in my stack yesterday, I didn't get to it, and I just remembered it, so I put that mental note, so we can re-pull it out of yesterday's stack, because that's pretty big news, and we never got to it.
[00:07:17.241 --> 00:07:26.545]  So, it's usually tomorrow's news today, and of course this news is next week's news today, but then sometimes it becomes yesterday's news, because I dropped the ball.
[00:07:26.545 --> 00:07:29.627]  See how that works?
[00:07:29.627 --> 00:07:31.088]  Amazing.
[00:07:31.088 --> 00:07:31.688]  Amazing.
[00:07:31.688 --> 00:07:33.289]  Yep, there's a last, last,
[00:07:35.256 --> 00:07:40.118]  Last week, and now Fox News and others are reporting on it.
[00:07:40.118 --> 00:07:44.379]  Okay, let me stop right there.
[00:07:44.379 --> 00:07:46.920]  I just interviewed Tommy Robinson.
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:56.804]  I don't usually tape interviews, but he had to take care of his son and one of his friends that were coming over for a little barbecue at the house.
[00:07:56.804 --> 00:08:00.245]  And so I taped the interview with him, but we're going to air it.
[00:08:01.388 --> 00:08:21.575]  In the third hour, and it is the most powerful Tommy Robinson interview ever because they got undercover video and audio over the last year of MI5, MI6, working with George Soros to frame him for sex crimes.
[00:08:21.575 --> 00:08:28.317]  Of course, he exposes the mass Muslim kidnapping rings, delivering the young girls to the British aristocracy, in some cases for murder.
[00:08:29.875 --> 00:08:32.416]  I mean, the guy's an absolute folk hero.
[00:08:32.416 --> 00:08:33.337]  In prison repeatedly.
[00:08:33.337 --> 00:08:35.478]  First guy to ever break it.
[00:08:35.478 --> 00:08:44.843]  Uh, you know, he's like 5'5", and, you know, takes on four or five guys that are 6'2", 6'1", and, you know, kicks their ass.
[00:08:44.843 --> 00:08:45.684]  He's the real deal.
[00:08:45.684 --> 00:08:47.645]  He's David versus Goliath.
[00:08:47.645 --> 00:08:52.187]  And they are going to have to destroy him.
[00:08:52.187 --> 00:08:52.968]  But here's the good news.
[00:08:55.073 --> 00:08:58.295]  They miscalculated ultra massively.
[00:08:58.295 --> 00:09:02.877]  Now he got banned from Instagram and Facebook and a bunch of other places last night for the film.
[00:09:02.877 --> 00:09:09.280]  The first salvo in two others that are about to come out that are going to premiere here.
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:19.885]  Where they're on tape saying we're going to frame him for sex crimes and saying let's stage stuff that he supposedly did to you.
[00:09:19.885 --> 00:09:21.906]  And then we're going to say that the videos from him.
[00:09:23.041 --> 00:09:40.452]  I mean, you're talking the BBC, working with Hope Not Hate, that's publicly a subsidiary of Soros, the equivalent of Media Matters here, engaged in hardcore criminal activity.
[00:09:40.452 --> 00:09:42.913]  Now, the video's been pulled off of Instagram and Facebook.
[00:09:42.913 --> 00:09:45.034]  We're at a million and a half views.
[00:09:45.034 --> 00:09:46.835]  It has 170-something thousand views on YouTube.
[00:09:46.835 --> 00:09:49.777]  It will get taken down.
[00:09:49.777 --> 00:09:50.778]  We're going to upload it.
[00:09:52.225 --> 00:09:55.666]  With the taped interview we just did.
[00:09:55.666 --> 00:10:01.888]  So the crew was asking me, right as we went live, because I ended the interview with Tommy 30 seconds before we went live.
[00:10:01.888 --> 00:10:02.948]  So they said, what's your directive?
[00:10:02.948 --> 00:10:05.069]  I said, give me a minute.
[00:10:05.069 --> 00:10:06.269]  Crew did an amazing job.
[00:10:06.269 --> 00:10:07.609]  Take the interview with Tommy.
[00:10:07.609 --> 00:10:09.850]  Let's not even wait till the third hour.
[00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:12.131]  Take the interview with Tommy.
[00:10:12.131 --> 00:10:16.212]  Clip it on the front of the film.
[00:10:20.009 --> 00:10:26.001]  The censored film, and then we'll post that to Infowars.com and Newswars.com on our own servers.
[00:10:26.001 --> 00:10:31.090]  Because that's why we built this, it's why I knew this was coming for a long time, it's why we've got a lot of tricks up our sleeves.
[00:10:34.008 --> 00:10:35.609]  Truth is our only weapon, I will tell you.
[00:10:35.609 --> 00:10:40.852]  We've got a lot of dug-in emplacements in the Infowar.
[00:10:40.852 --> 00:10:47.056]  But the enemy has turned loose intelligence agencies, which you're going to see in this film, and it's admitted.
[00:10:47.056 --> 00:10:47.957]  And it's bipartisan.
[00:10:47.957 --> 00:10:53.921]  The neocons and the Democrats are working together, and they have turned the Central Intelligence Agency loose on me.
[00:10:53.921 --> 00:10:56.362]  They have turned the FBI loose on us.
[00:10:56.362 --> 00:11:02.046]  And I'm just a loyal, hard-working American at my post, fighting.
[00:11:03.387 --> 00:11:05.268]  But I cannot stress to you how epic this is.
[00:11:05.268 --> 00:11:06.950]  Now, here's the goodness.
[00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:17.037]  The average real person in the CIA that actually goes after bad guys and fights real evil people, because it has that arm, is a total listener and loves us.
[00:11:17.037 --> 00:11:18.998]  The average FBI agent absolutely loves us.
[00:11:18.998 --> 00:11:23.001]  I don't want to get into details, but it's ridiculous.
[00:11:23.001 --> 00:11:23.222]  Okay?
[00:11:24.116 --> 00:11:28.679]  I mean, I run into federal marshals, FBI, customs people.
[00:11:28.679 --> 00:11:31.761]  They're just opening doors for me, and that tears in their eyes.
[00:11:31.761 --> 00:11:35.123]  Border Patrol, these are good, hard-working people, very race, color, and creed.
[00:11:35.123 --> 00:11:36.383]  They know what's going on.
[00:11:36.383 --> 00:11:40.586]  But they know the higher-ups are a bunch of damn crooks, and they know Trump's trying to turn this around.
[00:11:40.586 --> 00:11:49.151]  But let me tell you, for at least 25 years, they have been on purpose putting people like Reality Winner.
[00:11:49.972 --> 00:11:53.173]  All this crazy SJW stuff you see suddenly everywhere on the streets.
[00:11:53.173 --> 00:11:58.294]  It's been breeding and preparing and gearing up like Mordor's army.
[00:11:58.294 --> 00:12:01.234]  Like the Nazi army in 1939.
[00:12:01.234 --> 00:12:08.456]  It has just spilled out like a cell busting open and releasing millions of viruses.
[00:12:08.456 --> 00:12:10.636]  That's this offensive you're seeing.
[00:12:10.636 --> 00:12:14.177]  And Trump and nationalism around the world is the counter offenses.
[00:12:14.177 --> 00:12:15.297]  But it's desperate.
[00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:17.642]  Reality winner.
[00:12:17.642 --> 00:12:18.863]  Change her name to reality winner.
[00:12:18.863 --> 00:12:22.267]  She was blonde haired, blue eyed girl who said whites should be exterminated.
[00:12:22.267 --> 00:12:23.769]  She tried to join ISIS.
[00:12:23.769 --> 00:12:26.412]  She had a top security clearance at the FBI.
[00:12:26.412 --> 00:12:33.541]  And she was leaking all the info to ISIS and the leftist groups.
[00:12:33.541 --> 00:12:35.223]  These are mental patients.
[00:12:36.587 --> 00:12:42.189]  And I'd say a good 30% of the government is now hardcore reality winners.
[00:12:42.189 --> 00:12:49.912]  Like this guy they just busted that gave Avenatti the illegal IRS files on Cohen.
[00:12:49.912 --> 00:12:53.453]  And he's a hardcore Bernie Sanders supporter.
[00:12:53.453 --> 00:12:56.354]  And believes that whites are evil even though he's white.
[00:12:56.354 --> 00:12:58.215]  These are mental patients.
[00:12:58.215 --> 00:13:02.117]  These are Stockholm Syndrome people under the globalist control.
[00:13:02.117 --> 00:13:02.937]  These are followers
[00:13:05.148 --> 00:13:14.037]  We've taken down to a level of brainwashed slaves.
[00:13:14.037 --> 00:13:16.900]  So, this is the threshold we stand at.
[00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:19.023]  So, I think we can beat Riali Warner.
[00:13:19.023 --> 00:13:21.105]  I think we can beat Hillary Clinton.
[00:13:21.105 --> 00:13:22.186]  We've got to be willing to die.
[00:13:22.952 --> 00:13:29.914]  You gotta be willing for Hillary Clinton to send a hit team in to put a fast-acting heart attack agent on your toothbrush.
[00:13:29.914 --> 00:13:32.075]  It's sadly the most common way of doing it.
[00:13:32.075 --> 00:13:33.815]  Or you have a kayaking accident.
[00:13:33.815 --> 00:13:34.296]  You know what?
[00:13:34.296 --> 00:13:35.356]  I'm not worried about that.
[00:13:35.356 --> 00:13:35.836]  I don't want to die.
[00:13:35.836 --> 00:13:37.196]  I'll never commit suicide.
[00:13:37.196 --> 00:13:40.918]  But I'm worried about the devil worship, the pedophilia, the evil.
[00:13:40.918 --> 00:13:45.299]  And so as a man, I am honored to be targeted.
[00:13:45.299 --> 00:13:46.339]  But here's the thing.
[00:13:46.339 --> 00:13:51.341]  I want to fight with every ounce of my energy and every ounce of my
[00:13:53.769 --> 00:13:59.932]  Focused love for the innocents.
[00:13:59.932 --> 00:14:05.235]  Because I tend to get into hatred of the globalists and that is a dark force in the end and only brings us down.
[00:14:05.235 --> 00:14:06.956]  We need to do it for the children.
[00:14:06.956 --> 00:14:08.037]  We need to do it for the innocents.
[00:14:08.037 --> 00:14:09.137]  We need to do it for the truth.
[00:14:09.137 --> 00:14:13.259]  We need to do it because that is what God wants us to do.
[00:14:13.259 --> 00:14:14.120]  We have to be the souls of the earth.
[00:14:15.478 --> 00:14:18.600]  And so Mankal Muller is going to be popping in on the show.
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:22.063]  And in the fourth hour, we're going to air his podcast in its entirety.
[00:14:22.063 --> 00:14:23.024]  His first podcast.
[00:14:23.024 --> 00:14:24.285]  He's been retired for a year.
[00:14:24.285 --> 00:14:25.546]  Came back out of retirement.
[00:14:25.546 --> 00:14:26.406]  Big syndicate of talk shows.
[00:14:26.406 --> 00:14:28.748]  Good friend of mine.
[00:14:28.748 --> 00:14:30.749]  But he said it moved his whole crew to tears.
[00:14:30.749 --> 00:14:32.311]  I've known Mankal 15, 16 years.
[00:14:32.311 --> 00:14:34.432]  He's never talked like this.
[00:14:34.432 --> 00:14:42.198]  He said that everybody that's listening to the podcast was totally and completely blown away by it.
[00:14:46.628 --> 00:14:54.034]  And we're going to be airing it coming up in the fourth hour.
[00:14:54.034 --> 00:14:55.356]  And I was just standing there in the kitchen.
[00:14:55.356 --> 00:14:56.637]  It was supposed to be a 10-minute interview.
[00:14:56.637 --> 00:15:02.241]  I ended up doing an hour on his radio show and not working out that morning.
[00:15:02.241 --> 00:15:05.224]  And then I did 45 minutes of his podcast after that.
[00:15:05.224 --> 00:15:08.727]  I ended up barely making it to work that day, but I thought it was important to do.
[00:15:08.727 --> 00:15:11.649]  And we really get into what's at the bottom of the rabbit hole.
[00:15:11.649 --> 00:15:13.130]  So you want hardcore
[00:15:13.991 --> 00:15:27.221]  What's at the bottom of the rabbit hole that had, by the end of it, because it doesn't start that powerful, by the end of the uninterrupted 40-something minutes, it shakes everyone that hears it, and everyone knows it's true.
[00:15:27.221 --> 00:15:31.124]  And it's pure Veritas.
[00:15:31.124 --> 00:15:33.165]  So that's going to be in the fourth hour.
[00:15:33.165 --> 00:15:36.768]  Tommy Robinson, and we've blown them wide open, and their whole criminal operation.
[00:15:38.998 --> 00:15:43.060]  Also, we've got so many other big guests.
[00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:46.602]  Caitlin Bennett's knocked out of the park yet again.
[00:15:46.602 --> 00:15:47.823]  Robert Barnes.
[00:15:47.823 --> 00:15:49.284]  So much today.

[00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:34.953]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[00:17:34.953 --> 00:17:37.994]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[00:17:37.994 --> 00:17:43.916]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[00:17:43.916 --> 00:17:47.698]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[00:17:47.698 --> 00:17:48.978]  Was there ever a vote?
[00:17:48.978 --> 00:17:50.319]  Who do we fight for?
[00:17:50.319 --> 00:17:56.501]  The deep state began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[00:17:56.501 --> 00:17:57.942]  Available at Amazon Books.

[00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:21.026]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:21.026 --> 00:20:25.887]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:20:25.887 --> 00:20:27.388]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:39.796 --> 00:20:48.902]  Panodrama is the film seen over a million and a half times since it went up yesterday on Instagram and Facebook.
[00:20:48.902 --> 00:20:52.424]  It's BBC quality video.
[00:20:52.424 --> 00:21:01.049]  It's a documentary showing the BBC trying to frame Tommy Robinson for criminal actions.
[00:21:01.049 --> 00:21:06.493]  And saying they're planning on framing him so he can be sent to prison.
[00:21:09.318 --> 00:21:14.640]  That's who these people are.
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:17.661]  They have no bottom.
[00:21:17.661 --> 00:21:20.742]  They'll do anything.
[00:21:20.742 --> 00:21:22.883]  Remember?
[00:21:22.883 --> 00:21:32.146]  Out of the five women that accused Kavanaugh, all of them except one have admitted it was fake.
[00:21:32.146 --> 00:21:33.346]  And one has been indicted.
[00:21:33.346 --> 00:21:36.367]  We ought to check and see where that's gone.
[00:21:36.367 --> 00:21:37.948]  And she said, well, he's a bad guy.
[00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:47.373]  And I wanted to support Balazi Ford, who was the most disingenuous lying witch I've ever seen in my life.
[00:21:47.373 --> 00:21:55.716]  I mean, I wouldn't believe her if she said the sky was blue.
[00:21:55.716 --> 00:21:56.896]  None of her stories checked out.
[00:21:56.896 --> 00:21:58.177]  It was all lies.
[00:21:58.177 --> 00:22:04.779]  But when you experience people, whole cloth lying,
[00:22:06.263 --> 00:22:07.023]  It's incredible.
[00:22:07.023 --> 00:22:10.084]  You know, they say I hold cloth light.
[00:22:10.084 --> 00:22:13.665]  No, sometimes I get things wrong.
[00:22:13.665 --> 00:22:16.646]  And when I get them wrong, I tell you because I want to have credibility.
[00:22:16.646 --> 00:22:20.368]  I want to be right.
[00:22:20.368 --> 00:22:22.908]  And especially as I get older, I used to have a photographic memory.
[00:22:22.908 --> 00:22:24.549]  It's still decent, but I conflate things.
[00:22:24.549 --> 00:22:25.429]  I mix things.
[00:22:25.429 --> 00:22:26.370]  I'm always like, pull this up.
[00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:27.310]  Let me check that.
[00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:28.530]  Because, you know, I know it.
[00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:29.391]  It's a couple of years old.
[00:22:29.391 --> 00:22:30.211]  Sometimes I can kind of
[00:22:31.249 --> 00:22:35.030]  Attribute something to somebody else when it was somebody else because they look the same or their names similar.
[00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:38.652]  You know how that works, but I'm trying to tell you the truth with everything I got!
[00:22:38.652 --> 00:22:45.594]  And that's why they're always trying to undermine me.
[00:22:45.594 --> 00:22:48.816]  And say Jones doesn't really mean it.
[00:22:48.816 --> 00:22:51.217]  Jones does it for the money.
[00:22:51.217 --> 00:22:54.058]  The money?
[00:22:54.058 --> 00:22:55.298]  Back when I was making $300,000 a year.
[00:22:55.298 --> 00:22:55.398]  Gross.
[00:22:59.403 --> 00:23:17.248]  And living in a very blue-collar house, I was putting 95% of the money back into InfoWars, and I was offered millions a year, the contract, the book deals, the TV shows, everything.
[00:23:17.248 --> 00:23:21.670]  By the time I was bringing in a couple million a year gross and building the operation, they didn't know.
[00:23:22.657 --> 00:23:25.739]  They offered me $10,000,000.
[00:23:25.739 --> 00:23:29.701]  That's not $10,000,000 worth of supplements you sell.
[00:23:29.701 --> 00:23:35.425]  So it's really $5,000,000 and then you have to fund all the operations, the advertising, the staff, the band with the crew.
[00:23:35.425 --> 00:23:41.528]  And so you've got $1,000,000 and you put that back in to build the operation.
[00:23:41.528 --> 00:23:42.689]  No, no, that's $10,000,000.
[00:23:42.689 --> 00:23:49.453]  And you move to New York or you move to LA and you get the trophy wife.
[00:23:52.779 --> 00:23:54.440]  And you're part of the power structure.
[00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:56.201]  No, thank you.
[00:23:56.201 --> 00:24:00.583]  I mean, it's not like it's even tempting to be sold out.
[00:24:00.583 --> 00:24:13.808]  The soullessness, the emptiness at those tables with those executives and their trophy wives, who on three separate occasions tried to have sex with me.
[00:24:13.808 --> 00:24:14.689]  Hey, you like my wife?
[00:24:21.616 --> 00:24:24.418]  Oh, that's another story I forgot.
[00:24:24.418 --> 00:24:27.300]  I didn't just have Hollywood producers three times grab my testicles.
[00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:28.041]  And see, I'm not a victim.
[00:24:28.041 --> 00:24:31.143]  I thought it was weird and two of the times threatened to kick their ass.
[00:24:31.143 --> 00:24:33.185]  The other time I was so shocked because I admired the person.
[00:24:33.185 --> 00:24:35.407]  I was like, what the hell is your problem?
[00:24:35.407 --> 00:24:45.394]  And he was dying of cancer at the time, so I didn't make a big deal out of it.
[00:24:45.394 --> 00:24:49.377]  It's all about power with these people, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:49.377 --> 00:24:50.238]  It's all about power.
[00:24:52.335 --> 00:24:54.436]  And I was married, too.
[00:24:54.436 --> 00:24:56.357]  I mean, the woman was good-looking.
[00:24:56.357 --> 00:24:57.498]  Women were really hot.
[00:24:57.498 --> 00:24:59.519]  I mean, if I wasn't married, I probably would have jumped on it.
[00:24:59.519 --> 00:25:01.119]  But I wasn't going to sit there.
[00:25:01.119 --> 00:25:01.840]  Yeah, I'm worldly.
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:02.280]  I'll admit it.
[00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:03.040]  I'm of the flesh.
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:03.441]  I like women.
[00:25:03.441 --> 00:25:07.042]  Kind of like Cavanaugh said, I like beer.
[00:25:07.042 --> 00:25:08.943]  Well, I like women.
[00:25:08.943 --> 00:25:11.165]  God, I appreciate God making them.
[00:25:11.165 --> 00:25:12.485]  Anyways, side issue.
[00:25:12.485 --> 00:25:16.067]  What I'm getting at here is that I'm not a fake.
[00:25:16.067 --> 00:25:17.288]  I don't want to be around fakes.
[00:25:17.288 --> 00:25:19.469]  And those people are total mummies.
[00:25:21.633 --> 00:25:23.254]  They're mommies!
[00:25:23.254 --> 00:25:24.014]  They're not happy.
[00:25:24.014 --> 00:25:29.897]  There's an emptiness around them.
[00:25:29.897 --> 00:25:42.142]  But if you're in the middle of nowhere in Oklahoma, and you walk into some little gas station to buy some minnows, because you're going to go fishing in a local lake, and there's an old black lady behind the counter,
[00:25:43.323 --> 00:25:52.296]  And her daughter's over there making hamburgers with daddy who's whistling and happy and they're whistling gospel tunes.
[00:25:52.296 --> 00:25:58.405]  Those people, you can feel the energy, you can feel the soul, you can feel the goodness, the completion, the happiness.
[00:26:00.407 --> 00:26:05.910]  And it feels like you're at home, just like if it's white family behind the counter Christians.
[00:26:05.910 --> 00:26:06.991]  It's the same people.
[00:26:06.991 --> 00:26:10.033]  Their skin color's different, but they've got God.
[00:26:10.033 --> 00:26:12.654]  They don't need all the money, the power, any of it.
[00:26:12.654 --> 00:26:23.240]  They're happy where they are at their little church and their little life, and they can walk by the graveyard and say, great granddaddy's right over there.
[00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:25.762]  They've got their souls.
[00:26:25.762 --> 00:26:27.383]  I want to be with them.
[00:26:29.463 --> 00:26:33.326]  And that's why the globalists hate flyover country.
[00:26:33.326 --> 00:26:36.207]  That's why they try to infect it with meth and all the drugs.
[00:26:36.207 --> 00:26:41.671]  That's why they, because they can't stand the fact that you're out there breathing clean air.
[00:26:41.671 --> 00:26:45.994]  They can't stand the fact that you're out there fishing in the creek.
[00:26:45.994 --> 00:26:50.116]  They can't stand the fact that you're satisfied driving your old truck.
[00:26:50.116 --> 00:26:53.278]  You're happy with that garden in the backyard.
[00:26:53.278 --> 00:26:56.000]  And beans cooking on the stove.
[00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:02.881]  With confident, strong people.
[00:27:02.881 --> 00:27:06.602]  When you look them in the eye, it's got the sparkle.
[00:27:06.602 --> 00:27:11.724]  See, I'm looking for the sparkle in my life.
[00:27:11.724 --> 00:27:14.124]  I remember, you can see it in photographs, you can see it everywhere.
[00:27:14.124 --> 00:27:15.985]  Everybody marvels about when you think about it.
[00:27:15.985 --> 00:27:21.306]  Look at old photos, or think about when you were a kid, what your grandmother's eyes looked like.
[00:27:21.306 --> 00:27:24.027]  How they twinkled.
[00:27:24.027 --> 00:27:25.868]  You don't see a lot of the twinkle anymore, do you?
[00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:31.486]  I go to universities in the leftist areas, I see dead eyes.
[00:27:31.486 --> 00:27:32.948]  Zombies.
[00:27:32.948 --> 00:27:34.269]  It's more than the drugs.
[00:27:34.269 --> 00:27:38.094]  It's more than the G5 and G2 and G3 and G4.
[00:27:38.094 --> 00:27:38.875]  It's more than that.
[00:27:38.875 --> 00:27:39.777]  It's more than the GMO.
[00:27:42.785 --> 00:27:44.906]  They are dead inside.
[00:27:44.906 --> 00:27:54.731]  They have given themselves over to evil, and they don't even know who they are, but they've all got that dead, satisfied smile on their face.
[00:27:54.731 --> 00:27:58.213]  In a false identity, they believe they've taken on, so they're good.
[00:27:58.213 --> 00:28:02.075]  They're cool.
[00:28:02.075 --> 00:28:06.617]  They're not running the show.
[00:28:06.617 --> 00:28:07.438]  They've been tricked.
[00:28:08.766 --> 00:28:15.370]  There's another energy there suppressing the lightning rod to God that we are.
[00:28:15.370 --> 00:28:23.054]  And then you can see God blasting out of the soul through the electric eyes.
[00:28:23.054 --> 00:28:29.838]  I remember when I was a kid looking at my dad's eyes.
[00:28:29.838 --> 00:28:32.900]  And my dad can just smile and his eyes just go...
[00:28:37.603 --> 00:28:39.985]  And you don't see that anymore, do you?
[00:28:39.985 --> 00:28:42.487]  Twinkle in the eye.
[00:28:42.487 --> 00:28:44.368]  The twinkle in the eye is the sign of the soul.
[00:28:44.368 --> 00:28:48.811]  It's the light from within shining out.
[00:28:48.811 --> 00:28:53.455]  And you look into the eyes of AOC and Hillary.
[00:28:53.455 --> 00:28:55.636]  They're shark eyes.
[00:28:55.636 --> 00:28:57.618]  There's nothing there but death.
[00:28:59.346 --> 00:29:04.332]  Number one international best-selling author, Matthew David Hurtado's pain was simple.
[00:29:04.332 --> 00:29:12.542]  Lyme disease bankrupt him in 2009, watching bankers take everything from his family after building a seven-figure business from his couch.
[00:29:12.542 --> 00:29:18.489]  God called him to ministry to teach prosperity based on pain he could not tolerate in others' lives.
[00:29:18.889 --> 00:29:21.531]  IRS, creditors, car loans, debt.
[00:29:21.531 --> 00:29:26.335]  It's the Babylonian system and you have to escape it before it's too late.
[00:29:26.335 --> 00:29:29.377]  Haven't you ever wanted to wake up from this nightmare?

[00:30:09.707 --> 00:30:18.711]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[00:30:18.711 --> 00:30:28.796]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[00:30:28.796 --> 00:30:37.321]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[00:30:38.141 --> 00:30:39.503]  There's nothing else like it.
[00:30:39.503 --> 00:30:40.664]  You must experience it.
[00:30:40.664 --> 00:30:42.746]  It is a total game-changer.
[00:30:42.746 --> 00:30:47.671]  It comes in easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[00:30:47.671 --> 00:30:49.173]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[00:30:49.173 --> 00:30:50.654]  It lasts 10 hours.
[00:30:50.654 --> 00:30:57.361]  So take a half packet the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[00:30:57.361 --> 00:30:58.842]  TurboForce at M4sLife.com.
[00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:02.591]  If you're not expanding, you're imploding.
[00:31:02.591 --> 00:31:04.332]  There is no set stasis.
[00:31:04.332 --> 00:31:05.573]  There is no managed system.
[00:31:05.573 --> 00:31:07.234]  There is no un-continuum.
[00:31:07.234 --> 00:31:10.456]  The continuum is always launching forward into the future.
[00:31:10.456 --> 00:31:13.818]  So you support us and get creative and get fired up.
[00:31:13.818 --> 00:31:15.059]  We won't just be here a hundred years.
[00:31:15.059 --> 00:31:15.859]  We'll be here forever.
[00:31:15.859 --> 00:31:17.100]  We'll turn the whole thing around.
[00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:23.984]  Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases and God knows what are going to look back and say, you know, we struggled here.
[00:31:23.984 --> 00:31:24.544]  We made it.
[00:31:24.544 --> 00:31:26.726]  And that's really where this goes.
[00:31:26.726 --> 00:31:28.527]  God's got a big war for you ready.
[00:31:28.527 --> 00:31:28.907]  And so,
[00:31:29.107 --> 00:31:35.574]  If you can't face George Soros and Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler and Mao Zedong, are you going to really be able to face the other stuff?
[00:31:35.574 --> 00:31:40.619]  Because God wants warriors that are smart and are ready to build things and are also ready to fight.
[00:31:40.619 --> 00:31:43.482]  You don't go to the next level without getting a big weight put on your back.
[00:31:43.482 --> 00:31:45.884]  And I mean, I don't know what's going to happen to me in the future.
[00:31:45.884 --> 00:31:49.388]  I mean, all I know is I want to go with the master built.
[00:31:49.388 --> 00:31:50.409]  I want to go to the next level.
[00:31:50.669 --> 00:31:54.931]  I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced, not these devil worshippers.
[00:31:54.931 --> 00:31:57.833]  They're cold and failed and feels like being in a tomb.
[00:31:57.833 --> 00:31:58.893]  I want life!
[00:31:58.893 --> 00:32:00.214]  I want Jesus!
[00:32:00.214 --> 00:32:04.176]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[00:32:04.176 --> 00:32:07.457]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[00:32:07.457 --> 00:32:13.720]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:16.502]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[00:32:17.222 --> 00:32:21.047]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[00:32:21.047 --> 00:32:27.516]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[00:32:27.516 --> 00:32:32.502]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[00:32:33.226 --> 00:32:37.148]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[00:32:37.148 --> 00:32:44.352]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[00:32:44.352 --> 00:32:49.595]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[00:32:49.595 --> 00:32:55.278]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[00:32:55.278 --> 00:32:59.240]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:07.021]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:07.021 --> 00:33:16.344]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:43.829 --> 00:34:00.154]  Well, in a whole bunch of European countries and now in Austria has joined them saying that the refugee arrival centers are now departure centers and they're going to be kicked out.
[00:34:00.154 --> 00:34:01.295]  What have I told you?
[00:34:35.859 --> 00:34:46.584]  Yeah, Mancow's phone was busy, but then I texted him, he said, no, I'm sitting around here, so I'm just getting the guest on.
[00:34:46.584 --> 00:34:55.268]  Because he has his offices for a syndicated radio show and TV program right above where Smollett staged all this.
[00:34:55.268 --> 00:34:59.690]  Coming at you live!
[00:34:59.690 --> 00:35:03.332]  Klaus has got some good music.
[00:35:03.332 --> 00:35:04.192]  Live.
[00:35:04.192 --> 00:35:05.093]  Teleprompter free, baby.
[00:35:07.947 --> 00:35:10.588]  Okay, we're going to go to Mancow as soon as we get him on.
[00:35:10.588 --> 00:35:16.790]  There's a bunch of other news, obviously I haven't gotten to yet, a bunch of incredible clips that we're going to play.
[00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:23.893]  But the first thing I need to do here is mid-air refueling.
[00:35:23.893 --> 00:35:25.594]  Mid-air refueling.
[00:35:25.594 --> 00:35:35.898]  This is an American populist, capitalist, pro-Christian, pro-Second Amendment, pro-human broadcast that is under globalist
[00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:55.770]  Technocracy declared war, and we have had vicious victories because of you relaunching Americana and capitalism, not just here, but what I developed over 12 years ago, the plan, 1776 worldwide.
[00:35:55.770 --> 00:36:03.595]  And in documentaries that were seen hundreds of millions of times together, and on this broadcast, and in billions of views online, I challenged the government
[00:36:04.588 --> 00:36:15.313]  That if you're not criminals, like everybody says you are, then you should be able to stop globalism, because it's evil, it's unelected, it's tyrannical, it's fraudulent, it should be easy to beat it.
[00:36:15.313 --> 00:36:15.953]  And guess what?
[00:36:15.953 --> 00:36:20.535]  All over the world, it's being beaten everywhere.
[00:36:20.535 --> 00:36:26.077]  But ladies and gentlemen, it's going to take lots of money.
[00:36:26.077 --> 00:36:32.800]  BuzzFeed makes 300 plus million dollars a year, and has to be subsidized with over
[00:36:35.345 --> 00:36:42.168]  A hundred million dollars a year and at our peak we reached probably ten times what BuzzFeed did.
[00:36:42.168 --> 00:36:46.149]  Now we reach about twice what BuzzFeed did.
[00:36:46.149 --> 00:36:48.870]  Four hundred million plus dollars.
[00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:54.452]  It cost thirty million dollars a year to run InfoWars.
[00:36:54.452 --> 00:36:57.794]  Just the bandwidth is in the millions and millions and millions.
[00:36:57.794 --> 00:37:03.176]  So that means I've got to shell a lot of product because we don't market up that much.
[00:37:06.016 --> 00:37:08.699]  I need everybody, and I'm thanking you, but it's the best toothpaste.
[00:37:08.699 --> 00:37:18.668]  It's fluoride-free, colloidal silver, iodine-fortified, developed by my dad, a retired oral surgeon and dentist, made by one of the top companies in the nation.
[00:37:18.668 --> 00:37:19.508]  It's concentrated.
[00:37:19.508 --> 00:37:20.650]  It doesn't have fillers.
[00:37:20.650 --> 00:37:28.337]  Just get your Super Blue toothpaste and immune gargle and mouthwash at Infowars4.com and fund the pro-human agenda.
[00:37:29.181 --> 00:37:30.142]  Get coffee.
[00:37:30.142 --> 00:37:32.544]  People get it and they go, my god, it's some of the best coffee I've ever had.
[00:37:32.544 --> 00:37:33.806]  And it's less than Whole Foods.
[00:37:33.806 --> 00:37:34.887]  Similar stuff.
[00:37:34.887 --> 00:37:39.391]  It's high mountain, wild-picked, really good coffee.
[00:37:39.391 --> 00:37:40.152]  It's my favorite coffee.
[00:37:41.791 --> 00:37:46.936]  It was brought in by a fella in Texas, and I used to drink it at H-E-B, and I thought it was my favorite.
[00:37:46.936 --> 00:37:49.097]  And it's also strong.
[00:37:49.097 --> 00:38:01.287]  And I got a distributorship through them, but then Obama got in, and they didn't want to do business with me anymore, so I just went right to the actual farmers through another company in Colorado that brings it in.
[00:38:01.287 --> 00:38:02.809]  And it's even a little bit better.
[00:38:02.809 --> 00:38:06.532]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods nationwide now, started off in Texas.
[00:38:08.351 --> 00:38:11.294]  For, on average, about $8 more a pound than we sell it.
[00:38:11.294 --> 00:38:15.339]  98% satisfaction, 795 reviews on Power Reviews.
[00:38:15.339 --> 00:38:15.819]  4.9 stars.
[00:38:15.819 --> 00:38:16.300]  Is that 4.8?
[00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:17.941]  I can't see, my eyes aren't as good anymore.
[00:38:26.693 --> 00:38:29.256]  So, just get the coffee with us.
[00:38:29.256 --> 00:38:30.197]  Sign up for AutoShip.
[00:38:30.197 --> 00:38:31.318]  An additional 10% off.
[00:38:31.318 --> 00:38:32.639]  And don't worry about it.
[00:38:32.639 --> 00:38:34.301]  Cancel any time for nothing.
[00:38:34.301 --> 00:38:35.362]  Cancel the AutoShip.
[00:38:35.362 --> 00:38:38.125]  But sign up every two weeks, every month, every two months, every three months.
[00:38:38.125 --> 00:38:39.326]  However you pick the coffee.
[00:38:39.326 --> 00:38:41.128]  I mean, I would just sign up for AutoShip every month.
[00:38:41.128 --> 00:38:42.049]  Get the toothpaste every month.
[00:38:42.049 --> 00:38:44.031]  Get the coffee every month.
[00:38:44.031 --> 00:38:45.613]  Get the fish oil you need.
[00:38:45.613 --> 00:38:46.474]  It's there.
[00:38:46.474 --> 00:38:47.575]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:54.824]  We have the Strength and Recovery Combo Alpha Power that is incredible for stamina, libido, energy, and body.
[00:38:54.824 --> 00:38:57.845]  It's the strongest tumor formula out there.
[00:38:57.845 --> 00:39:00.367]  95% is humanoid.
[00:39:00.367 --> 00:39:01.928]  Average decile of Whole Foods is 3-5%.
[00:39:01.928 --> 00:39:04.630]  I went out and said, I don't care.
[00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:07.592]  They go, top brands put $2 a product in it.
[00:39:07.592 --> 00:39:09.373]  I go, I don't care.
[00:39:09.373 --> 00:39:11.935]  I want $10 a product in it.
[00:39:13.928 --> 00:39:19.411]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:39:19.411 --> 00:39:21.092]  People buy supplements because they work.
[00:39:21.092 --> 00:39:22.793]  I mean, what do you think coffee is?
[00:39:22.793 --> 00:39:25.094]  They're trying to say that's a supplement now so they can ban it.
[00:39:25.094 --> 00:39:26.155]  It's plants.
[00:39:26.155 --> 00:39:27.115]  It's things in the earth.
[00:39:27.115 --> 00:39:29.356]  They work.
[00:39:29.356 --> 00:39:31.357]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:39:31.357 --> 00:39:31.757]  Just commit.
[00:39:34.810 --> 00:39:36.471]  Like a tie to the truth.
[00:39:36.471 --> 00:39:39.672]  A tie to stopping the Globalists and Soros and Hillary and the scumbags.
[00:39:39.672 --> 00:39:46.335]  And putting it in their eye, not bowing down to them, to just go sign up for auto-ship and know you're funding this and you've got my commitment.
[00:39:46.335 --> 00:39:51.778]  I will fight till all the gas is out and all the blood's run out of my veins.
[00:39:51.778 --> 00:39:55.739]  I will stumble forward, biting the enemy as I go down.
[00:39:55.739 --> 00:39:58.140]  You have total commitment to me.
[00:39:58.140 --> 00:40:02.723]  Absolute, complete, total commitment.
[00:40:02.723 --> 00:40:03.523]  But I need that from you.
[00:40:05.882 --> 00:40:08.415]  It's unbelievable what we've already done together.
[00:40:08.415 --> 00:40:09.259]  All right, let's go to...
[00:40:10.168 --> 00:40:12.990]  Mancow, mancowpodcast.com.
[00:40:12.990 --> 00:40:14.752]  Mancow took off a year.
[00:40:14.752 --> 00:40:18.815]  Of course, big syndicated TV radio host, Fox host, you name it.
[00:40:18.815 --> 00:40:19.836]  And he's a good friend of mine.
[00:40:19.836 --> 00:40:20.736]  Got to know him over the years.
[00:40:20.736 --> 00:40:26.321]  And we have some of the same views and understandings about the real cosmology of the universe and the rabbit hole.
[00:40:26.321 --> 00:40:29.543]  And I'm going to air almost all of his first new podcast.
[00:40:29.543 --> 00:40:33.426]  It's already rising up the charts on iTunes in the fourth hour today.
[00:40:33.426 --> 00:40:35.127]  Because he said it was powerful.
[00:40:35.127 --> 00:40:36.268]  His crew thought it was powerful.
[00:40:36.268 --> 00:40:37.770]  So we're going to air it here.
[00:40:38.570 --> 00:40:41.012]  That's what we're getting into right now in this segment and the next.
[00:40:41.012 --> 00:40:44.134]  Mancow, you are an expert on Smollett.
[00:40:44.134 --> 00:40:50.359]  You've lived in Chicago most of your life, and now I got words they're investigating people above him, putting him up to it.
[00:40:50.359 --> 00:40:51.880]  Now that's starting to come out in the news.
[00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:53.602]  Your offices are right above where this happened.
[00:40:53.602 --> 00:40:55.343]  Thanks for joining us.
[00:40:55.343 --> 00:40:56.324]  Hey, man.
[00:40:56.324 --> 00:41:02.649]  Yeah, and listen, this podcast, not to sell it, I know you're going to play a chunk of it, but what I heard from everybody is, wow, this is
[00:41:03.783 --> 00:41:21.723]  Alex Jones that I've never heard and it's the Alex Jones that I know and look I hate the obviously when we're on the radio it's an amped up version of us you know I don't tell my kids double time and and you don't sell vitamins to your kids or whatever but but you know it's it is us but it's an amped up version but I think this is a
[00:41:22.982 --> 00:41:29.989]  It was good to show people the Alex that I know, which is a godly guy that's made some mistakes, but learns from his mistakes and moves on.
[00:41:29.989 --> 00:41:34.614]  I also heard you talk about how you're going to fight to your last breath, and I believe that's true, man.
[00:41:34.614 --> 00:41:37.437]  You're a daring individual.
[00:41:38.146 --> 00:41:39.327]  You really are.
[00:41:39.327 --> 00:41:41.910]  History is going to write books about you.
[00:41:41.910 --> 00:41:52.061]  Okay, so where I broadcast in Chicago, if I look out my window, basically I look down upon where Jussie Smollett supposedly got attacked.
[00:41:52.061 --> 00:41:59.749]  The funny thing is that nobody's mentioned, and I was the first guy to question it, and of course the minute you do that, well, you know, there's so many protected
[00:42:01.219 --> 00:42:09.611]  By the way, I was on hold the day after it happened with you and heard you saying, this is a bunch of crap, I bet it's a fake hate crime.
[00:42:09.611 --> 00:42:13.958]  You ought to pull that audio and send it to me because it is big that you question it the day after.
[00:42:15.134 --> 00:42:15.975]  Well, no, no.
[00:42:15.975 --> 00:42:21.762]  I mean, yeah, I was the first guy to say, I was the really first guy to say it because I was, I happened to be the first guy on the radio.
[00:42:21.762 --> 00:42:24.225]  I mean, I was the first guy to be able to say it live, live radio.
[00:42:24.225 --> 00:42:29.971]  I mean, that's one of the beauties of radio and doing it live, not pre-recorded like a lot of these other guys.
[00:42:29.971 --> 00:42:34.797]  But, you know, one of the things that nobody mentioned is, you know, he wanted this to be filmed.
[00:42:35.772 --> 00:42:42.656]  And the moron did it in the one spot in Chicago where the cameras weren't working or were pointed the other way.
[00:42:42.656 --> 00:42:44.016]  I mean, that's what people don't realize.
[00:42:44.016 --> 00:42:46.018]  He wanted to be filmed.
[00:42:46.018 --> 00:42:48.419]  Otherwise, he would have just said that it happened.
[00:42:48.419 --> 00:42:48.819]  Hold on.
[00:42:48.819 --> 00:42:49.239]  Stay there.
[00:42:49.239 --> 00:42:52.241]  The Inside Scoop on Smollett with Man Cow.
[00:42:52.241 --> 00:42:53.301]  Stay with us.
[00:42:53.301 --> 00:42:54.362]  Infowars.com.
[00:42:54.362 --> 00:42:55.563]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:42:55.563 --> 00:42:56.043]  Stay with us.
[00:42:59.192 --> 00:43:04.636]  You know, the worst part about getting old and I'm still strong at 45 is that I won't be there for my children someday.
[00:43:04.636 --> 00:43:06.417]  That's why I need to make them strong now.
[00:43:06.417 --> 00:43:08.178]  Now, I can be there for my children.
[00:43:08.178 --> 00:43:10.019]  Now, I can make them strong.
[00:43:10.019 --> 00:43:11.660]  Now, I can instruct them.
[00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:14.362]  Now, I can teach them what I've learned, but not once I'm gone.
[00:43:14.482 --> 00:43:19.606]  You think in this digital age, your word's going forever, but now they're even better at getting rid of what you said they were before.
[00:43:19.606 --> 00:43:25.209]  It's so much easier to burn video or text or languages now that we have high-tech book burning, isn't it?
[00:43:25.209 --> 00:43:28.852]  But I have joined my will to the resistance.
[00:43:28.852 --> 00:43:33.815]  I can't be destroyed now, as long as I realize I've done right and as long as the people know the truth.
[00:43:33.815 --> 00:43:40.620]  And you can't be destroyed either, as long as you bind yourself to something and commit to it and go through the fire for it.
[00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:44.482]  There is a magic that then takes place that transcends space and time.
[00:43:44.482 --> 00:43:52.087]  When you commit via word of mouth, or to pray for us, or to spread our articles and videos, that overrides everything the enemy's doing.
[00:43:52.087 --> 00:43:58.691]  So please now, commit to support InfoWars however you can, and realize your provision to InfoWars is your own provision.
[00:43:59.699 --> 00:44:04.541]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.

[00:44:14.006 --> 00:44:18.788]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.

[00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:26.326]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:47:26.326 --> 00:47:28.028]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:47:28.028 --> 00:47:29.690]  Well, so does he.
[00:47:29.690 --> 00:47:35.957]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:35.957 --> 00:47:39.681]  Eric Moeller, the man cow, has relaunched his syndicated program.
[00:47:40.851 --> 00:47:45.434]  TheManCowbPodcast.com is a separate thing he's doing and you can find that.
[00:47:45.434 --> 00:47:46.835]  I was honored to be his first podcast.
[00:47:46.835 --> 00:47:50.938]  We're going to play most of it in the fourth hour, but you can go subscribe there.
[00:47:50.938 --> 00:47:56.322]  Going back to Man Cowb, I mean this Smollett thing I think is a tipping point.
[00:47:56.322 --> 00:47:59.585]  The Covington kids was, Balazi, Ford, all this is hurting them.
[00:48:00.225 --> 00:48:03.706]  And they're only getting more nasty, more out of control, admitting their real ideology.
[00:48:03.706 --> 00:48:05.027]  We need to get rid of kids.
[00:48:05.027 --> 00:48:05.987]  There's too many people.
[00:48:05.987 --> 00:48:08.688]  You can't have hamburgers.
[00:48:08.688 --> 00:48:10.449]  The family's bad.
[00:48:10.449 --> 00:48:12.410]  All of this stuff is getting more and more insane.
[00:48:12.410 --> 00:48:14.271]  We're going to force inoculations on you.
[00:48:14.271 --> 00:48:15.531]  World government's good.
[00:48:15.531 --> 00:48:17.852]  We're not going to punish Catholic priests that rape kids.
[00:48:17.852 --> 00:48:19.773]  We're going to sexualize your kids.
[00:48:19.773 --> 00:48:23.354]  All of this stuff is out in the open now, and then Smollett gets caught.
[00:48:23.354 --> 00:48:24.375]  You're the expert.
[00:48:24.375 --> 00:48:25.735]  You're the Chicagoite.
[00:48:25.735 --> 00:48:26.716]  You were the first to report it.
[00:48:26.716 --> 00:48:29.897]  Tell us what you questioned, where you think this is going.
[00:48:31.531 --> 00:48:34.495]  Alex, you know, you talked about the Pope and the kids.
[00:48:34.495 --> 00:48:35.596]  I mean, it is a panic.
[00:48:35.596 --> 00:48:36.597]  I think people need to know that.
[00:48:36.597 --> 00:48:38.279]  It is a worldwide thing.
[00:48:38.279 --> 00:48:40.802]  You've really been the tip of the spear on this.
[00:48:40.802 --> 00:48:45.648]  And look, there's so much of what you just said, we could spend hours, you and I, talking about it.
[00:48:45.648 --> 00:48:49.091]  Look, I'm here in the city.
[00:48:49.091 --> 00:48:50.053]  I talked to all these people.
[00:48:50.053 --> 00:48:51.134]  I talked to the police chief.
[00:48:51.713 --> 00:48:52.714]  He's a very good guy.
[00:48:52.714 --> 00:48:55.938]  Everyone's saying the same thing.
[00:48:55.938 --> 00:48:59.642]  And that is, hey, you know, come on, let's love each other.
[00:48:59.642 --> 00:49:06.149]  But imagine if this was a Trump guy, a Trump supporter that had been attacked.
[00:49:06.149 --> 00:49:09.192]  And you know who this guy was committing a crime against?
[00:49:09.192 --> 00:49:09.373]  Me!
[00:49:10.214 --> 00:49:11.714]  I mean, he did it on the street where I walk.
[00:49:11.714 --> 00:49:13.375]  He did it on the street where I go.
[00:49:13.375 --> 00:49:14.775]  He did it where I work.
[00:49:14.775 --> 00:49:20.376]  He was basically... This guy's Twitter feed, if you haven't seen it, was filled with absolute hatred.
[00:49:20.376 --> 00:49:22.637]  Oh, he wanted a better job.
[00:49:22.637 --> 00:49:30.258]  I really hate that they kept saying that, or he wanted to get paid, or he wanted to extend his time on the Empire TV show, a set that I've been on numerous times.
[00:49:30.258 --> 00:49:31.298]  This was a hate crime.
[00:49:31.298 --> 00:49:32.939]  Staging a hate crime is a hate crime.
[00:49:32.939 --> 00:49:34.319]  First of all, I think we should just have crime.
[00:49:35.097 --> 00:49:39.942]  I don't think your skin color or whatever, I don't think there should be special crime.
[00:49:39.942 --> 00:49:46.108]  But he was doing it to invoke racial conflict to be projected onto Trump supporters who frame us.
[00:49:47.216 --> 00:49:49.399]  Yeah, and you know, I had Diamond and Silk on today.
[00:49:49.399 --> 00:49:50.981]  I mean, come on.
[00:49:50.981 --> 00:49:55.726]  This president, did you see all the pictures of Spike Lee hanging out with Trump?
[00:49:55.726 --> 00:49:57.168]  Russell Simmons is friendly with me.
[00:49:57.168 --> 00:49:58.229]  I love Russell Simmons.
[00:49:58.229 --> 00:50:00.512]  He's Donald Trump's best friend.
[00:50:00.512 --> 00:50:06.279]  Jesse Jackson, the Chicago guy, has been on our show many times and, you know, loves Donald Trump.
[00:50:06.799 --> 00:50:11.201]  And of course, but it doesn't play to their race-baiting fantasy.
[00:50:11.201 --> 00:50:14.322]  There's big money in black and white people hating each other.
[00:50:14.322 --> 00:50:16.683]  And Alex, it's what you and I talk about all the time.
[00:50:16.683 --> 00:50:18.424]  Man, you know, they're saying, yeah, let's love each other.
[00:50:18.424 --> 00:50:19.064]  Absolutely.
[00:50:19.064 --> 00:50:21.105]  And I see it here in Chicago.
[00:50:21.105 --> 00:50:22.886]  The African-Americans are moving out.
[00:50:22.886 --> 00:50:24.786]  The divide is on purpose.
[00:50:24.786 --> 00:50:25.207]  All of us.
[00:50:25.207 --> 00:50:26.547]  Keep us stupid with our TV.
[00:50:26.547 --> 00:50:28.548]  Keep us stupid with our schools.
[00:50:29.088 --> 00:50:32.589]  Keep us stupid with our media and keep us fighting.
[00:50:32.589 --> 00:50:35.349]  And when we wake up and realize that we're all in this together.
[00:50:35.349 --> 00:50:39.050]  So this guy was an absolute racist, hated white people.
[00:50:39.050 --> 00:50:40.931]  His Twitter feed was filled with hatred.
[00:50:40.931 --> 00:50:42.751]  He faked this out of hatred.
[00:50:42.751 --> 00:50:48.192]  And you know, God forbid it wasn't some kind of race war that started in my city.
[00:50:48.192 --> 00:50:48.872]  You're right.
[00:50:48.872 --> 00:50:51.653]  I'm just listening to you because you're on fire.
[00:50:53.098 --> 00:51:06.481]  I was told by law enforcement last week that they're looking at people hired up in the cast, putting them up to it, and then sure enough, Fox News, Chicago Police say they have more evidence Jesse Smollett staged hate crime, and they're looking at other accomplices.
[00:51:07.574 --> 00:51:24.427]  Jesse Smollett may have gotten a hoax attack plot from Empire Creator's Instagram where he posted the very scenario months before and then other members of the show and the producers, the people in charge, have been caught staging events on themselves before.
[00:51:24.427 --> 00:51:26.329]  So this is a whole cottage industry there.
[00:51:27.661 --> 00:51:31.343]  Look, Jussie was caught another time and gave a fake name.
[00:51:31.343 --> 00:51:33.604]  He's already lied, I believe.
[00:51:33.604 --> 00:51:36.064]  There was a Twitter feed where he may have taken this story.
[00:51:36.064 --> 00:51:40.266]  I don't think it was Empire-related, but maybe community-related.
[00:51:40.266 --> 00:51:42.747]  This is a show, look, this is big business to Chicago.
[00:51:42.747 --> 00:51:44.828]  You know, I want Empire to be here.
[00:51:44.828 --> 00:51:46.008]  It's not a show that I watch.
[00:51:46.008 --> 00:51:50.850]  But yeah, this thing was circling the drain, so they needed some attention.
[00:51:50.850 --> 00:51:54.692]  And you wouldn't dare cancel a show where there was, you know, this poor young actor,
[00:51:57.413 --> 00:52:02.576]  You know, African-American homosexual actor was beaten so viciously with guys wearing Trump hats.
[00:52:02.576 --> 00:52:07.098]  I mean, I think... The show already made hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:52:07.098 --> 00:52:08.198]  It's had a long run.
[00:52:08.198 --> 00:52:09.739]  Fox bet everything on it.
[00:52:09.739 --> 00:52:11.400]  Now it's starting to lose ratings.
[00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:16.162]  This could have been worth hundreds of millions of dollars if it was pulled off right.
[00:52:16.162 --> 00:52:17.243]  That's right.
[00:52:17.243 --> 00:52:23.966]  And the head of the studio here at Cinespace, one of the head guys, told me, you know, Alex, you don't know the hell they went through because they thought it was anthrax.
[00:52:24.745 --> 00:52:35.635]  And, you know, any show on Chicago that you see, any show you see with the word Chicago, and these are big shows, Chicago Fire, Chicago PD, whatever those shows are, they're all shot in the same spot.
[00:52:35.635 --> 00:52:37.897]  Empire, but also a bunch of movies.
[00:52:37.897 --> 00:52:40.839]  I think Dark Mirror is shot here, some Netflix shows.
[00:52:40.839 --> 00:52:45.423]  So, you know, it's the second biggest studio on earth, I believe, is now in Chicago.
[00:52:45.423 --> 00:52:51.929]  So Cinespace had to be shut down because this jackhole decided to crush up an aspirin and let people believe it was anthrax.
[00:52:52.589 --> 00:52:57.937]  So, I mean, there was, you know, hundreds of thousands of dollars cost to the studios, the man hours.
[00:52:57.937 --> 00:53:01.241]  By the way, let me just give a little credit to the cops here.
[00:53:01.241 --> 00:53:02.303]  They're in one cop.
[00:53:03.024 --> 00:53:05.845]  There isn't one cop that thought that this was a real deal.
[00:53:05.845 --> 00:53:07.345]  But, you know, they did pursue it.
[00:53:07.345 --> 00:53:08.826]  They had to investigate it.
[00:53:08.826 --> 00:53:11.687]  But murders go unsolved here, and they're wasting all this time.
[00:53:11.687 --> 00:53:15.208]  Well, that's really the big crime, is they put 12 people on it.
[00:53:15.208 --> 00:53:17.129]  The media was demanding they find out who did it.
[00:53:17.129 --> 00:53:17.929]  And obviously, they get there.
[00:53:17.929 --> 00:53:20.070]  He's got fake scratches on his face.
[00:53:20.070 --> 00:53:22.491]  He's got the noose around his neck 40 minutes later.
[00:53:22.491 --> 00:53:23.511]  This is ridiculous!
[00:53:25.037 --> 00:53:26.058]  Listen, buddy.
[00:53:26.058 --> 00:53:27.339]  I know about you.
[00:53:27.339 --> 00:53:29.681]  You like to kick ass and take names.
[00:53:29.681 --> 00:53:32.483]  I'm a man, and this has nothing to do with him being homosexual.
[00:53:32.483 --> 00:53:33.123]  I don't care, man.
[00:53:33.123 --> 00:53:34.724]  I'm a libertarian like you are.
[00:53:34.724 --> 00:53:35.685]  I'm a freedom guy.
[00:53:35.685 --> 00:53:36.586]  I don't care.
[00:53:36.586 --> 00:53:37.847]  I did a hundred shows.
[00:53:37.847 --> 00:53:39.368]  I was on Broadway.
[00:53:39.368 --> 00:53:40.489]  I don't care that he's gay.
[00:53:40.489 --> 00:53:41.830]  That's not the point I'm making.
[00:53:41.830 --> 00:53:47.254]  What I want to say is there isn't a man, straight or gay, that's been in a fight that said he was in a tussle.
[00:53:47.874 --> 00:53:52.939]  I'm telling you, if you're a lower whack and they're pouring bleach in your eyes and put a noose around your neck, you don't say it's impossible.
[00:53:52.939 --> 00:53:57.723]  Look, even an average wimpy guy, you're trying to put a noose around their neck, they start kicking your ass.
[00:53:57.723 --> 00:53:59.184]  You start trying to kill people.
[00:53:59.184 --> 00:54:03.908]  I mean, you pull a noose out on me or anybody else, you're gonna get killed.
[00:54:03.908 --> 00:54:05.249]  He kept it on.
[00:54:05.249 --> 00:54:10.314]  They also found the magazines from these geniuses, the gang that couldn't shoot straight.
[00:54:10.314 --> 00:54:14.017]  They found the magazines, the cops are telling me, with the letters cut out.
[00:54:14.017 --> 00:54:15.218]  They found the bottle of bleach.
[00:54:15.859 --> 00:54:16.620]  They have video.
[00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:18.402]  I've seen the video from the Crafty Beaver store.
[00:54:18.402 --> 00:54:20.864]  This is where I go to get my building supplies.
[00:54:20.864 --> 00:54:22.646]  And, uh, you know, it's right near me.
[00:54:22.646 --> 00:54:26.931]  Anyway, you see the two guys going in there to buy all the stuff?
[00:54:26.931 --> 00:54:29.213]  Uh, this is, this thing is something else.
[00:54:29.213 --> 00:54:36.682]  Well, I mean, if you even look at the walk of the supposed guys on what did get caught on tape, it kind of looks like a kind of gangsterish swagger.
[00:54:37.642 --> 00:54:45.388]  But just imagine being in the middle of the freezing cold, middle of the night, and you're just hiding on an empty street for a guy to come out of the subway and scream, this is MAGA country.
[00:54:45.388 --> 00:54:47.789]  This is preposterous!
[00:54:47.789 --> 00:54:51.072]  And how many of the hundreds of hate crimes have turned out to be fake?
[00:54:51.072 --> 00:54:53.814]  Almost all of them are fake.
[00:54:53.814 --> 00:55:00.138]  Yeah, I mean, how many Islamic crimes, you know, crimes against Islam have been proven to be fake?
[00:55:00.138 --> 00:55:01.979]  You know, yeah, yeah.
[00:55:01.979 --> 00:55:05.662]  But, you know, look, these things do happen, and so now when it happens, we're going to
[00:55:06.454 --> 00:55:08.435]  You know, we're going to question it more.
[00:55:08.435 --> 00:55:10.537]  This is a bad thing that this guy did.
[00:55:10.537 --> 00:55:12.798]  What do you think, Alex?
[00:55:12.798 --> 00:55:14.800]  I mean, Don Lemon's saying we should forgive him.
[00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:18.062]  Of course, Don Lemon on CNN, the worst.
[00:55:18.062 --> 00:55:19.303]  What do you think is going to happen?
[00:55:19.303 --> 00:55:20.744]  Oh, Don Lemon, as you know, went further.
[00:55:20.744 --> 00:55:22.525]  I've already played the clip like five times, so I won't play it.
[00:55:22.525 --> 00:55:25.667]  He said, oh, Smollett just got bad advice.
[00:55:25.667 --> 00:55:26.528]  This was handled wrong.
[00:55:26.528 --> 00:55:29.450]  He's basically saying he just should have done a better job staging it.
[00:55:30.441 --> 00:55:31.721]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:55:31.721 --> 00:55:35.622]  So, do you think Mullet will ever serve a mullet?
[00:55:35.622 --> 00:55:37.343]  Jesse Smollett from Full House.
[00:55:37.343 --> 00:55:38.243]  Sorry.
[00:55:38.243 --> 00:55:39.063]  Jesse Smollett.
[00:55:39.063 --> 00:55:42.104]  Do you ever think that he'll spend a day in jail?
[00:55:42.104 --> 00:55:51.846]  No, I think it's going to end up being just like Brian Williams, who I watched covering Jesse Smollett and still defending it when he's the guy that claimed he was shot down in a helicopter.
[00:55:51.846 --> 00:55:54.387]  I mean, these people just think we have no memory.
[00:55:55.629 --> 00:55:57.910]  Well, you know, yes, they're liars.
[00:55:57.910 --> 00:56:01.031]  So here you have it.
[00:56:01.031 --> 00:56:01.171]  Yeah.
[00:56:01.171 --> 00:56:06.012]  I think the guys, the two Nigerian brothers that helped, I think they're going to be fine.
[00:56:06.012 --> 00:56:07.492]  I think they'll go after Smollett.
[00:56:07.492 --> 00:56:11.793]  I wonder why they haven't gone after him for faking anthrax being said.
[00:56:11.793 --> 00:56:14.034]  That's, you know, that's using the mail system.
[00:56:14.034 --> 00:56:15.334]  That's a federal offense.
[00:56:15.334 --> 00:56:16.575]  He lied to the FBI.
[00:56:16.575 --> 00:56:18.595]  Why haven't charges been filed there?
[00:56:18.595 --> 00:56:24.197]  In the meantime, this is a bit of a local thing, but Kim Fox, you know, our head prosecutor here,
[00:56:24.957 --> 00:56:27.819]  Uh, when R. Kelly is using little girls' toilets.
[00:56:27.819 --> 00:56:33.063]  And while this is happening, Alex, can you guess where Kim Foxx was, our head attorney here?
[00:56:33.063 --> 00:56:34.364]  Where?
[00:56:34.364 --> 00:56:35.865]  Do you know where she was?
[00:56:35.865 --> 00:56:36.986]  No.
[00:56:36.986 --> 00:56:39.468]  She was at the Oscars hanging out with Beyonce.
[00:56:39.468 --> 00:56:39.988]  Oh, that's right.
[00:56:39.988 --> 00:56:43.711]  I thought she might have been with the Black Congressional Caucus.
[00:56:43.711 --> 00:56:50.696]  $6,000-a-night hotel rooms, $60,000-plus-a-piece flying down to South America for a Beyonce concert.
[00:56:51.594 --> 00:56:55.017]  Uh, well, you know, she is a talented, that Beyonce's talented.
[00:56:55.017 --> 00:57:00.060]  Uh, so yeah, so our, you know, our top prosecutor here is in Hollywood while all this is going down.
[00:57:00.060 --> 00:57:01.642]  We got a heck of a city here, man.
[00:57:01.642 --> 00:57:05.164]  The violence, the taxes, and we got a mayoral election.
[00:57:05.164 --> 00:57:07.346]  You know, I'm glad though that you brought up R. Kelly.
[00:57:07.546 --> 00:57:08.387]  Do five more minutes.
[00:57:08.387 --> 00:57:10.549]  We'll have a two-minute break, come back, and then I've got my next guest.
[00:57:10.549 --> 00:57:15.453]  But me and Kyle Muller's here, and we'll also briefly talk about why people are saying this podcast is so powerful.
[00:57:15.453 --> 00:57:20.236]  Because you never come on, because I invited you on, and want to say something's really powerful.
[00:57:20.236 --> 00:57:21.738]  So you're not hyping it.
[00:57:21.738 --> 00:57:24.540]  People really liked this interview, and your staff told me that.
[00:57:24.540 --> 00:57:27.843]  And people said they were shaken by the end of it.
[00:57:27.843 --> 00:57:29.604]  So that's going to be coming up in the fourth hour.
[00:57:29.604 --> 00:57:30.545]  Thanks for letting me air that.
[00:57:30.545 --> 00:57:31.205]  But I want to ask you.
[00:57:32.226 --> 00:57:38.473]  How this guy, R. Kelly, was able to use young 13, 14-year-old girls as toilets.
[00:57:38.473 --> 00:57:44.660]  And how is a black guy pissing in the face of 13-year-old girls not a racial deal right there as well?
[00:57:44.660 --> 00:57:45.981]  But I guess they deserve it.
[00:57:45.981 --> 00:57:48.144]  They're 13, they're white, and that's what he likes to do.
[00:57:58.709 --> 00:58:07.714]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[00:58:07.714 --> 00:58:17.800]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[00:58:17.800 --> 00:58:26.325]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[00:58:27.165 --> 00:58:28.505]  There's nothing else like it.
[00:58:28.505 --> 00:58:29.666]  You must experience it.
[00:58:29.666 --> 00:58:31.646]  It is a total game-changer.
[00:58:31.646 --> 00:58:36.668]  And it comes in easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[00:58:36.668 --> 00:58:38.188]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[00:58:38.188 --> 00:58:39.669]  It lasts up to 10 hours.
[00:58:39.669 --> 00:58:46.350]  So take a half packet the first time you take it, because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[00:58:46.350 --> 00:58:50.792]  TurboForce at m4slive.com.
[00:58:50.792 --> 00:58:53.892]  Our grandparents, the great-grandparents, they canned food.
[00:58:53.892 --> 00:58:55.413]  During the falls, they'd have it during the winter.
[00:58:56.790 --> 00:58:59.735]  And that's what I'm talking about at InfoWarsTour.com.

[00:59:53.386 --> 00:59:56.028]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:04.839 --> 01:00:05.660]  Answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:00:05.660 --> 01:00:07.803]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:30.230 --> 01:00:34.337]  We've only got five minutes left with ManCal and our next guest is going to be joining us.
[01:00:34.337 --> 01:00:36.801]  This is going to be, again, a very powerful broadcast the next three hours.
[01:00:36.801 --> 01:00:38.363]  We're now into hour two.
[01:00:38.363 --> 01:00:41.508]  ManCal, we're going to hit R. Kelly, we're going to hit the Oscars.
[01:00:41.508 --> 01:00:42.750]  You want to also get into...
[01:00:45.589 --> 01:00:47.610]  AOC and her thing about not having kids.
[01:00:47.610 --> 01:00:51.312]  So give us your view on... And you were correcting me off there.
[01:00:51.312 --> 01:00:53.993]  I read somewhere white girls, black girls, whatever.
[01:00:53.993 --> 01:00:58.255]  But yeah, he likes 13-year-old girls with braces, and he likes to urinate on them.
[01:00:58.255 --> 01:00:59.496]  Now Trump's been blamed with this.
[01:00:59.496 --> 01:01:00.536]  They admit that's fake now.
[01:01:00.536 --> 01:01:01.677]  That's not true.
[01:01:01.677 --> 01:01:03.617]  Trump's a germaphobe, by the way.
[01:01:03.617 --> 01:01:04.978]  He's the opposite of that.
[01:01:04.978 --> 01:01:06.739]  But how has this guy gotten away with this this long?
[01:01:08.075 --> 01:01:11.237]  Uh, because he's a star and he's part of the system.
[01:01:11.237 --> 01:01:13.558]  Look, I've seen him in church a couple of times where I go to church.
[01:01:13.558 --> 01:01:15.639]  I saw him in the guy Steve Muncy's church.
[01:01:15.639 --> 01:01:17.000]  He's a talented guy.
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.461]  I know that's been lost, and I don't really care.
[01:01:19.461 --> 01:01:20.682]  Look, I believe in the death penalty.
[01:01:20.682 --> 01:01:22.182]  That's Mankal's law.
[01:01:22.182 --> 01:01:24.243]  I believe in the death penalty for pedophiles.
[01:01:24.243 --> 01:01:26.585]  I've got two 13-year-old daughters.
[01:01:26.585 --> 01:01:27.765]  Uh, but the guy's a celebrity.
[01:01:27.765 --> 01:01:31.427]  He's been a—what he does is he, you know, they do the rope-a-dope.
[01:01:31.427 --> 01:01:33.928]  They keep everybody busy for five or six years.
[01:01:33.928 --> 01:01:36.910]  These girls look older in court, and then he moves on.
[01:01:40.384 --> 01:01:43.807]  But he got away with it because he was, what, a Chicago insider?
[01:01:43.807 --> 01:01:45.168]  Well, and he had money, man.
[01:01:45.168 --> 01:01:46.690]  He had money.
[01:01:46.690 --> 01:01:48.952]  He picks up these poor girls that come from nothing.
[01:01:48.952 --> 01:01:50.233]  They don't have any money.
[01:01:50.233 --> 01:01:52.895]  And he's got a ton of cash to throw around, or at least he did.
[01:01:52.895 --> 01:01:54.997]  And he walks free.
[01:01:54.997 --> 01:01:56.939]  And he's using these kids as toilets.
[01:01:56.939 --> 01:01:58.240]  He's a real vile human being.
[01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:03.025]  Oh, by the way, you should get his manager on, who I had on, who said he's demonically possessed.
[01:02:03.685 --> 01:02:04.825]  Uh, and the guy's real serious.
[01:02:04.825 --> 01:02:09.167]  Look, as you've said before, this pedophilia, this is not a sexual thing.
[01:02:09.167 --> 01:02:11.908]  If a priest could have sex, he would have sex with women.
[01:02:11.908 --> 01:02:13.628]  Then we say, oh, a priest could have sex, they wouldn't want to.
[01:02:13.628 --> 01:02:16.749]  It's about defiling children and sucking their energy.
[01:02:16.749 --> 01:02:21.991]  So these girls think it's great, all of a sudden they're there, he's drugging them, he's pissing on them.
[01:02:21.991 --> 01:02:25.972]  No, no, look, he's degrading women and crushing their soul, these little girls.
[01:02:25.972 --> 01:02:27.012]  Nobody's talking about it.
[01:02:27.012 --> 01:02:28.393]  The manager said it.
[01:02:28.393 --> 01:02:30.173]  He is demonically possessed.
[01:02:30.173 --> 01:02:32.914]  He heard, he heard R. Kelly speak in a demon's voice.
[01:02:33.752 --> 01:02:44.836]  And this is not a sexual thing, this is a satanic thing, and yeah, brother, you really, people need to understand, even the Pope, I mean, the Pope agrees with you, Alex.
[01:02:44.836 --> 01:02:54.160]  That's right, the Pope has now said that the rape of children is, like human sacrifice, is demonic, but then he separately lets the archdiocese cover up the rapes.
[01:02:55.492 --> 01:02:57.995]  I mean, you know, the fact that this is still being debated.
[01:02:57.995 --> 01:02:59.716]  I mean, we've heard this our whole life.
[01:02:59.716 --> 01:03:01.018]  What are they waiting for?
[01:03:01.018 --> 01:03:02.479]  It's 2019.
[01:03:02.479 --> 01:03:04.181]  I don't care if you're a priest or not.
[01:03:04.181 --> 01:03:06.683]  We need to start executing pedophiles.
[01:03:06.683 --> 01:03:08.365]  That's, come on!
[01:03:08.365 --> 01:03:10.127]  These guys, or at least castrate them.
[01:03:12.745 --> 01:03:15.166]  And that's the religion of Hollywood and all of this.
[01:03:15.166 --> 01:03:16.446]  I've talked to high-level folks in Hollywood.
[01:03:16.446 --> 01:03:19.006]  They said, listen, pedophilia is rampant.
[01:03:19.006 --> 01:03:20.607]  And it's all about screwing kids up.
[01:03:20.607 --> 01:03:22.527]  It's all about hurting them.
[01:03:22.527 --> 01:03:24.028]  I mean, you think peeing on them.
[01:03:24.028 --> 01:03:26.268]  That's something I guess he was taught by some other devil worshiper.
[01:03:26.268 --> 01:03:28.689]  They like to make little kids eat feces.
[01:03:28.689 --> 01:03:31.529]  They like to put them in cages till they're begging for money.
[01:03:31.529 --> 01:03:34.510]  And in three or four days, they crap and make them eat feces.
[01:03:37.330 --> 01:03:39.172]  These demons wanted to base children
[01:04:02.805 --> 01:04:05.867]  With their purity and their potential for the whole universe.
[01:04:05.867 --> 01:04:07.667]  They want to ruin their lives.
[01:04:07.667 --> 01:04:09.989]  They want to screw them up.
[01:04:09.989 --> 01:04:12.510]  That's their most cherished thing.
[01:04:12.510 --> 01:04:14.451]  And I'm sorry to talk like this.
[01:04:14.451 --> 01:04:19.814]  I found a video, in fact, I think it was producers, of me 10 years ago saying devil worshippers drink children's blood.
[01:04:19.814 --> 01:04:21.354]  They call it ambrosia.
[01:04:21.354 --> 01:04:23.035]  Now that's in the text.
[01:04:23.035 --> 01:04:27.658]  Now the company that gets children's blood for rich people is called Ambrosia, man cow.
[01:04:27.658 --> 01:04:28.198]  I'm right again.
[01:04:28.951 --> 01:04:29.591]  Wow.
[01:04:29.591 --> 01:04:30.132]  Wow.
[01:04:30.132 --> 01:04:34.935]  Uh, you know, the whole spirit cooking thing, it's all, it's all, look, it's all very creepy.
[01:04:34.935 --> 01:04:39.937]  And as you know, they have, they prefer male children before the age of 13.
[01:04:39.937 --> 01:04:45.180]  That's why the age 13 little men has, has been, um, significant forever.
[01:04:45.180 --> 01:04:48.843]  And that's why this whole Jeffrey Epstein coverup is so vile.
[01:04:48.843 --> 01:04:50.083]  And that's right.
[01:04:50.083 --> 01:04:50.724]  God bless you.
[01:04:50.724 --> 01:04:51.484]  We'll air your podcast.
[01:04:51.484 --> 01:04:51.824]  Thank you, sir.
[01:04:51.824 --> 01:04:52.545]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:52.545 --> 01:04:52.965]  Stay with us.

[01:06:08.843 --> 01:06:11.505]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[01:06:11.505 --> 01:06:14.468]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:06:14.468 --> 01:06:17.130]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:06:17.130 --> 01:06:29.140]  Caitlin Bennett is going to be joining us here in a few minutes.
[01:06:29.140 --> 01:06:30.441]  She's our own reporter.
[01:06:30.441 --> 01:06:31.682]  She's a Penn State gun girl.
[01:06:33.152 --> 01:06:36.256]  And, but she also does a lot of reporting for InfoWars.com.
[01:06:36.256 --> 01:06:39.199]  We're very, very honored to have her on air with us.
[01:06:39.199 --> 01:06:48.790]  In fact, I told her, I said, listen, we want to pay you to do your reports and finance you and support you and help you, but, you know, I don't want you to get banned or blackballed for being associated with InfoWars.
[01:06:48.790 --> 01:06:53.375]  She said, well, the only way I'll work with InfoWars is if I can say I'm with InfoWars.
[01:06:54.016 --> 01:06:59.981]  So she can go out there and face the libtards, face their fascism, face their threats and face the censorship.
[01:06:59.981 --> 01:07:01.862]  And so she's she's bold.
[01:07:01.862 --> 01:07:03.924]  And I understand her thought process.
[01:07:03.924 --> 01:07:04.704]  So we appreciate her.
[01:07:04.704 --> 01:07:09.308]  It's the same way with Millie Weaver, because I don't really tell reporters what to do around here.
[01:07:09.308 --> 01:07:15.793]  I just try to I try to let them go because I know they're good people and just turn them loose.
[01:07:15.793 --> 01:07:17.754]  But.
[01:07:17.754 --> 01:07:22.197]  She's really right, if we don't all stand up for each other, we're all going to lose our free speech, and that's why coming up,
[01:07:23.218 --> 01:07:28.902]  In the next hour, this Tommy Robinson interview, ladies and gentlemen, is as big as it gets.
[01:07:28.902 --> 01:07:35.827]  And that's why within a few hours of it getting a million and a half views on Instagram and on Facebook, his accounts were deleted.
[01:07:35.827 --> 01:07:39.510]  The British folk hero that exposed the giant Islamic child kidnapping rings.
[01:07:39.510 --> 01:07:41.551]  It's all been confirmed, thousands of convictions.
[01:07:41.551 --> 01:07:46.615]  Instead of getting national awards, he's been thrown in prison twice.
[01:07:46.615 --> 01:07:50.718]  And physically attacked all over the street by professors dressed up as Antifa.
[01:07:51.886 --> 01:07:54.609]  But this new video is posted on InfoWars.com.
[01:07:54.609 --> 01:07:56.471]  We'll put that back on screen, thank you.
[01:07:56.471 --> 01:08:02.897]  Tommy Robinson documentary, hashtag panodrama, being blocked everywhere.
[01:08:03.806 --> 01:08:08.508]  Free Speech and Crosshairs as Globalist Corporations Move to Silence Independent Voices.
[01:08:08.508 --> 01:08:11.089]  Now, that's one of the earlier posts from today.
[01:08:11.089 --> 01:08:12.170]  I went and wrote one earlier.
[01:08:12.170 --> 01:08:14.551]  I would imagine it's on Infowars.com.
[01:08:14.551 --> 01:08:15.712]  Let's see.
[01:08:15.712 --> 01:08:18.353]  Maybe just put the first page of Infowars.com.
[01:08:18.353 --> 01:08:22.915]  And Newswars.com is the one you want to send out because it's not as censored or blocked as much.
[01:08:22.915 --> 01:08:25.116]  And scroll down there for me, thank you.
[01:08:25.116 --> 01:08:27.857]  And go through the little blocks here because I'm going to plug it now.
[01:08:27.857 --> 01:08:33.180]  And so, it's posted in full from the YouTube version
[01:08:34.457 --> 01:08:41.521]  They're on the site, and we need people to go get it and get it out to everybody they know.
[01:08:41.521 --> 01:08:42.882]  There it is right at the top, exactly.
[01:08:42.882 --> 01:08:45.444]  It's right there in the center column.
[01:08:45.444 --> 01:08:52.008]  Let's go back to newswars.com.
[01:08:52.008 --> 01:08:56.250]  Tommy Robinson documentary, hashtag panadrama, being blocked everywhere.
[01:08:56.250 --> 01:08:57.311]  Well, that's not what I wrote.
[01:08:58.881 --> 01:09:00.323]  It's... I'm not mad.
[01:09:00.323 --> 01:09:01.625]  I'm just doing too much here.
[01:09:01.625 --> 01:09:02.706]  I'm going to recap.
[01:09:02.706 --> 01:09:04.288]  Probably going to rebroadcast for a while and then come back.
[01:09:04.288 --> 01:09:06.031]  That's what I'm going to do.
[01:09:06.031 --> 01:09:07.112]  Because I've got to go deal with this.
[01:09:07.112 --> 01:09:08.554]  This is really critical.
[01:09:08.554 --> 01:09:10.577]  This is critical!
[01:09:10.577 --> 01:09:12.038]  Critical!
[01:09:12.038 --> 01:09:15.303]  That we say we have the banned video so people get it!
[01:09:16.243 --> 01:09:17.745]  That's what the victory is.
[01:09:17.745 --> 01:09:20.748]  We have to say, here it is, get it while you can.
[01:09:20.748 --> 01:09:25.953]  Because this is a major intelligence operation to shut down the independent media in this country.
[01:09:25.953 --> 01:09:26.854]  And in the UK.
[01:09:26.854 --> 01:09:31.078]  And we have them caught trying to set him up for sexual assault and crimes.
[01:09:31.078 --> 01:09:34.481]  We have them, it's funded by Soros, this will bring them down.
[01:09:34.481 --> 01:09:40.047]  This torpedo, if loaded in a tube of a submarine, and fired at the enemy,
[01:09:41.161 --> 01:09:46.167]  Dead Broadside will blow them to hell politically and shank them!
[01:09:46.167 --> 01:09:55.578]  Let's use a Hobbit analogy of the black arrow and smog.
[01:09:56.769 --> 01:09:59.330]  But we have to tell people.
[01:09:59.330 --> 01:10:02.052]  We have to tell them that they are afraid of this film.
[01:10:02.052 --> 01:10:03.473]  They're trying to block it.
[01:10:03.473 --> 01:10:04.513]  They're trying to block it.
[01:10:04.513 --> 01:10:08.736]  This is the proof of what they're doing to us, what they're doing to Tommy, what they did to Kavanaugh.
[01:10:08.736 --> 01:10:10.057]  This is the proof.
[01:10:10.057 --> 01:10:12.978]  I'm gonna go to rebroadcast.
[01:10:12.978 --> 01:10:14.539]  Until the next segment, bring Caitlin back.
[01:10:14.539 --> 01:10:15.600]  She's awesome.
[01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:16.560]  Global bombshell!
[01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:20.042]  BBC caught working with MI5 to frame and imprison journalists.
[01:10:20.042 --> 01:10:22.524]  Now that's the name of the live feed show.
[01:10:24.473 --> 01:10:28.656]  The YouTube is posted on both those pages.
[01:10:28.656 --> 01:10:40.243]  But there's another page that says, see the banned Panadrama film exposing the BBC and MI5 trying to imprison journalists.
[01:10:41.397 --> 01:10:42.318]  That's the headline.
[01:10:42.318 --> 01:10:43.819]  And I'm not mad at the crew.
[01:10:43.819 --> 01:10:48.462]  What happens is I get so much energy on the show, like kind of a race car engine, I over-rev.
[01:10:48.462 --> 01:10:51.825]  Because we're having victory after victory after victory.
[01:10:51.825 --> 01:10:56.748]  Behind the scenes, let me tell you, we're having huge victories come in, and it'll soon all be announced.
[01:10:56.748 --> 01:11:00.071]  Devastation of the globalists, ladies and gentlemen, thanks to you taking action.
[01:11:00.919 --> 01:11:04.201]  But, so she can comment on it when we come back, because she's got so many irons in the fire.
[01:11:04.201 --> 01:11:08.663]  Leftists saying that universities saying put Trump supporters in re-education camps.
[01:11:08.663 --> 01:11:10.304]  That video was on drugreport.com yesterday.
[01:11:10.304 --> 01:11:14.486]  She's gone on Logan's Big Giant podcast, reaching tens of millions a few days ago.
[01:11:14.486 --> 01:11:15.726]  That's gone viral.
[01:11:15.726 --> 01:11:20.749]  She went out and showed how out of 50-something people, two people knew who the president was, or that he was 40.
[01:11:21.089 --> 01:11:22.269]  Fifth President.
[01:11:22.269 --> 01:11:23.370]  All of that.
[01:11:23.370 --> 01:11:24.370]  So there's so much to cover.
[01:11:24.370 --> 01:11:39.196]  But the big one is the black Israelites, the same sect that was attacking the Covington kids, that the Native Americans said he was protecting the big black men, middle-aged black men and others, from the little kids.
[01:11:39.196 --> 01:11:41.337]  So I thought we'd play you a few minutes of this.
[01:11:41.337 --> 01:11:45.859]  It goes on and on and on, saying that she's white, so she needs to be killed.
[01:11:46.710 --> 01:11:48.311]  And this is who the mainstream media defends.
[01:11:48.311 --> 01:11:50.171]  They know full well who the black Israelites are.
[01:11:50.171 --> 01:11:52.072]  They've been around for decades.
[01:11:52.072 --> 01:11:53.513]  You know, I walked out of a mall in Houston.
[01:11:53.513 --> 01:11:57.734]  They're like, it's Alex Jones, the devil man who'll soon be killed.
[01:11:57.734 --> 01:11:59.235]  God will kill him.
[01:11:59.235 --> 01:12:00.395]  Soon he will be murdered.
[01:12:00.395 --> 01:12:01.456]  The time is coming.
[01:12:01.456 --> 01:12:07.978]  His intestines will be strewn across the planet.
[01:12:07.978 --> 01:12:10.439]  So let's go out to break with like four or five minutes of that.
[01:12:10.439 --> 01:12:11.380]  We'll come back with Caitlin Bennett.
[01:12:11.380 --> 01:12:11.620]  Here it is.
[01:12:12.839 --> 01:12:16.623]  God said to prepare your butts for slaughter today!
[01:12:16.623 --> 01:12:18.665]  Does he deserve to die?
[01:12:18.665 --> 01:12:22.368]  God said yes.
[01:12:22.368 --> 01:12:29.235]  Can you tell me what this is?
[01:12:29.235 --> 01:12:33.940]  Yeah, can you just explain, I guess, what you're doing or what your group represents?
[01:12:35.215 --> 01:12:48.239]  Okay, according to the Bible, black people, Hispanic people, Native American Indians, we are the 12 lost tribes of the nation of Israel, according to biblical history, world history, and archaeology, so on and so forth, man.
[01:12:48.239 --> 01:12:49.599]  So what does your group represent?
[01:12:49.599 --> 01:12:50.359]  What's your message?
[01:12:50.359 --> 01:12:52.620]  If you could give your message in one sentence, what would it be?
[01:12:53.285 --> 01:12:56.967]  The message you want to send us is that we are the chosen people of God in Christ.
[01:12:56.967 --> 01:12:59.108]  Christ is a black man according to the Bible.
[01:12:59.108 --> 01:13:04.892]  Christ is very, very upset with America because of what America did to God's chosen people.
[01:13:04.892 --> 01:13:12.156]  And Christ is going to come back with the angels, what they call UFOs, really the vehicles are the angels, what they call UFOs.
[01:13:12.156 --> 01:13:19.560]  Christ is going to come back in the chariots to deliver the 12 tribes of the nation of Israel from this current captivity that we're in.
[01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:20.841]  Okay, and what is your group called?
[01:13:21.547 --> 01:13:25.410]  We are the Hebrew Israelites according to the Bible.
[01:13:25.410 --> 01:13:34.178]  Is this the group that was at the Covington Catholic Controversy telling people, telling the white kids there that their intestines should be strewn all over the ground?
[01:13:34.178 --> 01:13:35.980]  Is this the same group?
[01:13:35.980 --> 01:13:41.285]  We are not the same group, but we all teach and use the Bible to back up what we're saying.
[01:13:41.285 --> 01:13:43.086]  So they use the Bible, we use the Bible.
[01:13:43.086 --> 01:13:43.807]  You see what I'm saying?
[01:13:44.167 --> 01:13:45.948]  So they were also black, Hebrew, Israelites.
[01:13:45.948 --> 01:13:46.849]  Were they not the same group?
[01:14:03.317 --> 01:14:06.578]  It's not black Hebrew, it's like we are Hebrew-Israelite.
[01:14:06.578 --> 01:14:11.120]  Okay, was that not the same group involved in that Covington case at the Washington D.C.
[01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:11.560]  Memorial?
[01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:12.861]  Was that not the same group?
[01:14:12.861 --> 01:14:15.222]  We're not the same group, but we know them.
[01:14:15.222 --> 01:14:18.443]  Will you disavow the things that they said to those white kids?
[01:14:18.443 --> 01:14:19.243]  What things are you talking about?
[01:14:19.243 --> 01:14:20.103]  Disavow what?
[01:14:20.103 --> 01:14:23.265]  They said that they were incest, they were cousin f***s, they're going to hell.
[01:14:23.265 --> 01:14:25.986]  They said that their intestines should be strewn across the floor.
[01:14:26.866 --> 01:14:28.649]  Can you disavow those statements?
[01:14:28.649 --> 01:14:31.392]  Give me Isaiah 1421.
[01:14:31.392 --> 01:14:32.994]  Will you just disavow?
[01:14:32.994 --> 01:14:37.661]  Will you disavow that they told those teenage kids that their intestines should be strewn across the floor?
[01:14:37.661 --> 01:14:38.982]  We're doing what God gotta say, okay?
[01:14:38.982 --> 01:14:41.466]  Will you disavow as someone that knows them?
[01:14:41.466 --> 01:14:42.667]  We represent God.
[01:14:43.328 --> 01:14:47.332]  We know them, they represent God, so we're gonna read to you what God gotta say, okay?
[01:14:47.332 --> 01:14:51.135]  This is the book of Isaiah, chapter 14, verse 21.
[01:14:51.135 --> 01:14:53.197]  Prepare slaughter for his children.
[01:14:53.197 --> 01:14:58.101]  God said prepare slaughter for his children, meaning the Caucasian race, prepare slaughter for their children.
[01:14:58.101 --> 01:14:58.622]  Go ahead.
[01:14:58.622 --> 01:15:00.804]  For the iniquity of their fathers.
[01:15:00.804 --> 01:15:02.925]  For what your forefathers did during the time of slavery.
[01:15:02.925 --> 01:15:04.227]  So you won't disavow it.
[01:15:04.927 --> 01:15:08.068]  You think it's okay to say that to teenagers?
[01:15:08.068 --> 01:15:14.370]  That they do not rise, nor possess the land, nor fill the face of the world with cities.
[01:15:14.370 --> 01:15:16.131]  Now give me Luke.
[01:15:16.131 --> 01:15:17.331]  I'm gonna take that as a yes.
[01:15:17.331 --> 01:15:19.932]  You guys think it's okay to say that?
[01:15:19.932 --> 01:15:21.472]  I just want a yes or a no.
[01:15:21.472 --> 01:15:22.273]  Yes or no.
[01:15:22.273 --> 01:15:23.573]  Yes or no.
[01:15:23.573 --> 01:15:25.554]  Do you think it's okay to treat them like that?
[01:15:25.554 --> 01:15:26.114]  Yes or no.
[01:15:27.695 --> 01:15:28.976]  Look at that sign down there.
[01:15:28.976 --> 01:15:30.237]  I'm going to take that as a no.
[01:15:30.237 --> 01:15:31.538]  I'm going to take that as a no.
[01:15:31.538 --> 01:15:32.879]  I'm going to take that as a no.
[01:15:32.879 --> 01:15:33.620]  That's gross.
[01:15:33.620 --> 01:15:35.121]  You won't disavow the people.
[01:15:35.121 --> 01:15:36.022]  Can you disavow it?
[01:15:36.022 --> 01:15:39.345]  Listen, was not the black people during the time of slavery, was it?
[01:15:39.345 --> 01:15:42.848]  Was not their children used for alligator bait?
[01:15:42.848 --> 01:15:44.750]  Was not their children's fingers cut off?
[01:15:44.750 --> 01:15:51.716]  I am asking if it's okay that someone you know that's in your organization told these teenagers.
[01:15:51.716 --> 01:15:53.517]  I will answer your question.
[01:15:57.505 --> 01:15:58.765]  Maybe not today.
[01:15:58.765 --> 01:16:00.045]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[01:16:00.045 --> 01:16:03.786]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[01:16:03.786 --> 01:16:04.866]  Forget bunkers.
[01:16:04.866 --> 01:16:06.687]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[01:16:06.687 --> 01:16:08.407]  You need Survivalist Camps.

[01:16:57.296 --> 01:16:58.517]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[01:16:58.517 --> 01:17:02.442]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[01:17:02.442 --> 01:17:03.983]  I sued the IRS and won.
[01:17:03.983 --> 01:17:06.946]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[01:17:06.946 --> 01:17:12.152]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[01:17:12.492 --> 01:17:13.692]  I can help you, too.

[01:18:16.663 --> 01:18:26.746]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[01:18:26.746 --> 01:18:35.290]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.

[01:18:38.611 --> 01:18:45.615]  It is a total game changer when it comes to easy to use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you like.
[01:18:45.615 --> 01:18:47.136]  Warning though, it's very, very strong.
[01:18:47.136 --> 01:18:48.617]  It lasts 10 hours.
[01:18:48.617 --> 01:18:55.300]  So take a half pack the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[01:18:55.300 --> 01:18:56.801]  TurboForce at m4slive.com
[01:18:58.527 --> 01:19:11.935]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship and I've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most buried, the most suppressed.
[01:19:11.935 --> 01:19:22.982]  And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night all the arrogant leftist authoritarians like the Young Turks and others get so butthurt when Trump won.
[01:19:24.293 --> 01:19:26.221]  They don't want us to have that victory.
[01:19:26.221 --> 01:19:28.894]  They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[01:19:30.265 --> 01:19:34.587]  And that's why the globalists, Hillary and others, are trying to shut InfoWars down.
[01:19:34.587 --> 01:19:41.129]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech, about taking your very sovereignty away.
[01:19:41.129 --> 01:19:43.450]  This country is in a war!
[01:19:43.450 --> 01:19:54.134]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you, if you don't spread the articles and videos, and if you don't financially get the great products we have and fund us, and the 360 win, we're dead in the water.
[01:19:54.134 --> 01:19:57.715]  I'm in your hands, you're in my hands, InfoWarsStore.com, thank you!
[01:20:00.862 --> 01:20:03.447]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:19.986 --> 01:20:28.250]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:28.250 --> 01:20:37.494]  Next hour we're going to air the verboten first salvo in three Tommy Robinson documentaries that are coming out.
[01:20:37.494 --> 01:20:48.659]  Panodrama, a takeoff on the name of the BBC show Panorama, one of their top shows, caught trying to frame Tommy for sexual assault.
[01:20:51.588 --> 01:20:53.089]  It's unbelievable.
[01:20:53.089 --> 01:20:57.413]  And they've got two more salvos coming out, even worse.
[01:20:57.413 --> 01:20:59.074]  Now why is it important?
[01:20:59.074 --> 01:21:00.175]  It's the exact same model.
[01:21:00.175 --> 01:21:01.316]  We even have the secret documents.
[01:21:01.316 --> 01:21:02.757]  We're going to be covering it.
[01:21:02.757 --> 01:21:06.320]  It's all Soros funded.
[01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:09.403]  It's the same model used by Media Matters here.
[01:21:09.403 --> 01:21:12.865]  And it is beyond organized crime.
[01:21:12.865 --> 01:21:17.229]  It is intelligence agency tactics used to take down other countries.
[01:21:19.104 --> 01:21:20.665]  Totally illegal!
[01:21:20.665 --> 01:21:27.369]  Incredible scandal!
[01:21:27.369 --> 01:21:28.290]  That's coming up.
[01:21:28.290 --> 01:21:32.753]  Caitlin Bennett, again, is on fire with all the great work she's doing.
[01:21:32.753 --> 01:21:40.818]  She doesn't like to rattle off all of her achievements, but again, I'm not against Fox News, I'm not against Turning Point USA, but they all work the same.
[01:21:40.818 --> 01:21:41.939]  They get people in a stable.
[01:21:44.208 --> 01:21:50.915]  And they basically just control them, and they go out and do some good work, but then you control the whole movement, control the whole spectrum.
[01:21:50.915 --> 01:21:52.577]  And that's just how those groups work.
[01:21:52.577 --> 01:21:56.981]  They do good work, and they wanted to get her on board and all the rest of it.
[01:21:56.981 --> 01:21:59.043]  She approached him for some.
[01:21:59.043 --> 01:22:03.127]  She's been on Gascon, very familiar with her work, but now it seems like
[01:22:04.048 --> 01:22:09.450]  When they, then some of these groups will use surrogates to ridicule her and attack her and make fun of her.
[01:22:09.450 --> 01:22:19.134]  When people like the fact that, I wouldn't call it provincial, she's pretty sophisticated, but she has a provincial side, so do I, kind of a countryside, that they made a big joke out of it and tried to like make her go cry in the corner.
[01:22:19.134 --> 01:22:22.055]  Instead, you've gone from being really good to awesome.
[01:22:22.055 --> 01:22:28.618]  I mean, everybody's just sitting back with marvel at how just every day, two or three bombshells.
[01:22:28.618 --> 01:22:29.578]  What happened to you, girl?
[01:22:31.246 --> 01:22:31.947]  Well, thank you!
[01:22:31.947 --> 01:22:36.771]  Well, basically, I like to take the negative energy that people throw at me.
[01:22:36.771 --> 01:22:42.837]  Like, they try to lie about me or they try to make me feel bad because I don't do things the way that they want me to.
[01:22:42.837 --> 01:22:45.980]  I don't spread the message the way they want me to.
[01:22:45.980 --> 01:22:48.403]  So, I take that negative energy and I just...
[01:22:49.003 --> 01:23:00.306]  Focus it into how do I prove them wrong that I'm not doing good things and then I come out on top every single time and you know, it's working and I'm so proud.
[01:23:00.306 --> 01:23:02.667]  I'm proud of myself that I'm able to do it.
[01:23:02.667 --> 01:23:05.968]  Well, that's right.
[01:23:05.968 --> 01:23:08.728]  And everything you do goes viral.
[01:23:08.728 --> 01:23:10.149]  Almost everything.
[01:23:10.149 --> 01:23:10.429]  Yeah.
[01:23:10.429 --> 01:23:14.530]  I mean, I don't know if it's because people hate me so much they can't stop looking at my stuff.
[01:23:15.123 --> 01:23:29.567]  Or if you know somewhere out there I am impacting the silent majority and they're sharing my things so you know somewhere along the lines it's happening and that's all that matters is that people are seeing me expose the left.
[01:23:29.567 --> 01:23:31.828]  Let's talk about the black Israelites because
[01:23:34.341 --> 01:23:42.330]  I've run into them for 20 years, and because I'm against black genocide of black people, they'll say, well, you've got some Native American, don't you?
[01:23:42.330 --> 01:23:43.732]  Well, we're not going to have to kill you.
[01:23:43.732 --> 01:23:46.054]  And I say, listen, you're no different than the Nazis.
[01:23:46.054 --> 01:23:47.616]  You just don't have a big army.
[01:23:47.616 --> 01:23:50.599]  And this is the same crap where every group always says this.
[01:23:50.599 --> 01:23:51.580]  And you're shameful.
[01:23:51.580 --> 01:23:52.701]  You're absolutely shameful.
[01:23:53.502 --> 01:23:55.183]  And I don't have time to play the whole 10-minute video.
[01:23:55.183 --> 01:23:56.925]  People can go watch it on Infowars.com.
[01:23:56.925 --> 01:23:57.625]  It's riveting stuff.
[01:23:57.625 --> 01:23:59.186]  I just don't want to hear it again.
[01:23:59.186 --> 01:24:00.888]  About a cave dweller!
[01:24:00.888 --> 01:24:02.789]  You're going to be killed!
[01:24:02.789 --> 01:24:05.391]  And it's just like, it's so ridiculous.
[01:24:05.391 --> 01:24:11.215]  But because they're leftist and they're black, they think they can just say white people are inherently evil.
[01:24:11.215 --> 01:24:12.636]  And then he's like, oh, well, you're white.
[01:24:12.636 --> 01:24:13.597]  All whites own slaves.
[01:24:13.597 --> 01:24:15.919]  2% of people here before 1867 had any slave
[01:24:20.785 --> 01:24:22.006]  Holdings, 2%.
[01:24:22.006 --> 01:24:23.967]  So 98% didn't.
[01:24:23.967 --> 01:24:27.649]  And then most of the population moved here after the Civil War.
[01:24:27.649 --> 01:24:31.170]  That's when we had the explosion, the quadrupling.
[01:24:31.170 --> 01:24:33.271]  And so people in Europe were serfs.
[01:24:33.271 --> 01:24:35.833]  They were slaves on the land or from Russia.
[01:24:35.833 --> 01:24:43.497]  And so the idea that white people all are guilty because some white people hundreds of years ago did something is crazy.
[01:24:43.497 --> 01:24:45.238]  But the left is adopting it where
[01:24:46.438 --> 01:24:48.660]  Again, if your neighbor does something wrong, well then you're in trouble.
[01:24:48.660 --> 01:24:50.241]  That's what the Soviet Union did.
[01:24:50.241 --> 01:24:51.162]  That's what Hitler did.
[01:24:51.162 --> 01:24:59.589]  If somebody shot an army officer in the German military in World War II in Poland, or Russia, they'd kill the whole street, literally.
[01:24:59.589 --> 01:25:06.194]  And it's the same thing of authoritarians, where they say, somebody did something a long time ago, so you're gonna have to die.
[01:25:06.194 --> 01:25:07.135]  That's psychotic.
[01:25:08.427 --> 01:25:09.428]  Yeah, it's super crazy.
[01:25:09.428 --> 01:25:17.332]  So we dabbled a little bit of where we wanted to go to do street interviews, because we were just going to ask people about the 45th president and about toxic masculinity.
[01:25:17.332 --> 01:25:23.595]  And I hear in a loudspeaker this rhetoric about, they're the chosen people of God.
[01:25:23.595 --> 01:25:30.979]  And I was like, this sounds like the same Israelite group that was at the Covington Catholic controversy in Washington, D.C.
[01:25:30.979 --> 01:25:35.162]  And I went up to them and I was like, this is a gold mine.
[01:25:35.162 --> 01:25:37.263]  Like, I was so happy that I ran into them.
[01:25:37.857 --> 01:25:39.732]  I started off really polite at first, you know.
[01:25:40.603 --> 01:25:41.243]  What's your group?
[01:25:41.243 --> 01:25:42.064]  What are you doing here?
[01:25:42.064 --> 01:25:49.008]  And then once I realized, yes, this was the same group and they admitted to it, I asked them to disavow those racist remarks.
[01:25:49.008 --> 01:25:52.530]  And they were worse than what they were.
[01:25:52.530 --> 01:25:59.613]  The group that was at the Covington Catholic in Washington, D.C., they were worse than what they were saying because they were pointing at me.
[01:25:59.613 --> 01:26:02.615]  They were pointing at my friends saying, you deserve to die.
[01:26:02.615 --> 01:26:05.076]  God said you deserve the sword.
[01:26:05.076 --> 01:26:07.698]  If the viewer should definitely go back and watch that whole video.
[01:26:08.496 --> 01:26:11.038]  Because they just keep saying more and more ridiculous things.
[01:26:28.234 --> 01:26:30.135]  White people are vilified in the media.
[01:26:30.135 --> 01:26:36.698]  The left tells us that we were slave owners and we need to pay reparations and we're bad people because we're white.
[01:26:36.698 --> 01:26:40.360]  And there is no such thing as racism against whites.
[01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:41.740]  We're fed that in college.
[01:26:41.740 --> 01:26:44.742]  I was fed that from my professors at my university.
[01:26:44.742 --> 01:26:46.002]  And I'll have New York Times articles.
[01:26:46.002 --> 01:26:48.284]  Can black people or Hispanics be racist?
[01:26:48.284 --> 01:26:49.124]  It's tribalism.
[01:26:49.124 --> 01:26:49.744]  Of course they can.
[01:26:51.647 --> 01:27:00.677]  You know, this is a party of science and truth and knowledge, but they will completely change the definitions of words to fit their needs.
[01:27:00.677 --> 01:27:02.219]  They change the definition of racism.
[01:27:02.219 --> 01:27:07.105]  Like a man with a large genitals is a woman.
[01:27:07.105 --> 01:27:08.266]  No, he's not.
[01:27:08.266 --> 01:27:09.888]  He's a man calling himself a woman.
[01:27:11.073 --> 01:27:11.573]  Exactly.
[01:27:11.573 --> 01:27:18.278]  They change the definitions to fit their needs and then they tell us we're the bad people when we try to stand up for the truth.
[01:27:18.278 --> 01:27:21.461]  And that's exactly what's going on with those Hebrew Israelites.
[01:27:21.461 --> 01:27:23.362]  Why isn't Fox News picking this up?
[01:27:23.362 --> 01:27:25.964]  Why isn't CNN picking this up?
[01:27:25.964 --> 01:27:28.706]  And MSNBC, why aren't they picking this up?
[01:27:28.706 --> 01:27:29.626]  This is dangerous.
[01:27:29.626 --> 01:27:31.608]  I don't see, you know,
[01:27:32.188 --> 01:27:45.687]  If these were white people out there saying that blacks deserve to die, and white people were the chosen people, and we are the superior race, then, oh my gosh, it would be, we need every white person's head on a stake right now.
[01:27:45.687 --> 01:27:46.488]  But they get a pass.
[01:27:48.323 --> 01:27:50.544]  Well, take Sarah Zhang.
[01:27:50.544 --> 01:27:52.645]  She said whites need to be exterminated.
[01:27:52.645 --> 01:27:55.887]  They're cave-dwelling goblins that live in holes.
[01:27:55.887 --> 01:27:57.047]  She can't wait till we're all gone.
[01:27:57.047 --> 01:27:59.148]  She loves being mean to white people.
[01:27:59.148 --> 01:28:01.469]  And the New York Times defended that.
[01:28:01.469 --> 01:28:10.394]  So, this is the insane ethos where they have children's shows on YouTube where they teach Asian kids that whites are inherently evil.
[01:28:10.394 --> 01:28:12.995]  I mean, these people are whack jobs.
[01:28:12.995 --> 01:28:14.996]  But it's being encouraged by the political system.
[01:28:16.374 --> 01:28:17.194]  It is.
[01:28:17.194 --> 01:28:21.816]  It's really scary because it's more than just saying white people are evil.
[01:28:21.816 --> 01:28:31.299]  These guys are out there saying that we deserve to die and they're trying to trick people into thinking that's what the Bible says and that's what the Word of God is.
[01:28:31.299 --> 01:28:36.700]  And if you are a believer of God, I'm sure that you know that that is not what God says.
[01:28:36.700 --> 01:28:45.823]  Also, they're taking stuff out of context from the Old Testament when the tribes were fighting groups that would also exterminate all of them.
[01:28:47.034 --> 01:28:50.176]  Or they would kill the men and take the women and children.
[01:28:50.176 --> 01:28:55.680]  And so those are genocidal wars in the Old Testament, specifically naming the wars.
[01:28:55.680 --> 01:28:56.581]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:57.199 --> 01:28:59.581]  Know someone with a drinking or drug problem?
[01:28:59.581 --> 01:29:02.444]  Learn how to get sober after we share these stories.
[01:29:02.444 --> 01:29:07.510]  I was 35 with two beautiful children when my life and addiction started to spiral out of control.
[01:29:07.510 --> 01:29:14.697]  After my divorce, I went into a depression cycle and started drinking more often and using prescription drugs.
[01:29:14.697 --> 01:29:19.262]  After my second DWI and arrest, my ex-husband threatened to take our children away from me.
[01:29:19.844 --> 01:29:23.486]  I was 17 when I became addicted to heroin and meth.
[01:29:23.486 --> 01:29:26.587]  I thought I could quit on my own, but I couldn't.
[01:29:26.587 --> 01:29:29.229]  It hit me when I was arrested.
[01:29:29.229 --> 01:29:30.729]  Get sober now.
[01:29:30.729 --> 01:29:34.071]  Your private insurance may cover costs and we'll get you here.
[01:29:34.071 --> 01:29:34.871]  It's simple.

[01:29:58.533 --> 01:29:59.033]  It's simple.
[01:29:59.033 --> 01:30:05.157]  If you want to beat the globalists, if you want to take on the new world order, I'm not doing Bitcoin pump and dumps with Jack Dorsey.
[01:30:05.157 --> 01:30:07.639]  I'm not sitting here selling you cancer cures.
[01:30:07.639 --> 01:30:11.261]  I'm not sitting here, you know, selling you late term abortion and all great it is.
[01:30:11.261 --> 01:30:14.023]  I just go out and say, what is the top heart pill?
[01:30:14.023 --> 01:30:15.123]  What is the top tumor?
[01:30:15.123 --> 01:30:17.265]  It's the best seller because it's anti-inflammatory.
[01:30:17.265 --> 01:30:19.186]  And what's the best lab in the country?
[01:30:19.286 --> 01:30:20.347]  Okay, they're the highest rated.
[01:30:20.347 --> 01:30:22.288]  I'm like, you're only 50% curcuminoid?
[01:30:22.288 --> 01:30:26.010]  Well, yeah, they only put $5 product in the bottle, but that's still incredible, sir.
[01:30:26.010 --> 01:30:29.052]  I'm like, uh, what's the hottest you could do a month later?
[01:30:29.052 --> 01:30:29.312]  Uh, 90, 95%.
[01:30:29.312 --> 01:30:30.893]  No one's ever done that.
[01:30:30.893 --> 01:30:32.674]  I said, how much does that cost per bottle?
[01:30:32.674 --> 01:30:33.615]  It costs $10.
[01:30:33.615 --> 01:30:35.136]  No one's ever done that.
[01:30:35.136 --> 01:30:36.937]  Sir, the average competitor's 3 to 5%.
[01:30:36.937 --> 01:30:37.597]  The top brand's 50%.
[01:30:37.597 --> 01:30:39.258]  I'm like, we're gonna have 95% curcuminoid.
[01:30:41.800 --> 01:30:44.722]  I mean, you understand, like, that's, like, our information's explosive?
[01:30:44.722 --> 01:30:45.342]  Our fish oil.
[01:30:45.342 --> 01:30:47.864]  I go out and I get the cleanest, the best.
[01:30:47.864 --> 01:30:48.925]  My children take it.
[01:30:48.925 --> 01:30:53.268]  You think I'm gonna give you fish oil that isn't the very damn best on my soul?
[01:30:53.268 --> 01:30:56.290]  You think I'm gonna screw somebody over like one of these devil worshippers?
[01:30:56.290 --> 01:30:56.750]  Never!
[01:30:56.750 --> 01:30:58.151]  InfoWars.com.
[01:30:58.151 --> 01:31:05.876]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from InfoWars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[01:31:05.876 --> 01:31:06.357]  It's you.

[01:31:09.634 --> 01:31:18.342]  It is you, the info warriors across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.

[01:33:01.851 --> 01:33:04.452]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:15.296 --> 01:33:17.418]  Big Brother.
[01:33:17.418 --> 01:33:20.200]  Mainstream media.
[01:33:20.200 --> 01:33:22.803]  Government cover-ups.
[01:33:22.803 --> 01:33:24.724]  You want answers?
[01:33:24.724 --> 01:33:26.626]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:26.626 --> 01:33:35.914]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:35.914 --> 01:33:40.058]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com, reporter Caitlin Bennett is with us.
[01:33:41.295 --> 01:33:44.222]  And, like I said, she's been on fire.
[01:33:44.222 --> 01:33:46.246]  Really triggering the left.
[01:33:46.246 --> 01:33:47.128]  And so many others.
[01:33:47.128 --> 01:33:48.471]  You know, there's a Penn State gun girl.
[01:33:50.928 --> 01:33:55.730]  I want to get into you going on Logan Paul, who does reach tens of millions of people.
[01:33:55.730 --> 01:33:58.671]  You keep saying he's the biggest podcast in the world.
[01:33:58.671 --> 01:33:59.492]  No.
[01:33:59.492 --> 01:34:01.993]  We were the biggest podcast in the world until they delisted us.
[01:34:01.993 --> 01:34:03.573]  Now it's Joe Rogan.
[01:34:03.573 --> 01:34:05.294]  So, that's just not true.
[01:34:05.294 --> 01:34:07.215]  But, you know, the guy's funny, whatever.
[01:34:07.215 --> 01:34:11.937]  It's kind of the college kids that the tweenies and 13-year-olds, you know, look up to.
[01:34:11.937 --> 01:34:18.720]  My 14-year-old daughter, you know, likes Logan Paul because her whole school does.
[01:34:19.620 --> 01:34:23.081]  So it's important to reach out to these folks, and I'm glad you went on there.
[01:34:23.081 --> 01:34:27.463]  I did not put you up to the Turbo Force product placement.
[01:34:27.463 --> 01:34:31.024]  They got pretty mad about it and said, you owe us $12,000.
[01:34:31.024 --> 01:34:34.045]  I guess that's how much a plug on their show is.
[01:34:34.045 --> 01:34:45.929]  I mean, I got to say, it didn't really sell any Turbo Force because I don't think that the tweenies, 10-year-old girls, 12-year-old girls, I don't think that they're out there buying Turbo Force.
[01:34:45.929 --> 01:34:47.870]  Our audience is the military.
[01:34:48.590 --> 01:34:50.291]  Intelligence agencies and foreign governments.
[01:34:50.291 --> 01:34:52.053]  And I'm not putting Logan Paul down.
[01:34:52.053 --> 01:34:53.194]  He has an important audience.
[01:34:53.194 --> 01:34:54.094]  Children!
[01:34:54.094 --> 01:34:55.235]  But I'm glad you went on the show.
[01:34:55.235 --> 01:34:56.196]  So I want to get into that.
[01:34:56.196 --> 01:35:01.480]  Then we'll get into the college students, the vast majority saying, put conservatives in re-education camps.
[01:35:01.480 --> 01:35:03.221]  Something Hillary's actually called for.
[01:35:03.221 --> 01:35:05.783]  We need fun camps for men to re-educate them.
[01:35:05.783 --> 01:35:06.763]  Just introducing the idea.
[01:35:06.763 --> 01:35:08.044]  But first, tell us about Logan Paul.
[01:35:08.044 --> 01:35:08.825]  We're going to play this clip.
[01:35:11.676 --> 01:35:17.741]  So, um, when I went on there, I was super nervous because I know that I wanted to bring the turbo force on there.
[01:35:17.741 --> 01:35:24.146]  One, completely as like just a joke, something fun to do because Logan is crazy.
[01:35:24.146 --> 01:35:28.870]  His entire podcast, his friends are just absolutely crazy.
[01:35:28.870 --> 01:35:31.172]  And I thought they would like get a laugh out of it.
[01:35:31.172 --> 01:35:38.417]  And it kind of didn't go the way I figured because then in their eyes, it kind of looked like I was trying to plug something for free.
[01:35:38.417 --> 01:35:38.978]  And I was like,
[01:35:39.608 --> 01:35:40.789]  Well, I'm just trying to be funny.
[01:35:40.789 --> 01:35:42.370]  Like, I'm trying to be funny.
[01:35:42.370 --> 01:35:44.431]  Um, you know, everybody... You did great, though!
[01:35:44.431 --> 01:35:47.653]  I mean, you should have gone further and dared him to snort it.
[01:35:47.653 --> 01:35:48.353]  I did!
[01:35:48.353 --> 01:35:52.255]  I did dare him to snort it, and he's like, I'm not snorting anything on my own podcast!
[01:35:52.255 --> 01:35:54.497]  And I was like, how do I handle this?
[01:35:54.497 --> 01:35:56.138]  Like, how do I think quick on my toes?
[01:35:56.138 --> 01:36:01.260]  Because I felt really weird after that, because I was like, oh my god, he thinks I'm disrespectful.
[01:36:01.260 --> 01:36:03.642]  Isn't he the guy that, like, makes fun of dead bodies and stuff?
[01:36:04.628 --> 01:36:07.669]  Yeah, that's what he is most commonly known for.
[01:36:07.669 --> 01:36:14.031]  And then afterwards... I gotta say, he looks like Jimmy Savelle's son.
[01:36:14.031 --> 01:36:17.232]  Yeah, but I mean, like, afterwards, I think everything calmed down.
[01:36:17.232 --> 01:36:21.413]  And then after we were done with the podcast, they were like, I think we'll actually try this.
[01:36:21.413 --> 01:36:25.354]  And I'm like, what can you just say that on air, instead of making me feel bad.
[01:36:26.911 --> 01:36:31.717]  And by the way, if he wants to go to a forest where the Japanese commit suicide, I think they have one of the highest rates in the world.
[01:36:31.717 --> 01:36:34.962]  That's his right to do it and make fun of the dead bodies.
[01:36:34.962 --> 01:36:37.105]  I'm not saying he should be taken off air.
[01:36:37.105 --> 01:36:39.569]  I can say that's very distasteful and I don't like it.
[01:36:39.569 --> 01:36:41.632]  Doesn't mean I want Logan Paul off the air.
[01:36:43.155 --> 01:36:43.695]  Absolutely.
[01:36:43.695 --> 01:36:55.621]  And I don't know if you've watched the whole podcast, but about, I would say an hour in, his co-host Mike ended up saying that you belong in a mental institution because of the things you said.
[01:36:55.621 --> 01:37:01.845]  And then they tried to bring up the fact that you've been banned off of Twitter, but they allow porn on Twitter, as that you're crazy.
[01:37:01.845 --> 01:37:10.229]  And I had to tell them that this is more about Twitter, that they're more scared of Alex Jones and his opinions than they are porn being on their website.
[01:37:10.509 --> 01:37:11.570]  So that's about an hour in.
[01:37:11.570 --> 01:37:12.530]  We'll try to find that.
[01:37:12.530 --> 01:37:20.994]  You know, what blows me away is that, are they as stupid as they act, or are they dumbing it down for young people?
[01:37:20.994 --> 01:37:24.056]  Because obviously they know that Galileo was censored.
[01:37:24.056 --> 01:37:27.518]  They obviously know that Anne Frank had to secretly write her diary.
[01:37:27.518 --> 01:37:30.159]  I mean, they know that usually people being censored are good guys, right?
[01:37:31.178 --> 01:37:37.106]  Well, that's why I, one of them, the Mike guy was kind of on the defensive about, you know, Alex Jones is bad.
[01:37:37.106 --> 01:37:38.728]  He's being censored for a reason.
[01:37:38.728 --> 01:37:42.373]  But Spencer, the guy that I was sitting right next to, he agreed with me.
[01:37:42.373 --> 01:37:45.818]  He's like, you know, there she has a point that Twitter is censoring.
[01:37:46.338 --> 01:37:50.542]  Alex and a bunch of other people when they allow porn on their website.
[01:37:50.542 --> 01:37:52.284]  So I think this is more about Twitter.
[01:37:52.284 --> 01:37:54.286]  He agreed with me that out.
[01:37:54.286 --> 01:38:01.313]  Also, I think I touched a point with Mike as well and I kind of opened their eyes to the censorship problem that Twitter is having.
[01:38:02.301 --> 01:38:04.903]  Well, I would love to invite Logan Paul on the show.
[01:38:04.903 --> 01:38:20.979]  I would also love to go on that broadcast because I'd like to be able to speak to my oldest daughter's audience and tell my daughter, now be good and don't vape like the other girls and don't smoke cigarettes, honey, and be good.
[01:38:23.945 --> 01:38:29.687]  It's just ridiculous to know that these guys aren't making a bigger issue out of censorship.
[01:38:29.687 --> 01:38:33.728]  They know full well that we were banned off YouTube.
[01:38:33.728 --> 01:38:37.110]  Yeah, and I think Logan understands that.
[01:38:37.110 --> 01:38:39.430]  Logan didn't talk a lot during the podcast.
[01:38:39.430 --> 01:38:41.471]  I think he was taking everything in.
[01:38:41.471 --> 01:38:47.994]  If you look and you watch his Facebook expressions as I'm talking to Mike and I'm talking to Spencer, Logan's just listening.
[01:38:47.994 --> 01:38:49.154]  He's kind of taking it in.
[01:38:49.654 --> 01:38:55.896]  Which I didn't mind at all because, you know, he's also taking it in, but his audience is taking it in as well.
[01:38:55.896 --> 01:39:01.377]  You know, his audience is getting perspective on gun rights and the Second Amendment that they probably didn't think they were ever going to watch.
[01:39:01.377 --> 01:39:04.718]  So that's out there now, and they're getting a perspective on censorship.
[01:39:04.718 --> 01:39:13.960]  And I think that Logan understands this because I'm honestly surprised that he even has a count-up because of the outrage over his Suicide Force video.
[01:39:13.960 --> 01:39:18.901]  So I think he understands very well that everybody could be censored at one point or the other.
[01:39:19.659 --> 01:39:22.581]  And by the way, I'm not being mean to Logan Paul.
[01:39:22.581 --> 01:39:26.323]  He literally, he has the same facial structure as Jimmy Savile.
[01:39:26.323 --> 01:39:28.665]  Jimmy Savile looked like a pedophile and was a pedophile.
[01:39:28.665 --> 01:39:29.906]  I'm not saying that Logan is that.
[01:39:29.906 --> 01:39:30.986]  I don't think he is.
[01:39:30.986 --> 01:39:38.051]  I'm just, it's shocking that, and that is an extremely English, old English face.
[01:39:38.051 --> 01:39:39.952]  And so this is shocking.
[01:39:39.952 --> 01:39:41.473]  This is, I mean, I'm not kidding.
[01:39:41.473 --> 01:39:43.955]  If you're a TV viewer, does he not look like Jimmy Savile?
[01:39:45.450 --> 01:39:46.170]  I think he does.
[01:39:46.170 --> 01:39:50.832]  Yeah, now that you pull the picture up, the facial structure is the same.
[01:39:50.832 --> 01:39:52.853]  That's funny.
[01:39:52.853 --> 01:39:56.734]  Yeah, so Jimmy Savelle was obsessed with dead bodies.
[01:39:56.734 --> 01:40:00.435]  That is super ironic.
[01:40:00.435 --> 01:40:04.697]  I'm just saying, you know, just saying.
[01:40:04.697 --> 01:40:10.539]  How do we know that they didn't actually take his brain out and put it into a new clone body?
[01:40:10.539 --> 01:40:13.180]  Maybe it's a reincarnation.
[01:40:13.180 --> 01:40:13.440]  Yeah.
[01:40:14.804 --> 01:40:17.266]  I'm being sarcastic.
[01:40:17.266 --> 01:40:19.908]  Logan Paul does not look like a child molester.
[01:40:19.908 --> 01:40:23.530]  Brian Stelter looks like one.
[01:40:23.530 --> 01:40:24.831]  There you go.
[01:40:24.831 --> 01:40:26.292]  Imagine that coming at your kids.
[01:40:26.292 --> 01:40:28.033]  Good God.
[01:40:28.033 --> 01:40:32.136]  That is the face, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:40:32.136 --> 01:40:33.677]  Man, get him off the screen right now.
[01:40:33.677 --> 01:40:34.397]  Sorry.
[01:40:34.397 --> 01:40:36.899]  Hey, I don't mean to be mean like that, but I'm telling you.
[01:40:36.899 --> 01:40:37.960]  Brian Stelter is
[01:40:40.896 --> 01:40:43.537]  Welcome to this episode of Impaulsive, the number one podcast in the
[01:41:00.593 --> 01:41:01.654]  I took two shots last night.
[01:41:01.654 --> 01:41:02.534]  I think I'm hungover.
[01:41:02.534 --> 01:41:03.894]  Yeah, this is a first.
[01:41:03.894 --> 01:41:05.395]  So, he went out last night.
[01:41:05.395 --> 01:41:07.116]  He drank a little bit.
[01:41:07.116 --> 01:41:07.976]  I was asleep by 9.32 p.m.
[01:41:07.976 --> 01:41:10.157]  These are college guys.
[01:41:10.157 --> 01:41:11.057]  Wow.
[01:41:11.057 --> 01:41:13.618]  That learn how to act cool in front of little kids.
[01:41:13.618 --> 01:41:15.279]  It's quite an angle.
[01:41:15.279 --> 01:41:18.400]  That was actually Jimmy Savelle's specialty.
[01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:19.500]  It's kids entertainment.
[01:41:23.982 --> 01:41:30.807]  If you're not subscribed, make sure to subscribe for every list of podcasts, iTunes, YouTube, Spotify.
[01:41:30.807 --> 01:41:32.428]  Today is going to get juicy.
[01:41:32.428 --> 01:41:36.271]  Today is going to get very, very juicy.
[01:41:36.271 --> 01:41:38.773]  As you can see, the guest is sitting to my right.
[01:41:38.773 --> 01:41:41.235]  She's already on the set, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:41:41.795 --> 01:41:42.636]  Want to introduce her.
[01:41:42.636 --> 01:41:45.501]  She's a very controversial guest.
[01:41:45.501 --> 01:41:47.985]  Arguably more than myself.
[01:41:47.985 --> 01:41:49.026]  Whoa.
[01:41:49.026 --> 01:41:50.789]  That's a bold statement.
[01:41:50.789 --> 01:41:53.173]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Portia on the main stage.
[01:41:53.173 --> 01:41:53.934]  The way he's introducing her.
[01:41:53.934 --> 01:41:56.117]  The Kent State gun girl, Caitlin Bennett.
[01:41:56.994 --> 01:41:58.755]  Yay!
[01:41:58.755 --> 01:42:00.576]  I don't get a clap.
[01:42:00.576 --> 01:42:01.716]  Jeb Bush, please clap.
[01:42:01.716 --> 01:42:05.338]  My daughter literally has a Supreme sticker on her laptop like this other guy.
[01:42:05.338 --> 01:42:06.459]  In a lot of ways.
[01:42:06.459 --> 01:42:07.699]  This is actually frightening.
[01:42:07.699 --> 01:42:08.400]  How are you, Caitlyn?
[01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:08.980]  I am good.
[01:42:08.980 --> 01:42:10.300]  I am great.
[01:42:10.300 --> 01:42:10.561]  Are you?
[01:42:10.561 --> 01:42:11.961]  Because you seem tense.
[01:42:11.961 --> 01:42:12.882]  I am nervous.
[01:42:12.882 --> 01:42:13.522]  I am nervous.
[01:42:13.522 --> 01:42:13.922]  Wait a minute.
[01:42:13.922 --> 01:42:15.163]  She's got one of those stickers, too.
[01:42:16.513 --> 01:42:18.414]  Millions of people will probably see this.
[01:42:18.414 --> 01:42:21.516]  Millions of people already see you.
[01:42:21.516 --> 01:42:23.478]  Before we get started, you said you were tired.
[01:42:23.478 --> 01:42:24.619]  Yeah, I'm exhausted.
[01:42:24.619 --> 01:42:25.900]  Okay, is anybody else tired?
[01:42:25.900 --> 01:42:27.501]  I feel pretty good.
[01:42:27.501 --> 01:42:27.781]  I'm up.
[01:42:27.781 --> 01:42:28.982]  I don't like where this is going.
[01:42:29.833 --> 01:42:31.014]  Something for all of you.
[01:42:31.014 --> 01:42:33.315]  Can you be careful when you reach in your pockets like that?
[01:42:33.315 --> 01:42:34.056]  No.
[01:42:34.056 --> 01:42:34.676]  That would be great.
[01:42:34.676 --> 01:42:35.177]  Thanks.
[01:42:35.177 --> 01:42:36.458]  This is Turbo Force.
[01:42:36.458 --> 01:42:36.938]  Oh my god.
[01:42:36.938 --> 01:42:38.939]  Are you unplugging our whole fucking show?
[01:42:38.939 --> 01:42:39.440]  No!
[01:42:39.440 --> 01:42:40.460]  Watch.
[01:42:40.460 --> 01:42:43.062]  I'm going to need you to write a check right now.
[01:42:43.062 --> 01:42:44.603]  Energy drink you will ever get.
[01:42:44.603 --> 01:42:45.884]  It's the Essence... No, no.
[01:42:45.884 --> 01:42:47.285]  She's your guest, buddy.
[01:42:47.285 --> 01:42:49.046]  We're going to come back with this.
[01:42:49.046 --> 01:42:49.506]  They freak out.
[01:42:49.506 --> 01:42:52.629]  You know, as soon as somebody goes on Fox News, they plug their book.
[01:42:52.629 --> 01:42:53.549]  You know how that works, bro?
[01:42:53.549 --> 01:42:54.770]  It's not a one-way street here.
[01:42:54.770 --> 01:42:56.011]  She had to fly out there, dum-dum.
[01:43:06.658 --> 01:43:15.660]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[01:43:15.660 --> 01:43:25.741]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[01:43:25.741 --> 01:43:34.283]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[01:43:35.103 --> 01:43:36.464]  There's nothing else like it.
[01:43:36.464 --> 01:43:37.604]  You must experience it.
[01:43:37.604 --> 01:43:39.705]  It is a total game-changer.
[01:43:39.705 --> 01:43:44.608]  It comes in easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[01:43:44.608 --> 01:43:46.149]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[01:43:46.149 --> 01:43:47.610]  It lasts 10 hours.
[01:43:47.610 --> 01:43:54.313]  So take a half-pack the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[01:43:54.313 --> 01:43:55.794]  TurboForce at M4sLife.com.
[01:43:57.273 --> 01:44:02.475]  Infowarsstore.com is how you support us, and it's not like we're selling stuff you don't need, you don't want.
[01:44:02.475 --> 01:44:11.039]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[01:44:11.039 --> 01:44:14.021]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[01:44:14.021 --> 01:44:15.761]  How can I solve that problem?
[01:44:15.761 --> 01:44:22.024]  So we have air filters at Infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off.
[01:44:24.125 --> 01:44:29.448]  The Alexa Pure Breeze Groundbreaking Ion Cluster Air Filter Technology.
[01:44:29.448 --> 01:44:32.409]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[01:44:32.409 --> 01:44:36.331]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[01:44:36.331 --> 01:44:40.313]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[01:44:40.313 --> 01:44:42.134]  I've got two in my home.
[01:44:42.134 --> 01:44:48.237]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house.
[01:44:48.237 --> 01:44:49.078]  Don't live

[01:45:58.406 --> 01:46:01.467]  Our grandparents, the great-grandparents, knew they canned food.

[01:47:33.303 --> 01:47:33.863]  Central.
[01:47:33.863 --> 01:47:36.524]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:36.524 --> 01:47:38.425]  It's not just a show.
[01:47:38.425 --> 01:47:40.066]  It's a revolution.
[01:47:40.066 --> 01:47:42.367]  It's a pro-human mindset.
[01:47:42.367 --> 01:47:45.828]  Jacked in the universe of God's consciousness.
[01:47:45.828 --> 01:47:47.729]  It's next level.
[01:47:47.729 --> 01:47:49.650]  The string cheese incident.
[01:48:08.404 --> 01:48:11.266]  Everything we cover here is important, obviously.
[01:48:11.266 --> 01:48:12.307]  All your calls are important.
[01:48:12.307 --> 01:48:15.209]  All our guests.
[01:48:15.209 --> 01:48:23.635]  But today's next two hours are going to be very important.
[01:48:23.635 --> 01:48:29.779]  The reason I blew up when Caitlin Bennett was first on is that I was a little late getting back in the studio from the break and I was fumbling around.
[01:48:31.351 --> 01:48:35.333]  I've been shouting orders back there to them about getting up this video that they were taking down everywhere.
[01:48:35.333 --> 01:48:46.279]  And then I just started thinking about how they publicly have the Defense Department and the CIA trying to ruin my life.
[01:48:46.279 --> 01:48:48.681]  And they have congressional hearings admitting it.
[01:48:48.681 --> 01:48:50.882]  We've aired the clips.
[01:48:50.882 --> 01:48:53.523]  And the average man I know goes, well, I better not get close to you.
[01:48:53.523 --> 01:48:55.744]  What type of coward are you?
[01:48:55.744 --> 01:48:59.146]  Those are criminals in the government doing that, just like the rogue FBI group.
[01:48:59.146 --> 01:49:00.187]  It's like 30 of them.
[01:49:01.581 --> 01:49:04.982]  We're gonna let 30 rogue people in the FBI overthrow the whole country?
[01:49:04.982 --> 01:49:09.124]  We're gonna let a few thousand in the CIA?
[01:49:09.124 --> 01:49:11.725]  And I don't, I'm not defending the CIA.
[01:49:11.725 --> 01:49:16.887]  It's unconstitutional, it's out of control, it needs to be abolished, reformed, whatever.
[01:49:16.887 --> 01:49:21.308]  But most people in the CIA actually are not for the New World Order.
[01:49:21.308 --> 01:49:22.629]  In fact, police!
[01:49:24.269 --> 01:49:32.440]  I was, I kind of got tricked into early on, not thinking police were bad, but thinking the police state was bad, which I was right about, but that's not the police.
[01:49:32.440 --> 01:49:36.025]  We're going to take one minute in a moment.
[01:49:36.025 --> 01:49:40.251]  And then I found out, no, no, it's the cops that are more awake than anybody.
[01:49:40.251 --> 01:49:41.293]  One time they came over to the.
[01:49:42.830 --> 01:49:50.552]  County Convention Center is where I was yelling at him and yelling about this and that and the Sheriff's Department said, why don't you come over across the street to our headquarters?
[01:49:50.552 --> 01:49:58.755]  And I get over there, it's John Birch magazines everywhere and Oklahoma City and job videos and everything and they go, look Alex, we know more of this than you do.
[01:49:58.755 --> 01:49:59.155]  Stop it!
[01:50:00.571 --> 01:50:03.234]  Why do you think the press is always demonizing us?
[01:50:03.234 --> 01:50:09.919]  You know, if we do something wrong, we're not perfect, but they're doing it because they want to federalize us.
[01:50:09.919 --> 01:50:11.741]  And the feds are run by the UN.
[01:50:11.741 --> 01:50:16.585]  And I'm hearing all this like 22 years ago and I'm like, and then later it all comes out and it's true.
[01:50:16.585 --> 01:50:19.887]  The police aren't learning about the UN takeover from me, I learned about it from them.
[01:50:19.887 --> 01:50:23.510]  And it doesn't mean the police are perfect.
[01:50:23.510 --> 01:50:27.654]  There's some horrible boss hog jurisdictions, there's some bad cops out there, we all know that.
[01:50:27.654 --> 01:50:28.975]  There's bad school teachers, whatever.
[01:50:33.157 --> 01:50:48.606]  We've come a long way, but this information about the Southern Poverty Law Center, ADL, Media Matters, Hope Not Hate is run by the same group in England.
[01:50:48.606 --> 01:50:54.830]  They literally interface with top TV producers at BBC, CNN, you name it, New York Times.
[01:50:54.830 --> 01:50:57.211]  We have undercover video from Project Veritas.
[01:50:57.211 --> 01:50:58.372]  They'll put all these videos together.
[01:51:00.675 --> 01:51:05.618]  And they go out and they pay people to lie about you, and they try to put you in prison!
[01:51:05.618 --> 01:51:16.326]  And then handbooks came out last year, where intelligence agencies are paying private groups to then demonize you, sue you, to make you look guilty, and then you just, quote, commit suicide.
[01:51:16.326 --> 01:51:18.287]  They kill you.
[01:51:18.287 --> 01:51:19.988]  But first they shut you up.
[01:51:19.988 --> 01:51:23.791]  People have to understand, folks, this isn't just demonize people.
[01:51:24.858 --> 01:51:29.102]  Deplatform them, take them off air, sue them, then it's kill them.
[01:51:29.102 --> 01:51:30.203]  Put them in prison.
[01:51:30.203 --> 01:51:31.784]  Tommy Robinson.
[01:51:31.784 --> 01:51:33.525]  Roger Stone.
[01:51:33.525 --> 01:51:36.008]  Myself.
[01:51:36.008 --> 01:51:38.970]  So, I'm not up here bitching, oh gosh, they're about to get me!
[01:51:38.970 --> 01:51:41.993]  I'm fighting them because they're bad.
[01:51:41.993 --> 01:51:44.835]  I'm risking my life because somebody's got to do it.
[01:51:44.835 --> 01:51:46.557]  But this shouldn't be hard.
[01:51:46.557 --> 01:51:50.180]  The instinct of Americans has become, let's kiss their ash.
[01:51:53.114 --> 01:51:57.632]  They put out these truth charts where AP is the most trusted, InfoWars is the most untrusted.
[01:52:01.667 --> 01:52:03.328]  Absolute ridiculous bull.
[01:52:03.328 --> 01:52:04.909]  Going back to Kaitlin Bennett.
[01:52:04.909 --> 01:52:09.312]  Kaitlin, we hit that break and I'm going to finish up the Logan Paul thing.
[01:52:09.312 --> 01:52:10.593]  It's kind of a plug for Turbo Force.
[01:52:10.593 --> 01:52:12.694]  We need to fund the operation.
[01:52:12.694 --> 01:52:15.196]  And then later they attacked me with that clip too.
[01:52:15.196 --> 01:52:22.261]  But this is important because then we'll be able to reach young girls mainly that watch these guys.
[01:52:22.261 --> 01:52:28.625]  You just got out of college, but why do you think young 10 to 14 year old girls think a show like this is so cool?
[01:52:30.359 --> 01:52:33.040]  I think it's because Logan's funny.
[01:52:33.040 --> 01:52:36.102]  I think it's because they're all just goofy.
[01:52:36.102 --> 01:52:41.765]  I mean, his new little episodes are him with a midget and it's his best friend.
[01:52:41.765 --> 01:52:42.745]  So it's funny.
[01:52:42.745 --> 01:52:43.486]  It's goofy.
[01:52:43.486 --> 01:52:47.288]  I don't know if you watch Cartoon Network, but the shows they have on now are just
[01:52:47.848 --> 01:52:49.450]  Not shows that I used to watch.
[01:52:49.450 --> 01:52:51.331]  I know not shows that my mom used to watch.
[01:52:51.331 --> 01:52:57.136]  So the humor in little kids today has completely shifted into something that I don't really understand either.
[01:52:57.136 --> 01:52:58.957]  I have a 13-year-old sister.
[01:52:58.957 --> 01:53:04.302]  She likes all kinds of crazy stuff that I would never imagine liking when I was 10 or 13.
[01:53:04.302 --> 01:53:05.863]  So I think it's that.
[01:53:05.863 --> 01:53:09.046]  I think that Logan, you know, it's just
[01:53:09.679 --> 01:53:10.780]  He's always been around.
[01:53:10.780 --> 01:53:13.141]  He used to be a Viner, and then Vine went away.
[01:53:13.141 --> 01:53:15.783]  And, uh, I mean, he's from Cleveland.
[01:53:15.783 --> 01:53:28.170]  He grew up in Cleveland, where I'm from, so a lot of people around me know exactly who he is, how he is, and, uh, they grew up with him, so... So, were they actually scared of you, a woman that owns a gun, or was that an act?
[01:53:29.255 --> 01:53:30.536]  I don't think they were scared.
[01:53:30.536 --> 01:53:33.317]  I think that they thought that I would cower.
[01:53:33.317 --> 01:53:40.781]  I think they thought that I would kind of sit back in my chair and just let them come after me and not have anything to back up.
[01:53:40.781 --> 01:53:47.524]  If you guys watch the actual, the whole hour and a half footage, they fact check me time and time again.
[01:53:47.524 --> 01:53:51.866]  And every time they fact check me because they thought I was wrong, I ended up being right.
[01:53:51.866 --> 01:53:54.908]  And afterwards they were like, you know, you're very poised.
[01:53:55.308 --> 01:53:56.148]  You're very calm.
[01:53:56.148 --> 01:54:03.852]  You had all of us coming after you about your opinions and the way you do things, and you remained there, calm and smiling, and you didn't get heated once.
[01:54:03.852 --> 01:54:10.555]  And I'm like, you know, the arguments that they threw at me were the same arguments I've been hearing for years, so I knew how to debunk them.
[01:54:10.555 --> 01:54:12.316]  By the way, I'd love to go on there and be fact-checked.
[01:54:12.316 --> 01:54:16.978]  You're like, 95% of the time the TSA fails.
[01:54:16.978 --> 01:54:18.419]  Well, they've done that study over and over again.
[01:54:18.419 --> 01:54:21.381]  It comes out 90, 98%, and they go, wow.
[01:54:21.381 --> 01:54:23.081]  Wow, even mainstream news says 95% of the TSA fails.
[01:54:25.011 --> 01:54:27.054]  Yeah, because it's an internal checkpoint for the citizenry.
[01:54:27.054 --> 01:54:27.975]  It's not to stop terrorists.
[01:54:27.975 --> 01:54:30.658]  The borders are wide open, at least until Trump got in.
[01:54:30.658 --> 01:54:31.860]  And so, exactly.
[01:54:31.860 --> 01:54:38.088]  Time and time again, they couldn't believe that you were telling them the truth because you work for InfoWars as if we sit here and make stuff up.
[01:54:39.113 --> 01:54:56.382]  Yes, I've been actually accused of making up sex crime statistics because I worked for InfoWars as I was talking about how 4,000 rapes have occurred because of illegal immigrants and the person I told that to did not believe me because they said that InfoWars was making up sex crimes.
[01:54:56.382 --> 01:54:58.443]  So the way that the media and the
[01:55:00.024 --> 01:55:03.046]  Just corporations are turning on InfoWars.
[01:55:03.046 --> 01:55:10.911]  They're brainwashing the public into believing that that InfoWars logo and anyone who associates with it is bad.
[01:55:10.911 --> 01:55:11.352]  They're lying.
[01:55:11.352 --> 01:55:14.234]  That's because they knew it was so effective, they want to destroy it.
[01:55:14.234 --> 01:55:19.097]  InfoWars is just a symbol of Americana, so they can't kill it because it lives on through everybody.
[01:55:19.097 --> 01:55:28.403]  But expanding on that, so you think these guys really believe the stuff they're saying versus just playing along?
[01:55:29.440 --> 01:55:30.881]  Yeah, no, they definitely believed it.
[01:55:30.881 --> 01:55:33.402]  I could tell they're very genuine.
[01:55:33.402 --> 01:55:35.303]  They had their little fact sheet out.
[01:55:35.303 --> 01:55:40.226]  They had their laptops up looking at things that they wanted to kind of bring and spring on me.
[01:55:40.226 --> 01:55:41.767]  They genuinely believe that.
[01:55:41.767 --> 01:55:46.790]  I think that I maybe changed their mind a little bit on something.
[01:55:46.790 --> 01:55:52.493]  They definitely tried to change my mind on how I go about things or how I act in public or how I act when I'm
[01:55:52.993 --> 01:55:55.155]  And doing my interviews or my videos.
[01:55:55.155 --> 01:56:00.819]  But, you know, the difference is that the videos that they make, they don't go out and face death threats.
[01:56:00.819 --> 01:56:04.501]  They don't go out and face people wanting to push them in front of buses.
[01:56:04.501 --> 01:56:05.482]  It's completely different.
[01:56:05.482 --> 01:56:06.643]  I'm exposing people.
[01:56:06.643 --> 01:56:15.329]  I'm exposing a complete entire Democratic Party that wants to get rid of conservatives and put them in concentration camps on campus.
[01:56:15.329 --> 01:56:16.990]  They're going out and playing with midgets.
[01:56:17.330 --> 01:56:17.930]  That's right.
[01:56:17.930 --> 01:56:19.811]  You're on DrugsReport.com.
[01:56:19.811 --> 01:56:21.151]  You're in the real world.
[01:56:21.151 --> 01:56:22.652]  You're in a man's world.
[01:56:22.652 --> 01:56:26.453]  You're a woman in a man's world, and the men are acting like little boys.
[01:56:26.453 --> 01:56:28.654]  And I'm not trying to be mean to Logan Paul and all these people.
[01:56:28.654 --> 01:56:38.718]  It's just, I mean, I did watch about 45 minutes of it this morning, and I was just, it was just like, everything you were saying is like well-known facts.
[01:56:38.718 --> 01:56:40.758]  80% of the women coming up from Latin America get raped.
[01:56:40.758 --> 01:56:42.499]  Not here, in Mexico.
[01:56:42.499 --> 01:56:44.760]  That's Amnesty International, that's the UN admits that.
[01:56:45.942 --> 01:56:48.687]  I tell people that and they go, oh, Alex, you're Mr. Fake News.
[01:56:48.687 --> 01:56:49.508]  You're just saying that.
[01:56:49.508 --> 01:56:55.739]  So they want to inoculate people so that when our listeners say, hey, Infowars.com, they go, oh, I don't listen to that.
[01:56:55.739 --> 01:56:56.160]  Use that.
[01:56:56.160 --> 01:56:58.003]  Say, hey, why do they demonize it?
[01:56:58.829 --> 01:57:00.491]  What is it that you really believe?
[01:57:00.491 --> 01:57:01.712]  What is it you think he really said?
[01:57:01.712 --> 01:57:05.436]  Because I didn't say 99% of what they really said I said.
[01:57:05.436 --> 01:57:06.517]  And that's the key here.
[01:57:06.517 --> 01:57:11.101]  Go, hey, if it's so evil, it's so bad, do you want to hear it for yourself?
[01:57:11.101 --> 01:57:13.184]  Why they're telling you you shouldn't listen to it?
[01:57:13.184 --> 01:57:16.287]  Because, you know, he's the guy that talks about people like Jesse Smollett being fake.
[01:57:17.318 --> 01:57:18.779]  Because a lot of the time this stuff is fake.
[01:57:18.779 --> 01:57:22.320]  Caitlin, I want to come back and get into that university you went to.
[01:57:22.320 --> 01:57:27.482]  I've got the article here and the video is up on DrugsReport.com here today and discuss all that.
[01:57:27.482 --> 01:57:30.343]  But help us finance Caitlin Bennett.
[01:57:30.343 --> 01:57:33.324]  I've got another 20 or so reporters I'd like to hire.
[01:57:33.324 --> 01:57:34.605]  I'd like to be able to fly around.
[01:57:34.605 --> 01:57:36.065]  I'd like to be able to finance.
[01:57:36.065 --> 01:57:39.907]  We cannot do it unless you buy products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:57:39.907 --> 01:57:43.688]  If you want soldiers for truth out there like Caitlin Bennett, InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:57:43.688 --> 01:57:44.748]  A lot of great products.
[01:57:44.748 --> 01:57:45.789]  You're funding your own defense.
[01:57:47.227 --> 01:57:52.992]  You know, the worst part about getting old and I'm still strong at 45 is that I won't be there for my children someday.
[01:57:52.992 --> 01:57:54.453]  So I need to make them strong now.
[01:57:54.453 --> 01:57:56.215]  Now, I can be there for my children.
[01:57:56.215 --> 01:57:58.056]  Now, I can make them strong.
[01:57:58.056 --> 01:57:59.698]  Now, I can instruct them.
[01:57:59.698 --> 01:58:01.419]  Now, I can teach them what I've learned.
[01:58:01.419 --> 01:58:02.400]  But not once I'm gone.
[01:58:02.520 --> 01:58:07.643]  You think in this digital age, your word's gone forever, but now they're even better at getting rid of what you said they were before.
[01:58:07.643 --> 01:58:13.246]  It's so much easier to burn video or text or languages now that we have high-tech book burning, isn't it?
[01:58:13.246 --> 01:58:16.888]  But I have joined my will to the resistance.
[01:58:16.888 --> 01:58:21.851]  I can't be destroyed now, as long as I realize I've done right and as long as the people know the truth.
[01:58:21.851 --> 01:58:28.655]  And you can't be destroyed either, as long as you bind yourself to something and commit to it and go through the fire for it.
[01:58:28.735 --> 01:58:32.517]  There is a magic that then takes place that transcends space and time.
[01:58:32.517 --> 01:58:40.140]  When you commit via word of mouth, or to pray for us, or to spread our articles and videos, that overrides everything the enemy's doing.
[01:58:40.140 --> 01:58:46.743]  So please now, commit to support InfoWars however you can, and realize your provision to InfoWars is your own provision.
[01:58:50.382 --> 01:58:53.465]  At its regular price, it's a little over $3.
[01:58:53.465 --> 01:58:58.350]  When we have it discounted, it's about $2.50 a piece.
[01:58:58.350 --> 01:59:02.334]  Comparable bars are between $5 and $7 a piece at Whole Foods.
[01:59:02.334 --> 01:59:03.736]  This is high-end.
[01:59:03.736 --> 01:59:06.699]  When you get one box, you get them at basically $3.
[01:59:06.699 --> 01:59:11.084]  You get them for $2.50 or so when you get it at the current launch discount.
[01:59:11.684 --> 01:59:20.575]  This took over a year to get the top manufacturer and developer in the country to get it all ready and to have the manufacturing line prepared and to make this.
[01:59:20.575 --> 01:59:23.018]  It's available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:59:23.018 --> 01:59:23.419]  It's simple.
[01:59:23.419 --> 01:59:29.026]  You get the highest quality protein bars in two different flavors and you fund the war against the globalists.
[01:59:29.486 --> 01:59:30.767]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:04.124 --> 02:00:05.384]  The Preacher Man Says.
[02:00:05.384 --> 02:00:07.085]  I've got three daughters.
[02:00:07.085 --> 02:00:08.785]  Fourteen, eleven, and almost two.
[02:00:08.785 --> 02:00:11.546]  And when they grow up, I want them to be like Caitlin Bennett.
[02:00:11.546 --> 02:00:12.866]  Smart, incisive, standing up to bullies.
[02:00:12.866 --> 02:00:14.926]  Knowing how to shoot a gun.
[02:00:33.993 --> 02:00:39.396]  Knowing how to run a trot line, and knowing how to be a mama, and knowing how to be a leader.
[02:00:39.396 --> 02:00:41.757]  And that's what the West has always done.
[02:00:41.757 --> 02:00:44.119]  We're the place that holds women up on a pedestal.
[02:00:44.119 --> 02:00:48.561]  And because the psychopaths know we have a conscience, they tell us all day that we're bad to women.
[02:00:48.561 --> 02:00:51.303]  But it's the West that puts women on a pedestal where they deserve to be.
[02:00:51.303 --> 02:00:56.145]  I can plow a field.
[02:00:56.145 --> 02:00:58.307]  All day long.
[02:01:00.205 --> 02:01:04.328]  But then you go and you look at those people, you must interview 50 of them.
[02:01:04.328 --> 02:01:09.491]  Two of them knew that Trump was the 45th president.
[02:01:09.491 --> 02:01:12.232]  But they all knew he was a Nazi!
[02:01:12.232 --> 02:01:16.595]  And Bill Maher talks about the left or the smart people.
[02:01:16.595 --> 02:01:17.736]  How they're the ones that are educated.
[02:01:17.736 --> 02:01:21.358]  How they're the ones that go and get all those educations.
[02:01:21.358 --> 02:01:25.220]  And I'm not knocking you to go get them, but statistically 90% of degrees are worthless.
[02:01:27.165 --> 02:01:28.467]  Caitlin, we love what you're doing.
[02:01:28.467 --> 02:01:34.454]  You know, we've been talking for six months with you and Millie Weaver, but she just had another baby, which is great.
[02:01:35.457 --> 02:01:40.059]  But that's where there's that glass ceiling, as women tend to have babies, which is great, which is the most important thing.
[02:01:40.059 --> 02:01:41.980]  Any mother knows that.
[02:01:41.980 --> 02:01:44.321]  So she's out of commission for a little while, but you can't hold her down.
[02:01:44.321 --> 02:01:48.083]  She was doing interviews until the day before she had the baby.
[02:01:48.083 --> 02:01:51.244]  So a second baby, that's great, with her and Gavin.
[02:01:51.244 --> 02:01:56.007]  But I would like to get you guys, I want to do a roundtable show, because it's hard to get reporters on the road a lot.
[02:01:56.007 --> 02:02:00.289]  We'll do it all the time, but I want to have Millie, you, and I think, I don't want to rip off Fox, but it's a good idea.
[02:02:01.269 --> 02:02:25.289]  I think you have like 10 women and so the women can rotate in and out do the show a few days a week do it five days a week if you want but but have women and men rotating out and then somebody I think like Harrison Smith or something who traffic cops and just goes in and out of the brakes queues up the clips and kind of produces the show and we have a female producer as well just as the producers a lot of them are women around here we don't think about
[02:02:25.589 --> 02:02:27.811]  As a man, a woman, we should think about who does the best job.
[02:02:27.811 --> 02:02:33.317]  But I think we should try to launch that nighttime show soon that we've been talking about for, I guess, almost a year.
[02:02:33.317 --> 02:02:37.742]  I know Millie got frustrated that we didn't launch that yet just because we didn't have the crew hired yet.
[02:02:37.742 --> 02:02:39.483]  We've gotten that done.
[02:02:39.483 --> 02:02:41.145]  We've been a little bit busy fighting the globalists.
[02:02:41.145 --> 02:02:43.648]  But I just want to salute you and the great work you're doing.
[02:02:43.648 --> 02:02:44.609]  What's coming next?
[02:02:46.500 --> 02:02:49.464]  Um, honestly, I have no clue.
[02:02:49.464 --> 02:02:53.990]  The undercover at the UCLA thing kind of just happened out of nowhere.
[02:02:53.990 --> 02:03:01.019]  I bought everything the day before we flew out to California because I said, let's do another undercover thing.
[02:03:01.019 --> 02:03:02.601]  Let's get them to sign a crazy petition.
[02:03:03.121 --> 02:03:09.724]  And then my fiance Justin was like, let's get them to sign a petition to put Trump supporters in concentration camps.
[02:03:09.724 --> 02:03:15.027]  And then I wanted to focus on abortion because I feel like that's what I'm most passionate about right now.
[02:03:15.027 --> 02:03:23.311]  So I did one for the concentration camp, and then I did one for students to support free late-term abortions on campus.
[02:03:23.311 --> 02:03:26.913]  And I only got one person to say, no, I don't support that.
[02:03:26.913 --> 02:03:29.374]  Everybody else was all down for it.
[02:03:29.654 --> 02:03:31.576]  It's all because you were wearing a rainbow outfit.
[02:03:31.576 --> 02:03:34.600]  And tell folks the name of your gnome diploma.
[02:03:34.600 --> 02:03:40.687]  So my undercover name is Jenna Taley.
[02:03:40.687 --> 02:03:44.251]  So I love how you're letting them know they were conscious right out front.
[02:03:44.251 --> 02:03:45.913]  Oh hi, I'm Jenna Taley.
[02:03:45.913 --> 02:03:48.696]  Will you sign my petition to put conservatives in concentration camps?
[02:03:49.724 --> 02:03:50.485]  And they didn't get it.
[02:03:50.485 --> 02:03:52.166]  They just, they loved it.
[02:03:52.166 --> 02:03:56.350]  The first girl I interacted with was a girl that was on student government.
[02:03:56.350 --> 02:03:58.692]  She was a fourth year, she was a senior.
[02:03:58.692 --> 02:04:01.173]  And she was like, oh, I love, I didn't have to say anything.
[02:04:01.173 --> 02:04:04.376]  She came up to me, she was like, I love this, I'm queer.
[02:04:04.376 --> 02:04:09.120]  And I'm like, great, here we are with identity politics, but you're the perfect person that would support this.
[02:04:09.560 --> 02:04:20.024]  Come to find out, she was giving me tips and tricks on how to hide that I wanted to target conservatives and Trump supporters and put it under the name of diversity training.
[02:04:20.024 --> 02:04:23.526]  She wanted me to, she flat out said, yes, hide what you're trying to do.
[02:04:24.344 --> 02:04:29.247]  Disguise it under this term, and then the administration will support you.
[02:04:29.247 --> 02:04:30.168]  Caitlin, you're awesome.
[02:04:30.168 --> 02:04:31.769]  Anybody can search your name for now.
[02:04:31.769 --> 02:04:32.889]  I hope you don't get unpersoned.
[02:04:32.889 --> 02:04:37.192]  You're on Twitter, you're on Facebook, you're on YouTube, and you're at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[02:04:37.192 --> 02:04:40.674]  We salute you, and we thank you, and we'll talk to you again very soon.
[02:04:40.674 --> 02:04:41.494]  Thank you so much.
[02:04:41.494 --> 02:04:42.615]  She's awesome.
[02:04:42.615 --> 02:04:43.356]  All right.
[02:04:43.356 --> 02:04:44.396]  Hope for the future.
[02:04:44.396 --> 02:04:48.078]  When we come back, this is the big enchilada, folks.
[02:04:48.078 --> 02:04:49.459]  This could bring them down.
[02:04:49.459 --> 02:04:53.602]  Another Veritas-level infiltration of the Intelligence Crime Syndicate.
[02:05:05.563 --> 02:05:14.567]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[02:05:14.567 --> 02:05:24.650]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[02:05:24.650 --> 02:05:33.174]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[02:05:34.014 --> 02:05:35.355]  There's nothing else like it.
[02:05:35.355 --> 02:05:36.515]  You must experience it.
[02:05:36.515 --> 02:05:38.456]  It is a total game-changer.
[02:05:38.456 --> 02:05:43.519]  And it comes in easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[02:05:43.519 --> 02:05:45.040]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[02:05:45.040 --> 02:05:46.521]  It lasts 10 hours.
[02:05:46.521 --> 02:05:53.204]  So take a half-pack the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[02:05:53.204 --> 02:05:54.705]  TurboForce at m4slive.com.
[02:06:08.391 --> 02:06:15.168]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show, the most demonized, the most censored, the most attacked broadcast in the world.
[02:06:16.713 --> 02:06:18.615]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[02:06:18.615 --> 02:06:36.931]  And joining us exclusively is a living folk hero, Tommy Robinson from jolly old England, political prisoner, the man that first exposed giant Muslim child kidnapping sex rings and murder 13 years ago, imprisoned repeatedly for documenting it and exposing it.
[02:06:36.931 --> 02:06:39.814]  Now the worldwide phenomenon is mainstream news.
[02:06:39.814 --> 02:06:41.776]  Thousands have been convicted in Europe.
[02:06:42.497 --> 02:06:46.423]  And in the UK, but now it's coming here.
[02:06:46.423 --> 02:06:47.825]  But he made a documentary!
[02:06:48.900 --> 02:06:57.243]  Undercover exposing the incredible MI5, MI6 interface with so-called leftist NGOs.
[02:06:57.243 --> 02:07:04.806]  And suddenly, a day after it was released and got millions of views, it was taken off Facebook, it was taken off many other platforms.
[02:07:04.806 --> 02:07:15.811]  So this story is about censorship, about infiltration, about criminal espionage that makes the COINTELPRO of the FBI in the 60s and 70s and 80s look tame in comparison.
[02:07:16.391 --> 02:07:33.439]  So we're going to play large excerpts of this censored documentary, but joining us for this segment and the next is Tommy Robinson to tell us about the film, where they can see it, where they can find it, and clips of it are coming up, and then how it's just a continuation with the censorship all coordinated the day after it went viral.
[02:07:33.439 --> 02:07:34.459]  Tommy, thanks for joining us.
[02:07:34.459 --> 02:07:37.740]  No, thanks for having me on Alex.
[02:07:37.740 --> 02:07:43.283]  Please tell us about the film, the name of it, it's linked up on Infowars.com, and what it covers.
[02:07:44.363 --> 02:07:45.703]  It's called Panodrama.
[02:07:45.703 --> 02:07:51.925]  That's the name taken from the actual... The BBC have their flagship investigative journalist program.
[02:07:51.925 --> 02:07:53.506]  It's called Panorama.
[02:07:53.506 --> 02:07:55.346]  Now, they were targeting me.
[02:07:55.346 --> 02:08:09.371]  Now, when I come out of prison, my PayPal was removed, my Twitter had been removed, I'd been unlawfully put in prison, and I was not aware to the levels or the sinister levels that they were about to go to, to try to discredit me to my entire country.
[02:08:10.339 --> 02:08:22.462]  When I found out that they were blackmailing people, I had ex-employees saying they'd been intimidated, blackmailed, they'd used leverage and information they had on those employees to threaten them into helping them bring me down.
[02:08:22.462 --> 02:08:29.503]  When that all became apparent, I then worked with another ex-employee to go undercover onto Panorama.
[02:08:29.503 --> 02:08:36.045]  She wore undercover cameras which got the lead investigative journalist for Panorama saying on camera,
[02:08:36.645 --> 02:08:42.167]  He would clip footage so it fitted the narrative of me being a dominant male.
[02:08:42.167 --> 02:08:49.811]  He would make it an innocent argument that we said we had on Dictaphone about a demonstration.
[02:08:49.811 --> 02:08:55.213]  He said on camera, I will make this into a sexual thing against Tommy Robinson.
[02:08:56.132 --> 02:08:58.613]  That's what he clearly said.
[02:08:58.613 --> 02:09:13.261]  And there was so much more in undercover footage which proved to the world the BBC work with an organisation called Hope Not Hate, who work hand in hand with the entire mainstream media.
[02:09:13.261 --> 02:09:19.824]  CNN, the BBC, The Guardian, The Independent, Hope Not Hate are working with them.
[02:09:19.824 --> 02:09:21.765]  In fact, the main man from Hope Not Hate,
[02:09:22.265 --> 02:09:29.875]  He actually sat on a documentary previously with Panorama as a director of it.
[02:09:29.875 --> 02:09:31.097]  And so I proved
[02:09:31.764 --> 02:09:42.052]  Categorically, with evidence and with undercover footage, that the BBC were creating and inventing news in order to destroy and ruin me.
[02:09:42.052 --> 02:09:48.537]  And they were doing that in conjunction with a third party who are George Soros-funded, anti-Glober.
[02:09:48.537 --> 02:09:52.600]  They attack anyone who speaks out against immigration or Islam.
[02:09:52.600 --> 02:09:59.806]  And my documentary went out 24 hours ago, it had one and a half million views, and today I've been deleted from the internet.
[02:10:00.629 --> 02:10:13.439]  And everyone who shared that documentary with major profiles, from Raheem Kassam, to Brian of London in Israel, to UKIP, leading UKIP figures, have all been deleted today.
[02:10:13.439 --> 02:10:23.788]  Simply because, and I urge any American who watches this documentary, you can find it on my YouTube channel, Tommy Robinson, I urge anyone who watches this, this is the proof
[02:10:24.554 --> 02:10:25.635]  It's what we all knew.
[02:10:25.635 --> 02:10:27.558]  We know what the mainstream media are.
[02:10:27.558 --> 02:10:28.759]  But this proves it.
[02:10:28.759 --> 02:10:43.976]  With undercover recordings that prove their contempt for all of us and their willingness to discredit and change and clip and edit and lie to the entire world in order to destroy someone who's going against their narrative.
[02:10:45.356 --> 02:11:05.892]  Well, it came out in the British newspapers, as you know, about a month ago, Zero Heads reported on it here, InfoWars.com reported on it, Tommy, that MI5, MI6, and then the German intelligence are interfacing and paying journalists to put out fake news, to infiltrate nationalists and patriot groups, to target you, to target myself, and so these are...
[02:11:06.673 --> 02:11:07.073]  I think?
[02:11:25.686 --> 02:11:28.448]  Well, in fact, what you had with my former employees was hope, not hate.
[02:11:46.917 --> 02:11:53.061]  who work with the government, who work with the Obama administration, who are advisors to counter-terrorism.
[02:11:53.061 --> 02:11:57.303]  They actually sat my former employees down and said, we now advise counter-terrorism.
[02:11:57.303 --> 02:12:01.106]  Theresa May has just given permission for counter-terrorism to tackle the far right.
[02:12:01.106 --> 02:12:03.907]  We will put you in prison.
[02:12:03.907 --> 02:12:06.189]  And all of this I have on tape.
[02:12:06.189 --> 02:12:08.090]  All of this is recorded.
[02:12:08.090 --> 02:12:15.875]  All of these allegations, plus far more worse ones, is all on an hour-long feature-length documentary and film, which when this has gone out,
[02:12:16.576 --> 02:12:17.676]  They haven't known what to do.
[02:12:17.676 --> 02:12:19.717]  For years, they've tried to silence me.
[02:12:19.717 --> 02:12:21.498]  For years, they've put me in prison.
[02:12:21.498 --> 02:12:26.080]  For years, Twitter, PayPal, any ability for people to support me has been taken away.
[02:12:26.080 --> 02:12:31.522]  And then now, their final punch was going to be Panorama.
[02:12:31.522 --> 02:12:37.844]  The reason they were using Panorama is Panorama is the most respected BBC broadcast in the world.
[02:12:37.844 --> 02:12:40.265]  What Panorama says is the truth.
[02:12:40.265 --> 02:12:42.066]  They are known for finding the truth.
[02:12:42.606 --> 02:12:51.711]  By having Panorama destroy me with false allegations which are made up against women, would discredit me to the nation.
[02:12:51.711 --> 02:12:59.075]  When that hasn't worked because I've gone undercover and exposed it, they've simply deleted me the next day from the internet.
[02:12:59.075 --> 02:13:02.777]  And again, not injecting InfoWars into this, we're part of the story.
[02:13:02.777 --> 02:13:05.478]  We have the exact same operations happening.
[02:13:05.478 --> 02:13:08.680]  They have NPR spending months, where I grew up in Dallas,
[02:13:09.794 --> 02:13:13.678]  And I thought they'd have some interesting stories actually going through my yearbook and calling everyone.
[02:13:13.678 --> 02:13:20.645]  No, they called me with totally made up stories that I was a bully beating up innocent people.
[02:13:20.645 --> 02:13:25.990]  And then the school tied me up and took me out in the forest and knocked my teeth out.
[02:13:25.990 --> 02:13:27.832]  I've never had my teeth knocked out.
[02:13:27.832 --> 02:13:29.854]  And it was whole cloth not true.
[02:13:30.795 --> 02:13:43.965]  I mean, so this is the level, and I know they have private investigators trying to find women, offering people money, paying people, the Daily Mail to tell just insane total lies.
[02:13:43.965 --> 02:13:50.069]  This is their move on nationalists and patriots that stand up to their criminal activity.
[02:13:50.069 --> 02:13:51.330]  It's happening across the world.
[02:13:51.330 --> 02:13:53.672]  That's why I said I sat back and watched when it happened to you, Alex.
[02:13:53.672 --> 02:13:54.773]  Then it happened to Gavin McGuinness.
[02:13:54.773 --> 02:13:55.853]  It's happened to Milo.
[02:13:55.853 --> 02:13:57.815]  It's happening to us all.
[02:13:57.815 --> 02:13:59.476]  And the thing is, I knew this was coming.
[02:14:00.295 --> 02:14:01.619]  I knew it was coming.
[02:14:01.619 --> 02:14:06.456]  But even today, people who have put up I am Tommy Robinson, they've been warned and removed.
[02:14:07.088 --> 02:14:15.331]  The censorship is, and to be so blatant, for everyone who watched that documentary in the last 24 hours, a million and a half people, the outrage was there.
[02:14:15.331 --> 02:14:20.173]  People were outraged that the BBC, the licence fee, we pay for that.
[02:14:20.173 --> 02:14:31.578]  The public broadcast was working with Hope Not Hate, a far-left extremist organisation funded by George Soros, are working hand in hand to manufacture
[02:14:31.638 --> 02:14:34.441]  Thatcher, noobs, to lie.
[02:14:34.441 --> 02:14:46.416]  And exactly as you just said, one ex-female employee of mine is on camera saying she had to argue with them not to run full stories about sexual stories to do with me.
[02:14:47.190 --> 02:14:48.950]  That's how deep this was.
[02:14:48.950 --> 02:14:52.131]  And they know if they throw enough mud, it sticks.
[02:14:52.131 --> 02:15:04.094]  Tommy, I talked to people that were on the phone, known journalists who want to go public, about individuals on the phone with the lawyers, with one of the people that made stuff up about me in the newspaper, saying, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:15:04.094 --> 02:15:06.295]  People don't care if you got fired wrongfully.
[02:15:06.295 --> 02:15:07.575]  They want sex.
[02:15:07.575 --> 02:15:09.916]  Tell us he's tried to have sex with you because you're a man.
[02:15:12.790 --> 02:15:18.716]  It's not John Ronson that did that, it was other folks, but it's just getting insane.
[02:15:18.716 --> 02:15:21.318]  What they've done with that girl, was he ever in your bedroom?
[02:15:21.318 --> 02:15:24.821]  She said, yeah, of course he was in my bedroom at some point.
[02:15:24.821 --> 02:15:29.045]  And then said, okay, well, we've gone back through footage and then he jokingly videos your bum.
[02:15:29.045 --> 02:15:32.629]  And then they put all these things together and they're trying to run a story on it.
[02:15:32.629 --> 02:15:36.032]  And she's saying you can't run that story, but they're fully arguing with those people.
[02:15:36.152 --> 02:15:42.116]  Let's be clear, you know about this because of good people inside the system being whistleblowers, and that's the Achilles heel of the globalists.
[02:15:42.116 --> 02:15:43.537]  They can't censor us all.
[02:15:43.537 --> 02:15:47.400]  Tommy Robinson with the bombshell film, Panorama.
[02:15:47.400 --> 02:15:52.764]  When we come back on the other side, then we're gonna play the censored film here for you.
[02:15:52.764 --> 02:15:54.865]  They haven't shut down Infowars yet.
[02:15:54.865 --> 02:15:55.386]  Not yet!
[02:15:55.386 --> 02:16:01.330]  We pledge allegiance to one flag, and that flag is the American flag.
[02:16:01.983 --> 02:16:06.687]  Did you know the official national American flag has never been manufactured for retail stores?
[02:16:06.687 --> 02:16:08.990]  The one that Americans fought and died for.
[02:16:08.990 --> 02:16:11.792]  The one symbol that represents our Constitution.
[02:16:11.792 --> 02:16:15.216]  Now you can be a part of this great movement that's never been seen before.
[02:16:15.216 --> 02:16:17.538]  Together we'll recapture America.

[02:17:00.220 --> 02:17:05.302]  I was 35 with two beautiful children when my life and addiction started to spiral out of control.
[02:17:05.302 --> 02:17:12.484]  After my divorce, I went into a depression cycle and started drinking more often and using prescription drugs.
[02:17:12.484 --> 02:17:17.026]  After my second DWI and arrest, my ex-husband threatened to take our children away from me.
[02:17:17.623 --> 02:17:21.265]  I was 17 when I became addicted to heroin and meth.
[02:17:21.265 --> 02:17:24.387]  I thought I could quit on my own, but I couldn't.
[02:17:24.387 --> 02:17:27.008]  It hit me when I was arrested.
[02:17:27.008 --> 02:17:28.509]  Get sober now.

[02:17:43.818 --> 02:17:46.279]  During the falls, they'd have it during the winter.
[02:18:02.467 --> 02:18:05.431]  And that's what I'm talking about at InfoWarsTour.com.

[02:18:56.132 --> 02:19:04.515]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to the park or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[02:19:04.515 --> 02:19:05.976]  Believe me, I know.
[02:19:05.976 --> 02:19:10.278]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[02:19:10.278 --> 02:19:13.759]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com.
[02:19:14.239 --> 02:19:15.921]  I still have that energy.
[02:19:15.921 --> 02:19:36.097]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[02:19:36.577 --> 02:19:40.339]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.

[02:19:59.246 --> 02:20:01.907]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:08.397 --> 02:20:11.018]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:20:11.018 --> 02:20:12.719]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:20:12.719 --> 02:20:19.322]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:20:19.322 --> 02:20:24.764]  Wired Magazine cover story months ago.
[02:20:24.764 --> 02:20:27.405]  He who will not be named.
[02:20:27.405 --> 02:20:29.787]  Saying I'm as evil as Voldemort.
[02:20:29.787 --> 02:20:31.967]  From the Harry Potter series I'm the Devil.
[02:20:31.967 --> 02:20:32.848]  Leningradian headline.
[02:20:33.923 --> 02:20:36.684]  Alex Jones is going to destroy the world.
[02:20:36.684 --> 02:20:39.745]  He's the most evil person on earth.
[02:20:39.745 --> 02:20:43.566]  And it's an image of me being drug into the dark by a black hand.
[02:20:43.566 --> 02:20:50.629]  Well, Tommy Robinson is put in solitary confinement where the Muslims can shove feces under the door at him and where he lost 30-something pounds.
[02:20:53.345 --> 02:20:56.189]  That's what they do, and they're coming for everybody.
[02:20:56.189 --> 02:20:57.370]  But here's the good news.
[02:20:57.370 --> 02:21:01.335]  What they've done is so criminal, so over-the-top, so huge, that was what I've told everybody.
[02:21:01.335 --> 02:21:06.001]  Use Project Veritas tactics, tactics we've used way back to Bohemian Grove.
[02:21:06.001 --> 02:21:09.666]  You infiltrate any leftist group, they will be pedophiles.
[02:21:10.387 --> 02:21:12.869]  They will be devil worshippers.
[02:21:12.869 --> 02:21:14.771]  They will be just total criminals.
[02:21:14.771 --> 02:21:15.812]  You will not believe.
[02:21:15.812 --> 02:21:17.714]  You don't have to do any investigation.
[02:21:17.714 --> 02:21:25.400]  You just pose like you're with them, and if you act like you're a criminal like them, they will just open the doors up and you will just be blown away.
[02:21:26.141 --> 02:21:29.282]  This is a criminal group worldwide we're fighting.
[02:21:29.282 --> 02:21:30.683]  This is a spiritual battle.
[02:21:30.683 --> 02:21:34.224]  Tommy Robinson, we're going to air the film coming up in the next few segments.
[02:21:34.224 --> 02:21:40.246]  I know you've got to go and take care of your children here in just a few minutes, but please join us again this week for a full hour because this is so huge.
[02:21:40.246 --> 02:21:47.649]  And I'm very honored this morning when we talked very early in the morning, nighttime, that because they're censoring you, you'd like to premiere some of these here.
[02:21:47.649 --> 02:21:51.771]  Anytime you want a show, anytime you want the InfoWars platform, buddy, it's yours.
[02:21:51.771 --> 02:21:52.571]  No censorship.
[02:21:52.571 --> 02:21:54.832]  You want the keys, you know, to the
[02:21:55.652 --> 02:22:02.056]  By going undercover on this organization and by recording conversations, what we found is all the things they tried to accuse us of, all of the things we found on them.
[02:22:02.056 --> 02:22:03.437]  We found allegations of blackmail,
[02:22:21.588 --> 02:22:24.789]  Blackmailing people to give negative information against me.
[02:22:24.789 --> 02:22:30.231]  Blackmailing people who had previously been informants, who didn't want the fact they'd been informants to come out.
[02:22:30.231 --> 02:22:33.692]  They used that as leverage to put them in a position they had to work with.
[02:22:33.692 --> 02:22:42.415]  Then we had allegations that one of them, that then they made sexual advances and a rape situation on this individual previously working with
[02:22:42.995 --> 02:22:48.297]  Then we heard, in undercover footage, a man who's trying to label me as extreme.
[02:22:48.297 --> 02:22:55.080]  The head of Panorama, John Sweeney, goes on to say that he worshipped and his political hero was Martin McGuinness.
[02:22:55.080 --> 02:22:57.681]  Martin McGuinness was the leader of the Irish Republican Army.
[02:22:57.681 --> 02:23:00.142]  He was responsible for bombing and blowing people up and murder.
[02:23:00.582 --> 02:23:01.723]  That's his hero.
[02:23:01.723 --> 02:23:04.005]  This is a man who's trying to portray me as extreme.
[02:23:04.005 --> 02:23:07.569]  Then it went on to find that he said he wants to shoot gays.
[02:23:07.569 --> 02:23:10.792]  He said that he referred to homosexuals as woofters.
[02:23:10.792 --> 02:23:13.534]  All of the labels they throw at us.
[02:23:13.534 --> 02:23:15.756]  And ten years I've had undercover footage on me.
[02:23:15.756 --> 02:23:17.338]  Ten years I've had cameras on me.
[02:23:17.338 --> 02:23:21.962]  Not once in ten years have they been able to manufacture anything I've said that warrants hate.
[02:23:22.522 --> 02:23:31.868]  In one boozy afternoon lunch of undercover footage against the head journalist for the BBC, I got every single label that they tried to put on us.
[02:23:31.868 --> 02:23:32.408]  He fitted.
[02:23:33.717 --> 02:23:39.542]  From homophobe to racist to extremist, all of them in one boozy lunch.
[02:23:39.542 --> 02:23:48.469]  So the point of these organisations that are working against us and basically what Hope Not Hate do, they're funded by George Soros.
[02:23:48.469 --> 02:23:49.550]  They issue reports.
[02:23:49.550 --> 02:23:52.773]  I spoke to other gentlemen who have had great careers and great jobs.
[02:23:52.773 --> 02:23:59.018]  They issue reports and they name people and they throw all the big words in, the Nazi, the racist, the extremist, with no evidence.
[02:23:59.538 --> 02:24:05.384]  Then, when they want to take someone down, they work hand-in-hand with the local media or the mainstream media.
[02:24:05.384 --> 02:24:08.808]  The mainstream media then take what Hope Not Hate say as fact.
[02:24:08.808 --> 02:24:17.917]  Even though Hope Not Hate have proven to over-exaggerate hate crime statistics by 3,000%, all of the wrongs Hope Not Hate are now alleged to blackmail people and rape them.
[02:24:18.557 --> 02:24:39.078]  All of these things, and the media and politicians work hand in hand with them to destroy you, to destroy me, to use it as ammunition to put to the UN, to put to the government, to put across the world in order to censor us, to tell the social media giants, which is what has happened today, what this has proven.
[02:24:39.578 --> 02:24:52.127]  Panodrama going out and within 24 hours of me being deleted has proven the influence that these far-left extremist organisations like Hope Not Hate and the establishment working together have.
[02:24:52.127 --> 02:24:54.668]  It's proven it all.
[02:24:54.668 --> 02:24:56.550]  I don't know how they don't realise this.
[02:24:56.550 --> 02:24:58.951]  They keep beating us down, we keep getting back up.
[02:24:58.951 --> 02:24:59.872]  Will this stop us?
[02:24:59.872 --> 02:25:00.692]  No, of course it won't.
[02:25:00.692 --> 02:25:02.634]  Alex, I'm very grateful for the offer you've just made.
[02:25:02.634 --> 02:25:04.915]  I'd love to speak to you more about that.
[02:25:04.915 --> 02:25:06.917]  We need a platform in Europe.
[02:25:06.917 --> 02:25:09.098]  We've needed it for a long time like this.
[02:25:09.418 --> 02:25:10.339]  We need info.
[02:25:10.339 --> 02:25:13.301]  We need it for the European news on a daily basis.
[02:25:13.301 --> 02:25:17.343]  We need it for the news in Britain, in Wales, in Scotland, in Germany.
[02:25:17.343 --> 02:25:17.924]  We've needed it.
[02:25:17.924 --> 02:25:19.145]  You need a people's voice.
[02:25:19.145 --> 02:25:22.047]  You've already almost taken the country back from the EU.
[02:25:22.047 --> 02:25:22.627]  You're winning.
[02:25:22.627 --> 02:25:23.127]  We're winning.
[02:25:23.127 --> 02:25:24.528]  Nationalism's exploding.
[02:25:24.528 --> 02:25:35.996]  If we can just hold the line, if our listeners can hold the line supporting us, and magnifying by hand, by email, by text message, to share the films, and InfoWars can host them, because it's only on YouTube now.
[02:25:35.996 --> 02:25:37.337]  They haven't taken you down yet.
[02:25:37.337 --> 02:25:38.418]  But here's the big news, Tommy.
[02:25:39.278 --> 02:25:42.320]  Clearly, clearly this is criminal.
[02:25:42.320 --> 02:25:43.421]  This is beyond defamation.
[02:25:43.421 --> 02:25:44.441]  They're trying to frame you.
[02:25:44.441 --> 02:25:46.122]  They're trying to destroy you.
[02:25:46.122 --> 02:25:50.745]  They have MI5 threatening Canberra people with jail if they don't turn against you.
[02:25:50.745 --> 02:25:51.986]  You've already been a political prisoner.
[02:25:51.986 --> 02:25:54.527]  This needs to be parliamentary hearings.
[02:25:54.527 --> 02:25:59.911]  This is the type of thing that opening up could bring down these incredible criminal operations.
[02:25:59.911 --> 02:26:02.572]  This is what Soros did in Ukraine to overthrow it.
[02:26:02.572 --> 02:26:05.034]  This is what Soros does to create the Arab Spring.
[02:26:05.034 --> 02:26:08.316]  They're trying to create riots here in America funding all this race-based stuff.
[02:26:08.536 --> 02:26:10.579]  You know Jesse Smollett was paid to do that.
[02:26:10.579 --> 02:26:11.680]  He's got accomplices.
[02:26:11.680 --> 02:26:18.650]  I told people days ago others are under investigation and now the police have come out and said yes, others are under investigation above Smollett.
[02:26:18.650 --> 02:26:19.711]  Tomorrow's news today.
[02:26:19.711 --> 02:26:20.913]  So we're winning.
[02:26:20.913 --> 02:26:23.557]  It's hard for you and I that are on the front lines and I know you know that.
[02:26:23.857 --> 02:26:27.201]  And you're not complaining, but folks need to know, we are winning.
[02:26:27.201 --> 02:26:29.404]  But for those of us on the front lines, it's very hard.
[02:26:29.404 --> 02:26:32.187]  We need your hopes, we need your prayers, we need your support.
[02:26:32.187 --> 02:26:35.451]  When we come back, we're going to air this censored documentary.
[02:26:35.451 --> 02:26:44.061]  Now, again, tell folks the difference between the BBC show, Panorama, the film is Panadrama, and how else they can see it.
[02:26:45.100 --> 02:26:45.841]  Panodrama.
[02:26:45.841 --> 02:26:46.842]  It's on YouTube.
[02:26:46.842 --> 02:26:49.144]  Take it and share it everywhere.
[02:26:49.144 --> 02:26:52.948]  It proves everything every one of you have been saying and thinking.
[02:26:52.948 --> 02:26:56.011]  It proves what Donald Trump said to the BBC.
[02:26:56.011 --> 02:26:57.473]  He said you're fake news.
[02:26:57.473 --> 02:26:58.674]  This programme proves it.
[02:26:59.255 --> 02:27:03.737]  This proves it categorically with evidence, with undercover footage, with all of it.
[02:27:03.737 --> 02:27:05.057]  It's got the full package.
[02:27:05.057 --> 02:27:08.398]  And I think it shocked them how powerful the documentary is.
[02:27:08.398 --> 02:27:15.241]  So all I could say is that people who want to know where I am, because I've just been deleted, www.tr.news.
[02:27:15.241 --> 02:27:18.722]  Currently, it's so people can still give me their information so I can contact them.
[02:27:19.523 --> 02:27:28.493]  The developments which are going to come and going to be built, whether it be webs, whether it be website, or apps, or with yourself Alex, then I will let everybody know.
[02:27:28.493 --> 02:27:30.235]  And that will be coming in the next coming weeks.
[02:27:30.235 --> 02:27:31.276]  Yeah, that's critical.
[02:27:31.276 --> 02:27:31.957]  That's critical.
[02:27:31.957 --> 02:27:37.043]  So again, what is the best place for people to find where Tommy Robinson, the person they're trying to suppress, is?
[02:27:38.527 --> 02:27:42.849]  Sign up for free at www.tr.news.
[02:27:42.849 --> 02:27:47.331]  That will enable me, the minute we're ready with our new platform, bang, here's where we are.
[02:27:47.331 --> 02:27:54.255]  Go on to my YouTube account, Tommy Robinson, take the footage, upload it everywhere for panodrama.
[02:27:54.255 --> 02:28:00.978]  Tommy, I know you've got to go, I've got to go, but let's talk a little bit later when we get off air today about the next plan.
[02:28:00.978 --> 02:28:02.499]  God bless you and we'll talk to you soon.
[02:28:03.643 --> 02:28:04.123]  Cool, Alex.
[02:28:04.123 --> 02:28:04.824]  Thank you, man.
[02:28:04.824 --> 02:28:05.284]  Thank you, everyone.
[02:28:05.284 --> 02:28:05.504]  Thank you.
[02:28:05.504 --> 02:28:06.685]  All right, we're going to go to break.
[02:28:06.685 --> 02:28:08.526]  And the same goes for InfoWars.
[02:28:08.526 --> 02:28:11.308]  InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[02:28:11.308 --> 02:28:19.393]  You've got to go give us your email so that we can get you censored videos, articles, and obviously, you know, supplement ads and things like that as well.
[02:28:19.393 --> 02:28:19.914]  Great deals.
[02:28:19.914 --> 02:28:24.196]  But it's about us being able to contact you and not have them get between us.
[02:28:24.196 --> 02:28:26.958]  InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[02:28:26.958 --> 02:28:30.821]  The video is posted panadrama up on InfoWars.com.
[02:28:31.261 --> 02:28:31.861]  Right now.
[02:28:31.861 --> 02:28:34.183]  Take that link from InfoWars.com and share it.
[02:28:34.183 --> 02:28:36.985]  It's also on NewsWars.com.
[02:28:36.985 --> 02:28:38.746]  NewsWars.com.
[02:28:38.746 --> 02:28:40.107]  That doesn't get censored as much.
[02:28:40.107 --> 02:28:42.348]  So get it from NewsWars.com.
[02:28:42.348 --> 02:28:45.390]  It's posted right up at the top of NewsWars.com.
[02:28:45.390 --> 02:28:47.451]  And share the link and get it around the censors.
[02:28:47.451 --> 02:28:51.574]  We're going to upload it to InfoWars servers as well in case YouTube takes it down.
[02:28:51.574 --> 02:28:53.635]  We'll be right back with the censored film.
[02:28:53.635 --> 02:28:54.536]  Please stay with us.
[02:28:54.536 --> 02:28:55.096]  InfoWars.com.

[02:29:00.279 --> 02:29:05.362]  I was 35 with two beautiful children when my life and addiction started to spiral out of control.
[02:29:05.362 --> 02:29:12.546]  After my divorce, I went into a depression cycle and started drinking more often and using prescription drugs.
[02:29:12.546 --> 02:29:17.089]  After my second DWI and arrest, my ex-husband threatened to take our children away from me.
[02:29:17.689 --> 02:29:21.332]  I was 17 when I became addicted to heroin and meth.
[02:29:21.332 --> 02:29:24.454]  I thought I could quit on my own, but I couldn't.
[02:29:24.454 --> 02:29:27.075]  It hit me when I was arrested.
[02:29:27.075 --> 02:29:28.576]  Get sober now.
[02:29:28.576 --> 02:29:31.919]  Your private insurance may cover costs and we'll get you here.

[02:30:14.626 --> 02:30:24.694]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.

[02:30:35.403 --> 02:30:36.564]  You must experience it.

[02:30:38.645 --> 02:30:43.568]  It comes in easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[02:30:43.568 --> 02:30:45.089]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[02:30:45.089 --> 02:30:46.570]  It lasts 10 hours.
[02:30:46.570 --> 02:30:53.255]  So take a half packet the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.

[02:31:57.945 --> 02:32:02.667]  Hard-working Americans need high-quality energy when they're on the run.
[02:32:02.667 --> 02:32:13.112]  And ladies and gentlemen, we have spent years working with top developers to come out with the highest quality protein bar in vanilla coconut and chocolate peanut butter at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:32:13.112 --> 02:32:17.274]  This is a high-end bar sold for up to six, seven dollars at Whole Foods.
[02:32:17.274 --> 02:32:20.156]  Normally we sell it for three dollars a piece when you get it in the box.
[02:32:20.836 --> 02:32:24.558]  But with the discount we're running right now as an introductory offer, it's $2.40 a bar.
[02:32:24.558 --> 02:32:28.100]  No one can top that, and it funds Liberty and the fight against the Globalists.

[02:32:41.828 --> 02:32:42.188]  It's easy.

[02:33:12.233 --> 02:33:16.496]  You're listening to the Antidote for Fake News.
[02:33:16.496 --> 02:33:18.638]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:18.638 --> 02:33:31.947]  Tonight, we expose the BBC with thousands of people outside their offices in Manchester.
[02:33:38.166 --> 02:33:49.911]  The British public do not trust you anymore.
[02:33:49.911 --> 02:33:53.032]  Get back!
[02:33:53.032 --> 02:33:56.453]  Get back!
[02:33:56.453 --> 02:33:57.434]  Stay back!
[02:34:10.462 --> 02:34:14.704]  Michael, he's going to explain what's going to happen next, right?
[02:34:14.704 --> 02:34:15.364]  I'm being arrested?
[02:34:15.364 --> 02:34:16.605]  I am being arrested.
[02:34:16.605 --> 02:34:17.926]  I've caused a breach of peace.
[02:34:17.926 --> 02:34:19.226]  I've caused a breach of peace.
[02:34:19.226 --> 02:34:19.747]  I'm being arrested.
[02:34:19.747 --> 02:34:25.429]  The content of what you're streaming... The content of what I'm streaming... I'm being arrested for breach of peace.
[02:34:25.429 --> 02:34:27.230]  I'm being arrested for breach of peace.
[02:34:27.230 --> 02:34:27.971]  You've all watched this.
[02:34:27.971 --> 02:34:29.011]  You've all watched this.
[02:34:29.011 --> 02:34:30.492]  You've all watched this.
[02:34:30.492 --> 02:34:31.552]  You've all watched this.
[02:34:31.552 --> 02:34:32.413]  Can you get me a snitcher?
[02:34:32.413 --> 02:34:33.473]  Can you get me a snitcher?
[02:34:33.473 --> 02:34:34.894]  Can you just turn up your light, please?
[02:34:34.894 --> 02:34:35.834]  Can you get me a snitcher?
[02:34:35.834 --> 02:34:36.915]  Turn up your light, please.
[02:34:36.915 --> 02:34:37.055]  Yeah?
[02:34:37.295 --> 02:34:43.957]  Since my activism started over a decade ago, the establishment, the police and the media have all been trying to take me down.
[02:35:03.706 --> 02:35:08.190]  The whole world saw me wrongfully imprisoned last year.
[02:35:08.190 --> 02:35:11.113]  Two and a half months on solitary confinement.
[02:35:11.113 --> 02:35:15.977]  What was the response by the media to that unlawful detention?
[02:35:15.977 --> 02:35:17.478]  They justified it.
[02:35:17.478 --> 02:35:19.080]  They lied to you.
[02:35:19.080 --> 02:35:22.203]  All of them reported that I pled guilty.
[02:35:22.203 --> 02:35:25.286]  None of them got the transcripts from the court.
[02:35:25.286 --> 02:35:27.948]  None of them reported the truth.
[02:35:27.948 --> 02:35:29.770]  We have a corrupt media.
[02:35:30.848 --> 02:35:40.013]  When I went to prison and 600,000 people signed a petition for my release, 30,000 people marched here demanding my release.
[02:35:40.013 --> 02:35:47.298]  When I come out of prison, I was completely unaware of the lengths that they were going to take me down.
[02:35:48.158 --> 02:35:50.100]  My PayPal was removed.
[02:35:50.100 --> 02:35:54.724]  That removes my ability to hire a team and work and bring you the other side of the story.
[02:35:54.724 --> 02:35:56.185]  My website was closed down.
[02:35:56.185 --> 02:36:07.934]  But I was completely unaware that Panorama, the world's leading investigative journalist documentary, were working on a program about me with the working title
[02:36:08.855 --> 02:36:10.057]  Tommy Takedown.
[02:36:10.057 --> 02:36:12.140]  This was their final punch.
[02:36:12.140 --> 02:36:15.405]  They were about to discredit me to the nation.
[02:36:15.405 --> 02:36:17.307]  To you, the public.
[02:36:17.307 --> 02:36:21.854]  And I will prove that that documentary is not impartial.
[02:36:21.854 --> 02:36:23.276]  That it's scripted.
[02:36:23.276 --> 02:36:24.458]  That they invent things.
[02:36:24.998 --> 02:36:28.320]  That they lie, that they clip, that they edit.
[02:36:28.320 --> 02:36:34.063]  What you will witness in this documentary will prove to you this isn't about Tommy Robinson.
[02:36:34.063 --> 02:36:37.504]  This is about all the people that have been lied to.
[02:36:37.504 --> 02:36:43.227]  All the people who have been mislabeled, despite all their efforts to silence me.
[02:36:43.227 --> 02:36:48.670]  It becomes very apparent that something far more sinister was going on.
[02:36:48.670 --> 02:36:52.052]  With the collusion between the establishment, Panorama,
[02:36:53.737 --> 02:36:56.882]  And a far-left extremist organisation called Hope Not Hate.
[02:36:56.882 --> 02:37:07.316]  You're going to hear about the tactics they use to get the narrative they want.
[02:37:07.316 --> 02:37:09.780]  In this documentary, you're going to hear a lot about Hope Not Hate.
[02:37:10.834 --> 02:37:12.716]  It's important you understand who they are.
[02:37:12.716 --> 02:37:17.600]  Hope Not Hate is a so-called anti-fascist organisation who formed in 2004.
[02:37:17.600 --> 02:37:21.644]  They formed from a group and a magazine called Searchlight.
[02:37:21.644 --> 02:37:25.628]  Nick Lowles, who now leads Hope Not Hate, was a lead member of Searchlight.
[02:37:25.928 --> 02:37:34.234]  In 1984, Searchlight worked alongside Panorama to fraudulently edit footage which they were prosecuted or taken to court and sued for.
[02:37:34.234 --> 02:37:42.259]  They paid a million pound damages to Conservative MPs who they wrongfully edited footage to link them with far-right extremist groups.
[02:37:42.259 --> 02:37:45.321]  I hope not hate brand themselves as an anti-fascist organization.
[02:37:45.321 --> 02:37:46.662]  They're there to tackle fascism.
[02:37:46.662 --> 02:37:53.166]  In reality, they label slander and attack anyone who speaks out against open borders or against Islam.
[02:37:53.166 --> 02:37:55.208]  The worrying thing is they have a lot of influence.
[02:37:55.828 --> 02:38:02.955]  For example, all media outlets across the UK, across the world, take what they say is credible and they work hand-in-hand with them.
[02:38:02.955 --> 02:38:13.044]  From CNN, The Guardian, Huffington Post, The Independent, Sky News, Newsnight, Panorama, The Metro, The Sunday Times, they even advise the UN.
[02:38:13.044 --> 02:38:15.987]  They advise counter-terrorism in their advice to the UN.
[02:38:16.607 --> 02:38:21.992]  They say that our Day for Freedom demonstration that many of you would have watched was a far-right extremist rally.
[02:38:21.992 --> 02:38:23.414]  That's fake news!
[02:38:23.414 --> 02:38:29.019]  Being given as credible information and taken as expert info by the UN!
[02:38:29.019 --> 02:38:36.266]  Our Day for Freedom demonstration had homosexual speakers, drag artists, black speakers, Asian speakers.
[02:38:36.266 --> 02:38:38.228]  There was nothing far-right against it.
[02:38:38.228 --> 02:38:41.091]  It was a liberal demonstration demanding free speech.
[02:38:41.431 --> 02:38:54.698]  So what happens is when someone gets censored on Twitter for some kind of hate speech or for incitement to violence or engaging in some kind of terrorist communication, they get their account taken down.
[02:38:54.698 --> 02:39:03.022]  They tend to come back and that actually leads to sort of an increased level of sense of participation and integration into these networks.
[02:39:03.022 --> 02:39:07.664]  So I do a lot of work looking into right-wing extremism in the United Kingdom and the United States.
[02:39:09.278 --> 02:39:18.306]  And one of the things that we've seen there is actually an entire mobilization of right-wing extremist activity around the concept of the freedom of speech being taken away from people.
[02:39:18.306 --> 02:39:30.576]  So just a few weeks ago in London there was a march attended by a few thousand people that was called Day for Freedom and that was entirely sort of centered around this issue of free speech and the sense that
[02:39:30.796 --> 02:39:34.739]  Just last year, Hope Not Hate were identified in a Swedish military report on left-wing extremist violence.
[02:39:48.371 --> 02:39:54.897]  It has been proven that Hope Not Hate exaggerated hate crime figures by 3000%.
[02:39:54.897 --> 02:40:06.068]  Nothing they said after that point should ever have been taken as credible, let alone taken by journalists without checking anything and spread around the world to demonise and slander people and organisations.
[02:40:06.068 --> 02:40:10.212]  They play a key role in pressurising social media giants.
[02:40:10.452 --> 02:40:17.201]  Whether it be with petitions or requests from MPs that they're working alongside with to say who's promoting hate.
[02:40:17.201 --> 02:40:23.149]  Not who's promoting hate that would breach laws in this country, but who needs silencing with their opinion?
[02:40:23.149 --> 02:40:26.453]  They're now teaching your children in schools about
[02:40:26.874 --> 02:40:27.574]  Fascism.
[02:40:27.574 --> 02:40:31.176]  If we take a quote from their original spin doctor, Dan Hodgson.
[02:40:31.176 --> 02:40:34.498]  From his quote, you'll understand the tactics they use in this documentary.
[02:40:34.498 --> 02:40:37.280]  It was a no-holds-barred, bare-knuckle PR.
[02:40:37.280 --> 02:40:43.423]  We used every dirty, underhand, low-down, unscrupulous trick in the book.
[02:40:43.743 --> 02:40:49.166]  Here's a quote from the spin doctor, Joe Mulhall, who is a lead researcher for Hope Not Hate.
[02:40:49.166 --> 02:40:52.548]  He brags about days out with their BBC political reporters.
[02:40:52.548 --> 02:40:57.711]  Their relationship works hand in hand with the corrupt mainstream media.
[02:40:57.711 --> 02:41:06.655]  They do the reports, the media then use their ammunition and their labeling to attack people and organizations, to demonize them and slander them.
[02:41:06.655 --> 02:41:09.297]  In 2015, Joe Mulhall used the hashtag Antifa
[02:41:09.617 --> 02:41:10.878]  on several occasions.
[02:41:10.878 --> 02:41:15.281]  The reason why this is so relevant is when you understand who Antifa are.
[02:41:15.281 --> 02:41:21.805]  Antifa are an organisation that leading members of the American government have called to be prescribed as a terrorist organisation.
[02:41:21.805 --> 02:41:32.513]  They balaclava up, they mask up and they violently attack people who they're told to attack and organisations which are highlighted to them by groups and organisations like Hope Not Hate.
[02:41:32.513 --> 02:41:36.756]  They find out who you are, they contact your work, anyone who steps above the parapet.
[02:41:37.276 --> 02:41:40.598]  Hope Not Hate's goal is to silence them and stop them.
[02:41:40.598 --> 02:41:42.720]  This is about stopping free speech.
[02:41:42.720 --> 02:41:46.022]  This is about having people too scared to speak.
[02:41:46.022 --> 02:41:52.587]  We'll speak with one gentleman now whose life has been completely changed due to him voicing his opinions.
[02:41:52.587 --> 02:41:54.469]  He broke no law.
[02:41:54.469 --> 02:41:56.030]  Committed no crime.
[02:41:56.971 --> 02:41:59.652]  But wait till you hear what Hope Not Hate done to him.
[02:41:59.652 --> 02:42:14.581]  This time last year, like I said, I was working full-time, happy, and because of some things I was doing outside of work, where I sort of expressed my political opinions and so on, I ended up drawing their fire, and they wrote a report and called it in to the employer.
[02:42:14.581 --> 02:42:20.704]  So it was a kind of deliberate attempt to... It wasn't just to dox me, because I hadn't hidden my name, I didn't think I was doing anything wrong.
[02:42:20.704 --> 02:42:22.245]  I was just expressing an opinion.
[02:42:23.186 --> 02:42:25.307]  Uh, but it was an attempt to deliberately get me fired.
[02:42:25.307 --> 02:42:26.028]  Where was you working?
[02:42:26.028 --> 02:42:28.330]  I was working at Standard Chartered Bank in Moorgate.
[02:42:28.330 --> 02:42:29.151]  Doing what?
[02:42:29.151 --> 02:42:31.713]  Uh, I was an associate, so I've been there from a grad.
[02:42:31.713 --> 02:42:34.856]  I went to Bristol University and then went into the bank straight afterwards.
[02:42:34.856 --> 02:42:38.499]  So I've been there for about, just around 18 months at this point.
[02:42:38.499 --> 02:42:39.339]  So a good career?
[02:42:39.339 --> 02:42:40.200]  Yeah, it was going well.
[02:42:40.200 --> 02:42:41.741]  Internally, there'd been no issues.
[02:42:41.741 --> 02:42:46.405]  When you say, when you say you got involved, you was giving your political opinions with regards to?
[02:42:46.405 --> 02:42:48.787]  Uh, obviously the controversial stuff, so immigration.
[02:42:55.077 --> 02:43:00.803]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful products ever made.

[02:47:24.975 --> 02:47:39.908]  This time last year, like I said, I was working full-time, happy, and because of some things I was doing outside of work, where I sort of expressed my political opinions and so on, I ended up drawing their fire, and they wrote a report and called it in to the employer.
[02:47:39.908 --> 02:47:44.912]  So it was a kind of deliberate attempt to... It wasn't just to dox me, because I hadn't hidden my name.
[02:47:44.912 --> 02:47:46.033]  I didn't think I was doing anything wrong.
[02:47:46.033 --> 02:47:47.575]  I was just expressing an opinion.
[02:47:48.495 --> 02:47:50.477]  Uh, but it was an attempt to deliberately get me fired.
[02:47:50.477 --> 02:47:51.437]  Where was you working?
[02:47:51.437 --> 02:47:53.658]  I was working at Standard Chartered Bank in Moorgate.
[02:47:53.658 --> 02:47:54.479]  Doing what?
[02:47:54.479 --> 02:47:57.020]  Uh, I was an associate, so I'd been there from a grad.
[02:47:57.020 --> 02:48:00.162]  I went to Bristol University and then went into the bank straight afterwards.
[02:48:00.162 --> 02:48:03.824]  So I'd been there for about, just around 18 months at this point.
[02:48:03.824 --> 02:48:04.285]  So a good career?
[02:48:04.285 --> 02:48:05.525]  Yeah, it was going well.
[02:48:05.525 --> 02:48:07.066]  Internally, there'd been no issues.
[02:48:07.066 --> 02:48:10.148]  When you say, when you say you got involved, you was giving your political opinions?
[02:48:10.148 --> 02:48:10.448]  Yeah.
[02:48:10.448 --> 02:48:11.009]  With regards to?
[02:48:12.169 --> 02:48:19.856]  Obviously the controversial stuff, so immigration, Islam, these kind of issues, but not in an extreme way, nothing you wouldn't happily say to anyone.
[02:48:19.856 --> 02:48:25.800]  Just so we can get clear, we're not talking about committing a crime, we're just talking about speaking openly about immigration and Islam.
[02:48:25.800 --> 02:48:27.302]  Yeah, and no one had a problem with it.
[02:48:28.102 --> 02:48:30.244]  That's the whole point that kind of strikes me about it.
[02:48:30.244 --> 02:48:32.365]  It's not like anyone made a complaint.
[02:48:32.365 --> 02:48:33.126]  Nothing's happened.
[02:48:33.126 --> 02:48:35.668]  So what did Hope Not Hate do?
[02:48:35.668 --> 02:48:40.011]  So Hope Not Hate, one of their, I can't remember which, but a team of their researchers wrote a small report.
[02:48:40.011 --> 02:48:46.596]  They were calling up multiple offices at the bank and they were also focusing, because obviously we have a very big presence in the Middle East,
[02:48:47.236 --> 02:48:55.467]  So they were focusing on officers there to call them and just basically say, you've got this guy working for you, he's an Islamophobe, he's a racist, blah, blah, blah, all of which obviously isn't true.
[02:48:55.467 --> 02:49:01.454]  I remember I was just sitting at my desk and I get called in by the MD and he sort of says, have you been saying this?
[02:49:01.454 --> 02:49:02.916]  And I say, yeah, I have.
[02:49:03.817 --> 02:49:05.198]  I didn't see it as a problem.
[02:49:05.198 --> 02:49:09.882]  The same guys were going to a lot of journalists, trying to flog this report as well, to make a big story out of it.
[02:49:09.882 --> 02:49:18.449]  Eventually, in around the summer of last year, you get this article, and it's very vicious, and it's obviously largely lifted from the report that came out a few weeks earlier.
[02:49:18.449 --> 02:49:23.433]  You know, using slurs, using kind of nonsense labels, calling us Nazis, all that kind of thing.
[02:49:23.433 --> 02:49:24.794]  Calling you Nazis, with any evidence?
[02:49:24.794 --> 02:49:25.675]  Was there anything you said?
[02:49:25.675 --> 02:49:26.476]  No evidence whatsoever, at all.
[02:49:26.476 --> 02:49:28.538]  It was made up with a very clear intention of
[02:49:29.278 --> 02:49:30.258]  Make me lose my job.
[02:49:30.258 --> 02:49:31.339]  And it is a common tactic.
[02:49:31.339 --> 02:49:32.359]  And you did lose your job?
[02:49:32.359 --> 02:49:33.280]  Yeah, I was suspended.
[02:49:33.280 --> 02:49:43.004]  And then, once the coverage happened, they obviously, whilst previously, like, internally, the bank, I think, had kind of thought, well, maybe this is just an attack piece.
[02:49:43.004 --> 02:49:46.245]  Once there was coverage, obviously, it's their reputation on the line.
[02:49:46.245 --> 02:49:48.967]  So then, pretty much immediately, I was fired.
[02:49:48.967 --> 02:49:51.988]  I have worked... Just so that the public understand this,
[02:49:54.178 --> 02:49:59.501]  You speak, outside of work, about immigration or Islam, with no hatred.
[02:49:59.501 --> 02:50:00.122]  No hatred.
[02:50:00.122 --> 02:50:01.603]  Just facts.
[02:50:01.603 --> 02:50:03.704]  And because of that, you're... Where are you now?
[02:50:03.704 --> 02:50:05.065]  How's your life changed?
[02:50:05.065 --> 02:50:06.846]  What do you see for your future, now?
[02:50:06.846 --> 02:50:11.229]  Financially very difficult, of course, because it kills your income.
[02:50:11.229 --> 02:50:14.211]  And then there's knock-ons from that that are always a pain.
[02:50:14.211 --> 02:50:14.811]  OK, well, thanks.
[02:50:14.811 --> 02:50:17.673]  I hope you... I wish you luck in trying to get your life sorted.
[02:50:17.673 --> 02:50:18.474]  Me too.
[02:50:18.474 --> 02:50:19.514]  Yeah, good luck.
[02:50:19.514 --> 02:50:19.754]  Thank you.
[02:50:21.795 --> 02:50:23.316]  So you've heard from Tom Dupree.
[02:50:23.316 --> 02:50:28.459]  You've heard how his life was changed simply for expressing his free speech due to the actions of Hope Not Hate.
[02:50:28.459 --> 02:50:34.643]  Later on in this documentary, you'll hear recordings of Kalen Robertson and George Llewellyn-John to see how their lives have been affected.
[02:50:34.643 --> 02:50:38.506]  Kalen and George used to work me at Rebel Media, and when I went independent, they come to work me there.
[02:50:38.506 --> 02:50:41.388]  When I was released from prison, I met with them.
[02:50:41.388 --> 02:50:46.011]  They said that they had been intimidated and threatened, and for that reason, they couldn't work with me.
[02:50:46.811 --> 02:50:48.252]  I'd just been released from prison.
[02:50:48.252 --> 02:50:49.794]  I wasn't in a good state.
[02:50:49.794 --> 02:50:53.556]  And I thought they were just saying that because they wanted to go and work with Lauren Southern.
[02:50:53.556 --> 02:50:55.378]  Also, you'll hear recordings from Lauren Southern.
[02:50:55.378 --> 02:50:58.220]  Lauren Southern is a leading political activist from Canada.
[02:50:58.220 --> 02:51:00.501]  She now works as a journalist making documentaries.
[02:51:00.501 --> 02:51:05.025]  In those recordings, you'll hear about allegations about how they've suffered due to the actions of Hope Knight.
[02:51:08.530 --> 02:51:10.851]  So, I've been contacted by Lucy Brown, who's an ex-employee.
[02:51:10.851 --> 02:51:14.593]  The last time we spoke to each other, we were screaming obscenities at each other.
[02:51:14.593 --> 02:51:22.437]  Now, she's been contacted by Hope Not Hate and by Panorama, who are working together on a project against me.
[02:51:22.437 --> 02:51:24.298]  Working title, Tommy Taper.
[02:51:24.298 --> 02:51:27.080]  So, I'm on the way to see Lucy.
[02:51:27.080 --> 02:51:35.184]  I'm actually really concerned and worried about what it is they're up to, because I know everything they've tried to do to take me down hasn't worked.
[02:51:35.184 --> 02:51:37.345]  So, let's see what's next.
[02:51:38.607 --> 02:51:45.431]  Last time I spoke to you, I screamed some obscene, some terrible things down the front.
[02:51:45.431 --> 02:51:48.832]  So did I. I also have a surprise for you.
[02:51:48.832 --> 02:51:50.133]  Go on.
[02:51:50.133 --> 02:51:55.016]  I thought I'd commiserate it, so I actually got your prison number.
[02:51:55.016 --> 02:51:56.917]  No, you haven't!
[02:51:56.917 --> 02:52:00.979]  To remind myself the happiest day of my life.
[02:52:05.049 --> 02:52:06.790]  What?!
[02:52:06.790 --> 02:52:07.730]  A2084CG?!
[02:52:07.730 --> 02:52:08.590]  Yeah, that's the one.
[02:52:08.590 --> 02:52:09.290]  Oh my God!
[02:52:09.290 --> 02:52:11.011]  I laughed my head off.
[02:52:11.011 --> 02:52:13.571]  Oh my God!
[02:52:13.571 --> 02:52:16.652]  Shit, Lucy, you were fucking angry!
[02:52:16.652 --> 02:52:17.793]  How have we ended up sitting here?
[02:52:17.793 --> 02:52:20.593]  And what are we talking about?
[02:52:20.593 --> 02:52:30.236]  Well, I received a very interesting email from one John Sweeney a couple of days ago, who is a big... Was it BBC presenter?
[02:52:30.236 --> 02:52:30.496]  Panorama.
[02:52:30.496 --> 02:52:30.736]  Panorama.
[02:52:33.598 --> 02:52:34.359]  Yes, apparently.
[02:52:34.359 --> 02:52:35.940]  He's quite well known.
[02:52:35.940 --> 02:52:40.704]  And he's asking if I want to go for a... First it was a cup of tea, but then it was a pint.
[02:52:40.704 --> 02:52:44.288]  And he'll come all the way to Cambridge to see me.
[02:52:44.288 --> 02:52:47.110]  And I think he wants some dirt on you.
[02:52:47.110 --> 02:52:47.751]  He was approached.
[02:52:48.928 --> 02:52:49.509]  What are you?
[02:52:49.509 --> 02:52:50.609]  Joe Mulholl?
[02:52:50.609 --> 02:52:51.730]  Joe Mulholl, yes.
[02:52:51.730 --> 02:52:52.871]  Hope Not Hate.
[02:52:52.871 --> 02:52:56.034]  So you approached by Hope Not Hate, who told you, I've seen what they've told you.
[02:52:56.034 --> 02:52:56.594]  Yep.
[02:52:56.594 --> 02:52:58.936]  They told you that there's a Take Tommy Down.
[02:52:58.936 --> 02:53:00.097]  There's a Tommy Take Down.
[02:53:00.097 --> 02:53:01.018]  Tommy Take Down.
[02:53:01.018 --> 02:53:09.985]  Yes, and they've been taken on as sort of advisors to the BBC to help them with interviews and to get information about you.
[02:53:10.871 --> 02:53:17.773]  How easy would it have been for you to... They offered me five grand for a front page story about you being a twat.
[02:53:17.773 --> 02:53:23.494]  What you could have done, you could have absolutely destroyed me, and my life, and my name, and my reputation.
[02:53:23.494 --> 02:53:25.234]  More so than that prison number did.
[02:53:25.234 --> 02:53:26.915]  More so than me going in prison could have done.
[02:53:26.915 --> 02:53:30.496]  Because you could have said anything, and they would run.
[02:53:30.496 --> 02:53:33.976]  I've arranged to meet John Sweeney tomorrow at 2pm, and...
[02:53:36.636 --> 02:53:43.142]  By the sounds of it, what these people do is they try and be your friend when you're vulnerable, and they apply you with drink.
[02:53:43.142 --> 02:53:45.604]  And they try to get you to say something that you wouldn't normally say.
[02:53:45.604 --> 02:53:50.548]  I want to show what Lucy could have done.
[02:53:50.548 --> 02:53:52.830]  None of it would be factual, but what Lucy could have done.
[02:53:52.830 --> 02:53:54.852]  Now bear in mind, I might not have been here.
[02:53:54.852 --> 02:53:57.014]  You could have just done this.
[02:53:57.014 --> 02:53:58.095]  Fake text messages.
[02:53:58.095 --> 02:54:00.417]  Falsify sender numbers with text.
[02:54:00.417 --> 02:54:03.019]  So if you wanted to, my phone would be here.
[02:54:04.218 --> 02:54:07.619]  Let's change the number there, and we'll keep that as we said.
[02:54:07.619 --> 02:54:08.959]  Let's put my number, yeah?
[02:54:08.959 --> 02:54:15.060]  So you respectively, as a disgruntled employee who fucking got in prison on a title, don't you guys?
[02:54:15.060 --> 02:54:17.241]  Joe Morgan's just messaged me.
[02:54:17.241 --> 02:54:17.941]  Let's take down Tommy.
[02:54:17.941 --> 02:54:21.982]  I'm fat broke, I've got no means of income, I hate you.
[02:54:21.982 --> 02:54:27.823]  Joe Morgan's just messaged me saying I can get you some money to do Tommy in.
[02:54:27.823 --> 02:54:33.264]  So I can go to fakemytext.co.uk and I can make you text me
[02:54:33.891 --> 02:54:36.472]  And then I can show... Panorama!
[02:54:36.472 --> 02:54:37.833]  My phone's here.
[02:54:37.833 --> 02:54:38.953]  I'm at home.
[02:54:38.953 --> 02:54:40.013]  Right.
[02:54:40.013 --> 02:54:41.254]  Minding my own business.
[02:54:41.254 --> 02:54:42.514]  I've got Joe Mulgrew there.
[02:54:42.514 --> 02:54:46.396]  Joe Mulgrew offering the takedown of Tommy Robinson.
[02:54:46.396 --> 02:54:51.478]  Offering you some money, and you have said to me... What?
[02:54:51.478 --> 02:54:55.840]  If you have anything to do with the Panorama campaign, I will fucking bury you.
[02:54:59.755 --> 02:55:03.102]  Hang on, because I'm writing Y-O-U, but you write U. I write U. Sorry.
[02:55:03.102 --> 02:55:06.007]  I just need to make up some bad grammar because, um...
[02:55:08.835 --> 02:55:14.476]  Yeah, drop the T's, because I don't pronounce my T. I'm going to put W-I-A-V instead of with.
[02:55:14.476 --> 02:55:17.117]  There's Panorama... You wouldn't make that a capital letter?
[02:55:17.117 --> 02:55:18.017]  No, I'd put with.
[02:55:18.017 --> 02:55:18.317]  With.
[02:55:18.317 --> 02:55:18.877]  I'd put with.
[02:55:18.877 --> 02:55:19.897]  Okay, alright.
[02:55:19.897 --> 02:55:20.918]  There's Panorama Dock.
[02:55:20.918 --> 02:55:25.419]  If you have anything to do with Panorama Dock, I will fucking bury you, comma.
[02:55:25.419 --> 02:55:26.959]  Bury you, you bitch.
[02:55:26.959 --> 02:55:29.159]  Just to prove, I could have nothing to do with this.
[02:55:29.159 --> 02:55:30.400]  I'm not... My phone's here.
[02:55:30.400 --> 02:55:31.460]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:55:31.460 --> 02:55:32.980]  So I've not sent you a message.
[02:55:32.980 --> 02:55:34.301]  Yeah, so let's wait.
[02:55:34.301 --> 02:55:35.781]  And the point is...
[02:55:37.208 --> 02:55:39.591]  That they're actively searching with a far-left organisation.
[02:55:39.591 --> 02:55:42.995]  They're actively working with my ex-employees to bring me down.
[02:55:42.995 --> 02:55:50.924]  What I want to prove here is how easy it is, and how many other things in this documentary have been faked, on me.
[02:55:50.924 --> 02:55:56.071]  If you had anything to do with this panorama doc, I'll fucking bury you, you bitch.
[02:55:56.071 --> 02:55:56.972]  Can you focus on that?
[02:55:59.122 --> 02:56:00.563]  So, I didn't send that.
[02:56:00.563 --> 02:56:02.303]  That's sent from my computer.
[02:56:02.303 --> 02:56:04.544]  My phone has not sent you a single message.
[02:56:04.544 --> 02:56:07.165]  Now, Panorama are the biggest investigative journalists in the world.
[02:56:07.165 --> 02:56:09.505]  So, I don't see how this can work.
[02:56:09.505 --> 02:56:14.207]  If they wanted to do a proper investigative journalist piece, they should look at the crime that I committed.
[02:56:14.207 --> 02:56:15.567]  Was it criminal?
[02:56:15.567 --> 02:56:16.648]  Did the judge act out a law?
[02:56:17.308 --> 02:56:19.629]  Was I treating, were my human rights abused?
[02:56:19.629 --> 02:56:24.590]  One of the biggest cases in this country's history, in fucking, in modern time, yeah?
[02:56:24.590 --> 02:56:34.812]  600,000 people signed a petition, 30,000 people marching, ambassadors from the American government, every political party in Europe talking about it, the most talked about court case in decades, and they're not bothered about it.
[02:56:34.812 --> 02:56:36.792]  This is fake, yeah?
[02:56:36.792 --> 02:56:44.254]  This is going to be falsified, this is not me, and I want to see if this, by a disgruntled ex-employee, could make its way around the world.
[02:56:44.986 --> 02:56:50.454]  I'd like to see how much power Hope Not Hate have over the world's media.
[02:56:50.454 --> 02:56:51.376]  Yeah, basically.
[02:56:59.656 --> 02:57:02.337]  This is the little minute.
[02:57:02.337 --> 02:57:03.738]  This will replace your button.
[02:57:03.738 --> 02:57:04.478]  Cool.
[02:57:04.478 --> 02:57:06.779]  This will go into your button, anyway.
[02:57:06.779 --> 02:57:10.740]  This is how we'll record, and... Are you nervous?
[02:57:10.740 --> 02:57:11.140]  No.
[02:57:11.140 --> 02:57:12.621]  You should be.
[02:57:12.621 --> 02:57:13.661]  You should be.
[02:57:13.661 --> 02:57:17.423]  And... Well, let's just wait and see what we get from this.
[02:57:17.423 --> 02:57:19.783]  Time will tell, but good luck.
[02:57:19.783 --> 02:57:22.484]  And don't do anything I wouldn't do.
[02:57:22.484 --> 02:57:22.845]  Thanks, mate.
[02:57:22.845 --> 02:57:23.525]  See you later.
[02:57:34.851 --> 02:57:35.732]  Success?
[02:57:35.732 --> 02:57:36.874]  Mission accomplished.
[02:57:36.874 --> 02:57:39.779]  Mission accomplished.
[02:57:39.779 --> 02:57:40.400]  Let's see.
[02:57:54.574 --> 02:58:03.576]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[02:58:03.576 --> 02:58:13.659]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[02:58:13.659 --> 02:58:22.201]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[02:58:23.021 --> 02:58:24.361]  There's nothing else like it.
[02:58:24.361 --> 02:58:25.522]  You must experience it.
[02:58:25.522 --> 02:58:27.482]  It is a total game-changer.
[02:58:27.482 --> 02:58:32.524]  And it comes in easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[02:58:32.524 --> 02:58:34.044]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[02:58:34.044 --> 02:58:35.525]  It lasts up to 10 hours.
[02:58:35.525 --> 02:58:42.226]  So take a half-pack the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[02:58:42.226 --> 02:58:46.628]  TurboForce at InForceLife.com.
[02:58:46.628 --> 02:58:49.728]  Our grandparents, the great-grandparents, they canned food.
[02:58:49.728 --> 02:58:51.249]  During the fall, so they'd have it during the winter.
[02:58:52.633 --> 02:58:55.578]  And that's what I'm talking about at InfoWarsTour.com.
[02:58:55.578 --> 02:59:00.167]  With InfoWars Select, it's the full spectrum of my patron supply on the top.

[02:59:49.195 --> 02:59:51.837]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:57.233 --> 03:00:03.484]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:06.562 --> 03:00:07.562]  Alex Jones joins us.
[03:00:07.562 --> 03:00:08.523]  Hi, Alex.
[03:00:08.523 --> 03:00:08.903]  Hey, man.
[03:00:08.903 --> 03:00:10.023]  It's good to be here with you.
[03:00:10.023 --> 03:00:13.545]  Okay, so, um, yeah, why don't you quit?
[03:00:13.545 --> 03:00:14.925]  I mean, I don't want you to quit.
[03:00:14.925 --> 03:00:19.307]  I like living in a world where we have, you know, all kinds of people talking.
[03:00:19.307 --> 03:00:20.867]  I really, I'm a free speech guy.
[03:00:20.867 --> 03:00:26.509]  I got a free speech tattoo, and I think, you know, the most outlandish stuff should be protected.
[03:00:26.509 --> 03:00:29.870]  We don't need free speech for ABC, CBS, NBC.
[03:00:29.870 --> 03:00:31.211]  They're already fine.
[03:00:31.211 --> 03:00:33.712]  We need free speech for some of the fringe people.
[03:00:34.432 --> 03:00:41.536]  That's right, but because the fringe has become dominant, we're being taken off the air because we do threaten the ABCs and the NFL.
[03:00:41.536 --> 03:00:47.660]  Look, the NFL wanted to force-feed all its anti-American garbage for three years and take knees, and it wounded them.
[03:00:47.660 --> 03:00:51.942]  They lost 30 to 40 percent of their audience, and that's what the numbers show.
[03:00:51.942 --> 03:00:53.283]  People are tuning out of it.
[03:00:53.283 --> 03:00:58.166]  So, they established that if they take us off the air, that suddenly people will go back to watching them.
[03:00:58.166 --> 03:00:58.306]  No.
[03:00:58.806 --> 03:01:00.348]  Competition has now been entered.
[03:01:00.348 --> 03:01:01.890]  The internet is now out there.
[03:01:01.890 --> 03:01:03.351]  You'll never be able to shut it all down.
[03:01:03.351 --> 03:01:04.392]  It's over.
[03:01:04.392 --> 03:01:06.795]  The old guard, the old establishment is done.
[03:01:06.795 --> 03:01:10.379]  You know, I won't watch the NFL anymore, and I won't participate.
[03:01:10.379 --> 03:01:14.624]  I did bet on the game and make some money, but what are they trying?
[03:01:14.624 --> 03:01:16.105]  They wouldn't do anything that's pro-American.
[03:01:17.988 --> 03:01:19.590]  What are they trying to promote, Alex?
[03:01:19.590 --> 03:01:28.003]  I understand it, with the kneeling and the anti-cop sentiment and they wouldn't accept military ads, some anti-military, anti-anything patriotic they don't like.
[03:01:28.003 --> 03:01:30.487]  So what does the NFL stand for now?
[03:01:30.487 --> 03:01:31.709]  You were on my show last week.
[03:01:32.572 --> 03:01:32.772]  Yes.
[03:01:32.772 --> 03:01:32.892]  Yes.
[03:01:51.910 --> 03:01:53.571]  ...competing in this new global order.
[03:01:53.571 --> 03:01:55.232]  They want to demoralize America.
[03:01:55.232 --> 03:01:56.793]  They want to make us hate our country.
[03:01:56.793 --> 03:01:58.815]  That's what you do when you're taking a country over.
[03:01:58.815 --> 03:02:01.256]  I mean, they say Trump can't say that we're a nation.
[03:02:01.256 --> 03:02:03.578]  That nation is a dirty word.
[03:02:03.578 --> 03:02:04.939]  That's what globalism does.
[03:02:04.939 --> 03:02:12.644]  Well, the word man... The word man, I mean, saying being a man is somehow vile and sexist or something.
[03:02:12.644 --> 03:02:14.085]  You can't say being a man to somebody.
[03:02:14.932 --> 03:02:19.195]  Google is now saying they're going to auto-correct me trying to type in the word family.
[03:02:19.195 --> 03:02:20.375]  They're saying that's a hurtful word.
[03:02:20.375 --> 03:02:21.256]  It's crazy.
[03:02:21.256 --> 03:02:22.116]  I'm not kidding.
[03:02:22.116 --> 03:02:23.597]  Well, it takes a village, right?
[03:02:23.597 --> 03:02:26.519]  We're in the middle of a total disaster, my friend.
[03:02:26.519 --> 03:02:31.802]  With all the censorship, all the controls, all the insanity, it's happening right now.
[03:02:31.802 --> 03:02:34.904]  And other people are conforming to the censorship so they don't get censored.
[03:02:34.904 --> 03:02:41.208]  Well, I'm proud to be one of the most banned censored people in world history because the truth of what I've said is going to come out one way or another.
[03:02:41.208 --> 03:02:41.808]  That's why I'm really
[03:02:42.048 --> 03:02:50.453]  I've been pleased to be on the air with you here in the great city of Chicago today to set the record straight for all the disinfo that's out there.
[03:02:50.453 --> 03:02:52.275]  I mean, you've been on my show probably 30, 40, 50 times.
[03:02:52.275 --> 03:02:55.176]  I've been on your show probably 100 times over the years.
[03:02:55.176 --> 03:02:55.817]  We've hung out.
[03:02:55.817 --> 03:02:56.858]  We've done everything.
[03:02:56.858 --> 03:02:58.459]  I mean, you've been in movies.
[03:02:58.459 --> 03:03:01.821]  It doesn't mean that when you go on the air now you're being an actor and you're being fake.
[03:03:01.821 --> 03:03:02.441]  You're a father.
[03:03:02.441 --> 03:03:03.602]  You're a patriot.
[03:03:03.602 --> 03:03:04.422]  It's the same with me.
[03:03:04.422 --> 03:03:09.286]  It's just asinine to go, oh look, Alex is in a couple movies with Keanu Reeves and
[03:03:10.226 --> 03:03:12.027]  How often do you talk to President Trump?
[03:03:12.027 --> 03:03:15.068]  Does Garrett Kushner, his son-in-law, have undue influence over him?
[03:03:27.894 --> 03:03:30.057]  Alex, Alex, that may have come off the way you didn't mean it to come off.
[03:03:47.758 --> 03:03:52.384]  To me, it sounded like you were saying African Americans should have longer sentences than white people.
[03:03:52.384 --> 03:03:53.445]  No, that's not what I said.
[03:03:53.445 --> 03:03:56.809]  Well, I know, but just, that's what I, maybe I misheard.
[03:03:56.809 --> 03:03:57.830]  And I know that's not what you meant.
[03:03:59.253 --> 03:04:02.414]  No, it's Hillary Clinton that said that black people are dogs, they need to be learned that.
[03:04:02.414 --> 03:04:04.634]  Super predators, she called them.
[03:04:04.634 --> 03:04:07.295]  Black men are super predators, she said.
[03:04:07.295 --> 03:04:08.135]  Yes, yes, yes.
[03:04:08.135 --> 03:04:22.199]  So I'm talking about she got a law passed in 93 with Bill Clinton to get black people three times the sentences of white people and Trump just reversed that and got no support or no praise from the so-called leftist black leaders, okay?
[03:04:22.199 --> 03:04:25.360]  And Trump's pulling our troops out of these countries where they've been for 18 years
[03:04:26.480 --> 03:04:31.843]  And he's not getting any praise for that from the left who now are polled in national polls.
[03:04:31.843 --> 03:04:39.327]  54% of Democrats want more wars now and more dead troops for no reason because Trump's against it.
[03:04:39.327 --> 03:04:46.390]  They have gone completely insane.
[03:04:46.390 --> 03:04:51.293]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[03:04:51.293 --> 03:04:52.754]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:04:54.281 --> 03:05:00.505]  Wars are like 12-round heavyweight boxing championship fights.
[03:05:00.505 --> 03:05:06.430]  It's about who wants it, who's prepared to go the longest, and who's ready to do the damage.
[03:05:06.430 --> 03:05:08.031]  We took on Hillary Clinton.
[03:05:08.031 --> 03:05:08.531]  We stopped her.
[03:05:08.531 --> 03:05:10.713]  We got a Nationalist in.
[03:05:10.713 --> 03:05:12.914]  Nationalists are getting elected all over the world right now.
[03:05:12.914 --> 03:05:13.835]  We are winning.
[03:05:14.813 --> 03:05:20.182]  Those of us who are at the very front line of the tip of the spear are under unprecedented attack.
[03:05:20.182 --> 03:05:25.270]  So I come to you each day and try to explain to you that this is a war of a treasure.
[03:05:25.270 --> 03:05:26.392]  This is about who wants it most.
[03:05:27.842 --> 03:05:31.365]  You know the persecution, the censorship, the sponsors they've taken, everything.
[03:05:31.365 --> 03:05:33.507]  I am in your hands, you are in my hands.
[03:05:33.507 --> 03:05:36.710]  I need financial support and I got products you and your family need.
[03:05:36.710 --> 03:05:37.831]  It's that simple.
[03:05:37.831 --> 03:05:39.272]  Thousands of great products.
[03:05:39.272 --> 03:05:45.377]  Whatever's award-winning, whatever's best-selling, what folks love, what I love, we bring it to you at InfoWarsaw.com.
[03:05:45.377 --> 03:05:53.505]  So please, go to InfoWarsaw.com today, look at all the great products, because we're in your hands, I'm in your hands, and your support is beyond critical.
[03:05:53.505 --> 03:05:53.805]  Thank you.
[03:05:55.503 --> 03:05:56.124]  We've got it.
[03:05:56.124 --> 03:06:02.632]  This transmission is coming to you.
[03:06:02.632 --> 03:06:07.037]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:06:07.037 --> 03:06:12.704]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[03:06:36.152 --> 03:06:38.655]  Is the NRA a good organization?
[03:06:38.655 --> 03:06:40.477]  I think the NRA overall is a very good organization.
[03:06:40.477 --> 03:06:42.159]  I don't think they're hardcore enough sometimes.
[03:06:42.159 --> 03:06:44.562]  But I love Ted Nugent and the work he does.
[03:06:44.562 --> 03:06:45.282]  They're on their board.
[03:06:45.282 --> 03:06:47.865]  I don't think they should ban bump stocks.
[03:06:47.865 --> 03:06:50.648]  I don't think they should restrict good people having firearms.
[03:06:50.648 --> 03:06:52.130]  They should go after criminals.
[03:06:52.130 --> 03:06:54.773]  Can Trump get re-elected if we don't have a wall?
[03:06:54.773 --> 03:06:55.414]  You know, Trump...
[03:06:56.081 --> 03:06:58.722]  Trump has made everything about this wall, and that's great.
[03:06:58.722 --> 03:07:07.745]  But I think more important than the wall is, he needs to not give all these illegal aliens amnesty that have gotten here illegally, because that only encourages more to do it.
[03:07:07.745 --> 03:07:09.206]  And, you know, they vote like 60, 70 percent.
[03:07:11.304 --> 03:07:12.825]  For Democrats.
[03:07:12.825 --> 03:07:18.527]  And so the Democrats are importing unskilled people to the country.
[03:07:18.527 --> 03:07:19.747]  It's what Trump said three years ago.
[03:07:19.747 --> 03:07:21.228]  They're not sending their doctors.
[03:07:21.228 --> 03:07:22.989]  They're not sending their scientists.
[03:07:22.989 --> 03:07:29.071]  They're sending their poorest, lowest IQ people, who've been indoctrinated into socialism.
[03:07:29.071 --> 03:07:31.752]  A lot of them are from Venezuela.
[03:07:31.752 --> 03:07:34.653]  I mean, literally communist, brainwashed people.
[03:07:34.653 --> 03:07:37.694]  And when they get here, they're coming because they want more free goodies.
[03:07:37.694 --> 03:07:39.235]  And they've already made Venezuela collapse.
[03:07:40.504 --> 03:07:49.450]  I think Trump needs to hold fast, and yes, build wall in key areas, but the media has made it about, oh, if he can't do it, he's broken his promise.
[03:07:49.450 --> 03:07:51.492]  Trump did so many of the things he said he would do.
[03:07:52.902 --> 03:07:57.806]  And, you know, he got the economy to turn back on, but then they raised interest rates seven times on him.
[03:07:57.806 --> 03:07:59.767]  They never raised interest rates under Obama.
[03:07:59.767 --> 03:08:01.509]  They did that to kill the recovery.
[03:08:01.509 --> 03:08:02.850]  Yeah, boy, it did feel like that.
[03:08:02.850 --> 03:08:10.936]  I'll tell you, I bought a few stocks and was doing quite well, and they were doing everything they could to... And who is this?
[03:08:10.936 --> 03:08:11.296]  The Fed?
[03:08:11.296 --> 03:08:13.378]  Is this, you know, to tank our economy?
[03:08:13.378 --> 03:08:16.180]  The Federal Reserve, yes.
[03:08:16.180 --> 03:08:20.724]  And who runs... Alex, who runs... The Federal Reserve, as you've explained to me, is not part of our government.
[03:08:21.528 --> 03:08:22.848]  Okay, there's two parts of the Federal Reserve.
[03:08:22.848 --> 03:08:34.591]  There's the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 that established 12 regional banks that are run by board members of other large private banks, and then they process the money and all that kind of stuff.
[03:08:34.591 --> 03:08:36.051]  That's a real function.
[03:08:36.051 --> 03:08:41.512]  But then the Federal Reserve Board of New York is another corporation in the Federal Reserve Act.
[03:08:41.512 --> 03:08:42.893]  It's privately owned, 80% foreign owned,
[03:08:44.313 --> 03:08:44.613]  Private.
[03:08:44.613 --> 03:08:44.834]  Private.
[03:08:44.834 --> 03:08:45.014]  Private.
[03:08:45.014 --> 03:08:45.854]  And how many people are part of it?
[03:08:45.854 --> 03:08:46.214]  How many people?
[03:08:46.214 --> 03:08:46.274]  Wow.
[03:09:04.526 --> 03:09:08.347]  All of our finances are controlled by these 10.
[03:09:08.347 --> 03:09:09.908]  Alex Jones joins us.
[03:09:09.908 --> 03:09:12.109]  He's a very controversial figure.
[03:09:12.109 --> 03:09:13.809]  I've spent time with him in Austin.
[03:09:13.809 --> 03:09:17.370]  We went to a few museums and had a nice steak dinner.
[03:09:17.370 --> 03:09:19.551]  Anyway, loves his kid.
[03:09:19.551 --> 03:09:20.151]  Loves his kids.
[03:09:20.151 --> 03:09:21.152]  Talks about his kids.
[03:09:21.152 --> 03:09:22.572]  Family man.
[03:09:22.572 --> 03:09:23.432]  Does amp up.
[03:09:23.432 --> 03:09:24.913]  This is somewhat of what
[03:09:26.241 --> 03:09:28.562]  Alex, are you allowed to talk about any of this or would you like to not talk about it?
[03:09:49.125 --> 03:09:49.986]  I can talk about it.
[03:09:49.986 --> 03:10:08.337]  I don't want to I don't want to betray anything that was set off the record but were you were you amazed at at your wife I mean breaking ranks with you and I don't know how to say it but talking with the enemy like so gleefully cheering for your demise and really trying to hurt you
[03:10:08.777 --> 03:10:10.818]  I mean, this was a woman you loved, you had children with.
[03:10:10.818 --> 03:10:12.699]  Was this a shocking development to you?
[03:10:12.699 --> 03:10:15.000]  I mean, were you amazed at how low it went?
[03:10:15.000 --> 03:10:21.043]  Well, I think of the annals of nasty divorces, it's a record breaker, and it's all on record.
[03:10:21.043 --> 03:10:23.704]  I didn't say anything bad about her, and I'm not going to say anything bad about her.
[03:10:23.704 --> 03:10:30.027]  But there was basically no bottom to the things that were said and done, and none of it was true.
[03:10:30.027 --> 03:10:31.227]  Why, Alex?
[03:10:31.227 --> 03:10:32.268]  Why the vitriol from her?
[03:10:33.198 --> 03:10:37.381]  Um, you know, she, she filed for divorce on me.
[03:10:37.381 --> 03:10:42.505]  And, uh, you know, she had a boyfriend and, uh, that was just basically it.
[03:10:42.505 --> 03:10:45.707]  And then she tried to get me back, uh, like six months into it.
[03:10:45.707 --> 03:10:46.948]  And I said, no.
[03:10:46.948 --> 03:10:49.009]  And that's when, you know, she was the scorn of a woman.
[03:10:49.009 --> 03:10:55.373]  Uh, you know, like Shakespeare talked about, the Bible talks about it, uh, hell have no fury like a woman scorned.
[03:10:55.373 --> 03:10:56.814]  And, you know, she begged me to get back with her.
[03:10:56.814 --> 03:11:00.237]  And I had a girlfriend by then and was quite frankly happy to be moved out of the house.
[03:11:01.215 --> 03:11:05.401]  Uh, and you know, right around that time then there were some issues and I got full custody of the kids.
[03:11:05.401 --> 03:11:06.903]  I don't want to get into it.
[03:11:06.903 --> 03:11:08.385]  Uh, but let's just say, you know, I pray for
[03:11:09.381 --> 03:11:14.963]  And, uh, you know, it seems like she kind of had a breakdown, and I just want her to, you know, get better and, you know, just be happy.
[03:11:14.963 --> 03:11:21.426]  And, uh, you know, she's, you know, she's cooled off from about an 11, you know, spinal tap level.
[03:11:21.426 --> 03:11:28.529]  She's cooled off from about an 11 to about a 3 right now, which most people would call that 3, just volcanically hateful and angry.
[03:11:28.529 --> 03:11:33.551]  Uh, but, uh, actually, you know, she's actually a wonderful person compared to the way she was now.
[03:11:34.011 --> 03:11:35.992]  You talk about gods and demons.
[03:11:35.992 --> 03:11:38.093]  Do you believe that's what we're fighting against here?
[03:11:38.093 --> 03:11:40.513]  I mean, do you believe that we're having a battle on Earth right now?
[03:11:40.513 --> 03:11:44.135]  Do you really believe that it's clear-cut, that it's good versus evil?
[03:11:44.135 --> 03:11:44.735]  Well, I'll tell you this.
[03:11:44.735 --> 03:11:49.557]  I've always been a Christian, and I believe in God, and I've had spiritual experiences in life.
[03:11:49.557 --> 03:11:53.938]  But, you know, I'm a worldly guy, and I kind of got away from God for a while.
[03:11:53.938 --> 03:11:55.179]  Where are you now?
[03:11:55.179 --> 03:12:01.301]  Well, in the last six, seven years, when I got really close to God, I started talking about Jesus Christ on air and things like that.
[03:12:01.301 --> 03:12:03.082]  That's when all hell broke loose.
[03:12:03.722 --> 03:12:07.585]  And you'll find out when you really start telling people it's a fight between good and evil at the end of the day.
[03:12:07.585 --> 03:12:11.268]  You know, just worry about your kid's spiritual future, not so much their grades.
[03:12:11.268 --> 03:12:12.890]  And I'm not saying that's not important.
[03:12:12.890 --> 03:12:17.874]  Worry about your own spiritual future and know that there really are all these dimensions we can't see.
[03:12:17.874 --> 03:12:21.036]  It's been proven, all these mathematicians that were atheists now say no.
[03:12:21.036 --> 03:12:25.380]  We believe that some other system has created an artificial dimension.
[03:12:25.380 --> 03:12:31.865]  They've got all these devices and spectrometers and things that can measure that there's a more powerful outside force
[03:12:32.802 --> 03:12:38.647]  Holding this universe together, and there are lower dimensions and higher dimensions, and there's free will in the universe.
[03:12:38.647 --> 03:12:43.310]  There's a lot of entities, a lot of creatures, a lot of things that we can't even see.
[03:12:43.310 --> 03:12:48.774]  We only see a limited part of the visual light spectrum.
[03:12:48.774 --> 03:12:53.918]  And they've proven that there's just all sorts of stuff we can't even understand, energetically going on.
[03:12:53.918 --> 03:12:59.162]  And at the end of the day, when I talk about how there are, from my own research and what the globalists believe,
[03:12:59.782 --> 03:13:04.963]  The globalists believe that they're contacting basically interdimensional aliens.
[03:13:04.963 --> 03:13:08.344]  That's what we call demons, and that they're giving them advanced knowledge.
[03:13:08.344 --> 03:13:10.725]  That's what all the ancients said when they would do black magic and things.
[03:13:10.725 --> 03:13:17.867]  They were getting, you know, Aleister Crowley, he was in the pyramids, you know, conjuring demons and people that were with him, so they look like little gray aliens.
[03:13:17.867 --> 03:13:19.287]  And it's just really, really crazy stuff.
[03:13:19.287 --> 03:13:22.348]  And then they're basically giving advanced technology
[03:13:23.101 --> 03:13:35.237]  Through the ether to the Silicon Valley people who take all these drugs and do all these rituals to then get what they call divine inspiration through the space-time interdimensional gate.
[03:13:35.237 --> 03:13:40.124]  And then these demons are basically giving us technology and systems that we then build that will end up destroying us.
[03:13:42.055 --> 03:13:47.738]  Can the good side, can the godly folks, tap into that same power through angels?
[03:13:47.738 --> 03:13:50.058]  Absolutely, and that's what they don't want us to do.
[03:13:50.058 --> 03:13:52.439]  And listen, I didn't used to believe this.
[03:13:52.439 --> 03:13:56.401]  Then when I started studying deeply what the globalists are into, from their own internal documents,
[03:13:57.199 --> 03:13:58.341]  That's when they got really pissed.
[03:13:58.341 --> 03:14:06.710]  And like when I went on Joe Rogan's show for two hours a couple years ago and talked about this, and it was his most downloaded podcast, I mean all sorts of hell broke loose over that.
[03:14:06.710 --> 03:14:09.053]  Elon Musk went on and basically said I was right about everything.
[03:14:09.053 --> 03:14:14.520]  And then when he goes to these big billionaire conferences, they are literally doing rituals.
[03:14:14.520 --> 03:14:17.043]  They believe being contacted what they call the clockwork elves.
[03:14:17.663 --> 03:14:27.830]  And everybody that basically takes the DMT that your body releases during death and also the deepest sleep, it opens up a dimensional gate and people are there.
[03:14:27.830 --> 03:14:38.217]  So atheists are all becoming not atheists anymore because they're literally basically on spaceships in another dimension or on some type of craft with these guys.
[03:14:38.217 --> 03:14:39.978]  Sometimes you're strapped down on a table.
[03:14:39.978 --> 03:14:41.739]  Sometimes they torture the hell out of you.
[03:14:41.739 --> 03:14:44.361]  I mean, but that's what's happening when you take DMT and ayahuasca
[03:14:45.341 --> 03:14:48.562]  Is that it's opening up a dimension in your brain.
[03:14:48.562 --> 03:14:51.963]  Your brain is able to go to the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th dimension.
[03:14:51.963 --> 03:14:55.264]  And so you're opening up other dimensions, including lower dimensions.
[03:14:55.264 --> 03:14:56.544]  And some really bad stuff happens.
[03:14:56.544 --> 03:14:58.945]  I want to explain something.
[03:14:58.945 --> 03:14:59.185]  Yes.
[03:14:59.185 --> 03:15:01.406]  This is what the establishment believes.
[03:15:01.406 --> 03:15:07.427]  This is what the CIA was funding with the Unabomber and other people.
[03:15:07.427 --> 03:15:10.568]  Are you talking about MKUltra and things like this?
[03:15:10.568 --> 03:15:12.249]  Yes, all of it.
[03:15:12.249 --> 03:15:13.569]  We always think of contacting aliens.
[03:15:14.611 --> 03:15:14.991]  Alex.
[03:15:14.991 --> 03:15:15.071]  Alex.
[03:15:53.424 --> 03:15:54.645]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:15:54.645 --> 03:15:58.566]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:15:58.566 --> 03:16:00.107]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:16:00.107 --> 03:16:03.069]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:16:03.069 --> 03:16:08.631]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:16:08.631 --> 03:16:09.832]  I can help you, too.
[03:16:09.832 --> 03:16:12.773]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.

[03:16:22.998 --> 03:16:29.343]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[03:16:29.343 --> 03:16:32.385]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[03:16:32.385 --> 03:16:38.309]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[03:16:38.309 --> 03:16:42.092]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[03:16:42.092 --> 03:16:43.372]  Was there ever a vote?
[03:16:43.372 --> 03:16:44.713]  Who do we fight for?
[03:16:44.713 --> 03:16:50.918]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[03:16:50.918 --> 03:16:52.359]  Available at Amazon Books.
[03:16:53.063 --> 03:16:56.645]  The pain in my neck, back, and shoulders has really gotten worse.

[03:19:57.260 --> 03:19:59.882]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:22.123 --> 03:20:28.130]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones.
[03:20:28.130 --> 03:20:29.372]  Move, bitch!
[03:20:29.372 --> 03:20:32.215]  Get out the way!
[03:20:32.215 --> 03:20:35.779]  We pledge allegiance to one flag, and that flag
[03:20:36.700 --> 03:20:38.701]  The American flag is the American flag!
[03:20:38.701 --> 03:20:42.803]  Infowars helped fuel the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[03:20:42.803 --> 03:20:46.325]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[03:20:46.325 --> 03:20:47.766]  I will not let you down.
[03:20:47.766 --> 03:20:50.907]  You'll be very, very impressed, I hope.
[03:20:50.907 --> 03:20:53.729]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[03:20:53.729 --> 03:20:55.430]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[03:20:55.430 --> 03:21:00.872]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[03:21:00.872 --> 03:21:02.873]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:21:02.873 --> 03:21:03.854]  It's Alex Jones!
[03:21:05.552 --> 03:21:07.954]  I did an ayahuasca ceremony last year.
[03:21:07.954 --> 03:21:08.974]  I did several of them.
[03:21:08.974 --> 03:21:09.455]  And what happened?
[03:21:09.455 --> 03:21:11.156]  Did you see a spirit animal?
[03:21:11.156 --> 03:21:13.517]  Uh, you know, I think I did.
[03:21:13.517 --> 03:21:15.719]  And they, you know, all kinds of things.
[03:21:15.719 --> 03:21:22.843]  I will tell you that maybe 49 people, I think, and I was the one guy that didn't think it was God.
[03:21:22.843 --> 03:21:26.365]  I thought it was a chemical reaction to this vine.
[03:21:26.365 --> 03:21:29.187]  But everybody else had very profound... I saw profound things.
[03:21:29.187 --> 03:21:31.289]  I mean, I was at my father's deathbed.
[03:21:31.289 --> 03:21:32.750]  And I mean, I was there.
[03:21:33.849 --> 03:21:36.311]  Uh, in every sense of the... It was like a holodeck.
[03:21:36.311 --> 03:21:38.493]  You talk about Elon Musk and his thoughts of you.
[03:21:38.493 --> 03:21:44.837]  I'd like to know... You know, he says we're in a hologram right now, that we're living in a holographic universe.
[03:21:44.837 --> 03:21:48.320]  Uh, like the holodeck on Star Trek, to make it stupid simple.
[03:21:48.320 --> 03:21:50.542]  Uh, is that what you think we're in right now?
[03:21:50.542 --> 03:21:58.708]  This is a real third-dimensional flesh-and-blood simulation created by God.
[03:21:58.708 --> 03:22:01.350]  And so... Let me break this down.
[03:22:02.669 --> 03:22:10.693]  We are basically composite creatures where we have our consciousness and our soul, okay?
[03:22:10.693 --> 03:22:11.374]  That is eternal.
[03:22:11.374 --> 03:22:27.642]  But then if you look at the body, this is a scientific fact, we are electrochemically and genetically connected to all of our ancestors, wherever they came from, going all the way back into the ends of creation and the start of everything, whatever that really was.
[03:22:27.642 --> 03:22:30.844]  And so we are a genetic composite of all of those people
[03:22:31.698 --> 03:22:31.938]  That's
[03:22:51.408 --> 03:22:56.470]  Like a coral reef or a system, a communal system.
[03:22:56.470 --> 03:22:59.671]  You know, like jellyfish aren't one creature.
[03:22:59.671 --> 03:23:02.352]  It's a whole bunch of cells in a colony.
[03:23:02.352 --> 03:23:05.994]  And so our bodies are genetic time-traveling colonies.
[03:23:06.634 --> 03:23:07.334]  Do we go to heaven?
[03:23:07.334 --> 03:23:07.774]  Is there a soul?
[03:23:07.774 --> 03:23:09.835]  Yes, if you choose God, and God's at the top,
[03:23:33.181 --> 03:23:43.343]  Then you ascend through that and it's basically like a light bridge or it looks like a waterfall and you have to basically swim up it and the space-time continuum.
[03:23:43.343 --> 03:23:48.844]  But you have to be loving, be good, be strong, be honorable and not resonate with the dark.
[03:23:48.844 --> 03:23:53.925]  If you resonate with the dark, then you start basically going back down.
[03:23:53.925 --> 03:23:57.626]  I mean, I would use the analogy of first man, which is a true story, with
[03:23:59.068 --> 03:24:00.250]  We're good.
[03:24:11.670 --> 03:24:16.513]  Or he was about to keep bouncing on the atmosphere and then go back down to Earth.
[03:24:16.513 --> 03:24:25.779]  But instead of, if you use a spiritual allegory, Neil Armstrong would have gone to heaven if he kept going into space, and would have gone to hell if he went back down to Earth.
[03:24:25.779 --> 03:24:31.563]  But at the third dimensional level, he would have died if he kept going into space, and he lived by getting back in the atmosphere and going back down to Earth.
[03:24:31.563 --> 03:24:34.105]  So it's basically like that, and we're in a purgatory.
[03:24:34.865 --> 03:24:35.766]  We're good to go.
[03:24:49.893 --> 03:24:52.276]  Alex, look, we've all heard, and I think it's dangerous,
[03:25:06.832 --> 03:25:07.813]  And I don't want to know what you think.
[03:25:07.813 --> 03:25:10.174]  And again, Alex and I don't agree on everything.
[03:25:10.174 --> 03:25:11.575]  I'm letting the man talk.
[03:25:11.575 --> 03:25:15.677]  And I have different theories as well, but I'm not here to talk to me.
[03:25:15.677 --> 03:25:16.938]  I want to hear what Alex has to say.
[03:25:16.938 --> 03:25:20.340]  But, you know, people that say, you know, we're God.
[03:25:20.340 --> 03:25:21.980]  We're God.
[03:25:21.980 --> 03:25:23.821]  And that always creeps me out.
[03:25:23.821 --> 03:25:27.163]  And I hear it more and more from people, this idea that we're God.
[03:25:27.163 --> 03:25:28.484]  I don't think I'm God, Alex.
[03:25:28.484 --> 03:25:30.105]  I think I'm creation.
[03:25:30.105 --> 03:25:34.327]  It's like the Frankenstein monster is in Frankenstein.
[03:25:34.327 --> 03:25:35.128]  Are you God, Alex?
[03:25:36.124 --> 03:25:42.050]  No, see, you're strong-minded, you're a Christian, so you went and saw your father because he meant so much to you.
[03:25:42.050 --> 03:25:54.222]  You, in that space-time continuum, expanding your perception, not your consciousness, but expanding your conscious awareness of just how large the universe really is.
[03:25:54.222 --> 03:25:56.364]  You spent that time to go back and see your father.
[03:25:56.364 --> 03:25:57.325]  You spent that time
[03:25:57.705 --> 03:25:59.746]  to try to reflect on your family.
[03:25:59.746 --> 03:26:07.771]  Other people see the matrix system around them and they get on a power trip and they say, this is God and I'm God.
[03:26:07.771 --> 03:26:10.393]  Once they now realize there really is a God, that's what I'm saying.
[03:26:10.393 --> 03:26:16.457]  They go from being atheist to going, Oh, I'm a God, the shamans here with me.
[03:26:16.457 --> 03:26:19.059]  And now this group that's inducted me into this.
[03:26:19.059 --> 03:26:20.940]  And then that's how you get into the real occult.
[03:26:20.940 --> 03:26:21.140]  Okay.
[03:26:21.340 --> 03:26:24.482]  And then all of that ends up leading into black magic and satanism.
[03:26:24.482 --> 03:26:32.026]  And that's why they use these shaman and people who mean well at many levels to get people inducted into it.
[03:26:32.026 --> 03:26:37.228]  And then they basically get recruited to Aleister Crowley type cults once you get back to the United States and Europe.
[03:26:37.228 --> 03:26:45.893]  And then now that you've opened your brain up to all this, then like, you know, sharks to blood, the first few times people usually don't see the really bad stuff.
[03:26:45.893 --> 03:26:46.393]  But once you
[03:26:47.934 --> 03:26:57.996]  Once you uncloak, and once you can see what's past the veil, now they can see you, and now you keep doing very bad things.
[03:26:57.996 --> 03:27:07.338]  Start coming up through the lower dimensions, swimming up like sharks to eat, you know, somebody floating on the surface in a tube or something.
[03:27:07.338 --> 03:27:15.320]  And they'll usually, if they think they can trick you and you're already basically predisposed to think you're God, they'll then present themselves
[03:27:16.346 --> 03:27:23.209]  Generally like an elf or a beautiful woman or maybe a tall Nordic is how these demons like to present themselves.
[03:27:23.209 --> 03:27:27.050]  And they'll tell you how you're God and how all... Alex!
[03:27:27.050 --> 03:27:27.670]  Alex!
[03:27:27.670 --> 03:27:28.211]  Alex!
[03:27:28.211 --> 03:27:33.412]  They appear at the edge, you know, when I did it, they appear at the edge of the jungle.
[03:27:33.412 --> 03:27:40.155]  Now, I didn't have this for me, but they appear at the edge of the jungle and they welcome you in and I actually have audio.
[03:27:40.155 --> 03:27:42.076]  This is the actual audio from my
[03:27:43.562 --> 03:28:09.111]  Ayahuasca ceremony in Costa Rica And I did see something outside of I mean I saw a guy that was just absolutely Vibrating in and out of something very frightening and in fact not only did I see it Everybody saw it and got away from this guy who was very dark natured and very scary And
[03:28:13.186 --> 03:28:15.147]  There were people that saw things that were so horrific.
[03:28:15.147 --> 03:28:26.572]  I, again, and again, I think it was a chemical reaction in the brain, but, and I don't know that I put anything spiritual to it, but I did, I did, I mean, the sights, the sounds, the smells, everything.
[03:28:26.572 --> 03:28:30.654]  I was, I was back in time at my father's deathbed of cancer.
[03:28:31.585 --> 03:28:39.449]  Alex, over the years I've had people contact me, and I have an incredible nose for BS.
[03:28:39.449 --> 03:28:41.630]  I think I can tell when someone's BSing me.
[03:28:41.630 --> 03:28:44.852]  I can tell immediately when someone calls my radio show and they're gonna mess with me.
[03:28:44.852 --> 03:28:45.652]  I can feel it.
[03:28:45.652 --> 03:28:46.493]  I can sense it.
[03:28:46.493 --> 03:28:46.953]  Mighty sense.

[03:31:53.992 --> 03:32:03.298]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[03:32:03.298 --> 03:32:06.160]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[03:32:06.160 --> 03:32:12.205]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[03:32:12.865 --> 03:32:19.129]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source, and the Globels tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[03:32:19.129 --> 03:32:25.434]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[03:32:25.434 --> 03:32:32.378]  Now, due to the Establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[03:32:33.499 --> 03:32:35.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:33:10.482 --> 03:33:13.809]  You are either with the Republic or against it.
[03:33:13.809 --> 03:33:18.820]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[03:33:18.820 --> 03:33:20.483]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:30.424 --> 03:33:36.229]  You and I both have interviewed a fascinating man named David Icke, and you know where I'm going with this.
[03:33:36.229 --> 03:33:49.461]  And as I was doing this ayahuasca, which is a vine, and I saw this guy vibrating in and out of a human form, I was reminded of David Icke and people that have contacted me over the years, and many of them terrified.
[03:33:49.461 --> 03:33:50.442]  In fact, one of the biggest
[03:33:51.343 --> 03:34:00.391]  Ministers on earth I talked to about this and he said you know I thought this stuff was crazy until I was in prison talking to a guy and I saw I Saw his face shift.
[03:34:00.391 --> 03:34:01.972]  I saw a change and again.
[03:34:01.972 --> 03:34:07.457]  I've had many people I I got offered serious money to write a book about this.
[03:34:07.457 --> 03:34:10.099]  I did years of research on this and in fact
[03:34:11.360 --> 03:34:15.263]  A major company even optioned it to possibly make a movie out of it.
[03:34:15.263 --> 03:34:22.068]  And the more I got into it, it was so dark and I thought so dangerous that I didn't want to go any deeper.
[03:34:22.068 --> 03:34:24.750]  And you've been ridiculed a lot for talking about these things.
[03:34:24.750 --> 03:34:32.095]  And so I don't put anyone on my show to make them look bad, but you have been outspoken about it.
[03:34:32.095 --> 03:34:33.696]  Are we talking about shapeshifters here?
[03:34:34.488 --> 03:34:37.991]  Well, Mancow, listen to me very carefully because this is very dangerous what we're talking about.
[03:34:37.991 --> 03:34:40.633]  And people listening need to understand this is not a game.
[03:34:40.633 --> 03:34:44.396]  It's not a chemical reaction, Mancow, when you all see the same thing.
[03:34:44.396 --> 03:34:49.099]  The drug opens up the gateway in the brain to other dimensions.
[03:34:49.099 --> 03:34:49.880]  And I told you
[03:34:50.854 --> 03:34:53.435]  Really serious, evil, demonic stuff can swim up.
[03:34:53.435 --> 03:34:59.337]  A lot of people go to these rituals who are already heavily into it to actually suck energy off everybody else.
[03:34:59.337 --> 03:35:04.298]  And I think this guy I saw changing, I think he was demonic for real.
[03:35:04.298 --> 03:35:10.000]  And listen, Billy Corgan has been very open about it, seeing a woman shift.
[03:35:10.740 --> 03:35:14.063]  Uh, saw her eyes go completely black, and I, and that's, is that a different thing?
[03:35:14.063 --> 03:35:16.304]  People, their eyes go... No, it's not a different thing.
[03:35:16.304 --> 03:35:17.405]  Completely black.
[03:35:17.405 --> 03:35:28.974]  Let me just, I want to tell people quickly, that over the years, and I'm going back to the mid-1980s, I've had people call, and they were, I'm talking to my girlfriend, I'm at wherever, and their eyes went completely black.
[03:35:28.974 --> 03:35:29.595]  What's happening?
[03:35:30.919 --> 03:35:32.180]  I want to explain something.
[03:35:32.180 --> 03:35:34.402]  You say, oh, you're being controversial or I'm being controversial.
[03:35:34.402 --> 03:35:41.348]  We're telling people what Hollywood and what the billionaires and the tech people are obsessed with.
[03:35:41.348 --> 03:35:43.310]  This is all they do.
[03:35:43.310 --> 03:35:45.432]  They're on drugs multiple days of the week.
[03:35:45.432 --> 03:35:46.613]  It's mainstream news.
[03:35:46.613 --> 03:35:48.735]  They're not just micro dosing LSD.
[03:35:48.735 --> 03:35:54.119]  They've got a bunch of other synthetic stuff way beyond ayahuasca, way beyond DMT.
[03:35:54.119 --> 03:35:54.920]  And I'm telling you,
[03:35:55.788 --> 03:35:58.750]  I'm telling you, it's like a trip to the universe.
[03:35:58.750 --> 03:36:05.195]  Some people want to contact entities that basically operate like aliens and give them advanced blueprints for technology.
[03:36:05.195 --> 03:36:09.518]  That's what San Francisco is, a research base contacting aliens for U.S.
[03:36:09.518 --> 03:36:10.559]  advanced weapons research.
[03:36:10.559 --> 03:36:12.280]  And that's what they believe they're doing.
[03:36:12.280 --> 03:36:19.785]  I was told about this when I was a kid because I had some family that had friends that were in advanced research projects with DARPA out in San Francisco.
[03:36:19.785 --> 03:36:22.928]  I heard this at the dinner table when I was like eight years old, okay?
[03:36:22.928 --> 03:36:24.309]  Okay, Alex, Alex?
[03:36:25.582 --> 03:36:40.069]  I was in San Francisco, I broadcast at the Norwood Show for years, and I also heard these stories that they talk to very creepy greys, is what military people have told me, and that they don't know if they're good or bad.
[03:36:40.069 --> 03:36:41.790]  The feeling that many get is they're sinister.
[03:36:41.790 --> 03:36:47.312]  Yes, yes, yes, the Presidio and the whole area is the contact zone.
[03:36:47.312 --> 03:36:51.114]  Now listen, people, you have to understand something, this is not my opinion.
[03:36:51.114 --> 03:36:53.415]  This is what San Francisco elite believe.
[03:36:54.139 --> 03:36:55.559]  So you can say it's a chemical reaction.
[03:36:55.559 --> 03:37:11.242]  Okay, what is it in our brain that a bunch of people get together in a city and take a bunch of advanced drugs to be in contact with aliens, and they do it enough that then people that do this enough can actually start shifting themselves because it's taking over this dimension.
[03:37:11.242 --> 03:37:11.983]  And that's what this is.
[03:37:11.983 --> 03:37:15.943]  This is an alien invasion through the computers, through the smartphones, through everything.
[03:37:15.943 --> 03:37:17.104]  That's the big secret.
[03:37:17.104 --> 03:37:19.824]  And as soon as I started talking about that, that's when they took me off here.
[03:37:19.824 --> 03:37:21.184]  They're like, uh-uh.
[03:37:21.184 --> 03:37:23.625]  And they'll never—actually, they never attacked me for this.
[03:37:24.750 --> 03:37:26.971]  They do not touch this, my friend.
[03:37:26.971 --> 03:37:28.631]  Because that's the big truth.
[03:37:28.631 --> 03:37:30.412]  They didn't come from space.
[03:37:30.412 --> 03:37:34.394]  They came through a dimensional gate in our brains.
[03:37:34.394 --> 03:37:35.634]  Of course they would.
[03:37:35.634 --> 03:37:40.056]  And so now, the big hot thing with Joe Rogan and all these self-help groups.
[03:37:40.056 --> 03:37:42.417]  I'm not even saying Joe's a bad guy, but he promotes it.
[03:37:42.417 --> 03:37:44.778]  That's just like the LSD in Timothy Leary.
[03:37:44.778 --> 03:37:45.678]  He admits working for the CIA.
[03:37:48.075 --> 03:37:52.497]  In the 60s and 70s, to promote that to young people in the psychedelic revolution.
[03:37:52.497 --> 03:38:02.580]  Now they're going into the next phase, getting everybody to go to these big retreats, and the police turn a blind eye, even in places like Texas where it's illegal, and everybody takes ayahuasca.
[03:38:02.580 --> 03:38:09.783]  And then, ooh, there's always somebody there that runs into something dark, and, oh, there's some light over here, and people are then tricked into the whole deal.
[03:38:11.505 --> 03:38:12.526]  And that's what goes on.
[03:38:12.526 --> 03:38:16.288]  It's all energetic, interdimensional.
[03:38:16.288 --> 03:38:19.650]  I went to a place, you can look it up, I went to a place called Rhythmia.
[03:38:19.650 --> 03:38:23.232]  I had a doctor and nurses to keep an eye on me.
[03:38:23.232 --> 03:38:25.834]  I wouldn't do this stuff in somebody's apartment.
[03:38:25.834 --> 03:38:28.075]  I've been offered to do that, you know, to do that as well.
[03:38:28.075 --> 03:38:29.336]  It's a very hip thing right now.
[03:38:29.336 --> 03:38:30.537]  I tried it.
[03:38:30.537 --> 03:38:32.378]  I don't recommend it.
[03:38:32.378 --> 03:38:33.758]  I didn't need to do it.
[03:38:33.758 --> 03:38:37.100]  And I, yeah, all that happened to me was I had very vivid
[03:38:38.226 --> 03:38:40.708]  Memories from my past.
[03:38:40.708 --> 03:38:42.569]  Some good, some were negative.
[03:38:42.569 --> 03:38:46.011]  Other people were so shaken that they were terrified.
[03:38:46.011 --> 03:38:47.191]  So I know what you're saying.
[03:38:47.191 --> 03:38:54.015]  That's because, man, you're an accomplished, smart guy with a strong family and a Christian, so you have a shield up around you.
[03:38:54.015 --> 03:38:59.659]  And I'm telling you, people that don't have God and who don't have that tie, that higher dimension, they're wide open.
[03:39:00.399 --> 03:39:05.802]  Alex, hang on, because we're running out of time and I want to make sure I get to this.
[03:39:05.802 --> 03:39:14.386]  All this hydrogen collider and all of this, are they trying to break through other dimensions to unleash literally hell on earth right now?
[03:39:14.386 --> 03:39:16.748]  Is there an effort to do that?
[03:39:16.748 --> 03:39:18.909]  I know this.
[03:39:18.909 --> 03:39:21.390]  The scientists admit that they could create something called a strangelet.
[03:39:22.176 --> 03:39:33.541]  Which you basically see in a science fiction Star Trek came out a few years ago where there's a mining ship and he injects the quote red matter in the middle of the planet and it makes it turn into a black hole.
[03:39:33.541 --> 03:39:34.121]  Okay.
[03:39:34.121 --> 03:39:34.562]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:39:34.562 --> 03:39:37.563]  Science is trying to create a black hole into other dimensions.
[03:39:37.563 --> 03:39:39.644]  Is that what's going on right now?
[03:39:39.644 --> 03:39:44.546]  Well, that's just what I'm telling you is what the Hadrian scientists admit.
[03:39:44.546 --> 03:39:48.668]  That they could create a black hole, they could create a strangelet and they're trying to find new particles
[03:39:49.440 --> 03:40:01.922]  They're trying to find particles that they basically slam different radioactive protons and heavy metals into each other.
[03:40:03.064 --> 03:40:11.271]  At beyond light speed in an attempt to then isolate new particles that have never been before discovered.
[03:40:11.271 --> 03:40:15.555]  And of course those particles will be bouncing off, they believe, and coming out of another dimension.
[03:40:15.555 --> 03:40:25.243]  So yes, they are literally using giant cyclotrons, is what they're really called, giant cyclotrons to do this.
[03:40:25.243 --> 03:40:27.606]  This ceremony that the world had,
[03:40:28.286 --> 03:40:31.408]  It's some of the most bizarre footage I've ever seen in my entire life.
[03:40:31.408 --> 03:40:35.209]  If I wanted to direct people listening to us right now to see that, how is it labeled?
[03:40:35.209 --> 03:40:37.991]  How could someone find it on the internet?
[03:40:37.991 --> 03:40:39.151]  What ceremony is that?
[03:40:39.151 --> 03:40:42.433]  They dug this big hole and they had a big ceremony.
[03:40:42.433 --> 03:40:49.296]  And there's all kinds of people dressed as demons and all the leaders from the world are there and... Oh, I remember this.
[03:40:49.296 --> 03:40:50.877]  Oh yeah.
[03:40:50.877 --> 03:40:51.897]  It should have been 2001.
[03:40:53.658 --> 03:41:03.561]  But it was in the year 2000, it was in the year 2000, and it was supposedly the last day of that millennium, new day of the next millennium, even though it really wasn't.
[03:41:03.561 --> 03:41:19.026]  And PBS, PBS was going around the world, and they were at the Great Pyramid, they were also going to France, and I was just sitting there watching, and I recorded it on VHS, back then it was VHS, and they were going, we love you, anti-beast.
[03:41:19.026 --> 03:41:21.387]  Come into our dimension, anti-beast.
[03:41:22.106 --> 03:41:28.790]  And then they were just cutting to like, you know, 200-foot demons and huge... No, no, this is great what you're talking about.
[03:41:28.790 --> 03:41:30.752]  No, what I'm talking about, I mean, that's fascinating.
[03:41:30.752 --> 03:41:36.976]  What I was talking about was they had, there was a giant hole, and they were having this big celebration, this giant hole they had built.
[03:41:37.796 --> 03:41:40.198]  It was like a couple of years ago.
[03:41:40.198 --> 03:41:44.741]  And some people say they captured at this party a sacrifice of someone being killed.
[03:41:44.741 --> 03:41:48.244]  You see people in robes, and it looks like they kill a woman.
[03:41:48.244 --> 03:41:51.486]  Let me tell you, they do a lot of this stuff right out in the open.
[03:41:51.486 --> 03:41:52.467]  That gives them more power, they think.
[03:41:52.467 --> 03:42:00.253]  But listen, I got invited by the widow of the biggest name in rock and roll.
[03:42:00.253 --> 03:42:01.634]  I mean, I think you can say the biggest.
[03:42:01.634 --> 03:42:03.255]  Everybody can probably guess who I'm talking about.
[03:42:05.257 --> 03:42:23.463]  They were trying to get me, and I'm not saying they're bad, I'm not saying they're good, but just in hindsight, they were really calling me, talking to me a lot, and trying to, also the son of the person who contacted me, and trying to get me on their private jet to go to this event in Reykjavik.
[03:42:24.168 --> 03:42:25.069]  Uh, to do a ritual.
[03:42:25.069 --> 03:42:27.470]  This is like six, seven years ago.
[03:42:27.470 --> 03:42:32.893]  To fire the real, like, Lucifer beam into space and try to bring in the real New Age and all this.
[03:42:32.893 --> 03:42:34.454]  And I said, you know, no thanks.
[03:42:34.454 --> 03:42:40.977]  I don't think I'm gonna be doing that.
[03:42:40.977 --> 03:42:45.860]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[03:42:45.860 --> 03:42:47.121]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:42:47.121 --> 03:42:48.121]  It's 2 AM.
[03:42:48.121 --> 03:42:50.363]  The figure is gone.
[03:43:02.492 --> 03:43:11.495]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[03:43:11.495 --> 03:43:21.579]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[03:43:21.579 --> 03:43:30.102]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[03:43:30.942 --> 03:43:32.283]  There's nothing else like it.
[03:43:32.283 --> 03:43:33.443]  You must experience it.
[03:43:33.443 --> 03:43:35.384]  It is a total game-changer.
[03:43:35.384 --> 03:43:40.446]  And it comes in easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[03:43:40.446 --> 03:43:41.966]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[03:43:41.966 --> 03:43:43.447]  It lasts 10 hours.
[03:43:43.447 --> 03:43:50.129]  So take a half packet the first time you take it, because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[03:43:50.129 --> 03:43:51.610]  TurboForce at m4slive.com.

[03:45:55.644 --> 03:46:00.366]  Hard-working Americans need high-quality energy when they're on the run.
[03:46:00.366 --> 03:46:10.810]  And ladies and gentlemen, we have spent years working with top developers to come out with the highest quality protein bar in vanilla coconut and chocolate peanut butter at InfoWarsLife.com.

[03:46:40.267 --> 03:46:41.968]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:47:15.834 --> 03:47:25.176]  This is the end, beautiful friend.
[03:47:25.176 --> 03:47:29.697]  This is the end, my only friend.
[03:47:29.697 --> 03:47:32.097]  No, Alex, this will drive me insane.
[03:47:32.097 --> 03:47:34.158]  And as soon as we're done talking, I'm going to remember it.
[03:47:34.158 --> 03:47:36.858]  It was a giant tunnel that they're building.
[03:47:36.858 --> 03:47:38.959]  And it may have been in Helsinki.
[03:47:38.959 --> 03:47:41.059]  And they had a giant party to celebrate this.
[03:47:42.722 --> 03:47:45.743]  I mean, I remember there was a big tunnel over in L.C.
[03:47:45.743 --> 03:47:48.704]  that the big bus and the kids all crashed into and died.
[03:47:48.704 --> 03:47:49.944]  Listen, listen.
[03:47:49.944 --> 03:47:59.488]  Francois Mitterrand got the big glass pyramid that Macron was sworn in on front of.
[03:47:59.488 --> 03:48:02.008]  In front of the Louvre?
[03:48:02.008 --> 03:48:03.149]  I was just there.
[03:48:03.149 --> 03:48:04.849]  I was just there.
[03:48:04.849 --> 03:48:06.830]  666 pieces of glass.
[03:48:06.830 --> 03:48:07.210]  Right.
[03:48:07.210 --> 03:48:09.891]  And he pledged it to Lucifer and that was in the newspaper.
[03:48:10.776 --> 03:48:13.759]  Well, how about Christian Bale thanking Satan?
[03:48:13.759 --> 03:48:17.722]  I mean, ha ha, but is good winning?
[03:48:17.722 --> 03:48:19.464]  What's happening right now, Alex?
[03:48:19.464 --> 03:48:23.888]  If you're keeping score, and I know you are, are the good guys winning or losing right now?
[03:48:23.888 --> 03:48:28.472]  Or is it just the illusion that evil is winning because that's what they report?
[03:48:28.472 --> 03:48:32.536]  There is a giant interdimensional alien invasion taking place.
[03:48:33.354 --> 03:48:48.096]  Through the cell phones, through the electromagnetic radiation, through the cyclotrons, the superconducting super colliders, there are enemies, there are enemy traders, collaborators in the human species, working with Satan and his fallen legions.
[03:48:49.969 --> 03:49:01.095]  At our dimensional level, but also at the interdimensional level of the brain, to blast huge holes into our dimension, like the Bible says, to literally turn demons loose on the Earth.
[03:49:01.095 --> 03:49:07.358]  And the planet is under a interdimensional space invader attack.
[03:49:07.358 --> 03:49:16.263]  The Book of Revelations does, not the way you just said it, but does predict that this planet will be filled with horrific creatures.
[03:49:18.148 --> 03:49:25.850]  Unleashed from hell and you believe this is that they're trying to bring that about right now Does that also involve the the building of the temple in Israel?
[03:49:25.850 --> 03:49:27.571]  Is that part of it?
[03:49:27.571 --> 03:49:43.215]  All of it is a countdown and that's why you see the new Pope He's saying I don't visit Christian and all this crazy stuff is it's all coming out in the open the pedophilia is all coming out It's all coming out and they can't have me on here and talk about this at this critical point How do we fight back?
[03:49:43.215 --> 03:49:44.876]  How do good people fight back Alex?
[03:49:47.321 --> 03:49:58.043]  Good people need to get right with God and know that most of these churches are controlled by their denomination and their 501c3, and most of these preachers are basically false prophets.
[03:49:58.043 --> 03:50:06.624]  People need to get on their knees and pray to God and ask for guidance, and just ask Jesus to come to their heart and say, God, this is so big, this is so evil what we're facing.
[03:50:06.624 --> 03:50:08.165]  I don't know what to do.
[03:50:08.165 --> 03:50:09.145]  God's about free will.
[03:50:09.145 --> 03:50:11.465]  Demons in these systems want to trick you.
[03:50:11.465 --> 03:50:12.425]  They hate free will.
[03:50:12.425 --> 03:50:14.386]  You have to say, God, I ask you into my heart.
[03:50:14.386 --> 03:50:15.306]  I ask for your protection.
[03:50:15.806 --> 03:50:24.313]  I asked you to send angels to protect me and my children, and I asked you to open up the gates of perception and give me the discernment to deal with this, and I'm on my knees and I repent.
[03:50:24.313 --> 03:50:36.643]  And if you do that, if you do that, ladies and gentlemen, if you do that, the Holy Ghost will come to you, and it's real, and instead of being possessed by this devilish energy, and everybody's got this devilish energy in them, it's gonna push back.
[03:50:36.643 --> 03:50:41.307]  But if you just push long enough, the Holy Spirit comes in, and the evil pretty much isn't there anymore.
[03:50:42.694 --> 03:50:44.616]  I always say, send an email.
[03:50:44.616 --> 03:50:47.278]  Down on your knees, don't send an email.
[03:50:47.278 --> 03:50:55.766]  And what you talk about, look, I went to Harvest, one of the biggest megachurches on earth, a guy named James McDonald.
[03:50:55.766 --> 03:51:00.029]  And you know, I got to see behind the curtain.
[03:51:00.029 --> 03:51:09.598]  And what I saw was, man, we need to remember that Satan can quote the Bible.
[03:51:14.664 --> 03:51:19.708]  What you said is so powerful.
[03:51:19.708 --> 03:51:22.130]  You and I have discussed this stuff for years.
[03:51:22.130 --> 03:51:26.873]  This is what we talk about, folks, when we talk off radio stations.
[03:51:26.873 --> 03:51:27.954]  We talk about God and family.
[03:51:30.635 --> 03:51:35.057]  Alex, so physically what happens?
[03:51:35.057 --> 03:51:41.438]  I had a guy on talking about, this guy Dr. Ted was on talking about scalar waves and all this and I didn't quite understand it.
[03:51:41.438 --> 03:51:43.279]  So what does praying do?
[03:51:43.279 --> 03:51:51.981]  I mean I pray and I pray with my family and every meal we pray and I encourage people to do that.
[03:51:51.981 --> 03:51:53.142]  But I always pray for wisdom.
[03:51:54.025 --> 03:51:55.406]  You pray for knowledge, I pray for wisdom.
[03:51:55.406 --> 03:51:57.087]  I guess it's the same thing.
[03:51:57.087 --> 03:51:59.648]  What do you think happens when we pray?
[03:51:59.648 --> 03:52:06.092]  When we pray to God versus these people that are trying to create little black holes and let in demonic forces.
[03:52:06.092 --> 03:52:07.573]  What happens?
[03:52:07.573 --> 03:52:09.014]  What's happening on the good side?
[03:52:09.014 --> 03:52:13.757]  Angels are being sent out?
[03:52:13.757 --> 03:52:14.897]  Exactly.
[03:52:14.897 --> 03:52:17.659]  And to be back the evil?
[03:52:17.659 --> 03:52:18.039]  Exactly.
[03:52:18.039 --> 03:52:20.841]  The devil operates in secret.
[03:52:20.841 --> 03:52:22.302]  Satan operates against free will.
[03:52:23.209 --> 03:52:31.673]  So God isn't going to open the channel up to you, except sometimes your family's praying for you, then it happens because that's the bridge.
[03:52:31.673 --> 03:52:32.914]  God's about free will.
[03:52:32.914 --> 03:52:36.256]  You have to open up the interdimensional bat signal.
[03:52:37.493 --> 03:52:41.155]  And when you open yourself up to God, a lot of people are going to be demonically influenced.
[03:52:41.155 --> 03:52:44.097]  They're going to feel something pushing it, something in the way.
[03:52:44.097 --> 03:52:45.678]  Someone's saying, don't do that, don't do that.
[03:52:45.678 --> 03:52:47.600]  You say, no, I call out to Jesus.
[03:52:47.600 --> 03:52:56.947]  I call out to God, you know, make contact with me, help me, cleanse me, give me discernment, give me wisdom, please help me, please help me help others, please.
[03:52:56.947 --> 03:52:58.227]  And then it happens.
[03:52:58.227 --> 03:53:00.409]  And then that connection starts.
[03:53:00.409 --> 03:53:02.971]  And a lot of times, right up front,
[03:53:03.849 --> 03:53:06.930]  You'll walk into work and somebody will walk up and start a fight with you right away.
[03:53:06.930 --> 03:53:08.991]  You'll go, whoa, this is like a movie.
[03:53:08.991 --> 03:53:10.232]  I've had it happen.
[03:53:10.232 --> 03:53:10.832]  I've had it happen.
[03:53:10.832 --> 03:53:12.193]  It's really mean.
[03:53:12.193 --> 03:53:14.774]  I encourage the listeners to do this.
[03:53:14.774 --> 03:53:16.335]  It is something, man.
[03:53:16.335 --> 03:53:19.736]  If you set out today or tomorrow and say, I'm going to do good.
[03:53:19.736 --> 03:53:20.316]  I'm going to do good.
[03:53:20.316 --> 03:53:20.897]  I'm going to be good.
[03:53:20.897 --> 03:53:22.097]  I'm going to be for God today.
[03:53:22.097 --> 03:53:23.278]  You will not believe what happens to you.
[03:53:28.621 --> 03:53:30.783]  I was joking with my guy here, Love Cheese, earlier.
[03:53:30.783 --> 03:53:38.410]  I was saying, man, I pray, I feel great, I leave the house, I love mankind, and then, of course, you have to go outside.
[03:53:38.410 --> 03:53:39.731]  Was Andrew Breitbart murdered?
[03:53:41.761 --> 03:53:44.542]  I think he was, and then everybody around him was so scared.
[03:53:44.542 --> 03:53:46.003]  And the coroner was killed.
[03:53:46.003 --> 03:53:49.505]  The coroner, guys like me and you said, what happened with Breitbart?
[03:53:49.505 --> 03:53:53.167]  And there was an investigation, and then that guy was murdered.
[03:53:53.167 --> 03:53:57.969]  By the way, we talked about a month ago about you coming on the show and me coming on the show.
[03:53:57.969 --> 03:54:05.253]  And you brought this up, and then I went back and pulled up LA Times articles where the coroner said, I think there's foul play.
[03:54:05.253 --> 03:54:08.675]  He's dead two days later from a heavy arsenic poisoning.
[03:54:08.675 --> 03:54:10.175]  He's murdered.
[03:54:10.175 --> 03:54:11.236]  And then that gets shut down.
[03:54:12.341 --> 03:54:14.323]  And no investigations done.
[03:54:14.323 --> 03:54:17.927]  And so absolutely, they killed Andrew Breitbart.
[03:54:17.927 --> 03:54:20.290]  Andrew Breitbart talked to me the night he died.
[03:54:20.290 --> 03:54:23.573]  We were working on a TV show together that you'll remember.
[03:54:23.573 --> 03:54:31.702]  And he told me that he had video footage that the second the world saw it, it would be the end of the Obamas, the end of the Clintons, and more.
[03:54:32.662 --> 03:54:35.786]  And that it was so extreme and so over the top and not what we thought.
[03:54:35.786 --> 03:54:36.727]  And I asked him, was it this?
[03:54:36.727 --> 03:54:37.228]  Was it that?
[03:54:37.228 --> 03:54:38.029]  Was it?
[03:54:38.029 --> 03:54:40.672]  And maybe it's tied to what we've read in those Podesta emails.
[03:54:40.672 --> 03:54:41.333]  I don't know.
[03:54:41.333 --> 03:54:43.596]  Alex, my final question.
[03:54:43.596 --> 03:54:45.078]  Are you afraid you're going to be assassinated?
[03:54:46.744 --> 03:54:48.026]  You know, I'm not afraid of it.
[03:54:48.026 --> 03:54:52.251]  I mean, I think there's obviously a good chance of that.
[03:54:52.251 --> 03:55:04.307]  They try to wind up enough crazy people or whatever to do it, but they have to first destroy my name completely and then just create a lie where I once was so that, you know, once I'm gone, then they can capture
[03:55:05.227 --> 03:55:12.291]  Uh, capture me and build a straw man so that I can then be an avatar or a character into the future.
[03:55:12.291 --> 03:55:13.311]  That's what the devil loves to do.
[03:55:13.311 --> 03:55:24.257]  Take somebody good, take something strong, take something that had big success, uh, for humanity and then shut it up and then build a counterfeit that you claim is that thing and then have it speak for you.
[03:55:24.257 --> 03:55:26.358]  I mean, like this Homeland TV show they admit is based on me.
[03:55:27.339 --> 03:55:32.282]  And, you know, he's this horrible lying demon who hurts people and is a racist and everything.
[03:55:32.282 --> 03:55:33.483]  And then it's the opposite of who I am.
[03:55:33.483 --> 03:55:34.563]  I mean, but that's what they did.
[03:55:34.563 --> 03:55:36.184]  It's part of a larger plan.
[03:55:36.184 --> 03:55:37.925]  So yes, they have to finish destroying me.
[03:55:37.925 --> 03:55:43.128]  Uh, and then, uh, then, then they do plan to either put me in prison or take me out.
[03:55:43.128 --> 03:55:44.869]  But you know, I mean, that's just what's got to be done.
[03:55:44.869 --> 03:55:46.891]  Uh, and I'm closer to God than I've ever been.
[03:55:46.891 --> 03:55:53.975]  And, you know, getting close to God for a while, a lot of really bad things happen, but you get to a certain point where it's like an event horizon and it's just like,
[03:55:54.688 --> 03:56:05.352]  It's like nothing they do matters anymore and then all these other great doors open and then God opens up the perception to a level just unbelievably breathtaking and then there's one thing you know you gotta do.
[03:56:05.352 --> 03:56:18.576]  Make sure that these little souls, these little children, these innocent people around us, make sure we stand up for them so that we can protect them and get them under God's wings and get them into the future for eternity with all these great people and our ancestors that are all waiting for us beyond the veil.
[03:56:20.697 --> 03:56:24.438]  The right-wing smear machine has gotten Alex Jones-ified this election cycle.
[03:56:24.438 --> 03:56:25.658]  There's a guy named Alex Jones.
[03:56:25.658 --> 03:56:26.558]  Alex Jones.
[03:56:26.558 --> 03:56:27.618]  From Infowars.
[03:56:27.618 --> 03:56:28.259]  From Infowars.
[03:56:28.259 --> 03:56:28.599]  Yeah.
[03:56:28.599 --> 03:56:29.359]  Alex Jones.
[03:56:29.359 --> 03:56:30.179]  Alex Jones.
[03:56:30.179 --> 03:56:33.680]  One of those guys who believes Bigfoot was responsible for 9-11.
[03:56:33.680 --> 03:56:36.540]  I heard that on Alex Jones, so it's true!
[03:56:36.540 --> 03:56:41.481]  Claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[03:56:41.481 --> 03:56:46.282]  The conspiracy du jour, Hillary Clinton is harboring a secret medical condition.
[03:56:46.282 --> 03:56:48.223]  You just had to keep digging, didn't you Alex?
[03:56:48.943 --> 03:56:51.525]  I heard it on Alex Jones, so I know it's true!
[03:56:51.525 --> 03:57:00.993]  Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by changing its algorithm to bury stories like the Clinton body count story.
[03:57:00.993 --> 03:57:02.734]  That's according to website InfoWars.
[03:57:02.734 --> 03:57:04.996]  And this really is just so disgusting.
[03:57:04.996 --> 03:57:07.538]  The juice of these pickles is on you, Alex Jones.
[03:57:11.189 --> 03:57:13.930]  It goes right from Alex Jones, and it shows up in Donald Trump's mouth.
[03:57:13.930 --> 03:57:17.071]  Hillary Clinton created ISIS with Obama.
[03:57:17.071 --> 03:57:23.233]  The very fringe of the conspiracy movement, like Alex Jones, are being kind of incorporated into the campaign.
[03:57:23.233 --> 03:57:25.434]  If Trump gets elected, he's gonna be Secretary of Defense.
[03:57:25.434 --> 03:57:27.595]  I think that Alex Jones is a lunatic.
[03:57:27.595 --> 03:57:28.815]  Move, bitch!
[03:57:28.815 --> 03:57:29.835]  Get out the way!
[03:57:29.835 --> 03:57:32.296]  Bill Clinton is a rapist, Infowars.com.
[03:57:32.296 --> 03:57:33.497]  Bill Clinton is a rapist!
[03:57:35.059 --> 03:57:36.382]  Bill Clinton is a rapist.

[03:57:48.299 --> 03:57:56.861]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.

[03:58:34.074 --> 03:58:34.915]  Don't live

[03:58:44.503 --> 03:58:47.565]  Our grandparents, the great-grandparents, knew they canned food.
[03:58:47.565 --> 03:58:50.528]  During the fall, so they'd have it during the winter.
[03:58:50.528 --> 03:58:53.471]  And that's what I'm talking about at InfoWarsStore.com.
