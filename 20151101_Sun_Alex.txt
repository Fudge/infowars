[00:00.000 --> 00:15.600]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show on this Sunday, November 1st, 2015.
[00:15.600 --> 00:17.480]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[00:17.480 --> 00:23.240]  We've got a lot of news that looks at the kinds of masquerades and other things that
[00:23.240 --> 00:24.640]  are being done to scare people.
[00:24.640 --> 00:26.480]  Of course, we just finished with Halloween.
[00:26.480 --> 00:28.440]  That's what that holiday is based on.
[00:28.440 --> 00:32.920]  But the other 364 days of the year, there's a lot of that going on by the government.
[00:32.920 --> 00:35.040]  And we're going to look at some of the examples of that.
[00:35.040 --> 00:36.880]  Take a look at this story, for example.
[00:36.880 --> 00:42.760]  We've got a prosecutor who went absolutely crazy over fake spiders.
[00:42.760 --> 00:48.440]  They put up some decorations in the office back the 5th of October.
[00:48.440 --> 00:53.240]  What makes this interesting is, this is the same prosecutor who went after a West Virginia
[00:53.240 --> 00:54.240]  8th grader.
[00:54.240 --> 00:56.920]  He was suspended, then he was arrested.
[00:56.920 --> 00:57.920]  Why?
[00:57.920 --> 01:01.840]  Because he had an NRA T-shirt with a rifle pictured on it.
[01:01.840 --> 01:03.560]  A picture of a rifle.
[01:03.560 --> 01:09.080]  So you get arrested, you get suspended, you get a gag order slapped on you by this prosecutor.
[01:09.080 --> 01:14.880]  And then what happens when he sees some plastic spiders in the office?
[01:14.880 --> 01:16.960]  He goes absolutely crazy.
[01:16.960 --> 01:23.000]  He pulls out a real gun, not a picture of a gun, not a plastic gun, a real gun, and starts
[01:23.000 --> 01:25.120]  waving it around the office.
[01:25.120 --> 01:29.480]  They say the prosecutor, the alleged incident happened on October 5th after several secretaries
[01:29.480 --> 01:31.400]  in the office decorated for Halloween.
[01:31.400 --> 01:34.640]  The decorations included many fake spiders throughout the office.
[01:34.640 --> 01:37.760]  They said they had, he said, there's fake spiders everywhere.
[01:37.760 --> 01:38.960]  He said, this isn't funny.
[01:38.960 --> 01:40.280]  I can't stand this.
[01:40.280 --> 01:41.640]  And he pulled out a gun.
[01:41.640 --> 01:45.840]  Now they say that there was no magazine in it, but the secretaries don't know if there's
[01:45.840 --> 01:48.520]  any magazine in it, scared them to death, three of them.
[01:48.520 --> 01:52.880]  And so the person writing this for the NRA says, sounds to me like three counts of brandishing
[01:52.880 --> 01:57.400]  a weapon at a minimum, or maybe assault with a deadly weapon at a maximum.
[01:57.400 --> 02:01.840]  In any event, it's clear this prosecutor, Mr. White, lacks a temperament and discernment
[02:01.840 --> 02:04.480]  to be safe with a firearm.
[02:04.480 --> 02:09.200]  Maybe that's why he's so scared of pictures of rifles, yet he has one.
[02:09.200 --> 02:11.240]  And that's the kind of thing we're going to be talking about today.
[02:11.240 --> 02:13.440]  We're going to be talking about global warming.
[02:13.440 --> 02:18.240]  We're going to be talking about the Department of Transportation setting up a national address
[02:18.240 --> 02:21.040]  database to get insights into you.
[02:21.040 --> 02:22.040]  And guess what?
[02:22.040 --> 02:25.360]  We're talking about geospatial intelligence.
[02:25.360 --> 02:27.000]  What do we tell you about Jade Helm?
[02:27.000 --> 02:29.480]  What do we tell you about geospatial intelligence?
[02:29.480 --> 02:35.720]  It's the largest growing field of intelligence, mapping you, mapping your behavior, looking
[02:35.720 --> 02:42.200]  at your activity, using that to put you into a threat matrix, which they will then label
[02:42.200 --> 02:45.240]  you algorithmically with some artificial intelligence.
[02:45.240 --> 02:49.680]  Not necessarily generalized intelligence, but artificial intelligence nevertheless.
[02:49.680 --> 02:53.080]  You will be labeled by a computerist to whether or not you're a threat, and they may send
[02:53.080 --> 02:56.200]  out some real officers if they think that you're a threat.
[02:56.200 --> 02:58.640]  This is something that you really should be afraid of.
[02:58.640 --> 03:01.560]  So we're going to be looking at a lot of different things today.
[03:01.560 --> 03:03.040]  What should you be afraid of?
[03:03.040 --> 03:04.320]  What should you not be afraid of?
[03:04.320 --> 03:07.960]  And of course, we're going to be talking to Alex Jones in the second hour.
[03:07.960 --> 03:13.600]  He's going to be contacting us and giving us his take on this Islamic state claim to
[03:13.600 --> 03:18.080]  have shot down a Russian airliner over the Sinai Peninsula.
[03:18.080 --> 03:21.920]  When it's looking from latest reports, they are saying that it looks like this airplane
[03:21.920 --> 03:23.440]  exploded in midair.
[03:23.440 --> 03:28.760]  That would be an indication that it was hit by a missile or exploded by a bomb internally
[03:28.760 --> 03:35.040]  because you get a large footprint of debris when something blows up in midair, just like
[03:35.040 --> 03:38.720]  we saw with United Flight 93 on 9-11.
[03:38.720 --> 03:45.240]  There was a large debris field about eight miles as reported by eyewitnesses there.
[03:45.240 --> 03:49.560]  When you see something like that, it indicates that it's been exploded in midair that did
[03:49.560 --> 03:51.720]  not explode on impact with ground.
[03:51.720 --> 03:57.880]  And that appears to be what the cases with this Islamic claim, perhaps they did shoot
[03:57.880 --> 04:02.040]  this down with a surface-to-air missile that would be very worrying if these terrorists
[04:02.040 --> 04:05.080]  have been provided with that now in addition.
[04:05.080 --> 04:07.560]  But we have seen this war continue to escalate.
[04:07.560 --> 04:09.800]  We see other wars are escalating.
[04:09.800 --> 04:13.840]  Of course, the American government is pushing the envelope everywhere in the world, confronting
[04:13.840 --> 04:16.540]  everyone, trying to raise threat levels everywhere.
[04:16.540 --> 04:21.040]  We see this in NATO drills around Sicily.
[04:21.040 --> 04:25.560]  The Sicilian people are rioting and saying, Sicily is not a war lab.
[04:25.560 --> 04:30.400]  Hundreds of people took the street to complain about the fact that there is a massive NATO
[04:30.400 --> 04:32.520]  military maneuver.
[04:32.520 --> 04:36.560]  I guess, though, they were not called conspiracy theorists, like the people who pushed back
[04:36.560 --> 04:42.280]  against a massive military maneuver here in the United States, labeling areas of the United
[04:42.280 --> 04:44.320]  States as hostile.
[04:44.320 --> 04:47.280]  Everyone knows that these kinds of drills are provocative.
[04:47.280 --> 04:52.040]  We feel it's provocative if the Iranian Navy comes to the Atlantic, which they've announced
[04:52.040 --> 04:53.040]  they're going to do.
[04:53.040 --> 04:57.160]  And when we do it up to the Russians' border, they consider that to be provocative.
[04:57.160 --> 04:58.160]  We'll be right back.
[04:58.160 --> 04:59.160]  Stay with us.
[04:59.160 --> 05:27.160]  We'll keep up to date with what's going on in the world.
[05:27.160 --> 05:31.160]  We also will take a look back on stories and video reports we've covered in the past and
[05:31.160 --> 05:36.480]  how they relate to current news, an arsenal of knowledge right to your inbox every day.
[05:36.480 --> 05:41.240]  The great part is your newsletter information cannot be censored or black-holed like we've
[05:41.240 --> 05:46.280]  caught Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, or Google doing to important information in the past.
[05:46.280 --> 05:51.040]  Log on to infowars.com forward slash newsletter, watch the special message from Alex Jones,
[05:51.040 --> 05:52.040]  and subscribe.
[05:52.040 --> 05:56.240]  I'm David Knight with infowars.com, and on behalf of the entire team here at the Central
[05:56.240 --> 06:10.720]  Texas Command Center, we thank you for your support.
[06:10.720 --> 06:16.240]  Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[06:16.240 --> 06:21.560]  Welcome to the Alex Jones radio show.
[06:21.560 --> 06:26.360]  I'm David Knight, your host on this Sunday, November 1st, 2015.
[06:26.360 --> 06:28.400]  2015 is nearly over.
[06:28.400 --> 06:32.120]  It's been going very quickly, and in many ways, not going very well.
[06:32.120 --> 06:38.040]  I just talked about a story that was highlighted by the NRA about a prosecutor who had come
[06:38.040 --> 06:42.320]  down incredibly hard on a student just because he had a picture of a gun.
[06:42.320 --> 06:43.320]  It was an NRA t-shirt.
[06:43.320 --> 06:44.800]  He had a picture of a gun.
[06:44.800 --> 06:50.720]  Then we find, in response to some plastic Halloween spiders, this prosecutor in West
[06:50.720 --> 06:56.520]  Virginia absolutely loses it, pulls out a pistol, and starts waving it around with three
[06:56.520 --> 06:57.760]  secretaries there.
[06:57.760 --> 07:03.840]  That's the kind of out-of-control government that says that they're going to protect us.
[07:03.840 --> 07:07.480]  Don't seem to be able to understand where the real threats are.
[07:07.480 --> 07:13.040]  And incredibly irresponsible, incredibly unstable themselves.
[07:13.040 --> 07:17.280]  Just like this blimp fiasco that we saw this last week that cut loose.
[07:17.280 --> 07:21.360]  And they're saying, this event raises questions about the value and the reliability of the
[07:21.360 --> 07:22.760]  J-Lens program.
[07:22.760 --> 07:23.760]  You think?
[07:23.760 --> 07:24.760]  You think?
[07:24.760 --> 07:30.280]  I mean, this is a $3 billion program, absolute joke, especially.
[07:30.280 --> 07:35.240]  Not just the fact that it broke, that it drugged this tether through the Northeast, taking
[07:35.240 --> 07:40.280]  power out for 27,000 people, I think it was, and ultimately crashing.
[07:40.280 --> 07:41.720]  No, that's bad enough.
[07:41.720 --> 07:47.120]  But when you think about the fact, this is the very program that they say is going to
[07:47.120 --> 07:49.280]  protect the capital area.
[07:49.280 --> 07:55.400]  Back in a couple of months ago, Colonel Frank Rice told a CBS, actually it was in February.
[07:55.400 --> 08:00.640]  He says, we are in the NCR, the National Capital Region.
[08:00.640 --> 08:03.760]  Sounds really official, doesn't it, when the Pentagon puts those names on it?
[08:03.760 --> 08:08.400]  He says, it is our geopolitical center of power in the United States, and we must protect
[08:08.400 --> 08:09.400]  it.
[08:09.400 --> 08:15.120]  So they put a blimp up, these things, that they can't even keep tethered.
[08:15.120 --> 08:18.480]  And it's even worse than that, because that was in February.
[08:18.480 --> 08:22.880]  Then on April 15th, remember that guy who got a gyrocopter and he flew it through all
[08:22.880 --> 08:28.600]  the protected airspace and landed it on the lawn of the White House?
[08:28.600 --> 08:29.600]  Remember that?
[08:29.600 --> 08:30.600]  Remember that?
[08:30.600 --> 08:33.800]  That was a failure of J-Lens.
[08:33.800 --> 08:37.640]  And when the members of Congress wanted to know, how in the world could that happen without
[08:37.640 --> 08:38.840]  anybody being notified?
[08:38.840 --> 08:44.680]  How could somebody fly this gyrocopter all that distance and then through Washington
[08:44.680 --> 08:50.680]  and land it on the West lawn of the, I'm sorry, of the Capitol building, not the White House,
[08:50.680 --> 08:52.680]  it says here?
[08:52.680 --> 08:53.680]  How could they do that?
[08:53.680 --> 08:57.000]  I think it was the White House, it says of the U.S. Capitol, I think they mean the White
[08:57.000 --> 08:58.000]  House.
[08:58.000 --> 08:59.000]  Was it the White House?
[08:59.000 --> 09:00.760]  Anyway, they say, they wanted to know, how did that happen?
[09:00.760 --> 09:03.280]  And they said, well, J-Lens was inoperable that day.
[09:03.280 --> 09:07.800]  I don't know if the cable had been cut, and they were trying to get it back.
[09:07.800 --> 09:09.840]  On April the 15th or what the deal was.
[09:09.840 --> 09:10.840]  But there you go.
[09:10.840 --> 09:15.520]  See, we're told that we have to sacrifice all of this blood and treasure.
[09:15.520 --> 09:17.680]  We have to sacrifice the Constitution.
[09:17.680 --> 09:20.080]  We have to sacrifice the rule of law.
[09:20.080 --> 09:25.080]  We have to sacrifice all of our God-given rights for national security.
[09:25.080 --> 09:26.080]  National security.
[09:26.080 --> 09:29.520]  And of course, national security isn't your safety or my safety.
[09:29.520 --> 09:33.280]  It's continuity of government, and they can't even do that.
[09:33.280 --> 09:34.280]  Can't even do that.
[09:34.280 --> 09:36.320]  $3 billion for a blimp.
[09:36.320 --> 09:39.120]  Because of the nightly news, that's inflation for you, isn't it?
[09:39.120 --> 09:43.440]  $3 billion for a blimp, and they can't even keep it tied to the ground.
[09:43.440 --> 09:49.280]  Or you can take this instance here of the Oregon TSA agents forcing a 90-year-old woman
[09:49.280 --> 09:54.480]  to take off her shirt and bra after a full body scanner picked up a secret pocket in
[09:54.480 --> 09:55.480]  her lingerie.
[09:55.480 --> 09:59.000]  Because they can have their secrets, but if you've got a secret pocket, even if there's
[09:59.000 --> 10:03.840]  nothing in it, you've got to strip as a 90-year-old lady.
[10:03.840 --> 10:08.720]  And her son, who's 67, says airport screeners made his elderly mother remove all of her
[10:08.720 --> 10:10.560]  clothing above the waist.
[10:10.560 --> 10:17.040]  Harriet Charnay of Virginia had sewn a secret pocket into her bra to keep extra cash, and
[10:17.040 --> 10:19.560]  the TSA body scanner picked that up.
[10:19.560 --> 10:23.400]  Now the TSA says, well, no, that's not the case.
[10:23.400 --> 10:24.880]  We didn't ask her to disrobe.
[10:24.880 --> 10:29.560]  Look, this is why you need to record this yourself.
[10:29.560 --> 10:33.880]  This is why you need to get your camera going because they're not going to give you access
[10:33.880 --> 10:35.240]  to their cameras.
[10:35.240 --> 10:38.320]  Or they'll put you in an area where there are no cameras so they can do what they want
[10:38.320 --> 10:39.320]  to to you.
[10:39.320 --> 10:40.600]  And of course, there's proof of this.
[10:40.600 --> 10:42.960]  There's proof that they did not do anything.
[10:42.960 --> 10:47.920]  The TSA says, well, that's not TSA screening procedures.
[10:47.920 --> 10:49.440]  That's not our MO.
[10:49.440 --> 10:51.160]  Well, you know what?
[10:51.160 --> 10:54.000]  We have a Fourth Amendment that they ignore all the time.
[10:54.000 --> 10:57.240]  So what do the TSA screening procedures mean?
[10:57.240 --> 11:02.600]  I mean, ultimately, if you're going to violate the document that you swear to to get your
[11:02.600 --> 11:07.520]  authority, if you're going to violate that as a matter of routine policy, then if you've
[11:07.520 --> 11:12.360]  got no constitution, then why would they care about any other policies that you've got?
[11:12.360 --> 11:14.440]  And that's really where we are at this point.
[11:14.440 --> 11:17.800]  You know, as we're looking at some of the things that people are putting out, of course,
[11:17.800 --> 11:21.920]  I actually follow Hillary Clinton on Twitter because sometimes there's some really funny
[11:21.920 --> 11:23.320]  things like this.
[11:23.320 --> 11:26.320]  Now people, I know this is a radio show and you can't see this picture.
[11:26.320 --> 11:27.800]  So I'll try to describe it.
[11:27.800 --> 11:32.960]  It looks like Hillary has identified the staffer who is responsible for these leaks.
[11:32.960 --> 11:33.960]  There she is right there.
[11:33.960 --> 11:34.960]  Can you see that picture there?
[11:34.960 --> 11:37.680]  Actually, it's a little girl, it's a toddler.
[11:37.680 --> 11:41.320]  And she's got a briefcase that says Senators Briefcase.
[11:41.320 --> 11:45.600]  And Hillary looks really creepy in this, almost kind of Biden-esque.
[11:45.600 --> 11:48.520]  She's got both hands on this little girl's shoulder and she's leaning way forward, which
[11:48.520 --> 11:52.040]  makes her head look a lot larger in the camera.
[11:52.040 --> 11:53.760]  And I tweeted that back to her.
[11:53.760 --> 11:56.840]  And I said, if she gives you an apple, don't eat it.
[11:56.840 --> 11:58.320]  Actually, I can't take credit for that.
[11:58.320 --> 11:59.880]  That was my son's comments.
[11:59.880 --> 12:02.040]  That was really funny.
[12:02.040 --> 12:06.560]  But when I looked at that and I thought, you know, this is so typical.
[12:06.560 --> 12:10.920]  Everybody knows that Hillary Clinton is doing everything she can to make herself look normal,
[12:10.920 --> 12:13.160]  to look approachable.
[12:13.160 --> 12:16.480]  There was a thing from The Onion, which definitely Leans left.
[12:16.480 --> 12:20.600]  And they had a pseudo editorial from Hillary Clinton said, I am fun.
[12:20.600 --> 12:21.600]  I'm fun.
[12:21.600 --> 12:22.600]  I enjoy fun.
[12:22.600 --> 12:24.440]  I have fun and can be fun.
[12:24.440 --> 12:28.880]  Fun is a word that accurately describes me and a large quantity of things of which I'm
[12:28.880 --> 12:29.880]  fun.
[12:29.880 --> 12:31.800]  I appreciate fun when I encounter it.
[12:31.800 --> 12:36.080]  And I have been known to partake in activities that produce fun for myself and others.
[12:36.080 --> 12:41.040]  Fun is something I have when amongst a group of people, thus I am a fun person, it goes
[12:41.040 --> 12:42.040]  on and on.
[12:42.040 --> 12:44.080]  And then it winds up with this very long.
[12:44.080 --> 12:47.720]  But he says, I have completed my argument, but I would like to reiterate the fact that
[12:47.720 --> 12:51.400]  I take pleasure in having fun and being fun, just like majority Americans.
[12:51.400 --> 12:56.040]  Now that I've presented adequate evidence for the existence of my fun, accessible nature,
[12:56.040 --> 12:58.960]  there'll be no need to revisit this subject going forward.
[12:58.960 --> 12:59.960]  Thank you.
[12:59.960 --> 13:04.840]  That's exactly why she responded in the Benghazi trials.
[13:04.840 --> 13:07.480]  They nailed her, I think, to the tee.
[13:07.480 --> 13:12.720]  And of course, the White House has their Halloween party with costumes and prizes.
[13:12.720 --> 13:17.400]  And the one who won there was a toddler who's dressed up like the Pope.
[13:17.400 --> 13:21.800]  Because who has scared more people in 2015 than the Pope?
[13:21.800 --> 13:25.360]  And he did it along with Obama, partners in scaring people.
[13:25.360 --> 13:30.880]  I think they scared more people and telling us with their tricks that they want us to
[13:30.880 --> 13:38.080]  treat the globalists to an open season on our wallets here.
[13:38.080 --> 13:39.160]  That's precisely what he's got there.
[13:39.160 --> 13:40.160]  And you can see the pictures.
[13:40.160 --> 13:45.080]  If you're looking at this, a little kid, a little toddler, dressed up as the Pope, well,
[13:45.080 --> 13:48.640]  the climate change is really the scare that we have to be concerned about.
[13:48.640 --> 13:51.080]  Of course, this is where they're coming.
[13:51.080 --> 13:58.280]  And this week, we had global bishops calling for complete decarbonization by 2050.
[13:58.280 --> 14:01.800]  And you've got to ask yourself, there's a lot of conservative Catholics who are saying,
[14:01.800 --> 14:06.080]  why is this the number one priority of the Catholic Church?
[14:06.080 --> 14:09.760]  Why is it their only concern, quite frankly?
[14:09.760 --> 14:13.040]  That seems to be the only concern right now of the Catholic Church.
[14:13.040 --> 14:17.600]  So now you've got the bishops last Monday, appealed for a breakthrough at the coming
[14:17.600 --> 14:19.280]  Paris climate talks.
[14:19.280 --> 14:21.520]  This is coming up next month, folks.
[14:21.520 --> 14:23.480]  This is where they're going to try to run this all together.
[14:23.480 --> 14:27.240]  This is where they're going to try to get this slammed through with a president.
[14:27.240 --> 14:31.520]  And I've got an amazing update on that for you in the next article here.
[14:31.520 --> 14:32.960]  But this is what they're saying.
[14:32.960 --> 14:38.440]  They want not only a drastic reduction in the emission of carbon dioxide and other toxic
[14:38.440 --> 14:44.720]  gases, quote unquote, carbon dioxide and other toxic gases.
[14:44.720 --> 14:47.680]  This is why you don't let bishops do science.
[14:47.680 --> 14:50.400]  This is why you don't let them dictate to you.
[14:50.400 --> 14:53.080]  Carbon dioxide is not a toxic gas, okay?
[14:53.080 --> 14:54.600]  That's what you breathe out.
[14:54.600 --> 14:57.240]  That's what I'm breathing out right now as I talk to you.
[14:57.240 --> 14:59.840]  They say they want to end the fossil fuel era.
[14:59.840 --> 15:05.840]  Well, again, many of us believe, and I'm one of them, that this whole fossil fuel thing
[15:05.840 --> 15:07.080]  is a bunch of nonsense.
[15:07.080 --> 15:12.000]  I don't think it's something that was invented by the CIA, the whole idea of peak oil.
[15:12.000 --> 15:15.360]  Fossil fuel is created from organic material.
[15:15.360 --> 15:18.000]  And I don't think it is something that we're running out of.
[15:18.000 --> 15:22.720]  I've shown before, a couple of times, quite frankly, I've shown before, it was either
[15:22.720 --> 15:25.360]  Newsweek or Time Magazine.
[15:25.360 --> 15:29.080]  And it was during the Carter administration when everybody was freaking out because of
[15:29.080 --> 15:31.680]  the shock that had been put through the system by the Saudis.
[15:31.680 --> 15:33.480]  And they said, we're going to be running out of oil.
[15:33.480 --> 15:38.960]  And they have charts showing that, and this was in 1979, we were going to be out of oil
[15:38.960 --> 15:44.120]  within eight years, mid-80s, we were going to be out of oil, and that was the narrative
[15:44.120 --> 15:45.120]  at that point.
[15:45.120 --> 15:48.600]  When we come back, I'm going to tell you something that you really need to be afraid of.
[15:48.600 --> 15:51.240]  The stealth UN agenda for climate change, we'll be right back.
[15:51.240 --> 16:03.040]  Clean, pure drinking water, you can't survive without it, but where do you get it, Alexa

[16:14.080 --> 16:19.240]  water, pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new gravity block core with
[16:19.240 --> 16:26.600]  a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria,

[18:23.040 --> 18:25.480]  foods, I believe you're making a huge mistake.

[19:02.440 --> 19:07.640]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[19:07.640 --> 19:10.840]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[19:10.840 --> 19:16.120]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[19:32.720 --> 19:37.120]  been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of brain force.
[19:37.120 --> 19:40.200]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[19:40.200 --> 19:43.640]  I'm staring at the computer all day working doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[19:43.640 --> 19:45.760]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[19:45.760 --> 19:49.120]  It doesn't have stimulus, it doesn't have garbage in it, it has natural things that do
[19:49.120 --> 19:50.120]  it clean.
[19:50.120 --> 20:02.560]  You'll find brain force and other game-changing products at infowarsselect.com or call 888-253-3139.
[20:02.560 --> 20:21.240]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:21.240 --> 20:39.280]  Trashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[20:39.280 --> 20:56.640]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[20:56.640 --> 21:11.240]  Maybe we could start with the global bishops who don't know what they're talking about.
[21:11.240 --> 21:28.080]  But now, I guess you could say first, they came for the pumpkins, we had the EPA warning
[21:28.080 --> 21:32.640]  us about the pumpkins and I've got a great film here of Alex taking it on himself to
[21:32.640 --> 21:41.640]  the USA.
[21:41.640 --> 21:46.560]  Right now, we've got a sale on infowarsselect storeable food, 10% off the complete line as
[21:46.560 --> 21:47.960]  well as free shipping.
[21:47.960 --> 21:55.240]  This is our introduction to infowarsselect, again, this is food that is made in the USA.
[21:55.240 --> 21:58.160]  Even the packaging is made in the USA.

[22:02.400 --> 22:07.960]  we use military grade barrier against light, oxygen, moisture, keeping that out of the

[22:12.720 --> 22:16.560]  So it'll last in its original condition for 25 years and then even after you open it,
[22:16.560 --> 22:18.560]  you can reseal it for a while.
[22:18.560 --> 22:25.440]  Again, use the promo code FOOD at checkout for 10% off and a huge discount of free shipping.

[22:29.920 --> 22:31.280]  it's an extended sale.
[22:31.280 --> 22:37.480]  As I pointed out, the EPA is worried about, I guess maybe some of these other toxic gases
[22:37.480 --> 22:42.560]  that the bishops are talking about would be methane, I mean, definitely methane is more
[22:42.560 --> 22:50.760]  toxic smelling than CO2 is, but they've told everybody that pumpkins create a lot of garbage
[22:50.760 --> 22:52.840]  when you smash them, so you shouldn't do that.
[22:52.840 --> 23:19.520]  So Alex takes upon himself to smash these evil pumpkins, here's that cut.
[23:19.520 --> 23:29.160]  The interview department says that pumpkins are evil and their cosmic climate change will
[23:29.160 --> 23:31.160]  eradicate them from the world.
[23:31.160 --> 23:35.160]  We need to save the universe now, we need to get rid of all these evil pumpkins, they're
[23:35.160 --> 23:40.920]  going to destroy humanity for the future and forever and for your children.
[23:40.920 --> 23:44.560]  Destroy them, we're going to smash them into oblivion so they don't exist anymore, we'll
[23:44.560 --> 23:47.120]  get rid of them like the dot over.
[23:47.120 --> 23:53.320]  There's a report out today where the EPA is smashing pumpkins in a new video advertisement
[23:53.320 --> 23:58.520]  saying plants are bad because they increase the carbon footprint.
[23:58.520 --> 24:06.240]  They are now smashing pumpkins and they're coming out and saying that sunlight is bad
[24:06.240 --> 24:07.240]  for the earth.
[24:07.240 --> 24:14.320]  I'm bringing these to Alex, he'll know what to do, he'll know what to do with them, I'll
[24:14.320 --> 24:21.320]  follow in the order, it doesn't matter how insane.
[24:21.320 --> 24:32.000]  Master, I have the enemy, I have the enemy, oh no, look at these evil pumpkins, they have
[24:32.000 --> 24:35.800]  come from beyond to ruin the biosphere.
[24:35.800 --> 24:40.960]  Good green police, good, you working with the other politically correct people, banning
[24:40.960 --> 24:47.800]  the word mother and father and banning Halloween costumes, have proven how liberal you are.
[24:47.800 --> 24:52.520]  Now, now, just relax for a moment, don't symbol the enemy over there for X and Y.
[24:52.520 --> 24:56.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is not satire.
[24:56.600 --> 25:00.560]  The energy department and others have called for cutting down trees in mass, living trees
[25:00.560 --> 25:04.920]  and smashing and destroying pumpkins and not letting people grow pumpkins because they
[25:04.920 --> 25:10.760]  put off carbon dioxide so do your part, anything carbon emitting, whether it's your French
[25:10.760 --> 25:17.200]  bulldog or your grandmother, follow the example in the orders of our loving saviors at the
[25:17.200 --> 25:20.120]  Department of Energy.
[25:20.120 --> 25:24.520]  Public education has trained you well, look at you as servile, mindless, unscientific
[25:24.520 --> 25:29.800]  idiot giving us total power over all human life, paying money directly to Al Gore, George
[25:29.800 --> 25:34.920]  Soros and Barack Obama, and the climate exchanges as well as Lord Rothschild, my minion, you
[25:34.920 --> 25:38.240]  understand by training people that pumpkins should be destroyed, we're training them
[25:38.240 --> 25:42.280]  that you will be destroyed if you worthless crap.
[25:42.280 --> 25:50.200]  So without further ado, I, the noble eugenicist, will take out the enemy of the people via
[25:50.200 --> 25:58.120]  crossbow, eat this Charlie Brown in your Halloween party, the enemy will fall.
[25:58.120 --> 26:09.520]  It's incredibly important to take out the adult carbon criminals, and the adolescents,
[26:09.520 --> 26:15.640]  but it's the babies that can grow up and resist us, just like it planned parenthood, they
[26:15.640 --> 26:21.240]  can also fetch a nice price for their parts.
[26:21.240 --> 26:25.240]  China unfortunately just shut down our one child policy the day the Rockefeller set up,
[26:25.240 --> 26:38.920]  we're having some failures, but not for long, bring in that karma right now.
[26:38.920 --> 26:44.440]  There's always new enemies to fight, carbons everywhere on this planet, it's almost like
[26:44.440 --> 26:59.120]  we're carbon based life forms, and just when they thought they were safe, I found another
[26:59.120 --> 27:00.120]  one.
[27:00.120 --> 27:02.720]  I mean, it's psychotic to say that pumpkins are evil and should be killed, this is a carbon
[27:02.720 --> 27:06.440]  based life form as well, and that's what they're demonizing, they're telling the president
[27:06.440 --> 27:13.120]  that all life is bad because it exiles carbon dioxide, or it puts off carbon dioxide, this
[27:13.120 --> 27:19.160]  is total insanity, and that's why we're here, exposing it at infowars.com.
[27:19.160 --> 27:27.240]  Yes, again, that was Alex Jones destroying the pumpkins at the EPA says we need to be
[27:27.240 --> 27:32.280]  afraid, very afraid of, now you need to understand what you really need to be afraid of.
[27:32.280 --> 27:37.240]  You need to not be afraid of pumpkins, but you do need to be afraid of a global Supreme
[27:37.240 --> 27:42.360]  Court, that's one of the things that appears to be coming out of the imminent UN climate
[27:42.360 --> 27:44.320]  summit in Paris.
[27:44.320 --> 27:50.960]  Now remember that it was about six years ago, where they had a conference in Copenhagen
[27:50.960 --> 27:55.480]  that failed to lock down any significant agreements as they point out, they say that five days
[27:55.480 --> 28:00.200]  of negotiation in Bonn last week underscored deep divisions including disagreements over
[28:00.200 --> 28:06.200]  who should pay for renewable energy sources, and listen to this, who should be tasked with
[28:06.200 --> 28:11.960]  making sure that countries uphold their green pledges, so see there has to be a transference
[28:11.960 --> 28:18.080]  of wealth, and there has to be an enforcement mechanism, and it has to be global.
[28:18.080 --> 28:23.200]  This is about global governance, it is about crony capitalism, but it is also about setting
[28:23.200 --> 28:24.720]  up global governance.
[28:24.720 --> 28:28.880]  This article from New American breaks us down, they say the official draft of the climate
[28:28.880 --> 28:34.960]  treaty for the soon to start UN climate summit in Paris, proposes to establish a global Supreme
[28:34.960 --> 28:41.840]  Court that would rule on issues like climate justice, climate finance, technology transfers,
[28:41.840 --> 28:45.480]  and climate debt, and we're going to break that down when we come back for you.
[28:45.480 --> 28:49.520]  Alex Jones is going to be joining us in the second hour to talk about the airliner that

[31:03.120 --> 31:08.440]  Most forms of Vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and could not be properly absorbed
[31:08.440 --> 31:09.440]  by the body.
[31:09.440 --> 31:14.280]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections which are

[33:03.040 --> 33:18.360]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:18.360 --> 33:33.880]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight, your host.
[33:33.880 --> 33:36.720]  Alex will be joining us in the second hour.
[33:36.720 --> 33:40.160]  He wants to particularly come in and talk about what's going on with this Russian airliner
[33:40.160 --> 33:47.080]  that was presumably shot out of the sky or blown out of the sky over Egypt.
[33:47.080 --> 33:51.320]  Alex is going to be with us breaking that down in the second hour.
[33:51.320 --> 33:57.640]  We just played a satire piece that he and Buckley did with smashing pumpkins.
[33:57.640 --> 34:03.960]  Not the group, but the idea that the EPA is trying to sell us that methane gas from decaying
[34:03.960 --> 34:07.000]  pumpkins is threatening the climate of everyone.
[34:07.000 --> 34:08.640]  I don't think that's the case.
[34:08.640 --> 34:13.440]  And quite frankly, though, they're going to be making the case for global governance,
[34:13.440 --> 34:18.920]  for a massive transfer of wealth and power coming up in just about a month.
[34:18.920 --> 34:23.400]  And again, they failed when they tried to do this in Copenhagen back in 2009.
[34:23.400 --> 34:26.520]  Now six years later, this is what the push is about.
[34:26.520 --> 34:30.640]  And of course, that's the reason why the Pope came here, was to push for this.
[34:30.640 --> 34:34.480]  He met with the president, he met with the Congress, he addressed and kept putting as
[34:34.480 --> 34:37.480]  the number one priority, climate change.
[34:37.480 --> 34:42.360]  And now we have global bishops calling for complete decarbonization by 2050, trying to
[34:42.360 --> 34:49.120]  build the hysteria for this coming conference in Paris, it'll be November 30th to December
[34:49.120 --> 34:50.120]  the 11th.
[34:50.120 --> 34:57.160]  Now, New American has broken this down on page 19 of the 34-page document as a call
[34:57.160 --> 35:01.640]  for establishing an international tribunal of climate justice.
[35:01.640 --> 35:06.160]  Remember the previous article that I read to you from AFP was saying, well, we have
[35:06.160 --> 35:07.160]  a question.
[35:07.160 --> 35:10.480]  Who's going to be tasked with making the country's comply?
[35:10.480 --> 35:11.480]  Well, here's your answer.
[35:11.480 --> 35:19.280]  It's going to be a tribunal of climate justice, hereby established to address cases of non-compliance.
[35:19.280 --> 35:20.280]  There you go.
[35:20.280 --> 35:24.760]  And that's going to involve, essentially, a global Supreme Court that will rule on issues
[35:24.760 --> 35:31.000]  like climate justice, climate finance, technology transfers, climate debt, climate debt.
[35:31.000 --> 35:33.160]  How are they going to indent you?
[35:33.160 --> 35:36.840]  Well, here's how that's going to work out.
[35:36.840 --> 35:42.400]  What's up with that or what's up with that is the climate blog, and they point this out.
[35:42.400 --> 35:49.080]  They say it's getting even difficult for economically illiterate leaders to swallow this.
[35:49.080 --> 35:53.040]  They say they're starting to balk at the prospect of borrowing money from China, right?
[35:53.040 --> 35:55.960]  Because they're the ones who are financing most of what we're doing.
[35:55.960 --> 35:58.200]  We're selling most of our T-bills to China.
[35:58.200 --> 36:01.240]  So anything that the federal government is going to do when spending massive amounts
[36:01.240 --> 36:05.040]  of money, massive amounts of new money that they're going to spend on this, is going to
[36:05.040 --> 36:08.880]  be financed by China, because they're the ones who are buying our debt from the Federal
[36:08.880 --> 36:09.880]  Reserve.
[36:09.880 --> 36:11.680]  So we're going to borrow this money from China.
[36:11.680 --> 36:17.800]  Then we can gift the principle that we just borrowed back to China as a climate development
[36:17.800 --> 36:19.840]  assistance.
[36:19.840 --> 36:23.520]  Then repay that loan back to China a second time with interest.
[36:23.520 --> 36:25.520]  You see how that works?
[36:25.520 --> 36:28.200]  See how they take us down very quickly?
[36:28.200 --> 36:32.720]  Because not only are they going to make us borrow the money twice and pay China twice
[36:32.720 --> 36:37.920]  with interest on this, China gets the factories and we get the shaft.
[36:37.920 --> 36:40.320]  Basically, we get the debt.
[36:40.320 --> 36:42.640]  We get the jobs closed down.
[36:42.640 --> 36:48.960]  We get high electricity rates, because this is going to be dictated from a position of
[36:48.960 --> 36:49.960]  global governance.
[36:49.960 --> 36:57.840]  Now they're pointing out this is an organization CFACT, Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow.
[36:57.840 --> 37:02.680]  They said in October 23, over 130 developing nations led by South Africa and instigated
[37:02.680 --> 37:07.360]  by China and India are insisting that they will not sign a climate agreement in Paris
[37:07.360 --> 37:13.000]  unless it contains massive redistribution of wealth from developed to poor countries.
[37:13.000 --> 37:18.960]  Now they want the power to haul the U.S. and its allies before a U.N. star chamber to enforce
[37:18.960 --> 37:19.960]  compliance.
[37:19.960 --> 37:21.520]  That's precisely what this is all about.
[37:21.520 --> 37:25.440]  There'll be a star chamber to enforce compliance, there'll be a massive transfer of wealth.
[37:25.440 --> 37:31.640]  We'll be borrowing money from China and then giving more economic credits to China and
[37:31.640 --> 37:35.080]  then paying them twice for this loan.
[37:35.080 --> 37:38.080]  Interestingly enough, Vladimir Putin is not having any of this.
[37:38.080 --> 37:43.080]  He's come out and said there is no global warming, that this is a fraud to restrain
[37:43.080 --> 37:46.160]  the industrial development of several countries including Russia.
[37:46.160 --> 37:50.520]  Yeah, it's a fraud that's being perpetrated against us, it's also being perpetrated against
[37:50.520 --> 37:55.000]  many countries where Russia is one of them, but of course our leaders are part of that
[37:55.000 --> 37:58.720]  fraud that's being perpetrated, they're in on it.
[37:58.720 --> 38:01.840]  Look at this revelation, you think you believe in man-made global warming.
[38:01.840 --> 38:06.240]  You think that the gas from pumpkins, you think that the air that we breathe out that
[38:06.240 --> 38:10.080]  is used by all plants, they breathe in carbon dioxide, you know, and then they turn out
[38:10.080 --> 38:14.400]  oxygen, that's kind of the way that it works really, folks, look it up.
[38:14.400 --> 38:18.360]  But you think that that's the problem, you think that it's man-made, the global, if you
[38:18.360 --> 38:21.960]  think that there's climate change, you think that it is man-made and of course they won't
[38:21.960 --> 38:25.320]  even say global warming anymore, they just want to say climate change because they're
[38:25.320 --> 38:27.520]  not sure if it's getting colder or warmer.
[38:27.520 --> 38:30.760]  When this all started with the first Earth Day back in 1970, we were told that we were
[38:30.760 --> 38:32.960]  headed for a news ice age.
[38:32.960 --> 38:36.520]  Now we're told that we're all going to burn, okay?
[38:36.520 --> 38:41.480]  But look at what NASA is saying, this is some new information here, this is coming from
[38:41.480 --> 38:47.280]  Epic Times and NASA says actually the Antarctic is gaining ice, gaining ice.
[38:47.280 --> 38:53.000]  They say we're looking at this and we're seeing record amounts of ice that are being shed
[38:53.000 --> 38:57.080]  that are breaking off in the Antarctic.
[38:57.080 --> 39:03.000]  But if you look at the overall picture, you find that that record breaking of ice that's
[39:03.000 --> 39:07.760]  coming out of there is because we have a record increase in ice.
[39:07.760 --> 39:12.360]  And so what NASA is saying now is that the net increase, that there is a net increase.
[39:12.360 --> 39:16.320]  So even though we're seeing a large amount of ice coming out that there's even more
[39:16.320 --> 39:17.320]  that is being made.
[39:17.320 --> 39:22.680]  According to a new analysis of satellite data, the Antarctic ice sheet showed a net gain
[39:22.680 --> 39:28.200]  of 112 billion tons of ice a year from 1992 to 2001.
[39:28.200 --> 39:34.920]  This is NASA speaking, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Jay Zwally, a glaciologist
[39:34.920 --> 39:35.920]  with NASA.
[39:35.920 --> 39:42.600]  He says that net gain slowed to 82 billion tons of ice per year between 2003 and 2008,
[39:42.600 --> 39:43.600]  but it's still increasing.
[39:43.600 --> 39:49.160]  They say we're essentially in agreement with other studies show an increase in ice discharge
[39:49.160 --> 39:50.160]  in the Antarctica.
[39:50.160 --> 39:55.640]  He says our main agreement is for east and disagreement is for east Antarctica and the
[39:55.640 --> 39:57.280]  interior of west Antarctica.
[39:57.280 --> 40:02.240]  There we see an ice gain that exceeds the losses in the other areas, do you understand
[40:02.240 --> 40:03.240]  that?
[40:03.240 --> 40:07.840]  Again, going back to what I just said, they're seeing an increase in discharge, but overall
[40:07.840 --> 40:12.680]  they're seeing a net gain in ice and that's when they're looking at it from satellite
[40:12.680 --> 40:13.680]  pictures.
[40:13.680 --> 40:18.120]  Well, there's a lot of things to be afraid of, and we have to sort out what we're going
[40:18.120 --> 40:19.120]  to be afraid of.
[40:19.120 --> 40:26.320]  Quite frankly, I'm a lot more concerned about a UN governance, a climate court, a star chamber
[40:26.320 --> 40:31.360]  that is going to enforce whatever Obama is going to unilaterally decide at the end of
[40:31.360 --> 40:33.160]  this month and the beginning of next month.
[40:33.160 --> 40:34.160]  This is only about a month away.
[40:34.160 --> 40:38.280]  What they've been building for for six years, this is coming to a climax with a pope coming
[40:38.280 --> 40:42.520]  here with everyone going to Paris for this climate summit change.
[40:42.520 --> 40:47.560]  We need to be very afraid of what is going to come out of this, but there's other areas
[40:47.560 --> 40:50.360]  that we need to be concerned about as well.
[40:50.360 --> 40:55.960]  One of those is the attack on our free speech, and it was about 10 days or so ago that we
[40:55.960 --> 41:00.240]  had Ron Paul here talking to Alex Jones, and I think it's worthwhile to listen to what
[41:00.240 --> 41:06.760]  Ron Paul said again about the attacks on free speech and to consider that the real danger
[41:06.760 --> 41:10.920]  that we see coming at us on these attacks on the First Amendment.
[41:10.920 --> 41:17.000]  There is so much I want to ask former congressman and of course medical doctor Ron Paul about
[41:17.000 --> 41:23.120]  what's happening currently in our world, the race for the speakership, the Tea Party Rebellion
[41:23.120 --> 41:31.360]  that he and others helped create, the situation in Syria, the rapidly degrading economy.
[41:31.360 --> 41:37.480]  But also political persecution, and I wanted to cover this first, Ted Cruz came out and
[41:37.480 --> 41:42.240]  said that he's worried about internet freedom, that there's major talk about censoring the
[41:42.240 --> 41:44.680]  internet in the Senate.
[41:44.680 --> 41:49.560]  Matt Drudge was on with us, giving us an exclusive interview a few weeks ago saying that he talked
[41:49.560 --> 41:54.600]  face to face with the Supreme Court Justice at dinner that said they've got the votes,
[41:54.600 --> 41:59.000]  they're coming to restrict free speech next year.
[41:59.000 --> 42:03.840]  Hillary has now announced that if she's elected she will try for a national gun buyback and
[42:03.840 --> 42:05.960]  a repeal of the Second Amendment.
[42:05.960 --> 42:12.640]  That's actually a quote, so the statements are very bold right now and we're seeing massive
[42:12.640 --> 42:17.360]  continued IRS persecution of conservative and libertarian groups.
[42:17.360 --> 42:23.280]  I wanted to not so much ask Ron Paul his view of this, I mean I want to do that, I also
[42:23.280 --> 42:27.680]  wanted to ask him what we should do, I mean I think it shows how effective the liberty
[42:27.680 --> 42:34.840]  movement is that the system wants to silence us, but at the same time I think we have to
[42:34.840 --> 42:41.160]  address this and really discuss how we're supposed to respond to it because Matt Drudge
[42:41.160 --> 42:45.320]  said he's been told by high-level government folks the persecution is about to kick into
[42:45.320 --> 42:46.320]  high gear.
[42:46.320 --> 42:49.680]  Okay, hey Ron, we're going to be right back and we're going to have Ron Paul's response

[01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:18.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:26.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:32.000]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show on this November 1st, 2015, I'm David Knight, your host.
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:40.000]  Alex Jones was just breaking down what's going on in the Middle East using Islamic jihadists as surrogates.
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:45.000]  And of course, that's what's going on internally inside of Europe as well.
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:53.000]  And we have a lot of migrants coming into this country with our open borders that are not just coming from Central and South America for the same purpose.
[01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:58.000]  And I want to get back to that as well as this story about what's going on in Germany.
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:06.000]  Because Germany has been set up by Angela Merkel as the pot of gold incentivizing this mass migration of many people coming in.
[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:14.000]  That opens up the borders to this massive number of people coming into Europe going through the Balkan states.
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:17.000]  But the ultimate destination is Sweden and Germany.
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:21.000]  That's where they will find the socialist welfare state most welcoming.
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:32.000]  They had an article on Infowars.com, and it was in French, but the French people heard Muslims who were singing jihadi songs.
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:41.000]  And the French people there were applauding them, welcoming them and not understanding at all what is going on, what's behind all of this.
[01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000]  And so we're going to try to break that down for you.
[01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:48.000]  It's a multifaceted agenda, but it is all about globalism.
[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:53.000]  I want to get back to that, but first before we do, I want to let you know that we have supermail vitality back in stock.
[01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:57.000]  You can find that at Infowarslife.com.
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:01.000]  It's something that sells out very quickly, but right now, supermail vitality is in stock.
[01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:07.000]  The Ultra Strength formula with organic herbs and acids that will help to increase your energy.
[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:11.000]  You can read the reviews there at Infowarslife.com.
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:14.000]  We also have 25% off the liver cleanse pack.
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:22.000]  That special is about to run out, and again, the liver cleanse pack is liver shield as well as the oxygen colon cleanser oxy powder.
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:29.000]  You can get two of those together and get that at 25% off at Infowarslife.com.
[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:37.000]  Now what we were just talking about, what's going on using jihadis, using people who are noncombatants as shields.
[01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:45.000]  That really kind of goes back to what we were talking about last week with the pushback saying that the Russians had attacked.
[01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:51.000]  First, it was just a couple hospitals, and they said, well, it's three to five hospitals and seven to nine hospitals.
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:55.000]  And the Russians came back and said, show us, show us your evidence for this.
[01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000]  You're making these claims, show us the evidence.
[01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:05.000]  I believe that it was a pushback against the sustained attack on a hospital by U.S. and Afghan forces in Kunduz.
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000]  That went on for a half hour.
[01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:12.000]  It was a hospital that was known, that was reported to both the Afghan and the U.S. government.
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:17.000]  And as that attack began, it wasn't an isolated stray bomb attack.
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000]  No, this was a sustained attack for 30 minutes.
[01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:27.000]  And as that went on, both the Pentagon as well as the Afghan government were notified that the attack was happening, but it was a sustained attack.
[01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000]  So they took a lot of international hits for that.
[01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:40.000]  And I think the American government and NATO forces pushed back with some claims that they have not substantiated about attacks on hospitals by Russians in Syria.
[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:44.000]  Instead of fixing it again, they attack the whistleblowers.
[01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:50.000]  They don't ever change the criminal actions or even apologize for it.
[01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:54.000]  They're not even setting up an investigation of this, as doctors without borders have asked.
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:55.000]  That's all they wanted.
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000]  They didn't want a war crimes prosecution.
[01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:58.000]  They just wanted an investigation.
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:23:59.000]  Give us answers.
[01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:00.000]  How could this have happened?
[01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000]  Why would you do a sustained attack instead?
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000]  What they did was they showed up at the site.
[01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:05.000]  They destroyed evidence.
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:12.000]  And then they created a narrative that the Russian forces had been attacking hospitals in a similar manner.
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:19.000]  Look at what's going on in Germany, because it's not just in Syria where they're using jihadi forces as surrogates in a war there.
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:32.000]  Of course, they're using Islamic migrants coming out of Syria, but also coming out of many other places in the Middle East, using them as surrogates for what we know as a clowered and pivot strategy.
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:42.000]  Remember, those were the two sociologists from the 1960s that wanted to overload the entitlement system specifically to cause a crash so that they could build their socialist utopia.
[01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:49.000]  You would think, wouldn't you, that socialists would want to have an entitlement system that works? No, they deliberately wanted to overload it.
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:54.000]  Well, what better way to do that than to bring in massive numbers of people?
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:57.000]  And of course, this is exactly what we're seeing in Germany.
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:02.000]  A German village of 102 braces for 750 asylum seekers.
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:03.000]  It was originally 1,000.
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:11.000]  They were told in early October, the district government informed the mayor of this small town by email that his village of 102 people just over the border
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:17.000]  of what was once communist East Germany would have to take in 1,000 asylum seekers.
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:20.000]  His wife told the mayor, said, this has got to be a hoax.
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000]  This certainly can't be true.
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:27.000]  Such a small, isolated place would be asked to accommodate nearly 10 times as many migrants as it had residents.
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000]  She thought it was a joke, he said, but it wasn't.
[01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000]  This is a report from the New York Times.
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:37.000]  They say, in a small concession, the regional office told them last week that, no, you won't have to take 1,000.
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000]  We'll limit that to 750.
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:42.000]  So it won't be 10 times the number of people that live there.
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:45.000]  We'll just send in eight times the number of people that live there.
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:52.000]  They say the only person, in fact, that seems to be enthusiastic about this plan is a neo-Nazi on the district council.
[01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:59.000]  He says, this is bad for the people, but politically it's good for me because he knows that people are going to get angry about this.
[01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000]  But the German government doesn't care.
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000]  People understand, the fix is in.
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:09.000]  People understand that they're trying to pull down the government, not only in Germany, but in the United States.
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:17.000]  But most of our elected leaders, people that are running for office even now, most of the Republicans and Democrats could care less about this.
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:22.000]  Now they go on and point out the small town of Sumte has no shops, no police station, no school.
[01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:31.000]  The initial number of arrivals was, in fact, reduced to avoid straining the local sewage system and give time for new pumps to be installed.
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:35.000]  Yeah, yeah, that's a literal when it hits the fan scenario.
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000]  And that's what they're creating.
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:42.000]  This article from W&D talks about thousands of Muslim migrants who've disappeared now from the camp.
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000]  So here's this little town that has 100 people.
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:47.000]  They have to take in 750 migrants.
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:51.000]  But these migrants are disappearing from the larger centers.
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:57.000]  They point out that in Brandenburg shelters, 7000 migrants have disappeared.
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000]  So where are they going? Who's sheltering the illegals?
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:00.000]  Do they have ties to ISIS?
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000]  They don't know.
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:07.000]  Then a newspaper, Develt, is reporting that thousands of refugees have left their assigned accommodations elsewhere.
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:13.000]  They say on Wednesday alone, more than 600 people left the welcoming center in another area.
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:16.000]  And the Potsdam Ministry of the Interior reported this.
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:21.000]  The German news outlet FOS.net had lined refugees disappearing from lodging.
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000]  This is in lower Saxony.
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:26.000]  They said 700 refugees disappeared from emergency accommodations there.
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:30.000]  So all over the country, these migrants who are coming in,
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:34.000]  and many people question whether they're fleeing from the war in Syria.
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000]  They're coming from different places.
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:37.000]  They're all about the same.
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:40.000]  These are not families, but mostly young men that are coming in.
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000]  So what is the solution to this?
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:48.000]  Well, they're now being told that the UN is partnering with a private company to offer a solution.
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000]  See, problem solution.
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:51.000]  Here's their solution.
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:57.000]  A new universal identification system that will comply with the UN's sustainability goal
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:03.000]  of getting legal biometric IDs that include iris scans, photographs, and fingerprints
[01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:07.000]  into, quote, the hands of everyone in the world by the year 2050.
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:13.000]  Yeah, they're going to get into your hands and they're going to record the hands of everyone in the world by 2050.
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:18.000]  So over and over again, we see that they're using this crisis
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:22.000]  in order to bring in their solution.
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:28.000]  And the Prime Minister of Hungary has specifically called out George Soros.
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:35.000]  He said, Soros' name is perhaps the strongest example of those who support anything that weakens the nation states.
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:38.000]  They support everything that changes the traditional European lifestyle.
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:43.000]  These activists who support immigrants and inadvertently become part of the International Human Smuggling Network
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:46.000]  know it's about taking down national borders.
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000]  When we come back, I'm going to take some of your calls.
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:53.000]  877-789-Alex, that's 2539.

[01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:29.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:35.000]  I'm David Knight, your host on this Sunday, November 1st, 2015.
[01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000]  We're going to go to your calls here in just a moment.
[01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000]  The number is 877-789-ALAX.
[01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:45.000]  That's 877-789-2539 if you'd like to call in with a comment this last half hour.
[01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:49.000]  Before we do, I want to continue with what I was just talking about just briefly.
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:52.000]  Again, the situation where you have thousands,
[01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:58.000]  literally thousands of migrants who have come into Germany for the welfare system
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:01.000]  or some of them would be escaping what's going on in Syria,
[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:06.000]  but most of them are between the ages of 18 and 25 and they're disappearing by the thousands.
[01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:12.000]  So the solution that they're telling everybody is a UN-approved biometric tracking device.
[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:16.000]  We see that solution being applied to here in the United States.
[01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:20.000]  We have open borders. They're not going to do anything about the incentives to bring people in.
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000]  They're not going to try to close or enforce the borders.
[01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:26.000]  Instead, what they're going to do is offer us all a national identity.
[01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000]  That's going to be the solution they're going to come up with.
[01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000]  You can see this article on infowars.com.
[01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:35.000]  Coming soon from the Department of Transportation, a national address database
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:40.000]  and insights into the way that you drive personally.
[01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:46.000]  Now this is coming from Next.gov. They report the Department of Transportation Chief Technology Officer,
[01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:50.000]  Maria Rohit, is talking and she says that they're collecting information.
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:56.000]  It's a multi-year effort to gather information about driving patterns using onboard sensors and video cameras.
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:00.000]  These tests have generated four petabytes of data, she said.
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:05.000]  They're collected from test drivers who spend about a million hours and about 2,000 cars.
[01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:10.000]  Well, they're going to be collecting that data real-time on everybody before too long.
[01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:15.000]  They're putting out regulations for vehicle-to-vehicle communication, talking cars.
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:19.000]  And they're going to be talking and broadcasting information about you.
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:22.000]  Who you are, where you are, what you're doing, how you drive.
[01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:25.000]  What do you think the government's going to do with that information?
[01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:30.000]  Hey kids, insurance rates? Of course. But there's other things as well.
[01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:39.000]  She says in this article that she updated the audience on DOT's attempts to build a national database containing citizens' addresses.
[01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:44.000]  She says, I don't think people realize we don't have any national address database yet.
[01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:52.000]  What are they going to do? Well, they're going to work with the Census Bureau and with geospatial agencies to create one.
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:56.000]  Geospatial agencies, who would that be? Geospatial Intel.
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:01.000]  Are you familiar with that term? We talked about that in light of Jade Helm. Everybody said, well, you know, what's this about?
[01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:09.000]  What's mastering the human domain? Well, geospatial intelligence organizations, trade organizations have run conferences on mastering the human domain.
[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:15.000]  They want to know your activity-based intelligence. They want to know where you go, who you see, what you do.
[01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:24.000]  They're going to have to collect that using information on the literal information highway when they start spying on you on the roads.
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:34.000]  Of course, the ultimate goal is human control. Controlling your car or other legislation like gun control, that's not about controlling inanimate objects.
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:41.000]  This is not about even self-driving cars. This is about making sure that they control your movements, that they track your movements.
[01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000]  That's what we should be concerned about.
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:47.000]  Then, of course, the open borders are the means to drive people to it.
[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:57.000]  Just as the open borders combined with an entitlement state, the two of them work together like Thelma and Louise to accelerate the car over the cliff economically.
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:58.000]  That's where this is all headed.
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:10.000]  Now, before we get to your calls, again, there's a couple of things that I wanted to talk about because we've had some movements here with some billionaires making their moves as to which candidates are going to support.
[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:20.000]  You need to understand that we had this back and forth about fantasy football on the debate the other day, and there was a question to Jeb Bush about whether or not that should be regulated.
[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:29.000]  Then, of course, his response is always, oh, yes, it should be regulated. He doesn't have any specifics, but his knee-jerk reaction to all this is, yes, there should be a law.
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:36.000]  Remember that? That kind of attitude has what's gotten us into the kind of society we have today.
[01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:44.000]  I remember there was a time when I was very young, people had, there was an expression in America called, well, it's a free country, isn't it? Do what you want, right?
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:49.000]  You don't hear that anymore, but that was replaced by, yeah, there ought to be a law against that.
[01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000]  Well, you know, that's kind of what Jeb Bush came back.
[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:57.000]  And then you had Chris Christie saying, I can't believe all the problems that we've got that we're talking about fantasy football.
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:07.000]  It was a very powerful moment, very powerful, except that, as Huffington Post points out, Chris Christie raised funds off of fantasy football just last month.
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:11.000]  They have a link to his fundraiser off of fantasy football, so he's not above using that.
[01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:14.000]  But you know what? It's not even really about fantasy football.
[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:18.000]  It was, part of that was about gambling, online gambling.
[01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:25.000]  And of course, that was him posturing himself for support from Sheldon Adelson.
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:28.000]  Sheldon Adelson is a big casino owner in Nevada.
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:34.000]  He's a big player in the Republican Party, and he is against any kind of online gambling.
[01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:37.000]  And that would include fantasy football or fantasy sports.
[01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:40.000]  He wants everybody to do all of their gambling at his casinos.
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:45.000]  He doesn't like to have any competition from any kind of recreational vice.
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:49.000]  That's one of the reasons that he opposed even medical marijuana in Florida.
[01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:53.000]  And of course, Jeb and Marco Rubio were opposing it along with him.
[01:38:53.000 --> 01:39:00.000]  He was virtually the entire budget of the opposition to medical marijuana.
[01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:04.000]  And that's what they're doing in order to get his support.
[01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:08.000]  They talk about the Sheldon primary, the amount of money that he's going to give whoever he chooses.
[01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:13.000]  Well, Marco Rubio has landed a big billionaire.
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:17.000]  And this is very important because you need to understand that you may be following politics,
[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:20.000]  but you're really kind of doing it in a fantasy football way.
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:24.000]  It's really the billionaires who own the players. You just pay for the stadium.
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000]  That's your only involvement.
[01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:29.000]  So you can kind of watch passively. You can pay for the stadium,
[01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000]  but they're going to pick the players.
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:34.000]  And there was a New Yorker satire about this.
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:40.000]  Billionaire Peter Paul Singer has thrown his support to Marco Rubio for president.
[01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:44.000]  And the way they reported it was billionaire acquires Rubio pending physical.
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:48.000]  They say in the biggest free agency acquisition of the 2016 presidential contest,
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:52.000]  a billionaire investor Paul Singer has acquired Florida Senator Marco Rubio
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:56.000]  for a rumored eight-figure sum pending a physical.
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:00.000]  Just hours after the deal was inked, Rubio was flown by private jet to Singer's training facility
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:05.000]  in East Hampton where the senator will submit to a series of grueling drills
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000]  before the deal is finalized.
[01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:10.000]  We're making a four-year deal with Marco with an option for another four,
[01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:13.000]  said an associate of singers. We like what we've seen of him on tape,
[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:16.000]  but we want to be sure that he has what it takes to go the distance.
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:19.000]  And those familiar with Singer's physical workouts for political candidates,
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:22.000]  Rubio will submit to a series of demanding tests
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:25.000]  in which the billionaire will bark commands and the senator will be measured
[01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000]  for his reaction times and his accuracy.
[01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:32.000]  In other words, how high he'll be able to jump when the billionaire barks the commands to him.
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:36.000]  And so I thought that was a great satire piece.
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:39.000]  But you know what? It's really true, unfortunately.
[01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:43.000]  Because the serious piece doesn't read that much differently from the New York Times.
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:47.000]  Paul Singer, influential billionaire, throws a support to Marco Rubio for president.
[01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:51.000]  They say it's a signal victory for Rubio in his battle with rival Jeb Bush
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:57.000]  for the affections of major Republican patrons.
[01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:02.000]  And as they point out, Rubio, who was elected to the Senate in the Tea Party wave,
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:08.000]  has since, however, been embraced by the party's Washington elite.
[01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:11.000]  See, he was brought in to help change things.
[01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:14.000]  That's what the Tea Party was really about.
[01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:19.000]  It was about pushing back on crony capitalism on the way that it's business as usual
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:22.000]  with the Banners and McConnell's and Pelosi's.
[01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:23.000]  And what do we get?
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:27.000]  We get the Paul Ryan O's. We get the Marco Rubio's.
[01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:28.000]  That's what we get.
[01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:35.000]  And we get people like this billionaire whose major issues are being passionately pro-Israel
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:39.000]  and a supporter of same-sex marriage, those core Republican issues.
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000]  There you go.
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:45.000]  And again, like Sheldon Adelson, he is a pro-Israel supporter
[01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:51.000]  and somebody who wants to shut down all competition to his gambling.
[01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:55.000]  It's been said that an election is an advanced auction of stolen goods,
[01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000]  and that's precisely what this is.
[01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:01.000]  And when you look at the rest of the field, it isn't much better.
[01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000]  We look at Ted Cruz, the Washington Post pointed out,
[01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:07.000]  for all of his bashing of billionaire Republican donors who actively despise our base.
[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:13.000]  The anti-establishment senator from Texas is being bolstered by his own robust base of wealthy contributors.
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:20.000]  Cruz raised $5.2 million through the end of September from supporters who gave him the $2,700 maximum,
[01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:26.000]  making him number two in the GOP race for large donors, following only behind Jeb.
[01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000]  We'll see, it's not working out too well for Jeb.
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:33.000]  And one of the reasons that Jeb is having to lay off staff and can't pay the staff
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:38.000]  is because he doesn't have any control of the super fund money.
[01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000]  That's where the billionaires are really putting their money.
[01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:44.000]  Nobody is contributing directly to his campaign individuals.
[01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:47.000]  Instead, it's the super PACs.
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:51.000]  That's where he got hundreds of millions of dollars, but he doesn't control that.
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:52.000]  He can't pay his staff from it.
[01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:53.000]  And you know what?
[01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:56.000]  He can't control what they're going to tell him to do.
[01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:57.000]  He's in their control.
[01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:00.000]  Say whether it's when we come back, we're going to go right to your phone calls.
[01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:05.000]  That's what is going on in the world without logging into the Internet ghettos of Facebook
[01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:06.000]  and Twitter.

[01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:38.000]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:39.000]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:43.000]  We have one more segment and I want to get to as many phone calls as we can.
[01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000]  I want to go through these quickly.
[01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000]  Let's go to Mark in San Jose.
[01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:53.000]  Mark, you said you have a breaking story about a young girl that was beaten in the area.
[01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000]  You're killing them, David.
[01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:56.000]  You people rocked.
[01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:59.000]  Everyone on Infowars absolutely rocked.
[01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:00.000]  Oh, thank you.
[01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:01.000]  Keep it up.
[01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000]  No, thank you.
[01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:04.000]  And thank all you people.
[01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000]  I'm telling you.
[01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000]  But there's this story.
[01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:09.000]  NBC got it right for once.
[01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:12.000]  There's somebody decent that works for NBC.
[01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:17.000]  There's a guy named Vicky Nguyen here in San Jose and she was interviewing this mother
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:23.000]  who, oh my, her 40-year-old kid was placed into this foster home, right?
[01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:29.000]  And they found bite marks all over her body, burn marks, bruises.
[01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:32.000]  And she took a picture, a hundred pictures, David.
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:39.000]  Went to the CPS and the child by the, oh my, the social workers and showed them the pictures
[01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:42.000]  and they basically waved her onto that, get out of here.
[01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:43.000]  We don't want to hear about it.
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000]  I mean, it's incredible.
[01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:50.000]  And so I called the tip line and can I give my last name at NBC?
[01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:53.000]  Is it okay if I give my last name?
[01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:58.000]  Um, well, was that, yeah, it'd be better if you didn't.
[01:48:58.000 --> 01:48:59.000]  It'd be better if you didn't.
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:00.000]  Yeah.
[01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000]  Just because it might be, you know, just because we can't verify that.
[01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:03.000]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:04.000]  Yeah.
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:05.000]  Okay.
[01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:09.000]  Well, the Denver City Council, I'm fairly well known as a, uh, as the right-hand candidate
[01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000]  in, I think it was 210.
[01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:17.000]  But anyway, I left the tip on the NBC tip line to call me because I know this private investigator
[01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:23.000]  named Doug Millar that for 23 years he's, uh, investigated crimes against children covered
[01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000]  up by law enforcement.
[01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:31.000]  And if they can interview Doug Millar, it will blow this case wide open because he also worked
[01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:35.000]  with Senator John DeKamp who wrote the Franklin cover up.
[01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:38.000]  I know Alec Jones, Senator John DeKamp.
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:44.000]  And this thing is Nancy Schaefer was the reason Nancy Schaefer was killed was she had decided
[01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:49.000]  to totally demolish the child protective services in Georgia because she found out they were
[01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:52.000]  filled full of pedophiles and raping.
[01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:53.000]  Yeah.
[01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:57.000]  Well, just like what happened in the UK, you know, we've had situations there with, um,
[01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:02.000]  the comedian and, um, and I'm, I'm drawing a blank on his name right now, multiple cover-ups
[01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:05.000]  by both the BBC as well as Scotland Yard.
[01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000]  People lower down would start to investigate it.
[01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:10.000]  And then people higher up would shut down the investigation or shut down the reporting.
[01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000]  And so we see that happening over and over again.
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000]  Or look at the situation with Dennis Hastert.
[01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:18.000]  I mean, we see people complaining about the fact that they came after him and got him for,
[01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:21.000]  they prosecuted him for withdrawing his own money.
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:22.000]  Okay.
[01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:25.000]  I understand that is not, should not be a crime.
[01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:31.000]  But the narrative that we're being fed is that this guy supposedly was a child molester.
[01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:34.000]  They was being blackmailed for something that he did when he was a high school coach.
[01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:40.000]  But then decades after that, he somehow became completely sanitized when he became a congressman.
[01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:41.000]  Are you kidding me?
[01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:42.000]  Are you kidding me?
[01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000]  That never happens with child pedophiles.
[01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:49.000]  That's why we have a sex registry because we want to record particularly child pedophiles
[01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000]  because we know that they never stop.
[01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:56.000]  They never stop, but of course we have this statute of limitations that keeps them from being prosecuted.
[01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:01.000]  So there's a lot of stuff that's going on in high places in the US government.
[01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:05.000]  And I think if we looked beyond this plea bargaining deal with Dennis Hastert,
[01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:09.000]  we would see something that has been going on in the last couple of decades while he's there.
[01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000]  This is a guy who was a high school coach.
[01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000]  He had no net worth when he became a congressman essentially.
[01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:18.000]  And then he leaves after 20 years, about $18 million, $17 or $18 million.
[01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:23.000]  He's making like a million dollars a year increased net after all of his expenses.
[01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:26.000]  I mean, the salary is only a little over $100,000 to be a congressman,
[01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:29.000]  but this guy made a million dollars a year.
[01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:30.000]  What's going on with that?
[01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:31.000]  That's a whole other level.
[01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000]  So yeah, thank you, Mark.
[01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:34.000]  Keep in touch with us.
[01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000]  Send a tip to the writers as this develops.
[01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:39.000]  If this looks like this is something that is systemic,
[01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:42.000]  and we've seen that over and over again with CPS.
[01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:43.000]  Thank you for calling.
[01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:46.000]  I want to give some of the other callers a chance to get in.
[01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:47.000]  Let's go to Taylor in Michigan.
[01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:50.000]  You had some information about refugees in Hanover, Germany.
[01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:51.000]  Go ahead.
[01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:56.000]  Yeah, I just came across an article on beforesnews.com,
[01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:59.000]  and it's a new video that just came out.
[01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:05.000]  It really portrays the cloud-tiven nature of de-bulkenization in Europe right now.
[01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:09.000]  It shows Muslim migrants in the streets of Hanover, Germany,
[01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:15.000]  marching through the streets with the ISIS flag, claiming the land for a law.
[01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:21.000]  And showing their true colors now that they've gained asylum.
[01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:26.000]  Oh yeah, we have an article on info wars today where they are doing the same thing,
[01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000]  essentially, in France.
[01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000]  But the French people that are there are pro-immigration,
[01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:31.000]  and they're applauding them,
[01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:34.000]  and they don't even understand that they're singing jihadi songs,
[01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000]  and we're going to take you over and so forth.
[01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000]  And so they don't even understand what this is about.
[01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:44.000]  I mean, it's a perfect metaphor for how clueless the people who support these open borders really are.
[01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:45.000]  They don't understand what's going on.
[01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000]  They don't understand the immediate consequences of it,
[01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:50.000]  and they don't understand the bigger picture.
[01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:53.000]  That is to use open borders, to use the entitlement state,
[01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:58.000]  to take down the various nation-states so that everyone is taken down to the lowest level,
[01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:02.000]  and that allows the people like George Soros to run through this globalist agenda.
[01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000]  Was there anything else you wanted to add, Taylor?
[01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:07.000]  I can give you the title of the article if you want.
[01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:10.000]  That's okay. We'll look that up, but thanks for pointing that out.
[01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:15.000]  Let's go to Truth Raider. You had a comment about the Department of Transportation. Go ahead.
[01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:19.000]  Hey, David, next time you come up to the Multnomah Valley,
[01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:24.000]  give your friend, Truth Raider, an email at truthraider2150mail.com,
[01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:27.000]  and I'll give you a tour of the Multnomah Valley.
[01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000]  Okay, great. That'd be great.
[01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:34.000]  Yeah, I love that. We went up there for vacation, and it was a beautiful area up there.
[01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000]  You had something about the Department of Transportation?
[01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:37.000]  Yes.
[01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:42.000]  Well, while I'm being railroaded, I had my truck impounded yesterday,
[01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:48.000]  and they arrested me at the scene because I didn't provide a physical ID.
[01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:52.000]  I mean, your name, address, and birthday does not count.
[01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:53.000]  Wow.
[01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:56.000]  Yeah, so, but they released me at the scene because I informed them,
[01:53:56.000 --> 01:54:00.000]  if you do transport me to jail, that is kidnapping.
[01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:05.000]  So they decided not to do so, but they did impound my truck.
[01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:10.000]  Prior to that, they went through it, and they searched illegally
[01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:13.000]  in violation of my Fourth Amendment right.
[01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:17.000]  You said they've impounded it as just a civil asset forfeiture situation?
[01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000]  Well, not yet. I can go get it out.
[01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:22.000]  I can go get it out if I come up with the funds,
[01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:26.000]  come up with a ransom, more or less, to support their system.
[01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:31.000]  So I wanted to just let you know what's going on with that.
[01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:35.000]  It's a shame, and we've got an article on infowars.com today.
[01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:38.000]  Justice Scalia warns the U.S. Supreme Court is causing the destruction
[01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:41.000]  of our democratic system, and it's not anything new.
[01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:45.000]  The only thing is, Scalia is saying these recent decisions on gay marriage
[01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:48.000]  and federally subsidized health insurance, they have absolutely no basis
[01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000]  in the Constitution, no basis in law.
[01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:53.000]  Would you agree with them or not? They have no basis in the law.
[01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:57.000]  This is the idea that we have a living document here, the U.S. Constitution.
[01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:00.000]  But I would say that this isn't a slippery slope that started.
[01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:03.000]  It's something that we've been living with for nearly 50 years,
[01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000]  at least with the war on drugs.
[01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:08.000]  And of course, you can point out with other agencies doing similar things
[01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:13.000]  to the DEA, basically destroying the 4th, 5th, 6th Amendment.
[01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:17.000]  And just having the war on drugs is a complete violation of the Constitution.
[01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:20.000]  There's absolutely nothing in the Constitution that gives the government
[01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000]  the power to prohibit anything.
[01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:27.000]  Why else would they need to have had an amendment to the Constitution
[01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:30.000]  to prohibit alcohol? I mean, at one point in time,
[01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:34.000]  we did have people in Washington that at least had respect for the document
[01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:37.000]  they swore to. Today, they just ignore it wholesale.
[01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:40.000]  And that's what's happening if they can arrest you, truth raider,
[01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:45.000]  just for not producing a physical ID, but we see that type of thing all along.
[01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:50.000]  Let's go to Ronnie in Spicewood. Ronnie?
[01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:57.000]  Sure. Thank you much. Dr. Rand Paul is now getting a full blast Dr. Ron Paul treatment,
[01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000]  you know, by the lame scheme media.
[01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:03.000]  And number one, the first thing they entirely ignore him,
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000]  Dr. Rand Paul's candidacy.
[01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:08.000]  And let's ignore his ideas.
[01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:12.000]  And among these include, of course, Dr. Rand Paul actually fell buster
[01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:17.000]  against the absurdly counterproductive NDAA, thankfully, you know, at best anyway.
[01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:20.000]  But he did, you know, more niche here to stand up to it.
[01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:26.000]  And he stands up to our own military industrial banks to media, you know,
[01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:29.000]  complex of criminals take over of our entire world.
[01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:32.000]  That's, I mean, that's why they hate him.
[01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:39.000]  He's the one elected official who actually has the guts to stand up to these truly evil forces.
[01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:42.000]  Exactly. He's pulled up some of the issues that other candidates are not talking about.
[01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:46.000]  And that alone would be a great reason to continue his candidacy.
[01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:50.000]  Unfortunately, I mean, what do you think about these ridiculous presidential debates?
[01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000]  So they never get into anything of substance.
[01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:55.000]  They don't even talk about the traditional things that they've talked about,
[01:56:55.000 --> 01:57:00.000]  what, you know, which are focused on what they're going to do to cut spending.
[01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000]  They didn't even talk about any spending cuts.
[01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:03.000]  I was very disappointed.
[01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:04.000]  You're talking about Rand Paul.
[01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:07.000]  I was disappointed that the only spending cut that any of the candidates could come up with
[01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:10.000]  were the things to cut social security benefits.
[01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:14.000]  And quite frankly, I see that as a contract that they have had with people
[01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:17.000]  when they confiscate your income for your entire working life.
[01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000]  They say, we're going to give you some pension benefits.
[01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:22.000]  I think it is criminal and fraudulent to take those away.
[01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:25.000]  Your comment quickly, because we're about out of time.
[01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000]  Yeah, I completely agree on that.
[01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:32.000]  But Dr. Rand Paul is just getting a really poor treatment of his ideas.
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000]  And he does have some. He just, you know...
[01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:37.000]  He has some great ideas, especially on civil liberties,
[01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000]  especially on the Constitution and limited government.
[01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000]  Well, that's all the time we have today.
[01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:45.000]  We'll be back again tomorrow at 11 Central, noon Eastern for the Alex Jones Show.
[01:57:45.000 --> 01:58:14.000]  Alex Jones will be back here in the studio.
