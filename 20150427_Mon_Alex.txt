[00:00.000 --> 00:14.720]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.720 --> 00:35.440]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones well it's already April 27th
[00:35.440 --> 00:42.320]  2015 I'm your host Alex Jones and this will be just an over-the-top transmission today so many of
[00:42.320 --> 00:49.200]  the dots are now being connected top professor who first documented decades ago that more guns
[00:49.200 --> 00:56.640]  means less crime John lot will be joining us for 30 minutes in the second hour Joe Gilbert was on
[00:56.640 --> 01:01.440]  about two weeks ago it had breaking news with world net daily it was set to come up the next day
[01:01.440 --> 01:06.000]  but it was so big that they continue to develop the story of the last week and a half two weeks
[01:06.000 --> 01:14.800]  he'll be breaking that information on Obama here today coming up as Obama's half brother tells all
[01:15.840 --> 01:26.640]  with us today during the third hour for 30 minutes as well that said just incredible
[01:26.640 --> 01:35.200]  information to cover obviously the mayor of Baltimore Maryland has come out and admitted
[01:35.200 --> 01:42.800]  that the police stood down and let the rioting looters attack police cars attack businesses
[01:42.800 --> 01:49.120]  attack other vehicles and attack reporters and citizens and then the police were caught by the
[01:49.120 --> 01:58.000]  associated press being ordered to target legitimate reporters because they didn't want them there to
[01:58.000 --> 02:05.040]  show there was a stand down and the spin is oh let people riot they let off steam no that's
[02:05.040 --> 02:11.440]  how you cause it's well known in mass movements and mob psychology that if you let a riot get going
[02:12.080 --> 02:15.440]  a lot of times it gets out of control and if anybody knows that it's like a fire
[02:16.080 --> 02:20.480]  you let a fire get going it could spread i mean that's that's no brainer you you put it out
[02:21.760 --> 02:27.600]  unless you want civil unrest but frankly over abortion and then going after our guns and open
[02:27.600 --> 02:33.040]  borders we legitimately could have civil unrest right now but it shouldn't be shops and random police
[02:33.040 --> 02:39.680]  cars are shooting cops in the head who are just as dumb down as the general public civil unrest ought
[02:39.680 --> 02:48.800]  to be against the actual controllers the usurpers let me just bring a point up here in operation
[02:48.800 --> 02:56.000]  valkyrie did the german officers go after a cop in the street did they go break a window out of a
[02:56.000 --> 03:03.680]  cafe did they mug a reporter no they went after adolf headler now i'm not advocating going after
[03:03.680 --> 03:08.560]  obama because he's a puppet in the front man but the public's so dumb down i have to destroy that
[03:08.560 --> 03:16.560]  demigod that front man that that branding like nbc was branded by brian williams he was their face
[03:17.280 --> 03:22.400]  obama is the face of the liberal fascist oh by the way there's a video clip i forgot to give you
[03:22.400 --> 03:27.600]  guys ted cruz came out and branded them liberal fascist that is exactly what they are because
[03:27.600 --> 03:35.200]  they're not liberals at all they're fascists by every real indicator so is the republican party
[03:35.200 --> 03:43.840]  leadership george w bush has broken the silence and come out and attacked obama that will make
[03:43.840 --> 03:50.880]  obama's numbers go up and then when he attacks hillary for his brother he's so hated that'll make
[03:50.880 --> 03:56.640]  hillary look good and that's exactly what they're planning the clintons and the bushes are as
[03:56.640 --> 04:01.360]  thick as thieves they always have been it was george herbert walker bush when he was the head
[04:01.360 --> 04:08.560]  of the cia that was the handler of uh hillary and bill i've had former top cia folks on direct
[04:08.560 --> 04:13.200]  that down we know both were in the cia based in london while george herbert walker bush was the
[04:13.200 --> 04:24.160]  director of the central intelligence agency under under who under richard millhouse nixon
[04:27.440 --> 04:32.880]  the fix is in boys and girls the fix is in unless we realize there's a fix and the polls
[04:32.880 --> 04:43.120]  across the board show everyone is sick of the bushes and the clintons it's all going to be
[04:43.120 --> 04:47.520]  documented today steven honking says humanity won't survive another thousand years unless it
[04:47.520 --> 04:54.000]  escapes earth this is the steven honking warns new video show sentencing cops and national
[04:54.000 --> 04:58.640]  guard and riot control exercise and everybody has to take vaccines in australia but the prime minister
[04:58.640 --> 05:04.320]  not a single eleventh grade student showed up to take the sbac common core standardized test
[05:04.320 --> 05:09.120]  at nathan hill high school last week but students aren't the only ones walking out on common core
[05:09.120 --> 05:12.880]  earlier this year teachers at the same school passed a resolution against the common core
[05:12.880 --> 05:17.120]  standardized tests and were threatened by superintendent larry nylan with the loss of
[05:17.120 --> 05:21.120]  their teaching license if they didn't administer the test according to the seattle education
[05:21.120 --> 05:25.600]  blog liberty high school in west virginia is proactively warning students parents that their
[05:25.600 --> 05:30.560]  child will be suspended if they opt out of upcoming common core testing superintendent mark manchin
[05:30.560 --> 05:35.360]  even called into a radio show to levy even more socialist brainwashing rhetoric parents don't
[05:35.360 --> 05:39.280]  have the right to pick and choose what provisions of public education in which they feel they want
[05:39.280 --> 05:43.440]  to comply with he said technical issues are plaguing the common core testing industry even
[05:43.440 --> 05:47.760]  worse than student walkouts the washington post reports that over 15 states are suspending
[05:47.760 --> 05:52.320]  scrapping or reviewing common core standards for a variety of reasons maybe the computers are having

[09:47.760 --> 09:53.920]  every day because it's true but i get in here now and go over the news and it is just over the top
[09:54.880 --> 10:00.080]  confirming the globalist master plan that they wrote about and talked about and gave speeches
[10:00.080 --> 10:05.920]  about for decades it's just showing they really mean what they say but at the same time to see the
[10:05.920 --> 10:13.520]  mounting resistance to it is bullying a very uplifting but to also see some people falling
[10:13.520 --> 10:20.880]  to the propaganda is very nauseating so it is the best of times the worst of times it's all over the
[10:20.880 --> 10:30.800]  top look at this headline from john rapaport at info wars dot com and this is from the major australian
[10:30.800 --> 10:40.400]  newspaper australia everyone must get vaccinated except the prime minister's daughters and it turns
[10:40.400 --> 10:47.120]  out the prime minister who by the way is anti un anti carbon tax been trying to even reverse some
[10:47.120 --> 10:53.120]  of the anti gun laws i mean tony abbott is good on so many fronts but let me tell you big pharma
[10:53.120 --> 10:58.320]  will spin unlimited money to destroy you if you don't submit to them kind of like rand paul uh
[10:58.320 --> 11:02.240]  came out and got vaccinated whenever they were pointing out that he was an anti-vaxxer from
[11:02.240 --> 11:08.080]  interviews we did with him a few years ago and he's a medical doctor he came out and said there
[11:08.080 --> 11:11.600]  are a lot of negative problems a lot of side effects they won't tell you about there are some
[11:11.600 --> 11:17.040]  benefits you should really research it and check the lot of the vaccines just just good
[11:17.040 --> 11:22.480]  doctorly advice they would give prior to 10 years ago now if a doctor says don't give a pregnant
[11:22.480 --> 11:28.160]  woman a vaccine they go after their license even though the insert still says it and so they bullied
[11:28.160 --> 11:34.240]  rand paul one of the few places he really buckled into taking a shot on tv tweeting out photos of
[11:34.240 --> 11:40.080]  him taking the flu shot pretty disgusting and i really like rand paul uh i gotta say that tony
[11:40.080 --> 11:46.560]  abbott compared to what they had has actually done some good things but man it's like rick perry
[11:47.200 --> 11:52.640]  he's good on some things but lied 10 years ago former governor and said it's the law to take
[11:52.640 --> 11:58.960]  Gardasil and i went on air and i was in the local paper as well they called me and they go the
[11:58.960 --> 12:03.760]  awesome american statesman they go mr jones you claim there's no law is the governor lying and i
[12:03.760 --> 12:11.200]  said don't ask me as if as if i'm making it up go to the state law there is no law he has made it a
[12:11.200 --> 12:18.240]  recommended vaccine with an executive order through the state health department and then county health
[12:18.240 --> 12:25.120]  departments then put it on the list of school required vaccines but there's a waiver so there is
[12:25.120 --> 12:34.800]  no law he is lying to people and buffalowing them and i've got to tell you it took about two years
[12:34.800 --> 12:41.120]  and a bunch of young girls dying and japan banning it india banning it and brazil basically banning
[12:41.120 --> 12:45.120]  it saying don't take it from all the deaths and all the illnesses and all the autoimmune disorders
[12:45.120 --> 12:51.760]  but it came out that indeed there was no law and indeed Gardasil could really hurt you that's what
[12:51.760 --> 12:56.400]  he was quoted see i said i want to just give you the headlines that i just this first story i have
[12:56.400 --> 13:06.640]  to cover it first was in news.com.au Abbott rules on cancer vaccine for his daughters
[13:10.480 --> 13:16.320]  i could be seen as cruel on Gardasil he was federal health minister at the time he said that
[13:16.320 --> 13:23.120]  while he may seem as cruel callo callus heartless bastard he would not be rushing to have his own
[13:23.120 --> 13:29.200]  daughters vaccinated with hpv shot against cervical cancer and then he went on to basically
[13:29.200 --> 13:36.320]  say that he had concerns about the vaccine we'll cover that more coming up later but the point is
[13:36.320 --> 13:42.160]  he doesn't take vaccines his daughters don't take vaccines and let me give you the rest of the story
[13:42.160 --> 13:46.400]  here's der spiegel the biggest newspaper in germany most respected
[13:49.200 --> 13:55.760]  from 2009 during the swine flu hysteria second-class medicine germans unhappy with alternative
[13:55.760 --> 14:03.680]  swine flu vaccine for politicians called a clean vaccine in a secret program for top military brass
[14:03.680 --> 14:10.640]  and government officials china also has this so does england and so does the us but you go to
[14:10.640 --> 14:16.880]  medical doctors and you say i'd like to get some of the clean vaccines without the thimerosal and
[14:16.880 --> 14:21.520]  from these special lot labs here's the name of the company i want this tetanus shot for my daughters
[14:22.080 --> 14:27.520]  and the doctors go what we give is great and you don't want that i'm not going to give you the
[14:27.520 --> 14:32.960]  vaccine i've actually gone and investigated it because tetanus is a serious issue the problem
[14:32.960 --> 14:38.160]  is they know everybody takes it so that's where they've been caught in india africa the middle east
[14:38.160 --> 14:43.840]  and eastern europe and latin america adding a hormone to it that then creates an autoimmune
[14:43.840 --> 14:47.920]  response when your daughter goes into puberty and then every time she gets pregnant it causes
[14:47.920 --> 14:52.320]  a miscarriage at the beginning of the second trimester that's a declassified u. n program
[14:52.320 --> 14:57.920]  1996 they still do it and they've been caught doing it with a little bit of an augmented
[14:58.640 --> 15:03.360]  hormone that's softened a bit so it's not a hundred percent here hundred percent sterilization
[15:03.360 --> 15:08.080]  but it's partial it's a very cruel form of sterilization because you're not really sterile
[15:08.080 --> 15:14.560]  you have the the the autoimmune response and a self abort the baby and have complications
[15:14.560 --> 15:18.880]  and hey maybe women want an auto-destruct system in them then let them be honest you
[15:18.880 --> 15:24.800]  go get the shot and have all the miscarriages you want i'm being sickeningly sarcastic but this
[15:24.800 --> 15:31.920]  is going on so just to understand i can pull the articles out of china china daily i can pull
[15:31.920 --> 15:38.320]  you stuff out of the independent i can pull you more not just your spiegel they don't take the
[15:38.320 --> 15:44.240]  shots i've never talked to a globalist who takes them they go of course i don't now they've got to
[15:44.240 --> 15:48.080]  go to really dangerous countries that have got problems they have special the state department
[15:48.080 --> 15:53.920]  has a program you want to know what to take that has least amount of complications and problems
[15:53.920 --> 16:00.320]  learn the state department list of purchase orders through fed biz ops who they're going out and who
[16:00.320 --> 16:06.960]  they accept for contracts for vaccines for their higher level people their low level get the general
[16:06.960 --> 16:15.520]  vaccines again this is what's going on okay i'm going to get back into that later i just wanted
[16:15.520 --> 16:21.840]  to mention that now german chancellor ministers get special vaccine without soft kill ingredients

[18:57.600 --> 19:03.680]  baltimore mayor stephanie rawlings blake made a stunning admission saturday baltimore mayor said
[19:03.680 --> 19:08.960]  that they will allow them to basically loot and destroy after a citizen was killed by police we
[19:08.960 --> 19:14.800]  don't know the details obama is sending a representative to the funeral trying to stir all
[19:14.800 --> 19:20.960]  of it up let's go out to break with the mayor and the stunning admission we've had these types of
[19:20.960 --> 19:30.160]  conversations before and i've made it very clear that i work with the police and instructed them to
[19:30.160 --> 19:36.880]  do everything that they could to make sure that the protesters were able to exercise their right

[24:36.240 --> 24:42.240]  are asking questions right now of the military brass that's there we're shooting hd video as
[24:42.240 --> 24:46.000]  well we'll have a nightly news report with everything boiled down but there are hundreds of
[24:46.000 --> 24:52.960]  citizens there covering it and asking real questions so let's go ahead and go to a citizen
[24:53.840 --> 24:58.320]  talking to the military during citizens communication at the county commissioner's court
[24:58.320 --> 25:05.440]  in bass drop texas outside austin texas just to the east here it is operation is supposed to be nine
[25:06.880 --> 25:09.920]  and i have assurance from several other sources that it is
[25:12.240 --> 25:17.520]  as you mentioned there would only be one two humbees if imagine they're up on her 1200
[25:17.520 --> 25:29.440]  1200 pound of humbees as they move through our roads will you be able to reimburse fix any roadways
[25:31.440 --> 25:38.000]  as also mentioned any other personnel going through our town you know what this is this is
[25:38.000 --> 25:43.600]  smart citizens using bureaucracy to shut this down not oh we think you're here to acclimate us
[25:43.600 --> 25:48.800]  for martial law gun confiscation oh you're here to condition us to accept military presence which
[25:48.800 --> 25:53.840]  is the overall mission to condition the military the general public you name it no it's oh are you
[25:53.840 --> 26:00.720]  going to fix anything you break you see and the media is spinning this that we're anti-military
[26:00.720 --> 26:05.760]  then they go well then why are you against the va scandal we're all for the veterans and the
[26:05.760 --> 26:12.800]  troops themselves we're against having them be used to back up isis and al qaeda previously
[26:12.800 --> 26:18.960]  or to take our guns in katrina and to be training to fight the tea party and we have the video
[26:18.960 --> 26:26.800]  we're here saying no to the mission being ordered by the traitorous illegitimate bosses in washington
[26:26.800 --> 26:29.920]  and the military knows that that's why they're huge listeners
[26:32.160 --> 26:35.680]  and we're going to keep checking in today during this multi-hour hearing with what
[26:35.680 --> 26:40.320]  citizens are asking especially the minute joe big starts speaking let me know guys
[26:40.320 --> 26:45.120]  or jacari jackson i want to go to him but let's go here a little bit more of this live coverage
[26:45.120 --> 26:50.160]  of the beginning of jade helm the main mission to prepare us for the occupation of north com
[26:52.960 --> 26:59.600]  that's the county judge figure the timing itself basically has to do with the rotation forces as
[26:59.600 --> 27:06.240]  i said after 14 years from that we're still engaged on that heavy off tempo as it is so it
[27:06.240 --> 27:12.240]  comes to the availability of units we've had some units have to back off as global missions
[27:13.040 --> 27:17.360]  so that's right it's foreign missions now they're learning to do a domestic mission
[27:18.400 --> 27:23.360]  and again it comes to challenging terrain exposing our guys to different environments
[27:24.080 --> 27:30.080]  and we've seen that the long distances offered here in texas are exactly what we're looking for
[27:30.080 --> 27:37.200]  if you want to push our guys to the line thank you let me recognize uh we're going to more questions
[27:43.760 --> 27:48.800]  they've not been going to joe they keep saying thank you for being respectful like like acting
[27:48.800 --> 27:53.520]  like we weren't and share departments like like we inherently have to be restrained
[27:53.520 --> 28:10.000]  the good news is look at that huge room packed the people that know what's going on
[28:17.760 --> 28:20.160]  right train to work with local police it's all about
[28:20.160 --> 28:23.200]  this and it's in all the manuals i mean it's not our opinion
[28:40.320 --> 28:45.680]  so how counties will pick the texas comes down to this the land was volunteered by the private
[28:45.680 --> 28:51.760]  landowner they came to us okay they are not getting any reimbursement for volunteering
[28:51.760 --> 28:57.520]  their life they believe in training america special operations forces not only in word but also in
[28:57.520 --> 29:02.960]  need for hoods size of four dialysis and with all these bases they don't need places to train
[29:05.920 --> 29:09.440]  we're going to go to break and come back with the rest of this but remember what the
[29:09.440 --> 29:15.120]  baltimore mayor said we're going to go out to break again with that clip she said that we let the
[29:15.120 --> 29:20.560]  looters have an area to basically wreck stuff this is the attitude of government so notice
[29:21.280 --> 29:25.360]  they're hyping all the rioting while preparing for the big summer coming up to already have the
[29:25.360 --> 29:29.840]  military in place i mean this is amazing we're going to go to break and come back with that clip
[29:29.840 --> 29:34.960]  and give you the rest of the story breaking it down from every angle but we're learning a lot
[29:34.960 --> 29:40.560]  more about jade helm right now and how it ties into this this march towards tyranny and again we
[29:40.560 --> 29:46.320]  do not believe jade helm will be martial law it is just another increment as they turn the heat up
[29:46.320 --> 29:53.680]  into a total atmosphere that is martial law we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and
[29:53.680 --> 30:03.680]  the gcn radio network pre-crime technology is on the rise and the latest city to adopt this philosophy
[30:03.680 --> 30:08.800]  is miami florida the miami pd is in the process of planning and adopting hunch lab a predictive
[30:08.800 --> 30:13.280]  policing system that will be able to produce small maps of where specific crimes occur in the city
[30:13.280 --> 30:17.840]  during a particular shift miami's hunch lab system will use everything from paydays to school
[30:17.840 --> 30:22.720]  calendars weather reports and social media this is unlike the crime stat only predpole systems
[30:22.720 --> 30:28.240]  which are in use in la in atlanta and as we covered in 2013 seattle and tukoma did you know
[30:28.240 --> 30:33.520]  google and the cia have been working on political pre-crime technology since 2010 they are funding
[30:33.520 --> 30:38.320]  a company recorded future which scans tens of thousands of websites blogs and twitter accounts
[30:38.320 --> 30:43.280]  to find input of relationships between people organizations actions and incidents in fact
[30:43.280 --> 30:48.720]  in 2010 google and in cutel injected ten million dollars into recorded future eight years after
[30:48.720 --> 30:53.440]  the movie minority report was released predictive programming was already in place for us to accept
[30:53.440 --> 30:58.320]  pre-crime technology and the results it produces rob dew for info wars dot com and prison planet

[33:40.160 --> 33:45.120]  patches that is up there speaking if they did we missed it we're trying to find out right now
[33:45.120 --> 33:52.080]  before they had a civilian speak in another county out in west texas and give us a lot of juicy intel
[33:52.080 --> 33:58.720]  we have the live streams at info wars dot com and prison planet dot com from alex jones live

[34:10.560 --> 34:16.160]  what's happening but here's the goodness we understand the psi op the hundreds of citizens
[34:16.160 --> 34:23.600]  that show it up understand the psi op we know what's going on we understand this is about
[34:23.600 --> 34:28.800]  using the love that the american people have for our veterans and our military that's done a
[34:28.800 --> 34:34.800]  lot of good things in the past to then attach that to the new direction they're taking it
[34:35.440 --> 34:40.080]  where forbes and others report that the u.s military is working around the clock
[34:40.080 --> 34:44.800]  to fight their main enemy this is all over the news the tea party in fact there's the
[34:44.800 --> 34:48.640]  headline right there if you're a tv viewer how the u.s military would crush a tea party
[34:48.640 --> 34:58.240]  rebellion similar headlines in time news week associated press this is what's going on it
[34:58.240 --> 35:02.800]  doesn't mean the national guard doesn't help with forest fires or that the army doesn't help sometimes
[35:02.800 --> 35:09.200]  when a volcano goes off at mount st helens those are legitimate missions and they go out now and
[35:09.200 --> 35:14.400]  they do this you know these training exercises amongst the people like an arcadia iowa that are
[35:14.400 --> 35:19.840]  gun confiscation drills and they tell us you're not welcome at the drill in california it's for
[35:19.840 --> 35:26.320]  dirty bomb and we get there and it's basically the tea party has set off a dirty bomb and the tea
[35:26.320 --> 35:32.320]  party is being attacked by riot police yelling we're sovereigns we're sovereigns the tea party's
[35:32.320 --> 35:39.440]  not setting off dirty bombs and ied being police but they're preparing the idea and the locals so
[35:39.440 --> 35:46.480]  when the globalist have their mercenary brigades carry out the attacks on police we will be blamed
[35:46.480 --> 35:52.800]  they'll start the gun confiscation and then a real final start because we're not going to
[35:52.800 --> 35:59.840]  fema camps you can type in army advertisers for internment specialists and it goes on to how
[35:59.840 --> 36:04.160]  they'll process their social security numbers how they'll take our guns that was three years ago
[36:06.240 --> 36:12.960]  and where we get the document army dot mill remember at first we broke jade helm a month
[36:12.960 --> 36:18.080]  ago and people said there is no jade helm for a week oh now is there a jade helm oh there is a
[36:18.080 --> 36:24.320]  jade helm these are the classic psi op techniques we deal with from people like this guy up here
[36:24.320 --> 36:34.560]  oh we're here to learn how to fight overseas yeah you're here to learn how to suck eggs too
[36:35.280 --> 36:37.360]  let's go back to some more of the questions that are being asked
[36:42.640 --> 36:47.280]  we just lost audio well we'll see what happens with the use stream on that front having a lot of
[36:47.280 --> 36:55.040]  problems today but the image is hd almost call and let him know then let's keep monitoring that
[36:55.040 --> 37:00.800]  we've got enough guys to do it thank you now in fact we ought to just go to our own skype and see
[37:00.800 --> 37:06.880]  how good that is as well don't we have a skype backup usually usually what we do in the field
[37:06.880 --> 37:14.080]  parameter since i first did it with coverage in 2008 of the dnc in denver as we go live back
[37:14.080 --> 37:20.160]  then with justin tv and then a use stream and then we also have a skype and that's the field kit
[37:20.720 --> 37:25.520]  that we have that we went through hell to get to train with and everything else but
[37:26.640 --> 37:30.400]  regardless folks it's why we need you to support us so i can get larger teams
[37:30.400 --> 37:34.640]  reporter groups we've got a two-man group out there right now to cover this but the good news
[37:34.640 --> 37:38.080]  is the citizens are out there all videotaping and it's all going to go up on the different
[37:38.080 --> 37:42.240]  platforms different channels and you're going to be able to see the highlights of whatever was said
[37:42.240 --> 37:47.360]  as this whole thing unfolds from out there outside camp swift at the county seat the county government
[37:48.160 --> 37:51.120]  there in bastrop texas there in bastrop county
[37:53.120 --> 38:00.720]  so uh baltimore mayor space was provided to those who wish to destroy baltimore mayor
[38:00.720 --> 38:06.640]  stephanie rawlings blake made a stunning admission saturday and if you go to dredgerreport.com
[38:06.640 --> 38:13.440]  he understands what a big deal this is he has it red linked at the top with that quote
[38:14.240 --> 38:21.520]  baltimore mayor space was approved to those who wished to destroy let's go ahead and roll that
[38:21.520 --> 38:32.800]  clip um we also gave those who wished to destroy space to do that as well and we work very hard
[38:32.800 --> 38:40.000]  to uh to keep that balance and and to put ourselves in the best position to de-escalate
[38:40.000 --> 38:45.680]  and that's what you saw i also pointed out yesterday on the sunday broadcast that baltimore
[38:45.680 --> 38:51.760]  maryland is majority black uh it's pretty much a black run city they have uh upwards of half
[38:51.760 --> 38:58.000]  their officers are black and i'm just sick of hearing that it's white people out to kill black
[38:58.000 --> 39:02.720]  people when the statistics have been out for a decade if you're wider Hispanic you're twice as
[39:02.720 --> 39:08.720]  likely to be shot by cops and you know why i don't care if it's a black police force or a mixed
[39:08.720 --> 39:14.560]  police force what it is they don't want to respond to gangbanger inner city poor black areas
[39:16.400 --> 39:22.000]  because you get shot at you'll get sued you'll get called racist so they don't respond to as much
[39:22.000 --> 39:31.520]  crime there they slow roll just like in the riots in watts back in the 60s just like uh with the la
[39:31.520 --> 39:38.480]  riots back in the early 90s the police did not respond they let the looters beat reginald any's
[39:38.480 --> 39:45.120]  face in and the rest of it and it's almost like government is complicit even if they don't false
[39:45.120 --> 39:50.720]  flag it sometimes they have provocateurs i mean it's the media provocateur and at this time msnbc
[39:50.720 --> 39:59.120]  that they order the police in seattle with those uh black block uh white kid looters they let them
[39:59.120 --> 40:05.840]  loot and order the police to stand down i interviewed cops and the police chief later oh yes we did our
[40:05.840 --> 40:10.480]  journalism that they were basically ordered to stand down by the delta force clinton's people
[40:10.480 --> 40:18.480]  were there oh delta force the same ones running the psi op jade helm and don't look at the uniforms
[40:18.480 --> 40:23.600]  of these officers now in special forces and think oh they must be patriots i have no doubt they're not
[40:23.600 --> 40:29.760]  proficient intelligent men but they now have survived all the obama purges and have shown
[40:29.760 --> 40:35.920]  they're ready to follow orders so in my experience now when you get up to colonel level and above
[40:35.920 --> 40:39.760]  full colonel level you're dealing with some folks that are willing to take orders all the way
[40:39.760 --> 40:44.160]  people like lieutenant colonel schaefer got basically run out he's now still involved with
[40:44.160 --> 40:50.240]  the pentagon in secretive things uh with his anti-binladen unit because he blew the whistle
[40:50.240 --> 40:56.160]  there was a stand down they go after real people pat tilman wouldn't play games so they killed him
[40:58.800 --> 41:04.240]  so baltimore mayor and again we'll show you drudge report dot com on screen with the big red headline
[41:05.680 --> 41:08.560]  space was provided to those that wish to destroy
[41:08.560 --> 41:15.440]  it baltimore police beat journalists during protest quote he's a photographer he's press
[41:16.160 --> 41:18.000]  get him that's ap
[41:20.800 --> 41:27.840]  read the article baltimore police beat journalists during protest so they let the black run police
[41:27.840 --> 41:31.920]  department can't blame white people here and again i'm not blaming blacks or whites so you
[41:31.920 --> 41:39.920]  governments just act the same generally but the point is ordered the press attacked and ordered
[41:41.040 --> 41:47.600]  the stand down and now the white house is there running the show just like the quote white run
[41:47.600 --> 41:56.080]  police department in missouri in ferguson ordered jacari jackson and joe begs and vice magazine and
[41:56.080 --> 42:05.920]  others attacked attacked and maybe we should show the video the journal is being beaten by the police
[42:05.920 --> 42:10.640]  so targeting people that have done nothing now do i blame the average cop no i don't
[42:12.320 --> 42:18.560]  do i blame the cops that follow the orders to beat somebody yes but the point is you try being
[42:18.560 --> 42:22.880]  there when the protesters are attacking you and the police are and why is that because at the end
[42:22.880 --> 42:29.120]  of the day they're all working for the globalist who want social decay and social unrest and social
[42:29.120 --> 42:35.200]  collapse unbelievable as a journalist to see the amount of persecution of media
[42:36.400 --> 42:41.120]  and to see the horror media not even willing to stand up for its own people though the ap
[42:41.120 --> 42:44.960]  didn't at least admit that the police did this and it was wrong ap came out three weeks ago and
[42:44.960 --> 42:50.160]  said the president of ap and said the media is controlled we're told what to say we're being
[42:50.160 --> 42:56.960]  given no access yes that's what's going on and there are political prisoners rotting in jails
[42:56.960 --> 43:04.000]  everywhere all over the united states for simply reporting on government crimes tyranny is here
[43:04.000 --> 43:09.680]  we're all in grave danger the answer isn't groveling the answer is standing up and getting involved
[43:09.680 --> 43:16.560]  like folks are doing in bass drop do we get the audio feedback good let's go to see what's happening
[43:16.560 --> 43:20.480]  now in bass drop texas of your tv viewer radio listeners can get the audio here it is
[43:23.840 --> 43:28.160]  and i'll just ask this way it's written when we have a federal government that cannot tell the
[43:28.160 --> 43:34.640]  truth how do we know that what you're saying is true
[43:38.720 --> 43:44.720]  there's everybody not to mix apples and pumpkins okay let's do it that way this
[43:44.720 --> 43:50.480]  institution right here has been around for 240 years i have transitioned in this uniform
[43:50.480 --> 43:56.480]  various shades of it under five presidents all that peacefully you may have issues with the
[43:56.480 --> 44:02.240]  federal government you may have issues with the administration so be it okay but this
[44:02.240 --> 44:09.280]  institution right here has been with you for over 240 years see they're going to use the uniform
[44:09.280 --> 44:14.320]  to sell the tyranny it's high level scythe i said that 20 minutes ago you just saw it bam
[44:14.320 --> 44:18.880]  oh the enemy script wow that's evil
[44:18.880 --> 44:34.320]  say hello you say that the fb i and um dhs is involved not the hs no um yes dhs is some
[44:34.320 --> 44:40.720]  of the damn document he was going to be involved no he may as too you liar thank you thank you
[44:40.720 --> 44:48.960]  god that's a liar by the way they say george washington isn't welcome in today's military
[44:48.960 --> 44:57.440]  but he you just use george washington see they're playing games oh you're wrong oh no you don't
[44:57.440 --> 45:03.280]  get your question they're just they're just stopping the whole group the question is have any of you
[45:03.280 --> 45:10.560]  been paid money by the army go bixie's asked that texting like in 99 in san antonio have they
[45:10.560 --> 45:21.760]  paid any money individually to the campaigns let's go back to it see the county judge is trying to
[45:21.760 --> 45:43.600]  manage his enemy his prey audio just one way down guys can you boost it
[45:43.600 --> 45:52.320]  military personnel will be in the county and private citizens on the street or in a restaurant or
[45:52.320 --> 45:55.600]  or exercise purposes wrong or no or it doesn't matter if you don't even choose for a nice little
[45:55.600 --> 46:01.600]  coat yes the kids are going to want that can't go today they may want to have tomorrow's rules
[46:01.600 --> 46:06.000]  they may want that can't go all right good that's right let me start here
[46:06.000 --> 46:12.720]  under our panel and see the creek for all the favorite book with me is a rich dictionary
[46:13.440 --> 46:21.360]  and my question is i want you to address receding this and cutting it out and not bring it back by
[46:21.360 --> 46:29.520]  any other name that your strategies may find in this dictionary that has anything to say that it is
[46:29.520 --> 46:35.280]  a preparation for martial law that's because it is not preparation for martial law sir that's what
[46:35.280 --> 46:41.200]  you say wow that's a lie we have footage around the country they're currently training for civil
[46:41.200 --> 46:54.560]  unrest we're gonna have hd video all this and audio the crew here is doing a great job the crew
[46:54.560 --> 46:58.000]  out there is doing a great job i'm kind of shopping at the bed i wish i kind of would have gone but
[46:58.000 --> 47:04.160]  i've got a traffic cop everything here this is just unprecedented to hear the lies coming out of their
[47:04.160 --> 47:11.120]  mouth in no shape or form is this preparation for martial law because they're not going to call it
[47:11.120 --> 47:17.920]  martial law they can get up there and say there are no fema camps because they're not called
[47:17.920 --> 47:23.600]  fema camps they're called the emergency centers establishment act they're called preparation
[47:23.600 --> 47:31.040]  for continuity of government they're called the civilian inmate labor camp program they're called
[47:31.040 --> 47:39.200]  emergency resettlement centers in fact we'll put that on screen or i'll pull it up just for folks
[47:39.760 --> 47:46.960]  army hiring resettlement experts army preparing resettlement operations in us and then he gets
[47:46.960 --> 47:51.840]  up there and says there's no preparations for martial law when it's in hundreds of newspapers
[47:51.840 --> 47:55.600]  that the military is training to quote take on gun owners and veterans i mean that's a bit of the
[47:55.600 --> 48:02.960]  news hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times there it is careers and jobs
[48:02.960 --> 48:08.320]  internment specialists and they've got them for overseas and domestically let's go ahead and go
[48:08.320 --> 48:14.960]  back to the feed and see we get some good audio how do you respond to that sir one there's not a
[48:14.960 --> 48:22.080]  style campaign going on associated with that this is an information brief and that has nothing to do
[48:22.080 --> 48:28.960]  with the crime of citizens uh in the valley so i wish you'd clarify the question because it sounded
[48:28.960 --> 48:36.800]  more like a statement in the end the question is is psychological um the psychological operations
[48:36.800 --> 48:43.840]  is it considered psychological warfare do you do is it is it considered weaponry in your army
[48:43.840 --> 48:50.560]  trainer at least it says operation is a line of operation they're a correctional line of effort
[48:50.560 --> 48:55.680]  at that point i'm not an operation it's just the way the effects are passed differently
[48:56.400 --> 49:05.040]  so they're just feeding a bunch of bullet folks i i just searched army resettlement info wars.com
[49:05.040 --> 49:10.640]  on google leak us army document outlines plan for resettlement army manual outlines plan to kill
[49:10.640 --> 49:15.920]  rioters i mean this is all from army manuals you go there you link through to army.mil army admits
[49:15.920 --> 49:23.600]  reeducation camp manual i mean that's just bombshell video become a fema camp internment resettlement
[49:23.600 --> 49:32.640]  officer i mean all of this is their own sources look army admits reeducation camp manual not
[49:32.640 --> 49:39.440]  intended for public release they got so upset with us back at the time and it lists the social
[49:39.440 --> 49:44.880]  security numbers how to process this all of this and they just think that we're going to sit there
[49:45.840 --> 49:55.680]  and go along with all of this like we're stupid there there it is army.mil fm3-39.40
[49:59.200 --> 50:02.640]  but again he just sits up there like we're stupid like we don't know what's going on

[01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:55.280]  the county commissioners outside austin and bass drop county look scared uh they're up there uh not
[01:00:55.280 --> 01:01:00.080]  being as condescending now fumbling around the serious questions that are being asked
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:08.800]  joe bigs got his question in during a break so we'll have that tonight on the nightly news
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:14.800]  he basically said have you given money like delta force was caught doing in 99 in san antonio
[01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:20.480]  to local officials and they reportedly said no because they just give them bags of cash sometimes
[01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:26.240]  200 grand a piece if you don't believe me it was in the associated press look it up this is an
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:35.680]  infiltration operation and even the captains and majors aren't given the half of what's going on
[01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:40.480]  we have professor john lot joining us the famous professor that first did the actuary showing that
[01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:46.560]  more guns means less crime now in fact well let's get our graphics from the nightly news ready that
[01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:51.280]  from last year when those numbers came out that show the 51 52 drop in violent crime in areas
[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:55.200]  with guns well it's nationwide overall it's like something like 80 percent of the areas with the
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:02:02.000]  guns actually but overall it makes it go down 51 percent and guns being used in crimes and that's
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:08.240]  why they've got to let people loot and riot in baltimore as the mayor said so that they can then
[01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:14.800]  have an excuse for a police day it's real simple and it was the same delta force folks
[01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:21.280]  following orders from here clinton who ran the dirty trick on the wto protesters in 99 and
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:26.480]  brought in a group of 50 scum from the local university commie trained ford foundation funded
[01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:34.320]  soros group to knock out windows and burn stuff and then they blamed the peaceful crowd
[01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:38.480]  or to stand down for a day till the public said do something
[01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:46.560]  and they then attacked the peaceful crowds that's how you do a false flag
[01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:52.880]  let's go back to some of the feeds see if we can get some of the audio because it's up and down
[01:02:53.520 --> 01:03:00.720]  from bass drop so robin's safe is our gas and training event okay we will talk about robin's
[01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:08.960]  safe yes and it was a it was a soon-to-be green beret was chopped killed by a sheriff's deputy
[01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:14.560]  who the sheriff's deputy did not know that the exercise was taking place robin's safe is a
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:20.720]  program of record that has been in place for over 50 years in uh the central he wanted to
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:24.240]  work with the county against the county support general and it's legitimate training that's been
[01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:30.800]  turned illegitimate now you've had people killed the notification went out that it's not passed down
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:34.800]  to every person that it should have made its way to the point is these drills are dangerous
[01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:41.040]  they tried to disarm the police officer it was part of the exercise they killed him
[01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:47.520]  the deputy sheriff had no idea what was going on and uh deputy sheriff shot killed a soon-to-be
[01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:54.000]  green beret additional control measures were put in place but again the r&p process is also in place
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:59.440]  for 25 years well how many green berets that we had on his guest and marine corps kernels we've had
[01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:04.160]  on his guests that are telling you this is for martial law so he sits up there and the only
[01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:11.280]  reason he sits there is because he's willing to shovel huge manure buckets on the american people
[01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:16.400]  but listen here's the good news we're here out ahead of this so you'll never get away with
[01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:20.960]  martial law so when you try it down the road everyone would have already been educated about
[01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:26.320]  it we're not going to get hit flat-footed this is about a fighting stance we know what's going on
[01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:30.560]  we're ready and we're in the info war we're not laying around till the false flag gets pulled
[01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:36.240]  you come out for the guns we're peacefully working to take our county cities and states back and

[01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:50.000]  mission and to support them in constitutional domestic operations as well and to support
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:54.960]  them once they got out of the military something the establishment doesn't do the very army up

[01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:24.480]  it's thoughts on non-violent offenders riding away in prisons they say that in these current times
[01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:31.040]  we are more quote civilized but are we really more free when the persian army demanded king
[01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:37.120]  leonidas and his Spartans surrender their arms the outnumbered king shouted molon lave or come
[01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:42.800]  and take them even though leonidas was eventually defeated by a much larger adversary he is not

[01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:20.960]  coming up at the bottom of the hour
[01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:28.880]  or humanity won't survive other thousand years unless it escapes earth physicists even hawking
[01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:34.160]  warrants and that ties into headlines like this two thousand times normal radiation found in
[01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:40.240]  tokyo playground officials deny any link to fukushima that ties into the ukrainian nightmare
[01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:47.040]  of chair noble that happened 29 years ago today we're going to be looking at all of that coming
[01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:53.520]  up plus the increased earthquakes and what scientists are saying is happening the earth's
[01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:59.920]  crust and the great ring of fire what are the volcanologists what are the seismologists saying
[01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:06.800]  it's extremely well quite frankly uh frightening there's some good news chipotle to stop serving
[01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:12.640]  genetically altered food that shows the power of consumers taking action and we've got new intel on
[01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:17.360]  the batman killer turns out he was working for darpa and secret brain disorder programs that's
[01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:24.400]  out of the associated press can't make up that stuff it's so weird uh we're going to get into
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:30.160]  more on jade helm and our reporters on the ground uh with that training that's going on the reason
[01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:34.800]  there's the concerns is the army itself says they're being trained their main mission to fight as
[01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:39.200]  gun owners conservatives libertarians so that's what people are concerned we'll look at every
[01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:44.640]  angle of that also hillary has not done one press conference or talked to any press breaking a record
[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:51.280]  that's coming up but joining us until the bottom of the hour is one of the most important people
[01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:56.800]  when it comes to defending the second amendment from a place of science 20 plus years ago when he
[01:09:56.800 --> 01:10:04.560]  began to first put out his research uh you know top statistician from you name it uh Yale university
[01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:09.120]  university of chicago the list goes on and on i won't go through all his phd's and the rest of it
[01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:16.800]  here he's an economist you name it he's also a fox news columnist and analyst he's got a phd from
[01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:24.400]  ucla he's written over a hundred peer reviewed academic journals he's written um dumbing down
[01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:30.240]  the courts how politics keep the smartest judges off the bench his website is amazing crime research
[01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:36.720]  dot or g and they have the crime prevention research center he got attacked when he wrote
[01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:42.560]  his best-selling book back in the 90s with all of his published studies on more guns means less
[01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:49.520]  crime such an important book to have today but now even more numbers are in 51 drop in violent
[01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:57.840]  crime from 92 to 2012 they don't have new numbers yet 51 but the la times reported last year gun
[01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:04.320]  crime goes down but public believes that there's more crime we'll put that headline uh on screen
[01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:10.480]  for folks here in a moment but then you tune in to mainstream tv and they go there's an epidemic
[01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:16.160]  of violence have an epidemic of school shootings it's worse than ever gun crime is plunged but
[01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:23.120]  americans think it's up study says la times so i'm not defending police brutality militarization
[01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:28.720]  there's certainly some bad cops they get defended by bad departments it's wrong but police violence
[01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:37.040]  overalls flat but there's a perception that it's up as well so is this a victory of delusion over
[01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:44.320]  facts because we we've had a lot of success with the second amendment we've turned the tide to a
[01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:51.680]  great extent but still still the anti gunners put out their lives so are we winning or are we losing
[01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:56.800]  if this was a football game and we just ended halftime where are we professor john r lot
[01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:04.400]  well thanks for having me on well i mean i i think it's divided if you look at uh a lot of
[01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:08.880]  states things have been getting better in terms of allowing individuals to defend themselves
[01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:16.560]  if you look uh federally um you know you have a lot of judges being put on the bench right now
[01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:22.640]  who are not very sympathetic to individuals having the ability to go and defend themselves uh and
[01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:28.480]  obviously president obama has been trying to do many things recently trying to ban one of the most
[01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:34.960]  popular type of bullets for uh what's the most popular type of rifle in the united states but
[01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:42.960]  i think on net things have generally been improving my big concern is that you have people like uh
[01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:50.880]  michael bloomberg george soros uh prism obama many large foundations are putting a huge amount of
[01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:58.240]  money i mean literally hundreds of millions of dollars trying to put out studies uh to go and
[01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:04.800]  claim bad things about guns on net and that's one reason why we set up the crime prevention
[01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:08.880]  research center uh you know we're not going to have hundreds of millions of dollars but i think
[01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:14.400]  even with hundreds of thousands of dollars we can make a difference in terms of that debate so
[01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:22.640]  we put together if people go to our website they can see uh uh the list of academics that we have
[01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:27.840]  associated with them we have people from harvard university chicago the worton business school
[01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:35.040]  other places uh who are experts in these areas and can quickly respond to claims that are put out
[01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:41.120]  by bloomberg and others i remember just three weeks ago it came out in the associated press
[01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:48.000]  that despite the fact that it showed a 51 drop in violent crime the fbi had been pressured on that
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:54.000]  report uh to try to play up school shootings and actually doctored the numbers so that's why school
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:59.520]  shootings were flat instead of actually down and obviously most of them were gangbangers shooting
[01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:07.040]  each other so this shows some real deception going on here right well yeah i wasn't on school
[01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:14.640]  shootings per se what it was is they had released a report uh just before the november election last
[01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:20.560]  year claiming so-called mass and active shooters cases had increased dramatically
[01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:28.880]  yes 2000 from 2000 to 2013 they were claiming that there was a 16.5 annual increase in the
[01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:35.520]  rate of these attacks and it's simply false i mean uh they did several things with regard to
[01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:41.600]  the data there one thing was they actually missed a number of cases of mass shootings but the cases
[01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:46.320]  that they missed were almost all at the beginning of the period so it made it look like the beginning
[01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:52.480]  of the period was safer than it actually was and then they included these so-called active
[01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:59.200]  shooter cases which include cases where somebody fires a gun in public but nobody gets shot and
[01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:06.080]  the thing is the way they incorporated that data it's just no data set for that police don't collect
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:12.080]  that type of data like they do murders or rapes or robberies uh what they did was they did google
[01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:19.120]  news searches on them the problem is sure if i were to do a google news search on let's say a mass
[01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:24.640]  shooting that occurred a week ago let's say i get 800 stories if i do it five years from now that
[01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:32.240]  same event i may get 500 if i do it 10 years from now i may get 300 archives aren't kept up
[01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:38.480]  news organizations go out of business they just don't pay for having the hard disk space in order
[01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:44.720]  sure it's total absolute quackery kind of like the justice department's new report saying veterans
[01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:49.440]  and gun owners the number one terror threat and when the fbi was questioned about it they said oh we
[01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:55.840]  got our internet our information from the internet i mean they just can go and randomly make up whatever
[01:15:55.840 --> 01:16:03.360]  they want how do they deal with the fbi's crime statistics then that show according to uh fox
[01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:07.200]  news breakdown you can correct me if i'm wrong or even the justice department's own breakdown
[01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:17.520]  a 51 drop in guns being used in crimes since 1992 is that accurate it's been it's been more than
[01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:25.120]  actually the peak in murders uh was in and other violent crimes was in 91 but you've actually seen
[01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:32.560]  i don't know maybe a 60 to more drop in gun crimes and similar with murders so we weren't exaggerating
[01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:37.840]  professor we were actually we were actually not giving people the it's it's it's better than i said
[01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:44.800]  right somewhat better but i mean those are two different issues gun crimes generally and those
[01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:50.480]  that are used in mass shootings i mean there's mass shootings deaths from mass shootings have
[01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:57.040]  been relatively constant you've actually had a drop if people go to our website at crimeresearch.org
[01:16:57.040 --> 01:17:02.240]  we actually go through and look at over the last couple decades deaths from school shootings
[01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:07.840]  and that's been declining over time uh right now the rate of deaths and school shootings is about
[01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:14.880]  half what it was uh in the early 90s sure but didn't you ask the public i think there's an
[01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:20.400]  epidemic so what do we do about this brainwashing as the attorney general called it that what do
[01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:28.240]  we do about this brainwashing professor well uh what you do is you know people try to inform
[01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:34.800]  themselves we have places like crime prevention research center where hopefully within a new
[01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:42.000]  cycle when uh bloomberg or others or the obama administration comes out with reports we have
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:48.080]  people working with us who know where the data actually is and we can go and uh and put out
[01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:55.040]  kind of correct information it's hard to get that out you know in the fbi report uh fox was the only
[01:17:55.040 --> 01:18:00.000]  one that was interested in running a story on it even though when the original report came out it
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:06.320]  was front page stories in the new york times the wall street journal u.s.a. today uh led on all the
[01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:12.640]  major news broadcast uh but it was simply false i mean it fit into the narrative that the obama
[01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:19.040]  administration wanted to push at the time and to try to gin up some support for gun control before
[01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:25.120]  the uh election last november absolutely but they got caught with climate gate with the actual
[01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:30.240]  emails saying let's hide the decline new memos have come out where they fudge the numbers on that
[01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:36.480]  as well or would put thermometers out on black tarmacs to raise the temperature uh has there
[01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:41.120]  always been this type of institutional and academic fraud professor uh and we're just
[01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:47.680]  learning about it now or is it getting worse well i take over time i've been reading fbi reports
[01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:55.920]  for 30 years the fbi has kept a chinese wall between kind of political influences and the raw
[01:18:55.920 --> 01:19:02.000]  data uh the report that was released uh before the election last november is the first time and
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:09.040]  the only time that i've really seen uh fbi number is actually corrupted in that way and it's something
[01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:16.640]  that concerns me i hope it's not a trend uh that goes on i mean surely data has been used uh for
[01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:22.480]  political purposes but there's always been a distinction between how data is used and the
[01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:29.440]  actual raw data i mean other academics around the country will use um will use that raw data
[01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:35.440]  for studies and if the raw data is corrupted it's going to make it so that all those studies that
[01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:41.280]  use that data are going to be pretty useless sure well we actually have gone out on a number of
[01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:48.400]  occasions and and and hired doctorate statisticians to look at the numbers and and you know one can
[01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:55.120]  come up with 51 percent you can come up with 60 uh bottom line more guns does equal uh less crime
[01:19:55.760 --> 01:19:59.440]  and if you go to crimeresearch.org you can see some of the most prestigious research
[01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:04.160]  which needs to get out to people because we have the facts they have the lies everybody knows
[01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:08.800]  you know a city like austin with all the guns has a lower crime rate than new york with no
[01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:15.200]  guns or chicago i mean it's really a no-brainer uh but nobel laureate milton freedman called john
[01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:21.920]  lot said john lot quote has few equals as a prospective analysis and controversial public
[01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:27.520]  policy issues he's been one of the most productive inside of economists in the world he's ranked 26
[01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:33.760]  worldwide in terms of quality adjusted total academic journal output fourth in terms of total
[01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:39.200]  research output and 86 in terms of citations that's worldwide out of tens of thousands
[01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:45.360]  among economics business and law professors his research is currently the 25th most downloaded
[01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:50.560]  in the world he's also a frequent writer of op eds and i'm not trying to sit here and you know
[01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:57.120]  grovel at the feet of the professor but he really is a top academic that that that big corporations
[01:20:57.120 --> 01:21:04.080]  governments militaries come to to get real numbers folks not the publicized obama garbage
[01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:09.280]  where they get i mean has it what's breaking the back let me ask you this getting out of statistics
[01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:13.680]  professor what is breaking the back because i mean i think we're starting to break it we're
[01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:17.200]  starting to win which really makes me fear for what they're going to pull next what hype they're
[01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:23.600]  going to go with how will they strike back a the anti gunners obviously executive orders but more i
[01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:30.000]  want to know and then b looking at this just as a you know layperson not as a professor
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:37.680]  why are they so anti-gun what's driving them all right well there are a lot a lot of questions
[01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:43.520]  that you're raising there let me just point out first if you look at polls whether bpu or gallup
[01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:51.600]  or cnn over time there's been increasing opposition to gun control the latest polls show that on net
[01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:56.640]  you have significantly more people opposing gun control than supported and that that if you look
[01:21:56.640 --> 01:22:05.840]  at puze surveys for example that change basically started around 1999 2000 and uh it's gradually
[01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:12.480]  been getting more opposition right now uh people oppose more gun control by about a 52 to 46 percent
[01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:17.760]  margin if you go and you look at the surveys that kind of break this down a little bit further what
[01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:24.000]  you find i think is that the number one reason people are opposing more gun controls that they
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:30.800]  change their views on the benefits of guns if gallup in 2000 when they ask people whether guns
[01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:37.520]  make in the homemade people safer or as riskier only 35 percent of americans said that having a gun
[01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:45.440]  in the home made them safer at the end of last year it was up to 63 percent that change is huge
[01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:52.000]  is that not an inversion i mean that's a flipping isn't it right it's a flipping but they basically
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:57.120]  it corresponds very closely with the other polls i was mentioning in terms of increased opposition
[01:22:57.120 --> 01:23:04.160]  to gun control and i think just as we can see that the reason for the change bloomberg and other
[01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:10.720]  organizations see that also and so with their spending and you're going to see over the next
[01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:17.920]  year and a half or so has been an right so you're showing the pew survey there and you can see uh
[01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:26.720]  support for gun ownership was falling during the 90s and it hit the bottom the end of the 90s
[01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:33.280]  2000 and this gradually been increasing since then but they see that also and so what you're
[01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:38.960]  going to see over the next year and a half is really an explosion of research being financed by
[01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:47.360]  bloomberg by the obama administration by others uh by large foundations uh you know just in the
[01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:54.320]  beginning of 2013 president obama met with the head of 23 large health care foundations who
[01:23:54.320 --> 01:24:02.960]  have been working with him on on pushing obama care and what happened was is that um he said look
[01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:08.000]  we've won that debate it's time for us to focus on another issue and what he convinced them to do
[01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:13.760]  was to focus on gun control so you have these large foundations that may be spending tens of
[01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:20.080]  millions of dollars each now focusing on guns and they've been doing that for a couple years and
[01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:27.680]  you're going to start to see pretty much a tidal wave of uh research and it's going to get huge news
[01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:32.720]  coverage uh when it comes out over the next year and a half and i think that's how they think they're
[01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:39.840]  going to change the debate and so the question is who's going to be able to go and do research in
[01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:45.840]  order to try to offset that to try to sure respond to all those claims well that's your answer and
[01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:49.920]  that's exactly what i think is a layperson and i can see the graphs i can talk to the public i see
[01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:59.760]  what's happening abortion in 1973 was basically 60 four uh 35 percent or so uh against maybe five
[01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:03.920]  percent didn't know now the numbers have flipped as you said you can look at different polls they're
[01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:09.680]  all pretty much the same same thing with guns it's completely flipping and i see after new town and
[01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:16.400]  other events that accelerating the implosion of the gun control myth that it makes us safe
[01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:23.920]  is there a danger for bloomberg and soros and these other uh operatives is there a danger for them
[01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:33.840]  professor uh if their past propaganda uh pitches backfired then is there a chance and i personally
[01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:39.680]  think this will cause an even bigger backlash well i don't know i mean uh they're doing it
[01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:46.640]  differently they're basically funding academics that agree with them uh giving them lots of
[01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:54.400]  resources to produce research and so i'm not sure i think it will have some impact on the debate i mean
[01:25:54.400 --> 01:26:00.400]  if you have academics constantly coming out and saying that guns are bad i mean i think they're
[01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:06.880]  not representative the research that's out there and that it's misleading but you have to understand
[01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:12.800]  the problems with the research and most people in the media don't have the background or the
[01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:19.360]  knowledge to go and uh go and dissect those claims they're going to be made and that's
[01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:26.320]  that's the reason why we set up crimeresearch.org well here's why i know just as a man and as a
[01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:31.760]  media person why they're going to lose in the end and that's because people have lost confident in
[01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:35.760]  the central government to protect them they've lost confidence in most local governments to
[01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:39.920]  protect them it's not the local government's job to protect you and people now are understanding
[01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:45.760]  they need to get prepared and be the captain of their own ship and i think it's for that reason
[01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:51.760]  the major libertarian swing that even the financial times of london reported on worldwide
[01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:57.280]  uh i mean we're seeing gun control reversals in other countries now i think this is the
[01:26:57.280 --> 01:27:01.840]  beginning of a libertarian renaissance but as you said the empire is going to strike back
[01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:05.360]  with quack science but i think we've got a good chance of really winning professor
[01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:12.560]  well it's it's going to be interesting debate uh you know all we can do is just try to get
[01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:18.640]  accurate information out there uh you know there's to accurately measure both the costs and benefits
[01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:25.040]  of people being alone guns i mean there's been some changes for the better i'll just mention a
[01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:31.840]  couple things one is due back to 2007 there about 4.6 million concealed carry permit holders now
[01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:41.040]  there's over 12 may uh and you've begun to see that uh people who i think benefit the most from
[01:27:41.040 --> 01:27:46.960]  owning guns basically two groups women uh and the elderly who are well to relatively weaker
[01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:51.200]  physically and the presence of gun represents a much bigger change in their ability to defend
[01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:56.720]  themselves as well as poor blacks who live in high crime urban areas that people are most likely
[01:27:56.720 --> 01:28:02.400]  be victims of violent crime you've been seeing changes in their attitudes towards guns that increase
[01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:07.920]  gun ownership and increased concealed carry that's right among those individuals can you talk about
[01:28:07.920 --> 01:28:13.120]  that because that's really interesting i've seen the statistics out of chicago just just a handful
[01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:17.920]  of concealed carry by black americans in those bad neighborhoods has started to bring down the crime
[01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:23.040]  a little bit i mean talk about antibiotics uh you know dealing with these thugs uh you having
[01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:29.680]  good americans with guns is the answer right but police are extremely important my research indicates
[01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:34.720]  to me that police are the single most important factor for reducing crime i there's no doubt about
[01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:40.800]  that in my mind but i think the police themselves understand if you look at surveys of police that
[01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:44.800]  even though they are extremely important they recognize that they virtually always arrive on
[01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:49.920]  the crime scene after the crimes occurred and that raises the question what should people be able to do
[01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:56.720]  when they're confirmed by themselves and depending on themselves as you say uh it turns out to be the
[01:28:56.720 --> 01:29:02.000]  safest course of action when the police can't be there to protect them as i said it's particularly
[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:07.520]  true for people who are most likely victims of violent crime the problem is is that in a place
[01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:13.680]  like illinois to go through the concealed carry permit process is like six hundred dollars to go
[01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:20.240]  through the training and pay the fees in neighboring indiana it's forty five dollars for the total
[01:29:20.240 --> 01:29:25.520]  cost in a state like pennsylvania it's twenty dollars amazing well you are a true general in
[01:29:25.520 --> 01:29:30.880]  the front lines of of human liberty and the right to self-defense a modern day founding father of

[01:29:36.240 --> 01:29:40.960]  and what he just warned us of the next big fights coming the next waves coming in thank you professor
[01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:45.760]  thank you very much we'll be back with more news straight ahead on all the shows
[01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:55.520]  we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:06.080]  let's talk about the real war on women first wave feminism was a noble cause but modern
[01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:12.240]  feminists well instead of fighting for say paid and protected maternity leave they want to ban
[01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:20.320]  words shirts and man spreading come on that's cultural marxism which asserts that culture and
[01:30:20.320 --> 01:30:26.960]  language is responsible for oppressing women and not the state the truth is the state encourages
[01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:32.400]  gender wars it's a divide and conquer tactic designed to keep us fighting amongst ourselves
[01:30:32.400 --> 01:30:37.840]  in fact the feminist movement was hijacked by the political class to exploit women as the late
[01:30:37.840 --> 01:30:43.600]  erin russo revealed the rockefellers bankrolled feminism and not because they had any interests
[01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:48.800]  in women's rights but because women in the workforce was the ultimate trifecta the state
[01:30:48.800 --> 01:30:54.240]  collects more tax dollars children are indoctrinated at an earlier age and the traditional family
[01:30:54.240 --> 01:31:02.000]  structure destroyed leon macadam reporting for info wars dot com hi i'm alex jones when i got on air
[01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:08.720]  20 years ago i weighed 180 pounds i lift weights five days a week i could swim two three miles
[01:31:08.720 --> 01:31:13.760]  then i discovered the new world order the globalist their agenda i started an access television show
[01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:19.680]  i was so dedicated to my work and hanging around with radio guys that i began drinking i began
[01:31:19.680 --> 01:31:26.400]  smoking cigars and then even cigarettes i transformed from looking like a white bruce lee

[01:48:33.840 --> 01:48:38.800]  in those regions who are getting a skewed version of reality and it's not something that the state
[01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:43.760]  department can do on its own by any means following up on our conversation i'd love
[01:48:43.760 --> 01:48:48.960]  to convene a group of media executives who can help us think about better ways to respond to

[01:50:21.920 --> 01:50:28.160]  organizations like the la times to survive the tentacles of the obama administration are quietly

[01:50:35.040 --> 01:50:41.520]  reminds me of the attorney general saying at a media meeting we need to brainwash the public
[01:50:41.520 --> 01:50:46.720]  into not liking guns and that's what the military is doing here is getting us ready for them to be
[01:50:46.720 --> 01:50:51.600]  on the streets in fact hear it from holder here it is and what we need to do is change the way
[01:50:51.600 --> 01:50:55.920]  in which people think about guns especially young people one thing that i think is clear with
[01:50:55.920 --> 01:51:00.160]  young people and with adults as well is that we just have to be repetitive we're gonna be back
[01:51:00.160 --> 01:51:05.040]  as china freely allows the sale of bulletproof armor plates while our u.s politicians argue from

[01:54:06.880 --> 01:54:12.960]  on brainwashing with the media and what we need to do is change the way in which people think
[01:54:12.960 --> 01:54:17.520]  about guns especially young people one thing that i think is clear with young people and with adults
[01:54:17.520 --> 01:54:22.000]  as well is that we just have to be repetitive about this it's not enough to simply have a
[01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:27.440]  catchy ad on a monday and then only do it every monday we need to do this every day of the week
[01:54:27.440 --> 01:54:33.040]  and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way and so when
[01:54:33.040 --> 01:54:40.880]  you see actors or movies or anything they're being paid to say don't be racist give me your guns
[01:54:40.880 --> 01:54:45.680]  don't be racist support obama care or don't be homophobic let us teach your three-year-old
[01:54:45.680 --> 01:54:52.080]  how to have oral sex and that was in the news sunday in schools
[01:54:54.640 --> 01:54:58.000]  or let's have open borders you're a racist i mean we're being conquered
[01:54:59.520 --> 01:55:05.120]  and the agenda is let us run your medical care let us tell you how to be obsessed with this type
[01:55:05.120 --> 01:55:09.200]  of sex and we're going to put military on the streets and we're going to take more of your money
[01:55:09.200 --> 01:55:15.440]  and folks they don't want us having kids they want to break up the family unit
[01:55:16.240 --> 01:55:21.520]  i'm not against people that are out with their sexual preferences or whatever i'm a libertarian
[01:55:21.520 --> 01:55:26.480]  a lot of those lifestyles are destructive but who am i to judge people i'm i'm i mean come on
[01:55:27.040 --> 01:55:32.720]  i'm not going to throw rocks and glass houses i've been a wild man in my life but to sit there
[01:55:32.720 --> 01:55:40.080]  and and just make that the issue while the whole world goes on around us is crazy
[01:55:41.360 --> 01:55:47.840]  now we have joe jennings who does a great job directing some of the tv nightly news
[01:55:48.400 --> 01:55:57.280]  he also does analysis for us joe jennings long time journalist from tv news is in there he's
[01:55:57.280 --> 01:56:01.600]  been listening for the last five hours even before we were live and when watching the
[01:56:01.600 --> 01:56:05.760]  use stream feed of jacari jackson and joe bigs they're in bass drop texas where they're having
[01:56:05.760 --> 01:56:11.120]  the jade helm brainwashing session and the message is hey a thousand people because that's
[01:56:11.120 --> 01:56:16.160]  now the number we're getting just room after room auditoriums full down the road just you know
[01:56:17.120 --> 01:56:20.720]  you name it they're saying we don't want martial law we don't want our guns taken
[01:56:20.720 --> 01:56:24.800]  they go we won't we go what about katrina what about your manual it was folks are
[01:56:24.800 --> 01:56:29.600]  confronting them about all the news saying their enemies the vets and stuff and joe jennings has been
[01:56:29.600 --> 01:56:36.560]  listening to this and he said that this kernel is super arrogant but some interesting giblets of news
[01:56:36.560 --> 01:56:42.960]  have come out so joe jennings tell us what you've learned in there in the control room watching
[01:56:42.960 --> 01:56:50.160]  our reporters in the field hey alex what it seems to be is that they're saying this is
[01:56:50.160 --> 01:56:55.440]  all going to be done on private property everything's going to be done on private property
[01:56:55.440 --> 01:57:00.480]  some of the things they're talking about are drones they're going to be using a lot of drones
[01:57:01.600 --> 01:57:10.800]  this is a spec ops kind of enactment they're going to be using some actors but mostly spec ops
[01:57:10.800 --> 01:57:15.600]  troops they're training they said that they have to keep razor sharp because they've trained for
[01:57:15.600 --> 01:57:22.800]  the last 14 years of war and now they're going to be training for the next 14 years and that of
[01:57:22.800 --> 01:57:27.040]  course is here domestically and what's crazy is they admit it's about winning hearts and minds
[01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:31.600]  they admit all their manuals their new mission is here domestically to fight the patriots the
[01:57:31.600 --> 01:57:40.240]  veterans and then he sits up there and oh well that's a major change then because their own
[01:57:40.240 --> 01:57:50.000]  original announcement plan that we broke over a month ago said that they would be on public land
[01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:55.680]  and in the streets and be simulating illegal suspicious activities so i take it now they're
[01:57:55.680 --> 01:58:02.400]  saying they won't be in the streets and playing close no there's they're saying private property
[01:58:02.400 --> 01:58:05.840]  well see what we're doing is forcing them to dial it back but i'm telling you this means nothing
[01:58:06.400 --> 01:58:11.040]  san Antonio said get out you're not doing this they went ahead did it anyways
[01:58:11.600 --> 01:58:15.920]  just remember that i mean you cannot believe a word comes out of this guy's mouth Joe
[01:58:15.920 --> 01:58:22.640]  you can't and i'm sorry i mean i'm just hurting is there any plan to take on the american people
[01:58:22.640 --> 01:58:30.400]  ever no that's ridiculous i mean i could sit on a five-foot pile of news articles mainstream
[01:58:30.400 --> 01:58:34.960]  admitting this but they're all articles about it's wonderful homeland security trains to fight
[01:58:34.960 --> 01:58:41.520]  their main enemy us and to take our guns nbc reports oh brian williams i mean you know all
[01:58:41.520 --> 01:58:48.880]  the military training to take on the tea party thank god they're so erasers we'll be back third hour
[01:58:52.560 --> 01:58:57.520]  and it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true
[01:58:57.520 --> 01:59:03.360]  nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus all of our children

[02:00:05.520 --> 02:00:12.800]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[02:00:12.800 --> 02:00:21.680]  he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[02:00:23.360 --> 02:00:30.320]  out in south texas they sent a kind of preacher type of thomas mead the snow job the public
[02:00:30.320 --> 02:00:35.200]  but for central texas right outside austin where they're running their main operations against the
[02:00:35.200 --> 02:00:43.200]  enemy force texas for jade helm one five they have army lieutenant colonel mark listoria
[02:00:44.320 --> 02:00:52.880]  la st oria and i was uh talking to joe gennings during the break he said the crowd is really mad
[02:00:52.880 --> 02:00:58.400]  and not buying any of it well i don't know how they could buy it there are listeners mainly a b
[02:01:00.400 --> 02:01:04.480]  there is no exaggeration probably 500 mainstream news articles admitting their training to take
[02:01:04.480 --> 02:01:09.280]  on veterans and gun owners and then there's katrina and then all these videos where citizens go
[02:01:09.280 --> 02:01:14.400]  what's the armored vehicle or the drone for and they go the cops are like this to battle the
[02:01:14.400 --> 02:01:20.400]  veterans they're gonna be attacking any minute well i guess if obama marches foreign trip
[02:01:20.400 --> 02:01:25.040]  center something let's go to the colonel right now and then hear what joe has to say oh they've
[02:01:25.040 --> 02:01:35.520]  brought the former guy up the uh the portley preacher is back uh thomas mead has returned here he is
[02:01:38.640 --> 02:01:43.120]  you know what's happening we've blown your operation as usual i mean you know what you've
[02:01:43.120 --> 02:01:47.600]  done all you've done is start up the beehive now we're not acclimated you just thought we get
[02:01:47.600 --> 02:01:52.560]  acclimated and that'd be the end of it no no no we're going to use this as our own drill
[02:01:52.560 --> 02:01:55.600]  to get people to understand what's happening let's go back to the feed
[02:02:02.480 --> 02:02:05.120]  but they're controlling it by being questions we need statements
[02:02:08.320 --> 02:02:13.440]  i just wanted to clarify will there be any role play done in the community in public
[02:02:15.280 --> 02:02:19.760]  because the reason i'm concerned is because you mentioned that there was a need to blend in with
[02:02:19.760 --> 02:02:24.880]  people from bastron it's going to take place on the problem how does that work
[02:02:29.120 --> 02:02:33.600]  everybody there knows i mean you knew world order just thinks you're going to hit us while
[02:02:33.600 --> 02:02:38.720]  we're asleep not going to happen you're going to have a stand-up fight one of all the questions
[02:02:38.720 --> 02:02:44.720]  are will the people role playing be dressed up as bastron bastropians i mean look at the tsa on
[02:02:44.720 --> 02:02:49.120]  the streets i told you 10 years before they rolled out that was going to happen out i know i watched
[02:02:49.120 --> 02:02:54.400]  it on c-span again we're a big country folks they can't just roll this out in secret but they want to
[02:02:56.880 --> 02:03:00.240]  i want to go back to joe jennings is the audio at least the mayor is a little bit hammered
[02:03:00.240 --> 02:03:03.920]  i see a lot of folks when in full wars come and take it shirts come and take it started
[02:03:03.920 --> 02:03:20.720]  close to bass dropping Gonzalez uh let's hear what this lady has to say we need statements
[02:03:20.720 --> 02:03:25.040]  about militarization of police the acclimation the army admitting their train to take on the
[02:03:25.040 --> 02:03:35.440]  tea party so he'll then deny it and we'll have him by the levos getting to lie man i should have gone
[02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:41.520]  imagine me broadcasting angrily there with a headset that i should have done that actually
[02:03:42.400 --> 02:03:48.080]  cruise doing a great job i mean this guy is so full of it i mean he's like a manure yard
[02:03:48.080 --> 02:03:55.360]  you could hire this guy to fertilize like 10 million crops himself
[02:03:59.280 --> 02:04:02.880]  they're training special forces to take on gun owners it's all over the news
[02:04:03.760 --> 02:04:07.760]  okay and they'll have some real emissions they're legitimate mixed in to confuse the idiot public
[02:04:07.760 --> 02:04:13.120]  kind of like cyanide pills you know tastes like sugar or 80 percent sugar uh let's uh
[02:04:13.120 --> 02:04:16.000]  quick joe jennings you've been listening to the crowd what were you saying their basic
[02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:23.760]  uh attitude ish uh basically they're they're they're trying to figure out why they're doing this

[02:05:01.840 --> 02:05:07.280]  sbac common core standardized test at nathan hell high school last week but students aren't the only
[02:05:07.280 --> 02:05:11.840]  ones walking out on common core earlier this year teachers at the same school passed a resolution
[02:05:11.840 --> 02:05:16.400]  against the common core standardized tests and were threatened by superintendent larry nylan
[02:05:16.400 --> 02:05:20.560]  with the loss of their teaching license if they didn't administer the test according to the seattle

[02:08:33.760 --> 02:08:39.440]  attack people and have an area to wreck simply amazing we're gonna cover that at the bottom of

[02:08:56.400 --> 02:09:04.160]  from this army lieutenant colonel and just the stuff i've heard is outright bull and disinformation
[02:09:05.280 --> 02:09:08.800]  and they're not letting people speak more than about 10 seconds that's what's making them mad
[02:09:08.800 --> 02:09:15.280]  there are well over a thousand people there it looks like uh so this is big news and again they
[02:09:15.280 --> 02:09:19.520]  try to spin it don't be against the military oh we're not against the military we don't want the
[02:09:19.520 --> 02:09:24.960]  military being used for domestic operations and being turned into an arm of the democratic party
[02:09:25.680 --> 02:09:34.640]  their new civilian police force that obama talked about it's that simple and constitutional scholars
[02:09:34.640 --> 02:09:43.360]  are across the board saying the same thing we're saying now joining us is joel gilbert with breaking

[02:09:59.760 --> 02:10:05.360]  and he's gotten an exclusive in-depth interview with the brother the half brother of obama

[02:10:14.480 --> 02:10:20.240]  of his interview uh with his half brother in a moment but this is important uh information

[02:10:26.320 --> 02:10:30.880]  they they pushed the story back to do even more research and to dig even deeper so they've got

[02:10:45.280 --> 02:10:52.720]  guest with this breaking information joel gilbert hi uh alex great to be here uh as i told you
[02:10:52.720 --> 02:10:58.320]  about a week and a half ago i had a big interview i was completing uh this was uh based on my
[02:10:58.320 --> 02:11:05.280]  reaching out to malik obama the alleged half brother of barry uh barack hussein obama and i
[02:11:05.280 --> 02:11:12.320]  sent malik a copy of my dvd of dreams for my real father and uh he watched the film immediately
[02:11:13.040 --> 02:11:20.080]  and he told me at that time that this might be an explanation for why barack was so close to
[02:11:20.080 --> 02:11:25.040]  the kenyan family and he made such a big deal about them politically for his political career
[02:11:25.040 --> 02:11:30.480]  wrote a book about the kenyan obama and as soon as he was elected president malik reports that
[02:11:30.480 --> 02:11:35.360]  barack shunned the kenyan family didn't want anything to do with them and that they've been
[02:11:35.360 --> 02:11:41.600]  so confused and uh when you play these clips we're gonna hear from malik really letting loose
[02:11:41.600 --> 02:11:46.880]  and explaining what he thinks really is going on based on his relationship don't forget malik
[02:11:46.880 --> 02:11:52.400]  obama was obama's best man at his wedding and vice versa obama invited him to chicago to his
[02:11:52.400 --> 02:11:57.920]  community organizing events malik is the one that brought barack to kenya took him to the father's
[02:11:57.920 --> 02:12:05.280]  grave even if you watch the video the full video on youtube or obama's realfather.com malik explains
[02:12:05.280 --> 02:12:11.120]  that barack sent him his manuscript of dreams from my father which had a different title at the time
[02:12:11.120 --> 02:12:17.840]  and asked him to edit it so malik was very close to barack so he's very hurt and confused as to why
[02:12:17.840 --> 02:12:24.880]  as soon as he made this big deal about the kenyan relatives for his political uh definition of who
[02:12:24.880 --> 02:12:31.680]  he was he dropped them right when he got elected regardless this shows he's a total sociopath
[02:12:31.680 --> 02:12:37.440]  or maybe worse that people he's known for decades his dad certainly dated his mother looked like
[02:12:37.440 --> 02:12:41.840]  nothing like her the government threw him out saying he wasn't the dad and people forget all this
[02:12:42.720 --> 02:12:46.320]  frank marshall davis is where obama would live during the summers looks just like him
[02:12:46.320 --> 02:12:51.920]  and i mean that you cover that in your film it's undoubtedly his father uh correct but but to then
[02:12:51.920 --> 02:13:00.560]  just throw his adoptive family away just shows an incredible cold bloodedness but i'm taking away
[02:13:00.560 --> 02:13:06.560]  from what he's saying that barack's half brother says he may not be his brother after all this is
[02:13:06.560 --> 02:13:11.840]  just bombshell is that a fair statement absolutely you'll see when we play the clips uh malik says
[02:13:11.840 --> 02:13:17.520]  that barack looks like frank marshall davis and nothing like his father incredible malik also
[02:13:17.520 --> 02:13:24.800]  said he wants to do a dna test now maybe have a dna showdown i call it uh and uh see what the really
[02:13:24.800 --> 02:13:30.880]  the truth is because he is so hurt all the kenyu feel sorry for these kenyan obamas that uh they
[02:13:30.880 --> 02:13:37.840]  were used uh and humiliated uh when he dropped dropped their connection uh malik tells in the
[02:13:37.840 --> 02:13:44.480]  video the story of when anzai tuni died he went to the white house and he asked barack for to
[02:13:44.480 --> 02:13:49.200]  contribute they needed 20 000 to take her body from boston back to kenya for a funeral
[02:13:49.760 --> 02:13:55.120]  and malik tells the story that barack told him that uh she deserved what she got and that was
[02:13:55.120 --> 02:14:02.240]  too much money uh he also told me privately that barack said i'm not bill gates so the result was
[02:14:02.240 --> 02:14:06.560]  anzai tuni was stuck in boston for a full month where they had to raise money from the public
[02:14:06.560 --> 02:14:13.920]  and uh malik just says he was very hurt because anzai tuni came to the senatorial inauguration
[02:14:13.920 --> 02:14:18.880]  she came to the presidential inauguration she accepted him when he came to boston when he
[02:14:18.880 --> 02:14:26.800]  was in school but she was a prop to be used and then discarded just unprecedented we're
[02:14:26.800 --> 02:14:30.320]  going to play these clips the full interview just went up on your website but this is
[02:14:30.960 --> 02:14:35.040]  i'm rarely this stunned because it's clearly his dad he comes out in the book and says he
[02:14:35.040 --> 02:14:39.840]  owes everything to him and his grandfather was best buddies with him and then his mother
[02:14:39.840 --> 02:14:43.120]  clearly posing in photos with him i mean why would he be spending the summer with him as a
[02:14:43.120 --> 02:14:47.440]  small child it's his son when obama talks about him it looks like he almost cries
[02:14:48.160 --> 02:14:53.760]  in these speeches and then now the family that looks nothing like him but who they kind of
[02:14:53.760 --> 02:15:00.640]  adopted is just thrown away why would he be so arrogant and just throw these props away well
[02:15:00.640 --> 02:15:06.560]  well always in these situations the family is the last to realize it or admit it as to what
[02:15:06.560 --> 02:15:12.480]  happened the family finally gets it that it's just part of their game plan the whole socialist
[02:15:12.480 --> 02:15:20.320]  marxist playbook is use people with a big lie to take power and once you take power the ends
[02:15:20.320 --> 02:15:26.560]  justifies the means they're just old baggage and that's what the kenyon obamas uh have unfortunately
[02:15:26.560 --> 02:15:31.840]  i think come to realize uh they've seen dreams from my real father they all agree that obama looks
[02:15:31.840 --> 02:15:37.760]  just like frank marshall davis and they're saying that only a dna test can solve it at this point
[02:15:37.760 --> 02:15:43.200]  because they just think there has to be an explanation for why he made such a big deal out
[02:15:43.200 --> 02:15:48.640]  of them as his political base and now he knows nothing to do with them it's very it's very sad
[02:15:48.640 --> 02:15:54.240]  i it's a very sad story malik is a good guy i have to also add that a lot of the reporting about
[02:15:54.240 --> 02:15:59.680]  him being involved with all these questionable characters you know he's he shows up with a guru
[02:16:00.320 --> 02:16:07.520]  in india or with muslim brotherhood or with the the jahovah's cult in texas uh what's really happened
[02:16:07.520 --> 02:16:13.440]  is because barack broke his promises from malik's point of view uh to help the village and help the
[02:16:13.440 --> 02:16:20.240]  family he's trying to go wherever he can whenever they invite him to go talk to a group he'll go
[02:16:20.240 --> 02:16:24.560]  so he's a little bit and that's a classic spin thing like i go on japanese tv and therefore
[02:16:24.560 --> 02:16:29.120]  i secretly work for the japanese government but here's the deal this brother was close to him
[02:16:29.120 --> 02:16:35.040]  he used him politically now he won't talk to him he looks nothing like these people i mean it'd be
[02:16:35.040 --> 02:16:39.840]  like if i had a kid with a white lady and the kid came out was black i'd say you know you or was
[02:16:39.840 --> 02:16:45.280]  hispanic and nothing against it i just that's not my child uh i mean these people look nothing
[02:16:45.280 --> 02:16:51.440]  like obama his dad is a spinning image uh frank marshal davis and then he says he shaped him he
[02:16:51.440 --> 02:16:55.840]  lived with him it's his daddy then we got photos of him with his mother but what's incredible is
[02:16:55.840 --> 02:17:01.280]  dr corcy i really respect him world that daily uh you know in many ways pantheon of journalism
[02:17:01.280 --> 02:17:05.360]  i don't think they're being hardcore enough with their headline that obama's half brother
[02:17:05.360 --> 02:17:12.480]  you know obama discarded us the story is i want a dna test you may not really be my family you
[02:17:12.480 --> 02:17:19.760]  look like frank marshal davis uh you know wow i mean talk about a house of cards they put in
[02:17:21.360 --> 02:17:26.080]  his harvard law review that he edited in and michelle statements and all of it that he was
[02:17:26.080 --> 02:17:32.560]  born in kenya so when he saw that later when it didn't add up we would get upset and go after
[02:17:32.560 --> 02:17:37.360]  that instead of what was hiding in plain view there's no doubt you're right this is just added
[02:17:37.360 --> 02:17:42.080]  cherry on top joel gilbert this is so huge i think the headline on the story in the video
[02:17:42.080 --> 02:17:47.440]  we're going to do should be obama's half brother once dna test to prove that he's actually family
[02:17:47.440 --> 02:17:52.640]  thinks that he's frank marshal davis's son subheadline i mean it's just it's incredible
[02:17:53.360 --> 02:17:59.040]  yeah i would agree the kenyan story was cover because obama could never have been elected
[02:17:59.040 --> 02:18:05.120]  if he said my my father was a communist party propagandist and soviet agent who worked on
[02:18:05.120 --> 02:18:12.640]  behalf of the soviet union to try to organize the unions to expel us forces from hawai to allow
[02:18:12.640 --> 02:18:18.240]  for soviet expansion in asia and that's what his father did and he was radicalized if obama said
[02:18:18.240 --> 02:18:23.920]  i was radicalized into this marxist ideology in my teenage years while i was drinking and
[02:18:23.920 --> 02:18:30.160]  smoking pot with my dad frank marshal davis please elect me president i'm gonna support the constitution
[02:18:30.160 --> 02:18:34.240]  so all he did was cut out of my dad although the thing he cut out in the speech we're gonna play
[02:18:34.240 --> 02:18:40.320]  later is my dad we played it last week but he literally sat at the feet for as a child up to
[02:18:40.320 --> 02:18:46.160]  a teenager with frank marshal davis the spitting image that his grandpa's best friends with that
[02:18:46.160 --> 02:18:54.000]  he lived with i mean this is hiding in plain view of course they had to have a cutout for the left
[02:18:54.000 --> 02:19:00.000]  that he was an immigrant then that story doesn't fit so we go after it this is incredible you deserve
[02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:07.280]  the Pulitzer prize well thank you i i think look obama engaged in misdirection he uses misdirection
[02:19:07.280 --> 02:19:12.960]  and outright lies to hide the reality don't forget he ran as a mainstream candidate i'm
[02:19:12.960 --> 02:19:17.920]  going to cut the deficit in half i'm going to support israel i'm against gay marriage it was
[02:19:17.920 --> 02:19:23.280]  all mainstream but it was an intentional deception just like i show in my movie there's no place like
[02:19:23.280 --> 02:19:30.160]  utopia the wizard of us never intended to keep any of those promises obama's intentional deception
[02:19:30.160 --> 02:19:35.120]  is the fraud of the century that's been perpetrated on the american people and the kenyon obamas are
[02:19:35.120 --> 02:19:42.800]  now on to it they're on to it there's another headline oh kenyon obamas now on to the fact
[02:19:42.800 --> 02:19:48.720]  that he's an impostor and a fraud he's a davis he's got the last name of the confederate founder
[02:19:48.720 --> 02:19:59.280]  you can't make this stuff up bad i'm telling you i know you're right i've seen both your films i've
[02:19:59.280 --> 02:20:04.880]  researched it and i remember saying when when day one the birth certificate had like six layers
[02:20:05.440 --> 02:20:11.280]  and it was the font of microsoft that's the fake typewriter font you know because each typewriter
[02:20:11.280 --> 02:20:15.280]  font is like a snowflake it's it's it's it's different they were all identical it was totally
[02:20:15.280 --> 02:20:21.840]  fake right there i was like why is it such a bad forgery because it was meant to make us go crazy
[02:20:22.560 --> 02:20:29.920]  like mad dogs after a steak right the question never was where's the birth certificate the question
[02:20:29.920 --> 02:20:35.840]  was who is the real father and if you ask the right question you can find the right answer exactly
[02:20:35.840 --> 02:20:42.320]  they threw a fake question out to divert us right and uh i like to tell people now that all this time
[02:20:42.320 --> 02:20:47.600]  we've been complaining about obama but if you listen to malik obama in the interview he's been
[02:20:47.600 --> 02:20:53.600]  treating us like family all this time he's really barry davis he's barry davis frank
[02:20:53.600 --> 02:21:00.000]  marshal davis jr not just the fact that obama lied to misdirect us but he hid the fact that he was
[02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:06.640]  radicalized into a marxist ideologies that sees the world completely different from mainstream
[02:21:06.640 --> 02:21:12.080]  america he believes america is the source of all problems in the world he believes that capitalism
[02:21:12.080 --> 02:21:17.040]  in free markets and free speech freedom of religion are all negative things and he wants to fulfill
[02:21:17.040 --> 02:21:21.680]  his father's dream you know the media is gonna i predict they're gonna ignore this because it's
[02:21:21.680 --> 02:21:25.200]  right on target when i would cover the birth certificate stuff and say all i know is it's
[02:21:25.200 --> 02:21:30.800]  fake all i know is he said he was from kenya i don't know if he really is but here's a video of
[02:21:30.800 --> 02:21:36.320]  him saying he's from kenya here's his wife saying it uh here he is in the harvard review that he
[02:21:36.320 --> 02:21:42.480]  edited over and over again saying i'm from kenya uh he you know he ran on the senate uh in in
[02:21:42.480 --> 02:21:49.360]  illinois on that so don't get mad at me meanwhile the whole time he was frank marshal davis jr
[02:21:49.360 --> 02:21:56.480]  let's go to a clip of him from c span talking about his father frank marshal davis and then
[02:21:56.480 --> 02:22:02.240]  we'll uh go back to the crew uh and the passage finally ends with me having a conversation with
[02:22:02.240 --> 02:22:07.760]  a close friend of my maternal grandfather a close friend of gramps a black man from kansas named
[02:22:07.760 --> 02:22:14.560]  frank uh actually uh at the time fairly well-known poet named frank marshal davis who had moved to
[02:22:14.560 --> 02:22:20.720]  hawaii and lived there uh and so i have a discussion with him about the kinds of frustrations i'm
[02:22:20.720 --> 02:22:27.520]  having and and uh he sort of schools me on uh that i should get used to uh these frustrations so
[02:22:27.520 --> 02:22:33.440]  let me dig in frank marshal davis's son is now president and is now running the country into
[02:22:33.440 --> 02:22:38.800]  the ground deliberately i mean that's why they say truth is stranger than fiction this is so
[02:22:39.520 --> 02:22:45.280]  sensational and you can just see the truth you can feel it joe gilbert i can almost not
[02:22:45.280 --> 02:22:50.720]  continue broadcasting at this point what do we even do about this i mean it just totally makes
[02:22:50.720 --> 02:22:56.560]  sense now everything that's happening well unfortunately we've had a media as well as
[02:22:56.560 --> 02:23:01.840]  a an adoring crowd of uh democrats and others that have been willing to follow barack obama
[02:23:01.840 --> 02:23:09.280]  into oncoming traffic no matter how horrific the situation is internationally no matter how horrific
[02:23:09.280 --> 02:23:16.480]  the economy is they simply use the tools of state uh the irs the press office to lie about
[02:23:16.480 --> 02:23:23.040]  everything unemployment is five percent uh we support israel there's peace in the world uh the
[02:23:23.040 --> 02:23:29.520]  it's an era of disinformation soviet era disinformation and that's what you get from a
[02:23:29.520 --> 02:23:35.440]  man whose father was a bolshevik and a and a soviet agent and someone who was indoctrinated
[02:23:35.440 --> 02:23:41.920]  into this ideology uh we just have to keep on keeping on alex you're doing a great job and we
[02:23:41.920 --> 02:23:47.040]  if america if roam could survive nero we should be able to survive obama for another year and a
[02:23:47.040 --> 02:23:53.200]  half and hopefully uh a new administration can turn around all the damage that's been done
[02:23:54.320 --> 02:23:59.680]  well joe gilbert uh i've been jumping in here a lot and making some good points but hyperventilating
[02:23:59.680 --> 02:24:07.280]  at the same time spend a few minutes recap how you discovered this how you made the film the bomb
[02:24:07.280 --> 02:24:12.560]  shell and i'm getting chills and then now what this means as the family begins to come out and say
[02:24:12.560 --> 02:24:18.480]  we always say didn't look like us we want a dna test it was already you know really weird with
[02:24:18.480 --> 02:24:25.520]  my uncle yeah he dropped us like a hot potato yeah i mean that is amazing yeah well how i got into it
[02:24:25.520 --> 02:24:30.960]  i made a film about the iranian nuclear program called atomic jihad obama's politics of defeat
[02:24:30.960 --> 02:24:36.240]  that was 2010 and like a lot of people i would read jerry coursey and jack cashill's writings
[02:24:36.240 --> 02:24:41.840]  about the birth certificate and they never had an answer and i said to myself simply
[02:24:41.840 --> 02:24:45.920]  if they can't find the answer they're not asking the right question but i didn't know what the
[02:24:45.920 --> 02:24:51.520]  question was so i read about this guy named frank in dreams of my father uh you know obama's
[02:24:51.520 --> 02:24:56.960]  biography and it was filled with references to this mentor named frank and i read online they
[02:24:56.960 --> 02:25:02.720]  said he thought it was frank marshall davis this communist in hawaii so i simply bought frank's
[02:25:02.720 --> 02:25:08.000]  autobiography called live in the blues and it's full of photos and as a person who does film and
[02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:14.480]  graphics i'm looking at these photos of frank marshall davis they look just like obama and
[02:25:14.480 --> 02:25:21.600]  they were just clicked that that uh this kenyan story was just a cover for a radical ideology
[02:25:22.240 --> 02:25:27.920]  uh once i realized that i realized america was in grave danger and i decided that i have to
[02:25:27.920 --> 02:25:32.880]  commit myself to looking further into this and getting all the information i can and right at
[02:25:32.880 --> 02:25:37.920]  that moment i said i'm gonna make a movie about frank marshall davis about obama's real life story
[02:25:37.920 --> 02:25:43.280]  in the dreams from his real father in the process you get contacted and they give you the porn photos
[02:25:43.280 --> 02:25:48.880]  a mama in the house with davis and other women because he funded himself with porn a communist
[02:25:48.880 --> 02:25:54.240]  did that and correct and and then there's photos of obama sitting on the same couch with the same
[02:25:54.240 --> 02:26:01.680]  pictures i mean we got obama sitting on the porn shoot couch exactly we got we got we've got him
[02:26:01.680 --> 02:26:07.040]  at every level yeah we don't even need those photos there's a 20 or 30 pieces of evidence that
[02:26:07.040 --> 02:26:13.280]  shows that uh barack obama's father is frank marshall davis more important there's a ton of
[02:26:13.280 --> 02:26:17.600]  evidence and a mountain of evidence i show in the film that davis became his ideological
[02:26:17.600 --> 02:26:23.920]  mentor and radicalized obama in his youth uh the nude photos simply show the opportunity for
[02:26:23.920 --> 02:26:30.560]  that relationship to have taken place and uh the photos show all these different strippers
[02:26:30.560 --> 02:26:35.760]  hawaiian portuguese looking american we see frank marshall davis's jacket in the background the
[02:26:35.760 --> 02:26:42.880]  floorboards match the jazz records match and face matches everything matches so between all of that
[02:26:43.440 --> 02:26:49.280]  and all the other evidence it's clear that frank marshall davis is the biological father now that
[02:26:49.280 --> 02:26:55.600]  would have been fine if he hadn't been radicalized or if barack had learned later that everything
[02:26:55.600 --> 02:27:01.760]  his father told him was a bunch of bunk and it was destructive and irrelevant but he simply
[02:27:01.760 --> 02:27:06.960]  stayed in that world of american marxism that no one really knows about went to new york then
[02:27:06.960 --> 02:27:11.360]  chicago with the heirs family where bill heirs family brought him into chicago where he was in
[02:27:11.360 --> 02:27:18.480]  the radical groups like acorn midwest academy and has lived his life as this american radical
[02:27:18.480 --> 02:27:23.600]  and he simply decided instead of he learned a lesson from his mentor bill heirs bill heirs
[02:27:23.600 --> 02:27:27.120]  would look you in the eye in the late 60s and say we're going to destroy the constitution we're
[02:27:27.120 --> 02:27:32.480]  going to bring down america it didn't work because it was evil uh they throw him in jail his buddies
[02:27:32.480 --> 02:27:37.280]  got thrown in jail they had to go in the underground for 10 years bill heirs taught him the lesson
[02:27:37.280 --> 02:27:42.320]  when he came out of the underground the early 80s he said look people in the eye and don't tell them
[02:27:42.320 --> 02:27:47.600]  the truth tell them you want to help people tell them you want to help families call them folks
[02:27:48.240 --> 02:27:53.600]  and you'll get people to support you when you take power you can begin the work of destruction
[02:27:53.600 --> 02:27:58.400]  that they laid out in the 60s to bring down americans and now they admit cloward and piven they
[02:27:58.400 --> 02:28:04.720]  admit everything they are so evil and the elites are allowing them to do this the big foundations
[02:28:04.720 --> 02:28:08.640]  are involved they believe out of this communist revolution they're going to get their world

[02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:50.080]  party or godowners what no way then the videos come in from all over the country as the training
[02:33:50.080 --> 02:33:56.560]  intensifies they're up on info wars dot com and i'm telling you obama and the globalists could set
[02:33:56.560 --> 02:34:02.160]  off weapons blaming on patriots i mean the sky's the limit they're not going to go easily um finishing
[02:34:02.160 --> 02:34:07.760]  up joe gilbert lead us into this other clip where he talks about uh not even thinking he may be his
[02:34:07.760 --> 02:34:13.920]  brother well i sent uh reached out to malik obama and uh sent him my dvd dreams for my real father
[02:34:13.920 --> 02:34:20.560]  you know in canya sent him a copy he watched it right away and uh he told me on the phone he said
[02:34:20.560 --> 02:34:27.680]  look uh barack looks just like frank marshall davis and he said maybe this explains why he was so
[02:34:27.680 --> 02:34:33.680]  close to me all my life and then won't want nothing to do with me anymore or the rest of the canyon
[02:34:33.680 --> 02:34:40.080]  so it's almost a sad story when you watch the uh interview with malik uh they've all come to realize
[02:34:40.080 --> 02:34:45.360]  that they've been conned just like the rest of us well and i've studied that whole african culture
[02:34:45.360 --> 02:34:54.160]  as well the kenyans are some of the most patriotic smart uh outstanding noble groups in africa and
[02:34:54.160 --> 02:35:00.400]  i don't know how they couldn't see he looks nothing like them i mean these people look
[02:35:00.400 --> 02:35:06.240]  nothing like him his dad looked nothing like him right and the worst thing is in american culture
[02:35:06.240 --> 02:35:11.760]  if you stop talking to a relative we all have a relative we maybe don't talk to it's not considered
[02:35:11.760 --> 02:35:17.840]  such a big deal in kenyan culture they you have to give the respect to the oldest brother he's
[02:35:17.840 --> 02:35:23.600]  the patriarch of the family and they're in if anyone who disowns the family or doesn't respect
[02:35:23.600 --> 02:35:29.840]  the older brother it is considered a big humiliation and obama's going to kenya i think in july
[02:35:29.840 --> 02:35:35.520]  and he hasn't contacted malik there's no plans to see him and it's terribly demeaning in this culture
[02:35:35.520 --> 02:35:42.080]  so he says that obama has just been a extremely uh hypocritical and he's turned his back on them
[02:35:42.080 --> 02:35:46.560]  and it's an it's not his family and i'm and i'm glad they're starting to wake up i mean if somebody
[02:35:46.560 --> 02:35:51.200]  was closing my my brother looked nothing like me i'd be like you buddy we don't have the same daddy
[02:35:51.200 --> 02:35:55.600]  i'm here to tell you uh no rocket scientist but i can tell it's kind of like the character king of
[02:35:55.600 --> 02:35:59.360]  the hill whereas kid looks nothing like him but he goes he has no ideas why he's been cheating on him
[02:35:59.360 --> 02:36:07.120]  for 10 years uh let's let's go ahead and go to this final clip malik i sent you my movie a few
[02:36:07.120 --> 02:36:13.840]  months ago dreams for my real father uh when did you first watch it uh when you sent it to me
[02:36:15.040 --> 02:36:22.320]  so do you think that barack looks like frank marshall davis this is a man that he said raised him
[02:36:22.320 --> 02:36:30.240]  more than your father there's a great resemblance yeah i think frank marshall davis and barack
[02:36:30.240 --> 02:36:38.640]  they look alike some kind of moles i see on his face and uh he has those two there's a resemblance
[02:36:38.640 --> 02:36:44.800]  and does he resemble your father not really i don't you know they say about the years and
[02:36:44.800 --> 02:36:54.640]  but no uh no your movie definitely you know puts a lot of questions in my mind well would you like
[02:36:54.640 --> 02:37:03.440]  to see or do a dna test one day to know for sure that would really prove right whether we're related
[02:37:03.440 --> 02:37:10.960]  or not yes i would i would be willing to do that i don't know how i would deal with it if i really

[02:37:48.160 --> 02:37:54.640]  the way that he's treated america politically that is deception say one thing and do another
[02:37:54.640 --> 02:37:59.120]  he's done with the family as well and then his cousin is running the muslim brotherhood there

[02:38:13.280 --> 02:38:17.440]  what to say if you go back to the videos we did on the day that birth certificate was released
[02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:22.880]  and the way the media played it up when it was so obviously fake and that and then and
[02:38:22.880 --> 02:38:26.480]  something didn't add up and we were going with it he wasn't born here
[02:38:29.600 --> 02:38:32.960]  and then they put out that fake birth certificate to throw us off the trail and
[02:38:32.960 --> 02:38:38.320]  all i kept saying is they're lying these are forgeries i don't know what's behind it but it's
[02:38:38.320 --> 02:38:44.480]  not true and i said over and over again we can find the video we don't know who his daddy is
[02:38:44.480 --> 02:38:50.960]  he doesn't look like he something else is going on here i never came out and said
[02:38:51.840 --> 02:38:57.360]  you know hundred percent this is a kenyan deal i said his whole past is bizarre the fake names the
[02:38:57.360 --> 02:39:05.680]  the mosque in indonesia the berry sataro the the the grandfather the cia the frank marshall davis the
[02:39:05.680 --> 02:39:14.720]  weirdness the weirdness of a cia high-level guy summer after summer leaving his grandson when
[02:39:14.720 --> 02:39:22.560]  the mother is out of town doing work for the cia with a top communist and then by the way
[02:39:22.560 --> 02:39:27.280]  frank marshall davis for looking up was a mixed race and a lot of times you splice white genetics
[02:39:27.280 --> 02:39:33.280]  with black genetics you get those moles and obama's got that again in the exact same spots as frank
[02:39:33.280 --> 02:39:41.520]  marshall davis i mean he's got the moles in the same spots i mean he's got his daddy spots i mean
[02:39:42.560 --> 02:39:47.040]  i don't look like that much like my dad he looks i mean i look like my daddy you see me and my
[02:39:47.040 --> 02:39:53.040]  dad well this is your father yes looks just like me just not as big and doesn't and and and his fat
[02:39:53.040 --> 02:40:00.960]  is me that's it they go that's your daddy isn't it yeah looks just like me but i don't look as much
[02:40:00.960 --> 02:40:09.280]  like i mean obama as frank marshall davis in fact if you look up earlier frank marshall davis photos
[02:40:09.280 --> 02:40:16.320]  when he wasn't old and compare him to obama it is just stunning absolutely stunning and they always
[02:40:16.320 --> 02:40:20.720]  cover obama up in tv interviews to cover the the moles he's got over his face but they both had
[02:40:20.720 --> 02:40:30.080]  about 15 moles on their cheeks i mean in the same spots in fact davis even had a larger mole
[02:40:30.080 --> 02:40:34.240]  up on the side of his nose obama had one even bigger i mean right in the same spot
[02:40:36.480 --> 02:40:43.600]  man that's crazy that is his daddy look at the ears look at the chin look at the neck
[02:40:43.600 --> 02:40:51.360]  look at the hair look at the skull i mean that is his daddy
[02:40:54.320 --> 02:40:58.720]  i'm just speechless at this point again radio listeners are like look what do you mean look
[02:40:58.720 --> 02:41:04.160]  we simulcast on tv to document everything at info wars dot com forward slash show
[02:41:05.280 --> 02:41:10.240]  hand on some cable and tv systems around the country as well i'm meeting today it's it's been
[02:41:10.240 --> 02:41:16.480]  all been my fault not my cruise on um going ahead and pulling the trigger on some multi-year
[02:41:16.480 --> 02:41:20.880]  contracts for some different satellite systems and file sharing systems and tv systems then i've
[02:41:20.880 --> 02:41:26.160]  got to plow through the 70 or 80 tv stations and cable systems that have already been
[02:41:26.160 --> 02:41:29.680]  sending us letters over the last couple years that we launched the news and have been developing it
[02:41:29.680 --> 02:41:34.080]  and you know getting an even more focused to then start picking it up and then i'm gonna do a whole
[02:41:34.080 --> 02:41:39.760]  drive with a media packet that will send you or whatever station you want uh to reach out to your
[02:41:39.760 --> 02:41:46.080]  local u h f v h f uh and local cable systems because we have listeners in the management
[02:41:47.280 --> 02:41:53.040]  of hundreds of stations around the country i mean they already air like on big tv stations
[02:41:53.040 --> 02:41:56.240]  my documentaries and stuff without me even asking what you're fully authorized to do
[02:41:56.240 --> 02:42:00.640]  they would blanket release to do it uh but uh now we're gonna have it on satellite with a
[02:42:00.640 --> 02:42:04.400]  computer coded where it says free to air do whatever you want and we're gonna have it on
[02:42:04.400 --> 02:42:09.120]  these file sharing systems of the news networks there's a lot of hoops we got to jump through
[02:42:09.120 --> 02:42:15.600]  with copyright you name it we've been doing that and it's just gonna be beautiful but i've got to
[02:42:15.600 --> 02:42:19.200]  it's like we're a rocket we've kind of gotten off the ground and we're speeding up we're at about
[02:42:19.200 --> 02:42:25.200]  50 000 feet but they've got artillery shooting at us but we're starting to lift out past the
[02:42:25.200 --> 02:42:30.000]  level of the artillery uh as we go into the stratosphere and then to the edge of space and
[02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:36.480]  once we get into orbit literally uh with the satellites and everything you mean fire it will
[02:42:36.480 --> 02:42:41.840]  come out and decode it for a palpatine but you know i've given the analogy before that
[02:42:42.720 --> 02:42:46.960]  i threw all this coal in the engine of the steam train you helped me get the coal to do it
[02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:51.360]  and i got up to the top of the mountain i thought i was going to and i looked over there was like
[02:42:51.360 --> 02:42:56.800]  other mountains even bigger and i realized i've got to accelerate downhill with all the coal i've
[02:42:56.800 --> 02:43:03.040]  got and just go for it all so there is kind of been a hesitation here last year or so
[02:43:03.040 --> 02:43:08.560]  so as we try to nail everything else down perfect things redesign websites launch a lot of new
[02:43:08.560 --> 02:43:14.160]  platforms a lot of stuff goes into this and there's a money issue um we got a nice studio
[02:43:14.160 --> 02:43:20.080]  and stuff but that's nothing compared to bandwidth and uh paying crew and equipment and you know all
[02:43:20.080 --> 02:43:26.720]  the rest of it that goes into things like every spring fruit flies get all over the grass outside
[02:43:26.720 --> 02:43:30.560]  if we don't get the doors locked in any water out of the way there's fruit flies get in the
[02:43:30.560 --> 02:43:36.560]  office you know crap like that or uh people leaving stuff in the halls or you know dealing with
[02:43:37.440 --> 02:43:44.080]  other stuff that happens this is a real operation and i'm making the decisions and believe me i'm
[02:43:44.080 --> 02:43:50.000]  looking for people we found some who can actually come up with plans execute things get jobs done
[02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:55.920]  around here so uh info wars.com is ready to go the next level are we able ever able to reconnect
[02:43:55.920 --> 02:44:01.280]  with joe begs yeah we've connected with joe oh good thanks thank you i knew we couldn't connect
[02:44:02.240 --> 02:44:08.640]  while we had gilbert on so i was waiting for that thank you um let's go ahead now and go to joe
[02:44:08.640 --> 02:44:14.080]  begs out there covering jade helm one five the kickoff in bass drop texas joe i know you've
[02:44:14.080 --> 02:44:20.160]  been out there for six hours or so now uh hey how many people uh it looked like a thousand if there
[02:44:20.160 --> 02:44:25.200]  were a bunch of rooms filled outside of there uh what was the overall feel what did you pick up
[02:44:25.200 --> 02:44:30.800]  from this lieutenant colonel um well what i picked up from the lieutenant colonel was completed in
[02:44:30.800 --> 02:44:36.560]  total bs i mean the guy was just spouting off questions that he you know simply had written
[02:44:37.120 --> 02:44:42.160]  and uh given to him essentially i mean got her answers he had to keep looking over to this guy
[02:44:42.160 --> 02:44:47.840]  in a suit for uh a confirmation on uh you know questions and answers that people were asking
[02:44:47.840 --> 02:44:53.360]  and the mood quite frankly here at the courthouse is get this operation jade helm out of bass drop
[02:44:53.360 --> 02:44:59.680]  get it out of texas we don't want to hear uh how many people because i'm told there was downstairs
[02:44:59.680 --> 02:45:04.640]  auditorium full other rooms full people out the door the room looked like it held about 300 it
[02:45:04.640 --> 02:45:09.520]  was jam packed standing room everywhere uh you're a good judge how many people joe begs former staff
[02:45:09.520 --> 02:45:15.040]  sergeant us army how many people do you think you saw there yeah there was definitely a uh a few
[02:45:15.040 --> 02:45:20.000]  hundred all together i mean the the room that we were in then the main actual hearing is only
[02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:25.440]  supposed to hold about 50 60 people and we had over 100 people crammed in there and then you also
[02:45:25.440 --> 02:45:29.680]  had another area where they had a viewing television as well a lot of people showed up a lot of people
[02:45:29.680 --> 02:45:34.640]  answered the call to come out end up against this exercise and a lot of good questions were asked
[02:45:34.640 --> 02:45:40.480]  but a lot of this you know typical you know scythe you know questions to kind of beat around the
[02:45:40.480 --> 02:45:46.000]  entire actual question to sell for you know there's what the answers is that the lieutenant colonel uh
[02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:54.960]  gave joe begs uh what about him saying oh we're not going to be in plain clothes uh outside of
[02:45:54.960 --> 02:46:00.960]  private property when their own manual and their news article interviews for last month all said
[02:46:00.960 --> 02:46:07.840]  that he laughed at that and acted like we'd made something up yet again yeah he definitely went
[02:46:07.840 --> 02:46:13.040]  when real questions were asked based off of their own documents that they put out there
[02:46:13.040 --> 02:46:18.080]  on the internet when people ask questions pertaining to that he would kind of smirk and laugh and
[02:46:18.080 --> 02:46:22.080]  almost like where did you get this idea from this is completely crazy that you would even
[02:46:22.080 --> 02:46:27.120]  think that we're doing this that we're going to be you know operating suspiciously and all that
[02:46:27.120 --> 02:46:32.160]  you know they completely denied that they said that all these operations would be uh be conducted
[02:46:32.160 --> 02:46:37.920]  on private property and they said that the people who own this private property decided to contact
[02:46:37.920 --> 02:46:43.920]  jade stock decided to but they didn't know because there was a guy who was sitting beside me who his
[02:46:43.920 --> 02:46:51.280]  neighbor was uh they came to him the people of jade helm came to her property and asked
[02:46:51.280 --> 02:46:56.080]  if they could operate there but he's going out here and telling everyone that no these people
[02:46:56.080 --> 02:47:01.440]  volunteered they contacted the military and said they wanted to use it because that's their page got
[02:47:01.440 --> 02:47:08.240]  to you joe biggs i want to come back to you in a moment to break down some of the things you
[02:47:08.240 --> 02:47:13.360]  witnessed i i noticed that david night has come into the control room uh david night of course
[02:47:13.360 --> 02:47:17.840]  frequently uh hosts this radio broadcasts and anchors the nightly news with you and others
[02:47:17.840 --> 02:47:24.640]  i want to find out his take on the situation uh david yeah alex i spoke to uh my wife actually
[02:47:24.640 --> 02:47:29.520]  she sent me a text because we don't live too far from bass drop and this is what she told me she
[02:47:29.520 --> 02:47:34.160]  said i spoke to a news reporter who was wearing a red and black dress afterwards asked her if she
[02:47:34.160 --> 02:47:39.440]  thought there were more people against it than for it she said it was exactly equal and my wife
[02:47:39.440 --> 02:47:44.160]  was very upset about that she said that absolutely was not the case in the large overflow room downstairs
[02:47:44.160 --> 02:47:49.840]  where she was she says i don't think that's the case where joe and uh jacari we were watching the
[02:47:49.840 --> 02:47:55.920]  feed i'd say about 90 percent were against 10 percent were just cordial uh joe biggs what would
[02:47:55.920 --> 02:47:59.200]  you say what that's how they're gonna spin it though of course yeah well it shows incredible
[02:47:59.200 --> 02:48:04.560]  deception people oppose operations aid help 98 percent of the people up there posted there was
[02:48:04.560 --> 02:48:10.000]  there was like two obama supporters who were just all giddy about it oh they love the idea hold on
[02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:14.880]  they're the ones we're kind of like incredibly you're saying what percentage joe biggs 98
[02:48:14.880 --> 02:48:18.800]  percent did not want to hear they want it out of texas they don't want it in bass drop they don't
[02:48:18.800 --> 02:48:23.600]  want it anywhere well that's what i saw from the video but i said 90 just to be safe uh are you
[02:48:23.600 --> 02:48:28.480]  saying that your wife uh was actually in the overflow room uh david night yes she was she was
[02:48:28.480 --> 02:48:33.120]  a great family sorry what a great family that see your wife's not even reporting for us but
[02:48:33.120 --> 02:48:37.840]  she's there covering this because you live out there uh simply amazing uh that she talked to
[02:48:37.840 --> 02:48:42.880]  the reporter and she spun that at her it shows how it's getting everyone the media the police
[02:48:42.880 --> 02:48:48.240]  to go along with the deception absolutely and it'll be interesting to see which news organization
[02:48:48.240 --> 02:48:53.120]  this is it has a reporter in a red and black dress see how they spin this if they're telling people
[02:48:53.120 --> 02:48:57.920]  what is your wife think about that well she was uh she's very concerned about it just like all the
[02:48:57.920 --> 02:49:01.840]  rest of people there she's very upset about it i mean we just went into bass drop yesterday and we
[02:49:01.840 --> 02:49:07.040]  saw some people there with a joint task force homeland security on there but uh i think actually
[02:49:07.040 --> 02:49:10.720]  they're part of the texas national guard we looked up the organization that they were with
[02:49:11.440 --> 02:49:16.480]  i just have a concern with seeing military everywhere i go i mean even though we're close to
[02:49:16.480 --> 02:49:21.120]  an area where they do training we don't typically see military out there like we've seen them in
[02:49:21.120 --> 02:49:26.720]  the last couple weeks well said david night well said i mean that's what this is all about
[02:49:27.440 --> 02:49:32.640]  just the 10 or 15 times we dialed in for a minute or so just to get a smattering of what was being
[02:49:32.640 --> 02:49:40.080]  said joe begs i heard about a third of the people bringing up hey uh you know military's being trained
[02:49:40.080 --> 02:49:44.480]  to take all the american people and he would just deny that when it's in their own manuals joe
[02:49:44.480 --> 02:49:51.440]  yeah exactly i mean they have the documentation saying they have training for that and it's
[02:49:51.440 --> 02:49:54.960]  stuff that they've done in the past you know we saw the things that happened with patrina we've
[02:49:54.960 --> 02:49:59.840]  seen them in other operations as well uh there i mean the people have a right to be concerned about
[02:49:59.840 --> 02:50:04.720]  this and quite frankly i don't think these jade helm architects who showed up today did anything
[02:50:04.720 --> 02:50:10.160]  whatsoever to calm anybody whatsoever all they did was add further speculation as to what's
[02:50:10.160 --> 02:50:15.200]  really going on but they're very vague and you know just senseless answers as to what they were
[02:50:15.200 --> 02:50:22.160]  you know to the questions imagine being that kernel i mean imagine having to sit up there
[02:50:22.160 --> 02:50:26.880]  in america that he's now been ordered to target it's been declassified he's engaged in a scyop
[02:50:27.440 --> 02:50:34.080]  where do they find people like this well he's just a talking head the guy who actually is running
[02:50:34.080 --> 02:50:39.200]  operation is thomas mead of metrus global that was a suit that you could see in the video to the
[02:50:39.200 --> 02:50:44.880]  bite of the lieutenant colonel that was just sitting there uh all he would do is he would nod
[02:50:44.880 --> 02:50:49.760]  and look at the kernel and kind of give him suggestive answers as to what was going on no one
[02:50:49.760 --> 02:50:54.960]  could speak to this guy we couldn't get anything from him whatsoever but he stay there we gotta go

[02:55:47.280 --> 02:55:52.000]  i've been jumping in and david's been jumping in other points i wanted to get jacarion but he
[02:55:52.000 --> 02:55:56.640]  i guess he's too busy interviewing folks for the nightly news doing a great job and i guess
[02:55:56.640 --> 02:56:04.000]  josh owens is out there with you now overall what's your takeaway from this my takeaway is the the
[02:56:04.000 --> 02:56:10.080]  globalist looked freaked out the scyops guy looked freaked out the colonel looked freaked out uh they
[02:56:10.080 --> 02:56:17.760]  know the people are fully awake and uh are aware of what they're doing i feel like you said uh 90
[02:56:17.760 --> 02:56:24.000]  percent of the people oppose this entire operation people were completely sorry sorry make your
[02:56:24.000 --> 02:56:34.400]  point they didn't grab jacari do what i just saw jacari drive walk by grab him okay hold on i'm
[02:56:34.400 --> 02:56:39.520]  sorry i'm sorry make your point then get jacari i just saw him walk by i was wanting to get him on
[02:56:39.520 --> 02:56:45.520]  earlier uh alex wants to talk to you but hold on joe i want you to finish so we're gonna talk to you
[02:56:45.520 --> 02:56:50.560]  i just wanted to get him for the show he's not gonna escape coming on air i'm gonna get him on
[02:56:50.560 --> 02:56:57.680]  air but joe what's your takeaway from it uh in closing well my takeaway from this thus far is
[02:56:57.680 --> 02:57:02.960]  that these guys came very ill prepared they did not have the answers to questions that they should
[02:57:02.960 --> 02:57:08.880]  have had um they backpedaled quite a bit in their answering on stuff um they said that they would be
[02:57:10.400 --> 02:57:14.640]  operations only on private property and then that one time he goes well maybe there could be some
[02:57:14.640 --> 02:57:19.360]  that are off and then you know he said well there might just be two humbees but then there might be
[02:57:19.360 --> 02:57:24.320]  more you know there was back and forth and people kept asking the same questions in different ways
[02:57:24.320 --> 02:57:29.200]  to kind of throw the guy off and it worked because we could catch him stumbling quite a bit so i think
[02:57:29.200 --> 02:57:33.760]  they came out here thinking that most people weren't going to show up even the uh the judge even was
[02:57:33.760 --> 02:57:38.000]  like wow i'm really surprised this many people showed up especially ones who are knowledgeable
[02:57:38.000 --> 02:57:43.600]  about what's going on who have actually uh looked into this entire operation and have been following
[02:57:43.600 --> 02:57:48.880]  it for quite some time well that freaks politicians out because they don't know a political class of
[02:57:48.880 --> 02:57:54.480]  people that are actually awake and aware uh and you know your knowledge of the military my research
[02:57:54.480 --> 02:58:00.720]  and knowledge of it tracking this the public's knowledge this sends a message of the establishment
[02:58:00.720 --> 02:58:05.440]  that they're not going to get away uh with just slowly implementing martial law job
[02:58:07.680 --> 02:58:13.600]  yes exactly i want to do five minutes to overdrive so grab jacar before he splits great job i want
[02:58:13.600 --> 02:58:17.680]  to come back talk to jacar for five minutes then we'll put a bow on this because we're done and
[02:58:17.680 --> 02:58:24.320]  then we're going to be back tonight seven o'clock central info wars nightly news listen this is the

[03:00:07.760 --> 03:00:17.520]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network there's a new headline on info wars dot com
[03:00:21.200 --> 03:00:23.760]  black gorilla family that's a black supremacist group
[03:00:26.560 --> 03:00:30.320]  says the bloods and the cribs plan to take out baltimore cops as a response
[03:00:32.000 --> 03:00:36.400]  and the mayor says well they're allowing rioting in certain areas i mean this is all
[03:00:36.400 --> 03:00:40.880]  all trying to get a summer of rage going as a pretext but military on the streets
[03:00:40.880 --> 03:00:46.320]  it's pure psi up obama sending people to the funeral delegation simply to hype this up
[03:00:47.360 --> 03:00:51.440]  we need to send a crew out one of our reporters was just saying mckayl failen
[03:00:51.440 --> 03:00:57.360]  with signs saying black lives matter at abortuaries because that's where the real killing's going on
[03:00:58.800 --> 03:01:02.640]  and people say well why are you giving that idea we're going to do it because i don't care
[03:01:02.640 --> 03:01:06.880]  people who start doing that that's what the real black lives matter uh jacari jackson you've been
[03:01:06.880 --> 03:01:11.200]  there since nine this morning great job with joe begs and others for the info wars crew
[03:01:11.200 --> 03:01:16.320]  you're out front the judicial building where they have the county council we call them county
[03:01:16.320 --> 03:01:22.320]  commissioners here um very interesting video that i saw but you were there for the whole time
[03:01:22.320 --> 03:01:28.400]  what's your takeaway overall today jacari jackson well it seems to me alex that the people are very
[03:01:28.400 --> 03:01:33.040]  much apprehensive of the drill in general some people were completely against it other
[03:01:34.320 --> 03:01:41.200]  one way or the other and i was very curious that the commission in the uh the spokesman
[03:01:41.200 --> 03:01:44.720]  really wouldn't hear their concerns as far as canceling the drill they said yeah we're here
[03:01:44.720 --> 03:01:49.040]  to talk to people but it really wasn't something where they were going to make a decision whether
[03:01:49.040 --> 03:01:53.600]  not not to have the drill it was pretty much yeah you can come and voice your concerns and
[03:01:53.600 --> 03:01:59.360]  we'll pretty much write it in the median minutes and nothing's going to happen so uh people talked to
[03:01:59.360 --> 03:02:03.920]  said that they should have some type of recourse to cancel the drill or at least postpone it
[03:02:03.920 --> 03:02:09.600]  until uh people's fears can be alleviated well just from what i saw he was being a little bit
[03:02:09.600 --> 03:02:14.560]  smart mouth they would also try to just say ask your question they would try to poo poo it
[03:02:14.560 --> 03:02:19.200]  but i heard a lot of stuff that kernels said that we know is not true from their own paperwork
[03:02:19.200 --> 03:02:25.200]  they put out to the public yeah and i had a chance to interview them briefly just asked a couple
[03:02:25.200 --> 03:02:29.040]  questions because i approached the guy i said hey kernel can i get a quick word he said you
[03:02:29.040 --> 03:02:33.280]  get with info wars dot com i was like yeah and he said you asked me a question i'm like yeah i did
[03:02:33.280 --> 03:02:36.480]  respectfully and he was like okay well what are you going to ask me how many questions you're
[03:02:36.480 --> 03:02:39.680]  going to ask me i was like you didn't ask i think who are they talking to kx a and josh
[03:02:39.680 --> 03:02:43.920]  yeah they talked to kx a and right before i walked up and he didn't screen their question he didn't
[03:02:43.920 --> 03:02:47.680]  ask how many questions you guys want to ask me you know uh what question you're going to ask
[03:02:47.680 --> 03:02:51.600]  so i said okay how about we just asked three questions he said okay and they weren't
[03:02:51.600 --> 03:02:55.040]  i was trying to be as unredunded as possible and asking me oh just some stuff off the top
[03:02:55.040 --> 03:02:58.880]  of my head because we have plenty of stuff of him kind of dancing around questions but you know
[03:02:58.880 --> 03:03:03.440]  it's just basically a pio's answer you know alice i know you've encountered these people i have
[03:03:03.440 --> 03:03:07.920]  david as joe bigs as of course and their job is pretty much just to give you the most
[03:03:07.920 --> 03:03:12.240]  undescript answer as possible you know nothing that deviates too much from the script or from the
[03:03:12.240 --> 03:03:16.560]  q cards but you know he did come out here in the face of the firing squad and of course like most
[03:03:16.560 --> 03:03:20.480]  of the people here i respect him for his military service but i think he left the people here very
[03:03:20.480 --> 03:03:26.880]  unsatisfied in his answers well sure and he said it's about my uniform it's about me you can trust
[03:03:26.880 --> 03:03:31.920]  me as if he was the commander-in-chief as if he was the george washe said this organization's been
[03:03:31.920 --> 03:03:38.080]  around 240 years the globalists are overthrowing that organization right now and that's why they
[03:03:38.080 --> 03:03:44.160]  don't just have the portly pr guy Hubble out there anymore whatever his name is mead they now
[03:03:44.160 --> 03:03:50.320]  are rolling out the the military people hoping that that sells the public yeah that's right you
[03:03:50.320 --> 03:03:59.040]  know he's a come he's a guy he came out here he's very sharp okay but yeah he was a very well
[03:03:59.040 --> 03:04:04.320]  spoken guy and the people you know they were very respectful i thought by and large there was a
[03:04:04.320 --> 03:04:08.800]  couple of outbursts but you know the people were very respectful by and large but they just weren't
[03:04:08.800 --> 03:04:12.480]  here to answer the questions of the public they were here to reinforce the narrative
[03:04:12.480 --> 03:04:16.880]  that they also they've already stated and that's just you know it's pretty much moveable
[03:04:17.440 --> 03:04:21.760]  on there's nothing to see here and my question when i had a chance to ask the colonel during
[03:04:21.760 --> 03:04:27.520]  the meeting i asked him you know where did these roleplay from and would there be any drills to
[03:04:27.520 --> 03:04:31.600]  round up and or detain these people and at first he didn't want to answer or he kind of answered
[03:04:31.600 --> 03:04:35.280]  around about but he eventually said yes it is possibility these people could be rounded up
[03:04:35.280 --> 03:04:39.680]  during the course of the drill there you go also confirm they are going to practice round ups great
[03:04:39.680 --> 03:04:44.320]  job jacari jackson go get some lunch on the company and then we'll see you guys back here
[03:04:44.320 --> 03:04:49.120]  for the not only news tonight a roundtable discussion uh discussion uh so again that's not
