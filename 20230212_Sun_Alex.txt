[00:00.000 --> 00:28.400]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:28.400 --> 00:39.040]  And it's Sunday, February 12th, 2023, I'm your host Alex Jones, I'll be here for the
[00:39.040 --> 00:43.480]  next two hours, live, and in the great Owen Shroyle come in, 6 to 8 p.m. out of the same
[00:43.480 --> 00:47.040]  studio for Sunday, live, all-time central.
[00:47.040 --> 00:51.960]  Well, while a lot of people are having fun, and I don't blame them, watching the Chiefs
[00:51.960 --> 00:58.080]  versus the Eagles, and all of that that's going on, we're busy watching what's happening
[00:58.080 --> 01:04.360]  around the world with the New World Order, and with all these UFOs that are flying around,
[01:04.360 --> 01:09.220]  and all these shoot-downs that are happening, and taking place not just here, but reportedly
[01:09.220 --> 01:12.080]  now starting over in China as well.
[01:12.080 --> 01:13.680]  What's really behind that?
[01:13.680 --> 01:20.600]  Well, everybody from CNN to Fox News has been hyping, could it be aliens?
[01:20.600 --> 01:26.000]  Even though in every case it turns out that it's a Chinese balloon carrying different
[01:26.000 --> 01:32.360]  surveillance and or weapons packages, and this has been going on for decades, the question
[01:32.360 --> 01:37.600]  is why is it getting attention now, and that's because the Pentagon and the PSIOP experts
[01:37.600 --> 01:41.720]  want it to be getting attention now, because the United States is doing giant drills right
[01:41.720 --> 01:45.800]  off the coast of China and Taiwan, and we've never been closer to war, according to our
[01:45.800 --> 01:50.960]  own hijacked government, and of course the globalists who run Shai Kong government as
[01:50.960 --> 01:51.960]  well.
[01:51.960 --> 01:58.440]  The globalists installed, they don't run it now, that's why war is going from soft
[01:58.440 --> 01:59.680]  into hot.
[01:59.680 --> 02:05.520]  Big developments obviously over in Ukraine, I believe we're just days away from the big
[02:05.520 --> 02:11.360]  second Russian invasion that I think will happen before the one-year anniversary on
[02:11.360 --> 02:13.360]  the 24th.
[02:13.360 --> 02:19.080]  We're going to be looking at all of it here today, and I want to thank you all for tuning
[02:19.080 --> 02:24.560]  in this evening, remember, the establishment works around the clock to try to block this
[02:24.560 --> 02:29.280]  show and censor this show, so this is not a spectator sport, the Info War is about being
[02:29.280 --> 02:33.280]  the man and woman in the arena, it's very easy to be in the arena, take the live links
[02:33.280 --> 02:40.920]  for infowars.com, the live show feed from band.video, or places like conspiracyfact.info
[02:40.920 --> 02:45.560]  and share it from there and win the Info War against the New World Order.
[02:45.560 --> 02:50.320]  We've got so much to hit on the balloon situation and what I think is really behind that, what's
[02:50.320 --> 02:53.560]  behind the PsyOps coming up this evening.
[02:53.560 --> 02:56.960]  Then not just here in the U.S., but all over the world governments are admitting they've
[02:56.960 --> 03:01.920]  been covertly censoring people with big tech, U.S. State Department funding, secret information
[03:01.920 --> 03:05.880]  crusade to blacklist conservatives, we told you about that years ago, now it's come out
[03:05.880 --> 03:09.880]  in Congress, we have some amazing clips from Friday that we didn't have time to get to,
[03:09.880 --> 03:16.600]  what's happening live as we were speaking, also Elon Musk retweeted a video montage yesterday
[03:16.600 --> 03:23.080]  of myself and Joe Rogan that was used to hype up the whole alien invasion narrative that
[03:23.080 --> 03:27.680]  is taking place, what we really have is an invasion of our privacy, an invasion of our
[03:27.680 --> 03:32.920]  bodies with the poison shots and the AI surveillance grid, and what we really have is an invasion
[03:32.920 --> 03:37.200]  of third world populations starving to death because the globalists shut down their countries
[03:37.200 --> 03:41.000]  for more than two years, the West was only shut down on average for about a year, the
[03:41.000 --> 03:45.200]  U.S. only for about six months, but fully shut down, but we're going to be looking at
[03:45.200 --> 03:51.240]  all of that today as well plus the exploding crime rate thanks to Democrats defunding the
[03:51.240 --> 03:56.560]  police and telling police to slow roll, massive news on the whole poison shot front, we knew
[03:56.560 --> 04:02.600]  this was coming and whether it's people like the dictator of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez or
[04:02.600 --> 04:10.800]  now Socialist President Lula De Silva, they're announcing forced injections of Pfizer shots,
[04:10.800 --> 04:16.560]  Communist always closely allied with Big Pharma for anyone that wants to ever have access
[04:16.560 --> 04:22.080]  to healthcare or any type of financial aid or support, and of course they're saying your
[04:22.080 --> 04:25.480]  children can't go to school if you don't take it, so that's what they want to bring us here,
[04:25.480 --> 04:30.480]  they're already trying it all around the world, real tyranny and there's been some new hearings
[04:30.480 --> 04:35.480]  with other top experts in the death actuary field confirming the trend we've seen over
[04:35.480 --> 04:42.280]  two years accelerating a massive increase in death of 150 plus percent on the first
[04:42.280 --> 04:48.920]  shot alone, we've got all that, that's only a small window into what is coming up today,
[04:48.920 --> 04:52.840]  Hillary Clinton's giving a speech calling for banning cash, bringing cash with society
[04:52.840 --> 05:01.720]  and so much more, tomorrow's news today, thanks for joining us on Super Bowl Sunday.
[05:01.720 --> 05:06.440]  I talk a lot about the great successes Info Wars has had, I don't think anybody can deny
[05:06.440 --> 05:11.960]  it, and it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us, but when we talk about the
[05:11.960 --> 05:16.880]  crew at Info Wars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really
[05:16.880 --> 05:22.080]  have been the MVPs in this fight, and when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer
[05:22.080 --> 05:27.240]  and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really
[05:27.240 --> 05:28.240]  just incredible.
[05:28.240 --> 05:33.200]  So for myself, the whole Info Wars crew, I thank you for your past support, I only encourage
[05:33.200 --> 05:38.280]  you now to realize that Info Wars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[05:38.280 --> 05:41.480]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us and that's wonderful, keep doing it,
[05:41.480 --> 05:46.760]  but most viewers and listeners never go to infowarstore.com and you never buy great products
[05:46.760 --> 05:50.600]  that enrich and empower your life, all at the same time, keep us on air, I know that
[05:50.600 --> 05:54.840]  less than one percent of our listeners actually go buy products at infowarstore.com, if just
[05:54.840 --> 05:58.880]  one percent more of you took action and went to infowarstore.com, our funding problems will
[05:58.880 --> 06:01.880]  be over, please take action now.
[06:01.880 --> 06:17.280]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of
[06:17.280 --> 06:26.480]  the Info War.
[06:26.480 --> 06:34.400]  So there is a steady stream of Chinese Communist balloons coming in, again as I told you, over
[06:34.400 --> 06:40.560]  the North Pole, down over Alaska into Western Canada, and on Friday and then again on Saturday,
[06:40.560 --> 06:47.840]  the United States shot down using F-22 Raptors, two of those unidentified flying objects which
[06:47.840 --> 06:54.400]  they now admit were balloons, they report that the avionics of the Sidewinder missiles
[06:54.400 --> 07:00.480]  were affected by what was on board, showing these things have pretty sophisticated jamming
[07:00.480 --> 07:06.320]  on them if you believe what we're hearing out of the Pentagon, they lie so much, who
[07:06.320 --> 07:10.880]  knows, like telling the troops the vaccine was tested to safe, it was all a damn lie,
[07:10.880 --> 07:14.920]  I don't dislike the troops, I love the troops, and the folks in the military, but some of
[07:14.920 --> 07:18.440]  the best people in the country, but the folks running it are the enemies of the nation,
[07:18.440 --> 07:22.280]  that's how you bring a country down, is the enemies from within.
[07:22.280 --> 07:29.400]  So everywhere, Fox News, CNN, all of them have been hyping, is this an alien invasion?
[07:29.400 --> 07:33.880]  Even though by the end of Friday night, Pentagon said it was another balloon, and by the end
[07:33.880 --> 07:38.200]  of Saturday night, the second one, okay, it was another balloon of some type, these much
[07:38.200 --> 07:45.360]  smaller than the gigantic one that was shot down last week, and the media is just all
[07:45.360 --> 07:51.680]  over the place on this, Project Bluebeam activated question mark, no all about the conspiracy
[07:51.680 --> 07:56.640]  theory going viral again after sightings of UFOs, that just means unidentified, so you
[07:56.640 --> 08:02.000]  know what it is, I mean if a jet's flying at 50,000 feet, they see it on radar until
[08:02.000 --> 08:08.320]  they visualize it, it doesn't have transponders, they say it's unidentified, it's just unidentified.
[08:08.320 --> 08:14.600]  Going viral again after sightings of UFOs in the US, Canada, and China, and so now as
[08:14.600 --> 08:20.320]  the US and China move more into a war stance with each other, both in rhetoric and with
[08:20.320 --> 08:26.480]  military forces, this is a way to saber rattle further, and then meanwhile have the corporate
[08:26.480 --> 08:34.720]  media tell you it might be little green men, here's the newsweek's headline, alien invasions,
[08:34.720 --> 08:41.600]  congressman addresses speculation after UFOs shot down, UFOs are being shot down left and
[08:41.600 --> 08:50.600]  right, and the internet thinks an alien attack is imminent, another suspected flying something
[08:50.600 --> 08:57.480]  goes down near Alaska, I missed the possible alien invasion, Biden undermines all his prior
[08:57.480 --> 09:09.800]  statements, and so that's red state and town hall and CNN and all of them, a day after,
[09:09.800 --> 09:13.760]  and in the case of Friday shooting down two days after, the Pentagon admits they were
[09:13.760 --> 09:18.640]  balloons and have been recovering with debris, they don't care, they just keep saying UFO,
[09:18.640 --> 09:26.080]  UFO, UFO, the public thinks UFO means an alien, no it just means unidentified, China now
[09:26.080 --> 09:31.760]  claiming it has also intercepted a UFO off their coast, here's what we know about the
[09:31.760 --> 09:37.880]  unidentified objects shot down over North America, CNN, baffled pilots who shot down
[09:37.880 --> 09:44.600]  mystery objects say it interfered with their sensors, US jet shoots down unidentified objects
[09:44.600 --> 09:49.880]  over Northern Canada, China scrambles fighter jets to shoot down unidentified objects over
[09:49.880 --> 09:55.160]  its airspace, nor add to Claire's false alarm of a mysterious airborne object over Montana,
[09:55.160 --> 10:01.200]  after congressman said DOD was waiting till morning to get eyes on it, that's another
[10:01.200 --> 10:05.760]  one they're saying, there's gonna be three if that's true, scientist alien concern after
[10:05.760 --> 10:13.600]  finding space objects sending signals to Earth, that's out of the daily star in the UK, scientists
[10:13.600 --> 10:18.840]  became concerned when she thought signals were being sent to Earth with space being sent
[10:18.840 --> 10:26.960]  by aliens that goes on from there, of course it was just another deep space satellite,
[10:26.960 --> 10:31.240]  there are tens of thousands of different satellites that have been launched since the 60s, they're
[10:31.240 --> 10:39.320]  all over the place, and I liken a satellite to a neighbor you've got a quarter mile away
[10:39.320 --> 10:45.880]  who's got a big powerful telescope on their deck, and if you've got a telescope like that,
[10:45.880 --> 10:48.600]  they're incredible, in fact I have one, it's the stores where I have time to use it, bought
[10:48.600 --> 10:53.360]  it back in college, and the stars are cool to look at with it, the planets are neat,
[10:53.360 --> 10:57.760]  you've got to be in really clear sky to do that as we drive out to the hill cutter, sometimes
[10:57.760 --> 11:01.920]  me and my dad and I was in college and stay up all night out there drinking a couple beers
[11:01.920 --> 11:07.800]  and eating sandwiches and looking at the planets and things, but what telescopes are amazing
[11:07.800 --> 11:14.120]  for is up close and down on the ground, and you never really watch your neighbors, that's
[11:14.120 --> 11:21.760]  not fun to do, but all people do is watch TV, but the geckos on the lamp post and the ants
[11:21.760 --> 11:31.080]  going across the windowsill and the possum digging in the trash can or the bobcat climbing
[11:31.080 --> 11:40.960]  on the roof, that's what telescopes are amazing for at night, and liken a satellite up there
[11:40.960 --> 11:45.080]  shooting down on a clear day, it can read back in the sixties they could, the date on
[11:45.080 --> 11:49.480]  a penny or a dime, it can read what a woman laying in Central Park, famous photos of this
[11:49.480 --> 11:54.760]  from the late sixties, what she's reading, the text on a little paperback she's reading,
[11:54.760 --> 11:59.800]  but what balloons are for obviously is to get a brighter reading with ground penetrating
[11:59.800 --> 12:05.520]  radar or laser scans like we just saw over Hawaii a few days ago and the Pentagon says
[12:05.520 --> 12:13.680]  it's a Chinese satellite, that's very, very serious, but again this whole angle that it's
[12:13.680 --> 12:18.600]  aliens is just preposterous, but people don't get upset about their neighbor a half mile
[12:18.600 --> 12:22.320]  away looking at them through a telescope because they're usually not even aware of it, they
[12:22.320 --> 12:32.600]  can't see it unless they've got a telescope, but imagine you're sitting there in bed and
[12:32.600 --> 12:38.560]  you're just getting into bed, you turn your lights out and then you look over at the blinds
[12:38.560 --> 12:43.960]  and there's a dude standing looking through your window, you get very, very upset, you
[12:43.960 --> 12:49.360]  get very, very angry, somebody is in your territory and you should, for anybody that's
[12:49.360 --> 12:53.920]  ever happened to, it's horrifying, or you're sitting there watching TV and suddenly here's
[12:53.920 --> 12:56.960]  somebody trying to break into your rocks, that happened once to me, never a peeping
[12:56.960 --> 13:05.480]  tom and that's why people are so upset, that's why they're angry is because it's like having
[13:05.480 --> 13:10.360]  somebody up against your window looking at you versus looking at you from a quarter or
[13:10.360 --> 13:15.600]  half mile away and the Pentagon is exacerbating this, you know it does turn out that a bunch
[13:15.600 --> 13:20.240]  of these balloons came over when Trump was in office and General Milley, the trader,
[13:20.240 --> 13:26.400]  the globalist, the critical race theory pusher and others decided not to tell him, well that's
[13:26.400 --> 13:30.000]  a felony when it's their job to tell him he didn't, but they didn't want Trump to look
[13:30.000 --> 13:35.200]  good telling China not to do it or shoot him down, instead they just continued it, but
[13:35.200 --> 13:40.000]  now they want to embarrass Biden, he's supposed to not run again, he's supposed to go away
[13:40.000 --> 13:43.560]  so they're bringing out the Hunter Biden laptop after the election, they're bringing out all
[13:43.560 --> 13:47.440]  the other corruption issues, the fact that he has dementia and that he didn't shoot
[13:47.440 --> 13:51.880]  the balloon down, he finally woke up before they could really set him up because they
[13:51.880 --> 13:56.960]  want him gone and shot one down and now he thinks he's the president so he ordered him,
[13:56.960 --> 14:03.560]  you will be court-martialed, I'll have you removed if you don't shoot that next one down,
[14:03.560 --> 14:07.280]  so now they've got all the fighter planes right there where they come in over the North
[14:07.280 --> 14:11.880]  Pole, over Alaska, into Canada on a flight path, they could come in right over the North
[14:11.880 --> 14:15.680]  Pole and come right down over Minnesota or come right in over Michigan or come right
[14:15.680 --> 14:20.840]  in over Maine, but no, they want to do a whole flight path across the U.S. so they come in,
[14:20.840 --> 14:24.960]  they launch them over the North Pole, they come on down on the western side, come right
[14:24.960 --> 14:28.440]  down Alaska, right down across the middle of the United States and that's the answer
[14:28.440 --> 14:31.960]  and that's what it is, with a nice bow on it, I don't think anybody can disagree with
[14:31.960 --> 14:32.960]  me.
[14:32.960 --> 14:33.960]  Now what can these big balloons do?
[14:33.960 --> 14:38.640]  I mean he keeps saying the big one they shot down last week was as long as three school
[14:38.640 --> 14:44.800]  buses, no, it was much bigger than that, that's what was hanging off the bottom, it was gigantic
[14:44.800 --> 14:48.920]  and I can tell you the U.S. has stuff even bigger which they've admitted to, they're
[14:48.920 --> 14:56.760]  blimps and so this thing would be the perfect thing to again, ground scanning, reading radar
[14:56.760 --> 15:02.280]  to get real topography lists but also to carry an EMP bomb or something else and that's
[15:02.280 --> 15:06.240]  why it is a serious situation when Biden tried to spend it at first and said it was no big
[15:06.240 --> 15:11.080]  deal, then he saw the poll numbers or his people did and said this is a little too far
[15:11.080 --> 15:16.440]  so that's what's scary about Biden is he has very few loyal people around him, they all
[15:16.440 --> 15:21.800]  work for Obama and now they're going to continue to set him up to make him step down which
[15:21.800 --> 15:27.600]  makes the U.S. look even weaker to the world, an even bigger joke as the deep state plays
[15:27.600 --> 15:32.280]  politics with the puppet they protected that they censored for, they surveilled for, that
[15:32.280 --> 15:36.480]  they harassed people for, they've imprisoned people for and then they put him in and now
[15:36.480 --> 15:42.520]  they want to get rid of him and now they cause this incredibly dangerous destabilization
[15:42.520 --> 15:48.200]  move while we're basically at war with Russia so that's the news on the blimp, I'm going
[15:48.200 --> 15:53.480]  to come back and hit massive news on euthanasia being pushed not just in Canada but around
[15:53.480 --> 16:03.360]  the world and so much more, please stay with us, I talk about the great successes Info
[16:03.360 --> 16:08.920]  Wars has had, I don't think anybody can deny it and it is because of listeners and viewers
[16:08.920 --> 16:13.240]  supporting us, when we talk about the crew at Info Wars, people behind the scenes, the
[16:13.240 --> 16:19.720]  researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight and we look at
[16:19.720 --> 16:24.680]  Harrison Smith and Owen Schreuer and the hard work they engage in every day five, six, seven
[16:24.680 --> 16:29.720]  days a week, it's really just incredible, so for myself and the whole Info Wars crew
[16:29.720 --> 16:34.840]  I thank you for your past support, I only encourage you now to realize that Info Wars
[16:34.840 --> 16:38.760]  can not stay on air if you do not support us, I know you spread the word, I know you
[16:38.760 --> 16:42.920]  pray for us and that's wonderful, keep doing it but most viewers and listeners never go
[16:42.920 --> 16:47.600]  to InfoWarsTour.com and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life
[16:47.600 --> 16:51.320]  all at the same time, keep us on air, I know that less than one percent of our listeners
[16:51.320 --> 16:55.840]  actually go buy products at InfoWarsTour.com, if just one percent more of you took action
[16:55.840 --> 17:00.000]  at InfoWarsTour.com, our funding problems will be over, please take action now.
[17:00.000 --> 17:04.440]  Info Wars is winning, Info Wars is reaching more people than ever, we were supposed to
[17:04.440 --> 17:08.560]  be off the air months and months and months ago, mainstream media told you but it's not
[17:08.560 --> 17:12.520]  true, they told you we were going to be shut down, they told you we owed a billion and
[17:12.520 --> 17:16.600]  a half dollars, none of that's true, it's all being appealed, they want you to think
[17:16.600 --> 17:21.440]  Info Wars is dead but if you simply stand up and support Info Wars, we've got years
[17:21.440 --> 17:26.240]  and years of appeals and we will not be taken off the air but if they can convince you that
[17:26.240 --> 17:30.280]  we've been shut down, they're going to win, don't let the globalist Psyop you and your
[17:30.280 --> 17:35.520]  family, go to InfoWarsTour.com and get incredible products, supplements, books, films, t-shirts,
[17:35.520 --> 17:39.600]  you name it, they fund the Info War and empower your life and let the globalist know their
[17:39.600 --> 17:46.240]  Psyop has not worked, thanks for keeping us on air, take action at InfoWarsTour.com
[17:46.240 --> 17:50.840]  today because the only people who can take us off the air is you, the viewers and listeners,
[17:50.840 --> 17:55.640]  the majority of you have not been Psyop, but some of you have, do not let the globalist
[17:55.640 --> 17:59.920]  brainwash you, go to InfoWarsTour.com and keep us on the air.
[17:59.920 --> 18:04.960]  If you go to onlinehealthnow.com, connect with trusted and unbiased doctors at the wellness
[18:04.960 --> 18:05.960]  company.
[18:05.960 --> 18:10.000]  And I tell you I'm honored to be the chief scientific officer of the company, I contribute
[18:10.000 --> 18:16.200]  with like so many else do there, so many wonderful doctors, far and away the most popular product
[18:16.200 --> 18:22.960]  is Dr. Vandewater's detoxification supplement that features natokinase, it's a natural proteolytic
[18:22.960 --> 18:28.840]  enzyme, this one is the only enzyme that we're aware of right now that dissolves the spike
[18:28.840 --> 18:33.280]  protein, this is very important, the spike protein is loaded in the body with the COVID-19
[18:33.280 --> 18:36.840]  infection and definitely with the vaccines, people are lower with the spike protein they
[18:36.840 --> 18:42.560]  don't feel well, this is a potential solution, hydroxychloroquine comes from a natural substance,
[18:42.560 --> 18:48.480]  so does ivermectin and now natokinase, isn't it interesting, natural substances in a sense
[18:48.480 --> 18:53.200]  combating this man-made disaster, SARS-CoV-2 in the vaccines.
[18:53.200 --> 18:56.920]  Onlinehealthnow.com, thank you for your support and thank you for getting into that because
[18:56.920 --> 18:59.640]  it's important, you didn't come here to do that but I made you do it.
[18:59.640 --> 19:05.800]  There is a war on for your mind, your mind is a battlefield, this is an information war,
[19:05.800 --> 19:11.600]  InfoWars popularized those terms more than two decades ago and today whether it's Donald
[19:11.600 --> 19:18.360]  Trump or Governor DeSantis or Dr. Robert Malone, they're all using the terms that InfoWars
[19:18.360 --> 19:22.560]  has popularized because we understand the enemy's operations and we know how to beat
[19:22.560 --> 19:27.120]  them but we can't do it without funding and we make it easy to fund with great products
[19:27.120 --> 19:31.160]  and power you and your immune system and your family as well, you can also make straight
[19:31.160 --> 19:36.040]  donations at InfoWars.com, clicking on the big red banner, a one-time recurring but I'm
[19:36.040 --> 19:40.240]  asking you to take action, we're non-violent but every time you donate money, every time
[19:40.240 --> 19:44.240]  you buy products, every time you keep us on air, you are literally non-violently politically
[19:44.240 --> 19:49.080]  punching the New World Order in the nose, punching their lies in the nose.
[19:49.080 --> 19:52.600]  We are going to defeat the New World Order, we're going over the top, right now is the
[19:52.600 --> 20:01.440]  critical juncture, so please go to InfoWars.com and donate now.
[20:01.440 --> 20:28.960]  Using a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:28.960 --> 20:47.120]  The world is being taken into a transition, a transhumanist transition, the end of all
[20:47.120 --> 20:52.920]  life forms as we know it and the rise of a scientifically directed forced evolutionary
[20:52.920 --> 20:59.540]  system beyond terraforming just the atmosphere, but terraforming the very genetics of the
[20:59.540 --> 21:05.360]  planet itself, welcome to the scientific dictatorship that is the New World Order and
[21:05.360 --> 21:11.720]  its program of the great reset to build back better on our ashes and that's where I wanted
[21:11.720 --> 21:17.360]  to go with this.
[21:17.360 --> 21:23.880]  They took an epic four hour episode, the biggest podcast Joe Rogan ever did, he's now officially
[21:23.880 --> 21:28.720]  eclipsed the former biggest one, Elon Musk, his first interview with him.
[21:28.720 --> 21:33.720]  My second podcast with Rogan like four years ago, and I didn't want to suggest many times
[21:33.720 --> 21:37.760]  but on other shows he was doing many times but not his official podcast, the second time
[21:37.760 --> 21:44.520]  I was on there and he asked about aliens and I explained to him that these laboratories,
[21:44.520 --> 21:51.560]  both government and private, are making aliens, not just mixing plants and animals and fish
[21:51.560 --> 21:56.600]  with insects and just thousands of different kind of heroes, humanized mice, they had 30
[21:56.600 --> 22:00.840]  years ago, the list goes on and on, they told you Dolly the sheep was the first clone back
[22:00.840 --> 22:05.480]  in the early 90s, that was a big lie, in fact that was easily verified as a lie, it was in
[22:05.480 --> 22:12.400]  the main line literature that the Nazis were cloning rabbits, so examples of this go on
[22:12.400 --> 22:19.160]  and on and I said so they're making alien life forms here in the lab and it was shortly
[22:19.160 --> 22:23.960]  after that even MIT had headlines about alien life forms are being made and if you look
[22:23.960 --> 22:31.000]  at some of the synthetic nanotech viruses they're making, they have no origin in a natural
[22:31.000 --> 22:38.160]  virus, they're completely made in laboratories using different chemicals and different complex
[22:38.160 --> 22:43.680]  compounds, use the building blocks of life but don't use any of the actual main parts
[22:43.680 --> 22:51.120]  of it that are completely new and alien to the planet, so alien simply means not of this
[22:51.120 --> 22:59.080]  world, not of the natural line of this world, they can make new creatures and so I explained
[22:59.080 --> 23:04.240]  that, that was one form of alien and that if they create an artificial AI that thinks
[23:04.240 --> 23:09.400]  it's conscious, whether it's conscious or not, that's a new quote life form on this
[23:09.400 --> 23:14.440]  planet and then interdimensionally when people take DMT and other drugs you can have 30 people
[23:14.440 --> 23:18.360]  together, they do these ceremonies and the government's done these tests where in many
[23:18.360 --> 23:22.320]  cases they will all see the same entities at the same time, so you're not having your
[23:22.320 --> 23:26.120]  own individual hallucination, it's lifting the veil that the Bible talks about, people
[23:26.120 --> 23:31.840]  are actually seeing other dimensions and it can be transmissions, recordings of different
[23:31.840 --> 23:36.880]  times, fold space, there's a lot of different mathematical theories that predicted this
[23:36.880 --> 23:42.840]  over 130 years ago that they're now manifesting but they took like a 30 minute rant from
[23:42.840 --> 23:46.840]  that 4 hour show and edited it down to a minute and a half and it's got millions and millions
[23:46.840 --> 23:52.360]  of views, it's all over the place, it just broke last night, the video's on infowars.com,
[23:52.360 --> 23:57.520]  Elon Musk retweets hilarious video of Alex Jones and Joe Rogan discussing space aliens
[23:57.520 --> 24:02.120]  and what's funny is people are watching this video on Twitter and Elon Musk retweeted it
[24:02.120 --> 24:07.000]  and they think it's not edited, they think this is really going on, when it's a mashup
[24:07.000 --> 24:13.520]  to basically turn the very serious topic, I was talking about into a joke, here it is.
[24:13.520 --> 24:17.680]  Where do you think the contact with the aliens came from, when did that start?
[24:17.680 --> 24:21.960]  You know, I'm not going to get into it, I need to hear about aliens, I know you already
[24:21.960 --> 24:22.960]  know all this show.
[24:22.960 --> 24:26.680]  Hold on a second, but I want to ask you, just because I don't know.
[24:26.680 --> 24:30.880]  Oh yeah right, we're in contact with aliens, here's what's happening, because it's not
[24:30.880 --> 24:35.160]  just one group of aliens, it's two different groups, a big five, okay tell me what's going
[24:35.160 --> 24:36.160]  on.
[24:36.160 --> 24:39.440]  Let me begin, I'm telling you Joe, this is a real deal, we're listening to you.
[24:39.440 --> 24:43.520]  Well first off, elves is the main group, okay, and they call me elves, clockwork elves,
[24:43.520 --> 24:44.880]  I don't think you'll have to say that anymore.
[24:44.880 --> 24:48.120]  There are bad things that look like elves that have horns, when they show you who they
[24:48.120 --> 24:54.640]  really are, they're bad aliens, I'm with you, AI is alien, like a robot, they're like robots
[24:54.640 --> 24:55.640]  coming to kill you.
[24:55.640 --> 24:56.640]  That's Christ.
[24:56.640 --> 24:58.000]  The Chimeras are alien.
[24:58.000 --> 25:02.560]  And there's a hive mind sort of thinking to a lot of this.
[25:02.560 --> 25:06.240]  They want the organs, I swear I'm a kid that's always the truth about that, I believe you,
[25:06.240 --> 25:10.680]  I believe you, they're coming after everybody, it's a break away civilization dude, we don't
[25:10.680 --> 25:11.680]  know what they got.
[25:11.680 --> 25:16.040]  Joe, they're control freaks, that's why I'm so glad you're in the fight now, these guys
[25:16.040 --> 25:20.480]  are on stuff that like nobody even knows, what do you think they're on, stuff they've
[25:20.480 --> 25:21.480]  been given.
[25:21.480 --> 25:24.680]  Okay, I understand what you're saying, there's like armed guys and machine guys, that is
[25:24.680 --> 25:28.120]  a group of people that were obsessed with combat.
[25:28.120 --> 25:29.760]  About the most fearless killers there are.
[25:29.760 --> 25:31.600]  Do you think that's from the heritage of war?
[25:31.600 --> 25:34.200]  I mean, it's just like, it's been a long list man.
[25:34.200 --> 25:35.200]  Yep.
[25:35.200 --> 25:36.200]  That's a fact.
[25:36.200 --> 25:43.400]  Now, one of the other types of aliens that the globalist openly in their white papers
[25:43.400 --> 25:49.520]  talk about, and Elon must be aware of AI gods, is what Google when it first got CIA funding
[25:49.520 --> 25:59.520]  in 1998, was officially founded in 99, with Schmidt and the rest of them, Sergey Brin,
[25:59.520 --> 26:06.240]  Larry Page, in their original prospectus to investors, Incutel and the CIA look it up,
[26:06.240 --> 26:10.720]  they said we want to create a live time system with billions of nodes, then trillions of
[26:10.720 --> 26:14.880]  nodes in all the devices everywhere, and they get humans to wear headsets and interface
[26:14.880 --> 26:19.840]  with it, so that the hive mind of humans will be interface with that, and we will then declare
[26:19.840 --> 26:26.240]  that this merger of humans in live time, giving data information to the supercomputer will
[26:26.240 --> 26:32.440]  be a super brain, or a group collective consciousness, and if you have billions of people at one
[26:32.440 --> 26:39.720]  time logged into Google, talking to Google, AI scanning it, chatbots, all these systems
[26:39.720 --> 26:44.840]  integrated together, recording everything you're doing, using you as a sensor, using
[26:44.840 --> 26:50.360]  the billions of cameras and ring systems as sensors, they are calling that because it's
[26:50.360 --> 26:56.240]  interfacing with billions of intelligences, and with conscious beings, that interface
[26:56.240 --> 27:02.200]  they say they believe would be the first true AI that really would be conscious, but only
[27:02.200 --> 27:07.240]  because it's jacked in to not just billions of neurons like you have in your brain, but
[27:07.240 --> 27:13.600]  each one of us as a neuron in that group collective brain, and that's what I told Joe, but you
[27:13.600 --> 27:17.760]  notice they edited that piece, Joe didn't, some interesting group on the internet, they
[27:17.760 --> 27:20.560]  don't even know who they are, there's so many great artists out there, but they did it,
[27:20.560 --> 27:25.240]  they're gonna ridicule me at the end, and oh, it's mental illness, and then they go,
[27:25.240 --> 27:29.680]  Joe goes absolutely it is, and that's why Elon put it out there, it's kind of a back
[27:29.680 --> 27:35.160]  slap, but meanwhile when Elon went on Joe's show about a month after I was on that time,
[27:35.160 --> 27:38.520]  he agreed that it's interdimensional and that there's multi-dimensions in the dark
[27:38.520 --> 27:43.320]  matter that's at least five times more magnetically strong and is bleeding into ours and that
[27:43.320 --> 27:48.000]  there basically are people interfacing with this, and so when I tell you all this, this
[27:48.000 --> 27:51.520]  is what the establishment believes, this is what they're studying, this is what they're
[27:51.520 --> 27:57.680]  doing, and we've talked about it at Nauseum, but I just thought that was very, very interesting
[27:57.680 --> 28:03.680]  that now this is all coming out, they kind of used an edited video of myself to create
[28:03.680 --> 28:10.280]  more energy in the background chatter and ambient noise that we're having aliens invade
[28:10.280 --> 28:15.120]  right now when they're really just balloons and blimps.
[28:15.120 --> 28:19.800]  So I've hit that now, I said I'd get into euthanasia and dehumanization that ties directly
[28:19.800 --> 28:26.320]  into this, I will do that when we come back, and then the next layer of censorship and
[28:26.320 --> 28:31.280]  some of the incredible stuff that happened in this week's hearings where the illegal
[28:31.280 --> 28:36.000]  government surveillance and spying on the people came out, very, very powerful information
[28:36.000 --> 28:41.760]  and we have the latest on moves worldwide by Pfizer and Moderna to make governments bring
[28:41.760 --> 28:45.440]  back forced injections, it's happening in Brazil, and other areas we're going to hit
[28:45.440 --> 28:53.160]  with that, we've got a lot of information on the economy and more tonight, Hillary wants

[30:00.920 --> 30:08.400]  I have been in a 28 year marathon battle with a globalist, I have come from nowhere to the
[30:08.400 --> 30:14.280]  very heights of politics, not just in America but in the world, we are engaging the globalist
[30:14.280 --> 30:19.680]  at point-blank range in the information war, but I don't deserve the credit, yes I've
[30:19.680 --> 30:24.680]  persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support M4Words for the real reason you've
[30:24.680 --> 30:30.440]  had the success, we're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new order
[30:30.440 --> 30:37.880]  you've ever had, we are now entering the final mile of the marathon and that's why today
[30:37.880 --> 30:41.400]  it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and
[30:41.400 --> 30:45.360]  to continue in the efforts you've been tearing out and to intensify them.
[30:45.360 --> 30:51.000]  God bless you all, I salute you, I thank you and I beg you to intensify what you're doing
[30:51.000 --> 30:54.880]  now because we are over the target and this victory is happening.
[30:54.880 --> 30:59.600]  The fight is my fight, it's your fight, it's our fight, God bless you all.
[30:59.600 --> 31:06.640]  In the year 2000, Alex Jones' film Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove showed the world how
[31:06.640 --> 31:12.640]  our so-called elite leaders practice mock ritual sacrifices in private.
[31:12.640 --> 31:21.480]  In 2007, Alex Jones releases Endgame, exposing the world elites' plans for covertly using
[31:21.480 --> 31:27.160]  biological weapons against all of mankind and by the time they launched their attack
[31:27.160 --> 31:34.240]  in 2020, Alex Jones' Infowars and our audience were there to warn the people of the deadly
[31:34.240 --> 31:37.120]  vaccines that we knew were coming.
[31:37.120 --> 31:41.760]  This is why they attack us, this is why we need your support.
[31:41.760 --> 31:45.760]  Because we tell the truth, Alex Jones was right.
[31:45.760 --> 31:52.080]  Join the resistance, buy products, donate to the cause, share the links, join us in
[31:52.080 --> 31:59.520]  the fight for freedom and help us defeat the New World Order.

[33:24.600 --> 33:33.680]  And I can't even keep track of all the great fans out there making videos that are going
[33:33.680 --> 33:34.680]  viral.
[33:34.680 --> 33:38.640]  Here's one that's already gotten millions of views that I just saw on Friday.
[33:38.640 --> 33:43.040]  It's hilarious, especially if you're a TV viewer, here it is.
[33:43.040 --> 33:47.360]  Everybody we have on is fighting with everything they've got.
[33:47.360 --> 33:51.480]  This is a war against you and your family of inflation and collapse.
[33:51.480 --> 33:55.520]  So when you keep us in the fight, you keep yourself in the fight, and this is life and
[33:55.520 --> 33:56.520]  death.

[33:59.600 --> 34:03.680]  continued support, make a donation at the time, because he's a gladiator and a champion
[34:03.680 --> 34:06.680]  in the fight and if you don't support us, you're helping the enemy.
[34:06.680 --> 34:10.760]  And I'm not bitching at Lester's, I'm telling you, this is all out war.
[34:10.760 --> 34:13.600]  Yay, thank you so much for coming to Austin.
[34:13.600 --> 34:16.840]  Thank you, thanks for having me.
[34:16.840 --> 34:20.640]  That is some really super HD stuff right there.
[34:20.640 --> 34:25.040]  Great job, the folks that made that.
[34:25.040 --> 34:29.120]  By the way, our supplements really are the best, it's how we stay on air.
[34:29.120 --> 34:35.480]  It is not a gimmick that I'm over a week late in launching the new specials, but I have
[34:35.480 --> 34:39.440]  been so busy with other issues that we have not launched new specials.
[34:39.440 --> 34:43.080]  And that means good deals for you, because I was going to take most of these products
[34:43.080 --> 34:47.560]  off sale because it's months and months the more come in and then sell them at 25% off
[34:47.560 --> 34:52.440]  or 10% off instead of 50% off.
[34:52.440 --> 34:55.360]  But I haven't gotten in the meetings and looked at what we have and some of the new stuff
[34:55.360 --> 34:56.920]  that's coming in.
[34:56.920 --> 35:03.200]  And so we're just keeping the sale going, but I've got to end the sale tomorrow, but
[35:03.200 --> 35:06.800]  I haven't done it in over a week, so who knows if I will, it keeps us on air, plus
[35:06.800 --> 35:07.800]  you get a great deal.
[35:07.800 --> 35:10.000]  I would take advantage of this now because it's got to end at some point.
[35:10.000 --> 35:15.160]  In fact, some of these things have been pulled off because they have basically sold out.
[35:15.160 --> 35:17.640]  Well, not basically, they have.
[35:17.640 --> 35:22.960]  We've got 1100 milligrams of the highest quality organic vitamin C from rosey eps, the Nobel
[35:22.960 --> 35:27.120]  Prize winner, Linus Pauling, said was the best form of it in his view with a high dose
[35:27.120 --> 35:28.800]  of high quality zinc.
[35:28.800 --> 35:29.800]  That's ending soon.
[35:29.800 --> 35:32.000]  Everybody should be taking that, whether you're a man, woman, or child.

[36:33.840 --> 36:37.000]  No one to thank you all for your continued support.
[36:37.000 --> 36:38.000]  Okay.
[36:38.000 --> 36:41.680]  Let's talk about why they're doing all this.
[36:41.680 --> 36:42.680]  And I know the listeners know this.
[36:42.680 --> 36:44.080]  We have new listeners all the time tuning in.
[36:44.080 --> 36:47.080]  So I'm going to cover why they're doing it because we're here to warn new people.
[36:47.080 --> 36:49.000]  That's the most important mission, remember.
[36:49.000 --> 36:51.680]  And then we'll hit all the new news that's unfolding.
[36:51.680 --> 36:55.000]  All of the destabilization of society and the liquidation of borders, the evaluation
[36:55.000 --> 37:00.840]  of currencies, the attack on family, all of this in the words of Paul Erlich, who is the
[37:00.840 --> 37:06.440]  grand poobaw, he's still alive, of the modern eugenics, Bill Gates says is his guru, is
[37:06.440 --> 37:12.240]  to destroy families to make them untenable to reduce population and to make those that
[37:12.240 --> 37:15.320]  are left easily controllable.
[37:15.320 --> 37:19.680]  And of course, to make you not stand up for others, so they won't stand up for you.
[37:19.680 --> 37:21.880]  And so you won't even stand up for yourself.
[37:21.880 --> 37:27.600]  Before I hit this news, here's the example or the analogy.
[37:27.600 --> 37:30.680]  If you walk out in your front yard in the morning and are getting in the car going to
[37:30.680 --> 37:35.840]  work and you smell really powerful gas, you're going to run around your house and check your
[37:35.840 --> 37:38.120]  gas meter and check what's coming from there.
[37:38.120 --> 37:40.960]  You're going to follow the smell.
[37:40.960 --> 37:44.680]  This has happened to me, it's probably happened to a lot of you, to your neighbor's house
[37:44.680 --> 37:51.360]  and nobody's there, but you can hear the leak coming out of the ground in the case I saw
[37:51.360 --> 37:55.720]  right by the meter and it's really strong and that's a big danger.
[37:55.720 --> 38:00.120]  If somebody could start their car or anything and it could blow up not just their house
[38:00.120 --> 38:01.120]  but your house.
[38:01.120 --> 38:04.760]  You see these gas explosions, one happens every couple of days in the U.S., sometimes
[38:04.760 --> 38:08.200]  the family's home and everybody dies.
[38:08.200 --> 38:10.400]  So that's going on.
[38:10.400 --> 38:14.160]  And you go knock on your neighbor's door and Bob's not there.
[38:14.160 --> 38:17.680]  Well you got Bob's number, you go in the house and check by the refrigerator where you got
[38:17.680 --> 38:22.560]  the neighbor's number written down and you're calling at work and you say, hey Bob, you
[38:22.560 --> 38:26.720]  got a big gas leak, okay great, great, I'm going to come home and fix it or I'm going
[38:26.720 --> 38:30.280]  to come home and call the city right now, thank you.
[38:30.280 --> 38:35.600]  Now you're not a hero because you did that.
[38:35.600 --> 38:38.920]  I've got a little pool at my house about six months ago.
[38:38.920 --> 38:44.640]  The lawn care guys come to the door, I'm already at work, tell my wife, hey you got a gas leak
[38:44.640 --> 38:45.640]  right here.
[38:45.640 --> 38:49.200]  She calls the pool company, they get out there, they go boy it's a good thing we got here,
[38:49.200 --> 38:53.240]  this pipe on your old heater, it's an old system, I got a new heater, had rotted through
[38:53.240 --> 38:59.480]  and gas was just shooting out and if somebody would have tripped the heater on it for the
[38:59.480 --> 39:04.240]  hot tub of the pool, it could have blown the house up, that just happened five or six months
[39:04.240 --> 39:07.600]  ago, we had to pay for a new heater and all that crap.
[39:07.600 --> 39:12.360]  But what I'm getting in here is, it's not heroic that the yard guys came to the door
[39:12.360 --> 39:18.080]  mulling the yard, the lawn company said hey you got a gas leak out here.
[39:18.080 --> 39:22.240]  Now you see video out of China where somebody gets hit by a car on a busy street and nobody
[39:22.240 --> 39:27.480]  helps them and other authoritarian countries because you learn that nobody stands up for
[39:27.480 --> 39:31.000]  you, why should you stand up for them and that's what you have in authoritarian societies
[39:31.000 --> 39:33.480]  is people not helping each other.
[39:33.480 --> 39:37.400]  It's the same thing with these poison shots, we know they're killing people, we know they
[39:37.400 --> 39:42.080]  don't protect you, we know it's by design and they're testing to see if they can just
[39:42.080 --> 39:43.080]  normalize this.
[39:43.080 --> 39:44.080]  Well what about the children?
[39:44.080 --> 39:48.360]  Because we can laugh at libtards all day and say go get your fifth booster, go ahead
[39:48.360 --> 39:53.600]  and die, you're winning the Darwin Award, go ahead and extinct yourself but the children
[39:53.600 --> 39:57.560]  don't deserve it plus do you want to live in a society where nobody cares about each
[39:57.560 --> 39:58.560]  other?
[39:58.560 --> 40:03.440]  It'd be like if you saw your neighbor's house, you drive home from a pool game or whatever
[40:03.440 --> 40:09.040]  or a poker game at midnight and you see suspicious people that aren't your neighbors loading
[40:09.040 --> 40:12.840]  your neighbor's stuff into a van at midnight, you call the police because you want to be
[40:12.840 --> 40:16.880]  treated like you want to be treated.
[40:16.880 --> 40:24.720]  You treat your neighbors, do unto others as you do unto you and that's what you do.
[40:24.720 --> 40:27.920]  That's why if you see a cop, you're driving down the highway and they're radar gunning,
[40:27.920 --> 40:32.320]  you can't help it, you go ahead and flip your lights on to let people know, hey, better
[40:32.320 --> 40:34.600]  slow down.
[40:34.600 --> 40:43.320]  That's the spirit we need to heighten and intensify of working together as a civilization
[40:43.320 --> 40:47.960]  and if we don't do that, we'll all be isolated and destroyed and controlled and I have a
[40:47.960 --> 40:55.000]  big stack of news here that is so bombshell, I'll cover next segment with the latest on
[40:55.000 --> 40:58.920]  the poison shots and then governments around the world making it mandatory.
[40:58.920 --> 41:02.920]  They're not backing off this thing, that's why we got to keep pushing and fighting.
[41:02.920 --> 41:07.960]  This is their takeover of our bodies and the surveillance to make sure we've taken all
[41:07.960 --> 41:12.200]  the shots is the excuse for the total control and the castle society and I have Hillary
[41:12.200 --> 41:16.160]  admitting it in the video as well, a new video that's on info wars.com.
[41:16.160 --> 41:21.400]  So I've set the table, now let's start getting into some of the headlines that are just today's
[41:21.400 --> 41:25.000]  news with examples of this.
[41:25.000 --> 41:31.080]  America is racing towards Canada's euthanasia free for all as seven more states, I legalizing
[41:31.080 --> 41:38.080]  assisted suicide, that's by the way government pushed, deadly doses as prescribed for anorexics
[41:38.080 --> 41:45.400]  and more, nurses are inking prescriptions, so they're just making it like you're going
[41:45.400 --> 41:49.360]  to get a hamburger to give you pills that will kill you, they're making it so easy just
[41:49.360 --> 41:55.040]  to normalize this is going on, Germany, pressers twitter to commit censorship, how are they
[41:55.040 --> 41:59.600]  going to suppress us while they do this, that ties into this stack, Yale professors
[41:59.600 --> 42:07.680]  suggest mass suicide for old people in Japan and it goes on and on with the crime exploding
[42:07.680 --> 42:13.360]  in some examples of that and the democrats or deep staters or the opposite of not caring
[42:13.360 --> 42:18.440]  about their neighbors, they've gone to the more extreme, that's how it works, the slippery
[42:18.440 --> 42:22.800]  slope of wanting to kill their neighbors and an idea of wanting to hurt your fellow man
[42:22.800 --> 42:30.120]  gets you ahead when in the historical examples that never works and completely backfires,
[42:30.120 --> 42:40.120]  yes, Switzerland, suicide pods provide a painless death with VR right out of Silent Green, it's
[42:40.120 --> 42:48.880]  all coming up today on this live Sunday, February 12, 2023 transmission and so much more, have

[47:53.480 --> 48:00.480]  hurting yourself, but you're an adult, you want to kill yourself, that's your right to
[48:00.480 --> 48:01.480]  do it.
[48:01.480 --> 48:02.480]  But what about the children?
[48:02.480 --> 48:03.480]  You see, they can't abort them before they're born.
[48:03.480 --> 48:08.560]  They want to transgender them and cut their genitals off and their breasts off later.
[48:08.560 --> 48:12.520]  This is the control they want and let's, before we look at the crime exploding, look at some
[48:12.520 --> 48:13.840]  of these headlines.
[48:13.840 --> 48:20.800]  It begins, we've got the video, Brazilian socialist president Lula da Silva forces poor
[48:20.800 --> 48:25.880]  families to vaccinate their children so they can receive financial aid from his regime or
[48:25.880 --> 48:32.000]  risk receiving nothing and the country's going full communist so you don't have a choice.
[48:32.000 --> 48:35.720]  Big report on that from thegatewaypunna.com.
[48:35.720 --> 48:41.960]  It's also on infowars.com and there is Lula on TV saying it right out there in the open
[48:41.960 --> 48:50.040]  and it's Pfizer coming in that has a deal with him to do this, depopulating his own people.
[48:50.040 --> 48:54.880]  But Bernie Sanders is going to save us, Bernie Sanders has a new role, could be his final
[48:54.880 --> 48:56.520]  act in Washington.
[48:56.520 --> 49:00.840]  He's going to call in the heads of big farmer that made billions, opt the shots and ask
[49:00.840 --> 49:02.200]  why they made profits.
[49:02.200 --> 49:05.640]  He's defending the shots saying they're good.
[49:05.640 --> 49:08.520]  He's making the issue about how the fact that they're getting filthy rich and have made
[49:08.520 --> 49:15.560]  over a hundred billion between the four companies together, most of it Pfizer.
[49:15.560 --> 49:16.920]  Now let's start playing these clips.
[49:16.920 --> 49:21.280]  This is Robert F. Kennedy Jr., this is all confirmed, I told you this three years ago,
[49:21.280 --> 49:25.640]  Dr. Peter McCullough confirmed it now, the documents are all there in the Twitter files,
[49:25.640 --> 49:30.320]  that's just one area that we can find them but because of Musk we know about it.
[49:30.320 --> 49:35.160]  He says the vaccine is a Pentagon project, says Robert F. Kennedy Jr., which is a fact
[49:35.160 --> 49:39.000]  that they farmed it out to Gates and others to then release the virus and roll the entire
[49:39.000 --> 49:40.000]  attack out.
[49:40.000 --> 49:46.120]  Now that's not our average military men and women, that is the new world order that sees
[49:46.120 --> 49:48.280]  humans as the threat.
[49:48.280 --> 49:50.280]  Here is Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[49:50.280 --> 49:56.440]  There were 138 companies that were involved in manufacturing and distributing the vaccine,
[49:56.440 --> 49:57.960]  they're all military contractors.
[49:57.960 --> 50:04.400]  The Pentagon and the National Security Agency were in the entire pandemic response, Pfizer
[50:04.400 --> 50:11.720]  and Moderna don't really own those vaccines, they slapped their labels on them but it was
[50:11.720 --> 50:16.720]  a Pentagon project.
[50:16.720 --> 50:24.040]  Alright, let's go to the next clip, let's go to clip 13, crew.
[50:24.040 --> 50:31.080]  This is Josh Sterling, highly respected insurance analyst at a state hearing with Edward Dowd,
[50:31.080 --> 50:37.960]  the people who are under the age of 50 who took the vaccine now are 49% higher mortality
[50:37.960 --> 50:38.960]  rate.
[50:38.960 --> 50:43.200]  Edward Dowd's increases it 145%, that's because it was going to kill you, usually kills you
[50:43.200 --> 50:47.280]  the first one, but it continues to increase it up to several hundred percentage points
[50:47.280 --> 50:50.840]  if you take four or more of the shots and these numbers are mirrored from Australia
[50:50.840 --> 50:53.040]  to Germany to the US.
[50:53.040 --> 50:55.040]  Here is Josh Sterling.
[50:55.040 --> 50:59.840]  The senator asked us to show just the one chart that tells the entire story.
[50:59.840 --> 51:06.720]  This is that chart, the UK government until this summer was reporting a data series that
[51:06.720 --> 51:11.760]  showed the relative mortality rates for the vaccinated and unvaccinated by the number
[51:11.760 --> 51:14.320]  of doses of the vaccine.
[51:14.320 --> 51:18.320]  We've done what we think is really professional work with this and we think it simplifies
[51:18.320 --> 51:22.720]  down to a conclusion that says that through the last available data set, the people in
[51:22.720 --> 51:27.560]  the UK who took the vaccine have a 26% higher mortality rate.
[51:27.560 --> 51:33.680]  The people who are under the age of 50 who took the vaccine now have a 49% higher mortality
[51:33.680 --> 51:34.880]  rate.
[51:34.880 --> 51:40.880]  And worst of all, the people who only took one dose of the vaccine have approximately
[51:40.880 --> 51:46.360]  145% worse mortality rate.
[51:46.360 --> 51:52.000]  That last data point is on its face confusing, especially because it seems like there's more
[51:52.000 --> 51:58.280]  and more, you know, it just doesn't make a ton of sense, unless you realize that what's
[51:58.280 --> 52:03.200]  going on with this really is that the people who took the dose, the first dose in the United
[52:03.200 --> 52:07.880]  States, that's about 12% of people, but then stopped taking any other doses.
[52:07.880 --> 52:13.560]  Those people, through their choice to stop, disproportionately the ones who were harmed.
[52:13.560 --> 52:17.560]  And so what we're concluding is that if you happen to be an unlucky person who was in
[52:17.560 --> 52:22.520]  some fashion even moderately injured, with a minor injury, you've decided not to continue.
[52:22.520 --> 52:26.800]  The statistics, the best statistics we have show that you're going to have, at least through
[52:26.800 --> 52:30.760]  today, maybe it'll get better, you know, and obviously we're all here because we're hoping
[52:30.760 --> 52:35.680]  to find treatments and cures and screening and interventions, you know, but if that doesn't
[52:35.680 --> 52:39.920]  happen, we have to assume that this is now the baseline, there's going to be 145% higher
[52:39.920 --> 52:40.920]  mortality.
[52:40.920 --> 52:44.400]  And if you were to take these numbers and just apply them to the United States, that ends
[52:44.400 --> 52:50.080]  up being something like 600,000 excess deaths per year in the United States from this higher
[52:50.080 --> 52:52.080]  vaccine-induced mortality.
[52:52.080 --> 52:56.720]  And you know, that's obviously a really concerning thing, and I'm happy you called the meeting
[52:56.720 --> 52:59.520]  and I know we're all hoping to get answers.
[52:59.520 --> 53:00.520]  Thank you.
[53:00.520 --> 53:03.800]  I thought that statistic on a single dose was pretty interesting because let's face
[53:03.800 --> 53:09.960]  it, just about everybody knows somebody who took, you know, the first dose and had a severe
[53:09.960 --> 53:13.280]  action, they're not going to take the second one.
[53:13.280 --> 53:17.120]  That's a federal hearing with Senator Johnson.
[53:17.120 --> 53:19.960]  I also have state hearings here.
[53:19.960 --> 53:21.720]  This is another federal hearing.
[53:21.720 --> 53:26.960]  This is representative Nancy Mace ripping into the Twitter executives that suppressed
[53:26.960 --> 53:31.800]  targeting medical knowledge and the former Twitter executives about blocking COVID information
[53:31.800 --> 53:38.120]  directly by Big Pharma and the federal government Democratic Party blocking from day one knowing
[53:38.120 --> 53:39.960]  what they were doing premeditated.
[53:39.960 --> 53:44.480]  Now listen what it's done to this woman.
[53:44.480 --> 53:47.200]  Consequences for this type of online harassment and speech.
[53:47.200 --> 53:51.960]  Oh, that's, I must say, those are very real consequences.
[53:51.960 --> 53:52.960]  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[53:52.960 --> 53:55.640]  The Twitter files were not just about Hunter Biden's laptop.
[53:55.640 --> 53:59.880]  Hunter worked overtime to suppress accurate COVID information.
[53:59.880 --> 54:04.040]  Apparently the views of a Stanford doctor are disinformation to you people.
[54:04.040 --> 54:06.960]  I along with media Americans have long-term effects from COVID.
[54:06.960 --> 54:09.920]  Not only was I a long hauler, but I have effects from the vaccine.
[54:09.920 --> 54:14.640]  It wasn't the first shot, but it was the second shot that I now developed asthma that has
[54:14.640 --> 54:16.600]  never gone away since I had the second shot.
[54:16.600 --> 54:21.680]  I have tremors in my left hand and I have the occasional heart pain that no doctor can
[54:21.680 --> 54:24.280]  explain and I've had a battery of tests.
[54:24.280 --> 54:28.320]  I have great regrets about getting the shot because of the health issues that I now have
[54:28.320 --> 54:31.400]  that I don't think are ever going to go away.
[54:31.400 --> 54:32.720]  Where did you go to medical school?
[54:32.720 --> 54:33.880]  I did not go to medical school.
[54:33.880 --> 54:34.880]  I'm sorry?
[54:34.880 --> 54:35.880]  I did not go to medical school.
[54:35.880 --> 54:37.880]  That's what I thought.
[54:37.880 --> 54:42.560]  Why do you think you or anyone else at Twitter have the medical expertise to censor a doctor's
[54:42.560 --> 54:44.760]  expert opinion?
[54:44.760 --> 54:50.280]  Our policies regarding COVID were designed to protect individuals we were seeing.
[54:50.280 --> 54:54.520]  You guys censored Harvard-educated doctors, Stanford-educated doctors, doctors that are
[54:54.520 --> 54:59.360]  educated in the best places in the world and you silenced those voices.
[54:59.360 --> 55:02.360]  You're not a doctor, right, Ms. Gatti?
[55:02.360 --> 55:04.160]  No, I'm not.
[55:04.160 --> 55:05.160]  Okay.
[55:05.160 --> 55:08.040]  What makes you think you or anyone else at Twitter have the medical expertise to censor
[55:08.040 --> 55:11.360]  actual, accurate CDC data?
[55:11.360 --> 55:14.200]  I'm not familiar with these particular situations.
[55:14.200 --> 55:15.200]  Yeah, I'm sure you're not.
[55:15.200 --> 55:16.200]  It's not just about the laptop.
[55:16.200 --> 55:20.600]  This is about the medical advice that expert doctors were trying to give Americans because
[55:20.600 --> 55:24.920]  social media companies like Twitter were silencing their voices.
[55:24.920 --> 55:29.520]  Did the U.S. government ever contact you or anyone at Twitter to press your Twitter to
[55:29.520 --> 55:33.800]  moderate or censor certain tweets?
[55:33.800 --> 55:36.920]  Yes or no?
[55:36.920 --> 55:39.320]  We have a program.
[55:39.320 --> 55:45.120]  Did the U.S. government ever contact you or anyone at Twitter to censor or moderate certain
[55:45.120 --> 55:46.120]  tweets?
[55:46.120 --> 55:47.120]  No or no.
[55:47.120 --> 55:50.760]  We received legal demands to remove content from the platform, from the U.S. government
[55:50.760 --> 55:52.560]  and governments all around the world.
[55:52.560 --> 55:53.560]  Thank God for Matt Taibbi.
[55:53.560 --> 55:57.680]  Thank God for Elon Musk for allowing to show us in the world that Twitter was basically
[55:57.680 --> 56:00.240]  a subsidiary of the FBI.
[56:00.240 --> 56:04.800]  All right, now, I'm going to play this next clip and we played this a few years ago, but
[56:04.800 --> 56:05.800]  it's resurfaced.
[56:05.800 --> 56:09.120]  I'm only going to play 30 seconds of it, but this is not out of context.
[56:09.120 --> 56:10.960]  She goes on and on to say white people are bad.
[56:10.960 --> 56:11.960]  They won't take the shots.
[56:11.960 --> 56:16.800]  It's actually the higher educated you are that won't take the shots, and she says we
[56:16.800 --> 56:17.800]  need to kill the white people.
[56:17.800 --> 56:19.520]  We need to get rid of the white people.
[56:19.520 --> 56:24.200]  Here is Carol Baker, who's an old white lady, the head CDC official in Texas at a Texas
[56:24.200 --> 56:25.200]  hearing.
[56:25.200 --> 56:26.200]  Here it is.
[56:26.200 --> 56:27.960]  The solution.
[56:27.960 --> 56:33.200]  Every study published in the last five years, when you look at vaccine refusers, I'm not
[56:33.200 --> 56:40.880]  talking about, well, hesitance, most of them we can talk into coming to terms, but refusers.
[56:40.880 --> 56:47.960]  You'll just get rid of all the whites in the United States because it is the most diverse
[56:47.960 --> 56:50.480]  city in the entire United States.
[56:50.480 --> 56:52.720]  There are seven Asian language spoken.
[56:52.720 --> 56:55.080]  All right, it's a sick clip.
[56:55.080 --> 56:59.560]  By the way, we have a 10 minute compilation of the hearings.
[56:59.560 --> 57:04.400]  That's on info wars.com, but the last segment of the show tonight, I'm going to air a John
[57:04.400 --> 57:09.640]  Bounds report on this that is extremely powerful.
[57:09.640 --> 57:11.640]  Hour number two is coming up.
[57:11.640 --> 57:18.080]  The name of John Bounds report that's on Band-Aid video is the tyrannical Twitter clown show.
[57:18.080 --> 57:21.600]  I suggest you share that with everyone you know.
[57:21.600 --> 57:26.800]  But this is serious surveillance and information warfare to carry this out.
[57:26.800 --> 57:30.240]  And it's not going well with the New World Order, but we haven't beaten them yet.
[57:30.240 --> 57:31.560]  So it's a life and death situation.
[57:31.560 --> 57:32.560]  We got to save lives.
[57:32.560 --> 57:36.120]  I want to thank our stations and affiliates, so everybody tune in now.
[57:36.120 --> 57:39.600]  Hour number two straight ahead is a lot more important than who wins the stupid Super
[57:39.600 --> 57:40.600]  Bowl tonight.
[57:40.600 --> 57:42.280]  This is a life and death situation.
[57:42.280 --> 57:44.560]  It's an active war they've carried out against us.
[57:44.560 --> 58:14.360]  Share the links now.
[58:14.560 --> 58:18.760]  We're going to make it easy to fund with great products and power you and your immune system
[58:18.760 --> 58:19.760]  and your family as well.
[58:19.760 --> 58:24.720]  You can also make straight donations at infowarstore.com, clicking on the big red banner, a one time
[58:24.720 --> 58:27.520]  or recurring, but I'm asking you to take action.
[58:27.520 --> 58:28.520]  We're nonviolent.
[58:28.520 --> 58:31.480]  But every time you donate money, every time you buy products, every time you keep us on
[58:31.480 --> 58:36.920]  air, you are literally nonviolently politically punching the New World Order in the nose, punching
[58:36.920 --> 58:38.920]  their lies in the nose.
[58:38.920 --> 58:40.800]  We are going to defeat the New World Order.
[58:40.800 --> 58:41.800]  We're going over the top.
[58:41.800 --> 58:49.360]  But right now is the critical juncture, so please go to infowarstore.com and donate now.
[58:49.360 --> 58:55.640]  In the year 2000, Alex Jones' film, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, showed the
[58:55.640 --> 59:04.040]  world how our so-called elite leaders practice mock ritual sacrifices in private.
[59:04.040 --> 59:11.200]  In 2007, Alex Jones releases Endgame, exposing the world elite's plans for covertly using
[59:11.200 --> 59:14.960]  biological weapons against all of mankind.
[59:14.960 --> 59:21.440]  And by the time they launched their attack in 2020, Alex Jones' info wars and our audience
[59:21.440 --> 59:26.880]  were there to warn the people of the deadly vaccines that we knew were coming.
[59:26.880 --> 59:28.920]  This is why they attack us.
[59:28.920 --> 59:31.520]  This is why we need your support.
[59:31.520 --> 59:35.520]  Because we tell the truth, Alex Jones was right.
[59:35.520 --> 59:41.840]  Join the resistance, buy products, donate to the cause, share the leaks, join us in
[59:41.840 --> 59:49.040]  the fight for freedom, and help us defeat the New World Order.
[59:49.040 --> 59:58.360]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[59:58.360 --> 01:00:06.960]  All right, we're in to hour number two, the story just went live on infowars.com.
[01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:11.560]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:18.760]  Breaking from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:23.480]  Breaking, octagonal, I guess that's the same as a stop sign, object shot down over Lake
[01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:28.520]  Caron, it's on infowars.com, breaking right now with members of Congress saying they've
[01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:31.720]  been in contact with the DOD regarding it.
[01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:36.360]  Look, this is the U.S. going to war with Russia and China ahead of the Russian offensive.
[01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:37.360]  It's not aliens.
[01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:41.360]  This is a very, very serious situation.
[01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:45.400]  And I've talked a lot about Nord Stream 2 and how all this other news has been distracting
[01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:46.400]  from that.
[01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:51.280]  But Tucker Carlson did a great job on Friday night explaining what's really going on in
[01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:53.160]  the Nord Stream pipeline being blown up.
[01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:59.720]  An act of war against the population, and an act of war against Russia, and the fact
[01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:07.240]  that Biden would brag about it and then deny he'd done it, is next level.
[01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:10.280]  So we're going to play this clip and come back.
[01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:16.520]  U.S. military shoots down octagonal flying object near Canadian border, two U.S. official
[01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:20.360]  speaking conditions in anonymity told Reuters the military had shot down the object.
[01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:22.240]  That's the biggest paper in Canada.
[01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:23.240]  That's the national post.
[01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:25.960]  The story is also on infowords.com.
[01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:28.840]  Please share the article and get it out to everyone you know.
[01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:29.840]  That's how we reach new people.
[01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:33.600]  Hey, Alex Jones is live on there right now covering another object shot down.
[01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:37.040]  People are like, ooh, they'll tune in and then they hear the truth and then we continue
[01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:38.560]  on in the information war.
[01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:41.160]  You are the key of this fight on this live Sunday broadcast.
[01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:45.840]  When we came in to cover all this as it continues to accelerate and Owen Schroeder is coming
[01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:48.160]  up in about 55 minutes.
[01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:50.040]  Let's go to that Tucker Carlson report.
[01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:54.680]  So before the war in Ukraine even began, both Toria Nulin at the State Department, the number
[01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:59.480]  two of the State Department, and Joe Biden threatened to blow up the Nord Stream pipeline.
[01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:00.480]  Watch.
[01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:03.640]  I want to be clear with you today.
[01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:10.600]  If Russia invades Ukraine, one way or another, Nord Stream 2 will not move forward.
[01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:19.320]  If Russia invades, that means tanks and troops crossing the border of Ukraine again.
[01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:25.600]  Then there will be no longer a Nord Stream 2.
[01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:29.840]  We will bring it into it.
[01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:37.920]  How will you do that exactly since the project and control of the project is within Germany's
[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:39.920]  control?
[01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:44.120]  We will, I promise you, we'll be able to do it.
[01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:49.160]  So then the pipelines actually blew up, these pipelines that bring natural gas from Eastern
[01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:53.160]  Europe to Western Europe to keep the European economy going, and they exploded, causing
[01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:58.960]  the single largest human-caused environmental disaster in all of history.
[01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:03.680]  And again, setting Europe on the road to actual poverty.
[01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:07.520]  So it was an unpopular event, and Joe Biden denied any responsibility.
[01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:09.320]  In fact, he blamed Russia.
[01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:14.200]  Joe Biden and his whole administration told us that somehow Russia, for reasons they never
[01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:19.320]  made clear just because they're evil, had sabotaged their own energy pipeline.
[01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:20.320]  Watch this.
[01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:27.880]  It was a deliberate act of sabotage, and now the Russians are pumping out disinformation
[01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:29.880]  lies.
[01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:33.480]  So that was in September, and it was obviously the very first day, well, that's not true.
[01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:37.840]  It's not that Vladimir Putin is too good a person to blow up Nord Stream, but like,
[01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:38.840]  why would he?
[01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:39.840]  It only hurts him.
[01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:43.480]  And by the way, it really hurts Western Europe.
[01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:45.880]  But a lot of media outlets repeated that lie dutifully.
[01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:50.400]  That's what they do and attacked us as Putin's stooges for having questions about it.
[01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:51.800]  Well, we know a lot more now.
[01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:56.360]  There have been a number of official investigations of what happened, and not one has found any
[01:03:56.360 --> 01:03:58.080]  evidence of Russian involvement.
[01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:00.080]  And now we have the actual answer to what happened.
[01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:01.640]  Oh, the Biden administration did it.
[01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:02.640]  For real.
[01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:06.720]  Investigator reporter Seymour Hirsch, who's been around for more than 50 years, just wrote
[01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:12.800]  a piece on Substack that includes this, quote, last June, the Navy divers, U.S. Navy divers,
[01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:17.400]  standing under the cover of a widely-publicized mid-summer NATO exercise known as ball-tops
[01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:22.480]  22, planted remotely-triggered explosives that three months later destroyed three of
[01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:27.480]  the four Nord Stream pipelines, according to a source with direct knowledge of the operational
[01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:28.480]  planning.
[01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:29.480]  Now, this piece continues.
[01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:33.360]  It's probably the most comprehensive news story you will read this year.
[01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:38.840]  Seymour Hirsch on Substack, you should read it, and it recounts in detail meetings with
[01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:42.160]  the National Security Advisor at the White House where this was planned, exactly what
[01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:46.760]  the explosives were used, how they were triggered, by what aircraft, on what day.
[01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:51.000]  So many details in here that it is not possible that it's not true.
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.000]  It is true.
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.960]  And, in fact, no one in the high level of the U.S. government is denying it with any
[01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:58.960]  specificity and said the White House is just dismissing this utterly false.
[01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:00.440]  And no reporters are sure of it.
[01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:07.200]  Mark Twain, one of America's greatest writers and satirist in Mies, famously said more than
[01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:13.560]  150 years ago, rumors of his demise had been greatly exaggerated, because the newspaper
[01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:19.480]  kept saying he died decades before he did die, and it's the same psi-op today.
[01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:23.800]  Info wars is more influential and more powerful than ever because of your support and because
[01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:26.880]  of the facts of what we've covered is coming true.
[01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:30.560]  But if they can convince you we've been shut down, if they can convince you that we're
[01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:35.720]  going away, and you stop supporting, you stop spreading the word, then they do win.
[01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:40.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's only one group of people that can shut down info wars, and
[01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:41.800]  that's you, the viewers and listeners.
[01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:43.760]  If you decide we're done, we're done.
[01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:47.920]  If you decide to go to infowarstore.com and get supplements and books and films and t-shirts
[01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:51.040]  and so much more, we will stay on the air indefinitely.
[01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:52.440]  It is all in your hands.
[01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:56.680]  So thanks for your support, stand up against the globalists, go to infowarstore.com right
[01:05:56.680 --> 01:05:58.280]  now and keep us on air.
[01:05:58.280 --> 01:06:14.560]  It's up to you.
[01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:17.440]  Well we're into hour number two and some major news just broke.
[01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:18.440]  It's up on infowars.com.
[01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:26.600]  It's also the national post, also being picked up by CNN, US shoots down, Octagonal, that's
[01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:32.960]  the same of a stop sign, flying object near Canadian border using F-16s, here's what we
[01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:33.960]  know.
[01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:38.560]  A senior US official said the object had an octagonal structure with a no discernible
[01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:39.560]  payload.
[01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:43.920]  A senior administration official said on condition anonymity the United States has no indication
[01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:47.200]  the object posed military threat or had surveillance capabilities.
[01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:53.040]  The object was recently detected over Montana, prompting the closure of US airspace, the
[01:06:53.040 --> 01:07:01.080]  official said, but then it made its way all the way from there to the Michigan Canadian
[01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:02.080]  border.
[01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:07.760]  This marks the fourth unidentified flying object that has been destroyed near the North
[01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:15.960]  America this month, flying over North America straining US relations with China and it goes
[01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:19.000]  on from there.
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:23.840]  There's the CNN headline, object shot down near Lake Huron, Pentagon confirms F-16 fighter
[01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:29.520]  jet shot down an airborne object over Lake Huron.
[01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:36.040]  Canada confirmed that as well, breaking octagon ship aircraft shot down over Lake Huron by
[01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:42.160]  US Air Force, there's the info wars, headline breaking octagonal object shot down over Lake
[01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:43.160]  Huron.
[01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:47.080]  What's really being shot down is our immune system and our medical rights and the ownership
[01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:50.800]  of our body and the target of our children with these poison shots all over the world,
[01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:54.320]  including here in the United States, but now we're looking up to the sky for all these
[01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:58.880]  balloons and other craft that have always been up there for the last few decades with
[01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:03.680]  private corporations, governments, you name it, flying around above the regular air travel
[01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:08.320]  that goes up to 40,000 feet and if you think that's surveillance, show me about the satellites
[01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:12.720]  and I'm not poo-pooing, that isn't important, but why is it coming out now, China says they
[01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:25.400]  went after a UFO, right around US war drills, by Taiwan today, all hell is breaking loose,
[01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:27.480]  ladies and gentlemen.
[01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:34.400]  Now they just had more drills this week in several cities and last week with black helicopters
[01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:38.520]  flying around, attacking buildings that covertly leased and troops coming out of the sky and
[01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:41.600]  if you talk about it in the past, they'd say, oh there weren't any black helicopters here,
[01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:45.600]  even though several times we went and caught it on tape in Texas, they were doing it so
[01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:49.720]  much in the mid-1990s, they'd say on the news, Jones is crazy, there's no such thing as black
[01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:53.360]  helicopters, later they admitted the whole thing, so it's the same thing.
[01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:58.720]  This is all covert operations going on, it shows how much closer to all-out war we are
[01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:06.760]  with Russia and China and it's that threat escalation as we go up the ladder.
[01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:11.440]  Because I covered the start of the first hour, there's so much hype going on in the corporate
[01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:16.280]  media that these are flying saucers, these are aliens and that is ridiculous, not saying
[01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:26.120]  that stuff doesn't exist in some way or sometime but almost always, it is a governmental operation
[01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:30.800]  and all these major countries have a lot of hidden stuff, you gotta ask why is it suddenly
[01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:35.400]  getting shot down, it's because we're going into a war footing against China and during
[01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:39.360]  Trump, they didn't tell him and before that with Obama, they let these things fly all
[01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:43.480]  over the United States but it is true that Trump administration had these flying above
[01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:48.080]  the US, knew about it, did nothing because Trump was not told, that's not confirmed,
[01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:57.000]  which is the treason of Milley and all of them in the White House for the four years
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:02.000]  of Trump, Trump was not aware of it and obviously would have done something about it, so this
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:09.640]  is a big, big deal, not because these things are new but because they're now being targeted
[01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:15.440]  that tells you that they have turned the page towards even greater levels of escalation
[01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:21.680]  as Russia prepares to invade with thousands of more tanks, thousands of more helicopters
[01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:28.920]  and 500,000 troops preparing the new invasion is imminent, I believe they will launch the
[01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:36.800]  attack before the holiday, that's what it is now, the Russia date, it's like a holiday
[01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:43.400]  for Ukraine, a holiday in Russia, a big date to look at and maybe because the intel is
[01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:47.200]  the Russians are about to invade, maybe they'll wait till after, I don't know but the ground
[01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:52.800]  will fall and it will be very, very hard for the Russians to move forward if that is the
[01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:56.760]  case and I've been reading reports out of Russia and even reports out of the US that
[01:10:56.760 --> 01:11:01.480]  basically agree with each other but this is almost like trench warfare in World War One
[01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:05.560]  where it's wave after wave of troops killing each other, hundreds of thousands of dead
[01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:12.480]  Ukrainian troops and other mercenaries that came to join the fight and soldiers of fortune
[01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:17.840]  and then hundreds of thousands of dead Russian troops, this is a real war like the Korean
[01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:27.920]  War and it is extremely, extremely probable that this is going to continue to escalate
[01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:34.200]  on up to the highest levels of threat and responses and we'll be here covering it, you
[01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:38.080]  know I could have stayed home tonight, I'm not a hero, I just am not interested in Super
[01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:41.640]  Bowl, though if I sat down and started eating barbecue and watching a football game, I like
[01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:47.480]  football as much as the next person but how do you do that when all hell is breaking
[01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:51.960]  loose and every broadcast we're on air is so precious and the enemies of freedom are
[01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:58.600]  all over the control news saying we want Alex Jones off air, we want to silence Alex Jones,
[01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:04.000]  well should I silence myself then and then just sit there and shove barbecue in my mouth
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:10.880]  and watch a bunch of anti-American propaganda ads and leftist garbage and Pfizer commercials
[01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:14.560]  and I'm not mad at you if you're watching the Super Bowl, the point is though we got
[01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:18.760]  lured into bread and circuses, lured into all these distractions and that's why we're
[01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:24.120]  in so much trouble now because we don't have our priorities straight.
[01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:30.240]  Owen Schroyer got into talk radio as a sportscaster, was already successful by the age of 20, already
[01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:35.800]  hosting shows but he woke up to the New World Order, didn't even know about it and then
[01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:40.800]  became a leading light and the fight against it, he'll be here coming up in about 48 minutes
[01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:46.720]  for now to host Sunday Live at 6pm and I know take your phone calls, I've not been taking
[01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:51.760]  calls tonight because I've got a lot more news I need to get to and there's so much
[01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:57.520]  breaking here but I know that Owen will be taking phone calls, just so I know Owen, 6pm
[01:12:57.520 --> 01:13:00.520]  central and I've been trying to get better at taking phone calls, during the weekday
[01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:05.360]  show 11am to 3pm I've been taking a lot of them, Harrison Smith always takes them but
[01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:09.600]  we do need to also take time out to cover the news, though callers always take us in interesting
[01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:13.680]  directions and are incredibly, incredibly informative.
[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:18.200]  Now let's get back into the censorship that's coming out and I'm going to end this hour
[01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:24.480]  with a special report that's really chronicled this but this is a big deal because we told
[01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:30.680]  you this in 2016, Obama signed the defense authorization act in 2017, his last major
[01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:35.720]  legislative act, spending billions of dollars to call the American people Russians and turn
[01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:42.040]  the CIA and other agencies loose on us and so big tech is just the enforcer of this along
[01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:43.720]  with dinosaur media.
[01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:46.920]  The ruling class wanted to run America in the ground, America had woken up, America
[01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:50.160]  was taking their country back with Trump, not that he's perfect but that she was a manifestation
[01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:55.320]  of that and that's why they hate Trump so much because they hate you so much.
[01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:58.800]  The first thing Biden did when he got in was put out a new threat assessment saying it's
[01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:03.920]  not jihadese, it's not MS-13, it's not the Chai comms, it's not the Russians, the big
[01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:08.800]  threat are people that have opposition to covid measures or don't like lockdowns or
[01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:13.320]  force injections, claims of election fraud, believe Trump can be in reinstated or the
[01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:16.160]  9-11 anniversary or religious holidays.
[01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:22.400]  Now we have all these articles out demonizing Catholics of all people and these internal
[01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:28.200]  FBI documents that came out where they're saying the name threat is orthodox Catholics
[01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:33.040]  who are one of the most nonviolent groups out there statistically, it's just disgusting
[01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:38.040]  but there's a civil war going on inside the Catholic Church for its heart and soul with
[01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:42.560]  this leftist pope trying to overturn every Catholic canon, you can say well Catholic
[01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:46.240]  Church isn't perfect, well no Christian institution in America has been perfect or anywhere in
[01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:50.040]  the world since Christ came along, the orthodox church isn't perfect and I'm not a Catholic,
[01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:54.680]  I'm on the orthodox church, I'm not an evangelical, I'm not a Baptist, I am a follower of Christ,
[01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:58.600]  doesn't mean I'm perfect but I love Jesus and I know that the Bible is really happening
[01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:04.200]  and the mark of the beast and all of it and I've got a whole stack of articles here that
[01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:08.080]  I just had before I went to break and now I'm moving around but I'll find all my stuff
[01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:11.640]  on the persecution of Catholics, I mean it's all over the news, you see it there but this
[01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:16.240]  is just crazy that while all this is going on they're saying right wingers the number
[01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:23.640]  one threat and out of the right wingers traditionalist Catholics are the main threat, I mean imagine
[01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:30.280]  our government is openly saying that but so is the pope, the pope is attacking real Catholics,
[01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:34.480]  that's really what they are and in Israel they go after the orthodox and ultra orthodox
[01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:40.760]  Jews and CPS their kids and force inject them, why are they going after orthodox people,
[01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:45.880]  why is Zelensky going after the orthodox church in Ukraine because they are old school and
[01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:50.360]  aren't globalist controlled and they represent what's left of the original people that are
[01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:55.720]  faithful, okay that's what's going on, we all need to band together as real Christians
[01:15:55.720 --> 01:15:58.720]  with the Bible.
[01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:03.760]  Everybody that's watching this needs to support Alex Jones, needs to support Infowars and
[01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:08.280]  banned.video, you know the Bible says let another mouth praise you, I'm going to do that right
[01:16:08.280 --> 01:16:14.480]  now, Alex Jones has helped so many people in this industry, you guys have no idea how
[01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:19.120]  many people have got their first start like Savannah Hernandez, how many people have just
[01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:24.360]  been put on a launch pad to outer space because of Alex Jones including myself, I've been
[01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:29.000]  given so many opportunities because of this man and because of this platform and I would
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:33.200]  probably not even be half of where I am right now if it weren't for Alex Jones, I mean I've
[01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:38.080]  been able to be on podcasts with Alex and Joe Rogan and Tim Cass, the super Tim Cass
[01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:44.360]  IRL, listen what I'm saying is do not take Alex Jones and banned.video for granted because
[01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:49.000]  you don't know what you have until it's gone, we need to support free speech systems right
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:53.720]  now, so go check out the store, go support their store, go support Infowars, leave a
[01:16:53.720 --> 01:16:58.800]  donation right now, don't wait until they're gone.
[01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:05.840]  In the year 2000, Alex Jones' film Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove showed the world how
[01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:12.000]  our so-called elite leaders practice mock ritual sacrifices in private.
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:20.680]  In 2007, Alex Jones releases Endgame, exposing the world elite's plans for covertly using
[01:17:20.680 --> 01:17:26.360]  biological weapons against all of mankind and by the time they launched their attack
[01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:33.440]  in 2020, Alex Jones' Infowars and our audience were there to warn the people of the deadly
[01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:39.840]  vaccines that we knew were coming, this is why they attack us, this is why we need your
[01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:44.960]  support because we tell the truth, Alex Jones was right.

[01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:08.600]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:30.280]  So if people were sitting down in the 1950s or something and they were wondering, I wonder
[01:20:30.280 --> 01:20:35.240]  what is going to take place over the next 20 years and if you think about the Kennedy
[01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:41.920]  assassination is coming, the Cuban Missile Crisis, Vietnam, the hippie explosion, psychedelia,
[01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:46.840]  all the rest of it, I mean, it is impossible to predict.
[01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:51.800]  The concept of deep events that Professor Scott came up with and we've seen deep events,
[01:20:51.800 --> 01:21:00.440]  the deep events are caused by a group, the deep state in this case, so like a Iran Contra
[01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:06.800]  or the 2008 financial crisis where they said, you know, if you don't give us all that money
[01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:12.080]  out of the Treasury, there's going to be martial law to the Congress people.
[01:21:12.080 --> 01:21:18.960]  The COVID operation, Iran Contra, 9-11, things of this nature, those are deep events.
[01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:27.400]  What happens is this group that is working side by side with us comes in, the covert
[01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:34.640]  group comes in, they do some kind of deep event to get a policy change across the board,
[01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:40.280]  sometimes worldwide, and then they step back and they leave all the rubble of what they've
[01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:45.080]  done and people look for the trails back to, you know, I mean, actually most of the time
[01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:49.200]  people just get on with their lives and are just like, well, I don't know what just happened,
[01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:56.440]  but I'm going to try to deal with it, but the tracks lead back somewhere and so another
[01:21:56.440 --> 01:21:58.680]  deep event is coming.
[01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:06.600]  The UFO file and the UFO threat being the deep event for me is in the cards and I feel
[01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:13.160]  like it's pretty close, so therefore when I see this kind of activity and I see the continuity
[01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:19.640]  of government players upfront as the front people for it, talking about it and also creating
[01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:26.640]  spin about, oh, hey, we didn't know the balloons escaped our sensors and stuff, no way, no
[01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:34.600]  way, I know that they're lying, so that is unnerving and it lets me know that their timetable
[01:22:34.600 --> 01:22:41.160]  is a float, you know, it's a way.
[01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:46.040]  That's dark journalism, that's what it goes by, dead on, the deep state needs a crisis
[01:22:46.040 --> 01:22:51.400]  and I've said it's cyber attacks, wars, or it could be the fake alien invasion and certainly
[01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:55.360]  they're hyping that now at fever pitch.
[01:22:55.360 --> 01:22:59.240]  So continuing, U.S. State Department funding, secret disinformation crusade to blacklist
[01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:06.760]  conservatives, it's all public now in Congress, Germany pressures Twitter to commit to censorship
[01:23:06.760 --> 01:23:12.000]  law, so does the U.N., see how we're under world government already, we have the tyrannical
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:16.360]  clown show, compilation coming up in the last second of the hour, we're going to be pairing,
[01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:22.880]  and remember what happened to Laura Loomer and myself and Paul Watson and nine others,
[01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:30.560]  nine others in April of 2020, the globalist controlled Facebook came out and said there
[01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:34.360]  are now people called dangerous individuals, there's only 12 of them on the earth, they
[01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:39.480]  weren't Chinese dictators or North Korean dictators or, no, it wasn't Hunter Biden,
[01:23:39.480 --> 01:23:44.680]  it was Alex Jones, Laura Loomer, Paul Joseph Watson, Gavin McGinnis, Lewis Farrakhan and
[01:23:44.680 --> 01:23:49.760]  a few others and they said in the document, we have a shot of it here, that you are allowed
[01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:55.040]  to call for violence against them, the original rule was we're all banned and if you say something
[01:23:55.040 --> 01:24:00.160]  positive you could be banned, there are new rule which they pulled down in about two days
[01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:07.080]  after this, was that you could call for our death, well she's followed the lawsuit over
[01:24:07.080 --> 01:24:13.200]  that, it's actually moving ahead, Facebook Inc. asked the Miami federal judge to throw
[01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:16.800]  out a lawsuit by conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer, wow, we went to Congress and told
[01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:20.960]  them this four years ago, it's all proven right, saying her ban under the dangerous
[01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:27.320]  individuals and organizations policy wasn't defamatory because reasonable minds can disagree
[01:24:27.320 --> 01:24:31.760]  about whether she's dangerous, but they use that designation to set the government on
[01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:36.280]  her and put her on all sorts of government harassment lists, well Ms. Loomer may not
[01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:41.160]  believe she is dangerous whether she promotes hate, others disagree and demonstrate by her
[01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:45.920]  admission that online platforms have widely banned her, oh because they all, tech giant
[01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:52.760]  says, because they all worked in concert, that's okay, because there was a consensus,
[01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:58.600]  because there was a consensus that we should euthanize the young people and the depressed
[01:24:58.600 --> 01:25:07.000]  and the anorexic and the old, daily mail, New York Times, meanwhile they're not just
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:11.160]  shipping and fentanyl dissolving the borders, brainwashing our children, they're defiting
[01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:16.200]  the police and all these critical areas and crimes exploding, hands off DC, local reporter,
[01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:22.720]  upset GOP voted against capital, soft on crime bill, the public is demanding answers that
[01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:28.840]  for DOJ, FBI attempted to label Catholics as potential terrorists, well they said they
[01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:34.560]  were the main threat, townhall.com, this side of the French news, French 24, Hope Francis
[01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:39.560]  faces civil war at heart of the church as he tries to ban the Latin mass and more, what's
[01:25:39.560 --> 01:25:45.960]  the FBI says bad, Latin mass, all words are bad, they're old, all things that are tradition
[01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:50.920]  are evil, you must accept the new tradition, the new tradition, Smithsonian is about to
[01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:55.760]  get a brutal lesson in constitutional rights as they kicked out Catholic students for wearing
[01:25:55.760 --> 01:26:02.000]  pro-life hats, you can wear your drag queen pedophile hat, you can do that but you can't
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:06.760]  wear a hat in a public building paid for by the people that they don't like, a dreadful
[01:26:06.760 --> 01:26:10.840]  coincidence, a second New Jersey council member is shot dead in their car but officials
[01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:15.600]  don't think they're linked and Democrats say crime dropped even though the FBI took over
[01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:21.680]  900 cities last year off the crime database to claim that.
[01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:28.040]  Representative Angel Craig assaulted in DC apartment building, I mean this is just every
[01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:35.920]  day, this is just pouring out examples of all of this and it gets crazier and crazier
[01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:40.280]  and crazier, I want to talk about the shut off of our energy and the rollout of the new
[01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:45.840]  digital currency that isn't imminent, it's happening now in the next segment, we've
[01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:52.280]  also got James O'Keefe update for you, what we thought was going on is happening, it is
[01:26:52.280 --> 01:27:00.720]  a coup against him for the great work he's done and I want to play a clip that's 30
[01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:09.240]  something years old, a very great man and that's Fletcher Prouty talking about the plan
[01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:14.000]  to shut off your energy and more, that is coming up on the other side, please don't

[01:30:21.880 --> 01:30:22.880]  enzyme.
[01:30:22.880 --> 01:30:28.440]  This one is the only enzyme that we're aware of right now that dissolves the spike protein,
[01:30:28.440 --> 01:30:32.560]  this is very important, the spike protein is loaded in the body with the COVID-19 infection
[01:30:32.560 --> 01:30:36.440]  and definitely with the vaccines, people are low with the spike protein, they don't feel
[01:30:36.440 --> 01:30:41.760]  well, this is a potential solution, hydroxychloroquine comes from a natural substance, so does
[01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:47.920]  ivermectin and now natokinase, isn't it interesting, natural substances in a sense, combating
[01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:52.040]  this man-made disaster, SARS-CoV-2 in the vaccines.

[01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:41.680]  whether you're in the United States or Canada, all the big private central banks that masquerade
[01:33:41.680 --> 01:33:47.200]  as government bodies, same groups own it, they have been saying that they're going to
[01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:51.840]  roll out a new digital currency, but they need a big event to collapse the regular currency
[01:33:51.840 --> 01:33:55.400]  and then the new digital currency will be around while the old currency is still around
[01:33:55.400 --> 01:33:58.960]  and they'll phase that one out, but the new one will be accepted at all the big stores
[01:33:58.960 --> 01:33:59.960]  and places.
[01:33:59.960 --> 01:34:04.160]  All the old currency starting with cash will not be and these central bank digital currencies
[01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:06.360]  will track everything you do, control what you do.
[01:34:06.360 --> 01:34:09.080]  We've talked about it at NAZI and it's the holy grail of control.
[01:34:09.080 --> 01:34:13.920]  So I always talk about the Rockefeller Foundation, the Carnegie Foundation, so the main ones
[01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:18.520]  that run the CIA and run the policy pretty much of most of the world, and Hillary was
[01:34:18.520 --> 01:34:24.360]  just speaking there saying we need to weaponize global warming, we need to bring in this
[01:34:24.360 --> 01:34:30.320]  new cashless digital currency to fight climate change that cash hurts the earth, not just
[01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:36.320]  your cows, not just your children, but just living is bad and paper money is bad and we
[01:34:36.320 --> 01:34:41.040]  got to cut trees down to cut the carbon, I mean this is just a total war on reality.
[01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:46.480]  Here is the deputy head of the Clinton Foundation, the globalist monster herself, morphing into
[01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:49.160]  George Soros pushing this evil agenda.
[01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:59.840]  So today I am proud to announce that the Clinton Global Initiative started by my husband,
[01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:07.360]  will work closely with SEWA and with our partners, the American India Foundation, the
[01:35:07.360 --> 01:35:15.680]  Adrian Arsht, Rockefeller Foundation Resilience Center, the Desai Foundation, the Rockefeller
[01:35:15.680 --> 01:35:25.000]  Foundation, the Council for Inclusive Capitalism, and the Algorand Foundation to launch a 50
[01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:32.480]  million dollar global climate resilient fund for women.
[01:35:32.480 --> 01:35:41.200]  This fund will empower women and your communities to have access to resources that will make
[01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:48.600]  you more resilient to the effects of climate change like extreme heat.
[01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:57.600]  It will also help provide new livelihoods and educational opportunities and provide the
[01:35:57.600 --> 01:36:02.040]  kind of transition we see here today.
[01:36:02.040 --> 01:36:07.480]  If you are using the solar panels to fuel the work in the salt pans, then you take the
[01:36:07.480 --> 01:36:14.000]  solar panels home to provide electricity in your villages and even provide it to the
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:15.000]  grid.
[01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:21.800]  I also want to connect you with global carbon markets so that you...
[01:36:21.800 --> 01:36:30.200]  Yeah, you'll only be able to spend the digital money where they say and it's directly tied
[01:36:30.200 --> 01:36:32.240]  to this global environmental governance.
[01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:34.880]  You can read the whole article with the initiative they're pushing.
[01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:40.640]  It's on infowars.com by Jamie White and it lays out banning cash and bringing in this
[01:36:40.640 --> 01:36:47.800]  new digital system and the good news is humanity is rejecting this.
[01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:50.960]  The bad news is Bill Gates has put in 50 million a week ago.
[01:36:50.960 --> 01:36:54.600]  All these big global foundations are kicking in money to basically force the adoption of
[01:36:54.600 --> 01:36:59.720]  this and already farmers across the world are deciding not to plant crops and being given
[01:36:59.720 --> 01:37:04.200]  carbon money instead which can only be traded on these carbon exchanges so they're trying
[01:37:04.200 --> 01:37:07.040]  to bring these in right now.
[01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:11.560]  Okay, I want to talk about this.
[01:37:11.560 --> 01:37:16.440]  Climate Change Activist goes rogue releasing many volcanoes to cool atmosphere MSN.com
[01:37:16.440 --> 01:37:20.360]  and it's really a group funded by the UN and Bill Gates saying the earth is so bad we need
[01:37:20.360 --> 01:37:26.120]  to do strategic aerosolized spraying with sulfur dioxide and other things in the air
[01:37:26.120 --> 01:37:27.280]  to cool the earth.
[01:37:27.280 --> 01:37:29.360]  Something they've already been doing but it doesn't really cool the earth.
[01:37:29.360 --> 01:37:33.200]  It manipulates weather patterns for total control but they always say, oh, we're bringing
[01:37:33.200 --> 01:37:37.840]  out global cash to society for poor women in Africa, oh, we've got little small groups
[01:37:37.840 --> 01:37:42.680]  creating fake artificial volcanoes to save the earth, tariff farming, geoengineering.
[01:37:42.680 --> 01:37:46.920]  Oh, it's little groups doing it, it's little groups doing it but they give them the money
[01:37:46.920 --> 01:37:51.080]  and they're just the front groups for all this crazy mad scientist control.
[01:37:51.080 --> 01:37:57.200]  Now, let's go back to when oil was just first being discovered and brought forward by the
[01:37:57.200 --> 01:37:59.280]  Rockefellers and others.
[01:37:59.280 --> 01:38:04.040]  I Fletcher Proudy was one of the top kernels who ran black ops and over three more than
[01:38:04.040 --> 01:38:09.080]  a dozen governments in the famous JFK movie that's more like a documentary than a Hollywood
[01:38:09.080 --> 01:38:10.880]  film.
[01:38:10.880 --> 01:38:17.520]  There's a character in there played by Peter Sutherland who's there talking to Jim Garrison.
[01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:20.320]  That's really who gave him how Kennedy was killed and why the movie is so accurate and
[01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:25.160]  why people knew what really happened but Proudy was so smart he was in with the top people
[01:38:25.160 --> 01:38:29.480]  but didn't agree with what they were doing as he got older and went public against it.
[01:38:29.480 --> 01:38:35.200]  Proudy explains why they're telling you oil isn't plentiful when they now know oil oil
[01:38:35.200 --> 01:38:39.000]  is almost everywhere after a few years start filling back up.
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.840]  The earth is just full of it, there's so much of it, it's crazy, it's like they discovered
[01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:45.960]  enough coal to run all the civilization we have for more than 10,000 years and a clean
[01:38:45.960 --> 01:38:46.960]  way to burn it.
[01:38:46.960 --> 01:38:51.120]  So we don't have an energy problem but they want you to think there is an energy problem.
[01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:55.840]  So here's a documentary in the early 1990s that he was in talking about this incredible
[01:38:55.840 --> 01:38:56.840]  reality.
[01:38:56.840 --> 01:39:03.400]  You mentioned in one of your last talks that petroleum wasn't what we thought it was, that
[01:39:03.400 --> 01:39:07.480]  it wasn't a fossil fuel, that it didn't come from fossil animals.
[01:39:07.480 --> 01:39:08.960]  Is it just a mineral?
[01:39:08.960 --> 01:39:12.040]  Is it a mineral like any other mineral?
[01:39:12.040 --> 01:39:19.360]  Is that how it, is that how it, what would you say, how did it, what's the origin of
[01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:20.360]  that?
[01:39:20.360 --> 01:39:26.800]  Well, when they first found petroleum because they were beginning to make motors and needed
[01:39:26.800 --> 01:39:31.240]  on axles or wheels, on railroad trains and all that sort of thing, and remember trains
[01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:38.280]  started in the beginning of the 19th century, then oil went from just a lubricant to a fuel
[01:39:38.280 --> 01:39:41.120]  and it made it valuable.
[01:39:41.120 --> 01:39:45.720]  And Rockefeller happened to be the smartest man in the business at the time, but he made
[01:39:45.720 --> 01:39:50.520]  a lot of, most of his money, much of it off the transport of the petroleum as well as
[01:39:50.520 --> 01:39:51.720]  selling it.
[01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:59.320]  But one thing they realized was if you, because oil is putting a price on oil is like putting
[01:39:59.320 --> 01:40:04.960]  a price on a pail of water, you know, no initial cost is in the ground and in those days they
[01:40:04.960 --> 01:40:10.480]  were some of it almost what you'd call surface mining the oil, they didn't go down deep.
[01:40:10.480 --> 01:40:14.640]  So in order to get the price up, they hit on the idea that they would have to make it
[01:40:14.640 --> 01:40:19.760]  appear to be scarce, that boy, after we take the next few barrels out, we're probably going
[01:40:19.760 --> 01:40:22.320]  to have to close as well, you know, that kind of thing.
[01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:24.880]  A very fructuous event.
[01:40:24.880 --> 01:40:35.800]  In 1892, there was a convention in Geneva of scientists to determine what organic substances
[01:40:35.800 --> 01:40:36.800]  are.
[01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:42.840]  Well, the definition of organic is a substance with hydrogen, oxygen and carbon.
[01:40:42.840 --> 01:40:46.280]  And so it's usually a living substance, a tree.
[01:40:46.280 --> 01:40:52.160]  You analyze a dead tree, hydrogen, carbon and oxygen and grass and so on.
[01:40:52.160 --> 01:40:57.520]  Living things, animals, we are hydrogen, oxygen and carbon.
[01:40:57.520 --> 01:41:04.200]  So at this Geneva convention, Rockefeller took advantage of sending some scientists over
[01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:10.920]  who said oil, petroleum is hydrogen, oxygen and carbon.
[01:41:10.920 --> 01:41:21.720]  Therefore, it must be derived from the, the spoiling, the rotting of formerly living matter.
[01:41:21.720 --> 01:41:27.400]  And playing the game properly, when the, this scientific convention was over, they defined
[01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:32.280]  oil as a residue from formerly living matter.
[01:41:32.280 --> 01:41:36.120]  And he goes on to say in the film, which we all know to be true now, that they did this
[01:41:36.120 --> 01:41:41.640]  to make it sound like oil is artificially running out.
[01:41:41.640 --> 01:41:46.400]  Or it's really running out, but they're really artificially creating scarcity to control
[01:41:46.400 --> 01:41:50.360]  people and they don't give you new technologies that actually bridge it, that are better.
[01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:54.600]  All these battery-driven systems are hundreds of times more toxic with the mining of all
[01:41:54.600 --> 01:41:55.600]  the total nightmares.
[01:41:55.600 --> 01:41:57.920]  That's not denied.
[01:41:57.920 --> 01:42:02.960]  And it's not sustainable, but they want a post-industrial world.
[01:42:02.960 --> 01:42:05.840]  They've been on record, that's what they want.
[01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:09.680]  But the moment we've all got to reach here, and not just our audience and great people,
[01:42:09.680 --> 01:42:13.160]  but those that serve the system, you better learn about how the world really works.
[01:42:13.160 --> 01:42:15.760]  You better learn about the globalist plans you and your family.
[01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:19.000]  You better learn about their master plans and their program for you, and not just sit
[01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:23.000]  there like a spectator, because this system will destroy you and your children.
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:26.200]  We warned you this decades ago, Fletcher Proudy warned you 30, 40 years ago.
[01:42:26.200 --> 01:42:27.960]  He was a top insider.
[01:42:27.960 --> 01:42:30.160]  Now you're living what these people warned us about.
[01:42:30.160 --> 01:42:33.440]  That's how I know all this stuff, people like Fletcher Proudy, he was one of the grand
[01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:37.320]  denny's of it all, exposing the whole agenda, he was at the top level with them, he knows
[01:42:37.320 --> 01:42:39.720]  all of it, he knew all of it.
[01:42:39.720 --> 01:42:42.720]  So you don't get ahead working with these people, you get destroyed.
[01:42:42.720 --> 01:42:47.020]  They always give you little chicken feet to sign on, but it's like mouse cheese on the

[01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:21.960]  I thank you for your past support and I ask you now to count the cost and realize that
[01:44:21.960 --> 01:44:26.760]  only your commitment to keep M4Wars on the air will ensure our victory against the new
[01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:27.760]  old order.
[01:44:27.760 --> 01:44:31.480]  They're coming for you and your family, they're coming for me, they're coming for the children
[01:44:31.480 --> 01:44:34.160]  but to get to the children they've got to get through us first.
[01:44:34.160 --> 01:44:37.720]  These monsters are all over television wanting to give these shots to newborn babies, they're
[01:44:37.720 --> 01:44:42.760]  already given to the pregnant women, miscarriages are off the chart, 80% increase in miscarriages
[01:44:42.760 --> 01:44:46.560]  in the first two prime ministers after these poison shots.
[01:44:46.560 --> 01:44:50.560]  We can and will save the children and they are counting on us.
[01:44:50.560 --> 01:44:51.560]  Let's do it together.
[01:44:51.560 --> 01:44:56.200]  And the fight starts at M4Wars.com and the fight continues with your financial support
[01:44:56.200 --> 01:44:57.200]  at M4WarsStore.com.
[01:44:57.200 --> 01:44:58.200]  Now take action now.
[01:44:58.200 --> 01:44:59.200]  You want to beat the new world order?
[01:44:59.200 --> 01:45:02.200]  You want to stop their globalist agenda?
[01:45:02.200 --> 01:45:07.880]  Well, so do I and I've been the most effective individual in the fight against the globalist
[01:45:07.880 --> 01:45:12.280]  and I've got their number and I know how to bring them down but ladies and gentlemen,
[01:45:12.280 --> 01:45:18.360]  I can't do it without their support and the good news is we're only under about $200,000
[01:45:18.360 --> 01:45:19.360]  a month.
[01:45:19.360 --> 01:45:23.200]  The bad news is the enemy is intensifying their attacks on every front but I'm not going
[01:45:23.200 --> 01:45:26.040]  to back down and I'll never give up but I could give out.
[01:45:26.040 --> 01:45:29.720]  So please keep me on the field, keep me on the front lines against the enemy while getting
[01:45:29.720 --> 01:45:33.200]  great products at the same time that will empower you and your family.
[01:45:33.200 --> 01:45:37.840]  M4WarsStore.com for the best supplements and more or just make a straight donation, big
[01:45:37.840 --> 01:45:42.000]  red banner at the top of M4WarsStore.com and that way all the money goes towards the
[01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:46.160]  fight, not part of it going towards product cost but I thank you all for your support.
[01:45:46.160 --> 01:45:50.320]  Please commit now to go to M4WarsStore.com, get great products and make donations.
[01:45:50.320 --> 01:45:52.600]  I thank you for your support, now take action.
[01:45:52.600 --> 01:45:58.960]  The globalists are counting on you, not taking action.
[01:45:58.960 --> 01:46:01.140]  There is a war on for your mind.
[01:46:01.140 --> 01:46:02.920]  Your mind is a battlefield.
[01:46:02.920 --> 01:46:04.960]  This is an information war.
[01:46:04.960 --> 01:46:10.920]  M4Wars popularized those terms more than two decades ago and today whether it's Donald
[01:46:10.920 --> 01:46:17.760]  Trump or Governor DeSantis or Dr. Robert Malone, they're all using the terms that M4Wars has
[01:46:17.760 --> 01:46:22.480]  popularized because we understand the enemy's operations and we know how to beat them.
[01:46:22.480 --> 01:46:26.560]  But we can't do it without funding and we make it easy to fund with great products and
[01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:29.360]  power you and your immune system and your family as well.
[01:46:29.360 --> 01:46:34.160]  You can also make straight donations at M4WarsStore.com, clicking on the big red banner, a one time
[01:46:34.160 --> 01:46:36.920]  or recurring but I'm asking you to take action.
[01:46:36.920 --> 01:46:40.400]  We're nonviolent but every time you donate money, every time you buy products, every
[01:46:40.400 --> 01:46:44.240]  time you keep us on air, you are literally nonviolently politically punching the New
[01:46:44.240 --> 01:46:48.400]  World Order in the nose, punching their lies in the nose.
[01:46:48.400 --> 01:46:51.840]  We are going to defeat the New World Order, we're going over the top, but right now is
[01:46:51.840 --> 01:47:01.680]  the critical juncture, so please go to M4WarsStore.com and donate now.
[01:47:01.680 --> 01:47:13.120]  Ending of Frontal Assault on the Lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:13.120 --> 01:47:16.920]  Final segment, the Noah and Troyer for two hours covers the news and takes your calls.
[01:47:16.920 --> 01:47:21.560]  Yeah, we're not watching the Super Bowl, folks, because it doesn't matter.
[01:47:21.560 --> 01:47:24.920]  The future matters and we're so close to beating these people, the globalists admit
[01:47:24.920 --> 01:47:29.960]  they're in deep trouble, so I'm not going to sit on my butt while these people win.
[01:47:29.960 --> 01:47:33.720]  I want to thank you all for your support, your word of mouth, and your prayer.
[01:47:33.720 --> 01:47:37.160]  ConspiracyFact.info is just a simple page that has a live feed of my show and Owen's
[01:47:37.160 --> 01:47:39.160]  show and the other great Info War shows.
[01:47:39.160 --> 01:47:45.560]  I suggest you share the link, conspiracyfact.info and of course infowars.com, newswars.com and
[01:47:45.560 --> 01:47:46.560]  band.video.
[01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:51.520]  Not just for my films but in documentaries and reports and live shows, but hundreds of
[01:47:51.520 --> 01:47:57.680]  other band contributors off the internet, you can find them all at band.video.
[01:47:57.680 --> 01:48:01.200]  One exciting thing is, so many of those band people in the last three years, four years
[01:48:01.200 --> 01:48:07.600]  around band.video, get back on Twitter, they're lovingly pushing people back at band.video.
[01:48:07.600 --> 01:48:10.920]  We're getting a ton of traffic from that, saying, hey, see my full report here, see
[01:48:10.920 --> 01:48:14.640]  my channel here, see what we're covering here in case we get banned again.
[01:48:14.640 --> 01:48:16.360]  That is so smart.
[01:48:16.360 --> 01:48:21.400]  Use the big establishment platforms to plug alternative platforms like infowars.com and
[01:48:21.400 --> 01:48:28.400]  rumble and gab and parlor and so many of the other great amazing sites that are there.
[01:48:28.400 --> 01:48:32.640]  I want to air a John Bown compilation you put together from this week's insane Twitter
[01:48:32.640 --> 01:48:33.640]  hearings.
[01:48:33.640 --> 01:48:37.520]  And again, this all goes for the other big tech as well.
[01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:42.880]  Twitter was the lowest level of the big tech, it's still big but it's a little guy on the
[01:48:42.880 --> 01:48:44.480]  totem pole.
[01:48:44.480 --> 01:48:47.960]  Imagine what is in the Facebook documents, well that's coming out in the Google documents
[01:48:47.960 --> 01:48:53.440]  and the Apple documents and the Spotify documents, all that stuff is starting to come out.
[01:48:53.440 --> 01:48:56.440]  So here's this extended report, it doesn't normally do eight and a half minute, nine
[01:48:56.440 --> 01:48:57.440]  minute reports.
[01:48:57.440 --> 01:49:00.240]  We're going to air this report, then we're going to go to break, we're going to come
[01:49:00.240 --> 01:49:03.960]  back with Owen Schreuer and Sunday Night Live, if a local station isn't carrying it, ask
[01:49:03.960 --> 01:49:08.960]  him to, but anybody can find it on the satellite or at infowars.com forward slash show or at
[01:49:08.960 --> 01:49:22.440]  ConspiracyFact.info, so be great info warriors, share that link now, here is John Bown's report.
[01:49:22.440 --> 01:49:26.560]  You solemnly swear or affirm that the testimony you are about to give is the truth, the whole
[01:49:26.560 --> 01:49:30.480]  truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God.
[01:49:30.480 --> 01:49:33.480]  Let the record show that the witness is all entered in the affirmative.
[01:49:33.480 --> 01:49:39.600]  The fired treasonous clowns of Twitter face the truth and their accusers at a Republican
[01:49:39.600 --> 01:49:42.000]  majority house oversight committee.
[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:47.760]  I did not act unlawfully or otherwise inappropriately in any manner with respect to Hunter Biden's
[01:49:47.760 --> 01:49:48.760]  laptop.
[01:49:48.760 --> 01:49:52.240]  While I was at Twitter, the company never lost sight of its deep commitment to promoting
[01:49:52.240 --> 01:49:54.400]  and defending free expression around the world.
[01:49:54.400 --> 01:49:59.200]  In nearly eight years at Twitter, I worked in and led a division called Trust and Safety.
[01:49:59.200 --> 01:50:03.800]  The gray area of this work, though, is when Trust and Safety teams have to make decisions
[01:50:03.800 --> 01:50:10.240]  about so-called lawful but awful material, content that may be legal in many jurisdictions,
[01:50:10.240 --> 01:50:13.400]  but isn't something most people would want to experience.
[01:50:13.400 --> 01:50:18.320]  Unrestricted free speech, paradoxically, results in less speech, not more.
[01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:23.680]  It was our job in Trust and Safety to try to strike an appropriate balance.
[01:50:23.680 --> 01:50:29.520]  Every day, we had to decide whether a particular piece of content equated to yelling fire in
[01:50:29.520 --> 01:50:30.520]  a crowded theater.
[01:50:30.520 --> 01:50:33.840]  Well, Mr. Roth, did you write this tweet?
[01:50:33.840 --> 01:50:38.240]  I regret the language that I used in some of my former tweets, but yes, I did post that.
[01:50:38.240 --> 01:50:42.120]  Yes, that person in the pink hat is clearly a bigger threat to your brand of feminism
[01:50:42.120 --> 01:50:44.760]  than actual Nazis in the White House.
[01:50:44.760 --> 01:50:48.440]  Mr. Roth, do you think all conservatives are Nazis?
[01:50:48.440 --> 01:50:49.440]  Certainly not, sir.
[01:50:49.440 --> 01:50:52.880]  Did Ms. Gaddy or any other lawyer at Twitter ever tell you to take down that tweet?
[01:50:52.880 --> 01:50:57.240]  No, Twitter did not have a practice of restricting employees sharing their personal viewpoints
[01:50:57.240 --> 01:50:58.240]  on the service.
[01:50:58.240 --> 01:51:04.320]  Twitter placed ads from U.S. companies, including Amazon, Disney, McDonald's, and on the Twitter
[01:51:04.320 --> 01:51:09.800]  accounts of the Taliban News Organization, and there are spokespersons and their senior
[01:51:09.800 --> 01:51:12.160]  leaders, Ms. Gaddy.
[01:51:12.160 --> 01:51:19.240]  Did Twitter make money off placed ads on Taliban Twitter accounts on August 26, 2021,
[01:51:19.240 --> 01:51:22.920]  when 13 U.S. men and women died in a suicide bombing?
[01:51:22.920 --> 01:51:25.760]  I have no knowledge of this matter.
[01:51:25.760 --> 01:51:30.440]  Unexpectedly, the hearing experienced a dubious power outage.
[01:51:30.440 --> 01:51:35.720]  When order out of chaos had been restored, Democrats rallied to essentially protect their
[01:51:35.720 --> 01:51:42.360]  donor class cabal in Silicon Valley, no matter the damage or violation it represented towards
[01:51:42.360 --> 01:51:43.360]  the Republic.
[01:51:43.360 --> 01:51:46.520]  And we should be talking about the threats to our democracy.
[01:51:46.520 --> 01:51:50.240]  That's the real threat, not an old article that seemingly couldn't reach the viewership
[01:51:50.240 --> 01:51:55.600]  it sought through its own platform to disparage and attempt to skew the election in favor
[01:51:55.600 --> 01:52:00.520]  of a twice impeached former president who lost a secure and fair election.
[01:52:00.520 --> 01:52:05.880]  You stated that Donald Trump described his own tweets as little missiles.
[01:52:05.880 --> 01:52:08.800]  Why did that stick in your mind?
[01:52:08.800 --> 01:52:15.000]  Yes, the quote that you're referring to, I don't remember exactly what news article
[01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:19.200]  that it was in, but it was a news article that I had read in which the former president
[01:52:19.200 --> 01:52:23.680]  said that he liked to send out his tweets like little missiles.
[01:52:23.680 --> 01:52:29.360]  To me, that sounded exactly like weaponization of a platform in his own words, and yet Twitter
[01:52:29.360 --> 01:52:31.040]  was not concerned.
[01:52:31.040 --> 01:52:35.520]  Free speech is about the government limiting speech about the public.
[01:52:35.520 --> 01:52:38.120]  My governor, Rhonda Sanchez, is doing that right now.
[01:52:38.120 --> 01:52:42.200]  I have a venue in my district that he's revoking the liquor license of trying to close because
[01:52:42.200 --> 01:52:43.200]  they had a drag show.
[01:52:43.200 --> 01:52:46.200]  They want the ability to inject this again.
[01:52:46.200 --> 01:52:50.160]  So they've dragged a social media platform here in Congress.
[01:52:50.160 --> 01:52:54.400]  They're weaponizing the use of this committee so that they can do it again.
[01:52:54.400 --> 01:52:58.280]  We can be talking about abortion rights, civil rights, voting rights, but instead we're talking
[01:52:58.280 --> 01:53:02.120]  about Hunter Biden's half-fake laptop story.
[01:53:02.120 --> 01:53:08.560]  While Republicans bore down on the ugly truth, uncovering layers of manipulation via deep
[01:53:08.560 --> 01:53:12.880]  state unleashing its control over American free speech.
[01:53:12.880 --> 01:53:20.360]  The reason that we've had this hearing is because the laptop has been mislabeled by
[01:53:20.360 --> 01:53:24.800]  media in the mainstream media as being Russian disinformation.
[01:53:24.800 --> 01:53:29.800]  Apparently the views of a Stanford doctor are disinformation to you people.
[01:53:29.800 --> 01:53:35.000]  So my first question this morning of Ms. Gadding, may I ask of you, where did you go to medical
[01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.320]  school?
[01:53:37.320 --> 01:53:38.600]  I did not go to medical school.
[01:53:38.600 --> 01:53:39.600]  I'm sorry?
[01:53:39.600 --> 01:53:40.600]  I did not go to medical school.
[01:53:40.600 --> 01:53:41.600]  That's what I thought.
[01:53:41.600 --> 01:53:46.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, interfered with the United States of America 2020 presidential
[01:53:46.480 --> 01:53:49.760]  election knowingly and willingly.
[01:53:49.760 --> 01:53:50.760]  That's the bad news.
[01:53:50.760 --> 01:53:55.280]  It's going to get worse because this is the investigation part.
[01:53:55.280 --> 01:53:57.440]  Later comes the arrest part.
[01:53:57.440 --> 01:54:03.760]  As the questioning continued, the ex-executives gradually revealed that either they were lying
[01:54:03.760 --> 01:54:09.120]  to Congress, which could land them each up to five years in prison, or the real culprits
[01:54:09.120 --> 01:54:13.600]  behind the scenes had not yet been called as witnesses.
[01:54:13.600 --> 01:54:16.760]  Who advocated for the removal of the New York Post story?
[01:54:16.760 --> 01:54:19.320]  The company's decision to treat it as a violation.
[01:54:19.320 --> 01:54:23.120]  Mr. Roth, who at the company actually went over your recommendation?
[01:54:23.120 --> 01:54:25.320]  Because you're pretty high up.
[01:54:25.320 --> 01:54:27.080]  Who overrode you?
[01:54:27.080 --> 01:54:29.520]  The decision was communicated to me by my direct supervisor.
[01:54:29.520 --> 01:54:30.920]  Who was that person?
[01:54:30.920 --> 01:54:32.120]  Her name was Del Harvey.
[01:54:32.120 --> 01:54:38.520]  Mr. Matt Tiaby, a respected reporter who published much of the Twitter file, said, quote, Twitter's
[01:54:38.520 --> 01:54:44.760]  contact with FBI was constant and pervasive as if it were a subsidiary.
[01:54:44.760 --> 01:54:49.360]  Now, I want to better understand why he would suggest that.
[01:54:49.360 --> 01:54:54.720]  Mr. Roth, while at Twitter, how many meetings did you have with the FBI?
[01:54:54.720 --> 01:54:57.480]  I couldn't say for sure, but I would say more than 10.
[01:54:57.480 --> 01:54:59.640]  That's a reasonable estimate.
[01:54:59.640 --> 01:55:00.880]  I couldn't say for sure.
[01:55:00.880 --> 01:55:07.120]  And as CNN and others celebrated the Democrats' position, it became abundantly clear that
[01:55:07.120 --> 01:55:12.320]  there is no end in sight for the Democrats and Mockingbird Media's campaign of learned
[01:55:12.320 --> 01:55:16.960]  helplessness, foisted upon the American people.
[01:55:16.960 --> 01:55:23.160]  Republican Representative Anna Luna's smackdown rewarded her with a sloppy propaganda hit piece
[01:55:23.160 --> 01:55:29.800]  hastily thrown together by the Mockingbird Media CIA hub, The Washington Post.
[01:55:29.800 --> 01:55:32.520]  Their undertone of their article was incredibly racist.
[01:55:32.520 --> 01:55:35.280]  They tried to undercut my Hispanic heritage.
[01:55:35.280 --> 01:55:38.480]  They even spoke to my mother and did a report of a lot of what she was posting.
[01:55:38.480 --> 01:55:41.800]  So The Washington Post is compost and they should do better.
[01:55:41.800 --> 01:55:45.560]  Can you explain to me why the federal government would ever have interest in communicating
[01:55:45.560 --> 01:55:51.400]  through JIRA, mind you, a private cloud server with social media companies without oversight
[01:55:51.400 --> 01:55:53.200]  to censor American voices?
[01:55:53.200 --> 01:55:57.720]  I want to let you know that this is a violation of the First Amendment and the federal government
[01:55:57.720 --> 01:56:00.720]  is colluding with social media companies to censor Americans.
[01:56:00.720 --> 01:56:06.880]  A screenshot behind me, which is an example of one of thousands shows on November 3, 2020
[01:56:06.880 --> 01:56:12.040]  that you, Mr. Roth, a Twitter employee were exchanging communications on JIRA, a private
[01:56:12.040 --> 01:56:19.360]  cloud server with CISA, NASS, NASED, and Alex Stamas, who now works at Stanford and is
[01:56:19.360 --> 01:56:25.560]  a former security officer at Facebook to remove a posting.
[01:56:25.560 --> 01:56:30.320]  Do you now remember communicating on a private cloud server to remove a posting?
[01:56:30.320 --> 01:56:33.400]  I wouldn't agree with the characterization that this...
[01:56:33.400 --> 01:56:34.400]  I don't care if you agree.
[01:56:34.400 --> 01:56:35.400]  This is your stuff.
[01:56:35.400 --> 01:56:40.760]  Yes or no, did you communicate with a private entity, the government agency, on a private
[01:56:40.760 --> 01:56:41.760]  cloud server?
[01:56:41.760 --> 01:56:42.760]  Yes or no?
[01:56:42.760 --> 01:56:43.760]  The question was if I...
[01:56:43.760 --> 01:56:44.760]  Yes or no?
[01:56:44.760 --> 01:56:45.760]  Yeah, I'm on time.
[01:56:45.760 --> 01:56:46.760]  Yes or no?
[01:56:46.760 --> 01:56:47.760]  Ma'am, I don't believe I can give you a yes or no.
[01:56:47.760 --> 01:56:51.320]  Well, I'm going to tell you right now that you did and we have proof of it.
[01:56:51.320 --> 01:56:54.320]  Chairman, point of order.
[01:56:54.320 --> 01:56:58.880]  Yeah, I just want to call it to the attention of the chair and members.
[01:56:58.880 --> 01:57:03.040]  I feel like, yes, you're getting awfully close to witness intimidation.
[01:57:03.040 --> 01:57:06.400]  What is the committee's policy around threatening a witness?
[01:57:06.400 --> 01:57:13.200]  Around the rules of decorum, can we agree that threatening a witness comes close to broaching
[01:57:13.200 --> 01:57:14.280]  general decorum?
[01:57:14.280 --> 01:57:19.200]  It does broach general decorum of the committee?
[01:57:19.200 --> 01:57:23.960]  With all due respect, Mr. Casio, of course, we don't agree that there was any witness
[01:57:23.960 --> 01:57:25.200]  threatening.
[01:57:25.200 --> 01:57:32.000]  Meanwhile, a myriad of websites suspiciously went down simultaneously on the day of this
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:33.280]  Twitter hearing.
[01:57:33.280 --> 01:57:38.720]  Was it possible that somewhere someone was very nervous and that a blow had been struck
[01:57:38.720 --> 01:57:41.960]  against the hull of the New World Order?
[01:57:41.960 --> 01:57:43.120]  John Bowne reporting.
[01:57:43.120 --> 01:57:58.360]  Diet Force is amazing, I'm 45 and I have bits, I go to the gym and I have bits that won't
[01:57:58.360 --> 01:58:06.200]  move and Diet Force has helped me move those bits like under my pecs, my belly, I'm just
[01:58:06.200 --> 01:58:13.080]  taking Diet Force two tablets a day, man, if you're struggling to get chip shape for
[01:58:13.080 --> 01:58:19.640]  the ladies, Diet Force is the go, you have to get the Diet Force and have it to a day
[01:58:19.640 --> 01:58:21.160]  and just keep acting.

[01:58:28.440 --> 01:58:29.440]  Diet Force.

[01:58:31.840 --> 01:58:33.880]  Thank you so much for the call, Grant.

[01:58:50.320 --> 01:58:55.240]  I have been in a 28 year marathon battle with a globalist.
[01:58:55.240 --> 01:59:01.760]  I have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics, not just in America but the world.
[01:59:01.760 --> 01:59:07.280]  We are engaging the globalist at point blank range in the information war, but I don't
[01:59:07.280 --> 01:59:08.280]  deserve the credit.
[01:59:08.280 --> 01:59:13.240]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support them forward for the real
[01:59:13.240 --> 01:59:18.880]  reason we've had this success, we're having now the greatest victories in the fight against
[01:59:18.880 --> 01:59:21.200]  the new order we've ever had.
[01:59:21.200 --> 01:59:27.920]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon and that's why today it's more important
[01:59:27.920 --> 01:59:31.880]  than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the
[01:59:31.880 --> 01:59:34.760]  efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them.
[01:59:34.760 --> 01:59:35.760]  God bless you all.
[01:59:35.760 --> 01:59:36.760]  I salute you.
[01:59:36.760 --> 01:59:37.760]  I thank you.
[01:59:37.760 --> 01:59:42.760]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and this
[01:59:42.760 --> 01:59:44.260]  week is happening.
[01:59:44.260 --> 01:59:45.600]  The fight is my fight.
[01:59:45.600 --> 01:59:46.600]  It's your fight.
[01:59:46.600 --> 01:59:47.600]  It's our fight.
[01:59:47.600 --> 01:59:50.360]  God bless you all.
[01:59:50.360 --> 01:59:56.600]  Leading of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
