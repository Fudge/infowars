[00:00:04.977 --> 00:00:06.277]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.277 --> 00:00:08.057]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.057 --> 00:00:09.818]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.818 --> 00:00:11.398]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.398 --> 00:00:12.938]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.938 --> 00:00:17.139]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.139 --> 00:00:21.220]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.616 --> 00:00:32.898]  We are live.
[00:00:32.898 --> 00:00:37.584]  It is April 12th, 2011 on this live Tuesday edition.
[00:00:37.584 --> 00:00:44.194]  On screen for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers is the front page of the Drudge Report.
[00:00:45.253 --> 00:00:53.540]  Yesterday afternoon we posted a new video that surfaced yesterday afternoon that was shot in just the last few days.
[00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.885]  Six-year-old girl groped then drug-tested by TSA.
[00:00:58.885 --> 00:01:03.969]  We sent the story to Drudge and I'm glad that he linked to the YouTube video.
[00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:08.132]  Six-year-old girl groped then drug-tested by TSA.
[00:01:08.132 --> 00:01:10.394]  We've got the new video plus a
[00:01:11.255 --> 00:01:11.855]  We're good to go.
[00:01:25.874 --> 00:01:41.540]  And this morning, I was on Coast to Coast AM last night, and this morning when I got up, my wife hadn't seen it yet, and sometimes we have slight debates about the fact that I don't want to fly with the children, and she concurs, but then she says, but I still want to travel.
[00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:42.881]  We never go anywhere.
[00:01:42.881 --> 00:01:45.162]  And I said, here, watch this.
[00:01:45.162 --> 00:01:52.705]  What would happen if they tried to do this to one of our children, our three-year-old, our six-year-old daughters, our eight-year-old son?
[00:01:52.705 --> 00:01:55.146]  And she said, that's right, we better not fly.
[00:01:56.897 --> 00:02:08.364]  I have had TSA security try to do this to me one time and I got very angry and told them no way and in that case they left me alone.
[00:02:08.364 --> 00:02:08.905]  Other people
[00:02:09.844 --> 00:02:20.286]  They will tell them, leave the airport then, and they then trigger a law, a federal regulation, and charge you with an $11,000 fine.
[00:02:20.286 --> 00:02:23.746]  Kind of like public schools say, oh, you won't take the vaccines?
[00:02:23.746 --> 00:02:25.387]  We're gonna kick you out.
[00:02:25.387 --> 00:02:28.507]  And then we're gonna charge you with truancy for not being in school.
[00:02:28.507 --> 00:02:34.068]  There's no law to take vaccines, but they all do it through deceptive, criminal manipulation.
[00:02:34.068 --> 00:02:38.769]  So, you won't let us stick our hands down your pants or fondle your one-year-old or your six-year-old?
[00:02:39.997 --> 00:02:41.419]  Get out of here!
[00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:43.321]  We're your master!
[00:02:43.321 --> 00:02:47.265]  And then you leave, and then they charge you later.
[00:02:47.265 --> 00:02:49.128]  This is how the criminal mind works.
[00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:51.530]  Goons.
[00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:52.791]  Not even trained.
[00:02:52.791 --> 00:02:54.152]  Not sworn peace officers.
[00:02:54.152 --> 00:02:56.494]  A sworn peace officer can't do this type of stuff.
[00:02:56.494 --> 00:02:58.535]  We've got district attorneys on to break that down.
[00:02:58.535 --> 00:02:59.796]  This is criminal.
[00:02:59.796 --> 00:03:01.217]  But the feds don't care.
[00:03:01.217 --> 00:03:02.998]  They don't care how angry you get.
[00:03:02.998 --> 00:03:05.160]  They don't care if this hurts the airlines.
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.781]  This is about breaking your will.
[00:03:07.781 --> 00:03:09.523]  And all over the country,
[00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:18.136]  The federal government is lobbying and promising billions of dollars per major state, hundreds of millions for smaller states.
[00:03:18.136 --> 00:03:22.399]  They're promising Texas several billion dollars in highway funds.
[00:03:22.399 --> 00:03:33.408]  Just like they say, the feds say what the speed limit is and if the state doesn't agree you don't get the money, they're saying Texas had better pass warrantless checkpoints or you won't get your money.
[00:03:34.733 --> 00:03:35.033]  And here's
[00:03:52.932 --> 00:03:53.092]  Well,
[00:04:14.997 --> 00:04:25.442]  The citizens have the book literally dropped on us and we have the biggest prison population in the world and now, since it came out yesterday in the Chicago Tribune,
[00:04:26.837 --> 00:04:31.539]  That multiple school districts in Chicago do not allow parents to pack any lunch.
[00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:33.760]  Not bananas, not grapes, not spinach.
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:34.800]  Nothing!
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.421]  Because you can't be trusted.
[00:04:36.421 --> 00:04:39.122]  They actually said, parents can't be trusted.
[00:04:39.122 --> 00:04:41.623]  So they're going to put their hands down your children's pants.
[00:04:41.623 --> 00:04:43.543]  They're not going to let you pack their lunch.
[00:04:43.543 --> 00:04:44.864]  You are a prisoner.
[00:04:44.864 --> 00:04:50.726]  You're here to biologically supply them a new slave who will probably be trained how to submit to slavery.
[00:04:50.726 --> 00:04:52.067]  This is slavery induction.
[00:04:53.167 --> 00:04:57.371]  We're gonna get into the latest Fukushima, it's huge, the economy, it's all coming up.
[00:04:57.371 --> 00:05:01.174]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.174 --> 00:05:16.647]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:05:16.647 --> 00:05:20.331]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:05:21.331 --> 00:05:34.103]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:05:34.103 --> 00:05:41.370]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:05:42.051 --> 00:05:52.424]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[00:05:52.424 --> 00:05:56.349]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[00:05:56.349 --> 00:05:59.473]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[00:06:00.054 --> 00:06:04.596]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:06:04.596 --> 00:06:05.516]  Number 1.
[00:06:05.516 --> 00:06:08.937]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:06:08.937 --> 00:06:09.797]  Number 2.
[00:06:09.797 --> 00:06:14.679]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:06:14.679 --> 00:06:15.419]  It's true.
[00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:20.301]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:06:20.301 --> 00:06:21.121]  Number 3.
[00:06:21.121 --> 00:06:24.703]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:06:24.703 --> 00:06:28.404]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:06:28.624 --> 00:06:29.424]  Number 4.
[00:06:29.424 --> 00:06:32.165]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:06:32.165 --> 00:06:35.846]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:06:35.846 --> 00:06:36.646]  Number 5.
[00:06:36.646 --> 00:06:40.787]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:06:40.787 --> 00:06:45.849]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:06:45.849 --> 00:06:50.010]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:51.811]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:06:51.811 --> 00:06:56.412]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-866-422-9000.
[00:06:59.834 --> 00:07:03.655]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[00:07:03.655 --> 00:07:07.938]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[00:07:07.938 --> 00:07:12.660]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:18.583]  Not looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[00:07:18.583 --> 00:07:25.586]  Not worried about them moving south, closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[00:07:28.377 --> 00:07:33.899]  I'm looking for America.
[00:07:33.899 --> 00:07:35.240]  Wear American and be proud.
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:38.301]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[00:07:38.301 --> 00:07:42.643]  Land I left free in the home of the brave.
[00:07:42.643 --> 00:07:46.985]  Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone.
[00:07:54.324 --> 00:08:00.808]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[00:08:00.808 --> 00:08:03.590]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:06.372]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:30.987 --> 00:08:33.791]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:33.791 --> 00:08:35.453]  Again, it is Tuesday.
[00:08:35.453 --> 00:08:41.020]  It is the 12th day of April, 2011.
[00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:46.086]  And coming up in the last 40 minutes of the next hour, Dr. Bob Bowman, nuclear physicist,
[00:08:46.687 --> 00:08:49.628]  We'll be joining us to discuss Fukushima.
[00:08:49.628 --> 00:09:10.294]  They are now telling the world what we knew more than three weeks ago, and what we broke down here more than three weeks ago, just a week or so into the disaster, that this is as bad as Chernobyl, or many times worse, as Dr. Christopher Busby has stated, one of the leading radiation crises researchers in Europe.
[00:09:10.294 --> 00:09:14.436]  He'll also be joining us coming up for 30 minutes in the third hour today.
[00:09:15.606 --> 00:09:19.810]  I hate to be right, but governments always tend to act the same.
[00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:25.416]  They engage in deception, they engage in manipulation, and here's the big news flash.
[00:09:25.416 --> 00:09:36.506]  All over the United States, in milk, in water supplies, now they're picking up higher and higher levels of radiation, and as you know, the EPA's response to this is to say, let us
[00:09:37.407 --> 00:09:40.169]  Not eat cake, let us drink and eat radiation.
[00:09:40.169 --> 00:09:44.412]  They're just raising the levels that they say are safe.
[00:09:44.412 --> 00:09:52.177]  This is because a criminal culture of denial has seeped into every level of government in this country.
[00:09:52.657 --> 00:09:57.020]  We're going to be going over all of that today.
[00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:03.565]  In fact, here is just some of those headlines, but we'll get into it in great detail with Dr. Bob Bowman and Dr. Christopher Busby.
[00:10:03.565 --> 00:10:07.828]  Christopher Busby, of course, is a chemical physicist.
[00:10:07.828 --> 00:10:17.235]  Dr. Bob Bowman has three degrees in nuclear physics and aeronautics and is the former head of the Star Wars weapons system program.
[00:10:17.235 --> 00:10:19.417]  Going through some of these headlines, Fukushima,
[00:10:20.563 --> 00:10:23.687]  Introduces deadly strontium into the environment.
[00:10:23.687 --> 00:10:29.213]  Japan ups nuke crisis severity to match Chernobyl as a number 7.
[00:10:29.213 --> 00:10:34.139]  Nuclear crises are listed from a 1 to a 7, 7 being the worst known crises.
[00:10:34.139 --> 00:10:36.822]  Again, here's CNBC.
[00:10:36.822 --> 00:10:39.345]  Japan raises nuclear crisis to same level as Chernobyl.
[00:10:40.306 --> 00:10:42.007]  Here's another story out of Reuters.
[00:10:42.007 --> 00:10:47.389]  Slight amounts of strontium found near crippled Japan nuclear power plant.
[00:10:47.389 --> 00:10:48.630]  Here's another headline.
[00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:54.592]  TEPCO wary of Fukushima radiation leak exceeding Chernobyl.
[00:10:54.592 --> 00:10:56.093]  And they're back with moralizing.
[00:10:56.093 --> 00:10:59.214]  Well, it's listed as bad as Chernobyl, but we've only released 10%.
[00:11:00.675 --> 00:11:01.656]  As much as Chernobyl.
[00:11:20.851 --> 00:11:20.931]  And
[00:11:38.285 --> 00:11:43.067]  I mean, we could see them being ejected when Reactor 3 blew up with that mushroom cloud 3,000 feet in the air.
[00:11:43.067 --> 00:11:44.927]  And I said, those look like fuel rods.
[00:11:44.927 --> 00:11:49.229]  And I had nuclear experts on and said, yes, those appear to be fuel rods.
[00:11:49.229 --> 00:11:57.852]  And the Japanese government responded by burying them on the spot, wherever they found them, with dirt.
[00:11:57.852 --> 00:12:00.793]  Forgot to turn my cell phone off.
[00:12:00.793 --> 00:12:01.733]  Will you guys kill that?
[00:12:01.733 --> 00:12:06.275]  Sorry, I normally have the phone off, but it's going off on me in here.
[00:12:07.714 --> 00:12:20.964]  So continuing with this information, here's another headline from Natural News, and they have links to the government's own reporting systems.
[00:12:20.964 --> 00:12:23.426]  Fukushima radiation taints U.S.
[00:12:23.426 --> 00:12:26.649]  milk supplies at levels 300% higher than EPA maximums.
[00:12:30.672 --> 00:12:39.795]  But the issue here is, depending on what type of radioactive isotope, they've raised the different isotopes from 1,000 times safe levels to 24,000 plus times, almost 25,000 times safe levels.
[00:12:39.795 --> 00:12:42.996]  And so their response is to simply raise the levels.
[00:12:51.969 --> 00:12:56.237]  And of course it's come out now in ABC News, as a listener pointed out yesterday, and we pulled it up.
[00:12:56.237 --> 00:12:59.102]  In fact, will you guys print me that ABC News article?
[00:12:59.102 --> 00:13:00.205]  You just searched the term.
[00:13:02.788 --> 00:13:04.389]  Semi Valley Meltdown.
[00:13:04.389 --> 00:13:05.850]  You'll get ABC News.
[00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:18.960]  They've just now decided to tell us that there was a reactor, the first power reactor in the US in the early 1950s that completely melted down and they kept it secret from the public and radiated that area.
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:22.803]  Here are the numbers from the state governments collated.
[00:13:23.684 --> 00:13:24.605]  By Natural News.
[00:13:24.605 --> 00:13:29.989]  Again, this is up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com by Ethan A. Huff.
[00:13:29.989 --> 00:13:32.230]  And this is the numbers.
[00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:40.276]  Los Angeles, California has highly elevated levels of different radioactive isotopes.
[00:13:40.276 --> 00:13:41.817]  Iodine 131, Cesium 134, Cesium 137.
[00:13:48.371 --> 00:13:49.892]  And it gives you the numbers.
[00:13:49.892 --> 00:13:51.453]  Los Angeles, California, 0.39.
[00:13:51.453 --> 00:13:55.475]  And then it gives the different isotopes that have been found.
[00:13:55.475 --> 00:14:03.519]  Philadelphia, Baxter, Pennsylvania, 0.46 of cesium.
[00:14:03.519 --> 00:14:06.300]  Philadelphia, Belmont, Pennsylvania, 1.3 of cesium.
[00:14:12.557 --> 00:14:14.238]  People keep sending me emails saying it's cesium.
[00:14:14.238 --> 00:14:17.021]  There's cesium and cesium, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:17.021 --> 00:14:34.515]  Continuing, Muscle Shoals, Alabama, Niagara Falls, New York, Denver, Colorado, Detroit, Michigan, East Liverpool, Ohio, Trenton, New Jersey, Painesville, Ohio, Columbia, Pennsylvania, Oak Ridge, Tennessee.
[00:14:34.515 --> 00:14:36.457]  And it just goes through all these levels.
[00:14:36.457 --> 00:14:39.359]  Richmond, Washington, Boise, Idaho, Chattanooga, Tennessee.
[00:14:41.069 --> 00:14:51.378]  Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Cincinnati, Ohio, Watertown, New Jersey, Helena, Montana, and these are coming out of state agencies and being collated.
[00:14:51.378 --> 00:15:06.370]  The feds are not releasing numbers, they're not testing, and the mainstream media is basically playing along with all of this to not report on what's going on.
[00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:07.231]  So we're going to be
[00:15:09.028 --> 00:15:11.675]  Breaking all of that down today as well.
[00:15:16.053 --> 00:15:18.614]  And here is the ABC News headline.
[00:15:18.614 --> 00:15:24.336]  Decades later, Simi Valley nuclear meltdown still impacts lives.
[00:15:24.336 --> 00:15:29.197]  This is out of KABC there in Southern California.
[00:15:29.197 --> 00:15:35.639]  In 1959, a 2,900-acre California plant suffered a massive nuclear meltdown.
[00:15:35.639 --> 00:15:37.440]  It remains the worst in U.S.
[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.621]  history for the radiation that was released.
[00:15:39.621 --> 00:15:43.302]  The accident at Santa Susana Field Laboratory
[00:15:44.736 --> 00:15:55.784]  Or Rocketdyne, as it was known previously, left large rates of toxic contamination, radiation, and chemicals in Simi Valley and Los Angeles County neighborhoods.
[00:15:55.784 --> 00:16:02.228]  And then it just goes in to break down how for decades they kept it secret from the public.
[00:16:02.228 --> 00:16:08.152]  So it's standard default position.
[00:16:08.152 --> 00:16:10.674]  When there's an emergency, when there's a crisis,
[00:16:11.533 --> 00:16:25.712]  That the system cannot and will not help you and they will lie to you and then they will do everything they can to make sure that you don't learn about the crises so that you can avert the danger yourself because they don't want any liabilities.
[00:16:26.653 --> 00:16:30.154]  They want to continue to build these dangerous reactors.
[00:16:30.154 --> 00:16:46.240]  They want to continue to mine phosphate for fertilizer production and take the byproduct, a toxic mix of sodium fluoride, arsenic, lead, mercury, uranium, and other radioactive isotopes and dump it in your water.
[00:16:47.153 --> 00:17:00.683]  And then when the state agencies test the water in Texas and Alabama and other states and say, well, we've got 10 to 100 times safe levels of radioactive isotopes in the drinking water added to it, the Fed's answer is cover it up.
[00:17:00.683 --> 00:17:04.166]  And that, of course, I've been talking a lot about the last three months since that came out.
[00:17:04.166 --> 00:17:09.510]  We talked about them mining the phosphate that had radioactive isotopes previously and gone over those documents.
[00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:12.993]  But now it's clear that they're covering it up and continuing.
[00:17:13.533 --> 00:17:23.237]  Because the policy is to add these radioactive isotopes not only to the water, because it creates massive cancers and massive infertility.
[00:17:23.237 --> 00:17:26.958]  And I saw another headline yesterday with government numbers.
[00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:33.480]  The sperm count is accelerating its drop from 87 to now close to 90%.
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:42.584]  And if this continues, it's estimated that almost all males will be completely sterile by 2025 in the United States, in Europe, in England.
[00:17:43.643 --> 00:17:45.428]  Globalist mission complete!
[00:17:45.428 --> 00:17:46.431]  And this is not an issue!
[00:17:47.975 --> 00:17:58.538]  Oh no, they've got to have surveillance blimps and surveillance aircraft and the cops training your kids how to be spies and roadside checkpoints to quote stop drunk drivers really train you to accept checkpoints.
[00:17:58.538 --> 00:18:08.260]  The TSA's got to stick their hands down your pants because you've got a lesser chance of a terrorist killing you than dying from a bee sting from an allergic response.
[00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:12.821]  You've got a better chance of dying from peanut allergies than being killed by terrorists.
[00:18:12.821 --> 00:18:15.102]  Those reports have been written, those numbers have been documented.
[00:18:15.953 --> 00:18:17.093]  They don't care.
[00:18:17.093 --> 00:18:26.757]  It's all about, but isn't a scary man with a beard, isn't it fun to get scared and beg the government to have men in black uniforms come take care of you?
[00:18:26.757 --> 00:18:33.760]  Isn't it fun to have all these cameras surveilling you and controlling you?
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:40.163]  So, that's just some of the news and reports that we have on that front.
[00:18:41.591 --> 00:18:59.968]  Also on the economy, you know over the weekend George Soros told Bloomberg, we played the clip yesterday, that the dollar is already not the world reserve currency and is being phased out and that that was the consensus developed by the private and government banker heads at the Bretton Woods meeting in New Hampshire over the weekend.
[00:19:01.013 --> 00:19:06.574]  And he's continued by telling the news that the country could actually absorb more debt.
[00:19:06.574 --> 00:19:07.855]  Well, of course.
[00:19:07.855 --> 00:19:24.439]  He gets the free insider trading fiat instruments for nothing, and then he induces government minions to go deeper into debt to his system and his coterie system.
[00:19:26.772 --> 00:19:41.060]  He gets the world for free so of course you can absorb more debt and Ron Paul has come out and pointed out that of the 37 to 40 billion that was cut those were cuts that had already been agreed on last year.
[00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:46.125]  And that most of it was just leftover money and things from highway projects.
[00:19:46.125 --> 00:19:48.087]  And that nothing's being changed.
[00:19:48.087 --> 00:19:50.710]  They're just manipulating the numbers.
[00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:54.034]  Because that's what the Republican and Democratic leadership want.
[00:19:54.034 --> 00:19:55.535]  They're not screwing up.
[00:19:55.535 --> 00:19:57.137]  They want you to drink uranium.
[00:19:57.137 --> 00:19:58.819]  They want you to be bankrupt.
[00:19:58.819 --> 00:20:00.181]  They want to bankrupt the country.
[00:20:00.621 --> 00:20:07.563]  Iodine Protection Packs from HempUSA.org are now in stock for immediate delivery worldwide.

[00:20:30.071 --> 00:20:39.397]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:20:39.397 --> 00:20:40.198]  This capitalism?
[00:20:40.198 --> 00:20:46.442]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:20:46.442 --> 00:20:47.323]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:20:47.323 --> 00:20:50.585]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.
[00:20:50.585 --> 00:20:51.385]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[00:20:51.385 --> 00:20:52.466]  It's time to understand the system.
[00:20:52.466 --> 00:20:53.106]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:53.106 --> 00:20:53.387]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:21:03.034 --> 00:21:05.355]  Alex Jones here with key information.
[00:21:05.355 --> 00:21:05.936]  The U.S.
[00:21:05.936 --> 00:21:13.222]  government is a Ponzi scheme that relies on the Treasury continuously selling large amounts of government bonds to foreign central banks.
[00:21:13.222 --> 00:21:15.924]  With Japan about to become a seller of U.S.
[00:21:15.924 --> 00:21:19.267]  bonds in order to rebuild its own nation, and the U.S.
[00:21:19.267 --> 00:21:25.912]  antagonizing China by calling them currency manipulators, the Federal Reserve, which is already buying about 70% of U.S.
[00:21:25.912 --> 00:21:28.555]  Treasuries, will soon be the only buyer left of U.S.
[00:21:28.555 --> 00:21:29.015]  Treasuries.
[00:21:29.415 --> 00:21:32.918]  Our friends at the National Inflation Association believe that the U.S.
[00:21:32.918 --> 00:21:38.863]  dollar will soon become worthless and Americans will see the purchasing power of their incomes and savings destroyed.
[00:21:38.863 --> 00:21:47.331]  I strongly urge my fellow Americans to sign up for the free NIA newsletter at www.inflation.us.
[00:21:47.331 --> 00:21:56.699]  If you are sick and tired of the economic propaganda in the mainstream media, sign up for free at inflation.us to learn the economic truth that the mainstream media ignores.
[00:21:59.494 --> 00:22:06.157]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:22:06.157 --> 00:22:14.280]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:22.103]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:22:22.443 --> 00:22:27.527]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:22:27.527 --> 00:22:32.751]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:22:32.751 --> 00:22:37.095]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:22:37.095 --> 00:22:38.196]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:38.196 --> 00:22:42.700]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:47.604]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[00:22:47.604 --> 00:22:50.106]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[00:22:52.347 --> 00:22:52.667]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:52.667 --> 00:22:52.787]  $349, $359, $379.

[00:24:03.718 --> 00:24:16.112]  I hear the train a-comin' It's rollin' around the bend And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when I'm stuck in Folsom Prison
[00:24:19.256 --> 00:24:24.059]  During the break, Jaron was asking, hey, have any of the Fukushima 50 gotten sick?
[00:24:24.059 --> 00:24:25.520]  And I said, search it.
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:39.310]  And there is the Daily Mail out of England with the headline, three of Fukushima 50 rushed to hospital with radiation poisoning as panicked Tokyo residents clear shop shelves of bottled water.
[00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:41.411]  That was from a couple weeks ago on March 24th.
[00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:50.417]  Of course, the director of the plant has been in and out of the hospital, but they won't ever really say why.
[00:24:50.417 --> 00:24:53.780]  Undoubtedly, Japan admittedly has engaged in a cover-up.
[00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:58.304]  The governor of that state, the prefecture of Fukushima, has said there's been a cover-up.
[00:24:59.165 --> 00:25:16.999]  And we've been trying to translate and go over the local Japanese news, and there have been some reports of people with red faces and vomiting, but when you've got the Japanese government covering up, when you've got our government raising safe radiation levels, this is a big, big deal.
[00:25:16.999 --> 00:25:26.226]  And it shows how these bureaucrats think we're stupid, that they can just raise safe radiation levels, and then it's out of sight, out of mind, and oh, it is as bad as
[00:25:27.622 --> 00:25:34.864]  What happened at Chernobyl, but it's not as bad as what happened at Chernobyl.
[00:25:34.864 --> 00:25:39.005]  All right, that said, I want to get into the TSA.
[00:25:39.005 --> 00:25:46.147]  If you go up to Infowars.com, we posted this yesterday afternoon, and then the Drudge Report picked it up today.
[00:25:46.147 --> 00:25:51.489]  Six-year-old girl groped, then drug-tested by TSA.
[00:25:51.489 --> 00:25:52.389]  And Drudge has the big,
[00:25:53.209 --> 00:26:03.791]  Headline linked in red with the headline that the TSA is still groping children and I'm not gonna play the video here quite frankly.
[00:26:03.791 --> 00:26:08.172]  I've watched it two or three times It's very painful to watch if you want to go see the video.
[00:26:08.172 --> 00:26:20.054]  It's at InfoWars.com and this is the face of what America has turned into the incredibly over-the-top behavior of newborn babies
[00:26:21.394 --> 00:26:26.341]  Two-year-old boys, six-year-old girls being pulled out.
[00:26:26.341 --> 00:26:37.396]  And I witnessed this when I was in San Jose back late last year flying back from Santa Cruz where I gave a speech.
[00:26:38.408 --> 00:26:43.031]  Also went out there to be part of the History Channel's show on Bohemian Grove.
[00:26:43.031 --> 00:26:45.132]  Killed two birds with one stone.
[00:26:45.132 --> 00:26:49.775]  And I noticed that it was only women and children they were searching and putting through scanners.
[00:26:49.775 --> 00:26:53.477]  And they'd put them through scanners and then they'd grope them and
[00:26:54.861 --> 00:26:57.042]  I've noticed this when I fly other places.
[00:26:57.042 --> 00:27:09.027]  They like to target groups that won't resist, that won't talk back, and of course the low-level bureaucrats, the minimum wage goons, violating people, inducting them into slavery, they don't understand what they're doing.
[00:27:09.027 --> 00:27:10.828]  They believe it's really to stop terrorists, most of them.
[00:27:11.448 --> 00:27:13.109]  Others are perverts and control freaks.
[00:27:13.109 --> 00:27:22.116]  There's been evidence by how many TSA workers have been arrested for pedophilia, trying to rape women, going crazy, declaring themselves God and stripping down naked and running around.
[00:27:22.116 --> 00:27:28.681]  I mean, you know, I mean, they take people that couldn't keep a job at McDonald's and teach them that there's terrorists around every corner.
[00:27:28.681 --> 00:27:35.846]  And then they tell them, search all the women, search the little children, because they will submit and we're here to break their will.
[00:27:36.812 --> 00:27:44.961]  That's basically what's going on and they intend to just continue to throw this in our face till we become acclimated.
[00:27:44.961 --> 00:27:49.407]  I remember 10 years ago there was a article
[00:27:51.425 --> 00:28:16.130]  out of one of the Chicago papers, and then following it, I found the minutes of a big symposium they were having in Chicago of the RFID manufacturers of the world, the Radio Frequency Identification Devices, and at this big event, this conference, or more than a conference, it was a convention,
[00:28:17.259 --> 00:28:27.711]  At the convention, there were the minutes of the head of it, and they said, our studies show that 87% of Americans are extremely upset about RFID.
[00:28:27.711 --> 00:28:35.920]  But our studies also show that if we just force it in, and that if we do it in a unified way, they will finally break and submit to it and then accept it.
[00:28:37.356 --> 00:28:39.778]  And that's the mindset.
[00:28:39.778 --> 00:28:44.521]  And I was flying to New York to be on The View and some other TV stations a few months ago.
[00:28:44.521 --> 00:28:47.663]  They flew me up there in first class because it was on their dime.
[00:28:47.663 --> 00:28:50.045]  I demanded it.
[00:28:50.045 --> 00:28:51.666]  ABC's The View.
[00:28:51.666 --> 00:28:57.550]  And I was sitting next to a banker, a head banker of a major U.S.
[00:28:57.550 --> 00:28:58.791]  bank.
[00:28:58.791 --> 00:29:00.192]  And he figured out who I was.
[00:29:00.192 --> 00:29:03.154]  We were having a polite argument for the two and a half hour flight.
[00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:12.043]  He just looked at me and he said, Alex, people just muddle through things.
[00:29:12.043 --> 00:29:14.264]  People just put up with things.
[00:29:14.264 --> 00:29:18.067]  And that's why you're not going to have a big resistance in this country.
[00:29:18.067 --> 00:29:24.712]  So their attitude is, hey, we're going to pull your six-year-old out of line.
[00:29:24.712 --> 00:29:26.774]  We're going to sit there and stick our hands down their pants.
[00:29:26.774 --> 00:29:28.715]  We're going to grab their crotch.
[00:29:28.715 --> 00:29:30.396]  We're going to do it to your wife and we're going to do it to you.
[00:29:30.396 --> 00:29:32.538]  And we're going to put you in a radiation baker.
[00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:35.912]  Now, here's the big issue.
[00:29:35.912 --> 00:29:38.674]  If they've already gotten to this point, what comes next?
[00:29:38.674 --> 00:29:42.097]  Let me tell you what's coming next, on the other side of this quick break.
[00:29:42.097 --> 00:29:50.704]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, stay with us, got a lot of other important news coming up as well.
[00:29:50.704 --> 00:29:54.628]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.628 --> 00:29:57.310]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:07.705]  Over the last year, Alex has told you about and many of you have experienced emergencies and disasters in unprecedented numbers.
[00:30:07.705 --> 00:30:10.347]  People have had to literally run for their lives.
[00:30:10.347 --> 00:30:12.789]  Folks, this is Steve Schenck with eFoods Direct.
[00:30:12.789 --> 00:30:17.173]  I'm not here to scare you, but when disaster strikes, you won't have time to think.
[00:30:17.173 --> 00:30:18.634]  You must act automatically.
[00:30:18.874 --> 00:30:22.378]  What does a pilot do when the helicopter engine fails in flight?
[00:30:22.378 --> 00:30:25.141]  No time to think, just act automatically.
[00:30:25.141 --> 00:30:33.511]  When the alert is broadcast, the alarm sounds, or the knock comes on your door, you'll need to be ready to act without thinking of what to do or what you need.

[00:31:04.421 --> 00:31:05.683]  Tyranny is here.
[00:31:05.683 --> 00:31:09.388]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:31:09.388 --> 00:31:11.852]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:31:11.852 --> 00:31:17.280]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:24.382]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:31:24.382 --> 00:31:30.325]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:31:30.325 --> 00:31:34.006]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:31:34.546 --> 00:31:38.809]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:31:38.809 --> 00:31:44.772]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:31:44.772 --> 00:31:48.314]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:31:48.314 --> 00:31:50.295]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:31:50.295 --> 00:31:51.416]  It's here.

[00:32:51.861 --> 00:32:52.281]  Thank you.
[00:32:52.281 --> 00:32:55.344]  What we've got here is failure to communicate.
[00:32:55.344 --> 00:32:57.886]  Some men you just can't reach.
[00:33:10.683 --> 00:33:15.906]  So you get what we had here last week, which is the way he wants it.
[00:33:15.906 --> 00:33:17.107]  Well, he is.
[00:33:17.107 --> 00:33:26.132]  I don't like it any more than you do.
[00:33:26.132 --> 00:33:28.774]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:28.774 --> 00:33:30.155]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:44.259 --> 00:33:47.340]  So, our will is being broken.
[00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:48.941]  Our police are being federalized.
[00:33:48.941 --> 00:33:57.265]  The TSA is now making good on their promise to expand checkpoints on the highways, bus stations, train stations of the country.
[00:33:58.578 --> 00:34:11.991]  Public schools all over the country, not just in Chicago, are banning parents packing their children's lunches because they can't be trusted and the state is saying your children belong to us.
[00:34:11.991 --> 00:34:21.281]  The Supreme Court has ruled that prosecutors can withhold evidence knowing you're innocent and frame you and send you to even death row to be executed.
[00:34:22.816 --> 00:34:24.817]  And the list goes on and on.
[00:34:24.817 --> 00:34:33.002]  So what comes next if they're already putting you through naked body scanners and then adding the pat-downs on top of it?
[00:34:33.002 --> 00:34:36.524]  They're building an army of people that think this is normal.
[00:34:36.524 --> 00:34:39.345]  They're training the general population that it's normal.
[00:34:39.345 --> 00:34:40.226]  And what comes next?
[00:34:41.288 --> 00:34:49.074]  Well, Bill Clinton signed an executive order that I cover in my film, America Destroyed by Design, that I made in 1997.
[00:34:49.074 --> 00:34:56.840]  They put it on the books, never implemented it, to start urine, blood, or other tissue sample testing when you get a driver's license.
[00:34:56.840 --> 00:35:06.708]  Last year, we saw an article out of the Washington Post about how great it is that they're going to start HIV testing when you get your driver's license in the District of Columbia.
[00:35:08.715 --> 00:35:12.832]  They're passing through Agenda 21, even if Congress doesn't pass the law.
[00:35:13.857 --> 00:35:33.303]  The feds, with their unfunded mandates, come in and basically force the states, not just here but all over the world, with a continuity of agenda, to start international regulations on zoning of homes, on building of a new barn, on what type of crops you can grow.
[00:35:33.303 --> 00:35:41.766]  They're now saying that farmers can put off no dust when they till the soil, but then the big agribusiness, they get waivers for it.
[00:35:42.686 --> 00:35:52.535]  All over the country they're moving to make you get a license to have a garden in your own backyard in California and areas of Oklahoma.
[00:35:52.535 --> 00:35:54.777]  Classical slavery.
[00:35:54.777 --> 00:35:56.979]  You don't pack your child to lunch.
[00:35:56.979 --> 00:35:59.742]  We're allowed to frame you even if we get caught.
[00:35:59.742 --> 00:36:01.564]  We don't get in trouble.
[00:36:01.564 --> 00:36:04.927]  You've got to get a permit to have a garden.
[00:36:04.927 --> 00:36:07.609]  You can't give your neighbor milk you got from your own cow.
[00:36:08.598 --> 00:36:10.821]  This is the control grid.
[00:36:10.821 --> 00:36:14.145]  And then I have this article out today.
[00:36:15.623 --> 00:36:20.946]  From Post Media, UN document would give Mother Earth same rights as humans.
[00:36:20.946 --> 00:36:24.749]  Now, you see, cockroaches, there are more cockroaches than there are humans.
[00:36:24.749 --> 00:36:27.271]  There are more insects than there are humans.
[00:36:27.271 --> 00:36:29.372]  There are more plants than there are humans.
[00:36:29.372 --> 00:36:34.575]  And see, they don't get to vote themselves, but the UN will vote for them.
[00:36:34.575 --> 00:36:41.600]  Oh, you still get your rights, but they're trumped if the carbon dioxide coming out of a coal plant
[00:36:42.921 --> 00:36:50.619]  If we say it's toxic waste, now we're going to put a tax on it paid directly to the private banks and people like George Soros.
[00:36:50.619 --> 00:36:51.140]  Bolivia...
[00:36:53.083 --> 00:37:07.955]  Will this month table a draft of a United Nations treaty giving Mother Earth the same rights as humans, having just passed a domestic law that does the same for bugs, trees, and all other natural things in the South American country.
[00:37:07.955 --> 00:37:14.760]  But don't worry, you can pay taxes to still be able to chop down those crops and bring them to market.
[00:37:15.541 --> 00:37:16.201]  I don't know.
[00:37:36.627 --> 00:37:40.849]  But they're not stopping genetically engineered crops that change the entire biosphere.
[00:37:40.849 --> 00:37:42.089]  No, that's racing forward.
[00:37:42.089 --> 00:37:48.112]  They're not stopping chimera cross-species mammals being mixed with plants and insects.
[00:37:48.112 --> 00:37:52.353]  They're not stopping cows that produce human milk that are part human.
[00:37:52.353 --> 00:37:59.336]  They're not stopping spiders and goats that have been mixed together with spider goats to create body armor in their milk.
[00:38:00.486 --> 00:38:09.200]  They're not stopping all the superconducting super colliders engaged in very dangerous experiments that they admit could damage or even destroy the planet.
[00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:12.565]  I mean, they developed the atomic theory 111 years ago.
[00:38:12.565 --> 00:38:14.908]  What do you think they have now?
[00:38:14.908 --> 00:38:15.509]  None of this
[00:38:17.714 --> 00:38:34.620]  None of this has anything to do with protecting the planet, just like pulling a six-year-old over who's wearing a tight shirt and little pants, clearly doesn't have a bomb or drugs, and the TSA woman, for several minutes, squeezes her arms, squeezes her legs, sticks her hands between her legs, squeezes her, goes in her pants.
[00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:38.382]  You can watch the video at InfoWars.com.
[00:38:38.382 --> 00:38:44.804]  Six-year-old girl groped, then drug-tested by TSA, and then the woman says, okay, now I'm gonna lead you over here.
[00:38:44.804 --> 00:38:46.065]  It's time for the drug test.
[00:38:47.913 --> 00:39:04.546]  And you hear the little girl saying, I don't want to do this, and you hear some other children watching, who were waiting, because again, from what I've witnessed, it's mainly women and children they do this to, women and children first, into the inferno of tyranny, and you hear children saying, I don't want them to do that to my clothes, I don't, no, no.
[00:39:04.546 --> 00:39:15.715]  I mean, imagine, sometimes you'll see a little cousin or something you haven't seen in a month, and you'll run over when they're two or three and say, give me a hug, and they're shy.
[00:39:17.003 --> 00:39:38.562]  I've even with my son and two daughters they would go through brief periods generally when they were about two years old that I've been gone all day and sometimes I'd say give me a hug give me a kiss and they'd say mommy no and be shy or my parents would come over who they see every week and they would you know run and hug mommy.
[00:39:39.563 --> 00:39:43.765]  I mean, that's just how children are, even with their own parents sometimes.
[00:39:43.765 --> 00:39:54.590]  But now, in a big airport, with all these adults around, all these people looking, and lights, and big machines, and people in authoritative uniforms, with their obese potbellies hanging over.
[00:39:55.470 --> 00:40:00.978]  Taking your child and parents sometimes have said no don't do that and they'll shove the parents back and get back!
[00:40:00.978 --> 00:40:11.793]  We've got a bunch of the newscasts posted under this new video where that's happened and the child will start crying and they'll rip the shirt off or a woman they'll pull her blouse off in Amarillo.
[00:40:12.972 --> 00:40:19.217]  And she'll start crying, and then the men come over and say, man, you've got really nice breast, so she won a lawsuit.
[00:40:19.217 --> 00:40:21.679]  I mean, they just think everything is their authority.
[00:40:21.679 --> 00:40:30.886]  They think they're God, just strutting around in a government bureaucrat riot, an orgy of oppression against us.
[00:40:30.886 --> 00:40:39.613]  And they just continue it, and continue it, and continue it, and continue it against us, and they're not going to stop until we say no.
[00:40:42.028 --> 00:40:46.190]  If they get away with this, the sky is the limit.
[00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:48.652]  And they've basically already reached the sky.
[00:40:48.652 --> 00:40:53.555]  They've already gone past with social engineering what any other government's ever done.
[00:40:53.555 --> 00:40:59.218]  I talk a lot about this because it's such a big deal, but every month or so I see articles
[00:41:00.734 --> 00:41:05.195]  And it's always an unannounced school safety drill angered parents and children.
[00:41:05.195 --> 00:41:10.876]  The elementary students were taken into the parking lot and then told that terrorists who were against public schools were attacking.
[00:41:10.876 --> 00:41:20.537]  Police dressed as part of the federally funded drill in camouflage began to scream, we're going to kill you because we don't like public school students.
[00:41:20.537 --> 00:41:22.598]  Associated Press, Michigan.
[00:41:22.598 --> 00:41:23.738]  Did it all over the state.
[00:41:23.738 --> 00:41:26.338]  And then the police are on there going, now wait a minute.
[00:41:26.338 --> 00:41:29.899]  We got a federal grant and the federal grant says this is how we do it.
[00:41:31.274 --> 00:41:33.918]  What, Alabama two weeks ago?
[00:41:33.918 --> 00:41:40.106]  Unannounced drill, telling the kids they're gonna kill them, and that they were adults, i.e.
[00:41:40.106 --> 00:41:47.357]  parents, against illegal immigration.
[00:41:48.942 --> 00:41:52.223]  And so the idea is, oh, a pro-gun group attacked the school today.
[00:41:52.223 --> 00:41:55.104]  A pro-sovereignty group attacked the school today.
[00:41:55.104 --> 00:41:57.184]  A pro-homeschooling group attacked the school.
[00:41:57.184 --> 00:42:07.087]  And I've had the teachers on with their lawyers, where they come out to the portable building, men in uniforms or camo, and take them out in the woods and say, now we're going to execute you.
[00:42:07.087 --> 00:42:08.748]  And the people all have nervous breakdowns.
[00:42:08.748 --> 00:42:09.628]  The kids have nightmares.
[00:42:10.558 --> 00:42:17.879]  But most of the parents don't want to accuse the authority figures of engaging in a mass re-education camp brainwashing situation.
[00:42:17.879 --> 00:42:21.460]  So they twist it and say those dirty homeschoolers.
[00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:25.341]  We had to do it because the homeschoolers want to blow the school up.
[00:42:25.341 --> 00:42:31.702]  And sometimes they again roll in a bus or a car and they set it on fire and it blows up in front of everyone.
[00:42:31.702 --> 00:42:32.942]  This is on the news.
[00:42:32.942 --> 00:42:35.323]  They even blow a car up in front of little kids.
[00:42:36.530 --> 00:42:54.699]  In fact, when I asked you to search that yesterday, I know I keep going back to this, did you find the article where they make them... The school wanted to be more realistic, so while the masked gunman went through the school for eight hours, being played by the local police, the children were not allowed to eat lunch and had to use the bathroom in trash cans.
[00:42:54.699 --> 00:43:01.222]  And then the school principal was on the news going, we wanted this to be as realistic as possible during the true lockdown.
[00:43:01.222 --> 00:43:05.844]  We understand this can be seen as traumatic, but it's for your safety, anything for safety.
[00:43:07.130 --> 00:43:08.631]  That case was about five years ago.
[00:43:08.631 --> 00:43:11.372]  I played that newscast over and over again on air.
[00:43:11.372 --> 00:43:12.853]  Do we ever find that?
[00:43:12.853 --> 00:43:20.816]  During drill, children made to use the bathroom in buckets or trash cans?
[00:43:20.816 --> 00:43:21.856]  That was one thing we couldn't find.
[00:43:21.856 --> 00:43:24.998]  Well, we'll keep looking for that because I remember that happening.
[00:43:26.061 --> 00:43:27.643]  So, all of this is going on.
[00:43:27.643 --> 00:43:31.567]  I mean, we're in a hardcore revolution against liberty.
[00:43:31.567 --> 00:43:40.456]  There's a hardcore overturning of the existing order of personal space, liberty, innocent until proven guilty, and on top of it all,
[00:43:41.778 --> 00:43:59.050]  I read the quotes out of the Chicago Tribune yesterday where the principal and the school spokesperson for the different Chicago school districts that are doing this saying, well, the school makes better choices, the school has better food, and we're sorry, you know, parents cannot be trusted to
[00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:05.060]  Make the school lunches.
[00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:08.701]  I mean, the message is we own your children.
[00:44:08.701 --> 00:44:20.624]  And while they're in these public schools, I mean, look, if you want an example of how deceptive government is, just at the grassroots level, it's default training with the school nurse and with the assistant principal and the principal.
[00:44:20.624 --> 00:44:26.225]  And countless parents have called me and emailed me and said exactly what you said happened because I've experienced it.
[00:44:28.177 --> 00:44:32.638]  Over the years, doing research and talking to families.
[00:44:32.638 --> 00:44:34.499]  They have the waiver form.
[00:44:34.499 --> 00:44:37.520]  That's a waiver for something that isn't even a law.
[00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:40.521]  By color of law, they say, your child hadn't been vaccinated.
[00:44:40.521 --> 00:44:41.621]  We're going to kick them out of school.
[00:44:41.621 --> 00:44:45.942]  And then once we kick them out, we're going to charge them with truancy, which itself is a fraud.
[00:44:45.942 --> 00:44:47.583]  There's no law to take the vaccine.
[00:44:47.583 --> 00:44:53.605]  Then when they kick you out of school, you're not supposed to be charged with truancy because under the laws of the 50 states, they're universal.
[00:44:53.605 --> 00:44:55.625]  That's not truancy if you're kicked out.
[00:44:55.625 --> 00:44:56.266]  But they don't care.
[00:44:56.266 --> 00:44:56.846]  They've still got
[00:44:57.864 --> 00:45:01.105]  Juvenile courts that will haul you in there.
[00:45:01.105 --> 00:45:08.428]  The parents have no knowledge of the law and they will put you in juvenile hall, which will then be good criminal training for you and hopefully ruin your life.
[00:45:08.428 --> 00:45:15.870]  They love that and create more criminals by throwing your 12-year-old in with, you know, 15, 16, 17-year-olds.
[00:45:15.870 --> 00:45:17.511]  So it's this path into the prisons.
[00:45:17.511 --> 00:45:22.833]  The schools are designed to brainwash you, make you subservient, mainline a lot of people to go into prison.
[00:45:24.045 --> 00:45:26.988]  And so the parents go in and say, well, I don't have to vaccinate.
[00:45:26.988 --> 00:45:27.548]  There's no law.
[00:45:27.548 --> 00:45:31.352]  And they say, what are you talking about, Mrs. Johnson?
[00:45:31.352 --> 00:45:32.413]  Yes, it's the law.
[00:45:32.413 --> 00:45:33.354]  You're going to be suspended.
[00:45:33.354 --> 00:45:36.637]  And you say, I know you have that waiver form in that file cabinet.
[00:45:36.637 --> 00:45:38.498]  What, right there behind you?
[00:45:38.498 --> 00:45:42.162]  And they'll say, oh, you mean the waiver form?
[00:45:42.162 --> 00:45:43.843]  Yes, I forgot.
[00:45:43.843 --> 00:45:47.467]  These are hard core
[00:45:51.846 --> 00:45:57.150]  Hardcore, anti-American, brainwashed Nazi scum.
[00:45:57.150 --> 00:46:01.414]  They're lying to you and telling, that's not harsh terms for that.
[00:46:01.414 --> 00:46:17.347]  They're there lying to you, sending letters home, calling you, saying Junior is gonna be thrown out, little Betty is gonna be thrown out of school unless she takes this vaccine, unless he takes it.
[00:46:18.137 --> 00:46:25.743]  And they've got new ones they're trying to mandate every year, and the big pharma comes in and just finances the state governors, and then put it on the list of mandatory vaccines.
[00:46:25.743 --> 00:46:27.945]  That means mandatory on their recommended list.
[00:46:27.945 --> 00:46:29.966]  Then they color of law engage in fraud.
[00:46:29.966 --> 00:46:38.012]  This is a government that doesn't just put sodium fluoride in your water, knowing it gives a seven-fold increase in bone cancer for men, three-fold increase for women.
[00:46:38.012 --> 00:46:38.813]  This is a government.
[00:46:39.977 --> 00:46:48.904]  That knowingly mines phosphate with radioactive isotopes at high levels and puts it in your water to give you cancer and sterilize you.
[00:46:48.904 --> 00:46:54.128]  Just like the federal government's been caught all over the world shooting people up with live syphilis, telling them it's a vaccine program.
[00:46:55.029 --> 00:46:56.890]  They love to target children.
[00:46:56.890 --> 00:46:58.551]  They love to murder children.
[00:46:58.551 --> 00:47:00.732]  They want to murder you and your family.
[00:47:00.732 --> 00:47:13.739]  Now, the mindless nurse or the mindless principal is just a bootlicking follower that does whatever they're told, and the teacher that doesn't do whatever they're told, they never become any type of administrator.
[00:47:14.724 --> 00:47:28.694]  The teacher that wants to teach and is a good, smart person, they stay low-level and are basically harassed by the throng of communistic, brainwashed compliers.
[00:47:28.694 --> 00:47:30.916]  Why do you think the principals are getting paid $200,000, $300,000 a year?
[00:47:34.804 --> 00:47:35.204]  We're good to go.
[00:48:06.884 --> 00:48:10.225]  In 2009, we first started getting reports from listeners.
[00:48:10.225 --> 00:48:17.467]  It's like we got reports eight, nine months ago, they were sticking their hands down people's pants and people couldn't believe it until it happened to one of my employees.
[00:48:17.467 --> 00:48:22.268]  Then reporters started coming out from TV, radio, print saying it happened to me.
[00:48:22.268 --> 00:48:24.349]  Then TSA admitted they were doing it.
[00:48:24.349 --> 00:48:27.109]  First, they just lied and said they weren't, even though it was the policy.
[00:48:27.109 --> 00:48:30.770]  Again, a policy of deception.
[00:48:30.770 --> 00:48:32.631]  I just digressed off into TSA.
[00:48:32.631 --> 00:48:34.191]  What was the point I was talking about right before that?
[00:48:39.380 --> 00:48:52.446]  Yeah, well, I mean, I was giving one example how there's universal lying and then I went back into TSA and I was gonna go back and show the culture of lying in another area.
[00:48:52.446 --> 00:48:55.848]  Oh, the swine flu.
[00:48:55.848 --> 00:49:03.872]  So just like we got reports months and months before it was confirmed from listeners that they were sticking hands down pants universally,
[00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:09.903]  For those pulled aside for the expanded pat-downs that TSA admits is going to go to everyone soon.
[00:49:09.903 --> 00:49:16.407]  It's like, quote, everyone will be body scanned as they told the Chicago Tribune again last year.
[00:49:16.407 --> 00:49:18.669]  It's a training process.
[00:49:18.669 --> 00:49:19.389]  It was the same thing.
[00:49:19.389 --> 00:49:25.594]  We got all these calls saying, listen, they shot my six-year-old up with a swine flu and didn't even tell me.
[00:49:25.594 --> 00:49:30.217]  And then it showed up in Houston, and then it showed up in Georgia, and then it showed up in California.
[00:49:30.217 --> 00:49:31.358]  Unified fraud.
[00:49:32.688 --> 00:49:47.482]  Where they would take your child in, even if you'd given them letters and orders not to vaccinate them, and they would shoot your child up with the dangerous H1N1 that increased Guillain-Barré, all sorts of neurological disorders, all sorts of problems on record.
[00:49:47.482 --> 00:49:54.990]  And every time they got caught, they said, gee, we're real sorry, we didn't look at the paperwork correctly.
[00:49:57.076 --> 00:49:59.717]  We didn't look at the paperwork correctly.
[00:49:59.717 --> 00:50:04.599]  We are so sorry that this happened.
[00:50:04.599 --> 00:50:08.681]  We just have to sit here and just shake our heads.
[00:50:08.681 --> 00:50:14.503]  We are so upset that we accidentally vaccinated your child.
[00:50:14.503 --> 00:50:17.064]  It was all a big accident.
[00:50:21.274 --> 00:50:30.436]  This is a government that has gone through the 310 million population and given people petty jobs in the system.
[00:50:30.436 --> 00:50:37.898]  And if they follow orders, and if they're stupid, and if they'll lie, and if they'll follow whatever they're told, they move up.
[00:50:37.898 --> 00:50:39.139]  Why, they could move up to U.S.
[00:50:39.139 --> 00:50:39.599]  Senator.
[00:50:39.599 --> 00:50:40.959]  They could move up to President.
[00:50:40.959 --> 00:50:43.080]  They could move up to CEO.
[00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:44.100]  If you'll play ball.
[00:50:45.595 --> 00:50:48.817]  And that's why the elite themselves are so delusional about things.
[00:50:48.817 --> 00:50:50.097]  Oh, we got rising radiation?
[00:50:50.097 --> 00:50:52.259]  Just raise the safe level.
[00:50:52.259 --> 00:50:57.361]  Oh, just tell parents they can't pack their kids' lunches anymore because we don't trust them.
[00:50:57.361 --> 00:50:59.042]  Oh, a warrantless checkpoints in Fourth Amendment?
[00:50:59.042 --> 00:51:00.223]  We don't need any stinking Fourth Amendment.
[00:51:00.871 --> 00:51:05.532]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:52:00.333 --> 00:52:02.154]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:52:02.154 --> 00:52:17.706]  The earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear disaster that killed thousands of Japanese citizens is nothing compared to the devastation that could be caused by hyperinflation that will soon hit the United States and could lead to millions of Americans becoming homeless, all caused by the devalued U.S.
[00:52:17.706 --> 00:52:18.046]  dollar.
[00:52:18.046 --> 00:52:26.573]  While the mainstream media continues to ignore inflation, our friends at the National Inflation Association provide a free weekly newsletter that educates Americans of the facts
[00:52:26.673 --> 00:52:26.873]  We're good.
[00:52:45.424 --> 00:52:54.913]  The NIA's team of expert economists are happy to answer any economic questions you have about inflation, debt, currencies, real estate, precious metals, and commodities.
[00:52:54.913 --> 00:53:00.237]  Visit inflation.us to learn the economic truth that the mainstream media ignores.
[00:53:00.237 --> 00:53:01.538]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:53:01.538 --> 00:53:07.123]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:53:07.123 --> 00:53:08.725]  Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[00:53:08.945 --> 00:53:12.128]  Non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold.
[00:53:12.128 --> 00:53:17.713]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:53:17.713 --> 00:53:22.937]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:53:22.937 --> 00:53:30.063]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:53:30.063 --> 00:53:30.904]  And here's the best part.
[00:53:31.164 --> 00:53:34.205]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:53:34.205 --> 00:53:37.847]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:53:37.847 --> 00:53:41.029]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:53:41.029 --> 00:53:43.250]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:53:43.250 --> 00:53:44.210]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:53:44.210 --> 00:53:44.450]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:53:44.450 --> 00:53:47.832]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:53:47.832 --> 00:53:49.592]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:54:12.831 --> 00:54:20.923]  Cyrus Jones from 1810 to 1913 made his great-grandchildren believe you could live to 103.
[00:54:20.923 --> 00:54:23.707]  103 is forever when you're just a little kid.
[00:54:28.564 --> 00:54:30.085]  The government is too big.
[00:54:30.085 --> 00:54:31.226]  It's out of control.
[00:54:31.226 --> 00:54:47.318]  It's controlled by corrupt offshore corporations and banks who have openly stated they not only want to turn us into domesticated, dumbed-down slaves, that's only a means to an end to forcibly reduce world population.
[00:54:47.318 --> 00:54:50.661]  Japan only has 1.2 children for every two adults.
[00:54:50.661 --> 00:54:52.062]  They're dying.
[00:54:52.062 --> 00:54:52.763]  Italy has 1.2 children.
[00:54:52.763 --> 00:54:53.043]  England, 1.4.
[00:54:53.043 --> 00:54:53.803]  The United States is dying.
[00:54:57.563 --> 00:55:00.285]  Except for the giant immigrant population coming in.
[00:55:00.285 --> 00:55:04.567]  The globalists are carrying out their program.
[00:55:04.567 --> 00:55:08.250]  And they are now moving against the third world as well.
[00:55:08.250 --> 00:55:12.873]  And people better wake up and realize this is not my opinion.
[00:55:12.873 --> 00:55:21.158]  And I want to tell the cops and the bureaucrats and the people out there, the corporate minions, the people that make up this power structure.
[00:55:21.158 --> 00:55:22.378]  You have been actuaried.
[00:55:22.378 --> 00:55:23.259]  You have been assessed.
[00:55:23.259 --> 00:55:24.560]  You've been compartmentalized.
[00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:25.941]  You've been psychologically typed.
[00:55:26.860 --> 00:55:31.965]  You are being basically maneuvered and put in by the engineers where they want you.
[00:55:31.965 --> 00:55:33.267]  You are under attack.
[00:55:33.267 --> 00:55:34.148]  You got that, cop?
[00:55:35.529 --> 00:55:40.272]  I mean, most cops, if you smart-mouth them in any way, you're lucky if you don't go to the hospital.
[00:55:40.272 --> 00:55:45.596]  But then the government can put poison in you and your children's water, and you love it.
[00:55:45.596 --> 00:55:48.698]  Because you're trained to accept the big bosses hurting you.
[00:55:48.698 --> 00:55:50.479]  You're trained to feel powerless.
[00:55:50.479 --> 00:55:54.642]  You are on the same side as the American people, whether you know it or not.
[00:55:54.642 --> 00:56:01.247]  To these TSA workers, well, we know most TSA workers only work there for about a year.
[00:56:02.349 --> 00:56:05.090]  They call them in, they say, do you have a problem with the radiation machines?
[00:56:05.090 --> 00:56:07.011]  Do you have a problem sticking your hands down people's pants?
[00:56:07.011 --> 00:56:10.673]  If you say yes, they pink slip you next pay period.
[00:56:10.673 --> 00:56:15.915]  And so they're creating a group of TSA people that will do anything.
[00:56:17.287 --> 00:56:21.428]  And when the TSA people try to say, no, we don't want to do this, they're fired.
[00:56:21.428 --> 00:56:41.674]  And so they end up only with either total idiots who don't understand what they're doing or very sadistic control freaks who like a job grabbing Jesse Ventura's genitals, grabbing Ron Paul's crotch, sticking their hands down people's pants, doing this to little children.
[00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:48.803]  I mean, this is incredible.
[00:56:48.803 --> 00:56:51.486]  And it's about getting rid of our modesty, getting rid of our humanity.
[00:56:51.486 --> 00:56:58.895]  Well, I think the military all over the world, not just here, is trying for the last few decades to make men and women bunk together.
[00:56:58.895 --> 00:57:01.278]  Men and women use the same bathrooms.
[00:57:01.278 --> 00:57:05.082]  So you're in there in the head, sitting on the toilet right next to a woman.
[00:57:05.082 --> 00:57:06.244]  You're in the shower with women.
[00:57:07.571 --> 00:57:10.253]  They're trying to get rid of our basic humanity.
[00:57:10.253 --> 00:57:16.477]  They're trying to totally re-engineer us and break down the natural order so that we can be socially engineered.
[00:57:16.477 --> 00:57:26.104]  And they write countless textbooks and white papers for more than 150 years out of England about this social engineering to end the family as we know it.
[00:57:26.104 --> 00:57:29.046]  And now, all over the country, they're saying, we're not gonna allow homeschooling.
[00:57:29.046 --> 00:57:30.206]  We say so.
[00:57:30.206 --> 00:57:31.407]  Your child belongs to us.
[00:57:31.407 --> 00:57:33.989]  We're not gonna allow you to pack your child a lunch, period.
[00:57:35.145 --> 00:57:45.088]  We're gonna train your child to report on you in English class on federally funded computers that are being downloaded about what goes on in your home life.
[00:57:45.088 --> 00:58:00.593]  I was sent, 13 years ago, and it's in my film, Police State to the Takeover, the internal documents out of major cities around the country, Kentucky and others, where the ATF, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives,
[00:58:02.039 --> 00:58:02.259]  I don't
[00:58:20.695 --> 00:58:26.700]  In there and it says the officer will have access to the children during recess time and lunch.
[00:58:26.700 --> 00:58:29.843]  And they're in there taking your kids away from you.
[00:58:29.843 --> 00:58:35.608]  Look at Explorer Scouts, New York Times, trained to take on disgruntled veterans.
[00:58:35.608 --> 00:58:39.551]  Those 14 year olds, that was four years ago, they're now 18, they're ready to kill.
[00:58:39.551 --> 00:58:48.139]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:50.404 --> 00:58:54.967]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:58:54.967 --> 00:58:55.867]  Number 1.
[00:58:55.867 --> 00:58:59.290]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:58:59.290 --> 00:59:00.150]  Number 2.
[00:59:00.150 --> 00:59:05.053]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:59:05.053 --> 00:59:05.794]  It's true.
[00:59:05.794 --> 00:59:10.657]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:59:10.657 --> 00:59:11.497]  Number 3.
[00:59:11.497 --> 00:59:15.080]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:59:15.080 --> 00:59:18.762]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:59:18.982 --> 00:59:19.782]  Number 4.
[00:59:19.782 --> 00:59:22.543]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:59:22.543 --> 00:59:26.225]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:59:26.225 --> 00:59:27.005]  Number 5.
[00:59:27.005 --> 00:59:31.147]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:59:31.147 --> 00:59:36.209]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:59:55.859 --> 00:59:58.621]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.236 --> 01:00:10.057]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.057 --> 01:00:11.638]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.638 --> 01:00:13.178]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.178 --> 01:00:17.379]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.379 --> 01:00:21.440]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:26.528 --> 01:00:37.035]  Hour number two, Dr. Bob Bowman, three degrees in nuclear physics, will be joining us to cover the incredible developments of the admission that now the Fukushima disaster is as bad as Chernobyl.
[01:00:37.035 --> 01:00:40.137]  He had expert guest on three weeks ago, breaking that down like Dr. Busby.
[01:00:40.137 --> 01:00:42.339]  He'll be joining us for 30 minutes of the next hour.
[01:00:42.339 --> 01:00:45.881]  I'm gonna open the phones up for the next 20 minutes, but humor me.
[01:00:45.881 --> 01:00:48.703]  We don't normally screen calls, but you have to self-screen yourself.
[01:00:48.703 --> 01:00:56.068]  I only want to get your take on Chicago school districts and other school districts saying no sack lunches allowed.
[01:00:57.748 --> 01:00:59.709]  No sack lunches allowed.
[01:00:59.709 --> 01:01:01.789]  Your parents cannot be trusted to pack your lunches.
[01:01:01.789 --> 01:01:03.949]  They actually say that in the newspaper.
[01:01:03.949 --> 01:01:07.870]  They actually say the school basically owns your children.
[01:01:07.870 --> 01:01:16.372]  And on top of that, this new TSA video of a six-year-old and other scared children saying, Mommy, I don't want them to touch me.
[01:01:16.372 --> 01:01:19.492]  You can hear that in the background with other kids getting real scared.
[01:01:19.492 --> 01:01:21.613]  It's so painful to watch.
[01:01:21.613 --> 01:01:23.573]  And they're just shutting down our transportation.
[01:01:24.798 --> 01:01:26.462]  I want to get your view on this new video.
[01:01:26.462 --> 01:01:30.250]  Then they say, now little girl, I'm going to lead you away for the drug test.
[01:01:30.250 --> 01:01:34.199]  And again, the TSA are experimental brainwashing centers.
[01:01:34.199 --> 01:01:35.361]  Now rolling out on the streets.
[01:01:36.684 --> 01:01:39.345]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:01:39.345 --> 01:01:40.585]  800-259-9231.
[01:01:40.585 --> 01:01:54.630]  Then we're gonna have open phones, specifically on the radiation in the U.S., the radiation from Fukushima, the ongoing cover-up that they're now having to admit they were involved in a cover-up.
[01:01:54.630 --> 01:01:58.251]  That's coming up with Dr. Bob Bowman, and then, of course, Dr. Christopher Busby.
[01:01:58.251 --> 01:01:59.611]  The toll-free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[01:01:59.611 --> 01:02:00.731]  But I specifically want your take
[01:02:06.113 --> 01:02:06.573]  I don't
[01:02:27.478 --> 01:02:28.299]  We're good to go.
[01:02:49.035 --> 01:02:52.200]  Uh, when they bankrupt the system, they want us to be servile.
[01:02:52.200 --> 01:03:00.211]  Uh, when the cancer rates go up, and the fertility level drops, that's why they put the radioactive isotopes in the drinking water.
[01:03:00.211 --> 01:03:03.676]  And you're so brain damaged, and I'm so brain damaged, we can't even get upset about it now.
[01:03:04.639 --> 01:03:07.461]  Cops listening right now are like, well, at least I got a uniform and I'm on a power trip.
[01:03:07.461 --> 01:03:08.762]  I don't care if they're killing me.
[01:03:08.762 --> 01:03:10.103]  You know, this Alex Jones is a kook.
[01:03:10.103 --> 01:03:12.665]  Man, you won't even look up the fact that I lay out all the documents.
[01:03:12.665 --> 01:03:15.267]  You're on a power trip, just like some low-level bureaucrat.
[01:03:15.267 --> 01:03:18.349]  You ever seen a McDonald's manager or somebody on a power trip with their employees?
[01:03:18.349 --> 01:03:20.050]  It's the same thing.
[01:03:20.050 --> 01:03:22.612]  The system can find mindless control freaks.
[01:03:22.612 --> 01:03:26.134]  And if you're a good cop or a good teacher, well, you just don't get advanced.
[01:03:26.134 --> 01:03:28.536]  This is a very dangerous system.
[01:03:28.536 --> 01:03:33.180]  So when we come back, I'm going to take calls on the situation with the schools.
[01:03:34.950 --> 01:03:37.204]  And the grump downs that are going on.
[01:03:39.269 --> 01:03:39.849]  at the airport.
[01:04:09.949 --> 01:04:15.371]  Then you can give the books to people, you can make copies of my films, air them on AXS TV, I want you to.
[01:04:15.371 --> 01:04:26.874]  It's having a huge effect, but remember that our success is governed by you spreading the word about the broadcast, by you getting the books, the videos, the t-shirts, because that financially supports us and what we're doing.
[01:04:26.874 --> 01:04:33.396]  And we have a special, when you get Big Brother, The Orwellian Nightmare Come True, with Jesse Ventura, 63 documents the government doesn't want you to read.
[01:04:34.036 --> 01:04:40.543]  You can get one of my films, A 1995 Value, absolutely free when you get the two books together, and they're both discounted as well.
[01:04:40.543 --> 01:04:42.365]  So, InfoWars.com.

[01:04:56.039 --> 01:04:56.480]  Stay with us.
[01:05:00.896 --> 01:05:07.841]  Over the last year, Alex has told you about and many of you have experienced emergencies and disasters in unprecedented numbers.
[01:05:07.841 --> 01:05:10.482]  People have had to literally run for their lives.
[01:05:10.482 --> 01:05:12.924]  Folks, this is Steve Schenck with eFoods Direct.
[01:05:12.924 --> 01:05:17.307]  I'm not here to scare you, but when disaster strikes, you won't have time to think.
[01:05:17.307 --> 01:05:18.788]  You must act automatically.
[01:05:19.008 --> 01:05:22.530]  What does a pilot do when the helicopter engine fails in flight?
[01:05:22.530 --> 01:05:25.292]  No time to think, just act automatically.
[01:05:25.292 --> 01:05:33.656]  When the alert is broadcast, the alarm sounds, or the knock comes on your door, you'll need to be ready to act without thinking of what to do or what you need.
[01:05:33.656 --> 01:05:36.438]  You need a 5-Day Extreme Emergency Kit.
[01:05:36.678 --> 01:05:46.361]  With serious supplies and real food to secure two adults for five days, this powerful $300 Extreme Emergency Kit is free with an order of at least $995 from eFoodsDirect.

[01:06:00.425 --> 01:06:08.529]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:06:08.529 --> 01:06:11.070]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:06:11.070 --> 01:06:16.453]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:06:16.453 --> 01:06:19.494]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:06:19.494 --> 01:06:21.555]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:06:21.815 --> 01:06:28.058]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:06:28.058 --> 01:06:31.439]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:06:31.439 --> 01:06:37.222]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:06:37.222 --> 01:06:38.863]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:06:38.863 --> 01:06:40.163]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:06:40.163 --> 01:06:42.824]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:06:42.824 --> 01:06:44.245]  He explains everything you need to know.
[01:06:44.525 --> 01:06:47.047]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:06:47.047 --> 01:06:51.671]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:06:51.671 --> 01:06:54.273]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[01:07:01.974 --> 01:07:05.935]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:07:05.935 --> 01:07:14.796]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:07:14.796 --> 01:07:19.437]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:07:19.437 --> 01:07:30.239]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:07:30.879 --> 01:07:40.382]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:07:40.382 --> 01:07:45.824]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:07:45.824 --> 01:07:53.307]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.

[01:08:00.802 --> 01:08:06.087]  Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:06.087 --> 01:08:08.369]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:13.055 --> 01:08:18.878]  Okay, Dr. Bob Bowman, nuclear physicist, former head of the Star Wars program, is going to join us to cover the incredible developments.
[01:08:18.878 --> 01:08:21.059]  They're now admitting what we told you three weeks ago.
[01:08:21.059 --> 01:08:23.600]  Fukushima, as bad as Chernobyl.
[01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:25.401]  Dr. Busby is going to be joining us.
[01:08:25.401 --> 01:08:28.103]  He said three weeks ago it was worse than Chernobyl.
[01:08:28.103 --> 01:08:31.844]  Then, the ongoing cover-up and increased radiation levels here in the U.S.
[01:08:31.844 --> 01:08:40.129]  with the feds raising the safe level of radiation in a statistical, clear manipulation part of this culture of lies.
[01:08:40.129 --> 01:08:42.190]  But I want to take a round of calls right now.
[01:08:43.427 --> 01:08:52.244]  I want to get to everybody, so let's be quick because I want to hear from everyone about the fact that once we learned this was happening in Chicago, we did some searches and found out in other parts of the country.
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:58.503]  They send letters home with the parents saying what you're allowed to put in their lunch.
[01:08:58.503 --> 01:09:02.565]  You know, you will put a fruit, you will put a vegetable, you will put this type of sandwich in.
[01:09:02.565 --> 01:09:06.287]  And now other school districts are just saying, no lunches allowed, period.
[01:09:06.287 --> 01:09:09.188]  You must buy it from the company store, from the government.
[01:09:09.188 --> 01:09:11.650]  Many schools, you got to thumbprint biometrically.
[01:09:11.650 --> 01:09:13.331]  I mean, just total control.
[01:09:14.411 --> 01:09:28.301]  We now also have a new TSA video of a six-year-old girl and other children begging to not be searched in the background saying I'm scared I don't want to be searched and then they say come with me little girl after sticking their hand down her pants and groping her all over between her legs.
[01:09:28.301 --> 01:09:30.582]  They lead her over for a quote drug test.
[01:09:30.582 --> 01:09:36.946]  She's wearing a little tight shirt and little pants six-year-old clearly nothing hidden guilty until proven innocent being trained how to be a slave.
[01:09:36.946 --> 01:09:38.828]  We're taking calls on this incredible
[01:09:39.568 --> 01:09:40.308]  Hey, how you doing?
[01:09:40.308 --> 01:09:43.870]  I just wanted to point out that you guys have mentioned this before, but the inevitability of gradualism.
[01:10:06.153 --> 01:10:07.855]  They just pick away and pick away.
[01:10:07.855 --> 01:10:15.501]  I mean, I noticed last year I went to a Christmas function at my son's school here in Missouri, and they wouldn't mention the word Christmas.
[01:10:15.501 --> 01:10:18.283]  It was a holiday festive event.
[01:10:18.283 --> 01:10:21.226]  No, they're taking our words away.
[01:10:21.226 --> 01:10:23.708]  They're telling people they can get in trouble for what they say.
[01:10:23.708 --> 01:10:28.412]  They're totally rewriting our culture.
[01:10:28.412 --> 01:10:31.835]  And to me, it's just another illustration of how asleep Americans still are.
[01:10:32.901 --> 01:10:38.062]  You know, they're coming right into your home, right into your family now, and I just don't know what it's going to be.
[01:10:38.062 --> 01:10:47.344]  The Houston Police Chief has proposed again cameras in citizens' homes in England with 24,000, or 22,000 families.
[01:10:47.344 --> 01:10:53.785]  When a new baby's born, they put cameras in the house preemptively and then take them away if you do anything wrong.
[01:10:53.785 --> 01:10:58.506]  I know I hear a lot of people, when you talk about this, you just brought this to my mind about the camera thing.
[01:10:58.506 --> 01:11:02.707]  It's a little off-subject, but I happen to work for a repossession company.
[01:11:03.331 --> 01:11:08.375]  And I drive a car around that has digital recognition software and cameras on it.
[01:11:08.375 --> 01:11:11.917]  And so people laugh all the time when you talk about that, but, but it does exist.
[01:11:11.917 --> 01:11:12.197]  Yeah.
[01:11:12.197 --> 01:11:15.920]  So, so, so you have the software package that's been out for about 15 years.
[01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:21.084]  That's hooked into most of the highway cameras, but the slaves aren't told that picks up license plates.
[01:11:21.084 --> 01:11:25.487]  That way you can go around looking for cars that are on the list.
[01:11:25.487 --> 01:11:26.307]  Five 30 miles an hour.
[01:11:26.307 --> 01:11:26.728]  That's right.
[01:11:26.728 --> 01:11:27.368]  It'll pick them up.
[01:11:27.368 --> 01:11:28.889]  Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.
[01:11:28.889 --> 01:11:30.090]  And it's just, you know,
[01:11:30.669 --> 01:11:33.570]  But people just don't need to believe that this is only for that.
[01:11:33.570 --> 01:11:35.230]  I mean, they have it for facial recognition.
[01:11:35.230 --> 01:11:37.991]  They have it for everything you can think of.
[01:11:37.991 --> 01:11:46.193]  They now have an iPhone app that you can just walk around on the street videoing people and it'll pop up their names and who they are.
[01:11:46.193 --> 01:11:46.634]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:11:46.634 --> 01:11:48.794]  You were talking about that with the tattoo guy.
[01:11:48.794 --> 01:11:50.035]  I think it was last week.
[01:11:50.035 --> 01:11:51.175]  Yeah, that's just a tattoo.
[01:11:51.175 --> 01:11:53.616]  Now they have apps that actually scan faces.
[01:11:53.616 --> 01:11:55.756]  But the question is where'd they get the database?
[01:11:55.756 --> 01:11:57.537]  The database is from the DMV.
[01:11:57.537 --> 01:11:58.497]  It's self-federalized.
[01:11:59.070 --> 01:12:00.891]  Oh yeah, and that's another thing.
[01:12:00.891 --> 01:12:08.193]  Even if you're not up for repossession, six months from now you are, well I've already got hits on where you are.
[01:12:08.193 --> 01:12:11.195]  You know, from my historical hits.
[01:12:11.195 --> 01:12:12.295]  And it builds a database.
[01:12:12.295 --> 01:12:17.337]  Tell folks, how much did that software camera package cost?
[01:12:17.337 --> 01:12:22.119]  It's around $14,500 in total with the server and the cameras.
[01:12:22.967 --> 01:12:23.848]  Yeah, that's what I saw.
[01:12:23.848 --> 01:12:25.630]  About 10 years ago, it was over $100,000.
[01:12:25.630 --> 01:12:27.311]  Then it was $20,000.
[01:12:27.311 --> 01:12:30.154]  Last number I saw was about $15,000 for the package.
[01:12:30.154 --> 01:12:32.196]  I can buy the package!
[01:12:32.196 --> 01:12:34.379]  Yeah, anybody can.
[01:12:34.379 --> 01:12:35.420]  Anybody can.
[01:12:35.420 --> 01:12:41.366]  And, you know, but like I said, that's not really... What I do with it isn't really, you know...
[01:12:42.611 --> 01:12:43.171]  We're good to go.
[01:12:59.404 --> 01:13:04.206]  And he got sick of the fact that the illegal aliens, the APD, have these cars.
[01:13:04.206 --> 01:13:07.047]  They don't really tell the slaves that, but a lot of their cars have it now.
[01:13:07.047 --> 01:13:08.548]  He just slapped Mexican plates on it.
[01:13:08.548 --> 01:13:09.809]  He's like God now.
[01:13:09.809 --> 01:13:11.109]  Doesn't get pulled over.
[01:13:11.109 --> 01:13:12.650]  Gets totally left alone.
[01:13:12.650 --> 01:13:15.891]  And they literally just fall down and worship him because he's got Mexican plates.
[01:13:15.891 --> 01:13:18.352]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:13:18.352 --> 01:13:21.014]  I mean, that's because you can't buck the system.
[01:13:21.014 --> 01:13:23.095]  And that's not what they want it used for.
[01:13:23.095 --> 01:13:23.895]  They want it used for us.
[01:13:25.663 --> 01:13:26.624]  Well, exactly.
[01:13:26.624 --> 01:13:29.146]  I mean, you get your car stolen, the cops won't even come out.
[01:13:29.146 --> 01:13:31.707]  And I've seen these cop shows where they're driving around with it.
[01:13:31.707 --> 01:13:32.648]  Oh, that's a stolen car.
[01:13:32.648 --> 01:13:34.109]  That's a stolen car.
[01:13:34.109 --> 01:13:37.392]  And they let the violent offenders go, but then keep the nonviolent.
[01:13:37.392 --> 01:13:38.753]  Justin, great point.
[01:13:38.753 --> 01:13:39.713]  Anything else you want to add?
[01:13:39.713 --> 01:13:41.635]  No, that's it.
[01:13:41.635 --> 01:13:42.155]  Thanks.
[01:13:42.155 --> 01:13:44.217]  Thank you, sir.
[01:13:44.217 --> 01:13:45.818]  It's just beyond insane.
[01:13:48.271 --> 01:14:05.941]  They're paying thousands of Austinites to have a satellite tracker box in their car, the Feds are, just where I live, it's all over the country, and they get an insurance discount and the Feds pay them, I think it's $600 a year, last time I saw the numbers, to put the satellite tracker in, and the Department of Transportation admits that they plan to have this in all cars soon.
[01:14:05.941 --> 01:14:08.242]  And you tell a yuppie this and they just laugh at you.
[01:14:08.242 --> 01:14:11.484]  Hey, there's uranium in your tap water, they add it, ha ha ha ha!
[01:14:11.484 --> 01:14:14.086]  Hey, those cameras are face scanning you, ha ha ha ha!
[01:14:14.086 --> 01:14:16.507]  Hey, they put steroids in vaccines, ha ha ha ha!
[01:14:18.237 --> 01:14:24.120]  Hey Alex, what's going on?
[01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:28.162]  It's good to talk to you finally.
[01:14:28.162 --> 01:14:32.544]  I was going to say you brought up the whole homeschooling thing and of course it just hit me.
[01:14:32.544 --> 01:14:35.886]  I was homeschooled and I went to public school up to about 6th grade.
[01:14:36.570 --> 01:14:49.321]  You know, I'm not too ashamed to admit that I didn't graduate high school, but none of my friends that did graduate high school, and some of which are in the military, know nothing about Hitler, concentration camps, Constitution, JFK, none of it.
[01:14:49.321 --> 01:14:53.064]  And there are like 20, 21, 23, none of them.
[01:14:53.064 --> 01:14:58.949]  And of course, I'm, you know, last grade I was in was I'm, you know, about 6th or 7th, and yet I know plenty of about it.
[01:14:58.949 --> 01:15:02.792]  So it just shows you where our country's going when our military doesn't even teach
[01:15:06.117 --> 01:15:10.538]  Well, anyone that puts their child in public school needs to have their head examined.
[01:15:10.538 --> 01:15:14.039]  And I understand the way the economy is, and they already take your property tax to pay for it.
[01:15:14.039 --> 01:15:17.541]  A lot of people don't have the money to put them in private school or homeschool them.
[01:15:17.541 --> 01:15:21.042]  But, I mean, I can't believe that I was in public school.
[01:15:21.042 --> 01:15:26.063]  I mean, it was fighting, sex, total peer pressure.
[01:15:26.063 --> 01:15:27.064]  It was hellish.
[01:15:27.064 --> 01:15:30.345]  I mean, I was having a good time, but in hindsight, I mean,
[01:15:31.725 --> 01:15:36.749]  All that TV culture, all that corruption, it is just there in those schools.
[01:15:36.749 --> 01:15:44.594]  And you learn how to love Nike tennis shoes, and how to try to dress cool, and everybody's trying to compete with each other to be more adult.
[01:15:44.594 --> 01:15:49.117]  And you don't get your parents' values, you get the system's values, and look at America falling apart.
[01:15:50.162 --> 01:15:51.083]  Well, that's all they care about.
[01:15:51.083 --> 01:15:55.145]  They care about what you look like, if you've got tattoos, or what color your hair is.
[01:15:55.145 --> 01:15:59.387]  They care more about that than what you're learning, and they don't teach you anything anyway.
[01:15:59.387 --> 01:16:07.792]  My friends don't know anything, and yet, of course, like I said, nothing about the Constitution, nothing about history, and it really just upsets me and frankly just pisses me off.
[01:16:07.792 --> 01:16:16.677]  Well, Jordan, I appreciate your call, but you know, statistically, almost every international spelling bee champion, geography bee champion, they're always homeschoolers.
[01:16:16.677 --> 01:16:18.017]  And Big Fortune 100 headhunt
[01:16:20.711 --> 01:16:23.393]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[01:16:23.393 --> 01:16:26.295]  Can you hear me?
[01:16:26.295 --> 01:16:28.816]  Yes, sir.
[01:16:28.816 --> 01:16:39.144]  Yeah, Alex, you know, you were talking about the police state and being guilty until proven innocent.
[01:16:39.144 --> 01:16:49.251]  I'm out here in Suffolk County in New York, and we've seen a record number of parents committing suicide, murder-suicides, and it's based upon
[01:16:50.063 --> 01:16:52.491]  They're losing their children left and right.
[01:16:52.491 --> 01:16:55.299]  CPS, ACS, Family Court.
[01:16:55.299 --> 01:16:57.205]  They're more or less just taking their children.
[01:16:57.998 --> 01:17:01.160]  And making them fight and try to gain it later on.
[01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:05.243]  Well, you know, nine times out of ten, I'll hear an alert on the radio locally.
[01:17:05.243 --> 01:17:06.665]  A child was kidnapped today.
[01:17:06.665 --> 01:17:08.026]  A child was kidnapped today.
[01:17:08.026 --> 01:17:09.246]  And then I'll go look up the news.
[01:17:09.246 --> 01:17:12.509]  They won't even tell you until the next day that it was the father and the mother.
[01:17:12.509 --> 01:17:16.392]  And that CPS says that they might be abusing him.
[01:17:16.392 --> 01:17:17.373]  And these aren't real courts.
[01:17:17.373 --> 01:17:18.313]  There's not due process.
[01:17:18.313 --> 01:17:19.294]  And the parents run.
[01:17:19.294 --> 01:17:21.576]  And they put it on the news there's been a kidnapping.
[01:17:22.136 --> 01:17:28.982]  And then meanwhile, you're five times more likely, the Department of Justice even admits, to be abused in government hands than any other place.
[01:17:28.982 --> 01:17:32.986]  The government is the greater of any evil.
[01:17:32.986 --> 01:17:35.008]  And they've set it up where they have no liability.
[01:17:35.008 --> 01:17:42.014]  Remember a few years ago, I played that news clip out of Arkansas, where in one week, two kids in one town died in foster care?
[01:17:42.014 --> 01:17:46.839]  And the head of the CPS went on the air and said, children will die.
[01:17:47.259 --> 01:17:48.260]  That's just the way it is.
[01:17:48.260 --> 01:17:49.361]  Children will die.
[01:17:49.361 --> 01:17:51.502]  In fact, I searched the video on YouTube.
[01:17:51.502 --> 01:17:54.144]  CPS head says, children will die.
[01:17:54.144 --> 01:17:56.286]  And he's like, children will die.
[01:17:56.286 --> 01:18:05.032]  But yes, I see these reports of the suicides increasing, society falling apart, as they turn the resources off, as it's impossible for people to make it.
[01:18:05.032 --> 01:18:06.653]  And the system just loves it.
[01:18:06.653 --> 01:18:07.854]  They just, it's working well.
[01:18:09.879 --> 01:18:11.900]  I definitely appreciate you taking the time to hear it.
[01:18:11.900 --> 01:18:19.444]  You know, the one thing that people don't realize is that all of these officials and people doing this, they all have judicial immunity.
[01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:21.421]  And there's no accountability.
[01:18:21.421 --> 01:18:23.582]  So basically, you're on your own.
[01:18:23.582 --> 01:18:29.406]  And if you try to go get help, senators, congressmen, nobody really cares.
[01:18:29.406 --> 01:18:36.932]  The Supreme Court just ruled that prosecutors are allowed to frame you, know you're innocent, and lie to put you in prison.
[01:18:36.932 --> 01:18:39.894]  They are openly saying, we are pure evil.
[01:18:39.894 --> 01:18:41.555]  We are pure evil.
[01:18:41.555 --> 01:18:44.257]  And now, you can't make your child a lunch.
[01:18:44.257 --> 01:18:45.818]  You're not allowed, slave.
[01:18:45.818 --> 01:18:48.279]  They are destroying everything.
[01:18:48.279 --> 01:18:49.040]  Of course they are!
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:55.722]  I mean, they told us it's good to kill 51 million babies in America since 73.
[01:18:55.722 --> 01:18:58.503]  I mean, it's just the government is pure evil.
[01:18:58.503 --> 01:19:00.203]  And people better grow up and realize that.
[01:19:00.203 --> 01:19:01.104]  We're in great danger.
[01:19:01.104 --> 01:19:05.965]  Well, thanks Alex, I appreciate you having me on.
[01:19:05.965 --> 01:19:07.306]  Thank you, I appreciate your call.
[01:19:07.306 --> 01:19:10.567]  And folks, this isn't just some I-wanna-bash government.
[01:19:11.711 --> 01:19:15.275]  We better relearn what the Founding Fathers said.
[01:19:15.275 --> 01:19:19.078]  We better rediscover history and what happens to societies.
[01:19:19.078 --> 01:19:23.002]  Do you understand the globalists want a depression while they tell you everything's great?
[01:19:23.002 --> 01:19:29.728]  They want to destroy society while denying it's happening so they can continue to basically rape and rob us and get away with it.
[01:19:29.728 --> 01:19:32.331]  I mean, this is not a joke!
[01:19:33.715 --> 01:19:36.697]  They're openly merging Canada and Mexico with the U.S.
[01:19:36.697 --> 01:19:38.058]  right now publicly.
[01:19:38.058 --> 01:19:43.462]  It's in major newspapers that, oh, we're going to have foreign troops in America to suppress Americans.
[01:19:43.462 --> 01:19:54.389]  Just incredible things are happening on a daily basis that are just off the charts because the average American only cares about baseball, football, getting drunk.
[01:19:54.389 --> 01:19:56.511]  Well, you're going to get hurt really bad.
[01:19:56.511 --> 01:19:59.353]  People better decide what side they're on and learn to recognize evil.
[01:20:01.536 --> 01:20:03.217]  This is an urgent message.
[01:20:03.217 --> 01:20:05.719]  Urgent if you care about feeding your family.
[01:20:05.719 --> 01:20:10.442]  S-510 has passed through Congress and will make the sale of heirloom seeds difficult.
[01:20:10.442 --> 01:20:16.267]  Prices of non-GMO seeds are skyrocketing and may be hard to afford in the future, if you can even find them.
[01:20:16.267 --> 01:20:23.072]  As the economy continues to decline, this will make the heirloom seeds worth their weight in gold and one of the best barter tools available.
[01:20:23.072 --> 01:20:27.615]  When food supplies eventually run out, your solution is to grow your own food and barter tool.
[01:20:28.055 --> 01:20:35.564]  Now for a short time, GetSeeds.net offers 100 packets of heirloom non-GMO vegetable seeds for only $59.
[01:20:35.564 --> 01:20:39.048]  Pay with 2 ounces of pure silver or just $59.
[01:20:39.048 --> 01:20:41.892]  The best price on the net for high quality seeds.
[01:20:41.892 --> 01:20:47.479]  Our GetSeeds.net seeds are open pollinated vegetable seeds sealed in a mylar bag for long term storage.
[01:20:47.799 --> 01:20:53.266]  Bulk pricing available, so get seeds while you still can at GetSeeds.net or call toll free 877-341-4769.
[01:20:53.266 --> 01:20:53.447]  That's 877-341-4769.
[01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:02.761]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:21:02.761 --> 01:21:03.801]  The real U.S.
[01:21:03.801 --> 01:21:09.103]  unemployment rate is now 22%, and not 9% like what we are told by the mainstream media.
[01:21:09.103 --> 01:21:13.925]  The primary instinct of unemployed Americans is to go to college and seek a higher education.
[01:21:13.925 --> 01:21:19.487]  But all across America, students are graduating with hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt and no jobs.
[01:21:19.887 --> 01:21:28.050]  Most college graduates are now admitting that they would have been better off getting a job at Walmart or McDonald's than having their lives destroyed by student loans.
[01:21:28.050 --> 01:21:38.113]  Our friends at the National Inflation Association are getting ready to release College Conspiracy, the world's most comprehensive documentary ever produced about America's college education system.
[01:21:38.113 --> 01:21:45.556]  To be among the first to see College Conspiracy, sign up for the free NIA newsletter today at www.inflation.us.
[01:21:45.916 --> 01:21:50.079]  NIA believes that college education is the largest scam in American history.

[01:21:54.782 --> 01:21:59.586]  Sign up for free today at inflation.us to be among the first to see College Conspiracy.

[01:23:00.424 --> 01:23:00.924]  The U.S.
[01:23:00.924 --> 01:23:02.946]  economy is at a tipping point.
[01:23:02.946 --> 01:23:06.048]  Forty cents of every dollar the government spends is borrowed.
[01:23:06.048 --> 01:23:14.835]  The President of the Federal Reserve in Dallas was recently quoted saying, this path will lead to insolvency, resulting in the collapse of our government and our economy.
[01:23:14.835 --> 01:23:18.237]  Our country can't function like this, and neither can your household.
[01:23:18.237 --> 01:23:21.980]  That's why you need to prepare, and priority one is your food supply.
[01:23:21.980 --> 01:23:25.423]  Fortunately, it's easy and affordable, with the help of Ready Reserve Foods.
[01:23:25.843 --> 01:23:30.565]  Ready Reserve Foods has been a premier supplier of long-term storable foods for 37 years.

[01:23:51.373 --> 01:23:51.914]  Our memories live on.
[01:24:16.657 --> 01:24:18.218]  We'll ride again.
[01:24:18.218 --> 01:24:24.161]  I am a Midwest farmer.
[01:24:24.161 --> 01:24:26.263]  I make a living off the land.
[01:24:26.263 --> 01:24:28.404]  I ride a John Deere tractor.
[01:24:28.404 --> 01:24:31.446]  I'm a liberated man.
[01:24:31.446 --> 01:24:34.867]  The rain, it hasn't fallen since the middle of July.
[01:24:36.963 --> 01:24:43.086]  Okay, this is a short segment, but for the rest of the hour, Dr. Bob Bowman is our guest.
[01:24:43.086 --> 01:24:44.787]  After he leaves us, we'll continue with some more calls.
[01:24:44.787 --> 01:24:53.372]  We have Dr. Busby joining us, a chemical physicist, one of the top advisors over in England on radiation hazards and poisoning.
[01:24:53.372 --> 01:25:05.378]  Dr. Busby said here over three weeks ago that he believed it was already worse than Chernobyl, that multiple containment facilities had been breached with the intel he had, because he has a lot of people in the International Atomic Energy Agency as contacts.
[01:25:06.438 --> 01:25:08.160]  Uh, and since then, that's been confirmed.
[01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:14.344]  Uh, the New York Times confirmed that fuel rods, when number three blew up, stored on top, were shot over a mile away.
[01:25:14.344 --> 01:25:17.907]  The Japanese just buried them with bulldozers.
[01:25:17.907 --> 01:25:20.148]  Uh, 7.5 million saved times radiation.
[01:25:20.148 --> 01:25:22.670]  Plutonium, uranium going into the ocean.
[01:25:22.670 --> 01:25:23.751]  Still off-gassing.
[01:25:23.751 --> 01:25:25.032]  More earthquakes, they say.
[01:25:25.032 --> 01:25:26.793]  Complete meltdowns could happen.
[01:25:26.793 --> 01:25:31.236]  One reactor's had a 70% meltdown and oozed out of a crack in the breached wall.
[01:25:32.057 --> 01:25:35.559]  And now the Japanese are saying this is from a scale of one to seven.
[01:25:35.559 --> 01:25:37.079]  It's a seven.
[01:25:37.079 --> 01:25:41.221]  As bad as it gets on par with Chernobyl.
[01:25:41.221 --> 01:25:49.365]  And that's with the ongoing cover-up with the governor of the prefecture of Fukushima saying there's a cover-up and people going to the hospital with radiation sickness.
[01:25:49.365 --> 01:25:50.726]  So I'm just setting the table here.
[01:25:50.726 --> 01:25:52.987]  We'll go through these questions with Dr. Bob Bowman.
[01:25:52.987 --> 01:25:58.890]  Also, the EPA is quietly raising safe radiation levels from between 1,000 to 25,000, depending on what
[01:26:02.671 --> 01:26:15.755]  Isotope it is, and 17 states are reporting 300 times safe levels of radioactive iodine and other radioactive isotopes.
[01:26:15.755 --> 01:26:19.896]  So we're going to be going over all of that with Dr. Bob Bowman.
[01:26:19.896 --> 01:26:26.438]  Dr. Bob Bowman, of course, has the website thepatriots.us.
[01:26:26.438 --> 01:26:29.979]  He, of course, flew 101 combat missions in Vietnam.
[01:26:30.859 --> 01:26:32.301]  Bombing missions.
[01:26:32.301 --> 01:26:40.110]  He, of course, was the former head of the Star Wars weapons program and he has three degrees in nuclear physics and aeronautics.
[01:26:40.110 --> 01:26:40.730]  Doesn't need any
[01:26:42.671 --> 01:26:48.997]  You know, real introduction past the fact that he's also awarded the Society of American Military Engineers, ROTC Medal of Merit.
[01:26:48.997 --> 01:26:49.878]  It just goes on and on.
[01:26:49.878 --> 01:26:56.064]  He, of course, has Air Medal with five oak leaf clusters, Meritorious Service Medal.
[01:26:56.064 --> 01:26:59.907]  But the big issue is that he's a nuclear physicist and headed up the secret Star Wars program.
[01:26:59.907 --> 01:27:01.689]  Doctor, good to have you here.
[01:27:01.689 --> 01:27:07.575]  I know we tried to air on the safe side a month ago, but looks like this thing is an ongoing crisis.
[01:27:09.215 --> 01:27:13.457]  Yes Alex, it's pretty much what I predicted at that time.
[01:27:13.457 --> 01:27:25.462]  I said that it looked like it was going to be worse than Chernobyl and it is and I think it has been for weeks.
[01:27:25.462 --> 01:27:30.925]  This level 5 for the last several weeks has been plain ridiculous.
[01:27:33.066 --> 01:27:35.449]  They've been saying level five for three weeks.
[01:27:35.449 --> 01:27:41.776]  Now they admit a cover-up and 7.5 million normal levels.
[01:27:41.776 --> 01:27:44.339]  And that itself they're reporting is probably a cover-up.
[01:27:44.339 --> 01:27:48.604]  Russia Today has got detectors out there and saying they're just pegged off the chart.
[01:27:48.604 --> 01:27:49.646]  What does this look like to you?
[01:27:51.465 --> 01:27:58.988]  Well, it looks to me like the people in a large area of Japan are in serious trouble.
[01:27:58.988 --> 01:28:16.934]  And the Japanese government had better admit that, warn the people, evacuate them, help them move whatever from inside their houses is not contaminated already.
[01:28:18.495 --> 01:28:32.843]  Clean up the people from the radiation on their skin and, you know, let them start a new life considerably west-southwest probably of the radiation area.
[01:28:36.124 --> 01:29:01.065]  Now what about, and I want to go over some of these numbers, 17 states are reporting, first it was 181 times safe levels in the water in Berkeley, now they're reporting in milk 300 times, and they're listing the different isotopes, radioactive nickel, cesium, cesium, I mean this, what do you think of the EPA saying they're going to raise what they say the safe levels are?
[01:29:02.270 --> 01:29:14.038]  Well, first the question is, uh, are these people saying it's 300 times the safe level or 300 times the normal level?
[01:29:14.038 --> 01:29:18.501]  Uh, the news is saying both, so technically, uh, uh, fill us in.
[01:29:18.501 --> 01:29:26.667]  Well, there's a huge difference because the safe level is probably, uh,
[01:29:31.638 --> 01:29:47.071]  100,000 times the normal level that we're exposed to just because we're living here in the United States where the normal level we get from all sources is about one and a half times.
[01:29:47.071 --> 01:29:47.531]  Stay there!
[01:29:47.531 --> 01:29:47.891]  Stay there!
[01:29:47.891 --> 01:29:48.412]  We got a break!
[01:29:48.412 --> 01:29:51.074]  Got a break!
[01:29:51.074 --> 01:29:52.475]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.475 --> 01:29:54.997]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.997 --> 01:29:57.700]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.952 --> 01:30:05.976]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:30:05.976 --> 01:30:09.220]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:30:09.220 --> 01:30:14.025]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[01:30:14.025 --> 01:30:20.411]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:30:20.411 --> 01:30:22.654]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:30:23.154 --> 01:30:24.655]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:30:24.655 --> 01:30:25.956]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:30:25.956 --> 01:30:28.197]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:30:42.085 --> 01:30:44.226]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:30:44.226 --> 01:30:49.349]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:30:49.349 --> 01:30:58.475]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:31:00.416 --> 01:31:04.980]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:31:04.980 --> 01:31:05.900]  Number 1.
[01:31:05.900 --> 01:31:09.323]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:31:09.323 --> 01:31:10.184]  Number 2.
[01:31:10.184 --> 01:31:15.068]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:31:15.068 --> 01:31:15.828]  It's true.
[01:31:15.828 --> 01:31:20.692]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:31:20.692 --> 01:31:21.513]  Number 3.
[01:31:21.513 --> 01:31:25.096]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:31:25.096 --> 01:31:28.799]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:31:28.999 --> 01:31:29.799]  Number 4.
[01:31:29.799 --> 01:31:32.540]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:31:32.540 --> 01:31:36.242]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:31:36.242 --> 01:31:37.022]  Number 5.
[01:31:37.022 --> 01:31:41.164]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:31:41.164 --> 01:31:46.226]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:31:46.226 --> 01:31:50.407]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:31:50.407 --> 01:31:52.188]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:32:00.313 --> 01:32:01.494]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:32:01.494 --> 01:32:08.421]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:32:08.421 --> 01:32:10.983]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:32:10.983 --> 01:32:16.348]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:32:16.348 --> 01:32:19.411]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:32:19.411 --> 01:32:21.453]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:32:21.693 --> 01:32:27.958]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:32:27.958 --> 01:32:31.340]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:32:31.340 --> 01:32:37.124]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:32:37.124 --> 01:32:38.765]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:32:38.765 --> 01:32:40.046]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:32:40.046 --> 01:32:42.728]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:32:42.728 --> 01:32:46.951]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:32:46.951 --> 01:32:48.993]  You can find the video at www.

[01:32:51.556 --> 01:32:52.697]  That's End of America.
[01:32:52.697 --> 01:32:54.159]  The number 3 dot com.

[01:33:01.229 --> 01:33:06.276]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:10.501 --> 01:33:11.923]  On due through Friday, 11 a.m.
[01:33:11.923 --> 01:33:12.584]  to 2 p.m.
[01:33:12.584 --> 01:33:17.890]  Central, back Sundays, 4 to 6 p.m., Dr. Bob Bowman, nuclear physicist, is our guest.
[01:33:17.890 --> 01:33:19.833]  You got interrupted by the break.
[01:33:19.833 --> 01:33:21.354]  Sorry about that.
[01:33:21.354 --> 01:33:23.918]  Reporting here from the EPA's own website.
[01:33:25.465 --> 01:33:37.298]  They are reporting that they are going to raise the new standards nearly 1,000-fold for exposure to strontium-90, 3,000 to 100,000-fold hike for exposure to iodine-131, and almost 25,000 rise for exposure to radioactive nickel-63, and they are reporting 300 times
[01:33:47.727 --> 01:33:51.870]  300 times higher levels is all they say.
[01:33:51.870 --> 01:33:53.971]  They don't say normal or safe.
[01:33:53.971 --> 01:34:01.175]  They just say higher levels in 17 states that have done the test.
[01:34:01.175 --> 01:34:03.097]  And the feds aren't even releasing numbers.
[01:34:03.097 --> 01:34:11.462]  These are universities and state groups from Washington to California, from Pennsylvania to New York, from Alabama to Ohio.
[01:34:12.603 --> 01:34:16.047]  But you were explaining there that the U.S.
[01:34:16.047 --> 01:34:20.552]  already has a certain radiation level background.
[01:34:20.552 --> 01:34:21.153]  Please continue.
[01:34:22.915 --> 01:34:33.125]  Yeah, the background radiation in the United States is about one and a half times the average in the rest of the world.
[01:34:33.125 --> 01:34:36.869]  It's twice what it is in Australia.
[01:34:36.869 --> 01:34:44.557]  And that radiation is about three millisieverts a year in the United States.
[01:34:44.557 --> 01:34:44.877]  Now the
[01:34:48.542 --> 01:35:02.149]  Threshold for known carcinogenic effects, in other words, giving you cancer, is about a hundred millisieverts a year.
[01:35:02.149 --> 01:35:11.533]  For radiation sickness, the threshold is much higher than that.
[01:35:11.533 --> 01:35:14.915]  It's about one to three
[01:35:16.682 --> 01:35:27.205]  Severts a year so what a thousand to three thousand millisieverts a year to start getting No, I'm sorry.
[01:35:27.205 --> 01:35:41.228]  That's in one day so the the yearly dose Would have to be You know 360 times that so about a thousand
[01:35:42.764 --> 01:35:44.186]  I don't
[01:36:00.899 --> 01:36:12.109]  The bottom line is that we have to be careful here in the United States about the food supply, particularly about anything that comes from Japan.
[01:36:12.109 --> 01:36:14.712]  It could be in our fish.
[01:36:14.712 --> 01:36:24.200]  It could get into the food chain in the United States because of fallout on the grass, which is eaten by cows and other animals.
[01:36:25.490 --> 01:36:34.518]  That is a form of radiation that got into the food supply in Europe after Chernobyl.
[01:36:34.518 --> 01:36:44.147]  But of course, those areas of Europe, Finland and whatnot, were much closer to Chernobyl than we are to Fukushima.
[01:36:44.147 --> 01:36:49.873]  So, there'll be a lot less of that here in the United States.
[01:36:51.129 --> 01:36:56.506]  There will be some fallout and there will be some people in the United States getting cancer.
[01:36:57.945 --> 01:37:10.858]  You won't be able to tell which cancers came from this radiation and which are from some other source, unless there's a particular kind of cancer.
[01:37:10.858 --> 01:37:21.828]  Unfortunately, there's not a particular kind of cancer that identifies itself and says, uh-huh, that's by golly from radioactive fallout.
[01:37:23.886 --> 01:37:32.373]  You can get all sorts of different cancers, including the same kind of cancers that you get from your normal exposure.
[01:37:32.373 --> 01:37:50.508]  And by the way, smokers get some 30,000 times as much radiation as someone who lives next door to a nuclear power plant.
[01:37:52.030 --> 01:38:00.520]  So explain that because there's there's isotopes in the tobacco Yeah the
[01:38:07.093 --> 01:38:12.180]  There are radioactive isotopes in just about everything, including in the human body.
[01:38:12.180 --> 01:38:18.608]  You actually get a certain dose from sleeping next to another person.
[01:38:18.608 --> 01:38:22.273]  You get a small dose from eating a banana.
[01:38:24.741 --> 01:38:43.754]  When you add up all the normal things, including the background radiation, the radiation from the soil, from the sky, and all the rest of it, then you get your normal total background radiation, which a normal person gets, which is about 3.
[01:38:47.375 --> 01:38:51.116]  Millie Sieberts per year.
[01:38:51.116 --> 01:38:54.458]  And so that's what's considered sort of normal.
[01:38:54.458 --> 01:39:10.703]  And these figures that are coming out that say 300 times normal, my guess is that they're talking about 300 times that number, which is still considerably less than a smoker gets or
[01:39:13.398 --> 01:39:19.922]  And orders of magnitude too small to give anyone radiation sickness.
[01:39:19.922 --> 01:39:30.728]  You see, these cancers that you get can come with a fairly small dose.
[01:39:30.728 --> 01:39:36.151]  And the cancer rate in this country will increase imperceptibly, probably.
[01:39:36.151 --> 01:39:41.655]  You probably won't see it show up in the statistics, but there will probably be
[01:39:43.872 --> 01:39:57.487]  A few thousand unlucky people who just happened to breathe in a piece of radioactive plutonium that fell out of the jet stream.
[01:39:58.764 --> 01:40:04.307]  And they happen to breathe it into their lungs and it gets stuck there and it causes cancer.
[01:40:04.307 --> 01:40:13.753]  Yeah, so to explain, you have the general background, but that's what Dr. Christopher Busby has said as well, but then there's the actual particles that just add to the overall background.
[01:40:13.753 --> 01:40:22.038]  But if you were to inhale one of those that's many times more radioactive than just the background, and then it sits there in your lungs, that's what's really going to get you.
[01:40:22.038 --> 01:40:24.359]  And we've got him coming on for 30 minutes in the next hour, Dr. Busby,
[01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:26.120]  I think?
[01:40:43.772 --> 01:40:44.432]  Absolutely.
[01:40:44.432 --> 01:40:45.552]  There is no really safe level.
[01:40:45.552 --> 01:40:48.353]  Radiation, even just the background radiation that we all get every day,
[01:41:13.709 --> 01:41:23.432]  If it gets you in the right place, it can cause cancer.
[01:41:23.432 --> 01:41:32.375]  And because of that, there's really no safe level.
[01:41:32.375 --> 01:41:39.417]  But on the other hand, the level for getting radiation sickness is so much higher
[01:41:40.307 --> 01:41:58.619]  That nobody in this country needs to worry about that unless you get a fish right out of the waters off Fukushima and you eat it and get a massive dose inside your body.
[01:41:58.619 --> 01:42:06.665]  So we're not talking about a fast kill, we're talking about just adding to the overall morbidity numbers of the population, Dr. Bowman.
[01:42:07.365 --> 01:42:15.180]  Absolutely, and we've already had some of that from Chernobyl because the effects of Chernobyl went around the world.
[01:42:17.955 --> 01:42:21.997]  The radiation levels increased here in the United States.
[01:42:21.997 --> 01:42:23.537]  We could detect that.
[01:42:23.537 --> 01:42:39.464]  They're going to be higher this time from Fukushima, considerably higher, but not enough to make anyone sick, but certainly enough that there will be a lot of people get cancer and never know that it came from radiation.
[01:42:39.784 --> 01:42:41.686]  Okay, let's expand on that.
[01:42:41.686 --> 01:42:45.629]  Why does Australia have half the background radiation that the United States does?
[01:42:45.629 --> 01:42:48.932]  Is that because of all the nuclear above-ground testing that went on?
[01:42:51.710 --> 01:43:08.299]  There may be some of that, but I think after a period of time, the mixing of the atmosphere is such that the fallout from that is now pretty evenly spread.
[01:43:08.299 --> 01:43:15.043]  But there's no question that the fallout from atmospheric testing and from Chernobyl
[01:43:16.321 --> 01:43:25.709]  Uh, fell out into the Earth and the grass of the Northern Hemisphere a lot more than it did the Southern Hemisphere.
[01:43:25.709 --> 01:43:27.970]  Oh, so Chernobyl's the main issue.
[01:43:27.970 --> 01:43:35.136]  And within a month it had circled the globe, according to detectors, in 1986.
[01:43:35.136 --> 01:43:41.141]  What do you think of Ann Coulter's statement on the right, but also on the left, the big one-worlder
[01:43:41.921 --> 01:43:47.164]  George Monbiot for the London Guardian saying he now is for nuclear power because of the disaster.
[01:43:47.164 --> 01:43:48.744]  A very bizarre Orwellian statement.
[01:43:48.744 --> 01:43:57.108]  She said the Japanese ought to be thankful that this radiation will now make sure, quote, that they don't get cancer, which is an asinine statement.
[01:43:57.108 --> 01:44:03.231]  Obviously, they can use neutron beam and other things to fry a certain cancer, then that damages surrounding tissue.
[01:44:03.231 --> 01:44:09.314]  Once you have a cancer, because it kills the cells, but this is a general damaging of the DNA and the cells.
[01:44:09.314 --> 01:44:10.655]  So I guess I'm answering the question for you.
[01:44:11.095 --> 01:44:16.718]  Why do you think they're making these bizarre statements about how the Japanese should be thankful?
[01:44:16.718 --> 01:44:23.041]  Well, Ann Coulter, I think, is just plain ridiculous.
[01:44:23.041 --> 01:44:36.447]  I've thought that for a long time, and these latest statements about, little radiation is good for you, is just another confirmation of how off the wall she is, along with a lot of other people out there.
[01:44:37.423 --> 01:44:38.084]  But why?
[01:44:38.084 --> 01:44:39.865]  I mean, they can't be that stupid.
[01:44:39.865 --> 01:44:41.547]  Is this just a throwing it in our face?
[01:44:41.547 --> 01:44:58.443]  No, I really think it's, you know, taking a little bit of misinformation and misconstruing it and I really think it is stupidity.
[01:44:58.443 --> 01:45:00.225]  I really don't see any
[01:45:01.576 --> 01:45:12.919]  Reason why a person who knows better would say something like that have anything to gain from it whatsoever.
[01:45:12.919 --> 01:45:14.400]  It is discrediting.
[01:45:14.400 --> 01:45:21.042]  ABC News is reporting that the Simi Valley nuclear meltdown still impacts lives.
[01:45:21.042 --> 01:45:22.082]  That happened in 59.
[01:45:22.082 --> 01:45:27.404]  They kept it secret for decades and they say that's the second biggest nuclear disaster after Chernobyl.
[01:45:28.745 --> 01:45:33.588]  I guess soon it's going to be eclipsed now by Fukushima, but they kept that secret.
[01:45:33.588 --> 01:45:40.013]  That was the first operational power-based, power-supplying reactor, they say, in the U.S.
[01:45:40.013 --> 01:45:41.915]  And I know you've worked all over the U.S.
[01:45:41.915 --> 01:45:44.537]  in the Star Wars program.
[01:45:44.537 --> 01:45:56.126]  This really is a segue into the politics of this and the nuclear industry basically getting behind a program of putting a psychological salve on this, whitewashing it.
[01:45:56.886 --> 01:45:59.408]  Telling us everything's fine.
[01:45:59.408 --> 01:46:01.950]  What do you think should come out of this Fukushima disaster?
[01:46:01.950 --> 01:46:03.711]  A. But B. What do you think is going to come out of it?
[01:46:05.049 --> 01:46:18.358]  Well, what should come out of it is that we can't just shut down all the nuclear power plants because, you know, we're pregnant on nuclear electricity and we've got to live with it for now.
[01:46:18.358 --> 01:46:26.103]  But we ought to shut down one nuclear power plant at a time and replace it with a modern
[01:46:26.943 --> 01:46:40.396]  Nuclear power plant that is much safer Like a thorium molten salt reactor There are designs of reactors that are self quenching.
[01:46:40.396 --> 01:46:45.701]  You don't have to have an emergency water supply the
[01:46:47.881 --> 01:46:49.663]  The stuff will go out on its own.
[01:47:06.809 --> 01:47:08.310]  Right, exactly.
[01:47:08.310 --> 01:47:19.337]  And, you know, if we had somebody in the government with some guts, they'd say, OK, we shut down this one.
[01:47:19.337 --> 01:47:23.040]  I'd pick Indian Point first because it's so close to New York City.
[01:47:23.040 --> 01:47:24.801]  Shut it down.
[01:47:24.801 --> 01:47:28.403]  One reactor vessel at a time.
[01:47:28.403 --> 01:47:30.125]  Replace it with a modern one.
[01:47:31.184 --> 01:47:31.444]  I don't
[01:47:54.091 --> 01:47:58.455]  And this would create jobs, which we need in a recession.
[01:47:58.455 --> 01:48:04.540]  You know, everybody is talking about, you gotta cut spending.
[01:48:04.540 --> 01:48:10.165]  Well, that's exactly the wrong thing to do in a recession or a depression.
[01:48:10.165 --> 01:48:11.786]  The government has to spend money to
[01:48:17.046 --> 01:48:17.747]  I don't think so.
[01:48:34.884 --> 01:48:37.365]  They're going to the offshore secret banks.
[01:48:37.365 --> 01:48:40.667]  Give them the trillions and the Republicans, oh, don't touch the bankers' trillions.
[01:48:40.667 --> 01:48:47.030]  Obama, don't touch the bankers' trillions in derivatives we're having to pay for that we don't owe.
[01:48:47.030 --> 01:48:49.571]  Let's kick people off food stamps.
[01:48:49.571 --> 01:48:52.953]  In an imploding economy, all that's going to create is civil unrest.
[01:48:52.953 --> 01:49:01.877]  And Dr. Bowman, do you agree that they're scapegoating people that are the poorest Americans and claiming they're the reason we're having economic problems when it doesn't even enter the equation?
[01:49:02.737 --> 01:49:03.777]  Absolutely.
[01:49:03.777 --> 01:49:04.957]  You bet.
[01:49:04.957 --> 01:49:24.541]  And what should happen again is abolish the Federal Reserve, audit all the big banks, and those who are insolvent should be nationalized, and then they can loan money at very low interest rates and get the economy working again.
[01:49:28.274 --> 01:49:50.099]  You know, the Rothschilds, the global banking empires, that's as much a reason why we're in these stupid wars as the oil, because the countries we're going after, Iraq and Afghanistan and Libya and Venezuela, all those countries that we label as enemies,
[01:49:51.138 --> 01:49:51.959]  Our country is
[01:50:09.769 --> 01:50:11.751]  And they can thumb their nose.
[01:50:11.751 --> 01:50:14.753]  I mean, that's what Gaddafi was doing.
[01:50:14.753 --> 01:50:27.444]  He used his own money to do enormous public works programs, bringing water from aquifers under the desert to the cities, making the desert bloom.
[01:50:29.693 --> 01:50:34.917]  Huge projects, not ever borrowing a dime from the global bankers.
[01:50:34.917 --> 01:50:37.279]  And of course the global bankers don't like that.
[01:50:37.279 --> 01:50:42.263]  And the first thing they did once they took over the East was set up a new central bank and oil company.
[01:50:42.263 --> 01:50:44.504]  And they've got Al-Qaeda as the good guys now.
[01:50:44.504 --> 01:50:46.846]  And if you don't like Al-Qaeda, you're un-American.
[01:50:46.846 --> 01:50:50.489]  But I know Dr. Bob Bowman, then I guess you're un-American, because I know you don't like Al-Qaeda.
[01:50:50.489 --> 01:50:52.751]  We'll talk about Al-Cieda when we come back.
[01:50:52.751 --> 01:50:54.732]  But Dr. Bob Bowman on the other side.
[01:50:54.732 --> 01:50:56.533]  ThePatriots.us is his website.
[01:50:56.533 --> 01:50:57.955]  Our website's InfoWars.com.
[01:50:57.955 --> 01:50:58.355]  Stay with us.
[01:51:01.052 --> 01:51:02.353]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.353 --> 01:51:07.936]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:07.936 --> 01:51:12.959]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:12.959 --> 01:51:18.002]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:51:18.522 --> 01:51:23.744]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:23.744 --> 01:51:30.867]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:30.867 --> 01:51:31.987]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:31.987 --> 01:51:38.330]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:38.670 --> 01:51:41.852]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:41.852 --> 01:51:44.074]  That's survivalseedbank.com.

[01:51:44.955 --> 01:51:45.215]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:51:45.215 --> 01:51:48.657]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:48.657 --> 01:51:50.419]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:00.586 --> 01:52:07.435]  Dr. David Barry has provided excellent advice for all those interested in practical economics and sound money.
[01:52:07.435 --> 01:52:09.037]  It's certainly worth reading.
[01:52:09.037 --> 01:52:16.888]  That's what Congressman Ron Paul said about Cha-Ching Wisdom, 123 Practical Universal Truths About Money, the new book by Dr. David Barry.
[01:52:17.108 --> 01:52:25.033]  The cool part of this book, certainly it'll speak to you personally, your life, your lifestyle, your money, your investments, but it also can be generalized into the nation.
[01:52:25.033 --> 01:52:26.114]  What's going on as a nation?
[01:52:26.114 --> 01:52:28.896]  We do these same things personally that we do as a nation.
[01:52:28.896 --> 01:52:38.723]  Dr. Berry's book, Cha-Ching Wisdom, presents many facets of your relationship with the once almighty dollar and how current national and international politics affect your daily life.
[01:52:38.723 --> 01:52:40.444]  Some of the other things are about that.
[01:52:40.444 --> 01:52:42.045]  They're not just economic.
[01:52:42.045 --> 01:52:43.066]  They're philosophical.
[01:52:43.066 --> 01:52:44.767]  There's psychology involved in this book.
[01:52:44.767 --> 01:52:46.108]  There's philosophy involved in this book.

[01:53:19.006 --> 01:53:22.789]  Just one of eleven great songs from their album Under the Sun.

[01:54:15.071 --> 01:54:20.476]  Dr. Bob Bowman, nuclear physicist, former head of the Star Wars program, is our guest for another five minutes.
[01:54:20.476 --> 01:54:22.898]  Then in the next five minutes, I'll get to some of these callers that have been holding.
[01:54:22.898 --> 01:54:28.242]  Then Dr. Busby's on for about 30 minutes, then I'll continue with calls and other news on the economy.
[01:54:28.242 --> 01:54:36.449]  Dr. Bob Bowman, you know, we tell people, I mean, the history of Al-Qaeda being globalist created, being used against the Serbs, the Russians before that.
[01:54:37.611 --> 01:54:48.044]  Now the commander of the rebels is admittedly Al-Qaeda and was held in a black site and I guess re-educated and then admits he sent Al-Qaeda fighters to Iraq to kill U.S.
[01:54:48.044 --> 01:54:52.630]  troops and they just openly say, yeah, the core of these people is Al-Qaeda.
[01:54:53.291 --> 01:54:54.651]  And you talk about economics.
[01:54:54.651 --> 01:55:03.933]  Every country that doesn't allow a globalist central bank, like Serbia, whether they're good, bad, or indifferent, the point is they don't want any independent, sovereign nations out there.
[01:55:03.933 --> 01:55:19.556]  And what's your view dealing with 9-11 and that inside job, as a military man, as an American patriot, and the fact that they think we're so stupid now that they're admitting Amir al-Awlaki, the number one operative commander under bin Laden, is secretly hanging out at the Pentagon.
[01:55:19.556 --> 01:55:22.357]  It comes out in AP, Fox News, nobody gets in trouble.
[01:55:22.737 --> 01:55:26.303]  I mean this is getting more and more naked, isn't it?
[01:55:26.303 --> 01:55:28.186]  Yeah, it's ridiculous.
[01:55:29.784 --> 01:55:40.051]  We have been doing for decades anything that needed doing in order to uphold American empire.
[01:55:40.051 --> 01:55:46.015]  And it's really sort of almost an American-British empire.
[01:55:46.015 --> 01:55:51.639]  For a while we were their junior partner, and now they're our junior partner.
[01:55:51.639 --> 01:55:58.704]  But it's all for empire, and we kick out
[01:55:59.989 --> 01:56:10.794]  Independent leaders around the world and install puppet dictators who will sell out their own people for our multinational corporations.
[01:56:10.794 --> 01:56:15.717]  And it happens again and again and again and we keep doing it.
[01:56:15.717 --> 01:56:25.262]  And most of these independent dictators, if you will, at one time were CIA employees.
[01:56:26.683 --> 01:56:30.886]  Most of them got their position with the help of the CIA and
[01:56:33.911 --> 01:56:46.615]  Then, after they got strong enough, then they started becoming independent and thumbing their nose at what their American bosses wanted them to do.
[01:56:46.615 --> 01:56:58.960]  And one after another, whether it's Somoza or Noriega or Barak or Saddam, he was put in power by the CIA.
[01:56:58.960 --> 01:57:01.681]  One after another, then we have to go fight them.
[01:57:02.937 --> 01:57:10.847]  And fight them and they're using weapons that we gave them or sold them.
[01:57:10.847 --> 01:57:16.654]  And we're fighting fighters that we trained, the CIA trained.
[01:57:16.654 --> 01:57:21.981]  The whole thing is ridiculous and what we need to do is end the empire.
[01:57:23.579 --> 01:57:30.224]  And use our armed forces to protect our borders and our people, period.
[01:57:30.224 --> 01:57:35.007]  Not the global financial interests of multinational corporations and banks.
[01:57:53.659 --> 01:57:54.839]  Absolutely.
[01:57:54.839 --> 01:57:58.360]  We aren't getting the benefit financially.
[01:57:58.360 --> 01:58:07.363]  That's going to the global banksters and multinational corporations that don't pay us any taxes anyway.
[01:58:07.363 --> 01:58:10.704]  We're losing out all the way around.
[01:58:11.244 --> 01:58:18.946]  Monetarily, we're losing out with the lives of our sons and daughters being used as cannon fodder in their corporate wars of aggression.
[01:58:18.946 --> 01:58:22.468]  And we're losing our constitutional rights.
[01:58:22.468 --> 01:58:31.791]  The American people are getting screwed all the way around by both the Republican and Democratic parties who are owned by these global money interests.
[01:58:31.791 --> 01:58:33.411]  Dr. Bob Bowman, we're out of time.
[01:58:33.411 --> 01:58:36.712]  ThePatriots.us, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:58:36.712 --> 01:58:38.293]  We'll talk to you again in the near future.
[01:58:38.293 --> 01:58:39.293]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[01:58:42.409 --> 01:58:46.111]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:46.111 --> 01:58:51.155]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:51.155 --> 01:58:58.099]  Over the last year, Alex has told you about and many of you have experienced emergencies and disasters in unprecedented numbers.
[01:58:58.099 --> 01:59:00.741]  People have had to literally run for their lives.
[01:59:00.741 --> 01:59:03.182]  Folks, this is Steve Schenck with eFoods Direct.
[01:59:03.182 --> 01:59:07.565]  I'm not here to scare you, but when disaster strikes, you won't have time to think.
[01:59:07.565 --> 01:59:09.046]  You must act automatically.
[01:59:09.266 --> 01:59:12.769]  What does a pilot do when the helicopter engine fails in flight?
[01:59:12.769 --> 01:59:15.552]  No time to think, just act automatically.
[01:59:15.552 --> 01:59:23.900]  When the alert is broadcast, the alarm sounds, or the knock comes on your door, you'll need to be ready to act without thinking of what to do or what you need.
[01:59:23.900 --> 01:59:26.683]  You need a 5-Day Extreme Emergency Kit.
[01:59:26.923 --> 01:59:36.613]  With serious supplies and real food to secure two adults for five days, this powerful $300 Extreme Emergency Kit is free with an order of at least $995 from eFoodsDirect.
[01:59:36.613 --> 01:59:38.815]  Go to eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex or call 800-409-5633.
[01:59:38.815 --> 01:59:41.218]  That's eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex, 800-409-5633.
[01:59:53.812 --> 01:59:56.193]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.193 --> 02:00:05.555]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.555 --> 02:00:06.855]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.855 --> 02:00:08.636]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.636 --> 02:00:09.816]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:09.816 --> 02:00:11.976]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.976 --> 02:00:13.517]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.517 --> 02:00:17.718]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.718 --> 02:00:21.799]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:29.057 --> 02:00:36.598]  Dr. Christopher Busby, chemical physicist, joining us to break down the incredible developments in Fukushima coming up in the next segment from England.
[02:00:36.598 --> 02:00:39.419]  Right now it's Jammin', some more of your calls after he leaves us at the bottom of the hour.
[02:00:39.419 --> 02:00:41.019]  We'll continue with the calls and news.
[02:00:41.019 --> 02:00:42.159]  Ralph in Texas.
[02:00:42.159 --> 02:00:43.599]  Ralph, you're on the air.
[02:00:43.599 --> 02:00:44.419]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:00:44.419 --> 02:00:47.960]  Are you looking for Ross?
[02:00:47.960 --> 02:00:49.100]  Okay, we'll call you Ross.
[02:00:49.100 --> 02:00:50.400]  Ross, go ahead.
[02:00:50.400 --> 02:00:53.281]  Hey Alex, God bless you and thank you for so much for what you're doing for us.
[02:00:54.289 --> 02:01:03.855]  Alex, I just wanted to tell you, when I had the opportunity to read your article and see the video about the six-year-old girl being molested by the TSA, I absolutely lost it.
[02:01:03.855 --> 02:01:09.699]  I can't believe how complacent a mother was and the American people to keep allowing this to happen.
[02:01:09.699 --> 02:01:17.764]  God didn't give me children, but I have to tell you the reason He didn't is because I would be in jail, because I would have been all over that situation.
[02:01:17.764 --> 02:01:20.546]  Well, that's because you still have your common sense and your humanity.
[02:01:20.546 --> 02:01:20.886]  Go ahead.
[02:01:22.034 --> 02:01:29.481]  I just, um, I'm actually shaking inside because I just can't believe that our country has come to this.
[02:01:29.481 --> 02:01:32.663]  Well, the next step is herding people into pits and shooting them in the back of the head.
[02:01:32.663 --> 02:01:37.467]  I mean, the Nazis did this same thing where they trained people to put their hands on them at first.
[02:01:37.467 --> 02:01:39.049]  Think about this, Alex.
[02:01:39.049 --> 02:01:43.773]  What if that little girl came back with a so-called positive urine test or blood test?
[02:01:44.403 --> 02:01:47.546]  First off, that little girl is traumatized for the rest of her life.
[02:01:47.546 --> 02:01:54.392]  And think about this, what if those pedophiles that stand behind those screens watching this decided that was one of the children they wanted to get into CPS?
[02:01:54.392 --> 02:01:59.516]  Well, they've already been doing that and caught, and they've already been caught stealing people's goods and everything else you can list.
[02:01:59.516 --> 02:02:01.658]  I mean, they're hiring a bunch of crooks at TSA.
[02:02:03.593 --> 02:02:11.579]  Alex, the Bible teaches us that we're supposed to shout out the injustices that are happening in our country, and I guess this is... That's right!
[02:02:11.579 --> 02:02:20.346]  The Bible says it a hundred times or more, and the churches are financed by the government now, and controlled, so they say, no, we're supposed to love this!
[02:02:20.346 --> 02:02:21.267]  This is good!
[02:02:21.267 --> 02:02:24.670]  Hand your children over to Moloch!
[02:02:24.670 --> 02:02:26.351]  No, no, that's the worst thing we can do.
[02:02:26.351 --> 02:02:28.713]  Our children are the most precious thing that God has given us.
[02:02:29.488 --> 02:02:37.490]  And for this to keep going on, I'm beside myself at the complacency of the American people.
[02:02:37.490 --> 02:02:44.851]  If I had seen something like that happen in public to somebody's child, I would have physically intervened and snatched that child up.
[02:02:44.851 --> 02:02:47.252]  I might end up in jail, but at least I've been doing the right thing.
[02:02:47.252 --> 02:02:48.192]  Well, that's what this is.
[02:02:48.192 --> 02:02:51.753]  This is a test to break our will and normalize this activity.
[02:02:51.753 --> 02:02:52.733]  We've got to say no.
[02:02:52.733 --> 02:02:53.353]  Thank you, Ralph.
[02:02:53.353 --> 02:02:55.634]  The video's up on InfoWars.com.
[02:02:55.634 --> 02:02:57.334]  Susie in Wisconsin, you're on the air.
[02:03:01.092 --> 02:03:02.013]  Or the last guy was Ross.
[02:03:02.013 --> 02:03:03.775]  Yes, Susie, go ahead.
[02:03:03.775 --> 02:03:17.446]  Hi, I wanted to contribute that yesterday I picked up my nieces from public school and the first thing my niece says to me is radiation is good for us.
[02:03:17.446 --> 02:03:21.189]  So they're teaching them in the public schools that radiation is good for them.
[02:03:21.189 --> 02:03:23.031]  Just a little bit of radiation is okay for us.
[02:03:25.447 --> 02:03:26.648]  Evidently so.
[02:03:26.648 --> 02:03:31.170]  Well, you just heard a nuclear physicist, former head of the Star Wars program, say that that's a lie.
[02:03:31.170 --> 02:03:33.812]  And we know it's a lie.
[02:03:33.812 --> 02:03:36.033]  But this is how these people operate.
[02:03:36.033 --> 02:03:40.036]  So, I mean, did you ask her specifically what she was taught?
[02:03:40.036 --> 02:03:40.776]  No.
[02:03:40.776 --> 02:03:48.601]  It was one of her teachers in conversation, and that's one of the first things she told me that she learned today in school.
[02:03:48.601 --> 02:03:55.005]  Of course, the South Koreans are staying indoors and wearing masks, but I guess they're evil.
[02:03:56.072 --> 02:04:08.201]  Yeah, and then just the fact of the dumbifying our children and there's no longer cursive writing being taught in the schools either.
[02:04:08.201 --> 02:04:14.346]  And so now they won't be able to read past generations journals.
[02:04:14.346 --> 02:04:16.668]  She won't be able to read what I write in my diaries.
[02:04:18.240 --> 02:04:20.282]  Well, that's what 1984 is all about.
[02:04:20.282 --> 02:04:31.671]  Removing the language, dumbing everything down, shortening the rote of the language, condensing things where people can't communicate.
[02:04:31.671 --> 02:04:33.133]  It's all being done scientifically.
[02:04:33.133 --> 02:04:40.759]  We've had the former head of the Department of Education Policy on Charlotte Iserby to break that down, and she has all the documents in her book.
[02:04:40.759 --> 02:04:41.159]  We're good to go.
[02:05:02.606 --> 02:05:05.088]  And you're subject to other police action.
[02:05:05.088 --> 02:05:06.350]  Tyranny is here.
[02:05:06.350 --> 02:05:09.893]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:05:09.893 --> 02:05:12.515]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:05:12.515 --> 02:05:17.940]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:05:18.380 --> 02:05:25.046]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:05:25.046 --> 02:05:31.031]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:05:31.031 --> 02:05:34.734]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[02:05:35.194 --> 02:05:39.476]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:05:39.476 --> 02:05:45.439]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:05:45.439 --> 02:05:48.980]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:05:48.980 --> 02:05:50.961]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:05:50.961 --> 02:05:52.102]  It's here.

[02:06:13.060 --> 02:06:27.784]  There's a place down in Tennessee Where they make blue diamond gusset jeans They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you'll love the way they fit
[02:06:30.288 --> 02:06:34.891]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[02:06:34.891 --> 02:06:39.954]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it, others don't.
[02:06:39.954 --> 02:06:42.095]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:06:42.095 --> 02:06:43.876]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:06:43.876 --> 02:06:46.758]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.

[02:06:56.104 --> 02:06:58.965]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it, others don't.
[02:07:00.438 --> 02:07:04.981]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:07:04.981 --> 02:07:05.901]  Number 1.
[02:07:05.901 --> 02:07:09.324]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:07:09.324 --> 02:07:10.184]  Number 2.
[02:07:10.184 --> 02:07:15.067]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:07:15.067 --> 02:07:15.828]  It's true.
[02:07:15.828 --> 02:07:20.691]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:07:20.691 --> 02:07:21.511]  Number 3.
[02:07:21.511 --> 02:07:25.114]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:07:25.114 --> 02:07:28.816]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:07:28.996 --> 02:07:29.796]  Number 4.
[02:07:29.796 --> 02:07:32.558]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:07:32.558 --> 02:07:36.239]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:07:36.239 --> 02:07:37.039]  Number 5.
[02:07:37.039 --> 02:07:41.181]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:07:41.181 --> 02:07:46.223]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:07:46.223 --> 02:07:50.405]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:50.405 --> 02:07:52.206]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[02:07:57.228 --> 02:08:03.153]  The next 30 minutes or so, Dr. Christopher Busby is our guest.
[02:08:03.153 --> 02:08:06.755]  He advises EU research commissions, the BBC.
[02:08:06.755 --> 02:08:13.381]  He, of course, is also a professor PhD from the University of Kent.
[02:08:28.133 --> 02:08:33.987]  Researching Rama spectro electrochemistry he's a chemical physicist
[02:08:35.180 --> 02:08:38.662]  And he was on with this more than three weeks ago, a week or so into this crisis.
[02:08:38.662 --> 02:08:41.604]  He said, look, this is already as bad or worse than Chernobyl.
[02:08:41.604 --> 02:08:42.525]  There's a cover-up.
[02:08:42.525 --> 02:08:43.746]  We saw the MOX-1 No.
[02:08:43.746 --> 02:08:46.888]  3 reactor blow up, shooting fuel rods everywhere.
[02:08:46.888 --> 02:08:47.508]  It's now admitted.
[02:08:47.508 --> 02:08:49.530]  The Japanese document's been released.
[02:08:49.530 --> 02:09:02.719]  The New York Times buried it, but did report that they just covered it upwards of a mile away, spent fuel rods by the thousands, the hundreds of thousands, with bulldozers, 7.5 million times normal levels of radiation being pumped.
[02:09:03.579 --> 02:09:03.699]  Yeah.
[02:09:24.420 --> 02:09:26.922]  The Chinese are responding the same way here.
[02:09:54.366 --> 02:09:55.580]  But they're saying this is safe.
[02:09:57.225 --> 02:10:03.708]  And you've got the media with Ann Coulter and others running around saying that this is wonderful.
[02:10:03.708 --> 02:10:07.710]  We've also got Mambiatas, we talked about a few weeks ago, saying he's all for nuclear power now.
[02:10:07.710 --> 02:10:09.211]  This really shows that it's great.
[02:10:09.211 --> 02:10:13.634]  They make these nonsensical statements to just shock us into submission.
[02:10:13.634 --> 02:10:17.656]  But Dr. Busby joins us to break down the latest developments at Fukushima.
[02:10:17.656 --> 02:10:22.758]  They now admit as bad a number seven, and that's the highest on the scale for a nuclear disaster.
[02:10:22.758 --> 02:10:25.680]  And they say it may keep going on for months or even longer.
[02:10:26.920 --> 02:10:28.902]  And it seems like the Japanese government's paralyzed.
[02:10:28.902 --> 02:10:33.625]  They keep pulling the rescuers out, the emergency workers out, saying the radiation's too high.
[02:10:33.625 --> 02:10:36.627]  There's neutron beams for three weeks shooting out.
[02:10:36.627 --> 02:10:44.992]  Dr. Busby, it looks like you've been 100% vindicated from your analysis here, and that it's even worse than what you were saying.
[02:10:44.992 --> 02:10:47.334]  But there's a new sheriff in town.
[02:10:47.334 --> 02:10:51.056]  Just like you said, the key is what they already say is safe is too high.
[02:10:51.056 --> 02:10:52.077]  Well, now they're raising it.
[02:10:52.737 --> 02:11:02.605]  Between 25,000 and 100,000 times safe levels as pure Alice in Wonderland brainwashing enters the equation.
[02:11:02.605 --> 02:11:06.769]  Well, yes Alex, it's criminal irresponsibility in my opinion.
[02:11:06.769 --> 02:11:17.598]  And ultimately I think when these people start to die of cancer, I do hope that they can take legal cases against the individuals, the named individuals, who I see day and every single day.
[02:11:18.018 --> 02:11:18.799]  We're good to go.
[02:11:41.992 --> 02:11:42.372]  We're good.
[02:11:58.059 --> 02:12:06.443]  And those are the people, through the international community, who should foot the bill and who should go in there and sort this business out.
[02:12:06.443 --> 02:12:23.651]  And the first thing that they should do is start bringing in clean food to the people in Tokyo and Ibaraki, who are an enormous population, 36 million people in Tokyo, and there's even radioactivity to the south and to the west of Tokyo now, as I see from the studies that we've done.
[02:12:23.651 --> 02:12:24.891]  And in the area, in the 100km area,
[02:12:27.172 --> 02:12:34.655]  Around Fukushima, we have already calculated what the cancer toll will be in the next 10 years.
[02:12:34.655 --> 02:12:39.057]  And it's upwards of 200,000 cancers in that region.
[02:12:39.057 --> 02:12:43.219]  And if you go out to the 200 kilometers and add them all up, it's about 400,000 extra cancers.
[02:12:43.219 --> 02:12:43.919]  Now!
[02:12:43.919 --> 02:12:45.060]  Now!
[02:12:45.060 --> 02:12:49.022]  So, what can I say?
[02:12:49.022 --> 02:12:53.203]  I mean, I don't want to say, hey, I told you so, because it's all too depressing that I was right.
[02:12:56.069 --> 02:13:07.399]  Well, expanding on that, a week and a half ago, India banned any imports of Japanese seafood or produce or any of their other edible products.
[02:13:07.399 --> 02:13:11.363]  But here, the Feds are not releasing radiation levels, they're not testing fish.
[02:13:11.943 --> 02:13:15.506]  They've raised levels saying that's why they don't need to.
[02:13:15.506 --> 02:13:17.167]  And Dr. Bob Bowman was on last hour.
[02:13:17.167 --> 02:13:29.476]  He said people that do eat fish from that area, you know, one fish that's been exposed to the 7.5 million normal levels, that that'll be enough to kill people within a few months to a few years.
[02:13:29.476 --> 02:13:31.918]  Generally, you'll just see overall cancer increases.
[02:13:32.718 --> 02:14:02.378]  Here in the United States that has double the regular radiation in a place like Australia has just from Chernobyl not to mention Western Europe or Eastern Europe and so they're just out of sight out of mind no discussion of Even testing people on flights even though they have tested some previously and found high levels of radiation They just quit doing the testing so it's a policy of just brushing it under the rug and acting like it doesn't exist and just Allowing all this Japanese produce to be dumped into the United States
[02:14:03.619 --> 02:14:07.281]  Well, this is a democratic issue.
[02:14:07.281 --> 02:14:08.361]  I'm a scientist.
[02:14:08.361 --> 02:14:15.485]  All I can do is advise on what I believe to be the consequences of these radiation exposures.
[02:14:15.485 --> 02:14:20.368]  And my advice, which we put up on the website of the Low-Level Radiation Campaign and also
[02:14:21.909 --> 02:14:33.238]  We've been putting our monitoring advice up on there, and our advice to the people is just don't believe the government.
[02:14:33.238 --> 02:14:44.106]  I mean, don't believe the spokespeople of the governments, of the administrations, of the EPA, of in my country the Health Protection Agency, of the Japanese authorities.
[02:14:44.106 --> 02:14:49.710]  All of these people all along have been saying there's no problem, and then when something
[02:14:50.711 --> 02:14:52.212]  Well, the Russians were excoriated!
[02:15:18.527 --> 02:15:18.808]  I think so.
[02:15:28.660 --> 02:15:33.805]  The levels of radioactive contamination on the ground are up to 68 kilometres.
[02:15:33.805 --> 02:15:38.710]  So this is seven times the area of the Chernobyl contamination zone.
[02:15:38.710 --> 02:15:39.971]  Seven times the area.
[02:15:39.971 --> 02:15:44.136]  And they were still allowing people to live there, and they still now allow people to live there.
[02:15:44.136 --> 02:15:49.161]  So the exclusion zone, which has only now been extended to 30 kilometres, is still not adequate.
[02:15:49.161 --> 02:15:51.203]  It needs to be extended to at least 100 kilometres.
[02:15:52.892 --> 02:15:53.653]  We're good to go.
[02:16:12.461 --> 02:16:12.761]  I think so.
[02:16:28.587 --> 02:16:33.229]  But going back to what you said, you're absolutely right about the Russian situation.
[02:16:33.229 --> 02:16:36.690]  The Russians covered it up for a few days but did pull people back.
[02:16:36.690 --> 02:16:39.751]  And then they were excoriated for it and still are.
[02:16:39.751 --> 02:16:43.092]  But then you see the West with Japan and General Electric
[02:16:43.752 --> 02:16:49.194]  Full court press still involved in a cover-up at every level.
[02:16:49.194 --> 02:16:56.658]  It just shows they're intending to keep building new reactors, keep the old ones open, and just continue moving forward with this.
[02:16:56.658 --> 02:17:06.682]  As the fertility drops, can you speak more to the numbers on what we know increased background radiation is doing to countries that have these systems in place?
[02:17:08.164 --> 02:17:25.753]  Well, we know from the research that I've done that the nuclear power stations themselves cause about a doubling of risk of a whole range of cancers and an increased risk, maybe up to 10 times risk, of childhood cancers and leukemias.
[02:17:25.753 --> 02:17:28.575]  But the real problem is from the radiation itself that they
[02:17:28.575 --> 02:17:29.035]  We're good to go.
[02:17:47.503 --> 02:18:02.614]  There's an orgy of superpower testing which generated really large quantities of these novel radionuclides like plutonium-239 and strontium-90 and cesium-137 and all of these things that are coming out of Fukushima, of course.
[02:18:02.614 --> 02:18:06.797]  And this material, together with the depleted uranium that's being produced, that has been
[02:18:06.817 --> 02:18:07.217]  I think so.
[02:18:21.713 --> 02:18:24.255]  I mean, you don't need to go to the cancer registries to find this out.
[02:18:24.255 --> 02:18:30.640]  You only have to walk down any high street to see the number of cancer charity shops that have been generated over this period.
[02:18:30.640 --> 02:18:35.965]  And everybody has people who've died of cancer, who know people, even dogs and cats and budgerigars.
[02:18:35.965 --> 02:18:37.025]  They've all died of cancer.
[02:18:37.025 --> 02:18:39.007]  This is an absolute cancer epidemic.
[02:18:39.007 --> 02:18:44.471]  This is caused by the increase in the quantity of these novel radioactive substances into the environment.
[02:18:47.091 --> 02:18:48.295]  I think so.
[02:19:01.564 --> 02:19:02.725]  You can have three parents!
[02:19:19.518 --> 02:19:30.421]  So if this goes on, and it does seem to be getting a lot worse now with Fukushima, because this is going to flood the globe with more radionuclides, it's going to be a case of actually having no more people.
[02:19:30.421 --> 02:19:38.824]  There's going to be so much infertility in human beings, but also in other species too, that life on the planet itself will be threatened.
[02:19:38.824 --> 02:19:40.064]  Stay there!
[02:19:40.064 --> 02:19:44.526]  There have been measurements made in the Middle East, in Jerusalem, a few years ago.
[02:19:46.397 --> 02:19:47.338]  Dr. Busby, stay there.
[02:19:47.338 --> 02:19:48.539]  We're going to come right back to you.
[02:19:48.539 --> 02:19:53.845]  I want to get to that area on the measurements in Jerusalem.
[02:19:53.845 --> 02:19:54.586]  And then we'll also...
[02:19:56.124 --> 02:20:01.225]  Discuss the fact that they're setting the precedent to just raise the background radiation level and say it's healthy.
[02:20:01.225 --> 02:20:02.526]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:20:02.526 --> 02:20:08.107]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:20:08.107 --> 02:20:13.129]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:20:13.129 --> 02:20:13.609]  It's true.
[02:20:13.609 --> 02:20:16.409]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[02:20:16.409 --> 02:20:18.150]  And it's possible that could even happen again.
[02:20:18.690 --> 02:20:23.914]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:20:23.914 --> 02:20:26.235]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[02:20:26.235 --> 02:20:31.038]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:20:31.038 --> 02:20:32.159]  And here's the best part.
[02:20:32.159 --> 02:20:35.221]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:20:35.221 --> 02:20:38.844]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:20:38.844 --> 02:20:42.046]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:20:42.046 --> 02:20:44.267]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:20:44.267 --> 02:20:45.188]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:20:48.830 --> 02:20:53.055]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:20:53.055 --> 02:20:57.900]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:20:57.900 --> 02:21:00.283]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:21:03.536 --> 02:21:05.878]  Alex Jones here with key information.
[02:21:05.878 --> 02:21:06.438]  The U.S.
[02:21:06.438 --> 02:21:13.723]  government is a Ponzi scheme that relies on the Treasury continuously selling large amounts of government bonds to foreign central banks.
[02:21:13.723 --> 02:21:16.425]  With Japan about to become a seller of U.S.
[02:21:16.425 --> 02:21:19.768]  bonds in order to rebuild its own nation, and the U.S.
[02:21:19.768 --> 02:21:26.433]  antagonizing China by calling them currency manipulators, the Federal Reserve, which is already buying about 70% of U.S.
[02:21:26.433 --> 02:21:29.075]  Treasuries, will soon be the only buyer left of U.S.
[02:21:29.075 --> 02:21:29.515]  Treasuries.
[02:21:29.915 --> 02:21:33.437]  Our friends at the National Inflation Association believe that the U.S.
[02:21:33.437 --> 02:21:39.381]  dollar will soon become worthless and Americans will see the purchasing power of their incomes and savings destroyed.
[02:21:39.381 --> 02:21:47.845]  I strongly urge my fellow Americans to sign up for the free NIA newsletter at www.inflation.us.
[02:21:47.845 --> 02:21:57.191]  If you are sick and tired of the economic propaganda in the mainstream media, sign up for free at inflation.us to learn the economic truth that the mainstream media ignores.
[02:22:00.066 --> 02:22:02.987]  Going solar for cheap is as easy as 123.
[02:22:02.987 --> 02:22:09.109]  If you want to go solar but thought the setup costs were too high, now you can build your own solar panels for less than $200.
[02:22:09.109 --> 02:22:09.870]  Don't laugh!
[02:22:09.870 --> 02:22:12.811]  We've sold over 45,000 solar do-it-yourself kits.

[02:22:29.697 --> 02:22:30.939]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:30.939 --> 02:22:35.485]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:22:35.485 --> 02:22:41.313]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:22:41.313 --> 02:22:44.698]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:22:44.938 --> 02:22:47.579]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:47.579 --> 02:22:52.721]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[02:22:52.721 --> 02:22:55.562]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:55.562 --> 02:22:57.343]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:57.343 --> 02:23:01.544]  Do you suffer from adrenal fatigue?
[02:23:01.544 --> 02:23:08.267]  Did you know that mercury from your dental fillings can deposit into your kidneys and adrenals and cause them to lose up to 60% of their functional capacity?
[02:23:08.587 --> 02:23:12.212]  I've had first-hand experience with the damage mercury can do to the body.
[02:23:12.212 --> 02:23:17.658]  I've made it a life's work to figure out what went wrong after I got two large mercury fillings put into my teeth.
[02:23:17.658 --> 02:23:21.123]  I also know the most effective means by which the body can remove mercury.
[02:23:21.123 --> 02:23:25.909]  It has to do in large part with how well your liver functions and how much glutathione your cells produce.
[02:23:26.289 --> 02:23:32.675]  The number one superfood that supports optimal levels of glutathione is cold processed whey protein from grass-fed cows.
[02:23:32.675 --> 02:23:36.278]  One World Whey is unheated whey protein from grass-fed cows.
[02:23:36.278 --> 02:23:40.241]  It is the most bioactive, undenatured whey protein on the market.
[02:23:40.241 --> 02:23:46.367]  People are reporting health improvements from this one product that I've not seen in 20 years of clinical nutritional practice.
[02:23:46.767 --> 02:23:47.268]  Call 888-988-3325.
[02:23:47.268 --> 02:23:47.468]  That's 888-988-3325.
[02:23:47.468 --> 02:23:48.509]  Or visit OneWorldWay.com.
[02:23:48.509 --> 02:23:49.330]  That's OneWorld, W-H-E-Y.com.
[02:24:13.473 --> 02:24:19.039]  Chemical physicist, nuclear radiation poisoning expert, Dr. Christopher Busby is our guest.
[02:24:23.246 --> 02:24:47.107]  You were getting into radiation levels rising in and around the Holy Land, but then I wanted, in the brief time we have left with you, correct me if I'm wrong, but the system is openly just saying, look, we're just going to raise normal background levels and just get you to accept that radiation is good for you, and the Japanese ought to be thankful, and just like until 1991, they wouldn't let the troops use DU.
[02:24:48.468 --> 02:24:58.662]  After that, they waved a magic wand, said, ignore all the old army reports saying it'll kill troops, you know, with a soft kill in a few decades if they use this weapon, maybe even quicker.
[02:24:58.662 --> 02:25:00.284]  And now they just say, go ahead and use it.
[02:25:00.284 --> 02:25:02.908]  So the attitude is, just go all the way.
[02:25:04.394 --> 02:25:19.147]  Well, radiation is not good for you and the risk agencies, all of the international risk agencies will state in their documents that the smallest dose of radiation can cause damage and that damage can lead to cancer.
[02:25:19.807 --> 02:25:20.028]  I think so.
[02:25:35.191 --> 02:25:53.665]  I mean, in what way do you have any mandate from the people, from the public, whose taxes pay you to protect them, to just arbitrarily change the baseline when you decide that it's useful to the nuclear industry to do that?
[02:25:53.665 --> 02:25:56.227]  It's totally unacceptable.
[02:25:56.227 --> 02:25:57.007]  It's quite wrong.
[02:25:57.007 --> 02:25:58.969]  It's, in fact, criminally wrong, in my opinion.
[02:25:59.960 --> 02:26:05.506]  Yes sir, you were, before you got interrupted by the break, you were getting into increased radiation levels in Israel?
[02:26:05.506 --> 02:26:14.116]  Well, I was saying that following the increase in the concentration of uranium from the uranium weapons usage in 1991,
[02:26:15.878 --> 02:26:38.773]  The whole of that area has become contaminated with uranium particles and there was a study done a couple of years ago of sperm counts in young men in Jerusalem and I think that the figure was that there was a 40% reduction in the last 10 years in the sperm count, the viable sperm count in young men who were studied in this Jerusalem hospital.
[02:26:44.844 --> 02:26:44.944]  No.
[02:27:06.767 --> 02:27:11.851]  Looking at this, obviously this is a disaster for the nuclear industry.
[02:27:11.851 --> 02:27:18.617]  That's why they're trying the psychological tactic of just throwing it in everybody's face right now.
[02:27:18.617 --> 02:27:25.022]  Do you think that's going to be successful with their psychological judo of saying, everyone should be thankful, this is good?
[02:27:25.520 --> 02:27:34.267]  Well I have to say that we have had massive support for the various programs where I've managed to get into the media to argue all of these things that I've been arguing.
[02:27:34.267 --> 02:27:43.935]  Basically arguing that the dose risk idea that they have, the risk model that they have is totally incorrect for internal radionuclides.
[02:27:46.997 --> 02:27:48.578]  I think the people are not fooled anymore.
[02:27:48.578 --> 02:27:49.278]  I have to say that.
[02:27:49.278 --> 02:27:58.522]  I think probably because of the internet and because of people like you, people who can get the truth out onto the internet and through independent channels of communication.
[02:27:58.522 --> 02:28:01.563]  I think that the people are no longer, the public are no longer fooled anyway.
[02:28:01.563 --> 02:28:03.304]  I sincerely hope that that's the case.
[02:28:03.304 --> 02:28:05.905]  And they are voting at their feet too.
[02:28:05.905 --> 02:28:12.448]  They aren't drinking the water and they aren't drinking the milk and so they're not really taking the advice that is given to them by the authorities.
[02:28:13.470 --> 02:28:17.539]  And now it's all over the Japanese news that the people are becoming enraged.
[02:28:17.539 --> 02:28:19.845]  They know they've been lied to, so even the...
[02:28:21.636 --> 02:28:27.958]  The very polite Japanese, slow to anger, are coming out and saying, we know this is a fraud.
[02:28:27.958 --> 02:28:39.501]  I've seen the reports now for two weeks, though, that Japanese doctors are so concerned about radiation that they're refusing to even treat, in some areas, people with radiation poisoning because they don't want to come in contact with them.
[02:28:39.501 --> 02:28:44.822]  I mean, that's terrible on the surface, but that'll give you an idea of just how serious this is.
[02:28:45.717 --> 02:28:50.622]  Yes, it is very serious, and it may even be more serious than is being suggested now.
[02:28:50.622 --> 02:28:59.490]  Last time I spoke with you I said I thought that this was a singularly Japanese problem, but I think that these reactors are still fissioning.
[02:28:59.490 --> 02:29:08.959]  We know from the isotope ratios that are being measured, some of the isotopes that are being measured are very short-life isotopes which only occur after fission, and so we know that these
[02:29:15.077 --> 02:29:15.558]  I don't think so.
[02:29:31.881 --> 02:29:35.143]  Dr. Busby, do five more minutes with us, then we're going to go to everybody's calls.
[02:29:35.143 --> 02:29:46.469]  I want you to be able to finish up with the fact that we have these boiling, burning, exploding cauldrons, and now the Japanese government under the radar says, this could go on for months, this could go on for years.
[02:29:46.469 --> 02:29:51.332]  We'll be right back and look at the different scenarios that could unfold.
[02:29:51.332 --> 02:29:55.254]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.254 --> 02:29:57.936]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.067 --> 02:30:02.708]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.

[02:31:01.969 --> 02:31:05.973]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:31:05.973 --> 02:31:09.237]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:31:09.237 --> 02:31:14.042]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:31:14.042 --> 02:31:20.428]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:31:20.428 --> 02:31:22.671]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:31:23.171 --> 02:31:23.491]  Tim Geithner?
[02:31:23.491 --> 02:31:24.012]  Bernanke?
[02:31:24.012 --> 02:31:24.812]  They're arsonists!
[02:31:24.812 --> 02:31:25.773]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:31:25.773 --> 02:31:28.214]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:31:42.102 --> 02:31:49.370]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[02:32:00.896 --> 02:32:07.842]  Over the last year, Alex has told you about, and many of you have experienced, emergencies and disasters in unprecedented numbers.
[02:32:07.842 --> 02:32:10.484]  People have had to literally run for their lives.
[02:32:10.484 --> 02:32:12.926]  Folks, this is Steve Schenck with Ifoots Direct.
[02:32:12.926 --> 02:32:17.310]  I'm not here to scare you, but when disaster strikes, you won't have time to think.
[02:32:17.310 --> 02:32:19.011]  You must act automatically.
[02:32:19.011 --> 02:32:22.514]  What does a pilot do when the helicopter engine fails in flight?
[02:32:22.514 --> 02:32:23.575]  No time to think.
[02:32:23.575 --> 02:32:24.956]  Just act automatically.
[02:32:25.276 --> 02:32:33.621]  When the alert is broadcast, the alarm sounds, or the knock comes on your door, you'll need to be ready to act without thinking of what to do or what you need.
[02:32:33.621 --> 02:32:36.663]  You need a 5-Day Extreme Emergency Kit.
[02:32:36.663 --> 02:32:42.307]  With serious supplies and real food to secure 2 adults for 5 days, this powerful $300 Extreme Emergency Kit is free.
[02:32:44.828 --> 02:32:45.648]  No one's gonna take me alive
[02:33:15.860 --> 02:33:21.962]  Dr. Christopher Busby, radiation specialist, chemical physicist, is our guest for a few more minutes.
[02:33:21.962 --> 02:33:25.483]  I'm going to your phone calls and other important news today.
[02:33:25.483 --> 02:33:32.106]  But when we went to the break, you were getting into the fact that this is ongoing.
[02:33:32.106 --> 02:33:37.468]  And it's so bad, the radiation is so high, they've pulled out the emergency workers yet again.
[02:33:38.608 --> 02:33:49.776]  And they're talking about people getting, in just five hours working there, enough of a dose that the head of the plant said it would roughly kill half the people that come in contact with it.
[02:33:49.776 --> 02:33:52.018]  We're not seeing a lot of reports about radiation sickness.
[02:33:52.018 --> 02:33:54.779]  We see some going back two weeks ago in the hospitals.
[02:33:54.779 --> 02:33:58.502]  So it looks like that's being underplayed there.
[02:33:58.502 --> 02:34:03.786]  We see our media here in the United States saying, hey, don't worry, the government's just raising the safe level.
[02:34:07.228 --> 02:34:14.452]  I want you to speak about the different scenarios that can now unfold at these six reactors, including two of them, they successfully shut down.
[02:34:14.452 --> 02:34:17.574]  Number five has still had problems and partial meltdown.
[02:34:17.574 --> 02:34:19.515]  I want to talk about that in closing.
[02:34:19.515 --> 02:34:29.480]  But I also want to go back to you mentioned an event in Russia in the early 50s, where a facility holding rods actually blew up.
[02:34:29.480 --> 02:34:31.702]  And I want to talk about what type of explosion that was.
[02:34:31.702 --> 02:34:32.262]  Please continue.
[02:34:33.041 --> 02:34:33.982]  Yes, OK.
[02:34:33.982 --> 02:34:42.669]  Well, as far as the future is concerned, we are really in science fiction territory, so I don't want to make too many predictions about this.
[02:34:42.669 --> 02:34:54.819]  What you have is you have reactors that normally would be reacting inside a metal container where everything was kept inside and all the radionuclides were inside it, but these are now reacting outside.
[02:34:55.439 --> 02:34:55.820]  We're good to go.
[02:35:10.196 --> 02:35:10.916]  We're good to go.
[02:35:35.166 --> 02:35:39.169]  So you've got this stuff out of the box, that's the problem there, and something has to be done about it.
[02:35:39.169 --> 02:35:55.578]  Now I have to tell you that this is some confidential information that came to me, I can't say who from, but they're so concerned about it, the authorities, that they've developed an argument between the United States advisers and the French advisers over what to do.
[02:35:55.578 --> 02:36:00.421]  And the United States advisers wanted to bomb these reactors into the sea, and the French
[02:36:01.001 --> 02:36:01.502]  I think so.
[02:36:08.697 --> 02:36:09.537]  We're good to go.
[02:36:34.663 --> 02:36:38.364]  I mean, who can possibly figure out what the best way to do this is?
[02:36:38.364 --> 02:36:42.125]  We have a global catastrophe on our hands here.
[02:36:42.125 --> 02:36:44.225]  As I said, it was potentially a global catastrophe.
[02:36:44.225 --> 02:36:48.406]  Now we go to Kyshtym.
[02:36:48.406 --> 02:36:55.528]  In 1959, I think it was, there was an explosion in Kyshtym in the Mayak facility at Chelyabinsk.
[02:36:55.528 --> 02:37:00.849]  And that was an explosion related to fuel rods, which melted down.
[02:37:01.465 --> 02:37:02.606]  We're good to go.
[02:37:31.911 --> 02:37:46.345]  That was my next point is that I've read I've read some physicists say that if they are able to separate out the plutonium the uranium and then other isotopes that you can get some type of actual chain reaction that I've had other physicists on who say that they don't think
[02:37:46.966 --> 02:37:56.289]  That that was possible, but the same physicist said he didn't think 5 or 6 could have a meltdown because they'd been shut down before the event, and 5 has now.
[02:37:56.289 --> 02:38:11.254]  I don't think anybody knows quite what happens at these temperatures under these conditions, and there are all sorts of parameters that have never been involved before, like seawater, like sodium chloride, like molten salts, all sorts of things that would never have been experimented on.
[02:38:11.254 --> 02:38:16.336]  So in principle, it might be possible for plutonium to separate from the general mix,
[02:38:20.285 --> 02:38:20.946]  Okay, final question.
[02:38:20.946 --> 02:38:21.827]  We're gonna let you go, Dr. Busby.
[02:38:21.827 --> 02:38:23.068]  We appreciate the time.
[02:38:42.412 --> 02:38:52.982]  Looking at this situation at Fukushima, I know you don't like to look into the future, but they've said it could go on for months or longer.
[02:38:52.982 --> 02:38:59.268]  I mean, from researching this, from seeing other cases, how long do you think it could go on?
[02:38:59.268 --> 02:39:02.831]  A, and then B, we see reports
[02:39:03.952 --> 02:39:06.653]  of governments in the U.N.
[02:39:06.653 --> 02:39:11.715]  saying that Chernobyl in 86 was 400 times a Hiroshima.
[02:39:11.715 --> 02:39:18.698]  Why are reactor meltdowns so much more dirty than an atomic or hydrogen explosion?
[02:39:18.698 --> 02:39:19.759]  Or is that wrong?
[02:39:19.759 --> 02:39:20.519]  Yeah, no, that's right.
[02:39:20.519 --> 02:39:21.319]  They are more dirty.
[02:39:21.319 --> 02:39:24.861]  And the reason they're more dirty is because they have lost amounts of uranium.
[02:39:24.861 --> 02:39:28.682]  I mean, the atomic bomb at Hiroshima was a limited amount of uranium.
[02:39:28.682 --> 02:39:32.664]  I don't know, kilograms, maybe a ton total.
[02:39:35.959 --> 02:39:43.801]  I mean, the number of spent fuel rods there, as I understood it, was about 1,700 tons of spent fuel.
[02:39:43.801 --> 02:39:51.102]  And each of these reactors probably contains about 100 to 150 tons of uranium and plutonium and mixed radionuclides.
[02:39:51.102 --> 02:39:52.522]  So there's just a lot more stuff.
[02:39:52.522 --> 02:39:53.843]  That's basically it.
[02:39:53.843 --> 02:39:59.284]  The Chernobyl accident, which I think actually now, having talked to some Russians last week
[02:39:59.804 --> 02:40:00.444]  I think so.
[02:40:24.295 --> 02:40:31.267]  So, clearly from the Russian example, some type of chain reaction is theoretically possible.
[02:40:31.267 --> 02:40:33.811]  Again, I'm... That is right.
[02:40:33.811 --> 02:40:35.153]  The Russian explosion...
[02:40:39.991 --> 02:40:40.772]  We're good to go.
[02:40:55.242 --> 02:40:55.902]  I don't know.
[02:41:11.651 --> 02:41:15.095]  Whoa, whoa, I said last question, but this is bombshell.
[02:41:15.095 --> 02:41:29.370]  You're out there, you're on major boards in Europe, you're talking to top nuclear engineers, and not only does it look like there was a nuclear explosion at this 50s event in Russia, they're saying Chernobyl was really some type of atomic chain reaction.
[02:41:29.370 --> 02:41:31.012]  Correct, absolutely so.
[02:41:31.012 --> 02:41:33.114]  The definition is based on the measurement
[02:41:33.234 --> 02:41:33.975]  We're good to go.
[02:41:49.574 --> 02:41:54.675]  Dr. Busby, can I ask you a favor, or a favor for humanity?
[02:41:54.675 --> 02:42:09.699]  I want to have Kurt Nemo, one of my writers, right now, we'll call him up here, and call you back at home or your office, or can you send to an email we'll give you, maybe a two-paragraph write-up, to make sure we get the isotopes correct?
[02:42:09.699 --> 02:42:10.599]  Yeah, sure.
[02:42:10.599 --> 02:42:15.420]  There are xenon-133 and xenon-123M, which is a metastable isotope of xenon.
[02:42:15.720 --> 02:42:21.623]  Sure, it's just my writers, because they're not nuclear physicists or chemical physicists, don't like to do this.
[02:42:21.623 --> 02:42:24.764]  Yeah, what we're gonna do, sir, is...
[02:42:31.467 --> 02:42:38.029]  We're gonna give you our email and if you could just write up in two paragraphs what you just said.
[02:42:38.029 --> 02:42:48.831]  Jaron, will you put Dr. Busby on hold and here in a moment and give him your email and just because on the show insert I'm gonna go write an article with Kurt Nemo.
[02:42:48.831 --> 02:42:51.452]  How fast can you send me just two paragraphs to be put in the story?
[02:42:52.162 --> 02:42:54.584]  Well, I could do it in five minutes, okay?
[02:42:54.584 --> 02:42:55.944]  Okay, well that's very gracious.
[02:42:55.944 --> 02:43:02.649]  Anything else you'd like to add, we'll put it into a story, because you are highly respected, one of the chief advisors to the BBC as well.
[02:43:02.649 --> 02:43:21.140]  Just in closing, because you said something very powerful there, you're saying, and you've been proving completely right in your analysis of the last month and two days, you're saying, sir, that evidence points towards chain reactions, some type of atomic explosion, in and around Fukushima, and that's what you're saying?
[02:43:21.620 --> 02:43:24.262]  No, I'm saying that Chernobyl was a nuclear explosion.
[02:43:24.262 --> 02:43:29.906]  I'm saying that there's no evidence that there was a nuclear explosion at Fukushima, but my belief is that there was, okay?
[02:43:29.906 --> 02:43:31.307]  So we don't have evidence for that.
[02:43:31.307 --> 02:43:33.849]  We would have to have the xenon isotope ratios.
[02:43:33.849 --> 02:43:41.095]  But what I am saying is that all of this talk about hydrogen explosions and Chernobyl being a hydrogen explosion is not true for Chernobyl.
[02:43:41.095 --> 02:43:44.597]  Chernobyl was not a hydrogen explosion, it was a nuclear explosion.
[02:43:44.597 --> 02:43:44.878]  Okay.
[02:43:46.159 --> 02:44:08.931]  I understand that, and what really puts the cherry on top, or the coup de grace of this whole thing, is that they will never release the actual isotope readings we've noticed, and for three weeks they wouldn't release anything for the two prefectures in and around Fukushima, which they now admit they didn't release because they didn't want to scare people, and that adds weight to what you're saying.
[02:44:08.931 --> 02:44:15.694]  If they don't want to release the exact isotope readings, that's because they don't want the fingerprint of atomic chain reaction
[02:44:16.294 --> 02:44:18.216]  Maybe so, but my feeling is not that.
[02:44:18.216 --> 02:44:24.219]  My feeling is that they don't want people to know how much plutonium and uranium they're exploding about because that's the really dangerous stuff.
[02:44:24.219 --> 02:44:30.283]  All this iodine, the focus on iodine is a red herring in a way.
[02:44:30.283 --> 02:44:34.046]  And even on cesium-137, the really seriously dangerous isotopes are
[02:44:34.246 --> 02:44:34.686]  Okay, we'll do this!
[02:44:56.732 --> 02:45:06.439]  Well, because if there's a slight increase in iodine, it could well be that that's associated also with the existence of these airborne particles, and it's the particles that are the problem.
[02:45:06.439 --> 02:45:16.526]  To say nothing of the tritium, we haven't heard about the isotope tritium, which will be produced in massive, massive, massive amounts as tritiated water, which is sort of radioactive water.
[02:45:16.526 --> 02:45:20.229]  I would like to know very much what the tritium level is in the tap water in Tokyo.
[02:45:22.583 --> 02:45:24.324]  Well, they have reported some tritium levels.
[02:45:24.324 --> 02:45:25.424]  I've seen that in the press.
[02:45:25.424 --> 02:45:39.850]  Now, expanding on this, and we're going to let you go, just perhaps so we have a grasp of the history, a paragraph on the Russian incident, a paragraph on your meeting with a Russian scientist on Chernobyl, believing that that was some type of atomic explosion, and then your statement on that.
[02:45:39.850 --> 02:45:41.550]  So we could have those three paragraphs from you.
[02:45:41.550 --> 02:45:43.431]  Anything else you'd like to add?
[02:45:43.431 --> 02:45:46.072]  We really appreciate your gracious time.
[02:45:46.072 --> 02:45:48.653]  And what is the best website for us to learn more, Dr. Busby?
[02:45:49.765 --> 02:45:55.406]  We're putting all our stuff on the website of the low-level radiation campaign, llrc.org.
[02:45:55.406 --> 02:46:07.469]  But in terms of the risk model, you need to go to the European Committee on Radiation Risk website, where we have now, because of the Fukushima accident, we have now released the 2010 report as a free download, so anybody can have it.
[02:46:07.469 --> 02:46:08.489]  That cost £70 to buy that report.
[02:46:13.350 --> 02:46:19.116]  Because of the extraordinary developments in Fukushima, we feel that everybody should have access to that report.
[02:46:19.116 --> 02:46:25.803]  So it's a free download from the Euradcom, E-U-R-A-D-C-O-M dot org.
[02:46:25.803 --> 02:46:26.964]  You can get it from there.
[02:46:26.964 --> 02:46:32.089]  And this is the risk model that will tell you how many people are going to die after any sort of exposure.
[02:46:33.035 --> 02:46:53.680]  Yeah, well my dad separately took physics at UT where they have a reactor when he was in college and he said they taught then that they believed a meltdown could properly separate out like you said and then I don't want to butcher what he said but then some type of ion beam or almost electrical charge could go through it and that that could create the chain reaction.
[02:46:53.680 --> 02:46:55.421]  Am I butchering what he said?
[02:46:56.141 --> 02:46:56.541]  I don't know.
[02:46:56.541 --> 02:46:57.462]  I didn't hear what he said.
[02:46:57.462 --> 02:47:06.368]  But the point is that if you have enough plutonium together in one place, the neutron flux gets high enough for it to achieve a prompt criticality.
[02:47:06.368 --> 02:47:10.271]  So the question is whether or not the plutonium can separate from the uranium.
[02:47:10.271 --> 02:47:15.474]  Plutonium oxide can separate from the uranium oxide at these extremely high temperatures that there are.
[02:47:15.474 --> 02:47:18.356]  And I don't think enough is known to be able to say that
[02:47:19.639 --> 02:47:20.280]  All right, amazing.
[02:47:20.280 --> 02:47:23.883]  We're going to put you on hold and give you that internal email.
[02:47:23.883 --> 02:47:31.610]  Make sure we've got your email and we're waiting the next 20 minutes or so to get that key email so we can add that to an article we're going to do.
[02:47:31.610 --> 02:47:33.111]  Dr. Christopher Busby, thank you for joining us.
[02:47:33.111 --> 02:47:34.552]  Okay.
[02:47:34.552 --> 02:47:38.696]  All right, amazing information there, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:47:38.696 --> 02:47:41.659]  So that would basically
[02:47:45.171 --> 02:47:47.572]  Really changed the whole paradigm of what we're looking at here.
[02:47:47.572 --> 02:47:59.415]  And I went online and read other physicists saying that there could be some type of atomic reaction, nuclear explosion, with these reactors.
[02:47:59.415 --> 02:48:05.476]  And then I talked to a lot of other people and did some more research, and they say that it is in the realm of possibility.
[02:48:05.476 --> 02:48:09.918]  But regardless, you've got the equivalent of dirty bombs going off every day, just pumping this into the atmosphere.
[02:48:09.918 --> 02:48:11.318]  We'll take calls for the rest of this segment.
[02:48:12.532 --> 02:48:13.092]  and the next.
[02:48:13.092 --> 02:48:18.414]  I didn't mean to keep Dr. Busby that long, but that information was just too powerful.
[02:48:18.414 --> 02:48:21.094]  Let's go ahead and talk to Daniel in New Jersey.
[02:48:21.094 --> 02:48:22.234]  Daniel, you're on the air.
[02:48:22.234 --> 02:48:22.555]  Welcome.
[02:48:22.555 --> 02:48:24.235]  Thanks for holding.
[02:48:24.235 --> 02:48:25.095]  Hi, Alex.
[02:48:25.095 --> 02:48:26.736]  I just have two questions.
[02:48:26.736 --> 02:48:40.199]  I graduated high school last year, and I came across your show while traveling in my gap year for college, and I used to live a really, like, sheltered life full of the typical middle-class American lives, but now, you know, I feel like things you're showing a lot of
[02:48:40.697 --> 02:48:42.179]  Books and documentaries that I've read.
[02:48:42.179 --> 02:48:47.205]  I think I have a really good grip on the real world I live in.
[02:48:47.205 --> 02:48:58.539]  All I really have of value to my name is a job and time and my question to you is how not just me but other young adults my age invest our time and resources with the
[02:48:59.565 --> 02:49:00.906]  Intending troubles to come.
[02:49:00.906 --> 02:49:04.529]  Well, I wouldn't wait till you perfect your message or your information.
[02:49:04.529 --> 02:49:16.037]  I would go, it might be a town 50 miles away, it might be the town you're in, but I would go and take the little classes and pay the fee or whatever and do a live access TV show or a tape TV show.
[02:49:16.037 --> 02:49:22.202]  Whether you reach a hundred people in a small town or ten thousand in a city like Austin on average with an access show.
[02:49:22.202 --> 02:49:23.923]  I would air films on access.
[02:49:23.923 --> 02:49:24.844]  I would start a blog.
[02:49:25.884 --> 02:49:27.885]  Start shooting your own YouTube videos.
[02:49:27.885 --> 02:49:30.467]  That's free, just the webcam.
[02:49:30.467 --> 02:49:37.110]  And I would have your voice heard and reach out to other people and start a local organization for liberty, Sons and Daughters of Liberty.
[02:49:37.110 --> 02:49:42.413]  And I would get together with like-minded people and start speaking at city council against fluoridation.
[02:49:42.413 --> 02:49:45.814]  The journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step.
[02:49:45.814 --> 02:49:50.757]  We need more leaders and more educators to rise up in the system
[02:49:51.457 --> 02:49:55.681]  Because we are the majority, we have right on our side, we have history on our side.
[02:49:55.681 --> 02:50:09.814]  And so I would start with a blog, I'd start with a radio blog, I'd start with a YouTube channel, and just get up there and turn the camera on, or if you don't want your face on TV, on the web, just put an image up, you know, a map of the world or whatever, and just talk.
[02:50:09.814 --> 02:50:13.257]  And then put out your email and say, I want to organize with other local people.
[02:50:13.257 --> 02:50:17.380]  Because the globalists can't deal with a mass of awakened people taking action.
[02:50:18.083 --> 02:50:23.129]  You don't have to save the world by yourself, it's that resistance that causes victory.
[02:50:23.129 --> 02:50:24.131]  Right.
[02:50:24.131 --> 02:50:35.085]  Okay, and also my second question is that the Obama administration is supposed to be giving reform legislation for No Child Left Behind, and I did some research on Arne Duncan, who's
[02:50:35.703 --> 02:50:43.705]  Yeah, Secretary of Education, and before that he was the CEO of the Chicago Public Schools, and you know, we all know how that's going right now.
[02:50:43.705 --> 02:50:44.385]  It's going well!
[02:50:44.385 --> 02:50:51.187]  They're really dumbing people down, and they're not allowed to have their parents make them lunch, but that's what you expect in a prison system.
[02:50:51.187 --> 02:50:53.148]  Was that your question or your statement?
[02:50:53.148 --> 02:50:59.790]  Well, that was my statement, just because since Arne Duncan's Secretary of Education, how would you start going about... All right, stay there.
[02:50:59.790 --> 02:51:00.630]  We'll be right back.
[02:51:03.177 --> 02:51:05.258]  Are you still a traditional smoker?
[02:51:05.258 --> 02:51:10.402]  Now experience a new lifestyle and try vaping with e-cigarettes by Lecig.
[02:51:10.402 --> 02:51:14.264]  Imagine no ashes, stains, nasty smell, or coughing and hacking.

[02:51:45.966 --> 02:51:46.146]  That's 870-518-4307.
[02:51:59.336 --> 02:52:02.339]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:52:02.339 --> 02:52:17.911]  The earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear disaster that killed thousands of Japanese citizens is nothing compared to the devastation that could be caused by hyperinflation that will soon hit the United States and could lead to millions of Americans becoming homeless, all caused by the devalued U.S.
[02:52:17.911 --> 02:52:18.251]  dollar.
[02:52:18.251 --> 02:52:20.793]  While the mainstream media continues to ignore inflation,
[02:52:21.033 --> 02:52:27.938]  Our friends at the National Inflation Association provide a free weekly newsletter that educates Americans of the facts and truth about the U.S.
[02:52:27.938 --> 02:52:29.139]  economy and inflation.
[02:52:29.139 --> 02:52:39.227]  I urge you to sign up at the NIA's free newsletter at www.inflation.us to learn how you can not only survive, but prosper during the upcoming hyperinflation crisis.
[02:52:39.227 --> 02:52:45.312]  Silver has more than doubled since the NIA declared silver the best investment for the next decade on inflation.us.
[02:52:45.612 --> 02:52:55.096]  The NIA's team of expert economists are happy to answer any economic questions you have about inflation, debt, currencies, real estate, precious metals, and commodities.
[02:52:55.096 --> 02:53:00.357]  Visit inflation.us to learn the economic truth that the mainstream media ignores.
[02:53:00.357 --> 02:53:06.820]  This message starts with a great offer from Big Berkey Water Filters because we don't want you drinking dangerous water one minute longer.

[02:54:26.305 --> 02:54:27.626]  Yeah, to the last caller.
[02:54:27.626 --> 02:54:33.970]  I mean, the entire Chicago mafia is replacing a lot of the other DC mob because they're so vicious, so evil.
[02:54:33.970 --> 02:54:35.351]  They know how to get guns.
[02:54:35.351 --> 02:54:36.992]  They know how to dumb kids down.
[02:54:36.992 --> 02:54:39.293]  They know how to shake down business owners.
[02:54:39.293 --> 02:54:42.035]  They are Don Carleone.
[02:54:42.035 --> 02:54:44.136]  And it's just it's just a total takeover.
[02:54:44.136 --> 02:54:45.497]  I mean, you know, in Chicago, it's like
[02:54:45.737 --> 02:54:50.798]  Yeah, your parents not gonna be able to bring, not have your kids a lunch.
[02:54:50.798 --> 02:54:56.119]  We run your kids, they're slaves to us, and you don't pack a lunch for your kids!
[02:54:56.119 --> 02:54:59.100]  You buy the lunch from Don Corleone!
[02:54:59.100 --> 02:55:02.021]  You buy it from Mayor Daley!
[02:55:02.021 --> 02:55:03.941]  You understand me, prisoner?
[02:55:03.941 --> 02:55:05.961]  You work for us, you live for us.
[02:55:05.961 --> 02:55:07.062]  You understand that.
[02:55:07.062 --> 02:55:08.522]  And now we're gonna run the whole country.
[02:55:09.369 --> 02:55:11.593]  Lou Anne, you're on the air from Illinois.
[02:55:11.593 --> 02:55:12.654]  Welcome.
[02:55:12.654 --> 02:55:14.417]  Yes, hello.
[02:55:14.417 --> 02:55:21.148]  I just want to say that I live in Chicago and my daughter was in the Chicago public school system back in the 1980s.
[02:55:22.703 --> 02:55:29.307]  And the same thing that you are talking about today, they were doing back in the 1980s.
[02:55:29.307 --> 02:55:33.129]  The only difference I see is that they have come public with it now.
[02:55:33.129 --> 02:55:38.752]  They are actually telling the citizens what they are doing.
[02:55:38.752 --> 02:55:41.174]  Back in the 80s, it was a total cover-up.
[02:55:44.095 --> 02:55:46.896]  By the way, ma'am, I hate to interrupt you.
[02:55:46.896 --> 02:55:49.698]  You mean not letting you pack a lunch for your child?
[02:55:49.698 --> 02:55:57.001]  The head spokesperson for the Chicago school system said other schools are doing it, but we're not going to tell you which ones.
[02:55:57.001 --> 02:55:58.842]  That's in the Chicago Tribune yesterday.
[02:55:58.842 --> 02:56:00.022]  You're absolutely right.
[02:56:00.022 --> 02:56:04.044]  Even now they're saying, listen up, Mac, you think we're going to tell you what we're doing?
[02:56:04.044 --> 02:56:05.645]  Your kid belongs to us.
[02:56:05.645 --> 02:56:06.625]  Now pay the money!
[02:56:06.625 --> 02:56:07.346]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:56:08.166 --> 02:56:14.434]  Yes, that is what they told me back in the 80s when my daughter was a student in the Chicago Public System.
[02:56:14.434 --> 02:56:20.042]  They told me, to my face, they said, they said, your daughter does not belong to you, she belongs to us.
[02:56:21.059 --> 02:56:26.223]  And they took my child away from me.
[02:56:26.223 --> 02:56:29.945]  And they did that very clandestine.
[02:56:29.945 --> 02:56:35.409]  They went behind my back secretly and took my custody away.
[02:56:35.409 --> 02:56:36.589]  And I didn't even realize.
[02:56:36.589 --> 02:56:41.332]  And then they tell the children, then they tell the children, mommy doesn't want you anymore.
[02:56:41.332 --> 02:56:43.714]  You talk to these kids and then you learn it.
[02:56:43.714 --> 02:56:48.357]  They grab your kids and say, your mommy doesn't want you anymore to make the child not like you.
[02:56:48.357 --> 02:56:49.358]  Did they do that to your daughter?
[02:56:49.918 --> 02:56:50.519]  Oh, yes.
[02:56:50.519 --> 02:56:51.160]  Oh, yes, sir.
[02:56:51.160 --> 02:56:52.061]  They did that.
[02:56:52.061 --> 02:56:52.822]  They did all of that.
[02:56:52.822 --> 02:56:53.703]  Pure evil.
[02:56:53.703 --> 02:56:54.484]  Pure scum.
[02:56:54.484 --> 02:56:55.064]  Pure evil.
[02:56:55.064 --> 02:56:55.745]  Pure.
[02:56:55.745 --> 02:56:59.870]  Yeah, and I tried to explain it to my family, and my family turned against me.
[02:56:59.870 --> 02:57:01.052]  It was a horrible, horrible experience.
[02:57:01.052 --> 02:57:03.995]  Because no one wants to stand up to the government.
[02:57:03.995 --> 02:57:05.037]  No, they don't.
[02:57:05.037 --> 02:57:09.382]  It's like, I mean, look, if they ordered Americans to put their kids in meat grinders, a lot of them would do it.
[02:57:11.420 --> 02:57:12.980]  Yes, yes.
[02:57:12.980 --> 02:57:14.641]  So I experienced all of that.
[02:57:14.641 --> 02:57:21.484]  So I just want the audience to know that these things are real and that Alex is telling the truth.
[02:57:21.484 --> 02:57:25.326]  Well, did you ever get back with your daughter after she grew up and got out of their system?
[02:57:25.666 --> 02:57:31.070]  Yes, it has been very, very difficult, a very hard struggle, but we're back on track now.
[02:57:31.070 --> 02:57:33.772]  We're getting to be back to normal mom and daughter.
[02:57:55.486 --> 02:57:57.167]  Do you hear what I'm saying, Lou Anne?
[02:57:57.167 --> 02:57:58.008]  Oh, yes.
[02:57:58.008 --> 02:57:58.548]  You're right.
[02:57:58.548 --> 02:57:59.328]  You're right, Alex.
[02:57:59.328 --> 02:58:00.609]  You're absolutely right.
[02:58:00.609 --> 02:58:01.390]  God bless you, man.
[02:58:01.390 --> 02:58:07.233]  We've got to hang together or hang separate, and I want to go to Jackie, Chip, and Alan, but I got piles of work to do after the show.
[02:58:07.233 --> 02:58:08.594]  Retransmission's coming up.
[02:58:08.594 --> 02:58:10.816]  We'll be back, Lord willing, tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[02:58:10.816 --> 02:58:11.436]  to 2 p.m.
[02:58:11.436 --> 02:58:12.817]  Central Standard Time.
[02:58:12.817 --> 02:58:13.818]  Life is so short.
[02:58:13.818 --> 02:58:20.302]  Make sure you live it to the fullest, and that means living for liberty, helping other people, but also helping yourself be secure and strong.
[02:58:22.284 --> 02:58:26.807]  Ladies and gentlemen, the people that run the government are a bunch of scum.
[02:58:26.807 --> 02:58:29.089]  Low level, they're just a bunch of idiots.
[02:58:29.089 --> 02:58:33.492]  High up, they're a bunch of manipulating con artist scumbags taking over society.
[02:58:33.492 --> 02:58:35.594]  They think that we're all their slaves.
[02:58:35.594 --> 02:58:37.395]  They think your children are their slaves.
[02:58:37.395 --> 02:58:40.798]  It's time to let these scumbag criminals know we're not your slave scumbag.
