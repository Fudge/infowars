[00:00.000 --> 00:11.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.480 --> 00:19.040]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.040 --> 00:37.120]  Texas Alex Jones we are live it is April 12th 2011 on this live Tuesday
[00:37.120 --> 00:43.400]  edition on screen for prison planet dot TV viewers is the front page of the
[00:43.400 --> 00:49.360]  drudge report yesterday afternoon we posted a new video that surfaced
[00:49.360 --> 00:54.360]  yesterday afternoon that was shot in just the last few days six-year-old girl
[00:54.360 --> 01:00.960]  groped then drug tested by TSA we sent the story to drudge and I'm glad that he
[01:00.960 --> 01:07.520]  linked to the YouTube video six-year-old girl groped then drug tested by TSA
[01:07.520 --> 01:13.320]  we've got the new video plus a large list of other news articles about similar
[01:13.320 --> 01:18.160]  events and other videos and it's a little six-year-old girl and the TSA
[01:18.160 --> 01:24.560]  agent grabs her between the legs sticks her hands in her pants it is horrifying
[01:24.560 --> 01:30.440]  and this morning I was on coast to coast AM last night and this morning when I
[01:30.440 --> 01:35.840]  got up my wife hadn't seen it yet and I sometimes we have slight debates about
[01:35.840 --> 01:39.800]  the fact that I don't want to fly with the children and she concurs but then
[01:39.800 --> 01:43.760]  she says but I still want to travel we never go anywhere and I should hear watch
[01:43.760 --> 01:49.160]  this what would happen if if they tried to do this to one of our children our
[01:49.160 --> 01:53.400]  three-year-old our six-year-old daughters our eight-year-old son and she
[01:53.400 --> 02:01.640]  said that's right we better not fly I have had TSA security try to do this to
[02:01.640 --> 02:07.000]  me one time and I got very angry and told him no way and in that case they
[02:07.000 --> 02:11.760]  left me alone other people they will tell them leave the airport then and
[02:11.760 --> 02:19.560]  they then trigger a law of a federal regulation and charge you with a $11,000
[02:19.560 --> 02:23.960]  fine kind of like public schools say oh you won't take the vaccines we're gonna
[02:23.960 --> 02:27.480]  kick you out and then we're gonna charge you with truancy for not being in
[02:27.480 --> 02:31.960]  school there's no law to take vaccines but they all do it through deceptive
[02:31.960 --> 02:36.520]  criminal manipulation so you won't let us stick our hands down your pants or
[02:36.520 --> 02:41.580]  fondle your one-year-old or your six-year-old get out of here we're
[02:41.580 --> 02:48.080]  your master and then you leave and then they charge you later this is how the
[02:48.080 --> 02:54.160]  criminal mind works goons not even trained not sworn peace officers a
[02:54.160 --> 02:57.440]  sworn peace officer can't do this type of stuff we've had district attorneys on
[02:57.440 --> 03:01.680]  to break that down this is criminal but the feds don't care and they don't care
[03:01.680 --> 03:05.560]  how angry you get they don't care if this hurts the airlines this is about
[03:05.560 --> 03:11.400]  breaking your will and all over the country the federal government is
[03:11.400 --> 03:16.360]  lobbying and promising billions of dollars per major state hundreds of
[03:16.360 --> 03:20.360]  millions for smaller states they're promising Texas several billion dollars
[03:20.360 --> 03:25.360]  in highway funds just like they say we the feds say what the speed limit is and
[03:25.360 --> 03:29.240]  if the state doesn't agree you don't get the money they're saying Texas had better
[03:29.240 --> 03:35.120]  pass warrantless checkpoints or you won't get your money and here's the
[03:35.120 --> 03:39.520]  headline Texas could get sobriety checkpoints that's always the excuse
[03:39.520 --> 03:44.000]  it's always about stopping drunk drivers but then in 800 plus cities illegal
[03:44.000 --> 03:48.080]  aliens can be pulled over drunk with no insurance no driver's license they're
[03:48.080 --> 03:51.200]  let go on record
[03:52.200 --> 03:59.240]  Wacovia and Wells Fargo can launder 376 billion in drug money and run the drug
[03:59.240 --> 04:04.480]  aircraft lease the drug aircraft nobody gets in trouble foreign banks can rob
[04:04.480 --> 04:08.800]  tens of trillions of dollars from us nine core Halliburton and run giant
[04:08.800 --> 04:13.280]  child kidnapping rings it can come out in Congress no one gets in trouble but
[04:13.280 --> 04:19.600]  then the citizens have the book literally dropped on us and we have the
[04:19.600 --> 04:24.320]  biggest prison population in the world and now since it came out yesterday in
[04:24.320 --> 04:29.560]  the Chicago Tribune that multiple school districts in Chicago do not allow
[04:29.560 --> 04:35.640]  parents to pack any lunch not bananas not grapes not spinach nothing because you
[04:35.640 --> 04:39.680]  can't be trusted actually said parents can't be trusted so they're gonna put
[04:39.680 --> 04:42.800]  their hands down your children's pants they're not gonna let you pack their
[04:42.800 --> 04:48.040]  lunch you are a prisoner you're here to biologically supply them a new slave who
[04:48.040 --> 04:53.280]  will promptly be trained how to submit to slavery is a slavery induction we're
[04:53.280 --> 05:00.440]  gonna get into the latest book she meant it's huge the economy it's all coming up
[05:00.440 --> 05:04.480]  you've heard Alex explain how the silver lungs generator infuses the
[05:04.480 --> 05:08.480]  respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions yet
[05:08.480 --> 05:11.880]  many are unaware of the entire function of the silver lung system and how it has
[05:11.880 --> 05:16.720]  been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body my
[05:16.720 --> 05:20.360]  name is Mario Sephalde and I'm the developer of the silver lungs generator
[05:20.360 --> 05:24.560]  not only does the silver lung system produce endless colloidal and ionic
[05:24.560 --> 05:28.960]  silver solutions it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices
[05:28.960 --> 05:34.200]  needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas this
[05:34.200 --> 05:40.400]  includes the eyes ears nose lungs topically to the skin and orally for
[05:40.400 --> 05:44.360]  the digestive system be sure to watch our new seven minute video tour of the
[05:44.360 --> 05:50.440]  silver lung system at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the
[05:50.440 --> 05:55.240]  silver lung system works as well we are always ready to answer any questions you
[05:55.240 --> 06:01.600]  may have that's www.silverlungs.com this is Alex Jones with five good
[06:01.600 --> 06:05.600]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new
[06:05.600 --> 06:09.400]  climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[06:09.400 --> 06:13.760]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[06:13.760 --> 06:18.120]  you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[06:18.120 --> 06:22.560]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[06:22.560 --> 06:27.320]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[06:27.320 --> 06:31.120]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[06:31.120 --> 06:34.760]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[06:34.760 --> 06:39.080]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[06:39.080 --> 06:42.240]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[06:42.240 --> 06:45.920]  generators offered by solution from science one of my oldest sponsors you
[06:45.920 --> 06:50.720]  can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's my solar

[08:02.000 --> 08:08.240]  political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[08:08.240 --> 08:36.920]  we are back live ladies and gentlemen again it is Tuesday it is the 12th
[08:36.920 --> 08:43.800]  day of April 2011 and coming up in the last 40 minutes of the next
[08:43.800 --> 08:49.040]  hour dr. Bob Bowman nuclear physicist will be joining us to discuss Fukushima
[08:49.040 --> 08:53.920]  they are now telling the world what we knew more than three weeks ago and what
[08:53.920 --> 08:57.920]  we broke down here more than three weeks ago just a week or so into the
[08:57.920 --> 09:02.840]  disaster that this is as bad as Chernobyl or many times worse as dr.
[09:02.840 --> 09:09.360]  Christopher Busby has stated one of the leading radiation crises researchers in
[09:09.360 --> 09:13.640]  Europe he'll also be joining us coming up for 30 minutes in the third hour
[09:13.640 --> 09:19.640]  today I hate to be right but governments always tend to act the same
[09:19.640 --> 09:24.720]  they engage in deception they engage in manipulation and here's the big news
[09:24.720 --> 09:30.640]  flash all over the United States in milk in water supplies now they're picking
[09:30.640 --> 09:35.320]  up higher and higher levels of radiation and as you know the EPA's response to
[09:35.320 --> 09:40.560]  this is to say let us not eat cake let us drink and eat radiation they're just
[09:40.560 --> 09:46.240]  raising the levels that they say are safe this is because a criminal culture
[09:46.240 --> 09:52.920]  of denial has seeped into every level of government in this country we're going
[09:52.920 --> 09:59.280]  to be going over all of that today in fact here is just some of those headlines
[09:59.280 --> 10:03.120]  but we'll get into it in great detail with dr. Bob Bowman and dr. Christopher
[10:03.120 --> 10:08.640]  Busby Christopher Busby of course is a chemical physicist dr. Bob Bowman has
[10:08.640 --> 10:12.600]  three degrees in nuclear physics and aeronautics as the former head of the
[10:12.600 --> 10:19.960]  Star Wars weapons system program going through some of these headlines Fukushima
[10:19.960 --> 10:25.120]  introduces deadly strontium into the environment Japan ups new crisis
[10:25.120 --> 10:30.600]  severity to match Chernobyl as a number seven nuclear crises are listed from a
[10:30.600 --> 10:37.080]  one to a seven seven being the worst known crises again here CNBC Japan
[10:37.080 --> 10:41.240]  raises nuclear crisis the same level as Chernobyl here's another story out of
[10:41.240 --> 10:46.160]  Reuters slight amounts of strontium found near crippled Japan nuclear power
[10:46.160 --> 10:51.360]  plant here's another headline tepco wary of Fukushima radiation leak
[10:51.360 --> 10:57.920]  exceeding Chernobyl and they're back with moralizing well it's listed as bad as
[10:57.920 --> 11:03.240]  Chernobyl but we've only released 10% as much as Chernobyl and then they go on
[11:03.240 --> 11:07.360]  to say we had containment facilities around these these reactors ladies and
[11:07.360 --> 11:12.400]  gentlemen you saw the can the outer containment shells blow sky high and
[11:12.400 --> 11:17.160]  reactor one and three the others all extremely damaged as well with
[11:17.160 --> 11:22.840]  explosions and fires and ongoing smoking and off and on evacuations and
[11:22.840 --> 11:26.600]  more earthquakes hitting yesterday and the New York Times confirming from
[11:26.600 --> 11:32.160]  Japanese government documents hundreds of thousands of the 600,000 plus fuel
[11:32.160 --> 11:37.840]  rods spent fuel rods stored on top the reactors spewed as far away as a mile I
[11:37.840 --> 11:41.240]  mean we could see them being ejected when reactor three blew up with that
[11:41.240 --> 11:45.040]  mushroom cloud 3,000 feet in the air and I said those look like fuel rods and I
[11:45.040 --> 11:49.800]  had nuclear experts on it said yes those appear to be fuel rods and the Japanese
[11:49.800 --> 11:55.800]  government responded by burying them on the spot wherever they found them with
[11:55.800 --> 12:03.040]  dirt forgot to turn my cell phone off will you guys kill that sorry I normally
[12:03.040 --> 12:09.240]  have the phone off but it's it's going off on me in here so continuing with
[12:09.240 --> 12:14.840]  this information here's another headline from natural news and then they
[12:14.840 --> 12:22.240]  have links to the government's own reporting systems Fukushima radiation
[12:22.240 --> 12:31.200]  tanks US milk supplies at levels 300 percent higher than EPA maximums but the
[12:31.200 --> 12:36.160]  issue here is depending on what type of radioactive isotope they've raised the
[12:36.160 --> 12:44.480]  different isotopes from 1000 times safe levels to 24,000 plus times almost 25,000
[12:44.480 --> 12:52.160]  times safe levels and so their response is to simply raise the levels and of
[12:52.160 --> 12:55.760]  course it's come out now in ABC news as a listener pointed out yesterday and we
[12:55.760 --> 12:59.880]  pulled it up that will you guys print me that ABC news article you just search the
[12:59.880 --> 13:07.000]  term semi valley meltdown and you'll get ABC news they've just now decided to
[13:07.000 --> 13:11.320]  tell us that there was a reactor the first power reactor in the US in the
[13:11.320 --> 13:16.080]  early 1950s that completely melted down and they kept its secret from the
[13:16.080 --> 13:22.280]  public and radiated that area here are the numbers from the state government's
[13:22.280 --> 13:27.040]  collated by natural news again this is up on info wars dot com and prison
[13:27.040 --> 13:35.800]  planet dot com by Ethan a Huff and this is the numbers Los Angeles California has
[13:35.800 --> 13:41.200]  highly elevated levels of different radioactive isotopes iodine 131
[13:41.200 --> 13:50.040]  cesium 134 cesium 137 and it gives you the numbers Los
[13:50.040 --> 13:54.680]  Angeles California 0.39 and then it gives a different isotopes that have been
[13:54.680 --> 14:04.840]  found Philadelphia Baxter Pennsylvania 0.46 of cesium Philadelphia Belmont
[14:04.840 --> 14:14.200]  Pennsylvania 1.3 of cesium people keep sending me emails saying it's cesium
[14:14.200 --> 14:20.560]  there's cesium and cesium ladies and gentlemen continuing muscle shoals
[14:20.560 --> 14:26.600]  Alabama Niagara Falls New York Denver Colorado Detroit Michigan East Liverpool
[14:26.600 --> 14:32.280]  Ohio Trenton New Jersey Painesville Ohio Columbia Pennsylvania Oak Ridge
[14:32.280 --> 14:37.600]  Tennessee and it just goes through all these levels Richmond Washington Boise
[14:37.600 --> 14:44.240]  Idaho Chattanooga Tennessee Pittsburgh Pennsylvania Cincinnati Ohio Watertown
[14:44.240 --> 14:49.640]  New Jersey Helena Montana and these are coming out of state agencies and being
[14:49.640 --> 14:59.760]  collated the feds are not releasing numbers they're not testing and the
[14:59.760 --> 15:04.680]  mainstream media is basically playing along with all of this to not report on
[15:04.680 --> 15:14.880]  what's going on so we're going to be breaking all of that down today as well
[15:14.880 --> 15:21.360]  and here is the ABC News headline decades later semi-valley nuclear meltdown
[15:21.360 --> 15:30.160]  still impacts lives this is out of KABC there in Southern California in 1959 a
[15:30.160 --> 15:36.160]  2,900 acre California plant suffered a massive nuclear meltdown it remains the
[15:36.160 --> 15:41.040]  worst in US history for the radiation that was released the accident at Santa
[15:41.040 --> 15:47.880]  Susanna Field Laboratory or Rocketdyne as it was known previously left large
[15:47.880 --> 15:53.160]  rates of toxic contamination radiation and chemicals in semi-valley in Los
[15:53.160 --> 15:57.760]  Angeles County neighborhoods and then it just goes in to break down how for
[15:57.760 --> 16:06.720]  decades they kept its secret from the public so it's standard default position
[16:07.240 --> 16:14.040]  when there's an emergency when there's a crisis that the system cannot and will
[16:14.040 --> 16:18.200]  not help you and they will lie to you and then they will do everything they can
[16:18.200 --> 16:22.400]  to make sure that you don't learn about the crisis so that you can avert the
[16:22.400 --> 16:28.200]  danger yourself because they don't want any liabilities they want to continue to
[16:28.200 --> 16:33.080]  build these dangerous reactors they want to continue to mine phosphate for
[16:33.080 --> 16:38.600]  fertilizer production and take the byproduct a toxic mix of sodium fluoride
[16:38.600 --> 16:45.520]  arsenic lead mercury uranium and and other radioactive isotopes and dump it in
[16:45.520 --> 16:50.400]  your water and then when the state agencies test the water in Texas and
[16:50.400 --> 16:54.520]  Alabama and other states and say well we've got ten to a hundred times safe
[16:54.520 --> 16:59.200]  levels of radioactive isotopes in the drinking water added to it the fed's
[16:59.200 --> 17:02.760]  answer is cover it up and that of course I've been talking a lot about the last
[17:02.760 --> 17:06.040]  three months since that came out we talked about them mining the phosphate
[17:06.040 --> 17:09.800]  that had radioactive isotopes previously and gone over those documents but now
[17:09.800 --> 17:15.880]  it's clear that they're covering it up and continuing because the policy is to
[17:15.880 --> 17:20.800]  add these radioactive isotopes no only to the water because it creates massive
[17:20.800 --> 17:26.200]  cancers and massive infertility and I saw another headline yesterday with
[17:26.200 --> 17:31.120]  government numbers the sperm count is accelerating its drop from 87 to now
[17:31.120 --> 17:37.600]  close to 90% and if this continues it's estimated that almost all males will be
[17:37.600 --> 17:43.000]  completely sterile by 2025 in the United States in Europe in England
[17:43.000 --> 17:48.880]  globalist mission complete and this is not an issue oh no they've got to have
[17:48.880 --> 17:52.680]  surveillance blimps and surveillance aircraft and the cops train your kids
[17:52.680 --> 17:57.160]  how to be spies and roadside checkpoints to quote stop drunk drivers really train
[17:57.160 --> 18:00.320]  you to accept checkpoints the TSA is going to stick their hands down your
[18:00.320 --> 18:04.000]  pants because yeah you've got a lesser chance of a terrorist killing you than
[18:04.000 --> 18:08.840]  being dying from a bee sting from a allergic response you got a better
[18:08.840 --> 18:12.400]  chance from dying from peanut allergies than being killed by terrorists those
[18:12.400 --> 18:16.240]  those reports have been written those numbers have been documented they don't
[18:16.240 --> 18:22.520]  care it's all about but isn't a scary man with a beard isn't it fun to get
[18:22.520 --> 18:26.240]  scared and and beg the government to have men in black uniforms come take
[18:26.240 --> 18:31.440]  care of you isn't it fun to have all these cameras surveilling you and
[18:31.440 --> 18:38.920]  controlling you so that's just some of the news and reports that we have on
[18:38.920 --> 18:44.320]  that front also in the economy you know over the weekend George Soros told
[18:44.320 --> 18:49.000]  Bloomberg we played the clip yesterday that the dollar is already not the world
[18:49.000 --> 18:52.760]  reserve currency and is being phased out and that that was the consensus
[18:52.760 --> 18:58.200]  developed by the private and government banker heads at the Bretton Woods
[18:58.200 --> 19:03.360]  meeting in New Hampshire over the weekend and he's continued by telling the
[19:03.360 --> 19:07.960]  news that the country could actually absorb more debt well of course he
[19:07.960 --> 19:14.760]  gets the free insider trading fiat instruments for nothing and then he
[19:14.760 --> 19:20.120]  and then he induces government minions to go deeper into debt to his system and
[19:20.120 --> 19:29.280]  his his coterie system and he gets the world for free so of course you can
[19:29.280 --> 19:37.120]  absorb more debt and Ron Paul has come out and pointed out that of the 37 to
[19:37.120 --> 19:41.040]  40 billion that was cut those were cuts that already been agreed on last year
[19:41.040 --> 19:45.280]  and that most of it was just leftover money and things from highway projects
[19:45.280 --> 19:50.200]  and that nothing's being changed they're they're just manipulating the numbers
[19:50.200 --> 19:54.280]  because that's what the Republican and Democratic leadership want they're not
[19:54.280 --> 19:58.560]  screwing up they want you to drink uranium they want you to be bankrupt

[21:07.480 --> 21:10.800]  relies on the Treasury continuously selling large amounts of government
[21:10.800 --> 21:16.080]  bonds to foreign central banks with Japan about to become a seller of US bonds
[21:16.080 --> 21:21.200]  in order to rebuild its own nation and the US antagonizing China by calling them
[21:21.200 --> 21:25.080]  currency manipulators the Federal Reserve which is already buying about 70%
[21:25.080 --> 21:29.880]  of US Treasuries will soon be the only buyer left of US Treasuries our friends
[21:29.880 --> 21:33.560]  at the National Inflation Association believe that the US dollar will soon

[24:04.680 --> 24:11.040]  I hear the train coming it's rolling around the bend and I've seen the
[24:11.040 --> 24:18.000]  sun shines I don't know when I'm stuck in fools and prisons and time keeps
[24:18.000 --> 24:22.520]  dragging on here in the break jaren was asking hey of any of the Fukushima 50
[24:22.520 --> 24:29.520]  gotten sick and I said search it and there is the daily mail out of England
[24:29.520 --> 24:34.640]  with the headline three of Fukushima 50 rushed to hospital with radiation
[24:34.640 --> 24:39.400]  poisoning as Panic Tokyo residents clear shop shelves of bottled water that
[24:39.400 --> 24:45.800]  was from a couple weeks ago on March 24th and of course the director of the
[24:45.800 --> 24:49.160]  plant has been in and out of the hospital but they won't ever really say
[24:49.160 --> 24:54.480]  why undoubtedly Japan admittedly has engaged in a cover-up the governor of
[24:54.480 --> 24:59.600]  that state the prefecture of Fukushima has said there's been a cover-up and we've
[24:59.600 --> 25:03.480]  been trying to translate and go over the local Japanese news and there have been
[25:03.480 --> 25:08.200]  some reports of people with red faces and vomiting but when you've got the
[25:08.200 --> 25:11.760]  Japanese government covering up when you've got our government raising safe
[25:11.760 --> 25:19.520]  radiation levels this is a big big deal and it shows how these bureaucrats think
[25:19.520 --> 25:23.840]  we're stupid that they can just raise safe radiation levels and then it's out
[25:23.840 --> 25:30.760]  of sight out of mind and oh it is as bad as what happened at Chernobyl but it's
[25:30.760 --> 25:36.320]  not as bad as what happened at Chernobyl all right that said I want to get
[25:36.320 --> 25:42.440]  into the TSA if you go up to info wars.com we posted this yesterday
[25:42.440 --> 25:47.040]  afternoon and then the drudge report picked it up today six-year-old girl
[25:47.040 --> 25:55.880]  groped then drug tested by TSA and drudge has the big headline LinkedIn red with
[25:55.880 --> 26:02.200]  the headline that the TSA is still groping children and I'm not gonna play
[26:02.200 --> 26:05.320]  the video here quite frankly I've watched it two or three times it's very
[26:05.320 --> 26:11.800]  painful to watch if you want to go see the video it's at info wars.com and this
[26:11.800 --> 26:16.960]  is the face of what America has turned into the incredibly over-the-top
[26:16.960 --> 26:25.960]  behavior of newborn babies two-year-old boys six-year-old girls being pulled out
[26:25.960 --> 26:35.480]  and and I witnessed this when I was in San Jose back late last year flying back
[26:35.480 --> 26:40.120]  from Santa Cruz where I gave a speech also went out there to be part of the
[26:40.120 --> 26:45.400]  history channels show on Bohemian Grove killed two birds with one stone and I
[26:45.400 --> 26:48.680]  noticed that it was only women and children they were searching and putting
[26:48.680 --> 26:51.520]  through scanners and they put them through scanners and then they'd grope
[26:51.520 --> 26:58.320]  them and I've noticed this when I fly other places they like to target groups
[26:58.320 --> 27:02.520]  that won't resist that won't talk back and of course the low-level bureaucrats
[27:02.520 --> 27:08.160]  the minimum wage goons violating people inducting them into the slavery they
[27:08.160 --> 27:10.360]  don't understand what they're doing they believe it's really to stop terrorists
[27:10.360 --> 27:13.880]  most of them others are perverts and control freaks has been evidenced by
[27:13.880 --> 27:18.040]  how many TSA workers have been arrested for pedophilia trying to rape women
[27:18.040 --> 27:21.760]  going crazy declaring themselves God and stripping down naked and running
[27:21.760 --> 27:25.440]  around I mean you know I mean they take people that couldn't keep a job at
[27:25.440 --> 27:29.320]  McDonald's and teach them that there's terrorists around every corner and then
[27:29.320 --> 27:33.520]  they tell them search all the women search the little children because they
[27:33.520 --> 27:38.280]  will submit and we're here to break their will and that's basically what's
[27:38.280 --> 27:42.680]  going on and they intend to just continue to throw this in our face till we
[27:42.680 --> 27:51.840]  become acclimated I remember ten years ago there was a article out of one of
[27:51.840 --> 27:57.360]  the Chicago papers and then following it I found the minutes of a big symposium
[27:57.360 --> 28:02.160]  they were having in Chicago of the RFID manufacturers of the world the radio
[28:02.160 --> 28:12.560]  frequency identification devices and at this big event this conference or more
[28:12.560 --> 28:19.240]  than a conference it was a convention at the convention there were the minutes
[28:19.240 --> 28:24.720]  of the head of it and they said our studies show that 87% of Americans are
[28:24.720 --> 28:29.960]  extremely upset about RFID but our studies also show that if we just force
[28:29.960 --> 28:34.800]  it in and that if we do it in a unified way they will finally break and submit
[28:34.800 --> 28:40.400]  to it and then accept it and that's that's the mindset and I was flying to
[28:40.400 --> 28:44.640]  New York to be on the view and some other TV stations a few months ago they
[28:44.640 --> 28:50.520]  flew me up there in first class because it was on their dime I demanded it ABC's
[28:50.520 --> 28:57.400]  the view and I was sitting next to a banker a head banker of a major U.S.
[28:57.400 --> 29:02.280]  Bank and he figured out who I was we were having a polite argument for the two
[29:02.280 --> 29:10.920]  and a half hour flight and he just looked at me and he said Alex people just
[29:10.920 --> 29:15.000]  muddle through things people just put up with things and that's why you're not
[29:15.000 --> 29:21.480]  gonna have a big resistance in this country so their attitude is hey we're
[29:21.480 --> 29:25.720]  gonna pull your six-year-old out of line we're gonna sit there and stick our
[29:25.720 --> 29:29.320]  hands down their pants we're gonna grab their crotch we're gonna do it to your
[29:29.320 --> 29:34.160]  wife and we're doing to you and we're gonna put you in a radiation baker now

[34:52.920 --> 34:57.880]  other tissue sample testing when you get a driver's license last year we saw
[34:57.880 --> 35:01.800]  an article out of the Washington Post about how great it is that they're
[35:01.800 --> 35:06.200]  going to start HIV testing when you get your driver's license in the district of
[35:06.200 --> 35:12.680]  Columbia they're passing through agenda 21 even if Congress doesn't pass the law
[35:12.680 --> 35:19.600]  the feds with the with their unfunded mandates come in and basically force the
[35:19.600 --> 35:23.640]  states not just here but all over the world with the continuity of agenda to
[35:23.640 --> 35:30.800]  start international regulations on zoning of homes on building of a new barn

[35:35.040 --> 35:40.760]  off no dust when they till the soil but then the big agribusiness they get
[35:40.760 --> 35:45.160]  waivers for it all over the country they're moving to make you get a license
[35:45.160 --> 35:51.960]  to have a garden in your own backyard in California and areas of Oklahoma

[36:21.440 --> 36:25.360]  cockroaches they're more cockroaches than there are humans there are more
[36:25.360 --> 36:29.000]  insects than there are humans there are more plants than there are humans and
[36:29.000 --> 36:35.200]  see they don't get to vote themselves but the UN will vote for them oh you
[36:35.200 --> 36:40.880]  still get your rights but they're trumped if the carbon dioxide coming out of a
[36:40.880 --> 36:46.840]  coal plant if we say it's toxic waste now we're gonna put a tax on it paid
[36:46.840 --> 36:53.480]  directly to the private banks and people like George Soros Bolivia will this
[36:53.480 --> 36:57.080]  month table a draft of United Nations treaty giving mother earth the same
[36:57.080 --> 37:02.520]  rights as humans having just passed a domestic law that does the same for
[37:02.520 --> 37:08.200]  bugs trees and all other natural things in the South American country but don't
[37:08.200 --> 37:14.200]  worry you can pay taxes to still be able to chop down those crops and bring
[37:14.200 --> 37:19.040]  them to market but those plants those food plants do have rights instead of the
[37:19.040 --> 37:23.840]  insects the bid aims to have the UN recognize the earth as a living entity
[37:23.840 --> 37:28.000]  that humans have sought to dominate and exploit to the point that the well-being
[37:28.000 --> 37:32.240]  and existence of many beings in and is now threatened and they can argue the
[37:32.240 --> 37:35.440]  earth's got some problems even though it was born out of fire and is very
[37:35.440 --> 37:39.560]  resilient but they're not stopping genetically engineered crops that
[37:39.560 --> 37:42.880]  change the entire biosphere no that's racing forward they're not stopping
[37:42.880 --> 37:48.280]  chimera across species mammals being mixed with plants and insects they're
[37:48.280 --> 37:52.640]  not stopping cows that produce human milk that are part human they're not
[37:52.640 --> 37:57.560]  stopping spiders that are in goats that have been mixed together with spider
[37:57.560 --> 38:01.800]  goats to create body armor in their milk they're not stopping all the super
[38:01.800 --> 38:06.040]  conducting super colliders engaged in very dangerous experiments that they
[38:06.040 --> 38:11.080]  admit could damage or even destroy the planet I mean they developed the atomic
[38:11.080 --> 38:18.120]  theory 111 years ago what do you think they have now none of this none of this
[38:18.120 --> 38:21.880]  has anything to do with protecting the planet just like pulling a six-year-old
[38:21.880 --> 38:25.160]  over who's wearing a tight shirt and little pants clearly doesn't have a
[38:25.160 --> 38:30.640]  bomb or drugs and the TSA woman for several minutes squeezes her arms
[38:30.640 --> 38:34.200]  squeezes her legs sticks her hands between her legs squeezes her goes in her
[38:34.200 --> 38:40.000]  pants you can watch the video at info wars.com six-year-old girl groped then
[38:40.000 --> 38:43.920]  drug tested by TSA and then the woman says okay now I'm gonna lead you over
[38:43.920 --> 38:50.040]  here it's time for the drug test and you hear the little girl saying I don't
[38:50.040 --> 38:53.400]  want to do this you hear some other children watching who were waiting
[38:53.400 --> 38:56.760]  because again for what I've witnessed it's mainly women and children they do
[38:56.760 --> 39:01.160]  this to women and children first into the inferno of tyranny and you hear
[39:01.160 --> 39:04.720]  children saying I don't want them to do that to my clothes I don't know no I
[39:04.720 --> 39:11.800]  mean imagine sometimes you'll see a little cousin or something I haven't
[39:11.800 --> 39:14.560]  seen in a month and you'll run over when they're two or three and say give me a
[39:14.560 --> 39:21.320]  hug and they're shy I've even with my son and two daughters they would go
[39:21.320 --> 39:24.560]  through brief periods generally when they were about two years old that I've
[39:24.560 --> 39:29.360]  been gone all day and sometimes I'd say give me a hug give me a kiss and they'd
[39:29.360 --> 39:34.920]  say mommy no and and be shy or my parents would come over who they see
[39:34.920 --> 39:40.200]  every week and they would you know run and hug mommy I mean that's just how
[39:40.200 --> 39:45.400]  children are even with their own parents sometimes but now in a big airport with
[39:45.400 --> 39:49.120]  all these adults around all these people looking in lights and big machines and
[39:49.120 --> 39:54.840]  people in authoritative uniforms with their obese potbellies hanging over
[39:54.840 --> 39:59.040]  taking your child and parents sometimes said no don't do that and they'll shove
[39:59.040 --> 40:03.200]  the parents back and get back we've got a bunch of the newscast posted under this
[40:03.200 --> 40:06.760]  new video where that's happened and the child will start crying and they'll rip
[40:06.760 --> 40:13.280]  the shirt off or a woman they'll pull her blouse off in Amarillo and she'll
[40:13.280 --> 40:16.840]  start crying and then the men come over and say man you've got really nice
[40:16.840 --> 40:21.120]  breast so she won a lawsuit I mean they just think everything is their
[40:21.120 --> 40:25.800]  authority they think they're God just strutting around in a government
[40:25.800 --> 40:32.080]  bureaucrat riot an orgy of oppression against us and they just continue it
[40:32.080 --> 40:37.200]  and continue it and continue it and continue it against us and they're not
[40:37.200 --> 40:45.240]  going to stop until we say no if they get away with this the sky is the limit
[40:45.240 --> 40:51.000]  and they've basically already reached the sky they've already gone past with
[40:51.000 --> 40:54.000]  social engineering when any other government's ever done I talk a lot
[40:54.000 --> 40:59.200]  about this because it's such a big deal but every month or so I see articles
[40:59.200 --> 41:04.360]  and it's always an unannounced school safety drill angered parents and
[41:04.360 --> 41:07.560]  children the elementary students were taken into the parking lot and then
[41:07.560 --> 41:11.160]  told that terrorists who were against public schools were attacking police
[41:11.160 --> 41:15.080]  dressed as part of the federally funded drill and camouflage began to scream
[41:15.080 --> 41:19.960]  we're going to kill you because we don't like public school students
[41:19.960 --> 41:24.560]  associated press Michigan did all over the state and then the police are on
[41:24.560 --> 41:29.040]  there going now wait a minute we got a federal grant and the federal grant says
[41:29.040 --> 41:35.160]  this is how we do it what Alabama two weeks ago unannounced drill telling the
[41:35.160 --> 41:45.800]  kids they're going to kill them and that they were adults IE parents against
[41:45.800 --> 41:51.840]  illegal immigration and so the idea is oh a pro gun group attacked the school
[41:51.840 --> 41:56.040]  today a pro sovereignty group attacked the school today a pro homeschooling
[41:56.040 --> 41:59.560]  group attacked the school and I've had the teachers on with their lawyers where
[41:59.560 --> 42:04.720]  they come out to the portable building men in uniforms or camo and take them
[42:04.720 --> 42:07.680]  out in the woods and say now we're going to execute you and the people all
[42:07.680 --> 42:12.320]  have nervous breakdowns the kids have nightmares but most the parents don't
[42:12.320 --> 42:15.960]  want to accuse the authority figures of engaging in a mass reeducation camp
[42:15.960 --> 42:21.560]  brainwashing situation so they twist it and say those dirty homeschoolers we
[42:21.560 --> 42:24.960]  had to do it because the homeschoolers want to blow the school up and
[42:24.960 --> 42:29.760]  sometimes they're again rolling a bus or a car and they set it on fire and it
[42:29.760 --> 42:34.500]  blows up in front of everyone this is on the news they even blow a car up in
[42:34.500 --> 42:38.240]  front of little kids in fact when I asked you to search that yesterday I
[42:38.240 --> 42:41.560]  know I keep going back to this one did you find the article where they make
[42:41.560 --> 42:46.200]  them you know the school wanted to be more realistic so while the mass gunmen
[42:46.200 --> 42:50.160]  went to the school for eight hours being played by the local police the
[42:50.160 --> 42:53.800]  children were not allowed to eat lunch and had to use the bathroom in trash
[42:53.800 --> 42:57.920]  cans and then the school principal was on the news going we wanted this to be
[42:57.920 --> 43:02.520]  as realistic as possible during the true lockdown we understand this can be seen
[43:02.520 --> 43:07.600]  as traumatic but it's for your safety anything for safety well that case was
[43:07.600 --> 43:11.440]  about five years ago I played that newscast over and over again on air to
[43:11.440 --> 43:16.440]  find that during drill children made to use the bathroom in in buckets or
[43:16.440 --> 43:23.200]  trash cans that was one thing we couldn't find what we'll keep looking for
[43:23.200 --> 43:27.960]  that because I remember that happening so all of this is going on I mean we're
[43:27.960 --> 43:34.000]  in a hardcore revolution against liberty there's a hardcore overturning of the
[43:34.000 --> 43:39.880]  existing order of personal space liberty innocent until proven guilty and on top
[43:39.880 --> 43:44.840]  of it all I read the quotes out of the Chicago Tribune yesterday where the
[43:44.840 --> 43:49.240]  principal and the school spokesperson for the different Chicago school
[43:49.240 --> 43:53.400]  districts that are doing this saying well the school makes better choices the
[43:53.400 --> 44:01.640]  school has better food and we're sorry you know parents cannot be trusted to
[44:02.400 --> 44:08.360]  make the school lunches I mean the message is we own your children and
[44:08.360 --> 44:11.960]  while they're in these public schools I mean look if you want an example of how
[44:11.960 --> 44:16.680]  deceptive government is just at the grassroots level it's default training
[44:16.680 --> 44:19.760]  with the school nurse and with the assistant principal and the principal
[44:19.760 --> 44:23.840]  and countless parents have called me an email me and said exactly what you said
[44:23.840 --> 44:31.160]  happened because I've experienced it over the years doing research and talking
[44:31.160 --> 44:36.080]  to families they have the waiver form that's a waiver for something that isn't
[44:36.080 --> 44:40.760]  even a law by color of law they say your child hadn't been vaccinated we're gonna
[44:40.760 --> 44:43.080]  kick them out of school and then once we kick them out we're gonna charge them
[44:43.080 --> 44:47.680]  with truancy which itself is a fraud there's no law to take the vaccine then
[44:47.680 --> 44:50.240]  when they kick you out of school you're not supposed to be charged with truancy
[44:50.240 --> 44:54.560]  because under the laws of the 50 states they're universal that's not truancy if
[44:54.560 --> 44:58.800]  you're kicked out but they don't care they've still got juvenile courts that
[44:58.800 --> 45:03.720]  will haul you in there the parents have no knowledge of the law and they will
[45:03.720 --> 45:07.240]  put you in juvenile hall which will then be good criminal training for you and
[45:07.240 --> 45:11.520]  hopefully ruin your life they love that and create more criminals by throwing
[45:11.520 --> 45:16.980]  your 12 year old in with you know 15 16 17 year olds so it's this path into the
[45:16.980 --> 45:21.320]  prisons the schools are designed to brainwash you make you subservient main
[45:21.320 --> 45:26.120]  line a lot of people to go into prison and so the parents go in and say well I
[45:26.120 --> 45:29.120]  don't have to vaccinate there's no law and they say what are you talking about
[45:29.120 --> 45:34.720]  Mrs. Johnson yes it's the law you're gonna be suspended you say I know you
[45:34.720 --> 45:38.000]  have that waiver form in that file cabinet what right there behind you and
[45:38.000 --> 45:48.280]  they'll say oh you mean the waiver form yes I forgot these are hard core hard
[45:48.280 --> 45:58.120]  core hard core hard core anti-American brainwashed Nazi scum they're lying to
[45:58.120 --> 46:02.840]  you and telling that's not harsh terms for that they're there lying to you
[46:02.840 --> 46:09.280]  sending letters home calling you saying junior is gonna be thrown out little
[46:09.280 --> 46:16.920]  Betty is gonna be thrown out of school unless she takes this vaccine unless he
[46:16.920 --> 46:20.200]  takes it and they've got new ones they're trying to mandate every year and
[46:20.200 --> 46:23.680]  the big pharma comes in and just finances the state governors and then put
[46:23.680 --> 46:27.320]  it on the list of mandatory vaccines that means mandatory on their recommended
[46:27.320 --> 46:31.600]  list than a color of law engage in fraud this is a government that doesn't just
[46:31.600 --> 46:35.000]  put sodium fluoride in your water knowing it gives a seven-fold increase in
[46:35.000 --> 46:40.080]  bone cancer for men three-fold increase for women this is a government that
[46:40.080 --> 46:44.840]  knowingly minds phosphate with radioactive isotopes at high levels and
[46:44.840 --> 46:49.440]  puts it in your water to give you cancer and sterilize you just like the
[46:49.440 --> 46:51.800]  federal government's been caught all over the world shooting people up with
[46:51.800 --> 46:55.800]  live cephalus telling them it's a vaccine program they love to target
[46:55.800 --> 47:00.320]  children they love to murder children they want to murder you and your family
[47:00.320 --> 47:05.280]  now the mindless nurse or the mindless principal is just a bootlicking
[47:05.280 --> 47:09.560]  follower that does whatever they're told and the teacher that doesn't do
[47:09.560 --> 47:15.120]  whatever they're told they never become any type of administrator the teacher
[47:15.120 --> 47:19.440]  that wants to teach and is a good smart person they stay low-level and are
[47:19.440 --> 47:28.200]  basically harassed by the throng of communistic rainwashed compliers and the
[47:28.200 --> 47:31.720]  I mean why do you think the principals are getting paid 200 300 grand a year
[47:31.720 --> 47:41.360]  why do you think school administrators you know the head of the school district
[47:41.360 --> 47:46.680]  superintendents in some cases are paid 500 600 700 I've seen cases 800 foul
[47:46.680 --> 47:51.240]  they're paid $800,000 because it feels good to go play golf at three o'clock it
[47:51.240 --> 47:56.240]  feels good to live in a big mansion it feels good to just be a yes man who
[47:56.240 --> 48:00.440]  doesn't even think about it and trains everybody how to lie and trains everybody
[48:00.440 --> 48:03.680]  how to get all the kids shot up remember what happened during the swine flu
[48:03.680 --> 48:10.400]  situation in 2009 we first started getting reports from listeners it's like
[48:10.400 --> 48:13.880]  we got reports eight nine months ago they were sticking their hands down
[48:13.880 --> 48:16.760]  people's pants and people couldn't believe it till it happened to one of my employees
[48:16.760 --> 48:21.800]  then reporters started coming out from TV radio Prince saying it happened to me
[48:21.800 --> 48:25.760]  then TSA admitted they were doing it first they just lied to said they weren't
[48:25.760 --> 48:31.440]  even though it was the policy again a policy of deception I just digressed off
[48:31.440 --> 48:36.160]  into TSA what was the point I was talking about right before that
[48:38.440 --> 48:42.920]  yeah well I mean I was giving one example how there's universal lying and
[48:42.920 --> 48:47.480]  I went back into TSA and I was going to go back and show the culture of lying in
[48:47.480 --> 48:50.200]  another area
[48:51.560 --> 48:58.320]  oh the the the swine flu so just like we got reports months and months before it
[48:58.320 --> 49:02.720]  was confirmed from listeners that they were sticking hands down pants
[49:02.720 --> 49:08.640]  universally for those pulled aside for the expanded pat downs that TSA admits is
[49:08.640 --> 49:13.080]  going to go to everyone soon just like quote everyone will be body scanned as they
[49:13.080 --> 49:18.960]  told the Chicago Tribune again last year it's a training process it was the
[49:18.960 --> 49:23.200]  same thing we got all these calls saying listen they shot my six-year-old up
[49:23.200 --> 49:27.160]  with a swine flu and didn't even tell me and then it showed up in Houston and
[49:27.160 --> 49:31.760]  then it showed up in Georgia and then it showed up in California unified fraud
[49:31.760 --> 49:35.840]  where they would take your child in even if you'd given them letters and orders
[49:35.840 --> 49:39.960]  not to vaccinate them and they would shoot your child up with the dangerous
[49:39.960 --> 49:45.000]  h1n1 that increased Guillain beret all sorts of neurological disorders all
[49:45.000 --> 49:50.320]  sorts of problems on record and every time they got caught they said gee we're
[49:50.320 --> 49:57.760]  real sorry we we didn't look at the paperwork correctly we didn't look at
[49:57.760 --> 50:05.800]  the paperwork correctly we are so sorry that this happened we are we we just
[50:05.800 --> 50:12.240]  have to sit here and just shake our heads we are so upset that that we
[50:12.240 --> 50:21.880]  accidentally vaccinated your child it was all a big accident this is a
[50:21.880 --> 50:27.000]  government that has gone through the 310 million population and given people
[50:27.000 --> 50:32.600]  petty jobs in the system and if they follow orders and if they're stupid and
[50:32.600 --> 50:37.960]  if they'll lie and if they'll follow whatever they're told they move up why
[50:37.960 --> 50:41.320]  they could move up to us senator they can move up to president they can move
[50:41.320 --> 50:47.360]  up to ceo if you'll play ball and that's why the elite themselves are so

[52:35.220 --> 52:39.720]  survive but prosper during the upcoming hyperinflation crisis silver has more
[52:39.720 --> 52:43.200]  than doubled since the NIA declared silver the best investment for the next
[52:43.200 --> 52:48.480]  decade on inflation.us the NIA's team of expert economists are happy to answer

[52:57.720 --> 53:02.160]  truth that the mainstream media ignores hi this is Alex Jones did you know that
[53:02.160 --> 53:05.560]  the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage
[53:05.560 --> 53:09.480]  vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid
[53:09.480 --> 53:13.080]  seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds about
[53:13.080 --> 53:16.440]  performing gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could
[53:16.440 --> 53:20.280]  even happen again so our friends at Solutions from Science have put together
[53:20.280 --> 53:25.680]  the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it can
[53:25.680 --> 53:29.840]  produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family
[53:29.840 --> 53:33.200]  and here's the best part these seeds have not been genetically modified in
[53:33.200 --> 53:37.960]  any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden so
[53:37.960 --> 53:43.520]  visit them today at survivalseedbank.com that's survivalseedbank.com or give
[53:43.520 --> 53:53.880]  them a call at 877-327-0365 that's 877-327-0365 remember in a real crisis
[53:53.880 --> 53:57.960]  non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item this is Alex Jones for
[53:57.960 --> 54:01.080]  survivalseedbank.com
[54:01.080 --> 54:29.800]  the government is too big
[54:29.800 --> 54:34.680]  it's out of control it's controlled by corrupt offshore corporations and
[54:34.680 --> 54:40.400]  banks who have openly stated they not only want to turn us into domesticated
[54:40.400 --> 54:45.640]  dumb-down slaves that's only a means to an end to forcibly reduce world
[54:45.640 --> 54:51.240]  population Japan only has 1.2 children for every two adults they're dying
[54:51.240 --> 54:57.960]  Italy has 1.2 children England 1.4 the United States is dying except for the
[54:57.960 --> 55:02.760]  giant immigrant population coming in the globalist are carrying out their
[55:02.760 --> 55:08.840]  program and they are now moving against the third world as well and people
[55:08.840 --> 55:13.920]  better wake up and realize this is not my opinion and I want to tell the cops
[55:13.920 --> 55:18.240]  and the bureaucrats and the people out there the corporate minions the people
[55:18.240 --> 55:23.120]  that make up this power structure you have been actuary you have been assessed
[55:23.120 --> 55:27.480]  you've been compartmentalized you've been psychologically typed you are being
[55:27.480 --> 55:32.400]  basically maneuvered and put in by the engineers where they want you you are
[55:32.400 --> 55:37.560]  under attack you got that cop I mean if you have most cops if you smart mouth
[55:37.560 --> 55:41.280]  many way you're lucky if you don't go to the hospital but then the government
[55:41.280 --> 55:45.800]  can put poison in you and your children's water and you love it because
[55:45.800 --> 55:49.400]  you're trained to accept the big bosses hurting you you're trained to feel
[55:49.400 --> 55:54.240]  powerless you are on the same side as the American people whether you know it
[55:54.240 --> 56:00.760]  or not to these TSA workers well we know most TSA workers only work there for
[56:00.760 --> 56:04.360]  about a year they call them in they say you have a problem with the radiation
[56:04.360 --> 56:07.360]  machines you have a problem sticking your hands down people's pants if you say
[56:07.360 --> 56:14.440]  yes they pink slip you next pay period and so they're creating a group of TSA
[56:14.440 --> 56:19.320]  people that will do anything and when the TSA people try to say no we don't
[56:19.320 --> 56:24.760]  want to do this they're fired and so they end up only with either total idiots
[56:24.760 --> 56:29.640]  who don't understand what they're doing or very sadistic control freaks who
[56:29.640 --> 56:37.040]  like a job just grabbing got Jesse Ventura's genitals grabbing Ron Paul's
[56:37.040 --> 56:41.120]  crotch sticking their hands down people's pants doing this to little
[56:41.120 --> 56:50.480]  children I mean this is incredible and it's about getting rid of our modesty
[56:50.480 --> 56:53.880]  getting rid of our humanity why think the military all over the world not just
[56:53.880 --> 56:59.000]  here is trying for the last few decades to make men and women bunk together men
[56:59.000 --> 57:03.160]  and women use the same bathrooms so you're in there in the head sitting on
[57:03.160 --> 57:08.120]  the toilet right next to a woman you're in the shower with women they're trying
[57:08.120 --> 57:12.320]  to get rid of our basic humanity they're trying to totally re-engineer us and
[57:12.320 --> 57:16.680]  break down the natural order so that we can be socially engineered and they
[57:16.680 --> 57:21.200]  write countless textbooks and white papers for more than 150 years out of
[57:21.200 --> 57:26.320]  England about this social engineering to end the family as we know it and now
[57:26.320 --> 57:29.120]  all over the country they're saying we're not gonna allow homeschooling we
[57:29.120 --> 57:33.000]  say so your child belongs to us we're not gonna allow you to pack your child
[57:33.000 --> 57:39.040]  lunch period we're gonna train your child to report on you in English class
[57:39.040 --> 57:43.520]  on federally funded computers that are being downloaded about what goes on in
[57:43.520 --> 57:48.400]  your home life I was sent 13 years ago and it's in my film police state to the
[57:48.400 --> 57:56.160]  takeover the internal documents out of major cities around the country Kentucky
[57:56.160 --> 58:02.600]  and others where the ATF Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Farms and explosives has six
[58:02.600 --> 58:07.600]  month law enforcement classes in intermediate school sixth seventh grade
[58:07.600 --> 58:12.320]  that's their favorite time and we got the the curriculum it's all over the
[58:12.320 --> 58:16.280]  country and it's what's mommy and daddy doing guns are bad and they've got a
[58:16.280 --> 58:22.320]  local sheriff or cop who's a federal deputy in there and it says the officer
[58:22.320 --> 58:27.120]  will have access to the children during recess time and lunch and they're in
[58:27.120 --> 58:31.560]  there taking your kids away from you look at Explorer scouts New York Times
[58:31.560 --> 58:37.440]  trained to quote take on this grunt of veterans those 14 year olds that was four
[58:37.440 --> 58:46.280]  years ago they're now 18 they're ready to kill this is GCN the Genesis
[58:46.280 --> 58:52.520]  communications radio network this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you
[58:52.520 --> 58:56.400]  should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate
[58:56.400 --> 59:00.160]  legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our
[59:00.160 --> 59:04.080]  new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[59:04.080 --> 59:08.480]  you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[59:08.480 --> 59:12.920]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[59:12.920 --> 59:17.680]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[59:17.680 --> 59:21.480]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[59:21.480 --> 59:25.080]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[59:25.080 --> 59:29.440]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[59:29.440 --> 59:32.600]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[59:32.600 --> 59:36.280]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you
[59:36.280 --> 59:41.080]  can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's my solar
[59:41.080 --> 59:46.080]  backup.com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to mysolarbackup.com
[59:46.080 --> 59:51.560]  or call 1-877-327-0365
[59:52.840 --> 01:00:00.440]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:12.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:19.720]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:30.160]  Alex Jones our number two dr. Bob Bowman three degrees in nuclear physics will
[01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:33.880]  be joining us to cover the incredible developments of the admission that now
[01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:38.160]  the Fukushima disaster is as bad as Chernobyl he had expert guest on three
[01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:41.240]  weeks ago breaking that down like dr. Busby he'll be joining us for 30 minutes
[01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:44.920]  in the next hour I'm gonna open the phones up for the next 20 minutes but
[01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:48.440]  humor me we don't normally screen calls but you have to self screen yourself I
[01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:53.640]  only want to get your take on Chicago school districts and other school
[01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:59.840]  districts saying no sack lunches allowed no sack lunches allowed your
[01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:02.640]  parents cannot be trusted to pack your lunches they actually say that in the
[01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:07.480]  newspaper they actually say you the school basically owns your children and
[01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:13.600]  on top of that this new TSA video of a six-year-old and other scared children
[01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:17.560]  saying mommy I don't want to touch me you can hear that in the background with
[01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:22.000]  other kids getting real scared it's so painful to watch and they're just
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:26.560]  shutting down our transportation I want to get your view on this new video then
[01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:31.080]  they say now little girl I'm gonna lead you away for the drug test and again the
[01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:36.760]  TSA are experimental brainwashing centers now rolling out on the streets the
[01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:44.920]  toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231-800-259-9231 then we're
[01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:49.960]  gonna have open phones specifically on the radiation in the US the radiation
[01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:53.360]  from Fukushima the ongoing cover-up that they're now having to admit they were
[01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:57.040]  involved in a cover-up that's coming up Dr. Bob Bowman and then of course Dr.
[01:01:57.040 --> 01:02:03.120]  Christopher Busby the toll-free number to join us 800-259-9231 but I
[01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:10.920]  specifically want your take on what's happening with our school children the
[01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:16.560]  public school system was developed and set up in Europe in the United States
[01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:20.040]  with the express view and we've covered this at nauseam with the former head of
[01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:23.520]  policy Department of Education and her book that has all their internal
[01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:28.360]  documents it's designed to make the children unthinking regurgitating
[01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:32.960]  creatures who are basically spies of the state just like what China does and
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:39.520]  it's to destroy intelligence and and to destroy creativity and curiosity and
[01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:43.080]  that's why the numbers go down down down you know when the bankers bankrupt
[01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:46.480]  the economy and they make record bonuses and consolidate power it's going well
[01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:50.600]  they're not failing that's their plan when they bankrupt the system they want
[01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:55.360]  us to be servile when the cancer rates go up and the fertility level drops
[01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:59.560]  that's why they put the radioactive isotopes in the drinking water and
[01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:03.240]  you're so brain damaged and I'm so brain damaged we can't even get upset
[01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:06.640]  about it now cops listening right now are like well at least I got a uniform
[01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:09.800]  on a power trip I don't care if they're killing me you know this Alex Jones is
[01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:12.600]  a cook man you won't even look up the fact that I lay out all the documents
[01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:15.640]  you're on a power trip just like some low-level bureaucrat never seen a
[01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:19.280]  McDonald's manager somebody on a power trip with their employees it's the same
[01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:23.360]  thing the system can find mindless control freaks and if you're a good cop
[01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:27.200]  or a good teacher well you just don't get advanced this is a very dangerous
[01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:32.720]  system so when we come back I'm gonna take calls on the situation with the
[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:40.880]  schools and the grope downs that are going on at the airports and I want to
[01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:46.280]  hear from you on all of those fronts I also just want to remind listeners that

[01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:10.320]  because there's a war on for your mind
[01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:17.560]  okay dr. Bob Bowman nuclear physicist star wars program to join us to cover
[01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:20.720]  the incredible developments are now admitting what we told you three weeks
[01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:25.720]  ago Fukushima as bad as Chernobyl dr. Busby's gonna be joining us he said
[01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:29.720]  three weeks ago was worse than Chernobyl then the ongoing cover-up and
[01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:33.840]  increased radiation levels here in the US with the feds raising the safe level
[01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:39.720]  of radiation in a statistical clear manipulation part of this culture of
[01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:44.120]  lies but I want to take a round of calls right now I want to get to everybody
[01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:47.640]  so let's be quick because I want to hear from everyone about the fact that
[01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:51.000]  once we learned this was happening in Chicago we did some searches and found
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:55.280]  out in other parts of the country they send letters home with the parents
[01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:59.520]  saying what you're allowed to put in their lunch you know you will put a fruit
[01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:03.040]  you will put a vegetable you will put this type of sandwich in and now other
[01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:06.960]  school districts are just saying no lunches allowed period you must buy it
[01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:09.880]  from the company store from the government many schools you got a
[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:16.080]  thumbprint biometrically I mean just total control we now also have a new
[01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:19.920]  TSA video of a six-year-old girl and other children begging to not be searched
[01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:23.000]  in the background saying I'm scared I don't want to be searched and then they
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:26.160]  say come with me little girl after sticking their hand out her pants and
[01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:30.080]  groping her all over between her legs they lead her over for a quote drug test
[01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:33.240]  she's wearing a little tight shirt and little pants six-year-old clearly
[01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:36.280]  nothing hidden guilty until proven innocent being trained out to be a
[01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:41.040]  slave we're taking calls on this incredible conditioning that's going on
[01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:44.280]  and how these children and adults are being inducted into total slavery
[01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:48.560]  drudge headline TSA skill groping children again we posted the article
[01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:52.040]  yesterday drudge is carrying it today so glad drudge is in the fight against
[01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:57.960]  these monsters Justin in Missouri you're on the air welcome hey how you doing
[01:09:57.960 --> 01:10:02.720]  good I just wanted to point out that you guys have mentioned this before but the
[01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:07.960]  inevitability of gradualism I mean that they just take away and take away and
[01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:11.840]  I mean I noticed last year I went to a Christmas function at my son's school
[01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:15.800]  here in Missouri and they wouldn't mention the word Christmas it was a
[01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:21.360]  holiday festive event now they're they're taking our words away they're
[01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:24.760]  telling people they can get in trouble for what they say they're just they're
[01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:29.360]  totally rewriting our culture and it's just it and to me it's just another
[01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:33.360]  illustration of how asleep Americans still are I mean it you know they're
[01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:37.480]  coming right into your home right into your family now and I just don't know
[01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:41.440]  what it's gonna do Houston police chief has proposed again cameras and citizens
[01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:48.360]  homes in England oh with with 24,000 or 22,000 families when a new baby's born
[01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:52.080]  they put cameras in the house preemptively and then take them away if you
[01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:56.400]  do anything wrong and I hear a lot of people when you talk about this you
[01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:59.400]  just brought this to my mind about the camera thing it's a little off-subject
[01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:05.200]  but I happen to work for a repossession company and I drive a car around that has
[01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:09.520]  digital recognition software and cameras on it and so people laugh all the time
[01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:13.240]  when you talk about that but it does exist yeah so so so you have the
[01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:16.680]  software package that's been out for about 15 years that's hooked into most
[01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:20.960]  the highway cameras but the slaves aren't told that picks up license plates
[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:24.560]  that way you can go around looking for cars that are on the list
[01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:30.640]  530 miles an hour that's right it'll pick them up and it's just you know but
[01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:33.600]  but don't people just don't need to believe that this is only for that I
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:36.880]  mean they have it for facial recognition they have it for for for
[01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:40.640]  everything you can think of they now have an iPhone app that you can just walk
[01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:44.960]  around on the street videoing people and it'll pop up their names and who they
[01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:49.360]  are yeah yeah you're talking about that with the tattoo guy I think it was last
[01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:53.720]  week yeah that's just a tattoo now they have apps that actually scan faces but
[01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:57.320]  the question is where they get the database the databases from the DMV
[01:11:57.320 --> 01:12:01.880]  itself federalized oh yeah and that's another thing even if you're not up for
[01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:05.960]  for repossession six months from now you are well I've already got hits on where
[01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:12.720]  you are you know for from my historical hits and it builds a database tell folks
[01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:20.040]  how much did that software camera package cost it's around 14 5 in total with
[01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:25.200]  the server and the cameras yeah that's what I saw about 10 years ago it was over
[01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:29.440]  100 thou then it was 20 thou last number I saw was about 15 thou for the
[01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:35.760]  package I can buy the package yeah anybody can anybody can and then you
[01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:40.320]  know but like I said that that's not really what I do with it isn't really
[01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:45.320]  you know gonna cause any trouble but but the point is the software can be used
[01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:49.520]  for other things well let me expand on that I've got a friend who's out of the
[01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:53.200]  system is a Christian believes it's the whole mark of the beast and it clearly
[01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:56.040]  is even we all believe in the devil it might as well be the devil running it
[01:12:56.040 --> 01:13:00.440]  that's the intent it's pure evil he got sick of it and he got sick of the fact
[01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:04.880]  that the illegal aliens the APD have these cars they don't really tell the
[01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:08.400]  slaves that but a lot of their cars have it now he just slapped Mexican plates on
[01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:12.840]  and he's like God now doesn't get pulled over gets totally left alone and they
[01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:16.880]  literally just fall down and worship him because he's got Mexican plates
[01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:21.240]  oh absolutely I mean that that's because you can't buck the system and that's
[01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:25.760]  not what that's not what they want it used for they want to use for us well
[01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:29.720]  exactly I mean you get your car stolen the cops won't even come out and I've
[01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:32.400]  seen these cop shows where they're driving around with it oh that's a stolen
[01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:36.320]  car that's a stolen car and and then they let the violent offenders go but
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:41.120]  then keep the nonviolent just in great point anything else you want to add no
[01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:48.800]  that's it thanks thank you sir it's it's it's just beyond insane they're paying
[01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:52.560]  thousands of Austinites to have a satellite tracker box in their car the
[01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:56.160]  feds are just where I live it's all over the country and they get a insurance
[01:13:56.160 --> 01:14:00.080]  discount and the feds pay him I think it's $600 a year last time I saw the
[01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:03.280]  numbers to put the satellite tracker in and the department's transportation
[01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:06.920]  admits that they plan to have this in all cars soon and you tell a yuppie this
[01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:11.560]  and they just laugh at you hey there's uranium in your tap water they added hey
[01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:18.480]  those cameras are face scanning you hey they put steroids in vaccines they got
[01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:23.520]  ground troops getting ready to go into Libya let's talk to Jordan in Texas
[01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:29.160]  Jordan you're on the air yeah it's good to talk to you finally I was gonna say
[01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:32.600]  you brought up the whole homeschooling thing and of course it just hit me you
[01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:36.680]  know I was homeschooled I went to public school up to about sixth grade and you
[01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:39.640]  know I'm not ashamed to admit that I didn't graduate high school but none of
[01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:42.240]  my friends they did graduate high school and some of which are in the
[01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:47.720]  military know nothing about Hitler concentration camps Constitution JFK
[01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:53.840]  none of it and there are like 20 21 23 none of them and of course I'm you know
[01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:57.600]  last grade I was in was wrong you know about six or seventh and yet I know
[01:14:57.600 --> 01:15:01.840]  plenty of about it so it just shows you where our country is going when our
[01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:04.960]  military doesn't even teach the main about the Constitution because my
[01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:07.640]  friends don't even know anything about that well anyone that puts their child
[01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:11.320]  in in public school needs to have their head examined and I understand the way
[01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:14.200]  the economy is and they already take your property tax to pay for it a lot
[01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:17.680]  people don't have the money to put them in private school or homeschool them but
[01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:22.520]  I mean I can't believe that I was in public school I mean it was fighting
[01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:28.880]  sex total peer pressure it was hellish I mean I was having a good time but in
[01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:35.480]  hindsight I mean all that TV culture all that corruption it is just there in
[01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:39.640]  those schools and you learn how to love Nike tennis shoes and how to try to
[01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:43.360]  dress cool and and everybody's trying to compete with each other to be more
[01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:47.840]  adult and you don't get your parents values you get the systems values and
[01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:51.440]  look at America falling apart well that's all they care about they care about
[01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:55.240]  what you look like what your if you got tattoos or what your color hair is they
[01:15:55.240 --> 01:15:58.600]  care more about that than what you're learning and they don't teach you
[01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:02.000]  anything anyway do my friends don't know anything and yet of course I like I
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:05.320]  said nothing about the Constitution I thought history and it really just
[01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:09.600]  upset me and frankly just pisses me off well Jordan Jordan I appreciate your
[01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:12.880]  call but you know statistically almost every international spelling bee
[01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:17.640]  champion geography bee champion they're always homeschoolers and big fortune
[01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:23.320]  100 headhunt homeschoolers because they can think on their own and they and they
[01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:27.240]  hire them and put them through college so the system knows what they're doing
[01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:32.880]  Sean in New York you're on the air go ahead yeah hi Alex can you hear me yes
[01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:37.040]  sir yeah Alex you know you were talking about the police state and being
[01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:41.880]  guilty until provenance innocent I'm out here in Suffolk County in New York and
[01:16:41.880 --> 01:16:47.800]  we're seeing a record number of parents committing suicide murder suicides and
[01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:54.400]  it's based upon they're losing their children left and right CPS ACS family
[01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:59.440]  court they're more or less just taking their children and making them fight and
[01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:03.200]  try to gain it later on well you know nine times out of ten I'll hear an
[01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:07.360]  alert on the radio locally a child was kidnapped today a child was kidnapped
[01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:10.360]  today and then I'll go look up the news they won't even tell you till the next
[01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:15.160]  day that it was the father and the mother and that CPS says that they might
[01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:18.440]  be abusing him and these aren't real courts there's not due process and the
[01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:22.320]  parents run and they put it on the news there's been a kidnapping and then
[01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:25.680]  meanwhile you're five times more likely the Department of Justice even admits to
[01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:31.040]  be abused in government hands than any other place the government is the
[01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:35.160]  greater of any evil and they've set it up where they have no liability remember
[01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:38.600]  a few years ago I played that news clip out of Arkansas we're in one week two
[01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:43.640]  kids in one town died in foster care and the head of foster that they have the
[01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:48.120]  CPS went on the air and said children will die that's just the way it is
[01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:52.440]  children will die if that guy searched the video on YouTube CPS head says
[01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:57.000]  children will die and he's like children will die but yes I see these
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:01.480]  reports of the suicides increasing society falling apart as they turn the
[01:18:01.480 --> 01:18:06.000]  resources off as it's impossible for people to make it and the system just
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:11.280]  loves it they just it's working well I definitely appreciate you taking the
[01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:15.120]  time to hear it you know the one thing that people don't realize is that all
[01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:19.720]  of these officials and people doing this they all have judicial immunity and
[01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:24.400]  there's no accountability so basically you're on your own and if you try to go
[01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:30.440]  get help senators congressmen nobody nobody really cares the Supreme Court
[01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:35.400]  just ruled that prosecutors are allowed to frame you know you're innocent and
[01:18:35.400 --> 01:18:40.680]  lie to put you in prison they are openly saying we are pure evil we are pure
[01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:45.880]  evil and now you can't make your child a lunch you're not allowed slave they
[01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:50.840]  are they are destroying everything of course they are I mean we've they told
[01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:56.640]  us it's good to kill 51 million babies in America since 73 I mean it's just the
[01:18:56.640 --> 01:19:00.440]  government is pure evil and people better grow up and realize that we're in
[01:19:00.440 --> 01:19:06.320]  great danger well that's out I appreciate you having me on thank you I
[01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:11.400]  appreciate your call and folks this isn't just some I want to bash government we
[01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:16.120]  we better relearn what the founding fathers said we better rediscover
[01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:20.560]  history and what happens to societies do you understand the globalists want a
[01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:23.800]  depression while they tell you everything's great they want to destroy
[01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:28.440]  society while denying it's happening so they can continue to basically rape and
[01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:34.880]  rob us and get away with it I mean this is not a joke they're openly merging
[01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:39.400]  Canada and Mexico with the US right now publicly it's in major newspapers that
[01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:43.560]  oh we're gonna have foreign troops in America to suppress Americans just
[01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:49.600]  incredible things are happening on a daily basis that are just off the charts

[01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:09.160]  rate is now 22% and not 9 like what we are told by the mainstream media the
[01:21:09.160 --> 01:21:13.120]  primary instinct of unemployed Americans is to go to college and seek a higher
[01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:17.080]  education but all across America students are graduating with hundreds of
[01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:21.240]  thousands of dollars in debt and no jobs most college graduates are now
[01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:24.680]  admitting that they would have been better off getting a job at Walmart or
[01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:28.560]  McDonald's than having their lives destroyed by student loans our friends

[01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:43.360]  a short segment for the rest of the hour dr. Bob Bowman is our guest after he
[01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:47.040]  leaves us will continue with some more calls we have dr. Busby joining us a
[01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:51.800]  chemical physicist one of the top advisors over in England on radiation
[01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:56.280]  hazards and poisoning dr. Busby said here over three weeks ago that he believed
[01:24:56.280 --> 01:25:00.080]  it was already worse than Chernobyl that multiple containment facilities had
[01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:02.880]  been breached with the intel he had because he has a lot of people in the
[01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:07.520]  international atomic energy agency is contacts and since then that's been
[01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:11.840]  confirmed the New York Times confirmed that fuel rods when number three blew up
[01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:15.600]  stored on top were shot over a mile away the Japanese just buried them with
[01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:21.560]  bulldozers 7.5 million safe times radiation plutonium uranium going into
[01:25:21.560 --> 01:25:25.880]  the ocean still off-gassing more earthquakes they say complete meltdowns
[01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:30.560]  could happen one reactors had a 70% meltdown and oozed out of a crack in the
[01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:35.160]  breached wall and now the Japanese are saying this is from a scale of one to
[01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:41.680]  seven it's a seven as bad as it gets on par with Chernobyl and that's with the
[01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:45.400]  ongoing cover-up with the governor of the prefecture Fukushima saying there's a
[01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:49.560]  cover-up and people going to the hospital with radiation sickness so I'm
[01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:52.080]  just setting the table here we'll go through these questions with dr. Bob
[01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:57.840]  Bowman also the EPA is quietly raising safe radiation levels from between a
[01:25:57.840 --> 01:26:05.840]  thousand to 25,000 depending on what isotope it is and 17 states are
[01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:13.760]  reporting 300 times safe levels of radioactive iodine and other radioactive
[01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:19.160]  isotopes so we're going to be going over all of that with dr. Bob
[01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:26.800]  Bowman dr. Bob Bowman of course has the website thepatriots.us he of course
[01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:34.120]  flew 101 combat missions in Vietnam bombing missions he of course was the
[01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:38.080]  former head of the Star Wars weapons program and he has three degrees in
[01:26:38.080 --> 01:26:43.960]  nuclear physics and aeronautics doesn't need any you know real introduction
[01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:46.840]  past the fact that he's also awarded the Society of American Military
[01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:52.040]  Engineers ROTC Medal of Merit it just goes on and on of course has air metal
[01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:57.080]  with five oak leaf clusters meritorious service metal but the big issue is that
[01:26:57.080 --> 01:27:00.840]  he's a nuclear physicist headed up the secret Star Wars program doctor good to
[01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:05.760]  have you here I know we tried to air on the safe side a month ago but looks like
[01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:12.720]  this thing is an ongoing crisis yes Alex it's pretty much what I predicted at
[01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:20.360]  that time I said that it looked like it was going to be worse than Chernobyl and
[01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:28.640]  it is and I think it has been for weeks this level five for the last several
[01:27:28.640 --> 01:27:34.760]  weeks has been plain ridiculous they've been saying level five for three weeks
[01:27:34.760 --> 01:27:41.800]  now they admit a cover-up and seven point five million normal levels and
[01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:45.160]  that itself they're reporting is probably a cover-up Russia today has got
[01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:48.880]  detectors out there and saying they're just pegged off the chart what does this
[01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:55.360]  look like to you well it looks to me like the people in a large area of
[01:27:55.360 --> 01:28:05.600]  Japan are in serious trouble and the Japanese government had better admit
[01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:14.480]  that warn the people evacuate them help them move whatever from inside their
[01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:20.520]  houses is not contaminated already clean up the people from the radiation on
[01:28:20.520 --> 01:28:27.160]  their skin and you know let them start a new life
[01:28:27.160 --> 01:28:37.320]  considerably west southwest probably of the radiation area now what about and
[01:28:37.320 --> 01:28:42.040]  I want to go over some of these numbers 17 states are reporting first it was a
[01:28:42.040 --> 01:28:48.120]  hundred eighty one times safe levels in the water in Berkeley now they're
[01:28:48.120 --> 01:28:54.000]  reporting in milk 300 times and they're listing the different isotopes radioactive
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:59.120]  nickel cesium cesium I mean this what do you think of the EPA saying they're
[01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:05.920]  gonna raise what they say the safe levels are well first the question is are
[01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:13.080]  these people saying it's 300 times the safe level or 300 times the normal level
[01:29:13.080 --> 01:29:19.880]  the news is saying both so technically fellow sin well there's a huge
[01:29:19.880 --> 01:29:33.240]  difference because the safe level is probably a hundred thousand times the
[01:29:33.240 --> 01:29:40.240]  normal level that we're exposed to just because we're living here in the United
[01:29:40.240 --> 01:29:46.360]  States where the normal level we get from all sources is about one and a half
[01:29:46.360 --> 01:29:52.480]  times stay there stay there we got a break got a break we're on the March the
[01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:59.640]  Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:06.040]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[01:30:06.040 --> 01:30:11.400]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that
[01:30:11.400 --> 01:30:14.840]  they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home after
[01:30:14.840 --> 01:30:19.640]  an innocent influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling
[01:30:19.640 --> 01:30:24.920]  the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:29.480]  attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[01:30:29.480 --> 01:30:34.160]  offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[01:30:34.160 --> 01:30:38.200]  constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're
[01:30:38.200 --> 01:30:41.880]  asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to
[01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:46.640]  today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have
[01:30:46.640 --> 01:30:52.560]  seen a fall of the Republic get your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at
[01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:57.600]  info wars dot com we're watching online right now in super high quality at
[01:30:57.600 --> 01:31:02.720]  prison planet dot TV this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[01:31:02.720 --> 01:31:07.160]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[01:31:07.160 --> 01:31:11.200]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[01:31:11.200 --> 01:31:15.120]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[01:31:15.120 --> 01:31:19.120]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[01:31:19.120 --> 01:31:23.680]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[01:31:23.680 --> 01:31:27.720]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[01:31:27.720 --> 01:31:31.520]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:35.120]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[01:31:35.120 --> 01:31:39.480]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[01:31:39.480 --> 01:31:42.600]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[01:31:42.600 --> 01:31:46.280]  generators offered by solution from science one of my oldest sponsors you
[01:31:46.280 --> 01:31:51.840]  can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com
[01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:56.600]  remember the government doesn't own the son so go to mysolarbackup.com or call
[01:31:56.600 --> 01:32:04.440]  1-877-327-0365 a very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011 we
[01:32:04.440 --> 01:32:08.760]  will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years he says
[01:32:08.760 --> 01:32:12.480]  it will change everything about our lives the way you shop travel invest
[01:32:12.480 --> 01:32:15.720]  educate your children and even how you take care of your health and your own
[01:32:15.720 --> 01:32:19.080]  family now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years
[01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:23.840]  the crazy part is he's usually right you see he predicted the collapse of GM
[01:32:23.840 --> 01:32:27.120]  Panny May, Freddie Mac and America's biggest mall owner general growth
[01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:31.960]  properties in fact Barron's called his work a dire prophecy recently he
[01:32:31.960 --> 01:32:35.600]  created a video which you can watch online for free detailing his biggest and
[01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:39.560]  most important prediction yet and it's a real eye-opener I can't stress this
[01:32:39.560 --> 01:32:43.200]  enough you should at least watch this free video online today he explains
[01:32:43.200 --> 01:32:46.360]  everything you need to know including simple steps you can take to protect
[01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:52.080]  yourself you can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com that's end of

[01:33:05.560 --> 01:33:14.840]  Jones Monday through Friday 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. central back Sundays 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:33:14.840 --> 01:33:19.080]  Dr. Bob Bowman nuclear physicist is our guest you got interrupted by the break
[01:33:19.080 --> 01:33:26.600]  sorry about that reporting here from the EPA's own website they are reporting
[01:33:26.600 --> 01:33:31.080]  that they are going to raise the new standards nearly 1,000 fold for exposure
[01:33:31.080 --> 01:33:36.600]  to strontium 90 3,000 to 100,000 fold hike for exposure to iodine 1 3 1 and
[01:33:36.600 --> 01:33:44.200]  almost 25,000 rise for exposure to radioactive nickel 63 and they are
[01:33:44.200 --> 01:33:52.360]  reporting 300 times 300 times higher levels is all they say they don't say
[01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:59.240]  normal or say they just say higher levels in 17 states that have done the
[01:33:59.240 --> 01:34:04.160]  test and the feds aren't even releasing numbers these are universities and
[01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:08.920]  state groups from Washington to California from Pennsylvania to New
[01:34:08.920 --> 01:34:16.320]  York from Alabama to Ohio but you were explaining there that the U.S. already
[01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:25.400]  has a certain radiation level background please continue yeah the background
[01:34:25.400 --> 01:34:32.160]  radiation in the United States is about one and a half times the average in the
[01:34:32.160 --> 01:34:38.840]  rest of the world it's twice what it is in in Australia and that radiation is
[01:34:38.840 --> 01:34:50.640]  about three milli sieverts a year in the United States now the threshold for
[01:34:50.640 --> 01:34:57.640]  known carcinogenic effects in other words giving you cancer is about a hundred
[01:34:57.640 --> 01:35:10.160]  milli sieverts a year for radiation sickness the threshold is much higher
[01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:19.640]  than that it's about one to three sieverts a year so what a thousand to
[01:35:19.640 --> 01:35:29.200]  three thousand milli sieverts a year to start getting no I'm sorry that's in one
[01:35:29.200 --> 01:35:40.520]  day so the the yearly dose would have to be you know 360 times that so about a
[01:35:40.520 --> 01:35:54.080]  thousand sieverts a year rate is what gives you instant radiation sickness so
[01:35:54.080 --> 01:35:59.440]  that there's so many different thresholds you sort of have to understand
[01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:06.920]  them the bottom line is that we have to be careful here in the United States
[01:36:06.920 --> 01:36:12.400]  about food supply particularly about anything that comes from Japan it could
[01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:18.800]  be in our fish it could get into the food chain in the United States because of
[01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:27.680]  fallout on the grass which is eaten by cows and other animals that is a form
[01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:34.600]  of radiation that got into the food supply in Europe after Chernobyl but
[01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:40.960]  of course those areas of Europe Finland and whatnot were much closer to Chernobyl
[01:36:40.960 --> 01:36:49.400]  than we are to Fukushima so there'll be a lot less of that here in the United
[01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:55.360]  States there will be some fallout and there will be some people in the United
[01:36:55.360 --> 01:37:01.080]  States getting cancer you won't be able to tell which cancers came from this
[01:37:01.080 --> 01:37:08.640]  radiation and which are from some other source unless there's a particular kind
[01:37:08.640 --> 01:37:14.720]  of cancer and unfortunately there's not a particular kind of cancer that
[01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:24.120]  identifies itself and says aha that's by golly from radioactive fallout you can
[01:37:24.120 --> 01:37:27.800]  get all sorts of different cancers including the same kind of cancers that
[01:37:27.800 --> 01:37:43.520]  you get from your normal exposure and by the way smokers get some 30,000 times as
[01:37:43.520 --> 01:37:52.880]  much radiation as someone who lives next door to a nuclear power plant so
[01:37:52.880 --> 01:37:58.720]  explain that because there's there's isotopes in the tobacco
[01:37:58.720 --> 01:38:10.680]  yeah the there there are radioactive isotopes in just about everything
[01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:16.280]  including in the human body you actually get a certain dose from sleeping next to
[01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:25.800]  another person you get a small dose from eating a banana when you add up all the
[01:38:25.800 --> 01:38:29.760]  normal things including the background radiation the radiation from the soil
[01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:40.840]  from the sky and all the rest of it then you get your normal total background
[01:38:40.840 --> 01:38:48.920]  radiation which a normal person gets which is about three millisieverts per
[01:38:48.920 --> 01:38:55.560]  year and so that's what's considered sort of normal and these figures they're
[01:38:55.560 --> 01:39:02.080]  coming out that that say 300 times normal my guess is that they're talking
[01:39:02.080 --> 01:39:09.360]  about 300 times that number which is still considerably less than a smoker
[01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:18.560]  gets or and orders of magnitude too small to give anyone radiation sickness
[01:39:18.560 --> 01:39:30.920]  you see these cancers that you get can come with a fairly small dose and the
[01:39:30.920 --> 01:39:36.200]  cancer rate in this country will increase imperceptibly probably you
[01:39:36.200 --> 01:39:43.320]  probably won't see it show up in the statistics but there will probably be a
[01:39:43.320 --> 01:39:52.720]  few thousand unlucky people who just happened to breathe in a piece of
[01:39:52.720 --> 01:39:59.680]  radioactive plutonium that fell out of the jet stream and they happen to breathe
[01:39:59.680 --> 01:40:04.680]  it into their lungs and it gets stuck there and it causes cancer yeah so to
[01:40:04.680 --> 01:40:07.840]  explain you have the general background but that's what dr. Christopher
[01:40:07.840 --> 01:40:12.880]  Busby has said as well but then there's the actual particles that just added the
[01:40:12.880 --> 01:40:16.240]  overall background but if you are to inhale one of those that's many times
[01:40:16.240 --> 01:40:19.160]  more radioactive than just the background and then it sits there in your
[01:40:19.160 --> 01:40:22.960]  lungs that's what's really going to get you and and we've got him coming on for
[01:40:22.960 --> 01:40:28.720]  30 minutes in the next hour dr. Busby who reportedly was the advisor to the
[01:40:28.720 --> 01:40:33.200]  BBC and others who's an expert specifically on radiation poisoning he
[01:40:33.200 --> 01:40:38.040]  says that the general low levels that they already say are safe and no big
[01:40:38.040 --> 01:40:44.520]  deal he's saying even those are reduced levels that they're lying lying by what
[01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:48.200]  they say is safe and so now as they say well we're raising the level but that's
[01:40:48.200 --> 01:40:54.120]  still safe he's saying that itself is a deception he says that the radiation is
[01:40:54.120 --> 01:41:02.520]  contributing to the sperm count dropping into infertility absolutely there is no
[01:41:02.520 --> 01:41:11.040]  really safe level radiation even just the the background radiation that we all
[01:41:11.040 --> 01:41:25.560]  get every day if it gets you in the right place it can cause cancer and because of
[01:41:25.560 --> 01:41:36.200]  that there's really no safe level and but on the other hand the level for
[01:41:36.200 --> 01:41:42.760]  getting radiation sickness is so much higher that nobody in this country needs
[01:41:42.760 --> 01:41:51.720]  to worry about that unless you get a fish right out of the waters off Fukushima
[01:41:51.720 --> 01:41:58.920]  and you eat it and and get a massive dose inside your body so we're not
[01:41:58.920 --> 01:42:02.720]  talking about a fast kill we're talking about just adding to the overall
[01:42:02.720 --> 01:42:09.480]  morbidity numbers of the population dr. Bowman absolutely and we're we've
[01:42:09.480 --> 01:42:14.080]  already had some of that from Chernobyl because the effects of Chernobyl went
[01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:22.080]  around the world the radiation levels increased here in the United States we
[01:42:22.080 --> 01:42:26.440]  could detect that they're going to be higher this time from Fukushima
[01:42:26.440 --> 01:42:33.360]  considerably higher but not enough to make anyone sick but certainly enough
[01:42:33.360 --> 01:42:38.760]  that there will be a lot of people get cancer and never know that it came from
[01:42:38.760 --> 01:42:43.280]  radiation okay let's expand on that well why does Australia have half the
[01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:46.680]  background radiation that the United States does is that because of all the
[01:42:46.680 --> 01:42:55.120]  nuclear above-ground testing that went on there may be some of that but I think
[01:42:55.120 --> 01:43:03.720]  after a period of time the mixing of the atmosphere is such that the the fallout
[01:43:03.720 --> 01:43:10.800]  but from that is now pretty evenly spread but there's no question that the
[01:43:10.800 --> 01:43:19.720]  fallout from atmospheric testing and from Chernobyl fell out into the earth
[01:43:19.720 --> 01:43:24.120]  and the grass of the northern hemisphere a lot more than it did the
[01:43:24.120 --> 01:43:29.160]  southern hemisphere oh yeah let me also Chernobyl is the main issue and within a
[01:43:29.160 --> 01:43:35.360]  month it had circled the globe according to detectors in 1986 what do you
[01:43:35.360 --> 01:43:40.600]  think of an culture statement but on the right but also on the left the big one
[01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:45.440]  worlder George Monbiot for the London Guardian saying he now is for nuclear
[01:43:45.440 --> 01:43:49.120]  power because of the disaster a very bizarre orwellian statement she said
[01:43:49.120 --> 01:43:53.920]  the Japanese ought to be thankful that this radiation will now make sure quote
[01:43:53.920 --> 01:43:57.960]  that they don't get cancer which is an acid ion statement obviously they you
[01:43:57.960 --> 01:44:01.200]  know they can use neutron beam and other things to fry a certain cancer then
[01:44:01.200 --> 01:44:04.960]  that damages surrounding tissue once you have a cancer because it kills the
[01:44:04.960 --> 01:44:09.640]  cells but this is a general damaging of the DNA and the cells so I guess I'm
[01:44:09.640 --> 01:44:12.600]  answering the question for you but why do you think they're making these bizarre
[01:44:12.600 --> 01:44:18.320]  statements about how the Japanese should be thankful well and culture I think is
[01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:26.040]  just plain ridiculous I thought that for a long time and these latest
[01:44:26.040 --> 01:44:31.720]  statements about little radiation is good for you is just another confirmation
[01:44:31.720 --> 01:44:37.840]  of how off the wall she is along with a lot of other people out there but why
[01:44:37.840 --> 01:44:45.760]  I mean they can't be that stupid is this just a throwing it in our face no I I
[01:44:45.760 --> 01:44:50.760]  really think it's you know taking a little bit of misinformation and
[01:44:50.760 --> 01:45:01.000]  misconstruing it and I really think it is stupidity I really don't see any
[01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:09.040]  reason why a person who knows better would say something like that have
[01:45:09.040 --> 01:45:16.240]  anything to gain from it whatsoever it is discrediting ABC News is reporting
[01:45:16.240 --> 01:45:21.960]  that the semi-valley nuclear meltdown still impacts lives that happened in 59
[01:45:21.960 --> 01:45:25.760]  that kept its secret for decades and they say that's the second biggest
[01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:30.760]  nuclear disaster after Chernobyl I guess soon it's going to be eclipsed now
[01:45:30.760 --> 01:45:35.480]  by Fukushima but they kept that secret that was the first operational power
[01:45:35.480 --> 01:45:41.000]  based power supplying reactor they say in the US and I know you've worked all
[01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:46.240]  over the US in the in the in the Star Wars program this really is a segue
[01:45:46.240 --> 01:45:51.400]  into the politics of this and the nuclear industry basically getting behind a
[01:45:51.400 --> 01:45:57.320]  program of putting a psychological salve on this whitewashing it telling us
[01:45:57.320 --> 01:46:01.280]  everything's fine what do you think should come out of this Fukushima
[01:46:01.280 --> 01:46:05.760]  disaster a but b what do you think's going to come out of it well what should
[01:46:05.760 --> 01:46:10.120]  come out of it is that we can't just shut down all the nuclear power plants
[01:46:10.120 --> 01:46:16.440]  because you know we're pregnant on nuclear electricity and we've got to live
[01:46:16.440 --> 01:46:22.760]  with it for now but we ought to shut down one nuclear power plant at a time
[01:46:22.760 --> 01:46:32.000]  and replace it with a modern nuclear power plant that is much safer like a
[01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:39.000]  thorium molten salt reactor there are designs of reactors that are self
[01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:48.200]  quenching you don't have to have an emergency water supply the the stuff
[01:46:48.200 --> 01:46:52.360]  will go out on its own but it shows that the system we have 23 of these
[01:46:52.360 --> 01:46:57.160]  mark one plutonium g reactors that are close to 40 years old just like Japan
[01:46:57.160 --> 01:47:01.280]  they have no intention of shutting them down and then we can't spend any of the
[01:47:01.280 --> 01:47:05.800]  money to build these because everything's got to go to banker bailouts
[01:47:05.800 --> 01:47:13.840]  yeah right exactly and you know if we had somebody in the government with some
[01:47:13.840 --> 01:47:21.280]  guts they'd say okay we shut down this one I'd pick Indian point first because
[01:47:21.280 --> 01:47:28.960]  it's so close to New York City shut it down one reactor the SLR time replace it
[01:47:28.960 --> 01:47:35.640]  with a modern one that can give us the the power safer and cheaper and with
[01:47:35.640 --> 01:47:42.080]  less waste coming out of it and all of that and then go to the next one maybe a
[01:47:42.080 --> 01:47:49.240]  Salon O'Ferry or Diablo Canyon and one at a time replace these things and then
[01:47:49.240 --> 01:47:55.760]  the ones along the New Madrid fault in the middle of the country and this would
[01:47:55.760 --> 01:48:01.640]  create jobs which we need in a recession you know everybody is talking
[01:48:01.640 --> 01:48:07.360]  about you got a cut spending well that's exactly the wrong thing to do in a
[01:48:07.360 --> 01:48:18.400]  recession or a depression the government has to spend money to his Skype video
[01:48:18.400 --> 01:48:22.680]  from Florida just froze we're gonna get him back on my issue is if they have
[01:48:22.680 --> 01:48:26.880]  37 billion 40 billion they're arguing about what the real numbers are and it
[01:48:26.880 --> 01:48:30.520]  turns out it was highway building projects that's the last thing you cut
[01:48:30.520 --> 01:48:35.280]  oh but we've got the trillions and trillions a month that are going to
[01:48:35.280 --> 01:48:38.440]  the offshore secret banks you know give them the trillions and the
[01:48:38.440 --> 01:48:42.680]  Republicans oh don't touch the bankers trillions Obama don't touch the bankers
[01:48:42.680 --> 01:48:47.800]  trillions in derivatives we're having to pay for that we don't know let's kick
[01:48:47.800 --> 01:48:52.120]  people off food stamps in an imploding economy all that's going to create is
[01:48:52.120 --> 01:48:56.520]  civil unrest and dr. Bowman do you agree that they're scapegoating people that
[01:48:56.520 --> 01:48:59.440]  are the poorest Americans and claiming they're the reason we're having
[01:48:59.440 --> 01:49:04.080]  economic problems when it doesn't even enter the equation absolutely you bet
[01:49:04.080 --> 01:49:12.680]  and what should happen again is abolish the Federal Reserve audit all the big
[01:49:12.680 --> 01:49:19.240]  banks and those who are insolvent should be nationalized and then they can loan
[01:49:19.240 --> 01:49:28.720]  money at very low interest rates and get the economy working again you know the
[01:49:28.720 --> 01:49:36.560]  the Rothschilds the global banking empires that's as much a reason why
[01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:42.080]  we're in these stupid wars as the oil because the countries were going after
[01:49:42.080 --> 01:49:48.880]  Iraq and Afghanistan and Libya and you know Venezuela all those countries that
[01:49:48.880 --> 01:49:59.960]  we label as enemies are countries that do not belong to the global federal bank
[01:49:59.960 --> 01:50:04.240]  system they're not dependent on the Rothschilds and the IMF and the World
[01:50:04.240 --> 01:50:11.760]  Bank they have their own money their own bank and they can thumb their nose I
[01:50:11.760 --> 01:50:19.000]  mean that's what Gaddafi was doing he used his own money to do enormous
[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:25.520]  public works programs bringing water from aquifers under the desert to the
[01:50:25.520 --> 01:50:33.560]  cities making the desert bloom huge projects not ever borrowing a dime from
[01:50:33.560 --> 01:50:37.440]  the global bankers and of course the global bankers don't like that and the
[01:50:37.440 --> 01:50:41.040]  first thing they did once they took over the east was set up a new central bank
[01:50:41.040 --> 01:50:45.000]  and oil company and they've got al-Qaeda as the good guys down if you don't like
[01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:48.440]  al-Qaeda you're an American but I know dr. Bob Bowman then I guess you're an
[01:50:48.440 --> 01:50:51.800]  American because I know you don't like al-Qaeda we'll talk about al-CIA to when
[01:50:51.800 --> 01:50:56.040]  we come back with dr. Bob Bowman on the other side the patriots dot us is his
[01:50:56.040 --> 01:51:00.280]  website our websites info wars com stay with us
[01:51:00.160 --> 01:51:04.440]  hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are now storing
[01:51:04.440 --> 01:51:08.160]  non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you
[01:51:08.160 --> 01:51:11.720]  know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than
[01:51:11.720 --> 01:51:15.480]  silver or gold it's true seeds that all perform even gold and silver before in
[01:51:15.480 --> 01:51:19.360]  this country and it's possible that could even happen again so our friends and
[01:51:19.360 --> 01:51:23.800]  solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they
[01:51:23.800 --> 01:51:28.840]  call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient
[01:51:28.840 --> 01:51:32.560]  dense food for you and your family and here's the best part these seeds have
[01:51:32.560 --> 01:51:36.360]  not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to
[01:51:36.360 --> 01:51:40.880]  plant a full acre crisis garden so visit them today at survival seed bank
[01:51:40.880 --> 01:51:47.920]  dot com that's survival seed bank dot com or give them a call at 877-327-0365
[01:51:47.920 --> 01:51:56.280]  that's 877-327-0365 remember in a real crisis non-hybrid seeds are the
[01:51:56.280 --> 01:52:00.840]  ultimate barter item this is Alex Jones for survival seed bank dot com dr.
[01:52:00.840 --> 01:52:05.440]  David Berry has provided excellent advice for all those interested in practical
[01:52:05.440 --> 01:52:09.320]  economics and sound money it's certainly worth reading that's what
[01:52:09.320 --> 01:52:13.900]  congressman Ron Paul said about cha-ching wisdom 123 practical universal
[01:52:13.900 --> 01:52:18.040]  truths about money the new book by dr. David Berry the cool part of this book
[01:52:18.040 --> 01:52:21.480]  certainly it'll speak to you personally your life your lifestyle your your money
[01:52:21.480 --> 01:52:25.200]  your investments but it also can be generalized into the nation what's
[01:52:25.200 --> 01:52:28.160]  going on as a nation we do these same things as personally that we do as a
[01:52:28.160 --> 01:52:32.200]  nation dr. Berry's book to Ching wisdom presents many facets of your
[01:52:32.200 --> 01:52:36.040]  relationship with the once-almighty dollar and how current national and
[01:52:36.040 --> 01:52:39.760]  international politics affect your daily life some of the other things are
[01:52:39.760 --> 01:52:43.200]  about that they're not just economic they're philosophical there's

[01:54:18.680 --> 01:54:21.880]  another five minutes then the next five minutes I'll get to some of these
[01:54:21.880 --> 01:54:24.560]  callers that have been holding the dr. Busby's on for about 30 minutes that
[01:54:24.560 --> 01:54:29.720]  will continue with calls and other news on the economy dr. Bob Bowman you know
[01:54:29.720 --> 01:54:34.000]  we tell people I mean the history of al-Qaeda being global is created being
[01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:39.320]  used against the Serbs the Russians before that now the commander of the
[01:54:39.320 --> 01:54:43.720]  rebels is admittedly al-Qaeda was held in a black site and I guess reeducated and
[01:54:43.720 --> 01:54:48.560]  then admits he sent al-Qaeda fighters to Iraq to kill US troops and they
[01:54:48.560 --> 01:54:53.520]  just openly say yeah that you know the core of these people is al-Qaeda and you
[01:54:53.520 --> 01:54:56.840]  talk about economics every country that doesn't allow a global essential bank
[01:54:56.840 --> 01:55:00.880]  like Serbia whether they're good bad or indifferent the point is they don't want
[01:55:00.880 --> 01:55:05.440]  any independent sovereign nations out there and what's your view dealing with
[01:55:05.440 --> 01:55:11.080]  9-11 and that inside job as a military man as an American patriot and the fact
[01:55:11.080 --> 01:55:14.480]  that they think we're so stupid now that they're admitting Amar al-Alaqi the
[01:55:14.480 --> 01:55:18.600]  number one operative commander under bin Laden is secretly hanging out the
[01:55:18.600 --> 01:55:23.160]  Pentagon it comes out in AP Fox News nobody gets in trouble I mean this is
[01:55:23.160 --> 01:55:30.680]  getting more and more naked isn't it yeah it's ridiculous we have been doing
[01:55:30.680 --> 01:55:39.280]  for decades anything that needed doing in order to uphold American Empire and
[01:55:39.280 --> 01:55:46.400]  it's really sort of almost a American British Empire there are for a while
[01:55:46.400 --> 01:55:53.920]  we were there junior partner and now there are junior partner but it's all
[01:55:53.920 --> 01:56:04.320]  for Empire and we kick out independent leaders around the world and install
[01:56:04.320 --> 01:56:09.040]  puppet dictators who will sell out their own people for our multinational
[01:56:09.040 --> 01:56:15.040]  corporations and it happens again and again and again and we keep doing it
[01:56:15.040 --> 01:56:24.280]  and most of these independent dictators if you will at one time were CIA
[01:56:24.280 --> 01:56:34.040]  employees most of them got their position with the help of the CIA and then
[01:56:34.040 --> 01:56:38.960]  after they got strong enough then they started becoming independent and
[01:56:38.960 --> 01:56:46.160]  thumbing their nose that what the their American bosses wanted them to do and
[01:56:46.160 --> 01:56:52.920]  one after another whether it's the most there or Noriega or the arm barric or
[01:56:52.920 --> 01:57:00.320]  Saddam he was put in power by the CIA you know one after another then we have to
[01:57:00.320 --> 01:57:08.000]  go fight them and fight them and they're using weapons that we gave them or
[01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:16.880]  sold them and we're fighting fighters that we trained the CIA train the whole
[01:57:16.880 --> 01:57:25.200]  thing is ridiculous and what we need to do is end the Empire and use our armed
[01:57:25.200 --> 01:57:32.120]  forces to protect our borders and our people period not the global financial
[01:57:32.120 --> 01:57:36.360]  interests of multinational corporations and banks well those same
[01:57:36.360 --> 01:57:40.880]  multinationals don't care about America in fact they're destroying our
[01:57:40.880 --> 01:57:44.800]  Republic as well I mean it'd be one thing to be immoral and go along with
[01:57:44.800 --> 01:57:48.640]  this Empire if we were getting part of the spoils that would still be wrong but
[01:57:48.640 --> 01:57:52.520]  we're paying for it and getting none of it and they're turning us into a police
[01:57:52.520 --> 01:57:59.960]  state absolutely we aren't getting the benefit financially that's going to the
[01:57:59.960 --> 01:58:05.120]  global banksters and the multinational corporations that don't pay us any taxes
[01:58:05.120 --> 01:58:12.120]  anyway we're not you know we're losing out all the way around monetarily we're
[01:58:12.120 --> 01:58:16.320]  losing out with the lives of our sons and daughters being used as cannon fodder
[01:58:16.320 --> 01:58:20.720]  in their corporate wars of aggression and we're using losing our
[01:58:20.720 --> 01:58:24.480]  constitutional rights the American people are getting screwed all the way
[01:58:24.480 --> 01:58:29.120]  around by both the Republican and Democratic parties who are owned by
[01:58:29.120 --> 01:58:33.920]  these global money interests dr. Bob Bowman we're out of time the page rich

[02:00:48.600 --> 02:00:52.760]  Ross Ross go ahead hey Alex God bless you and thank you for so much what you're
[02:00:52.760 --> 02:00:57.080]  doing for us Alex I just wanted to tell you when I had the opportunity to read
[02:00:57.080 --> 02:01:01.240]  your article and see the video about the six-year-old girl being molested by the
[02:01:01.240 --> 02:01:06.600]  TSA I absolutely lost it I can't believe how complacent the mother was and
[02:01:06.600 --> 02:01:11.000]  American people to keep the loudness to happen God didn't give me children but I
[02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:14.840]  have to tell you the reason he didn't because I would be in jail because I
[02:01:14.840 --> 02:01:19.000]  would have been all over that situation well that's because you still have your
[02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:24.680]  common sense in your humanity go ahead I just I'm actually shaking inside because
[02:01:24.680 --> 02:01:30.360]  I just can't believe that our country has come to this and well the next step is
[02:01:30.360 --> 02:01:33.200]  hurting people into pits and shooting them in the back of the head I mean the
[02:01:33.200 --> 02:01:36.000]  Nazis did this same thing where they trained people to put their hands on
[02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:40.920]  them at first think about this Alex what if that little girl came back with a so
[02:01:40.920 --> 02:01:45.360]  called positive urine test or blood test first off that little girl's
[02:01:45.360 --> 02:01:49.320]  traumatized for rest of her life and think about this what if those pedophiles
[02:01:49.320 --> 02:01:52.320]  that stand behind those screens watching this decided that was one of the
[02:01:52.320 --> 02:01:55.880]  children they wanted to get into CPS well they've already been doing that and
[02:01:55.880 --> 02:01:58.680]  caught and they've already been caught stealing people's goods and everything
[02:01:58.680 --> 02:02:02.760]  else you can list I mean they're hiring a bunch of crooks at TSA
[02:02:02.760 --> 02:02:07.760]  when Alex the Bible teaches us that we're supposed to shout out the the
[02:02:07.760 --> 02:02:11.640]  injustices that are happening in our country and I guess this is right the
[02:02:11.640 --> 02:02:16.040]  Bible says it a hundred times or more and but the the churches are financed by
[02:02:16.040 --> 02:02:20.200]  the government now and controlled so they say no we're supposed to love this
[02:02:20.200 --> 02:02:25.600]  this is good hand your children over to Mollick no no no that's the worst thing
[02:02:25.600 --> 02:02:29.840]  we can do our children the most precious thing that God has given us and for this
[02:02:29.840 --> 02:02:34.800]  to keep going on it's just I just I'm beside myself at the complacency of the
[02:02:34.800 --> 02:02:38.960]  American people that would have I mean if I have seen something like that
[02:02:38.960 --> 02:02:43.400]  happen in public to somebody's child I would have physically intervened and
[02:02:43.400 --> 02:02:47.040]  snatched that child up I might end up in jail but at least I've been doing the
[02:02:47.040 --> 02:02:50.520]  right well that's what this is this is a test to break our will and normalize
[02:02:50.520 --> 02:02:54.600]  this activity we've got to say no thank you Ralph the video is up on info wars
[02:02:54.600 --> 02:02:59.280]  calm Susie in Wisconsin you're on the year
[02:02:59.280 --> 02:03:06.000]  hello or the last cow was Ross yes Susie go ahead hi I wanted to contribute
[02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:12.200]  that yesterday I picked up my nieces from public school and the first thing my
[02:03:12.200 --> 02:03:18.680]  nieces to me is radiation is good for us so they're teaching them in the public
[02:03:18.680 --> 02:03:22.760]  schools that radiation is good for them just a little bit of radiation is okay
[02:03:22.760 --> 02:03:27.720]  for us evidently so well you just heard a nuclear
[02:03:27.720 --> 02:03:31.800]  physicist former head of the Star Wars program say that that's a lie and we
[02:03:31.800 --> 02:03:37.080]  know it's a lie but this is this is how these people operate show so I mean did
[02:03:37.080 --> 02:03:43.200]  you ask her specifically what she was taught no it was one of her teachers and
[02:03:43.200 --> 02:03:47.400]  conversation and that's one of the first things she told me that she learned
[02:03:47.400 --> 02:03:53.680]  today in school of course the South Koreans are staying indoors and wearing
[02:03:53.680 --> 02:03:59.720]  masks but I guess they're evil yeah yeah and then just the fact of the
[02:03:59.720 --> 02:04:06.680]  demifying our children and there's no longer Chris of writing being taught
[02:04:06.680 --> 02:04:12.440]  in the schools either and so now they won't be able to read past generations
[02:04:12.440 --> 02:04:18.720]  journals she won't be able to read what I write in my diaries well that's what
[02:04:18.720 --> 02:04:25.360]  1984 is all about removing the language dumbing everything down shortening the
[02:04:25.360 --> 02:04:30.520]  the the the rote of the language condensing the things where people
[02:04:30.520 --> 02:04:34.440]  can't communicate it's all being done scientifically we've had the former head
[02:04:34.440 --> 02:04:39.400]  of the Department of Education policy on Charlotte, Israel be to break that down
[02:04:39.400 --> 02:04:42.560]  and she has all the documents in her book that's free online deliberate

[02:04:53.800 --> 02:04:57.360]  break down what the radiation is really doing he's been vindicated from what he
[02:04:57.360 --> 02:05:00.640]  said here three weeks ago about this being as bad as Chernobyl.
[02:05:00.640 --> 02:05:05.040]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.

[02:07:19.160 --> 02:07:22.760]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country
[02:07:22.760 --> 02:07:27.240]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[02:07:27.240 --> 02:07:31.080]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a

[02:08:38.520 --> 02:08:41.480]  he said look this is already as bad or worse than turnable
[02:08:41.480 --> 02:08:45.800]  there's a cover-up we saw the mox one number three reactor blow-up shooting
[02:08:45.800 --> 02:08:49.400]  fuel rods everywhere it's now admitted japanese documents have been released
[02:08:49.400 --> 02:08:52.680]  the new york times buried it but did report that they just covered it
[02:08:52.680 --> 02:08:57.000]  upwards of a mile away spent fuel rods by the thousands the hundreds of thousands
[02:08:57.000 --> 02:09:00.840]  with bulldozers seven point five million times
[02:09:00.840 --> 02:09:05.320]  normal levels of radiation being pumped into the ocean
[02:09:05.320 --> 02:09:09.240]  and now they've had more earthquakes and the governor of the prefecture of
[02:09:09.240 --> 02:09:13.080]  fukushima says there's been a huge cover up their hospitals have filled up
[02:09:13.080 --> 02:09:16.200]  with people with radiation sickness and it was been reported two weeks ago that
[02:09:16.200 --> 02:09:19.240]  many doctors won't treat them believing it's dangerous to be around them
[02:09:19.240 --> 02:09:22.120]  south koreans aren't going to school or work many of them
[02:09:22.120 --> 02:09:25.640]  they're wearing mask uh the chinese are responding
[02:09:25.640 --> 02:09:31.240]  the same way uh here uh there the epa is upping depending on the isotope
[02:09:31.240 --> 02:09:37.640]  24 900 times safe level of radioactive nickel
[02:09:37.640 --> 02:09:43.480]  100 000 times increase in radioactive iodine 131 i've got the list and our
[02:09:43.480 --> 02:09:45.560]  media is basically not even reporting it
[02:09:45.560 --> 02:09:48.600]  uh states and local governments have picked up
[02:09:48.600 --> 02:09:52.520]  uh upwards of 300 times safe levels of radioactive iodine other isotopes and
[02:09:52.520 --> 02:09:57.000]  milk and food uh but they're saying this is safe
[02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:59.880]  and you've got the media with and culture and
[02:09:59.880 --> 02:10:03.560]  others running around saying that this is wonderful
[02:10:03.560 --> 02:10:06.680]  we've also got mom biat as we talked about a few weeks ago saying he's all
[02:10:06.680 --> 02:10:09.080]  for nuclear power now this really shows that it's great
[02:10:09.080 --> 02:10:13.240]  they make these nonsensical statements to just shock us into submission
[02:10:13.240 --> 02:10:17.560]  uh but dr buzzbee joins us to break down the latest developments at fukushima
[02:10:17.560 --> 02:10:21.480]  they now admit as bad a number seven and that's the highest on the scale for
[02:10:21.480 --> 02:10:24.760]  nuclear disaster and they say it may keep going on for months
[02:10:24.760 --> 02:10:28.200]  or even longer uh and it seems like the japanese government's
[02:10:28.200 --> 02:10:31.960]  paralyzed they keep pulling the rescuers out and the emergency workers out
[02:10:31.960 --> 02:10:35.640]  saying the radiation's too high there's neutron beams for three weeks shooting
[02:10:35.640 --> 02:10:39.080]  out uh dr buzzbee it looks like you've been a hundred percent
[02:10:39.080 --> 02:10:44.200]  vindicated from your analysis here uh and that it's even worse than what
[02:10:44.200 --> 02:10:47.160]  you were saying but there's a new sheriff in town
[02:10:47.160 --> 02:10:50.920]  just like you said the key is what they already say is safe is too high
[02:10:50.920 --> 02:10:56.120]  well now they're raising it between 25 000 and 100 000 times safe levels
[02:10:56.120 --> 02:11:02.520]  as pure allison wonderland brainwashing uh enters the equation
[02:11:02.520 --> 02:11:06.600]  well um yes alec's is criminally responsibility in my opinion
[02:11:06.600 --> 02:11:09.880]  and ultimately i think when these people start to die of cancer
[02:11:09.880 --> 02:11:14.120]  i do hope that they can take legal cases against the individuals the named
[02:11:14.120 --> 02:11:18.120]  individuals who i see day and uh every single day being
[02:11:18.120 --> 02:11:22.040]  trotted out endlessly on the television and and in the in the media
[02:11:22.040 --> 02:11:26.280]  generally um talking down this uh this whole disaster
[02:11:26.280 --> 02:11:29.880]  and it is a global catastrophe and i don't think that it's any longer
[02:11:29.880 --> 02:11:32.680]  possible to just leave it to the japanese government
[02:11:32.680 --> 02:11:35.880]  and the japanese uh taxpayers to deal with this because
[02:11:35.880 --> 02:11:39.080]  this is a nuclear industry problem the nuclear industry
[02:11:39.080 --> 02:11:43.000]  who have expanded over the whole of the planet telling us that we would have
[02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:47.000]  energy too safe to be meted and talking about the safety of their
[02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:50.920]  of their of their nuclear reactors it's the nuclear industry that built these
[02:11:50.920 --> 02:11:54.520]  reactors in japan they were even designed in in the united
[02:11:54.520 --> 02:11:57.880]  states they're general electric reactors um
[02:11:57.880 --> 02:12:01.560]  and those are the people it's uh through through the international community
[02:12:01.560 --> 02:12:04.520]  who should who should put the bill and who should go in there
[02:12:04.520 --> 02:12:07.960]  and sort this this business out and the first thing that they should do is start
[02:12:07.960 --> 02:12:13.320]  bringing in clean food to the people in tokyo and iberaki who are
[02:12:13.320 --> 02:12:18.440]  enormous population 36 million people in tokyo and there's even radio
[02:12:18.440 --> 02:12:22.520]  activity to the south and to the west of tokyo now as i see from the studies
[02:12:22.520 --> 02:12:25.560]  that we've done and in the in the area in the 100
[02:12:25.560 --> 02:12:30.920]  kilometer area around fukushima we have already calculated what what the
[02:12:30.920 --> 02:12:34.920]  cancer uh toll will be in the next in the next 10 years and it's
[02:12:34.920 --> 02:12:39.240]  upwards of 200 000 cancers in that in that region and if you
[02:12:39.240 --> 02:12:42.680]  go out to the 200 kilometers and add them all up it's about 400 000 extra
[02:12:42.680 --> 02:12:47.960]  cancers no no so so um
[02:12:47.960 --> 02:12:52.360]  so what can i say i mean i don't want to say hey i told you so because it's also
[02:12:52.360 --> 02:12:55.960]  too depressing that i was that i was right
[02:12:55.960 --> 02:12:59.160]  well expanding on that a week and a half ago india
[02:12:59.160 --> 02:13:03.800]  banned any imports of japanese seafood or produce
[02:13:03.800 --> 02:13:07.320]  or or or any of their other edible products
[02:13:07.320 --> 02:13:11.800]  but here the feds are not releasing radiation levels are not testing fish
[02:13:11.800 --> 02:13:14.760]  they've raised levels saying that's why they don't need to
[02:13:14.760 --> 02:13:19.240]  um and dr bob bowman was on last hour he said people that do eat fish from that
[02:13:19.240 --> 02:13:23.080]  area in a one fish that's been exposed to the 7.5 million
[02:13:23.080 --> 02:13:27.480]  normal levels that that'll be enough to kill people within
[02:13:27.480 --> 02:13:31.320]  a few months to a few years generally you'll just see overall cancer
[02:13:31.320 --> 02:13:34.440]  increases here in the united states that has
[02:13:34.440 --> 02:13:38.120]  double the regular radiation that a place like australia has just from
[02:13:38.120 --> 02:13:41.640]  sure noble not to mention western europe or eastern europe
[02:13:41.640 --> 02:13:46.200]  and so they're just out of sight out of mind no discussion
[02:13:46.200 --> 02:13:49.960]  of even testing people on flights even though they have tested some previously
[02:13:49.960 --> 02:13:52.760]  and found high levels of radiation they just quit doing the testing
[02:13:52.760 --> 02:13:56.440]  so it's a policy of just brushing it under the rug
[02:13:56.440 --> 02:14:00.840]  and acting like it doesn't exist and just allowing all this japanese produce to
[02:14:00.840 --> 02:14:05.480]  be dumped into the united states well this is this is a democratic
[02:14:05.480 --> 02:14:09.560]  issue i i'm i'm a scientist i mean all i can do
[02:14:09.560 --> 02:14:14.120]  is advise on on what i believe to be the consequences of these radiation
[02:14:14.120 --> 02:14:17.560]  exposures and my advice to which we put up on the
[02:14:17.560 --> 02:14:21.400]  website of the low-level radiation campaign and in and also
[02:14:21.400 --> 02:14:24.840]  in another website called bsrrw
[02:14:24.840 --> 02:14:29.080]  Baltic sea radiation risk watch we've been putting our monitoring advice up on
[02:14:29.080 --> 02:14:32.280]  there and our advice to the people is just don't
[02:14:32.280 --> 02:14:35.960]  believe the government i mean don't believe the the spokespeople of the
[02:14:35.960 --> 02:14:39.480]  of the governments of the administrations of the epa of in my
[02:14:39.480 --> 02:14:43.960]  country the health protection agency of the japanese authorities
[02:14:43.960 --> 02:14:48.120]  all of these people all along have been saying there's no problem and then it's
[02:14:48.120 --> 02:14:51.800]  when it's forced up when when something is forced out into the open they then
[02:14:51.800 --> 02:14:54.680]  say oh well it might be a problem but it's not as bad as all that
[02:14:54.680 --> 02:14:58.120]  and it just goes on endlessly endlessly endlessly and just like i said last time
[02:14:58.120 --> 02:15:02.360]  i was on your program but this is just a repeat performance of chinole
[02:15:02.360 --> 02:15:05.480]  actually in the way that it's been covered up in in some sense it's worse
[02:15:05.480 --> 02:15:08.360]  than chinole it's worse than chinole because you know
[02:15:08.360 --> 02:15:12.760]  the russians were scoriated to evacuate the area to 30 kilometers when the
[02:15:12.760 --> 02:15:16.840]  chinole power station exploded very quickly they bused it they brought in
[02:15:16.840 --> 02:15:20.200]  buses from all over the Soviet Union and they got their people out from the
[02:15:20.200 --> 02:15:23.960]  30 kilometer zone in the case of Fukushima they've
[02:15:23.960 --> 02:15:27.240]  they've maintained a 20 kilometer zone even when the international atomic
[02:15:27.240 --> 02:15:31.640]  energy agency was saying that the levels of radioactive contamination on the
[02:15:31.640 --> 02:15:36.440]  ground out to 68 kilometers so this is this is seven times the area of the
[02:15:36.440 --> 02:15:40.520]  chinole contamination zone seven times the area and they
[02:15:40.520 --> 02:15:43.720]  were still allowing people to live there and they still now allow people to live
[02:15:43.720 --> 02:15:47.000]  there so that the exclusion zone which has only now been extended to 30
[02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:51.080]  kilometers is still not adequate it needs to be extended to at least 100
[02:15:51.080 --> 02:15:54.040]  kilometers maybe 200 kilometers and the people of
[02:15:54.040 --> 02:15:58.360]  tokyo and you can see this on on the measurements that
[02:15:58.360 --> 02:16:01.400]  that are available the external radiation measurements that are
[02:16:01.400 --> 02:16:04.040]  extendable from the plane from the japanese website
[02:16:04.040 --> 02:16:08.520]  mixed you can see that the contamination is already significant in tokyo where
[02:16:08.520 --> 02:16:13.720]  you have 36 million people so they need to bring in fresh water fresh food
[02:16:13.720 --> 02:16:17.240]  from from elsewhere from uncontaminated parts of the world
[02:16:17.240 --> 02:16:21.960]  this is a global operation they need to do that now or the the death toll will be
[02:16:21.960 --> 02:16:25.800]  absolutely monstrous and the people responsible should go to jail there's
[02:16:25.800 --> 02:16:29.720]  no question about that but going back to what you said
[02:16:29.720 --> 02:16:33.960]  you're absolutely right about the russian situation the russians covered
[02:16:33.960 --> 02:16:36.520]  it up for a few days but did pull people back
[02:16:36.520 --> 02:16:39.640]  and then they were excoriated for it and still are
[02:16:39.640 --> 02:16:43.640]  but then you see the west with japan and general electric
[02:16:43.640 --> 02:16:46.680]  full court press still involved in a cover-up
[02:16:46.680 --> 02:16:51.400]  at every level it just shows they're they're intending to keep building new
[02:16:51.400 --> 02:16:56.440]  reactors keep the old ones open and just continue moving forward with this
[02:16:56.440 --> 02:16:59.960]  as the fertility drops can you speak more to the
[02:16:59.960 --> 02:17:04.680]  numbers on on what we know increased background radiation is doing
[02:17:04.680 --> 02:17:07.800]  two countries that have these systems in place
[02:17:07.800 --> 02:17:12.040]  well we know we know that from the research that i've done
[02:17:12.040 --> 02:17:15.800]  that the that the nuclear power stations themselves causing a cause about a
[02:17:15.800 --> 02:17:21.480]  doubling of risk of a whole range of cancers and an increased risk maybe
[02:17:21.480 --> 02:17:25.560]  up to 10 times risk of childhood cancers and leukemias
[02:17:25.560 --> 02:17:29.640]  but the real problem is from the radiation itself that they leak endlessly
[02:17:29.640 --> 02:17:34.200]  and from the reprocessing plants that there are
[02:17:34.200 --> 02:17:38.120]  and the waste that is produced and the uranium that is produced as a result of
[02:17:38.120 --> 02:17:42.360]  the uranium mining and most of all the the the nuclear weapons
[02:17:42.360 --> 02:17:47.160]  testing which occurred in the nineteen in the 1960s between 1959 and 1963
[02:17:47.160 --> 02:17:51.720]  there was an orgy of superpower testing which which generated really large
[02:17:51.720 --> 02:17:55.160]  quantities of these novel radio nucides like plutonium
[02:17:55.160 --> 02:17:59.240]  239 and strontium 90 and cesium 137 and all of these
[02:17:59.240 --> 02:18:01.800]  things that are coming out of Fukushima of course
[02:18:01.800 --> 02:18:05.560]  and and and this material together with the depleted uranium that's
[02:18:05.560 --> 02:18:08.760]  being produced that that's being used in large quantities in the various
[02:18:08.760 --> 02:18:13.160]  middle eastern wars and in afghanistan it's just floating about the world
[02:18:13.160 --> 02:18:17.080]  and has increased the the cancer risk in the world so we
[02:18:17.080 --> 02:18:20.360]  we have had a 30 to 40 percent increase in cancer
[02:18:20.360 --> 02:18:23.960]  in real terms i mean you don't need to go to the cancer registry to find the
[02:18:23.960 --> 02:18:27.320]  site you only have to walk down any high street to see the number of cancer
[02:18:27.320 --> 02:18:31.320]  charity shops that have been generated over this period and everybody has
[02:18:31.320 --> 02:18:35.800]  people who've died of cancer who know people even dogs and cats and budgerigars
[02:18:35.800 --> 02:18:38.920]  they've all died of cancer there's an absolute cancer epidemic well this is
[02:18:38.920 --> 02:18:42.840]  this is caused by the increase in the quantity of these novel radioactive
[02:18:42.840 --> 02:18:49.400]  substances into the environment um and the uh and in addition to this of
[02:18:49.400 --> 02:18:52.440]  course as i said last time i was talking with you
[02:18:52.440 --> 02:18:58.600]  they are causing increases infertility in infertility so for so it's getting
[02:18:58.600 --> 02:19:02.200]  harder and harder to have children now so they have all these fancy techno
[02:19:02.200 --> 02:19:06.040]  fixes you know so you can have you can have all sorts of types of test tube
[02:19:06.040 --> 02:19:09.000]  baby and ivf and you can have three parents
[02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:12.360]  as i said to you before in the 60s there was no need for all these things people
[02:19:12.360 --> 02:19:15.960]  had babies more or less when they said hello to each other it was it was a
[02:19:15.960 --> 02:19:19.320]  time not to have babies that seemed to be the problem in those days
[02:19:19.320 --> 02:19:23.240]  so if this goes on and it does seem to be getting a lot worse now with fufish
[02:19:23.240 --> 02:19:26.440]  him because this is going to flood the globe with more radio
[02:19:26.440 --> 02:19:29.240]  nuclides it's going to be a case of actually
[02:19:29.240 --> 02:19:32.760]  having no more people there's going to be so much infertility
[02:19:32.760 --> 02:19:35.880]  in in human beings but also in other species too
[02:19:35.880 --> 02:19:39.960]  that the life on the planet itself will be threatened stay there
[02:19:39.960 --> 02:19:43.640]  there have been measurements made in the middle east uh in jerusalem
[02:19:43.640 --> 02:19:48.680]  a few years ago dr busby stay there we're gonna come right back to you i want
[02:19:48.680 --> 02:19:53.880]  to get to that area on the on the measurements uh in jerusalem and then
[02:19:53.880 --> 02:19:58.040]  we'll also discuss the fact that they're setting the precedent
[02:19:58.040 --> 02:20:01.080]  to just raise the background radiation level and say it's healthy
[02:20:01.080 --> 02:20:04.600]  hi this is alex jones did you know that the global elite are now storing
[02:20:04.600 --> 02:20:07.960]  non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the arctic circle
[02:20:07.960 --> 02:20:11.320]  did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more
[02:20:11.320 --> 02:20:14.520]  valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds have outperformed even
[02:20:14.520 --> 02:20:17.480]  gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even
[02:20:17.480 --> 02:20:20.680]  happen again so our friends at solutions from science
[02:20:20.680 --> 02:20:23.800]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds
[02:20:23.800 --> 02:20:27.320]  they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce
[02:20:27.320 --> 02:20:30.920]  an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family
[02:20:30.920 --> 02:20:34.280]  and here's the best part these seeds have not been genetically modified in
[02:20:34.280 --> 02:20:37.320]  any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full
[02:20:37.320 --> 02:20:41.880]  acre crisis garden so visit them today at survivalseedbank.com

[02:21:07.880 --> 02:21:11.320]  relies on the treasury continuously selling large amounts of government

[02:23:08.360 --> 02:23:12.040]  i've had firsthand experience with the damage mercury can do to the body

[02:23:15.400 --> 02:23:19.240]  large mercury fillings put into my teeth i also know the most effective means by
[02:23:19.240 --> 02:23:23.080]  which the body can remove mercury it has to do in large part with how well your
[02:23:23.080 --> 02:23:26.120]  liver functions and how much glutathione your cells produce

[02:24:13.400 --> 02:24:17.480]  chemical physicist nuclear radiation poisoning expert under christopher
[02:24:17.480 --> 02:24:24.200]  busby is our guest doctor you you are getting into
[02:24:24.200 --> 02:24:28.440]  radiation levels uh rising in and around the holy land
[02:24:28.440 --> 02:24:32.120]  but then i wanted in the brief time we have left with you uh correct me if i'm
[02:24:32.120 --> 02:24:35.080]  wrong with the system is openly just saying look we're just going to raise
[02:24:35.080 --> 02:24:38.520]  normal background levels and just get you to accept that
[02:24:38.520 --> 02:24:43.480]  radiation is good for you and the japanese ought to be thankful
[02:24:43.480 --> 02:24:48.280]  and just like until 1991 they wouldn't let the troops use du
[02:24:48.280 --> 02:24:52.120]  after that they waved a magic wand said ignore all the old army reports saying
[02:24:52.120 --> 02:24:55.320]  it'll kill troops you know with a soft kill in a few
[02:24:55.320 --> 02:24:59.480]  decades if they use this weapon maybe even quicker and now they just say go
[02:24:59.480 --> 02:25:04.200]  ahead and use it so the attitude is uh just go all the way
[02:25:04.200 --> 02:25:09.080]  well radiation is not good for you and and the the risk agencies all of the
[02:25:09.080 --> 02:25:14.120]  international risk agencies uh will will state in their documents that the
[02:25:14.120 --> 02:25:18.680]  smallest dose of radiation can cause damage and and that damage can lead to
[02:25:18.680 --> 02:25:22.440]  cancer so radiation is not good for you so that's the first thing
[02:25:22.440 --> 02:25:26.440]  the second thing is that if you have a set of regulations that relate to to
[02:25:26.440 --> 02:25:29.640]  something that's acceptable in terms of radiation exposure
[02:25:29.640 --> 02:25:32.840]  in other words to illness because they just said that is illness
[02:25:32.840 --> 02:25:37.640]  then you can't just suddenly change those i mean in what way do you have any
[02:25:37.640 --> 02:25:42.120]  mandate from from from uh the people from the public who
[02:25:42.120 --> 02:25:48.840]  who whose taxes pay you to protect them uh to just arbitrarily change change the
[02:25:48.840 --> 02:25:51.880]  baseline when when you decide that it that is useful to the
[02:25:51.880 --> 02:25:55.880]  nuclear industry to do that it's totally unacceptable it's
[02:25:55.880 --> 02:25:59.800]  it's it's quite wrong it's in fact criminally wrong in my opinion
[02:25:59.800 --> 02:26:02.360]  yes sir you were before you got interrupted by the breakey we're getting
[02:26:02.360 --> 02:26:07.080]  into increased radiation levels in israel well i was saying that that
[02:26:07.080 --> 02:26:12.600]  but following the the the increase in the concentration of uranium from the
[02:26:12.600 --> 02:26:17.720]  uranium weapons usage in 1991 the whole of the of that area has
[02:26:17.720 --> 02:26:22.760]  become contaminated with uranium particles and uh there there was a study
[02:26:22.760 --> 02:26:27.160]  done a couple of years ago of sperm of sperm counts in young
[02:26:27.160 --> 02:26:31.080]  men in in jerusalem and i think that the figure was that there was a 40
[02:26:31.080 --> 02:26:34.520]  percent reduction in the last 10 years in the in the sperm can the viable
[02:26:34.520 --> 02:26:39.000]  sperm count in young men who who were studied in this Jerusalem hospital
[02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:42.520]  and the conclusions of the people doing the study said that if it continued at
[02:26:42.520 --> 02:26:45.720]  that rate because there was a rate of falling over the last 10 years by the
[02:26:45.720 --> 02:26:49.960]  year 2020 there would be no more Israeli people that would be the end of it
[02:26:49.960 --> 02:26:53.320]  because everybody would be infertile i think that's rather
[02:26:53.320 --> 02:26:57.720]  rather rather a problem really and it's similar to the general fall in sperm
[02:26:57.720 --> 02:27:00.760]  counts that have occurred in globally since the
[02:27:00.760 --> 02:27:04.600]  weapons fall out of it in the 1960s
[02:27:05.400 --> 02:27:11.720]  now looking at this uh obviously this is a disaster for the nuclear industry
[02:27:11.720 --> 02:27:15.080]  that's why they're trying the psychological tactic uh of just
[02:27:15.080 --> 02:27:19.480]  throwing it in everybody's face uh right now uh do you think that's going
[02:27:19.480 --> 02:27:22.920]  to be successful with their with their psychological judo of
[02:27:22.920 --> 02:27:26.520]  saying everyone should be thankful this is good well i have to say that we have
[02:27:26.520 --> 02:27:29.800]  had massive support for for the various programs
[02:27:29.800 --> 02:27:33.480]  where i've managed to get into the media to argue all of these things that i've
[02:27:33.480 --> 02:27:39.240]  been arguing basically arguing that the dose uh that the dose risk
[02:27:39.240 --> 02:27:42.680]  idea that they have the risk model that they have is totally incorrect for
[02:27:42.680 --> 02:27:48.120]  internal radio nucleides and um i think the people are not fooled
[02:27:48.120 --> 02:27:50.760]  anymore i have to say that i think probably because of the internet and
[02:27:50.760 --> 02:27:54.520]  because of people like you people who who can get the truth out
[02:27:54.520 --> 02:27:58.520]  onto the internet and through independent channels of communication
[02:27:58.520 --> 02:28:01.480]  i think that the people are no longer the public are no longer fooled anyway
[02:28:01.480 --> 02:28:04.920]  sincerely hope that that's the case and they are voting that they're free too
[02:28:04.920 --> 02:28:07.720]  they they they aren't drinking the water and they aren't
[02:28:07.720 --> 02:28:10.760]  drinking the milk and so they're not really taking the advice that is given
[02:28:10.760 --> 02:28:14.520]  to them by the by the authorities and now it's all over the
[02:28:14.520 --> 02:28:18.200]  japanese news that the people are becoming enraged they know they've been
[02:28:18.200 --> 02:28:24.360]  lied to so even the um the very polite japanese uh
[02:28:24.360 --> 02:28:27.800]  slow to anger are coming out and saying we know this is a fraud
[02:28:27.800 --> 02:28:30.840]  i've seen the reports now for two weeks though that japanese doctors are so
[02:28:30.840 --> 02:28:35.000]  concerned about radiation that they're refusing to even treat in some areas
[02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:38.120]  people with radiation poisoning because they don't want to come in contact with
[02:28:38.120 --> 02:28:42.440]  them uh i mean that's that's terrible on the surface but
[02:28:42.440 --> 02:28:45.640]  that'll give you an idea of just how serious this is
[02:28:45.640 --> 02:28:49.560]  yes it is very serious and it may even be more serious than than is being
[02:28:49.560 --> 02:28:53.800]  suggested now last time i spoke with you i said i thought that this was a
[02:28:53.800 --> 02:28:58.200]  singularly japanese problem but i think that these reactors are
[02:28:58.200 --> 02:29:01.000]  still efficient we know from the reactor from the
[02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:04.520]  isotope ratios that are being measured some of the isotopes that are being
[02:29:04.520 --> 02:29:07.160]  measured are very short-life isotopes which only occur after
[02:29:07.160 --> 02:29:10.120]  efficient and so we know that these these reactors are still
[02:29:10.120 --> 02:29:13.240]  efficient so this material is still being released it's not as if it all
[02:29:13.240 --> 02:29:16.360]  released suddenly and that's it and all we've got to do now is kind of
[02:29:16.360 --> 02:29:20.280]  self cover it up with concrete then i hope it'll go away that isn't the case
[02:29:20.280 --> 02:29:24.120]  what you've got is naked reactors functioning there on the ground in the
[02:29:24.120 --> 02:29:27.000]  open and producing radioactivity which is slowly going to
[02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:30.360]  pollute the planet and something has to be done about it
[02:29:30.360 --> 02:29:33.960]  it's potentially extremely dangerous. Dr. Busby do five more minutes where this
[02:29:33.960 --> 02:29:36.680]  time we're going to go everybody's calls i want you to be able to finish up
[02:29:36.680 --> 02:29:40.440]  with the fact that we have these boiling burning exploding cauldrons
[02:29:40.440 --> 02:29:44.600]  and now the japanese government under the radar says this could go on for months
[02:29:44.600 --> 02:29:47.880]  this could go on for years well they're right back and look at the
[02:29:47.880 --> 02:29:51.240]  different scenarios that could unfold
[02:29:51.240 --> 02:29:55.080]  we're on the march the empires on the run

[02:32:25.160 --> 02:32:29.320]  when the alert is broadcast the alarm sounds or the knock comes on your door
[02:32:29.320 --> 02:32:32.280]  you'll need to be ready to act without thinking of what to do
[02:32:32.280 --> 02:32:36.520]  or what you need you need a five-day extreme emergency kit
[02:32:36.520 --> 02:32:40.440]  with serious supplies and real food to secure two adults for five days
[02:32:40.440 --> 02:32:43.800]  this powerful three hundred dollar extreme emergency kit
[02:32:43.800 --> 02:32:47.880]  is free with an order of at least nine hundred ninety five dollars from e-foods
[02:32:47.880 --> 02:32:51.000]  direct go to e-foods direct dot com slash alex

[02:33:09.400 --> 02:33:15.400]  no one's gonna take me
[02:33:15.720 --> 02:33:19.640]  dr christopher busby radiation specialist
[02:33:19.640 --> 02:33:22.360]  chemical physicists is our guest for a few more minutes that i'm going to your
[02:33:22.360 --> 02:33:26.280]  phone calls and other important news today but
[02:33:26.280 --> 02:33:30.200]  uh when we went to the break you were getting into the fact that
[02:33:30.200 --> 02:33:35.480]  this is ongoing and it's so bad the radiation so high they've pulled out
[02:33:35.480 --> 02:33:42.280]  the emergency workers yet again and they're talking about people getting
[02:33:42.280 --> 02:33:45.560]  in just five hours working there enough of a dose that
[02:33:45.560 --> 02:33:48.440]  the head of the plant said it would roughly kill half the people that come
[02:33:48.440 --> 02:33:51.080]  in contact with it we're not seeing a lot of reports about
[02:33:51.080 --> 02:33:54.600]  radiation sickness we see some going back two weeks ago in the hospitals
[02:33:54.600 --> 02:33:58.840]  so it looks like that's being uh underplayed uh there we
[02:33:58.840 --> 02:34:02.120]  we see our media here in the united states saying hey don't worry the
[02:34:02.120 --> 02:34:07.080]  government is raising a safe level uh but but um you
[02:34:07.080 --> 02:34:10.600]  i want you to speak about the different scenarios that can now unfold at these
[02:34:10.600 --> 02:34:14.280]  six reactors including two of them they successfully shut down
[02:34:14.280 --> 02:34:17.400]  number five has still had problems and partial meltdown
[02:34:17.400 --> 02:34:21.080]  i want to talk about that in closing but i also
[02:34:21.080 --> 02:34:25.080]  want to go back to you mentioned an event in russia in the early 50s
[02:34:25.080 --> 02:34:29.320]  where a a facility holding rods actually blew up
[02:34:29.320 --> 02:34:32.920]  and i want to talk about what type of explosion that was please continue
[02:34:32.920 --> 02:34:37.560]  yes okay well as far as the future is concerned we are really in science
[02:34:37.560 --> 02:34:40.680]  fiction territory so i don't want to make two predictions about
[02:34:40.680 --> 02:34:44.680]  too many predictions about this what you have is you have reactors
[02:34:44.680 --> 02:34:49.240]  that are reacting that normally would be reacting inside a metal container
[02:34:49.240 --> 02:34:53.000]  where everything was kept inside and all the radionuclides were inside it
[02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:57.400]  but these are now reacting outside and so all the radionuclides that are
[02:34:57.400 --> 02:35:00.920]  being produced all the huge amounts of fish in the radionuclides
[02:35:00.920 --> 02:35:04.360]  that are being produced are just being distributed out into the atmosphere
[02:35:04.360 --> 02:35:07.960]  and into the water that's surrounding this and then of course when the rain falls
[02:35:07.960 --> 02:35:10.680]  goes into the sea and then the sea will then
[02:35:10.680 --> 02:35:13.720]  distribute this stuff up and down the coast and eventually
[02:35:13.720 --> 02:35:17.320]  it will it will begin to contaminate the pacific but pacific is very big
[02:35:17.320 --> 02:35:21.160]  that is i mean in the in in the few months time i don't think that
[02:35:21.160 --> 02:35:25.000]  the long-range problem there will be very great but a lot of the gaseous
[02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:28.280]  radionuclides will certainly make their way across the united states and
[02:35:28.280 --> 02:35:31.640]  already they're doing that and there are there are increased levels there which i
[02:35:31.640 --> 02:35:34.360]  think are now becoming a cause for concern
[02:35:34.360 --> 02:35:37.720]  um so you've got this stuff out of the box that that's the problem there and
[02:35:37.720 --> 02:35:41.320]  something has to be done about it now i have to tell you that this is
[02:35:41.320 --> 02:35:45.000]  this is some confidential information that came to me i can't say who from
[02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:48.440]  but they're they're so concerned about it the authorities
[02:35:48.440 --> 02:35:52.120]  that they're they're they're developed an argument between the united states
[02:35:52.120 --> 02:35:55.400]  advisors and the french advisors over what to do
[02:35:55.400 --> 02:35:59.480]  and the united states advisors wanted to bomb these reactors into the sea
[02:35:59.480 --> 02:36:03.160]  and the and the the french advisors wanted to drop concrete on top of them
[02:36:03.160 --> 02:36:05.880]  this will seal them up but the other problem there is if you seal them up
[02:36:05.880 --> 02:36:09.320]  they're still fishing away underneath the concrete and that will go on virtually
[02:36:09.320 --> 02:36:12.360]  forever certainly for a very long time you know as
[02:36:12.360 --> 02:36:16.680]  much as a year and so so we have and there's there would be a good
[02:36:16.680 --> 02:36:19.800]  argument for bombing them into the sea because rather than taking the sea water
[02:36:19.800 --> 02:36:22.920]  to the reactor you take the reactor to the sea water and then if you split it up
[02:36:22.920 --> 02:36:26.360]  into small enough pieces you could use the fishing then in the sense you could
[02:36:26.360 --> 02:36:30.280]  seal off that bit of sea and then pick them up with robots from under the water
[02:36:30.280 --> 02:36:33.960]  that might be a possibility but i'd like i say this is science fiction stuff you
[02:36:33.960 --> 02:36:37.160]  know i mean who can possibly figure out what the
[02:36:37.160 --> 02:36:40.360]  best way to do this is we we have a global catastrophe
[02:36:40.360 --> 02:36:44.280]  on our hands here as i said it was potentially a global catastrophe now
[02:36:44.280 --> 02:36:49.640]  we go to kishtim in in in in 1959 i think it was
[02:36:49.640 --> 02:36:52.920]  there was a 57 there was an explosion in kishtim
[02:36:52.920 --> 02:36:57.560]  in the mayak facility at chelio binsk and that was an explosion
[02:36:57.560 --> 02:37:01.320]  related to the fuel rods which which melted down
[02:37:01.320 --> 02:37:05.720]  in a in a in a fuel in a nuclear waste repository
[02:37:05.720 --> 02:37:09.240]  and the explosion contaminates i think it was a thousand square kilometers of
[02:37:09.240 --> 02:37:13.480]  land which became became became completely
[02:37:13.480 --> 02:37:16.520]  isolated nobody could go in there was highly radioactive
[02:37:16.520 --> 02:37:19.960]  so it is entirely possible that there might be an explosion but i think
[02:37:19.960 --> 02:37:24.280]  actually in the case of this uh unless the plutonium concentrations get
[02:37:24.280 --> 02:37:27.960]  get high or become separated in some way then probably there won't be an
[02:37:27.960 --> 02:37:31.000]  explosion there'll be a like a sort of ongoing explosion if you like to think
[02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:33.880]  of it like that well that was my next point is that i've read
[02:37:33.880 --> 02:37:37.880]  i've read some physicists say that if they are able to separate out the
[02:37:37.880 --> 02:37:41.880]  plutonium the uranium and then other isotopes that you can get some type of
[02:37:41.880 --> 02:37:45.080]  actual chain reaction then i've had other physicists gone
[02:37:45.080 --> 02:37:49.160]  who say that they don't think that that was possible but the same physicists said
[02:37:49.160 --> 02:37:52.200]  he didn't think five or six could have a meltdown because they'd been shut down
[02:37:52.200 --> 02:37:57.400]  before the event and five has no i don't think anybody knows
[02:37:57.400 --> 02:37:59.960]  quite what happens at these temperatures under these conditions and
[02:37:59.960 --> 02:38:03.880]  there are all sorts of parameters that have never been involved before like
[02:38:03.880 --> 02:38:08.280]  sea water like sodium chloride like molten salt all sorts of things that
[02:38:08.280 --> 02:38:13.240]  would never have been been experimented on so in principle it might be possible
[02:38:13.240 --> 02:38:18.120]  for plutonium to separate from the general mix for there to be a kishjim type
[02:38:18.120 --> 02:38:21.400]  explosion in which case it would blow all this stuff vaporize it all this stuff
[02:38:21.400 --> 02:38:24.680]  up into the atmosphere and then we would really be in deep trouble
[02:38:24.680 --> 02:38:29.160]  so there might be some uh some argument and i think maybe this is why
[02:38:29.160 --> 02:38:33.160]  that there was this this panicky hysterical decision to bomb them into
[02:38:33.160 --> 02:38:36.840]  the sea but maybe maybe there's some sense in that who knows
[02:38:36.840 --> 02:38:40.040]  okay final question we're going to let you go down to buzz we appreciate the
[02:38:40.040 --> 02:38:46.200]  time uh looking at this uh situation at
[02:38:46.200 --> 02:38:50.360]  Fukushima i i know you don't like to look into the future
[02:38:50.360 --> 02:38:53.480]  but they've said it could go on for months or longer
[02:38:53.480 --> 02:38:57.160]  i mean from researching this from seeing other cases
[02:38:57.160 --> 02:39:03.640]  how long do you think it could go on a and then b uh we see reports
[02:39:03.640 --> 02:39:07.640]  of uh you know governments in the un saying that
[02:39:07.640 --> 02:39:11.640]  Chernobyl in 86 was 400 times a hereshima
[02:39:11.640 --> 02:39:15.160]  why are reactor meltdowns so much more
[02:39:15.160 --> 02:39:19.560]  dirty than an atomic or hydrogen explosion or is that wrong
[02:39:19.560 --> 02:39:22.360]  yeah no that's right they are more dirty and the reason they're more dirty is
[02:39:22.360 --> 02:39:24.680]  because they have lost amounts of uranium
[02:39:24.680 --> 02:39:28.840]  i mean the atomic bomb at the hereshima was a limited amount of uranium i don't
[02:39:28.840 --> 02:39:32.840]  know the kilograms you know maybe a ton total
[02:39:32.840 --> 02:39:35.640]  what we're talking about here is several thousand tons
[02:39:35.640 --> 02:39:40.040]  i mean the fuel the number of spent fuel rods there i understood it was about
[02:39:40.040 --> 02:39:44.280]  1700 tons of of spent fuel and each of these
[02:39:44.280 --> 02:39:47.560]  reactors probably contains about a hundred to hundred and fifty tons
[02:39:47.560 --> 02:39:51.240]  of uranium and and plutonium and mixed mixed radio in new kites so there's
[02:39:51.240 --> 02:39:56.280]  just a lot more stuff that's basically it the the Chernobyl accident which i
[02:39:56.280 --> 02:39:59.400]  think actually now having talked to some russians last week in
[02:39:59.400 --> 02:40:03.400]  berlin was a nuclear explosion and not a hydrogen explosion because it was a
[02:40:03.400 --> 02:40:07.720]  particular fission ratio of the enone isotopes which defined it as a nuclear
[02:40:07.720 --> 02:40:11.960]  explosion that one vaporized that very most 200 tons
[02:40:11.960 --> 02:40:15.400]  and the argument was that it was only 50 tons well here we have a lot more than
[02:40:15.400 --> 02:40:19.880]  that we have a huge amount of of of fuel here that can go up in the air and
[02:40:19.880 --> 02:40:23.400]  is and has a lot of it already has
[02:40:24.200 --> 02:40:28.600]  so clearly from the russian example uh some type of chain reaction
[02:40:28.600 --> 02:40:32.680]  is theoretically possible again i i i'm i i'm
[02:40:32.680 --> 02:40:36.680]  that is right the russian explosion which everybody has said and they
[02:40:36.680 --> 02:40:40.120]  still are saying with a hydrogen explosion i talked to some russian
[02:40:40.120 --> 02:40:44.280]  nucleophilicists last week in berlin and they showed
[02:40:44.280 --> 02:40:47.560]  information from the radium institute in zane petersberg they measured the
[02:40:47.560 --> 02:40:51.480]  isotopes enone one three three and enone one three three m
[02:40:51.480 --> 02:40:54.920]  and the ratio between those two isotopes defines whether it's a nuclear
[02:40:54.920 --> 02:40:59.000]  explosion or whether it's just a nuclear fission inside a reactor it's either
[02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:02.680]  22 or it's 12 and i think it was 15 so in other
[02:41:02.680 --> 02:41:05.240]  words it was a nuclear mainly a nuclear explosion
[02:41:05.240 --> 02:41:08.760]  Chernobyl not a hydrogen explosion as they said and my belief is that these
[02:41:08.760 --> 02:41:12.120]  also have been nuclear explosions and not hydrogen explosion whoa
[02:41:12.120 --> 02:41:15.000]  whoa i said last question but this is bombshell
[02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:18.280]  you're out there you're on major boards in europe you're talking to
[02:41:18.280 --> 02:41:22.600]  to top nuclear engineers and not only does it look like there was a nuclear
[02:41:22.600 --> 02:41:25.160]  explosion at this fifties event in russia
[02:41:25.160 --> 02:41:29.240]  they're saying chernobyl was really some type of atomic chain reaction
[02:41:29.240 --> 02:41:33.480]  correct absolutely so the definition is based on the measurements of
[02:41:33.480 --> 02:41:37.560]  xenon isotope ratios made at the at the radium institute in
[02:41:37.560 --> 02:41:41.240]  st petersberg it was it was it was it was given as a
[02:41:41.240 --> 02:41:45.880]  paper by two russian nuclear physicists from the institute last week and look
[02:41:45.880 --> 02:41:49.480]  in a in a chernobyl conference in berlin where i was talking
[02:41:49.480 --> 02:41:54.520]  dr buzz beat can i uh ask you a favor or a favor for humanity
[02:41:54.520 --> 02:41:57.320]  i want to have curtain emma one of my writers
[02:41:57.320 --> 02:42:01.880]  right now well we'll call him up here uh and call you back at home or your
[02:42:01.880 --> 02:42:05.960]  office or can you send uh to an email we'll give you maybe a
[02:42:05.960 --> 02:42:09.160]  two paragraph write up to make sure we get the isotopes
[02:42:09.160 --> 02:42:12.920]  correct and sure there are zero and one three three and zero and one two
[02:42:12.920 --> 02:42:15.560]  three m which is a metastable isotope of xenon
[02:42:15.560 --> 02:42:19.400]  sure it's just my writers because they're not nuclear physicists or chemical
[02:42:19.400 --> 02:42:23.080]  physicists don't like to do this
[02:42:28.680 --> 02:42:33.080]  yeah what we're going to do sir is is we're going to give you our email and
[02:42:33.080 --> 02:42:35.400]  if you could just write up in two paragraphs
[02:42:35.400 --> 02:42:40.840]  so yeah okay what you just said uh jaren will you put dr buzz beat on hold
[02:42:40.840 --> 02:42:44.600]  and uh here in a moment and uh give him your email
[02:42:44.600 --> 02:42:47.560]  and and and just because when the show ends sir i'm going to go write an
[02:42:47.560 --> 02:42:50.840]  article with curtain emmo how fast can you send me just two paragraphs to be
[02:42:50.840 --> 02:42:54.440]  putting the story well i could i could do it in five minutes okay
[02:42:54.440 --> 02:42:57.400]  okay well that's very gracious anything else you'd like to add we'll put it
[02:42:57.400 --> 02:43:00.280]  into a story because you are highly respected one of the
[02:43:00.280 --> 02:43:04.200]  chief advisors to the bbc as well just in closing because because you said
[02:43:04.200 --> 02:43:07.080]  something very powerful there you're saying and you've been proving completely
[02:43:07.080 --> 02:43:09.400]  right and you're in your analysis of the last
[02:43:09.400 --> 02:43:15.960]  month in two days you're saying sir that evidence points towards chain reaction
[02:43:15.960 --> 02:43:20.360]  some type of atomic explosion in and around fukushima and and and
[02:43:20.360 --> 02:43:23.560]  that's what you're saying but no i'm saying that chenobyl was a nuclear
[02:43:23.560 --> 02:43:26.360]  explosion but i'm saying that there's no evidence that there was a nuclear
[02:43:26.360 --> 02:43:29.720]  explosion at fukushima but my belief is that there was okay
[02:43:29.720 --> 02:43:32.840]  so we don't have evidence for that we would have to have the xenon isotope
[02:43:32.840 --> 02:43:36.440]  ratios but what i am saying is that all of this talk about hydrogen
[02:43:36.440 --> 02:43:39.000]  explosions and chenobyl being a hydrogen explosion
[02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:42.840]  is not too hard for chenobyl chenobyl is not a hydrogen explosion it was a
[02:43:42.840 --> 02:43:48.200]  nuclear explosion okay i understand that and and and and
[02:43:48.200 --> 02:43:53.080]  what really puts the cherry on top of or the cuda grass of this whole thing
[02:43:53.080 --> 02:43:58.840]  is that they will never release the actual isotope readings we've noticed
[02:43:58.840 --> 02:44:02.520]  and for three weeks they wouldn't release anything for the two prefectures
[02:44:02.520 --> 02:44:05.800]  in and around fukushima which they now admit they didn't release because they
[02:44:05.800 --> 02:44:09.000]  didn't want to scare people and that adds weight to what you're saying if they
[02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:12.360]  don't want to release the exact isotope readings that's because they don't want
[02:44:12.360 --> 02:44:16.200]  the fingerprint of atomic chain reaction
[02:44:16.200 --> 02:44:19.480]  maybe so but my feeling is not that my feeling is that they don't want people
[02:44:19.480 --> 02:44:22.600]  to know how much plutonium and uranium they're exploding about because that's
[02:44:22.600 --> 02:44:27.560]  the really dangerous stuff all this iodine is the focus on iodine
[02:44:27.560 --> 02:44:32.120]  is a red herring in a way and and even on cesium 137 but the
[02:44:32.120 --> 02:44:35.800]  really seriously dangerous isotopes are the are the uranium isotopes
[02:44:35.800 --> 02:44:38.760]  and the and plutonium because they are alpha emitters
[02:44:38.760 --> 02:44:42.280]  and they and they come along in particles at particulates so they
[02:44:42.280 --> 02:44:45.320]  close about the place like little hot coals and then when you inhale them they
[02:44:45.320 --> 02:44:48.760]  go inside you and produce massive doses to the local tissue
[02:44:48.760 --> 02:44:53.320]  that's the problem okay we'll do this it's those particular alpha emitters
[02:44:53.320 --> 02:44:55.640]  that we need to know about and we certainly need to know about them in
[02:44:55.640 --> 02:44:59.240]  the united states as well because if there's a slight increase in iodine
[02:44:59.240 --> 02:45:02.440]  it could well be that that's that that's associated also with
[02:45:02.440 --> 02:45:05.880]  with the existence of these airborne particles and it's the particles that
[02:45:05.880 --> 02:45:09.400]  are the problem say nothing of the tritium we haven't heard about the
[02:45:09.400 --> 02:45:13.080]  isotope tritium which will be produced in massive massive massive amounts
[02:45:13.080 --> 02:45:16.280]  that's tritiated water with sort of radioactive water
[02:45:16.280 --> 02:45:19.800]  i would like to know very much what the tritium level is in the tap water in
[02:45:19.800 --> 02:45:22.200]  tokyo
[02:45:22.360 --> 02:45:25.320]  uh well they have reported some tritium levels i've seen that in the press
[02:45:25.320 --> 02:45:28.360]  now expanding on this and we're going to let you go
[02:45:28.360 --> 02:45:31.880]  just perhaps so we have a grasp of the history a paragraph on the russian
[02:45:31.880 --> 02:45:33.960]  incident a paragraph on your meeting with the
[02:45:33.960 --> 02:45:36.600]  russian scientist on chernobyl believing that that was some type of
[02:45:36.600 --> 02:45:39.960]  atomic explosion and then your statement on that so we
[02:45:39.960 --> 02:45:42.920]  could have those three paragraphs from you anything else you'd like to add
[02:45:42.920 --> 02:45:45.880]  we we we really appreciate your gracious time
[02:45:45.880 --> 02:45:48.920]  and what is the best website for us to learn more dr busby
[02:45:48.920 --> 02:45:52.040]  we're putting all stuff on we're putting all our stuff on the website of the
[02:45:52.040 --> 02:45:56.760]  low-level radiation campaign lllrc.org but in terms of the risk model you
[02:45:56.760 --> 02:45:58.920]  need to go to the european committee on radiation
[02:45:58.920 --> 02:46:02.600]  risk website where we have now because of the fukushima accident
[02:46:02.600 --> 02:46:07.240]  we have now released the 2010 report as a free download so anybody can have
[02:46:07.240 --> 02:46:10.680]  that was a that cost 70 70 pounds that was a
[02:46:10.680 --> 02:46:15.000]  to buy that report but now it because of the the extraordinary
[02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:18.520]  developments in fukushima we feel that everybody should have access to that
[02:46:18.520 --> 02:46:21.960]  report so it's a free download from from the
[02:46:21.960 --> 02:46:27.400]  urad.com e-u-r-a-d-c-o-m dot org you can get it from there and this is the
[02:46:27.400 --> 02:46:30.920]  this is the risk model that will tell you how many people are going to die after
[02:46:30.920 --> 02:46:34.440]  any sort of exposure yeah well my dad's two words
[02:46:34.440 --> 02:46:37.800]  my dad separately took physics at ut where they have a reactor when he was
[02:46:37.800 --> 02:46:41.160]  in college and he said they talked in that they believed a meltdown
[02:46:41.160 --> 02:46:44.040]  could properly separate out like you said and then
[02:46:44.040 --> 02:46:47.480]  uh i don't want to butcher what he said but then some type of
[02:46:47.480 --> 02:46:51.160]  ion beam or almost electrical charge could go through it
[02:46:51.160 --> 02:46:55.960]  and that that could create the chain reaction am i butchering what he said
[02:46:55.960 --> 02:46:59.240]  i don't know i didn't hear what he said but my my the point is that if you have
[02:46:59.240 --> 02:47:03.560]  enough plutonium together in one place the neutron flux gets high enough to
[02:47:03.560 --> 02:47:07.880]  for it to to achieve a prompt criticality so the question is whether or not the
[02:47:07.880 --> 02:47:11.560]  plutonium can separate from the uranium plutonium octo can separate from the
[02:47:11.560 --> 02:47:14.440]  uranium oxide at these extremely high temperatures
[02:47:14.440 --> 02:47:17.880]  that there are and i don't i don't know i don't think enough is known to be able
[02:47:17.880 --> 02:47:21.080]  to say that that is impossible all right amazing we're going to put you on hold
[02:47:21.080 --> 02:47:24.840]  and give you that internal email we've got you make sure we've got your email
[02:47:24.840 --> 02:47:27.720]  and we're we're waiting in the next 20 minutes or so to get that
[02:47:27.720 --> 02:47:31.240]  that that key email so we can add that to an article we're going to do
[02:47:31.240 --> 02:47:34.360]  dr christopher busby thank you for joining us okay
[02:47:34.360 --> 02:47:37.800]  all right amazing uh information there ladies and gentlemen
[02:47:37.800 --> 02:47:43.720]  uh so um that would basically
[02:47:43.720 --> 02:47:48.040]  really change the whole paradigm of what we're looking at here
[02:47:48.040 --> 02:47:51.400]  and i i went online and read other physicists uh saying
[02:47:51.400 --> 02:47:55.800]  that uh that that there could be some type of atomic reaction
[02:47:55.800 --> 02:48:00.120]  nuclear you know explosion uh with these reactors and then i
[02:48:00.120 --> 02:48:03.880]  talked to a lot of other people uh and did some more research and they say that
[02:48:03.880 --> 02:48:06.600]  that it is in the realm of possibility but regardless you got the equivalent
[02:48:06.600 --> 02:48:09.960]  of dirty bombs going off every day just pumping this into the atmosphere we'll
[02:48:09.960 --> 02:48:14.040]  take calls the rest of this segment and the next i didn't mean to keep
[02:48:14.040 --> 02:48:18.280]  dr busby that long but that information was just too powerful
[02:48:18.280 --> 02:48:22.440]  let's go ahead and talk to daniel in new jersey daniel you're on the air welcome
[02:48:22.440 --> 02:48:28.040]  thanks for holding hi i've had two questions i graduated high school last
[02:48:28.040 --> 02:48:31.800]  year and i came across this show while traveling in my gap year full college
[02:48:31.800 --> 02:48:35.320]  and i used to live a really like sheltered life full of the
[02:48:35.320 --> 02:48:39.400]  typical middle class american lives lives but now you know if there were things
[02:48:39.400 --> 02:48:42.440]  you're showing a lot of books and documentaries that i've read i think
[02:48:42.440 --> 02:48:46.440]  i have a really you know good grip on the real world i live in
[02:48:46.440 --> 02:48:52.120]  um i really have a value to my name is a job and time and my question to you is
[02:48:52.120 --> 02:48:56.120]  you know how not just me but other young adults my age
[02:48:56.120 --> 02:48:59.400]  invest our time or resources with the uh
[02:48:59.400 --> 02:49:03.080]  intending troubles to come well i wouldn't wait till you perfect your
[02:49:03.080 --> 02:49:06.440]  message or your information i would go it might be a town
[02:49:06.440 --> 02:49:10.280]  50 miles away it might be the town you're in but i would go and take the
[02:49:10.280 --> 02:49:14.440]  little classes and pay the fee or whatever and do a live access tv show
[02:49:14.440 --> 02:49:17.640]  or a tape tv show whether you reach 100 people in a small
[02:49:17.640 --> 02:49:20.920]  town or 10 000 in a city like austin on average would
[02:49:20.920 --> 02:49:25.400]  have access show i would air films on access i would start a blog
[02:49:25.400 --> 02:49:29.000]  uh start shooting your own youtube videos you know that's free just the
[02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:31.800]  webcam uh and i would have your voice heard and
[02:49:31.800 --> 02:49:35.320]  reach out to other people and start a local organization for liberty
[02:49:35.320 --> 02:49:39.160]  sons and daughters of liberty and i would you know get together with like-minded
[02:49:39.160 --> 02:49:41.160]  people that start speaking at city council against
[02:49:41.160 --> 02:49:45.080]  floridation the journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step
[02:49:45.080 --> 02:49:51.320]  and we we need more leaders and more educators to rise up in the system
[02:49:51.320 --> 02:49:54.600]  because we are the majority we have right on our side we have history on our
[02:49:54.600 --> 02:49:57.080]  side and so i would start with a blog i'd start
[02:49:57.080 --> 02:50:00.840]  with a radio blog i'd start with a youtube channel
[02:50:00.840 --> 02:50:03.800]  and just get up there and turn the camera on or if you don't want your face on
[02:50:03.800 --> 02:50:07.640]  tv on the web just put an image up you know a map of
[02:50:07.640 --> 02:50:11.640]  the world or whatever and just talk and i and then put out your email and say i
[02:50:11.640 --> 02:50:14.920]  want to organize with other local people because the globalists can't deal with a
[02:50:14.920 --> 02:50:19.000]  mass of awakened people taking action you don't have to save the world by
[02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:23.080]  yourself it's that resistance that causes victory
[02:50:23.080 --> 02:50:27.080]  right okay and then also my second question is that uh the obama
[02:50:27.080 --> 02:50:31.000]  administration is supposed to be giving like reform legislation
[02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:35.560]  for no child left behind and i did some research on arne sunken who's
[02:50:35.560 --> 02:50:39.960]  the secretary of education and before that he was the ceo of the chicago
[02:50:39.960 --> 02:50:43.560]  public school and you know we all know how that's going right now
[02:50:43.560 --> 02:50:46.520]  it's going well they're really dumbing people down and they're not allowed to
[02:50:46.520 --> 02:50:50.600]  uh have their parents make them lunch but that's what you expect in a prison
[02:50:50.600 --> 02:50:52.760]  system was that your question or your statement
[02:50:52.760 --> 02:50:56.120]  well that's not my opinion just because since arne sunken's secretary of
[02:50:56.120 --> 02:50:58.440]  education how would how would you start going
[02:50:58.440 --> 02:51:03.000]  about okay stay there we'll be right back

[02:52:06.920 --> 02:52:10.920]  is nothing compared to the devastation that could be caused by hyperinflation
[02:52:10.920 --> 02:52:14.760]  that will soon hit the united states and could lead to millions of americans
[02:52:14.760 --> 02:52:18.120]  becoming homeless all caused by the devalued u.s dollar

[02:54:26.200 --> 02:54:30.520]  yeah to the last caller i mean the entire chicago mafia is replacing a lot of
[02:54:30.520 --> 02:54:33.800]  the other dc mob because they're so vicious so evil
[02:54:33.800 --> 02:54:36.840]  they know how to get guns they know how to dump kids down
[02:54:36.840 --> 02:54:41.240]  they know how to shake down business owners they are don carlioni
[02:54:41.240 --> 02:54:45.240]  uh and it's just it's just a total takeover i mean you know in chicago it's
[02:54:45.240 --> 02:54:48.920]  like yeah your parents not gonna be able to bring
[02:54:48.920 --> 02:54:53.480]  not have your kids a lunch we run your kids this slaves to us
[02:54:53.480 --> 02:54:57.320]  and you don't pack a lunch for your kids you buy the lunch
[02:54:57.320 --> 02:55:01.880]  from don carlioni you buy it from mea daily
[02:55:01.880 --> 02:55:06.920]  you understand me prisoner you work for us you live for us you understand that
[02:55:06.920 --> 02:55:09.240]  and now we're going to run the whole country
[02:55:09.240 --> 02:55:12.920]  luan you're on the air from illinois welcome yes yes
[02:55:12.920 --> 02:55:17.160]  hello um i just want to say that uh i live in chicago
[02:55:17.160 --> 02:55:22.520]  and my daughter was in the chicago public school system back in the 1980s
[02:55:22.520 --> 02:55:26.520]  and the same thing that uh that you are talking about today
[02:55:26.520 --> 02:55:31.320]  they were doing back in the 1980s the only difference i see is that they have
[02:55:31.320 --> 02:55:35.000]  come public with it now they are actually telling
