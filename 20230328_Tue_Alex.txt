[00:00.000 --> 00:07.000]  Infowars. Tomorrow's news today. Society is collapsing around us, every form of crime
[00:07.000 --> 00:34.000]  and degeneracy is exploding off the charts, not just in the United States worldwide. We
[00:34.000 --> 00:43.100]  are a fallen civilization and it's only going to get worse. Yesterday as the mass shooting
[00:43.100 --> 00:50.760]  unfolded in Tennessee at a school where darling little children and others were killed, I
[00:50.760 --> 00:54.260]  did not comment on the broadcast other than saying that the shooting had happened because
[00:54.260 --> 01:03.280]  I wanted to give it time to see what unfolded, but Scott the producer walked in right when
[01:03.280 --> 01:09.080]  it happened and he said, how much money you want to bet? This is a transgender person
[01:09.080 --> 01:17.540]  and that's because now about 80% of the time the school shooters are transgender and the
[01:17.540 --> 01:23.400]  media tries to cover it up, but we've got a bunch of the examples here of this happening
[01:23.400 --> 01:28.440]  and they already take quasi autistic people or mentally ill people and they hop them up
[01:28.440 --> 01:34.140]  on a bunch of wild hormones and then they wonder why they have the highest rates of
[01:34.140 --> 01:40.960]  suicide, one of the highest rates of crime out there. I don't hate transgender people.
[01:40.960 --> 01:45.040]  There are a lot of people that are transgender that are really nice like Blair White, who's
[01:45.040 --> 01:52.880]  a very sweet, smart, good person and I think she believes she's a woman and acts like a
[01:52.880 --> 01:57.960]  woman and if she wants to be a woman, she can be a woman. She doesn't want to go compete
[01:57.980 --> 02:05.760]  with women in sports, any of that stuff, but crazed men beating women in sports and women
[02:05.760 --> 02:09.800]  all hopped up on men's hormones, now committing mass shootings. I mean, women never commit
[02:09.800 --> 02:19.600]  mass shootings. In fact, it's never been heard of and now it's happening and these people
[02:19.600 --> 02:29.880]  are incredibly lost and it's really a demonic spirit where they feel led to go kill innocent
[02:29.880 --> 02:34.160]  little children. And that's what happened yesterday and it's just hard to believe this
[02:34.160 --> 02:38.080]  stuff actually happens. It's why I've doubted some of these things before. It's just hard
[02:38.080 --> 02:42.740]  to believe people do it, but you know what? They really do do it, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:42.740 --> 02:46.960]  and our hearts and prayers go out to the parents of so many others. I've got four children,
[02:46.960 --> 02:55.600]  some five and a half, and I just could not imagine what type of twisted, sick brain would
[02:55.600 --> 03:05.440]  want to go and kill little elementary school students. But you notice it's men with guns
[03:05.440 --> 03:13.900]  taking out the crazed woman with the gun and that's why we have guns to protect ourselves
[03:13.900 --> 03:21.380]  and I tell you, when I go to family school events and things and visit, you know, schools
[03:21.380 --> 03:28.620]  where family have children doing performing arts, I don't feel bad when I see police there
[03:28.620 --> 03:36.740]  armed. I feel good. They've never had a concealed carry holder go out and do anything like this.
[03:36.740 --> 03:40.740]  Concealed carry holders have the lowest crime rate of any group in the US, just like the
[03:40.740 --> 03:46.100]  police, and these police did a great job while they're being fired at. They didn't play games.
[03:46.100 --> 03:54.580]  They went there and they killed her while she was shooting at them. So that's what police are
[03:54.580 --> 04:01.060]  supposed to do right there, not like Yuvaldi, where they sat there for 76 minutes putting hand
[04:01.060 --> 04:08.140]  sanitizer on in the hallways. People thought Yuvaldi didn't happen. No, Yuvaldi happened,
[04:08.140 --> 04:14.180]  folks. But people find it hard to believe that police would stand down for 76 minutes. That's
[04:14.180 --> 04:21.140]  even more unbelievable than them staging it. I mean, it's just the incompetence and the bureaucracy
[04:21.140 --> 04:26.980]  of some of these police departments. It's like with the tower shooter back in the 60s. Cops didn't
[04:26.980 --> 04:35.380]  wait. They charged up those stairs and they killed that guy while he shot at him. So the answer is
[04:35.500 --> 04:43.300]  guns in school, especially Christian schools are targets. Tucker Carlson predicted it on last
[04:43.300 --> 04:48.340]  Friday show, or was it Thursday show, where he said the transgenders are arming up and are
[04:48.340 --> 04:52.500]  probably going to start mass shooting people. And now they're announcing International Day of Rage
[04:52.500 --> 04:58.340]  on April 1st, where they're promising to have a violent uprising. And the left, by the way,
[04:58.340 --> 05:04.660]  has been defending the attacker. The fight against the New World Order is now the top story in the
[05:04.660 --> 05:08.980]  world. The globalists are in deep trouble, but they're striking back with all their deep state
[05:08.980 --> 05:14.700]  operatives to shut down Infowars and other truth tellers like James O'Keefe, Tucker Carlson,
[05:14.700 --> 05:18.860]  and countless others. So please pray for us now more than ever. Spread the word about the
[05:18.860 --> 05:23.140]  broadcast and get great products to keep us on air and fund our operation while at the same time

[06:03.180 --> 06:14.300]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[06:14.300 --> 06:30.080]  front lines of the Infowars. Ladies and gentlemen,
[06:30.080 --> 06:43.480]  transgenderism is a Tabistock Institute MI6 CIA creation to launch the transhumanist movement.
[06:43.480 --> 06:48.560]  Because if you'll accept a man being a woman, a woman being a man, if you'll accept two men
[06:48.560 --> 06:56.920]  having a baby when it's two women or a man and a woman, if you will accept that, you'll accept
[06:57.240 --> 07:01.880]  chimeric humanoids that are made out of three or four dads, or two or three moms,
[07:01.880 --> 07:06.680]  or a mix of other people which they're now producing and making for decades in test tubes,
[07:06.680 --> 07:14.440]  you'll accept the entire globalist agenda. I do not hate people that are trans. I do not
[07:14.440 --> 07:21.360]  think that the average person that is living like that is a mass shooter or a bad person.
[07:21.360 --> 07:29.960]  That said, the entire movement is a synthetic creation for depopulation and to totally confuse
[07:29.960 --> 07:35.160]  society and break up the family, and that's admitted. And the same leftist movement worldwide,
[07:35.160 --> 07:42.400]  funded by the big corporations that force feed this, are openly saying now they want
[07:42.400 --> 07:48.680]  to euthanize children without parental consent. So it's all about killing people. And if you
[07:48.680 --> 07:53.520]  can't sell killing babies out of the womb, well you just call it a transgender surgery
[07:53.520 --> 08:00.520]  and cut their breasts and their genitals off. And then you get people caught up in this cult,
[08:00.520 --> 08:05.680]  caught up in this is your identity, this is why you're confused, take these hormones,
[08:05.680 --> 08:11.200]  do this, and then statistically they are the most unhappy, suicide-prone people everywhere,
[08:11.200 --> 08:18.320]  anywhere, and we're told it's because you're not celebrating them. You're not accepting them.
[08:18.680 --> 08:22.920]  Why they went on this wonderful path at the public school or the system put them on,
[08:22.920 --> 08:27.360]  in some cases when they were two years old, now the trans cult says they know when a child's
[08:27.360 --> 08:34.600]  born at birth that they're trans. Well, it's not the fault of the system creating this nightmare.
[08:34.600 --> 08:42.360]  No, no, it's your fault for not worshipping it and rolling out a red carpet to it. So let's be
[08:42.360 --> 08:49.560]  clear, where I don't blame the average transgender person or say they're a bad person or judge them,
[08:49.560 --> 09:02.080]  the big think tanks, the intelligence agencies, the transhumanist Julian Huxley combine is the
[09:02.080 --> 09:06.920]  group running this, their fingerprints are all over it, they're the authors of it, they admit
[09:06.960 --> 09:13.800]  they run the whole thing, and it's the leading edge of the wedge to bring in transhumanists,
[09:13.800 --> 09:21.280]  humanoid, cyborg, future that we're being told is the future and that the future isn't human by all
[09:21.280 --> 09:26.480]  the high priests of the globalist system. Now that said, we're going to drill into what happened in
[09:26.480 --> 09:32.560]  Tennessee yesterday and the announcements all over Instagram, all over Twitter, all over Facebook,
[09:32.560 --> 09:38.280]  all over everywhere, of saying, well, this is what you deserve. I've got the articles and
[09:38.280 --> 09:43.280]  pronounce right here, because you were mean to the transgenders in Tennessee's passing a law
[09:43.280 --> 09:50.840]  saying you can't sterilize little children. So because there's this horrible abuse, the trans
[09:50.840 --> 09:58.960]  communities being weaponized by the deep state, by the Twittersphere, to now believe that violence
[09:58.960 --> 10:03.440]  is the answer and you see it everywhere, them calling for the death of JK Rowling for saying
[10:03.440 --> 10:09.040]  biological women are biological women and women's sports are women's sports and a bunch of footage
[10:09.040 --> 10:13.760]  I didn't get to yesterday of Alex Stein being physically attacked at one of these cult events
[10:13.760 --> 10:20.600]  that he went to, and a big activist who's very well-spoken and non-violent in New Zealand being
[10:20.600 --> 10:26.600]  physically attacked and barely making it out of their lives yesterday, or I guess now two days
[10:26.600 --> 10:33.320]  ago, and if there's drag queen story time with little children being taken, we're half naked men
[10:33.320 --> 10:39.680]  dressed like clowns, shake their genitals at children, they're all out there with their AR-15s
[10:39.680 --> 10:44.240]  and they're not just there with their guns, they tell you, we're going to kill you, we hope you
[10:44.240 --> 10:57.080]  die. So they are completely whacked out, many of them, and there's a pedophilic vein that runs
[10:57.080 --> 11:06.240]  through the center of the entire mess because it's bigger than just wanting to sterilize children,
[11:06.240 --> 11:12.760]  it's about the spiritual energy in and around the destruction of a child's future and or a
[11:12.800 --> 11:21.760]  child's life. And this whole thing has a hunger to go out to Christian churches and Christian
[11:21.760 --> 11:28.320]  schools and murder Christians and murder children. So the trans cult is about murdering the future
[11:28.320 --> 11:35.080]  of a child, murdering their fertility, murdering their body parts, having giant fat men dance
[11:35.240 --> 11:42.960]  around naked in front of children. The giant, obscene, disgusting cult at the top with a bunch
[11:42.960 --> 11:49.000]  of brainwashed lemmings at the bottom in the middle, including, and I've had members of
[11:49.000 --> 11:54.320]  parliament on from the UK about this a decade ago, the majority in the UK of transgender children
[11:54.320 --> 12:01.800]  are autistic. And if you cover the drag queen times and the drag queen pedo times, like we
[12:01.800 --> 12:06.400]  have, you notice that the women look like, that are there bringing their children, look like
[12:06.400 --> 12:11.360]  they're mutants. And I'm not trying to be mean, they just all look like they're dying. And their
[12:11.360 --> 12:19.680]  children are almost all completely... And it's very sad, but they're howling, they're barking
[12:19.680 --> 12:26.920]  at the moon, they're chirping, they're flappy-handsing, all the classic autistic stuff.
[12:26.920 --> 12:30.840]  There's even kids there with football helmets on, you know, they're bumping their head into the
[12:30.880 --> 12:35.640]  ground and they're just rolling them in like, here's where you're loved, here's where you're
[12:35.640 --> 12:41.880]  accepted, here's some fat men dressed like it and a clown, many of them convicted pedophiles.
[12:41.880 --> 12:51.400]  And this is just the army of evil rolling forward. So just six, seven years ago, the big thing was
[12:51.400 --> 12:58.160]  just give us gay marriage and that's all we want. And now they attach to gay marriage and gay men,
[12:58.160 --> 13:08.760]  men dressed up like clowns, sexualizing children, scantily clad and cutting little girls' breasts
[13:08.760 --> 13:15.480]  off, little boys' penises off. I mean, this is a real cult, but they got the bandwagon going,
[13:15.480 --> 13:22.920]  you see, and now it's bestiality, now it's Satanism, now it's a culture that has the
[13:22.920 --> 13:31.240]  bottom falling out of it. And so there's all these calls here for the International
[13:31.240 --> 13:41.960]  Day of Rage of the Trans People. And men that think they're women and women that think they're
[13:41.960 --> 13:51.600]  men out with sandwich boards with images of rifles saying trans rights or else. And the
[13:51.800 --> 13:58.440]  main trans resistance movement came out and said, the shooter's a victim too, you made him do it.
[13:58.440 --> 14:13.360]  When it's a her. Nobody is coming to save us. International Day of Rage and Violence coming up
[14:13.600 --> 14:21.120]  April 1st, and it's an image of a trans person with an AR-15. Nobody's going to save them. Why?
[14:21.120 --> 14:25.920]  The state isn't getting access to children to sterilize them. They're putting up a little bit
[14:25.920 --> 14:32.200]  of a fight. So the answer is let's go out and get violent. Here's a breakdown. Notice a pattern.
[14:32.200 --> 14:39.640]  Colorado Springs shooter identifies as non-binary. Denver shooter identified as trans. The Evaldi
[14:39.640 --> 14:44.840]  shooter was into that too. Aberdeen shooter identifies as trans. Nashville shooter identified
[14:44.840 --> 14:54.740]  as trans. Confused, freaked out, whacked out people on major, major, major hormones. And you know,
[14:54.740 --> 14:58.440]  I've talked to a lot of medical doctors about this over the years, and they make the point that,
[14:58.440 --> 15:04.520]  you know, the group that gets divorces the most often in married couples, statistically,
[15:04.840 --> 15:13.280]  is people doing hormone therapy to try to get pregnant. A 45 year old woman trying to get
[15:13.280 --> 15:16.320]  pregnant, they have to put them on a bunch of hormones to get them jacked up to do it,
[15:16.320 --> 15:21.520]  and they go crazy. And I've known people that tried to get pregnant and did get pregnant.
[15:21.520 --> 15:27.920]  Some one person I know had twins out of it, but they barely maintain their marriage in just the
[15:27.920 --> 15:33.680]  six months they were trying to get pregnant because they were on all these hormones. Man,
[15:33.840 --> 15:38.480]  I mean, wow. I remember being like 13, being in hardcore puberty, hit when I was about 10,
[15:38.480 --> 15:46.480]  actually, but really virile about 13. And man, I mean, I was just vicious. I mean,
[15:46.480 --> 15:51.960]  it came in strong, hard, and it was super masculine, and I was just like meaner than
[15:51.960 --> 15:57.880]  hell. And I learned to control it over the years, but imagine giving a woman a bunch of injections
[15:57.880 --> 15:58.600]  of that stuff.
[16:27.880 --> 16:31.480]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys have been awake for like decades.
[16:31.480 --> 16:38.200]  Alex Jones called this years ago, years ago. Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax. Not
[16:38.200 --> 16:44.600]  for a second. You are one of the great thinkers of this. You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[16:44.600 --> 16:49.640]  The government fears Alex Jones. That's why the globalists hate me,
[16:49.640 --> 16:52.840]  is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[16:57.880 --> 17:05.720]  I'm a huge believer in information. I watch Infowars every day and follow Alex Jones closer.
[17:05.720 --> 17:10.520]  You know why? He can put you ahead of the curve, and he's been demonized as a conspiracy theorist.
[17:10.520 --> 17:15.920]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two. Imagine being like an
[17:15.920 --> 17:22.640]  Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades. Alex has been right on for over a
[17:22.800 --> 17:30.160]  decade. This is reality. It just can't be. Truth is stranger than fiction. The revolution of peaceful
[17:30.160 --> 17:33.840]  information is coming, and when it comes time, you people are going to be brought to promise.
[17:33.840 --> 17:39.520]  You're lying to the public. It's disgusting. The media continues to misrepresent what I've said.
[17:39.520 --> 17:45.680]  He may be America's best known conspiracy theorist. Alex Jones has the largest audience in the
[17:45.680 --> 17:50.720]  country, bigger than any of the networks, the biggest megaphone in the country. We're going
[17:50.720 --> 17:53.760]  to get fired up about the real things, the things that matter.
[17:58.320 --> 17:59.520]  Burn in hell, New World Order.
[18:02.000 --> 18:08.160]  Humanity is in a fight for its very life, and Infowars for decades has been at the very
[18:08.160 --> 18:13.360]  forefront of the fight for a pro-human future. We can't stay on air without your help,
[18:13.360 --> 18:16.480]  and I want to thank you all for your past support, and I want to encourage those of
[18:16.480 --> 18:20.720]  you that have never bought products at Infowarsstore.com to go there and experience
[18:20.720 --> 18:25.840]  how amazing these products really are. Ultimate Bone Broth finally sold out for over two years
[18:25.840 --> 18:32.080]  back in stock. Real Red Pill Plus, simply amazing. Nitric Boost, what it does for your heart,
[18:32.080 --> 18:36.720]  cardiovascular, critical. All these products, like Ultimate Krill Oil, Ultimate Fish Oil,
[18:36.720 --> 18:40.880]  Supermell Vitality, they're all available and in stock, ready to ship to you right now on
[18:40.880 --> 18:46.160]  Infowarsstore.com. And the final 1,200 signed copies of my book, The Great Reset and War for
[18:46.160 --> 18:50.640]  the World, I'm not going to sign any more after that, are exclusively available at Infowarsstore.com
[18:50.640 --> 18:54.000]  as well. In the last month I got a little busy, so I didn't sign the books, we didn't have them
[18:54.000 --> 19:02.960]  for sale, but now I sign the last books and get them right now. I talk a lot about the great
[19:02.960 --> 19:09.120]  successes Infowars has had. I don't think anybody can deny it, and it is because of listeners and
[19:09.120 --> 19:13.600]  viewers supporting us. When we talk about the crew at Infowars, people behind the scenes,
[19:13.600 --> 19:20.080]  the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight. And when you look
[19:20.080 --> 19:24.880]  at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six,
[19:24.880 --> 19:30.240]  seven days a week, it's really just incredible. So for myself and the whole Infowars crew,
[19:30.240 --> 19:35.360]  I thank you for your past support. I only encourage you now to realize that Infowars
[19:35.360 --> 19:39.840]  cannot stay on air if you do not support us. I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us,
[19:39.840 --> 19:43.520]  and that's wonderful, keep doing it. But most viewers and listeners never go to
[19:43.520 --> 19:48.000]  Infowarsstore.com and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life,
[19:48.000 --> 19:52.400]  while at the same time keep us on air. I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy
[19:52.400 --> 19:57.760]  products at Infowarsstore.com. If just 1% more of you took action and went to Infowarsstore.com,
[19:57.760 --> 20:00.160]  our funding problems will be over. Please take action now.
[20:00.960 --> 20:06.960]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:09.840 --> 20:26.320]  There is no bigger story in the world than the transhumanist cult.
[20:27.680 --> 20:33.440]  And only a small branch of it is the quote trans movement, but it's the leading edge of it.
[20:34.560 --> 20:38.960]  And that's in the globalist owned admissions. We played countless clips of Harari and
[20:38.960 --> 20:42.400]  Klaus Schwab and all the rest of them talking about this, and as they put more and more
[20:42.400 --> 20:47.280]  chemicals in the food and water, as they confuse the hormonal systems of humans and animals,
[20:48.000 --> 20:52.320]  we're only going to see these problems intensify. So I want to be clear, the population or victims,
[20:53.760 --> 21:00.560]  we're all being targeted with forget stuff that sterilizes you. How about 5G and
[21:01.120 --> 21:07.040]  the rest of it that gives you cancer? The fertility's plunged, the cancer rates are
[21:07.040 --> 21:15.040]  exploding. Society is collapsing all around us and it's being done by design in this giant
[21:15.040 --> 21:20.080]  pressure cooker. Now we played the clips many times, I'm not going to play them again,
[21:20.080 --> 21:24.640]  but the different universities rubbing their hands together, the university medical center is going,
[21:24.640 --> 21:31.040]  we make $40,000 cutting a girl's breast off. We make $30,000 cutting a little boy's penis off.
[21:32.960 --> 21:34.480]  It's our biggest growth industry.
[21:37.680 --> 21:44.160]  And they're convincing young children that they're another sex, they put them in a file,
[21:44.160 --> 21:49.360]  they put them on a fast track for destruction, and then now the numbers are exploding everywhere
[21:49.360 --> 21:53.680]  because there's all these alone, confused people that play video games all day and are on a bunch
[21:53.680 --> 21:57.680]  of different psychotropic drugs who don't have an identity because they're not outside hiking,
[21:57.680 --> 22:01.040]  they're not working in the fields, they're not learning things, they're not playing sports.
[22:01.840 --> 22:08.640]  We all know who's being typecast for this and they take these really abused, hurt little children
[22:09.840 --> 22:15.840]  and they throw them in the deep fryer of the transgender cult and then they're pissed off.
[22:15.840 --> 22:21.280]  Hey man, it's the Christian school I went to, that's why I'm so unhappy. They didn't recognize
[22:22.880 --> 22:28.640]  that I was really a man and so I'm going to go in there with my transgender manifesto
[22:28.880 --> 22:33.120]  and we now have the comments from Audrey Hale, this totally confused young woman
[22:33.840 --> 22:40.640]  who went by Aiden, all dressed up in her man's outfit and doing what she thinks men do.
[22:40.640 --> 22:46.960]  Why men go and they mass shoot. Never before had a woman do a mass shooting, have we?
[22:50.000 --> 22:55.920]  Saying this is the end of my life, this is not a joke. So basically this post I made on here
[22:55.920 --> 23:02.880]  about you, this was basically a suicide note. I'm planning to die today, this is not a joke.
[23:03.440 --> 23:06.560]  You'll probably hear about me on the news after I die.
[23:08.320 --> 23:11.680]  This is my last goodbye, I love you, see you again another life.
[23:14.720 --> 23:18.960]  Audrey slash Aiden.
[23:19.920 --> 23:26.960]  Audrey, they go on to say, you've got so much to live for, don't kill yourself
[23:27.680 --> 23:36.960]  and it just goes on from there. Audrey, you have so much more life to live. I pray God keeps you
[23:37.520 --> 23:44.400]  and covers you. I know but I don't want to live. I'm so sorry, I'm not trying to upset you or get
[23:44.400 --> 23:50.320]  attention. I just need to die. And this person thought the way to die is to go kill little kids.
[23:51.040 --> 23:55.280]  I want to tell you first because you are the most beautiful person I've ever seen
[23:55.280 --> 24:01.040]  and known my whole life. My family doesn't know what I'm about to do. One day this will
[24:01.040 --> 24:06.160]  make more sense. I've left more than enough evidence behind, but something bad is about to
[24:06.160 --> 24:13.440]  happen. And as they hype the mass shootings, they will increase and they will get worse because
[24:13.440 --> 24:18.960]  mentally ill people are now taught, you don't just become transgender, you go out and you shoot
[24:18.960 --> 24:26.560]  and you kill people. And now the majority of mass shooters that are technically the totally senseless
[24:26.560 --> 24:31.440]  type is the FBI averages in gang shootings that are at schools then says, well, half of them are
[24:32.000 --> 24:35.840]  black on black or black on Hispanic or Hispanic on Hispanic.
[24:35.840 --> 24:38.320]  But if you take those out that are gang shootings
[24:38.320 --> 24:48.480]  and you just have raw going to school, shoot a bunch of kids, this is it. And they fight to
[24:48.480 --> 24:59.360]  hide that. But these are the incredibly unhappy, depressed, demonically brainwashed. I mean,
[24:59.360 --> 25:08.000]  I don't know what term we should really use to break it down, but we have a lower animal brain
[25:08.800 --> 25:19.040]  that deals with fighting and sex. All of the lower instincts and people are on so many complex
[25:19.040 --> 25:26.480]  hardcore drugs now. And almost all these mass shooters are on these drugs and the system knows
[25:26.480 --> 25:30.640]  that there's inserts on the Prozac of that whole family of drugs that it causes mass murder.
[25:30.640 --> 25:34.160]  I wanted to show this video last Friday saying here's the spirit of the new world order
[25:34.800 --> 25:38.480]  of a young lady. It looks like she's on steroids or something,
[25:39.280 --> 25:46.000]  totally crazed, smoking out of a vape pen, acting completely demonically possessed.
[25:49.520 --> 25:52.160]  But when you see that, ladies and gentlemen, that's the face
[25:53.040 --> 26:01.360]  of the wavelength these people have dialed into. And it's a spirit of selfishness,
[26:01.360 --> 26:08.480]  a spirit of hatred. It's a demonic spirit.
[26:12.640 --> 26:18.000]  And that's what hardcore drugs does to you. And look at the tattoo on her chest of a big demon.
[26:24.480 --> 26:27.200]  And that, my friends, is why we have guns.
[26:27.200 --> 26:35.840]  So that when these whacked out devils, former humans that fell to Satan, come to hurt us and
[26:35.840 --> 26:42.160]  come to hurt our children like a moth to flame, we can protect the children like the police officers
[26:42.160 --> 26:50.240]  did. Let's go ahead and roll the footage again of them taking this young, disturbed, taken over
[26:50.320 --> 26:58.160]  person out and understand it is good people with guns that stopped this monster before she was able
[26:58.160 --> 27:03.040]  to kill even more people. And notice we are misgendering her because we misgender on purpose.
[27:03.040 --> 27:07.760]  Now, the real gender, she's a woman hopped up on a bunch of hormones and drugs
[27:09.600 --> 27:15.280]  who fell to the dark side. Here's the video.
[27:20.240 --> 27:23.280]  Sounds like it's upstairs.
[27:33.840 --> 27:40.240]  Now, our private public schools sound like submarines diving in an emergency dive with
[27:42.000 --> 27:43.440]  depth charges being dropped on them
[27:46.240 --> 27:48.480]  because the schools are now targets of the devil.
[27:50.240 --> 28:00.880]  The officers did their job. They charged in to save the children while the woman fired at them.
[28:03.200 --> 28:07.760]  And I got to tell you, I'm not glad that the killer's dead. I wish that they would have
[28:07.760 --> 28:12.320]  fallen to Satan. But there's a real sense of satisfaction knowing that she was unable to
[28:12.320 --> 28:18.640]  kill more people. And it was the Second Amendment that stopped this monster, that planned this out
[28:18.640 --> 28:23.120]  reportedly, according to the police, for months. It was going to hit another school but didn't
[28:23.120 --> 28:30.720]  hit it because they had too much security. But this is a lesson. Locks on a door are
[28:30.720 --> 28:38.960]  not what protected the children. It was guns. Though, Audrey Hale, aka Aiden Hale,
[28:40.320 --> 28:45.920]  was able to kill children. We'll talk about those children coming up. But first,
[28:45.920 --> 28:50.560]  Tucker Carlson predicted it last Friday. He was attacked for it. And now he's completely
[28:50.560 --> 28:56.720]  vindicated. And this cult says they're going to launch massive attacks on April 1 across
[28:56.720 --> 29:03.120]  the world against anyone keeping them away from the truth. Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new
[29:03.120 --> 29:08.880]  toothpaste that my dad, a retired dentist and oral surgeon, developed. Dr. Jones Natural's Tumor
[29:08.880 --> 29:13.760]  toothpaste that just came into stock. And I got to tell you, I got samples of this months ago,
[29:13.760 --> 29:17.760]  and it is amazing. The way it makes your gums feel, what it does to your mouth,
[29:17.760 --> 29:22.880]  is insane. We know turmeric is an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory and does such great things
[29:22.880 --> 29:26.960]  for the body. Then you add that with tea tree oil and a bunch of other essential oils,
[29:26.960 --> 29:33.120]  it is just dynamite. It is so good to detox and attack inflammation in your mouth. I want to
[29:33.120 --> 29:39.040]  challenge everybody to try the new toothpaste at mfootworkstore.com. Dr. Jones Natural's Tumor
[29:39.040 --> 29:43.280]  toothpaste. And while you're at it, check out the new ashwagandha line of products. We have

[30:07.680 --> 30:10.480]  And he's been demonized as a conspiracy theorist.
[30:11.280 --> 30:14.800]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[30:14.800 --> 30:18.320]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[30:20.240 --> 30:24.640]  Alex has been right on for over a decade. This is reality.
[30:24.640 --> 30:28.880]  It just can't be. Truth is stranger than fiction.
[30:28.880 --> 30:32.240]  The revolution of peaceful information is coming. And when it comes time,
[30:32.240 --> 30:36.000]  you people are going to be brought to punish. You're lying to the public. It's disgusting.
[30:36.000 --> 30:42.000]  The media continues to misrepresent what I've said. He may be America's best known conspiracy
[30:42.000 --> 30:48.320]  theorist. Alex Jones has the largest audience in the country, bigger than any of the networks,
[30:48.320 --> 30:52.640]  the biggest megaphone in the country. We're going to get fired up about the real thing,

[33:02.720 --> 33:16.400]  on the lies of the new world order. It's Alex Jones.
[33:24.320 --> 33:32.320]  From the front lines of the information war. It's Alex Jones. The stated goal of the mega
[33:32.400 --> 33:40.400]  corporations and the giant private foundations that control them is ending the human family as
[33:40.400 --> 33:46.800]  we know it and making us atomized dependent corporate products that they own. They want
[33:46.800 --> 33:53.680]  to sell us on accepting humanoids, human animal cross species, all this garbage everywhere that
[33:53.680 --> 33:59.920]  they've been developing in the dark and they're now rolling out. And the first thing to destabilize us
[34:00.720 --> 34:06.560]  was to break up the family, demonize the role of men, attack masculinity, attack true femininity,
[34:07.120 --> 34:13.200]  and then bring forward the transgender cult, who again are unhappy and depressed and committing
[34:13.200 --> 34:18.240]  suicide because they're in the jaws of this meat grinder. And then the system goes, look,
[34:18.240 --> 34:24.640]  you're unhappy because they're not accepting you. And the more we try to accept,
[34:24.640 --> 34:31.120]  the more we feed our children into this meat grinder, why the more we've got to do,
[34:31.120 --> 34:35.040]  the more we've got to comply, the more we've got to jump through hoops. Because after all,
[34:35.040 --> 34:44.240]  you want these people to be happy, don't you? The great society and the letters are public. You can
[34:44.240 --> 34:50.880]  look them up. LBJ's letters in the great society using the N word. He talked about, well, these
[34:50.880 --> 34:55.600]  black people are getting too uppity, use the N word. They got their own hotels, their own
[34:55.600 --> 35:00.640]  businesses, they're wealthy, their own doctors. I'm not for segregation, but that which doesn't
[35:00.640 --> 35:04.720]  kill you makes you stronger. So blacks on average had about the same illegitimacy rate as whites,
[35:04.720 --> 35:09.520]  maybe lower in some areas. They were becoming extremely wealthy on average.
[35:11.360 --> 35:14.720]  They own their own clothiers, they own their own manufacturing facilities.
[35:14.720 --> 35:25.040]  And LBJ said, we're going to pay the black women not to have men in the house,
[35:25.040 --> 35:29.360]  we're going to incentivize them to have a bunch of kids. We're going to have them under our thumb.
[35:30.800 --> 35:34.160]  And we'll have those N words voting Democrat for the next 100 years.
[35:36.880 --> 35:44.080]  Now that's some mid 1960s. Sorry, he said 200 years. That's some 1960s brainwashing right there.
[35:44.720 --> 35:51.360]  So if you think breaking up the black family did some horrible stuff,
[35:52.880 --> 35:57.760]  and the other families are all breaking up now too, we have the most illegitimate country in
[35:57.760 --> 36:01.680]  the world when it comes to single parents, not attacking hardworking single parents, I get it.
[36:01.680 --> 36:06.560]  Society's in trouble. But your child's three to five times more likely to end up on drugs
[36:06.560 --> 36:12.960]  in prison or dead. Why would the system want that? Why would they not want fathers in the home?
[36:14.800 --> 36:25.840]  But because you see what you get, then the state's got to step in with full absolute control.
[36:29.600 --> 36:36.400]  So this is a planned operation. Now that said, Alex Stein's coming on next hour to talk about
[36:36.400 --> 36:40.480]  this. He just got attacked over the weekend going to one of these events, because these are
[36:40.480 --> 36:47.040]  entitled hateful people on average that are the activists that really usually aren't even trans.
[36:47.600 --> 36:54.720]  Their main thing is access to children. And there is a always huge pedophilic vibe in the air.
[36:58.800 --> 37:02.240]  Everybody's seen Hollywood movies that cast what pedophiles look like.
[37:03.120 --> 37:06.880]  I always describe Brian Stelter looking about as pedophiles you can get. I'm not saying he's a
[37:06.880 --> 37:10.720]  pedophile. I'm saying if I was going to cast somebody as a pedophile for a movie, I'd cast him.
[37:13.920 --> 37:17.200]  Just like they cast Christian Bale, the American Psycho.
[37:18.720 --> 37:24.560]  Step aside, here comes Governor Newsom, the real deal. Everybody knows what a real silver tongue
[37:24.560 --> 37:30.240]  psycho looks like. Everybody knows what a pedo looks like. Everybody knows these archetypes.
[37:31.440 --> 37:35.040]  You got instincts, you got a soul, you got guts, you got a brain, you know.
[37:35.040 --> 37:43.200]  And all the trans talk about violence, if you keep killing us and making us commit suicide,
[37:43.840 --> 37:47.360]  because you don't accept us when we're like, you can do whatever you want,
[37:47.360 --> 37:50.480]  paint your hair however you want, have sex with whoever you want, as long as they're a consenting
[37:50.480 --> 37:55.280]  adult. You think I'm actually running around thinking about trans people all day or hating
[37:55.280 --> 38:05.600]  them? No, I'm not. I'm a live and let live guy. But in the roaring 20s in Germany, they had the
[38:05.600 --> 38:11.040]  transgender movement that spread worldwide from there. That picked up later in the 60s by British
[38:11.040 --> 38:17.600]  intelligence. And it is the hallmark of a society before it collapses. And the system knows this,
[38:17.600 --> 38:22.400]  so they've accelerated it. In the 60s and 70s, they did the famous rat studies, where they would
[38:22.400 --> 38:25.840]  have contained cities of rats and give them all the food and all the water they wanted.
[38:26.400 --> 38:34.480]  And within three generations, the males become trans and the females become the bosses. And then
[38:34.480 --> 38:41.840]  within another generation, they all just start eating each other or committing suicide. And then
[38:41.840 --> 38:48.240]  within about eight generations, there are no rats left. We've done whole shows on that. Look up the
[38:48.240 --> 38:58.000]  famous rat colony collapse studies. So they're accelerating colony collapse. And that's what
[38:58.000 --> 39:03.360]  this is. And they've greased the skins with the chemicals and the cultural brainwashing. And we
[39:03.360 --> 39:11.600]  have to be smarter than rats and recognize this is being done to us and not just get sucked into
[39:11.760 --> 39:19.120]  hating the victims of this, but reaching out to them and explaining what's been done to them.
[39:19.840 --> 39:23.600]  And some are so far gone, you're not going to reach out to them. But the corporations
[39:23.600 --> 39:27.680]  and the insurance companies and the medical facilities and the intelligence agencies,
[39:29.520 --> 39:36.960]  they are the real culprits in this scenario.
[39:36.960 --> 39:44.640]  And they know exactly what they're doing. And they are playing mad scientist God.
[39:45.840 --> 39:48.800]  So here's what I want to announce and say.
[39:51.440 --> 39:57.120]  The obvious cause and effect of this is going to be another disturbed but angry,
[39:57.120 --> 40:02.560]  pissed off person is going to go to a drag queen story time or one of these trans
[40:03.520 --> 40:07.120]  rallies they have everywhere. And it's going to shoot a bunch of these people.
[40:09.280 --> 40:11.440]  That is the last thing that needs to happen.
[40:15.600 --> 40:18.240]  And we need to upfront say we do not want that.
[40:19.120 --> 40:22.320]  People are going to want to avenge these dead kids and other Christians.
[40:22.320 --> 40:27.840]  Christians are being targeted. But there's a time to turn the other cheek.
[40:28.800 --> 40:34.720]  And the trans cult minions and gremlins of the system should not be harmed.
[40:35.440 --> 40:39.120]  They should be arrested if they hurt children or get caught doing pedophilia or any of that.
[40:39.120 --> 40:41.360]  We should pass laws. They can't target children.
[40:42.320 --> 40:49.040]  But we do not need anybody to go attack one of these events or attack any transgender person.
[40:49.920 --> 40:52.720]  And let me go further. I'm not calling for violence.
[40:52.720 --> 41:00.000]  But if you want to know who does all this and who created all this, the history of it's on record.
[41:02.000 --> 41:09.040]  So I want to target those groups by exposing them and call for legal action against them.
[41:10.880 --> 41:15.360]  The big hospitals that push these surgeries, the Tabestock Institute, all the different
[41:15.360 --> 41:20.400]  leftist groups, Hollywood, Disney that are funding it, withdraw your money from these people.
[41:20.960 --> 41:25.280]  And if you want to know who the enemy is, it's those engineers, the cultural engineers
[41:25.920 --> 41:30.240]  on the top that are doing all this. And they're the ones that are the enemy.
[41:31.280 --> 41:36.400]  Not when you go to one of these pathetic events and there is a bunch of zombie looking
[41:36.400 --> 41:43.840]  crazy people that look like they have been put in a mutation chamber, howling and screaming
[41:43.840 --> 41:48.880]  and running around foaming at the mouth. I mean, those are people that we lost to the enemy.
[41:50.480 --> 41:54.720]  Doesn't mean we don't protect the children from them. Doesn't mean we don't stay far back from.
[41:58.960 --> 42:01.600]  But they are just the zombies that fell to the enemy.
[42:02.960 --> 42:10.400]  It is the dark globalist alchemist of evil and their science of human destruction that is the
[42:10.400 --> 42:19.040]  fount, the fountain, the heart, the headwater, the progenitor, the general, the commander,
[42:19.040 --> 42:26.080]  the master, the king, the field marshal, the head honcho, the El Jefe,
[42:29.440 --> 42:36.240]  that is running all this. We better identify it because the next wave is coming.
[42:36.800 --> 42:42.880]  Government forced suicide on children as a right. All right, we're going to come back with
[42:42.880 --> 42:47.440]  Tucker Carlson predicting it all. And then I got another huge story here that we haven't
[42:47.440 --> 42:52.560]  hit that is just as big as this is important. It all ties together. The TikTok legislation.
[42:55.760 --> 42:56.720]  Wait till you hear this.
[43:00.720 --> 43:05.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new toothpaste that my dad, a retired dentist and oral surgeon
[43:05.760 --> 43:12.480]  developed. Dr. Jones, natural tumor toothpaste that just came into stock. And I got to tell you,
[43:12.480 --> 43:16.560]  I got samples of this months ago and it is amazing the way it makes your gums feel what
[43:16.560 --> 43:22.160]  it does to your mouth is insane. We know turmeric is an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory.
[43:22.160 --> 43:25.920]  It does such great things to the body. Then you add that with tea tree oil and a bunch of other
[43:25.920 --> 43:32.880]  essential oils. It is just dynamite. It is so good to detox and attack inflammation in your mouth.
[43:32.880 --> 43:37.200]  I want to challenge everybody to try the new toothpaste at mfoolworthstore.com.
[43:37.200 --> 43:42.560]  Dr. Jones, natural turmeric toothpaste. And while you're at it, check out the new ashwagandha line

[44:00.720 --> 44:05.760]  Thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United States government. A flying disc
[44:05.760 --> 44:10.960]  has been found and is now in the possession of the army. There is a bulletin from CBS news.
[44:10.960 --> 44:18.160]  President Kennedy has been shot. This is a different kind of war. The USS Liberty had
[44:18.160 --> 44:23.600]  just been attacked by Israeli jets and torpedo boats. The CIA could manipulate the news in the
[44:23.600 --> 44:27.760]  United States. They took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on
[44:27.760 --> 44:34.160]  a cold bus. It was almost as if there were a plan in place. It just happened. We need to go into the
[44:34.160 --> 44:40.960]  Capitol. You will always have conspiracy theories. They are nothing but distractions. You guys
[44:40.960 --> 44:46.880]  censored Harvard educated doctors. You silenced those voices. What we want to do in Davos is
[44:46.880 --> 44:53.120]  push the reset button. As soon as we start exposing the great reset, the sooner these
[44:53.120 --> 45:08.240]  globalists start going to prison. This is their big move. So yeah, you say, why doesn't Biden
[45:08.240 --> 45:13.760]  address the disasters in the United States? He doesn't care. That's not his job. He's not the
[45:13.760 --> 45:19.680]  president of the United States. He's a puppet operating for the globalists. Appetites of the
[45:19.680 --> 45:27.840]  autocrat cannot be appeased. They must be opposed. And that's only to understand one word.
[45:28.480 --> 45:37.840]  No, no, no. Exactly. And that's why we say no to your vaccines. We say no to you shutting down
[45:37.840 --> 45:43.280]  our businesses. We say no to you taking our firearms. We say no to you censoring our free
[45:43.280 --> 45:48.480]  speech. We say no to you selling us out to the World Health Organization. We say no to you
[45:48.480 --> 45:53.520]  getting us into World War Three. You're right. We stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden,
[45:53.520 --> 45:57.040]  and we say no, and we say no to your war.
[46:18.480 --> 46:25.840]  Alex has been right on toward over a decade. This is reality. It just
[46:25.840 --> 46:31.280]  pancakes. Truth is stranger than fiction. The revolution of peaceful information is coming.
[46:31.280 --> 46:35.200]  And when it comes time, you people are going to be brought to promise. You're lying to the public.
[46:35.200 --> 46:40.240]  It's disgusting. The media continues to misrepresent what I've said. He may be
[46:40.240 --> 46:46.560]  America's best known conspiracy theorist. Alex Jones has the largest audience in the country
[46:46.560 --> 46:50.720]  bigger than any of the networks, the biggest megaphone in the country.
[46:50.720 --> 46:54.000]  We're going to get fired up about the real thing, the things that matter.
[46:58.560 --> 46:59.760]  Burn in hell, New World Order.
[47:01.200 --> 47:07.200]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:16.560 --> 47:24.080]  All right.
[47:29.280 --> 47:38.720]  We now have the main legislation that is bipartisan in Congress. Bill 686, the restrict act
[47:40.080 --> 47:45.920]  that is so incredible. When I saw this today and I knew they were trying to pass legislation like
[47:45.920 --> 47:52.240]  this in the past, but this looks like it may actually go through. It's just mind blowing.
[47:53.120 --> 47:58.880]  So we'll hit this more next hour, but it allows the US government to do what they say the Chinese
[47:58.880 --> 48:05.600]  are doing through TikTok to protect you. It allows them with the smart meters and the 5G to take over
[48:05.600 --> 48:11.840]  all your devices and basically control everything in your house and surveil and censor everything
[48:11.840 --> 48:18.960]  and shut off any devices they want. So this is beyond the government doing search warrants or
[48:20.320 --> 48:23.040]  ordering big tech to censor people.
[48:25.200 --> 48:29.520]  This is taking control of the devices themselves, which only AI could do
[48:31.600 --> 48:37.600]  in the name of protecting us from the Chinese who are doing it with their 5G. So, oh,
[48:37.600 --> 48:40.960]  we're not going to let them do this to you. We're going to just take everything over.
[48:42.800 --> 48:47.120]  Which has all been part of the plan, all these devices for decades in all the new
[48:48.000 --> 48:56.400]  refrigerators and dishwashers and thermostats and smart meters and smart TVs. You can't buy
[48:56.400 --> 49:03.040]  anything now, basically, that doesn't already have the Senate with all the wireless points.
[49:03.040 --> 49:12.000]  And then by law, all the devices have to give their codes over to the US government
[49:13.280 --> 49:17.280]  before they're even allowed to be manufactured, which, of course, will allow all the hackers to
[49:17.280 --> 49:22.240]  then get access as well. I mean, it's take one problem and make it a thousand times worse,
[49:22.240 --> 49:26.960]  and then take that problem, make it a thousand times worse. It's just a circular firing squad.
[49:26.960 --> 49:32.000]  Tucker Carlson did a 10-minute report on it last night. It was excellent.
[49:33.760 --> 49:38.560]  And we told you this was all coming. But it dovetails with the other legislation set to
[49:38.560 --> 49:48.640]  pass the Senate that's good that Ted Cruz authored that says companies selling anything smart tech,
[49:48.640 --> 49:54.800]  meaning it has microphones, cameras or reports back to them, have to disclose to you on the
[49:54.880 --> 49:59.760]  package they're doing it and have to have codes and ways for you to disable it and shut it off.
[50:01.360 --> 50:04.480]  Looks like putting on a package of cigarettes doesn't give you lung cancer.
[50:04.480 --> 50:10.960]  I mean, at least it's a start. So they got that legislation to stop this stuff or at least
[50:10.960 --> 50:15.360]  inform you what's going on. And then they got other legislation that like, oh, those Chinese,
[50:15.360 --> 50:20.480]  man, they're really bad spying on you. So we'll just take over everything to make sure you're safe.
[50:20.480 --> 50:25.120]  Oh, criminals might break in your house someday. So we're going to put five armed
[50:25.120 --> 50:29.680]  guards in your house and make you a prisoner. You're going to work for them now. I mean,
[50:29.680 --> 50:36.640]  it's so fantastical and it just shows there is no bridle on what these people do now.
[50:38.720 --> 50:44.480]  It is just this alone is bigger news than the shooting. The shooting is terrible. The
[50:44.480 --> 50:48.560]  transgender story is integral to the whole new world or takeover. It's all very important. But
[50:48.560 --> 50:52.240]  this tells you where the future is going. And we knew it a long time ago. We talked about it,
[50:52.240 --> 50:55.920]  where there's all these devices in your house, controlling your thermostat, controlling you,
[50:55.920 --> 50:58.880]  watching everything you do, carbon taxes reporting back on you,
[50:59.920 --> 51:05.040]  the home assistants watching and listening to you, including a little robot vacuum cleaner.
[51:07.600 --> 51:11.280]  They're not selling you that vacuum cleaner at cost because they like you.
[51:13.040 --> 51:18.160]  They're selling it to you because the data they sell off of it is going to make them 10 times
[51:18.160 --> 51:20.000]  what the purchase of the vacuum cleaner made.
[51:23.840 --> 51:28.800]  Like the big banks are giving free hand scanners and free software to all the different
[51:28.800 --> 51:33.520]  stores and different outlets, not because they love you, but because they want to implement
[51:33.520 --> 51:38.000]  this system. So this is the big rollout and it's beyond amazing.
[51:41.040 --> 51:47.280]  All I can say is, man, this is going to create hell on earth.
[51:48.880 --> 51:52.640]  So if you think they're bad censoring now, you think the congressional hearings about
[51:52.640 --> 51:56.400]  all the censorship and government ordered censorship is bad and the surveillance and
[51:56.400 --> 52:04.160]  the control is illegal, which it is, this is orders of magnitude worse and is so
[52:04.160 --> 52:07.840]  ridiculous what's in the bill. I mean, it says all this in the bill.
[52:10.080 --> 52:16.320]  Full access to everything in your house, no warrant, government systems, hardwired in,
[52:16.320 --> 52:24.160]  total control. That's what I said a few days ago. This isn't about, oh, let's ban TikTok
[52:24.160 --> 52:32.480]  because they spy on us and jump in your devices. It's that the Chinese are competing with what
[52:32.480 --> 52:42.480]  the globalists are doing. I say ban it all. But let's get back to Tucker Carlson. Here's
[52:42.480 --> 52:51.680]  Tucker Carlson being criticized last week on March 24th all over Rolling Stone, you name it.
[52:53.280 --> 53:00.720]  This one's LGBTQ nation. Tucker Carlson is afraid gun-toting trans people will start
[53:00.720 --> 53:09.520]  political violence. And then a few days later, three days later, his prophecy comes true.
[53:09.520 --> 53:16.160]  So here's Tucker from Friday, and then it happens on Monday. Here's part of the report.
[53:16.160 --> 53:19.520]  So you can imagine our surprise. The other day, we're driving through Cambridge in the
[53:19.520 --> 53:25.280]  old hybrid Subaru, adjusting our surgical masks to cover both nose and mouth and listening,
[53:25.280 --> 53:31.280]  needless to say, to National Public Radio, the voice of menopausal liberalism. And as
[53:31.280 --> 53:34.960]  we're listening, we hear this. We're going to play it for you and see if you can understand
[53:34.960 --> 53:43.040]  our total shock. Mass shootings targeting LGBTQ spaces and a rise in anti-trans rhetoric
[53:43.040 --> 53:48.000]  have inspired some queer people to take up arms. New Hampshire's public radio, Todd Bookman,
[53:48.000 --> 53:53.840]  joined a monthly gathering of a gun group that sees firearms as key to their own self-defense.
[53:53.840 --> 53:58.400]  And as you might imagine, this story does include the sound of gunfire. On a recent Sunday morning,
[53:58.400 --> 54:02.480]  the parking lot of Patuckaway State Park in southeastern New Hampshire is filling up with
[54:02.480 --> 54:06.720]  hikers. There's also a different crew packing up warm clothes and weapons.
[54:06.720 --> 54:09.040]  Thank you all for coming to Rainbow Reload.
[54:11.680 --> 54:18.320]  Your anti-trans rhetoric makes the trans community carry guns. Rainbow Reload.
[54:18.960 --> 54:23.120]  They're packing heat. They'll be appendix carrying in more ways than one. Watch out.
[54:23.680 --> 54:31.520]  Wait a second, we thought. This is NPR, National Public Radio, suddenly telling you that actually
[54:32.480 --> 54:38.720]  guns are good. They're valuable tools of self-defense, really against you. The Biden
[54:38.720 --> 54:45.280]  administration hired a kid to oversee nuclear waste disposal, whose only qualification was
[54:45.280 --> 54:49.920]  his sexual fetishes. So no, there's not genocide going on. There's some weird affirmative action
[54:49.920 --> 54:56.240]  program going on. But if you listen to NPR, you wouldn't know that. And that kind of talk
[54:56.240 --> 54:59.840]  might scare the heck out of you. And if they encourage you to go get a gun and arm yourself
[54:59.840 --> 55:05.680]  because Nazis are taking over Vermont, you might do it. Again, we're as for guns as you
[55:05.680 --> 55:11.600]  could possibly be. But this seems like an incitement. This seems like an incitement
[55:11.600 --> 55:18.240]  and it's everywhere. Oh, the LGBTQ XYZ is under attack. Oh, they're mass shooting us. None of it's
[55:18.240 --> 55:27.040]  true. Well, let's just go out and kill some little kids in an elementary school. That'll fix it.
[55:27.040 --> 55:35.760]  And then you look at the last few shootings at LBGT XYZ events, and it was transgender people.
[55:35.760 --> 55:40.400]  I showed you the articles earlier who were mad at their boyfriend or girlfriend or something.
[55:41.280 --> 55:46.320]  And they're just whacked out on psychotropics and Xanax and hormones. And you look at them,
[55:46.320 --> 55:53.840]  you know, green hair, all wild out. And you're like, this is what you do to people? This is
[55:53.840 --> 55:59.600]  what you offer? This is your wonderful new religion for us to all bow down to?
[56:00.720 --> 56:06.400]  And you want our guns? And I've talked to some of the big gun shops here in town that I
[56:07.200 --> 56:13.440]  visit, like the local shooting ranges, and they tell me the majority of their customers now are
[56:13.440 --> 56:20.480]  liberals since Trump preparing for civil war. So we can't have guns to protect ourselves in our
[56:20.480 --> 56:24.960]  house, but you're going to have your gun to fight us because we're Nazis, right?
[56:26.480 --> 56:35.280]  And then your grand poobah, your omnibudsman, your leader, your fuhrer is George Soros,
[56:37.440 --> 56:42.640]  who actually worked for the Nazis and said it was the best time of his life and invigorating and
[56:42.640 --> 56:46.960]  happy making. Those are all quotes. And I'm just like in a Twilight Zone episode.
[56:47.520 --> 56:51.280]  I don't want to kill you. I don't want you to kill me. I want to have a good life here, but
[56:51.840 --> 57:00.880]  got to be honest about what's going on. So all this and more S686 and more next hour. Remember,

[57:34.160 --> 57:40.080]  I appreciate all of your support. We'll be right back with our number two with Alex Stein,

[59:58.320 --> 01:00:11.200]  All right, Alex Stein's coming up the next segment to talk about the trans cult
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:16.000]  that attacked him over the weekend and all the latest developments, but I wanted to air part of
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:20.400]  this. Never Stein leaves us, I'm gonna get to the bill itself. It's something else we're going
[01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:28.240]  through at S686. The supposed counter to TikTok is a total, not internet takeover, but takeover
[01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:34.000]  of all the devices in your house so the Chinese don't do it. Don't worry, big Uncle Sam brother's
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.760]  gonna do it. Here's part of Tucker Carlson's report, the full 10 minute report's up on
[01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:43.600]  Infowars.com. Every day, more than 2 billion people use the social media app called TikTok.
[01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:48.640]  Many of them are young people under the age of 24. If you had kids, you probably know already
[01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:54.000]  how TikTok works. TikTok lets users upload short videos. Usually they're under 30 seconds.
[01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:59.280]  What's interesting is that the content of these videos varies a lot depending upon what country
[01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:04.400]  you're in. If you're in China where TikTok is headquartered, you tend to get more educational
[01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:09.840]  content. But if you live in this country, you get an awful lot of filth and propaganda tailored for
[01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:16.720]  kids. I'm not guessing about this. We ran an experiment to prove it last summer. Watch. The
[01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:23.520]  TikTok that Chinese residents, children in China get to see, is very different from the one your
[01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:30.080]  kids are looking at here. Now in China, where TikTok is known under a different name, videos
[01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:32.880]  like these are very common. Watch.
[01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:50.880]  You know what American kids, your kids are watching on TikTok, stuff like this.
[01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:22.960]  Well, that's kind of weird. Can you see what's going on here? Well, China does. They run TikTok
[01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:29.760]  and China knows if you want a productive society that extends beyond say next week, you teach your
[01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:35.680]  kids about hard work and creativity and personal responsibility, respect for authority. But if you
[01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:42.000]  want to destroy a society, you funnel a ton of garbage to kids about gender ideology and twerking.
[01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:46.880]  As the account lives of TikTok is documented extensively. That's exactly what TikTok is
[01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:52.800]  doing here. There's a whole genre of videos of teachers boasting about indoctrinating kids.
[01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:58.720]  I have had multiple students come out to me, not just with their sexuality,
[01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:03.760]  but also with their gender identity. It's one of the reasons I think it's so important to be
[01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:08.240]  out and loud and proud. I teach my elementary school students about gender identity. Some
[01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:11.040]  people are girls, some are boys, some are both, some are neither.
[01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:30.400]  So it goes without saying that net net, as they say, TikTok is not a positive influence on
[01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:35.200]  American society. And right now, in response to criticism of TikTok, China's government and the
[01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:40.080]  company itself are doing the same thing they did when they responded to allegations of a lab leak
[01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:47.040]  in Wuhan. They're saying anyone who raises questions is a racist. And they're doing that
[01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:52.240]  everywhere across the media. And they can because a lot of the news that you consume
[01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:59.440]  is paid for by TikTok. Politico, a completely, completely ideologically corrupt organization
[01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:04.800]  on Northern Virginia, has a so-called playbook that is sponsored by TikTok every other week.
[01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:10.720]  CNN, meanwhile, just put its tech reporter on the air to inform you that criticizing TikTok
[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:17.280]  opens up Chinese-Americans to, quote, hate and violence. If you criticize TikTok, you're killing
[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:22.480]  Asian people. So confronted with all this, you might support efforts in the Congress right now
[01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:29.200]  to ban TikTok altogether. And a lot of people do, not just on the right, but also on the left,
[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:32.320]  which is kind of interesting. This is one of those weird moments where there's,
[01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:37.680]  or appears to be, some kind of bipartisan consensus. And that alone might want to make
[01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:42.160]  you pause for a second. If everyone in power is saying the same thing, is it really a good idea?
[01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:46.800]  Let's take a closer look. And again, this is not a defensive TikTok, merely an acknowledgement of
[01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:51.040]  what's actually happening in Washington right now. So one of the bills that would ban TikTok
[01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:55.200]  is being pushed, as we said, by senators in both parties. It's called the restrict act.
[01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:58.960]  Mark Warner of Virginia and John Thune of South.
[01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:03.840]  Most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:11.840]  I want you all to know something. Alex Jones was right.
[01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:15.360]  Alex is right about far more than is wrong.
[01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:18.480]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:22.720]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down.
[01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:24.400]  Alex Jones was right.
[01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:28.480]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:32.240]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:36.080]  Alex Jones called this years ago, years ago.
[01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:39.200]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second.
[01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:42.720]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:45.200]  You are a martyr to the first amendment.
[01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:48.400]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:53.120]  That's why the globalists hate me is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:10.720]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:20.640]  Well, even before the tragic mass shooting at a Christian elementary school in Tennessee
[01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:23.040]  yesterday, I was wanting to get Alex Stein on.
[01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:28.800]  I appreciate him coming on on short notice because over the weekend I saw one of the
[01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:30.880]  latest videos of his going viral.
[01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:36.880]  Millions and millions of years of him out in a trans probe, trans protest event.
[01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:40.080]  And they began to dump coffee on him, physically attacking him, threatening him,
[01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:43.200]  saying he hopes he dies, hopes he commits suicide.
[01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:49.200]  And now we've had this latest event that's taken place.
[01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:52.880]  You have the big trans community groups who covered it last hour saying,
[01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:57.600]  oh, yeah, we have a day of rage coming, a day of violence on April 1st.
[01:06:57.600 --> 01:06:58.800]  I don't know if that's going to materialize.
[01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:01.280]  I hope it doesn't because we're being genocided.
[01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:02.400]  We're committing suicide.
[01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:07.920]  Well, because you're in a cult, the globalist set up that statistically is incredibly destructive
[01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:09.440]  for people.
[01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:16.240]  So Audrey Hale thought that she thought she was a man was being targeted.
[01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:19.920]  And there's a manifesto they're trying to keep from us, but we're told and we can see
[01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:23.360]  on posts she made that it was she was mad at transphobics.
[01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:28.560]  The way you get back at those is you shoot some eight, nine year old children to death
[01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:29.280]  with a rifle.
[01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:36.080]  So this is definitely a new thing to have women who think they're men out doing what
[01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:38.480]  the media advertises mass shootings.
[01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:42.720]  And we know the copycat effect that when somebody jumps off the Brooklyn Bridge, they
[01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:45.840]  go to post cops there for about a week as a bunch of others will start doing it.
[01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:48.080]  And it causes like a stampede of lemmings.
[01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:51.440]  So now it's kind of out there in the mind of these folks on all these psychotropic drugs
[01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:57.440]  and hormones that, well, the way you protest is you just go to a Christian school, you
[01:07:57.440 --> 01:08:00.800]  know, in a state that's passing a law that you can't mutilate children surgically.
[01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:04.320]  And you mutilate kids with high powered rifle rounds.
[01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:06.160]  So I want to play a few minutes.
[01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:10.240]  We had to bleep it quite a bit because every other word is a cuss word of some of the frothing
[01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:10.960]  mob.
[01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:15.360]  And Alex will tell us where this took place when it unfolded just a few days ago.
[01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:17.440]  I know we covered events in Austin as well.
[01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:23.040]  They were in all 50 states with the trans crowd out wanting to protect children by having
[01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:24.320]  access to them surgically.
[01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:24.800]  Here it is.
[01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:36.320]  I want you to see these white races.
[01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:17.120]  Oh, this is San Francisco.
[01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:18.240]  These are disgusting.
[01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:24.880]  They want to cut and mutilate children's genitals.
[01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:28.640]  Look, they want to cut children's waders off.
[01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:34.160]  And they start shoving him and pushing him out of the crowd over and over again.
[01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:36.240]  Or even trying to film it.
[01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:39.120]  They're also anti-free speech that goes without saying.
[01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:47.760]  How are you going to protect a kid by cutting off his genitals?
[01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:49.440]  These people don't want to protect kids.
[01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:52.160]  They don't want to protect kids by what?
[01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:53.520]  By cutting their genitals off?
[01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:03.040]  Guys, you're not protecting a kid by cutting his wiener off.
[01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:04.080]  You kids!
[01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:05.920]  You should not have your feet cut.
[01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:06.420]  Yes!
[01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:08.160]  Get off me!
[01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:08.660]  Get off me!
[01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:09.920]  Get off me!
[01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:10.560]  Get off me!
[01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:12.480]  Hey, hey, hey, hey!
[01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:13.040]  No, no, no.
[01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:15.680]  Look at this!
[01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:19.360]  Guys, this is where these people come from.
[01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:20.080]  Get off me!
[01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:20.640]  Get off me!
[01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:21.520]  Get off me!
[01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:23.440]  And they feel entitled to be violent.
[01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:25.120]  You guys should be ashamed of yourself.
[01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:28.000]  And I've got the articles right here with major trans organizations
[01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:31.520]  saying, well, you know, the killer's a victim too.
[01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:35.040]  Because you were mean to him, her.
[01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:41.520]  So let's go to Alex Stein now to talk about this.
[01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:43.680]  Couldn't be a more timely time to have him on.
[01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:47.280]  We've got Minnesota lawmakers advanced transgender reps legislation
[01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:51.360]  that could strip custody from parents who don't support child's transition.
[01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:55.920]  Canada's trying to take kids from parents that don't want them to commit suicide.
[01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:57.360]  I mean, this is a death cult.
[01:10:57.360 --> 01:11:00.080]  I'm wondering how much more obvious it's got to get.
[01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:01.760]  Alex Stein, thank you for joining us.
[01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:05.280]  Of course, Alex Stein needs no introduction.
[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:06.880]  Alexstein99 on Twitter.
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:09.840]  Alexstein99 on YouTube.
[01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:12.560]  Also doing a very popular, very entertaining, informative show
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:14.480]  with The Blaze as well.
[01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:15.120]  Love the set.
[01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:15.840]  Love what he does.
[01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:19.680]  Love the fact that he's just reaching more and more people.
[01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:21.840]  Alex, good to have you here with us.
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:26.800]  Well, it's a pleasure, but let me talk about the real elephant in the room, Alex,
[01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:28.000]  that nobody's talking about.
[01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:32.640]  So we see levels of autism today from an MMR vaccine, measles, mumps,
[01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:36.880]  rubella that the pharmaceutical companies will even say that correlation does not
[01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:40.560]  equal causation when the alarming rates of autism.
[01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:43.840]  And now if you actually look and you actually look at the mental health studies,
[01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:49.520]  a lot of these people that identify as non-binary or transgender are high functioning autists.
[01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:54.480]  You'll see now in the media, they're talking about Aubrey Hale is a high functioning autist.
[01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:58.240]  So that is the crux of this problem is that we're basically
[01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:00.880]  enabling people that are actually mentally challenged.
[01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:02.880]  It's even stronger than gender dysphoria.
[01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:05.040]  They're actually suffering from autism.
[01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:08.640]  And that is why this society is getting so bad because the
[01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:12.000]  increased rate of autism is going to only increase the rate of transgenderism.
[01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:14.880]  You just hit the nail on the board a decade ago.
[01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:18.720]  I had a liberal member of parliament on who found over half the kids they were having
[01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:20.320]  transition were autistic.
[01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:23.520]  They know once you get an autistic kid to obsess on something and give them attention
[01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:27.360]  when they're like six or seven or even younger, they then tell them you're a boy,
[01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:28.640]  you're a girl, they're really the other.
[01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:30.000]  That becomes their identity.
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:31.440]  They become obsessed with it.
[01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:34.560]  And if you criticize them or warn them, they think you're attacking them.
[01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:36.480]  And absolutely, you go to these events,
[01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:39.120]  almost all these people are completely autistic.
[01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:39.760]  They're victims.
[01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:44.560]  No, and you really, you look at the kids and the kids you can tell are slightly autistic.
[01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:49.520]  And for a parent, there's nothing more evil than you have a kid that is suffering from
[01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:51.760]  a form of mental retardation.
[01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:53.440]  I'm not even saying that to be funny.
[01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:56.800]  You know, we call a spade a spade.
[01:12:56.800 --> 01:13:00.000]  And now you're enabling them to not only change their sex,
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:01.920]  but to actually get gender reassignment surgery.
[01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:05.360]  See, this rally, Alex, was not just for trans awareness.
[01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:08.480]  This was actually youth for trans.
[01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:13.600]  This is a rally in order to fight legislation that is preventing in states like Florida
[01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:17.840]  and Idaho and they're trying to do in Texas, preventing gender reassignment surgery for
[01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:18.400]  children.
[01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:21.680]  So these people, they have all the rights that you and I have.
[01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:23.360]  They're not missing any rights.
[01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:29.520]  What they're fighting for is that children can have state sponsored gender mutilation
[01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:30.080]  surgery.
[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:33.600]  And for me, that is why I'm out there in that crowd fighting against it.
[01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:34.880]  If you want to be trans, go ahead.
[01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:36.320]  If you're an adult, that's fine.
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:40.880]  But to enable these kids and to trick these kids that are, you know, mentally ill, there's
[01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:42.720]  nothing more disgusting in my opinion, Alex.
[01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:45.120]  You're absolutely right.
[01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:49.120]  And while you were just talking, the crew just searched what you said for new viewers.
[01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:49.920]  We're not making this up.
[01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:55.680]  They found a bunch of mainline articles admitting, oh, yes, most of the trans kids are autistic.
[01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:59.760]  So they're just confusing autistic children and saying you're confused, not because we
[01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:04.240]  fried your brain with drugs or chemicals or GMO or poison shots.
[01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:05.280]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:06.480]  You're not a boy.
[01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:07.440]  You're not a girl.
[01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:08.640]  You're a space alien.
[01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:09.760]  You're a free spirit.
[01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:12.160]  You're a there's hundreds of these new genders.
[01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:14.720]  It's like telling kids, oh, take the shot.
[01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:15.680]  You're like a superhero.
[01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:18.480]  They're like, oh, become a new a new thing.
[01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:19.760]  Just pick your identity.
[01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:22.800]  These little kids that are autistic think they're like picking a superhero they want
[01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:23.280]  to be.
[01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:27.840]  They're really being inducted into a deep state operation to finally sterilize them.
[01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:30.880]  No, and that's actually what's happening.
[01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:33.040]  And people are going to get mad at us for talking about this.
[01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:36.400]  And it's a subject that's not talked about in the mainstream media whatsoever.
[01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:40.960]  And it's something that really should be covered is the rates of autism and the rates of children
[01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:42.720]  that identify as this.
[01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:45.760]  And once again, it's the attack on the children.
[01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:46.800]  That is the problem.
[01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:48.560]  And you've been exposing this for a long time.
[01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:52.960]  But, man, with the massive amounts of pornography and then you look at, like you said earlier,
[01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:59.120]  with the psychotropic drugs, when you get a kid on dissociative properties in their brain,
[01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:03.440]  I mean, literally medicine that makes him antisocial, that doesn't help their mood.
[01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:05.920]  I mean, whose mood is supposed to be stabilized, Alex?
[01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:07.040]  That doesn't even make sense.
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:09.840]  The idea of giving somebody a mood stabilizer, that's not life.
[01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:12.240]  You're supposed to have ups and downs, happy and sad.
[01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:16.320]  But they literally want to turn these people into zombies that have no connection with
[01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:19.360]  reality and that they actually probably fantasize about shooting kids.
[01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:21.440]  And when they do it, when this person does it,
[01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:26.240]  once again, the trans community doesn't even take any onus of it.
[01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:31.520]  As a matter of fact, USA Today apologized for misgendering the school shooter, Alex.
[01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:32.320]  So that's where we're at.
[01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:35.600]  They care more about the feelings of a dead school shooter
[01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:38.640]  and offending a community than actually telling the truth.
[01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:40.560]  Absolutely right.
[01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:44.160]  And they go further when their own people commit suicide or kill others.
[01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:45.680]  They say, oh, you were mean to them.
[01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:47.120]  That's why they did it.
[01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:48.720]  Not because they're caught in this cult.
[01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:51.040]  Alex Stein is always on target.
[01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:54.560]  He's going to continue with us on the other side and talk about where we go next.
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:06.480]  If Alex Jones runs for president in the Republican Party, he has a chance of winning.
[01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:14.720]  If you just tuned in, you may be noticing I'm wearing an Alex Jones for president 2024 shirt.
[01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:18.000]  I am not seriously planning to run for president.
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:21.200]  This is an idea the crew had to have a triggering shirt.
[01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:22.000]  Kind of next level.
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:23.200]  Alex Jones was right.
[01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:24.800]  There's Infowars.com in the back.
[01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:27.600]  Alex Jones for president 2024 on the front.
[01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:28.640]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:29.920]  It's made out of really nice fabric.
[01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:31.200]  It's high quality.
[01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:34.080]  And it is a exclusive shirt to Infowarsstore.com.
[01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:36.560]  And when the shirts are gone, they're gone.
[01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:41.520]  We're doing one run of Alex Jones for president 2024 shirts.
[01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:45.200]  And we'll have a historic memento, be able to spread the word,
[01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:49.360]  meet a lot of like minded people, and you will be able to keep us on the air.
[01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:50.400]  No way.
[01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:50.720]  No way.
[01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:52.000]  That's a bridge too far.
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:53.760]  That's no, it can't be.
[01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:56.400]  And I said on national television that he was going to win.
[01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:58.640]  At Infowarsstore.com.
[01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:04.720]  We now have three new game changing products that are in stock at Infowarsstore.com.

[01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:00.080]  I've got some good news.
[01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:03.440]  Our high quality supplements really work.
[01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:07.920]  And we have about an 80% reorder rate with customers.
[01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:08.720]  That's the good news.
[01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:09.360]  They're amazing.
[01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:15.120]  The bad news is around 1% or a little less of our actual viewers and listeners ever go
[01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:17.520]  to Infowarsstore.com and ever actually buy the products.
[01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:19.760]  So you're missing out on these products.
[01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:21.520]  Plus it funds the Infowars.
[01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:26.480]  Think of what we've done with just 1% of our massive audience actually buying products.
[01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:32.160]  Think what would happen if those of you on the fence actually went to Infowarsstore.com
[01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:34.000]  and got some of these amazing products.
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:38.720]  I would recommend Tumorink 95 for your joints, your bones, inflammation to get one of the
[01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:39.760]  biggest effects.
[01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:41.760]  So you reorder it and see how great it is.

[01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:56.480]  Just go try the product, fund the Infowars and help us defeat the New World War together.
[01:19:56.480 --> 01:19:58.240]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:19:58.240 --> 01:20:04.640]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:06.640]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:38.640]  I thought the devil got down on his level.
[01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:42.640]  But I never get in so you hear me.
[01:20:42.640 --> 01:20:48.640]  I'm a stranger to the rain.
[01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:52.640]  I don't spot bad weapons.
[01:20:52.640 --> 01:21:13.920]  And the police have got a lot of problems, but they have been thrown in the middle of
[01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:19.040]  this meat grinder and they have withstood the pain and we salute the officers that took
[01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:20.800]  out this psychotic demon.
[01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:26.480]  Alex Stein, how do we counter a system that knowingly has put pesticides and chemicals
[01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:32.160]  and mercury in the injections that all the real studies show have caused from 1 in 15,000
[01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:37.440]  60 years ago with autism to 1 in 33 today, even worse in places like South Korea.
[01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:39.080]  The more the shots, the more it happens.
[01:21:39.080 --> 01:21:43.000]  Then they tailor it to target these children for sterilization.
[01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:46.200]  You can see this program of evil.
[01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:47.520]  How do we stop it?
[01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:52.800]  Well, I mean, I would want to say like you always talk about the information war and
[01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:58.120]  I say that kind of with trepidation because no amount of information can convince an idiot.
[01:21:58.120 --> 01:22:00.840]  And that's the problem is that I'm not very smart.
[01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:02.140]  Society is not very smart.
[01:22:02.140 --> 01:22:05.140]  They just want to follow the leader and be told that everything is safe and effective.
[01:22:05.140 --> 01:22:09.560]  So like you said, I mean, from what they spray in the skies to what they put in our tap water
[01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:13.360]  to the vaccines that they give us when we're an infant, I don't know.
[01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:17.680]  It's a very, very challenging, tough question that I don't know if I have the answers to
[01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:20.080]  because it's more than the new world order.
[01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:27.040]  It's some sort of satanic agenda that is anti-human for lack of a better word.
[01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:30.320]  I totally agree with you.
[01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:34.360]  All this talk in the media that the trans community is being targeted when they're being
[01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:38.800]  targeted by the globalist, but not by us, they've been created by the globalist.
[01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:43.600]  And now the creation is mad at those of us because it's miserable.
[01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:44.600]  We're trying to help them.
[01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:46.640]  But what are you expecting to see?
[01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:51.080]  Because I know you go out and interface these folks more than anybody else around the country.
[01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:54.800]  They always attack you with the drag queen, pedo times, all of it.
[01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:58.500]  So you know these folks as good as anybody out there.
[01:22:58.500 --> 01:23:04.480]  They're really talking about battle of the gods, good or done or wrong, Armageddon type
[01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:05.480]  stuff.
[01:23:05.480 --> 01:23:06.840]  What do you expect to see out of them now?
[01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:10.360]  I hope nobody goes out and attacks them back.
[01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:12.520]  No, nobody should retaliate.
[01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:17.480]  That's exactly the opposite of what we should do is any sort of retaliation.
[01:23:17.480 --> 01:23:21.200]  But you have guys like Scott Wiener, who's a state senator in California, Alex, and everybody's
[01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:22.200]  familiar with him.
[01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:28.860]  And he has pictures where he's at gay pride event with leather, BDSM gear.
[01:23:28.860 --> 01:23:35.560]  For me, he's a legislator that is literally trying to make accessible gender reassignment
[01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:37.840]  surgery for children of all age.
[01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:41.000]  We have people that are in the highest power, the highest positions that are writing the
[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:42.000]  bills.
[01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:46.240]  He said he wants to legalize pedophilia.
[01:23:46.240 --> 01:23:51.640]  Literally that's like literally, I mean, you know, obviously I don't want to say anything
[01:23:51.640 --> 01:23:52.640]  that I haven't seen.
[01:23:52.640 --> 01:23:56.720]  I don't want to accuse him of being a pedophile, but every tweet, every legislation, everything
[01:23:56.720 --> 01:23:59.400]  he signed has groomer pedophilia vibes.
[01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:03.720]  Well, I mean, no, I mean, I mean, he's gotten laws passed to not have criminal charges on
[01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:04.720]  pedophiles.
[01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:05.720]  Yeah.
[01:24:05.720 --> 01:24:08.520]  It's like the guy, what's the guy, I can't remember the Twitter guy's name.
[01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:13.440]  He wrote the book on gay grinder and in that same book, he said that kids should have access
[01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:14.720]  to gay dating apps.
[01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:18.720]  And this is the person that said, you know, the head of the biggest social media platform
[01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:21.960]  on the internet, arguably, I guess, other than Facebook.
[01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:26.440]  So I mean, it's just, I don't know, there's a sick evil agenda, Alex, and you know this,
[01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:30.640]  and I know this, there's only a few people that really are calling the shots and it's
[01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:35.680]  guys like, you know, the Jeffrey Epstein's, the top dogs, these people do not care about
[01:24:35.680 --> 01:24:36.680]  children.
[01:24:36.680 --> 01:24:38.180]  They've abused children at the highest levels.
[01:24:38.180 --> 01:24:41.920]  You look at John Luke Brunell, actually one of the most disgusting things that Jeffrey
[01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:45.480]  Epstein would talk about and brag about, and this is an open thing, is for Jeffrey Epstein's
[01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:49.440]  birthday, Jean-Luc Brunell gave him three 11 year old triplets.
[01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:54.000]  And that was, you know, his, you know, his best sexual experience that he would describe.
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:58.760]  So he's best friends with a guy named Bill Clinton, who is literally getting BJs from
[01:24:58.760 --> 01:24:59.760]  Monica Lewinsky.
[01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:03.680]  So what I'm saying, when I look at this whole agenda and it goes to the top, guys like Dennis
[01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:05.920]  Hastert, Speaker of the House, was a pedophile.
[01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:11.020]  So this is a pedophile grooming agenda, Alex, and it's satanic, it's demonic.
[01:25:11.020 --> 01:25:16.440]  We talk about this in the culture where all the time, but it's this anti-God, it's bigger
[01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:17.440]  than you and I.
[01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:18.440]  It's bigger than F.O.
[01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:19.440]  Wars.
[01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:23.320]  And sadly, I have this kind of black pill mindset where I don't want to feel hopeless
[01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:25.360]  because I don't want to be a victim.
[01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:26.760]  You don't want to be a victim.
[01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:32.280]  But sadly, we taught every single kid that that's how you gain social points in societies
[01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:33.640]  by being the biggest victim.
[01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:38.400]  So until we change the whole mindset of teaching kids that they're not a victim because their
[01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:42.600]  ancestors were slaves or, you know, or we don't poison them and cause them to have autism,
[01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:44.100]  we don't stop this.
[01:25:44.100 --> 01:25:47.800]  The movie Idiocracy is going to come to life.
[01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:52.120]  And it's I feel like we're on a trajectory that's almost unstoppable at this point.
[01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:53.120]  Well, that's it.
[01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:57.180]  You know, we're vindicated that the New World Order is out in the open, but who cares?
[01:25:57.180 --> 01:25:58.440]  We're now here in it.
[01:25:58.440 --> 01:26:01.540]  And I have that same feeling of not even depression.
[01:26:01.540 --> 01:26:03.960]  It's more just like my mouth's hanging open.
[01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:05.440]  And by the day, it gets more insane.
[01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:06.640]  Where do you see this going?
[01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:08.240]  Is there any bottom to it?
[01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:13.120]  Well, I mean, I was it's funny, I was actually just watching the Obama deception, one of
[01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:14.120]  the best movies ever.
[01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:18.280]  And, you know, that kind of laid the groundwork and obviously a lot of your documentaries.
[01:26:18.280 --> 01:26:21.160]  But I'm watching that and this is why I'm having an existential crisis.
[01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:23.280]  And I'm like, Barack Obama is still in power.
[01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:25.600]  He is obviously still the shadow president.
[01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:27.840]  So we have this deep state.
[01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:31.720]  And, you know, you look at Joe Biden and the business dealings with Hunter Biden, everybody
[01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:33.560]  knows about the illegal deals.
[01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:34.960]  I don't even care about that.
[01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:36.560]  I mean, I mean, obviously, I take that back.
[01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:37.560]  I do care about that.
[01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:40.760]  But what I care about more is the New World Order is that these elites that are trying
[01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:43.160]  to destabilize America and make us incredibly weak.
[01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:45.360]  I'm not surprised that a politician trying to make money.
[01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:49.880]  I'm just sad that a poll that these politicians are trying to ruin America, put a stain on
[01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:54.120]  America by potentially arresting Donald Trump for a misdemeanor crime.
[01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:57.400]  And the problem is that puts a stain on the whole entire country, Alex.
[01:26:57.400 --> 01:26:58.980]  That makes us look bad.
[01:26:58.980 --> 01:27:01.160]  So we're shooting ourselves in the foot.
[01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:03.880]  And I don't know, we're going to keep shooting ourselves in the foot until we run out of
[01:27:03.880 --> 01:27:07.080]  metaphorical bullets at this point.
[01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:11.800]  I want to talk about a young turds clip when we come back.
[01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:13.720]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:19.520]  Just days before the shooting in Tennessee, he told trans people get guns because the
[01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:21.360]  right wing is coming to kill you.
[01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:23.480]  And we're not killing any of these people.
[01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:27.360]  And I mean, the point is, is that they're literally being told they're under attack.
[01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:29.000]  So they come out, attack us.
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:32.200]  It's just it's so sad.
[01:27:32.200 --> 01:27:33.600]  And you know, people are getting mad at me.
[01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:35.120]  They want me to press charges out.
[01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:39.320]  But, you know, and I probably should have because these people don't face any consequences
[01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:40.320]  when they do this stuff.
[01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:42.200]  They don't face any consequences in the media.
[01:27:42.200 --> 01:27:44.800]  As a matter of fact, in all their groups, they're probably applauded.
[01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:46.080]  They're probably said, oh, that's good.
[01:27:46.080 --> 01:27:47.720]  You have to fight the patriarchy.
[01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:48.720]  You have to fight.
[01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:51.640]  I mean, describe, as we see in the video, they're hitting you, they're pouring things
[01:27:51.640 --> 01:27:53.240]  on you, they're threatening you.
[01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:55.360]  But obviously, the camera can't catch it all.
[01:27:55.360 --> 01:28:00.120]  You need a few extra camera people with you, not just by yourself, a lot of courage marching
[01:28:00.120 --> 01:28:01.120]  into these groups.
[01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:02.120]  They always attack you.
[01:28:02.120 --> 01:28:04.520]  As soon as they're getting more bold, what they do to you in San Francisco?
[01:28:04.520 --> 01:28:07.280]  Well, I mean, I was getting punched out.
[01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:12.440]  You know, the hot coffee, Alex, when they poured a big jug of cold water on me, that
[01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:13.440]  was actually kind of nice.
[01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:14.680]  I mean, that wasn't a big deal.
[01:28:14.680 --> 01:28:17.000]  But the hot coffee was weird because I wasn't expecting it.
[01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:18.400]  It was about six inches from my face.
[01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:22.400]  Luckily, I had sunglasses on, but it was just it felt like I got sprayed with urine
[01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:23.400]  at first.
[01:28:23.400 --> 01:28:24.400]  I had like an Andy No flashback.
[01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:28.520]  I'm like, what did I just because it was a warm liquid is very unpleasant when it wasn't
[01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:29.520]  burning hot.
[01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:30.520]  They'd been standing outside for a little while.
[01:28:30.520 --> 01:28:34.000]  But when I get hit with this hot liquid, it was just very unusual.
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.280]  I never felt out of control because they're a bunch of wimps, Alex.
[01:28:36.280 --> 01:28:38.400]  I could have literally fought them myself.
[01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:41.760]  You and I, Alex, we could have taken them out by ourselves.
[01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:45.200]  They're a bunch of soy, very weak people.
[01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:47.080]  They feel entitled to attack whoever they want.
[01:28:47.080 --> 01:28:51.680]  But yeah, when I was in Seattle, the guy had a boiling hot thermos, but luckily it
[01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:54.280]  cooled off in a few seconds, but dumped it right on my face.
[01:28:54.280 --> 01:28:55.280]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:55.280 --> 01:28:56.280]  Stay with us.
[01:28:56.280 --> 01:29:04.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new toothpaste that my dad, a retired dentist and oral surgeon
[01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:05.800]  developed.
[01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:10.200]  Dr. Jones, natural tumor toothpaste that just came into stock.
[01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:14.600]  And I got to tell you, I got samples of this months ago and it is amazing the way it makes
[01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:15.600]  your gums feel.
[01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:18.120]  What it does to your mouth is insane.
[01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:22.720]  We know turmeric is an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory, it does such great things to the body.
[01:29:22.720 --> 01:29:26.720]  Then you add that with tea tree oil and a bunch of other essential oils, it is just
[01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:27.720]  dynamite.
[01:29:27.720 --> 01:29:31.640]  It is so good to detox and attack inflammation in your mouth.
[01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:36.240]  I want to challenge everybody to try the new toothpaste at mfoolworthstore.com.
[01:29:36.240 --> 01:29:39.080]  Dr. Jones, natural turmeric toothpaste.

[01:32:31.480 --> 01:32:36.480]  encourage you now to realize that mfoolworths cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[01:32:36.480 --> 01:32:37.960]  I know you spread the word.
[01:32:37.960 --> 01:32:39.640]  I know you pray for us and that's wonderful.
[01:32:39.640 --> 01:32:40.640]  Keep doing it.
[01:32:40.640 --> 01:32:45.080]  But most viewers and listeners never go to mfoolworthstore.com and you never buy great
[01:32:45.080 --> 01:32:48.520]  products that enrich and empower your life all at the same time keep us on air.
[01:32:48.520 --> 01:32:52.760]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at mfoolworthstore.com.
[01:32:52.760 --> 01:32:57.560]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to mfoolworthstore.com, our funding problems
[01:32:57.560 --> 01:32:58.560]  will be over.
[01:32:58.560 --> 01:33:00.360]  Please take action now.
[01:33:00.360 --> 01:33:06.440]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:18.520 --> 01:33:38.080]  So we hear from the January 6th propaganda that right wingers are planting violence everywhere,
[01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:42.280]  but really it's the left with antifund BLM and all the rest of that we see engaging in
[01:33:42.280 --> 01:33:45.520]  violence statistically off the charts.
[01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:50.920]  And I don't bring up this article because it's about me, but it's illustrative of what's
[01:33:50.920 --> 01:33:51.920]  going on.
[01:33:51.920 --> 01:33:54.720]  This is all over Twitter, all over Facebook without me even looking.
[01:33:54.720 --> 01:33:58.620]  It's been sent to me like a hundred times, not just this article.
[01:33:58.620 --> 01:34:05.120]  This article is about the trend and you read the article and it says why Jane Fonda is
[01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:11.580]  being compared to Alex Jones after Nashville shooting.
[01:34:11.580 --> 01:34:16.380]  And it says Jane Fonda said it's time to start killing Christians because they're trying
[01:34:16.380 --> 01:34:18.500]  to restrict abortion.
[01:34:18.500 --> 01:34:24.820]  And that's just like Alex Jones saying attack schools.
[01:34:24.820 --> 01:34:29.020]  When did I ever see, they know the general public doesn't know about Adam Lanza that
[01:34:29.020 --> 01:34:31.260]  did the shooting at Sandy Hook.
[01:34:31.260 --> 01:34:34.620]  You hear the word Sandy Hook, you think Alex Jones.
[01:34:34.620 --> 01:34:41.740]  So now it's a whole article about just like Alex Jones wants violence, Jane Fonda wants
[01:34:41.740 --> 01:34:42.740]  violence.
[01:34:42.740 --> 01:34:43.740]  What?
[01:34:43.740 --> 01:34:44.740]  What?
[01:34:44.740 --> 01:34:45.740]  What?
[01:34:45.740 --> 01:34:47.300]  I thought I was bad for saying maybe something was staged.
[01:34:47.300 --> 01:34:50.980]  I wasn't even the first person to say it, I just covered a news item.
[01:34:50.980 --> 01:34:57.860]  But see, that's how they're blurring the lines with people not paying attention.
[01:34:57.860 --> 01:35:00.460]  And then I've got countless articles like this one.
[01:35:00.460 --> 01:35:05.260]  Video, leftist professor suspended after calling for murder of conservative speakers.
[01:35:05.260 --> 01:35:06.940]  That's on Infowars.com.
[01:35:06.940 --> 01:35:14.220]  So that's the backdrop, but here's Sink Uyghur urges trans Americans to get guns just days
[01:35:14.220 --> 01:35:15.620]  before Nashville mass shootings.
[01:35:15.620 --> 01:35:19.180]  So did NPR, just on Thursday.
[01:35:19.180 --> 01:35:20.420]  Tucker Crobert on Friday.
[01:35:20.420 --> 01:35:26.380]  So the talking point is the right wing's coming to kill you, get your guns, and then they
[01:35:26.380 --> 01:35:29.620]  go out and shoot people.
[01:35:29.620 --> 01:35:35.680]  And the last five mass shooters that just randomly targeted people were trans.
[01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:39.820]  So these people are brainwashed, they're autistic.
[01:35:39.820 --> 01:35:43.020]  And this is mind control on a mass scale, folks.
[01:35:43.020 --> 01:35:53.340]  Because they listen to the media, they believe it, they're obsessed, and they go out.
[01:35:53.340 --> 01:35:59.500]  So it's just insane, ladies and gentlemen, how all this works.
[01:35:59.500 --> 01:36:02.740]  So let's play a quick Young Turds Club.
[01:36:02.740 --> 01:36:05.980]  And then let's play the one about if he's a world dictator, he wants to legalize pleasuring
[01:36:05.980 --> 01:36:06.980]  donkeys.
[01:36:06.980 --> 01:36:07.980]  Here it is.
[01:36:07.980 --> 01:36:09.060]  I'll be a little bit of a hypocrite here, but it's not.
[01:36:09.060 --> 01:36:10.820]  I'll explain why I'm saying it.
[01:36:10.820 --> 01:36:12.900]  I don't like guns.
[01:36:12.900 --> 01:36:15.780]  I would ban assault weapons in a second.
[01:36:15.780 --> 01:36:19.820]  We can go on and on about the gun control that we need in this country.
[01:36:19.820 --> 01:36:23.060]  And I always tell people, don't get guns, it'll make you less safe.
[01:36:23.060 --> 01:36:27.420]  I'm gonna make you an exception here for trans people.
[01:36:27.420 --> 01:36:29.180]  They are actually in danger.
[01:36:29.180 --> 01:36:32.060]  They have had hundreds of laws passed against them.
[01:36:32.060 --> 01:36:37.300]  They have right wing media ginning up fear against them 24 seven.
[01:36:37.300 --> 01:36:40.260]  They are targeted more than any other group in America.
[01:36:40.260 --> 01:36:45.020]  And if anyone should get guns, it should be trans Americans, okay?
[01:36:45.020 --> 01:36:46.420]  Because I'm worried for them.
[01:36:46.420 --> 01:36:51.420]  I'm worried that the right wing lunatics are going to attack them as they have over and
[01:36:51.420 --> 01:36:52.420]  over again.
[01:36:52.420 --> 01:36:57.260]  And by the way, it's not just right wing lunatics, other people attack trans folks as well.
[01:36:57.260 --> 01:37:02.380]  I believe that I am going, I, if I were the rule of the benevolent dictator of the world,
[01:37:02.380 --> 01:37:12.180]  I would legalize bestiality where you are giving, where you are pleasuring animal.
[01:37:12.180 --> 01:37:15.020]  You see what I'm saying?
[01:37:15.020 --> 01:37:16.020]  Okay.
[01:37:16.020 --> 01:37:17.020]  Okay.
[01:37:17.020 --> 01:37:18.020]  What, what now?
[01:37:18.020 --> 01:37:19.020]  Why?
[01:37:19.020 --> 01:37:20.020]  Why did that happen?
[01:37:20.020 --> 01:37:21.020]  Is the dumbest thing you said?
[01:37:21.020 --> 01:37:22.020]  It really is the dumbest thing you said.
[01:37:22.020 --> 01:37:23.020]  No, no.
[01:37:23.020 --> 01:37:24.020]  I'll tell you why.
[01:37:24.020 --> 01:37:25.020]  I'll tell you why.
[01:37:25.020 --> 01:37:28.420]  It was the case that we covered where there was like a guy or a girl or something that
[01:37:28.420 --> 01:37:32.700]  was pleasuring a horse and the horse came to a conclusion, right?
[01:37:32.700 --> 01:37:33.860]  So who got harmed?
[01:37:33.860 --> 01:37:38.540]  You know that people who are, okay, look, not to be a downer, I don't want to hear more
[01:37:38.540 --> 01:37:46.460]  of the point is that guy's a pervert and they know exactly what they're doing and they know
[01:37:46.460 --> 01:37:49.180]  exactly what they're selling.
[01:37:49.180 --> 01:37:54.340]  And so we see the agenda really on display here.
[01:37:54.340 --> 01:37:55.340]  Alex Stein.
[01:37:55.340 --> 01:37:59.580]  Well, you know, I don't want to be too black filled.
[01:37:59.580 --> 01:38:03.160]  Let's talk about the actual incredible response by the national SWAT team.
[01:38:03.160 --> 01:38:07.980]  They went in there and they, you know, stabilized the situation and took out the school shooter.
[01:38:07.980 --> 01:38:11.020]  And the reason why that's a big deal is because you look at you, I think they could have done
[01:38:11.020 --> 01:38:15.460]  the same thing with a similar shooter that had some sort of gender dysphoria.
[01:38:15.460 --> 01:38:19.460]  So it's the response of the police department, I think, that saved a lot of lives.
[01:38:19.460 --> 01:38:24.900]  So that's the one positive thing about this and just trying to find something so we don't
[01:38:24.900 --> 01:38:28.900]  just sit here and, you know, make everybody so sad, like, you know, all these guys are
[01:38:28.900 --> 01:38:30.620]  actual heroes for walking in there.
[01:38:30.620 --> 01:38:33.620]  And you know, that's not an easy thing to pull.
[01:38:33.620 --> 01:38:36.500]  They were getting shot at when the killer, I mean, they're getting, they walked right
[01:38:36.500 --> 01:38:38.700]  into the car.
[01:38:38.700 --> 01:38:39.700]  And they weren't scared.
[01:38:39.700 --> 01:38:44.060]  I mean, then you see the videos of Uvalde, you know, SWAT team where they're using hand
[01:38:44.060 --> 01:38:45.060]  sanitizer.
[01:38:45.060 --> 01:38:46.060]  They're kind of smirking.
[01:38:46.060 --> 01:38:47.060]  They're taking their time.
[01:38:47.060 --> 01:38:48.060]  They're not running in there.
[01:38:48.060 --> 01:38:49.500]  I mean, those guys are real heroes.
[01:38:49.500 --> 01:38:53.420]  So those guys definitely deserve, you know, some kudos for that.
[01:38:53.420 --> 01:38:57.180]  And by the way, 20 years ago, you never saw cops stand down and act like cowards.
[01:38:57.180 --> 01:38:59.700]  I'm ashamed, actually, that happened in Texas.
[01:38:59.700 --> 01:39:02.840]  Cops always acted like the police in Tennessee.
[01:39:02.840 --> 01:39:03.840]  What the hell's happening?
[01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:06.180]  I guess this is an example of it.
[01:39:06.180 --> 01:39:08.180]  They're becoming bureaucrats, not warriors.
[01:39:08.180 --> 01:39:10.820]  Yeah, because listen, you're in Texas.
[01:39:10.820 --> 01:39:11.820]  I'm in Texas.
[01:39:11.820 --> 01:39:12.820]  I talk to these sheriffs all the time.
[01:39:12.820 --> 01:39:13.820]  I'm in the bail bond business.
[01:39:13.820 --> 01:39:18.700]  You know, these cops are afraid to do their job because now everything is so litigious
[01:39:18.700 --> 01:39:23.020]  and being a cop now, you're basically kind of like a hall monitor.
[01:39:23.020 --> 01:39:28.540]  So the idea that these guys are like solving crimes are really and truly they're going
[01:39:28.540 --> 01:39:32.660]  to domestic violence situations and oftentimes in bad situations and domestic violence, that's
[01:39:32.660 --> 01:39:36.520]  one of the worst calls that cops respond to and they actually get hurt oftentimes in domestic
[01:39:36.520 --> 01:39:37.520]  violence.
[01:39:37.520 --> 01:39:39.540]  So I don't know that they have a very uphill battle.
[01:39:39.540 --> 01:39:43.380]  But I know by taking away my guns or your guns, the cops are still going to have them.
[01:39:43.380 --> 01:39:44.740]  The military is still going to have them.
[01:39:44.740 --> 01:39:50.140]  So with all this, this is the biggest key, I think, for us talking that we are the counterculture.
[01:39:50.140 --> 01:39:52.220]  We have to talk about how this is a mental health problem.
[01:39:52.220 --> 01:39:53.220]  This is not a gun problem.
[01:39:53.220 --> 01:39:55.420]  It was the guns that took the killer out.
[01:39:55.420 --> 01:39:56.420]  We need more guns.
[01:39:56.420 --> 01:40:02.440]  And that's, you know, Sank, Uyghur or whatever talking about, you know, fellatio on the horse.
[01:40:02.440 --> 01:40:03.440]  That's disgusting.
[01:40:03.440 --> 01:40:06.980]  But at least he was kind of right in saying we need more guns.
[01:40:06.980 --> 01:40:09.540]  I believe guns actually protect us.
[01:40:09.540 --> 01:40:11.860]  So not just the bad guys should have guns.
[01:40:11.860 --> 01:40:14.420]  Good guys should have them as well.
[01:40:14.420 --> 01:40:15.420]  Absolutely.
[01:40:15.420 --> 01:40:17.580]  But, you know, we talked about this earlier.
[01:40:17.580 --> 01:40:21.220]  We're not being blackpilled being honest about this.
[01:40:21.220 --> 01:40:23.120]  The good news is we know what's going on.
[01:40:23.120 --> 01:40:27.660]  And the good news is we know it's an engineered globalist operation.
[01:40:27.660 --> 01:40:28.940]  And so that means we can stop it.
[01:40:28.940 --> 01:40:29.940]  We can cut it off.
[01:40:29.940 --> 01:40:32.480]  I mean, look at how they were pushing the poison shot in the lockdowns.
[01:40:32.480 --> 01:40:33.620]  We stopped that.
[01:40:33.620 --> 01:40:35.260]  Now the globalists are in trouble on that front.
[01:40:35.260 --> 01:40:39.500]  So as negative as it is, I want listeners to realize that we don't have a choice.
[01:40:39.500 --> 01:40:40.500]  We've got to stand up.
[01:40:40.500 --> 01:40:41.500]  We've got to fight.
[01:40:42.140 --> 01:40:46.540]  This is all coming out of an organized evil plan that's even beyond humans.
[01:40:46.540 --> 01:40:49.980]  There's humans that organize it, but there's an evil force that thought all this up.
[01:40:49.980 --> 01:40:52.180]  I think you hit the nail on the head earlier.
[01:40:52.180 --> 01:40:54.580]  Well, and you know, Alex, this is a real thing.
[01:40:54.580 --> 01:40:57.460]  And I really actually want to make this point, especially on your program.
[01:40:57.460 --> 01:41:02.100]  There's a lot of people on the alt right that want to blame Israel or blame a certain religion
[01:41:02.100 --> 01:41:06.860]  for all of their problems because, no, do not blame anybody else for your own problems.
[01:41:06.860 --> 01:41:09.620]  We're the author of our own autobiography.
[01:41:09.620 --> 01:41:12.140]  We could be a victim for a million different reasons.
[01:41:12.140 --> 01:41:14.020]  The medical industrial complex killed my mom.
[01:41:14.020 --> 01:41:18.780]  I could lay down and die and be a little baby back little girl about it and, you know, whine
[01:41:18.780 --> 01:41:20.380]  and make people feel sorry for me.
[01:41:20.380 --> 01:41:22.180]  But that's the opposite of what I want to do.
[01:41:22.180 --> 01:41:28.340]  So that's the that's the big problem in the society, Alex, is it's just that I keep talking
[01:41:28.340 --> 01:41:32.660]  about this, but you are in control of your own life.
[01:41:32.660 --> 01:41:33.660]  It is not the Illuminati.
[01:41:33.660 --> 01:41:35.140]  It's not the New World Order.
[01:41:35.140 --> 01:41:36.140]  All that stuff is happening.
[01:41:36.140 --> 01:41:37.680]  But you can create a family.
[01:41:37.680 --> 01:41:38.740]  You can create happiness.
[01:41:38.740 --> 01:41:43.460]  You can have a job or something you're passionate about and create art, create a podcast, create
[01:41:43.460 --> 01:41:45.500]  anything, create a family.
[01:41:45.500 --> 01:41:47.180]  You are in control.
[01:41:47.180 --> 01:41:48.180]  Not these people.
[01:41:48.180 --> 01:41:51.500]  They trick us into thinking that they have all the power, but we outnumber them.
[01:41:51.500 --> 01:41:55.300]  But that's really what I want to try to get to people, you know, whether you want you
[01:41:55.300 --> 01:41:59.820]  when you watch this, just realize we have all the power, not them, Alex.
[01:41:59.820 --> 01:42:01.620]  So we shouldn't be victims.
[01:42:01.620 --> 01:42:04.180]  I 100 percent agree with you about that.
[01:42:04.180 --> 01:42:08.340]  I want to come back and talk to you about this new legislation.
[01:42:08.340 --> 01:42:12.500]  Have you seen S six, eight, six yet?
[01:42:12.500 --> 01:42:13.500]  Which one is that?
[01:42:13.500 --> 01:42:17.420]  I saw that they're protesting about all that trans stuff at the Capitol, but is this the
[01:42:17.420 --> 01:42:18.420]  tech one?
[01:42:18.420 --> 01:42:19.420]  Is this a tick tock one?
[01:42:19.420 --> 01:42:20.420]  This is the tick tock one.
[01:42:20.420 --> 01:42:24.820]  And what I'm saying is this is the holy grail of control.
[01:42:24.820 --> 01:42:26.580]  It's everything we knew was coming.
[01:42:26.580 --> 01:42:30.180]  Total weaponized A.I. of civilization, A.I. running everything.
[01:42:30.180 --> 01:42:32.700]  They say, well, the Chinese are taking over the A.I.
[01:42:32.700 --> 01:42:36.980]  So our A.I. is to take over all your devices and watch you and protect you in a lifetime.
[01:42:36.980 --> 01:42:37.980]  It is.
[01:42:37.980 --> 01:42:38.980]  It is so crazy.
[01:42:38.980 --> 01:42:41.940]  I feel like I'm hallucinating when I read the bill.
[01:42:41.940 --> 01:42:46.380]  We'll look at it with Alex Stein, primetime ninety nine straight ahead.
[01:42:46.380 --> 01:42:47.380]  We love him to death.
[01:42:47.380 --> 01:42:48.380]  And we love you.
[01:42:48.380 --> 01:42:49.380]  We appreciate everybody.
[01:42:49.380 --> 01:42:50.380]  Alex Stein.
[01:42:50.380 --> 01:42:51.380]  Ninety nine.
[01:42:51.380 --> 01:42:52.380]  Stay with us.
[01:42:52.380 --> 01:43:00.900]  I'm a huge believer in information.
[01:43:00.900 --> 01:43:04.140]  I watch him for wars every day and follow Alex Jones closely.
[01:43:04.140 --> 01:43:05.140]  You know why?
[01:43:05.140 --> 01:43:06.140]  He can put you ahead of the curve.
[01:43:06.300 --> 01:43:09.940]  And he's been demonized as a conspiracy theorist.
[01:43:09.940 --> 01:43:13.340]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[01:43:13.340 --> 01:43:18.820]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[01:43:18.820 --> 01:43:21.980]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[01:43:21.980 --> 01:43:22.980]  This is reality.
[01:43:22.980 --> 01:43:24.980]  It just can't be.
[01:43:24.980 --> 01:43:27.380]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[01:43:27.380 --> 01:43:29.380]  The revolution of peaceful information is coming.
[01:43:29.380 --> 01:43:32.380]  And when it comes time, you people are going to be brought to punishment.
[01:43:32.380 --> 01:43:33.380]  You're lying to the public.
[01:43:33.380 --> 01:43:34.380]  It's disgusting.
[01:43:34.620 --> 01:43:37.620]  The media continues to misrepresent what I've said.
[01:43:37.620 --> 01:43:40.620]  He may be America's best known conspiracy theorist.
[01:43:40.620 --> 01:43:46.620]  Alex Jones has the largest audience in the country, bigger than any of the networks,
[01:43:46.620 --> 01:43:48.620]  the biggest megaphone in the country.
[01:43:48.620 --> 01:43:52.620]  We're going to get fired up about the real things, the things that matter.
[01:43:56.620 --> 01:43:58.620]  Burn in hell, New World Order.
[01:43:58.620 --> 01:44:03.220]  Every time I talk to you, you're either like on the border exposing the cartels and like
[01:44:03.220 --> 01:44:06.980]  coming under fire or you're on the streets of some American city hanging out with drug
[01:44:06.980 --> 01:44:07.980]  addicts and criminals.
[01:44:07.980 --> 01:44:11.340]  And now you've gone to ground zero of a massive chemical spill.
[01:44:11.340 --> 01:44:12.980]  Are you addicted to the danger, Savannah?
[01:44:12.980 --> 01:44:14.980]  Have you ever considered that for a second?
[01:44:14.980 --> 01:44:17.980]  No, I'm addicted to helping my fellow Americans.
[01:44:17.980 --> 01:44:19.980]  I'm addicted to spreading the truth.
[01:44:19.980 --> 01:44:21.980]  And again, you know, I have info wars to thank for that.
[01:44:21.980 --> 01:44:25.980]  Looking back on the day, I was able to ask President Donald Trump two questions.
[01:44:25.980 --> 01:44:30.980]  I was so grateful because, you know, I truly was classically trained under Alex Jones and
[01:44:30.980 --> 01:44:31.980]  under the info wars team.
[01:44:32.740 --> 01:44:37.740]  I really do credit that as to why I'm able to, you know, get these types of clips because
[01:44:37.740 --> 01:44:42.740]  Alex's whole mentality was, you know, go where the story is, go where the mainstream media
[01:44:42.740 --> 01:44:43.740]  refuses to.
[01:44:43.740 --> 01:44:45.740]  So it's not that I'm addicted to the insanity.
[01:44:45.740 --> 01:44:49.740]  I'm just addicted to telling the truth and helping the American people.
[01:44:49.740 --> 01:44:53.740]  And I really do credit Alex for, you know, really instilling that within me early on
[01:44:53.740 --> 01:44:54.740]  in my career.
[01:44:54.740 --> 01:45:02.740]  Thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United States government.
[01:45:02.740 --> 01:45:06.740]  A flying disk has been found and is now in the possession of the army.
[01:45:06.740 --> 01:45:08.740]  Here is a bulletin from CBS News.
[01:45:08.740 --> 01:45:10.740]  President Kennedy has been shot.
[01:45:10.740 --> 01:45:14.740]  This is a different kind of war.
[01:45:14.740 --> 01:45:18.740]  The USS Liberty had just been attacked by Israeli jets and competitors.
[01:45:18.740 --> 01:45:22.740]  The CIA could manipulate the news in the United States.
[01:45:22.740 --> 01:45:26.740]  They took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[01:45:26.740 --> 01:45:28.740]  It was almost as if it were a plan in full.
[01:45:28.740 --> 01:45:30.740]  It just tanked him.
[01:45:30.740 --> 01:45:32.740]  We need to go into the Capitol.
[01:45:32.740 --> 01:45:34.740]  Yes, yes, yes!
[01:45:34.740 --> 01:45:36.740]  We will always have conspiracy theories.
[01:45:36.740 --> 01:45:38.740]  They are nothing but distractions.
[01:45:38.740 --> 01:45:40.740]  You guys censored Harvard educated doctors.
[01:45:40.740 --> 01:45:42.740]  You silenced those voices.
[01:45:42.740 --> 01:45:46.740]  What we want to do in Davos is push the reset button.
[01:45:46.740 --> 01:45:52.740]  As soon as we start exposing the great reset, the sooner these globalists start going to
[01:45:52.740 --> 01:45:58.740]  prison!
[01:45:58.740 --> 01:46:02.740]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset in the War for the World, is a historic
[01:46:02.740 --> 01:46:07.740]  book that documents the globalists in their own words, plan for our future that is a hellish
[01:46:07.740 --> 01:46:08.740]  future.
[01:46:08.740 --> 01:46:11.740]  Now you will always, while they still allow books I guess, they are starting to ban them,
[01:46:11.740 --> 01:46:15.740]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset in the War for the World at bookstores,
[01:46:15.740 --> 01:46:17.740]  Amazon, or Infowarswar.com.
[01:46:17.740 --> 01:46:21.740]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies
[01:46:21.740 --> 01:46:23.740]  we got run out.
[01:46:23.740 --> 01:46:25.740]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[01:46:25.740 --> 01:46:30.740]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World a signed copy at Infowarswar.com.
[01:46:30.740 --> 01:46:34.740]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[01:46:34.740 --> 01:46:38.740]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know that
[01:46:38.740 --> 01:46:40.740]  you help keep Infowars on the air.
[01:46:40.740 --> 01:46:44.740]  I'm going to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned
[01:46:44.740 --> 01:46:49.740]  copies, but I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to Infowarswar.com
[01:46:49.740 --> 01:46:53.740]  and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate them to the library
[01:46:53.740 --> 01:46:55.740]  or give them to the local school.
[01:46:55.740 --> 01:46:56.740]  This is an Infowar.
[01:46:56.740 --> 01:46:59.740]  I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[01:46:59.740 --> 01:47:06.740]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:14.740 --> 01:47:40.740]  You know, Alex, I want to talk about solutions here with you and then some other news items.
[01:47:41.740 --> 01:47:43.740]  And this big A.I. takeover bill.
[01:47:43.740 --> 01:47:46.740]  I mean, that's, folks, you cannot exaggerate how bad this is.
[01:47:46.740 --> 01:47:50.740]  It is the holy grail of total control.
[01:47:50.740 --> 01:47:51.740]  It's so stunning.
[01:47:51.740 --> 01:47:54.740]  I can hardly even talk about it because during the breaks, I'm trying to read the legislation.
[01:47:54.740 --> 01:47:57.740]  It's worse than Tucker Carlson said last night.
[01:47:57.740 --> 01:47:58.740]  I'll be honest.
[01:47:58.740 --> 01:47:59.740]  Usually we break this.
[01:47:59.740 --> 01:48:00.740]  Tucker broke this last night.
[01:48:00.740 --> 01:48:03.740]  I knew the tick tock bill was bad, but I hadn't read it.
[01:48:03.740 --> 01:48:05.740]  It's just insane.
[01:48:05.740 --> 01:48:11.740]  When I say insane, folks, the government without warrants takes control of all devices everywhere
[01:48:11.740 --> 01:48:15.740]  in live time to protect you from the Chinese and surveil you.
[01:48:15.740 --> 01:48:18.740]  I mean, it's just with A.I., only A.I. can do this.
[01:48:18.740 --> 01:48:20.740]  It says A.I.
[01:48:20.740 --> 01:48:21.740]  And it lists everything.
[01:48:21.740 --> 01:48:27.740]  Like if you question an election, the government bans your devices where your home computer doesn't work.
[01:48:27.740 --> 01:48:34.740]  Remember like 15 years ago, they were mad at Napster and McCain introduced a bill and he went on TV
[01:48:34.740 --> 01:48:38.740]  and he said, we've got a bill that just blows up your computer.
[01:48:38.740 --> 01:48:40.740]  That doesn't physically blow it up.
[01:48:40.740 --> 01:48:41.740]  It fries it.
[01:48:41.740 --> 01:48:43.740]  That's what this is on steroids.
[01:48:43.740 --> 01:48:49.740]  OK, so I mean, right now, I am just flabbergasted.
[01:48:49.740 --> 01:48:51.740]  But I was talking here in the break.
[01:48:51.740 --> 01:48:59.740]  You want to get back into the Tennessee response versus the Texas response in Uvalde and how you talk about solutions.
[01:48:59.740 --> 01:49:06.740]  This is the action, not politically correct police, not cowards, not bureaucrats, but taking action.
[01:49:06.740 --> 01:49:12.740]  And sure, the cops are saying we just did our job, but in a world of cowards and people sitting on their ass,
[01:49:12.740 --> 01:49:15.740]  this is what the system fears is men of action.
[01:49:15.740 --> 01:49:17.740]  Alex Stein.
[01:49:17.740 --> 01:49:23.740]  Well, I sent your producer, Scott, a great guy, I sent him a picture of the Uvalde SWAT team.
[01:49:23.740 --> 01:49:27.740]  If you look at them, they look like a dictionary definition of intersectionalism.
[01:49:27.740 --> 01:49:33.740]  You know, it's everybody is, you know, some sort of ethnicity, you know, marginalized ethnicity.
[01:49:33.740 --> 01:49:36.740]  And that's the problem is that we don't have a meritocracy.
[01:49:36.740 --> 01:49:38.740]  But Alex, I actually want to talk about the A.I. real quick.
[01:49:38.740 --> 01:49:41.740]  You made a good point is that that's how they surveil us.
[01:49:41.740 --> 01:49:43.740]  But this is why the A.I. is even getting scarier.
[01:49:43.740 --> 01:49:46.740]  I'm not really necessarily worried about the A.I. becoming sentient.
[01:49:46.740 --> 01:49:47.740]  Not anytime soon.
[01:49:47.740 --> 01:49:49.740]  But we talk about the kids.
[01:49:49.740 --> 01:50:00.740]  I think it's like 85 percent of kids or students in colleges have used chat GPT in order to cheat or in order to, you know, help them study, which it seems OK.
[01:50:00.740 --> 01:50:02.740]  Right. In essence, that seems like it might be a good thing.
[01:50:02.740 --> 01:50:05.740]  They're trying to use technology to become, quote unquote, smarter.
[01:50:05.740 --> 01:50:06.740]  But that's what's happening now.
[01:50:06.740 --> 01:50:11.740]  They're having to create this counter artificial intelligence to catch the kids cheating.
[01:50:11.740 --> 01:50:13.740]  So now these kids can use artificial intelligence.
[01:50:13.740 --> 01:50:14.740]  They don't have to learn anything else.
[01:50:14.740 --> 01:50:16.740]  At least we just have to read a book.
[01:50:16.740 --> 01:50:18.740]  We had to actually write something, do something.
[01:50:18.740 --> 01:50:22.740]  Now with chat GPT and artificial intelligence, you can actually have a computer do it for you.
[01:50:22.740 --> 01:50:23.740]  And this picture is great.
[01:50:23.740 --> 01:50:27.740]  I just really want to say this picture is posted in 2020 of the Uvaldi SWAT team.
[01:50:27.740 --> 01:50:35.740]  And maybe I'm going to be honest, the only thing scarier than Uvaldi SWAT team would be if you walk into an airplane and you see two non-binary pilots.
[01:50:35.740 --> 01:50:41.740]  That's about the only thing more scary than this SWAT team, in my opinion, Alex.
[01:50:41.740 --> 01:50:47.740]  Well, all I know and I'm not Mr. Hero or anything, but if I knew there was a bunch of kids getting shot in the building,
[01:50:47.740 --> 01:50:50.740]  whether the cops are there or not, I got a gun, I'm going to go try to kill the person.
[01:50:50.740 --> 01:50:52.740]  I don't think of that as heroic.
[01:50:52.740 --> 01:50:56.740]  I have an instinct to want to protect children because I see somebody else's children like their mind.
[01:50:56.740 --> 01:50:58.740]  That's what empathy is.
[01:50:58.740 --> 01:51:00.740]  It's not some wimpy thing that we're taught.
[01:51:00.740 --> 01:51:07.740]  God gave it to us that if I see thugs beating up an old lady, I'm going to try to beat the hell out of them.
[01:51:07.740 --> 01:51:13.740]  And I'm not going to play games because I'm going to pick a metal sign up and smash it over their head because that's my grandma.
[01:51:13.740 --> 01:51:16.740]  I don't understand how people don't have an instinct.
[01:51:16.740 --> 01:51:18.740]  People ask, why do you fight? Why do you get involved?
[01:51:18.740 --> 01:51:21.740]  Well, I mean, it's because it's just what you're supposed to do.
[01:51:21.740 --> 01:51:25.740]  I don't even know how. I don't even see it as heroic. It's a default.
[01:51:25.740 --> 01:51:28.740]  No, I think you're exactly right.
[01:51:28.740 --> 01:51:32.740]  And you look at the word parents that tried to run in, Uvaldi, and they were stopped.
[01:51:32.740 --> 01:51:36.740]  They actually stopped parents from going in and protecting their own kids.
[01:51:36.740 --> 01:51:39.740]  I mean, it really is nonsensical.
[01:51:39.740 --> 01:51:42.740]  We live in the upside-down world, and I guess that becomes a cliché at this point.
[01:51:42.740 --> 01:51:47.740]  But when you see that response and then you watch the body cam footage of Nashville, it's just a night and day difference.
[01:51:47.740 --> 01:51:52.740]  Why they're taking on fire from an open window that the trans shooter shot out.
[01:51:52.740 --> 01:51:55.740]  So that's not an easy thing to run in there where you're getting shot at.
[01:51:55.740 --> 01:52:01.740]  So that response, we need more responses like that in the future when it comes to school shootings.
[01:52:01.740 --> 01:52:08.740]  And you notice this woman wanted to attack another school she'd gone to later in life, but cased the place and it had armed men at it.
[01:52:08.740 --> 01:52:10.740]  So she didn't go.
[01:52:10.740 --> 01:52:14.740]  Well, Alex, they always say this. There's no really defense to a suicide bomber.
[01:52:14.740 --> 01:52:18.740]  They told us that after 9-11. There's not much defense to a suicide shooter.
[01:52:18.740 --> 01:52:22.740]  Because if a person's willing to die for their cause, then they can usually take people out with them.
[01:52:22.740 --> 01:52:26.740]  And why would you want to go shoot little children?
[01:52:26.740 --> 01:52:32.740]  That's what I said, Alex. I'm yelling and screaming because when I got into work this morning, I was trying to think of the motivation.
[01:52:32.740 --> 01:52:36.740]  Why a child? I would have got it. Maybe she went to her ex-boyfriend, ex-girlfriend or something.
[01:52:36.740 --> 01:52:43.740]  Not that that's justified, but at least there's some sort of motivation. You hate somebody, a random kid, a random child of a pastor.
[01:52:43.740 --> 01:52:50.740]  I mean, there's nothing more evil and disgusting. I would hate to ever, when I die, my legacy be that I murdered a child.
[01:52:50.740 --> 01:52:57.740]  But because of this abortion, because they don't care about babies, you know, we catch people from Planned Parenthood literally taking home a fetus.
[01:52:57.740 --> 01:53:05.740]  And we're so desensitized to child death. People don't even care. And so I'm just so astonished.
[01:53:05.740 --> 01:53:17.740]  And by the way, before we end this, I forgot to tell the crew, I just so happened Saturday to be in the car with my wife listening to Mark Passio's new podcast like last week.
[01:53:17.740 --> 01:53:23.740]  And he was saying, Mark, my words, mass shootings are imminent because this is a satanic energy running this.
[01:53:23.740 --> 01:53:28.740]  It doesn't even need to have orders from headquarters. The spring is the time of satanic sacrifice.
[01:53:28.740 --> 01:53:34.740]  There will be mass shootings. And he said these people are basically spiritually controlled to go do this and predicted it.
[01:53:34.740 --> 01:53:41.740]  And, you know, it's really true. I mean, this is a spiritual force that drives these people to want to hurt children.
[01:53:41.740 --> 01:53:49.740]  Well, Alex, I mean, it really comes down to what they teach kids in school is that they evolved from pond scum that were some sort of cosmic accident, that there is no creator.
[01:53:49.740 --> 01:53:54.740]  So once you have every kid, they're either, you know, autistic from, you know, horrible medications.
[01:53:54.740 --> 01:54:00.740]  And then if they're not autistic, they're taught that their life is meaningless and that there's no consequences for their actions.
[01:54:00.740 --> 01:54:04.740]  So when they hurt people, it doesn't matter because it was all just, you know, funny joke.
[01:54:04.740 --> 01:54:08.740]  It was all just a meaningless experience when that's not the case.
[01:54:08.740 --> 01:54:14.740]  And we know that God created this earth that we're on. I mean, this world that we live in, there is a creator.
[01:54:14.740 --> 01:54:19.740]  But because they hide the creator, that is demonic. That is satanic.
[01:54:19.740 --> 01:54:27.740]  And that's why these people are so confused. And that's why they think, oh, well, if I worship the devil like Sam Smith and I listen to Lil Nas X, I'm cool.
[01:54:27.740 --> 01:54:31.740]  I'm edgy. And that's where the brainwashing starts. And it's just like saying safe and effective.
[01:54:31.740 --> 01:54:41.740]  Once you just use repetition enough, you can convince and trick a person to do anything or morally think that they are in the right when they're actually shooting children.
[01:54:41.740 --> 01:54:46.740]  Because I don't know how Aubrey felt, but Aubrey was planning this. They had a manifesto.
[01:54:46.740 --> 01:54:53.740]  So this is not just a random attack. They wanted to go hurt children with a calculated plan to do so.
[01:54:53.740 --> 01:54:57.740]  Nothing is more evil or demonic or satanic than that.
[01:54:57.740 --> 01:55:02.740]  Alex Stein, we want to thank you so much for joining us just briefly.
[01:55:02.740 --> 01:55:09.740]  And when you start the next segment, I'm going to play a little bit more Tucker Carlson's breakdown of Senate Bill 686, the RESTRICT Act.
[01:55:09.740 --> 01:55:16.740]  And then Dr. Stella Emanuel is going to be in studio with us with a wonderful lady coming up with a great supporter of the broadcast, by the way.
[01:55:16.740 --> 01:55:21.740]  So she's going to be in here with us to cover the waterfront in the next hour.
[01:55:21.740 --> 01:55:25.740]  And then obviously the war room, 3 p.m. Central. Today I'll have open phones.
[01:55:25.740 --> 01:55:30.740]  I tend to have open phones today, but have a bunch of guests on. Tomorrow we'll be taking open phones as well.
[01:55:30.740 --> 01:55:35.740]  But this bill, you've got to get on this. And I'm saying that because I'm just now getting on it.
[01:55:35.740 --> 01:55:46.740]  It literally says in here, any questioning of elections, we take over the devices in your house, the government without a warrant, so you can't say it.
[01:55:46.740 --> 01:55:53.740]  So forget Internet passwords, forget Internet IDs, forget that level of censorship that we thought was the coup de grace for them.
[01:55:53.740 --> 01:55:59.740]  This is the control of all the devices in the name of stopping the Chinese.
[01:55:59.740 --> 01:56:02.740]  Oh, the Chinese might be able to break into your computer.
[01:56:02.740 --> 01:56:09.740]  So we're just going to break into everything by law so that we're going to be your guardian.
[01:56:09.740 --> 01:56:14.740]  We're going to totally put you in chains and lock you up and enslave you for your own good.
[01:56:14.740 --> 01:56:17.740]  I mean, this is the definition of insane.
[01:56:17.740 --> 01:56:21.740]  Yeah, Alex, they're going to take away your privacy under the guise of safety.
[01:56:21.740 --> 01:56:24.740]  So you're going to keep you safe by you having no privacy.
[01:56:24.740 --> 01:56:29.740]  And we signed the Patriot Act, you know, 21 years ago or however long ago that was, 22 years ago when we signed that.
[01:56:29.740 --> 01:56:32.740]  That gives the government warrantless search and seizure of our phones.
[01:56:32.740 --> 01:56:43.740]  Now these Chinese apps, of course, they're just mad, Alex, because TikTok is dominating and probably because TikTok wasn't created by the CIA like Facebook or Twitter or all the social media platforms that we use.
[01:56:43.740 --> 01:56:52.740]  So I think now they're just having to put in this legislation as basically a safety net because China created a app that we get incredibly addicted to because it's like a slot machine.
[01:56:52.740 --> 01:56:53.740]  It gives you the likes.
[01:56:53.740 --> 01:56:54.740]  So then you have the dope.
[01:56:54.740 --> 01:56:56.740]  You have the dopamine hormonal response.
[01:56:56.740 --> 01:56:57.740]  You get the likes.
[01:56:57.740 --> 01:57:02.740]  And TikTok is better than any other platform by organically having other people see your content.
[01:57:02.740 --> 01:57:05.740]  So you can be just Joe Blow working at a diner.
[01:57:05.740 --> 01:57:06.740]  You post a video of your sandwich.
[01:57:06.740 --> 01:57:08.740]  Next thing you know, you're viral.
[01:57:08.740 --> 01:57:09.740]  And that is addicting.
[01:57:09.740 --> 01:57:11.740]  And that is a form of hypnosis.
[01:57:11.740 --> 01:57:13.740]  So people are looking at the screen.
[01:57:13.740 --> 01:57:17.740]  This black mirror, Alex, until we defeat the black mirror, that's my cat Skybear, but let me close it.
[01:57:17.740 --> 01:57:23.740]  I'm saying until we stop the black mirror, Alex, we're going to be constantly just looking at the reflection of our demonic soul.
[01:57:23.740 --> 01:57:24.740]  And that's what this screen is.
[01:57:24.740 --> 01:57:29.740]  It's just it's basically a representation of the dark side every time we look at it.
[01:57:29.740 --> 01:57:31.740]  Well said, Alex Stein.
[01:57:31.740 --> 01:57:34.740]  Everybody can find you on the Blaze weeknights.
[01:57:34.740 --> 01:57:35.740]  You gotta cover my show!
[01:57:35.740 --> 01:57:37.740]  You gotta cover my show, Alex.
[01:57:37.740 --> 01:57:38.740]  I gotta have you on.
[01:57:38.740 --> 01:57:39.740]  Please, please.
[01:57:39.740 --> 01:57:40.740]  I was on Crowder in Dallas last week.
[01:57:40.740 --> 01:57:41.740]  You name the time.
[01:57:41.740 --> 01:57:42.740]  All right.
[01:57:42.740 --> 01:57:44.740]  Another great guest in studio.
[01:57:44.740 --> 01:57:45.740]  But first, more Tucker Carlson.
[01:58:10.740 --> 01:58:12.740]  Alex Jones was right.
[01:58:12.740 --> 01:58:16.740]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[01:58:16.740 --> 01:58:20.740]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[01:58:20.740 --> 01:58:24.740]  Alex Jones called this years ago, years ago.
[01:58:24.740 --> 01:58:27.740]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second.
[01:58:27.740 --> 01:58:30.740]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[01:58:30.740 --> 01:58:33.740]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[01:58:33.740 --> 01:58:36.740]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[01:58:36.740 --> 01:58:41.740]  That's why the globalists hate me is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[01:59:07.740 --> 01:59:11.740]  And now, the fourth toothpaste that's on my dad, the last two were big hits.
[01:59:11.740 --> 01:59:12.740]  This one is really special.
[01:59:12.740 --> 01:59:18.740]  It's turmeric concentrate with a bunch of other essential oils and so much more to take your mouth's health to the next level.

[01:59:26.740 --> 01:59:29.740]  And we have ashwagandha root gummies as well.
[01:59:29.740 --> 01:59:31.740]  Very strong, very powerful.

[01:59:51.740 --> 01:59:56.740]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:59:58.740 --> 01:59:59.740]  Let's take a closer look.
[01:59:59.740 --> 02:00:05.740]  And again, this is not a defensive TikTok, merely an acknowledgement of what's actually happening in Washington right now.
[02:00:05.740 --> 02:00:10.740]  So one of the bills that would ban TikTok is being pushed, as we said, by senators in both parties.
[02:00:10.740 --> 02:00:11.740]  It's called the RESTRICT Act.
[02:00:11.740 --> 02:00:18.740]  Mark Warner of Virginia and John Thune of South Dakota, Democrat and Republican, introduced this legislation.
[02:00:18.740 --> 02:00:29.740]  Now, the bill is extensively protecting American national security and ending, quote, foreign adversaries from interfering in our election through apps like TikTok.
[02:00:29.740 --> 02:00:33.740]  Because, of course, election interference by Twitter and Facebook is no problem at all.
[02:00:33.740 --> 02:00:36.740]  But election interference from TikTok is totally unacceptable.
[02:00:36.740 --> 02:00:37.740]  OK.
[02:00:37.740 --> 02:00:44.740]  But in reality, and you should know this if you're opposed to TikTok, as we are, this bill isn't really about banning TikTok.
[02:00:44.740 --> 02:00:46.740]  It's never about what they say it is.
[02:00:46.740 --> 02:00:57.740]  Instead, this bill would give enormous and terrifying new powers to the federal government to punish American citizens and regulate how they communicate with one another.
[02:00:57.740 --> 02:01:05.740]  For example, the bill would regulate, quote, certain transactions between persons in the United States and foreign adversaries.
[02:01:05.740 --> 02:01:08.740]  Now, what's a foreign adversary and who gets to decide?
[02:01:09.740 --> 02:01:18.740]  Oh, well, the secretary of commerce and the department in the DNI, not the Congress, get to decide what foreign adversaries are.
[02:01:18.740 --> 02:01:21.740]  Well, that ought to trip a switch in your brain.
[02:01:21.740 --> 02:01:34.740]  And then the transactions with foreign adversaries would include, quote, any acquisition, importation, transfer, installation, dealing in or use of any information and communications, technology, product or service,
[02:01:34.740 --> 02:01:42.740]  including ongoing activities such as mandated services, data transmission, software updates, repairs or the provision of data hosting services.
[02:01:42.740 --> 02:01:43.740]  Well, that's pretty broad.
[02:01:43.740 --> 02:01:52.740]  Under this bill, if you engage in any of that with a so-called foreign adversary, as determined by, in this case, the Biden administration, that would allow the secretary of commerce,
[02:01:52.740 --> 02:02:00.740]  Gina Raimondo, and the director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, to decide whether you're acting in the, quote, interest of a foreign adversary.
[02:02:00.740 --> 02:02:07.740]  Again, that's another term that the executive branch of secretary of commerce gets to define without the interference of Congress.
[02:02:07.740 --> 02:02:25.740]  So if the Biden administration decides that you're doing this, then the secretary of commerce can then enforce, quote, any mitigation measure to address any risk arising from any covered transaction with any person or with respect to any property subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.
[02:02:26.740 --> 02:02:33.740]  These covered transactions can involve, quote, current past or potential future transactions.
[02:02:33.740 --> 02:02:41.740]  And the mitigation member measures include, but are not limited to, throwing American citizens in prison for 20 years.
[02:02:41.740 --> 02:02:43.740]  Think about that for a minute.
[02:02:43.740 --> 02:02:49.740]  So you would be allowing the executive branch, the Biden administration, to regulate speech on the Internet.
[02:02:49.740 --> 02:02:58.740]  And if you are somehow involved with a, quote, foreign adversary or let's say you oppose the war against Russia, you go to prison for 20 years.
[02:02:58.740 --> 02:03:03.740]  So this isn't about banning TikTok.
[02:03:03.740 --> 02:03:07.740]  This is about introducing flat out totalitarianism into our system.
[02:03:07.740 --> 02:03:13.740]  Now, just because TikTok is so unappealing, because it's a creepy low IQ Chinese plot designed to make our kids trans.
[02:03:13.740 --> 02:03:15.740]  And it is.
[02:03:15.740 --> 02:03:20.740]  That does not mean that the people trying to ban TikTok have your interests in mind.
[02:03:20.740 --> 02:03:21.740]  Oh, it definitely doesn't.
[02:03:21.740 --> 02:03:22.740]  Or America's.
[02:03:22.740 --> 02:03:29.740]  Keep in mind, these are exactly the same people who drained our strategic petroleum reserve and in fact promote China at every turn.
[02:03:29.740 --> 02:03:31.740]  Now they're telling you they're against China.
[02:03:31.740 --> 02:03:32.740]  They're not.
[02:03:32.740 --> 02:03:35.740]  This is not an effort to push back against China.
[02:03:36.740 --> 02:03:46.740]  It's part of a strategy to make America much more like China with the government in charge of what you read and see and with terrifying punitive powers at their fingertips.
[02:03:46.740 --> 02:03:53.740]  Now, we've seen this before from the national security state again and again, confronted with a foreign adversary, for example, after 9-11.
[02:03:53.740 --> 02:04:04.740]  The federal government uses the opportunity to expand their police powers over the American population, and they do it under false pretext and they do it quickly by whipping people into a panic.
[02:04:04.740 --> 02:04:08.740]  Now, in a country that's rooted in some truth, TikTok is bad. Sure.
[02:04:08.740 --> 02:04:11.740]  Al Qaeda was terrible. Of course.
[02:04:11.740 --> 02:04:15.740]  But these measures are not aimed at stopping the foreign threat.
[02:04:15.740 --> 02:04:17.740]  They're aimed at controlling the American population.
[02:04:17.740 --> 02:04:19.740]  They rush it through.
[02:04:19.740 --> 02:04:25.740]  And they do it so quickly that no one ever explains how exactly this has preserved American national security.
[02:04:25.740 --> 02:04:29.740]  Now, according to Sandy Cortez, we really quote her.
[02:04:29.740 --> 02:04:33.740]  Congress has not even been briefed on any of this. Watch.
[02:04:33.740 --> 02:04:45.740]  Usually, when the United States is proposing a very major move that has something to do with significant risk to national security, one of the first things that happens is that Congress receives a classified briefing.
[02:04:45.740 --> 02:04:48.740]  And I can tell you that Congress has not received a classified briefing.
[02:04:48.740 --> 02:04:53.740]  All right, folks. We'll be talking more about this legislation, S-686.
[02:04:53.740 --> 02:04:57.740]  Dr. Stella, Emanuel's in studio with us. Please stay with us. This is going to be a powerful interview.
[02:04:58.740 --> 02:05:06.740]  If Alex Jones runs for president in the Republican Party, he has a chance of winning.
[02:05:09.740 --> 02:05:14.740]  If you just tuned in, you may be noticing I'm wearing an Alex Jones for president 2024 shirt.
[02:05:14.740 --> 02:05:19.740]  I am not seriously planning to run for president. This is an idea the crew had.
[02:05:19.740 --> 02:05:22.740]  I have a triggering shirt, kind of next level. Alex Jones is right.
[02:05:22.740 --> 02:05:26.740]  There's Infowars.com in the back. Alex Jones for president 2024 on the front.
[02:05:26.740 --> 02:05:30.740]  It's a fundraiser shirt. It's made out of really nice fabric. It's high quality.
[02:05:30.740 --> 02:05:33.740]  And it is an exclusive shirt to Infowarsstore.com.
[02:05:33.740 --> 02:05:41.740]  And when the shirts are gone, they're gone. We're doing one run of Alex Jones for president 2024 shirts.
[02:05:41.740 --> 02:05:48.740]  And we'll have a historic memento, be able to spread the word, meet a lot of like-minded people, and he will be able to keep us on the air.
[02:05:48.740 --> 02:05:55.740]  No way. No way. That's a bridge too far. No, it can't be. And I said on national television that he was going to win.
[02:05:55.740 --> 02:05:58.740]  At Infowarsstore.com.
[02:06:12.740 --> 02:06:15.740]  Well, that was an amazing interview with Alex Stein last hour.
[02:06:15.740 --> 02:06:20.740]  And I think we may top it with Dr. Stella Emanuel. Drstellamd.com.
[02:06:20.740 --> 02:06:22.740]  What an amazing lady, a fellow Texan.
[02:06:22.740 --> 02:06:30.740]  And she was one of the first and most outspoken doctors with the different alternative treatments that have saved millions of people.
[02:06:30.740 --> 02:06:33.740]  She helped educate President Trump and so many others.
[02:06:33.740 --> 02:06:41.740]  Stella Emanuel, M.D.'s successful physician with an active practice in the Houston, as well as the founder of Firepower Ministries in Katy, Texas.
[02:06:41.740 --> 02:06:48.740]  She devotes her life and resources to teaching believers everywhere to identify the sources of spiritual weakness, deception, and defeat.
[02:06:48.740 --> 02:06:55.740]  To learn strategies of warfare to enable them to get and maintain their freedom. Drstellamd.com.
[02:06:55.740 --> 02:06:59.740]  And she talks about the spiritual war we're in. She gets made fun of that.
[02:06:59.740 --> 02:07:05.740]  But let me tell you, the people running things know that this is a spiritual war.
[02:07:05.740 --> 02:07:11.740]  And I agree with her that we're entering the end times, world governments being announced, global digital currency.
[02:07:11.740 --> 02:07:20.740]  They're now announcing AI of mainstream articles to interface with all our computers outside of law to control everything we do.
[02:07:20.740 --> 02:07:25.740]  I mean, it is all moving quick. The dam is collapsed. We've gone from beta to operational.
[02:07:25.740 --> 02:07:30.740]  And I got to tell you, behind the scenes, people don't know this. She's been a huge supporter of Infowars.
[02:07:30.740 --> 02:07:34.740]  We would not be on air without her. She's been one of those very quiet people behind the scenes.
[02:07:34.740 --> 02:07:43.740]  That has been an incredible supporter. And she is a dynamo, treating hundreds of thousands of people and putting them in contact with folks to get treatment during COVID.
[02:07:43.740 --> 02:07:51.740]  And her main mission is, I've been asking her for months, she finally had time, is that they're planning a new pandemic, a new fear, a new control.
[02:07:51.740 --> 02:07:59.740]  We've got to be ready this time or they can take over using it. So, doctor, I salute you. It's great to see you and your family here.
[02:07:59.740 --> 02:08:01.740]  God bless you. And just take it away.
[02:08:01.740 --> 02:08:07.740]  I'm so honored to be here. I'm very honored to be here. Alex, you've been at this battle years ago when you would speak.
[02:08:07.740 --> 02:08:13.740]  People thought it was. You were conspiracy theories, but everything has come to pass. Sometimes we don't want to be right, but we end up being right.
[02:08:13.740 --> 02:08:20.740]  And it's really sad. You know, one of the things I will say is that we are in a battle, we're in a spiritual battle.
[02:08:20.740 --> 02:08:28.740]  And that is being done physically or medically or politically or anything. And then there's a divide.
[02:08:28.740 --> 02:08:34.740]  There's a dichotomy like the church that know how to fight spiritual battle. They don't have information.
[02:08:34.740 --> 02:08:43.740]  And then the patriots that are fighting the battle and know and understand the evil, most of them don't understand warfare.
[02:08:43.740 --> 02:08:52.740]  So there has to be a merging of what the church knows in warfare and what the patriots know in information and what's happening.
[02:08:52.740 --> 02:08:59.740]  So that's just part of the stuff that we do right now and getting people to be prepared because these people are not going to stop.
[02:08:59.740 --> 02:09:03.740]  They're going to make sure that they're not stopping. They're just bringing one after another.
[02:09:03.740 --> 02:09:10.740]  Right now, people are still focused on COVID and focused on the job and focused on those that are sick, focused on those that are shedding on other people.
[02:09:10.740 --> 02:09:15.740]  But they've moved the battle line. We're right now, they're looking at, we're looking at FED now, CBDCs.
[02:09:15.740 --> 02:09:21.740]  That's where we are right now. And people are not ready. We're looking at famine coming. We're in Revelation 6 and people are not ready.
[02:09:21.740 --> 02:09:28.740]  So I'm here to tell people get ready. We cannot wait. We cannot be captured again just without thinking, you know.
[02:09:28.740 --> 02:09:32.740]  So people need to be ready physically. They need to be ready spiritually. They need to have food and water.
[02:09:32.740 --> 02:09:39.740]  They need to have the medications that they need. They need to be ready for COVID or any other pandemic. So that's kind of what we do.
[02:09:39.740 --> 02:09:44.740]  I totally agree because people think, OK, we had three years of hell. Now let's go out and have some fun.
[02:09:45.740 --> 02:09:53.740]  We're just getting a short respite, almost like when you get sucked under by a riptide and you pop back up and get one second of air where you get sucked back down.
[02:09:53.740 --> 02:10:00.740]  I mean, you can see them, the UN, the globalists admit ha ha ha. Our new super virus is about to come out. We'll get control. We'll lock them down again.
[02:10:00.740 --> 02:10:05.740]  I mean, they are licking their lips. Why is the devil moving so quick right now?
[02:10:05.740 --> 02:10:12.740]  The Bible says that he has a short time. It's like he's throwing, he's throwing just about everything at humanity because he has a short time.
[02:10:12.740 --> 02:10:22.740]  But Alex, I do believe that initially they thought they were going to hit us in 2020 and within a few months everybody will be like, get ready to get jabbed and get overtaken.
[02:10:22.740 --> 02:10:33.740]  But God in his infinite mercy called us out to speak out like that day on 2020 when I stood in front of the Supreme Court with the American front line doctors, something happened.
[02:10:33.740 --> 02:10:35.740]  Out of all the great daughters, you were the very first up there.
[02:10:35.740 --> 02:10:43.740]  Yeah, something broke. It was like poof, something broke in the spirit. Humanity ran out. God just showed us mercy and used my voice that day.
[02:10:43.740 --> 02:10:51.740]  When I got up from home, I live in Houston, when I got up going to DC, I called my family. I said, I cannot allow people to die.
[02:10:51.740 --> 02:10:57.740]  I cannot see a disease that is treatable and we treated over 350 patients at that time and just allowed people to die.
[02:10:57.740 --> 02:11:04.740]  So I went, I called them, I sat them down. I said, I'm going to DC. I might not make it back. If they kill me, so be it. If I perish, I perish.
[02:11:04.740 --> 02:11:15.740]  So at the time I stood in front of that day, I was ready to perish if I had to. But God in his infinite mercy just wanted to give us a little respite or a little fighting chance.
[02:11:15.740 --> 02:11:22.740]  So because I wasn't afraid, I just went off, crazy off. And of course the Lord took it and spread it all over the world.
[02:11:22.740 --> 02:11:28.740]  And I forget though, I saw him in the news about you. The number of people you helped is just astronomical.
[02:11:28.740 --> 02:11:37.740]  Yes, we've sent over 100 and something thousand patients now, but people have influenced places that we've sent our protocols all over the world.
[02:11:37.740 --> 02:11:50.740]  We've sent our protocols to doctors like all over the world. You know, recently Medscape did a hit piece on me saying, oh, I have prescribed hundreds and over 100,000 hydroxychloroquine and over 80,000 or so ivermectin.
[02:11:50.740 --> 02:11:56.740]  And I just told him, I said, we have a doctor team that is working and we're not just going to let the American people die.
[02:11:56.740 --> 02:12:04.740]  So it's only eternity that would give a whole idea of what God used us to do. And we're still here making sure.
[02:12:04.740 --> 02:12:09.740]  Till today, Alex, people are still dying from COVID, which doesn't make any sense. Every time I hear...
[02:12:09.740 --> 02:12:17.740]  They're still sending them home, giving them treatment. And I want to speak to that because I see numbers out of Australia, the UK, the numbers are higher than they were two years ago.
[02:12:18.740 --> 02:12:28.740]  So and people that are jabbed are getting COVID two, three, four times, getting it over and over. And it just it's annoying and it just hurts.
[02:12:28.740 --> 02:12:35.740]  People are talking, talking, but there's something that we're actually just COVID in particular. We're ignoring early treatment.
[02:12:35.740 --> 02:12:42.740]  I tell everybody, get hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin in your medicine cabinet. Don't wait till you're sick. Don't wait till you can't breathe.
[02:12:42.740 --> 02:12:46.740]  Don't wait till you're in front of the hospital and then you call me to come and get you.
[02:12:46.740 --> 02:12:49.740]  People call me at 3 a.m. Don't pay money. Can you go get my father out of the hospital? I can't.
[02:12:49.740 --> 02:12:55.740]  Sure. Well, I raised this with everybody I have on, Dr. Peter McCullough, you name it. But I know that you've done a lot of research.
[02:12:55.740 --> 02:13:01.740]  Why does Africa have the lowest COVID death rate and the lowest vaccine rate? What was different in Africa?
[02:13:01.740 --> 02:13:08.740]  Because even Associated Press admits, why didn't Africa really have COVID? Or what was the difference?
[02:13:08.740 --> 02:13:15.740]  Because I was reading Africa already knew about hydroxychloroquine and the so-called horse pace.
[02:13:15.740 --> 02:13:23.740]  Yes, I guess horse pace. So what happened in Africa when when the people left Wuhan and seeded COVID all over the world?
[02:13:23.740 --> 02:13:32.740]  COVID was seeded into Nigeria at the same time. It's just that when you travel out of any country and you're going to sub-Saharan Africa,
[02:13:32.740 --> 02:13:39.740]  they tell you to take anti-malarias. So they are taking anti-malarias, kind of knock the COVID out of their system.
[02:13:39.740 --> 02:13:45.740]  And there's a culture we have back home because we live in a malaria endemic area.
[02:13:45.740 --> 02:13:51.740]  Once somebody gets a fever, a cough and a cold, they go over the counter, they get malaria medicine.
[02:13:51.740 --> 02:13:57.740]  If it's mefloquine, camoquin, flavoquin, any of the queens. And they get anti-malarias and they take it.
[02:13:57.740 --> 02:14:02.740]  So they were not trying to treat COVID. They were just trying to treat malaria like everybody does.
[02:14:02.740 --> 02:14:06.740]  You get a little fever, you get a little cold, you go get anti-malarias. So that is why the numbers were very...
[02:14:06.740 --> 02:14:08.740]  But that place sank into those cells.
[02:14:08.740 --> 02:14:14.740]  Yes. So that just kind of stopped the thing from spreading like it should. And it just stopped it.
[02:14:14.740 --> 02:14:19.740]  You see, most of the deaths that happen in Africa, happen in South Africa.
[02:14:19.740 --> 02:14:26.740]  Because two things, South Africa is not malaria endemic. Number two, you need a prescription to get hydroxychloroquine or ivermectin
[02:14:26.740 --> 02:14:34.740]  so people could not get it over the counter. Most of the other parts of Africa, especially in the equatorial area, they have malaria.
[02:14:34.740 --> 02:14:39.740]  So of all the therapeutics you promoted, which one is the most powerful in your view?
[02:14:39.740 --> 02:14:45.740]  I use hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin. They are equally powerful. They work well, both of them.
[02:14:45.740 --> 02:14:48.740]  And ivermectin on those being all over the world, not just Africa.
[02:14:48.740 --> 02:14:53.740]  Yes, it's used. Ivermectin is one of the medicines that WHO called a great medicine for every...
[02:14:53.740 --> 02:14:54.740]  Miracle.
[02:14:54.740 --> 02:14:55.740]  A miracle drug.
[02:14:55.740 --> 02:14:56.740]  But suddenly it's no good.
[02:14:56.740 --> 02:15:03.740]  Suddenly it's bad and it can kill you. So it's hospice. So there are a lot of... People need to understand.
[02:15:03.740 --> 02:15:13.740]  I ask doctors and I ask people, if you think these people are not evil, why would they refuse a medicine that can treat people?
[02:15:13.740 --> 02:15:19.740]  Well, look at them making fun of it, saying it's a belief system. When didn't the guy that invented ivermectin win the Nobel Prize?
[02:15:19.740 --> 02:15:20.740]  Yes.
[02:15:21.740 --> 02:15:27.740]  So real briefly, we're going to break here, Doc, but can we come back? What does ivermectin do? What does hydroxychloroquine do?
[02:15:27.740 --> 02:15:29.740]  And then you're telling people, get ready now.
[02:15:29.740 --> 02:15:35.740]  Now, get it now. Go to our website, DrStellarMD.com. Get it now. Don't wait until you are sick.
[02:15:35.740 --> 02:15:41.740]  I got to tell you, my dad was going to die. And as soon as I got him ivermectin and stuff, it turned around in hours.
[02:15:41.740 --> 02:15:42.740]  Amen.
[02:15:42.740 --> 02:15:46.740]  Of course, my dad's a tough guy. He didn't tell me. He was sick, in bed, about to die for a week.
[02:15:46.740 --> 02:15:51.740]  By the time I got there, he was almost dead. His oxygen was down at 90%, or even lower.
[02:15:51.740 --> 02:15:53.740]  We'll be right back. Stay with us, Dr. Stella Emanuel.
[02:16:17.740 --> 02:16:20.740]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[02:16:20.740 --> 02:16:21.740]  This is reality.
[02:16:21.740 --> 02:16:23.740]  It just can't help.
[02:16:23.740 --> 02:16:25.740]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[02:16:25.740 --> 02:16:30.740]  The revolution of peaceful information is coming, and when it comes time, you people are going to be brought into punishment.
[02:16:30.740 --> 02:16:32.740]  You're lying to the public. It's disgusting.
[02:16:32.740 --> 02:16:36.740]  The media continues to misrepresent what I've said.
[02:16:36.740 --> 02:16:39.740]  He may be America's best known conspiracy theorist.
[02:16:39.740 --> 02:16:47.740]  Alex Jones has the largest audience in the country, bigger than any of the networks, the biggest megaphone in the country.
[02:16:47.740 --> 02:16:51.740]  We're going to get fired up about the real things, the things that matter!
[02:16:55.740 --> 02:16:57.740]  Burn in hell, New World Order.
[02:16:58.740 --> 02:17:03.740]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had. I don't think anybody can deny it.
[02:17:03.740 --> 02:17:07.740]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[02:17:07.740 --> 02:17:16.740]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[02:17:16.740 --> 02:17:24.740]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[02:17:24.740 --> 02:17:28.740]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[02:17:28.740 --> 02:17:34.740]  And I want to encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[02:17:34.740 --> 02:17:37.740]  I know you spread the word. I know you pray for us. That's wonderful. Keep doing it.
[02:17:37.740 --> 02:17:44.740]  But most viewers and listeners never go to infoarsetour.com and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[02:17:44.740 --> 02:17:46.740]  All at the same time, keep us on air.
[02:17:46.740 --> 02:17:50.740]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at infoarsetour.com.
[02:17:50.740 --> 02:17:56.740]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to infoarsetour.com, our funding problems will be over. Please take action now.
[02:17:56.740 --> 02:17:59.740]  There is a war for the future happening right now.
[02:18:00.740 --> 02:18:04.740]  There is a war that will control my destiny, your destiny, our children's destiny.
[02:18:04.740 --> 02:18:09.740]  And that war is something that we can win, but it takes dedication. It takes commitment.
[02:18:09.740 --> 02:18:20.740]  That's why I ask listeners respectfully to go to infoarsetour.com and buy great products that will enrich and empower your life while keeping us on air at the very same time.
[02:18:20.740 --> 02:18:27.740]  Go to infoarsetour.com to get a signed or unsigned copy of my book, The Great Reset in the War for the World.
[02:18:27.740 --> 02:18:36.740]  Ultimate Bone Broth, Back in Stock, Nitric Boost, the amazing CBD oil we have that's the highest quality you're going to find anywhere at more than half off.
[02:18:36.740 --> 02:18:41.740]  It's all available at infoarsetour.com, some of the very best products.
[02:18:41.740 --> 02:18:43.740]  And a lot of you have never shopped at Infowarsetour.
[02:18:43.740 --> 02:18:48.740]  You've been watching for years, you've been listening for years, but you've never taken the step to go to Infowarsetour.
[02:18:48.740 --> 02:18:52.740]  These are great products that really work and are amazing. Plus, they keep us on air.
[02:18:52.740 --> 02:18:57.740]  So again, please take action. Go to infoarsetour.com today. I thank you.
[02:18:59.740 --> 02:19:05.740]  It's hard to believe that we're already going into March 2023 and the world is an insane place.
[02:19:05.740 --> 02:19:09.740]  World War Three has already started. Biden is a puppet and is dissolving our borders.
[02:19:09.740 --> 02:19:13.740]  There's mass censorship. James O'Keefe has been removed from Project Veritas.
[02:19:13.740 --> 02:19:15.740]  The list goes on and on of the bad things that are happening.
[02:19:15.740 --> 02:19:19.740]  But the good things that are happening is humanity is really accelerating its awakening.
[02:19:19.740 --> 02:19:23.740]  But those of us on the forefront are under more attack by the establishment than ever.
[02:19:23.740 --> 02:19:28.740]  That's why I'm counting on you to spread the word about the broadcast, to pray for the broadcast,

[02:19:58.740 --> 02:20:04.740]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:12.740 --> 02:20:32.740]  Well, she didn't want to talk about this today, but I've been trying to get her on since she was on a few months ago.
[02:20:32.740 --> 02:20:40.740]  This lady, without asking behind the scenes, has really been a big supporter and made some big donations to Info Wars.
[02:20:40.740 --> 02:20:45.740]  And I know so many people personally that she's helped. She is a prolific medical doctor,
[02:20:45.740 --> 02:20:50.740]  and you all saw her in the first wave of doctors before all the other big doctors came out, who we love as well.
[02:20:50.740 --> 02:20:54.740]  And she devastated them and dominated those press conferences,
[02:20:54.740 --> 02:21:03.740]  and has served over 100,000 people with what happened when they tried to block the therapeutics, these mass murdering criminals.
[02:21:03.740 --> 02:21:08.740]  And so, I want you to bring this up, because I get so many calls, we promote a lot of other groups,
[02:21:08.740 --> 02:21:12.740]  and people will be able to support themselves and be healthy, but I totally agree with you.
[02:21:12.740 --> 02:21:16.740]  I can't tell you how many people don't know how to get help,
[02:21:16.740 --> 02:21:20.740]  and so I've stockpiled the ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine.
[02:21:20.740 --> 02:21:23.740]  We're talking, I've probably given out hundreds of bottles of each,
[02:21:23.740 --> 02:21:28.740]  and I've got them from you and other great folks, because if you get them from you, it's very inexpensive and high quality.
[02:21:28.740 --> 02:21:34.740]  But everybody should go to DrStellaMD.com, and just like you have a fire extinguisher,
[02:21:35.740 --> 02:21:39.740]  just like you have a firearm in your house, just like you have gas in your car, food in the refrigerator,
[02:21:39.740 --> 02:21:44.740]  everybody needs these things for what's coming, because in the next wave,
[02:21:44.740 --> 02:21:50.740]  we know there's already shortages of all the major medicines, they are going to try to restrict these to control us.
[02:21:50.740 --> 02:21:56.740]  You just saw the beta test, so spend some time on the literature I asked you to bring here.
[02:21:56.740 --> 02:21:59.740]  We can do an overhead shot for TV viewers.
[02:21:59.740 --> 02:22:06.740]  What do people need to go to DrStellaMD.com and stock up on so they know it's in their emergency supply,
[02:22:06.740 --> 02:22:08.740]  so they can help not just themselves, but others?
[02:22:08.740 --> 02:22:11.740]  Yeah, we put together, there are several things that we've done.
[02:22:11.740 --> 02:22:15.740]  We have the medical and the supplements.
[02:22:15.740 --> 02:22:22.740]  We put together, because remember, if something crazy happens, and you can't get your medicine,
[02:22:22.740 --> 02:22:24.740]  maybe you're on high blood pressure medicine.
[02:22:24.740 --> 02:22:26.740]  And you know it's coming, you can feel it, you can see it.
[02:22:26.740 --> 02:22:33.740]  If you cannot get your medicine, we have put together a bunch of doctors that will give you your basic medical prescriptions.
[02:22:33.740 --> 02:22:36.740]  They will give you three months' supply of your medicine and four refills,
[02:22:36.740 --> 02:22:40.740]  which you can work with your pharmacy to get a year's supply of your medicines,
[02:22:40.740 --> 02:22:43.740]  whether it's high blood pressure medicine, diabetes, or whatever you're taking.
[02:22:43.740 --> 02:22:51.740]  The second thing that we did is that we put together what we call five antibiotics you will need in an emergency.
[02:22:51.740 --> 02:22:52.740]  So we work with our doctors.
[02:22:53.740 --> 02:22:58.740]  They will look at you, call, you will go in and get a telehealth appointment.
[02:22:58.740 --> 02:23:01.740]  They will look at your prescriptions, they will look at your drug interactions.
[02:23:01.740 --> 02:23:08.740]  We make sure that it's legit, it is legal, medically, and then they will look at everything that you have,
[02:23:08.740 --> 02:23:10.740]  and then they will decide which antibiotics you need.
[02:23:10.740 --> 02:23:12.740]  This is not for you to use on a daily basis.
[02:23:12.740 --> 02:23:14.740]  So we put five antibiotics.
[02:23:14.740 --> 02:23:18.740]  One, we put amoxicillin and augmentin that will treat upper respiratory tract infections.
[02:23:19.740 --> 02:23:24.740]  One will treat chest infections, one will treat skin infections, UTI, and of course GI infections,
[02:23:24.740 --> 02:23:25.740]  or urinary tract infections.
[02:23:25.740 --> 02:23:28.740]  And people always that aren't doctors call me and they say,
[02:23:28.740 --> 02:23:30.740]  why are you promoting antibiotics for viruses?
[02:23:30.740 --> 02:23:36.740]  But then all the top scientists we have on explain bacteria create the infections and carry the viruses in, right?
[02:23:36.740 --> 02:23:39.740]  Yes, and apart from that, even when you get a viral infection,
[02:23:39.740 --> 02:23:43.740]  there are usually opportunistic bacteria that come in.
[02:23:43.740 --> 02:23:46.740]  For example, if things get crazy, can you get a toothache?
[02:23:46.740 --> 02:23:47.740]  What are you going to do?
[02:23:47.740 --> 02:23:49.740]  The dentist is not available, there's no way.
[02:23:49.740 --> 02:23:56.740]  So what we want to do is, like I said, we look at all the logistics and we look at it legitimately in medicine.
[02:23:56.740 --> 02:24:01.740]  So okay, we can give you five antibiotics you will need in an emergency in your medicine cabinet.
[02:24:01.740 --> 02:24:02.740]  It's not for you to take.
[02:24:02.740 --> 02:24:06.740]  And it will give you instructions on this antibiotic and how to take it if something crazy happens.
[02:24:06.740 --> 02:24:09.740]  The other thing we want to do is COVID complete kit.
[02:24:09.740 --> 02:24:11.740]  COVID complete care kit.
[02:24:12.740 --> 02:24:17.740]  What will give you the hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, Z-Pak, budesonite and a nebulizer.
[02:24:17.740 --> 02:24:19.740]  And we give you that COVID complete kit.
[02:24:19.740 --> 02:24:21.740]  By the way, I got one of the units for you for like nothing.
[02:24:21.740 --> 02:24:25.740]  And then friends of mine in North Carolina got paid 10 times more for it.
[02:24:25.740 --> 02:24:28.740]  They got gouged by one of the big pharmacies.
[02:24:28.740 --> 02:24:32.740]  They paid like $1,000 for a nebulizer when they were all sold out.
[02:24:32.740 --> 02:24:34.740]  Oh, our nebulizers are $55.
[02:24:34.740 --> 02:24:35.740]  And guess what?
[02:24:35.740 --> 02:24:39.740]  You can actually, we did one that you can use if there's no electricity,
[02:24:39.740 --> 02:24:42.740]  you can pluck it to your power bank and be able to use it.
[02:24:42.740 --> 02:24:46.740]  So you can use it if there's no electricity, if the grid goes down.
[02:24:46.740 --> 02:24:48.740]  And I'm sorry I'm interrupting, please continue.
[02:24:48.740 --> 02:24:52.740]  The past year I've just really been working and thinking if things get crazy,
[02:24:52.740 --> 02:24:56.740]  I read Revelation, I'm a minister of the gospel and I know what is coming.
[02:24:56.740 --> 02:25:01.740]  So I'm like people get ready, get food, get everything, get your prescription drugs,
[02:25:01.740 --> 02:25:06.740]  get your COVID pack, get antibiotics you will need in an emergency.
[02:25:06.740 --> 02:25:09.740]  You have to make a doctor's appointment, talk with a doctor,
[02:25:09.740 --> 02:25:12.740]  look at your medicines or look at the interactions of the medicines that you're on
[02:25:12.740 --> 02:25:15.740]  and take care of you to suit what it is that you're doing.
[02:25:15.740 --> 02:25:17.740]  So they go to the website, they call, they have a consultation,
[02:25:17.740 --> 02:25:19.740]  they find out, you get them prepared.
[02:25:19.740 --> 02:25:22.740]  Yes, the second thing that we did, we have something on our website,
[02:25:22.740 --> 02:25:25.740]  the respiratory care kit.
[02:25:25.740 --> 02:25:28.740]  We have a respiratory care kit where you have an oximeter
[02:25:28.740 --> 02:25:30.740]  where you can check your oxygen.
[02:25:30.740 --> 02:25:34.740]  You have the nebulizer, that's the one that I said you can use.
[02:25:34.740 --> 02:25:37.740]  You can pluck it to a USB port and use it.
[02:25:37.740 --> 02:25:39.740]  And then of course you can exercise your lungs
[02:25:39.740 --> 02:25:42.740]  and even to check your temperature, we have the respiratory care kit.
[02:25:42.740 --> 02:25:46.740]  And then we have another kit called a pandemic prep kit
[02:25:46.740 --> 02:25:51.740]  where we put together supplements that can help you to build your immunity
[02:25:51.740 --> 02:25:54.740]  when you're having COVID, to build your immunity on different viruses.
[02:25:54.740 --> 02:25:57.740]  Even when they went crazy about monkey pox,
[02:25:57.740 --> 02:26:01.740]  we did what we call sericinia purpure, I don't know what you know about it.
[02:26:01.740 --> 02:26:08.740]  It's a supplement that was used by Indians in the days of smallpox
[02:26:08.740 --> 02:26:09.740]  and it worked.
[02:26:09.740 --> 02:26:12.740]  It's actually, I take all this information on the NIH website.
[02:26:12.740 --> 02:26:13.740]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:26:13.740 --> 02:26:18.740]  And then we put together another supplement in case we have Ebola
[02:26:18.740 --> 02:26:19.740]  and Marburg and stuff like that.
[02:26:19.740 --> 02:26:22.740]  And we know they're gearing up Marburg, polio, all of it.
[02:26:22.740 --> 02:26:25.740]  And you're just saying, this is real insurance, you better be ready.
[02:26:25.740 --> 02:26:29.740]  Yes, we want to give you stuff that you can use to build your immunity.
[02:26:29.740 --> 02:26:31.740]  I know you have it, I hope you have it.
[02:26:31.740 --> 02:26:36.740]  We also make sure that if we get nuked, you have potassium iodide
[02:26:36.740 --> 02:26:37.740]  to protect your thyroid.
[02:26:37.740 --> 02:26:42.740]  So we're basically trying to make sure that if something crazy happens
[02:26:42.740 --> 02:26:45.740]  and you have to be stuck in your house, you have food, you have water,
[02:26:45.740 --> 02:26:49.740]  you have medicine, you have everything that you need to be stuck in your house.
[02:26:49.740 --> 02:26:51.740]  And it's going to happen.
[02:26:51.740 --> 02:26:53.740]  Right now we're dealing with the calm before the storm
[02:26:53.740 --> 02:26:57.740]  and I'm just screaming at people, be prepared, be ready.
[02:26:57.740 --> 02:26:59.740]  You know about FedNow, they're already working on,
[02:26:59.740 --> 02:27:03.740]  when they start CBDCs and they said you cannot buy or sell without a mark,
[02:27:03.740 --> 02:27:04.740]  what are you going to do?
[02:27:04.740 --> 02:27:10.740]  When they crash all your bank accounts and then they hold all your money,
[02:27:10.740 --> 02:27:11.740]  what are you going to do?
[02:27:11.740 --> 02:27:12.740]  It happened in Nigeria.
[02:27:12.740 --> 02:27:14.740]  You know what's happening in Nigeria?
[02:27:14.740 --> 02:27:16.740]  For those that don't know, they did an India, Nigeria, or the test case
[02:27:16.740 --> 02:27:19.740]  for the central bank digital currencies, cell phones.
[02:27:19.740 --> 02:27:23.740]  In Nigeria, in 2021, the first thing they did in Nigeria is that
[02:27:23.740 --> 02:27:27.740]  they got everybody's phone and said that if you don't go and register your phone,
[02:27:27.740 --> 02:27:28.740]  they'll turn off your phone.
[02:27:28.740 --> 02:27:31.740]  So everybody had to go register their phone and get an N.I. number.
[02:27:31.740 --> 02:27:36.740]  A few months ago, they told Nigerians that they are changing the naira currency,
[02:27:36.740 --> 02:27:39.740]  that election is coming, they don't want people to bribe people
[02:27:39.740 --> 02:27:42.740]  and get fraud and everything, so they're changing the color of their naira.
[02:27:42.740 --> 02:27:47.740]  So people, they swept trillions of naira out of the system
[02:27:47.740 --> 02:27:50.740]  and when they were done, they printed like one billion naira
[02:27:50.740 --> 02:27:53.740]  and everybody in Nigeria right now doesn't have money.
[02:27:53.740 --> 02:27:55.740]  They can't access their money.
[02:27:55.740 --> 02:27:56.740]  So people are busy.
[02:27:56.740 --> 02:27:58.740]  And the good news is Nigeria is fighting back, though.
[02:27:58.740 --> 02:28:02.740]  Yes, even old parents are busy trying to transfer money through the phone.
[02:28:02.740 --> 02:28:05.740]  Alex, they destroyed small businesses, people that are just struggling.
[02:28:05.740 --> 02:28:09.740]  There are people in Nigeria that would spend $20 and buy something
[02:28:09.740 --> 02:28:12.740]  and go sell it for maybe $25 and make a little bit of money.
[02:28:12.740 --> 02:28:18.740]  So if you think the tyranny was bad, they admit as soon as the central bank digital currency goes in,
[02:28:18.740 --> 02:28:21.740]  they did it in India and Nigeria as a test.
[02:28:21.740 --> 02:28:29.740]  Yes, and Nigerians are fighting back, but I don't think the Nigerians truly realize what the battle is.
[02:28:29.740 --> 02:28:30.740]  Do you know what I'm saying?
[02:28:30.740 --> 02:28:34.740]  Like right now, the vice president, they had an election, of course.
[02:28:34.740 --> 02:28:37.740]  The person that won the election, the other one, they just installed
[02:28:37.740 --> 02:28:41.740]  or they just declared somebody else a winner, somebody that is old and, you know...
[02:28:41.740 --> 02:28:45.740]  Hold on, stay there, Doc, because I'm telling you, I can feel the Holy Spirit on you
[02:28:45.740 --> 02:28:46.740]  and I'm not just saying that, folks.
[02:28:46.740 --> 02:28:48.740]  So some of the gifts we have, I can feel the Holy Spirit.
[02:28:48.740 --> 02:28:50.740]  I feel it's so strong, this lady.
[02:28:50.740 --> 02:28:51.740]  Amen.
[02:28:51.740 --> 02:28:52.740]  Oh, yeah, I can feel it. Love you.
[02:28:52.740 --> 02:28:54.740]  We'll be right back. Stay with us, folks.
[02:29:16.740 --> 02:29:20.740]  Don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down.
[02:29:20.740 --> 02:29:22.740]  Alex Jones was right.
[02:29:22.740 --> 02:29:26.740]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[02:29:26.740 --> 02:29:29.740]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[02:29:29.740 --> 02:29:33.740]  Alex Jones called this years ago, years ago.
[02:29:33.740 --> 02:29:37.740]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second.
[02:29:37.740 --> 02:29:40.740]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[02:29:40.740 --> 02:29:42.740]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[02:29:42.740 --> 02:29:45.740]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[02:29:45.740 --> 02:29:50.740]  That's why the globalists hate me is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[02:29:57.740 --> 02:29:59.740]  I've got some good news.
[02:29:59.740 --> 02:30:06.740]  Our high quality supplements really work and we have about an 80% reorder rate with customers.
[02:30:06.740 --> 02:30:08.740]  That's the good news. They're amazing.
[02:30:08.740 --> 02:30:13.740]  The bad news is around 1% or a little less of our actual viewers and listeners
[02:30:13.740 --> 02:30:16.740]  ever go to Infowarsstore.com and ever actually buy the products.
[02:30:16.740 --> 02:30:20.740]  So you're missing out on these products plus it funds the Infowar.
[02:30:20.740 --> 02:30:25.740]  Think of what we've done with just 1% of our massive audience actually buying products.
[02:30:25.740 --> 02:30:30.740]  Think what would happen if those of you on the fence actually went to Infowarsstore.com
[02:30:30.740 --> 02:30:32.740]  and got some of these amazing products.
[02:30:32.740 --> 02:30:38.740]  I would recommend Turmeric 95 for your joints, your bones, inflammation to get one of the biggest effects
[02:30:38.740 --> 02:30:40.740]  so you reorder it and see how great it is.
[02:30:40.740 --> 02:30:46.740]  Also, we've got the super high quality full spectrum CBD oil that's so good for your neurological systems,

[02:32:04.740 --> 02:32:07.740]  So yeah, you say, why doesn't Biden address the disasters in the United States?
[02:32:07.740 --> 02:32:09.740]  He doesn't care.
[02:32:09.740 --> 02:32:10.740]  That's not his job.
[02:32:10.740 --> 02:32:12.740]  He's not the president of the United States.
[02:32:12.740 --> 02:32:15.740]  He's a puppet operating for the globalists.
[02:32:15.740 --> 02:32:20.740]  Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased.
[02:32:20.740 --> 02:32:22.740]  They must be opposed.
[02:32:22.740 --> 02:32:25.740]  Autocrats only understand one word.
[02:32:25.740 --> 02:32:26.740]  No.
[02:32:26.740 --> 02:32:27.740]  No.
[02:32:27.740 --> 02:32:28.740]  No.
[02:32:28.740 --> 02:32:29.740]  Exactly.
[02:32:29.740 --> 02:32:32.740]  And that's why we say no to your vaccines.
[02:32:33.740 --> 02:32:36.740]  We say no to you shutting down our businesses.
[02:32:36.740 --> 02:32:38.740]  We say no to you taking our firearms.
[02:32:38.740 --> 02:32:41.740]  We say no to you censoring our free speech.
[02:32:41.740 --> 02:32:44.740]  We say no to you selling us out to the World Health Organization.
[02:32:44.740 --> 02:32:47.740]  We say no to you getting us into World War III.
[02:32:47.740 --> 02:32:48.740]  You're right.
[02:32:48.740 --> 02:32:52.740]  We stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden, and we say no.
[02:32:52.740 --> 02:32:54.740]  And we say no to your war.
[02:32:54.740 --> 02:33:04.740]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:16.740 --> 02:33:21.740]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:22.740 --> 02:33:29.740]  Again, I'm not bringing up Nigeria because Dr. Stella is an expert on what's happening over there.
[02:33:29.740 --> 02:33:30.740]  I'm bringing up all the time.
[02:33:30.740 --> 02:33:34.740]  China, India, and Nigeria are the model for the central bank digital currency.
[02:33:34.740 --> 02:33:36.740]  Tucker Carlson's covered it.
[02:33:36.740 --> 02:33:38.740]  Nigeria is revolting the hardest.
[02:33:38.740 --> 02:33:41.740]  The Italians, they're bringing it in as a beta in Europe.
[02:33:41.740 --> 02:33:43.740]  They've been fighting back as well.
[02:33:43.740 --> 02:33:46.740]  They're cutting the farmers off in the Netherlands.
[02:33:46.740 --> 02:33:47.740]  They're fighting back hard.
[02:33:47.740 --> 02:33:48.740]  We've been covering that a lot.
[02:33:48.740 --> 02:33:53.740]  So it's Italy, the Netherlands, Nigeria, China, India.
[02:33:53.740 --> 02:33:56.740]  Australia is also a big model.
[02:33:56.740 --> 02:33:59.740]  And Canada, too.
[02:33:59.740 --> 02:34:05.740]  It's a lot of globalist countries, but they are really bringing in the central bank digital currency system in Nigeria.
[02:34:05.740 --> 02:34:10.740]  And the public has been revolting for over a year over it as they saw how horrible it was.
[02:34:10.740 --> 02:34:15.740]  But as you said, you're saying it's a spiritual issue.
[02:34:15.740 --> 02:34:18.740]  And that's really what this is of total control.
[02:34:18.740 --> 02:34:20.740]  Please elaborate on that for us.
[02:34:20.740 --> 02:34:25.740]  I think the people in Nigeria don't think it's probably a political thing going on.
[02:34:25.740 --> 02:34:30.740]  You know, Alex, they have a group of people called the Young Globalist.
[02:34:30.740 --> 02:34:32.740]  They have about 10,000 of them that are trained,
[02:34:32.740 --> 02:34:36.740]  operatives that are sent into all countries to become the leaders in all countries.
[02:34:36.740 --> 02:34:42.740]  So number one, like in Nigeria, the vice president is part of the World Economic Forum.
[02:34:43.740 --> 02:34:50.740]  The minister of petroleum, the minister of telecommunication, and the minister of finance,
[02:34:50.740 --> 02:34:52.740]  they are all part of the World Economic Forum.
[02:34:52.740 --> 02:34:54.740]  And if everybody's listening to this from Nigeria,
[02:34:54.740 --> 02:34:56.740]  just go on the World Economic Forum and Google it.
[02:34:56.740 --> 02:34:57.740]  You'll be able to find it.
[02:34:57.740 --> 02:35:02.740]  So the main people that run the government, money, finance, telecommunication, petroleum,
[02:35:02.740 --> 02:35:04.740]  they are part of the World Economic Forum.
[02:35:04.740 --> 02:35:05.740]  So they are building this stuff in Nigeria.
[02:35:05.740 --> 02:35:08.740]  Nigerians know that they are fighting something crazy.
[02:35:08.740 --> 02:35:11.740]  But I don't know that they understand the death of it.
[02:35:11.740 --> 02:35:19.740]  These demons, they have a timeline of 2025 for all countries to be globalized, to be digitalized.
[02:35:19.740 --> 02:35:20.740]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:35:20.740 --> 02:35:22.740]  So they are using Nigeria right now.
[02:35:22.740 --> 02:35:23.740]  They don't care.
[02:35:23.740 --> 02:35:24.740]  They've got orders from Satan.
[02:35:24.740 --> 02:35:26.740]  Yes, of course they take orders from Satan.
[02:35:26.740 --> 02:35:30.740]  They are not even thinking about the fact that it's hurting people, small businesses,
[02:35:30.740 --> 02:35:32.740]  people that are just struggling,
[02:35:32.740 --> 02:35:36.740]  or mothers that are just struggling to make a little money and get some cassava and go sell.
[02:35:36.740 --> 02:35:39.740]  Now they have to deal with getting a phone and learning to transmit money.
[02:35:39.740 --> 02:35:42.740]  We have people from Europe and America in Nigeria right now.
[02:35:42.740 --> 02:35:47.740]  What they are trying to put together is a system so that people can start being able to transmit money.
[02:35:47.740 --> 02:35:48.740]  And that's the key.
[02:35:48.740 --> 02:35:51.740]  When a phone might be a quarter year of somebody's salary who's a farmer,
[02:35:51.740 --> 02:35:53.740]  they're making them get that as the control system.
[02:35:53.740 --> 02:35:54.740]  Yes, they are making.
[02:35:54.740 --> 02:35:57.740]  Most people might just get a flip phone to communicate with their family.
[02:35:57.740 --> 02:35:59.740]  But right now they all have to get a smartphone.
[02:35:59.740 --> 02:36:02.740]  So Nigeria is fighting back.
[02:36:02.740 --> 02:36:06.740]  I just want people back there to realize that this is a deep battle.
[02:36:06.740 --> 02:36:07.740]  It's a spiritual battle.
[02:36:07.740 --> 02:36:09.740]  These demons want to control everybody.
[02:36:09.740 --> 02:36:14.740]  If you read in the book of Revelation, Revelation 13 from verse 16 to 18 says,
[02:36:14.740 --> 02:36:22.740]  there's going to come a time when all people, men, women, rich, poor, black, white,
[02:36:22.740 --> 02:36:28.740]  all nations are going to come to a time when you cannot buy or sell without using the mark.
[02:36:28.740 --> 02:36:29.740]  And you know this.
[02:36:29.740 --> 02:36:30.740]  And that's the key.
[02:36:30.740 --> 02:36:32.740]  Everybody thinks they're going to be part of the system.
[02:36:32.740 --> 02:36:33.740]  No, we're all under attack.
[02:36:33.740 --> 02:36:34.740]  We're all under attack.
[02:36:34.740 --> 02:36:35.740]  This is a worldwide battle.
[02:36:36.740 --> 02:36:40.740]  If you speak to Nigerians, sometimes they think, okay, Nigerians are fighting this by themselves.
[02:36:40.740 --> 02:36:41.740]  Cameroonians are fighting it.
[02:36:41.740 --> 02:36:42.740]  There's been war in Cameroon.
[02:36:42.740 --> 02:36:43.740]  I'm originally from Cameroon.
[02:36:43.740 --> 02:36:45.740]  There's been war in Cameroon for years right now.
[02:36:45.740 --> 02:36:51.740]  They have a president that has been in power since I was a teenager, since I was like 12.
[02:36:51.740 --> 02:36:52.740]  Our president has been in power.
[02:36:52.740 --> 02:36:55.740]  And so that one does not even think.
[02:36:55.740 --> 02:36:56.740]  Then they go to Nigeria.
[02:36:56.740 --> 02:36:59.740]  They pick this terrible guy that can barely reason.
[02:36:59.740 --> 02:37:02.740]  And then of course we have our own one here in the White House.
[02:37:02.740 --> 02:37:04.740]  So they want to bring all these people that can't think,
[02:37:04.740 --> 02:37:08.740]  can't reason, don't have any ability to actually run the government
[02:37:08.740 --> 02:37:11.740]  while the shadowy government is running them behind.
[02:37:11.740 --> 02:37:14.740]  Of course, Nigeria is the greatest country in Africa.
[02:37:14.740 --> 02:37:16.740]  Nigeria is the most populated country in Africa.
[02:37:16.740 --> 02:37:20.740]  If they take down Nigeria, they can start now pushing through other countries.
[02:37:20.740 --> 02:37:23.740]  But I love the fact that Nigerians are fighting back.
[02:37:23.740 --> 02:37:24.740]  They did not get Africa.
[02:37:24.740 --> 02:37:30.740]  They did not get them through COVID because of course, you know, we're prayerful and of course anti-malaria.
[02:37:30.740 --> 02:37:31.740]  I call it Sunday.
[02:37:31.740 --> 02:37:33.740]  Well, plus the Africans have been through it.
[02:37:33.740 --> 02:37:34.740]  They don't trust the UN, do they?
[02:37:34.740 --> 02:37:35.740]  No, so they should stop.
[02:37:35.740 --> 02:37:37.740]  Nigerians should not stop fighting.
[02:37:37.740 --> 02:37:38.740]  Should not stop.
[02:37:38.740 --> 02:37:40.740]  Go back and look at your leaders.
[02:37:40.740 --> 02:37:42.740]  This is one of the things that every country needs to do.
[02:37:42.740 --> 02:37:44.740]  Everybody needs to go online.
[02:37:44.740 --> 02:37:45.740]  Go on World Economic Forum.
[02:37:45.740 --> 02:37:46.740]  Pull their distance.
[02:37:46.740 --> 02:37:47.740]  Look at the Young Globalist.
[02:37:47.740 --> 02:37:48.740]  There's a whole list of them.
[02:37:48.740 --> 02:37:49.740]  It's on their website.
[02:37:49.740 --> 02:37:52.740]  Pull it and then make sure that you don't vote this Young Globalist in.
[02:37:52.740 --> 02:37:54.740]  Don't give them a place of power.
[02:37:54.740 --> 02:37:56.740]  Don't make them principles in your schools.
[02:37:56.740 --> 02:37:57.740]  Exactly.
[02:37:57.740 --> 02:37:58.740]  Just examine their pedigree.
[02:37:58.740 --> 02:38:01.740]  Examine who they are because they are there to represent Klaus Schwab
[02:38:01.740 --> 02:38:05.740]  and the demons that are over him and Yuval Noah and stuff.
[02:38:05.740 --> 02:38:07.740]  They are there to represent it.
[02:38:07.740 --> 02:38:10.740]  Right now, if you listen to Yuval Noah, Klaus Schwab,
[02:38:10.740 --> 02:38:13.740]  they are all sounding as if they've already won humanity.
[02:38:13.740 --> 02:38:17.740]  But I want everybody to understand there will be a great reset.
[02:38:17.740 --> 02:38:19.740]  They are planning Agenda 3030.
[02:38:19.740 --> 02:38:22.740]  By Agenda 3030, we should all own nothing and be happy.
[02:38:22.740 --> 02:38:25.740]  But we're fighting back and humanity needs to continue fighting.
[02:38:25.740 --> 02:38:29.740]  They didn't realize that we were going to stand up and fight this much.
[02:38:29.740 --> 02:38:31.740]  But there will be a great reset.
[02:38:31.740 --> 02:38:33.740]  If you read the book of Revelation to the end,
[02:38:33.740 --> 02:38:36.740]  you will realize that the great reset is going to be done by God.
[02:38:36.740 --> 02:38:38.740]  So I don't want people to be fearful.
[02:38:38.740 --> 02:38:42.740]  I don't want people to think that, oh, everything is going to come down.
[02:38:42.740 --> 02:38:43.740]  Exactly.
[02:38:43.740 --> 02:38:46.740]  Satan thinks he's winning in the third quarter, but he loses in the end.
[02:38:46.740 --> 02:38:47.740]  Yes, he loses.
[02:38:47.740 --> 02:38:49.740]  And you can't deny 2,000 years ago,
[02:38:49.740 --> 02:38:53.740]  John on the Isle of Patmos has a vision with an angel and it's all happening.
[02:38:53.740 --> 02:38:54.740]  It's happening.
[02:38:54.740 --> 02:38:56.740]  It's all happening.
[02:38:56.740 --> 02:39:00.740]  If you read in Daniel, because we have a Twitter space that we do.
[02:39:00.740 --> 02:39:04.740]  I don't trust Twitter, but right now we use it for as much as we use it.
[02:39:04.740 --> 02:39:05.740]  Do you understand what I'm saying?
[02:39:05.740 --> 02:39:09.740]  We have a Twitter space we do reading the book of Daniel and Revelation on Twitter.
[02:39:09.740 --> 02:39:11.740]  You can join me on that.
[02:39:11.740 --> 02:39:14.740]  My grandfather always told me, and he was a big theologian,
[02:39:14.740 --> 02:39:18.740]  is Daniel and then Old Testament, New Testament, it happens.
[02:39:18.740 --> 02:39:19.740]  It's all one book.
[02:39:19.740 --> 02:39:20.740]  It's all one book.
[02:39:20.740 --> 02:39:25.740]  If you look at in the book of Daniel, Daniel chapter 2, like verse 42, 41 to 43,
[02:39:25.740 --> 02:39:28.740]  it talks about a time is going to come where there will be a mingling of seed,
[02:39:28.740 --> 02:39:32.740]  where that they will mingle themselves with the seed of man.
[02:39:32.740 --> 02:39:36.740]  So I try to let human beings know that we're fighting Satan.
[02:39:36.740 --> 02:39:38.740]  We're fighting people that are not human.
[02:39:38.740 --> 02:39:40.740]  And whenever I say that, I'm like, oh, Dr. Sarah,
[02:39:40.740 --> 02:39:41.740]  why would you say something so crazy?
[02:39:41.740 --> 02:39:43.740]  You all know I'm saying it,
[02:39:43.740 --> 02:39:46.740]  that they are producing bodies that are not human,
[02:39:46.740 --> 02:39:48.740]  that are inert and they're going to take over the world.
[02:39:48.740 --> 02:39:50.740]  They've been making clones a long time.
[02:39:50.740 --> 02:39:51.740]  They've been making clones for a long time.
[02:39:51.740 --> 02:39:54.740]  If you read in Revelation chapter 13, verse 14 and 15,
[02:39:54.740 --> 02:39:57.740]  it said the devil would deceive the people in the world
[02:39:57.740 --> 02:40:00.740]  and they will be able to make images onto the devil.
[02:40:00.740 --> 02:40:04.740]  Well, I think Hitler was able to clone rabbits in 44 by the 70s.
[02:40:04.740 --> 02:40:06.740]  I covered it when I was on air in the 90s.
[02:40:06.740 --> 02:40:08.740]  It was in mainline medical literature
[02:40:08.740 --> 02:40:10.740]  that they'd already been cloning humanoids
[02:40:10.740 --> 02:40:12.740]  that are a whole bunch of splice genes.
[02:40:12.740 --> 02:40:13.740]  They aren't a person.
[02:40:13.740 --> 02:40:15.740]  Then they implant them in women or they use cows
[02:40:15.740 --> 02:40:17.740]  and they're rolling them out, giving them identities,
[02:40:17.740 --> 02:40:18.740]  and they're everywhere.
[02:40:18.740 --> 02:40:20.740]  So right now...
[02:40:20.740 --> 02:40:21.740]  So they don't have souls, do they?
[02:40:21.740 --> 02:40:22.740]  No, they don't have souls.
[02:40:22.740 --> 02:40:23.740]  So what are they?
[02:40:23.740 --> 02:40:24.740]  They're like a replicant, right?
[02:40:24.740 --> 02:40:25.740]  Like Blade Runner.
[02:40:25.740 --> 02:40:27.740]  Yes, they are clones.
[02:40:27.740 --> 02:40:28.740]  They are Nephilims.
[02:40:28.740 --> 02:40:30.740]  In the book of Genesis, the Nephilims,
[02:40:30.740 --> 02:40:33.740]  demons came and slept with women and they produced these hybrids.
[02:40:33.740 --> 02:40:35.740]  But right now they are not doing that.
[02:40:35.740 --> 02:40:37.740]  They are just fixing them up in the lab.
[02:40:37.740 --> 02:40:39.740]  You know, if you read in Revelation 13,
[02:40:39.740 --> 02:40:42.740]  the Bible says in Revelation 13, 14 and 15,
[02:40:42.740 --> 02:40:45.740]  it said the devil would deceive the people of the world
[02:40:45.740 --> 02:40:48.740]  and they will produce images onto the devil
[02:40:48.740 --> 02:40:50.740]  and the devil would give them life,
[02:40:50.740 --> 02:40:52.740]  give breath to these images.
[02:40:52.740 --> 02:40:53.740]  These images will be able to...
[02:40:53.740 --> 02:40:54.740]  Which is a digital image.
[02:40:54.740 --> 02:40:55.740]  Yes.
[02:40:55.740 --> 02:40:56.740]  It's all super advanced.
[02:40:56.740 --> 02:40:57.740]  Yes.
[02:40:57.740 --> 02:40:59.740]  So these AIs, they are all around us.
[02:40:59.740 --> 02:41:02.740]  The Lord showed me this in 2015 that they were all around us.
[02:41:02.740 --> 02:41:04.740]  Alex, I'm a prayer warrior.
[02:41:04.740 --> 02:41:07.740]  Every now and then I blow them up in the Spirit.
[02:41:07.740 --> 02:41:10.740]  I want to tell Christians, remember, these are demons.
[02:41:10.740 --> 02:41:13.740]  Don't worry about them at the mention of the name of Jesus.
[02:41:13.740 --> 02:41:14.740]  Every knee bows.
[02:41:14.740 --> 02:41:16.740]  So sometimes I will be attacked in the Spirit
[02:41:16.740 --> 02:41:19.740]  and I will come out and I will call the fire of the Holy Ghost
[02:41:19.740 --> 02:41:20.740]  and the blood of Jesus.
[02:41:20.740 --> 02:41:21.740]  I command you to blow up
[02:41:21.740 --> 02:41:22.740]  and they will blow up.
[02:41:22.740 --> 02:41:25.740]  So I want people to realize you can fight these powers
[02:41:25.740 --> 02:41:26.740]  by the name of Jesus.
[02:41:26.740 --> 02:41:27.740]  Don't be scared.
[02:41:27.740 --> 02:41:30.740]  If you're in a situation that you feel comfortable,
[02:41:30.740 --> 02:41:32.740]  just call on the name of Jesus
[02:41:32.740 --> 02:41:35.740]  and these demons will bow because that is what happens.
[02:41:35.740 --> 02:41:37.740]  But what you're saying is so true
[02:41:37.740 --> 02:41:40.740]  because I remember reading like in MIT Quarterly
[02:41:40.740 --> 02:41:42.740]  30 years ago when I was first about to go on air
[02:41:42.740 --> 02:41:44.740]  that they'd made human animal clones
[02:41:44.740 --> 02:41:46.740]  and like made babies out of five adults
[02:41:46.740 --> 02:41:48.740]  and they weren't really human.
[02:41:48.740 --> 02:41:49.740]  What were they?
[02:41:49.740 --> 02:41:50.740]  But don't worry.
[02:41:50.740 --> 02:41:51.740]  I got rid of them in the test tube
[02:41:51.740 --> 02:41:52.740]  and then I talked to people involved in the government.
[02:41:52.740 --> 02:41:54.740]  They said, no, they have given them identities.
[02:41:54.740 --> 02:41:57.740]  They've rolled them out, but they're missing something
[02:41:57.740 --> 02:42:00.740]  and there's literally replicants like the movie Blade Runner.
[02:42:00.740 --> 02:42:03.740]  By the time that movie came out in 1984,
[02:42:03.740 --> 02:42:05.740]  there were already real replicants.
[02:42:05.740 --> 02:42:09.740]  Yes, there's a movie called Sixth Day.
[02:42:09.740 --> 02:42:10.740]  Sixth Day by Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[02:42:10.740 --> 02:42:12.740]  When he goes out by 10, he comes,
[02:42:12.740 --> 02:42:14.740]  they've cloned him and somebody else is in his house.
[02:42:14.740 --> 02:42:18.740]  People have to recognize, I mean, they can clone anybody.
[02:42:19.740 --> 02:42:21.740]  They actually have bodies that they have
[02:42:21.740 --> 02:42:22.740]  that when they clone them,
[02:42:22.740 --> 02:42:24.740]  remember Elon Musk said something,
[02:42:24.740 --> 02:42:25.740]  that with the right sequencing,
[02:42:25.740 --> 02:42:28.740]  they can turn anybody into a freaking butterfly.
[02:42:28.740 --> 02:42:31.740]  So they can actually clone bodies
[02:42:31.740 --> 02:42:33.740]  and then just modify it and splice it
[02:42:33.740 --> 02:42:36.740]  and change their look and then they knock the person out.
[02:42:36.740 --> 02:42:39.740]  But because it's not a genetic one of humans under God,
[02:42:39.740 --> 02:42:40.740]  it doesn't get a soul.
[02:42:40.740 --> 02:42:41.740]  They don't have a soul.
[02:42:41.740 --> 02:42:42.740]  And because they don't have a soul,
[02:42:42.740 --> 02:42:44.740]  they do the most evil things.
[02:42:44.740 --> 02:42:45.740]  Because they don't have a soul,
[02:42:45.740 --> 02:42:46.740]  they don't have a soul.
[02:42:46.740 --> 02:42:49.740]  They don't mind going to school.
[02:42:49.740 --> 02:42:51.740]  So they're genetically engineered psychopaths.
[02:42:51.740 --> 02:42:53.740]  They're genetically engineered psychopaths.
[02:42:53.740 --> 02:42:54.740]  Hold on right there.
[02:42:54.740 --> 02:42:55.740]  Wow, this is powerful.
[02:42:57.740 --> 02:42:59.740]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[02:42:59.740 --> 02:43:01.740]  we have a new toothpaste that my dad,
[02:43:01.740 --> 02:43:04.740]  a retired dentist and oral surgeon, developed.
[02:43:04.740 --> 02:43:06.740]  Dr. Jones Natural's Tumor Toothpaste
[02:43:06.740 --> 02:43:08.740]  that just came into stock.
[02:43:08.740 --> 02:43:09.740]  And I got to tell you,
[02:43:09.740 --> 02:43:11.740]  I got samples of this months ago and it is amazing.
[02:43:11.740 --> 02:43:13.740]  The way it makes your gums feel,
[02:43:13.740 --> 02:43:15.740]  what it does to your mouth, is insane.
[02:43:15.740 --> 02:43:18.740]  We know turmeric is an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory
[02:43:18.740 --> 02:43:20.740]  and does such great things for the body.
[02:43:20.740 --> 02:43:22.740]  Then you add that with tea tree oil
[02:43:22.740 --> 02:43:23.740]  and a bunch of other essential oils.
[02:43:23.740 --> 02:43:25.740]  It is just dynamite.
[02:43:25.740 --> 02:43:29.740]  It is so good to detox and attack inflammation in your mouth.
[02:43:29.740 --> 02:43:32.740]  I want to challenge everybody to try the new toothpaste
[02:43:32.740 --> 02:43:33.740]  at ipfullwarestore.com.
[02:43:33.740 --> 02:43:36.740]  Dr. Jones Natural's Tumor Toothpaste.

[02:44:13.740 --> 02:44:16.740]  Now I'm addicted to helping my fellow Americans.
[02:44:16.740 --> 02:44:18.740]  I'm addicted to spreading the truth.
[02:44:18.740 --> 02:44:20.740]  And again, you know, I have info wars to thank for that.
[02:44:20.740 --> 02:44:21.740]  Looking back on the day,
[02:44:21.740 --> 02:44:24.740]  I was able to ask president Donald Trump two questions.
[02:44:24.740 --> 02:44:26.740]  I was so grateful because, you know,
[02:44:26.740 --> 02:44:29.740]  I truly was classically trained under Alex Jones
[02:44:29.740 --> 02:44:30.740]  and under the info wars team.
[02:44:30.740 --> 02:44:34.740]  I really do credit that as to why I'm able to, you know,
[02:44:34.740 --> 02:44:37.740]  get these types of clips because Alex's whole mentality was,
[02:44:37.740 --> 02:44:39.740]  you know, go where the story is,
[02:44:39.740 --> 02:44:41.740]  go where the mainstream media refuses to.
[02:44:41.740 --> 02:44:43.740]  So it's not that I'm addicted to the insanity.
[02:44:43.740 --> 02:44:45.740]  I'm just addicted to telling the truth
[02:44:45.740 --> 02:44:47.740]  and helping the American people.
[02:44:47.740 --> 02:44:49.740]  And I really do credit Alex for, you know,
[02:44:49.740 --> 02:44:52.740]  living and spilling that within me early on in my career.
[02:45:12.740 --> 02:45:14.740]  Talking to the viewers and listeners that have tuned in
[02:45:14.740 --> 02:45:17.740]  many of you for years and never gone to info war store.com.
[02:45:17.740 --> 02:45:21.740]  We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you
[02:45:21.740 --> 02:45:23.740]  never actually go to info war store.com
[02:45:23.740 --> 02:45:25.740]  and never experienced these great products
[02:45:25.740 --> 02:45:26.740]  and never found the operation.
[02:45:26.740 --> 02:45:28.740]  Sure. You share a link, you share an article,
[02:45:28.740 --> 02:45:29.740]  you tell folks about the show.
[02:45:29.740 --> 02:45:32.740]  That's great. And I thank you, but we need funds to operate.

[02:45:43.740 --> 02:45:44.740]  They keep us on air.
[02:45:44.740 --> 02:45:45.740]  Plus you're missing out on having these products.
[02:45:45.740 --> 02:45:48.740]  So get off the bench, get in the game, step to the plate
[02:45:48.740 --> 02:45:51.740]  and go to info war store.com right now

[02:45:53.740 --> 02:45:54.740]  at info war store.com.
[02:46:10.740 --> 02:46:11.740]  for a year or two.
[02:46:11.740 --> 02:46:13.740]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones
[02:46:13.740 --> 02:46:15.740]  or those guys have been awake for like decades.
[02:46:17.740 --> 02:46:20.740]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[02:46:20.740 --> 02:46:21.740]  This is reality.
[02:46:21.740 --> 02:46:23.740]  It just came true.
[02:46:23.740 --> 02:46:25.740]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[02:46:25.740 --> 02:46:27.740]  The revolution of peaceful information is coming.
[02:46:27.740 --> 02:46:28.740]  And when it comes time,
[02:46:28.740 --> 02:46:30.740]  you people are going to be brought to punishment.
[02:46:30.740 --> 02:46:31.740]  You're lying to the public.
[02:46:31.740 --> 02:46:32.740]  It's disgusting.
[02:46:32.740 --> 02:46:36.740]  The media continues to misrepresent what I've said.
[02:46:36.740 --> 02:46:39.740]  He may be America's best known conspiracy theorist.
[02:46:39.740 --> 02:46:43.740]  Alex Jones has the largest audience in the country
[02:46:43.740 --> 02:46:45.740]  bigger than any of the networks,
[02:46:45.740 --> 02:46:47.740]  the biggest megaphone in the country.
[02:46:47.740 --> 02:46:49.740]  We're going to get fired up about the real thing,
[02:46:49.740 --> 02:46:51.740]  the things that matter.
[02:46:55.740 --> 02:46:57.740]  Burn in hell, New World Order.
[02:46:59.740 --> 02:47:03.740]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[02:47:03.740 --> 02:47:05.740]  it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:09.740 --> 02:47:17.740]  Dr. Stella Emanuel of drstellamd.com is our guest in studio.
[02:47:17.740 --> 02:47:20.740]  We have another special guest coming in next hour.
[02:47:20.740 --> 02:47:22.740]  We'll take a little bit of their time.
[02:47:22.740 --> 02:47:24.740]  We're going to extend into the next hour.
[02:47:24.740 --> 02:47:27.740]  But, doc, I remember, like I said,
[02:47:27.740 --> 02:47:30.740]  reading in mainline literature,
[02:47:30.740 --> 02:47:33.740]  they had human clones in the 70s.
[02:47:33.740 --> 02:47:35.740]  And then now you see the headlines.
[02:47:35.740 --> 02:47:36.740]  Oh, it's liberal.
[02:47:36.740 --> 02:47:38.740]  Five gay men can have a child together.
[02:47:38.740 --> 02:47:40.740]  That's five men together.
[02:47:40.740 --> 02:47:42.740]  Well, that's not a sperm and an egg.
[02:47:42.740 --> 02:47:44.740]  That's not a zygote.
[02:47:44.740 --> 02:47:46.740]  That's a new thing that looks like a person.
[02:47:46.740 --> 02:47:48.740]  And they're like, oh, well, don't be mean.
[02:47:48.740 --> 02:47:49.740]  Be liberal.
[02:47:49.740 --> 02:47:51.740]  But really, they've just set the precedent
[02:47:51.740 --> 02:47:53.740]  to create a new creature.
[02:47:53.740 --> 02:47:56.740]  They're just using homosexual men as the pretext
[02:47:56.740 --> 02:47:58.740]  of, like, why would men want to have a baby together?
[02:47:58.740 --> 02:48:00.740]  It's not even a baby.
[02:48:00.740 --> 02:48:02.740]  A cyborg.
[02:48:02.740 --> 02:48:04.740]  We're living in the future.
[02:48:04.740 --> 02:48:05.740]  We're living in this.
[02:48:05.740 --> 02:48:07.740]  But it's just not been revealed yet
[02:48:07.740 --> 02:48:08.740]  to the public.
[02:48:08.740 --> 02:48:09.740]  Please continue.
[02:48:09.740 --> 02:48:12.740]  You know, in 2011, we did a 100 Day Prayer program.
[02:48:12.740 --> 02:48:14.740]  At the end of the 100 Day Prayer,
[02:48:14.740 --> 02:48:15.740]  I had a dream.
[02:48:15.740 --> 02:48:17.740]  God speaks to me in prophetic dreams.
[02:48:17.740 --> 02:48:19.740]  I had a dream and I had these people come into my room
[02:48:19.740 --> 02:48:20.740]  and they were fighting.
[02:48:20.740 --> 02:48:22.740]  They came into my compound.
[02:48:22.740 --> 02:48:24.740]  And I was fighting and beating them up.
[02:48:24.740 --> 02:48:26.740]  And at the same stop, you can't kill us.
[02:48:26.740 --> 02:48:28.740]  We're genetically modified human beings.
[02:48:28.740 --> 02:48:30.740]  There are a lot of us everywhere.
[02:48:30.740 --> 02:48:31.740]  It is not our time.
[02:48:31.740 --> 02:48:33.740]  When it's our time, we would manifest.
[02:48:33.740 --> 02:48:36.740]  So, and then a few years, a year later,
[02:48:36.740 --> 02:48:37.740]  I had another dream.
[02:48:37.740 --> 02:48:38.740]  I saw people walking around.
[02:48:38.740 --> 02:48:39.740]  Some were humans.
[02:48:39.740 --> 02:48:40.740]  Some were non-humans.
[02:48:40.740 --> 02:48:42.740]  The non-humans did not recognize that they were working
[02:48:42.740 --> 02:48:43.740]  with people that were not humans.
[02:48:43.740 --> 02:48:45.740]  They were swimming in the swimming pool
[02:48:45.740 --> 02:48:46.740]  with, you know, mermaids.
[02:48:46.740 --> 02:48:48.740]  And they didn't recognize it, but I could see them.
[02:48:48.740 --> 02:48:51.740]  And since I had that dream, I've traveled all over the world.
[02:48:51.740 --> 02:48:54.740]  I've discerned these people, these creatures everywhere.
[02:48:54.740 --> 02:48:58.740]  So if you see some kind of great evil going on in our land.
[02:48:58.740 --> 02:48:59.740]  I'm going to fix your piece.
[02:48:59.740 --> 02:49:00.740]  Keep talking.
[02:49:00.740 --> 02:49:03.740]  Yes, if you see, like, a great evil going on in our land
[02:49:03.740 --> 02:49:04.740]  where they are trying to, you know,
[02:49:04.740 --> 02:49:09.740]  maybe they are trying to abort babies at birth,
[02:49:09.740 --> 02:49:11.740]  or they are trying to take our three-year-olds
[02:49:11.740 --> 02:49:14.740]  and show them drag queens so that by the time they are 7-8,
[02:49:14.740 --> 02:49:16.740]  they have been, you know, indoctrinated
[02:49:16.740 --> 02:49:18.740]  and now they are possessed by this demon.
[02:49:18.740 --> 02:49:20.740]  If you see all this evil going on,
[02:49:20.740 --> 02:49:22.740]  killing people and not caring,
[02:49:22.740 --> 02:49:25.740]  remember that there are people among us that are not human.
[02:49:25.740 --> 02:49:27.740]  And by the way, when we talk about possessed,
[02:49:27.740 --> 02:49:29.740]  it's now science.
[02:49:29.740 --> 02:49:30.740]  It's a wavelength.
[02:49:30.740 --> 02:49:31.740]  It's an energy.
[02:49:31.740 --> 02:49:33.740]  Like, you go to a football pep rally or a rock concert,
[02:49:33.740 --> 02:49:34.740]  you feel the energy.
[02:49:34.740 --> 02:49:35.740]  You're a church.
[02:49:35.740 --> 02:49:36.740]  You feel a different energy.
[02:49:36.740 --> 02:49:38.740]  They're literally putting children in this energy.
[02:49:38.740 --> 02:49:39.740]  Yes.
[02:49:39.740 --> 02:49:42.740]  You see, everything in life is spiritual, Alex.
[02:49:42.740 --> 02:49:43.740]  Everything is spiritual.
[02:49:43.740 --> 02:49:44.740]  So people don't realize,
[02:49:44.740 --> 02:49:46.740]  the people that live their lives like,
[02:49:46.740 --> 02:49:47.740]  oh, this is all there is to life,
[02:49:47.740 --> 02:49:49.740]  you're really very mistaken.
[02:49:49.740 --> 02:49:51.740]  It's either evil or good.
[02:49:51.740 --> 02:49:53.740]  So you're either going to serve God or the devil.
[02:49:53.740 --> 02:49:56.740]  So you've got to point your spiritual antenna at something.
[02:49:56.740 --> 02:49:57.740]  Yes.
[02:49:57.740 --> 02:49:58.740]  You've got to decide.
[02:49:58.740 --> 02:49:59.740]  Human beings are not independent.
[02:49:59.740 --> 02:50:01.740]  We are coming to a time when people are going to decide
[02:50:01.740 --> 02:50:03.740]  whether they want God or the devil.
[02:50:03.740 --> 02:50:04.740]  You can't, well, I don't care.
[02:50:04.740 --> 02:50:05.740]  I don't believe.
[02:50:05.740 --> 02:50:06.740]  You, the devil.
[02:50:06.740 --> 02:50:07.740]  You will believe.
[02:50:07.740 --> 02:50:08.740]  Yes.
[02:50:08.740 --> 02:50:09.740]  The devil will get you.
[02:50:09.740 --> 02:50:11.740]  So what is happening right now is that there are people
[02:50:11.740 --> 02:50:13.740]  that, they are creatures.
[02:50:13.740 --> 02:50:14.740]  In Genesis chapter six,
[02:50:14.740 --> 02:50:17.740]  the Nephilims look like thirty-four giants.
[02:50:17.740 --> 02:50:18.740]  You could see them and know.
[02:50:18.740 --> 02:50:20.740]  But right now they didn't have to go through all that.
[02:50:20.740 --> 02:50:23.740]  The people, the Nephilims in our time look like you and I.
[02:50:23.740 --> 02:50:25.740]  The Bible says in the book of Matthew
[02:50:25.740 --> 02:50:28.740]  that in the last days is going to be like in the days of Noah
[02:50:28.740 --> 02:50:31.740]  where people will be marrying and giving to married
[02:50:31.740 --> 02:50:32.740]  or be corruption.
[02:50:32.740 --> 02:50:33.740]  You understand what I'm saying?
[02:50:33.740 --> 02:50:36.740]  So we are in that time and the church need to wake up
[02:50:36.740 --> 02:50:38.740]  because it is a church that understands this
[02:50:38.740 --> 02:50:39.740]  and can fight it.
[02:50:39.740 --> 02:50:42.740]  But most of our big churches have been captured by,
[02:50:42.740 --> 02:50:45.740]  they've been captured and they are just dancing and singing.
[02:50:45.740 --> 02:50:46.740]  Well, I'm just going to say this.
[02:50:46.740 --> 02:50:48.740]  I've been in D.C. a lot
[02:50:48.740 --> 02:50:52.740]  and the first time I ever saw one of these things,
[02:50:52.740 --> 02:50:55.740]  I was walking down the street and I'll admit,
[02:50:55.740 --> 02:50:56.740]  I don't get scared of people,
[02:50:56.740 --> 02:50:58.740]  but I had this, my heart like pounded
[02:50:58.740 --> 02:51:02.740]  and I saw this big white man who looked like he was like
[02:51:02.740 --> 02:51:04.740]  almost seven feet tall.
[02:51:04.740 --> 02:51:07.740]  He had like pointed ears, bald head and he looked at me
[02:51:07.740 --> 02:51:09.740]  and I was like, that's not a human.
[02:51:09.740 --> 02:51:11.740]  He looked like a demon
[02:51:11.740 --> 02:51:14.740]  and then he got in like a fancy limousine and drove off
[02:51:14.740 --> 02:51:16.740]  and my crew was like, are you okay?
[02:51:16.740 --> 02:51:18.740]  And I literally, when I saw the guy like twenty feet away,
[02:51:18.740 --> 02:51:21.740]  I saw him and I'm not just, the book just happened
[02:51:21.740 --> 02:51:22.740]  and it's only been in D.C.
[02:51:22.740 --> 02:51:25.740]  I've seen it a few times where like you see people
[02:51:25.740 --> 02:51:28.740]  and you know instantly that's not a person.
[02:51:28.740 --> 02:51:32.740]  Your gut goes, whoa, that is not, that is bad.
[02:51:32.740 --> 02:51:34.740]  Oh, if I saw them, I would rebuke them.
[02:51:34.740 --> 02:51:37.740]  I would release Holy Ghost fire and bind them.
[02:51:37.740 --> 02:51:39.740]  You know, I would not just let them walk past.
[02:51:39.740 --> 02:51:41.740]  I'm like, hey, come here, you human,
[02:51:41.740 --> 02:51:42.740]  the fire of the Holy Ghost.
[02:51:42.740 --> 02:51:44.740]  Well, I'm just being honest because I didn't expect it.
[02:51:44.740 --> 02:51:45.740]  But I'm a warrior, so it's different.
[02:51:45.740 --> 02:51:46.740]  I'm a spiritual sniper.
[02:51:46.740 --> 02:51:48.740]  Well, I'm just saying I didn't expect it
[02:51:48.740 --> 02:51:50.740]  because I've seen people in D.C.
[02:51:50.740 --> 02:51:52.740]  that you instantly, as a person, you picked something
[02:51:52.740 --> 02:51:54.740]  and you're going to be like, whoa, what the hell is that?
[02:51:54.740 --> 02:51:55.740]  What the hell is that?
[02:51:55.740 --> 02:51:56.740]  That's not normal.
[02:51:56.740 --> 02:51:57.740]  That's not human, yes.
[02:51:57.740 --> 02:52:01.740]  And the issue is this demons around and what they do,
[02:52:01.740 --> 02:52:04.740]  they kind of program the minds of people.
[02:52:04.740 --> 02:52:06.740]  The Bible says in 2 Corinthians 4,
[02:52:06.740 --> 02:52:08.740]  that the devil, that's the God of this world,
[02:52:08.740 --> 02:52:09.740]  has taken over people's minds.
[02:52:09.740 --> 02:52:11.740]  So they program the minds of people.
[02:52:11.740 --> 02:52:13.740]  So people are like in this zoomed out world,
[02:52:13.740 --> 02:52:15.740]  they don't believe anything bad is happening
[02:52:15.740 --> 02:52:17.740]  and they're just sitting down and hoping all will be well.
[02:52:17.740 --> 02:52:20.740]  If they say go left, they go left, go right, they go right.
[02:52:20.740 --> 02:52:21.740]  But people are waking up.
[02:52:21.740 --> 02:52:23.740]  People are waking up to something crazy is going on.
[02:52:23.740 --> 02:52:26.740]  You should wake up to not just something crazy is going on,
[02:52:26.740 --> 02:52:28.740]  you should wake up on this as demonic.
[02:52:28.740 --> 02:52:32.740]  So do you think I saw a clone or what do you think I saw?
[02:52:32.740 --> 02:52:34.740]  Probably one of them Nephilims.
[02:52:34.740 --> 02:52:35.740]  Probably one of them.
[02:52:35.740 --> 02:52:37.740]  I see them around sometimes.
[02:52:37.740 --> 02:52:40.740]  But I'm like I'm a warrior, I release fire.
[02:52:40.740 --> 02:52:45.740]  Alex, I would say it goes fire.
[02:52:45.740 --> 02:52:48.740]  If Satan had his way, what would the earth look like?
[02:52:48.740 --> 02:52:51.740]  What he's trying to do right now is to have his way.
[02:52:51.740 --> 02:52:54.740]  What he wants to do is corrupt all humanity
[02:52:54.740 --> 02:52:57.740]  so that if we can all gather together and say we don't want God,
[02:52:57.740 --> 02:52:58.740]  then he can keep this world.
[02:52:58.740 --> 02:53:01.740]  But Satan knows the end of the battle.
[02:53:01.740 --> 02:53:05.740]  You know, right now, when they get crazy and said
[02:53:05.740 --> 02:53:07.740]  they're not going to make sure that you can buy or sell
[02:53:07.740 --> 02:53:11.740]  and push us to the corner, God will rapture the church out.
[02:53:11.740 --> 02:53:13.740]  But God will prepare the church and bring revival
[02:53:13.740 --> 02:53:15.740]  before he raptures the church out.
[02:53:15.740 --> 02:53:18.740]  When the church is raptured out, Satan and his cohorts,
[02:53:18.740 --> 02:53:20.740]  God will deal with them.
[02:53:20.740 --> 02:53:22.740]  The wrath of God is going to come upon them,
[02:53:22.740 --> 02:53:25.740]  and they know that this is what is going to happen.
[02:53:25.740 --> 02:53:27.740]  They know their time is short.
[02:53:27.740 --> 02:53:29.740]  They know it, so that is why they are trying.
[02:53:29.740 --> 02:53:32.740]  They are hitting humanity, hitting our children,
[02:53:32.740 --> 02:53:34.740]  families with just everything that they have.
[02:53:34.740 --> 02:53:37.740]  The word of God says Satan has come with great wrath
[02:53:37.740 --> 02:53:39.740]  because he knows his time is short.
[02:53:39.740 --> 02:53:41.740]  So I want to tell everybody that's listening to me,
[02:53:41.740 --> 02:53:43.740]  if you've not given your life to Jesus,
[02:53:43.740 --> 02:53:45.740]  you better call on Jesus because at the end of the day,
[02:53:45.740 --> 02:53:48.740]  it's going to be a battle between the devil and Jesus.
[02:53:48.740 --> 02:53:50.740]  You don't listen to me if craziness happens
[02:53:50.740 --> 02:53:53.740]  just by screaming Jesus because the Bible says
[02:53:53.740 --> 02:53:55.740]  anyone that calls on the name of Jesus shall be saved.
[02:53:55.740 --> 02:53:57.740]  That is our way out.
[02:53:57.740 --> 02:53:59.740]  We have a 30-day prayer program coming on.
[02:53:59.740 --> 02:54:01.740]  We want to get together, bring pastors,
[02:54:01.740 --> 02:54:03.740]  get together, cry out to God,
[02:54:03.740 --> 02:54:06.740]  not because we want to change the course of the matter.
[02:54:06.740 --> 02:54:08.740]  We want to make sure that people's minds open,
[02:54:08.740 --> 02:54:10.740]  people know the truth,
[02:54:10.740 --> 02:54:12.740]  and people can fight back and be victorious.
[02:54:12.740 --> 02:54:15.740]  Well, it's not hard now because people really get
[02:54:15.740 --> 02:54:17.740]  it's good versus evil now.
[02:54:17.740 --> 02:54:20.740]  It's going to get so obvious, isn't it?
[02:54:20.740 --> 02:54:22.740]  And when they do, they will look for a way out.
[02:54:22.740 --> 02:54:24.740]  They'll be looking for a way out.
[02:54:24.740 --> 02:54:27.740]  That is why I tell Christians, share Jesus with everybody.
[02:54:27.740 --> 02:54:30.740]  When it gets crazy, they will remember what you told them.
[02:54:30.740 --> 02:54:32.740]  Just sow this seed, tell them, give your life to Christ,
[02:54:32.740 --> 02:54:35.740]  turn to Jesus, leave this witchcraft that you're doing
[02:54:35.740 --> 02:54:36.740]  and turn to Jesus.
[02:54:36.740 --> 02:54:38.740]  When things get crazy, because you see,
[02:54:38.740 --> 02:54:40.740]  all these low-class apprentice witches,
[02:54:40.740 --> 02:54:42.740]  they think that Satan is, oh, we got this,
[02:54:42.740 --> 02:54:45.740]  unto they will see the devil, they will see real evil
[02:54:45.740 --> 02:54:46.740]  and they will realize, oh my God,
[02:54:46.740 --> 02:54:48.740]  maybe I shouldn't have been following Satan.
[02:54:48.740 --> 02:54:50.740]  And they are useful idiots.
[02:54:50.740 --> 02:54:53.740]  If you're a human being and you're walking with the devil,
[02:54:53.740 --> 02:54:55.740]  you're a useful idiot.
[02:54:55.740 --> 02:54:58.740]  Exactly, they pretend like they're on a winning team.
[02:54:58.740 --> 02:55:00.740]  The devil's going to destroy them.
[02:55:00.740 --> 02:55:01.740]  He's going to destroy them.
[02:55:01.740 --> 02:55:04.740]  You cannot possibly, the devil hates all human beings.
[02:55:04.740 --> 02:55:06.740]  Hates with perfect hatred.
[02:55:06.740 --> 02:55:07.740]  Why does God hate humans?
[02:55:07.740 --> 02:55:08.740]  We're made in the image of God.
[02:55:08.740 --> 02:55:10.740]  That God hates the devil?
[02:55:10.740 --> 02:55:12.740]  No, no, why does the devil hate us?
[02:55:12.740 --> 02:55:13.740]  Because we're made in the image of God.
[02:55:13.740 --> 02:55:15.740]  He hates us because God loves us.
[02:55:15.740 --> 02:55:18.740]  He hates us because we have a chance to repent
[02:55:18.740 --> 02:55:19.740]  and get forgiveness.
[02:55:19.740 --> 02:55:20.740]  He doesn't.
[02:55:20.740 --> 02:55:22.740]  He has already been condemned.
[02:55:22.740 --> 02:55:23.740]  We know his end.
[02:55:23.740 --> 02:55:25.740]  He's going to end up in the lake of fire.
[02:55:25.740 --> 02:55:27.740]  So he's a loser and wants to claw us down with him.
[02:55:27.740 --> 02:55:30.740]  He wants to take as many people as possible,
[02:55:30.740 --> 02:55:32.740]  kill them before they give their life to Christ,
[02:55:32.740 --> 02:55:34.740]  destroy them before they have the strength to stand,
[02:55:34.740 --> 02:55:37.740]  before the revival comes and opens the minds of people.
[02:55:37.740 --> 02:55:39.740]  He wants to take as many people as possible with him
[02:55:39.740 --> 02:55:40.740]  to the lake of fire.
[02:55:40.740 --> 02:55:42.740]  But we know where his end is.
[02:55:42.740 --> 02:55:44.740]  That's why I tell people, give your life to Christ,
[02:55:44.740 --> 02:55:46.740]  read the Bible, know God and stand.
[02:55:46.740 --> 02:55:48.740]  Stand and rebuke these demons.
[02:55:48.740 --> 02:55:51.740]  If many more Christians were rebuking these demons,
[02:55:51.740 --> 02:55:56.740]  they will crawl into the abyss where they were created.
[02:55:56.740 --> 02:55:58.740]  Wow, it's going to be spectacular.
[02:55:58.740 --> 02:56:02.740]  Because people can really see evil as like running rampant right now.
[02:56:02.740 --> 02:56:05.740]  Yes, but God is strong.
[02:56:05.740 --> 02:56:08.740]  God is doing a lot of work, but people have to turn to God.
[02:56:09.740 --> 02:56:12.740]  You see, Alex, the atmosphere,
[02:56:12.740 --> 02:56:15.740]  the reason why you see a lot of people are weak in their faith,
[02:56:15.740 --> 02:56:17.740]  people are living in sin, living in iniquity,
[02:56:17.740 --> 02:56:19.740]  doing things that are not,
[02:56:19.740 --> 02:56:21.740]  because when you're living in sin and iniquity,
[02:56:21.740 --> 02:56:25.740]  you're basically giving the devil a right to harass your life.
[02:56:25.740 --> 02:56:29.740]  But the reason that is happening is because there's layers and layers of darkness
[02:56:29.740 --> 02:56:31.740]  from all this demonic stuff.
[02:56:31.740 --> 02:56:34.740]  And there's years and years of doctrinal programming
[02:56:34.740 --> 02:56:36.740]  that has programmed the church to be weak.
[02:56:36.740 --> 02:56:39.740]  So the church has to wake up and be strong.
[02:56:39.740 --> 02:56:41.740]  People have to wake up and say,
[02:56:41.740 --> 02:56:44.740]  listen, God is not going to judge you based on what your pastor taught you,
[02:56:44.740 --> 02:56:46.740]  it's going to be based on the Word of God.
[02:56:46.740 --> 02:56:48.740]  Christians have to get back to the Word of God,
[02:56:48.740 --> 02:56:50.740]  get back to studying the Bible,
[02:56:50.740 --> 02:56:52.740]  get back to being strong spiritually,
[02:56:52.740 --> 02:56:54.740]  ask the Holy Spirit to strengthen you,
[02:56:54.740 --> 02:56:56.740]  ask the Holy Spirit to draw you into His Word,
[02:56:56.740 --> 02:56:59.740]  because you are the people that are supposed to be light,
[02:56:59.740 --> 02:57:00.740]  we are the light of the world,
[02:57:00.740 --> 02:57:03.740]  we are the ones that are supposed to fight this battle against evil.
[02:57:03.740 --> 02:57:07.740]  The patriots need to get discipled really to Christ,
[02:57:07.740 --> 02:57:09.740]  because right now a lot of patriots,
[02:57:09.740 --> 02:57:11.740]  they are coming to it's good versus evil,
[02:57:11.740 --> 02:57:13.740]  they are coming to we want God,
[02:57:13.740 --> 02:57:14.740]  but there's no discipleship.
[02:57:14.740 --> 02:57:17.740]  So there's a lot of mingling and a lot of stuff,
[02:57:17.740 --> 02:57:20.740]  a lot of new age stuff being mingled like the devil usually do.
[02:57:20.740 --> 02:57:22.740]  So we need people to get back to the Bible
[02:57:22.740 --> 02:57:24.740]  and disciple those that are coming to Christ
[02:57:24.740 --> 02:57:26.740]  and know that it is time,
[02:57:26.740 --> 02:57:28.740]  this is going to be an amazing battle.
[02:57:28.740 --> 02:57:30.740]  Those that know they are God,
[02:57:30.740 --> 02:57:32.740]  they will be strong and they will do exploits.
[02:57:32.740 --> 02:57:34.740]  And then be ready, be physically ready,
[02:57:34.740 --> 02:57:36.740]  spiritually ready, financially ready,
[02:57:36.740 --> 02:57:38.740]  get your money out of the banking system,
[02:57:38.740 --> 02:57:39.740]  because it's going to crash.

[02:58:47.740 --> 02:58:49.740]  I'm a huge believer in information.
[02:58:49.740 --> 02:58:53.740]  I watch Infowars every day and follow Alex Jones closely.
[02:58:53.740 --> 02:58:55.740]  You know why? He can put you ahead of the curve.
[02:58:55.740 --> 02:58:58.740]  And he's been demonized as a conspiracy theorist.
[02:58:58.740 --> 02:59:01.740]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[02:59:01.740 --> 02:59:05.740]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[02:59:07.740 --> 02:59:10.740]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[02:59:10.740 --> 02:59:11.740]  This is reality.
[02:59:11.740 --> 02:59:13.740]  It just pancakes.
[02:59:13.740 --> 02:59:16.740]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[02:59:16.740 --> 02:59:18.740]  The revolution of peaceful information is coming,
[02:59:18.740 --> 02:59:21.740]  and when it comes time, you people are going to be brought to punishment.
[02:59:21.740 --> 02:59:23.740]  You're lying to the public. It's disgusting.
[02:59:23.740 --> 02:59:26.740]  The media continues to misrepresent what I've said.
[02:59:26.740 --> 02:59:29.740]  He may be America's best-known conspiracy theorist.
[02:59:29.740 --> 02:59:33.740]  Alex Jones has the largest audience in the country,
[02:59:33.740 --> 02:59:37.740]  bigger than any of the networks, the biggest megaphone in the country.
[02:59:37.740 --> 02:59:41.740]  We're going to get fired up about the real things, the things that matter!
[02:59:45.740 --> 02:59:47.740]  Burn in hell, New World Order.
[02:59:48.740 --> 02:59:53.740]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[02:59:53.740 --> 02:59:55.740]  it's Alex Jones.
[02:59:56.740 --> 02:59:58.740]  The New World Order.
[03:00:14.740 --> 03:00:17.740]  Dr. Stella, your take on S686.
[03:00:17.740 --> 03:00:19.740]  It's not taking over TikTok.
[03:00:19.740 --> 03:00:24.740]  It says it takes over all your devices in your house and controls everything you do.
[03:00:24.740 --> 03:00:27.740]  I get TikTok's got problems, but their answer to TikTok
[03:00:27.740 --> 03:00:29.740]  is something a thousand times worse.
[03:00:29.740 --> 03:00:33.740]  Yes, so what they are trying to do is be able to monitor everybody.
[03:00:33.740 --> 03:00:38.740]  One, I think it was the ex-wife of Elon Musk,
[03:00:38.740 --> 03:00:42.740]  said we're going to be techno-human, you know, homo-techno.
[03:00:42.740 --> 03:00:44.740]  So they want to make sure that with our phones and everything
[03:00:44.740 --> 03:00:46.740]  that they are able to monitor us.
[03:00:46.740 --> 03:00:47.740]  This is about control.
[03:00:47.740 --> 03:00:52.740]  This is about a digital dictatorship, and we need to rise up.
[03:00:52.740 --> 03:00:54.740]  You know, it's a digital dictatorship they are trying to put together.
[03:00:54.740 --> 03:00:58.740]  From our phones, everything in our houses right now is smart this, smart that.
[03:00:59.740 --> 03:01:02.740]  And I love how they used one threat to make something way worse.
[03:01:03.740 --> 03:01:06.740]  Yeah, like they did with FTX.
[03:01:07.740 --> 03:01:09.740]  They knocked down FTX and then banks are coming down
[03:01:09.740 --> 03:01:11.740]  and then they're using the banks to bring in Fentanyl.
[03:01:12.740 --> 03:01:14.740]  So when one bad thing is happening, you know,
[03:01:14.740 --> 03:01:16.740]  during the time they were threatening President Trump,
[03:01:16.740 --> 03:01:19.740]  we're all focused on President Trump, and then Fentanyl comes in.
[03:01:20.740 --> 03:01:22.740]  Wow, Fentanyl's killed a lot of folks.
[03:01:22.740 --> 03:01:23.740]  Fed now.
[03:01:23.740 --> 03:01:24.740]  Fed now, yeah.
[03:01:24.740 --> 03:01:29.740]  Yes, Fentanyl, the digital currency that every bank has to have it up by July in America.
[03:01:29.740 --> 03:01:31.740]  Yeah, you're talking about the whole central bank digital currency, yeah.
[03:01:31.740 --> 03:01:36.740]  So everybody's just, people will be prepared, go home, you know,
[03:01:36.740 --> 03:01:39.740]  get together, buy an acre somewhere and, you know,
[03:01:39.740 --> 03:01:41.740]  and get together and build communities where you can.
[03:01:41.740 --> 03:01:43.740]  Boy, won't it be the people that have flooded the country?
[03:01:43.740 --> 03:01:44.740]  They're going to be a smart one soon.
[03:01:45.740 --> 03:01:47.740]  So people that are in the countries who survive,
[03:01:47.740 --> 03:01:51.740]  people that have learned to be in a situation where they can survive
[03:01:51.740 --> 03:01:55.740]  without, like, some of the amenities that we have that we take for granted.
[03:01:55.740 --> 03:01:58.740]  So, you know, everybody needs to be prepared.
[03:01:58.740 --> 03:02:00.740]  You know, get into communities.
[03:02:00.740 --> 03:02:02.740]  If you have an acre somewhere or somebody has a farm,
[03:02:02.740 --> 03:02:04.740]  you guys get into, learn to farm, grow your own food,
[03:02:04.740 --> 03:02:07.740]  get chicken, get cows, get whatever you can get now.
[03:02:07.740 --> 03:02:10.740]  Stock up food, stock up water, get a charcoal grill.
[03:02:10.740 --> 03:02:12.740]  If there's no electricity, you can cook with a charcoal grill.
[03:02:12.740 --> 03:02:14.740]  You can use it to heat up your house.
[03:02:14.740 --> 03:02:15.740]  Get solar.
[03:02:15.740 --> 03:02:16.740]  If we don't have solar,
[03:02:16.740 --> 03:02:18.740]  make sure you have a small generator to charge your batteries.
[03:02:18.740 --> 03:02:21.740]  People just need to be ready and have a mindset.
[03:02:21.740 --> 03:02:22.740]  Get your money out of the house.
[03:02:22.740 --> 03:02:24.740]  A mindset that the old system's coming down.
[03:02:24.740 --> 03:02:25.740]  Yes, it's coming down.
[03:02:25.740 --> 03:02:28.740]  This system, you see, in Revelation chapter 14,
[03:02:28.740 --> 03:02:30.740]  angels do a few things.
[03:02:30.740 --> 03:02:32.740]  One of the things that the angels do in Revelation 14 is tell people
[03:02:32.740 --> 03:02:34.740]  that the Babylonian system is about to be destroyed.
[03:02:34.740 --> 03:02:36.740]  So we need to make sure that...
[03:02:36.740 --> 03:02:37.740]  Falls in one hour.
[03:02:37.740 --> 03:02:38.740]  Yes, in one hour.
[03:02:38.740 --> 03:02:39.740]  Only a computer can fall in one hour.
[03:02:39.740 --> 03:02:40.740]  I know, right?
[03:02:40.740 --> 03:02:41.740]  Babylon, I know.
[03:02:41.740 --> 03:02:43.740]  Yeah, so we have to be prepared.
[03:02:43.740 --> 03:02:45.740]  And we have to be prepared medically.
[03:02:45.740 --> 03:02:47.740]  If you're on insulin, you can go to Walmart
[03:02:47.740 --> 03:02:50.740]  and buy regular insulin and just stock up in your house
[03:02:50.740 --> 03:02:53.740]  in case things get really bad and get your prescription.
[03:02:53.740 --> 03:02:54.740]  So we did a few things.
[03:02:54.740 --> 03:02:56.740]  We have medical prescriptions.
[03:02:56.740 --> 03:02:58.740]  We have medical prescriptions
[03:02:58.740 --> 03:03:00.740]  where you can get your generic drugs.
[03:03:00.740 --> 03:03:02.740]  We're working with some pharmaceutical companies
[03:03:02.740 --> 03:03:05.740]  and the doctors so that they can give you your generic drugs.
[03:03:05.740 --> 03:03:08.740]  You can get at least one year supply of your medicine.
[03:03:08.740 --> 03:03:09.740]  We have the COVID Care Complete
[03:03:09.740 --> 03:03:11.740]  where you have hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin,
[03:03:12.740 --> 03:03:15.740]  butesenite, and you have a nebulizer with it and Z-Pak.
[03:03:15.740 --> 03:03:17.740]  If you get COVID, it gives you everything
[03:03:17.740 --> 03:03:19.740]  that you can do step by step.
[03:03:19.740 --> 03:03:21.740]  We review your medical records before we do this.
[03:03:21.740 --> 03:03:23.740]  And then we also have the,
[03:03:23.740 --> 03:03:25.740]  we call it medical preparedness basic.
[03:03:25.740 --> 03:03:27.740]  What are the five antibiotics you will need
[03:03:27.740 --> 03:03:30.740]  if there's an emergency?
[03:03:30.740 --> 03:03:32.740]  You need something for the upper respiratory
[03:03:32.740 --> 03:03:34.740]  which is sore throat, amoxicillin.
[03:03:34.740 --> 03:03:36.740]  For sore throat, tooth infection and everything.
[03:03:36.740 --> 03:03:37.740]  You need an eye drop.
[03:03:37.740 --> 03:03:39.740]  You need something for your GI tract, flagial.
[03:03:39.740 --> 03:03:42.740]  You need something for your chest infections like Z-Pak.
[03:03:42.740 --> 03:03:44.740]  You need Bactrim that can both work
[03:03:44.740 --> 03:03:46.740]  for urinary tract infection and skin infections.
[03:03:46.740 --> 03:03:48.740]  So people need to have that mindset
[03:03:48.740 --> 03:03:50.740]  that if something happens and I cannot get out of my house,
[03:03:50.740 --> 03:03:51.740]  what do we do?
[03:03:51.740 --> 03:03:53.740]  So that is why if you go on our website,
[03:03:53.740 --> 03:03:56.740]  drsalaemd.com, we have acute care now too, though.
[03:03:56.740 --> 03:03:57.740]  I didn't talk about that.
[03:03:57.740 --> 03:03:58.740]  We have acute care.
[03:03:58.740 --> 03:04:00.740]  Initially, we were just doing COVID care,
[03:04:00.740 --> 03:04:01.740]  but right now we have acute care.
[03:04:01.740 --> 03:04:03.740]  We have doctors that are going to see you
[03:04:03.740 --> 03:04:05.740]  for other things apart from just COVID,
[03:04:05.740 --> 03:04:07.740]  you know, cough, runny nose, sore throat.
[03:04:07.740 --> 03:04:09.740]  There are many people that are kind of scared
[03:04:09.740 --> 03:04:10.740]  to go to the doctors.
[03:04:10.740 --> 03:04:12.740]  It's not everything we can do via telemedicine,
[03:04:12.740 --> 03:04:14.740]  but the lot that we can do via telemedicine
[03:04:14.740 --> 03:04:15.740]  if you go on our website right now.
[03:04:15.740 --> 03:04:16.740]  And that was something Trump did
[03:04:16.740 --> 03:04:17.740]  was legalizing telemedicine.
[03:04:17.740 --> 03:04:20.740]  Yes, but he didn't legalize telemedicine
[03:04:20.740 --> 03:04:21.740]  around the whole country,
[03:04:21.740 --> 03:04:23.740]  but we can actually, we have doctors
[03:04:23.740 --> 03:04:25.740]  that are licensed in all states
[03:04:25.740 --> 03:04:28.740]  that will actually take care of the patients.
[03:04:28.740 --> 03:04:29.740]  All right, Dr. Sella Emmanuel,
[03:04:29.740 --> 03:04:31.740]  thank you for coming to the studio.
[03:04:31.740 --> 03:04:34.740]  And tell you what, if you use Alex,
[03:04:34.740 --> 03:04:36.740]  promo code Alex on our website,
[03:04:36.740 --> 03:04:38.740]  you can help fund InfoWars
[03:04:38.740 --> 03:04:39.740]  and also give people a discount.
[03:04:39.740 --> 03:04:41.740]  I forgot to mention that.
[03:04:41.740 --> 03:04:43.740]  Promo code Alex, Dr. SellaMD.com.
[03:04:43.740 --> 03:04:44.740]  Alex on our website, yes.
[03:04:44.740 --> 03:04:47.740]  So we're just here to make sure that people are ready.
[03:04:47.740 --> 03:04:48.740]  You've been a big supporter.
[03:04:48.740 --> 03:04:50.740]  We really appreciate you.
[03:04:50.740 --> 03:04:51.740]  We'll hand the baton to the next guest,
[03:04:51.740 --> 03:04:52.740]  but I want you to spend a few minutes on that
[03:04:52.740 --> 03:04:53.740]  when we come back.
[03:04:53.740 --> 03:04:54.740]  We'll be right back in one minute.
[03:04:57.740 --> 03:04:58.740]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[03:04:58.740 --> 03:05:01.740]  InfoWars has proven itself the last 28 years
[03:05:01.740 --> 03:05:03.740]  to be over the globalist target
[03:05:03.740 --> 03:05:05.740]  and having the biggest effect out there
[03:05:05.740 --> 03:05:06.740]  against those tyrants.
[03:05:06.740 --> 03:05:08.740]  And we fund our operation with viewers
[03:05:08.740 --> 03:05:10.740]  and listeners' support while selling you
[03:05:10.740 --> 03:05:11.740]  great products at the same time.
[03:05:11.740 --> 03:05:13.740]  So I want to thank all the viewers
[03:05:13.740 --> 03:05:14.740]  and listeners who have supported us
[03:05:14.740 --> 03:05:16.740]  over the years by spreading the word,
[03:05:16.740 --> 03:05:17.740]  praying for the broadcast,
[03:05:17.740 --> 03:05:18.740]  and buying product.
[03:05:18.740 --> 03:05:20.740]  But I really want to encourage those of you
[03:05:20.740 --> 03:05:21.740]  that have been on the fence
[03:05:21.740 --> 03:05:22.740]  and have never actually gone to
[03:05:22.740 --> 03:05:24.740]  InfoWarsStore.com to go there
[03:05:24.740 --> 03:05:27.740]  and get the great books and films
[03:05:27.740 --> 03:05:29.740]  and supplements and survival gear
[03:05:29.740 --> 03:05:31.740]  that's there that won't just empower you
[03:05:31.740 --> 03:05:32.740]  and enrich your life,
[03:05:32.740 --> 03:05:35.740]  but, again, will keep this broadcast transmitting.

[03:05:44.740 --> 03:05:46.740]  that's back in stock, it's all there.

[03:06:02.740 --> 03:06:31.740]  The Korea Sea is about to take over from Australia.
[03:06:31.740 --> 03:06:34.740]  But I had totally forgotten that Dr. Stella Emanuel
[03:06:34.740 --> 03:06:36.740]  had talked about what she did two months ago,
[03:06:36.740 --> 03:06:37.740]  where she said,
[03:06:37.740 --> 03:06:38.740]  for the next week,
[03:06:38.740 --> 03:06:39.740]  I'm going to donate the proceeds
[03:06:39.740 --> 03:06:41.740]  of any profit to InfoWars.
[03:06:41.740 --> 03:06:42.740]  It was a giant donation
[03:06:42.740 --> 03:06:44.740]  that really took us over the top.
[03:06:44.740 --> 03:06:47.740]  We would actually have been in the black in the red
[03:06:47.740 --> 03:06:49.740]  if she hadn't have done that.
[03:06:49.740 --> 03:06:50.740]  She pushed us into the black.
[03:06:50.740 --> 03:06:52.740]  Well, what a great lady.
[03:06:52.740 --> 03:06:53.740]  But I was promoting her
[03:06:53.740 --> 03:06:55.740]  just because she was one of the first doctors
[03:06:55.740 --> 03:06:56.740]  to go public with therapeutics
[03:06:56.740 --> 03:06:59.740]  and has now served over 100,000 people.
[03:06:59.740 --> 03:07:01.740]  DrStellaMD.com.
[03:07:01.740 --> 03:07:03.740]  But you got cut off on the last break
[03:07:03.740 --> 03:07:05.740]  before we hand the baton to Maria Z,
[03:07:05.740 --> 03:07:07.740]  talking about all the great things you've got.
[03:07:07.740 --> 03:07:09.740]  People have got to get ready.
[03:07:09.740 --> 03:07:10.740]  And if they use promo code Alex,
[03:07:10.740 --> 03:07:11.740]  they get a discount.
[03:07:11.740 --> 03:07:13.740]  And then you're actually going to sponsor us.
[03:07:13.740 --> 03:07:14.740]  So I hadn't even really thought about that.
[03:07:14.740 --> 03:07:15.740]  Thanks for that offer.
[03:07:15.740 --> 03:07:17.740]  You told me before the show started,
[03:07:17.740 --> 03:07:18.740]  and I just didn't even think about it,
[03:07:18.740 --> 03:07:19.740]  but thank you.
[03:07:19.740 --> 03:07:20.740]  Yeah, so we want to make sure
[03:07:20.740 --> 03:07:22.740]  that if people can't go on our website,
[03:07:22.740 --> 03:07:24.740]  like I said, we even do detox.
[03:07:24.740 --> 03:07:25.740]  We have detox for the spike protein,
[03:07:25.740 --> 03:07:27.740]  whether people are having COVID lung symptoms
[03:07:28.740 --> 03:07:30.740]  or they got jabbed and they need to repent.
[03:07:30.740 --> 03:07:31.740]  We have that.
[03:07:31.740 --> 03:07:32.740]  We have medication for people
[03:07:32.740 --> 03:07:34.740]  so that you can get your regular prescriptions.
[03:07:34.740 --> 03:07:35.740]  We do acute care
[03:07:35.740 --> 03:07:37.740]  where you can see doctors for other things.
[03:07:37.740 --> 03:07:39.740]  We have personal prescriptions.
[03:07:39.740 --> 03:07:42.740]  We have all kinds of things on our website to be prepared.
[03:07:42.740 --> 03:07:44.740]  We have a plandemic prep pack.
[03:07:44.740 --> 03:07:46.740]  So I'm saying that if you go on our website,
[03:07:46.740 --> 03:07:47.740]  use promo code Alex,
[03:07:47.740 --> 03:07:49.740]  and they will donate a good process of it.
[03:07:49.740 --> 03:07:51.740]  Usually we just, whatever you do,
[03:07:51.740 --> 03:07:53.740]  we're going to make sure that we donate a good bit
[03:07:53.740 --> 03:07:55.740]  to keep this show on air.
[03:07:55.740 --> 03:07:57.740]  You know, Alex, you've really been fighting this battle
[03:07:57.740 --> 03:07:59.740]  and we need to support you, period.
[03:07:59.740 --> 03:08:00.740]  That's what I think.
[03:08:00.740 --> 03:08:01.740]  So go on our website,
[03:08:01.740 --> 03:08:02.740]  support what we're doing,
[03:08:02.740 --> 03:08:04.740]  and then we're going to give,
[03:08:04.740 --> 03:08:05.740]  we're going to make sure
[03:08:05.740 --> 03:08:07.740]  that we give some major proceeds to Alex
[03:08:07.740 --> 03:08:08.740]  to keep him on air,
[03:08:08.740 --> 03:08:09.740]  make sure that he keeps talking
[03:08:09.740 --> 03:08:11.740]  and keeps educating everyone.
[03:08:11.740 --> 03:08:13.740]  Well, you've been a great supporter without me asking.
[03:08:13.740 --> 03:08:14.740]  You're on as a guest
[03:08:14.740 --> 03:08:16.740]  and you just did like a five-minute plug
[03:08:16.740 --> 03:08:17.740]  and we got massive support,
[03:08:17.740 --> 03:08:18.740]  so thank you so much.
[03:08:18.740 --> 03:08:20.740]  Plus, people need all of this
[03:08:20.740 --> 03:08:21.740]  to help themselves, help their families.
[03:08:21.740 --> 03:08:23.740]  So recap some of the great products you've got
[03:08:23.740 --> 03:08:25.740]  at drcellamd.com.
[03:08:25.740 --> 03:08:28.740]  Yeah, we have the acute care,
[03:08:28.740 --> 03:08:30.740]  if you want to see a doctor in all 50 states.
[03:08:30.740 --> 03:08:31.740]  Remember, all 50 states,
[03:08:31.740 --> 03:08:33.740]  pharmacists in all 50 states.
[03:08:33.740 --> 03:08:34.740]  We have COVID Care Complete,
[03:08:34.740 --> 03:08:37.740]  where you can get all the things you need for COVID.
[03:08:37.740 --> 03:08:38.740]  Ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine,
[03:08:38.740 --> 03:08:41.740]  butesanide, and anabolizer, and Z-Pak.
[03:08:41.740 --> 03:08:43.740]  We have the Medica preparedness,
[03:08:43.740 --> 03:08:45.740]  like what are the five antibiotics
[03:08:45.740 --> 03:08:46.740]  you will need in an emergency.
[03:08:46.740 --> 03:08:47.740]  And by the way,
[03:08:47.740 --> 03:08:48.740]  the lowest prices I've found anywhere.
[03:08:48.740 --> 03:08:49.740]  Yes, of course.
[03:08:49.740 --> 03:08:51.740]  I talk with my pharmacists.
[03:08:51.740 --> 03:08:52.740]  Like right now we have genetic drug lists,
[03:08:52.740 --> 03:08:54.740]  where we can help people get generic drugs
[03:08:54.740 --> 03:08:57.740]  for up to a year for the medicines they are already using.
[03:08:57.740 --> 03:09:00.740]  And if you go on our marketplace,
[03:09:00.740 --> 03:09:03.740]  we have what we call the Plandemic Prep Pack.
[03:09:03.740 --> 03:09:05.740]  You know, we have detox for vaccines.
[03:09:05.740 --> 03:09:06.740]  We have a lot of things.
[03:09:06.740 --> 03:09:08.740]  We have detox to help people deal with the spike protein.
[03:09:08.740 --> 03:09:11.740]  And we have all kinds of things we have prepared.
[03:09:11.740 --> 03:09:13.740]  We have all kinds of immune support
[03:09:13.740 --> 03:09:15.740]  against Ebola, against COVID,
[03:09:15.740 --> 03:09:18.740]  against Spox, against all kinds of things.
[03:09:18.740 --> 03:09:19.740]  So, yeah.
[03:09:19.740 --> 03:09:20.740]  Whatever they might throw at us,
[03:09:20.740 --> 03:09:21.740]  Dr. Stella.
[03:09:22.740 --> 03:09:23.740]  MD.com or StellaMD.com.
[03:09:23.740 --> 03:09:25.740]  And the phone number is on the website as well.
[03:09:25.740 --> 03:09:26.740]  Doctor, thank you.
[03:09:26.740 --> 03:09:27.740]  It's great to meet your family.
[03:09:27.740 --> 03:09:29.740]  Thank you for coming in.
[03:09:29.740 --> 03:09:32.740]  And congratulations on being a trailblazer.
[03:09:32.740 --> 03:09:34.740]  In closing, how vindicated do you...
[03:09:34.740 --> 03:09:35.740]  I know you don't care about vindication,
[03:09:35.740 --> 03:09:38.740]  but man, everything you said three years ago
[03:09:38.740 --> 03:09:39.740]  turned out to be true.
[03:09:39.740 --> 03:09:40.740]  About the therapeutics, all of it.
[03:09:40.740 --> 03:09:42.740]  We've all been proven right.
[03:09:42.740 --> 03:09:43.740]  Now it's all out in the open.
[03:09:43.740 --> 03:09:44.740]  We can't just now go,
[03:09:44.740 --> 03:09:46.740]  okay, we're right, move on.
[03:09:46.740 --> 03:09:48.740]  We've got to hammer the fact that globalists were lying.
[03:09:48.740 --> 03:09:50.740]  Yes, they were lying.
[03:09:50.740 --> 03:09:52.740]  And we've got to hammer the fact that it's not over.
[03:09:52.740 --> 03:09:55.740]  Right now, it's just the calm before the storm.
[03:09:55.740 --> 03:09:57.740]  And Alex, I wish I was wrong.
[03:09:57.740 --> 03:09:59.740]  And I'm sure you wish that too.
[03:09:59.740 --> 03:10:01.740]  Sometimes we wish all the things we said was wrong.
[03:10:01.740 --> 03:10:04.740]  But remember, we are still in a battle.
[03:10:04.740 --> 03:10:06.740]  Be prepared for your family.
[03:10:06.740 --> 03:10:07.740]  Give your life to Christ.
[03:10:07.740 --> 03:10:09.740]  At the end of the day, it's good versus evil.
[03:10:09.740 --> 03:10:12.740]  If anything hits you and you don't remember anything,
[03:10:12.740 --> 03:10:14.740]  call on the name of Jesus and you'll be successful.
[03:10:14.740 --> 03:10:16.740]  Because it's an energetic, spiritual choice
[03:10:16.740 --> 03:10:19.740]  of I choose God, I choose Christ.
[03:10:19.740 --> 03:10:20.740]  You win right there, folks.
[03:10:20.740 --> 03:10:24.740]  You are an energetic, real spiritual creature that's eternal.
[03:10:24.740 --> 03:10:26.740]  You've got to decide who you're with.
[03:10:26.740 --> 03:10:27.740]  Yes, who we're with.
[03:10:27.740 --> 03:10:29.740]  We have a ranch in Patterson.
[03:10:29.740 --> 03:10:30.740]  You go on our website.
[03:10:30.740 --> 03:10:31.740]  You go on that Bethel Ranch.
[03:10:31.740 --> 03:10:33.740]  We have a 30-day prayer program coming.
[03:10:33.740 --> 03:10:34.740]  Christians are invited to come pray.
[03:10:34.740 --> 03:10:36.740]  Not witches, just Christians.
[03:10:36.740 --> 03:10:38.740]  They are invited to come pray and to just seek God
[03:10:38.740 --> 03:10:41.740]  and grow spiritually so that they can go back into the battle.
[03:10:41.740 --> 03:10:42.740]  It's like a retreat.
[03:10:42.740 --> 03:10:44.740]  And people stay there for free.
[03:10:44.740 --> 03:10:45.740]  We don't charge anything.
[03:10:45.740 --> 03:10:46.740]  Beautiful.
[03:10:46.740 --> 03:10:47.740]  I might come to that.
[03:10:47.740 --> 03:10:48.740]  When is that?
[03:10:48.740 --> 03:10:50.740]  From the 1st to the 30th.
[03:10:50.740 --> 03:10:53.740]  From the 1st of April to the 30th of April, 30 days,
[03:10:53.740 --> 03:10:55.740]  we have ministers coming from all over the world
[03:10:55.740 --> 03:10:57.740]  and people are going to come and pray
[03:10:57.740 --> 03:11:00.740]  and just get empowered spiritually.
[03:11:00.740 --> 03:11:02.740]  You know, sometimes you fight and you're drained.
[03:11:02.740 --> 03:11:04.740]  You need to be empowered spiritually.
[03:11:04.740 --> 03:11:06.740]  You need to be refreshed and refilled
[03:11:06.740 --> 03:11:08.740]  so you can go back into the battle.
[03:11:08.740 --> 03:11:09.740]  And it's of no cost.
[03:11:09.740 --> 03:11:11.740]  You know, we have housing and people stay for free.
[03:11:11.740 --> 03:11:12.740]  You're a beautiful person.
[03:11:12.740 --> 03:11:14.740]  I can feel the Holy Spirit.
[03:11:14.740 --> 03:11:17.740]  Thank you, Dr. Stella Emanuel, DrStellaMD.com.
[03:11:17.740 --> 03:11:18.740]  God bless you and thank you.
[03:11:18.740 --> 03:11:19.740]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:11:19.740 --> 03:11:20.740]  Oh, my pleasure.
[03:11:20.740 --> 03:11:21.740]  Thank you so much.
[03:11:21.740 --> 03:11:23.740]  All right, the guest host, Maria Z,
[03:11:23.740 --> 03:11:26.740]  who does a great job from the land down under,
[03:11:26.740 --> 03:11:28.740]  takes over now.
[03:11:30.740 --> 03:11:32.740]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[03:11:32.740 --> 03:11:35.740]  What a powerful, powerful segment
[03:11:35.740 --> 03:11:38.740]  with Alex and Dr. Stella Emanuel.
[03:11:38.740 --> 03:11:39.740]  Wow, I am blown away.
[03:11:39.740 --> 03:11:42.740]  Dr. Stella is absolutely right.
[03:11:42.740 --> 03:11:44.740]  And I say this unashamedly.
[03:11:44.740 --> 03:11:47.740]  The answer to the world's problems is and always
[03:11:47.740 --> 03:11:50.740]  has been Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior.
[03:11:50.740 --> 03:11:52.740]  God bless Dr. Stella for her generosity
[03:11:52.740 --> 03:11:54.740]  and her support of Infowars
[03:11:54.740 --> 03:11:57.740]  and all of the supporters of this broadcast.
[03:11:57.740 --> 03:12:00.740]  It is so amazing to see all of the freedom-loving people
[03:12:00.740 --> 03:12:02.740]  in the world coming together like this
[03:12:02.740 --> 03:12:04.740]  and supporting one another.
[03:12:04.740 --> 03:12:06.740]  And I just see such a courage in people like Alex
[03:12:06.740 --> 03:12:09.740]  and Dr. Stella and everyone on the right side of freedom,
[03:12:09.740 --> 03:12:12.740]  who, by the way, all share the same character,
[03:12:12.740 --> 03:12:17.740]  honesty, integrity, unashamed love of God.
[03:12:17.740 --> 03:12:18.740]  Great.
[03:12:18.740 --> 03:12:21.740]  Don't ever be ashamed of that.
[03:12:21.740 --> 03:12:23.740]  Generosity, love of humanity,
[03:12:23.740 --> 03:12:25.740]  this is something that they can never take away from us
[03:12:25.740 --> 03:12:28.740]  and they can never crush our will
[03:12:28.740 --> 03:12:31.740]  as long as we never let the tyrants rule our mind.
[03:12:31.740 --> 03:12:32.740]  And that is the battlefield.
[03:12:32.740 --> 03:12:35.740]  And it's important that we understand that.
[03:12:35.740 --> 03:12:39.740]  So the attacks are coming thick and fast right now.
[03:12:39.740 --> 03:12:42.740]  I think that's undeniable and everyone can see it.
[03:12:42.740 --> 03:12:44.740]  I plan to talk about one thing today
[03:12:44.740 --> 03:12:47.740]  and since then 50 things have come up
[03:12:47.740 --> 03:12:50.740]  and it is by design this way.
[03:12:50.740 --> 03:12:52.740]  I recently interviewed Michael Yon.
[03:12:52.740 --> 03:12:53.740]  I know Alex had him on recently
[03:12:53.740 --> 03:12:54.740]  and I've spoken about that interview,
[03:12:54.740 --> 03:12:57.740]  but something he said with me on information warfare
[03:12:57.740 --> 03:12:59.740]  has stuck with me ever since,
[03:12:59.740 --> 03:13:02.740]  which is that they will try to confuse you.
[03:13:02.740 --> 03:13:04.740]  They will try to get you arguing over statistics
[03:13:04.740 --> 03:13:07.740]  and send you in this constant loop
[03:13:07.740 --> 03:13:11.740]  of them denying things that are just staring us in the face.
[03:13:11.740 --> 03:13:13.740]  And the reality, it boils down to this,
[03:13:13.740 --> 03:13:15.740]  these people are criminals
[03:13:15.740 --> 03:13:17.740]  and they need to be held accountable for the crimes
[03:13:17.740 --> 03:13:19.740]  that they have committed against humanity.
[03:13:19.740 --> 03:13:21.740]  And as much as they want to sweep
[03:13:21.740 --> 03:13:22.740]  the last three years under the rug,
[03:13:22.740 --> 03:13:23.740]  we're not going to let them,
[03:13:23.740 --> 03:13:26.740]  we are going to hold these people accountable.
[03:13:26.740 --> 03:13:28.740]  But I do wanna raise this story
[03:13:28.740 --> 03:13:30.740]  before I take any calls today
[03:13:30.740 --> 03:13:32.740]  and we are gonna be taking calls
[03:13:32.740 --> 03:13:33.740]  because I think it's important
[03:13:33.740 --> 03:13:36.740]  for people to keep coming together and sharing ideas
[03:13:36.740 --> 03:13:39.740]  and I wanna hear from as many people as possible
[03:13:39.740 --> 03:13:40.740]  in the rest of this hour
[03:13:40.740 --> 03:13:42.740]  because I don't have all of the answers.
[03:13:42.740 --> 03:13:43.740]  But this first story,
[03:13:43.740 --> 03:13:45.740]  the purpose of this isn't to talk about me.
[03:13:45.740 --> 03:13:47.740]  This certainly isn't about me.
[03:13:47.740 --> 03:13:49.740]  It's about absolutely everyone
[03:13:49.740 --> 03:13:52.740]  and it ties in with what Alex was talking about earlier
[03:13:52.740 --> 03:13:54.740]  about this new legislation being proposed
[03:13:54.740 --> 03:13:56.740]  in the United States.
[03:13:56.740 --> 03:13:58.740]  So for those who don't know,
[03:13:58.740 --> 03:14:01.740]  recently 60 Minutes did this hit piece
[03:14:01.740 --> 03:14:03.740]  where they were basically labeling Christians
[03:14:03.740 --> 03:14:05.740]  and anyone who disagrees with the government
[03:14:05.740 --> 03:14:07.740]  as domestic terrorists.
[03:14:07.740 --> 03:14:08.740]  I was featured in that hit piece
[03:14:08.740 --> 03:14:13.740]  and I was subsequently very coincidentally de-banked
[03:14:13.740 --> 03:14:15.740]  around that time by ING Bank
[03:14:15.740 --> 03:14:18.740]  who has ties to the World Economic Forum
[03:14:18.740 --> 03:14:20.740]  and certainly the World Economic Forum
[03:14:20.740 --> 03:14:23.740]  hates people like us that tell you the truth
[03:14:23.740 --> 03:14:25.740]  about what's really going on in this world.
[03:14:25.740 --> 03:14:28.740]  So I can't confirm whether that was the reason
[03:14:28.740 --> 03:14:29.740]  for my de-banking,
[03:14:29.740 --> 03:14:31.740]  but it certainly is coincidental
[03:14:31.740 --> 03:14:32.740]  the timing of all of these things.
[03:14:32.740 --> 03:14:35.740]  But what it has shown me,
[03:14:35.740 --> 03:14:38.740]  and interestingly a lot of people spoke out,
[03:14:38.740 --> 03:14:40.740]  and the response that I had was
[03:14:40.740 --> 03:14:42.740]  that this is happening to a lot more people
[03:14:42.740 --> 03:14:44.740]  than people realize.
[03:14:44.740 --> 03:14:45.740]  Even people in my comments,
[03:14:45.740 --> 03:14:49.740]  people with a public social media presence
[03:14:49.740 --> 03:14:50.740]  have said,
[03:14:50.740 --> 03:14:51.740]  look, this happened to me.
[03:14:51.740 --> 03:14:52.740]  I didn't speak out about it
[03:14:52.740 --> 03:14:55.740]  because I was afraid to.
[03:14:55.740 --> 03:14:57.740]  And I think people are concerned
[03:14:57.740 --> 03:14:59.740]  and I even had those concerns.
[03:14:59.740 --> 03:15:02.740]  Maybe people will think I've done something wrong here.
[03:15:02.740 --> 03:15:05.740]  It just came out recently that Trudeau actually planned,
[03:15:05.740 --> 03:15:07.740]  the government planned to de-bank the truckers
[03:15:07.740 --> 03:15:10.740]  before they even enacted the Emergencies Act.
[03:15:10.740 --> 03:15:15.740]  So the punishment for people speaking out
[03:15:15.740 --> 03:15:19.740]  is we're witnessing this in real time now
[03:15:19.740 --> 03:15:21.740]  and people shouldn't be afraid to speak about it.
[03:15:21.740 --> 03:15:23.740]  People should be open about this
[03:15:23.740 --> 03:15:26.740]  because the more that regular people realize
[03:15:26.740 --> 03:15:28.740]  that this is their future,
[03:15:28.740 --> 03:15:29.740]  if they disagree with the government,
[03:15:29.740 --> 03:15:31.740]  the more likely they are to join us.
[03:15:31.740 --> 03:15:33.740]  We may not agree on the injections.
[03:15:33.740 --> 03:15:36.740]  We may not agree on the fact that they're a bioweapon,
[03:15:36.740 --> 03:15:38.740]  but we'll certainly agree on the fact that
[03:15:38.740 --> 03:15:40.740]  if I don't like what the government says,
[03:15:40.740 --> 03:15:41.740]  I don't want to be de-banked
[03:15:41.740 --> 03:15:44.740]  or I don't want to be switched off from society.
[03:15:44.740 --> 03:15:45.740]  So in the next segment,
[03:15:45.740 --> 03:15:47.740]  I'm going to go on a little bit more about this
[03:15:47.740 --> 03:15:48.740]  and then we're going to take some calls.
[03:15:48.740 --> 03:15:49.740]  Stay with us.
[03:15:49.740 --> 03:15:50.740]  We'll be right back.
[03:15:50.740 --> 03:15:52.740]  This is really, really important
[03:15:52.740 --> 03:15:54.740]  for all people around the world.
[03:15:54.740 --> 03:15:59.740]  Thousands of former Nazis went to work
[03:15:59.740 --> 03:16:01.740]  for the United States government.
[03:16:01.740 --> 03:16:03.740]  A flying disk has been found
[03:16:03.740 --> 03:16:05.740]  and is now in the possession of the army.
[03:16:05.740 --> 03:16:07.740]  Here is a bulletin from CBS News.
[03:16:07.740 --> 03:16:09.740]  President Kennedy has been shot.
[03:16:09.740 --> 03:16:12.740]  This is a different kind of war.
[03:16:12.740 --> 03:16:15.740]  The USS Liberty had just been attacked
[03:16:15.740 --> 03:16:17.740]  by Israeli jets and computer hurt.
[03:16:17.740 --> 03:16:20.740]  The CIA could manipulate the news in the United States.
[03:16:20.740 --> 03:16:22.740]  They took the babies out of ATVs
[03:16:22.740 --> 03:16:24.740]  and left the children to die on the Cold War.
[03:16:24.740 --> 03:16:27.740]  It was almost as if it were a planned inflection.
[03:16:27.740 --> 03:16:28.740]  It just tanked him.
[03:16:28.740 --> 03:16:31.740]  We need to go into the Capitol.
[03:16:31.740 --> 03:16:32.740]  Set! Set! Set!
[03:16:32.740 --> 03:16:34.740]  We will always have conspiracy theories.
[03:16:34.740 --> 03:16:36.740]  They are nothing but distractions.
[03:16:36.740 --> 03:16:39.740]  You guys censored Harvard educated doctors.
[03:16:39.740 --> 03:16:41.740]  You silenced those voices.
[03:16:41.740 --> 03:16:45.740]  What we want to do in Davos is push the reset button.
[03:16:45.740 --> 03:16:48.740]  As soon as we start exposing the great reset,
[03:16:48.740 --> 03:16:51.740]  the sooner these globalists start going to prison.
[03:16:51.740 --> 03:16:52.740]  President!
[03:16:57.740 --> 03:17:01.740]  If Alex Jones runs for president in the Republican Party,
[03:17:01.740 --> 03:17:04.740]  he has a chance of winning.
[03:17:07.740 --> 03:17:09.740]  If you just tuned in, you may be noticing
[03:17:09.740 --> 03:17:12.740]  I'm wearing an Alex Jones for president 2024 shirt.
[03:17:12.740 --> 03:17:15.740]  I am not seriously planning to run for president.
[03:17:15.740 --> 03:17:17.740]  This is an idea the crew had.
[03:17:17.740 --> 03:17:19.740]  I have a triggering shirt, kind of next level.
[03:17:19.740 --> 03:17:20.740]  Alex Jones is right.
[03:17:20.740 --> 03:17:22.740]  There's Infowars.com in the back.
[03:17:22.740 --> 03:17:24.740]  Alex Jones for president 2024 on the front.
[03:17:24.740 --> 03:17:26.740]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[03:17:26.740 --> 03:17:27.740]  It's made out of really nice fabric.
[03:17:27.740 --> 03:17:28.740]  It's high quality.
[03:17:28.740 --> 03:17:31.740]  And it is an exclusive shirt to Infowarsstore.com.
[03:17:31.740 --> 03:17:33.740]  And when the shirts are gone, they're gone.

[03:17:39.740 --> 03:17:41.740]  And we'll have a historic memento,
[03:17:41.740 --> 03:17:42.740]  be able to spread the word,
[03:17:42.740 --> 03:17:44.740]  meet a lot of like-minded people,
[03:17:44.740 --> 03:17:46.740]  and you'll be able to keep us on the air.
[03:17:46.740 --> 03:17:48.740]  No way. No way.
[03:17:48.740 --> 03:17:49.740]  That's a bridge too far.
[03:17:49.740 --> 03:17:51.740]  No, it can't be.
[03:17:51.740 --> 03:17:53.740]  And I said on national television that he was going to win.
[03:17:53.740 --> 03:17:56.740]  At Infowarsstore.com.

[03:18:57.740 --> 03:19:01.740]  If Alex Jones runs for president in the Republican Party,
[03:19:01.740 --> 03:19:04.740]  he has a chance of winning.
[03:19:06.740 --> 03:19:08.740]  If you just tuned in, you may be noticing
[03:19:08.740 --> 03:19:12.740]  I'm wearing an Alex Jones for president 2024 shirt.
[03:19:12.740 --> 03:19:15.740]  I am not seriously planning to run for president.
[03:19:15.740 --> 03:19:18.740]  This is an idea the crew had to have a triggering shirt,
[03:19:18.740 --> 03:19:19.740]  kind of next level.
[03:19:19.740 --> 03:19:20.740]  Alex Jones was right.
[03:19:20.740 --> 03:19:22.740]  There's Infowars.com in the back.
[03:19:22.740 --> 03:19:24.740]  Alex Jones for president 2024 on the front.
[03:19:24.740 --> 03:19:25.740]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[03:19:25.740 --> 03:19:27.740]  It's made out of really nice fabric.
[03:19:27.740 --> 03:19:28.740]  It's high quality,
[03:19:28.740 --> 03:19:31.740]  and it is a exclusive shirt to Infowarsstore.com.
[03:19:31.740 --> 03:19:33.740]  And when the shirts are gone, they're gone.
[03:19:33.740 --> 03:19:39.740]  We're doing one run of Alex Jones for president 2024 shirts,
[03:19:39.740 --> 03:19:41.740]  and we'll have a historic memento,
[03:19:41.740 --> 03:19:42.740]  be able to spread the word,
[03:19:42.740 --> 03:19:44.740]  meet a lot of like-minded people,
[03:19:44.740 --> 03:19:46.740]  and he will be able to keep us on the air.
[03:19:46.740 --> 03:19:48.740]  No way. No way.
[03:19:48.740 --> 03:19:49.740]  That's a bridge too far.
[03:19:49.740 --> 03:19:51.740]  That's no, it can't be.
[03:19:51.740 --> 03:19:53.740]  And I said on national television that he was going to win.
[03:19:53.740 --> 03:19:56.740]  At Infowarsstore.com.
[03:19:57.740 --> 03:20:01.740]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[03:20:01.740 --> 03:20:03.740]  it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:11.740 --> 03:20:13.740]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:13.740 --> 03:20:15.740]  I'm your guest host, Maria Z.
[03:20:15.740 --> 03:20:17.740]  Very soon, I'm going to be taking some calls.
[03:20:17.740 --> 03:20:20.740]  We really want to hear from people on these issues.
[03:20:20.740 --> 03:20:24.740]  So the number for that is 877-789-2539.
[03:20:24.740 --> 03:20:28.740]  That's 877-789-2539.
[03:20:28.740 --> 03:20:29.740]  Taking calls really shortly.
[03:20:29.740 --> 03:20:31.740]  But first I want to say this new legislation
[03:20:31.740 --> 03:20:33.740]  that Alex was talking about, the RESTRICT Act,
[03:20:33.740 --> 03:20:35.740]  is so alarming,
[03:20:35.740 --> 03:20:37.740]  and it ties in with what I'm talking about
[03:20:37.740 --> 03:20:41.740]  because it is about criminalizing everyone in society
[03:20:41.740 --> 03:20:43.740]  who doesn't agree with the government.
[03:20:43.740 --> 03:20:46.740]  I interviewed a military veteran from Canada some time ago,
[03:20:46.740 --> 03:20:47.740]  Jeremy McKenzie.
[03:20:47.740 --> 03:20:49.740]  I know Alex, I think, has had him on as well.
[03:20:49.740 --> 03:20:53.740]  He was de-banked, and it was for his political views.
[03:20:53.740 --> 03:20:56.740]  And he issued a very stark warning at the time.
[03:20:56.740 --> 03:20:59.740]  He said, if they can do it to me, they can do it to you.
[03:20:59.740 --> 03:21:02.740]  And you just heard that ad in between segments
[03:21:02.740 --> 03:21:05.740]  saying that they really are attacking those on the front line,
[03:21:05.740 --> 03:21:07.740]  and that is 100% true.
[03:21:07.740 --> 03:21:10.740]  They would love to scare people into silence and submission
[03:21:10.740 --> 03:21:12.740]  through these types of attacks,
[03:21:12.740 --> 03:21:14.740]  and yet it's having the opposite effect.
[03:21:14.740 --> 03:21:17.740]  We are growing in our resolve to tell the truth
[03:21:17.740 --> 03:21:19.740]  and win this war once and for all.
[03:21:19.740 --> 03:21:21.740]  And so it really is,
[03:21:21.740 --> 03:21:24.740]  while they are preparing for this social credit system
[03:21:24.740 --> 03:21:26.740]  and scaring people into submission
[03:21:26.740 --> 03:21:28.740]  and effectively canceling you out of society,
[03:21:28.740 --> 03:21:30.740]  which they started with the censorship,
[03:21:30.740 --> 03:21:33.740]  they started with pulling people off social media,
[03:21:33.740 --> 03:21:35.740]  canceling you from the public square,
[03:21:35.740 --> 03:21:39.740]  then it went to de-banking people that dare to protest,
[03:21:39.740 --> 03:21:41.740]  and now we're looking at legislation
[03:21:41.740 --> 03:21:44.740]  which is potentially going to imprison people
[03:21:44.740 --> 03:21:47.740]  for up to 20 years?
[03:21:47.740 --> 03:21:50.740]  This is serious stuff, guys.
[03:21:50.740 --> 03:21:54.740]  This is full-blown totalitarianism.
[03:21:54.740 --> 03:21:55.740]  You don't get to disagree.
[03:21:55.740 --> 03:21:58.740]  And the same Jeremy McKenzie that I'm talking about
[03:21:58.740 --> 03:22:00.740]  said something so important to me,
[03:22:00.740 --> 03:22:04.740]  which was that you may agree with everything
[03:22:04.740 --> 03:22:06.740]  that the government's doing right now,
[03:22:06.740 --> 03:22:07.740]  but in five years' time,
[03:22:07.740 --> 03:22:09.740]  you or even your child may not agree,
[03:22:09.740 --> 03:22:10.740]  but by then it'll be too late
[03:22:10.740 --> 03:22:12.740]  because all of these things are set in motion.
[03:22:12.740 --> 03:22:15.740]  There are people in society that think it's great
[03:22:15.740 --> 03:22:17.740]  that the government's putting more checks
[03:22:17.740 --> 03:22:20.740]  and measures in place to make sure
[03:22:20.740 --> 03:22:24.740]  that they control terrorists or whatever.
[03:22:24.740 --> 03:22:27.740]  They want to call people that fight for truth.
[03:22:27.740 --> 03:22:29.740]  But in five years' time,
[03:22:29.740 --> 03:22:31.740]  you may think that something that they do
[03:22:31.740 --> 03:22:34.740]  is really not in alignment with your values,
[03:22:34.740 --> 03:22:36.740]  and yet by then, you won't be able to do anything.
[03:22:36.740 --> 03:22:38.740]  In fact, you may be the next one
[03:22:38.740 --> 03:22:40.740]  that's imprisoned for 20 years.
[03:22:40.740 --> 03:22:43.740]  It's all in preparation for this social credit system
[03:22:43.740 --> 03:22:46.740]  where you are guilty until you're proven innocent.
[03:22:46.740 --> 03:22:48.740]  Prove you're not sick.
[03:22:48.740 --> 03:22:50.740]  Prove that you can be trusted.
[03:22:50.740 --> 03:22:54.740]  This zero-trust internet system that they're setting up
[03:22:54.740 --> 03:22:57.740]  is essentially you have to prove that you're innocent
[03:22:57.740 --> 03:22:59.740]  through your compliance.
[03:22:59.740 --> 03:23:02.740]  It's completely the opposite of how society
[03:23:02.740 --> 03:23:04.740]  is supposed to function in a healthy way,
[03:23:04.740 --> 03:23:05.740]  and they're doing this.
[03:23:05.740 --> 03:23:08.740]  These attacks are coming through politics,
[03:23:08.740 --> 03:23:11.740]  legislation, health, data, privacy,
[03:23:11.740 --> 03:23:13.740]  religion, relentless attacks.
[03:23:13.740 --> 03:23:16.740]  And I can understand how people become overwhelmed by this,
[03:23:16.740 --> 03:23:19.740]  but this is why it's so crucial to zero in
[03:23:19.740 --> 03:23:22.740]  on the actual problem here
[03:23:22.740 --> 03:23:25.740]  and to understand the nature of war.
[03:23:25.740 --> 03:23:27.740]  And it is war.
[03:23:27.740 --> 03:23:28.740]  It is.
[03:23:28.740 --> 03:23:31.740]  It's very important, and I know that Alex recently
[03:23:31.740 --> 03:23:34.740]  had General Flynn on here as well talking about this.
[03:23:34.740 --> 03:23:36.740]  You are at war.
[03:23:36.740 --> 03:23:39.740]  And I was recently, not recently, some time ago
[03:23:39.740 --> 03:23:41.740]  given advice by Dr. Pete Chambers,
[03:23:41.740 --> 03:23:45.740]  a former Green Beret surgeon,
[03:23:45.740 --> 03:23:48.740]  who said when you are at war,
[03:23:48.740 --> 03:23:51.740]  you have to consider the worst possible outcome
[03:23:51.740 --> 03:23:54.740]  and have contingency plans for all of that.
[03:23:54.740 --> 03:23:57.740]  And so it's really, really important that we do that,
[03:23:57.740 --> 03:24:00.740]  that we consider the worst possible outcome,
[03:24:00.740 --> 03:24:01.740]  understand the nature of this war,
[03:24:01.740 --> 03:24:04.740]  which is an attack on your freedom of communication,
[03:24:04.740 --> 03:24:06.740]  not just your freedom of speech,
[03:24:06.740 --> 03:24:09.740]  now your freedom of communication with this legislation.
[03:24:09.740 --> 03:24:10.740]  They're trying to make a self-censor
[03:24:10.740 --> 03:24:13.740]  where we don't even want to talk about the facts.
[03:24:13.740 --> 03:24:14.740]  This is Infowars.
[03:24:14.740 --> 03:24:17.740]  I don't need to tell you what repercussions
[03:24:17.740 --> 03:24:19.740]  platforms like Infowars have faced
[03:24:19.740 --> 03:24:21.740]  for just telling the truth.
[03:24:21.740 --> 03:24:26.740]  And people are making this shooting, for example,
[03:24:26.740 --> 03:24:29.740]  which is a tragedy, a tragedy.
[03:24:29.740 --> 03:24:31.740]  They're making it about the fact
[03:24:31.740 --> 03:24:35.740]  that this person is being misgendered in the media.
[03:24:35.740 --> 03:24:37.740]  I mean, we don't even offer our children
[03:24:37.740 --> 03:24:41.740]  the same sort of security that we offer banks.
[03:24:41.740 --> 03:24:43.740]  Banks have armed guards and security.
[03:24:43.740 --> 03:24:46.740]  And if you see the motorcade that's following Barack Obama
[03:24:46.740 --> 03:24:49.740]  around Australia these past few days, you'll be shocked.
[03:24:49.740 --> 03:24:51.740]  And yet when we talk about the important issues
[03:24:51.740 --> 03:24:52.740]  following this shooting,
[03:24:52.740 --> 03:24:54.740]  the mainstream media and people on Twitter
[03:24:54.740 --> 03:24:55.740]  are more concerned about the fact
[03:24:55.740 --> 03:24:56.740]  that they've been misgendered,
[03:24:56.740 --> 03:25:00.740]  rather than the fact that a shooter has killed
[03:25:00.740 --> 03:25:02.740]  innocent adults and children in cold blood.
[03:25:02.740 --> 03:25:06.740]  I mean, what sort of MK ultra madness is this?
[03:25:06.740 --> 03:25:09.740]  But let me tell you the biggest threat to their lies
[03:25:09.740 --> 03:25:10.740]  and their attacks is the truth.
[03:25:10.740 --> 03:25:12.740]  And it all boils down to this.
[03:25:12.740 --> 03:25:14.740]  Humanity is under attack.
[03:25:14.740 --> 03:25:15.740]  We are at war.
[03:25:15.740 --> 03:25:18.740]  Our health and our very lives are under attack.
[03:25:18.740 --> 03:25:21.740]  And perhaps the most egregious of these attacks
[03:25:21.740 --> 03:25:23.740]  is the attack on free thought.
[03:25:23.740 --> 03:25:25.740]  The devil wants to control our thought and our will
[03:25:25.740 --> 03:25:27.740]  and God gives us free will.
[03:25:27.740 --> 03:25:29.740]  And they can never take that away.
[03:25:29.740 --> 03:25:31.740]  We really are the defenders of free will.
[03:25:31.740 --> 03:25:33.740]  I want to hear what people have to say.
[03:25:33.740 --> 03:25:37.740]  We're going to go to Brad from, I think, Pennsylvania.
[03:25:37.740 --> 03:25:38.740]  Brad, you're on the air.
[03:25:38.740 --> 03:25:40.740]  Hey, Maria, thanks for taking my call.
[03:25:40.740 --> 03:25:42.740]  Yes, Pennsylvania is where I'm at.
[03:25:42.740 --> 03:25:45.740]  And can you tell me, repeat what legislation
[03:25:45.740 --> 03:25:47.740]  you're talking about exactly?
[03:25:47.740 --> 03:25:50.740]  This is, I don't know the exact name,
[03:25:50.740 --> 03:25:53.740]  but my understanding is this is the RESTRICT Act
[03:25:53.740 --> 03:25:56.740]  and this is what they're trying to implement
[03:25:56.740 --> 03:25:59.740]  under the guise of protecting people from TikTok
[03:25:59.740 --> 03:26:00.740]  and Chinese spies.
[03:26:00.740 --> 03:26:04.740]  But really what it is, is being able to
[03:26:04.740 --> 03:26:06.740]  restrict people's communication
[03:26:06.740 --> 03:26:08.740]  and criminalize them for their communication
[03:26:08.740 --> 03:26:10.740]  if they dare disagree with the government.
[03:26:10.740 --> 03:26:14.740]  And it'll be, you know, potentially pinned on them
[03:26:14.740 --> 03:26:16.740]  having, communicating with foreign adversaries
[03:26:16.740 --> 03:26:17.740]  and things of this nature.
[03:26:17.740 --> 03:26:20.740]  I mean, it's so dangerous.
[03:26:20.740 --> 03:26:24.740]  Yeah, you especially, it's especially sensitive to you,
[03:26:24.740 --> 03:26:27.740]  I'm sure, since the role you're playing in Australia
[03:26:27.740 --> 03:26:30.740]  and how strict Australia already is.
[03:26:30.740 --> 03:26:34.740]  I mean, you guys are one of the countries that are under,
[03:26:34.740 --> 03:26:37.740]  in my opinion, we're all under,
[03:26:37.740 --> 03:26:39.740]  we're all in the world government now.
[03:26:39.740 --> 03:26:41.740]  The United Nations is basically working behind the scenes
[03:26:41.740 --> 03:26:43.740]  as a world government.
[03:26:43.740 --> 03:26:45.740]  We just haven't been let in on the secret yet,
[03:26:45.740 --> 03:26:46.740]  all the countries.
[03:26:46.740 --> 03:26:48.740]  But that's why they took out Trump.
[03:26:48.740 --> 03:26:49.740]  That's why Macron wins,
[03:26:49.740 --> 03:26:51.740]  even though he probably wasn't elected.
[03:26:51.740 --> 03:26:53.740]  And Germany, that's how they elect their leaders.
[03:26:53.740 --> 03:26:55.740]  Even, they're selected.
[03:26:55.740 --> 03:26:57.740]  They're not, we're not electing these people.
[03:26:57.740 --> 03:26:59.740]  They're just, we're being told who won
[03:26:59.740 --> 03:27:00.740]  because we're under one world government.
[03:27:00.740 --> 03:27:01.740]  That's my opinion.
[03:27:01.740 --> 03:27:02.740]  And you're right.
[03:27:02.740 --> 03:27:05.740]  This is, the communication is going to be restricted next.
[03:27:05.740 --> 03:27:06.740]  And it's horrible.
[03:27:06.740 --> 03:27:07.740]  Right.
[03:27:07.740 --> 03:27:10.740]  It's Senate Bill 686, I believe.
[03:27:10.740 --> 03:27:12.740]  In the United States?
[03:27:12.740 --> 03:27:13.740]  Yes.
[03:27:13.740 --> 03:27:14.740]  Interesting.
[03:27:14.740 --> 03:27:15.740]  Yeah.
[03:27:15.740 --> 03:27:16.740]  And people don't pay enough attention to this legislation?
[03:27:16.740 --> 03:27:17.740]  The bill is being proposed.
[03:27:17.740 --> 03:27:18.740]  Correct.
[03:27:18.740 --> 03:27:21.740]  So the media frenzy is that we need to ban TikTok
[03:27:21.740 --> 03:27:23.740]  because it's dangerous to our youth.
[03:27:23.740 --> 03:27:26.740]  You know, it's something that's super virtuous.
[03:27:26.740 --> 03:27:31.740]  But in reality, the solution that's being proposed
[03:27:31.740 --> 03:27:34.740]  is something that could see regular people in prison
[03:27:34.740 --> 03:27:37.740]  for up to 20 years for disagreeing with the government.
[03:27:37.740 --> 03:27:38.740]  I mean, it's so insidious.
[03:27:38.740 --> 03:27:40.740]  And this is the nature of everything that they do.
[03:27:40.740 --> 03:27:41.740]  And you're right.
[03:27:41.740 --> 03:27:44.740]  It is the new world order government in full force,
[03:27:44.740 --> 03:27:47.740]  displaying to us that obey us or else.
[03:27:47.740 --> 03:27:50.740]  And so people do need to pay more attention.
[03:27:50.740 --> 03:27:53.740]  And regular people, and this is why I say, Brad,
[03:27:53.740 --> 03:27:55.740]  this is something that impacts regular people.
[03:27:55.740 --> 03:27:57.740]  We may not agree on the COVID injections.
[03:27:57.740 --> 03:28:00.740]  We may not agree on Bill Gates being a psychopath.
[03:28:00.740 --> 03:28:03.740]  But we surely, regardless of what part,
[03:28:03.740 --> 03:28:05.740]  what side of the political spectrum you're on,
[03:28:05.740 --> 03:28:08.740]  we would surely agree that imprisoning citizens
[03:28:08.740 --> 03:28:11.740]  for up to 20 years for having free thought
[03:28:11.740 --> 03:28:13.740]  is a danger to every single one of us.
[03:28:13.740 --> 03:28:15.740]  Amen, Maria.
[03:28:15.740 --> 03:28:16.740]  You're preaching to the choir.
[03:28:16.740 --> 03:28:19.740]  And thank you for your sense of urgency
[03:28:19.740 --> 03:28:21.740]  and pushing this information out there.
[03:28:21.740 --> 03:28:22.740]  You're exactly right.
[03:28:22.740 --> 03:28:24.740]  I mean, they're hitting us from so many different angles
[03:28:24.740 --> 03:28:27.740]  that it confuses everyone on a daily basis,
[03:28:27.740 --> 03:28:30.740]  which is why with this obfuscation
[03:28:30.740 --> 03:28:32.740]  and different tricks they pull
[03:28:32.740 --> 03:28:34.740]  that they're able to get this stuff passed.
[03:28:34.740 --> 03:28:36.740]  It's really evil.
[03:28:36.740 --> 03:28:39.740]  And thank you very much for pushing this out.
[03:28:39.740 --> 03:28:41.740]  You're absolutely right, Brad.
[03:28:41.740 --> 03:28:42.740]  Thank you so much for your call.
[03:28:42.740 --> 03:28:43.740]  We'll go to Al in Michigan.
[03:28:46.740 --> 03:28:48.740]  Al, you're on the air.
[03:28:52.740 --> 03:28:54.740]  Oh, we're going to break.
[03:28:54.740 --> 03:28:55.740]  We'll be right back with Al.

[03:29:20.740 --> 03:29:21.740]  It's turmeric concentrate

[03:29:56.740 --> 03:30:00.740]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[03:30:04.740 --> 03:30:05.740]  I want you all to know something.
[03:30:05.740 --> 03:30:07.740]  Alex Jones was right.
[03:30:07.740 --> 03:30:11.740]  Alex is right about far more than is wrong.
[03:30:11.740 --> 03:30:14.740]  Alex has been right on toward over a decade.
[03:30:14.740 --> 03:30:16.740]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it,
[03:30:16.740 --> 03:30:18.740]  flip it up or rub it down.
[03:30:18.740 --> 03:30:20.740]  Alex Jones was right.
[03:30:20.740 --> 03:30:22.740]  Think about how frustrated we are
[03:30:22.740 --> 03:30:24.740]  if you've been awake for a year or two.
[03:30:24.740 --> 03:30:26.740]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones
[03:30:26.740 --> 03:30:28.740]  or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[03:30:28.740 --> 03:30:32.740]  Alex Jones called this years ago, years ago.
[03:30:32.740 --> 03:30:34.740]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax,
[03:30:34.740 --> 03:30:36.740]  not for a second.
[03:30:36.740 --> 03:30:38.740]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[03:30:38.740 --> 03:30:41.740]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[03:30:41.740 --> 03:30:44.740]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[03:30:44.740 --> 03:30:46.740]  That's why the globalists hate me
[03:30:46.740 --> 03:30:49.740]  is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[03:30:56.740 --> 03:30:58.740]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book,
[03:30:58.740 --> 03:31:00.740]  The Great Reset in the War for the World,
[03:31:00.740 --> 03:31:02.740]  is a historic book that documents the globalists
[03:31:02.740 --> 03:31:03.740]  in their own words,
[03:31:03.740 --> 03:31:06.740]  plan for our future that is a hellish future.
[03:31:06.740 --> 03:31:09.740]  Now you'll be always, while they sell out books I guess,
[03:31:09.740 --> 03:31:10.740]  they're starting to ban them,
[03:31:10.740 --> 03:31:12.740]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset
[03:31:12.740 --> 03:31:13.740]  in the War for the World
[03:31:13.740 --> 03:31:16.740]  at bookstores, Amazon or Infowarswar.com.
[03:31:16.740 --> 03:31:18.740]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy
[03:31:18.740 --> 03:31:21.740]  of the book after the signed copies we got run out.
[03:31:21.740 --> 03:31:24.740]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[03:31:24.740 --> 03:31:26.740]  So get your copy of The Great Reset
[03:31:26.740 --> 03:31:27.740]  and The War for the World,
[03:31:27.740 --> 03:31:29.740]  a signed copy at Infowarswar.com.
[03:31:29.740 --> 03:31:32.740]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser
[03:31:32.740 --> 03:31:33.740]  to keep us on the air.
[03:31:33.740 --> 03:31:35.740]  So you won't just have this historic memento
[03:31:35.740 --> 03:31:36.740]  and this powerful book.
[03:31:36.740 --> 03:31:39.740]  You'll also know that you help keep Infowars on the air.
[03:31:39.740 --> 03:31:40.740]  I'm going to thank those of you that have gotten
[03:31:40.740 --> 03:31:43.740]  signed copies of the book or unsigned copies.
[03:31:43.740 --> 03:31:46.740]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet
[03:31:46.740 --> 03:31:48.740]  to go to Infowarswar.com and get a signed copy
[03:31:48.740 --> 03:31:50.740]  and buy a couple of unsigned copies
[03:31:50.740 --> 03:31:53.740]  and donate to the library or give them to the local school.
[03:31:53.740 --> 03:31:54.740]  This is an Infowar.
[03:31:54.740 --> 03:31:56.740]  I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[03:31:56.740 --> 03:31:58.740]  The fight against the New World Order
[03:31:58.740 --> 03:32:00.740]  is now the top story in the world.
[03:32:00.740 --> 03:32:01.740]  The globalists are in deep trouble,
[03:32:01.740 --> 03:32:03.740]  but they're striking back with all their
[03:32:03.740 --> 03:32:06.740]  deep state operatives to shut down Infowars
[03:32:06.740 --> 03:32:08.740]  and other truth tellers like James O'Keefe
[03:32:08.740 --> 03:32:10.740]  and Tucker Carlson and countless others.
[03:32:10.740 --> 03:32:12.740]  So please pray for us now more than ever.
[03:32:12.740 --> 03:32:14.740]  Spread the word about the broadcast
[03:32:14.740 --> 03:32:16.740]  and get great products to keep us on air
[03:32:16.740 --> 03:32:18.740]  and fund our operation while at the same time
[03:32:18.740 --> 03:32:19.740]  enriching your life.

[03:32:57.740 --> 03:32:59.740]  Leading a frontal assault
[03:32:59.740 --> 03:33:02.740]  to the lies of the new world order.
[03:33:02.740 --> 03:33:04.740]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:12.740 --> 03:33:13.740]  We have to go to break there.
[03:33:13.740 --> 03:33:14.740]  Al from Michigan.
[03:33:14.740 --> 03:33:15.740]  Thanks so much for holding.
[03:33:15.740 --> 03:33:16.740]  You're on the air.
[03:33:18.740 --> 03:33:20.740]  Hey, thanks for taking my call.
[03:33:21.740 --> 03:33:22.740]  You're very welcome.
[03:33:22.740 --> 03:33:23.740]  Please do go on.
[03:33:23.740 --> 03:33:29.740]  I wanted to explain who's behind this COVID scam
[03:33:29.740 --> 03:33:31.740]  and how it relates to Bible prophecy.
[03:33:32.740 --> 03:33:34.740]  It's none other than the Jesuit order
[03:33:34.740 --> 03:33:36.740]  and the Pope in Rome.
[03:33:36.740 --> 03:33:39.740]  Anthony Fauci was educated at Jesuit Regis High School
[03:33:39.740 --> 03:33:43.740]  and said his earliest mentors were Jesuit priests.
[03:33:43.740 --> 03:33:47.740]  He was then educated at Jesuit Holy Cross University.
[03:33:48.740 --> 03:33:51.740]  As I told Alex Jones, Hitler was a Jesuit
[03:33:51.740 --> 03:33:54.740]  and the Jesuits helped author Mein Kampf
[03:33:54.740 --> 03:33:58.740]  which was co-authored by Jesuit Bernard Steinfeld.
[03:33:59.740 --> 03:34:03.740]  In the Bible, Mystery Babylon of Revelation 17
[03:34:03.740 --> 03:34:06.740]  is described as a city on seven hills
[03:34:06.740 --> 03:34:09.740]  in Revelation 17 18
[03:34:09.740 --> 03:34:13.740]  and the woman which thou sawth is that great city
[03:34:13.740 --> 03:34:15.740]  which reigneth over the kings of the earth.
[03:34:16.740 --> 03:34:17.740]  So this is Rome.
[03:34:17.740 --> 03:34:19.740]  It's the harlot that rides the beast
[03:34:19.740 --> 03:34:23.740]  which is the Roman Empire, the fourth beast of Daniel
[03:34:23.740 --> 03:34:25.740]  and the beast of Revelation.
[03:34:26.740 --> 03:34:27.740]  So we know.
[03:34:27.740 --> 03:34:31.740]  Well, Al, I think that there are many many secret societies
[03:34:31.740 --> 03:34:34.740]  that have infiltrated sadly many aspects of the church.
[03:34:34.740 --> 03:34:35.740]  This is the thing.
[03:34:35.740 --> 03:34:38.740]  And so, you know, Catholics aren't the problem necessarily
[03:34:38.740 --> 03:34:40.740]  or this group isn't the problem necessarily
[03:34:40.740 --> 03:34:42.740]  but what we need to have is discernment
[03:34:42.740 --> 03:34:48.740]  and be aware of when certain aspects of Christianity
[03:34:48.740 --> 03:34:49.740]  have actually been targeted.
[03:34:49.740 --> 03:34:52.740]  I mean, who would you come after the most
[03:34:52.740 --> 03:34:53.740]  if you were the devil?
[03:34:56.740 --> 03:34:57.740]  Right.
[03:34:57.740 --> 03:34:58.740]  Well, this has been going on.
[03:34:58.740 --> 03:35:00.740]  Before the Jesuits, there was the Knights Templar
[03:35:00.740 --> 03:35:03.740]  who were suppressed for Baphomet worship
[03:35:03.740 --> 03:35:04.740]  and their banking monopoly.
[03:35:04.740 --> 03:35:06.740]  They were the first bankers
[03:35:06.740 --> 03:35:08.740]  and these Knights Templar, they went to Scotland
[03:35:08.740 --> 03:35:10.740]  and started Scottish-rate Freemasonry
[03:35:10.740 --> 03:35:12.740]  and they also went to Switzerland
[03:35:12.740 --> 03:35:15.740]  and that's why the Swiss flag is the Templar flag
[03:35:15.740 --> 03:35:18.740]  and you have all these corrupt Swiss bankers.
[03:35:18.740 --> 03:35:20.740]  The Swiss Guard also protects the place.
[03:35:21.740 --> 03:35:24.740]  I think that anyone who studies secret societies,
[03:35:24.740 --> 03:35:27.740]  I mean, if people haven't done that, you should
[03:35:27.740 --> 03:35:30.740]  just to understand that there is an infiltration
[03:35:30.740 --> 03:35:33.740]  of every single level of society by secret societies
[03:35:33.740 --> 03:35:36.740]  and I mean, we could talk about this all day, Al, really.
[03:35:36.740 --> 03:35:38.740]  I mean, there are so many of them
[03:35:38.740 --> 03:35:40.740]  but I appreciate you raising awareness on this
[03:35:40.740 --> 03:35:42.740]  because it's important for people to understand
[03:35:42.740 --> 03:35:44.740]  that there is a spiritual darkness behind this.
[03:35:44.740 --> 03:35:45.740]  I want to get to as many people as I can.
[03:35:45.740 --> 03:35:47.740]  I'm going to go to Andrew in New York
[03:35:47.740 --> 03:35:48.740]  who's been holding a while.
[03:35:48.740 --> 03:35:49.740]  Andrew, you're on the air.
[03:35:51.740 --> 03:35:53.740]  Yeah, you're right about the TikTok bill
[03:35:53.740 --> 03:35:58.740]  definitely does more damage than it does good
[03:35:59.740 --> 03:36:03.740]  but what I was going to say was about how the ESG,
[03:36:03.740 --> 03:36:06.740]  I call it the Extremely Stupid and Gay,
[03:36:07.740 --> 03:36:11.740]  it's basically environmentalism,
[03:36:11.740 --> 03:36:14.740]  like the fake stuff like carbon and stuff like that
[03:36:14.740 --> 03:36:18.740]  and so yeah, that kind of messes with the investments
[03:36:18.740 --> 03:36:20.740]  and that's kind of like they're deconstructionists
[03:36:20.740 --> 03:36:24.740]  and then eventually they want to get it
[03:36:24.740 --> 03:36:26.740]  so they have the CBDC.
[03:36:26.740 --> 03:36:29.740]  They're actually building a social credit system already,
[03:36:29.740 --> 03:36:32.740]  I guess like with like data mining and stuff they have.
[03:36:34.740 --> 03:36:37.740]  Yeah, you're right, Andrew, and here's the thing.
[03:36:37.740 --> 03:36:39.740]  This is the common ground that I'm talking about
[03:36:39.740 --> 03:36:42.740]  when we're actually having conversations with regular people
[03:36:42.740 --> 03:36:45.740]  who may not necessarily be up to date on the agenda
[03:36:45.740 --> 03:36:47.740]  behind the things that are happening,
[03:36:47.740 --> 03:36:49.740]  when you explain the control that's involved
[03:36:49.740 --> 03:36:54.740]  with things like ESG, the agenda behind the control,
[03:36:54.740 --> 03:36:58.740]  sorry, the agenda involved with, let me reword that,
[03:36:58.740 --> 03:37:00.740]  the agenda behind the social credit system,
[03:37:00.740 --> 03:37:02.740]  you know, everything that they're doing with digital ID
[03:37:02.740 --> 03:37:04.740]  and everything, when you explain that to regular people,
[03:37:04.740 --> 03:37:07.740]  it doesn't come off as conspiratorial
[03:37:07.740 --> 03:37:10.740]  because of the fact that it affects them as well.
[03:37:10.740 --> 03:37:11.740]  You know, when it came to the injections,
[03:37:11.740 --> 03:37:13.740]  people thought, oh, it's nuts to think that it would hurt me.
[03:37:13.740 --> 03:37:17.740]  You know, that's a problem out there over there for the crazies.
[03:37:17.740 --> 03:37:20.740]  But social credit system and privacy and data,
[03:37:20.740 --> 03:37:23.740]  these things actually do affect people as does the banking crisis.
[03:37:23.740 --> 03:37:26.740]  So really, really crucial point that you've raised there, Andrew,
[03:37:26.740 --> 03:37:28.740]  and I encourage people to talk about this with others
[03:37:28.740 --> 03:37:30.740]  when they're out there, regular people.
[03:37:30.740 --> 03:37:31.740]  I want to keep going.
[03:37:31.740 --> 03:37:33.740]  We've got Johnny from Denmark.
[03:37:33.740 --> 03:37:34.740]  Johnny, you're on the air.
[03:37:35.740 --> 03:37:37.740]  Hi, Maria. Great job you're doing.
[03:37:37.740 --> 03:37:40.740]  It's always a pleasure to listen to you hosting Infowars shows.
[03:37:40.740 --> 03:37:43.740]  And as so often happens, I call for one thing
[03:37:43.740 --> 03:37:47.740]  and then I listen to a caller and I want to get into another.
[03:37:47.740 --> 03:37:50.740]  Just very briefly addressing the point that a previous caller made
[03:37:50.740 --> 03:37:53.740]  about the Jesuits, I think he's only getting about one-third of the picture
[03:37:53.740 --> 03:37:55.740]  and not getting it quite right.
[03:37:55.740 --> 03:37:59.740]  I believe, very strongly based on my decades of research,
[03:37:59.740 --> 03:38:03.740]  that the apex of the New World Order are the Jesuits,
[03:38:03.740 --> 03:38:07.740]  but also the Rothschilds and the British royals.
[03:38:07.740 --> 03:38:10.740]  Just for example, if you want to go research this,
[03:38:10.740 --> 03:38:15.740]  the British monarch is actually the legal owner of all the land in the Commonwealth,
[03:38:15.740 --> 03:38:19.740]  and that means more than 18% of the world's land.
[03:38:19.740 --> 03:38:26.740]  Now, as far as the Knights Templar and their connection to the free nations,
[03:38:26.740 --> 03:38:31.740]  the Jesuits are responsible for a lot of disinformation about that, too.
[03:38:31.740 --> 03:38:36.740]  I believe that that caller did, that they were a force for evil and pro-NWO anti-humanity,
[03:38:36.740 --> 03:38:41.740]  but in researching the matter, I discovered that it's kind of like saying
[03:38:41.740 --> 03:38:44.740]  people who didn't know about the foundations of the U.S.
[03:38:44.740 --> 03:38:47.740]  and they see the U.S. now and they say,
[03:38:47.740 --> 03:38:50.740]  what a corrupt country, saying, oh yeah, the U.S. was founded on corruption.
[03:38:50.740 --> 03:38:53.740]  No, the free nations were not founded on corruption.
[03:38:53.740 --> 03:38:56.740]  They were founded as anti-NWO and they got infiltrated.
[03:38:56.740 --> 03:38:59.740]  But anyway, the thing I wanted to talk about was
[03:38:59.740 --> 03:39:03.740]  when I was on hold for Owen Schroyer's war room yesterday,
[03:39:03.740 --> 03:39:06.740]  he said to call in about three things, they're all pointing in the same direction,
[03:39:06.740 --> 03:39:09.740]  and that's NWO takeover of society.
[03:39:09.740 --> 03:39:17.740]  And they were the trans agenda and the shooting and Joe Biden's bumbling and fumbling.
[03:39:17.740 --> 03:39:21.740]  As far as the trans agenda leading to the decline of society,
[03:39:21.740 --> 03:39:25.740]  it's very interesting that one very intelligent, very knowledgeable researcher,
[03:39:25.740 --> 03:39:30.740]  Dr. Camille Paglia, who herself is transgender but on transitions,
[03:39:30.740 --> 03:39:36.740]  points out that societies that allow this invariably in history
[03:39:36.740 --> 03:39:39.740]  just collapse soon afterwards.
[03:39:39.740 --> 03:39:42.740]  As far as the shooting goes, there's a lot of gaslighting going on
[03:39:42.740 --> 03:39:48.740]  because if one reads the magnum opus on the subject,
[03:39:48.740 --> 03:39:52.740]  Dr. John R. Lott Jr.'s, More Guns, Less Crime,
[03:39:53.740 --> 03:39:57.740]  turns out that there is not one single case in history
[03:39:57.740 --> 03:40:00.740]  where increased gun control has led to decreased crime
[03:40:00.740 --> 03:40:04.740]  and in the vast majority of cases, it's led to increased crime.
[03:40:04.740 --> 03:40:06.740]  Yeah, you're absolutely right, Johnny.
[03:40:06.740 --> 03:40:09.740]  This is evidenced even by the fact that the Democrat states
[03:40:09.740 --> 03:40:13.740]  that are really tough on gun control have really high crime rates,
[03:40:13.740 --> 03:40:19.740]  but places like Bolsonaro legalises, gives more guns to his people and the crime goes down.
[03:40:19.740 --> 03:40:22.740]  I mean, we see trends like this all over the world.
[03:40:22.740 --> 03:40:24.740]  Johnny, I've got to get to more calls.
[03:40:24.740 --> 03:40:26.740]  Joshua from Colorado, you're on the air.
[03:40:28.740 --> 03:40:29.740]  Hi, can you hear me?
[03:40:30.740 --> 03:40:31.740]  Sure can.
[03:40:32.740 --> 03:40:33.740]  Thank you for taking my call.
[03:40:35.740 --> 03:40:37.740]  I just wanted to let you know,
[03:40:38.740 --> 03:40:44.740]  I want to let you know what the agenda is according to the free Masonic lodge, okay?
[03:40:44.740 --> 03:40:50.740]  I infiltrated masonry for almost 10 years and got all the way up to the 33rd degree
[03:40:50.740 --> 03:40:52.740]  and saw the four holy books.
[03:40:52.740 --> 03:40:55.740]  Let me tell you what they know is coming.
[03:40:55.740 --> 03:40:58.740]  This is only among the order of the Melchizedek,
[03:40:58.740 --> 03:41:01.740]  which are the 33rd and the 32nd degree basins.
[03:41:02.740 --> 03:41:05.740]  They know that once the economy falls,
[03:41:06.740 --> 03:41:10.740]  then World War III is going to happen and when the bombs drop,
[03:41:11.740 --> 03:41:14.740]  this thing called the Attack of the Shaddim,
[03:41:14.740 --> 03:41:18.740]  it's a prophecy in the Book of Baruch from the Dead Sea Scrolls,
[03:41:18.740 --> 03:41:24.740]  it's going to be this false alien invasion that is going to install the Antichrist,
[03:41:24.740 --> 03:41:26.740]  who they call Nikolai.
[03:41:26.740 --> 03:41:31.740]  And after that, they know that the whole purpose of the masons
[03:41:31.740 --> 03:41:36.740]  is to have the Holy Temple built by 2030 on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem.
[03:41:36.740 --> 03:41:40.740]  They know the timeline. They have to have it done by 2030.
[03:41:40.740 --> 03:41:43.740]  They've already got the materials for it, Joshua.
[03:41:43.740 --> 03:41:46.740]  They've already got the materials for it in Israel.
[03:41:46.740 --> 03:41:48.740]  They've been stockpiling for some time.
[03:41:48.740 --> 03:41:51.740]  Yes, and they have to have it done by 2030.
[03:41:51.740 --> 03:41:53.740]  That's the whole purpose of the masons.
[03:41:53.740 --> 03:41:57.740]  And they know that the way the Antichrist is going to come in
[03:41:57.740 --> 03:42:01.740]  is through a false alien invasion called the Attack of the Shaddim.
[03:42:01.740 --> 03:42:05.740]  This is a prophecy from the Book of Baruch from the Dead Sea Scrolls.
[03:42:05.740 --> 03:42:10.740]  And they also know that when the Antichrist, who they call Nikolai,
[03:42:10.740 --> 03:42:13.740]  has a seven-year reign,
[03:42:13.740 --> 03:42:18.740]  they also know that Yeshua and the race of who they call the Pleiadians,
[03:42:18.740 --> 03:42:22.740]  the ancient humanoids, who are on their mother ship called the New Jerusalem
[03:42:22.740 --> 03:42:25.740]  that is parked right in front of Venus,
[03:42:25.740 --> 03:42:30.740]  is going to come down with this big, the real alien invasion.
[03:42:30.740 --> 03:42:34.740]  There's this fleet called the Order of the Melchizedek
[03:42:34.740 --> 03:42:39.740]  that's going to come in with the mother ship, the New Jerusalem, by 2033.
[03:42:39.740 --> 03:42:42.740]  That is what the masons know.
[03:42:42.740 --> 03:42:45.740]  We've got to go to break now, but I encourage everyone.
[03:42:45.740 --> 03:42:47.740]  I just did an interview on this subject with Jay Dyer.
[03:42:47.740 --> 03:42:50.740]  It's up on zmedia.com. It'll be up on Band Later.
[03:42:50.740 --> 03:42:52.740]  Watch it because we talk about this very same thing.
[03:42:52.740 --> 03:42:54.740]  We'll be back right after this short break.
[03:42:57.740 --> 03:43:00.740]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new toothpaste
[03:43:00.740 --> 03:43:03.740]  that my dad, a retired dentist and oral surgeon, developed.
[03:43:04.740 --> 03:43:08.740]  Dr. Jones-Naturals' tumeric toothpaste that just came into stock.
[03:43:08.740 --> 03:43:11.740]  And I got to tell you, I got samples of this months ago and it is amazing.
[03:43:11.740 --> 03:43:15.740]  The way it makes your gums feel, what it does to your mouth, is insane.
[03:43:15.740 --> 03:43:18.740]  We know tumeric is an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory
[03:43:18.740 --> 03:43:20.740]  and does such great things for the body.
[03:43:20.740 --> 03:43:23.740]  Then you add that with tea tree oil and a bunch of other essential oils,
[03:43:23.740 --> 03:43:25.740]  it is just dynamite.
[03:43:25.740 --> 03:43:29.740]  It is so good to detox and attack inflammation in your mouth.
[03:43:29.740 --> 03:43:33.740]  I want to challenge everybody to try the new toothpaste at mfoolwarstor.com.
[03:43:33.740 --> 03:43:36.740]  Dr. Jones-Naturals' tumeric toothpaste.

[03:44:01.740 --> 03:44:03.740]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[03:44:03.740 --> 03:44:07.740]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[03:44:07.740 --> 03:44:12.740]  When we talk about the crew at info wars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[03:44:12.740 --> 03:44:16.740]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[03:44:16.740 --> 03:44:20.740]  And when we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Troyer and the hard work they engage in every day,
[03:44:20.740 --> 03:44:24.740]  five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[03:44:24.740 --> 03:44:28.740]  So for myself, the whole info wars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[03:44:28.740 --> 03:44:34.740]  I only encourage you now to realize that info wars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[03:44:34.740 --> 03:44:37.740]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[03:44:37.740 --> 03:44:41.740]  But most viewers and listeners never go to mfoolwarstor.com
[03:44:41.740 --> 03:44:44.740]  and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life,
[03:44:44.740 --> 03:44:46.740]  while at the same time keep us on air.
[03:44:46.740 --> 03:44:50.740]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at mfoolwarstor.com.
[03:44:50.740 --> 03:44:55.740]  If just 1% more of you took action at mfoolwarstor.com, our funding problems will be over.
[03:44:55.740 --> 03:44:56.740]  Please take action now.
[03:44:56.740 --> 03:45:00.740]  The fight against the new world order is now the top story in the world.
[03:45:00.740 --> 03:45:04.740]  The globalists are in deep trouble, but they're striking back with all their deep state operatives
[03:45:04.740 --> 03:45:10.740]  to shut down info wars and other truth tellers like James O'Keefe and Tucker Carlson and countless others.
[03:45:10.740 --> 03:45:14.740]  So please pray for us now more than ever, spread the word about the broadcast,
[03:45:14.740 --> 03:45:19.740]  and get great products to keep us on air and fund our operation while at the same time enriching your life.

[03:46:28.740 --> 03:46:30.740]  Cardiovascular, critical.

[03:46:47.740 --> 03:46:50.740]  And the last month I got a little busy so I didn't sign the books, we didn't have them for sale.
[03:46:50.740 --> 03:46:53.740]  But now, I sign the last books, you can get them right now.
[03:46:57.740 --> 03:47:03.740]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:08.740 --> 03:47:17.740]  Man, I am so energized when I talk to the free-thinking people of the world.
[03:47:17.740 --> 03:47:19.740]  This is just one of my favorite things to do.
[03:47:19.740 --> 03:47:21.740]  I'm going to go to Marcus from South Carolina.
[03:47:21.740 --> 03:47:24.740]  Thank you, Marcus, for holding you on the air.
[03:47:24.740 --> 03:47:26.740]  Thank you for taking my call.
[03:47:26.740 --> 03:47:34.740]  I'd like to point out, with all these big topic issues that we have, it makes a lot of people feel like, well, what can I do, what can I do?
[03:47:34.740 --> 03:47:41.740]  And the first step that everybody can do is take a look in the mirror and see what can you do better in your life.
[03:47:41.740 --> 03:47:44.740]  Can you talk to your neighbor? Can you form that little bit of community?
[03:47:44.740 --> 03:47:50.740]  Can you write a book? Can you get a product to help support some sort of front line, like Infowars?
[03:47:50.740 --> 03:48:02.740]  There's a lot of things like this that all of us can do, because at the end of the day, you have such big powers that be that they can make the big sweeping motions, but every one of us matters.
[03:48:02.740 --> 03:48:16.740]  Everything that we do actually matters, and that's why I just want to encourage everybody who's listening to go write a book, to get out there and say something to your friend, the neighbor, and just all in all, be better people and be the people who Jesus would want us to be.
[03:48:16.740 --> 03:48:30.740]  Amen, Marcus. Don't ever underestimate the power of even a small act. That small seed can change someone's life, and I always tell people that feel helpless, if you're a mother and you're part of a mother's group, do something within that group.
[03:48:30.740 --> 03:48:43.740]  Form those communities, get those community ties together really, really strong, because they want to separate the people, and every single one of those acts will lead to something good, because the law of sowing and reaping is that if you do good, good will come back to you.
[03:48:43.740 --> 03:48:51.740]  That is how the world works, so don't ever underestimate anything that you do. Thank you so much for the encouragement, Marcus. We're going to go to Charles in Georgia. Charles, you're on the air.
[03:48:51.740 --> 03:48:54.740]  Hey, how you doing, Maria?
[03:48:54.740 --> 03:48:56.740]  Doing well, Charles. How are you?
[03:48:56.740 --> 03:49:19.740]  I'm great. Hey, as usual, I highly enjoy your segment when you host, and I hope Alex and crew can keep the list of great female vibration and voices online, you know, such as yourself, Kate Dally, Leanne McAdoo, Christy Leigh, and Hannah Spears from Counter Spin, etc.
[03:49:20.740 --> 03:49:39.740]  Because, you know, I guess the world is more than 50% female, and sometimes we as males don't always, not that Alex is doing this, I'm saying, but we need to hear the female vibration as much as we do the males, in my opinion, but more prior to you, and it's always good to hear you.
[03:49:40.740 --> 03:50:07.740]  Now, my point, just very briefly, is when people that want to be free are fighting for liberation, it seems like when we wake up each day, one of the first things we should do, you know, we refresh ourselves, eat, shower, and all that stuff, but it seems like we should confess or express, do we really understand what the meaning of freedom and sovereignty is?
[03:50:07.740 --> 03:50:22.740]  And if we really know what it looks like relative to our food, health, finance, work, speech, travel, etc., then it seems like everything else should and would flow from there, but it's like shooting something with the buckshot, the scatters everywhere.
[03:50:23.740 --> 03:50:34.740]  If we don't resolve in our own spirit that we are designed to be independent and free so that our processes of manifesting that can come from there, what do you think?
[03:50:34.740 --> 03:50:55.740]  I agree with you, Charles. I think that everyone should know what their God-given right is, and my God-given right is that my God is God and not the government, and so it's very, very simple. Everything I do flows from that, everything I do flows from my faith, and I don't fear for my life, I don't fear for anything, because I know what to expect on the other side of this life, and God willing, I'll be worthy of that.
[03:50:56.740 --> 03:51:10.740]  So really, I don't live a life of fear because I recognize that my life is not my own, and it certainly doesn't belong to the government either. You're absolutely right, Charles. I want to go to Craig in California. Craig, you're on the air.
[03:51:11.740 --> 03:51:27.740]  You're doing an awesome job. It's Craig Treadwell here, last day's prophecy seminars and a full-time evangelist, former co-host of the end-time radio broadcast, but hey, real quick, I want to touch base with you about Revelation 13-18, where the Scripture says,
[03:51:27.740 --> 03:51:37.740]  Here's wisdom, let him that has understanding count the number of the beast, it's the number of a man, his number is six hundred, threescore and six, six hundred sixty-six.
[03:51:37.740 --> 03:51:52.740]  So that, my point is the Greek phrase for six hundred sixty-six, and I speak about this at churches all the time, and the Greek phrase is kisi, stigma, c-h-i-x-i, and stigma,
[03:51:52.740 --> 03:52:17.740]  and the word stigma is the last word for the last six, the word stigma, and it actually means to stick or to prick or to inject a mark incised or punched for recognition of ownership, and obviously the context is that the mark of the beast, people will not be able to buy or sell without this particular mark in the right hand or forehead.
[03:52:18.740 --> 03:52:25.740]  So it's obviously something injected, obviously we've been talking about microchips in the brain and all of this kind of stuff.
[03:52:25.740 --> 03:52:41.740]  Let's not forget, though, that I know you all have talked about it millions of times, including yourself and Alex, Profit Alex, but here's the deal, let's not forget that sociopath Bill Gates has the patent, I guess before he left Microsoft,
[03:52:41.740 --> 03:52:48.740]  he somehow secured the patent for cryptocurrency data mining in the human brain, I'm not a cryptocurrency expert.
[03:52:48.740 --> 03:53:06.740]  Yeah, Bill 06, sorry, patent 06-06-06 that is, Craig, and essentially the nanotechnology, what we've discovered is that the nanotechnology that's already inside the COVID-19 injections could make this possible, as well as sort of mirroring your brain neurons, hacking the human brain,
[03:53:06.740 --> 03:53:15.740]  and I find it absolutely fascinating that now we're talking about zombie viruses that can hack the human brain in line with what Yuval Noah Harari says, now what you're doing is giving a very real warning to people.
[03:53:15.740 --> 03:53:35.740]  I'm not saying that the COVID-19 injection was the mark, but the fact is that a mark will come eventually, and that could have very well been a test of compliance, but people, if they've had the shots, need to repent either way, I believe, and we should be in a state of trusting God more than we trust the world at all times.
[03:53:35.740 --> 03:53:43.740]  So, and never, ever let them do this to us again, never let them scare us into submission again, so, so crucial.
[03:53:43.740 --> 03:53:48.740]  We've got a very short time left, so I want to go to Glenn in Pennsylvania really quickly.
[03:53:48.740 --> 03:53:51.740]  Glenn, you're on the air, we've got a couple of minutes left here.
[03:53:51.740 --> 03:54:03.740]  Okay, Maria, thanks for having me. Just real quick, I came across an interesting video regarding Project Looking Glass as far as the elites using some type of ancient technology.
[03:54:03.740 --> 03:54:15.740]  Forgive me if I don't know the exact origins or its capabilities, but it's being used to look into the future, and they plug in different inputs to see what the outcome would be,
[03:54:15.740 --> 03:54:24.740]  and what they found was, as far back as 2012, that while using Looking Glass in addition to AI,
[03:54:24.740 --> 03:54:35.740]  all these quantum realms of possibilities come together into one singularity, and that singularity always ends up being a mass awakening.
[03:54:35.740 --> 03:54:47.740]  So, I think that brings some clarity why so many things are ramping up all at once towards the eradication of all the people that will be awake,
[03:54:47.740 --> 03:54:55.740]  to limit the number of people that can preserve history and move on because the globalists know that their time is up.
[03:54:56.740 --> 03:55:02.740]  Yeah, you're not wrong. I mean, the elimination of mankind is multifaceted.
[03:55:02.740 --> 03:55:12.740]  It is, number one, the fact that they want to reduce the world's population, and that's a given because less people, easier to control, but they also want to eliminate those of us who have the truth.
[03:55:12.740 --> 03:55:19.740]  Now, it's very interesting because in my conversations with Todd Callender, who I had on here as a guest recently,
[03:55:19.740 --> 03:55:27.740]  he talks about what he's found inside the patterns of some of these injections, but not only the injections, what's in our skies, in our foods, in the air.
[03:55:27.740 --> 03:55:36.740]  This is technology that can rewire your brain, be programmed to create illnesses at any given time.
[03:55:36.740 --> 03:55:45.740]  It's really Twilight Zone kind of stuff, but it is happening in the quantum realm, and that's something that I've been talking about for quite some time.
[03:55:45.740 --> 03:55:52.740]  You know, interviews with people like Dr. Anna Mejia, you can find all these on zmedia.com. They're not all on our banner on Band.
[03:55:52.740 --> 03:56:03.740]  So, you know, talking about the quantum physics side of things and how we're really moving into this Twilight Zone merge of technology and medicine,
[03:56:03.740 --> 03:56:11.740]  and this is why I think, you know, we're given a stark warning in the Bible that the deception in the last days will come through the pharmaceutical industry.
[03:56:11.740 --> 03:56:17.740]  People really need to be aware. So thank you, Glenn, for bringing that up, and thank you for your call.
[03:56:17.740 --> 03:56:27.740]  We're almost out of time here today, so I just really want to close by saying that the one thing that's evident from all of these callers today is that free thought.
[03:56:27.740 --> 03:56:33.740]  I mean, how much do you love hearing these different perspectives, even if you don't necessarily agree with them?
[03:56:33.740 --> 03:56:40.740]  The fact that people are able to do that and this platform provides for that is really beautiful to me.
[03:56:40.740 --> 03:56:49.740]  And be able to have conversations where we talk about these things and talk about how to better humanity and talk about bettering society.
[03:56:49.740 --> 03:56:56.740]  They don't want us to even have conversations about how to better society. They want to be able to tell us how they're going to better society.
[03:56:56.740 --> 03:57:06.740]  And their values are just really out there. I mean, we're talking about protecting people that sexualize children and demonizing people that dare protect children.
[03:57:06.740 --> 03:57:11.740]  It's just an upside-down world, but this is the satanic inversion that we are seeing in full force.
[03:57:11.740 --> 03:57:18.740]  I'm really sorry for the callers that I couldn't get to today. I'll do this again another time that I'm on.
[03:57:18.740 --> 03:57:25.740]  I really do appreciate the time that everyone took to call in, and I appreciate every single person in this world fighting for freedom.
[03:57:25.740 --> 03:57:29.740]  I encourage everyone, go to zmedia.com or later today. It'll be up on Band.
[03:57:29.740 --> 03:57:35.740]  You all know Jay Dyer. He regularly hosts The 4th Hour, a really important interview on Project Bluebeam and the coming deception.
[03:57:35.740 --> 03:57:42.740]  Thank you to everyone for tuning in today. God bless you, and thank you for your support of InfoWars and independent media.
[03:58:06.740 --> 03:58:09.740]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[03:58:09.740 --> 03:58:10.740]  This is reality.
[03:58:10.740 --> 03:58:12.740]  It just pancakes.
[03:58:12.740 --> 03:58:14.740]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[03:58:14.740 --> 03:58:19.740]  The revolution of peaceful information is coming, and when it comes time, you people are going to be brought into punishment.
[03:58:19.740 --> 03:58:21.740]  You're lying to the public. It's disgusting.
[03:58:21.740 --> 03:58:25.740]  The media continues to misrepresent what I've said.
[03:58:25.740 --> 03:58:28.740]  He may be America's best known conspiracy theorist.
[03:58:28.740 --> 03:58:36.740]  Alex Jones has the largest audience in the country, bigger than any of the networks, the biggest megaphone in the country.
[03:58:36.740 --> 03:58:40.740]  We're going to get fired up about the real things, the things that matter!
[03:58:44.740 --> 03:58:46.740]  Burn in hell, New World Order.
[03:58:46.740 --> 03:58:50.740]  InfoWars. Tomorrow's news today.
[03:58:50.740 --> 03:58:52.740]  This is their big move.
[03:58:52.740 --> 03:58:55.740]  So, yeah, you say, why doesn't Biden address the disasters in the United States?
[03:58:55.740 --> 03:58:58.740]  He doesn't care. That's not his job.
[03:58:58.740 --> 03:59:00.740]  He's not the president of the United States.
[03:59:00.740 --> 03:59:03.740]  He's a puppet operating for the globalists.
[03:59:03.740 --> 03:59:08.740]  Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased.
[03:59:08.740 --> 03:59:10.740]  They must be opposed.
[03:59:10.740 --> 03:59:13.740]  Autocrats only understand one word.
[03:59:13.740 --> 03:59:16.740]  No. No. No.
[03:59:16.740 --> 03:59:17.740]  Exactly.
[03:59:17.740 --> 03:59:20.740]  And that's why we say no to your vaccines.
[03:59:20.740 --> 03:59:24.740]  We say no to you shutting down our businesses.
[03:59:24.740 --> 03:59:26.740]  We say no to you taking our firearms.
[03:59:26.740 --> 03:59:29.740]  We say no to you censoring our free speech.
[03:59:29.740 --> 03:59:32.740]  We say no to you selling us out to the World Health Organization.
[03:59:32.740 --> 03:59:35.740]  We say no to you getting us into World War Three.
[03:59:35.740 --> 03:59:36.740]  You're right.
[03:59:36.740 --> 03:59:40.740]  We stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden, and we say no.
[03:59:40.740 --> 03:59:42.740]  And we say no to your war.
[03:59:49.740 --> 03:59:53.740]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
