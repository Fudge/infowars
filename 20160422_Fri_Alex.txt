[00:00:12.848 --> 00:00:24.613]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.613 --> 00:00:37.379]  I'm sure it's a coincidence that Earth Day is Vladimir Lenin's birthday.
[00:00:39.093 --> 00:00:49.217]  And I'm sure it's a coincidence that May Day is the big communist celebration day, and it's also one of the high occultic days in Europe.
[00:00:49.217 --> 00:00:51.198]  Of course, none of it is a coincidence.
[00:00:51.198 --> 00:01:06.885]  If you know real history, undisputed real history, it is the Jacobin movement of the Bavarian Illuminati that took over France later, that has established everything we're now basically living under.
[00:01:07.921 --> 00:01:11.982]  It is the counter, counterfeit Renaissance.
[00:01:11.982 --> 00:01:14.643]  It is the counter to the Enlightenment.
[00:01:14.643 --> 00:01:18.405]  It's the New Dark Age.
[00:01:18.405 --> 00:01:22.046]  Packaged as the Enlightenment, just so everybody knows.
[00:01:22.046 --> 00:01:27.028]  And we've got Mark Moreno of Climate Depot, congressional advisor, you name it, joining us.
[00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.430]  To break all this down, we may have the founder of the Weather Channel on today as well.
[00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:39.613]  He's been on before to talk about it here on Earth Day and some of the latest anti-human initiatives that are being carried out by these people.
[00:01:39.613 --> 00:01:45.294]  And then we also have ManCow contacted, I guess, Nico, my producer, this morning.
[00:01:45.294 --> 00:01:49.196]  I was wanting to get him on next week for a full hour to talk about the election.
[00:01:49.196 --> 00:01:52.797]  Syndicated radio host, Discovery Channel TV host, everybody knows ManCow.
[00:01:52.797 --> 00:01:53.277]  Smart guy.
[00:01:54.711 --> 00:01:58.494]  And he called Nico back this morning and said, well, let me pop in for 10 minutes this week and an hour next week.
[00:01:58.494 --> 00:02:02.537]  I want to talk about Prince, who I know was a frequent guest on his show, but I didn't know.
[00:02:02.537 --> 00:02:07.661]  I guess Mankow had told me that Prince was a listener of the show and had actually talked about the broadcast.
[00:02:07.661 --> 00:02:10.263]  And it's not about, oh, we got talked about by Prince.
[00:02:10.263 --> 00:02:12.624]  Oh, wow, we're so big.
[00:02:12.624 --> 00:02:20.130]  It's that I don't really know any artist or celebrity that is off the reservation that isn't a listener.
[00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.211]  I mean, why wouldn't they be?
[00:02:24.082 --> 00:02:34.225]  It just shows the solidarity out there when you know a Kurt Russell knows what's going on, or a Jeff Bridges, or an artist like Prince.
[00:02:34.225 --> 00:02:37.186]  But I mean, it was obvious Prince knew what was going on.
[00:02:37.186 --> 00:02:46.048]  Years ago, he'd go on TV and talk about world government, the private Federal Reserve, we're all slaves, New World Order, geoengineering, chemtrailing.
[00:02:47.944 --> 00:03:00.450]  By the way, Merle Haggard also just died a few weeks ago, as you know, and he complained about chemtrails and thought, it turns out, he had actually sold newspapers that he thought it was giving him, he and others, respiratory problems.
[00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.331]  And by the way, both of them were having respiratory problems.
[00:03:02.331 --> 00:03:03.732]  They thought he first had died of the flu.
[00:03:03.732 --> 00:03:08.154]  The other thing could have been an overdose on medication he was taking for the flu and some other mystery illness.
[00:03:08.154 --> 00:03:10.215]  But regardless, obviously, it
[00:03:11.704 --> 00:03:16.206]  It's a low probability that geoengineering chemicals outright kill these two guys.
[00:03:16.206 --> 00:03:24.111]  But it's killing plant life, it's hurting the earth, it's leading to all sorts of problems with people's lungs.
[00:03:24.111 --> 00:03:25.932]  I mean, that's coming out in the news.
[00:03:25.932 --> 00:03:30.094]  And then mainstream media acts like we're crazy and says there's no chemtrailing going on.
[00:03:30.094 --> 00:03:33.476]  And they go, silly, that's ice crystals.
[00:03:33.476 --> 00:03:34.236]  Yeah, I know.
[00:03:34.236 --> 00:03:36.818]  And you only get condensation trails in the winter.
[00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:40.541]  Generally, anywhere below 10,000 feet.
[00:03:40.541 --> 00:03:43.644]  In the summer, it's got to be up 20,000-30,000 feet.
[00:03:43.644 --> 00:03:55.995]  I see jets fly over at 5,000-10,000 feet in July and leave these big trails that sit there for an hour and then expand into this rainbow chemical haze.
[00:03:55.995 --> 00:03:58.357]  And then I've got thousands of patents, thousands,
[00:04:00.998 --> 00:04:20.950]  And they gave a guy a Nobel Prize in 92, you can look this up, forget his name, some top scientist, meteorologist, who proposed adding barium salts, aluminum dioxide to the jet fuel, and that it would then be aerosolized and turned into particula through the jet engine.
[00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.793]  So, the airlines, except for the top executives, don't even know about this.
[00:04:24.793 --> 00:04:28.475]  It's done by government mandate, like putting fluoride in the water.
[00:04:29.938 --> 00:04:33.741]  Or, in the old days, when they cared about us, iodine and salt.
[00:04:33.741 --> 00:04:38.204]  It's going on, and it's multifaceted, and they admit they're doing it.
[00:04:38.204 --> 00:04:41.987]  They just say the details are secret.
[00:04:41.987 --> 00:04:49.773]  I mean, in 1979, a global treaty was signed, including by the U.S., to limit weather weapons and aerosol spraying.
[00:04:49.773 --> 00:04:52.235]  It's going on, okay?
[00:04:52.235 --> 00:04:56.218]  And the point is, Prince and Merle Haggard were worried about it, so we should bring it up.
[00:04:59.167 --> 00:05:06.570]  A recent story by the Financial Times confirms that Daesh, also known as the Islamic State, was created in part by the Saudis.
[00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:13.432]  According to the late Saudi Foreign Minister, Islamic State was cobbled together in response to the Shia government in Iraq following the U.S.
[00:05:13.432 --> 00:05:16.353]  invasion of the country and the execution of Saddam Hussein.
[00:05:16.513 --> 00:05:25.220]  The story ignores the fact the Saudis collaborated with the CIA and Pakistani intelligence to create the Afghan Arabs, which would become Al-Qaeda.
[00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:32.246]  Other factions of the CIA organized and Saudi-funded Mujahideen coalesced into another fanatical Wahhabi group, the Taliban.
[00:05:32.246 --> 00:05:38.612]  In 2006, Al-Qaeda and Iraq merged with several other Sunni Wahhabi groups to form the Islamic State of Iraq.
[00:05:38.612 --> 00:05:40.373]  When the group moved into Syria in 2013, it became ISIS.
[00:05:42.475 --> 00:05:49.624]  The missing 28 pages will allegedly show Saudi complicity in the 9-11 attacks, but it will not show the role played by the CIA.
[00:05:49.624 --> 00:05:54.911]  The same can be said for the role played by the CIA and the Pentagon in the creation of terrorist groups.
[00:05:54.911 --> 00:05:57.213]  Read more right now at InfoWars.com
[00:05:58.629 --> 00:05:59.570]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:00.130]  Good, brother.
[00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:01.872]  Just recently started using your products.
[00:06:01.872 --> 00:06:03.813]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[00:06:03.813 --> 00:06:07.837]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[00:06:07.837 --> 00:06:10.459]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[00:06:10.459 --> 00:06:12.881]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[00:06:12.881 --> 00:06:20.688]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:06:21.048 --> 00:06:29.878]  We do the super male and the super female vitality big changes a lot of energy We've gotten off to the cheap energy drinks energy shots saving a ton of money.
[00:06:29.878 --> 00:06:35.325]  They're sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then
[00:06:35.745 --> 00:06:38.367]  Concentrated or maximum potency.
[00:06:38.367 --> 00:06:50.378]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while But then burn you out in my experience where a stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source So it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[00:06:50.378 --> 00:06:57.324]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life
[00:06:58.638 --> 00:07:09.183]  You're investing in your health and supporting the InfoWar when you visit InfoWarsLife.com and purchase your supply of Survival Shield X2 Nation Iodine and all the great products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:07:09.183 --> 00:07:15.106]  As you know, we've talked to pharmacists, chemists, doctors, researchers, scientists, and the answer is clear.
[00:07:15.106 --> 00:07:17.167]  Iodine is key, is paramount.
[00:07:17.287 --> 00:07:22.330]  And there's still so much new information coming out that we simply can't even keep up with it.
[00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:31.275]  In our quest for the purest iodine, we drill down more than 7,000 feet to gather these purple-blue crystals to extract the ultra-pure iodine.
[00:07:31.275 --> 00:07:35.178]  On top of that, we also screen our iodine for radiation before bottling.
[00:07:35.178 --> 00:07:38.020]  It is the purest, cleanest, strongest out there.
[00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:42.062]  Quite frankly, I'm flattered that with the launch of survival shield nascent iodine,
[00:07:42.222 --> 00:07:43.003]  We're good to go.
[00:08:01.568 --> 00:08:11.074]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[00:08:11.074 --> 00:08:12.636]  Thomas Jefferson.
[00:08:12.636 --> 00:08:19.260]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:25.324]  Weeks flash by like the twinkle in your child's eye.
[00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:30.901]  It's Friday, the 22nd day of April 2016.
[00:08:30.901 --> 00:08:33.802]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:08:33.802 --> 00:08:36.263]  We'll be here for the next four hours.
[00:08:36.263 --> 00:08:37.763]  As we are weekdays, 11 a.m.
[00:08:37.763 --> 00:08:38.404]  to 3 p.m.
[00:08:38.404 --> 00:08:41.825]  Central Standard Time.
[00:08:41.825 --> 00:08:45.666]  Then I will return live in studio this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:08:45.666 --> 00:08:49.707]  Central.
[00:08:49.707 --> 00:08:54.288]  There is so much, again, incredibly important news today that I want to break down.
[00:08:54.288 --> 00:08:55.469]  We will be covering Earth Day.
[00:08:56.365 --> 00:09:10.710]  that has been established as a world government anti-human eugenics holiday by the UN, celebrating of course Vladimir Lenin's birthday of the same date.
[00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:14.551]  We will be looking at that with Mark Moreno today and a lot more.
[00:09:14.551 --> 00:09:18.413]  Also, did the chemtrail flu kill Prince and Merle Haggard?
[00:09:18.413 --> 00:09:20.593]  We asked that question yesterday.
[00:09:20.593 --> 00:09:21.974]  We're going to go through it because both men
[00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:37.149]  We're concerned about respiratory issues dealing with the consistent, ongoing geoengineering programs using aluminum dioxide, barium salts, and then other radioactive isotopes.
[00:09:37.149 --> 00:09:39.451]  And that's declassified that's going on.
[00:09:39.451 --> 00:09:42.613]  The specifics are still secret.
[00:09:42.613 --> 00:09:48.877]  And they have lots of folks on Infowars.com in our article making fun of me saying, those are ice crystals, Alex.
[00:09:48.877 --> 00:09:51.599]  Yes, I know that aircraft up at a certain altitude
[00:09:52.884 --> 00:10:04.387]  That the leading edge of the wings goes through the atmosphere and creates nuclei, or concentrates water vapor, and then that freezes.
[00:10:04.387 --> 00:10:08.848]  And then the ice crystals disappear in about 30 seconds to a minute.
[00:10:08.848 --> 00:10:14.770]  When I was about two years old, one of my earliest memories is my father describing what those lines in the sky were.
[00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:15.710]  Starting in the early 90s,
[00:10:17.793 --> 00:10:23.238]  They began to stay in the air for hours and form giant cloud banks.
[00:10:23.238 --> 00:10:28.723]  And NASA came out and said, the Earth is 20% darker about 16 years ago.
[00:10:28.723 --> 00:10:30.464]  Then they said it's 30% darker.
[00:10:30.464 --> 00:10:36.129]  And they said persistent condensation trails are dimming the Earth.
[00:10:36.129 --> 00:10:37.110]  That's BBC.
[00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:41.254]  I mean, just type in.
[00:10:41.254 --> 00:10:43.216]  Jet travel is making atmosphere darker.
[00:10:44.474 --> 00:10:50.736]  And it's artificial pollution added to the jet fuel, aerosolized through the jet engines.
[00:10:50.736 --> 00:10:52.317]  And we have the patents.
[00:10:52.317 --> 00:11:00.600]  There are hundreds on how to put it through the engines and how to have the fuel work better with the additives.
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:11.224]  And the secret government subsidy programs that are admitted to be $5 billion a year to the Department of Energy alone for the fuel additive.
[00:11:12.777 --> 00:11:17.720]  Five billion dollars in one program of spray cost.
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:22.783]  Just like we knew there was nothing secret.
[00:11:22.783 --> 00:11:24.024]  Oh, Smithsonian.com.
[00:11:24.024 --> 00:11:28.687]  Oh, airplane contrails may be creating accidental geoengineering.
[00:11:28.687 --> 00:11:30.748]  That was last year.
[00:11:30.748 --> 00:11:39.893]  Ladies and gentlemen, the Council on Foreign Relations came out six years ago and admitted they're chemtrailing everybody and said it's for your own good.
[00:11:39.893 --> 00:11:40.394]  Shut up.
[00:11:41.431 --> 00:11:48.353]  Three years ago they came out with a headline, why we need Al-Qaeda in Syria and how good Al-Qaeda is.
[00:11:48.353 --> 00:11:50.674]  The military didn't go along with this, they changed the name to ISIS.
[00:11:50.674 --> 00:11:53.335]  You're like, what's that have to do with Kim trailing?
[00:11:53.335 --> 00:11:54.455]  They play these games.
[00:11:54.455 --> 00:11:59.537]  They've got programs much bigger than the Manhattan Project going on all over the place.
[00:11:59.537 --> 00:12:04.819]  Just what we know of is so freakish, I can't even believe it.
[00:12:04.819 --> 00:12:10.681]  And then I cut special reports showing scores of mainstream articles now admitting they're spraying us.
[00:12:12.591 --> 00:12:19.214]  High school textbooks admit they're adding it to jet fuel, and that they're, quote, saving the earth from global warming with it, because they know they got the younger generation.
[00:12:19.214 --> 00:12:22.876]  But to the older one, they go, oh, that doesn't exist.
[00:12:22.876 --> 00:12:28.899]  Just like Obamacare doesn't have death panels and doesn't increase your prices, and of course now they admit it does.
[00:12:28.899 --> 00:12:31.440]  It's all just screw jobs.
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.682]  So we're going to play that Prince clip coming up.
[00:12:33.682 --> 00:12:40.565]  There's a couple of them where he talked about geoengineering and chemtrails and the Federal Reserve and all the rest of it.
[00:12:44.713 --> 00:12:46.557]  I talked about this yesterday within hours.
[00:12:46.557 --> 00:12:52.612]  There are a bunch of mainstream news articles making fun of me going, Alex Jones claims Prince thought this and Prince thought that.
[00:12:52.612 --> 00:12:54.516]  All I was doing was pointing out what he already said.
[00:12:56.817 --> 00:13:03.259]  But they didn't want people that were fans of him, because he had so many hundreds of millions of fans around the world, to actually look into what he discussed.
[00:13:03.259 --> 00:13:04.880]  So they just say it isn't true.
[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:06.260]  That's how they deceive.
[00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.101]  Kind of like Ted Cruz going, I'm winning the popular vote.
[00:13:09.101 --> 00:13:10.282]  Democracy is spoken.
[00:13:10.282 --> 00:13:11.382]  I am winning.
[00:13:11.382 --> 00:13:13.383]  People voted in Colorado.
[00:13:13.383 --> 00:13:15.284]  People voted in all these states.
[00:13:15.284 --> 00:13:15.664]  I won 100%.
[00:13:18.177 --> 00:13:19.638]  Finally Sean Hannity goes, no you didn't.
[00:13:19.638 --> 00:13:20.858]  Stop saying that.
[00:13:20.858 --> 00:13:23.019]  My audience isn't buying it.
[00:13:23.019 --> 00:13:25.640]  And Hannity's kind of saying, man, you're on all the time.
[00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:26.821]  I've had you on more than anybody.
[00:13:26.821 --> 00:13:28.601]  He goes, I like you, but stop it.
[00:13:28.601 --> 00:13:31.142]  My audience is getting really mad.
[00:13:31.142 --> 00:13:34.304]  He's telling him, Cruz, it ain't selling.
[00:13:34.304 --> 00:13:34.724]  Stop it.
[00:13:37.301 --> 00:13:39.883]  That's the level of craziness that this has now reached.
[00:13:39.883 --> 00:13:41.225]  Can you believe that Kook, Matt Drudge?
[00:13:41.225 --> 00:13:43.507]  Yeah, he said we should have voters in elections.
[00:13:43.507 --> 00:13:44.367]  Oh, yeah.
[00:13:44.367 --> 00:13:50.393]  But you notice that sales job in the last three weeks didn't work, so now the media is backtracking.
[00:13:50.393 --> 00:13:56.659]  Well, Rince Previs, I have the clip, went on TV last night and actually said, oh, it doesn't matter now that he's going to get the 237.
[00:13:58.675 --> 00:14:09.461]  Or the 1,237 delegates he needs to not be able to be blocked or to have a second vote on the delegates?
[00:14:09.461 --> 00:14:13.343]  We're just going to change the rules anyways!
[00:14:13.343 --> 00:14:19.346]  And he sits there with that con artist grin on his face going, of course you don't vote!
[00:14:19.346 --> 00:14:20.607]  What, you think this is a free country?
[00:14:22.312 --> 00:14:29.141]  That's why I make the joke that soon they'll say, conspiracy theorists claim that women once breastfed or gave vaginal birth.
[00:14:29.141 --> 00:14:39.316]  But it's almost getting to that point now where we sent bigs out on the street yesterday, we're going to play this, and talk to people about
[00:14:40.646 --> 00:14:52.553]  Getting rid of genders in bathrooms, so men can go in women's bathrooms and vice versa, and how undoubtedly perverts, there's always been a big pervert problem, you know, with a small minority of folks going into women's bathrooms and perving out.
[00:14:52.553 --> 00:14:54.834]  That's well known.
[00:14:54.834 --> 00:14:57.435]  They have stationed cops outside some areas where they start doing it.
[00:14:57.435 --> 00:14:59.176]  I mean, it's in the news.
[00:14:59.176 --> 00:15:00.937]  Now they can legally do it.
[00:15:00.937 --> 00:15:07.581]  So your new right is to be a perv, and people are telling bigs, hey man, get with the program!
[00:15:07.581 --> 00:15:07.901]  It's 2016, buddy!
[00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:13.651]  We're told what to eat by Michelle Obama.
[00:15:13.651 --> 00:15:16.592]  We're told how to speak by the media.
[00:15:16.592 --> 00:15:21.313]  We're being taught how to be good little slaves, so that's coming up.
[00:15:21.313 --> 00:15:31.356]  And Chelsea Clinton, the video's on Infowars.com, says gun control opportunity on Supreme Court with Scalia gone.
[00:15:31.356 --> 00:15:32.156]  That's right.
[00:15:32.156 --> 00:15:36.197]  Now that Scalia's gone, we can enact gun control.
[00:15:36.197 --> 00:15:39.538]  And see, my brain doesn't just look at one article and then not connect the dots.
[00:15:42.901 --> 00:15:49.366]  You know they announced within hours of Prince being found dead yesterday that they would do a full autopsy.
[00:15:49.366 --> 00:16:09.803]  But with Antonin Scalia, the one man holding back open borders, gun confiscation, world government, WTO control of our country, UNESCO control, UN offices being set up in every major city to control local government in strong cities initiative, Schwarzenegger quarterbacking it,
[00:16:14.056 --> 00:16:15.878]  He didn't get an autopsy.
[00:16:15.878 --> 00:16:31.157]  And then we had reporters on this show, like Wayne Madsen and Joe Biggs and others, so smart, so tuned in, so dialed into their sixth sense, that they both came on and said, this looks like Bohemian Grove meets The Shining.
[00:16:31.157 --> 00:16:32.299]  We smell Dick Cheney.
[00:16:33.772 --> 00:16:45.537]  We think this is a secret society operation, and then a month later, the Washington Post admitted that they're doing secret society rituals as a spinoff of Bohemian Grove there.
[00:16:45.537 --> 00:16:51.139]  Now, you want to talk about reporters that are smart.
[00:16:51.139 --> 00:16:52.020]  But see, here's the deal.
[00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:53.400]  We're on their tail.
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:54.321]  This is what we do.
[00:16:57.042 --> 00:16:58.523]  We understand what we're facing.
[00:16:58.523 --> 00:17:08.650]  I mean, they had paintings and sculptures of the devil eating small children and devil masks by the hundreds everywhere.
[00:17:08.650 --> 00:17:10.171]  Voodoo stuff, folks.
[00:17:10.171 --> 00:17:13.734]  Not Day of the Dead stuff, not Halloween stuff.
[00:17:13.734 --> 00:17:18.898]  They had hardcore voodoo, Santeria stuff everywhere.
[00:17:18.898 --> 00:17:22.881]  And images of little children being murdered, being eaten by demons.
[00:17:22.881 --> 00:17:25.282]  And we're like, whoa, this is like Secret Society.
[00:17:25.282 --> 00:17:25.903]  This is satanic.
[00:17:26.721 --> 00:17:41.087]  So I guess, I mean, in a way, I'm saying they're savvy, but it's right in your face, but they said, like Bohemian Grove, boom, boom, boom, boom, Bohemian Grove satellite, boom, run by black ops, boom, right as usual.
[00:17:41.087 --> 00:17:48.671]  Geopolitical world government books everywhere by Zbigniew Brzezinski, David Rockefeller, you name it.
[00:17:48.671 --> 00:17:53.213]  No autopsy for Antonin Scalia, but for Prince, there'll be an autopsy.
[00:17:56.567 --> 00:17:57.447]  Nothing to see here.
[00:17:57.447 --> 00:18:01.348]  Move along, move along, move along.
[00:18:01.348 --> 00:18:04.049]  So that's just some of what we're going to be breaking down here on Earth Day.
[00:18:04.049 --> 00:18:05.209]  Mark Morano's going to be joining us.
[00:18:05.209 --> 00:18:12.190]  Mancow's popping in at the bottom of the hour because he was friends with Prince, both of the few radio shows that Prince would go on.
[00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:17.132]  And he wants to come on and talk about the fact that Prince was aware of the New World Order and would talk about it on Mancow's show.
[00:18:17.132 --> 00:18:22.933]  And Mancow's trying to dig around to find, it's hard when you've got all these hour-long interviews, you know, to find right where they're saying it, but it's interesting.
[00:18:23.999 --> 00:18:29.704]  I wish I'd answered the phone a few months ago when Man Cow and Jeff Bridges called me up.
[00:18:29.704 --> 00:18:31.225]  Jeff Bridges wanted to talk.
[00:18:31.225 --> 00:18:33.266]  I still haven't even gotten around to trying to call Bridges.
[00:18:33.266 --> 00:18:34.007]  I'm going to do it.
[00:18:34.007 --> 00:18:37.490]  I almost feel like a psychological block to never call celebrities.
[00:18:39.309 --> 00:18:39.809]  It's weird.
[00:18:39.809 --> 00:18:46.634]  It's just, I just, I mean, because if celebrities are awake to the new world order, then they can be very, very useful, and they know that, towards waking people up.
[00:18:46.634 --> 00:18:50.436]  I mean, I love Kurt Russell, but I don't just like somebody because they're a celebrity.
[00:18:50.436 --> 00:18:51.897]  I mean, I have to like them.
[00:18:51.897 --> 00:18:53.138]  I have to like their acting.
[00:18:53.138 --> 00:18:53.959]  Love Kurt Russell.
[00:18:53.959 --> 00:18:54.879]  Love the dude.
[00:18:54.879 --> 00:18:56.660]  Love Jeff Bridges.
[00:18:56.660 --> 00:19:00.423]  Love Bruce Willis.
[00:19:00.423 --> 00:19:01.964]  And it turns out they're all listeners.
[00:19:01.964 --> 00:19:03.765]  It's really cool.
[00:19:03.765 --> 00:19:04.966]  It's like everybody I like
[00:19:06.124 --> 00:19:11.416]  Things like me and everybody I hate and can't stand to watch is a globalist piece of trash.
[00:19:11.416 --> 00:19:12.759]  It just figures.
[00:19:12.759 --> 00:19:13.361]  Clint Eastwood.
[00:19:13.361 --> 00:19:14.804]  Love Clint Eastwood.
[00:19:14.804 --> 00:19:15.786]  He's aware of what's going on.
[00:19:17.386 --> 00:19:22.168]  I know he listens to one of our affiliates and was told, uh, swirling the owner that he listens to some of the shows.
[00:19:22.168 --> 00:19:30.111]  He hasn't said mine, but I'm a big fan of, uh, of, uh, obviously, uh, probably the greatest actor, uh, ever Clint Eastwood, but I'm digressing.
[00:19:30.111 --> 00:19:37.234]  We have big fish to fry and serious issues to cover and the woods are lovely, dark and deep, but I have miles to go before I sleep.
[00:19:38.533 --> 00:19:42.855]  I know he did call in on Michael Savage once and confirmed it, so he is a listener to Michael Savage.
[00:19:42.855 --> 00:19:44.616]  That's good right there.
[00:19:44.616 --> 00:19:50.658]  Lawmakers' optimistic secret 9-1-1 pages will soon see release.
[00:19:50.658 --> 00:19:54.760]  State Department ran off and stole the documents to cover up for Hillary on Benghazi.
[00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:55.680]  That's now been admitted.
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:56.641]  I mean, wow.
[00:19:56.641 --> 00:19:57.341]  It's all coming up.
[00:19:59.056 --> 00:20:00.817]  Hello, I'm Michael Reagan.

[00:23:01.754 --> 00:23:02.375]  It's true.
[00:23:02.375 --> 00:23:06.537]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[00:23:06.537 --> 00:23:08.918]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[00:23:08.918 --> 00:23:13.701]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.

[00:24:17.755 --> 00:24:23.519]  Alright, Man Cow is going to be popping in about his experiences with Prince.
[00:24:23.519 --> 00:24:27.462]  Interviews he has, he's going to be getting to us soon, where Prince talked about world government, the new world order.
[00:24:27.462 --> 00:24:38.489]  I think that's really important to understand that he was an evil conspiracy theorist who questioned the known liars that are attempting to swallow up all of humanity into their technotronic, eugenics-based slave pit.
[00:24:39.397 --> 00:24:43.578]  So he'll pop in for about 10 minutes, and then I'm going to segue off into a whole bunch of news.
[00:24:43.578 --> 00:24:54.920]  Obama is over in England at her Britannic Majesty's Palace last night and today, having lavish meals, celebrating her birthday.
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:57.901]  Happy belated birthday, Your Majesty.
[00:24:57.901 --> 00:25:06.763]  Obama lunches with the Queen as storm over Britain exiting the Euro rages.
[00:25:06.763 --> 00:25:07.763]  As the Queen turns 90,
[00:25:09.594 --> 00:25:14.417]  Report values British monarchy at $84 billion.
[00:25:14.417 --> 00:25:26.684]  Ladies and gentlemen, her cousin, Queen Beatrix, who advocated a few years ago to the new king, her son, owns Dutch Rochelle and BP with her.
[00:25:26.684 --> 00:25:35.269]  Her assets, the Dutch queen, are a state secret, but are estimated to be in the tens of trillions.
[00:25:35.269 --> 00:25:37.431]  And their junior to their cousins,
[00:25:38.274 --> 00:25:39.976]  The Transylvanian Crown.
[00:25:39.976 --> 00:25:41.278]  And I don't just say that for effect, folks.
[00:25:41.278 --> 00:25:42.319]  Look it up.
[00:25:42.319 --> 00:25:47.845]  Truth's always ten times stranger than anything you can make up.
[00:25:47.845 --> 00:25:51.009]  Prince Charles basically lives in Transylvania now.
[00:25:51.009 --> 00:25:52.191]  Totally insane.
[00:25:52.191 --> 00:25:53.993]  He's actually moved into Dracula Castle.
[00:25:53.993 --> 00:25:54.614]  I'm not making it up.
[00:25:57.196 --> 00:25:58.997]  And he looks just like him.
[00:25:58.997 --> 00:26:02.480]  And he points out, look at my, the painting of Clowns of Dracula.
[00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:04.421]  I look just like him.
[00:26:04.421 --> 00:26:10.345]  And this is the original progenitors who then took over Germania and then took over England.
[00:26:10.345 --> 00:26:12.747]  It's amazing.
[00:26:12.747 --> 00:26:13.407]  But I'm digressing.
[00:26:13.407 --> 00:26:14.828]  We're going to get into that.
[00:26:14.828 --> 00:26:16.689]  We're going to get into Chelsea Clinton coming out with the guns.
[00:26:16.689 --> 00:26:17.550]  We're going to get into
[00:26:20.336 --> 00:26:25.401]  Political correctness now coming out of the closet and saying, look, we're just here to arrest you if you use the wrong words.
[00:26:25.401 --> 00:26:26.301]  That's all being announced.
[00:26:26.301 --> 00:26:30.605]  It's all coming up in a key video that ties us all together.
[00:26:30.605 --> 00:26:33.728]  Man attacked, left for dead, run over by a cab.
[00:26:33.728 --> 00:26:34.789]  Cab didn't even stop.
[00:26:34.789 --> 00:26:38.872]  Bystanders do nothing.
[00:26:38.872 --> 00:26:41.395]  These are true zombies and it's happening all over the world now.
[00:26:42.386 --> 00:26:45.387]  Where they don't help a woman being raped in front of everyone.
[00:26:45.387 --> 00:26:47.867]  Or someone's choking and no one helps them and they die.
[00:26:47.867 --> 00:26:50.008]  And they just chirp 9-1-1, 9-1-1 and call it.
[00:26:50.008 --> 00:26:53.288]  I've seen it myself.
[00:26:53.288 --> 00:26:56.569]  And they think it's cool that they don't care about anybody.
[00:26:56.569 --> 00:27:00.030]  Soft, greedy, petulant, weak.
[00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:02.710]  Evil people.
[00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:04.351]  And they are becoming the majority.
[00:27:04.351 --> 00:27:07.231]  And they will see us, the producers, as food.
[00:27:07.231 --> 00:27:10.152]  Now, I have a couple of really exciting announcements here.
[00:27:13.368 --> 00:27:23.273]  I bought for myself and my family and others some of the obnoxious, ultra, redneck, the type of hats Grandpa would wear when he went fishing.
[00:27:23.273 --> 00:27:25.334]  Make America Great Again hats.
[00:27:25.334 --> 00:27:27.215]  And they're made in America.
[00:27:27.215 --> 00:27:31.638]  Well, we've come out with a variant that I believe is better.
[00:27:31.638 --> 00:27:34.059]  And it's Make America Free Again.
[00:27:34.059 --> 00:27:38.261]  We have it in camouflage with orange lettering.
[00:27:38.261 --> 00:27:39.302]  InfoWars.com.
[00:27:39.302 --> 00:27:41.603]  Help support the InfoWar and get the word out.
[00:27:43.524 --> 00:27:47.426]  And we have it in the obnoxious royal blue on white.
[00:27:47.426 --> 00:27:52.228]  And we have it in the super ultra redneck fire engine red.
[00:27:52.228 --> 00:27:57.451]  And then on the back it says InfoWars.com with a coiled snake.
[00:27:57.451 --> 00:28:00.112]  And I think Make America Great Again is fantastic.
[00:28:00.112 --> 00:28:00.992]  It's wonderful.
[00:28:00.992 --> 00:28:03.654]  And I admire the taste in the hats.
[00:28:03.654 --> 00:28:06.395]  And so the most sincere form of flattery is imitation.
[00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:13.246]  But these are not a rip-off of the Trump ads, because they're made in America, they're high quality, they're very similar, but it's different language.
[00:28:13.246 --> 00:28:18.150]  Make America Free Again, and then InfoWars.com and the Gadsden Snake on the back.
[00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:26.759]  So you see about 10% of the folks at Trump rallies are wearing our Hillary for Prison shirts and other things like that, and Trump gets really excited when he sees it, so I'd like to see him pick up
[00:28:27.998 --> 00:28:30.841]  To make America free again so America can be great again.
[00:28:30.841 --> 00:28:33.785]  And these hats just came in a limited run.
[00:28:33.785 --> 00:28:38.731]  And they're made in America because of all the tariffs and all the regulations and all the garbage.
[00:28:38.731 --> 00:28:43.497]  You know, these babies cost us like 14 smackers apiece of the highest quality to make them in America.
[00:28:43.497 --> 00:28:43.877]  So they're $29.95.
[00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:49.671]  Same price Trump sells his hats for, and I know why, because you've got to have a profit to run your operation.
[00:28:49.671 --> 00:29:01.393]  And just like you buy Trump's hats and t-shirts that are excellent, and I have, to help fund his campaign, and you should, help fund our information warfare operation and get these hats that will never go out of season and never go out of style.
[00:29:01.393 --> 00:29:04.653]  Make America free again.
[00:29:04.653 --> 00:29:05.594]  Infowars.com.
[00:29:05.594 --> 00:29:08.914]  And the Hillary shirts say Hillary for prison 2016 on the back.
[00:29:08.914 --> 00:29:11.815]  It says legalize freedom in red.
[00:29:11.815 --> 00:29:12.235]  Infowars.com.
[00:29:14.864 --> 00:29:18.627]  And your purchase of the apparel makes everything we do here possible.
[00:29:18.627 --> 00:29:19.788]  The nutraceuticals as well.
[00:29:19.788 --> 00:29:21.689]  By the way, there are big studies out.
[00:29:21.689 --> 00:29:22.050]  It's even in...
[00:29:24.733 --> 00:29:26.734]  Scientific American, you name it.
[00:29:26.734 --> 00:29:28.955]  I can't believe they're even admitting the truth.
[00:29:28.955 --> 00:29:37.599]  That vitamin B12 deficiency is linked to schizophrenia, mental illness, autism, and so much more.
[00:29:37.599 --> 00:29:42.762]  How many times have we told you that and they admit it's absorption in the gut?
[00:29:42.762 --> 00:29:45.623]  That's why you've got to get it sublingually.
[00:29:45.623 --> 00:29:47.224]  Secret 12 in fullwarslife.com.
[00:29:48.277 --> 00:29:52.210]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:54.878]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.201 --> 00:30:03.625]  Is the British government more worried about transgender bathrooms than ISIS?
[00:30:03.625 --> 00:30:10.972]  This week it emerged that ISIS was plotting to attack tourist beaches across Europe by posing as vendors and placing bombs under sunbeds.
[00:30:10.972 --> 00:30:18.099]  Meanwhile in North Carolina, people are being required by a new law to use public bathrooms that correspond with their biological gender.
[00:30:18.359 --> 00:30:24.983]  So, which grave threat to the Brits traveling overseas did the British Foreign Office decide to warn its citizens about?
[00:30:24.983 --> 00:30:33.449]  That's right, they wanted travelers to be aware of the controversial new bathroom laws in North Carolina and Mississippi before visiting the U.S.
[00:30:33.789 --> 00:30:39.914]  Thirty British citizens were slaughtered on a beach by ISIS jihadists in Tunisia less than a year ago.
[00:30:39.914 --> 00:30:44.138]  ISIS frequently calls for the execution of members of the LGBT community.
[00:30:44.138 --> 00:30:50.684]  The Foreign Office issues a warning about bathroom laws, yet ignores the terror threat to attack tourist beaches.
[00:30:50.684 --> 00:30:54.387]  For more on the absurdity, visit InfoWars.com right now.
[00:30:58.915 --> 00:30:59.576]  Uh, yeah.
[00:30:59.576 --> 00:31:05.400]  First of all, I want to say Bigfoot 12, X2, Supermail, Brain Force, Prostagart, Silver Bullet.
[00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:06.361]  I use them all.
[00:31:06.361 --> 00:31:07.342]  They're phenomenal.
[00:31:07.342 --> 00:31:08.082]  They work.
[00:31:08.082 --> 00:31:08.923]  Buy them, folks.
[00:31:08.923 --> 00:31:09.403]  Thank you, brother.
[00:31:09.403 --> 00:31:11.325]  I really thank you guys for putting those out there.
[00:31:11.325 --> 00:31:17.570]  I am a relatively short-time listener and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine products.
[00:31:17.570 --> 00:31:19.552]  Welcome to the InfoWar.
[00:31:19.552 --> 00:31:24.956]  It's so easy to get these incredible nutraceuticals that support your health and the InfoWar at the same time.
[00:31:25.396 --> 00:31:26.097]  I'm a nine-year listener.
[00:31:26.097 --> 00:31:29.940]  I buy all the nutraceuticals, Costco FX, Nascent Iodine.
[00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:30.781]  Let me ask you a question.
[00:31:30.781 --> 00:31:31.822]  Have they worked for you?
[00:31:31.822 --> 00:31:34.685]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[00:31:34.685 --> 00:31:36.046]  What products are you taking?
[00:31:36.046 --> 00:31:44.054]  Everything from Super Male to Brain Force to Winter Sun, X2, even got a little DNA Force.
[00:31:44.054 --> 00:31:47.517]  So I just re-upped everything and I just went to Autofill.
[00:31:47.677 --> 00:31:52.724]  Visit Infowarslife.com to read the information and research and to see the reviews for yourself.
[00:31:52.724 --> 00:31:54.766]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:07.025]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the InfoWar.
[00:32:07.025 --> 00:32:08.246]  A 360 win.
[00:32:08.246 --> 00:32:14.809]  Number one, when you choose AutoShip before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at InfoWarshore.com.
[00:32:14.809 --> 00:32:22.334]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[00:32:22.734 --> 00:32:27.798]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[00:32:27.798 --> 00:32:33.903]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[00:32:33.903 --> 00:32:41.709]  Just go to InfoWarsTore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on auto ship, and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[00:32:41.709 --> 00:32:48.914]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win, and with the new auto ship feature at InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[00:32:48.914 --> 00:32:49.715]  10% off on auto ship.
[00:32:49.875 --> 00:32:52.317]  Win-win-win at Infowarslife.com.
[00:32:52.317 --> 00:32:54.298]  Free shipping on orders above $50.
[00:32:54.298 --> 00:33:09.348]  And all out-of-stock items are never out-of-stock when you sign up for AutoShip.
[00:33:09.348 --> 00:33:11.970]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[00:33:11.970 --> 00:33:15.012]  But it's time for you to choose a side.
[00:33:15.012 --> 00:33:17.294]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:33:24.861 --> 00:33:26.423]  We don't normally cover
[00:33:36.676 --> 00:33:43.780]  A lot of entertainment news, unless it's to analyze different messages that are in that news that deal with human liberty and freedom.
[00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:45.421]  But really, I should spend more time on it.
[00:33:45.421 --> 00:33:56.348]  We're starting to do that, analyzing popular culture, because more than 80% of propaganda and globalist brainwashing is going on in the popular media, in the fictional media.
[00:33:56.348 --> 00:34:01.672]  Now, in some cases, people like Chris Carter comes out in magazine interviews, and we've talked to him now.
[00:34:01.672 --> 00:34:02.912]  I'm going to go out there and meet him soon.
[00:34:02.912 --> 00:34:03.673]  I've been too busy to.
[00:34:05.111 --> 00:34:06.672]  And he's like, no, I like Alex Jones.
[00:34:06.672 --> 00:34:08.453]  I think world government is a threat.
[00:34:08.453 --> 00:34:10.315]  And I think what he talks about is really true.
[00:34:10.315 --> 00:34:16.359]  And I base our new, you know, episodes basically on his research mixed in with space aliens.
[00:34:16.359 --> 00:34:23.104]  So there is a point at which we become so successful in the fight against the globalists and we show the proof of what they're doing.
[00:34:25.071 --> 00:34:35.319]  That folks that have been in the establishment, but not part of the agenda, are going to start really trying to help empower and awaken humanity.
[00:34:35.319 --> 00:34:36.780]  And that's happening.
[00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:50.530]  And the sheer numbers of people in Hollywood, which is the dominant culture driver of the world, the sheer numbers of people who are libertarian, or who are pro-human, or who are anti-New World Order, or conservative, is huge.
[00:34:52.102 --> 00:34:55.824]  A lot of the people that claim they're liberal on the surface, go to these secret meetings.
[00:34:55.824 --> 00:35:07.070]  And the London Guardian has a big headline about it today, that this big secret society of conservatives, that I know Mancow's actually been part of, is dissolving right now.
[00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:10.231]  Because people are so scared they're being penetrated, they're being infiltrated.
[00:35:10.231 --> 00:35:16.234]  In America, you've got to be in a secret society to be Christian, or libertarian, or conservative.
[00:35:16.234 --> 00:35:17.955]  But Kurt Russell came out and said, look, I'm just 1776.
[00:35:17.955 --> 00:35:19.956]  I'm Renaissance.
[00:35:19.956 --> 00:35:20.616]  I'm Americana.
[00:35:23.010 --> 00:35:25.412]  I'm not conservative, I'm not liberal.
[00:35:25.412 --> 00:35:33.377]  And it's the same thing out of Jeff Bridges or so many other people that folks like Mancow, because he does focus on entertainment half the time, has known over the years.
[00:35:33.377 --> 00:35:36.379]  So it's always interesting all the people that Mancow's gotten on.
[00:35:36.379 --> 00:35:38.760]  He tells me, hey, Billy Corgan's a big listener.
[00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:40.541]  Now the last six, seven years, he's been on a lot.
[00:35:40.541 --> 00:35:41.502]  We're good friends.
[00:35:41.502 --> 00:35:42.703]  We've all hung out together here in town.
[00:35:44.215 --> 00:35:49.396]  It just goes on and on, that every time Mancow tells me somebody's awake, but he goes, but you can't tell anybody, it's private.
[00:35:49.396 --> 00:36:00.739]  And then later the person comes out, not out of the closet as being gay, but out of the closet as not wanting to turn their guns in, or not wanting to ban the word mother or father.
[00:36:00.739 --> 00:36:11.982]  And Prince, seen as liberal in a lot of ways, was aware of the New World Order, the Federal Reserve, he was on Tavis Smiley's show, he talked about it, but there are a bunch of interviews with Mancow where he talked about a lot of it, mancow.com,
[00:36:14.065 --> 00:36:18.807]  Of course, syndicated TV host, radio host, Discovery Channel shows, you name it.
[00:36:18.807 --> 00:36:22.088]  He's syndicated out of the Loop there in Chicago, 97.9.
[00:36:22.088 --> 00:36:30.212]  And I want to get him on for a full hour to cover the waterfront, but he said, well, I can't do that today, but I want to pop in about Prince and what he was saying about InfoWars.
[00:36:30.212 --> 00:36:38.655]  Which is, again, not to puff the show up, but to say, see how popular our perspective on the world is?
[00:36:38.655 --> 00:36:40.436]  Because it's so accurate.
[00:36:41.556 --> 00:36:56.583]  I've had medical doctors and scientists on for over a decade saying vitamin B12 deficiencies in the gut and nutrient upload in the gut caused by biological reactions with vaccines is linked to autism, schizophrenia, and rising mental illness.
[00:36:56.583 --> 00:37:00.244]  That's in major scientific journals today.
[00:37:00.244 --> 00:37:03.446]  I'm going to be covering later.
[00:37:03.446 --> 00:37:06.387]  Low B12 seen in aging, autism, and schizophrenia.
[00:37:08.988 --> 00:37:12.709]  Decrease brain levels of vitamin B12 in aging, autism, and schizophrenia.
[00:37:12.709 --> 00:37:13.329]  Major studies.
[00:37:13.329 --> 00:37:14.569]  I'm going to be showing you this.
[00:37:14.569 --> 00:37:17.450]  The point is, this stuff's already all known.
[00:37:17.450 --> 00:37:21.331]  There's an admitted giant geoengineering program going on.
[00:37:21.331 --> 00:37:28.173]  The White House science czar wrote a book in 1974 admitting they put fluoride in the water to lower your fertility and brain damage you.
[00:37:29.454 --> 00:37:31.455]  It just makes most people stupid and docile.
[00:37:31.455 --> 00:37:33.596]  But folks that weren't going to be real smart, it makes you retarded.
[00:37:33.596 --> 00:37:35.316]  But they go, oh, don't use the word retarded.
[00:37:35.316 --> 00:37:36.477]  That's hateful.
[00:37:36.477 --> 00:37:38.398]  But let us make you mentally retarded.
[00:37:38.398 --> 00:37:41.099]  See how political correctness works?
[00:37:41.099 --> 00:37:42.319]  So Mancow joins us.
[00:37:42.319 --> 00:37:49.162]  Then we're going to get into lawmakers' optimistic secret 9-11 pages we'll soon see released, which shows our government stood down.
[00:37:50.376 --> 00:37:56.822]  And that Saudi Arabia was running at least decoy hijackers and was putting money in their accounts to fund them all over the U.S.
[00:37:56.822 --> 00:37:58.604]  Something I told you 15 years ago.
[00:37:58.604 --> 00:37:59.364]  Vindicated again.
[00:37:59.364 --> 00:38:01.587]  And I'm not up here bragging.
[00:38:01.587 --> 00:38:02.648]  Remember Mancow was on last time.
[00:38:02.648 --> 00:38:07.912]  He goes, it's now admitted giant blimps are government-run and are crashing all over the place.
[00:38:07.912 --> 00:38:08.153]  Folks.
[00:38:09.642 --> 00:38:21.208]  In the Telecommunications Act of 1996, they funded over $80 billion over the next four years to put in giant NSA snooping hubs in every system of the U.S.
[00:38:21.208 --> 00:38:22.829]  to track you.
[00:38:22.829 --> 00:38:25.631]  The funding to put it in was all public.
[00:38:25.631 --> 00:38:27.231]  I had whistleblowers on.
[00:38:27.231 --> 00:38:30.033]  That's what's so frustrating is I'm not psychic, okay?
[00:38:31.365 --> 00:38:33.668]  They admit this is the plan.
[00:38:33.668 --> 00:38:38.594]  And once they get the grid in, they're going to up the soft kill and really start killing everybody.
[00:38:38.594 --> 00:38:44.041]  So if you want to die young of cancer, or die young of Alzheimer's, or have a bunch of autistic kids, don't listen to me.
[00:38:44.693 --> 00:38:51.094]  Now, Eric Mankow Muller, in his own right, has exposed a lot of this over the years as well, so he's just tootin' my horn when he gives us credit.
[00:38:51.094 --> 00:39:07.498]  He's one of the other hosts that has been willing to talk about a lot of these issues and discuss it, and he's somebody that I think knows more celebrities than anybody else out there, because he's been syndicated all over the country and been out in California when his career first launched to be one of the top shows in the country, even rivaling Howard Stern.
[00:39:07.498 --> 00:39:08.818]  So he joins us now.
[00:39:08.818 --> 00:39:11.559]  Mankow, always great to have you here with us, my friend.
[00:39:11.559 --> 00:39:12.839]  Really sad news about Prince.
[00:39:14.052 --> 00:39:15.833]  Alex, can you hear me?
[00:39:15.833 --> 00:39:16.834]  Yes, sir.
[00:39:16.834 --> 00:39:19.875]  Okay, I'm walking through the streets of Chicago right now, my brother.
[00:39:19.875 --> 00:39:25.058]  I did replay where you talked about the blimps on my show and I laughed at you and I mocked you.
[00:39:25.058 --> 00:39:27.399]  And I can't apologize enough.
[00:39:27.399 --> 00:39:29.560]  I was wrong about so much.
[00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:31.641]  Look, you're so cutting edge.
[00:39:31.641 --> 00:39:32.962]  You're so ahead of time.
[00:39:32.962 --> 00:39:39.145]  And the stuff you say that sounds crazy today
[00:39:39.858 --> 00:39:42.139]  In five, ten years, everybody's going to go, yeah, that's right.
[00:39:42.139 --> 00:39:45.160]  Like, it's just, it becomes common knowledge.
[00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:47.960]  But you release these things, and it's the truth.
[00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:49.401]  It's just amazing.
[00:39:49.401 --> 00:39:50.961]  I have a lot to tell you today.
[00:39:50.961 --> 00:39:53.542]  First of all, I believe, let me just go through a few quick things.
[00:39:53.542 --> 00:39:55.603]  I think Zika's setting us up for something.
[00:39:55.603 --> 00:39:57.323]  They're creating a lot of fear with Zika.
[00:39:57.323 --> 00:40:01.784]  I know you'll cover it on your show, I believe, getting us ready for voterless elections.
[00:40:01.784 --> 00:40:07.166]  And they'll try out Zika to take our attention away from our freedoms being robbed.
[00:40:07.726 --> 00:40:18.408]  I went to see a Journey show and Robert Fleischman, who wrote Wheel in the Sky, he's their original lead singer, is absolutely a huge fan of yours and told me some interesting stuff.
[00:40:18.408 --> 00:40:21.429]  Wanted me to reveal the hologram universe we're living in.
[00:40:21.429 --> 00:40:23.049]  We don't have time for that now.
[00:40:23.049 --> 00:40:28.710]  But my big surprise for you has been ruined.
[00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:30.210]  How is that?
[00:40:30.210 --> 00:40:34.871]  Well, I told you about Billy, the lead singer of the Smashing Pumpkins, and I think he's one of the people that's dialed in.
[00:40:35.549 --> 00:40:46.371]  He's seen behind, uh, he's seen behind the curtain, and I'm talking stuff like, um, well, kind of like what you would see, I imagine, the way it's been described to me, like Kubrick's, uh, eyes wide shut.
[00:40:46.371 --> 00:40:54.093]  Uh, Prince also talked to me about some of these, uh, some of these parties you call the Illuminati, you call the secret societies, the satanic, uh, blood stuff.
[00:40:54.093 --> 00:41:03.435]  People wonder why Prince dropped out, and I believe it's because, uh, he was, uh, he was frightened of these entities, uh, these things like Beyonce and Jay-Z and all the others.
[00:41:04.144 --> 00:41:09.786]  You know, some people are not willing to sell their soul, and I think Prince began to shy away from that.
[00:41:09.786 --> 00:41:15.408]  So, two years ago, maybe three years ago, Prince came and wanted to see me and wanted to see my studio.
[00:41:15.408 --> 00:41:17.709]  We did not have an extensive conversation.
[00:41:17.709 --> 00:41:20.350]  He did talk a lot to the girls, the beautiful women around me.
[00:41:20.350 --> 00:41:21.470]  He did talk a lot to the girls.
[00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:24.651]  He did eat food off our craft services table.
[00:41:24.651 --> 00:41:25.972]  People had brought in food for us.
[00:41:25.972 --> 00:41:26.612]  I was shocked.
[00:41:26.612 --> 00:41:28.693]  He kind of hung out and talked to everybody.
[00:41:28.693 --> 00:41:32.434]  With me, it was pretty much he looked around the studio, looked at my equipment, was sizing me up.
[00:41:33.132 --> 00:41:36.393]  I didn't know if you wanted to do a TV show with me.
[00:41:36.393 --> 00:41:38.813]  I didn't know what it was about.
[00:41:38.813 --> 00:41:44.594]  But I spoke with him about getting him on your show and he said he would do your show.
[00:41:44.594 --> 00:41:57.956]  What we talked about and what he was fascinated with, and he said, you know, you and Alex Jones are the only ones that talk about it, is the chemtrails, the loss of freedoms through, you know, the music and everything else.
[00:41:57.956 --> 00:42:01.717]  He believed, he told me that he wanted, he believed that everything was going to go digital
[00:42:02.604 --> 00:42:06.855]  Uh, music, everything, so that if you irritated...
[00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:11.152]  The people in control, they just delete you with a push of a button.
[00:42:11.152 --> 00:42:19.136]  I remember when you said, you know, you talked to Prince and he was a listener, and I'm like, well, I think we tried to reach out to him, but that guy's got so many people around him, hard to get to.
[00:42:19.136 --> 00:42:21.757]  These guys need to speak out before their untimely deaths.
[00:42:21.757 --> 00:42:23.999]  I tell you, it's very, very sad.
[00:42:23.999 --> 00:42:29.762]  But notice he's getting an autopsy, but the Supreme Court Justice, Antonin Scalia, isn't.
[00:42:29.762 --> 00:42:35.285]  And now we've got Chelsea Clinton video we're going to play in a moment, me and Cal, who says that now he's out of the way, they can get our guns.
[00:42:36.821 --> 00:42:42.223]  Alex, I have a lot, but I want to say something, and I've been talking about this for years.
[00:42:42.223 --> 00:42:48.025]  My friend Andrew Breitbart and I, and you were to be part of that show, as you remember, in fact, we recorded a segment for Fox.
[00:42:48.025 --> 00:42:57.389]  Andrew Breitbart was going to do a segment, I'm talking Breitbart and all these other things that he started, you know, the Ariana Huffingtons, all these other people that he puffed up on the internet.
[00:42:57.389 --> 00:43:00.730]  And you know, you would watch Glenn Beck, and all he was doing was reading Breitbart.
[00:43:01.317 --> 00:43:10.504]  But Breitbart and I were working on a TV show, and he was going to do a thing on Fox News Channel, and he was going to do a segment called Future News, and he told me that he had video that would bring down Obama, blah, blah, blah.
[00:43:10.504 --> 00:43:16.208]  Hours before he was going to release it on my show and nationwide, worldwide, he was found dead.
[00:43:16.208 --> 00:43:17.849]  And they announced it immediately.
[00:43:17.849 --> 00:43:20.992]  Alex, I've been doing this since 1984, 85, okay?
[00:43:20.992 --> 00:43:22.293]  I've been doing this for a while.
[00:43:22.293 --> 00:43:23.313]  I've never seen anything like it.
[00:43:23.313 --> 00:43:28.017]  Michael Jackson, whoever, you know, Amy Winehouse.
[00:43:28.017 --> 00:43:29.058]  Don't jump to conclusions.
[00:43:29.058 --> 00:43:29.978]  We don't know who was drugs.
[00:43:29.978 --> 00:43:30.599]  Wait a minute, what?
[00:43:31.463 --> 00:43:32.544]  I've never seen anything like it.
[00:43:32.544 --> 00:43:38.408]  When Andrew Breitbart died, they said, uh, dead of natural causes.
[00:43:38.408 --> 00:43:42.331]  Within 30 minutes of him being announced that he was dead, they said natural causes.
[00:43:42.331 --> 00:43:47.035]  And now with Scalia, they announced, hey, he's dead, natural causes, no autopsy.
[00:43:47.035 --> 00:43:47.655]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:43:47.655 --> 00:43:49.016]  Listen, listen.
[00:43:49.016 --> 00:43:53.580]  And then people like me and you demanded an autopsy of Andrew Breitbart.
[00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:54.821]  And what happened?
[00:43:54.821 --> 00:43:58.864]  As the coroner was ready to give the notice, information, he was murdered.
[00:44:00.151 --> 00:44:16.281]  So, I just find it interesting that as this artist prints, and I didn't love all of his music, I'm gonna be honest with you, it's not really my genre, but 57 years old, he's talking about chemtrails, he's talking about how they're manipulating our water, how they're turning us into weaklings, how they're numbing us, how they're dumbing us down, how they're turning us into sheeple.
[00:44:16.281 --> 00:44:25.387]  Isn't it interesting that as he comes public, as he shows up on my studio and talks to me and mentions, he gets a lot of his information from Alex Jones, as all of this is happening, he's dead.
[00:44:25.387 --> 00:44:25.887]  Wow.
[00:44:25.887 --> 00:44:28.429]  Some people are telling me they think he was murdered, I don't know.
[00:44:30.609 --> 00:44:39.751]  Well, I don't know how much of this I can get into, and why don't you talk about what Billy said on your show, so I don't... his memories all blur what he's told me privately.
[00:44:39.751 --> 00:44:42.472]  Well, my big surprise was I believed I was going to kill Chris.
[00:44:42.472 --> 00:44:50.194]  Came on my show, very quiet, very diminutive, a very intelligent guy, very smart.
[00:44:50.194 --> 00:44:51.494]  You know, these guys, they're...
[00:44:52.892 --> 00:44:54.513]  The image is created, you understand.
[00:44:54.513 --> 00:44:57.354]  I mean, I also interviewed Kurt Cobain and, you know, he was an artist.
[00:44:57.354 --> 00:44:57.954]  He was tortured.
[00:44:57.954 --> 00:44:59.154]  He was all this, uh-uh.
[00:44:59.154 --> 00:45:00.135]  It was all by design.
[00:45:00.135 --> 00:45:01.495]  It was an act.
[00:45:01.495 --> 00:45:03.616]  It was an act.
[00:45:03.616 --> 00:45:04.776]  He wanted to sell records.
[00:45:04.776 --> 00:45:07.857]  He created that image to sell records, that image of not caring.
[00:45:07.857 --> 00:45:10.858]  These, you know, prints, it was an act.
[00:45:10.858 --> 00:45:11.658]  It was an act.
[00:45:11.658 --> 00:45:16.880]  He borrowed it from James Brown and Little Richard and others, but a great artist.
[00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:18.841]  What particularly do you want to talk about what Billy said?
[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:22.301]  Well, the problem is, stuff all mixes together.
[00:45:22.301 --> 00:45:27.124]  What's in confidence, what's private, and then I confirmed a lot of stuff he told me from other high-level people.
[00:45:27.124 --> 00:45:33.707]  And it's just crazy how the elite really want to have top rock stars and rappers and other people into their meetings.
[00:45:33.707 --> 00:45:39.030]  And this type of stuff, you know, I've been invited, not just to speak at Oxford and Cambridge,
[00:45:40.811 --> 00:45:42.392]  And then I was told, oh, you've been offered that?
[00:45:42.392 --> 00:45:46.073]  That's really the cover for this by a high-level person in Hollywood.
[00:45:46.073 --> 00:45:47.934]  And then sure enough, it did happen.
[00:45:47.934 --> 00:45:55.016]  And I've been invited to basically go over and be, I mean, eyes wide shut type stuff with real elites, you know.
[00:45:55.016 --> 00:45:58.217]  And the listeners are hearing this and they're going, oh, yeah, really?
[00:45:58.217 --> 00:45:59.798]  No, folks, this is real.
[00:45:59.798 --> 00:46:07.060]  That's why Vivian Kubrick, who was the protege of Stanley Kubrick, gave me the only interview she's given in 15 years about all this.
[00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:08.881]  And she knew the stuff I'd been through.
[00:46:10.382 --> 00:46:15.533]  It was, Leanne was there, we were at dinner, and she literally got down on her knees in front of me.
[00:46:15.533 --> 00:46:16.254]  And I was like, what are you doing?
[00:46:16.254 --> 00:46:17.096]  She goes, no, listen.
[00:46:17.096 --> 00:46:19.360]  She started telling me all this stuff that no one would know.
[00:46:20.407 --> 00:46:22.088]  And I can't even get into it all.
[00:46:22.088 --> 00:46:24.770]  I just wish the public knew what was really going on.
[00:46:24.770 --> 00:46:26.551]  Alex, Alex, I want to tell you something.
[00:46:26.551 --> 00:46:27.872]  Eyes wide shut, brother.
[00:46:27.872 --> 00:46:29.853]  That movie reveals a lot.
[00:46:29.853 --> 00:46:30.994]  Eyes wide shut by Kubrick.
[00:46:30.994 --> 00:46:33.375]  It's an awful movie, but these parties do happen.
[00:46:33.375 --> 00:46:37.618]  Prince talked about these parties, not just with me, but elsewhere.
[00:46:37.618 --> 00:46:44.342]  And are you willing, and you know, look, there's a great drug that my listeners have and your listeners have, and Alex, hell, you had it and I had it.
[00:46:44.986 --> 00:46:49.528]  And that drug is if we only had fame, or we only had money, or we only had this or that, we'd be happy.
[00:46:49.528 --> 00:46:53.451]  And I know, Alex, I know the battles that you've had in your life.
[00:46:53.451 --> 00:46:59.234]  But this drug, we have sold people this idea that fame will cure them.
[00:46:59.234 --> 00:47:02.815]  And so I understand, and people are literally willing to sell their soul for it.
[00:47:02.815 --> 00:47:03.876]  You and I haven't.
[00:47:03.876 --> 00:47:05.337]  And I want to tell you that Billy hasn't.
[00:47:06.077 --> 00:47:06.718]  There's a reason.
[00:47:06.718 --> 00:47:14.503]  How about this guy that fills stadiums and sells millions and millions of recordings, and yet they press lesser stars than Billy?
[00:47:14.503 --> 00:47:15.204]  Why was he promoted?
[00:47:15.204 --> 00:47:16.405]  Because he wouldn't sell out.
[00:47:16.405 --> 00:47:17.405]  Why did Prince disappear?
[00:47:17.405 --> 00:47:18.546]  Because he wouldn't sell.
[00:47:18.546 --> 00:47:22.189]  He wouldn't give them his master tapes.
[00:47:22.189 --> 00:47:22.769]  Right?
[00:47:22.769 --> 00:47:26.131]  What about me and you, where we do these shows?
[00:47:26.131 --> 00:47:28.353]  I'm reaching 2-3 million people.
[00:47:28.353 --> 00:47:29.994]  You're probably reaching more than that.
[00:47:29.994 --> 00:47:35.158]  And yet all we hear about is Anderson Cooper and Rachel Maddow, who has a couple hundred thousand people.
[00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:43.594]  It's all part of the facade, but I mean, getting back to that... We're not willing to sell out to the agenda, and if you don't do the agenda, you don't get promoted.
[00:47:43.594 --> 00:47:45.799]  If you don't have... If you don't... Yeah.
[00:47:45.799 --> 00:47:46.179]  I'm sorry.
[00:47:46.179 --> 00:47:46.861]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:47:46.861 --> 00:47:47.562]  Well, I don't even want to...
[00:47:48.826 --> 00:47:53.770]  Speaking of Breitbart, I mean, folks at that level now go around in disguises and things.
[00:47:53.770 --> 00:47:59.115]  People don't know all this just so they're not known and seen in public because they're getting followed around 24-7.
[00:47:59.115 --> 00:48:01.357]  And I don't want to get up here and whine about this stuff to people.
[00:48:01.357 --> 00:48:04.419]  They just don't know how real it is until they've experienced it.
[00:48:04.419 --> 00:48:07.982]  And I know the circles you've been in, you've experienced even more of this than I have.
[00:48:07.982 --> 00:48:15.669]  But I was talking to just even Mark Dice when they were getting ready to give him a national TV show with some of the folks from Motley Crue.
[00:48:17.546 --> 00:48:22.120]  He's in the meeting, and the head producer, not with Motley Crue, but with his big TV network, goes, listen.
[00:48:23.004 --> 00:48:24.785]  Mark, what's wrong with the devil?
[00:48:24.785 --> 00:48:25.785]  What's wrong with Satan?
[00:48:25.785 --> 00:48:35.510]  I'm sorry, praising Lucifer and asking him to join with Lucifer and the guy was in a religious experience trying to sell him on it and people just don't understand.
[00:48:35.510 --> 00:48:38.931]  They don't know what happens next level.
[00:48:38.931 --> 00:48:44.534]  And you've got all these shows where Lucifer's this sweet guy out in LA, you know, on TV now and he loves everybody.
[00:48:44.534 --> 00:48:48.616]  I mean, these people are really trying to bring in this satanic takeover and you look at
[00:48:49.853 --> 00:48:57.637]  Lady Gaga has to have bodyguards around her at night because she's terrorized by demons and ghosts and screaming and yelling and flopping around.
[00:48:57.637 --> 00:48:58.617]  Kesha.
[00:48:58.617 --> 00:49:04.640]  All these people have become just conduits of interdimensional evil, whatever you want to call it.
[00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:05.701]  It is insane.
[00:49:05.701 --> 00:49:12.284]  And every Super Bowl and every big award show is turned into some type of huge Babylonian witchcraft event.
[00:49:12.284 --> 00:49:13.705]  What do you think this is all about, man cow?
[00:49:14.261 --> 00:49:16.723]  Alex, I know exactly what it's about, and I want to tell you something, brother.
[00:49:16.723 --> 00:49:27.272]  You say interdimensional, and I had on John Henderson the brilliant voice of Yes, who has the ability, he says, to see into the fourth dimension.
[00:49:27.272 --> 00:49:34.999]  And look, you know, however you want to, you can go the science route, you can go the biblical route.
[00:49:34.999 --> 00:49:38.802]  As we touch that quickly, I do want to say that Chris Carter did confirm
[00:49:39.545 --> 00:49:42.830]  That the character of Joel was based on you in the last incarnation.
[00:49:42.830 --> 00:49:43.972]  I thought it was wonderful of X-Files.
[00:49:43.972 --> 00:49:45.814]  He told me that that was you.
[00:49:45.814 --> 00:49:48.178]  He told me that on the radio, so I have tape.
[00:49:48.178 --> 00:49:49.099]  I have proof.
[00:49:49.099 --> 00:49:50.441]  Well, no, I mean, it's not even a big deal.
[00:49:50.441 --> 00:49:54.246]  I mean, he said it in a bunch of newspaper articles, and the media said I was running a house.
[00:49:54.747 --> 00:49:56.208]  Let's get back to this.
[00:49:56.208 --> 00:49:57.849]  Why do all these artists go broke?
[00:49:57.849 --> 00:49:58.649]  The entourage.
[00:49:58.649 --> 00:50:00.150]  Why are they up all the time?
[00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:02.491]  Why do they not have mirrors?
[00:50:02.491 --> 00:50:14.899]  If you talk to anyone who does this interdimensional demonic stuff, they conjure faces and they are given their marching orders and speak to people, or creatures, whatever it is, goat-headed figures, and I've heard all kinds of- Oh, that's what it does.
[00:50:14.899 --> 00:50:15.439]  Skip the line.
[00:50:15.439 --> 00:50:16.800]  And they don't have mirrors.
[00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:17.660]  They can't sleep.
[00:50:17.660 --> 00:50:18.641]  They're terrified now.
[00:50:19.742 --> 00:50:22.965]  Think about how much fame would you like?
[00:50:22.965 --> 00:50:24.347]  Not you, Alex, just everybody.
[00:50:24.347 --> 00:50:25.968]  How much fame, how much money would you like?
[00:50:25.968 --> 00:50:32.595]  Would you want to be Prince, who was terrified, who was locked away in Paisley Park in Minnesota?
[00:50:32.595 --> 00:50:35.178]  He couldn't get away from those people.
[00:50:35.178 --> 00:50:36.740]  Would you like to be Michael Jackson?
[00:50:36.740 --> 00:50:37.741]  Would you like to be Elvis?
[00:50:39.130 --> 00:50:41.551]  You know, when these people get everything, what do they want to do?
[00:50:41.551 --> 00:50:42.832]  They want to get away from it.
[00:50:42.832 --> 00:50:44.292]  But this is what they're selling us.
[00:50:44.292 --> 00:50:46.734]  This is every TV show aimed at our kids, Alex.
[00:50:46.734 --> 00:50:47.754]  This is every message.
[00:50:47.754 --> 00:50:48.054]  I know.
[00:50:48.054 --> 00:50:50.455]  Look, I've had a point-blank since I was about 13.
[00:50:50.455 --> 00:50:55.178]  I've had these people try to recruit me, and it is just... They are so unhappy.
[00:50:55.178 --> 00:50:57.899]  Why on earth would I ever want to work with these people?
[00:50:57.899 --> 00:51:04.142]  But Alex, look, if you want wealth and you want fame, and you haven't had a background of any kind of anything,
[00:51:04.716 --> 00:51:08.758]  You know, I love these parents today in 2016 that say, well, I'm not going to pick religion.
[00:51:08.758 --> 00:51:09.579]  I'll let the kids pick.
[00:51:09.579 --> 00:51:10.980]  Oh, they're going to pick.
[00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:11.940]  They're going to pick.
[00:51:11.940 --> 00:51:12.981]  You're letting the system pick.
[00:51:12.981 --> 00:51:15.242]  Let me bring this up back to Prince.
[00:51:15.242 --> 00:51:19.905]  So you're saying this wasn't even too long ago he wanted to reach out and come on my show.
[00:51:19.905 --> 00:51:21.466]  It was two, three years ago.
[00:51:21.466 --> 00:51:23.067]  Everybody wants to hear tidbits of this.
[00:51:23.067 --> 00:51:25.588]  Specifically, what did he say about the New World Order?
[00:51:25.588 --> 00:51:27.409]  What did he say about different issues?
[00:51:27.409 --> 00:51:29.850]  I had a TV show off Michigan Avenue.
[00:51:29.850 --> 00:51:30.371]  He came in.
[00:51:31.050 --> 00:51:39.257]  He put his fingers together like he was praying, and put his fingers on his chin, and looked at my equipment, looked at the ceiling, looked me up and down, looked around.
[00:51:39.257 --> 00:51:41.139]  This went on for quite some time.
[00:51:41.139 --> 00:51:48.706]  When we finally had some time, he was very quiet, and he said that, you know, you and Alex Jones are the only ones who are talented like it is.
[00:51:48.706 --> 00:51:52.729]  And he did talk about some parties that he had been to that were, you know,
[00:51:54.062 --> 00:51:58.706]  Like you said, you can say satanic, you can say Babylonian, however you want to label it.
[00:51:58.706 --> 00:52:02.129]  And I've been to these parties, we've talked about it on this show before.
[00:52:02.129 --> 00:52:04.651]  Um, full-on satanic stuff, man.
[00:52:04.651 --> 00:52:06.913]  And, uh, you know, it's uncloaking.
[00:52:06.913 --> 00:52:09.995]  It's not, it's not even, I mean, I'm acting like this is some big story.
[00:52:09.995 --> 00:52:11.377]  Does anybody doubt it?
[00:52:11.377 --> 00:52:12.237]  Evil is uncloaking.
[00:52:12.237 --> 00:52:13.078]  Devil's advocate.
[00:52:13.078 --> 00:52:15.060]  We need a good, you know, that used to be something.
[00:52:15.060 --> 00:52:15.840]  Devil's advocate.
[00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:17.081]  Evil doesn't need an advocate.
[00:52:17.081 --> 00:52:19.644]  Everybody's the devil's advocate now.
[00:52:19.644 --> 00:52:21.085]  Somebody needs to be an advocate for good.
[00:52:22.108 --> 00:52:27.972]  Okay, so, so, you know, he wanted to talk, he, I had done a piece on the History Channel about fluoride he had seen.
[00:52:27.972 --> 00:52:32.676]  He wanted to talk about, you and I have talked about this a lot, the poison in the water that's dumbing us down.
[00:52:32.676 --> 00:52:33.977]  Folks, get a water filter.
[00:52:33.977 --> 00:52:35.218]  Prince was a big believer in that.
[00:52:36.462 --> 00:52:40.645]  And even that, it will seep in through your skin through showers, he felt.
[00:52:40.645 --> 00:52:41.926]  Of course it is.
[00:52:41.926 --> 00:52:42.987]  It was all about neutering us.
[00:52:42.987 --> 00:52:44.288]  It was all about dumbing us down.
[00:52:44.288 --> 00:52:45.229]  It's all by design.
[00:52:45.229 --> 00:52:47.010]  Why don't we get upset?
[00:52:47.010 --> 00:52:49.552]  Prince talked about seeing these chemtrails.
[00:52:49.552 --> 00:52:53.234]  I've seen it in Chicago, and I've been laughed at and mocked.
[00:52:53.234 --> 00:52:56.456]  By the way, let me play a clip, because mainstream media will say we made this up.
[00:52:56.456 --> 00:52:59.819]  Let's play him on Tavis Smiley a few years ago, five years ago.
[00:52:59.819 --> 00:53:03.782]  Prince, rare interview, talking about the geoengineering going on, chemtrails.
[00:53:03.782 --> 00:53:04.042]  Here it is.
[00:53:05.269 --> 00:53:08.351]  What he said affects all of us.
[00:53:08.351 --> 00:53:18.958]  He said something that really hit home about this phenomena of chemtrails.
[00:53:18.958 --> 00:53:26.163]  And, you know, when I was a kid, I used to see these trails in the sky all the time.
[00:53:26.163 --> 00:53:28.164]  And I said, oh, that's cool.
[00:53:28.164 --> 00:53:29.905]  A jet just went over.
[00:53:29.905 --> 00:53:32.107]  And then you started to see a whole bunch of them.
[00:53:33.101 --> 00:53:38.423]  And next thing you know, everybody in your neighborhood was fighting and arguing and you didn't know why.
[00:53:38.423 --> 00:53:39.703]  Okay?
[00:53:39.703 --> 00:53:41.164]  And you really didn't know why.
[00:53:41.164 --> 00:53:44.164]  I mean, everybody was fighting.
[00:53:44.164 --> 00:53:51.027]  So he started riffing about the chemtrails.
[00:53:51.027 --> 00:53:57.789]  And he started to say things that hit home so hard.
[00:53:57.789 --> 00:53:58.469]  And I would
[00:53:59.494 --> 00:54:07.196]  Recommend that everybody try to get what he said online or wherever.
[00:54:07.196 --> 00:54:14.218]  And that's Prince talking about Dick Gregory, he's been a guest many times on the show, talking about geoengineering, social engineering, the flora and the water, you name it.
[00:54:14.218 --> 00:54:25.621]  Hey Alex, I did remember something listening to that, something I remember that he said, and I've heard this a lot, and I've said it to you, and maybe I shouldn't put this out there, but
[00:54:27.768 --> 00:54:30.849]  Brother, I gotta be very careful here for both of us.
[00:54:30.849 --> 00:54:35.469]  But he did give me a warning for you and for me.
[00:54:35.469 --> 00:54:40.010]  He felt that you and I should be very, very careful.
[00:54:40.010 --> 00:54:44.451]  I remember you said you talked to Prince, but you couldn't tell me what, and we should try to get him on, but it never happened, I guess.
[00:54:44.451 --> 00:54:48.452]  So I guess he came over to your show, but didn't get into all this.
[00:54:48.452 --> 00:54:55.233]  But, um... You're messing with dangerous stuff here, brother, and remember this.
[00:54:55.233 --> 00:54:56.333]  As in the times of Noah,
[00:54:57.498 --> 00:55:03.159]  And this is, it's snowballing now, it's gathering, it's gathering, it's rolling, it's getting worse, isn't it?
[00:55:03.159 --> 00:55:10.340]  Did you hear the song Merle Haggard did a few years ago called What I Hate, and it's all about chemtrails?
[00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:26.123]  Yeah, but of course, if you and I talk about that, I mean, I can tell you in, I saw it in San Francisco and I've seen it in Chicago numerous times, the planes crisscross, the cars get all sticky, I've had it analyzed, it's, I mean, we know what it is, they're dropping chemicals,
[00:55:27.188 --> 00:55:29.449]  And, uh, it's... I mean, look at Chicago right now.
[00:55:29.449 --> 00:55:30.249]  Look at the taxes.
[00:55:30.249 --> 00:55:32.590]  Look at the murder, man.
[00:55:32.590 --> 00:55:36.751]  Do you know that where I live, Cook County, is the number one place in North America that people want to leave?
[00:55:36.751 --> 00:55:39.112]  You already had the highest crime rate in the world.
[00:55:39.112 --> 00:55:40.813]  It doubled in the last year.
[00:55:40.813 --> 00:55:41.133]  Yeah.
[00:55:41.133 --> 00:55:42.453]  No, everybody's docile.
[00:55:42.453 --> 00:55:43.234]  Why?
[00:55:43.234 --> 00:55:50.116]  Because when it gets hot and people start getting angry about the state of things, they fly over and drop these chemicals on us.
[00:55:51.235 --> 00:55:53.300]  And then everybody walks around for the next week or two.
[00:55:53.300 --> 00:55:54.082]  I've seen it.
[00:55:54.082 --> 00:55:55.706]  It's just what Prince was saying.
[00:55:55.706 --> 00:56:00.717]  And then everybody walks around like they're, you know, they're walkers from The Walking Dead.
[00:56:01.997 --> 00:56:14.324]  Yeah, the Sunshine Project, about 16 years ago, got a declassified document on the Marines' preparation with choppers to gas hole fillies.
[00:56:14.324 --> 00:56:22.529]  We have more estrogen in our water in Chicago than they have in, you know, pills for women, in birth control pills.
[00:56:22.529 --> 00:56:26.731]  And I had on the person in charge of this from the city, and I said, what's that?
[00:56:26.731 --> 00:56:27.852]  Oh, women are flushing their pills.
[00:56:29.279 --> 00:56:31.661]  Yeah, well, when women don't use their pills, they flush them, you know?
[00:56:31.661 --> 00:56:44.132]  But then they did a study, even AP admitted it's much higher than even what runoff can cause, and they found it's a base Prozac chemical, a base estrogen chemical, it's like an industrial level, and the White House Science Center admits it.
[00:56:44.132 --> 00:56:53.120]  Well, Prince is gone, but there is a global awakening taking place, and I hope he'll come on next week for a full hour and take calls, get into the election, and everything else that's coming up, mancow.com.
[00:56:54.521 --> 00:56:59.222]  I guess we've got to work harder and actually try to get these celebrities on the show.
[00:56:59.222 --> 00:57:05.383]  My first thought when I heard his death was I'd let you down because I was working behind the scenes to get him on and I promised you that.
[00:57:05.383 --> 00:57:06.723]  Hey, what about Jeff Bridges?
[00:57:06.723 --> 00:57:09.184]  I wish I wouldn't have missed the call that night you guys were together.
[00:57:09.184 --> 00:57:12.604]  I didn't even try to get him on.
[00:57:12.604 --> 00:57:14.905]  I'm going to be seeing Bo Bridges here shortly.
[00:57:14.905 --> 00:57:17.785]  In fact, I think I may be seeing him tomorrow night.
[00:57:17.785 --> 00:57:19.906]  Bo is a family friend.
[00:57:23.599 --> 00:57:25.200]  I'll work on that as well.
[00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:32.465]  Well obviously brother, how about we both get on a plane, let's fly out and interview Bridges.
[00:57:32.465 --> 00:57:34.926]  And let's do Kurt Russell while we're at it, and Chris Carter.
[00:57:34.926 --> 00:57:39.409]  Let's just line them all up like Big Lebowski and knock those pens down.
[00:57:39.409 --> 00:57:40.569]  Let's do it.
[00:57:40.569 --> 00:57:44.052]  I've got another biggie for you soon.
[00:57:44.052 --> 00:57:45.252]  I'm working on it.
[00:57:45.252 --> 00:57:47.774]  I know, but then tell us now.
[00:57:48.789 --> 00:57:49.809]  Well, no, I know what you're saying.
[00:57:49.809 --> 00:57:52.610]  No, but brother, look at Gary Oldman.
[00:57:52.610 --> 00:57:53.490]  Look at some of these people.
[00:57:53.490 --> 00:58:02.852]  The minute you come out and say, yeah, I mean, when you see behind the curtain, if you tell people, half of them are going to mock you and the other half are going to try to degrade you.
[00:58:02.852 --> 00:58:05.153]  I think that's changing, man.
[00:58:05.153 --> 00:58:06.293]  Oh, Merle Haggard.
[00:58:06.293 --> 00:58:10.494]  That's right.
[00:58:10.494 --> 00:58:11.575]  Merle Haggard was awake.
[00:58:11.575 --> 00:58:12.195]  Prince was awake.
[00:58:12.195 --> 00:58:13.355]  Everybody else used to be awake.
[00:58:13.355 --> 00:58:15.296]  David Bowie, you knew him pretty good.
[00:58:15.296 --> 00:58:15.676]  30 seconds.
[00:58:15.676 --> 00:58:16.816]  Any tidbits on David Bowie?
[00:58:17.936 --> 00:58:24.641]  Uh, Bowie, uh, I believe Bowie, uh, got, uh, illegal, uh, fetal cells, uh, injected into his face.
[00:58:24.641 --> 00:58:26.322]  He did not seem to age.
[00:58:26.322 --> 00:58:27.322]  Uh, I believe he's going to Europe.
[00:58:27.322 --> 00:58:29.424]  I believe it's the same thing that the Queen of England does.
[00:58:29.424 --> 00:58:30.845]  You said this before he died.
[00:58:30.845 --> 00:58:32.105]  You said he looked like a vampire.
[00:58:32.105 --> 00:58:32.706]  He looked so good.
[00:58:33.223 --> 00:58:33.804]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:58:33.804 --> 00:58:35.365]  But I mean, the same thing with the Queen of England.
[00:58:35.365 --> 00:58:40.471]  These people are getting blood transfusions, genetic manipulation, and they're doing a lot more with... Hold on, we're going to break.
[00:58:40.471 --> 00:58:41.292]  We're going to do five more.
[00:58:41.292 --> 00:58:42.152]  Mancow, stay with us.
[00:58:42.152 --> 00:58:42.993]  With fetals?
[00:58:42.993 --> 00:58:43.194]  Okay.
[00:58:48.639 --> 00:58:52.160]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:58:52.160 --> 00:59:00.402]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:00.402 --> 00:59:05.824]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:59:05.824 --> 00:59:08.345]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[00:59:51.184 --> 01:00:11.148]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:11.148 --> 01:00:16.789]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:00:16.789 --> 01:00:19.050]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:00:20.564 --> 01:00:23.866]  I see your hair is burning.
[01:00:23.866 --> 01:00:26.527]  Hills are filled with fire.
[01:00:26.527 --> 01:00:29.229]  Hills are filled with fire.
[01:00:29.229 --> 01:00:31.710]  If they say I never loved you.
[01:00:31.710 --> 01:00:34.331]  If they say I never loved you.
[01:00:34.331 --> 01:00:37.053]  You know they were a liar.
[01:00:42.691 --> 01:00:49.554]  Why don't we just go out and sit out by the lake today?
[01:00:49.554 --> 01:00:52.075]  It's a beautiful day outside.
[01:00:52.075 --> 01:00:58.297]  Cops and cars!
[01:00:58.297 --> 01:01:00.698]  Never saw a woman.
[01:01:00.698 --> 01:01:00.878]  L.A.
[01:01:00.878 --> 01:01:01.959]  is so alone.
[01:01:01.959 --> 01:01:03.279]  So alone!
[01:01:03.279 --> 01:01:06.321]  Talk about the spirit of L.A.
[01:01:06.321 --> 01:01:07.181]  Powerful poetry.
[01:01:08.851 --> 01:01:10.512]  So alone.
[01:01:10.512 --> 01:01:11.173]  So alone.
[01:01:11.173 --> 01:01:14.475]  It's the most soulless city I've ever been in.
[01:01:14.475 --> 01:01:15.555]  Motel money.
[01:01:15.555 --> 01:01:16.096]  Murder.
[01:01:16.096 --> 01:01:16.896]  Madness.
[01:01:16.896 --> 01:01:18.737]  Dallas is a close second.
[01:01:18.737 --> 01:01:21.879]  Rome's got a fiery... Sadness.
[01:01:21.879 --> 01:01:24.981]  Sadness.
[01:01:24.981 --> 01:01:28.504]  History and will and a lot of rage.
[01:01:28.504 --> 01:01:31.666]  New York's got sophistication.
[01:01:31.666 --> 01:01:36.869]  Beauty but envy and... Sense of...
[01:01:39.754 --> 01:01:42.696]  Rotting.
[01:01:42.696 --> 01:01:45.758]  But L.A.
[01:01:45.758 --> 01:01:45.978]  L.A.'
[01:01:45.958 --> 01:01:51.722]  's a hole in the ground right to hell.
[01:01:51.722 --> 01:01:57.125]  City of lost angels.
[01:01:57.125 --> 01:02:00.407]  Yeah, if I was the devil, that's where I'd be.
[01:02:00.407 --> 01:02:06.111]  That's why anybody who knows anything stays out of there.
[01:02:12.714 --> 01:02:16.296]  Gotta keep on ridin'!
[01:02:16.296 --> 01:02:24.081]  Ugh, hard to turn good music like that off, isn't it?
[01:02:24.081 --> 01:02:29.785]  Gotta keep on ridin', ridin'!
[01:02:29.785 --> 01:02:32.687]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we are back.
[01:02:32.687 --> 01:02:34.448]  John Harmon, I heard you just pop in your ear, what'd you say?
[01:02:37.435 --> 01:02:39.456]  Yeah, you're a sweetheart.
[01:02:39.456 --> 01:02:46.500]  I'll tell you, John Harmon's been up there at GCN for a long time, and I used to, we'd produce the whole show up there, and I would just sit there in my house doing the show.
[01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:50.863]  I've done it in studios and stuff before, but I like doing it out of my bedroom.
[01:02:50.863 --> 01:02:57.047]  And Harmon just has always been there, and I could produce the whole show here, obviously, but still, he's there.
[01:02:57.047 --> 01:03:02.550]  And it's good to have him there at the network, watching everything, make sure the satellite uplinks are up, and calls go through him and a lot more.
[01:03:04.565 --> 01:03:12.169]  There's probably certain bumper music we shouldn't air because I do that horrible sing-along kind of like the children's show where the bouncing ball goes along the words.
[01:03:12.169 --> 01:03:13.610]  I'll definitely try to keep my day job.
[01:03:13.610 --> 01:03:30.039]  Let me try to reset here looking at all that news because I just did that interview with Man Cow about Prince and the occult and everything else and I'm sure they'll have dinosaur cackling pundit
[01:03:31.894 --> 01:03:50.107]  Critic media where no one knows Prince, or no one knows Billy Corgan, or no one knows Dave Mustaine, or no one knows Viggo Mortensen, or no one knows Jeff Bridges, or no one knows Charlie Sheen, or no one knows Ron Paul, or no one knows Donald Trump, or no one knows... But they can sit there and just say we're making it up.
[01:03:52.090 --> 01:04:06.636]  You see, that's what you do when you're just some low-paid minion who pretends they've got power when they're regurgitating disinformation on the American people, vomiting on their fellow humans poison.
[01:04:06.636 --> 01:04:19.541]  But the mommy globalist bird flaps down, opens its beak up, and dumps the hot elixir down their throat, and then they proceed to try to vomit it on us, and all I'm saying is, no thank you, no thank you, no thank you.
[01:04:20.919 --> 01:04:26.101]  You mean selling out to this feels like I'm having my guts torn out?
[01:04:26.101 --> 01:04:28.942]  And feels cold and lonely and horrible?
[01:04:28.942 --> 01:04:32.403]  I'm gonna go in the opposite direction of this as fast as I can.
[01:04:32.403 --> 01:04:36.184]  People say, takes a lot to not sell out to the New World Order.
[01:04:36.184 --> 01:04:37.104]  Takes a lot?
[01:04:37.104 --> 01:04:41.106]  What are you talking about?
[01:04:41.106 --> 01:04:41.706]  Takes a lot?
[01:04:44.142 --> 01:04:54.555]  I guess if your soul is kind of like man cows that have never had anything or never had cool family or didn't have any culture or any soul, then I guess, I guess the devil comes along, you know.
[01:04:54.555 --> 01:04:57.439]  If a cow wants to buy your soul, I guess you do it.
[01:04:59.028 --> 01:05:06.412]  A recent story by the Financial Times confirms that Daesh, also known as the Islamic State, was created in part by the Saudis.
[01:05:06.412 --> 01:05:13.275]  According to the late Saudi Foreign Minister, Islamic State was cobbled together in response to the Shia government in Iraq following the U.S.
[01:05:13.275 --> 01:05:16.197]  invasion of the country and the execution of Saddam Hussein.
[01:05:16.377 --> 01:05:25.065]  The story ignores the fact the Saudis collaborated with the CIA and Pakistani intelligence to create the Afghan Arabs, which would become Al-Qaeda.
[01:05:25.065 --> 01:05:32.932]  Other factions of the CIA organized and Saudi-funded Mujahideen coalesced into another fanatical Wahhabi group, the Taliban.
[01:05:32.932 --> 01:05:38.477]  In 2006, Al-Qaeda in Iraq merged with several other Sunni Wahhabi groups to form the Islamic State of Iraq.
[01:05:38.477 --> 01:05:40.159]  When the group moved into Syria in 2013, it became ISIS.
[01:05:42.341 --> 01:05:49.485]  The missing 28 pages will allegedly show Saudi complicity in the 9-11 attacks, but it will not show the role played by the CIA.
[01:05:49.485 --> 01:05:54.768]  The same can be said for the role played by the CIA and the Pentagon in the creation of terrorist groups.

[01:05:58.513 --> 01:06:05.015]  More than two years ago, InfoWars first told you about our research into what has been called the Iodine Conspiracy.
[01:06:05.015 --> 01:06:17.798]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ, and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[01:06:17.998 --> 01:06:21.660]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[01:06:21.660 --> 01:06:28.645]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[01:06:28.645 --> 01:06:41.433]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[01:06:41.513 --> 01:06:43.354]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[01:06:43.354 --> 01:06:49.759]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.

[01:06:58.573 --> 01:07:02.075]  Infowarslife.com, oil of oregano formulation.
[01:07:02.075 --> 01:07:07.678]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.
[01:07:07.678 --> 01:07:15.582]  A highly advanced nutraceutical form of this key herb that has been traditionally used by civilizations for thousands of years to promote health.
[01:07:16.022 --> 01:07:22.167]  Sourced from top leading manufacturers to ensure a concentrated level of bioactive ingredients.
[01:07:22.167 --> 01:07:30.833]  Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy-to-use capsules, you will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[01:07:31.253 --> 01:07:37.477]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health.
[01:07:37.477 --> 01:07:44.241]  Wild crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[01:07:44.241 --> 01:07:49.604]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.
[01:07:49.604 --> 01:07:52.086]  Now available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:07:52.086 --> 01:07:54.107]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:08:01.542 --> 01:08:08.186]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:08.186 --> 01:08:18.712]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:18.712 --> 01:08:19.833]  Until the bottom of the hour,
[01:08:20.837 --> 01:08:28.539]  With Mark Moreno of Climate Depot joining us to talk about all the fraud of Earth Day and what's really behind Earth Day and how it's an anti-human death cult.
[01:08:28.539 --> 01:08:33.341]  Look at the peace symbol that was rolled out around the same time by the UN and others.
[01:08:33.341 --> 01:08:35.942]  It is the Nordic Death Rune.
[01:08:37.316 --> 01:08:39.477]  And of course, Earth Day is on V.I.
[01:08:39.477 --> 01:08:40.917]  Lennon's birthday.
[01:08:40.917 --> 01:08:46.039]  They also celebrate International Communist Day and Workers' Day on May Day, May 1st.
[01:08:46.039 --> 01:08:48.520]  It's also a high occultic day.
[01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:50.361]  And they admit this, by the way, in their own literature.
[01:08:50.361 --> 01:08:55.943]  This is a Luciferian global death cult that we're dealing with.
[01:08:57.179 --> 01:09:11.187]  Now, before we go any further, we have come out, because I really like the Donald Trump hats that say, Make America Great Again, but I've been saying, you know, for the last six months, we need to make America free again before she can be great again.
[01:09:11.187 --> 01:09:26.376]  And so we've come out with three hats, a camouflage hat that has the hunter orange, a royal blue that has the white, Make America Free Again, and a fire engine red, Make America Great Again, Made in America hats, and on the back it says, Infowars.com,
[01:09:28.237 --> 01:09:31.082]  With the Gadsden flag on the back.
[01:09:31.082 --> 01:09:34.048]  So, somewhat similar but quite a bit different from the Trump hats.
[01:09:34.048 --> 01:09:36.753]  I just like the hats when I bought some for my kids.
[01:09:36.753 --> 01:09:37.274]  And myself.
[01:09:37.274 --> 01:09:39.478]  And also we got some for the crew here that wanted them.
[01:09:40.526 --> 01:09:43.288]  So I thought, why not get a Made in America hat?
[01:09:43.288 --> 01:09:45.751]  Our hats are Made in America, a big line of them at Madein1776.com.
[01:09:45.751 --> 01:09:51.435]  And I thought, you know, why not come out with this popular general design of a hat?
[01:09:51.435 --> 01:09:57.741]  I mean, all it looks like is a truck driver hat from the 70s, but it's really well made right here in America, super high quality.
[01:09:57.741 --> 01:10:06.989]  And so you can get all three of the hats together, or you can get them, obviously, individually at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:10:08.629 --> 01:10:12.213]  That's InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:10:12.213 --> 01:10:15.356]  Or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:10:15.356 --> 01:10:22.324]  I'm about to get into all the news and so much more in a bunch of clips and very draconian anti-gun behavior that's happening.
[01:10:22.324 --> 01:10:27.369]  We also have the new Skeletal Defense Pack in at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:36.603]  Super high quality, organic, made in America, joint formula that has a bunch of compounds known to help your joints and support them.
[01:10:36.603 --> 01:10:39.624]  And then our new bone support that just came in a few days ago.
[01:10:39.624 --> 01:10:42.345]  These two together, 20% off.
[01:10:42.345 --> 01:10:46.086]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:10:46.086 --> 01:10:51.488]  But speaking of that, I want to get into Secret 12 here today.
[01:10:52.438 --> 01:10:55.419]  Just for a few minutes, and this is a plug but also news.
[01:10:55.419 --> 01:11:00.740]  This is a serious public service announcement that I'm about to engage in.
[01:11:00.740 --> 01:11:12.603]  Interviewing all these different scientists and doctors and researchers, we know that the gut has less and less flora in it from the pesticides, from the Roundup, you name it.
[01:11:12.603 --> 01:11:15.964]  And that you add vaccines, live vaccines into that and others,
[01:11:16.994 --> 01:11:22.856]  They find the antibodies to those vaccines in the intestines of the children that have autism across the board.
[01:11:22.856 --> 01:11:25.197]  And there's new news on this today.
[01:11:25.197 --> 01:11:28.078]  So there's a lot of stuff going on here.
[01:11:28.078 --> 01:11:34.140]  But now Live Science and others are reporting on major scientific study with a whole list of top scientists.
[01:11:34.140 --> 01:11:36.741]  I'm going to go over this in a moment.
[01:11:36.741 --> 01:11:45.905]  Showing that the autistic children they looked at in this study all had the B12 level of basically a 75 year old person.
[01:11:46.715 --> 01:11:50.599]  Because it decreases as you get older.
[01:11:50.599 --> 01:11:56.124]  And they believe it's because there's something happening in their guts that's not letting them absorb it.
[01:11:56.124 --> 01:12:06.454]  Now we had Dr. Wakefield in about this last week, and we have the government going after people like Robert De Niro, trying to stop him from showing the film, Vax, that was produced partially right here where I'm sitting.
[01:12:07.605 --> 01:12:10.668]  This is how desperate they are to shut this down.
[01:12:10.668 --> 01:12:17.336]  Now, we sell Secret 12 that is the very best organic, vegan-based vitamin B12 out there.
[01:12:17.336 --> 01:12:20.259]  You take it sublingually.
[01:12:20.259 --> 01:12:21.060]  It tastes sweet.
[01:12:21.060 --> 01:12:24.844]  There's no sugar in it because pure vitamin B12 tastes sweet.
[01:12:24.844 --> 01:12:26.866]  It's 80% methylcobalamin and then 20%
[01:12:28.615 --> 01:12:32.437]  A didacylcobalamin, which helps with the upload of it.
[01:12:32.437 --> 01:12:37.219]  And from our research, this is the very best you can get that's actually absorbable.
[01:12:37.219 --> 01:12:41.521]  Because most people, for whatever reason, aren't absorbing as much as they should in their guts.
[01:12:41.521 --> 01:12:45.963]  The kids that are totally fried because of it, and brain damaged because of it, you notice them.
[01:12:45.963 --> 01:12:47.784]  But that's because they were overexposed.
[01:12:47.784 --> 01:12:54.507]  We're supposed to be soft killed with the fluoride and the gut flora shut down, and all the rest of it, and not know this is going on.
[01:12:55.947 --> 01:12:57.468]  It's just supposed to stun us.
[01:12:57.468 --> 01:13:01.789]  Now, the reason I talk about this is, when I was 40, I've talked a lot about this.
[01:13:01.789 --> 01:13:03.670]  Talk about some private stuff here briefly.
[01:13:03.670 --> 01:13:11.753]  When I was 40, family and everybody said, listen, you're under a lot of stress, you're overweight, you're working out more now, losing some weight, go see a doctor.
[01:13:11.753 --> 01:13:22.377]  And I researched who are the top, you know, MDs that are also cutting edge and actually test your blood and actually look at things you might be deficient in that are kind of segwaying over into alternative medicine.
[01:13:23.672 --> 01:13:25.433]  It took me six months to get in to see the guy.
[01:13:25.433 --> 01:13:27.713]  I'm not gonna get into his name, he's a private person.
[01:13:27.713 --> 01:13:30.454]  He's got a line around the block, people trying to get in there.
[01:13:30.454 --> 01:13:33.455]  He tested my blood, it took like six ampules.
[01:13:33.455 --> 01:13:35.836]  Took a month for the results to come back.
[01:13:35.836 --> 01:13:44.199]  And he said, listen, here's a couple supplements I want you to take, they're medical grade, you gotta get a prescription for them, but they're not prescription.
[01:13:44.199 --> 01:13:47.320]  He's got a prescription from him though, because it's through a medical system.
[01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:51.342]  And he goes, you need to start injecting a couple times a week into your fat, into your stomach,
[01:13:52.222 --> 01:13:53.503]  Methylcobalamin.
[01:13:53.503 --> 01:13:55.686]  Now, this is medical-grade methylcobalamin, folks.
[01:13:55.686 --> 01:13:56.647]  Exactly the same.
[01:13:56.647 --> 01:13:59.630]  When I taste it, exact same color, exact same stuff.
[01:13:59.630 --> 01:14:03.694]  Ours is produced at another facility, but this is the best stuff that they can come out with.
[01:14:03.694 --> 01:14:11.202]  And I felt, I mean, folks, I would be going on some late-night radio show or getting on an airplane late and having to work overnight.
[01:14:11.202 --> 01:14:14.686]  I would take a shot of this and get more energy from three cups of coffee.
[01:14:15.802 --> 01:14:20.325]  Now, as soon as we got Secret 12 in two years ago, I began to no longer get the prescription.
[01:14:20.325 --> 01:14:25.668]  I finally went back and got the prescription lately so that I could test it back and forth.
[01:14:25.668 --> 01:14:28.070]  Now, you absorb almost all of it when you inject it.
[01:14:28.070 --> 01:14:29.451]  Almost none of it when it hits your gut.
[01:14:29.451 --> 01:14:30.131]  That's admitted.
[01:14:30.131 --> 01:14:31.312]  The synthetic stuff they sell?
[01:14:31.312 --> 01:14:32.332]  None of it.
[01:14:32.332 --> 01:14:41.338]  This Methocobalamin, by the third-party sites, the nutraceutical experts, they're crazy about it, the doctor group developed, is amazing.
[01:14:41.338 --> 01:14:44.180]  And you take it under the tongue, Secret 12, Infowarslife.com,
[01:14:47.136 --> 01:14:51.699]  And it's just incredible what it does to mood, energy, and it's admitted, by the way.
[01:14:51.699 --> 01:15:04.589]  So what I'm saying is, when I want an energy boost, and I hate meals, but I'm gonna do this right here on air, I go to the refrigerator in my office, and see, I've had this for two weeks since I got the prescription.
[01:15:04.589 --> 01:15:07.431]  I just haven't even been using it because I got Secret 12.
[01:15:07.431 --> 01:15:11.834]  And quite frankly, this gives you a bigger kick, 30-40% more than a dose under the tongue.
[01:15:15.555 --> 01:15:18.496]  But I spray this under my tongue, it tastes exactly like ours, because it is.
[01:15:18.496 --> 01:15:21.438]  It's pure, organic, methylcobalamin.
[01:15:21.438 --> 01:15:22.458]  This is pure methylcobalamin.
[01:15:22.458 --> 01:15:23.719]  Ours is 20% this other type.
[01:15:23.719 --> 01:15:26.920]  They say it helps it upload better, whatever, you know, when you're doing it sublingually.
[01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:28.221]  I'm not the scientist.
[01:15:28.221 --> 01:15:34.344]  And during the break, I'll go stick this in my stomach, you know, pull my shirt aside and pop, you know, take the B12.
[01:15:34.344 --> 01:15:38.105]  Because, and this is what Mother Nature gave us.
[01:15:38.105 --> 01:15:39.126]  So I'm not into drugs.
[01:15:39.126 --> 01:15:40.166]  People ask, what are you on?
[01:15:40.166 --> 01:15:40.787]  I'm on vitamin B12.
[01:15:42.099 --> 01:15:45.423]  I'm on Winter Sun, the best D3 you can come out with, sublingually.
[01:15:45.423 --> 01:15:47.225]  I'm on Oxy Powder.
[01:15:47.225 --> 01:15:48.467]  I'm on Super Mel Vitality.
[01:15:48.467 --> 01:15:50.169]  I'm on what God gave us.
[01:15:50.169 --> 01:15:52.091]  I mean, that's what I'm doing.
[01:15:52.091 --> 01:15:53.453]  That's what's taking place.
[01:15:53.453 --> 01:15:54.173]  That's what's happening.
[01:15:54.173 --> 01:15:58.358]  And I tell you, one of the biggest sleeper products we've got really is Sheikra 12.
[01:15:59.986 --> 01:16:01.667]  It really is that amazing.
[01:16:01.667 --> 01:16:03.008]  Okay, I'm done plugging for the hour.
[01:16:03.008 --> 01:16:04.049]  The hats are in.
[01:16:04.049 --> 01:16:06.211]  The Secret 12's been sold out for a while.
[01:16:06.211 --> 01:16:07.251]  It's back.
[01:16:07.251 --> 01:16:08.472]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:16:08.472 --> 01:16:09.893]  Try it for yourself.
[01:16:09.893 --> 01:16:13.276]  I mean, I can take Aromate in the afternoon if I've got to go do a bunch of work.
[01:16:13.276 --> 01:16:14.717]  It doesn't really do anything.
[01:16:14.717 --> 01:16:17.759]  My receptors, my body, whatever, caffeine doesn't really do it anymore.
[01:16:17.759 --> 01:16:18.580]  That happens as you get older.
[01:16:20.802 --> 01:16:23.444]  I've got to politically get angry or exercise.
[01:16:23.444 --> 01:16:24.825]  Look, I'm going on coast-to-coast AM now.
[01:16:24.825 --> 01:16:28.288]  At 10 o'clock at night, I get on the elliptical for like 45 minutes.
[01:16:28.288 --> 01:16:30.549]  And then I go to the refrigerator and BAM!
[01:16:30.549 --> 01:16:31.010]  Vitamin B12.
[01:16:31.010 --> 01:16:32.871]  And it's better than what I used to do.
[01:16:32.871 --> 01:16:35.613]  I drink a six-pack of beer to stay up till 4 in the morning.
[01:16:35.613 --> 01:16:37.695]  For whatever reason, I have a stimulus effect on me.
[01:16:37.695 --> 01:16:39.556]  But I've replaced beer.
[01:16:39.556 --> 01:16:41.638]  Kind of like Hank Williams Jr.
[01:16:41.638 --> 01:16:46.702]  said, cornbread and iced tea have taken the place of pills and 90 proof.
[01:16:49.013 --> 01:16:50.254]  Of course, I wasn't doing that.
[01:16:50.254 --> 01:16:52.376]  I wasn't doing pills and 90 proof.
[01:16:52.376 --> 01:16:55.118]  But that's what you do to get the energy when you're exhausted.
[01:16:55.118 --> 01:17:02.003]  That's why so many country music stars and rock stars and radio hosts and news people end up being on a bunch of stuff because it's stressful, folks.
[01:17:02.932 --> 01:17:09.676]  And let's face it, all these drugs out there trigger something in you to make you have more energy at the time, or to make you feel better.
[01:17:09.676 --> 01:17:11.437]  But it makes you feel bad later.
[01:17:11.437 --> 01:17:16.680]  There's no side effects with vitamin B12, with D3, with super male vitality, things like that.
[01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:17.981]  Just, I've experienced no side effects.
[01:17:17.981 --> 01:17:20.402]  And they don't say there's side effects of vitamin B12.
[01:17:20.402 --> 01:17:22.363]  I guess it's like water.
[01:17:22.363 --> 01:17:26.466]  You know, they say if you drink three gallons of water, it can mess up your electrolytes if you drink them too quick and kill you.
[01:17:26.466 --> 01:17:27.386]  So I guess anything can kill you.
[01:17:27.386 --> 01:17:30.108]  Except maybe pure oxygen.
[01:17:30.108 --> 01:17:32.129]  Of course, I guess that can explode and blow up on you as well.
[01:17:33.567 --> 01:17:35.349]  So, very, very exciting.
[01:17:35.349 --> 01:17:36.331]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:17:36.331 --> 01:17:37.592]  I'm going to stop talking about it.
[01:17:37.592 --> 01:17:46.484]  It's just that there's so many things that Mother Nature, that God's given us, that are hiding in plain view that the system doesn't want us to go discover or find out about.
[01:17:47.503 --> 01:17:51.364]  And if you're taking synthetic vitamins, they don't do anything.
[01:17:51.364 --> 01:17:59.866]  These companies can go make, I've talked to major celebrities and people, and I've talked to their lawyers and folks about, you know, different deals and things.
[01:17:59.866 --> 01:18:08.489]  And they'll say, well, why should we do this deal and have these be expensive nitroceuticals when we could just go private label something Walmart has and then have a huge profit?
[01:18:08.489 --> 01:18:11.269]  And I said, don't you understand?
[01:18:11.269 --> 01:18:13.790]  We want to have the highest quality and have it be affordable.
[01:18:14.895 --> 01:18:22.118]  Don't you get when it works the best, even in your sociopathic brain, that then we'll dominate the market because it's the best?
[01:18:22.118 --> 01:18:23.978]  They don't think like that.
[01:18:23.978 --> 01:18:29.080]  It's just crazy how these lawyers and these people are like vampires.
[01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:40.144]  They just don't get, you sell something good, people get a great result, a great response, you then get loyal customers and everybody lives happily ever after.
[01:18:41.294 --> 01:18:47.278]  I just think it's such a great idea to screw somebody somehow or give people the least amount you can to get ahead.
[01:18:47.278 --> 01:18:50.159]  Because the devil is not a maker, folks.
[01:18:50.159 --> 01:18:51.600]  These people, it's their nature.
[01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:53.161]  They cannot change.
[01:18:53.161 --> 01:18:55.002]  They cannot change who they are.
[01:18:55.002 --> 01:18:55.383]  It's sick.
[01:18:55.383 --> 01:18:57.224]  We're going to go to break.
[01:18:57.224 --> 01:19:01.046]  I don't usually do long plugs like that, but I wanted to just, it's more of a story of what I've experienced.
[01:19:01.046 --> 01:19:02.247]  InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:19:02.247 --> 01:19:03.528]  Support our local affiliates as well.
[01:19:04.758 --> 01:19:10.921]  They're local sponsors, become a sponsor, put up a billboard, spread the word about the broadcast, get an ad in the paper, whatever.
[01:19:10.921 --> 01:19:14.003]  The war is now, people are ready to wake up like never before.
[01:19:14.003 --> 01:19:15.784]  Okay.
[01:19:15.784 --> 01:19:21.627]  I want to come back and get into Chelsea Clinton, says that now that Scalia's gone, we can enact gun control.
[01:19:21.627 --> 01:19:28.631]  Notice Prince, they announced in hours we'd have an autopsy, but not Scalia, who died at a faraway ranch in a secret society.
[01:19:29.898 --> 01:19:31.239]  Oh yeah, that was in the Washington Post.
[01:19:31.239 --> 01:19:32.600]  Nothing to see or move along.
[01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:34.181]  Obama's over in England running around.
[01:19:34.181 --> 01:19:36.062]  Quote, is America ready for a tsunami?
[01:19:36.062 --> 01:19:39.385]  Scientists reveal plans to deal with killer waves across the Pacific Northwest.
[01:19:39.385 --> 01:19:40.946]  Daily Mail, we were talking about that two days ago.
[01:19:40.946 --> 01:19:42.627]  It's now mainstream news.
[01:19:42.627 --> 01:19:45.509]  We're going to get into so much more coming up.
[01:19:45.509 --> 01:19:50.273]  We never got to this yesterday, but I want to video American signed petition to ban cash.
[01:19:50.273 --> 01:19:51.434]  Hillary!
[01:19:51.434 --> 01:19:52.755]  Oh, she's in a lot of trouble.
[01:19:52.755 --> 01:19:54.836]  In fact, I'm going to tell you about this first when we come back.
[01:19:54.836 --> 01:19:58.158]  State Department office removed Benghazi files after congressional subpoena.
[01:19:58.158 --> 01:19:58.659]  They stole them.
[01:19:59.059 --> 01:20:01.660]  Are you worried about how dangerous the world has become?
[01:20:01.660 --> 01:20:08.943]  In these days of terrorist attacks, natural disasters, or even a future collapse, you need to be medically prepared to keep your family safe.
[01:20:08.943 --> 01:20:18.147]  I'm Joe Alton, MD of store.doomandbloom.net, where you'll find an entire line of uniquely designed medical kits and supplies for when help is not on the way.

[01:20:36.772 --> 01:20:39.493]  No common core teaching methods or high-stakes testing.

[01:20:45.857 --> 01:20:49.178]  All classes are taught live online with real teachers across the country.

[01:20:55.522 --> 01:20:57.543]  That's fpeusa.org.
[01:20:59.033 --> 01:21:01.354]  Are you concerned about the Power Grid?
[01:21:01.354 --> 01:21:03.796]  About the new war on the Power Grid?
[01:21:03.796 --> 01:21:09.339]  If so, this will be the most important radio message you will ever hear, and the most valuable.
[01:21:09.339 --> 01:21:15.903]  Here, an important book revealing new and dangerous vulnerabilities of the Power Grid has just been written.
[01:21:15.903 --> 01:21:23.347]  Incredibly, the author has agreed to give away several free copies, but only for a limited time to GCN listeners.
[01:21:23.347 --> 01:21:27.690]  He simply asked that you pay $3 to cover part of the shipping and handling cost.
[01:21:28.030 --> 01:21:33.814]  Even better, if you're one of the first 17 online today, he will actually FedEx the book to you.
[01:21:33.814 --> 01:21:34.755]  Why do this?
[01:21:34.755 --> 01:21:38.618]  Why would he spend extra money and all that bother to FedEx his new book?
[01:21:38.618 --> 01:21:39.919]  The answer is simple.
[01:21:39.919 --> 01:21:44.062]  America's power grid is in grave danger, and most Americans are clueless.
[01:21:44.062 --> 01:21:50.947]  Find out what's going on behind the scenes, and why the most common question this author gets is, do you fear for your life?

[01:21:55.810 --> 01:22:00.793]  Hello, I'm Michael Reagan.
[01:22:00.793 --> 01:22:16.140]  My father, President Ronald Reagan, believed so strongly in gold that he changed gold ownership forever by bringing back physical gold to the American public, allowing gold coins to be minted and sold to US citizens just like you, starting in 1985.
[01:22:17.401 --> 01:22:24.328]  Gold ownership can help protect your financial future, especially when our national debt is spiraling out of control.
[01:22:24.328 --> 01:22:32.355]  Many smart Americans have kept their retirements from being wiped out during America's financial crisis thanks to physical gold coins.
[01:22:32.355 --> 01:22:35.018]  I strongly urge you to call the U.S.
[01:22:35.018 --> 01:22:36.259]  Money Reserve at 1-866-944-GOLD
[01:22:38.721 --> 01:22:41.665]  Or go online to usmoneyreserve.com.
[01:22:41.665 --> 01:22:47.432]  Ask for a special gold guide with new, never before released information about gold from the U.S.
[01:22:47.432 --> 01:22:48.473]  Money Reserve.
[01:22:48.473 --> 01:22:55.883]  Call 1-866-944-GOLD or go online to usmoneyreserve.com.
[01:22:55.883 --> 01:22:57.064]  I'm Michael Reagan.
[01:22:57.064 --> 01:22:57.425]  Thank you.
[01:22:58.069 --> 01:23:01.371]  The final phase of extermination is set to commence now.
[01:23:01.371 --> 01:23:06.855]  And as population die-off becomes evident, you know it is the time of punishment in all that is written.
[01:23:06.855 --> 01:23:13.080]  The cover for mass die-off is evolution and global warming frauds, also used as false proof of their Christ.
[01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:16.722]  They are from the lines that were disinherited 2,000 years ago.

[01:23:59.194 --> 01:23:59.941]  Yeah.
[01:24:05.803 --> 01:24:10.226]  Alright, the broadcast is an hour and 24 minutes in and I have got to get to more of the news.
[01:24:10.226 --> 01:24:13.709]  We've got so many special reports, so much breaking intel.
[01:24:13.709 --> 01:24:21.354]  What a wild first hour though with Mancow, who on record did interview Prince and all these other people.
[01:24:21.354 --> 01:24:23.635]  They're telling him about satanic rituals and all the rest of it.
[01:24:23.635 --> 01:24:26.998]  It's just crazy that Prince wouldn't be part of.
[01:24:26.998 --> 01:24:30.380]  It's just wild to know how out of control these elites are.
[01:24:33.186 --> 01:24:36.307]  But before I go any further, let me hit this piece of news.
[01:24:36.307 --> 01:24:44.308]  This is out of the Washington Free Beacon.
[01:24:44.308 --> 01:24:51.729]  The headline should read that they ran off and hit him to refuse the subpoena and dodge the subpoena.
[01:24:51.729 --> 01:24:53.430]  That's a crime in and of itself.
[01:24:53.430 --> 01:25:00.231]  She did stuff thousands of times worse than Petraeus, but nothing has been done to her.
[01:25:00.231 --> 01:25:00.451]  But,
[01:25:01.567 --> 01:25:04.549]  Congressman Jones and others are in the Hill newspaper today.
[01:25:04.549 --> 01:25:10.733]  Lawmakers optimistic secret 9-11 pages will soon see release.
[01:25:10.733 --> 01:25:21.099]  But first, let's get into someone licking her lips, licking her chops like the wolf let in to a nice little pen full of baby sheep.
[01:25:21.099 --> 01:25:23.040]  That's Chelsea, the next generation.
[01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:25.542]  You have Kim Jong-un, the next generation in North Korea.
[01:25:25.542 --> 01:25:28.644]  Here we have Chelsea, the next vampire pup.
[01:25:29.304 --> 01:25:32.045]  Turned loose on the quarry.
[01:25:32.045 --> 01:25:33.725]  Chelsea Clinton, there's video.
[01:25:33.725 --> 01:25:38.667]  She says, now that Scalia's gone, we can enact gun control while campaigning for her mother recently.
[01:25:38.667 --> 01:25:47.009]  Chelsea Clinton admitted that the left is planning to use the Supreme Court to enact greater gun control if a Democrat wins the presidency, which they deny.
[01:25:47.009 --> 01:25:50.450]  Of course, they want to do.
[01:25:50.450 --> 01:25:52.430]  Let's go ahead and go to that clip.
[01:25:52.430 --> 01:25:57.952]  It matters to me that my mom also recognizes the role the Supreme Court has when it comes to gun control.
[01:25:58.999 --> 01:26:05.764]  With Justice Scalia on the bench, one of the few areas where the court actually had an inconsistent record relates to gun control.
[01:26:05.764 --> 01:26:14.151]  Sometimes the court upheld local and state gun control measures as being compliant with the Second Amendment, and sometimes the court struck them down.
[01:26:14.151 --> 01:26:24.679]  So if you listen to Moms Demand Action and the Brady Campaign, and the major efforts pushing for smart, sensible, and enforceable gun control across our country,
[01:26:25.699 --> 01:26:28.781]  I have armed guards, you have nothing sensible.
[01:26:34.228 --> 01:26:36.390]  Lower your weapons, we mean no harm, love you.
[01:26:36.390 --> 01:26:37.371]  Lay down your arms, we come in peace.
[01:26:37.371 --> 01:26:37.631]  A mother.
[01:26:37.631 --> 01:26:38.772]  Her mother reportedly kept her.
[01:26:38.772 --> 01:26:39.032]  Kept her.
[01:26:59.372 --> 01:27:02.496]  Aborted the boys as her little set piece.
[01:27:02.496 --> 01:27:03.918]  But here's the deal.
[01:27:03.918 --> 01:27:06.362]  It's not even Clinton's daughter.
[01:27:06.362 --> 01:27:07.804]  It's Webster Hubble's daughter.
[01:27:07.804 --> 01:27:11.749]  She looks just like him, but I have that from the insiders inside their campaign.
[01:27:17.011 --> 01:27:19.772]  This is the type of garbage that we're dealing with.
[01:27:19.772 --> 01:27:22.413]  Another political person preying on us.
[01:27:22.413 --> 01:27:26.794]  When their kids go to private school, they have dozens and dozens of armed guards there in D.C.
[01:27:26.794 --> 01:27:27.474]  at each school.
[01:27:27.474 --> 01:27:28.414]  That's in the news.
[01:27:28.414 --> 01:27:31.895]  They live on armed guards and armored fortresses and guns protect them.
[01:27:31.895 --> 01:27:37.597]  But they look at the average citizen and say, we need sensible gun control, which means Chicago, New York, or D.C.
[01:27:37.597 --> 01:27:38.437]  total gun ban.
[01:27:40.069 --> 01:27:49.237]  The Supreme Court Justice that Obama's nominated is on record as the guy that filed the briefs for the government to overturn D.C.
[01:27:49.237 --> 01:27:51.559]  Heller and have total gun ban.
[01:27:51.559 --> 01:27:59.365]  Reasonable gun control means you're totally disarmed, living as a slave under this woman.
[01:27:59.365 --> 01:28:01.026]  And because, I mean, look at these weak
[01:28:02.020 --> 01:28:08.684]  Goofy people reading scripts, and then we're ruled by these sloths.
[01:28:08.684 --> 01:28:13.607]  By Webster Hubble's sloth daughter, born with a gold spoon in her mouth.
[01:28:13.607 --> 01:28:15.508]  I mean, look at the royal family of England.
[01:28:15.508 --> 01:28:18.350]  Aren't even German, aren't even English.
[01:28:18.350 --> 01:28:21.492]  They're Transylvanian, other than against people from Romania or Hungary, but I mean, you know.
[01:28:22.731 --> 01:28:25.192]  Vlad the Impaler's brood.
[01:28:25.192 --> 01:28:26.372]  The Queen turns 90.
[01:28:26.372 --> 01:28:28.692]  Report values British monarchy at 84 billion.
[01:28:28.692 --> 01:28:29.913]  It's in the tens of trillions.
[01:28:29.913 --> 01:28:33.113]  They're the biggest landowners in the world.
[01:28:33.113 --> 01:28:35.394]  Was it 600 million acres last time I checked?
[01:28:35.394 --> 01:28:36.614]  Oil companies, you name it.
[01:28:36.614 --> 01:28:38.814]  Their wealth's a state secret.
[01:28:38.814 --> 01:28:46.116]  Happy birthday, your majesty Obama!
[01:28:46.116 --> 01:28:47.956]  Over there, this is disgusting.
[01:28:47.956 --> 01:28:50.737]  These people, the only nationalism Brits are allowed to have
[01:28:51.618 --> 01:28:56.641]  Or any folks in the UK is worshipping this alien group.
[01:28:56.641 --> 01:29:09.227]  And now, even the Liberal Mayor says, you know, that Obama's a Kenyan, and so he thinks of Britain as colonial, so he wants the EU to be a colonial power over the UK, and they're calling him racist.
[01:29:09.227 --> 01:29:10.148]  No!
[01:29:10.148 --> 01:29:15.491]  Globalism is 2.0 colonialism run by megabanks.
[01:29:15.491 --> 01:29:19.433]  And there's no flag to attack, because they're constantly, you know, shifting position.
[01:29:20.626 --> 01:29:22.008]  It's 21st century warfare.
[01:29:22.008 --> 01:29:23.049]  And the mayor's absolutely right.
[01:29:23.049 --> 01:29:25.893]  In fact, that's the top headline on RUDD's.
[01:29:25.893 --> 01:29:26.894]  We can punch it up.
[01:29:26.894 --> 01:29:32.301]  London mayor rips Kenyan Obama ancestral dislike for Brit Empire.
[01:29:32.301 --> 01:29:32.882]  That's a fact.
[01:29:32.882 --> 01:29:38.649]  But see, because he's being a real intellectual and being a nationalist, even though he's a liberal, that's not allowed.
[01:29:40.277 --> 01:29:43.880]  Even the liberals in England are understanding they're now being conquered by the EU.
[01:29:43.880 --> 01:29:47.882]  Already conquered by Vlad the Impaler's little rotten group of demons.
[01:29:47.882 --> 01:29:49.263]  We're on the march.
[01:29:49.263 --> 01:29:50.884]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:50.884 --> 01:29:54.467]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.031 --> 01:30:03.436]  Is the British government more worried about transgender bathrooms than ISIS?
[01:30:03.436 --> 01:30:10.805]  This week it emerged that ISIS was plotting to attack tourist beaches across Europe by posing as vendors and placing bombs under sunbeds.
[01:30:10.805 --> 01:30:17.934]  Meanwhile in North Carolina, people are being required by a new law to use public bathrooms that correspond with their biological gender.
[01:30:18.174 --> 01:30:24.824]  So, which grave threat to the Brits traveling overseas did the British Foreign Office decide to warn its citizens about?
[01:30:24.824 --> 01:30:33.296]  That's right, they wanted travelers to be aware of the controversial new bathroom laws in North Carolina and Mississippi before visiting the U.S.
[01:30:33.616 --> 01:30:39.741]  Thirty British citizens were slaughtered on a beach by ISIS jihadists in Tunisia less than a year ago.
[01:30:39.741 --> 01:30:43.964]  ISIS frequently calls for the execution of members of the LGBT community.
[01:30:43.964 --> 01:30:50.510]  The Foreign Office issues a warning about bathroom laws, yet ignores the terror threat to attack tourist beaches.
[01:30:50.510 --> 01:30:54.213]  For more on the absurdity, visit InfoWars.com right now.
[01:30:58.467 --> 01:31:00.548]  Brain Force, it's completely different.
[01:31:00.548 --> 01:31:01.768]  Try a bottle of it.
[01:31:01.768 --> 01:31:03.368]  Rob Dew joins us.
[01:31:03.368 --> 01:31:06.489]  You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours.
[01:31:06.489 --> 01:31:07.530]  Tell us what Brain Force did.
[01:31:07.530 --> 01:31:08.510]  I'd been working all day.
[01:31:08.510 --> 01:31:11.011]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[01:31:11.011 --> 01:31:12.431]  I get in here at 830.
[01:31:12.431 --> 01:31:14.331]  I was kind of run down.
[01:31:14.331 --> 01:31:16.052]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it.
[01:31:16.252 --> 01:31:18.153]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[01:31:18.153 --> 01:31:19.974]  I got my bottle of Brain Force right there.
[01:31:19.974 --> 01:31:21.035]  I popped two of them.
[01:31:21.035 --> 01:31:25.197]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like everything just kind of clears up.
[01:31:25.197 --> 01:31:26.758]  It's got four and a half stars.
[01:31:26.758 --> 01:31:28.099]  People really love it.
[01:31:28.099 --> 01:31:28.699]  Read about it.
[01:31:28.699 --> 01:31:32.541]  Find out why third party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise.
[01:31:32.541 --> 01:31:37.804]  Because it really does have the best organic based systems that will blow your socks off.
[01:31:38.004 --> 01:31:42.026]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without Brain Force.
[01:31:42.026 --> 01:31:48.189]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brain Force and came in.
[01:31:48.189 --> 01:31:54.092]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:31:58.240 --> 01:31:59.040]  Hey, everyone!
[01:31:59.040 --> 01:32:01.341]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[01:32:01.341 --> 01:32:05.183]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[01:32:05.183 --> 01:32:07.264]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[01:32:07.264 --> 01:32:17.528]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[01:32:17.528 --> 01:32:23.511]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[01:32:23.991 --> 01:32:44.740]  If you're dealing with a health challenge, or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino acids it needs to do its healing work, you need to check out InfoWarsTeam.com.

[01:32:46.701 --> 01:32:47.101]  Head over to
[01:32:47.321 --> 01:32:49.143]  Infowarsteam.com.
[01:32:49.143 --> 01:32:50.985]  Your body will be very grateful.
[01:32:50.985 --> 01:32:54.048]  On the web at Infowarsteam.com.
[01:32:54.048 --> 01:32:55.810]  That's Infowarsteam.com.
[01:33:12.273 --> 01:33:17.134]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[01:33:17.134 --> 01:33:20.215]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:20.215 --> 01:33:25.136]  I love the lyrics of this song.
[01:33:25.136 --> 01:33:28.177]  Too many times it happens so fast.
[01:33:28.177 --> 01:33:33.998]  You trade your passion for glory.
[01:33:33.998 --> 01:33:36.738]  Passion is glory.
[01:33:36.738 --> 01:33:39.199]  People trade their passion for false glory.
[01:33:40.742 --> 01:33:58.254]  The whole New World Order system is run by magicians to sell you on worshipping their false creation and not worshipping the God that made the real universe.
[01:33:58.254 --> 01:34:10.343]  And the movement to empower humanity is rapidly reaching the top of the geopolitical system intellectually.
[01:34:12.287 --> 01:34:19.652]  But from there, it is only a launchpad.
[01:34:19.652 --> 01:34:25.297]  The fight to survive is the fight to innovate.
[01:34:25.297 --> 01:34:39.387]  The fight to survive is to believe on lifting others up, but not following the counterfeit to lift others up by putting them on a government reservation and having them live like a caged animal.
[01:34:42.076 --> 01:34:50.882]  But to build systems that allow the true testing of the man and woman.
[01:34:50.882 --> 01:35:02.090]  And to reward the development and expansion of traits that will turn the human spirit loose.
[01:35:02.090 --> 01:35:04.392]  We are so close, my friends.
[01:35:04.392 --> 01:35:06.754]  On every front.
[01:35:06.754 --> 01:35:10.737]  The Great Awakening to eclipse all others.
[01:35:11.730 --> 01:35:13.811]  It's about to begin.
[01:35:13.811 --> 01:35:19.595]  The enemy is going to throw everything they've got at free humanity.
[01:35:19.595 --> 01:35:21.496]  It's gonna look bad.
[01:35:21.496 --> 01:35:26.339]  They're gonna think we're losing.
[01:35:26.339 --> 01:35:35.505]  But clichés are clichés because they're true.
[01:35:35.505 --> 01:35:38.547]  It's always darkest before the dawn.
[01:35:38.547 --> 01:35:40.689]  And when that sun cuts through those clouds,
[01:35:42.981 --> 01:35:55.845]  When the light streams out incinerating the phantoms of evil, the true dawn of humanity's mission will be revealed.
[01:35:55.845 --> 01:36:02.246]  And everything the enemy does is to block that out.
[01:36:02.246 --> 01:36:04.107]  This is the boot camp.
[01:36:04.107 --> 01:36:06.127]  This is the test.
[01:36:06.127 --> 01:36:08.448]  You're living it right now.
[01:36:08.448 --> 01:36:09.608]  What's the enemy telling you?
[01:36:09.608 --> 01:36:11.689]  Movies like Avatar, all the rest of it.
[01:36:12.790 --> 01:36:15.091]  It's a simulation.
[01:36:15.091 --> 01:36:16.952]  Spirit's real.
[01:36:16.952 --> 01:36:20.313]  Jacked into these bodies.
[01:36:20.313 --> 01:36:24.014]  The eye has not seen, the ear has not heard.
[01:36:24.014 --> 01:36:27.176]  God has in store for us.
[01:36:27.176 --> 01:36:34.318]  And I have seen, as many others have seen, beyond the enemy's projection.
[01:36:34.318 --> 01:36:37.039]  I've seen reality.
[01:36:37.039 --> 01:36:38.500]  So fantastic.
[01:36:38.500 --> 01:36:39.580]  So deep.
[01:36:39.580 --> 01:36:40.821]  So unfathomable.
[01:36:43.274 --> 01:36:47.015]  That I have been irrevocably changed.
[01:36:47.015 --> 01:36:50.637]  And the truth is, the enemy is scared to death.
[01:36:50.637 --> 01:36:55.919]  More and more people are seeing through the veil to the other side.
[01:36:55.919 --> 01:36:57.439]  They're coming out of Plato's Cave.
[01:36:57.439 --> 01:36:59.000]  It's an amazing time to be alive.
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:00.481]  Mark Moreno is not picking up.
[01:37:00.481 --> 01:37:01.121]  He's a great guy.
[01:37:01.121 --> 01:37:01.661]  Awesome guy.
[01:37:01.661 --> 01:37:02.441]  Very busy on Earth Day.
[01:37:02.441 --> 01:37:04.862]  We may have gotten some time zones mixed up.
[01:37:04.862 --> 01:37:06.703]  We just got him, I'm told?
[01:37:06.703 --> 01:37:07.763]  That is awesome!
[01:37:07.763 --> 01:37:08.864]  Well, that was perfect timing!
[01:37:11.018 --> 01:37:25.683]  You know, I don't want to just sit up here and ask the questions and rattle on and interrupt and, you know, kind of let this interview just blow over in the next 25 minutes to the next subject.
[01:37:25.683 --> 01:37:38.627]  What Mark Moreno is doing with Lord Monckton and others is attacking at the root the absolute fount, the fountainhead, the birthplace
[01:37:40.137 --> 01:37:43.900]  The engine, the progenitor of all our problems.
[01:37:43.900 --> 01:37:52.587]  If you understand the environmentalist, the eugenicist, the Earth Day cultist, when you understand them, you understand everything.
[01:37:52.587 --> 01:37:53.809]  They want to control the resources.
[01:37:53.809 --> 01:37:55.230]  They want to say who can have a car.
[01:37:55.230 --> 01:37:56.811]  They want to say where you can go, what you can do.
[01:37:56.811 --> 01:38:00.794]  They want to monitor everything with carbon taxes that they themselves profit from.
[01:38:00.794 --> 01:38:07.240]  They want to tell you by 2013, sea levels are going to rise and the ice caps are going to be gone, but they only get bigger.
[01:38:08.677 --> 01:38:13.479]  They want to have a UN vote that the sun doesn't affect climate.
[01:38:13.479 --> 01:38:33.645]  And now, as Mark Moreno and countless others have warned, but he's been the tip of the spear, I've got a stack of news articles here today, in the Washington Post, Washington Times, you name it, where with straight face, Bill Nye tells Mark Moreno, yeah, we need to look at arresting people for their speech, that's right.
[01:38:33.645 --> 01:38:38.147]  Democratic AGs, climate change groups, colluded on prosecuting dissenters, email shows.
[01:38:39.721 --> 01:38:49.765]  Prosecuting people who say climate change is completely normal, the only constant, and humans barely contribute.
[01:38:49.765 --> 01:38:56.508]  And what does paying Al Gore billions in carbon taxes and Lord Rothschild do?
[01:38:56.508 --> 01:39:00.069]  Global warming has made the weather better for most of the U.S., but don't get used to it.
[01:39:00.069 --> 01:39:03.451]  Studies says all this garbage.
[01:39:03.451 --> 01:39:04.171]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[01:39:05.674 --> 01:39:08.296]  The man that heads up climatedepot.com.
[01:39:08.296 --> 01:39:10.117]  Mark Moreno joins us.
[01:39:10.117 --> 01:39:13.319]  The guy that's been going to all these big UN conferences.
[01:39:13.319 --> 01:39:21.104]  Where a global government is going to regulate and control everything you do and selectively shut down power plants and industries they don't control.
[01:39:21.104 --> 01:39:22.345]  China doesn't have to make any cuts.
[01:39:22.345 --> 01:39:23.225]  India doesn't have to make cuts.
[01:39:23.225 --> 01:39:25.046]  That alone should kill all this.
[01:39:25.046 --> 01:39:30.510]  Their answer is to lie with a bald face and say not one scientist disagrees with us.
[01:39:32.199 --> 01:39:37.602]  And we're going to put you in prison if you disagree, when almost all the scientists say it's pure bull.
[01:39:37.602 --> 01:39:38.803]  It's incredible.
[01:39:38.803 --> 01:39:43.005]  Mark Moreno, it's Earth Day, so much is going on.
[01:39:43.005 --> 01:39:44.546]  They have gotten really bold.
[01:39:44.546 --> 01:39:47.367]  Is it because they're desperate that their lives are imploding?
[01:39:47.367 --> 01:39:52.250]  I mean, we've got their internal emails where they're hiding the decline all over the world, you know, organizing this.
[01:39:53.576 --> 01:39:56.059]  Is it desperation or is it out of arrogance?
[01:39:56.059 --> 01:40:00.384]  Because they're all over the news saying just arrest anybody they disagree with.
[01:40:00.384 --> 01:40:08.013]  In fact, they name you as someone they want to indict, Mark Moreno, former top advisor to Senator Inhofe, advisor to Congress.
[01:40:08.013 --> 01:40:09.935]  How dare you, sir?
[01:40:09.935 --> 01:40:14.040]  How dare you not want to tax Western civilization?
[01:40:15.691 --> 01:40:17.332]  Well, thanks for having me on, Alex.
[01:40:17.332 --> 01:40:19.033]  When I was in Paris, we talked about this.
[01:40:19.033 --> 01:40:21.414]  You interviewed me live from Paris.
[01:40:21.414 --> 01:40:33.060]  They had my wanted posters all over the UN Climate Summit in Paris, with my mug shot and a wanted sign for being a, quote, climate criminal, unquote.
[01:40:33.060 --> 01:40:40.064]  And that's followed by Senator Whitehouse of Rhode Island calling for organized crime, racketeering charges against climate skeptics.
[01:40:40.064 --> 01:40:43.445]  It's calling after Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[01:40:43.445 --> 01:40:44.686]  has called to jail
[01:40:45.325 --> 01:40:54.149]  Climate skeptics for treason and put him at the Hague with all the other war criminals, in his words, with three square meals in a cot with all the other war criminals.
[01:40:54.149 --> 01:40:56.491]  And now, as you mentioned, Bill Nye is joining it.
[01:40:56.491 --> 01:41:00.213]  You're asking me if it's arrogance or if it's desperation.
[01:41:00.213 --> 01:41:00.933]  Here's the problem.
[01:41:00.933 --> 01:41:03.954]  I don't think they're that desperate, and here's why.
[01:41:03.954 --> 01:41:08.857]  They have many important ways are winning below the radar.
[01:41:08.857 --> 01:41:09.697]  And here's what I mean by that.
[01:41:09.697 --> 01:41:09.857]  In the 1990s,
[01:41:12.141 --> 01:41:16.605]  The biggest atrocity performed was a Republican president when it comes to U.S.
[01:41:16.605 --> 01:41:19.007]  sovereignty, and it was by George H.W.
[01:41:19.007 --> 01:41:19.368]  Bush.
[01:41:19.368 --> 01:41:21.890]  He attended the Rio Earth Summit.
[01:41:21.890 --> 01:41:30.379]  His then-advisor was an alleged conservative named John Sununu, who urged everyone, oh, we're going to do this treaty, but it won't be binding, and don't worry, don't worry.
[01:41:30.379 --> 01:41:33.321]  We signed on to that treaty, and the Senate ratified the 1992 Rio Earth Treaty.
[01:41:35.558 --> 01:41:38.240]  And that was the basis for everything we see today.
[01:41:38.240 --> 01:41:43.663]  That is the reason President Obama is now claiming he doesn't have to ratify this treaty.
[01:41:43.663 --> 01:41:51.628]  We're living with a Republican president's legacy now, almost 25 years later, that has put the United States... This is Agenda 21.
[01:41:51.628 --> 01:41:59.532]  It starts with our toilets, and our light bulbs, and our cars, and now just everything under regulations that just come out of nowhere.
[01:41:59.532 --> 01:42:00.713]  Yeah, and so what they've done
[01:42:02.121 --> 01:42:08.386]  With President Bush signing on, that led to the Kyoto Protocol, the next UN Treaty, that led to a whole series of domestic events.
[01:42:08.386 --> 01:42:11.828]  But they failed on cap-and-trade like five times.
[01:42:11.828 --> 01:42:14.691]  2003, 2005, 2008, 2009, 2008.
[01:42:14.691 --> 01:42:15.751]  They just kept failing.
[01:42:15.751 --> 01:42:19.314]  Every time they tried to pass a climate bill, Capitol Hill would be shut down.
[01:42:19.314 --> 01:42:21.776]  Democratic congressmen who voted for the bill would go home.
[01:42:21.776 --> 01:42:23.378]  They'd be mocked and ridiculed.
[01:42:23.378 --> 01:42:24.999]  They'd say they won't vote again.
[01:42:24.999 --> 01:42:28.942]  The public couldn't have been more loud in saying they didn't want these.
[01:42:29.485 --> 01:42:45.198]  They never got carbon taxes, the UN treaties were never ratified, but what President Obama did, and it's transformational, he's surpassed LBJ, he's now rivaling only Franklin Delano Roosevelt in transforming America, in terms of expanding big government.
[01:42:45.198 --> 01:42:48.241]  Franklin Roosevelt had his New Deal and Supreme Court packing.
[01:42:48.241 --> 01:42:57.709]  But Mark, isn't the real racketeering people like Pecharia, whose son literally had the coal plant transferred from England, the last one,
[01:42:58.129 --> 01:43:03.033]  In that area of Sheffield to India that he owned and ran and he had to resign because of it.
[01:43:03.033 --> 01:43:14.301]  The real racketeering is them saying we've got to pay Al Gore and the Chicago mercantile and Obama that's part owner every time we engage in any human activity and pay them carbon indulgences.
[01:43:14.301 --> 01:43:16.202]  And the Pope's running around involved.
[01:43:16.202 --> 01:43:18.864]  I mean, this is over the top.
[01:43:18.864 --> 01:43:19.405]  Yeah, it is.
[01:43:19.405 --> 01:43:20.205]  And this is all part of it.
[01:43:20.205 --> 01:43:21.106]  But here's what I'm saying.
[01:43:21.106 --> 01:43:22.627]  They're winning in this important respect.
[01:43:23.092 --> 01:43:30.858]  We have now domestic climate regulations without a vote of Congress under executive order, and now we have, today, President Obama on Earth Day is signing the U.S.
[01:43:30.858 --> 01:43:31.579]  onto this U.N.
[01:43:31.579 --> 01:43:32.900]  Climate Paris Treaty.
[01:43:32.900 --> 01:43:44.570]  We are going to have a new international regulation, so we are covered both domestically, internationally, and we have presidential candidates, and whether you like them or hate them, whatever you think, they're not making this a priority.
[01:43:44.570 --> 01:43:47.152]  That's right, Donald Trump needs to talk about climate.
[01:43:47.152 --> 01:43:48.333]  Ted Cruz talking about it.
[01:43:49.093 --> 01:43:59.219]  Donald Trump needs to come out, obviously, and say, look, we got TPP, Secret Deal, all these other environmental deals, Paris UN deals, to shut off our power plants, but not other countries' power plants.
[01:43:59.219 --> 01:43:59.940]  That's wrong.
[01:43:59.940 --> 01:44:02.361]  That's even bigger than his tariff deal with the Chinese.
[01:44:02.361 --> 01:44:02.682]  I agree.
[01:44:02.682 --> 01:44:06.744]  In fact, I'm going to get that message to Paul and to Roger.
[01:44:06.744 --> 01:44:09.346]  I'm going to make sure that message gets to them, because it's crazy.
[01:44:09.346 --> 01:44:11.567]  I mean, I literally say stuff, hey, you ought to push this.
[01:44:11.567 --> 01:44:12.308]  They get it to Trump.
[01:44:12.308 --> 01:44:13.448]  He looks at it and talks about it.
[01:44:13.448 --> 01:44:15.690]  So the good thing about Trump is he will actually listen.
[01:44:16.909 --> 01:44:18.689]  No, I agree, but here's the thing.
[01:44:18.689 --> 01:44:21.310]  They need to actually have a specific agenda.
[01:44:21.310 --> 01:44:23.590]  They need to defund the United Nations Climate Panel.
[01:44:23.590 --> 01:44:26.171]  There's actually been proposals in Congress that haven't gone anywhere.
[01:44:26.171 --> 01:44:28.031]  A couple of Republican Congressmen have pushed it.
[01:44:28.031 --> 01:44:32.432]  They need to withdraw from the UN Climate Treaty and they need to reverse President Obama.
[01:44:32.432 --> 01:44:40.974]  A simple three-point plan to start with and that should be every stump speech of every presidential candidate running to oppose this agenda.
[01:44:40.974 --> 01:44:41.614]  The problem is
[01:44:42.054 --> 01:44:46.417]  The public isn't even aware that all the bills that they've defeated in the past, it doesn't matter.
[01:44:46.417 --> 01:44:48.899]  We now have climate bills through the EPA.
[01:44:48.899 --> 01:44:51.560]  We now have UN treaty without Senate ratification.
[01:44:51.560 --> 01:44:54.002]  And I think the other side is excited.
[01:44:54.002 --> 01:45:00.987]  I think they think if they can get Hillary elected, that it's going to be four more or eight more years before you can even revisit this.
[01:45:01.527 --> 01:45:03.248]  Well, they're running away with it worldwide.
[01:45:03.248 --> 01:45:05.430]  They're just installing a dictatorship.
[01:45:05.430 --> 01:45:07.811]  Well, then shouldn't we call in Congress for impeachment?
[01:45:07.811 --> 01:45:12.534]  Just like Obama has open borders, or he's shutting off our coal plants, saying he wants to bankrupt them?
[01:45:12.534 --> 01:45:15.856]  I think that we need to make, we need to raise this issue at the highest profile.
[01:45:15.856 --> 01:45:16.637]  There is no issue.
[01:45:16.637 --> 01:45:25.863]  In fact, if you look, actually, John Coleman, who's going to be appearing in movie theaters with, he introduces our film, The Climate Hustle, on May 2nd for the showing.
[01:45:25.863 --> 01:45:30.305]  His USA Today, he's got an op-ed in there today, and he lays it out there.
[01:45:30.305 --> 01:45:31.026]  This is not
[01:45:31.624 --> 01:45:36.128]  This has nothing to do with science, environmental policy, and nothing to do with sea level rise.
[01:45:36.128 --> 01:45:45.177]  The UN climate chief has actually said that she seeks a quote, centralized transformation that will make the life on this planet very different for everyone.
[01:45:45.177 --> 01:45:48.460]  Absolutely, a global government taxing all carbon activity.
[01:45:48.460 --> 01:45:53.004]  Here's USA Today article we're going to get John Coleman on sometime next week, founder of the Weather Channel.
[01:45:53.004 --> 01:45:54.666]  He's a big listener, big patriot.
[01:45:54.666 --> 01:45:56.708]  Get politics out of climate debate.
[01:45:57.128 --> 01:45:58.329]  Opposing view.
[01:45:58.329 --> 01:46:00.771]  So at least USA Today showed an opposing view.
[01:46:00.771 --> 01:46:07.696]  As you know more and more, Mark, on CNN, MSNBC, they're not even showing opposing views anymore.
[01:46:07.696 --> 01:46:09.677]  No, in fact, they won't even publish articles.
[01:46:09.677 --> 01:46:10.938]  They won't put letters to the editors.
[01:46:11.477 --> 01:46:11.878]  I think so.
[01:46:28.078 --> 01:46:30.859]  They're now talking about every bad weather event.
[01:46:30.859 --> 01:46:38.220]  If a flood happens in New Jersey, they're going to go after energy companies now and try to get huge settlements.
[01:46:38.220 --> 01:46:40.041]  Talk about shakedowns!
[01:46:40.041 --> 01:46:44.962]  But it's going to be select insurance, select energy companies, not part of the cabal.
[01:46:44.962 --> 01:46:49.523]  Just like GE got all the waivers, they could keep their coal power plants, nobody else could.
[01:46:49.523 --> 01:46:55.184]  Let's play a clip of Bill Nye, folks, that Mark Morano just interviewed last week, saying, no, we should look at going after people.
[01:46:55.444 --> 01:47:02.348]  And then he uses Enron, which came up with the carbon scam in the late 80s with Al Gore!
[01:47:02.348 --> 01:47:04.009]  The irony could not be sicker.
[01:47:04.009 --> 01:47:05.149]  Here it is.
[01:47:05.149 --> 01:47:11.773]  We interviewed Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the environmentalist, here at the People's Climate March in 2014, September.
[01:47:11.773 --> 01:47:19.857]  He said that the climate deniers, his word, energy CEOs, belong at the Hague with three square meals and a cot with all the other war criminals.
[01:47:20.919 --> 01:47:21.679]  What is your thought on that?
[01:47:21.679 --> 01:47:26.821]  Do you think some of the rhetoric on your side, as I'm sure both sides, but some of the rhetoric on your side gets too carried away?
[01:47:26.821 --> 01:47:30.683]  I mean, what's your thought on jailing skeptics as war criminals?
[01:47:30.683 --> 01:47:32.163]  We'll see what happens.
[01:47:32.163 --> 01:47:36.685]  Was it appropriate to jail the guys from Enron?
[01:47:36.685 --> 01:47:37.305]  Okay, right?
[01:47:37.305 --> 01:47:39.506]  So we'll see what happens.
[01:47:39.506 --> 01:47:47.489]  Was it appropriate to jail people from the cigarette industry who insisted that this addictive product was not addictive and so on?
[01:47:47.489 --> 01:47:48.089]  And you think about
[01:47:49.039 --> 01:48:03.271]  In these cases, for me as a taxpayer and voter, the doubting, the introduction of this extreme doubt, when you go with extreme doubt, is affecting my quality of life as a public citizen.
[01:48:03.271 --> 01:48:09.757]  So I can see where people are very concerned about this and are pursuing criminal investigations as well as
[01:48:12.265 --> 01:48:14.290]  As well as engaging in discussions like this.
[01:48:14.290 --> 01:48:16.354]  You know what's scary?
[01:48:16.354 --> 01:48:19.601]  He gives the perfect canned push they've had for five years.
[01:48:20.644 --> 01:48:22.525]  Uh, saying they want to arrest people.
[01:48:22.525 --> 01:48:24.787]  And now they're trying to do it in Europe, they're trying to do it here.
[01:48:24.787 --> 01:48:25.767]  They mean business, folks.
[01:48:25.767 --> 01:48:27.428]  These people are so dangerous.
[01:48:27.428 --> 01:48:30.931]  Now, here's Obama saying, you can build a coal-powered plant, but we will bankrupt you.
[01:48:30.931 --> 01:48:32.572]  We will raise the tax.
[01:48:32.572 --> 01:48:34.233]  Again, they all just moved to Mexico.
[01:48:34.233 --> 01:48:37.294]  That's why Ford and everybody's going to Mexico.
[01:48:37.294 --> 01:48:49.142]  Because you can't build here, because we have some of the most expensive energy in the world, except for Spain, who's going completely bankrupt by design because of the carbon taxes, and Australia.
[01:48:50.626 --> 01:48:54.749]  Let's play this clip and get Mark Moreno from ClimateHustle.org's take on it.
[01:48:54.749 --> 01:48:56.670]  Here's Obama.
[01:48:56.670 --> 01:48:59.692]  So if somebody wants to build a coal-powered plant, they can.
[01:48:59.692 --> 01:49:08.538]  It's just that it will bankrupt them because they're going to be charged a huge sum for all that greenhouse gas that's being emitted.
[01:49:08.538 --> 01:49:10.179]  So discriminatory.
[01:49:10.179 --> 01:49:16.423]  America has the highest regulations and taxes and garbage of anybody basically out there now of any major country.
[01:49:16.423 --> 01:49:19.785]  How is it not discriminatory that we're supposed to shut down but they're not, Mark?
[01:49:21.584 --> 01:49:22.664]  That's exactly right.
[01:49:22.664 --> 01:49:26.606]  In fact, Obama, that's one campaign promise he has kept.
[01:49:26.606 --> 01:49:32.268]  And, you know, we had the largest private coal company in the world declare bankruptcy about last week or ten days ago.
[01:49:32.268 --> 01:49:38.411]  And now, I believe it was the Sierra Club, just yesterday, the day before, has come out and now they're opposed to all natural gas.
[01:49:39.821 --> 01:49:47.367]  Is an insidious agenda that basically says any energy that works, that powers our economy and our nation has to be banned.
[01:49:47.367 --> 01:49:50.910]  And we're now going to mandate energy that's not ready for prime time.
[01:49:50.910 --> 01:49:55.995]  Solar, wind, and other so-called... And that's all special deals with their cronies to get the boondoggles.
[01:49:55.995 --> 01:49:58.557]  The reason I get so upset about this, I study military history.
[01:49:58.937 --> 01:50:05.218]  When you blow the energy bases, that's when you're killing the country, and they are literally turning us off.
[01:50:05.218 --> 01:50:11.960]  They are literally flipping the lights off, giggling and laughing at us, and admitting it's cloward and pivot, Mark Moreno.
[01:50:11.960 --> 01:50:20.622]  Yeah, in 1975, John Holdren wrote an op-ed, Obama's current science advisor, saying one of the hazards of a free society was energy that's too plentiful.
[01:50:21.232 --> 01:50:28.017]  I mean, this is their ideology, and it's this worldview that humans are a parasite.
[01:50:28.017 --> 01:50:30.739]  They've actually said that phrase.
[01:50:30.739 --> 01:50:35.643]  They've been compared by David Suzuki in Canada, one of the lead environmentalists.
[01:50:37.304 --> 01:50:38.184]  Yeah, maggots.
[01:50:38.184 --> 01:50:39.625]  And a lot of people have called them parasites.
[01:50:39.625 --> 01:50:42.026]  And this is how they view human development.
[01:50:42.026 --> 01:50:42.506]  You know what?
[01:50:42.506 --> 01:50:45.047]  Those maggots need to step off the planet.
[01:50:45.047 --> 01:50:47.387]  Oh, but they've got to stay and cull us and manage it.
[01:50:47.387 --> 01:50:50.328]  Final segment with Mark Moreno, straight ahead, climatedepot.com.
[01:50:50.328 --> 01:50:51.709]  There's a war, folks.
[01:50:51.709 --> 01:50:53.529]  They're blowing our power systems now.
[01:50:53.529 --> 01:50:56.070]  Nobody else has a turnoff but Europe and the U.S.
[01:50:56.070 --> 01:50:57.030]  We're going down.
[01:50:57.030 --> 01:50:57.551]  Mayday!
[01:50:57.551 --> 01:50:58.031]  Mayday!
[01:50:58.031 --> 01:50:58.411]  Mayday!

[01:51:24.945 --> 01:51:26.406]  Brought to you by The Conservative Investor.
[01:51:26.406 --> 01:51:28.187]  Future returns, not indicative of future results.
[01:51:30.071 --> 01:51:32.633]  Think body armor is just for commandos?
[01:51:32.633 --> 01:51:33.593]  Think again.
[01:51:33.593 --> 01:51:37.196]  In a collapse situation, you need to protect your entire family.
[01:51:37.196 --> 01:51:43.199]  Infidel Body Armor has created lightweight armor that repels AR-15 and AK-47 rounds.
[01:51:43.199 --> 01:51:46.482]  And priced at around $500, it won't break the bank.
[01:51:46.482 --> 01:51:48.503]  The whole kit weighs just 10 pounds.
[01:51:48.503 --> 01:51:50.864]  Light enough for your 7-year-old or 70-year-old.
[01:51:50.864 --> 01:51:54.086]  Go to infidelbodyarmor.com and get yours today.
[01:51:54.086 --> 01:51:56.708]  That's infidelbodyarmor.com.
[01:51:56.708 --> 01:51:57.729]  Just won't quit.
[01:51:59.150 --> 01:52:04.875]  When fresh liquid whey is processed into a dry powder, the special proteins that make up the whey lose their original shapes.
[01:52:04.875 --> 01:52:07.758]  They fold in on themselves and lose their functional value.
[01:52:07.758 --> 01:52:14.544]  One World Whey undergoes a technological enhancement that we believe restores these potent proteins back to their original shapes the body can use.
[01:52:14.824 --> 01:52:21.449]  I chose to try One World Way first before going to a doctor who would likely only prescribe drugs.
[01:52:21.449 --> 01:52:23.731]  To my delight, it worked!
[01:52:23.731 --> 01:52:28.815]  After stabbing pain for years, to have it completely gone is a miracle.
[01:52:28.815 --> 01:52:35.380]  I'd like to also stress that, for me, it took several months of taking One World Way before I had improvement.
[01:52:35.640 --> 01:52:38.402]  And then an entire year for my gut to feel 100% healed.
[01:52:38.402 --> 01:52:47.570]  So now I tell my friends, give your body time to make use of the healing power of One World Way.
[01:52:47.570 --> 01:52:50.172]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit oneworldway.com.
[01:52:50.172 --> 01:52:52.154]  That's oneworld, W-H-E-Y dot com.
[01:52:58.593 --> 01:53:00.915]  Are you concerned about the Power Grid?
[01:53:00.915 --> 01:53:03.337]  About the new war on the Power Grid?
[01:53:03.337 --> 01:53:08.902]  If so, this will be the most important radio message you will ever hear, and the most valuable.
[01:53:08.902 --> 01:53:09.883]  Here's why.
[01:53:09.883 --> 01:53:15.448]  An important book revealing new and dangerous vulnerabilities of the Power Grid has just been written.
[01:53:15.448 --> 01:53:19.311]  Incredibly, the author has agreed to give away several free copies.
[01:53:19.591 --> 01:53:22.853]  But only for a limited time to GCN listeners.
[01:53:22.853 --> 01:53:27.557]  He simply asks that you pay $3 to cover part of the shipping and handling cost.
[01:53:27.557 --> 01:53:33.341]  Even better, if you're one of the first 17 online today, he will actually FedEx the book to you.
[01:53:33.341 --> 01:53:34.282]  Why do this?
[01:53:34.282 --> 01:53:38.165]  Why would he spend extra money and all that bother to FedEx his new book?
[01:53:38.165 --> 01:53:39.446]  The answer is simple.
[01:53:39.446 --> 01:53:43.609]  America's power grid is in grave danger and most Americans are clueless.
[01:53:43.609 --> 01:53:48.733]  Find out what's going on behind the scenes and why the most common question this author gets is,
[01:53:48.973 --> 01:53:50.455]  Do you fear for your life?
[01:53:50.455 --> 01:53:52.758]  Go to waronthegrid.com.
[01:53:52.758 --> 01:53:54.841]  That's waronthegrid.com.
[01:53:54.841 --> 01:53:55.482]  Don't wait.
[01:53:55.482 --> 01:53:57.204]  waronthegrid.com.
[01:54:14.489 --> 01:54:17.151]  Escape from the prison planet, Clutch bringing us in.
[01:54:17.151 --> 01:54:19.793]  Mark Moreno is our guest here on Earth Day.
[01:54:19.793 --> 01:54:29.339]  This is about the dictatorship of the proletariat, actually a bunch of mega banks and select energy companies, funding the takeover of all energy, all human activity.
[01:54:29.339 --> 01:54:32.561]  There's water, there's sunlight, there's carbon dioxide, there's oxygen.
[01:54:32.561 --> 01:54:37.425]  You gotta have those four things, and if you can tax one of them, you take over all human activity.
[01:54:37.425 --> 01:54:38.966]  This is an admitted sickening plan.
[01:54:40.735 --> 01:54:48.361]  And even Politico admits, you know, inside the war on coal, because there's so much more of that than oil, the oil companies in many cases are trying to shut coal down.
[01:54:48.361 --> 01:54:51.544]  I have zero coal holdings.
[01:54:51.544 --> 01:55:01.231]  Every time I say, let's not shut down all the coal, it's totally clean burning now, the way they have these scrubbers set up, I get emails, calls, how dare you, you know, you work for the coal companies.
[01:55:01.231 --> 01:55:04.614]  Quite frankly, my family's got a few oil wells and gas wells I don't really get any money from.
[01:55:04.614 --> 01:55:08.337]  In fact, I get no money from it, and it's not that much money for my family, but
[01:55:09.603 --> 01:55:13.324]  People go, well then you should really be for natural gas, it competes with coal.
[01:55:13.324 --> 01:55:21.367]  I want cheap, good, clean energy for America, and I sure don't want one-sided deals where hundreds of countries can have no controls, but we're being shut down.
[01:55:21.367 --> 01:55:23.848]  Folks, you understand, that's why we're shutting down.
[01:55:23.848 --> 01:55:25.909]  Mark Moreno, what else are you watching?
[01:55:25.909 --> 01:55:27.390]  What else is happening?
[01:55:27.390 --> 01:55:33.372]  I agree, we're winning the hearts and minds of the people, but they're just bureaucratically going ahead, robbing everything, stealing everything.
[01:55:34.736 --> 01:55:40.918]  I would say, in many important ways, climate skeptics have won every battle, but we may be losing the war as we speak.
[01:55:40.918 --> 01:55:49.022]  And the reason is Obama's cunning to go below the radar through executive order and no ratification for a UN treaty.
[01:55:49.022 --> 01:55:52.583]  Executive order with EPA, domestic, and now this treaty.
[01:55:52.583 --> 01:55:57.465]  Just make no mistake, when President Obama puts ink to paper today and commits us to this treaty,
[01:55:58.152 --> 01:56:05.025]  We are now, by the UN's own words, these treaties are quote, they redistribute wealth by climate policy.
[01:56:05.025 --> 01:56:06.848]  This is the absolute goal of them?
[01:56:07.575 --> 01:56:15.138]  And they're actually also openly talking about a CO2 budget for every man, woman, and child on the planet that will be monitored by international bureaucrats.
[01:56:15.138 --> 01:56:18.080]  If you use too much energy, fly too much, you're going to owe money.
[01:56:18.080 --> 01:56:20.261]  If you're under, you get some kind of credit.
[01:56:20.261 --> 01:56:31.566]  This is a new Orwellian world that we're facing, and this is a step, in Al Gore's own words, these treaties and climate bills and regulations are the first step to, quote, global governance, unquote.
[01:56:31.566 --> 01:56:32.086]  Their words.
[01:56:32.587 --> 01:56:39.947]  And by the way, Al Gore appears in Climate Hustle, and you go see it on May 2nd, he's talking about we need fertility management in Africa.
[01:56:40.849 --> 01:56:46.133]  We have to make fertility management ubiquitous, and then he goes on and complains about how many Africans there are projected to be.
[01:56:46.133 --> 01:56:47.834]  Yeah, that makes one child policy.
[01:56:47.834 --> 01:56:51.736]  As Lord Blonkton's done the numbers, a billion debt if they put in the Copenhagen plan.
[01:56:51.736 --> 01:56:54.178]  You were there, helped get the documents.
[01:56:54.178 --> 01:57:00.942]  This whole Copenhagen plan, once the third world saw it, and once even the socialists saw it, and learned it was a screw job, they said no.
[01:57:00.942 --> 01:57:02.523]  Isn't that their biggest problem?
[01:57:02.523 --> 01:57:06.126]  Just like Obamacare, that when they try to implement it, then people turn against it?
[01:57:06.126 --> 01:57:06.566]  Mark Moreno?
[01:57:07.793 --> 01:57:09.654]  Well yes, but here's how they're trying to solve it.
[01:57:09.654 --> 01:57:11.415]  They have what I call the Climate Flush Fund.
[01:57:11.415 --> 01:57:12.616]  It's $100 billion a year.
[01:57:12.616 --> 01:57:14.797]  It's going to be trillions of dollars in the end.
[01:57:14.797 --> 01:57:23.583]  And what they're doing is, if you're a corrupt third world dictator and you wouldn't have anything to do with this normally, suddenly you're looking at massive wealth transfers from other countries.
[01:57:23.583 --> 01:57:34.109]  I've talked to South African development activists who say this UN fund, they're buying off the developing world to sign on to these treaties by just cash to governments.
[01:57:34.109 --> 01:57:37.351]  And the governments are going to take this cash, enrich themselves,
[01:57:37.671 --> 01:57:38.011]  Sure, sure.
[01:57:38.011 --> 01:57:38.832]  Posted us for a while.
[01:58:01.227 --> 01:58:04.571]  Their leaders will be lined up at the trough getting this U.N.
[01:58:04.571 --> 01:58:04.831]  money.
[01:58:04.831 --> 01:58:09.295]  Well, take Obama two years ago saying you can't have cars and air conditioning to Africans.
[01:58:09.295 --> 01:58:12.339]  I mean, they're telling you, we're here to make you slaves, totally control you.
[01:58:12.339 --> 01:58:13.880]  Mark, if you've got to go, you've got to go.
[01:58:13.880 --> 01:58:16.083]  If you can do five more minutes, we're back in 70 seconds.
[01:58:16.083 --> 01:58:19.826]  I want to spend five minutes on the climate hustle, which they want you arrested for.
[01:58:19.826 --> 01:58:20.327]  If you can do it.
[01:58:20.327 --> 01:58:21.168]  If you can't, I understand.
[01:58:22.093 --> 01:58:22.973]  Yeah, sure, I can do it.
[01:58:22.973 --> 01:58:24.454]  No, I'll hang around.
[01:58:24.454 --> 01:58:24.894]  All right, good.
[01:58:24.894 --> 01:58:26.155]  Back in 70 seconds.
[01:58:26.155 --> 01:58:27.496]  Third hour straight ahead.
[01:58:27.496 --> 01:58:29.877]  Then Anthony Gucciardi hosts the fourth hour.
[01:58:29.877 --> 01:58:33.418]  And by the way, coming up in the next hour, I am going to blitz the news.
[01:58:33.418 --> 01:58:35.119]  There is so much, folks.
[01:58:35.119 --> 01:58:36.420]  So much happening.
[01:58:36.420 --> 01:58:38.521]  Politically correctness is a tyranny.
[01:58:38.521 --> 01:58:40.141]  They know it's a tyranny.
[01:58:40.141 --> 01:58:41.122]  They're not kooks.
[01:58:41.122 --> 01:58:42.423]  They're conquerors.
[01:58:42.423 --> 01:58:42.943]  We'll be back.
[01:58:42.943 --> 01:58:43.323]  Stay with us.
[01:58:48.681 --> 01:58:50.303]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[01:58:50.303 --> 01:58:51.804]  You can't survive without it.
[01:58:51.804 --> 01:58:53.006]  But where do you get it?
[01:58:53.006 --> 01:58:58.992]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[01:58:58.992 --> 01:59:04.718]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[01:59:04.898 --> 01:59:21.765]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[01:59:22.145 --> 01:59:24.646]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[01:59:24.646 --> 01:59:26.106]  Stainless steel construction.

[02:00:00.917 --> 02:00:03.699]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:00:03.699 --> 02:00:07.521]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.539 --> 02:00:23.385]  You know, I want to say we are the planetary defense force for America and for every free human out there.
[02:00:23.385 --> 02:00:30.434]  I mean, the globalists really are a bunch of con artists, anti-human eugenicists, that by the 1900s learned to basically pose as liberals.
[02:00:30.434 --> 02:00:31.976]  It's not been their traditional enemy.
[02:00:31.976 --> 02:00:35.260]  It was like real liberals that were for human empowerment, lower taxes.
[02:00:35.260 --> 02:00:36.722]  Paleo-conservatives is what they're called today.
[02:00:37.563 --> 02:00:39.044]  And I made the film Endgame to expose it.
[02:00:39.044 --> 02:00:40.065]  Mark Morano is our guest.
[02:00:40.065 --> 02:00:46.289]  He's made a film that I've seen a sneak peek clips of, not the whole thing, but some of the promotional material happening.
[02:00:46.289 --> 02:00:47.049]  I sent the link to it.
[02:00:47.049 --> 02:00:48.550]  It was a distributor.
[02:00:48.550 --> 02:00:50.071]  Mark Morano probably didn't even know that.
[02:00:50.071 --> 02:00:51.332]  And I watched about 30 minutes of it.
[02:00:51.332 --> 02:00:52.373]  Very powerful.
[02:00:52.373 --> 02:00:56.776]  Premiered over in Paris during their whole world government summit a few months ago.
[02:00:56.776 --> 02:00:57.716]  And just like I promote
[02:00:58.957 --> 02:01:02.079]  Behold a pale horse is being put out, and I promote this.
[02:01:02.079 --> 02:01:04.041]  I have no monetary connection to it.
[02:01:04.041 --> 02:01:09.164]  I'm just promoting it because we're all being attacked by this, and you need to go see the film.
[02:01:09.164 --> 02:01:12.026]  So Mark Moreno, how do the listeners go see the film?
[02:01:12.026 --> 02:01:13.027]  What's in the film?
[02:01:13.027 --> 02:01:14.508]  You know, we all know about this.
[02:01:14.508 --> 02:01:18.170]  Our audience knows, but their neighbors, their friends, their families don't.
[02:01:18.170 --> 02:01:21.332]  That's why everybody's got to become an info warrior.
[02:01:21.332 --> 02:01:26.235]  Everybody has to become a change agent to counter the communist and globalist change agents.
[02:01:26.235 --> 02:01:26.756]  Mark Moreno.
[02:01:28.291 --> 02:01:29.031]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:01:29.031 --> 02:01:33.254]  Yeah, you go to climatehustle.com and you can look up the local theater.
[02:01:33.254 --> 02:01:37.796]  We're going to be in about 400 theaters and growing on May 2nd, one night only.
[02:01:37.796 --> 02:01:39.657]  You can buy your tickets online.
[02:01:39.657 --> 02:01:42.199]  It includes a panel discussion after the film.
[02:01:42.199 --> 02:01:44.360]  Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[02:01:44.360 --> 02:01:46.361]  I'm going to give you the last three minutes.
[02:01:46.361 --> 02:01:48.582]  You are having an opening on 400 screens.
[02:01:48.582 --> 02:01:50.624]  That is bigger than most films.
[02:01:50.624 --> 02:01:53.005]  You have engaged in a massive coup, my friend.
[02:01:54.099 --> 02:01:54.979]  Thank you very much.
[02:01:54.979 --> 02:01:58.681]  Yeah, this is, it's a nationwide theatrical release.
[02:01:58.681 --> 02:02:00.762]  We have the left irate with us.
[02:02:00.762 --> 02:02:01.743]  They are so mad.
[02:02:01.743 --> 02:02:07.585]  They're trying to, they're going after the film distributor company, asking all sorts of, they're angry that this is happening.
[02:02:07.585 --> 02:02:08.506]  And the key to this
[02:02:09.091 --> 02:02:16.257]  Alex, we're showing that the climate claims in science have become so untenable that politically left scientists are descending.
[02:02:16.257 --> 02:02:28.347]  We feature French socialist geophysicist, Dr. Claude Allegré, who actually was worried about global warming 20 years ago and he's now reversed himself and is a major skeptic in France, one of the leading scientists.
[02:02:28.787 --> 02:02:38.614]  We feature Nobel Prize winning scientists who endorsed President Obama for President in 2008 and is now one of the leading voices of climate skepticism for the Nobel Prize for Physics.
[02:02:38.614 --> 02:02:44.478]  We feature scientists from Ivy League universities who voted for Al Gore, think he's a smart man, would vote for Al Gore again,
[02:02:44.878 --> 02:02:47.580]  But were appalled when they went and watched the movie.
[02:02:47.580 --> 02:02:51.882]  So this movie features liberals bashing climate science.
[02:02:51.882 --> 02:02:56.665]  It's not, oh, this is a bunch of libertarian conservative, you know, scientists and activists.
[02:02:56.665 --> 02:02:58.206]  These are the scientists themselves.
[02:02:58.206 --> 02:02:59.287]  I mean, it's a fact.
[02:02:59.287 --> 02:03:00.228]  We have their emails.
[02:03:00.228 --> 02:03:02.009]  It's all a lie, a power grab.
[02:03:03.450 --> 02:03:05.011]  Yes, and we get into that too.
[02:03:05.011 --> 02:03:05.971]  That's one of the key things.
[02:03:05.971 --> 02:03:11.914]  Many of the scientists reversed their view of climate after the Climategate scandal of 2009-2010.
[02:03:11.914 --> 02:03:13.835]  And we get into the absurdity of it.
[02:03:13.835 --> 02:03:17.256]  We talk about the climate tipping points, how they're decades, years, months.
[02:03:17.256 --> 02:03:18.757]  We get down to minutes, seconds.
[02:03:18.757 --> 02:03:23.039]  I mean, they imply that polar bears are dying and can't swim and the numbers are up five-fold.
[02:03:24.472 --> 02:03:35.610]  Yes, the numbers were probably 5,000 to 10,000 in the 1960s, were actually in excess as of last year for the first time ever, in excess of estimates now of over 30,000 global polar bears.
[02:03:35.610 --> 02:03:38.013]  Numbers that have just rebounded spectacularly.
[02:03:39.696 --> 02:03:41.476]  We get into witchcraft.
[02:03:41.476 --> 02:03:55.240]  We show how in the Middle Ages people accused witches of changing the weather, crop failure, extreme storms, and now they're literally accusing our SUVs and our energy plants and our HDTVs of causing bad weather.
[02:03:55.240 --> 02:03:58.760]  Actually, the word they're using is fossil fuel poison weather.
[02:03:58.760 --> 02:04:02.501]  We get into how they claim global warming causes prostitution, airline turbulence.
[02:04:02.501 --> 02:04:05.582]  Look, there's a total mumbo-jumbo attempted cult takeover.
[02:04:06.963 --> 02:04:15.968]  Yes, it actually featured the scientist, you'll get to see him in his own words, a man calling for shrinking humans, genetically altering humans to fight global warming to reduce our carbon footprint.
[02:04:15.968 --> 02:04:19.410]  That's directly out of Brave New World!
[02:04:19.410 --> 02:04:22.532]  Yes, you may have read about this guy, but you've never seen the video before.
[02:04:22.532 --> 02:04:27.375]  We featured him in the movie openly talking about shrinking human beings to fight global warming.
[02:04:28.755 --> 02:04:30.036]  I saw that in the Guardian.
[02:04:30.036 --> 02:04:31.076]  I didn't know you interviewed him.
[02:04:31.076 --> 02:04:32.417]  Mark Moreno, congratulations.
[02:04:32.417 --> 02:04:34.418]  Come back right before the film comes out.
[02:04:34.418 --> 02:04:35.318]  I can't wait to see it.
[02:04:35.318 --> 02:04:37.599]  Wow, 400 screens, that means it'll be in Austin.
[02:04:37.599 --> 02:04:42.942]  Our listeners everywhere, go to ClimateHustle.org, buy your tickets now, and that'll make it big.
[02:04:42.942 --> 02:04:46.724]  I mean, folks, opening on 400 screens is bigger than most blockbusters.
[02:04:46.724 --> 02:04:48.445]  Mark, you've done an incredible job.
[02:04:48.445 --> 02:04:51.967]  I'm so thankful that you're out there, and I sleep better at night.
[02:04:51.967 --> 02:04:52.387]  Thank you, sir.
[02:04:53.154 --> 02:04:53.815]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:04:53.815 --> 02:04:54.556]  Appreciate it.
[02:04:54.556 --> 02:04:54.996]  Okay.
[02:04:54.996 --> 02:04:55.497]  Wow.
[02:04:55.497 --> 02:04:55.797]  Okay.
[02:04:55.797 --> 02:04:56.838]  We'll be back with the news.
[02:04:56.838 --> 02:04:57.259]  Stay with us.
[02:04:57.259 --> 02:04:58.701]  This is stunning.
[02:04:58.701 --> 02:05:06.410]  Hey, Joe Biggs here with some brand new information about the social justice warrior fight for freedom and allowing men to go into women's restrooms.
[02:05:06.410 --> 02:05:09.694]  Target stores open women's bathrooms and changing rooms to men.
[02:05:09.694 --> 02:05:10.855]  Yay!
[02:05:10.855 --> 02:05:12.357]  Now our women and daughters are safe.
[02:05:12.597 --> 02:05:14.238]  It's so accepting and progressive!
[02:05:14.238 --> 02:05:14.918]  It's cool!
[02:05:14.918 --> 02:05:23.102]  The Target apartment store chain has jumped into the transgender bathroom debate by declaring that men who claim to be women may use whatever bathroom or changing room they choose!
[02:05:23.102 --> 02:05:23.782]  Yay!
[02:05:23.782 --> 02:05:25.943]  We're making such progressive waves!
[02:05:25.943 --> 02:05:29.305]  Inclusivity is a core belief at Target, a new company's statement reads.
[02:05:29.305 --> 02:05:30.626]  It's something we celebrate!
[02:05:30.626 --> 02:05:39.430]  We stand for equality and strive to make our guests and team members feel accepted, respected, and welcomed in our stores and workplaces every day.
[02:05:39.730 --> 02:05:42.272]  We're not even worried about the actual transgendered people.
[02:05:42.272 --> 02:05:43.253]  It's the pedophiles.
[02:05:43.253 --> 02:05:47.297]  It's the ones who are going to go in there, put on a dress, and go after young girls.
[02:05:47.297 --> 02:05:48.938]  That is what we're worried about.
[02:05:48.938 --> 02:05:50.039]  This has got to end.
[02:05:50.039 --> 02:05:54.603]  This social justice warrior bulls*** is f***ing ridiculous.
[02:05:54.603 --> 02:05:56.885]  I'm Joe Biggs and I do not approve this message.
[02:05:58.539 --> 02:06:03.602]  Over the years, there have been a lot of powerful advancements in the field of science and nutraceuticals.
[02:06:03.602 --> 02:06:12.446]  Youngevity integrates years of scientific research into creating fantastic products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, plant-derived minerals, and much more.

[02:08:11.660 --> 02:08:13.020]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:13.020 --> 02:08:16.343]  It's the time of the season.
[02:08:18.905 --> 02:08:28.932]  What's the time of the season for love right now, let me tell you?
[02:08:47.739 --> 02:08:51.922]  Love of this species surviving.
[02:08:51.922 --> 02:08:58.065]  Folks, you start caring about the species, you start really dialing in to what's going on and get involved.
[02:08:58.065 --> 02:09:03.129]  It is exhilarating.
[02:09:03.129 --> 02:09:07.912]  The globalists sell this idea of don't care about anybody in your life, not even yourself.
[02:09:07.912 --> 02:09:14.816]  And somehow, by not caring and getting rid of your emotions, you are
[02:09:16.610 --> 02:09:20.452]  Some type of super person.
[02:09:20.452 --> 02:09:29.475]  The truth is you're not even conscious, in my view, when you get to that point.
[02:09:29.475 --> 02:09:30.195]  All right.
[02:09:30.195 --> 02:09:34.157]  In fact, because I'm mentioning that, let me get to this first.
[02:09:34.157 --> 02:09:38.779]  Then I'm just going to plow through all the other news that's here and open the phones up.
[02:09:41.223 --> 02:09:56.012]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231, on any issue, any subject, any news piece you wish to discuss.
[02:09:56.012 --> 02:10:03.577]  But I want to get to, speaking of people not caring about each other, video, man attack, left for dead, bystanders do nothing, CBS Chicago.
[02:10:03.577 --> 02:10:05.197]  I'm going to get to that in a moment.
[02:10:05.197 --> 02:10:09.020]  But first, GOP Chair Priebus, Rince Priebus,
[02:10:10.273 --> 02:10:18.520]  If Trump wins 1, 2, 3, 6 delegates, that magic number, 1,236 delegates, it's not enough!
[02:10:18.520 --> 02:10:22.504]  They always said he'll never get there and then we'll take it away, but now it's clear he's going to get there.
[02:10:22.504 --> 02:10:24.986]  He's saying it's not enough.
[02:10:24.986 --> 02:10:26.007]  So let's go ahead and go to that clip.
[02:10:26.007 --> 02:10:26.267]  Here it is.
[02:10:26.980 --> 02:10:36.268]  If Donald Trump gets 1,236, one shy, you're going to have all those people out there saying, well, he has most of the votes.
[02:10:36.268 --> 02:10:38.410]  He doesn't have the magic number.
[02:10:38.410 --> 02:10:41.772]  Now what do you say to those people when they say, well, he's 1,236.
[02:10:41.772 --> 02:10:43.614]  That's more than anybody else.
[02:10:43.614 --> 02:10:44.475]  It's just one shy.
[02:10:46.747 --> 02:10:53.913]  I would say that if you get a plurality of the vote, that means the majority went to somebody else, or somebody's else.
[02:10:53.913 --> 02:10:54.374]  What?
[02:10:54.374 --> 02:10:56.656]  It's no different than when I ran for chairman.
[02:10:56.656 --> 02:11:02.621]  I won on the seventh ballot, Greta, and I was ahead on every ballot.
[02:11:02.621 --> 02:11:08.005]  But on the sixth ballot, even though I was always ahead of everyone, that meant the field had more votes than I did.
[02:11:08.826 --> 02:11:13.691]  And that meant that I actually had a minority of the votes because everyone else had a majority.
[02:11:13.691 --> 02:11:15.272]  So you have to get a majority.
[02:11:15.272 --> 02:11:22.959]  And if people don't understand that a majority in our party is what it takes to be the nominee, then
[02:11:23.920 --> 02:11:26.362]  I don't know how else to explain it any differently.
[02:11:26.362 --> 02:11:35.527]  You actually have to have the majority of the support of delegates on the floor of our party in order to be our nominee.
[02:11:35.527 --> 02:11:37.248]  I don't think that's very complicated.
[02:11:37.248 --> 02:11:42.390]  I'm sure you're getting emails, but I think the vast majority of people understand that.
[02:11:42.390 --> 02:11:46.853]  You could teach a college course on BS off what he just said in a minute and a half.
[02:11:46.853 --> 02:11:50.295]  That is the biggest load of horse manure I have ever seen or witnessed.
[02:11:51.957 --> 02:12:03.586]  You've got that candy ass, excuse my French, it's true though, sitting up there, A, saying that 1237 isn't a majority.
[02:12:03.586 --> 02:12:06.208]  That is a majority of the delegates.
[02:12:06.208 --> 02:12:13.174]  So now he's playing games with arithmetic, 2 plus 2 equals 5, like Obama says.
[02:12:13.174 --> 02:12:16.657]  And you've got Rince Prevost saying the party decides.
[02:12:20.464 --> 02:12:25.266]  They're appointing the superdelegates that are ignoring delegates that voted for Trump.
[02:12:25.266 --> 02:12:28.948]  They've already stolen, conservatively, a hundred delegates.
[02:12:28.948 --> 02:12:32.129]  A hundred points from him.
[02:12:32.129 --> 02:12:39.093]  I mean, they've stolen them in Louisiana, in Tennessee, in Arizona, in Colorado, just everywhere.
[02:12:39.093 --> 02:12:41.194]  Georgia.
[02:12:41.194 --> 02:12:43.175]  Last number, I think I counted it up, that's like 115 or something.
[02:12:47.745 --> 02:12:52.350]  So they're stealing it at every level, and then they sit there and say, oh, but he's got to have a majority.
[02:12:52.350 --> 02:12:55.973]  Well, 1237 is a majority.
[02:12:55.973 --> 02:12:57.695]  He lies and says that's not a majority.
[02:12:57.695 --> 02:12:59.036]  It's more than 50%.
[02:13:01.445 --> 02:13:06.728]  And then he says, oh I'm sure you're getting emails, I'm sure you are, but listen, the majority of people don't.
[02:13:06.728 --> 02:13:08.168]  He's using mind control.
[02:13:08.168 --> 02:13:09.909]  Oh, most people aren't upset.
[02:13:09.909 --> 02:13:18.393]  He wants 80% of the viewers watching Fox News that are mad about this, even if they don't support Trump, they're upset about the vote not counting, to feel like they're alone.
[02:13:18.393 --> 02:13:23.796]  It's all about, you're alone, you have no power, the majority are speaking, the majority aren't.
[02:13:23.796 --> 02:13:25.917]  It's like Ted Cruz getting up and saying,
[02:13:27.452 --> 02:13:29.613]  We're having landslides.
[02:13:29.613 --> 02:13:30.994]  It's fake Texas action.
[02:13:30.994 --> 02:13:32.735]  We're having grassroots rebellions.
[02:13:32.735 --> 02:13:40.180]  The voters have spoken and Donald Trump... Can't do a very good imitation of him.
[02:13:40.180 --> 02:13:48.505]  And Donald Trump is a sore loser.
[02:13:48.505 --> 02:13:49.526]  So, again...
[02:13:51.215 --> 02:13:53.677]  What do you say to something like that?
[02:13:53.677 --> 02:13:57.019]  When everything Rince Priebus is saying is a deception.
[02:13:57.019 --> 02:13:59.340]  They've been stealing the votes from Bernie Sanders.
[02:13:59.340 --> 02:14:01.882]  I don't like Bernie Sanders.
[02:14:01.882 --> 02:14:06.365]  I know he represents populism, he has some good people to support him in some cases, who are just sick of the establishment.
[02:14:06.365 --> 02:14:08.046]  They'd go for anything that wasn't establishment.
[02:14:08.046 --> 02:14:09.707]  I'm kind of like that with Trump.
[02:14:09.707 --> 02:14:11.608]  But I just couldn't hold my nose to the point of Sanders.
[02:14:11.608 --> 02:14:14.910]  I don't know, I'd probably vote for him over Hillary, I'll be honest.
[02:14:14.910 --> 02:14:16.111]  Okay, fine.
[02:14:16.111 --> 02:14:16.611]  I've said it.
[02:14:16.611 --> 02:14:18.152]  I mean, yeah, okay, I like him better than her.
[02:14:18.152 --> 02:14:19.213]  So I get why people are going for
[02:14:20.307 --> 02:14:21.107]  Bernie Sanders, okay?
[02:14:21.107 --> 02:14:21.948]  I'll admit it.
[02:14:21.948 --> 02:14:23.408]  I get it.
[02:14:23.408 --> 02:14:24.889]  I got some serious issues with Trump.
[02:14:24.889 --> 02:14:27.750]  Nothing like Sanders, but, you know, I can hold my nose here.
[02:14:27.750 --> 02:14:29.691]  Because they're freaking out over him, folks.
[02:14:29.691 --> 02:14:30.792]  He's a populist.
[02:14:30.792 --> 02:14:32.672]  He doesn't want to turn our power plants off.
[02:14:32.672 --> 02:14:35.634]  He doesn't want China to have giant tariffs on us when we have none.
[02:14:35.634 --> 02:14:42.136]  We're being screwed over by a political elite that think they own the country because they hijacked it.
[02:14:42.136 --> 02:14:48.179]  They really think they own it with a straight face to tell you it's democracy when you don't get to vote or your vote's ignored.
[02:14:52.679 --> 02:15:00.441]  And so now Rince Prevost is trying to sell people on even if Trump gets the 1237, ignoring it.
[02:15:00.441 --> 02:15:02.882]  I tell you, I'm going to be in Cleveland that whole week.
[02:15:02.882 --> 02:15:04.943]  Our crew's going to be there broadcasting live.
[02:15:04.943 --> 02:15:06.623]  This is going to be a three-ring circus.
[02:15:06.623 --> 02:15:11.205]  And I don't get pleasure off an event like this, all the viewers we're going to have and the listeners.
[02:15:11.205 --> 02:15:13.525]  I would love to defeat the globalists.
[02:15:13.525 --> 02:15:15.186]  He'll have some issues beyond the year, you know.
[02:15:15.885 --> 02:15:17.386]  We're not calling for a utopia here.
[02:15:17.386 --> 02:15:18.127]  There's no such thing.
[02:15:18.127 --> 02:15:19.528]  We don't claim we're delivering one.
[02:15:19.528 --> 02:15:21.931]  I'll just retire once the utopia is delivered.
[02:15:21.931 --> 02:15:27.076]  But, you know, if we weren't in a death battle, I wouldn't be working 15, 16 hours a day.
[02:15:27.076 --> 02:15:29.818]  To the point of, sometimes I get dizzy and I'm so tired.
[02:15:29.818 --> 02:15:34.122]  And I'm trying to make a decision, you know, like it's 7 at night and I'm like, been working since 7 a.m.
[02:15:34.122 --> 02:15:36.645]  and I'm like, hold on, let me just lean on the table here.
[02:15:38.024 --> 02:15:42.146]  Literally, folks, you start really trying to get into your instincts, your mind, to make a decision.
[02:15:42.146 --> 02:15:43.087]  You're really trying to focus.
[02:15:43.087 --> 02:15:45.308]  You've been working 15, 16 hours a day.
[02:15:45.308 --> 02:15:52.432]  I've got to sit down sometimes and lay down and close my eyes for five minutes to be able to make a decision.
[02:15:52.432 --> 02:15:55.514]  And all I want is people to go, well, don't worry.
[02:15:55.514 --> 02:16:00.717]  Analysts say that radio and conservatives are going to make a lot more money if Hillary gets in.
[02:16:00.717 --> 02:16:06.080]  I'd rather go bankrupt and be homeless on the side of the road than have Hillary Clinton be president.
[02:16:08.174 --> 02:16:13.637]  Again, it's like people that go, well, your family's got some gas wells, and that's in direct competition with coal.
[02:16:13.637 --> 02:16:14.858]  Don't you want to bankrupt coal?
[02:16:14.858 --> 02:16:15.739]  You might make more money.
[02:16:15.739 --> 02:16:20.141]  I just go, what planet are you from, man?
[02:16:20.141 --> 02:16:22.883]  It's a free market.
[02:16:22.883 --> 02:16:26.145]  I'm going to destroy the whole country so I get a little bit more money?
[02:16:26.145 --> 02:16:27.846]  You're called an idiot.
[02:16:27.846 --> 02:16:29.747]  You're an idiot!
[02:16:29.747 --> 02:16:31.328]  You people think you're so smart.
[02:16:31.328 --> 02:16:35.811]  You think being backstabbing, knuckle-dragging punks is cool.
[02:16:35.811 --> 02:16:36.952]  It's not cool!
[02:16:39.056 --> 02:16:41.137]  And you're all gonna cry for your mommy during the depression.
[02:16:41.137 --> 02:16:46.018]  And you're all gonna be hanging around a bunch of people that stab you in the back and don't stand up for each other.
[02:16:46.018 --> 02:16:52.421]  God, your great reward is your biggest curse, isn't it?
[02:16:52.421 --> 02:17:01.564]  You know, to me, and I'm not even close to that perfect of a person, but I just get basic honor.
[02:17:01.564 --> 02:17:05.025]  And it's because genetically,
[02:17:07.233 --> 02:17:11.017]  People that weren't honorable were destroyed and killed.
[02:17:11.017 --> 02:17:21.406]  So, in natural selection, my ancestors weren't screwing people over in some of the most warlike regions in human history.
[02:17:21.406 --> 02:17:26.571]  And then I just look at all these idiots sitting here in the West and what everything we've built and done
[02:17:27.666 --> 02:17:37.750]  Urinating all over it and dancing around like clowns thinking you're developing something better because the globalists have released you like a cancer to bring down civilization.
[02:17:37.750 --> 02:17:55.718]  And you're dancing around with a dull light in your eyes like you are the new conquerors and you are the new lords of the earth when all you are is morons that collaborated in your own destruction?
[02:17:59.744 --> 02:18:01.605]  I've said this a thousand times, I'll say it again.
[02:18:01.605 --> 02:18:17.849]  I would have to have the most blind, moronic, bull-like courage to not fight this with everything I've got.
[02:18:17.849 --> 02:18:20.630]  And to just hope everything turned out or go along with it.
[02:18:20.630 --> 02:18:23.471]  Because you intellectually analyze the New World Order, it's about betrayal.
[02:18:23.471 --> 02:18:24.611]  It's about the end of humanity.
[02:18:24.611 --> 02:18:28.412]  It's about everything bad and treachery and just evil.
[02:18:30.526 --> 02:18:34.270]  That's why it's an oxymoron when callers call in and say, thank you for your courage.
[02:18:34.270 --> 02:18:35.090]  Oh, you're so great.
[02:18:35.090 --> 02:18:35.991]  Oh, we love you.
[02:18:35.991 --> 02:18:36.752]  Thank you.
[02:18:36.752 --> 02:18:37.873]  Courage?
[02:18:37.873 --> 02:18:49.684]  This is done out of absolute panic and just death battle energy fighting for my life and my children's life.
[02:18:49.684 --> 02:18:53.728]  The New World Order is coming to take over the species and basically end us.
[02:18:53.728 --> 02:18:55.710]  You think it's heroic to fight that?
[02:19:01.471 --> 02:19:04.512]  You think it's heroic?
[02:19:04.512 --> 02:19:11.935]  If you see your neighbor's house on fire and you know they're there and their cars are parked but nobody's coming out, to go kick down the door and try to see if he can get in and save somebody?
[02:19:11.935 --> 02:19:13.555]  That's self-preservation.
[02:19:13.555 --> 02:19:16.717]  I want a neighbor next to me so he'll take care of me.
[02:19:16.717 --> 02:19:17.797]  See, they took that away from us.
[02:19:17.797 --> 02:19:18.697]  People don't have that anymore.
[02:19:18.697 --> 02:19:19.398]  They don't know that.
[02:19:19.398 --> 02:19:25.980]  When we come back, I'm going to play this clip and then go to your phone calls from out of Chicago where somebody's beat up, mugged, the liquor store owner, robbed.
[02:19:27.168 --> 02:19:29.349]  Left in the road, a taxi cab doesn't even care.
[02:19:29.349 --> 02:19:31.470]  There's a body in the road, I'm gonna run it over.
[02:19:31.470 --> 02:19:33.791]  Runs him over and still nobody helps him.
[02:19:33.791 --> 02:19:44.236]  And this is happening more and more where people think they're getting ahead, not caring about somebody else that's dead or dying and bleebed in the corner.
[02:19:44.236 --> 02:19:47.938]  That person in the ditch is you.
[02:19:47.938 --> 02:19:49.779]  And the fact that you didn't pull over to save them.
[02:19:51.002 --> 02:19:52.646]  Shows you don't want to save yourself.
[02:19:52.646 --> 02:19:56.835]  The only time I wouldn't pull over if somebody was dying in a ditch is when one of my kids was dying.
[02:19:58.949 --> 02:20:05.973]  It's no secret that pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, moles, and fungus can inflict severe damage in the human body.
[02:20:05.973 --> 02:20:10.596]  Fortunately, a new and vastly improved silver solution has been developed.
[02:20:10.596 --> 02:20:21.103]  Supernatural Silver is a revolutionary, broad-spectrum, antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal solution that can be used inside the body as well as on the skin.
[02:20:21.383 --> 02:20:34.978]  Supernatural silver is unique and superior to colloidal and ionic silvers using a patented technology that is highly effective against colds, flus, infections, food poisoning, and yeast, in addition to many other pathogens.
[02:20:36.520 --> 02:20:37.080]  We're good to go.
[02:20:58.407 --> 02:21:00.448]  Hello, I'm Michael Reagan.
[02:21:00.448 --> 02:21:13.373]  My father, President Ronald Reagan, believed so strongly in gold that he changed gold ownership forever by bringing back physical gold to the American public, allowing gold coins to be minted and sold to U.S.
[02:21:13.373 --> 02:21:15.814]  citizens just like you, starting in 1985.
[02:21:17.074 --> 02:21:23.997]  Gold ownership can help protect your financial future, especially when our national debt is spiraling out of control.
[02:21:23.997 --> 02:21:32.020]  Many smart Americans have kept their retirements from being wiped out during America's financial crisis thanks to physical gold coins.
[02:21:32.020 --> 02:21:34.661]  I strongly urge you to call the U.S.
[02:21:34.661 --> 02:21:37.542]  Money Reserve at 1-866-944-GOLD or go online to usmoneyreserve.com
[02:21:41.323 --> 02:21:47.106]  As for a special gold guide with new, never-before-released information about gold from the U.S.
[02:21:47.106 --> 02:21:55.551]  Money Reserve, call 1-866-944-GOLD or go online to usmoneyreserve.com.
[02:21:55.551 --> 02:21:56.752]  I'm Michael Reagan.
[02:21:56.752 --> 02:21:57.092]  Thank you.
[02:21:58.274 --> 02:22:02.455]  When I was 15 and a half years of age, I had two large mercury fillings put into my teeth.
[02:22:02.455 --> 02:22:06.656]  I got very sick that day, and over time, the mercury exposure damaged my body.
[02:22:06.656 --> 02:22:09.557]  My sunny disposition turned to depression and low energy.
[02:22:09.557 --> 02:22:15.779]  Many years later, I understood what had happened, and in 1991, I replaced these mercury fillings with white composite.
[02:22:15.779 --> 02:22:21.120]  In 1997, I learned that the homeopathic mercury detox I did years earlier did not remove the mercury from my body.
[02:22:21.540 --> 02:22:24.342]  I began an effective means of removing mercury from my body.
[02:22:24.342 --> 02:22:28.264]  My digestion and elimination returned to normal and I began to have my life back.
[02:22:28.264 --> 02:22:35.247]  From 1999 to 2005, I tested the level of mercury in my body and each test showed my mercury burden was high.
[02:22:35.247 --> 02:22:38.849]  After five years on One World Way, I recently did another mercury test.
[02:22:38.849 --> 02:22:42.951]  The results showed my body is free of mercury and virtually all toxic metals.
[02:22:42.951 --> 02:22:45.893]  One World Way is very powerful for detoxification support.
[02:22:45.893 --> 02:22:47.974]  It has helped many and it may help you.
[02:22:47.974 --> 02:22:48.294]  Call 888-

[02:23:53.207 --> 02:23:54.668]  Brought to you by The Conservative Investor.
[02:23:54.668 --> 02:23:56.450]  Future returns, not indicative of future results.
[02:24:32.014 --> 02:24:33.856]  Alright, your calls are coming up in the next segment.
[02:24:33.856 --> 02:24:34.998]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:24:34.998 --> 02:24:36.520]  Infowars.com is the website.
[02:24:36.520 --> 02:24:39.784]  If you're a radio listener, I'll just describe this video.
[02:24:39.784 --> 02:24:41.486]  We can play it for folks.
[02:24:41.486 --> 02:24:45.411]  Also, if you're watching this live streaming, you can go to video on CBS News Chicago.
[02:24:45.411 --> 02:24:46.652]  Man attacked, left for dead.
[02:24:46.652 --> 02:24:47.753]  Bystanders do nothing.
[02:24:48.877 --> 02:24:51.298]  In fact, we probably shouldn't even show the video because it's so sad.
[02:24:51.298 --> 02:24:52.578]  Let's just not show it, okay?
[02:24:52.578 --> 02:24:53.359]  Thank you.
[02:24:53.359 --> 02:24:59.801]  Nobody helped a popular bartender when he was attacked at a Northside convenience store.
[02:24:59.801 --> 02:25:05.243]  That's because everyone's been brought up in front of TVs and doesn't even know how to talk now.
[02:25:05.243 --> 02:25:08.584]  And the IQs have dropped 15 points the last 20 years.
[02:25:08.584 --> 02:25:11.986]  Soon, speech will be a conspiracy theory.
[02:25:11.986 --> 02:25:13.066]  Seriously, let's say it never existed.
[02:25:15.953 --> 02:25:30.584]  Nobody helped a popular bartender when he was attacked at a Northside convenience store, knocked unconscious, robbed, run over by a cab, and left for dead in the street.
[02:25:30.584 --> 02:25:39.010]  The video shows the man, Marquez Gaines, wearing a blue shirt, being confronted by another man, who appears to be agitated.
[02:25:39.010 --> 02:25:42.813]  The man then punches Gaines in the head, knocking him to the street, unconscious.
[02:25:43.666 --> 02:25:49.730]  At least one person runs up and appears to steal his wallet as a crowd immediately surrounds Gaines.
[02:25:49.730 --> 02:25:55.635]  But see, then society collapses when all people do is run around and grab wallets like the government does or Al Gore does.
[02:25:55.635 --> 02:25:56.896]  See, people just stop producing.
[02:25:56.896 --> 02:26:00.258]  That's how you defend yourself.
[02:26:00.258 --> 02:26:04.641]  Then pretty soon the elite are in a castle with food stores running down and everything burning outside.
[02:26:04.641 --> 02:26:06.203]  And that's what they like, though.
[02:26:06.203 --> 02:26:06.663]  They enjoy it.
[02:26:08.680 --> 02:26:12.525]  They then walk away, leaving Gaines in the street motionless for about two minutes.
[02:26:12.525 --> 02:26:19.855]  As police arrive, one cab driver appears to try to get out of the way of squad cars and runs over Gaines, killing him!
[02:26:19.855 --> 02:26:26.103]  In all the hysteria, Gaines' family has filed a lawsuit against 7-Eleven, contending the store should be held liable.
[02:26:27.458 --> 02:26:31.142]  Who are we as a people?
[02:26:31.142 --> 02:26:32.303]  Don't we love each other anymore?
[02:26:32.303 --> 02:26:35.826]  Yes, the answer is for the moral unraveling of society
[02:26:46.036 --> 02:26:54.741]  Is put security guards everywhere, like TSA, leave the border open, bring in radical Muslims, let them get on planes and blow stuff up, and then take everyone's rights away when they attack.
[02:26:54.741 --> 02:27:05.247]  Or, Chicago had the highest murder rate in the world until a year ago, and then it doubled in one year to double the highest crime rate in the world.
[02:27:05.247 --> 02:27:06.868]  Total gun ban!
[02:27:06.868 --> 02:27:14.473]  Big Chicago mafia bringing the drugs in, people not caring about each other, bedlam, murder, no one helping each other, the collapse of society.
[02:27:16.676 --> 02:27:24.488]  And the answer, of course, is cut rap videos about killing Donald Trump that come out of Chicago.
[02:27:24.488 --> 02:27:27.112]  Don't care that Obama doubled black unemployment.
[02:27:27.112 --> 02:27:31.739]  Don't let the facts get in the way of your delusions.
[02:27:33.814 --> 02:27:34.615]  But this is nothing.
[02:27:34.615 --> 02:27:35.676]  This story is nothing.
[02:27:35.676 --> 02:27:38.658]  I see reports all the time.
[02:27:38.658 --> 02:27:39.679]  Constantly.
[02:27:39.679 --> 02:27:41.020]  You see them too.
[02:27:41.020 --> 02:27:58.255]  Where it'll be like Toronto, or it'll be New York City, LA, and a woman will get beat up in broad daylight, raped in a parking lot, and business executives will, in one case, watch her get raped and tell their employees, don't call the police, I don't want you on the clock having to fill out a report.
[02:27:59.301 --> 02:28:02.466]  That CEO, remember that phone company a few years ago?
[02:28:02.466 --> 02:28:03.568]  Got in trouble for it.
[02:28:03.568 --> 02:28:05.932]  He thought that would cut their productivity.
[02:28:09.591 --> 02:28:18.195]  Instead of even as a sociopath realizing PR-wise, if he would have run out and saved her, the CEO of the phone digital company would have been a hero.
[02:28:18.195 --> 02:28:19.555]  But see, they don't think like that.
[02:28:19.555 --> 02:28:23.577]  They can't even do something good if it helps them, even because they're evil.
[02:28:23.577 --> 02:28:27.419]  Because they don't want to do good because they're evil, they don't ever think about the good.
[02:28:27.419 --> 02:28:33.161]  See, a good person just does good because they want to do good, and then it comes back on them that way, and then they don't even think about it because they're good.
[02:28:33.161 --> 02:28:34.722]  That's just the way it works.
[02:28:34.722 --> 02:28:35.542]  But an evil person...
[02:28:37.329 --> 02:28:41.210]  They see a woman beaten with a pipe, raped by three men.
[02:28:41.210 --> 02:28:42.710]  This went on for like 45 minutes.
[02:28:42.710 --> 02:28:46.571]  It was in the Toronto Star years ago.
[02:28:46.571 --> 02:28:54.513]  And they're sitting there on a major street with their parking lot, watching her finally bleed to death with head wounds.
[02:28:54.513 --> 02:29:00.694]  And the head guy said, don't call the police, I don't want us having to get in the middle of this, and laughed at her crawling around on the ground after they were done with her.
[02:29:01.550 --> 02:29:03.411]  And that's just one microcosm example.
[02:29:03.411 --> 02:29:08.115]  In China, millions and millions of people a year just die on the side of the road.
[02:29:08.115 --> 02:29:10.597]  There's children crawling around their own excrement.
[02:29:10.597 --> 02:29:12.378]  Humans are being murdered for their political views.
[02:29:12.378 --> 02:29:14.260]  Organs being sold.
[02:29:14.260 --> 02:29:15.781]  And this is who we're supposed to compete with?
[02:29:15.781 --> 02:29:22.746]  They have no environmental standards, no insurance, no regulations, no controls, no nothing, no carbon taxes.
[02:29:22.746 --> 02:29:25.889]  Our government has made deals so they can have huge tariffs on us on top of it.
[02:29:27.449 --> 02:29:30.771]  Oh, they're Chinese, so it's okay their government does that.
[02:29:30.771 --> 02:29:34.574]  It's only the white people in the West that are to blame.
[02:29:34.574 --> 02:29:35.755]  They've got to be dealt with.
[02:29:35.755 --> 02:29:42.300]  And if an ESPN host says, hey, you know, you shouldn't have men in women's bathrooms, he gets fired.
[02:29:42.300 --> 02:29:48.064]  And then England has travel advisories to the US, but says go to the Muslim countries where they kill you if you're gay.
[02:29:48.064 --> 02:29:49.465]  We're on the march.
[02:29:49.465 --> 02:29:51.987]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:51.987 --> 02:29:54.669]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:58.993 --> 02:30:03.419]  Is the British government more worried about transgender bathrooms than ISIS?
[02:30:03.419 --> 02:30:10.768]  This week it emerged that ISIS was plotting to attack tourist beaches across Europe by posing as vendors and placing bombs under sunbeds.
[02:30:10.768 --> 02:30:17.917]  Meanwhile in North Carolina, people are being required by a new law to use public bathrooms that correspond with their biological gender.
[02:30:18.157 --> 02:30:24.800]  So, which grave threat to the Brits traveling overseas did the British Foreign Office decide to warn its citizens about?
[02:30:24.800 --> 02:30:33.244]  That's right, they wanted travelers to be aware of the controversial new bathroom laws in North Carolina and Mississippi before visiting the U.S.
[02:30:33.584 --> 02:30:39.730]  Thirty British citizens were slaughtered on a beach by ISIS jihadists in Tunisia less than a year ago.
[02:30:39.730 --> 02:30:43.934]  ISIS frequently calls for the execution of members of the LGBT community.
[02:30:43.934 --> 02:30:50.481]  The Foreign Office issues a warning about bathroom laws, yet ignores the terror threat to attack tourist beaches.
[02:30:50.481 --> 02:30:54.185]  For more on the absurdity, visit InfoWars.com right now.
[02:30:58.798 --> 02:30:59.439]  Uh, yeah.
[02:30:59.439 --> 02:31:05.263]  First of all, I want to say, Secret 12, X2, Supermail, Brain Force, Prostagard, Silver Bullet.
[02:31:05.263 --> 02:31:06.223]  I use them all.
[02:31:06.223 --> 02:31:07.204]  They're phenomenal.
[02:31:07.204 --> 02:31:07.945]  They work.
[02:31:07.945 --> 02:31:08.785]  Buy them, folks.
[02:31:08.785 --> 02:31:09.186]  Thank you, brother.
[02:31:09.186 --> 02:31:11.187]  I really thank you guys for putting those out there.
[02:31:11.187 --> 02:31:17.412]  I am a relatively short-time listener, and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine products.
[02:31:17.412 --> 02:31:19.413]  Welcome to the Info War.

[02:31:29.741 --> 02:31:30.662]  Let me ask you a question.
[02:31:30.662 --> 02:31:31.703]  Have they worked for you?
[02:31:31.703 --> 02:31:34.565]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[02:31:34.565 --> 02:31:35.626]  What products are you taking?

[02:31:44.214 --> 02:31:47.397]  And I just re-upped everything and I just went to Autofill.

[02:33:14.793 --> 02:33:17.475]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:33:17.475 --> 02:33:24.800]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:33:24.800 --> 02:33:27.982]  By the way, we've got the new Skeletal Defense out.

[02:33:44.957 --> 02:33:47.779]  And even if you're young, you should be taking this stuff.
[02:33:47.779 --> 02:33:55.483]  We've also got the new Make America Free Again hats that look strangely familiar to Donald Trump's hats, but they're made in America as well.
[02:33:55.483 --> 02:33:57.125]  On the back, it has the Gadsden flag.
[02:33:57.125 --> 02:33:59.006]  So they're definitely different, but I'm a fan of these hats.
[02:33:59.006 --> 02:34:02.188]  So we've got our own variant Make America Free Again hats.
[02:34:02.188 --> 02:34:04.609]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:34:04.609 --> 02:34:09.593]  And yes, we have the super high quality, totally organic, pure methylcobalamin vitamin B12.
[02:34:11.331 --> 02:34:14.294]  I just want to show some of these big studies and articles before this hour ends.
[02:34:14.294 --> 02:34:22.564]  I'm going to go to calls right now where they're admitting, oh, the gut of autistic children in major studies isn't uploading vitamin B12 and absorbing it.
[02:34:24.212 --> 02:34:27.534]  And so they're finding, you know, to treat autism early on, vitamin B12 shots.
[02:34:27.534 --> 02:34:34.657]  Well, if you take it sublingually, it goes into the blood vessels as well, and that's what we've got is basically the injectable type Secret 12.
[02:34:34.657 --> 02:34:36.037]  Don't inject this, folks.
[02:34:36.037 --> 02:34:43.501]  The point is, is that this is Secret 12, methylcobalamin, totally pure, and that's what Secret 12 is under the tongue.
[02:34:43.501 --> 02:34:46.142]  If you sit there for like a minute, a lot of it absorbs.
[02:34:46.142 --> 02:34:47.183]  I mean, I'm kind of just...
[02:34:48.302 --> 02:34:50.142]  A little bit wasteful on time, a little bit in a hurry.
[02:34:50.142 --> 02:34:54.343]  I kind of just put it under my tongue and slurp it down, but amazing energy.
[02:34:54.343 --> 02:34:55.104]  It's incredible.
[02:34:55.104 --> 02:34:56.004]  We'll talk about that later.
[02:34:56.004 --> 02:34:57.784]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:34:57.784 --> 02:35:00.125]  Infowarslife, one word.

[02:35:07.426 --> 02:35:13.748]  I want to go to Chaz in Israel, Peter in Washington, Jack in Colorado, Mike in Iowa,
[02:35:14.662 --> 02:35:19.785]  Renee in South Dakota and others, toll free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[02:35:19.785 --> 02:35:23.207]  So let's talk to Chaz in Israel.
[02:35:23.207 --> 02:35:25.769]  Chaz, welcome.
[02:35:25.769 --> 02:35:26.910]  Hey, do you hear me?
[02:35:26.910 --> 02:35:29.571]  Yes sir, go ahead.
[02:35:29.571 --> 02:35:35.015]  Alright, well, I'm from Saratoga County originally.
[02:35:37.646 --> 02:35:41.807]  I think that your show is the second battle of Saratoga.
[02:35:41.807 --> 02:35:45.388]  Like, the battle of Saratoga was the turning point of the Revolutionary War.
[02:35:45.388 --> 02:35:46.948]  That's what it's called.
[02:35:46.948 --> 02:36:04.652]  And the reason for that is because, um, you know, basically, you know, all the patriots, you know, they had kind of like given up, you know, all the chips were down and all that, you know, it looked like the British were going to win.
[02:36:04.652 --> 02:36:06.753]  But then George Washington
[02:36:07.594 --> 02:36:13.375]  You fucking, you know, kicked butt in Saratoga.
[02:36:13.375 --> 02:36:29.799]  And it actually got all the patriots to just kind of stand up and be like, hey... Sir, George Washington and others were a catalyst, and you're saying we're entering a same type of catalyst zone today.
[02:36:29.799 --> 02:36:35.120]  I know Palestinians in Israel, you know, I'm calling from Jaffa right now, and
[02:36:36.471 --> 02:36:43.615]  I know Palestinians in Israel that actually support Trump, you know, just over what he's said, you know.
[02:36:43.615 --> 02:36:56.543]  Well, Louis Farrakhan supports him because a Muslim that isn't wanting to engage in terrorism gets, if they're bringing in unvetted radicals, it's to stage terror attacks that'll then be blamed on Muslims in general, and they understand it's a false flag.
[02:36:56.543 --> 02:36:58.104]  It's a super false flag.
[02:36:58.104 --> 02:36:59.645]  Good to hear from you, Chas, in Israel.
[02:37:00.768 --> 02:37:03.210]  By the way, there's a new article up on InfoWars.com.
[02:37:03.210 --> 02:37:04.251]  I say new.
[02:37:04.251 --> 02:37:12.778]  I get so obsessed watching Drudge all day, which is incredibly accurate and constantly moving fast and, you know, important to watch, that I don't look at InfoWars.com.
[02:37:12.778 --> 02:37:13.939]  I'll just be honest.
[02:37:13.939 --> 02:37:15.381]  No teleprompter here.
[02:37:15.381 --> 02:37:16.141]  Pretty ridiculous statement.
[02:37:16.141 --> 02:37:16.602]  Look at Drudge.
[02:37:16.602 --> 02:37:18.223]  Not my own website.
[02:37:18.223 --> 02:37:19.344]  I need two more.
[02:37:19.344 --> 02:37:21.946]  Just the layout of Drudge is so easy to look at.
[02:37:21.946 --> 02:37:24.909]  Killery on using executive orders to take guns.
[02:37:24.909 --> 02:37:26.150]  Amen.
[02:37:26.150 --> 02:37:27.050]  This ties into
[02:37:28.766 --> 02:37:35.127]  Ties into Webster Hubble's daughter that Hillary had a child with, literally.
[02:37:35.127 --> 02:37:43.029]  Chelsea, the token child, saying, hey, we've gotten rid of Scalia, now we're moving forward to get the guns.
[02:37:43.029 --> 02:37:44.209]  Played that clip earlier.
[02:37:44.209 --> 02:37:46.169]  Hillary on using executive order to take guns.
[02:37:46.169 --> 02:37:46.830]  Amen.
[02:37:46.830 --> 02:37:52.491]  Supporter urges Clinton to take on the sons and daughters of Charlton Heston.
[02:37:52.491 --> 02:37:53.751]  Maybe put them in a forced labor camp.
[02:37:56.167 --> 02:37:58.450]  Oh, the poor people who live in Chicago, New York, D.C.
[02:37:58.450 --> 02:38:02.173]  and are used to being disarmed and think that if they disarm other people they'll be safe.
[02:38:02.173 --> 02:38:03.595]  So sad what slaves they are.
[02:38:03.595 --> 02:38:08.340]  We're going to get that video clip here in a few minutes and play that, but right now, let's go to Jack.
[02:38:08.340 --> 02:38:13.865]  Let's talk to Jack in Colorado, where they now have voterless elections for Ted Cruz.
[02:38:13.865 --> 02:38:15.707]  Jack, you're on the air.
[02:38:15.707 --> 02:38:17.329]  Yeah, that's correct.
[02:38:17.329 --> 02:38:19.031]  Yeah, just a quick comment, Alex.
[02:38:19.864 --> 02:38:27.938]  You know, if next time your reporters are out and they're talking to these climate change moron hypocrites, ask them if they recycle their own personal garbage.
[02:38:28.914 --> 02:38:29.615]  Exactly!
[02:38:29.615 --> 02:38:34.378]  It's all, listen, they had British and Canadian studies, as you know, a few years ago.
[02:38:34.378 --> 02:38:40.442]  Environmentalists are six times more likely to steal and even more likely to not give money to charity.
[02:38:40.442 --> 02:38:47.167]  Because they're just fakes and they're constantly looking for groupthink and to guilt other people into being their minions.
[02:38:47.167 --> 02:38:49.368]  They're basically sacks of pus.
[02:38:49.368 --> 02:38:50.829]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:38:50.829 --> 02:38:51.930]  That's right, you got it right.
[02:38:51.930 --> 02:38:52.350]  That's all.
[02:38:52.350 --> 02:38:53.491]  I just want to make that comment.
[02:38:53.491 --> 02:38:54.712]  If you're out there and you're making a
[02:38:55.270 --> 02:38:56.551]  A big stink about the climate.
[02:38:56.551 --> 02:38:58.714]  The first thing you need to do is do it at home first.
[02:38:58.714 --> 02:39:00.916]  Well, I agree, but let's expand.
[02:39:00.916 --> 02:39:06.403]  What's dead on arrival for them is that China, India, Mexico... I'm not against China, India and Mexico by the way.
[02:39:07.589 --> 02:39:11.552]  Those countries that globalists control have dirty coal-burning plants.
[02:39:11.552 --> 02:39:13.133]  They build new ones all the time.
[02:39:13.133 --> 02:39:14.514]  Nothing can compete with coal.
[02:39:14.514 --> 02:39:15.634]  It's everywhere.
[02:39:15.634 --> 02:39:20.638]  Half the Earth's landmass has coal under it.
[02:39:20.638 --> 02:39:22.319]  Thousands of years of coal.
[02:39:22.319 --> 02:39:24.240]  It puts out carbon dioxide we need.
[02:39:24.240 --> 02:39:28.223]  I mean, wow, boy, whoever made this planet knew what they were doing to give us an energy source.
[02:39:28.223 --> 02:39:34.387]  It's almost like they're aliens that run things that don't want us to have our main source that God gave us to get off the planet.
[02:39:34.387 --> 02:39:36.508]  We won't make it without coal, folks.
[02:39:36.508 --> 02:39:37.429]  We have to have it.
[02:39:39.170 --> 02:39:41.372]  And so they're targeting it.
[02:39:41.372 --> 02:39:48.456]  And so you just point out that 160 plus countries are exempt from carbon taxes, but we aren't and Europe isn't.
[02:39:48.456 --> 02:39:50.758]  It's discriminatory.
[02:39:50.758 --> 02:39:57.783]  They want us so politically correct that the number one right is to have some six foot guy, you know, with a wig on in the girl's bathroom.
[02:39:58.988 --> 02:40:01.130]  Whether that's good or bad, it's a total distraction.
[02:40:01.130 --> 02:40:02.671]  We're not Planet Tranny.
[02:40:02.671 --> 02:40:05.833]  You know, with some guy with a beard and a dress.
[02:40:05.833 --> 02:40:10.556]  So they divert us off while they're turning our power off, Jack.
[02:40:10.556 --> 02:40:10.917]  Right.
[02:40:10.917 --> 02:40:12.858]  Okay, Alex, thank you very much and God bless you.
[02:40:12.858 --> 02:40:13.719]  God bless you, brother.
[02:40:13.719 --> 02:40:15.040]  Great point.
[02:40:15.040 --> 02:40:16.761]  Let's go ahead and go to Peter.
[02:40:16.761 --> 02:40:18.202]  Peter in Washington.
[02:40:18.202 --> 02:40:21.184]  Go ahead, Peter, on the air.
[02:40:21.184 --> 02:40:24.126]  Hello, Alex.
[02:40:24.126 --> 02:40:25.867]  Three points, so I'll go quickly.
[02:40:25.867 --> 02:40:27.689]  First of all, took the liver program.
[02:40:28.506 --> 02:40:29.650]  It was a success.
[02:40:29.650 --> 02:40:34.486]  Secondly, I was for Trump ever since he announced the wall.
[02:40:35.194 --> 02:40:40.599]  Now, thirdly, and the main point, I would like to send you people a book.
[02:40:40.599 --> 02:40:49.729]  I won't give the title over the phone, but if they give me the PO Box or somebody does, I'll send it.
[02:40:49.729 --> 02:40:51.410]  I don't mind you saying the name of the book.
[02:40:51.410 --> 02:40:54.373]  Most shows censor everything you do and make you beg to get on air.
[02:40:54.373 --> 02:40:54.874]  I don't do that.
[02:40:54.874 --> 02:40:56.255]  You're a human just like I am.
[02:40:56.255 --> 02:40:57.176]  You can say the name of the book.
[02:40:57.176 --> 02:40:58.717]  I just want phone numbers and random names.
[02:40:59.458 --> 02:40:59.918]  That's right.
[02:41:19.882 --> 02:41:25.847]  And also, although it doesn't thematically discuss it very much, transhumanism.
[02:41:25.847 --> 02:41:34.935]  I think somebody in your... Sir, transhumanism is the enemy because it's directed by eugenicists from day one as an anti-human project.
[02:41:34.935 --> 02:41:45.504]  Sure, but I would like to send a copy of those two books to your company and if there's somebody there that... Sure, send them with a mark to Alex Jones.
[02:41:45.504 --> 02:41:45.945]  I'll look at them.
[02:41:45.945 --> 02:41:46.165]  Thank you.
[02:41:47.844 --> 02:41:50.365]  What's the address?
[02:41:50.365 --> 02:41:51.325]  I'll be quite frank with you.
[02:41:51.325 --> 02:41:52.946]  I don't have the PO Box memorized.
[02:41:52.946 --> 02:41:56.628]  Let's punch it up on screen, perhaps, in the order section of InfoWars.
[02:41:56.628 --> 02:41:59.490]  The store section should be there, and I can give folks the address.
[02:41:59.490 --> 02:42:04.533]  But overall, how do you define digitalism and transhumanism?
[02:42:04.533 --> 02:42:09.635]  I mean, that basically is a technotronic era, basically, correct?
[02:42:09.635 --> 02:42:10.376]  Yeah.
[02:42:10.376 --> 02:42:11.696]  Yeah.
[02:42:11.696 --> 02:42:13.337]  I don't discuss it very much.
[02:42:15.057 --> 02:42:18.420]  Because it, but I do a little bit.
[02:42:18.420 --> 02:42:19.681]  Let me see what I can find.
[02:42:19.681 --> 02:42:21.442]  Let me give you the address, brother.
[02:42:21.442 --> 02:42:22.022]  It's P.O.
[02:42:22.022 --> 02:42:23.243]  Box, P.O.
[02:42:23.243 --> 02:42:29.688]  Box, 1-9-5-4-9, Austin, Texas, 7-8-7-6-0.
[02:42:29.688 --> 02:42:34.952]  Formerly in Texas, FEMA Region 6 right now, but they still have the addresses of the state up, the schedule.
[02:42:34.952 --> 02:42:35.332]  P.O.
[02:42:35.332 --> 02:42:36.693]  Box, 1-9-5-4-9, Austin, Texas, 7-8-7-6-0.
[02:42:42.038 --> 02:42:43.842]  And there you go, my friend.
[02:42:43.842 --> 02:42:45.366]  I appreciate your call, Peter.
[02:42:45.366 --> 02:42:48.012]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:42:48.012 --> 02:42:50.418]  Let's talk to Maya in Kansas, then Renee and others.
[02:42:50.418 --> 02:42:51.220]  Maya, you're on the air.
[02:42:51.220 --> 02:42:51.501]  Go ahead.
[02:42:52.529 --> 02:42:55.551]  Hi, I'm going to make this quick as I possibly can.
[02:42:55.551 --> 02:42:59.393]  I'll say some here, but I very much would like to speak to someone.
[02:42:59.393 --> 02:43:10.078]  I came across some information that is making not only me but a few other people very nervous, and it has to do with the religious background of Glenn Beck and Ted Cruz.
[02:43:10.078 --> 02:43:17.442]  Now, whether or not these two men are aware of who they are and what powers they have in terms of their religion and their faith,
[02:43:17.982 --> 02:43:23.524]  I don't know, but I am very much familiar with Dominion theology.
[02:43:23.524 --> 02:43:24.944]  I was in the middle of it.
[02:43:24.944 --> 02:43:29.006]  I know everything from John Wimber to what's going on today.
[02:43:29.006 --> 02:43:39.369]  And when I saw Ted Cruz and Glenn Beck cozying up to each other, it made me nervous because I'm also aware of what Mormonism is.
[02:43:39.369 --> 02:43:45.271]  I did some research on the search engine and accidentally found myself on a page that not only
[02:43:47.586 --> 02:43:56.054]  Um, tracked my, um, URL back, but, uh, started sending me things.
[02:43:56.054 --> 02:44:05.342]  There's a lot of... Well, listen, it's admitted even by Politico that Ted Cruz uses the same computer programs Obama did that track and database anybody that visits their sites or goes to them.
[02:44:05.342 --> 02:44:06.543]  And it's super creepy.
[02:44:06.543 --> 02:44:08.225]  They know who you are when they come to your door.
[02:44:08.225 --> 02:44:09.366]  They have manipulative questions.
[02:44:09.366 --> 02:44:12.809]  The computer tells them to ask you to, to, like, you know, kind of like a, uh,
[02:44:14.848 --> 02:44:22.674]  Some of these psychics that are con artists, I'm not saying they're all are, but some of them, you know, they try to get your wallet first to see who you are, try to get intel on you.
[02:44:22.674 --> 02:44:23.655]  I mean, that's what they're doing.
[02:44:23.655 --> 02:44:24.396]  So it's super creepy.
[02:44:24.396 --> 02:44:30.701]  I don't want to get off into, you know, the whole dominionism thing that kind of expands on manifest destiny and providence and things.
[02:44:30.701 --> 02:44:34.984]  And I would say it's a counterfeit of some real issues that are out there.
[02:44:34.984 --> 02:44:38.807]  But it's kind of like the riddle of Calvinism or something as well.
[02:44:38.807 --> 02:44:42.350]  It's like, you can be predestined, but you have free will, you have to decide to do that.
[02:44:42.970 --> 02:44:49.117]  But he kind of expands out in the modern new age sense into kind of like Oprah Winfrey, name it and claim it, the secret.
[02:44:49.117 --> 02:44:51.640]  You don't just say you want something, believe it, and it happens.
[02:44:52.310 --> 02:44:52.970]  Okay?
[02:44:52.970 --> 02:44:59.073]  You have to have will behind that, history, energy, things that are already in place, and then that can be manifest.
[02:44:59.073 --> 02:45:04.456]  But you can have evil will behind you and then manifest it, or good will behind you and manifest it.
[02:45:04.456 --> 02:45:06.177]  These people don't understand what they're even dealing with.
[02:45:06.177 --> 02:45:07.958]  It's very, very dangerous stuff.
[02:45:07.958 --> 02:45:10.659]  And it's what the Bible says, don't be involved in sorcery.
[02:45:10.659 --> 02:45:17.963]  I just say everything's God's will, I'm going to tell the truth and move forward, and if God wants to protect me, or open the doors up for me to move forward, it's going to happen.
[02:45:19.670 --> 02:45:25.076]  But yes, these people want to set themselves up as if they're in charge of God, and God's their little errand boy.
[02:45:25.076 --> 02:45:28.459]  That's not how God operates.
[02:45:28.459 --> 02:45:30.481]  Anything else, ma'am?
[02:45:30.481 --> 02:45:31.782]  She hung up.
[02:45:31.782 --> 02:45:33.384]  All right, David in New Mexico.
[02:45:33.384 --> 02:45:34.665]  David, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:45:34.665 --> 02:45:36.527]  Go ahead.
[02:45:36.527 --> 02:45:37.448]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:45:37.448 --> 02:45:38.429]  Great show as usual.
[02:45:38.429 --> 02:45:39.971]  I just had two quick points to make here.
[02:45:40.775 --> 02:45:50.239]  The first is that there is a website, it's called petitionproject.org, that has over 31,000 scientists that say that global warming and climate change caused by man is a fraud.
[02:45:50.239 --> 02:45:51.419]  It's petitionproject.org.
[02:45:51.419 --> 02:45:53.440]  Well, it's total horse manure.
[02:45:53.440 --> 02:45:54.320]  But here's the problem.
[02:45:54.320 --> 02:45:57.962]  They are secretly geoengineering and changing the climate, and it's secret.
[02:45:57.962 --> 02:45:58.922]  They won't tell us.
[02:45:58.922 --> 02:46:04.024]  So it looks like they may be messing it up to then guilt trip everyone and make us pay them money.
[02:46:04.024 --> 02:46:06.065]  I mean, how transparent is that?
[02:46:08.433 --> 02:46:11.356]  Well, I hear where you're coming from, but I'd like you just to check it out.
[02:46:11.356 --> 02:46:14.038]  There's over 9,000 PhDs on that site.
[02:46:14.038 --> 02:46:15.559]  I am aware of it, sir, absolutely.
[02:46:15.559 --> 02:46:25.288]  Oh, listen, the majority of hydrologists and meteorologists and astrophysicists all say man-made climate change is as phony as a $3 bill.
[02:46:25.288 --> 02:46:30.012]  I mean, we probably contribute maybe one-half of a percent, some of the algorithms show.
[02:46:30.012 --> 02:46:33.375]  But just, we're like an ant on a hippo's butt, baby.
[02:46:33.835 --> 02:46:36.259]  I mean, we are not running the show here.
[02:46:36.259 --> 02:46:41.788]  That big old giant fireball shooting out flamethrowers 10,000 times the size of the earth?
[02:46:41.788 --> 02:46:43.030]  That sucker's running the show.
[02:46:43.030 --> 02:46:45.134]  Go ahead.
[02:46:45.134 --> 02:46:46.436]  That's absolutely true.
[02:46:46.436 --> 02:46:48.199]  Second point here, as a structural engineer,
[02:46:49.112 --> 02:46:56.157]  I was curious if there's any way you guys could maybe contact Roger Stone or Donald Trump and mention the Architects and Engineers for 9-11 Truth.
[02:46:56.157 --> 02:46:58.559]  Now there's 2,506 signed up.
[02:46:58.559 --> 02:47:00.100]  I know, I know.
[02:47:00.100 --> 02:47:01.721]  Yeah, I mean, here's the deal.
[02:47:01.721 --> 02:47:04.423]  Trump is not dumbing it down, but he's doing it in basic gestalts.
[02:47:05.143 --> 02:47:08.925]  People aren't even ready to hear Saudi Arabia and criminal elements ran the attack.
[02:47:08.925 --> 02:47:11.966]  That comes out, whole house of cards comes down.
[02:47:11.966 --> 02:47:13.186]  Clearly there were bombs in the building.
[02:47:13.186 --> 02:47:16.588]  We pioneered exposing all that with groups.
[02:47:16.588 --> 02:47:17.668]  I love architects and engineers.
[02:47:17.668 --> 02:47:25.572]  People always tell me about them and I was around like five years before they existed and actually first had Gage on and promoted it all and had him on C-SPAN and all the rest of it.
[02:47:27.461 --> 02:47:30.043]  I just learned that people aren't going to get that part.
[02:47:30.043 --> 02:47:37.288]  They're going to get the NORAD staying down, the government using the attacks to take our liberties, the government behind ISIS and Al Qaeda.
[02:47:37.288 --> 02:47:40.830]  And once I've got them there, the doors open, I'm going to bring them down.
[02:47:40.830 --> 02:47:42.291]  And so that's my plan.
[02:47:42.291 --> 02:47:42.772]  But I hear you.
[02:47:42.772 --> 02:47:43.792]  We still do those shows.
[02:47:43.792 --> 02:47:45.573]  We still talk about the bombs in the building.
[02:47:45.573 --> 02:47:47.915]  We still cover the whole nine yards, brother.
[02:47:47.915 --> 02:47:48.656]  And you're absolutely right.
[02:47:48.656 --> 02:47:51.918]  But isn't it exciting to see Donald Trump talking about the 28 pages?
[02:47:53.772 --> 02:47:57.955]  It's very exciting and you know what's even more exciting is how prescient you were at the time.
[02:47:57.955 --> 02:48:11.426]  I looked up your archives and I saw that on the day of 9-11 you actually had a structural engineer on your show and you were actually interviewing him and he was discussing the demolitions that day so it's amazing how you've been on top of these things from the beginning and you're doing a great job.
[02:48:11.426 --> 02:48:13.648]  Well I'm not bragging, I never really told this story.
[02:48:15.555 --> 02:48:17.396]  Because they'll make a big deal out of the media and attack people.
[02:48:17.396 --> 02:48:19.316]  But I've always said people have a sixth sense.
[02:48:19.316 --> 02:48:20.036]  Everybody's got it.
[02:48:20.036 --> 02:48:21.217]  It depends how strong it is.
[02:48:21.217 --> 02:48:24.598]  I had dreams about the towers blowing up before it happened for about six months.
[02:48:24.598 --> 02:48:28.559]  And it got so bad that two months before I went on air and said they're going to blow up the World Trade Center.
[02:48:28.559 --> 02:48:32.000]  I mean, it's on local TV and people can look up Alex Jones predicts 9-11.
[02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:35.241]  And I said they're going to blow up the World Trade Center and blame it on Bin Laden.
[02:48:35.241 --> 02:48:36.522]  I mean, I just, people can say, well,
[02:48:37.295 --> 02:48:39.015]  I mean, it's on record I did that.
[02:48:39.015 --> 02:48:48.798]  That show, because I did it live that day, re-aired on September 11th by a twist of fate at night, because I do a live show and then turn it in and air like four more times on AXS television.
[02:48:48.798 --> 02:48:53.019]  I was already syndicated radio host, but I was still doing AXS TV and using it as a studio.
[02:48:53.019 --> 02:48:59.321]  I mean, I had dreams and towers of smoke, all of it.
[02:48:59.321 --> 02:49:01.222]  It's just real, folks.
[02:49:01.222 --> 02:49:05.743]  There's more on heaven and earth than in all your books, to quote Shakespeare.
[02:49:08.976 --> 02:49:12.318]  I don't remember most of my dreams, but I've had a good 10 or 15.
[02:49:12.318 --> 02:49:14.419]  I remember that, that were so crystal clear.
[02:49:14.419 --> 02:49:16.300]  You feel sick when you wake up for them.
[02:49:16.300 --> 02:49:19.162]  It's like you've, you've, you've been somewhere.
[02:49:19.162 --> 02:49:22.984]  And those dreams, by the time I was like 15, I learned, wow, those dreams come true.
[02:49:22.984 --> 02:49:32.309]  So when I'd have one of those waking, sickening dreams, or I woke up nauseated with sweat all over me that, Oh my God, I just, I just, you know, went somewhere or something just happened.
[02:49:32.309 --> 02:49:34.991]  And I learned to fear those dreams.
[02:49:34.991 --> 02:49:35.511]  And, uh,
[02:49:38.021 --> 02:49:41.422]  I've been having some bad ones lately, I'll tell you right now.
[02:49:41.422 --> 02:49:44.243]  Those are possible futures, though, people.
[02:49:44.243 --> 02:49:51.845]  And we don't have to go there, but I'm telling you, the people running this show are coming to kill a lot of folks.
[02:49:51.845 --> 02:49:53.866]  So, it's the truth.
[02:49:53.866 --> 02:50:02.709]  I don't want to get up here and talk about devil worship the first hour and Prince hiding out because he was so scared of it, but that's what he told Mankell, Eric Mueller.
[02:50:03.976 --> 02:50:14.022]  I don't want to get up here and talk about dreams that came true, but I mean, you think I just went on TV and said they're going to blow up the World Trade Center and blame it on Bin Laden and invade Afghanistan and take our liberties?
[02:50:14.022 --> 02:50:15.883]  You think I just figured that out on my own?
[02:50:15.883 --> 02:50:18.285]  I had dreams about it.
[02:50:18.285 --> 02:50:20.286]  Dreams where I would get up and go vomit.
[02:50:21.513 --> 02:50:22.854]  And those are the only dreams I have.
[02:50:22.854 --> 02:50:26.316]  When I know my dream's real, I get up, I'm sick, I'm sweating, and I gotta puke.
[02:50:26.316 --> 02:50:28.357]  Because it's like something's happened.
[02:50:28.357 --> 02:50:32.059]  My brain, inter-dimensionally, whatever, it's like jumped ahead or something, time-traveled.
[02:50:32.059 --> 02:50:33.440]  And it's horrible.
[02:50:33.440 --> 02:50:34.801]  It's not fun.
[02:50:34.801 --> 02:50:37.623]  And it's only bad stuff, by the way.
[02:50:37.623 --> 02:50:40.945]  I probably shouldn't even tell these stories.
[02:50:40.945 --> 02:50:41.245]  You know what?
[02:50:41.245 --> 02:50:42.766]  I don't care if the media makes fun of it.
[02:50:42.766 --> 02:50:45.848]  It's the truth, and that's just what it is, okay?
[02:50:45.848 --> 02:50:46.788]  I've had some other dreams.
[02:50:49.295 --> 02:50:53.778]  They deal with mushroom clouds and millions of people starving to death.
[02:50:53.778 --> 02:50:56.220]  And I just hope those don't come true.
[02:50:56.220 --> 02:50:56.640]  We'll be back.

[02:54:15.968 --> 02:54:19.533]  Alright, this video for six hours has been making the rounds on the internet.
[02:54:19.533 --> 02:54:20.855]  I don't know if it's photoshopped.
[02:54:20.855 --> 02:54:22.077]  I don't know if it's fake.
[02:54:22.077 --> 02:54:23.278]  It's video.
[02:54:23.278 --> 02:54:24.741]  It looks pretty darn real.
[02:54:24.741 --> 02:54:32.351]  It looks like Ted Cruz is in Hershey, Pennsylvania, passing someone what looks like a folded $100 bill or a couple hundred dollar bills.
[02:54:33.283 --> 02:54:34.784]  It's hard to make out.
[02:54:34.784 --> 02:54:36.065]  It looks real.
[02:54:36.065 --> 02:54:36.945]  I'm a video guy.
[02:54:36.945 --> 02:54:40.127]  I don't know if this is real or not.
[02:54:40.127 --> 02:54:42.509]  This was on NBC Nightly News.
[02:54:42.509 --> 02:54:47.512]  Just a clip blown up and then he is handing someone money.
[02:54:47.512 --> 02:54:51.095]  Let's skip all that and let's just say this is a hoax.
[02:54:51.095 --> 02:54:51.295]  Okay?
[02:54:51.295 --> 02:54:53.016]  Because the media will say I'm saying this.
[02:54:53.016 --> 02:54:54.157]  No, this is on the internet.
[02:54:54.157 --> 02:54:56.058]  This is being claimed.
[02:54:56.058 --> 02:55:00.741]  He has had the Republicans cancel elections in five states and in six other states where
[02:55:03.447 --> 02:55:05.969]  Donald Trump has won.
[02:55:05.969 --> 02:55:11.735]  They are giving the votes to Ted Cruz and he's winning.
[02:55:11.735 --> 02:55:14.617]  Same thing with Hillary in New Hampshire and so many other states.
[02:55:14.617 --> 02:55:17.380]  So I don't need to know if this is real or not.
[02:55:17.380 --> 02:55:19.702]  I know he's doing it.
[02:55:19.702 --> 02:55:25.067]  But we'll put the video up on Infowars.com right now for everybody to see it and you can make the decision for yourself.
[02:55:26.857 --> 02:55:29.019]  I know it's one of the sites on YouTube it was.
[02:55:29.019 --> 02:55:30.321]  It's one of the things they always talk about.
[02:55:30.321 --> 02:55:34.505]  Look, Trump just retweeted a white nationalist site or something and it's one of those.
[02:55:34.505 --> 02:55:36.487]  So that's usually government stuff.
[02:55:36.487 --> 02:55:39.790]  So this may be fake.
[02:55:39.790 --> 02:55:40.991]  We'll see.
[02:55:40.991 --> 02:55:43.514]  But if it is, the average person couldn't fake this.
[02:55:43.514 --> 02:55:44.875]  This looks very, very real.
[02:55:44.875 --> 02:55:47.798]  Money's behind the thing and it comes out from behind it.
[02:55:47.798 --> 02:55:48.179]  Who knows?
[02:55:48.179 --> 02:55:50.061]  We're going to track the whole deal and find out exactly.
[02:55:51.578 --> 02:55:52.498]  What's going on?
[02:55:52.498 --> 02:55:54.439]  The Hillary audio is not very good on this.
[02:55:54.439 --> 02:55:58.161]  I'm not going to air it on radio because it may not translate on AM radio.
[02:55:58.161 --> 02:56:00.482]  But Hillary on using executive orders to take guns.
[02:56:00.482 --> 02:56:01.342]  Amen.
[02:56:01.342 --> 02:56:05.044]  Supporter urges Clinton take on the sons and daughters of Charlton Heston.
[02:56:05.044 --> 02:56:07.105]  But there's a separate clip of her out there.
[02:56:07.105 --> 02:56:08.406]  Chelsea saying take the guns.
[02:56:08.406 --> 02:56:09.706]  You know, we've got the Supreme Court now.
[02:56:09.706 --> 02:56:10.907]  It's great that Scalia's dead.
[02:56:10.907 --> 02:56:12.187]  All the rest of it.
[02:56:12.187 --> 02:56:15.569]  But here's Hillary saying we just have too many guns on ABC.
[02:56:15.569 --> 02:56:16.829]  Here it is.
[02:56:16.829 --> 02:56:17.950]  And when it comes to guns,
[02:56:20.191 --> 02:56:25.214]  We have just too many guns on the streets, in our homes, in our neighborhoods.
[02:56:25.214 --> 02:56:26.615]  What about the Benghazi stand-down?
[02:56:26.615 --> 02:56:28.856]  Al-Qaeda had some guns, didn't they, Sweetcake?
[02:56:28.856 --> 02:56:30.097]  You helped get them, Sweetcake.
[02:56:30.097 --> 02:56:38.402]  You know, there's been a lot of talk in this campaign, in the primary campaign, about the power of certain interests in our country.
[02:56:38.402 --> 02:56:40.323]  And we do have a bunch of powerful interests.
[02:56:40.323 --> 02:56:43.605]  Oh, she's battling special interests, aww.
[02:56:43.605 --> 02:56:45.806]  But there is no more powerful lobby.
[02:56:47.379 --> 02:56:49.061]  Because people stand behind it.
[02:56:49.061 --> 02:56:49.702]  Which?
[02:56:49.702 --> 02:56:50.663]  We're not your slave yet.
[02:56:50.663 --> 02:56:50.984]  Which?
[02:56:50.984 --> 02:56:51.644]  Not yet.
[02:56:51.644 --> 02:57:00.915]  You may shut off our power plants, teach our kids how to, you know, give blowjobs when they're five years old and all the rest of it, but you don't fully control the country yet, you stinking pile of horse manure.
[02:57:01.804 --> 02:57:03.184]  Oh, I hate that woman.
[02:57:03.184 --> 02:57:04.505]  Get the Hillary for Prison shirts.
[02:57:04.505 --> 02:57:05.325]  Wear them.
[02:57:05.325 --> 02:57:07.665]  Get the Make America Free again.
[02:57:07.665 --> 02:57:09.366]  Ball caps.
[02:57:09.366 --> 02:57:11.486]  We've got the Methylcobalamin.
[02:57:11.486 --> 02:57:13.327]  Super high quality vitamin B12 back in.
[02:57:13.327 --> 02:57:16.387]  I'm going to do five more minutes to take calls in the next segment and hand the baton to Gucciardi.
[02:57:16.387 --> 02:57:18.668]  Let me just show you these headlines right here today.
[02:57:18.668 --> 02:57:20.668]  Let's just do that right now for TV viewers.
[02:57:20.668 --> 02:57:23.049]  Radio listeners, here are the headlines.
[02:57:23.049 --> 02:57:23.749]  U.S.
[02:57:23.749 --> 02:57:25.990]  suicide rate surge to 30-year high.
[02:57:25.990 --> 02:57:27.490]  Highest ever recorded for military.
[02:57:28.050 --> 02:57:29.271]  Hmm, wonder why that is.
[02:57:29.271 --> 02:57:33.614]  The low B12 seen in aging, autism, and schizophrenia.
[02:57:33.614 --> 02:57:36.976]  Life Science News, bunch of other publications.
[02:57:36.976 --> 02:57:50.244]  This is put out by the prestigious journal of PLOS One, whole bunch of scientists, top scientists, major universities, about the fact that everybody autistic they looked at had the B12 levels of an old person.
[02:57:50.244 --> 02:57:51.365]  It goes down as you get older.
[02:57:51.365 --> 02:57:55.608]  B12 is the fundamental building block of everything in your body.
[02:57:57.469 --> 02:58:02.133]  And your stomachs, because of what they've done to us with the food, aren't absorbing.
[02:58:02.133 --> 02:58:05.897]  You don't absorb any, you become totally brain-damaged.
[02:58:05.897 --> 02:58:09.680]  You absorb not enough, you just become dumbed down.
[02:58:09.680 --> 02:58:11.882]  We've got the best medical bottlemen out there for my research.
[02:58:11.882 --> 02:58:13.544]  Totally organic, totally absorbable.

[03:00:04.639 --> 03:00:05.660]  Another time.
[03:00:05.660 --> 03:00:06.520]  Another time.
[03:00:06.520 --> 03:00:09.722]  In the Age of Wonder!
[03:00:09.722 --> 03:00:12.604]  In the Age of Wonder.
[03:00:12.604 --> 03:00:14.766]  You remember it, don't you?
[03:00:28.505 --> 03:00:44.499]  Alright, let's jam in some final phone calls before I hand the baton to Anthony Guicciardi, who always does a great job.
[03:00:44.499 --> 03:00:46.841]  The Not Only News is back tonight, 7 o'clock Central.
[03:00:46.841 --> 03:00:50.865]  We'll be back this Sunday, Lord willing, 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:00:50.865 --> 03:00:51.245]  Central.
[03:00:54.156 --> 03:00:58.098]  Mike in Iowa, you're on the air, thanks for holding.
[03:00:58.098 --> 03:00:58.778]  Sure.
[03:00:58.778 --> 03:01:00.679]  Hey, do you hear me?
[03:01:00.679 --> 03:01:02.319]  Yes, sir.
[03:01:02.319 --> 03:01:04.720]  Yes, I hope to see you in Cleveland.
[03:01:04.720 --> 03:01:05.460]  Oh, you will.
[03:01:05.460 --> 03:01:07.181]  I hope to see you there.
[03:01:07.181 --> 03:01:08.802]  I will be there for sure.
[03:01:08.802 --> 03:01:12.763]  And I had an issue with this global warming and the whole lie of global warming.
[03:01:12.763 --> 03:01:17.545]  What, the folks that want to make you feel guilty so they can tax you and run your life like a bunch of pimps?
[03:01:17.545 --> 03:01:19.706]  Right, because I'm flat-earthed.
[03:01:20.191 --> 03:01:22.532]  Because we are not on a globe.
[03:01:22.532 --> 03:01:23.512]  We are not on a sphere.
[03:01:23.512 --> 03:01:24.813]  We are on a flat Earth.
[03:01:24.813 --> 03:01:28.314]  Well, as much as the media lies, I don't blame you for saying that, but I mean, we got satellites.
[03:01:28.314 --> 03:01:28.934]  They've been around.
[03:01:28.934 --> 03:01:36.397]  I know people that are pilots have flown around the world, and a lot of folks that say we're a flat Earth, I know that's part of a little kind of an inside joke thing, but you know what?
[03:01:36.397 --> 03:01:45.840]  As much as the media lies and Obama says 2 plus 2 equals 5, if Obama's right about 2 plus 2 equaling 5 or raising the debt limit doesn't raise the debt limit, then I agree with you.
[03:01:45.840 --> 03:01:47.841]  The Earth is flat and it's made out of cheese.
[03:01:47.841 --> 03:01:48.561]  I appreciate your call.
[03:01:49.380 --> 03:01:50.543]  That was a good one right there.
[03:01:50.543 --> 03:01:52.246]  Love the prank callers.
[03:01:52.246 --> 03:01:54.271]  Renee in South Dakota, you're on the air.
[03:01:54.271 --> 03:01:54.652]  Go ahead.
[03:01:54.652 --> 03:01:56.917]  Hello?
[03:01:56.917 --> 03:01:57.258]  Yes, ma'am.
[03:01:58.709 --> 03:02:02.292]  Yeah, I'm having trouble with Chase Bank.
[03:02:02.292 --> 03:02:03.993]  They do not have to follow law.
[03:02:03.993 --> 03:02:06.535]  No eviction papers.
[03:02:06.535 --> 03:02:07.236]  Yes, ma'am.
[03:02:07.236 --> 03:02:12.199]  The big banks, Bank of America, all of them have been caught taking houses they never had a mortgage on, ma'am.
[03:02:12.199 --> 03:02:14.381]  I mean, they're taking houses that are 150 years old.
[03:02:14.381 --> 03:02:16.583]  The feds are taking ranches 130 years old.
[03:02:16.583 --> 03:02:19.345]  They're just running around with machine guns foaming at the mouth right now, yeah.
[03:02:20.435 --> 03:02:23.817]  They removed my electrical service from the house to force me out.
[03:02:23.817 --> 03:02:28.199]  They're using a local realtor that changed the locks illegally.
[03:02:28.199 --> 03:02:29.139]  I know.
[03:02:29.139 --> 03:02:30.140]  I ran into this in Austin.
[03:02:30.140 --> 03:02:35.202]  I found groups of realtors with the key people in the cities going after old folks.
[03:02:35.202 --> 03:02:37.424]  They have a database in the health department.
[03:02:37.424 --> 03:02:43.307]  When an old person had a heart attack or cancer surgery, was in bad trouble, was a widow or widower, they send them in to harass them with fines.
[03:02:44.443 --> 03:02:50.869]  Arrest them, make them sign the papers, and a lot of times they just get magically euthanized and they get the house.
[03:02:50.869 --> 03:02:52.090]  So, yes ma'am, I've seen it.
[03:02:52.090 --> 03:02:53.711]  It's a dangerous racket.
[03:02:53.711 --> 03:02:57.935]  But don't worry, everybody engaged in that's got a big-ass millstone tied around their neck.
[03:02:57.935 --> 03:02:59.496]  I appreciate your call, Rene.
[03:02:59.496 --> 03:03:01.257]  Tim in Wyoming, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:03:01.257 --> 03:03:04.781]  Hi Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[03:03:04.781 --> 03:03:07.463]  Now, I just wanted to mention a couple quick things.
[03:03:07.463 --> 03:03:10.345]  You talk about your vast storehouse of
[03:03:11.770 --> 03:03:22.518]  I've read books and what not, but I'm wondering, there's a book that I read years ago, before I ever even heard of you, called The Bridge, by an author called D. Keith Mono, M-A-N-O.
[03:03:22.518 --> 03:03:31.625]  Well, I don't know about my vast store, I don't know a fraction of the knowledge in this world, I'm ignorant, compared to, you know, some folks that read books all day, so I haven't heard of that book.
[03:03:31.625 --> 03:03:33.726]  Tell us about it.
[03:03:33.726 --> 03:03:38.010]  Well, what I'm saying, I mean, essentially the book, you know, when you're talking about the things that are happening, as in
[03:03:38.789 --> 03:03:46.052]  Free speech or actual speech itself, human talk, human speech, being a crime essentially.
[03:03:46.052 --> 03:03:47.552]  Oh yeah, they're waging war.
[03:03:47.552 --> 03:03:54.275]  They're now saying it's racist to speak with proper diction or proper enunciation in England.
[03:03:54.275 --> 03:03:57.316]  They're now saying that language itself is a conspiracy theory.
[03:03:58.991 --> 03:04:23.252]  Well, great, but in this book now, the very beginning of the book starts off with the person, the people are not able to talk, they're not able to use their vocal cords at all, they're not able to make a sound, and the earth has been basically literally taken over by bacteria, viruses, and animals, and no matter what happens to your human body, you're supposed to just die and rot away and let whatever take over.
[03:04:23.252 --> 03:04:24.393]  The book essentially is
[03:04:25.143 --> 03:04:27.865]  It's about the ultimate end of environmentalism.
[03:04:27.865 --> 03:04:30.507]  Well, that's what they mean, sir, but that's for us.
[03:04:30.507 --> 03:04:37.912]  They're going to be in the high-tech reservations with all the technology and all the goods, and we die because Obama gets red carpets and jumbo jets, the Africans die.
[03:04:37.912 --> 03:04:39.093]  It's very liberal.
[03:04:39.093 --> 03:04:41.815]  You know, like Al Gore coming out and saying, you know, exterminate blacks.
[03:04:41.815 --> 03:04:42.916]  It's liberal, sir.
[03:04:42.916 --> 03:04:45.898]  You know, if you're an actual Nazi, the ADL gives you awards.
[03:04:45.898 --> 03:04:47.059]  So yes, you're on to something there.
[03:04:47.059 --> 03:04:47.879]  I'll try to check it out.
[03:04:47.879 --> 03:04:48.160]  Thank you.
[03:04:48.700 --> 03:04:50.561]  Now that you mention it, I vaguely heard of that.
[03:04:50.561 --> 03:04:53.942]  We got callers on Larry Pratt, callers on vaccines and more.
[03:04:53.942 --> 03:04:55.242]  Anthony Gugiardi's coming up.
[03:04:55.242 --> 03:04:55.922]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:04:55.922 --> 03:04:58.963]  I'll see you this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:04:58.963 --> 03:05:06.345]  A recent story by the Financial Times confirms that Daesh, also known as the Islamic State, was created in part by the Saudis.
[03:05:06.345 --> 03:05:13.207]  According to the late Saudi foreign minister, Islamic State was cobbled together in response to the Shia government in Iraq following the U.S.
[03:05:13.207 --> 03:05:16.148]  invasion of the country and the execution of Saddam Hussein.
[03:05:16.308 --> 03:05:24.995]  The story ignores the fact the Saudis collaborated with the CIA and Pakistani intelligence to create the Afghan Arabs, which would become Al-Qaeda.
[03:05:24.995 --> 03:05:32.862]  Other factions of the CIA organized and Saudi-funded Mujahideen coalesced into another fanatical Wahhabi group, the Taliban.
[03:05:32.862 --> 03:05:38.407]  In 2006, Al-Qaeda and Iraq merged with several other Sunni Wahhabi groups to form the Islamic State of Iraq.
[03:05:38.407 --> 03:05:40.148]  When the group moved into Syria in 2013, it became ISIS.
[03:05:42.270 --> 03:05:49.420]  The missing 28 pages will allegedly show Saudi complicity in the 9-11 attacks, but it will not show the role played by the CIA.
[03:05:49.420 --> 03:05:54.708]  The same can be said for the role played by the CIA and the Pentagon in the creation of terrorist groups.
[03:05:54.708 --> 03:05:57.011]  Read more right now at InfoWars.com
[03:05:58.504 --> 03:06:09.048]  You're investing in your health and supporting the InfoWar when you visit InfoWarsLife.com and purchase your supply of Survival Shield X2 Nation Iodine and all the great products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:06:09.048 --> 03:06:14.969]  As you know, we've talked to pharmacists, chemists, doctors, researchers, scientists, and the answer is clear.
[03:06:14.969 --> 03:06:16.070]  Iodine is key.
[03:06:16.530 --> 03:06:22.197]  Paramount, and there's still so much new information coming out that we simply can't even keep up with it.
[03:06:22.197 --> 03:06:31.148]  In our quest for the purest iodine, we drilled down more than 7,000 feet to gather these purple-blue crystals to extract the ultra-pure iodine.
[03:06:31.148 --> 03:06:31.809]  On top of that,
[03:06:31.929 --> 03:06:35.051]  We also screen our iodine for radiation before bottling.
[03:06:35.051 --> 03:06:37.873]  It is the purest, cleanest, strongest out there.
[03:06:37.873 --> 03:06:50.801]  Quite frankly, I'm flattered that with the launch of Survival Shield nascent iodine, that major brands and major companies have been knocking down our doors to get our formula and that they have been unable to come up with anything even close to what we have.
[03:06:50.801 --> 03:06:57.726]  It is exclusive to Infowarslife.com and the Infowarslife family of incredible products.
[03:06:58.326 --> 03:07:00.407]  Brainforce, it's completely different.
[03:07:00.407 --> 03:07:01.627]  Try a bottle of it.
[03:07:01.627 --> 03:07:03.208]  Rob Dew joins us.
[03:07:03.208 --> 03:07:06.329]  You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours.
[03:07:06.329 --> 03:07:07.429]  Tell us what Brainforce did.
[03:07:07.429 --> 03:07:08.369]  I've been working all day.
[03:07:08.369 --> 03:07:10.870]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[03:07:10.870 --> 03:07:12.271]  I get in here at 830.
[03:07:12.271 --> 03:07:14.171]  I was kind of run down.
[03:07:14.171 --> 03:07:15.892]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was gonna make it.
[03:07:16.112 --> 03:07:17.994]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[03:07:17.994 --> 03:07:19.815]  I got my bottle of Brain Force right there.
[03:07:19.815 --> 03:07:20.876]  I popped two of them.
[03:07:20.876 --> 03:07:23.158]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like, bing!
[03:07:23.158 --> 03:07:24.959]  Everything just kind of clears up.
[03:07:24.959 --> 03:07:26.621]  It's got four and a half stars.
[03:07:26.621 --> 03:07:27.962]  People really love it.
[03:07:27.962 --> 03:07:28.562]  Read about it.
[03:07:28.562 --> 03:07:32.386]  Find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise.
[03:07:32.386 --> 03:07:37.670]  Because it really does have the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off.
[03:07:37.850 --> 03:07:41.895]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without Brain Force.
[03:07:41.895 --> 03:07:48.042]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brain Force and came in.
[03:07:48.042 --> 03:07:53.949]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:08:05.387 --> 03:08:10.788]  They call us walking corpses, unholy living dead.
[03:08:10.788 --> 03:08:14.829]  They'd like to lock us up, put us in their pretty pens.
[03:08:14.829 --> 03:08:21.790]  On Corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[03:08:21.790 --> 03:08:32.993]  I don't want to be in your British hell.
[03:08:32.993 --> 03:08:34.353]  Ain't no mystery.
[03:08:37.955 --> 03:08:43.837]  Why I'm in misery!
[03:08:43.837 --> 03:08:45.838]  They call us walking corpses.
[03:08:45.838 --> 03:08:46.878]  Unholy living dead.
[03:08:46.878 --> 03:08:48.138]  Crank it up!
[03:08:48.138 --> 03:08:54.020]  This is music to listen to when you're blasting down the highway.
[03:08:54.020 --> 03:08:57.741]  In an Al Gore approved 780 horsepower car.
[03:08:57.741 --> 03:09:01.583]  Then you hit the nitrous oxide.
[03:09:01.583 --> 03:09:02.743]  Those are risks we shouldn't be taking.
[03:09:02.743 --> 03:09:04.844]  That's why we don't.
[03:09:04.844 --> 03:09:05.184]  Anymore.
[03:09:07.239 --> 03:09:11.965]  Ain't no mystery!
[03:09:11.965 --> 03:09:14.728]  Why I'm in misery!
[03:09:14.728 --> 03:09:19.794]  I'm gonna hand the baton to Anthony Giardi here in about two minutes.
[03:09:23.123 --> 03:09:30.686]  But since we're getting into this, as Queen turns 90, report values British monarchy at $844,884 billion.
[03:09:30.686 --> 03:09:32.486]  See, I'm having a Freudian slip.
[03:09:32.486 --> 03:09:37.108]  As the Queen turns 90, report values British monarchy at $84 billion.
[03:09:37.108 --> 03:09:40.729]  See, I have trouble even saying a lie when it's not my lie.
[03:09:40.729 --> 03:09:43.190]  These people are worth trillions.
[03:09:43.190 --> 03:09:47.031]  And Obama is over there groveling to them right now.
[03:09:47.031 --> 03:09:49.472]  Happy belated birthday, your majesty!
[03:09:50.979 --> 03:10:00.704]  Obama lunches with the Queen as the storm over the British exit of the EU rages on.
[03:10:00.704 --> 03:10:12.049]  And Boris Johnson, who's a social liberal, but does point out the EU doesn't pay taxes, the bureaucrats don't, that it makes now 90 plus percent of UK laws,
[03:10:13.697 --> 03:10:22.107]  Horace Johnson suggests part-Kenyan Obama may have an ancestral dislike of Britain because Kenya was a British Empire holding.
[03:10:22.107 --> 03:10:27.393]  And I'll say this, it's kind of like the movie Life of Brian where they're saying, what have the Robins ever given us?
[03:10:27.393 --> 03:10:31.377]  Well, language and literature and mathematics and the aqueducts.
[03:10:31.377 --> 03:10:33.540]  Who cares about the aqueduct?
[03:10:34.380 --> 03:10:38.683]  But this modern British Empire is dehumanizing people and enslaving folks.
[03:10:38.683 --> 03:10:40.445]  I have a problem, and it had problems too.
[03:10:40.445 --> 03:10:41.525]  I'm not defending the British Empire.
[03:10:41.525 --> 03:10:43.127]  My God, we overthrew it.
[03:10:43.127 --> 03:10:49.191]  The point is, is that Kenya complaining about the British Empire is really a joke.
[03:10:49.191 --> 03:10:52.333]  Continuing, and they don't really complain, they've been asking the Brits back in.
[03:10:52.333 --> 03:10:58.138]  The Mayor of London attacked the President for endorsing the UK's position in the EU.
[03:10:58.138 --> 03:11:00.620]  He's traveling to the UK
[03:11:02.805 --> 03:11:08.430]  Obama is lobbying for them to stay inside the corrupt EU that's signing them on to all these European debts.
[03:11:08.430 --> 03:11:16.116]  This is colonialism, globalist corporate colonialism, so powerful that even the UK is going under colonialism.
[03:11:16.116 --> 03:11:18.918]  But the UK always was under colonialism.
[03:11:18.918 --> 03:11:21.901]  The Brits paid for it, did the fighting, did all of it.
[03:11:23.171 --> 03:11:28.272]  Lost millions per war sometime to build this global empire that was then handed over.
[03:11:28.272 --> 03:11:41.436]  So of course the Queen of England is all about staying in the EU with her Transylvanian husband, Prince Philip, who says black people aren't humans.
[03:11:41.436 --> 03:11:46.637]  And I'm really surprised that Prince Philip, one of the biggest racists on the planet,
[03:11:49.005 --> 03:11:50.327]  Would even hang around with Obama.
[03:11:50.327 --> 03:11:53.530]  I mean, that guy is a famously flaming racist.
[03:11:53.530 --> 03:11:57.575]  He'll literally be on live, he'll be saying, you know, all their blacks here, do they have any spears to throw?
[03:11:57.575 --> 03:12:00.218]  Oh, how do they screw a light bulb?
[03:12:00.218 --> 03:12:02.821]  You know, I mean, he, I'm not going to say the other jokes.
[03:12:02.821 --> 03:12:04.183]  He said it on TV before.
[03:12:04.183 --> 03:12:06.065]  They like, sponge it as quickly as they can.
[03:12:09.511 --> 03:12:11.091]  So that's what this is all about.
[03:12:11.091 --> 03:12:13.952]  That's what all this fake liberalism is really all about.
[03:12:13.952 --> 03:12:21.854]  Obama to make a historic Hiroshima visit at G7 Summit to apologize for what happened in World War II.
[03:12:21.854 --> 03:12:35.398]  You mean how the Japanese were told they could have areas of the Pacific and then weren't told that and then we stood down so they could attack and then they tried to unconditionally surrender for three weeks before Hiroshima and Nagasaki got A-bombs?
[03:12:35.398 --> 03:12:35.738]  What was it?
[03:12:37.242 --> 03:12:39.383]  Fat boy, little boy, what were the names of those moms?
[03:12:39.383 --> 03:12:47.467]  But it's just all political stunts that are going on.
[03:12:47.467 --> 03:12:47.607]  Now...
[03:12:49.218 --> 03:12:53.940]  Continuing here today, let's go now to the other studio.
[03:12:53.940 --> 03:12:56.081]  I'm in the War Room, he's in the Situation Room.
[03:12:56.081 --> 03:13:01.803]  Anthony Gucciardi joins us to take over the helm and run the operation.
[03:13:01.803 --> 03:13:08.765]  Anthony, I tell you, it is quite a crazy world today, but isn't it wild how, like, everything we've been talking about forever is now coming out?
[03:13:08.765 --> 03:13:16.849]  It's a very surreal moment for me, and every day gets crazier, like a singularity of anti-New World Order awakening is happening.
[03:13:16.849 --> 03:13:17.829]  Anthony, what do you think's happening?
[03:13:18.189 --> 03:13:22.733]  It's true, and you'd think it feels good, but it doesn't, because you don't want all this to be true.
[03:13:22.733 --> 03:13:24.574]  You don't want it all to be happening.
[03:13:24.574 --> 03:13:29.538]  And it's kind of like, you know, I had a really bad migraine this morning, but I wanted to come in because there's so much stuff to cover.
[03:13:29.538 --> 03:13:38.345]  And before I was coming in, I had all this news, and Biggs came up, and I said, hey, didn't you do a report on transgendered bathrooms on kids going in there and child safety?
[03:13:38.345 --> 03:13:39.807]  It's way worse than we even thought.
[03:13:39.807 --> 03:13:40.967]  Oh, I meant to play this.
[03:13:40.967 --> 03:13:42.108]  I meant to get into this.
[03:13:42.108 --> 03:13:43.329]  I'm going to play it here, actually.
[03:13:44.410 --> 03:13:46.692]  Um, you're not going to want to miss it, seriously.
[03:13:46.692 --> 03:13:48.894]  This is a good report, and he's going to come in and break it down.
[03:13:48.894 --> 03:13:49.575]  He's found out some stuff.
[03:13:49.575 --> 03:13:50.695]  I need to work on your car for you.
[03:13:50.695 --> 03:13:51.756]  What's that?
[03:13:51.756 --> 03:13:53.538]  Hey mister, how you doing here?
[03:13:53.538 --> 03:13:58.722]  Can I change the oil for you, Mr. Gucciardi?
[03:13:58.722 --> 03:13:58.962]  You know...
[03:14:00.197 --> 03:14:02.440]  I heard Obamacare is free!
[03:14:02.440 --> 03:14:06.827]  I like socialism and the dictatorship of the proletariat.
[03:14:06.827 --> 03:14:08.990]  I'm gonna have your ass thrown in prison.
[03:14:08.990 --> 03:14:10.011]  And you know what?
[03:14:10.011 --> 03:14:12.335]  If the royalty says something, it's fine.
[03:14:12.335 --> 03:14:13.677]  It's not racist.
[03:14:13.677 --> 03:14:15.439]  But if you say anything, you're bad.
[03:14:15.439 --> 03:14:16.100]  That's just the rules.
[03:14:17.025 --> 03:14:21.568]  You know, I totally forgot about that whole deal because I meant to cover political correctness and I didn't.
[03:14:21.568 --> 03:14:34.618]  You've got this former Major League Baseball player just sends out a tweet saying, man, you know, leave the bathrooms alone and then he's fired because if they can make people be fired over saying we should have men's and women's bathrooms, all speech can be banned.
[03:14:34.618 --> 03:14:35.979]  They're just setting the precedent.
[03:14:35.979 --> 03:14:37.320]  They're moving forward.
[03:14:37.320 --> 03:14:38.321]  It's completely insane.
[03:14:38.321 --> 03:14:42.244]  Meanwhile, this UFC guy won this fight and screamed, Allah Akbar, we're taking over.
[03:14:42.244 --> 03:14:42.865]  We're going to get you.
[03:14:43.510 --> 03:14:55.574]  Remember, you know, I remember watching a show like 10 years ago and you were talking about how they're gonna let men with wigs in the bathrooms and stuff and people are like, that's never gonna happen, that's insane, you know, there's child safety laws and stuff.
[03:14:55.574 --> 03:14:59.395]  No, it's actually happening and some of the stuff we're gonna talk about is... But you know what the antidote is?
[03:14:59.395 --> 03:15:03.237]  It's the super ultra red redneck Make America Free Again hats.
[03:15:03.237 --> 03:15:06.778]  Camouflage, royal red and royal blue at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:15:07.378 --> 03:15:20.886]  I mean, listen, I walk into a truck stop, or I walk into a deer camp, I mean, look, with this big car ahead, they barely make hats big enough for me, these actually fit on me, I walk in and they literally understand that Big Daddy's arrived.
[03:15:20.886 --> 03:15:21.886]  Oh, they know.
[03:15:21.886 --> 03:15:23.147]  They know that they've arrived.
[03:15:23.147 --> 03:15:27.189]  They know that they've arrived when they see that car.
[03:15:27.189 --> 03:15:28.610]  Put it on backwards, yeah!
[03:15:28.610 --> 03:15:29.631]  Look at that!
[03:15:29.631 --> 03:15:31.372]  I love this car!
[03:15:31.372 --> 03:15:32.793]  Anthony!
[03:15:32.793 --> 03:15:33.113]  Anthony!
[03:15:34.093 --> 03:15:35.296]  What's wrong with Obama?
[03:15:35.296 --> 03:15:36.559]  We ought to arrest everybody.
[03:15:36.559 --> 03:15:38.162]  Father of mothers is a bad word.
[03:15:38.162 --> 03:15:38.784]  I agree.
[03:15:38.784 --> 03:15:40.147]  Take them all to prison.
[03:15:40.147 --> 03:15:43.274]  I mean, look, men with wigs should be able to go and spy in mall bathrooms.
[03:15:43.274 --> 03:15:43.615]  It's fine.
[03:15:44.346 --> 03:15:45.386]  That's right.
[03:15:45.386 --> 03:15:51.908]  That's our real liberty, not to have the NSA spy on us or them have forced inoculations or sign us on to foreign debt.
[03:15:51.908 --> 03:15:58.409]  The real freedom, Anthony, is that, you know, six foot five guys can go in the men women's potty now.
[03:15:58.409 --> 03:16:02.550]  Did you hear they're trying to have a move to ban urinals as a form of male dominance?
[03:16:02.550 --> 03:16:04.031]  You know, I went to Washington, D.C.
[03:16:04.031 --> 03:16:06.331]  a while ago, and they only had women's bathrooms.
[03:16:06.331 --> 03:16:07.631]  There was no men's.
[03:16:07.631 --> 03:16:09.752]  So I just asked the manager, I said, is there a men's bathroom?
[03:16:09.752 --> 03:16:11.532]  They're like, yeah, it's the women's bathroom.
[03:16:11.532 --> 03:16:13.113]  If a woman's not in it, you can use it.
[03:16:16.574 --> 03:16:17.814]  We don't even get bathrooms anymore.
[03:16:17.814 --> 03:16:21.896]  We got a bunch of con artist pervs that run the private federal reserve and call it federal.
[03:16:21.896 --> 03:16:23.016]  We put up with all this.
[03:16:23.016 --> 03:16:24.237]  We kind of deserve it, Anthony.
[03:16:24.237 --> 03:16:25.157]  We put up with this much stuff.
[03:16:25.157 --> 03:16:27.058]  By the way, I really like your backwards hat character.
[03:16:27.058 --> 03:16:29.118]  We should bring that on the show permanently.
[03:16:29.118 --> 03:16:30.479]  Tell you what, why don't you interview me?
[03:16:30.859 --> 03:16:32.320]  I need a hat, too, back where it's at.
[03:16:32.320 --> 03:16:33.760]  Why don't you interview me right now?
[03:16:33.760 --> 03:16:35.081]  Okay, let's do this.
[03:16:35.081 --> 03:16:39.203]  This is a very serious 60-minute interview.
[03:16:39.203 --> 03:16:44.445]  I think racism's bad, and I think the mother and father and he and she could be hurtful.
[03:16:44.445 --> 03:16:47.527]  Why, if somebody ain't a he or she, that makes him feel bad.
[03:16:47.527 --> 03:16:51.989]  I don't think we should have any identity but what the TV says.
[03:16:51.989 --> 03:16:52.569]  No, I agree.
[03:16:52.569 --> 03:16:53.350]  Let me ask you a question.
[03:16:53.350 --> 03:16:55.070]  What do you think about brown paper bags?
[03:16:55.070 --> 03:16:55.791]  Do those offend you?
[03:16:57.012 --> 03:17:00.174]  They told me that was racist and I agree we shouldn't use it.
[03:17:00.174 --> 03:17:01.995]  I do whatever I'm told.
[03:17:01.995 --> 03:17:05.197]  I'm a social justice warrior.
[03:17:05.197 --> 03:17:08.700]  And if you don't agree, you'll be screamed at and cursed at and attacked.
[03:17:08.700 --> 03:17:09.641]  And that's how it is.
[03:17:09.641 --> 03:17:12.963]  There's no intellectual debate, you'll just be attacked.
[03:17:12.963 --> 03:17:16.726]  I've been drinking a lot of fluoride and I'm feeling pretty good right now.
[03:17:16.726 --> 03:17:21.469]  Yeah, you look like you're feeling really good.
[03:17:21.469 --> 03:17:23.310]  Sorry, I was watching MTV though.
[03:17:23.310 --> 03:17:25.232]  That's all that matters actually.
[03:17:27.099 --> 03:17:28.921]  Reality television is all that matters.
[03:17:28.921 --> 03:17:32.864]  If you're going to watch anything, at least just watch that, right?
[03:17:32.864 --> 03:17:34.225]  I think you should put double hats.
[03:17:34.225 --> 03:17:35.806]  I think you should put both on.
[03:17:35.806 --> 03:17:41.931]  This is what we really want to see here.
[03:17:41.931 --> 03:17:44.393]  Available at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:17:44.393 --> 03:17:46.095]  This is quality content right here.
[03:17:46.095 --> 03:17:48.056]  That's a good photo, actually.
[03:17:48.056 --> 03:17:50.498]  That should be your new, like, press photo right there.
[03:17:50.498 --> 03:17:52.220]  You should send that out to everyone.
[03:17:55.487 --> 03:17:58.655]  Alex Jones shows his true self, his true beliefs on air.
[03:18:03.186 --> 03:18:06.767]  He's also known as unresistible to women, even though that's an improper gender term.
[03:18:06.767 --> 03:18:08.868]  Only when you have those hats on, yes.
[03:18:08.868 --> 03:18:13.590]  Yeah, it's like, ladies, look, you think this guy's confident, okay?
[03:18:13.590 --> 03:18:17.212]  Hey, Infowarsstore.com, folks, fund the war machine.
[03:18:17.212 --> 03:18:19.132]  And look, I'm self-deprecating on purpose.
[03:18:19.132 --> 03:18:20.953]  People say, hey, you're leading a serious movement.
[03:18:20.953 --> 03:18:22.194]  Why do you joke around some?
[03:18:22.194 --> 03:18:24.895]  Because it's about having fun when we dominate the globalists.
[03:18:25.555 --> 03:18:26.836]  I mean, what a bunch of crazies.
[03:18:26.836 --> 03:18:34.645]  They've turned all these little desperate TV heads that won't have jobs, all these fake college degrees, into thinking they obsess all day over where they go pee-pee.
[03:18:34.645 --> 03:18:41.192]  And, you know, I mean, I'm here to tell you, folks, that you've been set up, you're being manipulated if you serve the system, it's time to wake up.
[03:18:41.192 --> 03:18:45.897]  And I saw the Social Justice Warrior footage we've been getting all over the country, our crew has, where I'm doing, Beggs and everybody else.
[03:18:46.457 --> 03:18:50.582]  These people literally are so stupid they're scary, Gucciardi.
[03:18:50.582 --> 03:18:56.488]  And so, I don't know what we do about them, but I tell you, we're in for a very exciting time, aren't we?
[03:18:56.488 --> 03:18:59.271]  Yeah, I'll tell you what, if you can't make jokes, you can't have fun, you're already lost.
[03:18:59.271 --> 03:19:02.374]  The political correctness, PC principle, PC police already beat you.
[03:19:02.374 --> 03:19:05.117]  If you can't sit around and have fun... You PC, bro?
[03:19:05.117 --> 03:19:06.139]  You PC, bro?
[03:19:06.139 --> 03:19:06.959]  You PC enough, bro?
[03:19:07.867 --> 03:19:09.748]  We actually could start PC frat.
[03:19:09.748 --> 03:19:12.890]  No, but if you can't make jokes and you can't have fun, we already lost, right?
[03:19:12.890 --> 03:19:13.650]  So that's the whole point.
[03:19:13.650 --> 03:19:15.031]  Everyone just has to be serious and care.
[03:19:15.031 --> 03:19:25.557]  People serving this are idiots, admittedly under a documented declassified brainwashing program, but they don't want to admit they're in a brainwashing program because they're delusional with cognitive dissonance.
[03:19:25.557 --> 03:19:27.898]  I mean, it's a fact this is going on, my friend.
[03:19:28.098 --> 03:19:32.762]  They have the power of the establishment system behind them when they act all politically correct and say you're racist.
[03:19:32.762 --> 03:19:34.464]  It's like a ton of power to them.
[03:19:34.464 --> 03:19:38.968]  Because they're so insecure, they're associating with the black wings they're under.
[03:19:38.968 --> 03:19:41.471]  I'm going to come back with Sammy Hangar.
[03:19:41.471 --> 03:19:45.474]  There's only one way to rock because this is a fact and you know it's true.
[03:19:45.474 --> 03:19:49.198]  Anthony Gucciardi, straight ahead out of the bullpen, straight ahead.
[03:19:49.198 --> 03:19:50.379]  You know his nickname is BJ.
[03:19:50.379 --> 03:19:52.180]  We'll be back.

[03:20:01.814 --> 03:20:03.475]  I'm Don from New Mexico.
[03:20:03.475 --> 03:20:05.957]  January of 2000, I had a heart attack.
[03:20:05.957 --> 03:20:08.399]  Then my real health began going downhill.
[03:20:08.399 --> 03:20:11.141]  I had high blood pressure, diabetes, poor vision.
[03:20:11.141 --> 03:20:12.341]  I wasn't sleeping well.
[03:20:12.341 --> 03:20:13.242]  I was a mess.
[03:20:13.242 --> 03:20:15.924]  Don reports dramatic improvements with heart and body extract.
[03:20:16.084 --> 03:20:18.886]  I started taking Heart and Body Extract from within a few days.
[03:20:18.886 --> 03:20:20.186]  I started sleeping better.
[03:20:20.186 --> 03:20:22.088]  My blood pressure normalized.
[03:20:22.088 --> 03:20:23.649]  My diabetes normalized.
[03:20:23.649 --> 03:20:24.829]  My sleep improved.

[03:22:59.838 --> 03:23:06.941]  Father President Ronald Reagan believes so strongly in gold that in 1985 he hated gold ownership forever.
[03:23:06.941 --> 03:23:12.703]  Today, our national debt is spiraling out of control, but gold coins could be the answer.

[03:23:27.649 --> 03:23:31.251]  A good stove is at the top of the list for any serious survivalist.

[03:24:11.721 --> 03:24:17.164]  These are interesting times to be alive, but hey, at least you're alive at a very, very exciting point in history.
[03:24:17.164 --> 03:24:24.168]  Even though some of it is horrible and insane, at the same time, it's a very exciting, pivotal point in history, and you get to be a part of it.
[03:24:24.168 --> 03:24:26.149]  So, look.
[03:24:26.149 --> 03:24:32.112]  Joe Biggs is going to come in next segment and talk about his report on transgendered bathrooms.
[03:24:32.112 --> 03:24:35.174]  And here's the whole point about what's going on with that.
[03:24:35.934 --> 03:24:44.959]  So the law is changing now where anyone that identifies as a female, as far as Target goes, but they're pushing it in other states and counties, etc.
[03:24:44.959 --> 03:24:46.560]  But Target is making a corporate decision.
[03:24:46.560 --> 03:24:52.103]  Anyone that identifies as a female or identifies as a male can go into that gender-specific bathroom.
[03:24:52.103 --> 03:25:01.948]  So let's say, you know, a man dressed as a woman, or not even, just I guess I could go into a female bathroom if I identified as a female without making any aesthetic changes to my character.
[03:25:01.948 --> 03:25:03.609]  I could just kind of go in and say, well, I'm a female.
[03:25:04.309 --> 03:25:09.351]  So what we're going to talk about is, number one, I'm not against transgendered people.
[03:25:09.351 --> 03:25:14.153]  If that's what you want to do with your life, you are a free human being with free thought and free action.
[03:25:14.153 --> 03:25:16.014]  You can do whatever you want with your body.
[03:25:16.014 --> 03:25:17.094]  You can do anything, truly.
[03:25:17.094 --> 03:25:18.935]  It does not bother me one bit.
[03:25:18.935 --> 03:25:25.037]  I have acquaintances who are of all different types, and I don't care, and I'm not judging you.
[03:25:25.037 --> 03:25:26.758]  But what I do care about is stuff like this.
[03:25:27.418 --> 03:25:32.001]  Man dressed as woman arrested for spying into mall bathroom stall.
[03:25:32.001 --> 03:25:38.966]  So this guy dressed as a woman and goes into the mall bathroom, so I'm a woman, and starts spying on girls.
[03:25:38.966 --> 03:25:45.831]  Man dressed as a woman was arrested in Virginia after a police say he was caught peeping into a restroom, and man accused of peeping into restrooms happened over and over again.
[03:25:45.831 --> 03:25:46.632]  We've got a bunch of stories.
[03:25:46.632 --> 03:25:51.455]  Joe Biggs is going to come in with his report as well about all these people that are dressing up and peeping and stuff.
[03:25:52.296 --> 03:26:00.762]  It's not about the transgender people, it's about the ridiculous language of these rulings, these laws, these policies, that anyone can just go into any bathroom and do whatever they want.
[03:26:00.762 --> 03:26:02.303]  So we're going to talk about that.
[03:26:02.303 --> 03:26:06.586]  We're also going to play this report here, I believe we still have time, because this article came out.
[03:26:06.586 --> 03:26:09.508]  Decriminalize all drugs, business and world leaders tell the UN.
[03:26:09.508 --> 03:26:15.732]  We've got billionaires, former presidents, and AIDS researchers saying it's time to decriminalize drugs.
[03:26:15.732 --> 03:26:19.895]  And it reminds me of this report, Señor Thorik smashes cartels, an interesting one by Jakari Jackson.
[03:26:19.895 --> 03:26:20.415]  Let's go ahead and play it.
[03:26:20.865 --> 03:26:29.368]  When you talk about violence in Mexico, you often think of names like El Chapo, places like Sinaloa, but now there are new areas and players involved.
[03:26:29.368 --> 03:26:33.910]  The person I'm going to be talking about today is not even a drug cartel kingpin at all.
[03:26:33.910 --> 03:26:37.352]  He is a vigilante out there combating the cartels.
[03:26:37.352 --> 03:26:39.613]  He goes by the name of Senior Thor.
[03:26:40.473 --> 03:26:46.276]  And when he catches his prey, he makes them dress in women's clothing to dehumanize them, demoralize them.
[03:26:46.276 --> 03:26:49.458]  In some cases, he makes them engage with one another.
[03:26:49.458 --> 03:26:53.920]  During one raid, he stole the ashes of a feared drug lord's deceased father.
[03:26:53.920 --> 03:26:56.301]  That's pretty, uh, gutsy.
[03:26:56.301 --> 03:26:58.102]  His nemesis, known as El Chive,
[03:26:58.582 --> 03:27:05.184]  Responded by accusing him of corruption, which I think is rather laughable for a drug kingpin to accuse anybody of corruption.
[03:27:05.184 --> 03:27:07.744]  But I guess that's his story and he's sticking to it.
[03:27:07.744 --> 03:27:11.886]  They're saying that El Thor is allegedly stealing money from the cartels.
[03:27:11.886 --> 03:27:16.747]  But I'm saying if you steal money from a thief, is it really stealing in the first place?
[03:27:16.747 --> 03:27:20.708]  But I guess everybody has their own moral sanctions to go by.
[03:27:20.708 --> 03:27:24.729]  And they're saying that Senior Thor is a former Marine, retired Marine.
[03:27:25.149 --> 03:27:41.637]  He's in Mexico trying to clean up the streets because he sees the problems that are lying in law enforcement, and I am sure there are good people in law enforcement out there who want to get rid of the cartels, but you have more than a few who are actually working for the cartels, so he's just cutting through the middleman and going after the guys himself.
[03:27:41.637 --> 03:27:46.440]  Very similar to a character like the Punisher, in my point of view.
[03:27:46.440 --> 03:27:47.620]  He's been pretty effective.
[03:27:47.620 --> 03:27:52.323]  He's knocked down some big hitters out there, but he still has a lot more to go.
[03:27:53.385 --> 03:27:56.567]  And one of the groups that he's affecting is Los Zetas.
[03:27:56.567 --> 03:27:59.649]  If you guys recall, we've been talking about Los Zetas for some time.
[03:27:59.649 --> 03:28:10.156]  I actually have an article here, Paul Joseph Watson, dated back in 2011 when we saw that a Los Zetas kingpin was saying that they bought guns directly from the United States government.
[03:28:10.156 --> 03:28:12.317]  Now I'm sure many people will dismiss this.
[03:28:12.317 --> 03:28:15.139]  They say, well he's a kingpin, we can't trust anything he says.
[03:28:15.899 --> 03:28:21.947]  We do know the ATF did give guns to Mexican drug cartels, so at least hear what the guy has to say.
[03:28:21.947 --> 03:28:31.460]  Now, whether or not it was directly related to Operation Fast and Furious, I can believe that they were sold weapons by the United States government, because you think about
[03:28:32.741 --> 03:28:37.605]  The Iran-Contra scandal, selling guns to people overseas, and on and on and on.
[03:28:37.605 --> 03:28:43.910]  Selling guns to our enemies or just bad people in general is not something new for the United States government.
[03:28:43.910 --> 03:28:44.810]  They do it all the time.
[03:28:44.810 --> 03:28:46.291]  They've done it throughout history.
[03:28:46.291 --> 03:28:49.414]  Multiple presidents, administrations, right...
[03:28:50.094 --> 03:28:52.757]  Left, whatever, they go about this.
[03:28:52.757 --> 03:29:03.308]  This reminds me of films like Sicario, documentaries like Cartel Land, where the people in Mexico actually take it upon themselves to fight back, and some people say they're vigilantes, they're dangerous.
[03:29:03.308 --> 03:29:06.652]  Regardless, even if that is true, you have to take into account
[03:29:06.972 --> 03:29:12.115]  The fact that what's being done in Mexico is not doing enough to stop the problem there.
[03:29:12.115 --> 03:29:18.038]  You see routinely, just like you saw in the movie Sicario, they were killing people, hanging them from the rafters under bridges.
[03:29:18.038 --> 03:29:19.379]  They do that in real life.
[03:29:19.379 --> 03:29:21.800]  Oftentimes, those victims are journalists.
[03:29:21.800 --> 03:29:29.225]  We've seen multiple reports about good politicians who want to root out the cartels, ending up dead, people on payrolls, as I already mentioned.
[03:29:29.225 --> 03:29:32.126]  So it is a very big and steady problem out there.
[03:29:32.126 --> 03:29:33.247]  So something has to be done.
[03:29:33.587 --> 03:29:37.230]  Good, bad or indifferent, he is making enough change to get his name out there.
[03:29:37.230 --> 03:29:42.015]  So, Senior Thor, we'll see how you continue and possibly you'll have a long career.
[03:29:42.015 --> 03:29:48.000]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[03:29:48.000 --> 03:29:49.401]  We're on the march.
[03:29:49.401 --> 03:29:51.923]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:51.923 --> 03:29:54.626]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:58.979 --> 03:30:03.403]  Is the British government more worried about transgender bathrooms than ISIS?
[03:30:03.403 --> 03:30:10.750]  This week it emerged that ISIS was plotting to attack tourist beaches across Europe by posing as vendors and placing bombs under sunbeds.
[03:30:10.750 --> 03:30:17.897]  Meanwhile in North Carolina, people are being required by a new law to use public bathrooms that correspond with their biological gender.
[03:30:18.137 --> 03:30:24.783]  So, which grave threat to the Brits traveling overseas did the British Foreign Office decide to warn its citizens about?
[03:30:24.783 --> 03:30:33.230]  That's right, they wanted travelers to be aware of the controversial new bathroom laws in North Carolina and Mississippi before visiting the U.S.
[03:30:33.570 --> 03:30:39.715]  Thirty British citizens were slaughtered on a beach by ISIS jihadists in Tunisia less than a year ago.
[03:30:39.715 --> 03:30:43.919]  ISIS frequently calls for the execution of members of the LGBT community.
[03:30:43.919 --> 03:30:50.465]  The Foreign Office issues a warning about bathroom laws, yet ignores the terror threat to attack tourist beaches.
[03:30:50.465 --> 03:30:54.168]  For more on the absurdity, visit InfoWars.com right now.

[03:32:01.615 --> 03:32:03.556]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[03:32:03.556 --> 03:32:07.639]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[03:32:07.639 --> 03:32:10.201]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[03:32:10.201 --> 03:32:12.623]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.

[03:32:35.526 --> 03:32:38.107]  Concentrated or maximum potency.
[03:32:38.107 --> 03:32:50.094]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while But then burn you out in my experience where stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source So it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[03:32:50.094 --> 03:32:57.058]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWarsLife
[03:33:00.145 --> 03:33:08.312]  They took my saddle in Houston, broke my leg in Santa Fe.
[03:33:08.312 --> 03:33:14.397]  Lost my wife and a girlfriend somewhere along the way.
[03:33:14.397 --> 03:33:17.419]  In defense of human liberty, Alex Jones.
[03:33:19.934 --> 03:33:21.916]  All right, it's the fourth hour.
[03:33:21.916 --> 03:33:22.877]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi.
[03:33:22.877 --> 03:33:24.298]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:24.298 --> 03:33:29.001]  I'm here with Joe Biggs, and we've got some interesting things to talk about here.
[03:33:29.001 --> 03:33:42.112]  Now, first and foremost, the reason I played that Jakari video on the drug war is to highlight how insane the drug war is, and because of this super popular story that's been going around, where decriminalize all drugs, business and world leaders tell UN.
[03:33:42.112 --> 03:33:48.076]  Richard Branson, who I'm sure you know about, the billionaire, and three ex-presidents say, hey, the drug war,
[03:33:48.917 --> 03:33:49.778]  Has been lost.
[03:33:49.778 --> 03:33:51.300]  The policy is totally flawed.
[03:33:51.300 --> 03:33:52.402]  It's a dead game.
[03:33:52.402 --> 03:33:53.764]  So that's why I played that video.
[03:33:53.764 --> 03:33:55.906]  Very interesting, crazy things going on.
[03:33:55.906 --> 03:34:03.576]  Now let's talk about the almighty political correctness, craziness, transgendered bathroom saga with Biggs.
[03:34:04.938 --> 03:34:07.460]  Okay, bring everyone up to speed here in a second.
[03:34:07.460 --> 03:34:10.303]  But basically, stores are now changing their policies.
[03:34:10.303 --> 03:34:21.294]  Some cities have enacted, as far as I understand, legislation where men or women who identify as the opposite gender can just go into bathrooms, and it's causing some bad things to happen.
[03:34:21.294 --> 03:34:25.037]  Like, a California man dressed as a woman busted for videoing in a ladies bathroom.
[03:34:25.037 --> 03:34:26.839]  There's multiple, you gave me just a small stack.
[03:34:27.199 --> 03:34:34.203]  Man accused of peeping in women's bathroom, faces child porn charges, man dressed as woman arrested for spying into mall bathroom stalls.
[03:34:34.203 --> 03:34:43.069]  So everything that everyone said, hey, maybe this isn't the best idea to let people put on a wig and go into the opposite person's bathroom and look at little kids and stuff, seems to be happening.
[03:34:43.069 --> 03:34:43.829]  Give us an update on this.
[03:34:43.829 --> 03:34:44.470]  I mean, here's the thing.
[03:34:47.384 --> 03:34:51.587]  Not a law now to where men have to go into men's room, women have to go into women's room.
[03:34:51.587 --> 03:34:57.670]  When you see something like that, it's easier to spot and go, hey, this guy's a peepin' tom, this guy's a perv, this guy's a pedophile.
[03:34:57.670 --> 03:34:58.291]  Get him out of there.
[03:34:58.291 --> 03:35:06.456]  Once you make this a law nationwide and all these businesses change their policies like Target did on the 19th, now you don't know who's there.
[03:35:07.216 --> 03:35:20.267]  Like, because if you say something, you're homophobic, you're transphobic, you're one of these phobics, and you see a guy come in with a wig on and you have to go, well, you know, that's, it's 2016, you know, times have got to change, you know, that's ridiculous.
[03:35:20.267 --> 03:35:23.610]  I want to know who the predators are, because there are predators in this country.
[03:35:23.610 --> 03:35:30.917]  It doesn't mean that a transgendered person is a bad person, but there are going to be bad people who use these loopholes to go in and do harm.
[03:35:31.377 --> 03:35:33.198]  Like the articles are being shown right now.
[03:35:33.198 --> 03:35:37.159]  These kind of people exist out there and that's where the biggest threat lies.
[03:35:37.159 --> 03:35:43.921]  Because we have children who are going into these bathroom stalls alone and we went to Target yesterday and we actually talked to people about that.
[03:35:43.921 --> 03:35:46.762]  So if we can, if you guys have that video... Yeah, let's go ahead and play that video.
[03:35:46.762 --> 03:35:49.363]  Gender Identity Policy Threatens Children's Safety by Bigs.
[03:35:49.363 --> 03:35:50.303]  Let's go ahead and play that video.
[03:35:51.667 --> 03:35:53.808]  This is Joe Biggs with Infowars.com.
[03:35:53.808 --> 03:35:58.370]  Now we're standing outside of a Target location in Austin, Texas.
[03:35:58.370 --> 03:36:11.875]  Now yesterday, Target's corporate website released a statement saying that they want to welcome transgendered people, men, women who identify as a separate gender, a different gender, to be able to use those restrooms and changing rooms.
[03:36:11.875 --> 03:36:17.317]  So we came out here today to find out if people think that there's an issue with that or if they're completely fine with it.
[03:36:17.577 --> 03:36:24.483]  Because we do know that there are pervers, there are pedophiles, who will take advantage of this and try to do harm to others.
[03:36:24.483 --> 03:36:26.624]  Let's go out here and find out what these people have to say.
[03:36:26.624 --> 03:36:30.488]  I don't know, I guess it's kind of a safety issue when it comes to kids, right?
[03:36:30.488 --> 03:36:33.370]  Oh, that's... Wow.
[03:36:33.370 --> 03:36:35.892]  I'm speechless.
[03:36:35.892 --> 03:36:36.392]  Wow.
[03:36:36.392 --> 03:36:37.894]  The no was a policy.
[03:36:37.894 --> 03:36:40.696]  Yep, it just came out yesterday at their Target corporate website.
[03:36:42.205 --> 03:36:47.629]  I mean, I'm all for everybody being who they are, and that's fine, but I don't think it's a good idea.
[03:36:47.629 --> 03:36:48.990]  No, that's crazy.
[03:36:48.990 --> 03:36:50.591]  I mean, that doesn't make any sense.
[03:36:50.591 --> 03:36:51.332]  Wait, say that again?
[03:36:51.332 --> 03:36:54.274]  I mean, that seems so illogical.
[03:36:54.274 --> 03:36:56.596]  I support Target and their policy.
[03:36:56.596 --> 03:36:59.238]  I don't know, I haven't thought about it.
[03:36:59.238 --> 03:37:03.841]  Do you think anything could possibly go wrong with it, or do you think it's fine that men can go to the women's restroom?
[03:37:03.841 --> 03:37:05.042]  I haven't thought about it.
[03:37:05.042 --> 03:37:08.344]  No issue, no comment, idea?
[03:37:08.344 --> 03:37:09.285]  Yeah.
[03:37:09.285 --> 03:37:10.306]  I have no problem with that at all.
[03:37:10.643 --> 03:37:11.063]  No?
[03:37:11.063 --> 03:37:11.423]  No.
[03:37:11.423 --> 03:37:12.623]  No problems.
[03:37:12.623 --> 03:37:13.964]  Check the calendar.
[03:37:13.964 --> 03:37:14.744]  Check the calendar.
[03:37:14.744 --> 03:37:14.964]  It's 2016.
[03:37:14.964 --> 03:37:16.384]  It's time for a change.
[03:37:16.384 --> 03:37:23.666]  I have a mummy and daddy, an adopted mummy and daddy, who are totally comfortable with me being a little girl.
[03:37:23.666 --> 03:37:32.648]  You know, when you see a guy that's 300 pounds with a goatee who pulls in in a Harley and is going through my closet saying, can I wear this dress?
[03:37:32.648 --> 03:37:33.348]  Can I wear that dress?
[03:37:33.348 --> 03:37:35.949]  You know, or can I kiss you when I'm wearing the dress?
[03:37:35.949 --> 03:37:36.609]  You don't expect it.
[03:37:37.766 --> 03:37:45.311]  Um, well I have some friends and people that I know that would probably identify that way, so I'm okay with whatever suits their needs.
[03:37:45.311 --> 03:37:48.072]  I don't know, and I'm a pretty liberal old lady.
[03:37:48.072 --> 03:37:52.875]  I'm just not real sure that I want men in a dress in my bathroom space.
[03:37:52.875 --> 03:38:01.260]  But on the other hand, I think if you have gender identification other than what you were born, you have rights too.
[03:38:01.260 --> 03:38:03.381]  So it's a tough way to call it.
[03:38:03.381 --> 03:38:05.322]  I think they're perverted and they ought to go to hell.
[03:38:05.322 --> 03:38:06.083]  Yeah?
[03:38:07.534 --> 03:38:09.855]  He had all targets across the country.
[03:38:09.855 --> 03:38:10.575]  I'm curious.
[03:38:10.575 --> 03:38:11.815]  I'm gonna go ask him.
[03:38:11.815 --> 03:38:12.196]  Yeah, go ask him.
[03:38:12.196 --> 03:38:14.476]  It's on the corporate website, too.
[03:38:14.476 --> 03:38:14.876]  It is.
[03:38:14.876 --> 03:38:16.137]  Yep.
[03:38:16.137 --> 03:38:28.301]  If you go to the corporate website, they updated it yesterday that allows transgendered or any kind of man who says, I identify as a woman, so me right now, a 250-pound guy, could walk in there and go, I'm a woman, and just go use the restroom.
[03:38:29.563 --> 03:38:30.963]  I don't want to ask about that.
[03:38:30.963 --> 03:38:32.044]  We'll be back.
[03:38:32.044 --> 03:38:32.264]  Thanks.
[03:38:32.264 --> 03:38:33.044]  All right.
[03:38:33.044 --> 03:38:33.944]  What do you think could go wrong?
[03:38:33.944 --> 03:38:36.665]  Like a pedophile, someone trying to misuse that to come in there and do something?
[03:38:36.665 --> 03:38:39.446]  It's a lot of crazy people in this world.
[03:38:39.446 --> 03:38:39.966]  Who knows?
[03:38:39.966 --> 03:38:41.086]  I just don't think it's a good idea.
[03:38:41.086 --> 03:38:45.707]  Especially if you have young children going to the bathroom with, you know, that.
[03:38:45.707 --> 03:38:47.468]  So, no, I don't think it's a good idea.
[03:38:47.468 --> 03:38:49.188]  I don't like that at all.
[03:38:49.188 --> 03:38:49.448]  Why?
[03:38:49.448 --> 03:38:50.709]  I mean, what could possibly go wrong?
[03:38:50.709 --> 03:38:52.189]  What don't you like about that?
[03:38:52.611 --> 03:38:55.856]  What, men going in the women's room?
[03:38:55.856 --> 03:38:57.819]  I just believe they should be separate.
[03:38:57.819 --> 03:38:58.280]  Lots of things.
[03:38:58.280 --> 03:38:58.961]  You just said it.
[03:38:58.961 --> 03:39:03.208]  It could be a pedophile who just walks in and just uses that loophole to actually...
[03:39:04.605 --> 03:39:07.227]  It's the first time I've heard that.
[03:39:07.227 --> 03:39:10.910]  It's transgender people are what the concern is.
[03:39:10.910 --> 03:39:12.471]  They're not pedophiles, they're just people.
[03:39:12.471 --> 03:39:18.656]  Well, no, no, we're not concerned about transgender, because we know there's normal people out there, but there's still bad people in this world that could use that loophole.
[03:39:18.656 --> 03:39:19.696]  I don't find that it's a loophole.
[03:39:19.696 --> 03:39:20.757]  I have two daughters.
[03:39:20.757 --> 03:39:21.258]  I don't think so.
[03:39:21.258 --> 03:39:22.819]  And you're fine with them going in?
[03:39:22.819 --> 03:39:31.946]  I don't trust anyone else to protect my child like I will, so even nowadays, if I don't feel comfortable going into the public restroom, I just go into their family restroom with my kid.
[03:39:32.686 --> 03:39:33.746]  That's what I do.
[03:39:33.746 --> 03:39:36.527]  I think trans people are just trying to use a restroom, and that's all they're doing.
[03:39:36.527 --> 03:39:40.848]  So I'm glad that Target's allowing that to happen.
[03:39:40.848 --> 03:39:43.929]  If it were that safe, I would say sure, but the world's not that safe.
[03:39:43.929 --> 03:39:50.950]  My sister had somebody use a camera to look up her skirt inside the store, so now they're in restrooms too.
[03:39:50.950 --> 03:39:59.652]  And not saying that who, I mean, that person was probably a gender straight person, you know, normally sociable, identifiable, but people still, that's somewhere supposed to be safe.
[03:40:00.276 --> 03:40:02.437]  No, I wouldn't agree with it.
[03:40:02.437 --> 03:40:04.379]  I don't want men in the women's restroom.
[03:40:20.168 --> 03:40:21.029]  I'd like to know.
[03:40:21.029 --> 03:40:26.715]  You guys have at least brought it up, and I'm curious to know if that's their policy or not.
[03:40:26.715 --> 03:40:31.800]  Then I can make my decision on whether I'm comfortable using the restroom in a Target store.
[03:40:31.800 --> 03:40:33.001]  You know what I'm tired of?
[03:40:33.001 --> 03:40:34.102]  I'm tired of delusion.
[03:40:34.102 --> 03:40:40.829]  I'm tired of people saying, everything's fine, nothing could possibly go wrong, everything's great, as long as we follow political correctness and
[03:40:41.630 --> 03:40:43.131]  Just everything is fine.
[03:40:43.131 --> 03:40:52.739]  There's nothing wrong with a 250 pound military veteran going into the bathroom with my daughters who are 13, 14, 15, 16, 8, 5 years old.
[03:40:52.739 --> 03:40:57.142]  Even though, you know, it's happening and people are putting wigs on and spying on the women and stuff.
[03:40:57.142 --> 03:40:58.583]  That's called delusional.
[03:40:58.583 --> 03:41:05.168]  It's not called taking a side on the transgendered issue because, as we're about to explain, we don't care about the transgendered issue.
[03:41:05.168 --> 03:41:06.229]  That's not our issue.
[03:41:06.229 --> 03:41:08.050]  Do whatever you want with your body, at least for me.
[03:41:08.050 --> 03:41:09.371]  Pierce yourself, do anything you want.
[03:41:09.371 --> 03:41:10.592]  I don't care.
[03:41:10.592 --> 03:41:10.853]  But,
[03:41:11.991 --> 03:41:23.497]  Let's not abandon all reason, because if the transgender PC thing wasn't involved, no one would want a 250 pound man in the bathroom with their daughters or with other females.
[03:41:23.497 --> 03:41:28.740]  I mean, it's just total insanity, but we can't admit it because it wouldn't be PC bro.
[03:41:29.724 --> 03:41:33.850]  I mean, yeah, are we willing to sacrifice safety over political correctness?
[03:41:33.850 --> 03:41:40.800]  You know, there's .03% of Americans that are transgendered, and we have to change all these laws to cater to them.
[03:41:40.800 --> 03:41:42.342]  That's narcissistic!
[03:41:42.342 --> 03:41:43.304]  I'm sorry, guess what?
[03:41:43.304 --> 03:41:46.128]  You go into a Target, there's a men's room, there's a women's room,
[03:41:46.448 --> 03:41:51.991]  Nine times out of ten, there's a family stall, and that's just one stall in there that you can go into and use.
[03:41:51.991 --> 03:42:01.076]  The guy who's trying to battle the law in North Carolina, the guy who's trying to push forward this whole transgendered restroom thing, is a sex offender!
[03:42:01.076 --> 03:42:13.202]  The guy who's pushing it, and the reason all these artists across the country are going, I'm not going to go play in North Carolina, I'm canceling my concert, because a guy who's a sex offender who wants to allow men, dressed as women, to go into women's restrooms.
[03:42:13.202 --> 03:42:15.263]  I'm sorry, I have a huge deal with that.
[03:42:15.603 --> 03:42:16.644]  That is ridiculous!
[03:42:16.644 --> 03:42:18.165]  You know what's so funny?
[03:42:18.165 --> 03:42:22.388]  You don't even have to be for or against it, but you can at least have political discussion, intellectual discussion.
[03:42:22.388 --> 03:42:27.412]  It's like when you were in New York asking those people, you know, why they thought, you know, such and such was racist or whatever.
[03:42:27.412 --> 03:42:28.312]  F you!
[03:42:28.312 --> 03:42:29.193]  Screw you!
[03:42:29.193 --> 03:42:30.094]  You're an idiot!
[03:42:30.094 --> 03:42:30.854]  It's the same thing.
[03:42:30.854 --> 03:42:32.615]  It's like we can't even talk about it.
[03:42:32.615 --> 03:42:32.976]  You know why?
[03:42:32.976 --> 03:42:34.757]  It's called intellectual domination.
[03:42:34.757 --> 03:42:36.078]  That's what political correctness is.
[03:42:36.078 --> 03:42:37.819]  It's verbal and intellectual domination.
[03:42:37.819 --> 03:42:42.883]  And when you go outside the established little mind bubble you're allowed to think within,
[03:42:43.283 --> 03:42:43.863]  You get attacked.
[03:42:43.863 --> 03:42:48.605]  You're not allowed to even talk about maybe we shouldn't let men into other, you know, women's bathrooms.
[03:42:48.605 --> 03:42:51.486]  Maybe it's actually, you know, something we should talk about.
[03:42:51.486 --> 03:42:52.187]  No!
[03:42:52.187 --> 03:42:52.667]  No!
[03:42:52.667 --> 03:42:52.967]  No!
[03:42:52.967 --> 03:42:53.787]  You're racist.
[03:42:53.787 --> 03:42:54.628]  Everything's racist.
[03:42:54.628 --> 03:42:55.588]  Everything's sexist.
[03:42:55.588 --> 03:42:57.069]  Everything's homophobic.
[03:42:57.069 --> 03:42:58.449]  And no discussion is allowed.
[03:42:58.449 --> 03:43:02.511]  That's a verbal and intellectual domination that is invisible.
[03:43:02.511 --> 03:43:03.211]  And guess what?
[03:43:03.211 --> 03:43:04.912]  We are allowing it to happen.
[03:43:04.912 --> 03:43:06.953]  You have to choose to let that into your life.
[03:43:06.953 --> 03:43:09.214]  All these people that you ask and you say, you don't have a problem with that?
[03:43:09.214 --> 03:43:09.494]  No.
[03:43:09.494 --> 03:43:10.154]  Everything's fine.
[03:43:10.154 --> 03:43:11.034]  Everything's great.
[03:43:11.034 --> 03:43:12.455]  Do you really think they believe that?
[03:43:13.055 --> 03:43:30.884]  No, you can look at the polls and people will say one thing on air or on television because they don't want to be ostracized by their social circles and the establishment and stuff, but then secretly, just like many big names I know, say things on air and then they come back, you know, like musicians and stuff and then be like, by the way, I really like Trump.
[03:43:31.144 --> 03:43:32.686]  And I'm not even saying Trump is great.
[03:43:32.686 --> 03:43:35.429]  I'm just saying they don't want to get ostracized.
[03:43:35.429 --> 03:43:36.631]  So people have been conditioned.
[03:43:36.631 --> 03:43:39.594]  It's an invisible conditioning that we've all been bought into.
[03:43:39.594 --> 03:43:41.437]  You don't even have to take a side, which is the best part.
[03:43:41.437 --> 03:43:48.125]  You just, for me, it's all about just discussing it and being able to talk about it because I'm not going to let the invisible control dominate me.
[03:43:48.285 --> 03:43:51.767]  Well people always think they're going to go out today and they know something bad is going to happen.
[03:43:51.767 --> 03:43:59.991]  Like the people who went to the Bataclan Theater in Paris knew that something bad was going to happen and they chose just to have a hope in humanity that day that maybe those bad guys wouldn't do it.
[03:43:59.991 --> 03:44:01.131]  No, guess what?
[03:44:01.131 --> 03:44:03.972]  Everything's fine and then all of a sudden things can go bad really quick.
[03:44:03.972 --> 03:44:11.256]  You could be walking into your bathroom, pull your pants down and sit there and use the bathroom and then some dude walks in banging on the door with a camera coming around.
[03:44:11.696 --> 03:44:13.037]  There are crazy people.
[03:44:13.037 --> 03:44:14.878]  You don't know what's going to happen in this world.
[03:44:14.878 --> 03:44:15.818]  Evil exists.
[03:44:15.818 --> 03:44:16.979]  Bad people are there.
[03:44:16.979 --> 03:44:20.381]  And you can't be naive to that whole aspect.
[03:44:20.381 --> 03:44:22.122]  We do live in a world that is bad.
[03:44:22.122 --> 03:44:23.423]  This is not a perfect world.
[03:44:23.423 --> 03:44:27.545]  Like Bernie Sanders wants to tell you that there's rainbows and unicorns and everything's going to be happy.
[03:44:27.545 --> 03:44:29.627]  We're all going to hug and have a great time.
[03:44:29.627 --> 03:44:30.707]  That'd be great if it were.
[03:44:30.707 --> 03:44:31.608]  But that's not real.
[03:44:32.128 --> 03:44:35.891]  You know, I'm a realist, and I know that, yeah, you want to be transgender?
[03:44:35.891 --> 03:44:36.652]  Good for you!
[03:44:36.652 --> 03:44:37.352]  Awesome!
[03:44:37.352 --> 03:44:37.953]  That's great!
[03:44:37.953 --> 03:44:39.534]  More power to you, brother!
[03:44:39.534 --> 03:44:47.260]  But I am not going to sacrifice safety over me sitting there and biting my tongue and not saying the right thing, because guess what?
[03:44:47.260 --> 03:44:48.081]  Bad people are out there.
[03:44:48.081 --> 03:44:49.862]  You'd be forced to not even talk about it.
[03:44:49.862 --> 03:44:50.322]  Right?
[03:44:50.322 --> 03:44:52.564]  It's not even that we're even talking about the legislation.
[03:44:52.564 --> 03:44:53.265]  We can't even talk.
[03:44:53.988 --> 03:45:05.881]  Alright, we can't even talk about it, and it's a comfort bias, it's a normalcy bias, where people are sheltered in their life, they grow up in a little community and they never go outside the community, nothing bad ever happens, their family is just all close-knit.
[03:45:05.881 --> 03:45:14.510]  Do you realize, you know, some of these people, most of the audience obviously gets this, but there are just so many crazy people out there.
[03:45:14.990 --> 03:45:16.952]  I mean, so many crazy people.
[03:45:16.952 --> 03:45:19.373]  Growing up in Philadelphia, I saw some truly crazy people.
[03:45:19.373 --> 03:45:21.315]  I see truly crazy people every day.
[03:45:21.315 --> 03:45:25.198]  There are people that will slit your throat and kill you and rip your guts out and eat them.
[03:45:25.198 --> 03:45:27.880]  And then go take a nap and not think twice about it.
[03:45:27.880 --> 03:45:30.642]  Completely sociopathic, psychopathic, crazy people.
[03:45:30.642 --> 03:45:32.523]  And then we just say, well, everything's fine.
[03:45:32.523 --> 03:45:36.766]  And that's what makes me the most upset when you interview those people and they say, there's nothing that's going to happen.
[03:45:36.766 --> 03:45:37.767]  Everything's totally fine.
[03:45:38.027 --> 03:45:48.673]  They're living in La La Land, a self-induced intellectual coma, where they don't have to think for themselves, so that everything is just so comfortable and cozy, and nothing's ever going to be wrong.
[03:45:48.673 --> 03:46:01.100]  And until we destroy that, which by the way, political correctness just caresses that, it's like a little baby, go to sleep, everything's fine, everything's okay, everything's great, the establishment loves you, until we get past that.
[03:46:01.100 --> 03:46:03.881]  Until we get past that, though, I don't see things changing.
[03:46:03.881 --> 03:46:04.942]  And that's the most important part.
[03:46:05.622 --> 03:46:12.004]  Yeah, like you said, there's just too many people out there, out in the open, who will say one thing and then go home on the computer and click.
[03:46:12.004 --> 03:46:12.925]  I'm against that.
[03:46:12.925 --> 03:46:17.466]  But when the camera's on them, they're going to sit there and go, well, I think it's really nice and I think it's so progressive.
[03:46:17.466 --> 03:46:19.487]  Sure, sure, that's social signaling.
[03:46:19.487 --> 03:46:23.248]  Hey guys, I'm on the cell phone, driving down the highway, let's send you guys a love message.
[03:46:23.248 --> 03:46:25.689]  I just wanted to add something here, let's strike at the root of this.
[03:46:26.781 --> 03:46:27.901]  We're all inclusive.
[03:46:27.901 --> 03:46:29.682]  The West is inclusive.
[03:46:29.682 --> 03:46:38.983]  England's doing tribal advisories to North Carolina and Louisiana, but tells people to go to Muslim countries where they'll chop your head off if you're, quote, gay.
[03:46:38.983 --> 03:46:43.844]  But see, I use the word homosexual, and I'm not even against those people, because they're telling me to use the word gay.
[03:46:43.844 --> 03:46:45.084]  They want to control language.
[03:46:45.084 --> 03:46:47.185]  It's all about cultural domination.
[03:46:47.185 --> 03:46:53.426]  So the UK says don't come to the US because you might be attacked or something, because you can't have your own special body.
[03:46:54.082 --> 03:46:56.603]  This is the mental illness of Arrested Development.
[03:46:56.603 --> 03:47:03.184]  They've lowered it down to potty training, where all of our rights are being taken, but you can go pee-pee where you want.
[03:47:03.184 --> 03:47:04.264]  This is what's happening.
[03:47:04.264 --> 03:47:09.926]  This was all in the textbooks at the PhD level in the 60s, how they would end the family.
[03:47:09.926 --> 03:47:15.807]  Send the women all to work, break up the family, destroy the male role models, every sitcom, every drama.
[03:47:15.807 --> 03:47:17.387]  The dad's an idiot.
[03:47:17.387 --> 03:47:18.107]  This is it.
[03:47:18.107 --> 03:47:20.488]  It's the end of the species as we know it.
[03:47:21.041 --> 03:47:32.835]  With Facebook with 50 different genders and 50 different bathrooms, a hamstrung, confused, insane species that doesn't know man, woman, get together, make next generation.
[03:47:32.835 --> 03:47:34.377]  This is high tech!
[03:47:35.359 --> 03:47:41.362]  At MIT, Harvard Psychology, weapons systems on record.
[03:47:41.362 --> 03:47:44.064]  And so that's what's happening, and that's what we're fighting.
[03:47:44.064 --> 03:47:54.550]  And you've got all these wrecked people sitting in front of TVs their whole lives, no mom, no dad, going to worthless college educations, and all they learn about is the 50 genders and what proper words to use.
[03:47:55.094 --> 03:47:55.715]  Yes, sir.
[03:48:11.437 --> 03:48:11.757]  Right on.
[03:48:11.757 --> 03:48:15.801]  It's interesting that you felt the need to call into this point, because I think it is the most important point.
[03:48:15.801 --> 03:48:23.847]  That people are being conditioned 100%, whether it's through themselves or the political correctness system, whatever, just like you just said.
[03:48:23.847 --> 03:48:26.949]  Everyone is just, oh, oh, we can't offend other people.
[03:48:26.949 --> 03:48:29.271]  We have to choose from 50 genders on Facebook.
[03:48:29.271 --> 03:48:30.432]  Nothing is real anymore.
[03:48:30.432 --> 03:48:34.115]  But what you were saying, Joe, too, is people also aren't buying into it.
[03:48:34.115 --> 03:48:35.076]  And that's the biggest victory.
[03:48:35.236 --> 03:48:41.779]  I mean, I was talking to David Knight earlier and he's, like he was saying, in some other countries they still call the bathrooms privies for privacy.
[03:48:41.779 --> 03:48:43.879]  When you go into a restroom, you kind of want to feel comfortable.
[03:48:43.879 --> 03:48:58.725]  You want to be able to let your guard down, you know, do your business, you know, freshen up whatever you need to do and walk off and not have to worry, you know, if some crazy person might walk in there to do something because you said not everybody out there, not transgender people in general, are going to do bad things.
[03:48:58.725 --> 03:48:59.746]  They just want to use the bathroom.
[03:49:00.506 --> 03:49:04.912]  But there's always going to be that whack job who's going to use that to come in there and do something.
[03:49:04.912 --> 03:49:10.180]  And we can't sacrifice our safety and our privacy for this.
[03:49:10.180 --> 03:49:16.409]  And the most ridiculous part, I'll say it once again, and then I was reminded I really have to talk about something at Infowarslife.com.
[03:49:17.318 --> 03:49:27.302]  The most ridiculous part is you will be called transphobic, you will be called homophobic, I will be called the same thing, but I'm sitting here saying, great, you want to be transsexual?
[03:49:27.302 --> 03:49:28.202]  You want to be gay?
[03:49:28.202 --> 03:49:30.023]  Or whatever the proper term is now?
[03:49:30.023 --> 03:49:30.823]  Good, who cares?
[03:49:30.823 --> 03:49:31.223]  Awesome.
[03:49:31.223 --> 03:49:31.843]  Great.
[03:49:31.843 --> 03:49:32.864]  Good for you.
[03:49:32.864 --> 03:49:34.664]  You are a free human being.
[03:49:34.664 --> 03:49:36.605]  But it doesn't mean we can't talk about these things.
[03:49:36.605 --> 03:49:37.726]  And that's the most ridiculous part.
[03:49:37.726 --> 03:49:40.447]  You'll be attacked for discussing anything.
[03:49:40.447 --> 03:49:41.247]  Anyway... It's great as dying.
[03:49:41.727 --> 03:49:43.689]  We have to mention InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:49:43.689 --> 03:49:44.830]  You really need to check it out.
[03:49:44.830 --> 03:49:46.672]  There are so many new products on there.
[03:49:46.672 --> 03:49:48.574]  I can't even begin to tell you.
[03:49:48.574 --> 03:49:53.158]  First of all, you have the Make America Free Again hat, which you can see on InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:49:53.158 --> 03:49:53.839]  Jill wearing it.
[03:49:53.839 --> 03:49:54.819]  I think we have one back there.
[03:49:54.819 --> 03:49:56.481]  You should put it on.
[03:49:56.481 --> 03:49:57.602]  So you can get that.
[03:49:57.602 --> 03:49:58.783]  It looks super classy.
[03:49:58.783 --> 03:50:00.585]  As you saw Alex wear triple hats.

[03:50:31.743 --> 03:50:33.724]  We need to get a Make America Free hat in here.
[03:50:33.724 --> 03:50:35.445]  We need all three for Joe to wear too.
[03:50:35.445 --> 03:50:36.746]  He deserves that photo op as well.
[03:50:36.746 --> 03:50:40.128]  All right, we'll be right back with some more news and information.
[03:50:40.128 --> 03:50:43.430]  This is the Alex Jones Show Fourth Hour.
[03:50:43.430 --> 03:50:44.431]  Which camera am I going to look at?
[03:50:51.510 --> 03:50:51.590]  Yeah.
[03:50:59.355 --> 03:51:06.362]  It's no secret that pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, moles, and fungus can inflict severe damage in the human body.
[03:51:06.362 --> 03:51:11.007]  Fortunately, a new and vastly improved silver solution has been developed.

[03:51:36.715 --> 03:51:37.255]  We're good to go.
[03:51:58.644 --> 03:52:03.486]  Wildfires, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, a crashing economy.

[03:52:04.587 --> 03:52:07.348]  At best, your local stores have a three-day supply of food.
[03:52:07.348 --> 03:52:09.710]  Will your family have to fight over what's left?

[03:53:03.044 --> 03:53:06.628]  Are you one of the 70% of Americans who hate their jobs?
[03:53:06.628 --> 03:53:09.271]  Do you wish you could work for yourself but don't know what to do?

[03:53:48.155 --> 03:53:48.415]  Call 1-800-215-3334.
[03:53:48.415 --> 03:53:48.695]  That's 1-800-215-3334.
[03:53:48.695 --> 03:53:48.755]  1-800-215-3334.
[03:54:06.835 --> 03:54:09.217]  Alright, so let's get to the most important thing first.
[03:54:09.217 --> 03:54:11.479]  We've got Joe Biggs here.
[03:54:11.479 --> 03:54:17.104]  Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs with his triage of Make America Free Again hats.
[03:54:17.104 --> 03:54:17.685]  Look at this.
[03:54:17.685 --> 03:54:18.706]  Look at this style.
[03:54:18.706 --> 03:54:21.669]  Look at this unique level of style we've got going on here.
[03:54:21.669 --> 03:54:23.851]  Hashtag Mafa on TV.
[03:54:23.851 --> 03:54:25.752]  Mafa, Make America Free Again.
[03:54:26.673 --> 03:54:27.774]  It's the most important part.
[03:54:27.774 --> 03:54:30.015]  Can't make it great without making it free, right?
[03:54:30.015 --> 03:54:31.676]  So anyway, a little bit of humor.
[03:54:31.676 --> 03:54:37.839]  But, maybe to get a little bit serious, we take the hats off for a second and talk about some of these solutions.
[03:54:37.839 --> 03:54:41.181]  So, we're talking on the break, and you brought up a good point.
[03:54:41.181 --> 03:54:46.684]  We don't want to just sit here and just trash everything and just spew and say, this is crap, you know, this is stupid.
[03:54:46.684 --> 03:54:47.105]  Yeah, it is.
[03:54:47.745 --> 03:54:49.326]  But what's the actual solution?
[03:54:49.326 --> 03:54:50.087]  You had a good point.
[03:54:50.087 --> 03:54:54.551]  Because, you know, yeah, OK, the transgender people, what are they going to do?
[03:54:54.551 --> 03:54:59.215]  OK, if they're going to obviously petition to continue to use, you know, bathrooms that are appropriate.
[03:54:59.215 --> 03:55:00.576]  So what do you think is the answer?
[03:55:00.576 --> 03:55:05.720]  I mean, I think you're getting to do with, you know, you have these large corporations, Walmart, Target, all these places like that.
[03:55:05.720 --> 03:55:06.561]  They've got money.
[03:55:06.561 --> 03:55:09.304]  You can add an extra restroom is for transgender.
[03:55:09.944 --> 03:55:10.664]  Whatever.
[03:55:10.664 --> 03:55:11.905]  Just unisex, whatever.
[03:55:11.905 --> 03:55:14.367]  And then that way everyone gets to be comfortable.
[03:55:14.367 --> 03:55:18.509]  Because like I said, there's a 0.03% of people in America that are transgendered.
[03:55:18.509 --> 03:55:23.952]  So we still have a large amount of people who aren't and don't feel comfortable with someone else being there.
[03:55:23.952 --> 03:55:25.413]  So that's an easy solution.
[03:55:25.413 --> 03:55:27.514]  And then smaller coffee shops, they're just unisex.
[03:55:27.514 --> 03:55:29.115]  They usually have one restroom.
[03:55:29.115 --> 03:55:30.255]  That's fine.
[03:55:30.255 --> 03:55:36.519]  But when you have these large places with separate ones for a reason, because you separate it because people want privacy, they want to feel comfortable.
[03:55:37.281 --> 03:55:39.942]  Then if you want to do that, build another stall.
[03:55:39.942 --> 03:55:41.082]  It's not that hard.
[03:55:41.082 --> 03:55:55.767]  Or make the family restroom that they have, where people can go in that one stall and say it's unisex, family, trans this and that, wheelchair, whatever you guys want to put on there to make everyone politically correct and happy when they look and see their sign that has all the guy with pants and half a skirt on or whatever.
[03:55:55.767 --> 03:55:56.287]  That's fine.
[03:55:56.587 --> 03:55:59.690]  You know, I go to most restaurants and stuff, there are unisex bathrooms.
[03:55:59.690 --> 03:56:01.352]  And no one seems to have an issue with it.
[03:56:01.352 --> 03:56:04.856]  The problem is that there's going to be a group of people for everything, on every side.
[03:56:04.856 --> 03:56:07.299]  On every single side that are going to be furious no matter what you do.
[03:56:07.299 --> 03:56:09.041]  You can't make everyone happy.
[03:56:09.041 --> 03:56:11.303]  People just want a thing to complain about.
[03:56:11.303 --> 03:56:12.945]  You know, not saying this isn't an issue.
[03:56:12.945 --> 03:56:16.128]  Just saying, in general, people are going to complain about everything.
[03:56:16.128 --> 03:56:16.609]  Meanwhile...
[03:56:18.086 --> 03:56:20.769]  Companies like Apple just aren't even paying tax.
[03:56:20.769 --> 03:56:27.316]  And Steve Wozniak in The Guardian, this is an article, Apple should pay more tax, says co-founder Steve Wozniak.
[03:56:27.316 --> 03:56:33.583]  One of TechGiant's founders says company under investigation by EU over its tax arrangements should pay the same 50% tax rate as he does.
[03:56:34.420 --> 03:56:42.125]  So, speaking to the BBC, he expressed his comfort with reports that Apple avoids tax, saying that paying taxes was just part of life, something that every company in the world should do.
[03:56:42.125 --> 03:56:46.848]  But, of course, not every major company in the world pays taxes.
[03:56:46.848 --> 03:56:53.032]  They have billions of dollars that go through other countries and offshore holding accounts and everything, and they pay no tax dollars.
[03:56:53.032 --> 03:56:58.676]  And there are, I think, 22 different companies that are above the several billion cap that CBS has.
[03:56:58.676 --> 03:57:02.519]  You know, GE's never paid taxes, Apple's not paying as much tax.
[03:57:02.519 --> 03:57:04.140]  All these companies are just not paying taxes.
[03:57:05.101 --> 03:57:11.746]  And then, people go on television, politicians, and say, yes, we need to tax people making $100,000.
[03:57:11.746 --> 03:57:16.210]  Oh, okay, what about the corporations making $50 billion?
[03:57:16.210 --> 03:57:17.931]  Well, they're fine, they're exempt.
[03:57:17.931 --> 03:57:24.717]  But see, we're too busy arguing about stuff like transgendered bathrooms to realize, well, gee, we should probably fix the country.
[03:57:24.717 --> 03:57:25.437]  You know what?
[03:57:25.437 --> 03:57:27.299]  I just don't think I want to pay taxes anymore.
[03:57:27.819 --> 03:57:34.327]  Right now, today, I identify as a man who doesn't believe in taxes, so if the IRS comes after me, you know what?
[03:57:34.327 --> 03:57:36.950]  Hey, I'm going to file a lawsuit against them.
[03:57:36.950 --> 03:57:37.731]  This is my right.
[03:57:37.731 --> 03:57:38.812]  This is who I am.
[03:57:38.812 --> 03:57:45.581]  I'm transitioning into an American named Joe Biggs who does not believe in taxes or that system whatsoever.
[03:57:45.581 --> 03:57:46.982]  See you guys next year.
[03:57:47.703 --> 03:57:49.064]  Uh, don't send me any letters.
[03:57:49.064 --> 03:57:50.344]  I think it's a solid plan, actually.
[03:57:50.344 --> 03:57:55.447]  I'm going to identify as someone who doesn't pay taxes either, because I pay very much high taxes.
[03:57:55.447 --> 03:57:57.988]  And then the companies don't pay taxes, don't do anything, loot the country.
[03:57:57.988 --> 03:58:02.811]  The banks are making $183 billion in taxpayer, or was it $83 billion, in taxpayer revenue.
[03:58:02.811 --> 03:58:07.313]  I mean, but we gotta get these bathrooms under control, Figs.
[03:58:07.313 --> 03:58:09.554]  There's ISIS slaughtering people, cutting people's heads off.
[03:58:09.554 --> 03:58:10.655]  We're about bathrooms all day.
[03:58:11.295 --> 03:58:11.676]  Anyway.
[03:58:11.676 --> 03:58:12.837]  Alright, I'll tell you what.
[03:58:12.837 --> 03:58:15.259]  We'll be back on Sunday.
[03:58:15.259 --> 03:58:16.220]  Alex will be back.
[03:58:16.220 --> 03:58:19.003]  Alex Jones will be back in studio from 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:58:19.003 --> 03:58:19.544]  Central.
[03:58:19.544 --> 03:58:20.525]  Sunday.
[03:58:20.525 --> 03:58:21.906]  Standard time.
[03:58:21.906 --> 03:58:22.787]  Thanks so much for joining us.
[03:58:22.787 --> 03:58:23.508]  Lots of craziness.
[03:58:23.508 --> 03:58:24.289]  Lots of news.
[03:58:24.289 --> 03:58:25.090]  Lots of stacks.
[03:58:25.090 --> 03:58:26.872]  Joe, thanks a lot for coming on here.
[03:58:26.872 --> 03:58:27.833]  Make America free again.
[03:58:27.833 --> 03:58:28.513]  There you go.
[03:58:28.513 --> 03:58:29.474]  Make America free again.
[03:58:29.474 --> 03:58:30.896]  Alright, thanks so much for watching.
[03:58:30.896 --> 03:58:31.717]  Alex will be back on Sunday.
