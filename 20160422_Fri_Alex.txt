[00:00.000 --> 00:19.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:30.000 --> 00:39.000]  I'm sure it's a coincidence that Earth Day is Vladimir Lenin's birthday.
[00:39.000 --> 00:45.000]  And I'm sure it's a coincidence that May Day is the big communist celebration day,
[00:45.000 --> 00:49.000]  and it's also one of the high occultic days in Europe.
[00:49.000 --> 00:51.000]  Of course, none of it is a coincidence.
[00:51.000 --> 00:54.000]  If you know real history, undisputed real history,
[00:54.000 --> 01:04.000]  it is the Jacobin movement of the Bavarian Illuminati that took over France later,
[01:04.000 --> 01:08.000]  that has established everything we're now basically living under.
[01:08.000 --> 01:12.000]  It is the counter, counterfeit renaissance.
[01:12.000 --> 01:14.000]  It is the counter to the Enlightenment.
[01:14.000 --> 01:22.000]  It's the New Dark Age, packaged as the Enlightenment, just so everybody knows.
[01:22.000 --> 01:29.000]  And we've got Mark Moreno of Climate Depot, congressional advisor, you name it, joining us to break all this down.
[01:29.000 --> 01:32.000]  We may have the founder of the Weather Channel on today as well.
[01:32.000 --> 01:35.000]  He's been on before to talk about it here on Earth Day,
[01:35.000 --> 01:39.000]  and some of the latest anti-human initiatives that are being carried out by these people.
[01:39.000 --> 01:45.000]  And then we also have ManCal contacted, I guess, Niko, my producer this morning.
[01:45.000 --> 01:49.000]  I was wanting to get him on next week for a full hour to talk about the election.
[01:49.000 --> 01:54.000]  A syndicated radio host, Discovery Channel, TV host, everybody knows ManCal, smart guy.
[01:54.000 --> 01:56.000]  And he called Niko back this morning and said,
[01:56.000 --> 01:58.000]  well, let me pop in for 10 minutes this week and an hour next week.
[01:58.000 --> 02:01.000]  I want to talk about Prince, who I know was a frequent guest on this show,
[02:01.000 --> 02:05.000]  but I didn't know, I guess ManCal had told me that Prince was a listener of the show
[02:05.000 --> 02:07.000]  and had actually talked about the broadcast.
[02:07.000 --> 02:10.000]  And it's not about, oh, we got talked about by Prince.
[02:10.000 --> 02:12.000]  Oh, wow, we're so big.
[02:12.000 --> 02:20.000]  It's that I don't really know any artist or celebrity that is off the reservation that isn't a listener.
[02:20.000 --> 02:23.000]  I mean, why wouldn't they be?
[02:23.000 --> 02:29.000]  It just shows the solidarity out there when you know a Kurt Russell knows what's going on,
[02:29.000 --> 02:34.000]  or Jeff Bridges or a artist like Prince.
[02:34.000 --> 02:37.000]  But I mean, it was obvious Prince knew what was going on.
[02:37.000 --> 02:40.000]  Years ago, he'd go on TV and talk about world government,
[02:40.000 --> 02:44.000]  private fellow reserve were all slaves, New World Order,
[02:44.000 --> 02:48.000]  geoengineering, chemtrailing.
[02:48.000 --> 02:52.000]  By the way, Merle Haggard also just died a few weeks ago, as you know,
[02:52.000 --> 02:56.000]  and he complained about chemtrails and thought it turns out he had actually his old newspapers
[02:56.000 --> 03:00.000]  that he thought it was giving him, he and others, respiratory problems.
[03:00.000 --> 03:02.000]  And by the way, both of them were having respiratory problems.
[03:02.000 --> 03:04.000]  They thought he first had died of the flu.
[03:04.000 --> 03:07.000]  The other thing could have been an overdose on medication he was taking for the flu
[03:07.000 --> 03:09.000]  and some other mystery illness.
[03:09.000 --> 03:15.000]  Regardless, obviously, it's a low probability that geoengineering chemicals
[03:15.000 --> 03:18.000]  outright kill these two guys, but it's killing plant life.
[03:18.000 --> 03:19.000]  It's hurting the earth.
[03:19.000 --> 03:24.000]  It's leading to all sorts of problems with people's lungs.
[03:24.000 --> 03:26.000]  I mean, that's coming out in the news.
[03:26.000 --> 03:30.000]  And then mainstream media acts like we're crazy and says there's no chemtrailing going on
[03:30.000 --> 03:33.000]  and they go, silly, that's ice crystals.
[03:33.000 --> 03:34.000]  Yeah, I know.
[03:34.000 --> 03:40.000]  And you only get condensation trails in the winter, generally anywhere below 10,000 feet.
[03:40.000 --> 03:43.000]  In the summer, it's got to be up 20, 30,000 feet.
[03:43.000 --> 03:52.000]  I see jets fly over at 5,000, 10,000 feet in July and leave these big trails that sit there for an hour
[03:52.000 --> 03:56.000]  and then expand into this rainbow chemical haze.
[03:56.000 --> 04:01.000]  And then I've got thousands of patents, thousands.
[04:01.000 --> 04:04.000]  And they gave a Nobel Prize in 92.
[04:04.000 --> 04:05.000]  You can look this up.
[04:05.000 --> 04:06.000]  I forget his name.
[04:06.000 --> 04:16.000]  Some top scientist, meteorologist, who proposed adding barium-salt salinum dioxide to the jet fuel
[04:16.000 --> 04:21.000]  and that it would then be aerosolized and turn into particula through the jet engine.
[04:21.000 --> 04:25.000]  So the airlines, except for the top executives, don't even know about this.
[04:25.000 --> 04:30.000]  It's done by government mandate like putting fluoride in the water.
[04:30.000 --> 04:33.000]  In the old days, when they cared about us, iodine and salt.
[04:33.000 --> 04:38.000]  It's going on and it's multifaceted and they admit they're doing it.
[04:38.000 --> 04:41.000]  They just say the details are secret.
[04:41.000 --> 04:50.000]  I mean, in 1979, a global treaty was signed, including by the U.S. to limit weather weapons and aerosol spraying.
[04:50.000 --> 04:52.000]  It's going on, okay?
[04:52.000 --> 04:59.000]  And the point is Prince and Merle Haggard were worried about it, so we should bring it up.
[04:59.000 --> 05:06.000]  A recent story by the Financial Times confirms that Daesh, also known as the Islamic State, was created in part by the Saudis.
[05:06.000 --> 05:12.000]  According to the late Saudi Foreign Minister, Islamic State was cobbled together in response to the Shia government in Iraq
[05:12.000 --> 05:16.000]  following the U.S. invasion of the country and the execution of Saddam Hussein.
[05:16.000 --> 05:23.000]  The story ignores the fact the Saudis collaborated with the CIA and Pakistani intelligence to create the Afghan Arabs,
[05:23.000 --> 05:32.000]  which will become al-Qaeda. Other factions of the CIA organized in Saudi-funded Mujahideen coalesced into another fanatical Wahhabi group, the Taliban.
[05:32.000 --> 05:38.000]  In 2006, al-Qaeda in Iraq merged with several other Sunni Wahhabi groups to form the Islamic State of Iraq.
[05:38.000 --> 05:42.000]  When the group moved into Syria in 2013, it became ISIS.
[05:42.000 --> 05:49.000]  The missing 28 pages will allegedly show Saudi complicity in the 9-11 attacks, but it will not show the role played by the CIA.
[05:49.000 --> 05:54.000]  The same can be said for the role played by the CIA and the Pentagon in the creation of terrorist groups.

[06:38.000 --> 06:44.000]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff, just cover that up for a while, but then burn you out in my experience,
[06:44.000 --> 06:50.000]  whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source, so it's pretty exciting and I love it.

[08:01.000 --> 08:11.000]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[08:11.000 --> 08:19.000]  Thomas Jefferson. It's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[08:19.000 --> 08:42.000]  Weeks flash by like the twinkle in your child's eye. It's Friday, the 22nd day of April 2016. I'm your host Alex Jones. We'll be here for the next four hours as we are weekdays 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central Standard Time.
[08:42.000 --> 08:50.000]  And I will return live in studio this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m. Central.
[08:50.000 --> 09:06.000]  There is so much again incredibly important news today that I want to break down. We will be covering Earth Day that has been established as a world government anti-human eugenics holiday by the U.N. celebrating, of course,
[09:06.000 --> 09:14.000]  Vladimir Lenin's birthday of the same day. And we will be looking at that with Mark Moreno today and a lot more.
[09:14.000 --> 09:29.000]  Also, did the Chem Trail Flu kill Prince and Merle Haggard? We asked that question yesterday. We're going to go through it because both men were concerned about respiratory issues dealing with the consistent,
[09:29.000 --> 09:42.000]  ongoing geo-engineering programs using a loan of dioxide, barium salts, and then other radioactive isotopes. And that's declassified. That's going on. The specifics are still secret.
[09:42.000 --> 09:48.000]  And they have lots of folks on Infowars.com and our article making fun of me saying, those are ice crystals, Alex.
[09:48.000 --> 10:02.000]  Yes, I know that aircraft up at a certain altitude, that the leading edge of the wings goes through the atmosphere and creates nuclei or concentrates water vapor.
[10:02.000 --> 10:08.000]  And then that freezes. And then the ice crystals disappear in about 30 seconds to a minute.
[10:08.000 --> 10:23.000]  And I was about two years old. One of my earliest memories is my father describing what those lines in the sky were. Starting in the early 90s, they began to stay in the air for hours and form giant cloud banks.
[10:23.000 --> 10:36.000]  And NASA came out and said, the earth is 20% darker. About 16 years ago. Then they said, it's 30% darker. And they said, persistent condensation trails are dimming the earth.
[10:36.000 --> 10:50.000]  That's BBC. I mean, just type in. Jet travel is making atmosphere darker. And its artificial pollution added to the jet fuel aerosolized through the jet engines.
[10:50.000 --> 11:00.000]  And we have the patents. There are hundreds on how to put it through the engines and how to have the fuel work better with the additives.
[11:00.000 --> 11:12.000]  And the secret government subsidy programs that are admitted to be $5 billion a year for the Department of Energy alone for the fuel additive.
[11:12.000 --> 11:22.000]  $5 billion in one program of spray cost. Just like we knew there was nothing secret.
[11:22.000 --> 11:30.000]  Oh, Smithsonian.com. Airplane contrails may be creating accidental geoengineering. That was last year.
[11:30.000 --> 11:41.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, the Council on Foreign Relations came out six years ago and admitted their chemtrailing everybody and said it's for your own good. Shut up.
[11:41.000 --> 11:48.000]  Three years ago, they came out with a headline. Why we need al-Qaeda in Syria and how good al-Qaeda is.
[11:48.000 --> 11:53.000]  The military didn't go along with this. They changed the name to ISIS. You're like, what's that to do with chemtrailing?
[11:53.000 --> 11:59.000]  They play these games. They've got programs much bigger than the Manhattan Project going on all over the place.
[11:59.000 --> 12:04.000]  Just what we know of is so freakish, I can't even believe it.
[12:04.000 --> 12:12.000]  And then I cut special reports showing scores of mainstream articles now admitting they're spraying us.
[12:12.000 --> 12:19.000]  High school textbooks admit they're adding it to jet fuel and that they're, quote, saving the earth from global warming with it because they know they got the younger generation.
[12:19.000 --> 12:22.000]  But to the older one, they go, oh, that doesn't exist.
[12:22.000 --> 12:28.000]  Just like Obamacare doesn't have death panels and doesn't increase your prices. And of course, now they admit it does.
[12:28.000 --> 12:31.000]  It's all just screw jobs.
[12:31.000 --> 12:41.000]  So we're going to play that Prince clip coming up. There's a couple of them where he talked about geoengineering and chemtrails and the Federal Reserve and all the rest of it.
[12:41.000 --> 12:49.000]  I talked about this yesterday within hours. There are a bunch of mainstream news articles making fun of me going.
[12:49.000 --> 12:55.000]  Alex Jones claims Prince thought this and Prince thought that. All I was doing was pointing out what he already said.
[12:55.000 --> 13:03.000]  But they didn't want people that were fans of him because he had so many hundreds of millions of fans around the world to actually look into what he discussed.
[13:03.000 --> 13:09.000]  So they just say it isn't true. That's how they deceive. Kind of like Ted Cruz going, I'm winning the popular vote.
[13:09.000 --> 13:18.000]  Democracy has spoken. I am winning. People voted in Colorado. People voted in all these states. I won 100%.
[13:18.000 --> 13:23.000]  And finally, Sean Hannity goes, no, you didn't stop saying that. My audience isn't buying it.
[13:23.000 --> 13:29.000]  And Hannity is kind of saying, man, you're on all the time. I've had you on more than anybody. Actually, he goes, I like you, but stop it.
[13:29.000 --> 13:37.000]  My audience is getting really mad. He's telling him Cruz, it ain't selling. Stop it.
[13:37.000 --> 13:43.000]  That's the level of craziness that this has now reached. Can you believe that? Cook, Matt, Roger, he said we should have voters in elections.
[13:43.000 --> 13:50.000]  Oh, yeah. But you notice that sales job in the last three weeks didn't work. So now the media is backtracking.
[13:50.000 --> 14:02.000]  Well, Renz Priebus, I have the clip, went on TV last night and actually said, oh, it doesn't matter now that he's going to get the 237 or the 1237 delegates,
[14:02.000 --> 14:11.000]  he needs to not be able to be blocked or to have a second vote on the delegates. We're just going to change the rules anyways.
[14:11.000 --> 14:21.000]  And he sits there with that con artist grin on his face going, of course you don't vote. What? You think this is a free country?
[14:21.000 --> 14:29.000]  That's why I make the joke that soon they'll say conspiracy theorists claim that women once breastfed or gave vaginal birth.
[14:29.000 --> 14:40.000]  But it's almost getting to that point now where we sent bigs out on the street yesterday. We're going to play this and talk to people about
[14:40.000 --> 14:49.000]  getting rid of genders in bathrooms so men can go in women's bathrooms and vice versa. And how undoubtedly perverts has always been a big pervert problem,
[14:49.000 --> 14:55.000]  you know, with a small minority of folks going into women's bathrooms and perving out. That's well known.
[14:55.000 --> 15:01.000]  There are station cops outside some areas where they start doing them. It's in the news. Now they can legally do it.
[15:01.000 --> 15:10.000]  So your new right is to be a perv and people are telling bigs, hey man, get with the program. It's 2016, buddy.
[15:10.000 --> 15:21.000]  We're told what to eat by Michelle Obama. We're told how to speak by the media. We're being taught how to be good little slaves, so that's coming up.
[15:21.000 --> 15:31.000]  And Chelsea Clinton, the videos on infowars.com, says gun control opportunity on Supreme Court with Scalia gone.
[15:31.000 --> 15:43.000]  That's right. Now that Scalia is gone, we can enact gun control. And see, my brain doesn't just look at one article and then not connect the dots.
[15:43.000 --> 15:53.000]  You know, they announced within hours of Prince being found dead yesterday that they would do a full autopsy. But with Antonin Scalia,
[15:53.000 --> 16:01.000]  the one man holding back open borders, gun confiscation, world government, WTO control of our country, UNESCO control,
[16:01.000 --> 16:14.000]  UN offices being set up in every major city to control local government in strong cities initiative, Schwarzenegger, quarterbacking it.
[16:14.000 --> 16:21.000]  He didn't get an autopsy. And then we had reporters on the show like Wayne Madsen and Joe Biggs and others.
[16:21.000 --> 16:31.000]  So smart, so tuned in, so dialed into their sixth sense that they both came on and said this looks like Bohemian Grove meets the shining.
[16:31.000 --> 16:36.000]  We smell Dick Cheney. We think this is a secret society operation.
[16:36.000 --> 16:45.000]  And then a month later, the Washington Post admitted that they're doing secret society rituals as a spinoff of Bohemian Grove there.
[16:45.000 --> 16:51.000]  Now, you want to talk about reporters that are smart.
[16:51.000 --> 16:57.000]  But here's the deal. We're on their tail. This is what we do.
[16:57.000 --> 17:08.000]  We understand what we're facing. I mean, they had paintings and sculptures of the devil eating small children and devil mask by the hundreds everywhere.
[17:08.000 --> 17:22.000]  Voodoo stuff, folks, not day of the dead stuff, not Halloween stuff. They had hardcore voodoo sanaria stuff everywhere and images of little children being murdered, being eaten by demons.
[17:22.000 --> 17:26.000]  And we're like, whoa, this is like secret society. This is satanic.
[17:26.000 --> 17:30.000]  So I guess, I mean, in a way, I'm saying they're savvy, but it's right in your face.
[17:30.000 --> 17:41.000]  But they said like Bohemian Grove, boom, boom, boom, boom, Bohemian Grove satellite, boom, run by black ops, boom, right as usual.
[17:41.000 --> 17:48.000]  Geopolitical world government books everywhere by Zabignan Brzezinski, David Rockefeller, you name it.
[17:48.000 --> 17:56.000]  No autopsy for Antonin Scalia, but for Prince, there'll be an autopsy.
[17:56.000 --> 18:01.000]  Nothing to see here. Move along, move along, move along.
[18:01.000 --> 18:04.000]  So that's just some of what we're going to be breaking down here on Earth Day.
[18:04.000 --> 18:05.000]  Mark Moreno is going to be joining us.
[18:05.000 --> 18:08.000]  Mankow's popping in at the bottom of the gallery because he was friends with Prince.
[18:08.000 --> 18:12.000]  One of the few radio shows that Prince would go on.
[18:12.000 --> 18:17.000]  And he wants to come on and talk about the fact that Prince was aware of the New World Order and would talk about it on Mankow's show.
[18:17.000 --> 18:23.000]  And Mankow's trying to dig around to find, it's hard when you've got all these hour-long interviews to find right where they're saying it, but it's interesting.
[18:23.000 --> 18:29.000]  I wish I had answered the phone a few months ago when Mankow and Jeff Bridges called me up.
[18:29.000 --> 18:31.000]  Jeff Bridges wanted to talk.
[18:31.000 --> 18:34.000]  I still haven't gotten around to trying to call Bridges. I'm going to do it.
[18:34.000 --> 18:38.000]  I almost felt like the psychological block to never call celebrities.
[18:38.000 --> 18:46.000]  It's weird. It's just, I mean, because if celebrities are awake to the New World Order, then they can be very, very useful and they know that towards waking people up.
[18:46.000 --> 18:50.000]  I mean, I love Kurt Russell, but I don't just like somebody because they're a celebrity.
[18:50.000 --> 18:56.000]  I mean, I have to like them. I like their acting. Love Kurt Russell. Love the dude. Love Jeff Bridges.
[18:56.000 --> 19:03.000]  Love Bruce Willis. And it turns out they're all listeners. It's really cool.
[19:03.000 --> 19:11.000]  It's like everybody I like thinks like me. And then everybody I hate and can't stand to watch is a globalist piece of trash.
[19:11.000 --> 19:17.000]  It just figures. Clint Eastwood. Love Clint Eastwood. He's aware of what's going on.
[19:17.000 --> 19:22.000]  I know he listens to one of our affiliates and is told, swirling the owner that he listens to some of the shows.
[19:22.000 --> 19:29.000]  He hasn't said mine, but I'm a big fan of obviously probably the greatest actor ever, Clint Eastwood.
[19:29.000 --> 19:33.000]  But I'm digressing. We have big fish to fry and serious issues to cover.
[19:33.000 --> 19:38.000]  And the woods are lovely, dark and deep, but I have miles to go before I sleep.
[19:38.000 --> 19:41.000]  I know he did call in on Michael Savage once and confirmed it.

[23:01.000 --> 23:06.000]  It's true, some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[23:06.000 --> 23:08.000]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.

[24:18.000 --> 24:22.000]  Man Cow is going to be popping in about his experiences with Prince.
[24:22.000 --> 24:27.000]  Interviews he has, he's going to be getting to us soon where Prince talked about world government, the new world order.
[24:27.000 --> 24:39.000]  I think that's really important to understand that he was an evil conspiracy theorist who questioned the known liars that are attempting to swallow up all of humanity into their technotronic eugenics-based slave pit.
[24:39.000 --> 24:43.000]  So he'll pop in for about 10 minutes and then I'm going to segue off into a whole bunch of news.
[24:43.000 --> 24:54.000]  Obama is over in England at her Britannic Majesties Palace last night and today having lavish meals celebrating her birthday.
[24:54.000 --> 24:57.000]  Happy belated birthday, Your Majesty.
[24:57.000 --> 25:06.000]  Obama launches with the Queen as storm over Britain exiting the Euro rages.
[25:06.000 --> 25:14.000]  As the Queen turns 90, report values British monarchy at $84 billion.
[25:14.000 --> 25:26.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, her cousin, Queen Beatrix, who advocated a few years ago to the new king, her son, owns Dutch roll shell and BP with her.
[25:26.000 --> 25:35.000]  Her assets, the Dutch Queen, are a state secret but are estimated to be in the tens of trillions.
[25:35.000 --> 25:40.000]  And they're junior to their cousins, the Transylvanian crown.
[25:40.000 --> 25:42.000]  And I don't just say that for effect, folks, look it up.
[25:42.000 --> 25:48.000]  See, truth's always 10 times stranger than anything you can make up.
[25:48.000 --> 25:52.000]  Prince Charles basically lives in Transylvania now. Totally insane.
[25:52.000 --> 25:57.000]  He's actually moved into Dracula Castle. I'm not making it up.
[25:57.000 --> 26:04.000]  And he looks just like him and he points out, look at the painting of Columbus Dracula.
[26:04.000 --> 26:10.000]  And this is the original progenitors who then took over Germania and then took over England.
[26:10.000 --> 26:14.000]  It's amazing. But I'm digressing. We're going to get into that.
[26:14.000 --> 26:16.000]  We're going to get into Chelsea Clinton coming out of the guns.
[26:16.000 --> 26:22.000]  We're going to get into political correctness now coming out of the closet and saying,
[26:22.000 --> 26:25.000]  look, we're just here to arrest you if you use the wrong words.
[26:25.000 --> 26:30.000]  That's all being announced. It's all coming up in a key video that ties us all together.
[26:30.000 --> 26:35.000]  Man attacked, left for dead, run over by a cab. Cab didn't even stop.
[26:35.000 --> 26:39.000]  Bystanders do nothing.
[26:39.000 --> 26:44.000]  These are true zombies and it's happening all over the world now where they don't help a woman
[26:44.000 --> 26:48.000]  being raped in front of everyone or someone's choking and no one helps them and they die.
[26:48.000 --> 26:53.000]  And they just chirp 911, 911 and call it. I've seen it myself.
[26:53.000 --> 26:56.000]  And they think it's cool that they don't care about anybody.
[26:56.000 --> 27:02.000]  Soft, greedy, petulant, weak, evil people.
[27:02.000 --> 27:07.000]  And they are becoming the majority and they will see us the producers as food.
[27:07.000 --> 27:13.000]  Now I have a couple of really exciting announcements here.
[27:13.000 --> 27:20.000]  I bought for myself and my family and others some of the obnoxious ultra redneck,
[27:20.000 --> 27:25.000]  the type of hats grandpa would wear when he went fishing, make America great again hats.
[27:25.000 --> 27:27.000]  And they're made to America.
[27:27.000 --> 27:31.000]  Well, we've come out with a variant that I believe is better.
[27:31.000 --> 27:34.000]  And it's make America free again.
[27:34.000 --> 27:38.000]  We have it in camouflage with orange lettering.
[27:38.000 --> 27:43.000]  Infowars.com helps support the info war and get the word out.
[27:43.000 --> 27:51.000]  And we have it in the obnoxious royal blue on white and we have it in the super ultra redneck
[27:51.000 --> 27:57.000]  fire engine red. And then on the back it says info wars.com with a coiled snake.
[27:57.000 --> 28:00.000]  And I think make America great again is fantastic.
[28:00.000 --> 28:03.000]  It's wonderful. And I admire the taste in the hats.
[28:03.000 --> 28:07.000]  And so the most sincere form of flattery is imitation.
[28:07.000 --> 28:10.000]  But these are not a ripoff of the Trump hats because they're made in America.
[28:10.000 --> 28:13.000]  They're high quality. They're very similar, but it's different language.
[28:13.000 --> 28:17.000]  Make America free again. And then info wars.com and the Gadsden snake on the back.
[28:17.000 --> 28:23.000]  So you see about 10% of the folks that Trump rallies are wearing are Hillary for prison shirts.
[28:23.000 --> 28:25.000]  Some of the things like that. And Trump gets really excited when he sees it.
[28:25.000 --> 28:30.000]  So I'd like to see him pick up the make America free again so America can be great again.
[28:30.000 --> 28:33.000]  And these hats just came in a limited run.
[28:33.000 --> 28:38.000]  And they're made to America because of all the tariffs and all the regulations and all the garbage.
[28:38.000 --> 28:43.000]  You know, these babies cost us like 14 smackers a piece of the highest quality to make them in America.
[28:43.000 --> 28:47.000]  So they're $29.95. Same price Trump sells his hats for. And I know why.
[28:47.000 --> 28:49.000]  Because you've got to have a profit to run your operation.
[28:49.000 --> 29:01.000]  And just like you buy Trump's hats and t-shirts that are excellent and I have to help fund his campaign, you should help fund our information warfare operation and get these hats that will never go out of season and never go out of style.
[29:01.000 --> 29:04.000]  Make America free again.
[29:04.000 --> 29:14.000]  Infowars.com and the Hillary shirts say Hillary for prison 2016 on the back. It says legalize freedom in red info wars.com.
[29:14.000 --> 29:20.000]  And your purchase of the apparel makes everything we do here possible. The nutraceuticals as well.
[29:20.000 --> 29:26.000]  By the way, there are big studies out. It's even in scientific American. You name it.
[29:26.000 --> 29:37.000]  I can't believe they're even admitting the truth that vitamin B 12 deficiency is linked to schizophrenia, mental illness, autism and so much more.
[29:37.000 --> 29:57.000]  How many times have we told you that and they admit it's absorption in the gut? That's why you've got to get it sublingually.
[29:57.000 --> 30:11.000]  Is the British government more worried about transgender bathrooms than ISIS? This week it emerged that ISIS was plotting to attack tourist beaches across Europe by posing as vendors and placing bombs under sunbeds.
[30:11.000 --> 30:18.000]  Meanwhile in North Carolina, people are being required by a new law to use public bathrooms that correspond with their biological gender.
[30:18.000 --> 30:33.000]  So which grave threat to the Brits traveling overseas? Did the British Foreign Office decide to warn its citizens about? That's right. They wanted travelers to be aware of the controversial new bathroom laws in North Carolina and Mississippi before visiting the U.S.
[30:33.000 --> 30:44.000]  30 British citizens were slaughtered on a beach by ISIS jihadists in Tunisia less than a year ago. ISIS frequently calls for the execution of members of the LGBT community.
[30:44.000 --> 30:51.000]  The Foreign Office issues a warning about bathroom laws yet ignores the terror threat to attack tourist beaches.
[30:51.000 --> 31:18.000]  For more on the absurdity, visit infowars.com right now.
[31:18.000 --> 31:25.000]  It's so easy to get these incredible nutraceuticals that support your health and the info war at the same time.
[31:25.000 --> 31:48.000]  I'm a nine-year listener. I buy all the nutraceuticals, cardio effects, nascent eye-dye.
[31:48.000 --> 31:58.000]  That's infowars.com.
[32:18.000 --> 32:23.000]  When you sign up for auto ship because we hold back a surplus for auto ship customers.
[32:23.000 --> 32:28.000]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.

[32:42.000 --> 32:48.000]  No, I coined the term 360 win and with the new auto ship feature at infowarslife.com, this is a sure win.
[32:48.000 --> 32:54.000]  10% off on auto ship. Win, win, win at infowarslife.com, free shipping on orders above $50.
[32:54.000 --> 33:09.000]  And all out of stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for auto ship.
[33:09.000 --> 33:15.000]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side.
[33:15.000 --> 33:34.000]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[33:34.000 --> 33:43.000]  We don't normally cover a lot of entertainment news unless it's to analyze different messages that are in that news that deal with human liberty and freedom.
[33:43.000 --> 33:56.000]  But really I should spend more time on it. We're starting to do that analyzing popular culture because more than 80% of propaganda and globalist brainwashing is going on in the popular media, in the fictional media.
[33:56.000 --> 34:04.000]  Now in some cases people like Chris Carter comes out in magazine interviews and we've talked to him now, I'm going to go out there and meet him soon, been too busy to.
[34:04.000 --> 34:08.000]  And he's like, no, I like Alex Jones. I think world government is a threat.
[34:08.000 --> 34:16.000]  And I think what he talks about is really true and I base our new episodes basically on his research mixed in with space aliens.
[34:16.000 --> 34:26.000]  So there is a point at which we become so successful in the fight against the globalist and we show the proof of what they're doing.
[34:26.000 --> 34:35.000]  That folks that have been in the establishment but but but not part of the agenda are going to start really trying to help empower and awaken humanity.
[34:35.000 --> 34:36.000]  And that's happening.
[34:36.000 --> 34:43.000]  And the sheer numbers of people in Hollywood, which is the dominant culture driver of the world.
[34:43.000 --> 34:51.000]  The sheer numbers of people who are libertarian or who are pro human or who are anti new world order or conservative is huge.
[34:51.000 --> 34:55.000]  A lot of the people that claim they're liberal on the surface go to these secret meetings.
[34:55.000 --> 35:06.000]  And the London Guardian has a big headline about it today that this big secret society of conservatives that I know man cows actually been part of is dissolving right now.
[35:06.000 --> 35:10.000]  Because people are so scared they're being penetrated they're being infiltrated.
[35:10.000 --> 35:16.000]  In America you've got to be in a secret society to be Christian or libertarian or conservative.
[35:16.000 --> 35:19.000]  But Kurt Russell came out and said look I'm just 1776.
[35:19.000 --> 35:22.000]  I'm Renaissance. I'm Americana.
[35:22.000 --> 35:25.000]  I'm not conservative. I'm not liberal.
[35:25.000 --> 35:33.000]  And it's the same thing out of Jeff Bridges are so many other people that folks like man cow because he does focus on entertainment half the time has known over the years.
[35:33.000 --> 35:36.000]  So he's it's always interesting all the people that man cows gotten on.
[35:36.000 --> 35:41.000]  He tells me hey Billy Corgan's a big listener. Now the last six seven years he's been on a lot. We're good friends.
[35:41.000 --> 35:44.000]  We've all hung out together here in town.
[35:44.000 --> 35:47.000]  It just goes on and on that every time man cow tells me somebody's awake.
[35:47.000 --> 35:49.000]  But he goes but you can't tell anybody it's private.
[35:49.000 --> 35:51.000]  And then later the person comes out.
[35:51.000 --> 36:00.000]  Not out of the closet as being gay but out of the closet as not wanting to turn their guns in or not wanting to ban the word mother or father.
[36:00.000 --> 36:06.000]  And Prince seen as liberal in a lot of ways was aware of the New World Order of the Federal Reserve.
[36:06.000 --> 36:08.000]  He was on Tavis Smiley show. He talked about it.
[36:08.000 --> 36:13.000]  But there are a bunch of interviews with man cow where he talked about a lot of it man cow dot com.
[36:13.000 --> 36:18.000]  Of course syndicated TV host radio host discovery channel shows you name it.
[36:18.000 --> 36:23.000]  He's syndicated out of the loop there in Chicago 97.9.
[36:23.000 --> 36:26.000]  And I want to get him on for a full hour to cover the waterfront.
[36:26.000 --> 36:30.000]  He said well I can't do that today but I want to pop in about Prince and what he was saying about Info Wars.
[36:30.000 --> 36:41.000]  Which is again not to puff us up this show up but to say see how popular our perspective on the world is because it's so accurate.
[36:41.000 --> 36:55.000]  I've had medical doctors and scientists on for over a decade saying vitamin B 12 deficiencies in the gut and nutrient upload in the gut caused by biological reactions with vaccines is linked to autism schizophrenia
[36:55.000 --> 37:00.000]  and rising mental illness. That's in major scientific journals today.
[37:00.000 --> 37:03.000]  I'm going to be covering later.
[37:03.000 --> 37:09.000]  Low B 12 seen in aging autism and schizophrenia.
[37:09.000 --> 37:13.000]  Decrease brain levels of vitamin B 12 in aging autism and schizophrenia major studies.
[37:13.000 --> 37:17.000]  I'm going to be showing you this. The point is this stuff's already all known.
[37:17.000 --> 37:21.000]  There's an admitted giant geoengineering program going on.
[37:21.000 --> 37:29.000]  The White House Science Zahar wrote a book in 1974 admitting they put fluoride in the water to lower your fertility and brain damage you.
[37:29.000 --> 37:31.000]  It just makes most people stupid and docile.
[37:31.000 --> 37:33.000]  But folks that weren't going to be real smart, it makes you retarded.
[37:33.000 --> 37:36.000]  But they go oh don't use the word retarded, that's hateful.
[37:36.000 --> 37:40.000]  But let us make you mentally retarded. See how political correctness works?
[37:40.000 --> 37:42.000]  So Mankow joins us.
[37:42.000 --> 37:46.000]  Then we're going to get into lawmakers optimistic secret 9-11 pages.
[37:46.000 --> 37:50.000]  We'll soon see release which shows our government stood down
[37:50.000 --> 37:54.000]  and that Saudi Arabia was running at least decoy hijackers
[37:54.000 --> 37:57.000]  and was putting money in their accounts to fund them all over the U.S.
[37:57.000 --> 38:01.000]  Something I told you 15 years ago vindicated again and I'm not up here bragging.
[38:01.000 --> 38:05.000]  Remember Mankow was on last time he goes it's now admitted giant blimps
[38:05.000 --> 38:08.000]  are government runner crashing all over the place.
[38:08.000 --> 38:15.000]  Folks, in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 they funded over 80 billion dollars
[38:15.000 --> 38:20.000]  over the next four years to put in giant NSA snooping hubs in every system
[38:20.000 --> 38:22.000]  of the U.S. to track you.
[38:22.000 --> 38:25.000]  The funding to put it in was all public.
[38:25.000 --> 38:27.000]  I had whistleblowers on.
[38:27.000 --> 38:31.000]  That's what's so frustrating is I'm not psychic, okay?
[38:31.000 --> 38:35.000]  They admit this is the plan and once they get the grid in
[38:35.000 --> 38:38.000]  they're going to up the soft kill and really start killing everybody.
[38:38.000 --> 38:41.000]  So if you want to die young to cancer or die young to Alzheimer's
[38:41.000 --> 38:44.000]  or have a bunch of autistic kids, don't listen to me.
[38:44.000 --> 38:49.000]  Now Eric Mankow Muller in his own right has exposed a lot of this over the years as well.
[38:49.000 --> 38:51.000]  So he's just tooting my horn when he gives us credit.
[38:51.000 --> 38:55.000]  He's one of the other hosts that has been willing to talk about a lot of these issues
[38:55.000 --> 38:59.000]  and discuss it and he's somebody that I think knows more celebrities than anybody else out there
[38:59.000 --> 39:02.000]  because he's been syndicated all over the country and been out in California
[39:02.000 --> 39:05.000]  when his career first launched to be one of the top shows in the country
[39:05.000 --> 39:07.000]  even rivaling Howard Stern.
[39:07.000 --> 39:08.000]  So he joins us now.
[39:08.000 --> 39:11.000]  Mankow always great to have you here with us my friend.
[39:11.000 --> 39:13.000]  Really sad news about Prince.
[39:13.000 --> 39:15.000]  Alex, can you hear me?
[39:15.000 --> 39:16.000]  Yes, sir.
[39:16.000 --> 39:19.000]  Okay, I'm walking through the streets of Chicago right now, my brother.
[39:19.000 --> 39:24.000]  I did replay where you talked about the blimps on my show and I laughed at you and I mocked you
[39:24.000 --> 39:27.000]  and I can't apologize enough.
[39:27.000 --> 39:29.000]  I was wrong about so much.
[39:29.000 --> 39:33.000]  Look, you're so cutting edge, you're so ahead of time
[39:33.000 --> 39:41.000]  and the stuff you say that sounds crazy today in five, ten years everybody's going to go,
[39:41.000 --> 39:43.000]  yeah, that's right.
[39:43.000 --> 39:45.000]  It becomes common knowledge.
[39:45.000 --> 39:48.000]  But you release these things and it's the truth.
[39:48.000 --> 39:49.000]  It's just amazing.
[39:49.000 --> 39:51.000]  I have a lot to tell you today.
[39:51.000 --> 39:53.000]  First of all, let me just go through a few quick things.
[39:53.000 --> 39:55.000]  I think Zika's setting us up for something.
[39:55.000 --> 39:57.000]  They're creating a lot of fear with Zika.
[39:57.000 --> 39:59.000]  I know you'll cover it on your show.
[39:59.000 --> 40:07.000]  I believe getting us ready for voterless elections and they'll try out Zika to take our attention away from our freedoms being robbed.
[40:07.000 --> 40:13.000]  I went to see a journey show and Robert Fleischman, who wrote Wheel in the Sky, he's the original lead singer,
[40:13.000 --> 40:18.000]  is absolutely a huge fan of yours and told me some interesting stuff.
[40:18.000 --> 40:21.000]  Wanted me to reveal the hologram universe we're living in.
[40:21.000 --> 40:23.000]  We don't have time for that now.
[40:23.000 --> 40:28.000]  But my big surprise for you has been ruined.
[40:28.000 --> 40:30.000]  How is that?
[40:30.000 --> 40:35.000]  Well, I told you about Billy, the lead singer of the Smashing Pumpkins and I think he's one of the people that's dialed in.
[40:35.000 --> 40:42.000]  He's seen behind the curtain and I'm talking stuff like, well, kind of like what you would see.
[40:42.000 --> 40:46.000]  I imagine the way it's been described to me like Kubrick's eyes wide shut.
[40:46.000 --> 40:49.000]  Prince also talking about some of these parties.
[40:49.000 --> 40:54.000]  You call it the Illuminati, you call it the Secret Society, the Satanic Blood stuff.
[40:54.000 --> 41:01.000]  People wonder why Prince dropped out and I believe it's because he was frightened of these entities,
[41:01.000 --> 41:04.000]  these things like Beyonce and Jay-Z and all the others.
[41:04.000 --> 41:10.000]  Some people are not willing to sell their soul and I think Prince began to shy away from that.
[41:10.000 --> 41:15.000]  Two years ago, maybe three years ago, Prince came and wanted to see me and wanted to see my studio.
[41:15.000 --> 41:18.000]  We did not have an extensive conversation.
[41:18.000 --> 41:21.000]  He did talk a lot to the girls, beautiful women around me.
[41:21.000 --> 41:22.000]  He did talk a lot to the girls.
[41:22.000 --> 41:24.000]  He did eat food off our craft services table.
[41:24.000 --> 41:26.000]  People had brought in food for us.
[41:26.000 --> 41:27.000]  I was shocked.
[41:27.000 --> 41:29.000]  He kind of hung out and talked to everybody with me.
[41:29.000 --> 41:33.000]  It was pretty much he looked around the studio, looked at my equipment, was sizing me up.
[41:33.000 --> 41:35.000]  I didn't know if he wanted to do a TV show with me.
[41:35.000 --> 41:39.000]  I didn't know what it was about.
[41:39.000 --> 41:44.000]  I spoke with him about getting him on your show and he said he would do your show.
[41:44.000 --> 41:47.000]  What we talked about and what he was fascinated with and he said,
[41:47.000 --> 41:53.000]  you and Alex Jones are the only ones to talk about it is the chemtrails,
[41:53.000 --> 41:58.000]  the loss of freedoms through music and everything else.
[41:58.000 --> 42:03.000]  He told me that he believed that everything was going to go digital.
[42:03.000 --> 42:09.000]  Music, everything so that if you irritated the people in control,
[42:09.000 --> 42:11.000]  they just delete you with a push of a button.
[42:11.000 --> 42:14.000]  I remember when you said you talked to Prince and he was a listener
[42:14.000 --> 42:16.000]  and I'm like, well, I think we tried to reach out to him
[42:16.000 --> 42:19.000]  and that guy's got so many people around him, hard to get to.
[42:19.000 --> 42:22.000]  These guys need to speak out before their untimely deaths.
[42:22.000 --> 42:24.000]  I tell you, it's very, very sad.
[42:24.000 --> 42:29.000]  But notice he's getting an autopsy, but the Supreme Court Justice, Anton Scalia isn't.
[42:29.000 --> 42:31.000]  And now we've got Chelsea Clinton video.
[42:31.000 --> 42:34.000]  We're going to play in a moment, man, Cal, who says that now he's out of the way.
[42:34.000 --> 42:36.000]  They can get our guns.
[42:36.000 --> 42:38.000]  Alex, I have a lot.
[42:38.000 --> 42:41.000]  I want to say something and I've been talking about this for years.
[42:41.000 --> 42:45.000]  My friend Andrew Breitbart and I, and you were to be part of that show.
[42:45.000 --> 42:47.000]  As you remember, in fact, we recorded a segment for Fox.
[42:47.000 --> 42:49.000]  Andrew Breitbart was going to do a segment.
[42:49.000 --> 42:53.000]  I'm talking Breitbart and all these other things that he started.
[42:53.000 --> 42:57.000]  You know, the Ariana Huffington's all, all these other people that he puffed up on the Internet.
[42:57.000 --> 43:01.000]  And you know, you would, you would watch Glenn Beck and all he was doing was reading Breitbart.
[43:01.000 --> 43:05.000]  But Breitbart and I were working on a TV show and he was going to do a thing on Fox News channel.
[43:05.000 --> 43:10.000]  He was going to do a segment called Future News and he told me that he had video that would bring down Obama, blah, blah, blah.
[43:10.000 --> 43:16.000]  Hours before he was going to release it on my show and nationwide worldwide, he was found dead.
[43:16.000 --> 43:18.000]  And they announced it immediately.
[43:18.000 --> 43:21.000]  Alex, I've been doing this since 1984, 85.
[43:21.000 --> 43:23.000]  Okay, I've been doing this for a while. I've never seen anything like it.
[43:23.000 --> 43:27.000]  Michael Jackson, whoever, you know, Amy Winehouse.
[43:27.000 --> 43:30.000]  Don't jump to conclusions. We don't know who's drugs.
[43:30.000 --> 43:36.000]  Wait a minute, what? I've never seen anything like it when Andrew Breitbart died.
[43:36.000 --> 43:38.000]  They said, uh, dead of natural causes.
[43:38.000 --> 43:42.000]  Within 30 minutes of him being announced that he was dead, they said natural causes.
[43:42.000 --> 43:45.000]  And now with Scalia, they announced, hey, he's dead.
[43:45.000 --> 43:47.000]  Natural causes, no autopsy.
[43:47.000 --> 43:54.000]  Yeah, yeah, listen, listen. And then people like me and you demanded an autopsy of Andrew Breitbart and what happened?
[43:54.000 --> 43:59.000]  As the coroner was ready to give the notice of information, he was murdered.
[43:59.000 --> 44:06.000]  So I just find it interesting that as this artist prints, and I didn't love all of his music, I'm going to be honest with you, it's not really my genre.
[44:06.000 --> 44:09.000]  But 57 years old, he's talking about chemtrails.
[44:09.000 --> 44:16.000]  He's talking about how they're manipulating our water, how they're turning us into weaklings, how they're numbing us, how they're dumbing us down, how they're turning us into sheeple.
[44:16.000 --> 44:25.000]  Isn't it interesting that as he comes public, as he shows up on my studio and talks to me and mentions, he gets a lot of his information from Alex Jones, as all of this is happening, he's dead.
[44:25.000 --> 44:26.000]  Wow.
[44:26.000 --> 44:30.000]  Some people are telling me they think he was murdered. I don't know.
[44:30.000 --> 44:33.000]  Well, I don't know how much of this I can get into.
[44:33.000 --> 44:40.000]  And why don't you talk about what Billy said on your show, his memories all blur what he's told me probably.
[44:40.000 --> 44:50.000]  My big surprise was I believed I was going to get a press came on my show, very quiet, very diminutive, a very intelligent guy, very smart.
[44:50.000 --> 44:54.000]  You know, these guys, the image is created, you understand.
[44:54.000 --> 44:57.000]  I mean, I also interviewed Kurt Cobain and, you know, he was an artist.
[44:57.000 --> 44:58.000]  He was tortured.
[44:58.000 --> 44:59.000]  He was all this.
[44:59.000 --> 45:00.000]  It was all by design.
[45:00.000 --> 45:01.000]  It was an act.
[45:01.000 --> 45:03.000]  It was an act.
[45:03.000 --> 45:05.000]  He wanted to sell records.
[45:05.000 --> 45:08.000]  He created that image to sell records, that image of not caring.
[45:08.000 --> 45:10.000]  You know, Prince, it was an act.
[45:10.000 --> 45:11.000]  It was an act.
[45:11.000 --> 45:16.000]  He borrowed it from James Brown and Little Richard and others, but a great artist.
[45:16.000 --> 45:19.000]  What particular do you want to talk about what Billy said?
[45:19.000 --> 45:22.000]  Well, and the problem is stuff all mixes together.
[45:22.000 --> 45:23.000]  What's in confidence?
[45:23.000 --> 45:24.000]  What's private?
[45:24.000 --> 45:26.000]  And then I confirmed a lot of stuff he told me from other high level people.
[45:26.000 --> 45:33.000]  And it's just crazy how the elite really want to have top rock stars and rappers and other people into their meetings.
[45:33.000 --> 45:39.000]  And this type of stuff, you know, I've been invited not just to speak at Oxford and Cambridge.
[45:39.000 --> 45:42.000]  And then I was told, oh, you've been offered that.
[45:42.000 --> 45:46.000]  That's really the cover for this by a high level person in Hollywood.
[45:46.000 --> 45:47.000]  And then sure enough, it did happen.
[45:47.000 --> 45:51.000]  I mean, I've been invited to basically go over and be it.
[45:51.000 --> 45:58.000]  I mean, eyes wide shut type stuff with real elites, you know, and the listeners are hearing this and they're going, oh, yeah, really, no folks.
[45:58.000 --> 45:59.000]  This is real.
[45:59.000 --> 46:06.000]  That's why Vivian Kubrick, who was the protege of Stanley Kubrick, gave me the only interview she's given in 15 years about all this.
[46:06.000 --> 46:09.000]  And she knew the stuff I've been through.
[46:09.000 --> 46:11.000]  It was, Leanne was there.
[46:11.000 --> 46:15.000]  We were at dinner and she was literally got down on her knees in front of me.
[46:15.000 --> 46:16.000]  And I was like, what are you doing?
[46:16.000 --> 46:19.000]  She goes, no, listen, she started telling me all the stuff that no one would know.
[46:19.000 --> 46:21.000]  And I can't even get into it all.
[46:21.000 --> 46:24.000]  I just, I just wish the public knew what was really going on.
[46:24.000 --> 46:27.000]  Alex, Alex, I want to tell you some eyes wide shut, brother.
[46:27.000 --> 46:29.000]  That movie reveals a lot.
[46:29.000 --> 46:31.000]  Eyes wide shut by Kubrick.
[46:31.000 --> 46:33.000]  It's an awful movie, but these parties do happen.
[46:33.000 --> 46:37.000]  Prince talked about these parties, not just with me, but elsewhere.
[46:37.000 --> 46:38.000]  And are you willing?
[46:38.000 --> 46:42.000]  And, you know, look, there's a great drug that my listeners have and your listeners have.
[46:42.000 --> 46:44.000]  And Alex, hell, you had it and I had it.
[46:44.000 --> 46:49.000]  And that drug is if we only had fame or we only had money or we only had this or that, we'd be happy.
[46:49.000 --> 46:52.000]  And I know, Alex, I know the battles that you've had in your life.
[46:52.000 --> 46:58.000]  And, and, but this, this, this drug, we have sold people this, this idea that, that fame will cure them.
[46:58.000 --> 47:02.000]  And so I understand that people are literally willing to sell their soul for it.
[47:02.000 --> 47:03.000]  You and I haven't.
[47:03.000 --> 47:05.000]  And I want to tell you that Billy hasn't.
[47:05.000 --> 47:06.000]  There's a reason.
[47:06.000 --> 47:14.000]  How about this guy that Phil stadiums and sells millions and millions of recordings and yet they, they press lesser stars than Billy?
[47:14.000 --> 47:16.000]  Why didn't he promote it because he wouldn't sell out?
[47:16.000 --> 47:18.000]  Why did Prince disappear because he wouldn't sell?
[47:18.000 --> 47:21.000]  He wouldn't, he wouldn't give them his master tapes.
[47:21.000 --> 47:22.000]  Right.
[47:22.000 --> 47:26.000]  What about, what about me and you where, where we do these shows?
[47:26.000 --> 47:28.000]  I'm, I'm reaching, you know, two, three million people.
[47:28.000 --> 47:29.000]  You're probably reaching more than that.
[47:29.000 --> 47:35.000]  And yet all we hear about is Anderson Cooper and Rachel Maddow who has, you know, a couple hundred thousand people.
[47:35.000 --> 47:37.000]  It's all part of the saw.
[47:37.000 --> 47:40.000]  But, but I mean, getting back to that, we're not willing to sell out to the agenda.
[47:40.000 --> 47:43.000]  And if you don't do the agenda, you don't get promoted.
[47:43.000 --> 47:46.000]  If you don't have, if you don't, yeah, I'm sorry.
[47:46.000 --> 47:47.000]  Go ahead, sir.
[47:47.000 --> 47:48.000]  Well, I don't even want to.
[47:48.000 --> 47:50.000]  Speaking of Breitbart.
[47:50.000 --> 47:54.000]  I mean, folks at that level now go around in disguises and things.
[47:54.000 --> 47:59.000]  People don't know all this just so they're not known and seen in public because they're getting followed around 24 seven.
[47:59.000 --> 48:01.000]  And I don't want to get up here and whine about the stuff to people.
[48:01.000 --> 48:04.000]  They just don't know how real it is till they've experienced it.
[48:04.000 --> 48:08.000]  And I know the circles you've been in, you've experienced even more of this than I have.
[48:08.000 --> 48:13.000]  But I was talking to just even Mark Dice when they were getting ready to give him a national TV show.
[48:13.000 --> 48:17.000]  He's awesome with, you know, some of the folks from Motley Crude.
[48:17.000 --> 48:22.000]  He's in the meeting and the head producer, not with Motley Crude, but with this big TV network goes, listen.
[48:22.000 --> 48:24.000]  Mark, what's wrong with the devil?
[48:24.000 --> 48:25.000]  What's wrong with Satan?
[48:25.000 --> 48:30.000]  And starts praising Lucifer and asking him to join with Lucifer.
[48:30.000 --> 48:34.000]  And the guy was in a religious experience trying to sell him on it.
[48:34.000 --> 48:35.000]  And people just don't understand.
[48:35.000 --> 48:38.000]  They don't know what happens next level.
[48:38.000 --> 48:44.000]  And they've got all these shows where Lucifer is this sweet guy out in LA, you know, on TV now and he loves everybody.
[48:44.000 --> 48:48.000]  I mean, these people are really trying to bring in this satanic takeover.
[48:48.000 --> 48:57.000]  And you look at Lady Gaga has to have bodyguards around her at night because she's terrorized by demons and ghosts and screaming and yelling and flopping around.
[48:57.000 --> 49:04.000]  Kesha, all these people have become just conduits of interdimensional evil, whatever you want to call it.
[49:04.000 --> 49:05.000]  It is insane.
[49:05.000 --> 49:12.000]  And every Super Bowl and every big award show is turned into some type of huge Babylonian witchcraft event.
[49:12.000 --> 49:14.000]  What do you think this is all about, man?
[49:14.000 --> 49:16.000]  Alex, I know exactly what it's about.
[49:16.000 --> 49:17.000]  I want to tell you something, brother.
[49:17.000 --> 49:27.000]  You say interdimensional and I had on John Anderson, the brilliant voice of yes, who has the ability, he says, to see into the fourth dimension.
[49:27.000 --> 49:32.000]  And look, you know, whatever you want to, you can go the science route.
[49:32.000 --> 49:35.000]  You can go the biblical route.
[49:35.000 --> 49:43.000]  And as we touch that quickly, I do want to say that Chris Carter did confirm that the character Joel was based on you in the last incarnation.
[49:43.000 --> 49:44.000]  I thought it was wonderful.
[49:44.000 --> 49:46.000]  He told me that that was you.
[49:46.000 --> 49:47.000]  He told me that on the radio.
[49:47.000 --> 49:48.000]  So I have tape.
[49:48.000 --> 49:49.000]  I have proof.
[49:49.000 --> 49:50.000]  No, I mean, it's not a big deal.
[49:50.000 --> 49:55.000]  I mean, he said it in a bunch of newspaper articles and the media said I was running a hunt.
[49:55.000 --> 49:56.000]  Let's get back to this.
[49:56.000 --> 49:58.000]  Why do all these artists go broke beyond garage?
[49:58.000 --> 50:00.000]  Why are they up all the time?
[50:00.000 --> 50:02.000]  Why do they why do they not have mirrors?
[50:02.000 --> 50:12.000]  If you talk to anyone who does this interdimensional demonic stuff, they conjure faces and they are given their marching orders and speak to people or creatures, whatever it is, goat headed figures.
[50:12.000 --> 50:13.000]  And I've heard all kinds of stuff.
[50:13.000 --> 50:14.000]  That's what it is.
[50:14.000 --> 50:15.000]  Skip the line.
[50:15.000 --> 50:17.000]  And they don't have mirrors.
[50:17.000 --> 50:18.000]  They can't sleep.
[50:18.000 --> 50:19.000]  They're terrified now.
[50:19.000 --> 50:23.000]  Think about how much fame would you like?
[50:23.000 --> 50:24.000]  Not you, Alex.
[50:24.000 --> 50:25.000]  Just everybody.
[50:25.000 --> 50:26.000]  How much fame?
[50:26.000 --> 50:27.000]  How much money would you like?
[50:27.000 --> 50:31.000]  Would you want to be Prince who was terrified, who was locked away in Paisley Park?
[50:31.000 --> 50:32.000]  In Minnesota?
[50:32.000 --> 50:35.000]  He couldn't get away from those people.
[50:35.000 --> 50:37.000]  Would you like to be Michael Jackson?
[50:37.000 --> 50:39.000]  Would you like to be Elvis?
[50:39.000 --> 50:42.000]  You know, when these people get everything, what do they want to do?
[50:42.000 --> 50:43.000]  They want to get away from it.
[50:43.000 --> 50:44.000]  But this is what they're selling us.
[50:44.000 --> 50:47.000]  This is every TV show aimed at our kids, Alex.
[50:47.000 --> 50:48.000]  This is every message.
[50:48.000 --> 50:49.000]  I know.
[50:49.000 --> 50:51.000]  Look, I've had him point blank since I was about 13.
[50:51.000 --> 50:55.000]  I've had these people try to recruit me and it is just they are so unhappy.
[50:55.000 --> 50:58.000]  Why on earth would I ever want to work with these people?
[50:58.000 --> 51:00.000]  But Alex, look, if you want wealth and you want fame.
[51:00.000 --> 51:04.000]  And you haven't had a background of any kind of anything.
[51:04.000 --> 51:08.000]  You know, I love these parents today in 2016 that say, well, I'm not going to pick religion.
[51:08.000 --> 51:09.000]  I'll let the kids pick.
[51:09.000 --> 51:10.000]  Oh, they're going to pick.
[51:10.000 --> 51:11.000]  They're going to pick.
[51:11.000 --> 51:13.000]  You're letting the system pick.
[51:13.000 --> 51:15.000]  Let me bring this up back to Prince.
[51:15.000 --> 51:17.000]  So you're saying this wasn't even too long ago.
[51:17.000 --> 51:19.000]  He wanted to reach out and come on my show.
[51:19.000 --> 51:21.000]  It was two, three years ago.
[51:21.000 --> 51:23.000]  Everybody wants to hear tidbits of this specifically.
[51:23.000 --> 51:25.000]  What did he say about the New World Order?
[51:25.000 --> 51:27.000]  What did he say about different issues?
[51:27.000 --> 51:29.000]  I had a TV show off Michigan Avenue.
[51:29.000 --> 51:39.000]  He came in, he put his finger kind of fingers together like he was praying and put his fingers on his chin and looked at my equipment, looked at the ceiling, looked, looked me up and down, looked around.
[51:39.000 --> 51:41.000]  This went on for quite some time.
[51:41.000 --> 51:44.000]  When we finally had some time, he was very quiet.
[51:44.000 --> 51:48.000]  And he said that, you know, you and Alex Jones are the only ones that are telling it like it is.
[51:48.000 --> 51:58.000]  And he did talk about some parties that he had been to that were, you know, like you said, you can say, say, can if you can say Babylonian, however, however you want to label it.
[51:58.000 --> 52:01.000]  And I've been to these parties we've talked about on this show before.
[52:01.000 --> 52:04.000]  Full-on Satanic stuff, man.
[52:04.000 --> 52:06.000]  And, you know, it's uncloaking.
[52:06.000 --> 52:09.000]  It's not even, I mean, I'm acting like this is some big story.
[52:09.000 --> 52:11.000]  Does anybody doubt it?
[52:11.000 --> 52:12.000]  Evil is uncloaking.
[52:12.000 --> 52:13.000]  Devil's advocate.
[52:13.000 --> 52:15.000]  We need a good, you know, that used to be something.
[52:15.000 --> 52:16.000]  Devil's advocate.
[52:16.000 --> 52:17.000]  Evil doesn't need an advocate.
[52:17.000 --> 52:19.000]  Everybody's the devil's advocate now.
[52:19.000 --> 52:21.000]  Somebody needs to be an advocate for good.
[52:21.000 --> 52:28.000]  Okay, so, so, you know, he wanted to talk, I had done a piece on the history channel about fluoride he had seen.
[52:28.000 --> 52:30.000]  He wanted to talk about, you and I have talked about this a lot.
[52:30.000 --> 52:32.000]  The poison in the water that's dumping us down.
[52:32.000 --> 52:34.000]  Folks, get a water filter.
[52:34.000 --> 52:36.000]  Prince was a big believer in that.
[52:36.000 --> 52:40.000]  And even that, it was seeping through your skin through showers, he felt.
[52:40.000 --> 52:41.000]  Of course it is.
[52:41.000 --> 52:43.000]  It was all about neutering us.
[52:43.000 --> 52:44.000]  It was all about dumping us down.
[52:44.000 --> 52:45.000]  It's all by design.
[52:45.000 --> 52:46.000]  Why don't we get upset?
[52:46.000 --> 52:49.000]  Prince talked about seeing these chemtrails.
[52:49.000 --> 52:53.000]  I've seen it in Chicago and I've been laughed at and mocked.
[52:53.000 --> 52:56.000]  By the way, let me play a clip because, I mean, mainstream media will say we made this up.
[52:56.000 --> 52:59.000]  Let's play him on Tabith Smiley a few years ago, five years ago.
[52:59.000 --> 53:04.000]  Prince, rare interview, talking about the geoengineering going on chemtrails.
[53:04.000 --> 53:05.000]  Here it is.
[53:05.000 --> 53:08.000]  What he said affects all of us.
[53:08.000 --> 53:18.000]  He said something that really hit home about this phenomena of chemtrails.
[53:18.000 --> 53:26.000]  And, you know, when I was a kid, I used to see these trails in the sky all the time.
[53:26.000 --> 53:28.000]  And so that's cool.
[53:28.000 --> 53:30.000]  A jet just went over.
[53:30.000 --> 53:33.000]  And then you started to see a whole bunch of them.
[53:33.000 --> 53:38.000]  And next thing you know, everybody in your neighborhood was fighting and arguing and you didn't know why.
[53:38.000 --> 53:39.000]  Okay.
[53:39.000 --> 53:41.000]  And you really didn't know why.
[53:41.000 --> 53:44.000]  I mean, everybody was fighting.
[53:44.000 --> 53:51.000]  So he started riffing about the chemtrails.
[53:51.000 --> 53:58.000]  And he started to say things that hit home so hard.
[53:58.000 --> 54:07.000]  And I would recommend that everybody try to get what he said online or wherever.
[54:07.000 --> 54:09.000]  And that's Prince talking about Dick Gregory.
[54:09.000 --> 54:13.000]  He's been a guest many times on the show talking about geoengineering, social engineering,
[54:13.000 --> 54:14.000]  and the water.
[54:14.000 --> 54:17.000]  Hey, Alex, I did remember something.
[54:17.000 --> 54:23.000]  Now, listening to that, something I remember that he said, and I've heard this a lot and I've said it to you.
[54:23.000 --> 54:30.000]  And maybe I shouldn't put this out there, but brother, I got to be very careful here for both of us.
[54:30.000 --> 54:35.000]  But he did give me a warning for you and for me.
[54:35.000 --> 54:39.000]  He felt that you and I should be very, very careful.
[54:39.000 --> 54:42.000]  I remember you said you talked to Prince, but you couldn't tell me what.
[54:42.000 --> 54:44.000]  And we should try to get him on, but it never happened, I guess.
[54:44.000 --> 54:48.000]  So I guess he came over to your show, but didn't get into all this.
[54:48.000 --> 54:52.000]  But you're messing with dangerous stuff here, brother.
[54:52.000 --> 54:59.000]  And remember this, as in the times of Noah, and it's snowballing now.
[54:59.000 --> 55:00.000]  It's gathering.
[55:00.000 --> 55:01.000]  It's gathering.
[55:01.000 --> 55:02.000]  It's rolling.
[55:02.000 --> 55:03.000]  It's getting worse, isn't it?
[55:03.000 --> 55:07.000]  Did you hear the song Merle Haggard did just a few years ago called What I Hate?
[55:07.000 --> 55:10.000]  And it's all about chemtrails?
[55:10.000 --> 55:11.000]  Yeah, but of course, if you and I talk about that.
[55:11.000 --> 55:18.000]  I mean, I can tell you in, I saw it in San Francisco and I've seen it in, excuse me, in Chicago numerous times.
[55:18.000 --> 55:19.000]  The planes crisscross.
[55:19.000 --> 55:21.000]  The cars get all sticky.
[55:21.000 --> 55:23.000]  I've had it analyzed.
[55:23.000 --> 55:25.000]  I mean, we know what it is.
[55:25.000 --> 55:26.000]  They're dropping chemicals.
[55:26.000 --> 55:29.000]  And it's, I mean, look at Chicago right now.
[55:29.000 --> 55:30.000]  Look at the taxes.
[55:30.000 --> 55:31.000]  Look at the murder, man.
[55:31.000 --> 55:36.000]  Do you know that where I live, Cook County is the number one place in North America people want to leave?
[55:36.000 --> 55:39.000]  You already had the highest crime rate in the world.
[55:39.000 --> 55:40.000]  It doubled in the last year.
[55:40.000 --> 55:41.000]  Yeah.
[55:41.000 --> 55:42.000]  No, everybody, everybody's docile.
[55:42.000 --> 55:43.000]  Why?
[55:43.000 --> 55:50.000]  Because when it gets hot and people start getting angry about the state of things, they fly over and drop these chemicals on us.
[55:50.000 --> 55:53.000]  And then everybody walks around for the next week or two.
[55:53.000 --> 55:54.000]  I've seen it.
[55:54.000 --> 55:55.000]  It's just what Prince would say.
[55:55.000 --> 56:01.000]  And then everybody walks around like they're, you know, they're, they're, they're walkers from the walking dead.
[56:01.000 --> 56:13.000]  Yeah. The Sunshine Project about 16 years ago got a declassified document on the Marines preparation with choppers to gas holes.
[56:13.000 --> 56:14.000]  Yeah.
[56:14.000 --> 56:22.000]  We have, we have more estrogen in our, in our water in Chicago than they have in, in, you know, pills for women in birth control pills.
[56:22.000 --> 56:25.000]  And I had on the person in charge of this from the city.
[56:25.000 --> 56:26.000]  And I said, what's that?
[56:26.000 --> 56:28.000]  Oh, women are flushing their pills.
[56:28.000 --> 56:29.000]  What?
[56:29.000 --> 56:31.000]  Yeah. Well, when women don't use their pills, they flush them, you know.
[56:31.000 --> 56:36.000]  But then they did a study, even AP admitted it's much higher than even what runoff could cause.
[56:36.000 --> 56:40.000]  And they found it's a base prozac chemical, a base estrogen chemical.
[56:40.000 --> 56:44.000]  It's like an industrial level in the White House science art midst.
[56:44.000 --> 56:47.000]  Well, Prince is gone, but there is a global awakening taking place.
[56:47.000 --> 56:54.000]  And I hope to come on next week for a full hour and take calls, get into the election and everything else that's coming up mancow.com.
[56:54.000 --> 56:58.000]  I guess we've got to work harder and actually try to get these celebrities on the show.
[56:58.000 --> 57:04.000]  Cause my, my first thought when I heard his death was I've let you down because I, I was working behind the scenes to get them on.
[57:04.000 --> 57:05.000]  And I promised you that.
[57:05.000 --> 57:06.000]  Hey, what about Jeff Bridges?
[57:06.000 --> 57:09.000]  I wish I wouldn't have missed the call that, that night you guys were together.
[57:09.000 --> 57:11.000]  I need to try to, I haven't even tried to get him on, but.
[57:11.000 --> 57:14.000]  Well, I'm going to be, I'm going to be seeing Bo Bridges here shortly.
[57:14.000 --> 57:17.000]  In fact, I think I may be seeing him tomorrow night.
[57:17.000 --> 57:20.000]  Bo, Bo is a, is a family friend.
[57:20.000 --> 57:25.000]  And I'll work on, I'll work on that as well.
[57:25.000 --> 57:27.000]  Look, I, you know, these obviously, brother,
[57:27.000 --> 57:32.000]  how about, how about we both fly, get on a plane, let's fly out, interview Bridges.
[57:32.000 --> 57:34.000]  And let's do Kurt Russell while we're at it.
[57:34.000 --> 57:39.000]  And Chris Carter, let's just line them all up like Big Lebowski and knock those pins down.
[57:39.000 --> 57:40.000]  Let's do it.
[57:40.000 --> 57:44.000]  And I've got another, I've got another, I've got another biggie for you soon.
[57:44.000 --> 57:45.000]  I'm working on it, but.
[57:45.000 --> 57:48.000]  I know you, but then you, but then tell us now.
[57:48.000 --> 57:50.000]  Well, no, I know what you're saying.
[57:50.000 --> 57:52.000]  No, but brother, these are, look at, look at Gary Oldman.
[57:52.000 --> 57:56.000]  Look at some of these people, the minute you come out and say, yeah, I mean,
[57:56.000 --> 57:59.000]  I, when you see behind the curtain, if you tell people,
[57:59.000 --> 58:01.000]  half of them are going to mock you and the other half are going to try to.
[58:01.000 --> 58:04.000]  Yeah, but I think that, I think that's changing, man.
[58:04.000 --> 58:06.000]  Oh, Merle Haggard.
[58:06.000 --> 58:10.000]  Looking out and seeing Kim Trails in a clear blue sky today.
[58:10.000 --> 58:12.000]  That's right. Merle Haggard was awake, Prince was awake.
[58:12.000 --> 58:13.000]  Everybody else seems to be awake.
[58:13.000 --> 58:15.000]  David Bowie, you knew him pretty good, 30 seconds.
[58:15.000 --> 58:17.000]  Any 10 bits on David Bowie?
[58:17.000 --> 58:24.000]  Bowie, I believe Bowie got illegal fetal cells injected into his face.
[58:24.000 --> 58:26.000]  He did not seem to age.
[58:26.000 --> 58:27.000]  I believe he was going to Europe.
[58:27.000 --> 58:29.000]  I believe it's the same thing that the Queen of England does with.
[58:29.000 --> 58:30.000]  You said this before he died.
[58:30.000 --> 58:32.000]  You said he looked like a vampire.
[58:32.000 --> 58:33.000]  He looked so good.
[58:33.000 --> 58:34.000]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[58:34.000 --> 58:35.000]  But I mean the same thing with the Queen of England.
[58:35.000 --> 58:38.000]  These people are getting blood transfusions, genetic manipulation.
[58:38.000 --> 58:39.000]  And, and they're doing.
[58:39.000 --> 58:40.000]  Hold on, we're going to break.
[58:40.000 --> 58:41.000]  You do five more.
[58:41.000 --> 58:42.000]  Mancow, stay with us.
[58:42.000 --> 58:43.000]  With fetals.
[58:43.000 --> 58:44.000]  Okay.
[58:44.000 --> 58:45.000]  What I love.

[58:48.000 --> 58:52.000]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.

[02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:48.000]  Have a great day.
[02:41:48.000 --> 02:42:14.000]  Have a great day.

[02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:24.000]  Have a great day.
[02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:50.000]  Have a great day.

[02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:38.000]  Have a great day.
[02:48:38.000 --> 02:49:04.000]  Have a great day.
[02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:30.000]  Have a great day.
[02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:56.000]  Have a great day.
[02:49:56.000 --> 02:50:22.000]  Have a great day.
[02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:48.000]  Have a great day.
[02:50:48.000 --> 02:51:16.000]  Have a great day.
[02:51:16.000 --> 02:51:42.000]  Have a great day.
[02:51:42.000 --> 02:52:08.000]  Have a great day.

[02:58:38.000 --> 02:59:04.000]  Have a great day.
[02:59:04.000 --> 02:59:30.000]  Have a great day.
[02:59:30.000 --> 02:59:56.000]  Have a great day.
[02:59:56.000 --> 03:00:22.000]  Have a great day.
[03:00:22.000 --> 03:00:48.000]  Have a great day.
[03:00:48.000 --> 03:01:14.000]  Have a great day.
[03:01:14.000 --> 03:01:40.000]  Have a great day.
[03:01:40.000 --> 03:02:06.000]  Have a great day.
[03:02:06.000 --> 03:02:32.000]  Have a great day.
[03:02:32.000 --> 03:02:58.000]  Have a great day.
[03:02:58.000 --> 03:03:24.000]  Have a great day.
[03:03:24.000 --> 03:03:50.000]  Have a great day.
[03:03:50.000 --> 03:04:16.000]  Have a great day.
[03:04:16.000 --> 03:04:42.000]  Have a great day.
[03:04:42.000 --> 03:05:08.000]  Have a great day.
[03:05:08.000 --> 03:05:34.000]  Have a great day.
[03:05:38.000 --> 03:05:58.000]  Have a great day.
[03:06:08.000 --> 03:06:34.000]  Have a great day.
[03:06:34.000 --> 03:06:58.000]  Have a great day.
[03:06:58.000 --> 03:07:24.000]  Have a great day.
[03:07:24.000 --> 03:07:50.000]  Have a great day.
[03:07:50.000 --> 03:08:16.000]  Have a great day.
[03:08:16.000 --> 03:08:44.000]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[03:08:44.000 --> 03:08:46.000]  Call us walking corpses.
[03:08:46.000 --> 03:08:48.000]  Unholy living dead.
[03:08:48.000 --> 03:08:50.000]  Crank it up.
[03:08:50.000 --> 03:09:02.000]  Unholy living dead.
[03:09:02.000 --> 03:09:04.000]  Those are risks we shouldn't be taking.
[03:09:04.000 --> 03:09:06.000]  That's why we don't.
[03:09:06.000 --> 03:09:14.000]  Ain't no mystery.
[03:09:14.000 --> 03:09:18.000]  I'm going to hand the baton to Anthony.
[03:09:18.000 --> 03:09:22.000]  You already heard about two minutes.
[03:09:22.000 --> 03:09:30.000]  Since we're getting into this, as Queen turns 90, report values British monarchy at 844-884 billion.
[03:09:30.000 --> 03:09:36.000]  As the Queen turns 90, report values British monarchy at 84 billion.
[03:09:36.000 --> 03:09:40.000]  I have trouble even saying a lie when it's not my lie.
[03:09:40.000 --> 03:09:42.000]  These people are worth trillions.
[03:09:42.000 --> 03:09:46.000]  And Obama is over there groveling to them right now.
[03:09:46.000 --> 03:09:50.000]  Happy belated birthday, Your Majesty.
[03:09:50.000 --> 03:09:58.000]  Obama lunches with the Queen as the storm over the British exit of the EU rages on.
[03:09:58.000 --> 03:10:14.000]  And Boris Johnson, who's a social liberal, but does point out the EU doesn't pay taxes, the bureaucrats don't, that it makes now 90-plus percent of UK laws.
[03:10:14.000 --> 03:10:22.000]  Boris Johnson suggests part Kenyan Obama may have an ancestral dislike of Britain because Kenya was a British empire holding.
[03:10:22.000 --> 03:10:28.000]  And I'll say this, it's kind of like the movie, Life of Brian, where they're saying, what have the Robins ever given us?
[03:10:28.000 --> 03:10:32.000]  Well, language and literature and mathematics and the aqueducts.
[03:10:32.000 --> 03:10:34.000]  Who cares about the aqueduct?
[03:10:34.000 --> 03:10:38.000]  But this modern British empire is dehumanizing people and enslaving folks.
[03:10:38.000 --> 03:10:40.000]  I have a problem, and it had problems too.
[03:10:40.000 --> 03:10:42.000]  I'm not defending the British empire.
[03:10:42.000 --> 03:10:44.000]  My God, we overthrew it.
[03:10:44.000 --> 03:10:50.000]  The point is, is that Kenya complaining about the British empire is really a joke continuing.
[03:10:50.000 --> 03:10:52.000]  They don't really complain, they've been asking the Brits back in.
[03:10:52.000 --> 03:10:58.000]  The mayor of London attacked the president for endorsing the UK's position in the EU.
[03:10:58.000 --> 03:11:02.000]  He's traveling to the UK.
[03:11:02.000 --> 03:11:08.000]  Obama is lobbying for them to stay inside the corrupt EU that's signing them on to all these European debts.
[03:11:08.000 --> 03:11:16.000]  This is colonialism, globalist corporate colonialism, so powerful that even the UK is going under colonialism.
[03:11:16.000 --> 03:11:18.000]  But the UK always was under colonialism.
[03:11:18.000 --> 03:11:22.000]  The Brits paid for it, did the fighting, did all of it.
[03:11:22.000 --> 03:11:28.000]  Lost millions per war sometime to build this global empire that was then handed over.
[03:11:28.000 --> 03:11:40.000]  So of course the Queen of England is all about staying in the EU with her Transylvanian husband, Prince Philip, who says black people aren't humans.
[03:11:40.000 --> 03:11:50.000]  And I'm really surprised that Prince Philip, one of the biggest racists on the planet, would even hang around with Obama.
[03:11:50.000 --> 03:11:53.000]  I mean, that guy is a famously flaming racist.
[03:11:53.000 --> 03:11:58.000]  He'll literally be on live BBC and go, all their blacks here, do they have any spears to throw?
[03:11:58.000 --> 03:12:00.000]  Oh, how do they screw in a light bulb?
[03:12:00.000 --> 03:12:02.000]  You know, I mean, I'm not going to say the other jokes.
[03:12:02.000 --> 03:12:04.000]  He said it on TV before.
[03:12:04.000 --> 03:12:09.000]  They're like, sponge it as quickly as they can.
[03:12:09.000 --> 03:12:11.000]  So that's what this is all about.
[03:12:11.000 --> 03:12:14.000]  That's all this fake liberalism is really all about.
[03:12:14.000 --> 03:12:21.000]  Obama to make historic Hiroshima visit at G7 summit to apologize for what happened in World War II.
[03:12:21.000 --> 03:12:27.000]  You mean how the Japanese were told they could have areas of the Pacific and then weren't told that.
[03:12:27.000 --> 03:12:35.000]  And then we stood down so they could attack and then they tried to unconditionally surrender for three weeks before Hiroshima and Nagasaki got A-bombs.
[03:12:35.000 --> 03:12:37.000]  What was it?
[03:12:37.000 --> 03:12:41.000]  Fat boy, little boy, what were those moms?
[03:12:41.000 --> 03:12:47.000]  But it's just all political stunts that are going on.
[03:12:47.000 --> 03:12:53.000]  Now, continuing here today, let's go now to the other studio.
[03:12:53.000 --> 03:12:54.000]  I'm in the war room.
[03:12:54.000 --> 03:12:55.000]  He's in the situation room.
[03:12:55.000 --> 03:13:01.000]  Anthony Gucciardi joins us to take over the helm and run the operation.
[03:13:01.000 --> 03:13:04.000]  Anthony, I tell you, it is quite a crazy world today.
[03:13:04.000 --> 03:13:08.000]  But isn't it wild how like everything we've been talking about forever is now coming out?
[03:13:08.000 --> 03:13:16.000]  It's a very surreal moment for me and every day gets crazier like a singularity of anti-New World Order awakening is happening.
[03:13:16.000 --> 03:13:18.000]  Anthony, what do you think is happening?
[03:13:18.000 --> 03:13:22.000]  It's true and you would think it feels good, but it doesn't because you don't want all of this to be true.
[03:13:22.000 --> 03:13:24.000]  You don't want it all to be happening.
[03:13:24.000 --> 03:13:29.000]  And it's kind of like, you know, I had a really bad migraine this morning, but I wanted to come in because there's so much stuff to cover.
[03:13:29.000 --> 03:13:38.000]  And before I was coming in, I had all this news and bigs came up and I said, hey, didn't you do a report on transgendered bathrooms on kids going in there and child safety?
[03:13:38.000 --> 03:13:40.000]  It's way worse than we even thought.
[03:13:40.000 --> 03:13:41.000]  Oh, I meant to play this.
[03:13:41.000 --> 03:13:42.000]  I meant to get into this.
[03:13:42.000 --> 03:13:43.000]  I'm going to play it here actually.
[03:13:43.000 --> 03:13:46.000]  So you're not going to want to miss it seriously.
[03:13:46.000 --> 03:13:47.000]  This is a good report.
[03:13:47.000 --> 03:13:49.000]  And he's going to come in and break it down.
[03:13:49.000 --> 03:13:50.000]  He found out.
[03:13:50.000 --> 03:13:51.000]  What's that?
[03:13:51.000 --> 03:13:53.000]  Hey, Mr. How you doing here, my bird?
[03:13:53.000 --> 03:13:55.000]  Can I change the whole for you, Mr. Gucciardi?
[03:13:55.000 --> 03:14:00.000]  You know, what's interesting?
[03:14:00.000 --> 03:14:02.000]  I heard Obamacare is free.
[03:14:02.000 --> 03:14:06.000]  I like socialism and the dictatorship of proletariat.
[03:14:06.000 --> 03:14:08.000]  I'm going to have your ass thrown to prison.
[03:14:08.000 --> 03:14:09.000]  And you know what?
[03:14:09.000 --> 03:14:12.000]  If the royalty says something, it's fine.
[03:14:12.000 --> 03:14:13.000]  It's not racist.
[03:14:13.000 --> 03:14:15.000]  But if you say anything, you're bad.
[03:14:15.000 --> 03:14:16.000]  That's just the rules.
[03:14:16.000 --> 03:14:21.000]  You know, I totally forgot about that whole deal because I meant to cover political correctness saying I didn't.
[03:14:21.000 --> 03:14:27.000]  You've got this former major league baseball player just sends out a tweet saying, man, you know, leave the bathrooms alone.
[03:14:27.000 --> 03:14:34.000]  And then he's fired because if they could make people be fired over saying we should have men's and women's bathrooms, all speech can be banned.
[03:14:34.000 --> 03:14:35.000]  They're just setting the precedent.
[03:14:35.000 --> 03:14:37.000]  They're moving forward.
[03:14:37.000 --> 03:14:38.000]  It's completely insane.
[03:14:38.000 --> 03:14:41.000]  Meanwhile, this UFC guy won this fight and screamed Allah Akbar.
[03:14:41.000 --> 03:14:42.000]  We're taking over.
[03:14:42.000 --> 03:14:43.000]  We're going to get you.
[03:14:43.000 --> 03:14:50.000]  Remember, you know, I remember watching a show like 10 years ago and you were talking about how they're going to let men with wigs in the bathrooms and stuff.
[03:14:50.000 --> 03:14:52.000]  And people are like, that's never going to happen.
[03:14:52.000 --> 03:14:53.000]  That's insane.
[03:14:53.000 --> 03:14:55.000]  You know, there's child safety laws and stuff.
[03:14:55.000 --> 03:14:56.000]  No, it's actually happening.
[03:14:56.000 --> 03:14:59.000]  And some of the stuff we're going to talk about is, but you know what the antidote is?
[03:14:59.000 --> 03:15:02.000]  It's the super ultra red, redneck, make America free again.
[03:15:02.000 --> 03:15:05.000]  Hats camouflage, royal red and royal blue.
[03:15:05.000 --> 03:15:07.000]  And then for war store.com.
[03:15:07.000 --> 03:15:08.000]  I mean, do I listen?
[03:15:08.000 --> 03:15:09.000]  I walk into it.
[03:15:09.000 --> 03:15:12.000]  I walk into a truck stop or I walk into a deer camp.
[03:15:12.000 --> 03:15:16.000]  I mean, with this big head, they really make hats big enough for me.
[03:15:16.000 --> 03:15:17.000]  These actually fit on me.
[03:15:17.000 --> 03:15:20.000]  I walk in and they literally understand that big daddy's arrived.
[03:15:20.000 --> 03:15:21.000]  Oh, they know.
[03:15:21.000 --> 03:15:23.000]  They know that they've arrived.
[03:15:23.000 --> 03:15:24.000]  They know that they've arrived.
[03:15:24.000 --> 03:15:25.000]  And they see that.
[03:15:27.000 --> 03:15:28.000]  Put it on backwards.
[03:15:28.000 --> 03:15:29.000]  Yeah.
[03:15:29.000 --> 03:15:30.000]  Look at that.
[03:15:30.000 --> 03:15:31.000]  I love this car.
[03:15:31.000 --> 03:15:32.000]  Anthony.
[03:15:32.000 --> 03:15:33.000]  Anthony.
[03:15:33.000 --> 03:15:35.000]  What's wrong with Obama?
[03:15:35.000 --> 03:15:36.000]  We all arrest everybody.
[03:15:36.000 --> 03:15:38.000]  Father, mother, this is a bad word.
[03:15:38.000 --> 03:15:39.000]  I agree.
[03:15:39.000 --> 03:15:40.000]  Take him all to prison.
[03:15:40.000 --> 03:15:44.000]  I mean, look, men with wigs should be able to go and spy in mall bathrooms is fine.
[03:15:44.000 --> 03:15:45.000]  That's right.
[03:15:45.000 --> 03:15:50.000]  That's our real liberty not to have the NSA spy on us or them have forced inoculations
[03:15:50.000 --> 03:15:52.000]  or sign us on to foreign debt.
[03:15:52.000 --> 03:15:57.000]  The real freedom Anthony is that, you know, six foot five guys can go in the men women
[03:15:57.000 --> 03:15:58.000]  party.
[03:15:58.000 --> 03:16:02.000]  Now, did you hear they're trying to have a move to ban urinals as a form of male dominance?
[03:16:02.000 --> 03:16:06.000]  You know, I went to Washington, D.C. a while ago and they only had women's bathrooms.
[03:16:06.000 --> 03:16:07.000]  There was no men's.
[03:16:07.000 --> 03:16:10.000]  So I was asked the manager, is there a men's bathroom?
[03:16:10.000 --> 03:16:12.000]  They're like, yeah, it's the women's bathroom.
[03:16:12.000 --> 03:16:14.000]  If a woman's not in it, you can use it.
[03:16:14.000 --> 03:16:18.000]  We don't get bathrooms anymore.
[03:16:18.000 --> 03:16:22.000]  We got a bunch of con artist pervs that run the private fellow reserve and college federal.
[03:16:22.000 --> 03:16:23.000]  We put up with all this.
[03:16:23.000 --> 03:16:24.000]  We kind of deserve it, Anthony.
[03:16:24.000 --> 03:16:25.000]  We put up with this much stuff.
[03:16:25.000 --> 03:16:27.000]  By the way, I really like your backwards hat character.
[03:16:27.000 --> 03:16:29.000]  We should bring that on the show permanently.
[03:16:29.000 --> 03:16:30.000]  Say what?
[03:16:30.000 --> 03:16:31.000]  Why don't you interview me?
[03:16:31.000 --> 03:16:32.000]  I need a hat to backwards.
[03:16:32.000 --> 03:16:33.000]  Why don't you?
[03:16:33.000 --> 03:16:34.000]  How don't you interview me right now?
[03:16:34.000 --> 03:16:35.000]  Okay.
[03:16:35.000 --> 03:16:36.000]  All right.
[03:16:36.000 --> 03:16:37.000]  Let's do this.
[03:16:37.000 --> 03:16:38.000]  This is very serious.
[03:16:38.000 --> 03:16:39.000]  60 minutes interview.
[03:16:39.000 --> 03:16:40.000]  Yeah.
[03:16:40.000 --> 03:16:41.000]  I think racism is bad.
[03:16:41.000 --> 03:16:44.000]  I think the mother and father and he and she could be hurtful.
[03:16:44.000 --> 03:16:47.000]  Why, if somebody ain't a hit your shit, that makes them feel bad.
[03:16:47.000 --> 03:16:52.000]  I don't think we should have any identity, but what the TV says.
[03:16:52.000 --> 03:16:53.000]  No, I agree.
[03:16:53.000 --> 03:16:54.000]  Let me ask you a question.
[03:16:54.000 --> 03:16:55.000]  What do you think about brown paper bags?
[03:16:55.000 --> 03:16:57.000]  Do those offend you?
[03:16:57.000 --> 03:16:59.000]  They told me that was racist and I agree.
[03:16:59.000 --> 03:17:00.000]  We shouldn't use it.
[03:17:00.000 --> 03:17:02.000]  I do whatever I'm told.
[03:17:02.000 --> 03:17:04.000]  I'm a social justice lawyer.
[03:17:04.000 --> 03:17:08.000]  And if you don't agree, you'll be screamed at and cursed at and attacked.
[03:17:08.000 --> 03:17:09.000]  And that's how it is.
[03:17:09.000 --> 03:17:11.000]  There's no intellectual debate.
[03:17:11.000 --> 03:17:13.000]  You'll just be attacked.
[03:17:13.000 --> 03:17:17.000]  I support a lot of fluoride and I'm feeling pretty good right now.
[03:17:17.000 --> 03:17:18.000]  Yeah.
[03:17:18.000 --> 03:17:21.000]  You look like you're feeling really good.
[03:17:21.000 --> 03:17:24.000]  I was watching MTV though.
[03:17:24.000 --> 03:17:27.000]  It's all that matters actually.
[03:17:27.000 --> 03:17:29.000]  Reality television is all that matters.
[03:17:29.000 --> 03:17:32.000]  If you're going to watch anything, at least just watch that, right?
[03:17:32.000 --> 03:17:34.000]  Oh, I think you should put double hats.
[03:17:34.000 --> 03:17:38.000]  I think you should put both on backwards.
[03:17:38.000 --> 03:17:40.000]  This is what we really want to see here.
[03:17:40.000 --> 03:17:42.000]  Look at that.
[03:17:42.000 --> 03:17:44.000]  Available at infowarestore.com.
[03:17:44.000 --> 03:17:46.000]  This is quality content right here.
[03:17:46.000 --> 03:17:48.000]  That's a good photo actually.
[03:17:48.000 --> 03:17:50.000]  That should be your new press photo right there.
[03:17:50.000 --> 03:17:55.000]  You should send out that to everyone.
[03:17:55.000 --> 03:18:03.000]  Alex Jones shows his true self, his true beliefs on air.
[03:18:03.000 --> 03:18:05.000]  He's also known as unresistible to women.
[03:18:05.000 --> 03:18:07.000]  Even though that's an unproper gender.
[03:18:07.000 --> 03:18:13.000]  It's like ladies look, you think this guy's confident, okay?
[03:18:13.000 --> 03:18:17.000]  Hey, infowarestore.com folks, on the war machine.
[03:18:17.000 --> 03:18:19.000]  I'm self-deprecating on purpose.
[03:18:19.000 --> 03:18:21.000]  People say you're leading a serious movement.
[03:18:21.000 --> 03:18:22.000]  Why do you joke around some?
[03:18:22.000 --> 03:18:25.000]  Because it's about having fun when we dominate the globalists.
[03:18:25.000 --> 03:18:27.000]  I mean, what a bunch of crazies.
[03:18:27.000 --> 03:18:30.000]  They've turned all these little desperate TV heads that won't have jobs,
[03:18:30.000 --> 03:18:34.000]  all these fake college degrees into thinking they obsess all day over where they go pee-pee.
[03:18:34.000 --> 03:18:38.000]  And, you know, I mean, I'm here to tell you folks that you've been set up.
[03:18:38.000 --> 03:18:40.000]  You're being manipulated if you serve the system.
[03:18:40.000 --> 03:18:41.000]  It's time to wake up.
[03:18:41.000 --> 03:18:43.000]  But I saw the social justice warrior footage.
[03:18:43.000 --> 03:18:44.000]  We've been getting all over the country.
[03:18:44.000 --> 03:18:45.000]  Our crew has.
[03:18:45.000 --> 03:18:46.000]  Rob doing bags and everybody else.
[03:18:46.000 --> 03:18:48.000]  These people literally are so stupid.
[03:18:48.000 --> 03:18:49.000]  They're scary.
[03:18:49.000 --> 03:18:50.000]  Gucci already.
[03:18:50.000 --> 03:18:53.000]  And so, I don't know what we do about them, but I tell you,
[03:18:53.000 --> 03:18:56.000]  we're in for a very exciting time, aren't we?
[03:18:56.000 --> 03:18:58.000]  Now, I'll tell you what, if you can't make jokes, you can't have fun.
[03:18:58.000 --> 03:18:59.000]  You already lost.
[03:18:59.000 --> 03:19:02.000]  The political correctness, PC principle, PC police already beat you.
[03:19:02.000 --> 03:19:04.000]  If you can't sit around and have fun.
[03:19:04.000 --> 03:19:05.000]  You PC, bro.
[03:19:05.000 --> 03:19:06.000]  You PC, bro.
[03:19:06.000 --> 03:19:08.000]  You know, PC enough, bro.
[03:19:08.000 --> 03:19:10.000]  We actually could start PC frat.
[03:19:10.000 --> 03:19:12.000]  No, but if you can't make jokes, you can't have fun.
[03:19:12.000 --> 03:19:13.000]  We already lost, right?
[03:19:13.000 --> 03:19:14.000]  So that's the whole point.
[03:19:14.000 --> 03:19:16.000]  Everyone just has to get all serious and care.
[03:19:16.000 --> 03:19:19.000]  What I don't get is how people serving this are idiots admittedly under a documented
[03:19:19.000 --> 03:19:23.000]  declassified brainwashing program, but they don't want to admit they're in a brainwashing
[03:19:23.000 --> 03:19:26.000]  program because they're delusional with cognitive dissonance.
[03:19:26.000 --> 03:19:28.000]  I mean, it's a fact this is going on, my friend.
[03:19:28.000 --> 03:19:32.000]  They have the power of the establishment system behind them when they act all politically
[03:19:32.000 --> 03:19:33.000]  correct and say you're racist.
[03:19:33.000 --> 03:19:36.000]  It's like a ton of power because they're so insecure.
[03:19:36.000 --> 03:19:39.000]  They're associating with the black wings that are under.
[03:19:39.000 --> 03:19:41.000]  I want to come back with Sammy Hengar.
[03:19:41.000 --> 03:19:45.000]  There's only one way to rock because this is a fact and you know it's true.
[03:19:45.000 --> 03:19:49.000]  Anthony Gucciardi straight ahead out of the bullpen straight ahead.
[03:19:49.000 --> 03:19:51.000]  You know, his nickname is BJ.
[03:19:51.000 --> 03:19:52.000]  We'll be back.
[03:19:52.000 --> 03:19:59.000]  Stay with us in FullWars.com.
