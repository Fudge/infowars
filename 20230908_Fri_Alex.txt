[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.000]  It's Friday, September 8th, 2023, and you're tuned in from the program that globalists fear the most, massive news straight ahead. Stay with us.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000]  InfoWars, tomorrow's news today.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:29.000]  It's Friday, September 8th, 2023, and we're not talking about conspiracy theories here today.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:40.000]  We're not talking about theoretical things. We're not talking about things that are fiction or postulating possible futures.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:49.000]  We're talking about what is known to be deployed that is being rolled out right now against humanity.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:01.000]  And one of my greatest frustrations of only 29 years is I'd read Pentagon documents that were public 25, 26 years ago about spider goats that are part spider that create body armor through their milk.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000]  But the Pentagon, for a giant project, China has it as well.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000]  And callers would call in and say, there's no way we have goats spliced with spiders, that's just made up.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:22.000]  It's this week they came out and said, yeah, we've created humanoids in the laboratory that don't have any sperm or eggs involved or any parents.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000]  But we're not going to upset you. It's discreet. We're not going to show them to you.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]  So see, we don't have little great men from Mars landing, little green men.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000]  We don't have foreign aliens proven here, but we have alien life forms being created on Earth.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:48.000]  So here we are on this special Friday transmission, the Alex Jones Show 2.0, exclusively at Steven Crowder and the Mug Club.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:02:04.000]  Music.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000]  Initiating launch phase. Human resistance.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000]  Music.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:26.000]  Friday, September 8th, 2023, the broadcast enemy fears because they fear the truth and they fear our God.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:42.000]  Music.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:03:03.000]  Music.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:17.000]  We've not forgotten the people of Bahina, Maui. We've got a rescue worker, a very well-accredited, very accomplished individual who has been, lives there and has been there for weeks.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:25.000]  And he's ready to join us in the third hour to give us a breakdown on what really happened there. Look for that important interview two hours from now.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000]  In the meantime, the UN came out and said, okay, the variant's totally deadly. We need new controls right now.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:40.000]  Schools all over the country are saying if they get one case, they're shutting it a bunch of shut.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:50.000]  New York system-wide mask. It's all back. D.C. all back. L.A. bringing it back. Told you they were.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:59.000]  WHO sounds major alarm over concerning COVID wave coming this winter as deaths soar. Yeah, from the shots.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:13.000]  Major new developments there. Then, of course, we're going to do a deep dive on the border because the destruction of our country deliberately at the hands of the New World Order has never been more obvious.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:28.000]  It's in the Associated Press. It's in the L.A. Times. It's in Fox News. Biden administration set to announce federal regulations, not law, that illegal aliens cannot leave the state they're shipped into.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:42.000]  And that they're going to monitor them and let them stay. But as terms of their release and getting taxpayer welfare, they must stay in Texas and Arizona.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:58.000]  You're not allowed to go to Illinois or New York. Wow. And there's a lot more of that. Oh, the Democrats are openly veining R.F. King Jr. from being on the ballot. Stay with us.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000]  I didn't realize this was back this week. I thought it was next week. I come in this morning. It's back in the warehouse ready to roll.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:18.000]  Body's ultimate formula. And the first thing I did was pop one of these bad boys overhead shot, please. Look how full this model is.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:27.000]  Right to the top, folks. Right to the top with these. Ninety five percent of human life.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:38.000]  Again, most turmeric formulas are five percent. Some are maybe 10. The other strongest brands are 75 percent. This is 95 percent.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:46.000]  Super constant. So like taking one pills, like taking 10 of the average pill. It's that powerful or more.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:52.000]  So they're available at Infowarsstore.com. Body's ultimate turmeric formula.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:00.000]  Called out for almost eight months. Back in stock at Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:22.000]  Monday through Friday, from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central, the broadcast, the enemy dredge is live.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000]  And it's because of our guests, our calls, our research, our will that they fear it.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:36.000]  And it's not a statement of bragging to say they fear it. That it insanely drives them into Feds.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:42.000]  We need to know what they fear. We need to know what's got their number. And it's this broadcast.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:52.000]  It's this audience of activists. So on this Friday transmission, I salute you. I salute the stations, the affiliates, the sponsors, the crew, the callers, everybody that makes the transmission possible.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:07:06.000]  Okay. Wow. The World War III news is off the hook, off the chain. The open border news is more insane and redonkulous than ever.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:15.000]  We have just got incredible world government ESG censorship news. It's all I can say.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:21.000]  You know, as soon as I saw this story, I knew it was true. This one right here.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:29.000]  Because it actually came out last year at the time, but didn't really make a lot of headway. The story didn't get legs.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:40.000]  And that was these boats, these drone boats loaded up with explosives that were using Starlink to sink a Russian battleship.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:49.000]  And then they were going to try to attack a Russian port with it. And Elon Musk turned off the satellites so they couldn't do it.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:56.000]  And the Ukrainian government has said, Musk is committing evil. Well, I thought it's his company.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:04.000]  If he doesn't want the Starlink system used as a weapons satellite, I mean, you think an AT&T satellite is doing this stuff? No.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:11.000]  You have military satellites, you have research satellites, you have communication satellites. Military, research, communication.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:18.000]  And when Musk first gave them a bunch of Starlink units, I said, this is bad.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:28.000]  And this is, again, a private tech space company involved. And then we now know it wasn't just Musk.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:36.000]  The Pentagon was concerned about this because the Ukrainians, that's why the Pentagon doesn't give the Ukrainians missiles that go more than 50 miles,
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000]  because they keep shooting them into Russia, which is going to escalate this. And some people want to escalate the Pentagon.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000]  Others that don't want to blow the planet up, who aren't completely insane, don't want to.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]  And so there's two major camps there. Well, there's really more, but two large camps.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.000]  The neo-con globalist insane World War III nuclear war survivable group, and then the other ones that are like,
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000]  no, every scenario shows this only ends in bad and it's not survivable and destroys civilization. Let's stop now.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:11.000]  So the ADL is saying, see, we need Musk taken off the air, we need Twitter taken over.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000]  Why? We've got extra guards at our facilities because he's sending people to attack us.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]  Made up, crazy, you're trying to bully him, you're trying to take over Twitter, you're trying to censor everybody,
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]  it's on record, you're already doing it, you got caught, you're doing it with all the other tech companies.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:34.000]  But separately it's, well, Musk committed great evil. He didn't let his civilian satellite system be used,
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000]  after he knew it was being used, to attack Russian targets in Russia.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000]  And that's the port there on the Black Sea.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:55.000]  So Russia told the Pentagon last year, it's all admitted here now, that if you attack any more of our ships and anchor in our port,
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000]  we are going to take that as an attack by NATO.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:05.000]  And the fact that you are asking Elon Musk to give thousands more of these units to do this,
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000]  to put a unit in the boat or whatever system it is and then deploy it,
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000]  if you do that, again, we are going to consider it an attack by NATO,
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]  and our threat doctrine says we're going to start attacking NATO sites.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000]  Now we already have Zelensky caught last year firing two missiles into Poland,
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000]  lying and saying that the Russians did it, but the Poles had the radar trajectory,
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000]  the missiles were launched out of eastern Ukraine, right on the border,
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:39.000]  and the Poles shot them both down so they didn't fully detonate on the ground and destroy the entire missile,
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:48.000]  they shot them down in the air, cut them in pieces so they got the tail fins that were Ukrainian missiles.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000]  So we avoided that, and there's been a bunch of other scenarios like that.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:01.000]  Remember Zelensky said, we have been hit, and Russia has hit Poland,
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000]  and we need full war and NATO right now.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:13.000]  Then separately, you've got the bridge that comes out of Russia into Crimea that they keep trying to blow up,
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:20.000]  with a truck bomb and then with these naval drones, which really service torpedoes,
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000]  and so Musk said, I'm not in this war, I want to sell this to everybody,
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000]  and we're not going to have military action with these anymore,
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000]  and so the last I heard, he's just turned them all off there.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:40.000]  So that just gives you an example of where all this is going,
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:51.000]  and then you can ask, well why didn't the Pentagon use their satellites to direct these surface drones, these water drones?
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000]  Well because that's direct war with Russia and Congress has not approved that,
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000]  but really Congress has not officially approved any of this stuff that's going on,
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:06.000]  so we are rapidly sleepwalking into thermal nuclear war,
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000]  and all I can say is, I know the inside baseball on Musk, I don't completely trust him,
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000]  I'm always going to sleep with one eye open, but I know people that know him well,
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000]  he's got dozens of federal lawsuits, the Justice Department after him,
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:28.000]  the FTC, all of them, they've taken his son, they're about to chop his penis off in the system,
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000]  and his brother almost died from the shot, he got sick from it,
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000]  and all I see is good action out of Musk now.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000]  Obviously he wants a monopoly on tech, he wants to be the cyborg guy,
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.000]  he wants to do all this, he wants to dominate it and have these driverless cars,
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000]  and all these things that are part of the agenda,
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000]  and he's heavily in bed with China, but what big company isn't?
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000]  I'm just saying, let's say he was going in the direction of the New World Order five years ago,
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:03.000]  he's done a 160 right now, he's not done a 180, but he's rapidly, he was a ship turning around,
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000]  the ship's pointing north, he's already gone around 160 degrees due south,
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000]  and he's moving quickly to be in direct alignment with my views,
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:22.000]  and with just common sense analysis, so I'm not going to bitch and complain,
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.000]  when one of the kingpins of the system is coming around to us and is almost there.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000]  The analogy is he was ten miles away from us, and now he's right down the street waving at us,
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:41.000]  and he's coming to us, and there may be some larger backup plan to blame this establishment for the problems
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000]  and bring him in as a savior later, whatever, we'll deal with that then,
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:55.000]  but I'm not going to sit here when Vivek Ramanwani or Tulsi Gabbards or RFK Jr. comes out against open borders,
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:03.000]  comes out against gun control, comes out against human smuggling, comes out against carbon taxes like RFK and Tulsi have,
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000]  and then say, well Tulsi once went and spoke at the WEF, they all do,
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000]  or well you know he's still for abortion, yeah I don't agree with that,
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:19.000]  but you cannot bitch and just say screw them when they're hitting on all cylinders,
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000]  and folks I've told you this for 20 years, I'm on air 29, but I figured this out about 20 years ago,
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000]  I've said this probably 5,000 times, I'll say it again, I said it yesterday, I said it before, I said it last week,
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000]  I'll probably say it next hour, there's not just evil in the universe,
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:44.000]  and one of the biggest reasons we fail is we expect that the enemy is overwhelmingly powerful
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000]  and there's only evil in the universe, and so we never dare to do bold things,
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000]  because we think it's too insurmountable or too big, we're convincing almost everybody to join us,
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000]  I had dinner with Joe Rogan recently, and he was just completely on fire,
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000]  as hardcore as I am, knew everything, and on his show he's blasting them everywhere,
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:08.000]  he's like you were right, you were right about everything, my God, and he was just finishing my sentences for me,
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000]  I'd be like well the real issue, you have to understand what they've done with COVID,
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000]  is it was about corrupting the system so they could blackmail them,
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.000]  and then he just finished my sentences and went on with it,
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000]  so again, have we won? No. Are we turning the tide? Yes.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:33.000]  Praise God, and just be aware of that fact, and pass the ammunition of the info war,
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:40.000]  so when we come back, I want to hit the border, because it's really had a bunch of big developments,
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000]  and so much more, but when people are trying to come around to us and join us,
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000]  and defect to our side, let's not give them the keys of the kingdom,
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000]  let's not put them in charge, but let's sure as hell let them join us and prove themselves,
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000]  we'll be right back, stay with us.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000]  And we sold out of atom and mineral fusion,
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000]  and X3 limited supply we got, there's like 500 bottles left,
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000]  X3, I don't know when we're going to get it back in, it's hard to manufacture this stuff, it's so high quality,
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000]  the missing link is iodine, this is the best iodine you're going to find,
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000]  X3 is about to sell out, but I'm keeping it at 40% off,

[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000]  that are listeners and patriots that are allowing us to private label it
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000]  at a lower price than you'll find in stores.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000]  It's Joint Relief Max and Nerve Renew.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000]  Both of these have known documented natural compounds to lower pain
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000]  and to also make your nerves healthier,
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000]  which is one of the major reasons nerves get irritated
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.000]  and are more inductive to pain.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000]  There's major research behind this all.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000]  You need to get Joint Relief Max from Infowars MD

[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.000]  and they fund their operation.
[00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:07.570]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:26.660]  I want to lay something out here that's critical and that it's that globalism is corporate
[00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:32.540]  government alliance administratively attacking any company, any business, any individual,
[00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:37.700]  any family that they don't own and control and consolidating that.
[00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:39.780]  That's what the lockdowns were.
[00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:42.260]  The average billionaire more than doubled their wealth.
[00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:45.139]  The average family or individual went into huge debt.
[00:20:45.139 --> 00:20:47.260]  It shut down around a third of our small businesses.
[00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:49.780]  It just devastated the third world.
[00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:53.879]  And it's the same thing with the dumbing down of the children and the open borders
[00:20:53.879 --> 00:20:59.660]  and the defunding police and the exploding crime is it's demoralizing us.
[00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:01.900]  It's an attempt to break our will.
[00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:09.660]  So three, four, five million conservatively illegal aliens come across each year.
[00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:13.379]  And when they get here, it's under UN control.
[00:21:13.379 --> 00:21:15.460]  They've got UN debit cards.
[00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:16.460]  They're signed up.
[00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:20.200]  The Democratic Party, the Democrat Party, these lawyers take part of their paychecks.
[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:26.220]  They also sign up for welfare, welfare fraud, tax returns, you name it, of money that
[00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:30.620]  they aren't owed and they steal it.
[00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:35.900]  And the people they're bringing in are totally being exploited, just like they farm the homeless.
[00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:39.260]  They have aid workers that will get hundreds of thousands of dollars a year per homeless
[00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:43.580]  person and the homeless person might get $30,000 of it.
[00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:49.860]  So they use the social safety net to create a spider's web to capture people in it.
[00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:53.160]  So Texas has tried to put up floating barriers in the Rio Grande.
[00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:54.900]  The feds are suing.
[00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:57.540]  States are threatening criminal charges.
[00:21:57.540 --> 00:21:59.780]  The governor has shipped some illegals to California.
[00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:02.700]  They're talking about criminal charges against Governor Abbott.
[00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:04.700]  I'll show you that article.
[00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:06.500]  So they tell the illegals, come here.
[00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:08.900]  They say it's a sanctuary city.
[00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:13.660]  We then in our states that are overwhelmed and paying for all of us ship a few, a small
[00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:20.820]  percent to New York and Illinois and other places, Massachusetts, Martha's Vineyard,
[00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:22.220]  and they ship them out immediately.
[00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:26.340]  It's the same thing in the UK, same thing in Europe.
[00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:36.380]  The same NGOs that are UN run, run the border operation, entering command on record of ICE.
[00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:40.340]  And it's about human smuggling, sex trafficking, drugs, you know, all God's children is what
[00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:44.659]  Nancy Pelosi called MS 13 a few years ago.
[00:22:44.659 --> 00:22:50.740]  So Biden administration considers forcing illegals to stay in Texas as blue states complain
[00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:53.820]  about the illegal aliens and the cost.
[00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:54.820]  Here's Fox News.
[00:22:54.820 --> 00:23:01.340]  Administration considering plan to force migrants to remain in Texas report from the LA times.
[00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:06.580]  Texas is in the midst of a feud with administration over the state's migrant busing program and
[00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:07.980]  floating barriers.
[00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:14.300]  And it goes on to say Biden administration has told eyes that they are preparing to
[00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:19.460]  bring in regulations where the illegals will be made to wear ankle monitors and must
[00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:22.460]  stay in Texas.
[00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:26.659]  And that will, quote, curb the flow of illegal immigrants on the southern border.
[00:23:26.659 --> 00:23:31.020]  The Los Angeles Times citing three U.S. officials not authorized to discuss the matter.
[00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:34.659]  The plan would force migrants to remain in Texas or possibly other border states by
[00:23:34.659 --> 00:23:38.700]  tracking their location of GPS monitoring devices such as ankle bracelets, the officials
[00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:39.700]  told the Times.
[00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:41.980]  Really, it's their cell phone.
[00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:42.980]  And it goes on.
[00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:48.900]  So come here if I win the election, immediately surge the border.
[00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:50.620]  Remember those clips?
[00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:51.940]  He said it twice in debates.
[00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:56.540]  I played it probably 500 times if I could play it again, I can't stand to look at Biden.
[00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:58.580]  But he said that.
[00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:03.340]  And they come here, he violates federal law, he won't let federal judges or magistrates
[00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:06.260]  hold people that are violating the law, including pedophiles.
[00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:08.940]  That's come out of this.
[00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:13.540]  And then they turn around and say, by the way, they're going to stay in Texas.
[00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:15.420]  And then these people will be signed up to vote.
[00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:17.620]  People say, oh, the illegals don't vote.
[00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:21.659]  Democrats all over the country and their states have legalized illegals voting and legalized
[00:24:21.659 --> 00:24:25.580]  illegals being police officers.
[00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:29.340]  It's just next level, but it gets worse.
[00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:34.220]  Sanctuary City of Los Angeles considers criminal charges against Texas for sending them illegal
[00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:37.220]  immigrants.
[00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:39.460]  Texas has sent a total of 11 buses of migrants to Los Angeles.
[00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:44.900]  Oh boy, it's like 11 buses coming across Texas every five minutes, beginning with the
[00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:49.820]  June 14th arrival containing a total of 435, quote, migrants.
[00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:50.820]  Well they're migrating.
[00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:52.460]  Come to your state.
[00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:55.940]  Big giant article sending criminal charges against the governor and others.
[00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:57.100]  Here's another one.
[00:24:57.100 --> 00:25:04.940]  Judge orders Texas to remove floating border barriers, granting Biden ministrations request.
[00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:14.400]  So Texas on its own side of the river can't even stick up a floating barrier.
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:16.180]  And the feds are blocking that.
[00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:17.300]  But then you got to stay here.
[00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:21.220]  We got to pay for it.
[00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:26.580]  Canada is complaining about the tens of thousands coming in to their borders from the U.S. every
[00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:27.580]  week.
[00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:32.300]  They decry surge illegal migrants at the northern border.
[00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:43.740]  And what did the mayor of New York, the race-baiting Al Sharpton 2.0, let's even say
[00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:44.900]  it's destroying us.
[00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:47.780]  The city's falling apart.
[00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:50.659]  And they're giving the illegals $10,000 a month in New York.
[00:25:50.659 --> 00:25:54.060]  Wow, that's pretty good money.
[00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:59.940]  A Social Security recipient maxing out their payment is what, a little over $2,000?
[00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:03.900]  So you paid into this your whole life, you get $2,000.
[00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:08.180]  But the state gives you $10,000, the feds give the illegals a couple thousand because
[00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:09.300]  they want them here.
[00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:12.940]  Oh, and the illegals might not want to take a poison shot, so they're all exempt in
[00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:16.020]  the public schools, not just in New York but across the country.
[00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:17.340]  Oh, you're an illegal alien.
[00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:19.139]  You don't need ID to fly.
[00:26:19.139 --> 00:26:20.139]  You're an illegal alien.
[00:26:20.139 --> 00:26:23.220]  You don't need a vaccine.
[00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:24.220]  By the way, it's a lie.
[00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:25.220]  They can't make any of us take it.
[00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:29.139]  But they fired 70,000 healthcare workers in New York alone that wouldn't take a shot.
[00:26:29.139 --> 00:26:30.860]  They kicked out tens of thousands of military.
[00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:33.700]  See how it works?
[00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:35.340]  Citizens are at the lowest ruin.
[00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:36.340]  We're like the slave.
[00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:40.659]  It's like a caste system like they had in India, where you've got the Brahmin up at
[00:26:40.659 --> 00:26:45.940]  the top, and then you've got the ministerial people, and then you've got the servant class
[00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:51.620]  at the bottom that can never get out of their caste.
[00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:53.020]  And that's who we are as citizens.
[00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:55.580]  We're the schmucks that pay the bills.
[00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:59.860]  We're the schmucks that, you know, oh, you got waved in by police at the Capitol,
[00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:03.139]  you didn't hurt anybody, you're getting five years in prison, we're going to swat
[00:27:03.139 --> 00:27:09.040]  team your ass and put you in solitary confinement because we're the FBI.
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:10.540]  Because you're the enemy.
[00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:13.260]  You're the American that thinks they have a bill of rights, a constitution.
[00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:20.060]  We're going to go to break in a few minutes and come back with Eric Adams saying, quote,
[00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:21.980]  New York will collapse.
[00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:24.060]  New York is being destroyed.
[00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:25.960]  Really buddy boy?
[00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:29.020]  What do you think's happening to the rest of the country?
[00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:31.940]  Gavin Newsom, buddy boy, what do you think?
[00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:41.380]  All of these governors and mayors see the crime and the people everywhere and the breakdown
[00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:45.980]  of society, and then they turn around and say, not here.
[00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:49.700]  And Eric Adams wants to ship them to Long Island.
[00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:53.820]  Yeah, let's take 100,000, that's what's in New York, conservatively, that don't
[00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:54.820]  have a place to stay.
[00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:55.820]  The hotels are all full.
[00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:56.820]  You name it.
[00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:57.820]  They're putting them in luxury hotels.
[00:27:57.820 --> 00:28:03.380]  Let's ship 100,000 people and just throw them out on the street in Rhode Island.
[00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:09.580]  Let's ship them up to Kingston or Rochester or Buffalo.
[00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:12.700]  That's the same thing over and over again, isn't it?
[00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:15.060]  But don't come to Martha's Vineyard one busload.
[00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:17.340]  No, you're gone in one day.
[00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:19.020]  Get your ass out of here.
[00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:21.300]  You don't come to where Obama lives.
[00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:24.300]  No sir.
[00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:26.540]  No sir.
[00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:29.780]  Not in my backyard, in your backyard, and does it help the third world?
[00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:34.380]  People know it lowers us to their level, which is what Ross Perot said, he said, you
[00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:38.380]  pass this NAFTA and this can't be a giant second sound, you're not going to help
[00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:39.380]  Mexico.
[00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:43.020]  You're going to lower their level when this is all done as well and lower us.
[00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:45.380]  Higher standards will raise them up.
[00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:47.060]  Lower standards will lower us off.
[00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:51.139]  He said that 30 years ago, and he was absolutely right.
[00:28:51.139 --> 00:28:52.820]  We'll be right back.
[00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:53.820]  Stay with us.
[00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:56.179]  Infowars.com and on video.
[00:28:56.540 --> 00:29:00.420]  Thank you.
[00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:01.420]  Bodies is back.
[00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:05.860]  The ultimate turmeric product on the market has returned to Infowarsstore.com and is
[00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:08.780]  now 25% off for a limited time.
[00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:13.380]  Utilized for thousands of years, turmeric is one of the most studied medicinal herbs
[00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:14.380]  today.
[00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:18.480]  Hundreds of peer reviewed scientific articles are published every year on the chemistry
[00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:22.540]  and therapeutic potential of turmeric and its active components.
[00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:27.300]  Bodies will reduce inflammation throughout the body, help boost and support flexibility,
[00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:33.060]  increase mobility, assist in joint function, bolster your immune system and so much more.
[00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:38.460]  Regular turmeric from the store contains about 1 to 5% of the active ingredient curcuminoids,
[00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:44.139]  but our super powerful extract using bodies contains over 95% of the active ingredients
[00:29:44.139 --> 00:29:45.139]  in turmeric.
[00:29:45.139 --> 00:29:48.580]  No other product can compare with this curcuminoid delivery system.
[00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:52.340]  So if you want to put the true power of turmeric to the test, then look no further.

[00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:03.040]  It's just six feet.
[00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:05.580]  It's just non-essential businesses.
[00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:08.020]  It's just non-essential workers.
[00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:10.540]  It's just until we work it out.
[00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:12.100]  It's just a bar.

[00:30:16.159 --> 00:30:17.980]  It's just schools.
[00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:21.300]  It's just to keep from overwhelming medical services.
[00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:23.900]  It's just until the cases go down.
[00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:26.139]  It's just to flatten the curve.
[00:30:26.139 --> 00:30:28.980]  It's just to keep others feeling safe.

[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:40.179]  It's just singing.
[00:30:40.179 --> 00:30:42.820]  It's just travel.
[00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:45.300]  It's just until we get a vaccine.
[00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:47.300]  It's just for the greater good.
[00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:51.179]  It's just fact checking, not censorship.

[00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:54.940]  It isn't just at all.

[00:32:08.159 --> 00:32:13.280]  They can be found in grass fed beef, which is why the ruling class is trying to ban
[00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:14.280]  it.
[00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:20.639]  They can be found in fish, which are arguably the best source of Omega-3s, but the problem

[00:35:18.279 --> 00:35:25.840]  All right, so it is beyond obvious, it's the UN plan to collapse the third world and
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:30.560]  organize the groups and have the State Department give them debit cards to come into
[00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:35.799]  the United States and just flood everywhere, just everywhere.
[00:35:35.799 --> 00:35:42.740]  And in the studies with the North African and Middle Eastern folks that come in, after
[00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:47.520]  five years, 90% don't have a job, because there aren't the jobs.
[00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:52.640]  I mean, Spain has like 40% unemployment, and they've just shipped millions into there.
[00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:58.720]  Okay, Italy, huge unemployment, 30%, here, let's put in 5 million there, England,
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:35:59.720]  you name it.
[00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:03.360]  And you read these articles, they're in mainstream news, it doesn't sound believable.
[00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:08.759]  Well, a couple thousand arrived in the last few days on Zodiac boats from France, and
[00:36:08.759 --> 00:36:12.480]  the French are like, here, we'll offload them on you.
[00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:15.319]  And then they put them in luxury hotels and kick everybody out.
[00:36:15.319 --> 00:36:20.779]  And in some cases, they've been there two, three years just sitting in a luxury hotel.
[00:36:20.779 --> 00:36:26.840]  But notice, France ships them to the UK.
[00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:31.560]  In Germany, they'll ship them out of the elite area into a small village of poor people.
[00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:32.560]  It's the same thing here.
[00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:34.960]  They tell them, come, come here, come, come.
[00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:39.720]  And then, okay, well, Democrats are mad that you're coming to Illinois and New York, and
[00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:47.600]  Wisconsin, and Minnesota, and California, and everywhere else.
[00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:51.560]  So we'll just ship them to Texas.
[00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:57.319]  And then we'll tell them, with a GPS phone they got to have, and a GPS monitor on their
[00:36:57.319 --> 00:37:04.720]  ankle, your court date set in 2032 is the average court date, currently, 2032, nine
[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:06.040]  years from now.
[00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:09.360]  You can do whatever you want, we'll sign you up with lawyers to get you on welfare
[00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:13.360]  and get you a job, we'll skim the money.
[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:18.240]  But you can't leave Texas.
[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:24.360]  And then you tell them, hey, you want to stay here, we're going to deport you if you don't
[00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:28.920]  go vote, if you don't go sign up to vote.
[00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:31.720]  And that's how you turn Texas blue.
[00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:35.620]  And the Democrats are like, we'll arrest anybody who says illegals are voting.
[00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:38.640]  Some of the charges in Georgia on Trump is he claims illegals voted.
[00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:42.080]  It's on record, 40-something thousand illegals voted in Georgia they know of.
[00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:44.600]  They use their names.
[00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:45.600]  They did it.
[00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:51.400]  50,000 they found in Michigan of dead people.
[00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:56.680]  And again, Owen Schroyer may not be here next week.
[00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:59.240]  And I've been asked by his lawyer not to antagonize the system.
[00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:02.040]  Not antagonize the system, okay.
[00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:06.560]  But it is a big news item, it's all over the place, that they put in the sentencing
[00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:10.120]  recommendation from the feds, like it was two days ago, stacked.
[00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:12.440]  Will you guys repull that for me or reprint it?
[00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:15.319]  This doesn't even sound real, but the gateway pundit reported on it.
[00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:20.600]  And I was gonna shut up about it, but I just, Owen said do whatever you think's best.
[00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:23.040]  And I just, it's his life.
[00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:29.520]  And they say on August 27th, he said the election was stolen again and that Joe Biden's
[00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:30.520]  a pedophile.
[00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:36.480]  Therefore, we recommend, because he's not repentant for lying, that he serve prison
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:37.480]  time.
[00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:44.880]  I mean, it actually says it four or five times.
[00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:46.920]  So they go, but we're not violating his First Amendment.
[00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:50.160]  They give some Supreme Court ruling, doesn't even say that.
[00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:55.200]  But we want jail time for being at the Capitol trying to keep people from going in.
[00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:58.600]  And people say, well, why didn't they charge me?
[00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:02.900]  They're trying, they're going around.
[00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:05.720]  We knew there was nothing on Owen's phone, so we didn't play anything.
[00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:09.440]  But they told Owen, you know, we'll go easy on you, won't go for any criminal
[00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:10.440]  time.
[00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:11.440]  Just give us your phone.
[00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:13.960]  Gave the phone, they said, you don't have a written agreement.
[00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:16.160]  There's nothing on the phone.
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:21.319]  Remember the headline, oh, Owen's turning state's evidence, he's going to expose
[00:39:21.319 --> 00:39:22.319]  Alex Jones.
[00:39:22.319 --> 00:39:23.319]  Why you agreed to give?
[00:39:23.319 --> 00:39:24.840]  Owen asked, do you mind if I do this?
[00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:27.120]  And I said, it's up to you and your lawyer, I mean, there's nothing there.
[00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:28.120]  We didn't play anything.
[00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:33.240]  Of course, the text messages are like, we got to stop this.
[00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:34.240]  We don't go attack capitals.
[00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:37.400]  I've been to all these other protests where we go into the Georgia Capitol, the Texas
[00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:38.400]  Capitol.
[00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:39.400]  We ever attack anybody?
[00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:40.400]  No, that's not what I do.
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:41.400]  I don't go attack the police.
[00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:42.520]  I never will.
[00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:43.520]  Not my MO.
[00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:44.520]  I'm a Christian conservative.
[00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:47.440]  Plus, it's a dumb thing to do.
[00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:53.520]  We wanted a 10-day investigation of the Senate that's in the Constitution and the law.
[00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:58.400]  So it's just mind-blowing.
[00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:05.080]  You know, I am going to cover it, so go ahead and print me the Senate's recommendation
[00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:06.880]  by the prosecutors, and I'll read it.
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:10.279]  It's like 30 pages long, but I'll scan over it, and sometime today I'm just going
[00:40:10.279 --> 00:40:13.560]  to show it to you, because I don't like to just say something, and I'll show you.
[00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:21.920]  It says, he is unrepentant, he is unrepentant, and he's not sorry for what he did, and
[00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:25.759]  he attacked the Capitol, total lie.
[00:40:25.759 --> 00:40:29.680]  And he brought them there to attack it, total lie.
[00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:35.880]  And Jones' people intimidated the Capitol Police and didn't have permission to be there.
[00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:38.520]  We get there and say, you got emergency speakers, you got to get on them and tell everybody
[00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:39.520]  to get out.
[00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:42.480]  I'm going to get over there and tell them, you know, don't go in the building.
[00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:44.120]  They said, sure, go ahead.
[00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:45.319]  We have it all on footage.
[00:40:45.319 --> 00:40:50.359]  All the feds have is the footage that live-streamed by other people.
[00:40:50.359 --> 00:40:54.440]  We have, and it's with a bunch of law firms, we've got it, you're not going to stop us.
[00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:59.160]  We have all of the body cams of our 12 security people.
[00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:01.840]  We have the police on video, Capitol Police.
[00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:06.800]  I said, hey, they said, hey, you can't use the loudspeakers, we're not going to use them.
[00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:10.800]  But you can go up to the top and try to use your free speech to stop this.
[00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:11.800]  And I said, okay.
[00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:15.680]  And they gave me time to go up and get in there, tell people, get out of here, don't
[00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:17.440]  go in.
[00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:20.920]  And some listened, some left with me, because I did it on the front of the Capitol, on
[00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:22.240]  the side of the Capitol.
[00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:25.880]  And as soon as I got down off the steps, they flashbanged them, but they still couldn't
[00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:27.120]  stop them when they broke in.
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:32.319]  I'm not saying I deserve a medal or anything, but I mean, I'm literally there stopping
[00:41:32.319 --> 00:41:35.759]  them to go in on one side while the doors were open, they were waving them in through
[00:41:35.759 --> 00:41:37.000]  velvet ropes.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:43.520]  And I'm on the backside or the side saying, okay, if you won't get on the speaker system
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:46.920]  or I can't get on it because by the night time they got it on, you can hear it a mile
[00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:47.920]  away.
[00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:51.160]  This is an emergency area, I do not approach the Capitol, you'll be arrested.
[00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:55.040]  Leave now, leave now.
[00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:59.800]  And I sat there from a rooftop and watched them flashbang and attack a very small group
[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:07.319]  of people that were left as it got dark that were sucked into all that I couldn't stop.
[00:42:07.319 --> 00:42:10.880]  But I went to exercise my First Amendment.
[00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:13.880]  And now Owen Schroyer, it really sunk in this morning.
[00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:18.000]  He gets on an airplane Sunday or Monday morning.
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:25.000]  He flies to DC and they're trying to put him in jail.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:30.880]  And the whole charging document or the recommendation of sentencing is the same charging document
[00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:31.880]  that is a fabrication.
[00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:37.960]  I mean, the thing is a lie, pillar to post, up one side and down the other.
[00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:45.279]  But that's just the feds, you see, they do whatever they want, disgusting.
[00:42:45.279 --> 00:42:49.359]  So we may not have Owen next week, folks.
[00:42:49.359 --> 00:42:50.359]  That's right.
[00:42:50.359 --> 00:42:54.359]  All right, we'll come back, get into the collapse, the border and more.
[00:42:54.359 --> 00:42:56.359]  This is such a sad time.
[00:43:20.359 --> 00:43:25.279]  I mean, it's just so amazing.
[00:43:25.279 --> 00:43:26.279]  God gave it to us.
[00:43:26.279 --> 00:43:28.680]  And it's the strongest humanoid out there.
[00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:32.240]  Other leading brands are like 70% humanoid.
[00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:34.720]  Most brands are 5% human.
[00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:36.759]  And that still does a great thing for you.
[00:43:36.759 --> 00:43:41.560]  This is the strongest anybody makes 95% humanoid.
[00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:44.120]  I am so glad this is back.
[00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:46.120]  I have been out of this myself for months.
[00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:49.240]  We've been sold out of this for almost seven months.
[00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:56.120]  He's ultimate formula package stock 25% off info war store.com or triple eight two five
[00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:57.600]  three three one three nine.
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:03.680]  I want to thank all of you over the years who have supported Infowars financially with
[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:05.640]  word of mouth and prayer.
[00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:09.040]  All the success that we've had together against the globalists and the fact that we're not
[00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:13.600]  caught flat-footed during their major takeover is because of you.
[00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:15.440]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.
[00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:19.640]  I just want to thank you all for buying products at Infowars4.com like books and
[00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:23.359]  films and supplements and water filtration, air filtration and so much more.
[00:44:23.359 --> 00:44:26.359]  But for those of you that want to actually give us a straight donation so we get almost
[00:44:26.359 --> 00:44:30.200]  a hundred percent of the money to fund our operation during this critical time, go to
[00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:36.919]  Infowars4.com and right at the top you'll see a link to make a straight donation, a one-time

[00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:42.520]  anytime.
[00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:44.000]  I want to thank all of you that have donated.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.759]  I want to encourage those of you out there that want to support freedom to take action
[00:44:47.759 --> 00:44:52.000]  now and be part of the global awakening, the new renaissance that's the counter to
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:57.640]  a great reset by going to Infowars4.com and clicking on the donate button and giving today.
[00:44:57.640 --> 00:44:58.640]  Thank you so much for your support.
[00:44:58.640 --> 00:44:59.640]  Please take action.
[00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:04.700]  Infowars4.com is like a grocery store or like a vitamin shop.
[00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:06.560]  We want to have all the best brands.
[00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:08.480]  We want to have a bunch of different choices for you.
[00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:11.160]  So I get constant questions online and in person.
[00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:12.160]  Hey, what's better?
[00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:13.160]  Knockout.
[00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:14.160]  What's better?
[00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:15.160]  Down and out.
[00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:16.160]  What's better?
[00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:17.759]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[00:45:17.759 --> 00:45:23.319]  The answer is different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different people.
[00:45:23.319 --> 00:45:27.440]  So one person might like this coffee, another person likes that coffee.
[00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:28.640]  That's how our bodies work.
[00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:29.640]  They're all very diverse.
[00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:33.640]  But we've been able to private label a national best seller that's been sold for
[00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:39.399]  many years that people love and sold for a lower price under the name InfowarsMD Good

[00:45:59.879 --> 00:46:03.960]  A lot of listeners have complained in the last two years that our amazing high quality
[00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:05.720]  coffee has not been available.
[00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:09.319]  And that's because the prices went up too high for the raw beans and the quality had
[00:46:09.319 --> 00:46:10.319]  gone down some.
[00:46:10.319 --> 00:46:13.600]  I turned down so many companies that wanted to work with us.
[00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:20.279]  But now we have brought back the coffee and it's even better from a national supplier
[00:46:20.279 --> 00:46:23.160]  that's veteran owned and veteran operated.
[00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:26.359]  It's powered by the company Minute Man Coffee.
[00:46:26.359 --> 00:46:32.799]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the best tasting, best smelling, strongest coffee that
[00:46:32.799 --> 00:46:34.399]  I have ever drank.
[00:46:34.399 --> 00:46:36.720]  It is game changing.
[00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:38.879]  All you got to do is buy a bag of it and try it.
[00:46:38.879 --> 00:46:42.319]  I know you're going to be hooked, which will then fund your operation, a 360 win.

[00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:06.120]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:11.100]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:15.379]  It's Friday, September 8th, 2023.
[00:47:15.379 --> 00:47:19.540]  And we're not talking about conspiracy theories here today.
[00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:22.000]  We're not talking about theoretical things.
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:29.779]  We're not talking about things that are fiction or postulating possible futures.
[00:47:29.779 --> 00:47:36.660]  We're talking about what is known to being deployed that is being rolled out right now
[00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:37.660]  against humanity.
[00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:44.180]  One of my greatest frustrations of 29 years is I'd read Pentagon documents that were public
[00:47:44.180 --> 00:47:49.740]  25, 26 years ago about spider goats that are part spider that create body armor through
[00:47:49.740 --> 00:47:50.740]  their milk.
[00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:55.740]  But the Pentagon, for a giant project, China has it as well.
[00:47:55.740 --> 00:47:59.939]  And callers would call in and say, there's no way we have goats spliced with spiders
[00:47:59.939 --> 00:48:02.859]  that's just made up.
[00:48:02.859 --> 00:48:06.500]  This week they came out and said, yeah, we've created humanoids in the laboratory
[00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:13.060]  that don't have any sperm or eggs involved or any parents, but we're not going to upset
[00:48:13.060 --> 00:48:14.060]  you.
[00:48:14.060 --> 00:48:15.060]  It's discreet.
[00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:16.060]  We're not going to show them to you.
[00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:20.779]  So see, we don't have little gray men from Mars landing, little green men.
[00:48:20.779 --> 00:48:25.980]  We don't have foreign aliens proven here, but we have alien life forms being created
[00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:26.980]  on earth.
[00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:35.980]  So here we are on a special Friday transmission, the Alex Jones Show 2.0, exclusively at
[00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:45.100]  Steven Crowder and the Mug Club.
[00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:47.740]  This is the live syndicated radio slash TV broadcast.
[00:48:47.740 --> 00:48:54.060]  But yes, I shot a two and a half hour turn to force breakdown of the DARPA mind
[00:48:54.060 --> 00:49:00.580]  control programs, the spike proteins, chips in our brains, human animal hybrids and
[00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:04.779]  the Pentagon and their spokespersons admitting it all.
[00:49:04.779 --> 00:49:11.540]  I'm at the tape an hour, but once I get going, it's two and a half hours commercial free
[00:49:11.540 --> 00:49:12.540]  at Jones Crowder.com.
[00:49:12.540 --> 00:49:17.580]  You go to Jones Crowder.com, his promo code Alex get a month free and you can see not
[00:49:17.580 --> 00:49:22.379]  just my content, but all of the subscription stuff with Steven Crowder and the Hodge
[00:49:22.379 --> 00:49:25.100]  brothers, the Hodge twins and so much more.
[00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:27.299]  It's all there at Jones Crowder.com.
[00:49:27.299 --> 00:49:29.299]  You want to support us?
[00:49:29.299 --> 00:49:34.560]  Go get that membership and that helps fund everything we're doing here.
[00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:38.040]  Then we'll find us going to the RNC, DNC and a lot of other big events that are coming
[00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:39.040]  in.
[00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:43.640]  There's going to be some big stuff happening in October with the show and some big
[00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:49.879]  announcements and big things that I think will probably get about 200 million views.
[00:49:49.879 --> 00:49:50.879]  That's a conservative number.
[00:49:50.879 --> 00:49:51.879]  I mean, big stuff.
[00:49:51.879 --> 00:49:57.600]  I think a lot of you can put two and two together, but I'm going to leave it at that.
[00:49:57.600 --> 00:50:00.480]  I'm just not going to say anything else.
[00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:02.960]  It's been a painful process being crucified.
[00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:08.520]  It's not been fun in many ways, but it's been very rewarding and enriching to be through
[00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:12.200]  the gauntlet and have the public recognize that we really are the tip of the spear
[00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:15.240]  and we really are having a big effect together.
[00:50:15.240 --> 00:50:19.319]  And so for every evil thing they do to us, God turns it towards good.
[00:50:19.319 --> 00:50:20.640]  It's not fun to be lied about.
[00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:27.859]  I read the stories that come out constantly and none of it's true, just absolute garbage.
[00:50:27.859 --> 00:50:30.839]  But I just realized that's what they do, folks.
[00:50:30.839 --> 00:50:34.080]  That's who they are and that's why they're so discredited and that's why they're trying
[00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:38.120]  to set up an official dictatorship in this country.
[00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:42.480]  Okay, so there's a lot of these clips, everybody's seen them, but there was a new one yesterday
[00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:48.520]  with Eric Adams, the New York mayor that replaced, hard to believe he's better than
[00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:49.520]  the last guy.
[00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:50.520]  That's not saying much.
[00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:57.040]  It's like the last mayor was a 5,000 pound turd and Eric Adams is a 2,000 pound turd,
[00:50:57.040 --> 00:50:58.500]  race baiting constantly, you name it.
[00:50:59.339 --> 00:51:02.660]  New Yorkers are just under total pressure, they can't pay their bills, things are falling
[00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:06.700]  apart and there's 100,000 illegals at least that don't even have jobs just laying around
[00:51:06.700 --> 00:51:07.700]  everywhere.
[00:51:07.700 --> 00:51:10.100]  Most of them are being put up in nice hotels.
[00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:14.140]  He's trying to ship them again to different parts of New York and he goes to Biden and
[00:51:14.140 --> 00:51:17.660]  says, we need money for this and Biden's like, hey, these are your new voters, shut up.
[00:51:17.780 --> 00:51:25.900]  And so Biden now wants to keep them in Texas and under federal orders.
[00:51:26.130 --> 00:51:31.370]  He legally brings them in, tells them, come here, gives them all this money and says,
[00:51:31.370 --> 00:51:35.650]  now you got to stay in Texas.
[00:51:35.650 --> 00:51:36.650]  Texas is what?
[00:51:36.650 --> 00:51:37.650]  30 million people?
[00:51:37.650 --> 00:51:38.650]  What's the population of Texas?
[00:51:38.650 --> 00:51:39.650]  Guys, look at it for me.
[00:51:39.650 --> 00:51:45.730]  I mean, being in Texas, I'd say 10 million are illegal aliens in Texas alone.
[00:51:45.730 --> 00:51:48.850]  I mean, there's probably 4 million in Houston.
[00:51:48.850 --> 00:51:52.690]  Now most of them have gone and gotten a job and they want to have kids and have a life
[00:51:52.690 --> 00:51:55.610]  in a swimming pool and they're actually great people.
[00:51:55.610 --> 00:52:00.590]  But those are the folks that have been here for decades and have assimilated.
[00:52:00.590 --> 00:52:05.210]  The new ones are from all over the world and a lot of them are mentally ill or they're
[00:52:05.210 --> 00:52:08.690]  criminals or they have no skills.
[00:52:08.690 --> 00:52:11.730]  They're like dumping their mental institutions out on us.
[00:52:11.730 --> 00:52:13.330]  Yep, there it is.
[00:52:13.330 --> 00:52:14.970]  I guessed it right from memory.
[00:52:14.970 --> 00:52:18.130]  30 million, at least 10 million are illegal.
[00:52:18.130 --> 00:52:23.210]  Well, I mean, if they're bringing in 5 to 10 million, that's what's very, most are
[00:52:23.210 --> 00:52:28.970]  about 6 million a year and they want to keep them all in Texas, well, Texas will be 36
[00:52:28.970 --> 00:52:33.490]  million then in a year and there's their voting block because they're only, Democrats
[00:52:33.490 --> 00:52:37.370]  are losing by about two points here, two points.
[00:52:37.370 --> 00:52:42.450]  They've already, of state control, they've already gotten all the cities, San Antonio,
[00:52:42.450 --> 00:52:50.610]  Houston, Dallas, Austin, El Paso, they got control folks and these illegals do what
[00:52:50.610 --> 00:52:56.050]  they're told because they're under the control with a cell phone the government gave them
[00:52:56.050 --> 00:52:59.250]  and with a ankle bracelet.
[00:52:59.250 --> 00:53:03.890]  And then here comes the Democrat operatives and they say, okay, here's the name of the
[00:53:03.890 --> 00:53:07.690]  dead person, the person that moved out of the state, they got a Facebook database
[00:53:07.690 --> 00:53:12.370]  that Zuckerberg spent 400 and something million on, 450 million, something like that,
[00:53:12.370 --> 00:53:14.610]  four to 45 million, look it up.
[00:53:14.610 --> 00:53:20.090]  On the last election, 2020, the last presidential one, spent a hundred million on the midterm.
[00:53:20.090 --> 00:53:24.690]  That's just him, databasing all the people that moved out of state or died, they create
[00:53:24.690 --> 00:53:29.210]  a role, they give it to them, they fill out the name, the illegal goes in and votes
[00:53:29.210 --> 00:53:33.170]  or they put it in the drop box.
[00:53:33.170 --> 00:53:39.770]  And that's their plan, so California says they're going to arrest the Texas governor
[00:53:39.770 --> 00:53:44.010]  for shipping a few buses to California.
[00:53:44.010 --> 00:53:48.170]  These people are sick.
[00:53:48.170 --> 00:53:51.050]  Here is the New York mayor.
[00:53:51.050 --> 00:53:57.530]  Started with a madman down in Texas decided he wanted to bus people up to New York City.
[00:53:57.530 --> 00:53:59.530]  110-
[00:53:59.530 --> 00:54:01.010]  It paused, it paused.
[00:54:01.010 --> 00:54:02.490]  Back it up and start again.
[00:54:02.490 --> 00:54:08.330]  It started with a madman in Texas that decided he'd bus some people here.
[00:54:08.330 --> 00:54:13.130]  Most of the illegals are already going there because it has the biggest welfare check, dummy.
[00:54:13.130 --> 00:54:20.410]  New York State's giving them 10 grand or $10,100 a month.
[00:54:20.410 --> 00:54:24.730]  Hell I might say I'm an illegal alien, just go up there.
[00:54:24.730 --> 00:54:27.370]  They give them driver's license, they let them vote.
[00:54:27.370 --> 00:54:31.690]  Hell in Illinois they can be cops, in New Mexico they can be cops.
[00:54:31.690 --> 00:54:35.250]  It started with the lockdowns in the third world, it started with the UN organizing
[00:54:35.250 --> 00:54:38.850]  them, it started with the UN refugee centers, it started with Biden saying come here,
[00:54:38.850 --> 00:54:41.570]  it started with them getting rid of the border wall.
[00:54:41.570 --> 00:54:48.290]  It started with them putting ice under the control of NGOs, of the UN.
[00:54:48.290 --> 00:54:56.810]  It didn't start with a madman in Texas, the governor, who is milquetoast and weak
[00:54:56.810 --> 00:54:59.410]  compared to people like Trump.
[00:54:59.410 --> 00:55:05.250]  And I'll take Abbott, I'm not saying he's evil, I'm just saying he's weak.
[00:55:05.250 --> 00:55:08.770]  Abbott got a giant settlement for a tree that fell on him, one of the biggest in
[00:55:08.770 --> 00:55:12.250]  history, and then he passed tort reform right after it.
[00:55:12.250 --> 00:55:14.650]  Which by the way, I think we need tort reform and cap some things.
[00:55:14.650 --> 00:55:18.650]  But the point is, is the man is a joke.
[00:55:18.650 --> 00:55:23.290]  But I'm not going to go into that now, the point is he's a hypocrite.
[00:55:23.290 --> 00:55:25.210]  But he's nothing compared to these people.
[00:55:25.210 --> 00:55:29.490]  So let's go back to this BS artist.
[00:55:29.490 --> 00:55:38.490]  I regret getting started with a madman down in Texas decided he wanted to bus people
[00:55:38.490 --> 00:55:40.930]  up to New York City.
[00:55:40.930 --> 00:55:52.250]  110,000 migrants with the feed, clothes, house, educate the children, watch their
[00:55:52.250 --> 00:55:57.490]  laundry sheets, give them everything they need, healthcare.
[00:55:57.490 --> 00:56:03.850]  And this team here, we stated, let's do everything possible before we have to push it out into
[00:56:03.850 --> 00:56:05.970]  neighborhoods and communities.
[00:56:05.970 --> 00:56:09.490]  Month after month, I stood up and I said, this is going to come to a neighborhood near
[00:56:09.490 --> 00:56:10.490]  you.
[00:56:10.490 --> 00:56:13.250]  Well, we're here.
[00:56:13.250 --> 00:56:14.370]  We're here.
[00:56:14.370 --> 00:56:20.970]  We're getting no support on this national crisis.
[00:56:20.970 --> 00:56:22.650]  And we're receiving no support.
[00:56:22.650 --> 00:56:30.010]  And let me tell you something, New Yorkers, never in my life have I had a problem that
[00:56:30.010 --> 00:56:32.810]  I did not see an ending to.
[00:56:32.810 --> 00:56:35.570]  I don't see an ending to this.
[00:56:35.570 --> 00:56:37.970]  I don't see an ending to this.
[00:56:37.970 --> 00:56:45.170]  This issue will destroy New York City, destroy New York City.
[00:56:45.170 --> 00:56:51.410]  We're getting 10,000 migrants a month.
[00:56:51.410 --> 00:56:54.570]  One time we were just getting Venezuela.
[00:56:54.570 --> 00:56:56.290]  Now we're getting Ecuador.
[00:56:56.290 --> 00:56:59.010]  Now we're getting Russian speaking coming through Mexico.
[00:56:59.010 --> 00:57:01.650]  Now we're getting Western Africa.
[00:57:01.650 --> 00:57:05.250]  Now we're getting people from all over the globe have made their minds up that they're
[00:57:05.250 --> 00:57:10.850]  going to come through the southern part of the border and come into New York City.
[00:57:10.850 --> 00:57:15.610]  And everyone is saying it's New York City's problem.
[00:57:15.610 --> 00:57:18.650]  Every community in this city is going to be impacted.
[00:57:19.450 --> 00:57:20.450]  This is so incredible.
[00:57:20.450 --> 00:57:25.850]  His party does all this and then he blames Texas.
[00:57:25.850 --> 00:57:30.250]  Wow.
[00:57:30.250 --> 00:57:33.690]  It's like Democrats collapse their states and then move to our states.
[00:57:33.690 --> 00:57:35.810]  It's like, it's incredible.
[00:57:35.810 --> 00:57:39.850]  Hey, mayor, hey, governor's there.

[00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:06.000]  Alright, we're going to get into the new COVID lockdowns that are now official and how to stop them,
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:12.000]  the latest World War III news and more, but first I want to play a clip that I'll get more to in the next segment of RFK Jr.,
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:17.000]  because the Democrats are officially blocking him out of the process.
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:27.000]  No debates, trying to block him from the process of being in the states, the primaries.
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:31.000]  This is total election meddling, here it is.
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:36.000]  It's pretty clear that the DNC does not want a primary.
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:51.000]  They, you know, I don't want to say that they want a coronation, but that's, I think that that's a fair way to put it actually.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:01:03.000]  They're doing, they're, essentially they're fixing the process so that it makes it almost impossible to have democracy function.
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:16.000]  They're effectively disenfranchising the Democratic voters from having any choice in who becomes president, who becomes the Democratic nominee.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:28.000]  So two of the things they've done today is they've moved the Iowa primary, they've made rules that if anybody campaigns in Iowa
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:34.000]  or any candidate that's put in the state of Iowa or that's put in the state of New Hampshire,
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:41.000]  that none of the votes that are cast for that candidate will be tallied.
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:49.000]  In other words, any delegate that I win in New Hampshire or Iowa would go instead to the president.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:02:00.000]  And now they're trying to change it so that if I campaign in New Hampshire, that none of the votes cast for me in Georgia will count.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:05.000]  That's significant because it's hard to win the nomination without Georgia.
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:08.000]  What is the logic?
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:17.000]  Well, they're rigging it so that it, you know, effectively, you know, we're looking at the tabulations now that look like I,
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:27.000]  if you add up all the superdelegates that they control and all of the automatic delegates that just go to the party and go to the president,
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:39.000]  you know, I would have to win almost 80% of all of the states in order to beat President Biden, even if he only wins 20%.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:49.000]  And yet you continue on. So what is your strategy then in light of this for defeating President Biden?
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:59.000]  You know, these rules will not be finalized until September 14th. And we've written the DNC protesting.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:08.000]  I mean, there's some really wild things that they're now considering, including forcing me to actually pay for the primaries.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:15.000]  And their logic is that they don't need a primary because they already have a candidate.
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:25.000]  And therefore, I'm costing them all this money and that money should be paid for by me and, you know, maybe Marianne Williamson.
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:30.000]  So it's not, you know, it's a process that is rigged.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:39.000]  You know, we live at a time in American history when a lot of Americans think that democracy is broken,
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:46.000]  that the system, the political system is rigged and that there's not really any democracy.
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:54.000]  And unfortunately, the DNC is taking a lot of steps that confirm that outlook.
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:04:07.000]  If the decision holds for the current, you know, sort of primary structure with the DNC, what is the best, what is the route to victory for you against President Biden?
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:20.000]  You know, if the DNC is going to rig it so that it is simply impossible for anybody to challenge President Biden,
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:28.000]  then, you know, I need to look at other alternatives because I can't go back to the people who support me and to my donors and say,
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:35.000]  you know, I'm in this to make a point. I need to show them a road to victory.
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:38.000]  What kind of alternatives would you be exploring, Mr. Kennedy?
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:44.000]  Well, you know, I don't know exactly because I want to see what the DNC does.
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:49.000]  I want to see if they make it, if they, you know, if they make it a fair contest.
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:59.000]  And, you know, I'm not asking that it be 100 percent fair, but I'm asking that there at least be, you know, a chance that it be plausible.
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:04.000]  All right. Please remember, we're a list for support and we can't fund our operation without you.

[01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.000]  You're doing a great job.
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:24.000]  It's the Alex Jones Show with Alex Jones.
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:28.000]  It's Friday, September 8th, 2023.
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.000]  Around hour number two.
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000]  Very blessed and honored to be here.
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:35.000]  I want to thank you all again for commissioning me in this fight.
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:38.000]  You're the reason we've had all this success together.
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:44.000]  So don't forget how important you are and how much I appreciate you.
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:47.000]  As dark as the days are and as hard as the fight is,
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:53.000]  I know you've got my back and I am very humbly thankful to you.
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:56.000]  From the bottom of my heart.
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:59.000]  And the core of my soul.
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:02.000]  I appreciate you and I love you.
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.000]  All right.
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:06.000]  Look, I didn't want to be right about this,
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:09.000]  but obviously I don't just make up whistleblowers.
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:12.000]  I don't make up information.
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:15.000]  I get things wrong sometimes or the global has changed course
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000]  and then people say I was wrong.
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:20.000]  But I knew 18, 19 days ago when I got on air and said,
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000]  I've talked to multiple whistleblowers.
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:26.000]  Well, technically one whistleblower I call the other people.
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:29.000]  And said, hey, they're going to roll out the COVID protocol,
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:32.000]  the COVID tyranny again.
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000]  That it was happening.
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:37.000]  And basically immediately they launched their operation.
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000]  It was all pre-planned.
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:40.000]  I was told middle of September,
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:43.000]  but I guess it was a drumbeat rollout up to that.
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:46.000]  So think about all the things that that entails.
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:50.000]  Think about the mask and the small businesses shut down
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.000]  and the pushing the poison shots and the ventilators
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000]  and not letting families see their family members
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:08:01.000]  and the third world collapsing further.
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:05.000]  Think about what that signifies, what that means.
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000]  And now if I tried to play all these clips,
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.000]  it would take the rest of the show.
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.000]  You see it.
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.000]  It's everywhere.
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000]  The UN saying, oh, it's worse than we thought.
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000]  We need new protocols and control again
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000]  and the tools we had before.
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000]  The White House saying, hey, we're going back the way it was.
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000]  It never changed.
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000]  They're not saying the protocols are back.
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000]  They're saying they never left.
[01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:30.599]  And it goes on and on and on.
[01:08:30.599 --> 01:08:34.760]  So what is the point then of opposing it?
[01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:40.420]  Well because we're not going to just sit here flat-footed as I've said and not point
[01:08:40.420 --> 01:08:46.880]  out all the lies of Fauci, all the lies of the CDC and the FDA and the suppression of
[01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:52.920]  therapeutics and all the terrible things they did and the toxic shots and the 20 million
[01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:56.040]  dead and just all the rest of it.
[01:08:56.040 --> 01:09:04.000]  But the good news is without even looking for the news, I can't go anywhere without political
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:11.760]  cartoons and news articles and even CNN skewering, impaling Fauci a few days ago.
[01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:16.960]  We didn't play the clip because I just can't stand to even watch CNN but there was a clip
[01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:23.360]  on Infowars where Shmerkhanesh just says, well the studies say masks don't work.
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:26.800]  Here they are, here they are, here they are and you said before they didn't work four
[01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:30.300]  years ago, three years ago but now you say they do and we need them again.
[01:09:30.300 --> 01:09:32.160]  You're full of crap.
[01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:38.160]  What does that signify when CNN, it's not just that one show, is saying this is BS.
[01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:39.960]  People know it's hurting children.
[01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:42.059]  People know it's destroying the economy.
[01:09:42.059 --> 01:09:45.480]  People know and you can see in the eyes of these talk show hosts, they'll probably get
[01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:49.960]  fired for it but they're sick of it.
[01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:55.440]  And we just did like the nurses and military people that quit and said no up front, enough
[01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:57.760]  of us, their system will grind to a halt.
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:02.360]  They don't care if some get purged but they need main compliance.
[01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:04.920]  So this is the time to say no.
[01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:10.179]  So I'll officially declare today, obviously our whistleblower was right and I don't see
[01:10:10.179 --> 01:10:16.900]  them changing course so the 15th is in seven days and I would expect as they're so arrogant
[01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:22.820]  the TSA will remask on the 15th and by the middle of October Biden will try a masking
[01:10:22.820 --> 01:10:29.900]  order via any federally controlled transportation system like flights and the nurses will be
[01:10:29.900 --> 01:10:39.420]  back dancing and the whole nine yards and I wish that wasn't the case but it's not
[01:10:39.420 --> 01:10:44.300]  an at least, because this is not an at least, this really messed them up.
[01:10:44.300 --> 01:10:51.219]  I've been on there 29 years and I got to tell you, I think this of everything we've
[01:10:51.219 --> 01:10:59.639]  done, 9-11 was big to expose, Bohemian Grove was big to expose, I mean there's hundreds
[01:10:59.639 --> 01:11:04.700]  of big stories that we've been really effective in at changing the paradigm and waking
[01:11:04.700 --> 01:11:05.700]  people.
[01:11:05.700 --> 01:11:13.460]  I've got to say, listeners getting excited about this two and a half weeks ago or I guess
[01:11:13.460 --> 01:11:18.940]  wait a minute, it's Friday, I keep saying two and a half weeks ago, three weeks ago,
[01:11:18.940 --> 01:11:25.740]  sorry, sorry, I got that wrong, three weeks ago, this is such an illustrative event,
[01:11:25.740 --> 01:11:32.340]  this is such a learning moment for all of us, you got excited, I was theatrical which
[01:11:32.340 --> 01:11:38.620]  I don't tend to do, I come out of the show, I come into the show with the most hardcore
[01:11:38.620 --> 01:11:42.760]  stuff, I don't say hey, tune in later, we're going to cover this, it's really big,
[01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:47.219]  I just inherently don't do that, I should do more of that, because humans are what
[01:11:47.219 --> 01:11:50.660]  humans are and I'm the same way, I'm watching some show and they go, next hour
[01:11:50.660 --> 01:11:55.139]  it's really big, tell everybody you know, tune in now, I'm like yeah, tune in, this
[01:11:55.139 --> 01:12:00.219]  is about to be big, Tucker is going to have Obama's boyfriend on tonight, that's what
[01:12:00.219 --> 01:12:03.500]  promos are about, that's what trailers are about, that's why they put trailers on TV
[01:12:03.500 --> 01:12:09.740]  for a new movie coming out or put ads on about a new truck coming out or a new system
[01:12:09.740 --> 01:12:14.120]  of golf clubs or whatever they're selling, well I'm selling truth and justice and freedom
[01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:20.260]  and resistance, so I just want to thank the audience just like I just did because
[01:12:20.260 --> 01:12:24.860]  I mean you're everything, I mean you need to get it straight, I'm the tail, you're
[01:12:24.860 --> 01:12:31.179]  the dog, not oh thank you Alex, you're so great, no, when you decide, I'm just like
[01:12:31.179 --> 01:12:39.179]  you, I want freedom, I'm not that special, when you decide, it's about you, and I know
[01:12:39.179 --> 01:12:42.139]  I'm hammering this point probably too much for most of you, you get it, but I want
[01:12:42.139 --> 01:12:47.580]  people that are not fully conscious of this to understand, it's about you, it's
[01:12:47.580 --> 01:12:55.860]  about you, it's about you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you,
[01:12:55.860 --> 01:13:02.460]  you have the power, you have the will, you together can do anything, you, you, you,
[01:13:02.460 --> 01:13:06.260]  you, you, you, you, you, you, and I'm being obnoxious, so I'm going to go you, you,
[01:13:06.260 --> 01:13:09.260]  you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you,
[01:13:09.260 --> 01:13:14.260]  you, you, you, you, you, you, I'm going to do 100 you's, you, you, you, you,
[01:13:14.940 --> 01:13:21.219]  you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, I know it's super obnoxious
[01:13:21.219 --> 01:13:27.940]  but get it through your head, like I love Robeter Death, one of my best friends
[01:13:27.940 --> 01:13:32.580]  worked like 18 hours yesterday to put out this 2.5 hour report we shot
[01:13:32.580 --> 01:13:35.580]  that's at JonesCrotter.com right now and the whole Global's Takeover plan
[01:13:35.580 --> 01:13:39.580]  and the Mad Scientist program and how to stop him, but once
[01:13:39.580 --> 01:13:43.580]  you're not in the habit of doing something, you don't do it, so yesterday
[01:13:43.580 --> 01:13:48.040]  I said hey when you're done with the trailer, and you're done with it. Make sure it's in the computer this morning
[01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:50.300]  So I can play it I come in I go hey
[01:13:50.300 --> 01:13:56.880]  Did you put the trailer in the computer what trailer go get the trailer when was the trailer done hours ago?
[01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:58.320]  I stayed up all night
[01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:00.460]  Okay, that's the final part of it
[01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:02.480]  It's like having a nine-month
[01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:06.519]  You know pregnancy woman, and then you said her having the baby you abort it
[01:14:06.599 --> 01:14:11.120]  You've got to put it in the computer so we know it's there to play it, and I'm not bitching
[01:14:11.260 --> 01:14:13.420]  I'm using that as an analogy of
[01:14:14.740 --> 01:14:16.620]  you
[01:14:16.620 --> 01:14:18.620]  just like
[01:14:19.179 --> 01:14:26.860]  We don't think to actually actually put out what we make it's important to put out what we make that's like 90% of it
[01:14:28.300 --> 01:14:34.300]  It's important. This is my pet peeve. I blew up yesterday about this they made these clubs these great reports
[01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:36.219]  I was like where are they oh?
[01:14:36.219 --> 01:14:38.219]  They're not in the computer
[01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:44.880]  That's a side issue what I'm and I'm not complaining. I'm saying it's an analogy or it's a parallel. It's a it's it's it's it's it's a factoid
[01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:51.760]  Listeners think like oh, it's Alex Jones or Rand Paul or Senator Hawley or
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:54.400]  Donald Trump's gonna save us no folks
[01:14:54.960 --> 01:15:00.920]  It's you going to the City Council and the school board. It's you filing suit against the leftist group
[01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:06.240]  It's you protesting. It's you financially supporting. It's you praying. It's you spending time with your family
[01:15:06.260 --> 01:15:07.820]  It's you breaking with the system
[01:15:07.820 --> 01:15:13.820]  It's you never going to another big Hollywood movie again unless you're going to review it and attack it I
[01:15:17.420 --> 01:15:20.559]  Used to go see movies every week one of my favorite things growing up my dad
[01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:25.700]  Was a hard-working guy, but he would always cut time out to you know do things for me
[01:15:25.700 --> 01:15:28.700]  or take me camping or hunting or water skiing or
[01:15:29.380 --> 01:15:31.380]  wakeboarding
[01:15:31.420 --> 01:15:33.940]  Skip this break. Sorry. I told you late and
[01:15:36.660 --> 01:15:38.660]  I forget what I was gonna say, but
[01:15:40.340 --> 01:15:42.340]  The point is is that
[01:15:45.219 --> 01:15:49.460]  What was I saying about my dad how was I going off a story about it spending and being busy
[01:15:49.460 --> 01:15:51.460]  But still spending time with me
[01:15:51.580 --> 01:15:53.580]  How does matter?
[01:15:54.840 --> 01:15:56.940]  The point here is that
[01:16:02.540 --> 01:16:04.540]  We have to do this
[01:16:06.260 --> 01:16:09.260]  And things are only gonna get worse if we don't do this
[01:16:10.940 --> 01:16:12.940]  And I sit back
[01:16:13.900 --> 01:16:17.940]  And I look at the insurance actuarial numbers, they're the most accurate numbers out there
[01:16:18.860 --> 01:16:22.700]  So insurance companies make decisions on there. They're they're like 99% accurate
[01:16:24.179 --> 01:16:28.460]  On how long does a smoker live that's a certain group that has this diet
[01:16:28.460 --> 01:16:32.420]  I mean they know down to statistically to the day you're gonna die basically and
[01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:37.000]  Their numbers are 44 percent increase in death in every country that took the shot
[01:16:37.559 --> 01:16:41.679]  44 percent increase on the previous death number
[01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:45.200]  And I just sit back and I go man
[01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:50.800]  Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab in the UN and the Pentagon people running it
[01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:54.599]  It got balls the size of Jupiter I
[01:16:55.599 --> 01:17:00.160]  Mean that's crazy, but you know why they did it they understand psychology
[01:17:01.019 --> 01:17:05.099]  How do you even get your mind around they just killed 20 million people
[01:17:05.820 --> 01:17:07.820]  That's what the numbers are on the shots. I
[01:17:08.580 --> 01:17:10.580]  Mean that's pretty wicked
[01:17:14.900 --> 01:17:20.900]  But Zelensky got caught shooting missiles last year into Poland and called for nuclear war and said the Russians did it
[01:17:20.900 --> 01:17:24.820]  That's crazy too, and the point is it's not that Zelensky's bad. He is
[01:17:25.660 --> 01:17:27.700]  It's not that Bill Gates is bad. He is
[01:17:30.299 --> 01:17:33.180]  It's that we have not restrained these psychotics
[01:17:36.340 --> 01:17:42.500]  And that's the most important thing I want to say here today is of
[01:17:44.099 --> 01:17:45.340]  Course
[01:17:45.340 --> 01:17:50.500]  Almost everybody that isn't pure evil is gonna join us because it's gonna become blaringly obvious
[01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:55.500]  It already has that we are up the creek right now, and that we got lunatics
[01:17:56.019 --> 01:17:58.180]  People that make Hitler look like a choir boy
[01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:02.639]  Running things and it's because
[01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:06.080]  They're weak and
[01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:12.480]  they've never really done anything in their life other than join the power structure and the power structure only wants ruthlessness and
[01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:19.080]  Subservience, but they themselves can't even see how they're destroying their own futures
[01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:24.200]  But they get this thrill feeling like
[01:18:24.340 --> 01:18:26.340]  They're
[01:18:26.940 --> 01:18:28.940]  Part of the club
[01:18:29.540 --> 01:18:31.540]  And
[01:18:32.059 --> 01:18:36.820]  It's that wanting to belong thing that gets all these followers to join them
[01:18:36.860 --> 01:18:43.940]  That's why they don't want conservatives or Christians or or nationalists or capitalists or just pro human folks pro
[01:18:43.940 --> 01:18:49.580]  God people to have publications or have websites or have news because they want you to fill all alone and
[01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:54.960]  They want to make the cool club Hollywood they want to make the cool club the New World Order
[01:18:54.960 --> 01:19:00.320]  They want to make the cool club their agenda to get all these idiots to get on board with it
[01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:08.440]  So that's where we are
[01:19:10.519 --> 01:19:15.000]  But I look at this news and I'll get to the vaccine news which is a vaccine in a moment
[01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:18.160]  But just look at this article
[01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:20.420]  This is wild
[01:19:22.099 --> 01:19:24.099]  Remember that crazy witch lady that
[01:19:24.740 --> 01:19:27.900]  Was on TV the form of the grand jury in Fulton County, Georgia
[01:19:28.660 --> 01:19:30.820]  And she's she is a witch on her own website
[01:19:31.780 --> 01:19:33.780]  and she says I
[01:19:34.099 --> 01:19:36.540]  Just felt powerful having Trump under my control
[01:19:37.960 --> 01:19:40.780]  She's a totally disconnected lunatic
[01:19:40.780 --> 01:19:42.780]  Who
[01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:48.480]  Has no shame and has no idea what she's involved in and now we learn
[01:19:49.519 --> 01:19:51.639]  that she wanted to indict a
[01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:57.480]  Bunch of Republican senators remember the Democrats, but they told her to do this they try to get it to happen
[01:19:58.320 --> 01:20:03.320]  Remember they said Ted Cruz should be expelled from the Senate because he was at the Capitol on January 6
[01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:05.320]  And he wanted a 10-day investigation that's in the law
[01:20:05.799 --> 01:20:10.000]  They wanted Marjorie Taylor Greene expelled they went to court tried to bar her from running for office
[01:20:10.139 --> 01:20:12.139]  remember that last year and
[01:20:13.980 --> 01:20:18.840]  So now it comes out in documents and the and the grand jury forewoman
[01:20:19.980 --> 01:20:21.980]  Is bragging?
[01:20:22.019 --> 01:20:26.380]  Well, we almost got Lindsey Graham Lindsey Graham's a Georgian pro-war
[01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:28.740]  psychotic neo-con
[01:20:28.740 --> 01:20:33.900]  But because he's got an hour before his name these Democrats don't even know he's in their club
[01:20:34.019 --> 01:20:37.059]  He's one of their top people. He's one of their generals
[01:20:37.660 --> 01:20:39.660]  He's a made man
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:46.320]  And they wanted him indicted along with Ted Cruz and everybody else and by the way, they'll do that later
[01:20:46.719 --> 01:20:50.980]  They want a one party system. You know I keep saying I'm gonna play it again
[01:20:50.980 --> 01:20:56.580]  I played like a month ago get the Josh Hawley minute-and-a-half clip left Senator Cali Senator Cali
[01:20:57.700 --> 01:21:03.460]  Where he explains this is a one-party system or outlawing their opposition. They're setting up a totalitarian system folks
[01:21:03.460 --> 01:21:07.860]  That's not somebody blowing smoke at you. That's really happening
[01:21:10.059 --> 01:21:12.059]  That's really going on
[01:21:14.260 --> 01:21:15.700]  And
[01:21:15.700 --> 01:21:21.460]  Then you look at this lunatic woman. She's like the woman that said Trump raped her 25 years ago
[01:21:22.139 --> 01:21:23.660]  and
[01:21:23.660 --> 01:21:28.820]  Trump says I don't know you and so they can't convict him of rape so they get him for defamation
[01:21:29.580 --> 01:21:34.299]  $5,000,000 and she has another civil trial coming up. They passed laws let her do it
[01:21:35.219 --> 01:21:38.139]  statute limitations got rid of that and
[01:21:40.139 --> 01:21:47.180]  She goes with Anderson Cooper. She goes rapes really hot women love it. You're really sexy. He's like all creeped out goes to commercial
[01:21:48.620 --> 01:21:53.519]  You can look the woman up online. She's a complete stark raving mad lunatic
[01:21:55.299 --> 01:22:02.340]  But that's who these people are and we're letting the stark raving mad lunatics like the woman was gonna run the Ministry of Truth
[01:22:02.340 --> 01:22:03.260]  They already had it set up
[01:22:03.260 --> 01:22:09.340]  It was gonna be officially launched seeing Little Mermaid songs about how she's gonna destroy the Republicans. They have no
[01:22:10.900 --> 01:22:18.260]  Depth they have no sense of how idiotic they are. They have no sense of the world. They're bringing us into
[01:22:20.180 --> 01:22:22.180]  Yeah, look at these people
[01:22:24.980 --> 01:22:28.219]  They didn't believe Paula Jones they didn't believe Tara Reid
[01:22:29.059 --> 01:22:31.059]  They didn't believe Larry Sinclair
[01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:34.019]  They believed he Jean Carroll
[01:22:34.900 --> 01:22:36.900]  Look at that woman
[01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:44.920]  By she looks like that New York Times reporter that's always making something about me. Well, it's her name. I forget. Is that her sister?
[01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:52.320]  No witnesses no report 25 years later. He grabbed me
[01:22:54.400 --> 01:23:01.639]  In a closing in a clothing changing room and all Trump was said I'm innocent. I don't know that woman
[01:23:02.620 --> 01:23:07.820]  Defamation how dare you say you didn't do that five million dollars
[01:23:09.660 --> 01:23:11.660]  Then we have the Georgia lunatic
[01:23:12.260 --> 01:23:14.860]  Georgia grand jury went insane close quote
[01:23:15.260 --> 01:23:20.740]  Targeted Lindsey Graham and 38 others over j6 the Georgia grand jury whose lunatic for woman came under fire
[01:23:21.099 --> 01:23:29.420]  February she went on national TV giddy with excitement and foreshadowing the coming indictments against former President Donald Trump at 18 other defendants
[01:23:31.660 --> 01:23:33.580]  She went absolutely insane
[01:23:33.580 --> 01:23:34.940]  with indictment
[01:23:34.940 --> 01:23:40.860]  Recommendations it turns out the grand jury actually recommended charges against 39 people including two u.s. Senators
[01:23:41.540 --> 01:23:42.980]  for Georgia
[01:23:42.980 --> 01:23:44.360]  David Perdue
[01:23:44.360 --> 01:23:48.340]  Kelly law familiar and others current u.s. Senator Lindsey Graham
[01:23:50.860 --> 01:23:53.740]  Republicans, health carolina georgia secretary of state
[01:23:54.719 --> 01:23:56.719]  Raphkin burger said
[01:23:56.920 --> 01:24:03.080]  Called him at between three election to ask if it was possible to invalidate mail-in ballots totally legal
[01:24:03.639 --> 01:24:08.120]  But she wanted all these other people indicted. I mean, why not?
[01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:15.340]  They already put thousand plus people in jail most up nonviolent from the Capitol. It's all about excess
[01:24:15.340 --> 01:24:19.680]  It's like when the when the when the jury when I was already found guilty by the judge
[01:24:20.620 --> 01:24:22.620]  In
[01:24:22.820 --> 01:24:24.180]  Connecticut
[01:24:24.180 --> 01:24:28.299]  They said okay one point five billion dollars Alex Jones has to pay
[01:24:28.299 --> 01:24:32.219]  it's a big crazy number and they went hold my beer and
[01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:38.820]  The and the litigators the the the the the Democrat law firm senator one Blumenthal
[01:24:39.900 --> 01:24:41.900]  they put in a
[01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:48.940]  Recommendation of two point seven five trillion and I tell people that they go that's not true you search
[01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:51.920]  Alex Jones seven point
[01:24:53.799 --> 01:24:58.120]  Seven point five seven point six five trillion what whatever it is guys type it in
[01:24:58.480 --> 01:25:00.480]  It's in Bloomberg. It was in the news
[01:25:00.519 --> 01:25:03.840]  No, I mean and and then they figured out that that was crazy
[01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:07.440]  So they kind of pulled it back in about a week and change the headlines. We have copies of them all
[01:25:08.719 --> 01:25:12.880]  that's the GDP of India folks a billion to five hundred million people a
[01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:16.960]  Billion five hundred million people
[01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:22.980]  Live off of that that's their GDP and they're saying
[01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:27.799]  We want the GDP of India
[01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:34.599]  For somebody we made up all this stuff about he never even said
[01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:38.280]  but the things they claimed I said were protected on the First Amendment and
[01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:45.200]  So you have to let that sink in that like there's no limit imagine going to the judge and saying here
[01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:48.000]  It is Connecticut judge asked for two point seven five
[01:25:48.940 --> 01:25:50.740]  trillion more
[01:25:50.740 --> 01:25:52.740]  the Sandy Hook families
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:55.360]  But that's
[01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:56.960]  That's what they introduced
[01:25:56.960 --> 01:26:04.240]  They said we want two point seven five trillion to create the illusion that I have more money than the entire
[01:26:04.440 --> 01:26:06.440]  Indian economy or
[01:26:06.639 --> 01:26:08.519]  France
[01:26:08.519 --> 01:26:12.760]  Well at the time they published that I had two million dollars in the bank now, I have basically nothing
[01:26:13.700 --> 01:26:21.460]  But again, it's it's they can't help the over-the-topness they can't help but just go as wild as possible
[01:26:22.700 --> 01:26:26.260]  Two men can have a baby Alex Jones could pay two point seven five trillion
[01:26:26.620 --> 01:26:31.920]  The Easter Bunny is real the tooth fairy is real Santa Claus is real Count Dracula is real
[01:26:33.019 --> 01:26:35.019]  Flying pigs are real
[01:26:35.940 --> 01:26:37.940]  Keebler elves are real
[01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:40.400]  Blackness monsters real
[01:26:40.599 --> 01:26:43.680]  Two men can have a baby two women in prison can have a baby
[01:26:44.559 --> 01:26:48.880]  Alex Jones peed on children's graves never did that never told anybody nobody ever did it doesn't matter
[01:26:48.880 --> 01:26:53.200]  We just say it. We just do what we want. We just giggle and laugh. It's so much fun
[01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:59.200]  We start war with Russia. We have nuclear war we all die. We're trendy ha ha ha ha ha ha it's so much fun
[01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:06.680]  All right, I'm gonna segue because I said I'd hit the cup of deuce and it's massive
[01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:08.680]  We have special guests from Hawaii
[01:27:09.059 --> 01:27:15.200]  There's an emergency worker very well-known emergency manager and he's been there. He lives there, but he's been there throughout the whole deal
[01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:18.160]  He's ready to come on and give an analysis of what really happened
[01:27:18.160 --> 01:27:22.420]  we're not gonna forget about the people of Laina Laina the people of Maui and
[01:27:23.299 --> 01:27:24.580]  We're gonna
[01:27:24.580 --> 01:27:26.580]  Go over all that as well
[01:27:26.860 --> 01:27:28.860]  But then you've got articles like this one
[01:27:29.500 --> 01:27:33.420]  California wants to go all-electric without having the ability to actually provide enough electricity
[01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:35.719]  California
[01:27:35.719 --> 01:27:41.680]  By estimates by 2030 won't have enough renewable energy to power 20% electric cars
[01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:50.400]  But they don't care they want them all to be electric cars because again why it's nonsensical. It's crazy. It's grandeur
[01:27:52.599 --> 01:27:59.240]  Bill Gates for 20 years says I've got programs spraying out of airplanes with the Department of Energy to block out the Sun
[01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:03.740]  We go, here's the meeting. Here's the CIA briefing on c-span. We'd have a debate about this and stop this
[01:28:03.740 --> 01:28:09.820]  It doesn't exist New York Times. There's no geoengineering. No chemtrailing. Then Bill Gates says I want to block the Sun out with a
[01:28:10.340 --> 01:28:15.260]  Rays that we put out close to the Sun with mirrors because you can have a tiny dot out here
[01:28:15.260 --> 01:28:17.380]  But it blocks a lot more light over here
[01:28:18.380 --> 01:28:19.900]  and
[01:28:19.900 --> 01:28:23.820]  Then Biden two months ago says yeah, we're gonna spend billions on blocking the Sun out
[01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:30.040]  Now I know I sounded crazy 20 years ago telling you Bill Gates wanted to do that now it's here folks you're like
[01:28:30.799 --> 01:28:32.960]  2.75 trillion Alex Jones needs to pay
[01:28:33.719 --> 01:28:40.080]  For things you didn't do. Oh, let's block the Sun out. Oh, let's cut trees down to save the earth now CNN
[01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:41.400]  You're like, that's so crazy

[01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:07.680]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:07.710 --> 01:33:26.070]  This is a message, they're trying to send a message loud and clear, and the message
[01:33:26.070 --> 01:33:27.270]  is don't mess with us.
[01:33:27.270 --> 01:33:28.490]  And why are they going after Trump?
[01:33:28.490 --> 01:33:29.650]  Because he messed with them.
[01:33:29.650 --> 01:33:31.050]  He challenged them across the board.
[01:33:31.050 --> 01:33:33.290]  He challenged their pro-war policies.
[01:33:33.290 --> 01:33:34.770]  He's challenged them on Ukraine.
[01:33:34.770 --> 01:33:39.170]  He's challenged their globalist agenda that's ripped off our working class for years, hollowed
[01:33:39.170 --> 01:33:44.910]  out the industrial base of this country, and made our workers in this country slaves compared
[01:33:44.910 --> 01:33:48.930]  to China and these other nations that have taken away our jobs, taken away our technology.
[01:33:48.930 --> 01:33:52.890]  Trump challenged all of that, and the message is if you challenge them on this stuff, if
[01:33:52.890 --> 01:33:57.730]  you challenge them on these policies they hold dear, they will come after you.
[01:33:57.730 --> 01:34:02.570]  If you challenge them on their pro-abortion religion, they will come after you.
[01:34:02.570 --> 01:34:04.470]  So I think the message is real clear.
[01:34:04.470 --> 01:34:05.670]  Don't challenge us.
[01:34:05.670 --> 01:34:07.750]  Don't go to work for anybody who will challenge us.
[01:34:07.750 --> 01:34:13.030]  Don't vote for Donald Trump or anybody like him, or we'll treat you as a domestic terrorist.
[01:34:13.030 --> 01:34:17.110]  And I tell you what, Laura, this is a recipe for one party rule in this country.
[01:34:17.110 --> 01:34:20.710]  If that's the case, this isn't the United States of America anymore.
[01:34:20.710 --> 01:34:22.750]  Our constitutional democracy doesn't exist anymore.
[01:34:34.470 --> 01:34:52.950]  All right, we're going to hit next segment, the persecution of Owen Stroyer.
[01:34:52.950 --> 01:34:53.950]  Let that sink in.
[01:34:53.950 --> 01:35:03.390]  Owen may be spending a year in jail, according to federal requests, starting next Tuesday
[01:35:03.390 --> 01:35:10.550]  in federal court in the district of Mordor and Surin.
[01:35:10.550 --> 01:35:20.490]  And I have the actual sentencing recommendations of the feds here where it says he's not remorseful.
[01:35:20.490 --> 01:35:21.830]  He still questions the election.
[01:35:21.830 --> 01:35:24.030]  We want jail for questioning election.
[01:35:24.030 --> 01:35:26.110]  Same things in the Trump indictments.
[01:35:26.110 --> 01:35:29.110]  That is a direct murder of the First Amendment.
[01:35:29.110 --> 01:35:34.270]  Where's the ACLU bought and paid for?
[01:35:34.270 --> 01:35:38.950]  They've gone full tyrant, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:35:38.950 --> 01:35:39.950]  And why not?
[01:35:39.950 --> 01:35:43.990]  They feel like they're insulated from tyranny themselves.
[01:35:43.990 --> 01:35:47.350]  They can do it to us all day.
[01:35:47.350 --> 01:35:52.390]  They're dumb enough to not know that's going to blow back on them, and I don't care about
[01:35:52.390 --> 01:35:53.390]  them.
[01:35:53.390 --> 01:35:56.950]  So I don't take any solace and like, oh, great, this will really hurt them later.
[01:35:56.950 --> 01:36:01.630]  I'm like, this is really bad.
[01:36:01.630 --> 01:36:09.830]  And I've used this analogy for many years, that you go to a public pool, they got to
[01:36:09.830 --> 01:36:13.970]  put so much chlorine in it because people are pissing in it.
[01:36:13.970 --> 01:36:17.990]  But if one person takes a dump in the pool, they got to shut the pool down for a couple
[01:36:17.990 --> 01:36:20.230]  days and drain it.
[01:36:20.230 --> 01:36:24.190]  And they still have that where mentally retarded kid gets in the pool, takes a big crap
[01:36:24.190 --> 01:36:26.610]  in the pool, got to close it.
[01:36:26.610 --> 01:36:30.890]  And then that's really the best analogy or parallel of the globalist.
[01:36:30.890 --> 01:36:37.970]  They literally take dumps in the pool, they poison us with atrazine and fluoride and
[01:36:37.970 --> 01:36:44.290]  GMO and all this, and then they think they're exempt, but it closes the whole pool down.
[01:36:44.290 --> 01:36:49.510]  And so I just say to the Justice Department and the CIA, you guys aren't just taking
[01:36:49.510 --> 01:36:50.630]  a crap in the pool.
[01:36:50.630 --> 01:36:59.750]  You got septic tank companies that pump septic tanks, pulling up and just filling whole pools
[01:36:59.750 --> 01:37:03.390]  full of crap, telling us it's crystal clear Caribbean water, and it's not.
[01:37:03.390 --> 01:37:07.790]  And I'm just like, why do you think you get out of this yourself?
[01:37:07.790 --> 01:37:09.150]  Why would you act like this?
[01:37:09.150 --> 01:37:13.390]  Why would you promote open borders and pedophilia and all these drugs?
[01:37:13.390 --> 01:37:17.750]  And it's because they're inherently evil, folks.
[01:37:17.750 --> 01:37:18.750]  You take one look.
[01:37:18.870 --> 01:37:24.590]  In fact, get me the Georgia-Folton County Grand Jury Cookball Lady.
[01:37:24.590 --> 01:37:25.590]  Get the footage.
[01:37:25.590 --> 01:37:29.830]  You always seem to play like a shot off a TV over the screen.
[01:37:29.830 --> 01:37:34.910]  Now there's HD ones where she starts gibbering and giggling and saying, I felt powerful.
[01:37:34.910 --> 01:37:36.570]  I wanted to see him in front of me.
[01:37:36.570 --> 01:37:38.350]  I wanted to dominate him.
[01:37:38.350 --> 01:37:45.390]  And she looks like she's auditioning to play the Wicked Witch of the West in the new
[01:37:45.390 --> 01:37:48.070]  Flying Monkey Wizard of Oz movie.
[01:37:48.190 --> 01:37:49.190]  I don't think they're remaking it.
[01:37:49.190 --> 01:37:51.270]  I'm just saying that hypothetically.
[01:37:51.270 --> 01:37:52.270]  They seem to remake everything.
[01:37:52.270 --> 01:37:53.270]  They haven't remade that.
[01:37:53.270 --> 01:37:55.950]  I mean, she's like riding her bicycle.
[01:37:55.950 --> 01:38:00.310]  I'll get your dog, your little dog, and you, too.
[01:38:00.310 --> 01:38:02.310]  I'll get you and your little dog, too.
[01:38:02.310 --> 01:38:03.950]  And she's like, why?
[01:38:03.950 --> 01:38:06.750]  Why are you such a lunatic?
[01:38:06.750 --> 01:38:11.150]  Why would you go overthrow the Ukrainian government and start attacking the Russians for eight
[01:38:11.150 --> 01:38:17.230]  years and then you wonder why they go ahead and attack you back?
[01:38:17.270 --> 01:38:20.070]  Because look how she looks on the screen.
[01:38:20.070 --> 01:38:26.070]  And remember Peter Strzok when he did all those weird demonic faces and wiggled around
[01:38:26.070 --> 01:38:30.110]  and laughed and giggled because he's a loser.
[01:38:30.110 --> 01:38:37.710]  He's a mental patient, but he loves the power of the system and he loves being protected
[01:38:37.710 --> 01:38:41.950]  to do whatever he wants, whenever he wants, however he wants.
[01:38:41.950 --> 01:38:44.030]  In fact, I'll just hit Owen now.
[01:38:44.030 --> 01:38:46.030]  Go ahead and roll the clip of this witch.
[01:38:49.030 --> 01:38:52.030]  Did you personally want to hear from the former president?
[01:38:52.030 --> 01:38:55.910]  I wanted to hear from the former president, but honestly, I kind of wanted to subpoena
[01:38:55.910 --> 01:38:58.990]  the former president because I got to swear everybody in.
[01:38:58.990 --> 01:39:03.150]  And so I thought it'd be really cool to get 60 seconds with President Trump of me
[01:39:03.150 --> 01:39:06.750]  looking at him and being like, do you solemnly swear at me getting to swear him in?
[01:39:06.750 --> 01:39:10.870]  I just thought that would be an awesome moment.
[01:39:10.870 --> 01:39:15.190]  And then he wanted to indict dozens of other leaders that had nothing to do with it because
[01:39:15.190 --> 01:39:20.270]  it made her feel powerful.
[01:39:20.270 --> 01:39:23.590]  And then there's worse clips of her.
[01:39:23.590 --> 01:39:26.090]  That's who we've got in charge.
[01:39:26.090 --> 01:39:29.510]  That lunatic right there.
[01:39:29.510 --> 01:39:32.670]  Like Sean Penn gets on TV and he goes, who says we can't use nuclear weapons?
[01:39:32.670 --> 01:39:33.670]  They're very usable.
[01:39:33.670 --> 01:39:35.710]  We should nuke Russia right now.
[01:39:35.710 --> 01:39:38.110]  We shouldn't be afraid to use nukes.
[01:39:38.350 --> 01:39:41.230]  Okay, well, Russia has two to one are nukes.
[01:39:41.230 --> 01:39:50.430]  They got a 30 submarines in the Gulf of Mexico, in the Atlantic Ocean, in the Pacific Ocean.
[01:39:50.430 --> 01:39:54.390]  And in four minutes.
[01:39:54.390 --> 01:39:59.550]  They can get an order and launch and within five minutes of that, five minutes of launch
[01:39:59.550 --> 01:40:10.270]  on average, Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego are gone.
[01:40:10.270 --> 01:40:17.390]  Shub pops up 10 miles off the Texas coast missiles launch in three minutes.
[01:40:17.390 --> 01:40:20.550]  They hit Houston in four minutes.
[01:40:20.550 --> 01:40:23.390]  They hit Dallas in three and a half minutes.
[01:40:23.390 --> 01:40:25.930]  They hit Austin in three and a half minutes.
[01:40:25.930 --> 01:40:33.570]  They hit San Antonio, Atlantic Ocean, and of course, they'll fire on up and hit the
[01:40:33.570 --> 01:40:37.890]  other cities right up to Illinois.
[01:40:37.890 --> 01:40:40.130]  That's why ICBMs come over the North Pole.
[01:40:40.130 --> 01:40:44.010]  Let's go to the Atlantic.
[01:40:44.010 --> 01:40:51.530]  They pop up 12 miles off the coast of Miami in the Gulf off the coast of our main military
[01:40:51.530 --> 01:40:53.530]  base there, Tampa.
[01:40:56.930 --> 01:41:02.210]  Within two minutes, Tampa is vaporized.
[01:41:02.210 --> 01:41:06.250]  Within two minutes, Miami is vaporized.
[01:41:06.250 --> 01:41:12.690]  Within two minutes of the missiles being launched, every major city in Florida is
[01:41:12.690 --> 01:41:13.690]  vaporized.
[01:41:13.690 --> 01:41:18.210]  Oh, but let's move on up the coast.
[01:41:18.210 --> 01:41:22.010]  Other submarines, remember, there's at least 30 of them off our coast right now, holding
[01:41:22.090 --> 01:41:36.810]  up to 20 ICBM cruise missiles, sea launch systems that go up to Mach 10 and cannot be
[01:41:36.810 --> 01:41:43.810]  shot down.
[01:41:43.810 --> 01:41:50.810]  Submarines pop up off the coast and hit Georgia, Atlanta, South Carolina, North Carolina,
[01:41:52.810 --> 01:41:56.810]  oh, and you know where the real, real attacks are going to happen.
[01:41:56.810 --> 01:42:03.810]  They got at least five submarines in the central Atlantic off the coast of New York,
[01:42:03.810 --> 01:42:17.810]  New Jersey, Maryland, D.C., Virginia, vaporized.
[01:42:17.810 --> 01:42:24.810]  And the Russians are crazy.
[01:42:24.810 --> 01:42:28.810]  And they're told they're officers on those ships.
[01:42:28.810 --> 01:42:31.310]  We believe we're going to have to let have a nuclear war.
[01:42:31.310 --> 01:42:32.310]  They're drilling.
[01:42:32.310 --> 01:42:33.310]  They're ready.
[01:42:33.310 --> 01:42:39.810]  They're 100 feet under the water right now about to come up and launch the weapon.
[01:42:39.810 --> 01:42:45.810]  But don't worry, the FBI can swagger around machine guns and beat up American citizens,
[01:42:45.810 --> 01:42:48.810]  swagger, tough guy.
[01:42:48.810 --> 01:42:55.810]  Well, they're smuggling all the kids gang raping.
[01:42:55.810 --> 01:42:58.810]  Very sad.
[01:42:58.810 --> 01:42:59.810]  It's just a mask.
[01:42:59.810 --> 01:43:01.810]  It's just six feet.
[01:43:01.810 --> 01:43:04.810]  It's just nonessential businesses.
[01:43:04.810 --> 01:43:06.810]  It's just nonessential workers.
[01:43:06.810 --> 01:43:09.810]  It's just until we work it out.
[01:43:09.810 --> 01:43:10.810]  It's just a bar.
[01:43:10.810 --> 01:43:12.810]  It's just a restaurant.
[01:43:12.810 --> 01:43:14.810]  It's just nursing homes.
[01:43:14.810 --> 01:43:16.810]  It's just schools.
[01:43:16.810 --> 01:43:19.810]  It's just to keep from overwhelming medical services.
[01:43:19.810 --> 01:43:22.810]  It's just until the cases go down.
[01:43:22.810 --> 01:43:24.810]  It's just to flatten the curve.
[01:43:24.810 --> 01:43:27.810]  It's just to keep others feeling safe.
[01:43:27.810 --> 01:43:29.810]  It's just for a few more weeks.
[01:43:29.810 --> 01:43:34.810]  It's just gyms, salons, spas and sporting events.
[01:43:34.810 --> 01:43:36.810]  It's just churches and mosques.
[01:43:36.810 --> 01:43:38.810]  It's just singing.
[01:43:38.810 --> 01:43:41.810]  It's just travel.
[01:43:41.810 --> 01:43:43.810]  It's just until we get a vaccine.
[01:43:43.810 --> 01:43:45.810]  It's just for the greater good.
[01:43:45.810 --> 01:43:49.810]  It's just fact checking, not censorship.
[01:43:49.810 --> 01:43:51.810]  It's just mandatory.
[01:43:51.810 --> 01:43:53.810]  It isn't just at all.

[01:45:14.810 --> 01:45:18.810]  What I always need is I always need some sort of boost in the morning.
[01:45:18.810 --> 01:45:22.810]  And so, you know, I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins.
[01:45:22.810 --> 01:45:27.810]  But the one thing that I have really found that makes a difference is brain force.
[01:45:27.810 --> 01:45:31.810]  I'll take brain force in the morning right before I go to my computer
[01:45:31.810 --> 01:45:35.810]  and I'm good for the next four or five hours writing a whole lot of stuff.
[01:45:35.810 --> 01:45:39.810]  So it really is true that brain force is something I use every day
[01:45:39.810 --> 01:45:41.810]  and it helps me with my writing.
[01:45:41.810 --> 01:45:43.810]  All right. We love you. We'll be right back.

[01:45:58.810 --> 01:46:03.810]  Omega-3 fatty acids are needed for optimal strength
[01:46:03.810 --> 01:46:06.810]  and they can only be obtained through diet.
[01:46:06.810 --> 01:46:12.810]  They can be found in grass fed beef, which is why the ruling class is trying to ban it.
[01:46:12.810 --> 01:46:18.810]  And they can be found in fish, which are arguably the best source of omega-3s.
[01:46:18.810 --> 01:46:23.810]  But the problem today is finding fish without a high mercury content.
[01:46:23.810 --> 01:46:30.810]  Your best option is our ultimate fish oil and ultimate krill oil at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:46:30.810 --> 01:46:37.810]  Omega-3 fatty acids are essential for both our neurological and cardiovascular systems,
[01:46:37.810 --> 01:46:39.810]  our brain and our heart.
[01:46:39.810 --> 01:46:44.810]  They improve mood, mental clarity and immune function.
[01:46:44.810 --> 01:46:49.810]  Get your essential omega-3 fatty acids from the best sources available.
[01:46:49.810 --> 01:46:52.810]  Ultimate fish oil and ultimate krill oil.

[01:46:55.810 --> 01:47:05.810]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:07.620 --> 01:47:30.940]  At least three submarines are tasked to take out D.C. and Virginia and launch over 90 weapons
[01:47:30.940 --> 01:47:32.940]  in four minutes after the order.
[01:47:33.340 --> 01:47:38.940]  Within just a few minutes, they will slam into their targets, even though we shoot half of them down.
[01:47:38.940 --> 01:47:45.940]  They're targeting four missiles on every target, depending on itself will be hit by at least 10.
[01:47:52.940 --> 01:47:58.940]  Many of the warheads are programmed that if the missiles disabled, they'll still detonate in the atmosphere,
[01:47:58.940 --> 01:48:04.940]  creating an electromagnetic pulse, and we're run by a bunch of psychotics.
[01:48:04.940 --> 01:48:08.940]  Our old elites were bad, but if they were not like this, they would not do something as dangerous.
[01:48:08.940 --> 01:48:15.940]  Henry Kissinger just told them, stop, but they're not stopping, because they've got so much power
[01:48:15.940 --> 01:48:21.940]  and they've gotten away with so much, they believe they're invincible.
[01:48:28.940 --> 01:48:46.940]  Most theologians agree that America does not exist during the tribulation.
[01:48:46.940 --> 01:48:57.940]  I have had meetings with Bilderberg group members, household names,
[01:48:58.940 --> 01:49:05.940]  almost two years ago, multiple meetings off record.
[01:49:05.940 --> 01:49:11.940]  I can't talk about the specifics, but they agreed that there's a good chance of nuclear war.
[01:49:11.940 --> 01:49:15.940]  And they wanted to ask me where I thought they should go.
[01:49:15.940 --> 01:49:20.940]  I thought that was interesting because they're the ones that have bunkers all over the world.
[01:49:20.940 --> 01:49:33.940]  You ever been in a 50,000 square foot house with 60 foot black marble ceilings?
[01:49:33.940 --> 01:49:37.940]  I have, and I wasn't impressed.
[01:49:37.940 --> 01:49:46.940]  The point is, is that that's what's so frustrating about all this, is this is all real.
[01:49:46.940 --> 01:49:49.940]  Those meetings I told you about are real.
[01:49:49.940 --> 01:49:54.940]  The whistleblower I told you about three weeks ago is real. You see it all happening now.
[01:49:54.940 --> 01:49:59.940]  And I'm telling you that I'm not being dramatic.
[01:49:59.940 --> 01:50:07.940]  There's a very good chance we're going to have a nuclear war.
[01:50:07.940 --> 01:50:12.940]  And I have to be completely honest with you.
[01:50:12.940 --> 01:50:18.940]  My flesh is weak, my spirit strong.
[01:50:18.940 --> 01:50:22.940]  I wake up almost every night at about three, four in the morning.
[01:50:22.940 --> 01:50:28.940]  General Flynn talked about it, how he wakes up with anxiety attacks for the first time ever about all this at about 3 a.m.
[01:50:28.940 --> 01:50:31.940]  I said, last week I interviewed him, I said, yes, sir, I do too.
[01:50:31.940 --> 01:50:33.940]  He said, I woke up at 3 a.m., I didn't go to sleep.
[01:50:33.940 --> 01:50:34.940]  I'm worried about nuclear war and all this.
[01:50:34.940 --> 01:50:36.940]  I said, yes, sir, I woke up last night too, what time?
[01:50:36.940 --> 01:50:38.940]  3.15, me too.
[01:50:38.940 --> 01:50:40.940]  Get up, look at the clock, 3.15.
[01:50:40.940 --> 01:50:46.940]  Didn't go back to sleep.
[01:50:46.940 --> 01:50:49.940]  And I've never, never been like that.
[01:50:49.940 --> 01:50:52.940]  And I have real guilt because I'm not a guilty type person.
[01:50:52.940 --> 01:50:58.940]  I feel pretty good about what I've done in my life and I've not been a coward and I've tried to be as honorable as I can.
[01:50:58.940 --> 01:51:02.940]  But my flesh is strong.
[01:51:02.940 --> 01:51:08.940]  And it's like you need to get your family to South America or to some Pacific island now.
[01:51:08.940 --> 01:51:11.940]  Go, go, get up, get up, get up.
[01:51:11.940 --> 01:51:21.940]  Yesterday I got home at about 6 o'clock, went in, had dinner with my six and a half year old daughter and my wife and I looked at her.
[01:51:21.940 --> 01:51:30.940]  And I said, I had a very intense drive and premonition to get out of the United States and just hang it up.
[01:51:30.940 --> 01:51:33.940]  And I said, I don't want to do that, I want to keep fighting.
[01:51:33.940 --> 01:51:38.940]  But I said, I really felt like it was the Holy Spirit, maybe just the danger level.
[01:51:38.940 --> 01:51:40.940]  I don't think the Holy Spirit was telling me to quit.
[01:51:40.940 --> 01:51:46.940]  She said, well, maybe it was a demon, you need to really pray about this and think about this longer, which is true.
[01:51:46.940 --> 01:51:55.940]  But I feel, I mean, I look at my beautiful six year old daughter, so innocent, so smart, so sweet.
[01:51:55.940 --> 01:52:01.940]  And then I look at my son and my older daughter, my middle daughter, they're so good.
[01:52:01.940 --> 01:52:12.940]  And every fiber of me says, leave, get out of the United States.
[01:52:12.940 --> 01:52:15.940]  But my spirit says, you're going to stay here and see this through.
[01:52:15.940 --> 01:52:22.940]  And then I see the arrogant left and their lawyers and their agents and their people and they have no idea this is going on.
[01:52:22.940 --> 01:52:29.940]  They think it's completely funny.
[01:52:29.940 --> 01:52:37.940]  But when I have these urges, I almost always follow the urges of the spirit, not the urges of the flesh.
[01:52:37.940 --> 01:52:41.940]  But for the first time, I felt it was an urge of the spirit yesterday.
[01:52:41.940 --> 01:52:44.940]  I'm just telling you, I don't know what to do.
[01:52:44.940 --> 01:52:48.940]  Maybe shut the phones up next week and ask, what do you think?
[01:52:48.940 --> 01:52:49.940]  Well, what can we do?
[01:52:49.940 --> 01:52:56.940]  But I've never had it at a spirit level and that really freaked me out.
[01:52:56.940 --> 01:52:58.940]  So I couldn't sleep last night.
[01:52:58.940 --> 01:53:02.940]  I spent about 10, woke up at like midnight, went back to bed, woke up at like three.
[01:53:02.940 --> 01:53:05.940]  I didn't get any sleep last night.
[01:53:05.940 --> 01:53:11.940]  And I got up this morning and I was so upset.
[01:53:11.940 --> 01:53:18.940]  I went in the bathroom and I started vomiting.
[01:53:18.940 --> 01:53:25.940]  And it was my physiology trying to change the situation because your body knows you're being poisoned, you're being attacked.
[01:53:25.940 --> 01:53:27.940]  And it wants to say, I'm under attack.
[01:53:27.940 --> 01:53:28.940]  I'm going to throw up.
[01:53:28.940 --> 01:53:29.940]  Must have been something I hate.
[01:53:29.940 --> 01:53:31.940]  And I'm not like some bulimic folks.
[01:53:31.940 --> 01:53:33.940]  I don't throw up very often.
[01:53:33.940 --> 01:53:34.940]  I don't even trouble to have the flu.
[01:53:34.940 --> 01:53:41.940]  And I puked and puked and puked nothing but bile and hugged the toilet for like 20 minutes.
[01:53:41.940 --> 01:53:44.940]  And my eyes were watering.
[01:53:44.940 --> 01:53:46.940]  And like 5 a.m., my wife woke up.
[01:53:46.940 --> 01:53:51.940]  She heard me and she came in and I'm laying on the bathroom floor with puke on me.
[01:53:51.940 --> 01:53:52.940]  And she says, what's up?
[01:53:52.940 --> 01:53:53.940]  What's happening?
[01:53:53.940 --> 01:53:58.940]  And I said, I told you, this is such a big decision.
[01:53:58.940 --> 01:54:01.940]  Plus the southern hemisphere is not going to be safe.
[01:54:01.940 --> 01:54:03.940]  Even though most of the radiation will stay in the north.
[01:54:03.940 --> 01:54:10.940]  But my cells, and they're never wrong, are mad at me.
[01:54:10.940 --> 01:54:14.940]  And they're telling me, you need to leave with your family now.
[01:54:14.940 --> 01:54:15.940]  Do you hear me?
[01:54:15.940 --> 01:54:19.940]  And I'm like, well, we're going to fix this.
[01:54:19.940 --> 01:54:21.940]  My cells are like, no you're not.
[01:54:21.940 --> 01:54:24.940]  So I don't know what the end game is.
[01:54:24.940 --> 01:54:30.940]  I don't even know why I'm saying this other than it happened.
[01:54:30.940 --> 01:54:36.940]  I just want you to know that I've never felt this much danger.
[01:54:36.940 --> 01:54:41.940]  And look, I'm pretty tough, okay?
[01:54:41.940 --> 01:54:44.940]  Some big guy starts a fight with me, it's the opposite.
[01:54:44.940 --> 01:54:50.940]  I'm going to climb up on his ass, jump on him like a gorilla, and I'm going to fuck him up, man.
[01:54:50.940 --> 01:54:55.940]  I mean, I'm lined up, I'm primal.
[01:54:55.940 --> 01:55:02.940]  I don't have a fear of like a six foot seven giant muscular guy starts a fight with me for no reason.
[01:55:02.940 --> 01:55:05.940]  It's like, I'm not intimidated by that.
[01:55:05.940 --> 01:55:07.940]  In fact, I'm intimidated by a little guy starting to fight with me.
[01:55:07.940 --> 01:55:09.940]  Like, why are they doing that?
[01:55:09.940 --> 01:55:11.940]  I accept the challenge.
[01:55:11.940 --> 01:55:21.940]  But I said on Jack Pacific's show today, I've said I'm a fearless person, and it's really true.
[01:55:21.940 --> 01:55:24.940]  I don't have fear of things I need to do.
[01:55:24.940 --> 01:55:27.940]  But I'm in it for the first time in my life.
[01:55:27.940 --> 01:55:37.940]  I don't know if the emotion is called fear, but Jesus at the Garden of Gethsemane,
[01:55:38.940 --> 01:55:48.940]  hours before he was taken into Roman custody, and a day later crucified, knew what was about to happen to him.
[01:55:48.940 --> 01:55:50.940]  He cried.
[01:55:50.940 --> 01:55:53.940]  He said, may this cup pass from me.
[01:55:53.940 --> 01:55:56.940]  I don't want to do this.
[01:55:56.940 --> 01:56:00.940]  And his father said, you're going to do it.
[01:56:00.940 --> 01:56:03.940]  And I don't compare myself to Christ.
[01:56:03.940 --> 01:56:12.940]  What I'm saying is, that is where I met where I was on international top Russian TV show two nights ago.
[01:56:12.940 --> 01:56:16.940]  And I wanted to go on there and cover big topics, the rest of it.
[01:56:16.940 --> 01:56:21.940]  And I couldn't believe I was on top Russian TV talking about nuclear war, and I started crying.
[01:56:21.940 --> 01:56:25.940]  And I wiped it away.
[01:56:25.940 --> 01:56:27.940]  They didn't notice.
[01:56:27.940 --> 01:56:29.940]  The point was is that that's the times we're in.
[01:56:29.940 --> 01:56:31.940]  That's where we are.
[01:56:31.940 --> 01:56:33.940]  The feds are asking for prison.
[01:56:33.940 --> 01:56:46.940]  And they say in the recommended sentencing document that I'll cover when we come back, because he's not apologetic.
[01:56:46.940 --> 01:56:50.940]  He's not remorseful.
[01:56:50.940 --> 01:56:55.940]  He doesn't believe the election was real.
[01:56:55.940 --> 01:57:00.940]  And he called Joe Biden names.
[01:57:00.940 --> 01:57:04.940]  In America, the feds filed documents.
[01:57:04.940 --> 01:57:09.940]  Saying we want prison time for his speech.
[01:57:09.940 --> 01:57:12.940]  The dishonor of these people.
[01:57:12.940 --> 01:57:17.940]  The birthright, they're murdering.
[01:57:17.940 --> 01:57:23.940]  Why stay here and fight for them?
[01:57:23.940 --> 01:57:26.940]  Let them have their nuclear arm again.
[01:57:26.940 --> 01:57:28.940]  That's one thought. I'm not saying that.
[01:57:29.940 --> 01:57:34.940]  But that's the thing. They'll know when they're in their house and the windows all blow out.
[01:57:34.940 --> 01:57:36.940]  And the electricity goes off.
[01:57:36.940 --> 01:57:39.940]  And three days later their kids are dying of radiation poisoning.
[01:57:39.940 --> 01:57:42.940]  They'll know then, won't they?
[01:57:42.940 --> 01:57:44.940]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:46.600 --> 01:57:50.140]  Bodies is back.

[02:00:05.640 --> 02:00:14.560]  All right, our special guest from Hawaii, an emergency worker with a long credited background
[02:00:14.560 --> 02:00:18.160]  who's there, lives there, is going to be joining us coming up because they want us to move
[02:00:18.160 --> 02:00:19.600]  on to the next story and forget about it.
[02:00:19.600 --> 02:00:22.440]  No, we're not going to.
[02:00:22.440 --> 02:00:24.640]  But let me get into Owen Schroyer.
[02:00:24.640 --> 02:00:27.600]  So you read this Gateway Pundit article and you think, is it really that bad?
[02:00:27.600 --> 02:00:28.600]  No, it's...
[02:00:28.600 --> 02:00:29.600]  I love the Gateway Pundit.
[02:00:29.600 --> 02:00:30.600]  They're great people.
[02:00:30.600 --> 02:00:31.600]  It's way worse than they're saying, okay?
[02:00:31.600 --> 02:00:32.960]  So no, the story's not accurate.
[02:00:32.960 --> 02:00:33.960]  It's way worse.
[02:00:33.960 --> 02:00:38.200]  Infowars host Owen Schroyer pleads guilty to roll in January 6th riot, because they're
[02:00:38.200 --> 02:00:42.720]  going to put him through the whole DC trial, the rest of it, statements of offensive
[02:00:42.720 --> 02:00:49.200]  details, complete absence of criminal conduct.
[02:00:49.200 --> 02:00:54.680]  And they go on to say, because of his political speech, they're calling for jail
[02:00:54.680 --> 02:00:55.680]  time.
[02:00:55.680 --> 02:00:59.960]  DOJ prosecutors seek 120 days in prison at least for Owen Schroyer for speaking out
[02:00:59.960 --> 02:01:04.520]  against stolen 2020 election, a speech crime.
[02:01:04.520 --> 02:01:09.640]  But let's not just believe the Gateway Pundit, and I appreciate him covering it.
[02:01:09.640 --> 02:01:10.640]  It's much worse.
[02:01:10.640 --> 02:01:17.760]  Here is the sentencing recommendation two days ago filed, and they say the Democrats
[02:01:17.760 --> 02:01:23.080]  are communists, Schroyer did not step foot inside the Capitol.
[02:01:23.080 --> 02:01:24.280]  He didn't need to.
[02:01:24.280 --> 02:01:32.120]  Schroyer helped create January 6th, showing you the document, and it goes on
[02:01:32.120 --> 02:01:42.440]  here in the charging document to say, he continued, and they give the video
[02:01:42.440 --> 02:01:49.280]  mark from the show, he continued, we will not accept the fake election or the
[02:01:49.280 --> 02:01:53.520]  child molester, Joe Biden, the Chinese communist agent, Joe Biden, all that's
[02:01:53.560 --> 02:01:58.380]  true, by the way, we know where he belongs, and it's not in the White
[02:01:58.380 --> 02:01:59.380]  House.
[02:01:59.380 --> 02:02:06.840]  Then they go, he's not repentant, he then again on the show in August
[02:02:06.840 --> 02:02:17.800]  said this, so again, they're in the document saying that he is not
[02:02:17.800 --> 02:02:22.160]  repentant.
[02:02:22.160 --> 02:02:26.520]  They go on to say he does not reverse his narrative on January 6th, but he
[02:02:26.520 --> 02:02:33.000]  says it was staged by the feds.
[02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:40.480]  He goes on, notably for the misdemeanor defendant like Schroyer, the absence of
[02:02:40.480 --> 02:02:43.280]  violence and destructive acts is not a mitigating factor.
[02:02:43.280 --> 02:02:45.920]  Had Schroyer engaged in such conduct, he would have faced additional
[02:02:45.920 --> 02:02:46.920]  criminal charges.
[02:02:46.920 --> 02:02:50.880]  Schroyer cannot light a fire near a can of gasoline and then express
[02:02:50.880 --> 02:02:53.420]  concern or disbelief when it explodes.
[02:02:53.420 --> 02:02:59.920]  So you go to a protest and something bad happens, it's your fault.
[02:02:59.920 --> 02:03:05.840]  They go on to say we want to impose a larger sentence because again, he is not
[02:03:05.840 --> 02:03:11.880]  repentant for what he has said or what he has done.
[02:03:11.880 --> 02:03:17.800]  And he said on August 27th that he still believes that the election was
[02:03:17.800 --> 02:03:23.920]  stolen.
[02:03:23.920 --> 02:03:27.680]  That's America, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:03:27.680 --> 02:03:33.280]  That's our country and that's him facing sentencing next week.
[02:03:33.280 --> 02:03:38.200]  Owen Schroyer is not repentant, he's still saying they stole the
[02:03:38.200 --> 02:03:43.320]  election and he said again on August 27th, Biden's a pedophile.
[02:03:43.320 --> 02:03:46.920]  Well, if he's wrong, that's his free speech or suing.
[02:03:46.920 --> 02:03:47.920]  No.
[02:03:47.920 --> 02:03:48.920]  They don't care.
[02:03:48.920 --> 02:03:51.960]  All right, we have a special guest coming up and I noticed that he's got
[02:03:51.960 --> 02:03:55.040]  another fellow with him so we'll find out who that is and we really
[02:03:55.040 --> 02:04:00.160]  appreciate him joining us and we'll be breaking it all down when we return
[02:04:00.160 --> 02:04:05.160]  next segment in just two minutes from now.
[02:04:05.160 --> 02:04:13.720]  We will also watch Owen today at 3 p.m. central with the war room but it
[02:04:13.720 --> 02:04:20.000]  really hit me this morning that Owen, no criminal record, a great guy
[02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:24.520]  is facing jail and may not even be here next week if they decide to
[02:04:24.520 --> 02:04:28.880]  throw him in prison.
[02:04:28.880 --> 02:04:33.720]  And the feds have been like, well, don't complain too much, it may be longer.
[02:04:33.720 --> 02:04:38.720]  They could do a year but again, that's where we are, ladies and
[02:04:38.720 --> 02:04:42.280]  gentlemen, and that's how this works but you can fight back against
[02:04:42.280 --> 02:04:43.280]  this tyranny.
[02:04:43.280 --> 02:04:45.000]  You can share the word about the broadcast, you can share
[02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.880]  the clip and audio and you can pray for Owen and you can buy
[02:04:47.880 --> 02:04:51.560]  products at M4S4.com, DNA of Force Plus, finally back in stock,
[02:04:51.560 --> 02:04:52.560]  discounted.

[02:04:53.560 --> 02:04:54.560]  Great products you need.
[02:04:54.560 --> 02:04:55.560]  Take action now.
[02:04:55.560 --> 02:05:00.120]  I didn't realize this was back this week.
[02:05:00.120 --> 02:05:01.120]  I thought it was next week.
[02:05:01.120 --> 02:05:02.120]  I come in this morning.
[02:05:02.120 --> 02:05:05.600]  It's back in the warehouse ready to roll.
[02:05:05.600 --> 02:05:09.160]  Body's ultimate memory formula and the first thing I did was pop one of
[02:05:09.160 --> 02:05:11.560]  these bad boys.
[02:05:11.560 --> 02:05:13.480]  Overhead shot, please.
[02:05:13.480 --> 02:05:17.720]  Look how full this model is.
[02:05:17.720 --> 02:05:20.760]  Right to the top, folks.
[02:05:20.760 --> 02:05:26.560]  Right to the top with these 95% humanoids.
[02:05:26.560 --> 02:05:30.600]  Again most turmeric formulas are 5%, some are maybe 10.
[02:05:30.600 --> 02:05:33.360]  The other strongest brands are 75%.
[02:05:33.360 --> 02:05:37.440]  This is 95%.
[02:05:37.440 --> 02:05:38.440]  Super constant.
[02:05:38.440 --> 02:05:39.440]  It's like taking one pill.
[02:05:39.440 --> 02:05:42.040]  Taking 10 of the average pill.
[02:05:42.040 --> 02:05:43.040]  It's that powerful.
[02:05:43.040 --> 02:05:44.040]  Or more.
[02:05:44.040 --> 02:05:48.400]  So they're available at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:05:48.400 --> 02:05:53.200]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula, pulled out for almost eight months, back in stock
[02:05:53.200 --> 02:06:08.320]  at Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:06:08.320 --> 02:06:19.360]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:19.360 --> 02:06:31.160]  It's Friday, September 8th, 2023 and we're not talking about conspiracy theories here
[02:06:31.160 --> 02:06:32.160]  today.
[02:06:32.160 --> 02:06:35.320]  We're not talking about theoretical things.
[02:06:35.320 --> 02:06:43.120]  We're not talking about things that are fiction or postulating possible futures.
[02:06:43.120 --> 02:06:50.000]  We're talking about what is known to be deployed that is being rolled out right now
[02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:51.000]  against humanity.
[02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:56.120]  And one of my greatest frustrations, I've been on there 29 years, is I had to read
[02:06:56.120 --> 02:07:01.320]  Pentagon documents that were public 25, 26 years ago about spider goats that are part
[02:07:01.320 --> 02:07:07.240]  of the creek, body armor through their milk to the Pentagon for a giant project and China
[02:07:07.240 --> 02:07:09.120]  has it as well.
[02:07:09.120 --> 02:07:13.280]  And callers would call in and say, there's no way we have goats spliced with spiders
[02:07:13.280 --> 02:07:16.200]  that's just made up.
[02:07:16.200 --> 02:07:19.840]  This week they came out and said, yeah, we've created humanoids in the laboratory
[02:07:19.840 --> 02:07:26.280]  that don't have any sperm or eggs involved or any parents, but we're not going to upset
[02:07:26.280 --> 02:07:27.280]  you.
[02:07:27.280 --> 02:07:28.280]  It's discreet.
[02:07:28.280 --> 02:07:29.280]  We're not going to show them to you.
[02:07:30.240 --> 02:07:34.120]  So see, we don't have little green men from Mars landing, little green men.
[02:07:34.120 --> 02:07:39.320]  We don't have foreign aliens proven here, but we have alien life forms being created
[02:07:39.320 --> 02:07:40.320]  on earth.
[02:07:40.320 --> 02:07:49.320]  So here we are on a special Friday transmission, the Alex Jones Show 2.0, exclusively at
[02:07:49.320 --> 02:07:50.800]  Steven Crowder and the Mug Club.
[02:07:55.880 --> 02:08:09.880]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say I don't know what's going
[02:08:09.880 --> 02:08:13.880]  to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe you've got one!
[02:08:13.880 --> 02:08:20.880]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:20.880 --> 02:08:24.880]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:51.880 --> 02:08:55.880]  Alright, for the balance of the hour, we're going to skip some of the breaks so we have more time.
[02:08:55.880 --> 02:09:02.880]  Steve Sleptovic is our guest, and his bio would take an hour to go over, but he is an emergency manager
[02:09:02.880 --> 02:09:08.880]  and has been involved in a lot of different emergencies around the world.
[02:09:08.880 --> 02:09:12.880]  He also has a firefighter friend of his that's been involved, they live in Hawaii.
[02:09:12.880 --> 02:09:21.880]  SteveSleptovic.com, S-L-E-P-C-E-V-I-C.com, and he has his associate with him, Sam Eaton.
[02:09:21.880 --> 02:09:28.880]  So I think it's best we start off here with you guys introducing yourselves, and then I wanted to get you on
[02:09:28.880 --> 02:09:33.880]  because I saw your reports and things a few weeks ago, but you were too busy with the helicopters
[02:09:33.880 --> 02:09:38.880]  and the aid and getting around the exclusion zone there in Lahaina, Maui, and the rest of it,
[02:09:38.880 --> 02:09:41.880]  but that story's already moved off, we moved on to other things.
[02:09:41.880 --> 02:09:45.880]  I don't want to move off from that because it's really illustrated with the tyranny,
[02:09:45.880 --> 02:09:49.880]  plus those are fellow Americans and Hawaiians that don't deserve what's happened to them.
[02:09:49.880 --> 02:09:56.880]  So introduce yourself, tell us who you are, and then you'll have the floor here to give us your prognosis
[02:09:56.880 --> 02:10:02.880]  and your analysis of what's really happened with the blocking the people in and turning the water off
[02:10:02.880 --> 02:10:07.880]  and not triggering the emergency alarms and the high winds and leaving the power on.
[02:10:07.880 --> 02:10:15.880]  And then now the mayor and the emergency manager are saying don't look at social media, don't research it,
[02:10:15.880 --> 02:10:20.880]  shut up, and they're trying to keep the media out, even people miles away, they come up and harass them.
[02:10:20.880 --> 02:10:28.880]  Thank you so much for joining us, and so why don't you, Steve, introduce this,
[02:10:28.880 --> 02:10:33.880]  tell us who you are and tell us who your firefighter associate is, and then break down what happened.
[02:10:34.880 --> 02:10:40.880]  Okay, so been at this business since 1989, the first storm I ever worked, first disaster I ever deployed to
[02:10:40.880 --> 02:10:46.880]  was Hurricane Andrew that was many, many years ago, then after that it was the earthquake in 94 Northridge,
[02:10:46.880 --> 02:10:51.880]  it was a civil unrest, what you want to call the Rodney King riots in Los Angeles.
[02:10:51.880 --> 02:10:56.880]  So wherever a wide area disaster's happening, be it natural or unnatural,
[02:10:56.880 --> 02:10:59.880]  we're typically right there what we call on day one.
[02:10:59.880 --> 02:11:02.880]  In some cases, like the many hurricane deployments we have,
[02:11:02.880 --> 02:11:07.880]  we're there three, four days ahead of time working for the critical infrastructure facilities
[02:11:07.880 --> 02:11:12.880]  like the hospitals, the airports, the shipping ports, all that type of stuff,
[02:11:12.880 --> 02:11:17.880]  really bringing in the fuel, the power, additional paramedics, additional security teams,
[02:11:17.880 --> 02:11:20.880]  because everyone's leaving the area.
[02:11:20.880 --> 02:11:24.880]  Yeah, so I mean this has been our life's work.
[02:11:24.880 --> 02:11:30.880]  My associate here is Sam Eaton, he's a former battalion chief, 30 plus years in the fire service.
[02:11:30.880 --> 02:11:33.880]  Sam, I'll let you share a little bit about your background.
[02:11:33.880 --> 02:11:39.880]  I'm 30 years with the South Florida Fire Department here now with the SRP the last three years.
[02:11:39.880 --> 02:11:45.880]  This is my background is I've obviously worked as a battalion chief for 12 years
[02:11:45.880 --> 02:11:51.880]  in the last part of my career, and I was involved in the emergency operations center,
[02:11:51.880 --> 02:12:00.880]  battalion command for disasters, and actually just as Steve, my first storm was actually Hurricane Andrew.
[02:12:00.880 --> 02:12:03.880]  So it goes all the way back to that point.
[02:12:03.880 --> 02:12:10.880]  To be with this organization, this company, to deploy and still be in service in retirement here is an honor.
[02:12:10.880 --> 02:12:11.880]  That's incredibly important.
[02:12:11.880 --> 02:12:16.880]  Describe what your company does, because I saw you on the show, the amazing things you do,
[02:12:16.880 --> 02:12:19.880]  and you've been all over this, so tell people about what your company does,
[02:12:19.880 --> 02:12:24.880]  and let's get into what you've done in Maui and give us your expert analysis on what's happening.
[02:12:24.880 --> 02:12:30.880]  Yeah, so we do, because we do planning, the planning that we do is a very high level, right?
[02:12:30.880 --> 02:12:35.880]  In this business, I'm a solutions guy, so with a little bit of an engineering background was where I started,
[02:12:35.880 --> 02:12:40.880]  every time I'd see these plans fail, my job was to go in there and find a better solution.
[02:12:40.880 --> 02:12:46.880]  So in the process of creating these plans, I put a, embedded a highly trained critical response team
[02:12:46.880 --> 02:12:48.880]  to be a part of that plan.
[02:12:48.880 --> 02:12:54.880]  So typically when we get into these wide area disasters, the first thing that we do is we show up at the EOC,
[02:12:54.880 --> 02:12:59.880]  the Emergency Operations Center, we announce ourselves, we say here's our capabilities,
[02:12:59.880 --> 02:13:04.880]  we have the abilities to bring in X amount of security teams, power up the entire municipality,
[02:13:04.880 --> 02:13:09.880]  the hospital, the ports, whatever is needed, we can help with clean up, the remediation.
[02:13:09.880 --> 02:13:13.880]  So it's very similar to a military operation?
[02:13:13.880 --> 02:13:14.880]  Very much so, yeah.
[02:13:14.880 --> 02:13:20.880]  And we're a private contractor, so we move much faster without any government red tape, right?
[02:13:20.880 --> 02:13:27.880]  And so it's real simple, and in all my experience of doing this 33 plus years, we're welcomed in, right?
[02:13:27.880 --> 02:13:30.880]  We show up, they're like, oh, you have this? Okay, can you do that? Can you handle this?
[02:13:30.880 --> 02:13:35.880]  You know, everything from satellite phones to setting up comms to setting up everything that needs to be done,
[02:13:35.880 --> 02:13:37.880]  sanitation, base camps.
[02:13:37.880 --> 02:13:39.880]  And again, I've been reading your site, and I'm going to give you the floor,
[02:13:39.880 --> 02:13:41.880]  but that's what I'm getting from you and what the locals say,
[02:13:41.880 --> 02:13:47.880]  and their default not following standard procedure to even render aid or take help.
[02:13:47.880 --> 02:13:49.880]  I mean, so what you're saying is, I know you're about to go there,
[02:13:49.880 --> 02:13:52.880]  is that you've never seen it before where you're blocked.
[02:13:52.880 --> 02:13:55.880]  Yeah, I mean, it was a straight arm approach.
[02:13:55.880 --> 02:13:56.880]  They're like, we have this handled.
[02:13:56.880 --> 02:14:01.880]  I'm like, well, looking around you, based on results, you don't, you know?
[02:14:01.880 --> 02:14:07.880]  We obviously responded to multiple incidents across the country in different deployments and stuff.
[02:14:07.880 --> 02:14:14.880]  When we came into Maui, it was like a ghost town from a standpoint of support.
[02:14:14.880 --> 02:14:21.880]  You're seeing locals having to dig down and do things that normally the government would be there actually providing.
[02:14:21.880 --> 02:14:25.880]  They were bringing in food and supplies from the water side because they couldn't get in through the roadways
[02:14:25.880 --> 02:14:27.880]  because they were blocked off by the government.
[02:14:27.880 --> 02:14:32.880]  So my heart goes out to the Maui people as they lost all of this,
[02:14:32.880 --> 02:14:36.880]  and in the midst of all that, they did not get the support, at least for the first couple of weeks,
[02:14:36.880 --> 02:14:37.880]  that they needed.
[02:14:37.880 --> 02:14:40.880]  Well, let's go back and start there because I interrupted,
[02:14:40.880 --> 02:14:45.880]  because I'm not an emergency manager like you, but I follow disasters.
[02:14:45.880 --> 02:14:46.880]  I cover it.
[02:14:46.880 --> 02:14:49.880]  Normally, all the help-credited groups, they bring you in.
[02:14:49.880 --> 02:14:50.880]  That is so critical.
[02:14:50.880 --> 02:14:51.880]  That's what the locals all said.
[02:14:51.880 --> 02:14:55.880]  Day one, people even from their own town couldn't bring in groceries,
[02:14:55.880 --> 02:14:58.880]  so there was a day one cover-up what's happening.
[02:14:58.880 --> 02:15:00.880]  I mean, you could see the cover-up.
[02:15:00.880 --> 02:15:04.880]  Yeah, the cover-up was going in the government sector of it,
[02:15:04.880 --> 02:15:08.880]  but what was interesting was they set no perimeter on it.
[02:15:08.880 --> 02:15:13.880]  So one of the people that I know is a chef in town, he didn't even know about the fire.
[02:15:13.880 --> 02:15:15.880]  He was driving from out of town where he lives.
[02:15:15.880 --> 02:15:17.880]  As he drove into town, there was no security.
[02:15:17.880 --> 02:15:19.880]  There was no perimeter.
[02:15:19.880 --> 02:15:23.880]  He's driving by burnt vehicles with bodies slumped over the steering wheel,
[02:15:23.880 --> 02:15:25.880]  like a vehicle of four people burnt.
[02:15:25.880 --> 02:15:27.880]  I mean, talk about Twilight Zone.
[02:15:27.880 --> 02:15:33.880]  So they had a lockdown during the fire, but not at first right after.
[02:15:33.880 --> 02:15:36.880]  And there was another one of our friends who was a security guard
[02:15:36.880 --> 02:15:39.880]  who was trying to go by the traffic where they had blocked,
[02:15:39.880 --> 02:15:43.880]  the cops had blocked off for one area where they said the power lines were down.
[02:15:43.880 --> 02:15:47.880]  But it was interesting because people were coming off the hill
[02:15:47.880 --> 02:15:53.880]  and then they were pushing everybody from both other exits into the center, causing a massive pile-up.
[02:15:53.880 --> 02:15:56.880]  And the cop that was standing in the blocking the road
[02:15:56.880 --> 02:15:59.880]  was blocking it on the other side of the power line,
[02:15:59.880 --> 02:16:01.880]  saying that he's there to protect it from the power line,
[02:16:01.880 --> 02:16:03.880]  yet the power's out.
[02:16:03.880 --> 02:16:09.880]  So the thing about, well, the people, the local people don't like to get on camera
[02:16:09.880 --> 02:16:16.880]  because in a small community, the cop has a kid which your kid goes to school with, right?
[02:16:16.880 --> 02:16:21.880]  And in that area, these generational families, they keep really to themselves.
[02:16:21.880 --> 02:16:23.880]  Well, I talked to them privately.
[02:16:23.880 --> 02:16:26.880]  They say it's a setup, but they're scared.
[02:16:26.880 --> 02:16:27.880]  Yeah.
[02:16:27.880 --> 02:16:31.880]  I mean, we sat down last night, and it's a very private community.
[02:16:31.880 --> 02:16:33.880]  We work very closely with the Native Hawaiians,
[02:16:33.880 --> 02:16:37.880]  and we've done that because I've been coming to this island since I've been 19 years old.
[02:16:37.880 --> 02:16:42.880]  The first set of plans I did when I was 19 going to school for architecture and engineering
[02:16:42.880 --> 02:16:45.880]  was in Kona for a two-car garage in Lanai.
[02:16:45.880 --> 02:16:50.880]  And I've been surfing out here, got to know the big wave community very well since I was 19.
[02:16:50.880 --> 02:16:53.880]  So you know the community, you're in love with it, and now you see it being raped.
[02:16:53.880 --> 02:16:58.880]  Yeah. So there's a lot of concerns,
[02:16:58.880 --> 02:17:02.880]  and there are a group of Native Hawaiians that are really taking to this
[02:17:02.880 --> 02:17:06.880]  because from day one when we got out here, I had a private meeting with them.
[02:17:06.880 --> 02:17:08.880]  We all sat down as a collective.
[02:17:08.880 --> 02:17:11.880]  Sam was there. Jeffrey was there. A whole group of us got together.
[02:17:11.880 --> 02:17:17.880]  And what I explained to them, I said, you guys got to lock arms like you never have done before.
[02:17:17.880 --> 02:17:21.880]  The only way to keep this group from moving in
[02:17:21.880 --> 02:17:24.880]  and them simply you giving up your property
[02:17:24.880 --> 02:17:28.880]  because what people don't understand is the insurance company is going to slow pay, right?
[02:17:28.880 --> 02:17:31.880]  Your loss of use is going to run out in one year.
[02:17:31.880 --> 02:17:35.880]  All the houses that are being rebuilt are going to have to be rebuilt with the new fire codes.
[02:17:35.880 --> 02:17:38.880]  There's going to be new easements, which these houses were plantation homes
[02:17:38.880 --> 02:17:41.880]  where people used to walk from their homes to the sugarcane fields, right?
[02:17:41.880 --> 02:17:43.880]  If FEMA implements their flood zones,
[02:17:43.880 --> 02:17:46.880]  you're going to have to raise a lot of the properties along the coast off the highway.
[02:17:46.880 --> 02:17:48.880]  Exactly. It's meant to drive the poor people out.
[02:17:48.880 --> 02:17:50.880]  So let's pull back 35,000 with you and let's start over.
[02:17:50.880 --> 02:17:53.880]  Amazing interview. I know you're busy, but your time.
[02:17:53.880 --> 02:17:56.880]  How long have you been there? What are you witnessing?
[02:17:56.880 --> 02:17:58.880]  Let's look at the disaster first.
[02:17:58.880 --> 02:18:03.880]  And as an emergency manager, what do you see happening that's so different from other events?
[02:18:03.880 --> 02:18:06.880]  Let's talk about the disaster.
[02:18:06.880 --> 02:18:08.880]  We're not allowed to go to all the areas.
[02:18:08.880 --> 02:18:12.880]  Obviously, there's a lot of access issues, and those access issues are for good reason.
[02:18:12.880 --> 02:18:15.880]  This is a toxic mess. This is not a wildland fire.
[02:18:15.880 --> 02:18:17.880]  This is a commercial. It's a gigantic commercial structure fire.
[02:18:17.880 --> 02:18:21.880]  It's houses. It's cars. It's residential structures.
[02:18:21.880 --> 02:18:26.880]  And it was wind fueled by that hurricane that was passing past the island,
[02:18:26.880 --> 02:18:32.880]  generating 70, 80 mile an hour winds, sustained winds, during the worst time it could happen.
[02:18:32.880 --> 02:18:34.880]  Once those first couple of structures, we were talking last night,
[02:18:34.880 --> 02:18:37.880]  a bunch of firefighters from the federal side as well as here in Maui.
[02:18:37.880 --> 02:18:42.880]  And once those fires started on the top leading edge of this fire,
[02:18:42.880 --> 02:18:45.880]  there's not a fire department on this earth that could have put that fire out.
[02:18:45.880 --> 02:18:48.880]  There's obviously the water supply issues, and I've heard about that.
[02:18:48.880 --> 02:18:50.880]  Obviously, there's some kind of a system here where they've got to...
[02:18:50.880 --> 02:18:53.880]  Oh, they admit they denied the water that day.
[02:18:53.880 --> 02:18:57.880]  They have to ask permission to get to utilize the water, which boggles my mind.
[02:18:57.880 --> 02:19:00.880]  Let's be clear. Fire happening, and it's denied.
[02:19:00.880 --> 02:19:05.880]  Wherever else there's fire hydrants, the fire department's in control of water and emergencies.
[02:19:05.880 --> 02:19:07.880]  That's the way it should be, and I don't know what happened,
[02:19:07.880 --> 02:19:11.880]  but I'll tell you what, there's a lot of missteps here before, during, and after this fire.
[02:19:11.880 --> 02:19:13.880]  And clearly, this was a tinderbox.
[02:19:13.880 --> 02:19:16.880]  You've got drought-like conditions for the last several years.
[02:19:16.880 --> 02:19:19.880]  I was here 10 years ago. This was a lush area.
[02:19:19.880 --> 02:19:24.880]  I remember, and I came in, and it's just brown.
[02:19:24.880 --> 02:19:28.880]  It's dried out because the water's being taken by, as I understand it,
[02:19:28.880 --> 02:19:32.880]  by corporations and stuff to help their industries
[02:19:32.880 --> 02:19:35.880]  and keep the water in the areas like for cattle and for pineapple
[02:19:35.880 --> 02:19:38.880]  and whatever it happens to be, and these areas are really dry right now.
[02:19:38.880 --> 02:19:43.880]  Throw that on top of a weak infrastructure as far as electrical system is concerned.
[02:19:43.880 --> 02:19:46.880]  You've got winds blowing power lines down. You've got no access to water.
[02:19:46.880 --> 02:19:50.880]  You have limited access already. It's set up for a conflagration.
[02:19:50.880 --> 02:19:55.880]  The emergency operations crews can't get in there, so once this fire started,
[02:19:55.880 --> 02:19:58.880]  it's virtually impossible to make a stand on them
[02:19:58.880 --> 02:20:01.880]  because the wind, it was like a blowtorch blowing through Lahaina.
[02:20:01.880 --> 02:20:03.880]  It was a horrible disaster.
[02:20:03.880 --> 02:20:05.880]  Here's something else to think about.
[02:20:05.880 --> 02:20:08.880]  The last number I heard was 1,100. Missing.
[02:20:08.880 --> 02:20:12.880]  That's not counting undocumented. That's not counting homeless.
[02:20:12.880 --> 02:20:16.880]  And just on the front page of Honolulu's newspaper today,
[02:20:16.880 --> 02:20:18.880]  they're still missing 500 children, and they don't know.
[02:20:18.880 --> 02:20:23.880]  So people were wiped off the face of the earth,
[02:20:23.880 --> 02:20:26.880]  and there's not a damn peep of word out of the media.
[02:20:26.880 --> 02:20:33.880]  Nobody understands this, but this is on a level of 9-11 life of loss.
[02:20:33.880 --> 02:20:39.880]  You're talking about probably close to 2,000 people dead, gone, and perished,
[02:20:39.880 --> 02:20:41.880]  and there's nobody talking about it.
[02:20:41.880 --> 02:20:44.880]  Thank you for keeping it relevant, Alex.
[02:20:44.880 --> 02:20:48.880]  Wow. So you've been all over the country.
[02:20:48.880 --> 02:20:50.880]  You've seen this everywhere. You've been doing it for decades together,
[02:20:50.880 --> 02:20:52.880]  I guess collectively 60 years to two of you,
[02:20:52.880 --> 02:20:55.880]  and what you're saying is what we see in the hearings,
[02:20:55.880 --> 02:20:59.880]  what we see in the city council meetings, the blocking off the roads,
[02:20:59.880 --> 02:21:03.880]  the black rock that owned the power company not trimming the trees,
[02:21:03.880 --> 02:21:08.880]  all of that, I know it's speculation, but just pulling back,
[02:21:08.880 --> 02:21:15.880]  what do the locals think happened, and what do you think really went down?
[02:21:15.880 --> 02:21:20.880]  So if you wanted a perfect storm scenario,
[02:21:20.880 --> 02:21:24.880]  that you wanted to rebuild the city to bring it into a new green,
[02:21:24.880 --> 02:21:30.880]  modern 15-minute-type scenario, this is how you do it.
[02:21:30.880 --> 02:21:32.880]  You just burn it down.
[02:21:32.880 --> 02:21:34.880]  When you have the Chinook winds blowing off that thing,
[02:21:34.880 --> 02:21:39.880]  they can't find, there's so much misinformation as to how the fire started.
[02:21:39.880 --> 02:21:42.880]  At the end of the day, anybody could have gone up there,
[02:21:42.880 --> 02:21:48.880]  lit a match, or started the fire, and that pattern was going to take Lahaina out.
[02:21:48.880 --> 02:21:52.880]  When you push 60-some firefighters into Kula, which is what they did,
[02:21:52.880 --> 02:21:58.880]  they had, I think, 13 engines, there wasn't a firefighter down on Front Street.
[02:21:58.880 --> 02:22:01.880]  So if you're going to remodel and rebuild the city,
[02:22:01.880 --> 02:22:07.880]  you cannot do it with all the historic things that are grandfathered in.
[02:22:07.880 --> 02:22:09.880]  The only way to do it is to level the city.
[02:22:09.880 --> 02:22:13.880]  Now you have a clean pallet that the government's going to pay to demo,
[02:22:13.880 --> 02:22:17.880]  clear all the stuff out, and basically rezone the area.
[02:22:17.880 --> 02:22:19.880]  People are just going to lose their land.
[02:22:19.880 --> 02:22:25.880]  So if you want to take the most prime real estate, this is how you do it.
[02:22:25.880 --> 02:22:28.880]  Well, that's what locals say is it was a choreographed destruction
[02:22:28.880 --> 02:22:32.880]  because you look at every step to mess up, I get there's incompetence,
[02:22:32.880 --> 02:22:36.880]  but to mess up so many times so perfectly is,
[02:22:36.880 --> 02:22:41.880]  and then to cover it up, and then to not render aid,
[02:22:41.880 --> 02:22:44.880]  because I guess if this whole family's dead, they won't be able to stand up,
[02:22:44.880 --> 02:22:46.880]  their property will be taken.
[02:22:47.880 --> 02:22:50.880]  It's hard to put your finger on either side of that coin,
[02:22:50.880 --> 02:22:53.880]  and honestly you can't discount either side of it.
[02:22:53.880 --> 02:22:59.880]  It looks like to me there's enough there that shows a horrific orchestrated,
[02:22:59.880 --> 02:23:03.880]  not orchestrated, non-orchestrated missteps over and over again
[02:23:03.880 --> 02:23:08.880]  that led to this disaster, but there's still questions in my mind
[02:23:08.880 --> 02:23:11.880]  about some of the things that actually went down,
[02:23:11.880 --> 02:23:13.880]  and it's hard to put your finger on it.
[02:23:13.880 --> 02:23:16.880]  Either way, they're covering it up, so we don't know.
[02:23:19.880 --> 02:23:22.880]  Make your point, because I got a thousand questions, but you're there.
[02:23:22.880 --> 02:23:25.880]  What are the key points people need to know?
[02:23:25.880 --> 02:23:29.880]  I think one of the things we're expressing as a company is safety.
[02:23:29.880 --> 02:23:33.880]  This is a, and Steve will tell you this, we've worked since we got here.
[02:23:33.880 --> 02:23:38.880]  My background, I'm actually a director for a cancer prevention team in Florida,
[02:23:38.880 --> 02:23:42.880]  and as soon as I got here, this is a post-fire scenario.
[02:23:42.880 --> 02:23:47.880]  The particulate that's in the area, just in the air alone,
[02:23:47.880 --> 02:23:50.880]  anytime trucks are driving by, this stuff is being rolled up,
[02:23:50.880 --> 02:23:54.880]  and we're talking about arsenic, we're talking about heavy metals, asbestos.
[02:23:54.880 --> 02:24:00.880]  We're talking about petroleum products, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, benzenes.
[02:24:00.880 --> 02:24:02.880]  You can name the list.
[02:24:02.880 --> 02:24:06.880]  Look at any typical structure fire in just a regular home fire,
[02:24:06.880 --> 02:24:07.880]  and you're going to find those things.
[02:24:07.880 --> 02:24:09.880]  Now you're talking on a mass scale.
[02:24:09.880 --> 02:24:12.880]  So there's an area right now that people shouldn't be going into.
[02:24:12.880 --> 02:24:15.880]  So when the government says, we don't want you down there,
[02:24:15.880 --> 02:24:18.880]  there is a heavy health risk.
[02:24:18.880 --> 02:24:24.880]  If you look at the number of people that have been injured and affected by 9-11 since-
[02:24:24.880 --> 02:24:27.880]  Yeah, so this is East Palestine, basically.
[02:24:27.880 --> 02:24:32.880]  Yeah, this is one of those things right now that you're talking about years
[02:24:32.880 --> 02:24:35.880]  that this is going to impact the environment, not just ecologically,
[02:24:35.880 --> 02:24:38.880]  but the health concerns for the public.
[02:24:38.880 --> 02:24:41.880]  So we initially put out a safety briefing right off the bat.
[02:24:41.880 --> 02:24:44.880]  You need to protect yourself, make sure you're on respiratory protection,
[02:24:44.880 --> 02:24:46.880]  that you're covered completely, that when you go down there,
[02:24:46.880 --> 02:24:49.880]  don't bring your kids down there if you're allowed to go to your property.
[02:24:49.880 --> 02:24:50.880]  This is not a place to play around.
[02:24:50.880 --> 02:24:54.880]  If you get in there, make sure you get what you need and then get out.
[02:24:54.880 --> 02:24:58.880]  Make sure you clean yourself up and disrobe or just get rid of your clothing
[02:24:58.880 --> 02:25:00.880]  because this stuff is just highly toxic.
[02:25:00.880 --> 02:25:03.880]  So that's one of the things that we've been working on with the public
[02:25:03.880 --> 02:25:06.880]  and obviously helping them understand that
[02:25:06.880 --> 02:25:08.880]  because firefighters have an understanding of it.
[02:25:08.880 --> 02:25:12.880]  We certainly do as emergency management, but the general population,
[02:25:12.880 --> 02:25:16.880]  the workers, the volunteers, the people that are coming in for us contractors,
[02:25:16.880 --> 02:25:18.880]  they just have no clue. Nobody's wearing anything down here.
[02:25:18.880 --> 02:25:21.880]  Well, let's be clear. Hold on, Steve. I'm going to go to you, but-
[02:25:21.880 --> 02:25:22.880]  Yeah.
[02:25:22.880 --> 02:25:25.880]  You've been to a bunch of emergencies, probably hundreds.
[02:25:25.880 --> 02:25:28.880]  You've never seen, you said earlier, the cover-up here.
[02:25:28.880 --> 02:25:32.880]  So what is the current state of the cover-up that gets to your point?
[02:25:33.880 --> 02:25:40.880]  You know, to me, when you see the President Biden walking down the center of Front Street
[02:25:40.880 --> 02:25:44.880]  with no personal protective equipment on, no respirators, no nothing,
[02:25:44.880 --> 02:25:47.880]  just walking down the middle with all his representatives.
[02:25:47.880 --> 02:25:50.880]  Meanwhile, everybody along the other sides of either side of the roads,
[02:25:50.880 --> 02:25:53.880]  all the USAR teams are all fitted out, right,
[02:25:53.880 --> 02:25:56.880]  with their PPEs to make sure that they're not absorbing this stuff through their skin,
[02:25:56.880 --> 02:25:58.880]  through the air, through whatever else.
[02:25:58.880 --> 02:26:00.880]  That's sending the wrong message.
[02:26:01.880 --> 02:26:05.880]  The other part of it is some of the homes that we've tested in the area for the native Hawaiians,
[02:26:05.880 --> 02:26:08.880]  we've done that as a courtesy, just pro bono.
[02:26:08.880 --> 02:26:10.880]  Let's get a CIA-certified dulcetide genus,
[02:26:10.880 --> 02:26:13.880]  let's pull some samples from inside your living quarters,
[02:26:13.880 --> 02:26:17.880]  your attic, from your bedroom, from the seat can lights,
[02:26:17.880 --> 02:26:20.880]  from your mattress, from the kids' toys.
[02:26:20.880 --> 02:26:26.880]  All the stuff is hitting way hot with carcinogens, highly toxic stuff that is getting blown-
[02:26:26.880 --> 02:26:28.880]  So this is like 9-11 where they covered up the dust.
[02:26:29.880 --> 02:26:30.880]  A hundred percent.
[02:26:30.880 --> 02:26:31.880]  Terrible.
[02:26:31.880 --> 02:26:34.880]  It is a hundred percent that, and that's not inflating it,
[02:26:34.880 --> 02:26:37.880]  the test results show what it is.
[02:26:39.880 --> 02:26:42.880]  So it's going to have a long-term health impact on it,
[02:26:42.880 --> 02:26:45.880]  once the rains kick up, this stuff starts washing into the ocean,
[02:26:45.880 --> 02:26:47.880]  all the heavy metals going into the fish,
[02:26:47.880 --> 02:26:49.880]  this is another environmental disaster,
[02:26:49.880 --> 02:26:52.880]  they're not setting up booms, they're not doing anything on that aspect of it.
[02:26:53.880 --> 02:26:57.880]  Well yeah, I mean Biden said he did a great job, he won't go to East Palestine,
[02:26:57.880 --> 02:27:03.880]  so clearly, total incompetence or premeditated,
[02:27:04.880 --> 02:27:07.880]  this has really gotten the public's attention, that's a good thing.
[02:27:09.880 --> 02:27:12.880]  So let me add one thing to it, so with Archie Kaleppa,
[02:27:12.880 --> 02:27:15.880]  if you know who he is, he's the waterman, right?
[02:27:15.880 --> 02:27:20.880]  The lifeguard that Hurricane Iniki rescued 11 people during the hurricane,
[02:27:20.880 --> 02:27:24.880]  he's the one that invented the ski with the sled and the rescue ski,
[02:27:24.880 --> 02:27:26.880]  he's the one who also invented the toe-in surfing.
[02:27:27.880 --> 02:27:30.880]  Archie Kaleppa is the guy leading the Native Hawaiians,
[02:27:30.880 --> 02:27:34.880]  he's been on multiple meetings with Tulsi Gabbard,
[02:27:34.880 --> 02:27:36.880]  a close personal friend of mine,
[02:27:36.880 --> 02:27:38.880]  as a matter of fact we're doing a paddle out today,
[02:27:38.880 --> 02:27:41.880]  it's one month today since the fire happened,
[02:27:41.880 --> 02:27:45.880]  so the team is taking a break at noon Hawaii time,
[02:27:45.880 --> 02:27:47.880]  and the whole crew is paddling out,
[02:27:47.880 --> 02:27:50.880]  they're doing a helicopter flower drop,
[02:27:51.880 --> 02:27:54.880]  everybody's locking arms, the boat line is going to be showing up,
[02:27:54.880 --> 02:28:01.880]  it's there just to express the respect that we lost.
[02:28:01.880 --> 02:28:04.880]  But on January 20th, the goal here is,
[02:28:04.880 --> 02:28:07.880]  what I'm empowering these Hawaiian people to do,
[02:28:07.880 --> 02:28:09.880]  is to lock arms, right?
[02:28:09.880 --> 02:28:13.880]  So the group put together for January 20th,
[02:28:13.880 --> 02:28:16.880]  they're looking to bring 40,000 people to Maui
[02:28:16.880 --> 02:28:19.880]  to lock arms around the entire fire line,
[02:28:19.880 --> 02:28:22.880]  all the way up into the hills, and all the way down to the coastline.
[02:28:22.880 --> 02:28:25.880]  So, when you keep putting pressure...
[02:28:25.880 --> 02:28:27.880]  Steve, stay there, this is important,
[02:28:27.880 --> 02:28:31.880]  mobilizing the locals to not be taken over by Oprah and Bill Gates,
[02:28:31.880 --> 02:28:33.880]  and The Rock and all of them that want the land,
[02:28:33.880 --> 02:28:36.880]  you're there to mobilize them for their rights,
[02:28:36.880 --> 02:28:37.880]  and to make sure this doesn't happen again.
[02:28:37.880 --> 02:28:39.880]  Because folks, they did this in California,
[02:28:39.880 --> 02:28:41.880]  not cutting the trees back in the last few years,
[02:28:41.880 --> 02:28:42.880]  they know exactly what they're doing,
[02:28:42.880 --> 02:28:44.880]  they're doing it again here,
[02:28:44.880 --> 02:28:49.880]  and it's neglect on purpose, bare minimum.
[02:28:49.880 --> 02:28:50.880]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:14.880 --> 02:29:15.880]  Incredible things for your bones,
[02:29:15.880 --> 02:29:18.880]  incredible things for inflammation, you need it, it's the best,

[02:29:25.880 --> 02:29:29.880]  and X3 limited supply we got, there's like 500 bottles left.
[02:29:29.880 --> 02:29:31.880]  X3, I don't know when we're going to get it back in,
[02:29:31.880 --> 02:29:33.880]  it's hard to manufacture this stuff, it's so high quality,
[02:29:33.880 --> 02:29:36.880]  the missing link is iodine, this is the best iodine you're going to find,
[02:29:36.880 --> 02:29:41.880]  X3 is about to sell out, but I'm keeping it at 40% off,
[02:29:41.880 --> 02:29:43.880]  despite that, this will be sold out probably today.

[02:30:01.880 --> 02:30:03.880]  high quality bone broth there is.

[02:32:01.880 --> 02:32:04.880]  All the success that we've had together against the globalists
[02:32:04.880 --> 02:32:06.880]  and the fact that we're not caught flat-footed
[02:32:06.880 --> 02:32:09.880]  during their major takeover is because of you.
[02:32:09.880 --> 02:32:12.880]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.
[02:32:12.880 --> 02:32:14.880]  I just want to thank you all for buying products

[02:33:02.880 --> 02:33:05.880]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:06.700 --> 02:33:36.700]  Alright, Steve.
[02:33:36.700 --> 02:33:43.700]  Guys, I asked a lot of questions in that last long segment, but just pulling back, the way
[02:33:43.700 --> 02:33:48.340]  they're covering it up, the way they're blocking aid, the way the mayor and the police chief
[02:33:48.340 --> 02:33:52.860]  say don't look at social media, don't ask questions, again, I'm not an emergency manager
[02:33:52.860 --> 02:33:56.700]  like you, but I've been on air 29 years, I cover disasters, I cover this, I know this.
[02:33:56.700 --> 02:34:00.220]  Usually it's like bring any aid you've got if you're a certified group.
[02:34:00.220 --> 02:34:03.700]  What have they done trying to block you coming in, because I know, up until even a
[02:34:03.700 --> 02:34:07.580]  few days ago, like you said, we're a month into this now, people are having to show up
[02:34:07.580 --> 02:34:12.740]  in jet skis, sailboats, motorboats to bring aid in, and then we've had reporters that
[02:34:12.740 --> 02:34:18.980]  live there, you know, real estate agents and stuff, they're videotaping burnt cars
[02:34:18.980 --> 02:34:21.060]  and the police show up and say you can't do that.
[02:34:21.060 --> 02:34:22.460]  That's not America.
[02:34:22.460 --> 02:34:24.100]  What do you really think's going on?
[02:34:24.100 --> 02:34:26.980]  And then just get into all the other general points you want to make, because I'm going
[02:34:26.980 --> 02:34:30.420]  to ask the questions, but I want you to direct where we go now.
[02:34:31.100 --> 02:34:33.100]  Brief thoughts?
[02:34:33.660 --> 02:34:39.740]  As I pointed out earlier, I think you look at some of this stuff, you know, it was the
[02:34:39.740 --> 02:34:45.980]  perfect, horrific storm of issues that led to this tragedy.
[02:34:45.980 --> 02:34:51.300]  That's what it looks like, most of the intel after the laugh, being here almost a month.
[02:34:51.300 --> 02:34:52.780]  And by the way, today is one month.
[02:34:52.780 --> 02:34:55.460]  I didn't know if you knew that or not, but I didn't know if you just said that.
[02:34:55.460 --> 02:34:57.660]  One month ago, today was the fires.
[02:34:57.660 --> 02:35:01.660]  And that first couple of weeks was insane.
[02:35:01.660 --> 02:35:06.540]  And to watch these, we were talking to locals, you know, just basically saying, hey,
[02:35:06.540 --> 02:35:08.340]  listen, what are you seeing out there?
[02:35:08.580 --> 02:35:12.980]  And they would break down crying like they would literally just in front of us just
[02:35:12.980 --> 02:35:13.860]  start sobbing.
[02:35:14.620 --> 02:35:20.140]  And this happened several times where the emotions would just pour out and the urgency
[02:35:20.140 --> 02:35:22.420]  for them was, where's the help?
[02:35:22.900 --> 02:35:27.460]  You know, we're citizens, we're Americans.
[02:35:27.980 --> 02:35:31.900]  We've been here, we were loyal, where's the loyalty to us?
[02:35:31.900 --> 02:35:39.580]  And to watch these people just scrape and grind to try to get support down to their
[02:35:39.580 --> 02:35:43.780]  local brothers and sisters and families, it was terrible.
[02:35:43.780 --> 02:35:48.620]  So from that standpoint, again, these are all head scratchers for us to watch that
[02:35:48.620 --> 02:35:51.860]  kind of just disconnect with the people.
[02:35:52.100 --> 02:35:55.860]  There was one point where they were sending teams in.
[02:35:55.860 --> 02:36:01.100]  I remember this, and there's a group, Steve mentioned Archie Kalepa.
[02:36:01.380 --> 02:36:05.860]  He has a team of generational individuals that are around him.
[02:36:06.060 --> 02:36:08.220]  And there's an area called Hawaiian Homes.
[02:36:08.540 --> 02:36:12.900]  And the government, with all this mistrust already going on, and two weeks
[02:36:12.900 --> 02:36:19.740]  into this, the government sent down FEMA groups to go into their home area.
[02:36:20.380 --> 02:36:22.380]  And they're all masked up, they're all geared up.
[02:36:22.940 --> 02:36:25.300]  But some of them are rightfully so.
[02:36:25.300 --> 02:36:28.020]  They're law enforcement officers, so they have weapons on them.
[02:36:28.020 --> 02:36:30.540]  And they showed up in this community to start walking through.
[02:36:30.540 --> 02:36:35.540]  And they're like, time out, we already don't trust you enough.
[02:36:35.540 --> 02:36:37.340]  And you're going to show up unannounced.
[02:36:37.380 --> 02:36:40.460]  Like, this guy's a leader in this culture.
[02:36:40.460 --> 02:36:42.740]  Yeah, the first thing you do when you show up somewhere, whether you're a
[02:36:42.740 --> 02:36:45.380]  reporter or the police, is you make contact with the locals.
[02:36:46.220 --> 02:36:47.540]  It was insane.
[02:36:47.540 --> 02:36:49.460]  They had to stop and say, you're not going to go, you're going to scare
[02:36:49.460 --> 02:36:51.420]  people, you're going to walk in knocking on doors.
[02:36:51.420 --> 02:36:56.940]  We're just coming in to see what the area, and it was probably rightfully so.
[02:36:56.940 --> 02:36:59.380]  These crews, they mean the best.
[02:36:59.380 --> 02:37:00.780]  They're on a mission.
[02:37:00.780 --> 02:37:01.900]  They have certain things.
[02:37:01.900 --> 02:37:04.900]  But my point is, whoever's sending them in is not giving
[02:37:04.900 --> 02:37:08.740]  them basic sociological etiquette.
[02:37:08.780 --> 02:37:09.540]  It's offensive.
[02:37:09.860 --> 02:37:11.140]  It's literally offensive.
[02:37:11.180 --> 02:37:12.500]  And I'm not even Hawaiian.
[02:37:12.660 --> 02:37:13.580]  I was offended.
[02:37:14.140 --> 02:37:18.660]  I was embarrassed for government at that point when they had been in community.
[02:37:19.020 --> 02:37:19.500]  Here's the thing.
[02:37:19.540 --> 02:37:22.940]  They'd already been in communication with, with, with Archie and his team.
[02:37:23.180 --> 02:37:26.620]  They'd already been talking to him several times, but they can't let him
[02:37:26.620 --> 02:37:29.980]  know that I'm going to send 50 guys and dressed up all.
[02:37:29.980 --> 02:37:31.580]  So Steve, Steve, make your points.
[02:37:31.580 --> 02:37:34.060]  What's the bottom line here is people smell a coverup.
[02:37:34.300 --> 02:37:36.340]  I've seen the meetings, the local government meetings.
[02:37:36.340 --> 02:37:37.300]  No one's buying it.
[02:37:38.220 --> 02:37:42.260]  Whether it's total perfect incompetence or some larger nefarious plan that
[02:37:42.260 --> 02:37:44.980]  you kind of alluded to this, this is, this is big.
[02:37:46.140 --> 02:37:46.340]  Yeah.
[02:37:46.380 --> 02:37:50.820]  So, so if you, if you're constantly lying to the public and the public's finding
[02:37:50.820 --> 02:37:54.260]  out as about your lies and it's being evident because the results don't lie.
[02:37:54.580 --> 02:37:56.220]  People stop trusting the government.
[02:37:56.220 --> 02:37:59.140]  I mean, the local Hawaiians were the Hawaiians were helping the Hawaiians.
[02:37:59.140 --> 02:37:59.540]  Right.
[02:37:59.940 --> 02:38:03.060]  And so they set up their own EOC and they started doing their own
[02:38:03.340 --> 02:38:05.420]  calculations of who they know is missing.
[02:38:05.420 --> 02:38:06.940]  So they're not counting on the government.
[02:38:07.300 --> 02:38:12.460]  And that's why I'm saying this is a very interesting place.
[02:38:12.460 --> 02:38:16.140]  So it was interesting for them as local Hawaiians to reach out to
[02:38:16.140 --> 02:38:19.420]  their Halley brothers going, Hey, I need you because I trust you.
[02:38:19.500 --> 02:38:19.900]  Right.
[02:38:20.260 --> 02:38:24.500]  And so I find that as this thing moves on, we're going to be back at this
[02:38:24.500 --> 02:38:29.060]  video we're talking about today, January 20th, when that whole locking
[02:38:29.060 --> 02:38:33.380]  of the arms of the Hawaiian people, the natives organizing this thing to
[02:38:33.380 --> 02:38:37.020]  bring everybody together, we're going to see exactly where this train is
[02:38:37.020 --> 02:38:38.100]  headed, right?
[02:38:38.220 --> 02:38:41.940]  What track is it set on and what new policies are put in place?
[02:38:42.940 --> 02:38:48.900]  But our job, and I feel like it's my job is to empower them and take all
[02:38:48.900 --> 02:38:51.900]  the knowledge and information I've had from all the past fires, all the
[02:38:51.900 --> 02:38:57.740]  past disasters, how government steps in, how black rock steps in, how
[02:38:57.740 --> 02:39:00.900]  their development part department department step in and buy up these
[02:39:00.900 --> 02:39:01.580]  properties.
[02:39:01.580 --> 02:39:02.100]  Exactly.
[02:39:02.100 --> 02:39:05.980]  We're about to find out because we see the setup, but the confirmation
[02:39:05.980 --> 02:39:06.900]  will be them trying it.
[02:39:07.620 --> 02:39:10.500]  And the governor said two days in, we're going to take the land.
[02:39:10.900 --> 02:39:12.500]  That's, they're so arrogant.
[02:39:12.540 --> 02:39:13.620]  I mean, that's wild.
[02:39:14.740 --> 02:39:19.420]  And I know it firsthand because you know, indirectly, I've been on calls
[02:39:19.420 --> 02:39:23.140]  with the guys at black rock that actually operating the system to buy
[02:39:23.140 --> 02:39:24.060]  into the system.
[02:39:24.540 --> 02:39:28.420]  So I have another call with them coming up and it's interesting because
[02:39:29.220 --> 02:39:31.140]  I know how this program works.
[02:39:31.340 --> 02:39:35.180]  And so when we have a chance, Alex, we could talk about this offline.
[02:39:35.380 --> 02:39:39.340]  I can't put this out there, but we get, I deserve to have a conversation
[02:39:39.340 --> 02:39:42.820]  with you about that specific thing of how this machine is working.
[02:39:43.100 --> 02:39:45.260]  No, I want you to continue to give us updates because we don't even have
[02:39:45.260 --> 02:39:47.220]  the funds to get there and have the crew and do it.
[02:39:47.220 --> 02:39:48.580]  That's how much we're under attack.
[02:39:48.740 --> 02:39:50.260]  But, but just, you guys have the floor.
[02:39:50.260 --> 02:39:53.660]  I'll jump in here, but just, just as American citizens, what does
[02:39:53.660 --> 02:39:56.460]  your gut tell you or the local saying, where do you see this going?
[02:39:56.460 --> 02:39:59.620]  I think you said it, they're already trying to take the land.
[02:40:00.060 --> 02:40:02.900]  And now that the public's awake, this is going to be explosive.
[02:40:03.220 --> 02:40:04.580]  And we're sad people died.
[02:40:04.580 --> 02:40:05.140]  It's terrible.
[02:40:05.140 --> 02:40:08.660]  But this is a beta test like California, where they won't cut the trees around
[02:40:08.660 --> 02:40:11.300]  the power lines in areas, and then it causes the fires.
[02:40:11.300 --> 02:40:13.100]  I mean, this is the rewilding project.
[02:40:13.100 --> 02:40:16.820]  So I think Black Rock's about to run into a brick wall here.
[02:40:18.380 --> 02:40:18.620]  Yeah.
[02:40:18.620 --> 02:40:21.140]  I think that these people are going to, these people are banning together.
[02:40:21.140 --> 02:40:23.780]  The Hawaiian natives are, they're used to wars.
[02:40:23.780 --> 02:40:28.100]  I mean, this is, Lahaina is the capital of the kingdom, the Hawaiian
[02:40:28.100 --> 02:40:30.500]  kingdom from the start in the 1700s, right?
[02:40:30.740 --> 02:40:33.340]  I mean, Archie Kalepa's eighth generation Hawaiian.
[02:40:33.660 --> 02:40:39.180]  So it, this is a place that's going to, I think it's going to come to a massive
[02:40:39.180 --> 02:40:43.260]  turf war and they're hoping that the people are just going to give up their
[02:40:43.260 --> 02:40:43.700]  land.
[02:40:43.700 --> 02:40:47.100]  And I think that, you know, for the people that really say they want to do
[02:40:47.100 --> 02:40:51.420]  right, help them rebuild what they had before, right?
[02:40:51.420 --> 02:40:55.420]  The Oprah's of the world, you know, the Jason Momoa's, all these other
[02:40:55.420 --> 02:40:57.380]  people that are out there that are saying they're going to debase.
[02:40:57.380 --> 02:40:58.460]  That was my next question.
[02:40:58.460 --> 02:40:59.860]  She's worth two and a half million.
[02:40:59.860 --> 02:41:00.940]  He's worth 800 million.
[02:41:01.460 --> 02:41:07.380]  They put 5 million in a piece to a trust that is the, that they get paid back from
[02:41:07.580 --> 02:41:10.900]  then they tell the public to give money that really blew up with their face.
[02:41:11.980 --> 02:41:12.220]  Yeah.
[02:41:12.220 --> 02:41:15.540]  And what they're doing is they're using their influence to try to direct
[02:41:15.980 --> 02:41:19.420]  the way these people are going to rebuild, that if they follow the way
[02:41:19.420 --> 02:41:21.540]  they want it, they'll support it.
[02:41:22.180 --> 02:41:22.700]  You understand?
[02:41:22.700 --> 02:41:26.220]  They're already putting this trajectory to control what it is and how this
[02:41:26.220 --> 02:41:32.100]  little peasantville of workers and low income is going to be their workforce
[02:41:32.100 --> 02:41:33.620]  to support their operations.
[02:41:33.620 --> 02:41:35.300]  And that's the perfect microcosm.
[02:41:35.300 --> 02:41:37.260]  You've got some of the most expensive real estate in the world.
[02:41:37.500 --> 02:41:41.980]  That was a whaling colony and the original seat of the Hawaiian royalty
[02:41:42.180 --> 02:41:44.380]  that was blue collar that wouldn't sell out.
[02:41:44.500 --> 02:41:46.180]  And then this magically happens to them.
[02:41:46.460 --> 02:41:48.020]  I mean, you couldn't make this stuff up.
[02:41:49.460 --> 02:41:51.780]  No, you could, you could, you could listen, you could talk about
[02:41:51.780 --> 02:41:55.340]  things being accidental, negligent, but there.
[02:41:56.620 --> 02:42:01.140]  You can't have this many constant missteps and it not be planned.
[02:42:01.580 --> 02:42:01.860]  Right.
[02:42:01.860 --> 02:42:06.380]  I mean, I'm just, you know, having responded to these things
[02:42:06.380 --> 02:42:10.140]  for 33 years, I've never seen anything ever like this.
[02:42:10.140 --> 02:42:11.260]  And I've never said that.
[02:42:11.700 --> 02:42:17.820]  This is one disaster on another level that is let this shit happen.
[02:42:17.860 --> 02:42:21.820]  Let's sit back and let it slow play because eventually the people
[02:42:21.820 --> 02:42:23.740]  would just give up their property.
[02:42:24.140 --> 02:42:25.380]  They're just going to give up their property.
[02:42:25.380 --> 02:42:27.460]  Let's just have a choice, let these things play out because they
[02:42:27.460 --> 02:42:29.500]  control all the puppet strings out here.
[02:42:29.540 --> 02:42:31.980]  Unless somebody steps in, they won't have a choice because
[02:42:31.980 --> 02:42:35.540]  they don't control the new zoning all over their grandfathered in.
[02:42:35.540 --> 02:42:39.980]  So you've been there a month, you've been there covering this
[02:42:39.980 --> 02:42:42.060]  as a month or a little, a little less than a month.
[02:42:42.660 --> 02:42:45.260]  What is the current exclusion zone?
[02:42:45.260 --> 02:42:46.740]  What is the current coverup like?
[02:42:48.620 --> 02:42:50.620]  Well, right now, I think some of the stuff that's going on
[02:42:50.620 --> 02:42:53.980]  and on the environmental side of it, there's debris that they're
[02:42:53.980 --> 02:42:57.140]  taking off what they call on the phase one, and they're planning
[02:42:57.140 --> 02:43:00.340]  to stage it on a temporary location somewhere on the island.
[02:43:00.940 --> 02:43:03.540]  And we have friends that work on the internal part of that
[02:43:03.540 --> 02:43:04.740]  that are leading that task force.
[02:43:04.740 --> 02:43:07.660]  So once I find them where they're going to put that temporary site on,
[02:43:08.060 --> 02:43:11.100]  I'm going to watch what they're doing with that debris, all those
[02:43:11.100 --> 02:43:12.660]  toxic chemicals, all that stuff.
[02:43:12.660 --> 02:43:13.820]  Where's it being moved?
[02:43:14.020 --> 02:43:17.140]  The phase one toxic dump, where's that being moved?
[02:43:17.140 --> 02:43:19.180]  Is that being buried on the island somewhere that's going
[02:43:19.180 --> 02:43:20.140]  to leach into the water?
[02:43:20.340 --> 02:43:23.700]  And then you have a health issue there that leaches into the ocean.
[02:43:24.020 --> 02:43:27.300]  And the people's drinking water or is it going to be moved off island?
[02:43:27.300 --> 02:43:28.780]  And if so, where is that being dumped?
[02:43:28.780 --> 02:43:30.300]  Where's that toxic site being dumped?
[02:43:30.300 --> 02:43:32.300]  That's one of the biggest concerns we have right now is
[02:43:32.300 --> 02:43:33.500]  really where is that stuff going?
[02:43:33.860 --> 02:43:37.420]  There's all, obviously there's a mistrust because, you know, if you
[02:43:37.420 --> 02:43:40.380]  talk to any Hawaiian out here, they feel like the islands were
[02:43:40.380 --> 02:43:43.060]  stolen anyway by the United States.
[02:43:43.060 --> 02:43:43.860]  Well, I mean, they were.
[02:43:43.860 --> 02:43:46.060]  The US government literally at the point of a gun took it.
[02:43:47.140 --> 02:43:47.420]  Yep.
[02:43:47.500 --> 02:43:49.620]  And they, they, they, they don't forget that.
[02:43:49.660 --> 02:43:54.700]  And this is not, this particular scenario only works to, um, to
[02:43:54.700 --> 02:43:56.540]  foster that, those, those ill feelings.
[02:43:56.540 --> 02:44:02.260]  And so it's very difficult to, to, uh, to really assimilate
[02:44:02.260 --> 02:44:05.340]  with, with the, with the community here, because there is so
[02:44:05.340 --> 02:44:08.460]  much mistrust and I, and we feel it and we felt it when we got here.
[02:44:08.740 --> 02:44:12.660]  Um, I'm not bragging, but they knew who I am.
[02:44:12.940 --> 02:44:15.620]  That's probably one of why when I was a kid, but since I went back
[02:44:15.620 --> 02:44:17.780]  to the popular talk shows, they love me.
[02:44:17.780 --> 02:44:18.580]  They trust me.
[02:44:18.940 --> 02:44:22.180]  Uh, that's why I should probably get out there, but they, they,
[02:44:22.180 --> 02:44:23.700]  they definitely are anti-globalist.
[02:44:25.100 --> 02:44:25.460]  Yeah.
[02:44:25.500 --> 02:44:29.100]  And, and, and I think that the thing that most, what we as Americans can do
[02:44:29.100 --> 02:44:33.380]  is really support our Hawaiian family, right, to really come up behind them,
[02:44:33.420 --> 02:44:35.180]  ask them, what is it you need?
[02:44:35.500 --> 02:44:36.660]  What is it you want?
[02:44:36.780 --> 02:44:39.980]  And how can I be an instrument in supporting you in that?
[02:44:40.180 --> 02:44:43.900]  That's why I feel that putting this message out to your audience
[02:44:44.300 --> 02:44:48.460]  or January 20th, that, that, that this, this arm goes around
[02:44:48.460 --> 02:44:50.260]  this entire fire line, right?
[02:44:50.860 --> 02:44:53.140]  It's going to, it's going to really start pushing it.
[02:44:53.140 --> 02:44:53.900]  And relaunch that.
[02:44:53.900 --> 02:44:55.180]  Cause you talked about it 20 minutes ago.
[02:44:55.540 --> 02:44:57.220]  There's this big event you're talking about.
[02:44:57.220 --> 02:45:00.260]  They put black tarps up all around the town, trying to cover it up.
[02:45:00.460 --> 02:45:01.580]  You're calling for the opposite.
[02:45:01.580 --> 02:45:02.220]  What do people do?
[02:45:03.460 --> 02:45:06.940]  So what we're calling for is on January 20th, there's going to be a unity,
[02:45:06.940 --> 02:45:11.620]  which is being led by the native Hawaiians to create an arm chain of people
[02:45:11.620 --> 02:45:13.660]  around the entire perimeter of the fire.
[02:45:14.020 --> 02:45:18.380]  It's going to be about 40,000 people that are going to send on, on Maui
[02:45:18.820 --> 02:45:21.380]  for January 20th for that event.
[02:45:21.780 --> 02:45:23.380]  And it's unity Maui.
[02:45:23.380 --> 02:45:27.700]  So once I have the deep, the more details, it's already well into the
[02:45:27.700 --> 02:45:32.140]  works, it's coming together beautifully, but it's there for the Hawaiian people
[02:45:32.380 --> 02:45:34.820]  to make that line because they're protecting this right.
[02:45:34.820 --> 02:45:39.300]  I mean, this is definitely a test as firefighters or as emergency experts.
[02:45:40.140 --> 02:45:43.060]  I get the power lines fell down in the fire and they didn't, they
[02:45:43.100 --> 02:45:45.620]  blocked people in the town and they didn't give them water.
[02:45:45.620 --> 02:45:46.980]  And they didn't turn the emergency alerts.
[02:45:47.300 --> 02:45:48.420]  Looking at those fires.
[02:45:48.420 --> 02:45:51.420]  I'm not a firefighter, but I see, I didn't believe the direct energy
[02:45:51.420 --> 02:45:52.700]  stuff when they first said it.
[02:45:52.980 --> 02:45:56.620]  But then I see grass everywhere, trees and hundreds of yards away from
[02:45:56.620 --> 02:45:58.940]  fires. Cars are totally melted.
[02:45:58.940 --> 02:46:00.020]  What does that?
[02:46:02.220 --> 02:46:06.740]  There there's definitely some videos out there that I can't explain, so I'll
[02:46:06.740 --> 02:46:10.020]  just say there's definitely a number of things that are being that are being
[02:46:10.020 --> 02:46:15.420]  pushed out over as a 30 year firefighter, a fire chief, you're saying
[02:46:15.420 --> 02:46:17.460]  you've seen things you can't explain elaborate on that.
[02:46:18.340 --> 02:46:21.780]  That just some of the videos and stuff that you've seen on social
[02:46:21.780 --> 02:46:26.780]  media, it's hard to put your finger on why a car is isolated in an area.
[02:46:27.060 --> 02:46:29.620]  The the the engine block is melted.
[02:46:30.060 --> 02:46:34.540]  There's no potential for radiant heat that you can see in that scenario.
[02:46:34.540 --> 02:46:38.460]  So logically speaking from, from a fire dynamic standpoint, it doesn't
[02:46:38.460 --> 02:46:40.100]  look like something could could do that.
[02:46:40.340 --> 02:46:45.660]  But by and large, Alex, this this this looks again like a perfect storm.
[02:46:45.660 --> 02:46:48.820]  You're talking about a fire that's being laid down by 70 mile an hour
[02:46:48.820 --> 02:46:52.420]  winds, plenty of fuel and nothing to stop it.
[02:46:52.420 --> 02:46:54.340]  And that's where you're outside of fire.
[02:46:54.340 --> 02:46:57.100]  I'm not a firefighter like you, but you're five feet from a fire.
[02:46:57.100 --> 02:46:58.100]  You feel that heat.
[02:46:58.300 --> 02:46:59.820]  There was just so much heat coming over.
[02:47:00.620 --> 02:47:01.420]  It will melt.
[02:47:01.420 --> 02:47:02.740]  It will melt a fire engine.
[02:47:02.740 --> 02:47:03.380]  It'll melt things.
[02:47:03.660 --> 02:47:06.860]  It'll just take radiant heat in just a general.
[02:47:07.220 --> 02:47:10.580]  You have to be careful where you put an apparatus at one single commercial
[02:47:10.580 --> 02:47:11.300]  structure fire.
[02:47:11.580 --> 02:47:14.900]  If the rating if you're too close, you're going to damage that vehicle.
[02:47:15.180 --> 02:47:16.380]  So think about that.
[02:47:16.660 --> 02:47:19.220]  Plus added oxygen, added fuel.
[02:47:20.220 --> 02:47:22.020]  The fire can't escape.
[02:47:22.020 --> 02:47:23.220]  The heat's laid down.
[02:47:24.220 --> 02:47:26.580]  That's how that's how blacksmiths work.
[02:47:26.580 --> 02:47:28.380]  You put air into a fire.
[02:47:28.380 --> 02:47:29.100]  It makes it harder.
[02:47:29.860 --> 02:47:30.620]  Exactly.
[02:47:30.620 --> 02:47:34.940]  So this is where this is what create this what to me looks like it created
[02:47:34.940 --> 02:47:38.500]  what I which typically wouldn't see in a fire that the poems being
[02:47:38.500 --> 02:47:42.620]  burned to the ground because the fire just had nowhere else but to
[02:47:42.620 --> 02:47:43.700]  lay down on itself.
[02:47:44.020 --> 02:47:45.300]  And it was continued fuel fuel.
[02:47:45.500 --> 02:47:48.060]  This thing jumped amazing distances.
[02:47:48.420 --> 02:47:51.220]  Normally in a in a in Steve will tell you this as well.
[02:47:51.620 --> 02:47:54.820]  He's he's got great experience with with wild wild wild and flyer
[02:47:54.820 --> 02:47:59.060]  fires from from his standpoint as well that things will will jump.
[02:47:59.100 --> 02:48:00.380]  These these brands will jump.
[02:48:00.420 --> 02:48:02.100]  Well imagine 70 mile an hour jump.
[02:48:02.380 --> 02:48:03.580]  That's how fast this thing was.
[02:48:03.580 --> 02:48:04.980]  People could not get out of the way.
[02:48:05.340 --> 02:48:08.660]  I am really infuriated about the alarms not being sounded for sure
[02:48:08.900 --> 02:48:12.140]  because this was this was a perfect example of a all hazards alarm.
[02:48:13.020 --> 02:48:13.340]  Needed.
[02:48:13.340 --> 02:48:14.500]  And we saw the mayor.
[02:48:14.540 --> 02:48:18.940]  I'm not a rocket scientist, but if you raise an alarm, which is the best
[02:48:18.940 --> 02:48:22.340]  alarm system in the US, you see fire coming at you, you know the what
[02:48:22.340 --> 02:48:23.220]  the alarm saying.
[02:48:23.460 --> 02:48:26.260]  So the idea is I didn't sound it because you'd run towards the fire.
[02:48:26.500 --> 02:48:27.420]  That doesn't make sense.
[02:48:28.420 --> 02:48:29.180]  That's insanity.
[02:48:29.420 --> 02:48:32.340]  They would know why as soon as they stepped out of their house, if they
[02:48:32.380 --> 02:48:32.940]  were able to.
[02:48:33.860 --> 02:48:35.140]  We got about 10 minutes left.
[02:48:35.180 --> 02:48:39.900]  You guys just dump your guts here as experts in emergency management
[02:48:39.900 --> 02:48:42.620]  and firefighting about what went down here, what we should do.
[02:48:44.900 --> 02:48:47.740]  You know, you know, the thing is, this is happening more and more,
[02:48:47.740 --> 02:48:48.580]  Alex, right?
[02:48:48.900 --> 02:48:50.380]  It's not just the fires.
[02:48:50.700 --> 02:48:53.420]  You see, like in that area, all the comms went out, right?
[02:48:53.420 --> 02:48:55.620]  So no one could actually contact loved ones.
[02:48:56.060 --> 02:48:59.500]  And so I always tell people every one area disaster, including, you
[02:48:59.500 --> 02:49:02.940]  know, Ian Ida, this last one in Dahlia, right, then you see this
[02:49:02.940 --> 02:49:05.980]  lead, this hurricane that may join forces with another one
[02:49:05.980 --> 02:49:07.380]  that's pushing behind it, right?
[02:49:07.620 --> 02:49:09.820]  I always tell people, you know what, get a family plan together
[02:49:09.820 --> 02:49:14.620]  because it's not just the hurricanes, but if what we see
[02:49:14.620 --> 02:49:17.780]  going into 2024, you better have a family plan together.
[02:49:17.780 --> 02:49:20.140]  You better have sat phones for every one of your family members.
[02:49:20.140 --> 02:49:22.540]  We have it, I have it for my wife and my kids, right?
[02:49:22.860 --> 02:49:24.260]  Everyone's phone numbers are plugged.
[02:49:24.260 --> 02:49:27.620]  Every one of the team members on SRP, every one of our vendors,
[02:49:27.860 --> 02:49:30.220]  fuel, power, security, everyone.
[02:49:30.220 --> 02:49:32.580]  And we do a quarterly call with everybody, right?
[02:49:32.660 --> 02:49:34.220]  Everybody knows what the meeting points are.
[02:49:34.540 --> 02:49:38.820]  Get your shit, get your house in order, get your house in order,
[02:49:38.900 --> 02:49:42.260]  have a plan that's going to be non-verbal and verbal, right?
[02:49:42.420 --> 02:49:45.940]  Because the one thing that I see is so many lives were lost in this
[02:49:46.180 --> 02:49:47.780]  because they didn't know what was going on.
[02:49:47.780 --> 02:49:49.620]  They didn't know what direction it was going on.
[02:49:49.860 --> 02:49:53.340]  And the fact that so many kids were lost and people are not talking
[02:49:53.340 --> 02:49:57.380]  about it, I mean, there's so much pain in these people's eyes that
[02:49:57.380 --> 02:49:59.780]  we see here on a daily basis.
[02:49:59.780 --> 02:50:01.420]  It's, it's, it's, it's horrific.
[02:50:02.020 --> 02:50:03.460]  It's something that should never happen.
[02:50:03.460 --> 02:50:06.420]  So I'm saying don't wait on the government.
[02:50:06.460 --> 02:50:08.700]  I mean, look, even if you go back to Northridge, right?
[02:50:08.700 --> 02:50:15.340]  1994 LA, the Northridge earthquake, seven seconds, the entire fire
[02:50:15.340 --> 02:50:19.340]  department was maxed out in seven seconds, they're not coming for you.
[02:50:19.740 --> 02:50:21.820]  Law enforcement's not showing up at your house.
[02:50:22.740 --> 02:50:26.340]  Get your house in order, get prepared, get ready and be prepared that
[02:50:26.340 --> 02:50:30.180]  if you want to stop an uprising, turn your cell phones off, turn
[02:50:30.180 --> 02:50:32.340]  social media off, no one's moving.
[02:50:32.820 --> 02:50:35.660]  Learn how to operate without this, without this cell phone,
[02:50:35.700 --> 02:50:36.980]  learn how to operate without it.
[02:50:37.740 --> 02:50:40.780]  I would say this in closing also, just as we're talking about the
[02:50:40.780 --> 02:50:44.940]  firefighters and the law enforcement, these were, these are Hawaiians.
[02:50:44.980 --> 02:50:46.260]  These were people from Maui.
[02:50:46.820 --> 02:50:48.300]  These are brothers and sisters.
[02:50:48.300 --> 02:50:49.820]  These are part, they're part of the community.
[02:50:50.140 --> 02:50:52.780]  And when you talk to the firefighters, they were just as
[02:50:52.780 --> 02:50:54.100]  desperate as everybody else was.
[02:50:54.380 --> 02:50:57.980]  This was a, this was a difficult scenario for all of everybody.
[02:50:57.980 --> 02:51:01.660]  And the firefighters, the first responders, the people that they tried
[02:51:01.660 --> 02:51:05.340]  their hardest to stop this thing from, from getting to the place that it got
[02:51:05.340 --> 02:51:08.980]  to and the conversations that we've had with, with these front line
[02:51:08.980 --> 02:51:12.380]  workers, you can see it in their face that there's a, there's a,
[02:51:12.420 --> 02:51:14.100]  there's a weight of responsibility.
[02:51:14.100 --> 02:51:16.940]  They understood that they needed to be there for their community
[02:51:16.980 --> 02:51:17.900]  and they couldn't get there.
[02:51:17.900 --> 02:51:19.220]  They couldn't do what they needed to do.
[02:51:19.460 --> 02:51:20.460]  Firefighters got trapped.
[02:51:20.780 --> 02:51:22.060]  There's some videos out there as well.
[02:51:22.060 --> 02:51:26.180]  And they were clearly, thankfully saved, but they got trapped in the
[02:51:26.180 --> 02:51:27.460]  fire trying to put this thing out.
[02:51:27.540 --> 02:51:31.060]  And I, I just want to throw that out that, um, um, there's some
[02:51:31.060 --> 02:51:32.100]  great people in the federal.
[02:51:32.100 --> 02:51:32.940]  No, you're absolutely right.
[02:51:32.940 --> 02:51:35.140]  We don't blame the individual firefighters or police.
[02:51:35.140 --> 02:51:36.140]  They're compartmentalized.
[02:51:36.380 --> 02:51:37.460]  You're on a radio.
[02:51:37.580 --> 02:51:39.060]  You're told go block this road.
[02:51:39.420 --> 02:51:43.260]  Other cops are told block that road in the town as the fire is coming.
[02:51:44.020 --> 02:51:48.180]  So we know the emergency manager was in Honolulu at a meeting.
[02:51:48.180 --> 02:51:49.620]  So was the other emergency manager.
[02:51:49.980 --> 02:51:52.660]  So who, we need an investigation of who gave the orders.
[02:51:52.860 --> 02:51:54.980]  We're not blaming individual officers or firefighters.
[02:51:55.180 --> 02:51:57.420]  They were just sent where they were supposed to go, but it was
[02:51:57.420 --> 02:51:58.460]  perfectly done.
[02:51:58.460 --> 02:51:59.900]  I mean, that's why you look at it.
[02:52:00.300 --> 02:52:03.740]  I mean, who would say when a fires at people's backs and the
[02:52:03.740 --> 02:52:06.700]  highways open and you block people in, I don't know.
[02:52:06.700 --> 02:52:07.580]  I don't know how you do that,
[02:52:09.460 --> 02:52:12.860]  but it's also shown the, uh, a lot of the people on the front line, as
[02:52:12.860 --> 02:52:18.460]  far as the first responders that leadership and upper management, uh,
[02:52:19.340 --> 02:52:21.100]  they may not be on the same page.
[02:52:21.900 --> 02:52:25.980]  So if anything's shared, you know, put a big spotlight on this thing
[02:52:25.980 --> 02:52:30.660]  about it is that people have to start looking out for the people
[02:52:30.660 --> 02:52:32.180]  and for themselves, you know,
[02:52:34.460 --> 02:52:39.340]  you have a hurricane with 70, 80 mile an hour winds, dry news, admitting
[02:52:39.340 --> 02:52:43.180]  mass fires, and the main managers go to Honolulu for a party.
[02:52:43.660 --> 02:52:45.860]  That's that's negligent right there.
[02:52:46.660 --> 02:52:47.980]  Extreme negligence.
[02:52:48.420 --> 02:52:50.580]  Uh, they've, they've got to go to jail.
[02:52:50.620 --> 02:52:53.580]  So other managers don't think, Hey, a hurricane's hitting us.
[02:52:53.580 --> 02:52:54.420]  We got dry stuff.
[02:52:54.580 --> 02:52:55.940]  They're predicting massive fires.
[02:52:55.940 --> 02:52:58.580]  I'm going to go party at a hotel on the next island.
[02:52:58.620 --> 02:53:00.100]  It's just, it's insane.
[02:53:00.340 --> 02:53:04.660]  And then whoever gave the orders, it's, it's, it's, it's hard to believe
[02:53:04.660 --> 02:53:08.340]  they gave orders this bad because it's so perfect because the locals
[02:53:08.340 --> 02:53:10.700]  are saying at the city council meetings and everything, they're
[02:53:10.700 --> 02:53:15.140]  saying it's so perfect and it's so screwed up because you're, you're
[02:53:15.140 --> 02:53:18.260]  locked in a town, the fires behind you, the cops are told, sorry,
[02:53:18.460 --> 02:53:19.780]  I'm told to keep you from going.
[02:53:19.980 --> 02:53:22.100]  And I was a cop and fire is rushing.
[02:53:22.500 --> 02:53:25.540]  They said a hundred yards away, the buildings are burning down and
[02:53:25.540 --> 02:53:29.460]  you don't let people out that I don't, I don't know how it's, it's bizarre.
[02:53:30.540 --> 02:53:33.180]  One thing to think about on, on the law enforcement side, and these
[02:53:33.180 --> 02:53:38.740]  officers, um, in a normal situation, when a power line goes down situation,
[02:53:38.780 --> 02:53:42.300]  when a power line goes down, you do want to protect that area.
[02:53:42.300 --> 02:53:45.860]  It's a dangerous for fire for a vehicle to go through a potentially
[02:53:45.860 --> 02:53:47.380]  powered up power line area.
[02:53:47.740 --> 02:53:50.540]  Um, the problem, the problem is, is that happened in multiple, in
[02:53:50.540 --> 02:53:54.580]  several locations, two or several locations on that, on that front
[02:53:54.620 --> 02:53:55.620]  street, as I understand.
[02:53:55.900 --> 02:53:58.820]  And, and, and it happened because it happened that the, both law
[02:53:58.820 --> 02:54:01.740]  enforcement officers did the same thing they would normally do with a
[02:54:01.740 --> 02:54:04.740]  power line down, they redirected traffic and they pushed people back
[02:54:04.740 --> 02:54:06.620]  into, uh, the, the fire.
[02:54:06.620 --> 02:54:08.700]  They didn't know they, and they weren't communicating between each other.
[02:54:08.700 --> 02:54:09.580]  This is what I understood.
[02:54:09.820 --> 02:54:15.780]  So it wasn't like somebody shut down the, the exit paths on purpose.
[02:54:15.900 --> 02:54:18.460]  They were just following what their normal procedure would be and
[02:54:18.460 --> 02:54:21.660]  not using common sense that say, Hey, this is, this is the only
[02:54:22.140 --> 02:54:24.260]  200 foot flames, a hundred yards away.
[02:54:24.460 --> 02:54:26.300]  I'm going to follow orders and not let people through.
[02:54:27.780 --> 02:54:28.060]  Right.
[02:54:28.060 --> 02:54:30.740]  It doesn't, it doesn't, it doesn't add up and eventually
[02:54:30.740 --> 02:54:31.900]  that was changed or fixed.
[02:54:31.940 --> 02:54:34.020]  Well, there's, there's one of the individuals who we know personally,
[02:54:34.020 --> 02:54:35.220]  who actually confronted the cop.
[02:54:35.220 --> 02:54:37.620]  Cause he drove on the side of the road, went around the traffic that
[02:54:37.620 --> 02:54:40.500]  was backed up for like an hour and a half to the front of the cops
[02:54:40.500 --> 02:54:43.540]  said, Hey, of all places that you parked your car, you're parking
[02:54:43.540 --> 02:54:44.740]  where the power lines are not.
[02:54:44.740 --> 02:54:46.020]  It's the only exit out.
[02:54:46.580 --> 02:54:48.220]  Move your car.
[02:54:48.500 --> 02:54:48.700]  Yeah.
[02:54:48.900 --> 02:54:51.300]  At that point, the guy saw that the crowd was actually starting
[02:54:51.300 --> 02:54:52.140]  to come up against him.
[02:54:52.460 --> 02:54:55.140]  He moved his vehicle at the car, moved his vehicle.
[02:54:55.140 --> 02:54:57.860]  He was the first one through and then traffic, whatever was
[02:54:57.860 --> 02:54:59.460]  behind it, we're starting to move.
[02:54:59.740 --> 02:55:01.660]  But the problem is a lot of people that got backed up in this
[02:55:01.660 --> 02:55:04.860]  traffic turned around, went the other way, or they will turn around.
[02:55:04.860 --> 02:55:05.860]  They bailed from their vehicles.
[02:55:05.860 --> 02:55:06.300]  Awesome.
[02:55:06.660 --> 02:55:09.380]  So it's the complexity of industrial society.
[02:55:09.380 --> 02:55:09.940]  It's great.
[02:55:10.140 --> 02:55:13.340]  We have running water, we have toilets, we have antibiotics, but
[02:55:13.340 --> 02:55:14.900]  it makes it really perilous.
[02:55:15.220 --> 02:55:17.660]  Gentlemen, we only got a minute left or two minutes left.
[02:55:17.700 --> 02:55:20.620]  Each one of you closing comment, plug websites, some people support.
[02:55:20.620 --> 02:55:21.020]  What do we do?
[02:55:22.300 --> 02:55:22.460]  Yeah.
[02:55:22.460 --> 02:55:26.300]  I mean, you know, I put a page just for personal planning.
[02:55:26.300 --> 02:55:32.460]  If you go to SRP24.com forward slash prepare, that's just a good, a good
[02:55:32.460 --> 02:55:35.620]  site of an area to, to get some of your, your stuff put together.
[02:55:35.620 --> 02:55:37.740]  There's no affiliate links on it.
[02:55:37.780 --> 02:55:40.180]  I just, for us, it's just the stuff that we use.
[02:55:40.260 --> 02:55:40.700]  Right.
[02:55:41.100 --> 02:55:45.220]  And the main thing that I can honestly say is just, just get your family
[02:55:45.220 --> 02:55:50.540]  prepared, get organized, be a part of a community of either be a CERT,
[02:55:50.540 --> 02:55:54.940]  get CERT certified, know what's going on on your local level and get involved.
[02:55:54.940 --> 02:55:59.020]  Get involved with the, you know, see what the emergency plan is for your city,
[02:55:59.020 --> 02:56:02.540]  for your county, you know, for the state, get familiar with those things.
[02:56:02.540 --> 02:56:04.300]  Get familiar with alternate routes.
[02:56:04.460 --> 02:56:06.860]  If something goes down, which way are you going to use that?
[02:56:06.860 --> 02:56:10.660]  You're going to get out of that area without having to use main thoroughfares.
[02:56:10.860 --> 02:56:13.260]  And that may be like a river basin.
[02:56:13.300 --> 02:56:14.500]  Um, another area.
[02:56:15.380 --> 02:56:16.260]  Have an escape plan.
[02:56:17.100 --> 02:56:17.900]  Absolutely.
[02:56:18.660 --> 02:56:21.300]  For me, I just want to thank you one month out.
[02:56:21.340 --> 02:56:24.100]  Here you are bringing this topic back up again.
[02:56:24.100 --> 02:56:27.500]  And I think that if you can talk to your, the, the, the colleagues that you
[02:56:27.500 --> 02:56:30.900]  work with across the aisle and say, we've got, we've got to keep this
[02:56:30.900 --> 02:56:32.500]  relevant for the, for the Maui people.
[02:56:32.500 --> 02:56:33.500]  I think that's important.
[02:56:33.500 --> 02:56:36.460]  So as we move forward, uh, you're continuing to continue to
[02:56:36.460 --> 02:56:38.780]  attention on this is, is so important.
[02:56:38.940 --> 02:56:40.620]  Oh, we're not going to forget about Lahaina.
[02:56:40.620 --> 02:56:43.380]  We're not going to forget about this because this is administrative
[02:56:43.380 --> 02:56:46.260]  mass murder through incompetence or by deliberate stuff.
[02:56:46.260 --> 02:56:49.660]  The good news is they're rejecting Oprah and Bill Gates and all their
[02:56:49.660 --> 02:56:51.700]  crap, a thousand dollar a night.
[02:56:51.740 --> 02:56:54.540]  FEMA at the four seasons owned by Bill Gates.
[02:56:54.540 --> 02:56:55.420]  People see through it.
[02:56:55.660 --> 02:56:56.820]  God bless you, gentlemen.
[02:56:57.060 --> 02:56:58.500]  Give us updates as this develops.
[02:56:58.500 --> 02:56:58.940]  Thank you.
[02:57:00.140 --> 02:57:00.620]  Thank you.
[02:57:00.660 --> 02:57:01.540]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:57:01.860 --> 02:57:03.980]  Thank you, gentlemen, Steve and Sam.
[02:57:04.020 --> 02:57:04.500]  All right.
[02:57:04.980 --> 02:57:06.220]  I'm going to end this hour.
[02:57:06.380 --> 02:57:07.580]  We got a guest host coming up.
[02:57:07.580 --> 02:57:10.660]  I'm gonna do a few more minutes after this with some other stories we have
[02:57:10.660 --> 02:57:15.660]  at the head and then the guest host can take over and, uh, I got to go
[02:57:15.660 --> 02:57:17.420]  see Owen right after I get off here.
[02:57:17.460 --> 02:57:18.300]  I love Owen so much.
[02:57:18.300 --> 02:57:19.180]  He's such a man.
[02:57:19.180 --> 02:57:20.020]  He's so good.
[02:57:20.500 --> 02:57:21.860]  Like he's like, it's boy scout.
[02:57:21.860 --> 02:57:24.340]  It's like, this is like the art type.
[02:57:24.340 --> 02:57:26.900]  Only think of an FBI agent would be in the fifties and they're
[02:57:26.900 --> 02:57:28.060]  trying to put him in jail next week.
[02:57:28.060 --> 02:57:30.220]  I got to go talk to him and say, what do you want me to do?
[02:57:30.220 --> 02:57:32.780]  Cause you know, it's just, they're all with the news.
[02:57:32.780 --> 02:57:34.500]  They're just thirsty for his blood.
[02:57:35.060 --> 02:57:35.980]  So I got to do that as well.
[02:57:35.980 --> 02:57:38.180]  Owen comes up in one hour in full words.
[02:57:38.180 --> 02:57:39.620]  Dot com slash show the war room.
[02:57:40.140 --> 02:57:41.380]  Jay Dyer is ready.

[02:58:52.420 --> 02:58:55.500]  And that's because the prices went up too high for the raw beans
[02:58:55.500 --> 02:58:56.580]  and the quality had gone down.
[02:58:56.580 --> 02:59:00.460]  Some I turned down so many companies that wanted to work with us, but

[03:00:01.980 --> 03:00:02.380]  All right.
[03:00:02.380 --> 03:00:06.620]  Final segment here before I hand it to the amazing expert of the new world
[03:00:06.620 --> 03:00:11.260]  order, Jay Dyer here today from Jay's analysis, but let me just say this here.
[03:00:12.260 --> 03:00:18.540]  Uh, evil is incompetent, but it also is an organized crisis.
[03:00:19.460 --> 03:00:21.180]  And so they know humanity is waking up.
[03:00:21.660 --> 03:00:26.060]  They know that if we're successful financially, we're
[03:00:26.060 --> 03:00:29.180]  more easily going to resist them.
[03:00:30.780 --> 03:00:33.180]  But if they control us and dumb us down to make us poor,
[03:00:33.380 --> 03:00:34.700]  it's harder for us to stand up.
[03:00:35.540 --> 03:00:39.740]  So it's an anti Renaissance, anti Western system.
[03:00:41.940 --> 03:00:44.660]  And that's why I can sit here all day and talk to listeners and viewers
[03:00:44.660 --> 03:00:46.740]  about how important this broadcast is.
[03:00:46.740 --> 03:00:52.900]  But have we not delivered our guests, our crew, our callers that we have.
[03:00:54.140 --> 03:00:56.380]  And we have the light in the dark of the night.
[03:00:56.420 --> 03:00:59.100]  We, we, we care about people.
[03:00:59.700 --> 03:01:04.540]  Um, we're not globalist and we just respectfully ask you to

[03:02:13.980 --> 03:02:16.860]  Cause it's, it's a DEA thing and it's so pure.
[03:02:17.300 --> 03:02:19.140]  Everybody else says they have atomic iodine.
[03:02:19.140 --> 03:02:20.740]  They don't, it's a DEA control deal.
[03:02:20.900 --> 03:02:22.060]  We got a new manufacturer.
[03:02:22.060 --> 03:02:23.300]  They've gone through hell to make it.
[03:02:23.780 --> 03:02:24.700]  The testing's done.
[03:02:24.700 --> 03:02:26.140]  It's like 99% done.
[03:02:26.460 --> 03:02:27.620]  Supposed to be done six months ago.
[03:02:27.620 --> 03:02:29.300]  It's not, I mean, we would have it for you.
[03:02:29.860 --> 03:02:32.140]  We'd say something's atomic iodine all day long.
[03:02:32.140 --> 03:02:34.940]  It's not atomic iodine goes right into your cells.
[03:02:36.220 --> 03:02:38.820]  We do have a manufacturer that has a small supply of atomic iodine.
[03:02:38.820 --> 03:02:39.540]  That's X three.
[03:02:40.620 --> 03:02:44.020]  It's that and two other types that helps with the upload, but X two is the
[03:02:44.020 --> 03:02:48.500]  bigger enchilada who knows what we never have it because this is something
[03:02:48.500 --> 03:02:51.900]  developed and launched by our researchers and doctor group.

[03:02:53.300 --> 03:02:54.180]  I mean, I don't know.

[03:03:24.060 --> 03:03:25.300]  I'm at point blank range.
[03:03:26.180 --> 03:03:27.500]  I'm not playing games.
[03:03:27.860 --> 03:03:29.900]  I'm not sitting here and doing easy street.
[03:03:30.060 --> 03:03:31.140]  I'm not selling out.
[03:03:31.140 --> 03:03:32.860]  I am totally committed.
[03:03:32.860 --> 03:03:37.700]  We've already had devastating victories and like a rocket upon the ripple effects of
[03:03:37.700 --> 03:03:42.740]  what we've already done 20 years ago, 10 years ago, 29 years ago is already coming
[03:03:42.740 --> 03:03:43.700]  back to us huge.
[03:03:44.260 --> 03:03:48.500]  That's why I know now, oh, my gosh, the rocks we throw in now are even bigger.
[03:03:48.900 --> 03:03:49.700]  And that's not me.
[03:03:49.700 --> 03:03:50.460]  That's God.
[03:03:50.460 --> 03:03:51.300]  That's the Holy Spirit.
[03:03:51.300 --> 03:03:52.140]  That's all of us together.
[03:03:52.140 --> 03:03:55.900]  But we are like Godzilla fighting Megalon.

[03:05:56.800 --> 03:06:06.679]  Welcome back to the fourth hour of Alex Jones.
[03:06:06.679 --> 03:06:08.679]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[03:06:08.679 --> 03:06:13.880]  I want to rewind and go back a little bit to the history of modern revolutionary philosophy.
[03:06:13.880 --> 03:06:18.039]  Then we'll work our way up to today and we'll see how that revolutionary philosophy
[03:06:18.039 --> 03:06:27.359]  is at work in the establishment's plans for austerity, ESG, lockdowns, and all the measures
[03:06:27.359 --> 03:06:30.400]  they want to put in place to enforce a technocracy.
[03:06:30.400 --> 03:06:37.160]  If we go back to this famous text that I always recommend written by a defender of the establishment,
[03:06:37.160 --> 03:06:42.960]  Fire in the Minds of Men by James Billington, the origins of the revolutionary faith.
[03:06:42.960 --> 03:06:47.000]  He's of course not a conspiracy theorist, but a person who was, as an academic and
[03:06:47.000 --> 03:06:52.480]  a historian, archiving and chronicling the history of revolutionary philosophy and thought
[03:06:52.480 --> 03:06:57.080]  from the time of the French Revolution all the way up until the early 20th century.
[03:06:57.080 --> 03:07:02.640]  James Billington noted that to really understand today's revolutionary philosophies, you have
[03:07:02.640 --> 03:07:08.039]  to go back to the faith of the original revolutionaries at the time of and right
[03:07:08.039 --> 03:07:10.800]  before the French Revolution and their influences.
[03:07:10.800 --> 03:07:11.800]  What were they influenced by?
[03:07:11.800 --> 03:07:16.039]  Well, they were influenced by philosophies like Platonism.
[03:07:16.039 --> 03:07:24.279]  There was a Byzantine Platonist named Plethon that influenced Spinoza, that influenced Vyshop
[03:07:24.279 --> 03:07:26.359]  and other Jacobins.
[03:07:26.359 --> 03:07:32.880]  And the philosophy of Pythagoras played a key element, as well as the philosophies
[03:07:32.880 --> 03:07:35.840]  of ancient pre-Socratics like Heraclitus.
[03:07:35.840 --> 03:07:39.660]  Heraclitus taught that all is fire and all is flux.
[03:07:39.660 --> 03:07:45.779]  And so, one of the things that the early Illuminists, people like Vyshop and a guy
[03:07:45.779 --> 03:07:51.460]  called Buonarodi, who were really influential on the Jacobins in the French Revolution,
[03:07:51.460 --> 03:07:57.259]  they decided to take certain symbols from ancient mystical religions like the Zoroastrians
[03:07:57.259 --> 03:08:03.179]  and Zoroastrianism is a dualistic religion that believes there's always these two principles
[03:08:03.179 --> 03:08:07.259]  eternally fighting with each other throughout history and that never ends.
[03:08:07.259 --> 03:08:11.480]  It's an eternal dualistic dialectical battle.
[03:08:11.480 --> 03:08:16.580]  That becomes kind of the basis for later Hermetic philosophers like Hegel, who will
[03:08:16.580 --> 03:08:18.699]  influence people like Marx.
[03:08:18.699 --> 03:08:22.220]  But before we get to that, we have to understand that the French Revolutionary philosophers
[03:08:22.220 --> 03:08:27.380]  had a radical view of equalitarianism across society.
[03:08:27.380 --> 03:08:33.779]  And they thought that because, well, what's the best way to fix man's ills?
[03:08:33.779 --> 03:08:39.560]  Man's ills relate to believing in any kind of hierarchy at all, in the hierarchy of church
[03:08:39.560 --> 03:08:41.859]  and state.
[03:08:41.859 --> 03:08:47.580]  And so, if we get rid of that and we put in place a radical egalitarian and equalitarian
[03:08:47.580 --> 03:08:53.980]  society, perhaps a form of utopia could develop or could be imagined.
[03:08:53.980 --> 03:08:59.300]  And so, this is where entities like Masonic lodges and secret societies at that time
[03:08:59.300 --> 03:09:05.220]  began to be useful to certain revolutionaries to try to spread their revolutionary ideas
[03:09:05.220 --> 03:09:08.660]  against the notions of nobility and aristocracy.
[03:09:08.660 --> 03:09:13.119]  However, some of these were extremely radical in their views to the extent that they
[03:09:13.119 --> 03:09:19.060]  even believed that all things should be held in common, including wives and children.
[03:09:19.060 --> 03:09:23.740]  And one of the things they did was they took the doctrine of fire from Zoroastrians
[03:09:23.740 --> 03:09:27.679]  and from Manichaeans to be a symbol of their religion.
[03:09:27.679 --> 03:09:30.199]  Because if you think about it, fire is always kind of moving.
[03:09:30.199 --> 03:09:31.199]  It's hot.
[03:09:31.199 --> 03:09:34.740]  It never ceases to, it never comes to any rest.
[03:09:34.740 --> 03:09:39.359]  And so, it's a perfect image for the old Heraklesian idea, the pre-Socratics of
[03:09:39.359 --> 03:09:42.500]  the philosophers, that everything is flux.
[03:09:42.500 --> 03:09:43.599]  Nothing is true.
[03:09:43.599 --> 03:09:44.840]  Nothing is stable.
[03:09:44.840 --> 03:09:48.039]  Everything is perpetual revolution and change.
[03:09:48.039 --> 03:09:52.240]  And so, the religion itself becomes change.
[03:09:52.240 --> 03:09:58.279]  The journey is the end, some of the Marxists have said in history.
[03:09:58.279 --> 03:10:04.199]  They borrowed their model on how to structure this inner party, outer party on the Jesuits.
[03:10:04.199 --> 03:10:06.519]  Doesn't mean that they were at this time actually Jesuits.
[03:10:06.519 --> 03:10:07.519]  I don't believe that they were.
[03:10:07.519 --> 03:10:13.679]  I think that Weishaupt himself did leave the Jesuits and borrow the structure for
[03:10:13.679 --> 03:10:17.539]  his society on how the Jesuits were structured, although I think that eventually later
[03:10:17.539 --> 03:10:22.939]  Jesuits are part of this superstructure because they are eventually allied with the CIA in
[03:10:22.939 --> 03:10:29.140]  the 20th century, as is the papacy after the Cold War.
[03:10:29.140 --> 03:10:32.859]  And so, what we have is this idea that we can structure an inner party and an outer
[03:10:32.859 --> 03:10:39.939]  party and we'll eventually have a happy equality, happy equalitarianism.
[03:10:39.939 --> 03:10:45.820]  There will be a completely natural religion that will be like the noble lie or the state
[03:10:45.820 --> 03:10:51.420]  fostered state-funded and created and controlled religion, and it will be something like a
[03:10:51.420 --> 03:10:57.599]  kind of civic nationalism or a civic global religion that H.G. Wells talked about, who's
[03:10:57.599 --> 03:11:02.380]  a consistent sort of ideological lineage of this conspiracy.
[03:11:02.380 --> 03:11:07.619]  H.G. Wells is a high-level Freemason, and so he knew about the positions and ideas
[03:11:07.619 --> 03:11:13.539]  of Weishaupt that would eventually become basically technocracy.
[03:11:13.539 --> 03:11:16.820]  And that's what H.G. Wells and the whole Royal Society pushed for.
[03:11:16.820 --> 03:11:23.019]  They later combined it not just with egalitarianism, at least for the masses, but with the idea
[03:11:23.019 --> 03:11:29.660]  of the Malthusian idea of depopulation.
[03:11:29.660 --> 03:11:36.179]  Pythagoras is one of the key philosophy figures because Pythagoras was a proto-communitarian,
[03:11:36.179 --> 03:11:37.560]  a proto-communist.
[03:11:37.560 --> 03:11:43.480]  The idea was to overthrow all traditional forms of nation states, people groups, all traditional
[03:11:43.480 --> 03:11:51.820]  forms of religion and statecraft, including the idea of the king or any kind of hierarchy
[03:11:51.820 --> 03:11:56.519]  to create this equalitarian society.
[03:11:56.519 --> 03:12:01.080]  But what's interesting is that in reality, I think the inner group, the inner elite,
[03:12:01.080 --> 03:12:04.400]  the inner party, they always knew that it wasn't really egalitarian.
[03:12:04.400 --> 03:12:10.599]  That's what they tell the people to manipulate the masses because these radical philosophies
[03:12:10.599 --> 03:12:17.119]  always had, for the most part, very powerful, wealthy, influential supporters in the background.
[03:12:17.119 --> 03:12:22.619]  That's because more perceptive and more cunning people understood that philosophies like
[03:12:22.619 --> 03:12:29.580]  radical communism, radical socialism, Marxism could actually be tools for statecraft, tools
[03:12:29.580 --> 03:12:36.779]  for foreign powers, tools for changing the existing regime into something else.
[03:12:36.779 --> 03:12:41.820]  And as we progress in the history of Marxism, many of the classical Marxists continue this
[03:12:41.820 --> 03:12:45.179]  radical worship of flux and change.
[03:12:45.179 --> 03:12:50.820]  You find this in Lenin, you find it in Trotsky, you find it in Mao in their writings.
[03:12:50.820 --> 03:12:56.519]  And what that means is that there's no longer principles that are objective or outside
[03:12:56.519 --> 03:12:59.420]  of man that man submits to.
[03:12:59.420 --> 03:13:02.900]  So there's no principles of hierarchy in nature, right?
[03:13:02.900 --> 03:13:08.980]  Jordan Peterson talks a lot about lobster hierarchies, lobster dominance, the dominance hierarchies.
[03:13:08.980 --> 03:13:11.140]  Well, the dominance hierarchies are actually in nature.
[03:13:11.140 --> 03:13:14.220]  It is a principle of the natural order.
[03:13:14.220 --> 03:13:20.820]  But the consistent revolutionary realizes that all external impositions, including hierarchy
[03:13:20.820 --> 03:13:25.980]  in nature, is an unwanted oppression.
[03:13:25.980 --> 03:13:31.099]  And so by the time of, you know, post Hegel and post Marx, everything turns into an oppressor,
[03:13:31.099 --> 03:13:33.179]  control power dynamic.
[03:13:33.179 --> 03:13:39.099]  And so it's no longer about anybody submitting to or having to recognize external principles
[03:13:39.099 --> 03:13:44.099]  of truth and falsehood, good versus evil, purpose.
[03:13:44.099 --> 03:13:45.619]  And purpose doesn't exist.
[03:13:45.619 --> 03:13:47.019]  Meaning doesn't exist in the world.
[03:13:47.019 --> 03:13:51.740]  It's all a social construct, just like everything else was a social construct.
[03:13:51.740 --> 03:13:53.220]  This is the inevitable result.
[03:13:53.220 --> 03:13:56.060]  It takes a few centuries for this to come about.
[03:13:56.060 --> 03:14:00.740]  But if you go back to the skepticism of David Hume, David Hume was already beginning
[03:14:00.740 --> 03:14:06.179]  to psychologize all of these principles that the ancient and medieval world would
[03:14:06.179 --> 03:14:11.460]  have seen as actual principles operant in the external world.
[03:14:11.460 --> 03:14:16.500]  Essentialism, right, Aristotle's essences, those things existed in the world.
[03:14:16.500 --> 03:14:21.220]  A man's a man, a woman's a woman, authority is authority, right?
[03:14:21.220 --> 03:14:24.820]  Objects have the identity that they have, a tree is a tree, a dog is a dog.
[03:14:24.820 --> 03:14:28.140]  When all of that begins to break down, post enlightenment, post David Hume, post all
[03:14:28.140 --> 03:14:35.779]  these people, eventually what you get is post Darwin and post Nietzsche, a pure will
[03:14:35.779 --> 03:14:43.460]  to power top-down control structure with no intention of submitting to any kind of external
[03:14:43.460 --> 03:14:44.460]  principles.
[03:14:44.460 --> 03:14:46.140]  There are no laws, there are no rules.
[03:14:46.140 --> 03:14:50.340]  Everything is determined by, dictated by the establishment.
[03:14:50.340 --> 03:14:56.019]  That is the operating system that we're under today, the Hegelian idea that the state
[03:14:56.019 --> 03:15:01.460]  is the march of God in history, and the state in the Hegelian system, and this is why it
[03:15:01.460 --> 03:15:06.699]  works so well to blend with Marxism, the state is synthesizing and emerging into a
[03:15:06.699 --> 03:15:12.460]  superstructure that can even destroy itself in multiple revolutions because it's a secret
[03:15:12.460 --> 03:15:17.580]  inter-party state that runs the public states that we know of as the state.
[03:15:17.580 --> 03:15:22.380]  It can destroy itself and revolutionize itself to create the synthesis out of all of these
[03:15:22.380 --> 03:15:29.539]  oppositions, which is ultimately the technocratic one-world state, as all of these people envisioned
[03:15:29.539 --> 03:15:30.859]  centuries ago.
[03:15:30.859 --> 03:15:32.580]  That's where we're going, that is the plan.
[03:15:32.580 --> 03:15:37.420]  There's only one plan, and it's been the same plan, at least back to Weishaupt in
[03:15:37.420 --> 03:15:43.980]  terms of the modern era, openly and buon erode, all of whom wanted a one-world socialist
[03:15:43.980 --> 03:15:47.939]  technocratic, eventually, technocratic government.
[03:15:47.939 --> 03:15:48.939]  This is the Al Jazeera Show.
[03:15:48.939 --> 03:15:51.779]  We're going to look at more examples of this in the modern era when we come back
[03:15:52.179 --> 03:15:53.179]  from the summer break.
[03:15:53.179 --> 03:15:54.179]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:15:54.179 --> 03:15:57.500]  This is the Al Jazeera Show.
[03:15:57.500 --> 03:16:02.420]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our entire
[03:16:02.420 --> 03:16:04.279]  food supply.
[03:16:04.279 --> 03:16:08.900]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element, which
[03:16:08.900 --> 03:16:14.179]  has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population, and there are two things
[03:16:14.179 --> 03:16:15.920]  we need to do about it.
[03:16:15.920 --> 03:16:19.259]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[03:16:19.259 --> 03:16:24.460]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally
[03:16:24.460 --> 03:16:30.420]  keep the soil rich with iodine, and we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount
[03:16:30.420 --> 03:16:36.759]  of iodine every day, derived from ancient sea salts found thousands of feet below the
[03:16:36.759 --> 03:16:38.179]  Earth's surface.
[03:16:38.179 --> 03:16:43.980]  Our Infowars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best.
[03:16:43.980 --> 03:16:51.740]  Pure nascent iodine stabilized in an activated triiodine form for a healthy thyroid and a

[03:17:00.140 --> 03:17:02.699]  It's just non-essential businesses.
[03:17:02.699 --> 03:17:05.099]  It's just non-essential workers.

[03:17:09.179 --> 03:17:11.340]  It's just a restaurant.
[03:17:11.340 --> 03:17:13.259]  It's just nursing homes.
[03:17:13.259 --> 03:17:15.099]  It's just schools.
[03:17:15.099 --> 03:17:18.420]  It's just to keep from overwhelming medical services.
[03:17:18.420 --> 03:17:20.980]  It's just until the cases go down.
[03:17:20.980 --> 03:17:23.259]  It's just to flatten the curve.

[03:17:33.099 --> 03:17:35.580]  It's just churches and mosques.
[03:17:35.580 --> 03:17:37.279]  It's just singing.
[03:17:37.279 --> 03:17:39.939]  It's just travel.
[03:17:39.939 --> 03:17:42.380]  It's just until we get a vaccine.
[03:17:42.420 --> 03:17:44.220]  It's just for the greater good.
[03:17:44.220 --> 03:17:48.140]  It's just fact checking, not censorship.
[03:17:48.140 --> 03:17:50.140]  It's just mandatory.
[03:17:50.140 --> 03:17:52.060]  It isn't just at all.

[03:17:57.340 --> 03:18:02.340]  Omega-3 fatty acids are needed for optimal strength
[03:18:02.500 --> 03:18:05.500]  and they can only be obtained through diet.
[03:18:05.500 --> 03:18:07.779]  They can be found in grass fed beef,
[03:18:07.779 --> 03:18:10.980]  which is why the ruling class is trying to ban it.
[03:18:10.980 --> 03:18:13.060]  And they can be found in fish,
[03:18:13.060 --> 03:18:17.340]  which are arguably the best source of omega-3s.
[03:18:17.340 --> 03:18:19.580]  But the problem today is finding fish
[03:18:19.580 --> 03:18:22.140]  without a high mercury content.

[03:18:36.340 --> 03:18:38.539]  our brain and our heart.
[03:18:38.539 --> 03:18:43.300]  They improve mood, mental clarity, and immune function.

[03:19:26.259 --> 03:19:28.939]  made right here in Central Texas.

[03:19:46.900 --> 03:19:48.060]  what their competitors are.

[03:19:59.740 --> 03:20:04.420]  on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:07.699 --> 03:20:09.019]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:09.019 --> 03:20:10.980]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[03:20:10.980 --> 03:20:13.340]  We were talking about the history of managed dialectics
[03:20:13.340 --> 03:20:18.179]  and revolutionary control of both sides of major conflicts.
[03:20:18.179 --> 03:20:19.779]  And I want to kind of fast forward
[03:20:19.779 --> 03:20:22.060]  to a couple of modern examples.
[03:20:22.060 --> 03:20:24.980]  And if we think about the recent information
[03:20:24.980 --> 03:20:29.220]  that popped up in regard to the supposed neo-Nazi groups
[03:20:29.220 --> 03:20:32.099]  out of nowhere, just all over South America,
[03:20:32.099 --> 03:20:33.300]  and all over the world,
[03:20:33.300 --> 03:20:36.019]  we're talking about the history of managed dialectics
[03:20:36.019 --> 03:20:38.019]  where just all over social media
[03:20:38.019 --> 03:20:41.939]  that it suddenly exists in everyone's purview.
[03:20:43.259 --> 03:20:45.699]  The irony here is that while the establishment
[03:20:45.699 --> 03:20:47.779]  has been telling us for many years
[03:20:47.779 --> 03:20:49.980]  that anyone who questions elections
[03:20:49.980 --> 03:20:52.859]  or who has conservative tendencies at all
[03:20:52.859 --> 03:20:55.179]  is a neo-Nazi, a fascist, right?
[03:20:55.179 --> 03:20:58.740]  If you follow Trump, you're a neo-Nazi, all this nonsense.
[03:20:58.740 --> 03:21:01.779]  Well, the irony is that the very groups
[03:21:01.779 --> 03:21:03.939]  that have been calling us out
[03:21:03.939 --> 03:21:06.660]  as these ridiculous positions,
[03:21:06.660 --> 03:21:08.699]  they're the ones that have been consistently funding
[03:21:08.699 --> 03:21:11.539]  and fostering the real neo-Nazi groups
[03:21:11.539 --> 03:21:12.539]  throughout the Ukraine.
[03:21:12.539 --> 03:21:14.099]  Going back to 2014,
[03:21:14.099 --> 03:21:16.539]  John McCain famously took a trip over there,
[03:21:16.539 --> 03:21:19.060]  appeared on stage with the right sector,
[03:21:19.060 --> 03:21:20.259]  privy sector people.
[03:21:20.259 --> 03:21:23.500]  Those are people connected to Ozol Battalion
[03:21:23.500 --> 03:21:25.460]  and Rachel Blevins of RT.
[03:21:25.460 --> 03:21:28.019]  She recently did a report where she interviewed
[03:21:28.019 --> 03:21:31.220]  one of these characters, Boneface, I guess,
[03:21:31.500 --> 03:21:36.500]  his name's guy, looks like a total prison recruit guy
[03:21:36.820 --> 03:21:40.140]  who claims himself to have been trafficked around
[03:21:40.140 --> 03:21:42.740]  to these conflict zones by the FBI and the CIA,
[03:21:42.740 --> 03:21:43.820]  and that makes perfect sense.
[03:21:43.820 --> 03:21:44.980]  Why is that?
[03:21:44.980 --> 03:21:49.060]  Well, it ties into my dialectical control theory here,
[03:21:49.060 --> 03:21:51.140]  my position here, that we went back
[03:21:51.140 --> 03:21:55.019]  to the French revolutionary figures to look at.
[03:21:55.019 --> 03:21:56.660]  Fast forward to today,
[03:21:56.660 --> 03:21:58.900]  and if you go into the history of the Ukraine,
[03:21:58.900 --> 03:22:00.900]  what we find out is that really the Ukraine
[03:22:00.900 --> 03:22:05.900]  has been about a 75-year proxy for Western intelligence.
[03:22:06.500 --> 03:22:11.380]  This goes back to the World War II intelligence networks
[03:22:11.380 --> 03:22:13.220]  that were set up by Reinhard Galen.
[03:22:13.220 --> 03:22:15.099]  He was probably one of the most famous
[03:22:15.099 --> 03:22:18.060]  World War II intelligence operatives for the Germans,
[03:22:18.060 --> 03:22:20.420]  and he was very adept at creating
[03:22:20.420 --> 03:22:23.619]  and establishing vast spy networks.
[03:22:23.619 --> 03:22:24.619]  He's not the only one.
[03:22:24.619 --> 03:22:25.859]  There were other people involved in this,
[03:22:25.859 --> 03:22:27.619]  people like Otto Skorsany,
[03:22:27.619 --> 03:22:30.539]  members of the SS and so forth,
[03:22:30.539 --> 03:22:31.660]  who made up these networks,
[03:22:31.660 --> 03:22:35.660]  who post-World War II, when the Nazis were defeated,
[03:22:35.660 --> 03:22:40.660]  they reached out to Allen Dulles, Bill Donovan of the OSS,
[03:22:40.900 --> 03:22:42.740]  and James Jesus Angleton and said,
[03:22:42.740 --> 03:22:45.779]  I will hand you all of these networks
[03:22:45.779 --> 03:22:49.220]  to use for Western intelligence
[03:22:49.220 --> 03:22:51.140]  if you allow me to have my freedom.
[03:22:51.140 --> 03:22:55.179]  And so Galen went on to become the head of the BND,
[03:22:55.179 --> 03:22:57.859]  the German intelligence, all the way up until the 1960s.
[03:22:58.740 --> 03:23:02.099]  Nobody seemed to care about this Nazi history and pedigree.
[03:23:02.099 --> 03:23:05.180]  This is part of Paperclip because he made a deal
[03:23:05.180 --> 03:23:09.060]  and he was allowed to have that freedom status
[03:23:09.060 --> 03:23:10.980]  for turning over these networks,
[03:23:10.980 --> 03:23:14.300]  which the CIA then utilized to be part of Gladio
[03:23:14.300 --> 03:23:16.539]  to set up their stay-behind units
[03:23:16.539 --> 03:23:21.500]  in case of a supposed Stalinist Soviet invasion of Europe.
[03:23:21.500 --> 03:23:23.300]  But what happened is that a lot of these groups,
[03:23:23.300 --> 03:23:25.619]  these paramilitary fascist groups
[03:23:25.619 --> 03:23:28.140]  that were part of the P2 Lodge,
[03:23:28.140 --> 03:23:30.539]  the Gladio operation was really masterminded
[03:23:30.539 --> 03:23:34.060]  according to Paul Williams and people like Daniel Ganzer
[03:23:34.060 --> 03:23:36.099]  and his PhD thesis by Kissinger.
[03:23:36.099 --> 03:23:38.380]  So this is really a Kissinger project
[03:23:38.380 --> 03:23:43.380]  to stave off any kind of Soviet invasion of Europe.
[03:23:43.660 --> 03:23:46.340]  But what happened was that this also allowed
[03:23:46.340 --> 03:23:48.259]  for a lot of networks and cells
[03:23:48.259 --> 03:23:50.279]  to be set up all throughout Europe
[03:23:50.279 --> 03:23:54.660]  that were trained in black ops, trained in terror,
[03:23:54.699 --> 03:23:58.099]  trained in bomb making, assassinations, mass shootings.
[03:23:58.099 --> 03:24:00.580]  So this is a fact, this all came out in the 1990s
[03:24:00.580 --> 03:24:04.519]  when Gladio first began to be exposed.
[03:24:04.519 --> 03:24:06.859]  And this is run by NATO.
[03:24:06.859 --> 03:24:08.419]  So in other words, NATO is essentially
[03:24:08.419 --> 03:24:12.460]  a terrorist organization in this regard, regard to Gladio.
[03:24:12.460 --> 03:24:17.460]  And NATO recently declassified or came out
[03:24:17.580 --> 03:24:20.300]  or it was declassified or just published
[03:24:20.300 --> 03:24:23.140]  in the gray zone, did a great report about this in 2021.
[03:24:23.140 --> 03:24:25.439]  I think we did a full breakdown of this
[03:24:25.439 --> 03:24:27.779]  in one of the fourth hours of Alex a couple years ago
[03:24:27.779 --> 03:24:29.060]  when it came out.
[03:24:29.060 --> 03:24:32.060]  But it's NATO's cognitive warfare document.
[03:24:32.060 --> 03:24:35.740]  Now remember, we're supposed to be bad guys in the US
[03:24:35.740 --> 03:24:37.960]  if you support Trump, you're a Nazi.
[03:24:37.960 --> 03:24:41.519]  But the actual establishment really does have
[03:24:41.519 --> 03:24:44.859]  and has utilized Nazi stay-behind networks
[03:24:44.859 --> 03:24:47.580]  and units since World War II, famously.
[03:24:47.580 --> 03:24:52.580]  Public declassified document that Reinhard Galen's networks
[03:24:52.740 --> 03:24:56.859]  were taken over by the CIA in the post-World War II period.
[03:24:56.859 --> 03:25:00.259]  Now those same networks under Galen sent people
[03:25:00.259 --> 03:25:05.259]  to train the Nazi groups that still exist today
[03:25:05.619 --> 03:25:06.519]  in the Ukraine.
[03:25:07.500 --> 03:25:09.820]  Now people, you may have heard of Stepan Bandera.
[03:25:09.820 --> 03:25:12.259]  He's one of the key figures that was running that
[03:25:12.259 --> 03:25:14.300]  for many years in the Ukraine.
[03:25:14.300 --> 03:25:17.820]  There are actual SS and people under Galen
[03:25:17.820 --> 03:25:19.779]  that were sent to train those people.
[03:25:20.720 --> 03:25:23.820]  So those post-World War II networks
[03:25:23.820 --> 03:25:25.840]  have always been there.
[03:25:25.840 --> 03:25:28.439]  And so this shows that the system is not actually
[03:25:28.439 --> 03:25:32.460]  interested in going after neo-Nazis and Nazis.
[03:25:32.460 --> 03:25:34.980]  That's all just for public purview.
[03:25:34.980 --> 03:25:37.539]  They're perfectly happy to fund, use these groups,
[03:25:37.539 --> 03:25:39.900]  even all the way up until John McCain flying over there,
[03:25:39.900 --> 03:25:42.220]  even up until today,
[03:25:42.220 --> 03:25:47.220]  if it's useful to supposedly fight Putin,
[03:25:47.220 --> 03:25:48.259]  who's also Hitler.
[03:25:48.259 --> 03:25:49.400]  So it makes no sense.
[03:25:50.000 --> 03:25:51.320]  To be funding actual neo-Nazi groups
[03:25:51.320 --> 03:25:53.720]  to fight against Hitler, Putin,
[03:25:53.720 --> 03:25:54.840]  literally makes no sense.
[03:25:54.840 --> 03:25:56.880]  That's all propaganda I see.
[03:25:56.880 --> 03:25:58.840]  But this completely destroys the narrative
[03:25:58.840 --> 03:26:00.759]  that the establishment of the system is
[03:26:00.759 --> 03:26:04.919]  genuinely concerned with combating the greatest threat
[03:26:04.919 --> 03:26:07.720]  to America, white supremacists.
[03:26:07.720 --> 03:26:09.240]  Well now wait a minute, then why are you funding
[03:26:09.240 --> 03:26:11.720]  the actual neo-Nazis in the Ukraine?
[03:26:11.720 --> 03:26:13.840]  And the media has made a big fuss about that.
[03:26:13.840 --> 03:26:15.320]  The media was complaining about this.
[03:26:15.320 --> 03:26:17.279]  mainstream media was complaining about neo-Nazis
[03:26:17.320 --> 03:26:19.519]  being supported and aided in the Ukraine
[03:26:19.519 --> 03:26:24.000]  all the way up until the Russian special military
[03:26:24.000 --> 03:26:27.340]  operation, which now it suddenly became an issue.
[03:26:27.340 --> 03:26:30.119]  Now there are no Nazis in Ukraine, you see.
[03:26:30.119 --> 03:26:33.680]  So Zelensky was corrupt, according to mainstream media,
[03:26:33.680 --> 03:26:35.840]  all the way up until the last few years.
[03:26:35.840 --> 03:26:36.939]  Now he's no longer corrupt.
[03:26:36.939 --> 03:26:38.180]  Now we have to support him.
[03:26:38.180 --> 03:26:40.560]  You see the absurdity and the Orwellian
[03:26:40.560 --> 03:26:42.759]  contradictory notions involved in this
[03:26:42.800 --> 03:26:47.320]  Emanuel-Goldstein-style operation all on 1984, right?
[03:26:47.320 --> 03:26:49.320]  The cut-out villains that are out there
[03:26:49.320 --> 03:26:52.279]  that are really just used by the system.
[03:26:52.279 --> 03:26:55.720]  And so this is an example of manipulation of dialectics.
[03:26:55.720 --> 03:26:59.480]  So you're supposedly bad for supporting Trump.
[03:26:59.480 --> 03:27:02.320]  You're a Nazi that supports Trump.
[03:27:02.320 --> 03:27:03.800]  The fascists support Trump,
[03:27:04.900 --> 03:27:06.640]  which is just completely ridiculous.
[03:27:06.640 --> 03:27:10.840]  Meanwhile, the actual establishment since 2014, at least,
[03:27:10.840 --> 03:27:12.240]  and it goes back older than that.
[03:27:12.599 --> 03:27:15.720]  You can go back to the 1980s, the West,
[03:27:15.720 --> 03:27:17.680]  the CIA was funding a lot of these groups as well
[03:27:17.680 --> 03:27:19.840]  back then, and all the way back, as we said,
[03:27:19.840 --> 03:27:22.240]  to the post-World War II era,
[03:27:22.240 --> 03:27:26.720]  when Ukrainian nationalism, at least right after World War I
[03:27:26.720 --> 03:27:31.720]  was erected as this bulwark against Sovietism.
[03:27:31.759 --> 03:27:34.279]  And they utilized these Nazi networks to do that,
[03:27:34.279 --> 03:27:35.980]  which have been there for a long time.
[03:27:35.980 --> 03:27:37.880]  I mean, the Nazi networks post-World War II,
[03:27:37.880 --> 03:27:41.320]  but the anti-Russian sentiment,
[03:27:41.320 --> 03:27:44.840]  at least back to 75 years there.
[03:27:44.840 --> 03:27:47.000]  So this is a geostrategic plan
[03:27:47.000 --> 03:27:49.480]  that plays into large-scale dialectics,
[03:27:49.480 --> 03:27:52.099]  and it just demonstrates that the establishment
[03:27:52.099 --> 03:27:55.919]  really has no desire to actually combat Nazism.
[03:27:55.919 --> 03:27:58.240]  That's just a weapon and a tool that they use
[03:27:58.240 --> 03:28:01.320]  to smear and go after anybody in the United States
[03:28:01.320 --> 03:28:05.439]  who has mildly conservative views, you see.
[03:28:05.439 --> 03:28:07.359]  That's dialectical manipulation,
[03:28:07.359 --> 03:28:10.960]  and that shows that these are not real threats
[03:28:11.480 --> 03:28:12.320]  in America, right?
[03:28:12.320 --> 03:28:15.039]  There are occasional wackos and people oftentimes
[03:28:15.039 --> 03:28:17.240]  that might even be goaded by the feds
[03:28:17.240 --> 03:28:18.960]  to act in this kind of a way.
[03:28:18.960 --> 03:28:21.720]  But if you look up the documentary, The Newberg Sting,
[03:28:21.720 --> 03:28:23.680]  which there was a radical mosque set up,
[03:28:23.680 --> 03:28:25.080]  which was a honey trap.
[03:28:25.080 --> 03:28:28.599]  If you look up the history of Elohim City and McVeigh,
[03:28:28.599 --> 03:28:31.960]  same type of honey trap operation.
[03:28:31.960 --> 03:28:34.240]  And I think that the danger is that,
[03:28:34.240 --> 03:28:35.759]  I think Whitney Webb pointed this out,
[03:28:35.759 --> 03:28:38.720]  these same groups from Ukraine might be utilized
[03:28:38.759 --> 03:28:41.240]  to spark some kind of a fake event,
[03:28:41.240 --> 03:28:44.039]  staged event here in the US,
[03:28:44.039 --> 03:28:47.960]  at least after all of this Twitter furor with Musk.
[03:28:47.960 --> 03:28:50.039]  So the danger is an event
[03:28:50.039 --> 03:28:51.400]  like Alex has been talking about.
[03:28:51.400 --> 03:28:52.720]  This is the Alex Jones show that I'm gonna wear
[03:28:52.720 --> 03:28:54.919]  on my dress, so it's Jay Dyer, Jay's analysis.
[03:28:56.960 --> 03:29:00.400]  We finally have our original best-selling
[03:29:00.400 --> 03:29:02.800]  colloidal silver back in stock.
[03:29:02.800 --> 03:29:04.480]  With the supply chain breakdowns
[03:29:04.480 --> 03:29:06.000]  and all the problems of the economy,
[03:29:06.000 --> 03:29:09.320]  we could not get the highest quality colloidal silver

[03:30:56.759 --> 03:31:01.759]  Omega-3 fatty acids are needed for optimal strength,
[03:31:02.000 --> 03:31:04.980]  and they can only be obtained through diet.
[03:31:04.980 --> 03:31:07.279]  They can be found in grass-fed beef,
[03:31:07.279 --> 03:31:10.460]  which is why the ruling class is trying to ban it.
[03:31:10.460 --> 03:31:12.560]  And they can be found in fish,
[03:31:12.560 --> 03:31:16.840]  which are arguably the best source of omega-3s.
[03:31:16.840 --> 03:31:19.080]  But the problem today is finding fish
[03:31:19.080 --> 03:31:21.640]  without a high mercury content.
[03:31:21.640 --> 03:31:24.640]  Your best option is our Ultimate Fish Oil

[03:33:02.180 --> 03:33:03.779]  it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:03.779 --> 03:33:14.820]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:14.820 --> 03:33:16.419]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[03:33:16.419 --> 03:33:19.099]  We just talked about, in the last segment,
[03:33:19.099 --> 03:33:24.939]  the manipulated control groups like the neo-Nazis in the Ukraine,
[03:33:25.099 --> 03:33:28.060]  which are really assets for the West,
[03:33:28.060 --> 03:33:32.500]  proxy groups to be used to put pressure on Russia,
[03:33:32.500 --> 03:33:36.300]  and the absurdity of sort of calling out anybody
[03:33:36.300 --> 03:33:40.419]  who would question that or would question recent events
[03:33:40.419 --> 03:33:42.619]  as, you know, Trump Nazis
[03:33:42.619 --> 03:33:45.019]  or some sort of ridiculous thing like this.
[03:33:45.019 --> 03:33:50.019]  So, but I wanted to now move to a NATO document
[03:33:50.980 --> 03:33:53.699]  that we mentioned, the cognitive warfare document,
[03:33:53.779 --> 03:33:55.220]  because if you heard Alex yesterday
[03:33:55.220 --> 03:33:58.980]  when he was talking about the Greg Reese report
[03:33:58.980 --> 03:34:03.380]  or the John Bown report on the DARPA lecture
[03:34:03.380 --> 03:34:04.619]  that was given in 2017
[03:34:04.619 --> 03:34:07.380]  about various kinds of nanotech weaponry
[03:34:07.380 --> 03:34:09.099]  that could be rolled out
[03:34:09.099 --> 03:34:11.099]  that might relate to a new pandemic
[03:34:11.099 --> 03:34:12.939]  or something like that,
[03:34:12.939 --> 03:34:17.939]  that lecture is very similar to what was warned about
[03:34:19.099 --> 03:34:22.580]  or, excuse me, what was presaged, I guess you could say,
[03:34:22.580 --> 03:34:26.699]  in the 2020 NATO study, cognitive warfare.
[03:34:26.699 --> 03:34:31.699]  And when the PSYOPs document came out in 2020,
[03:34:31.939 --> 03:34:33.900]  it was actually utilized,
[03:34:33.900 --> 03:34:36.900]  its principles were utilized by the Canadian government
[03:34:36.900 --> 03:34:41.099]  to push a lot of the COVID fear and narrative.
[03:34:41.099 --> 03:34:43.300]  So there's an actual lecture
[03:34:43.300 --> 03:34:45.619]  that a lot of NATO people in Canada,
[03:34:45.619 --> 03:34:48.019]  the Canadian government utilized this document.
[03:34:48.019 --> 03:34:51.279]  They even talk about how they would utilize all this fear.
[03:34:51.320 --> 03:34:54.119]  And that anybody who questioned the establishment
[03:34:54.119 --> 03:34:55.599]  and the narratives that were being put out
[03:34:55.599 --> 03:34:58.640]  would be considered potential enemy combatants.
[03:34:58.640 --> 03:35:00.980]  So in other words, the domestic population
[03:35:00.980 --> 03:35:03.119]  not wanting to go along with vaccines,
[03:35:03.119 --> 03:35:07.160]  not wanting to go along with vaccine passports,
[03:35:07.160 --> 03:35:10.840]  vaccine tracking, total surveillance,
[03:35:10.840 --> 03:35:13.759]  that would be considered in terms of cognitive warfare,
[03:35:13.759 --> 03:35:16.160]  this new version of hybrid warfare,
[03:35:16.160 --> 03:35:18.919]  a potential enemy combatant status
[03:35:18.919 --> 03:35:21.519]  and that you could even be linked
[03:35:21.519 --> 03:35:24.199]  into this database or whatever.
[03:35:24.199 --> 03:35:26.720]  Without knowing it, you would be targeted.
[03:35:26.720 --> 03:35:30.000]  And so it's a very ominous, dystopian
[03:35:30.000 --> 03:35:34.480]  kind of presentation, a document where drones,
[03:35:34.480 --> 03:35:37.680]  autonomous vehicles, and the development of biological
[03:35:37.680 --> 03:35:40.640]  and chemical neuro weapons, as they call it,
[03:35:40.640 --> 03:35:43.480]  would be pursued to not just alter,
[03:35:43.480 --> 03:35:45.419]  as classical psychological operations did,
[03:35:45.419 --> 03:35:47.240]  the ideology of the enemy,
[03:35:47.240 --> 03:35:50.960]  but as this document says, to actually change the biology
[03:35:50.960 --> 03:35:53.519]  and the brain itself of the enemy.
[03:35:53.519 --> 03:35:56.660]  That again, perfectly overlaps with the lecture
[03:35:56.660 --> 03:35:58.619]  from the DARPA guy.
[03:35:58.619 --> 03:36:02.259]  And so this kind of weaponization of neuro research
[03:36:02.259 --> 03:36:04.599]  or neuro ST, as they call it,
[03:36:05.779 --> 03:36:08.640]  could mean then that the opponents
[03:36:08.640 --> 03:36:12.000]  would not just become passive,
[03:36:12.000 --> 03:36:14.320]  but actually might be neutralized,
[03:36:14.320 --> 03:36:17.680]  which sounds, of course, like they can put you to death.
[03:36:17.680 --> 03:36:21.720]  And so it's no longer just changing the opponent's mind,
[03:36:21.720 --> 03:36:25.240]  but exactly what Klaus said, we will change your DNA,
[03:36:25.240 --> 03:36:28.080]  we'll change you, we'll be under your skin,
[03:36:28.080 --> 03:36:29.680]  that's the real goal.
[03:36:29.680 --> 03:36:32.439]  That's exactly what the NATO cognitive warfare document
[03:36:32.439 --> 03:36:33.560]  says.
[03:36:33.560 --> 03:36:35.080]  And so you understand that the development
[03:36:35.080 --> 03:36:39.439]  of controlling both sides of conflicts over the centuries,
[03:36:39.439 --> 03:36:43.080]  the mastering of what we call dialectical philosophy
[03:36:43.080 --> 03:36:45.500]  from Plato to Marx to Hegel
[03:36:47.519 --> 03:36:49.939]  and subsequent philosophers after that,
[03:36:49.939 --> 03:36:54.140]  this really, Darwinism even, you could argue,
[03:36:54.140 --> 03:36:57.119]  this really allows the establishment
[03:36:57.119 --> 03:37:00.160]  to have this position beyond what most people
[03:37:00.160 --> 03:37:02.680]  are involved in, in terms of conflicts.
[03:37:02.680 --> 03:37:04.640]  You can think of it like a circle.
[03:37:04.640 --> 03:37:08.820]  And within that circle is the accepted Overton window
[03:37:08.820 --> 03:37:11.519]  of what you can and can't talk about
[03:37:11.519 --> 03:37:15.199]  and what types of things are allowed in public discourse,
[03:37:15.199 --> 03:37:17.759]  even in terms of the questions that are asked.
[03:37:17.759 --> 03:37:20.199]  So for example, you wouldn't be allowed to,
[03:37:20.199 --> 03:37:21.720]  it's not even considered within the purview
[03:37:21.720 --> 03:37:25.039]  of the possibility to ask a question like,
[03:37:25.039 --> 03:37:27.000]  well, could the wars of the 20th century
[03:37:27.000 --> 03:37:28.800]  have been intentionally fostered
[03:37:28.800 --> 03:37:31.880]  by an elite or a superstructure?
[03:37:31.880 --> 03:37:33.439]  That's not an allowed question,
[03:37:33.439 --> 03:37:35.320]  it's not within the domains, the parameters,
[03:37:35.320 --> 03:37:38.519]  the magic circle of what can and can't be discussed.
[03:37:38.519 --> 03:37:40.919]  And so a big part of perception management,
[03:37:40.960 --> 03:37:42.480]  that Kissinger talks about,
[03:37:44.199 --> 03:37:46.800]  has nothing to do ultimately with what's true or false.
[03:37:46.800 --> 03:37:49.160]  All that matters is managing the public's perception
[03:37:49.160 --> 03:37:51.599]  of what things are possible and not possible,
[03:37:51.599 --> 03:37:54.759]  what questions can and cannot even be asked.
[03:37:54.759 --> 03:37:56.320]  This is also famously covered
[03:37:56.320 --> 03:37:59.820]  by the well-known philosopher, Eric Voglen,
[03:37:59.820 --> 03:38:02.320]  who talked about how technocracies operate
[03:38:02.320 --> 03:38:04.880]  in a neo-gnostic way.
[03:38:04.880 --> 03:38:07.180]  There's a sort of inherent neo-gnostic principle
[03:38:07.180 --> 03:38:09.119]  that it sets the parameters
[03:38:09.160 --> 03:38:11.140]  of what questions can and can't be asked.
[03:38:11.140 --> 03:38:14.340]  So you're not even allowed to ask a question like,
[03:38:14.340 --> 03:38:17.199]  has there been a revolutionary plan
[03:38:17.199 --> 03:38:18.359]  for the last several centuries
[03:38:18.359 --> 03:38:21.880]  going back to Billington's Fire in the Minds of Men,
[03:38:21.880 --> 03:38:24.279]  theorizing and analysis that you would get
[03:38:24.279 --> 03:38:27.599]  French revolutionary, communist socialists,
[03:38:27.599 --> 03:38:29.859]  proto-technocrats even back then?
[03:38:29.859 --> 03:38:32.960]  That's not a question, it's a nonsense question.
[03:38:32.960 --> 03:38:34.840]  You're not allowed to ask that.
[03:38:34.840 --> 03:38:36.000]  And that's why the media,
[03:38:36.000 --> 03:38:38.680]  mass media has been there for so long to control
[03:38:39.119 --> 03:38:40.599]  and set the parameters for the questions
[03:38:40.599 --> 03:38:41.759]  that are allowed to be asked
[03:38:41.759 --> 03:38:43.160]  and that are not allowed to be asked.
[03:38:43.160 --> 03:38:44.820]  Nowadays, media is basically there, I think,
[03:38:44.820 --> 03:38:48.279]  to just sort of confuse the public.
[03:38:48.279 --> 03:38:52.640]  And so you get this overwhelming, this avalanche of data
[03:38:52.640 --> 03:38:56.199]  that's all conflicting and contradictory and confusing.
[03:38:56.199 --> 03:38:58.240]  And that's intentional, right?
[03:38:58.240 --> 03:39:00.439]  The public doesn't have an education
[03:39:00.439 --> 03:39:03.880]  in how to know these things and patterns in history.
[03:39:03.880 --> 03:39:05.439]  There are no patterns to history.
[03:39:05.439 --> 03:39:06.779]  History doesn't exist, right?
[03:39:06.779 --> 03:39:09.980]  Remember 1984, there is no such thing as history.
[03:39:09.980 --> 03:39:13.619]  It's whatever the party writes at that moment.
[03:39:13.619 --> 03:39:16.500]  And that's all part of that new revolutionary dialectic.
[03:39:16.500 --> 03:39:21.500]  Basically, all of modernity is premised on liberalism.
[03:39:22.140 --> 03:39:26.779]  And by liberalism, I don't mean GOP, RINO, that stuff.
[03:39:26.779 --> 03:39:29.699]  I don't mean Democrats.
[03:39:29.699 --> 03:39:33.840]  I mean post-enlightenment removal
[03:39:33.840 --> 03:39:36.840]  of the notion of all forms of hierarchy in nature,
[03:39:36.840 --> 03:39:39.919]  all forms of meaning and principles in the external world.
[03:39:39.919 --> 03:39:43.720]  Those don't exist anymore, according to the establishment.
[03:39:43.720 --> 03:39:45.660]  And Hegel, I think, is a key figure
[03:39:45.660 --> 03:39:48.359]  because Hegel really said that the state is God's
[03:39:48.359 --> 03:39:51.359]  and the state will tell you what's meaningful.
[03:39:51.359 --> 03:39:52.680]  That's why it was a very big deal
[03:39:52.680 --> 03:39:54.680]  when there was starting to be pushback,
[03:39:54.680 --> 03:39:56.199]  what, a year ago or so,
[03:39:56.199 --> 03:40:00.840]  on the notion of whether or not the infants, right,
[03:40:00.840 --> 03:40:03.759]  have the principle of being made in the image of God
[03:40:04.640 --> 03:40:05.840]  to have life from the womb,
[03:40:05.840 --> 03:40:09.880]  or is the right to life something dictated by the state?
[03:40:10.820 --> 03:40:13.880]  In the Hegelian sense, in the technocrat sense,
[03:40:13.880 --> 03:40:16.759]  the state dictates when you're alive.
[03:40:16.759 --> 03:40:21.160]  And so perhaps you're not alive or conscious until age three.
[03:40:21.160 --> 03:40:22.560]  Maybe you're a potential person,
[03:40:22.560 --> 03:40:24.199]  but you're not a human person until age three.
[03:40:24.199 --> 03:40:27.759]  Well, then you could be conceivably aborted up to age three.
[03:40:27.759 --> 03:40:29.519]  And there are some radical people out there
[03:40:29.519 --> 03:40:30.759]  who push for that.
[03:40:30.759 --> 03:40:32.460]  I think Peter Singer pushes for that,
[03:40:32.460 --> 03:40:34.259]  as well as a bunch of other nasty things,
[03:40:34.259 --> 03:40:37.340]  supposedly ethical philosophers, right?
[03:40:37.340 --> 03:40:39.939]  And so the establishment has a vested interest,
[03:40:39.939 --> 03:40:44.220]  obviously, in the state, the super state,
[03:40:44.220 --> 03:40:46.699]  the corporate state, the technocratic state,
[03:40:46.699 --> 03:40:49.340]  dictating meaning, dictating what's true,
[03:40:49.340 --> 03:40:52.199]  dictating gender, dictating all of these things
[03:40:52.199 --> 03:40:55.740]  as not real, as whatever you want it to be.
[03:40:55.740 --> 03:40:59.199]  And so there's a cloak of freedom and liberty
[03:41:00.080 --> 03:41:03.960]  that's actually a tool for social control.
[03:41:03.960 --> 03:41:06.060]  Telling you, telling children, telling people
[03:41:06.060 --> 03:41:09.720]  that you can be and identify as whatever you want to
[03:41:09.720 --> 03:41:12.759]  is a method of destruction and control
[03:41:12.759 --> 03:41:14.060]  that is intentional.
[03:41:14.060 --> 03:41:15.240]  It is a weapon.
[03:41:15.240 --> 03:41:17.000]  Tavistock developed it.
[03:41:17.000 --> 03:41:20.880]  It's not good-hearted liberals that wanna do right
[03:41:20.880 --> 03:41:22.380]  and wanna help people.
[03:41:22.380 --> 03:41:23.919]  Maybe at the lower levels,
[03:41:23.919 --> 03:41:25.880]  there's people who, the normies out there,
[03:41:25.880 --> 03:41:28.039]  maybe they operate that way.
[03:41:28.039 --> 03:41:30.000]  But at the higher levels,
[03:41:30.000 --> 03:41:34.779]  this is fourth, fifth, sixth generation hybrid warfare.
[03:41:34.779 --> 03:41:38.800]  It's intentional destruction of what came before.
[03:41:38.800 --> 03:41:40.240]  And more and more people are picking up on this
[03:41:40.240 --> 03:41:43.759]  that the plan was to actually destroy
[03:41:43.759 --> 03:41:46.080]  the existing systems, destroy from within
[03:41:46.080 --> 03:41:47.919]  the existing medical system,
[03:41:47.919 --> 03:41:50.779]  the existing political systems, the nation state,
[03:41:50.779 --> 03:41:52.779]  destroy even the education system,
[03:41:52.779 --> 03:41:55.820]  let all of these collapse and crumble from within,
[03:41:55.820 --> 03:41:57.259]  the same way that like Cloward and Piven
[03:41:57.340 --> 03:42:00.580]  is intended to put stressors on the economic system
[03:42:00.580 --> 03:42:05.580]  to break it down to accelerate the next phase, right?
[03:42:06.140 --> 03:42:07.900]  That's dialectical thinking.
[03:42:07.900 --> 03:42:10.199]  You can intentionally cause chaos and destruction
[03:42:10.199 --> 03:42:13.259]  because chaos and destruction furthers the dialectic.
[03:42:13.259 --> 03:42:16.619]  The process furthers the process.
[03:42:16.619 --> 03:42:20.779]  Process philosophy, Hegel, Whitehead, right?
[03:42:20.779 --> 03:42:25.779]  These are almost revolutionary faiths.
[03:42:25.939 --> 03:42:28.460]  In other words, the faith, as he calls it,
[03:42:28.460 --> 03:42:29.500]  notice at the bottom of the book,
[03:42:29.500 --> 03:42:31.180]  it's the revolutionary faith.
[03:42:34.140 --> 03:42:35.820]  Because there's a religious commitment
[03:42:35.820 --> 03:42:37.859]  to creative destruction.
[03:42:39.199 --> 03:42:43.140]  And so that can be weaponized, that can be utilized.
[03:42:44.119 --> 03:42:48.060]  And military strategists, people who study civilization,
[03:42:48.060 --> 03:42:50.180]  civilization studies, they are aware of this
[03:42:50.180 --> 03:42:52.259]  and they know it can be weaponized.
[03:42:52.259 --> 03:42:53.419]  This is the Alex Jones, I'm trying to guess,
[03:42:53.460 --> 03:42:56.460]  this is Jay Dyer, Jay's analysis.
[03:42:56.460 --> 03:42:58.180]  I didn't realize this was back this week.
[03:42:58.180 --> 03:42:59.019]  Thought it was next week.
[03:42:59.019 --> 03:43:00.820]  I come in this morning, it's back in the warehouse,
[03:43:00.820 --> 03:43:01.699]  ready to roll.
[03:43:03.199 --> 03:43:05.419]  Body's ultimate ternary formula.
[03:43:05.419 --> 03:43:08.419]  And the first thing I did was pop one of these bad boys.
[03:43:09.259 --> 03:43:11.180]  Overhead shot, please.
[03:43:11.180 --> 03:43:14.160]  Look how full this bottle is.
[03:43:15.279 --> 03:43:16.939]  Right to the top, folks.
[03:43:18.240 --> 03:43:23.240]  Right to the top with these 95% curcumin on it.
[03:43:24.060 --> 03:43:28.300]  Again, most turmeric formulas are 5%, some are maybe 10.
[03:43:28.300 --> 03:43:30.980]  The other strongest brands are 75%.
[03:43:30.980 --> 03:43:34.740]  This is 95%.
[03:43:34.740 --> 03:43:36.820]  Super constant, so like taking one pill
[03:43:36.820 --> 03:43:39.740]  is like taking 10 of the average pill.
[03:43:39.740 --> 03:43:41.220]  It's that powerful.
[03:43:41.220 --> 03:43:42.359]  Or more.
[03:43:42.359 --> 03:43:44.800]  So they're available at infoawarsetour.com.
[03:43:45.900 --> 03:43:48.539]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula,
[03:43:48.539 --> 03:43:51.019]  pulled out for almost eight months back in stock
[03:43:51.019 --> 03:43:53.380]  at infoawarsetour.com.
[03:43:53.380 --> 03:43:56.279]  Or triple eight, two five three three one three nine.
[03:43:57.500 --> 03:43:59.619]  I talk a lot about the great successes
[03:43:59.619 --> 03:44:00.980]  Info Wars has had.
[03:44:00.980 --> 03:44:02.900]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[03:44:02.900 --> 03:44:06.900]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[03:44:06.900 --> 03:44:08.619]  But when we talk about the crew at Info Wars,
[03:44:08.619 --> 03:44:11.419]  people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[03:44:12.259 --> 03:44:15.820]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[03:44:15.820 --> 03:44:17.900]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer
[03:44:17.900 --> 03:44:20.340]  and the hard work they engage in every day,
[03:44:20.340 --> 03:44:22.660]  five, six, seven days a week,
[03:44:22.660 --> 03:44:24.619]  it's really just incredible.
[03:44:24.619 --> 03:44:26.300]  So for myself, the whole Info Wars crew,
[03:44:26.300 --> 03:44:28.259]  I thank you for your past support.
[03:44:28.259 --> 03:44:29.919]  And I want to encourage you now to realize
[03:44:29.919 --> 03:44:34.060]  that Info Wars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[03:44:34.060 --> 03:44:35.939]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us,
[03:44:35.939 --> 03:44:37.080]  and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[03:44:37.080 --> 03:44:39.019]  But most viewers and listeners
[03:44:39.019 --> 03:44:41.220]  never go to infoawarsetour.com
[03:44:41.220 --> 03:44:42.539]  and you never buy great products
[03:44:42.539 --> 03:44:44.140]  that enrich and empower your life.
[03:44:44.140 --> 03:44:46.019]  All at the same time, give us on air.
[03:44:46.019 --> 03:44:47.880]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners
[03:44:47.880 --> 03:44:50.300]  actually go buy products at infoawarsetour.com.
[03:44:50.300 --> 03:44:52.380]  If just 1% more of you took action
[03:44:52.380 --> 03:44:53.859]  and went to infoawarsetour.com,
[03:44:53.859 --> 03:44:55.259]  our funding problems will be over.
[03:44:55.259 --> 03:44:56.220]  Please take action now.
[03:44:56.220 --> 03:44:57.640]  Bodies is back.

[03:44:59.820 --> 03:45:01.980]  has returned to infoawarsetour.com

[03:45:06.980 --> 03:45:10.400]  turmeric is one of the most studied medicinal herbs today.
[03:45:10.400 --> 03:45:12.740]  Hundreds of peer-reviewed scientific articles
[03:45:12.740 --> 03:45:14.859]  are published every year on the chemistry
[03:45:14.859 --> 03:45:16.740]  and therapeutic potential of turmeric
[03:45:16.740 --> 03:45:18.340]  and its active components.
[03:45:18.340 --> 03:45:21.220]  Bodies will reduce inflammation throughout the body,
[03:45:21.220 --> 03:45:24.820]  help boost and support flexibility, increase mobility,
[03:45:24.820 --> 03:45:27.900]  assist in joint function, bolster your immune system,
[03:45:27.900 --> 03:45:29.259]  and so much more.
[03:45:29.259 --> 03:45:31.019]  Regular turmeric from the store
[03:45:31.019 --> 03:45:34.640]  contains about 1-5% of the active ingredient curcuminoids,
[03:45:34.640 --> 03:45:37.419]  but our super powerful extract using bodies
[03:45:37.419 --> 03:45:41.259]  contains over 95% of the active ingredients in turmeric.

[03:45:44.779 --> 03:45:46.859]  so if you wanna put the true power of turmeric
[03:45:46.859 --> 03:45:48.660]  to the test, then look no further.

[03:46:08.619 --> 03:46:10.779]  a massive dose of bee pollen,
[03:46:10.779 --> 03:46:13.980]  a gigantic dose of highest quality turmeric,
[03:46:13.980 --> 03:46:16.060]  and then it just gets crazier from there.
[03:46:16.060 --> 03:46:17.340]  It's about to sell out.
[03:46:17.340 --> 03:46:18.820]  We haven't had it in stock for years.

[03:46:55.300 --> 03:47:04.580]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:04.580 --> 03:47:14.140]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:14.140 --> 03:47:19.340]  We're talking about the big picture plan of what the elite for at least a few centuries
[03:47:19.340 --> 03:47:22.539]  in the modern era have as their goal.
[03:47:22.539 --> 03:47:31.660]  And that is ultimately what was published by World Economic Forum luminary, Noah Yuval Harari
[03:47:31.660 --> 03:47:34.519]  in his book, Homo Deus.
[03:47:34.519 --> 03:47:39.259]  So for many, many years, of course, we've been talking about this and we've been explaining
[03:47:39.259 --> 03:47:40.779]  that this is the ultimate plan.
[03:47:40.779 --> 03:47:45.939]  Alex has talked about it right all the way back to Ray Kurzweil and Endgame.
[03:47:45.939 --> 03:47:51.560]  And even before that, the idea was that technology would allow man to evolve into
[03:47:51.560 --> 03:47:53.840]  being his own god.
[03:47:53.840 --> 03:47:59.439]  And there are older books that kind of presage this as well that were way ahead of their
[03:47:59.439 --> 03:48:00.439]  time.
[03:48:00.439 --> 03:48:05.320]  I remember some years ago I read AC Wells's Island of Dr. Moreau, which I'll be covering
[03:48:05.320 --> 03:48:07.160]  on my channel in the near future.
[03:48:07.160 --> 03:48:08.640]  We haven't looked at that many, many years.
[03:48:08.640 --> 03:48:13.560]  And one of the theories that was way ahead of his time in that book was the plasticity
[03:48:13.560 --> 03:48:15.480]  of human nature.
[03:48:15.480 --> 03:48:22.800]  Now there can be malleable plasticity elements to human nature, which are there, but we shouldn't
[03:48:22.800 --> 03:48:27.960]  conclude from that, that therefore it's all plastic, we're all just Gumby people.
[03:48:27.960 --> 03:48:34.439]  And there's no actual metaphysical meaning or that there's no chromosome, none of that.
[03:48:34.439 --> 03:48:36.199]  We're not just Gumby people.
[03:48:36.199 --> 03:48:37.779]  We have identity over time.
[03:48:37.779 --> 03:48:40.960]  There is such a thing as human nature, it does exist.
[03:48:40.960 --> 03:48:44.400]  But the premise of Island of Dr. Moreau, if you don't know, is that there's this
[03:48:44.400 --> 03:48:50.679]  sort of mad science doctor who's got a God complex on an island and he's experimenting
[03:48:50.679 --> 03:48:59.199]  and creating genetic hybrids and he's creating these sort of monstrosities.
[03:48:59.199 --> 03:49:02.380]  And so somebody stuck on this island, they're trying to get off of it because it's kind
[03:49:02.380 --> 03:49:06.300]  of a microcosm of the world.
[03:49:06.300 --> 03:49:11.679]  You could say the island represents sort of the future dystopian world.
[03:49:11.679 --> 03:49:17.279]  You could develop as a result of DNA splicing and all that in the mind of H.G. Wells.
[03:49:17.279 --> 03:49:19.320]  I think he wrote that in 1896.
[03:49:19.320 --> 03:49:25.439]  So he was way ahead of his time in that regard as an insider of what the future plans
[03:49:25.439 --> 03:49:26.439]  were.
[03:49:26.439 --> 03:49:31.519]  Now, if we fast forward to today, Harari's book, and by the way, he's a historian,
[03:49:31.519 --> 03:49:37.199]  so he's not a scientist, the establishment's always interested in, do you have the credentials
[03:49:37.199 --> 03:49:39.800]  or he's not actually a scientist, so he's a historian.
[03:49:39.800 --> 03:49:46.800]  But this book was published in 2016 and the idea from the very beginning of the book
[03:49:46.800 --> 03:49:53.439]  is that there's not a meaning external to man.
[03:49:53.439 --> 03:49:56.060]  Man creates all of his own meaning.
[03:49:56.060 --> 03:50:00.740]  He doesn't discover meaning, he doesn't discover principles, he creates these things.
[03:50:00.740 --> 03:50:06.880]  So the second chapter, for example, is that, excuse me, the second section is that
[03:50:06.880 --> 03:50:09.599]  man gives meaning to the world.
[03:50:09.599 --> 03:50:11.480]  So we create our own meaning.
[03:50:11.480 --> 03:50:17.400]  Meaning is not something that we discover, we create our own meaning.
[03:50:17.400 --> 03:50:22.720]  And if we can create our own meaning, then we can create our own godhood eventually.
[03:50:22.720 --> 03:50:27.359]  That's the point of where the book goes is that we are evolving beyond old stories
[03:50:27.359 --> 03:50:30.800]  of religion to a new humanity.
[03:50:30.800 --> 03:50:33.000]  He calls it a new human.
[03:50:33.000 --> 03:50:34.000]  What's the new human?
[03:50:34.000 --> 03:50:40.000]  The new human is the coming, no longer interested in religion human, but the religion
[03:50:40.000 --> 03:50:44.960]  of AI or what he calls data-ism, so the religion of the future, the religion that's
[03:50:44.960 --> 03:50:51.279]  an emerging deus ex machina right now is data-ism, and the future will all be
[03:50:51.279 --> 03:50:54.439]  about pure raw data.
[03:50:54.439 --> 03:50:56.720]  That will be the new meaning.
[03:50:56.720 --> 03:51:02.599]  And again, meaning is not something that's a principle in the world.
[03:51:02.599 --> 03:51:04.679]  This is not something in the world.
[03:51:04.679 --> 03:51:06.740]  Things don't have purpose, they don't have meaning.
[03:51:06.740 --> 03:51:08.199]  Everything is evolving, you see.
[03:51:08.199 --> 03:51:13.119]  So he's within this tradition of the same revolutionary philosophers that we were talking
[03:51:13.119 --> 03:51:17.400]  about, that everything is in evolutionary flux.
[03:51:17.400 --> 03:51:21.539]  Since everything's in flux, there's no stability, there's no fixity.
[03:51:21.539 --> 03:51:25.220]  It's either or, you either believe in everything being in stasis or everything's in flux
[03:51:25.220 --> 03:51:26.220]  and change.
[03:51:26.220 --> 03:51:29.880]  Well, if everything is flux and change, then the principle that everything is flux
[03:51:29.880 --> 03:51:32.640]  and change would also be subject to change.
[03:51:32.640 --> 03:51:33.640]  That's self-refuting.
[03:51:33.640 --> 03:51:37.519]  So obviously it's not true that everything is flux and change.
[03:51:37.519 --> 03:51:40.480]  That's a self-refuting statement.
[03:51:40.480 --> 03:51:45.039]  There's both fixity and change in the world, there's stasis and change.
[03:51:45.039 --> 03:51:47.359]  Both of those things are true.
[03:51:47.359 --> 03:51:51.080]  Objects have identity over time, and they change.
[03:51:51.080 --> 03:51:56.240]  It can be a both-and, not an either-or, and a lot of bad philosophical mistakes are
[03:51:56.240 --> 03:52:03.199]  premised on false either-ors, but also so is dialectical manipulation.
[03:52:03.199 --> 03:52:05.420]  It's premised on false either-ors.
[03:52:05.420 --> 03:52:07.439]  You're either with us or you're with the terrorists.
[03:52:07.439 --> 03:52:09.400]  Well, wait a minute.
[03:52:09.400 --> 03:52:12.599]  What about a third option where both of you are wrong?
[03:52:12.599 --> 03:52:16.199]  What if I don't like neoconservatism or terrorism?
[03:52:16.199 --> 03:52:18.640]  No, I have to choose either or.
[03:52:18.640 --> 03:52:19.640]  It's a false either-or.
[03:52:19.640 --> 03:52:25.779]  It's a very low-level manipulation, and that's a fallacy in logic, but you'll notice a lot
[03:52:25.820 --> 03:52:31.060]  of propaganda, a lot of government pronouncements, and old-school Bush speeches.
[03:52:31.060 --> 03:52:36.779]  They operate on basic fallacies, but the fallacies are very useful in propaganda,
[03:52:36.779 --> 03:52:37.779]  you see.
[03:52:37.779 --> 03:52:43.300]  For example, appeals to emotion are used all the time in propaganda.
[03:52:43.300 --> 03:52:48.740]  Do you support the death of children?
[03:52:48.740 --> 03:52:54.720]  So if you don't like the Iraq War, it's because you like Saddam throwing babies out
[03:52:54.759 --> 03:52:55.759]  of incubators.
[03:52:55.759 --> 03:53:00.420]  You see how low IQ and silly this is, but it works, right?
[03:53:00.420 --> 03:53:06.439]  That's very useful because most of the public doesn't operate in a critical thinking way.
[03:53:06.439 --> 03:53:10.800]  They operate, unfortunately, on an emotional basis, and so there's an emotional reaction
[03:53:10.800 --> 03:53:15.519]  to these propaganda, which most of the time they're fake news stories, right, especially
[03:53:15.519 --> 03:53:19.720]  things that are intended to provoke war, right?
[03:53:19.720 --> 03:53:26.039]  So the barbarian, for example, Tavistock got really sophisticated with this.
[03:53:26.039 --> 03:53:32.199]  Before it was Tavistock, it was called Wellington House, and the Bryce Report wrote up all
[03:53:32.199 --> 03:53:43.199]  these stories about how the leader of Germany, the Kaiser, the Kaiser was the butcher,
[03:53:43.199 --> 03:53:45.840]  and they just called him the butcher, the beast and butcher.
[03:53:45.960 --> 03:53:51.000]  I think they even called him the butcher of Baghdad or something akin to that, the butcher
[03:53:51.000 --> 03:53:55.400]  of whatever, the butcher of Germany, and then they used that butcher of Baghdad for Saddam's
[03:53:55.400 --> 03:54:00.320]  exact same propaganda they used for the Kaiser, and it doesn't even matter if the
[03:54:00.320 --> 03:54:01.320]  stories are true.
[03:54:01.320 --> 03:54:04.320]  It's just in the media that, oh, he's the butcher of, yeah, we got to take down that
[03:54:04.320 --> 03:54:09.160]  Saddam because he's the butcher, but Saddam was trained by the CIA and put in this
[03:54:09.160 --> 03:54:14.800]  by the CIA, famously well-known, so the same people who can be established, set up by the
[03:54:14.800 --> 03:54:20.359]  system, by the West, can then be dispensed with and thrown away when they're no longer
[03:54:20.359 --> 03:54:21.359]  needed.
[03:54:21.359 --> 03:54:26.900]  And that's the unfortunate nature of dialectical manipulation in big geopolitics, but it's
[03:54:26.900 --> 03:54:28.359]  all playing out right now.
[03:54:28.359 --> 03:54:36.000]  We just see this with these fake neo-Nazi groups, and that ultimately ties into the
[03:54:36.000 --> 03:54:43.000]  long-term picture, I would argue, because the people who are pushing Malthusianism,
[03:54:43.000 --> 03:54:48.880]  all the Great Reset crowd, the Davos crowd, Jane Goodall, all those types, Harari.
[03:54:48.880 --> 03:54:54.320]  All of those people pushing Great Reset are the same ones that have a face, a veneer
[03:54:54.320 --> 03:55:02.439]  of democracy, liberalism, concern, oh, we care about the environment, we care about
[03:55:02.439 --> 03:55:03.439]  immigrants.
[03:55:03.439 --> 03:55:04.759]  No, they don't.
[03:55:04.759 --> 03:55:12.279]  It's the same people who want the population scaled down 90%.
[03:55:12.279 --> 03:55:13.679]  There's not an actual concern.
[03:55:13.679 --> 03:55:16.160]  That's all for PR.
[03:55:16.160 --> 03:55:21.560]  That's a cloak, and Alex has talked about the liberal cloak all the way back to what
[03:55:21.560 --> 03:55:23.800]  Obama deception, right?
[03:55:23.800 --> 03:55:28.800]  And yet it still fools all these people to think that the left cares about humanity.
[03:55:28.800 --> 03:55:35.980]  No, the left is a Malthusian cult, a death cult, in its inner core, and it controls
[03:55:35.980 --> 03:55:42.900]  a giant golem zombie mind control being, this entity of all these people that are
[03:55:42.900 --> 03:55:48.539]  in this bored hive that believe that, well, they're just basically completely controlled
[03:55:48.539 --> 03:55:49.539]  androids, right?
[03:55:49.539 --> 03:55:55.580]  I put up a video that humans are becoming robots, and I don't just mean androids in
[03:55:55.580 --> 03:55:58.859]  the sense of technology and brain implants.
[03:55:58.859 --> 03:56:04.340]  Yeah, that's true, but people are already androids in the sense of being completely
[03:56:04.340 --> 03:56:08.820]  controlled by false narratives and completely worshipping the system.
[03:56:08.820 --> 03:56:14.500]  They're already in a cult, and so they're all the more going to be susceptible to accepting
[03:56:14.500 --> 03:56:19.340]  whatever comes down the pipe when we're told, as the NATO SIAB document says, there
[03:56:19.340 --> 03:56:23.580]  will be pushed implants and chips.
[03:56:23.580 --> 03:56:30.019]  There will be nanotech-type injections and so forth that will be pushed.
[03:56:30.019 --> 03:56:34.099]  The UK Ministry of Defense document that came out a few years ago, the document
[03:56:34.099 --> 03:56:39.859]  about transhumanism, it said that we will have to change global ethics through social
[03:56:39.859 --> 03:56:47.900]  engineering so that people no longer object to having nanotechnology and implementation
[03:56:47.900 --> 03:56:50.539]  of various forms of microchipping.
[03:56:50.539 --> 03:56:54.660]  It's not microchips in the classical sense anymore, it's more like nanotech, so that
[03:56:54.660 --> 03:56:56.380]  people accept that.
[03:56:56.380 --> 03:56:59.340]  So you have all of these white paper documents that are coming out.
[03:56:59.340 --> 03:57:00.340]  They're all public.
[03:57:00.340 --> 03:57:05.660]  They declassify or they get released, and yeah, the NATO cognitive warfare document is
[03:57:05.660 --> 03:57:06.660]  a perfect example.
[03:57:06.660 --> 03:57:10.660]  It says the exact same thing as the UK Ministry of Defense transhumanist document.
[03:57:10.660 --> 03:57:12.220]  They say the exact same thing.
[03:57:12.220 --> 03:57:19.340]  We're going to have to not just change your mind, but change your genetics, and
[03:57:19.340 --> 03:57:23.060]  there we have Financial Times putting out an article saying, yes, of course the public
[03:57:23.060 --> 03:57:25.259]  is the target of psyops.
[03:57:25.259 --> 03:57:28.740]  Thank you for finally admitting what we were saying for so long, and by the way, if
[03:57:28.740 --> 03:57:33.060]  you don't like psyops, you're a bigot.
[03:57:33.060 --> 03:57:36.259]  It doesn't exist, but when it does exist, it's a great thing, and if you don't
[03:57:36.259 --> 03:57:37.259]  like it, you're a bigot.

[03:58:46.099 --> 03:58:50.340]  The globalists aren't just targeting us through the poison shots or the electromagnetic
[03:58:50.340 --> 03:58:52.539]  5G or the GMO crops.
[03:58:52.539 --> 03:58:57.380]  They're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals that the EPA has authorized companies and
[03:58:57.380 --> 03:58:58.939]  industry to use.
[03:58:58.939 --> 03:59:02.259]  One of the top pesticides used is Atrazine.
[03:59:02.259 --> 03:59:05.920]  The allowable level the government admits that they allow to be in your water supply
[03:59:05.920 --> 03:59:11.500]  is enough to sterilize you and basically turn your son into a feminized mutant.
[03:59:11.500 --> 03:59:12.660]  Look it up.
[03:59:12.660 --> 03:59:13.880]  Don't let them do this to your family.
