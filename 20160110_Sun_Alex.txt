[00:00.000 --> 00:12.440]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:12.440 --> 00:15.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[00:15.800 --> 00:26.680]  It is Sunday, my friends, the 10th day of January, 2016 as we accelerate into the future.
[00:26.680 --> 00:35.400]  I'm your host, Alex Jones. We have a huge jam-packed Sunday live transmission today.
[00:35.400 --> 00:41.160]  It is incredible, the sex attacks by the radical Muslims in Germany, blowing wide open, exposing
[00:41.160 --> 00:42.360]  government cover-ups.
[00:42.360 --> 00:49.160]  Catalan, one of the most beautiful areas of Spain, succeeding in a peaceful way.
[00:49.160 --> 00:54.460]  We've got that coming up. We've got Donald Trump in major polls nationwide, turbocharging
[00:54.460 --> 01:02.360]  with big leads on Hillary Clinton. It's Trump's to win, Trump's to lose right now.
[01:02.360 --> 01:09.440]  We've got huge news on the situation with the unraveling economy and more today.
[01:09.440 --> 01:15.320]  And the big move to go for the impeachment of Obama for his lawlessness, here's the report.
[01:15.320 --> 01:20.920]  Regarding executive orders, the Constitution states in Article II, Section 3, Clause 5,
[01:20.920 --> 01:27.000]  that the executive, i.e., the president, take care that the laws be faithfully executed
[01:27.000 --> 01:32.960]  or face impeachment. Specifically, an executive order must find support in the Constitution.
[01:32.960 --> 01:37.000]  Watering down the Second Amendment in order to confiscate the lawful right of a majority
[01:37.000 --> 01:43.800]  of Americans to protect themselves can hardly mean the laws are being faithfully executed.
[01:43.800 --> 01:49.160]  The conversation has to be based on facts and truth and what we're actually proposing.
[01:49.160 --> 01:54.640]  A big miss for Obama as he failed to explain to all of us what is contained in his latest
[01:54.640 --> 01:59.960]  executive order. Allowing HIPAA to protect doctors that order gun confiscation of their
[01:59.960 --> 02:06.280]  patients based on vague conditions is what's really sending alarm bells ringing, as if
[02:06.280 --> 02:11.200]  the health care system wasn't screwed up enough unconstitutionally by Obama.
[02:11.200 --> 02:16.880]  We heard not only from the gun lobby, but from United States senators that expanding
[02:16.880 --> 02:23.840]  background checks will, not may, will lead to a registry, which will lead to confiscation,
[02:23.840 --> 02:28.600]  which will lead to a tyrannical government. Let's not forget the Gabrielle Giffords thankfully
[02:28.600 --> 02:35.640]  survived the 2011 Tucson shooting by the possibly MK ultra-victimized Jared Lee Loeffner, who
[02:35.640 --> 02:40.600]  erratically declared to the police while victims were still being treated. I just want you
[02:40.600 --> 02:44.920]  to know that I'm the only person that knew about this. Strange.
[02:44.920 --> 02:50.840]  Unfortunately, federal judge John Rohl, a staunch blockade to Obama's future immigration
[02:50.840 --> 02:55.720]  invasion, was murdered along with five others. Talk about a conspiracy.
[02:55.720 --> 03:02.640]  I'm sorry, Cooper. Yes, it is fair to call the conspiracy. What are you saying? Are you
[03:02.640 --> 03:11.120]  suggesting that the notion that we are creating a plot to take everybody's guns away so that
[03:11.120 --> 03:16.160]  we can impose martial law? And while you've been president, we are at the lowest murder
[03:16.160 --> 03:21.480]  rate in our country, all time low for murders. We've been talking about Chicago, but downstate
[03:21.480 --> 03:27.240]  Illinois is closer to Kentucky and everybody hunts down there. And so this is not alien
[03:27.240 --> 03:32.320]  territory to me. I grew up in Kentucky. Trust me, those guns
[03:32.320 --> 03:37.400]  aren't just for hunting. And secondly, Obama, you don't know a damn thing about Kentucky.
[03:37.400 --> 03:41.480]  Well, I've got bad news for all of you that scoff at the word impeachment.
[03:41.480 --> 03:46.720]  Once Obama leaves office, he will have set the table for global government to legally
[03:46.720 --> 03:52.280]  come in and feast on the American public. Obama trade with its laws that bypass the
[03:52.280 --> 03:56.320]  U.S. Congress for the benefit of the banking corporate elite.
[03:56.320 --> 04:02.280]  Obamacare, a middle class destroying Stasi-esque data collection system, masquerading as a
[04:02.280 --> 04:08.200]  health care system. Obamagration, flooding our cities with criminals and jihadists.
[04:08.200 --> 04:14.760]  And now Obama fiscation, a solitary push to reduce the threat posed by armed Americans
[04:14.760 --> 04:19.600]  as the final dish by the New World Order's puppet is presented to the table.
[04:19.600 --> 04:27.360]  By not impeaching Obama, our nationalist apathy will legally and necessarily aid and abet
[04:27.360 --> 04:32.480]  the death of the United States of America. The time is now. Call your representative
[04:32.480 --> 04:41.600]  at 202-224-3121. Operators are standing by. And if your representative needs more information,
[04:41.600 --> 04:45.880]  direct them to the North American Law Center dot orgs. Articles of impeachment of Barack
[04:45.880 --> 04:51.200]  Hussein Obama at the very top of their webpage, John Bown for info wars dot com.
[04:51.200 --> 04:56.560]  We'll be back after the 62nd break. We're fighting for the Republican human liberty.

[06:02.320 --> 06:30.000]  Trashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[06:30.000 --> 06:37.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are broadcasting worldwide on this January 10th, 2016 Sunday
[06:37.480 --> 06:44.880]  live broadcast as we do every Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m. Central Standard Time. I'm your host
[06:44.880 --> 06:53.520]  Alex Jones. You do not want to miss the next two hours. Obviously, it is just incredible
[06:53.520 --> 07:00.040]  the information, the news we've got, top polling firms, top political strategists have hit
[07:00.040 --> 07:08.080]  the panic button in the Republican and Democratic parties right now. Donald J. Trump in three
[07:08.080 --> 07:16.080]  national polls is defeating Hillary Clinton handsomely. In mass, Democrats polled are
[07:16.080 --> 07:22.120]  reporting that upwards of 20% of them will cross over and vote for Donald Trump, ensuring
[07:22.120 --> 07:32.480]  him a landslide Reagan-esque victory in 2016 if they don't assassinate him, if they don't
[07:32.480 --> 07:37.920]  develop a fake scandal that brings him down, and if we have a fair and just election in
[07:37.920 --> 07:44.680]  this country. But I've interviewed Bev Harris and every other major top expert on electronic
[07:44.680 --> 07:53.880]  voting fraud, and it's very hard for the system to beat landslides because there's different
[07:53.880 --> 08:00.960]  districts, different people running the machines, don't engage in fraud, some do, some Republicans
[08:00.960 --> 08:05.960]  cheat, some Democrats cheat. It's all cobbled together, and then voter news services run
[08:05.960 --> 08:11.480]  by the AP will supposedly collate all that and announce the winner, but if it's a landslide,
[08:11.480 --> 08:17.160]  they have trouble cheating because it's so obvious they can't get away with it because
[08:17.160 --> 08:20.920]  the counties, the different districts, the different voting blocks are publishing their
[08:20.920 --> 08:29.200]  numbers. So they say if you're going to steal, steal big, that is true in history, but not
[08:29.200 --> 08:35.440]  in elections. You cannot steal big and get away with it. Ladies and gentlemen, for the
[08:35.440 --> 08:39.240]  first time, I believe Donald Trump may be the next president of the United States. That
[08:39.240 --> 08:43.680]  is a whole other can of worms because he's going to become president right as we collapse
[08:43.680 --> 08:48.600]  into a global depression that every major expert we talk to says is imminent, already
[08:48.600 --> 08:57.600]  happening in most areas of the world. The president isn't a magician. That's what Ron
[08:57.600 --> 09:02.160]  Paul said. If I get elected under the Constitution, I can't fix everything. A lot of this is systemic.
[09:02.160 --> 09:07.080]  So I got to tell you, I've probably talked to a lot of people that are smart. I agree
[09:07.080 --> 09:11.640]  with them. Info wars would be more successful if Hillary Clinton got elected. More people
[09:11.640 --> 09:15.800]  would wake up. More folks would get upset in the hell that's coming. But she might stage
[09:15.800 --> 09:20.920]  false flags bringing pure martial law. I don't think about things like how will I be more
[09:20.920 --> 09:25.160]  successful on air? Because a lot of Republicans say, hey, let's get Hillary in. So what? We'll
[09:25.160 --> 09:29.920]  take over the House and Senate. She'll be a lame duck. We'll impeach her. The Republican
[09:29.920 --> 09:34.840]  leadership likes to work with her too much. And I don't think of things in a Machiavellian
[09:34.840 --> 09:40.240]  way. I mean, I can do it better than the best. That's what we do is brainstorm the enemy
[09:40.240 --> 09:44.600]  operations and then reverse engineer them and expose them before they launch their next
[09:44.600 --> 09:51.000]  attack. But we do it to stop them not to be Machiavelli. We want to build better things.
[09:51.000 --> 09:56.540]  We want life extension technology. We want clean technology. We want space platforms.
[09:56.540 --> 10:06.320]  We want space colonies. We want handshake deals for humanity based on innovation, exploration,
[10:06.320 --> 10:14.040]  not conquest. We don't want strong men, drug lord, war lords running our country like Mexico
[10:14.040 --> 10:23.000]  or Somalia. We want to innovate with the Renaissance. We want our grandkids to be immortal. And
[10:23.000 --> 10:30.740]  that's within grasp. It is very close. We want to be fans of humanity. We want to really
[10:30.740 --> 10:38.520]  enjoy God's promises. We want to win. And screwing people over and brainwashing them
[10:38.520 --> 10:44.600]  and dumbing them down is not what an elite does. You're so elitist, turn humanity loose.
[10:44.600 --> 10:48.760]  If you're so incredible, what are you worried about the general? Why are you putting fluoride
[10:48.760 --> 10:51.640]  in the water? Why are you dumping them down? Why are you teaching them two plus two equals
[10:51.640 --> 10:57.600]  five? Why are you giving them vaccines on record to lower cognitive ability? If you're
[10:57.600 --> 11:05.760]  so powerful, why run? As Yoda told Palpatine. And this is the big epic battle going on.
[11:05.760 --> 11:14.560]  All the rest of this news is window dressing. But Donald Trump, Donald Trump in three national
[11:14.560 --> 11:25.760]  polls and in other major analyses is turbocharging right now. It's absolutely amazing. Economist
[11:25.760 --> 11:33.600]  GOP may win 47 states in general election. The biggest sweep ever. That's the Hill newspaper,
[11:33.600 --> 11:40.800]  not some Trump platform. The U.S. News and World Report. Trump could win it all. Shock
[11:40.800 --> 11:49.280]  poll. 20% of likely Democratic voters to cross over vote Trump poll. Trump beats Hillary
[11:49.280 --> 12:02.200]  in general election matchup. Sylvester Stallone comes out and says, quote, I love Donald Trump.
[12:02.200 --> 12:08.000]  I love Creed movie. It's I don't like the other Rockies and it creates amazing. He deserves
[12:08.000 --> 12:12.120]  an Academy Award for that for his performance on that. The director is a great director
[12:12.120 --> 12:17.560]  as well. But I'm going to just get off that subject. It's all coming up today. Sean Pinnon
[12:17.560 --> 12:22.800]  El Chapo. I wouldn't even get into this. Under the First Amendment, a journalist has a right
[12:22.800 --> 12:28.320]  to interview a criminal in exile. That's the fourth estate. The media is talking about
[12:28.320 --> 12:31.760]  arresting Penn right now because they want to destroy the power of the media to talk
[12:31.760 --> 12:39.160]  to people. That said, Penn, who I've met repeatedly and I'm just going to leave it at that, is
[12:39.160 --> 12:44.280]  not the sharpest knife in the drawer. Everyone sits around telling him how smart he is. I
[12:44.280 --> 12:50.040]  mean, him and Josh Brolin, what a pair. Those two together. But he's just like a baby elephant.
[12:50.040 --> 12:53.360]  Josh Brolin behind him with a, but I'm not going to get an inside baseball in LA and
[12:53.360 --> 12:59.920]  what I've witnessed with my eyeballs at two different parties. And then at a DNC event,
[12:59.920 --> 13:04.080]  I was at covering things behind the scenes, but that said, he's got a right out of the
[13:04.080 --> 13:10.240]  First Amendment and El Chapo used to be CIA drug trafficker. And I'm going to show you
[13:10.240 --> 13:14.040]  those articles on that later. They're just burning him now because they launched that
[13:14.040 --> 13:17.720]  whole drug war to basically collapse Mexico. The drug war allowed it to happen. I'll get
[13:17.720 --> 13:23.800]  into that. Continuing though, the Washington Post comes out on Thursday and goes after
[13:23.800 --> 13:28.120]  Hillary and admits that Bill's settled a bunch of rape cases and could be the next
[13:28.120 --> 13:32.640]  Bill Cosby. That shows you they're turning against her. Meanwhile, Kathleen Willie, who
[13:32.640 --> 13:37.360]  we've interviewed many times in the last 16 years, thanks Donald Trump for highlighting
[13:37.360 --> 13:42.400]  Bill Clinton's history with women, urges more victims to come forward. Is Bill Clinton's
[13:42.400 --> 13:48.600]  Bill Cosby moment coming? Well, Roger Stone's on Mother's Tomorrow on the weekday show and
[13:48.600 --> 13:56.160]  he's, let's just say kind of like the shadow chancellor, the shadow campaign. Anyways,
[13:56.160 --> 14:01.200]  torpedoes are fired. They've already hit Hillary hard and Bill hard. There's about five more
[14:01.200 --> 14:07.520]  torpedoes already in the water. And there's big fat, juicy, high explosive information
[14:07.520 --> 14:13.800]  warfare weapons on their way about to hit Bush. And we're going to watch old Jeb go
[14:13.800 --> 14:25.640]  into the water. I love it. Two months ago in my office, Stone laid out the battle plan
[14:25.640 --> 14:34.640]  and it was beautiful. And we're seeing it take place right now. Hillary is on fire and
[14:34.640 --> 14:38.280]  the flames are getting into the magazine of her battleship. And when they get into those
[14:38.280 --> 14:49.600]  shells, into those munitions, it's going to be beautiful when she death stars. And Bill,
[14:49.600 --> 14:54.440]  another reason they're going down is Hillary's sick and so is Bill. And even though globalists
[14:54.440 --> 14:59.040]  hate the fact they've got all the blackmail material and their insiders and we're CIA agents
[14:59.040 --> 15:04.800]  since they were like 22 years old, it doesn't matter because wolves see them weak and Hillary
[15:04.800 --> 15:11.200]  stumbling around and Bill all stumbling around and the globalist wolves are snarling and
[15:11.200 --> 15:19.640]  stalking and can't wait to feast on the cleanse and they are just ready to fall. I just can't
[15:19.640 --> 15:24.200]  wait till the moment I can announce the fall has begun. They're just teetering right now.
[15:24.200 --> 15:30.320]  It's criminals just teetering on their clay feet and as they fall, so much other evil
[15:30.320 --> 15:38.520]  falls. Does it mean we're winning? It means we're in the fight. Mass radical Islamic rape
[15:38.520 --> 15:44.320]  gangs going crazy in Germany is now imploding. That's Rod's imploding. We've got huge news
[15:44.320 --> 15:50.440]  on the economy, huge news on what's happening in Spain that has portend and affects what's

[20:02.320 --> 20:05.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:05.320 --> 20:21.320]  I'm up here in space. I'm looking down on you. My laser's trace. Everything you do.
[20:21.320 --> 20:29.320]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[20:29.320 --> 20:32.320]  I'm here in space.
[20:32.320 --> 20:38.320]  These lyrics are from the 80s talking about NSA spying. No longer a conspiracy theory,
[20:38.320 --> 20:47.320]  hm? You think you private lies. You've nothing of the kind. There is no true escape I'm watching
[20:47.320 --> 21:01.320]  all the time. I'm elemental. My sight is clean. I am perpetual. Keep the country free. No,
[21:01.320 --> 21:05.320]  they use the NSA and these control grids for private globalist interest to blackmail and
[21:05.320 --> 21:11.320]  control Congress. They told you that over a decade ago with whistleblowers, and now it's
[21:11.320 --> 21:16.320]  all been confirmed by the former technical director of the National Security Agency,
[21:16.320 --> 21:25.320]  William Benny, right here on this broadcast. In this universe, there's always an equal
[21:25.320 --> 21:34.320]  reaction to tyranny. And in the end, it always trumps it, pun intended.
[21:34.320 --> 21:40.320]  All right, let's launch into the news here. I mentioned the Trump situation and I'm going
[21:40.320 --> 21:46.320]  to go into that in the next segment. I want to get to other news right now, but I don't
[21:46.320 --> 21:51.320]  completely trust Donald Trump. I don't like some of the things Donald Trump says. I'll
[21:51.320 --> 21:56.320]  be quite honest with you. I agree with about 90% of what he says. I've seen him, though,
[21:56.320 --> 22:01.320]  when he's wrong about something, change his views and say, when I'm wrong, I change him
[22:01.320 --> 22:13.320]  on my show a few weeks ago. But that said, I know Jeb Bush is absolutely horrible. And
[22:13.320 --> 22:18.320]  I know Hillary Clinton is absolutely horrible. And I know those families are as thick as
[22:18.320 --> 22:28.320]  thieves. I'm not a gambler. But if I'm going through like Indiana Jones, some Mayan temple
[22:28.320 --> 22:35.320]  big boulder starts rolling down one passage at me and there's no way to get out and spikes
[22:35.320 --> 22:39.320]  are popping up on the floor. And there's only one other way to run. I'm going to run the
[22:39.320 --> 22:46.320]  other way. It's not even a lesser of two evils issue. It's that I can't go this way with
[22:46.320 --> 22:51.320]  Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton. I've got to support Donald Trump. And then I see the entire
[22:51.320 --> 22:57.320]  establishment attacking Donald Trump. And then Donald Trump reaches out through me through
[22:57.320 --> 23:04.320]  his shadow campaign head. And I'm going to leave it at that. I mean, what are you supposed
[23:04.320 --> 23:14.320]  to do at that point? It's like the jail door opens and where the resistors were here to
[23:14.320 --> 23:18.320]  help. I mean, I don't know. And then Governor Abbott comes out and says, you want to confiscate
[23:18.320 --> 23:24.320]  our guns, come and take them and start to state move nationwide to basically veto what Obama's
[23:24.320 --> 23:29.320]  doing? I mean, that's even more powerful. And impeachment moves are happening. I'm talking
[23:29.320 --> 23:34.320]  to the congressional aides and Congress people during this weekend. You're going to hear
[23:34.320 --> 23:39.320]  in the next week to two weeks what the move is. And let me tell you, it takes some organizing
[23:39.320 --> 23:45.320]  behind the scenes and it's dangerous. You think our phones are tapped? And the only reason
[23:45.320 --> 23:50.320]  I'm so prominent in this fact is there's so many cowardly men in America. You know what?
[23:50.320 --> 23:56.320]  It's beyond cowardly men. The average man, even if there's some guy worth $100 million
[23:56.320 --> 24:00.320]  that started his own business and is a great guy and really smart or whatever, they just
[24:00.320 --> 24:05.320]  don't see themselves as a fighter or that it's their role to be involved in politics.
[24:05.320 --> 24:18.320]  It's like that's something Martians do. No, it's something free men do. Texas Governor
[24:18.320 --> 24:23.320]  challenges Obama on gun control, come and take it. Then he came out and called for a
[24:23.320 --> 24:29.320]  con con. On Friday, that article was posted by Drudge, had over a million people as of
[24:29.320 --> 24:33.320]  yesterday when I looked at it online. So I can look at the back end, over a million people
[24:33.320 --> 24:39.320]  on Info Wars read our article. Thousands of websites obviously reposted it. And now
[24:39.320 --> 24:43.320]  all these other governors are saying, we're going to look at seconding your resolution
[24:43.320 --> 24:54.320]  to begin a constitutional convention of the states to basically veto the federal government.
[24:54.320 --> 25:00.320]  Marco Rubio has joined him, which I don't particularly like. That's CNN politics, but the point is
[25:00.320 --> 25:09.320]  that's 24, 48 hours after he called for it. People say, well, I can't trust a con con.
[25:09.320 --> 25:13.320]  They can rewrite the whole constitution during one. They're already doing it with executive
[25:13.320 --> 25:18.320]  orders. I used to be against a con con, but when they're already gotten you seven ways
[25:18.320 --> 25:26.320]  to Sunday, you don't have a choice. We're in a death battle. Obamacare is meant to bankrupt
[25:26.320 --> 25:31.320]  the country on record, shutting off a thousand power plants. That's a third of them is meant
[25:31.320 --> 25:38.320]  to bankrupt us. We are being gang raped. We are being brought low like a pimp gets a young
[25:38.320 --> 25:43.320]  16 year old girl that runs away. This is a standard deal. It's Mexico, the US, Europe.
[25:43.320 --> 25:48.320]  It's all the same system for thousands of years. She runs away from mommy and daddy. He gets
[25:48.320 --> 25:53.320]  her. He treats her good. He gives her food, takes care of her, gets her in, gets her in debt,
[25:53.320 --> 25:57.320]  gets her on drugs. Two years later, he's putting cigarettes out on her and kills her in a parking
[25:57.320 --> 26:03.320]  lot and throws her in a ditch after 5,000 guys that basically had sex with her. That's
[26:03.320 --> 26:08.320]  what the globalists are doing to America. And I'm not going to sit here and watch them
[26:08.320 --> 26:18.320]  put cigarettes out on their eyeballs. This country is a woman. Every great ship's a woman.
[26:18.320 --> 26:24.320]  Every field you plant's a woman. Every factory you build's a woman. Every business you build's
[26:24.320 --> 26:28.320]  a woman. Everything that produces something's a woman. And I'm not going to sit here and
[26:28.320 --> 26:37.320]  watch Columbia, America, raped by you people. And I'm not going to sit there and watch it
[26:37.320 --> 26:46.320]  anymore. This country is not here for you to slap around and beat with coat hangers because
[26:46.320 --> 26:55.320]  you're a bunch of pimps and think it's fun to desecrate humanity. It's over. And if you
[26:55.320 --> 27:00.320]  want to fight, you know you're going to get one. You've lost every time you've tried scum
[27:00.320 --> 27:06.320]  and you're going to lose this time too. Nobody's going to stop humanity's exploration. Nobody's
[27:06.320 --> 27:10.320]  going to stop our upward vision. Nobody's going to stop where we're going. I'm going to go to
[27:10.320 --> 27:13.320]  break as I went too long. I'm going to come back with some of the clips I didn't get to,
[27:13.320 --> 27:20.320]  some I did on Friday of the unbelievable Thursday night town hall with Obama, that I've probably
[27:20.320 --> 27:28.320]  watched this clip. I don't want to exaggerate. 20 something times since Friday. I first
[27:28.320 --> 27:32.320]  saw it Thursday and I played it Friday and it was so weird. I watched it like four or
[27:32.320 --> 27:36.320]  five times that day. I watched it four or five times yesterday and today I just watched it
[27:36.320 --> 27:42.320]  like six, seven, eight times. It was in John Bowne's report we played earlier where it's
[27:42.320 --> 27:48.320]  done on purpose. It's all scripted between Obama and Anderson Cooper. And they go, is
[27:48.320 --> 27:52.320]  it a conspiracy to get your guns? Yeah, it's a conspiracy. We're, it's a conspiracy. We're
[27:52.320 --> 27:58.320]  coming for your guns and they just, it's the weirdest thing I've ever seen. And then later
[27:58.320 --> 28:05.320]  in the hour plus long deal, they do it again. And I hadn't even paid attention to that clip
[28:05.320 --> 28:09.320]  because my kids go to about nine o'clock at night. So I didn't watch it live. I spent
[28:09.320 --> 28:14.320]  time with them. Got home about six, dinner, hung out and all that. Watched some TV, played
[28:14.320 --> 28:22.320]  a board game with them, put them to bed. My son got up and knew what I was going to do
[28:22.320 --> 28:25.320]  and came in and said, can I, can I watch it? And he's all in the politics. I said, yeah,
[28:25.320 --> 28:30.320]  you can stay up till 10 or 11. And we watched the, we watched the CNN deal at CNN, the whole
[28:30.320 --> 28:35.320]  town hall. And I was like, yeah, I know, I know, I know he's lying. I was writing notes
[28:35.320 --> 28:40.320]  and man, these people are crazy. I mean, I was watching Obama and Cooper, the CIA guy,
[28:40.320 --> 28:46.320]  and this is freaks man. They want to mount that what they are is wild hunters and they
[28:46.320 --> 28:53.320]  want to mount us, the King 1776 on their wall. That's it. They're like hunting us. This is
[28:53.320 --> 29:18.320]  the whole deal. It's a, it's a death battle.
[29:18.320 --> 29:44.320]  It's a death battle.
[29:44.320 --> 29:49.320]  The resolution says that we are a nation of laws and separation of powers. And this lets
[29:49.320 --> 29:54.320]  the president know that we are not going to put up with his ability to go around the Constitution.
[29:54.320 --> 30:18.320]  This is the end Mac at a reporting for info wars.com.

[32:58.320 --> 33:05.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:28.320 --> 33:35.320]  So raising the debt doesn't promote overspending being in debt.
[33:59.320 --> 34:04.320]  And Obama's not coming after your guns either. And you can keep your doctor. Obama cares free.
[34:04.320 --> 34:08.320]  And there's no penalty and there's no death panels, which they all admit wasn't true now.
[34:08.320 --> 34:14.320]  You can read the bill and see it. They just know that 98% of Americans literally do not
[34:14.320 --> 34:19.320]  go read bills. I'll be honest with you, the final healthcare bill was like 2,000 pages
[34:19.320 --> 34:24.320]  long. I just went to the senator's warning about it and searched the subsections and
[34:24.320 --> 34:28.320]  word at death panels and written by foreign insurance companies and lowered standard of
[34:28.320 --> 34:37.320]  care and increased prices and screwed everybody. And then goober, grouper, whatever his name
[34:37.320 --> 34:44.320]  is, Jonathan grouper, comes out and says, yeah, I was hired to lie to the public and
[34:44.320 --> 34:51.320]  screw everybody. Thank God the public's so stupid. And then the media even tried to
[34:51.320 --> 35:01.320]  spin that. And Obama said, I don't know grouper. There's all these videos. Thank grouper for
[35:01.320 --> 35:09.320]  writing it all and helping me as the top genius on all this. It's like a language. It's like
[35:09.320 --> 35:14.320]  I speak globalist. I'm not a globalist, but I study their lies, their deception, how they
[35:14.320 --> 35:21.320]  speak. And it's like the dumbest, stupidest candy land game. It's not even hard. They
[35:21.320 --> 35:26.320]  just screw everybody, lie to everybody, rob everybody, tax everybody while exempting
[35:26.320 --> 35:32.320]  themselves and then prancing around saying, we're liberal. We're liberal. Don't be racist.
[35:32.320 --> 35:37.320]  Let us run your lives. The average person says, okay, you're the authority figure. I'll do
[35:37.320 --> 35:45.320]  what you say. Here, let me bend over. They've got a baseball bat with nails on it and they
[35:45.320 --> 35:52.320]  tell you it's going to be the greatest feeling in your life. Let me tell you it ain't. Don't
[35:52.320 --> 35:58.320]  even have the common decency to, what are they saying, full metal jacket to give the guy a,
[35:58.320 --> 36:04.320]  but it's like all these powerball people. I mean, they've rigged the powerball. It's all a scam.
[36:04.320 --> 36:10.320]  You got to get better chance of being struck by lightning five times than to win it. But
[36:10.320 --> 36:14.320]  the average bozo goes out there and does it because they want to think there's some magic
[36:14.320 --> 36:19.320]  unicorn that's going to make them successful when the magic unicorn's in your heart and mind
[36:19.320 --> 36:25.320]  to be able to create ideas and businesses and to build things and to be an actor in life,
[36:25.320 --> 36:30.320]  not a spectator. I'm going to stop right there because I want to get into Trump, leading
[36:30.320 --> 36:35.320]  the polls against Hillary. I want to get into the latest Muslim rape gangs. I want to get into
[36:35.320 --> 36:41.320]  very positive news in Catalan voting to separate from Spain. Why that's so important. The
[36:41.320 --> 36:52.320]  latest on Obama and Hillary and the whole rape crisis, Sean Penn and El Chapo, all of it.
[36:52.320 --> 36:56.320]  But before I do that, I want to go to some of these Obama clips because these are really
[36:56.320 --> 37:07.320]  important. The first one is the wife of Chris Kyle, the Navy SEAL, says, why don't we celebrate
[37:07.320 --> 37:14.320]  lower murder rates? Now, remember, Obama then starts stumbling and has to admit murder rates
[37:14.320 --> 37:21.320]  are down 61%. I kept saying 51, 52, but I've been corrected by top statistician on the
[37:21.320 --> 37:29.320]  air about the fact, but the Justice Department says it's over 50% because gun ownership is
[37:29.320 --> 37:34.320]  going up. Well, Obama says it's not gun ownership. In fact, the areas with guns have higher crime.
[37:34.320 --> 37:39.320]  That's not true. Chicago, New York, D.C., Mexico, places that have taken the guns at the
[37:39.320 --> 37:44.320]  highest crime rate. I mean, he is lying to people. Can you believe that he could lie?
[37:44.320 --> 37:48.320]  The guy that says raising the debt doesn't raise the debt or two plus two equals five.
[37:48.320 --> 37:54.320]  I mean, can you believe he would lie again? It's like saying, can you believe Yosemite
[37:54.320 --> 38:01.320]  Sam has a red beard and is short and fires his six shooters and, I mean, can you believe
[38:01.320 --> 38:12.320]  that the Coyote in Looney Tunes is a Coyote? I mean, whoa, whoa, I mean, whoa, I mean,
[38:12.320 --> 38:17.320]  if you believe he's lying, you're a racist. Nobody wants your guns. Everywhere they control,
[38:17.320 --> 38:20.320]  they take all the guns, but nobody wants your guns. They're just saying, we're just going
[38:20.320 --> 38:24.320]  to take them and put you on a secret list and just swat team you and just shut everything
[38:24.320 --> 38:29.320]  down and shut down gun shows and just do whatever we want outside of law, outside of Congress
[38:29.320 --> 38:34.320]  and Congress get in line and just, it doesn't matter. Just everything's fine though. And
[38:34.320 --> 38:42.320]  fund Al Qaeda and fund ISIS and just everything's fine though. So she says, why don't you celebrate
[38:42.320 --> 38:49.320]  this? And he lies. Here it is. Murder rate. That's a big deal. And yet I think most of
[38:49.320 --> 38:53.320]  us in this country feel like it could happen at any moment. They could happen to any of
[38:53.320 --> 38:57.320]  us. We cut the front off of that. Let's start it again. When you talk about the start again,
[38:57.320 --> 39:01.320]  no big deal. Let's just go back to the front where she says all time low for murder rate.
[39:01.320 --> 39:05.320]  That's a big deal. And yet I think most of us in this country feel like it could happen
[39:05.320 --> 39:09.320]  at any moment. They could happen to any of us at any time. And I'm almost finished just
[39:09.320 --> 39:14.320]  when you talk about the NRA and after a mass shooting that gun sales go up, I would argue
[39:14.320 --> 39:18.320]  that it's not necessarily, I think somebody's going to come take my gun for me. But I want
[39:18.320 --> 39:23.320]  the hope and the hope that I have the right to protect myself. And Obama has bodyguards
[39:23.320 --> 39:27.320]  we pay for, but he wants us to be disarmed. I mean, what a piece of filth. I feel I need,
[39:27.320 --> 39:31.320]  just like your wife said on that part. Impressive clothes. Game over, Jackoff. Game over. And
[39:31.320 --> 39:34.320]  I understand that background. You know what? I mean, we're done, dude. We're done. You
[39:34.320 --> 39:40.320]  scumbag. I'm as good as you filth. I got my own gun. You piece of trash. I'm going to
[39:40.320 --> 39:47.320]  defend myself. We're done. Go to hell. Go to hell, you elitist bastard. I'm not your slave,
[39:47.320 --> 39:52.320]  you son of a bitch. Excuse me. Let me make a couple of points. First of all, thanks to
[39:52.320 --> 39:56.320]  your husband for his... Oh yeah, thanks. They blow up Navy SEALs to cover up this thing,
[39:56.320 --> 40:01.320]  but not, right? They hate his guts. I mean, just shut up. He and your family have shown
[40:01.320 --> 40:05.320]  him. Oh yeah, he was a destroyer of the military. He has some more red high heels. I mean, he
[40:05.320 --> 40:10.320]  can't make this up. Number two. Trainees of the Army will wreck everything. What you said
[40:10.320 --> 40:16.320]  about murder rates and violent crime generally is something that we don't celebrate enough.
[40:16.320 --> 40:21.320]  The fact is that... Because the media lies about it all. Violent crime has been steadily
[40:21.320 --> 40:27.320]  declining across America for a pretty long time. Sixteen, one percent. And you wouldn't
[40:27.320 --> 40:33.320]  always know it by watching television. Yeah, because you could just... Oh, it paused.
[40:33.320 --> 40:38.320]  Because we have the former Attorney General at the RTF National Convention on C-SPAN
[40:38.320 --> 40:43.320]  saying brainwash the public and tell them guns are killing everybody and are the number
[40:43.320 --> 40:49.320]  one threat, literally brainwashing them as the quote. I mean, folks, you got more people
[40:49.320 --> 40:56.320]  die falling in the shower. It's like 15,000 a year. Then die of guns. You understand
[40:56.320 --> 41:03.320]  that, right? And 7,000 plus blow their own heads off. You got bone cancer. I thought
[41:03.320 --> 41:07.320]  you're for right to die. I'm not for suicide, but let me tell you, I got bone cancer and
[41:07.320 --> 41:13.320]  I feel like I'm being put in a woodchipper for a month. I might do it. So half the...
[41:13.320 --> 41:20.320]  More than half the deaths are suicide, jerk. Again, it's a total phantom menace. Total
[41:20.320 --> 41:29.320]  phantom. Total fraud. Guns are incredibly rare killing people. It's bull. Let's go back
[41:29.320 --> 41:35.320]  to it. Most cities are much safer than they were 10 years ago. The cities we were taking
[41:35.320 --> 41:38.320]  the guns were 20 years ago. Chicago, New York, D.C.
[41:38.320 --> 41:45.320]  Now, the actual cities are safe. They're what's not safe. The reason for that is because there's
[41:45.320 --> 41:52.320]  more gun ownership. Because if you look at where are the areas with the highest gun ownership,
[41:52.320 --> 41:56.320]  those are the places in some cases where the crime rate hasn't dropped down that much.
[41:56.320 --> 41:57.320]  Just group.
[41:57.320 --> 42:05.320]  There's pretty stiff restrictions on gun ownership. In some of those places, the crimes dropped
[42:05.320 --> 42:09.320]  really quickly. So I'm not sure that there's a wonder why.
[42:09.320 --> 42:13.320]  You're not sure. You're not sure. Oh, man, they're so upset that the guncultures grow
[42:13.320 --> 42:17.320]  and all the liberals are out shooting guns. All the feminists are out shooting guns. All
[42:17.320 --> 42:21.320]  the feminists are saying men might be okay and actually going and getting a good man.
[42:21.320 --> 42:25.320]  Oh, my gosh, it's wonderful. Oh, my gosh, I'm having kids. Oh, my gosh, I'm a human.
[42:25.320 --> 42:30.320]  And the globalist like an alien force from trillion light years away is just freaking
[42:30.320 --> 42:35.320]  out. Kill the humans. We hate them. I mean, they're scum. I'm going to come back and play
[42:35.320 --> 42:39.320]  more clips. Then I'll get into Trump. Then I'll get into Joe Biggs report about radical
[42:39.320 --> 42:46.320]  Islamic centers getting hundreds of millions of dollars, one group alone, a year in the
[42:46.320 --> 42:51.320]  U.S. Billions total of taxpayer money to actually set up Sharia law training centers.
[42:51.320 --> 43:09.320]  I used to hear this ago. Shut up to listeners. That's not happening. It is. It has happened.
[43:09.320 --> 43:24.320]  That's a little too epic that Hollywood action adventure science fiction voice I'm using,
[43:24.320 --> 43:29.320]  but quite frankly, that's how I feel like I should be talking about what happens when

[46:00.320 --> 46:06.320]  We've always offered five months free. But since I announced six free months a few days
[46:06.320 --> 46:13.320]  ago, we have seen record numbers of sign ups. Prisonplanet.tv began 15 years ago. It's grown

[47:17.320 --> 47:43.320]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. Live from Austin, Texas,
[47:43.320 --> 47:48.320]  in the broadcasting world wide. It's Alex Jones.
[47:48.320 --> 47:54.320]  So the Monopoly McDonald's game was rigged and the Powerball fears ago was rigged. But
[47:54.320 --> 48:00.320]  don't be a conspiracy theorist and say this one's rigged. Just trust the system. Raising
[48:00.320 --> 48:08.320]  the debt doesn't raise the debt and you didn't build that business and nobody's coming after
[48:08.320 --> 48:17.320]  your guns. But MSNBC says the state does own your children. But we should all just lay
[48:17.320 --> 48:22.320]  down and go along with that. Let me now get back to one of these other clips. So I played
[48:22.320 --> 48:29.320]  the clip before the widow of Chris Kyle, one of the most decorated Navy SEALs in US history's
[48:29.320 --> 48:35.320]  comments about why don't we celebrate the massive crime rate drop thanks to gun ownership
[48:35.320 --> 48:40.320]  and Obama then starts lying. But he admits that crime rates are down because it's not
[48:40.320 --> 48:45.320]  gun ownership. But there's an epidemic and gun crime's worse. So turn your guns in. Oops,
[48:45.320 --> 48:47.320]  but it is way down.
[48:47.320 --> 48:55.320]  But then we have this bizarre video of President Obama saying yes, there's a plot, an
[48:55.320 --> 48:59.320]  conspiracy to get the guns with Anderson Cooper. And if you watch it, he's actually saying
[48:59.320 --> 49:07.320]  there's a plot. It's bizarre. And that ties to the mayor pro team in Austin, Mike Martinez,
[49:07.320 --> 49:18.320]  who works for Bloomberg. He's gotten funding from him, openly saying that, hey, once we
[49:18.320 --> 49:22.320]  register your guns, we will confiscate them, which they've done all over the world. So let's
[49:22.320 --> 49:24.320]  go to this clip of Obama with Anderson Cooper.
[49:24.320 --> 49:29.320]  Is it fair to call it a conspiracy? I mean, a lot of people really believe this deeply,
[49:29.320 --> 49:32.320]  that they just don't trust you.
[49:32.320 --> 49:39.320]  I'm sorry, Cooper. Yes, it is fair to call it a conspiracy. What are you saying? Are you
[49:39.320 --> 49:47.320]  suggesting that the notion that we are creating a plot to take everybody's guns away so that
[49:47.320 --> 49:49.320]  we can impose martial law?
[49:49.320 --> 49:54.320]  Is it a conspiracy? Yes, that is a conspiracy. I would hope that you would agree with that.
[49:54.320 --> 49:57.320]  Is that controversial, except on some websites?
[49:57.320 --> 50:03.320]  There are certainly a lot of people who just have a fundamental distrust that you do not
[50:03.320 --> 50:08.320]  want to go further and further and further down this road.
[50:08.320 --> 50:14.320]  I mean, I'm only going to be here for another year. I don't know. When would I have started
[50:14.320 --> 50:16.320]  this enterprise?
[50:16.320 --> 50:20.320]  No, you're a front man. You're like shark teeth.
[50:20.320 --> 50:23.320]  I come from the state of Illinois, which...
[50:23.320 --> 50:28.320]  He goes on to say it's pro-gun, turn him off, which we know is total anti-gun, moralized
[50:28.320 --> 50:35.320]  for old. Now, let's go to the clip of Mike Martinez a few years ago in Austin, Texas,
[50:35.320 --> 50:41.320]  at an anti-gun rally. And there's a fellow with a sign saying no to confiscation.
[50:41.320 --> 50:45.320]  And he says, you can keep your sign because after we do this, registration was what they
[50:45.320 --> 50:49.320]  were trying to pass at the state level. We're going to do that.
[50:49.320 --> 50:55.320]  And if you're a radio listener, it's powerful, but if you see the video, it's incredible.
[50:55.320 --> 50:59.320]  Because this is what's happened in every other country. Once they register, they confiscate.
[50:59.320 --> 51:03.320]  And that's what Obama's now doing outside of law, executively. Here it is.
[51:03.320 --> 51:08.320]  Austin City's council member, Mike Martinez.
[51:08.320 --> 51:10.320]  Because the sign says no gun ban.
[51:10.320 --> 51:16.320]  Thank you so much. I've got a proclamation on the African-American city council that we want to present.
[51:16.320 --> 51:20.320]  I want to say a couple of words, and I'll be brief.
[51:20.320 --> 51:24.320]  First of all, to the gentleman who's dying for attention, someone needs to inform them
[51:24.320 --> 51:31.320]  that there is no gun ban currently. But because of the work that we're doing here today,
[51:31.320 --> 51:36.320]  we will make your sign legitimate shortly. So you hang on to that.
[51:36.320 --> 51:42.320]  We will make your sign legitimate so you hang on to that.
[51:42.320 --> 51:48.320]  I mean, there's more than 15 cities run by Democrats that have banned all guns in this country.
[51:48.320 --> 51:53.320]  In the area they're in control of. And they sit there when handgun control incorporated,
[51:53.320 --> 52:01.320]  the Brady Center, the UN, all say they want to quote abolition on civilian ownership of firearms
[52:01.320 --> 52:06.320]  because it threatens the legitimate power monopoly of the state.
[52:06.320 --> 52:12.320]  That's a quote from the UN July 7, 2000 in the UN tree.
[52:12.320 --> 52:16.320]  That was the treaty adopted then.
[52:16.320 --> 52:21.320]  A total abolition of civilian firearms ownership because it threatens the legitimate power monopoly of the state.
[52:21.320 --> 52:27.320]  And there is a power monopoly in North Korea where the state only has guns and it's hell on earth.
[52:27.320 --> 52:32.320]  I hate even quoting lies that a power monopoly of the state is good.
[52:32.320 --> 52:38.320]  And imagine this mayor guarded by armed police says to a guy with a sign peacefully protesting,
[52:38.320 --> 52:47.320]  you keep your sign, stop gunman, because once we pass this, we're going to make that sign a reality.
[52:47.320 --> 52:51.320]  And I liked the Austin police chief in many ways, but he was in here right after that happened.
[52:51.320 --> 52:58.320]  He said, Alex, he didn't mean that. That's not what he said. The guy in the crowd said that.
[52:58.320 --> 53:01.320]  They were really scared of that clip.
[53:01.320 --> 53:07.320]  No, that's what Mike Martinez said on living color video.
[53:07.320 --> 53:12.320]  And I mean, I could go join the elite to and call for disarming the public and they'd open every door to me.
[53:12.320 --> 53:15.320]  I'm not going to do that. I don't want to hate Mike Martinez.
[53:15.320 --> 53:21.320]  It's like, wow, you really are a Lex Luthor wannabe, though, with that shaved head. I mean, man, you really are bad guys.
[53:21.320 --> 53:24.320]  I mean, you're a piece of crap.
[53:24.320 --> 53:33.320]  I mean, go to Nigeria or North Korea or somewhere else where they've taken all the guns and you live like a slave.
[53:33.320 --> 53:36.320]  A couple thousand innocent people get killed a year by guns.
[53:36.320 --> 53:39.320]  You can't penalize everybody else because of it.
[53:39.320 --> 53:46.320]  Let me tell you, out of three hundred and thirty million people, well, three hundred and eighty million to count all other folks that are here.
[53:46.320 --> 53:56.320]  Being wrongfully killed with a gun, I mean, you got a better chance of basically having a lightning strike here or something.
[53:56.320 --> 54:01.320]  I mean, it's real rare. They don't care. They make it the big issue.
[54:01.320 --> 54:07.320]  Let's go back to another clip here.
[54:07.320 --> 54:19.320]  Let's go ahead and go to this clip where Reverend Pigler, whatever his name is, says, why can't we title guns like cars and have insurance and have biometrics?
[54:19.320 --> 54:22.320]  Obama calls for that because the power to tax is the power to destroy.
[54:22.320 --> 54:31.320]  Obamacare is insurance companies with a private tax, multi-nationally, foreign groups on us and the Supreme Court said so.
[54:31.320 --> 54:38.320]  So you can't penalize someone preemptively. It's like, why can't we have insurance on speech?
[54:38.320 --> 54:42.320]  Because it's a chilling effect. It's a prior constraint.
[54:42.320 --> 54:49.320]  And they use insurance to basically end activities they don't want, like diving boards and merry-go-rounds and swings.
[54:49.320 --> 54:56.320]  The nanny state is the domestication of the public and it doesn't keep us safe.
[54:56.320 --> 55:03.320]  But this pack of lawyers want to create a dictatorship and exempt themselves from it.
[55:03.320 --> 55:04.320]  Let's go to that clip.
[55:04.320 --> 55:10.320]  The reality is that I don't understand why we can't title guns just like cars.
[55:10.320 --> 55:16.320]  If I have a car and I give it to you, Mr. President, and I don't touch for a title and you're in an accident, it's on me.
[55:16.320 --> 55:19.320]  We don't take cars away by putting titles on them.
[55:19.320 --> 55:21.320]  Why can't we do that with guns?
[55:21.320 --> 55:27.320]  Every gun in New York itself, somebody who's buying 200 guns, selling them on the streets, if they can't transfer those titles,
[55:27.320 --> 55:30.320]  then they're going to be held responsible for the guns that they sell.
[55:30.320 --> 55:40.320]  Issues like licensing registration, that's an area where there's just not enough national consensus at this stage to even consider it.
[55:40.320 --> 55:47.320]  And part of it is people's concern that that becomes a prelude to taking people's guns away.
[55:47.320 --> 55:56.320]  One of those areas that I talked about at the speech, part of the proposal, is developing smart gun technology.
[55:56.320 --> 55:57.320]  Demand all the previous guns.
[55:57.320 --> 55:59.320]  Now this is an interesting example.
[55:59.320 --> 56:00.320]  I don't exactly understand...
[56:00.320 --> 56:02.320]  Talk to your smartphone and the spies on you?
[56:02.320 --> 56:05.320]  There will be somebody in the audience who explains it to me.
[56:05.320 --> 56:16.320]  Back in 1997, the CEO of Colt said, we can design or are starting to develop guns where you can only use it if you've got a chip.
[56:16.320 --> 56:18.320]  And Colt's totally in bed with the government.
[56:18.320 --> 56:19.320]  Band or bracelet.
[56:19.320 --> 56:20.320]  I love Colt.
[56:20.320 --> 56:25.320]  Band protects your two-year-old or three-year-old.
[56:25.320 --> 56:26.320]  Love my Python.
[56:26.320 --> 56:27.320]  Love my M4s.
[56:27.320 --> 56:29.320]  But band, it's a bad company.
[56:29.320 --> 56:36.320]  A boycott was called against them and they had to back off of developing that technology.
[56:36.320 --> 56:37.320]  Yeah, that's right.
[56:37.320 --> 56:39.320]  The same was Smith and Wesson.
[56:39.320 --> 56:44.320]  They were in a partnership, the other manufacturers out.
[56:44.320 --> 56:48.320]  They were attacked by the NRA as surrendering.
[56:48.320 --> 56:50.320]  Because they were.
[56:50.320 --> 56:52.320]  To me, this does not make sense.
[56:52.320 --> 56:54.320]  He just keeps saying, lower your defenses.
[56:54.320 --> 56:55.320]  Lower your defenses.
[56:55.320 --> 56:56.320]  I love you.
[56:56.320 --> 56:57.320]  I'm your friend.
[56:57.320 --> 56:58.320]  No, you're not.
[56:58.320 --> 57:00.320]  You're a known globalist operative liar.
[57:00.320 --> 57:02.320]  He wanted to purchase a firearm.
[57:02.320 --> 57:03.320]  Let's go to break.
[57:03.320 --> 57:04.320]  Shut him up.
[57:04.320 --> 57:05.320]  We're going to come back with a second hour.
[57:05.320 --> 57:06.320]  I'm going to finish more clips.
[57:06.320 --> 57:10.320]  I'm going to get into Donald Trump leading a national polls against Hillary.
[57:10.320 --> 57:13.320]  I'm going to get into the giant Muslim right games.
[57:13.320 --> 57:16.320]  Rape games that are running around Europe.
[57:16.320 --> 57:18.320]  And that cover up and bloating.
[57:18.320 --> 57:21.320]  I'm going to get into Bill Clinton connected to all these rapes.
[57:21.320 --> 57:22.320]  That's coming out.
[57:22.320 --> 57:24.320]  I'm going to get into the economic news.
[57:24.320 --> 57:27.320]  I'm going to get into El Chapo and Sean Penn.
[57:27.320 --> 57:32.320]  I'm going to get into so much more straight ahead in the second hour.
[57:32.320 --> 57:38.320]  Now, I know the NFL is more important than keeping your job or having your guns or your kids or private property.
[57:38.320 --> 57:39.320]  But we're weirdos.
[57:39.320 --> 57:43.320]  We're going to cover freedom straight ahead, stay with us, second hour.
[57:43.320 --> 58:12.320]  Tell friends and family tune in right now.
[58:13.320 --> 58:39.320]  We'll be right back.
[58:39.320 --> 59:05.320]  We'll be right back.
[59:05.320 --> 59:31.320]  We'll be right back.
[59:31.320 --> 59:58.320]  We'll be right back.
[59:58.320 --> 01:00:07.320]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:19.320]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:21.320]  Locked and loaded for a second hour.
[01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:23.320]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:28.320]  We're going through Obama clips.
[01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:34.320]  I don't want to air a Joe Biggs report on these U.S. taxpayer funded Islamic centers across the United States.
[01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:38.320]  We're unwitting general public things that are going to a private school.
[01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:44.320]  It's on advertises as Islamic training center with Caliphate law, but it is.
[01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:51.320]  But first, I want to get to a few more of these clips from Obama and the town hall with Anderson Cooper late last week.
[01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:57.320]  What Kelly said, how would government confiscate 350 million guns in America?
[01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:59.320]  You do it incrementally.
[01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:01.320]  You persecute gun owners.
[01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:02.320]  You go after them.
[01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:05.320]  You scare most people into submitting and turning them in.
[01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:10.320]  And that's what CNN did at op-ed piece on Thursday that we wrote about.
[01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:12.320]  In fact, I'll pull it up right now.
[01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:16.320]  I've got it actually punched up.
[01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:23.320]  CNN calls for Obama to declare national state of emergency to gut the second amendment.
[01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:33.320]  Then we link to the actual article in the story, which is titled and written by a Elliott Feynman,
[01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:37.320]  Victim's father, Obama's gun actions won't make a dent.
[01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:39.320]  They just say just confiscate them.
[01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:43.320]  And more and more, that's what Diane Feinstein and others are basically saying.
[01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:49.320]  Let's go to Mark Kelly, how would government confiscate 350 million guns CNN?
[01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:55.320]  Often what you hear in the debate of expanding background checks to more gun sales and as you know,
[01:01:55.320 --> 01:02:02.320]  Gabby and I are 100% behind the concept of somebody getting a background check before buying a gun.
[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:09.320]  But when we testified in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, we heard not only from the gun lobby,
[01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:17.320]  but from United States senators that expanding background checks will not may, will lead to a registry,
[01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:21.320]  which will lead to confiscation, which will lead to a tyrannical government.
[01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:23.320]  Has everywhere else?
[01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:31.320]  So I would like you to explain with 350 million guns in 65 million places.
[01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:33.320]  He's wearing the obvious ring right there.
[01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:34.320]  From Key West.
[01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:36.320]  Obama's wearing the radical Muslim ring.
[01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:40.320]  350 million objects in 65 million places.
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:44.320]  The federal government wanted to confiscate those objects.
[01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:46.320]  How would they do that?
[01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:49.320]  What I think Mark is alluding to is what I said earlier.
[01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:57.320]  This notion of a conspiracy out there and it is wrapped up in concerns about the federal government.
[01:02:57.320 --> 01:02:59.320]  Now, there's a long history of that.
[01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:01.320]  That's in our DNA.
[01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:07.320]  The United States was born suspicious of some distant authority.
[01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:09.320]  Distant power.
[01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:10.320]  He goes on.
[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:11.320]  Oh, some distant power.
[01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:13.320]  We played the clip of him at a university.
[01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:14.320]  There's one at West Point too.
[01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:16.320]  Like, don't be scared of some tyranny.
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:17.320]  It's crazy.
[01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:18.320]  There's no tyranny.
[01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:20.320]  Really?
[01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:23.320]  Hitler, Stalin, Mao.
[01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:27.320]  I mean, what are you talking about?
[01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:29.320]  What are you talking about?
[01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:32.320]  There's 200 plus countries in the world.
[01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:35.320]  Like, 209 or something.
[01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:42.320]  And there's like five or six where there's some gun ownership.
[01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:46.320]  And you look at it so you say, nobody wants your guns.
[01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:50.320]  Let's go out to break with Donald Trump and his response saying,
[01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:52.320]  eliminate gun free zones in schools.
[01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:53.320]  Here you go.
[01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:55.320]  What a gun free zone is to a sicko.
[01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:56.320]  That's bait.
[01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:58.320]  That's like gun free zone.
[01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:01.320]  And then they walk in with whatever the hell they're carrying.
[01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:03.320]  And these five great soldiers.
[01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:07.320]  And I'm telling you, one of them was one of the most highly awarded.
[01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:09.320]  He was super shot.
[01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:12.320]  He's not allowed to have a gun.
[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:15.320]  All five are killed instantaneously.
[01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:16.320]  And you have other cases.
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:20.320]  I will get rid of gun free zones on schools.
[01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:22.320]  And you have to.
[01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:27.320]  And on military bases, my first day, it gets signed.
[01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:28.320]  Okay.
[01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:29.320]  My first day.
[01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:34.320]  There's no more gun free zones.
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:40.320]  I mean, think of it.
[01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:42.320]  A gun free zone.
[01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:46.320]  A gun free zone on a military base with some of the best soldiers we have,
[01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:50.320]  sitting there, relaxing, watching television.
[01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:51.320]  No gun.
[01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:53.320]  Guy walks in, kills all of them.
[01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:54.320]  Okay.
[01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:58.320]  That ends immediately.
[01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:28.320]  Disorder, which the American Psychiatric Association describes
[01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:33.320]  as a defiant, disobedient, and hostile behavior toward authority.
[01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:38.320]  Other measures will allow doctors to report patients to the FBI
[01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:41.320]  and RFID tracking with smart guns.
[01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:43.320]  We're going to boost gun safety technology.
[01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:46.320]  We need to develop new technologies that make guns safer.
[01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:50.320]  We can set it up so you can't unlock your phone
[01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:52.320]  unless you've got the right fingerprint.
[01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:54.320]  Why can't we do the same thing for our guns?
[01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:27.320]  Now, I want to get into Donald Trump soaring in national polls,
[01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:29.320]  beating Hillary Clinton handily.
[01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:31.320]  I want to go over the numbers for you.
[01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:35.320]  At first, we've got an investigation that's taken us months,
[01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:38.320]  and this is just the first part of the investigation,
[01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:41.320]  with David Knight, Joe Beggs, and others,
[01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:45.320]  into this gulon network that's gotten total billions of dollars,
[01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:48.320]  tens of millions, hundreds of millions a year.
[01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:53.320]  The group's worth more than $25 billion,
[01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:57.320]  and it's connected to all these radical groups.
[01:06:57.320 --> 01:07:01.320]  They promote a caliphate.
[01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:04.320]  They promote Syria law.
[01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:09.320]  And we were already on this last year before there were indictments
[01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:12.320]  made in the United States that the leader of it
[01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:18.320]  who lives here in the U.S. is not shown up to.
[01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:20.320]  And now we have connections to Hillary Clinton
[01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:26.320]  being funded by the very group who makes contributions
[01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:29.320]  for Tula Gulon, the leader of it.
[01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:32.320]  Turkish Eman's U.S.A. Network of Schools to be investigated
[01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:35.320]  as part of lawsuit, that started back on December 14th.
[01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:37.320]  Since then, there were criminal charges,
[01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:39.320]  and no one showed up to the events.
[01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:42.320]  Now, the point in getting into all this,
[01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:45.320]  I'm not even saying this group's the end all be all of evil.
[01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:47.320]  I'm not saying they're out to even get us.
[01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:52.320]  I'm saying I can show you New York Daily News and CBS News
[01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:54.320]  where aircraft are flying into the U.S.
[01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:58.320]  where hundreds of people get off from all over the world,
[01:07:58.320 --> 01:08:03.320]  and they don't even check their visas or their passports
[01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:05.320]  because they're from Latin America or they're from Asia
[01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:08.320]  or they're from Europe or they're from Syria.
[01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:11.320]  But then when I fly, they want to grope me and my family
[01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:13.320]  to train me to be a slave.
[01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:16.320]  It's all a joke.
[01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:19.320]  And it just illustrates how this war on terror
[01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:21.320]  is a way to take our freedoms.
[01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:23.320]  Now they say ISIS has U.S. made stingers.
[01:08:23.320 --> 01:08:25.320]  Well, that happened in Benghazi.
[01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:28.320]  But the media, the London Independent says
[01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:31.320]  they made the missiles themselves in the headline,
[01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:34.320]  but then later admit, no, they got them from the U.S.
[01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:37.320]  You mean the criminals that run the U.S.?
[01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:39.320]  And then we come back from this report.
[01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:43.320]  I'm going to get into the thousand-plus men
[01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:46.320]  reportedly out molesting and raping women in Cologne.
[01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:48.320]  The police chief has been fired.
[01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:49.320]  The mayor is in trouble.
[01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:51.320]  But Merkel's on record.
[01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:53.320]  We have a video clip saying, let them engage in crime.
[01:08:53.320 --> 01:08:54.320]  You deserve it, basically.
[01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:57.320]  This is the leftist bizarre death wish.
[01:08:57.320 --> 01:08:58.320]  That's all coming up.
[01:08:58.320 --> 01:09:02.320]  But first, here is the report with Joe Biggs and others
[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:05.320]  into your tax money paying for schools.
[01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:08.320]  We're going to back it up.
[01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:14.320]  Your taxpayer money paying for schools.
[01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:15.320]  Think about this.
[01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:17.320]  They actually teach Sharia law,
[01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:20.320]  but look like normal private schools
[01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:23.320]  to accelerate your kids' learning all over the U.S.
[01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:26.320]  and almost all the teachers are brought in far.
[01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:28.320]  This is just an example of how wide open we are.
[01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:29.320]  Here it is.
[01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:31.320]  This is Joe Biggs with infowars.com.
[01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:34.320]  Now we have covered countless terror attacks.
[01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:36.320]  But where do these attacks start?
[01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:38.320]  And what leads to them?
[01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:41.320]  Multiple attacks have erupted in Paris tonight.
[01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:44.320]  More than 120 people have been killed in Paris.
[01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:47.320]  And more than 200 are injured in a series of attacks
[01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:49.320]  across the city.
[01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:50.320]  After the attacks in Paris,
[01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:52.320]  we began a trek across the country
[01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:55.320]  investigating the American Caliphate.
[01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:58.320]  We went deep into the Catskill Mountains
[01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:00.320]  and investigated Islamberg,
[01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:03.320]  an area started by Mumbark Ali Jalani,
[01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:06.320]  the leader of the Alfucra terrorist organization.
[01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:10.320]  We then made our way to Dearborn and Hamtramik, Michigan,
[01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:13.320]  small suburbs surrounding the Detroit area
[01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:15.320]  that are predominantly Muslim.
[01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:19.320]  Then the attacks in San Bernardino, California unfolded.
[01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:21.320]  While investigating San Bernardino,
[01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:24.320]  David Knight spoke with the director of Killing Ed,
[01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:27.320]  a documentary exposing charter schools throughout the world
[01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:31.320]  that are led by a man named Fatela Galen.
[01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:34.320]  This was essentially a documentary that was about charter schools.
[01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:37.320]  They found that the largest charter school at the time,
[01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:39.320]  the schools being run by Fatela Galen,
[01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:43.320]  was also the worst case example, according to whistleblowers,
[01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:46.320]  as to what could go wrong with charter schools.
[01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:49.320]  This whole organization and these schools that masquerade
[01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:54.320]  as schools of science and math are really about pushing Turkey.
[01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:56.320]  And we need to ask ourselves,
[01:10:56.320 --> 01:10:59.320]  why are they proselytizing so hard about Turkey?
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:02.320]  Of course, they can't directly proselytize about Islam
[01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:05.320]  because then they would lose all their federal funding,
[01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:09.320]  but they do proselytize very hard with Turkey.
[01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:13.320]  Galen is living in a self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania
[01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:17.320]  due to what he says were for health concerns.
[01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:19.320]  Now, what we've heard is that this man
[01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:22.320]  was allegedly given a visa from the CIA.
[01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:25.320]  Many say Galen is a front for the CIA.
[01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:29.320]  Classified documents obtained by WikiLeaks reveal
[01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:33.320]  secularists are convinced that the Justice and Development Party
[01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:36.320]  is the creation of the US government
[01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:39.320]  and that Washington funds the Galen movement.
[01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:42.320]  Fatela Galen is a Turkish imam
[01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:45.320]  who is under investigation by the Turkish government.
[01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:48.320]  He wants to impose Sharia law on Turkey
[01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:51.320]  and eventually the rest of the world.
[01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:54.320]  He is also being sued by Robert Amsterdam
[01:11:54.320 --> 01:12:00.320]  the founding partner of London-based Amsterdam and Partners LLP.
[01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:02.320]  They were hired by the Turkish government
[01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:05.320]  to expose allegedly unlawful conduct
[01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:08.320]  by the Galen network worldwide.
[01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:12.320]  Our investigation led us to the Cosmos Foundation,
[01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:16.320]  which is an umbrella group for a vast network of charter schools
[01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:19.320]  which is used to recruit young, impressionable minds
[01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:22.320]  to accept the ruling law of Sharia.
[01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:26.320]  Now, 46 campuses are spread throughout Texas,
[01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:29.320]  with the headquarters being located in Houston.
[01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:32.320]  There are six Galen schools in Austin alone
[01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:37.320]  and over 130 charter locations around the United States.
[01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:42.320]  The Galen-inspired schools are the largest charter network in the US
[01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:48.320]  and they receive approximately 150 million a year in taxpayer money.
[01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:51.320]  The majority of the teachers come from Turkey
[01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:57.320]  and a majority of the contracts for construction go to Turkish businesses.
[01:12:57.320 --> 01:13:02.320]  These actions alone should raise a red flag to the American public.
[01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:05.320]  Back on December 22nd of this year,
[01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:09.320]  Fatula Galen was a no-show at his first trial in Turkey.
[01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:12.320]  Galen faces terrorism charges for being the leader
[01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:17.320]  of the Fatulis terrorist organization, also known as FETO,
[01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:20.320]  and is accused of plotting to imprison his critics
[01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:23.320]  despite his repeated claims of innocence.
[01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:27.320]  Now an arrest warrant has been issued for 61 suspects
[01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:32.320]  and Galen himself for their reported involvement in the terrorist organization.
[01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:35.320]  So why do we have a man protected by the CIA
[01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:41.320]  that we know funnels millions of US taxpayer dollars to his movement in Turkey,
[01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:44.320]  running the largest amount of charter schools in America,
[01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:48.320]  but we as American citizens have our rights trampled upon by the TSA
[01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:50.320]  and our borders left wide open.
[01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:54.320]  We know that the Obama administration funds and arms ISIS
[01:13:54.320 --> 01:14:00.320]  and yet our Second Amendment rights are attacked every time a tragedy strikes our country.
[01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:04.320]  Now our government wants to bring in unvetted Syrian refugees
[01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:08.320]  that come from war-torn areas and are brought up with anti-American values
[01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:12.320]  and also use fake passports to infiltrate refugee groups
[01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:16.320]  to get into our country and eventually carry out attacks.
[01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:20.320]  America needs to wake up. The time is now.
[01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:23.320]  Spread this video worldwide.
[01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:26.320]  People need to understand what is going on.
[01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:32.320]  Now this will only be the first part in a larger series of investigations
[01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:35.320]  looking into the Galan movement and what it means
[01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:39.320]  and what its future could possibly be here in America.
[01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:43.320]  This is Joe Biggs reporting from the front lines of the Info War.
[01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:47.320]  We just premiered that report that has never aired.
[01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:49.320]  That normally would air on the nightly news,
[01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:53.320]  but we're airing it here today on the Sunday Radio Broadcast
[01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:57.320]  4 to 6 p.m. Central Standard Time.
[01:14:57.320 --> 01:15:03.320]  And this is mainstream news that our government is funding
[01:15:03.320 --> 01:15:05.320]  these radical Islamic groups.
[01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:07.320]  And again, folks, I don't want a class of civilizations.
[01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:10.320]  I'm not anti-Islamic, period.
[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:17.320]  But radical organizations are being funded to take over the Middle East,
[01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:19.320]  to basically sabotage the Middle East,
[01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:24.320]  but also use that threat to take American liberties and freedoms.
[01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:26.320]  And now you see them doing it saying,
[01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:28.320]  we have to take your liberties away.
[01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:30.320]  We have to take your freedoms away because the refugees
[01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:32.320]  have a bunch of terrorists in them.
[01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:34.320]  But who brought them in? The government.
[01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:38.320]  And who started the war to destabilize Syria, Egypt, Libya,
[01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:42.320]  and other countries, the people that have hijacked and run our country.
[01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:44.320]  Now when we come back, we're going to look at Germany,
[01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:46.320]  France, and other European countries,
[01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:49.320]  where they've got hundreds of rapes being reported a day.
[01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:51.320]  I mean, this is crazy.
[01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:54.320]  We'll explain why the government is covering that up
[01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:56.320]  by the radical Jihadis.
[01:15:57.320 --> 01:15:59.320]  It has happened.
[01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:02.320]  2015 has passed into history, into lore.
[01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:06.320]  But now, 2016 has been born,
[01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:10.320]  and the decision lies in your hands to forge the destiny.
[01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:12.320]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:15.320]  That's a little too epic, that Hollywood action adventure,
[01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:17.320]  science fiction voice I'm using.
[01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:20.320]  But quite frankly, that's how I feel like I should be talking
[01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:23.320]  about what happens when your body actually gets the real
[01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:25.320]  natural nutrients it needs.
[01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:28.320]  And that's why we're offering the biggest discount ever

[01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:52.320]  And see, I just did it again.
[01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:55.320]  I can't help but get excited, get healthy, fight the globalists,
[01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:57.320]  win-win, yeah!
[01:16:57.320 --> 01:16:59.320]  I want more candy. I want more video games.
[01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:02.320]  Why, why, why? And it's that type of behavior
[01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:05.320]  that spurred me to do the research to develop a true
[01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:08.320]  nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out
[01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:10.320]  and help children focus.
[01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:13.320]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:16.320]  Television music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:19.320]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system
[01:17:19.320 --> 01:17:22.320]  and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:25.320]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down
[01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:28.320]  and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:31.320]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula
[01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:34.320]  with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:37.320]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements
[01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:40.320]  that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable
[01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:42.320]  and powerful calming formula out there.
[01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:45.320]  Introducing Child Ease with herbs and calming extracts
[01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:48.320]  like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients
[01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:50.320]  that taste great.

[01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:57.320]  888-253-3139
[01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:27.320]  By the way, I know entertainment is just entertainment
[01:20:27.320 --> 01:20:29.320]  but so much of culture is governed by it.
[01:20:29.320 --> 01:20:31.320]  And I went off reviews.
[01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:33.320]  I went off people that I'd talked to
[01:20:33.320 --> 01:20:38.320]  to say that the New Star Wars was absolutely horrible.
[01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:40.320]  And of course we had the spoilers.
[01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:43.320]  But I watched it and it was pretty good, I actually thought.
[01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:47.320]  I mean, Princess Leia was absolutely like Hillary Clinton
[01:20:47.320 --> 01:20:49.320]  bossing people around and bitching on Han Solo.
[01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:52.320]  But Han Solo gets killed like Obi-Wan Kenobi.
[01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:54.320]  That's how episode four starts.
[01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:57.320]  So it's not as good as an episode four or five
[01:20:57.320 --> 01:21:00.320]  but it's a lot better than an episode one
[01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:04.320]  or an episode, let me see, four, five, zero, six.
[01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:05.320]  Return of the Jedi.
[01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:07.320]  So I think it's a pretty good movie, actually.
[01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:09.320]  I rarely have to correct myself
[01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:13.320]  but I've got to say it's better than mediocre.
[01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:14.320]  Very entertaining.
[01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:15.320]  It was a good movie.
[01:21:15.320 --> 01:21:17.320]  It just wasn't deep.
[01:21:17.320 --> 01:21:18.320]  But it was entertaining.
[01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:22.320]  So I stand corrected and I told folks I hadn't seen it yet.
[01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:25.320]  I was just going off the transcript and off the spoilers.
[01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:28.320]  But here I am and of course I got reminded of that
[01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:29.320]  because I saw it about a week ago.
[01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:32.320]  Nico finally saw it, the main producer of the show.
[01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:34.320]  And he said, I thought it was pretty good.
[01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:37.320]  And I had been meaning to come in
[01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:40.320]  and actually do that Mia Copa and just say,
[01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:42.320]  okay, I was wrong.
[01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:44.320]  It was not as bad as say episode one.
[01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:46.320]  It's like three times better than episode one.
[01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:48.320]  But episode one is really bad.
[01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:50.320]  I mean, it's a really bad movie.
[01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:51.320]  So there you go.
[01:21:51.320 --> 01:21:54.320]  Disney has done better than George Lucas did in the last few years.
[01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:55.320]  Hate to say it.
[01:21:55.320 --> 01:21:57.320]  They'll say I've sold out to Disney.
[01:21:57.320 --> 01:21:59.320]  I just have sold out to the truth.
[01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:01.320]  And so I have to say the truth even if I don't like it.
[01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:03.320]  Even if it makes me wrong.
[01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:05.320]  So I agree with Obama now too.
[01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:07.320]  Raising the debt doesn't raise the debt
[01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:08.320]  and nobody wants your guns.
[01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:09.320]  They're not coming for them.
[01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:11.320]  No, no, I'm joking folks.
[01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:12.320]  We know that.
[01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:13.320]  We understand.
[01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:14.320]  We've seen this movie.
[01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:16.320]  We can give you a review.
[01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:18.320]  Now, speaking of seeing this movie,
[01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:20.320]  there are a bunch of Muslim countries
[01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:22.320]  that have some of the lowest crime rates in the world
[01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:24.320]  that are very nice people
[01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:26.320]  and are high level of education
[01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:28.320]  and make good, good immigrants.
[01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:30.320]  Places like Syria
[01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:33.320]  or Iraq before the wars.
[01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:35.320]  Not anymore folks.
[01:22:35.320 --> 01:22:38.320]  And the West has funded all these radicals to come in
[01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:40.320]  and take over.
[01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:42.320]  But because the Russians and others have kicked them out,
[01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:45.320]  they've run to Turkey, which borders Europe.
[01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:48.320]  Now, that was the big western country they got taken over
[01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:50.320]  when Constantinople fell to the Muslims
[01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:53.320]  and became Istanbul.
[01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:55.320]  That's Turkey's working with the radicals,
[01:22:55.320 --> 01:22:57.320]  brings them in.
[01:22:57.320 --> 01:22:59.320]  And then in Muslim culture in the radical countries,
[01:22:59.320 --> 01:23:01.320]  it's not an all Muslim culture,
[01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:03.320]  but in the Saudi Arabian culture and others
[01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:06.320]  that claim to the core fundamentalist Muslims,
[01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:10.320]  a woman unattended wearing a beekeeper suit
[01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:12.320]  to close stuff on Malinu,
[01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:14.320]  wearing a headdress fully covered,
[01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:16.320]  what they call it, burqa.
[01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:18.320]  They can be raped and then when they're raped,
[01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:20.320]  they can be beaten or executed
[01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:22.320]  because it's their fault.
[01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:24.320]  Just to be out without a man
[01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:26.320]  leading you by the hand in your beekeeper suit.
[01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:28.320]  You're not even beekeeping.
[01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:30.320]  Oh, I'm being against the culture. Yes.
[01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:32.320]  It's a culture that says we're going to take over
[01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:35.320]  and make your wife or daughters wear a beekeeper suit.
[01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:37.320]  No, you're not.
[01:23:37.320 --> 01:23:39.320]  I got a second amendment.
[01:23:39.320 --> 01:23:41.320]  Go to Hades.
[01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:43.320]  Now, that said,
[01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:46.320]  they bring in millions the last few years.
[01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:48.320]  I mean, it's like five million the last four years.
[01:23:48.320 --> 01:23:51.320]  It's a million and a half just in Germany last year.
[01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:53.320]  It is crazy numbers.
[01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:57.320]  No passports, no IDs just like Obama's doing.
[01:23:57.320 --> 01:23:59.320]  And then they go out and party at night.
[01:23:59.320 --> 01:24:01.320]  Most of our military aged men,
[01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:03.320]  a lot of them were smuggled in,
[01:24:03.320 --> 01:24:05.320]  promised all this free sex.
[01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:07.320]  They told them the Germans are all a bunch of crazy sluts
[01:24:07.320 --> 01:24:09.320]  and they watch Western television.
[01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:11.320]  They believe it.
[01:24:11.320 --> 01:24:13.320]  They don't get you up to ignore the women
[01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:15.320]  to get them back like that.
[01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:17.320]  You don't run up and try to rape them.
[01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:19.320]  Kind of tell them they're ugly to get them to do that,
[01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:21.320]  not rape them, dummies.
[01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:23.320]  Anyways, the point is,
[01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:25.320]  just haven't figured it out yet,
[01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:27.320]  they're going to have them raping you
[01:24:27.320 --> 01:24:29.320]  if you've figured out to become a pickup artist.
[01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:31.320]  It's not an issue.
[01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:33.320]  But imagine third world populations
[01:24:33.320 --> 01:24:35.320]  running up to do all this
[01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:37.320]  and then this happened New Year's Eve last week,
[01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:39.320]  the German military, government, government,
[01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:41.320]  all over Germany,
[01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:43.320]  from Frankfurt to Munich to Cologne,
[01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:45.320]  covered it up.
[01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:47.320]  Thousands of men just gang raping,
[01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:49.320]  beating women, breaking their noses.
[01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:53.320]  Let's play some of the video and audio
[01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:55.320]  for radio and TV listeners of the guns being fired,
[01:24:55.320 --> 01:24:57.320]  the fireworks going off.
[01:24:57.320 --> 01:24:59.320]  The police said it was like an invasion.
[01:24:59.320 --> 01:25:05.320]  Here it is.
[01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:07.320]  Of course they have massive gun control there,
[01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:09.320]  but they magically had guns.
[01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:11.320]  Screaming and cussing, give us your women,
[01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:13.320]  I'll lock bar.
[01:25:13.320 --> 01:25:15.320]  Loading their guns, firing them in the air.
[01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:19.320]  If we just had gun control though,
[01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:21.320]  just like Mexico has total gun control,
[01:25:21.320 --> 01:25:23.320]  but super high crime rates.
[01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:29.320]  That's right, just fire your guns in the air.
[01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:31.320]  And they were just in Syria having their fun,
[01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:33.320]  but got kicked out by the Russians.
[01:25:33.320 --> 01:25:35.320]  Chopping heads off, everything else.
[01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:39.320]  And their camp followers just want to have a good time.
[01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:41.320]  He's like, I am liberal.
[01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:49.320]  So this is just, some towns of 100 people
[01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:51.320]  have like 500 people put in there
[01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:53.320]  and they just go, look,
[01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:55.320]  school kids, you belong to them,
[01:25:55.320 --> 01:25:57.320]  make their beds, give them food.
[01:25:57.320 --> 01:25:59.320]  And they actually say, I'm allowed to rape you.
[01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:01.320]  Merkel says.
[01:26:01.320 --> 01:26:03.320]  Shock videos on infowars.com,
[01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:05.320]  migrants in Berlin,
[01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:07.320]  shooting guns, throwing fireworks.
[01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:09.320]  Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:26:09.320 --> 01:26:11.320]  That's one of like 30 articles I have.
[01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:13.320]  Here's another one.
[01:26:13.320 --> 01:26:15.320]  Cologne sex attacks in Germany.
[01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:17.320]  Police chief is sacked over handling of assaults.
[01:26:17.320 --> 01:26:19.320]  Filed reports saying no incidents,
[01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:21.320]  no time, no muggings, no nothing the next day.
[01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:23.320]  Even though it was just giant gang raping
[01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:25.320]  and the police standing down.
[01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:27.320]  They actually did the raping
[01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:29.320]  in front of the police station.
[01:26:29.320 --> 01:26:31.320]  That's funny.
[01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:33.320]  Anyway, it's continuing.
[01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:35.320]  Merkel to back stricter rules for migrants
[01:26:35.320 --> 01:26:37.320]  after cologne attacks.
[01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:39.320]  She now says they'll check their IDs.
[01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:41.320]  They advertise everywhere, just come on in.
[01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:43.320]  Maybe they'll make sure the women
[01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:45.320]  lay on their back and submit properly
[01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:47.320]  because the mayor, the big feminist said,
[01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:49.320]  you shouldn't dress sexy
[01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:51.320]  and you should learn how to fight back
[01:26:51.320 --> 01:26:53.320]  physically, but you can't have guns
[01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:55.320]  to protect yourself.
[01:26:55.320 --> 01:26:57.320]  So that's the news there.
[01:26:57.320 --> 01:26:59.320]  I'll tell you another country that's in
[01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:01.320]  major revolt over
[01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:03.320]  unlimited North Africa
[01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:05.320]  and other Muslims being brought in.
[01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:07.320]  I was in Catalan
[01:27:07.320 --> 01:27:09.320]  about three, four months ago.
[01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:11.320]  I always wanted to go to Spain.
[01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:13.320]  I went to Spain. It was very beautiful.
[01:27:13.320 --> 01:27:15.320]  And I go to the airport
[01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:17.320]  and there are just
[01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:19.320]  streams of Muslims and I was checking their
[01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:21.320]  passports. I saw them ahead of me checking it.
[01:27:21.320 --> 01:27:23.320]  They were all out of Libya.
[01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:25.320]  They were out of Tunis.
[01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:27.320]  They were all these different cities and countries
[01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:29.320]  in North Africa and they were coming
[01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:31.320]  in and they were non-citizens
[01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:33.320]  and they were being ordered to let in.
[01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:35.320]  And I was watching the border police
[01:27:35.320 --> 01:27:37.320]  just angrily stamp their passports
[01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:39.320]  and let them in.
[01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:41.320]  Then they used that to take
[01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:43.320]  this Spanish free speech.
[01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:45.320]  They got it all over with 47%
[01:27:45.320 --> 01:27:47.320]  unemployment for young people under 30.
[01:27:47.320 --> 01:27:49.320]  They used that to take their speech.
[01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:51.320]  And Catalan is somewhat French
[01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:53.320]  quote Spanish, but it's a culture
[01:27:53.320 --> 01:27:55.320]  even older that's Roman influenced.
[01:27:55.320 --> 01:27:57.320]  It's one of the oldest cultures in Spain
[01:27:57.320 --> 01:27:59.320]  when the Romans had bases there.
[01:27:59.320 --> 01:28:01.320]  You see movies like
[01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:03.320]  Gladiator and you're like,
[01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:05.320]  this is like a brown-haired blue-eyed guy
[01:28:05.320 --> 01:28:07.320]  who's supposedly
[01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:09.320]  a Spaniard. Well, that's what Spain was.
[01:28:09.320 --> 01:28:11.320]  Actually out of the Catalan region.
[01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:13.320]  And so they got invaded
[01:28:13.320 --> 01:28:15.320]  by the Muslims.
[01:28:15.320 --> 01:28:17.320]  Most of the country got taken over.
[01:28:17.320 --> 01:28:19.320]  They killed all the men and enslaved most of the women.
[01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:21.320]  That was kind of a blessing
[01:28:21.320 --> 01:28:23.320]  for them to repopulate Spain.
[01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:25.320]  Because they pretty much killed everybody.
[01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:27.320]  They didn't kind of populate, they just murdered everybody
[01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:29.320]  and ran off with the women to Africa.
[01:28:29.320 --> 01:28:31.320]  But now Catalan
[01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:33.320]  separate as back new leader.
[01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:35.320]  They've now seceded by law.
[01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:37.320]  Not with guns, not with any of that.
[01:28:37.320 --> 01:28:39.320]  They just have seceded.
[01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:41.320]  Spain's trying to threaten actions, but they can't.
[01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:43.320]  Because the Catalonians
[01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:45.320]  just refuse to pay taxes.
[01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:47.320]  They're not pulling guns out or wearing camo.
[01:28:47.320 --> 01:28:49.320]  And I'm not against that, but they're just effectively
[01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:51.320]  taking their country back.
[01:28:51.320 --> 01:28:53.320]  And it's got the incredibly corrupt government of Spain
[01:28:53.320 --> 01:28:55.320]  freaking out. We'll cover that more

[01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:06.320]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:33:34.320 --> 01:33:40.400]  This is Alex Jones. This is
[01:33:50.400 --> 01:33:53.400]  football.
[01:33:53.400 --> 01:33:55.520]  This is Alex Jones. This isák
[01:33:55.520 --> 01:33:57.620]  qt.
[01:33:57.620 --> 01:34:00.220]  4 ev produce is
[01:34:00.220 --> 01:34:02.220]  vile pleased to
[01:34:02.220 --> 01:34:07.100]  negative here. There's lots of positive stuff I can tell you, but positive stuff doesn't
[01:34:07.100 --> 01:34:14.740]  need to be attacked or resisted. It can stand on its own. Obamacare, the gun grabs, the
[01:34:14.740 --> 01:34:22.500]  open borders, the paramilitary militarization of our local government. All of this is the
[01:34:22.500 --> 01:34:29.460]  real issues that historically end up being major disasters. Now I want to cover three
[01:34:29.460 --> 01:34:32.340]  things right now. Some of these I've already mentioned, but I'm going to drill deeper
[01:34:32.340 --> 01:34:43.100]  into them. Trump surging into leadership position, not just of the RNC Republican candidates,
[01:34:43.100 --> 01:34:50.260]  but against Hillary and that creature Bernie Sanders. Then a 15 year armed standoff, the
[01:34:50.260 --> 01:34:57.260]  longest in the U.S., maybe world history, ended really last year, but it was announced
[01:34:57.260 --> 01:35:03.220]  yesterday in the Dallas morning news. And then my take on the power ball, the biggest in
[01:35:03.220 --> 01:35:12.260]  history as well. And more on the Catalan separatist, then we'll get into more on Hillary and mainstream
[01:35:12.260 --> 01:35:18.980]  media saying her husband settled rape cases. I was covering that in 97, 98 with Kathleen
[01:35:18.980 --> 01:35:30.500]  Willie and others. Jennifer Flowers, you name it. But now, now it's in the news. Nobody
[01:35:30.500 --> 01:35:35.220]  said he raped Flowers. She was a mistress, but the point is she was in the news. Bill
[01:35:35.220 --> 01:35:39.100]  Clinton, it's a big deal to have that out. It shows you where the system's going, but
[01:35:39.100 --> 01:35:49.340]  getting back to Catalan, Spain has been fascist since World War II, before World War II. And
[01:35:49.340 --> 01:35:55.020]  the king of Spain, Juan Carlos, who was the aid apparent to the dictator of Spain, who
[01:35:55.020 --> 01:36:04.020]  brought back the monarchy, is far from a fascist. I'm not endorsing fascism, but Franco brought
[01:36:04.020 --> 01:36:08.700]  in a type of corporate fascism that's socialist for the general public. And again, they've
[01:36:08.700 --> 01:36:15.100]  got 45, 50% unemployment for young men and women below the age of 30 in Spain. They've
[01:36:15.100 --> 01:36:21.620]  got carbon taxes. They're following the globalist model. It is hellish. And Catalan, it's always
[01:36:21.620 --> 01:36:27.740]  been one of the hardest working, most industrious groups. And it doesn't really identify with
[01:36:27.740 --> 01:36:36.300]  Madrid because it's up in the northeast, bordering the mountains between that and France, is
[01:36:36.300 --> 01:36:40.380]  saying we're not part of this. And they're saying it's not that we don't want to just
[01:36:40.380 --> 01:36:47.380]  be part of Spain. We identify with being part Spanish. It's that Spain is Euro. Spain is
[01:36:47.380 --> 01:36:54.140]  globalist. Spain is corrupt. Spain taxes us at higher rates to the rest of the country
[01:36:54.140 --> 01:36:58.500]  because we're so productive we're done. And I'm telling you, almost every house, almost
[01:36:58.500 --> 01:37:05.020]  every apartment window had a Catalonian flag hanging when I was there last year. And this
[01:37:05.020 --> 01:37:09.460]  is the model. And I'm going to get this in a moment of how to really get out of systems,
[01:37:09.460 --> 01:37:15.260]  how to say no, because I'm all for the Republic. I'm all for America. It's not perfect, but
[01:37:15.260 --> 01:37:18.460]  it's better than other countries. But if it's gone and turned globalist and all this
[01:37:18.460 --> 01:37:25.820]  left the flag, then have Texas and Oklahoma, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, New Mexico
[01:37:25.820 --> 01:37:31.820]  secede. I mean, I believe our governors, our politicians, our citizens can have a better
[01:37:31.820 --> 01:37:36.980]  effect there. I mean, look at Texas has already boomed compared to the rest of the country.
[01:37:36.980 --> 01:37:43.300]  This is because we have a little bit lower taxes. It's already super high. I mean, California's
[01:37:43.300 --> 01:37:48.060]  got like 70% taxes with federal, state and all the rest. I mean, how can anybody, you
[01:37:48.060 --> 01:37:55.640]  make 60, 70 grand a year, you pay like 70% taxes. France is like 87%. If you make a million
[01:37:55.640 --> 01:38:01.260]  euros a year in France, you pay 101% tax. People say, well, that'll bankrupt somebody.
[01:38:01.260 --> 01:38:05.420]  That's the whole plan. Because the big ruling socialist party, it's been in the news for
[01:38:05.420 --> 01:38:11.500]  four years, does not pay taxes and no one enforces. And they go, hold on. You don't pay
[01:38:11.500 --> 01:38:17.860]  tax. He just goes, no comment. Look it up. French elite caught with Swiss bank accounts
[01:38:17.860 --> 01:38:26.420]  not paying taxes. The socialist. See, if other people aren't enforced on with taxes, they're
[01:38:26.420 --> 01:38:30.500]  going to raise them forever. Why not? You're going to go out of business. They won't. They're
[01:38:30.500 --> 01:38:36.980]  going to be able to take over. Catalonia's pro independence parties agreed on Saturday
[01:38:36.980 --> 01:38:41.260]  on a new leader clearing the way for the creation of a regional government and raising pressure
[01:38:41.260 --> 01:38:47.380]  on national parties in Madrid to form a broad coalition to oppose the separatist drive. And
[01:38:47.380 --> 01:38:50.980]  by the way, every other region on their border now is joining. I'm going, we want to leave
[01:38:50.980 --> 01:39:00.580]  you, see how that's infectious. The parties agreed to back Carles Pujamon. If I pronounced
[01:39:00.580 --> 01:39:06.300]  that right, a fiery separatist and a vote due on Sunday came after the region's acting
[01:39:06.300 --> 01:39:11.860]  head, our term moss said he would step down and attempt to break months of political deadlock
[01:39:11.860 --> 01:39:16.340]  in Spain's wealthiest region. And it's the wealthiest region is because they're hard
[01:39:16.340 --> 01:39:20.300]  working folks. I loved them when I was there. I mean, it was just like buzzing around working,
[01:39:20.300 --> 01:39:24.020]  having fun, doing stuff that weren't a bunch of chip on the shoulder, griping young people.
[01:39:24.020 --> 01:39:28.820]  Oh, I got to wait tables. Oh, I got to drive a taxi. Oh, I got to own a hotel. Oh, I got
[01:39:28.820 --> 01:39:34.260]  to do like, why don't you pick up and trendy slacker areas? There's this whole movement
[01:39:34.260 --> 01:39:40.940]  now to text message and to put out on Twitter that you oppose capitalism on your capitalist
[01:39:40.940 --> 01:39:49.620]  slave made phone because a chromatic capitalist system did that. Catalonia's politicians
[01:39:49.620 --> 01:39:53.340]  have been able to form a government since September regional election due to disagreements
[01:39:53.340 --> 01:39:57.260]  between the pro independence parties that together hold a majority in the Barcelona
[01:39:57.260 --> 01:40:02.620]  assembly. You hear that the independence parties hold a majority in the Barcelona assembly.
[01:40:02.620 --> 01:40:06.820]  They've already they started out to get Catalonia free. They already have enough to take over
[01:40:06.820 --> 01:40:13.500]  the whole country. That's how much people want change. Just like Trump ain't perfect.
[01:40:13.500 --> 01:40:16.900]  But he didn't the ruling elite. And if he doesn't do what we want, we'll kick his ass
[01:40:16.900 --> 01:40:25.420]  out. John Boehner's gone. Paul Ryan doesn't do what we want. We'll kick him out. So I'm
[01:40:25.420 --> 01:40:31.820]  done talking about that. I'm going to go to break due to time. And we come back. I'm going
[01:40:31.820 --> 01:40:36.380]  to hit the Trump news, how he's in the lead and all these big polls nationally, not just
[01:40:36.380 --> 01:40:42.900]  of the Republican heat. It's his to walk away with his to lose. And then a 15 year armed
[01:40:42.900 --> 01:40:47.820]  standoff quietly ends. No, I'm not talking about the new 15 year armed standoff out with
[01:40:47.820 --> 01:40:52.820]  the bunnies out in Oregon that I've been critical of, you know, how they're doing. And I'm not
[01:40:52.820 --> 01:40:56.740]  against them. I just have some points to make. And they're like, how dare you? You must salute
[01:40:56.740 --> 01:41:01.100]  everything we do here bad. Not the bunnies, but they're militia people, the commandos
[01:41:01.100 --> 01:41:06.060]  that we've learned about their military service or lack of, we're going to be covering soon.
[01:41:06.060 --> 01:41:12.860]  But I want to just dovetail what Catalonia has done. Moving towards taking their country
[01:41:12.860 --> 01:41:16.740]  back with the Texas governor's doing saying, we're not going to play ball with all this.
[01:41:16.740 --> 01:41:20.900]  We're going to veto your gun grabs, all these sheriffs saying all these police chiefs saying
[01:41:20.900 --> 01:41:25.700]  we're not going to go along with gun confiscation moves to have the states aligned and basically
[01:41:25.700 --> 01:41:30.460]  point out the federal government's been dissolved, which the states can do under con con and reestablish
[01:41:30.460 --> 01:41:34.820]  the federal government. The states can impeach Obama. So that's all coming up. This is big
[01:41:34.820 --> 01:41:42.340]  news. But before I do that, one plug here on the show, we were going to end it Friday.

[01:47:02.260 --> 01:47:17.700]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show. We are on the march. The empire is on the run.
[01:47:17.700 --> 01:47:27.780]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. I had a couple hundred squats and dead lifts
[01:47:27.780 --> 01:47:33.420]  yesterday. I'm glad to have my legs sore. Three hundred push-ups. It's not that much
[01:47:33.420 --> 01:47:36.700]  for some people, but it's a lot for me. We're talking about an hour and a half. But you
[01:47:36.700 --> 01:47:42.900]  know what? The good news is that pain was actually enjoyable compared to being a jellyfish.
[01:47:42.900 --> 01:47:46.940]  And that's really the name of the game. If we don't get politically active, politically
[01:47:46.940 --> 01:47:53.340]  informed, politically involved, we'll be slaves. We turn our lives over to other people. And
[01:47:53.340 --> 01:47:58.380]  all I'm trying to do is illustrate to people how we're being screwed over. You don't have
[01:47:58.380 --> 01:48:04.140]  to have my perspective or even see things the way I do. But you can think for yourself
[01:48:04.140 --> 01:48:08.420]  and realize you're being lied to by the mainstream media. So let me go back over some of these
[01:48:08.420 --> 01:48:12.140]  stories and hit some of the ones I haven't gotten to yet here in closing. And then I'll
[01:48:12.140 --> 01:48:16.180]  be back tomorrow at 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. with the weekday transmission. I'm very honored
[01:48:16.180 --> 01:48:22.220]  and thankful that you've joined us today. Economist GOP may win 47 states in general
[01:48:22.220 --> 01:48:30.020]  election. That is the hill. Supply side economist Arthur Laffer is predicting Republicans will
[01:48:30.020 --> 01:48:35.780]  win the White House in a landslide this year, regardless of the nominee. I'd be surprised
[01:48:35.780 --> 01:48:44.300]  if Republicans don't take 45, 56, 57 states out of the 50 Laffer told the Cats Roundtable
[01:48:44.300 --> 01:48:50.540]  on New York's a.m. 970 Sunday. I mean, I think it's going to be a landslide and that's what
[01:48:50.540 --> 01:48:54.820]  the evidence shows. He's made a lot of accurate predictions before that's in the Hill newspaper.
[01:48:54.820 --> 01:49:00.140]  Now, here's one in the U.S. News and World Report a lot more scientific than his opinion.
[01:49:00.140 --> 01:49:06.100]  Trump could win it all. A new survey shows a sizable number of Democrats ready to defect
[01:49:06.100 --> 01:49:14.700]  from Hillary Clinton to Donald Trump. 20% in a Washington based Mercury analytics combination
[01:49:14.700 --> 01:49:21.780]  dial test of Trump's first big campaign among 916 self-proclaimed likely voters who consider
[01:49:21.780 --> 01:49:27.820]  themselves to be on the fence. 20% of Democrats said they would be voting for Donald Trump.
[01:49:27.820 --> 01:49:33.860]  I think it's 10% he wins, folks, the Democrats shot poll. Here it is. 20% of likely Democrat
[01:49:33.860 --> 01:49:39.660]  voters to cross over to Trump. American Mirror. There's a Breitbart article poll. Trump beats
[01:49:39.660 --> 01:49:46.540]  Hillary in general election matchup. Fox News poll. Vester Stallone comes out and says quote
[01:49:46.540 --> 01:49:53.100]  I love Trump. I didn't jump on the bandwagon for Obama and I'm not jumping on the Donald
[01:49:53.100 --> 01:49:58.660]  Trump bandwagon, but at least he says he doesn't want to confiscate the guns. I don't like
[01:49:58.660 --> 01:50:02.860]  some of his comments about I'm really militaristic. Don't worry. I'm not a wimp, but I don't want
[01:50:02.860 --> 01:50:07.900]  to attack Russia or attack Iran. I mean, he says basically I don't want war, but don't
[01:50:07.900 --> 01:50:14.100]  worry. I'm tough. So I kind of buy into the rhetoric. Still, I know Hillary wants to go
[01:50:14.100 --> 01:50:18.940]  attack countries like Egypt, Syria, Libya that didn't attack us and then put horrible
[01:50:18.940 --> 01:50:25.020]  people in show. Again, I know she's 10 times worse. I mean, let's just say Trump's bad.
[01:50:25.020 --> 01:50:31.300]  He's not Hillary. And the whole establishment is against him. That's why I've been the last
[01:50:31.300 --> 01:50:37.860]  month or two saying, Hey, I love Iran poll. I love Ted Cruz. They're just on the polls.
[01:50:37.860 --> 01:50:45.980]  Like a Donald Trump. It's just a fact. I've known Rand Paul 20 years. He just did in the
[01:50:45.980 --> 01:50:50.940]  position and you got to dance with the horses in the lead. If you're not going to support
[01:50:50.940 --> 01:50:55.980]  the other horses. Now let's get to this story and I'm going to roll some footage for TV
[01:50:55.980 --> 01:51:01.140]  viewers. If they just, you know, tune in the last few years and know this. It was in the
[01:51:01.140 --> 01:51:05.660]  late nineties and I got calls on my radio show and there was no attention to it in the
[01:51:05.660 --> 01:51:10.740]  news. It wasn't even in the Dallas morning news yet. It wasn't on national news and
[01:51:10.740 --> 01:51:14.620]  the Gray family called me and they said, we listen to your show every night. We need
[01:51:14.620 --> 01:51:20.860]  your help, Alex. My dad got arrested. It was his son calling and he called in and I'm going
[01:51:20.860 --> 01:51:25.060]  back 17, 18 years. It's hard to remember at all, but there's articles about it, videos
[01:51:25.060 --> 01:51:29.860]  about it. And they said he, they pulled us over with a legal gun, took him to jail. They're
[01:51:29.860 --> 01:51:33.860]  charging him. We're having an armed standoff. They said they're going to rate us the next
[01:51:33.860 --> 01:51:39.860]  week. So I go out there and we find DPS cameras hidden and cattle trailers with SWAT teams
[01:51:39.860 --> 01:51:44.140]  ready to come in and I go in the night. They're supposed to come in and, you know, all the
[01:51:44.140 --> 01:51:48.980]  rest of this happens. And then Chuck Norris hears about it and he lands by helicopter
[01:51:48.980 --> 01:51:54.740]  to try to go in and talk them out. Well, 15 years after it started, it really started
[01:51:54.740 --> 01:51:58.620]  before that, but it became a big national story. It started about 16 years ago, about
[01:51:58.620 --> 01:52:09.020]  99. They send in the quote militia. He's never been in the military. Same story out in Oregon.
[01:52:09.020 --> 01:52:13.540]  You know, we're talking the stolen valor, valor story. And they show up and go, Alex
[01:52:13.540 --> 01:52:21.020]  Jones is a Fed and gave out the intel on you. And then of course a man like John Joe Gray
[01:52:21.020 --> 01:52:25.900]  or whoever else, while there's guys around me in military uniforms telling me I'm the
[01:52:25.900 --> 01:52:30.940]  leader. That's right, man. I salute you. Of course, it's feds all around them or opposition
[01:52:30.940 --> 01:52:36.220]  that's controlled to make it look stupid. But the sheriff and others were smart. Didn't
[01:52:36.220 --> 01:52:43.380]  want a new Waco. It's real close to Waco and they didn't go in for 15 years. And now they've
[01:52:43.380 --> 01:52:49.380]  dropped the charges and it's in the Dallas morning news. It's in a bunch of other newspapers,
[01:52:49.380 --> 01:52:55.220]  Daily Mail, longest armed standoff in American history ends, grandfather who bit a cop. That
[01:52:55.220 --> 01:52:59.900]  actually tackled him, then threatened to kill any officer who came to arrest him as charges
[01:52:59.900 --> 01:53:04.460]  dropped it for 16 years, meaning it's free to leave his home for the first time since
[01:53:04.460 --> 01:53:10.620]  99. And I don't think the graves will probably leave their 40 something acres regardless.
[01:53:10.620 --> 01:53:14.540]  And man, I've lived this over and over again. I think they're good people. I think they
[01:53:14.540 --> 01:53:20.220]  were misguided. They were manipulated. But man, same deal. I send Joe Biggs out to Oregon
[01:53:20.220 --> 01:53:24.340]  where the Bundy's are. I said, David Knight and others out there last year said they did
[01:53:24.340 --> 01:53:28.260]  the right thing standing up at the feds and taking their cattle on their own grazing rights.
[01:53:28.260 --> 01:53:32.020]  They went back to take the cattle with protesters. The feds said, we're going to shoot you. They
[01:53:32.020 --> 01:53:37.980]  had to back off. We have HD video of that in historic footage feds surrendered to citizens
[01:53:37.980 --> 01:53:42.260]  because they were in the right there. You go take some wildlife refuge building over.
[01:53:42.260 --> 01:53:46.180]  Say you're going to be there and then there's tweets about we need snacks. We need supplies
[01:53:46.180 --> 01:53:49.900]  because they're not ready. And then Joe Biggs goes in there and almost all these militia
[01:53:49.900 --> 01:53:55.380]  guys aren't even former military. Some say they are. We're going to report on it. And
[01:53:55.380 --> 01:54:01.420]  they immediately go, Alex Jones ain't welcome. He says we're feds. Never said that. I said,
[01:54:01.420 --> 01:54:05.840]  look out for feds trying to provocateur violence. So it's the same story. We put the graves
[01:54:05.840 --> 01:54:11.220]  on the map. We show what's happening. We stopped the arm takeover. People show up in uniforms
[01:54:11.220 --> 01:54:17.500]  and go, he's a fed. And they go, that's right. We salute that. And it's the same story. So
[01:54:17.500 --> 01:54:21.980]  I don't think the feds are going to move in on the bundies. And I think they've now got
[01:54:21.980 --> 01:54:26.300]  their new 15 year house. I mean, I mean, I hope that's what happens rather than a big
[01:54:26.300 --> 01:54:31.580]  shootout and Obama gets his new false flag and start a war against gun owners. And I
[01:54:31.580 --> 01:54:37.780]  get the feds are grabbing property. I get their tyrannical. I get they, but the Hammons themselves
[01:54:37.780 --> 01:54:40.820]  that the, that the bundies say they're helping. And I think the bundies are feds. I think
[01:54:40.820 --> 01:54:47.380]  they're misguided. They don't want this going on. And it's a federal building. It's not
[01:54:47.380 --> 01:54:54.140]  their own cows grabbed by the feds on grazing rights they had since 1878. That's why even,
[01:54:54.140 --> 01:55:00.900]  you know, the older Bundy, you know, was saying, you know, he's not getting involved in this.
[01:55:00.900 --> 01:55:04.500]  It's just a big national story to say, I saw the scene in a headline like an hour ago during
[01:55:04.500 --> 01:55:10.900]  a break gunman, more gunman arrive. And you know, we have this headline here. Idaho militia
[01:55:10.900 --> 01:55:18.140]  groups arrives a secure perimeter from the evil Patriot media prevent Waco style situation
[01:55:18.140 --> 01:55:22.940]  in Oregon refuge. But I'll tell you the good news about all this. And I do respect the courage.
[01:55:22.940 --> 01:55:28.940]  People like the bundies. It does show the feds aren't ready for a toe to toe fight with
[01:55:28.940 --> 01:55:35.020]  the American people. They try mass gun confiscation. They try mass arrest. They try to declare
[01:55:35.020 --> 01:55:41.820]  martial law. People are going to stand up against them. I just don't want to hand the
[01:55:41.820 --> 01:55:51.100]  system, the optics, the visual that makes gunners look like we're on the offense taking
[01:55:51.100 --> 01:55:56.020]  over things because that's how it's being misrepresented to the dumbbells. And I just
[01:55:56.020 --> 01:56:01.260]  don't think it's the high ground position like it was with what the bundies and my reporters
[01:56:01.260 --> 01:56:05.460]  were there right at the front lines. David Knight and Josh Ellen supporting it, marching
[01:56:05.460 --> 01:56:10.300]  right through when the feds were saying, we're going to shoot you. But the Patriots didn't
[01:56:10.300 --> 01:56:14.340]  name guns. They didn't say we have a perimeter. They said, we're marching through your perimeter
[01:56:14.340 --> 01:56:18.700]  and the feds had to back down. And man, there were those voices there saying, get rid of
[01:56:18.700 --> 01:56:24.180]  the info wars reporters, their fans. And of course, those were obviously, you know, who
[01:56:24.180 --> 01:56:28.460]  tried to divide and conquer people. I'm a citizen. I have a right to my opinion. This
[01:56:28.460 --> 01:56:32.420]  is not the best time and best place for this to happen. And I'm not saying the bunnies
[01:56:32.420 --> 01:56:37.860]  are feds. I don't think they are. I just think that this is going down a bad road and a lot
[01:56:37.860 --> 01:56:41.540]  of smarter feds on the ground know that the Obama people have said they want a big armed
[01:56:41.540 --> 01:56:45.740]  confrontation to try to kick off a civil war. But the feds themselves are saying, we're
[01:56:45.740 --> 01:56:50.060]  not going to do anything. And so it'll turn into a big competition for the folks inside
[01:56:50.060 --> 01:56:54.740]  that federal barn they've taken over, asking for snacks. I mean, you go, they're begging
[01:56:54.740 --> 01:57:03.340]  for food. Last time I heard that's what folks do on the side of the road. So that's where
[01:57:03.340 --> 01:57:07.340]  I stand in all of this. And I don't want to kick something physical off right now. We're
[01:57:07.340 --> 01:57:12.500]  making major inroads waking up the feds across the board, waking up others. We don't want
[01:57:12.500 --> 01:57:17.780]  to give the globalist the civil war they want in closing. I'll cover it. Marta Mara,
[01:57:17.780 --> 01:57:23.820]  11am central when the big weekday show kicks off. Here's what Sean Penn agreed to do to
[01:57:23.820 --> 01:57:28.260]  party with El Chapo. They're talking about charging Sean Penn with working with this
[01:57:28.260 --> 01:57:33.380]  drug dealing terrorist. This drug dealing terrorist that came out in mainstream articles, Business
[01:57:33.380 --> 01:57:41.020]  Insider El Paso times Chicago Tribune that their CIA running the drugs into America and
[01:57:41.020 --> 01:57:46.180]  the CIA turned on them. That came out in federal court. So leave the gun grabbing dumb ass Sean
[01:57:46.180 --> 01:57:46.820]  Penn alone.
