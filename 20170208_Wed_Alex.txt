[00:00.000 --> 00:10.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live, it's Wednesday, February 8, 2017.
[00:10.640 --> 00:15.240]  The Democrats are melting down like a bunch of mentally ill children.
[00:15.240 --> 00:17.320]  What are we going to do?
[00:17.320 --> 00:24.080]  How can a president who is acting in the manner that he's acting, whether he's talking about
[00:24.080 --> 00:29.920]  the travel ban, the way that he's targeting Muslims, or whether he's talking about his
[00:29.920 --> 00:37.520]  relationship to Putin and the Kremlin, and knowing that they have hacked our DCCC and
[00:37.520 --> 00:46.720]  DNC, and knowing that he is responsible for supplying the bombs that killed innocent
[00:46.720 --> 00:51.400]  children and families in, in...
[00:51.400 --> 00:52.400]  What is Aleppo?
[00:52.400 --> 00:53.400]  Yeah, in Aleppo.
[00:53.400 --> 00:54.400]  You are correct.
[00:54.400 --> 00:55.400]  Way to go.
[00:55.400 --> 00:56.400]  Thank you.
[00:56.400 --> 01:11.080]  The fact that he is wrapping his arms around Putin while Putin is continuing to advance
[01:11.080 --> 01:12.080]  into Korea...
[01:12.080 --> 01:30.040]  The pathetic and delusional Democrats were at it again, their stomachs growling with
[01:30.040 --> 01:32.920]  an insatiable hunger for hubris and lunacy.
[01:32.920 --> 01:37.840]  They scurried to a microphone that actually worked this time as they tried to sell the
[01:37.840 --> 01:41.680]  American voters a belly full of fiction yet again.
[01:41.680 --> 01:43.720]  What are we going to do?
[01:43.720 --> 01:50.280]  How can a president who is acting in the manner that he's acting, whether he's talking about
[01:50.280 --> 01:55.960]  the travel ban, the way that he's targeting Muslims, or whether he's talking about his
[01:55.960 --> 02:03.280]  relationship to Putin and the Kremlin, and knowing that they have hacked our DCCC and
[02:03.280 --> 02:12.280]  DNC, and knowing that he is responsible for supplying the bombs that killed innocent
[02:12.280 --> 02:19.080]  children and families in Aleppo.
[02:19.080 --> 02:27.320]  And the fact that he is wrapping his arms around Putin while Putin is continuing to advance
[02:27.320 --> 02:30.280]  into Korea.
[02:30.280 --> 02:37.560]  I think that he is leading himself into that kind of position where folks will begin to
[02:37.560 --> 02:42.200]  ask what are we going to do and the answer is going to be, eventually we've got to do
[02:42.200 --> 02:43.440]  something about him.
[02:43.440 --> 02:47.960]  We cannot continue to have a president who's acting in this manner.
[02:47.960 --> 02:50.480]  It is dangerous to the United States of America.
[02:50.480 --> 02:53.880]  Leader Pelosi, do you agree?
[02:53.880 --> 02:58.880]  Minority leader Nancy Pelosi only served to reassure the voters that her mind is not
[02:58.880 --> 03:00.600]  firing on all cylinders.
[03:00.600 --> 03:05.840]  Yes, we've seen nothing that we can work, but I can work with President Bush on it.
[03:05.840 --> 03:10.400]  Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel told the flustered Democrats to take a chill pill.
[03:10.400 --> 03:15.680]  Of course, when you are being criticized by Rahm Emanuel, who has overseen more homicides
[03:15.680 --> 03:21.480]  in Chicago than the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan combined, it may be time to hang up the desperate
[03:21.480 --> 03:26.840]  daily dismantling of President Donald Trump's agenda before the Democratic Party is finally
[03:26.840 --> 03:32.560]  hauled into court over the millions of dollars it has received from Captain Subversion, a.k.a.
[03:32.560 --> 03:36.960]  Hedge Fund Billionaire and former Nazi collaborator George Soros.
[03:36.960 --> 03:42.000]  But it appears that President Donald Trump's adversaries have lined up on both sides of
[03:42.000 --> 03:47.800]  the aisle thanks to donations by the billion dollar Soros machine, sediciously ceding chaos
[03:47.800 --> 03:49.240]  in the United States.
[03:49.240 --> 03:54.440]  Breitbart reported perhaps even more significant as the type of Republican they aimed to prop
[03:54.440 --> 03:55.440]  up.
[03:55.440 --> 04:01.000]  In 2016, pro-open borders on trade and generally speaking anti-Trump, a pattern emerges when
[04:01.000 --> 04:05.840]  looking at the policies of the Republicans that these Soros fund management executives
[04:05.840 --> 04:07.280]  support financially.
[04:07.280 --> 04:12.520]  The biggest recipient of Soros connected cash in the GOP was none other than House Speaker
[04:12.520 --> 04:17.520]  Paul Ryan, who repeatedly attempted to undermine Trump over the course of the election.
[04:17.520 --> 04:23.040]  According to the records available online, the Soros firms' workers gave $10,800 to Ryan
[04:23.040 --> 04:28.480]  while Senator Lindsey Graham received $3,500 from the firm's employees.
[04:28.480 --> 04:33.680]  According to the Center for Responsive Politics Data, that includes a $1,500 donation from
[04:33.680 --> 04:36.840]  Soros fund management executive Scott Besin.
[04:36.840 --> 04:43.320]  Senator Marco Rubio raked in $2,700 while other failed GOP presidential candidates Ohio Governor
[04:43.320 --> 04:50.800]  John Kasich and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush also received $2,700 apiece from employees
[04:50.800 --> 04:52.360]  of the Soros firm.
[04:52.360 --> 04:56.160]  The national conversation needs to rid itself of the ongoing...
[04:56.160 --> 04:59.280]  Look who's being discriminated against now, Republicans.
[04:59.280 --> 05:02.960]  That's right, a new leftist fight club has started at the University of Central Florida
[05:02.960 --> 05:08.440]  where the Knights for Socialism have organized to teach left-wingers how to bash the fasc.
[05:08.440 --> 05:10.800]  No Republicans or Trump supporters allowed.
[05:10.800 --> 05:13.800]  Donning the Antifa logo, you can find them on Facebook.
[05:13.800 --> 05:16.000]  So I guess the first rule doesn't apply to these guys.
[05:16.000 --> 05:19.880]  They want to show off the fact they're getting together to train to beat down Trump supporters
[05:19.880 --> 05:24.720]  because the previous incidents of beating, pepper spraying, kidnapping, lighting on fire,
[05:24.720 --> 05:25.720]  wasn't enough.
[05:25.720 --> 05:29.520]  Of course, the irony is they cite the rise in hate crimes against Latinos, immigrants,
[05:29.520 --> 05:35.360]  Muslims, women, the LGBTQIA, whatever that is, community, Jews, African Americans, since
[05:35.360 --> 05:40.280]  the rise of Trump and other alt-right neo-Nazis, even though all evidence points to a rise
[05:40.280 --> 05:42.840]  in hate crimes against Trump supporters.
[05:42.840 --> 05:47.560]  So I guess if this isn't a terrorist group, no longer will we see the cheap shot and run
[05:47.560 --> 05:51.400]  technique now leftists are just going to toe up on the streets.
[05:51.400 --> 06:20.440]  This is Owen Schreuer from the Information Fight Club.
[06:20.440 --> 06:45.680]  Get
[06:45.680 --> 06:52.680]  This is Alex Jones. I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off-the-grid products of 2017.
[06:52.680 --> 06:55.680]  And seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[06:55.680 --> 07:00.680]  I'm talking about the PPX Solar Generator System from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[07:00.680 --> 07:03.680]  The PPX is so small, you can put it in your pocket.
[07:03.680 --> 07:05.680]  But so powerful, you can run.
[07:05.680 --> 07:25.680]  Some 110 appliances at your house, like a small refrigerator so you can keep food from spoiling. Plus, you can take it with you to jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes.
[07:25.680 --> 07:32.680]  The system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, allowing you to create your own private power grid, literally anywhere in the world.
[07:32.680 --> 07:37.680]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, anytime you need to get off the grid for a while.
[07:37.680 --> 07:42.680]  Go to privatepowergrid.com to watch this thing in action. That's privatepowergrid.com.
[07:42.680 --> 07:48.680]  Even better, use coupon code PRIVATE at checkout and get a second PPX Energy Unit for free.
[07:48.680 --> 07:53.680]  Check it out at privatepowergrid.com. That's privatepowergrid.com.
[07:53.680 --> 08:10.680]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[08:10.680 --> 08:23.680]  It was so beautiful this morning to watch President Trump addressing the National Association of Sheriffs in Washington D.C.
[08:23.680 --> 08:35.680]  It was so beautiful to see Veritas as the 45th President of the United States read repeatedly, very, very slowly, to the television cameras
[08:35.680 --> 08:46.680]  and to the hundreds of millions of people that will end up watching it, the millions watching live, that he's following the exact law that many, many presidents have used
[08:46.680 --> 08:54.680]  and that his executive order was only a limited, highly restrained use of existing law.
[08:54.680 --> 09:07.680]  Now, you juxtapose that with the Cloud Cuckoo Land corporate PSYOP media. Much of it openly run by leftist foundations that control the CIA, this is all declassified,
[09:07.680 --> 09:15.680]  telling you that if there's a blue sky, you don't see that sun up there at high noon, talking to you like you're crazy.
[09:15.680 --> 09:26.680]  The Germans believed it. The Russians were two miles away from Hitler's chancellery and Germans still believed that the Fuhrer was going to win and that Steiner was defeating them.
[09:26.680 --> 09:38.680]  And you got to understand, MSM is in the biggest cult of it all. They are totally indoctrinated and hired because of narcissistic tendencies and cult tendencies believing they're invincible and unstoppable,
[09:38.680 --> 09:46.680]  even as the Allied forces close in in a pincer attack. I'm using the German analogy because we have Derspiegel here.
[09:46.680 --> 09:57.680]  The same folks that brought us the iconic image, I got to say it's a powerful image of Trump chopping the head off of the Statue of Liberty when actually they used to bring folks in and test them for TB and the bubonic plague.
[09:57.680 --> 10:07.680]  Now they don't test them for that. I've had Border Patrol Union heads on. They bring people in with TB but get this leprosy and then it ends up in Los Angeles schools.
[10:07.680 --> 10:16.680]  Remember I told you about that four years ago? We had ICE officers faces blurred. Oh yes, leprosy spreading all over the United States but they keep it real quiet.
[10:16.680 --> 10:28.680]  So the truth is we should show an image of Trump trying to battle jihadis cutting a woman's head off because that's what he's doing trying to block people from Libya,
[10:28.680 --> 10:38.680]  a open failed state that Hillary and Obama and his cohorts created like the Secretary of State after that, John Kerry, or Syria, the Civil War.
[10:38.680 --> 10:46.680]  They helped launch five years ago aiding the jihadis out of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and other countries to invade and take it over.
[10:46.680 --> 11:02.680]  Their whole project of the Arab Spring overthrowing our allies in Egypt, having Peter Sutherland of the UN Migration Board open the borders of Europe up and invite in the Muslim radical hordes to destabilize the once free western republics.
[11:02.680 --> 11:08.680]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, that would be the real image would be jihadis cutting the Statue of Liberty's head off.
[11:08.680 --> 11:17.680]  But again, most people don't even know the Statue of Liberty's real history or that if memory serves me, wasn't it refused by a Muslim country?
[11:17.680 --> 11:23.680]  Let's look up the history of that and see if my memory serves like your spiegel today. I said the mainstream media is committing sepica.
[11:23.680 --> 11:28.680]  They said, what is that? And I said, I believe it's suicide in Japan, honorable suicide with a short sword.
[11:28.680 --> 11:32.680]  But I said, let's Google it. Can the guys Google that for me real quick? I forgot to do that.
[11:32.680 --> 11:38.680]  Let's see if my memory from 25 years ago is I'm correct. Let's put sepico up on screen.
[11:38.680 --> 11:48.680]  Am I right that Egypt refused? Is it fitting the Muslims refused the Statue of Liberty as an occultic omen at the entrance of the Nile into the Mediterranean?
[11:48.680 --> 11:55.680]  Let's look that up and see if the old conspiracy diddly doop has the info. Correct.
[11:55.680 --> 12:06.680]  The crew's in there telling me I'm correct. Let's put sepico on screen. S-E-P-P-U-K-U is what their spiegel and the NSM is doing in front of all of us.
[12:06.680 --> 12:18.680]  The practice of thrusting a short sword into the right side into the liver and going up towards the middle sternum and jabbing the tip of the blade into the heart.
[12:18.680 --> 12:25.680]  Of course, the MSM will probably tell us hearts don't exist and women never gave birth vaginally and that breasts never produced milk.
[12:25.680 --> 12:31.680]  Because the state produces milk as they teach the children to pray to Hugo Chavez in Venezuela.
[12:31.680 --> 12:40.680]  But let me continue before I digress anymore. We've got a big broadcast and a bunch of special guests, Milo's joining us and so much more today.
[12:40.680 --> 12:50.680]  But we got the little secret document. It's up on infowars.com. Dr. Jerome Corsi, three-time number one New York Times bestseller investigative journalist, has gotten the document.
[12:50.680 --> 12:58.680]  Leaked Docs brought conspires with Facebook, Google to shut down conservative media and we have the blueprint.
[12:58.680 --> 13:05.680]  Our little boffin spies were able to get into the imperial database and get you that information.
[13:05.680 --> 13:10.680]  And no amount of little David Brock. He's now cut his little poodle haircut down.
[13:10.680 --> 13:13.680]  Knows what a clown he looks like. He's now reinventing himself again.
[13:13.680 --> 13:19.680]  Radical Left launches Scorched Earth policy against free speech and then we see the results of it today.
[13:19.680 --> 13:27.680]  New video game, Puncha Nazi, glorifies assaulting Milo and Trump supporters because if you have blonde hair or blue eyes, you're bad.
[13:27.680 --> 13:30.680]  Which is basically the same thing as Nazism just reversed.
[13:30.680 --> 13:35.680]  Facebook blocks links to stories about immigration as abusive.
[13:35.680 --> 13:40.680]  Twitter removing core functions banning alt-right to create liberal safe space.
[13:40.680 --> 13:44.680]  The Left hates you. Act accordingly. Powerful Town Hall article.
[13:44.680 --> 13:51.680]  And meanwhile the army preps for urban warfare in mega cities, mass migration, disaster and inner city turmoil.
[13:51.680 --> 13:59.680]  And what will the media do? They'll say Alex Jones out of the clear blue sky said the military was training to invade America and take your guns.
[13:59.680 --> 14:05.680]  I didn't say that. I said I'm going to get to a report from the army itself.
[14:05.680 --> 14:11.680]  Where they're preparing for mass implosion of the borders, civil unrest and basically collapse of society.
[14:11.680 --> 14:17.680]  I'm not saying the army wants to do this. I'm not saying the army's bad. I'm not saying there's a coming invasion.
[14:17.680 --> 14:22.680]  I'm saying we're going to cover their own documents where they're massively preparing for civil unrest.
[14:22.680 --> 14:25.680]  George Soros and his cohorts are funding.
[14:25.680 --> 14:32.680]  But instead they'll just say, Jones says the army's going to invade Texas and enslave everyone.
[14:32.680 --> 14:39.680]  And hope that limited audience of pseudo-intellectuals with two or three worthless college degrees that are totally freaked out without a family.
[14:39.680 --> 14:42.680]  Without anything. But they've got cool facial hair or whatever.
[14:42.680 --> 14:48.680]  And they don't know why they have nothing. And they're just screaming out saying, I'll triple down on your engineering.
[14:48.680 --> 14:52.680]  I'll do whatever you say. I won't live in a single family dwelling. I won't have a car.
[14:52.680 --> 14:56.680]  I'll do whatever you say. I'll take all the pro's act. Just make me happy.
[14:56.680 --> 14:59.680]  And they say, we're never going to make you happy.
[14:59.680 --> 15:02.680]  Now go beat up an old white woman because she's white.
[15:02.680 --> 15:07.680]  They're like, but I'm white. Prove that you know whites are bad. Attack the other whites.
[15:07.680 --> 15:11.680]  But you're white. It's okay. I'm a master white. I'm a good white.
[15:11.680 --> 15:15.680]  Now we have all these immigrant friends we've brought in who we've taught to hate the whites.
[15:15.680 --> 15:17.680]  But we lead them. Understand?
[15:17.680 --> 15:22.680]  Classic divide and conquer. And you can read all the WikiLeaks. Keep them desperate. Keep them in the dark.
[15:22.680 --> 15:25.680]  Keep them freaked out. Use cultural warfare.
[15:25.680 --> 15:28.680]  Escalate the culture wars. Escalate.
[15:28.680 --> 15:32.680]  These are horrible, evil people. And we have them.
[15:32.680 --> 15:38.680]  We have them dead to rights exposed from pillar to post up one side and down the other.
[15:38.680 --> 15:40.680]  But still they're in the bunker.
[15:40.680 --> 15:47.680]  And minefura, the steiner will defeat them. Yes, we have armies here and there and we will win.
[15:47.680 --> 15:52.680]  Lord Soros says he will help us. Yes, yes, so he will.
[15:52.680 --> 15:58.680]  Literal Nazi collaborator. Yes, so now the analogy comes back to reality because it's what we're facing.
[15:58.680 --> 16:04.680]  And only by reaching out to the program left with all their Nazi guilt cosmology including people in America that defeated the Nazis.
[16:04.680 --> 16:09.680]  See, I'm a Nazi according to, you know, NPR everybody even though both my grandfathers are the Nazis.
[16:09.680 --> 16:14.680]  Imagine being the Germans. Imagine that shared guilt where there's actually some tenuous connection.
[16:14.680 --> 16:23.680]  Oh, so you have to reach out and show them how they have just adopted another authoritarian system just like the Stasi, just like all the rest of it.
[16:23.680 --> 16:27.680]  And how their enslavement has basically become complete.
[16:27.680 --> 16:32.680]  So coming up, LeakDocs brought conspires with Facebook, Google to shut down conservative media.
[16:32.680 --> 16:36.680]  This is a bombshell article that needs to go viral.
[16:36.680 --> 16:41.680]  We're going to tie it into all of it today. But before I go any further, let's get to that incredible speech
[16:41.680 --> 16:48.680]  given just two and a half hours ago by the 45th president of the United States where he attacks fake polls
[16:48.680 --> 16:57.680]  and where he exposes the enemy, the foreign owned corporate sloth media, the dinosaur giant sloth media
[16:57.680 --> 17:01.680]  that is now digging its own grave in front of everyone and has already basically climbed in
[17:01.680 --> 17:08.680]  and has now dumping piles of dirt on top of itself with pleasure, with delusional pleasure.
[17:08.680 --> 17:15.680]  So all that psychosis is going on. Trump continues to basically turn the knife and reads the law.
[17:15.680 --> 17:22.680]  Let's just hope the night circuit of globalist cultural boobies.
[17:22.680 --> 17:30.680]  Let's hope that those pirates assaulting our sovereignty realize that it's going to be good if they do this
[17:30.680 --> 17:35.680]  because now the courts will be completely discredited even more.
[17:35.680 --> 17:40.680]  Good. Continue to discredit yourselves. Continue to burn down your own house.
[17:40.680 --> 17:45.680]  Continue to ignore a statute that a five-year-old could understand.
[17:45.680 --> 17:52.680]  So let's go to the commander-in-chief just hours ago devastating the enemy. Here it is.
[17:52.680 --> 18:00.680]  And I thought before I spoke about what we're really here to speak about, I would read something to you
[18:00.680 --> 18:05.680]  because you could be a lawyer or you don't have to be a lawyer.
[18:05.680 --> 18:11.680]  If you were a good student in high school or a bad student in high school, you can understand this.
[18:11.680 --> 18:18.680]  And it's really incredible to me that we have a court case that's going on so long.
[18:18.680 --> 18:24.680]  As you know, in Boston we want it with a highly respected judge and a very strong opinion.
[18:24.680 --> 18:33.680]  But now we're in an area that let's just say they are interpreting things differently
[18:33.680 --> 18:37.680]  than probably 100% of the people in this room.
[18:37.680 --> 18:41.680]  I'd like to almost know, does anybody disagree when I read this?
[18:41.680 --> 18:45.680]  But I'm going to read what's in dispute, what's in question.
[18:45.680 --> 18:55.680]  And you'll see this. It's INA 212F 8 USC 1182F.
[18:55.680 --> 19:01.680]  Suspension of entry or imposition of restrictions by the president.
[19:01.680 --> 19:10.680]  Now, this isn't just me. This is for Obama, for Ronald Reagan, for the president.
[19:10.680 --> 19:17.680]  And this was done very importantly for security, something you people know more about than all of us.
[19:17.680 --> 19:23.680]  It was done for the security of our nation, the security of our citizens
[19:23.680 --> 19:28.680]  so that people come in who aren't going to do us harm.
[19:28.680 --> 19:34.680]  And that's why it was done. And it couldn't have been written any more precisely.
[19:34.680 --> 19:40.680]  It's not like, oh gee, we wish it were written better. It was written beautifully.
[19:40.680 --> 19:43.680]  So just listen. Here's what it says. This is what they were arguing.
[19:43.680 --> 19:55.680]  Whenever the president finds that the entry of any aliens, okay, the entry, the entry of any aliens
[19:55.680 --> 20:03.680]  or of any class of aliens, so any aliens, any class of aliens, into the United States.
[20:03.680 --> 20:12.680]  So the entry of people into the United States, let's say just to be precise, of aliens into the United States.
[20:12.680 --> 20:22.680]  So any time whenever the president finds that the entry of any alien or any class of aliens into the United States
[20:22.680 --> 20:28.680]  would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, right?
[20:28.680 --> 20:41.680]  So if I find as president that a person or a group of people will be detrimental to the interests of the United States
[20:41.680 --> 20:49.680]  and certainly there's lots of examples that we have, but you shouldn't even have them necessarily.
[20:49.680 --> 21:00.680]  He may be, and he may, by proclamation and for such period as he shall deem necessary.
[21:00.680 --> 21:08.680]  Now the only mistake is they should have said he or she, but hopefully it won't be a she for at least another seven years after that.
[21:08.680 --> 21:19.680]  See, I just noticed that actually, just noticed it. I'm saying, whoa, this is not politically correct.
[21:19.680 --> 21:23.680]  It's correct, but it's not politically correct, you know, these are the old days.
[21:23.680 --> 21:28.680]  He may, by proclamation and for such period as he shall deem necessary.
[21:28.680 --> 21:39.680]  So here it is, people coming in, suspend the entry of all aliens, right?
[21:39.680 --> 21:45.680]  It's what it says. It's not like, again, a bad high school student would understand this.
[21:45.680 --> 21:47.680]  Anybody would understand this.
[21:47.680 --> 21:54.680]  Suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or non-immigrants.
[21:54.680 --> 22:00.680]  Or impose on the entry of aliens. So you can suspend the aliens, right?
[22:00.680 --> 22:05.680]  You can suspend the aliens from coming in. Very strong.
[22:05.680 --> 22:14.680]  Or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.
[22:14.680 --> 22:20.680]  Okay. So you can suspend, you can put restrictions, you can do whatever you want.
[22:20.680 --> 22:26.680]  And this is for the security of the country, which, again, you're the chiefs, you're the sheriffs.
[22:26.680 --> 22:28.680]  You understand this.
[22:28.680 --> 22:35.680]  And I listened to lawyers on both sides last night and they were talking about things that had just nothing to do with it.
[22:35.680 --> 22:39.680]  I listened to a panel of judges and I'll comment on that.
[22:39.680 --> 22:44.680]  I will not comment on the statements made by certainly one judge.
[22:44.680 --> 22:59.680]  But I have to be honest that if these judges wanted to, in my opinion, help the court in terms of respect for the court,
[22:59.680 --> 23:01.680]  they do what they should be doing.
[23:01.680 --> 23:08.680]  I mean, it's so sad. They should be, you know, when you read something so simple and so beautifully written,
[23:08.680 --> 23:14.680]  other than the one statement, of course, having to do with he or she.
[23:14.680 --> 23:21.680]  But when you read something so perfectly written and so clear to anybody and then you have lawyers and you watched,
[23:21.680 --> 23:27.680]  I watched last night in amazement and I heard things that I couldn't believe.
[23:27.680 --> 23:33.680]  Things that really had nothing to do with what I just read.
[23:33.680 --> 23:38.680]  And I don't ever want to call a court biased, so I won't call it biased.
[23:38.680 --> 23:41.680]  And we haven't had a decision yet.
[23:41.680 --> 23:56.680]  But courts seem to be so political and it would be so great for a justice system if they would be able to read a statement and do what's right.
[23:56.680 --> 24:00.680]  That's right. And they go, oh my gosh, a president's never attacked the court like this.
[24:00.680 --> 24:09.680]  It's fascism when there have been Supreme Court justices and people arrested and put on house arrest by presidents.
[24:09.680 --> 24:12.680]  And I'm not calling for things Lincoln did.
[24:12.680 --> 24:16.680]  But it's like, hey, you're legislating from the bench.
[24:16.680 --> 24:24.680]  You're not supposed to do that. This law, a five-year-old can understand that, forget a bad high school student.
[24:24.680 --> 24:27.680]  And then they just sit there with a straight face going, no, no, it doesn't say that.
[24:27.680 --> 24:43.680]  It doesn't say that because he's trying to block somebody because of their religion, specifically, no, from unvetted nations that have a cult version of that religion that says you should blow yourself up to kill the infidels.
[24:43.680 --> 24:46.680]  And we've all seen what's happening with that.
[24:46.680 --> 24:56.680]  And by the way, coming up today, we have one of the big whistleblowers coming on who came out two years ago.
[24:56.680 --> 25:02.680]  And we have a guest joining us, Philip Haney, who was a high-level analyst for the customs department.
[25:02.680 --> 25:18.680]  And he goes over the memos they were given, being told, do not even say that Muslim extremism exists or ask someone, give their part of Islamic jihad or part of Hamas or part of the PLO or part of Hezbollah,
[25:18.680 --> 25:24.680]  because it doesn't exist. And then you saw that on the media where there'd be terror attacks in San Bernardino or Fort Hood.
[25:24.680 --> 25:28.680]  This isn't an Islamic attack. They're screaming Allah Akbar.
[25:28.680 --> 25:34.680]  So this is the mind control. And again, you want to see the style of it.
[25:34.680 --> 25:43.680]  Look at Germany, look at Sweden, look at France, where it is mass Stockholm syndrome.
[25:43.680 --> 25:51.680]  And people are into worshiping their abusers. They're into self-loathing, and it's a form of cuckolding.
[25:51.680 --> 26:00.680]  It is. The women go out and hand flowers out to the jihadists, and after there's mass rapes and grovel, and again, I hate Germany, I hate Sweden, I hate France.
[26:00.680 --> 26:06.680]  I want to submit to you, and the Imam of Jerusalem gets up on TV and says, they are wicked Europe.
[26:06.680 --> 26:11.680]  There are women on earth. We will take them, and we will take over with the children.
[26:11.680 --> 26:26.680]  The West is going to fall in Hezbollah. Everyone's like, we worship you. Just destroy us, kill us. It's mass cultural suicide.
[26:26.680 --> 26:32.680]  And then Trump dares stand up against it, and they just squeal and yell and lie.
[26:32.680 --> 26:38.680]  It's like when he fired the new attorney general that was an interim attorney general because she wouldn't follow his legal order.
[26:38.680 --> 26:48.680]  They went Monday night massacre, CNN, unprecedented hatred and evil.
[26:48.680 --> 26:51.680]  But because they can't debate as they're trying to censor us everywhere.
[26:51.680 --> 26:57.680]  So let's go to Alan Dershowitz, big liberal lawyer, but he's saying, no, Trump has the power to do what he's doing.
[26:57.680 --> 27:03.680]  And this is a war against the delusionals and those of us that are in the fact-based reality world.
[27:03.680 --> 27:08.680]  Right-wingers that are just as bad like Carl Rove saying he controls reality. He didn't control reality when I could find him in an airport.
[27:08.680 --> 27:16.680]  He was basically pissing his pants. Let's go just from questions. Let's go ahead and go to the Alan Dershowitz clip.
[27:16.680 --> 27:20.680]  I think you could have made a much stronger argument on the whole establishment clause issue.
[27:20.680 --> 27:27.680]  Here you have the United States government taking the position that this is Islamic terrorism as the same as from the prior administration.
[27:27.680 --> 27:29.680]  That's their position. It's Islamic terrorism.
[27:29.680 --> 27:34.680]  Why should anybody be surprised that the seven nations are nations of Islam?
[27:34.680 --> 27:40.680]  Consider what was one of the greatest successes in American history, the War Refugee Board in 1944.
[27:40.680 --> 27:49.680]  That was focused on specifically rescuing Jews because Jews were the victims of Nazism.
[27:49.680 --> 27:55.680]  And here you have a statute that specifically focused on rescuing minority religions.
[27:55.680 --> 27:59.680]  That could be Sunnis and Shia countries. It could be Kurds.
[27:59.680 --> 28:03.680]  This is not an establishment clause violation.
[28:03.680 --> 28:08.680]  And I'm shocked that the government did not make a stronger argument for that.
[28:08.680 --> 28:14.680]  Now let's expand on something here too.
[28:14.680 --> 28:28.680]  Syria, before the globalist pogrom to drive the Christians out, the UN admits persecution of Christians at all time highs, was roughly 20% Christian.
[28:28.680 --> 28:37.680]  If you go look at who Obama let out, it's something like 0.2, 0.4 depending on the period. They won't let Christians get out.
[28:37.680 --> 28:40.680]  Most of them are actually Sunnis.
[28:40.680 --> 28:50.680]  They don't really let Shiites get out either. This is a resupply effort of the failed Sunni Wahhabist armies that came in from all over the world.
[28:50.680 --> 28:58.680]  From Chechnya, Saudi Arabia, North Africa, for the great Hodge of Jihad.
[28:58.680 --> 29:02.680]  The House of Islam is the House of Islam. Outside the House is the House of War.
[29:02.680 --> 29:15.680]  And so they came to get living space. They came to get new land. They came to invade and take the prosperous country of Syria, just as the Saudi Arabians had done in the last century.
[29:15.680 --> 29:28.680]  And so they came in and they got their ass kicked, so they had to have Turkey and Merkel and everybody open the doors, advertise, have the media, you know, stage little dead kids on the side of the beach and say, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[29:28.680 --> 29:34.680]  Bring down Europe. Let's get it going. EU. Let's collapse this sucker. And it's in all the loving EU documents.
[29:34.680 --> 29:44.680]  Peter Sutherland, we're going to end the homogeneity of Europe. Anti-white racist garbage. We'll be back. Stay with us.
[29:44.680 --> 29:55.680]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:55.680 --> 29:59.680]  Not a group you develop living defense for us. It took you over a year to do it. Why is this so good?
[29:59.680 --> 30:10.680]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most. I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system.
[30:10.680 --> 30:22.680]  But right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees spreading disease around.
[30:22.680 --> 30:28.680]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere. These are all parasites. Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[30:28.680 --> 30:36.680]  You have the neem in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood. I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[30:36.680 --> 30:40.680]  All right. Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today. It just came back in yesterday.

[33:00.680 --> 33:16.680]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[33:16.680 --> 33:22.680]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[33:22.680 --> 33:38.680]  What are we going to do? How can a president who is acting in the manner that he's acting, whether he's talking about the travel ban, the way that he's targeting Muslims,
[33:38.680 --> 34:03.680]  or whether he's talking about his relationship to Putin and the Kremlin, and knowing that they have hacked our DCCC and DNC, and knowing that he is responsible for supplying the bombs that killed innocent children and families in Aleppo.
[34:03.680 --> 34:13.680]  Yeah, in Aleppo. You are correct.
[34:13.680 --> 34:30.680]  The fact that he is wrapping his arms around Putin while Putin is continuing to advance into Korea.
[34:30.680 --> 34:34.680]  Stop it. That's right. Great intro by Darren McBreen.
[34:34.680 --> 34:45.680]  That was all from yesterday. Maxine Waters, and we didn't even add the clip from Nancy Pelosi, saying, we're sick of George W. Bush and what he's doing to these poor migrants.
[34:45.680 --> 35:01.680]  Then they start going, yeah, and he's helping Putin invade Korea and Aleppo, and they are just doddering crazy people. That's who we're dealing with. Their constituents are just as stupid as they are.
[35:01.680 --> 35:16.680]  They blame Russia for what happened in Ukraine. And then, meanwhile, George Soros goes on Fareed Zarkaria and admits they funded the whole thing with $5 billion of taxpayer money and overthrew the elected government. That's a fact.
[35:16.680 --> 35:28.680]  I'm not pro-Russia. But they say, Jones quit lying. You know Putin did it. You know Putin invaded Ukraine.
[35:28.680 --> 35:34.680]  What, the little Russian held area right on their border that's almost completely Russian and always been part of Russia?
[35:34.680 --> 35:42.680]  They fought a bunch of wars over. Again, it's the West starting all the wars and Trump's trying to stop that.
[35:42.680 --> 35:49.680]  But instead, the left calls him Hitler and a warmonger and says that he's trying to start a war.
[35:49.680 --> 35:57.680]  When, of course, the West is working with Western Ukraine that was actually the side in World War II that worked with Hitler.
[35:57.680 --> 36:04.680]  See, because we want to throw Hitler around today, I'm just going to keep going back to really who's with Hitler. George Soros with Hitler.
[36:04.680 --> 36:10.680]  The Western Ukrainians with Hitler. You want me to keep going a little bit of Hitler for you? Because I can do it for a long time.
[36:10.680 --> 36:21.680]  But I can also put their Spiegel's big magazine cover up with Trump cutting off the Statue of Liberty's head, the sun god's head.
[36:21.680 --> 36:27.680]  America first means cutting Liberty's head off. No, it means we're not here to bankroll the world government.
[36:27.680 --> 36:34.680]  We're not here to pay for NATO and pay for Japan's security and pay for South Korea's security while our country goes into a nosedive.
[36:34.680 --> 36:42.680]  We're going to have the same taxes on goods that other countries do. We're not going to have a $700-plus billion trade deficit with China every year.
[36:42.680 --> 36:49.680]  That's the latest numbers that are out. I'm not going to show you the real beheadings because MSM will shut our channels down and block us if we do.
[36:49.680 --> 36:59.680]  They're allowed to show it though when they choose. We're not going to show you the real beheadings, but we can show you hour after hour of little kids chopping people's heads off, little kids being taught to do it.
[36:59.680 --> 37:08.680]  We can show you footage of this for hour after hour of the jihadis that they're letting into Europe and they're letting into the United States who they've been letting in.
[37:08.680 --> 37:21.680]  I mean, three years ago, ISIS said, we're going to have a huge migrant wave as a way to flood you and get our jihadis into Europe in public announcements that they themselves put out.
[37:21.680 --> 37:32.680]  And then reporters look at me like I'm crazy and I say, massive amounts of Islamic jihad people are coming in, Al-Nusra, Al-Qaeda, ISIS, all the same, Wahhabist group.
[37:32.680 --> 37:35.680]  And they just look at me and laugh and they just go, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[37:35.680 --> 37:41.680]  Like, I know that works on the average person that can't tie their shoelaces, which have been living under this educational system.
[37:41.680 --> 37:46.680]  It doesn't work on me. It doesn't work on my audience.
[37:46.680 --> 37:51.680]  I'm never going to have the host of ABC Nightly News here who's doing a nightline piece. And he said, there's no world government, Alex.
[37:51.680 --> 37:53.680]  They're not setting up a world government.
[37:53.680 --> 38:02.680]  And I said, let me show you six clips of world leaders from the head of the EU, the British Prime Minister, to an American president calling for world government.
[38:02.680 --> 38:07.680]  And he looked at me and he goes, that's a different global government than the one you mean.
[38:07.680 --> 38:18.680]  In some type of gas-lighting, mind-control world, you know, where Gibbs gets up and tells us that there are no drone operations going on many years after it's a public program.
[38:18.680 --> 38:25.680]  Or Obama cares free. Or there's no desk panels. Or there's no IRS enforcers of it.
[38:25.680 --> 38:29.680]  On and on and on. And that's why the American people are so awake.
[38:29.680 --> 38:34.680]  But you see now, they understand that we are exposing what they're doing.
[38:34.680 --> 38:51.680]  So their answer is Obama signed a bill two weeks before he left office in early January of 2017, just a month and a half ago.
[38:51.680 --> 39:00.680]  And in that Defense Authorization Act, the State Department and the CIA are over the Board of Governors of the FCC
[39:00.680 --> 39:10.680]  and declared total control over all media, not just broadcasts, transmissions, digital print, everything.
[39:10.680 --> 39:15.680]  And just as Trump killed the TPP, he said it's unconstitutional, a president shouldn't even negotiate this.
[39:15.680 --> 39:18.680]  I kill it. I don't withdraw, I kill it.
[39:18.680 --> 39:25.680]  And I moved to withdraw from NAFTA and GATT because you have to renegotiate because that was passed as a law.
[39:25.680 --> 39:34.680]  And I really want the president and Rex Tillerson to move to kill those hundreds of millions of dollars
[39:34.680 --> 39:40.680]  that they now are going to give, you cannot make this up, to David Brock Snopes,
[39:40.680 --> 39:48.680]  a mail order diploma catalog group out of Florida and several other consortiums that will create the fake news list,
[39:48.680 --> 39:55.680]  which will then be memory-hold, black-hold and put into the Phantom Zone. And that's all coming up.
[39:55.680 --> 39:59.680]  But let's first talk about another big fraud that we haven't gotten to since it broke on Sunday.
[39:59.680 --> 40:02.680]  We've mentioned it. Leigh Ann McAdoo reports.
[40:02.680 --> 40:07.680]  World leaders duped by fake climate change data. No, they weren't duped.
[40:07.680 --> 40:09.680]  They knew what they were part of in most cases.
[40:09.680 --> 40:14.680]  We've done this for six years out of East Anglia where they say we've got to hide the decline.
[40:14.680 --> 40:20.680]  The Earth quit warming 19 years ago, they say. This is now six years ago, three, 25 years ago.
[40:20.680 --> 40:25.680]  And it's begun cooling the last three. We must hide the decline. And how do we do it?
[40:25.680 --> 40:31.680]  With fake temperature data, fake thermometers that don't exist, hiding the decline.
[40:31.680 --> 40:36.680]  It's all there, coordinating. All these other universities have a lot of the public and get the funds
[40:36.680 --> 40:43.680]  to make them all the little saviors of the Earth telling Africans you can't have cars or air conditioning.
[40:43.680 --> 40:47.680]  Boy, talk about racist, but see, it's okay because it's liberal.
[40:47.680 --> 40:51.680]  It's liberal when they do it. It's a war against everybody's resources.
[40:51.680 --> 40:58.680]  It's a planetary eugenics management system that uses divide and conquer to politically control people
[40:58.680 --> 41:04.680]  while their resources are cut off. It's clowered and pivot writ large.
[41:04.680 --> 41:11.680]  And now they've been caught and top climate experts, NASA people, you name it, insiders are coming out going,
[41:11.680 --> 41:17.680]  yeah, no, it wasn't just fake temperature data. There were no thermometers in hundreds of locations.
[41:17.680 --> 41:23.680]  It's made up, academic, organized, racketeering, fraud, committed against the people.
[41:23.680 --> 41:30.680]  And that's why they're so desperate. The pedophile rings, the corrupt operations inside academia,
[41:30.680 --> 41:34.680]  the big banking scams. That's why Goldman Sachs gave 100% of his money to Hillary.
[41:34.680 --> 41:41.680]  Zero to Trump. It's why they're trying to drive down the stock market right now because they are panicking.
[41:41.680 --> 41:44.680]  Let's go to Lee Ann McAdoo's report on this.
[41:44.680 --> 41:48.680]  And I'm going to come back into the next phase of their big push for censorship.
[41:48.680 --> 41:53.680]  Oh, and something else that we've been correct about reporting.
[41:53.680 --> 41:56.680]  We told you this three, four years ago, had reporters on the ground.
[41:56.680 --> 41:59.680]  This is out of nine news out of Australia.
[41:59.680 --> 42:06.680]  That's also out of ABC News, Associated Press, Fox News are all reporting this headline today,
[42:06.680 --> 42:11.680]  which we were called thermometers for. I mean, we just had physicists, nuclear physicists,
[42:11.680 --> 42:17.680]  chemical physicists talking about it. Fukushima's radiation reaches unimaginable levels.
[42:17.680 --> 42:23.680]  And just as we said, more than one reactor is still going through meltdown.
[42:23.680 --> 42:28.680]  And they just dump water on it and have it run into the ocean. So we're going to tell you about that.
[42:28.680 --> 42:31.680]  And the response of Monbiott and other liberals is,
[42:31.680 --> 42:35.680]  radiation's good now and we should have more reactors. It's liberal.
[42:35.680 --> 42:38.680]  As long as it's liberal, it's okay.
[42:38.680 --> 42:45.680]  And of course, Ann Coulter said the Japanese on the right should be thankful for the radiation as a health treatment.
[42:45.680 --> 42:48.680]  But again, where are the fake news here, folks?
[42:48.680 --> 42:54.680]  Having Japanese nuclear physicists on and others and breaking out with real Gager counters, what was happening?
[42:54.680 --> 42:59.680]  The butterflies deformed and the kids dropping dead of heart failure all over the place from the radiation
[42:59.680 --> 43:05.680]  and the rad clouds floating around. But it's okay because the media said it was a conspiracy theory
[43:05.680 --> 43:13.680]  when milk across the United States in some cases showed thousands of times higher than what it should have been for isotubes.
[43:13.680 --> 43:17.680]  The EPA just raised the levels and said it was safe.
[43:17.680 --> 43:22.680]  But again, it's okay, everybody, because you don't want to be a conspiracy theorist.
[43:22.680 --> 43:27.680]  Just know that Fukushima's good for you and your family because the government and the state-run media
[43:27.680 --> 43:34.680]  and Tokyo Electric and General Electric, they told you and they never lie.
[43:34.680 --> 43:39.680]  Mainstream media never lies to you.
[43:39.680 --> 43:45.680]  You heard Trump read that law earlier that the president has absolute discretion to block permanently whoever he wants and feels like it.
[43:45.680 --> 43:51.680]  But you know what? Again, folks, don't listen to him. Listen to CNN and MSNBC.
[43:51.680 --> 43:56.680]  They, Anderson Cooper cares about you. Here, let's go to that report.
[43:56.680 --> 44:03.680]  World leaders were duped into investing billions of our taxpayer dollars, mind you, into this climate change agenda
[44:03.680 --> 44:08.680]  based on manipulated global warming data. Now, this is a story coming out of the Daily Mail.
[44:08.680 --> 44:11.680]  They're speaking directly with a whistleblower who has direct knowledge of this.
[44:11.680 --> 44:17.680]  He says there is astonishing evidence that NOAA, which is the organization that is the world's leading source of climate data,
[44:17.680 --> 44:24.680]  rushed to publish this landmark paper. It exaggerated global warming and they did this to rush this report
[44:24.680 --> 44:30.680]  because they wanted to make the maximum impact at the UN Climate Conference in Paris in 2015.
[44:30.680 --> 44:36.680]  So this is high-level whistleblower, data science, climate and satellites consultant John J. Bates.
[44:36.680 --> 44:41.680]  He said that America's national oceanic and atmospheric administration
[44:41.680 --> 44:47.680]  breached its own rules on scientific integrity by rushing to push this report through.
[44:47.680 --> 44:52.680]  And this report claimed that this pause or the slowdown in global warming is actually a myth
[44:52.680 --> 44:57.680]  and that world temperatures had been rising faster than science could explain.
[44:57.680 --> 45:00.680]  So again, this is flawed and unsubstantiated data.
[45:00.680 --> 45:04.680]  It was seized upon by world leaders who then took to the streets,
[45:04.680 --> 45:11.680]  blasting it all over media to claim that 97% of scientists say climate change is urgent
[45:11.680 --> 45:14.680]  and it's man-made and it must be addressed.
[45:14.680 --> 45:21.680]  And so immediately with this Paris Accord, they dedicated $100 billion in taxpayer dollars every single year
[45:21.680 --> 45:26.680]  to be given an extra climate-related aid to the developing world by rich nations.
[45:26.680 --> 45:32.680]  And they also called for a binding legal mechanism to ensure that the world got no more
[45:32.680 --> 45:36.680]  than two degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial times.
[45:36.680 --> 45:41.680]  Dr. Bates said that this report was based on misleading and unverified data.
[45:41.680 --> 45:47.680]  He retired from NOAA at the end of last year after a 40-year career there in meteorology and climate science.
[45:47.680 --> 45:53.680]  And in 2014, the Obama administration awarded him a special gold medal for his work
[45:53.680 --> 45:58.680]  in setting new supposedly binding standards to produce and preserve climate data records.
[45:58.680 --> 46:03.680]  So when he's saying that they are misleading and using unverified data here,
[46:03.680 --> 46:06.680]  why he's such a high-level whistleblower, we need to pay attention to this.
[46:06.680 --> 46:11.680]  So this paper is being kind of referred to as the pause-buster paper.
[46:11.680 --> 46:14.680]  And it was based on two new temperature sets of data,
[46:14.680 --> 46:20.680]  one containing measurements of temperatures of the sea and the other at the planet's surface on land.
[46:20.680 --> 46:25.680]  Both data sets were flawed. They haven't even come through with an official revised version yet.
[46:25.680 --> 46:29.680]  Okay, and now it's almost 2017. So typically with the sea data set,
[46:29.680 --> 46:32.680]  they're going to be using readings from fixed and floating buoys.
[46:32.680 --> 46:35.680]  These are generally reliable, but what they did this time,
[46:35.680 --> 46:43.680]  there was an upwards adjustment of these readings to bring them in line with readings from water being taken in by ships.
[46:43.680 --> 46:49.680]  So this is totally doubtful source. Obviously, you think about it, ships themselves are sources of heat.
[46:49.680 --> 46:54.680]  Readings will vary from ship to ship, and the depth of water intake will vary
[46:54.680 --> 46:59.680]  according to how heavily a ship is laden, which means obviously if the ship is in deeper water,
[46:59.680 --> 47:03.680]  it's going to be a colder reading versus warmer reading, etc.
[47:03.680 --> 47:06.680]  So they had this good data from buoys according to Dr. Bates,
[47:06.680 --> 47:10.680]  but they threw that out and corrected it by using the bad data from ships.
[47:10.680 --> 47:14.680]  In addition, they were also using a new experimental program.
[47:14.680 --> 47:19.680]  They were combining separate sets of records, so it was kind of too new.
[47:19.680 --> 47:23.680]  They weren't able to give this the careful checking that was required,
[47:23.680 --> 47:27.680]  but they pushed it out anyway, and then in addition to that,
[47:27.680 --> 47:31.680]  the software that they were using was afflicted by serious bugs.
[47:31.680 --> 47:36.680]  Every time they took in the raw temperature readings, they were running through this computer,
[47:36.680 --> 47:39.680]  it gave different results because it was seriously flawed,
[47:39.680 --> 47:44.680]  and the new bug-free version of the software still has not been approved and issued.
[47:44.680 --> 47:50.680]  And just the clincher here, none of the data on which the paper was based was properly archived,
[47:50.680 --> 47:53.680]  which is a mandatory requirement meant to ensure that the raw data
[47:53.680 --> 47:57.680]  and the software used to process it is accessible to other scientists
[47:57.680 --> 47:59.680]  so they can verify NOAA's results.
[47:59.680 --> 48:06.680]  And Dr. Bates said the final bombshell is that the computer used to process the software suffered a complete failure.
[48:06.680 --> 48:11.680]  So the reason for the failure is unknown, but this means that this pause-buster paper
[48:11.680 --> 48:14.680]  can never be replicated or verified by other scientists,
[48:14.680 --> 48:19.680]  and this is key because this was a paper that was used by President Barack Obama,
[48:19.680 --> 48:23.680]  David Cameron, and other world leaders to push this climate change agenda.
[48:23.680 --> 48:27.680]  They locked us into this agreement, billions of taxpayer dollars.
[48:27.680 --> 48:32.680]  Even after they're out of office, this will ensure that this agenda moves forward.
[48:32.680 --> 48:36.680]  We'll just have to wait and see if President Donald Trump is able to turn this around.
[48:36.680 --> 48:40.680]  Of course, he campaigned on reversing this climate change agenda.
[48:40.680 --> 48:50.680]  That is Leon McAdoo. We're going to break here in a moment and I'm going to come back with all the organized public plans that have now been leaked
[48:50.680 --> 48:53.680]  to censor your truly Matt Drudge and others.
[48:53.680 --> 48:57.680]  So when I say spread the link, spread the video, support the First Amendment,
[48:57.680 --> 49:02.680]  free speeches under attack globally, the Pope has come out and said that alternative news,
[49:02.680 --> 49:06.680]  questioning the government is akin to worshipping feces.
[49:06.680 --> 49:11.680]  Only that could come from his scatological, diseased, anti-Christ brain,
[49:11.680 --> 49:16.680]  who says he's disgusted by Europe's Christian roots and is sick of hearing about it.
[49:16.680 --> 49:21.680]  What a true abomination. What a true anti-Christ sitting in the Vatican and saying,
[49:21.680 --> 49:25.680]  God, good Catholics everywhere are trying to throw off that beast.
[49:25.680 --> 49:27.680]  I salute the Catholics out there.
[49:27.680 --> 49:29.680]  Now, let's continue, ladies and gentlemen.
[49:29.680 --> 49:33.680]  Superblue just came back in. I want to thank you all for your support.
[49:33.680 --> 49:38.680]  It is selling so fast. Last time it sold out in one week,
[49:38.680 --> 49:42.680]  we ordered triple the amount, or a little more than double, actually,
[49:42.680 --> 49:44.680]  when the bubblegum flavor comes in, that'll be triple.
[49:44.680 --> 49:48.680]  And it'll sell out in about two weeks at this rate and we need this to fund ourselves.
[49:48.680 --> 49:52.680]  Plus, it's the best fluoride-free toothpaste out there because it has nano silver,
[49:52.680 --> 49:57.680]  colloidal silver, and true iodine. It doesn't turn red, it turns gray blue.
[49:57.680 --> 50:00.680]  You'll notice that in peppermint and tea tree oil.
[50:00.680 --> 50:03.680]  Now, it's really strong with the essential oils. This is serious toothpaste.
[50:03.680 --> 50:08.680]  It's a big dude. And so some kids don't like it because the peppermint and tea tree oil is so strong.
[50:08.680 --> 50:12.680]  So bubblegum is coming out without the peppermint oil. That should be it in the next month.
[50:12.680 --> 50:18.680]  But right now, we have Superblue designed by my dad, retired dentist and oral surgeon,
[50:18.680 --> 50:24.680]  and of course, chemist as well, and working with the top toothpaste manufacturer of organic toothpaste
[50:24.680 --> 50:27.680]  in the country. This is made in their labs.
[50:27.680 --> 50:32.680]  So I want to thank everybody for their support, InfoWarsLife.com, where you find the supplements,
[50:32.680 --> 50:38.680]  including Superblue, our cultural-free, triple-eight, two-five, three-three-one, three-nine, Superblue.
[50:38.680 --> 50:41.680]  Now, back in stock, the best toothpaste in the world.
[50:41.680 --> 50:46.680]  And it's got five-star reviews on third-party sites because it's that good.
[50:46.680 --> 50:52.680]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen, more on the other side as we take down the corporate world government together.

[54:38.680 --> 54:43.680]  Sister of 1989.
[54:43.680 --> 54:48.680]  Kevin Martin, good to meet you in the flesh.
[54:48.680 --> 54:49.680]  Nice to meet you.
[54:49.680 --> 54:57.680]  Wow, thanks for coming down. I hope we can work with you as either being a correspondent on the East Coast or maybe down here in the Austin operation.
[54:57.680 --> 55:10.680]  But great job. All the videos I've seen around the country really blowing away social justice warriors with us in this segment and the next. And then you're going to be back with us co-hosting when Milo joins us in the third hour.
[55:10.680 --> 55:16.680]  But just, we haven't even talked since you got here. Didn't even run into you this morning. Just out of the gates. What is on your radar?
[55:16.680 --> 55:23.680]  What do you think about what's happening in the world? The media acting like Trump's done something illegal, limited blocking of people from unvetted countries.
[55:23.680 --> 55:30.680]  When the law is clear, he could do it indefinitely. I mean, that's why we elect the president. He's the executive. He's over that to execute the laws.
[55:30.680 --> 55:35.680]  I mean, what do you want to tackle first and what are you going to cover when you join Milo and myself?
[55:35.680 --> 55:39.680]  Well, you know, I think, you know, I appreciate you having me. It's nice to meet you officially.
[55:39.680 --> 55:48.680]  What I honestly think is, is I think that we live in a world, I believe that we live in a world that's very, very divided.
[55:48.680 --> 55:55.680]  And I believe that what previous administration had in mind is that, listen, if we can divide the American people, we can conquer the American people.
[55:55.680 --> 55:56.680]  Let's end the WikiLeaks.
[55:56.680 --> 56:04.680]  Absolutely. And I think it all comes down to a globalist agenda, you know, and I think a lot of people, especially with Donald Trump, he's going to bring us all together.
[56:04.680 --> 56:05.680]  He's brought so many of us together.
[56:05.680 --> 56:09.680]  He does. He first points out they're trying to divide us, but then he truly brings us together.
[56:09.680 --> 56:19.680]  Absolutely. I think that just kind of shows, you know, how, how Donald Trump is his, his main, you know, President Donald Trump, his main goal is to kind of crush that globalist agenda.
[56:19.680 --> 56:25.680]  It's to crush it. And I think that we all need to come together, you know, in unity and love and respect for one another and one fellow Americans.
[56:25.680 --> 56:30.680]  Well, that's what's happening. You know, the media says Alex Jones used to hate both parties, but now he's all in for Trump.
[56:30.680 --> 56:36.680]  Well, you bet, getting us out of the carbon taxes, the Republicans are pushing. It's all one sided. China doesn't have to pay those.
[56:36.680 --> 56:42.680]  India doesn't pay those. You know, made up global warming bull. We've got him trying to bring back, you know, the corporations.
[56:42.680 --> 56:50.680]  We've got him pulling out of TPP. We've got him trying to build a $10 billion wall where the illegals cost over $100 billion a year.
[56:50.680 --> 56:56.680]  I mean, this is simple stuff. I can't go to Mexico and move there without their authorization.
[56:56.680 --> 57:00.680]  Well, somebody should be able to move here from China or anywhere without authorization.
[57:00.680 --> 57:07.680]  You know, and that's exactly right. I mean, that's exactly right. I mean, we see, you know, with our border with Mexico, I mean, you get shot.
[57:07.680 --> 57:15.680]  I mean, you get caught jumping across the Mexican border. I mean, say you want to go to, you know, you want to go to Mexico for, you know, say for a honeymoon or for a vacation or whatever in Cancun.
[57:15.680 --> 57:19.680]  You get caught jumping the border. You're going to get caught. You're going to get extorted. You're going to be held for ransom.
[57:19.680 --> 57:29.680]  You know, we are a nation of laws, you know, and we need to, the rest of the world needs to realize I think a lot of the rest of the world looks at us like, you know, you know, that we're a bunch of jokesters.
[57:29.680 --> 57:34.680]  You know, I mean, I think that, you know, we have to stand for something or we're going to fall for anything.
[57:34.680 --> 57:39.680]  I think a lot of immigrants are coming here, you know, because they not not because they want to make a better life for themselves.
[57:39.680 --> 57:44.680]  The majority wants to come here because they can take advantage of our system and our social programs.
[57:44.680 --> 57:49.680]  Well, definitely the majority of the unskilled. There are a lot of students, other people that come here and I welcome new blood.
[57:49.680 --> 57:57.680]  We need people of every color in every region. I don't want them being brought here and being turned into globalist stuges that are anti-nationalistic.
[57:57.680 --> 58:07.680]  The globalists are using third world populations to flood what's left of the West and the first world to politically lower wages and turn us all into slaves.
[58:07.680 --> 58:12.680]  I want to empower the third world, but I've read the globalist plan and we're here exposing it.
[58:12.680 --> 58:15.680]  Now, what's the best website? KevinMartin.info?
[58:15.680 --> 58:16.680]  KevinMartin.info.
[58:16.680 --> 58:20.680]  There's some amazing videos there. I want to come back and just hear from you because we haven't talked yet in person.
[58:20.680 --> 58:29.680]  I just once on Skype and I'm like, I know you're watching a lot of your videos about if you did come to work at Info Wars, what you'd like to work on and what your vision is.
[58:29.680 --> 58:35.680]  We're expanding the fight against the globalist and we're going to defeat them. Stay with us. Our number two, 70 seconds away.
[58:35.680 --> 58:45.680]  You are listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:45.680 --> 58:56.680]  Radiation in Fukushima has reached unprecedented levels. News has been breaking for days now that radiation levels inside the damaged nuclear reactor are at their highest point since the meltdown in 2011.
[58:56.680 --> 59:07.680]  Tokyo Electric Power, or TEPCO, has said that readings as high as 530 sieverts an hour have been recorded inside of nuclear reactor number two, one of the three failing reactors, that's 100 times the fatal level.
[59:07.680 --> 59:13.680]  This increase is quite alarming considering the previous high was 73 sieverts an hour, a 700% increase.
[59:13.680 --> 59:18.680]  The hypothesis for the increased levels at this point is that nuclear fuel melted a hole through a containment vessel.
[59:18.680 --> 59:26.680]  These increased levels of radiation will make cleanup even more difficult considering the most advanced robot for the assignment can only last two hours in the atmosphere before failing.
[59:26.680 --> 59:33.680]  Estimated cost of cleanup, if possible, is said to have doubled, but let's be honest, the cost of this is immeasurable.
[59:33.680 --> 59:36.680]  This meltdown has already severely crippled marine life in the Pacific Ocean.
[59:36.680 --> 59:43.680]  The protesters in the mainstream news are still silent on this issue. This is Owen Schreuer for Infowars.com.
[1:00:07.680 --> 1:00:16.680]  Before America can be great again, she must be free again. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:20.680 --> 1:00:26.680]  You know, I don't want to hire five, six, seven more reporters. I don't want to hire more editors and researchers and investigative journalists.
[1:00:26.680 --> 1:00:31.680]  But, you know, there's a need. There's a vacuum that needs to be filled. We're going to do it.
[1:00:31.680 --> 1:00:36.680]  And so that's what Infowars is doing. And I'm going to talk to Kevin, who's here a few days.
[1:00:36.680 --> 1:00:41.680]  Kevin Martin, who's just, you know, a great young man and a great journalist out there on the streets.
[1:00:41.680 --> 1:00:47.680]  You know, what he thinks he would do with Infowars because I'm looking to hire more people and we're bringing more folks in.
[1:00:47.680 --> 1:00:52.680]  And we don't have a big budget, but we're able to do this because you've been supporting us out there.
[1:00:52.680 --> 1:00:56.680]  You're going to be back later in the third hour with Milo co-hosting with us and popping in.
[1:00:56.680 --> 1:00:59.680]  But what would your vision be if you came to work at Infowars?
[1:00:59.680 --> 1:01:05.680]  Well, Alex, you know, my vision would be, you know, just kind of bring attention to what a lot of people don't like to bring attention to.
[1:01:05.680 --> 1:01:15.680]  And that's problems that are rooted in and embedded in different communities, you know, especially, you know, the African-American community and, you know, the immigrant community.
[1:01:15.680 --> 1:01:21.680]  And communities that are able to be very, very beneficial to society.
[1:01:21.680 --> 1:01:28.680]  But I feel like, you know, so many communities, especially for me, you know, in the African-American community, there's so many problems there.
[1:01:28.680 --> 1:01:30.680]  And there's so many broken homes and broken families.
[1:01:30.680 --> 1:01:32.680]  And it's called the Great Society.
[1:01:32.680 --> 1:01:40.680]  It is. And I feel like so many of those problems, you know, aren't addressed because there's certain people that, you know, you know, the African-American leaders.
[1:01:40.680 --> 1:01:45.680]  I mean, it's hard to address issues like that without getting, you know, death threats and backlash.
[1:01:45.680 --> 1:01:52.680]  Because I believe the globalists don't want those issues to be brought to light.
[1:01:52.680 --> 1:02:05.680]  I bet you've read Margaret Sanger's writings that the Democrats planned all this whole plan out to take over the African-American community, to kick fathers out, and then to basically reduce the population, which they've done more than half the black babies never get born.
[1:02:05.680 --> 1:02:14.680]  They have, yeah. And Alex, and just to piggyback, you know, off of what you said there, I mean, 75% of African-American households don't have a father.
[1:02:14.680 --> 1:02:27.680]  They have a daddy, but there's no father. And 95% of those father figures are in the system, the criminal justice system. 98% are in jail, in and out of jail.
[1:02:27.680 --> 1:02:37.680]  I've talked to high-level people that were at MTV in the mid-90s, and they said, listen, we don't care if you're number one, and people want rock and roll, and people want stuff that brings people together, or even hip-hop that was unifying then.
[1:02:37.680 --> 1:02:47.680]  And in the 80s as well, they said, we want gangster rap. That's what Sumner Redstone wants, and it got a whole generation to brand themselves as thugs and destroy all that culture that was there before.
[1:02:47.680 --> 1:02:56.680]  Because my dad was growing up, he said the black folks he knew dressed sharper than the white people, and I'm not defending segregation, but had their own businesses, their own hotels, their own power.
[1:02:56.680 --> 1:03:08.680]  And that's what really Jim Crow and everybody was actually worried about, was because they tried to suppress black people. They'd only made them stronger, but by quote, bringing the government in to help them was actually a sabotaged Trojan horse.
[1:03:08.680 --> 1:03:11.680]  So one evil was replaced with another.
[1:03:11.680 --> 1:03:28.680]  Absolutely, and you see that so much. And I think a lot of people, especially with President Donald Trump, and he's reached out to people to tap people's minds and how he can bring people together, and I say, listen, it's not about victimizing the African-American community, it's about giving good, solid information.
[1:03:28.680 --> 1:03:45.680]  So that way they can have a vision like, look, just because the color of my skin is darker, or just because I look different, doesn't mean I'm any less than a person. And I think it's the Democrats that have made, especially the African-American community, feel that way in victimizing.
[1:03:45.680 --> 1:04:01.680]  Take Black Lives Matter. How could you get a group of people to demonize themselves more and then have a cop killing movement led by a bunch of white people who can find a few black people to do to demonize black people, to make white people become racist and hate you, and then make blacks run more into the racist leadership.
[1:04:01.680 --> 1:04:06.680]  They've got, it's a social engineering program, and we even have their WikiLeaks. We have them. It's a plan.
[1:04:06.680 --> 1:04:07.680]  It's there.
[1:04:07.680 --> 1:04:08.680]  Is that not sick, though?
[1:04:08.680 --> 1:04:12.680]  It is. It is. It's really, really, really sad. It's really, really sad.
[1:04:12.680 --> 1:04:22.680]  Well, I hope you wouldn't be able to work with this on that subject and a lot of others, and just break the back of this, because I'm telling you, people across the board, no matter what color they are, they're ready to come out of bondage.
[1:04:22.680 --> 1:04:33.680]  Absolutely. And I see that all the time. And I've, you know, I was just down there. You've seen that video where I was speaking with that one, that Black Lives Matter, that white lady that was down there doing the Black Lives Matter protest, talking about Lock Donald Trump.
[1:04:33.680 --> 1:04:43.680]  And I just, you know, I just dropped, you know, I just was good, honest information, and I was giving her, like, look, you know, the African-American community, you know, we're killing each other, you know, at the alarming rate, the biggest.
[1:04:43.680 --> 1:04:48.680]  4,000 people, 90-plus percent black, shot in Chicago last year.
[1:04:48.680 --> 1:04:54.680]  And to Democrat run, again, city. We'll talk about this more with Milo coming up. Good to have you here, my friend.
[1:04:54.680 --> 1:04:55.680]  Good to be here.
[1:04:55.680 --> 1:05:06.680]  Radiation in Fukushima has reached unprecedented levels. News has been breaking for days now that radiation levels inside the damaged nuclear reactor are at their highest point since the meltdown in 2011.
[1:05:06.680 --> 1:05:17.680]  Tokyo Electric Power, or TEPCO, has said that readings as high as 530 seabirds an hour have been recorded inside of nuclear reactor number two, one of the three failing reactors, that's 100 times the fatal level.
[1:05:17.680 --> 1:05:28.680]  This increase is quite alarming, considering the previous high was 73 seabirds an hour, a 700 percent increase. The hypothesis for the increased levels at this point is that nuclear fuel melted a hole through a containment vessel.
[1:05:28.680 --> 1:05:36.680]  These increased levels of radiation will make cleanup even more difficult, considering the most advanced robot for the assignment can only last two hours in the atmosphere before failing.
[1:05:36.680 --> 1:05:42.680]  Estimated cost of cleanup, if possible, is said to have doubled, but let's be honest, the cost of this is immeasurable.
[1:05:42.680 --> 1:05:52.680]  This meltdown has already severely crippled marine life in the Pacific Ocean. The protesters in the mainstream news are still silent on this issue. This is Owen Schreuer for Infowars.com.
[1:06:13.680 --> 1:06:20.680]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[1:06:20.680 --> 1:06:30.680]  If you are dealing with a health challenge, or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives,

[1:07:57.680 --> 1:08:04.680]  These arrogant globalists thought they defeated humanity. The truth is, whether it's Obama or George Soros, they're losers.
[1:08:04.680 --> 1:08:08.680]  Everything they had, everything they threw against us, failed.
[1:08:08.680 --> 1:08:18.680]  Now, just because we defeated these tyrants for now doesn't mean we've won the war. The war has happened within our hearts, within our souls, within our minds.
[1:08:18.680 --> 1:08:32.680]  We have to be good. We have to be pure. We have to be strong. We have to build prosperity. We have to bring everyone of every race, color, and creed together if we're going to truly defeat these tyrants who believed we were going to fail,
[1:08:32.680 --> 1:08:43.680]  who believed their divide and conquer would work. Yes, we've won the first phase, but the battle for the soul of humanity has just begun.
[1:08:43.680 --> 1:09:03.680]  But, Obama and Hillary and Soros, he were losers from the day you were born.
[1:09:03.680 --> 1:09:17.680]  This is the heart of 1776. Get a white male! It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones. Move, bitch! Get out of the way!
[1:09:17.680 --> 1:09:28.680]  We pledge allegiance to one flag, and that flag is the American flag. Infowars helped fuel the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[1:09:28.680 --> 1:09:38.680]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning. I will not let you down. You'll be very, very impressed, I hope, and I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[1:09:38.680 --> 1:09:46.680]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones. This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[1:09:46.680 --> 1:09:51.680]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones.
[1:09:51.680 --> 1:09:59.680]  The battle for the Republic rages on. The battle for national sovereignty and free human determination across the planet is accelerating.
[1:09:59.680 --> 1:10:10.680]  Thank you for joining us on this live Wednesday global transmission. It is already the eighth day. Hard to believe, the eighth day of February 2017.
[1:10:10.680 --> 1:10:21.680]  You know, I thought of somebody last week and this week when Trump came out and said, why won't the media cover the Islamic terror properly?
[1:10:21.680 --> 1:10:29.680]  And he visited, of course, just a few days ago, the Central Command in Florida.
[1:10:29.680 --> 1:10:41.680]  And he said, I think we all know why they won't. And that's because they've been ordered in the military, but also in customs, the CIA, you name it, in memos that have been released.
[1:10:41.680 --> 1:10:55.680]  That you will not even say Islamic terror exists, and you will not even ask someone if they are in Islamic jihad, Hezbollah, Hamas, al-Qaeda, ISIS, al-Nazra, you name it.
[1:10:55.680 --> 1:11:01.680]  So we hear there's extreme vetting. They're not allowed to ask them.
[1:11:01.680 --> 1:11:09.680]  Now, I read his book when it came out a few years ago and everybody should get up. Philip Haney has a lot of courage because whistleblowers have been persecuted under Obama.
[1:11:09.680 --> 1:11:13.680]  Now they're going to be praised. You watch under Trump.
[1:11:13.680 --> 1:11:25.680]  He studied Arabic culture language while working as a scientist in the Middle East before he was hired as a founding member of the Department of Homeland Security 2003, becoming an armed customs and board patrol officer.
[1:11:25.680 --> 1:11:33.680]  He served several tours of duty in the National Targeting Center near Washington, D.C., where he quickly was promoted to advanced training team, an unprecedented accomplishment for an agent on temporary duty assignment.
[1:11:33.680 --> 1:11:35.680]  He did it because he was a patriot.
[1:11:35.680 --> 1:11:45.680]  The officer Haney won numerous awards and commendations from his superiors and meticulously compiling information and producing accountable reports that led to the identification of hundreds of terrorists.
[1:11:45.680 --> 1:11:50.680]  He has specialized in Islamic theology and strategic and tactics of the global Islamic movement.
[1:11:50.680 --> 1:11:57.680]  He retired honorably in 2015 to be able to obviously write his book, See Something, Say Nothing.
[1:11:57.680 --> 1:12:09.680]  And I think about the CIA whistleblowers we've had on by name, those we haven't. When I think about Colonel Schaefer, who ran the anti-Al Qaeda operations, who was ordered to stand down.
[1:12:09.680 --> 1:12:21.680]  When I think about the people that ran Stratus Ivy and Abel Danger that have exposed it, when I think about the sources I have, some of them that are generals, above major generals,
[1:12:21.680 --> 1:12:28.680]  who, of course, leaked the info five years ago that our government under Obama was funding Al Qaeda and ISIS.
[1:12:28.680 --> 1:12:32.680]  And then you saw Senator Cruz and Senator Paul come out and say, this is wrong.
[1:12:32.680 --> 1:12:36.680]  And then the Joint Chiefs went and visited Obama and said, we will not be part of this.
[1:12:36.680 --> 1:12:41.680]  And that was the beginning of the collapse of this Arab Spring being funded by Saudi Arabia and NATO.
[1:12:41.680 --> 1:12:56.680]  So we've had from CIA contractors on the ground like Tosh Plumlee, right up to people in NATO in the boardrooms where they were planning to give them the weapons at Benghazi to then invade Syria.
[1:12:56.680 --> 1:13:09.680]  So we know. I've talked to multiple people on air and off air who were there when the Secretary of State Clinton was on the horn saying, you will turn those troop carriers back.
[1:13:09.680 --> 1:13:13.680]  That had troops going in to give relief during those 13 hours.
[1:13:13.680 --> 1:13:15.680]  So that's where they went too far.
[1:13:15.680 --> 1:13:23.680]  There's thousands of people in situation rooms in all four branches and in Central Command and in South Com and in North Com and in Space Command.
[1:13:23.680 --> 1:13:32.680]  And everywhere else, they all watched it go down for at least eight hours of stand-down orders four times.
[1:13:32.680 --> 1:13:37.680]  And their whole op got blown to turn the Islamic jihad loose worldwide, flood Europe, you name it.
[1:13:37.680 --> 1:13:39.680]  Now they got halfway through their plan.
[1:13:39.680 --> 1:13:43.680]  But I look at the media going, how ridiculous.
[1:13:43.680 --> 1:13:45.680]  We're going to our guests in a moment.
[1:13:45.680 --> 1:13:46.680]  How ridiculous?
[1:13:46.680 --> 1:13:50.680]  They say there's IRS, 18,000 IRS to penalize you under Obamacare.
[1:13:50.680 --> 1:13:51.680]  Obamacare is free.
[1:13:51.680 --> 1:13:53.680]  There's no IRS was in the bill.
[1:13:53.680 --> 1:13:55.680]  Now you've been penalized.
[1:13:55.680 --> 1:13:59.680]  Now the $5,000 fine start this year, not the 2,000.
[1:13:59.680 --> 1:14:03.680]  And just like that, they say, it's insane.
[1:14:03.680 --> 1:14:06.680]  We reported on almost all the 70 plus events.
[1:14:06.680 --> 1:14:08.680]  Yeah, you'd mention them once or twice and move on.
[1:14:08.680 --> 1:14:12.680]  Or if a mosque gets attacked by other Muslims, you call it an attack on Muslims.
[1:14:12.680 --> 1:14:13.680]  I'm not out to get Muslims themselves.
[1:14:13.680 --> 1:14:17.680]  Most Muslims want to be heretics and don't want to be under extreme Wahhabism.
[1:14:17.680 --> 1:14:25.680]  But that's the form of Islam is taking control of Sunni Islam that is 80% of Islam globally and a billion people.
[1:14:25.680 --> 1:14:28.680]  There's a billion Sunnis.
[1:14:28.680 --> 1:14:31.680]  And they're the ones invading 30 plus countries right now.
[1:14:31.680 --> 1:14:33.680]  They're the ones attacking shopping malls.
[1:14:33.680 --> 1:14:35.680]  They're the ones attacking gay bars.
[1:14:35.680 --> 1:14:37.680]  They're the ones throwing gays off buildings.
[1:14:37.680 --> 1:14:39.680]  They're the ones pouring acid on women's faces.
[1:14:39.680 --> 1:14:43.680]  You take your spiegel with an image of Trump cutting the head off of Statue of Liberty.
[1:14:43.680 --> 1:14:49.680]  And saying America first, the idea of us having sovereignty is murdering liberty and murdering.
[1:14:49.680 --> 1:14:54.680]  No, I'm not going to show you the endless footage of them chopping men and women's heads off and children's heads off.
[1:14:54.680 --> 1:14:57.680]  But I will show you women who had acid poured on their faces.
[1:14:57.680 --> 1:14:58.680]  Let's show TV viewers.
[1:14:58.680 --> 1:15:00.680]  Radio listeners, go Google it for yourself.
[1:15:00.680 --> 1:15:03.680]  Yeah, yeah, there's your beauty right there.
[1:15:03.680 --> 1:15:06.680]  These are the nameless faceless people that don't count.
[1:15:06.680 --> 1:15:08.680]  The women's march two weeks ago in DC.
[1:15:08.680 --> 1:15:11.680]  I was there was led by the Islamic jihad.
[1:15:11.680 --> 1:15:13.680]  I couldn't believe it.
[1:15:13.680 --> 1:15:21.680]  Women chanting Allah Akbar from Germany to the United States in the weird cuckold.
[1:15:21.680 --> 1:15:26.680]  I don't know what you call it learn helplessness Stockholm syndrome.
[1:15:26.680 --> 1:15:31.680]  Declaring the West is anti woman when it's the birthplace of women's freedom.
[1:15:31.680 --> 1:15:34.680]  Whether on the equivalent of a pink pillow worshiped.
[1:15:34.680 --> 1:15:41.680]  The whole West is about the goddess ethos versus Islam, the most monotheistic anti female religion on earth.
[1:15:41.680 --> 1:15:46.680]  If you love women, it is the virtual religion of Satan.
[1:15:46.680 --> 1:15:49.680]  But the glorious dinams are on their knees before it.
[1:15:49.680 --> 1:15:52.680]  Well, Gloria Stein was funded by the leftist CIA arm.
[1:15:52.680 --> 1:15:53.680]  That's all declassified.
[1:15:53.680 --> 1:16:00.680]  So our guest documenting the truth of the under reporting of Islamic attacks where they weren't even allowed to call it.
[1:16:00.680 --> 1:16:03.680]  Islamic attacks and they go Trump's crazy.
[1:16:03.680 --> 1:16:09.680]  Here's the Washington Post info wars is behind President Trump's idea that the media is covering up terrorist attacks.
[1:16:09.680 --> 1:16:13.680]  Back like we're discredited when we're the cutting edge.
[1:16:13.680 --> 1:16:16.680]  Oh, I gotta tell you, I guess so many people we reached out last week.
[1:16:16.680 --> 1:16:17.680]  We have a new record.
[1:16:17.680 --> 1:16:19.680]  It was not 85 million like the election week.
[1:16:19.680 --> 1:16:20.680]  Guess what we hit last week?
[1:16:20.680 --> 1:16:22.680]  Normal weeks 40 something mill.
[1:16:22.680 --> 1:16:24.680]  Guess what we hit last week?
[1:16:24.680 --> 1:16:27.680]  89 million people that were able to track.
[1:16:27.680 --> 1:16:31.680]  89 million.
[1:16:31.680 --> 1:16:37.680]  If you count the Joe Rogan podcast, the number one podcast in iTunes history and they won't even list it.
[1:16:37.680 --> 1:16:38.680]  I talked to Joe two days ago.
[1:16:38.680 --> 1:16:40.680]  He said, it's incredible.
[1:16:40.680 --> 1:16:43.680]  Host of the UFC movie star, TV star, everything.
[1:16:43.680 --> 1:16:46.680]  Number one, he's able to look at it in the in the back end.
[1:16:46.680 --> 1:16:49.680]  It should be the number one podcast of all time.
[1:16:49.680 --> 1:16:54.680]  It's not even listed in the top ones, but it doesn't matter.
[1:16:54.680 --> 1:16:58.680]  We're still number one.
[1:16:58.680 --> 1:17:00.680]  And that's because the people want truth.
[1:17:00.680 --> 1:17:01.680]  I'm going to skip this break.
[1:17:01.680 --> 1:17:02.680]  So I guess there's more time.
[1:17:02.680 --> 1:17:03.680]  Philip Haney get his book.
[1:17:03.680 --> 1:17:04.680]  See something say nothing.
[1:17:04.680 --> 1:17:08.680]  So we see this claim when he was ordered and has released the documents.
[1:17:08.680 --> 1:17:09.680]  But you saw the news.
[1:17:09.680 --> 1:17:11.680]  Don't you call it Islamic terror?
[1:17:11.680 --> 1:17:14.680]  There's no such thing as Islamic terror.
[1:17:14.680 --> 1:17:17.680]  And then now they didn't just cover up the terror attacks and whitewash him and play him.
[1:17:17.680 --> 1:17:20.680]  Now they covered up that they were Islamic to begin with.
[1:17:20.680 --> 1:17:26.680]  As usual, it's worse than what that amazing president is saying.
[1:17:26.680 --> 1:17:29.680]  How he read the law today on air.
[1:17:29.680 --> 1:17:31.680]  He could block everybody if you wanted to.
[1:17:31.680 --> 1:17:36.680]  He's the president under the law that four other presidents have used.
[1:17:36.680 --> 1:17:40.680]  So an expert on this, one of the main trainers, one of their main intelligence researchers.
[1:17:40.680 --> 1:17:44.680]  And if you don't think customs doesn't have intelligence, it dials into all the agencies.
[1:17:44.680 --> 1:17:46.680]  It's at the national security director level.
[1:17:46.680 --> 1:17:48.680]  And Philip Haney joins us.
[1:17:48.680 --> 1:17:49.680]  Thank you for coming on, sir.
[1:17:49.680 --> 1:17:53.680]  I gave you that background rant there because this is just an incredible time to be alive.
[1:17:53.680 --> 1:17:57.680]  And you're a very important patriot who sacrificed a lot to tell the truth.
[1:17:57.680 --> 1:17:58.680]  So God bless you.
[1:17:58.680 --> 1:18:03.680]  Please tell us exactly your expert view on what's currently happening and if President Trump is accurate.
[1:18:03.680 --> 1:18:05.680]  He's very accurate.
[1:18:05.680 --> 1:18:15.680]  18 USC 1182 gives the president specific authority to do exactly what he did in the executive order.
[1:18:15.680 --> 1:18:21.680]  There are other provisions in the INA code, the immigration nationalization authority code.
[1:18:21.680 --> 1:18:25.680]  As you said earlier, precedent with four different presidents.
[1:18:25.680 --> 1:18:35.680]  He doesn't have to do anything but follow the law that's already in the books to protect our country from threat both foreign and domestic.
[1:18:35.680 --> 1:18:46.680]  Can you imagine trying to operate encounter intelligence under a regime that we saw a little glimpse of today, the last few days with the judges.
[1:18:46.680 --> 1:18:55.680]  How they rule with complete disregard of obvious constitutional and immigration law and make up provisions and rulings.
[1:18:55.680 --> 1:18:57.680]  They're basically directives.
[1:18:57.680 --> 1:19:06.680]  Can you imagine trying to conduct and protect our country under that kind of imposition of politically correct.
[1:19:06.680 --> 1:19:08.680]  Beyond handcuffs, it's blinders.
[1:19:08.680 --> 1:19:12.680]  Both handcuff and blinder.
[1:19:12.680 --> 1:19:15.680]  Let's walk through this because you're a key whistleblower that helped bring all this out.
[1:19:15.680 --> 1:19:20.680]  The directives cannot even be able to ask questions.
[1:19:20.680 --> 1:19:32.680]  Well, that started in 2008 with a memo called the words matter memo that was brought up through the civil rights and civil liberties branch of the Department of Homeland Security.
[1:19:32.680 --> 1:19:46.680]  They asked subject matter experts like myself internally before the memo was released in January of 2008 for their our opinion about what these directives that were embedded within the memo would actually mean.
[1:19:46.680 --> 1:20:02.680]  These would be counter terrorism. I give them seven points to consider in terms of the harm that would do to our efforts to call the enemy and use the terms that they themselves use 100,000 times every day.
[1:20:02.680 --> 1:20:05.680]  And those comments were ignored.
[1:20:05.680 --> 1:20:11.680]  And it went into policy and it morphed into what we know of today is countering violent extremism.
[1:20:11.680 --> 1:20:20.680]  Where we were basically told that if we name the enemy, it will offend people in Muslim countries and put us at greater risk.
[1:20:20.680 --> 1:20:28.680]  Which is if you think about it, they're basically saying if we don't do what they want, they will kill us.
[1:20:28.680 --> 1:20:31.680]  And that's really the debate with the immigration issue.
[1:20:31.680 --> 1:20:41.680]  They're telling us that we don't have the right to protect our borders, that we don't have the sovereign authority to put American citizens.
[1:20:41.680 --> 1:20:52.680]  Keep them from harm. And then if we do exercise our constitutional and sovereign rights, they call us nationalists, racist, bigots, Islamophobes.
[1:20:52.680 --> 1:20:57.680]  This is a really incredibly important moment we are in history.
[1:20:57.680 --> 1:21:02.680]  President Trump has to win this battle, even if it goes to the Supreme Court.
[1:21:02.680 --> 1:21:13.680]  Because if we allow judges to overrule case law and immigration law, we will descend into anarchy and chaos.
[1:21:13.680 --> 1:21:19.680]  Well, I just love how they sit there with a straight face and say, whoa, fascism, nobody's ever done this.
[1:21:19.680 --> 1:21:22.680]  When they know Jimmy Carter Reagan, right through to him did it.
[1:21:22.680 --> 1:21:27.680]  Sometimes they bobbed the countries. Sometimes they had larger lists.
[1:21:27.680 --> 1:21:35.680]  I mean, clearly Somalia is a totally failed state that still sells women on slave blocks, sedans running a war, decades long war against the Christians in the south.
[1:21:35.680 --> 1:21:38.680]  The only airports there are military bases to attack people.
[1:21:38.680 --> 1:21:42.680]  They're projecting force into the middle of Africa and into Kenya.
[1:21:42.680 --> 1:21:49.680]  I mean, the countries that they've banned are openly declaring how they want to blow the United States and Israel off the face of the world.
[1:21:49.680 --> 1:21:55.680]  Libya is a failed state thanks to Hillary Clinton and Obama against Yemen.
[1:21:55.680 --> 1:21:58.680]  Iraq is a huge war zone. Syria is a war zone.
[1:21:58.680 --> 1:22:05.680]  Who in their right mind would take people from war zones with these flimsy, admittedly fake passports, even the EU?
[1:22:05.680 --> 1:22:13.680]  Interpol, I saw last year said upwards of half the passports that they see coming out of Syria are fake.
[1:22:13.680 --> 1:22:17.680]  Well, that was going to be my next point. I'm glad you brought that up.
[1:22:17.680 --> 1:22:25.680]  Aside from all the other arguments, every one of these countries is in chaos administratively.
[1:22:25.680 --> 1:22:34.680]  On the one hand, they tell us, for example, when they come from Somalia, that they don't even know when they were born, that all of their records have been lost.
[1:22:34.680 --> 1:22:49.680]  Yet on the other hand, they're trying to reassure us that they do robust thorough betting and that we can trust that the paperwork, meaning the visas and the passports that are coming from these countries are legitimate.
[1:22:49.680 --> 1:22:53.680]  So how do we know that? We have to take it on faith.
[1:22:53.680 --> 1:23:08.680]  And anybody in Customs and Border Protection that does what we call work the line and actually processes passengers every day, or who works in what we call secondary, that does more detailed interviews with people coming from these countries,
[1:23:08.680 --> 1:23:17.680]  can tell you that visa fraud and passport fraud is a major problem in our system today.
[1:23:17.680 --> 1:23:23.680]  Well, I mean, quite frankly, I can't believe Obama didn't block these countries that are all in civil war that he helped start.
[1:23:23.680 --> 1:23:35.680]  Nobody lets people into their country from civil wars, especially when a large percentage of the population are foaming at the mouth of jihadis, frothing like pit bull piranhas to tear our throats out.
[1:23:35.680 --> 1:23:50.680]  Well, if he if he blocked them, then he'd have to admit that there was a problem there. And that would contradict the narrative that we've been hearing that he his policies in the Middle East have made us safer.
[1:23:50.680 --> 1:24:03.680]  Didn't we hear that? Didn't he give a speech before the military and say that we're safe as it's ever been, even though every military analyst, this is one thing people are unified on says the world's in the greatest danger it's ever been.
[1:24:03.680 --> 1:24:22.680]  So if he comes in publicly acknowledges that he should block immigration or travel, at least without a more thorough line of questioning at the primary when we come when they come into the airport, it would be by default admitting that perhaps there's a flaw in his foreign policy.
[1:24:22.680 --> 1:24:35.680]  Sure. Philip, honey, let's talk about your book in context to President Trump. I mean, I've read the law, you've read the law, but you're an expert at it. But I mean, again, for me, a five or six year old could figure out what this is saying.
[1:24:35.680 --> 1:24:50.680]  These judges are all acting like it's outrageous what he's done. But quite frankly, shouldn't he do more? I mean, 87% of these people can still come in. A lot of them are absolutely sworn to not adopt our culture and say that they're, you know, absolutely opposed to it.
[1:24:50.680 --> 1:24:59.680]  So my problem with Trump is this isn't strong enough. The way I read the law, he has basically complete control who can come in.
[1:24:59.680 --> 1:25:18.680]  Yes, he does. And then you may remember when DHS was founded in March of 2003, we were called the first line of defense at the border. We actually were given more authority inside the border, like at the airports and seaports and CIA and FBI combined.
[1:25:18.680 --> 1:25:27.680]  Sure, I knew that because you have the actual constitutional prerogative. So it's really the only place the federal government has that power outside the inside the country inside the country.
[1:25:27.680 --> 1:25:42.680]  If we were allowed to exercise that authority when we interview foreign nationals seeking entry and as the formal term, they seek entry. If you have a visa, it doesn't mean that you're automatically admitted to the country.
[1:25:42.680 --> 1:25:55.680]  The State Department issues visas, customs and border protection is supposed to interview the people when they come to the port of entry and determine whether there are reasons to prevent them from coming into the country.
[1:25:55.680 --> 1:26:10.680]  Let's raise this like, I mean, forget Islamic jihad for a minute. What about disease? I've interviewed board patrol union heads. We've been there. I heard this years before it was even in the LA Times. They had to admit it. TB, bubonic plague, leprosy, shabies, all sorts of other bizarre stuff.
[1:26:10.680 --> 1:26:20.680]  When they know they've got something, they're still ordered to let them in and then just cut them loose. What do you think Obama was thinking there?
[1:26:20.680 --> 1:26:33.680]  Well, I believe that his ideological goals and those who are allies with him supersede any of the concerns we might have about national security, including terrorism attacks and or disease.
[1:26:33.680 --> 1:26:46.680]  Because to them, the goal of opening the borders of United States and letting people in from all over the world is more important than any of the possible threat that they might pose.
[1:26:46.680 --> 1:27:01.680]  It's like an equation. On the one side of the equation, you have concern for the political agenda. On the other side of the equation, you have fear of terrorist attacks or concern about terrorist attacks.
[1:27:01.680 --> 1:27:06.680]  And I'll leave it to your audience to put in the mathematical symbol between those two equations.
[1:27:06.680 --> 1:27:22.680]  Was the Obama administration more, less, or equally concerned about political agenda than they were attack? I think it's pretty clear they were more concerned about the political agenda than they were the threat of an attack.
[1:27:22.680 --> 1:27:38.680]  Well, I would agree with you, Philip Haney, but I think it was beyond that. They just didn't even care and were so arrogant they thought the media could label it something else and actually use terror attacks to take our guns. That's what they did. They said, oh, we'll just use jihad attacks with guns so they can get guns here against the Second Amendment.
[1:27:38.680 --> 1:27:57.680]  This is going to be wonderful. We're going to have our cake and eat it too, but it didn't go that way. The American people saw through it. And again, you're the best-selling author of See Something, Say Nothing, the book Inside is an intelligence officer leading people, training people, and one of the top awarded folks in there actually catching terrorists coming in.
[1:27:57.680 --> 1:28:13.680]  Let's talk about then, I know you can't get into some classified areas that you actually witnessed, but some of the type of things you had to witness under the new policies, people that I know you still know that are inside, what it was like under Obama to have to let these people in and where you see this all going.
[1:28:13.680 --> 1:28:29.680]  Well, your premise about mischaracterizing terrorist attacks is not just a vague statement or a theory. It happened in Technicolor with the San Bernardino attack. You might recall that it was characterized initially as a gun issue.
[1:28:29.680 --> 1:28:53.680]  Remember about controlling guns, and it was only days or even in some cases weeks later that all the details of the case actually finally came out. And we found out that Syed Farouk and his wife, Toshvin Malik, were actually part of a network of affiliated organizations right here in the United States that preach openly Sharia supremacy,
[1:28:53.680 --> 1:29:05.680]  implementation of Sharia at the cost or conflict with the Constitution, up to and including the use of jihad attacks or violent attacks in order to push that program forward.
[1:29:05.680 --> 1:29:23.680]  That network has been operating in the United States for 15 or 20 years. And that's why I came forward. And I talked about this group called Top League of Juman because the government shut the case down. It had direct bearing on the San Bernardino case.
[1:29:23.680 --> 1:29:37.680]  Philip Haney, let's talk about that when we come back. Philip Haney, an American hero, folks, had to leave his profession just so he could write the book and tell the truth. He needed to get the book, see something, say nothing. This is all just backing up what Trump said. See how it's worse than the president's saying?
[1:29:37.680 --> 1:29:44.680]  That's what's so scary about Trump is he's so good. I've never even seen anything like this. It's like he's so good.
[1:29:44.680 --> 1:29:54.680]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[1:30:20.680 --> 1:30:27.680]  You said when you talk to people that have been using this actually testing it for years, people that currently are testing it for us, they didn't just say outstanding. What did they really say about them?
[1:30:27.680 --> 1:30:33.680]  They want to know, how do they get it? Where do they find it? A lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing.
[1:30:33.680 --> 1:30:37.680]  The backpack body armor is only $200.
[1:30:37.680 --> 1:30:42.680]  I mean, it's unbelievable. It's a quarter inch thick. It's got a 20-year warranty. It's waterproof. You can wear it. It's comfortable.

[1:32:55.680 --> 1:33:06.680]  Resistance to Pirants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[1:33:06.680 --> 1:33:15.680]  You can run on for a long time. Run on for a long time. Run on for a long time.
[1:33:15.680 --> 1:33:36.680]  I'm going to read what's in dispute. What's in question. And you'll see this. It's INA 212F 8 USC 1182F. Suspension of entry or imposition of restrictions by the president.
[1:33:36.680 --> 1:33:46.680]  This isn't just me. This is for Obama, for Ronald Reagan, for the president. And this was done, very importantly, for security.
[1:33:46.680 --> 1:33:56.680]  Something you people know more about than all of us. It was done for the security of our nation. The security of our citizens.
[1:33:56.680 --> 1:34:07.680]  So that people come in who aren't going to do us harm. And that's why it was done. And it couldn't have been written any more precisely.
[1:34:07.680 --> 1:34:16.680]  It's not like, oh gee, we wish it were written better. It was written beautifully. So just listen. Here's what it says. This is what they were arguing.
[1:34:16.680 --> 1:34:37.680]  Whenever the president finds that the entry of any aliens, okay, the entry, the entry of any aliens, or of any class of aliens, so any aliens, any class of aliens, into the United States.
[1:34:37.680 --> 1:34:46.680]  So the entry of people into the United States, let's say just to be precise, of aliens into the United States.
[1:34:46.680 --> 1:35:02.680]  So any time whenever the president finds that the entry of any alien or any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, right?
[1:35:02.680 --> 1:35:23.680]  So if I find as president that a person or a group of people will be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and certainly there's lots of examples that we have, but you shouldn't even have them necessarily.
[1:35:23.680 --> 1:35:40.680]  He may be, and he may, by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary. Now the only mistake is they should have said he or she, but hopefully it won't be a she for at least another seven years.
[1:35:40.680 --> 1:35:55.680]  That's a good one. I just noticed that actually. I'm saying, whoa, this is not politically correct. It's correct, but it's not politically correct. It's the old days.
[1:35:55.680 --> 1:36:12.680]  He may, by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary. So here it is, people coming in, suspend the entry of all aliens, right?
[1:36:12.680 --> 1:36:27.680]  It's what it says. It's not like, again, a bad high school student would understand this. Anybody would understand this. Suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or non-immigrants.
[1:36:27.680 --> 1:36:47.680]  Or impose on the entry of aliens. So you can suspend the aliens, right? You can suspend the aliens from coming in. Very strong. Or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.
[1:36:47.680 --> 1:36:52.680]  Okay. So you can suspend, you can put restrictions.
[1:36:52.680 --> 1:37:02.680]  Oh, that's good. I don't want to take too much time with our guests here, but Philip Haney is our guest. That's Trump like four hours ago, speaking in D.C. to the Sheriff's Association, National Association of Sheriffs.
[1:37:02.680 --> 1:37:12.680]  Whether you agree with this law or not, every other country has basically the same law. It's what a country is. It's that power. It's borders. It's language. It's culture. It's a currency. It's laws.
[1:37:12.680 --> 1:37:25.680]  That's a country. It's borders. It's culture. It's language. It's laws. It's currency. Five things. Five things. Like a hand. And if you don't have one of those, baby, you don't have a country.
[1:37:25.680 --> 1:37:34.680]  And that's what globalism is. It's a bunch of multinationals who've already taken over the third world using them as a weapon. It's very, very sad.
[1:37:34.680 --> 1:37:47.680]  But when I come into the country, they ask, you got any fruits? You got any vegetables? And I'm like, I'm glad they're asking that because if I brought in something I didn't know that has some kind of weevil in it or some bug, it's going to devastate the crops.
[1:37:47.680 --> 1:38:00.680]  And they have a right, even though I'm a citizen, to ask me that. And they have rights to ask me other things. But I've come in and literally places in Europe and in Canada and they just let anybody that's clearly from the third world just in.
[1:38:00.680 --> 1:38:08.680]  And if you're from America, third degree or here for business, no, I'm not. Well, blah, blah, blah, we're going to just turn you back over here for three hours in a way.
[1:38:08.680 --> 1:38:20.680]  And again, this is the whole liberalism, which isn't liberalism, the globalism of it. But regardless, you've got failed countries like Sudan and Libya and all these nations imploding with Islamic jihad taking them over.
[1:38:20.680 --> 1:38:28.680]  And then they barely have working airports and they're saying, just bring them into this country. And the last five, six months we have with our guest Philip Haney, you need to get his book.
[1:38:28.680 --> 1:38:35.680]  We don't sell it. I think we did for a while. We should sell it. Then for store.com. I mean, I read it. I read it in two days. And I knew a lot.
[1:38:35.680 --> 1:38:46.680]  I read news all day, but when it came out a year ago or so, I see something say nothing. Philip Haney and Art Moore, a Homeland Security officer exposes the government's submission to jihad.
[1:38:46.680 --> 1:38:54.680]  Man, it's like it took me to a whole other level. And so when I looked at what Trump was saying and the media just, I mean, let me ask you this, Philip.
[1:38:54.680 --> 1:39:00.680]  What is it like to see them acting like he did something outrageous when he didn't even do as much as Obama did?
[1:39:00.680 --> 1:39:09.680]  He bombed four of these countries when he was banning them coming in. I mean, it's just, it's just crazy to see them criticize the president.
[1:39:09.680 --> 1:39:15.680]  But then also out of the other side of the mouth go, well, look, he's using a law Obama used. So see, he's copying Obama.
[1:39:15.680 --> 1:39:22.680]  He says Obama's bad, but he's copying him. But then he's still bad because he's doing it. Are they preying on the public's ignorance of the law?
[1:39:22.680 --> 1:39:24.680]  What do you think the agenda here is?
[1:39:24.680 --> 1:39:32.680]  Well, what we're seeing now is what was going on behind the scenes before. It just hadn't broken out into the visible arena.
[1:39:32.680 --> 1:39:46.680]  Now what you're seeing is the same kind of individuals and policies that were contained within the law enforcement agencies prior to the new administration has now broken out into mainstream media.
[1:39:46.680 --> 1:39:59.680]  So the attempts to shut down enforcement of the law and so on that was going, you're seeing now in open public was going on for years under the Obama administration.
[1:39:59.680 --> 1:40:04.680]  That's basically the theme of the book is that these kind of things are not new.
[1:40:04.680 --> 1:40:22.680]  It actually started with a small group of individuals within law enforcement agencies like Customs and Border Protection, Department of Defense, FBI, and one by one the administration went after what we call subject matter experts and knocked us off one by one.
[1:40:22.680 --> 1:40:28.680]  And once they knocked us out of the picture, then they had an open field to advance these policies.
[1:40:28.680 --> 1:40:45.680]  So what we're really seeing now is a collision between the former policies and the attempt by the new President Trump to start implementing what is already supposed to be law and in place and has been for decades.
[1:40:45.680 --> 1:40:49.680]  So Trump's only re administering the law.
[1:40:49.680 --> 1:41:07.680]  Yes, he referred specifically to 8 USC 1182, which provides very clearly the option for the President to refuse entry or prohibit individuals from certain countries coming in for the sake of national security.
[1:41:07.680 --> 1:41:09.680]  I'll tell you how I see it.
[1:41:09.680 --> 1:41:22.680]  If the people who are protesting this action were really honest about their concerns, they would simply say, okay, President Trump is a temporary order for 120 days.
[1:41:22.680 --> 1:41:27.680]  Let's all get together and study what's going on regarding immigration.
[1:41:27.680 --> 1:41:28.680]  That's right.
[1:41:28.680 --> 1:41:34.680]  Instead of instead of fixing it, so instead of fixing it as he was really trying to do, they just don't want it fixed.
[1:41:34.680 --> 1:41:35.680]  They want to keep it broken.
[1:41:35.680 --> 1:41:45.680]  They won't even admit that there's a problem, which is exactly the reason why people like myself were always in trouble, because they would never listen to what we said.
[1:41:45.680 --> 1:41:48.680]  They would push us, marginalize us.
[1:41:48.680 --> 1:41:50.680]  We have what are called adverse actions.
[1:41:50.680 --> 1:41:51.680]  We get fired.
[1:41:51.680 --> 1:41:56.680]  We get I had my gun taken my secret clearance taken away.
[1:41:56.680 --> 1:42:09.680]  All access to systems removed simply because I pointed out the two major groups that we're involved with, the Muslim Brotherhood and another group called Tablighi Jumat, might pose a threat to our national security.
[1:42:09.680 --> 1:42:10.680]  Now, let's talk about that.
[1:42:10.680 --> 1:42:18.680]  Let's, as much as you can tell us, because I know a lot of it was classified, you're there from other people I've talked to and you talk about in the book, real terrorists are in front of you.
[1:42:18.680 --> 1:42:21.680]  You know who they are, but you can't stop them.
[1:42:21.680 --> 1:42:26.680]  I literally interviewed a whole group of them and I call it in the book, the Madrasa boys.
[1:42:26.680 --> 1:42:28.680]  I saw them face to face.
[1:42:28.680 --> 1:42:37.680]  I watched them grow up from young men into fully mature adults over a four or five year period.
[1:42:37.680 --> 1:42:39.680]  They knew me and I knew them.
[1:42:39.680 --> 1:42:43.680]  I would interview them when they came back from Ramadan every year.
[1:42:43.680 --> 1:42:53.680]  They were attending a Madrasa in South Africa that's spoken or taught in English and I would literally meet them at the gateway of the flight every year when they came back.
[1:42:53.680 --> 1:43:12.680]  And we got to know each other and I learned the entire, the way it works, how these young men from America are going overseas, getting trained to become experts in Sharia law and or Imams and how they gradually grew into this persona of people like Toshvin Malik and Saeed Farooq.
[1:43:12.680 --> 1:43:23.680]  Let's talk about Sam Bernardino, which the FBI admitted for three days they were ordered to not say it's Islamic terror, even though they were screaming Allah Akbar as they attacked the Christmas party and killed their co-workers.
[1:43:23.680 --> 1:43:27.680]  Let's talk about that radicalization, them going back and coming back.
[1:43:27.680 --> 1:43:28.680]  Let's talk about it.
[1:43:28.680 --> 1:43:30.680]  Well, it went on.
[1:43:30.680 --> 1:43:32.680]  It's been going on for quite some time.
[1:43:32.680 --> 1:43:37.680]  There's actually a network of Madrasas right here in the United States, meaning Islamic schools.
[1:43:37.680 --> 1:43:45.680]  They take young men for fifth grade, take them out of public school and send them to the Madrasas and they study the Quran.
[1:43:45.680 --> 1:43:51.680]  That's all until they become what is called a Hafiz, a person who's memorized the Quran.
[1:43:51.680 --> 1:44:04.680]  And then by that skill, they are qualified to attend like the Madrasa I mentioned in South Africa, where they go through a seven year program called an Aleem program where they qualify to become an Imam.
[1:44:04.680 --> 1:44:14.680]  I captured the first generation of American kids, either naturalized or born here, that were going overseas to go through this program.
[1:44:14.680 --> 1:44:25.680]  And that's what led me to go to National Targeting Center in Washington, D.C., where we put together a case that generated 1,200 law enforcement actions in the first nine months of the case.
[1:44:25.680 --> 1:44:31.680]  And by the way, if somebody's a new listener or viewer, we can put the Associated Press, the Hill, Reuters up.
[1:44:31.680 --> 1:44:36.680]  You were so high level, you were a top trainer, they've had to admit you called the truth.
[1:44:36.680 --> 1:44:44.680]  This really happened. I mean, your case for folks that don't remember over a year ago was reported when you broke your silence and exposed all this.
[1:44:44.680 --> 1:44:49.680]  There's the Hill headline, DHS ordered me to scrub records of Muslims with terror ties.
[1:44:49.680 --> 1:44:52.680]  I mean, that is a criminal act, isn't it?
[1:44:52.680 --> 1:44:54.680]  If you followed orders.
[1:44:54.680 --> 1:44:56.680]  It's an abrogation of duty.
[1:44:56.680 --> 1:45:00.680]  It's putting American citizens at risk.
[1:45:00.680 --> 1:45:06.680]  We're not here as law enforcement officers to be popular or be politically correct.
[1:45:06.680 --> 1:45:12.680]  Of course, we recognize the importance of human rights and being courteous to everyone that we need.
[1:45:12.680 --> 1:45:16.680]  Sure, but you're supposed to execute the law, especially against clear and present danger.
[1:45:16.680 --> 1:45:20.680]  That's right, because that's the oath we took, and that's why I'm talking to you now.
[1:45:20.680 --> 1:45:25.680]  I took an oath to protect our country from threat, both foreign and domestic.
[1:45:25.680 --> 1:45:31.680]  And I'm obligated by that oath. If I see something, I must say something, and I did.
[1:45:31.680 --> 1:45:36.680]  And that's why I called the book, See Something, Say Nothing, because that's what they preferred that I would do.
[1:45:36.680 --> 1:45:43.680]  All right, Phillip Haney, in closing, obviously, you know, your testimony has helped really change things in Congress.
[1:45:43.680 --> 1:45:45.680]  The President, obviously, has followed your work.
[1:45:45.680 --> 1:45:48.680]  He's got a lot of patriots involved now, with him.
[1:45:48.680 --> 1:45:50.680]  You surely saw the SENTCOM speech.
[1:45:50.680 --> 1:45:55.680]  Where do you think this is going? Because the enemies of this country do want globalism.
[1:45:55.680 --> 1:45:59.680]  They are allied with the jihad. The left believes that's going to be their army of victory.
[1:45:59.680 --> 1:46:03.680]  I guess they think they can later close the door on them and double-cross them.
[1:46:03.680 --> 1:46:05.680]  I can't believe the left would actually want to be under Sharia law.
[1:46:05.680 --> 1:46:09.680]  But what's your big picture threat assessment? What do you think is really going on here?
[1:46:09.680 --> 1:46:11.680]  Another point you'd like to add?
[1:46:11.680 --> 1:46:16.680]  There are three trigger points or flash points that you can create and imaginary boxes
[1:46:16.680 --> 1:46:20.680]  and put what you're seeing in front of us today in one of the three boxes.
[1:46:20.680 --> 1:46:24.680]  The first one is immigration reform based on these special interest countries.
[1:46:24.680 --> 1:46:30.680]  That's the immigration executive order that we just saw with the seven core special interest countries.
[1:46:30.680 --> 1:46:32.680]  That's the first flash point.
[1:46:32.680 --> 1:46:38.680]  The next one is going to be an attempt to designate the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization
[1:46:38.680 --> 1:46:42.680]  and its affiliated front groups operating in United States,
[1:46:42.680 --> 1:46:47.680]  like Council on American Islamic Relations, ISNA and AIT,
[1:46:47.680 --> 1:46:54.680]  and or re-designating this Poundering Violent Extremism program so it's actually effective.
[1:46:54.680 --> 1:46:56.680]  That will be your second flash point.
[1:46:56.680 --> 1:47:00.680]  The third flash point is going to be our political relationship with Jerusalem.
[1:47:00.680 --> 1:47:01.680]  I mean Israel.
[1:47:01.680 --> 1:47:10.680]  Whether or not we post the ambassador in Jerusalem and or how we support Israel going forward
[1:47:10.680 --> 1:47:12.680]  will be the third major flash point.
[1:47:12.680 --> 1:47:20.680]  And I hate to tell you this, but the immigration reform flash point is the least volatile of the three.
[1:47:20.680 --> 1:47:27.680]  Can you imagine based on what we've already seen backlash both politically judiciary and in the public?
[1:47:27.680 --> 1:47:33.680]  What will happen if the Trump administration designates the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist group
[1:47:33.680 --> 1:47:37.680]  or some of the known front groups operating here in the United States
[1:47:37.680 --> 1:47:41.680]  or reconfigures Poundering Violent Extremism to actually be effective?
[1:47:41.680 --> 1:47:52.680]  And our third one, if we began to have our ambassador or political appointees actually conducting business in Jerusalem,
[1:47:52.680 --> 1:47:55.680]  they won't even have to build an embassy there.
[1:47:55.680 --> 1:47:59.680]  All they're going to have to do is cross that border into Jerusalem
[1:47:59.680 --> 1:48:03.680]  and it's going to see as a violation from the Islamic world.
[1:48:03.680 --> 1:48:07.680]  The Islamic world certainly knows about borders, don't they?
[1:48:07.680 --> 1:48:08.680]  They sure do.
[1:48:08.680 --> 1:48:11.680]  Most other countries don't let Christians or Jews in.
[1:48:11.680 --> 1:48:16.680]  It's just crazy to see the left trying to destroy the most open free societies the world's ever seen.
[1:48:16.680 --> 1:48:18.680]  America's not perfect.
[1:48:18.680 --> 1:48:24.680]  And to quote Merle Haggard, I don't blame somebody switching sides and fighting what they believe in.
[1:48:24.680 --> 1:48:28.680]  But when you try to overthrow the Bill of Rights and Constitution, that's not free speech.
[1:48:28.680 --> 1:48:29.680]  That's sedition.
[1:48:29.680 --> 1:48:32.680]  And that's why I'm chosen what side I'm on.
[1:48:32.680 --> 1:48:35.680]  They're not going after President Trump.
[1:48:35.680 --> 1:48:37.680]  They're going after us.
[1:48:37.680 --> 1:48:38.680]  That's right.
[1:48:38.680 --> 1:48:43.680]  We have the audacity to express our concern for our borders.
[1:48:43.680 --> 1:48:46.680]  A country without borders is not a country.
[1:48:46.680 --> 1:48:47.680]  It doesn't exist.
[1:48:47.680 --> 1:48:48.680]  That's globalism.
[1:48:48.680 --> 1:48:49.680]  This is world government.
[1:48:49.680 --> 1:48:50.680]  Philip, it's been too long.
[1:48:50.680 --> 1:48:52.680]  A year and a half is too long.
[1:48:52.680 --> 1:48:53.680]  Please give us updates every month.
[1:48:53.680 --> 1:48:55.680]  I appreciate you and I appreciate your book.
[1:48:55.680 --> 1:49:00.680]  And I'm going to have my producers get ahold of your folks to carry your book at the M4 store.
[1:49:00.680 --> 1:49:03.680]  Thank you so much, sir, for your service.
[1:49:03.680 --> 1:49:04.680]  You're welcome.
[1:49:04.680 --> 1:49:06.680]  Thank you very much.
[1:49:06.680 --> 1:49:08.680]  You know, I just want to add something here.
[1:49:08.680 --> 1:49:09.680]  I don't have to be politically correct.
[1:49:09.680 --> 1:49:17.680]  I say it because in high school and college, I had quite a few friends that were hardworking, smart, good people that were Muslims.
[1:49:17.680 --> 1:49:19.680]  Because I go off my gut.
[1:49:19.680 --> 1:49:20.680]  They were good people.
[1:49:20.680 --> 1:49:25.680]  But they were all like the sons of doctors and lawyers and scientists.
[1:49:25.680 --> 1:49:33.680]  They were earlier waves that had left the Middle East because they didn't like the oppression and their moms and their daughters didn't wear headdresses.
[1:49:33.680 --> 1:49:35.680]  And they owned companies and had jobs.
[1:49:35.680 --> 1:49:37.680]  Now granted, I'd go with their house.
[1:49:37.680 --> 1:49:38.680]  Damn, it's kind of in charge.
[1:49:38.680 --> 1:49:42.680]  But that's just kind of like old fashioned America.
[1:49:42.680 --> 1:49:54.680]  The people they're bringing in folks are from war torn countries where they're killing each other around the clock because they just constantly are using Islam, the religion as a way to control people.
[1:49:54.680 --> 1:49:55.680]  It's a witch hunt.
[1:49:55.680 --> 1:50:04.680]  Islam has turned into a big giant witch hunt and only the most extreme where they're eating hearts and throwing people off buildings and murdering women.
[1:50:04.680 --> 1:50:09.680]  You know, because they talk back to their husband and then the left's in love with this.
[1:50:09.680 --> 1:50:15.680]  It's fundamentally threatening to a man who has daughters.
[1:50:15.680 --> 1:50:17.680]  It didn't like some patronizing statement.
[1:50:17.680 --> 1:50:19.680]  I love women just to make women think I love women.
[1:50:19.680 --> 1:50:20.680]  I love women.
[1:50:20.680 --> 1:50:23.680]  My problem is spoiled on the living hell out of women.
[1:50:23.680 --> 1:50:38.680]  It's just for somebody that loves women so much, it's fundamentally disgusting to see this whole worship fest of radical Islam and then to know the biggest group hurt by Islam are Muslims and women that are Islamic.
[1:50:38.680 --> 1:50:40.680]  So I don't want a war with Islam.
[1:50:40.680 --> 1:50:46.680]  I have nothing against any of these people, but the worst form of it out of Saudi Arabia is running wild right now and it's got to be dealt with.
[1:50:46.680 --> 1:50:47.680]  There's a lot of breaking news.
[1:50:47.680 --> 1:50:49.680]  We'll cover it all on the other side.
[1:50:49.680 --> 1:50:50.680]  I'm Alex Jones.

[1:51:27.680 --> 1:51:30.680]  My experience with synergy one has been great.
[1:51:30.680 --> 1:51:31.680]  My mood is better.
[1:51:31.680 --> 1:51:33.680]  My joints feel better.
[1:51:33.680 --> 1:51:37.680]  I have more vigor, more stamina, way increased productivity.
[1:51:37.680 --> 1:51:41.680]  My wife and I both noticed that we even dream more.
[1:51:41.680 --> 1:51:43.680]  So I recommend synergy one.
[1:51:43.680 --> 1:51:44.680]  It's really good stuff.

[1:54:01.680 --> 1:54:04.680]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:54:04.680 --> 1:54:10.680]  I fell into a burning ring of fire. I went down, down, down.
[1:54:10.680 --> 1:54:15.680]  And the flames went higher and it burns, burns, burns.
[1:54:15.680 --> 1:54:20.680]  The ring of fire, the ring of fire.
[1:54:20.680 --> 1:54:22.680]  And it burns.
[1:54:22.680 --> 1:54:25.680]  Yeah, the taste of love is sweet when hearts like ours mean.
[1:54:25.680 --> 1:54:29.680]  You have a billion, 300 million Muslims.
[1:54:29.680 --> 1:54:36.680]  Having on average six children, almost all of them surviving being taught,
[1:54:36.680 --> 1:54:40.680]  you will take over, you will kill, you will rule.
[1:54:40.680 --> 1:54:43.680]  And the left going, come on in, sweetie pie.
[1:54:43.680 --> 1:54:49.680]  You know, I have been made knowledgeable about massive censorship taking place.
[1:54:49.680 --> 1:54:52.680]  I'll bring this up with Milo in the next hour.
[1:54:52.680 --> 1:54:58.680]  And Joe didn't say I couldn't talk about this, but when I was on Joe Rogan last week,
[1:54:58.680 --> 1:55:00.680]  he got censored for a day on iTunes.
[1:55:00.680 --> 1:55:05.680]  Now it's the number one podcast, not just of his show, but of all time.
[1:55:05.680 --> 1:55:10.680]  He sent me screenshots of it.
[1:55:10.680 --> 1:55:17.680]  But now on Google Play.
[1:55:17.680 --> 1:55:20.680]  And he sent me screenshots of his internal control panel.
[1:55:20.680 --> 1:55:21.680]  I don't even know.
[1:55:21.680 --> 1:55:23.680]  I texted him and said, can I cover this?
[1:55:23.680 --> 1:55:24.680]  Come on the show like an hour ago.
[1:55:24.680 --> 1:55:26.680]  He didn't respond.
[1:55:26.680 --> 1:55:29.680]  So I'm going to weigh today on this and then cover it.
[1:55:29.680 --> 1:55:31.680]  I called him too.
[1:55:31.680 --> 1:55:33.680]  But this is what we go through, folks.
[1:55:33.680 --> 1:55:39.680]  There's episode 912, 910, not 911 with Alex Jones.
[1:55:39.680 --> 1:55:42.680]  And you know why?
[1:55:42.680 --> 1:55:45.680]  Because it's dynamite.
[1:55:45.680 --> 1:55:50.680]  It's the truth.
[1:55:50.680 --> 1:55:52.680]  It's pizza game.
[1:55:52.680 --> 1:55:54.680]  And not the diversion of the pizza place.
[1:55:54.680 --> 1:55:57.680]  That's how they diverted everybody.
[1:55:57.680 --> 1:56:03.680]  It's what's in the emails and it ties into
[1:56:03.680 --> 1:56:12.680]  Boy's Child and it ties into Sandusky.
[1:56:12.680 --> 1:56:15.680]  And it ties into all the rest of it.
[1:56:15.680 --> 1:56:17.680]  And it goes deep.
[1:56:17.680 --> 1:56:19.680]  And establishment media just doesn't get it.
[1:56:19.680 --> 1:56:20.680]  I love Tucker Carlson.
[1:56:20.680 --> 1:56:21.680]  He's a good guy.
[1:56:21.680 --> 1:56:22.680]  He's been on the show a few times.
[1:56:22.680 --> 1:56:24.680]  He wanted to come down here and meet me and have dinner.
[1:56:24.680 --> 1:56:27.680]  And I've been to dinner with him outside of Austin.
[1:56:27.680 --> 1:56:31.680]  Never has he invited me on his Fox News show with 3, 4 million viewers,
[1:56:31.680 --> 1:56:32.680]  which I think is a good show.
[1:56:32.680 --> 1:56:34.680]  But I don't even care to go on.
[1:56:34.680 --> 1:56:35.680]  I don't care.
[1:56:35.680 --> 1:56:36.680]  I mean, I went on Joe Rogan's show.
[1:56:36.680 --> 1:56:38.680]  That's been seen like 30 million times now.
[1:56:38.680 --> 1:56:39.680]  See what I mean?
[1:56:39.680 --> 1:56:43.680]  It's bigger than this.
[1:56:43.680 --> 1:56:44.680]  My show every day bigger.
[1:56:44.680 --> 1:56:48.680]  But it's just like, look, unlikely allies.
[1:56:48.680 --> 1:56:54.680]  Tucker and Piers Morgan team up to smash neoliberals and mainstream media.
[1:56:54.680 --> 1:56:57.680]  It's like they're in a whole other lower level than me.
[1:56:57.680 --> 1:57:01.680]  And then they think they're in a higher level.
[1:57:01.680 --> 1:57:02.680]  He doesn't.
[1:57:02.680 --> 1:57:06.680]  I mean, he wasn't stupid wanting to have the ascension of a top libertarian talk show
[1:57:06.680 --> 1:57:10.680]  host, get rid of the bow tie, come kiss the M4's ring.
[1:57:10.680 --> 1:57:12.680]  Tucker Carlson's off and running.
[1:57:12.680 --> 1:57:14.680]  And I don't want anybody kissing my ring.
[1:57:14.680 --> 1:57:20.680]  It's just that I know what's really going on in the real world versus all this BS.
[1:57:20.680 --> 1:57:25.680]  And Piers Morgan is an anti-gun, globalist slime ball engaged in all sorts of dirty stuff
[1:57:25.680 --> 1:57:32.680]  who now knows he was defeated and is crawling back acting like he's one of us.
[1:57:32.680 --> 1:57:37.680]  With a bunch of snide backhanded support of Trump, just like Howard Stern.
[1:57:37.680 --> 1:57:39.680]  Oh, Trump didn't want to win.
[1:57:39.680 --> 1:57:42.680]  Trump doesn't mean any of this with all the evidence shows the opposite.
[1:57:42.680 --> 1:57:43.680]  I'm just sick of it.
[1:57:43.680 --> 1:57:45.680]  Let me just end this hour with this.
[1:57:45.680 --> 1:57:46.680]  You want to support us?
[1:57:46.680 --> 1:57:50.680]  We'll go to the next level and be 10 times better than these people and restore the Republic
[1:57:50.680 --> 1:57:56.680]  Super Blue fluoride free made America organic toothpaste with the iodine, nascent iodine

[1:58:02.680 --> 1:58:03.680]  $9.95.

[1:58:32.680 --> 1:58:34.680]  Milo's coming up.
[1:58:34.680 --> 1:58:40.680]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[1:58:40.680 --> 1:58:45.680]  Visit GCN live dot com today.
[1:58:45.680 --> 1:58:50.680]  The Democrat excuse me double standard party is melting down like Fukushima today.
[1:58:50.680 --> 1:58:54.680]  The Republicans gave them a little rope the floor and a microphone and they have been
[1:58:54.680 --> 1:58:59.680]  hanging themselves with it all day in protest of Jeff sessions double standard cited Trump's
[1:58:59.680 --> 1:59:04.680]  Muslim ban a number of times not as many times as Muslims have been permitted to travel to
[1:59:04.680 --> 1:59:08.680]  and from this country since said ban but that's because it's not a Muslim ban.
[1:59:08.680 --> 1:59:14.680]  The double standards then pleaded to end voter ID loss citing racism a typical move from
[1:59:14.680 --> 1:59:15.680]  double standards.
[1:59:15.680 --> 1:59:18.680]  They think if they play the race card they can never be wrong wrong.
[1:59:18.680 --> 1:59:22.680]  That is absolute wrong proved over and over again.
[1:59:22.680 --> 1:59:23.680]  But wait a second.
[1:59:23.680 --> 1:59:27.680]  Remember the double standards crying about how Russia influenced the election.
[1:59:27.680 --> 1:59:31.680]  Well without voter ID laws what's to stop that from happening again.
[1:59:31.680 --> 1:59:35.680]  I'm shocked they didn't cry racist against Native Americans when Elizabeth Warren got
[1:59:35.680 --> 1:59:36.680]  banned.
[1:59:36.680 --> 1:59:37.680]  Oh wait that was fake news.
[1:59:37.680 --> 1:59:39.680]  The Democratic Party is dead.
[1:59:39.680 --> 1:59:42.680]  The double standard party is alive and well.
[1:59:42.680 --> 1:59:47.680]  This is Owen Troyer for info wars dot com.
[1:59:47.680 --> 1:59:56.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:59:56.680 --> 2:00:01.680]  I've got a tiger by the tail to explain the sea.
[2:00:01.680 --> 2:00:02.680]  Oh yeah.
[2:00:02.680 --> 2:00:07.680]  I won't be much when you get through with me.
[2:00:07.680 --> 2:00:10.680]  He never gives up.
[2:00:10.680 --> 2:00:24.680]  He's Alex Jones broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas worldwide.
[2:00:24.680 --> 2:00:29.680]  Confidence does not take you all the way when it comes up against strength or skill.
[2:00:29.680 --> 2:00:32.680]  The globalists have got a lot of hoodspot.
[2:00:32.680 --> 2:00:34.680]  A lot of bravada.
[2:00:34.680 --> 2:00:39.680]  But it's kind of like having a big old hat no cattle.
[2:00:39.680 --> 2:00:42.680]  They got a tiger by the tail.
[2:00:42.680 --> 2:00:45.680]  Oh it's plain to see isn't it globalist.
[2:00:45.680 --> 2:00:48.680]  I won't be much when you get through with me.
[2:00:48.680 --> 2:00:50.680]  No you won't will you.
[2:00:50.680 --> 2:00:55.680]  While I'm losing weight and I'm turning mighty pale.
[2:00:55.680 --> 2:00:58.680]  Looks like I've got a tiger by the tail.
[2:00:58.680 --> 2:00:59.680]  You do.
[2:00:59.680 --> 2:01:01.680]  Pelosi can hardly talk.
[2:01:01.680 --> 2:01:04.680]  Maxine Waters can hardly talk.
[2:01:04.680 --> 2:01:06.680]  Chuck E. Schumer can hardly talk.
[2:01:06.680 --> 2:01:10.680]  Look real scared don't they because they know they've been representing.
[2:01:10.680 --> 2:01:16.680]  They were presiding over in a sleep population and they thought they were in the land of milk and honey.
[2:01:16.680 --> 2:01:20.680]  They thought it would never end.
[2:01:20.680 --> 2:01:24.680]  All over the world their programs are in deep crisis.
[2:01:24.680 --> 2:01:30.680]  Milo's got the number one book on Amazon and going up the New York Times charts a month before it comes out.
[2:01:30.680 --> 2:01:36.680]  Promise he'll give us a big Skype interview.
[2:01:36.680 --> 2:01:39.680]  He wants me to go out to Miami next week and do some big celebration broadcast.
[2:01:39.680 --> 2:01:42.680]  I'm tempted to do it because the Joe Rogan thing went so well.
[2:01:42.680 --> 2:01:48.680]  We immediately saw like 15 million new listeners come into the streams and the views.
[2:01:48.680 --> 2:01:50.680]  I was like man that's great.
[2:01:50.680 --> 2:01:51.680]  I go on Fox News.
[2:01:51.680 --> 2:01:53.680]  We don't get like 10,000 new people.
[2:01:53.680 --> 2:01:54.680]  I'm going on Fox News.
[2:01:54.680 --> 2:01:56.680]  I'm going to see a blip on our traffic.
[2:01:56.680 --> 2:02:00.680]  Because they got an audience put us a bunch of zombies on average.
[2:02:00.680 --> 2:02:02.680]  I'm not saying you're a zombie if you watch but you know what I mean.
[2:02:02.680 --> 2:02:04.680]  The average person is not really doing much.
[2:02:04.680 --> 2:02:05.680]  It watches that.
[2:02:05.680 --> 2:02:07.680]  I go on some little Christian station.
[2:02:07.680 --> 2:02:08.680]  We just blows our doors off.
[2:02:08.680 --> 2:02:09.680]  Going for an hour.
[2:02:09.680 --> 2:02:10.680]  Going coast to coast.
[2:02:10.680 --> 2:02:11.680]  Stay in.
[2:02:11.680 --> 2:02:12.680]  Get a big response.
[2:02:12.680 --> 2:02:13.680]  Going Howard Stern get a big response.
[2:02:13.680 --> 2:02:15.680]  But mainstream media not so much.
[2:02:15.680 --> 2:02:17.680]  Speaking of mainstream media.
[2:02:17.680 --> 2:02:21.680]  Let's go to some of the clips of the Barack Obama's tough talk on immigration tied into old 45.
[2:02:21.680 --> 2:02:22.680]  Here it is.
[2:02:22.680 --> 2:02:23.680]  All Americans.
[2:02:23.680 --> 2:02:27.680]  Not only in the states most heavily affected but in every place in this country are rightly
[2:02:27.680 --> 2:02:33.680]  disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our country.
[2:02:33.680 --> 2:02:37.680]  The jobs they hold might otherwise be held by citizens or legal immigrants.
[2:02:37.680 --> 2:02:41.680]  The public service they use imposed burdens on our taxpayers.
[2:02:41.680 --> 2:02:46.680]  That's why our administration has moved aggressively to secure our borders more by
[2:02:46.680 --> 2:02:50.680]  hiring a record number of new border guards by deporting twice as many criminal aliens
[2:02:50.680 --> 2:02:56.680]  as ever before by cracking down on illegal hiring by barring welfare benefits to illegal
[2:02:56.680 --> 2:02:57.680]  aliens.
[2:02:57.680 --> 2:03:02.680]  In the budget I will present to you we will try to do more to speed the deportation of
[2:03:02.680 --> 2:03:06.680]  illegal aliens who are arrested for crimes to better identify illegal aliens in the
[2:03:06.680 --> 2:03:12.680]  work face as recommended by the commission headed by former congresswoman Barbara Jordan.
[2:03:12.680 --> 2:03:17.680]  We are a nation of immigrants but we are also a nation of laws.
[2:03:17.680 --> 2:03:22.680]  Undocumented workers broke our immigration laws and I believe that they must be held
[2:03:22.680 --> 2:03:25.680]  accountable especially those who may be dangerous.
[2:03:25.680 --> 2:03:31.680]  When I took office I committed to fixing this broken immigration system and I began by doing
[2:03:31.680 --> 2:03:37.680]  what I could to secure our borders but today our immigration system is broken and everybody
[2:03:37.680 --> 2:03:38.680]  knows it.
[2:03:38.680 --> 2:03:42.680]  There are actions I have the legal authority to take as president.
[2:03:42.680 --> 2:03:48.680]  Tonight I'm announcing those actions.
[2:03:48.680 --> 2:03:53.680]  We'll build on our progress at the border with additional resources for our law enforcement
[2:03:53.680 --> 2:03:58.680]  personnel so that they can stem the flow of illegal crossings and speed the return of
[2:03:58.680 --> 2:04:01.680]  those who do cross over.
[2:04:01.680 --> 2:04:04.680]  If you're a criminal you'll be deported.
[2:04:04.680 --> 2:04:09.680]  If you plan to enter the U.S. illegally your chances of getting caught and sent back just
[2:04:09.680 --> 2:04:10.680]  went up.
[2:04:10.680 --> 2:04:14.680]  We expect people who live in this country to play by the rules.
[2:04:14.680 --> 2:04:18.680]  We expect that those who cut the line will not be unfairly rewarded.
[2:04:18.680 --> 2:04:23.680]  The actions I'm taking are not only lawful, they're the kinds of actions taken by every
[2:04:23.680 --> 2:04:29.680]  single Republican president and every single Democratic president for the past half century.
[2:04:29.680 --> 2:04:33.680]  And to those members of congress who question my authority to make our immigration system
[2:04:33.680 --> 2:04:37.680]  work better, question my authority to question my authority to question my authority to
[2:04:37.680 --> 2:04:43.680]  question my authority to question my authority or question the wisdom of me acting where
[2:04:43.680 --> 2:04:46.680]  congress has failed, I have one answer.
[2:04:46.680 --> 2:04:56.680]  Pass a bill.
[2:04:56.680 --> 2:04:59.680]  Radiation in Fukushima has reached unprecedented levels.
[2:04:59.680 --> 2:05:03.680]  News has been breaking for days now that radiation levels inside the damaged nuclear reactor
[2:05:03.680 --> 2:05:06.680]  are at their highest point since the meltdown in 2011.
[2:05:06.680 --> 2:05:11.680]  Tokyo Electric Power, or TEPCO, has said that readings as high as 530 seabirds an hour have
[2:05:11.680 --> 2:05:15.680]  been recorded inside of nuclear reactor number two, one of the three failing reactors, that's
[2:05:15.680 --> 2:05:17.680]  100 times the fatal level.
[2:05:17.680 --> 2:05:21.680]  This increase is quite alarming considering the previous high was 73 seabirds an hour,
[2:05:21.680 --> 2:05:23.680]  a 700% increase.
[2:05:23.680 --> 2:05:27.680]  The hypothesis for the increased levels at this point is that nuclear fuel melted a hole
[2:05:27.680 --> 2:05:28.680]  through a containment vessel.
[2:05:28.680 --> 2:05:32.680]  These increased levels of radiation will make cleanup even more difficult considering the
[2:05:32.680 --> 2:05:36.680]  most advanced robot for the assignment can only last two hours in the atmosphere before
[2:05:36.680 --> 2:05:37.680]  failing.
[2:05:37.680 --> 2:05:41.680]  Estimated cost of cleanup, if possible, is said to have doubled, but let's be honest,
[2:05:41.680 --> 2:05:43.680]  the cost of this is immeasurable.
[2:05:43.680 --> 2:05:47.680]  This meltdown has already severely crippled marine life in the Pacific Ocean.
[2:05:47.680 --> 2:05:50.680]  The protesters in the mainstream news are still silent on this issue.
[2:05:50.680 --> 2:06:19.680]  I'm Owen Shroyer for infowars.com.

[2:06:54.680 --> 2:06:59.680]  If you ever wonder what happened to America, they lost.
[2:06:59.680 --> 2:07:00.680]  We won.
[2:07:00.680 --> 2:07:02.680]  Wanna see what Trump's up against?
[2:07:02.680 --> 2:07:05.680]  Revelation, the movie.info.
[2:07:05.680 --> 2:07:10.680]  Because of what we did on this day, change has come to America.
[2:07:10.680 --> 2:07:16.680]  The nation has been hijacked by international forces, bent on global governance.
[2:07:16.680 --> 2:07:22.680]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie.
[2:07:22.680 --> 2:07:28.680]  God was in school, morality had a future, and beef was for supper.
[2:07:28.680 --> 2:07:31.680]  Revelation, dawn of global government.
[2:07:31.680 --> 2:07:32.680]  We're the solution.
[2:07:32.680 --> 2:07:35.680]  Americans, ain't nothing more to it than that.
[2:07:35.680 --> 2:07:40.680]  Star in Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, and Special Ops General, Jerry Boykin.
[2:07:40.680 --> 2:07:44.680]  The Actual Screenings on Demand, DVDs now available.
[2:07:44.680 --> 2:07:47.680]  Wanna shed some tears over the red, white and blue?
[2:07:47.680 --> 2:07:50.680]  Americans need to see this film.
[2:07:50.680 --> 2:07:53.680]  Revelation, the movie.info.
[2:07:53.680 --> 2:07:55.680]  Let's fix it.
[2:07:55.680 --> 2:07:57.680]  What are we going to do?
[2:07:57.680 --> 2:08:03.680]  How can a president who is acting in the manner that he's acting,
[2:08:03.680 --> 2:08:08.680]  whether he's talking about the travel ban, the way that he's targeting Muslims,
[2:08:08.680 --> 2:08:13.680]  or whether he's talking about his relationship to Putin and the Kremlin,
[2:08:13.680 --> 2:08:20.680]  and knowing that they have hacked our DCCC and DNC,
[2:08:20.680 --> 2:08:31.680]  and knowing that he is responsible for supplying the bombs that killed innocent children and families.
[2:08:31.680 --> 2:08:33.680]  What is Aleppo?
[2:08:33.680 --> 2:08:34.680]  Yeah, in Aleppo.
[2:08:37.680 --> 2:08:39.680]  You are correct.
[2:08:43.680 --> 2:08:47.680]  The fact that he is wrapping his arms around Putin,
[2:08:47.680 --> 2:08:54.680]  while Putin is continuing to advance into Korea.
[2:08:54.680 --> 2:09:06.680]  Well, Milo, a very busy man, probably the biggest news story other than President Trump the last week,
[2:09:06.680 --> 2:09:09.680]  since leftist viciously attacked him and others.
[2:09:09.680 --> 2:09:12.680]  You see Berkeley beating up women, you name it.
[2:09:12.680 --> 2:09:17.680]  And since Robert Reich and others who work at the school came out and said it was a good thing, basically,
[2:09:17.680 --> 2:09:21.680]  Milo's book is going to number one across the charts.
[2:09:21.680 --> 2:09:24.680]  And they've now got a video game out. It's up on infowars.com.
[2:09:24.680 --> 2:09:29.680]  It's on Drudge. It's on Breitbart.com, where they're saying, kill him.
[2:09:29.680 --> 2:09:31.680]  Beat him to death.
[2:09:31.680 --> 2:09:33.680]  And we also got the secret plans.
[2:09:33.680 --> 2:09:35.680]  Dr. Corsi got them. The story really needs to go viral.
[2:09:35.680 --> 2:09:41.680]  Leak Docs, Brock conspires with Facebook, Google to shut down conservative news.
[2:09:41.680 --> 2:09:43.680]  I don't really call myself conservative.
[2:09:43.680 --> 2:09:46.680]  I'm just commonsense Americana libertarian.
[2:09:46.680 --> 2:09:49.680]  But yeah, they want to shut down libertarians, conservatives, you name it.
[2:09:49.680 --> 2:09:52.680]  It's gay like Milo doesn't, you know, agree with whatever the latest brainwashing is,
[2:09:52.680 --> 2:09:55.680]  or if he agrees with free speech, he's got to be shut down.
[2:09:55.680 --> 2:09:58.680]  We have Derspiegel here, whether this is well today, there in the peanut gallery.
[2:09:58.680 --> 2:10:01.680]  And of course, they claim Trump's trying to chop the heads off of liberty
[2:10:01.680 --> 2:10:03.680]  by doing something four presidents have done.
[2:10:03.680 --> 2:10:04.680]  And it's the law.
[2:10:04.680 --> 2:10:07.680]  Meanwhile, they don't show you in Derspiegel the jihadist cutting heads off
[2:10:07.680 --> 2:10:11.680]  because Merkel is in a deal with Peter Sutherland of the U.N.
[2:10:11.680 --> 2:10:15.680]  to get rid of the homogeneity of Europe.
[2:10:15.680 --> 2:10:19.680]  So look, I'm not just saying everything should be white, but God,
[2:10:19.680 --> 2:10:21.680]  I hear I need to be dealt with and gotten rid of.
[2:10:21.680 --> 2:10:22.680]  It's crazy.
[2:10:22.680 --> 2:10:24.680]  So Milo joins us at the balance of the hour.
[2:10:24.680 --> 2:10:28.680]  In fact, we're looking at me, maybe me going out to Florida next week
[2:10:28.680 --> 2:10:31.680]  for a special celebration transmission here live on air.
[2:10:31.680 --> 2:10:33.680]  We'll know about that by tomorrow.
[2:10:33.680 --> 2:10:35.680]  But Milo, where, where to begin?
[2:10:35.680 --> 2:10:38.680]  I mean, it just seems like things are getting crazier and crazier.
[2:10:38.680 --> 2:10:43.680]  I'm a little jealous that there's not a big video game where I get beaten and killed, though.
[2:10:43.680 --> 2:10:45.680]  So I'm not doing my job here.
[2:10:45.680 --> 2:10:47.680]  I'm going to get a little jealous.
[2:10:47.680 --> 2:10:50.680]  No, I thought if there was going to be a video game of one or the other of us,
[2:10:50.680 --> 2:10:51.680]  it would be you first.
[2:10:51.680 --> 2:10:56.680]  I thought you would be the one to get the let's punch Alex Jones video game.
[2:10:56.680 --> 2:10:57.680]  I'm sorry that didn't happen.
[2:10:57.680 --> 2:10:59.680]  Maybe I'll make you one.
[2:10:59.680 --> 2:11:01.680]  Well, where does it start since we just talked on Monday?
[2:11:01.680 --> 2:11:06.680]  I mean, it just seems like they're going crazier and crazier and crazier.
[2:11:06.680 --> 2:11:08.680]  What's the latest?
[2:11:08.680 --> 2:11:12.680]  Well, it's now just sort of outright open season on anyone with politics
[2:11:12.680 --> 2:11:14.680]  to the right of Jane Fonda.
[2:11:14.680 --> 2:11:16.680]  You know, you can call them Nazis.
[2:11:16.680 --> 2:11:19.680]  You can call us white supremacists, anti-Semites,
[2:11:19.680 --> 2:11:22.680]  pretty much anything you can think of, you know, from, from anyone,
[2:11:22.680 --> 2:11:25.680]  from, from your sort of libertarian Americana,
[2:11:25.680 --> 2:11:30.680]  sort of politics, as I think is a good summary of you and many of your listeners.
[2:11:30.680 --> 2:11:32.680]  You know, I'm a sort of, I don't know.
[2:11:32.680 --> 2:11:34.680]  I don't even know what I am to Breitbart.
[2:11:34.680 --> 2:11:36.680]  You know, that's good to find yourself.
[2:11:36.680 --> 2:11:38.680]  I mean, cause it's hard to define a complex person.
[2:11:38.680 --> 2:11:41.680]  I mean, but how would you define yourself?
[2:11:41.680 --> 2:11:44.680]  Well, I suppose I'm, I'm a cultural libertarian.
[2:11:44.680 --> 2:11:47.680]  I think people should be able to say, do and be anything.
[2:11:47.680 --> 2:11:51.680]  Economically, I'm probably conservative, foreign policy,
[2:11:51.680 --> 2:11:54.680]  probably, I don't know, sort of nationalist protectionist.
[2:11:54.680 --> 2:11:57.680]  That's, that's where I kind of come up and touch Trump supporters, I guess.
[2:11:57.680 --> 2:11:58.680]  Sure.
[2:11:58.680 --> 2:12:00.680]  Strong borders, not a huge fan of-
[2:12:00.680 --> 2:12:01.680]  But you're a free speech guy now.
[2:12:01.680 --> 2:12:02.680]  I mean, you're Mr. Free Speech.
[2:12:02.680 --> 2:12:04.680]  That is, that is what I'm most known for.
[2:12:04.680 --> 2:12:07.680]  And that, and that's the liberal, cultural libertarian sort of bit of it.
[2:12:07.680 --> 2:12:10.680]  I want people to just be able to read anything, play anything, do anything.
[2:12:10.680 --> 2:12:12.680]  Why do they, that's a great definition to yourself.
[2:12:12.680 --> 2:12:15.680]  Why do they, I mean, obviously you're a good-looking guy, you're sharp,
[2:12:15.680 --> 2:12:16.680]  you're real spoken.
[2:12:16.680 --> 2:12:17.680]  They're everything they wish they were.
[2:12:17.680 --> 2:12:18.680]  Let's just be honest.
[2:12:18.680 --> 2:12:20.680]  Is that why they're so pissed at you?
[2:12:20.680 --> 2:12:22.680]  Well, you know, Ann Coulter said this on Twitter.
[2:12:22.680 --> 2:12:25.680]  She got so much, so much criticism from her.
[2:12:25.680 --> 2:12:26.680]  She's absolutely right.
[2:12:26.680 --> 2:12:28.680]  Where would protest be without fat girls?
[2:12:28.680 --> 2:12:31.680]  And you know, it's not nice to say, but you look out there at the Women's March,
[2:12:31.680 --> 2:12:36.680]  you look at all this kind of stuff and you've got very miserable, older,
[2:12:36.680 --> 2:12:39.680]  single, lonely millennials looking for someone to blame.
[2:12:39.680 --> 2:12:41.680]  They're looking for a reason they're like...
[2:12:41.680 --> 2:12:42.680]  By the way, you've been saying that for years.
[2:12:42.680 --> 2:12:45.680]  When I was in the Women's March in D.C., I'm not being me,
[2:12:45.680 --> 2:12:46.680]  because I'm not, you know, I'm 40-something years old,
[2:12:46.680 --> 2:12:47.680]  I'm not as good-looking as they used to be.
[2:12:47.680 --> 2:12:49.680]  I'm not putting down women that are overweight,
[2:12:49.680 --> 2:12:53.680]  but it was like crazy, aggressive, ugly, giant fat women screaming and yelling,
[2:12:53.680 --> 2:12:55.680]  and yelling the name of their vagina,
[2:12:55.680 --> 2:12:58.680]  and then telling me I'm an effing white male, go to hell.
[2:12:58.680 --> 2:13:00.680]  It was like, this is some kind of joke.
[2:13:00.680 --> 2:13:04.680]  I know, and of course, Rush said this many years ago, you know,
[2:13:04.680 --> 2:13:07.680]  feminism is how unattractive women get into the mainstream, you know,
[2:13:07.680 --> 2:13:10.680]  get attention, and I guess sometimes it seems to me
[2:13:10.680 --> 2:13:12.680]  the opposition to Trump falls into that category.
[2:13:12.680 --> 2:13:18.680]  What we've done in culture is provide women with a battery of conflicting lies
[2:13:18.680 --> 2:13:22.680]  that they are expected at some point over their life to try to reconcile.
[2:13:22.680 --> 2:13:24.680]  We've told them they can have everything,
[2:13:24.680 --> 2:13:27.680]  but also in the workplace, they're victims, which is not true.
[2:13:27.680 --> 2:13:31.680]  You know, campus rape culture and the wage gap, all of that is garbage.
[2:13:31.680 --> 2:13:35.680]  We've told them that, you know, a variety of things
[2:13:35.680 --> 2:13:38.680]  that simply don't conform to reality with the result that we've created
[2:13:38.680 --> 2:13:40.680]  a generation of really unhappy women,
[2:13:40.680 --> 2:13:42.680]  and those women are looking for somebody to blame,
[2:13:42.680 --> 2:13:46.680]  they're looking to lash out, and Trump has, I think, been a locus for,
[2:13:46.680 --> 2:13:50.680]  and so am I, actually, and part of the reason I am is that, you know,
[2:13:50.680 --> 2:13:52.680]  I'm gay, so I don't have to be nice to women,
[2:13:52.680 --> 2:13:54.680]  because I don't want to have sex.
[2:13:54.680 --> 2:13:57.680]  So, you know, I don't have to pretend to be nice to girls,
[2:13:57.680 --> 2:14:01.680]  so I'll talk about, you know, the vast gap, you know,
[2:14:01.680 --> 2:14:04.680]  between feminism and reality, between, you know, campus conspiracy theories
[2:14:04.680 --> 2:14:07.680]  and how people are actually suffering in America,
[2:14:07.680 --> 2:14:09.680]  in very, very many cases, it's the men suffering, not the women,
[2:14:09.680 --> 2:14:12.680]  and because I don't have skin in the game, you know, I can be honest about it,
[2:14:12.680 --> 2:14:14.680]  so they hate me just as much.
[2:14:14.680 --> 2:14:16.680]  But the key thing for me, really, and what this book is about
[2:14:16.680 --> 2:14:20.680]  and what Berkeley was about is the fact that the left today
[2:14:20.680 --> 2:14:25.680]  has become so fundamentally terrified of differing opinions,
[2:14:25.680 --> 2:14:29.680]  absolutely petrified of free speech, because for 30 years,
[2:14:29.680 --> 2:14:32.680]  they have run academia, they've run the entertainment industry,
[2:14:32.680 --> 2:14:35.680]  they've run the news business, they've run all of these big institutions
[2:14:35.680 --> 2:14:37.680]  of civil, social...
[2:14:37.680 --> 2:14:39.680]  And they've run it all into the ground.
[2:14:39.680 --> 2:14:41.680]  And they've run it badly, they've run it really badly,
[2:14:41.680 --> 2:14:43.680]  and they've got so complacent over those 30 years
[2:14:43.680 --> 2:14:46.680]  that they've started to make two really big strategic errors, as I see it.
[2:14:46.680 --> 2:14:49.680]  One is they just insult everyone they don't like
[2:14:49.680 --> 2:14:51.680]  instead of reasoning with them instead of arguing with them,
[2:14:51.680 --> 2:14:53.680]  and that's the sort of shut up straight white male instinct, you know?
[2:14:53.680 --> 2:14:56.680]  Yeah, they'll never debate, they're in public in front of cameras,
[2:14:56.680 --> 2:14:58.680]  but won't talk to us.
[2:14:58.680 --> 2:15:01.680]  No, because they don't know the facts, because they got so used to just
[2:15:01.680 --> 2:15:04.680]  having their opinion waved through, they've forgotten how to defend it.
[2:15:04.680 --> 2:15:07.680]  And they've also not realized that times have moved on.
[2:15:07.680 --> 2:15:09.680]  And 30 years ago, many of the things that feminists were saying
[2:15:09.680 --> 2:15:12.680]  might have been true, but they're not anymore.
[2:15:12.680 --> 2:15:15.680]  You know, more women now go to college, more women graduate, they get better grades.
[2:15:15.680 --> 2:15:17.680]  That wasn't the case 30 years ago.
[2:15:17.680 --> 2:15:19.680]  Sure, shift, and I'm going to go back into this, but shifting gears
[2:15:19.680 --> 2:15:22.680]  with the tragic nightclub shooting that killed one of 50-something people,
[2:15:22.680 --> 2:15:24.680]  they tried to cover up Islamic terror there, and you know,
[2:15:24.680 --> 2:15:27.680]  Trump pointing out Islamic terror now, and the fact that they've whitewashed it,
[2:15:27.680 --> 2:15:30.680]  but everybody I've talked to across the country was a major turning point
[2:15:30.680 --> 2:15:33.680]  in the gay community, going out, getting firearms, you know,
[2:15:33.680 --> 2:15:36.680]  you talking about that, saying, hey, I shoot back.
[2:15:36.680 --> 2:15:39.680]  I mean, growing up at parties, college, whatever, it wasn't,
[2:15:39.680 --> 2:15:42.680]  whether somebody was black or white or gay or straight, it was whether,
[2:15:42.680 --> 2:15:44.680]  were they fun to hang out with, did they tell good jokes.
[2:15:44.680 --> 2:15:47.680]  So I grew up not being guilty about hating anybody,
[2:15:47.680 --> 2:15:51.680]  and now that attacked and told on this hate monger, it's really kind of pissed me off,
[2:15:51.680 --> 2:15:55.680]  but it seems like that nightclub massacre was a key turning point.
[2:15:55.680 --> 2:15:56.680]  Am I right to say that?
[2:15:56.680 --> 2:15:58.680]  I think it was a wake-up call.
[2:15:58.680 --> 2:16:01.680]  I think it was the moment people realized that identity politics had gone nuts,
[2:16:01.680 --> 2:16:05.680]  because, you know, you had a Muslim guy shooting, as a result of his ideology,
[2:16:05.680 --> 2:16:08.680]  as he told us, he was very clear about that, you know,
[2:16:08.680 --> 2:16:13.680]  shooting, killing 49 gays and hurting another 50,
[2:16:13.680 --> 2:16:15.680]  and the response to the progressive left was,
[2:16:15.680 --> 2:16:18.680]  oh, we must be careful about Islamophobia in the light of, you know,
[2:16:18.680 --> 2:16:20.680]  in the wake of Orlando.
[2:16:20.680 --> 2:16:22.680]  And wasn't it that he was also, like, really latent,
[2:16:22.680 --> 2:16:24.680]  and he was upset about what he was doing?
[2:16:24.680 --> 2:16:26.680]  Because he had the gay app and was, you know, cruising, right?
[2:16:26.680 --> 2:16:28.680]  Yeah, I did read reports about that.
[2:16:28.680 --> 2:16:30.680]  I don't know if it was true.
[2:16:30.680 --> 2:16:33.680]  I don't know if, because two of the witnesses who said they'd had sex with him
[2:16:33.680 --> 2:16:35.680]  turned out to be in various different ways.
[2:16:35.680 --> 2:16:39.680]  Sure, but regardless, they tried to make it all about the poor Muslims.
[2:16:39.680 --> 2:16:40.680]  Yes, of course they did.
[2:16:40.680 --> 2:16:43.680]  And this was the first time that we realized that logic, reason, and fact
[2:16:43.680 --> 2:16:46.680]  had gone out of the window, and that you couldn't trust any more journalists,
[2:16:46.680 --> 2:16:50.680]  celebrities, politicians, or really anybody in public life,
[2:16:50.680 --> 2:16:53.680]  anybody into polite society to tell the truth when bad things happen
[2:16:53.680 --> 2:16:55.680]  between conflicting groups who don't like each other very much.
[2:16:55.680 --> 2:16:58.680]  It is only a surprise to journalists.
[2:16:58.680 --> 2:16:59.680]  Sure, let me ask you this question.
[2:16:59.680 --> 2:17:03.680]  France has been over to the Islamic invasion, the very nastiest of the nasty.
[2:17:03.680 --> 2:17:06.680]  So they attack there, they murder there, they hate it, they have contempt.
[2:17:06.680 --> 2:17:10.680]  The liberals and the gays have just rolled out a red carpet on average to Islam,
[2:17:10.680 --> 2:17:13.680]  but all over the world they attack gay nightclubs.
[2:17:13.680 --> 2:17:16.680]  I mean, where's the two plus two equals four here?
[2:17:16.680 --> 2:17:19.680]  It's completely insane, and this is what happens when you start to focus,
[2:17:19.680 --> 2:17:21.680]  and you were saying a moment ago, you know, when you were at college,
[2:17:21.680 --> 2:17:22.680]  and this is the same for me.
[2:17:22.680 --> 2:17:24.680]  I mean, you know, we're not too far away in age,
[2:17:24.680 --> 2:17:27.680]  and when we were growing up, you know, we were living in the legacy of Martin Luther King,
[2:17:27.680 --> 2:17:31.680]  you know, it was about the content of your character, not the color of your skin.
[2:17:31.680 --> 2:17:34.680]  Well, we've thrown out logic, reason, and facts.
[2:17:34.680 --> 2:17:36.680]  We've thrown out character, thrown out learning,
[2:17:36.680 --> 2:17:39.680]  we've thrown out, you know, looking into somebody's heart,
[2:17:39.680 --> 2:17:42.680]  and instead inherited this system of politics that judges people,
[2:17:42.680 --> 2:17:46.680]  categorizes them, and gives them various special treatment and privileges
[2:17:46.680 --> 2:17:49.680]  according to their skin color, their sexuality, and their gender.
[2:17:49.680 --> 2:17:54.680]  That is the world view that the majority of American media buy into,
[2:17:54.680 --> 2:17:58.680]  that almost the entire American higher education establishment buys into,
[2:17:58.680 --> 2:18:02.680]  and that a sizeable proportion even of politicians buy into,
[2:18:02.680 --> 2:18:05.680]  and it is poisonous, it is counterfactual, and it is ludicrous,
[2:18:05.680 --> 2:18:09.680]  and it gives rise to these absurdities like having to defend Islamic terrorists
[2:18:09.680 --> 2:18:14.680]  or at least panda to Islam in the wake of 50 gay people being shot in Florida of all places.
[2:18:14.680 --> 2:18:18.680]  It is so, so awful, and because it's so completely unsustainable,
[2:18:18.680 --> 2:18:23.680]  it requires a strategy of clamping down on free speech in order to survive,
[2:18:23.680 --> 2:18:27.680]  because you cannot make social justice arguments in good conscience with possession of order.
[2:18:27.680 --> 2:18:29.680]  That's exactly what it's common sense.
[2:18:29.680 --> 2:18:32.680]  So, Ma, let me ask you this, and I don't say this to be chilling.
[2:18:32.680 --> 2:18:34.680]  I mean, this is what my gut tells me,
[2:18:34.680 --> 2:18:37.680]  and so I don't say this to be like some type of bad omen or whatever,
[2:18:37.680 --> 2:18:40.680]  but I personally have family, I personally get threats,
[2:18:40.680 --> 2:18:42.680]  so I kind of limit my public stuff.
[2:18:42.680 --> 2:18:44.680]  Not that I'm afraid, and I don't want to give in to them,
[2:18:44.680 --> 2:18:47.680]  but at the same time it's kind of like, hey, I got kids, I get you don't,
[2:18:47.680 --> 2:18:49.680]  but the name of your book is dangerous.
[2:18:49.680 --> 2:18:51.680]  You're one of the most popular icons out there.
[2:18:51.680 --> 2:18:53.680]  You're only going up because, again, you deserve it.
[2:18:53.680 --> 2:18:58.680]  You're a smart guy, you've got courage to, you know, fortune favors the brave,
[2:18:58.680 --> 2:19:00.680]  the future goes to those that are bold,
[2:19:00.680 --> 2:19:04.680]  and you've definitely taken that flood of fortune.
[2:19:04.680 --> 2:19:07.680]  So you're having a huge event, you're having a huge effect.
[2:19:07.680 --> 2:19:10.680]  My concern is, and I'm glad you're going back to Berkeley,
[2:19:10.680 --> 2:19:13.680]  now you've got, you know, Navy Seal protection and all the rest of it,
[2:19:13.680 --> 2:19:18.680]  but at the same time, these people really hate you because you're really hurting them,
[2:19:18.680 --> 2:19:22.680]  and so I just want to ask you, you know, you're doing these events a couple times a week,
[2:19:22.680 --> 2:19:24.680]  they're trying to kill you basically.
[2:19:24.680 --> 2:19:26.680]  Do you ever just think maybe you're tempting fate?
[2:19:26.680 --> 2:19:28.680]  And again, I admire what you're doing.
[2:19:28.680 --> 2:19:32.680]  I just am kind of in the same boat, so I think I want to come out to Berkeley with Milo
[2:19:32.680 --> 2:19:37.680]  and share in the First Amendment, share in all the attention too to wake folks up, you know,
[2:19:37.680 --> 2:19:41.680]  but at the same time I go, man, you know, God, these are really dangerous scum.
[2:19:41.680 --> 2:19:44.680]  Should I even put myself in the middle of their nest?
[2:19:44.680 --> 2:19:46.680]  Well, I don't blame you.
[2:19:46.680 --> 2:19:48.680]  You have family and you have children to look after.
[2:19:48.680 --> 2:19:52.680]  Going up against the modern progressive left with its heavily organized,
[2:19:52.680 --> 2:19:56.680]  well-funded anarchist shock troops as they show up,
[2:19:56.680 --> 2:19:59.680]  showed up at the inauguration and has now show up to my talks, they show up to three of them.
[2:19:59.680 --> 2:20:01.680]  Yeah, because they're saying kill you.
[2:20:01.680 --> 2:20:02.680]  I mean, yeah.
[2:20:02.680 --> 2:20:05.680]  Well, they say kill Trump, they say kill Milo, they say all sorts of things.
[2:20:05.680 --> 2:20:08.680]  And they also just, I mean, you know, you don't need, this isn't just about property.
[2:20:08.680 --> 2:20:12.680]  I mean, their reports came out that $100,000 worth of Berkeley College property
[2:20:12.680 --> 2:20:16.680]  and $500,000 worth of property in downtown Berkeley were destroyed,
[2:20:16.680 --> 2:20:18.680]  but that for me was not really the big deal.
[2:20:18.680 --> 2:20:19.680]  I mean, all that stuff's in Jewish.
[2:20:19.680 --> 2:20:22.680]  There's women being beaten and then the university defending it.
[2:20:22.680 --> 2:20:27.680]  And pepper spray and the university's response, by the way,
[2:20:27.680 --> 2:20:33.680]  Berkeley's response was to deploy Robert Reich, who was a Clinton staffer, to CNN to say that,
[2:20:33.680 --> 2:20:38.680]  oh, Breitbart did it, they employed these people themselves to come and to beat up their own audiences.
[2:20:38.680 --> 2:20:43.680]  And just the most incredible, I mean, look at you, you've got pictures for your viewers there,
[2:20:43.680 --> 2:20:45.680]  the most incredible outrageous thing.
[2:20:45.680 --> 2:20:48.680]  Newsweek published him saying, University of Berkeley,
[2:20:48.680 --> 2:20:52.680]  republish the Newsweek piece on their own website and then tweeted it.
[2:20:52.680 --> 2:20:56.680]  You know, this is the University of Berkeley basically accusing me and Breitbart
[2:20:56.680 --> 2:21:00.680]  of hiring 150 thugs to beat up our own audiences.
[2:21:00.680 --> 2:21:04.680]  But meanwhile, we have the WikiLeaks of Soros doubling down the number of people he's funding.
[2:21:04.680 --> 2:21:06.680]  So let me ask you this, you're a smart guy.
[2:21:06.680 --> 2:21:08.680]  I mean, I'm not being condescending, you are.
[2:21:08.680 --> 2:21:11.680]  What does your gut tell you where this is going?
[2:21:11.680 --> 2:21:14.680]  Because they're losing power, everything's blowing up in their face.
[2:21:14.680 --> 2:21:19.680]  They're now having Fight Club training to beat up anybody that's libertarian or conservative.
[2:21:19.680 --> 2:21:22.680]  I mean, this is the most fascist behavior you can imagine.
[2:21:22.680 --> 2:21:23.680]  They call us fascists.
[2:21:23.680 --> 2:21:26.680]  Where in your gut does it tell you this is leading?
[2:21:26.680 --> 2:21:29.680]  They want to burn my book while calling us the fascists.
[2:21:29.680 --> 2:21:31.680]  Yeah, it's funny. They don't see the irony.
[2:21:31.680 --> 2:21:34.680]  I think that it's going to get worse before it gets better.
[2:21:34.680 --> 2:21:39.680]  We all just have to stay safe and make sure that we are taking adequate proportions.
[2:21:39.680 --> 2:21:44.680]  It does, by the way, make our lives extremely complicated, very expensive and very cumbersome.
[2:21:44.680 --> 2:21:48.680]  But of course, being libertarians and Republicans, we have real jobs and we can afford it.
[2:21:48.680 --> 2:21:50.680]  And by the way, Milo, we're not being drama queens.
[2:21:50.680 --> 2:21:51.680]  I don't even want to bring myself on air.
[2:21:51.680 --> 2:21:53.680]  I have to have security now.
[2:21:53.680 --> 2:21:56.680]  And I mean, like, you know, the real deal, former Blackwater, you name it.
[2:21:56.680 --> 2:22:01.680]  Because I'll be at a place eating dinner and a leftist will walk over with a gun in their hand.
[2:22:01.680 --> 2:22:05.680]  I mean, they're so pissed and they really think I'm Hitler.
[2:22:05.680 --> 2:22:09.680]  Even though I've never said anything racist and love everybody, they are, it's a damn cult.
[2:22:09.680 --> 2:22:11.680]  I don't know what to do about these people.
[2:22:11.680 --> 2:22:13.680]  Well, I think it's going to get worse before it gets better.
[2:22:13.680 --> 2:22:19.680]  I think, and I have to say, I'm sorry to say this is just to double down on your chilling prophecy.
[2:22:19.680 --> 2:22:23.680]  I do think that something is going to happen to someone and I do think there's going to be a high profile incident.
[2:22:23.680 --> 2:22:27.680]  And when that happens, I think the president will have no choice but to deploy the National Guard,
[2:22:27.680 --> 2:22:32.680]  you know, to protect certain speakers, you know, for the crime of being Republicans or the crime of being libertarians
[2:22:32.680 --> 2:22:35.680]  or the crime really of being anything other than social justice warriors.
[2:22:35.680 --> 2:22:38.680]  Because college campuses won't, you know, college campuses don't even like feminists anymore.
[2:22:38.680 --> 2:22:41.680]  You know, you've got Jermaine Greer, one of the icons of the feminist movement,
[2:22:41.680 --> 2:22:45.680]  cast out from social justice for having the right opinion about transgender people.
[2:22:45.680 --> 2:22:49.680]  It's really anybody who doesn't sign up to the whole catalogue of crazy.
[2:22:49.680 --> 2:22:51.680]  These people are going to have to be protected.
[2:22:51.680 --> 2:22:53.680]  That's key. You've got to sign up to the whole catalogue.
[2:22:53.680 --> 2:22:59.680]  And whenever the latest update like software is, there's a new weekly updates with like a hundred different genders.
[2:22:59.680 --> 2:23:01.680]  And if I don't know them all, I'm a hateful person.
[2:23:01.680 --> 2:23:05.680]  It's so true. It's like, you know, antivirus software, it's always bugging you to update it.
[2:23:05.680 --> 2:23:09.680]  It's like, oh, there's a new pack of virus definitions like every four hours.
[2:23:09.680 --> 2:23:12.680]  And if you don't do it, the software like disables itself or something, that's social justice.
[2:23:12.680 --> 2:23:15.680]  And if you don't have your computer on and click the button every five minutes.
[2:23:15.680 --> 2:23:17.680]  How about people just be loving and do whatever they want.
[2:23:17.680 --> 2:23:19.680]  And then we have a free society.
[2:23:19.680 --> 2:23:24.680]  Well, that is the reason the First Amendment exists to try and create just such a society.
[2:23:24.680 --> 2:23:28.680]  Unfortunately, I think it's going to, as I say, have to get worse before it gets better.
[2:23:28.680 --> 2:23:30.680]  I also think these anti for these black block types.
[2:23:30.680 --> 2:23:33.680]  I mean, as a report came out, the Daily Caller and Breitbart covered this as well.
[2:23:33.680 --> 2:23:39.680]  It was very clear that George Soros had given 50 million to one of the organizations that was involved in protest against me.
[2:23:39.680 --> 2:23:41.680]  So this is in part a Soros thing.
[2:23:41.680 --> 2:23:45.680]  But I think these people, these highly organized, well funded people,
[2:23:45.680 --> 2:23:49.680]  and there are a small number of them and they travel around, they go to all of these things.
[2:23:49.680 --> 2:23:51.680]  150 of them showed up in Berkeley.
[2:23:51.680 --> 2:23:54.680]  These people need to be categorized as what they are, domestic terrorists.
[2:23:54.680 --> 2:23:58.680]  No, they are. They're trying to shut down our free speech and politically intimidate us.
[2:23:58.680 --> 2:24:03.680]  But they're trying to start a fight with 100 million gun owners and the police and military that are away.
[2:24:03.680 --> 2:24:05.680]  I mean, they really are delusional.
[2:24:05.680 --> 2:24:07.680]  What do you think Soros is thinking?
[2:24:07.680 --> 2:24:10.680]  Does Soros have a crush on you?
[2:24:10.680 --> 2:24:12.680]  Is that why he spent 50 million?
[2:24:12.680 --> 2:24:17.680]  That's been leaked. That's public. I mean, 50 million to target Milo.
[2:24:17.680 --> 2:24:19.680]  I mean, I'm flattered, of course.
[2:24:19.680 --> 2:24:22.680]  I've had ex-boyfriends who have done things almost as bonkers.
[2:24:22.680 --> 2:24:27.680]  But look, I think it's just about sowing panic and chaos and fear.
[2:24:27.680 --> 2:24:30.680]  They've realized that they can't get to Trump anymore because now he's the president.
[2:24:30.680 --> 2:24:32.680]  He has the apparatus of the state protecting him.
[2:24:32.680 --> 2:24:35.680]  So it's very difficult for them to physically endanger Donald Trump.
[2:24:35.680 --> 2:24:38.680]  What they can do, which they did at the inauguration, was physically endanger his supporters.
[2:24:38.680 --> 2:24:41.680]  And what they can do is physically endanger me.
[2:24:41.680 --> 2:24:44.680]  That's right. They can target Trump's proxies.
[2:24:44.680 --> 2:24:51.680]  Right. People who like him or people who are spreading words of mischief, dissidence, freedom, whatever it is.
[2:24:51.680 --> 2:24:55.680]  But they really don't like, and this is what all authoritarians hate, is the sound of laughter.
[2:24:55.680 --> 2:24:58.680]  They don't like people having fun while disagreeing.
[2:24:58.680 --> 2:25:02.680]  I agree. They're obsessed with not letting us meet or have our own culture.
[2:25:02.680 --> 2:25:05.680]  That's why you want to tell people, your idea we should do where you have a big party on TV
[2:25:05.680 --> 2:25:08.680]  and just hanging out at the beach and make a big joke out of them?
[2:25:08.680 --> 2:25:11.680]  I think we should. I think we should. I very much love for you to come over.
[2:25:11.680 --> 2:25:14.680]  I'm in my little hideaway in South Florida at the moment.
[2:25:14.680 --> 2:25:18.680]  I think we should go to Miami Beach. I think we should get a big suite on the beach,
[2:25:18.680 --> 2:25:21.680]  have cocktails and have a little Trump party and not live streaming.
[2:25:21.680 --> 2:25:24.680]  No, they'll certainly hate that because you're right. They do hate fun.
[2:25:24.680 --> 2:25:26.680]  I mean, because these aren't the liberals I knew.
[2:25:26.680 --> 2:25:29.680]  Growing up, I liked the liberals I knew that were anti-war.
[2:25:29.680 --> 2:25:32.680]  I think we're cool and they were smart and they knew about the universe.
[2:25:32.680 --> 2:25:36.680]  All those old liberals I know hate the Democrats now and are secret Trump supporters
[2:25:36.680 --> 2:25:39.680]  because the truth is I think Trump's the real liberal.
[2:25:39.680 --> 2:25:41.680]  He wants to give us more of our money and more of our freedom.
[2:25:41.680 --> 2:25:43.680]  He's never done anything. He was against the Iraq war.
[2:25:43.680 --> 2:25:46.680]  He's also an existential threat to political correctness.
[2:25:46.680 --> 2:25:50.680]  He's the one person that I think maybe Trump and I are the two people in America
[2:25:50.680 --> 2:25:53.680]  who have done the most damage to identity politics.
[2:25:53.680 --> 2:25:55.680]  I agree because he makes a joke out of it.
[2:25:55.680 --> 2:25:59.680]  Right. He just doesn't give a hoot. He'll just bulldoze through.
[2:25:59.680 --> 2:26:04.680]  And I am kind of like this massive living, breathing, screaming mascot
[2:26:04.680 --> 2:26:08.680]  about how you could be gay and you don't have to sign up to giving 70% of your money
[2:26:08.680 --> 2:26:10.680]  with the federal government or anything else.
[2:26:10.680 --> 2:26:14.680]  A sexuality has nothing to do with your political opinions.
[2:26:14.680 --> 2:26:16.680]  Sure. You're not letting them speak for you.
[2:26:16.680 --> 2:26:18.680]  You're pointing it out to other people who don't want them to speak for them.
[2:26:18.680 --> 2:26:22.680]  Right. And that shouldn't be a revelation in a country with the First Amendment
[2:26:22.680 --> 2:26:25.680]  that people with a particular sexuality, skin color or gender
[2:26:25.680 --> 2:26:27.680]  don't have to all believe the same stuff.
[2:26:27.680 --> 2:26:29.680]  It shouldn't be a revelation.
[2:26:29.680 --> 2:26:31.680]  Again, that's called a cult. Wouldn't you call the Democrats have become
[2:26:31.680 --> 2:26:35.680]  and liberals worldwide? Like you said, I mean, it's a cult.
[2:26:35.680 --> 2:26:37.680]  It certainly exhibits some cultic behaviors.
[2:26:37.680 --> 2:26:41.680]  I would absolutely agree in terms of the ritualistic kind of behavior on Twitter
[2:26:41.680 --> 2:26:44.680]  in terms of how they treat apostates, you know, how they treat people
[2:26:44.680 --> 2:26:46.680]  who no longer want to be part of the club.
[2:26:46.680 --> 2:26:47.680]  Carrotics.
[2:26:47.680 --> 2:26:50.680]  Yeah, exactly. These are the behaviors of a cult.
[2:26:50.680 --> 2:26:52.680]  Well, let me raise this and then when we come back,
[2:26:52.680 --> 2:26:54.680]  I'm going to bring in another host to ask you a few questions
[2:26:54.680 --> 2:26:56.680]  and I appreciate you giving us so much time.
[2:26:56.680 --> 2:26:59.680]  I know you're really busy. Congratulations on your book being number one.
[2:26:59.680 --> 2:27:01.680]  And I have seen the articles where they want to burn your book.
[2:27:01.680 --> 2:27:04.680]  Once it's in bookstores, you couldn't ask for something better.
[2:27:04.680 --> 2:27:06.680]  I mean, again, let me ask you that then.
[2:27:06.680 --> 2:27:09.680]  Do they know how stupid they look, Milo?
[2:27:09.680 --> 2:27:13.680]  No, I don't think so. I mean, other people have tried in the past
[2:27:13.680 --> 2:27:16.680]  as a guy called Ryan Holiday, who's an observer columnist
[2:27:16.680 --> 2:27:20.680]  who has very successfully trolled people on the left before like Gorka and whatever.
[2:27:20.680 --> 2:27:22.680]  Milo, people couldn't see it as we put up your butt,
[2:27:22.680 --> 2:27:25.680]  but you were like just reveling in the fact they're trying to censor you.
[2:27:25.680 --> 2:27:29.680]  Well, of course, because you know, look, here's a crucial thing.
[2:27:29.680 --> 2:27:32.680]  As New York Magazine admitted last week,
[2:27:32.680 --> 2:27:34.680]  and as I said on Tucker Carlson on Fox last week,
[2:27:34.680 --> 2:27:39.680]  I don't hold any particularly controversial opinions.
[2:27:39.680 --> 2:27:41.680]  I say them in controversial ways.
[2:27:41.680 --> 2:27:43.680]  I make jokes about people you're not supposed to make jokes about
[2:27:43.680 --> 2:27:44.680]  and I like to have...
[2:27:44.680 --> 2:27:46.680]  Well, that's the most protected speech.
[2:27:46.680 --> 2:27:48.680]  Of course. Of course it is.
[2:27:48.680 --> 2:27:52.680]  I'm a comedian. I like to provoke and I like to make people laugh and make people think.
[2:27:52.680 --> 2:27:56.680]  But I don't have any opinions that millions of ordinary Americans don't share.
[2:27:56.680 --> 2:28:00.680]  I just convey them in a more persuasive and funny way and on a bigger platform.
[2:28:00.680 --> 2:28:03.680]  And that's why they find me dangerous because I'm persuading people.
[2:28:03.680 --> 2:28:04.680]  I'm winning people over.
[2:28:04.680 --> 2:28:07.680]  Oh, sure. And like you said, you're speaking what everybody else already thinks
[2:28:07.680 --> 2:28:09.680]  and making people realize they're not alone.
[2:28:09.680 --> 2:28:10.680]  That's your real crime.
[2:28:10.680 --> 2:28:13.680]  Right. And when people read this book and they'll read it because of all of the drama
[2:28:13.680 --> 2:28:15.680]  and controversy and censorship,
[2:28:15.680 --> 2:28:19.680]  they will discover actually a very reasonable, agreeable set of principles
[2:28:19.680 --> 2:28:22.680]  that everybody can get behind.
[2:28:22.680 --> 2:28:24.680]  Well, he has a gay man then.
[2:28:24.680 --> 2:28:27.680]  What did you think of Trump waving a rainbow flag telling Republicans
[2:28:27.680 --> 2:28:30.680]  we need to be nice to everybody and be inclusive and everybody's cheering?
[2:28:30.680 --> 2:28:31.680]  I was there at the RNC.
[2:28:31.680 --> 2:28:32.680]  So were you.
[2:28:32.680 --> 2:28:34.680]  The Democrats couldn't bring people together.
[2:28:34.680 --> 2:28:35.680]  It would all be about division.
[2:28:35.680 --> 2:28:37.680]  It was incredible unity.
[2:28:37.680 --> 2:28:39.680]  And then they claim he's a homophobe.
[2:28:39.680 --> 2:28:41.680]  It's just not true.
[2:28:41.680 --> 2:28:44.680]  But just on the facts, you know, I like to put aside feelings in rhetoric
[2:28:44.680 --> 2:28:45.680]  and look at the facts.
[2:28:45.680 --> 2:28:49.680]  On the facts, Trump is the most pro-gay candidate in presidential history.
[2:28:49.680 --> 2:28:52.680]  And I think he's already the most pro-gay president.
[2:28:52.680 --> 2:28:55.680]  I mean, this is the guy who in, you know, the RNC has never happened before.
[2:28:55.680 --> 2:28:57.680]  He put Peter Thiel on stage to say he was proud of being gay
[2:28:57.680 --> 2:28:58.680]  and proud of being a Republican.
[2:28:58.680 --> 2:28:59.680]  Great moment.
[2:28:59.680 --> 2:29:02.680]  And Trump, you know, did the same thing with a little troll, of course,
[2:29:02.680 --> 2:29:04.680]  because it's Trump, you know, it was an LGBTQ.
[2:29:04.680 --> 2:29:06.680]  And you know, he has no idea what that means.
[2:29:06.680 --> 2:29:08.680]  But one of, you know, maybe, I don't know, maybe Steve or something thought
[2:29:08.680 --> 2:29:10.680]  it would be funny to put in the speech just to wind up the left.
[2:29:10.680 --> 2:29:12.680]  And it was funny, you know, because that's how they talk.
[2:29:12.680 --> 2:29:13.680]  We're not how we talk.
[2:29:13.680 --> 2:29:15.680]  But, you know, it was funny.
[2:29:15.680 --> 2:29:18.680]  But, you know, he came straight in and he said he's not going to do anything about gay marriage.
[2:29:18.680 --> 2:29:21.680]  He's not going to change, you know, protections for gay people, for federal employees,
[2:29:21.680 --> 2:29:22.680]  all the rest of it.
[2:29:22.680 --> 2:29:23.680]  You know, Hillary Clinton on the other hand.
[2:29:23.680 --> 2:29:24.680]  Milo, this is a hard break.
[2:29:24.680 --> 2:29:25.680]  Stay there.
[2:29:25.680 --> 2:29:28.680]  We're going to come back and finish up with that because regardless of what you think of the issue,
[2:29:28.680 --> 2:29:31.680]  the media is lying about what Donald Trump's done.
[2:29:31.680 --> 2:29:35.680]  He's unifying America around prosperity and freedom.
[2:29:35.680 --> 2:29:39.680]  And it's a good thing and bringing God back into it and including everybody.
[2:29:39.680 --> 2:29:40.680]  That's why they're so scared.
[2:29:40.680 --> 2:29:42.680]  He is the great unifier.
[2:29:42.680 --> 2:29:45.680]  We're on the march.
[2:29:45.680 --> 2:29:47.680]  The empire's on the run.
[2:29:47.680 --> 2:29:51.680]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[2:29:51.680 --> 2:29:59.680]  We have the new product and enforce life.com bio true selenium.
[2:29:59.680 --> 2:30:02.680]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium.
[2:30:02.680 --> 2:30:10.680]  And just recently we were able to source a certified organic bio available selenium from mustard seed extract.
[2:30:10.680 --> 2:30:15.680]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[2:30:15.680 --> 2:30:18.680]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[2:30:18.680 --> 2:30:22.680]  It helps detoxify selenium is another one of those absolute must haves.
[2:30:22.680 --> 2:30:27.680]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[2:30:27.680 --> 2:30:33.680]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[2:30:33.680 --> 2:30:39.680]  So it really is a all around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[2:30:39.680 --> 2:30:41.680]  I'm taking it now every day.
[2:30:41.680 --> 2:30:42.680]  This is so key.
[2:30:42.680 --> 2:30:44.680]  Bio true selenium is the product.
[2:30:44.680 --> 2:30:46.680]  The best selenium that we could bring you.
[2:30:46.680 --> 2:30:48.680]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.

[2:33:22.680 --> 2:33:40.680]  Living to your doubt, walking so proudly here, once you provoke her, rattling over tail, never begins it, never wants to engage, never surrenders, showing the veins of rage.

[2:34:23.680 --> 2:34:47.680]  We have bubblegum flavor coming in about a month for children who don't like the super strong peppermint and tea tree oil but if you want really strong natural amazing system with nano silver iodine, peppermint oil, xylitol, ground breaking fluoride free formula, be sure and get it at infowarstore.com or call toll 3-888-253-3139.
[2:34:47.680 --> 2:34:56.680]  A lot of other nutraceuticals are also for sale on the site. We did sell out of super blue which is great because that helps fund our operation but people are really looking for this I guess.
[2:34:56.680 --> 2:35:07.680]  And we ordered almost triple the amount. When the bubblegum flavor comes in it'll be triple because we got a limited amount of that. I don't blame kids. I mean this is strong toothpaste.
[2:35:07.680 --> 2:35:23.680]  But this is how we fund our operation. It's $9.95. It's a big old tube of it and I appreciate all your support. We have our methylcobalamin vitamin B12 organic taken out of the tongue. It's the best thing after injections and it's available at infowarstore.com as well, 10% off.
[2:35:23.680 --> 2:35:27.680]  Right now we have the limited edition. It is ending next week. I've got to end it.
[2:35:27.680 --> 2:35:43.680]  Trump is my president red shirt, which we put out before he was president, kind of a portend, an omen and so much more. Hillary for president 2017, the Port George Soros, nano tech body armor, only civilian sellers of this because we've got a lot of friends in the defense department.
[2:35:43.680 --> 2:35:56.680]  Oh yeah, even the CIA called up wanting this. I'm not kidding. You can't make that up. That's how cutting edge info wars is. They're like, does it really stop all these rounds? Yeah man, that's why it's got 5.0 reviews.
[2:35:56.680 --> 2:36:06.680]  I mean, you know, look at the guys we got testing it. I mean, you think you think you think Q ever did anything for the CIA? You think Easter buddies hop around on on Easter?
[2:36:06.680 --> 2:36:20.680]  Anyways, ladies and gentlemen, we have it all infowarstore.com or triple eight two five three three one three nine and we pledge to you as you fund us, we will only become more aggressive in the fight for human liberty.
[2:36:20.680 --> 2:36:31.680]  Now, speaking of more aggressive Milo is our guest. Everybody knows who Milo is. We've been talking so much about this. Kevin Martin, who I hope to get as one of our reporters, great activists on the street as well.
[2:36:31.680 --> 2:36:40.680]  Exposing journey pop in anytime you want Kevin, Kevin Martin dot info Milo before we go any further here in the time we have what else is going on in Milo world.
[2:36:40.680 --> 2:36:48.680]  What give us sneak peeks of what else is going on websites events. What your crystal ball tells you is coming in the future.
[2:36:48.680 --> 2:36:55.680]  Thank you. It's always so confusing. There's so much going on. So I have a very, very big speech that I'm not allowed to tell you yet, but I can tell you about 24 hours.
[2:36:55.680 --> 2:37:08.680]  So keep an on bright bars going to be bright.com slash Milo keep on my Facebook as well. A very, very big speech at the end of this month, which is going to be kind of like the it's going to be what Berkeley should have been before it was canceled by leftist thugs.
[2:37:08.680 --> 2:37:18.680]  It's going to be in Washington DC. It's going to be a very, very big speech at a very, very big event and you'll be able to tune into that live and it will be very heavily covered.
[2:37:18.680 --> 2:37:24.680]  It's going to be a very, very important moment. The week after that, I think we're going to go back to Berkeley. My book comes out a little bit after that.
[2:37:24.680 --> 2:37:33.680]  I'm also going to be doing a commercial tour this year. So if you're not a student and you weren't able to see me on campus and you want to come and see me in a more traditional venue, I'll be doing a tour later in this year as well.
[2:37:33.680 --> 2:37:46.680]  Well, let's talk about censorship and then pop in any time, Kevin Milo. Listen, the media distorted what I said on pizza gate. I never targeted some pizza place. The media focused on that. The internet did that.
[2:37:46.680 --> 2:37:54.680]  I covered what was in the WikiLeaks, all sorts of weird spirit cooking and Alistair Crowley stuff. As long as it's not illegal, whatever that's their issue that they can legally do that.
[2:37:54.680 --> 2:38:05.680]  But there was a lot of other weird stuff and now there's all these big roundups of perverts going on, all these things happening. And then I was on Joe Rogan's experience and it had more views than anybody's ever had.
[2:38:05.680 --> 2:38:13.680]  Broke all records, but Google plays blocked it. We also had some of the other channels block it and they're really trying to censor it.
[2:38:13.680 --> 2:38:26.680]  And Joe's calling me during the breaks going, do you know what's going on? I don't even know what's going on because in this whole fake news cycle, they will make up something we've said. I mean, Megan Kelly, I'm not attacking Megan Kelly, but she took an edited tape.
[2:38:26.680 --> 2:38:34.680]  I talked about Hillary supporting Islamist raping kids and said that I meant that was about some pizza place. I don't know nothing about that.
[2:38:34.680 --> 2:38:50.680]  What is your view overall on that or just on how they say we're fake news and this whole David Brock move to take an agency Trump didn't fund, but Obama did and try to launch this censorship because you were banned off Twitter when we were at the RNC with you.
[2:38:50.680 --> 2:39:04.680]  I mean, you are like the epicenter of this. I wish I was. I wish I wasn't. But I mean, really, we've experienced where they make up what you've said, or you make fun of Ghostbusters, which was a flop, and they ban you because you make fun of a Sony pictures.
[2:39:04.680 --> 2:39:06.680]  I mean, this is dangerous.
[2:39:06.680 --> 2:39:20.680]  Yeah, I mean, you're right. I kind of patient zero some of this stuff. You know, I wrote a bad review of a Ghostbusters didn't like it. And that was Twitter's excuse to pounce because oh, I've criticized a black woman, which apparently is, you know, the highest imaginable crime in America these days.
[2:39:20.680 --> 2:39:39.680]  Look, it was very dumb for the progressive mainstream media to go on this fake news crusade because they are more responsible than anybody else for lying to and lying about the American people and they know it. They were wrong about absolutely everything throughout the entire presidential run.
[2:39:39.680 --> 2:39:58.680]  They were wrong about everything to do with Trump. They were sharing polls. They were manipulating polls. They were outright manipulating polls, like, you know, with a sample bias and stuff like this. And yet they choose to go on a fake news crusade in an effort to damage places like Breitbart, which were very, you know, powerful, very helpful things to
[2:39:58.680 --> 2:40:12.680]  Trump, of course, because, you know, our readers like him as, you know, a lot and we were covering these issues they care about. So they tried to sort of in revenge, if you like, damage the people and outlets that they thought might have helped Trump get in.
[2:40:12.680 --> 2:40:23.680]  Well, with the inevitable result that they have well, they've been yes, but they've also been stung more by this than anybody else. You know, when you've got Trump saying I'm not taking a question from CNN, you're fake news.
[2:40:23.680 --> 2:40:34.680]  You know, CNN is now the subject of like, because they really are the fake news. I mean, I sit here every day, I cover real stuff that's going on. I'm not making Jack crap up. There's so much real stuff, I can't even cover half of it.
[2:40:34.680 --> 2:40:45.680]  Why would I make something up in this credit myself? But you've been on the receiving end of this too. I mean, you know, they just make things up. So Berkeley, for instance, you know, they're trying to justify the violent response.
[2:40:45.680 --> 2:41:00.680]  You said with no evidence, which is totally defamation, that you funded that group of goons that have tried to kill you and others and we're beating women half to death. I mean, when they've been, when they're openly on the leftist website saying go kill Milo.
[2:41:00.680 --> 2:41:14.680]  Right. And this is CNN and Newsweek. This is Robert Reich. He was a Clinton staffer. He was in the Clinton cabinet and now he's a professor at Berkeley. And then they made up that I was planning because I was going to, I was going to launch David, an initiative with David Horowitz, you know,
[2:41:14.680 --> 2:41:32.680]  about sanctuary campuses, you know, the students who come over here who are not really supposed to be in the country. And we were supposed to launch an initiative. They completely made up just out of nowhere that I was planning at Berkeley to start putting the names and photos of illegal students at Berkeley up on the projector during my talk.
[2:41:32.680 --> 2:41:45.680]  I never planned, was never going to happen. I mean, I wouldn't mind doing it, but I just wasn't going to, you know, as it happens, I had no plan of doing that. It's not a terrible idea. Maybe I should have done it, but, but I wasn't planning to do it. And I told them I wasn't planning to do it.
[2:41:45.680 --> 2:41:48.680]  And they ran the stories anyway. They just make things up.
[2:41:48.680 --> 2:42:07.680]  Kevin Martin, you're sitting here. You've done some viral videos out there. We should probably queue up on the ones where he comes up to the lady saying, you know, whites are basically evil and you're like exposing the black lives matter. It's like a KKK group. I mean, here you are witnessing all this. What do you make of it? I mean, they tried to, I mean, stop, stop Milo from speaking.
[2:42:07.680 --> 2:42:18.680]  Well, you know, Alex, I think the biggest thing is here is that they call it, you know, the tolerant left. But what one thing I realized here is that, you know, they call it the tolerant left and that we're accepting to everybody.
[2:42:18.680 --> 2:42:29.680]  But one thing that we would all agree on and that I would argue is that, listen, if you are not a liberal, you're not accepted. Okay, you can be gay, you can be transgender.
[2:42:29.680 --> 2:42:44.680]  You can be black, you can be an immigrant, you can be Muslim. But if you do not talk, walk, think and believe the way they do, you're an outcast. You're an outcast. You're homophobic and islamic phobic and a sexist and a racist.
[2:42:44.680 --> 2:42:56.680]  Oh yeah, I had family call me yesterday and go, they're saying you're a white supremacist on NPR. Is it true? Because they still think news. I'm like, yeah, you ever heard me say something like that? Again, but it shows how desperate they are. Great point. Go ahead.
[2:42:56.680 --> 2:43:17.680]  Yeah, and I think too, with Lamont Hill and CNN calling these mediocre Negroes going to the White House to meet with Donald Trump and saying President Donald Trump saying that, listen, expressing extreme interest in helping solve the race relations.
[2:43:17.680 --> 2:43:22.680]  And by the way, he means to try to bring, you almost say it's real affirmative action. Factories and jobs in, he means it.
[2:43:22.680 --> 2:43:36.680]  He does and it's just sad because my question is, is if Ben Carson and some of the other prominent African-American figures in the community, if they don't represent the African-American people, then what does?
[2:43:36.680 --> 2:43:46.680]  And who's to say that Lamont Hill represents the African-American community? I mean, I honestly think Lamont Hill, I think he should be ashamed of himself. I mean, for me in my book.
[2:43:46.680 --> 2:43:55.680]  Bullying. I wouldn't imagine saying you're gay, you're white, you're black, you're mixed or whatever. You're going to do what I say. That is so cultic, Milo. Great point that he's making.
[2:43:55.680 --> 2:44:04.680]  It's the worst kind of racism, assuming all black people have to think the same. It's the worst kind of sexism, assuming that all women are going to fall in line and think the same.
[2:44:04.680 --> 2:44:13.680]  And, you know, for Lamont Hill to say it's only mediocre Negroes going to the White House, well, Kanye went to the White House. Does he think he's a mediocre Negro? Because I certainly don't.
[2:44:13.680 --> 2:44:16.680]  He's a mediocre one here.
[2:44:16.680 --> 2:44:22.680]  Right. I mean, it's like, you know, getting your identity stripped away from you. You know, they say I'm not gay now. They say Peter Thiel is not gay.
[2:44:22.680 --> 2:44:30.680]  They say, you know, you don't deserve to be a member of the LGBT community. You know, they said that about me and Peter Thiel. And they've said it to us because we have the wrong opinions.
[2:44:30.680 --> 2:44:38.680]  Because we, you know, we believe the wrong things. We actually have our gay identity stripped away from us. It's like, you know, and this is sort of an admission. It's really telling. It's a very important point.
[2:44:38.680 --> 2:44:52.680]  They know that this stuff about, you know, patriarchy, white supremacy is garbage. And the reason you know they know is that when you step out of ideal, out of your ideological box, when you are a gay person who dares to be conservative,
[2:44:52.680 --> 2:45:00.680]  for instance, they try to take the gay bit away from you because they know that it gives you special privileges. They know that being a gay in public life, you can say things other people can't say.
[2:45:00.680 --> 2:45:09.680]  It explodes the entire concept of privilege because it demonstrates that actually if you're a straight white male, you are the least free in public life. You are the least free to express yourself.
[2:45:09.680 --> 2:45:17.680]  Why do you think this was obviously persecution before? Not as much as they say, but it went on. Why then would they then become what they claim they were fighting?
[2:45:17.680 --> 2:45:32.680]  It's really, and then like worse than what they were fighting because it's so vitriolic. It's so aggressive. It wants full control. I mean, normally a bunch of KKK guys just want their trailers and to hang around at like lords over their little area, you know, some little, you know,
[2:45:32.680 --> 2:45:47.680]  crap hole. Instead, they want to rule everything, Milo. It's revenge. It's very simple. It's revenge. And a lot of these movements, and some people don't like it when I say this, but I think it's perfectly true in Black Lives Matter as an example, is a lot of these movements are run by very angry women.
[2:45:47.680 --> 2:45:50.680]  And those women often have had very bad relationships with men.
[2:45:50.680 --> 2:46:02.680]  By the way, Milo, I'm going to apologize to you and I mean this because I remember seeing you like two years ago going a bunch of ugly, fat, crazy women run this and I was like, because I hadn't been out at many demonstrations in years.
[2:46:02.680 --> 2:46:11.680]  I was so busy. I'd seen the new wave. I've been out now the last six months. It's all a bunch and I'm not being mean to white people, but it's true. It's like angry white.
[2:46:11.680 --> 2:46:14.680]  It's angry white lesbians. It really is.
[2:46:14.680 --> 2:46:21.680]  What is going on with the fat, ugly, unattractive? I'm all for lesbians. It's just they need to be lipstick lesbians. But seriously, what? I'm sorry.
[2:46:21.680 --> 2:46:32.680]  What is going on with ugly lesbians, pissed at everybody, stomping around, screaming, effing white male, and then there's all these weird, a few minorities behind them, bowing like they're the God.
[2:46:32.680 --> 2:46:37.680]  What the hell cult is this? So Milo, explain it to me, because you exposed it first. What is going on?
[2:46:37.680 --> 2:46:44.680]  I did see this first and everybody made fun out of me for this, but I have been proven right. I have to say, it's all angry white lesbians.
[2:46:44.680 --> 2:46:49.680]  It's the same in gender studies departments at universities. You know, Black Lives Matter, a lot of... I mean, they're not...
[2:46:49.680 --> 2:47:01.680]  No, I'm going to stop you. Guys, go to my Facebook. I have millions of views. It's Alex Jones at Women's March DC. I sat there for an hour as they screamed, eff you white male, eff you putting burkas on.
[2:47:01.680 --> 2:47:06.680]  It was all old white women, 90%. So you're right. What's going on?
[2:47:06.680 --> 2:47:14.680]  Well, I think that we have told women so many lies for so long. We have really done a disservice to one half of the population.
[2:47:14.680 --> 2:47:25.680]  Look, men are strong and intrepid and, you know, competitive, and they tend to overcome things. And men who are still single in their 30s, you know, they play sports, they play video games,
[2:47:25.680 --> 2:47:32.680]  they retreat into pornography, their own friendships, whatever, they kind of do okay. Women in their 30s who are single don't do as well.
[2:47:32.680 --> 2:47:38.680]  And because we've been lying to women through the tenets of feminists... That's right. Women, men do well in solitary. Women don't.
[2:47:38.680 --> 2:47:45.680]  Women really don't. And there's something better or worse about that. It's just that the sexes are different. You know, they seek for women in different ways.
[2:47:45.680 --> 2:47:50.680]  They're wired slightly differently. And women don't deal as well when they're, you know, in their 30s and they're still alone.
[2:47:50.680 --> 2:47:58.680]  And feminism has done this, you know, after the Second World War, with increased participation in the workforce of women, women started to get more miserable.
[2:47:58.680 --> 2:48:06.680]  Every single survey taken of female happiness since the Second World War shows women getting progressively more unhappy with every single decade that passes.
[2:48:06.680 --> 2:48:11.680]  Now, that cannot be unconnected to the changing role of women in society. Cannot be unconnected.
[2:48:11.680 --> 2:48:18.680]  When they're running a household and with a bunch of kids are happier in the pig, and you know what, outside of that, they are totally freaked out.
[2:48:18.680 --> 2:48:23.680]  I think everyone knows that. But feminism for 30 years has said there's something wrong with that.
[2:48:23.680 --> 2:48:30.680]  Like you're buying into heteropatriarchal institutions and you should be a strong, powerful, independent woman with a career of your own and you can do the baby thing later.
[2:48:30.680 --> 2:48:37.680]  Well, you can't. You can't. And telling women that you can have it all has been awful for everyone, but especially awful for women.
[2:48:37.680 --> 2:48:42.680]  And let's be clear. There are some women that are more alpha than alpha males who are great at business and life and everything.
[2:48:42.680 --> 2:48:46.680]  And those women that want that, that's great. The point is, don't force it on women.
[2:48:46.680 --> 2:48:47.680]  Exactly. Exactly.
[2:48:47.680 --> 2:48:53.680]  Just like I'm like, I don't care if you're gay or straight, don't force any of it. Just let people be free.
[2:48:53.680 --> 2:49:01.680]  Why tell women? You know, why make women? And I think it's the majority of women who want to have babies, who want to have a husband, who want to stay home.
[2:49:01.680 --> 2:49:06.680]  I think it's probably over 50% of women. Why tell those women there's something wrong with them? Why send messages to young women?
[2:49:06.680 --> 2:49:08.680]  And that's what Gloria Steinem and the CIA did.
[2:49:08.680 --> 2:49:11.680]  Exactly. You know, Gloria Steinem definitely did that.
[2:49:11.680 --> 2:49:21.680]  And, you know, and modern feminism now has taken on this really vindictive, mean, spiteful, unpleasant, lesbianic kind of like man hating air, kill all, you know, white men.
[2:49:21.680 --> 2:49:26.680]  No, no, I told the story when you were on Monday. I've been out with friends that have, you know, good looking wives, whatever you're out.
[2:49:26.680 --> 2:49:29.680]  Literally, lesbians come up and try to take your women away from you.
[2:49:29.680 --> 2:49:35.680]  The thing is, they're not ready to get punched in the teeth, though. It's like they're pretending to be men, but they're not.
[2:49:35.680 --> 2:49:42.680]  Well, it's the cry bully thing, you know, like all feminism, they will throw bombs or be obnoxious or aggressive or behave inappropriately.
[2:49:42.680 --> 2:49:50.680]  And in the moment you respond, even 5% in the direction, you know, in their direction, they immediately turn around and play the victim and play the woman card.
[2:49:50.680 --> 2:49:54.680]  You know, it's like, oh, you are shouting at a woman. You are being physically intimidating to a woman.
[2:49:54.680 --> 2:49:58.680]  Yeah, because you were up in my face telling me, you know, that you want to kill all straight white men.
[2:49:58.680 --> 2:50:00.680]  What kind of, what, how did you expect me to respond?
[2:50:00.680 --> 2:50:04.680]  This is another reason they hate me so much. I'm gay. I'll just turn around and say, honey, I will slap you.
[2:50:04.680 --> 2:50:07.680]  We're a big guy too, so they don't want that.
[2:50:07.680 --> 2:50:13.680]  Look at the way, you know, look at the way Hillary Clinton, you know, look at the way Hillary Clinton ran her campaign.
[2:50:13.680 --> 2:50:18.680]  You know, the leftist talking about Donald Trump ran this very, very divisive campaign.
[2:50:18.680 --> 2:50:25.680]  But look at the way Hillary Clinton and Hillary Clinton is, she is exactly like a lot of other politicians do that are on the left.
[2:50:25.680 --> 2:50:30.680]  Victimize everybody. The gays, your victim, transgenders, your victim, blacks, your victim.
[2:50:30.680 --> 2:50:37.680]  And what that does is everybody has a victim mentality. So, and look at the way Hillary Clinton ran her campaign.
[2:50:37.680 --> 2:50:41.680]  It was, everybody was a victim. The gays are victims. The Muslims are victims.
[2:50:41.680 --> 2:50:45.680]  Let's expand on that. She said, vote for me just as I'm a woman.
[2:50:45.680 --> 2:50:52.680]  Wasn't it women that actually elected Trump at the end of the day, the demographics, they got, this was condescending. Milo?
[2:50:52.680 --> 2:50:54.680]  Women came out to vote for Trump.
[2:50:54.680 --> 2:50:56.680]  They did. Huge numbers.
[2:50:56.680 --> 2:51:02.680]  They really came out to vote for Trump. And so, by the way, did, you know, more millennials than anyone imagined.
[2:51:02.680 --> 2:51:07.680]  By the way, an alpha male, a real alpha male, not a fake alpha male who wants to pimp women.
[2:51:07.680 --> 2:51:11.680]  A real alpha male wants to do one thing, deliver to women. Milo, sorry, go ahead.
[2:51:11.680 --> 2:51:14.680]  No, no, they want, he wants to, and also men want to protect women.
[2:51:14.680 --> 2:51:17.680]  They want, you know, they want women to be cherished and loved and treasured.
[2:51:17.680 --> 2:51:21.680]  You know, there's nothing wrong with that. And modern feminism says that's in some way demeaning.
[2:51:21.680 --> 2:51:29.680]  Of course it, yeah, only, only a system, only a belief system as twisted and counterfactual and logical as feminism could be.
[2:51:29.680 --> 2:51:34.680]  Well, every species protects from whales to fish. When the woman's having babies, you better protect them.
[2:51:34.680 --> 2:51:36.680]  I mean, every species protects the women.
[2:51:36.680 --> 2:51:40.680]  Because they're the magic creature that's produced to the new people.
[2:51:40.680 --> 2:51:48.680]  I know, it's, only a system as bonkers as feminism could say that wanting to, to protect and provide for women was in some way demeaning.
[2:51:48.680 --> 2:51:53.680]  Like that's the, I mean, only, only, you know, modern feminism could come up with this.
[2:51:53.680 --> 2:51:58.680]  And the particular atmosphere, the thing I don't like about it as somebody who is interested in free speech and free expression,
[2:51:58.680 --> 2:52:05.680]  is the chilling effect on fact, recent debate and logic of, you know, the atmosphere that's been created around, around men's issues,
[2:52:05.680 --> 2:52:11.680]  the atmosphere that's been created around gender issues in general, where only women are allowed to talk about anything that has to do with sexism.
[2:52:11.680 --> 2:52:15.680]  And if anything negatively affects a man, oh, well, you had a good for 2000 years.
[2:52:15.680 --> 2:52:22.680]  You know, and, and in particular, the language that's used about men in the public square and the sorts of discussions.
[2:52:22.680 --> 2:52:26.680]  It's all very demeaning. It's all like, oh, like men didn't die by the millions in wars.
[2:52:26.680 --> 2:52:29.680]  Then it's like it's men that did the wars. It's the species.
[2:52:29.680 --> 2:52:34.680]  And the fact is men are like the warrior ant of the women.
[2:52:34.680 --> 2:52:38.680]  The whole species is women. You study biology, you realize what a whole fraud the whole thing is.
[2:52:38.680 --> 2:52:44.680]  Do you remember that Hillary quote where she said that war affects women and children, women and children disproportionately,
[2:52:44.680 --> 2:52:49.680]  because they're the ones that lose their husbands.
[2:52:49.680 --> 2:52:54.680]  And then, and just to piggyback off of what you were saying there, Milo, you know, I was down there.
[2:52:54.680 --> 2:52:58.680]  I had the, you know, I had the honor, I guess you would say I had the opportunity to be at.
[2:52:58.680 --> 2:53:02.680]  I was at the woman's march, but I was also at the march for life.
[2:53:02.680 --> 2:53:09.680]  And it's a stark contrast. I mean, I was down there at the woman's march and I know I'm a man and whom I to say this,
[2:53:09.680 --> 2:53:11.680]  but I did not feel empowered when I left there.
[2:53:11.680 --> 2:53:15.680]  I went back to the hotel. I took three showers with bleach and steel wool.
[2:53:15.680 --> 2:53:18.680]  I mean, it was, it was absolutely ridiculous. I did not feel empowered.
[2:53:18.680 --> 2:53:24.680]  And it was a bunch of lesbian, just a lot of angry, angry, angry women.
[2:53:24.680 --> 2:53:32.680]  And so, and I look on the contrast on the flip side with the woman's march, you know, with the march for life.
[2:53:32.680 --> 2:53:36.680]  These women were actually women that were military. They had families. They had businesses.
[2:53:36.680 --> 2:53:37.680]  They were powerful.
[2:53:37.680 --> 2:53:39.680]  And I'm like, wow, this is empowering.
[2:53:39.680 --> 2:53:40.680]  They were powerful.
[2:53:40.680 --> 2:53:45.680]  Take the Trump, take the Trump inauguration, whether you were white or black, the people were beaming.
[2:53:45.680 --> 2:53:48.680]  They were loving. Milo, you want to comment, give your perspective?
[2:53:48.680 --> 2:53:50.680]  I mean, you've been to a Trump rally like I have.
[2:53:50.680 --> 2:53:51.680]  Phenomenal.
[2:53:51.680 --> 2:53:53.680]  How the media reports on Trump rallies.
[2:53:53.680 --> 2:53:54.680]  Phenomenal.
[2:53:54.680 --> 2:53:59.680]  Happy, enthusiastic, everyone's smiling, everyone's singing, everyone's having a good time.
[2:53:59.680 --> 2:54:03.680]  And the only people who are miserable at Trump rallies are the press in the pen at the back.
[2:54:03.680 --> 2:54:06.680]  And Trump is saying these people are slimy and losers and all the rest of it.
[2:54:06.680 --> 2:54:07.680]  And they are, and they deserve it.
[2:54:07.680 --> 2:54:11.680]  That's another issue. You're a, you know, a super successful quote, gay man.
[2:54:11.680 --> 2:54:17.680]  They, you know, they make that part of your life, your main definition at Trump rallies, at tea parties, at Trump events.
[2:54:17.680 --> 2:54:21.680]  Have you, have you been made to feel unwelcome versus how the left makes you feel?
[2:54:21.680 --> 2:54:25.680]  I, the only response is, oh my God, can I have your autograph?
[2:54:25.680 --> 2:54:26.680]  Can we take a selfie?
[2:54:26.680 --> 2:54:28.680]  I mean, and I'll tell you something else as well.
[2:54:28.680 --> 2:54:33.680]  I'll go even further, not just in Trump rallies, but, you know, I've been on a college tour for nine months and I've been everywhere.
[2:54:33.680 --> 2:54:35.680]  I've been to Louisiana, I've been to Texas.
[2:54:35.680 --> 2:54:37.680]  I've been everywhere, man.
[2:54:37.680 --> 2:54:39.680]  You exactly.
[2:54:39.680 --> 2:54:43.680]  I've been everywhere in America, you know, down to the South, all the rest of it.
[2:54:43.680 --> 2:54:46.680]  The worst, the worst that anyone has ever said to me.
[2:54:46.680 --> 2:54:51.680]  And let me tell you, like, sometimes I get out of gas stations like practically in a skirt, you know, because I like to dress ridiculously and all the rest of it.
[2:54:51.680 --> 2:54:58.680]  I, you know, you can imagine me at a truck stop in Louisiana in a, in drag, you know, getting off my tour bus that says dangerous faggot on the side.
[2:54:58.680 --> 2:54:59.680]  And you know what?
[2:54:59.680 --> 2:55:02.680]  The guy came up to me and said, don't agree with everything you do with your lifestyle.
[2:55:02.680 --> 2:55:05.680]  So, but I like some of what you say and I'll pray for you.
[2:55:05.680 --> 2:55:08.680]  That's the worst thing that a conservative has ever said to me in America.
[2:55:08.680 --> 2:55:13.680]  Contrast that with the left, you know, the vindictive, mean, bullying lies from the media.
[2:55:13.680 --> 2:55:15.680]  The, the, the, from the left, what do they do?
[2:55:15.680 --> 2:55:23.680]  Well, Don Lemon, black gay guy on, on CNN, uh, allows somebody to, to, to propagate conspiracy theory about me having my own audience speak now.
[2:55:23.680 --> 2:55:28.680]  Other people on, you know, it's CNN, call me a white supremacist out of nowhere on the base of no evidence.
[2:55:28.680 --> 2:55:30.680]  Something absolutely true.
[2:55:30.680 --> 2:55:33.680]  They do it to you too. That's the response from the left.
[2:55:33.680 --> 2:55:38.680]  That's the response of the left to, to a gay guy who's independent minded and has, you know, some, some ideas.
[2:55:38.680 --> 2:55:42.680]  Exactly. So, so have they gone insane or is there a method of their madness, Milo?
[2:55:42.680 --> 2:55:49.680]  Well, they find me dangerous because, you know, look, nothing I say is particularly outrageous or outside the mainstream opinion.
[2:55:49.680 --> 2:55:53.680]  And here's the thing, none of the jokes I tell are either.
[2:55:53.680 --> 2:56:01.680]  If you think about the jokes that Amy, uh, you know, Amy Schumer or, uh, or Sarah Silverman back in the old days before she contracted feminism.
[2:56:01.680 --> 2:56:04.680]  Um, Margaret Cho, think about the jokes, you know.
[2:56:04.680 --> 2:56:06.680]  Tracted feminism.
[2:56:06.680 --> 2:56:10.680]  Think about all of the jokes that these people used to tell about Jews, about blacks, about Mexicans.
[2:56:10.680 --> 2:56:16.680]  Wasn't it, wasn't it Sarah Silverman who said that she wants to have a non-Mexican boyfriend because she'd like her next sex to be consensual.
[2:56:16.680 --> 2:56:18.680]  Something like that. Funny jokes. I mean, funny, right?
[2:56:18.680 --> 2:56:20.680]  But I don't say anything.
[2:56:20.680 --> 2:56:23.680]  I don't have redneck jokes. I mean, it's like all funny.
[2:56:23.680 --> 2:56:26.680]  I don't say anything more dramatic or unpleasant about that.
[2:56:26.680 --> 2:56:29.680]  I just tell it about groups you're not supposed to laugh at anymore.
[2:56:29.680 --> 2:56:38.680]  Um, and when you combine facts and studies with provocative language and jokes about groups that are supposedly protected by the left, you have a very dangerous combination.
[2:56:38.680 --> 2:56:41.680]  That's why I call my tour dangerous faggots, why my book is called dangerous.
[2:56:41.680 --> 2:56:48.680]  Because nobody can resist the truth wrapped in a good joke and they cannot cope with somebody who is charismatic and funny and interesting,
[2:56:48.680 --> 2:56:52.680]  telling jokes about their precious groups on the basis of facts, logic, studies and reasons.
[2:56:52.680 --> 2:56:56.680]  All right. Well, listen, whether it's this week or whatever, I'm ready to come out there to the report.
[2:56:56.680 --> 2:57:01.680]  I love it. I appreciate your courage and people, you know, we make jokes about this. This is dangerous. Okay.
[2:57:01.680 --> 2:57:07.680]  So Milo, be safe. Your book's number one on Amazon comes out in what, the middle of March?
[2:57:07.680 --> 2:57:09.680]  Yeah, little while, little while.
[2:57:09.680 --> 2:57:13.680]  All right. Well, thank you for the time. And dangerous is the book.
[2:57:13.680 --> 2:57:17.680]  And of course, people can find you at Milo. They can find you on Twitter, Facebook, everywhere.
[2:57:17.680 --> 2:57:21.680]  They're censoring them more and more, though. So realize this, where's the best place to visit?
[2:57:21.680 --> 2:57:26.680]  Well, finally, Google is returning results about me and not chocolate milk when you just put Milo in.
[2:57:26.680 --> 2:57:29.680]  So you can just put Milo in Google now. I'm winning the SEO wars.
[2:57:29.680 --> 2:57:34.680]  But yeah, Facebook, you can look for Milo. Just look for the verified tick and that's the one that's me.
[2:57:34.680 --> 2:57:38.680]  And of course, right by dot com slash Milo, where all the news buying about.
[2:57:38.680 --> 2:57:40.680]  And by the way, whether you love Milo or hate him, I love him.
[2:57:40.680 --> 2:57:43.680]  If he loses his free speech battle, we all lose it together.
[2:57:43.680 --> 2:57:47.680]  They're coming after drugs. You're coming after us. They're coming after everybody.
[2:57:47.680 --> 2:57:50.680]  We got to stand together for free speech Milo. Thank you so much.
[2:57:50.680 --> 2:57:52.680]  Thanks for having me. I'll take it.
[2:57:52.680 --> 2:57:54.680]  Well, that was a powerful order. We'll come back to five more minutes.
[2:57:54.680 --> 2:57:58.680]  My friend, we're going to hand the baton over to Roger Stone is going to be taken over.
[2:57:58.680 --> 2:58:03.680]  Please support this broadcast. And again, whether you're super right wing Christian, I get that.
[2:58:03.680 --> 2:58:05.680]  It doesn't matter. It's all about free speech, folks.
[2:58:05.680 --> 2:58:09.680]  And we've got to come together for basic liberty. We've got to come together for basic prosperity.
[2:58:09.680 --> 2:58:14.680]  We've got to realize the globalist hate Milo because he's reaching out to people that have been under the leftist bondage.
[2:58:14.680 --> 2:58:19.680]  Please get the new toothpaste super blue back in stock with the colloidal silver.
[2:58:19.680 --> 2:58:26.680]  The iodine, all of it made by the biggest manufacturer of organic or fluoride free toothpaste in the country.
[2:58:26.680 --> 2:58:30.680]  M4slife.com or triple a two five three three one three nine.
[2:58:30.680 --> 2:58:34.680]  That's how we find ourselves. We'll be back with the fourth hour. Stay with us.
[2:58:34.680 --> 2:58:39.680]  Big last three hours.
[2:58:39.680 --> 2:59:05.680]  That GCN Live.com today.
[2:59:05.680 --> 2:59:12.680]  That is absolutely proved over and over again.
[2:59:12.680 --> 2:59:17.680]  But wait a second. Remember the double standards crying about how Russia influenced the election?
[2:59:17.680 --> 2:59:21.680]  Well, without voter ID laws, what's to stop that from happening again?
[2:59:21.680 --> 2:59:26.680]  I'm shocked they didn't cry racist against Native Americans when Elizabeth Warren got killed.
[2:59:26.680 --> 2:59:36.680]  Oh wait, that was fake news. The Democratic Party is dead. The double standard party is alive and well.
[2:59:36.680 --> 2:59:57.680]  This is Owen Schreuer for info wars.com.
[2:59:57.680 --> 3:00:11.680]  From the front lines. From the front lines of the information war. It's Alex Jones.
[3:00:11.680 --> 3:00:17.680]  Well, I was a little boy.
[3:00:17.680 --> 3:00:21.680]  It was like the sleep of Odin.
[3:00:21.680 --> 3:00:26.680]  I knew that there were big things coming, but I was only learning getting ready.
[3:00:26.680 --> 3:00:31.680]  Now we have the hammer of the gods.
[3:00:31.680 --> 3:00:35.680]  Can you hide it from the way that world?
[3:00:35.680 --> 3:00:44.680]  Oh mother. Father.
[3:00:44.680 --> 3:00:47.680]  Gonna show her my world.
[3:00:47.680 --> 3:00:52.680]  You know, you look at these enemies we fight. Everything is upside down. Everything is distorted.
[3:00:52.680 --> 3:00:57.680]  Kevin Martin, my friend, I look forward to trying to hire you to be a reporter for us and the great work you're doing.
[3:00:57.680 --> 3:01:03.680]  You just heard Milo, which, you know, the left is totally dominated and controlled people.
[3:01:03.680 --> 3:01:10.680]  They've run these psy-obs against all these confused people. They hate him so much because he is dismantling their system.
[3:01:10.680 --> 3:01:18.680]  But separate from what Milo was saying, other points you're going to be able to know tonight with Leanne McAdoo and David Knight and others and the great crew here.
[3:01:18.680 --> 3:01:23.680]  What are other observations now visiting the Info Wars Central Texas Center?
[3:01:23.680 --> 3:01:31.680]  Well, other observations. You know, I just think, you know, I really like what you're doing here at Info Wars and it's been a real inspiration.
[3:01:31.680 --> 3:01:33.680]  I really appreciate you having me.
[3:01:33.680 --> 3:01:42.680]  I really appreciate it. It's been an inspiration and I think, you know, I'm conservative and I believe in, you know, I'm a god, I'm a Christian.
[3:01:42.680 --> 3:01:43.680]  I am too.
[3:01:43.680 --> 3:01:49.680]  I believe, you know, when I grew up, you know, we hunted, we fish, we played outside, we went to church on Sunday morning.
[3:01:49.680 --> 3:01:56.680]  You know, hard work and honesty was valued and conservative values were always seen as a positive, you know, always seen as a positive.
[3:01:56.680 --> 3:02:02.680]  And I think, you know, as far as race relations and everything, there's definitely a way that we can get the truth out there.
[3:02:02.680 --> 3:02:12.680]  You know, to fellow people, fellow Americans, fellow black Americans, Latin Americans, we're all Americans, you know, and working towards building a community that will inspire the world.
[3:02:12.680 --> 3:02:17.680]  You know, you see there, they call it conservative, telling the truth, working hard, doing what you'll say.
[3:02:17.680 --> 3:02:21.680]  That's it a premium. I don't care what color you are or what gender you are.
[3:02:21.680 --> 3:02:25.680]  If you're honorable and will bust your ass, everybody wants you.
[3:02:25.680 --> 3:02:26.680]  Amen.
[3:02:26.680 --> 3:02:28.680]  And they teach the left just to like not act like that.
[3:02:28.680 --> 3:02:34.680]  So they'll be losers so they can control you and make you want government as your, as your solution.
[3:02:34.680 --> 3:02:41.680]  Absolutely. And what I saw a lot of people is that, as I see that there's some articles about, you know, Martin Luther King would, you know, would be, you know,
[3:02:41.680 --> 3:02:43.680]  rolling over in his grave right now.
[3:02:43.680 --> 3:02:45.680]  And I'd like to think, no, no, no, he wouldn't.
[3:02:45.680 --> 3:02:49.680]  And I like to think that this is what, this is really what Martin Luther King died for.
[3:02:49.680 --> 3:02:56.680]  Martin Luther King's dream was that a man would be judged by the content of his character, not by the color of his skin.
[3:02:56.680 --> 3:02:57.680]  We live in a day and age.
[3:02:57.680 --> 3:02:58.680]  That's all I judge people by.
[3:02:58.680 --> 3:03:05.680]  And we live in a day and age where, where for me as an African American, the character in which a man portrays is that by which he will be judged.
[3:03:05.680 --> 3:03:06.680]  Is it not?
[3:03:06.680 --> 3:03:10.680]  And there has never been a time as today is when that is true.
[3:03:10.680 --> 3:03:12.680]  Well, take, take, take my producers and crew back there.
[3:03:12.680 --> 3:03:15.680]  A couple of folks are white, Hispanic, black, whatever.
[3:03:15.680 --> 3:03:17.680]  I don't look at what color they are.
[3:03:17.680 --> 3:03:18.680]  It's do they perform?
[3:03:18.680 --> 3:03:19.680]  Are they smart?
[3:03:19.680 --> 3:03:20.680]  Are they funny?
[3:03:20.680 --> 3:03:21.680]  They get the job done.
[3:03:21.680 --> 3:03:24.680]  And that's literally all I care about is they're going to be successful.
[3:03:24.680 --> 3:03:26.680]  I'm going to be successful.
[3:03:26.680 --> 3:03:28.680]  I literally do not.
[3:03:28.680 --> 3:03:29.680]  I am colorblind.
[3:03:29.680 --> 3:03:30.680]  It's really true.
[3:03:30.680 --> 3:03:38.680]  The problem is they, they project this whole color system to control people and we need to just transcend it.
[3:03:38.680 --> 3:03:39.680]  Absolutely.
[3:03:39.680 --> 3:03:40.680]  Absolutely.
[3:03:40.680 --> 3:03:41.680]  Absolutely.
[3:03:41.680 --> 3:03:42.680]  And I think we can.
[3:03:42.680 --> 3:03:43.680]  I've said this many times.
[3:03:43.680 --> 3:03:45.680]  Do you listen to music as to what color somebody is?
[3:03:45.680 --> 3:03:46.680]  No.
[3:03:46.680 --> 3:03:47.680]  Absolutely not.
[3:03:47.680 --> 3:03:49.680]  You like, you go to eat a restaurant because what color they are that on it?
[3:03:49.680 --> 3:03:50.680]  Absolutely not.
[3:03:50.680 --> 3:03:51.680]  Because it's good food.
[3:03:51.680 --> 3:03:52.680]  Absolutely.
[3:03:52.680 --> 3:03:55.680]  I mean, I'll drive way over to East Austin, some black soul kitchens.
[3:03:55.680 --> 3:03:58.680]  They got the best chicken fries staying in color greens out there.
[3:03:58.680 --> 3:04:00.680]  I don't give a damn what color they are.
[3:04:00.680 --> 3:04:03.680]  I'm going over because they got the best tasting food.
[3:04:03.680 --> 3:04:04.680]  Absolutely.
[3:04:04.680 --> 3:04:08.680]  And I think even, even for me, you know, you know, and some people would say that I don't represent.
[3:04:08.680 --> 3:04:10.680]  I don't represent the African-American community.
[3:04:10.680 --> 3:04:11.680]  They're lying.
[3:04:11.680 --> 3:04:12.680]  You represent humanity.
[3:04:12.680 --> 3:04:13.680]  Exactly.
[3:04:13.680 --> 3:04:16.680]  And I am, you know, and I am African-American and I'm an American.
[3:04:16.680 --> 3:04:17.680]  You know, I'm an American first.
[3:04:17.680 --> 3:04:24.680]  You know, and what I just say here is, you know, a lot of people just are, it's that victim mentality.
[3:04:24.680 --> 3:04:26.680]  You know, we have, the left has victimized.
[3:04:26.680 --> 3:04:28.680]  They just want to be chip on the shoulder failure.
[3:04:28.680 --> 3:04:32.680]  You know, the left has victimized the African-American community for so many years.
[3:04:32.680 --> 3:04:33.680]  Victims, victims, victims.
[3:04:33.680 --> 3:04:37.680]  You know, I wake up in the morning and I say, wow, I'm an American.
[3:04:37.680 --> 3:04:38.680]  I'm an American.
[3:04:38.680 --> 3:04:39.680]  You know, I...
[3:04:39.680 --> 3:04:40.680]  Well, let's just not just say this.
[3:04:40.680 --> 3:04:42.680]  You got a powerful soul.
[3:04:42.680 --> 3:04:45.680]  And that's why they particularly try to suppress black people because they don't want that,
[3:04:45.680 --> 3:04:46.680]  humanity's got power.
[3:04:46.680 --> 3:04:48.680]  They don't want that power turned loose.
[3:04:48.680 --> 3:04:49.680]  All right.
[3:04:49.680 --> 3:04:51.680]  Coming up, Roger Stone, straight ahead.
[3:04:51.680 --> 3:04:52.680]  Great job, my friend.
[3:04:52.680 --> 3:04:53.680]  Good to have you here with us.
[3:04:53.680 --> 3:04:54.680]  Thank you.
[3:04:54.680 --> 3:04:55.680]  Nice to be here.
[3:04:55.680 --> 3:04:56.680]  We'll be back.
[3:04:56.680 --> 3:04:57.680]  Stay with us.
[3:04:57.680 --> 3:04:59.680]  Radiation in Fukushima has reached unprecedented levels.
[3:04:59.680 --> 3:05:03.680]  News has been breaking for days now that radiation levels inside the damaged nuclear reactor
[3:05:03.680 --> 3:05:06.680]  are at their highest point since the meltdown in 2011.
[3:05:06.680 --> 3:05:11.680]  Tokyo Electric Power, or TEPCO, has said that readings as high as 530 seabirds an hour have
[3:05:11.680 --> 3:05:16.680]  been recorded inside of nuclear reactor number two, one of the three failing reactors, that's
[3:05:16.680 --> 3:05:17.680]  100 times the fatal level.
[3:05:17.680 --> 3:05:21.680]  This increase is quite alarming, considering the previous high was 73 seabirds an hour,
[3:05:21.680 --> 3:05:23.680]  a 700 percent increase.
[3:05:23.680 --> 3:05:27.680]  The hypothesis for the increased levels at this point is that nuclear fuel melted a hole
[3:05:27.680 --> 3:05:28.680]  through a containment vessel.
[3:05:28.680 --> 3:05:32.680]  These increased levels of radiation will make cleanup even more difficult, considering
[3:05:32.680 --> 3:05:36.680]  the most advanced robot for the assignment can only last two hours in the atmosphere before
[3:05:36.680 --> 3:05:37.680]  failing.
[3:05:37.680 --> 3:05:41.680]  Estimated cost of cleanup, if possible, is said to have doubled, but let's be honest,
[3:05:41.680 --> 3:05:43.680]  the cost of this is immeasurable.
[3:05:43.680 --> 3:05:46.680]  This meltdown has already severely crippled marine life in the Pacific Ocean.
[3:05:46.680 --> 3:05:50.680]  The protesters in the mainstream news are still silent on this issue.
[3:05:50.680 --> 3:06:16.680]  Go and Shroyer for Infowars.com.

[3:08:18.680 --> 3:08:24.680]  Welcome back to Infowars. I'm Roger Stone, sitting in for my friend Alex Jones.
[3:08:24.680 --> 3:08:31.680]  It is an exciting time to be alive, and it's an exciting time to be in Washington.
[3:08:31.680 --> 3:08:36.680]  Joining me now is a veteran of the Reagan Revolution.
[3:08:36.680 --> 3:08:42.680]  Ed Martin is a former Republican state chairman of Missouri, former chief of staff to the
[3:08:42.680 --> 3:08:51.680]  Missouri governor, a candidate for attorney general of Missouri, the right-hand man to
[3:08:51.680 --> 3:08:58.680]  Phyllis Schlafly, the beloved conservative icon, but more importantly than all of that,
[3:08:58.680 --> 3:09:05.680]  really a key man for Donald Trump in Missouri, and a key man for Donald Trump at the
[3:09:05.680 --> 3:09:13.680]  Republican National Convention because Ed is a master of the rules process, the credentials
[3:09:13.680 --> 3:09:19.680]  process, and always has been stalwart on the platform.
[3:09:19.680 --> 3:09:21.680]  Ed Martin, welcome to Infowars.
[3:09:21.680 --> 3:09:23.680]  Great to be with you, Roger. Thank you.
[3:09:23.680 --> 3:09:25.680]  I want to point out you said icon.
[3:09:25.680 --> 3:09:29.680]  If you look over my shoulder, I guess right there, you'll see there's an icon of Judas
[3:09:29.680 --> 3:09:32.680]  and Jesus. I like to keep that in close proximity.
[3:09:32.680 --> 3:09:36.680]  You just want to remember there's always Judas around the corner.
[3:09:36.680 --> 3:09:38.680]  But good to be with you anyway. Great to see you, Roger.
[3:09:38.680 --> 3:09:41.680]  Well, in our business, there's a lot of Judas.
[3:09:41.680 --> 3:09:48.680]  I want to talk to you today about a phenomena that has always existed in politics, and that's
[3:09:48.680 --> 3:09:56.680]  the leak. The strategic leak is a part of the Machiavellian tool of tricks in politics.
[3:09:56.680 --> 3:10:04.680]  However, when employees, when staffers leak against the best interests of their boss,
[3:10:04.680 --> 3:10:10.680]  in this case the President of the United States, I think they're doing themselves an enormous
[3:10:10.680 --> 3:10:18.680]  disservice. I have been very angry and shocked to read White House staffers quoted in the
[3:10:18.680 --> 3:10:22.680]  Washington Post as saying, the President is a clueless child.
[3:10:22.680 --> 3:10:23.680]  Right.
[3:10:23.680 --> 3:10:29.680]  I have been unhappy to read The New York Times that the President wears a bathrobe in his
[3:10:29.680 --> 3:10:36.680]  leisure hours. That's his business. The White House is drafty. Who wouldn't?
[3:10:36.680 --> 3:10:44.680]  The who's in, who's up, who's down drama of what's going on around the President has
[3:10:44.680 --> 3:10:50.680]  caused some people to leak, not to help their boss, but try to enhance their own position.
[3:10:50.680 --> 3:10:56.680]  I object to that kind of leaking. I think the President is really being badly served,
[3:10:56.680 --> 3:10:58.680]  and I want to explore this phenomena.
[3:10:58.680 --> 3:11:06.680]  Now, you are a very skillful and experienced hand at government and politics.
[3:11:06.680 --> 3:11:12.680]  Early Trump, a key player, I know that the President has great affection for you.
[3:11:12.680 --> 3:11:16.680]  I know Steve Bannon has great affection for you.
[3:11:16.680 --> 3:11:22.680]  I know how you had to fight the cruise bots at Eagle Forum.
[3:11:22.680 --> 3:11:26.680]  I would have surely thought that you would have joined this administration.
[3:11:26.680 --> 3:11:33.680]  I know that you are willing, and it disappoints me that instead we have an administration,
[3:11:33.680 --> 3:11:39.680]  at least on the White House staff side, that is largely people who never supported Donald
[3:11:39.680 --> 3:11:40.680]  Trump.
[3:11:40.680 --> 3:11:45.680]  Well, first of all, let me tell you, Roger, there's a lot there unpacked.
[3:11:45.680 --> 3:11:46.680]  First of all, the leaks.
[3:11:46.680 --> 3:11:47.680]  I do want to talk about that.
[3:11:47.680 --> 3:11:51.680]  I mean, there's a phrase that a friend of mine used that I use repeatedly, and that
[3:11:51.680 --> 3:11:55.680]  is that people are waiting for Donald Trump to stumble.
[3:11:55.680 --> 3:11:59.680]  When Donald Trump stumbles, there will be lots of people there to hold him down.
[3:11:59.680 --> 3:12:02.680]  I think that's the problem we see.
[3:12:02.680 --> 3:12:05.680]  We are seeing the establishment and the media on the left.
[3:12:05.680 --> 3:12:07.680]  They are slow walking nominees.
[3:12:07.680 --> 3:12:09.680]  They are leaking things out of the White House.
[3:12:09.680 --> 3:12:14.680]  This is a recipe to hold the President back and cause him to rethink things.
[3:12:14.680 --> 3:12:19.680]  Now, look, I was chief of staff to the governor of the state of Missouri, and I can tell you
[3:12:19.680 --> 3:12:26.680]  that the plan for any establishment and the ruling class is to leak in order to freeze
[3:12:26.680 --> 3:12:28.680]  effective staffers out.
[3:12:28.680 --> 3:12:33.680]  And to your point, one of the things I see with President Trump that I worry about is
[3:12:33.680 --> 3:12:37.680]  any principle with a governor, president, even Phyllis when she was here, when she's
[3:12:37.680 --> 3:12:43.680]  running things, they have so much going on that you have to have staff that's loyal
[3:12:43.680 --> 3:12:45.680]  to the vision and to the man.
[3:12:45.680 --> 3:12:50.680]  And if you have people around you that are loyal to the next job they're looking for
[3:12:50.680 --> 3:12:55.680]  in the next administration or the next Republican National Committee post or whatever it is,
[3:12:55.680 --> 3:12:56.680]  it's a real problem.
[3:12:56.680 --> 3:13:00.680]  And I think that's what most people are wondering with this president is, you know,
[3:13:00.680 --> 3:13:05.680]  is he really finding that the people that are around him are cutting off not just the
[3:13:05.680 --> 3:13:08.680]  knees of him, another one they're doing, you mentioned Bannon.
[3:13:08.680 --> 3:13:13.680]  But whenever the press conspires with the media, excuse me, the media conspires with
[3:13:13.680 --> 3:13:17.680]  the establishment to identify someone as powerful, it's a game.
[3:13:17.680 --> 3:13:20.680]  They're trying to freeze the person and cause doubt and cause problems.
[3:13:20.680 --> 3:13:22.680]  So there's a lot of things going on.
[3:13:22.680 --> 3:13:27.680]  And I will say that none of it's a surprise because you and I both know that the establishment
[3:13:27.680 --> 3:13:32.680]  has a way of seeping into every administration, whether it was Reagan, even, you know,
[3:13:32.680 --> 3:13:35.680]  Nixon, you could talk about, but it is worrying.
[3:13:35.680 --> 3:13:37.680]  And I think we have to double down.
[3:13:37.680 --> 3:13:42.680]  I just went to lunch with a guy who's a blue collar, electrician type.
[3:13:42.680 --> 3:13:48.680]  And he just said, Ed, I'll do anything anywhere to stop these protests that are so fake to
[3:13:48.680 --> 3:13:50.680]  stop the media and to fight back.
[3:13:50.680 --> 3:13:52.680]  And that's what the president won on.
[3:13:52.680 --> 3:13:53.680]  He won on that energy.
[3:13:53.680 --> 3:13:56.680]  And we have to kind of connect that for him.
[3:13:56.680 --> 3:14:00.680]  And I think there's lots of reasons to worry and be concerned.
[3:14:00.680 --> 3:14:02.680]  But as my wife said the other night, she said, I don't know.
[3:14:02.680 --> 3:14:06.680]  She said, the president is just amazing how he does these things.
[3:14:06.680 --> 3:14:09.680]  We have to shake our head, but it is a concern.
[3:14:09.680 --> 3:14:13.680]  Well, Ed, and I'm not implying that you are looking for a job.
[3:14:13.680 --> 3:14:15.680]  It just shocks me that you have not been recruited.
[3:14:15.680 --> 3:14:19.680]  And I know you would serve your country if you were called upon.
[3:14:19.680 --> 3:14:25.680]  You know, it occurs to me that when Ronald Reagan selected Jim Baker, who had been George
[3:14:25.680 --> 3:14:31.680]  Bush's campaign manager for his chief of staff, Baker very wisely reached out immediately
[3:14:31.680 --> 3:14:38.680]  to a number of key Reaganites like Faith Whittlesey and Lin Noffsinger and others and hired them
[3:14:38.680 --> 3:14:44.680]  for high level White House positions, thus tamping down any criticism of him for staffing
[3:14:44.680 --> 3:14:46.680]  the place with infidels.
[3:14:46.680 --> 3:14:49.680]  Right's previous sadly has not done that.
[3:14:49.680 --> 3:14:56.680]  There are outstanding men and women from the Trump campaign with vast experience who are very capable.
[3:14:56.680 --> 3:15:02.680]  But sadly, the White House appears to be staffed with party functionaries.
[3:15:02.680 --> 3:15:05.680]  They have no loyalty to Donald Trump.
[3:15:05.680 --> 3:15:08.680]  And this is where the leaks I fear are coming from.
[3:15:08.680 --> 3:15:11.680]  This is very damaging.
[3:15:11.680 --> 3:15:17.680]  You know, Roger, a couple things on that is one, you know, when Donald Trump won his election,
[3:15:17.680 --> 3:15:21.680]  there was a couple hundred people on the payroll, you know, in terms of people that were with him
[3:15:21.680 --> 3:15:24.680]  from the beginning, maybe 300 people that were with him.
[3:15:24.680 --> 3:15:27.680]  And a lot of those folks were people that weren't going to move to Washington anyway.
[3:15:27.680 --> 3:15:32.680]  So it would be inevitable that he get people that were not with him from the beginning.
[3:15:32.680 --> 3:15:36.680]  The question is, people that were never Trumpers, you know, they're talking about a never Trumper
[3:15:36.680 --> 3:15:41.680]  trying to be the number two guy in the Defense Department, the never Trumpers in the State Department.
[3:15:41.680 --> 3:15:46.680]  I mean, you and I were there when we were standing for Donald Trump and when he was standing for America,
[3:15:46.680 --> 3:15:50.680]  the viciousness that came at people because of that.
[3:15:50.680 --> 3:15:54.680]  It's hard to say you can forgive a lot of things.
[3:15:54.680 --> 3:15:57.680]  But some of this you have to remember in terms of the quality of the judgment.
[3:15:57.680 --> 3:16:03.680]  And you know, one of the things out in Montana, one of my friends started a website called TrumpTrue.org.
[3:16:03.680 --> 3:16:08.680]  And on that site, he just posts so everyone can remember who the never Trumpers were,
[3:16:08.680 --> 3:16:12.680]  who said terrible things about the president, not because you're going to never hire them,
[3:16:12.680 --> 3:16:17.680]  but because you got to remember those are probably the people that are going to be the ones that turn on you,
[3:16:17.680 --> 3:16:20.680]  that leak on you, that betray things.
[3:16:20.680 --> 3:16:27.680]  So, look, I think what you do, what I do is to help make Trump, make the president give him more,
[3:16:27.680 --> 3:16:30.680]  support him more and call people what they are and be clear.
[3:16:30.680 --> 3:16:33.680]  But it's a concern. I think we all see that now.
[3:16:33.680 --> 3:16:39.680]  One of the things that is hard for me to understand is how the president's chief of staff,
[3:16:39.680 --> 3:16:46.680]  Ryan Priebus, seems to spend every waking hour with the president like a body man.
[3:16:46.680 --> 3:16:52.680]  It is not possible to run the White House staff and make the cranes run on time
[3:16:52.680 --> 3:16:57.680]  if you are serving as a supernumerary body man for the president of the United States.
[3:16:57.680 --> 3:17:01.680]  Now, I call him the man who needs to be in every room.
[3:17:01.680 --> 3:17:07.680]  Bob Haldeman wrote in his diary how difficult it was that Nixon wanted him to come in and use
[3:17:07.680 --> 3:17:10.680]  for a couple of hours on politics or policy.
[3:17:10.680 --> 3:17:15.680]  And Haldeman just kept looking at his watch, wanting to get back to his desk to make the government run.
[3:17:15.680 --> 3:17:17.680]  And what a problem this was.
[3:17:17.680 --> 3:17:23.680]  So, it's very hard to understand how he can function doing the job this way.
[3:17:23.680 --> 3:17:30.680]  Steve Bannon, who I think is the keeper of the Trump flame in terms of the message,
[3:17:30.680 --> 3:17:35.680]  first of all, it's insulting to say that Bannon is Trump's brain.
[3:17:35.680 --> 3:17:37.680]  Bannon is the de facto president.
[3:17:37.680 --> 3:17:42.680]  Those things are being said by detractors of Bannon seeking to undermine him.
[3:17:42.680 --> 3:17:49.680]  The president and Steve Bannon are copacetic on issues, that they share the same worldview.
[3:17:49.680 --> 3:17:51.680]  This is shocking.
[3:17:51.680 --> 3:17:57.680]  These are Trump's ideas that Steve Bannon, who is not elected president, agrees with.
[3:17:57.680 --> 3:17:59.680]  This is how they became friends.
[3:17:59.680 --> 3:18:02.680]  This is how he was recruited into the campaign.
[3:18:02.680 --> 3:18:06.680]  So, those are meant to hurt him.
[3:18:06.680 --> 3:18:10.680]  Mr. Bannon, in full disclosure, I write for Breitbart.
[3:18:10.680 --> 3:18:14.680]  He's a friend, and I am a fan, a supporter.
[3:18:14.680 --> 3:18:19.680]  But Mr. Bannon has wisely given no press interviews to speak of,
[3:18:19.680 --> 3:18:25.680]  not trying to hot dog it like so many others in the administration.
[3:18:25.680 --> 3:18:32.680]  But at the end of the day, the issue of who on this staff supported the president
[3:18:32.680 --> 3:18:39.680]  and will live and die for the president, I think is going to come to the fore now.
[3:18:39.680 --> 3:18:41.680]  Listen, Roger, let me tell you, let me interrupt you.
[3:18:41.680 --> 3:18:43.680]  The key to this is what you said.
[3:18:43.680 --> 3:18:46.680]  Leadership and governing are very difficult.
[3:18:46.680 --> 3:18:49.680]  When I first became chief of staff to the governor, I had a friend tell me,
[3:18:49.680 --> 3:18:53.680]  if you try to hold on to power, it's like sand.
[3:18:53.680 --> 3:18:55.680]  If you grab it tight, you're going to lose it.
[3:18:55.680 --> 3:18:58.680]  It's going to slip through your fingers if you grab it too tight.
[3:18:58.680 --> 3:19:01.680]  You have to hold it with your hands open.
[3:19:01.680 --> 3:19:05.680]  And what you see, I think, with guys that have never been in government,
[3:19:05.680 --> 3:19:08.680]  government's not important, but then CEOs of operations.
[3:19:08.680 --> 3:19:10.680]  You know, running the RNC is an interesting job.
[3:19:10.680 --> 3:19:12.680]  But it's not a CEO job.
[3:19:12.680 --> 3:19:13.680]  It's not chief of staff.
[3:19:13.680 --> 3:19:14.680]  No, it's not an executive.
[3:19:14.680 --> 3:19:16.680]  We've got to leave it there, unfortunately.
[3:19:16.680 --> 3:19:20.680]  Ed Martin, a true Trumpite.
[3:19:20.680 --> 3:19:23.680]  Thanks for joining us here at infowars.com.
[3:19:23.680 --> 3:19:25.680]  OK, Roger, keep in touch.
[3:19:25.680 --> 3:19:54.680]  Many thanks.
[3:19:55.680 --> 3:19:57.680]  Guys, are you tired of being tired?
[3:19:57.680 --> 3:20:01.680]  Frustrated because it seems impossible to lose belly fat.
[3:20:01.680 --> 3:20:04.680]  If you're looking for a solution, then listen to Mark.
[3:20:04.680 --> 3:20:10.680]  I had fantastic results with the Andro 400 Mac, probably lost 35 pounds.
[3:20:10.680 --> 3:20:16.680]  And more impressive than that was the inches I lost off of my belly and my waist.
[3:20:16.680 --> 3:20:18.680]  And the increased energy is fantastic.
[3:20:18.680 --> 3:20:19.680]  I'll be totally honest.
[3:20:19.680 --> 3:20:24.680]  I tried a different product and I wasn't happy with the different product.
[3:20:24.680 --> 3:20:27.680]  You guys are considerably cheaper than the other brand.
[3:20:27.680 --> 3:20:54.680]  And I can really feel the difference.
[3:20:54.680 --> 3:21:00.680]  Happy Valentine's Day, honey.
[3:21:00.680 --> 3:21:03.680]  I couldn't let Valentine's Day come and go without surprising you with flowers.
[3:21:03.680 --> 3:21:04.680]  Oh, thank you.

[3:24:07.680 --> 3:24:10.680]  Welcome back to InfoWars.
[3:24:10.680 --> 3:24:17.680]  My wife, Nadia Stone, is one of those women who has the most gleaming white teeth you've ever seen.
[3:24:17.680 --> 3:24:19.680]  And I asked her how.
[3:24:19.680 --> 3:24:25.680]  And then I learned that taking my advice about the InfoWars store products,
[3:24:25.680 --> 3:24:31.680]  that she had been using the super blue fluoride toothpaste, which is now back in stock.
[3:24:31.680 --> 3:24:33.680]  She swears by this.
[3:24:33.680 --> 3:24:40.680]  My wife is a stealth believer in oral health and she has always had magnificent teeth.
[3:24:40.680 --> 3:24:44.680]  So I recommend the product to you because she likes it.
[3:24:44.680 --> 3:24:50.680]  And when you buy on the InfoWars store, you're helping the cause.
[3:24:50.680 --> 3:24:58.680]  You're helping finance the resistance to the globalists and those who would now seek to undo the Trump revolution.
[3:24:58.680 --> 3:25:03.680]  So it's win-win. Go to theinfowars.com store.
[3:25:03.680 --> 3:25:07.680]  This is also a big week for my friend Milo.
[3:25:07.680 --> 3:25:12.680]  I saw Milo on Fox with my other friend, Judge Janine Pirro.
[3:25:12.680 --> 3:25:17.680]  And he was sporting a new kind of chestnut-haired look.
[3:25:17.680 --> 3:25:24.680]  Now, the last time he was in New York, we got together for an epic night of revelry.
[3:25:24.680 --> 3:25:30.680]  And I can tell you that at least at that point, Blondes definitely had more fun.
[3:25:30.680 --> 3:25:37.680]  This is a terrific book, dangerous, and the way that Milo aggravates the establishment
[3:25:37.680 --> 3:25:46.680]  and aggravates the phony academics who like free speech as long as it's theirs just tickles me.
[3:25:46.680 --> 3:25:55.680]  If you are a follower of Stone On Style, you know that every New Year's Day,
[3:25:55.680 --> 3:26:01.680]  I present the list of the very best and worst dressed people in the world.
[3:26:01.680 --> 3:26:06.680]  It's called Mr. Stone's International Best and Worst Dressed List.
[3:26:06.680 --> 3:26:15.680]  Milo has now made the list for two years as one of the most interesting and dapper gents
[3:26:15.680 --> 3:26:17.680]  in the world.
[3:26:17.680 --> 3:26:23.680]  And he is one who sets a sartorial mark for the rest of us.
[3:26:23.680 --> 3:26:25.680]  Get his book.
[3:26:25.680 --> 3:26:33.680]  I was privileged to be interviewed by Jeff Glock on the Charlie Rose show last night.
[3:26:33.680 --> 3:26:39.680]  Comes news today that Charlie Rose, who I've known for many years, may require heart surgery.
[3:26:39.680 --> 3:26:44.680]  So our best wishes to Charlie Rose for a speedy recovery.
[3:26:44.680 --> 3:26:48.680]  We talked about my book, The Making of the President 2016.
[3:26:48.680 --> 3:26:54.680]  It was a lively interview in the true Charlie Rose style.
[3:26:54.680 --> 3:27:04.680]  I got an aggressive questioning from Jeff Glock who himself may be on next year's best dressed list.
[3:27:04.680 --> 3:27:07.680]  He cuts quite a figure.
[3:27:07.680 --> 3:27:11.680]  The other two interesting things about New York are a bit strange.
[3:27:11.680 --> 3:27:21.680]  There was a demonstration outside of the Trump Tower in which a small number, say 50, Trump supporters were chanting and holding signs.
[3:27:21.680 --> 3:27:23.680]  It was very cold.
[3:27:23.680 --> 3:27:29.680]  And as people walked by, they would yell various obscenities or other challenging things.
[3:27:29.680 --> 3:27:38.680]  But at the end of this, as I was just passing by, there was an older black gentleman looking at the demonstrator, shaking his head and simply saying,
[3:27:38.680 --> 3:27:44.680]  you're all in the stone zone. You're in the stone zone. There's something wrong with you. You're in the stone zone.
[3:27:44.680 --> 3:27:48.680]  So, sir, thank you so very much.
[3:27:48.680 --> 3:27:51.680]  The other event was even spookier.
[3:27:51.680 --> 3:27:57.680]  I was on Lexington Avenue right after I had taped the Charlie Rose show.
[3:27:57.680 --> 3:28:07.680]  And I went into a New York pizza is, of course, the best, with the exception of Haven, Connecticut, the best on the face of the planet.
[3:28:07.680 --> 3:28:17.680]  And while I was enjoying my slice, a woman came in and she looked at me and she said, I feel the pure evil.
[3:28:17.680 --> 3:28:21.680]  I'm drawn by your evil aura, Roger Stone.
[3:28:21.680 --> 3:28:28.680]  I mean, I'm in the presence of Satan. And then she ran out the door screaming. I'm not making any of this up.
[3:28:28.680 --> 3:28:39.680]  This is how sick these liberals are during the campaign, as I think I may have recounted on my radio show, The Stone Cold Truth,
[3:28:39.680 --> 3:28:44.680]  which is on Saturdays from one to three on the Genesis Communications Network.
[3:28:44.680 --> 3:28:50.680]  I was standing in the street corner and a woman who was just perfectly dressed, head to toe, looked at me.
[3:28:50.680 --> 3:28:58.680]  She was wearing Chanel. She was wearing Hermes. She was perfectly coiffed.
[3:28:58.680 --> 3:29:10.680]  She turned spit on me. It dribbled down the front of my lapel and this tolerant liberal cross the street when the light changed.
[3:29:10.680 --> 3:29:14.680]  This is what life is like in Manhattan for the Trump supporters.
[3:29:14.680 --> 3:29:23.680]  Yet Trump remains, despite the fact of his staff problems and the fact that the media wants to create controversy
[3:29:23.680 --> 3:29:28.680]  and problems where there is none, he perseveres on his agenda.
[3:29:28.680 --> 3:29:44.680]  Thanks for joining us at InfoWars. We'll be right back.

[3:33:18.680 --> 3:33:25.680]  Welcome back to Infowars. I'm Roger Stone, sitting in for Alex Jones and glad to be here.
[3:33:25.680 --> 3:33:33.680]  I made reference to my new book, The Making of the President 2016, how Donald Trump orchestrated a revolution in the previous segment.

[3:33:58.680 --> 3:34:04.680]  You can beat back those who would censor us and who would take away our First Amendment rights.
[3:34:04.680 --> 3:34:23.680]  Maybe you can get what I think, and I'm biased, maybe the single best account of the 2016 election. If you want to know how and why Donald Trump was able to pull off the greatest upset in American political history, I really think you're going to enjoy this book.
[3:34:23.680 --> 3:34:40.680]  Now, I want to delve into an issue that Infowars has been very instrumental in helping develop. A terrific piece last week by Dr. Jerry Corsi talks about incredible deeds that are happening in Haiti.
[3:34:40.680 --> 3:34:57.680]  To set the table for this, it's important that viewers remember that in the aftermath of the horrific earthquake that Bill and Hillary Clinton completely dominated the charitable efforts to rebuild that country.
[3:34:57.680 --> 3:35:11.680]  Bill Clinton got himself appointed a special ambassador, and Hillary Clinton as the Secretary of State controlled the federal money for the efforts to rebuild Haiti.
[3:35:11.680 --> 3:35:27.680]  The international effort was largely handled by Bill Clinton, who had a rubber stamp board of cronies controlling the operation on the ground. And sadly, no big contracts were given to those close to the Clintons.
[3:35:27.680 --> 3:35:35.680]  That money disappeared. In fact, almost all of the money disappeared, but no homes were built.
[3:35:35.680 --> 3:35:50.680]  The people of Haiti suffering one of the great natural disasters in the annals of history got no help. What they got was raped, as the money was ripped off by the Clintons and their cronies.
[3:35:50.680 --> 3:36:07.680]  The government that allowed them to do that has struggled now to stay in power, and Donald Trump in the campaign not only criticized the Clinton's rape of Haiti, but vowed to stand up for the Haitian people.
[3:36:07.680 --> 3:36:26.680]  In this most recent election, I have done an analysis of the Haitian-American vote. Although they are small, they are vocal, and they voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump, because they want him to stop the rape of their nation.
[3:36:26.680 --> 3:36:37.680]  What you have there are a few wealthy billionaires extracting the gas and the oil and the minerals, and the people of Haiti are getting nothing.
[3:36:37.680 --> 3:36:57.680]  The things that were built post-earthquake were federally funded in the 20% of Haiti that was unaffected by the hurricane to build a state-of-the-art port so that the government, puppet government, can shift the resources out of the country more efficiently.
[3:36:57.680 --> 3:37:24.680]  Comes now with us, one of my favorite guests, Zill Danto is an attorney, a human rights activist, a writer, a poet, a playwright, and a very articulate advocate for the women and men of Haiti who I was honored to march with in front of the state office building only a week ago.
[3:37:24.680 --> 3:37:28.680]  Zill, thanks for being back with us on InfoWars.
[3:37:28.680 --> 3:37:31.680]  Thank you so much for having me, Roger.
[3:37:31.680 --> 3:38:00.680]  I know that you are in shock, as I am, on the most recent developments. It appears to any objective person that Amarosa Magal, a White House aide of apprentice fame, who is closely tied to the Democratic political consultant Ron Daniels, who is the errand boy for the oligarchs raping Haiti,
[3:38:00.680 --> 3:38:18.680]  have convinced Donald Trump to send a delegation, an official White House delegation, to try to legitimize a government who has stolen its way into power. Tell us what the state of play is and who was in this delegation.
[3:38:18.680 --> 3:38:41.680]  Thank you for asking me, yes. It's a hard blow for us because we had hoped that Donald Trump would be different because he said he would be different. And because we really had no choice, we had 30 years of Bush and Clinton and complete, absolutely destruction of Haiti while they had this fake aid they were taking out our resources.
[3:38:41.680 --> 3:38:56.680]  So the parting gift of the Clintons was a money-laundering, handpicked successor of their puppet president that they put on us during the shock of the earthquake in 2011.
[3:38:56.680 --> 3:39:14.680]  And for the last three months since, you know, November 8th, I've been trying to see who within the Donald Trump administration that we could talk to. Everybody was very busy. And they told us, you know, he definitely didn't want to do the same thing that the Clintons were doing.
[3:39:14.680 --> 3:39:31.680]  But yesterday, he sent a delegation that had in it Thomas Shannon, Peter Maureen, Kenneth Merton, and then the only Trump person was Omarosa Manigault, a former-
[3:39:31.680 --> 3:39:37.680]  If I'm not wrong, Zill, if I'm not wrong, all those people are Obama State Department alum, are they not?
[3:39:37.680 --> 3:39:58.680]  You are not wrong. And I can't tell your viewers how hurtful that was to have Obama back into Haiti, Clinton back into Haiti in our faces after, I mean, we had people literally die on the streets to stop this election.
[3:39:58.680 --> 3:40:19.680]  We stopped it in 2015. Matili was thrown out in disgrace that Matili is a puppet president that Cheryl Mills and Hillary Clinton under Obama, they rigged the election, put him in second when he was in third, to put him to go through the election and become president for five years.
[3:40:19.680 --> 3:40:35.680]  Matili ruled as a dictator for five years without parliament. So what they did was, Kenneth Merton was Obama's special Haiti coordinator. He was the ambassador during the time that they rigged the election in 2011 after the earthquake.
[3:40:35.680 --> 3:40:54.680]  And then he sent him back in 2015 so that he could put Matili's handpicked successor, a guy named Jovenel Moise, and this guy has no political experience. No one knew anything about him. In 2013, there was a money laundering case against him.
[3:40:54.680 --> 3:41:09.680]  Matili was president and Matili took that money laundering case and basically stopped it from going on. So he went into the election with this money laundering case. So this guy is not any like saint.
[3:41:09.680 --> 3:41:28.680]  He is part of the corruption in Haiti. He campaigned with Guy Philippe, who was a warlord, DEA-indicted drug smuggler. Everywhere around this man are DEA folks. For instance, there is a big billionaire.
[3:41:28.680 --> 3:41:45.680]  His name is Accra. The Haitian Aligarchy has these private ports in Haiti, and they get the drugs from the Columbia, bring it up through Bahamas, and then to our country in America to hurt our people.
[3:41:45.680 --> 3:42:02.680]  I have been trying for 20 years now to stop the Clintons and the Bushes in Haiti. I really thought we had something different with Donald Trump. But yesterday's delegation, with the same people Haitians have been fighting since 2010,
[3:42:02.680 --> 3:42:19.680]  Kenneth Merton, Maureen and Shannon came down with Amorosa. That really was a big hit for us and the folks are telling me all over, all my network. We told you so, we told you so.
[3:42:19.680 --> 3:42:21.680]  Donald Trump is not going to be any different.
[3:42:21.680 --> 3:42:38.680]  Zill, in all honesty, I'm going to give Donald Trump the benefit of the doubt. I think that Amorosa has disserved him. I don't think he understands the implications. He understands how the Clintons raped Haiti.
[3:42:38.680 --> 3:42:57.680]  I'm not sure he understands how this new government, this faux government, this puppet regime that they want the U.S. rubber stamp on, so the stealing and grafting can continue, relates to the previous government or to the operation of the Clintons that were running post-Earthquake.
[3:42:57.680 --> 3:43:14.680]  He needs to be informed. I think that she is misinforming him. Now, we know that Amorosa traveled to Haiti with Ron Daniels, the Democratic political consultant, for a conference of those supporters of the old government.
[3:43:14.680 --> 3:43:34.680]  We know that she traveled to Haiti at Daniels expense after the earthquake, so it is reasonable to understand that Daniels, who is a heavy-duty black Democratic political operative, who my friends tell me is quite capable and quite heavy-handed, is calling the shots here.
[3:43:34.680 --> 3:43:49.680]  I am talking to others to determine what the next step should be. The president needs to understand how he is being disserved and how this is inconsistent with his pledge to the Haitian people.
[3:43:49.680 --> 3:44:05.680]  The Secretary of State also needs to be alerted. In fairness to him, he's been in the office for days. He's trying to get a staff. He's got shooting wars to deal with before he can deal with the plight of the Haitian people.
[3:44:05.680 --> 3:44:19.680]  But I think he's a good man, and I think we have truth on our side. I would like to not underestimate the symbolic importance of this issue.
[3:44:19.680 --> 3:44:35.680]  I think that we have a historic opportunity, when I say we, I speak here as a Trump Republican, a historic opportunity to bring in people of color to support our party.
[3:44:35.680 --> 3:44:49.680]  More and more, I think African-American and black voters in this country understand that they've been used by the Democrats for their votes, and they've delivered nothing in terms of opportunity and prosperity.
[3:44:49.680 --> 3:45:09.680]  Instead, they're getting the dole, and the people I know don't want the dole. They want what all Americans want. They want a prosperous opportunity for their family, a nice home, a safe home, good schools, good job opportunities for when their kids get out of school.
[3:45:09.680 --> 3:45:19.680]  It's a historic time because Donald Trump could rebuild the inner cities, could bring prosperity to the ghetto, and we could have a historic realignment.
[3:45:19.680 --> 3:45:36.680]  But this, this action in Haiti is a blot against that. Any reasonable person of color in this country who knows the facts about Haiti cannot support what is being done in the president's name.
[3:45:36.680 --> 3:45:52.680]  I think we have a long section in my book, the making of the president, focuses on the opportunity. But I would ask you, Zill, don't give up on the president yet. I'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt.
[3:45:52.680 --> 3:46:07.680]  Well, believe me, we don't want to give up. And we have no choice. We don't have any choice. People are dying in Haiti. People have cholera. There's child trafficking, organ trafficking.
[3:46:07.680 --> 3:46:26.680]  This is what Amorosa and Ron Daniels went down to Haiti right yesterday to validate. Listen, right? This is the joke in Haiti right now. If you go into the Haitian Parliament and you want to clear it in five minutes, just say, here comes the DEA.
[3:46:26.680 --> 3:46:46.680]  That's how bad the corruption is of the people that they put in parliament. Okay. And this is not my people. I want everyone to know Haitians are not corrupt. These politicians were handpicked by Kenneth Merton, Peter Maureen, and the Haitian oligarchy because they have things on them.
[3:46:46.680 --> 3:47:01.680]  And this is how they work by blackmailing the put in people who are corrupted and you blackmail them to give you a port, to give you a gold license, to give you the digital monopoly for the cell phone, to turn their their eyes away from the fact that you're taking
[3:47:01.680 --> 3:47:17.680]  children out of Haiti and you win trucks and you win planes. We asked Donald Trump, frankly, like I said, you know, I was as skeptical as everyone else doing this whole entire election.
[3:47:17.680 --> 3:47:37.680]  We don't deal with evil and Americans tend to deal with two evils. But when Donald Trump and on September 16, 2016 went to little Haiti, and when he went to the South Carolina camp campaigning and he said, I mean, he was the first one to say it, because we had been trying to get
[3:47:37.680 --> 3:47:54.680]  Bernie to say something about Haiti and about what the clenches were doing to Haiti. Nothing came out of the left. Absolutely. It was Donald Trump that stood up for the people of Haiti doing this past election.
[3:47:54.680 --> 3:48:12.680]  I will say it to anyone. And he made Haiti, Haiti's name, the second most repeated name in the election, doing the doing the three various final presidential debates. That was Donald Trump.
[3:48:12.680 --> 3:48:25.680]  And because of that, a lot of people came to me to talk about what was going on in Haiti, people that we had never dealt with before. A lot of white folks came to us. And they wanted a different, they have been writing to me.
[3:48:25.680 --> 3:48:32.680]  They have been saying we want something different from Haiti. We know what the Clintons have been doing. We've been studying this stuff.
[3:48:32.680 --> 3:48:53.680]  What Donald Trump did was so important to us. He went to a North Carolina campaign, and he said that the Clinton administration, excuse me, the Clinton Foundation had made money, helped their cronies while the Haitian people suffered,
[3:48:53.680 --> 3:49:09.680]  because they raised over $10 billion at the UN with Mr. Bill Clinton, and then 3.4 at USAID, and there was no real infrastructure left for Haitian, only infrastructure in the North for the extraction companies.
[3:49:09.680 --> 3:49:20.680]  So when Donald Trump said that, yes, we said to Donald Trump, we said, you know Donald Trump, here's our message. If you want to help the inner cities in America,
[3:49:20.680 --> 3:49:39.680]  the first thing you could do is get rid of the UN occupation of Haiti. That's over a billion bucks, half a billion bucks, that America is footing for these cholera-raping folks, and use that money for the inner cities.
[3:49:39.680 --> 3:49:55.680]  We don't need the UN in Haiti. That was the first thing we asked. So we want the end of the occupation. We wanted the rigged election that was actually going on at that time. We said, you know, do not put in another Clinton puppet, a puppet of the Haitian oligarchy,
[3:49:55.680 --> 3:50:14.680]  and let the only relationship we have be based on Haiti resources. We have massive oil, gold, minerals. The Haitian landmass is a billion years old. There's a lot of limestone marble. The big, best marble in the world comes out of Haiti.
[3:50:14.680 --> 3:50:30.680]  Let us look at our riches and let's check with them. I'm afraid I got to stop you there. Thank you very much for joining us. You are one tough lady, and I'm proud to be your ally in this fight, because Amarosa must go.
[3:50:30.680 --> 3:50:54.680]  And the President's doctrine on Haiti has got to be restored. Many thanks. Thank you so much for having me.

[3:53:53.680 --> 3:54:20.680]  I am officially running for president of the United States and we are going to make our country great again.
[3:54:20.680 --> 3:54:30.680]  That Donald Day Trump has been selected as the Republican Party nominee for president of the United States.
[3:54:30.680 --> 3:54:36.680]  And I promise you that I will not let you down. We will do a great job. We will do a great job.
[3:54:36.680 --> 3:54:46.680]  And I can only say that while the campaign is over, our work on this movement is now really just beginning.
[3:54:46.680 --> 3:54:54.680]  The Making of the President 2016. How Donald Trump orchestrated a revolution.
[3:54:54.680 --> 3:55:06.680]  I love that video. It's the first time I've seen it. And this is indeed the ultimate, I think, insider's take on both the big picture trends
[3:55:06.680 --> 3:55:13.680]  and the gritty details of how Donald Trump pulled off the greatest political victory in American history.
[3:55:13.680 --> 3:55:22.680]  I make the case that this was a much bigger upset than 1948 when Harry Truman beat New York Governor Thomas E. Dewey,
[3:55:22.680 --> 3:55:30.680]  although I did see the parallels between Hillary Clinton and Dewey. Cold, aloof, and lazy.
[3:55:30.680 --> 3:55:38.680]  Tom Dewey sat out the last two weeks of the 1940 election because the poll showed he was a sure winner.
[3:55:38.680 --> 3:55:47.680]  And in this race, while Donald Trump was barnstorming his way across America, hitting Democratic strongholds like Wisconsin and Michigan
[3:55:47.680 --> 3:55:55.680]  and Western Pennsylvania doing four, five, six stops a day, Hillary was in Chappaqua wearing her pajamas
[3:55:55.680 --> 3:56:01.680]  and looking at swatches of fabric for the curtains in her Oval Office.
[3:56:01.680 --> 3:56:10.680]  Now, I think this is the book. If you're a political junkie and you want to understand what happened in this country that allowed Trump to win.
[3:56:10.680 --> 3:56:20.680]  Because you see, this was the year in which the mainstream media lost their monopoly on the dissemination of political information.
[3:56:20.680 --> 3:56:32.680]  That's why the real MVPs of this election are Alex Jones and Matt Drudge and the folks at Daily Caller and Breitbart and many, many others,
[3:56:32.680 --> 3:56:41.680]  Town Hall, who are providing the American people with more investigative journalism and more facts and more truth.
[3:56:41.680 --> 3:56:53.680]  And because the majority of Americans are no longer getting their political information from a television set, but more properly from a handheld device,
[3:56:53.680 --> 3:56:58.680]  the pendulum has shifted and the mainstream media is hysterical.
[3:56:58.680 --> 3:57:04.680]  And that allowed the election of Donald Trump.
[3:57:04.680 --> 3:57:16.680]  Now, I said several weeks ago that anyone who bought this book through InfoWars store, I would happily sign.
[3:57:16.680 --> 3:57:21.680]  That pledge is still good. I know many of you are waiting.
[3:57:21.680 --> 3:57:29.680]  I've been on a rollout of the book and you can read stories about it on the Daily Caller on Breitbart
[3:57:29.680 --> 3:57:41.680]  with my great friend, Lou Rockwell, at the Daily Caller, Real Clear Politics, Politico, and U.S. News & World Report.
[3:57:41.680 --> 3:57:53.680]  I'm very proud of the coverage. I'm still waiting for my review in the New York Times review of books, but I will not hold my breath.
[3:57:53.680 --> 3:58:01.680]  So, please, I am working on the signatures. Every single one of them. I'm going to do 15,000 if I have to.
[3:58:01.680 --> 3:58:09.680]  Alex Jones has agreed to match me so you can get both our signatures on this iconic book. Please order it today.
[3:58:09.680 --> 3:58:26.680]  And thanks for coming to InfoWars. Buy it here and help the resistance.
