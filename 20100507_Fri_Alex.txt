[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:20.760]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.760 --> 00:30.920]  obviously we're going to be breaking down what happened yesterday with one of the
[00:30.920 --> 00:36.520]  biggest one-day drops in the stock market in us and world history completely
[00:36.520 --> 00:42.720]  engineered we know that it was staged we know that the official story that
[00:42.720 --> 00:48.920]  somebody had a fat finger and dumped too much proctor and gamble stock instead of
[00:48.920 --> 00:53.920]  a million it set a billion we know that's a lie because at the exact same time
[00:53.920 --> 01:00.440]  eight other major stocks plunged to almost zero and then you got to see the
[01:00.440 --> 01:06.080]  plunge protection team the president's committee I guess on open markets come
[01:06.080 --> 01:10.680]  in and drive it back up in less than 10 minutes it dropped right at a thousand
[01:10.680 --> 01:15.440]  points and was driven back up and we've confirmed the reports it's now in
[01:15.440 --> 01:18.760]  mainstream news but I heard callers to talk radio yesterday here in Austin
[01:18.760 --> 01:23.560]  saying look we all tried to go in and buy and sell and do things we were locked
[01:23.560 --> 01:30.000]  out of all of our services so probably a staged event I don't know what Bob
[01:30.000 --> 01:34.240]  Chapman who's got a lot of sources throughout government industry and
[01:34.240 --> 01:40.320]  finance and the stock market is going to say but he is joining us today in the
[01:40.320 --> 01:45.400]  third hour to break down what's happening with this and of course what's
[01:45.400 --> 01:51.040]  going on with the situation in Greece and now becoming a black hole sucking the
[01:51.040 --> 01:56.040]  rest of Europe the United States and of course many other sectors of the world
[01:56.040 --> 02:01.320]  economy into it we know this is being engineered by the IMF and World Bank and
[02:01.320 --> 02:05.960]  the private banks that control those holding companies so that is coming up
[02:05.960 --> 02:12.400]  the third hour in the second hour we have Gerald Salente on the economy on the
[02:12.400 --> 02:16.760]  stock market plunge yesterday will get his take on what really caused it I know
[02:16.760 --> 02:21.320]  he's off investigating it right now ahead of this interview also he was on
[02:21.320 --> 02:25.720]  the show two weeks ago two and a half weeks ago and said mark my words we're
[02:25.720 --> 02:31.840]  gonna have terror attacks from Pakistan in 2010 will be the summer of real terror
[02:31.840 --> 02:40.800]  and staged terror and it will be the year of riots 2010 will be the year of
[02:40.800 --> 02:47.960]  riots and terrorism and World War three and now mark Faber who's also one of the
[02:47.960 --> 02:55.560]  best analysts out there very scary record of being right he says 90% chance
[02:55.560 --> 03:00.840]  in the next 9 to 12 months that China is gonna completely go into meltdown and
[03:00.840 --> 03:05.120]  depression of course they hold the majority of US Treasury bonds I mean it
[03:05.120 --> 03:10.760]  is getting hardcore and so we'll be talking to Gerald Salente today and we'll
[03:10.760 --> 03:16.880]  also be talking to Bob Chapman who's been off for two weeks so it's the perfect
[03:16.880 --> 03:19.360]  timing to have him back now he had a couple golf tournaments he wanted to
[03:19.360 --> 03:24.360]  play in the last two Fridays so I'm glad he wasn't off for golf tournaments when
[03:24.360 --> 03:32.560]  this when this happened I tell you the other story I want to get into upset me
[03:32.560 --> 03:42.560]  last night it upset me today it's got me in a very very nasty mood it's got me in
[03:42.560 --> 03:52.480]  a very very nasty mood and that is this SWAT team video out of Missouri and so
[03:52.480 --> 03:56.160]  at the bottom of the hour in about 25 minutes we're gonna go live at prison

[04:02.000 --> 04:09.080]  would like to tune in and we'll also air the audio here at the syndicated radio
[04:09.080 --> 04:13.680]  broadcast and the reason this upsets me so bad is it kind of brought back
[04:13.680 --> 04:19.560]  flashbacks from stories countless stories I did here in Austin where the
[04:19.560 --> 04:26.400]  exact same thing is done and to watch the cops getting off on the power trip of
[04:26.400 --> 04:32.400]  evil really brought home to me how much danger this nation is in so we're gonna
[04:32.400 --> 04:43.080]  break that down coming up as well and we got a bunch of other important news but

[08:16.120 --> 08:23.600]  radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[08:46.120 --> 09:04.480]  this my friends is pure evil and we're gonna start summer casting the radio
[09:04.480 --> 09:08.680]  show today for a full three and a half hours coming up at the bottom of this
[09:08.680 --> 09:15.120]  hour I shot a special video presentation for prison planet dot TV viewers that we
[09:15.120 --> 09:19.800]  will upload to info wars.com and prison planet.com on the YouTube channel later
[09:19.800 --> 09:31.400]  today that illustrates why I am so fundamentally upset about this video but
[09:31.400 --> 09:38.520]  I'll tell you now the basic reasons I have been on access television that's
[09:38.520 --> 09:43.600]  where I started out 15 years ago in Austin and very early on families would
[09:43.600 --> 09:48.920]  call me family after family and we've done video news reports on this I know in
[09:48.920 --> 09:53.080]  our archives we have them in fact Mike Hanson's upload those to his archive if
[09:53.080 --> 09:56.600]  you can dig them out so people can see it and I would go to these little
[09:56.600 --> 10:03.760]  middle-class houses and I would see dead Labradors dead Chihuahuas dead German
[10:03.760 --> 10:08.320]  shepherds their guts their intestines blown all over the walls in one case the
[10:08.320 --> 10:13.760]  black lab was in the kitchen and it was actually chained up on its dog bed and
[10:13.760 --> 10:19.440]  because of a dog barks it's called dog killing detail it is killed and they
[10:19.440 --> 10:24.320]  rotate whoever is on dog killing detail and when they come in your house in all
[10:24.320 --> 10:28.320]  the Austin cases I saw it was for marijuana in most cases no marijuana
[10:28.320 --> 10:33.160]  was even found in one case the people didn't even smoke marijuana the others
[10:33.160 --> 10:38.160]  were all forthcoming saying big deal we shouldn't get SWAT team for this and they
[10:38.160 --> 10:47.040]  send in paramilitary thugs to shoot your dog and in one case the bullets went
[10:47.040 --> 10:51.080]  through the wall and through the baby crib and came less than a foot away from
[10:51.080 --> 10:56.120]  the year old baby's head there's all the famous cases of police throwing flash
[10:56.120 --> 11:00.960]  bangs into baby's cribs through the window and burning the baby over 95% of
[11:00.960 --> 11:04.980]  its body that was a Texas case I mean you've seen it you've read about it or
[11:04.980 --> 11:09.920]  the wrong 92 year old ladies house in Virginia and they gun her down and then
[11:09.920 --> 11:13.360]  lie and say that she pulled a gun on them and then it came out they she didn't
[11:13.360 --> 11:18.720]  or you hear about the retired insurance salesman in a wealthy area the drug
[11:18.720 --> 11:22.520]  informant says they buy cocaine there they go there they shoot the guy in
[11:22.520 --> 11:29.160]  paralyzing and you realize that the government is shipping the drugs in
[11:29.160 --> 11:32.880]  they've been caught hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times and now
[11:32.880 --> 11:37.880]  they just admit in front of the Congress yeah the CIA ships the cocaine in yeah
[11:37.880 --> 11:42.560]  our troops grow and cultivate and protect the opium and it's increased 12
[11:42.560 --> 11:47.640]  plus times the last eight years out of Afghanistan and yeah we grow it but then
[11:47.640 --> 11:52.640]  we're gonna use it as an excuse to send paramilitary men in black uniforms to
[11:52.640 --> 11:57.360]  your house and if your French bulldog jumps off your bed when men bust in and
[11:57.360 --> 12:01.760]  barks we're gonna kill it if your Welsh Corgi that was one of the dogs killed in
[12:01.760 --> 12:05.880]  this latest video if your Welsh Corgi runs around the corner jumps out of your
[12:05.880 --> 12:10.640]  bed we're gonna kill it and then you got to watch him shoving little five and
[12:10.640 --> 12:14.600]  six year old kids around and the woman crying and the man crying and then they
[12:14.600 --> 12:19.480]  found one gram of marijuana in this Missouri case one gram that's not even
[12:19.480 --> 12:25.400]  a joint not even a marijuana cigarette and they charged them the CPS is trying
[12:25.400 --> 12:29.080]  to take their kids they said it's endangerment that you had marijuana you
[12:29.080 --> 12:38.080]  cause what the police did and so we're going to take your children and we've
[12:38.080 --> 12:42.560]  caught so many police planning drugs on people who knows if they even did find
[12:42.560 --> 12:46.560]  the marijuana pipe in the marijuana I mean how many squad car videos have you
[12:46.560 --> 12:52.480]  seen where the cops frame people on their own videos and they know what
[12:52.480 --> 12:56.600]  they're doing they ship the drugs in so they have an excuse to be involved in
[12:56.600 --> 13:02.480]  our lives they ship the drugs in it's an open secret every cop you talk to knows
[13:02.480 --> 13:08.680]  the government ship in the drugs in and because it's illegal it drives the price
[13:08.680 --> 13:14.720]  way up and so it creates a corrupting influence of judges police government and
[13:14.720 --> 13:20.560]  the general public what do they say on Fox News and the New York Times and AP
[13:20.560 --> 13:25.680]  and Reuters oh we've got to help the Afghans grow the poppies because if we
[13:25.680 --> 13:31.960]  don't Al Qaeda will and they'll get the money no you de-criminalize drugs and
[13:31.960 --> 13:37.640]  then Al Qaeda as if it's not Al CIA to won't have that money that's how twisted
[13:37.640 --> 13:42.760]  this is and this is their excuse to engage in this un-American activity you
[13:42.760 --> 13:46.200]  go back 30 years ago with special weapons attack teams and they changed the
[13:46.200 --> 13:49.800]  name to special weapons and tactics more politically correct it started out for
[13:49.800 --> 13:53.880]  bank robberies for hostage situations and then oh well there's a bigger
[13:53.880 --> 13:57.680]  statistical chance in drug raids that is going to be dangerous for officers and
[13:57.680 --> 14:02.560]  now they have officers just in regular pot raids and checkpoints on the highway
[14:02.560 --> 14:06.360]  and you watch the video and they're pointing their machine guns at the
[14:06.360 --> 14:11.920]  little kid and the woman is there and and and the guy starts crying when he
[14:11.920 --> 14:16.920]  learns they've killed his dogs and you see the cops on these power trips just
[14:16.920 --> 14:24.520]  with with looks of enjoyment on their faces it tears my soul out meanwhile
[14:24.520 --> 14:29.800]  police their lives are endangered with these type of tactics their lives are
[14:29.800 --> 14:33.800]  endangered out raiding people for drugs but that's the family business that's
[14:33.800 --> 14:37.800]  the government family business that's their excuse to put tens of millions of
[14:37.800 --> 14:41.480]  people in the criminal justice system the most imprisoned country on earth
[14:41.480 --> 14:45.640]  that's their excuse that's the criminal element the criminal element doesn't
[14:45.640 --> 14:51.040]  just ship the drugs in they use them to federalize our police and they use them
[14:51.040 --> 14:57.560]  to corrupt the police with drug seizure money and the story is up on info wars
[14:57.560 --> 15:01.320]  dot com and prison planet dot com I like the thing that reason online said
[15:01.320 --> 15:06.760]  video of SWAT raid on Missouri family in February I wrote the following about a
[15:06.760 --> 15:10.240]  drug raid in Missouri now the video has been released SWAT team breaks into home
[15:10.240 --> 15:15.000]  fire seven rounds at family dogs as seven year old looks on they found a
[15:15.000 --> 15:19.400]  small amount we now have the case it's a grandma marijuana enough for a
[15:19.400 --> 15:23.400]  misdemeanor charge the parents were then charged with child endangerment for
[15:23.400 --> 15:28.120]  smoking pot child endangerment storming a home with guns then firing bullets into
[15:28.120 --> 15:32.680]  the family pets as a child looks on equals necessary police procedures to
[15:32.680 --> 15:36.760]  ensure everyone's safety just so we're clear now there's the video which you
[15:36.760 --> 15:40.520]  can watch below it's up on info wars dot com and present planet dot com it's
[15:40.520 --> 15:45.560]  horrifying but I urge you to watch it and to send it to the drug warriors in
[15:45.560 --> 15:51.720]  your life this is the blunt end result of all of the war imagery and
[15:51.720 --> 15:55.960]  militaristic rhetoric politicians have been spewing for 30 years cop stress like
[15:55.960 --> 15:59.720]  soldiers barreling through the front doors of the middle of the night in the
[15:59.720 --> 16:03.240]  middle class family slaughtering the family pets filling the house with
[16:03.240 --> 16:06.920]  bullets in the presence of children then having the audacity to charge the
[16:06.920 --> 16:12.440]  parents with endangering their own children there are 100 to 150 of these
[16:12.440 --> 16:16.680]  raids every day in america the vast vast majority like this one to serve a
[16:16.680 --> 16:22.360]  warrant for a consensual crime every week in austin they kill dogs just where i
[16:22.360 --> 16:28.760]  live your dog barks your dog dies and many times there's not even marijuana in
[16:28.760 --> 16:32.920]  the house or it's the wrong address and can you imagine that that this can
[16:32.920 --> 16:38.040]  happen to anyone and you watch these cops when the guys crying and they are
[16:38.040 --> 16:43.080]  getting off on it stomping around you are not real men you are cowards you are
[16:43.080 --> 16:47.320]  errand boys for the narcotics trafficking cia and the big banks that
[16:47.320 --> 16:55.720]  launder the money period period period and it's got to end it's got to end
[16:55.720 --> 17:04.760]  we've got to decriminalize all drugs now it is so elementary
[17:06.760 --> 17:11.720]  mafia interest lobbied and used well-meaning christians to support it
[17:11.720 --> 17:17.480]  to outlaw alcohol alcoholism more than tripled the profits more than tripled
[17:17.480 --> 17:21.000]  the police forces that had already been paid off to protect
[17:21.000 --> 17:25.800]  the whorehouses and gambling were then fully bought off and after 10 years of
[17:25.800 --> 17:29.560]  prohibition in the country just in an absolute drug war like
[17:29.560 --> 17:33.640]  mexico almost collapsing in many areas because it funded all other levels of
[17:33.640 --> 17:38.120]  crime they were forced to decriminalize alcohol
[17:38.120 --> 17:42.200]  now oh yeah it was like having cocaine to have a beer
[17:42.200 --> 17:49.000]  now the same interest when they lost prohibition lobbied to make drug store
[17:49.000 --> 17:52.040]  drugs illegal you could buy cocaine heroin opium
[17:52.040 --> 17:58.200]  anything marijuana you name it it was called basically stomachache hemp was
[17:58.200 --> 18:02.280]  one of the brand names but the point is you could buy it anywhere
[18:02.280 --> 18:07.000]  little newspaper stands sold it and less people used it than use it today
[18:07.000 --> 18:10.120]  you make it illegal it drives up the price it makes it risque
[18:10.120 --> 18:14.280]  it makes it avant-garde it makes young people get involved it creates a market
[18:14.280 --> 18:18.520]  to push it and to sell it and for people to rob your house to get money
[18:18.520 --> 18:22.680]  to fund it all of the horrors of the drug war and the drug culture
[18:22.680 --> 18:26.600]  and all the scum that are involved in it and all of the illegals pouring across

[25:36.680 --> 25:39.880]  being trained with the police and they've seen what i've seen they say the
[25:39.880 --> 25:43.320]  police are even worse than the military who's been in iraq and afghanistan
[25:43.320 --> 25:47.240]  they just talk about the public is scum and how they frame the public
[25:47.240 --> 25:51.640]  and how much fun it is and how they love it and how they enjoy it and all the
[25:51.640 --> 25:55.160]  big police departments all over the country are constantly being caught
[25:55.160 --> 25:58.600]  planning drugs on people to take their cars and the police get part of the
[25:58.600 --> 26:00.600]  money and the police are stealing the money
[26:00.600 --> 26:04.040]  out of the drug lockups and out of the money lockups when they raid drug
[26:04.040 --> 26:06.840]  dealers they're keeping most the money for themselves and
[26:06.840 --> 26:10.040]  in all these big cities and small towns cops are living in million-dollar
[26:10.040 --> 26:13.400]  houses and driving brand new corvettes and nobody asks how they've got the
[26:13.400 --> 26:16.280]  money it's a mafia ladies and gentlemen
[26:16.280 --> 26:21.640]  it's a mafia period and the only way you shut down the mafia in mexico
[26:21.640 --> 26:24.120]  that's taken the country over is you decriminalize
[26:24.120 --> 26:28.280]  then all their money's gone but in mexico politicians that have called for
[26:28.280 --> 26:32.360]  decriminalizing drugs have been murdered and you better believe that it
[26:32.360 --> 26:35.640]  starts gaining steam steam here they'll murder you as well
[26:35.640 --> 26:39.000]  you're not about to get in the way of their hundreds of billions a year
[26:39.000 --> 26:42.760]  in pure profit they're making and how they get to raid all the slaves
[26:42.760 --> 26:45.960]  and how they get to pack the prisons full of people and how they get to run
[26:45.960 --> 26:48.520]  checkpoints you're not about to get in the way
[26:48.520 --> 26:52.040]  of these boys because they're the biggest street gang in america
[26:52.040 --> 26:55.400]  and they know full well the cia brings the goodies in
[26:55.400 --> 26:59.320]  the slaves are dumb enough to pick it up and as soon as they pick it up
[26:59.320 --> 27:03.240]  that gives them fair game to open up on everybody
[27:03.240 --> 27:07.960]  and that's what this is about period and so i'm in there during the break
[27:07.960 --> 27:10.920]  watching the video of labrador retrievers jumping out with their
[27:10.920 --> 27:15.560]  tails wagging out of cars and those cops just gun them down
[27:15.560 --> 27:19.560]  so you understand when the police raid you looking for drugs
[27:19.560 --> 27:22.680]  half the time you don't even have drugs and it's the wrong house
[27:22.680 --> 27:26.120]  you just remember every one of your dogs is dead
[27:26.120 --> 27:29.560]  let's just remember one of your kids is asleep and
[27:29.560 --> 27:33.720]  makes a wrong move they're dead you just remember that and if a SWAT team shoots
[27:33.720 --> 27:36.840]  their own officer in the back like they've done all over the
[27:36.840 --> 27:40.680]  country and been caught countless times they're going to frame you for killing
[27:40.680 --> 27:43.560]  their own officer because you're a scum american
[27:43.560 --> 27:47.400]  you're a piece of filth who exists for one reason to work in a prison
[27:47.400 --> 27:51.880]  and to pay taxes you exist for one reason and that's to serve government in the

[28:12.600 --> 28:16.440]  that's coming in here to take the pension funds and everything else
[28:16.440 --> 28:20.280]  they're going to take everything they want because they got the guns
[28:20.280 --> 28:24.120]  and they just can't wait and they've been taught that authority is god
[28:24.120 --> 28:27.160]  and it doesn't matter how unconstitutional it is they're going to
[28:27.160 --> 28:31.240]  do what they want to do when they want to do it

[33:22.120 --> 33:25.320]  in the stock market which even cnbc experts are saying
[33:25.320 --> 33:29.720]  had to be contrived had to be manipulated had to be some type of insider
[33:29.720 --> 33:32.520]  trading and manipulation not somebody with fat fingers
[33:32.520 --> 33:37.880]  then bob chap in the hour after that joins us on the same important subject
[33:37.880 --> 33:41.560]  now we're going live with a video at info wars
[33:41.560 --> 33:46.440]  dot com in the next 30 minutes with an article that erin dykes has written
[33:46.440 --> 33:52.440]  and this video is so important this video is so key
[33:52.440 --> 33:56.120]  that you're about to see and it deals with
[33:56.120 --> 34:02.200]  this missouri case of a swat team for a gram of marijuana that's less than a
[34:02.200 --> 34:07.240]  thimble less than a marijuana cigarette swat teaming a middle-class home
[34:07.240 --> 34:11.400]  killing a corgi and a bulldog and pointing machine guns at the seven-year-old
[34:11.400 --> 34:15.080]  kid and bossing everybody around and then charging them with child
[34:15.080 --> 34:18.360]  endangerment and sicken the cps on them to try to take their
[34:18.360 --> 34:23.240]  children kidnap their children because they had marijuana
[34:23.240 --> 34:27.480]  and in this video i integrate the fact that the u.s government can't hide it
[34:27.480 --> 34:31.320]  anymore that they grow the opium in afghanistan
[34:31.320 --> 34:34.600]  it was declassified in vietnam thousands of tons of
[34:34.600 --> 34:40.120]  heroin were shipped out opium and heroin it was declassified in 96 the cia
[34:40.120 --> 34:43.880]  ran the crack cocaine epidemic and even gave the dealers
[34:43.880 --> 34:49.080]  the recipe to make crack that's on record the majority of narcotics is
[34:49.080 --> 34:53.560]  shipped into the united states now they raid people that smoke marijuana and
[34:53.560 --> 34:56.520]  they call it a narcotic more than they do people using hard
[34:56.520 --> 35:00.680]  drugs the government brings in 86 of americans who use illegal drugs
[35:00.680 --> 35:04.920]  only use marijuana over 80 of americans have used
[35:04.920 --> 35:08.760]  marijuana so 80 plus percent of you are in danger
[35:08.760 --> 35:11.560]  and the rest of you are in danger because they constantly raid the wrong
[35:11.560 --> 35:15.400]  house or an informant lies think about it
[35:15.400 --> 35:19.080]  is the evil of paramilitary cops coming in your house
[35:19.080 --> 35:22.680]  at midnight shooting your dogs terrorizing your children
[35:22.680 --> 35:26.040]  worth it and then having cps try to take their children
[35:26.040 --> 35:29.880]  for a gram of marijuana is this freedom
[35:29.880 --> 35:33.240]  while the government because they can't hide it anymore says well
[35:33.240 --> 35:37.560]  to be patriotic we grow the opium we help the villages
[35:37.560 --> 35:40.520]  now again this has come out for years in foreign media
[35:40.520 --> 35:43.800]  now it's mainstream news and Reuters ap you name it
[35:43.800 --> 35:48.200]  but they say this is what we have to do because if we don't ship the drugs out
[35:48.200 --> 35:51.640]  al-qaeda will and they'll get the money
[35:51.640 --> 35:54.360]  and there's no investigation then of who's getting the money or where it's
[35:54.360 --> 35:56.920]  being shipped they just say it's for al-qaeda
[35:56.920 --> 36:00.280]  we're going to naked body scan you and your family to fight al-qaeda
[36:00.280 --> 36:03.320]  we're going to grow the opium to fight al-qaeda we're going to secretly arrest
[36:03.320 --> 36:07.720]  citizens and strip you your rights to fight al-qaeda
[36:07.720 --> 36:10.760]  and they've grown this giant paramilitary force that trains with the
[36:10.760 --> 36:14.360]  military under the drug war now they're saying it's for the tea parties
[36:14.360 --> 36:18.040]  gun owners conservatives libertarians they're now going to rotate this system
[36:18.040 --> 36:21.000]  over and expand it against the general public
[36:21.000 --> 36:24.840]  and you watch these cops their body language they're clearly enjoying it the
[36:24.840 --> 36:29.400]  more the father cries the bigger a power trip they get on
[36:29.400 --> 36:33.080]  and if these cops don't know that most drugs are shipped in by the government
[36:33.080 --> 36:36.760]  and if they don't know that when drugs were legal 80 years ago there was much
[36:36.760 --> 36:40.920]  less drug abuse in this country if they don't know that prohibition of alcohol
[36:40.920 --> 36:43.560]  radically expanded the amount of crime in the country
[36:43.560 --> 36:46.600]  and corrupted police and that when they didn't have prohibition anymore
[36:46.600 --> 36:50.120]  they created drug prohibition to keep their business going and it was the
[36:50.120 --> 36:53.800]  government and government controlled groups that actually shipped the drugs
[36:53.800 --> 36:58.840]  in and started the drug culture in america
[36:58.840 --> 37:03.160]  this is a fact ladies and gentlemen so they shipped the drugs in as a pretext
[37:03.160 --> 37:06.040]  to put you in their private prisons that are predominantly owned by the big
[37:06.040 --> 37:09.560]  money laundering banks the drug dealers bring the drugs in
[37:09.560 --> 37:13.880]  then they put you in their private prisons making 25 cents an hour on average
[37:13.880 --> 37:17.240]  displacing everybody else's jobs and lowering the wages
[37:17.240 --> 37:22.360]  even more than the illegal aliens do so it's all about destroying the economy
[37:22.360 --> 37:26.040]  to consolidate it and that's why we're in afghanistan
[37:26.040 --> 37:30.360]  500 billion a year in opium it was less than 50 billion a year in opium coming
[37:30.360 --> 37:34.840]  out pre 9 11 okay so that's what's happening we
[37:34.840 --> 37:40.280]  were sent to afghanistan number one to take control of the opium number two
[37:40.280 --> 37:43.240]  for the unical oil pipeline and natural gas pipelines
[37:43.240 --> 37:47.800]  number three for weapon sales number four to encircle uh and and put a buffer
[37:47.800 --> 37:52.040]  between the stands north of there in russia and
[37:52.040 --> 37:54.680]  china and this is all strategically laid out
[37:54.680 --> 37:58.440]  it is a fact that the anglo-american establishment are the biggest narcotics
[37:58.440 --> 38:01.400]  traffickers in the world the british east india company had a worldwide
[38:01.400 --> 38:05.480]  monopoly on opium they set up a monopoly organization at
[38:05.480 --> 38:09.000]  yale in 1832 known as skull and bones that's
[38:09.000 --> 38:13.160]  mainline history that skull and bones was a narcotics
[38:13.160 --> 38:17.080]  trafficking gang but opium was legal then
[38:17.080 --> 38:21.880]  they would hire their own ships to hunt down as pirates and kill anybody
[38:21.880 --> 38:26.120]  trying to ship in opium so see they always had trouble having a monopoly just
[38:26.120 --> 38:29.480]  like the beers with the diamonds and how they'll hunt you down and use
[38:29.480 --> 38:33.400]  mercenaries if if you mine diamonds that that you don't sell to them
[38:33.400 --> 38:37.720]  that's all this is but but again it's gone too far
[38:37.720 --> 38:43.720]  this gives their paramilitary police who are now coming for political dissidents
[38:43.720 --> 38:47.720]  literal death squads these are death squads in the making in the training
[38:47.720 --> 38:51.080]  and you see their cold-bloodedness how dehumanized
[38:51.080 --> 38:54.840]  the american people are where they kill your dogs and we've seen the cnn video
[38:54.840 --> 38:59.240]  let's play the cnn video first the cnn video and there's countless videos
[38:59.240 --> 39:06.120]  of a dog gets out runs up labrador with its tail wagon cops shotgun in the face
[39:06.120 --> 39:09.320]  i have done many tv programs here locally
[39:09.320 --> 39:12.360]  in austin where i would go to homes and see a lab a black lab
[39:12.360 --> 39:15.720]  with bullets its guts its brains everywhere bullets that went through the
[39:15.720 --> 39:19.880]  wall into the baby's crib no marijuana was found
[39:19.880 --> 39:23.480]  and the cops don't apologize they you know they throw flashbanks in the baby's
[39:23.480 --> 39:29.400]  cribs that happened in midland uh another case in midland a few years ago
[39:29.400 --> 39:33.160]  the cops shot their own officer in the back and then framed the guy
[39:33.160 --> 39:39.160]  in the house who didn't even have guns he had a toy black powder gun that he'd
[39:39.160 --> 39:42.360]  gotten when he was a kid they tried to say that was the gun and then a swat
[39:42.360 --> 39:45.880]  team officer told the truth and said no we shot our own officer in the back
[39:45.880 --> 39:49.960]  it's a 223 round and then they released the audio tapes for the cops
[39:49.960 --> 39:54.200]  were on the tape admitting they'd done it you are not human to them
[39:54.200 --> 39:58.360]  you don't exist your dog doesn't exist your child crying
[39:58.360 --> 40:02.680]  seeing the dead dog doesn't exist they are getting off on this and all cops
[40:02.680 --> 40:06.360]  don't have this mentality but the system is trying to train them
[40:06.360 --> 40:10.680]  and and literally possess them with this authoritarian
[40:10.680 --> 40:14.600]  thug nightmare mentality so let's play that clip of the dog being
[40:14.600 --> 40:20.600]  shot for wagging its tail
[41:14.600 --> 41:21.880]  all right now there are so many of these clips that's not the one i was even
[41:21.880 --> 41:25.560]  looking for there's another clip where it's broad daylight the lab runs right
[41:25.560 --> 41:29.800]  up with its tail wagon and they just shotgun it right in the face
[41:29.800 --> 41:34.600]  but it's video after video after video of things like this in the name
[41:34.600 --> 41:39.880]  of stopping drugs that the government has been caught over and over again
[41:39.880 --> 41:42.040]  shipping in and now they're not even caught
[41:42.040 --> 41:44.760]  they think you're so stupid and so weak-minded
[41:44.760 --> 41:48.760]  they just come right out and say you know what
[41:48.760 --> 41:52.200]  we are actually helping them grow it let's go ahead and go to this video that
[41:52.200 --> 41:55.800]  i just put together with erin dykes last night and erin did a great job
[41:55.800 --> 41:59.640]  compiling this where i expose the hypocrisy this video is going up on
[41:59.640 --> 42:03.560]  prisonplanet.com and info wars.com the next hour we need this video to go
[42:03.560 --> 42:07.080]  mega viral here it is
[42:07.080 --> 42:12.360]  the video you're about to see is standard operating procedure and happens
[42:12.360 --> 42:15.480]  thousands of times per week in the united states
[42:15.480 --> 42:19.480]  this was columbia missouri swat team goes in
[42:19.480 --> 42:22.840]  the people open the front door they go in they have a welch corgi
[42:22.840 --> 42:26.520]  and a bulldog the dogs are barking at them and they shoot them both and kill
[42:26.520 --> 42:29.080]  them then you see the little children you see the
[42:29.080 --> 42:32.200]  father crying when he finds out his dogs are dead
[42:32.200 --> 42:36.360]  and you look at the looks on the police officer's face when he's crying
[42:36.360 --> 42:40.520]  and they've got this look of power tripping
[42:40.520 --> 42:44.520]  enjoyment and they won't ever respond to him they won't ever talk to him when he
[42:44.520 --> 42:48.200]  asks questions so he doesn't respond to them after
[42:48.200 --> 42:53.480]  that when they ask him questions and they reported that they found
[42:53.480 --> 42:58.280]  one gram of marijuana and his marijuana pipe ladies and gentlemen
[42:58.280 --> 43:03.080]  let me explain something here the drug war was initiated
[43:03.080 --> 43:06.760]  after prohibition the 1930s the trafficking interest controlled by
[43:06.760 --> 43:09.880]  yell university skull and bones and others this is all on record
[43:09.880 --> 43:12.760]  traveled around the country and got the states and the federal government to
[43:12.760 --> 43:16.680]  pass laws against opium heroin cocaine things
[43:16.680 --> 43:20.360]  like that that were sold at convenience stores it was sold at every major
[43:20.360 --> 43:23.080]  little pharmacy and in the old days convenience stores were mainly
[43:23.080 --> 43:26.760]  pharmacies they had newspapers and drugs and things less people were using
[43:26.760 --> 43:31.480]  marijuana cocaine heroin when they were legal once they made them illegal
[43:31.480 --> 43:35.400]  the price went way up and the reason i raised this issue is
[43:35.400 --> 43:39.320]  no one is safe the police can bust in your door
[43:39.320 --> 43:43.080]  because some drug addict informant says that they saw marijuana there
[43:43.080 --> 43:47.480]  and i thought about my french bulldog what happens with my 35 pound dog and
[43:47.480 --> 43:50.360]  my chihuahua if a swat team ever comes to my house and i don't even smoke
[43:50.360 --> 43:54.040]  marijuana i do drink some and my dogs will bark they will
[43:54.040 --> 43:57.000]  run out they will jump out of the bed they sleep with us and the police will
[43:57.000 --> 43:59.960]  kill them years ago on my local tv show we did
[43:59.960 --> 44:04.120]  episode after episode of locals who were swat teams where drugs weren't even
[44:04.120 --> 44:06.840]  found and they would come in and kill a lab
[44:06.840 --> 44:10.280]  that was even chained up in the kitchen and we went and showed photos of it
[44:10.280 --> 44:13.480]  with his brains blown out and its intestines everywhere and the cops were
[44:13.480 --> 44:16.520]  laughing in that case and they fired bullets through the wall
[44:16.520 --> 44:20.600]  that went into the baby crib in one case and the issue is these police officers
[44:20.600 --> 44:25.160]  have lost their souls they're getting off on this does that mean all police
[44:25.160 --> 44:30.600]  are getting off on it no but the issue is the phony drug war gives the pentagon
[44:30.600 --> 44:33.000]  that's involved in it and the militarized police
[44:33.000 --> 44:36.600]  an excuse to be involved in our daily lives to knock down our doors
[44:36.600 --> 44:39.880]  to give them some type of fake jurisdiction so we're going to play you
[44:39.880 --> 44:43.800]  clips from this video of what they've done we'll
[44:43.800 --> 44:58.360]  post the full video shot by the police up in the corner if you want to watch it
[44:58.360 --> 45:02.760]  move move pass it
[45:07.480 --> 45:11.800]  don't move you understand put your hands behind your back do it now
[45:11.800 --> 45:15.720]  put your back what is happening search warrant
[45:15.720 --> 45:20.600]  narcotics search warrant don't move search turn right
[45:30.200 --> 45:34.600]  see what's on play with you come over here see what's on play with you once we get
[45:34.600 --> 45:43.160]  down and get him in the car see pop yeah yeah the right to talk you'll
[45:43.160 --> 45:48.040]  worry about why you're being questioned do you understand
[45:48.040 --> 45:51.800]  we'll take that as a yes you are allowed to take as a matter of fact that's fine
[45:51.800 --> 45:55.640]  okay come on i'm doing this wrong but this is why i'm doing this video this is
[45:55.640 --> 46:00.200]  why i'm so outraged this is the key it has come out in the last eight years
[46:00.200 --> 46:03.800]  that the Taliban had cut off almost all opium production in Afghanistan previously
[46:03.800 --> 46:07.000]  the main site of opium that then produces heroin
[46:07.000 --> 46:10.600]  and that the u.s government went in and started helping the afghans grow the
[46:10.600 --> 46:13.240]  opium again and of course the cia got caught in
[46:13.240 --> 46:16.200]  vietnam on record shipping opium out they were caught
[46:16.200 --> 46:20.760]  1996 even the cia inspector general admitted that most the cocaine
[46:20.760 --> 46:25.240]  for the crack cocaine epidemic was shipped in and now in afghanistan because
[46:25.240 --> 46:28.200]  pat tilman wrote letters home before they killed him saying look we're growing
[46:28.200 --> 46:31.560]  the opium this is wrong i'm against this war it's a fraud
[46:31.560 --> 46:34.760]  now because all that info's come out and the troops are there being forced to
[46:34.760 --> 46:38.040]  help grow the opium they've come out in the new york times and said yeah
[46:38.040 --> 46:41.720]  mohammed karzai's brother the president of afghanistan's the biggest drug dealer
[46:41.720 --> 46:45.160]  yeah we're letting them grow the opium yeah we're helping them we've got to do
[46:45.160 --> 46:49.960]  this or al qaeda will get the money no you decriminalize it and then al qaeda the
[46:49.960 --> 46:53.480]  cia they won't have the profit because it's
[46:53.480 --> 46:56.600]  illegal anymore and it won't have the huge profits involved in it with the
[46:56.600 --> 47:00.680]  black market but here's the deal the government ships most the cocaine in
[47:00.680 --> 47:03.640]  the only people they buster those that aren't paying their cut
[47:03.640 --> 47:07.160]  okay the government ships in almost all the heroin it's more than up
[47:07.160 --> 47:11.480]  12 times what it was eight and a half years ago when we invented afghanistan
[47:11.480 --> 47:16.360]  record numbers over 90 percent of global opium is coming out of afghanistan and
[47:16.360 --> 47:20.040]  they have herald a reverie there with the marine corps commander going i don't
[47:20.040 --> 47:22.200]  like it but we've got to help them grow it and
[47:22.200 --> 47:26.040]  you know we're here letting them do it the hard part now is governing this
[47:26.040 --> 47:28.760]  province and province as you suggest that it's become
[47:28.760 --> 47:33.640]  addicted to opium in many many ways that is the principal crop that is being
[47:33.640 --> 47:37.640]  grown here the taliban lend the farmers the money
[47:37.640 --> 47:41.240]  they are indebted to the taliban they have to grow the opium
[47:41.240 --> 47:45.720]  now the marines in their success are in a sense a victim of their success
[47:45.720 --> 47:50.280]  because now the population is uh you know if they have these opium fields
[47:50.280 --> 47:53.560]  and we are tolerating it we are tolerating the cultivation
[47:53.560 --> 47:57.320]  of the opium because we know that if we were to destroy it now
[47:57.320 --> 48:00.280]  the population would turn against the marines and it would be a real
[48:00.280 --> 48:04.280]  security risk that you're watching as this opium is being grown i know
[48:04.280 --> 48:08.440]  it grinds at your gut how do you deal with it what are you doing about it
[48:08.440 --> 48:11.560]  well frankly this is part of their culture so
[48:11.560 --> 48:15.640]  while it might grind in my gut it's what they do i fault the politicians for
[48:15.640 --> 48:19.640]  putting the marines in this position you know where we can eradicate these
[48:19.640 --> 48:23.400]  these crops for security reasons and that's the point
[48:23.400 --> 48:27.560]  they ship it in to have an excuse to bust down your door and build giant
[48:27.560 --> 48:30.680]  prisons we have the biggest prison population in the world
[48:30.680 --> 48:33.720]  and no one is safe i've seen countless reports of
[48:33.720 --> 48:38.280]  you know retired cpa's and people when the swat team raids the wrong house and
[48:38.280 --> 48:41.640]  kills them or old ladies 90 something years old
[48:41.640 --> 48:45.240]  and they shoot them and kill them and then you see the cops laughing about it
[48:45.240 --> 48:49.480]  you see them enjoying it you see them on this big power trip
[48:49.480 --> 48:53.000]  and you also have the police raiding real drug dealers and keeping the money
[48:53.000 --> 48:56.520]  keeping the drugs seizing their assets taking cash out of people's
[48:56.520 --> 48:59.720]  wallets on the highway letting illegal aliens go that have been caught with
[48:59.720 --> 49:03.080]  105 thousand dollars of drugs just last week in Tennessee
[49:03.080 --> 49:07.720]  the government runs the narcotics business and they then put you in their
[49:07.720 --> 49:12.200]  private prisons making license plates and
[49:12.200 --> 49:15.880]  making furniture to then compete with everybody else it's on the outside
[49:15.880 --> 49:19.640]  so the prisoners are making 25 cents an hour that drives down wages just like
[49:19.640 --> 49:23.160]  the illegal aliens do mexico is collapsing because of the phony drug
[49:23.160 --> 49:25.800]  war the united states is going to collapse and
[49:25.800 --> 49:30.360]  this is pure nazi germany to have men come in your house and kill your dogs
[49:30.360 --> 49:34.120]  because they bark at them every single day in this country
[49:34.120 --> 49:37.800]  and then just sit there smugly enjoying the power trip
[49:37.800 --> 49:41.960]  from what they've done think about it the troops are over in afghanistan
[49:41.960 --> 49:44.600]  growing the opium they're going to come back most of them are going to be in
[49:44.600 --> 49:47.320]  swat team people and cops and then they're going to raid your
[49:47.320 --> 49:50.680]  house for a gram of marijuana you think about that
[49:50.680 --> 49:54.280]  80 plus percent of the american people smoke marijuana or have smoked it most
[49:54.280 --> 49:57.080]  cops have smoked it but they don't care they're going to come in your house
[49:57.080 --> 50:00.280]  kill your dogs in front of your we're going to play part two of this when we
[50:00.280 --> 50:03.400]  come back in the next segment and gerald salentes joining us via video skype
[50:03.400 --> 50:06.680]  for the radio and prison planet dot tv viewers
[50:06.680 --> 50:10.600]  but this is their excuse this is the pentagon and the military and the
[50:10.600 --> 50:15.560]  government's excuse to make you the enemy anybody could have drugs
[50:15.560 --> 50:19.880]  anybody could be a terrorist anybody could be a child molester anybody
[50:19.880 --> 50:23.080]  except when you look at it the government's full of the child molesters
[50:23.080 --> 50:28.600]  it's full of the drug dealers it's full of the people staging the terror attacks
[50:28.600 --> 50:31.960]  and we must get the word out that the government is illegitimate and is
[50:31.960 --> 50:35.720]  dealing almost all the major drugs they ship them in
[50:35.720 --> 50:39.800]  then at the street level they put you in prison or they kill your dog or they
[50:39.800 --> 50:43.400]  come to your house and it's not enough that they came and killed their dogs
[50:43.400 --> 50:49.000]  for a gram of marijuana no now the cps is in the process of taking
[50:49.000 --> 50:53.640]  these people's children right now in missouri and they do 150 of these raids
[50:53.640 --> 50:56.360]  every day i was just reading articles where they killed

[54:10.920 --> 54:14.920]  to have jurisdiction in our lives it's not enough to keep it illegal
[54:14.920 --> 54:19.800]  and ship the drugs in so they get higher profits by keeping it illegal
[54:19.800 --> 54:24.040]  they also want to tax you by taking you to prison by making you build widgets

[54:56.280 --> 55:00.520]  erin dykes to all write articles about this hypocrisy from their own

[55:12.920 --> 55:16.120]  they will kill your dogs and they think it's funny
[55:16.120 --> 55:19.800]  okay this is total evil remember they ship
[55:19.800 --> 55:23.000]  the drugs in and then they do this here it is
[55:23.000 --> 55:26.040]  think about it the troops are over in afghanistan growing the opium they're
[55:26.040 --> 55:29.320]  going to come back most of them are going to be in SWAT team people in cops
[55:29.320 --> 55:32.840]  and then they're going to raid your house for a gram of marijuana you think
[55:32.840 --> 55:35.480]  about that 80 plus percent of the american people
[55:35.480 --> 55:39.080]  smoke marijuana or have smoked it most cops have smoked it but they don't care
[55:39.080 --> 55:42.280]  they're going to come in your house kill your dogs in front of your little kids
[55:42.280 --> 55:46.200]  they're going to drag you off to jail for a gram of marijuana that's less than a
[55:46.200 --> 55:49.480]  joint this is completely disgusting and sickening
[55:49.480 --> 55:53.880]  so you've seen the video of the kids the dogs bleeding to death in pain
[55:53.880 --> 55:57.640]  you've seen the cops with their smug looks of enjoyment whenever the father
[55:57.640 --> 56:01.320]  is crying and you've seen the newscast where
[56:01.320 --> 56:04.840]  fox news is explaining to you we've got to help grow the opium
[56:04.840 --> 56:08.760]  we've got to let them do this to fight al-qaeda it is a sickening fraud
[56:08.760 --> 56:11.880]  and look they were denying this years ago but now because it's so out in the
[56:11.880 --> 56:14.360]  open and the troops are right in home and speaking out
[56:14.360 --> 56:17.240]  about why are we growing the opium they're just hiding it in plain view
[56:17.240 --> 56:20.280]  we help grow the opium we let them ship it out
[56:20.280 --> 56:23.320]  and then if we catch you with it we're going to kill your dogs and come in your
[56:23.320 --> 56:25.000]  house and if we catch him with marijuana we're
[56:25.000 --> 56:28.360]  going to do it because we're fighting drugs because drugs are bad
[56:28.360 --> 56:32.200]  it's all these fake moral people in america who are supporting the drug war
[56:32.200 --> 56:35.560]  like a bunch of ignoramuses who are allowing this giant police state to
[56:35.560 --> 56:39.080]  grow up around them that is going to enslave them and their families
[56:39.080 --> 56:43.400]  understand the troops throwing puppies off clips the troops shooting children
[56:43.400 --> 56:46.600]  the troops torturing people they're having their minds warped and they're
[56:46.600 --> 56:50.280]  coming back to become cops who have that hunger to see that
[56:50.280 --> 56:54.680]  pain and to have that domination and to have that control going after drugs
[56:54.680 --> 56:57.720]  that were shipped in by the government but why do they hate marijuana so much
[56:57.720 --> 57:00.680]  the government doesn't control marijuana it can be grown anywhere
[57:00.680 --> 57:03.960]  and that's why they're doing it that's why they're coming against the american
[57:03.960 --> 57:06.680]  people this isn't america this isn't freedom
[57:06.680 --> 57:11.560]  it is a fraud remember that the government openly ships the drugs in now
[57:11.560 --> 57:15.160]  they hide it in plain view and admit they're doing it and they think you're
[57:15.160 --> 57:18.920]  too stupid to put two and two together in the new york times and ap and
[57:18.920 --> 57:22.200]  everywhere the russians said let us go in and spray the opium
[57:22.200 --> 57:27.000]  we're losing 30 000 russians a year from heroin overdoses and nato said no
[57:27.000 --> 57:30.200]  we're not going to allow eradication u.s troops are now
[57:30.200 --> 57:33.960]  basically farmers they're helping grow the opium
[57:33.960 --> 57:37.000]  protecting it and then it's shipped out of the country and it's come out that a
[57:37.000 --> 57:40.200]  lot of the big defense contractors and private mercenary groups
[57:40.200 --> 57:43.640]  are busy flying the drugs out and they're also using rendition cia
[57:43.640 --> 57:47.320]  aircraft for kidnapped people in the u.s and worldwide they grab
[57:47.320 --> 57:50.680]  to also fly the drugs in and out that's like a few years ago roiders reported
[57:50.680 --> 57:54.200]  that a cia aircraft filled with pure cocaine coming from the source
[57:54.200 --> 57:57.320]  crashed in mexico and now that's not enough this big police
[57:57.320 --> 58:00.600]  state's hungry for the american people they're trying to pass laws where no
[58:00.600 --> 58:04.600]  judge no jury no charges they just put you on a no-fly list you can't buy guns
[58:04.600 --> 58:07.960]  now they've got bills introduced uh where Lieberman's out there promoting and
[58:07.960 --> 58:11.000]  has a good chance of passing that if they say they think you might be a
[58:11.000 --> 58:14.760]  terrorist your constitutional rights are stripped your citizenship is stripped
[58:14.760 --> 58:18.520]  and you're given to a secret military team and can be tortured
[58:18.520 --> 58:22.120]  this is an illegitimate criminal narcotics trafficking government
[58:22.120 --> 58:25.880]  stop shipping the drugs in government and stop using it as a pretext to pack
[58:25.880 --> 58:29.480]  your private prisons and raid people's houses while the cops get stinking
[58:29.480 --> 58:32.520]  rich of all the drug money and drugs they steal
[58:32.520 --> 58:35.800]  our government is a drug dealing criminal operation we have to take it back

[01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:55.160]  is now unfolding his prediction about the plunging stock market
[01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:58.280]  is now unfolding and another gentleman who's been right on target
[01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:02.040]  bob Chapman of the international forecaster he's joining us in one
[01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:05.400]  hour as well now in the first hour i did not
[01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:09.240]  get into what i believe went on yesterday
[01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:12.680]  mainly because i'm still studying it but i do agree
[01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:17.640]  with cnbc headline that is ridiculous this really sounds like market
[01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:22.280]  manipulation to me nine stocks
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:26.440]  simultaneously went down this was not some fat finger
[01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:29.800]  we know the plunge protection team manipulates the market now was this
[01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:33.080]  europe plunging and their markets being closed triggering this
[01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:36.200]  or was this insider trading which we know
[01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:41.720]  the major trade commission the groups that are over the stock exchanges
[01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:45.960]  i mean madeoff founded the nasdaq we know they're constantly involved in
[01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:49.000]  stuff like this but they're getting really bold now
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:53.560]  if this is a premeditated fraud we know they jacked the market back up almost
[01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:56.760]  a thousand points in just minutes that's never happened it's never dropped a
[01:01:56.760 --> 01:02:00.040]  thousand or been jacked up this fast so we know there's manipulation we know
[01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:03.160]  the story about fat fingers as a cover but we
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:07.400]  i don't know specifically yet exactly what happened we know it staged
[01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:10.680]  we just don't know specifically why we'll see if jerald salente and bob
[01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:14.040]  Chapman do jerald salente good to have you here with us
[01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:18.680]  hey thanks uh joining us via uh video skype from
[01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:22.440]  new york state uh let's talk about what just happened
[01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:25.480]  with the stock market then we'll get into greece
[01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:29.960]  well it's it's the crash of 2010 as we had forecast at the beginning of the
[01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:33.800]  year and what's happening is the stimulus money
[01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:38.200]  is running out worldwide and when anytime that there's a trigger like
[01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:42.280]  grease or something else the market is going to decline
[01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:46.040]  as you well pointed out we know these it's a rig game
[01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:49.560]  how it was rigged and who rigged it well that that
[01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:52.760]  that will never really get to the bottom of it we never know the truth of
[01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:56.360]  those things but i do believe that the market is
[01:02:56.360 --> 01:03:01.160]  unraveling and what they did do yesterday is they came in to
[01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:04.920]  and pulled out all the stops to jack it back up
[01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:09.080]  from not crashing and they're going to do it for a number of days and they're
[01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:13.080]  doing it globally there's no stopping the meltdown
[01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:23.000]  the markets collapsed alex in march of 2009 what they did was they pumped them
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:28.760]  up with all of the stimulus money it's as simple as that
[01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:37.240]  it's all of europe the united states the uk uh india china china with its free
[01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:43.480]  lending policies and stimulus japan south korea
[01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:48.440]  it's worldwide now it's running out just as we're seeing these phony
[01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:54.360]  unemployment numbers coming out they're only juiced up by the stimulus money
[01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:58.120]  when the stimulus runs out the markets crash
[01:03:58.120 --> 01:04:02.200]  the markets are now crashing now so here's the game
[01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:06.520]  the insider trading starts happening the big guys start pulling it out
[01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:11.080]  because they know what's coming next they jack it back up and then they get
[01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:14.440]  the shills out there to say listen this is a good
[01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:19.400]  buying opportunity the market is only going through a correction
[01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:22.920]  we have a lot of fundamental strength in the economy
[01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:28.040]  and they sucker the people back in so anyone that thinks that this is going
[01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:32.680]  to be a market that's going to grow in strength
[01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:36.840]  deserves what they get all right jerry events from future trends

[01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:46.040]  half before a year and a half after uh before what happened in greece you
[01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:49.240]  predicted it would start in greece portugal spain
[01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:53.160]  now they're saying england has his bigger debt ratio so does the us
[01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:56.040]  uh they're announcing a global implosion the banks
[01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:59.720]  we know we're engineering this in hijacking uh uh
[01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:03.800]  countries uh so break down where you see this going and what's happening
[01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:09.560]  with the markets and the next shoot a drop well the next shoot a drop uh
[01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:14.440]  appears to be happening again in europe first of all the
[01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:19.720]  what's going on in greece is going to explode into social unrest
[01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:23.720]  worldwide the people are not going to take it
[01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:27.480]  i love the white shoe boy language they use
[01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:32.120]  the average person has to suffer through their austerity measures
[01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:36.760]  so they could bail out who is it that's holding the bonds
[01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:42.440]  it's these huge hedge funds and banks they can't give them here's their
[01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:46.760]  language a haircut what do you mean you can't give them a haircut
[01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:51.240]  oh no they won't even get a trim you have to cover the losses
[01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:56.360]  in the united states the people's accept that a lot quicker than they do in
[01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:59.960]  europe the europeans know the story and they're not
[01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:05.240]  going to let it happen the next shoot a fall probably spain
[01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:11.640]  portugal then italy the uk is in terrible trouble we're going to see
[01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:18.280]  sovereign defaults around the world it's happened before and it's happened
[01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:23.320]  again let's make this 100 clear the only people
[01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:26.920]  that are getting bailed out are the two bigs
[01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:31.480]  they're not allowed to lose any money always under the guise
[01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:38.680]  that if we lose money the whole world system will collapse it's kind of like
[01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:43.000]  alex did you hear president obama recently
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:48.440]  when he addressed the wall street crowd a couple of weeks ago
[01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:54.200]  he called them the titans of industry what industry
[01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:59.960]  they're not making cars they're not producing steel or building railroads
[01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:05.240]  the only thing they make are profits and they're not titans of industry
[01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:09.480]  you know who they are they're bookies call it what it is
[01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:13.640]  but they're super bookies these are guys that not only are
[01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:19.720]  touts at the racetrack they also field the horses
[01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:25.000]  thoroughbreds that are really nags credit the fall swap
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:29.160]  auction rate security that's all they are
[01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:36.280]  synthetic credit the fall swaps special investment vehicles the whole
[01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:41.640]  fraudulent system is collapsing and the governments are going to crack down on
[01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:46.120]  the little people so they can pay off the gambling
[01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:52.840]  debts made by the big losses number two as the markets collapse
[01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:56.360]  what they're going to do the big guys are going to bail out
[01:12:56.360 --> 01:13:02.360]  as i have mentioned what they'll say is that the markets are rebounding i can't
[01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:05.880]  make this stuff up as i said to you just several minutes
[01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:10.360]  earlier they're going to say this is a good buying opportunity
[01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:15.880]  well between the time i said that and the break that happened to now i just
[01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:22.360]  heard the clowns on cnbc say it's a great buying opportunity
[01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:27.000]  to jump into the stock markets in europe oh yeah
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:31.240]  it's a great opportunity to jump on to the lucetania
[01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:35.080]  it's going to have a lovely trip across the ocean
[01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:39.960]  anybody that buys into the markets or that buys into these lies
[01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:43.560]  deserves what they get
[01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:49.160]  gerald i'm just speechless here as you go over this i mean we have the golden
[01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:52.840]  sacks internal emails we have the jp morgan internal info
[01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:56.040]  they premeditatedly going back four years ago
[01:13:56.040 --> 01:14:00.360]  sold government sold pension funds sold private individuals
[01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:04.200]  derivatives that they knew were worthless while they were preparing to
[01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:08.440]  bet against them and in their own emails they say this will destroy
[01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:13.480]  our competition but the media is only focusing on the timber wolf emails
[01:14:13.480 --> 01:14:17.720]  with golden sacks when the others are far worse and now they're announcing don't
[01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:20.840]  worry we're engaged in financial terrorism
[01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:24.760]  give us unlimited trillions and will
[01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:28.120]  you know bring back the good times but then separately two weeks ago in the
[01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:31.640]  washington post the head of the imf bragged he said
[01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:35.720]  for rich nations this was the headline the good times are over
[01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:38.600]  the party's over you're not going to be able to retire
[01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:41.800]  we're going to take your pension funds they're getting ready for it here
[01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:45.320]  you know our media won't say why the greeks are rioting they just say
[01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:48.040]  austerity but when we talk about austerity
[01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:51.560]  gerald solante explained to people what austerity means
[01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:56.600]  under these made-off types well what it means is is that everybody's standard of
[01:14:56.600 --> 01:15:01.400]  living declines they tax you to death they make it more and
[01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:05.240]  more impossible for small people to get into businesses
[01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:09.160]  because they put more and more charges on top of them
[01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:13.800]  and direct all the business to the big guys let's make this really clear about
[01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:18.040]  this bailout going to greece number one
[01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:23.000]  it's against the the european monetary union charter
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:28.920]  for any bailouts number two it's explicitly against the european
[01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:33.880]  monetary union charter for an imf bailout who's the biggest
[01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:38.680]  funder of the imf us we the people of the united
[01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:42.760]  states we're the people that are now bailing out
[01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:47.480]  the banks the jp morgan chase the golem and sacks gang
[01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:51.160]  the meryl lynch marl the credits swiss
[01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:55.640]  where is all this money going to it's going to the bankers
[01:15:55.640 --> 01:16:00.040]  number one it's against the economic the european monetary union
[01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:05.480]  and number two now we're footing the bill so these guys can get bailed out
[01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:10.600]  what you're seeing happening in greece with the people taking to the streets
[01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:15.880]  is going to happen worldwide i want to make this very clear
[01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:19.800]  because alex this is going to lead one of the
[01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:26.120]  elements leading to the great war systems are going to be breaking down
[01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:29.080]  they're not going to be able to stop the people
[01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:32.040]  any more than they're able to stop them in thailand
[01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:36.360]  thailand hardly makes the news people don't know anything of what's going on
[01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:39.480]  there you've heard me say this over and over again
[01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:43.880]  my expression as a bronx guy is when people lose everything
[01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:47.320]  and they have nothing left to lose they're losing it
[01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:51.080]  and they're going to be losing it against the red carpet crowd
[01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:54.200]  who believe that they are the entitled people
[01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:58.600]  that they could fix everything if only you give them anything
[01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:02.520]  everything and i want to add something to that because the magnitude of this
[01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:06.840]  fraud with banker bailouts they're not bailouts they make money on the way up
[01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:10.920]  selling the crud then when the governments and
[01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:14.440]  companies and pension funds that have bought the fraud
[01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:19.480]  start imploding the government gives taxpayer money as a bailout
[01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:24.760]  to the private banks that engineered the fraud to then lend the money
[01:17:24.760 --> 01:17:30.120]  to the government or to the pension fund that's now bankrupt and then now those
[01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:34.200]  pension funds are even in more debt to the same bankers that engineered it so
[01:17:34.200 --> 01:17:38.920]  to sort of quantify this we loan the banks the money
[01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:45.400]  that they then loan us back i mean this is fraud on top of fraud on top of
[01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:48.440]  fraud and you notice that as soon as they agreed
[01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:54.440]  to the 146.5 billion for Greece that suddenly
[01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:58.600]  portugal and spain started going under because the banks said look they bought
[01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:02.200]  this now let's trigger it here and so they're holding all of his
[01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:06.920]  hostage and they own the mainstream media and so the mainstream media
[01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:09.960]  most of the time will not tell the truth dylan radigan
[01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:13.560]  does occasionally they let ron paul on sometimes to tell the truth but i mean
[01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:17.560]  here's the washington post headline for nations living the good life
[01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:21.480]  the party is over imf says washington post
[01:18:21.480 --> 01:18:26.280]  but i mean going back to that the the level of
[01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:33.240]  well that was crazy that sounded like one of those party party horns i guess
[01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:37.400]  we lost gerald salente that happens occasionally with the video skype
[01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:40.840]  connections so we're going to connect back to gerald salente
[01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:46.840]  and continue along those lines with our guest today special effects brought to
[01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:50.360]  you by skype i guess we have gerald back
[01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:53.560]  we don't okay we're going to go to break in a moment and i'm going to bring that
[01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:56.760]  question back to him after the break
[01:18:56.760 --> 01:19:01.640]  it isn't just that the banks sell derivatives and then the economy
[01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:04.680]  implodes and then we have to bail the nations out
[01:19:04.680 --> 01:19:08.600]  when you read about this greek plan or the u.s plan or what happened in england
[01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:15.320]  in the last wave our money then goes to the banks gerald
[01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:18.200]  you got caught off we're going to break but start answering the question
[01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:21.880]  about how we loaned them our money to loan back to us
[01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:26.840]  yeah but you see you left one element out alec you have to be fair about this
[01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:33.320]  they give the the government all of their toxic crap as collateral
[01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:37.960]  that's what they use as the sham to make it legitimate
[01:19:37.960 --> 01:19:41.880]  and that's what's been going on the governments around the world
[01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:45.960]  have been using this lie that they have collateral
[01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:49.720]  so that they can then loan the banks money at near zero
[01:19:49.720 --> 01:19:53.240]  interest rates so that the banks could go at back out
[01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:57.480]  re-loan it to us and continuing their gambling all right stay there we got to
[01:19:57.480 --> 01:20:01.240]  go to break it so you're right it's even worse than i was saying
[01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:04.040]  we all know that the burki water purification systems are the most

[01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:46.680]  i can't even properly describe how big the fraud is they sell the derivatives
[01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:49.880]  knowing it's crap they have insurance companies certify it the
[01:24:49.880 --> 01:24:54.040]  insurance companies get bailed out after they already get paid to certify it
[01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:58.600]  uh... the big banks uh... get to fence the assets and my real assets
[01:24:58.600 --> 01:25:02.840]  when the bubbles being inflated them when it implodes the banks get bailed
[01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:06.680]  out uh... with trillions of dollars and then they say all but we're going to
[01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:10.680]  give the government's the toxic assets and every economist we've talked to
[01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:13.320]  have said that those have negative value
[01:25:13.320 --> 01:25:16.280]  so they're actually giving the government's a time bomb so it's a
[01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:19.800]  triple screw job that's right and let's not forget the
[01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:24.440]  rating agencies as you mentioned you know they get a free ride as well
[01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:28.680]  they're getting paid to rate the junk and they rate the junk
[01:25:28.680 --> 01:25:32.440]  excellent you can't get away with this in real life
[01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:37.400]  and i've said this over and over again the merger of state and corporate
[01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:41.880]  powers is called fascism and fascism has come to america
[01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:46.920]  we're talking about the financial sector we could talk about it in agriculture
[01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:52.360]  we could talk about it in pharmaceutical we can talk about it in retail
[01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:58.760]  every sector of this country is controlled by a handful what is it alex
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:06.120]  six banks controlling 60 percent of all of the action in the country
[01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:12.600]  how can you deny what's going on you can't this is not socialism
[01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:16.280]  and i heard you talking about before i came on the air
[01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:21.320]  about these drug busts and how they use these fascist tactics
[01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:25.160]  to beat up people to beat up the little guy for
[01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:28.760]  you know smoking a joint while they let the big guys
[01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:33.320]  free and turn quote a blind eye to oprium production
[01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:38.360]  in afghanistan because they don't want to hurt the family farm as income
[01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:42.440]  who are they kidding with this stuff so what we're looking at
[01:26:42.440 --> 01:26:46.760]  is really a complete takeover and when people say
[01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:50.600]  why isn't the government doing anything
[01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:54.520]  they think that there's a revolving door that's the story that they've been
[01:26:54.520 --> 01:26:57.480]  fed well you know the people go out of government
[01:26:57.480 --> 01:27:01.480]  and then into these private corporations and they you know they have an
[01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:05.720]  inside track it's not a revolving door it's a
[01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:09.880]  wide open door and that door is filled with
[01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:16.200]  the same people in every agency that are fronting for the big corporations
[01:27:16.200 --> 01:27:20.680]  whether it's the goldman sacks gang or whether it's agriculture
[01:27:20.680 --> 01:27:26.520]  it's the same story over and over again well look at walmart globally has 46
[01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:30.440]  percent of all retail sales and it's all based on chinese
[01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:34.440]  slave goods what about mark faber i know you respect his opinion he's got a
[01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:38.120]  very good track record of predicting things uh just in the market so you
[01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:41.160]  have you know general analysis which is so important
[01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:45.000]  but he's saying 90 chance in the next nine to 12 months
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:49.320]  that china will completely collapse into depression
[01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:52.680]  oh we've been saying this as well it's the chinese bubble
[01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:58.680]  everyone knows that one of the major reasons why we have recovered with this
[01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:03.640]  fake recovery from the march 2009 equities market
[01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:08.600]  collapse is because of china and china has dumped in
[01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:12.840]  nearly a trillion dollars worth of money plus they're loaning out money all
[01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:16.040]  over they have a huge housing bubble going on
[01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:20.920]  there and i do respect mark faber's analysis as
[01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:25.720]  bob chatman's as well and faber's right on the money with this
[01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:29.800]  because there's another problem going on in china and again this is where we
[01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:32.920]  look at a bit differently than a lot of others
[01:28:32.920 --> 01:28:37.000]  and that is the social unrest they've had over 70
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:42.200]  thousand major riots and disturbances in china
[01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:48.920]  in 2009 they have to keep their 1.2 billion people happy
[01:28:48.920 --> 01:28:53.480]  because if they don't the whole thing turns to chaos
[01:28:53.480 --> 01:28:59.480]  and it's going to be chaos in china as the world economies decline and they
[01:28:59.480 --> 01:29:04.120]  have no place to dump their product so yes we agree
[01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:07.960]  there's going to be a major unraveling in china
[01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:11.080]  now we're about to break long segment coming up we'll take some calls and get
[01:29:11.080 --> 01:29:15.000]  into other trends but i've got a twitter question to the real
[01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:19.560]  alex jones twitter by ferrera it says i'd like to know if he has the
[01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:23.560]  same forecast for financial collapse that he had one year ago have things
[01:29:23.560 --> 01:29:27.240]  changed or have things accelerated well let me just answer that question and
[01:29:27.240 --> 01:29:31.240]  then have him come back and elaborate he said almost four years ago that in
[01:29:31.240 --> 01:29:35.000]  2008 there'd be a huge implosion that's on record
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:38.600]  and he described it in the subprime mortgages as the trigger
[01:29:38.600 --> 01:29:43.400]  then he said right after the bailout in 2008 that 2010
[01:29:43.400 --> 01:29:47.080]  and chatman said this too that the money would run out and then the big
[01:29:47.080 --> 01:29:51.000]  implosion would start we'll be back
[01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:54.840]  we're on the march the empires on the run
[01:29:54.840 --> 01:30:00.440]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:30:00.440 --> 01:30:05.480]  they helped to create a new world order we are part of a new world order a new
[01:30:05.480 --> 01:30:10.280]  world order based upon collective action invisible empire is a damning
[01:30:10.280 --> 01:30:13.720]  indictment of the globalist through their own words and documents the new
[01:30:13.720 --> 01:30:17.960]  world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities
[01:30:17.960 --> 01:30:22.040]  it means all the world under their control the united nations would take
[01:30:22.040 --> 01:30:26.120]  over america the trilateral commission would control the world
[01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:30.200]  invisible empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in
[01:30:30.200 --> 01:30:34.040]  stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government
[01:30:34.040 --> 01:30:38.040]  i believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution
[01:30:38.040 --> 01:30:41.480]  for the global financial system global governance with the establishment of
[01:30:41.480 --> 01:30:44.680]  the g20 so it's going to be an inner ruling elite
[01:30:44.680 --> 01:30:48.440]  and then everyone else and i got news for you you're everyone else

[01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:21.080]  specific with him in a moment and get into the next phase in the collapse
[01:33:21.080 --> 01:33:24.920]  how he sees this historically unwinding and unfolding bob chatman will also
[01:33:24.920 --> 01:33:27.960]  join us next hour to specifically burrow in
[01:33:27.960 --> 01:33:31.960]  to his research i know he's on it to find out exactly what happened yesterday
[01:33:31.960 --> 01:33:36.120]  the word is there was a lot of people that were short on gold in europe
[01:33:36.120 --> 01:33:40.440]  and that they had to dump stock to be able to cover their position
[01:33:40.440 --> 01:33:44.120]  and we know it wasn't a fat finger it wasn't procter and gamble that's even
[01:33:44.120 --> 01:33:48.440]  cnbc admits it was at least nine stocks simultaneously
[01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:52.840]  that did this and they halted trading in europe a lot of chicanery
[01:33:52.840 --> 01:33:57.240]  we have a specialist on that issue alone bob chatman joining us next hour
[01:33:57.240 --> 01:34:01.240]  before we go back to our guest we produced and released
[01:34:01.240 --> 01:34:05.800]  two new films in the month of april i released
[01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:09.640]  of course invisible empire in order to find which is just excellent
[01:34:09.640 --> 01:34:12.840]  exposing the new world order the global government who these people are how to
[01:34:12.840 --> 01:34:16.760]  stop them government drug dealing government
[01:34:16.760 --> 01:34:20.600]  kidnapping white slavery how they're bribing people how they're controlling
[01:34:20.600 --> 01:34:24.360]  them what the banks are doing and police state for the rise of fema
[01:34:24.360 --> 01:34:27.640]  how they're planning to suppress the people training to take on the tea parties
[01:34:27.640 --> 01:34:31.320]  training the military to take on the american people the reality of the fema
[01:34:31.320 --> 01:34:34.360]  camps it's all proven in police state for the rise of fema
[01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:38.440]  but remember william lewis who made camp fema and a lot of other great films

[01:37:38.360 --> 01:37:42.520]  but going back to this first twitter question that i
[01:37:42.520 --> 01:37:46.760]  posed as we went to break i'd like to know if he has the same forecast for
[01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:50.760]  financial collapse that he had one year ago have things changed so
[01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:53.960]  you've been dead on about exactly what would happen even the countries where
[01:37:53.960 --> 01:37:57.160]  it would start do you want to revise that any because
[01:37:57.160 --> 01:38:01.320]  you have new info and and then i will add the caveat the proviso
[01:38:01.320 --> 01:38:05.240]  and what do you see coming in the year after that what comes next
[01:38:05.240 --> 01:38:10.440]  here it is it's this came out on when it was released in january 13th the top
[01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:16.440]  trend the crash of 2010 we stick with our forecast
[01:38:16.440 --> 01:38:21.400]  before the new year begins no one will be able to deny
[01:38:21.400 --> 01:38:26.600]  that the great equity markets have crashed the currencies are being
[01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:33.640]  devalued around the world gold prices are well over $1500
[01:38:33.640 --> 01:38:38.440]  we are sticking with our forecast that the markets will crash
[01:38:38.440 --> 01:38:43.480]  before the year is out and i also want to make this very clear
[01:38:43.480 --> 01:38:46.920]  it's not only going to be a financial crash
[01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:50.200]  it's going to come from a lot of different directions
[01:38:50.200 --> 01:38:55.880]  our greatest fear and we've said this when they began the great bailout bubble
[01:38:55.880 --> 01:39:02.440]  in march of 2009 is that when all else fails they take you to war
[01:39:02.440 --> 01:39:08.440]  so what we our scenario is this alex we're going to see 9 11 magnitude
[01:39:08.440 --> 01:39:13.320]  terror strikes happen when they happen the last time they
[01:39:13.320 --> 01:39:18.040]  happened after 2001 they closed wall street down for
[01:39:18.040 --> 01:39:23.000]  several days if you had cds you couldn't cash them in
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:28.440]  their financial instruments this time they're going to close the banks
[01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:32.040]  and when they reopen the banks we forecast
[01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:38.040]  they will have devalued the dollar so they'll say don't worry about it
[01:39:38.040 --> 01:39:41.720]  you'll be able to get your money out it's backed by the fdic
[01:39:41.720 --> 01:39:45.960]  but you can't get it out all at once and when you do get it out
[01:39:45.960 --> 01:39:49.400]  it's not going to be worth a fraction of what it was before
[01:39:49.400 --> 01:39:52.920]  so these are the integrated systems that we're looking at
[01:39:52.920 --> 01:39:59.080]  and i'm saying this so that people take proactive measures now
[01:39:59.080 --> 01:40:04.200]  don't wait to wake up one day as you did yesterday
[01:40:04.200 --> 01:40:09.720]  and see the markets collapse around you take proactive measures now it doesn't
[01:40:09.720 --> 01:40:12.840]  cost anything but if you don't plan for the
[01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:16.680]  worst now and the worst happens then you'll lose
[01:40:16.680 --> 01:40:22.280]  everything if you take measures now and things happen slowly
[01:40:22.280 --> 01:40:26.840]  you haven't lost anything you've gained so what do we do get a lot of our money
[01:40:26.840 --> 01:40:29.640]  out of the bank most people don't even have any money to get out of the bank
[01:40:29.640 --> 01:40:33.960]  what do you do get some storeable food water get a second job now so you're
[01:40:33.960 --> 01:40:37.080]  ready for what's coming uh warn your neighbors so they'll
[01:40:37.080 --> 01:40:41.000]  have some respect for you and listen to you when all this comes true
[01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:45.240]  uh i mean what do we do gerald all of those things number one about the
[01:40:45.240 --> 01:40:50.280]  neighbors like-minded people forming groups in the event the worst
[01:40:50.280 --> 01:40:53.800]  happens then you have a strategy and a plan
[01:40:53.800 --> 01:40:58.920]  you can work together it's the community keep your money don't spend a
[01:40:58.920 --> 01:41:02.680]  dime you don't have to spend especially on junk
[01:41:02.680 --> 01:41:06.920]  and eating crappy food cook your own make it better
[01:41:06.920 --> 01:41:11.720]  the survival strategies that you talk about with the seeds and the water
[01:41:11.720 --> 01:41:16.440]  number three any money that you do have
[01:41:16.440 --> 01:41:20.600]  i keep it in my own hands why keep it in the bank what are you getting from
[01:41:20.600 --> 01:41:23.640]  putting it there you're only taking a risk
[01:41:23.640 --> 01:41:28.920]  speaking only for myself i'm a firm believer in gold
[01:41:28.920 --> 01:41:32.280]  80 percent of my gold my assets are in gold
[01:41:32.280 --> 01:41:36.600]  and then people you know i see these comments they say oh salentes involved
[01:41:36.600 --> 01:41:39.560]  with you know gold companies no i'm not
[01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:45.000]  i don't take a penny from anybody so it's only what i do and what i believe
[01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:48.920]  and i've been writing about it for years and number three
[01:41:48.920 --> 01:41:53.320]  or number four i'm a believer in second amendment rights
[01:41:53.320 --> 01:41:57.000]  make sure you're on for the worst to happen because you're going to see
[01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:01.880]  violence increase at a very rapid rate so those are the kind of initial things
[01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:06.120]  to consider grow your own those crisis gardens that you talk
[01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:09.720]  about the summer is coming upon us you could grow
[01:42:09.720 --> 01:42:15.160]  all the food you need to feed your family and have a lot left over and put it
[01:42:15.160 --> 01:42:19.240]  up for the winter so anything you can do that yanky
[01:42:19.240 --> 01:42:23.000]  frugality let's go back to the things that made this
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:27.880]  country what it was use it up wear it out make it do
[01:42:27.880 --> 01:42:33.560]  do without well expanding on that i think about my grandfather on my dad's
[01:42:33.560 --> 01:42:38.280]  side he would repair his own equipment
[01:42:38.280 --> 01:42:42.520]  i mean you talk about MacGyver and and all those old farmers and ranchers were
[01:42:42.520 --> 01:42:46.280]  like that my dad has a lot of those skills i don't have one tenth of the
[01:42:46.280 --> 01:42:49.320]  skills my dad has he has probably half the skills
[01:42:49.320 --> 01:42:53.880]  his father had and everybody knew even in good times to have storeable food
[01:42:53.880 --> 01:42:57.960]  to be prepared to save money because they'd gone through the great depression
[01:42:57.960 --> 01:43:01.560]  and if we had right at 90 percent of the public
[01:43:01.560 --> 01:43:05.960]  being rural during the great depression and being self-sufficient and still
[01:43:05.960 --> 01:43:09.320]  major universities have estimated 17 million starved to death
[01:43:09.320 --> 01:43:13.720]  over those 10 years and now we have 89 percent being
[01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:17.240]  being urban and only about 11 percent being rural
[01:43:17.240 --> 01:43:20.680]  only half of the rural are somewhat self-sufficient
[01:43:20.680 --> 01:43:25.320]  in national studies if we have another meltdown depression like that
[01:43:25.320 --> 01:43:28.600]  nobody's going to be able to take care of you the government the banks
[01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:31.960]  they couldn't even help with Katrina they can't even stop an oil leak
[01:43:31.960 --> 01:43:35.480]  i mean my god we're talking about a road warrior situation
[01:43:35.480 --> 01:43:39.240]  and i see the reports with their land off half the teachers in some cities
[01:43:39.240 --> 01:43:43.320]  more than half the cops half the sheriff's deputies and the half they keep
[01:43:43.320 --> 01:43:47.320]  are there in the news being told they're just there to raise revenue and write
[01:43:47.320 --> 01:43:50.760]  tickets for the government so and i'm starting to see a lot of
[01:43:50.760 --> 01:43:53.880]  sheriffs in texas and pennsylvania and ohio
[01:43:53.880 --> 01:43:58.680]  say buy guns you've got to protect yourself so we're seeing the veneer
[01:43:58.680 --> 01:44:03.720]  of the civilization the rotten paint starting to peel off
[01:44:03.720 --> 01:44:07.560]  yeah and and you said it about in the old days people knew how to do it
[01:44:07.560 --> 01:44:12.280]  themselves you know i own i own a 1994 outie
[01:44:12.280 --> 01:44:16.360]  i could buy anything that i want to buy i don't want one of those cars
[01:44:16.360 --> 01:44:19.480]  and i don't want i don't need all those gadgets
[01:44:19.480 --> 01:44:22.520]  you know kick the addiction and by the way
[01:44:22.520 --> 01:44:27.560]  stop wasting your money and go into college and getting a degree in business
[01:44:27.560 --> 01:44:31.240]  administration and this is a lot of baloney
[01:44:31.240 --> 01:44:35.240]  if you're going to go to college only do it
[01:44:35.240 --> 01:44:39.320]  for a skill that you can get a return on investment
[01:44:39.320 --> 01:44:43.800]  that's one of the biggest rackets in this country we talk about the military
[01:44:43.800 --> 01:44:47.640]  industrial complex we talk about big pharma big
[01:44:47.640 --> 01:44:52.760]  big food it's also the college industrial complex
[01:44:52.760 --> 01:44:55.720]  this is one of the greatest scams going on
[01:44:55.720 --> 01:45:00.760]  in the world i love it oh my my son got a scholarship
[01:45:00.760 --> 01:45:04.840]  oh not a full scholarship a partial scholarship
[01:45:04.840 --> 01:45:09.400]  how much is it gonna cost oh only about twenty thousand dollars a year
[01:45:09.400 --> 01:45:12.440]  oh it would have cost forty thousand dollars a year
[01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:16.200]  yeah you know what it's like it's like going to one of these bizzars
[01:45:16.200 --> 01:45:20.360]  in turkey where they give you all you could buy it for this price
[01:45:20.360 --> 01:45:24.920]  they'll get any dollar that they can get you're wasting your money
[01:45:24.920 --> 01:45:29.880]  sending your kid to school if they're not going to get a diploma
[01:45:29.880 --> 01:45:34.040]  that's going to buy them a job stop this nonsense
[01:45:34.040 --> 01:45:38.680]  and put the money to to good use and if you want to get a skill
[01:45:38.680 --> 01:45:43.160]  in business administration start as an apprentice
[01:45:43.160 --> 01:45:46.760]  working for somebody but that's the way it was done that's the way it was done
[01:45:46.760 --> 01:45:49.800]  i mean i read about the founding fathers and then andrew jackson
[01:45:49.800 --> 01:45:52.840]  they were all apprentices that's how they got their law degree
[01:45:52.840 --> 01:45:57.080]  that's how they got their professorship is is is that is that there were a lot
[01:45:57.080 --> 01:45:59.960]  of people that wanted to be apprentices they only took the people that were
[01:45:59.960 --> 01:46:02.840]  smart and willing to work and that's what built this country was the
[01:46:02.840 --> 01:46:06.920]  apprenticeship system exactly people are wasting
[01:46:06.920 --> 01:46:10.840]  these kids are getting out of college with fifty thousand dollars in debt
[01:46:10.840 --> 01:46:15.160]  and they can't get a job stocking shelves at walmart
[01:46:15.160 --> 01:46:21.000]  at one in the morning i want to go to calls time goes so fast with gerald
[01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:24.760]  salente uh man we could spend 10 hours with him
[01:46:24.760 --> 01:46:26.840]  here i want to go to calls and ask you some other
[01:46:26.840 --> 01:46:30.120]  questions but quickly you've said some terrorist
[01:46:30.120 --> 01:46:33.480]  stage some of its provocateur we know that's true but you said no
[01:46:33.480 --> 01:46:37.480]  2010 pakistan is going to start attacking you said
[01:46:37.480 --> 01:46:42.680]  small attacks but also leading to huge attacks as big as 911
[01:46:42.680 --> 01:46:46.520]  and now we see the situation with pakistan uh go ahead
[01:46:46.520 --> 01:46:51.080]  i mean how did you predict that it's so easy to see the
[01:46:51.080 --> 01:46:54.840]  president obama the nobel peace prize winner
[01:46:54.840 --> 01:46:59.160]  and i wonder if norway is orwell spelled backwards
[01:46:59.160 --> 01:47:04.760]  they've expanded that war in in pakistan this brilliant af-pak strategy
[01:47:04.760 --> 01:47:08.760]  you know these these swivel chair generals and secretaries of this or
[01:47:08.760 --> 01:47:11.880]  that coming up with these wonderful strategies
[01:47:11.880 --> 01:47:15.400]  they're going to weed out the Taliban and al-qaeda
[01:47:15.400 --> 01:47:21.960]  on the afghan pakistan borders so pakistan is fighting this huge war
[01:47:21.960 --> 01:47:26.040]  there there's the greatest refugee crisis since rwanda
[01:47:26.040 --> 01:47:29.320]  they've now announced yesterday uh seeing in
[01:47:29.320 --> 01:47:33.800]  1000 drones and it says the kids piloting these by remote
[01:47:33.800 --> 01:47:37.320]  are allowed in fact print that again for me to kill anybody they want
[01:47:37.320 --> 01:47:41.560]  with no evidence they just said that they can just kill anybody who quote
[01:47:41.560 --> 01:47:45.400]  acts like a gorilla i i know these are called extra
[01:47:45.400 --> 01:47:51.320]  judicial killings white shoe boy languages and it's also what it is
[01:47:51.320 --> 01:47:55.720]  it's against international law so what's happening is
[01:47:55.720 --> 01:47:59.320]  president obama has already i think it's 34
[01:47:59.320 --> 01:48:04.280]  major drone strikes this year and uh by weekly and by the way
[01:48:04.280 --> 01:48:09.080]  the cia is is is behind it and they're not supposed to be involved in these
[01:48:09.080 --> 01:48:12.840]  kind of things so now here's the scenario
[01:48:12.840 --> 01:48:18.040]  your family gets killed your relatives are slaughtered maimed
[01:48:18.040 --> 01:48:22.280]  they've lost everything because of a huge proxy war
[01:48:22.280 --> 01:48:26.040]  that washington is fighting in in in pakistan
[01:48:26.040 --> 01:48:30.520]  you think you want to get even has nothing to do with al-qaeda
[01:48:30.520 --> 01:48:34.520]  or or uh or or the taliban oh it may
[01:48:34.520 --> 01:48:38.520]  but there's other things this is old is the old testament
[01:48:38.520 --> 01:48:42.280]  it's called revenge and we're going to see
[01:48:42.280 --> 01:48:47.720]  revenge attacks and then alex they come up with this fairy tale
[01:48:47.720 --> 01:48:53.240]  that by waging this war we're going to weed out the taliban and the al-qaeda
[01:48:53.240 --> 01:48:56.280]  on these borders of pakistan and afghanistan
[01:48:56.280 --> 01:49:00.760]  oh y'all are you how about getting rid of the bloods in the crypts of los
[01:49:00.760 --> 01:49:05.080]  angeles just start there before you move around the country
[01:49:05.080 --> 01:49:09.400]  they can't do that who in their right mind believes these fairy tales
[01:49:09.400 --> 01:49:13.480]  it's the military industrial complex that isan hour
[01:49:13.480 --> 01:49:18.120]  that's medley butler and other great americans warned us about and they know
[01:49:18.120 --> 01:49:21.640]  these guys and they know that it's going to cause
[01:49:21.640 --> 01:49:24.920]  people to attack and they want the attacks as a pretext
[01:49:24.920 --> 01:49:30.680]  to take our freedoms exactly so this is why we're talking about
[01:49:30.680 --> 01:49:33.960]  the economics collapse the economic collapse
[01:49:33.960 --> 01:49:38.680]  coming from many different directions because just like now
[01:49:38.680 --> 01:49:42.840]  what happened the oil spill was all over the news
[01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:46.840]  it drained from the news when the times square
[01:49:46.840 --> 01:49:52.120]  bomber surfaced well you know we've confirmed they were
[01:49:52.120 --> 01:49:56.840]  running a drill that whole thing looks suspicious to me
[01:49:56.840 --> 01:50:00.520]  but again what they'll do when there's a terrorist strike
[01:50:00.520 --> 01:50:04.120]  the people will rally behind the president
[01:50:04.120 --> 01:50:08.600]  look they did it with bush 92 percent of the people
[01:50:08.600 --> 01:50:15.960]  wanted to go attack afghanistan to bring back osama bin laden dead or alive
[01:50:15.960 --> 01:50:20.600]  it's nine years later you know what did what did the iranians quoted that he
[01:50:20.600 --> 01:50:24.200]  said he's in washington jerryl we're going to come back and
[01:50:24.200 --> 01:50:27.560]  take some calls and ask some quick questions and cover any other trends
[01:50:27.560 --> 01:50:31.320]  that you want to discuss here with us jerryl salente is our guest
[01:50:31.320 --> 01:50:34.120]  but going out of break i want to come back and have you answer this question
[01:50:34.120 --> 01:50:37.320]  briefly uh when you talk about a great war that's what
[01:50:37.320 --> 01:50:41.080]  governments always do when they're imploding is they launch a big war
[01:50:41.080 --> 01:50:45.240]  world war three style as a political distraction i mean is that what you're
[01:50:45.240 --> 01:50:49.240]  basically saying is coming we're saying world war three is on
[01:50:49.240 --> 01:50:52.840]  the way the riots in greece will spread across europe
[01:50:52.840 --> 01:50:59.960]  will spread east into ukraine into latvia stonia the world is going to be on

[01:54:21.560 --> 01:54:25.880]  i've got some twitter questions and randy shanky joe jeff and fred and others
[01:54:25.880 --> 01:54:29.240]  but a quick question Gerald Salente there's a lot of drum beating
[01:54:29.240 --> 01:54:32.280]  by the FCC by the media by the governments of the world
[01:54:32.280 --> 01:54:38.360]  to censor the internet uh a when do you see this world war three thing being
[01:54:38.360 --> 01:54:41.880]  watched be do you see them trying to clamp down on the web
[01:54:41.880 --> 01:54:44.920]  well when it happens they will clamp down on the web
[01:54:44.920 --> 01:54:49.560]  when they lose control every every every aspect where they lose control
[01:54:49.560 --> 01:54:52.600]  they will try to double up and gain more control
[01:54:52.600 --> 01:54:56.520]  the war is happening now uh it was announced
[01:54:56.520 --> 01:55:01.560]  just two days ago that president obama is going to step up the attacks in
[01:55:01.560 --> 01:55:07.320]  pakistan and from pakistan it could explode into india
[01:55:07.320 --> 01:55:10.440]  we don't know what israel is going to do with Iran
[01:55:10.440 --> 01:55:14.680]  the whole middle east is up for grabs there is no peace process
[01:55:14.680 --> 01:55:19.000]  it's only getting worse over there we can't put a specific date on it
[01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:23.320]  but it's in the making and unless the people really become aware of it
[01:55:23.320 --> 01:55:27.960]  stand up and and and step out and and speak out
[01:55:27.960 --> 01:55:32.280]  then we're doomed all right let's let's go to calls randy and texas thanks for
[01:55:32.280 --> 01:55:37.000]  holding go ahead quick question uh what do you recommend ordinary
[01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:41.800]  citizens do with their assets hard assets more
[01:55:41.800 --> 01:55:45.560]  more precisely what type should we get into
[01:55:45.560 --> 01:55:52.040]  well i i'm i'm not allowed by law to provide financial advice
[01:55:52.040 --> 01:55:56.120]  that's why i always make it clear this is what i would do
[01:55:56.120 --> 01:56:00.280]  and what i've done and i've said it over and over again very simple for me
[01:56:00.280 --> 01:56:04.040]  i buy gold 80 percent the rest of my money
[01:56:04.040 --> 01:56:08.680]  i have hedged i'm in dollars and i'm in canadian dollars
[01:56:08.680 --> 01:56:12.840]  one goes up the other goes down all i want is wealth
[01:56:12.840 --> 01:56:18.360]  preservation gold is my wildcard the other ones all i want to do is stay
[01:56:18.360 --> 01:56:21.960]  that's right in this game gold could be and this is for me personally
[01:56:21.960 --> 01:56:26.680]  speculatively it could go way up but bottom line it has real intrinsic value
[01:56:26.680 --> 01:56:30.760]  and so it is an emergency backup it's insurance i'm not
[01:56:30.760 --> 01:56:35.320]  looking in this danger zone to have big increases though gold is doing that
[01:56:35.320 --> 01:56:37.800]  i'm looking at wealth preservation thank you randy
[01:56:37.800 --> 01:56:41.880]  shanky and georgia you're on the air with bot with uh... drill salinity go ahead
[01:56:41.880 --> 01:56:45.800]  hey alex uh... thanks uh... congratulations but you and gerald for
[01:56:45.800 --> 01:56:48.840]  a great success y'all are having to get the word out
[01:56:48.840 --> 01:56:52.360]  uh... really appreciate what y'all are doing uh... my question results uh...
[01:56:52.360 --> 01:56:56.280]  y'all are talking about uh... money uh... holding cash taking money out of
[01:56:56.280 --> 01:57:00.840]  bank a lot of questions i get are revolved around full one case and i
[01:57:00.840 --> 01:57:05.560]  raise and um... you know with the reflation trade in the potential of a
[01:57:05.560 --> 01:57:08.200]  failed treasury auction and
[01:57:08.200 --> 01:57:12.040]  all the monetization uh... they they have discussed
[01:57:12.040 --> 01:57:16.200]  basically what their discussion in greek grease taken over the pension plan
[01:57:16.200 --> 01:57:19.720]  uh... gerald do you think they'll take the full one k the ira money's enforced
[01:57:19.720 --> 01:57:24.600]  into treasuries to uh... keep this country alive as long as possible
[01:57:24.600 --> 01:57:29.320]  if if a war breaks out that could be one of the things that they do
[01:57:29.320 --> 01:57:33.160]  there again what they'll use is they'll use a war or a terror attack
[01:57:33.160 --> 01:57:35.960]  to take any draconian measures that they can
[01:57:35.960 --> 01:57:39.960]  and hide behind them we sort with bush with the abrogation of
[01:57:39.960 --> 01:57:44.360]  so many of our rights under the patriot act with the eagle with the wire
[01:57:44.360 --> 01:57:47.960]  tapping on and on and on yes it becomes a probability
[01:57:47.960 --> 01:57:51.240]  and unfortunately i'm stuck in situations too
[01:57:51.240 --> 01:57:55.000]  you know i have to put money in ira's i think i get taxed very heavily
[01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:58.200]  you know so i have my money floating out in that as well
[01:57:58.200 --> 01:58:01.960]  but again my strategy is it's in and i know
[01:58:01.960 --> 01:58:05.960]  the downsides believe me but i have to do something
[01:58:05.960 --> 01:58:10.040]  i have my money in uh... in the ETFs
[01:58:10.040 --> 01:58:13.560]  in as i mentioned both dollars and and canadian
[01:58:13.560 --> 01:58:18.920]  and uh... end goal all right we're going to break here i would just add that
[01:58:18.920 --> 01:58:22.200]  treasury auctions are already failing uh...
[01:58:22.200 --> 01:58:25.080]  most of the new treasury auctions they have are not being a hundred percent
[01:58:25.080 --> 01:58:27.880]  bought by other institutions or governments
[01:58:27.880 --> 01:58:31.240]  the federal reserve is coming in and monetizing part of that debt
[01:58:31.240 --> 01:58:34.600]  correct gerald salante that's correct all right so
[01:58:34.600 --> 01:58:37.880]  the treasury auctions are already failing that's been going on for what a
[01:58:37.880 --> 01:58:42.760]  year and a half we'll be right back stay with us

[01:59:05.960 --> 01:59:09.480]  resulting in the restricted sale of many natural supplements
[01:59:09.480 --> 01:59:13.160]  including colloidal silver we must take immediate steps to assure a
[01:59:13.160 --> 01:59:17.160]  continuing supply of colloidal silver for ourselves and our families

[02:00:30.680 --> 02:00:33.720]  he says
[02:00:33.800 --> 02:00:37.720]  teratino asks what happens to the people that owe taxes
[02:00:37.720 --> 02:00:41.640]  and are under a payment plan you know california admits they raised all their
[02:00:41.640 --> 02:00:45.640]  taxes tax receipts went down they want to destroy the economy
[02:00:45.640 --> 02:00:48.840]  but what happens to all these people that are already barely hanging on
[02:00:48.840 --> 02:00:52.840]  that that have become bankrupt that owe all these taxes what happens to them in
[02:00:52.840 --> 02:00:57.240]  the depression jerald well they won't stop trying to
[02:00:57.240 --> 02:01:00.360]  collect your taxes they'll hand you to your grave
[02:01:00.360 --> 02:01:03.800]  we're going to see revolution in this country we've wrote a written about it
[02:01:03.800 --> 02:01:07.080]  before it's called the second american revolution
[02:01:07.080 --> 02:01:10.440]  it's the tax protest and the tea parties and once again
[02:01:10.440 --> 02:01:13.240]  you know we're not monday morning quarterbacks we predict that this is a
[02:01:13.240 --> 02:01:18.280]  top trend in 2007 tax revolts we call it the coalition of the cash
[02:01:18.280 --> 02:01:22.280]  strap so this country is going to be into a very difficult time and now it's the
[02:01:22.280 --> 02:01:25.880]  tea party well yeah the tea party is the beginning
[02:01:25.880 --> 02:01:29.240]  we've given it an official name what we see happening next
[02:01:29.240 --> 02:01:33.240]  it we're calling it the progressive libertarian
[02:01:33.240 --> 02:01:39.640]  progressive in terms of things like clean foods and clean water and and
[02:01:39.640 --> 02:01:43.800]  and vitamins and local local government local control another quick question
[02:01:43.800 --> 02:01:48.360]  here what are your predictions on the uk as a result of the hung parliament
[02:01:48.360 --> 02:01:52.520]  both economically and globally uh and and what's your prediction for the next
[02:01:52.520 --> 02:01:56.760]  countries to go down after greece portugal and spain
[02:01:56.760 --> 02:02:00.360]  the next countries to go down are going to be in eastern europe ukraine's
[02:02:00.360 --> 02:02:03.720]  already out and so many of the other small ones
[02:02:03.720 --> 02:02:08.680]  now the next big hit is going to be the uk the election in the uk means nothing
[02:02:08.680 --> 02:02:12.840]  it's like electing a republican or a democrat it goes basically in the same
[02:02:12.840 --> 02:02:16.760]  direction they don't have these genius minds
[02:02:16.760 --> 02:02:21.480]  that are going to be able to save the day so it's going to decline terribly
[02:02:21.480 --> 02:02:24.760]  more default small batmore banks going bust
[02:02:24.760 --> 02:02:28.520]  and more calls to bail them out as they get more desperate the criminals will
[02:02:28.520 --> 02:02:32.360]  only steal that much faster to move to their offshore islands as they're now
[02:02:32.360 --> 02:02:36.280]  doing joan mill walkie quick question for gerald salente
[02:02:36.280 --> 02:02:40.200]  yes uh wednesday the hundle's plot the german trade newspaper
[02:02:40.200 --> 02:02:44.600]  said that the battle is going to be uh begin against england and america
[02:02:44.600 --> 02:02:48.840]  because of retaliation there they sold all those shares
[02:02:48.840 --> 02:02:51.720]  and i'll give you the think tanks name it's called leap
[02:02:51.720 --> 02:02:56.760]  slash e twa 2020 all right let me get a comment on that a merkel came out
[02:02:56.760 --> 02:03:00.280]  yesterday in fact guys print me that article i didn't see it in my stack
[02:03:00.280 --> 02:03:04.920]  and and and called them evil malevolent bankers are doing this we've even got
[02:03:04.920 --> 02:03:08.280]  the politicians turning against the bankers now gerald
[02:03:08.280 --> 02:03:12.280]  well you know what merkel's doing is a public consumption because
[02:03:12.280 --> 02:03:16.040]  you know the germans don't want to bail out the greeks or anybody else
[02:03:16.040 --> 02:03:19.800]  but again it's the beginning of world war three we're seeing it happen
[02:03:19.800 --> 02:03:23.720]  in front of our eyes this is the way these things unfold
[02:03:23.720 --> 02:03:27.160]  and then when it happens they're going to say well it happened because they
[02:03:27.160 --> 02:03:30.760]  assassinated the archduke ferdinand you know so it's all
[02:03:30.760 --> 02:03:35.640]  bleeding up to that now the sides are being the people are getting on the
[02:03:35.640 --> 02:03:38.840]  different sides and the lines are being drawn
[02:03:38.840 --> 02:03:42.200]  again the new party progressive libertarian
[02:03:42.200 --> 02:03:45.320]  we're going to see it happen the country is going to
[02:03:45.320 --> 02:03:49.000]  enter into the second revolution so a new populist movement
[02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:53.880]  uh... quickly jeff in new york quick question for gerald salante
[02:03:53.880 --> 02:03:57.080]  okay two quick questions number one i live with these people here in new york

[02:04:07.240 --> 02:04:10.600]  don't sit where you are what you're going to do about these characters here
[02:04:10.600 --> 02:04:14.360]  second thing why don't we simply have a movement to say the old thing
[02:04:14.360 --> 02:04:17.880]  repudiate the debt well these people don't need to be paid

[02:10:31.480 --> 02:10:35.560]  when this happened yesterday in the second hour of the show was the third
[02:10:35.560 --> 02:10:39.320]  hour bat ryan we got several tv news
[02:10:39.320 --> 02:10:42.840]  programs on always in there they've got about eight monitors with different
[02:10:42.840 --> 02:10:46.360]  news on it we've got two tv monitors with cable on it
[02:10:46.360 --> 02:10:49.880]  bat ryan wanted to drop 300 points in a minute and a half
[02:10:49.880 --> 02:10:53.640]  said you got to put this on screen we put it on screen in the next five minutes
[02:10:53.640 --> 02:10:57.320]  it dropped right to a thousand points and then suddenly reversed
[02:10:57.320 --> 02:11:01.480]  this is the biggest one-day drop and rebound ever
[02:11:01.480 --> 02:11:06.760]  and bob Chapman is the leading expert specifically that we've interviewed
[02:11:06.760 --> 02:11:10.600]  with the accuracy of predictions he predicted the 2008
[02:11:10.600 --> 02:11:14.040]  he predicted it would slow down again in 2010 2011
[02:11:14.040 --> 02:11:17.880]  as the prime depression zone same thing the former head of the treasury
[02:11:17.880 --> 02:11:21.160]  the father of reaganomics dr paul craig roberts says they're destroying the
[02:11:21.160 --> 02:11:24.200]  economy by design we now have the goldman sacks emails
[02:11:24.200 --> 02:11:28.440]  confirming this this is command destruction like when a mosquito sticks
[02:11:28.440 --> 02:11:33.160]  its proboscis in your leg it pumps in an acid enzyme to dissolve the cells
[02:11:33.160 --> 02:11:38.520]  so it can suck up the blood they have injected us now they're sucking us dry
[02:11:38.520 --> 02:11:42.360]  and they are just out of control so i'm so glad we've got bob of the
[02:11:42.360 --> 02:11:45.720]  international forecaster on military intelligence the biggest
[02:11:45.720 --> 02:11:50.680]  silver and gold broker private broker and that's mainline news reporting that

[02:12:05.800 --> 02:12:11.240]  call of conspiracy he's been fighting for 45 years and we've got merkel
[02:12:11.240 --> 02:12:15.480]  blasting treacherous banks in greek crisis she's now saying they engineered
[02:12:15.480 --> 02:12:18.920]  it that's ahead of state so the rats are turning on each other
[02:12:18.920 --> 02:12:23.080]  that's out of french news agency here's bloomberg merkel slams greek scandal
[02:12:23.080 --> 02:12:27.480]  as goldman roll examined it's goldman in every case as bob Chapman told you 10
[02:12:27.480 --> 02:12:31.320]  years ago and so to discuss what happened yesterday
[02:12:31.320 --> 02:12:34.520]  and then where this melt i mean i remember him saying three years ago

[02:12:38.520 --> 02:12:42.280]  parliament in england they're saying england's got as big a debt ratio
[02:12:42.280 --> 02:12:45.880]  we're already having treasury auction failures the feds having to buy it
[02:12:45.880 --> 02:12:49.960]  california knew when they raised taxes that it would cause less receipts that
[02:12:49.960 --> 02:12:54.760]  was in the la times two days ago they know raising taxes and carbon taxes is
[02:12:54.760 --> 02:12:57.800]  going to bankrupt us they want to bankrupt us they're all
[02:12:57.800 --> 02:13:01.400]  or nothing in this is a criminal financial assault
[02:13:01.400 --> 02:13:07.000]  backed up by paramilitary military force this is it there's no more denial we
[02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:10.120]  were right about everything it stands on its own
[02:13:10.120 --> 02:13:15.080]  you better listen to us right now bob Chapman of the international forecaster
[02:13:15.080 --> 02:13:18.440]  good to have you with us for the rest of the hour break down what's going on
[02:13:18.440 --> 02:13:21.240]  because if anybody knows what happened yesterday
[02:13:21.240 --> 02:13:27.560]  it is that bloodhound bob Chapman well thank you very much and after all these
[02:13:27.560 --> 02:13:31.240]  years i've got to tell you alex and i'm going to tell you once
[02:13:31.240 --> 02:13:35.640]  you're brilliant uh thank you gerald gerald clump

[02:13:41.080 --> 02:13:45.640]  and mutual aberration uh what happened yesterday in the market
[02:13:45.640 --> 02:13:51.080]  uh we had selling come in from europe i understand it was two hedge funds
[02:13:51.080 --> 02:13:55.400]  and then the black boxes took over and uh
[02:13:55.400 --> 02:13:58.760]  you just described the results to drop a thousand points
[02:13:58.760 --> 02:14:01.560]  uh the government rushed in and ran it back up again
[02:14:01.560 --> 02:14:04.920]  uh there was no person pushing the wrong button
[02:14:04.920 --> 02:14:13.000]  uh that was a cover lie if you may and uh the market is now down 140 points
[02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:16.920]  today and headed south again and it's going to go down a long way when you
[02:14:16.920 --> 02:14:22.040]  get richard russell uh telling us uh the dow's going to a thousand
[02:14:22.040 --> 02:14:29.320]  i'm looking for um uh 2,800 to 3,200 uh so is in dav tithe
[02:14:29.320 --> 02:14:34.840]  and um and joe grandville as well and uh we all know each other
[02:14:34.840 --> 02:14:41.880]  and uh we don't communicate so we don't uh compare things and uh and so we'll
[02:14:41.880 --> 02:14:45.400]  run our way if you're in the stock market you better be out
[02:14:45.400 --> 02:14:49.640]  the only exception is golden silver shares and uh of course you should all
[02:14:49.640 --> 02:14:56.200]  be accumulating golden silver coins and so yesterday was on a scale of
[02:14:56.200 --> 02:15:01.320]  october the 19th 1987 i was in london that day
[02:15:01.320 --> 02:15:05.960]  and all heck broke was actually they had a hurricane the night before
[02:15:05.960 --> 02:15:10.120]  and uh and uh all the trees were down and everything
[02:15:10.120 --> 02:15:13.320]  but i had lunch with a fellow a friend of mine
[02:15:13.320 --> 02:15:16.840]  and uh actually two of them and one of them is from the bank of england
[02:15:16.840 --> 02:15:20.200]  and he says you never guess guess what's going on over at my office
[02:15:20.200 --> 02:15:24.840]  and i said what and of course that's this was after the second pint
[02:15:24.840 --> 02:15:29.320]  and uh he said the u.s through the imf is selling gold and he just docked down
[02:15:29.320 --> 02:15:35.080]  a hundred dollars illegally so this is nothing new
[02:15:35.080 --> 02:15:38.840]  and this is as damaging as what happened
[02:15:38.840 --> 02:15:45.640]  during late 1970 uh 1987 and that's why the brick and group in financial
[02:15:45.640 --> 02:15:50.120]  markets executive order was executed and finalized in
[02:15:50.120 --> 02:15:54.600]  august of the following year by ronald reagan he was misled
[02:15:54.600 --> 02:15:58.200]  sure he wanted to save markets when they were collapsing
[02:15:58.200 --> 02:16:02.440]  anybody would but what these people have done
[02:16:02.440 --> 02:16:07.000]  the goldmans and the morgans and so on treasury and the fed
[02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:11.720]  what they've done is use it 24 seven in every market in the world
[02:16:11.720 --> 02:16:16.040]  rigging it a command economy bob let's stop there for
[02:16:16.040 --> 02:16:19.640]  wait a minute the same thing that adolf hitler had
[02:16:19.640 --> 02:16:23.080]  go ahead no no i'm sorry to interrupt and start over

[02:16:48.040 --> 02:16:52.120]  collapsing they collapsed gold deliberately so people wouldn't think
[02:16:52.120 --> 02:16:55.720]  that there was something terribly wrong when in fact there was
[02:16:55.720 --> 02:17:00.760]  uh they've been doing that again under this working group in financial markets
[02:17:00.760 --> 02:17:04.760]  also known as the plunge protection team made up of the secretary of the
[02:17:04.760 --> 02:17:08.840]  treasury the head of the fed reserve head of the fed of new york head of the
[02:17:08.840 --> 02:17:15.080]  fcc and the cftc and they have crews that work 24 seven
[02:17:15.080 --> 02:17:19.160]  and their orders generally come either from the treasury of the fed
[02:17:19.160 --> 02:17:22.680]  and they have a joint committee as well and so they were in there rigging all
[02:17:22.680 --> 02:17:25.720]  the time and this has been going on for a long time
[02:17:25.720 --> 02:17:32.760]  and so this is why you can't get true markets and the differences
[02:17:32.760 --> 02:17:36.360]  between what's going on now and what has gone on before
[02:17:36.360 --> 02:17:43.960]  is in this command economy it's a combination of corporate entities
[02:17:43.960 --> 02:17:49.640]  and government working together in fact the corporate entities control the
[02:17:49.640 --> 02:17:53.160]  government and they control all the politicians
[02:17:53.160 --> 02:17:57.720]  who they can buy off which is most all of them that's why it's so important
[02:17:57.720 --> 02:18:03.800]  you gotta kick all these incumbent incumbents out uh in this coming election
[02:18:03.800 --> 02:18:07.640]  both in the house and those who are running in the senate to give us a chance
[02:18:07.640 --> 02:18:13.480]  of implementing something that will change the course i get rid of the
[02:18:13.480 --> 02:18:16.840]  patriot acts uh get rid of executive orders
[02:18:16.840 --> 02:18:24.440]  lobbying uh campaign contributions i mean the fed reserve i could go on and on
[02:18:24.440 --> 02:18:30.040]  and that's that's a course we've got to take now bob to inject a question here
[02:18:30.040 --> 02:18:33.640]  yesterday listening to news radio 590 after i got off air
[02:18:33.640 --> 02:18:38.760]  i heard broker after broker but i heard private day trader after day trader
[02:18:38.760 --> 02:18:41.640]  and then i went and looked it up and found out that this indeed did happen the
[02:18:41.640 --> 02:18:44.760]  news reported it but just as a minor footnote
[02:18:44.760 --> 02:18:52.280]  that while this was happening everyone was locked out of the stock markets
[02:18:52.280 --> 02:18:55.480]  and so the public couldn't go in and buy while it was going down
[02:18:55.480 --> 02:19:00.280]  they couldn't buy while it was going up and and as you said the black boxes
[02:19:00.280 --> 02:19:03.800]  took over and so they can't say hey we rig the market
[02:19:03.800 --> 02:19:07.480]  they tell you somebody had a fat finger but even cnbc
[02:19:07.480 --> 02:19:11.240]  has had analysts on saying look it was a whole bunch of stocks
[02:19:11.240 --> 02:19:14.360]  this wasn't just proctor and gamble and it was
[02:19:14.360 --> 02:19:17.960]  huge plunges on the european stock exchanges
[02:19:17.960 --> 02:19:21.080]  that caused this so they think we're so dumb
[02:19:21.080 --> 02:19:25.160]  they basically tell us a cow kicked over a lantern
[02:19:25.160 --> 02:19:29.560]  well you're absolutely right and uh those people
[02:19:29.560 --> 02:19:34.120]  saying those things were right as well uh the black box trading has got to be
[02:19:34.120 --> 02:19:37.640]  stopped derivatives have to be terminated
[02:19:37.640 --> 02:19:40.920]  and that's part of the things that we have to change well let's explain what
[02:19:40.920 --> 02:19:44.120]  black box trading is and your perspective
[02:19:44.120 --> 02:19:48.360]  on where the economy is going dr roberts on this a few weeks ago
[02:19:48.360 --> 02:19:52.440]  said that he is now revising his forecast and saying we could have a full bore
[02:19:52.440 --> 02:19:56.200]  total depression even quicker we're basically already
[02:19:56.200 --> 02:20:01.240]  in a depression bob shatman is our guest stay there
[02:20:01.240 --> 02:20:04.760]  hi this is alex jones did you know that the global elite are now storing

[02:20:08.120 --> 02:20:11.480]  did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more
[02:20:11.480 --> 02:20:14.760]  valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds have all performed even
[02:20:14.760 --> 02:20:17.720]  gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even
[02:20:17.720 --> 02:20:20.840]  happen again so our friends at solutions from science
[02:20:20.840 --> 02:20:23.960]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds

[02:24:58.600 --> 02:25:01.880]  finger did this that destroys confidence right there
[02:25:01.880 --> 02:25:05.400]  but it also trains the public that oh it can go up and down all day
[02:25:05.400 --> 02:25:09.240]  this is not your opinion this is on record that there's the plunge
[02:25:09.240 --> 02:25:13.400]  protection team it's on record it's used all over the world it's on record
[02:25:13.400 --> 02:25:16.680]  it's used by insiders and the goldman sacks and others have special computer
[02:25:16.680 --> 02:25:22.920]  programs that defraud this and but still i was on a radio show yesterday and
[02:25:22.920 --> 02:25:26.360]  they were doubting me that this even exist people better find out about this
[02:25:26.360 --> 02:25:30.120]  shouldn't they absolutely and they're in the
[02:25:30.120 --> 02:25:33.000]  denial many of these people they never heard this before
[02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:35.960]  they don't want to hear it and if they did hear it they don't want to talk
[02:25:35.960 --> 02:25:38.600]  about it because it might cost them their job
[02:25:38.600 --> 02:25:42.040]  so you have this giant blackmail going on
[02:25:42.040 --> 02:25:46.920]  on something that is an historical fact something that functions 24-7
[02:25:46.920 --> 02:25:50.920]  and has since 1988 i mean we're not only seeing it
[02:25:50.920 --> 02:25:54.120]  in the gold and silver market we're seeing it in commodities we're seeing
[02:25:54.120 --> 02:25:58.040]  at the stock market all over the world
[02:25:58.040 --> 02:26:03.880]  and uh this is international fascism is what it is
[02:26:04.280 --> 02:26:09.800]  and they're holding nations hostage saying you will raise taxes you will
[02:26:09.800 --> 02:26:12.600]  give us trillions of dollars globally every month
[02:26:12.600 --> 02:26:16.520]  we won't tell your boondas we won't tell your Reichstag we won't tell your
[02:26:16.520 --> 02:26:19.960]  parliament we won't tell your congress where the money went
[02:26:19.960 --> 02:26:24.040]  how big is this to have Merkel come out and say quote
[02:26:24.040 --> 02:26:27.720]  Goldman Sachs and the banks are treacherous and engineered this i mean
[02:26:27.720 --> 02:26:30.760]  that's a quote and that's right and she's
[02:26:30.760 --> 02:26:33.080]  terrified that they're going to lose the election
[02:26:33.080 --> 02:26:36.840]  uh which i think is tomorrow and north-west ryan westphalia
[02:26:36.840 --> 02:26:41.160]  uh which is northwest germany and uh you know it's
[02:26:41.160 --> 02:26:48.600]  economic survival because she approved uh the german participation in the
[02:26:48.600 --> 02:26:52.440]  bailout and 63 percent of germans were against it
[02:26:52.440 --> 02:26:55.320]  and incidentally from its very inception of the euro
[02:26:55.320 --> 02:26:59.080]  69 percent of men and 71 percent of women have not
[02:26:59.080 --> 02:27:05.000]  wanted the euro in germany and what's what's happened there and if you remember
[02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:08.600]  we talked about this and i brought it up four five months ago
[02:27:08.600 --> 02:27:14.920]  and i said they're going for it and they're going to use grace down the line
[02:27:14.920 --> 02:27:19.800]  uh there's about 19 and total countries that are ready to go under
[02:27:19.800 --> 02:27:22.840]  which gerald just talked about at the end of his conversation
[02:27:22.840 --> 02:27:27.640]  before i get on the air and they wanted to bring them all down together
[02:27:27.640 --> 02:27:33.560]  and devalue and then uh uh uh get rid of the debt between one another
[02:27:33.560 --> 02:27:37.320]  multilaterally and that's not going to happen the way
[02:27:37.320 --> 02:27:40.760]  they wanted it to now what's going to happen is everything's
[02:27:40.760 --> 02:27:45.240]  going to steal uh the greeks stood up on their hind legs and said
[02:27:45.240 --> 02:27:48.680]  hey we're not going to take it anymore and they're
[02:27:48.680 --> 02:27:53.400]  going to keep on demonstrating until the government backs off now
[02:27:53.400 --> 02:27:59.800]  i was interviewed uh on athens international bbc worldwide uh
[02:27:59.800 --> 02:28:04.760]  french worldwide dutch veller three weeks ago and then last week i was on
[02:28:04.760 --> 02:28:09.960]  with the largest newspaper in greece and i they said to me what should we do
[02:28:09.960 --> 02:28:13.080]  and the people don't think they're responsible i said well legally
[02:28:13.080 --> 02:28:16.760]  they are because they put these people in office i said they're gonna have to
[02:28:16.760 --> 02:28:20.120]  work their way through it either that had changed the system
[02:28:20.120 --> 02:28:24.280]  and so if they don't offer a good deal that is the eurozone or the
[02:28:24.280 --> 02:28:30.840]  uh EU then what you do is uh a default of the debt leave the euro and go back
[02:28:30.840 --> 02:28:33.240]  to the drachmer and live happily ever after
[02:28:33.240 --> 02:28:36.840]  use no matter which way you cut it you're going to have a depression
[02:28:36.840 --> 02:28:41.160]  for the next five or ten years so get used to it that is exactly what i told
[02:28:41.160 --> 02:28:45.160]  national greek radio yesterday and a month ago
[02:28:45.160 --> 02:28:49.320]  and the and the greek radio stations i've been on i've been on several
[02:28:49.320 --> 02:28:55.320]  all said that people are aware of this radio show and what we're doing
[02:28:55.320 --> 02:28:59.400]  and what you're doing and that the greek people are actually listening to us
[02:28:59.400 --> 02:29:02.760]  and understand what's happening and they've been told in austerity
[02:29:02.760 --> 02:29:06.280]  you will give us at least half your pension funds just in round one
[02:29:06.280 --> 02:29:11.160]  money they invested and then why are the bankers so arrogant we have uh
[02:29:11.160 --> 02:29:14.120]  the head of the imf in the washington post two weeks ago saying the good times
[02:29:14.120 --> 02:29:17.320]  are over that's a quote we're going to take everything you got why are they so
[02:29:17.320 --> 02:29:21.880]  arrogant and pop and drea was a bill de berger

[02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:34.440]  uh... specifically for those that don't understand and again this has even been
[02:33:34.440 --> 02:33:37.080]  on cnbc but only here in there
[02:33:37.080 --> 02:33:41.080]  the special computer trading programs that only golden sacks and a few other
[02:33:41.080 --> 02:33:42.760]  of the big six banks have
[02:33:42.760 --> 02:33:47.560]  their black boxes that can siphon off billions every week literally theft
[02:33:47.560 --> 02:33:50.760]  uh... they they bring the suckers and they're telling him you know get back
[02:33:50.760 --> 02:33:52.120]  into the market
[02:33:52.120 --> 02:33:55.160]  uh... europe is plunging this is all being uh...
[02:33:55.160 --> 02:33:58.200]  done by design but i agree with you it's getting out of control
[02:33:58.200 --> 02:34:01.960]  in iceland in greece in spain in portugal in england the people are
[02:34:01.960 --> 02:34:03.160]  saying we're not
[02:34:03.160 --> 02:34:06.120]  doing this the americans are behind the curve
[02:34:06.120 --> 02:34:10.520]  in waking up but they're starting to wake up explain to people again what
[02:34:10.520 --> 02:34:14.360]  the president's open market committee is what the plunge protection team is
[02:34:14.360 --> 02:34:18.760]  and the unbelievable power this gives the fractional reserve banking cartel
[02:34:18.760 --> 02:34:22.520]  not only can they create trillions of made-up assets for themselves and
[02:34:22.520 --> 02:34:26.280]  crap derivatives and certify them but they also rig the market
[02:34:26.280 --> 02:34:30.920]  explain how big a deal that is and where gold should really be right now
[02:34:30.920 --> 02:34:33.960]  if they weren't in there trying to suppress it
[02:34:33.960 --> 02:34:39.720]  well first of all uh... the algorithms that are used to go computer programs
[02:34:39.720 --> 02:34:43.320]  and those programs uh... are used in
[02:34:43.320 --> 02:34:48.840]  uh... a combination with the computer in the new york stock exchange
[02:34:48.840 --> 02:34:52.760]  and the closer you are to the nyse computer
[02:34:52.760 --> 02:34:56.360]  uh... the more access and the quicker access that you have
[02:34:56.360 --> 02:35:00.120]  to the orders coming through and they come through in nanoseconds
[02:35:00.120 --> 02:35:04.760]  and so what these characters like oman does and is seventeen of them
[02:35:04.760 --> 02:35:07.640]  so the seventeen computers one after the other lined up
[02:35:07.640 --> 02:35:11.560]  and you pay a certain fee to the stock exchange to go in there
[02:35:11.560 --> 02:35:15.480]  and front-run the orders is actually what they're doing
[02:35:15.480 --> 02:35:20.040]  of course the sec won't tell you that and they won't stop it
[02:35:20.040 --> 02:35:23.400]  because it's a big profit center because they're stealing
[02:35:23.400 --> 02:35:27.320]  from other institutions as well as the public and so
[02:35:27.320 --> 02:35:31.160]  they use these formulas and they go into the computer because they get the
[02:35:31.160 --> 02:35:36.360]  information first and then either buy or sell in relation
[02:35:36.360 --> 02:35:39.880]  to the order that's coming through and they don't make much money
[02:35:39.880 --> 02:35:43.480]  a quarter of a penny a half a penny a penny at the end of the day
[02:35:43.480 --> 02:35:47.240]  it's it's only eight million at the end of the week it's
[02:35:47.240 --> 02:35:52.360]  one billion uh... that they've stolen and so that's what that's all about
[02:35:52.360 --> 02:35:55.000]  and they continue to let it happen just like derivatives
[02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:59.640]  no control i mean the sdc might just as well not even be there
[02:35:59.640 --> 02:36:03.560]  okay and the same thing with the cftc and of course
[02:36:03.560 --> 02:36:07.640]  the cftc all these groups are almost completely
[02:36:07.640 --> 02:36:11.720]  commanded by jp morgan goldman sacks and the other big
[02:36:11.720 --> 02:36:15.640]  four banks alumni but goldman sacks is the key group now
[02:36:15.640 --> 02:36:19.000]  you've worked at all levels of this bob spit i
[02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:22.600]  i know we don't know how they did it but we know it was rigged
[02:36:22.600 --> 02:36:26.280]  and even cnbc is saying that and it wasn't a fat finger
[02:36:26.280 --> 02:36:30.040]  but how i mean we know they read it through the plunge protection team but
[02:36:30.040 --> 02:36:33.720]  we don't know how or maybe you do how were they able and we've
[02:36:33.720 --> 02:36:38.840]  confirmed this to block out ninety plus percent of traders and day traders
[02:36:38.840 --> 02:36:43.000]  and even people on the stock exchange how did they lock it down what was the
[02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:45.960]  mechanism for that ten fifteen minute period
[02:36:45.960 --> 02:36:50.280]  to just lock everybody out and what is their mechanism to go in
[02:36:50.280 --> 02:36:53.880]  specifically what's the instrument through the plunge protection team what
[02:36:53.880 --> 02:36:57.240]  happened yesterday and and if they can
[02:36:57.240 --> 02:37:03.320]  shave points off for themselves uh... at at the source of the river of money
[02:37:03.320 --> 02:37:08.600]  then then is this signaling a new level of insider trading and control when
[02:37:08.600 --> 02:37:12.120]  they just lock the whole stock market down for themselves
[02:37:12.120 --> 02:37:16.600]  well it is a new level and i must admit i cannot describe
[02:37:16.600 --> 02:37:20.200]  how they've done that and i just don't know
[02:37:20.200 --> 02:37:22.920]  and uh... i think the guy who could tell you
[02:37:22.920 --> 02:37:26.120]  is max keiser who has worked on those programs
[02:37:26.120 --> 02:37:30.360]  and he would be the one to be able to describe that let's get keiser on sunday
[02:37:30.360 --> 02:37:33.880]  or monday emergency call to max keiser good point go ahead bob
[02:37:33.880 --> 02:37:38.760]  and uh... so i can't answer the question because my knowledge only goes so far
[02:37:38.760 --> 02:37:43.960]  and and i don't know how they did it and i don't even know who did it
[02:37:43.960 --> 02:37:49.880]  i don't know whether it was government or it was goldman or who it was it was
[02:37:49.880 --> 02:37:53.560]  now how does the plunge protection team work
[02:37:53.560 --> 02:37:57.080]  um... they have people watching the markets they have direction
[02:37:57.080 --> 02:38:00.280]  uh... it's just like uh... the fed and the
[02:38:00.280 --> 02:38:04.120]  and in the treasury uh... tell um...
[02:38:04.120 --> 02:38:07.960]  see this they used to be twenty one is now nineteen
[02:38:07.960 --> 02:38:11.960]  uh... brokerage houses at work with the fed and the treasury
[02:38:11.960 --> 02:38:15.240]  and each morning they have a conference call and they told what to do in the
[02:38:15.240 --> 02:38:20.040]  market uh... you know company a brokerage house a
[02:38:20.040 --> 02:38:23.320]  uh... you go in and you make sure the the price of gold
[02:38:23.320 --> 02:38:27.640]  gets down three dollars today and so it gets down fifteen cents today
[02:38:27.640 --> 02:38:31.400]  uh... brokerage house number two uh... you make sure
[02:38:31.400 --> 02:38:34.520]  uh... that the dow Jones industrial average is up
[02:38:34.520 --> 02:38:38.280]  at least twenty points today uh brokerage house number three
[02:38:38.280 --> 02:38:41.640]  uh... we want you because coppers leading the pack and the
[02:38:41.640 --> 02:38:46.280]  commodity market we want you to knock it down ten or fifteen cents if you can
[02:38:46.280 --> 02:38:50.280]  and they supply the money to do that and that's true that's going on in every
[02:38:50.280 --> 02:38:52.760]  market in the world these people are all professionals
[02:38:52.760 --> 02:38:56.360]  and so they're reading all the markets
[02:38:56.360 --> 02:39:00.520]  and giving themselves an incredible unfair trade
[02:39:00.520 --> 02:39:06.840]  uh... advantage absolutely i mean it is a license to steal people
[02:39:06.840 --> 02:39:10.200]  uh... used to think that the specialist had a license to steal
[02:39:10.200 --> 02:39:15.640]  i mean this is a phenomenal and they're making hundreds of billions of dollars
[02:39:15.640 --> 02:39:19.640]  they're draining all of the pension and profit sharing plans
[02:39:19.640 --> 02:39:24.600]  uh... the people who are managing money at a tremendous disadvantage
[02:39:24.600 --> 02:39:28.200]  uh... and only eight percent of the trades in the new york stock exchange
[02:39:28.200 --> 02:39:32.360]  now are into an individual trading accounts
[02:39:32.360 --> 02:39:37.080]  the seventy three percent of black box these algorithms
[02:39:37.080 --> 02:39:41.400]  and there's no liquidity in the market
[02:39:41.400 --> 02:39:45.560]  but as best you can tell specifically we know they started shutting down the
[02:39:45.560 --> 02:39:50.120]  european stock exchanges right before that they were in freefall
[02:39:50.120 --> 02:39:53.880]  and so to cover positions of the info you have correct me if i'm wrong
[02:39:53.880 --> 02:39:58.600]  is that big outfits dumped a bunch of stock the contagion spread
[02:39:58.600 --> 02:40:02.040]  uh... in the five minutes they weren't watching
[02:40:02.040 --> 02:40:05.560]  it dropped a thousand points the computers kicked in and drove it back up a
[02:40:05.560 --> 02:40:07.240]  thousand
[02:40:07.240 --> 02:40:10.440]  well i don't know about the computer is kicking back in and taking it back up
[02:40:10.440 --> 02:40:13.960]  a thousand i rather suspect the government was behind that when they
[02:40:13.960 --> 02:40:17.480]  started plunging they probably went all out and uh...
[02:40:17.480 --> 02:40:20.840]  about the different derivative contracts to run it back up again
[02:40:20.840 --> 02:40:23.960]  uh... that's what i meant i meant the government computer system because
[02:40:23.960 --> 02:40:28.040]  from what you and others have said that's pretty much pre-programmed
[02:40:28.040 --> 02:40:32.440]  uh... i think that is i think that is and it goes far beyond that
[02:40:32.440 --> 02:40:36.920]  but you know we we we we can accept
[02:40:36.920 --> 02:40:41.720]  the fact that they should be some sort of method
[02:40:41.720 --> 02:40:46.200]  of keeping the market from plunging a thousand points of the day
[02:40:46.200 --> 02:40:51.320]  and uh... and uh... a a uh... working group of financial markets plunged
[02:40:51.320 --> 02:40:54.520]  particular protection team could do something like that
[02:40:54.520 --> 02:40:59.160]  but not what they're doing they are raping
[02:40:59.160 --> 02:41:03.400]  and that's not what this was designed for and it's got to stop
[02:41:03.400 --> 02:41:06.680]  the executive order has to be killed in fact
[02:41:06.680 --> 02:41:09.480]  i think there should be no executive orders
[02:41:09.480 --> 02:41:12.040]  all right bob i don't think they should be lobbying
[02:41:12.040 --> 02:41:15.800]  our campaign contributions are patria act one and two
[02:41:15.800 --> 02:41:19.400]  and the fed reserve and i can go on and on all right bob chatman's gonna be with

[02:41:41.160 --> 02:41:46.040]  four hundred five hundred uh... and uh...
[02:41:46.040 --> 02:41:50.760]  i haven't sold any of it i personally didn't buy it as an investment i bought
[02:41:50.760 --> 02:41:55.320]  it as an as an emergency backup and i've still bought some since it went
[02:41:55.320 --> 02:41:59.640]  above a thousand uh... but every analyst we have on says it
[02:41:59.640 --> 02:42:03.640]  should be above two thousand two thousand five hundred it's now come out with
[02:42:03.640 --> 02:42:08.760]  the goldman sacks uh... jp morgan whistleblowers that they are suppressing
[02:42:08.760 --> 02:42:11.800]  that the gata lawsuits are correct it's that uh... that's been in
[02:42:11.800 --> 02:42:16.440]  uh... testimony now on c span so all of this is starting to come out
[02:42:16.440 --> 02:42:19.080]  uh... we know they're trying to hold gold down but they can't it's up over
[02:42:19.080 --> 02:42:20.440]  thirty five dollars
[02:42:20.440 --> 02:42:23.720]  on the last two days to uh... one thousand two hundred
[02:42:23.720 --> 02:42:27.000]  nine dollars and eighty cents so one thousand two hundred nine dollars and
[02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:29.640]  eighty cents uh... right now silver
[02:42:29.640 --> 02:42:35.160]  uh... is way up what do you see happening in the gold and silver market
[02:42:35.160 --> 02:42:38.520]  are you asking me alexis i'm asking bob we're going to you tell me to get your
[02:42:38.520 --> 02:42:40.520]  take two
[02:42:40.520 --> 02:42:44.440]  uh... usually uh... she's the best analyst in the world right now
[02:42:44.440 --> 02:42:47.880]  and uh... she said that we're going to break out to a new high
[02:42:47.880 --> 02:42:50.840]  will go to a thirteen to fifteen hundred and then we're going to go up from
[02:42:50.840 --> 02:42:51.800]  there
[02:42:51.800 --> 02:42:55.480]  she says this is a super bull market i agree with her and that's where we're
[02:42:55.480 --> 02:42:56.360]  going
[02:42:56.360 --> 02:42:59.640]  now and let and let's be clear uh... ted anderson
[02:42:59.640 --> 02:43:03.000]  and uh... i haven't seen these numbers the last hour but
[02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:06.520]  uh... if people think gold is way up here in the united states they haven't
[02:43:06.520 --> 02:43:08.920]  even looked at europe or asia
[02:43:08.920 --> 02:43:13.400]  europe and asia right now seeing gold at the peaks that they've never seen before
[02:43:13.400 --> 02:43:17.640]  i mean yesterday we had a run out of the european currencies into u.s. treasuries
[02:43:17.640 --> 02:43:20.680]  and gold both of those hand in hand so gold is up
[02:43:20.680 --> 02:43:25.640]  and so was the dollar now today gold is up over fifteen dollars since i talked to
[02:43:25.640 --> 02:43:27.160]  yesterday on the air
[02:43:27.160 --> 02:43:31.480]  and the uh... u.s. dollars now falling so obviously the run the treasuries is
[02:43:31.480 --> 02:43:32.200]  stopped
[02:43:32.200 --> 02:43:35.800]  and now they're running in a gold specifically because everything's down i
[02:43:35.800 --> 02:43:37.320]  mean you look at the indexes
[02:43:37.320 --> 02:43:40.600]  across the board the rustle the dollar everything everything's down
[02:43:40.600 --> 02:43:41.560]  it's in the red
[02:43:41.560 --> 02:43:44.360]  but gold is up and silver's up right now bob
[02:43:44.360 --> 02:43:47.160]  chatman and then ted explain that in layman's terms
[02:43:47.160 --> 02:43:50.760]  normally the globalist can balance things they drive one thing down
[02:43:50.760 --> 02:43:52.440]  they jack something else up
[02:43:52.440 --> 02:43:53.640]  but now
[02:43:53.640 --> 02:43:55.720]  uh... we see this
[02:43:55.720 --> 02:43:58.280]  this gyration accelerating
[02:43:58.280 --> 02:44:01.240]  and it's a coordinated global
[02:44:01.240 --> 02:44:04.600]  uh... downfall is it not
[02:44:04.600 --> 02:44:07.720]  well i think it is but i think it's gone out of control
[02:44:07.720 --> 02:44:11.720]  and they are no longer able to control in totality
[02:44:11.720 --> 02:44:13.400]  the golden server market
[02:44:13.400 --> 02:44:16.680]  all i can do is influence it for two or three days at a time
[02:44:16.680 --> 02:44:19.800]  and that's allowed me because of my recognition of that
[02:44:19.800 --> 02:44:21.160]  to be so right
[02:44:21.160 --> 02:44:24.840]  i don't encourage trading but we had a trade by what i've said
[02:44:24.840 --> 02:44:27.000]  uh... for months and months day to day
[02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:29.080]  uh... you would have done very very well
[02:44:29.080 --> 02:44:31.080]  and uh... but
[02:44:31.080 --> 02:44:32.600]  normally
[02:44:32.600 --> 02:44:35.160]  uh... gold and silver don't go up
[02:44:35.160 --> 02:44:37.640]  when the dollar's going up
[02:44:37.640 --> 02:44:40.840]  but i said a year ago if you remember
[02:44:40.840 --> 02:44:44.040]  that the dollar had decoupled from gold it was on its own
[02:44:44.040 --> 02:44:46.360]  it is another currency
[02:44:46.360 --> 02:44:48.680]  and that's what it's been for six thousand years
[02:44:48.680 --> 02:44:51.400]  well bob that's one of the twitter questions i want to get uh... ten
[02:44:51.400 --> 02:44:54.280]  Anderson's take on this is also an expert on these issues
[02:44:54.280 --> 02:44:56.840]  uh... with a great track record of predictions
[02:44:56.840 --> 02:45:00.520]  uh... looking at this normally when
[02:45:00.520 --> 02:45:04.200]  the dollars going up as you said gold goes down now you had the dollar going
[02:45:04.200 --> 02:45:06.200]  up in the last few days now it's going down
[02:45:06.200 --> 02:45:08.360]  and gold still going up but separately
[02:45:08.360 --> 02:45:12.120]  crude going way down and gold going way up so
[02:45:12.120 --> 02:45:16.040]  all the normal rules are now upside down just like the summer
[02:45:16.040 --> 02:45:18.440]  going back i've looked at over the last hundred years
[02:45:18.440 --> 02:45:22.840]  is almost always a bad time for metals here we are starting the summer
[02:45:22.840 --> 02:45:26.440]  and gold and silver got a rocket tied to their back
[02:45:26.440 --> 02:45:28.520]  i'll add to that one right now it
[02:45:28.520 --> 02:45:33.080]  it is six thousand years ago when the kings are being buried in the egyptian
[02:45:33.080 --> 02:45:36.440]  tombs they're putting gold in there because gold was money
[02:45:36.440 --> 02:45:40.120]  paper currencies like this fiat system that we have right now developed from
[02:45:40.120 --> 02:45:44.280]  gold and they were just certificates of deposit that were being traded amongst
[02:45:44.280 --> 02:45:48.280]  uh... amongst merchants uh... now we're sitting in this position where gold
[02:45:48.280 --> 02:45:51.640]  has been broken away completely from paper currencies
[02:45:51.640 --> 02:45:54.360]  and uh... and the reason for having gold as money
[02:45:54.360 --> 02:45:58.360]  has been forgotten until now now you have europeans
[02:45:58.360 --> 02:46:02.120]  uh... asians people in the united states south america
[02:46:02.120 --> 02:46:05.160]  africa you name it they're going to go for money
[02:46:05.160 --> 02:46:08.440]  they're not going to go because they're looking to speculate or anything else
[02:46:08.440 --> 02:46:12.280]  they're going to go because they know gold is money and it'll hold value
[02:46:12.280 --> 02:46:15.560]  and it doesn't have to be tied to what the politicians are doing because they're
[02:46:15.560 --> 02:46:19.000]  destroying our world and so are the banks
[02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:23.800]  and gold is separate from all that it's like the ultimate safety hedge
[02:46:23.800 --> 02:46:27.480]  well you know we told people buy gold when it was 300 when it was 500 when it
[02:46:27.480 --> 02:46:30.840]  was a thousand and uh... chad bought a bunch of
[02:46:30.840 --> 02:46:34.360]  gold and silver in the last month when it was a lot less he can still
[02:46:34.360 --> 02:46:37.960]  pass on the savings of the lower prices of gold and silver
[02:46:37.960 --> 02:46:41.720]  it's it's like you have a time machine and can go back in time
[02:46:41.720 --> 02:46:45.960]  uh... and uh... get a better deal on gold and silver i hope people take
[02:46:45.960 --> 02:46:49.160]  advantage of it and then we're going to get into phone calls and talk about
[02:46:49.160 --> 02:46:53.080]  pension funds and where bob sees this global economic meltdown going but
[02:46:53.080 --> 02:46:56.600]  uh... ted anderson uh... tell people about the mightest resources gold and
[02:46:56.600 --> 02:47:00.200]  silver offer of today the offer of today is uh...
[02:47:00.200 --> 02:47:03.880]  frank said two fifty four sixty eight which is the same price i offered for
[02:47:03.880 --> 02:47:08.280]  them uh... yesterday now gold's run up fifteen bucks since i made that offer
[02:47:08.280 --> 02:47:11.240]  since yesterday so you can kind of get an idea where that's going
[02:47:11.240 --> 02:47:15.240]  because this is a fifth of an ounce of gold you have a fifteen dollar increase
[02:47:15.240 --> 02:47:18.920]  you can do the math this coin has gone up in price on the wholesale market
[02:47:18.920 --> 02:47:23.160]  when i run out of inventory it'll be up on my retail prices as well
[02:47:23.160 --> 02:47:26.920]  but right now if you buy just one coin you can get bob's international
[02:47:26.920 --> 02:47:30.760]  forecaster and i don't know if i can give you anything more valuable than that
[02:47:30.760 --> 02:47:34.920]  because right now information is the key people are sitting here scratching
[02:47:34.920 --> 02:47:38.600]  their head wondering what to do well i can tell you when the whole world
[02:47:38.600 --> 02:47:41.640]  is running away from the united states dollar in the euro
[02:47:41.640 --> 02:47:44.600]  and all the difference of currencies across the globe
[02:47:44.600 --> 02:47:48.520]  and they're going to gold you better pay attention because there's problems out
[02:47:48.520 --> 02:47:51.720]  there the problems are are bigger than we can solve
[02:47:51.720 --> 02:47:56.440]  and we're gonna have big big drops in the value of our currency
[02:47:56.440 --> 02:48:01.560]  absolutely quantify uh... that fifth of an ounce european frank
[02:48:01.560 --> 02:48:07.320]  free year uh... digital or hard copy international forecaster deal quantify
[02:48:07.320 --> 02:48:10.360]  that for people well i mean let's just take a look at it i mean at two hundred
[02:48:10.360 --> 02:48:13.800]  and fifty four dollars an ounce i mean by the time you do the math you're paying
[02:48:13.800 --> 02:48:17.480]  about five hundred dollars an ounce for gold because you're getting a free
[02:48:17.480 --> 02:48:21.720]  subscription which is worth a hundred and fifty nine dollars in my opinion
[02:48:21.720 --> 02:48:25.480]  steeply discounted at that price should be closer to eight hundred dollars for a
[02:48:25.480 --> 02:48:28.840]  year but that's just that you know that's just the market for newsletters
[02:48:28.840 --> 02:48:32.440]  i'm just telling you right now that coin is
[02:48:32.440 --> 02:48:37.720]  due to rise from two fifty four to about two hundred and sixty six dollars a piece
[02:48:37.720 --> 02:48:41.800]  just because of what gold has done today when you top that off with a hundred
[02:48:41.800 --> 02:48:45.240]  fifty nine dollar subscription i don't know how i can make that better for you
[02:48:45.240 --> 02:48:48.840]  plus also alex silver ran up a dollar since yesterday
[02:48:48.840 --> 02:48:53.160]  and right now we have the same silver walking liberty halves at nine seventy
[02:48:53.160 --> 02:48:58.040]  five another great buy if you're looking for junk silver or you'll want eagles or
[02:48:58.040 --> 02:49:01.160]  maple leaves i mean i don't care what it is that you want in gold and silver at
[02:49:01.160 --> 02:49:03.800]  this point in time my suggestion is that you get
[02:49:03.800 --> 02:49:06.920]  moving and you get moving now don't wait till later because
[02:49:06.920 --> 02:49:09.880]  here we are sitting in the summer the fall is always the best time of the
[02:49:09.880 --> 02:49:13.320]  year for gold and silver people are more concerned about vacations than there
[02:49:13.320 --> 02:49:17.800]  are about their economic condition and and for some reason the fall has always
[02:49:17.800 --> 02:49:20.680]  been hot for gold and silver and here we're seeing it in the summer
[02:49:20.680 --> 02:49:24.840]  we had this happen remember back when uh when bush was leaving office and
[02:49:24.840 --> 02:49:27.240]  paulson was saying that we had to bail out the world
[02:49:27.240 --> 02:49:31.160]  and we're looking at um marshal law if they don't do it
[02:49:31.160 --> 02:49:34.600]  i mean at that point in time we had a hot summer for gold the fall was almost
[02:49:34.600 --> 02:49:36.920]  twice as hot and here we're sitting in the same
[02:49:36.920 --> 02:49:40.440]  position at that time precious metals dealers are putting limits on what
[02:49:40.440 --> 02:49:43.720]  people absolutely folks and again you've got to tell them it's the alex
[02:49:43.720 --> 02:49:48.680]  jones special to take advantage of this this is a wonderful deal i think
[02:49:48.680 --> 02:49:51.640]  people should get involved in it i mean i certainly believe in it this is what i
[02:49:51.640 --> 02:49:56.040]  personally have done eight hundred six eight six two two three seven eight

[02:50:16.920 --> 02:50:21.640]  jones sends you the current prices ted has got it is very very competitive but
[02:50:21.640 --> 02:50:26.440]  he does this special for my radio audience here's the number eight hundred

[02:54:23.880 --> 02:54:27.080]  yesterday with that thousand point plunge and then it going right back up
[02:54:27.080 --> 02:54:30.280]  again uh let's talk to chris in road island you're on the air with bob
[02:54:30.280 --> 02:54:34.520]  shatman go ahead how are you guys doing today pretty good go ahead
[02:54:34.520 --> 02:54:39.720]  um quick question um is there any way that the general public can check put
[02:54:39.720 --> 02:54:43.480]  options on the dow Jones that happened yesterday
[02:54:43.480 --> 02:54:47.240]  because we know the sec doesn't really follow up on things like that
[02:54:47.240 --> 02:54:51.080]  like we saw after 9-11 that's a great question we had record put options on
[02:54:51.080 --> 02:54:55.480]  airlines betting against them just on american and united in the four days
[02:54:55.480 --> 02:54:58.520]  before 9-11 and that did come out in the german and british papers
[02:54:58.520 --> 02:55:02.520]  that it led back to buzzy cron guard executive director of the cia bob
[02:55:02.520 --> 02:55:08.200]  shatman right and uh that information is probably
[02:55:08.200 --> 02:55:11.880]  available but i haven't been directly involved in the brokerage
[02:55:11.880 --> 02:55:17.160]  business for 20 years or more and so i can't tell you how to get it
[02:55:17.160 --> 02:55:21.480]  but there are services out there that have it the problem is is it accurate
[02:55:21.480 --> 02:55:26.040]  information i would think it would be accurate
[02:55:26.040 --> 02:55:29.560]  so that's something to identify who the sellers uh who the buyers of the puts
[02:55:29.560 --> 02:55:32.280]  were uh because that's house to house and then to
[02:55:32.280 --> 02:55:38.280]  a personal account of some kind uh but it can show you the volume by house
[02:55:38.280 --> 02:55:41.640]  i wonder how the german papers found out it was uh
[02:55:41.640 --> 02:55:48.200]  buzzy cron guard in 2001 probably by their intelligence uh
[02:55:48.200 --> 02:55:52.840]  operations uh working with the american intel
[02:55:52.840 --> 02:55:56.040]  uh gave them the information i would think that's how they got it well i'll
[02:55:56.040 --> 02:55:59.720]  say this chris that's a great question why isn't the mainstream media
[02:55:59.720 --> 02:56:02.760]  fact well before we accuse them of it let's google it
[02:56:02.760 --> 02:56:06.840]  google under google news um which will do a news search
[02:56:06.840 --> 02:56:11.640]  uh put options against the market
[02:56:12.920 --> 02:56:17.240]  for market plunge or something like that let's find out anything else chris
[02:56:17.240 --> 02:56:20.680]  he dropped off okay pastor in ohio you're on the air
[02:56:20.680 --> 02:56:27.320]  uh yes i'm uh bob uh bob my question is this uh yesterday with that stock
[02:56:27.320 --> 02:56:30.600]  market going doing what it was doing well then
[02:56:30.600 --> 02:56:36.360]  we've had this uh prediction made back so shoot since the first year that
[02:56:36.360 --> 02:56:39.560]  something was going to happen on may the sixth anyway
[02:56:39.560 --> 02:56:42.520]  but then on top of all that i was listening to another
[02:56:42.520 --> 02:56:45.480]  man that it was talking on the on the internet
[02:56:45.480 --> 02:56:50.600]  is talking about the the marshal law false flag that they did yesterday
[02:56:50.600 --> 02:56:54.440]  um that they was waiting till after six o'clock
[02:56:54.440 --> 02:56:57.240]  uh eastern standard time for them to let them know whether it was going to be a
[02:56:57.240 --> 02:57:01.960]  marshal law action or uh or a stand down do you see
[02:57:01.960 --> 02:57:05.960]  the all that coming to let me just stop and then get bob's answer
[02:57:05.960 --> 02:57:09.640]  i do remember people saying something was going to happen may six the marshal law
[02:57:09.640 --> 02:57:13.080]  and i just ignore that that type of stuff usually bob what
[02:57:13.080 --> 02:57:17.560]  what's your take on that well i saw the same thing you did and ignored it for
[02:57:17.560 --> 02:57:21.640]  the same reason and uh maybe somebody had some
[02:57:21.640 --> 02:57:24.680]  information that this had been set up ahead of time
[02:57:24.680 --> 02:57:28.760]  it's hard to tell well we know they had in leo 10
[02:57:28.760 --> 02:57:32.360]  with simulated nuke attacks set to start on may sixth
[02:57:32.360 --> 02:57:35.720]  and that came out mainstream news but then they quote cancelled it
[02:57:35.720 --> 02:57:39.480]  it is suspicious that i hadn't thought of that great point pastor
[02:57:39.480 --> 02:57:44.120]  i hadn't thought of of uh it's it's too incredible bob
[02:57:44.120 --> 02:57:50.360]  it is and uh you know uh our problem is that we gotta back into everything
[02:57:50.360 --> 02:57:54.920]  and we have nothing at a disposal i mean we have to use our ingenuity and
[02:57:54.920 --> 02:58:00.200]  and it's hard to cover everything pastor great uh point anything else
[02:58:00.200 --> 02:58:06.600]  yes uh that's why alex you you and steve quell and people like you guys
[02:58:06.600 --> 02:58:10.840]  that the one you had on there yesterday red i believe it's his name red back
[02:58:10.840 --> 02:58:14.840]  one yeah that's why you guys are so important
[02:58:14.840 --> 02:58:20.680]  because you help for everyone else get involved and you got more eyes
[02:58:20.680 --> 02:58:26.680]  seeing things that you can't see so my whole thing is is just
[02:58:26.680 --> 02:58:31.000]  hang in there and just keep putting your face and trust in the lord and just

[03:01:26.280 --> 03:01:30.520]  what amounts to a congressional clean sweep because i have more than a little
[03:01:30.520 --> 03:01:34.360]  experience both in finance and in politics
[03:01:34.360 --> 03:01:38.520]  uh... i certified the american uh... stock exchange
[03:01:38.520 --> 03:01:43.000]  and the n-a-s-d trading computers uh... because i was both a principal

[03:01:47.720 --> 03:01:51.720]  i resigned my licenses for two specific congressional acts one
[03:01:51.720 --> 03:01:55.640]  was the revocation of glass steel and the other was the authorization of the
[03:01:55.640 --> 03:02:00.200]  trading department to make secret transactions of any volume whatsoever
[03:02:00.200 --> 03:02:04.120]  uh... under those conditions i was satisfied to this is twenty years ago
[03:02:04.120 --> 03:02:07.320]  more or less i was satisfied that the american stock
[03:02:07.320 --> 03:02:11.080]  market is absolutely rigged from beginning to end
[03:02:11.080 --> 03:02:14.280]  and that the only alternative to that was to get
[03:02:14.280 --> 03:02:17.880]  a clean sweep in congress i have done uh... work

[03:03:11.720 --> 03:03:15.400]  i just flabbergasted when in passing i happen to mention
[03:03:15.400 --> 03:03:19.000]  that uh... the uh... uh... the american government had a
[03:03:19.000 --> 03:03:23.080]  a new policy of assassinating americans the campaign manager
[03:03:23.080 --> 03:03:27.800]  for a one of these candidates didn't ask me what my evidence was he
[03:03:27.800 --> 03:03:32.440]  see he said flat out that's a lot and i said no it isn't and i will
[03:03:32.440 --> 03:03:36.440]  uh... be happy to put together no that was in a p and u p i that they will
[03:03:36.440 --> 03:03:39.080]  assassinate americans they believe are tied to terror and they're saying they're
[03:03:39.080 --> 03:03:42.920]  gonna arrest americans they have bills introduced without due process if they
[03:03:42.920 --> 03:03:45.800]  claim they think you might be a terrorist and strip you of your
[03:03:45.800 --> 03:03:49.240]  constitutional rights that's true and i said i said i'll put
[03:03:49.240 --> 03:03:52.200]  together a half a dozen of these film clips for you which i did
[03:03:52.200 --> 03:03:55.640]  i called him back gave him the link to my server
[03:03:55.640 --> 03:03:58.920]  again i provide all these services to politicians for free
[03:03:58.920 --> 03:04:02.280]  and i gave him the link to my server to these these half a dozen
[03:04:02.280 --> 03:04:06.760]  video clips of this to this day he has never logged on to that
[03:04:06.760 --> 03:04:10.600]  uh... to that link let me raise this point and then come back and get bob's
[03:04:10.600 --> 03:04:14.920]  take on it now when you look at all the major finance ministers in
[03:04:14.920 --> 03:04:18.040]  major nations you look at local mayors city managers
[03:04:18.040 --> 03:04:22.120]  they're all run by the big banks bob Chapman

[03:06:00.600 --> 03:06:06.400]  In March, Alex Jones announced that eFoodsDirect was putting together a high-volume, pre-production
[03:06:06.400 --> 03:06:08.600]  order of the new Quick Fix Meals.
[03:06:08.600 --> 03:06:12.740]  By waiting for production and shipping of their orders, families were able to receive
[03:06:12.740 --> 03:06:16.080]  one free item for every three that they bought.
[03:06:16.080 --> 03:06:19.820]  Once the final shutdown of this buy three get one free program, we've had a lot of
[03:06:19.820 --> 03:06:22.960]  folks calling, disappointed that they missed the order deadline.
[03:06:22.960 --> 03:06:24.440]  Listen carefully.
[03:06:24.440 --> 03:06:29.320]  Starting immediately, eFoodsDirect.com will take pre-production orders for a buy three
[03:06:29.320 --> 03:06:33.920]  get one free program for one week ending May 14th at midnight.
[03:06:33.920 --> 03:06:38.240]  You will receive one free item for every three that you order of the selected products.
[03:06:38.240 --> 03:06:41.120]  These orders will begin shipping the first week of June.

[03:06:48.000 --> 03:06:53.680]  That's eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex, 800-409-5633.
[03:06:53.680 --> 03:07:00.320]  Again, that's eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex, 800-409-5633.
[03:07:00.320 --> 03:07:01.680]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:07:01.680 --> 03:07:05.680]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage
[03:07:05.680 --> 03:07:07.280]  vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[03:07:07.280 --> 03:07:11.080]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than seeds
[03:07:11.080 --> 03:07:12.080]  silver or gold?
[03:07:12.080 --> 03:07:13.080]  It's true.
[03:07:13.080 --> 03:07:16.240]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible
[03:07:16.240 --> 03:07:17.880]  that could even happen again.
[03:07:17.880 --> 03:07:22.040]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[03:07:22.040 --> 03:07:23.040]  seeds.
[03:07:23.040 --> 03:07:28.360]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense
[03:07:28.360 --> 03:07:30.200]  food for you and your family.
[03:07:30.200 --> 03:07:31.320]  And here's the best part.
[03:07:31.320 --> 03:07:35.520]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds
[03:07:35.520 --> 03:07:38.000]  to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[03:07:38.000 --> 03:07:41.280]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[03:07:41.280 --> 03:07:48.080]  That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[03:07:48.080 --> 03:07:52.560]  That's 877-327-0365.
[03:07:52.560 --> 03:07:57.080]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[03:07:57.080 --> 03:08:01.480]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[03:08:01.480 --> 03:08:07.400]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show because there's
[03:08:07.400 --> 03:08:09.400]  a war on for your mind.
[03:08:09.400 --> 03:08:15.320]  Okay, I'm going to rattle through your phone calls, your questions for Bob Chapman on what's
[03:08:15.320 --> 03:08:18.960]  happening with the global economic meltdown, what happened with a thousand point plunge,
[03:08:18.960 --> 03:08:24.400]  and then it going right back up with the plunge protection team run by the federal government
[03:08:24.400 --> 03:08:26.520]  manipulating the market.
[03:08:26.520 --> 03:08:29.720]  We're going to discuss this all with Bob Chapman right now.
[03:08:29.720 --> 03:08:31.720]  He's with us for the bottom of the hour.
[03:08:31.720 --> 03:08:34.400]  Then I'm going to continue with your phone calls about what happened yesterday and get
[03:08:34.400 --> 03:08:38.840]  into some other very important police state news.
[03:08:38.840 --> 03:08:44.800]  We have footage of a SWAT team up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com with my commentary going
[03:08:44.800 --> 03:08:49.720]  into a house over a gram, that's less than a joint of marijuana, killing both their dogs,
[03:08:49.720 --> 03:08:54.320]  including a Welsh corgi, pointing guns at little kids, and then sending the CPS to try
[03:08:54.320 --> 03:08:56.760]  to take the kids because they had marijuana.
[03:08:56.760 --> 03:09:01.040]  Meanwhile, we have the Fox News clip in the clip where they admit our government's growing
[03:09:01.040 --> 03:09:03.240]  the opium in Afghanistan.
[03:09:03.240 --> 03:09:08.040]  Now, they've been caught flying cocaine in, congressional hearings in the 70s, and in
[03:09:08.040 --> 03:09:13.240]  96 admitted, the CIA ships a lot of the narcotics in, the big banks launder it.
[03:09:13.240 --> 03:09:17.840]  By keeping drugs illegal, that keeps the price high, which the banks can then launder.
[03:09:17.840 --> 03:09:24.080]  But Bob Chapman, it's been in foreign newspapers that our government has more than, what, it's
[03:09:24.080 --> 03:09:29.840]  12 times plus a year ago, the amount of opium being produced pre-2001 in Afghanistan.
[03:09:29.840 --> 03:09:35.320]  But now to put marine commanders on Fox News to say, yes, we help them grow it.
[03:09:35.320 --> 03:09:37.960]  If we don't, Al Qaeda will sell it and make money.
[03:09:37.960 --> 03:09:43.500]  So we've got to sell it because they'll sell it if we don't know, you decriminalize it.
[03:09:43.500 --> 03:09:46.140]  But this is how they corrupt the troops in Vietnam.
[03:09:46.140 --> 03:09:49.400]  It's how they corrupted them in World War II for narcotics.
[03:09:49.400 --> 03:09:52.560]  You worked in military intelligence before you became one of the biggest gold and silver
[03:09:52.560 --> 03:09:56.640]  traders out there, before you started your top newsletter, the international forecaster
[03:09:56.640 --> 03:09:58.480]  and the ones that were before that.
[03:09:58.480 --> 03:10:03.800]  But what can you say about government narcotics trafficking and the fact that they are openly
[03:10:03.800 --> 03:10:08.320]  admitting now they're shipping the drugs in, but then when you're caught with marijuana,
[03:10:08.320 --> 03:10:11.040]  we're going to kill your dog and take your kids.
[03:10:11.040 --> 03:10:19.760]  Well, the OSS got involved with MI6 in the late 1930s in the opium trade.
[03:10:19.760 --> 03:10:27.440]  Prior to that, the privateers were running opium from India to China.
[03:10:27.440 --> 03:10:30.680]  On behalf of the British royal family.
[03:10:30.680 --> 03:10:40.080]  And so America has been directly involved in the process of distributing narcotics,
[03:10:40.080 --> 03:10:45.160]  which happens to be the most lucrative trade in the entire world.
[03:10:45.160 --> 03:10:52.320]  And almost every fortune of the royal families of Europe was made from the narcotics business.
[03:10:52.320 --> 03:11:02.520]  I've interviewed about 15 almost all Marines in Afghanistan who told me they were guarding
[03:11:02.520 --> 03:11:03.520]  the opium poppies.
[03:11:03.520 --> 03:11:05.120]  That was their job.
[03:11:05.120 --> 03:11:09.880]  And so what the colonel has said is absolutely true.
[03:11:09.880 --> 03:11:14.240]  And they're going to continue to do it and they're producing 93% of the world's opium
[03:11:14.240 --> 03:11:19.560]  right now and all the largest crop of marijuana in the world.
[03:11:19.560 --> 03:11:25.000]  And the first place they flood is Europe and of course the Russians are furious about it.
[03:11:25.000 --> 03:11:26.600]  And yeah, that's in Reuters.
[03:11:26.600 --> 03:11:31.960]  They're saying spray the poppies and our own government NATO says no, we're growing it.
[03:11:31.960 --> 03:11:37.480]  And they put Marines on TV with Geraldo telling us it's good that our government grows it
[03:11:37.480 --> 03:11:38.920]  and ships it out.
[03:11:38.920 --> 03:11:43.720]  But then the cops go in and kill people's dogs and laugh at them over a gram of marijuana
[03:11:43.720 --> 03:11:46.360]  in front of little kids in a middle class home.
[03:11:46.360 --> 03:11:47.520]  It's so elementary.
[03:11:47.520 --> 03:11:53.240]  They ship it in as a pretext to enslave us and put us in prison and control our lives
[03:11:53.240 --> 03:11:57.280]  and to put us in their private prisons owned by big banks that launder the money.
[03:11:57.280 --> 03:11:59.640]  I mean, this is disgusting.
[03:11:59.640 --> 03:12:02.040]  And I've got a key video up on info wars.com.
[03:12:02.040 --> 03:12:07.600]  I'm asking listeners to make a mega viral government admits they deal heroin yet terrorize
[03:12:07.600 --> 03:12:09.760]  families for pot.
[03:12:09.760 --> 03:12:16.640]  This 10 minute video, it is just so disgusting to see this Bob and look at Mexico collapsing
[03:12:16.640 --> 03:12:20.720]  from their phony drug war where the US government, the Mexican government are admittedly trying
[03:12:20.720 --> 03:12:22.920]  to knock out their competition down there.
[03:12:22.920 --> 03:12:24.200]  That's all this is.
[03:12:24.200 --> 03:12:27.200]  And it threatens to collapse our Southwestern states.
[03:12:27.200 --> 03:12:29.840]  So it'll be correct.
[03:12:29.840 --> 03:12:30.840]  And you get it nailed.
[03:12:30.840 --> 03:12:35.280]  It's a fight to take over the drug business by the CIA and the Mexican government.
[03:12:35.280 --> 03:12:37.600]  And it's absolutely no question.
[03:12:37.600 --> 03:12:40.120]  And the wealthy Mexicans look the other way.
[03:12:40.120 --> 03:12:43.160]  And the average Mexican, what's he going to do?
[03:12:43.160 --> 03:12:48.080]  And you know, they're fighting with these groups and the groups are fighting among each other.
[03:12:48.080 --> 03:12:52.840]  And for, you know, pathways into the United States and things like this.
[03:12:52.840 --> 03:13:00.000]  And of course, the solution is Americans stop using drugs, but that's not going to happen.
[03:13:00.000 --> 03:13:07.280]  And so the transportation of narcotics into the United States from South and Central America
[03:13:07.280 --> 03:13:09.960]  and through Mexico is going to continue.
[03:13:09.960 --> 03:13:14.120]  But folks, think of the magnitude, put two and two together.
[03:13:14.120 --> 03:13:15.880]  Because they can't hide it anymore.
[03:13:15.880 --> 03:13:19.000]  They admit they're producing the cocaine and heroin.
[03:13:19.000 --> 03:13:20.760]  They're shipping it in.
[03:13:20.760 --> 03:13:27.000]  But then cops risk their lives in drug raids and are so busy not going after big dealers
[03:13:27.000 --> 03:13:32.080]  that have paid off their bosses that they're raiding people for one joint and now sending
[03:13:32.080 --> 03:13:37.280]  CPS to take people's children if they're caught with marijuana for child endangerment.
[03:13:37.280 --> 03:13:43.520]  I mean, this is so outrageously in our face, it shows just how criminal this government
[03:13:43.520 --> 03:13:45.120]  and its enforcers are.
[03:13:45.120 --> 03:13:46.920]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[03:13:46.920 --> 03:13:50.280]  I've talked to so many cops and they say, yeah, we know the government ships most of
[03:13:50.280 --> 03:13:54.560]  it in, but you know, this is our business and we get money off the seizures.
[03:13:54.560 --> 03:13:55.960]  And so we're going to do this.
[03:13:55.960 --> 03:14:02.480]  If you decriminalize it, not legalize, decriminalize all the money goes out of it.
[03:14:02.480 --> 03:14:06.640]  I mean, Skull and Bones was founded for drug dealing at Yale.
[03:14:06.640 --> 03:14:12.600]  I mean, our whole CIA was set up for drug dealing and watch them do this to their family.
[03:14:12.600 --> 03:14:16.160]  And those cops know full well the government shipping all that stuff in, Bob, it tears
[03:14:16.160 --> 03:14:17.160]  my guts out.
[03:14:17.160 --> 03:14:19.320]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[03:14:19.320 --> 03:14:21.640]  And they've known for a long, long time.
[03:14:21.640 --> 03:14:25.840]  I mean, we can go back to Air America during the Vietnam War.
[03:14:25.840 --> 03:14:30.520]  You know, anybody who knew anything about anything knew that the drugs are coming in
[03:14:30.520 --> 03:14:32.960]  from Southeast Asia from the CIA.
[03:14:32.960 --> 03:14:33.960]  Okay.
[03:14:33.960 --> 03:14:34.960]  Shifting gears.
[03:14:34.960 --> 03:14:38.800]  There's a Twitter question here from info assurance one.
[03:14:38.800 --> 03:14:42.760]  Should we be pulling our money out of 401ks completely of the dollar collapses?
[03:14:42.760 --> 03:14:43.760]  What does it matter?
[03:14:43.760 --> 03:14:49.040]  And I want to dovetail that with Bloomberg and others, more and more articles.
[03:14:49.040 --> 03:14:53.560]  When you hear austerity, folks, what they've told Greece is they want half of people's
[03:14:53.560 --> 03:14:57.280]  401ks and their pensions to pay the banks.
[03:14:57.280 --> 03:15:02.240]  The people don't even know the money, Merkel, the German president is saying blast treacherous
[03:15:02.240 --> 03:15:05.400]  banks in Greece says it's all rigged.
[03:15:05.400 --> 03:15:11.880]  So the president of Germany is now, or the chancellor of Germany is now saying this.
[03:15:11.880 --> 03:15:17.880]  What can you say to people about the plan to get the pension funds?
[03:15:17.880 --> 03:15:22.960]  We know they've had hearings and we, of course, we're not invited.
[03:15:22.960 --> 03:15:29.960]  And the government's got to decide if anything, what they're going to do for the time being,
[03:15:29.960 --> 03:15:31.960]  they may not do anything.
[03:15:31.960 --> 03:15:36.680]  What I've instructed subscribers to do is wait and see if the government's going to
[03:15:36.680 --> 03:15:37.680]  do anything.
[03:15:37.680 --> 03:15:42.680]  And even if they do, will it be in the form of a 5% tax so the money will be held for
[03:15:42.680 --> 03:15:48.800]  you in your governmental annuity to be paid out when you retire?
[03:15:48.800 --> 03:16:01.600]  Or will it be a partial voluntary effort by pension holders to pledge part of or all of
[03:16:01.600 --> 03:16:05.520]  their retirement to one of these governmental annuities?
[03:16:05.520 --> 03:16:07.680]  Well, that's what Bloomberg said.
[03:16:07.680 --> 03:16:12.560]  They said regulators are ordering private pension funds to invest with them.
[03:16:12.560 --> 03:16:15.480]  That's a command and control economy right there.
[03:16:15.480 --> 03:16:18.520]  That's right, but that's different than this.
[03:16:18.520 --> 03:16:22.360]  And so I've told people, let's wait till the shoe to drop.
[03:16:22.360 --> 03:16:26.280]  Now what you're talking about is instructions from the federal government to pension and
[03:16:26.280 --> 03:16:34.800]  profit sharing plans, you will buy Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginny Mae, FHA, and U.S. Treasury
[03:16:34.800 --> 03:16:35.800]  paper.
[03:16:35.800 --> 03:16:36.800]  That's it.
[03:16:36.800 --> 03:16:41.040]  Which is an even better way to steal it, because the Bloomberg article said making them
[03:16:41.040 --> 03:16:45.720]  by failed banks, making them by assets and failed banks.
[03:16:45.720 --> 03:16:46.720]  That's true too.
[03:16:46.720 --> 03:16:54.240]  And incidentally, in your comment on Germany, I have here the information on the Bilderbergers
[03:16:54.240 --> 03:16:58.880]  who were within the German government, of course, Chancellor Merkel, Foreign Minister
[03:16:58.880 --> 03:17:12.840]  Vestival, Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaubel, Social Democrat, Walter Steinmeier, and Green
[03:17:12.840 --> 03:17:18.080]  Party opposition leader, Chem Oitzmeier.
[03:17:18.080 --> 03:17:22.680]  And so you got to say to yourself, the deck is packed.
[03:17:22.680 --> 03:17:30.560]  And what is going on right now is the German people are against the bailout, 63%.
[03:17:30.560 --> 03:17:42.960]  Number two, Mrs. Merkel and the Bundesrat have approved the money going with other monies.
[03:17:42.960 --> 03:17:46.720]  So she's just acting like she's upset because of the election.
[03:17:46.720 --> 03:17:47.720]  That's right.
[03:17:47.720 --> 03:17:48.720]  All right.
[03:17:48.720 --> 03:17:49.720]  Let's go to calls.
[03:17:49.720 --> 03:17:51.200]  Let's talk to Matt in Ohio.
[03:17:51.200 --> 03:17:52.520]  Matt, thanks for holding her on the ear.
[03:17:52.520 --> 03:17:53.520]  Go ahead.
[03:17:53.520 --> 03:17:54.520]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:17:54.520 --> 03:17:57.160]  This question is for both of you.
[03:17:57.160 --> 03:18:04.520]  I was doing some day trading yesterday and, of course, was watching when the stock market
[03:18:04.520 --> 03:18:05.520]  went down.
[03:18:05.520 --> 03:18:07.560]  Two quick points I wanted to make.
[03:18:07.560 --> 03:18:14.680]  One, my trading platform did allow me to get a trade in during those four or five minutes.
[03:18:14.680 --> 03:18:21.560]  So I don't know if it was, or my platform was missed by whatever shutdown went on or
[03:18:21.560 --> 03:18:27.640]  maybe the shutdown was basically just online servers being overloaded by all the volume.
[03:18:27.640 --> 03:18:32.560]  Second point is one thing I hadn't noticed anyone talking about that exact same four
[03:18:32.560 --> 03:18:39.440]  or five minutes where you had that massive 700-point drop in the Dow, 70-point drop in
[03:18:39.440 --> 03:18:40.940]  the S&P.
[03:18:40.940 --> 03:18:49.080]  You also saw an unprecedented spike, particularly in one currency, and that was the yen.
[03:18:49.080 --> 03:18:54.560]  It was almost an order of magnitude greater than the rise in most of the other currencies,
[03:18:54.560 --> 03:18:55.560]  like the dollar.
[03:18:55.560 --> 03:18:58.800]  The dollar was, I think, around three-quarters of a percent at that time.
[03:18:58.800 --> 03:19:04.160]  The yen was like six or seven percent, which is huge.
[03:19:04.160 --> 03:19:07.320]  And I was curious to get your take.
[03:19:07.320 --> 03:19:14.520]  Do you think people were using yen to short the market just to buy bids on the cheap or
[03:19:14.520 --> 03:19:15.760]  something else that occurred to me?
[03:19:15.760 --> 03:19:16.760]  Maybe this is for the reason-
[03:19:16.760 --> 03:19:19.200]  That's a great question.
[03:19:19.200 --> 03:19:20.200]  Bob?
[03:19:20.200 --> 03:19:32.600]  Well, the yen went from 93.63 the day before on the close to 89.88, which is a.0430 change,
[03:19:32.600 --> 03:19:34.240]  which is phenomenal.
[03:19:34.240 --> 03:19:40.000]  And so they had to be using yen to be doing the shorting in the market.
[03:19:40.000 --> 03:19:42.400]  Okay, great question, Matt.
[03:19:42.400 --> 03:19:43.400]  Thanks for calling.
[03:19:43.400 --> 03:19:46.720]  Lisa, Joe, Craig, and others are going to try to jam you all in.
[03:19:46.720 --> 03:19:51.000]  And our final segment with Bob Chapman, I'll continue with your phone calls on what happened
[03:19:51.000 --> 03:19:54.200]  yesterday and what the signals in the future.
[03:19:54.200 --> 03:20:01.920]  We have a managed, organized, rigged global financial market for the fat six banks.
[03:20:01.920 --> 03:20:06.400]  Are you tired of out-of-control, irresponsible federal deficit spending?
[03:20:06.400 --> 03:20:10.320]  Increasing the money supply without increasing productive output leads to inflation.
[03:20:10.320 --> 03:20:11.880]  You get less for your money.
[03:20:11.880 --> 03:20:16.000]  If you want to protect the buying power of dollars for your future, then call Peter May
[03:20:16.000 --> 03:20:22.720]  at Midas Resources, 800-686-2237 extension 135.
[03:20:22.720 --> 03:20:24.160]  You've worked hard for your dollars.
[03:20:24.160 --> 03:20:27.800]  Don't let the government strip their buying power with wasteful spending.
[03:20:27.800 --> 03:20:32.320]  Gold has a 5,000-year track record as money, real money you can count on.
[03:20:32.320 --> 03:20:35.320]  No government-backed paper currency comes close.
[03:20:35.320 --> 03:20:37.880]  Ask me about the protection of private gold.
[03:20:37.880 --> 03:20:45.800]  Call Peter May at Midas Resources, 800-686-2237 extension 135.
[03:20:45.800 --> 03:20:48.520]  Central banks from around the world are stockpiling gold.
[03:20:48.520 --> 03:20:50.360]  They know gold is real money.
[03:20:50.360 --> 03:20:59.200]  Call Peter May at Midas Resources, 800-686-2237 extension 135 to discover the advantages
[03:20:59.200 --> 03:21:01.640]  of private protected gold.
[03:21:01.640 --> 03:21:02.640]  Are you prepared?
[03:21:02.640 --> 03:21:05.360]  Well, you need to be hardcore prepared.
[03:21:05.360 --> 03:21:06.680]  There is a difference.
[03:21:06.680 --> 03:21:12.600]  To be hardcore prepared, equip yourself with the latest survival gear available at Taktowngear.com.
[03:21:12.600 --> 03:21:16.960]  All Taktown gear has been field tested by Canadian and U.S. forces, so you know it's
[03:21:16.960 --> 03:21:17.960]  tough.
[03:21:17.960 --> 03:21:18.960]  What kind of gear?

[03:21:26.120 --> 03:21:30.480]  knives, binoculars, sleeping bags, boots, weapons, accessories, and much more available

[03:22:08.960 --> 03:22:38.920]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution.
[03:22:38.920 --> 03:23:05.720]  In March, Alex Jones announced that eFoods Direct was putting together a high-volume
[03:23:05.720 --> 03:23:08.840]  pre-production order of the new Quick Fix Meals.
[03:23:08.840 --> 03:23:13.000]  By waiting for production and shipping of their orders, families were able to receive
[03:23:13.000 --> 03:23:16.360]  one free item for every three that they bought.
[03:23:16.360 --> 03:23:20.960]  Since the final shutdown of this Buy 3 Get 1 Free program, we've had a lot of folks calling,
[03:23:20.960 --> 03:23:23.080]  disappointed that they missed the order deadline.
[03:23:23.080 --> 03:23:24.480]  Listen carefully.
[03:23:24.480 --> 03:23:29.640]  Starting immediately, eFoodsDirect.com will take pre-production orders for a Buy 3 Get
[03:23:29.640 --> 03:23:34.080]  1 Free program for one week ending May 14th at midnight.
[03:23:34.080 --> 03:23:38.400]  You'll receive one free item for every three that you order of the selected products.
[03:23:38.400 --> 03:23:41.320]  These orders will begin shipping the first week of June.
[03:23:41.320 --> 03:23:49.800]  To order on the web, eFoodsDirect.com slash GCN or call 800-409-5633 that's eFoodsDirect.com
[03:23:49.800 --> 03:24:19.640]  slash GCN 800-409-5633, again that's eFoodsDirect.com slash GCN 800-409-5633.
[03:24:19.640 --> 03:24:20.640]  Follow this meltdown.
[03:24:20.640 --> 03:24:21.640]  Continue.
[03:24:21.640 --> 03:24:22.640]  What are the next nations to go under?
[03:24:22.640 --> 03:24:25.640]  When will they admit we're in a depression in this country?
[03:24:25.640 --> 03:24:36.160]  Well, the nations in trouble are Ireland, England, Portugal, Spain, followed by Italy,
[03:24:36.160 --> 03:24:38.040]  and in Western Europe.
[03:24:38.040 --> 03:24:44.160]  But there's some unbelievable problems in Eastern Europe and in the Ukraine.
[03:24:44.160 --> 03:24:48.240]  They're having riots here, but they're not reporting them because I had somebody in another
[03:24:48.240 --> 03:24:52.480]  program call in for the Ukraine yesterday and say, you know, you people don't know this
[03:24:52.480 --> 03:24:55.360]  because they're not reporting it, but they have riots here.
[03:24:55.360 --> 03:25:04.080]  And then you get Japan and a lot of your Lithuania, Estonia, Romania, Hungary, Argentina and incidentally
[03:25:04.080 --> 03:25:08.480]  Brazil is about to get absolutely inundated in inflation.
[03:25:08.480 --> 03:25:12.920]  And then we have Venezuela, Ecuador, and Bolivia that are going to run into trouble
[03:25:12.920 --> 03:25:15.160]  with their communistic data ships.
[03:25:15.160 --> 03:25:19.360]  And you also have a new communist dictator and Uruguay as well.
[03:25:19.360 --> 03:25:24.160]  And so all over the world, we're going to have countries that are going to go bankrupt,
[03:25:24.160 --> 03:25:26.640]  including the United States.
[03:25:26.640 --> 03:25:28.480]  Let's jam in some more calls here.
[03:25:28.480 --> 03:25:29.880]  Let's talk to Fred in Iowa.
[03:25:29.880 --> 03:25:31.280]  Fred, thanks for holding.
[03:25:31.280 --> 03:25:32.280]  Welcome.
[03:25:32.280 --> 03:25:39.840]  I was stupid for not getting an international forecaster, but I'm a very small Friday day
[03:25:39.840 --> 03:25:46.960]  trader and I only trade gold and silver stocks and I'm holding my own with a little game.
[03:25:46.960 --> 03:25:52.680]  Did I pull everything out or should I continue trading gold stocks, which I seem to be doing
[03:25:52.680 --> 03:25:53.680]  so-so?
[03:25:53.680 --> 03:25:58.760]  Well, I think you should continue to trade them and one in doubt stay long.
[03:25:58.760 --> 03:26:00.760]  Well, got you there.
[03:26:00.760 --> 03:26:05.720]  I thought I had some good news from Iowa, but I don't know.
[03:26:05.720 --> 03:26:08.960]  Well, thank you, Alex, and thank you, Bob, and God bless you both.
[03:26:08.960 --> 03:26:09.960]  Thank you, Fred.
[03:26:09.960 --> 03:26:10.960]  Thank you.
[03:26:10.960 --> 03:26:14.760]  Yeah, they normally just run down gold for a few days, a few weeks, but watch the trend.
[03:26:14.760 --> 03:26:16.160]  It only goes up.
[03:26:16.160 --> 03:26:18.760]  Let's talk to Lisa and Georgia.
[03:26:18.760 --> 03:26:19.760]  You're on the air.
[03:26:19.760 --> 03:26:20.760]  Go ahead.
[03:26:20.760 --> 03:26:21.760]  Hi, how are you?
[03:26:21.760 --> 03:26:23.520]  I happen to be a new listener.
[03:26:23.520 --> 03:26:30.880]  I happen to run across your videos on YouTube and I've sort of been in an information run.
[03:26:30.880 --> 03:26:35.800]  One of the questions I wanted to ask is, what about silver?
[03:26:35.800 --> 03:26:42.120]  I hear a lot on your show about from Bob Chapman and, hi, how are you, Bob, about buying silver
[03:26:42.120 --> 03:26:43.120]  and gold?
[03:26:43.120 --> 03:26:45.360]  I mean, should you buy equal amounts?
[03:26:45.360 --> 03:26:47.360]  Should you buy more silver?
[03:26:47.360 --> 03:26:48.360]  I'm confused.
[03:26:48.360 --> 03:26:49.960]  Well, I know what I do personally.
[03:26:49.960 --> 03:26:54.360]  I buy more gold than silver, probably 75% gold, 25% silver.
[03:26:54.360 --> 03:26:55.480]  I don't give advice.
[03:26:55.480 --> 03:26:58.000]  That's what I would do, Bob.
[03:26:58.000 --> 03:26:59.640]  I did the same thing the other day.
[03:26:59.640 --> 03:27:07.200]  I bought six silver coins and I bought seven gold coins and the gold coins were one ounce.
[03:27:07.200 --> 03:27:15.920]  So we're talking about $10,000, so I do about 25% silver and 75% gold coins.
[03:27:15.920 --> 03:27:16.920]  I didn't know that.
[03:27:16.920 --> 03:27:19.120]  One of the reasons is a weight, if nothing else.
[03:27:19.120 --> 03:27:21.960]  Yeah, there's the portability.
[03:27:21.960 --> 03:27:26.600]  You can move gold a lot easier and hide it a lot easier than you can silver.
[03:27:26.600 --> 03:27:30.400]  I've been having a hard time convincing my husband, we have quite a bit of money in the
[03:27:30.400 --> 03:27:33.400]  market and I'm very worried.
[03:27:33.400 --> 03:27:39.040]  And every day I watch your, I listen to your radio show, I just feel like there's just
[03:27:39.040 --> 03:27:41.240]  something new every day, there's more, there's a lot.
[03:27:41.240 --> 03:27:42.240]  I can't even keep up.
[03:27:42.240 --> 03:27:45.400]  Well, he should at least hedge his bet and buy some bullion.
[03:27:45.400 --> 03:27:50.400]  I mean, doesn't he know gold seven years ago was $300 an ounce?
[03:27:50.400 --> 03:27:56.080]  Yeah, we're military, but he's been gone a lot and in and out.
[03:27:56.080 --> 03:28:04.080]  You know what you should do, email me your phone number and I'll call him.
[03:28:04.080 --> 03:28:06.720]  Bob will do that too, he's something else.
[03:28:06.720 --> 03:28:11.240]  And I do a military program every Thursday and I've done it for almost five years and
[03:28:11.240 --> 03:28:13.640]  I'm a veteran as well.
[03:28:13.640 --> 03:28:27.000]  Bob at intforecaster.com, B-O-B-A-T-F-O-R-E-C-A-S-T-E-R.com and I will call you and I will talk to
[03:28:27.000 --> 03:28:28.000]  him.
[03:28:28.000 --> 03:28:29.760]  All right, let's jam in one more call.
[03:28:29.760 --> 03:28:33.280]  Let's go ahead and talk to Joe in Ohio.
[03:28:33.280 --> 03:28:34.280]  Go ahead Joe.
[03:28:34.280 --> 03:28:37.280]  Hey guys, this is a pleasure and honor.
[03:28:37.280 --> 03:28:41.760]  It's funny that you bring up the government drug running thing.
[03:28:41.760 --> 03:28:44.720]  I went to college in the early 80s at the University of Arkansas, I met Bill Clinton
[03:28:44.720 --> 03:28:49.280]  while he was running for reelection and I'd heard insider information just gossiped that
[03:28:49.280 --> 03:28:53.200]  there's some shenanigans going on in Little Rock and then my awakening was watching the
[03:28:53.200 --> 03:28:58.320]  film Clinton Chronicles and then had a hard time sleeping after that.
[03:28:58.320 --> 03:29:02.480]  How do these cops raid everybody for marijuana when they know the government's shipping
[03:29:02.480 --> 03:29:03.480]  in the hard drugs?
[03:29:03.480 --> 03:29:06.440]  I mean, it's just, you know, because they're part of the drug business.
[03:29:06.440 --> 03:29:08.960]  They're bottom feeding off the poor fools that use it.
[03:29:08.960 --> 03:29:09.960]  Sorry, go ahead.
[03:29:09.960 --> 03:29:13.840]  Yeah, because most people don't know that, no, I mean, but I was a Russian limbo listener
[03:29:13.840 --> 03:29:15.680]  back then and they were really pushing that film.
[03:29:15.680 --> 03:29:19.440]  Remember Alex, they were handing it out and on Washington, everybody got a VHS copy of
[03:29:19.440 --> 03:29:24.000]  it and then suddenly you'd think a lot of people would have seen it, but.
[03:29:24.000 --> 03:29:25.000]  You know what?
[03:29:25.000 --> 03:29:27.600]  I've held Bob so long, but Bob, will you do five more minutes?
[03:29:27.600 --> 03:29:30.520]  We can finish up with him and then Craig and Steve, then I'll let you go.
[03:29:30.520 --> 03:29:36.160]  Listen, go get the book compromised and that'll turn your hair white.
[03:29:36.160 --> 03:29:37.160]  Stay there, Bob.
[03:29:37.160 --> 03:29:39.320]  Do a few more minutes with us on Compromise, Terry Reed.
[03:29:39.320 --> 03:29:40.920]  And I want Terry Reed back on.
[03:29:40.920 --> 03:29:41.920]  He lives in Kansas City.
[03:29:41.920 --> 03:29:42.920]  He's a big fan of the show.
[03:29:42.920 --> 03:29:43.920]  Haven't been on five years.
[03:29:43.920 --> 03:29:44.920]  Bob, can you hold?
[03:29:44.920 --> 03:29:45.920]  Certainly.
[03:29:45.920 --> 03:29:46.920]  All right.
[03:29:46.920 --> 03:29:47.920]  Bob Chapman, stay there.
[03:29:47.920 --> 03:29:48.920]  We'll come back to you too.
[03:29:48.920 --> 03:29:51.840]  Stay with us, Joe.
[03:29:51.840 --> 03:29:53.120]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.120 --> 03:29:55.840]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.840 --> 03:29:59.320]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[03:30:20.040 --> 03:30:25.720]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver
[03:30:25.720 --> 03:30:32.000]  solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[03:30:32.000 --> 03:30:36.320]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now
[03:30:36.320 --> 03:30:41.640]  produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.

[03:31:50.000 --> 03:31:52.040]  The police state isn't coming.
[03:31:52.040 --> 03:31:53.040]  It's here.

[03:33:07.080 --> 03:33:09.920]  Okay we're going to continue with your phone calls and what happened in the market yesterday,
[03:33:09.920 --> 03:33:15.720]  but this illustrates to everyone, A, how rigged the market is, B, how volatile it is, and
[03:33:15.720 --> 03:33:17.600]  how much the media will lie to you.
[03:33:17.600 --> 03:33:22.800]  There were record trades, stocks being dumped, in Europe they had to shut down the major
[03:33:22.800 --> 03:33:28.240]  stock exchanges, right as this happened because people were dumping their stocks, it's all
[03:33:28.240 --> 03:33:33.160]  interconnected, it goes down by almost a thousand points or right at a thousand points, one
[03:33:33.160 --> 03:33:38.400]  point short of it, and then it goes right back up 700 points, right after it, I mean
[03:33:38.400 --> 03:33:42.960]  this is rigged and I wanted to go back to your calls on government drug dealing, you
[03:33:42.960 --> 03:33:47.680]  were trying to get into Terry Reed, he was a CIA trainer, he saw Bill Clinton, he saw
[03:33:47.680 --> 03:33:53.560]  him all there at MENA, they started killing local kids, he wasn't involved in that but
[03:33:53.560 --> 03:33:57.680]  he learned about it, he spoke out about it, he wrote a huge book, Compromise, Clinton
[03:33:57.680 --> 03:34:03.280]  Bush and the CIA, but I mean now they're on Fox News interviewing the commander with
[03:34:03.280 --> 03:34:08.280]  the Marines saying yeah we help grow the opium, I mean it's just in your face, I mean I guess
[03:34:08.280 --> 03:34:13.280]  soon the cops will deliver the heroin and then when you buy it they'll put you in handcuffs
[03:34:13.280 --> 03:34:17.920]  on the spot to shoot your dog, Bob Chapman comments on that.
[03:34:17.920 --> 03:34:23.040]  That's what it's getting to and it's a shame because they've been compromised, they've
[03:34:23.040 --> 03:34:30.000]  been federalized and you know I really am concerned for the future because there's going
[03:34:30.000 --> 03:34:37.880]  to come a time if we can clear Congress and get things changed that people like that will
[03:34:37.880 --> 03:34:42.240]  be thrown in jail and that's something they know they shouldn't be doing.
[03:34:42.240 --> 03:34:47.440]  On the other hand if we're unsuccessful and this thing turns into a revolution, I wouldn't
[03:34:47.440 --> 03:34:51.240]  give two cents for their lifespan.
[03:34:51.240 --> 03:34:56.280]  Well anybody that watches this video that's up on infowars.com right now is the top story,
[03:34:56.280 --> 03:35:01.160]  I mean this tells it all, government admits they deal heroin but terrorize families for
[03:35:01.160 --> 03:35:03.520]  pot, it is so important.
[03:35:03.520 --> 03:35:07.160]  Anything else, caller you want to add before I take two final calls for Bob Chapman, Joe?
[03:35:07.160 --> 03:35:10.880]  Yeah, real quick, I just thought of the Clinton thing while I was on hold, the reason why
[03:35:10.880 --> 03:35:14.520]  I called and I want to get your input on this and throw it out, you haven't really mentioned
[03:35:14.520 --> 03:35:20.320]  it this calendar year at least or any of you, Max, Bob or Gerald or anybody else, we have
[03:35:20.320 --> 03:35:23.800]  the biggest distraction coming up next month.
[03:35:23.800 --> 03:35:30.240]  Billions of people are going to be glued to billions of TVs and that's the World Cup
[03:35:30.240 --> 03:35:33.000]  and especially as good as the United States team is this year, I'm just wondering, that's
[03:35:33.000 --> 03:35:38.080]  just the theory that I'm working on, if they might, it leads to just my plans for something
[03:35:38.080 --> 03:35:41.600]  and also because remember where it's taking place, it's the World Cup tournament going
[03:35:41.600 --> 03:35:42.600]  on in South Africa.
[03:35:42.600 --> 03:35:47.520]  Yeah, the globalists are setting up race riots down there right now and they love to stage
[03:35:47.520 --> 03:35:52.880]  terror events during big TV events to make sure all slaves get their programming, I appreciate
[03:35:52.880 --> 03:35:53.880]  your call.
[03:35:53.880 --> 03:35:59.040]  They're going to need more false flag attacks, what they do is they get a CIA asset like
[03:35:59.040 --> 03:36:03.720]  Tim McVeigh or Lee Harvey Oswald, it's been confirmed, declassified that both of them were
[03:36:03.720 --> 03:36:08.680]  secret government agents, same thing with this Pakistani guy, we've got the documents
[03:36:08.680 --> 03:36:12.560]  that he was part of a secret CIA operation, we know they were running a drill in Times
[03:36:12.560 --> 03:36:15.360]  Square, that evidence has now been confirmed.
[03:36:15.360 --> 03:36:21.480]  Your take on more stage terror attacks and Mayor Bloomberg, Bob Chapman, trying to blame
[03:36:21.480 --> 03:36:25.880]  the Tea Parties for the failed bombing in Times Square.
[03:36:25.880 --> 03:36:32.480]  Well, you can expect that from Mayor Bloomberg of New York City, I grew up in the next town
[03:36:32.480 --> 03:36:37.160]  over from him, he was in Medford and I was in some of them in Massachusetts, although
[03:36:37.160 --> 03:36:44.320]  I did not know him, I lived in South Africa in Rhodesia and I'm still very well connected
[03:36:44.320 --> 03:36:52.560]  particularly in South Africa and you saw the murder a few weeks ago of Eugene Terre Blanche,
[03:36:52.560 --> 03:37:00.040]  that was the kickoff and I think they may have quite a difficult time filling any of
[03:37:00.040 --> 03:37:10.240]  the stadiums for these games down there and also I have links and information from the
[03:37:10.240 --> 03:37:20.680]  press from South Africa saying that a segment of the ANC which runs the country are planning
[03:37:20.680 --> 03:37:25.200]  riots and so it bears out what you've just said, Alex.
[03:37:25.200 --> 03:37:28.760]  Absolutely, yeah, they killed the leader of the boars down there just three weeks ago
[03:37:28.760 --> 03:37:32.200]  or two and a half weeks ago, quickly because we're going to let Bob go here in a moment,
[03:37:32.200 --> 03:37:36.480]  I'll continue with your calls and other key news items we haven't hit yet and some recaps.
[03:37:36.480 --> 03:37:40.960]  Let's talk to Craig in Seattle, you're on the air, go ahead Craig.
[03:37:40.960 --> 03:37:43.840]  Alex, thank you very much for taking my call.
[03:37:43.840 --> 03:37:47.880]  My question is, the thousand point drop on the stock market, does that have anything
[03:37:47.880 --> 03:37:54.880]  to do with audit the Fed or influencing votes or another shot across the bow to whomever
[03:37:54.880 --> 03:37:57.080]  as far as the panic in the streets?
[03:37:57.080 --> 03:38:00.960]  Well, I know this, it's admitted and confirmed, we cover it in the Obama deception, we interview
[03:38:00.960 --> 03:38:04.960]  a congressman about it, they did go out and say we're going to have depression to drive
[03:38:04.960 --> 03:38:09.280]  the stock market down, the plunge protection team stood back to terrorize the public into
[03:38:09.280 --> 03:38:14.840]  giving the bankers tens of trillions of dollars and the audit the Fed bill is moving through,
[03:38:14.840 --> 03:38:18.480]  they are panicking to block it, Bob Chapman.
[03:38:18.480 --> 03:38:23.440]  You're absolutely correct and that bill is the nationalization of all banks among a
[03:38:23.440 --> 03:38:28.240]  whole bunch of other things that we've had in the forecaster and of course Alex has talked
[03:38:28.240 --> 03:38:34.760]  about and they're doing everything possible not to let anybody know that there's such
[03:38:34.760 --> 03:38:41.640]  a bill and of course, Dodd is sold out like his father sold out and they just pay them
[03:38:41.640 --> 03:38:46.720]  off and they go on their way and they live happily ever after or at least they have up
[03:38:46.720 --> 03:38:48.840]  until now.
[03:38:48.840 --> 03:38:54.920]  And so many of these events, I think part of the reason for the Goldman Sachs pursuance
[03:38:54.920 --> 03:39:01.720]  is not only the fact that they knew the suits were coming, lawsuits, but they also needed
[03:39:01.720 --> 03:39:04.720]  a distraction and that was it.
[03:39:04.720 --> 03:39:10.880]  Well, they're going after mid-level traders and saying they made a mistake and I've seen
[03:39:10.880 --> 03:39:15.440]  Blank Fine on TV saying, oh, we've learned from this, oh, we want this other re-regulation
[03:39:15.440 --> 03:39:21.160]  bill that even the Texas Banking Association says will allow the mega banks to selectively
[03:39:21.160 --> 03:39:25.640]  come in and take over healthy regional banks that are actually lending to the people.
[03:39:25.640 --> 03:39:30.600]  Well, that's true and you know, there's 2,000 banks in the country that are being run by
[03:39:30.600 --> 03:39:33.000]  the Comptroller of the Commercy.
[03:39:33.000 --> 03:39:34.000]  Incredible.
[03:39:34.000 --> 03:39:39.120]  Okay, let's take two more calls and let Bob go quickly.
[03:39:39.120 --> 03:39:41.400]  Let's talk to, boy, the list has gotten so long here.
[03:39:41.400 --> 03:39:43.240]  Who's up next, John?
[03:39:43.240 --> 03:39:46.320]  Stephen Illinois, you're on the air with Bob Chapman, go ahead.
[03:39:46.320 --> 03:39:50.160]  I am a strict follower of Messianic Judaism.
[03:39:50.160 --> 03:39:53.960]  I have fought this since 1980, locally and nationally.
[03:39:53.960 --> 03:39:58.360]  I nailed Dr. Bill Frisk's re-election bid of late.
[03:39:58.360 --> 03:40:02.360]  You will watch terrible times and wonderful times are coming.
[03:40:02.360 --> 03:40:06.400]  They're going to take down the electrical power grid for this country and you are going
[03:40:06.400 --> 03:40:09.120]  to witness divine intervention.
[03:40:09.120 --> 03:40:12.040]  You heard it here first and I thank you very kindly for the time.
[03:40:12.040 --> 03:40:13.920]  All right, appreciate your call.
[03:40:13.920 --> 03:40:15.560]  Let's talk to Ed in Minnesota.
[03:40:15.560 --> 03:40:19.200]  Any questions for Bob?
[03:40:19.200 --> 03:40:25.160]  I think we should go back to the gold standard, actually have like coins with just a minuscule
[03:40:25.160 --> 03:40:27.920]  amount of real gold, banning it.
[03:40:27.920 --> 03:40:33.640]  And another thing is, I believe that the government is passing a lot of laws to make
[03:40:33.640 --> 03:40:39.440]  anybody a felon, whether it's BWI or whatever, just so they have the right to take away your
[03:40:39.440 --> 03:40:40.440]  arms.
[03:40:40.440 --> 03:40:41.440]  Oh, there's no doubt.
[03:40:41.440 --> 03:40:45.520]  They're trying to pass bills right now without a judge, jury, charges.
[03:40:45.520 --> 03:40:48.560]  You just can't own guns if the FBI says so.
[03:40:48.560 --> 03:40:54.120]  And they're trying to pass bills where they can arrest U.S. citizens and the Pentagon and
[03:40:54.120 --> 03:40:58.720]  Justice Department can secretly strip you of your citizenship and you are never seen
[03:40:58.720 --> 03:40:59.720]  again.
[03:40:59.720 --> 03:41:02.960]  Bob Chapman, your take on that.
[03:41:02.960 --> 03:41:06.040]  Absolutely correct and that's where they're headed.
[03:41:06.040 --> 03:41:12.360]  And they're in the forefront, along with England and Australia's, tagging right behind.
[03:41:12.360 --> 03:41:15.560]  And that's what they're going to do, or at least that's what they intend to do.
[03:41:15.560 --> 03:41:17.360]  I mean, there's no doubt this is tyranny.
[03:41:17.360 --> 03:41:18.360]  Ed, I appreciate your call.
[03:41:18.360 --> 03:41:21.840]  I'm going through these quick to get financial questions and brokers and people because this
[03:41:21.840 --> 03:41:22.840]  is the big issue.
[03:41:22.840 --> 03:41:25.040]  This really shows how rigged the markets are.
[03:41:25.040 --> 03:41:29.160]  And for those who just tuned in, it's admitted they've been rigged since 1987.
[03:41:29.160 --> 03:41:31.320]  Break that down briefly, Bob Chapman.
[03:41:31.320 --> 03:41:39.600]  Well, it was the introduction of the Working Group of Financial Markets by Ronald Reagan
[03:41:39.600 --> 03:41:46.640]  under an executive order and it was to keep order in plunging markets.
[03:41:46.640 --> 03:41:51.800]  And that's why it's called the Plunge Protection Team euphemistically.
[03:41:51.800 --> 03:41:56.040]  But they've done, as they distorted the whole thing, and they're using it to rape everybody
[03:41:56.040 --> 03:42:03.400]  financially, and they manipulate markets 24 hours a day all over the world.
[03:42:03.400 --> 03:42:06.400]  Wow, a casino that's rigged.
[03:42:06.400 --> 03:42:07.840]  I find that hard to believe.
[03:42:07.840 --> 03:42:10.520]  I'm joking.
[03:42:10.520 --> 03:42:11.520]  Real fast.
[03:42:11.520 --> 03:42:13.640]  Cliff in Kansas, you're on the air with Alex Jones and Bob Chapman.
[03:42:13.640 --> 03:42:14.640]  Go ahead.
[03:42:14.640 --> 03:42:19.160]  Well, yeah, I feel like this is that movie, it's a wonderful life.
[03:42:19.160 --> 03:42:22.040]  Potter's the spelling, Potter's buying.
[03:42:22.040 --> 03:42:27.040]  But I worry about, because me and my wife are going to try and refinance the new garage.
[03:42:27.040 --> 03:42:28.040]  You guys think that's...
[03:42:28.040 --> 03:42:32.320]  Should people go on to get no more debt or is that not a good thing?
[03:42:32.320 --> 03:42:33.520]  I don't think it's a good thing.
[03:42:33.520 --> 03:42:38.960]  I think anyone you can get a hold of, she should be taking advantage of Midas and going
[03:42:38.960 --> 03:42:43.160]  in there and buying gold and silver coins and forgetting about things that you don't
[03:42:43.160 --> 03:42:44.480]  have to do.
[03:42:44.480 --> 03:42:50.720]  Well, another thing is too, with this financial crash going down, are they just going to start
[03:42:50.720 --> 03:42:54.480]  pulling people to mortgages or what's going to happen with that?
[03:42:54.480 --> 03:43:00.600]  That's a good question because I think ultimately there's going to be a multilateral devaluation
[03:43:00.600 --> 03:43:05.240]  of all currencies against one another, never mind gold, because they're all going down
[03:43:05.240 --> 03:43:07.440]  every day against gold.
[03:43:07.440 --> 03:43:13.720]  I think there's going to be a debt settlement multinationally between nations.
[03:43:13.720 --> 03:43:14.720]  Absolutely.
[03:43:14.720 --> 03:43:15.720]  We've got to let you go, Bob.
[03:43:15.720 --> 03:43:17.600]  We've got to let the caller go.
[03:43:17.600 --> 03:43:19.920]  But Bob, you'll be back with us next Friday for a full hour.
[03:43:19.920 --> 03:43:24.560]  You've given us an hour and 40 minutes today, and make sure next week to remind me, because
[03:43:24.560 --> 03:43:28.560]  Gerald Solente was saying the same thing, so is Max Kaiser, that they are planning
[03:43:28.560 --> 03:43:34.760]  and you've got the evidence for a global coordinated devaluation of the currency.
[03:43:34.760 --> 03:43:38.320]  Bob Chapman, theinternationalforecaster.com, thank you for spending so much time with
[03:43:38.320 --> 03:43:39.400]  us.
[03:43:39.400 --> 03:43:41.480]  You're welcome, and thank you all for listening.
[03:43:41.480 --> 03:43:42.480]  You bet.
[03:43:42.480 --> 03:43:43.840]  Okay, I'll come back in the final segment.
[03:43:43.840 --> 03:43:48.080]  They played a clip of some of our work on CNN and take a few calls, but I want to go
[03:43:48.080 --> 03:43:54.320]  out to break with the new infowars.com trailer for the new film, Don't Tread on Me.
[03:43:54.320 --> 03:43:55.520]  It comes out in one week.
[03:43:55.520 --> 03:43:56.520]  You can pre-order it now.
[03:43:56.520 --> 03:44:01.400]  It exposes the truth of states' rights and the fraud of democracy and how we're going
[03:44:01.400 --> 03:44:02.920]  to take this country back.
[03:44:02.920 --> 03:44:03.920]  You can order it now.
[03:44:03.920 --> 03:44:08.600]  It's an incredible film to wake people up with a key solution to take America back.
[03:44:08.600 --> 03:44:21.680]  Here it is.
[03:44:21.680 --> 03:44:30.600]  If the government we organize under the people's constitution survives the next 20 years, may
[03:44:30.600 --> 03:44:32.760]  go on forever.
[03:44:32.760 --> 03:44:38.320]  George Washington said that government is not reason.
[03:44:38.320 --> 03:44:39.320]  It is not eloquence.
[03:44:39.320 --> 03:44:40.320]  It is force.
[03:44:40.320 --> 03:44:48.040]  And like fire is a dangerous servant and a fearful man.
[03:44:48.040 --> 03:44:54.240]  The last 20 years we've seen an acceleration away from our Constitution Bill of Rights
[03:44:54.240 --> 03:44:56.240]  and towards absolute despotism.
[03:44:56.240 --> 03:44:58.240]  What have we got?
[03:44:58.240 --> 03:45:01.240]  A republic or a monarchy?
[03:45:01.240 --> 03:45:02.240]  A republic.
[03:45:02.240 --> 03:45:07.240]  If you can keep it so, you have been warned.
[03:45:07.240 --> 03:45:10.240]  All men are created equal.
[03:45:10.240 --> 03:45:15.240]  A pure democracy establishes majority rule with a minority overrun.
[03:45:15.240 --> 03:45:17.240]  Yes, it does.
[03:45:17.240 --> 03:45:22.240]  On the other hand, our republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[03:45:22.240 --> 03:45:27.240]  And it's important too that in our republic, authority is surrounded by an ingenious system
[03:45:27.240 --> 03:45:29.240]  of checks and balances.
[03:45:29.240 --> 03:45:33.240]  It is these freedoms that have made America strong.
[03:45:33.240 --> 03:45:36.240]  Okay, okay, so we got our freedom.
[03:45:36.240 --> 03:45:38.240]  But man, you must loosen up everything.
[03:45:38.240 --> 03:45:40.240]  There are tough times on Main Street.
[03:45:40.240 --> 03:45:44.240]  Unemployment reached double digits and small businesses are struggling to stay alive.
[03:45:44.240 --> 03:45:47.240]  We never want a serious crisis to go to waste.
[03:45:47.240 --> 03:45:51.240]  We kind of agree with Mao that political power comes largely from the barrel of a gun.
[03:45:51.240 --> 03:45:52.240]  Great!
[03:45:52.240 --> 03:45:53.240]  Great!
[03:45:53.240 --> 03:45:55.240]  How can we help the every step right of folks?
[03:45:55.240 --> 03:45:57.240]  Here's the answer to your problems.
[03:45:57.240 --> 03:46:01.240]  Doctor, you hope your sensational new discovery isn't.
[03:46:01.240 --> 03:46:06.240]  In Russia, they don't allow protest except for free speech zones.
[03:46:06.240 --> 03:46:08.240]  The United States has adopted that.
[03:46:08.240 --> 03:46:12.240]  In communist China, they only allow authorized demonstrations.
[03:46:12.240 --> 03:46:14.240]  We now have the same system here.
[03:46:14.240 --> 03:46:20.240]  And if you notice, our media doesn't criticize Russia's tyranny or China's oppression anymore
[03:46:20.240 --> 03:46:23.240]  because they would look like hypocrites if they did.
[03:46:23.240 --> 03:46:27.240]  Our government is doing everything that dictators do.
[03:46:27.240 --> 03:46:34.240]  We're going to pay you to sell out your own citizens of people in very high power places of power
[03:46:34.240 --> 03:46:37.240]  that are laughing at people who bring up the Constitution.
[03:46:37.240 --> 03:46:39.240]  I don't worry about the Constitution.
[03:46:39.240 --> 03:46:40.240]  I'm just to be honest.
[03:46:40.240 --> 03:46:41.240]  That's my...
[03:46:41.240 --> 03:46:42.240]  That's my...
[03:46:42.240 --> 03:46:43.240]  Jackpot, brother.
[03:46:43.240 --> 03:46:47.240]  Rights and privileges are opposites.
[03:46:47.240 --> 03:46:53.240]  A privilege is something that's given to you by someone or some entity that has authority over and above you.
[03:46:53.240 --> 03:46:59.240]  They are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights.
[03:46:59.240 --> 03:47:06.240]  Among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
[03:47:06.240 --> 03:47:08.240]  I am not your property.
[03:47:08.240 --> 03:47:10.240]  I am not a slave.
[03:47:10.240 --> 03:47:13.240]  And our Declaration of Independence was unique in history
[03:47:13.240 --> 03:47:20.240]  where the people created a new government and constituted it to be a protector of their basic rights and freedoms.
[03:47:20.240 --> 03:47:25.240]  Not democracy, not mob rule, two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[03:47:25.240 --> 03:47:28.240]  So they think they own our land, they think they own our water,
[03:47:28.240 --> 03:47:31.240]  they think they own our children, our education, our money.
[03:47:31.240 --> 03:47:34.240]  How many gallons of water we can have in our toilet?
[03:47:34.240 --> 03:47:40.240]  Well, the theory is to challenge the Commerce Clause power of Congress with a tenth amendment spin.
[03:47:40.240 --> 03:47:48.240]  The main point of passing a resolution is we have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[03:47:48.240 --> 03:47:51.240]  When it reaches the stage that you can look at what's going on and say,
[03:47:51.240 --> 03:47:57.240]  well, this is just a series of use of patients' abuses which are leading inexorably to this result,
[03:47:57.240 --> 03:48:04.240]  then it is not simply one's right, it is your duty to take this kind of action.
[03:48:04.240 --> 03:48:09.240]  And the question was, Mr. Bednarik, what is your position on mandatory vaccinations?
[03:48:09.240 --> 03:48:13.240]  No, absolutely not. I will never take a mandatory vaccination.
[03:48:13.240 --> 03:48:22.240]  And my answer to the question was, you bring the syringe, I'll bring my 45 and we'll see who makes a bigger hole.
[03:48:22.240 --> 03:48:27.240]  Somebody is going to ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[03:48:27.240 --> 03:48:31.240]  They're going to ask you what you did during the years of 2010, 11 and 12.
[03:48:31.240 --> 03:48:40.240]  You are an American citizen and you shall be arrested for having freedom of speech
[03:48:40.240 --> 03:48:43.240]  and using the first amendment of the United States Constitution.
[03:48:48.240 --> 03:48:51.240]  Fellow Info Warriors, I am so excited.
[03:48:51.240 --> 03:48:53.240]  It is the spring of 2010.
[03:48:53.240 --> 03:48:57.240]  We just released Invisible Empire and New World are defined at police state for the rise of FEMA.
[03:48:57.240 --> 03:49:03.240]  And then I got in the mail, the long-awaited Don't Tread on Me documentary film by director William Lewis
[03:49:03.240 --> 03:49:07.240]  and, of course, producer Gary Franchi, the folks that brought you Camp FEMA
[03:49:07.240 --> 03:49:10.240]  that has really upset the establishment of the national media,
[03:49:10.240 --> 03:49:13.240]  the Southern Prairie Law Center and ADL have been demonizing.
[03:49:13.240 --> 03:49:16.240]  Well, if they got upset by that film, they're really going to hate this one.
[03:49:16.240 --> 03:49:20.240]  It exposes the truth about democracy versus the republic.
[03:49:20.240 --> 03:49:26.240]  It explains states' rights and nullification and how the states can take the federal government back
[03:49:26.240 --> 03:49:29.240]  because the federal government has been seized by offshore corporations.
[03:49:29.240 --> 03:49:31.240]  It covers it all.
[03:49:31.240 --> 03:49:36.240]  A serious info weapon dropping May 17th at infowars.com.
[03:49:36.240 --> 03:49:39.240]  Pre-order the DVD today so you will get it first.
[03:49:39.240 --> 03:49:42.240]  We'll start shipping these suckers out to you on May 17th.
[03:49:42.240 --> 03:49:44.240]  Show it to everybody you know.
[03:49:44.240 --> 03:49:46.240]  Don't Tread on Me.
[03:49:46.240 --> 03:49:50.240]  It is a key weapon in the Info War so Americans know their rights
[03:49:50.240 --> 03:49:55.240]  and have solutions to take this republic back from the globalist.
[03:49:55.240 --> 03:50:01.240]  This is a key educational documentary and it's done in a very exciting, fast-paced way.
[03:50:01.240 --> 03:50:06.240]  This is going to be a great tool to restore the republic, a great tool to teach people about
[03:50:06.240 --> 03:50:09.240]  what the republic and our freedoms really stand for.
[03:50:09.240 --> 03:50:14.240]  The bill of rights, the constitution, states' rights, nullifying the health care bill,
[03:50:14.240 --> 03:50:18.240]  all this unconstitutional garbage that's happening, the gun grabbing, it covers it all.
[03:50:18.240 --> 03:50:22.240]  Order the film today at infowars.com or call toll free.
[03:50:22.240 --> 03:50:26.240]  888-253-3139.

[03:50:27.240 --> 03:50:31.240]  The government and the private corporations that control it don't own Alex Jones
[03:50:31.240 --> 03:50:35.240]  and this film, Don't Tread on Me, puts the facts on the table
[03:50:35.240 --> 03:50:38.240]  and will further awaken the sleeping giant.
[03:50:38.240 --> 03:50:39.240]  Don't Tread on Me.
[03:50:39.240 --> 03:50:43.240]  And it's my prayer that you'll be able to say that you were right in the middle of it
[03:50:43.240 --> 03:50:47.240]  and that you had a piece of this fight.
[03:50:47.240 --> 03:50:50.240]  Don't Tread on Us.
[03:50:50.240 --> 03:50:53.240]  We're not afraid.
[03:50:53.240 --> 03:50:57.240]  You were for us.
[03:50:57.240 --> 03:51:00.240]  We're not your slaves.
[03:51:00.240 --> 03:51:04.240]  Don't Tread on Us.
[03:51:04.240 --> 03:51:08.240]  If you start your heart when the phone rings knowing it may be another bill collector,

[03:52:30.240 --> 03:52:34.240]  have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:52:34.240 --> 03:52:38.240]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution
[03:52:38.240 --> 03:52:40.240]  for the global financial system.
[03:52:40.240 --> 03:52:43.240]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:52:43.240 --> 03:52:46.240]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.

[03:53:59.240 --> 03:54:25.240]  Here's that song you heard at the end of the film trailer for Don't Tread on Me.
[03:54:25.240 --> 03:54:32.240]  It's got a bunch of great tracks. The website's www.zanna.us.
[03:54:32.240 --> 03:54:34.240]  And I've actually interviewed these folks.
[03:54:34.240 --> 03:54:36.240]  I didn't know they were musicians before.
[03:54:36.240 --> 03:54:44.240]  They were the ones that videotaped army checkpoints in Arizona just harassing citizens.
[03:54:44.240 --> 03:54:47.240]  So great music also with the film Don't Tread on Me.
[03:54:47.240 --> 03:54:50.240]  Be the first to get it again. Get it at infowars.com.
[03:54:50.240 --> 03:54:53.240]  You also fund the Patriot Resistance.

[03:54:55.240 --> 03:54:58.240]  We don't have George Soros and the federal government funding us, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:54:58.240 --> 03:55:00.240]  We have the population funding us.
[03:55:00.240 --> 03:55:04.240]  And I'm very thankful to all our AM and FM affiliates, Global Shortwave Satellite Internet.
[03:55:04.240 --> 03:55:07.240]  I appreciate XM picking the show up six days a week.
[03:55:07.240 --> 03:55:12.240]  Be sure and support all our local sponsors as well.
[03:55:12.240 --> 03:55:17.240]  This information is becoming mainstream because we've been here for many years telling the truth.
[03:55:17.240 --> 03:55:19.240]  You've been out there getting the word out. We're having an effect.
[03:55:19.240 --> 03:55:26.240]  Just something fun here at the end of the show after all that serious news in the last three plus hours.
[03:55:26.240 --> 03:55:28.240]  Here's just a short little clip.
[03:55:28.240 --> 03:55:33.240]  The full video is up on YouTube. Somebody sent it to us.
[03:55:33.240 --> 03:55:40.240]  Alex Jones iPad video on CNN with Janie Mose, I guess is how you pronounce her name.
[03:55:40.240 --> 03:55:44.240]  And it's, again, I didn't name this video.
[03:55:44.240 --> 03:55:45.240]  It's not really about me.
[03:55:45.240 --> 03:55:49.240]  I mean, I'm a small part of it, but it shows all of the iPad torture going on.
[03:55:49.240 --> 03:55:52.240]  And we really pioneered the murder of an iPad.
[03:55:52.240 --> 03:55:57.240]  I did it to illustrate that real tortures going on and people don't get upset about humans being tortured,
[03:55:57.240 --> 03:56:00.240]  but they would get upset about an iPad being tortured.
[03:56:00.240 --> 03:56:05.240]  And that scientific test certainly bore out as correct and got hundreds and hundreds,
[03:56:05.240 --> 03:56:07.240]  well over 500,000 views total.
[03:56:07.240 --> 03:56:09.240]  And so it was certainly educational.
[03:56:09.240 --> 03:56:11.240]  But here's CNN covering part of it right now.
[03:56:11.240 --> 03:56:14.240]  Get away with making fun of iProducts.
[03:56:14.240 --> 03:56:17.240]  It's the iPhone Nano.
[03:56:17.240 --> 03:56:21.240]  I understand it's also a breath mint.
[03:56:21.240 --> 03:56:26.240]  And bloggers enjoy torturing products like the iPad.
[03:56:26.240 --> 03:56:28.240]  Answer my questions!
[03:56:28.240 --> 03:56:32.240]  One guy gave it a cigarette in a blindfold, then shot it.
[03:56:32.240 --> 03:56:36.240]  It's been waterboarded, turned into a skateboard.
[03:56:36.240 --> 03:56:38.240]  Not so good.
[03:56:38.240 --> 03:56:42.240]  And even worse, shoved into a blender.
[03:56:42.240 --> 03:56:47.240]  I think I'll press the I blend button.
[03:56:47.240 --> 03:56:48.240]  It didn't work too well.
[03:56:48.240 --> 03:56:50.240]  iPad puree.
[03:56:50.240 --> 03:56:52.240]  Peewee Herman used it as a tray.
[03:56:52.240 --> 03:56:53.240]  Oh, we're out of time.
[03:56:53.240 --> 03:56:55.240]  Letterman licked it.
[03:56:55.240 --> 03:56:56.240]  We're out of time.
[03:56:56.240 --> 03:56:58.240]  Something fun there at the end of the show.
[03:56:58.240 --> 03:57:02.240]  If you want to watch the full three-minute video, it's Alex Jones' iPad video on CNN,
[03:57:02.240 --> 03:57:04.240]  Janie MOOS.
[03:57:04.240 --> 03:57:05.240]  I guess that's a joke.
[03:57:05.240 --> 03:57:07.240]  I forget her real name.
[03:57:07.240 --> 03:57:10.240]  I'll be back Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m. with the abbreviated Sunday Transmission.
[03:57:10.240 --> 03:57:14.240]  We've either got Max Kaiser on Sunday, or we've got him on Monday.
[03:57:14.240 --> 03:57:16.240]  But he'll be on one of those days.
[03:57:16.240 --> 03:57:18.240]  And let's get Tarpoli one of those days then.
[03:57:18.240 --> 03:57:19.240]  Let's get Tarpoli Sunday.
[03:57:19.240 --> 03:57:25.240]  I want to get his angle as an economist on what we just saw happen with the 1,000-point drop yesterday.
[03:57:25.240 --> 03:57:26.240]  This is important.
[03:57:26.240 --> 03:57:27.240]  The market is rigged.
[03:57:27.240 --> 03:57:32.240]  You have a tiny banking elite who are able to buy up the entire planet through fraud
[03:57:32.240 --> 03:57:34.240]  and stock market manipulation.
[03:57:34.240 --> 03:57:36.240]  It is a fact.
[03:57:36.240 --> 03:57:38.240]  And they keep blaming capitalism with this.
[03:57:38.240 --> 03:57:40.240]  They keep saying capitalism has caused this.
[03:57:40.240 --> 03:57:41.240]  This isn't free market.
[03:57:41.240 --> 03:57:44.240]  If I rob my neighbor, that's not capitalism.
[03:57:44.240 --> 03:57:50.240]  Capitalism is free market, is not having high taxes or high regulation.
[03:57:50.240 --> 03:57:56.240]  They're using the big banks, big corporations, use regulation and government control to shut down their competition.
[03:57:56.240 --> 03:57:58.240]  That's what this banking reform bill is.
[03:57:58.240 --> 03:58:01.240]  They don't want the real, audit the Fed reform bill.
[03:58:01.240 --> 03:58:04.240]  No, they want their other bill that Goldman Sachs is supporting.
[03:58:04.240 --> 03:58:11.240]  Remember Barack Obama making jokes last week at the Correspondence Center about this whole event brought to you by Goldman Sachs,
[03:58:11.240 --> 03:58:13.240]  which is true, his campaign was brought to you by them.
[03:58:13.240 --> 03:58:15.240]  And it doesn't matter if you laugh.
[03:58:15.240 --> 03:58:16.240]  They make money anyways.
[03:58:16.240 --> 03:58:18.240]  That's in your face.
[03:58:18.240 --> 03:58:20.240]  Then he made jokes about drones killing people.
[03:58:20.240 --> 03:58:23.240]  And now they've dispatched 1,000 drones to Pakistan.
[03:58:23.240 --> 03:58:29.240]  And it says, no name terrorists, now CIA drone targets, just kill whoever they want.
[03:58:29.240 --> 03:58:30.240]  This is illegal.
[03:58:30.240 --> 03:58:32.240]  And they want to use this against the American people.
[03:58:32.240 --> 03:58:37.240]  They're trying to pass bills right now to be able to arrest you and take your rights away as a citizen.
[03:58:37.240 --> 03:58:38.240]  Great job, Cruz.
[03:58:38.240 --> 03:58:39.240]  See you back Sunday and Monday.
[03:58:39.240 --> 03:58:40.240]  God bless you all.
[03:58:40.240 --> 03:59:04.240]  And guys, best of starts now.
