[00:00.000 --> 00:12.400]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.400 --> 00:20.880]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex
[00:20.880 --> 00:34.560]  jones all men 18 to 44 now the us code 18 to 49 are members of the militia and I
[00:34.560 --> 00:39.280]  believe all able-bodied men should own rifles handgun firearms like they've
[00:39.280 --> 00:42.800]  always done in the Netherlands now they're restricting that Switzerland and
[00:42.800 --> 00:46.680]  of course where we adopted their models really out of the Dutch founding New
[00:46.680 --> 00:52.280]  York that was one of the biggest cultural histories that the founders drew
[00:52.280 --> 00:58.720]  on and of course was part of the culture of the colonies before that that the
[00:58.720 --> 01:02.880]  men and the women for that matter be armed to protect their counties their
[01:02.880 --> 01:08.760]  cities their towns their hamlets but now we've seen a demonization of the
[01:08.760 --> 01:11.800]  Second Amendment culture where we try to put a rifle and a rifle rack even in
[01:11.800 --> 01:17.440]  Wyoming or Texas cops will pull you over nine times out of ten run up and a lot
[01:17.440 --> 01:20.320]  of times point guns at you pull you out on the ground put you down because the
[01:20.320 --> 01:25.080]  public sees a gun they panic oh my gosh there's a slave with a gun the TV
[01:25.080 --> 01:28.780]  dramas are almost all based in Chicago and New York all these different TV
[01:28.780 --> 01:33.400]  programs fiction they show people being busted with guns and handguns and rifles
[01:33.400 --> 01:36.760]  and their houses or cars they're always a criminal so the message is you're a
[01:36.760 --> 01:40.880]  criminal they always have drugs or something with it you have drugs you
[01:40.880 --> 01:44.360]  know you are a child molester you are a cop killer if you own a gun it's
[01:44.360 --> 01:49.760]  programming and the message that guns are illegal to begin with and a caller
[01:49.760 --> 01:53.880]  called him an example of you know NFL on Sunday on Fox and they were even having
[01:53.880 --> 01:58.720]  anti-gun messages in there and I pulled it up sure enough last night it was
[01:58.720 --> 02:01.960]  there demonizing all these football players were always getting caught with
[02:01.960 --> 02:08.240]  guns they're wealthy so what they got something to protect so what the point
[02:08.240 --> 02:11.360]  is and maybe even some of our gang members and thuggish don't take my
[02:11.360 --> 02:17.480]  rights because of them but for those of you that don't want to go join one of
[02:17.480 --> 02:20.120]  the active militias and I will tell you it's dangerous because they're
[02:20.120 --> 02:23.680]  infiltrated with feds they try to provocateur you never be around anybody
[02:23.680 --> 02:27.280]  who says we ought to carry out an attack we ought to get violent we ought to do
[02:27.280 --> 02:29.960]  this they'll wait till you're having a beer or something after you've been
[02:29.960 --> 02:34.880]  training that that's a fed folks they're normally the leader they'll even found
[02:34.880 --> 02:39.080]  groups to do this and I've seen a lot of folks go to prison don't be the best
[02:39.080 --> 02:45.680]  thing to do is say hey we're a we're a local shooter club we're a neighborhood
[02:45.680 --> 02:49.440]  defense deal you know we're just training for the fence of our homes we're
[02:49.440 --> 02:57.080]  a you know gunsmith club and yeah we like to go out and you know train its
[02:57.080 --> 03:03.840]  exercise and then anybody that comes in and calls for violence just go to their
[03:03.840 --> 03:08.320]  car so get out of here write down their plates get in your car follow them it's
[03:08.320 --> 03:12.480]  a fed or it's a local state police operative and then you go and you call
[03:12.480 --> 03:17.480]  the media you call the news this is how we counter strike them you call the
[03:17.480 --> 03:20.840]  media you give me didn't cover you go on access TV you call them to talk radio
[03:20.840 --> 03:27.240]  shows and you you say hey this cop came he tried to get me to do violence and
[03:27.240 --> 03:30.040]  there's lots of counterstinks happening all over the country it's very very
[03:30.040 --> 03:34.600]  exciting that's one of the things that really made him go for the militias in
[03:34.600 --> 03:38.320]  the early 1990s remember now Alabama was a good old boy roundup with more than
[03:38.320 --> 03:46.160]  5,000 FBI VATF they were telling selling inward hunting licenses and hanging
[03:46.160 --> 03:50.080]  blacks and effigy remember that went on 60 minutes boy they went for the militia
[03:50.080 --> 03:57.200]  hardcore after that so there's a lot we can do to them as well so this is the
[03:57.200 --> 04:02.520]  model anybody that tells you militia it's secret meet me to dig up guns meet
[04:02.520 --> 04:06.880]  me you know do some covert ops it's a fed folks or it's a schizophrenic
[04:06.880 --> 04:11.080]  mentally unstable we're the good guys we're the patriots we're out in the
[04:11.080 --> 04:15.040]  open it's our second amendment and we have to bring our guns out in public
[04:15.040 --> 04:19.200]  show everybody bring our culture back not let them act like it's some porno
[04:19.200 --> 04:22.360]  movie you bought on the side of the highway at some shop that you put in a
[04:22.360 --> 04:28.000]  black bag and sneak out to your car with they have made gun owners get in the
[04:28.000 --> 04:32.360]  closet while the globalist and their tyranny and their social engineering is

[07:59.680 --> 08:07.840]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[08:19.480 --> 08:23.840]  I've got some big breaking news that just developed here in the office but
[08:23.840 --> 08:29.920]  we're gonna cover it after this current guest leave us in about an hour and 20
[08:29.920 --> 08:36.480]  minutes from now so stay tuned for that Sam Dame would I heard him on Derry
[08:36.480 --> 08:39.840]  Brownfield a few weeks ago really wanted to get him on 26 year active duty
[08:39.840 --> 08:43.520]  military veteran from Erie Pennsylvania gunsmith lifelong student of American
[08:43.520 --> 08:50.120]  history and a crack rifleman currently living in Alamogordo New Mexico and we're
[08:50.120 --> 08:56.400]  going to talk about constitutional history the militias and this apple seed
[08:56.400 --> 09:01.400]  movement that's got tens of thousands of people out training to be riflemen to
[09:01.400 --> 09:06.120]  to try to bring life back to the true heritage of a country that is a gun
[09:06.120 --> 09:11.720]  culture to its very core remember a few years ago a head professor up in
[09:11.720 --> 09:16.080]  Chicago wrote a book saying that it was an anti-gun culture and 99% didn't own
[09:16.080 --> 09:20.920]  guns he was kicked off he lost his tenure turned out he lied he falsified
[09:20.920 --> 09:24.120]  everything well we already knew that the point is they are attacking this
[09:24.120 --> 09:29.680]  culture they say you're evil you're bad you're a redneck that it's you know a
[09:29.680 --> 09:33.640]  false appendage all of this stuff you want to go no we want to be sovereign we
[09:33.640 --> 09:37.400]  don't want to be slaves we don't want to be like China and Russia and other
[09:37.400 --> 09:41.040]  countries in Mexico where they've been disarmed and made to be slaves the second
[09:41.040 --> 09:45.640]  amendment is the key and the dual key is the first amendment all of these are
[09:45.640 --> 09:51.880]  under attack and so we'll also talk about apple seed info org the apple seed
[09:51.880 --> 09:56.000]  project as well and take your phone calls coming up to about 45 minutes but
[09:56.000 --> 10:00.640]  I want to talk first at link to our guests because I've probably read I
[10:00.640 --> 10:05.840]  don't know 1520 big books on Revolutionary War itself a lot quite a few
[10:05.840 --> 10:10.600]  books on the pre-war I read out Alexander de Tocqueville's book came out
[10:10.600 --> 10:14.320]  about 10 years after the war you know where he went around the colonies now
[10:14.320 --> 10:17.800]  the United States and was was just amazed by the ingenuity the intelligence
[10:17.800 --> 10:22.120]  the the educational level of folks living in log cabins that just the most
[10:22.120 --> 10:26.000]  amazing people he'd ever seen he'd been all over Europe and then how we've turned
[10:26.000 --> 10:30.280]  into what we are now how we get back what we were this incredible heritage and
[10:30.280 --> 10:35.720]  then go forward from there so it's really great to have to have Sam
[10:35.720 --> 10:40.120]  Damewood all of the Sam it is wonderful to have you here thank you thank you
[10:40.120 --> 10:44.680]  very much Alex I appreciate you inviting me on your show today for folks that
[10:44.680 --> 10:49.040]  don't know who you are a little bit more about yourself and then you know how
[10:49.040 --> 10:52.960]  you got involved in apple seed what it is briefly then we're gonna get into what
[10:52.960 --> 10:58.400]  this country really is about well Alex I'm really just an ordinary person here
[10:58.400 --> 11:03.720]  in America I I was born in the late 50s grew up with all of the fine American
[11:03.720 --> 11:08.800]  values that we had in the 60s was taught to be a decent human being by my
[11:08.800 --> 11:14.880]  parents joined the military I spent most of my adult life with them when I
[11:14.880 --> 11:19.800]  retired I came out into gunsmithing and a couple of years ago a friend of mine
[11:19.800 --> 11:24.040]  put me on to the apple seed people he said this is something you really need
[11:24.040 --> 11:30.680]  to get into and I looked at them checked them out I went and participated in an
[11:30.680 --> 11:35.240]  apple seed shoot and I said these people have something that I really need to be
[11:35.240 --> 11:41.200]  part of they've got the message they know where America's from they have those
[11:41.200 --> 11:45.640]  values that we all appreciated and that we grew up hearing about when we were
[11:45.640 --> 11:50.080]  children and that's how I got involved with apple seed and it just took off
[11:50.080 --> 11:56.880]  from there and you're an instructor with apple seed now yeah break it down for
[11:56.880 --> 12:02.120]  folks what this country's really about and why the globalist want to remove our
[12:02.120 --> 12:09.440]  heritage let's break it down well I'm not really sure why the globalist want
[12:09.440 --> 12:16.480]  to remove it but over the past 200 years we've we've deviated a lot from the
[12:16.480 --> 12:22.880]  principles that we've read about from our founding fathers and apple seed just
[12:22.880 --> 12:27.960]  put me back on track it just told me where I needed to go to to get back with
[12:27.960 --> 12:34.360]  those those values and and those things that our country was founded on our love
[12:34.360 --> 12:39.720]  for freedom and I believe there are people in the world that just can't
[12:39.720 --> 12:44.640]  deal with freedom here in America we're founded on freedom and and apple seeds
[12:44.640 --> 12:51.400]  the best way I've seen to maintain it so I stuck with him briefly describe
[12:51.400 --> 12:56.600]  apple seed and then let's get into some of those great stories you were telling
[12:56.600 --> 13:00.880]  many of which I was familiar with but I love the way you were telling them let's
[13:00.880 --> 13:06.280]  spend some time on the spirit of the rifleman you know 70 plus year old men
[13:06.280 --> 13:12.640]  fighting the red coats I mean I just people need to hear that sure you know
[13:12.640 --> 13:19.280]  in apple seed we we introduced to our shooters a lot of the history that went
[13:19.280 --> 13:23.400]  with Lexington and Concord in the background behind them so that they
[13:23.400 --> 13:28.120]  can appreciate what it took for our founding fathers to break away from
[13:28.120 --> 13:35.520]  England and in amongst the the shooting instruction we tell the story of what we
[13:35.520 --> 13:40.680]  call the three strikes what's started the Revolutionary War and how it got
[13:40.680 --> 13:46.560]  going and we offer very good shooting instruction in the process but when
[13:46.560 --> 13:51.440]  people are listening to the history it it brings tears to their eyes because the
[13:51.440 --> 13:55.040]  older people are familiar with it and the youngsters have never heard it it's
[13:55.040 --> 14:01.280]  not taught in the schools today we teach the nation's heritage as riflemen how
[14:01.280 --> 14:04.800]  the people plan to take care of themselves they were self-reliant in
[14:04.800 --> 14:11.000]  those days and and looked out for each other they just wanted freedom and they
[14:11.000 --> 14:17.280]  planned for it and they carried it out and apple seed brings back that
[14:17.280 --> 14:21.960]  heritage as a nation of riflemen to America and introduces people to the
[14:21.960 --> 14:28.080]  history of the founding and how we got going and I guess we really should start
[14:28.080 --> 14:32.040]  with with back at that Lexington and Concord like we like to teach it in
[14:32.040 --> 14:39.720]  apple seed on the 18th of April of 1775 General Gage was the British
[14:39.720 --> 14:45.120]  commander in Boston and the cities of Boston in New York had been occupied by
[14:45.120 --> 14:52.600]  the British military for almost ten years at that point in retaliation for
[14:52.600 --> 14:58.760]  actions we'd taken against the first Stamp Act in 1763 the people rebelled
[14:58.760 --> 15:03.400]  against it they felt that they were being unfairly taxed for a purpose that
[15:03.400 --> 15:08.040]  they didn't care for they weren't consulted in it and Parliament had never
[15:08.040 --> 15:14.880]  before tried to control the colony or attacks them with the mounting debt that
[15:14.880 --> 15:20.200]  the big government will always bring the Parliament was in huge debt from the
[15:20.200 --> 15:28.120]  French from the French American front excuse me in the seven years war
[15:28.120 --> 15:33.160]  French and Indian war as we call it and they wanted to recoup that so they
[15:33.160 --> 15:38.960]  passed the Stamp Act and the Revenue Act to try and raise money to pay that off
[15:38.960 --> 15:44.520]  the colony is objected they objected so strongly that the British then in over
[15:44.520 --> 15:50.280]  10,000 troops occupy the country and when we refused to pay to quarter those
[15:50.280 --> 15:58.000]  troops they sent in more occupied New York specifically to punish them along
[15:58.000 --> 16:02.240]  with those taxes they started passing what were known as rifts of assistance
[16:02.240 --> 16:06.640]  which were general search warrants that allowed the British to search anywhere
[16:06.640 --> 16:11.280]  they wanted or contraband that have been smuggled in and violation of those
[16:11.280 --> 16:17.640]  taxes and Americans were pretty creative as smugglers in those days as some of
[16:17.640 --> 16:22.840]  them still are and the British just couldn't keep up with it in any way shape
[16:22.840 --> 16:30.880]  or form as the British government became more and more oppressive to America the
[16:30.880 --> 16:37.080]  the colonists took action to protect themselves and they formed committees of
[16:37.080 --> 16:42.800]  correspondence to pass information back and forth between the colonies so that
[16:42.800 --> 16:47.240]  everyone could keep abreast of the latest news what oppressions and evils
[16:47.240 --> 16:57.360]  were being done one of the people that we hear a lot about Paul revere was
[16:57.360 --> 17:01.280]  primarily a messenger for the committee of correspondence of Massachusetts
[17:01.280 --> 17:06.960]  colony and he was widely respected known to people all over the nation because
[17:06.960 --> 17:11.240]  he carried the messages back and forth he made a a series of journeys south
[17:11.240 --> 17:17.880]  carrying news from the committees of correspondence as the oppression became
[17:17.880 --> 17:25.880]  more and more intolerable the people knew that they were going to have issues
[17:25.880 --> 17:32.960]  the British had taken the government of Massachusetts colony and thrown it out
[17:32.960 --> 17:37.200]  they said you no longer have the right to govern yourself will appoint the
[17:37.200 --> 17:42.320]  courts will appoint the representatives will tell you everything to do the
[17:42.320 --> 17:48.080]  people of Massachusetts were very brilliant they ignored the British when
[17:48.080 --> 17:52.440]  the British tried to have a court sit people didn't come for jury duty when
[17:52.440 --> 17:56.040]  the British tried to have an assembly and and vote on things get things done
[17:56.040 --> 18:00.600]  people ignored what they said and did they held their own town meetings and
[18:00.600 --> 18:07.080]  continued to rule themselves the British were highly intolerant of that and as
[18:07.080 --> 18:13.080]  things came to a head in late 1774 the British started to become more and more
[18:13.080 --> 18:16.440]  aggressive in trying to control the colony now let's stop there we're going
[18:16.440 --> 18:20.160]  to break in a moment and come back and go through this but as you list what
[18:20.160 --> 18:23.360]  you're listing it was later put the Declaration of Independence they've now
[18:23.360 --> 18:27.560]  announced North com 20,000 streets for the streets of America for civil
[18:27.560 --> 18:31.680]  insurrection that the governors will serve at the pleasure of the president
[18:31.680 --> 18:36.680]  as dual-headed military officers same thing the British did we've created all
[18:36.680 --> 18:41.960]  these new courts family courts federal bureaucracies regional courts that
[18:41.960 --> 18:47.680]  aren't even real courts for tribunals all the same forms of tyranny are now
[18:47.680 --> 18:51.840]  being used the blank FISA warrants that's not even good enough for now they
[18:51.840 --> 18:55.480]  just don't have warrants they're using the Patriot Act in non-terror related
[18:55.480 --> 19:00.680]  cases so we see literally a mirror image and and quartering of troops that also
[19:00.680 --> 19:05.920]  make troops in the streets troops at checkpoints at street corners now we're
[19:05.920 --> 19:11.160]  hearing this is happening and I had a judge advocate Colonel on last week is
[19:11.160 --> 19:14.920]  a Republican saying this is horrible it's all over the news that what we're
[19:14.920 --> 19:19.360]  hearing is totally illegal so we see a dovetailing here with what our founders
[19:19.360 --> 19:22.960]  went through and what we're going through in the good news here is they
[19:22.960 --> 19:26.840]  were occupied as you say for more than a decade before they finally physically
[19:26.840 --> 19:31.240]  fought back so folks this is gonna be a long hard fight and that's separate from
[19:31.240 --> 19:35.880]  Apple seed and the rest of it the point is is that it was the publishers many of
[19:35.880 --> 19:39.280]  them many of the founding fathers were publishers and they finally tried to
[19:39.280 --> 19:42.520]  stop them publishing their newspapers so they'd go underground then they would
[19:42.520 --> 19:46.480]  arrest them then the people would rebel seeing that tyranny we're gonna go
[19:46.480 --> 19:50.840]  through the same thing a lot of us won't make it through this but in the end
[19:50.840 --> 19:57.160]  the Republic will be restored they'll be right back with our guest stay with us

[24:35.920 --> 24:44.640]  tyranny today just want to move forward into 1775 yes Alex obviously in
[24:44.640 --> 24:49.240]  response to that government oppression the colonists felt a need to prepare
[24:49.240 --> 24:54.320]  they prepared in many ways they developed their own information networks
[24:54.320 --> 24:58.200]  with the committees of correspondence and they paid attention to what was
[24:58.200 --> 25:03.600]  going on with the government they created several organizations there were
[25:03.600 --> 25:09.720]  seven or eight in Boston alone and it's remarkable that of all of those lists
[25:09.720 --> 25:14.400]  of the main ones there were only two people that were on more than three of
[25:14.400 --> 25:21.160]  those lists of organization one of them was Paul Revere who we all know from his
[25:21.160 --> 25:29.560]  famous ride which the poets have sort of misrepresented to us but in their
[25:29.560 --> 25:35.400]  preparation they had decided they needed the arm and they had maintained
[25:35.400 --> 25:42.280]  stocks of of arms all throughout the colony Lexington and Concord had them
[25:42.280 --> 25:47.720]  and the very first action it was taken by the British government was something
[25:47.720 --> 25:53.320]  called the powder alarms in our history where the British went and attempted to
[25:53.320 --> 25:58.840]  remove the stocks of gunpowder from the colonists the colonists took this as a
[25:58.840 --> 26:03.960]  as a signal of the government was taking action against them and they stepped
[26:03.960 --> 26:10.240]  up their training and organization there had always been militia in the
[26:10.240 --> 26:14.440]  colony people need to band together to protect themselves first from
[26:14.440 --> 26:18.880]  depredations of Indians and criminals and from the French during the French and
[26:18.880 --> 26:26.360]  Indian War but the militia is as many people know it is the incorrect picture
[26:26.360 --> 26:32.840]  it's a body of many kinds of citizens but not minute men like we all like to
[26:32.840 --> 26:37.600]  think of there were in fact minute men and the colony of Massachusetts had
[26:37.600 --> 26:42.120]  agreed that they should field some companies of minute men who were a
[26:42.120 --> 26:48.160]  quick response force but there were two other bands that were very important in
[26:48.160 --> 26:53.640]  this entire process one of them was called the alarm band and the alarm
[26:53.640 --> 26:58.960]  band were the people that sounded the alarm when when danger was detected
[26:58.960 --> 27:04.600]  Paul Revere was one of the people that passed that information to them and we
[27:04.600 --> 27:07.800]  think of Paul Revere running off alone to tell the world but there were actually
[27:07.800 --> 27:15.600]  a whole group of supporters that helped him in this endeavor we had spies in the
[27:15.600 --> 27:21.560]  in the British Army keeping track of them and it was through one of those
[27:21.560 --> 27:25.480]  spies that we learned that the British were going to be coming up to
[27:25.480 --> 27:29.400]  Lexington and Concord to seize weapons and they routinely would kill they would
[27:29.400 --> 27:35.000]  hang those spies this was also very very dangerous yes it was what was
[27:35.000 --> 27:40.800]  unusual in this and like most spies it's hard to tell who they really are but it
[27:40.800 --> 27:45.920]  appears that the spy in the enemy camp for us on April 18th was a woman named
[27:45.920 --> 27:50.680]  Margaret Kimball Gage who was the wife of the British General Gage the
[27:50.680 --> 27:55.720]  commander in Boston she was a good American lady from New York and had
[27:55.720 --> 28:00.800]  trouble with divided loyalties she wanted America to succeed and prosper on
[28:00.800 --> 28:05.560]  its own without British intervention and as far as we know she's the person that
[28:05.560 --> 28:11.880]  told us that they were coming so the word went out through several people it
[28:11.880 --> 28:15.600]  took three people to get those lanterns up in the in the Old North Church to give
[28:15.600 --> 28:23.000]  the signal and Revere Dawes and several others went on their way to go out and
[28:23.000 --> 28:29.720]  pass the word that the regulars were coming they didn't ride up and down
[28:29.720 --> 28:33.800]  the road yelling the British are coming and that's very important because they
[28:33.800 --> 28:37.600]  didn't think of the British as separate people they thought of themselves as
[28:37.600 --> 28:40.960]  loyal British citizens yeah they didn't say the redcoats are coming they said
[28:40.960 --> 28:43.840]  the British were coming and they were telling the government to treat them
[28:43.840 --> 28:47.800]  the same as British citizens or subjects as they had been they weren't being
[28:47.800 --> 28:52.640]  treated like that right they said the regulars were coming because they all
[28:52.640 --> 28:58.240]  considered themselves to be British citizens in any case Revere and the
[28:58.240 --> 29:04.000]  others went about their alarm to pass the word to everyone and Revere's
[29:04.000 --> 29:07.600]  initial mission was to get the Lexington and pass the word because it was thought
[29:07.600 --> 29:17.520]  that the British were trying to capture John Hancock and John Adams and that
[29:17.520 --> 29:23.800]  wasn't actually the case they were going for for the guns in Concord but Revere
[29:23.800 --> 29:28.120]  went to went to Lexington pass the word to Hancock and Adams so they could get
[29:28.120 --> 29:32.440]  out because it was thought that they were targeted they were the only rebels in
[29:32.440 --> 29:36.480]  Massachusetts who had not been offered amnesty they'll be right back stay there

[33:57.520 --> 34:03.280]  want to tell some of those amazing stories okay Alec Revere went on his
[34:03.280 --> 34:07.600]  ride and he was actually stopped and captured by the British on the way by a
[34:07.600 --> 34:13.640]  British named a major by the name of Mitchell they interrogated him held a
[34:13.640 --> 34:21.000]  pistol to his head asked him what was going on and in a great line of misdirection
[34:21.000 --> 34:26.320]  he told him that in Lexington he was going to meet 500 men on the parade
[34:26.320 --> 34:32.280]  ground in the town square and as they hang around in that position that patrol
[34:32.280 --> 34:39.720]  with dead men major Mitchell was pretty hot headed and he'd already gotten upset
[34:39.720 --> 34:45.200]  and hurt a couple of people that day over it he took Revere's horse and turned
[34:45.200 --> 34:49.920]  him loose on foot and headed back to warn the army with an exaggerated version
[34:49.920 --> 34:57.640]  of the perceived danger Revere went back to Lexington at 430 the militia had
[34:57.640 --> 35:03.360]  already been called out informed and released at least one time at that
[35:03.360 --> 35:07.240]  point they were hanging around in a place called Buckman's Tavern which still
[35:07.240 --> 35:14.680]  stands today the captain Parker in charge of the militia in Lexington had
[35:14.680 --> 35:20.880]  sent out two scouts to find out about the status of the British and one scout
[35:20.880 --> 35:27.360]  returned and said there was no danger about the time of Revere got back and
[35:27.360 --> 35:31.600]  other scout returned with news that the British were only 15 minutes from town
[35:31.600 --> 35:36.000]  he'd found them a little bit earlier but he got trapped in a road behind them
[35:36.000 --> 35:42.920]  captain Parker had the drummers found assembly to bring the militia back up
[35:42.920 --> 35:47.640]  to the to the common the town square which is a park in the middle of town
[35:47.640 --> 35:52.640]  where the militia would muster and do their training let's stop right there
[35:52.640 --> 35:56.240]  and then continue in a moment what type of men made up the militia we know
[35:56.240 --> 36:01.040]  there were silver smiths and black smiths and we know there were doctors
[36:01.040 --> 36:05.000]  there were pastors there were preachers but predominantly these a lot of them
[36:05.000 --> 36:11.840]  were veterans of multiple conflicts the war with the French that a different
[36:11.840 --> 36:17.480]  wars of different tribes oh yes a lot of these men had had military experience
[36:17.480 --> 36:23.360]  during the French and Indian War and had been working along dealing with the
[36:23.360 --> 36:28.120]  Indian attacks all along through their entire life the American continent was
[36:28.120 --> 36:33.280]  not a quiet and peaceful place for the most part and that's one of the reasons
[36:33.280 --> 36:36.360]  why they kept up their militia and did their training because there was always
[36:36.360 --> 36:45.640]  a threat of some kind there were farmers doctors lawyers insurance salesmen every
[36:45.640 --> 36:50.520]  occupation that you can think of Revere was a silversmith one of the captains
[36:50.520 --> 36:56.640]  of militia was a black smith from the town of Acton by the name of Isaac Davis
[36:56.640 --> 37:02.080]  he was particularly adamant about having his people trained besides being a
[37:02.080 --> 37:08.000]  black smith he was a gunsmith which is a profession dear to my heart and he had
[37:08.000 --> 37:13.000]  his people trained by firing behind his shop and he went to considerable
[37:13.000 --> 37:17.080]  personal expense to make sure that his people were outfitted with what was at
[37:17.080 --> 37:21.800]  that time the latest available gear they all actually had ammunition boxes and
[37:21.800 --> 37:26.920]  bayonets which most of the militia did not but there were farmers shopkeepers
[37:26.920 --> 37:33.840]  doctors clergymen many of the people who were in the alarm band were doctors
[37:33.840 --> 37:37.440]  because doctors did a lot of traveling in those days and they knew their way
[37:37.440 --> 37:42.280]  around in the dark they could find their way from one town to another same way
[37:42.280 --> 37:48.520]  with pastors given the type of life that they had a lot of their life centered
[37:48.520 --> 37:52.720]  around the church in those days and the militia was a very democratic
[37:52.720 --> 37:58.640]  organization they voted in their officers and NCOs and they actually
[37:58.640 --> 38:03.640]  consulted before they did anything they often would consult with their pastor
[38:03.640 --> 38:09.320]  who was an integral part of the unit there was one old pastor took part in
[38:09.320 --> 38:14.520]  in the in the festivities on April 19th 80 years old who walked all of them into
[38:14.520 --> 38:19.960]  the ground he was that adamant to be part of the the organization and go out
[38:19.960 --> 38:24.720]  and then meanwhile while this is going way to the south in the Carolinas you
[38:24.720 --> 38:28.480]  have at this time what he's a 10 or 11 years old as it's all about the start
[38:28.480 --> 38:31.480]  and his mother and brother died in a British concentration camp they
[38:31.480 --> 38:34.320]  actually invented them and that of course was Andrew Jackson who wouldn't
[38:34.320 --> 38:38.080]  clean the boots of one of the British officers that's the famous scar across
[38:38.080 --> 38:42.680]  his face so also in this war a lot of amazing people were developed but now
[38:42.680 --> 38:46.600]  let's continue back with there's a British force coming where they are
[38:46.600 --> 38:53.560]  what happens right the British force marched on Lexington and the lead unit
[38:53.560 --> 38:59.160]  was about 250 men out of a total of 800 who was led by a young lieutenant named
[38:59.160 --> 39:04.200]  a Jesse a dare he saw the militia gathered on the green and led his unit
[39:04.200 --> 39:10.720]  off the main road from Concord taking a fork up to the to the green to confront
[39:10.720 --> 39:16.400]  the militia before before the officers in the rear could stop him captain Parker
[39:16.400 --> 39:21.920]  head of the militia in Lexington saw this and began his moving his men back the
[39:21.920 --> 39:25.200]  British unit lined themselves up in a battle formation in front of them and
[39:25.200 --> 39:29.560]  shouted their battle cry which was so loud that many of their own officers
[39:29.560 --> 39:37.000]  were deafened couldn't hear it very well captain Parker had approximately 70 men
[39:37.000 --> 39:41.280]  mustard on the green two of them were strangers from out of town that were
[39:41.280 --> 39:46.720]  recruited on the spot will you stand with us and they did Parker lined
[39:46.720 --> 39:53.080]  everybody up and told them stand their ground with a famous pretty famous quote
[39:53.080 --> 39:57.240]  stand your ground don't fire unless fired upon but if they want to have a war
[39:57.240 --> 40:03.000]  let it begin here that sounds pretty aggressive but actually they were still
[40:03.000 --> 40:09.200]  in a very defensive mode do not fire unless fired upon the head British
[40:09.200 --> 40:14.640]  Marine in that contingent by the name of pit care and rode up on his horse with
[40:14.640 --> 40:17.920]  four other British officers and told them to lay down your arms you damned
[40:17.920 --> 40:24.440]  rebels and Parker actually ordered his men to disperse and they started to back
[40:24.440 --> 40:30.480]  off of the green in pretty good order somebody fired a shot at that point and
[40:30.480 --> 40:33.280]  a lot of evidence shows it's the British plus these are battle hardened
[40:33.280 --> 40:37.440]  troops from wars all over the world they're there they see people getting
[40:37.440 --> 40:42.720]  ready to back off and so they go okay let's go ahead and take a shot right
[40:42.720 --> 40:48.680]  well it was in pretty good agreement from all the statements afterward that not
[40:48.680 --> 40:54.960]  one of the regulars the British regulars in the formation fired a shot to begin
[40:54.960 --> 41:00.080]  with and none of the militia people fired a shot but there was a major pit
[41:00.080 --> 41:05.560]  caring and four British officers on horseback at the head of the formation
[41:05.560 --> 41:09.680]  and one of them was a Lieutenant William Sutherland who was well known as a
[41:09.680 --> 41:15.440]  hothead and had been speaking rather harshly of colonists all day long and
[41:15.440 --> 41:19.680]  it's thought that he's the one that actually fired the first shot from his
[41:19.680 --> 41:23.800]  pistol most of the people agreed that it sounded like the first shot came from a
[41:23.800 --> 41:28.480]  pistol and did not come from the British line but after that first shot was
[41:28.480 --> 41:38.360]  fired the British regulars began to fire the militiamen were pretty much
[41:38.360 --> 41:42.560]  amazed they hadn't planned on being fired on at this point they were dispersing
[41:42.560 --> 41:46.520]  retreating off the green the regulars opened fire without orders and the
[41:46.520 --> 41:52.320]  officers couldn't control them they tried everything they could but it didn't
[41:52.320 --> 41:57.000]  happen the young guys ran away several of the older ones were determined to
[41:57.000 --> 42:04.920]  fight back and one of them Jonas Parker said he would never run and he was
[42:04.920 --> 42:10.480]  shot down on the spot while he was trying to reload his rifle he was
[42:10.480 --> 42:15.120]  bayoneted another one that was killed was Ebenezer Monroe we thought there was
[42:15.120 --> 42:19.920]  no chance to escape so he might as well fire back only two of the militiamen
[42:19.920 --> 42:23.400]  fell dead on the line where they were mustered that was Jonas Parker and
[42:23.400 --> 42:27.960]  Robert Monroe the rest were killed while following the order to disperse
[42:27.960 --> 42:34.200]  Jonathan Harrington who was probably the father of the Pfeiffer fell with the
[42:34.200 --> 42:38.640]  gaping chest wound only yards from his home and died on his own doorstep while
[42:38.640 --> 42:46.120]  his wife and son watch seven militiamen were killed and nine were wounded a
[42:46.120 --> 42:50.120]  prisoner who the British had captured earlier was also killed reportedly he
[42:50.120 --> 42:54.560]  was told he could leave then he was shot in the back as he ran away only one
[42:54.560 --> 42:58.000]  regular was wounded now let's be clear the regulars have been beating people up
[42:58.000 --> 43:03.720]  and interrogating and torturing people on their way that was ongoing so they
[43:03.720 --> 43:08.880]  weren't a friendly lot well they weren't friendly they didn't go out of their way
[43:08.880 --> 43:13.280]  to hunt people down and molest them along the way but they had regular
[43:13.280 --> 43:17.280]  patrols out there to stop the alarm word from getting through and they had been
[43:17.280 --> 43:22.080]  stopping citizens and threatening and interrogating them all all the time
[43:22.080 --> 43:26.880]  during the march all evening long because just about everybody on the road
[43:26.880 --> 43:32.760]  at that time was one of the messengers they had taken a good swipe with a sword
[43:32.760 --> 43:38.840]  at one fellow earlier on in the day and the alarm list had done their job the
[43:38.840 --> 43:43.480]  organization was getting the word out there were alarm guns which were gun
[43:43.480 --> 43:49.320]  shots fired in a pattern to signal people and church bells ringing all over
[43:49.320 --> 43:54.320]  Middlesex that entire area of Massachusetts was was alarmed and told
[43:54.320 --> 43:58.360]  what was going on and the British had been trying to control that information
[43:58.360 --> 44:04.880]  flow all through the night as they marched on their way
[44:05.320 --> 44:12.000]  it about well with only one regular wounded it was kind of surprising because
[44:12.000 --> 44:17.600]  the various militias shot pretty well so it's pretty convincing who fired that
[44:17.600 --> 44:22.360]  first shot and it was a British man no way to to get around that like I say
[44:22.360 --> 44:26.400]  they think it was Lieutenant Sutherland he was called into General Gage later
[44:26.400 --> 44:32.200]  to to explain his actions of that day it was never admitted that he fired the
[44:32.200 --> 44:35.920]  first shot but he's the biggest suspect
[44:36.640 --> 44:40.640]  okay continuing with what unfolded that day in the next few days and then what
[44:40.640 --> 44:46.880]  it led to and some of the interesting characters heroes of the fights okay
[44:46.880 --> 44:53.920]  well after remember these are common people who are out they're out just
[44:53.920 --> 44:58.680]  doing their day-to-day job and suddenly they're they're warned by the alarm
[44:58.680 --> 45:03.800]  guns and bells that that the regulars are coming out obviously not to do them
[45:03.800 --> 45:11.680]  any good you know we had some amazing people in in all of this one of them
[45:11.680 --> 45:16.120]  that that like I say his dear to my heart was Isaac Davis who's a militia
[45:16.120 --> 45:24.000]  captain from Acton who had well trained his troops and he marched his troops to
[45:24.000 --> 45:30.040]  Concord and at Concord he was in the van when the shooting started there at the
[45:30.040 --> 45:34.760]  bridge and it's interesting to know by the van he was in the front in the front
[45:34.760 --> 45:40.000]  in the front of the group he was chosen because his troops were the most well
[45:40.000 --> 45:44.160]  equipped and well trained and it was widely recognized and at this time the
[45:44.160 --> 45:47.840]  British are regulars are running around comp trying to confiscate firearms and
[45:47.840 --> 45:52.720]  cannons and powder and things of that nature please continue yes when the
[45:52.720 --> 45:58.480]  British got into Concord they went out to a to a farm that was operated by a
[45:58.480 --> 46:06.120]  militia Colonel Colonel Barrett and it was heard that all of the guns and
[46:06.120 --> 46:10.800]  cannon had been moved to his farm and stashed there so the British split their
[46:10.800 --> 46:15.880]  forces secured the bridges in Concord and sent a party of men to Colonel Barrett's
[46:15.880 --> 46:21.640]  farm so they could tease the guns while part of the militia stayed behind or
[46:21.640 --> 46:26.560]  British stayed behind in Concord to search through the town and they spent
[46:26.560 --> 46:33.800]  all morning searching through the town and finally Major Pitcairn had to break
[46:33.800 --> 46:38.800]  into a the inn in Concord threatened to shoot the innkeeper because he wouldn't
[46:38.800 --> 46:43.040]  open the door got in and held him at gunpoint and told him he was going to
[46:43.040 --> 46:46.120]  blow his brains out if he didn't tell him where the guns were
[46:46.120 --> 46:50.560]  unfortunately the innkeeper knew where the guns were and he led them to 324
[46:50.560 --> 46:55.320]  pounder cannon with the British destroyed they busted the carriages up and
[46:55.320 --> 46:59.880]  tore the trunnions off they found a bunch of musket balls that they threw in a
[46:59.880 --> 47:05.880]  pond they destroyed flour a bunch of wooden spoons and trenches and they cut
[47:05.880 --> 47:10.560]  down the town Liberty Pole which was the signpost where people would meet to
[47:10.560 --> 47:16.080]  exchange news and post broadside flyers sons of Liberty meeting place yes
[47:16.080 --> 47:22.840]  basically it was and they started a fire with all of that wood and in the
[47:22.840 --> 47:27.480]  process the fire got away from them and set the town the light what's most
[47:27.480 --> 47:30.840]  interesting is that the troops stopped their business the colonists stopped
[47:30.840 --> 47:34.400]  theirs and they got together for the first time that day and helped each other
[47:34.400 --> 47:43.680]  put out the fire when the militiamen at the North Bridge they were a mile away
[47:43.680 --> 47:47.360]  from the North Bridge on a hill saw the smoke they were certain that the
[47:47.360 --> 47:53.720]  British were burning the town and they started to march back toward town when
[47:53.720 --> 47:59.000]  they saw all that smoke from the fires and they were asked in typical militia
[47:59.000 --> 48:03.440]  fashion who wants to go all of the commanders and troops were consulted
[48:03.440 --> 48:09.200]  and captain Isaac Davis said I have not a man that is afraid to go and they
[48:09.200 --> 48:13.880]  lined up and headed toward the bridge spread out along the hillside in a row
[48:13.880 --> 48:19.120]  of twos with strict orders not to fire until the British fired first but then
[48:19.120 --> 48:25.280]  fire as fast as you can when the British saw them coming they fell back from the
[48:25.280 --> 48:29.960]  bridge and they started pulling up the planks on the bridge one of the militia
[48:29.960 --> 48:35.120]  majors a major butchering was upset that was his family land and had been since
[48:35.120 --> 48:41.640]  1638 he consulted with his men took time out to have a meeting and they
[48:41.640 --> 48:46.320]  consented to attack and two regiments marched down the hill with drums and
[48:46.320 --> 48:52.960]  fights marching in formation militiamen marching in formation that's so shocked
[48:52.960 --> 48:58.360]  the British is untellable how how much of a shock that was to them they didn't
[48:58.360 --> 49:03.600]  believe that the militia would would come in there in good order their officers
[49:03.600 --> 49:08.120]  had been saying all along that the people of Massachusetts were nothing but an
[49:08.120 --> 49:13.840]  armed rabble major Pitcairn had said I only need to start to draw my sword out
[49:13.840 --> 49:21.200]  of the scabbard no run so tell folks what happened well the British were lined
[49:21.200 --> 49:27.400]  up for what they called a street volley and there were only eight or ten abreast
[49:27.400 --> 49:31.520]  and one row would fire and then the succeeding row would come up and they
[49:31.520 --> 49:35.480]  would keep up a continuous fire that way but they were bunched up with a narrow
[49:35.480 --> 49:44.160]  front when the militia came down the hill one of the British troops in a line
[49:44.160 --> 49:50.520]  nobody knows who fired and all the rest of the British began to fire Isaac Davis
[49:50.520 --> 49:55.520]  was killed in that opening volley with a ball through the heart when the British
[49:55.520 --> 49:59.240]  fired they were never taught to aim there were no sights on a brown best
[49:59.240 --> 50:05.120]  musket and usually they shot high it's just kind of the way they work this was
[50:05.120 --> 50:09.600]  designed for huge armies blasting each other from just fifty yards away right
[50:09.600 --> 50:14.200]  they fired in formation and and really they considered the bayonet to be the
[50:14.200 --> 50:21.000]  primary weapon so they would fire the gun and then fix bayonets if it weren't
[50:21.000 --> 50:30.160]  already and do a rush well we aimed the British didn't they shot high we shot
[50:30.160 --> 50:35.360]  low and we decimated the British almost exterminated every officer in that
[50:35.360 --> 50:39.960]  company all right stay there stay there I want to hear more about this to the
[50:39.960 --> 50:46.800]  listeners the start of the war that led to this republic and now we have the
[50:46.800 --> 50:50.520]  great great great grandchildren of the British new world order system bringing
[50:50.520 --> 50:55.560]  in their corporate slave state yet again and attempting to decimate the second

[54:58.040 --> 55:02.560]  having back on for a part to some of the incredible things that happened during
[55:02.560 --> 55:07.840]  the war you know I can tell these stories to but not as calmly and as Sam is
[55:07.840 --> 55:11.240]  doing I mean so much happened and what happened to Trenton after all these
[55:11.240 --> 55:15.920]  battles they'd lost I mean literally dragging cannons you know many miles
[55:15.920 --> 55:21.720]  through the snow from Ticonderoga I mean just all the I mean the dedication it
[55:21.720 --> 55:25.240]  was really amazing and the hardship and three to one five to one ten to one and
[55:25.240 --> 55:29.920]  some of the battles just absolutely amazing Sam let's accelerate now and
[55:29.920 --> 55:33.920]  and start getting into a little bit shorter of the version of what happened
[55:33.920 --> 55:39.360]  so so the British get blasted off the bridge most the officers get killed the
[55:39.360 --> 55:45.480]  war is on continue right at this point we're with the Apple seed folks called
[55:45.480 --> 55:50.520]  a second strike with the initial engagement at the North Bridge and the
[55:50.520 --> 55:54.400]  British regulars with all their officers shot the pieces turned and ran for
[55:54.400 --> 55:59.600]  their lives headed back for town and this is a really surprising thing that
[55:59.600 --> 56:04.480]  to many people remember I said earlier that a bunch of the British had gone to
[56:04.480 --> 56:10.080]  Barrett's farm to try to find guns as those British came back across the
[56:10.080 --> 56:16.680]  bridge they saw one of their wounded men who was laying on the far side of the
[56:16.680 --> 56:22.200]  bridge a bystander after the shooting had come up and hit him in the head with a
[56:22.200 --> 56:27.360]  hatchet nobody knows for sure who did that but they got the impression that
[56:27.360 --> 56:31.760]  this guy had been scalped and that word spread through the army and was one of
[56:31.760 --> 56:36.720]  the reasons why the British committed so many atrocities later in the day but the
[56:36.720 --> 56:41.880]  militia who were on either side of the bridge let that unit pass through unharmed
[56:41.880 --> 56:46.920]  they were still reluctant to initiate a fight with the King's troops and that
[56:46.920 --> 56:50.560]  unit coming back through from Barrett's farm didn't fire at them and they let them
[56:50.560 --> 56:55.960]  go at this point the militia is still in a highly defensive mode they're not
[56:55.960 --> 57:03.040]  taking open action against the British we're at noon on that day now on the
[57:03.040 --> 57:08.080]  19th of April and Colonel Francis Smith the head of the regulars is marching his
[57:08.080 --> 57:14.080]  troops out of Concord heading back to Boston and as he left he knows the
[57:14.080 --> 57:19.320]  hills are alive with militia who are coming from many parts of those alarm
[57:19.320 --> 57:26.160]  riders that went out along with with Paul Revere had alerted the militia all
[57:26.160 --> 57:31.400]  through Middlesex that area of Massachusetts and they were all heading
[57:31.400 --> 57:39.280]  for for Concord at that time several thousand of them and as they lined up
[57:39.280 --> 57:44.920]  around Concord Colonel Smith saw them and he was afraid he knew that he had
[57:44.920 --> 57:50.040]  serious problems going they were starting to come up with a formidable
[57:50.040 --> 57:56.520]  adversary something that they had to respect not just 50 60 70 200 militiamen
[57:56.520 --> 58:02.880]  but a couple of thousand militiamen and as they headed on back they got to a
[58:02.880 --> 58:08.440]  place called Merriam's Corner which was between Lexington and Concord a sharp
[58:08.440 --> 58:13.480]  bend in the road and it was at Merriam's Corner that the militia took their main
[58:13.480 --> 58:19.000]  action of the day the third try at lighting the match of revolution and at
[58:19.000 --> 58:24.120]  that point the British fired from the back of their formation into some of
[58:24.120 --> 58:29.200]  the militia troops stay there we got to come back seventy second break Sam

[1:01:26.200 --> 1:01:30.960]  through those first days all right Alex we're at a junction in country road
[1:01:30.960 --> 1:01:36.000]  called Mariams corner between Lexington and Concord militia have been pouring
[1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:41.080]  into the area all day not a simple battle plan where people were firing from
[1:01:41.080 --> 1:01:44.880]  behind rocks and trees like we've been led to believe this is the
[1:01:44.880 --> 1:01:53.120]  sophisticated plan put together by a self-educated self-appointed general by
[1:01:53.120 --> 1:01:58.520]  the name of William Heath a book dealer from Massachusetts who sat and read
[1:01:58.520 --> 1:02:03.040]  every military text that he could find and he was the appointed military
[1:02:03.040 --> 1:02:10.560]  leader for the colony of Massachusetts they began a series of ambushes against
[1:02:10.560 --> 1:02:16.600]  the British and these were well thought out and planned it was what he called a
[1:02:16.600 --> 1:02:21.960]  circle of fire as the British moved down the road new elements of militia would
[1:02:21.960 --> 1:02:26.320]  move down the road ahead of them and set up and as the British passed they'd
[1:02:26.320 --> 1:02:31.320]  shoot them to pieces sometimes from behind rocks and trees usually in good
[1:02:31.320 --> 1:02:35.560]  order from well back off the road the British had to put out a lot of their
[1:02:35.560 --> 1:02:39.680]  troops as flankers keep these groups from getting together they won the small
[1:02:39.680 --> 1:02:44.240]  groups of British flankers went out to do that they didn't have as much fire
[1:02:44.240 --> 1:02:49.400]  power and they became prime targets so the militia kept up a running fire
[1:02:49.400 --> 1:02:55.960]  against the British all along General Gage must have had some idea that these
[1:02:55.960 --> 1:03:00.560]  people were going to be in trouble because he sent out a force under a
[1:03:00.560 --> 1:03:07.040]  fella named Lord Percy to reinforce them and supplement their numbers I guess he
[1:03:07.040 --> 1:03:11.520]  knew they were going to run into trouble the Lord Percy was a typical
[1:03:11.520 --> 1:03:21.360]  British gentleman a member of the carriage thought well of himself and the
[1:03:21.360 --> 1:03:24.920]  only main thing that he really had to say when he wrote back after it I had the
[1:03:24.920 --> 1:03:29.520]  pleasure of keeping them from being exterminated because the militia fire
[1:03:29.520 --> 1:03:33.720]  was so heavy on the British regulars when he came up they were about to lose
[1:03:33.720 --> 1:03:38.600]  it completely and they were fired upon the entire way back and this is where
[1:03:38.600 --> 1:03:45.960]  those those people those common people went out and did their stuff most of the
[1:03:45.960 --> 1:03:49.160]  old men were in what were called the alarm bands because it was thought that
[1:03:49.160 --> 1:03:53.680]  they were too old to fight so you go out and you give the alarm you collect the
[1:03:53.680 --> 1:03:58.240]  intel you let us know when the regulars are coming a lot of these guys didn't do
[1:03:58.240 --> 1:04:05.880]  that so they had men like Hezekiah Wyman it was his birthday April 19th was his
[1:04:05.880 --> 1:04:10.360]  birthday I believe he was 55 years old and his wife said you're too old to
[1:04:10.360 --> 1:04:18.080]  fight he got on his good white mare took his musket and went out and as a one
[1:04:18.080 --> 1:04:24.560]  man force took on the British he'd pop up ahead of him get off rest his musket
[1:04:24.560 --> 1:04:28.920]  across the horse take a shot at him get on the horse and ride away down the road
[1:04:28.920 --> 1:04:34.560]  and do it again the grim gray haired messenger of mortality mounted on death
[1:04:34.560 --> 1:04:41.720]  pale horse you don't run into people like that anymore we're gonna tell more
[1:04:41.720 --> 1:04:45.000]  of these stories when we get back on the other side continuing without this
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:51.600]  unfolded and 75 year old men 80 year old men involved in the fight how many
[1:04:51.600 --> 1:04:56.920]  British got killed that day what it led to and then getting into the modern

[1:05:03.120 --> 1:05:06.680]  been afraid they needed their food supplies before the election the

[1:05:24.280 --> 1:05:29.320]  unpopular decisions this functions as an important deadline for getting any
[1:05:29.320 --> 1:05:33.920]  food you intend to have the unpopular presidential decisions will likely
[1:05:33.920 --> 1:05:39.400]  affect restriction of transportation and availability of food distribution order

[1:09:23.360 --> 1:09:27.840]  and and through the ballot box but make the mistake the enemy is going to push
[1:09:27.840 --> 1:09:30.440]  it into physical conflict it's very important for the American people to
[1:09:30.440 --> 1:09:34.600]  understand our heritage and understand our history so they can know it needs to
[1:09:34.600 --> 1:09:38.280]  be done in the future and so that's what we're doing here on this radio show is
[1:09:38.280 --> 1:09:42.160]  educating you with a committee of correspondence about the crimes about the
[1:09:42.160 --> 1:09:47.640]  abuses that are taking place in this country and worldwide today Sam I want
[1:09:47.640 --> 1:09:52.040]  to take calls coming up the next two segments at 800 to 5 at 9 9 2 3 1
[1:09:52.040 --> 1:09:55.800]  specifically on history and the riflemen and the attack on the Second
[1:09:55.800 --> 1:10:00.240]  Amendment culture but before we do that let's continue with what happened that
[1:10:00.240 --> 1:10:03.840]  day and tell us about some of the other characters involved and then what this
[1:10:03.840 --> 1:10:11.440]  led to okay Alex but has a kaya wyman the guy who was too old is one of the
[1:10:11.440 --> 1:10:18.800]  characters in what we call the dangerous old men and the entire game that day it
[1:10:18.800 --> 1:10:22.960]  was full of dangerous old men one of them was Samuel Whittemore that you
[1:10:22.960 --> 1:10:28.800]  mentioned earlier the man was 79 years old the veteran of the French and Indian
[1:10:28.800 --> 1:10:34.480]  Wars armed himself with a musket a saber and two pistols and opened fire on
[1:10:34.480 --> 1:10:39.720]  the British when they came by they sent a detachment to clear him out he had
[1:10:39.720 --> 1:10:45.240]  killed at least three British before they got up to him he was shot in the
[1:10:45.240 --> 1:10:50.080]  side and had inside of his head and had half of his face blown away and he was
[1:10:50.080 --> 1:10:57.040]  bayoneted they found him later that day with 14 wounds in his body from bayonets
[1:10:57.040 --> 1:11:03.000]  and gunfire he lived to be 96 years old and if you look at the phone books in
[1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:07.960]  middle sex I think he tried to repopulate the entire state of Massachusetts on his
[1:11:07.960 --> 1:11:15.000]  own there are a lot of Whittemores up there the British commander sent an
[1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:19.200]  ammunition wagon back to resupply them because they only carried 36 rounds in
[1:11:19.200 --> 1:11:24.080]  our cartridge boxes and the cannon that Lord Percy had with him only had 12
[1:11:24.080 --> 1:11:28.520]  rounds with them what they carried in the side boxes the ammunition wagon was
[1:11:28.520 --> 1:11:33.560]  guarded by a crew of Brennan granted years the biggest meanest ugliest looking
[1:11:33.560 --> 1:11:38.760]  assault troops in the British Army that's the Marines the Marines they were
[1:11:38.760 --> 1:11:45.320]  assaulted by the old men of Wolburn led by a fellow named Daniel Lampson the
[1:11:45.320 --> 1:11:50.200]  only record of him is known that he was a mulatto and he led his group of
[1:11:50.200 --> 1:11:56.280]  elderly neighbors to capture that supply wagon disabled the horses shot the
[1:11:56.280 --> 1:12:01.200]  officers and ran off the troops and they got the ammunition wagon so there was no
[1:12:01.200 --> 1:12:07.240]  resupply those grenadiers ran off in fear scared for their lives through
[1:12:07.240 --> 1:12:12.920]  their guns into a pond and when looking for a place to hide they came across an
[1:12:12.920 --> 1:12:18.760]  old woman named Mother Bathrick this woman is so poor she's not digging
[1:12:18.760 --> 1:12:24.440]  dandelions in a field to get some greens to eat they surrendered to her and she
[1:12:24.440 --> 1:12:29.840]  took him and turned him over to the militia this was a very bad PR coup
[1:12:29.840 --> 1:12:35.040]  for for the British because their critics and Parliament popped up and
[1:12:35.040 --> 1:12:39.400]  said if one old Yankee woman could take six grenadiers how many soldiers will
[1:12:39.400 --> 1:12:46.320]  it take to conquer America we scared the British badly that day we decimated
[1:12:46.320 --> 1:12:51.480]  them they lost twice as many people as we did and we kept up a running fire on
[1:12:51.480 --> 1:12:56.640]  them all the way back to Charlestown which is a suburb of Boston they hold
[1:12:56.640 --> 1:13:01.080]  up on the other side and after that began the siege of Boston which is where
[1:13:01.080 --> 1:13:07.520]  the war proper got going I think it's very important in this entire story to
[1:13:07.520 --> 1:13:13.800]  remember that the militia fought a purely defensive action they didn't take
[1:13:13.800 --> 1:13:17.840]  aggressive act we had old man Jason Russell who was too crippled to walk
[1:13:17.840 --> 1:13:22.760]  said an Englishman's home is his castle sent the wife and kids away and
[1:13:22.760 --> 1:13:27.960]  stayed home and when the regulars came up he fought them they killed him dead
[1:13:27.960 --> 1:13:32.600]  him and 11 others there at the house whether it was good judgment to fort
[1:13:32.600 --> 1:13:36.960]  up in the house and let him surround them and take him I won't go into that
[1:13:36.960 --> 1:13:42.520]  but the man was out there too crippled to walk and he's gonna gonna defend his
[1:13:42.520 --> 1:13:46.440]  home from the British Army and this is the kind of character that these people
[1:13:46.440 --> 1:13:50.080]  had and now look at us today the police in Illinois just do home inspections
[1:13:50.080 --> 1:13:56.000]  without warrants I mean all of this humiliation the entire Magna Carta
[1:13:56.000 --> 1:13:59.120]  completely erased we don't even have the Magna Carta forget the bill of rights
[1:13:59.120 --> 1:14:05.320]  in this country that is an issue and it's something that the people are going
[1:14:05.320 --> 1:14:11.200]  to have to sit down and decide for themselves where all of this goes and
[1:14:11.200 --> 1:14:16.200]  well as for me I am going to try to rally as many people as I can to this
[1:14:16.200 --> 1:14:20.320]  threat and I'm not going to any FEMA camp I might turn my guns in and that's
[1:14:20.320 --> 1:14:24.560]  just the end of it I am defensive though and and and not just historically or
[1:14:24.560 --> 1:14:28.800]  from a Christian perspective from a propaganda perspective the fact that
[1:14:28.800 --> 1:14:31.960]  they are gonna squeeze they are gonna gun confiscate it's already happening all
[1:14:31.960 --> 1:14:36.360]  over the place the harassment the fact is more and more people will defensively
[1:14:36.360 --> 1:14:42.560]  fight the the the regulars are going to have to stand down and if the people will
[1:14:42.560 --> 1:14:45.640]  just stand up and not be slaves they're not gonna be able to get away with this
[1:14:45.640 --> 1:14:49.960]  you know Obama's saying don't worry he's in the newspaper today he's in the
[1:14:49.960 --> 1:14:54.360]  Sun Times Obama don't stock up on guns he says well I'm gonna reasonably restrict
[1:14:54.360 --> 1:14:59.160]  your guns that means ban many types and it goes through his votes to ban it 308
[1:14:59.160 --> 1:15:05.840]  223 assault weapons how is gonna create larger gun confiscation crews I mean
[1:15:05.840 --> 1:15:09.640]  it's all right here and I've got news for the government I'm glad that the
[1:15:09.640 --> 1:15:13.960]  American people are buying the gun stores clean and the ammo clean off the
[1:15:13.960 --> 1:15:20.280]  shelves at many times previous records this is the all-time record Sam it is
[1:15:20.280 --> 1:15:25.920]  it is I'm a gunsmith by trade at this point in my life and and I'll tell you
[1:15:25.920 --> 1:15:31.600]  that I've been cleaned out my shop is empty one thing that people need to
[1:15:31.600 --> 1:15:36.560]  remember is that just owning all these weapons is not going to help them they
[1:15:36.560 --> 1:15:39.840]  need to know what they're doing and they need to become disciplined a rifleman
[1:15:39.840 --> 1:15:44.560]  and this is where Apple seed comes in they need to come out and learn how to
[1:15:44.560 --> 1:15:52.200]  use those weapons and we don't make any any pay about how they should use them
[1:15:52.200 --> 1:15:56.680]  when where why that's what I love you are politically neutral and some say
[1:15:56.680 --> 1:15:59.840]  you've got to throw in and say it's a military group let's go off and have a
[1:15:59.840 --> 1:16:05.000]  war no no or a training arm to teach our heritage teach our history and to be
[1:16:05.000 --> 1:16:09.920]  mainline to get people trained in the skill of being a rifleman hitting a
[1:16:09.920 --> 1:16:14.400]  target a man-sized target at 500 yards which basically anybody can do if you
[1:16:14.400 --> 1:16:19.840]  just go out and take the training tell us all about it okay Alex the Apple
[1:16:19.840 --> 1:16:26.000]  seed program conducts shoots all over the nation today training clinics we'll
[1:16:26.000 --> 1:16:32.320]  take a group of people and teach them to use rifles effectively we teach them to
[1:16:32.320 --> 1:16:36.760]  the old standard that we used to use for the United States Army it's readily
[1:16:36.760 --> 1:16:42.720]  achievable by anyone is with even moderate fitness and health yeah there's
[1:16:42.720 --> 1:16:46.600]  no magic to this it just takes a lot of practice it's very exciting me great
[1:16:46.600 --> 1:16:50.400]  people tell folks all about it oh they're fantastic people because they
[1:16:50.400 --> 1:16:55.360]  come out and they want to learn they come with an open mind and we teach them
[1:16:55.360 --> 1:17:02.840]  through six steps how to fire a rifle accurately and effectively we generally
[1:17:02.840 --> 1:17:07.800]  do the training at 25 yards so the people can practice with a with a 22 if
[1:17:07.800 --> 1:17:12.960]  they want and all these skills will pass on to larger rifles at longer ranges
[1:17:12.960 --> 1:17:19.080]  later on but through this two-day course we go through we make an initial
[1:17:19.080 --> 1:17:23.240]  assessment of their ability shooting on a target which they save and at the end
[1:17:23.240 --> 1:17:27.400]  of that two days they fire the same target in course of fire and they can
[1:17:27.400 --> 1:17:30.760]  compare those two targets and see what the difference is and how much skill
[1:17:30.760 --> 1:17:38.160]  they've gained most people that that that come think they're pretty good shots
[1:17:38.160 --> 1:17:42.240]  already there's a lot of testosterone floating around out in America and of
[1:17:42.240 --> 1:17:47.360]  course every American's a good shot well they are from a bench with a scope
[1:17:47.360 --> 1:17:51.800]  sighted hunting rifle but that doesn't do anybody much good that's not an
[1:17:51.800 --> 1:17:57.960]  effective application of the rifle so we teach people to take a common ordinary
[1:17:57.960 --> 1:18:04.840]  rifle and common ordinary ammunition and be able to effectively control 500
[1:18:04.840 --> 1:18:10.760]  yards in front of them the rifleman's quarter mile they call it it's a bit
[1:18:10.760 --> 1:18:18.280]  more than a quarter mile but that's what it does 500 yards the rifleman can hit
[1:18:18.280 --> 1:18:22.760]  any target he can see inside that distance and that's a reasonable goal
[1:18:22.760 --> 1:18:30.200]  for anyone with a rifle now we feel that if we have enough people in America who
[1:18:30.200 --> 1:18:35.680]  know how to use a rifle use it effectively that we will win the war
[1:18:35.680 --> 1:18:42.160]  without ever having to touch a rifle I'm going to refer to an article that was
[1:18:42.160 --> 1:18:48.080]  written by a gentleman named of Jeff Knox in the shotgun news last week he
[1:18:48.080 --> 1:18:56.800]  referred to the militia as mutual assured destruction if we ever have to get
[1:18:56.800 --> 1:19:01.480]  into an engagement it will be mutual assured destruction and that is not the
[1:19:01.480 --> 1:19:07.280]  goal our goal is to be strong enough that the government and anybody else in
[1:19:07.280 --> 1:19:11.680]  the world will realize that you are not going to play with the American people
[1:19:11.680 --> 1:19:17.560]  period and if we have enough people who are trained effectively enough no one
[1:19:17.560 --> 1:19:20.840]  will ever fire a shot and that is our goal that's why they're trying to
[1:19:20.840 --> 1:19:24.680]  demonize the culture brainwash the children and go after that way we must
[1:19:24.680 --> 1:19:30.120]  explode as emissaries happily with the Second Amendment getting everybody
[1:19:30.120 --> 1:19:34.400]  involved in its history and then getting them involved in how to use a handgun a
[1:19:34.400 --> 1:19:39.120]  rifle a shotgun but the key as you said is the rifle and the rifleman that is
[1:19:39.120 --> 1:19:43.560]  that is mad that is mutually assured destruction and the enemy won't be able
[1:19:43.560 --> 1:19:47.600]  to move on it but Sam I think in a way you're wrong though they are going to
[1:19:47.600 --> 1:19:52.720]  move even if it is mad they are mad and they are moving with the National
[1:19:52.720 --> 1:20:01.160]  Guard in Illinois doing door-to-door gun confiscations under controlled areas hi
[1:20:01.160 --> 1:20:05.000]  this is Ted Anderson have you ever wondered why banks stockbrokers

[1:24:40.440 --> 1:24:44.480]  have time to go shooting four or five times a year I'm just horrible you lose
[1:24:44.480 --> 1:24:48.600]  the skill very quickly and yeah I've been out with some people that claim to
[1:24:48.600 --> 1:24:52.000]  these great shots they can't hit the side of a barn we need good people to get
[1:24:52.000 --> 1:24:56.240]  involved in something mainline something that's that everybody can be part of
[1:24:56.240 --> 1:25:01.880]  something that is very patriotic to then massively grow our numbers and the gun
[1:25:01.880 --> 1:25:07.040]  culture has been on the front lines defeating the establishment but they're
[1:25:07.040 --> 1:25:10.760]  covertly coming in against it but people are really waking up now to this
[1:25:10.760 --> 1:25:14.520]  most precious of rights the right to self-defense so check out the fine

[1:26:03.880 --> 1:26:08.720]  best way to get involved is go to apple seed info dot org last year we held
[1:26:08.720 --> 1:26:15.200]  events and I believe 39 states we want to be in every state this year if you
[1:26:15.200 --> 1:26:20.920]  have people and have access to a range we will come put on an apple seed clinic
[1:26:20.920 --> 1:26:27.840]  in your town that's how we operate we do charge for it we charge just enough to
[1:26:27.840 --> 1:26:31.080]  cover the cost of transporting instructor staff and equipment to your
[1:26:31.080 --> 1:26:38.240]  location if you have a range we can put on one if you have a piece of farmland
[1:26:38.240 --> 1:26:43.320]  with a hill behind it we can put on an apple seed at your place we will come to
[1:26:43.320 --> 1:26:48.920]  you if you can't come to us if you go to apple seed info you'll find out how to
[1:26:48.920 --> 1:26:53.640]  sign up for one of our shoots and how to contact us to put one on in your area
[1:26:53.640 --> 1:26:59.960]  we will do that we'll go any place where it's legal to fire a firearm with any
[1:26:59.960 --> 1:27:04.040]  group of people who are legal to own them and we will teach you to use them how
[1:27:04.040 --> 1:27:08.840]  many how many have you put on how many states how many events how many people
[1:27:08.840 --> 1:27:15.160]  well we've been going for three years now the goal is to double every year this
[1:27:15.160 --> 1:27:21.440]  year so far we've hit about 4,000 people and I believe we had 180 events this
[1:27:21.440 --> 1:27:25.920]  year and that's exponential that's exponential because it's mainline
[1:27:25.920 --> 1:27:28.640]  shooting but it also teaches you about the founding fathers
[1:27:28.640 --> 1:27:32.840]  Bella rights Constitution our history why the rifleman so important and if
[1:27:32.840 --> 1:27:36.480]  you're exponentially growing in three years 4,000 people it could be 8,000
[1:27:36.480 --> 1:27:42.080]  then 16,000 then you know 30 plus thousand this is so exciting it is
[1:27:42.080 --> 1:27:48.200]  Alex and we'd we our goal is to double every year but I'll be a lot happier if
[1:27:48.200 --> 1:27:53.880]  we travel every year yeah we may not have that long and again I like the

[1:32:08.040 --> 1:32:12.480]  exposure is impossible to avoid heavy metals build up within the body over a
[1:32:12.480 --> 1:32:16.320]  period of time causing poor health however with Keelarex they can be
[1:32:16.320 --> 1:32:20.280]  mobilized and excreted in a safe and effective manner Keelarex was developed
[1:32:20.280 --> 1:32:23.880]  based on Dr. Alan Greenberg's clinical experience with heavy metal poisoning
[1:32:23.880 --> 1:32:29.080]  during his 25 years of medical practice Keelarex does not contain EDTA and is
[1:32:29.080 --> 1:32:33.000]  made from all natural ingredients enhancing the body's natural mechanisms
[1:32:33.000 --> 1:32:36.560]  for excreting heavy metals and preventing their reabsorption Keelarex
[1:32:36.560 --> 1:32:40.440]  contains antioxidants to protect the liver kidneys central nervous system and
[1:32:40.440 --> 1:32:44.480]  immune functions and effectively mobilizes mercury and 15 other heavy
[1:32:44.480 --> 1:32:48.720]  metals including aluminum arsenic lead and more find out what Keelarex can do

[1:33:00.520 --> 1:33:20.560]  I wish your buck was still silver it was back when the country was wrong
[1:33:20.560 --> 1:33:37.680]  back before else before the Vietnam War came along before the Beatles and
[1:33:37.680 --> 1:33:52.760]  yesterday when a man could still work still would the best of the free life
[1:33:52.760 --> 1:34:03.680]  behind us now we're back live with our guest one of the main coordinators
[1:34:03.680 --> 1:34:15.320]  instructors the Apple Seed Project the RWVA Revolutionary War Veterans
[1:34:15.320 --> 1:34:23.200]  Association what it's all about find out more I want to go to some calls now
[1:34:23.200 --> 1:34:27.240]  Joe and Maine David Virginia and others Joe and Maine you're on the air with our
[1:34:27.240 --> 1:34:42.120]  guest welcome I was speaking with a couple of people about the Second
[1:34:42.120 --> 1:34:47.120]  Amendment and basically what I tried to say to them you know is that there really
[1:34:47.120 --> 1:34:51.920]  is no gray area in the Second Amendment it's the right for the people to keep
[1:34:51.920 --> 1:34:58.000]  them their arms so not being friends and they just didn't get it and all they
[1:34:58.000 --> 1:35:03.360]  could say was well you can't carry concealed I said why can't you where's
[1:35:03.360 --> 1:35:09.200]  the gray area that says you can't well those are domesticated people and you
[1:35:09.200 --> 1:35:13.400]  just have to move on from them and wake up those that can be woken up but but
[1:35:13.400 --> 1:35:17.240]  the main thing is there's a hundred and sixty million gun owners in the United
[1:35:17.240 --> 1:35:21.000]  States probably more and we need to get them mobilized to just wake up one
[1:35:21.000 --> 1:35:24.880]  person and we've got the whole country away only 300 million but but I mean
[1:35:24.880 --> 1:35:28.040]  even if they you know even if five million of the hundred and sixty million
[1:35:28.040 --> 1:35:31.520]  gun owners go out and wake somebody up we can take it back we can get politically
[1:35:31.520 --> 1:35:35.520]  active we need the good people that aren't idiots to get involved and to
[1:35:35.520 --> 1:35:39.360]  get properly trained and route and to and to stay in the gun culture and to
[1:35:39.360 --> 1:35:43.240]  grow it and we need to go out just like you know Christians go out and take
[1:35:43.240 --> 1:35:46.720]  people over to the side of Jesus and get them saved we got to get people born
[1:35:46.720 --> 1:35:49.600]  again into the Second Amendment and liberty and freedom and what this
[1:35:49.600 --> 1:35:53.840]  country is all about Sam Damwood you want to comment on that you hit it
[1:35:53.840 --> 1:35:58.840]  exactly right Alex we have to get the people behind it we have to get the
[1:35:58.840 --> 1:36:04.760]  word out we have to teach people we have to become a nation of riflemen again
[1:36:04.760 --> 1:36:09.400]  and look at Sam in three years with his group they have reached out and woken up
[1:36:09.400 --> 1:36:14.160]  with a handful of volunteers 4,000 people trained discovering what this
[1:36:14.160 --> 1:36:18.280]  country is being able to hit a man-sized target at 500 yards what if all of you
[1:36:18.280 --> 1:36:21.520]  did similar things or used organizations like this to help expand
[1:36:21.520 --> 1:36:26.440]  things the solution is in the mirror so those domesticated people in that bar
[1:36:26.440 --> 1:36:30.760]  maybe give them a book materials I've got videos from Jews preservation of
[1:36:30.760 --> 1:36:35.640]  firearms ownership about the history of gun control you know maybe you know get
[1:36:35.640 --> 1:36:39.360]  that and give it to them but every person you unlock every person you
[1:36:39.360 --> 1:36:43.240]  literally take from being a gelded neutered slave to being a free human
[1:36:43.240 --> 1:36:48.560]  and and and freedom is a mental place it's a spiritual place and and and it's
[1:36:48.560 --> 1:36:53.080]  I mean look the guns are all sold out people are waking up just in your area
[1:36:53.080 --> 1:36:56.080]  of Maine you've got some comfortable domesticated people I don't mean
[1:36:56.080 --> 1:37:00.000]  actually people in Maine are very on average individualistic and hard-working
[1:37:00.000 --> 1:37:03.600]  from what I've seen what I know but I guess that particular pocket are some
[1:37:03.600 --> 1:37:10.040]  gelded slaves so just move on thank you Alex yes I totally agree with what you
[1:37:10.040 --> 1:37:14.680]  saying and even though there are a bunch of people up here in Maine that are not
[1:37:14.680 --> 1:37:20.360]  so deluded I guess is the way to say it yeah just I would really like because
[1:37:20.360 --> 1:37:24.680]  it's it's it's uncomfortable especially not knowing who to talk to and who not
[1:37:24.680 --> 1:37:29.240]  to talk to who to confide in well try this don't be uncomfortable about it
[1:37:29.240 --> 1:37:32.440]  say man you know what we got a second amendment it's to be a free country you
[1:37:32.440 --> 1:37:35.840]  know cities that have no gun control have the lowest crime rates those that do
[1:37:35.840 --> 1:37:39.240]  have gun control have higher crime rates you know really talk to them listen I
[1:37:39.240 --> 1:37:42.840]  appreciate your call let's talk to David in Virginia you're on the air with our
[1:37:42.840 --> 1:37:47.880]  guests go ahead David how you doing Alex good all right my question is I had
[1:37:47.880 --> 1:37:53.400]  actually downloaded the form from my state to get a registered handgun and I
[1:37:53.400 --> 1:37:57.720]  heard rumors in the past that if you were arrested for a misdemeanor or maybe a
[1:37:57.720 --> 1:38:02.200]  DUI or something that they can actually prevent you from getting a gun is that
[1:38:02.200 --> 1:38:06.200]  true can't you have to force them to not violate the first amendment it's only
[1:38:06.200 --> 1:38:10.120]  felonies you have to go to a judge usually cost a few hundred bucks and
[1:38:10.120 --> 1:38:13.960]  and and and they're expanding the nicks they're expanding all this to restrict
[1:38:13.960 --> 1:38:17.560]  they're adding veterans on the list for no reason they're putting psychological
[1:38:17.560 --> 1:38:20.920]  files on it they're claiming a name is spelled wrong on your Medicare or
[1:38:20.920 --> 1:38:25.160]  Medicaid or Social Security so you can't we have to say no to the bureaucracy
[1:38:25.160 --> 1:38:28.920]  when they do this all right and one more thing I would just like to say to all
[1:38:28.920 --> 1:38:33.880]  the listeners you know don't just take in the information make sure you go out
[1:38:33.880 --> 1:38:37.880]  and do the research and and back up like what people like you Alex are saying
[1:38:37.880 --> 1:38:42.200]  because that will help them you know know that it is true I hear you David David
[1:38:42.200 --> 1:38:44.440]  I hear you get your ready on the background I appreciate your call folks
[1:38:44.440 --> 1:38:50.280]  try to turn those off look last time I checked you don't need a license see
[1:38:50.280 --> 1:38:54.760]  Hollywood and movies show cops arresting people for an unlicensed gun
[1:38:54.760 --> 1:38:59.320]  that's only a few cities okay so they and everybody thinks you need a license
[1:38:59.320 --> 1:39:03.000]  they think you need a license to own the guns in Texas I've had a carpet cleaner
[1:39:03.000 --> 1:39:06.440]  almost called the cops on me for a shotgun on the wall a decade ago you've
[1:39:06.440 --> 1:39:10.920]  heard the story they're dumb we have to get out and expose to them
[1:39:10.920 --> 1:39:14.680]  that that they're trying to make guns illegal by fiat just to create the
[1:39:14.680 --> 1:39:18.520]  illusion that that's the case we have to reverse that and we have to go out and
[1:39:18.520 --> 1:39:23.240]  educate people Sam that's true Alex and Apple seed is the
[1:39:23.240 --> 1:39:27.320]  answer we will educate the people we make riflemen
[1:39:27.320 --> 1:39:31.080]  well armed Americans who are trained in the tradition of American Liberty
[1:39:31.080 --> 1:39:34.920]  well Sam you've got my number and I want to try to help you coming on the show I
[1:39:34.920 --> 1:39:37.880]  have millions of listeners they're also not just millions they're the most active
[1:39:37.880 --> 1:39:40.680]  listeners out there period everybody says that he's been on has been
[1:39:40.680 --> 1:39:45.160]  guessed people go on you know meet the press or they go on rush limbaugh and
[1:39:45.160 --> 1:39:48.280]  they get less response than they get here those audiences are much bigger but
[1:39:48.280 --> 1:39:51.480]  they're not active we're going to make sure you get on on
[1:39:51.480 --> 1:39:57.000]  April 19th next year in all 50 states a event we've got to make sure that happens
[1:39:57.000 --> 1:40:02.520]  we've got to grow grow grow we'll 4001 year and starting three years ago
[1:40:02.520 --> 1:40:05.880]  and you know let's I mean let's have let's reach 50 000
[1:40:05.880 --> 1:40:10.120]  next year Rick and Reno you're on the air
[1:40:10.120 --> 1:40:15.480]  I have a comment and then a question my comment is that at a uh recently at a
[1:40:15.480 --> 1:40:19.800]  gun range uh some fellow let his kids shoot a mac 10 and the kid shot his
[1:40:19.800 --> 1:40:22.440]  space off do you bet the people who come to your
[1:40:22.440 --> 1:40:27.400]  ranges to uh sort out the incompetence from the competition
[1:40:27.400 --> 1:40:33.800]  that's a very good question we have very highly trained instructors
[1:40:33.800 --> 1:40:37.640]  and to be quite truthful we never would have had anyone like that
[1:40:37.640 --> 1:40:41.880]  out on our range firing a weapon like that number one
[1:40:41.880 --> 1:40:46.280]  we only do rifle but from what I understand the person who is actually
[1:40:46.280 --> 1:40:51.560]  supervising yet youngster was 15 or 16 years old
[1:40:51.560 --> 1:40:55.720]  and of no experience look let me say something there's gonna be
[1:40:55.720 --> 1:40:59.320]  you got 300 000 people a year dying in car accidents you got a few thousand
[1:40:59.320 --> 1:41:02.840]  with guns the point is you're gonna have idiots you're gonna have morons not
[1:41:02.840 --> 1:41:06.440]  these apple seeds events and if you see somebody handling a gun
[1:41:06.440 --> 1:41:09.880]  wrong at a gun range you know go call over the owner go call
[1:41:09.880 --> 1:41:13.160]  over the manager making it there are a lot of idiots out there just now
[1:41:13.160 --> 1:41:15.720]  getting into the second amendment they weren't brought up four years old in
[1:41:15.720 --> 1:41:19.320]  their grand eddie's lap with a 410 shotgun like everybody else was
[1:41:19.320 --> 1:41:22.920]  trained in this country in the gun culture and then taught safety
[1:41:22.920 --> 1:41:26.920]  you know a neurotically having an oil drummed into us and i see these people
[1:41:26.920 --> 1:41:29.960]  who who who aren't trained i see police who aren't properly trained
[1:41:29.960 --> 1:41:33.240]  that's why it's a shame that we had a true second amendment gun culture
[1:41:33.240 --> 1:41:36.440]  where everybody was basically taught when they were tiny knee height of a
[1:41:36.440 --> 1:41:40.600]  grasshopper and so there were never accidents like we have now
[1:41:40.600 --> 1:41:43.320]  people bought their handguns and rifles to school
[1:41:43.320 --> 1:41:47.240]  to go shooting after school even in big cities they have almost destroyed our
[1:41:47.240 --> 1:41:49.960]  gun culture we're going to get it back right sam
[1:41:49.960 --> 1:41:54.680]  that's right and if you come to apple seed you can help us do it
[1:41:54.680 --> 1:41:58.280]  we can save america by making educated american
[1:41:58.280 --> 1:42:02.920]  does that answer your question all right my question is this if i may
[1:42:02.920 --> 1:42:06.840]  first of all alex i it's an honor to to talk with you and thank you
[1:42:06.840 --> 1:42:14.120]  and mr damewood uh is it your uh plan or aim to
[1:42:14.120 --> 1:42:17.640]  invite mr obama and his family to your shooting range
[1:42:17.640 --> 1:42:22.760]  i think it's a good idea we would love to uh matter of fact i will go ahead and
[1:42:22.760 --> 1:42:26.440]  personally send an invitation myself this afternoon
[1:42:26.440 --> 1:42:30.840]  i urge alex and your audience to do the same because i'm going to do the same
[1:42:30.840 --> 1:42:35.240]  all right thank you uh let's talk to uh is the next one blake in texas and
[1:42:35.240 --> 1:42:39.720]  we're going to betty martini last caller blake in texas go ahead you're on the
[1:42:39.720 --> 1:42:45.160]  air hi there alex uh blake along with you uh actually i wanted to ask uh
[1:42:45.160 --> 1:42:50.760]  mr uh damewood there what uh what specific type of training do you get
[1:42:50.760 --> 1:42:53.800]  from coming to the apple seed i know you talked about the the rifle
[1:42:53.800 --> 1:42:58.760]  farm i'm an avid shooter myself uh with pistol and with rifle and uh what
[1:42:58.760 --> 1:43:02.680]  all what all do you do if you come up to an apple seed event what all do you go
[1:43:02.680 --> 1:43:06.680]  through again exactly okay to begin with will you
[1:43:06.680 --> 1:43:10.360]  evaluate your ability by having a fire on a target
[1:43:10.360 --> 1:43:14.440]  and then we'll teach you the six steps to firing an accurate shot
[1:43:14.440 --> 1:43:17.800]  over the course of two days you're going to fire more than 500 rounds of
[1:43:17.800 --> 1:43:21.320]  practice with intense close coaching and instruction the
[1:43:21.320 --> 1:43:25.800]  entire time and we will probably double your ability
[1:43:25.800 --> 1:43:29.560]  to hit if you put a patient effort into it after
[1:43:29.560 --> 1:43:34.360]  an apple seed you'll easily be able to hit targets out to 300 yards
[1:43:34.360 --> 1:43:37.880]  and if you're really good at it you practice a little bit afterward
[1:43:37.880 --> 1:43:42.360]  we'll have you where you can hit a target effectively reliably the 500 yards
[1:43:42.360 --> 1:43:45.320]  on demand yeah with basic frontier training that
[1:43:45.320 --> 1:43:48.600]  i know all the basic rural texan scott and i was kind of the last generation
[1:43:48.600 --> 1:43:51.480]  of that i need to get my children involved my son's been out shooting with
[1:43:51.480 --> 1:43:54.040]  his son just getting the basic training and he's six
[1:43:54.040 --> 1:43:57.800]  by the time i was 10 i could hit bull's eye you know sitting
[1:43:57.800 --> 1:44:02.120]  uh at a target range at about 300 yards you'll get on
[1:44:02.120 --> 1:44:05.160]  by the time i was about 14 when i got to be the best shot
[1:44:05.160 --> 1:44:09.240]  i could hold up a 243 and shoot the top off of the tabasco bottle
[1:44:09.240 --> 1:44:14.600]  at 200 yards uh you know now that that was probably with a three-power scope
[1:44:14.600 --> 1:44:18.280]  now i'd be lucky if i could hit the tabasco bottle uh but the point is
[1:44:18.280 --> 1:44:22.040]  if i could shoot the top off every time you blow the top off uh it obviously
[1:44:22.040 --> 1:44:24.840]  you're probably a great shooter the reason i'm saying my listeners need to
[1:44:24.840 --> 1:44:27.960]  get involved in apple seed they'll take the basic course show them you're a
[1:44:27.960 --> 1:44:31.480]  great shot know all the safety skills then become an instructor
[1:44:31.480 --> 1:44:35.480]  what we need is the cadres for force multiplication now
[1:44:35.480 --> 1:44:38.920]  on this front on the micro fm and am front we're about to roll out a plan
[1:44:38.920 --> 1:44:42.600]  with that uh to aggressively get the word out we have the info war and then
[1:44:42.600 --> 1:44:45.240]  the physical preparation for defense of the republic
[1:44:45.240 --> 1:44:49.560]  anything else blake actually one more final comment or a question for you mr
[1:44:49.560 --> 1:44:53.320]  alex uh i'm i'm actually it's very i'm only 24 years
[1:44:53.320 --> 1:44:56.520]  old here in lovely texas i'm not a very high position but i've been
[1:44:56.520 --> 1:45:00.360]  listening to you for for a while now and and i tell you what you're
[1:45:00.360 --> 1:45:04.440]  you're a very strong voice to me and and a lot of my close friends here we've
[1:45:04.440 --> 1:45:07.880]  actually started a small group here uh together of
[1:45:07.880 --> 1:45:11.240]  basically like-minded people that that get together when we've been talking
[1:45:11.240 --> 1:45:14.040]  about current political issues trying to keep all of us
[1:45:14.040 --> 1:45:18.200]  you know uh informed because there's just too much info out there for me myself
[1:45:18.200 --> 1:45:21.960]  to to learn and and everybody so we we've got a little group together to do that
[1:45:21.960 --> 1:45:26.360]  i wanted to ask you what would be some good advice that you might be able to
[1:45:26.360 --> 1:45:30.200]  pass down that that somebody like myself about position not have a lot of money
[1:45:30.200 --> 1:45:33.320]  or or or or you know life experience whatnot
[1:45:33.320 --> 1:45:37.160]  that i would be able to do to get more people involved and more people together
[1:45:37.160 --> 1:45:41.240]  sir put put ads on craigslist that you're forming sons of liberty
[1:45:41.240 --> 1:45:44.520]  uh as a study group you know to politically come up with a plan to
[1:45:44.520 --> 1:45:48.200]  try to make sure liberty is safe and freedom is there in your town
[1:45:48.200 --> 1:45:51.960]  or your city and then if you build it they will come just get involved it
[1:45:51.960 --> 1:45:55.640]  isn't about money it isn't about having you know a silver tongue
[1:45:55.640 --> 1:45:59.160]  it's about having guts and guts being enough and getting involved
[1:45:59.160 --> 1:46:03.880]  and putting one foot in front of the other it it's initiating the zenith
[1:46:03.880 --> 1:46:07.560]  it's initiating the genesis it's it's it's initiating

[1:47:51.080 --> 1:47:55.800]  rifleman in this country and trying to reeducate the public
[1:47:55.800 --> 1:47:58.760]  that they've been brainwashed against the second amendment so that's what we're
[1:47:58.760 --> 1:48:01.240]  doing here betty martini hadn't been on the show in years but i've interviewed

[1:48:05.320 --> 1:48:10.760]  someone single-mindedly taking action in the last few decades she has
[1:48:10.760 --> 1:48:13.560]  woken up millions of people but on international tv
[1:48:13.560 --> 1:48:18.360]  radio thousands of times at international tv scores of times
[1:48:18.360 --> 1:48:22.520]  with her website about aspartame the doctors the scientists the research
[1:48:22.520 --> 1:48:26.920]  she's brought together just handing out hundreds of thousands of
[1:48:26.920 --> 1:48:30.360]  pamphlets about aspartame known as neutrosuiter equal just how
[1:48:30.360 --> 1:48:32.920]  deadly it is all the scientific evidence the brain
[1:48:32.920 --> 1:48:36.600]  tumors the excitotoxin the endocrine disruptor
[1:48:36.600 --> 1:48:39.880]  tore a lot of governments abandoned a lot of countries now put warning labels
[1:48:39.880 --> 1:48:43.240]  the u.s doesn't yet but you know now they've
[1:48:43.240 --> 1:48:47.000]  are putting it in thousands and thousands of products and and not even
[1:48:47.000 --> 1:48:50.120]  listing it as aspartame you can't buy at any major store
[1:48:50.120 --> 1:48:53.640]  bubblegum or chewing gum that doesn't have it even when it's
[1:48:53.640 --> 1:48:58.600]  not artificial you know even when it says regular sugar not sugar free they're
[1:48:58.600 --> 1:49:01.560]  adding aspartame how is that happening why is that happening
[1:49:01.560 --> 1:49:05.880]  betty it's great to have you back on with us it certainly has been a long time
[1:49:05.880 --> 1:49:09.240]  alex but i'm so glad to talk to you again and
[1:49:09.240 --> 1:49:13.240]  i remember how we started out many many years ago
[1:49:13.240 --> 1:49:17.240]  and there really is a lot going on about aspartame today in the world
[1:49:17.240 --> 1:49:19.880]  okay we're gonna break in a moment i'm gonna give you the floor for the 40
[1:49:19.880 --> 1:49:22.840]  50 minutes we've got with you today we're gonna be back up with dr blalock
[1:49:22.840 --> 1:49:25.320]  soon because i'm gonna have it really covered this in years i'm gonna get
[1:49:25.320 --> 1:49:28.920]  back into it with all the melamine news and the plastic
[1:49:28.920 --> 1:49:33.640]  toxins news and the lead in the toys news that is all dwarfed by the aspartame
[1:49:33.640 --> 1:49:36.920]  and so uh just recap how you got involved in this we're gonna come back
[1:49:36.920 --> 1:49:40.040]  what is aspartame a brief snapshot of its history
[1:49:40.040 --> 1:49:45.160]  and where we currently are
[1:49:45.160 --> 1:49:47.880]  betty so go ahead and i tell us a little bit about yourself for folks that
[1:49:47.880 --> 1:49:51.480]  don't know you okay uh first of all i'm the founder of
[1:49:51.480 --> 1:49:56.120]  mission possible international which is a global volunteer force i work with
[1:49:56.120 --> 1:49:59.400]  world experts we have operations today in 30 down
[1:49:59.400 --> 1:50:05.640]  nations everybody working free to uh to warn the world about aspartame
[1:50:05.640 --> 1:50:09.720]  that started out many years ago i think i've been doing this
[1:50:09.720 --> 1:50:13.720]  now close to 17 years never thought it would take this long
[1:50:13.720 --> 1:50:17.000]  when someone almost died from aspartame
[1:50:17.000 --> 1:50:22.440]  um after being diagnosed with parkinson's when i met dr hj robert
[1:50:22.440 --> 1:50:26.600]  who explained aspartame not only can precipitate parkinson's but interacts
[1:50:26.600 --> 1:50:30.280]  with el dopa and uh he was probably drinking a diet
[1:50:30.280 --> 1:50:34.200]  coke with his el dopa which is exactly what he was doing
[1:50:34.200 --> 1:50:38.840]  and after reading his first book and finding out about the ms issue and
[1:50:38.840 --> 1:50:44.040]  seizures i would get people off of aspartame and their seizures would stop
[1:50:44.040 --> 1:50:48.200]  the ms people would walk out of wheelchairs and uh
[1:50:48.200 --> 1:50:51.640]  today there's even been a movie made about it all right betty stay there
[1:50:51.640 --> 1:50:54.840]  stay there got you on late we apologize for that you'll have plenty of time to
[1:50:54.840 --> 1:50:59.080]  break this down a wonderful hero in a fight for health betty martini stay
[1:50:59.080 --> 1:51:02.920]  doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in
[1:51:02.920 --> 1:51:05.800]  a ph balanced alkaline environment but as you know
[1:51:05.800 --> 1:51:10.440]  most people are overly acidic due to stress acidic diet and lack of exercise
[1:51:10.440 --> 1:51:13.960]  ph balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health
[1:51:13.960 --> 1:51:17.880]  as well as prevention of disease people who alkalize the water they drink

[1:54:34.840 --> 1:54:39.480]  gotten nations to ban it take it out of the food and drinks not here though
[1:54:39.480 --> 1:54:42.920]  okay betty you got the floor i roll through the basics of what it is the
[1:54:42.920 --> 1:54:46.360]  studies the fight where it currently is
[1:54:46.360 --> 1:54:49.560]  being used and put into thousands of foods today
[1:54:49.560 --> 1:54:53.640]  okay first of all uh as i was saying there's now a movie about it called
[1:54:53.640 --> 1:54:58.200]  sweet misery of poison world and i can remember when quarry bracket called me
[1:54:58.200 --> 1:55:02.120]  she uh was in a wheelchair she had gained a
[1:55:02.120 --> 1:55:06.280]  great deal of weight she couldn't walk she could barely talk she was
[1:55:06.280 --> 1:55:09.480]  diagnosed with one of the largest lesions ever
[1:55:09.480 --> 1:55:13.320]  diagnosed in an aspartame victim and she said
[1:55:13.320 --> 1:55:16.840]  she had walked out of her wheelchair she was fine she said a movie needs to be
[1:55:16.840 --> 1:55:20.280]  made about it i said tell me about it she said honey i owned the i owned the
[1:55:20.280 --> 1:55:23.560]  film company and she went ahead to make sweet
[1:55:23.560 --> 1:55:27.160]  misery that you can get it found in curie
[1:55:27.160 --> 1:55:31.720]  dot tv and then it tells how this deadly
[1:55:31.720 --> 1:55:36.200]  addictive excitonural toxic carcinogenic drug that interacts with
[1:55:36.200 --> 1:55:40.200]  virtually all drugs and vaccines got on the market
[1:55:40.200 --> 1:55:44.200]  and what happened was sir was the original manufacturer
[1:55:44.200 --> 1:55:48.760]  and um they couldn't take a poison and make it safe
[1:55:48.760 --> 1:55:56.680]  so they got caught and the fda asked um u.s prosecutor sam skinner to indict
[1:55:56.680 --> 1:56:00.440]  them for fraud and instead he went to work for
[1:56:00.440 --> 1:56:03.800]  sitley and austin which is uh their defense team
[1:56:03.800 --> 1:56:08.120]  so they asked prosecutor william conlon to indict him and he too went to work
[1:56:08.120 --> 1:56:12.280]  for him so the fda uh still would not approve it
[1:56:12.280 --> 1:56:18.040]  and revoke the petition in 1980 and you'll find the actual 50 page report
[1:56:18.040 --> 1:56:23.640]  on www.mpwhine.com now the interesting thing here it
[1:56:23.640 --> 1:56:26.920]  almost sounds like a story out of the twilight zone
[1:56:26.920 --> 1:56:33.480]  is that sirl had hired don rumsfield as CEO of sirl to clean up this mess
[1:56:33.480 --> 1:56:37.480]  and don rumsfield said he would call in his markers
[1:56:37.480 --> 1:56:41.080]  and get aspartame on the market no matter so
[1:56:41.080 --> 1:56:45.400]  the day after they revoke the petition
[1:56:45.400 --> 1:56:48.680]  which would have been signed into law in 30 days
[1:56:48.680 --> 1:56:55.800]  uh sirl sued the fda to keep it from being signed rumsfield was
[1:56:55.800 --> 1:57:01.800]  on president reagan's transition team and he owed rumsfield a favor
[1:57:01.800 --> 1:57:06.200]  because he had promised to nominate him for vice president instead nominated
[1:57:06.200 --> 1:57:12.600]  bush so here's what he did he had the transition team
[1:57:12.600 --> 1:57:19.240]  someone from them to call uh the fda commissioner jerry goryan at three in
[1:57:19.240 --> 1:57:23.720]  the morning and fire him because he was going to sign it into law
[1:57:23.720 --> 1:57:27.400]  and uh we have the letter from his wife on the website
[1:57:27.400 --> 1:57:34.760]  then um he appointed dr arthur hall hayes to do the deadly deed but he knew
[1:57:34.760 --> 1:57:39.800]  that it would take 30 days to get him to the fda and that would be too
[1:57:39.800 --> 1:57:44.360]  late so he wrote an executive order making the fda
[1:57:44.360 --> 1:57:48.280]  powerless to do anything about aspartame until he got there
[1:57:48.280 --> 1:57:53.000]  when he got there he overruled the board of inquiry
[1:57:53.000 --> 1:57:55.880]  got aspartame on the market and then went to work
[1:57:55.880 --> 1:58:00.360]  for the pr agency of the manufacturer for a thousand dollars a day on a
[1:58:00.360 --> 1:58:06.680]  uh tenure contract so he sold his soul for 365 million dollars
[1:58:06.680 --> 1:58:10.840]  and now today aspartame disease has become
[1:58:10.840 --> 1:58:16.200]  a global plague and a medical tax by dr roberts has been written
[1:58:16.200 --> 1:58:20.120]  that's over a thousand pages of the horrors
[1:58:20.120 --> 1:58:24.600]  neurodegenerative diseases and cancers okay that it causes a betty we've got a
[1:58:24.600 --> 1:58:28.360]  break when we come back let's there's thousands of studies as you now
[1:58:28.360 --> 1:58:30.760]  get into what they did with the monkeys covering it up that they killed the
[1:58:30.760 --> 1:58:34.280]  monkeys in the test rumsfeld covering it up how many foods and
[1:58:34.280 --> 1:58:40.760]  drinks it's actually in and how we stop it back in 70 seconds stay with us
[1:58:40.760 --> 1:58:49.480]  you are listening to gcn visit gcnlive.com today
[1:58:49.480 --> 1:58:54.280]  a day unlike any other in the long course of american history a terrorist act of

[1:59:09.320 --> 1:59:12.680]  ties to intelligence networks inside the united states
[1:59:12.680 --> 1:59:16.840]  some u.s investigators believe that their israelis again very much engaged in
[1:59:16.840 --> 1:59:21.960]  spying in and on the u.s i'm aware that some israeli citizens
[1:59:21.960 --> 1:59:25.160]  have been detained in laden's connections to the cia
[1:59:25.160 --> 1:59:28.600]  the hijackers ties to the fbi the saudi arabian connection
[1:59:28.600 --> 1:59:31.880]  the israeli intelligence network warnings and war games the shadow
[1:59:31.880 --> 1:59:34.760]  government and much much more fabled enemies

[2:00:08.200 --> 2:00:10.440]  website some of the other good sites to go to
[2:00:10.440 --> 2:00:14.600]  it's all documented government documents government studies letters
[2:00:14.600 --> 2:00:18.360]  reports everything she says is documented
[2:00:18.360 --> 2:00:22.840]  an amazing researcher she started out 17 years ago fighting this nobody was
[2:00:22.840 --> 2:00:26.200]  talking about it and she really single-handedly started
[2:00:26.200 --> 2:00:30.200]  ignited the fire has now gotten banned restricted in nations
[2:00:30.200 --> 2:00:33.960]  and saved undoubtedly tens of millions of people it's got to feel good
[2:00:33.960 --> 2:00:37.160]  and it's another example of what good people can do
[2:00:37.160 --> 2:00:41.080]  when they take action against evil who are the other betty martini's out there
[2:00:41.080 --> 2:00:43.880]  on other issues the second amendment open borders
[2:00:43.880 --> 2:00:47.480]  gmo crops fighting the new world order
[2:00:47.480 --> 2:00:50.680]  where are the other alex jones is out there look at all i've been able to do
[2:00:50.680 --> 2:00:54.920]  thanks to you spreading the word all right betty martini
[2:00:54.920 --> 2:00:57.720]  again these are some short segments here at the end of the hour long segment
[2:00:57.720 --> 2:00:59.800]  coming up we're going to break in about five minutes
[2:00:59.800 --> 2:01:03.480]  please continue rolling with with what aspartame is
[2:01:03.480 --> 2:01:06.920]  you gave us some of the history of how it got in and then now that it's lost
[2:01:06.920 --> 2:01:11.000]  it's patent it's been put in tens of thousands of things that we know of
[2:01:11.000 --> 2:01:14.760]  okay and i'm going to brought up the monkey study first of all
[2:01:14.760 --> 2:01:20.760]  aspartame is 40 percent of spartic acid and which is an
[2:01:20.760 --> 2:01:25.480]  excitotoxin and stimulates neurons of the brain to death causing brain damage
[2:01:25.480 --> 2:01:27.880]  and dr russell boylock wrote the book
[2:01:27.880 --> 2:01:32.440]  excitotoxins that taste the kills then it has a methyl ester
[2:01:32.440 --> 2:01:37.160]  which immediately becomes a free methyl alcohol
[2:01:37.160 --> 2:01:41.080]  which is a severe metabolic poison converts to formaldehyde
[2:01:41.080 --> 2:01:47.080]  causes metabolic acidosis there's 50 percent phenyl alanine which
[2:01:47.080 --> 2:01:52.120]  which is an isolate is a neurotoxin floods the brain lowers the seizure
[2:01:52.120 --> 2:01:55.640]  threshold to plead serotonin and causes
[2:01:55.640 --> 2:02:01.000]  psychiatric and behavioral problems then interacts with all antidepressants
[2:02:01.000 --> 2:02:05.000]  the whole molecule breaks down to tachytochiparazine which is a brain
[2:02:05.000 --> 2:02:09.160]  tumor agent which triggered brain tumors in original studies
[2:02:09.160 --> 2:02:13.240]  so everything about the molecule is poison
[2:02:13.240 --> 2:02:17.320]  and it's genetically engineered all of it now
[2:02:17.320 --> 2:02:21.400]  um the monkey study that you're referring to there's
[2:02:21.400 --> 2:02:24.920]  a little more on this now was actually pivotal
[2:02:24.920 --> 2:02:30.280]  in the approval of aspartame it was a 52 week oral toxicity study done on
[2:02:30.280 --> 2:02:35.560]  seven infant monkeys that aspartame five had grand mal seizures
[2:02:35.560 --> 2:02:39.720]  one died and they actually used that in the approval
[2:02:39.720 --> 2:02:45.000]  of aspartame now something about that is as it as it explains in dr
[2:02:45.000 --> 2:02:49.160]  robert's medical text is that it interacts
[2:02:49.160 --> 2:02:53.080]  with all anti seizure medication sometimes even after
[2:02:53.080 --> 2:02:57.960]  the patient is off of aspartame but what is going on now
[2:02:57.960 --> 2:03:01.480]  is that they are beginning to put aspartame
[2:03:01.480 --> 2:03:06.680]  and the very products used to treat the problems that it causes for instance
[2:03:06.680 --> 2:03:11.000]  um uh and informant from Pfizer called
[2:03:11.000 --> 2:03:16.760]  and said they had reformulated dialatin and had put aspartame in it and
[2:03:16.760 --> 2:03:20.760]  indeed people are complaining of more seizures and many
[2:03:20.760 --> 2:03:26.280]  uh reactions that aspartame causes uh such as male sexual dysfunction and all
[2:03:26.280 --> 2:03:29.240]  division changes i mean it's an accelerant but but we're
[2:03:29.240 --> 2:03:31.640]  about to break let's go back and then we'll come back and get into the monkey
[2:03:31.640 --> 2:03:34.680]  study and what you're covering now and it's not just Betty martini saying this
[2:03:34.680 --> 2:03:39.480]  all the medical doctors and and and and brain surgeons and and toxicologists
[2:03:39.480 --> 2:03:42.280]  you've got on your team and it's all documented on your website we'll give
[2:03:42.280 --> 2:03:46.200]  that out but going back yeah tell them how they make
[2:03:46.200 --> 2:03:49.880]  aspartame when you mentioned that it's uh you know uh biologically engineered
[2:03:49.880 --> 2:03:54.440]  explain that to them well um it's interesting
[2:03:54.440 --> 2:04:01.320]  that it um that dr bill deagle uh worked
[2:04:01.320 --> 2:04:07.480]  uh across from the aspartame factory and he has seen all these
[2:04:07.480 --> 2:04:14.360]  um uh vats of this black toxic uh sludge and he said that he was uh they
[2:04:14.360 --> 2:04:18.920]  were told at the hospital not to mention the things that it was causing
[2:04:18.920 --> 2:04:23.800]  and uh that they actually insert genes into it it's cultured only co-life
[2:04:23.800 --> 2:04:27.400]  and he said then it's pressed into a white powder
[2:04:27.400 --> 2:04:33.880]  and it is um you know it's chipped out and and then made into uh the actual
[2:04:33.880 --> 2:04:37.720]  neutrosweet product and we have the material safety
[2:04:37.720 --> 2:04:44.280]  data sheet on wnho.net and it's um you actually
[2:04:44.280 --> 2:04:50.440]  have to wear protective clothing even to go into the plant and stop right there
[2:04:50.440 --> 2:04:52.840]  i'm gonna skip this break we're gonna keep talking right now to come back to
[2:04:52.840 --> 2:04:56.520]  our body else in just three minutes with batty martini

[2:08:07.240 --> 2:08:10.920]  Betty martini is our guest you can read all the government reports and private
[2:08:10.920 --> 2:08:14.280]  studies and others at her website she'll give me her site and some other
[2:08:14.280 --> 2:08:18.520]  sites here in just a moment in fact Betty do that now and then
[2:08:18.520 --> 2:08:21.720]  let's get into how many products aspartame is really in
[2:08:21.720 --> 2:08:25.240]  what we know what other governments are saying they know it does
[2:08:25.240 --> 2:08:28.360]  for those that have problems dealing with this there have been all sorts of
[2:08:28.360 --> 2:08:31.080]  drugs and chemicals they've said aren't bad for you that turn out causing
[2:08:31.080 --> 2:08:35.240]  problems and they remove them but not now comes out that the chemicals in most
[2:08:35.240 --> 2:08:37.880]  plastics are estrogen mimicking and endocrine
[2:08:37.880 --> 2:08:41.880]  disruptors they just keep it in the market it's killed tens of thousands
[2:08:41.880 --> 2:08:45.480]  hundreds of thousands sick now in china from melamine
[2:08:45.480 --> 2:08:49.560]  coming into the u.s china says it's bad executes people that put it in
[2:08:49.560 --> 2:08:53.000]  our government says no problem with melamine just like with aspartame
[2:08:53.000 --> 2:08:57.080]  they say mercury is good for children in shots when all these major universities
[2:08:57.080 --> 2:09:00.520]  show it is the most destructive heavy metal to brain tissue causes electro
[2:09:00.520 --> 2:09:03.560]  chemical literally short circuits and explosions
[2:09:03.560 --> 2:09:07.000]  it just keeps cutting through the nerves and causes well you can see it
[2:09:07.000 --> 2:09:09.800]  under an electron microscope they're electrochemical it literally is a
[2:09:09.800 --> 2:09:13.080]  little explosions in the brain little electrical
[2:09:13.080 --> 2:09:16.280]  shorts going on so we have them telling us all these
[2:09:16.280 --> 2:09:20.120]  poisons are so great but i can think of no poison worldwide as prolific as
[2:09:20.120 --> 2:09:23.240]  aspartame in the u.s sodium fluoride and its derivatives and
[2:09:23.240 --> 2:09:25.880]  subgroups in the water is probably worse than aspartame
[2:09:25.880 --> 2:09:29.480]  is because everybody's exposed to it and all the studies but with aspartame
[2:09:29.480 --> 2:09:32.360]  worldwide and in the u.s secondarily probably the most
[2:09:32.360 --> 2:09:34.840]  destructive thing we're dealing with please continue
[2:09:34.840 --> 2:09:38.120]  okay first of all i have in front of me the statement from dr
[2:09:38.120 --> 2:09:41.800]  deagle about how it's made and maybe this will help you understand
[2:09:41.800 --> 2:09:45.240]  he says most people when asked how aspartame is made do not have the first
[2:09:45.240 --> 2:09:49.560]  step of understanding while an er doctor and primary care physician in
[2:09:49.560 --> 2:09:54.120]  august in 87 and 88 i was told a number of interesting facts about the
[2:09:54.120 --> 2:09:58.200]  adjacent aspartame factory bacteria with genes inserted
[2:09:58.200 --> 2:10:01.400]  generate a sludge which is centrifuge to remove
[2:10:01.400 --> 2:10:05.480]  the aspartame in many hundreds of contaminant organic and amino acids are
[2:10:05.480 --> 2:10:08.600]  present we were told not to report illness
[2:10:08.600 --> 2:10:12.600]  uh... or workers compensation issues the fear of being fired by the hospital
[2:10:12.600 --> 2:10:16.680]  now the august region medical center many of their employees presented with
[2:10:16.680 --> 2:10:20.680]  psychiatric neuro neuroopathy conditions chronic
[2:10:20.680 --> 2:10:23.800]  fatigue and organic cases of loss of cognitive function
[2:10:23.800 --> 2:10:27.560]  this powder from the grad sludge when then transported for packaging and
[2:10:27.560 --> 2:10:31.800]  factories elsewhere in the u.s before sale is equal and now the myriad of
[2:10:31.800 --> 2:10:34.680]  names of this neuro toxin and he says they're just
[2:10:34.680 --> 2:10:38.520]  bats of toxic sludge and that's what someone told me in the augusta
[2:10:38.520 --> 2:10:42.120]  uh... factory where somebody dropped dead from it from not wearing
[2:10:42.120 --> 2:10:45.560]  protective clothing what's going on in the uh...
[2:10:45.560 --> 2:10:50.200]  around the world now i lectured in new zealand when abby cormac
[2:10:50.200 --> 2:10:54.360]  almost died from wriggly aspartame gum and i want to warn people
[2:10:54.360 --> 2:10:58.760]  because after a suit was filed against them because of this in 2004
[2:10:58.760 --> 2:11:02.120]  although it was they got out of it wriggly's
[2:11:02.120 --> 2:11:06.520]  error gory turned around and put it in all but two of their gums
[2:11:06.520 --> 2:11:12.280]  it is the most dangerous product because as dr robert's wrote a paper on it
[2:11:12.280 --> 2:11:16.280]  it works like nitroglycerin under the tongue goes through saliva
[2:11:16.280 --> 2:11:21.880]  straight to the brain and uh... they were about to diagnose her with bipolar
[2:11:21.880 --> 2:11:24.760]  until she found out and i went over and lectured in the
[2:11:24.760 --> 2:11:29.000]  medical schools and now they are petitioning for the band in new zealand
[2:11:29.000 --> 2:11:33.080]  uh... in the philippines uh... in fact i just happened to meet their
[2:11:33.080 --> 2:11:37.160]  councilman uh... who is trying to get it banned there i
[2:11:37.160 --> 2:11:39.800]  uh... talked to the california board of medicine
[2:11:39.800 --> 2:11:43.880]  and uh... he came in from the philippines and talked about what was going on
[2:11:43.880 --> 2:11:46.680]  there correctly by the way let me stop you i just
[2:11:46.680 --> 2:11:50.120]  looked up how aspartame has made them on university websites
[2:11:50.120 --> 2:11:53.640]  and it says it is a organic as a whole bunch of these
[2:11:53.640 --> 2:11:57.320]  uh... a a organic fermentation process so what
[2:11:57.320 --> 2:12:00.920]  what what deagle said i mean i've read this before separately
[2:12:00.920 --> 2:12:04.280]  but i mean if you just google it it's on university sites
[2:12:04.280 --> 2:12:08.360]  and it says they ferment it like beer so it is bacteria
[2:12:08.360 --> 2:12:11.400]  going on yeah it's made from bacteria yes
[2:12:11.400 --> 2:12:15.560]  uh... pretty well known now uh... the recently
[2:12:15.560 --> 2:12:20.840]  uh... now it's it's been two or three years uh... parliament
[2:12:20.840 --> 2:12:25.000]  uh... there were forty one here it is genetically engineered bacteria
[2:12:25.000 --> 2:12:29.800]  which are fed these uh... uh... altered amino acids
[2:12:29.800 --> 2:12:33.080]  and over the course of three days the amino acids are harvested the bacteria
[2:12:33.080 --> 2:12:37.080]  destroyed yeah it's true oh my god i'm reading the actual
[2:12:37.080 --> 2:12:41.640]  there's photos of this oh my god yeah okay go ahead i wanted
[2:12:41.640 --> 2:12:46.600]  go ahead yes it's absolutely in the records now
[2:12:46.600 --> 2:12:51.400]  um... but anyway forty seven members of parliament signed for a ban
[2:12:51.400 --> 2:12:54.680]  so now the european food safety authority
[2:12:54.680 --> 2:12:59.240]  is now doing another review which will end in january
[2:12:59.240 --> 2:13:03.960]  and uh... it would just be wonderful if we could get it banned in europe
[2:13:03.960 --> 2:13:09.160]  um... we did cry in hawaii uh... last year
[2:13:09.160 --> 2:13:14.120]  and we had problems with it but uh... we are trying to get a co-sponsor now to
[2:13:14.120 --> 2:13:17.000]  go back through the hawaii legislature
[2:13:17.000 --> 2:13:21.480]  and uh... then i testified for the new mexico
[2:13:21.480 --> 2:13:24.920]  uh... house and senate when they tried to ban it
[2:13:24.920 --> 2:13:29.640]  and the uh... capital was just saturated with lobbyists
[2:13:29.640 --> 2:13:33.560]  but they're going to try to do that again this year so even states in the
[2:13:33.560 --> 2:13:36.600]  united states are crying to ban it
[2:13:36.600 --> 2:13:43.640]  now here's one of the problems in 2002 i wrote a citizen's petition for ban
[2:13:43.640 --> 2:13:49.160]  uh... you can find it on the FDA website 190 pages of evidence
[2:13:49.160 --> 2:13:54.040]  and uh... the law states that they must answer it in 180 days
[2:13:54.040 --> 2:13:58.040]  and they have refused to do it i mean it's been six and a half years
[2:13:58.040 --> 2:14:01.240]  and the reason they refused to serve above the law
[2:14:01.240 --> 2:14:04.920]  is i'm using their own government doctors documents and what they said
[2:14:04.920 --> 2:14:09.000]  themselves they can't answer it so an attorney told me to go ahead and
[2:14:09.000 --> 2:14:12.440]  file an amendment as an imminent health hazard
[2:14:12.440 --> 2:14:17.160]  and i did that in october that's required by law to be answered within a week
[2:14:17.160 --> 2:14:20.120]  or 10 days and they refused to answer that
[2:14:20.120 --> 2:14:23.480]  that's the big problem no matter who does it
[2:14:23.480 --> 2:14:28.760]  uh... the community nutrition institute petition the FDA to ban it in 86
[2:14:28.760 --> 2:14:32.760]  because so many people were going blind from the free mental alcohol and having
[2:14:32.760 --> 2:14:36.440]  diseases and they took it all the way to the supreme court
[2:14:36.440 --> 2:14:39.560]  yeah let me stop you i'm looking at the manufacturing process here from the
[2:14:39.560 --> 2:14:42.680]  university website we'll put up on screen later they admit
[2:14:42.680 --> 2:14:46.600]  they take aspheric acid and phenylalanine
[2:14:46.600 --> 2:14:51.080]  combine it in tanks then put back genetically modified bacteria in
[2:14:51.080 --> 2:14:54.920]  then put it into a crystal separator and then dry it and uh... into a white
[2:14:54.920 --> 2:14:57.400]  powder after separating the dead bacteria
[2:14:57.400 --> 2:15:01.480]  and uh... it's admitted that i mean they admit mainstream i'm looking at it that
[2:15:01.480 --> 2:15:05.880]  once it hits 87 degrees it breaks back into the wood alcohol your body
[2:15:05.880 --> 2:15:11.160]  is what 98 degrees i mean this is insane i mean i i mean uh...
[2:15:11.160 --> 2:15:14.600]  antifreeze is sweet why don't we just start putting that in gum and
[2:15:14.600 --> 2:15:20.280]  answer that question and then going back to this why now can't i buy any major
[2:15:20.280 --> 2:15:23.640]  bubble gum and i can go to the shopping center i can go to
[2:15:23.640 --> 2:15:27.160]  a major grocery store because i like gum sometimes
[2:15:27.160 --> 2:15:30.600]  you know for breath or whatever and i can't find one i have to order it
[2:15:30.600 --> 2:15:33.000]  special online that doesn't say aspartame
[2:15:33.000 --> 2:15:36.520]  well let me give you a little bit of good news first of all
[2:15:36.520 --> 2:15:41.080]  i was talking to someone who makes herbs from the amazon rainforest some years
[2:15:41.080 --> 2:15:43.960]  ago and i said look it doesn't take a
[2:15:43.960 --> 2:15:48.280]  uh... rocket scientist to make a safe sweetener and these these products are
[2:15:48.280 --> 2:15:51.560]  killing diabetics and he turned around and made it
[2:15:51.560 --> 2:15:55.000]  and it's called just like sugar and it has
[2:15:55.000 --> 2:16:00.120]  a chicory which has been used for 70 years to improve the health of diabetics
[2:16:00.120 --> 2:16:03.880]  and uh... orange peel vitamin c
[2:16:03.880 --> 2:16:08.840]  uh... and calcium and then dr boylock asked that it be analyzed and he wrote
[2:16:08.840 --> 2:16:12.840]  in his uh... newsletter the boylock wellness report
[2:16:12.840 --> 2:16:18.680]  finally finally a safe sweetener and i talked to the uh...
[2:16:18.680 --> 2:16:23.000]  ceo and i said look so many people are having
[2:16:23.000 --> 2:16:26.200]  uh... the problems with the gum they're putting it in everything and it's the
[2:16:26.200 --> 2:16:29.800]  most dangerous product and he said i promise you by the end of
[2:16:29.800 --> 2:16:35.240]  December we will have a gum free of aspartame made with just like sugar
[2:16:35.240 --> 2:16:39.800]  and i said why you're at it how about you know on every restaurant table
[2:16:39.800 --> 2:16:43.960]  uh... they have splenda which is the chlorocarbon poison
[2:16:43.960 --> 2:16:46.920]  and equal and he says then we'll make packets
[2:16:46.920 --> 2:16:50.680]  so i have no financial association of course with the company
[2:16:50.680 --> 2:16:57.080]  but uh... they uh... they are getting this month a congressional award for
[2:16:57.080 --> 2:16:59.800]  making the first safe sweetener in america
[2:16:59.800 --> 2:17:03.000]  so i'm glad with all this bad news to give you a little bit
[2:17:03.000 --> 2:17:06.840]  good news that there will be a gum that's safe because
[2:17:06.840 --> 2:17:10.120]  even some of the wriggly gums that have aspartame in it
[2:17:10.120 --> 2:17:15.240]  they have uh... also have splenda in it they have a sulfene potassium which
[2:17:15.240 --> 2:17:17.960]  caused cancer and leukemia and original
[2:17:17.960 --> 2:17:23.800]  original uh... uh... studies and there was a study in
[2:17:23.800 --> 2:17:27.800]  liverpo that told about you know the combination of all of these
[2:17:27.800 --> 2:17:30.920]  poisons i mean it's just really a chemical
[2:17:30.920 --> 2:17:34.360]  feast and uh... just destroying the brains of our
[2:17:34.360 --> 2:17:37.240]  children reducing IQ well what we have is chemical
[2:17:37.240 --> 2:17:40.440]  companies getting rid of soap and giving us toxic byproducts of the oil
[2:17:40.440 --> 2:17:43.880]  industry which is detergents what we have is the chemical
[2:17:43.880 --> 2:17:47.640]  companies and bio companies getting rid of our sugar and giving us this
[2:17:47.640 --> 2:17:51.080]  this chemical weapon they're replacing everything
[2:17:51.080 --> 2:17:55.240]  with their poison and then they own the medical system uh... that then misdiagnoses
[2:17:55.240 --> 2:17:58.040]  this and controls people why don't you bet he's for getting into
[2:17:58.040 --> 2:18:01.880]  all the doctors and scientists and governors and and and i mean governments
[2:18:01.880 --> 2:18:05.160]  that have come out and and admitted that this is so bad
[2:18:05.160 --> 2:18:09.480]  well we've we've got all we've basically got all that we're all those records in
[2:18:09.480 --> 2:18:14.120]  fact um... if you really want to know about this study one of the
[2:18:14.120 --> 2:18:18.600]  best articles ever written it's on mpwhi.com
[2:18:18.600 --> 2:18:23.720]  is the ecologist they did a seventeen page cover story it's got
[2:18:23.720 --> 2:18:29.720]  uh... rumsfield's name on the front of it and starts out by telling you that
[2:18:29.720 --> 2:18:33.880]  originally aspartame was listed with the pentagon in an inventory of
[2:18:33.880 --> 2:18:37.480]  prospective biochemical warfare weapons submitted to congress
[2:18:37.480 --> 2:18:41.320]  oh and it accidentally gotten all the food all like everything else
[2:18:41.320 --> 2:18:45.160]  oh oh and so you don't have relation control
[2:18:45.160 --> 2:18:49.880]  i noticed the pentagon doesn't want to discuss it with me
[2:18:49.880 --> 2:18:54.200]  but uh... and you know we've had to start a mission possible aviation
[2:18:54.200 --> 2:18:58.680]  and the reason i did that was because of a pilot called me and he said dumb i'm
[2:18:58.680 --> 2:19:03.640]  not but i crashed my plane on aspartame i couldn't
[2:19:03.640 --> 2:19:07.480]  make a decision you know it it destroys memory which is one of the reason that
[2:19:07.480 --> 2:19:12.120]  it you know escalating all zammers and it causes confusion
[2:19:12.120 --> 2:19:15.560]  and so dr blade now saying you get aspartame
[2:19:15.560 --> 2:19:20.040]  Alzheimer's when you're 30 now oh yes you know in fact one of the hospices
[2:19:20.040 --> 2:19:23.880]  called me some years ago and asked why 30 euro people were getting it
[2:19:23.880 --> 2:19:27.640]  uh... you know what the reason that aspartame interacts with
[2:19:27.640 --> 2:19:32.680]  uh... most drugs is because of damage to the mitochondria or life itself
[2:19:32.680 --> 2:19:38.120]  and what that does is make you old and and aspartame knows no age you know
[2:19:38.120 --> 2:19:42.280]  that's right inside of the cells the engine of the cells in it and its
[2:19:42.280 --> 2:19:46.040]  programming is the mitochondrial dna and they're showing studies that it's
[2:19:46.040 --> 2:19:50.040]  damaging the very dna of the species batty let's continue speaking this is so

[2:24:21.240 --> 2:24:27.000]  populations and i've got the london independent here
[2:24:27.000 --> 2:24:33.880]  from the 20th of uh what july 1999 world's top sweetener is made with
[2:24:33.880 --> 2:24:39.800]  GM bacteria and it is a chemical weapon derived
[2:24:39.800 --> 2:24:43.640]  from a biological weapon mix and of course that's why
[2:24:43.640 --> 2:24:48.280]  it's in most your food you buy prepared because they're exterminating us i mean
[2:24:48.280 --> 2:24:52.680]  you can't imagine this you can't make this up you can't
[2:24:52.680 --> 2:24:56.840]  everything they do oh the GMO just so happens to sterilize the mice that eat
[2:24:56.840 --> 2:25:00.840]  and then if humans get it our fertility is dropping oh melamine just so happens
[2:25:00.840 --> 2:25:04.760]  to kill kids oh the one type of plastic they chose
[2:25:04.760 --> 2:25:07.000]  out of hundreds to be standardized the main plastic
[2:25:07.000 --> 2:25:10.920]  sterilizes people and gives you cancer oh oh and there's an you know
[2:25:10.920 --> 2:25:14.840]  there's an army report on that army figures this out

[2:25:18.120 --> 2:25:22.520]  involved no it's the eugenicist it's the eugenicist and that's why

[2:25:29.400 --> 2:25:34.520]  Betty martini uh please continue okay uh when you mention that article i have
[2:25:34.520 --> 2:25:38.280]  to tell you a story about that written by the on the front page of the
[2:25:38.280 --> 2:25:41.800]  independent not only on the front page but above
[2:25:41.800 --> 2:25:45.320]  the royal wedding and the way that came to be
[2:25:45.320 --> 2:25:49.560]  is that one of the aspartame uh companies
[2:25:49.560 --> 2:25:53.480]  actually had on their website the formula
[2:25:53.480 --> 2:25:59.000]  uh for genetic engineering and people just didn't realize what it was and i
[2:25:59.000 --> 2:26:03.000]  was talking to the independent and i told them i said you know you people
[2:26:03.000 --> 2:26:05.880]  don't like genetic engineering why don't you help us with
[2:26:05.880 --> 2:26:09.560]  aspartame and they said prove it and we'll help you
[2:26:09.560 --> 2:26:13.400]  and so uh when i put that online they immediately
[2:26:13.400 --> 2:26:17.240]  i took the website down but it was too late i had printed it out
[2:26:17.240 --> 2:26:20.520]  and faxed it to the independent in the uk
[2:26:20.520 --> 2:26:23.640]  and they kept their word put it on the front page
[2:26:23.640 --> 2:26:28.200]  above the royal wedding so that all of uh the uk
[2:26:28.200 --> 2:26:31.480]  to find out about yeah that's what they report is this is directly from the
[2:26:31.480 --> 2:26:34.680]  aspartame manufacturer so our source and this
[2:26:34.680 --> 2:26:37.640]  yeah monsanto could not deny it because there
[2:26:37.640 --> 2:26:42.360]  was on the website showing the actual formula for this
[2:26:42.360 --> 2:26:46.280]  and another thing i that people should know really worries me about what's
[2:26:46.280 --> 2:26:49.800]  happening to the vets because they're now
[2:26:49.800 --> 2:26:53.800]  reporting how many of them are going blind you know that's from aspartame
[2:26:53.800 --> 2:26:59.560]  but if you get on w n h o dot net and go back to 2003
[2:26:59.560 --> 2:27:03.800]  you can read a report i wrote the case for aspartame disease being go for
[2:27:03.800 --> 2:27:07.800]  illness and lew garrick because the government back then was saying you
[2:27:07.800 --> 2:27:11.640]  know they're crazy and then they did their own
[2:27:11.640 --> 2:27:16.280]  study and i had told them it causes it can precipitate ms and cause lew garrick
[2:27:16.280 --> 2:27:19.560]  uh dr james bowen has lew garrick's mass protein
[2:27:19.560 --> 2:27:23.560]  and when they did their own studies they found it was
[2:27:23.560 --> 2:27:28.360]  lew garrick so now you know they're chewing gum and drinking it in iraq
[2:27:28.360 --> 2:27:32.280]  here they are you know fighting for our country
[2:27:32.280 --> 2:27:36.520]  and you know being killed by aspartame well i mean
[2:27:36.520 --> 2:27:39.960]  you know i mentioned that i know this is a setup i mean i see the same story
[2:27:39.960 --> 2:27:43.160]  over and over again uh fighting this for 17 years interviewing
[2:27:43.160 --> 2:27:45.560]  scientists doctors all these government reports
[2:27:45.560 --> 2:27:49.160]  you know you helping get governments to ban it around the world are restricted
[2:27:49.160 --> 2:27:53.320]  i mean do you believe that this was done by design
[2:27:53.320 --> 2:28:00.520]  i well you know i cannot say i mean there's no way to say but i do know
[2:28:00.520 --> 2:28:05.320]  that furl knew it because i have talked to so many informants
[2:28:05.320 --> 2:28:08.760]  and people from furl they said they all knew that it was poison
[2:28:08.760 --> 2:28:12.040]  and they knew it before they put it on the market
[2:28:12.040 --> 2:28:16.680]  uh i mean the army discovers it and says it's a chemical weapon
[2:28:16.680 --> 2:28:20.200]  and uh and then they and then suddenly it's rumsfeld and it's in all our food i
[2:28:20.200 --> 2:28:24.600]  mean you know you know what they call it now rumsfeld plague
[2:28:24.600 --> 2:28:30.200]  that's right rumsfeld disease yes uh well um uh the medical
[2:28:30.200 --> 2:28:33.720]  taxes aspartame disease and dr robert says we're not going to
[2:28:33.720 --> 2:28:37.560]  call it rumsfeld disease because they usually honor doctors so it's called
[2:28:37.560 --> 2:28:42.440]  rumsfeld plague and the anaheim observer wrote a great
[2:28:42.440 --> 2:28:49.560]  fantastic article on biochemical weaponry and and rumsfield legacy
[2:28:49.560 --> 2:28:53.720]  and incidentally somebody has written a book
[2:28:53.720 --> 2:28:57.800]  on rumsfield that even even tells the whole story
[2:28:57.800 --> 2:29:01.960]  rumsfield is rise fall and catastrophic legacy well listen he's the one that
[2:29:01.960 --> 2:29:05.400]  gave nuclear reactors as the head of abb to north korea
[2:29:05.400 --> 2:29:08.760]  he's the one that got the terminator genes and gmo approved
[2:29:08.760 --> 2:29:12.040]  it's like whatever is evil he gave the bio weapons of sudan
[2:29:12.040 --> 2:29:15.240]  it's like a poop of smoke and he's like the devil and he's there at the scene of
[2:29:15.240 --> 2:29:18.920]  everything i know i know and this is uh they actually
[2:29:18.920 --> 2:29:22.760]  told this in fact i sent this to a lot of magazine when they interviewed me
[2:29:22.760 --> 2:29:26.360]  and they actually put this in their story right here
[2:29:26.360 --> 2:29:30.440]  in the home of coca-cola and when the uh reporter came out

[2:34:14.440 --> 2:34:17.560]  thousands and thousands of products i can't find gum that doesn't have it they
[2:34:17.560 --> 2:34:20.200]  call it natural unnatural sweeteners they won't let you they're
[2:34:20.200 --> 2:34:24.760]  camouflaging it uh now uh and they didn't know before they
[2:34:24.760 --> 2:34:28.840]  certainly know now it's deadly this this this army chemical weapon
[2:34:28.840 --> 2:34:33.320]  made out of genetically engineered bacteria they discovered in the 60s
[2:34:33.320 --> 2:34:37.960]  uh dealing with that issue finally and then briefly the addiction uh
[2:34:37.960 --> 2:34:40.680]  you know i had somebody down here this weekend who's a great guy but i was
[2:34:40.680 --> 2:34:43.560]  watching him addicted to diet cokes he had to have him he wanted me to run
[2:34:43.560 --> 2:34:46.840]  around and get him halls but he said they must be sugar-free
[2:34:46.840 --> 2:34:50.600]  and he was acting like a drug addict when i would bring him the aspartame
[2:34:50.600 --> 2:34:54.600]  uh and i've seen this with people who get off of aspartame and and and
[2:34:54.600 --> 2:34:58.680]  literally go through all sorts of withdrawals dr blaylock medical
[2:34:58.680 --> 2:35:02.280]  doctor and others have developed and you have this free on your website and
[2:35:02.280 --> 2:35:06.760]  give out those sites some systems that will help people detox this is a
[2:35:06.760 --> 2:35:11.480]  i mean like many poisons it's also very addictive
[2:35:11.480 --> 2:35:17.000]  quiet is addictive it's that free metal alcohol that causes chronic methanol poisoning
[2:35:17.000 --> 2:35:21.000]  this affects the dopamine uh the dopamine system of the brain and causes
[2:35:21.000 --> 2:35:25.160]  the addiction and you know one day i was talking with dr
[2:35:25.160 --> 2:35:28.600]  deagle about the fact that when people are that addicted they're
[2:35:28.600 --> 2:35:32.200]  no longer rational and he says well that's because it first affects the
[2:35:32.200 --> 2:35:36.280]  frontal lobes of the brain and it's like talking to somebody with a lobotomy
[2:35:36.280 --> 2:35:41.960]  and a very good case of that is uh lane short's wife when one of the doctors
[2:35:41.960 --> 2:35:46.040]  found out and said oh we have found out it's aspartame
[2:35:46.040 --> 2:35:49.560]  diabetics can't heal we can save your foot
[2:35:49.560 --> 2:35:54.120]  just get off of aspartame and she said i'm too addicted chop it off and they
[2:35:54.120 --> 2:35:58.040]  did and that is not rational but this is the
[2:35:58.040 --> 2:36:03.080]  problem that we have is um is is this addiction and dr
[2:36:03.080 --> 2:36:06.920]  arberts has written a very very long article about it that's on
[2:36:06.920 --> 2:36:10.920]  on the doorway under miscellaneous doctors speak out the town's the letter
[2:36:10.920 --> 2:36:15.320]  for doctor that explains it in great detail
[2:36:17.960 --> 2:36:20.760]  alex are you still there yes betty i'm just sitting back you know i have a
[2:36:20.760 --> 2:36:22.840]  penchant for interrupting so i wanted you to continue
[2:36:22.840 --> 2:36:28.120]  yeah so uh this is one of the most serious problems and if um
[2:36:28.120 --> 2:36:31.640]  if anyone uh you know gets in touch with us uh
[2:36:31.640 --> 2:36:35.480]  my email is bettym19 at minespring.com we can
[2:36:35.480 --> 2:36:39.960]  send them dr waylock's information about what they have to do they have to stay
[2:36:39.960 --> 2:36:43.960]  on my knees him the rest of their life because it protects the heart and the
[2:36:43.960 --> 2:36:48.680]  brain from excitotoxins and dr waylock says you have to flush your system out
[2:36:48.680 --> 2:36:54.440]  with distilled water you can't use you know chlorine or fluoride and he gave
[2:36:54.440 --> 2:36:59.080]  he gives a a great list of the things that could help and heal
[2:36:59.080 --> 2:37:03.960]  um the immune system and tells you all the things to avoid and it's a
[2:37:03.960 --> 2:37:09.240]  wonderful paper anybody on it really should get in touch and they can stay
[2:37:09.240 --> 2:37:13.560]  up to date on this list and they'll get all the information that they want and
[2:37:13.560 --> 2:37:18.040]  all the references and the the books and movies and anything that they need
[2:37:18.040 --> 2:37:21.880]  um that can help one of the greatest things is getting the information to
[2:37:21.880 --> 2:37:27.240]  the doctors because uh once a doctor knows uh then he can
[2:37:27.240 --> 2:37:31.960]  save the lives of thousands as like my neurologist said he when he realized
[2:37:31.960 --> 2:37:35.320]  who i was he said i had a patient he said having
[2:37:35.320 --> 2:37:38.680]  seizures he said that we tried everything there was on the market he had
[2:37:38.680 --> 2:37:42.680]  no idea that it interacts with all any seizure medication
[2:37:42.680 --> 2:37:47.720]  found out that she uh was drinking a case of diet coke a day got her off of it
[2:37:47.720 --> 2:37:50.920]  she went crazy she had to put her in a mental hospital
[2:37:50.920 --> 2:37:53.960]  two weeks out of the mental hospital she was off of
[2:37:53.960 --> 2:37:57.400]  aspartame no problems and the seizures stopped
[2:37:57.400 --> 2:38:01.480]  so it's very very important for it's a chemical weapon
[2:38:01.480 --> 2:38:05.880]  it's a chemical weapon betty martini we salute you we appreciate you
[2:38:05.880 --> 2:38:09.160]  for warning people and we'll talk to you soon thank you for spending time with
[2:38:09.160 --> 2:38:12.200]  us thank you alex you bet there she goes great
[2:38:12.200 --> 2:38:15.480]  lady we're going to be doing several more shows in a long series
[2:38:15.480 --> 2:38:20.600]  on this in the next three months because i'd cover this probably a hundred
[2:38:20.600 --> 2:38:24.440]  times five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve years ago and
[2:38:24.440 --> 2:38:27.320]  now we haven't covered it in so long i wanted to
[2:38:27.320 --> 2:38:30.600]  give you the evidence and yet again a government chemical weapon made by
[2:38:30.600 --> 2:38:34.760]  genetically engineered bacteria they know exactly what they're doing
[2:38:34.760 --> 2:38:38.200]  all right shifting gears uh enough respect
[2:38:38.200 --> 2:38:43.960]  website on youtube that we know of has 20 30 million you mean some of his videos
[2:38:43.960 --> 2:38:48.680]  have five six million views per short videos that he makes
[2:38:48.680 --> 2:38:54.680]  it's an absolutely amazing uh individual and then his videos get copied to
[2:38:54.680 --> 2:38:58.120]  hundreds of other video sharing sites and so
[2:38:58.120 --> 2:39:01.720]  really we don't know how many tens of millions more
[2:39:01.720 --> 2:39:05.720]  have seen his material just in two short years on the internet he lives in the
[2:39:05.720 --> 2:39:09.480]  united kingdom in cardiff he's made some great videos with my
[2:39:09.480 --> 2:39:11.880]  material that i've really been flattered that he's
[2:39:11.880 --> 2:39:17.480]  done that he has stood up for us when youtube and google
[2:39:17.480 --> 2:39:21.800]  have been censoring us banning our videos knocking our hit counts down to
[2:39:21.800 --> 2:39:25.160]  knock us out of the top ten so that people don't see us there on the
[2:39:25.160 --> 2:39:31.240]  front page of youtube or google uh he has put out videos uh he he won
[2:39:31.240 --> 2:39:34.680]  the three people that uh won we had three different contests he won one of
[2:39:34.680 --> 2:39:39.080]  the contests for the best internet censorship video a few months ago uh
[2:39:39.080 --> 2:39:44.840]  he won the first round of contest uh exposing uh the different cocktail the
[2:39:44.840 --> 2:39:47.880]  different ways there's a lot of different ways they're shutting down
[2:39:47.880 --> 2:39:51.480]  regulating the web uh obama has announced upgrading the internet that
[2:39:51.480 --> 2:39:55.800]  is internet to the consortium to start shutting down the old free open
[2:39:55.800 --> 2:39:58.760]  web that we told you about they're gonna free internet
[2:39:58.760 --> 2:40:02.040]  wireless nationwide with taxpayer money paying for it nothing's free
[2:40:02.040 --> 2:40:05.400]  it's going to be highly censored only a few thousand sites of the billions
[2:40:05.400 --> 2:40:08.600]  that you can actually visit uh canada's openly is saying they're
[2:40:08.600 --> 2:40:12.200]  going to restrict the web australia headline in their newspapers chinese
[2:40:12.200 --> 2:40:16.520]  style censorship banning all alternative sites basically
[2:40:16.520 --> 2:40:21.400]  it's here it's happening and uh he had all these top honors of top director in
[2:40:21.400 --> 2:40:25.240]  the uk you know one of the top directors in the u.s the most hits the most views
[2:40:25.240 --> 2:40:29.160]  you know he was uh you know up there in the top uh 20 in every category
[2:40:29.160 --> 2:40:35.480]  so they basically restricted him knocked him off the front page and again we
[2:40:35.480 --> 2:40:38.120]  don't care about having little blue ribbons for being number one we don't
[2:40:38.120 --> 2:40:42.680]  care about being on the front page for uh you know the fame or whatever it's
[2:40:42.680 --> 2:40:46.200]  that that's where the billions of people that visit youtube and google
[2:40:46.200 --> 2:40:50.200]  go to do their viewing it's like the tv guy
[2:40:50.200 --> 2:40:54.120]  we know they've been restricting my hit counts my views because when you upload
[2:40:54.120 --> 2:40:57.640]  a google video you can still see what your hits and views are when we
[2:40:57.640 --> 2:41:01.000]  complained a year ago about them knocking us from 10 million 20 million
[2:41:01.000 --> 2:41:04.520]  views on the video down to zero that build back up in millions in a day they'd
[2:41:04.520 --> 2:41:08.360]  knock it down again they just made those numbers secret unless you're the
[2:41:08.360 --> 2:41:10.600]  person that posted it you can still see it
[2:41:10.600 --> 2:41:13.800]  we saw them censor fabled enemies a few months ago when it came out
[2:41:13.800 --> 2:41:17.960]  it hit number one within two days and they just erased our numbers there was
[2:41:17.960 --> 2:41:21.560]  over a million views because we uploaded it we could see that
[2:41:21.560 --> 2:41:24.760]  only people that could us and google before it was public
[2:41:24.760 --> 2:41:28.680]  and a year ago they changed it and we saw them internally knock it off
[2:41:28.680 --> 2:41:31.960]  and we also got screenshots of them knocking us off the front page
[2:41:31.960 --> 2:41:35.880]  and i have asked uh you know people like enough respect
[2:41:35.880 --> 2:41:39.800]  being censored being cheated is horrible but it lets you know you're hurting
[2:41:39.800 --> 2:41:45.160]  them so and please enough respect do not leave youtube and all of you
[2:41:45.160 --> 2:41:47.720]  when you get attacked no it means you're hurting them
[2:41:47.720 --> 2:41:51.640]  just start uploading to two or three other backup sites
[2:41:51.640 --> 2:41:55.560]  other smaller video services people and people are on my message board info
[2:41:55.560 --> 2:41:59.080]  wars dot com prison planet dot com saying why do you care forget youtube and
[2:41:59.080 --> 2:42:02.440]  google well youtube's like number four or five on the
[2:42:02.440 --> 2:42:05.800]  web google's number two on the web yeah there are other
[2:42:05.800 --> 2:42:10.040]  sites getting millions of views a day total but you can get millions of views
[2:42:10.040 --> 2:42:12.520]  per video for your video on youtube and google
[2:42:12.520 --> 2:42:16.200]  that's 90 something percent of the video sharing area
[2:42:16.200 --> 2:42:19.640]  that's where we need to be we don't retreat from the field of battle
[2:42:19.640 --> 2:42:23.240]  enough respect is calling on everyone i mean enough i'd love it if you made
[2:42:23.240 --> 2:42:26.680]  another video including just overall internet censorship and now this is the
[2:42:26.680 --> 2:42:30.120]  front lines this fight at youtube i would love to promote that
[2:42:30.120 --> 2:42:34.120]  push that myself but we're playing in the background the challenge you've got
[2:42:34.120 --> 2:42:39.000]  for december 19th to make your video number one overall
[2:42:39.000 --> 2:42:42.680]  on youtube and then to show people if they do censor
[2:42:42.680 --> 2:42:46.600]  and keep you off the front page as they do my videos and again this is how it
[2:42:46.600 --> 2:42:49.400]  all starts we know that leverman and others in the
[2:42:49.400 --> 2:42:51.800]  congress with the violent radicalization act have said
[2:42:51.800 --> 2:42:55.640]  we want to censor the web we want the government to tell you what to take down
[2:42:55.640 --> 2:42:58.840]  what to put up we see youtube shifting away from
[2:42:58.840 --> 2:43:02.520]  user-made videos that have made it so popular to fluff and corporate videos on
[2:43:02.520 --> 2:43:05.080]  the front page they did that this weekend there was a huge
[2:43:05.080 --> 2:43:09.080]  backlash so they stopped it for the time being but they say on their
[2:43:09.080 --> 2:43:12.200]  their rules page that they're probably going to go back to this so
[2:43:12.200 --> 2:43:15.640]  they let us build youtube and google up then they kick us off of it
[2:43:15.640 --> 2:43:18.840]  and so without further ado we go to john wadkins in cardiff
[2:43:18.840 --> 2:43:23.160]  in the united kingdom and i've never talked to you uh in person
[2:43:23.160 --> 2:43:27.160]  john we appreciate you coming on with us hi alex thanks thanks for having me on
[2:43:27.160 --> 2:43:30.120]  the show it is a real pleasure to be able to speak with you
[2:43:30.120 --> 2:43:33.800]  um i mean yeah you are so right everything you said is just so right
[2:43:33.800 --> 2:43:38.200]  you know this censorship issue is is something that we really can't afford
[2:43:38.200 --> 2:43:41.880]  to ignore because you know it's our free speech we're talking about really
[2:43:41.880 --> 2:43:45.960]  you know and and i noticed this you know the first time i actually noticed this
[2:43:45.960 --> 2:43:49.320]  kind of censorship taking place on the internet was
[2:43:49.320 --> 2:43:53.640]  about two years ago when google started um censoring
[2:43:53.640 --> 2:43:58.600]  movies like parastorm and news change and the censorship was just so
[2:43:58.600 --> 2:44:02.600]  so crude and so so obvious and so sneaky that it was just
[2:44:02.600 --> 2:44:07.000]  infuriating to watch you know i mean for example like as you said
[2:44:07.000 --> 2:44:09.960]  resetting the hit counters you know on certain videos like
[2:44:09.960 --> 2:44:13.960]  parastorm to knock them out of the the top 10 list and
[2:44:13.960 --> 2:44:17.240]  you know when i saw that first of all i thought well maybe it is some kind of
[2:44:17.240 --> 2:44:21.240]  software error but it was happening so often and it was only it only seems to
[2:44:21.240 --> 2:44:26.600]  happen to truth videos and another thing uh i know this was
[2:44:26.600 --> 2:44:30.040]  on google video um they would display the top 10
[2:44:30.040 --> 2:44:34.040]  videos on their home page and now at this time two years ago
[2:44:34.040 --> 2:44:37.080]  i think perastorm and news change were there in the top 10
[2:44:37.080 --> 2:44:40.840]  they displayed every other video that was in the top 10 on their home page except
[2:44:40.840 --> 2:44:43.960]  perastorm and news change and again you know that that
[2:44:43.960 --> 2:44:47.800]  set a few alarm bells ringing you know in my mind
[2:44:47.800 --> 2:44:51.640]  then in february of 2007 a couple of months later
[2:44:51.640 --> 2:44:58.680]  um google pulled the the infamous um bdc video where they reported the
[2:44:58.680 --> 2:45:02.760]  building seven and collapsed um you know 20 minutes before it actually did
[2:45:02.760 --> 2:45:06.600]  collapse and you know every time somebody
[2:45:06.600 --> 2:45:09.880]  tries to upload that video it was pulled within minutes and it
[2:45:09.880 --> 2:45:13.640]  it really was laughable to see you know you could sense the panic
[2:45:13.640 --> 2:45:16.520]  at google they didn't want that video you know
[2:45:16.520 --> 2:45:20.120]  going out there basically um but then when people
[2:45:20.120 --> 2:45:24.040]  you know started to rise up for those tricks what they did then was just to
[2:45:24.040 --> 2:45:27.400]  remove the hit counters completely from all videos so
[2:45:27.400 --> 2:45:30.920]  we couldn't really verify for ourselves which
[2:45:30.920 --> 2:45:34.760]  videos were actually the most popular we just basically have to take google's
[2:45:34.760 --> 2:45:37.240]  words for it and youtube is now moving in that same
[2:45:37.240 --> 2:45:42.520]  direction as is myspace and many others censoring at every level so
[2:45:42.520 --> 2:45:46.440]  it's here it's happening and they shouldn't hold themselves out
[2:45:46.440 --> 2:45:50.920]  as this free open community and then when our videos don't violate any other
[2:45:50.920 --> 2:45:55.000]  rules or terms they go in and specifically target them
[2:45:55.000 --> 2:45:59.640]  for censorship this is false advertising this is fraud
[2:45:59.640 --> 2:46:03.160]  exactly that that's exactly what it is it is fraudulent
[2:46:03.160 --> 2:46:07.640]  you know and it was this censorship that i went two years ago on google that
[2:46:07.640 --> 2:46:11.000]  that made me want to start up a youtube channel and back then
[2:46:11.000 --> 2:46:14.840]  google didn't own youtube and there wasn't that much censorship going on on
[2:46:14.840 --> 2:46:18.120]  youtube at that time it probably was some but it was nothing like
[2:46:18.120 --> 2:46:21.720]  like it is today you know so at that time i thought you know i'll put out some
[2:46:21.720 --> 2:46:24.200]  videos on youtube and hopefully try and get this
[2:46:24.200 --> 2:46:27.560]  information that out there to people you know and
[2:46:27.560 --> 2:46:31.320]  so you know it's thanks to you alex and people like you that you know i've been
[2:46:31.320 --> 2:46:34.760]  able to expand my worldview and when you sort of when you
[2:46:34.760 --> 2:46:38.760]  realize the manipulation that's just taking place you know due to this
[2:46:38.760 --> 2:46:42.360]  globalist elite the first thing you want to do is inform other people and that's
[2:46:42.360 --> 2:46:47.160]  what i'm trying to do on youtube is just to get get you know info out there to
[2:46:47.160 --> 2:46:51.320]  to wake people up and now it's become so difficult and it's own
[2:46:51.320 --> 2:46:57.400]  it only seems to be after google bought youtube that that is when all this
[2:46:57.400 --> 2:47:00.920]  censorship seemed to kick in because it didn't really exist
[2:47:00.920 --> 2:47:05.720]  back you know two years ago but now it's you know it's right on youtube right
[2:47:05.720 --> 2:47:08.840]  now and you know that's because we're going into a
[2:47:08.840 --> 2:47:12.520]  worldwide controlled depression the banks are engineering it they're getting
[2:47:12.520 --> 2:47:15.320]  ready to launch new wars they just tried to start world war three
[2:47:15.320 --> 2:47:18.760]  between pakistan and india as paul watson covered earlier we need you to
[2:47:18.760 --> 2:47:22.840]  make one on that enough uh because uh i mean so much
[2:47:22.840 --> 2:47:25.320]  is i mean you're absolutely right it's all coming to a head
[2:47:25.320 --> 2:47:27.960]  they have a violent radicalization actor trying to pass
[2:47:27.960 --> 2:47:31.960]  they list architects and engineers for 911 truth with al qaeda terrorist
[2:47:31.960 --> 2:47:36.040]  they're getting desperate they're the crooks and then higher ups are saying
[2:47:36.040 --> 2:47:39.000]  shut them down but that's actually great news
[2:47:39.000 --> 2:47:43.560]  because it shows we're having an effect exactly that's right you know and i
[2:47:43.560 --> 2:47:47.080]  think it scares them that we're getting information out there for the
[2:47:47.080 --> 2:47:51.240]  masses and you know i mean on youtube that the methods of
[2:47:51.240 --> 2:47:55.480]  censorship now are just just so blatant you know one method is where
[2:47:55.480 --> 2:47:59.480]  i mean that they remove videos and to be excused that they contain inappropriate
[2:47:59.480 --> 2:48:02.520]  content and this has happened to me a few times about
[2:48:02.520 --> 2:48:06.840]  oh i'll have videos that don't even show in a woman in a short skirt
[2:48:06.840 --> 2:48:11.240]  and they get banned for inappropriate uh or people creating fake alex jones
[2:48:11.240 --> 2:48:14.280]  accounts uh then then they themselves go and
[2:48:14.280 --> 2:48:18.280]  complain on me stuff gets shut down uh there's people in
[2:48:18.280 --> 2:48:21.640]  also editing my videos together where i'm saying racist things but
[2:48:21.640 --> 2:48:24.440]  yeah tell folks about some of the other tactics
[2:48:24.440 --> 2:48:28.920]  well um i just say you know they they remove videos under the pretense that
[2:48:28.920 --> 2:48:33.000]  they contain inappropriate content but youtube doesn't give you any
[2:48:33.000 --> 2:48:36.680]  explanation as to what it is that they seem to be inappropriate for you
[2:48:36.680 --> 2:48:41.000]  you just left in the dark basically and you know
[2:48:41.000 --> 2:48:44.120]  but one thing i noticed with the videos that they removed of mine
[2:48:44.120 --> 2:48:48.040]  under the pretense of you know inappropriate content that they
[2:48:48.040 --> 2:48:51.000]  the one thing they all have in common was that they all chalked up a lot of
[2:48:51.000 --> 2:48:54.760]  views within the first 12 hours i think it's been like 20 000 views within the
[2:48:54.760 --> 2:48:58.440]  first 12 hours and so it seems to me that google
[2:48:58.440 --> 2:49:02.040]  doesn't mind us uploading videos that sort of
[2:49:02.040 --> 2:49:05.960]  expose what's happening with this globalist agenda
[2:49:05.960 --> 2:49:10.280]  but they don't seem to like it when those videos you know gather a lot of views
[2:49:10.280 --> 2:49:13.800]  very quickly because obviously yeah here's an example you made that one
[2:49:13.800 --> 2:49:18.520]  about question your reality you got 200 000 views in one day it was number one
[2:49:18.520 --> 2:49:22.360]  and then suddenly the comments kept going up by the thousands but
[2:49:22.360 --> 2:49:26.200]  suddenly it was frozen for a few days frozen in its
[2:49:26.200 --> 2:49:30.280]  hitch to knock it out of the top that's right that's exactly what i do i
[2:49:30.280 --> 2:49:33.960]  what what they do well what what i noticed with that video was it
[2:49:33.960 --> 2:49:37.400]  generated a huge number of hits then all of a sudden it just sort of
[2:49:37.400 --> 2:49:41.480]  stopped it was like it was weird basically it just didn't look right
[2:49:41.480 --> 2:49:44.760]  you know what one minute it's getting thousands of hits a day and then the
[2:49:44.760 --> 2:49:47.560]  next minute it's just going up by about a hundred or something like that a day
[2:49:47.560 --> 2:49:51.080]  and are you kidding i 200 000 in one day
[2:49:51.080 --> 2:49:54.680]  yeah well this is it i mean i mean that's just one
[2:49:54.680 --> 2:49:58.360]  one example of what's happening on youtube at the moment and it only seems
[2:49:58.360 --> 2:50:01.800]  to happen with truce videos doesn't seem to happen with only
[2:50:01.800 --> 2:50:05.160]  the mainstream sort of stuff you know the britney spears and
[2:50:05.160 --> 2:50:09.400]  and all the rest of it it's only the kind of videos that i upload
[2:50:09.400 --> 2:50:12.360]  and it's not just me that it's happening too it's happening to so many
[2:50:12.360 --> 2:50:15.960]  different channels on youtube and well now obama is announcing internet too
[2:50:15.960 --> 2:50:19.800]  that's what is tens of billions into that is to create the new web
[2:50:19.800 --> 2:50:23.240]  force all of us off as internet too is declared

[2:53:25.080 --> 2:53:29.080]  life most people are overly acidic the fact is that disease simply cannot
[2:53:29.080 --> 2:53:32.920]  exist in an alkaline environment fat accumulates if a person consumes too
[2:53:32.920 --> 2:53:35.800]  much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it

[2:55:17.800 --> 2:55:21.320]  censorship i mean the example of everybody i've had on the day
[2:55:21.320 --> 2:55:24.360]  and you've reached more than anybody in just two years on the web
[2:55:24.360 --> 2:55:27.960]  reaching tens of millions conservatively with just the
[2:55:27.960 --> 2:55:31.160]  you know one or two three videos a month that you make
[2:55:31.160 --> 2:55:35.320]  i salute you and you are the model of the type of person that's going to turn
[2:55:35.320 --> 2:55:39.000]  this world around uh thanks alex i mean that's really nice
[2:55:39.000 --> 2:55:43.080]  for you to say that um yeah i mean it's thanks to you you know if it wasn't for
[2:55:43.080 --> 2:55:46.680]  you there would be no more respect channel on youtube it's because of you
[2:55:46.680 --> 2:55:50.040]  that that i got into doing all this because when when she was as i say when
[2:55:50.040 --> 2:55:53.320]  she realized you know the manipulation that's taking place
[2:55:53.320 --> 2:55:56.680]  you know in this world the one thing you want to do is inform other people and
[2:55:56.680 --> 2:55:58.920]  that's all i'm trying to do on youtube is just
[2:55:58.920 --> 2:56:02.520]  try and wake people up basically you know and and youtube is
[2:56:02.520 --> 2:56:05.640]  thought in my assets every step of the way you know
[2:56:05.640 --> 2:56:09.160]  so many different methods of censorship and they're all really
[2:56:09.160 --> 2:56:13.080]  crude and sneaky and it kind of upsets me because it's not just me
[2:56:13.080 --> 2:56:16.520]  it's happening to it's so many people on youtube we're just trying to do the same
[2:56:16.520 --> 2:56:20.840]  as what i'm doing you know and they make it really hard for us
[2:56:20.840 --> 2:56:24.600]  you know there's just so many different ways that they're doing this now
[2:56:24.600 --> 2:56:28.120]  you know and some are more blatant than others but you know i you know i've seen
[2:56:28.120 --> 2:56:31.800]  it enough times to know you know i mean some things you could just brush off
[2:56:31.800 --> 2:56:36.120]  as that's software error for example but you know some of the things i've seen
[2:56:36.120 --> 2:56:40.760]  you know it is definite censorship there's no other other way to describe it
[2:56:40.760 --> 2:56:44.120]  really i mean another method that they use to
[2:56:44.120 --> 2:56:48.840]  censor people it basically is to suspend people's accounts for no reason at all
[2:56:48.840 --> 2:56:52.120]  and i get i get emails every single day from people
[2:56:52.120 --> 2:56:56.040]  who've had their channel suspended or they for somebody who's had their channel
[2:56:56.040 --> 2:56:59.240]  suspended and when this happens you lose all your
[2:56:59.240 --> 2:57:02.920]  subscribers you lose all your friends all your videos and then when you try and
[2:57:02.920 --> 2:57:06.760]  start up another channel nobody really knows for sure what's right so we need
[2:57:06.760 --> 2:57:09.960]  to create a doppelgangers you need to create when they
[2:57:09.960 --> 2:57:13.480]  used to hack my websites that's why i have so many you just create more and
[2:57:13.480 --> 2:57:16.760]  promote them all and let people know you're under attack and the minute and

[3:00:41.400 --> 3:00:45.560]  uh well it this may not seem like it's connected but i
[3:00:45.560 --> 3:00:49.400]  you know you're talking about the attack on the middle class
[3:00:49.400 --> 3:00:55.480]  i had a event where i became aware curiously of the absolute attack on the
[3:00:55.480 --> 3:00:58.760]  look on the
[3:00:58.760 --> 3:01:03.720]  poor i've been trying to get word to you alex uh but i'm glad bob's here
[3:01:03.720 --> 3:01:06.200]  because i think there's a kind of a connection
[3:01:06.200 --> 3:01:12.200]  i um put up a website called gassing america dot com
[3:01:12.200 --> 3:01:17.960]  and what that's uh exposing is an attack on the very poorest of society what
[3:01:17.960 --> 3:01:21.800]  what what we call the disposables and tell us what's happening
[3:01:21.800 --> 3:01:25.080]  well i had a family contact me with a deathly ill child
[3:01:25.080 --> 3:01:30.120]  i uh diagnosed it investigated beyond the medical profession which seems to be
[3:01:30.120 --> 3:01:34.040]  uh complicit with this they stand you know a lock
[3:01:34.040 --> 3:01:37.160]  okay what's going on we don't have a lot of time tell me
[3:01:37.160 --> 3:01:42.120]  uh the family was being poisoned by carbon monoxide and it's by design
[3:01:42.120 --> 3:01:45.640]  hud has
[3:01:45.640 --> 3:01:49.480]  placed a regulation in place where people living in manufactured
[3:01:49.480 --> 3:01:54.200]  or mobile homes and that's the low end of society or the poorest
[3:01:54.200 --> 3:01:58.280]  uh they are being poisoned by deliberation with fumes coming from
[3:01:58.280 --> 3:02:02.840]  their furnaces and right now i'm in a panic because native americans
[3:02:02.840 --> 3:02:07.000]  vets and everybody poor people blacks the katrina people
[3:02:07.000 --> 3:02:10.360]  are being poisoned because a fresh air opening
[3:02:10.360 --> 3:02:13.400]  is three feet away from the exhaust of the furnace
[3:02:13.400 --> 3:02:16.600]  look on the website i've been trying to get you to look at that alex
[3:02:16.600 --> 3:02:20.200]  but well yeah listen i appreciate your call i'll check it out it's it sounds
[3:02:20.200 --> 3:02:25.560]  interesting so many times regulations that bureaucrats make up so that they're
[3:02:25.560 --> 3:02:29.400]  in charge end up causing serious problems in society i don't know if
[3:02:29.400 --> 3:02:33.000]  they're trying to gas people by design with deadly carbon monoxide but i do
[3:02:33.000 --> 3:02:37.800]  know that 43 percent of native americans were sterilized just in the
[3:02:37.800 --> 3:02:40.840]  70s under george herbert walker bush's program
[3:02:40.840 --> 3:02:44.600]  that he started under richard nixon and that's on record and i know the cbc
[3:02:44.600 --> 3:02:49.000]  reports they are killings indian children uh at these
[3:02:49.000 --> 3:02:52.920]  reservations uh and and at these government homes for them
[3:02:52.920 --> 3:02:55.720]  and they and when they're caught they say well we're supposed to do it you know
[3:02:55.720 --> 3:02:59.320]  this is eugenics uh so yes the look the government is
[3:02:59.320 --> 3:03:03.000]  predatory it's trying to police and military to hate the public it is a
[3:03:03.000 --> 3:03:06.120]  group of criminal predators carrying out criminal
[3:03:06.120 --> 3:03:09.400]  activities against us bob jevin
[3:03:09.400 --> 3:03:13.320]  i agree completely and uh it's getting worse and worse
[3:03:13.320 --> 3:03:17.720]  each and every day uh it's just yesterday i saw
[3:03:17.720 --> 3:03:24.360]  a picture in the uh the arizona republic of uh military people
[3:03:24.360 --> 3:03:29.480]  uh full gear and weaponry uh working with police
[3:03:29.480 --> 3:03:32.840]  simile units and so you're absolutely right it's just an
[3:03:32.840 --> 3:03:37.000]  ongoing enlargening thing well it's worse than that the
[3:03:37.000 --> 3:03:41.000]  the arizona operation includes troops from eight other nations they have
[3:03:41.000 --> 3:03:45.480]  foreign troops and it's in major newspapers that they will use foreign
[3:03:45.480 --> 3:03:48.680]  troops against the american people and they're hiring foreigners for the
[3:03:48.680 --> 3:03:52.840]  military private mercenaries and aggravated felons you cannot
[3:03:52.840 --> 3:03:57.080]  make up tyranny that bad i mean it looks like they're trying to just do the
[3:03:57.080 --> 3:04:03.000]  most evil takeover in history bob it certainly is
[3:04:03.000 --> 3:04:06.440]  again a pack of psychopathic criminals are in control the international

[3:10:22.680 --> 3:10:26.120]  that clearly building seven and tower one and two
[3:10:26.120 --> 3:10:30.840]  on 9 11 were controlled demolitions and now
[3:10:30.840 --> 3:10:34.200]  mr gage and many others have been vindicated because nist
[3:10:34.200 --> 3:10:38.600]  latest report has had to admit that there was
[3:10:38.600 --> 3:10:42.680]  freefall involved they denied that in building seven freefall falling at the
[3:10:42.680 --> 3:10:45.880]  speed of gravity as richard has always said they tried to spend it and claim
[3:10:45.880 --> 3:10:49.160]  14 seconds now they've had to cut that in half
[3:10:49.160 --> 3:10:53.240]  and they're admitting that it did fall at freefall speeds
[3:10:53.240 --> 3:10:57.960]  and so again these scientific questions are making a lot of scholarly
[3:10:57.960 --> 3:11:00.520]  individuals with a lot of letters but behind their name
[3:11:00.520 --> 3:11:04.040]  look at the raw data architects and engineers and scholars around 11 truth
[3:11:04.040 --> 3:11:10.600]  and many others have gotten published reports in peer-reviewed journals
[3:11:10.600 --> 3:11:13.800]  detailing their findings and some of the most prestigious peer-reviewed
[3:11:13.800 --> 3:11:16.760]  journals out there have found their findings to be
[3:11:16.760 --> 3:11:21.640]  conclusive and he's fresh back from a tour of europe to
[3:11:21.640 --> 3:11:24.840]  crowds of hundreds and in some cases thousands of people
[3:11:24.840 --> 3:11:28.600]  he's also spoken in new jersey in new york you know brought into town by
[3:11:28.600 --> 3:11:32.280]  by police officers and others to talk to folks and he's gone through
[3:11:32.280 --> 3:11:36.360]  a lot of attacks to bring you this information so
[3:11:36.360 --> 3:11:40.120]  i want to salute richard gauge for all his fine work and
[3:11:40.120 --> 3:11:43.880]  commend him another example of what a highly motivated focus professional
[3:11:43.880 --> 3:11:47.560]  person can do in the defense of not just this republic
[3:11:47.560 --> 3:11:51.240]  but in the defense of those that were murdered on 9 11 and now the millions
[3:11:51.240 --> 3:11:55.560]  that have died around the world in the war on terror the million plus irakis
[3:11:55.560 --> 3:12:01.000]  that have died in the name of that lie and false flag is now a household term
[3:12:01.000 --> 3:12:05.800]  self-inflicted wound is now part of the nomenclature
[3:12:05.800 --> 3:12:08.360]  and now it comes out in major publications the chain he wanted to
[3:12:08.360 --> 3:12:12.440]  stage terror attacks on us ships just six months ago as a pretext to attack
[3:12:12.440 --> 3:12:15.000]  iran thank god the military got the word out and
[3:12:15.000 --> 3:12:18.760]  stop that we now know that's why admiral fowlin resigned
[3:12:18.760 --> 3:12:24.040]  he was not going to be part of attacking us ships with fake iranian patrol boats
[3:12:24.040 --> 3:12:28.440]  so a lot is happening and the truth is coming out in international television
[3:12:28.440 --> 3:12:33.160]  in england in germany in japan in russia in the middle east
[3:12:33.160 --> 3:12:39.000]  are in in in um just all over the world are airing well produced shows showing
[3:12:39.000 --> 3:12:42.760]  the evidence that 9 11 wasn't inside job so
[3:12:42.760 --> 3:12:45.800]  we are winning this fight and one of the frontline warriors one of the most
[3:12:45.800 --> 3:12:49.160]  successful at getting the truth out has been richard gauge so richard good to
[3:12:49.160 --> 3:12:53.320]  have you with us thank you alex it's just great to be with you again
[3:12:53.320 --> 3:12:57.000]  i can't tell you i'm really excited well we've gone over
[3:12:57.000 --> 3:13:00.840]  the the evidence of control demolition in all three of the towers and not just
[3:13:00.840 --> 3:13:03.240]  the eyewitnesses but the scientific evidence but
[3:13:03.240 --> 3:13:07.880]  uh... can you recap the last six months since you were on with us
[3:13:07.880 --> 3:13:13.000]  what has happened with nist nist having to go back on their previous reports
[3:13:13.000 --> 3:13:17.240]  and where the scientific investigation is right now
[3:13:17.240 --> 3:13:22.840]  yes well nist came out with their uh... re draft report of world trade center
[3:13:22.840 --> 3:13:26.200]  seven the third uh... high rise that came down
[3:13:26.200 --> 3:13:29.880]  uh... not hit by an airplane uh... came down in the afternoon
[3:13:29.880 --> 3:13:34.600]  uh... about five twenty nine eleven uh... and we'll talk about how it came
[3:13:34.600 --> 3:13:39.720]  down but seven years later finally we have a draft report in august
[3:13:39.720 --> 3:13:44.760]  uh... in which they've got they try to document that it was forty percent of
[3:13:44.760 --> 3:13:47.960]  gravity that uh... the building came down
[3:13:47.960 --> 3:13:53.160]  now uh... the upon questions by physicist david chenler and
[3:13:53.160 --> 3:13:58.520]  scientist doctor steven jones they publicly had to backtrack and fumble
[3:13:58.520 --> 3:14:01.400]  their way through the the the conference
[3:14:01.400 --> 3:14:06.280]  and in their final report which just came out uh... in november last month
[3:14:06.280 --> 3:14:10.200]  they acknowledge that in the first two and a quarter
[3:14:10.200 --> 3:14:13.320]  second this forty seven story building
[3:14:13.320 --> 3:14:18.920]  uh... drops at freefall speed which is eight stories
[3:14:18.920 --> 3:14:25.960]  now prior to this in in august they said publicly that
[3:14:25.960 --> 3:14:29.640]  it could not fall in freefall speed because had it that would mean the
[3:14:29.640 --> 3:14:32.680]  structure would have there would have been no structure
[3:14:32.680 --> 3:14:36.200]  and so now they're acknowledging freefall speed but they're not saying
[3:14:36.200 --> 3:14:38.840]  well there must not have been structure there
[3:14:38.840 --> 3:14:43.080]  in other words uh... what they're basically acknowledging uh... to
[3:14:43.080 --> 3:14:46.840]  the nine eleven truth movement in the world is that uh...
[3:14:46.840 --> 3:14:51.880]  the structure had to have been removed for those eight stories
[3:14:51.880 --> 3:14:55.560]  because a building cannot fall at freefall speed
[3:14:55.560 --> 3:14:59.160]  and convert all of its gravitational potential energy
[3:14:59.160 --> 3:15:03.000]  to kinetic energy and do any other work
[3:15:03.000 --> 3:15:06.280]  it can't crush the forty thousand tons of steel
[3:15:06.280 --> 3:15:10.440]  that was in the building that was designed to resist any type of collapse
[3:15:10.440 --> 3:15:16.760]  and again this was the fema command bunker overbuilt for strength cia fbi
[3:15:16.760 --> 3:15:20.680]  defense intelligence more than twenty secretive federal agencies
[3:15:20.680 --> 3:15:25.160]  base there uh... their largest uh... section offices
[3:15:25.160 --> 3:15:28.520]  outside of virginia and maryland in the world
[3:15:28.520 --> 3:15:33.400]  well that was on the twenty third floor yes it was a very highly secure uh...
[3:15:33.400 --> 3:15:36.280]  uh... bunker would complete with uh... uh...
[3:15:36.280 --> 3:15:39.640]  the all that they needed in the way of electricity water and
[3:15:39.640 --> 3:15:45.400]  and so back up electricity uh... reinforced windows against all kinds of
[3:15:45.400 --> 3:15:48.520]  hurricane and so forth but all of this was abandoned
[3:15:48.520 --> 3:15:54.840]  on the uh... morning of nine eleven for try to do a terror attack drill
[3:15:54.840 --> 3:15:59.080]  they had already moved out they had already moved out the night before most
[3:15:59.080 --> 3:16:02.520]  of their operations out of the pier as fema said
[3:16:02.520 --> 3:16:06.280]  because they were doing a top-off to drill uh...
[3:16:06.280 --> 3:16:10.760]  tripod to drill for a terror attack yes we understand that uh... there were
[3:16:10.760 --> 3:16:13.880]  hundreds of fema employees the day before nine eleven
[3:16:13.880 --> 3:16:18.040]  in preparation for a mock biochemical attack in downtown
[3:16:18.040 --> 3:16:22.440]  manhattan and we are wondering if that is just a coincidence or not
[3:16:22.440 --> 3:16:25.960]  but uh... the five hundred and fifty architects and engineers who are
[3:16:25.960 --> 3:16:28.120]  demanding a real investigation
[3:16:28.120 --> 3:16:31.560]  uh... do try to stick with the technical evidence that
[3:16:31.560 --> 3:16:36.120]  we're not conspiracy theorists so we really do want uh... yeah others to
[3:16:36.120 --> 3:16:39.320]  investigate these matters and we're glad that uh... you're one of them
[3:16:39.320 --> 3:16:43.080]  let's talk about that matter next of the five hundred and fifty and now a year
[3:16:43.080 --> 3:16:46.200]  and a half joining your group and then it was growing exponentially
[3:16:46.200 --> 3:16:50.360]  but before we go there i'm not an architect i'm not an engineer
[3:16:50.360 --> 3:16:52.920]  uh... but you know this is the main show that brought out the building seven
[3:16:52.920 --> 3:16:55.400]  controversy day one i remember hearing the news
[3:16:55.400 --> 3:16:58.040]  as i was driving in my car back to the studio saying they're going to bring
[3:16:58.040 --> 3:17:01.000]  building seven down the solomon brothers they're going to
[3:17:01.000 --> 3:17:03.960]  have a controlled demolition so it doesn't damage other buildings
[3:17:03.960 --> 3:17:07.880]  uh... other people remember those reports the false reports bbc
[3:17:07.880 --> 3:17:11.480]  fox cnn reporting it had fallen before it fell
[3:17:11.480 --> 3:17:15.800]  but i wanted to be specific here uh... you know watching what what nista said
[3:17:15.800 --> 3:17:18.840]  first they said free falls impossible because that would have to be explosives
[3:17:18.840 --> 3:17:22.360]  only explosives can you know do that because as it falls it takes time to
[3:17:22.360 --> 3:17:25.960]  crush you know the next level and you know the basic science
[3:17:25.960 --> 3:17:30.520]  uh... shows that uh... but we have footage now of the entire building falling
[3:17:30.520 --> 3:17:34.440]  they love to show a video from you know a mile away with a building in the way
[3:17:34.440 --> 3:17:38.040]  we only see the first you know twenty five stories or so because the other
[3:17:38.040 --> 3:17:41.560]  twenty something stories are below uh... the field of view but in the other
[3:17:41.560 --> 3:17:46.760]  videos we've timed it and uh... you know it is falling uh... in a
[3:17:46.760 --> 3:17:50.840]  little more than six seconds i mean you can take your watch you can time it
[3:17:50.840 --> 3:17:55.480]  and you know that's how fast it falls so even this now backing off and saying
[3:17:55.480 --> 3:17:57.800]  okay for a few seconds it was a free fall
[3:17:57.800 --> 3:18:02.040]  it looks as if that is another deception
[3:18:02.040 --> 3:18:05.400]  well i don't follow you they they acknowledge the free fall
[3:18:05.400 --> 3:18:09.000]  uh... but they they are certainly are being deceptive about the implications
[3:18:09.000 --> 3:18:12.040]  of that because not just that they're saying that the free fall was only
[3:18:12.040 --> 3:18:16.360]  partial but when i watch the videos it's a continual free fall not just of age
[3:18:16.360 --> 3:18:18.360]  stories but forty seven oh
[3:18:18.360 --> 3:18:23.160]  oh yeah no it actually does slow down i encourage your listeners to uh... look
[3:18:23.160 --> 3:18:27.160]  at the ten minute video by that says it's piling up at the bottom
[3:18:27.160 --> 3:18:30.920]  yeah it begins to slow down after about two and a half seconds just
[3:18:30.920 --> 3:18:34.600]  slightly it is almost free fall for the next uh...
[3:18:34.600 --> 3:18:38.360]  two three seconds and then it slows down a little bit more so
[3:18:38.360 --> 3:18:42.600]  it is very close to to to free fall all the way you would expect that as it
[3:18:42.600 --> 3:18:46.280]  actually did meet resistance they blow the four floors out it falls in on the
[3:18:46.280 --> 3:18:49.240]  rubble and then you finally do have some slowing
[3:18:49.240 --> 3:18:52.680]  yes they're counting on the way to the building to be harnessed to do most of
[3:18:52.680 --> 3:18:56.360]  the destruction so uh... we we have witnesses who have
[3:18:56.360 --> 3:19:00.520]  heard explosions at the base of the building presumably those uh...
[3:19:00.520 --> 3:19:04.760]  lower eight floors we don't really know a real investigation would get at the
[3:19:04.760 --> 3:19:07.800]  heart of this and also to how they might have planted
[3:19:07.800 --> 3:19:12.280]  uh... such explosives but we do know that the lobby they had access to the lobby
[3:19:12.280 --> 3:19:16.760]  uh... they which is not occupied they had access to the fifth and sixth floor
[3:19:16.760 --> 3:19:19.880]  which is mechanical floors uh... complete access
[3:19:19.880 --> 3:19:23.240]  and through uh... the elevator shaft they could have had access to
[3:19:23.240 --> 3:19:26.920]  the entire core structure of the building without being detected by
[3:19:26.920 --> 3:19:30.120]  it was a spook facility well we're going to break and come back and then i'm
[3:19:30.120 --> 3:19:32.280]  going to attempt to give you the floor there's just so many issues i want to
[3:19:32.280 --> 3:19:35.240]  bring up here with richard gauge the founder of architects and engineers
[3:19:35.240 --> 3:19:39.480]  nine eleven truth over five hundred members now and growing of structural
[3:19:39.480 --> 3:19:43.160]  engineers and architects very very powerful group
[3:19:43.160 --> 3:19:46.280]  of uh... of of accredited men and women
[3:19:46.280 --> 3:19:49.960]  that cannot be ignored and we'll talk about the deceptions in the news
[3:19:49.960 --> 3:19:53.400]  reports and uh... why they've been so deceptive and why
[3:19:53.400 --> 3:19:56.920]  they claim there was no molten metal when the government's own
[3:19:56.920 --> 3:20:00.280]  uh... studies and their own photographs admit there was molten metal
[3:20:00.280 --> 3:20:04.440]  stay with us everyone knows that omega three should be an essential part of

[3:21:04.520 --> 3:21:07.640]  reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending
[3:21:07.640 --> 3:21:11.480]  therefore with catastrophic events it comes as no surprise that some banks
[3:21:11.480 --> 3:21:14.680]  have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove
[3:21:14.680 --> 3:21:17.320]  from their accounts a fractional reserve system means
[3:21:17.320 --> 3:21:21.240]  only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal
[3:21:21.240 --> 3:21:24.840]  deficit spending will skyrocket through fdic if the government is forced to
[3:21:24.840 --> 3:21:28.440]  ensure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy
[3:21:28.440 --> 3:21:32.200]  a current effort is underway by the fed along with other central banks to
[3:21:32.200 --> 3:21:35.800]  increase liquidity for depositors however an increase in money supply
[3:21:35.800 --> 3:21:39.160]  without equal expansion and productivity can cause inflation
[3:21:39.160 --> 3:21:43.240]  in order to achieve strength and stability i recommend a conservative portion
[3:21:43.240 --> 3:21:47.080]  of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver
[3:21:47.080 --> 3:21:50.280]  while paper investments currently have been driven by debt
[3:21:50.280 --> 3:21:53.640]  gold on its own has held value for over six thousand years

[3:24:09.000 --> 3:24:13.000]  with nist and their deceptions for those that don't know who nist is you might
[3:24:13.000 --> 3:24:15.960]  want to tell them who they are and then i want you to spend some more time on
[3:24:15.960 --> 3:24:18.280]  the explosive growth and the published papers
[3:24:18.280 --> 3:24:22.840]  peer reviewed by architects and engineers for 9-11 truth
[3:24:22.840 --> 3:24:28.520]  yes we have uh nist so acknowledging uh freefall we were asking all of your
[3:24:28.520 --> 3:24:32.760]  listeners to write letters uh to the national institute of standards and
[3:24:32.760 --> 3:24:37.080]  technology and mostly to uh government officials and
[3:24:37.080 --> 3:24:41.960]  media officials uh highlighting the dichotomy of of what they're
[3:24:41.960 --> 3:24:45.800]  saying on the one hand and what they're not saying on the other
[3:24:45.800 --> 3:24:50.920]  uh that that this could only have been uh by explosive control demolition
[3:24:50.920 --> 3:24:55.640]  uh it's it's it's critical that we get a real investigation and we're asking
[3:24:55.640 --> 3:25:00.760]  also all of your listeners to uh email every architect and engineer they
[3:25:00.760 --> 3:25:05.800]  can find and with the link to the the video that
[3:25:05.800 --> 3:25:09.080]  documents uh this deception on the part of nist
[3:25:09.080 --> 3:25:12.600]  and the link the video can be found on youtube
[3:25:12.600 --> 3:25:18.840]  at our account which is a e 9-1-1 truth uh so go to youtube
[3:25:18.840 --> 3:25:24.120]  and uh look for a e 9-1-1 truth you'll see a listing of our videos the most
[3:25:24.120 --> 3:25:27.480]  prominent one that's received 20 000 hits is this
[3:25:27.480 --> 3:25:33.000]  uh physics professor uh david chandler who and in this 10 minute video
[3:25:33.000 --> 3:25:37.240]  documents this it's it's really important and by the way this this is our
[3:25:37.240 --> 3:25:42.200]  international boycott youtube day today uh because they've been censoring a
[3:25:42.200 --> 3:25:45.800]  lot of people but on this day i would encourage our listeners
[3:25:45.800 --> 3:25:49.960]  to go get the video you've posted there and posted on blip tv
[3:25:49.960 --> 3:25:53.800]  live link and a bunch of others we're trying to get folks to have an exodus
[3:25:53.800 --> 3:25:57.000]  away from youtube we're going to stay on youtube and keep fighting them but to
[3:25:57.000 --> 3:26:00.680]  prepare people to try to build up some other big mega sites
[3:26:00.680 --> 3:26:05.560]  because of the censorship of youtube openly announcing they are now run by
[3:26:05.560 --> 3:26:09.240]  the adl when they decide what goes up and what doesn't they've been
[3:26:09.240 --> 3:26:12.360]  banning my videos restricting them doing a lot of other bad things and banning a
[3:26:12.360 --> 3:26:16.040]  lot of 9-11 truth videos but a side issue the boycott of youtube is going
[3:26:16.040 --> 3:26:19.240]  on today that's why my channel is shut down right now
[3:26:19.240 --> 3:26:22.920]  but please continue with uh with some of the deception
[3:26:22.920 --> 3:26:26.440]  that they're involved in that you guys are exposing well you brought up
[3:26:26.440 --> 3:26:30.440]  molten metal as well and this is one of the critical pieces of
[3:26:30.440 --> 3:26:36.760]  of evidence that is denied by nist in fact before nists took over the
[3:26:36.760 --> 3:26:41.240]  investigation a fema had done their own investigation
[3:26:41.240 --> 3:26:45.080]  and interestingly enough uh their conclusion first of all
[3:26:45.080 --> 3:26:49.640]  is that um fryer which is their best hypothesis of how this building
[3:26:49.640 --> 3:26:54.440]  came down has a very low probability of occurrence
[3:26:54.440 --> 3:26:58.920]  uh what do you do when your your your best hypothesis has a low probability
[3:26:58.920 --> 3:27:02.200]  of occurrence you look for another hypothesis
[3:27:02.200 --> 3:27:06.600]  in fact they found some evidence and documented it very well
[3:27:06.600 --> 3:27:12.200]  for uh the explosive control demolition with a new type of
[3:27:12.200 --> 3:27:17.000]  of material an incendiary called thermite
[3:27:17.000 --> 3:27:20.920]  this stuff has there's evidence all throughout the world trade center
[3:27:20.920 --> 3:27:24.680]  of thermite in fact uh there there there is
[3:27:24.680 --> 3:27:29.960]  several tons of molten metal found uh by the first responders
[3:27:29.960 --> 3:27:33.240]  found by the world trade center structural engine
[3:27:33.240 --> 3:27:37.320]  Leslie robertson and associates of his and other structural engineers
[3:27:37.320 --> 3:27:41.960]  document the melting of steel and how do you get all this molten steel
[3:27:41.960 --> 3:27:45.800]  when we're talking about thousands of degrees above
[3:27:45.800 --> 3:27:48.600]  what we know is going on i mean the people are standing in the wounds in the
[3:27:48.600 --> 3:27:52.520]  buildings waving their arms it's not melting them how does it melt
[3:27:52.520 --> 3:27:56.760]  these big four foot around girders then we have the video of the molten steel
[3:27:56.760 --> 3:27:59.720]  you know the proper coloration the studies have been done
[3:27:59.720 --> 3:28:03.720]  pouring out founting out like a foundry we had the firefighters
[3:28:03.720 --> 3:28:08.360]  on tv saying it was just like a foundry like inside a volcano just
[3:28:08.360 --> 3:28:12.920]  molten metal uh everywhere and then for weeks we have this molten metal
[3:28:12.920 --> 3:28:17.800]  yeah absolutely and fema documents the melting of the steel the hot sulfur
[3:28:17.800 --> 3:28:22.120]  corrosion attack turning three-quarter inch girders into swiss cheese
[3:28:22.120 --> 3:28:25.720]  this is documented by arbol hazon astani the structural engineer
[3:28:25.720 --> 3:28:30.600]  who had unlimited access out there where does all of this melted steel come
[3:28:30.600 --> 3:28:34.600]  from and more even more importantly what did nist do with this
[3:28:34.600 --> 3:28:40.440]  documentation in appendix c of the final fema report in may of 2002
[3:28:40.440 --> 3:28:43.720]  they ejected it is not a part of the official record
[3:28:43.720 --> 3:28:47.880]  they cannot afford to acknowledge this molten metal in fact their lead
[3:28:47.880 --> 3:28:51.400]  structural engineer john gross denies that there's any evidence
[3:28:51.400 --> 3:28:55.800]  or witnesses of molten metal he denies this publicly when there's dozens of
[3:28:55.800 --> 3:28:59.080]  witnesses and plenty of photographic evidence as you cited
[3:28:59.080 --> 3:29:02.920]  flowing out of the that's right south tower near the jet plane impact the
[3:29:02.920 --> 3:29:07.240]  local student group peanut a project for a new american citizen
[3:29:07.240 --> 3:29:11.480]  uh they got a few years ago questioned him about that and he said there is no
[3:29:11.480 --> 3:29:14.520]  molten metal it didn't matter if they had the video there we're trying to show
[3:29:14.520 --> 3:29:17.800]  him uh and now there's all this footage of molten
[3:29:17.800 --> 3:29:22.600]  metal but still they're in denial about it they're going to have to at some
[3:29:22.600 --> 3:29:25.720]  point acknowledge that it exists and come up with some excuse
[3:29:25.720 --> 3:29:30.200]  what we've heard so far is oh well they the fire was down in the degree and it
[3:29:30.200 --> 3:29:33.880]  was so insulated that it got hotter and hotter and hotter
[3:29:33.880 --> 3:29:38.040]  which is physically impossible and that's not how it works things cool in
[3:29:38.040 --> 3:29:41.080]  entropy all right uh we'll be right back with richard

[3:30:06.360 --> 3:30:09.800]  that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers
[3:30:09.800 --> 3:30:13.240]  than when drinking the water that's because many chemicals are inhaled
[3:30:13.240 --> 3:30:16.280]  when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin

[3:34:02.360 --> 3:34:05.960]  you know showing with her evidence that's an inside job and then how they
[3:34:05.960 --> 3:34:10.600]  persecuted her when she started asking questions uh it seems that 9 11 truth
[3:34:10.600 --> 3:34:14.760]  is only growing and growing and growing uh richard gaige
[3:34:14.760 --> 3:34:18.920]  it's growing by millions uh every year as a matter of fact
[3:34:18.920 --> 3:34:23.880]  we we had as you mentioned the europeans brought us out we had national
[3:34:23.880 --> 3:34:29.240]  coverage in in madrid and it's it we were to sell out crowds and in half
[3:34:29.240 --> 3:34:33.880]  of the the european cities uh they're they're
[3:34:33.880 --> 3:34:37.880]  more awake over there and the media is less controlled in
[3:34:37.880 --> 3:34:41.560]  many of the areas of europe not all by any means
[3:34:41.560 --> 3:34:46.040]  we have uh we expect to have a thousand architects and engineers signed on
[3:34:46.040 --> 3:34:49.880]  demanding a real investigation by uh late summer
[3:34:49.880 --> 3:34:53.880]  and we will take the petition to washington dc
[3:34:53.880 --> 3:34:58.040]  hold and take a lot of members of the 9 11 truth movement with us
[3:34:58.040 --> 3:35:01.080]  hold the press conference at the national press club
[3:35:01.080 --> 3:35:05.400]  and present the petition to congress uh so
[3:35:05.400 --> 3:35:09.800]  we we hope to also have hundreds of our architects and engineers there with us
[3:35:09.800 --> 3:35:15.480]  so that's a big push for us there's a large
[3:35:15.480 --> 3:35:19.640]  conference for 9 11 happening in australia also in november
[3:35:19.640 --> 3:35:25.720]  and a very important uh conference in denver uh
[3:35:25.720 --> 3:35:28.520]  american transparency you must know about that one
[3:35:28.520 --> 3:35:32.280]  uh coming up in february so there's there's a lot
[3:35:32.280 --> 3:35:35.880]  going on a lot happening i wanted to make sure
[3:35:35.880 --> 3:35:39.960]  i realized i left some of your listeners hanging relative to this molten
[3:35:39.960 --> 3:35:43.400]  metal because some people say well who cares what what does that mean well
[3:35:43.400 --> 3:35:48.200]  it turns out that this is not melted steel it turns out that it's not
[3:35:48.200 --> 3:35:53.640]  aluminum from a jet airplane uh it's molten iron it's iron this stuff is
[3:35:53.640 --> 3:35:57.000]  brought up in iron while a component of structural steel
[3:35:57.000 --> 3:36:02.280]  is this is not uh that this is the byproduct of thermite
[3:36:02.280 --> 3:36:05.880]  this is uh pure iron with elements of aluminum
[3:36:05.880 --> 3:36:11.720]  sulfur manganese fluorine and even one three di phenyl propane interesting
[3:36:11.720 --> 3:36:15.960]  is found the eric schwarz of the epa says they've never found that before
[3:36:15.960 --> 3:36:20.200]  all of this is the key signature chemical signature
[3:36:20.200 --> 3:36:23.880]  of thermite a high-tech incendiary which is used
[3:36:23.880 --> 3:36:27.640]  by the military to cut through steel like a hot knife through butter
[3:36:27.640 --> 3:36:32.040]  and not just thermite but thermite the specific type they don't just find the
[3:36:32.040 --> 3:36:35.320]  thermate residue they're finding the thermite residue
[3:36:35.320 --> 3:36:39.160]  and it's not just a thermite or a thermite residue either it is a very high
[3:36:39.160 --> 3:36:43.720]  tech form of thermite thermate with nano sized particles
[3:36:43.720 --> 3:36:49.080]  found in unignited chips uh red on one side gray on the other in all of the
[3:36:49.080 --> 3:36:52.040]  dust samples so we're even finding uh part of the
[3:36:52.040 --> 3:36:56.280]  unignited explosive of the thermate and then it turns out some of the people
[3:36:56.280 --> 3:37:00.200]  at nist just so happened to be former nasa experts in
[3:37:00.200 --> 3:37:05.480]  thermate couplers explosive bolts for separating intercontinental ballistic
[3:37:05.480 --> 3:37:10.520]  missiles and large booster components in their second and third stages
[3:37:10.520 --> 3:37:14.040]  just so happens that there's of just a few experts in the world
[3:37:14.040 --> 3:37:18.920]  on thermate uh they just so happen to be the people
[3:37:18.920 --> 3:37:23.720]  over at nist that's interesting it's very interesting and you can read more
[3:37:23.720 --> 3:37:26.760]  about that on our website on the technical articles
[3:37:26.760 --> 3:37:31.000]  kevin ryan has done some incredible work our website is
[3:37:31.000 --> 3:37:39.880]  a e 911truth.org and people can also purchase the dvd to get more
[3:37:39.880 --> 3:37:44.840]  information we have a two-hour dvd on all of this evidence it's all laid out
[3:37:44.840 --> 3:37:50.360]  for you absolutely tell folks they can get that there at the site
[3:37:50.360 --> 3:37:55.160]  yeah right on the left side of the website a e 911truth.org
[3:37:55.160 --> 3:37:59.080]  the evidence is uh listed for you on the right side
[3:37:59.080 --> 3:38:03.880]  there's uh plenty of very important articles the powerpoint presentation
[3:38:03.880 --> 3:38:07.880]  that i have used in 80 different presentations
[3:38:07.880 --> 3:38:11.320]  around the country and in europe and canada uh is
[3:38:11.320 --> 3:38:15.960]  is there you can step through like 500 slides uh very carefully read all the
[3:38:15.960 --> 3:38:20.280]  information what is the establishment uh trying to
[3:38:20.280 --> 3:38:23.240]  do to stop you or discredit you i know that
[3:38:23.240 --> 3:38:27.000]  uh mythbusters is doing a two-hour special national geographic
[3:38:27.000 --> 3:38:30.600]  uh is uh doing a special they wanted me to be part of it but it's a guy that
[3:38:30.600 --> 3:38:34.040]  does hit pieces on patriot groups and on jfk
[3:38:34.040 --> 3:38:37.880]  researchers and so there's no point being interviewed so he can edit it
[3:38:37.880 --> 3:38:41.960]  all together i believe you were interviewed by these guys though
[3:38:41.960 --> 3:38:45.560]  so so there's a whole group uh and that's just two of the shows there's
[3:38:45.560 --> 3:38:50.520]  several other big shows being produced trying to counter us right now
[3:38:50.520 --> 3:38:55.400]  yes and i'm not so sure that uh the gentleman that interviewed me for the
[3:38:55.400 --> 3:39:00.040]  national geographic uh two-hour tv 9-11 documentary
[3:39:00.040 --> 3:39:05.320]  is uh uh producing a hit piece uh on this particular subject
[3:39:05.320 --> 3:39:09.800]  he has uh he seems fairly well convinced to me and gave us
[3:39:09.800 --> 3:39:13.160]  every benefit of the doubt and asked us if there's a very friendly interview i
[3:39:13.160 --> 3:39:16.440]  was surprised have you seen the films he's made
[3:39:16.440 --> 3:39:22.600]  no get ready okay time and time again people say oh the bbc was so nice and i
[3:39:22.600 --> 3:39:26.200]  go no i've seen i go look at what they've made in the past he is a
[3:39:26.200 --> 3:39:30.360]  specialist in going after uh alternative media
[3:39:30.360 --> 3:39:35.640]  and uh i did a whole show about their lat his inside the uh
[3:39:35.640 --> 3:39:40.440]  you know a limo special that aired on a discovery channel a few weeks ago
[3:39:40.440 --> 3:39:47.160]  and just the whole thing is a uh misrepresentation and then i interviewed
[3:39:47.160 --> 3:39:51.400]  uh robert groden who was the expert i want to lead the experts in the world
[3:39:51.400 --> 3:39:55.320]  but helped make the film jfk was the main consultant on that
[3:39:55.320 --> 3:39:58.840]  technical consultant to oliver stone and he was there when they were in dalas
[3:39:58.840 --> 3:40:02.360]  with the car doing their shots he said but that's not where the shooter was
[3:40:02.360 --> 3:40:06.440]  he was here but wait i mean i mean he just goes on and on
[3:40:06.440 --> 3:40:12.280]  uh so uh well just get ready my friend look we'll cross our fingers and hope
[3:40:12.280 --> 3:40:16.520]  for the best i guess huh absolutely we will do that uh
[3:40:16.520 --> 3:40:19.000]  incidentally for some reason my computer's gone dead that had the
[3:40:19.000 --> 3:40:23.240]  collars on it so uh we'll uh the network i am that to the
[3:40:23.240 --> 3:40:25.720]  guys and will you guys bring me a sheet with those collars on it because i want
[3:40:25.720 --> 3:40:29.640]  to go to those here in just the next few minutes
[3:40:29.640 --> 3:40:33.960]  um richard there's so many other facets
[3:40:33.960 --> 3:40:38.680]  to this uh other points in your research that you haven't made that we need to go
[3:40:38.680 --> 3:40:42.920]  over and then secondarily uh second i would like you to speak about the
[3:40:42.920 --> 3:40:49.400]  explosive growth of your organization oh you bet um well relative to building
[3:40:49.400 --> 3:40:53.960]  seven let's let's complete this because it's not just the fact that we have
[3:40:53.960 --> 3:40:58.760]  freefall which one it is it's only one of the many smoking guns this building
[3:40:58.760 --> 3:41:03.160]  47 stories high uh begins immediately its
[3:41:03.160 --> 3:41:06.680]  descent and it falls symmetrically and smoothly nearly
[3:41:06.680 --> 3:41:09.960]  straight down and almost into its own footprint
[3:41:09.960 --> 3:41:13.560]  this is a feat that only a handful of companies in the world can can even
[3:41:13.560 --> 3:41:17.640]  accomplish and it is in itself uh proof of control
[3:41:17.640 --> 3:41:20.760]  demolition because you in order to bring a building straight down
[3:41:20.760 --> 3:41:24.680]  you have to take out in this case the 23 core columns
[3:41:24.680 --> 3:41:29.240]  within a tenth of a second of each other uh synchronistically time floor by
[3:41:29.240 --> 3:41:32.200]  floor that's the only way you can get it to come down
[3:41:32.200 --> 3:41:37.000]  straight so that is a second uh smoking gun if you will
[3:41:37.000 --> 3:41:41.560]  indeed also we have uh throughout uh all the whole ground zero all of this
[3:41:41.560 --> 3:41:45.000]  dust that blanket at lower manhattan has these tiny
[3:41:45.000 --> 3:41:49.320]  iron-rich microspheres smaller than a human hair most of them
[3:41:49.320 --> 3:41:52.920]  this could only have come from an aluminum thermic event
[3:41:52.920 --> 3:41:56.120]  because they have the chemical ingredients once again of ignited
[3:41:56.120 --> 3:41:59.720]  thermite so uh there there there's no way that
[3:41:59.720 --> 3:42:03.720]  these this all of this dust 20 minutes away in the brooklyn bridge
[3:42:03.720 --> 3:42:07.240]  up on top of the skyscrapers uh two three blocks away
[3:42:07.240 --> 3:42:12.440]  and filling all of the apartments could have uh these billions of these uh
[3:42:12.440 --> 3:42:15.880]  spheres well how do they get to be spheres well in
[3:42:15.880 --> 3:42:19.880]  liquid does this it surface tension forms itself into a sphere
[3:42:19.880 --> 3:42:25.400]  uh so in an explosive event this molten iron which is the byproduct if
[3:42:25.400 --> 3:42:30.440]  there might uh is is dispersed atomized and and it this is how this
[3:42:30.440 --> 3:42:33.800]  happens it's the only way it could happen we're told well the the welders
[3:42:33.800 --> 3:42:37.080]  down on the site cutting the steel could make spheres
[3:42:37.080 --> 3:42:41.720]  well they can't make billions of them and send them 20 minutes away to the
[3:42:41.720 --> 3:42:47.000]  brooklyn bridge uh these explanations make no
[3:42:47.000 --> 3:42:51.720]  and they can't magically have the spheres be made up of the exact compounds
[3:42:51.720 --> 3:42:55.800]  in explosive thermite that's right and attached to the
[3:42:55.800 --> 3:43:01.000]  unignited chip as found in the dust by dr steven jones
[3:43:01.000 --> 3:43:04.680]  and documented in peer-reviewed journals like the
[3:43:04.680 --> 3:43:08.600]  the open civil engineering journal and others uh it's
[3:43:08.600 --> 3:43:12.360]  it's now now what effect is this having i mean you've gone in a year and a half
[3:43:12.360 --> 3:43:17.400]  upwards of uh you know 500 plus members i interview you in the film uh
[3:43:17.400 --> 3:43:20.280]  truth rising and you know then you had a couple hundred members
[3:43:20.280 --> 3:43:25.400]  uh now you've got over 550 members and as these are published in peer-reviewed
[3:43:25.400 --> 3:43:28.920]  journals you know that's not you guys writing this your findings are
[3:43:28.920 --> 3:43:32.440]  being seconded by prestigious journal after journal
[3:43:32.440 --> 3:43:37.800]  uh it seems like the establishment's got a big problem here richard
[3:43:37.800 --> 3:43:41.800]  uh yeah i hope so but in if if we're having
[3:43:41.800 --> 3:43:45.720]  the the the dialogue in a vacuum and it's not being
[3:43:45.720 --> 3:43:49.320]  published by the mainstream media then is it happening
[3:43:49.320 --> 3:43:52.760]  if a tree falls and no one's there to hear it in the forest
[3:43:52.760 --> 3:43:56.360]  uh does it make a sound you know well in the past it didn't but now the
[3:43:56.360 --> 3:43:59.640]  alternative media is annihilating the mainstream media that's why they're
[3:43:59.640 --> 3:44:03.080]  moving in with internet too in an attempt to shut down the original free
[3:44:03.080 --> 3:44:06.840]  web yeah and it's a huge problem i mean
[3:44:06.840 --> 3:44:10.760]  we have to become our own media i know you're the major proponent of this
[3:44:10.760 --> 3:44:14.600]  and we have to get this evidence out to the american people and it's going
[3:44:14.600 --> 3:44:20.040]  mostly i think word word of mouth uh in addition to alternative media internet
[3:44:20.040 --> 3:44:23.880]  uh it it is happening and there is pressure from underneath if you will
[3:44:23.880 --> 3:44:27.960]  on the mainstream media so every once in a while they have to respond to it or
[3:44:27.960 --> 3:44:31.480]  they look like uh they're not doing their job and they don't want to have that
[3:44:31.480 --> 3:44:35.080]  appearance do they so we get national geographic to respond
[3:44:35.080 --> 3:44:38.520]  whether it's a hit piece or not dbc doing their hit piece
[3:44:38.520 --> 3:44:42.200]  and people get to see building seven coming down for the first time because
[3:44:42.200 --> 3:44:47.080]  it's never been played after the first day on 9 11
[3:44:47.080 --> 3:44:50.040]  absolutely i've talked about your organization itself
[3:44:50.040 --> 3:44:53.720]  that you found and then i want to go to phone calls
[3:44:53.720 --> 3:45:01.400]  yes uh we are a nonpartisan group of uh it's five five hundred sixty i think
[3:45:01.400 --> 3:45:05.080]  now um the architects and engineers licensed uh and or
[3:45:05.080 --> 3:45:11.880]  agreed and we are looking at all of these uh pieces of
[3:45:11.880 --> 3:45:15.320]  evidence and virtually every architect or engineer we show this
[3:45:15.320 --> 3:45:19.720]  information to uh ends up agreeing with us if
[3:45:19.720 --> 3:45:25.000]  they're willing to sit down with it for a half an hour or an hour or in some
[3:45:25.000 --> 3:45:29.240]  cases uh two hours uh is the length we've been speaking
[3:45:29.240 --> 3:45:32.760]  they they they go my god why didn't i know about this you know
[3:45:32.760 --> 3:45:36.920]  well there's lots of reasons for that but do you agree with the technical
[3:45:36.920 --> 3:45:41.320]  science-based forensic evidence yeah i have to
[3:45:41.320 --> 3:45:45.240]  how then then let's get an investigation to find out
[3:45:45.240 --> 3:45:51.240]  what the other issues are such as obviously if this is thermite and
[3:45:51.240 --> 3:45:55.800]  and al-qaeda didn't have access to these buildings al-qaeda didn't have
[3:45:55.800 --> 3:46:01.400]  access to this high-tech um nanothermite we're talking about some
[3:46:01.400 --> 3:46:05.320]  kind of other operation and the architects and engineers
[3:46:05.320 --> 3:46:08.840]  don't speculate too much beyond that because it's beyond our technical
[3:46:08.840 --> 3:46:13.320]  credibility but what we can do is provide the tools for your listeners
[3:46:13.320 --> 3:46:16.440]  to take the a nine eleven truth dot org link
[3:46:16.440 --> 3:46:20.200]  with the power of our five hundred sixty technical professionals
[3:46:20.200 --> 3:46:23.800]  to their friends to their to the media to their congressman
[3:46:23.800 --> 3:46:27.320]  uh and and really start to to move this through
[3:46:27.320 --> 3:46:30.600]  they say we take a look at this you know you don't even have to say i'm a
[3:46:30.600 --> 3:46:33.400]  conspiracy theorist and here's my conspiracy
[3:46:33.400 --> 3:46:37.160]  that though you say here's a group of technical professionals
[3:46:37.160 --> 3:46:41.000]  look at what they're saying well i'm to them doesn't make any sense to you
[3:46:41.000 --> 3:46:43.960]  i found that's one of the best things to do is say my film in game or terror
[3:46:43.960 --> 3:46:47.800]  storm any of the work i've done you know uh folks that go out and just say hey
[3:46:47.800 --> 3:46:50.840]  this is pretty wild stuff tell me what you think about it
[3:46:50.840 --> 3:46:54.680]  and then you depoliticize it and then they watch it or tell them hey this is
[3:46:54.680 --> 3:46:58.440]  controversial this is you know suppressed stuff
[3:46:58.440 --> 3:47:02.520]  so that they'll watch it and then you unlock a mind and that is priceless
[3:47:02.520 --> 3:47:06.440]  i want to go to some phone calls for you now uh let's talk to warren in
[3:47:06.440 --> 3:47:09.640]  california warren you're on at the air with the founder of architects and
[3:47:09.640 --> 3:47:12.360]  engineers for nine eleven truth richard gauge
[3:47:12.360 --> 3:47:16.920]  hello yes sir yeah i want to make this short but it's going to take a time
[3:47:16.920 --> 3:47:21.080]  i went on google and i put in global hawk
[3:47:21.080 --> 3:47:25.560]  and i went down to images and there's about 20 or 12 pages of
[3:47:25.560 --> 3:47:29.800]  thumbnail pictures of various pictures of the global hawk
[3:47:29.800 --> 3:47:34.520]  and about third of picture down it says global hawk hits pentagon
[3:47:34.520 --> 3:47:38.680]  and it has a explosion and then there's a website under it
[3:47:38.680 --> 3:47:45.000]  then on the next page there's one global hawk pentagon nine eleven and it's
[3:47:45.000 --> 3:47:48.920]  painted in american airlines paint scheme
[3:47:48.920 --> 3:47:52.040]  well there's a lot of debate about what happened to pentagon and the way they
[3:47:52.040 --> 3:47:55.400]  covered up the videos the way the witnesses said they smelled cordyte or
[3:47:55.400 --> 3:48:02.440]  or you basically gunpowder explosives um you know that is a major issue there
[3:48:02.440 --> 3:48:05.400]  and and we've covered it and we've got april gallup coming on next week
[3:48:05.400 --> 3:48:08.840]  his fault sued over this she was in the pentagon and didn't see any plane didn't
[3:48:08.840 --> 3:48:12.040]  see any wreckage and they told her to shut up about it
[3:48:12.040 --> 3:48:15.480]  but you know the stronger evidence really is the control demolition
[3:48:15.480 --> 3:48:19.000]  and then separately the fact that our government which is illegitimate
[3:48:19.000 --> 3:48:23.080]  has staged terror attacks over and over again that are declassified and admitted
[3:48:23.080 --> 3:48:26.520]  i mean there are hundreds of examples where they admit they staged terror
[3:48:26.520 --> 3:48:30.120]  attacks on our troops on our ships or on other countries
[3:48:30.120 --> 3:48:33.240]  to blame it on their enemies we have an illegitimate government
[3:48:33.240 --> 3:48:36.600]  uh that's doing this a group of terrorists and so i find that to be the
[3:48:36.600 --> 3:48:40.840]  strongest politically to make people understand it that well hey
[3:48:40.840 --> 3:48:43.880]  you know i mean if i'm a cop and i'm looking for a serial killer
[3:48:43.880 --> 3:48:50.680]  and uh you know we find uh a murder that has the same mo of the other serial
[3:48:50.680 --> 3:48:52.520]  killings then we you know we go look at the usual
[3:48:52.520 --> 3:48:56.040]  suspect and these guys have done this over and over again so that's why we do
[3:48:56.040 --> 3:49:00.280]  that uh richard gauge your comments on the pentagon
[3:49:00.280 --> 3:49:05.640]  you're right it is a little bit of a mess uh alex uh there's clearly caught
[3:49:05.640 --> 3:49:09.400]  cover up going on at the pentagon they had hundreds of cameras
[3:49:09.400 --> 3:49:13.720]  uh that would have told us what did or didn't hit the pentagon
[3:49:13.720 --> 3:49:20.920]  and they're not releasing them only the uh the unclear uh five frames uh it's
[3:49:20.920 --> 3:49:25.720]  it's a joke they've they they they they came and took the fbi after five or
[3:49:25.720 --> 3:49:30.360]  ten minutes uh the cameras from the hotel and the and the gas station nearby
[3:49:30.360 --> 3:49:36.280]  um so we have enough very hard evidence as you mentioned at the three uh
[3:49:36.280 --> 3:49:42.280]  worst structural failures in modern history uh the the high rises uh that
[3:49:42.280 --> 3:49:46.680]  that have not been properly investigated and then that have their own set of
[3:49:46.680 --> 3:49:51.160]  cover-ups uh to go with and and so the there's some
[3:49:51.160 --> 3:49:54.680]  controversy within the 911 truth movement about the pentagon
[3:49:54.680 --> 3:49:58.120]  so our particular organization focuses on the high rises
[3:49:58.120 --> 3:50:02.600]  instead where there is very little controversy uh about
[3:50:02.600 --> 3:50:06.200]  the mechanisms for for how these buildings were taken down all right
[3:50:06.200 --> 3:50:10.120]  warren thank you so much anything else from california
[3:50:10.120 --> 3:50:13.160]  all right he's gone uh let's talk well we're gonna go to break here when i
[3:50:13.160 --> 3:50:17.560]  come back quickly go to randy ralph uh we're gonna derrick first he says he's
[3:50:17.560 --> 3:50:20.280]  a structural engineer i don't know if he agrees or disagrees
[3:50:20.280 --> 3:50:24.040]  michael linoa and kevin and mass uh in the next hour we've got a bunch of
[3:50:24.040 --> 3:50:28.200]  land rights feudalism issues as we're all basically being driven off the land
[3:50:28.200 --> 3:50:31.720]  micro managed the king has sent out swarms of agents to eat out our
[3:50:31.720 --> 3:50:35.000]  substance as the founders complained in 17
[3:50:35.000 --> 3:50:38.440]  76 on the declaration of independence signed july 4th
[3:50:38.440 --> 3:50:41.560]  but i want to hold richard gauge richard i know you got a busy schedule can you
[3:50:41.560 --> 3:50:45.080]  stay five minutes in the next hour oh you bet now okay good
[3:50:45.080 --> 3:50:49.160]  and then we're going to get uh the president of property rights congress
[3:50:49.160 --> 3:50:53.000]  of missouri russell wood on they want you have to register your premises to
[3:50:53.000 --> 3:50:55.960]  be able to hunt on your own land and pay fines and fees and they say it's a
[3:50:55.960 --> 3:50:59.240]  privilege to hunt on your own land uh separate from having to get all the
[3:50:59.240 --> 3:51:03.240]  little permission slips out a lot have you ever wanted to generate your own
[3:51:03.240 --> 3:51:06.760]  supply of electrical power if so this is going to be the most
[3:51:06.760 --> 3:51:10.760]  important message you will ever hear solar power generators are now available
[3:51:10.760 --> 3:51:14.280]  from solutions from science one of gcn's oldest and most trusted

[3:51:17.480 --> 3:51:21.800]  electrical power when you need it most unlike gas generators a solar generator
[3:51:21.800 --> 3:51:25.960]  runs quietly emits no fumes and produces electricity for free it's like
[3:51:25.960 --> 3:51:30.120]  having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home run some pumps

[3:54:21.160 --> 3:54:24.920]  you and not richard for spreading the and keeping the 9-11 movement strong so
[3:54:24.920 --> 3:54:27.960]  long i mean it's i know people are saying it's seven years or you know it's
[3:54:27.960 --> 3:54:31.960]  been a while but um my question for richard i just
[3:54:31.960 --> 3:54:35.080]  like to know the name of some of your more your books and i had a comment after
[3:54:35.080 --> 3:54:38.120]  that as well um well several videos have been made
[3:54:38.120 --> 3:54:41.480]  with richard's work and we have those available at info wars dot com
[3:54:41.480 --> 3:54:46.600]  their latest film is 9-11 blueprint for truth available at a 9-11 truth uh
[3:54:46.600 --> 3:54:51.320]  dot org uh richard yes that's true it's it's all right there we have not written
[3:54:51.320 --> 3:54:55.560]  a book yet all right well we'll relate to that question i was just
[3:54:55.560 --> 3:54:59.000]  wondering because i go i purposely go to the library to ask for you know
[3:54:59.000 --> 3:55:02.840]  9-11 related books and and you know so when the library is crowded i'll get
[3:55:02.840 --> 3:55:05.560]  weird looks from the librarian because i know the title of the book and i'll
[3:55:05.560 --> 3:55:08.760]  say well what books do you have from vince and boogie elsey so then she has
[3:55:08.760 --> 3:55:11.640]  to say the title and people will look at me like what you know president bush
[3:55:11.640 --> 3:55:15.080]  wanted for murder and you know i i kind of pull a backwards
[3:55:15.080 --> 3:55:19.080]  trick for that but um you know i first i'll recommend going to see end game
[3:55:19.080 --> 3:55:21.240]  first for anybody that's getting into this because
[3:55:21.240 --> 3:55:24.520]  if you watch it it kind of starts and gives you you know it really it resets
[3:55:24.520 --> 3:55:26.760]  the history so you really know what happened
[3:55:26.760 --> 3:55:29.960]  before you go see all this 9-11 stuff and you can see how it relates yeah it
[3:55:29.960 --> 3:55:33.000]  gives it to you in a historical perspective got a jump good to hear from
[3:55:33.000 --> 3:55:35.880]  you let's go to a structural engineer derek from
[3:55:35.880 --> 3:55:39.240]  texas you're on the air with richard gauge go ahead derek
[3:55:39.240 --> 3:55:42.840]  hi alex richard thank you so much for letting me on your air and thank you
[3:55:42.840 --> 3:55:45.720]  so much for all the great work that y'all do
[3:55:45.720 --> 3:55:49.800]  uh... the correction i'm not a structural engineer um that's usually
[3:55:49.800 --> 3:55:53.960]  a civil engineers test that he will my screen just said that so somebody said
[3:55:53.960 --> 3:55:57.160]  that or something close to that for the person answering the phone
[3:55:57.160 --> 3:56:01.240]  yeah i'm a mechanical engineer but i do as a certified welding inspector go to
[3:56:01.240 --> 3:56:05.000]  building the structures and review the structural engineers recommendations
[3:56:05.000 --> 3:56:08.680]  and enforce contract documents by making sure
[3:56:08.680 --> 3:56:11.640]  uh... that they get followed now write a report that says that the structural
[3:56:11.640 --> 3:56:15.240]  engineers recommendations are followed or not followed and make recommendations
[3:56:15.240 --> 3:56:20.120]  as to how they can be remedied but i want to get to the quick and
[3:56:20.120 --> 3:56:24.120]  skinny about the nist report that came out just a couple months ago
[3:56:24.120 --> 3:56:28.440]  we're suggesting is that this column 79 on floor 23
[3:56:28.440 --> 3:56:31.880]  which had many attachments this is a column that was attached to
[3:56:31.880 --> 3:56:34.440]  or excuse me a floor beam which he said expanded
[3:56:34.440 --> 3:56:37.400]  from a linear thermal expansion from these office fires
[3:56:37.400 --> 3:56:40.600]  and as far as my knowledge the only thing inside these offices are normal
[3:56:40.600 --> 3:56:44.360]  consumables like books papers carpet et cetera
[3:56:44.360 --> 3:56:49.080]  which smolder and burn it at 800 degrees 900 degrees
[3:56:49.080 --> 3:56:53.080]  all hail thermal expansion a new scientific development
[3:56:53.080 --> 3:56:57.640]  in the history of building fires yes and they're suggesting that all this
[3:56:57.640 --> 3:57:02.360]  overcame a connection at column 79 which was also attached to
[3:57:02.360 --> 3:57:06.440]  four other floor beams as well as the deck connections which are all welded
[3:57:06.440 --> 3:57:10.120]  the joists which are about every two feet they're all welded
[3:57:10.120 --> 3:57:13.960]  and you know there's many many connections not to mention a five inch thick
[3:57:13.960 --> 3:57:18.120]  concrete slab uh... that has reinforcement of steel rebar or
[3:57:18.120 --> 3:57:22.360]  post tension tendons uh... what we need to do is have a finite
[3:57:22.360 --> 3:57:27.240]  element method survey that's applied to this geometry and then put
[3:57:27.240 --> 3:57:30.920]  different initial low conditions in and run the fea software and say
[3:57:30.920 --> 3:57:35.400]  we already know that this is silly but a good fea survey will prove this is
[3:57:35.400 --> 3:57:39.320]  silly and this is something that i promoted on neil con radio and i joy
[3:57:39.320 --> 3:57:43.240]  enjoy doing it when i can one of all the criminals running the government
[3:57:43.240 --> 3:57:48.200]  is not our government they engage in a cover-up of everything so we can't find
[3:57:48.200 --> 3:57:51.640]  out specifically uh... richard gauge
[3:57:51.640 --> 3:57:57.000]  we have to uh... get the information from this in order to do the sd a and they
[3:57:57.000 --> 3:58:01.400]  are closing it is not available whatsoever they they've locked it up
[3:58:01.400 --> 3:58:05.000]  and this is a public investigation and this information
[3:58:05.000 --> 3:58:31.000]  must be made public stay there we'll be right back
