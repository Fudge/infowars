[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:20.440]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex
[00:20.440 --> 00:27.680]  jones well an extremely important broadcast lined up today on this
[00:27.680 --> 00:32.880]  thursday the 17th day of december 2009 we're gonna be live here for the next
[00:32.880 --> 00:39.960]  four hours simulcasting the entire four hours of radio at prisonplanet.tv we
[00:39.960 --> 00:46.640]  are live right now okay we do have the episode posted up on youtube for as long
[00:46.640 --> 00:51.000]  as it's there linked on prisonplanet.com of the three shows I think it's the
[00:51.000 --> 00:57.200]  best I thought the 9-11 piece was the best until I had a chance to see this in
[00:57.200 --> 01:02.240]  its entirety I'd seen pieces of it as a consultant as you can see in the credits
[01:02.240 --> 01:07.120]  for the true TV television show it's the highest rated new show they've ever had
[01:07.120 --> 01:14.040]  and it held its ratings which they never do very very rare usually a premier has
[01:14.040 --> 01:20.200]  the highest ratings or a season finale but it's it's holding at record ratings
[01:20.200 --> 01:26.360]  for true TV and very very exciting jesse ventura I can only saluting this is
[01:26.360 --> 01:30.920]  never before been done this is a anti-new world order show that exposes
[01:30.920 --> 01:35.240]  Maury Strong the Rockefellers the Rothschilds their plan to rob everybody
[01:35.240 --> 01:41.080]  their plan to set up a dictatorship they aired last week a 9-11 piece that
[01:41.080 --> 01:47.960]  exposed the FBI hiding the air traffic boxes the data recorders from the planes
[01:47.960 --> 01:53.320]  and I mean it's incredible that this is airing so I'm gonna play a few minutes
[01:53.320 --> 01:57.320]  of this come back with Lord Christopher Monkton with his report from
[01:57.320 --> 02:01.640]  Copenhagen the latest on what's happening with the public formation of
[02:01.640 --> 02:05.560]  world government but here's a short clip from the hour-long special that aired
[02:05.560 --> 02:09.560]  last night 10 o'clock Eastern on true TV the number one show they've got
[02:09.560 --> 02:13.440]  conspiracy theory with Jesse Ventura
[02:17.640 --> 02:22.480]  Jesse Ventura sets off alone for a meeting with the man he calls his wild
[02:22.480 --> 02:30.680]  card Alex Jones inhabits the conspiracy world as few others he's an expert of
[02:30.680 --> 02:36.520]  world renown he knows the players he knows the connections the whistleblowers
[02:36.520 --> 02:42.280]  and the operatives most important he knows the history Alex good to see you
[02:42.280 --> 02:45.760]  again thanks for meeting me here governor good to see you I believe I may
[02:45.760 --> 02:49.600]  have the information you're looking for good Alex how do we get to Maury Strong
[02:49.600 --> 02:55.080]  he's very hard to get to he rarely does interviews he jetsets all over the
[02:55.080 --> 02:59.080]  planet he's a man without a country he's a major frontman for the United
[02:59.080 --> 03:02.320]  Nations he's been a high-level UN official he also works closely with the
[03:02.320 --> 03:06.800]  Rockefeller family and he is the person behind the call for all these different
[03:06.800 --> 03:12.280]  global taxes the way you get to him is with somebody who 25 years ago worked
[03:12.280 --> 03:17.360]  very close with him and that's George Hunt George Hunt okay he is the consummate
[03:17.360 --> 03:23.320]  insider he was there at the beginning at the embryonic formation of this phony
[03:23.320 --> 03:26.960]  environmental movement that intends to take over the entire planet's resources
[03:26.960 --> 03:32.000]  and set up a form of tyranny so you're telling me that George Hunt is the key
[03:32.000 --> 03:37.120]  he can put the jigsaw puzzled together on this whole global warming thing he's
[03:37.120 --> 03:41.960]  our man on the inside and you can set up this meeting with George Hunt Jesse I
[03:41.960 --> 03:46.840]  will have George Hunt here for you in this warehouse same time same place
[03:46.840 --> 03:50.920]  tomorrow if you can meet with him he can explain the entire agenda the move
[03:50.920 --> 03:56.280]  towards world government the takeover of resources by mega corporations and the
[03:56.280 --> 04:01.240]  shadowy families that control them all of it ties together these are the people
[04:01.240 --> 04:05.560]  that are behind the European Union and the euro I'll meet with them Alex thanks
[04:05.560 --> 04:09.800]  for doing you thank you and I'll be here tomorrow you know George Hunt had
[04:09.800 --> 04:20.640]  better be here and he'd better have the goods coming up he shows up all right
[04:20.640 --> 04:26.080]  the man who makes a direct link between the global warming scare and a plot to
[04:26.080 --> 04:34.440]  rule the world their aims are to create an anxiety about the ecology and global
[04:34.440 --> 04:41.760]  warming and so on they're going to use it to take over the world all right
[04:41.760 --> 04:45.200]  ladies and gentlemen this is groundbreaking nothing like this has
[04:45.200 --> 04:51.000]  ever aired on television I was talking to one of the producers of it and they
[04:51.000 --> 04:54.520]  can't believe that it's being allowed to be aired this is groundbreaking Lord
[04:54.520 --> 04:58.400]  Christopher Monkton was also in this global warming special he's live with
[04:58.400 --> 05:02.080]  us from Copenhagen straight ahead the illusion created by the power elite is

[08:08.600 --> 08:18.080]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network well I am really shaken by how powerful
[08:18.080 --> 08:24.680]  Jesse Ventura's global warming special was on true TV top ratings the top show
[08:24.680 --> 08:29.800]  they've got on the channel that they start out with an open mind and conclude
[08:29.800 --> 08:35.480]  by the end that it's a global government fraud they get Ben santa to admit
[08:35.480 --> 08:40.760]  that he altered UN documents see climate gate is only the latest in what Lord
[08:40.760 --> 08:48.040]  Moncton and others for over a decade of an exposing systematic fraud and I just
[08:48.040 --> 08:53.800]  can't believe they allowed this to air I was talking to Michael Braverman who is
[08:53.800 --> 08:58.200]  the producer of the show Jesse Ventura's manager last night he called me and he
[08:58.200 --> 09:02.280]  said I can't believe they're allowing us to air this I can't believe that they
[09:02.280 --> 09:06.000]  let us come out with the 9-11 information with the harp information now
[09:06.000 --> 09:12.120]  this but it shows that the there's a major power struggle going on right now
[09:12.120 --> 09:15.840]  and a lot of people in the establishment don't want to go into this world
[09:15.840 --> 09:22.800]  dictatorship so major shake-ups happening right now but I am stunned that
[09:22.800 --> 09:29.240]  this aired Lord Christopher Moncton is a big part of the hour-long special he
[09:29.240 --> 09:33.880]  hasn't seen it yet but he joins us for the rest of the hour from Copenhagen
[09:33.880 --> 09:40.680]  Denmark now into week number two Obama and others to speak tomorrow the big
[09:40.680 --> 09:47.440]  grand finale it ends early next week and so joining us from Copenhagen to give us
[09:47.440 --> 09:52.880]  a report on the state of this global government establishment declaration of
[09:52.880 --> 09:56.720]  tyranny it looks like it's in trouble but he's the real expert and is on the
[09:56.720 --> 10:00.680]  ground and can tell us that and what their strategy what their plan B is
[10:00.680 --> 10:05.200]  going to be I have a good idea but I want to get it directly from Christopher
[10:05.200 --> 10:10.040]  Moncton sir thank you so much for joining us well it's a real pleasure to
[10:10.040 --> 10:14.640]  be with you again thank you you're there give us your report on what you've
[10:14.640 --> 10:22.040]  witnessed in the last week and a half and the state of this event well the
[10:22.040 --> 10:26.680]  first thing is it's been very like a Nuremberg rally the people who come to
[10:26.680 --> 10:33.480]  these things are very nearly all of one mind only as a very senior senator from
[10:33.480 --> 10:36.960]  Australia said to me today this morning as we were trying to get into the
[10:36.960 --> 10:42.440]  conference and neither he a senator from the Australia nor nor I you know a
[10:42.440 --> 10:45.600]  member of the House of Lords in Britain albeit without a seat or a vote
[10:45.600 --> 10:49.920]  neither of us could get into the conference today because they were
[10:49.920 --> 10:55.520]  excluding everybody except the delegates and a tiny tiny token handful of
[10:55.520 --> 11:00.120]  outside observers and we whom they had on on their blacklist because we
[11:00.120 --> 11:04.880]  disagreed with what they're trying to do there were not allowed in but what has
[11:04.880 --> 11:09.880]  been going on over the last 10 days is they've been trying to see whether they
[11:09.880 --> 11:14.920]  can get a binding treaty and more or less at the outset they realized they
[11:14.920 --> 11:19.080]  would have to abandon that because it would never pass the US Senate if they
[11:19.080 --> 11:23.120]  call it a treaty it requires two thirds of the US Senate to vote for it and
[11:23.120 --> 11:26.920]  there are just too many blue dog Democrats as well as sensible Republicans
[11:26.920 --> 11:31.760]  who will not vote for the destruction of the US Constitution for the
[11:31.760 --> 11:35.480]  establishment of a world government for the bankrupting of the United States
[11:35.480 --> 11:39.320]  for the destruction of working people's jobs right across the industries of the
[11:39.320 --> 11:43.400]  US all of which will become unprofitable if anything like the original draft
[11:43.400 --> 11:47.640]  treaty had had gone through the word government has now been dropped from the
[11:47.640 --> 11:53.480]  treaty unfortunately all of the principles of all of the the structure
[11:53.480 --> 11:56.800]  the democratic structures I say undemocratic structure I should say
[11:56.800 --> 12:02.920]  of bureaucracy that they're going to put in place these 700 separate new
[12:02.920 --> 12:07.240]  bureaucracy all interlocking with the secretariat of the conference of the
[12:07.240 --> 12:10.880]  states parties to the United Nations framework conventional climate change
[12:10.880 --> 12:15.840]  these are the new entities they're going to bring into being to create this
[12:15.840 --> 12:22.680]  world government those are still in the draft and Ban Ki-moon is clearly
[12:22.680 --> 12:26.640]  expecting he's the head of the UN he's clearly expecting that part of the
[12:26.640 --> 12:30.560]  treaty to go through because he is saying we're going to have to set up a
[12:30.560 --> 12:34.840]  structure of global governance just to handle get this is actually what he
[12:34.840 --> 12:39.320]  admitted yesterday the enormous amounts of money which we are going to be
[12:39.320 --> 12:43.080]  getting from the countries of the West once this agreement goes through at
[12:43.080 --> 12:48.920]  Copenhagen so they are expecting to get this through so all the reports you see
[12:48.920 --> 12:53.760]  about how the parties are fatally deadlocked China has walked out the
[12:53.760 --> 12:56.840]  African countries have walked out everybody's complaining of the Danish
[12:56.840 --> 12:59.920]  government can't be obvious the Danish government says that he can no longer
[12:59.920 --> 13:05.880]  broker an agreement all of these things are the traditional window dressing to
[13:05.880 --> 13:11.480]  try to disarm those of us who don't want any of this to succeed because we would
[13:11.480 --> 13:15.160]  rather like to present so they're playing dead they're playing possum
[13:15.160 --> 13:19.880]  they're they're acting like they've been defeated but but but but you're giving
[13:19.880 --> 13:25.320]  us the dreadful news Lord Christopher Moncton is that you believe they will
[13:25.320 --> 13:30.040]  sign this agreement that really is a treaty but on the surface isn't and
[13:30.040 --> 13:34.760]  then it will be enforced through the bureaucracy I mean that's what Obama has
[13:34.760 --> 13:40.040]  promised he has said to Congress last week quote we will use command and
[13:40.040 --> 13:47.520]  control and circumvent the legislature the parliamentary system setting up a
[13:47.520 --> 13:53.160]  EU style dictatorship through the bureaucracy if he tries to do that he
[13:53.160 --> 13:57.320]  will be impeached the great thing about the United States Constitution is that
[13:57.320 --> 14:02.760]  it does not allow the president to rule on his own it's very clear that there
[14:02.760 --> 14:07.400]  are three branches of the legislature there are the two houses of Congress and
[14:07.400 --> 14:12.560]  there is the executive branch the president and his cabinet and he cannot
[14:12.560 --> 14:19.320]  rule on his own if he tries he will be impeached in fact already there are
[14:19.320 --> 14:23.080]  those in the Republican camp who are beginning to look at the constitutional
[14:23.080 --> 14:26.480]  implications of some of the things the president has been saying he had better
[14:26.480 --> 14:31.240]  tread very carefully at the or he will be out of office and in prison before he
[14:31.240 --> 14:36.280]  knows there are constitutional constraints which thank God may yet save
[14:36.280 --> 14:40.880]  not only America but the rest of the world from what you might be described
[14:40.880 --> 14:45.840]  as a tyranny that is what they had intended and it was I who first revealed
[14:45.840 --> 14:51.600]  when I got the first draft of this dreadful treaty and revealed its content
[14:51.600 --> 14:56.760]  for the world in a speech in Minnesota which has now been seen by 4 million
[14:56.760 --> 15:02.760]  people on YouTube and there's no doubt that this has woken people up to what is
[15:02.760 --> 15:08.600]  really intended here and yes some more is strong in your introduction he said
[15:08.600 --> 15:13.440]  25 years ago that he was intending to turn the United Nations in the
[15:13.440 --> 15:18.200]  governmental panel on climate change into a world government to that end he
[15:18.200 --> 15:22.800]  didn't set it up as a scientific body but as a political body that was his
[15:22.800 --> 15:26.880]  original intention and he has stuck to that throughout you also mentioned
[15:26.880 --> 15:32.840]  Ben Chanta whose various fraudulent attempt to tamper with the scientific
[15:32.840 --> 15:38.280]  report of the UN I have been exposing over the years it was Chanta who on his
[15:38.280 --> 15:46.760]  own rewrote the 1995 UN report on the climate which had been submitted by you
[15:46.760 --> 15:50.920]  know a thousand scientists they'd agreed the tech the bureaucrats were fury
[15:50.920 --> 15:56.280]  that the scientists have said there is no indication of any human influence on
[15:56.280 --> 16:01.200]  global temperature they said it five times they said it clearly they said we
[16:01.200 --> 16:05.080]  don't know when such an effect will ever be discernible Lord Moncton for those
[16:05.080 --> 16:10.440]  that don't know go back in the Jesse Ventura special but but for years you've
[16:10.440 --> 16:16.280]  been exposing Ben Chanta tell people who he is at the UN the direct deputy the
[16:16.280 --> 16:22.440]  minion of Maury strong people that don't know who Maury's strong is and he's now
[16:22.440 --> 16:28.040]  in this TV show Ben Chanta admitting that he did excise that out so another
[16:28.040 --> 16:33.440]  huge climate gate I mean what is new to the public is new this may be old news
[16:33.440 --> 16:36.480]  to people who've been researching it like you but this is a whole another
[16:36.480 --> 16:43.520]  climate gate directly from the UN where they're engaged in fraud that is
[16:43.520 --> 16:48.280]  exactly it what we have clearly got here in this 1995 episode which the John
[16:48.280 --> 16:51.920]  Horton who was chairman of the UN at the time of the climate panel at the time
[16:51.920 --> 16:56.760]  tried to deny had ever happened he said he was unaware of any rewriting he in
[16:56.760 --> 17:02.760]  fact need perfectly well but this has been done because he and others of the
[17:02.760 --> 17:07.360]  UN have later said oh but this was entirely within the UN procedure one
[17:07.360 --> 17:13.120]  man could rewrite the UN's report and say exactly the opposite of what the
[17:13.120 --> 17:17.280]  scientists said because that was what the bureaucrats wanted they didn't want the
[17:17.280 --> 17:21.320]  scientists say there wasn't a problem otherwise this UN climate panel would be
[17:21.320 --> 17:25.000]  closed down and there'd be no world government so they got it to read that
[17:25.000 --> 17:29.600]  they got Santa to rewrite it and he's now admitted on television but that is
[17:29.600 --> 17:33.480]  what he did I believe it's the first time he has admitted it but I had the
[17:33.480 --> 17:38.120]  proof long ago that he's done this I've been saying so in fact I've done a tour
[17:38.120 --> 17:43.640]  of European Parliament in which I have revealed exactly which bits of the
[17:43.640 --> 17:50.320]  1995 report he did rewrite and so now it is much better known than it was that
[17:50.320 --> 17:54.040]  this had gone on and of course he is one of the climate gate emailers he's
[17:54.040 --> 17:59.480]  intimately connected with the people who fraudulently abolished the medieval
[17:59.480 --> 18:05.520]  war period in the UN next report after 1995 which was in 2001 they had to
[18:05.520 --> 18:09.720]  abolish that because while it was plainly warmer in the medieval warm
[18:09.720 --> 18:13.920]  period than today they couldn't play as any exception about today's temperature
[18:13.920 --> 18:19.160]  the 1990 UN report had shown a graph showing that the medieval war period was
[18:19.160 --> 18:23.040]  one or two degrees Celsius warmer than today that's three or four Fahrenheit
[18:23.040 --> 18:28.400]  and they by 2001 they'd swept that away it's the same team connected to Ben
[18:28.400 --> 18:33.360]  Santa by these emails at climate case who had done that and then in the 2007
[18:33.360 --> 18:38.840]  report they produced a bogus graph pretending that the rate of increase in
[18:38.840 --> 18:44.560]  temperatures over the past 150 years has itself been accelerating ever more
[18:44.560 --> 18:49.920]  rapidly as you come closer to the press now that graph was bogus and it was in
[18:49.920 --> 18:56.680]  fact fraudulent and and I saw Rajendra Pachari the chairman of the IPCC at a
[18:56.680 --> 19:02.480]  lecture at the University of Copenhagen two nights ago using that bogus
[19:02.480 --> 19:07.160]  graph which he knew was bogus and so I stood up at the end of his lecture and
[19:07.160 --> 19:12.800]  I gave him a letter which I had written to him explaining why this graph was
[19:12.800 --> 19:18.440]  bogus and I said to him this graph is a fraud you are participating in a fraud
[19:18.440 --> 19:23.200]  by using material of this kind which has long been discredited and the fact
[19:23.200 --> 19:27.520]  that you're still using it is an extremely serious matter and he was very
[19:27.520 --> 19:31.640]  upset and he said oh but use the word fraud that's very unparliamentary where
[19:31.640 --> 19:37.120]  you shouldn't use it but he had absolutely no way of answering the point I had made
[19:37.120 --> 19:43.000]  Lord Christopher Monckton is our guest I want to in layman's terms sir go over the

[24:07.320 --> 24:12.680]  there's a war on for your mind I was talking to Lord Moncton during the break
[24:12.680 --> 24:15.640]  about some of the things I want to cover in the time we have left with him in the
[24:15.640 --> 24:20.880]  shower how they're trying to implement this global government takeover by
[24:20.880 --> 24:25.080]  stealth right now Swartz and anger says they're gonna take over county cities
[24:25.080 --> 24:29.560]  and states that's already going on but then I said I also want to talk about
[24:29.560 --> 24:34.800]  how I keep seeing you in police assault or grab reporters that ask questions
[24:34.800 --> 24:40.560]  even accredited reporters and live on Fox News the maker of Al Gore not evil
[24:40.560 --> 24:44.720]  just wrong which is really a whitewash by the way he is pure evil he's a fraud
[24:44.720 --> 24:48.760]  he knows what he's a he's a would-be slave master that that guy got hit in
[24:48.760 --> 24:53.800]  the head by a bottle I mean they are really attacking people and Lord Moncton
[24:53.800 --> 24:58.240]  told me he was assaulted by a police officer knocked to the ground and had to
[24:58.240 --> 25:05.080]  have the attention of a medic so Lord Moncton you described it I had to luckily
[25:05.080 --> 25:09.760]  I brought up the point of the assaults of people that don't follow the new hit
[25:09.760 --> 25:16.440]  Larry in religion but tell us what happened to yourself and others well I
[25:16.440 --> 25:22.320]  was with Dennis Steve Fielding from Australia and other members of the the
[25:22.320 --> 25:26.120]  group from the committee for constructive tomorrow which is a sensible
[25:26.120 --> 25:31.160]  environmental pressure group and we were all accredited members of this
[25:31.160 --> 25:35.840]  conference we were entitled to go into the conference however yesterday and
[25:35.840 --> 25:41.720]  again today we were turned away by the UN on the flimidious ground because
[25:41.720 --> 25:47.000]  there have been a demonstration by members of other non-governmental
[25:47.000 --> 25:51.160]  organizations totally unconnected with us demonstrations in fact had a
[25:51.160 --> 25:54.960]  completely opposite direction from us but they therefore decided they would
[25:54.960 --> 25:59.760]  exclude everyone even those whom they had invited as they had us and accredited
[25:59.760 --> 26:04.920]  for this conference so when it was plain that we weren't going to be allowed in
[26:04.920 --> 26:09.360]  the police said would you please leave and they began manhandling so I said I
[26:09.360 --> 26:13.800]  put my hand in my pocket first thing you should do I was trained in this by the
[26:13.800 --> 26:19.040]  John Ambulance years ago if the police start to get cratchy as they do this is
[26:19.040 --> 26:23.160]  the Danish police under orders from the UN that's the way it works this new
[26:23.160 --> 26:28.120]  world government is already taking shape they manhandled me physically and I
[26:28.120 --> 26:33.240]  said you will take your hands off me and they then did and the policeman said
[26:33.240 --> 26:36.720]  you know you're a very unpleasant man I said no I'm just not used to being
[26:36.720 --> 26:42.320]  manhandled and please don't do it and I went where he wanted me to go turned my
[26:42.320 --> 26:48.800]  back on him and began to walk away and he hit me very hard from behind knocking
[26:48.800 --> 26:54.680]  me to the ground and knocking me out excuse me excuse me sir a member of the
[26:54.680 --> 27:00.200]  House of Lords the third Viscount of Moncton and Brentially and you're being
[27:00.200 --> 27:08.160]  assaulted by UN controlled thugs attacked from behind again no one is safe
[27:08.160 --> 27:15.200]  from this tyranny no that's right it was a very disfiguring episode and I had
[27:15.200 --> 27:19.400]  done nothing to provoke this except to say please don't manhandle me there was
[27:19.400 --> 27:23.480]  no need for that we were on our way so he knocked you out I mean you are you are
[27:23.480 --> 27:28.280]  knocked unconscious apparently I'm told because I was then out for I don't know
[27:28.280 --> 27:31.920]  I don't know how long I was out for but anyway when I came around there were lots
[27:31.920 --> 27:36.680]  of concerned faces standing around and apparently while I'd been knocked out so
[27:36.680 --> 27:40.800]  my friends who were around me one of them kindly cradling my head stopping
[27:40.800 --> 27:44.600]  being banging on the ground again they were saying oh yes he's just making it
[27:44.600 --> 27:49.640]  up he's just making it anyway the kindly the excellent equivalent of John
[27:49.640 --> 27:56.400]  Ambulance the Danish volunteer ambulance man came and took me away and it looked
[27:56.400 --> 28:00.080]  after me and their ambulance for 20 minutes and put a blank on me and warmed
[28:00.080 --> 28:04.160]  me up and gave me some water to drink and checked my pulse and made sure I was
[28:04.160 --> 28:08.520]  coherent and all right again they were very very good and I made a weed
[28:08.520 --> 28:12.440]  donation to their to their fund because although they're funded by the state
[28:12.440 --> 28:16.920]  they need to get better equipment but excuse me sir I mean I mean to be clear
[28:16.920 --> 28:23.120]  here you were assaulted from behind by a Danish thug a Danish member of the of
[28:23.120 --> 28:26.960]  the government of a police officer and then they did this right he was a police
[28:26.960 --> 28:31.680]  officer who I think let's let's be fair to them they were under pressure from the
[28:31.680 --> 28:38.840]  the very nasty goons who are the the UN police force the Danish police have just
[28:38.840 --> 28:43.400]  become more and more twitchy as this conference has gone on the friction
[28:43.400 --> 28:48.120]  between them and they've also used George Soros UN very very clear they've
[28:48.120 --> 28:52.160]  also I do feel some sympathy for the Danish police here and this poor chap he
[28:52.160 --> 28:55.840]  just didn't know where to turn in the end he just decided he would take a swipe
[28:55.840 --> 29:00.800]  at me and unfortunately knocked me to the ground and knocked me out did he
[29:00.800 --> 29:05.800]  hit you with a billy club in the head sir no no no it was just I mean he had a
[29:05.800 --> 29:10.360]  glove hand and he pushed me a little too hard in the back and knocked me flying
[29:10.360 --> 29:15.800]  so let's not kind of overstate this it was a pretty minor incident but if you
[29:15.800 --> 29:19.840]  did that to him you'd be up on attempted murder charges I would be I would be
[29:19.840 --> 29:23.920]  locked up for assaulting a police officer no doubt about it at all and I'd be sent
[29:23.920 --> 29:27.920]  home in disgrace and never load back into Denmark again he will get off stop
[29:27.920 --> 29:33.280]  free and probably be given a promotion that's the way it now is so I do feel
[29:33.280 --> 29:37.120]  some sympathy to him he was under a lot of pressure from them and of course we
[29:37.120 --> 29:40.000]  have been trying to get into the conference they was under the pressure
[29:40.000 --> 29:43.560]  all right Lord Monkton stay there I want to get into all the other areas to

[32:23.640 --> 32:27.800]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[32:27.800 --> 32:32.120]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[32:32.120 --> 32:35.800]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[32:35.800 --> 32:40.000]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[32:40.000 --> 32:43.400]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions
[32:43.400 --> 32:47.000]  from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at
[32:47.000 --> 32:52.640]  www.mysolarbackup.com that's my solar backup.com remember the government
[32:52.640 --> 33:18.040]  doesn't own the sun so go to my solar backup.com or call 1-877-327-0365
[33:18.040 --> 33:21.600]  well I had to squeeze the information out of Lord Mock and he's too gentlemanly
[33:21.600 --> 33:28.560]  to really tell you what happened to him but he's caught up and really really got
[33:28.560 --> 33:33.240]  thrashed to the ground bad and he is filing a complaint through someone he
[33:33.240 --> 33:37.800]  knows in the Danish parliament and we you know we need to not forgive police when
[33:37.800 --> 33:42.640]  they assault us from behind because if this is allowed to continue next they'll
[33:42.640 --> 33:46.400]  be snatching and grabbing us like what happened at the G20 a few months ago
[33:46.400 --> 33:51.200]  we're uniformed military we're snatching and grabbing peaceful protesters off the
[33:51.200 --> 33:53.920]  streets Lord Monk and I know you don't want to spend too much more time on this
[33:53.920 --> 33:58.400]  but finishing up any other comments about how you were assaulted and how the
[33:58.400 --> 34:03.240]  UN I mean I've seen countless videos of accredited reporters if they ask about
[34:03.240 --> 34:11.400]  climate gate armed UN police drag them away the the the the the climate cultists
[34:11.400 --> 34:16.480]  on the streets if anyone I mean video after video we have multiple videos
[34:16.480 --> 34:20.480]  posted on info wars.com and prisonplanet.com the day where people are
[34:20.480 --> 34:24.040]  being interviewed they say well I question man-made climate change I think
[34:24.040 --> 34:28.840]  climate gates important bottles and rocks and apples begin hitting them in the
[34:28.840 --> 34:34.280]  face and hissing attacking I mean these are authoritarian thugs not just the
[34:34.280 --> 34:39.520]  police not just the UN I mean the the the acolytes of this when you talk about
[34:39.520 --> 34:44.320]  Nuremberg electric atmosphere and we have Swartz and Eger telling rolling
[34:44.320 --> 34:49.680]  stones he dreams of being a dictator like Hitler at Nuremberg he now is is
[34:49.680 --> 34:55.000]  emerging as the leader openly saying in in French news agency in the
[34:55.000 --> 35:00.360]  telegraph and others that he's going to lead a movement to bypass the US
[35:00.360 --> 35:05.760]  government the federal government at the state and city level to implement this
[35:05.760 --> 35:10.480]  global governance grid he says global governance and planetary transformation
[35:10.480 --> 35:16.640]  is this not sedition by Swartz and Eger saying he will come into our nation as a
[35:16.640 --> 35:21.480]  usurper and bypass the Senate well I think we're covering quite a lot of
[35:21.480 --> 35:25.040]  ground there starting off with I think what we was put into perspective as a
[35:25.040 --> 35:30.280]  relatively small incident I mean okay yes I'm a peer of the realm but no
[35:30.280 --> 35:33.920]  policeman shouldn't be going around bashing people in the back but I think
[35:33.920 --> 35:38.080]  the poor guy hadn't realized that he sort of overdid it a bit he hadn't
[35:38.080 --> 35:41.280]  intended to knock it on the ground it was just unfortunate that I was in a
[35:41.280 --> 35:45.720]  particular position where when he hit me I tripped over and fell flat on my face
[35:45.720 --> 35:51.720]  I don't think he meant it I do think he should of having been warned not to put
[35:51.720 --> 35:55.600]  his hands on me he shouldn't have done that and I think in due course he will
[35:55.600 --> 36:00.480]  be disciplined and probably put down a rank for a year or two to remind him
[36:00.480 --> 36:05.760]  that you don't treat people that way so let's let's not over magnify that and I
[36:05.760 --> 36:11.120]  do feel a lot of sympathy for the police in that they are clearly being under
[36:11.120 --> 36:17.680]  orders from these very very nasty flinty face goons of the UN security force
[36:17.680 --> 36:22.120]  who are hated by act of it everybody who's come into contact with them they
[36:22.120 --> 36:28.280]  are very spooky people indeed and it is quite unfortunate that the UN when it
[36:28.280 --> 36:33.320]  runs these conferences doesn't allow the local police to run the show it sends its
[36:33.320 --> 36:38.400]  own dreadful people in and they are really hated in theater those are those
[36:38.400 --> 36:42.240]  of the ones I ultimately have responsible for the events we've seen you know
[36:42.240 --> 36:46.960]  the daily police laying in not just to our side to be fair but also to
[36:46.960 --> 36:51.000]  demonstrate it from the other side with Trump's I mean they've been bashing them
[36:51.000 --> 36:56.040]  and that's that's also been shown on television worldwide and it has led me
[36:56.040 --> 37:00.960]  and other comments that perhaps the Danes and the UN didn't quite understand
[37:00.960 --> 37:06.080]  what being in a democracy is all about so moving on from that then to Schwarzenegger
[37:06.080 --> 37:10.640]  and him saying that this is such a pressing problem that he's going to
[37:10.640 --> 37:15.600]  circumvent the government I don't think he'll get away with that he too could
[37:15.600 --> 37:20.240]  find himself in peace if he tries to go against the US Constitution the
[37:20.240 --> 37:25.160]  Constitution is there and we now see what an important document it is
[37:25.160 --> 37:29.360]  regarded by Obama and his people and they said this during election campaign
[37:29.360 --> 37:34.040]  as a piece of paper that is now an obstacle to what the left wishes to
[37:34.040 --> 37:37.800]  achieve internationally and Schwarzenegger although he's nominally a
[37:37.800 --> 37:41.920]  Republican is clearly more and more identifying himself with the effectively
[37:41.920 --> 37:44.680]  and I'm going to use the word the communist left that are now running
[37:44.680 --> 37:50.480]  America and much of much else and I think what we have to do is to say that if
[37:50.480 --> 37:54.800]  anybody breaks the law in the way that Schwarzenegger is supposed to do then
[37:54.800 --> 37:59.720]  however high and senior they may be in their local area they will be taken to
[37:59.720 --> 38:04.280]  task and taken if necessary to court for that so I don't think that he's going to
[38:04.280 --> 38:08.000]  get away with that I think that's mere Rodamond party of the thought that you
[38:08.000 --> 38:13.120]  get it they overstate everything for the entry much of the UN has been doing all
[38:13.120 --> 38:18.480]  along about and so we shouldn't get too excited by that if he tries to do
[38:18.480 --> 38:22.720]  anything of that kind he will get stopped eventually because well well
[38:22.720 --> 38:27.240]  yes sir but I mean Lord Moncton here's a quick example he couldn't get the
[38:27.240 --> 38:32.080]  legislature of California to pass taxes on all televisions and ban them
[38:32.080 --> 38:37.000]  above 40 inches saying he you know he's the Gropin Führer the group Führer
[38:37.000 --> 38:43.160]  he's going to decide as the cowlider what type of TV you can have so he just
[38:43.160 --> 38:48.200]  ordered the California Department of Energy to do it by fiat now he is
[38:48.200 --> 38:53.040]  calling for a summit of mayors and they the UN had a summit of mayors there to
[38:53.040 --> 38:57.440]  have the cities levy the taxes a bunch of other U.S. cities are doing this I
[38:57.440 --> 39:02.520]  know some of the governments in England that the I mean in the United States and
[39:02.520 --> 39:05.720]  it's the same all over the Western world for those that don't know you have the
[39:05.720 --> 39:09.080]  federal government you have the state governments and cities and counties and
[39:09.080 --> 39:15.040]  and local municipalities are chartered through the state constitution so this
[39:15.040 --> 39:19.920]  is a form of rebellion to have Swartz and Eggers saying we're going to go to
[39:19.920 --> 39:25.920]  cities to have them begin the looting and and and the rendering of booty to the
[39:25.920 --> 39:29.560]  international organizations we have the UN just as they've gone into the
[39:29.560 --> 39:33.120]  universities and taken them over actively trying to take over our
[39:33.120 --> 39:37.320]  communities and we need to route them out that's my only point right and you're
[39:37.320 --> 39:43.560]  quite right and the way to do that is to make sure that any state or local
[39:43.560 --> 39:50.240]  organization that's overstepping powers is taken to court under the ultra
[39:50.240 --> 39:54.440]  virus that means anything that is beyond your power ultra virus in that
[39:54.440 --> 39:59.640]  that's the court phrase it you aren't allowed to do that and it is not
[39:59.640 --> 40:06.920]  permissible for local administration to live in federal taxes so if they try to
[40:06.920 --> 40:12.320]  start playing that game all it takes is one good to take them to court for the
[40:12.320 --> 40:17.000]  federal court and say look this is not allowed is it the federal court will
[40:17.000 --> 40:21.360]  look at it and say no it is and they will impose whatever penalties are
[40:21.360 --> 40:24.560]  necessary whatever orders of the court are necessary stop the local
[40:24.560 --> 40:29.600]  administration doing this so you do still have a constitution in the United States
[40:29.600 --> 40:36.320]  that basically works and if anyone like the EPA or local government or state
[40:36.320 --> 40:44.240]  government try to overtop the rights of the US legislature to make and unmake
[40:44.240 --> 40:49.360]  the laws that you elected them to make an uptake then you will be defending your
[40:49.360 --> 40:54.120]  democracy if you take them to court and say we will not have this imposed upon
[40:54.120 --> 40:58.000]  us we're doing this in the UK all the time because we recently had our local
[40:58.000 --> 41:03.560]  government trying to impose some damn full tax on us and they said they had the
[41:03.560 --> 41:08.520]  right to do this under some European directive or another and we said no you
[41:08.520 --> 41:12.200]  don't have the right to do that to us and we are not paying and if you try to
[41:12.200 --> 41:16.200]  make us pay we will take you to court and they were so frightened but they said
[41:16.200 --> 41:20.040]  okay we'll you know we'll leave you alone so clearly when you stand up and
[41:20.040 --> 41:25.200]  fight to this illegal strategy they fold but the question is will we stand and
[41:25.200 --> 41:29.960]  fight now I want to get into strategy in layman's terms you're probably the
[41:29.960 --> 41:33.360]  leading expert in the world not just on the science from studying it and
[41:33.360 --> 41:36.720]  interviewing all the scientists but on how their fraud works how their
[41:36.720 --> 41:41.000]  organization works how their propaganda works how their bureaucracy their take
[41:41.000 --> 41:45.720]  over by stealth works specifically Lord Christopher Monkton joining us live in
[41:45.720 --> 41:50.520]  the final days the climax of the summit tomorrow into next week as
[41:50.520 --> 41:54.760]  specifically you're saying that they are going to get an agreement it's going to
[41:54.760 --> 42:00.240]  be a stealth agreement explain that to us and what you expect to happen tomorrow
[42:00.240 --> 42:06.040]  with Obama and what we can do understanding their cloaked attack
[42:06.040 --> 42:11.160]  profile right the first thing they will do and the one thing that I think they
[42:11.160 --> 42:16.040]  were always going to succeed in doing at this conference is to agree to establish
[42:16.040 --> 42:21.720]  what it will be delicately called the institutional framework now that is a
[42:21.720 --> 42:25.960]  code word for world government they're no longer calling it world government
[42:25.960 --> 42:31.680]  because they tried that I spotted it I publicized it the world went ah we're
[42:31.680 --> 42:35.680]  not having that and so they've they've been they've beaten off from using the
[42:35.680 --> 42:39.960]  word but they're going to keep the structure they're going to use this
[42:39.960 --> 42:45.160]  conference this the agreement that they will reach here to set up the
[42:45.160 --> 42:49.400]  institutional framework which means in effect the world government and they're
[42:49.400 --> 42:54.760]  going to take from the Western countries the very large financial resources
[42:54.760 --> 43:00.160]  required to do that that's the one thing they are definitely going to succeed in
[43:00.160 --> 43:05.360]  doing here and they will announce that as a victory in itself and they will be
[43:05.360 --> 43:10.960]  right because that is the one and only single aim of this entire global warming
[43:10.960 --> 43:17.240]  on it is to establish the mechanism structure and above all the funding for
[43:17.240 --> 43:20.920]  a world government and that is what they're going to get agreement for and
[43:20.920 --> 43:25.840]  they will disguise it by saying we're setting up a ten billion dollar fund or
[43:25.840 --> 43:30.520]  a hundred billion dollar funds for adaptation to climate change in third
[43:30.520 --> 43:36.280]  world countries but actually this money will almost all be gobbled up by the
[43:36.280 --> 43:41.920]  international bureaucracy and because of the way that government now hide from
[43:41.920 --> 43:47.200]  their people how it is they're spending the people's money and exactly how much
[43:47.200 --> 43:50.760]  is going to international organizations when I had a question put down in the
[43:50.760 --> 43:54.440]  House of Lords about how much Britain had given to the UN's climate panel over
[43:54.440 --> 43:59.520]  the years the answer I got was we do not have this information well of course they
[43:59.520 --> 44:03.800]  have the information but they're not going to tell us and the difficulty will
[44:03.800 --> 44:10.080]  be in finding out what they are actually doing but if they declare that they are
[44:10.080 --> 44:15.120]  going to do this and they don't have the constitutional authority and that will
[44:15.120 --> 44:19.400]  certainly be the case in the United States then it is possible for you in the
[44:19.400 --> 44:24.120]  United States to fight it and stop them paying the money to this organization
[44:24.120 --> 44:28.440]  unless it can be shown that they have the constitutional authority to do it.
[44:28.440 --> 44:37.200]  Absolutely Lord Mountain. They don't have that constitutional authority unless this is a treaty and unless it is ratified by the Senate.
[44:37.200 --> 44:42.560]  So I think that with luck anything that comes out in just the form of a
[44:42.560 --> 44:48.280]  constitutional of an executive agreement will be something which you can
[44:48.280 --> 44:53.480]  overthrow and defeat and say no to even though the Supreme Court will bend over
[44:53.480 --> 44:57.800]  backwards to what Obama wants in the end it does have to uphold the
[44:57.800 --> 45:02.720]  Constitution and it can't I think countenance the circumvention of the
[45:02.720 --> 45:07.280]  Constitution by the executive agreement procedure on a treaty with such major
[45:07.280 --> 45:13.240]  financial implications as this. Okay Lord Christopher Mountain again sorry to be
[45:13.240 --> 45:16.400]  interrupting but I want to move into some other areas and get your expertise on
[45:16.400 --> 45:21.680]  them I want to play a short clip but this is a story up on prisonplanet.com
[45:21.680 --> 45:30.000]  infowars.net Steve Watson out of the UK wrote it Rothschild talks about the
[45:30.000 --> 45:35.720]  difficulty of global government's agenda at Copenhagen so he talks about the
[45:35.720 --> 45:40.480]  difficulty of selling this so I want to play the clip and then ask you Lord
[45:40.480 --> 45:44.120]  Mountain why did they deny world government for so long when it was in
[45:44.120 --> 45:47.920]  their own documents then they came out in the last couple months and admitted
[45:47.920 --> 45:52.440]  okay it's global government run by private groups and then now they're
[45:52.440 --> 45:56.440]  retreating from that but still pushing the agenda it appears on the surface
[45:56.440 --> 46:04.680]  that they are really beginning to show real signs of stress and that this is a
[46:04.680 --> 46:09.520]  mortal wound that climate gay is literally hemorrhaging all of their
[46:09.520 --> 46:14.720]  support but here is the short clip yeah it's past the point of talking we know
[46:14.720 --> 46:19.520]  historically that the global governance that sort of agenda to these issues is
[46:19.520 --> 46:23.160]  very hard to try and is with all the best intentions it's very hard to actually
[46:23.160 --> 46:26.800]  activate we're seeing that right now we're seeing a lot of fragmentation
[46:26.800 --> 46:29.960]  going on in Copenhagen a lot of different agendas pulling in different
[46:29.960 --> 46:33.200]  directions and I think what we're what we really need to see is people on the
[46:33.200 --> 46:37.000]  ground starting to actually act upon the low-hanging fruit and start to try and
[46:37.000 --> 46:41.920]  move on the solutions that we have a hand okay so that's the headline Rothschild
[46:41.920 --> 46:46.840]  ruse difficulty of advancing global governance agenda at Copenhagen that was
[46:46.840 --> 46:52.160]  on Bloomberg television Lord Moncton yeah I think he's right I think I think they
[46:52.160 --> 46:57.160]  are finding it difficult because they got caught out you see let's remember how
[46:57.160 --> 47:01.760]  they hid this treaty with the word government what they did was they put
[47:01.760 --> 47:06.200]  it on the website of the conference they parted to the so-called convention on
[47:06.200 --> 47:11.640]  climate change but they called it a note by the secretariat and it was only a
[47:11.640 --> 47:15.480]  vigilant friend of mine who realized it too large with just a note by the
[47:15.480 --> 47:20.240]  secretariat two bigger files he opened it found this treaty buried at the back
[47:20.240 --> 47:25.960]  of the boat 186 pages at the back of a two-page note and there in it when I
[47:25.960 --> 47:31.400]  read it was this business in annex one of paragraph 36 38 about a world
[47:31.400 --> 47:34.960]  government was going to take over all the financial and other markets but it
[47:34.960 --> 47:40.040]  has nothing as a pre-market anymore as lavish taxation etc etc huge powers
[47:40.040 --> 47:45.240]  never had any government worldwide had some powers and they got caught out
[47:45.240 --> 47:49.040]  they had hoped they could leave it there and then when they got this through at
[47:49.040 --> 47:52.240]  Copenhagen and people started getting things we hadn't realized it meant this
[47:52.240 --> 47:56.680]  they would have said but it was on our website all the time that was the cheesy
[47:56.680 --> 48:00.760]  game they were trying to play and they didn't get away with it because it was
[48:00.760 --> 48:05.800]  publicized because particularly in the United States people stood up and got in
[48:05.800 --> 48:10.480]  touch with their legislators and we are not having this this treaty shall not
[48:10.480 --> 48:15.400]  pass it became really impossible for them to get away with it in the way that
[48:15.400 --> 48:19.600]  they had originally hoped they still hope that by making it an agreement by
[48:19.600 --> 48:23.760]  taking out the word government but by leaving in all the institutional
[48:23.760 --> 48:28.360]  framework which is what they're now calling the world they might still get
[48:28.360 --> 48:32.480]  away with it and now what Rothschild is saying is even that is proving
[48:32.480 --> 48:36.880]  problematic because there are so many pressures particularly from ordinary
[48:36.880 --> 48:41.560]  American citizens getting in touch with their legislators using their last few
[48:41.560 --> 48:48.200]  days of democracy and freedom to fight to keep it that way that is what above
[48:48.200 --> 49:04.040]  all else has helped the rail we just lost our guest so we will reconnect with
[49:04.040 --> 49:14.240]  him as soon as we can that actually sound like a power outage to me I will
[49:14.240 --> 49:22.360]  get Lord Moncton back on the line with us and a lot of phone troubles lately but
[49:22.360 --> 49:25.480]  but think about it world government is now out in the open and they go on
[49:25.480 --> 49:29.660]  international Bloomberg TV and say oh yes people don't like our global
[49:29.660 --> 49:35.000]  governance so we've got to go with a low-lying fruit and what is the low lying
[49:35.000 --> 49:44.000]  fruit we're gonna ask Lord Moncton that question now sir can you hear me again
[49:44.000 --> 49:48.720]  yes I can loud and clear okay well the the the miracle of technology we're
[49:48.720 --> 49:51.920]  talking to you in Europe we're here in the United States what is the low lying
[49:51.920 --> 49:55.040]  fruit he's talking about is that what what you're discussing of how they're
[49:55.040 --> 49:59.080]  gonna do this by stealth through the bureaucracy and through just getting
[49:59.080 --> 50:03.920]  national governments to just give tax money to this body like they've been
[50:03.920 --> 50:08.320]  doing in the past that's right what they'll do is they'll start with the
[50:08.320 --> 50:13.400]  institutional framework that this is the world government structure because that
[50:13.400 --> 50:18.400]  doesn't require any agreement about how much the Western countries will pay
[50:18.400 --> 50:22.960]  towards the poor countries how much money the poor countries will get how
[50:22.960 --> 50:27.640]  much CO2 emissions Western countries will have to reduce ditto ditto all of
[50:27.640 --> 50:33.040]  that difficult stuff they won't do they will do the easy bit of the easy bit
[50:33.040 --> 50:37.200]  bureaucratically has always agreed to set up a bureaucracy all bureaucraties
[50:37.200 --> 50:41.120]  are very good at setting up new bureaucracy so that's that's what that's
[50:41.120 --> 50:46.160]  what he means by low-hanging fruit he means let's set up the world government
[50:46.160 --> 50:50.320]  and that's what they're going to do and I think that's the one outcome which is
[50:50.320 --> 50:55.280]  more or less guaranteed from tomorrow's final negotiations but this conference
[50:55.280 --> 51:00.320]  is actually due to end tomorrow it will in fact go into an all night stay there

[52:11.720 --> 52:15.280]  pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I have tremendous
[52:15.280 --> 52:20.360]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[52:20.360 --> 52:25.440]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention
[52:25.440 --> 52:29.640]  full of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal off
[52:29.640 --> 52:34.760]  short cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing

[52:38.760 --> 52:42.680]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[52:42.680 --> 52:48.240]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of

[54:16.560 --> 54:20.440]  well Lord Christopher Monkton has been very very gracious to be with us he has
[54:20.440 --> 54:24.600]  another interview coming up with us five minutes into the next hour so
[54:24.600 --> 54:30.160]  specifically the the talks are in trouble they are somewhat of a failure but
[54:30.160 --> 54:34.400]  but you're saying they will get their structure of global government and that
[54:34.400 --> 54:40.120]  is a great defeat to liberty but we then need to oppose it you're saying really
[54:40.120 --> 54:44.560]  the final day is tomorrow it may go into Saturday Lord Monkton explain that to
[54:44.560 --> 54:50.080]  us yes tomorrow is the final full day of the of the conference and the way the
[54:50.080 --> 54:54.800]  script for these things usually works as I said earlier we've had the leaked
[54:54.800 --> 54:57.960]  document by the Danish government at the beginning that's part of the standard
[54:57.960 --> 55:01.760]  script we've had the delegations walking out first the Africans in the Chinese
[55:01.760 --> 55:05.320]  that's part of the standard script then we've had the demonstrations with the
[55:05.320 --> 55:09.160]  function wielding police that happened earlier earlier this week that's part of
[55:09.160 --> 55:12.800]  the script then we have the endless news that it's all going to be a complete
[55:12.800 --> 55:16.160]  failure and nothing will be agreed at all that's part of the standard script
[55:16.160 --> 55:20.640]  then we will get and you heard it here first the all-night session at the end
[55:20.640 --> 55:24.600]  during which Obama calls them all together and says come on cap we've got
[55:24.600 --> 55:29.600]  to go the last mile we've got to get the agreement and what they will agree at the
[55:29.600 --> 55:32.960]  end of the all-night session when they come out with their stubbley chin and
[55:32.960 --> 55:37.960]  their one faces the back of the eyes and the smile saying we've done it they will
[55:37.960 --> 55:42.760]  agree on the one thing which is what the UN has wanted all along and Morris
[55:42.760 --> 55:46.240]  Johnson once along they will agree on what is being called the institutional
[55:46.240 --> 55:50.760]  framework but which is actually these interlocking bureaucracies very
[55:50.760 --> 55:55.880]  expensive and very powerful that will constitute the world government once
[55:55.880 --> 56:00.000]  they've got the bureaucraties in place they will gradually by successive
[56:00.000 --> 56:05.280]  treaties and agreements down the years transfer more and more power to the
[56:05.280 --> 56:09.800]  bureaucracy so the key thing they've got to achieve here if they don't keep it
[56:09.800 --> 56:14.960]  here they never will is to get this bureaucracy in place that is what they're
[56:14.960 --> 56:21.160]  going to agree but if they can't get the United States Senate to sign on then
[56:21.160 --> 56:25.640]  how do they get it through I guess they just continue by by stealth death by a
[56:25.640 --> 56:31.640]  thousand cuts just like EU expansion was built they'll do it first of all see
[56:31.640 --> 56:35.480]  with all the countries that do agree and then the United States will find
[56:35.480 --> 56:41.080]  herself isolated that would be the game and even a huge pressure on Obama to
[56:41.080 --> 56:47.640]  conform he will then try to find ways of covertly funding and he finds us that
[56:47.640 --> 56:51.240]  he can't do that because I think the Republicans in the Senate in
[56:51.240 --> 56:55.240]  particular have woken up to the dangers now and they're going to fight it if you
[56:55.240 --> 57:00.080]  tried anything unconstitutional but eventually the hope will be that if you
[57:00.080 --> 57:03.640]  put the bureaucracy there you get all the other nations start funding it
[57:03.640 --> 57:07.520]  eventually you will get a U.S. administration that will just get too
[57:07.520 --> 57:11.560]  tired of resistance it will eventually so we need to get on the offensive and
[57:11.560 --> 57:16.840]  start removing their bureaucracy so overall is climategate is this year's
[57:16.840 --> 57:20.920]  Copenhagen what the UN called the most important meeting ever is this a defeat
[57:20.920 --> 57:27.160]  for them a setback I mean as a general in 60 seconds to the troops Lord
[57:27.160 --> 57:33.400]  Moncton what is our situation what is your report your briefing to us what is
[57:33.400 --> 57:38.800]  the state of our fight my briefing to you is this world government is coming
[57:38.800 --> 57:44.560]  because the leaders of the West have given up they no longer care about
[57:44.560 --> 57:49.120]  democracy they no longer care about the truth about the climate they are
[57:49.120 --> 57:53.320]  willing to go along with this world government because they see roles for
[57:53.320 --> 57:58.040]  themselves in that world government in exactly the same way as the leaders of
[57:58.040 --> 58:02.560]  the EU did and we saw them wobbling just a few weeks ago who was going to
[58:02.560 --> 58:08.000]  become the first permanent president of this ghastly dictatorial entity because
[58:08.000 --> 58:13.040]  they were going to get more power as president of the EU without ever having
[58:13.040 --> 58:18.040]  to face an election than they would ever have at home and the same thing is the
[58:18.040 --> 58:22.200]  case here and I think the way we can attack this world government which is
[58:22.200 --> 58:27.160]  going to be set up they are going to get away with that is to demand that
[58:27.160 --> 58:32.840]  unless it is an elected government we will have no party absolutely we'll come
[58:32.840 --> 58:36.760]  back with a final five minutes and continue with solutions and asked Lord
[58:36.760 --> 58:43.040]  Moncton was able to wake up any of these climate cultists you are listening to
[58:43.040 --> 58:49.760]  GCN visit GCNLive.com today
[58:51.320 --> 58:55.240]  hi folks this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs

[58:59.920 --> 59:03.840]  solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the
[59:03.840 --> 59:07.720]  lungs the respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne
[59:07.720 --> 59:12.680]  pathogens and viruses the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system
[59:12.680 --> 59:17.960]  with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver
[59:17.960 --> 59:22.560]  nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream with continued legislation

[1:00:00.440 --> 1:00:12.080]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[1:00:12.080 --> 1:00:19.600]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[1:00:19.600 --> 1:00:25.880]  Alex Jones make no mistake we're in a war for liberty and freedom not just for
[1:00:25.880 --> 1:00:30.560]  our children and their children but for current freedom this is authoritarian
[1:00:30.560 --> 1:00:37.560]  tyranny it is despotism these people are tyrants and Lord Moncton and many
[1:00:37.560 --> 1:00:43.280]  others are fighting them I hope everyone will get my DVD in game that exposes
[1:00:43.280 --> 1:00:48.320]  their eugenics population reduction plan for world government and of course

[1:01:11.280 --> 1:01:16.200]  information reports videos exposing the fraud of man-made climate change
[1:01:16.200 --> 1:01:21.640]  science and public policy.org science and public policy.org all right in the
[1:01:21.640 --> 1:01:26.080]  three and a half minutes we have left Lord Moncton on this eve of the final
[1:01:26.080 --> 1:01:32.480]  day of this of the of this wicked summit are we having victories do we have the
[1:01:32.480 --> 1:01:37.680]  initiative where do we stand and then in closing were you able to wake up any of
[1:01:37.680 --> 1:01:43.720]  the of the UN zombies. Let's first of all get one thing clear and that is that
[1:01:43.720 --> 1:01:48.200]  there is no scientific basis for anything that this conference is
[1:01:48.200 --> 1:01:52.360]  proposing to do there is no global warming problem there has been no
[1:01:52.360 --> 1:01:57.480]  global warming for 15 years there has been global cooling for nine years it's
[1:01:57.480 --> 1:02:01.000]  now known from paper after paper in the scientific literature that the effect of
[1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:06.480]  CO2 on temperature is a tiny fraction of what the UN pretends it is the science
[1:02:06.480 --> 1:02:10.800]  is now clear the debate effectively of the scientific community is over there
[1:02:10.800 --> 1:02:14.760]  isn't a problem of course many of the scientists to be making a fortune out of
[1:02:14.760 --> 1:02:19.680]  this don't want to admit it but the science on the science we have won on the
[1:02:19.680 --> 1:02:24.960]  economics also we have won even if the UN were right about the science and the
[1:02:24.960 --> 1:02:31.840]  effect of warming that CO2 has then it would still take 41 years of our current
[1:02:31.840 --> 1:02:36.200]  rate of admission before we had even raised global temperature by a single
[1:02:36.200 --> 1:02:41.960]  Celsius degree so even if we were waiting another 10 years did absolutely
[1:02:41.960 --> 1:02:45.000]  nothing to see which way the temperatures go whether any of this really is
[1:02:45.000 --> 1:02:49.040]  real that will be the cheapest the most responsible thing to do because the
[1:02:49.040 --> 1:02:52.400]  worst that could happen even if we did nothing for that time is an extra quarter
[1:02:52.400 --> 1:02:56.840]  of a degree Celsius which is totally harmless on any view so we won on the
[1:02:56.840 --> 1:03:02.040]  science we won on the economics there is no truth or reality behind any of what
[1:03:02.040 --> 1:03:07.040]  they're saying and yet we are going to lose on the bureaucrats because they are
[1:03:07.040 --> 1:03:12.000]  going to set up a world government how then do we deal with it well I think what
[1:03:12.000 --> 1:03:16.000]  we've got to do is to make it clear that we are still going to regard ourselves
[1:03:16.000 --> 1:03:21.360]  as democratic countries even if they try to take our democracy away and we will
[1:03:21.360 --> 1:03:27.840]  not pay for this monstrous world government and we will not vote for any
[1:03:27.840 --> 1:03:33.440]  u.s. representatives who have any truck with this world we're going to have to
[1:03:33.440 --> 1:03:37.160]  say to our representatives do you support this world government or don't
[1:03:37.160 --> 1:03:42.160]  you because if you don't we will vote you out of office use your democracy
[1:03:42.160 --> 1:03:46.840]  while you still have it try to make sure that any u.s. representatives can go
[1:03:46.840 --> 1:03:51.000]  along whether in the Senate or in the house with the notion of a world
[1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:56.080]  government which you should pay for anyone who supports that on the basis of
[1:03:56.080 --> 1:04:00.880]  what we now know from climategate and confirming my own research is show the
[1:04:00.880 --> 1:04:05.080]  whole thing is fraud as I said the battery I confronted with the word fraud
[1:04:05.080 --> 1:04:10.360]  two days ago and he was very taken aback he was visibly shaken he himself has
[1:04:10.360 --> 1:04:15.680]  enormous financial vested interest this he has continued to be chairman of the
[1:04:15.680 --> 1:04:20.320]  Tata Steel Industries Energy Research Institute which is currently tendering
[1:04:20.320 --> 1:04:26.200]  among other things for an enormous UN contract to clean up the Q80 oil field
[1:04:26.200 --> 1:04:32.280]  and yet he is a senior official of the UN this man deserves to go to jail what
[1:04:32.280 --> 1:04:36.160]  we're going to see I think is that we are not going to tolerate these people
[1:04:36.160 --> 1:04:41.360]  making money out of us and corruptly doing so and and pretending that the
[1:04:41.360 --> 1:04:46.440]  science says what absolutely people some of these people are going to go to jail
[1:04:46.440 --> 1:04:50.440]  and what we will do when this this world government is set up is make it plain
[1:04:50.440 --> 1:04:56.600]  that we will leave absolutely Lord Christopher Monkton thank you so much
[1:04:56.600 --> 1:05:02.160]  for covering Copenhagen for us thank you for spending time with us hundreds of

[1:08:33.880 --> 1:08:41.240]  with us in the last hour breaking down the state of the Copenhagen event and
[1:08:41.240 --> 1:08:46.880]  absolutely as I said days ago that is completely staged on record George
[1:08:46.880 --> 1:08:56.880]  Soros Rockefeller UN Maury strong funded fake hippies so that the Nazi
[1:08:56.880 --> 1:09:02.640]  New World Order can look like it's just a harmless you know dreadlocked sandals
[1:09:02.640 --> 1:09:11.440]  amen save the earth dude kill firstborn babies sterilize everybody cut off the
[1:09:11.440 --> 1:09:20.160]  food to Africa it's liberal oh yeah and they have them attack the police show
[1:09:20.160 --> 1:09:25.320]  that they can show the image oh look protesters are always bad don't ever be
[1:09:25.320 --> 1:09:30.480]  involved in a demonstration or you'll look like these people that have mange
[1:09:30.480 --> 1:09:37.480]  who are attacking police and in every case in the US if they can't get their
[1:09:37.480 --> 1:09:40.760]  hired anarchist or hippies these aren't real hippies there are a lot of great
[1:09:40.760 --> 1:09:44.520]  people that call themselves you know nature people hippies whatever but you
[1:09:44.520 --> 1:09:48.280]  have the counterfeits and a lot of them are well-meaning idiots who buy into the
[1:09:48.280 --> 1:09:52.600]  propaganda at university or they're openly funded by a foundation and
[1:09:52.600 --> 1:09:56.880]  believe what they're doing but a lot of them the beatnik types that are over
[1:09:56.880 --> 1:10:00.440]  them they'll walk right over at many events and just threaten me and go of
[1:10:00.440 --> 1:10:03.560]  course we work for the globalists and we're taking over and I'm gonna get your
[1:10:03.560 --> 1:10:09.400]  money I mean I mean they are just criminals and they're into manipulating
[1:10:09.400 --> 1:10:12.840]  people and they're into the corruption and they're into working for the big
[1:10:12.840 --> 1:10:22.080]  bankers I mean it's just all a giant joke to them and if they can't get groups
[1:10:22.080 --> 1:10:26.360]  of them in place they just have cops dress up like anarchists in Canada in
[1:10:26.360 --> 1:10:32.920]  the US in Italy in Greece I mean this is all in the last year and a half every
[1:10:32.920 --> 1:10:40.520]  major Western country has been caught with federal and local police dressing
[1:10:40.520 --> 1:10:45.640]  up like protesters and attacking police and in most cases they tell the group of
[1:10:45.640 --> 1:10:50.080]  cops they're gonna attack and then they stage it but in some cases they hit cops
[1:10:50.080 --> 1:10:54.080]  in the habit bottles and they hit them on the head with rocks and they punch
[1:10:54.080 --> 1:10:58.440]  them and those are the cases we tend to find out because the cops will then
[1:10:58.440 --> 1:11:02.400]  sometimes tackle them and arrest them and the cops will start begging going
[1:11:02.400 --> 1:11:07.040]  it's me it's me you know code code seven eight nine or whatever yeah I mean this
[1:11:07.040 --> 1:11:13.120]  is on video in Canada we found out in Denver because they had Denver cops
[1:11:13.120 --> 1:11:17.560]  under federal control and part of the intelligence unit go out and attack
[1:11:17.560 --> 1:11:21.720]  another group of riot cops they got mad and beat up some of the some of the
[1:11:21.720 --> 1:11:25.280]  cops that attacked them and then it came out because police started complaining
[1:11:25.280 --> 1:11:29.400]  to the Denver Post I don't like being hit in the head with a rock what are
[1:11:29.400 --> 1:11:35.240]  cops doing this for see they find weak-minded police and they have these
[1:11:35.240 --> 1:11:39.280]  drills these training exercises to fight rioters and they do this out on the
[1:11:39.280 --> 1:11:44.560]  back 40 you know at the military base or at the police training center all over
[1:11:44.560 --> 1:11:49.640]  the country and they'll do it on the back 40 and then they say you know how we
[1:11:49.640 --> 1:11:54.160]  did that simulation we're gonna have some live training today you're gonna
[1:11:54.160 --> 1:12:00.640]  march over to those cops and you're gonna hit them and the cops don't ask
[1:12:00.640 --> 1:12:06.040]  questions you know they don't say well do they know I'm coming they just do it
[1:12:06.040 --> 1:12:13.200]  it police you have to start thinking for yourselves you have to start doing this
[1:12:13.200 --> 1:12:18.720]  I mean I remember in 1999 they had the fortune 500 in Austin and I knew a
[1:12:18.720 --> 1:12:22.680]  little bit about provocateurs but I'm there in these giant anarchists I mean
[1:12:22.680 --> 1:12:27.000]  a real anarchist is like a meth head who's got a pension fund weighs about
[1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:32.880]  120 pounds you know has his pot marks all over their face giant pentagram
[1:12:32.880 --> 1:12:38.000]  tattoos on their chest and they're and they're wearing mousy tongue hats saying
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:42.600]  they're an anarchist when communism supposedly the opposite of that I mean
[1:12:42.600 --> 1:12:47.640]  that's your low-level well-meaning idiot who's being run by a by a federal
[1:12:47.640 --> 1:12:51.840]  informant and I've always warned people about this and it just came out big
[1:12:51.840 --> 1:12:55.560]  federal informants setting up anarchists locally and trying to get them to fire
[1:12:55.560 --> 1:13:00.280]  bomb basically our organization that we're involved with brave new books but
[1:13:00.280 --> 1:13:04.400]  luckily that was exposed but now there's all sorts of other connections to the
[1:13:04.400 --> 1:13:10.120]  firebombing of the capital of the governor's mansion and and a murder of
[1:13:10.120 --> 1:13:13.920]  a Palestinian activist who was gutted and tortured to death and I mean these
[1:13:13.920 --> 1:13:19.400]  people mean business that we're dealing with here but it's a bunch of Trotsky
[1:13:19.400 --> 1:13:24.080]  it's basically running around and because they're just revolutionaries
[1:13:24.080 --> 1:13:29.600]  they're not fascist they're not communist they're bank robbers and they
[1:13:29.600 --> 1:13:33.400]  mean business and they want to bring this country down because if you run
[1:13:33.400 --> 1:13:39.840]  government you're the king and that's who works for these big banks and the
[1:13:39.840 --> 1:13:44.480]  military doesn't have a clue what's going on I mean people better get the
[1:13:44.480 --> 1:13:48.680]  larger game planned down you better figure out their tricks because once you
[1:13:48.680 --> 1:13:52.440]  know their playbook it's like why didn't I see this before why wasn't this
[1:13:52.440 --> 1:13:59.160]  completely obvious now we got guests coming up from Copenhagen with
[1:13:59.160 --> 1:14:04.240]  continual reporting we know we've had mainline reporters on alternative media
[1:14:04.240 --> 1:14:08.360]  we've had members of the House of Lords on we've had congressmen on about
[1:14:08.360 --> 1:14:18.280]  Copenhagen we've got two new American JBS reporters coming on who are really
[1:14:18.280 --> 1:14:29.240]  passe now talk about talk about passe I'm becoming a bit passe you know there
[1:14:29.240 --> 1:14:35.600]  was that shocking undergroundness of Alex Jones is talking about the New
[1:14:35.600 --> 1:14:40.800]  World Order global banks using carbon taxes at 10 years ago I was warning
[1:14:40.800 --> 1:14:45.560]  people because we had you in documents and wow you can only get it from Alex
[1:14:45.560 --> 1:14:50.080]  Jones or only get it from the new American now it's just yeah we're
[1:14:50.080 --> 1:14:54.840]  setting up a global government what's wrong with that so the globalists are
[1:14:54.840 --> 1:14:59.360]  attempting to just throw it out there like it's no big deal and act like
[1:14:59.360 --> 1:15:02.840]  global government's a good thing this is a even of your for global government
[1:15:02.840 --> 1:15:08.000]  this is dictatorial unelected and criminal run by private interest no one
[1:15:08.000 --> 1:15:12.120]  should be for this but they kind of get the hippies and leftists to be like it's
[1:15:12.120 --> 1:15:17.880]  like Star Trek you know the planetary Federation we're gonna help everyone
[1:15:17.880 --> 1:15:25.000]  yeah cutting the food off to the third world that's really gonna help people and
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:30.520]  so just as a lot of conservatives woke up that Bush wasn't a good guy liberals
[1:15:30.520 --> 1:15:35.600]  are gonna have to wake up that their wing of the New World Order it's a wing
[1:15:35.600 --> 1:15:42.720]  creature bird of prey chewing freedoms eyes out you're gonna have to wake up
[1:15:42.720 --> 1:15:45.760]  that you've been conned and that you've been defrauded and that you're
[1:15:45.760 --> 1:15:52.240]  supporting a Hitlerian eugenics agenda so what I'm gonna do is is open the
[1:15:52.240 --> 1:15:55.500]  phones up specifically did you see the global warming special with Jesse
[1:15:55.500 --> 1:15:59.880]  Ventura last night groundbreaking talking about world government New World
[1:15:59.880 --> 1:16:04.680]  Order population reduction planetary taxes run by criminals like Maury
[1:16:04.680 --> 1:16:09.360]  Strong you know showing the UN openly announcing they want a one-world
[1:16:09.360 --> 1:16:17.040]  currency and to get rid of the US currency I mean this was this was better
[1:16:17.040 --> 1:16:21.360]  than the 9-11 special better than the harp special I mean those were
[1:16:21.360 --> 1:16:25.480]  entertaining interesting important the 9-11 was groundbreaking getting into
[1:16:25.480 --> 1:16:30.320]  the inside job and the FBI hiding the flight recorders and the data recorders
[1:16:30.320 --> 1:16:35.320]  that were found at ground zero extremely powerful but I mean this 9-11 special
[1:16:35.320 --> 1:16:42.560]  this one-hour special and I consulted on them all I love all the episodes but
[1:16:42.560 --> 1:16:48.320]  this one just completely blew me away because it start to finish expose the
[1:16:48.320 --> 1:16:53.680]  entire fraud and Ventura admits that he once supported this and that he was
[1:16:53.680 --> 1:16:57.880]  conned and remember Ventura was making this global warming special five months
[1:16:57.880 --> 1:17:03.160]  ago six months ago when they started it and so they just two weeks ago added the
[1:17:03.160 --> 1:17:07.640]  end of it about climategate it was already about fraudulent UN documents
[1:17:07.640 --> 1:17:12.640]  and faking data and all the other frauds they've been caught in I mean this was a
[1:17:12.640 --> 1:17:17.280]  home run and I am so honored to be involved in it I am so honored to be
[1:17:17.280 --> 1:17:23.640]  part of it again I talked to the producer he can't believe it's airing I
[1:17:23.640 --> 1:17:28.640]  mean genuinely they can't believe this is all airing they can't believe it this
[1:17:28.640 --> 1:17:34.040]  is groundbreaking that this is happening and of course it's getting top ratings
[1:17:34.040 --> 1:17:39.880]  on top ratings for the channel top ratings for a new series they almost
[1:17:39.880 --> 1:17:46.880]  never have the same ratings on the shows after the first show this thing's
[1:17:46.880 --> 1:17:52.640]  getting the same ratings are higher in the second and third shows so home run
[1:17:52.640 --> 1:17:56.800]  ultra-exciting ultra
[1:17:56.960 --> 1:18:05.120]  buoying enlightening just showing that we can take the system over as Ron Paul
[1:18:05.120 --> 1:18:10.080]  has talked about doing as Gia Bergriffin has talked about doing we can act like
[1:18:10.080 --> 1:18:15.280]  leaders act like winners because we are winners we are leaders and we have to
[1:18:15.280 --> 1:18:19.240]  start having confidence so many people out there don't have confidence when
[1:18:19.240 --> 1:18:22.200]  you got the truth on your side it doesn't matter if you're out number ten to
[1:18:22.200 --> 1:18:27.640]  one at first you stand up like Mark Twain said in the beginning a patriot is a
[1:18:27.640 --> 1:18:31.720]  scarce man hated feared and scorned but in time when his cause succeeds the Tim
[1:18:31.720 --> 1:18:36.160]  would join him because then it cost nothing to be a patriot now we haven't
[1:18:36.160 --> 1:18:42.840]  reached that point yet our cause has it fully succeeded but it's beginning to
[1:18:42.840 --> 1:18:51.440]  succeed and nothing succeeds like success I mean that's just the way it works
[1:18:51.440 --> 1:18:55.840]  and the globalists get this attitude of invincibility and fallibility you know
[1:18:55.840 --> 1:19:01.040]  the private fellow reserve you can't question them they're God they know best
[1:19:01.040 --> 1:19:05.920]  they've got all the answers you know they're the experts nobody can stop them
[1:19:05.920 --> 1:19:10.480]  you know there's nothing you can do just get with the program you better just
[1:19:10.480 --> 1:19:15.640]  join with them you better just join with Sauron because there's nothing you can
[1:19:15.640 --> 1:19:22.600]  do you better just give into it it's all over you better just go along that aura
[1:19:22.600 --> 1:19:28.720]  is now gone and people are going this is a little potbellied goblin behind the
[1:19:28.720 --> 1:19:33.880]  curtain you're not invincible and people are pulling out their daggers in the
[1:19:33.880 --> 1:19:39.960]  info war and just shanking people well wow it's bleeding yeah
[1:19:39.960 --> 1:19:46.400]  ha ha oh man look at those pelt the blood coming out of the New World Order
[1:19:46.400 --> 1:19:51.120]  here go ahead and give me a machete I mean it's it's you know look at that leg
[1:19:51.120 --> 1:19:57.960]  and and it's now groveling and spewing and threatening but believe me we can
[1:19:57.960 --> 1:20:04.600]  route these people stay with me this is an emergency alert do not take risky
[1:20:04.600 --> 1:20:11.200]  vaccinations this fall I repeat do not take risky vaccinations this fall I'm

[1:24:04.840 --> 1:24:12.320]  the GCN radio network all right I got piles of news on the economy on the
[1:24:12.320 --> 1:24:19.280]  police state on war on Copenhagen we're not winning the war but we're having
[1:24:19.280 --> 1:24:24.400]  some victories and we're gaining ground we're not losing ground we're coming
[1:24:24.400 --> 1:24:29.240]  back from behind I want to give the toll-free number out if you saw the
[1:24:29.240 --> 1:24:34.280]  Ventura program on global warming fraud last night if you want to talk about
[1:24:34.280 --> 1:24:40.320]  anything that Lord Monkton discussed government-run health care may not pass
[1:24:40.320 --> 1:24:47.600]  the Senate this year even if it does Pelosi now they do play possum but I've
[1:24:47.600 --> 1:24:53.280]  looked at it it looks like she's not just playing possum to get people to
[1:24:53.280 --> 1:24:58.120]  stand down that's part of it she also doesn't want it to look like a defeat
[1:24:58.120 --> 1:25:04.960]  if the house isn't able to pass this this year and every day that passes I'd
[1:25:04.960 --> 1:25:11.200]  say 80% chance this bill won't pass this year and by next week it's a 90%
[1:25:11.200 --> 1:25:15.160]  chance and then if we get it into next year more time to expose what's in that
[1:25:15.160 --> 1:25:25.920]  bill there is a 50-50 chance it'll pass because then they'll have more time but
[1:25:25.920 --> 1:25:30.880]  then we can run the clock up on them again so we are at that crossroads right
[1:25:30.880 --> 1:25:37.120]  now and you need to go to your congressman's meeting your senator's
[1:25:37.120 --> 1:25:40.800]  meeting you need to go to their office their local office and tell them you're
[1:25:40.800 --> 1:25:47.200]  gonna be campaigning against them and exposing them you need to physically call
[1:25:47.200 --> 1:25:52.560]  them physically visit them and the fight is gonna be in the house the fights in
[1:25:52.560 --> 1:25:58.080]  the Senate but the real fights in the house with those committees they're
[1:25:58.080 --> 1:26:01.480]  gonna have to go back and forth with the Senate in the house version they're
[1:26:01.480 --> 1:26:07.600]  probably gonna get it this year early next year in the Senate but it's gonna
[1:26:07.600 --> 1:26:14.560]  be two different bills and boy is it bad five years in prison quarter million
[1:26:14.560 --> 1:26:19.240]  dollar fines I mean it's it's it's hard to believe this is really in there but
[1:26:19.240 --> 1:26:25.160]  it is a cutting Medicare and Medicaid you it raises your taxes but then cuts
[1:26:25.160 --> 1:26:30.840]  the benefits because it all goes to the bankers we've got to get the message out
[1:26:30.840 --> 1:26:35.320]  to well-meaning moron collectivist who really think there's such a thing as a
[1:26:35.320 --> 1:26:40.120]  free lunch that hey Dennis Kucinich one of the only real socialist in Congress
[1:26:40.120 --> 1:26:44.880]  you know he's a real collectivist he says this is a boondoggle for the big
[1:26:44.880 --> 1:26:51.800]  banks and insurance companies again read his editorial why I voted against
[1:26:51.800 --> 1:26:57.760]  healthcare bill and he goes on to say in another headline article this is a
[1:26:57.760 --> 1:27:05.120]  bailout for insurance companies they wrote it then they tell you that they're
[1:27:05.120 --> 1:27:11.560]  against it that's the slick propaganda of these people they use psychology and
[1:27:11.560 --> 1:27:18.320]  so you got to reach out to constituents of people like Lloyd dogged here in
[1:27:18.320 --> 1:27:27.320]  Texas and others and just say look I am going to go and vote against you with
[1:27:27.320 --> 1:27:30.680]  whoever has a chance to beat you and then if they're bad we'll vote them out
[1:27:30.680 --> 1:27:38.240]  but we're going to get rid of you politically if you do this so we need
[1:27:38.240 --> 1:27:42.240]  to keep pressure on the Senate because they're losing momentum they they've
[1:27:42.240 --> 1:27:47.120]  almost got it they've almost got it the government getting more control over
[1:27:47.120 --> 1:27:53.360]  our lives and being able to dole out health care to us back when there was
[1:27:53.360 --> 1:27:57.480]  no government involved in health care 30 40 years ago we had much better
[1:27:57.480 --> 1:28:02.040]  health care much lower the more money government pours in to health care the
[1:28:02.040 --> 1:28:07.880]  more the price goes up because they're destroying competition also you know
[1:28:07.880 --> 1:28:11.680]  we've got 30 million illegal aliens in this country who get free health care
[1:28:11.680 --> 1:28:17.200]  we're all fitting the bill for that I mean I don't personally dislike the
[1:28:17.200 --> 1:28:21.200]  illegal aliens but they're bankrupting the country which is what the banks
[1:28:21.200 --> 1:28:25.120]  want they want us dependent they want the state government's bankrupt so they
[1:28:25.120 --> 1:28:29.080]  can come in with even more government is the solution see if the globalist are
[1:28:29.080 --> 1:28:33.320]  for war I'm against it if the globalist are for open borders I'm against it if
[1:28:33.320 --> 1:28:36.360]  the globalist are forgiving themselves more power I'm against it if the
[1:28:36.360 --> 1:28:42.120]  globalist everything they do is criminal it's very simple but you've got to find
[1:28:42.120 --> 1:28:45.800]  out what they're actually against see they know a lot of you figured out that
[1:28:45.800 --> 1:28:51.000]  whatever the establishments for you're against so they come out and say oh big
[1:28:51.000 --> 1:28:57.440]  oil doesn't want the global carbon tax they wrote the plan oh insurance
[1:28:57.440 --> 1:29:05.000]  companies don't want this reform they wrote the plan on record so see you've
[1:29:05.000 --> 1:29:11.680]  got to find out what the elite is really for and then oppose it and they want
[1:29:11.680 --> 1:29:15.280]  this Copenhagen Treaty they want this global government this private global
[1:29:15.280 --> 1:29:21.080]  corporate government and that's why we've got to be against it they want to use
[1:29:21.080 --> 1:29:24.800]  millions of third world people to come in here as a weapon to take over our
[1:29:24.800 --> 1:29:30.880]  voting system and vote for gun control and vote for more tyranny I'm sorry I
[1:29:30.880 --> 1:29:35.080]  read the voting records of these immigrants and they are ignorant people
[1:29:35.080 --> 1:29:40.320]  from lands of tyranny and they vote is exactly as the local socialist pimp
[1:29:40.320 --> 1:29:45.600]  tells them and we better shut down the border and deport these illegals or
[1:29:45.600 --> 1:29:49.960]  we're dead we'll be right back
[1:29:50.480 --> 1:29:57.480]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio

[1:31:03.840 --> 1:31:07.800]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or

[1:31:12.040 --> 1:31:16.320]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[1:31:16.320 --> 1:31:20.680]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[1:31:20.680 --> 1:31:24.760]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[1:31:24.760 --> 1:31:29.320]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[1:31:29.320 --> 1:31:33.440]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[1:31:33.440 --> 1:31:37.200]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar

[1:32:52.200 --> 1:33:00.720]  on the web at eFoodsDirect.com again that number 1-800-409-5633
[1:33:03.720 --> 1:33:08.440]  Jesse Ventura and his team are hot on the trail of a conspiracy to use the
[1:33:08.440 --> 1:33:13.600]  issue of global warming to control your life the investigation has led to a
[1:33:13.600 --> 1:33:18.680]  mysterious shadowy figure Maury Strong is the world's leading environmentalist
[1:33:18.680 --> 1:33:25.580]  who just happens to be a billionaire industrialist Jesse's researchers set
[1:33:25.580 --> 1:33:30.800]  out to track down Maury Strong in China well if we can't talk to this Maury
[1:33:30.800 --> 1:33:36.360]  Strong then who the hell can we talk to while Jun Sarpong has gotten a step
[1:33:36.360 --> 1:33:44.560]  closer to his inner circle I got him Ben Santa Maury Strong's Ben Santa yep
[1:33:44.560 --> 1:33:50.280]  he's the climate researcher they're saying Dr. the UN report apparently they
[1:33:50.280 --> 1:33:54.560]  say he removed everything against global warming and stacked the cards for Maury
[1:33:54.560 --> 1:34:00.080]  Strong. Jun finds Ben Santa working in the highest corridors of power at the
[1:34:00.080 --> 1:34:04.880]  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Northern California. Why do you think
[1:34:04.880 --> 1:34:10.320]  there are so many doubters still? I don't think there are so many doubters
[1:34:10.320 --> 1:34:15.040]  still. You will always be able to go out and find someone who disagrees with
[1:34:15.040 --> 1:34:19.840]  conventional wisdom. June gets to the point did he cook the books on global
[1:34:19.840 --> 1:34:25.320]  warming as Christopher Moncton claims. There is no proven link between human
[1:34:25.320 --> 1:34:28.000]  activity and increases in global temperature five times in different
[1:34:28.000 --> 1:34:31.800]  words they said the same thing very plain. Santa went through crossed out all of
[1:34:31.800 --> 1:34:37.880]  those and substituted a new conclusion. Well Lord Moncton to my knowledge was
[1:34:37.880 --> 1:34:46.560]  not part of the process I was our chapter came to the conclusion a line
[1:34:46.560 --> 1:34:51.320]  that's burned on my my memory forever the balance of evidence suggests a
[1:34:51.320 --> 1:34:57.040]  discernible human influence on global climate. But did he delete sections of
[1:34:57.040 --> 1:35:02.360]  the climate report? Lord Moncton points to deletions from the chapter and there
[1:35:02.360 --> 1:35:06.480]  were deletions from the chapter to be consistent with the other chapters we
[1:35:06.480 --> 1:35:10.560]  dropped the summary at the end. Why do you think there are so many conspiracy
[1:35:10.560 --> 1:35:14.760]  theorists around this issue? People love believing a good conspiracy theory.
[1:35:14.760 --> 1:35:19.800]  There's another reason conspiracy theories come up because people leave
[1:35:19.800 --> 1:35:25.800]  lots of room for doubt. Santa doesn't deny deleting information from the UN
[1:35:25.800 --> 1:35:32.240]  report. He just says he's misunderstood and that leaves a lot of questions about
[1:35:32.240 --> 1:35:37.200]  Maurice Strong. It's time to get the answers.
[1:35:38.760 --> 1:35:43.280]  Jesse Ventura sets off alone for a meeting with the man he calls his
[1:35:43.280 --> 1:35:51.160]  wildcard. Alex Jones inhabits the conspiracy world as few others. He's an
[1:35:51.160 --> 1:35:56.920]  expert of world renown. He knows the players. He knows the connections, the
[1:35:56.920 --> 1:36:02.840]  whistleblowers, and the operatives. Most important, he knows their history. Alex,
[1:36:02.840 --> 1:36:06.280]  good to see you again. Thanks for meeting me here. Governor, good to see you. I
[1:36:06.280 --> 1:36:09.960]  believe I may have the information you're looking for. Good. Alex, how do we get to
[1:36:09.960 --> 1:36:15.960]  Maurice Strong? He's very hard to get to. He rarely does interviews. He jetsets all
[1:36:15.960 --> 1:36:19.920]  over the planet. He's a man without a country. He's a major front man for the
[1:36:19.920 --> 1:36:23.480]  United Nations. He's been a high-level UN official. He also works closely with the
[1:36:23.480 --> 1:36:27.560]  Rockefeller family, and he is the person behind the call for all these
[1:36:27.560 --> 1:36:32.760]  different global taxes. The way you get to him is with somebody who 25 years ago
[1:36:32.760 --> 1:36:37.840]  worked very close with him, and that's George Hunt. George Hunt, okay? He is the
[1:36:37.840 --> 1:36:43.400]  consummate insider. He was there at the beginning at the embryonic formation of
[1:36:43.400 --> 1:36:47.440]  this phony environmental movement that intends to take over the entire planet's
[1:36:47.440 --> 1:36:52.720]  resources and set up a form of tyranny. So you're telling me that George Hunt is
[1:36:52.720 --> 1:36:57.120]  the key? He can put the jigsaw puzzle together on this whole global warming
[1:36:57.120 --> 1:37:01.960]  thing. He's our man on the inside. And you can set up this meeting with George
[1:37:01.960 --> 1:37:07.080]  Hunt? Jesse, I will have George Hunt here for you in this warehouse, same time,
[1:37:07.080 --> 1:37:11.480]  same place tomorrow if you can meet with him. He can explain the entire agenda,
[1:37:11.480 --> 1:37:16.520]  the move towards world government, the takeover of resources by mega
[1:37:16.520 --> 1:37:20.600]  corporations and the shadowy families that control them. All of it ties
[1:37:20.600 --> 1:37:25.080]  together. These are the people that are behind the European Union and the Euro.
[1:37:25.080 --> 1:37:28.520]  I'll meet with him, Alex. Thanks for coming. Thank you. Thank you. I'll be here
[1:37:28.520 --> 1:37:33.960]  tomorrow. You bet. George Hunt had better be here, and he'd better have the
[1:37:33.960 --> 1:37:36.360]  goods.
[1:37:38.600 --> 1:37:44.600]  Coming up, he shows up all right. The man who makes a direct link between the
[1:37:44.600 --> 1:37:52.280]  global warming scare and a plot to rule the world. Their aims are to create an
[1:37:52.280 --> 1:37:57.880]  anxiety about the ecology and global warming and so on. They're going to use
[1:37:57.880 --> 1:38:05.000]  it to take over the world. And then, Maury Strong can run to China, but can he
[1:38:05.000 --> 1:38:17.600]  hide? Jesse Ventura's investigation arrives in Beijing. Follow the money.
[1:38:17.600 --> 1:38:26.920]  Don't call my name out your window when I'm leaving. I won't even turn my head.
[1:38:26.920 --> 1:38:34.280]  Don't send your kin folks. Don't send your kin folks to give me no talking. I'll be
[1:38:34.280 --> 1:38:42.600]  gone. I'll be gone, like I said. You would say the same old thing that you've been
[1:38:42.600 --> 1:38:49.600]  saying all along. Stay there in your bed and keep your mouth shut till I'm gone.
[1:38:49.600 --> 1:38:58.560]  Don't give me that old familiar crying person, Ma. Understand, you're a man. I'm
[1:38:58.560 --> 1:39:05.560]  tired of your bad mouth. Understand, you're a man.
[1:39:05.560 --> 1:39:10.360]  Good old Johnny Cash. I'm telling you folks, true TV's going to be re-airing the
[1:39:10.360 --> 1:39:15.240]  full episode quite a bit in the next week. The next one premieres Wednesday, 10
[1:39:15.240 --> 1:39:19.800]  p.m. Eastern, 9 p.m. Central. And we're all just marveling that they're putting
[1:39:19.800 --> 1:39:25.840]  this on air. I mean, Jesse really sets out to find out the truth and finds out
[1:39:25.840 --> 1:39:31.000]  harp is manipulating the weather, finds out and confirms that the evidence shows
[1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:35.400]  9-11's an inside job, finds out that Maury Strong and the UN are running a
[1:39:35.400 --> 1:39:42.720]  global scam to steal all our money and control our lives. Next week, they expose
[1:39:42.720 --> 1:39:49.680]  RFID, face scanning cameras, Catherine Albrecht, and others are in the episode.
[1:39:49.680 --> 1:39:59.280]  And, you know, I was only one of five, six, seven consultants, but they really did
[1:39:59.280 --> 1:40:02.600]  their research and they would set out to say, we're going to see if this is true.
[1:40:02.600 --> 1:40:09.760]  And they always basically find out it is. I mean, this is a real production with
[1:40:09.760 --> 1:40:20.320]  real investigation and Ventura is for real. I mean, I know him personally and I
[1:40:20.320 --> 1:40:25.760]  just can't believe this is on air. But again, the globalist and Jesse said this
[1:40:25.760 --> 1:40:29.440]  on air, the globalist have made the decision. They haven't told us this. We
[1:40:29.440 --> 1:40:33.520]  can see it. Just have Lord Rothschild come out or David Rothschild come out or
[1:40:33.520 --> 1:40:41.960]  David Rockefeller come out or Ban Ki-moon, head of the UN or Herman von Rumpuy come
[1:40:41.960 --> 1:40:49.480]  out, head of the EU and say, we're setting up global government. And so really, I
[1:40:49.480 --> 1:40:53.440]  guess the people at Time Warner in places, they can't just deny that we've been
[1:40:53.440 --> 1:40:56.080]  telling the truth the whole time. So they're like, okay, we'll make it an
[1:40:56.080 --> 1:40:59.920]  entertainment show. We'll call it conspiracy theory and we'll just throw it
[1:40:59.920 --> 1:41:04.560]  out there. And the public so conditioned, I guess this is revelation of the method.
[1:41:04.560 --> 1:41:10.440]  It's kind of like Fox television six months before 9 11 a year before 9 11
[1:41:10.440 --> 1:41:14.920]  produced it because I've talked to the star of the show, Dean Haglin. I mean, he
[1:41:14.920 --> 1:41:19.920]  showed up at my house to tell me about this. Talk about living a conspiracy
[1:41:19.920 --> 1:41:25.960]  theory, the host of one of the stars of X files. And then, of course, the spinoff
[1:41:25.960 --> 1:41:32.360]  Sloan gunman, the main star of that show. The CIA approached Chris Carter and
[1:41:32.360 --> 1:41:37.680]  others and said, we want you to put this in your production. The government
[1:41:37.680 --> 1:41:42.840]  hijacks a jumbo jet to fly it into the World Trade Center to get martial law
[1:41:42.840 --> 1:41:48.200]  and blaming on Afghanistan to launch a new war. And the government uses a
[1:41:48.200 --> 1:41:54.320]  drill of hijacked jets to make nor add stand down so that because the rest of
[1:41:54.320 --> 1:41:57.120]  the government's not bad, they don't know. So they'll stand down and let it
[1:41:57.120 --> 1:42:03.920]  happen. And then six months after it airs, the exact same thing happens. So
[1:42:03.920 --> 1:42:06.320]  really, I think that's why this is allowed to air.
[1:42:11.520 --> 1:42:16.360]  And we're really being prepared. You know, I watched some popular culture. I
[1:42:16.360 --> 1:42:21.520]  scan it. I look at it. I've seen parts of Operation Bluebeam that have been
[1:42:21.520 --> 1:42:28.200]  declassified. And whether aliens are real or not, the United Nations, another
[1:42:28.200 --> 1:42:32.640]  big Rothschild, the federal government, all these astronauts coming out,
[1:42:32.640 --> 1:42:38.200]  moonwalkers talking about flying saucers, they are getting people ready for
[1:42:38.200 --> 1:42:41.640]  extraterrestrial life to be announced. And I don't know if it's this month or
[1:42:41.640 --> 1:42:45.680]  five years from now, but they're getting ready with that too. I just think
[1:42:45.680 --> 1:42:48.640]  they're just going to throw it all in our face. It's kind of like that Fox
[1:42:48.640 --> 1:42:52.640]  News piece yesterday where they go, yeah, the Japanese governments look at it,
[1:42:52.640 --> 1:42:56.680]  putting lithium in the water and it might be a good idea to drug everybody. We
[1:42:56.680 --> 1:43:01.960]  put fluoride in the water. We medicate you that way. You know, we put iodine
[1:43:01.960 --> 1:43:09.720]  and salt. Why not put a metal, a light metal, but it has the same effects as a
[1:43:09.720 --> 1:43:19.000]  heavy metal and brain damages you and causes obesity and low sexual drive. And
[1:43:19.000 --> 1:43:23.520]  they go, well, we just need to maybe put that in your water. I mean, we know
[1:43:23.520 --> 1:43:28.480]  there's spike in the water in the food with this. They've been caught. More
[1:43:28.480 --> 1:43:32.440]  than half the corn syrup products you eat at stores that your kids eat has
[1:43:32.440 --> 1:43:36.920]  mercury added. It's not involved in the manufacturing processes. They add, I
[1:43:36.920 --> 1:43:41.680]  mean, you know, and again, we're just trained to just sit here and take it. Oh,
[1:43:41.680 --> 1:43:45.640]  man, I'm not crazy like that. Alex Jones, you know, he gets mad that the UN
[1:43:45.640 --> 1:43:51.280]  says they're going to shut off our resources to destroy our society. I'm
[1:43:51.280 --> 1:43:54.400]  not worried about my society being destroyed and being turned into a third
[1:43:54.400 --> 1:43:59.360]  world slave. That's no big deal. Man, that guy's crap. Oh, that Alex Jones has
[1:43:59.360 --> 1:44:03.320]  read all these government textbooks and documents like eco science where they
[1:44:03.320 --> 1:44:08.440]  admit they want to and are spiking the water with sterilants and chemicals that
[1:44:08.440 --> 1:44:12.960]  brain damages. Man, that Alex Jones, he gets mad at being brain damaged. He's
[1:44:12.960 --> 1:44:19.040]  some, I mean, folks, I am normal. You are weird. If you're a new listener and you
[1:44:19.040 --> 1:44:27.800]  think I'm weird, you got the problem. You got me. If I ran up to a cop at a
[1:44:27.800 --> 1:44:31.120]  Burger King and he comes out of the bathroom and he catches me with a
[1:44:31.120 --> 1:44:35.720]  packet, putting something in his drink, and he comes over and grabs me and they
[1:44:35.720 --> 1:44:42.240]  arrest me and they test what's in the packet and it's lithium, a toxic
[1:44:42.240 --> 1:44:48.520]  metal. Am I going to go to prison for attempted murder? Because it could
[1:44:48.520 --> 1:44:54.880]  kill you. It was enough of a dose. Would I at least get, you know, a poisoning
[1:44:54.880 --> 1:45:01.120]  charge? I'd probably spend 10, 15, 20 years at present. The government admittedly
[1:45:01.120 --> 1:45:10.320]  is poisoning your water supply with over 150 chemicals. They add. They add. And we
[1:45:10.320 --> 1:45:14.200]  just sit here and take it. You know why you take it? Because you're on lithium,
[1:45:14.200 --> 1:45:18.840]  folks. You're on sodium fluoride that has the same effect. You're on mercury that
[1:45:18.840 --> 1:45:26.840]  has the same effect. Do you understand? You have been brain damaged. That's why
[1:45:26.840 --> 1:45:31.080]  all the neurological disorders are off the charts. Most of them are up 200,
[1:45:31.080 --> 1:45:37.760]  300, 400, 500. Some are up 10,000%. Now they're telling you, oh, you can get
[1:45:37.760 --> 1:45:43.320]  Alzheimer's when you're 25. They scan the brains. They're full of lithium and
[1:45:43.320 --> 1:45:50.640]  aluminum. I don't like having the opposite of a brain boost. I don't like
[1:45:50.640 --> 1:45:56.520]  people poisoning me. Now, then I'm going to your calls. It's another example of
[1:45:56.520 --> 1:46:04.120]  this. If I came to your door and said, I'd like to put cameras in your house to
[1:46:04.120 --> 1:46:09.560]  watch everything you do, you'd say, get off my porch, you nut, you'd slam the
[1:46:09.560 --> 1:46:12.680]  door on me. And if I didn't leave, you'd call the police on me or go get a
[1:46:12.680 --> 1:46:18.480]  shotgun. Google comes out four years ago and says, we've got a patent and we're
[1:46:18.480 --> 1:46:23.560]  testing it now and we're using it on people. Computers have built-in cameras
[1:46:23.560 --> 1:46:27.360]  and microphones. We're listening to everything you do in your home. If a dog
[1:46:27.360 --> 1:46:32.040]  barks, we then sell your name to distributors to send you dog food ads in
[1:46:32.040 --> 1:46:37.440]  the mail. We pop up dog food ads and dog toy ads. This was their example. And we
[1:46:37.440 --> 1:46:40.840]  know what sitcoms you're watching. But they said, don't worry, a human isn't
[1:46:40.840 --> 1:46:46.960]  listening. A computer creates a text file about all the noises in your house. And
[1:46:46.960 --> 1:46:51.220]  then, and then, and then we build a psychological algorithm. You got the
[1:46:51.220 --> 1:46:55.160]  cameras and the microphones in your house watching and listening to you. It's
[1:46:55.160 --> 1:47:00.400]  like I told people in 1996, 12 years ago, 13 years ago, like where is my cell
[1:47:00.400 --> 1:47:04.840]  phone? But I had that. Somebody bring me a cell phone. I just want to show
[1:47:04.840 --> 1:47:10.200]  people. I mean, it's on record that the government designed them by law where
[1:47:10.200 --> 1:47:13.960]  the manufacturers make them, where even when the phone's off, they can dial in
[1:47:13.960 --> 1:47:18.040]  and listen to you and track your location. And I'd be called a cook. I'd be
[1:47:18.040 --> 1:47:22.360]  called a nut. I'd be called an idiot. When I had the documents, now it's all
[1:47:22.360 --> 1:47:25.920]  over the news, but they tell you how good it is. You're having it introduced to
[1:47:25.920 --> 1:47:31.440]  you that you're a slave and your property of the system and that this is just
[1:47:31.440 --> 1:47:35.640]  the way it is. Yeah, we got face scanning cameras tracking you everywhere. Yeah,
[1:47:35.640 --> 1:47:41.720]  we got license plate readers tracking you. I'd tell people that 14 years ago and
[1:47:41.720 --> 1:47:48.960]  get laughed at. You better stop laughing. If you think it's funny that the entire
[1:47:48.960 --> 1:47:55.920]  society is being geared to surveil and control and track you and know who you
[1:47:55.920 --> 1:47:59.440]  really are. You think you're trying to get a job as a cop or something and they
[1:47:59.440 --> 1:48:04.000]  give you some 600 question psychological meant to catch you in lies. You think
[1:48:04.000 --> 1:48:07.200]  that's a detailed psychological. How about the millions of choices you make a
[1:48:07.200 --> 1:48:11.840]  year playing Xbox and PlayStation interactive tied into those big
[1:48:11.840 --> 1:48:16.560]  computer hubs in the group gaming? What about all your cell phone calls and what
[1:48:16.560 --> 1:48:21.240]  you visit? What about all the websites you go to? What about the digital cable
[1:48:21.240 --> 1:48:25.720]  and Tivo tracking everything you watch, everything you do on record for at least
[1:48:25.720 --> 1:48:30.480]  eight years chronicling it? I would tell people, because I was told this by a
[1:48:30.480 --> 1:48:35.520]  Time Warner technician who was a fan at my house over 10 years ago. He said,
[1:48:35.520 --> 1:48:39.240]  let me show you the manual. He said, this has got a microphone. This is a two way
[1:48:39.240 --> 1:48:42.520]  cable. Everything you're doing is being recorded. And if they want, they can
[1:48:42.520 --> 1:48:49.440]  activate that microphone. And I had people call in and threaten me on air on
[1:48:49.440 --> 1:48:56.720]  my access TV show on Time Warner in Austin. I had Time Warner during
[1:48:56.720 --> 1:49:00.920]  those casts would just cut my show off. And then I talked to people at
[1:49:00.920 --> 1:49:05.320]  Playback who were there when they would get calls at mission at Playback
[1:49:05.320 --> 1:49:10.600]  Control saying, turn that live show off. See, they didn't want you to know in
[1:49:10.600 --> 1:49:16.080]  1997 or 98, man, time flies, that everything was being watched and
[1:49:16.080 --> 1:49:21.280]  tracked. Now they just go, yeah, mm-hmm. Oh, yeah, everything. See folks, it's
[1:49:21.280 --> 1:49:26.280]  total control. So see, that's why they don't care of Alex Jones and Jesse
[1:49:26.280 --> 1:49:31.080]  Ventura. Go on television and tell you something because they think you're
[1:49:31.080 --> 1:49:35.600]  chumps. They think you're a joke. They think you're idiots. They know it's
[1:49:35.600 --> 1:49:41.320]  known that they're putting stuff in the water because you're drugged and the
[1:49:41.320 --> 1:49:44.520]  evidence is they're now increasing the amount of drugs they're putting in the
[1:49:44.520 --> 1:49:50.480]  water. They're doing psychological tests. They're increasing the drugs and
[1:49:50.480 --> 1:49:55.560]  making the announcements of what they're doing. You're being drugged with toxic
[1:49:55.560 --> 1:50:00.760]  chemicals. Do you like it? Do you enjoy it? Can't you intellectually, even if you
[1:50:00.760 --> 1:50:06.520]  emotionally can't get angry at this, can't you intellectually stop drinking
[1:50:06.520 --> 1:50:11.240]  tap water, stop eating the highly processed foods with corn syrup? Don't
[1:50:11.240 --> 1:50:15.640]  you care enough to stop giving your kids Coca-Cola and all the stuff that's
[1:50:15.640 --> 1:50:21.800]  hurting them? But no, see, you're at ease from the lithium and fluoride. You're
[1:50:21.800 --> 1:50:26.120]  like, yeah, I understand you're saying I'm being poisoned, but give me a Coke
[1:50:26.120 --> 1:50:31.400]  with fluoride. Give me a Coke with mercury. Give me that Coke with corn
[1:50:31.400 --> 1:50:35.720]  syrup that has the mercury in it. Give me a Pepsi. Give me an Aspartame bubble
[1:50:35.720 --> 1:50:39.840]  gum. I just, I understand Alex, you're telling me they're hurting me, but I just,
[1:50:39.840 --> 1:50:45.800]  I just don't care because not only are you been drugged, you've been programmed
[1:50:45.800 --> 1:50:50.600]  by TV and all the messages to lay down, to be at ease, that everything's
[1:50:50.600 --> 1:50:55.160]  entertainment, that everything's fine, that everything's fun. We're gonna come
[1:50:55.160 --> 1:50:58.440]  back, go to your phone calls and cover news for a full hour, and we've got two
[1:50:58.440 --> 1:51:03.200]  guests joining us from Copenhagen. You may be new to FreezeDry Foods. You may

[1:53:59.160 --> 1:54:10.000]  All right, William F. Jasper of the New American magazine will be joining us from
[1:54:10.000 --> 1:54:20.280]  Copenhagen, as well as Alex Newman. So we look forward to having both those
[1:54:20.280 --> 1:54:26.640]  gentlemen on together. I'm about to go to your phone calls. I do just want to
[1:54:26.640 --> 1:54:31.760]  throw out to the listeners. Yesterday was the final day to get your orders in
[1:54:31.760 --> 1:54:37.840]  and to be guaranteed via UPS to get it delivered before Christmas. T-shirts,
[1:54:37.840 --> 1:54:42.800]  books, films, everything we have to offer in the effort against the New World Order
[1:54:42.800 --> 1:54:51.560]  at infowars.com and the online video bookstore slash Patriot Gear area. But
[1:54:51.560 --> 1:54:57.480]  most areas of the country take two or three or four days and so it's not
[1:54:57.480 --> 1:55:02.000]  guaranteed. Some areas with UPS only around Christmas do they say it takes
[1:55:02.000 --> 1:55:06.520]  six days. Most places it's two, three, four days. When it's non-Christmas it's
[1:55:06.520 --> 1:55:11.400]  guaranteed four days the way we ship it. But the point is get your orders in
[1:55:11.400 --> 1:55:17.680]  today to get fall of the Republic and a free t-shirt of your choice. An Obama
[1:55:17.680 --> 1:55:24.400]  Joker shirt, a join or die, don't try it on me shirts, all available free with
[1:55:24.400 --> 1:55:28.680]  fall of the Republic, a bunch of other combos, a bunch of other specials for a
[1:55:28.680 --> 1:55:34.920]  limited time. When the Obamas run out, I'm going to get rid of the free t-shirt
[1:55:34.920 --> 1:55:40.560]  deal, okay? And they are running out. The sizes we've run out of, I added some
[1:55:40.560 --> 1:55:44.320]  other variants, varieties of t-shirts that you can get so everybody can take
[1:55:44.320 --> 1:55:47.840]  advantage of it. We have some other deals where you can get fall of the
[1:55:47.840 --> 1:55:52.960]  Republic and get reflections and warnings with Aaron Russo free. I just
[1:55:52.960 --> 1:55:56.480]  want fall of the Republic in people's hands. You may know all about the New
[1:55:56.480 --> 1:56:00.000]  World Order. You probably know more than I do. Does your neighbor, to your friends,
[1:56:00.000 --> 1:56:04.920]  to your family, can you present it as well as this film? Probably not. I know I
[1:56:04.920 --> 1:56:08.080]  couldn't present this information as good as I could in the film because I
[1:56:08.080 --> 1:56:13.200]  crafted this. I mean my wife saw this and said this blows all your other films
[1:56:13.200 --> 1:56:18.560]  away. It really does. The information, the production quality, people are ready to
[1:56:18.560 --> 1:56:24.040]  wake up, fall of the Republic. You can also get big deals with in-game, Obama
[1:56:24.040 --> 1:56:27.800]  deception, Camp FEMA, a bunch of other books and videos that I produced and that
[1:56:27.800 --> 1:56:38.320]  we also carry. Infowars.com or 888-253-3139. And coming up, UN chief, we will
[1:56:38.320 --> 1:56:42.640]  impose global governance. He gave an LA Times interview and said it again. He
[1:56:42.640 --> 1:56:48.440]  said we will impose whether you like it or not. And we got Rothschild on TV
[1:56:48.440 --> 1:56:51.560]  talking about how they're going to force it. I mean, these are dictators folks and
[1:56:51.560 --> 1:56:54.880]  they must be resistant. All right. I'm going to start taking calls. Julio in
[1:56:54.880 --> 1:56:59.440]  Illinois. Then Eric Virgil Allison, Jeff and others. Go ahead. You're on the
[1:56:59.440 --> 1:57:04.040]  air, Julio. Alex Jones, Freedom Fighter. How are you this afternoon? Good, my friend.
[1:57:04.040 --> 1:57:07.800]  What's on your mind? Well, it's a beautiful day here in Macomb, Illinois.
[1:57:07.800 --> 1:57:12.840]  sunny skies and beautiful chemtrails circling through our beautiful city.
[1:57:12.840 --> 1:57:18.280]  Great day. Well, the brain damage will help us all feel better and submit. Oh,
[1:57:18.280 --> 1:57:24.440]  and the tap water is nothing more than mercury deliciousness. You're a good
[1:57:24.440 --> 1:57:29.800]  American. Kidding aside, I don't want to be one of those right-wing terrorists.
[1:57:29.800 --> 1:57:33.720]  I believe in that. No, but if you say I love tyranny, I love brain damaging my
[1:57:33.720 --> 1:57:37.480]  children with chemical weapons in the food and water, then I like Sean Hannity
[1:57:37.480 --> 1:57:42.320]  say you're a great American. Well, I'll comment about the show and then a quick
[1:57:42.320 --> 1:57:45.800]  question. Our conspiracy theory watching it last night with my friends. We still
[1:57:45.800 --> 1:57:49.200]  can't believe that it's on TV. To me, it's one of the greatest shows of all
[1:57:49.200 --> 1:57:53.040]  time. Yeah, but it's rather than anything that's out there right now. It's
[1:57:53.040 --> 1:57:58.640]  better than V or loss or all those stupid other network. They aren't real. Let me
[1:57:58.640 --> 1:58:01.880]  just add this point and I'll come back to you. If you want to finish, Julio,
[1:58:01.880 --> 1:58:06.680]  we'll go to everybody else. This is a key point before I forget it. In October of
[1:58:06.680 --> 1:58:11.480]  last year, Jesse came down for three days and hung out with me and I picked his
[1:58:11.480 --> 1:58:15.400]  brain. He picked my brain. I mean, we had dinner a bunch of times, drove around to
[1:58:15.400 --> 1:58:20.480]  the Hill Country, hung out with Willie Nelson and he was pitching this show and
[1:58:20.480 --> 1:58:26.520]  he said, I will not do it if I don't control it. And so I immediately wanted
[1:58:26.520 --> 1:58:31.280]  to be involved because even if it ever aired, it would be groundbreaking and I
[1:58:31.280 --> 1:58:36.800]  love the trailblaze. And I'm playing second or third fiddle on this show, but
[1:58:36.800 --> 1:58:39.880]  I'm the only second or third fiddle and this is very exciting.

[1:58:50.480 --> 1:58:55.000]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they

[1:59:50.000 --> 1:59:57.000]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:00:05.520 --> 2:00:12.440]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[2:00:12.440 --> 2:00:19.440]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[2:00:20.800 --> 2:00:25.760]  Alex Jones. Okay, Julio, then Eric, Allison, Jeff and others were going to your
[2:00:25.760 --> 2:00:28.960]  calls right now. Julio, finish up your point.
[2:00:28.960 --> 2:00:34.200]  Yeah, so conspiracy theory, unbelievable show. It gets people to understand what's
[2:00:34.200 --> 2:00:38.200]  really going on in the world and understand the names. It's always strong. I
[2:00:38.200 --> 2:00:41.320]  learned from the show that he was an oil tycoon, which makes him a greater
[2:00:41.320 --> 2:00:47.000]  scam than he already is. So is Al Gore. Al Gore is the majority owner of
[2:00:47.000 --> 2:00:51.320]  Occidental Petroleum, and his companies are the most vicious cutting down rain
[2:00:51.320 --> 2:00:56.600]  forest. See, it's like Prince Bernhard got caught under the Wall-Wall-I-Fun
[2:00:56.600 --> 2:01:01.520]  hunting elephants and selling their tusk in a huge industrial op. They're the
[2:01:01.520 --> 2:01:05.160]  exact opposite of what they claim to be. Do you understand?
[2:01:05.160 --> 2:01:10.440]  To my question, Alex, do you think you're talking about them using another false
[2:01:10.440 --> 2:01:14.560]  flag attack on the country? If Copenhagen, if we don't pass it here in this country
[2:01:14.560 --> 2:01:18.560]  through our Senate, or if the catastrophe continues down in Copenhagen with all
[2:01:18.560 --> 2:01:22.480]  those world-discussing leaders, there's a report. I was wondering if you could take
[2:01:22.480 --> 2:01:25.720]  a look at it through starpage.com, the greatest search engine of all time,
[2:01:25.720 --> 2:01:31.000]  August 1996 from the Air Force, a weather-as-a-force multiplier, owning
[2:01:31.000 --> 2:01:33.680]  weather in 25... Yeah, no, I've covered that many times, Jim.
[2:01:33.680 --> 2:01:37.680]  Yeah, it's pretty disgusting. I think this could be it, because it says in that
[2:01:37.680 --> 2:01:41.920]  document, the public will not know whether or not it's an attack from the
[2:01:41.920 --> 2:01:45.840]  government or it's a natural occurrence. Yeah, no, we need to pull that
[2:01:45.840 --> 2:01:49.760]  report up, and I appreciate your call. What you're getting at is this, and yes,
[2:01:49.760 --> 2:01:54.640]  they can create hurricanes. They can weaken them. They can strengthen them. They
[2:01:54.640 --> 2:01:59.400]  can kill them. They can create other weather systems for more than 50 years.
[2:01:59.400 --> 2:02:07.000]  It's very advanced now. It's declassified in China and Europe. There's UN treaties
[2:02:07.000 --> 2:02:14.440]  from the 70s, and yes, the globalists want to play God. They're introducing you
[2:02:14.440 --> 2:02:18.960]  got to be scared of the environment. No doubt they are capable of staging
[2:02:18.960 --> 2:02:26.200]  environmental crises, a false flag weather event, to then sell global warming.
[2:02:26.200 --> 2:02:31.200]  That's actually coming up in fall of the Republic too, but I haven't named the
[2:02:31.200 --> 2:02:36.320]  main name of it yet, but that's what it's all about. The eugenics, the master plan,
[2:02:36.320 --> 2:02:41.760]  and what they are going to launch. And certainly, that is a very important point,
[2:02:41.760 --> 2:02:48.440]  Julio, owning the weather in 2025. Let's go. They already owned it 20 years before
[2:02:48.440 --> 2:02:55.000]  that. Let's go ahead and talk to Eric in California. Go ahead, Eric. Alex, it's
[2:02:55.000 --> 2:02:59.000]  great to be on your show again. It's been a while. I've got a lot to report.
[2:02:59.000 --> 2:03:05.440]  First off, I'd like to thank Julio for his chemtrail report from Illinois.
[2:03:05.440 --> 2:03:13.840]  Currently, here in Southern California, I'm watching four jets laying down the
[2:03:13.840 --> 2:03:21.920]  aerosol of love, and I would like to talk to Allison and Jeff who are on hold and
[2:03:21.920 --> 2:03:26.960]  get a report from them. It seems like they have teams of these working
[2:03:26.960 --> 2:03:30.440]  throughout the United States, and it's like, you know, when they're when they're
[2:03:30.440 --> 2:03:33.240]  spraying here, they've got to be spraying somewhere else.
[2:03:33.240 --> 2:03:42.680]  Yeah. Well, the airwatch group, yeah, the California Skywatch now has groups all over
[2:03:42.680 --> 2:03:47.560]  the world, and they are chronicling that. And I appreciate your call. The only issue
[2:03:47.560 --> 2:03:51.800]  with chemtrails is people just calling and say, I see them spring. Next caller, I
[2:03:51.800 --> 2:03:56.000]  see them spring. This plane's at 5,000 feet, laying down giant trails that never
[2:03:56.000 --> 2:04:02.000]  dissipate. I see them spring. Instead of teams reading the writings of the White
[2:04:02.000 --> 2:04:07.720]  House science are and the Nobel Prize winner from the early 90s who came up
[2:04:07.720 --> 2:04:12.560]  with the plan of chemtrails. See, no one's out educating others about the
[2:04:12.560 --> 2:04:17.880]  source documents of the weather modification program. That's why Julio's
[2:04:17.880 --> 2:04:21.560]  call was good, though he called last week with the same information about
[2:04:21.560 --> 2:04:31.400]  owning the weather in 2025. Or you could talk about Army Times, April 27th or 28th,
[2:04:31.400 --> 2:04:38.200]  1997 sec death. William Cohen says, yes, we control the weather. We can create
[2:04:38.200 --> 2:04:43.000]  earthquakes and tsunamis. I mean, I'm not the one saying that. He's the one
[2:04:43.000 --> 2:04:50.360]  saying it. So yes, yes, we need to educate people that the government just
[2:04:50.360 --> 2:04:58.800]  quietly just let it slip out. Like a burping church that yeah, we're spraying
[2:04:58.800 --> 2:05:01.920]  gas for your own good. Now don't worry about it. This is Alex Jones and I want to
[2:05:01.920 --> 2:05:05.440]  tell you about the Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure
[2:05:05.440 --> 2:05:08.840]  drinking water right from the humidity in the air. No, this isn't science fiction.
[2:05:08.840 --> 2:05:12.120]  It's very real. I know because I use one every day in my own home and it's
[2:05:12.120 --> 2:05:15.520]  available right now to you because you know exactly where your water comes
[2:05:15.520 --> 2:05:19.240]  from with Acola Blue. You'll know what's in your cup. Clean, great tasting water

[2:06:01.920 --> 2:06:05.920]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator. Number one, new
[2:06:05.920 --> 2:06:09.720]  climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two,
[2:06:09.720 --> 2:06:13.800]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[2:06:13.800 --> 2:06:18.040]  allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in the
[2:06:18.040 --> 2:06:22.320]  name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the
[2:06:22.320 --> 2:06:26.280]  country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded. And now, new socialist
[2:06:26.280 --> 2:06:30.640]  legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is
[2:06:30.640 --> 2:06:34.400]  always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their
[2:06:34.400 --> 2:06:38.520]  power from weather-related onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides
[2:06:38.520 --> 2:06:42.360]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar
[2:06:42.360 --> 2:06:45.240]  power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my old
[2:06:45.240 --> 2:06:50.520]  sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's

[2:07:01.320 --> 2:07:05.080]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs
[2:07:05.080 --> 2:07:09.800]  Generator. Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the
[2:07:09.800 --> 2:07:13.720]  solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the
[2:07:13.720 --> 2:07:17.560]  lungs. The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne
[2:07:17.560 --> 2:07:22.560]  pathogens and viruses. The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system
[2:07:22.560 --> 2:07:27.840]  with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver
[2:07:27.840 --> 2:07:32.440]  nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream. With continued legislation
[2:07:32.440 --> 2:07:36.640]  threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and
[2:07:36.640 --> 2:07:41.600]  endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator. Very easy to follow,

[2:08:06.120 --> 2:08:13.120]  because there's a war on for your mind. I'm gonna go to Allison, Jeff, Kevin and
[2:08:13.120 --> 2:08:16.720]  Chris here in just a moment. The toll-free number to join us on this live
[2:08:16.720 --> 2:08:25.680]  Thursday the 17th day of December 2009 edition is 1-800-259-9231.
[2:08:26.320 --> 2:08:31.320]  Here's some of the news coming up at the bottom of the hour. Left rebels against
[2:08:31.320 --> 2:08:35.120]  health reform. They're now getting a chance to read that it cuts all their
[2:08:35.120 --> 2:08:43.120]  health care. Oh you got to love it. Such a scam. Just everything goes to the banks.
[2:08:43.120 --> 2:08:48.880]  Senate panel approves Bernanke nomination. That's bad news. Nancy Pelosi says
[2:08:48.880 --> 2:08:55.720]  climate change summit will create jobs. I guess for bureaucrats, yeah. Predator
[2:08:55.720 --> 2:09:03.720]  drones hacked in Iraq operations. Yeah, hacked. Climate deal on ships and planes
[2:09:03.720 --> 2:09:11.640]  seen slipping away. Oh the global tax on that's in trouble right now. And I want
[2:09:11.640 --> 2:09:15.000]  to get back into Rothschild says that people are fighting against global
[2:09:15.000 --> 2:09:18.640]  governance agenda. But the first thing I want to cover is this. Then I'm going to
[2:09:18.640 --> 2:09:26.560]  your calls. I got on air as kind of a mainline conservative leaning libertarian
[2:09:26.560 --> 2:09:33.400]  14 years ago. I was aware of the Federal Reserve being private and of the global
[2:09:33.400 --> 2:09:37.960]  list agenda. But I, you know, I was kind of like a mainline Ron Paul supporter.
[2:09:39.480 --> 2:09:43.640]  Started doing a TV show locally on access. I thought I got to get on air. I got
[2:09:43.640 --> 2:09:49.280]  to warn people mainly for second amendment issues. And suddenly old people
[2:09:49.280 --> 2:09:54.520]  were calling me that had code enforcers stealing their stuff. And I found out
[2:09:54.760 --> 2:09:59.560]  that the health department, the eugenics department was set up for eugenics over
[2:09:59.560 --> 2:10:04.440]  100 years ago worldwide. Remember I told you they take your baby's blood at
[2:10:04.440 --> 2:10:08.720]  birth for 37 years. Now that's declassified through the health department,
[2:10:08.720 --> 2:10:13.480]  which is really an international arm that they had databases with hospitals.
[2:10:13.680 --> 2:10:17.240]  And then hospital nurse just thought they were entering into a database. This
[2:10:17.240 --> 2:10:22.240]  was even in the mid 90s. And it was handwritten reports that were later
[2:10:22.240 --> 2:10:28.280]  filed then. They just thought, Oh, is this old person at risk? So they weren't
[2:10:28.280 --> 2:10:32.520]  part of it. See, you don't know you're part of it. And if you'd had a heart
[2:10:32.520 --> 2:10:37.720]  attack or have cancer, government, people in the city of Austin would go
[2:10:37.720 --> 2:10:43.040]  through a database and they would find out if you were, couldn't stand up for
[2:10:43.040 --> 2:10:48.080]  yourself. And they do searches and find out if you had family. And then, and if
[2:10:48.080 --> 2:10:55.960]  you live saying a house that was valued at $400,000 on West 37th or whatever,
[2:10:55.960 --> 2:11:02.800]  they would come out and start giving you $2,000 fines a week for a dead spot of
[2:11:02.800 --> 2:11:06.480]  grass. I mean, some of these houses I went to were really nice and they'd call
[2:11:06.480 --> 2:11:10.240]  up and go, young man, help me. I've called the police and judges and they won't
[2:11:10.240 --> 2:11:14.080]  help me. And then I said, I wasn't going to pay it. And the police came and
[2:11:14.080 --> 2:11:20.440]  beat me up. And then they have special units of police that help with this.
[2:11:20.440 --> 2:11:24.640]  And, you know, it came out in DC. They have units of police with records that
[2:11:24.640 --> 2:11:28.640]  steal cars, even legally parked and take them to a chop shop. And I mean, I've
[2:11:28.640 --> 2:11:32.400]  seen thousands of articles about this since then. And once a week or so, I
[2:11:32.400 --> 2:11:38.280]  like to zoom in on one, but they were working with realtors and key health
[2:11:38.280 --> 2:11:44.360]  department and city officials. And they would run up a big debt, didn't say
[2:11:44.360 --> 2:11:52.360]  we're going to foreclose on your house. And I mean, millions of dollars were
[2:11:52.360 --> 2:11:57.800]  being made a week off of this, just robbing old people, mainly. Then they
[2:11:57.800 --> 2:12:01.800]  targeted my grandparents in Austin. My grandfather's now dead. The strange
[2:12:01.800 --> 2:12:06.520]  twist of fate was I'd already been in their neighborhood, which was lower,
[2:12:06.520 --> 2:12:11.200]  you know, middle class, kind of working class area in South Austin. It's since
[2:12:11.200 --> 2:12:15.120]  gentrified a bit, but working class area. And I'd been around their neighborhood
[2:12:15.120 --> 2:12:22.340]  a few times near this area of Austin where I sit. And it was always, I'd go
[2:12:22.340 --> 2:12:25.320]  to somebody's door and the old guy would have had a heart attack. Their little
[2:12:25.320 --> 2:12:29.560]  elderly wife would be like, they say because there were some boards in the
[2:12:29.560 --> 2:12:35.040]  back on the grass that, uh, that they're going to take the house and I've got
[2:12:35.040 --> 2:12:40.800]  this last month, the bills and I don't have $14,000 and, and the city won't
[2:12:40.800 --> 2:12:46.560]  help me. And that inspector came and threatened me. And ma'am, when did this
[2:12:46.560 --> 2:12:52.120]  happen? One week after Bill got back after his heart attack and I'd survived
[2:12:52.120 --> 2:12:58.600]  cancer and they told me elder care said, I'll just move in a nursing home. Well,
[2:12:58.600 --> 2:13:03.960]  then with my grandparents, there was this city gutter about 15 feet behind
[2:13:03.960 --> 2:13:08.920]  their little backyard, not on their property. And they showed up and they
[2:13:08.920 --> 2:13:13.560]  said, we're going to give you $2,000 a week fines until you clean out all the
[2:13:14.720 --> 2:13:19.880]  lumber and, and, and jump from years that had flown off the major street into
[2:13:19.880 --> 2:13:24.120]  there. And I've been, and my grandfather got back there in the summer,
[2:13:24.120 --> 2:13:27.720]  cleaned it all out. I found out once he had the heart attack and I showed up
[2:13:27.720 --> 2:13:30.920]  out there and, and, and found out the whole story. And then I thought him
[2:13:30.920 --> 2:13:35.120]  off and my dad had to send him, you know, the letter for where their property
[2:13:35.120 --> 2:13:39.200]  line was. But the point is they're just viciously feeding on people and
[2:13:39.200 --> 2:13:43.640]  they're everywhere. Now under the whole green movement, they're going to
[2:13:43.640 --> 2:13:49.560]  increase this 20, 30 fold. I mean, it's literally that. I mean, it's
[2:13:49.560 --> 2:13:59.800]  unbelievable. This is out of Philly.com. This is the Philadelphia Daily News.
[2:14:00.720 --> 2:14:03.480]  And there's now a city investigation. It looks like it's in all the major
[2:14:03.480 --> 2:14:08.640]  departments, but the home inspectors and city inspectors and code enforcers
[2:14:09.200 --> 2:14:14.240]  acted as a group of bandits robbing people, kicking old people out, stealing
[2:14:14.240 --> 2:14:21.040]  all their property, robbing homes, threatening people for cash payoffs. And
[2:14:21.080 --> 2:14:28.160]  I've seen this in England. It's all the same. And as Americans are as brits,
[2:14:28.160 --> 2:14:31.880]  when a bureaucrat shows up, we just wet ourselves. You're from the government.
[2:14:32.120 --> 2:14:39.560]  That means I serve you. You are my God. What can I do? What can I do? I just,
[2:14:39.560 --> 2:14:45.520]  I'm scared of you. You're my God. I'm a coward. America's about worshiping you.
[2:14:45.520 --> 2:14:49.640]  I see all the TV ads and billboards that you are my God. And these people just
[2:14:49.960 --> 2:14:54.920]  waddle in and stealing houses, stealing goods, kicking people out, and they
[2:14:54.920 --> 2:14:59.480]  can deals to sell their houses. Big to tell report. And they just do it here
[2:14:59.480 --> 2:15:03.760]  in Austin every day. And a poor family goes in to have a little kid.
[2:15:04.120 --> 2:15:08.920]  Baby's blonde haired blue eyes. They got a $400,000 bounty on them. They walk
[2:15:08.920 --> 2:15:12.800]  in, cops grab the women by the neck and start choking them till they sign the
[2:15:12.800 --> 2:15:17.040]  kid over. I have walked into a hospital room as the cop has his hands around
[2:15:17.040 --> 2:15:20.640]  her neck and goes, get out of here. Get out of here. It happened to Mike
[2:15:20.640 --> 2:15:25.240]  Hansen too. We even have footage of some of it. I mean, I have seen the hell. I
[2:15:25.240 --> 2:15:29.360]  have seen the torture. I have seen the evil just everywhere, breeding, like
[2:15:29.360 --> 2:15:37.440]  cess rising. Someone's got to stop them. Someone's got to stand up against
[2:15:37.440 --> 2:15:44.840]  them. City workers who were assigned to clean up blight northeast Philadelphia
[2:15:44.840 --> 2:15:54.160]  instead acted like a band of bandits by illegally entering homes and ransacking
[2:15:54.160 --> 2:15:59.280]  them of cash, jewelry, TVs and guns. Yeah, they would confiscate people's
[2:15:59.280 --> 2:16:04.400]  guns too. I can arrest you for this. Ah, mine, even though the guns were
[2:16:04.400 --> 2:16:09.640]  legal. There's a attorney went on to say and it just talked about how they were
[2:16:09.640 --> 2:16:15.080]  robbing everybody and just, it's just unbelievable. And just taking homes and
[2:16:15.080 --> 2:16:19.640]  just whatever they want. And if you ever resisted them, they just get on their
[2:16:19.640 --> 2:16:24.480]  phone and go, I was just assaulted and the SWAT team rolls up and you come out
[2:16:24.480 --> 2:16:28.560]  or you die and they're just like, Oh, this country's ours. Lock and load. Oh,
[2:16:28.560 --> 2:16:33.000]  it feels so good to be a tyrant. I've said enough. Let's go ahead and talk to
[2:16:33.000 --> 2:16:38.640]  Allison in California. Allison, you're on the air. Go ahead. Hello, Alex. I'm
[2:16:38.640 --> 2:16:43.760]  calling you to hopefully appeal to your trailblazing side. I wish to tell you
[2:16:43.760 --> 2:16:49.400]  up information regarding a state of the art influence technology that's having
[2:16:49.400 --> 2:16:55.280]  a experiment take place on a global level. It's for the grassroots campaign. We
[2:16:55.280 --> 2:16:58.600]  want your listeners and you to pay attention to this because it's an
[2:16:58.600 --> 2:17:05.920]  antithesis to everything that your show is about. It is a fire burn, fire burn
[2:17:05.920 --> 2:17:11.400]  doctors alert. It is a means of demonstrating proof to the public and
[2:17:11.400 --> 2:17:16.760]  to anybody who participates in this of this influence technology. And it's a
[2:17:16.760 --> 2:17:20.680]  very simple experiment and it's demonstrated on fire burns on burns
[2:17:20.680 --> 2:17:25.360]  that happen regularly in people's homes on terrorist bombings. It could be
[2:17:25.360 --> 2:17:30.680]  troops in Afghanistan explain it to me. What people need to do is give their
[2:17:30.680 --> 2:17:34.000]  name, the date of birth, their place of birth, and if possible a picture on a
[2:17:34.000 --> 2:17:39.480]  camera cell phone to 818-333-6444. Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am. You
[2:17:39.480 --> 2:17:44.600]  got to tell me what this is. You talk about influence technologies. You start
[2:17:44.600 --> 2:17:50.160]  talking about burns. That makes explain to me what you're saying first. Well,
[2:17:50.160 --> 2:17:54.520]  this is an experiment to demonstrate proof of the effectiveness of this
[2:17:54.520 --> 2:17:59.960]  influence technology. And it's for the public to call in that number, the 818-333-6455.
[2:17:59.960 --> 2:18:05.520]  Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am. Put her on hold. Ma'am, I, listen, you can't
[2:18:05.520 --> 2:18:10.640]  just call in and give your phone number out. I mean, it could be, I don't think
[2:18:10.640 --> 2:18:13.360]  you're doing this, but we've had this happen before. You could be given your
[2:18:13.360 --> 2:18:18.120]  ex-husband's number out you don't like. Okay? And then, and then, and then we get
[2:18:18.120 --> 2:18:21.920]  threatened with lawsuits. So number one, I don't like people giving their full name
[2:18:21.920 --> 2:18:26.560]  if I don't know who they are and I can't prove it. You know, I'm Bill Johnson and
[2:18:26.560 --> 2:18:30.920]  I'm going to do this to judge Billy Bob. You can't do that. You can't call in and
[2:18:30.920 --> 2:18:35.560]  give phone numbers out. I'm a little more lenient with 1-800s because those
[2:18:35.560 --> 2:18:41.360]  generally aren't going to be some private person's number. Okay? I know for at
[2:18:41.360 --> 2:18:46.360]  least 20 years, shopping malls and casinos have ultra low audio under the
[2:18:46.360 --> 2:18:50.600]  music telling you buy, buy, relax. Everything's great. Everything's good.
[2:18:50.600 --> 2:18:56.560]  Casinos do pump oxygen in. I know that in the 50s they had ads for Coca-Cola
[2:18:56.560 --> 2:19:01.320]  flashing an image of a desert and it doubled Coke sales. I know there's
[2:19:01.320 --> 2:19:07.640]  subliminals. They teach it in basic advertising. I know that there's all
[2:19:07.640 --> 2:19:12.160]  sorts of mind control systems being deployed. Okay? There's a lot of it
[2:19:12.160 --> 2:19:18.120]  going on, but just to call in and say, people can call this number and demonstrate
[2:19:18.120 --> 2:19:23.480]  something. You have to tell me what this is first. Okay? You have to explain to me
[2:19:23.480 --> 2:19:28.320]  what the test is, what the group is, what this phone number is that you're going
[2:19:28.320 --> 2:19:32.800]  to give out. Okay? You're talking about my trailblazing spirit. I trailblaze what I
[2:19:32.800 --> 2:19:36.720]  can prove. Okay? And I can't get people to wake up to that. So I'll see what you
[2:19:36.720 --> 2:19:40.680]  have to say, Allison. When we come back briefly, if you can just refrain from
[2:19:40.680 --> 2:19:43.920]  giving the phone number out for a minute to answer my question. Then we'll talk
[2:19:43.920 --> 2:19:48.480]  to Jeff, Kevin, Chris, and Mark. I'm trying to hurry through your calls, but

[2:19:51.960 --> 2:19:55.440]  latest on the government takeover of health care and what's happening in
[2:19:55.440 --> 2:19:58.920]  Copenhagen, Denmark. Schwarzenegger is agenda to take over your town in
[2:19:58.920 --> 2:20:03.280]  city. He needs to be arrested. Studies have shown that many people do not get
[2:20:03.280 --> 2:20:06.720]  the proper vitamins and minerals necessary to maintain good health with
[2:20:06.720 --> 2:20:10.840]  so many places to choose from deciding where and what to buy can be a lengthy

[2:21:02.200 --> 2:21:06.880]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our
[2:21:06.880 --> 2:21:12.040]  last chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll
[2:21:12.040 --> 2:21:15.400]  be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home. I've turned a
[2:21:15.400 --> 2:21:20.200]  tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are calling the
[2:21:20.200 --> 2:21:25.320]  shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[2:21:25.320 --> 2:21:29.360]  attention. Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the
[2:21:29.360 --> 2:21:34.560]  criminal offshore cartel, hell bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes
[2:21:34.560 --> 2:21:38.200]  constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[2:21:38.200 --> 2:21:41.720]  They're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the
[2:21:41.720 --> 2:21:46.960]  checkout to? Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington DC, we
[2:21:46.960 --> 2:21:52.640]  have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD
[2:21:52.640 --> 2:21:58.000]  at infowars.com. We're watching online right now in super high quality at
[2:21:58.000 --> 2:22:03.320]  prisonplanet.tv. Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be
[2:22:03.320 --> 2:22:07.600]  the guardians of currency to ensure purity, content, weights, and measures of
[2:22:07.600 --> 2:22:11.600]  gold and silver coin citizens would use for commerce. This reinstalled
[2:22:11.600 --> 2:22:16.160]  confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system. Wisdom being lost
[2:22:16.160 --> 2:22:20.040]  with time, the government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit
[2:22:20.040 --> 2:22:24.000]  has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting
[2:22:24.000 --> 2:22:28.600]  scheme our country ever experienced. This is not only a transfer of power to an
[2:22:28.600 --> 2:22:32.440]  institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused
[2:22:32.440 --> 2:22:36.680]  the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value. Now foreign governments
[2:22:36.680 --> 2:22:41.080]  are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency. Hi, this is
[2:22:41.080 --> 2:22:45.200]  Ted Anderson. I'm offering a book that explains how the system works. Call me
[2:22:45.200 --> 2:22:51.560]  today at 800-686-2237. I will give you a silver dollar free just for purchasing

[2:24:23.640 --> 2:24:34.320]  Okay, is Allison still there? Allison, can you tell me specifically what this test is?
[2:24:34.320 --> 2:24:39.600]  It's about getting proof to the public of our groundbreaking influence
[2:24:39.600 --> 2:24:44.760]  technology which helps people. It heals burns in minutes, it stops pain in
[2:24:44.760 --> 2:24:48.960]  minutes, and it's proving to the public once and for all by passing the
[2:24:48.960 --> 2:24:53.560]  systems that have blocked this for decades that there is real help, there is
[2:24:53.560 --> 2:24:57.960]  real solutions. Oh, so it's a product. Okay, well I appreciate your call. I
[2:24:57.960 --> 2:25:01.880]  appreciate your call. Send me an email about it. Okay, so I can learn more. Thank
[2:25:01.880 --> 2:25:08.320]  you. I appreciate the call. Jeff in New York, you're on the air. Go ahead. Yes,
[2:25:08.320 --> 2:25:11.960]  hello, Alex. This is Jeffrey Smith in New York. As you know, I'm the Northeast
[2:25:11.960 --> 2:25:17.800]  Director of the American Free Press. You know, much of the public relations and
[2:25:17.800 --> 2:25:21.720]  press relations for the United Nations is actually handled by a private
[2:25:21.720 --> 2:25:25.120]  organization which is called the Communications Committee for the
[2:25:25.120 --> 2:25:30.160]  United Nations. They are basically a collection of people. They typically have
[2:25:30.160 --> 2:25:35.760]  cable TV shows. They will have on-air shows, indicated TV shows, webcams, that
[2:25:35.760 --> 2:25:39.640]  kind of thing. They tend to be that level of media and above, and they have
[2:25:39.640 --> 2:25:44.960]  other employees of CBS, their employees of major media, that type of thing. Yeah,
[2:25:44.960 --> 2:25:49.800]  the U.N. has its people everywhere. That's agenda 21. Right now, exactly.
[2:25:49.800 --> 2:25:55.120]  Now, the thing is that every year they have their annual gathering, and what
[2:25:55.120 --> 2:26:00.080]  happens is it has become, it's become a place where the local
[2:26:00.080 --> 2:26:06.640]  patriots roll over the Northeast, show up, and have a dialogue with
[2:26:06.640 --> 2:26:10.880]  these people, and you'd be surprised how accommodating they are because they
[2:26:10.880 --> 2:26:15.200]  need lively guests on their programs. Otherwise, their programs turn into
[2:26:15.200 --> 2:26:19.400]  radio cue, but with no one else to listen to. So every year they have this
[2:26:19.400 --> 2:26:24.320]  gathering. It is an open-door party, okay? Well, open-door gathering, Christmas
[2:26:24.320 --> 2:26:31.400]  gathering. Basically, it is going to be held this Friday, okay? The 18th, it's
[2:26:31.400 --> 2:26:36.640]  going to be from 9 p.m. to typically 4 a.m., and it's going to be all the
[2:26:36.640 --> 2:26:41.920]  media types who are promoters of the United Nations versus any patriot who
[2:26:41.920 --> 2:26:46.360]  wants to walk in because it's an open-door party. It's going to be a 241
[2:26:46.360 --> 2:26:50.680]  West 36th Street, if you know Manhattan. That's between 7th and 8th
[2:26:50.680 --> 2:26:55.040]  Avenue, and it's open-door. Oh, yeah. These globalists love to try to sell you.
[2:26:55.040 --> 2:26:58.320]  That's why Rothkopf, the head of the Kissinger Group, came on this show
[2:26:58.320 --> 2:27:02.760]  trying to sell me on World Government. So, see, they'll try to sell you
[2:27:02.760 --> 2:27:06.600]  individually, but then, meanwhile, say it doesn't exist, it doesn't exist, but
[2:27:06.600 --> 2:27:11.440]  we need World Government. But, so, what's the official name of this party?
[2:27:11.440 --> 2:27:17.840]  It's the Communications Committee for the United Nations. It's held every year,
[2:27:17.840 --> 2:27:24.520]  and it's this year, it's December 18th. It's going to be from 9 p.m. on. It's
[2:27:24.520 --> 2:27:32.360]  going to be a 241 West 36th, 241 West 36th Street between 7th and 8th Avenue on
[2:27:32.360 --> 2:27:37.520]  the north side of the street. The guy heads it as a complete, he has one of
[2:27:37.520 --> 2:27:42.680]  these apartments in an old loft, which basically is like a 10-year apartment.
[2:27:42.680 --> 2:27:45.680]  Alright, interesting. I appreciate your call. That's great. Yeah, there's all
[2:27:45.680 --> 2:27:49.160]  sorts of interesting globalist events always going on in your town or city,
[2:27:49.160 --> 2:27:54.840]  and it's good to go attend the public events, and they're slick. They'll try to
[2:27:54.840 --> 2:27:59.440]  turn you to the dark side, but take some of my videos there. Take Fall the
[2:27:59.440 --> 2:28:03.960]  Republican, educate people. That's a great call, Jeff. Thank you. Let's talk to
[2:28:03.960 --> 2:28:09.360]  Kevin and Mass. Kevin, you're on the air. Alex, great to talk to you, buddy. Hey,
[2:28:09.360 --> 2:28:14.520]  I just want to thank you for all you're doing with the vaccine, waking people up
[2:28:14.520 --> 2:28:21.440]  over here. I'm originally from New York, and they were Richard Daines, the
[2:28:21.440 --> 2:28:26.040]  State Health Commissioner over there in New York, was trying to force the
[2:28:26.040 --> 2:28:30.000]  healthcare workers over there in August, he put out a vaccination requirement for
[2:28:30.000 --> 2:28:34.240]  them or their jobs were at stake. And I just want to thank you, Alex, for all you
[2:28:34.240 --> 2:28:39.400]  do and how you show people to get a spine and to stand up for them.
[2:28:39.400 --> 2:28:43.800]  Yeah, notice they, God bless you, but let me just make this point. This is a
[2:28:43.800 --> 2:28:49.320]  great point you're leading into here. We were all going to have to take it.
[2:28:49.320 --> 2:28:53.160]  It was going to be the law. Millions were going to die. The flu was going to
[2:28:53.160 --> 2:29:00.560]  kill us. Now indictments are beginning of EU members, UN, WHO members. As it comes
[2:29:00.560 --> 2:29:05.840]  out, they lied to make money and to push the vaccine and almost no one's taking
[2:29:05.840 --> 2:29:10.920]  the shot. Hundreds of millions of dosages are rotting in the North, in
[2:29:10.920 --> 2:29:16.960]  Canada, in the US, in England, and it blew up in their face because we got the
[2:29:16.960 --> 2:29:22.680]  word out and educated people about what was on the insert. So go ahead. Well, I
[2:29:22.680 --> 2:29:27.320]  wanted to make it, I wanted to put a warning out there to Alex because what
[2:29:27.320 --> 2:29:31.480]  they're doing now is you know how they spin everything. Well, what happened
[2:29:31.480 --> 2:29:35.880]  was a temporary restraining order was issued by Judge McNamara, the acting
[2:29:35.880 --> 2:29:40.080]  state Supreme Court justice. Stay there. Stay there. Stay there, Kevin. Yeah. Mass
[2:29:40.080 --> 2:29:46.240]  passed a law to conform with Bush's and Obama's executive orders that they could
[2:29:46.240 --> 2:29:50.760]  quarantine you, arrest you, imprison you, forcibly inoculate you.
[2:29:50.760 --> 2:29:57.840]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio
[2:29:57.840 --> 2:30:05.560]  Network. Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[2:30:05.560 --> 2:30:10.200]  This is our last chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this
[2:30:10.200 --> 2:30:14.680]  agenda, that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home. I have
[2:30:14.680 --> 2:30:19.880]  tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the
[2:30:19.880 --> 2:30:25.040]  shards. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[2:30:25.040 --> 2:30:29.560]  attention. For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal
[2:30:29.560 --> 2:30:34.240]  offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[2:30:34.240 --> 2:30:37.880]  constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, their arsonists,
[2:30:37.880 --> 2:30:41.440]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the
[2:30:41.440 --> 2:30:46.680]  checkout to? Today seems like nobody does care. And right now in Washington, DC, we
[2:30:46.680 --> 2:30:52.320]  have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD

[2:31:04.240 --> 2:31:08.120]  you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much
[2:31:08.120 --> 2:31:12.440]  ammunition do you want? My answer would be all I can get in the battle for
[2:31:12.440 --> 2:31:16.960]  freedom and the lives of your loved ones. Food is your only ammunition. How much
[2:31:16.960 --> 2:31:21.280]  do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts? When will you
[2:31:21.280 --> 2:31:25.120]  need it? Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food?
[2:31:25.120 --> 2:31:28.880]  Will it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed
[2:31:28.880 --> 2:31:33.080]  yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out all
[2:31:33.080 --> 2:31:37.560]  these problems if you have a good food supply. Food is your ammunition to fight
[2:31:37.560 --> 2:31:42.240]  for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know. How much do
[2:31:42.240 --> 2:31:46.760]  you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to live to

[2:33:11.440 --> 2:33:18.840]  the front with Russia. The Cold War is back in a big wave after NATO forces
[2:33:18.840 --> 2:33:24.160]  launched a sneak attack on 888 against Russia, which was real. They are now
[2:33:24.160 --> 2:33:29.520]  threatening preemptive nuclear attacks on Western Europe if any more of these
[2:33:29.520 --> 2:33:37.120]  attacks are launched or are prepared to be launched. The world is in the greatest
[2:33:37.120 --> 2:33:43.000]  danger it's ever been and it's just gonna get worse from here. I'm gonna break
[2:33:43.000 --> 2:33:46.440]  this down later. I have two guests from Copenhagen joining us but let's get
[2:33:46.440 --> 2:33:51.720]  through your calls now. So, Kevin and Mass, yes, they've ordered all the police
[2:33:51.720 --> 2:33:56.400]  medical workers inoculated. The order says they can make the population take
[2:33:56.400 --> 2:34:01.520]  shots. Everybody started rebelling. New York rebelled. Their nurses rebelled. That
[2:34:01.520 --> 2:34:06.640]  got blocked at their Supreme Court level. All you got was an injunction so now
[2:34:06.640 --> 2:34:09.840]  they're spinning it. I saw this in the news, correct me if I'm wrong. Oh, now
[2:34:09.840 --> 2:34:14.520]  you've still got to take the shot. In Land of the Free, Home of the Brave, you've
[2:34:14.520 --> 2:34:19.040]  got to take the shot. Their asinine point is, well, you might get flu and give it
[2:34:19.040 --> 2:34:22.800]  to somebody else but wait, the idiots that want it can take it and get the flu
[2:34:22.800 --> 2:34:26.320]  and die or get sick or get cancer. We know it's in there. We know it's on the
[2:34:26.320 --> 2:34:31.800]  insert. How, if you don't take it, how does that make somebody else sick? Who
[2:34:31.800 --> 2:34:36.840]  has taken it? But go ahead and make your point. Well, my point was, Alex, is I want
[2:34:36.840 --> 2:34:42.800]  people not to give up because as you preach too, you have to stand up to get
[2:34:42.800 --> 2:34:45.760]  these tyrants to back down. And they don't want to admit the reason why they
[2:34:45.760 --> 2:34:50.720]  back down is because we stood up. And now the temporary injunction, they used
[2:34:50.720 --> 2:34:55.360]  the reason, well, we backed off of this because, you know, we didn't have enough
[2:34:55.360 --> 2:35:00.640]  vaccine to go around. So we want to focus on your little children and the
[2:35:00.640 --> 2:35:04.600]  elderly people. Meanwhile, you and I both know they want to kill our future and
[2:35:04.600 --> 2:35:09.440]  our past. So the mind controlled mainstream people. Yeah, there does more than
[2:35:09.440 --> 2:35:14.480]  half the corn syrup products with mercury on purpose. Washington Post and I mean,
[2:35:14.480 --> 2:35:18.720]  you know, but they care about the children. Right. And, you know, if they
[2:35:18.720 --> 2:35:22.440]  figure if they eliminate the future and eliminate the past, then they'll just
[2:35:22.440 --> 2:35:28.400]  have their mind controlled, you know, 25 to 45 year old people here that can
[2:35:28.400 --> 2:35:33.280]  still work and be their slaves. And now with the robotics going in and all the
[2:35:33.280 --> 2:35:37.640]  new high tech, Kurzweil and all the globalists say they don't want us
[2:35:37.640 --> 2:35:44.320]  anymore. That's the whole point. They want to call us down to five to 15 to 20%
[2:35:44.320 --> 2:35:48.920]  they debate that to a couple hundred million people. And then that's it. And
[2:35:48.920 --> 2:35:52.920]  then and we're just there for them to toy with. No, you're not our gods. You're
[2:35:52.920 --> 2:35:56.560]  not our masters criminals. See, they just dress up like there are authorities
[2:35:56.560 --> 2:36:00.640]  and say, we are your masters. We own you now. No, it's over criminals. You're
[2:36:00.640 --> 2:36:04.960]  going to lose. I appreciate your call, Kevin. Let's go ahead and talk to Chris
[2:36:04.960 --> 2:36:09.960]  in Florida. Go ahead, Chris. Well, Kevin just brought up interesting and the
[2:36:09.960 --> 2:36:14.120]  interesting issue of vaccinations. And I had the pleasure of interviewing William
[2:36:14.120 --> 2:36:19.200]  Maxfield MD, who says that on my radio show Liberation Station, and he says
[2:36:19.200 --> 2:36:25.880]  that subcutaneous injection of the buyer of the of the vaccination serum is much
[2:36:25.880 --> 2:36:30.600]  more effective and requires about a fifth of the serum instead of the usual
[2:36:30.600 --> 2:36:36.160]  intramuscular, which causes more side effects and more inflammation. So it's
[2:36:36.160 --> 2:36:41.800]  not side effects. A side effect means they didn't mean it to happen. Yeah,
[2:36:41.800 --> 2:36:45.480]  yeah, they're deadly. I would never take one myself. I just want everyone to
[2:36:45.480 --> 2:36:49.960]  understand that they're trying to give us the most deadly serum possible and by
[2:36:49.960 --> 2:36:55.360]  by intramuscular rather than subcutaneous injection. And I wanted to expand a
[2:36:55.360 --> 2:36:58.360]  little bit on I called you on the weekend, a couple of weekends ago about
[2:36:58.360 --> 2:37:02.920]  this atmospheric science program from the Department of Energy quoting the top
[2:37:02.920 --> 2:37:07.000]  it says the current focus of the program is aerosol radiative forcing of
[2:37:07.000 --> 2:37:10.920]  climate makes for a very interesting read. Well, when you look at the logo at
[2:37:10.920 --> 2:37:16.240]  the top, it includes a human figure enveloped in the double DNA, double helix
[2:37:16.240 --> 2:37:20.600]  DNA, and it just goes to show their true intention of trying to ruin our
[2:37:20.600 --> 2:37:28.000]  genetic structure and and the mutate us and also spraying these heavy medical
[2:37:28.000 --> 2:37:32.040]  or these heavy metals and toxins that the spring on us that we need to be
[2:37:32.040 --> 2:37:35.720]  aware of. Let me stop you, sir. I haven't seen that particular document
[2:37:35.720 --> 2:37:41.080]  because literally in the last three years or so intensely, since the mid
[2:37:41.080 --> 2:37:45.440]  nineties, I've been researching it. It's kind of like the JFK assassination. I
[2:37:45.440 --> 2:37:49.720]  get into it. I've been making a film for five years with chemtrails. I've had
[2:37:49.720 --> 2:37:52.520]  camera men all over the country. I've got government documents. I've got
[2:37:52.520 --> 2:37:59.400]  videos of science firms at the UN admitting what they're doing to us. And
[2:37:59.400 --> 2:38:03.400]  that's the point is I'm glad you called in about an actual document because
[2:38:03.400 --> 2:38:07.040]  there's so many where they just admit they're already manipulating the
[2:38:07.040 --> 2:38:11.560]  atmosphere. So what are they talking about? Oh, we better have taxes or the
[2:38:11.560 --> 2:38:15.680]  atmosphere will deteriorate when we actually look at what they're spraying.
[2:38:15.680 --> 2:38:20.440]  It does mess up our atmosphere. So they're messing up the atmosphere while
[2:38:20.440 --> 2:38:24.840]  meanwhile saying get ready for big calamities. This is a big deal, but real
[2:38:24.840 --> 2:38:31.880]  fast. Give me the name of that particular atmospheric manipulation paper by the
[2:38:31.880 --> 2:38:35.200]  Department of Energy. I'm familiar with literally you put in these terms. You
[2:38:35.200 --> 2:38:40.040]  get millions of papers and documents and every major university involved in
[2:38:40.040 --> 2:38:43.480]  every major federal department involved in international treaties and they're
[2:38:43.480 --> 2:38:47.560]  spraying us everywhere and poisoning the water and giggling and snickering. And
[2:38:47.560 --> 2:38:53.280]  it's so funny to them. And the news is now going, you may need drugs in the
[2:38:53.280 --> 2:38:58.280]  water to make you behave. So they're now introducing to the slaves. They're
[2:38:58.280 --> 2:39:01.680]  already drugging the water, but now they're letting the slaves know like 10
[2:39:01.680 --> 2:39:05.520]  years after the cell phones are used to track you. They now tell the slaves. Also
[2:39:05.520 --> 2:39:09.960]  email that to showtipsandinfowars.com. All your government documents about
[2:39:09.960 --> 2:39:14.440]  chemtrails. We should just start posting a raw area of just the documents
[2:39:14.440 --> 2:39:18.120]  themselves instead of just telling people where the documents are. Give me
[2:39:18.120 --> 2:39:23.360]  the name real fast of that document again. Do a web search for DOE for
[2:39:23.360 --> 2:39:30.400]  Department of Energy atmospheric science program or just go to www.asp for
[2:39:30.400 --> 2:39:35.840]  atmospheric science program dot b as in boy and as a Nancy Ellis and Larry dot
[2:39:35.840 --> 2:39:39.880]  gov. No, I understand their site, but I mean, what's the particular name of
[2:39:39.880 --> 2:39:45.800]  this paper or this group? The atmospheric science program. Yes. And it's
[2:39:45.800 --> 2:39:49.880]  the last updated November 12th and it talks about cloud interactions, aerosol
[2:39:49.880 --> 2:39:55.880]  and cloud related research components. But no, I've seen that October, the
[2:39:55.880 --> 2:39:59.000]  atmospheric science program and the atmospheric radiation measurement
[2:39:59.000 --> 2:40:02.400]  program. But you know, they know that they're messing with our DNA and
[2:40:02.400 --> 2:40:06.200]  there are things we can do about it like food grade, diatomaceous earth and
[2:40:06.200 --> 2:40:09.760]  something I recently discovered is just amazing for so many things as
[2:40:09.760 --> 2:40:14.680]  Kangan water. Kangan water has just been made a great difference in my life and
[2:40:14.680 --> 2:40:17.840]  many of my friends. It's a medical device in Japan and in Canada. More
[2:40:17.840 --> 2:40:22.280]  recently, it's great for detoxifying, alkalinizing, energizing and it's
[2:40:22.280 --> 2:40:26.640]  helped so many diseases and conditions. It has decades worth of research on
[2:40:26.640 --> 2:40:29.760]  it. I'll send you more information on that also, but that's just a very
[2:40:29.760 --> 2:40:33.520]  inexpensive cure. Thanks a lot. I got to get to other callers. I really
[2:40:33.520 --> 2:40:41.360]  appreciate that call, Chris. Ron in Texas. Go ahead. Yeah, buddy. Hey, how
[2:40:41.360 --> 2:40:46.160]  you doing? Great. Talk to you again. Talk to you. Hey, I was just wanting to
[2:40:46.160 --> 2:40:51.320]  know, I was in the middle of doing some stuff and I heard bits and pieces of
[2:40:51.320 --> 2:40:58.160]  your conversation with Lord Mompton and what he was saying about this
[2:40:58.320 --> 2:41:03.160]  globalization treaty thing of the Copenhagen. My understanding was that
[2:41:03.160 --> 2:41:08.280]  it's still in a stalemate. Is that correct? No, they say that to make you
[2:41:08.280 --> 2:41:13.120]  stand down. It's a political trick. They're not going to be able to get. We
[2:41:13.120 --> 2:41:19.760]  hope it looks like by tomorrow night, a open treaty waving everything to
[2:41:19.760 --> 2:41:25.840]  global government and establishing all of the taxes now. Instead, they're
[2:41:25.840 --> 2:41:32.960]  going to agree to an intergovernmental agreement to fund bureaucracies and so
[2:41:32.960 --> 2:41:38.160]  do it illegally. And Schwarzenegger has had meetings chairing the group of
[2:41:38.160 --> 2:41:44.000]  mayors and governors. That's AP, AFP and Reuters that he will lead a global
[2:41:44.000 --> 2:41:48.200]  group to bypass national governments and implement at the city and county
[2:41:48.200 --> 2:41:53.160]  level. Sir, that's already happening. I mean, the city of Austin is run by the
[2:41:53.160 --> 2:41:57.280]  United Nations publicly. I mean, they openly are run. The police are trained
[2:41:57.280 --> 2:42:02.160]  by UN programs. They have exchange programs. They have a former special
[2:42:02.160 --> 2:42:07.680]  forces commander who runs the environmental program. I mean, this is a
[2:42:07.680 --> 2:42:11.720]  cold-blooded group of people and they know exactly what they're doing. And so
[2:42:11.720 --> 2:42:15.800]  look again, Schwarzenegger is just publicly announcing what they're
[2:42:15.800 --> 2:42:19.520]  already doing. They've got their operatives over all the major school
[2:42:19.520 --> 2:42:25.280]  districts, everything. Yeah, this is a takeover, sir. This is a infiltration.
[2:42:25.920 --> 2:42:31.280]  Yeah, yeah, I figured that much. I just wanted to get a good confirmation of
[2:42:31.280 --> 2:42:34.080]  what he was saying. Because like I said, the only way I can hear you is over
[2:42:34.080 --> 2:42:36.560]  the internet because I only live like an hour away from where you're
[2:42:36.560 --> 2:42:41.080]  broadcasting. But for some reason I can't pick you up on a radio. Where are
[2:42:41.080 --> 2:42:46.560]  you? Where are you? I'm in Colleen, actually. You can pick up the show. Yeah,
[2:42:46.560 --> 2:42:50.680]  I try, but I can't seem to find it. You can pick it up. They carry, I think,
[2:42:50.680 --> 2:42:56.040]  three hours a day at 1330. Okay. I'll see you by the end of the day. 1330 comes
[2:42:56.040 --> 2:43:01.840]  in. Claire is a whistle where you live. Great. I'll, I'll try a different
[2:43:01.840 --> 2:43:10.320]  radio then. Have you tried 1330? Have you tried 1330? For some reason, I guess
[2:43:10.320 --> 2:43:14.040]  maybe in the area that I live, it's very hard for me to pick up some radio
[2:43:14.040 --> 2:43:20.160]  stations. Are you near power lines? A lot. And I got a lot of black helicopter
[2:43:20.160 --> 2:43:24.040]  traffic and long boat traffic. Yeah, you may have some big government
[2:43:24.040 --> 2:43:29.080]  transmitters that interfere because for some reason, 590 a.m. is a blowtorch
[2:43:29.080 --> 2:43:33.960]  that covers more than half of Texas. Yeah. And sometimes if I'm in one room in
[2:43:33.960 --> 2:43:38.240]  my house, it won't even come in there in the daytime when it's at full power. So
[2:43:38.240 --> 2:43:40.840]  AM's a weird thing. But listen, I appreciate your call. I'm going to jump.
[2:43:40.880 --> 2:43:44.520]  So I got to get this news for our guests come up. Thank you so much, Ron. Let's
[2:43:44.520 --> 2:43:48.880]  talk to Ron in Georgia. Go ahead, Ron. Alex Jones. Been waiting three years
[2:43:48.880 --> 2:43:55.760]  to talk to you, son. Well, here we are. There you are. Um, I heard a guy talk
[2:43:55.800 --> 2:44:01.520]  about two weeks ago about how we're going to be defeated. Bull, we are not
[2:44:01.520 --> 2:44:09.440]  going to be defeated. This is how we educate your children. Well, we know
[2:44:09.440 --> 2:44:15.880]  we're going to get defeated if we if we bend over and say I'm your slave. I
[2:44:15.880 --> 2:44:24.360]  cried my eyes out. Last week, my daughter had a she's 11 years old. I
[2:44:24.360 --> 2:44:30.200]  raised I raised two kids. One's autistic and my daughter. One's been
[2:44:30.200 --> 2:44:38.360]  vaccinated. One hasn't. Okay, my 11 year old daughter had a paper to write
[2:44:38.360 --> 2:44:51.280]  for school. She wrote on the, um, she wrote a paper on having the IRS be
[2:44:51.280 --> 2:44:55.280]  gone. And that's her ride as an American to have free speech. What
[2:44:55.280 --> 2:44:59.800]  happened? Oh, oh, no, she got an A. Oh, good. Well, the teacher's awake. Then
[2:44:59.800 --> 2:45:04.440]  good. Oh, yeah. So you cried for happiness. You want everybody's awake
[2:45:04.440 --> 2:45:11.040]  here. Everybody's awake here. She did a paper on Hitler last year. Um, I got
[2:45:11.040 --> 2:45:17.480]  called into the principal's office because she exposed that, um, Prescott
[2:45:17.480 --> 2:45:21.800]  Bush funded Hitler. Well, that was in the New York Times, what she's not
[2:45:21.800 --> 2:45:26.240]  allowed to report on that. Well, they wanted to know that the principal
[2:45:26.240 --> 2:45:30.920]  wanted to know where she got her information from. I said, well, she
[2:45:30.920 --> 2:45:35.780]  got it from me. She got it from the internet. It's right there. And
[2:45:36.440 --> 2:45:43.880]  principal said, well, you know, I have a doctorate big deal. And, um, and I
[2:45:43.880 --> 2:45:47.560]  said, well, apparently you've been reading the wrong book woman. You
[2:45:47.560 --> 2:45:51.600]  know, I didn't know what else to say. Um, the other thing, well, let me
[2:45:51.600 --> 2:45:57.760]  give her sources. Then the McCormick Dickstein committee of Congress. The
[2:45:57.760 --> 2:46:06.080]  books written by a Marine Corps, uh, General Smendley Butler, uh, the
[2:46:06.080 --> 2:46:14.320]  New York Times, whatever the New York, New Jersey paper is, uh, BBC. Let's
[2:46:14.320 --> 2:46:18.640]  just do this right now. Bush's grandfather worked for Nazis. You'll
[2:46:18.640 --> 2:46:24.040]  get BBC, everything else. I mean, it's an absolute fact. Members of his
[2:46:24.040 --> 2:46:28.600]  bank were arrested. He got out of it narrowly because it went so high into
[2:46:28.600 --> 2:46:35.440]  Cume Loeb and other companies that the US or some. Yeah, there it is. The
[2:46:35.440 --> 2:46:38.680]  London Guardian. Well, here, let's read this for the teacher. I mean, the
[2:46:38.680 --> 2:46:41.920]  moron principal could figure this out, but they've got a doctorate, which
[2:46:41.920 --> 2:46:46.400]  means they know how to be a moron. It goes on. How Bush's grandfather
[2:46:46.400 --> 2:46:51.640]  helped Hitler's rise to power. So I mean, there's a London Guardian. I
[2:46:51.640 --> 2:46:57.800]  mean, I don't know what they want. So how did this end with the, uh, how did
[2:46:57.800 --> 2:47:04.800]  this end with the principal? Oh, well, I'm on the, uh, no talk list, but
[2:47:04.800 --> 2:47:11.200]  whatever. Um, as an aside, Alex, before, you know, you let me go, um, Neil
[2:47:11.200 --> 2:47:17.400]  Bort, which is one of the biggest punches in the world. Last Friday,
[2:47:17.400 --> 2:47:25.680]  December 11th, called for an economic refugee camp because he does not
[2:47:25.680 --> 2:47:31.760]  want to live next to poor people. And that's what Schwarzenegger is doing. He
[2:47:31.760 --> 2:47:35.640]  now arrests the homeless people, even if they're in their own little camper. I
[2:47:35.640 --> 2:47:38.960]  mean, people get bankrupt. They get a little camper. They're living in it at a
[2:47:38.960 --> 2:47:43.560]  city park, you know, driving around even with jobs. They come arrest you, take
[2:47:43.560 --> 2:47:47.760]  it, laugh at you. At night, you get locked up in these poor houses. And the
[2:47:47.760 --> 2:47:51.920]  same thing in Hawaii is happening in front of people's faces and they can't
[2:47:51.920 --> 2:47:57.120]  see it. But see Neil Bort's next, it'll be next. It'll be let's make them work
[2:47:57.120 --> 2:48:00.400]  in these work camps. And you got to love how Neil Bort's pushes a national
[2:48:00.400 --> 2:48:05.320]  sales tax, which is what the UN wants. Again, no, we don't need more taxes. See
[2:48:05.320 --> 2:48:09.640]  they're going to keep the income tax and give us his flat fare tax. I
[2:48:09.640 --> 2:48:16.240]  appreciate your call. Yeah, I was at ground zero interviewing victims of
[2:48:16.240 --> 2:48:22.600]  9 11. And this big guy walks over and starts poking me. It's online. That's
[2:48:22.600 --> 2:48:25.280]  Neil Bort's because I'm like 5 10.
[2:48:30.040 --> 2:48:32.720]  And he's like probably about six, six, he's towering. You know, I love it when
[2:48:32.720 --> 2:48:36.360]  big guys think it intimidates you. All it makes me want to do is attack them and
[2:48:36.360 --> 2:48:43.520]  they start hanging over you, getting in your face. And you're sitting there and
[2:48:43.520 --> 2:48:48.040]  he starts cussing at me. Starts, you know, I'm not going to repeat it here on
[2:48:48.040 --> 2:48:52.280]  air, obviously. And I said, why don't you come on and debate me? And he said,
[2:48:52.280 --> 2:48:55.640]  no, you got to pay me money to debate you. You got to pay me money. I'm all
[2:48:55.640 --> 2:49:00.440]  about money. I'm a conservative. Know what you are as a fake conservative whore
[2:49:00.440 --> 2:49:04.320]  for the new world order. And look, it's not my job to sit here and attack Neil
[2:49:04.320 --> 2:49:07.520]  Bort's and people, but I heard that guy six, seven, eight years ago. He's been
[2:49:07.520 --> 2:49:13.320]  on Austin a long time saying that there's no new world order, no world
[2:49:13.320 --> 2:49:19.480]  government. And I heard him say, I was a liar about Operation Northwoods. And he
[2:49:19.480 --> 2:49:22.760]  said it didn't exist when it was an ABC news, Baltimore sun and his
[2:49:22.760 --> 2:49:29.760]  declassified note. You're the liar, Mr. Bort's. Now, years later, he admitted
[2:49:29.760 --> 2:49:35.880]  it later, but I'm not the liar. Do I make mistakes sometime? Yes. You know, I was
[2:49:35.880 --> 2:49:43.360]  once on KTSA in San Antonio talking about 9-11 being an inside job. And it was
[2:49:43.360 --> 2:49:51.920]  one of the where pair, the son, what Trey where? And he said, he said, Alex, he
[2:49:51.920 --> 2:49:55.480]  goes, I think you're, you know, a good person. He said, and I believe you're
[2:49:55.480 --> 2:49:59.440]  sincere, but you better hope you're right about 9-11 because you got God to
[2:49:59.440 --> 2:50:05.080]  answer to if you're up here saying the government did 9-11 and you're wrong. And
[2:50:05.080 --> 2:50:10.680]  I appreciated that not criticism, but that honest challenge because when I sat
[2:50:10.680 --> 2:50:14.440]  back, I was in New York at the time I was on a cell phone doing a, doing a Texas
[2:50:14.440 --> 2:50:18.640]  interview. I sat back and I reflected and I thought about it for a few days and I
[2:50:18.640 --> 2:50:23.640]  thought, yeah, I feel good about what I've said and done. I've told the truth.
[2:50:23.640 --> 2:50:29.080]  I mean, no one could look at the evidence of 9-11 and say that that was
[2:50:29.080 --> 2:50:36.360]  guys from a cave in Afghanistan. Give me a break, folks. And I have to tell the
[2:50:36.360 --> 2:50:41.040]  truth. That's all I've got is my integrity. Does that mean I'm perfect? No. But
[2:50:41.040 --> 2:50:45.120]  I mean, I try to be a good person. I try to tell the truth. I try to be moral. I
[2:50:45.120 --> 2:50:49.800]  try to be upstanding. There's a lot of people out there think being evil and
[2:50:49.800 --> 2:50:58.360]  lying is cute. They think being evil is tough. And I can stand before God from
[2:50:58.360 --> 2:51:21.960]  what I've done. I'm proud of myself.
[2:51:58.880 --> 2:52:04.920]  Try Liquid Zeolite today. Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the
[2:52:04.920 --> 2:52:09.920]  last century alone. This is our last chance to not relive history. As we're
[2:52:09.920 --> 2:52:13.720]  finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the
[2:52:13.720 --> 2:52:18.440]  Americans at home. I have tremendous influence on our president in Congress
[2:52:18.440 --> 2:52:23.840]  and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as
[2:52:23.840 --> 2:52:28.520]  American citizens to pay attention. Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies
[2:52:28.520 --> 2:52:33.560]  of our nation. The criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty
[2:52:33.560 --> 2:52:37.680]  and on its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and
[2:52:37.680 --> 2:52:41.560]  arsonists. They're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do
[2:52:41.560 --> 2:52:45.360]  we make the checkout to? Today seems like nobody does care and right now in
[2:52:45.360 --> 2:52:51.360]  Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic. Yet your copy of Fall of the

[2:54:07.240 --> 2:54:15.200]  Huge story at prisonplanet.com. Exclusive lead, author,
[2:54:15.200 --> 2:54:24.120]  admits deleting inconvenient opinions from IPCC report. That's a decent headline
[2:54:24.120 --> 2:54:28.800]  dealing with Al Gore's fraud of inconvenient truth, but maybe we edit
[2:54:28.800 --> 2:54:37.360]  here on air. Maybe the headline should be lead, author, admits deleting
[2:54:37.800 --> 2:54:42.960]  scientific reports that may not changing weather from IPCC report. I guess
[2:54:42.960 --> 2:54:48.080]  that'd be too long. I mean, this is big. This is as big as climate gate. The
[2:54:48.080 --> 2:54:51.440]  problem is you have one big explosion like that. This won't get as much
[2:54:51.440 --> 2:54:54.280]  attention unless people really try to get it out there to people, but this is
[2:54:54.280 --> 2:54:59.480]  really another big victory against them. And we've got links to the YouTube. As
[2:54:59.480 --> 2:55:03.520]  long as it's up, I didn't post the YouTube of the TV show. I'm a consultant on it,
[2:55:03.520 --> 2:55:08.160]  and I don't know if the network would like that, but we certainly have
[2:55:08.160 --> 2:55:12.200]  links to it if you want to see it. It'll be rearing on true TV as well. But as
[2:55:12.200 --> 2:55:15.720]  long as that YouTube is up and they tend to be leaving them up, so I guess
[2:55:15.720 --> 2:55:21.920]  it's okay. Who knows? I talked to the producers of it. I don't talk to
[2:55:21.920 --> 2:55:30.120]  people over at the network. That's up on prisonplanet.com right now when the
[2:55:30.120 --> 2:55:35.160]  show ends or tonight. If you missed the episode, you can check your TV guide
[2:55:35.160 --> 2:55:40.320]  for what is going to be rearing on true TV or watch it via YouTube. We have it
[2:55:40.320 --> 2:55:44.720]  linked again up on prisonplanet.com right now. I checked it this morning, and
[2:55:44.720 --> 2:55:48.560]  they were probably, I quit counting. There were over 50 different versions of
[2:55:48.560 --> 2:55:53.280]  the whole show on YouTube, so if it'll be like whack-a-mole, if somebody does
[2:55:53.280 --> 2:55:56.680]  want to take it down, you should be able to find it. But certainly, you want to
[2:55:56.680 --> 2:56:02.960]  watch the next Big Brother piece next Wednesday, 10 p.m. That is going to be
[2:56:02.960 --> 2:56:07.440]  extremely informative. Speaking of underground material that Big Brother
[2:56:07.440 --> 2:56:10.760]  really doesn't want you to see who the bankers are, what their master plan is,
[2:56:10.760 --> 2:56:14.360]  how the environmental movement is a eugenics movement that to destroy your
[2:56:14.360 --> 2:56:18.160]  sovereignty and set up the New World Order, it's all covered in fall of the
[2:56:18.160 --> 2:56:25.920]  Republic and until Christmas or until the t-shirts run out and they are running
[2:56:25.920 --> 2:56:31.080]  out. Now again, you can still get a free t-shirt because as the Obama Joker
[2:56:31.080 --> 2:56:36.240]  t-shirts run out, we've added a few other popular t-shirts in the sizes that have

[3:00:00.880 --> 3:00:24.080]  We are going to continue with open phones at 1-800-259-9231. I would hope for those
[3:00:24.080 --> 3:00:28.320]  already holding and those that call in though to be a little bit considerate of
[3:00:28.320 --> 3:00:34.520]  our guests. William F. Jasper, senior editor of the New American magazine,
[3:00:34.520 --> 3:00:38.840]  investigative reporter. I learned a lot from him when I was in high school and
[3:00:38.840 --> 3:00:43.520]  college reading the New American. And of course Alex Newman, he's a freelance
[3:00:43.520 --> 3:00:47.600]  writer but also writes for the New American. They are together in Copenhagen
[3:00:47.600 --> 3:00:52.520]  Denmark in the closing 48 hours of the climate summit. We just had Lord
[3:00:52.520 --> 3:00:58.440]  Moncton on in the first hour. He was beat up by a police officer today. The U.N.
[3:00:58.440 --> 3:01:02.600]  police and others are attacking accredited reporters that have passes to
[3:01:02.600 --> 3:01:06.240]  get in. They're not letting them in. They're attacking reporters. I've seen
[3:01:06.240 --> 3:01:09.480]  countless videos that go to press conferences. You ask about Climate
[3:01:09.480 --> 3:01:14.760]  Gate. You are drug out. You are trudging. We've got global government
[3:01:14.760 --> 3:01:20.440]  openly being announced. We've gone from 40 years ago, the John Birch
[3:01:20.440 --> 3:01:25.080]  Society and others being called kooks, loonies, nuts for reading official U.N.
[3:01:25.080 --> 3:01:29.880]  plans of Armand Hammer and others for world government. And David Rockefeller
[3:01:29.880 --> 3:01:31.480]  plans to now.
[3:01:33.000 --> 3:01:35.680]  Ban Ki-moon, Herman von Rumpi,
[3:01:38.120 --> 3:01:40.960]  David De Rothschild calling for global government.
[3:01:42.400 --> 3:01:46.520]  And I really think they've miscalculated by denying it all these years and now
[3:01:46.520 --> 3:01:53.800]  going, oh, yes, it's real. This has blown giant torpedo holes in their hole and
[3:01:53.800 --> 3:01:57.680]  Climate Gate has blown a giant hole in them. And now in the Jesse Ventura
[3:01:57.680 --> 3:02:03.720]  special that I consult for last night, the lead author of the IPC report IPCC
[3:02:03.720 --> 3:02:08.640]  that works for the U.N. and Maury Strong admits they cut out the five areas of
[3:02:08.640 --> 3:02:13.080]  the report where their own scientists said humans are not affecting climate. So
[3:02:13.080 --> 3:02:21.120]  another giant admission by these people. This is just devastating. We're going to
[3:02:21.120 --> 3:02:24.800]  break in a moment. Long seven coming up, but let's go to William F. Jasper first.
[3:02:24.800 --> 3:02:28.680]  William, what is it like for you for, I don't know, two decades or so, writing
[3:02:28.680 --> 3:02:32.520]  about the New World Order or longer and being laughed at when you had all the
[3:02:32.520 --> 3:02:36.240]  source documents now to just, it's all right out in the open.
[3:02:37.680 --> 3:02:42.080]  Well, it is Alex, but it, but it, but they're still openly denying it when
[3:02:42.080 --> 3:02:46.600]  you bring the things like this up in venues like here at Bella Center, where I
[3:02:46.600 --> 3:02:51.720]  am right now. Bella Center is the place where they're holding a conference to
[3:02:51.720 --> 3:02:57.200]  the Climate Summit. And right now, Alex and I are standing here in the media
[3:02:57.200 --> 3:03:03.200]  center, which is where all the so-called journalists are gathered, several
[3:03:03.200 --> 3:03:09.000]  thousand. And we have, you know, banks and banks of tables of people filing
[3:03:09.000 --> 3:03:15.080]  stories all over the world. Uh, and, uh, they're all in denial. They, they
[3:03:15.080 --> 3:03:19.520]  wanted to talk about climate, let alone about the New World Order or global
[3:03:19.520 --> 3:03:25.480]  governance. Even, even though they are quoting these regularly, they, they
[3:03:25.480 --> 3:03:28.600]  deny that there's any significance to these, to these terms.
[3:03:28.600 --> 3:03:31.880]  What do you call that psychologically? It's like they have a psychological
[3:03:31.880 --> 3:03:36.080]  compulsion or implanted idea because for 20 years they said it didn't exist or
[3:03:36.080 --> 3:03:39.600]  longer. Now that they admit it, they still can't report it. I mean, there's
[3:03:39.600 --> 3:03:43.160]  Schwarzenegger, there's Ban Ki-moon. They're all up there calling for
[3:03:43.160 --> 3:03:48.240]  planetary regimes, global government. And I've had national reporters here five
[3:03:48.240 --> 3:03:51.920]  or six of them the last month. And I play on clips of this and they say it
[3:03:51.920 --> 3:03:52.720]  doesn't exist.
[3:03:53.720 --> 3:04:01.680]  Well, yeah, I mean, it is, it's a form of psychological schizophrenia or, uh, just
[3:04:01.680 --> 3:04:06.640]  inability. They've self-censored themselves so that they will not think through
[3:04:06.640 --> 3:04:10.720]  what, what it is they're hearing and witnessing with their own eyes. Um,
[3:04:10.720 --> 3:04:16.720]  there have been, uh, almost, uh, nothing, uh, no people here that I, that I think
[3:04:16.720 --> 3:04:20.760]  that have had a past about five or six days. We tried today, Alex, uh, we got
[3:04:20.760 --> 3:04:25.920]  it on video. It's going to be going up pretty soon here. Uh, Alex was able to,
[3:04:25.920 --> 3:04:32.720]  uh, uh, corner, uh, representative Martin, uh, who, the Martin Waxman, well, uh,
[3:04:32.720 --> 3:04:38.320]  Martin Waxman still in the house representative, uh, for the, uh, uh, all
[3:04:38.320 --> 3:04:43.120]  of this, uh, climate on them. And, um, he asked him about, I think he just
[3:04:43.120 --> 3:04:45.800]  kind of passed right over it, wouldn't answer the question and we'll stay
[3:04:45.800 --> 3:04:50.400]  there. William F. Jasper, the editor of the New American Magazine, there in
[3:04:50.400 --> 3:04:55.280]  Copenhagen, uh, with his cohort, Alex Newman, he's going to break down what
[3:04:55.280 --> 3:04:59.680]  he's witnessed over there in the nest of globalists. He is in the heart of the
[3:04:59.680 --> 3:05:03.920]  disease. This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying
[3:05:03.920 --> 3:05:08.320]  a solar power generator. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double
[3:05:08.320 --> 3:05:12.560]  or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energy czar wants to control
[3:05:12.560 --> 3:05:16.560]  how much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true. Total
[3:05:16.560 --> 3:05:20.480]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[3:05:20.480 --> 3:05:24.720]  coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously
[3:05:24.720 --> 3:05:28.880]  overloaded. And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[3:05:28.880 --> 3:05:33.200]  problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every
[3:05:33.200 --> 3:05:36.880]  year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages. Number
[3:05:36.880 --> 3:05:41.040]  five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[3:05:41.040 --> 3:05:44.000]  mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by
[3:05:44.000 --> 3:05:47.920]  Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information

[3:06:02.880 --> 3:06:05.680]  important questions. If you're going into a battle
[3:06:05.680 --> 3:06:09.520]  and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[3:06:09.520 --> 3:06:12.960]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom
[3:06:12.960 --> 3:06:16.560]  and the lives of your loved ones. Food is your only ammunition.
[3:06:16.560 --> 3:06:20.720]  How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts?
[3:06:20.720 --> 3:06:24.000]  When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification?
[3:06:24.000 --> 3:06:28.080]  Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine
[3:06:28.080 --> 3:06:32.160]  and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[3:06:32.160 --> 3:06:35.760]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[3:06:35.760 --> 3:06:39.520]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[3:06:39.520 --> 3:06:43.680]  How much will you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get.
[3:06:43.680 --> 3:06:47.920]  I'm Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[3:06:47.920 --> 3:06:55.360]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[3:06:55.360 --> 3:07:02.320]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633. The illusion created by the power elite
[3:07:02.320 --> 3:07:05.520]  is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[3:07:05.520 --> 3:07:09.200]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that
[3:07:09.200 --> 3:07:12.320]  makes you sick? Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[3:07:12.320 --> 3:07:15.200]  You don't have to cooperate. There is a solution.
[3:07:15.200 --> 3:07:18.240]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love,

[3:07:36.480 --> 3:07:39.360]  Manager. I love their NutriCafe, great organic

[3:08:02.160 --> 3:08:08.640]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[3:08:08.640 --> 3:08:11.920]  William F. Jasper, Senior Editor of the New American Magazine,
[3:08:11.920 --> 3:08:17.360]  investigative reporter, author. He attended the 1992 Earth Summit
[3:08:17.360 --> 3:08:20.560]  in Rio de Janeiro and exposed the global authoritarian agenda
[3:08:20.560 --> 3:08:23.680]  being proposed to the planetary environmental regulation.
[3:08:23.680 --> 3:08:27.680]  You know, nobody deserves more credit exposing the fake green agenda to
[3:08:27.680 --> 3:08:32.160]  establish world government than the new American and chief among them,
[3:08:32.160 --> 3:08:39.520]  William F. Jasper, who I ran into in 1999 at an urban warfare martial law
[3:08:39.520 --> 3:08:43.920]  takeover drill in Northern California or in Central
[3:08:43.920 --> 3:08:48.880]  California in Oakland. It was interesting running into him.
[3:08:48.880 --> 3:08:52.720]  At that event, he's got Alex Newman, who also writes as a freelancer
[3:08:52.720 --> 3:08:55.200]  for the New American with him. They're on the same phone. We'll go to him in a
[3:08:55.200 --> 3:08:58.640]  moment. But we were talking about how they're
[3:08:58.640 --> 3:09:02.000]  denying there's global government while they're announcing
[3:09:02.000 --> 3:09:06.400]  that there's global government. We have the treaty here
[3:09:06.400 --> 3:09:09.920]  that actually says it's meant to shut down the third world and starve these
[3:09:09.920 --> 3:09:12.720]  people to death. They sold the third world as if it was some
[3:09:12.720 --> 3:09:16.320]  communistic experiment to give them free goodies.
[3:09:16.320 --> 3:09:19.840]  But just like Russians who believed Lenin, all they found out was they were
[3:09:19.840 --> 3:09:22.640]  going to slave camps. So let's talk about what you're
[3:09:22.640 --> 3:09:25.760]  witnessing there on the ground. What's behind this movement?
[3:09:25.760 --> 3:09:30.160]  Maurice Strong, who you got to see in person, say in Rio de Janeiro,
[3:09:30.160 --> 3:09:34.720]  we want to destroy the industrial society. What their goals are, who they are,
[3:09:34.720 --> 3:09:39.120]  explain to people who think that left us in communist or grass roots.
[3:09:39.120 --> 3:09:44.640]  What's really behind that? And just break it down for us, William F. Jasper.
[3:09:44.640 --> 3:09:48.960]  Well, Alex, there are so many things that we see going on here. But one of the
[3:09:48.960 --> 3:09:52.720]  most striking things is that I've written about for many years,
[3:09:52.720 --> 3:09:56.720]  particularly since Rio de Janeiro,
[3:09:56.720 --> 3:10:03.200]  we're seeing now the culmination of an effort that was begun there.
[3:10:03.200 --> 3:10:07.040]  We know the name now NGO, Non-Governmental Organization.
[3:10:07.040 --> 3:10:12.480]  Back then, 17 and a half years ago in Rio, that was pretty much a newly invented
[3:10:12.480 --> 3:10:16.880]  term. But Rio was the first launch pad of the
[3:10:16.880 --> 3:10:22.160]  NGOs as a revolutionary parliamentary movement.
[3:10:22.160 --> 3:10:26.480]  They're really just UN spies that take over your local town.
[3:10:26.480 --> 3:10:30.960]  Well, yes, in all different kinds of areas. Of course, mostly with the Earth
[3:10:30.960 --> 3:10:33.520]  Summit. And with this one, we're talking about
[3:10:33.520 --> 3:10:37.600]  environmentalists, so-called environmentalist organization. At least
[3:10:37.600 --> 3:10:40.080]  that is the pretext of the things they think,
[3:10:40.080 --> 3:10:44.880]  concern for all things nature, the earth, the sky, the
[3:10:44.880 --> 3:10:48.320]  feathery, furry, little creatures, etc.
[3:10:48.320 --> 3:10:52.080]  And of course, many of the true believers, the
[3:10:52.080 --> 3:10:55.520]  foot soldiers out there, they do believe all this. But the people at the top, the
[3:10:55.520 --> 3:10:59.520]  more each strong. David Rocksell is just even Rocksellers.
[3:10:59.520 --> 3:11:04.000]  George Soros is the center who are funding all of these things and
[3:11:04.000 --> 3:11:08.160]  organizing and launching all these different groups.
[3:11:08.160 --> 3:11:11.840]  They have another agenda in mind, which is to use concern for the
[3:11:11.840 --> 3:11:16.000]  environment as a means of taking over more and more control of our economy,
[3:11:16.000 --> 3:11:20.000]  control of all aspects of our lives. Well, in
[3:11:20.000 --> 3:11:24.400]  Rio de Janeiro, we had around 20,000 to 30,000
[3:11:24.400 --> 3:11:28.880]  different NGO activists arrive there. And what was different there
[3:11:28.880 --> 3:11:34.880]  in Rio from today is, in Rio, all of these activists
[3:11:34.880 --> 3:11:38.480]  arrived there. This was part of the rental mob that the UN had
[3:11:38.480 --> 3:11:42.800]  brought there with all of its influence and money.
[3:11:42.800 --> 3:11:47.040]  That makes the UN look moderate. The UN is like, we're only socialists that want
[3:11:47.040 --> 3:11:50.640]  to tax you at 20%, and then all the communists waving red flags,
[3:11:50.640 --> 3:11:54.320]  literally, in fact, we'll roll some of that video in the background,
[3:11:54.320 --> 3:11:59.200]  they're calling for total government, destruction of all capitalism,
[3:11:59.200 --> 3:12:02.080]  so that allows the UN to look more moderate.
[3:12:02.080 --> 3:12:05.840]  Well, that's one of the functions. You certainly have a lot of the NGOs
[3:12:05.840 --> 3:12:09.280]  performing that function. Then you have other NGOs that take
[3:12:09.280 --> 3:12:13.040]  the more moderate socialist position. That is, although we're very reasonable,
[3:12:13.040 --> 3:12:18.160]  all we're asking for is what is there for the, in this case, mother earth, etc.
[3:12:18.160 --> 3:12:21.760]  And so you have a push-pull effect going on there.
[3:12:21.760 --> 3:12:26.160]  But in Rio, they were outside. They had their own village
[3:12:26.160 --> 3:12:29.440]  where they agitated from and carried on street theater
[3:12:29.440 --> 3:12:34.080]  and parades, etc. And then the UN was interacting with them.
[3:12:34.080 --> 3:12:38.160]  Maurice Strong and Gorbachev and Castro would go down to the village and whatnot.
[3:12:38.160 --> 3:12:43.520]  But since then, in 95 at Cairo and then 98 at
[3:12:43.520 --> 3:12:46.880]  Rome for the International Criminal Court and all of this,
[3:12:46.880 --> 3:12:51.520]  all of the UN summits since then, both environmental and human rights,
[3:12:51.520 --> 3:12:55.040]  and all of the other summits, they started bringing the NGOs
[3:12:55.040 --> 3:12:59.520]  actually into the UN where they, where their delegates came in almost on an
[3:12:59.520 --> 3:13:04.320]  equal footing or actually a superior footing to elected representatives.
[3:13:04.320 --> 3:13:07.600]  And how this works is the UN can then point
[3:13:07.600 --> 3:13:12.000]  at their employees and say, these are stakeholders, that's a key word when you
[3:13:12.000 --> 3:13:15.920]  hear that, for sustainability. What do the people want?
[3:13:15.920 --> 3:13:20.560]  We want world communism. And they go, that's what the people want.
[3:13:20.560 --> 3:13:25.120]  Exactly. This is the charade known as civil society.
[3:13:25.120 --> 3:13:28.640]  Every one of these people is called a stakeholder.
[3:13:28.640 --> 3:13:32.800]  That is, they hold some kind of stake in all of these
[3:13:32.800 --> 3:13:37.200]  goings on here. And they are supposedly
[3:13:37.200 --> 3:13:41.600]  representative of some sector of humanity or society. But of course,
[3:13:41.600 --> 3:13:44.960]  they're not elected by anyone. They are not accountable to anyone.
[3:13:44.960 --> 3:13:48.320]  Their funding is coming from the various governments.
[3:13:48.320 --> 3:13:51.520]  The biggest funders start out being the foundations,
[3:13:51.520 --> 3:13:55.120]  Ford Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation, Soros Foundation, etc.
[3:13:55.120 --> 3:13:58.400]  And then they quickly, they've taught these people how to then get on the
[3:13:58.400 --> 3:14:00.640]  government bill so that we're paying for it directly.
[3:14:00.640 --> 3:14:03.760]  That the UN, the EU, all the various EU
[3:14:03.760 --> 3:14:07.360]  individual governments, the US foreign aid government, the World Bank, the
[3:14:07.360 --> 3:14:11.920]  International Monetary Fund, are funding the thousands of NGO
[3:14:11.920 --> 3:14:16.480]  organizations to tune really billions of dollars a year. So they're using our
[3:14:16.480 --> 3:14:19.680]  tax dollars, the other taxpayers' dollars from around the world,
[3:14:19.680 --> 3:14:22.720]  to fund these people who are working against our interest.
[3:14:22.720 --> 3:14:28.080]  And a very good example of that. This was a completely closed,
[3:14:28.080 --> 3:14:34.320]  uninclusive, exclusive event here. You didn't see a single one of the
[3:14:34.320 --> 3:14:38.400]  major realist scientists or scientific organizations
[3:14:38.400 --> 3:14:42.400]  allowing... Let me interrupt you. Again, William F. Jasper, the editor of the
[3:14:42.400 --> 3:14:46.640]  New American Magazine, on with us from Copenhagen-Denmark, the last 48 hours
[3:14:46.640 --> 3:14:50.080]  of this global governance establishing event, because I want to get to
[3:14:50.080 --> 3:14:53.600]  not just the structure, but also are they successful this year
[3:14:53.600 --> 3:14:57.440]  in your eyes, or is this a failure in your take on Climate Gate and in your
[3:14:57.440 --> 3:15:01.040]  overall view on things. But take Lord Monkton. We interviewed
[3:15:01.040 --> 3:15:05.200]  Christopher Monkton last hour, the first hour of the show,
[3:15:05.200 --> 3:15:09.600]  and he talked about how he is a House of Lords member.
[3:15:09.600 --> 3:15:14.080]  So he had passes in, and the UN said, don't let him in,
[3:15:14.080 --> 3:15:18.080]  and when he... They started roughing him up, so he agreed to leave. When he turned
[3:15:18.080 --> 3:15:22.960]  around, the cop knocked him over, busted his head and leg open,
[3:15:22.960 --> 3:15:27.120]  and just laughed about it. And so they're now beating up members of the House of
[3:15:27.120 --> 3:15:30.240]  Lords. I mean, this guy's a royal, and they're beating him up,
[3:15:30.240 --> 3:15:33.680]  and usually the globalist groveled a royalty.
[3:15:33.680 --> 3:15:37.760]  Even though he had passes, that's how dictatorial these people are. This
[3:15:37.760 --> 3:15:41.360]  happened today. Well, right. See, I didn't even know about
[3:15:41.360 --> 3:15:45.040]  that. He was supposed to be coming here. We were going to interview him right
[3:15:45.040 --> 3:15:48.240]  outside the media center, which is inside
[3:15:48.240 --> 3:15:51.360]  the larger Bella Center here, where all this is taking place.
[3:15:51.360 --> 3:15:55.120]  And we were waiting for him, and his wife ended up calling,
[3:15:55.120 --> 3:15:58.000]  saying that he had tried to get in, but he couldn't get in.
[3:15:58.000 --> 3:16:04.640]  And that was the same with Mark Murano, who has a
[3:16:04.640 --> 3:16:08.240]  geo. He's accredited. He was supposed to have passes. They wouldn't allow him in.
[3:16:08.240 --> 3:16:12.320]  Even today, Senator Inhofe came here. Senator
[3:16:12.320 --> 3:16:16.880]  Mahoma, he's lead one in the U.S. Congress, opposing all of this, and
[3:16:16.880 --> 3:16:21.680]  here he's a senior member of Congress. He's the Vice
[3:16:21.680 --> 3:16:27.920]  Chairman of the Senate, Minority Chairman of the
[3:16:27.920 --> 3:16:31.760]  Senate Committee on Environment Public Works, that handles all of these.
[3:16:31.760 --> 3:16:35.200]  He's a, he's a, he's in the top 10 Republican leaders in the United
[3:16:35.200 --> 3:16:38.000]  States, a powerful U.S. Senator. Are you about to
[3:16:38.000 --> 3:16:42.800]  tell me he wasn't allowed in? He was allowed in, but they wouldn't give
[3:16:42.800 --> 3:16:46.240]  him a room to, I think your green piece,
[3:16:46.240 --> 3:16:50.080]  teams of yours, all of the rest of the environmentalist groups,
[3:16:50.080 --> 3:16:53.040]  they have rooms. They give, they give official presentations. They're giving
[3:16:53.040 --> 3:16:56.640]  great big panels and everything. They wouldn't allow him to do that.
[3:16:56.640 --> 3:17:01.280]  He had to come in here, give a, we couldn't even, and
[3:17:01.280 --> 3:17:06.240]  he had to stand on the stairs outside and give his
[3:17:06.240 --> 3:17:09.600]  short speech, and most of us couldn't even get out there,
[3:17:09.600 --> 3:17:12.720]  get him because they put up special security today
[3:17:12.720 --> 3:17:16.640]  in the hallway between our place and, and where I was. So they basically stuck
[3:17:16.640 --> 3:17:22.400]  Senator Inhofe in a free speech zone. True, and he, so he was, and he was only
[3:17:22.400 --> 3:17:27.360]  going to be here for a couple of months because he had votes in the Senate.
[3:17:27.360 --> 3:17:31.920]  So he arrived here and the very limited time that he had here,
[3:17:31.920 --> 3:17:36.480]  he couldn't even do anything. He just gave a statement. And then I taught his
[3:17:36.480 --> 3:17:42.480]  assistant, his chief staff, Matt Dempsey, and came around and handed out
[3:17:42.480 --> 3:17:49.040]  the printed copies of his statement. So that was, that was the, the, the voice
[3:17:49.040 --> 3:17:53.200]  of diversity here. They have, they, they wouldn't allow Senator Inhofe, and they
[3:17:53.200 --> 3:17:56.240]  wouldn't allow Lord Moncton, and they wouldn't allow
[3:17:56.240 --> 3:17:59.200]  Mark Murano. They want many of the other scientists who wanted to come here. They
[3:17:59.200 --> 3:18:03.280]  won't let them speak here. And so can you believe that they beat up
[3:18:03.280 --> 3:18:08.320]  Moncton? And then there's all these videos. I was completely unaware of that. I
[3:18:08.320 --> 3:18:11.360]  mean, that is just incredible because here,
[3:18:11.360 --> 3:18:15.200]  yesterday, I think they had literally thousands of these
[3:18:15.200 --> 3:18:19.840]  NGO ragnocon's in here, mostly high school and college kids
[3:18:19.840 --> 3:18:23.120]  that were, they're just here on a lark. Yes, they're, they're all passionate
[3:18:23.120 --> 3:18:27.360]  and everything. But they, but they, they, they allowed them to come in
[3:18:27.360 --> 3:18:31.120]  and actually stage demonstrations. And they had it sit down
[3:18:31.120 --> 3:18:34.560]  in the middle of the thoroughfare. They're blocking the way, holding up their
[3:18:34.560 --> 3:18:39.200]  signs on. That was fine. They let them. So, and all the media rushed to, to give
[3:18:39.200 --> 3:18:42.480]  them billions of dollars. Here you have all of the press from all over the
[3:18:42.480 --> 3:18:45.760]  world here, all the cameras and whatnot. So here,
[3:18:45.760 --> 3:18:48.720]  these kids who wouldn't even give their full name,
[3:18:48.720 --> 3:18:51.680]  they would just sit down there and they say, hold up signs saying,
[3:18:51.680 --> 3:18:55.280]  we, we're not leaving until we get an agreement that is fair,
[3:18:55.280 --> 3:19:00.720]  balanced and ambitious. And so somebody put these signs in their hands, told these
[3:19:00.720 --> 3:19:04.160]  kids to sit down there. They do it. They mouth these platitudes.
[3:19:04.160 --> 3:19:06.560]  They don't know what they're talking about. They can't give you any details
[3:19:06.560 --> 3:19:09.680]  about it. And, and they're giving billions of dollars
[3:19:09.680 --> 3:19:13.760]  worth of free publicity all over the world. They got. Yeah, that's a key point. I've
[3:19:13.760 --> 3:19:16.880]  been to some of these events too. And the rena mobs,
[3:19:16.880 --> 3:19:20.240]  when you really get a kid by themselves, a miner will run over and say, don't talk
[3:19:20.240 --> 3:19:23.360]  to them. And you'll find out, hey, I was just paid a hundred bucks.
[3:19:23.360 --> 3:19:27.440]  In fact, I believe I have that on video. We've been uploading the video because I,
[3:19:27.440 --> 3:19:31.920]  I, I interviewed some of them. I have them on video, but they would turn around
[3:19:31.920 --> 3:19:35.440]  when I would ask a question to say, well, who are you representing here? They turn
[3:19:35.440 --> 3:19:38.640]  around and look at this gal behind them who was
[3:19:38.640 --> 3:19:42.000]  running, wouldn't identify herself. Yeah, stay there. Let's talk more about
[3:19:42.000 --> 3:19:43.920]  that. And then the overall agenda, talk to your
[3:19:43.920 --> 3:19:49.120]  colleague as well. Alex Newman, who's with William F. Jasper,
[3:19:49.120 --> 3:19:53.280]  senior editor of the New American Magazine. Nice of them to join us from
[3:19:53.280 --> 3:19:55.600]  Copenhagen. We may end up keeping them most of the
[3:19:55.600 --> 3:19:59.840]  hour. They're busy guys though, because I want to get it into the overall agenda
[3:19:59.840 --> 3:20:03.120]  as well. Stay with us. We all know that the Berkey

[3:21:00.240 --> 3:21:05.280]  Are you tired of out of control, irresponsible federal deficit spending?
[3:21:05.280 --> 3:21:08.880]  Increasing the money supply without increasing productive output leads to
[3:21:08.880 --> 3:21:12.800]  inflation. You get less for your money. If you want to protect the buying power
[3:21:12.800 --> 3:21:17.200]  of dollars for your future, then call Peter May at Mitis Resources.
[3:21:17.200 --> 3:21:23.520]  800-686-2237 extension 135. You've worked hard for your dollars, don't
[3:21:23.520 --> 3:21:26.880]  let the government strip their buying power with wasteful spending.
[3:21:26.880 --> 3:21:31.600]  Gold has a 5,000 year track record as money. Real money you can count on.
[3:21:31.600 --> 3:21:36.080]  No government backed paper currency comes close. Ask me about the protection of
[3:21:36.080 --> 3:21:39.920]  private gold. Call Peter May at Mitis Resources.
[3:21:39.920 --> 3:21:47.440]  800-686-2237 extension 135. Central banks from around the world are stockpiling
[3:21:47.440 --> 3:21:52.320]  gold. They know gold is real money. Call Peter May at Mitis Resources.
[3:21:52.320 --> 3:21:59.280]  800-686-2237 extension 135 to discover the advantages of private
[3:21:59.280 --> 3:22:04.480]  protected gold. Hundreds of nations have fallen to
[3:22:04.480 --> 3:22:09.280]  tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last chance to not relive
[3:22:09.280 --> 3:22:12.080]  history. As we're finishing off this agenda,
[3:22:12.080 --> 3:22:15.120]  they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[3:22:15.120 --> 3:22:19.200]  I have tremendous influence on our president in Congress
[3:22:19.200 --> 3:22:23.920]  and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[3:22:23.920 --> 3:22:28.320]  as American citizens to pay attention. Fall of the Republic identifies the
[3:22:28.320 --> 3:22:31.840]  enemies of our nation. The criminal offshore cartel
[3:22:31.840 --> 3:22:35.920]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[3:22:35.920 --> 3:22:38.800]  government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[3:22:38.800 --> 3:22:42.080]  They're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[3:22:42.080 --> 3:22:45.280]  checkout to? Today seems like nobody does care and right
[3:22:45.280 --> 3:22:50.080]  now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[3:24:19.760 --> 3:24:30.640]  All right, we are back. William F. Jasper,
[3:24:30.640 --> 3:24:33.760]  Senior Editor of the New American, is our guest, Alex Newman.
[3:24:33.760 --> 3:24:38.160]  They're on the same phone standing by another investigative reporter.
[3:24:38.160 --> 3:24:42.000]  They travel there together. They're working together there.
[3:24:42.000 --> 3:24:49.840]  Look, Alex Newman is now there with us. Alex? Yes, sir.
[3:24:49.840 --> 3:24:53.840]  Give us your take on how the conference is going, kind of your snapshot
[3:24:53.840 --> 3:24:57.040]  of what's happening and how successful are the globalists
[3:24:57.040 --> 3:25:00.960]  at establishing their one-world government at this event?
[3:25:00.960 --> 3:25:05.200]  Well, so far they keep having all these little spats where they're pretending
[3:25:05.200 --> 3:25:09.200]  that the conference is dead and they're stalled and all these different things
[3:25:09.200 --> 3:25:13.120]  because some group of dictators isn't going to get the amount of wealth redistribution
[3:25:13.120 --> 3:25:15.360]  that they want from the so-called rich countries.
[3:25:15.360 --> 3:25:20.240]  So, there's this big theater that the talks keep getting stalled and so forth,
[3:25:20.240 --> 3:25:23.920]  but overall it seems that they're making progress.
[3:25:23.920 --> 3:25:28.880]  China has been making a sink earlier because not enough people wanted to give
[3:25:28.880 --> 3:25:32.400]  money to the developing countries, so they weren't happy with any of the
[3:25:32.400 --> 3:25:35.360]  texts that were coming out of that and they were thinking of offering a counter
[3:25:35.360 --> 3:25:39.120]  proposal. But so far, they seem to be advancing.
[3:25:39.120 --> 3:25:43.600]  There's been a couple of the draft texts released. I was reporting on
[3:25:43.600 --> 3:25:46.800]  one that was called the Danish text that was released some time ago,
[3:25:46.800 --> 3:25:52.640]  which was talking about taxing, airline travel, various shipping operations,
[3:25:52.640 --> 3:25:56.480]  and so then you would have the UN with its own revenue stream.
[3:25:56.480 --> 3:26:01.200]  And its own enforcement, its own travel authority, 2% tax right off the top of
[3:26:01.200 --> 3:26:06.160]  all GDPs, a true global government. Do the latest agreements look like the
[3:26:06.160 --> 3:26:10.480]  Danish text? They've been taking things out and adding
[3:26:10.480 --> 3:26:13.920]  things in, but it seems that the basic framework is
[3:26:13.920 --> 3:26:17.680]  that's what they're going for, to have some kind of taxation mechanism
[3:26:17.680 --> 3:26:20.320]  where they can raise their own income. Okay, that is bad news.
[3:26:20.320 --> 3:26:24.560]  So, and that's what Lord Monkton was saying, that it looks like they're just
[3:26:24.560 --> 3:26:30.800]  acting like they're playing possum, but really it looks like they may get it.
[3:26:30.800 --> 3:26:34.560]  Yes, it does. Where it looks like it's moving towards now, everybody's talking
[3:26:34.560 --> 3:26:38.320]  about that, oh, the whole world is depending on this moment right now,
[3:26:38.320 --> 3:26:41.520]  and we need to make one final push to get a tough agreement through.
[3:26:41.520 --> 3:26:45.200]  And so that's basically the atmosphere around here. And if you talk to just
[3:26:45.200 --> 3:26:48.080]  about anybody around here, that's kind of where they're standing.
[3:26:48.080 --> 3:26:51.520]  They want to see some tough news. And you've got a bunch of bought-off
[3:26:51.520 --> 3:26:54.480]  third-world countries under IMF and World Bank Control.
[3:26:54.480 --> 3:26:57.520]  And so it doesn't matter if their populations don't want it, they're
[3:26:57.520 --> 3:27:01.440]  still going to go along with it. You've got Obama that's going to sign on to it.
[3:27:01.440 --> 3:27:06.080]  I mean, is there any way to stop this? Well, communist China has some
[3:27:06.080 --> 3:27:09.520]  interesting ideas about it. They want to have some kind of population control
[3:27:09.520 --> 3:27:14.000]  mechanisms and these kind of things. And so the latest word around here earlier
[3:27:14.000 --> 3:27:17.840]  this afternoon was that they were threatening to try to derail the talks
[3:27:17.840 --> 3:27:23.920]  and end it with a proposal. But so far, we just have to see and, you know...
[3:27:23.920 --> 3:27:27.680]  Well, hold on, hold on. We've got, again, a reporter with the New America there,
[3:27:27.680 --> 3:27:32.000]  Alex Newman, and I want to go back for the break to Mr. Jasper. This is big news here.
[3:27:32.000 --> 3:27:36.160]  Give us the meat of what you're saying. The Chinese are threatening to derail
[3:27:36.160 --> 3:27:39.600]  things if a global one-child policy isn't signed on to?
[3:27:40.800 --> 3:27:42.880]  Well, I'm not sure about all of that, but they've...
[3:27:42.880 --> 3:27:45.280]  Well, that's what they called for on Monday, but you're saying...
[3:27:45.280 --> 3:27:49.680]  Yeah. That's one of the things that they've been hoping to have is some kind of
[3:27:49.680 --> 3:27:55.040]  global population control and... Holy mackerel! You're saying that may be added in?
[3:27:55.040 --> 3:27:56.960]  I mean, they're actually talking about getting that in there?
[3:27:58.080 --> 3:28:00.640]  Well, I don't know about that, but we talked to the congressman today,
[3:28:00.640 --> 3:28:06.240]  Congressman Markey, who wrote the bill with Congressman Waxman of the climate change bill
[3:28:06.240 --> 3:28:10.400]  that came out of the House of Representatives. And we asked him about, you know, why are we
[3:28:10.400 --> 3:28:14.960]  negotiating with China? They're talking about global population control and, you know,
[3:28:14.960 --> 3:28:19.120]  things that are totally repugnant to the US Constitution and to the US way of life.
[3:28:19.120 --> 3:28:25.680]  And his answer was, oh, everybody has to pursue their own strategies to tackle the climate issue
[3:28:25.680 --> 3:28:29.680]  and this kind of stuff. So, it doesn't look like there's going to be a lot of opposition
[3:28:29.680 --> 3:28:34.160]  to it, at least from this group. Well, China owns most of our debt. I mean,
[3:28:34.160 --> 3:28:37.280]  they're the biggest owner of our debt, and we're told they're the new superpower.
[3:28:37.280 --> 3:28:39.600]  They really are the model for this new world order.
[3:28:40.480 --> 3:28:44.800]  Yeah, they have a lot of influence there, and everybody's been talking about China, you know.
[3:28:44.800 --> 3:28:48.720]  How can we get China to cooperate? Oh, we all need to bow down to China's demand,
[3:28:48.720 --> 3:28:52.400]  because it's going to walk out. And we're not going to get the global agreement that we need,
[3:28:52.400 --> 3:28:57.120]  so we need to figure out how to work with China so we can get this accomplished. So,
[3:28:57.120 --> 3:29:01.520]  that's definitely not good news. Your listeners know anything about the Chinese government.
[3:29:02.320 --> 3:29:06.560]  So, since the Danish text, have you gotten any other of the latest versions?
[3:29:08.160 --> 3:29:12.800]  I haven't read through any of the actual drafts, but there's been hints flying around.
[3:29:12.800 --> 3:29:17.760]  But it's been a lot of just tweaking with the numbers. You know, should we cap carbon dioxide
[3:29:17.760 --> 3:29:25.840]  emissions by 45% or should it be 30% and should the funding mechanism be $100 billion or $150 billion?
[3:29:25.840 --> 3:29:30.320]  So, they're debating whether to put five bullets in our heart or 10 bullets?
[3:29:30.320 --> 3:29:33.440]  Pretty much, yeah. That's what it looks like it's going towards.
[3:29:34.000 --> 3:29:37.760]  Are they going to beat us in the head with the baseball bat 20 times or 40 times? You know.
[3:29:38.480 --> 3:29:42.560]  At a certain point, what does it matter? Stay there, Alex Newman. We're going to come back,
[3:29:42.560 --> 3:29:46.480]  and I got some questions for William F. Jasper. Then I'll go back to you. Take a few calls.
[3:29:46.480 --> 3:29:50.080]  They join us from Copenhagen, Denmark. We'll also get their websites.
[3:29:51.520 --> 3:29:58.240]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:30:00.880 --> 3:30:05.120]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Akola Blue atmospheric water generator that
[3:30:05.120 --> 3:30:09.200]  produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air. No, this isn't science fiction.
[3:30:09.200 --> 3:30:13.600]  It's very real. I know because I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to
[3:30:13.600 --> 3:30:17.840]  you. Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Akola Blue, you'll know what's in

[3:30:55.120 --> 3:31:03.040]  on the web at www.ecoloblu.com today. This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[3:31:03.040 --> 3:31:08.160]  consider buying a solar power generator. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double
[3:31:08.160 --> 3:31:13.360]  or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your
[3:31:13.360 --> 3:31:18.640]  electric company allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name
[3:31:18.640 --> 3:31:23.920]  of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is
[3:31:23.920 --> 3:31:29.200]  dangerously overloaded. And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[3:31:29.200 --> 3:31:34.320]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families
[3:31:34.320 --> 3:31:38.880]  lose their power from weather-related onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides
[3:31:38.880 --> 3:31:43.520]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators
[3:31:43.520 --> 3:31:47.840]  offered by Solutions from Science, one of my old sponsors. You can get more information at
[3:31:47.840 --> 3:31:54.560]  www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com. Remember, the government doesn't own the sun,

[3:32:00.080 --> 3:32:06.480]  Hi, folks. This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator. Now,
[3:32:06.480 --> 3:32:11.600]  you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the blood
[3:32:11.600 --> 3:32:16.880]  stream by breathing the solution through the lungs. The respiratory system is the first line
[3:32:16.880 --> 3:32:22.480]  of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses. The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory
[3:32:22.480 --> 3:32:29.280]  system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles
[3:32:29.280 --> 3:32:34.400]  instantly into the bloodstream. With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver
[3:32:34.400 --> 3:32:40.720]  products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[3:32:40.720 --> 3:32:46.160]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[3:32:46.160 --> 3:32:52.560]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver
[3:32:52.560 --> 3:33:00.320]  Lungs Generator. That's www.silverlungs.com.
[3:33:04.320 --> 3:33:07.520]  A lot of people worry that what you're going to wind up with is hash. There's even some
[3:33:07.520 --> 3:33:12.320]  Democrats saying, now we've got a bill that's so compromised that it's not worth signing.
[3:33:12.960 --> 3:33:18.560]  If we don't pass it, here's the guarantee. Your premiums will go up. Your employers are going to
[3:33:18.560 --> 3:33:22.640]  load up more costs on you. Potentially, they're going to drop your coverage because they just can't
[3:33:22.640 --> 3:33:27.280]  afford an increase of 25, 30 percent in terms of the cost of providing health care to employees
[3:33:27.280 --> 3:33:33.360]  each and every year. And the federal government will go bankrupt because Medicare and Medicaid are
[3:33:33.360 --> 3:33:39.680]  on a trajectory that are unsustainable. And this actually provides us the best chance of starting
[3:33:39.680 --> 3:33:45.440]  to bend the cost curve on the government expenditures in Medicare and Medicaid. So
[3:33:45.440 --> 3:33:52.160]  talk about deception. They're not just trying to grab old resources and tax carbon dioxide
[3:33:52.160 --> 3:33:58.800]  involved in all human and animal and industrial activity. Remember, they said they had to have
[3:33:58.800 --> 3:34:02.880]  the trillions of dollars with the banker bailout or we'd have a depression. Then they said, oh,
[3:34:02.880 --> 3:34:07.040]  we're going to keep the money and not tell you where it went. And now we're going to have a
[3:34:07.040 --> 3:34:12.400]  bankrupt government. If we don't raise all the taxes and cut your Medicare and Medicaid, see,
[3:34:12.400 --> 3:34:18.000]  once the bankers get you dependent, they then start increasing the taxes and cutting back
[3:34:18.000 --> 3:34:23.680]  the domestication feed, the chicken feed. They're done feeding the hog. You've been fattened up.
[3:34:23.680 --> 3:34:30.240]  Now they're going to eat you. And going back to William F. Jasper of the New American Magazine
[3:34:30.240 --> 3:34:35.360]  and Alex Newman also writes the New American Magazine in Copenhagen. We just got the bad
[3:34:35.360 --> 3:34:40.800]  news from Alex and I respect his view, but I want to get your view. Monkton is saying
[3:34:40.800 --> 3:34:45.760]  they're not going to call it a treaty so they don't have to ratify it in different nations,
[3:34:46.480 --> 3:34:51.600]  but that it's going to bring the bureaucracy in to start all the taxes, but that they won't get
[3:34:51.600 --> 3:34:57.920]  everything they asked for, but that they're having somewhat of a success here. He was talking
[3:34:57.920 --> 3:35:04.000]  about the Danish text and other things. What is the sense of the research you're doing there on
[3:35:04.000 --> 3:35:08.720]  the ground? Is this a victory for the globalist, for the Rothschilds, for the Rockefellers?
[3:35:08.720 --> 3:35:15.280]  Well, Alex, I can go by my past experience. I've been at enough of these summits. It's
[3:35:16.400 --> 3:35:21.840]  the same at every one of them. You have all of this ambition, everything coming into it,
[3:35:21.840 --> 3:35:26.320]  and they got all the leaders of the world, and already as they start the summit, there's bickering
[3:35:26.320 --> 3:35:30.480]  over text. You have all these different bracketed texts. You'll hear them talking about bracketed
[3:35:30.480 --> 3:35:38.000]  texts. That's because different parties to the treaty have all different kinds of ideas about
[3:35:38.000 --> 3:35:44.000]  whether to put the reductions at 10% or 20% or 50% are contributions for reparations.
[3:35:45.440 --> 3:35:50.240]  How many billion won? There's all these differences of opinion as to how much they're
[3:35:50.240 --> 3:35:55.840]  going to tax us to death and how fast, and those types of things that the one world is in the
[3:35:55.840 --> 3:36:01.600]  leftist just can't get all their deductions. Of course, all the reparations don't go to
[3:36:01.600 --> 3:36:05.760]  starving Africans for the deadly carbon dioxide. No, no, it all goes to Maurice Strong.
[3:36:05.760 --> 3:36:13.600]  Right. It always goes to the dictators, and the bankers, those who are running the show.
[3:36:15.280 --> 3:36:21.840]  What happens at these summits is you have all of this chaos and confusion going on and
[3:36:22.560 --> 3:36:28.240]  hassling and haggling back and forth, and then midways through it, they say, oh, it's a crisis
[3:36:28.240 --> 3:36:35.360]  there. We're not going to get this through. It's the same thing in Rome. We're bringing about the
[3:36:35.360 --> 3:36:39.440]  international criminal court. I said at the beginning, I was doing interviews by radio from
[3:36:39.440 --> 3:36:43.600]  that. I said, well, they're saying that they're not going to get the court they want, and it's
[3:36:43.600 --> 3:36:47.600]  going to all crash down. So what they do is they start putting on the pressure, and they start
[3:36:47.600 --> 3:36:52.640]  bringing all the big guns at that time built, and then all the other. So that's, I mean,
[3:36:52.640 --> 3:36:58.160]  it's a shake and make operation. It's like making pancakes out of a box. They use reverse psychology
[3:36:58.160 --> 3:37:02.720]  of getting everybody there, building up expectations, then saying too bad we failed,
[3:37:02.720 --> 3:37:07.200]  so then all the smaller parties want to sign on to feel like they were part of history.
[3:37:07.920 --> 3:37:12.400]  Right. Just watch here. They're going to be saying, you'll be seeing this. They'll say,
[3:37:12.400 --> 3:37:18.400]  the world is watching. We have to do this. The world is calling on us. We've let this go for
[3:37:18.400 --> 3:37:24.160]  all these years. Kyoto and all of this. Rio in 92. It's time. This is the time. That's what they've
[3:37:24.160 --> 3:37:29.520]  been saying here. They start putting the pressure on. That's what they do. That's the pressure
[3:37:29.520 --> 3:37:34.160]  that you can see. Behind the scenes, they're doing all kinds of broadening and arm twisting about
[3:37:34.160 --> 3:37:39.200]  all these countries that owed debt and all these the ones that want to get access to new debt.
[3:37:39.200 --> 3:37:43.120]  So they're buying off and bribing all the politicians and whatnot. And so by the end of
[3:37:43.920 --> 3:37:48.960]  the day on Friday or early Saturday morning, I believe they're going to announce an agreement.
[3:37:48.960 --> 3:37:52.400]  It's not going to be what they want. And of course, it's not something that would pass
[3:37:52.400 --> 3:37:59.440]  muster in the U.S. Senate, even as bad as the Senate is right now. But what they want to do, what they
[3:37:59.440 --> 3:38:07.120]  know they have to do, is get an agreement that they can grab, that will qualify as what they call
[3:38:07.120 --> 3:38:13.440]  soft law. I first started writing about this back in 1990 and then after the Earth Summit,
[3:38:13.440 --> 3:38:17.760]  because they started announcing they could call it soft law. It's not really a treaty. It doesn't
[3:38:17.760 --> 3:38:22.720]  really have teeth in it. But the teeth are hidden way back there. And pretty soon we'll
[3:38:22.720 --> 3:38:28.480]  start adding institutions to it. And all of the judges and the attorneys and the politicians
[3:38:28.480 --> 3:38:33.920]  will keep talking about it, how we have this commitment and we have this obligation. And
[3:38:33.920 --> 3:38:38.960]  pretty soon it will become customary law, international law. And then we'll start adding
[3:38:38.960 --> 3:38:43.680]  other institutions onto it. And here's my biggest issue. Exactly. I mean, you're getting really
[3:38:43.680 --> 3:38:48.800]  stunning information from William S. Jasper. And I've got to get you back on once you get back
[3:38:48.800 --> 3:38:55.280]  in the U.S. on a landline to go over all this. But how then does the NGOs and Schwarzenegger come
[3:38:55.280 --> 3:39:00.160]  in? Because he's saying, we're going to have a governor's meeting, a city's meeting. I'm going
[3:39:00.160 --> 3:39:06.240]  to head it for the U.N. The U.N. says, yes, you are. And that we'll just bypass Congress. I mean,
[3:39:06.240 --> 3:39:12.400]  that is seditious. Schwarzenegger. I mean, this guy. It's completely subversive. I mean,
[3:39:12.400 --> 3:39:17.920]  he's taken a note to the U.S. Constitution, as well as to the California Constitution.
[3:39:17.920 --> 3:39:24.560]  And he's totally subverting the whole constitutional process and violating his oath.
[3:39:25.760 --> 3:39:32.960]  It's completely contrary to our whole system and ethic of government. So,
[3:39:34.560 --> 3:39:40.720]  yeah, what they're doing is, in this whole process, just like creating these stakeholders
[3:39:40.720 --> 3:39:45.520]  in civil society, it's really a form of the old Soviets and the Soviet Union. They had these
[3:39:45.520 --> 3:39:50.560]  Soviets, that's where they got from the circle, the Soviets, where they would bring the communists,
[3:39:50.560 --> 3:39:57.120]  bring together the doctors, no lawyers, and the students, and the intellectuals. And none of
[3:39:57.120 --> 3:40:05.040]  these people really represented all the rest of the intellectuals or the doctors or the lawyers.
[3:40:05.040 --> 3:40:10.880]  It's gangs. It's gangs they decide to give power who literally operate as their agents.
[3:40:11.680 --> 3:40:17.600]  Yes. And so that's what they're doing here. It's a total farce only. It's a very deadly one.
[3:40:18.320 --> 3:40:24.240]  And, you know, there's all of this. What's at stake here is, of course, not just the
[3:40:24.240 --> 3:40:30.480]  trillions of dollars. I wrote a story recently. You know, we're talking about here at the conference
[3:40:30.480 --> 3:40:38.960]  of $100 billion of reparations for the North to the South, but the UNEP, the United Nations,
[3:40:38.960 --> 3:40:48.400]  that's an environmental program, calls for $45 trillion as the debt. And Ban Ki-moon said $20
[3:40:48.400 --> 3:40:54.080]  trillion. And, by the way, I'm sure you've seen this, but Ban Ki-moon gave an LA Times
[3:40:54.080 --> 3:40:59.520]  article interview, and he said, we will enforce global governance on you, whether you like it or
[3:40:59.520 --> 3:41:02.320]  not. These guys are really getting arrogant.
[3:41:04.560 --> 3:41:10.800]  Totally. And as everything we've discussed here shows, they don't believe they have to allow
[3:41:10.800 --> 3:41:17.040]  anyone to voice any other opinion, have any other representation here. They totally are going to,
[3:41:18.160 --> 3:41:23.120]  they would have kept us out if they could have. They've tried almost every time I've gone. I've
[3:41:23.120 --> 3:41:27.520]  been covering at the United Nations for nearly 30 years, covering many of each UN summit.
[3:41:27.520 --> 3:41:35.120]  And almost every time, they try to keep me out. And usually I have to get kind of nasty and start
[3:41:35.120 --> 3:41:39.680]  raising my voice and causing a great big stir, and then they say, okay, and they let me come in.
[3:41:41.040 --> 3:41:45.760]  You know, I haven't found anybody else here. I have found a couple of others who were able
[3:41:45.760 --> 3:41:49.920]  to slide by and get in here, but not very many. Everybody else is part of the choir
[3:41:49.920 --> 3:41:58.800]  or bring on the global government. And no question about any of the climate gate. Alex
[3:41:58.800 --> 3:42:02.320]  will get into you with the climate gate. He's been working on a couple of stories on that.
[3:42:03.360 --> 3:42:10.160]  But as you all know, what we're talking about here is unprecedented in terms of the grasp of
[3:42:10.160 --> 3:42:14.800]  power. Here they're saying they want to regulate the air you breathe, every breath you take,
[3:42:14.800 --> 3:42:18.800]  every move you make. And that's part of one of the things that I brought back from
[3:42:18.800 --> 3:42:24.240]  Rio de Janeiro. I think I was the first one to ever write about it or speak. I went on a speaking
[3:42:24.240 --> 3:42:31.120]  tour and I held it up as I went around the country Agenda 21. And it's a huge 802,000 page,
[3:42:31.120 --> 3:42:38.240]  depending on the version, a global master plan of the United Nations for the 21st century. And
[3:42:39.280 --> 3:42:44.480]  it says in there, and I quoted it verbatim, this is a plan that's going to affect every person on
[3:42:44.480 --> 3:42:51.600]  earth. It's going to affect every aspect of your life. We have plans here for businessmen and
[3:42:51.600 --> 3:42:56.960]  students and doctors and lawyers and farmers and ranchers and manufacturers and steel workers.
[3:42:56.960 --> 3:43:02.240]  They list every possible person in occupation. They say this is going to affect every part of
[3:43:02.240 --> 3:43:10.160]  the planet from deserts to tundra to forest to prairies to mountains to streams and lakes and
[3:43:10.160 --> 3:43:15.760]  ponds and virtually everything. Well, I mean, that is the issue now is that before it was
[3:43:15.760 --> 3:43:20.400]  global government, but they were covert. Now they come out and say, we run the whole planet.
[3:43:20.400 --> 3:43:26.240]  Humans are bad. We want to bankrupt industrial societies. And if you try to come to our meetings,
[3:43:26.240 --> 3:43:32.640]  we beat you up. I mean, these are open tyrants. They know their tyrants. They've got, you know,
[3:43:32.640 --> 3:43:39.440]  18 year old rena mobs. They give $100 a day to run around and, you know, act foolish. But here it is.
[3:43:39.440 --> 3:43:44.720]  But William F. Jasper in your decades of fighting these people, do you see us beginning to gain
[3:43:44.720 --> 3:43:49.680]  momentum? The pendulum beginning to slow and it's swing towards tyranny. That's why they're
[3:43:49.680 --> 3:43:55.520]  trying to come out in the open now and force it and finish their agenda because major cracks
[3:43:55.520 --> 3:43:59.040]  in the foundation of their system are appearing. Or are you more pessimistic?
[3:43:59.920 --> 3:44:06.640]  No, I, you know, I, I'm optimistic in that. And I think this, this what we've seen in the
[3:44:06.640 --> 3:44:13.760]  last couple of months verified by the Grasmussen poll and the Pew poll and the CBS poll showing
[3:44:13.760 --> 3:44:22.400]  the plummeting support for, for any kind of climate change legislation, the belief in
[3:44:22.960 --> 3:44:28.800]  AGW and genetic global warming as a crisis. All of that has been crashing down faster than
[3:44:28.800 --> 3:44:38.640]  our great scientist Al Gore's credibility. And, and that's because people still have more
[3:44:38.640 --> 3:44:45.360]  common sense than the elitist. Well, plus, plus the system is so discredited now. I mean,
[3:44:45.360 --> 3:44:50.560]  it doesn't matter what party it is, where it is in the world, people are finally getting that healthy
[3:44:51.760 --> 3:44:56.880]  mistrust of government. Right. And it has to, that has to increase a great deal more because
[3:44:56.880 --> 3:45:02.720]  they recognize that people are, are getting wise to them. And so that's why they're pushing so
[3:45:02.720 --> 3:45:09.520]  arrogantly and adamantly now, because if they keep, they keep losing if you and I and others are
[3:45:09.520 --> 3:45:14.320]  able to continue waking people up, they're just not going to get it through. And so they're,
[3:45:14.320 --> 3:45:18.240]  they're, they're, they're really panicky about that, that what they had, they've invested so
[3:45:18.240 --> 3:45:24.720]  much over these last 20 years to push this whole environmental charade that, you know,
[3:45:24.720 --> 3:45:31.920]  it could, it could melt like a ice cream cone here in Al Gore's movies. So they're, they're
[3:45:31.920 --> 3:45:37.840]  really concerned about that. And they have a right to even before climate game, most of the polls
[3:45:37.840 --> 3:45:45.840]  were already showing this collapse of belief in, in the crisis and the apocalypse that they're,
[3:45:45.840 --> 3:45:50.160]  they're claiming is coming. And you and I both know, look, they're, they're saying they want to
[3:45:50.160 --> 3:45:55.920]  re-engineer all of society. You have guys like one of the big gurus of, of global warming,
[3:45:55.920 --> 3:46:00.960]  Clive Hamilton, professor from, from Australia. And he says, this is a time where it calls
[3:46:00.960 --> 3:46:07.280]  worry, emergency measures. We have to talk about suspending democratic processes. You have guys
[3:46:07.280 --> 3:46:13.360]  like George Monbiott say, we need to issue a ration card for every person on the planet. You get
[3:46:13.360 --> 3:46:22.320]  only so much CO2 and you can ration. And you have John P. Holdren writing a textbook about
[3:46:22.320 --> 3:46:27.360]  putting sterilence in the water. And now Fox News is calling for putting lithium in the water
[3:46:27.360 --> 3:46:32.560]  to make the public more well behaved. I mean, we are living in the twilight zone and they can
[3:46:32.560 --> 3:46:38.080]  normalize insanity if we don't say no. Look at the Nazi culture. Look at the Aztec culture.
[3:46:38.080 --> 3:46:42.800]  They're, they're, they're, it's encouraging that people are waking up saying, saying no to this
[3:46:42.800 --> 3:46:48.160]  in spite of the fact that we have the media. So, so heavily controlled by people who are promoting
[3:46:48.160 --> 3:46:55.520]  this. But it's, it's galloping out very quickly. And so we've got to sell the wakeup process.
[3:46:55.520 --> 3:46:59.280]  Well, guys, we're almost out of time. And I wanted to turn you back over to Alex. So he
[3:46:59.280 --> 3:47:04.720]  can, but, but, but before you do that, William, William there. I'm here. Yeah. No, I, I, before
[3:47:04.720 --> 3:47:09.600]  we do that, I wanted to thank you for coming on with us and you're talking about uploading videos.
[3:47:09.600 --> 3:47:14.400]  Can we see these videos that these reports you guys have filed? And if so, where are they posted?
[3:47:14.400 --> 3:47:22.880]  We already have some of them available on thenewamerican.com or at JPS.org. Either one of those.
[3:47:22.880 --> 3:47:27.280]  And I've, we've been doing it. So running back and forth, shooting photos, doing interviews,
[3:47:27.280 --> 3:47:30.880]  uploading. So I haven't had a chance to even check to see how many of them are up there yet,
[3:47:30.880 --> 3:47:36.320]  but a number of them are. You can see, for instance, our, our one on the anti-nuclear
[3:47:37.600 --> 3:47:44.800]  one that went up today. It's called the demonstrate NGO demonstrators, no coal, no oil, no nuclear.
[3:47:44.800 --> 3:47:49.920]  And you can see some of the random mob that's here. They wouldn't allow monks in there, but
[3:47:50.560 --> 3:47:55.120]  many of these qualified PhDs and scientists want to, but they allow these, these folks to come in.
[3:47:55.120 --> 3:47:59.760]  And if you go on the website that I show you there, you see, they have outright communist parties
[3:47:59.760 --> 3:48:04.240]  with kind of communist flags, hammer and sickles as part of their coalition. They're allowed to come
[3:48:04.240 --> 3:48:10.480]  in here. And the good guys aren't. Absolutely. Well, good talking to you. And we'll talk to you
[3:48:10.480 --> 3:48:15.760]  again soon. Let me talk to Alex now. Alex, we only got a few minutes left in this segment.
[3:48:15.760 --> 3:48:18.640]  I'm going to let you, I'll turn you over to Alex. Thanks so much. Thank you. You bet.
[3:48:19.840 --> 3:48:25.200]  Thank you. Hey, how's it going? Good. Go ahead. And in the last couple minutes,
[3:48:25.200 --> 3:48:30.960]  we have any other key points you want to relate to the audience. Alex Newman from the global
[3:48:30.960 --> 3:48:36.320]  government summit. Yeah. Well, the one thing that I've found is the most incredible is you have this
[3:48:36.320 --> 3:48:41.440]  800 pound gorilla in the room, which is climate gate, of course. And just about everybody here,
[3:48:41.440 --> 3:48:45.440]  at least knows what it is. Some of them don't know exactly what it's about because they've
[3:48:45.440 --> 3:48:50.880]  already dismissed it because it contradicts the global warming space. But it's just incredible.
[3:48:50.880 --> 3:48:55.360]  I've been talking to just about everybody I meet about it and journalists in particular,
[3:48:55.360 --> 3:48:59.520]  and that's where I've been getting the most interesting answers. I've met one journalist
[3:48:59.520 --> 3:49:04.640]  out of dozens and dozens that I've spoken with who's filed a story related to climate
[3:49:04.640 --> 3:49:12.320]  gate. She interviewed one of the IPCC people on a switcher in the national radio about climate
[3:49:12.320 --> 3:49:16.240]  gate. And of course, he just went on there and said, oh, it's no big deal. The science has settled
[3:49:16.240 --> 3:49:20.880]  and that's just a side issue of destruction. But I also talked to some of the congresspeople that
[3:49:20.880 --> 3:49:24.320]  were here in Nancy Pelosi who was here as soon as she answered one of my questions. And then as
[3:49:24.320 --> 3:49:27.680]  soon as I asked her about climate gate, she turned away and pretended she didn't hear it.
[3:49:29.440 --> 3:49:32.800]  I asked Charlie Wrangle, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee,
[3:49:32.800 --> 3:49:36.800]  powerful congressman about climate gate. And he looked at me a bit puzzled and just said,
[3:49:36.800 --> 3:49:40.560]  no, no, no, we're just here to support the process. And of course, the science has settled.
[3:49:40.560 --> 3:49:46.000]  So it's just been across the board, everybody you talk to just about,
[3:49:46.960 --> 3:49:51.760]  just uses the same mantra over and over again. The science has settled. You can't ask questions.
[3:49:51.760 --> 3:49:57.440]  But it's even come out within the last two days. Now, the Russian Institute of Economic Analysis,
[3:49:57.440 --> 3:50:01.760]  I believe it's called, has been calling doubt on the figures used by the Hadley office
[3:50:01.760 --> 3:50:06.240]  and at the Met Office in England, which is supposed to be the other reputable scientific
[3:50:06.240 --> 3:50:12.400]  place to prove global warming. And it turns out now they've used, I think only 25% of the
[3:50:12.400 --> 3:50:16.880]  weather stations that were provided to them from Russia's territory. And of course,
[3:50:16.880 --> 3:50:21.600]  they use the ones that showed their hypothesis to be correct, that there's warming. And they
[3:50:21.600 --> 3:50:26.640]  ignored the other 75%, which either didn't show significant warming or didn't show warming at
[3:50:26.640 --> 3:50:34.400]  all. So you have just this horrible farce of a science, pretend science, and nobody is willing
[3:50:34.400 --> 3:50:39.920]  to talk about it. So it's just, like I said, the elephant in the room. And nobody wants to address
[3:50:39.920 --> 3:50:44.400]  it. So hopefully, with shows like yours, we can just keep getting the word out, you know, we
[3:50:44.400 --> 3:50:49.120]  are exposing these frauds. And if we stand up and rebuke them and decide that we're supposed
[3:50:49.120 --> 3:50:53.680]  to be involved in society for good, we can stop them. Alex Newman from Copenhagen, thank you for
[3:50:53.680 --> 3:51:00.000]  spending time with us. Godspeed. Thank you. Final segment straight ahead. Key information stay with
[3:51:00.000 --> 3:51:05.520]  us. This is Alex Jones. And I want to tell you about the Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator

[3:52:02.640 --> 3:52:08.240]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last chance
[3:52:08.240 --> 3:52:13.440]  to not relive history. As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from
[3:52:13.440 --> 3:52:18.160]  underneath the Americans at home. They have turned a tremendous influence on our president and
[3:52:18.160 --> 3:52:24.720]  Congress. And they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[3:52:24.720 --> 3:52:29.840]  citizens to pay attention. Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation. The
[3:52:29.840 --> 3:52:35.920]  criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[3:52:35.920 --> 3:52:40.960]  government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches. And the Congress
[3:52:40.960 --> 3:52:45.680]  is saying, who do we make the checkout to? Today seems like nobody does care. And right now in
[3:52:45.680 --> 3:52:52.160]  Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic

[3:53:58.240 --> 3:54:02.880]  right now. Right now. Right now. Past the point of talking, we know historically that the global
[3:54:02.880 --> 3:54:09.280]  governance sort of agenda to these issues is very hard to try. And with all the best intentions,
[3:54:09.280 --> 3:54:13.680]  it's very hard to actually activate. We're seeing that right now. We're seeing a lot of fragmentation
[3:54:13.680 --> 3:54:18.000]  going on in Copenhagen. A lot of different agendas pulling in different directions. And I think what
[3:54:18.000 --> 3:54:22.720]  we really need to see is people on the ground starting to actually act upon the low hanging
[3:54:22.720 --> 3:54:29.120]  fruit and start to try and move on the solutions that we have at hand. In case you missed it.
[3:54:29.120 --> 3:54:50.960]  Colonel Jackson is coming for you, Rothschild.
[3:54:50.960 --> 3:54:59.680]  Monday through Friday, from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central, we're here live back Sundays, 4 to 6 p.m.
[3:55:02.160 --> 3:55:08.400]  And I wasn't live last Sunday. I will be live this Sunday. And the Sunday after that.
[3:55:13.360 --> 3:55:17.120]  I meant to get the calls. We just ran out of time with those two reporters with so much info.
[3:55:17.120 --> 3:55:21.440]  Tomorrow we've got other big guests joining us and same thing on Sunday into next week.
[3:55:22.800 --> 3:55:26.880]  Here's some of the crazy news I've got in front of me. Now, we already knew this.
[3:55:26.880 --> 3:55:30.960]  We told you this a year and a half ago. Had tarpally on about it. But here it is,
[3:55:30.960 --> 3:55:36.800]  London Telegraph. Give me a close shot of this, guys. Mumbai suspects is U.S. double agent,
[3:55:36.800 --> 3:55:41.280]  India claims. And it turned out that all the major shooters were double agents.
[3:55:41.280 --> 3:55:47.280]  And the few people they grabbed were on LSD and drug doubt. It was all staged.
[3:55:47.280 --> 3:55:50.800]  They dressed up a few dead bodies of people they shot and said that they were the Muslims.
[3:55:51.760 --> 3:55:56.880]  And governments, most of the time terror attacks, the big ones that get promoted are like this.
[3:55:57.520 --> 3:56:02.800]  There are real terror attacks going on. If a terror attacks real, you don't see the media hype it.
[3:56:04.320 --> 3:56:08.640]  I mean, in the 60s and 70s, there were close to a thousand bombings in the U.S.
[3:56:08.640 --> 3:56:13.520]  And it was hardly ever on the news because they were real. They're mainly communist bombings.
[3:56:15.280 --> 3:56:20.400]  But an American man charged with plotting the attacks on Mumbai was a double agent for both
[3:56:20.400 --> 3:56:26.720]  the United States and Al Qaeda terror group. Indian officials have said, okay, here's another one.
[3:56:26.720 --> 3:56:31.920]  Russia today, that's directly from the Russian government then. I mean, it's their government
[3:56:31.920 --> 3:56:39.040]  funded English speaking channel. Russia says new military doctrine, more threats, smaller risk.
[3:56:39.040 --> 3:56:44.640]  And they say that since the United States and NATO, NATO changed its, its doctrine a few years ago
[3:56:44.640 --> 3:56:51.280]  to first strike. And NATO, Russia said, please don't do that. And NATO has said, but our media
[3:56:51.280 --> 3:56:56.960]  is going to say that Russia is the only one doing this. No, NATO said we will strike Russia first
[3:56:56.960 --> 3:57:04.880]  and then did 888 trying to test Russia. And again, the bankers, it's not the Americans
[3:57:04.880 --> 3:57:10.160]  or Europe versus the Russians. It's the bankers angry that Russia kicked out some oligarchs
[3:57:10.800 --> 3:57:14.000]  to have their own corrupt system. But it's theirs.
[3:57:16.640 --> 3:57:21.280]  Russia military will have more options to use nuclear arms. They can see potential threats
[3:57:21.280 --> 3:57:25.520]  to the country security. When the new military doctrine comes into force, the document which is
[3:57:25.520 --> 3:57:29.520]  expected to be put into place before the year's end will replace the version adopted in 2000.
[3:57:29.520 --> 3:57:34.560]  The draft document was revealed to the media this week, reports the Gazeta newspaper,
[3:57:35.360 --> 3:57:40.480]  the secretary of the Russian security council announced that Moscow will consider nuclear
[3:57:40.480 --> 3:57:45.520]  weapons as a possible option in more situations than it used to, which is what the Pentagon said
[3:57:45.520 --> 3:57:50.240]  they're going to do. A preemptive nuclear strike with weapons will be possible scenario.
[3:57:50.240 --> 3:57:54.240]  And they go on to say if Western Europe gets involved in any of their border areas
[3:57:54.240 --> 3:57:57.760]  or gets in any of their business, they're going to nuke us.
[3:58:00.320 --> 3:58:03.840]  The bankers don't care. The hell, they'll set off a nuke and say Russia did it. I mean,
[3:58:03.840 --> 3:58:09.520]  they all got underground bunkers. So the globalists are devilish. They want their
[3:58:09.520 --> 3:58:15.200]  world government and they're going to get it by hook or by crook. Copenhagen climate conference,
[3:58:15.200 --> 3:58:20.240]  Arnold Schwarzenegger calls for planetary transformation through global governance.
[3:58:20.240 --> 3:58:27.360]  I mean, just get out of here, you surfer. I know you dreamed of being a Hitler,
[3:58:27.360 --> 3:58:33.840]  like you said, but you got the wrong country, pal. Hey, you still can get this in time for
