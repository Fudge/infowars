[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.880]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.880 --> 00:26.880]  the full report is up on info wars.com from last night's nightly news I want to kick this
[00:26.880 --> 00:32.200]  transmission off by interrupting my own transmission with this transmission on
[00:32.200 --> 00:35.800]  Obama preparing to take over the telecommunications systems including the
[00:35.800 --> 00:41.400]  internet and your smartphone here it is and finally tonight on info wars and
[00:41.400 --> 00:47.040]  nightly news I want to break down a story that showed up in headlines across
[00:47.040 --> 00:51.520]  the country and even as far away as England tonight new alert system gives
[00:51.520 --> 00:57.360]  president special code for emergency messages that's out of the hill the
[00:57.360 --> 01:01.080]  Daily Mail got it right saying new emergency alert system will give
[01:01.080 --> 01:06.640]  Obama the power to flip a switch and address the entire nation at once the
[01:06.640 --> 01:14.240]  Washington Post described it as something out of George Arwell's 1984 I'm one
[01:14.240 --> 01:18.640]  of the first people in the United States to start warning of this as far back as
[01:18.640 --> 01:25.880]  1996 because broadcast engineers in radio stations that I was working in had
[01:25.880 --> 01:30.640]  been part of the Texas Association of broadcast meetings where the feds under
[01:30.640 --> 01:36.920]  Clinton's orders were preparing to have it ready by 1999 so Bill Clinton could
[01:36.920 --> 01:45.120]  start overriding radio and TV broadcast VHF UHF AM FM and be able to force his
[01:45.120 --> 01:50.280]  messages onto the air like something out of the old Soviet Union a literal
[01:50.280 --> 01:56.400]  broadcast kill switch is what it did it didn't allow the stations to tune to an
[01:56.400 --> 02:00.320]  emergency channel to put the president on it had it where the systems couldn't
[02:00.320 --> 02:05.440]  work and were overridden by federal pieces of equipment at the tower and at
[02:05.440 --> 02:11.040]  the broadcast site and I interviewed on air changing their voices multiple
[02:11.040 --> 02:17.200]  broadcast engineers one of them very high level up and since then and films
[02:17.200 --> 02:22.800]  like police state 2000 I exposed it in 1999 now in previous reports in the last
[02:22.800 --> 02:28.040]  19 years we've broken down the evil authoritarian applications of all of
[02:28.040 --> 02:32.920]  these systems but I want to recap some of those for you now this allows the
[02:32.920 --> 02:38.200]  state to begin the process of openly having state-run media not just
[02:38.200 --> 02:42.680]  covertly funding the dinosaur media and the Pentagon got the law change last
[02:42.680 --> 02:47.320]  year to be able to engage in domestic deception or psyops here in the United
[02:47.320 --> 02:52.920]  States but its real intention is to be able to cut off anything embarrassing
[02:52.920 --> 02:59.560]  like Rand Paul and his filibuster being cut off across the world and across the
[02:59.560 --> 03:05.520]  United States in channels carrying US media when he was engaged in his
[03:05.520 --> 03:12.120]  filibuster that's what this is all about again even the Washington Post when we
[03:12.120 --> 03:16.600]  have linked here in our article from 2011 described it as something out of
[03:16.600 --> 03:22.400]  Orwell's 1984 this was already in place by then it was in place in the late
[03:22.400 --> 03:27.040]  90s but it expanded to be on smartphones all computers you name it my
[03:27.040 --> 03:34.200]  phone my Apple iPhone 5 that's really a portable computer turns on now when the
[03:34.200 --> 03:38.360]  Obama alerts come in and it's always about hurricanes or floods something
[03:38.360 --> 03:44.880]  reasonable but that could be done locally it's setting the precedent so that
[03:44.880 --> 03:49.560]  people get accustomed to it so we can begin to get the political messages it
[03:49.560 --> 03:54.120]  was floated by the Association of Broadcasters nationally and right here
[03:54.120 --> 04:01.240]  in Texas back in 1996-97 that again there would be government programming not
[04:01.240 --> 04:07.720]  just PSAs routinely overriding hours a day and that's what had the Association
[04:07.720 --> 04:13.560]  so upset and so they were able to get some of it backed off that is not the
[04:13.560 --> 04:18.520]  case now the feds are pushing for digital license plates that only cost a
[04:18.520 --> 04:22.640]  few dollars the technology's gotten so cheap that have messages about who's
[04:22.640 --> 04:27.680]  wanted and images of people on your license plates this is that is just part
[04:27.680 --> 04:31.640]  of the report it's got a few minutes left the full report is up on info wars
[04:31.640 --> 04:38.360]  calm on this live Wednesday the 16th of July 2014 transmission I'll also later
[04:38.360 --> 04:41.840]  in the hour air the entire report because it's so important for our
[04:41.840 --> 04:45.440]  affiliates to know what's going on I know most of them are aware of what's
[04:45.440 --> 04:49.760]  happening but this is a big deal and we need to treat it as such and try to make
[04:49.760 --> 04:54.160]  this a controversy because if you don't make tyranny a controversy it becomes
[04:54.160 --> 04:58.320]  the norm and you become a slave
[04:58.320 --> 05:03.200]  city of Austin tap water versus filtered city of Austin tap water I didn't
[05:03.200 --> 05:07.240]  taste dirt in it God knows what's in this these people just sampled city of
[05:07.240 --> 05:11.360]  Austin tap water straight from the faucet next we had them try a sample of
[05:11.360 --> 05:16.440]  tap water filtered for the Cropure G2.0 filtration system that one is better
[05:16.440 --> 05:20.200]  tastes like nothing yep I know a good water tastes like it's good water most
[05:20.200 --> 05:25.400]  tap water contains added substances like fluoride chlorine glyphosate and many
[05:25.400 --> 05:28.960]  others studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of
[05:28.960 --> 05:33.280]  major health issues including tooth decay lower than IQ and even cancer it
[05:33.280 --> 05:36.020]  tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're doing top water the
[05:36.020 --> 05:41.320]  probe your G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances leaving
[05:41.320 --> 05:45.760]  only fresh tasting deliciously clean water but this is very tasty it's good

[08:10.040 --> 08:15.600]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones on the
[08:15.600 --> 08:27.800]  GCN radio network. Waging war on corruption. It is the 16th day of July 2014 on this
[08:27.800 --> 08:35.840]  Wednesday worldwide transmission. I am your host Alex Jones and we are going to
[08:35.840 --> 08:41.840]  be here for the next three hours Lord willing. I want to take phone calls in
[08:41.840 --> 08:47.720]  the first hour. We've got Abby Johnson who was unable to come on the show last
[08:47.720 --> 08:52.840]  week from here in Austin because of all the traffic being shut down with Barack
[08:52.840 --> 08:57.400]  Obama being in town. She was so stuck in her car she couldn't even get to a
[08:57.400 --> 09:01.720]  landline heading up a group that investigates Planned Parenthood and the
[09:01.720 --> 09:06.160]  fact that they target minorities. So we'll probably be called racist for
[09:06.160 --> 09:09.680]  trying to save Hispanic and black babies but nevertheless we will engage in the
[09:09.680 --> 09:13.760]  racism here today. Now if I was a Nazi collaborator like George Soros I'd get
[09:13.760 --> 09:17.280]  ADL awards but side issue or Schwarzenegger I'd get ADL awards but
[09:17.280 --> 09:21.240]  side issue and 2 plus 2 equals 5 Obama said and you didn't build your business
[09:21.240 --> 09:24.760]  and raising the debt limit doesn't raise the debt limit. I know I just keep going
[09:24.760 --> 09:30.080]  back to that. I just realized I'm a bad person and Steve Watson has a article
[09:30.080 --> 09:34.520]  out today majority reject Obama policies across the board because they're bad
[09:34.520 --> 09:41.160]  not because of racism. You know it's just funny that we have to say that. I was
[09:41.160 --> 09:44.160]  thinking about the borders collapsing and how horrible that's going to be for
[09:44.160 --> 09:50.200]  all Americans. It's a no-brainer on every front and that I kind of shrink from
[09:50.200 --> 09:53.560]  even bringing it up because of political correctness even I am under
[09:53.560 --> 09:58.880]  mind control. We should be angry that we've been conditioned that it's racist
[09:58.880 --> 10:04.120]  to say we should not let third world countries collapse into us and sure the
[10:04.120 --> 10:08.880]  feds have got robots online that go around posing as racist you know calling
[10:08.880 --> 10:13.240]  Hispanics names in all the forums and we've tracked a lot of it back. Most of
[10:13.240 --> 10:17.880]  it is bots doing it just to make us all in fight. I mean we're in a science
[10:17.880 --> 10:24.760]  fiction movie people. We are in a science fiction movie and the globalist
[10:24.760 --> 10:31.640]  are manipulating the human condition publicly. I mean this whole telecommunications
[10:31.640 --> 10:35.600]  takeover that I'm going to cover at the bottom of the hour where they're saying
[10:35.600 --> 10:39.440]  oh you're going to start seeing Obama on TV hearing him on the radio and on your
[10:39.440 --> 10:43.520]  smartphone it's not just going to be text he's going to be breaking in with
[10:43.520 --> 10:48.560]  announcements. I told you years ago they put the system in I said when they get
[10:48.560 --> 10:56.480]  ready to start using it get ready. At first it'll be hurricanes and
[10:56.480 --> 11:00.000]  earthquakes and things to set the precedent it's reasonable and then
[11:00.000 --> 11:04.320]  it's going to be political announcements just like they started 20 years ago put
[11:04.320 --> 11:08.920]  up those highway signs for amber alerts and Alzheimer's patients and now they
[11:08.920 --> 11:17.120]  have do not drink and walk or you'll be arrested in Austin or call this number
[11:17.120 --> 11:23.120]  to report illegal guns and then people don't know that what guns are illegal
[11:23.120 --> 11:27.240]  most TV shows are based in fantasy land where guns are all banned and you go to
[11:27.240 --> 11:31.680]  jail for having a gun you know the cops shows and so the cops come. I mean it's
[11:31.680 --> 11:40.360]  mind control literally operating off of a public that doesn't know where their
[11:40.360 --> 11:44.640]  butt is with both hands. I mean I'm sorry to use terms like that but that's the
[11:44.640 --> 11:49.680]  only way to describe it. I mean it's just such victims such domesticated
[11:49.680 --> 11:56.400]  pathetic jellyfish like unbelievably mindless having no idea that they're
[11:56.400 --> 12:04.080]  being circled by wolves and sharks that are dragging innocent mindless weak
[12:04.080 --> 12:09.240]  people off into the system to be torn to shreds slowly and liberately and
[12:09.240 --> 12:16.560]  disgustingly. I don't know how else to describe all of this and that's the
[12:16.560 --> 12:21.680]  thing about tyranny is that when you put up with it it becomes completely over
[12:21.680 --> 12:33.480]  the top every time and it is now absolutely over the top over the top
[12:33.480 --> 12:39.120]  and it's going to get more over the top that's what over the top means and I
[12:39.120 --> 12:41.960]  know I'm stating the obvious here but it's just hitting me all the time my
[12:41.960 --> 12:47.280]  gosh this is really all happening and it's going to get crazier and it's all
[12:47.280 --> 12:53.160]  going to come true our worst nightmares because you let evil people run things
[12:53.160 --> 13:05.880]  welcome to my nightmare I know you're gonna like it quote Alice Cooper the
[13:05.880 --> 13:15.880]  globalist like nightmares that's their dreams I read a lot of criminology and
[13:15.880 --> 13:18.640]  I've interviewed a lot of the top psychiatrists and psychologists I forget
[13:18.640 --> 13:22.360]  if she is her names I heard her on Coast to Coast years ago I'd seen her on
[13:22.360 --> 13:25.840]  Discovery Channel History Channel we need to look it up and remember had her
[13:25.840 --> 13:28.240]  on a few years ago and I heard her on George Norrie for like three hours I
[13:28.240 --> 13:32.480]  got her on for two hours one day and she's one of the most famous criminologists
[13:32.480 --> 13:36.960]  psychologists I forget her name just look up famous psychologists to serial
[13:36.960 --> 13:42.640]  killers and her name will come up top that's the guys we get her on cuz I
[13:42.640 --> 13:46.360]  keep wanting to get her on the keep forgetting to look it up and you know I've
[13:46.360 --> 13:51.920]  probably only read 20 books or so that's not that many on the criminology of
[13:51.920 --> 13:57.960]  serial killers and people like that sounds like a lot it's not but the
[13:57.960 --> 14:02.000]  overwhelming thing is that a lot of them have nightmares and are like basically
[14:02.000 --> 14:04.800]  think they're being attacked by demons all the time whether you believe that's
[14:04.800 --> 14:11.600]  real or not this is the archetype that they're going through and the only time
[14:11.600 --> 14:15.640]  they feel good and the only time they feel satisfied is when they've got a
[14:15.640 --> 14:20.160]  five-year-old child tied down torturing them for six weeks and quote using them
[14:20.160 --> 14:24.960]  up sucking their energy out torturing them to death slowly until they're not
[14:24.960 --> 14:28.040]  even horrified anymore and can't beg anymore and can't be in total horror
[14:28.040 --> 14:36.800]  anymore then they kill them and that's what you know in the authoritarian regimes
[14:36.800 --> 14:43.600]  totalitarian regimes but prisons and dungeons are about is a supper of Satan
[14:43.600 --> 14:52.480]  it's a feeding off the energy vampirically see vampires are real but
[14:52.480 --> 14:56.360]  not with fangs and they don't live forever but they're all over the place
[14:56.360 --> 15:01.680]  and they're trying to create a culture shift where all these weak people become
[15:01.680 --> 15:06.080]  like Wren fields who aren't really vampires but serve the vampires and
[15:06.080 --> 15:10.120]  think they're getting power off the reflected glow of being right up against
[15:10.120 --> 15:19.840]  it and that's what the zombie iconography is about all of it is about a
[15:19.840 --> 15:26.840]  satanic wave that is already breaking through the hedge in the gate and is
[15:26.840 --> 15:36.400]  now going to fully come in to manifest welcome to my nightmare I think you're
[15:36.400 --> 15:46.120]  gonna like it I don't think I'm gonna like it I don't think you're gonna like
[15:46.120 --> 15:57.480]  it but the point is I was interviewing her I was just going off the bookside
[15:57.480 --> 16:05.640]  read and the things I'd seen and also I guess you could call it demonic
[16:05.640 --> 16:14.080]  temptation that you know that I've dealt with where where basically you get
[16:14.080 --> 16:19.760]  assaulted by evil until you give into it but then it just basically drives you
[16:19.760 --> 16:26.200]  they have a word for it and that's what this new world order is all about is
[16:26.200 --> 16:30.240]  is is that force whether you believe it's an archetype manifesting through
[16:30.240 --> 16:34.160]  the human psyche or whether it's interdimensional beings doing it the
[16:34.160 --> 16:37.400]  ancients you know all across the board said no it's its interdimensional beings
[16:37.400 --> 16:46.400]  doing it it wants a global technocracy machine that it can drive that it can
[16:46.400 --> 17:00.080]  possess the ghost and the machine and it's not the Holy Ghost and the world
[17:00.080 --> 17:12.400]  more and more is being possessed by it the rebellion the lust the fire the
[17:12.400 --> 17:19.040]  power but at the bottom of the rat hole a lot of strong good people are
[17:19.040 --> 17:23.240]  attracted just to the fire because it looks like strength on the surface you
[17:23.240 --> 17:27.960]  go through that wall of fire it's ice cold evil and wants to rip children into
[17:27.960 --> 17:32.160]  pieces and torture small babies so that's why you've got a totally reject
[17:32.160 --> 17:36.240]  Satan and I'm talking to all the Renfields out there that think you know
[17:36.240 --> 17:41.080]  about evil that think you're cool and shocking with your dark sunglasses and
[17:41.080 --> 17:44.360]  your green shirt and your black jacket you know and you're imagining you're in
[17:44.360 --> 17:51.240]  all this evil you have not seen anything and you have no idea you're weak and
[17:51.240 --> 17:58.680]  that's why you are attracted to it is because there is power there the God
[17:58.680 --> 18:06.720]  of this world you like the style of darkness

[19:02.360 --> 19:10.520]  rest of the time they are absolutely cold and pathetic and unhappy you know
[19:10.520 --> 19:13.560]  the baseline pop psychology says that they just don't have feelings that don't
[19:13.560 --> 19:21.680]  care that's not true they're gone and so they have no personality because
[19:21.680 --> 19:29.880]  they're not home they're only animated when the ghost is driving the machine

[24:14.720 --> 24:27.120]  didn't give no living to Big John. Big John. Big John. Big Bath John
[24:27.120 --> 24:30.120]  Big John
[24:30.120 --> 24:33.120]  Nobody seemed to know where John called home
[24:33.120 --> 24:36.120]  He just drifted into town and stayed all alone
[24:36.120 --> 24:39.120]  Didn't say much, kinda quiet and shy
[24:39.120 --> 24:44.120]  But he spoke it out, he just said hi to Big John
[24:44.120 --> 24:47.120]  Somebody said he came from New Orleans
[24:47.120 --> 24:50.120]  Where he got in a fight over a Cajun queen
[24:50.120 --> 24:53.120]  And I crashed and blow from a huge right hand
[24:53.120 --> 24:56.120]  A fellow to the promised land, Big John

[25:01.120 --> 25:03.120]  Big Bad John
[25:03.120 --> 25:05.120]  Big Bad John
[25:05.120 --> 25:08.120]  Alright folks, we are back live
[25:08.120 --> 25:12.120]  Then came the day at the bottom of the mine
[25:12.120 --> 25:15.120]  When a timber cracked and men started crying
[25:15.120 --> 25:18.120]  Minors were praying and hearts beat fast
[25:18.120 --> 25:22.120]  Everybody thought that they'd breathed the last said John
[25:22.120 --> 25:25.120]  Through the dust and the smoke with this man made hell
[25:25.120 --> 25:28.120]  Walked a giant of a man that the miners knew well
[25:28.120 --> 25:31.120]  Grabbed a sagging timber, gave out with a groan
[25:31.120 --> 25:33.120]  And like a giant old tree just stood there alone
[25:33.120 --> 25:34.120]  Big John
[25:34.120 --> 25:36.120]  Alright folks, let's get into the news here
[25:36.120 --> 25:37.120]  Big John
[25:37.120 --> 25:38.120]  Big John
[25:38.120 --> 25:39.120]  Big John
[25:39.120 --> 25:40.120]  Big John
[25:40.120 --> 25:41.120]  Big Bad John
[25:41.120 --> 25:43.120]  Big Bad John
[25:43.120 --> 25:46.120]  I guess we might as well just finish the song, it's a good story
[25:48.120 --> 25:50.120]  With all this strength he gave a mighty shove
[25:50.120 --> 25:53.120]  Then a miner yelled out, there's a light up above
[25:53.120 --> 25:56.120]  And twenty men scrambled from a would-be grave
[25:56.120 --> 26:01.120]  Now there's only one left down there to save Big John
[26:01.120 --> 26:04.120]  With jacks and timbers they started back down
[26:04.120 --> 26:07.120]  Then came that rumble, weed down in the ground
[26:07.120 --> 26:10.120]  And the smoking gas fell straight out of that mine
[26:10.120 --> 26:15.120]  Everybody knew it was the end of the line for Big John
[26:15.120 --> 26:16.120]  Big John
[26:16.120 --> 26:18.120]  Big John
[26:18.120 --> 26:20.120]  Big John
[26:20.120 --> 26:23.120]  Big Bad John
[26:23.120 --> 26:24.120]  Big John
[26:24.120 --> 26:26.120]  I guess you could go to iTunes and hear the whole thing
[26:26.120 --> 26:28.120]  Now they never reopened that word
[26:28.120 --> 26:31.120]  That's not an informational app about a sponsor
[26:31.120 --> 26:32.120]  Stand in front of it
[26:32.120 --> 26:36.120]  These key words are written on that stand
[26:36.120 --> 26:41.120]  At the bottom of this mine lies a big big man
[26:41.120 --> 26:42.120]  Big John
[26:42.120 --> 26:44.120]  Alright folks, so now
[26:44.120 --> 26:45.120]  Big John
[26:45.120 --> 26:48.120]  Let me just go ahead and tell you what's coming up here on the show today
[26:48.120 --> 26:49.120]  Excuse me
[26:49.120 --> 26:51.120]  Big Bad John
[26:51.120 --> 26:56.120]  Bank of America offering 13 billion to resolve probe
[26:56.120 --> 26:59.120]  Bank previously offered 12 billion to settle the matter
[26:59.120 --> 27:01.120]  Sounds like a lot doesn't it
[27:01.120 --> 27:06.120]  But it's actually trillions, trillions of swindling
[27:06.120 --> 27:11.120]  Money laundering, derivatives, credit default swaps
[27:11.120 --> 27:15.120]  Counterfeiting fraud
[27:15.120 --> 27:17.120]  A mountain
[27:17.120 --> 27:19.120]  And that's what the big six banks are all involved in
[27:19.120 --> 27:21.120]  And they run the narcotics
[27:21.120 --> 27:23.120]  And they run the weapons worldwide
[27:23.120 --> 27:24.120]  And they run the media
[27:24.120 --> 27:29.120]  And they run all the moves to overthrow our society
[27:29.120 --> 27:31.120]  And why shouldn't they?
[27:31.120 --> 27:36.120]  I mean we sit here and let the globalists issue the currency and credit worldwide
[27:36.120 --> 27:39.120]  That they can just buy anything they want with
[27:39.120 --> 27:46.120]  Brand new jets, palaces, our daughters, our sons
[27:46.120 --> 27:49.120]  Go off and fight and die and do everything else
[27:49.120 --> 27:54.120]  To serve them and it's all pulled out of a rabbit's hat
[27:54.120 --> 27:58.120]  Like a little oak and carved chit
[27:58.120 --> 28:00.120]  A tally stick
[28:00.120 --> 28:04.120]  That was the money 1,000 years ago in England
[28:04.120 --> 28:05.120]  Because the king declared it
[28:05.120 --> 28:07.120]  He just said, I'm a stick sweet car
[28:07.120 --> 28:17.120]  But buys things, horses, ships, dry goods, weapons, beer
[28:17.120 --> 28:20.120]  With a stick
[28:20.120 --> 28:25.120]  And you just can't get the public to even realize that the federal reserve is not federal
[28:25.120 --> 28:29.120]  You think people get mad about that
[28:29.120 --> 28:32.120]  You think people would get concerned that
[28:32.120 --> 28:35.120]  You mean it's not federal and it runs everything
[28:35.120 --> 28:40.120]  It's really a front group for a bunch of foreign banks
[28:40.120 --> 28:44.120]  You know in Australia and England and the United States all the same
[28:44.120 --> 28:48.120]  Same CPS, same force vaccines
[28:48.120 --> 28:51.120]  Same exact names of the agencies in most cases
[28:51.120 --> 28:53.120]  Because big banks come up with it
[28:53.120 --> 28:56.120]  They run the whole show
[28:56.120 --> 29:00.120]  The whole stinking show from pillar to post
[29:00.120 --> 29:03.120]  And in America
[29:03.120 --> 29:05.120]  If you walk up to the Federal Reserve
[29:05.120 --> 29:07.120]  Or you're even a quarter mile away videotaping
[29:07.120 --> 29:09.120]  Armed men will show up
[29:09.120 --> 29:12.120]  Who are armed security guards
[29:12.120 --> 29:16.120]  Calling themselves federal officers
[29:16.120 --> 29:21.120]  And they will threaten you
[29:21.120 --> 29:24.120]  And they will have the police come
[29:24.120 --> 29:27.120]  And the police will falsely arrest you
[29:27.120 --> 29:28.120]  In many cases
[29:28.120 --> 29:31.120]  We have it on video
[29:31.120 --> 29:34.120]  Because let me tell you something, you're scum to them
[29:34.120 --> 29:37.120]  They're going to take your whole world and my whole world down
[29:37.120 --> 29:40.120]  And there's nothing you're going to do about it in their mind
[29:40.120 --> 29:42.120]  And if we sit there and take it
[29:42.120 --> 29:44.120]  We deserve what comes
[29:44.120 --> 29:47.120]  We'll be right back up this way
[29:47.120 --> 29:49.120]  We're on the march
[29:49.120 --> 29:51.120]  The Empire's on the run
[29:51.120 --> 30:17.120]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[30:21.120 --> 30:23.120]  We're talking about Made in America
[30:23.120 --> 30:25.120]  Belt buckles and nickled brass
[30:25.120 --> 30:27.120]  This is more than a summer blowout special
[30:27.120 --> 30:30.120]  This is a new declaration of independence
[30:30.120 --> 30:32.120]  But to expand the info orb
[30:32.120 --> 30:36.120]  We're offering the equivalent of more than five months free

[30:54.120 --> 31:22.120]  You can take my gun from my cold dead aunt's
[31:22.120 --> 31:24.120]  Well over a thousand types of mold in mildew
[31:24.120 --> 31:26.120]  Linked to numerous conditions
[31:26.120 --> 31:28.120]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans
[31:28.120 --> 31:30.120]  Live with pets they're allergic to as well
[31:30.120 --> 31:32.120]  When I began to research these statistics
[31:32.120 --> 31:35.120]  It was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs
[31:35.120 --> 31:38.120]  In order to combat the toxic environment
[31:38.120 --> 31:40.120]  That we cannot escape but that we can fight back against
[31:40.120 --> 31:43.120]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs
[31:43.120 --> 31:45.120]  And manufactured in the USA
[31:45.120 --> 31:47.120]  The new info wars life lung cleanse is here

[31:58.120 --> 32:00.120]  I can like taste dirt in it
[32:00.120 --> 32:01.120]  God knows what's in there
[32:01.120 --> 32:04.120]  These people just sampled city of Austin tap water
[32:04.120 --> 32:05.120]  Straight from the faucet
[32:05.120 --> 32:08.120]  Next we had them try a sample of tap water
[32:08.120 --> 32:11.120]  Filtered through the Pro Pure G2.0 filtration system
[32:11.120 --> 32:12.120]  Now my nose is better
[32:12.120 --> 32:13.120]  Tastes like nothing
[32:13.120 --> 32:15.120]  Yep, I know what good water tastes like
[32:15.120 --> 32:16.120]  It's good water
[32:16.120 --> 32:18.120]  Most tap water contains added substances
[32:18.120 --> 32:22.120]  Like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate and many others
[32:22.120 --> 32:24.120]  Studies prove that these substances are linked
[32:24.120 --> 32:26.120]  To an assortment of major health issues
[32:26.120 --> 32:29.120]  Including tooth decay, lower IQ and even cancer
[32:29.120 --> 32:31.120]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake
[32:31.120 --> 32:32.120]  When you're drinking tap water
[32:32.120 --> 32:35.120]  The Pro Pure G2.0 filtration system
[32:35.120 --> 32:37.120]  Removes these deadly substances
[32:37.120 --> 32:40.120]  Leaving only fresh tasting deliciously clean water
[32:40.120 --> 32:42.120]  Okay, this is very tasty
[32:42.120 --> 32:43.120]  It's good water
[32:43.120 --> 32:44.120]  Refreshing
[32:43.120 --> 32:44.120]  It's good
[32:44.120 --> 32:46.120]  Go to infowarsstore.com today
[32:46.120 --> 32:48.120]  And get your free wire stand
[32:48.120 --> 32:52.120]  With the purchase of a Pro Pure Big Water Filtration System
[32:52.120 --> 33:20.120]  Or call 1-888-253-3139
[33:23.120 --> 33:29.120]  They have taken the hearts and minds of our leaders
[33:29.120 --> 33:32.120]  They have recruited the rich and the powerful
[33:32.120 --> 33:35.120]  And they have blinded us to the truth
[33:35.120 --> 33:38.120]  The question is, do we all work for central bankers?
[33:38.120 --> 33:41.120]  That's what I want to address to our guests tonight
[33:41.120 --> 33:44.120]  Our impulses are being redirected
[33:44.120 --> 33:48.120]  We are living in an artificially induced state of consciousness
[33:48.120 --> 33:50.120]  That resembles sleep
[33:50.120 --> 33:54.120]  An estimated 50 to 70 million Americans suffer
[33:54.120 --> 33:57.120]  From a sleep disorder or sleep deprivation
[33:57.120 --> 34:00.120]  Outside the limit of our sight
[34:00.120 --> 34:02.120]  Feeding office
[34:02.120 --> 34:05.120]  Pinched on top of us from right to death
[34:05.120 --> 34:07.120]  Are our owners
[34:07.120 --> 34:09.120]  Latest census numbers prove the United States
[34:09.120 --> 34:11.120]  Has the biggest gap between rich and poor
[34:11.120 --> 34:14.120]  Compared to all westernized countries today
[34:14.120 --> 34:17.120]  Our projections show that by the year 2025
[34:17.120 --> 34:20.120]  Not only America, but the entire planet
[34:20.120 --> 34:23.120]  Will be under the protection and the dominion
[34:23.120 --> 34:25.120]  Of this power alliance
[34:25.120 --> 34:27.120]  The gains have been substantial
[34:27.120 --> 34:30.120]  Both for ourselves and for you
[34:30.120 --> 34:32.120]  The human power elite
[34:37.120 --> 34:41.120]  And for the first time in all of human history
[34:43.120 --> 34:45.120]  Mankind is politically awakened
[34:45.120 --> 34:47.120]  That's a total new reality
[34:47.120 --> 34:50.120]  I've got one that can see
[34:50.120 --> 34:53.120]  We can't be the only ones who can see
[34:53.120 --> 34:55.120]  Unfortunately, you've grown up
[34:55.120 --> 34:57.120]  Hearing voices that incessantly
[34:57.120 --> 34:59.120]  Warn of government is nothing more
[34:59.120 --> 35:01.120]  Than some separate sinister entity
[35:01.120 --> 35:03.120]  That's got them at the root of all our problems
[35:03.120 --> 35:06.120]  It's a new morning in America
[35:06.120 --> 35:08.120]  Fresh, vital
[35:08.120 --> 35:10.120]  The old cynicism is gone
[35:10.120 --> 35:13.120]  We have faith in our leaders
[35:13.120 --> 35:17.120]  We're optimistic as to what the comes of it all
[35:17.120 --> 35:21.120]  It really boils down to our ability to accept
[35:21.120 --> 35:24.120]  We don't need pessimism
[35:24.120 --> 35:26.120]  I have two words for you
[35:26.120 --> 35:28.120]  Predator drones
[35:31.120 --> 35:33.120]  And who are you, little dog?
[35:33.120 --> 35:35.120]  You will never see it coming
[35:35.120 --> 35:37.120]  Now, predicting the first guy
[35:37.120 --> 35:39.120]  Who uses a second amendment weapon
[35:39.120 --> 35:42.120]  To bring a drone down that's been hovering over his house
[35:42.120 --> 35:44.120]  Is going to be a folk hero in this country
[35:52.120 --> 35:54.120]  I'm just trying to warn you, folks
[35:54.120 --> 35:58.120]  The television is a giant LED weapon system
[35:58.120 --> 36:00.120]  It's so advanced
[36:00.120 --> 36:02.120]  They got a monkey farm in Bastrop, folks
[36:02.120 --> 36:04.120]  They do all sorts of testing on great apes
[36:04.120 --> 36:06.120]  Reese's monkeys, the whole nine yards
[36:06.120 --> 36:07.120]  And they'd go, oh, you didn't see this
[36:07.120 --> 36:08.120]  And punch a button in the beating
[36:08.120 --> 36:10.120]  Hundreds of monkeys with wires in their brains
[36:10.120 --> 36:12.120]  With television sets brainwashing them
[36:13.120 --> 36:16.120]  All I ever have to do is be famous
[36:16.120 --> 36:18.120]  People watch me
[36:18.120 --> 36:20.120]  And they love me
[36:20.120 --> 36:22.120]  You can have a little taste of that good life, too
[36:22.120 --> 36:23.120]  I know you want it
[36:23.120 --> 36:25.120]  Hell, everybody does
[36:25.120 --> 36:27.120]  Do it to your own kind
[36:27.120 --> 36:29.120]  What's the threat?
[36:29.120 --> 36:31.120]  We all sell out every day
[36:31.120 --> 36:33.120]  Might as well be on the winning team
[36:33.120 --> 36:36.120]  The real men of the world have to stand up and say
[36:36.120 --> 36:41.120]  I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass
[36:41.120 --> 36:44.120]  And I'm all out of bubblegum
[36:44.120 --> 36:47.120]  Time to take a stand, boys
[36:47.120 --> 36:49.120]  You know what? You got a little courage
[36:49.120 --> 36:51.120]  Stand up for yourself
[36:53.120 --> 36:55.120]  Waging war on corruption
[36:55.120 --> 36:57.120]  It's Alex Jones
[36:57.120 --> 37:01.120]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War
[37:02.120 --> 37:04.120]  The Oscar winners give a press conference
[37:04.120 --> 37:06.120]  And how to buy a sailboat
[37:17.120 --> 37:18.120]  Again, ladies and gentlemen
[37:18.120 --> 37:21.120]  We are live broadcasting worldwide
[37:21.120 --> 37:22.120]  On this Wednesday edition
[37:22.120 --> 37:24.120]  I'd like to hear from you on any subject
[37:24.120 --> 37:26.120]  You'd like to discuss
[37:26.120 --> 37:28.120]  From the collapsing borders
[37:28.120 --> 37:29.120]  To the decline of the dollar
[37:29.120 --> 37:31.120]  To banks in the U.S. and Europe
[37:31.120 --> 37:34.120]  Now saying, yeah, we may start charging you to have deposits
[37:34.120 --> 37:38.120]  And changing regulations with governments to bail in
[37:38.120 --> 37:42.120]  Or actually take your money out of the bank to protect it
[37:42.120 --> 37:44.120]  I said that
[37:44.120 --> 37:46.120]  Take your money
[37:46.120 --> 37:47.120]  Take your Social Security
[37:47.120 --> 37:48.120]  Take your pension
[37:48.120 --> 37:50.120]  Take your 401K
[37:50.120 --> 37:51.120]  Take your stocks
[37:51.120 --> 37:54.120]  And take part of it to protect it
[37:54.120 --> 37:56.120]  You know, 2 plus 2 equals 5
[37:56.120 --> 37:59.120]  You know, Heather has two mommies
[37:59.120 --> 38:02.120]  You know, open borders are good
[38:02.120 --> 38:06.120]  You know, George Washington is bad
[38:06.120 --> 38:09.120]  You know, we need to be like Chicago
[38:09.120 --> 38:10.120]  Highest crime rate in the world
[38:10.120 --> 38:12.120]  By taking guns from citizens
[38:12.120 --> 38:14.120]  You know, gun control works
[38:14.120 --> 38:16.120]  You know, you didn't build that business
[38:16.120 --> 38:18.120]  You know, raising the debt doesn't raise the debt
[38:18.120 --> 38:21.120]  You know, you know, you know
[38:21.120 --> 38:24.120]  The government runs ISIS, but that's no big deal
[38:24.120 --> 38:26.120]  But ISIS is a threat
[38:26.120 --> 38:27.120]  So we've got to take all your rights
[38:27.120 --> 38:31.120]  It's the inversion of reality by design
[38:31.120 --> 38:35.120]  Flaunting it in our faces
[38:35.120 --> 38:36.120]  toll free number to join us
[38:36.120 --> 38:39.120]  800-259-9231
[38:39.120 --> 38:42.120]  800-259-9231
[38:42.120 --> 38:44.120]  Here's some of the headlines
[38:44.120 --> 38:48.120]  I'll just start now
[38:48.120 --> 38:54.120]  Cry havoc and lose the dogs of war
[38:54.120 --> 38:58.120]  Feds to open $50 million resort for illegals
[38:58.120 --> 39:00.120]  And their children complete with tennis courts
[39:00.120 --> 39:02.120]  Saunas and pools
[39:02.120 --> 39:03.120]  That is not a joke
[39:03.120 --> 39:05.120]  That is up on DrudgeReport.com
[39:05.120 --> 39:09.120]  With the photos and the official announcement
[39:09.120 --> 39:13.120]  That the feds are basically going to be
[39:13.120 --> 39:14.120]  Through faith-based initiatives
[39:14.120 --> 39:16.120]  That's what Bush started
[39:16.120 --> 39:19.120]  And the Democrats love
[39:19.120 --> 39:21.120]  Total violation of the First Amendment
[39:21.120 --> 39:23.120]  The churches, and this is a Baptist group
[39:23.120 --> 39:24.120]  Doing that
[39:24.120 --> 39:26.120]  So the Catholics, Baptists, they're all in on it
[39:26.120 --> 39:27.120]  At the top
[39:27.120 --> 39:31.120]  And then this country is just an absolute shambles
[39:31.120 --> 39:34.120]  This is why Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs cannot
[39:34.120 --> 39:36.120]  It's been a year
[39:36.120 --> 39:38.120]  And he goes to the VA constantly
[39:38.120 --> 39:40.120]  Since he's been here for three or four months
[39:40.120 --> 39:41.120]  He goes down every week
[39:41.120 --> 39:43.120]  He was down there again today
[39:43.120 --> 39:45.120]  To have a meeting about a meeting
[39:45.120 --> 39:46.120]  About a meeting
[39:46.120 --> 39:48.120]  And then he had another meeting today
[39:48.120 --> 39:50.120]  About a meeting to then get health care
[39:50.120 --> 39:53.120]  And he has to have black sheets
[39:53.120 --> 39:58.120]  For the blood he coughs up all night long
[39:58.120 --> 40:00.120]  And he goes in the bathroom here
[40:00.120 --> 40:05.120]  And coughs up blood
[40:05.120 --> 40:07.120]  And that's what happens
[40:07.120 --> 40:08.120]  When you get blown up in an armored vehicle
[40:08.120 --> 40:12.120]  That's on fire
[40:12.120 --> 40:16.120]  And he doesn't get health care
[40:16.120 --> 40:19.120]  But the illegals are now going to get a resort
[40:19.120 --> 40:22.120]  With saunas, pools, and hot tubs
[40:22.120 --> 40:24.120]  And they're going to get more than that
[40:24.120 --> 40:26.120]  Because you've got to incentivize
[40:26.120 --> 40:28.120]  Getting the people across Mexico
[40:28.120 --> 40:30.120]  From Central and South America
[40:30.120 --> 40:31.120]  It's dangerous
[40:31.120 --> 40:32.120]  You've, you know, sure
[40:32.120 --> 40:34.120]  They pay to get on trains
[40:34.120 --> 40:35.120]  Others are allowed to load on
[40:35.120 --> 40:36.120]  In a deliberate agreement
[40:36.120 --> 40:38.120]  With the Guatemalan president
[40:38.120 --> 40:41.120]  That wasn't public
[40:41.120 --> 40:43.120]  Until WorldNet Daily dug it out
[40:43.120 --> 40:45.120]  But it's confirmed
[40:45.120 --> 40:46.120]  They made the deal last year
[40:46.120 --> 40:47.120]  Obama went down there
[40:47.120 --> 40:48.120]  But it was obvious it was a deal
[40:48.120 --> 40:50.120]  I mean, Mexico used to have a very controlled border
[40:50.120 --> 40:51.120]  They still do
[40:51.120 --> 40:54.120]  But the illegals have to pay the government
[40:54.120 --> 40:57.120]  In cash at the Guatemalan border
[40:57.120 --> 40:59.120]  And then they're allowed to get on the trains
[40:59.120 --> 41:01.120]  And conduit up
[41:01.120 --> 41:03.120]  And then they're harshly dealt with
[41:03.120 --> 41:04.120]  If they get off the trains
[41:04.120 --> 41:05.120]  Anywhere in Mexico
[41:05.120 --> 41:06.120]  And they go, no, no, no
[41:06.120 --> 41:08.120]  We want to go to El Norte
[41:08.120 --> 41:11.120]  Because that's where you get
[41:11.120 --> 41:13.120]  Three hots in a bed
[41:13.120 --> 41:16.120]  And all the health care you need
[41:16.120 --> 41:20.120]  And now, tennis courts, saunas, and pools
[41:20.120 --> 41:23.120]  This is from the Gateway Pundit
[41:23.120 --> 41:26.120]  We've mirrored it up on infowars.com
[41:26.120 --> 41:28.120]  The Obama administration has awarded
[41:28.120 --> 41:31.120]  A $50 million contract to a charitable group
[41:31.120 --> 41:33.120]  To buy a Texas resort hotel
[41:33.120 --> 41:36.120]  And transform it into a 6,600
[41:36.120 --> 41:38.120]  Excuse me, 600, 600
[41:38.120 --> 41:42.120]  Bed facility for juvenile illegal aliens
[41:42.120 --> 41:45.120]  The beautiful Palm Air Resort & Hotel
[41:45.120 --> 41:47.120]  Has an indoor Olympic-sized pool
[41:47.120 --> 41:49.120]  Wow, that's nice
[41:49.120 --> 41:52.120]  And an outdoor pool
[41:52.120 --> 41:54.120]  I get to go pay $3 and swim in Barton Springs
[41:54.120 --> 41:56.120]  And I don't get that
[41:56.120 --> 41:58.120]  Free Wi-Fi, I don't get that
[41:58.120 --> 42:00.120]  And cable TV, I don't get that
[42:00.120 --> 42:01.120]  I have to pay for that
[42:01.120 --> 42:06.120]  And included is a
[42:06.120 --> 42:09.120]  Decorated guest rooms
[42:09.120 --> 42:12.120]  The Palm Air Hotel suites
[42:12.120 --> 42:16.120]  Is set to be sold to Baptist Child and Family Services
[42:16.120 --> 42:19.120]  Operating under the federal contract
[42:19.120 --> 42:21.120]  Pending local government approval
[42:21.120 --> 42:23.120]  According to reports from
[42:23.120 --> 42:25.120]  West Loco, Texas
[42:25.120 --> 42:27.120]  Where the hotel is located
[42:27.120 --> 42:29.120]  I want to send reporters down there right now
[42:29.120 --> 42:31.120]  Right now today, I just want somebody to go down there
[42:31.120 --> 42:33.120]  West Loco is a few miles from the Rio Grande
[42:33.120 --> 42:35.120]  In Hidalgo County
[42:35.120 --> 42:37.120]  I mean, get on an airplane
[42:37.120 --> 42:39.120]  Fly there, boom, let's do it right now
[42:39.120 --> 42:41.120]  The Resort Hotel for Illegal Alien Children
[42:41.120 --> 42:44.120]  Is reportedly the first in the nation
[42:44.120 --> 42:47.120]  And looks like a nice South Texas resort
[42:47.120 --> 42:49.120]  I take my family sometimes
[42:49.120 --> 42:50.120]  Down to the funky Texas beach
[42:50.120 --> 42:52.120]  When we stay in places like this, they're nice
[42:52.120 --> 42:55.120]  The plan is to have the hotel ready
[42:55.120 --> 42:57.120]  For Illegal Alien Children
[42:57.120 --> 43:00.120]  By October 1st of the year
[43:00.120 --> 43:02.120]  A mere two and a half months from now, it is expected
[43:02.120 --> 43:04.120]  The average day will be about 15 days
[43:04.120 --> 43:07.120]  And I want people to go on the property
[43:07.120 --> 43:09.120]  They'll have some security guards say
[43:09.120 --> 43:11.120]  Go away or whatever
[43:11.120 --> 43:13.120]  Because they don't like seeing this
[43:13.120 --> 43:15.120]  I want somebody to go undercover
[43:15.120 --> 43:17.120]  I want to see the rooms, I want everything
[43:17.120 --> 43:19.120]  So just do decide who
[43:19.120 --> 43:21.120]  We're going to send right now on this
[43:21.120 --> 43:23.120]  I think Jakari is doing the news tonight
[43:25.120 --> 43:27.120]  I mean, I guess we could send Kit
[43:27.120 --> 43:29.120]  And Adon Salazar
[43:29.120 --> 43:31.120]  Or we could
[43:33.120 --> 43:35.120]  This is a big story, but I want to go down and show
[43:35.120 --> 43:37.120]  HD video of this to everybody
[43:37.120 --> 43:39.120]  We'll follow a report on this
[43:40.120 --> 43:43.120]  And it's in the Valley Morning Stars
[43:43.120 --> 43:45.120]  Where this originally broke
[43:45.120 --> 43:47.120]  So there you go
[43:50.120 --> 43:53.120]  I want to go shooting with Joe Biggs tomorrow
[43:53.120 --> 43:55.120]  But I think this is more important
[43:55.120 --> 43:57.120]  Because he can't get health care
[43:57.120 --> 44:00.120]  I think we probably need to send Joe
[44:00.120 --> 44:04.120]  We can go shoot with suppressed guns another time
[44:04.120 --> 44:06.120]  We're going to do a
[44:06.120 --> 44:09.120]  We do occasional second amendment shows
[44:09.120 --> 44:11.120]  And I was planning to do another one
[44:11.120 --> 44:13.120]  Because one of my buddies is into silencers
[44:13.120 --> 44:15.120]  And he's got a bunch
[44:15.120 --> 44:17.120]  He's going for a 50 cal, pretty awesome
[44:17.120 --> 44:20.120]  And went through all the federal stamp stuff
[44:20.120 --> 44:22.120]  And everything, obviously
[44:22.120 --> 44:24.120]  So we're going to go do an episode
[44:24.120 --> 44:26.120]  Just for fun and also for the viewers like it
[44:26.120 --> 44:28.120]  People have been asking for their brothers in arms
[44:28.120 --> 44:30.120]  So Shane and Sid and I are going to go out shooting tomorrow
[44:30.120 --> 44:34.120]  Tomorrow evening
[44:37.120 --> 44:39.120]  Got to keep the second amendment culture going
[44:39.120 --> 44:40.120]  It's one of the few things we've got
[44:40.120 --> 44:41.120]  That's why they want to kill it
[44:41.120 --> 44:43.120]  Because the right of people to be armed
[44:43.120 --> 44:45.120]  To defend themselves is a culture
[44:45.120 --> 44:47.120]  And the globalists have to override all cultures
[44:48.120 --> 44:49.120]  A big story
[44:49.120 --> 44:51.120]  FBI says three cartel members
[44:51.120 --> 44:54.120]  Are accused of kidnapping South Carolina man
[44:54.120 --> 44:56.120]  Mexican drug cartels
[44:56.120 --> 44:59.120]  They have thousands of kidnapings a year now
[44:59.120 --> 45:02.120]  I think the last number I saw was 4,000 plus
[45:02.120 --> 45:04.120]  In Phoenix that only had a few hundred a year
[45:04.120 --> 45:06.120]  Just a few years ago
[45:06.120 --> 45:08.120]  And it's like Mexico now
[45:08.120 --> 45:13.120]  And when Joe Arpaio does something about it
[45:13.120 --> 45:15.120]  And he does have some police state excesses
[45:15.120 --> 45:18.120]  But that's part of why the globalists are collapsing things
[45:18.120 --> 45:23.120]  Because then you've got to have a police state to deal with it
[45:23.120 --> 45:27.120]  But then he actually uses the police state
[45:27.120 --> 45:29.120]  To try to protect the public
[45:29.120 --> 45:30.120]  I'm not endorsing it
[45:30.120 --> 45:32.120]  That's what's happening by necessity
[45:32.120 --> 45:34.120]  And then the feds try to block him
[45:34.120 --> 45:37.120]  See, that's the thing about this tyranny
[45:37.120 --> 45:39.120]  But AP's making a big deal about it
[45:39.120 --> 45:41.120]  Because they still think it's a big deal in South Carolina
[45:41.120 --> 45:45.120]  To have Mexican drug cartels kidnapping people
[45:46.120 --> 45:48.120]  And then now the Mexican drug cartels
[45:48.120 --> 45:50.120]  Are having heydays in Chicago kidnapping
[45:50.120 --> 45:52.120]  And it's just kept quiet
[45:52.120 --> 45:55.120]  And the word is they pay the Chicago police
[45:55.120 --> 45:58.120]  A slice, of course
[45:58.120 --> 46:01.120]  And so they're allowed to do it
[46:01.120 --> 46:03.120]  Boy, watching this country roll over dead
[46:03.120 --> 46:06.120]  And rot in the sun is not a fun thing
[46:06.120 --> 46:10.120]  And the bad part is it's going to get a lot worse
[46:10.120 --> 46:13.120]  Ladies and gentlemen
[46:13.120 --> 46:15.120]  I don't know, down the road
[46:15.120 --> 46:17.120]  I mean, I guess I've said I'll never leave the country
[46:17.120 --> 46:23.120]  But I mean, what's the point if the country leaves me?
[46:23.120 --> 46:25.120]  I mean, it's like saying I'll never abandon my dog
[46:25.120 --> 46:30.120]  But if my dog died, I'm going to bury it
[46:30.120 --> 46:32.120]  But I don't want to talk like that
[46:32.120 --> 46:34.120]  Because I don't want to give up
[46:34.120 --> 46:36.120]  That's what they want to do is to moralize us
[46:36.120 --> 46:37.120]  And break our backs
[46:37.120 --> 46:39.120]  So let's just keep going as hard as we can
[46:39.120 --> 46:41.120]  And keep our commitments
[46:41.120 --> 46:44.120]  To try to be good people
[46:44.120 --> 46:49.120]  It's just so obvious that we shouldn't be going down this road
[46:49.120 --> 46:53.120]  And the political class just is a bunch of deviants
[46:53.120 --> 46:56.120]  They want to wreck everything
[46:56.120 --> 46:57.120]  Because they like to wreck things
[46:57.120 --> 46:59.120]  People say, why? Why?
[46:59.120 --> 47:03.120]  The average person goes, why would they stage a false flag to grab power?
[47:03.120 --> 47:05.120]  You know, again, why does this rape us rape women?
[47:05.120 --> 47:09.120]  Why does a psychopathic killer grab kids and torture them?
[47:09.120 --> 47:14.120]  I mean, it's what they like to do
[47:14.120 --> 47:16.120]  It's like, why do people mutilate themselves?
[47:16.120 --> 47:18.120]  It's what they like to do
[47:18.120 --> 47:19.120]  You or I don't get it
[47:19.120 --> 47:22.120]  We're like, why does that person chop their fingers off?
[47:22.120 --> 47:25.120]  Well, they think it's cool
[47:25.120 --> 47:27.120]  Why does that person mutilate themselves?
[47:27.120 --> 47:30.120]  Well, they think it's cool
[47:30.120 --> 47:34.120]  Why don't you be tolerant and accept it is the view they give us
[47:34.120 --> 47:36.120]  But that's not about being tolerant
[47:36.120 --> 47:38.120]  It's about us adopting
[47:38.120 --> 47:42.120]  First, it's be tolerant, then it's endorse, then it's adopt
[47:42.120 --> 47:44.120]  And I'm sorry
[47:44.120 --> 47:47.120]  I'm not going to adopt
[47:47.120 --> 47:49.120]  Abortion for birth control
[47:49.120 --> 47:52.120]  I'm not going to adopt GMO
[47:52.120 --> 47:55.120]  Just go with it when it kills the rats they feed it to on record
[47:55.120 --> 47:57.120]  Just across the board
[47:57.120 --> 47:59.120]  I'm not going to adopt glyphosate
[47:59.120 --> 48:03.120]  I'm not going to just adopt dying and rolling over in the ditch
[48:03.120 --> 48:07.120]  Because society at the top is run by psychopaths
[48:07.120 --> 48:11.120]  At the bottom, a bunch of decadent, disconnected people
[48:11.120 --> 48:13.120]  Living on borrowed time
[48:13.120 --> 48:16.120]  With wolves circling you
[48:16.120 --> 48:22.120]  We're going to go to Brighton, come back and talk to Rader, Jack, Brian, Phillip, Carl, and others
[48:22.120 --> 48:25.120]  Until the second segment of the next hour
[48:25.120 --> 48:28.120]  Then Abby Johnson is going to pop in for about 20, 30 minutes
[48:28.120 --> 48:30.120]  We'll go back to your calls
[48:30.120 --> 48:33.120]  And then she had to reschedule because her plane was late or something
[48:33.120 --> 48:35.120]  She didn't get to the phone in time
[48:35.120 --> 48:37.120]  It's understandable the way the airports are now
[48:37.120 --> 48:41.120]  Dr. Elvita King, niece of Martin Luther King
[48:41.120 --> 48:46.120]  Who's got a great new book that I was just sort of reading last weekend except my house right now, I read about a half of it
[48:46.120 --> 48:48.120]  It's on my kitchen table, I was reading it this morning
[48:48.120 --> 48:50.120]  King Rules
[48:50.120 --> 48:54.120]  10 truths for you and your family and our nation to prosper
[48:54.120 --> 48:56.120]  Really good book
[48:56.120 --> 48:59.120]  Medicine for a Sick Society and a Sick Culture
[48:59.120 --> 49:01.120]  So that's all coming up
[49:01.120 --> 49:03.120]  Briefly
[49:03.120 --> 49:08.120]  I always forget to do this and then end up having to scramble here on air
[49:08.120 --> 49:12.120]  Glass of filtered cold water
[49:12.120 --> 49:16.120]  I have my survival shield, Supernation Iodine X2
[49:16.120 --> 49:21.120]  Reprioteri from Deep Earth, pure iodine crystals
[49:21.120 --> 49:27.120]  And I put the elixir in organic palm oil base
[49:27.120 --> 49:30.120]  And then I take the supermell vitality
[49:30.120 --> 49:34.120]  I was out a little late last night so I'm going to take an extra dose here
[49:34.120 --> 49:36.120]  I forgot to take it this morning
[49:36.120 --> 49:40.120]  Be sure and consult your physician before you take this stuff, this is not a game
[49:40.120 --> 49:42.120]  I don't put out crap and everybody knows that
[49:42.120 --> 49:48.120]  If you've tried this stuff, well everybody's pretty much a repeat customer because we're not selling crud
[49:48.120 --> 49:52.120]  This stuff's all very simple what it is but
[49:52.120 --> 49:58.120]  I found out in the supplement industry people just will not put out the quality
[49:58.120 --> 50:07.120]  I mean it cost us upwards of $20 a bottle for some of these supplements and then we sell them for 40 bucks, 30 bucks, 50 bucks
[50:07.120 --> 50:15.120]  That's how much these concentrated organic oils, essential oils and concentrates and herbs are
[50:15.120 --> 50:18.120]  And the supermell vitality, the superfemell vitality
[50:18.120 --> 50:24.120]  And then of course the X2 just acts in my view from what I've researched from the doctors and others
[50:24.120 --> 50:29.120]  It's like an adjuvant accelerating the other herbs and things
[50:34.120 --> 50:42.120]  And even more importantly, it funds this operation, a savage, true assault on the New World Order
[50:42.120 --> 50:45.120]  A savage, true assault on tyranny
[50:45.120 --> 50:49.120]  Infowarslife.com is where you find these amazing supplements
[50:49.120 --> 50:55.120]  And where you dump gas in our gas tank for rampage over the enemy operations
[50:55.120 --> 51:24.120]  I'm Alex Jones, stay with us
[51:25.120 --> 51:28.120]  Happiness is 5starsoap.com
[51:56.120 --> 52:00.120]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information
[52:00.120 --> 52:05.120]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at MyPatriotSupply
[52:05.120 --> 52:08.120]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two bedroom apartment
[52:08.120 --> 52:10.120]  Frustrated with the direction this country was headed
[52:10.120 --> 52:13.120]  And the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck
[52:13.120 --> 52:18.120]  Deciding to take action, a company run by patriots for patriots was born
[52:18.120 --> 52:22.120]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding
[52:22.120 --> 52:28.120]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hardworking American men and women
[52:28.120 --> 52:31.120]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach
[52:31.120 --> 52:37.120]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high quality, storable foods from MyPatriotSupply
[52:37.120 --> 52:40.120]  Go to MyPatriotsupply.com slash Alex today
[52:40.120 --> 52:48.120]  For special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927
[52:48.120 --> 52:52.120]  That's 866-229-0927

[52:54.120 --> 53:19.120]  MyPatriotSupply.com slash Alex
[53:24.120 --> 53:30.120]  Teenagers like me used to think our parents were just weird
[53:30.120 --> 53:34.120]  Because they put their phones and computers inside those flimsy little fake leather cases
[53:34.120 --> 53:37.120]  Then my folks both got a blocket pocket
[53:37.120 --> 53:40.120]  Mom knows it keeps her safe from the phone's radiation
[53:40.120 --> 53:42.120]  Dad knows it keeps his information private
[53:42.120 --> 53:45.120]  I like my blocket pocket because it blocks hacking and tracking
[53:45.120 --> 53:46.120]  Awesome
[53:46.120 --> 53:49.120]  BlocketPocket.com has other cool stuff too
[53:49.120 --> 53:54.120]  Huh, guess my parents aren't so weird. Get your blocket pocket at BlocketPocket.com
[54:20.120 --> 54:24.120]  Alright, let's go right to your phone calls here
[54:24.120 --> 54:27.120]  And again, if I sound really negative and dark
[54:27.120 --> 54:30.120]  It's because the world is getting very dark, is getting very evil
[54:30.120 --> 54:33.120]  We have to recognize it to avoid it
[54:33.120 --> 54:40.120]  Just like I told the story a few days ago of what happened this weekend where a car came out of its lane
[54:40.120 --> 54:45.120]  I looked instinctively, didn't see anything on the curb
[54:45.120 --> 54:49.120]  Drove up just on my wheels, up on the curb
[54:49.120 --> 54:53.120]  But looked about 30 feet down, there was a couple walking with their back to me
[54:53.120 --> 54:55.120]  And so they just put second decision
[54:55.120 --> 54:58.120]  Okay, I'm going back over into that lane
[54:58.120 --> 55:01.120]  I'm just going to run into this car if I have to, I'm not going to run these people over
[55:01.120 --> 55:04.120]  At least that person's in a car, it wasn't even a thought, it was just
[55:04.120 --> 55:06.120]  Oh god, there's people, I gotta go back over
[55:06.120 --> 55:11.120]  Luckily that car had gone back into its lane
[55:11.120 --> 55:14.120]  So it's not negative to say, oh my gosh, there are people right there
[55:14.120 --> 55:16.120]  I don't want to run them over
[55:16.120 --> 55:20.120]  It's positive to be honest about what was happening
[55:20.120 --> 55:22.120]  To stop living in denial
[55:22.120 --> 55:26.120]  And I know I'm stating incredibly obvious things folks, but we're in trouble, okay
[55:26.120 --> 55:29.120]  This is beyond anything we've ever seen
[55:29.120 --> 55:32.120]  And it's going to get a lot worse very fast
[55:32.120 --> 55:37.120]  The elite think we're so stupid, they're publicly funding Al Qaeda worldwide
[55:37.120 --> 55:41.120]  Publicly, it's in the news now
[55:41.120 --> 55:45.120]  And the media reports it in the back of the paper like it's no big deal
[55:45.120 --> 55:48.120]  Like they're reporting on the weather or something
[55:48.120 --> 55:51.120]  The price of tea in China
[55:51.120 --> 55:54.120]  I know I said I'd go to your calls, I'm just really freaked out
[55:54.120 --> 56:00.120]  Because if they get away with all this, I mean, man, it's moving quicker than I thought
[56:00.120 --> 56:06.120]  Let's go to Jack in FEMA region too, I guess that's farmally up there in the northeast somewhere
[56:06.120 --> 56:09.120]  What farmer state are you in?
[56:09.120 --> 56:10.120]  New York
[56:10.120 --> 56:13.120]  Oh, so you're in former New York, alright
[56:13.120 --> 56:15.120]  What's on your mind today, Jack?
[56:15.120 --> 56:20.120]  Okay, well, I've been listening to you for
[56:20.120 --> 56:23.120]  I'm a little nervous, so bear with me
[56:23.120 --> 56:24.120]  It's okay, brother
[56:24.120 --> 56:29.120]  I'm not used to talking on the telephone or on the radio
[56:29.120 --> 56:30.120]  Got it
[56:30.120 --> 56:34.120]  But I've noticed a few things
[56:34.120 --> 56:41.120]  I've been listening to you for over 10 years, probably more like 15, 16 years
[56:41.120 --> 56:48.120]  And I can't no longer afford, unfortunately, to be a member
[56:48.120 --> 56:51.120]  I've tried, but I live in a fixed income
[56:51.120 --> 56:53.120]  Well, I totally understand, sir
[56:53.120 --> 56:56.120]  I mean, everything that's on PrisonPlanet.tv
[56:56.120 --> 57:01.120]  You get it first there being a member, and it's 5.95 a month
[57:01.120 --> 57:07.120]  But everything ends up being free on YouTube, InfoWars, and PrisonPlanet within a day or so
[57:07.120 --> 57:12.120]  So please, anyone, don't feel obligated to be a PrisonPlanet.tv member
[57:12.120 --> 57:17.120]  In fact, I'm going to give you our customer service number
[57:17.120 --> 57:23.120]  In fact, I'm going to say this right now, I want to create an email and a customer service number code
[57:23.120 --> 57:26.120]  That if people call, we will give you a code
[57:26.120 --> 57:29.120]  And I'm just going to give you a membership, sir, okay?
[57:29.120 --> 57:34.120]  Anyone else that wants a membership, you can just call here and we will give you one
[57:34.120 --> 57:38.120]  Okay, so make sure that gets set up, make sure they know
[57:38.120 --> 57:41.120]  And then we can have original codes we create that we give people
[57:41.120 --> 57:44.120]  Okay, so go ahead and get your points, sir
[57:44.120 --> 57:50.120]  Okay, a couple things that one thing is in watching you
[57:50.120 --> 57:56.120]  I've noticed that you've never commented, I'm sure you know about this, but I've never heard you comment on it
[57:56.120 --> 58:03.120]  That doesn't mean you haven't, but the IMF and the World Bank and their shenanigans
[58:03.120 --> 58:11.120]  When I was in college working on my master's degree, which I subsequently gave up when Bush got elected
[58:11.120 --> 58:16.120]  But because I could see the handwriting on the wall
[58:16.120 --> 58:23.120]  But anyway, there are what's called structural adjustment programs
[58:23.120 --> 58:28.120]  Yeah, that's where they tell a country what to do to get the money and its dictatorship
[58:28.120 --> 58:31.120]  Just stay there, tell folks about it, we're back in one minute
[58:31.120 --> 58:36.120]  And we're going to get to everybody, we're going to get to Phillip and Michael and Carl and Trish
[58:36.120 --> 58:54.120]  Don't hang up, Jack, I'm coming back to you
[59:06.120 --> 59:08.120]  Are the ones responsible
[59:08.120 --> 59:10.120]  Prime Directive did his credit, Alex Jones
[59:10.120 --> 59:13.120]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theory
[59:13.120 --> 59:16.120]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called Info Wars
[59:16.120 --> 59:19.120]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail
[59:19.120 --> 59:20.120]  These people are assaulting us
[59:20.120 --> 59:23.120]  Targeting of patriots engaged
[59:23.120 --> 59:27.120]  They are never going to stop, they're never going to deviate from their program
[59:27.120 --> 59:29.120]  Until we stop them
[59:29.120 --> 59:36.120]  Block free iphone at infowars.com, block free podcast and video feed
[59:36.120 --> 59:39.120]  Imperatives, destroy the planet TV
[59:39.120 --> 59:44.120]  You got a censor eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out
[59:44.120 --> 1:00:00.120]  Naturally it's for God you can fail it
[1:00:00.120 --> 1:00:17.120]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups
[1:00:17.120 --> 1:00:35.120]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones
[1:00:35.120 --> 1:00:39.120]  Alright, Jack, stolen from FEMA Region 2, formerly New York
[1:00:39.120 --> 1:00:42.120]  Now one of the main globalist command bases
[1:00:42.120 --> 1:00:45.120]  Where gun confiscation has begun
[1:00:45.120 --> 1:00:47.120]  Jack, you were bringing up structural adjustments
[1:00:47.120 --> 1:00:49.120]  Tell folks about the IMF and World Bank
[1:00:49.120 --> 1:00:53.120]  Okay, well, the IMF and the World Bank
[1:00:53.120 --> 1:00:57.120]  They loan money to third world nations
[1:00:57.120 --> 1:01:04.120]  But debtor nations, nations whose currency is devalued
[1:01:04.120 --> 1:01:10.120]  And has reached the point where the United States has reached now
[1:01:10.120 --> 1:01:14.120]  Where we have to borrow money just to pay down the interest on
[1:01:14.120 --> 1:01:16.120]  And the countries are deliberately maneuvered into that
[1:01:16.120 --> 1:01:19.120]  That's come out in mainstream news for decades
[1:01:19.120 --> 1:01:25.120]  Absolutely, and so one of the things, the result of this is that
[1:01:25.120 --> 1:01:31.120]  Our representatives have been taken captive by this by treaty
[1:01:31.120 --> 1:01:37.120]  And therefore, if we want to pay down our debt
[1:01:37.120 --> 1:01:40.120]  Or at least even the interest on it
[1:01:40.120 --> 1:01:48.120]  Our representatives are forced to include the structural adjustment programs
[1:01:48.120 --> 1:01:53.120]  Which if you read down them, you can go to the World Bank site
[1:01:53.120 --> 1:01:57.120]  Or the IMF site, and they are listed there
[1:01:57.120 --> 1:02:00.120]  It's shot therapy, all of it
[1:02:00.120 --> 1:02:02.120]  It's the whole New World Order agenda
[1:02:02.120 --> 1:02:04.120]  The countries are under a banking dictatorship
[1:02:04.120 --> 1:02:06.120]  Yes, we should do more stories on that
[1:02:06.120 --> 1:02:08.120]  We have covered it, I've actually made films on it
[1:02:08.120 --> 1:02:11.120]  And no, it's all public, that's what I'm saying
[1:02:11.120 --> 1:02:14.120]  I mean, they tell the countries, take the guns, break up the families
[1:02:14.120 --> 1:02:17.120]  Devalue your currency, take on more debt
[1:02:17.120 --> 1:02:19.120]  Give us your infrastructure for nothing
[1:02:19.120 --> 1:02:22.120]  And they're loaning them fiat SDRs
[1:02:22.120 --> 1:02:26.120]  That's why they signed us on to the trillions and derivatives that aren't even our debt
[1:02:26.120 --> 1:02:30.120]  So they can tell us that we're in debt to these people
[1:02:30.120 --> 1:02:32.120]  Absolutely, it's amazing
[1:02:32.120 --> 1:02:36.120]  Very interesting, listen, call the number
[1:02:36.120 --> 1:02:41.120]  Here's the problem, we have a 1-800 line that we don't answer during the day for the orders
[1:02:41.120 --> 1:02:45.120]  Until when it rolls over, you get our people here
[1:02:45.120 --> 1:02:49.120]  So I haven't had time yet to tell the operators that are here in Austin as well
[1:02:49.120 --> 1:02:55.120]  Hey, give people a free prisonplanet.tv membership if they can't afford it
[1:02:55.120 --> 1:03:00.120]  I mean, I don't want people that can't afford a prisonplanet.tv membership
[1:03:00.120 --> 1:03:03.120]  As long as I'm able to pay for the bandwidth, which we are right now
[1:03:03.120 --> 1:03:08.120]  My goal is just to get people to see the nightly news and the films and show it to friends and family
[1:03:08.120 --> 1:03:19.120]  So if you call by this afternoon or by tomorrow, because I've got to develop a system
[1:03:19.120 --> 1:03:22.120]  And then I've got to make sure it's announced right or it'll cause a problem
[1:03:22.120 --> 1:03:30.120]  And then we can get it where if you can't afford a prisonplanet.tv membership, you can call here and we will give you one
[1:03:30.120 --> 1:03:38.120]  The people that are members know they're doing it to support the overall operation that 90% of it's free
[1:03:38.120 --> 1:03:43.120]  And so we just have to make money to fund ourselves
[1:03:43.120 --> 1:03:51.120]  The money is not the goal, the money is the fuel, is the sales on the ship that get us to destination liberty
[1:03:51.120 --> 1:04:01.120]  Freedom, harbor, independence, freedom, consciousness, free will, not synthetic consciousness
[1:04:01.120 --> 1:04:06.120]  That's the great jewel, that's the great object
[1:04:06.120 --> 1:04:16.120]  The money is wind in the sails and I do not want poor people ever basically donating to this broadcast
[1:04:16.120 --> 1:04:21.120]  We used to have money bombs and things, we developed other ways to raise the capital here
[1:04:21.120 --> 1:04:25.120]  It's about people that have given
[1:04:25.120 --> 1:04:31.120]  But we've set it up in a free market system where you get one of the best water filters out there at the lowest price
[1:04:31.120 --> 1:04:36.120]  Like Pro Pure with the G2 filters and help the broadcast to help yourself
[1:04:36.120 --> 1:04:42.120]  See I believe in win-wins, in fact that's what I live by
[1:04:42.120 --> 1:04:47.120]  I mean I call it superstition whenever you want, I will not screw anybody
[1:04:47.120 --> 1:04:50.120]  Just I will not do it
[1:04:50.120 --> 1:05:12.120]  Unless you've got me cornered and then I don't even do it out of spite I will crush you as fast as I can to continue my mission
[1:05:21.120 --> 1:05:27.120]  VPA containers, contaminated tap water and other toxic substances found in our environment
[1:05:27.120 --> 1:05:31.120]  Experts know our bodies are suffering and being thrown off balance
[1:05:31.120 --> 1:05:36.120]  Especially when it comes to your natural systems, forget synthetic chemicals
[1:05:36.120 --> 1:05:44.120]  Superfemale vitality brings forward key herbs specifically chosen for women's biology without the use of phony additives

[1:05:59.120 --> 1:06:02.120]  Alex Jones here for infowars.com
[1:06:02.120 --> 1:06:09.120]  In the month of July we have got giant specials on everything at maiden1776.com
[1:06:09.120 --> 1:06:14.120]  The already discounted maiden1776 t-shirts are only 1776
[1:06:14.120 --> 1:06:19.120]  We have the new belt buckles that in only two weeks of sale are very close to selling out
[1:06:19.120 --> 1:06:21.120]  There's only 500 of each
[1:06:21.120 --> 1:06:25.120]  We're talking about maiden America belt buckles and nickel brass
[1:06:25.120 --> 1:06:27.120]  This is more than a summer blowout special
[1:06:27.120 --> 1:06:30.120]  This is a new declaration of independence
[1:06:30.120 --> 1:06:36.120]  But to expand the info orb we are offering the equivalent of more than five months free
[1:06:36.120 --> 1:06:42.120]  Right now when you get a membership at PrisonPlanet.tv for a limited time only $39.95 a year
[1:06:42.120 --> 1:06:46.120]  That's more than five months free off the regular price
[1:06:46.120 --> 1:06:52.120]  Not just this July 4th weekend, but the entire month of July at maiden1776.com
[1:06:52.120 --> 1:06:58.120]  Molan Labe, you can take my gun from my cold dead hands
[1:06:58.120 --> 1:07:03.120]  City of Austin tap water versus filtered City of Austin tap water
[1:07:03.120 --> 1:07:04.120]  I taste dirt in it
[1:07:04.120 --> 1:07:05.120]  God knows what's in this
[1:07:05.120 --> 1:07:09.120]  These people just sampled City of Austin tap water straight from the faucet
[1:07:09.120 --> 1:07:15.120]  Next we had them try a sample of tap water filtered with a Pro Pure G2.0 filtration system
[1:07:15.120 --> 1:07:16.120]  Now when it is better
[1:07:16.120 --> 1:07:17.120]  Tastes like nothing
[1:07:17.120 --> 1:07:19.120]  Yep, I know what good water tastes like, it's good water
[1:07:19.120 --> 1:07:25.120]  Most tap water contains added substances like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate and many others
[1:07:25.120 --> 1:07:29.120]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues
[1:07:29.120 --> 1:07:32.120]  Including tooth decay, lower in IQ and even cancer
[1:07:32.120 --> 1:07:35.120]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're in tap water
[1:07:35.120 --> 1:07:40.120]  The Pro Pure G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances
[1:07:40.120 --> 1:07:43.120]  Leaving only fresh tasting, deliciously clean water
[1:07:43.120 --> 1:07:45.120]  Okay, this is very tasty
[1:07:45.120 --> 1:07:46.120]  It's good water, refreshing
[1:07:46.120 --> 1:07:47.120]  It's good
[1:07:47.120 --> 1:07:49.120]  Go to infowarsstore.com today

[1:07:58.120 --> 1:08:03.120]  He's the T-Rex of Political Talk
[1:08:03.120 --> 1:08:07.120]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[1:08:19.120 --> 1:08:22.120]  Alright folks, we're continuing with your phone calls
[1:08:22.120 --> 1:08:28.120]  Right now, the toll free number to join us is 800-259-9231
[1:08:28.120 --> 1:08:31.120]  Throughout this hour, both guests are actually in the next hour
[1:08:31.120 --> 1:08:34.120]  I've looked at the sheet wrong
[1:08:34.120 --> 1:08:35.120]  Let me just do this
[1:08:35.120 --> 1:08:37.120]  Let me just read headlines now that I haven't gotten to
[1:08:37.120 --> 1:08:39.120]  And then I'll go right to your calls
[1:08:39.120 --> 1:08:40.120]  Let me read a few here
[1:08:40.120 --> 1:08:43.120]  Because some stations just joined us that are too insane to believe but are true
[1:08:43.120 --> 1:08:45.120]  And I'm sending reporters there today
[1:08:45.120 --> 1:08:49.120]  I'm going to send Joe Biggs and Don Salazar today
[1:08:49.120 --> 1:08:51.120]  Down there
[1:08:51.120 --> 1:08:55.120]  Feds to open $50 million resort free legal children
[1:08:55.120 --> 1:08:57.120]  Complete with tennis courts, saunas and pools
[1:08:57.120 --> 1:09:00.120]  That's three hours away from Austin
[1:09:00.120 --> 1:09:05.120]  And this is nicer than most of the places I've lived in my life
[1:09:05.120 --> 1:09:09.120]  So pretty incredible kidnappings are exploding all over the U.S.
[1:09:09.120 --> 1:09:11.120]  But the Mexican drug cartels
[1:09:11.120 --> 1:09:15.120]  I mean, it's just the destabilization of America
[1:09:15.120 --> 1:09:18.120]  You don't think the globalists just want to destabilize other countries, do you?
[1:09:18.120 --> 1:09:21.120]  They want to destabilize this nation
[1:09:21.120 --> 1:09:26.120]  And then George Soros brags that he started with five billion state department dollars
[1:09:26.120 --> 1:09:30.120]  The Ukrainian overthrow of an elected government
[1:09:30.120 --> 1:09:35.120]  And you're supposedly a pro-Russia trader in the media
[1:09:35.120 --> 1:09:38.120]  If you don't support to start a World War III
[1:09:38.120 --> 1:09:42.120]  I mean, if you don't support basically suicide
[1:09:42.120 --> 1:09:47.120]  And the world is faced by the madness of the elite
[1:09:47.120 --> 1:09:55.120]  636,000 vets wait a month or more for doctors' appointments
[1:09:55.120 --> 1:09:59.120]  8,000 have been waiting for months to see a doctor
[1:09:59.120 --> 1:10:02.120]  Including people with things like brain tumors that will kill them
[1:10:02.120 --> 1:10:05.120]  That's in USA today and that's a whitewash number
[1:10:05.120 --> 1:10:08.120]  And I was watching so-called whistleblowers a few days ago
[1:10:08.120 --> 1:10:13.120]  On Monday in the VA scandal and it's like, we really screwed up and shouldn't have covered it up
[1:10:13.120 --> 1:10:16.120]  We messed up, we just couldn't give the care
[1:10:16.120 --> 1:10:19.120]  No, it's designed to give run around
[1:10:19.120 --> 1:10:21.120]  They can privatize it at any time
[1:10:21.120 --> 1:10:25.120]  It's designed on record to euthanize these people
[1:10:25.120 --> 1:10:27.120]  They're called death panels
[1:10:27.120 --> 1:10:30.120]  It's a death list
[1:10:30.120 --> 1:10:37.120]  And everybody from Rahm Emanuel's brother Ezekiel to Bill Gates is on record
[1:10:37.120 --> 1:10:41.120]  Saying they want to kill people that are no longer used to society
[1:10:41.120 --> 1:10:44.120]  That's the mindset of a quote liberal
[1:10:44.120 --> 1:10:48.120]  Oh, an old lady's not useful, let's just euthanize her
[1:10:48.120 --> 1:10:50.120]  Isn't that liberal?
[1:10:50.120 --> 1:10:56.120]  Because young, dumb yuppies are told you're gonna get a pay raise if we can kill people
[1:10:56.120 --> 1:10:58.120]  Because they don't know you just grow the pie
[1:10:58.120 --> 1:11:01.120]  They don't know you're making an economy out of taking care of old people
[1:11:01.120 --> 1:11:06.120]  They don't know that if they let them kill old people and kill vets, they're gonna get their asses killed
[1:11:06.120 --> 1:11:07.120]  Excuse me
[1:11:07.120 --> 1:11:11.120]  See, I've been trying to not get mad all day and I apologize and I'm not trying to talk like that
[1:11:11.120 --> 1:11:13.120]  And I'm gonna stop it, okay?
[1:11:13.120 --> 1:11:17.120]  I am just sick of it and I want to punch those people in the nose
[1:11:17.120 --> 1:11:19.120]  I'm sick of them
[1:11:19.120 --> 1:11:21.120]  I can't even be around them anymore
[1:11:21.120 --> 1:11:23.120]  They wear their arrogance like an armor
[1:11:23.120 --> 1:11:25.120]  They wear their stupidity like a shield
[1:11:25.120 --> 1:11:27.120]  I want to stomp their heads in
[1:11:29.120 --> 1:11:30.120]  Excuse me
[1:11:30.120 --> 1:11:33.120]  Immoral, self-centered, weak crap
[1:11:37.120 --> 1:11:38.120]  Anyways
[1:11:38.120 --> 1:11:42.120]  People say, now this guy's weird
[1:11:42.120 --> 1:11:44.120]  Or they say, oh, Alex Jones is fake that he gets angry
[1:11:44.120 --> 1:11:49.120]  No, man, I am worried everything is falling apart
[1:11:49.120 --> 1:11:51.120]  We're killing old people all over the country
[1:11:51.120 --> 1:11:55.120]  I would interview Wesley Smith of the Wall Street Journal writer and best-selling author
[1:11:55.120 --> 1:11:57.120]  I'd probably interviewed him 20 times over the years
[1:11:57.120 --> 1:11:59.120]  I want to get him back on
[1:11:59.120 --> 1:12:01.120]  It's been years
[1:12:02.120 --> 1:12:04.120]  I think the word is Rupert Murrock told him not to come on the show
[1:12:04.120 --> 1:12:06.120]  Anybody affiliated with news scores told him not to come on
[1:12:06.120 --> 1:12:08.120]  I've been told that by a bunch of people on record
[1:12:08.120 --> 1:12:12.120]  Napolitano, Lou Dobbs is a regular listener
[1:12:12.120 --> 1:12:14.120]  He's been told not to come on
[1:12:14.120 --> 1:12:16.120]  I'll just say all the names, it's not a secret
[1:12:16.120 --> 1:12:18.120]  I don't know why I don't ever talk about it
[1:12:18.120 --> 1:12:20.120]  Who's the other ones?
[1:12:20.120 --> 1:12:22.120]  Who's one of these beyond Hannity and Combs?
[1:12:22.120 --> 1:12:24.120]  Combs, same deal
[1:12:27.120 --> 1:12:31.120]  Whatever, the point is, is Fox can do whatever they want, it's their company
[1:12:31.120 --> 1:12:37.120]  I don't know how I just digressed off into all that
[1:12:37.120 --> 1:12:39.120]  Oh, yeah, Wesley Smith
[1:12:39.120 --> 1:12:43.120]  I think that's why he won't come on, so I forgot about that
[1:12:43.120 --> 1:12:47.120]  Anyways, he tells the stories where he's there
[1:12:47.120 --> 1:12:51.120]  And these old people and folks that are paralyzed neck down are begging
[1:12:51.120 --> 1:12:53.120]  Let me have water, please
[1:12:53.120 --> 1:12:56.120]  And the state takes the water away for 14 days on average and they die
[1:12:56.120 --> 1:12:58.120]  With blood coming out of their mouth
[1:12:58.120 --> 1:13:03.120]  Because everything dries and blood starts pouring out your nose, out your ears, out your eyes
[1:13:03.120 --> 1:13:05.120]  And they're just like, begging, please, I'll beg
[1:13:05.120 --> 1:13:08.120]  It's just savage murder operations everywhere
[1:13:08.120 --> 1:13:13.120]  It's so over the top, people
[1:13:13.120 --> 1:13:16.120]  I mean, it's just savage evil everywhere
[1:13:16.120 --> 1:13:19.120]  And no one even knows, no one even cares
[1:13:19.120 --> 1:13:24.120]  He tells the story of one guy who was even able to bowl
[1:13:24.120 --> 1:13:29.120]  In the wreck area of the little, you know, after what they call that parlor bowling or whatever
[1:13:29.120 --> 1:13:30.120]  It's only like 20 feet
[1:13:30.120 --> 1:13:36.120]  The point is, he could, he was only partially paralyzed up to the, you know, from the chest down
[1:13:36.120 --> 1:13:38.120]  And one of his arms halfway worked
[1:13:38.120 --> 1:13:42.120]  And to prove, because he was then a ward of the state that he didn't need to be killed
[1:13:42.120 --> 1:13:44.120]  He would go down and bowl
[1:13:44.120 --> 1:13:46.120]  And the nurses said, yeah, we're sorry, but the orders are
[1:13:46.120 --> 1:13:49.120]  And they had to replace a few and they went ahead and took his water away
[1:13:49.120 --> 1:13:52.120]  And ran a black off on him
[1:13:52.120 --> 1:13:56.120]  I mean, this is our loving scum government in the bioethic system
[1:13:56.120 --> 1:13:58.120]  It's all collapsing right now
[1:13:58.120 --> 1:14:04.120]  And people that have money or middle class are sequestered in their little islands
[1:14:04.120 --> 1:14:09.120]  As the water is rising, and they're just happy that they're not in lower ground that got flooded
[1:14:09.120 --> 1:14:12.120]  Not understanding the water will rise to the level
[1:14:12.120 --> 1:14:16.120]  The water will rise to the last New World Order globalist alive
[1:14:16.120 --> 1:14:20.120]  If they bring in this technocracy and carry out their plan of exterminism
[1:14:20.120 --> 1:14:25.120]  And the last one will be betrayed and killed by the system
[1:14:25.120 --> 1:14:28.120]  That's the system that's being built
[1:14:28.120 --> 1:14:34.120]  So the consciousness of the evil can continue operating after humans have been killed
[1:14:34.120 --> 1:14:37.120]  Destroy the old creation, bring in the new
[1:14:37.120 --> 1:14:42.120]  A counterfeit hellraiser, Clive Barker overwrite of everything
[1:14:42.120 --> 1:14:45.120]  To institutionalize destruction
[1:14:45.120 --> 1:14:50.120]  To institutionalize tearing apart, trampling and being trampled
[1:14:50.120 --> 1:14:54.120]  To institutionalize ugliness
[1:14:54.120 --> 1:15:02.120]  To institutionalize reality inverted
[1:15:02.120 --> 1:15:05.120]  I said I'd go to your phone calls, I just can't get to these news articles
[1:15:05.120 --> 1:15:08.120]  I mean, I read this, it's like the illegals, and I'm not even against the illegals
[1:15:08.120 --> 1:15:12.120]  But it's an incentive, its flypaper has sugar on it
[1:15:12.120 --> 1:15:15.120]  Or has an enticement on it
[1:15:15.120 --> 1:15:23.120]  Just like a mousetrap or rat trap has cheese on it
[1:15:23.120 --> 1:15:29.120]  Or a little piece of tuna, or a little bit of peanut butter
[1:15:29.120 --> 1:15:35.120]  And so I don't dislike the poor humans coming in here who are desperate
[1:15:35.120 --> 1:15:39.120]  Fling a deeper level of globalist collapse and control
[1:15:39.120 --> 1:15:43.120]  They're coming in wanting the cheese
[1:15:43.120 --> 1:15:47.120]  And the trap won't slap down on them for a long time
[1:15:47.120 --> 1:15:50.120]  Because the trap's gonna slap them to all of us
[1:15:50.120 --> 1:15:55.120]  It's the old analogy of deer hunting
[1:15:55.120 --> 1:15:59.120]  When that spike comes out and you're eight years old
[1:15:59.120 --> 1:16:01.120]  And he's following some doe
[1:16:01.120 --> 1:16:05.120]  And you raise your rifle up, shoot it, and dad says, no, no, no
[1:16:05.120 --> 1:16:08.120]  There's a big buck, I guarantee you, out there waiting, you want a trophy
[1:16:08.120 --> 1:16:12.120]  And again, it's not even about killing the animal or getting the meat or whatever
[1:16:12.120 --> 1:16:15.120]  It's the ritual of being a human out hunting
[1:16:15.120 --> 1:16:19.120]  It activates your instincts, that's why it feels good, that's why you want to do it
[1:16:19.120 --> 1:16:26.120]  The collective memories, the epigenetics
[1:16:26.120 --> 1:16:31.120]  And then you wait, and then sure enough, here comes out that big buck and you get him
[1:16:31.120 --> 1:16:37.120]  You know, that big 12-point or whatever with that big rack
[1:16:37.120 --> 1:16:41.120]  And that's what they want, they want to get us all
[1:16:41.120 --> 1:16:44.120]  That's why they kill us slow with the ambient soft kill
[1:16:44.120 --> 1:16:46.120]  I'm ranting, I'm not gonna get to the news then
[1:16:46.120 --> 1:16:50.120]  I mean, look at this, the UK police arrest 660 suspected pedophiles
[1:16:50.120 --> 1:16:55.120]  National crime agency detains suspected child abusers including doctors, teachers
[1:16:55.120 --> 1:16:58.120]  And takes more than 400 children into care
[1:16:58.120 --> 1:17:01.120]  They're only doing this now
[1:17:01.120 --> 1:17:05.120]  Overall, even the police don't probably know this, they're compartmentalized
[1:17:05.120 --> 1:17:09.120]  And I predicted this would come to force England into the EU
[1:17:09.120 --> 1:17:12.120]  Because UKIP's about to pull them out
[1:17:12.120 --> 1:17:16.120]  And so this is all being allowed to be brought out selectively now
[1:17:16.120 --> 1:17:20.120]  In an inner fight between different power structures, because this has been going on forever
[1:17:20.120 --> 1:17:24.120]  And by the way, they're just gonna burn some low level people that are having sex with little kids
[1:17:24.120 --> 1:17:27.120]  And they should, they should be executed
[1:17:27.120 --> 1:17:29.120]  In my view, but the point is
[1:17:29.120 --> 1:17:33.120]  You can't trust the overall top of the pyramid to carry it out
[1:17:33.120 --> 1:17:35.120]  Because it's only burning small people
[1:17:35.120 --> 1:17:40.120]  They don't just rape children over there, they kill them
[1:17:40.120 --> 1:17:42.120]  They kill them everywhere
[1:17:42.120 --> 1:17:44.120]  Hell, they kill 53 million of them here
[1:17:44.120 --> 1:17:46.120]  Let's go to your calls here
[1:17:46.120 --> 1:17:48.120]  I mean, that's just the stacks of this news
[1:17:48.120 --> 1:17:51.120]  I mean, I've got hundreds of articles like this
[1:17:51.120 --> 1:17:54.120]  Of just the manifest evil
[1:17:54.120 --> 1:17:58.120]  And they've got prime ministers over there just slit and throw it to little kids
[1:17:58.120 --> 1:18:00.120]  I mean, it is unbelievable
[1:18:00.120 --> 1:18:04.120]  Let's go ahead and talk to Phillip in California, you're on the air
[1:18:04.120 --> 1:18:06.120]  Go ahead
[1:18:06.120 --> 1:18:07.120]  How you doing?
[1:18:07.120 --> 1:18:10.120]  I'm not doing too good envisioning
[1:18:11.120 --> 1:18:13.120]  I mean, just go ahead
[1:18:14.120 --> 1:18:21.120]  I would want to say welcome to Orwell's best novel that he never wrote
[1:18:21.120 --> 1:18:23.120]  Yeah, we're living it brother
[1:18:23.120 --> 1:18:28.120]  And I would also want to say is
[1:18:28.120 --> 1:18:31.120]  The current war happening with Russia and Ukraine
[1:18:31.120 --> 1:18:34.120]  Do you think that's the final chess piece in their board game?
[1:18:36.120 --> 1:18:37.120]  Yeah, that's it
[1:18:37.120 --> 1:18:40.120]  I mean, they're following Rosinski's plan to a T
[1:18:40.120 --> 1:18:42.120]  So they're, they have it in the plan
[1:18:42.120 --> 1:18:45.120]  That they're prepared to have a nuclear war with Russia as well
[1:18:45.120 --> 1:18:47.120]  Which is what the deviants want
[1:18:47.120 --> 1:18:50.120]  I mean, they, they're, people don't understand
[1:18:50.120 --> 1:18:51.120]  They might do it
[1:18:51.120 --> 1:18:53.120]  I mean, they're that evil
[1:18:53.120 --> 1:18:54.120]  If we're not able to restrain them
[1:18:54.120 --> 1:18:56.120]  I mean, it's, people ask
[1:18:56.120 --> 1:18:58.120]  What is the limit evil goes to?
[1:18:58.120 --> 1:19:01.120]  Absolute sub-zero
[1:19:01.120 --> 1:19:03.120]  Absolute, absolute maximum
[1:19:03.120 --> 1:19:05.120]  Whatever it can do
[1:19:06.120 --> 1:19:09.120]  Then we have Jen Talkie saying Russia's bombing its own town
[1:19:09.120 --> 1:19:11.120]  Yeah, I'm going to get to that in the stack
[1:19:11.120 --> 1:19:14.120]  The State Department says that Russia launched a false flag on itself
[1:19:14.120 --> 1:19:16.120]  I think that's very healthy
[1:19:16.120 --> 1:19:19.120]  And they might have, you know, governments do that
[1:19:19.120 --> 1:19:21.120]  Probably not
[1:19:21.120 --> 1:19:25.120]  But may have
[1:19:25.120 --> 1:19:27.120]  It's just that Russia wants the moral high ground
[1:19:27.120 --> 1:19:29.120]  Not because Russia's even good at the top
[1:19:29.120 --> 1:19:31.120]  They understand that's where the real power is at
[1:19:31.120 --> 1:19:33.120]  It's a more sophisticated system
[1:19:33.120 --> 1:19:36.120]  But I mean, the NATO launched the fake chemical attacks
[1:19:36.120 --> 1:19:38.120]  And got caught
[1:19:38.120 --> 1:19:42.120]  So they're the prime suspect to be doing stuff like this
[1:19:42.120 --> 1:19:44.120]  It could be a double false flag
[1:19:44.120 --> 1:19:47.120]  They could launch one and make it look like the Russians did it as well
[1:19:47.120 --> 1:19:49.120]  Great points, caller
[1:19:49.120 --> 1:19:51.120]  Carl, Michael, Dave, Truth, Raider

[1:24:28.120 --> 1:24:31.120]  Controlling the narrative
[1:24:31.120 --> 1:24:34.120]  Woman calls Chania Warcriminal C-Span cut speed
[1:24:34.120 --> 1:24:37.120]  And they're doing this more and more
[1:24:37.120 --> 1:24:41.120]  When Pelosi had it brought up to her about the NSA
[1:24:41.120 --> 1:24:44.120]  A month or so ago, we had the young man on
[1:24:44.120 --> 1:24:46.120]  Teenager
[1:24:46.120 --> 1:24:48.120]  He just asked her polite questions about it
[1:24:48.120 --> 1:24:50.120]  And pointed out that she'd been lying
[1:24:50.120 --> 1:24:54.120]  They weren't going to release that to him
[1:24:54.120 --> 1:24:57.120]  Even though they were making a documentary with him
[1:24:57.120 --> 1:25:01.120]  And they said in the memo, well, we don't want to upset Pelosi
[1:25:01.120 --> 1:25:04.120]  These are public events, this is what C-Span covers
[1:25:04.120 --> 1:25:06.120]  This is what happens
[1:25:06.120 --> 1:25:09.120]  This is a big deal
[1:25:09.120 --> 1:25:11.120]  Because we know the corporate media does this stuff
[1:25:11.120 --> 1:25:14.120]  But this is the C-Span
[1:25:14.120 --> 1:25:17.120]  While they hold out that they're not like that
[1:25:17.120 --> 1:25:21.120]  And the young man, his credit is very upset about it
[1:25:21.120 --> 1:25:23.120]  He talked about it in the news
[1:25:23.120 --> 1:25:27.120]  But he doesn't control C-Span anymore
[1:25:27.120 --> 1:25:31.120]  And this ties into the EAS and Obama's kill switch
[1:25:31.120 --> 1:25:33.120]  We're going to talk about it after we take calls
[1:25:33.120 --> 1:25:35.120]  But they're doing it
[1:25:35.120 --> 1:25:37.120]  And then next is cutting me off
[1:25:37.120 --> 1:25:39.120]  And believe me, we deal with government sponsored hacks
[1:25:39.120 --> 1:25:41.120]  Denial of services
[1:25:41.120 --> 1:25:43.120]  Harassment you wouldn't believe
[1:25:43.120 --> 1:25:45.120]  To bring you this broadcast
[1:25:45.120 --> 1:25:47.120]  Whether or not fight the system
[1:25:47.120 --> 1:25:52.120]  Folks, we're a major capital ship in this fight
[1:25:52.120 --> 1:25:54.120]  Against the tyrants, we're a big target up front
[1:25:54.120 --> 1:25:56.120]  They got their guns on us
[1:25:56.120 --> 1:25:58.120]  There are so many people fighting tyranny now
[1:25:58.120 --> 1:26:02.120]  That most people encounter no opposition at this point
[1:26:02.120 --> 1:26:04.120]  That's why the battle is so hot right now
[1:26:04.120 --> 1:26:07.120]  Is the globalists know they've got us burning
[1:26:07.120 --> 1:26:09.120]  They're burning worse right now
[1:26:09.120 --> 1:26:11.120]  They just hope they can wreck the whole system
[1:26:11.120 --> 1:26:15.120]  Poses saviors and grab victory from the jaws of defeat
[1:26:19.120 --> 1:26:21.120]  It's just such an epic time to be alive
[1:26:21.120 --> 1:26:23.120]  I just keep pausing this
[1:26:23.120 --> 1:26:25.120]  In my mind it's just pounding
[1:26:25.120 --> 1:26:28.120]  Epic, epic, epic, epic, epic
[1:26:28.120 --> 1:26:30.120]  And it's such an age of new media
[1:26:30.120 --> 1:26:32.120]  And a return of journalism
[1:26:32.120 --> 1:26:35.120]  We've got a special report coming up tomorrow
[1:26:35.120 --> 1:26:37.120]  About Matt Rudge, it's going to be very powerful
[1:26:37.120 --> 1:26:39.120]  We're going to air...
[1:26:39.120 --> 1:26:41.120]  Who we got on tomorrow
[1:26:41.120 --> 1:26:42.120]  Because I want to find a space to air it
[1:26:42.120 --> 1:26:44.120]  It's about 12 minutes long so far
[1:26:44.120 --> 1:26:47.120]  It's a condensed report from his speech in 1998
[1:26:47.120 --> 1:26:49.120]  Everything he said came true
[1:26:49.120 --> 1:26:51.120]  Just exactly as he said it would
[1:26:51.120 --> 1:26:56.120]  True folk hero, true trailblazer
[1:26:56.120 --> 1:26:58.120]  It's just exciting
[1:26:58.120 --> 1:27:01.120]  I'm excited about reality
[1:27:01.120 --> 1:27:03.120]  Let's go to Carl in Washington
[1:27:03.120 --> 1:27:06.120]  You're on the air, go ahead
[1:27:06.120 --> 1:27:08.120]  Hello Alex, keep up the good work
[1:27:08.120 --> 1:27:10.120]  Thanks for holding brother, go ahead
[1:27:10.120 --> 1:27:16.120]  The globalist new world agenda is advancing
[1:27:16.120 --> 1:27:19.120]  They have to get rid of people like you and me
[1:27:19.120 --> 1:27:22.120]  The people that are true patriots
[1:27:22.120 --> 1:27:26.120]  The people that are freedom loving individuals
[1:27:26.120 --> 1:27:27.120]  People that aren't suicidal
[1:27:27.120 --> 1:27:30.120]  People that like healthy happy families
[1:27:30.120 --> 1:27:32.120]  And who like nice farms
[1:27:32.120 --> 1:27:34.120]  And who never get tired of a cheeseburger
[1:27:34.120 --> 1:27:36.120]  And never get tired of being nice to people
[1:27:36.120 --> 1:27:39.120]  And never get tired of playing poker with their buddies
[1:27:39.120 --> 1:27:41.120]  You know, we're the type of people that don't want to kidnap kids
[1:27:41.120 --> 1:27:42.120]  And torture them to death
[1:27:42.120 --> 1:27:44.120]  We're the type of folks that don't like abortion
[1:27:44.120 --> 1:27:46.120]  We're the type of folks that like being able to defend ourselves
[1:27:46.120 --> 1:27:47.120]  You mean those type of folks?
[1:27:47.120 --> 1:27:49.120]  Yeah, that's what terrors, yeah
[1:27:49.120 --> 1:27:51.120]  Terrors, yeah, yeah
[1:27:51.120 --> 1:27:52.120]  People that don't commit crimes
[1:27:52.120 --> 1:27:53.120]  People you can trust
[1:27:53.120 --> 1:27:54.120]  People that are honorable
[1:27:54.120 --> 1:27:55.120]  People that are good
[1:27:55.120 --> 1:27:56.120]  Yeah, the bad guys, yeah
[1:27:56.120 --> 1:27:57.120]  Oh, you mean us, yeah, go ahead
[1:27:57.120 --> 1:27:59.120]  Yeah, absolutely
[1:27:59.120 --> 1:28:01.120]  You know, the other day
[1:28:01.120 --> 1:28:04.120]  You were reporting on the train
[1:28:04.120 --> 1:28:06.120]  That derailed in Mexico
[1:28:06.120 --> 1:28:08.120]  And there was a thousand individuals
[1:28:08.120 --> 1:28:10.120]  Or more that happened to be all over the train
[1:28:10.120 --> 1:28:12.120]  The death train from 1300, yeah
[1:28:12.120 --> 1:28:16.120]  Right, well, take that train
[1:28:16.120 --> 1:28:20.120]  Multiply it by three or four per day
[1:28:20.120 --> 1:28:23.120]  And that's what's coming into the United States
[1:28:23.120 --> 1:28:24.120]  Actually, I looked it up
[1:28:24.120 --> 1:28:27.120]  It's more than a dozen major cargo trains
[1:28:27.120 --> 1:28:29.120]  With people on them a day
[1:28:29.120 --> 1:28:30.120]  There you go
[1:28:30.120 --> 1:28:33.120]  I just wanted to kind of give you an advance
[1:28:33.120 --> 1:28:34.120]  Really what's happening
[1:28:34.120 --> 1:28:36.120]  We're talking multi-millions of individuals
[1:28:36.120 --> 1:28:39.120]  Coming into this country with open borders
[1:28:39.120 --> 1:28:42.120]  Oh, yeah, oh, I mean, every town
[1:28:42.120 --> 1:28:43.120]  In the countries being told
[1:28:43.120 --> 1:28:44.120]  Prepare to house them
[1:28:44.120 --> 1:28:46.120]  And then there's going to be a political football
[1:28:46.120 --> 1:28:48.120]  That gets kicked back and forth
[1:28:48.120 --> 1:28:52.120]  I mean, look, our fate is these people's fate, okay
[1:28:52.120 --> 1:28:54.120]  In fact, I get sick when I look at these people
[1:28:54.120 --> 1:28:56.120]  And how desperate they are
[1:28:56.120 --> 1:29:00.120]  And that we have to try to shut the border down on them
[1:29:00.120 --> 1:29:02.120]  But everything's going to go down
[1:29:02.120 --> 1:29:05.120]  In the end, when this thing falls, man
[1:29:05.120 --> 1:29:08.120]  It's going to be blood in the streets
[1:29:08.120 --> 1:29:10.120]  And people are going to line up
[1:29:10.120 --> 1:29:12.120]  And they're going to accept sterilization
[1:29:12.120 --> 1:29:13.120]  You name it for food
[1:29:13.120 --> 1:29:15.120]  It is just going to be hellish
[1:29:15.120 --> 1:29:18.120]  Absolutely hellish
[1:29:18.120 --> 1:29:20.120]  I agree with you, Alex
[1:29:20.120 --> 1:29:22.120]  I have nothing against the people
[1:29:22.120 --> 1:29:24.120]  That are in war and torn areas
[1:29:24.120 --> 1:29:26.120]  That are actual refugees
[1:29:26.120 --> 1:29:29.120]  That need a place to come to
[1:29:29.120 --> 1:29:32.120]  That we should be compassionate
[1:29:32.120 --> 1:29:35.120]  But they're being organized by the globalist
[1:29:35.120 --> 1:29:37.120]  And so they're a weapon
[1:29:37.120 --> 1:29:40.120]  And the lifeboat can't take them
[1:29:40.120 --> 1:29:42.120]  Under the welfare system
[1:29:42.120 --> 1:29:45.120]  It's designed to seek us
[1:29:45.120 --> 1:29:47.120]  That's why we're in so much trouble
[1:29:47.120 --> 1:30:01.120]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago
[1:30:01.120 --> 1:30:03.120]  Because it was helping me and my family so much
[1:30:03.120 --> 1:30:05.120]  Get healthy and detoxify
[1:30:05.120 --> 1:30:08.120]  Most people know that iodine deficiency
[1:30:08.120 --> 1:30:10.120]  Has been a crisis around the world
[1:30:10.120 --> 1:30:13.120]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions
[1:30:13.120 --> 1:30:15.120]  Especially the thyroid
[1:30:15.120 --> 1:30:18.120]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group
[1:30:18.120 --> 1:30:20.120]  You now know it as survival shield
[1:30:20.120 --> 1:30:22.120]  True nascent iodine
[1:30:22.120 --> 1:30:24.120]  That your body can really absorb
[1:30:24.120 --> 1:30:26.120]  Then about a year ago he said, listen
[1:30:26.120 --> 1:30:27.120]  If you think this is powerful
[1:30:27.120 --> 1:30:29.120]  I'm going to come out with rare earth
[1:30:29.120 --> 1:30:31.120]  Deep earth crystals
[1:30:31.120 --> 1:30:33.120]  And the results that I personally have had
[1:30:33.120 --> 1:30:35.120]  Have been life changing
[1:30:35.120 --> 1:30:37.120]  Nobody else has got iodine
[1:30:37.120 --> 1:30:39.120]  Based on these pure crystals
[1:30:39.120 --> 1:30:41.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is innovating
[1:30:41.120 --> 1:30:43.120]  And the best part is

[1:30:59.120 --> 1:31:01.120]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs
[1:31:01.120 --> 1:31:03.120]  Super male vitality was developed
[1:31:03.120 --> 1:31:07.120]  To activate your body's own natural processes

[1:31:14.120 --> 1:31:17.120]  And then concentrated for maximum potency
[1:31:17.120 --> 1:31:19.120]  I just received my male vitality

[1:31:20.120 --> 1:31:22.120]  And I must say that was good stuff
[1:31:22.120 --> 1:31:24.120]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists

[1:32:00.120 --> 1:32:02.120]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Groot
[1:32:02.120 --> 1:32:05.120]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe
[1:32:05.120 --> 1:32:09.120]  To find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available
[1:32:09.120 --> 1:32:12.120]  The new survival shield X2
[1:32:12.120 --> 1:32:16.120]  Is mined from 7 to 10,000 feet below the earth
[1:32:16.120 --> 1:32:20.120]  In pristine environmentally clean conditions

[1:32:23.120 --> 1:32:28.120]  From an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit
[1:32:28.120 --> 1:32:30.120]  Deep in the earth
[1:32:30.120 --> 1:32:34.120]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today
[1:32:34.120 --> 1:32:38.120]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop

[1:33:17.120 --> 1:33:22.120]  From the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones
[1:33:24.120 --> 1:33:30.120]  Every time that I look in the mirror
[1:33:30.120 --> 1:33:36.120]  All these lines in my face get clearer
[1:33:36.120 --> 1:33:38.120]  The past is gone
[1:33:38.120 --> 1:33:40.120]  The past is gone
[1:33:40.120 --> 1:33:42.120]  Ronnie James
[1:33:42.120 --> 1:33:46.120]  And it went by good luck
[1:33:46.120 --> 1:33:48.120]  The past is gone
[1:33:48.120 --> 1:33:51.120]  Isn't that the way
[1:33:51.120 --> 1:33:55.120]  Everybody's got their tools in life to play
[1:33:55.120 --> 1:33:58.120]  That's what aging is, it's like becoming fine wine
[1:33:58.120 --> 1:34:01.120]  Give you a fine person
[1:34:01.120 --> 1:34:04.120]  Or if you're a rotten hearted person
[1:34:04.120 --> 1:34:07.120]  You get more rotten
[1:34:07.120 --> 1:34:10.120]  I don't know if everybody's sin
[1:34:10.120 --> 1:34:15.120]  You've got to lose to learn how to wield
[1:34:15.120 --> 1:34:19.120]  That's why the nanny state doesn't want any of you
[1:34:19.120 --> 1:34:23.120]  To ever go through a process of maturing
[1:34:23.120 --> 1:34:27.120]  And to go through those rites of passage
[1:34:27.120 --> 1:34:30.120]  To be children your entire lives
[1:34:30.120 --> 1:34:33.120]  It's said that you're once the man, twice the child
[1:34:33.120 --> 1:34:36.120]  And I've certainly seen that born out in my life
[1:34:36.120 --> 1:34:41.120]  And those I've loved
[1:34:41.120 --> 1:34:45.120]  But under the New World Order you are never a man
[1:34:45.120 --> 1:34:48.120]  You are never a woman, you never mature
[1:34:48.120 --> 1:34:51.120]  You never have the rights of passage
[1:34:51.120 --> 1:34:54.120]  You're robbed of everything
[1:34:54.120 --> 1:34:57.120]  I got to get to the news, let's hurry through your calls
[1:34:57.120 --> 1:35:00.120]  Which is kind of an oxymoron for my show sometimes
[1:35:00.120 --> 1:35:03.120]  Truth Raider in Oregon, you're on the air, thanks for calling
[1:35:03.120 --> 1:35:05.120]  Alex Jones, with this jockey that plays
[1:35:05.120 --> 1:35:08.120]  Classic American patriotic hits
[1:35:08.120 --> 1:35:12.120]  Go ahead
[1:35:12.120 --> 1:35:16.120]  I have an idea for you
[1:35:16.120 --> 1:35:21.120]  Why don't you open the phones for Native Americans only
[1:35:21.120 --> 1:35:24.120]  And get their take on the North American Union
[1:35:24.120 --> 1:35:26.120]  And the merger with Mexico
[1:35:26.120 --> 1:35:29.120]  I agree with you, we should do more where we say
[1:35:29.120 --> 1:35:31.120]  We're taking calls from Obama supporters
[1:35:31.120 --> 1:35:33.120]  Or we're taking calls from Native Americans
[1:35:33.120 --> 1:35:36.120]  We're taking calls from active tea party participants
[1:35:36.120 --> 1:35:39.120]  Or we're taking calls from doctors and nurses on Obamacare
[1:35:39.120 --> 1:35:41.120]  What's it like, what's the strain
[1:35:41.120 --> 1:35:43.120]  Or we're taking calls from Border Patrol
[1:35:43.120 --> 1:35:45.120]  I know they're listening
[1:35:45.120 --> 1:35:47.120]  Or things like that
[1:35:47.120 --> 1:35:49.120]  And that's when we have our best callers
[1:35:49.120 --> 1:35:50.120]  Is when we do that
[1:35:50.120 --> 1:35:52.120]  And so I need to tell the crew
[1:35:52.120 --> 1:35:55.120]  To start pressuring me and reminding me
[1:35:55.120 --> 1:35:57.120]  Because I really produced the show overall
[1:35:57.120 --> 1:35:59.120]  To decide what's going to happen and go on
[1:35:59.120 --> 1:36:00.120]  But they feed me a lot of info
[1:36:00.120 --> 1:36:02.120]  So they're big participants
[1:36:02.120 --> 1:36:04.120]  Like we're making dinner together or something here
[1:36:04.120 --> 1:36:06.120]  It's kind of the analogy
[1:36:06.120 --> 1:36:07.120]  So it's a team effort
[1:36:07.120 --> 1:36:11.120]  But I need them to nudge me into plugging sponsors
[1:36:11.120 --> 1:36:12.120]  So we have money to operate
[1:36:12.120 --> 1:36:17.120]  And into, hey, let's do more designed shows that are better
[1:36:17.120 --> 1:36:19.120]  Because they are better when I think things out
[1:36:19.120 --> 1:36:27.120]  And try to actually order things in a better fashion
[1:36:27.120 --> 1:36:30.120]  So that's a great idea
[1:36:30.120 --> 1:36:34.120]  They are the true traditional voice of America
[1:36:34.120 --> 1:36:36.120]  Well, they're the original Homeland Security
[1:36:36.120 --> 1:36:39.120]  And again, people romanticize Native Americans
[1:36:39.120 --> 1:36:41.120]  Very diverse groups, obviously
[1:36:41.120 --> 1:36:44.120]  From the lords of the plains to the Indians
[1:36:44.120 --> 1:36:46.120]  Up in Canada and the natives
[1:36:46.120 --> 1:36:51.120]  But undoubtedly they have been through the system
[1:36:51.120 --> 1:36:53.120]  As the late Russell Means said
[1:36:53.120 --> 1:36:55.120]  Welcome to the reservation, you're all on it
[1:36:55.120 --> 1:36:58.120]  And then he discovered, which I knew
[1:36:58.120 --> 1:37:02.120]  That a large part of the Constitution and the setup
[1:37:02.120 --> 1:37:05.120]  Did come from the Iroquois Confederation
[1:37:05.120 --> 1:37:08.120]  That that is true
[1:37:08.120 --> 1:37:10.120]  And some of the Cherokee had it as well
[1:37:10.120 --> 1:37:11.120]  Similar systems
[1:37:11.120 --> 1:37:14.120]  So, I mean, we adopted a lot of it
[1:37:14.120 --> 1:37:16.120]  That is what's made America so great
[1:37:16.120 --> 1:37:18.120]  There is a richness of diversity
[1:37:18.120 --> 1:37:21.120]  Great point, thanks for the call
[1:37:21.120 --> 1:37:24.120]  I mean, Western culture is Spanish
[1:37:24.120 --> 1:37:27.120]  Mixed with frontier and mixed with black
[1:37:27.120 --> 1:37:30.120]  And Creole and Native American
[1:37:30.120 --> 1:37:33.120]  And it's a very rich culture, I like it
[1:37:33.120 --> 1:37:36.120]  The globalists don't want Hispanics
[1:37:36.120 --> 1:37:40.120]  To adopt their culture
[1:37:40.120 --> 1:37:42.120]  Of family values and private property
[1:37:42.120 --> 1:37:46.120]  And self-defense and manly men, womenly women
[1:37:46.120 --> 1:37:48.120]  No, they want them to adopt communism
[1:37:48.120 --> 1:37:49.120]  In the New World Order
[1:37:49.120 --> 1:37:51.120]  It's totally the opposite of what you would expect
[1:37:51.120 --> 1:37:53.120]  To be in the Southwestern and Mexico
[1:37:53.120 --> 1:37:56.120]  This is what they're saying, your culture is this
[1:37:56.120 --> 1:38:00.120]  Just like everybody else is told, this is your culture
[1:38:00.120 --> 1:38:02.120]  And if you look at the rest of the country
[1:38:02.120 --> 1:38:03.120]  The reason the U.S. is so interesting
[1:38:03.120 --> 1:38:06.120]  Is it does have all of those different things
[1:38:06.120 --> 1:38:07.120]  Mixed into it
[1:38:07.120 --> 1:38:09.120]  It's one reason Australia is interesting
[1:38:09.120 --> 1:38:14.120]  Is it was a prison colony
[1:38:14.120 --> 1:38:16.120]  And you got sent to prison for no reason
[1:38:16.120 --> 1:38:18.120]  Basically in England most of the time
[1:38:18.120 --> 1:38:20.120]  Or because you couldn't pay your debts
[1:38:20.120 --> 1:38:22.120]  And they took people there by the hundreds of thousands
[1:38:22.120 --> 1:38:24.120]  As slave labor
[1:38:24.120 --> 1:38:27.120]  And didn't anybody know that they wore cowboy hats
[1:38:27.120 --> 1:38:29.120]  In the whole nine yards and had cattle drives
[1:38:29.120 --> 1:38:33.120]  Open free range until the 60s when it was banned
[1:38:33.120 --> 1:38:35.120]  Like I saw online an old beer commercial from Australia
[1:38:35.120 --> 1:38:36.120]  About the last cattle drive
[1:38:36.120 --> 1:38:39.120]  I meant to, I need to find that again and play that
[1:38:39.120 --> 1:38:42.120]  But the whole point is, that's a rich culture
[1:38:42.120 --> 1:38:45.120]  Because it was from slaves
[1:38:45.120 --> 1:38:47.120]  I mean, Australia had work camps in it folks
[1:38:47.120 --> 1:38:50.120]  Where you got killed if you talk back
[1:38:50.120 --> 1:38:52.120]  And it doesn't lessen blacks' plights
[1:38:52.120 --> 1:38:55.120]  It just makes it a fraternity, a camaraderie
[1:38:55.120 --> 1:38:57.120]  Not a shameful thing that you were slaves
[1:38:57.120 --> 1:39:02.120]  Hell, all our ancestors were slaves
[1:39:02.120 --> 1:39:04.120]  They just didn't call it that
[1:39:04.120 --> 1:39:08.120]  I mean, Germany didn't outlaw indentured servitude
[1:39:08.120 --> 1:39:11.120]  Permanent slavery, neo feudalism
[1:39:11.120 --> 1:39:13.120]  What they're bringing back was feudalism
[1:39:13.120 --> 1:39:16.120]  Germany until 1888
[1:39:16.120 --> 1:39:25.120]  The last Austrian, Hungarian county or kingdom
[1:39:25.120 --> 1:39:28.120]  They had little dukes and duchesses
[1:39:28.120 --> 1:39:32.120]  And it counts over dozens of little confederations
[1:39:32.120 --> 1:39:34.120]  You've seen the neat little German shields
[1:39:34.120 --> 1:39:38.120]  One's a bear for Berlin, bear rampant I think
[1:39:38.120 --> 1:39:40.120]  And then another one's an elk or another's a boar
[1:39:40.120 --> 1:39:44.120]  I mean, that was it
[1:39:44.120 --> 1:39:49.120]  And they bred Germans to sell them for war
[1:39:49.120 --> 1:39:51.120]  And they weren't slaves with a chain around their neck
[1:39:51.120 --> 1:39:53.120]  They were so mind controlled
[1:39:53.120 --> 1:39:55.120]  And their uniforms and their Hessian boots
[1:39:55.120 --> 1:40:00.120]  They were happy to go die
[1:40:00.120 --> 1:40:02.120]  Until they got over here
[1:40:02.120 --> 1:40:05.120]  And a lot of them defected
[1:40:05.120 --> 1:40:07.120]  And they said, you mean I can have a farm
[1:40:07.120 --> 1:40:09.120]  There's Germans living here
[1:40:09.120 --> 1:40:11.120]  I can marry an English woman if I want
[1:40:11.120 --> 1:40:12.120]  I can do whatever
[1:40:12.120 --> 1:40:14.120]  I can marry a Dutch woman, I can marry an Indian woman
[1:40:14.120 --> 1:40:16.120]  I can just do whatever I want
[1:40:16.120 --> 1:40:19.120]  Yeah, come on, come on over here with us, let's go
[1:40:19.120 --> 1:40:21.120]  That's what that's all about
[1:40:21.120 --> 1:40:23.120]  They'll never make a movie about that
[1:40:23.120 --> 1:40:28.120]  Because then black people won't feel like that they're crap
[1:40:28.120 --> 1:40:33.120]  When they learn that the Germans from Prussia were slaves
[1:40:33.120 --> 1:40:37.120]  It's just all fraud, it's all lies
[1:40:37.120 --> 1:40:39.120]  It's all fake cosmologies
[1:40:39.120 --> 1:40:40.120]  They download into us
[1:40:40.120 --> 1:40:45.120]  That we then just spend our whole lives believing
[1:40:45.120 --> 1:40:49.120]  Let's go ahead and talk to Michael in FEMA Region 9
[1:40:49.120 --> 1:40:52.120]  I guess that's out there on the former Pacific Northwest
[1:40:52.120 --> 1:40:56.120]  Where are you in a former Oregon, Washington state?
[1:40:56.120 --> 1:40:58.120]  Idaho, where are you?
[1:40:58.120 --> 1:41:00.120]  Hello Alex, nice talking to you again
[1:41:00.120 --> 1:41:02.120]  Actually Arizona up in the mountains
[1:41:02.120 --> 1:41:05.120]  After my statement and your response
[1:41:05.120 --> 1:41:07.120]  I have a real quick question for you
[1:41:07.120 --> 1:41:08.120]  Go ahead
[1:41:08.120 --> 1:41:11.120]  My statement is I remember when I was a little kid
[1:41:11.120 --> 1:41:13.120]  Seeing Nixon on the TV in black and white
[1:41:13.120 --> 1:41:16.120]  Talking about Cambodia and his impeachment
[1:41:16.120 --> 1:41:17.120]  Water hitting all that
[1:41:17.120 --> 1:41:21.120]  And I was starting to become awake when I was 6, 8 years old
[1:41:21.120 --> 1:41:24.120]  And through the 70s, 80s, 90s it kept building, building, building
[1:41:24.120 --> 1:41:27.120]  I did my time in the military and whatnot
[1:41:27.120 --> 1:41:29.120]  When the wall came down in Berlin
[1:41:29.120 --> 1:41:32.120]  And what I want to say is, my point is
[1:41:32.120 --> 1:41:37.120]  I believe with the buildup of the people that are becoming awake
[1:41:37.120 --> 1:41:41.120]  Because of people like you, who I met through Jesse Ventura's
[1:41:41.120 --> 1:41:42.120]  conspiracy theories
[1:41:42.120 --> 1:41:45.120]  I saw you on his show and I said, who's this Alex Jones guy?
[1:41:45.120 --> 1:41:48.120]  So I looked you up and I've been following it ever since then
[1:41:48.120 --> 1:41:52.120]  And I believe with the acceleration
[1:41:52.120 --> 1:41:56.120]  The exponential acceleration of people becoming awake
[1:41:56.120 --> 1:42:01.120]  That the government or the New World Order has ramped things up
[1:42:01.120 --> 1:42:05.120]  As well, I believe that because they're listening to us
[1:42:05.120 --> 1:42:08.120]  And they're saying, oh wow, we've got more in our hands
[1:42:08.120 --> 1:42:11.120]  Oh listen, listen, I'm not even allowed to say
[1:42:11.120 --> 1:42:13.120]  What happened with the show
[1:42:13.120 --> 1:42:15.120]  And people say, well why don't you tell us?
[1:42:15.120 --> 1:42:17.120]  Because then no one would tell me anything
[1:42:17.120 --> 1:42:19.120]  But I'm not even allowed to say
[1:42:19.120 --> 1:42:22.120]  It wasn't just FEMA, it wasn't just Congress
[1:42:22.120 --> 1:42:24.120]  It wasn't just Homeland Security
[1:42:24.120 --> 1:42:30.120]  It wasn't just, I'm not allowed to talk about it
[1:42:30.120 --> 1:42:33.120]  It's just, this country's in deep trouble, folks
[1:42:33.120 --> 1:42:40.120]  Okay, and there's a reason Jesse doesn't do that show anymore
[1:42:40.120 --> 1:42:43.120]  And he's in this trial right now to try to get his name back
[1:42:43.120 --> 1:42:45.120]  With that Psyop they ran
[1:42:45.120 --> 1:42:48.120]  And then they weren't able to shut the Psyop down
[1:42:48.120 --> 1:42:52.120]  When Ventura exposed it, so they griefed Kyle
[1:42:52.120 --> 1:42:54.120]  Kyle was a good guy I think overall
[1:42:54.120 --> 1:42:57.120]  But he did lie about Ventura
[1:42:57.120 --> 1:42:58.120]  That's all totally made up
[1:42:58.120 --> 1:43:01.120]  So they had to get rid of him up there in Dallas
[1:43:01.120 --> 1:43:03.120]  And I mean, you don't believe that story
[1:43:03.120 --> 1:43:05.120]  That a guy with PTSD went out there
[1:43:05.120 --> 1:43:08.120]  And just shot him in a shooting range, do you?
[1:43:08.120 --> 1:43:12.120]  Anybody really believe that?
[1:43:12.120 --> 1:43:14.120]  And I'm real sad for Chris Kyle
[1:43:14.120 --> 1:43:15.120]  I'm real sad for his family
[1:43:15.120 --> 1:43:17.120]  It was like, I hope he and Anthony
[1:43:17.120 --> 1:43:18.120]  A couple days after that statement was made
[1:43:18.120 --> 1:43:20.120]  And that came out on Fox News
[1:43:20.120 --> 1:43:23.120]  I was on the show and I said, listen, Ventura's done this to everybody
[1:43:23.120 --> 1:43:27.120]  This is not a joke
[1:43:27.120 --> 1:43:30.120]  I mean
[1:43:30.120 --> 1:43:37.120]  I'm the one that called Ventura in Mexico
[1:43:37.120 --> 1:43:42.120]  He had to go into town so I could talk to him
[1:43:42.120 --> 1:43:44.120]  I mean, he's a real guy
[1:43:44.120 --> 1:43:45.120]  Totally real
[1:43:45.120 --> 1:43:47.120]  From Minnesota down to Earth
[1:43:47.120 --> 1:43:49.120]  Just wants to smoke cigars and fish all day
[1:43:49.120 --> 1:43:50.120]  And surf and stuff
[1:43:50.120 --> 1:43:55.120]  I mean, he got very upset
[1:43:55.120 --> 1:43:57.120]  Not that somebody said they beat him up
[1:43:57.120 --> 1:44:00.120]  They said he was glad Navy Seals died
[1:44:00.120 --> 1:44:03.120]  I mean, I've seen Jesse Ventura get tears in his eyes
[1:44:03.120 --> 1:44:07.120]  When he sees vets at the airport with their arms and legs blown off
[1:44:07.120 --> 1:44:10.120]  And he goes over to them and says, that's why I'm against these wars
[1:44:10.120 --> 1:44:11.120]  Look what happened to you
[1:44:11.120 --> 1:44:14.120]  I mean, these people want to take your honor away
[1:44:14.120 --> 1:44:17.120]  And all Ventura can do is sue, by the way
[1:44:17.120 --> 1:44:18.120]  And they've got an insurance policy
[1:44:18.120 --> 1:44:20.120]  And he's going to go after news score after that
[1:44:20.120 --> 1:44:25.120]  Because he can't let them go around saying he wants Navy Seals dead
[1:44:25.120 --> 1:44:30.120]  They tried to throw him out of the Navy Seals society, folks
[1:44:30.120 --> 1:44:33.120]  Because of that, why?
[1:44:33.120 --> 1:44:35.120]  And if they can get him, they can get anybody
[1:44:35.120 --> 1:44:36.120]  I didn't mean to digress
[1:44:36.120 --> 1:44:37.120]  What was your point?
[1:44:37.120 --> 1:44:38.120]  You had another question?
[1:44:38.120 --> 1:44:41.120]  Well, my point was, you know, I love your guests
[1:44:41.120 --> 1:44:43.120]  As much as I love you and all your staff
[1:44:43.120 --> 1:44:47.120]  And they're saying this is going to happen in 5, 10, 15, 20 years
[1:44:47.120 --> 1:44:49.120]  But I think it's going to be 2, 3, 4 years
[1:44:49.120 --> 1:44:54.120]  Because the New World Order is watching how fast we're progressing
[1:44:54.120 --> 1:44:55.120]  Be awake
[1:44:55.120 --> 1:44:59.120]  You put the dots on the eyes and the crosses on the teeth for me
[1:44:59.120 --> 1:45:01.120]  I've been awake since I was 6 years old
[1:45:01.120 --> 1:45:03.120]  Didn't realize what that was
[1:45:03.120 --> 1:45:05.120]  That's my point
[1:45:05.120 --> 1:45:06.120]  And I still have a question
[1:45:06.120 --> 1:45:07.120]  No, I hear you
[1:45:07.120 --> 1:45:09.120]  I think they've accelerated their timetable
[1:45:09.120 --> 1:45:12.120]  I don't think, I know, look at it
[1:45:12.120 --> 1:45:13.120]  I mean, it's there
[1:45:13.120 --> 1:45:15.120]  It's like how do you know when the stamina runners are going up the river?
[1:45:15.120 --> 1:45:18.120]  I mean, it's, how do you know when the cold front's blowing in?
[1:45:18.120 --> 1:45:19.120]  Because it's blowing in
[1:45:19.120 --> 1:45:20.120]  I mean, it's there
[1:45:20.120 --> 1:45:21.120]  It's prima facia
[1:45:21.120 --> 1:45:24.120]  Which I guess in Latin means on its face
[1:45:24.120 --> 1:45:27.120]  On its face
[1:45:27.120 --> 1:45:29.120]  Open and shut
[1:45:29.120 --> 1:45:31.120]  What's the question, brother?
[1:45:31.120 --> 1:45:32.120]  Okay, quick question
[1:45:32.120 --> 1:45:34.120]  I'm sure the millions of listeners out there
[1:45:34.120 --> 1:45:37.120]  And I love all of you brothers and sisters
[1:45:37.120 --> 1:45:38.120]  I love you New Studio
[1:45:38.120 --> 1:45:41.120]  When are you going to go full-time there?
[1:45:41.120 --> 1:45:43.120]  You know, I've had a bunch of deaths in the family
[1:45:43.120 --> 1:45:45.120]  And a bunch of other hell-breaking lists
[1:45:45.120 --> 1:45:46.120]  That I'm not going to get into later
[1:45:46.120 --> 1:45:48.120]  I'll talk about it
[1:45:48.120 --> 1:45:52.120]  And I just have not had the energy and the time
[1:45:52.120 --> 1:45:54.120]  But we're moving into there
[1:45:54.120 --> 1:45:56.120]  And I just need to just start making decisions
[1:45:56.120 --> 1:45:58.120]  About where to put it on television, what to do
[1:45:58.120 --> 1:45:59.120]  It's mainly me
[1:45:59.120 --> 1:46:02.120]  I've been holding things up
[1:46:02.120 --> 1:46:06.120]  Because, I mean, I won't even spend time to cut new ads
[1:46:06.120 --> 1:46:07.120]  To try to make money
[1:46:07.120 --> 1:46:09.120]  You know, it's just
[1:46:09.120 --> 1:46:13.120]  Because I'm so
[1:46:13.120 --> 1:46:14.120]  Not even during the headlights now
[1:46:14.120 --> 1:46:17.120]  It's just, I have a bigger understanding of things now
[1:46:17.120 --> 1:46:19.120]  And things are so complex
[1:46:19.120 --> 1:46:20.120]  But also so simple
[1:46:20.120 --> 1:46:22.120]  That it's like I almost can't even talk sometimes now
[1:46:22.120 --> 1:46:25.120]  Because it's just like
[1:46:25.120 --> 1:46:26.120]  Again, I liken it to
[1:46:26.120 --> 1:46:28.120]  You're doing work at your neighbor's house
[1:46:28.120 --> 1:46:30.120]  And a panel comes back and there's dead kids
[1:46:30.120 --> 1:46:32.120]  And, you know, barrels
[1:46:32.120 --> 1:46:34.120]  I mean, those are true stories that have happened to people
[1:46:34.120 --> 1:46:36.120]  And you just fall down
[1:46:36.120 --> 1:46:37.120]  I mean, you're just like
[1:46:37.120 --> 1:46:41.120]  And then the crime is committed
[1:46:41.120 --> 1:46:42.120]  And no one gets in trouble
[1:46:42.120 --> 1:46:45.120]  I mean, it's that next level
[1:46:45.120 --> 1:46:47.120]  Of opening Jeffrey Dahmer's refrigerator
[1:46:47.120 --> 1:46:48.120]  And there's dead people
[1:46:48.120 --> 1:46:50.120]  And he didn't get in trouble
[1:46:50.120 --> 1:46:51.120]  Well, he did get in trouble
[1:46:51.120 --> 1:46:53.120]  And then he got beat to death in prison
[1:46:53.120 --> 1:46:58.120]  Justice came to him
[1:46:58.120 --> 1:47:01.120]  But the globalists don't get in trouble
[1:47:01.120 --> 1:47:04.120]  They just sit there
[1:47:04.120 --> 1:47:07.120]  I mean, hundreds of people by name
[1:47:07.120 --> 1:47:09.120]  Have been written about in the Wall Street Journal
[1:47:09.120 --> 1:47:13.120]  Who were begging not to be killed in hospitals
[1:47:13.120 --> 1:47:17.120]  I mean, they had death panels 20 years ago
[1:47:17.120 --> 1:47:19.120]  And I've got to sit here and debate
[1:47:19.120 --> 1:47:20.120]  Whether there were death panels
[1:47:20.120 --> 1:47:24.120]  In the legislation
[1:47:31.120 --> 1:47:33.120]  I mean, at a certain point
[1:47:33.120 --> 1:47:36.120]  Do we just sit here and talk about this?
[1:47:36.120 --> 1:47:38.120]  And they're like, no, start a civil war
[1:47:38.120 --> 1:47:39.120]  That's what they want
[1:47:39.120 --> 1:47:41.120]  Well, no, we don't want to do that
[1:47:41.120 --> 1:47:42.120]  And it's just like a joke
[1:47:42.120 --> 1:47:45.120]  It's like a joke when I pull up to some checkpoint
[1:47:45.120 --> 1:47:47.120]  Downtown and they want to search me
[1:47:47.120 --> 1:47:48.120]  I'm just like, it's ridiculous
[1:47:48.120 --> 1:47:50.120]  The border is wide open
[1:47:50.120 --> 1:47:53.120]  What you're doing is illegal
[1:47:53.120 --> 1:47:56.120]  Don't shoot your kids up with the vaccines, cops
[1:47:56.120 --> 1:47:58.120]  I'll be on the elevator in a hotel somewhere
[1:47:58.120 --> 1:47:59.120]  I'll just tell people that have kids
[1:47:59.120 --> 1:48:00.120]  Or I'll see a pregnant woman
[1:48:00.120 --> 1:48:01.120]  I'll go, listen, I'm tired
[1:48:01.120 --> 1:48:02.120]  Don't want to get in your business
[1:48:02.120 --> 1:48:03.120]  But I got to tell you
[1:48:03.120 --> 1:48:05.120]  You better look into vaccines
[1:48:05.120 --> 1:48:08.120]  You better look into iodine deficiency and deformities
[1:48:08.120 --> 1:48:10.120]  A lot of people say, no, thank you
[1:48:10.120 --> 1:48:11.120]  Thank you for caring
[1:48:11.120 --> 1:48:13.120]  I just...
[1:48:13.120 --> 1:48:15.120]  Oh, man
[1:48:15.120 --> 1:48:19.120]  I'm sorry I'm ranting here
[1:48:19.120 --> 1:48:20.120]  I'm not even really ranting
[1:48:20.120 --> 1:48:24.120]  I'm mainly polaxed is the word
[1:48:24.120 --> 1:48:26.120]  I'm stunned
[1:48:26.120 --> 1:48:29.120]  They say John on the island of Patmos
[1:48:29.120 --> 1:48:33.120]  Marveled at the beast system
[1:48:33.120 --> 1:48:34.120]  And that's really it
[1:48:34.120 --> 1:48:36.120]  I mean, it's like what?
[1:48:36.120 --> 1:48:37.120]  It's really that bad?
[1:48:37.120 --> 1:48:38.120]  And it is
[1:48:38.120 --> 1:48:40.120]  And it's so much more evil
[1:48:40.120 --> 1:48:41.120]  Than I can even grasp
[1:48:41.120 --> 1:48:44.120]  And I've got one of probably the biggest grasp on this
[1:48:44.120 --> 1:48:45.120]  Of anybody
[1:48:45.120 --> 1:48:46.120]  And let me tell you
[1:48:46.120 --> 1:48:47.120]  It ain't fun, folks
[1:48:47.120 --> 1:48:49.120]  Seeing all the propaganda
[1:48:49.120 --> 1:48:50.120]  Understanding it to a deep level
[1:48:50.120 --> 1:48:53.120]  Where just everything is like hammering me with data
[1:48:53.120 --> 1:48:57.120]  Hammering me with 10, 20 levels into something
[1:48:57.120 --> 1:49:01.120]  And then no way with verbal repertoire
[1:49:01.120 --> 1:49:05.120]  With a lexicon to be able to describe it
[1:49:05.120 --> 1:49:11.120]  One cannot be told about the matrix
[1:49:11.120 --> 1:49:13.120]  You got to see it
[1:49:13.120 --> 1:49:14.120]  You got to take the red pill
[1:49:14.120 --> 1:49:17.120]  You got to decide you want to know reality
[1:49:17.120 --> 1:49:19.120]  I think that's what it comes down to, folks
[1:49:19.120 --> 1:49:21.120]  It's so obvious now
[1:49:21.120 --> 1:49:23.120]  And so evil now
[1:49:23.120 --> 1:49:27.120]  And so metastasizing now, galloping
[1:49:27.120 --> 1:49:31.120]  Raging evil, a spirit
[1:49:31.120 --> 1:49:36.120]  That is very hard to resist
[1:49:36.120 --> 1:49:37.120]  I think that's it
[1:49:37.120 --> 1:49:39.120]  Is that this spirit
[1:49:39.120 --> 1:49:40.120]  Even if you don't believe in spirits
[1:49:40.120 --> 1:49:41.120]  You know, like in a pep rally
[1:49:41.120 --> 1:49:43.120]  You feel the spirit, you feel the energy
[1:49:43.120 --> 1:49:47.120]  This energy is so strong, ladies and gentlemen
[1:49:47.120 --> 1:49:52.120]  That it's hard for me to resist it
[1:49:52.120 --> 1:49:53.120]  You understand?
[1:49:53.120 --> 1:49:55.120]  It's that strong
[1:49:55.120 --> 1:49:58.120]  And it's getting stronger
[1:49:58.120 --> 1:50:01.120]  These are the times that try men's souls
[1:50:01.120 --> 1:50:03.120]  These are they
[1:50:03.120 --> 1:50:06.120]  The ultimate weapon with the decadence
[1:50:06.120 --> 1:50:08.120]  And the entertainment, all is a shield
[1:50:08.120 --> 1:50:10.120]  All is a cloak
[1:50:10.120 --> 1:50:13.120]  For the real operation going on
[1:50:13.120 --> 1:50:15.120]  So you don't get scared
[1:50:15.120 --> 1:50:17.120]  You don't think anything's going on
[1:50:17.120 --> 1:50:18.120]  People need to be upset
[1:50:18.120 --> 1:50:20.120]  People need to be freaking out
[1:50:20.120 --> 1:50:22.120]  People need to be hitting their knees
[1:50:22.120 --> 1:50:24.120]  And asking God for guidance and repenting
[1:50:24.120 --> 1:50:26.120]  But you can't go to these churches
[1:50:26.120 --> 1:50:30.120]  They're government run FBI, CIA agents
[1:50:30.120 --> 1:50:32.120]  Almost every church, it's on record
[1:50:32.120 --> 1:50:35.120]  Hordes of response teams bringing in the illegals
[1:50:35.120 --> 1:50:37.120]  Telling wives to divorce their husbands
[1:50:37.120 --> 1:50:40.120]  Saying Jesus isn't the Messiah
[1:50:40.120 --> 1:50:43.120]  And people say, how dare you talk about about Hagee
[1:50:43.120 --> 1:50:45.120]  That's how controlled people are
[1:50:45.120 --> 1:50:50.120]  I mean, it is just like hard core
[1:50:50.120 --> 1:50:54.120]  It's a great delusion
[1:50:54.120 --> 1:50:56.120]  All right, I'm going to wipe out this segment
[1:50:56.120 --> 1:50:58.120]  And come back with Dave and others
[1:50:58.120 --> 1:51:24.120]  This hour brought to you by InfidelBodyArmor.com

[1:54:39.120 --> 1:54:43.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, I almost didn't make it back on air into this channel
[1:54:43.120 --> 1:54:48.120]  Because John Bown and Don Salazar and I were literally running around
[1:54:48.120 --> 1:54:50.120]  Yelling in the halls
[1:54:50.120 --> 1:54:52.120]  And I'm not gonna break this now
[1:54:52.120 --> 1:54:54.120]  I'm gonna have Watson or one of them do a story
[1:54:54.120 --> 1:54:56.120]  But they're about to leave and go down there
[1:54:56.120 --> 1:55:03.120]  What we just discovered is so sensational
[1:55:03.120 --> 1:55:12.120]  I mean, it just gets crazier by the minute
[1:55:12.120 --> 1:55:15.120]  If I say it now, it won't be big
[1:55:15.120 --> 1:55:17.120]  So I want an article about this
[1:55:17.120 --> 1:55:19.120]  Obviously the guys are going down there
[1:55:19.120 --> 1:55:23.120]  But we gotta have an article separately about this
[1:55:23.120 --> 1:55:28.120]  This is incredible
[1:55:28.120 --> 1:55:29.120]  See, I'm torn
[1:55:29.120 --> 1:55:31.120]  I want to be in there planning this
[1:55:31.120 --> 1:55:33.120]  Instead, I'm in here on the air
[1:55:33.120 --> 1:55:38.120]  And I want to tell everybody
[1:55:38.120 --> 1:55:42.120]  I mean, this country is so screwed up, man
[1:55:42.120 --> 1:55:44.120]  I mean, it makes you laugh
[1:55:44.120 --> 1:55:46.120]  It's so ridiculous
[1:55:46.120 --> 1:55:48.120]  It's so over the top
[1:55:48.120 --> 1:55:55.120]  Oh
[1:55:55.120 --> 1:55:57.120]  Mmm
[1:55:57.120 --> 1:55:59.120]  Let's go to Dave in Pennsylvania
[1:55:59.120 --> 1:56:00.120]  Thanks for holding
[1:56:00.120 --> 1:56:01.120]  Go ahead
[1:56:01.120 --> 1:56:03.120]  Yes, Alex, I have a suggestion
[1:56:03.120 --> 1:56:05.120]  I was wondering if it would be at all possible
[1:56:05.120 --> 1:56:08.120]  If you could please bring back the Obama phone lady
[1:56:08.120 --> 1:56:10.120]  To hear her comment about the latest strategy
[1:56:10.120 --> 1:56:11.120]  I said that
[1:56:11.120 --> 1:56:12.120]  I said it months ago
[1:56:12.120 --> 1:56:14.120]  Guys, call the Obama phone lady
[1:56:14.120 --> 1:56:15.120]  I don't have the crew to get all this done
[1:56:15.120 --> 1:56:17.120]  We need to get her flown back up here
[1:56:17.120 --> 1:56:18.120]  Pay her to come up here
[1:56:18.120 --> 1:56:19.120]  Lovely lady
[1:56:19.120 --> 1:56:21.120]  And bring her up here next week
[1:56:21.120 --> 1:56:23.120]  Because I never got the Obama deception out
[1:56:23.120 --> 1:56:24.120]  There's this incredible interview with her
[1:56:24.120 --> 1:56:26.120]  I should probably just release that by itself
[1:56:26.120 --> 1:56:28.120]  The new Obama deception
[1:56:28.120 --> 1:56:29.120]  I should just release what I have
[1:56:29.120 --> 1:56:30.120]  It's better than nothing
[1:56:30.120 --> 1:56:32.120]  And it's incredible
[1:56:32.120 --> 1:56:35.120]  She was already turning against Obama
[1:56:35.120 --> 1:56:37.120]  Six months ago
[1:56:37.120 --> 1:56:38.120]  A year ago
[1:56:38.120 --> 1:56:40.120]  So imagine now how a wicks shall be
[1:56:40.120 --> 1:56:42.120]  Genius idea, sir
[1:56:42.120 --> 1:56:44.120]  Yeah, because I remember last year even that
[1:56:44.120 --> 1:56:46.120]  You were planning on releasing that documentary
[1:56:46.120 --> 1:56:47.120]  The end of last year
[1:56:47.120 --> 1:56:50.120]  Yeah, and so now I can't basically release the film
[1:56:50.120 --> 1:56:52.120]  Because I got to make a whole new one
[1:56:52.120 --> 1:56:54.120]  Which is probably what needs to be done
[1:56:54.120 --> 1:56:56.120]  I need to get into brainstorm mode
[1:56:56.120 --> 1:56:58.120]  Lock myself here for two weeks
[1:56:58.120 --> 1:57:00.120]  I made Obama deception
[1:57:00.120 --> 1:57:02.120]  That's been seen 50, 60, 70 million
[1:57:02.120 --> 1:57:03.120]  I mean, no exaggeration
[1:57:03.120 --> 1:57:05.120]  Probably 70 million times
[1:57:05.120 --> 1:57:07.120]  And produced loose change
[1:57:07.120 --> 1:57:08.120]  It got seen over 100 million
[1:57:08.120 --> 1:57:09.120]  But the point is
[1:57:09.120 --> 1:57:11.120]  Is that
[1:57:11.120 --> 1:57:15.120]  Not bragging, just shows the power of the people
[1:57:15.120 --> 1:57:17.120]  Absolutely
[1:57:17.120 --> 1:57:20.120]  I need to just lock myself in with all the stuff we've got
[1:57:20.120 --> 1:57:22.120]  Reshoot my part
[1:57:22.120 --> 1:57:25.120]  And just put the stinkin' film out
[1:57:25.120 --> 1:57:27.120]  I mean, I've never started stuff and not finished it
[1:57:27.120 --> 1:57:30.120]  It's just I've bitten off so much more than I can chew
[1:57:30.120 --> 1:57:32.120]  And things have been going on
[1:57:32.120 --> 1:57:34.120]  That I just haven't gotten a lot of projects done
[1:57:34.120 --> 1:57:37.120]  That kind of piled up
[1:57:37.120 --> 1:57:39.120]  Really hit upon a good point about people
[1:57:39.120 --> 1:57:40.120]  Waking up out here
[1:57:40.120 --> 1:57:42.120]  Because back on Memorial Day
[1:57:42.120 --> 1:57:44.120]  I was at my sister's house for Memorial Day party
[1:57:44.120 --> 1:57:46.120]  And her daughter, my niece, has a boyfriend
[1:57:46.120 --> 1:57:49.120]  He's like in his early 20s and asked me the question
[1:57:49.120 --> 1:57:53.120]  How much longer do you think they can continue the illusion?
[1:57:56.120 --> 1:57:59.120]  Absolutely, what else is on your mind, sir?
[1:57:59.120 --> 1:58:01.120]  I mean, that to myself was incredible
[1:58:01.120 --> 1:58:03.120]  To hear that come out of the mouth of a young person
[1:58:03.120 --> 1:58:05.120]  Like that, you know?
[1:58:07.120 --> 1:58:09.120]  Do you think the awakening is explosive
[1:58:09.120 --> 1:58:11.120]  Or just systematic?
[1:58:11.120 --> 1:58:13.120]  I think it's explosive across the board
[1:58:13.120 --> 1:58:16.120]  Because people out here are not as dumb or as stupid
[1:58:16.120 --> 1:58:19.120]  As the New World Order would expect us to be
[1:58:20.120 --> 1:58:23.120]  Well, people are either awake or they're getting dumber
[1:58:23.120 --> 1:58:27.120]  I mean, you see a separation from the wheat from the chaff
[1:58:27.120 --> 1:58:30.120]  Interesting points, thank you so much
[1:58:30.120 --> 1:58:33.120]  I'm even having trouble continuing the broadcast right now
[1:58:33.120 --> 1:58:35.120]  After what I just learned
[1:58:35.120 --> 1:58:37.120]  It's just there's no end to it
[1:58:37.120 --> 1:58:39.120]  We'll be back with a third hour
[1:58:39.120 --> 1:58:42.120]  We'll go to Tony and Carlos
[1:58:42.120 --> 1:58:43.120]  And Patrick
[1:58:43.120 --> 1:58:45.120]  Please remember to financially support us
[1:58:45.120 --> 1:58:47.120]  Great products, shop with the good guys
[1:58:47.120 --> 1:58:49.120]  And go to our store.com
[1:58:49.120 --> 1:58:51.120]  I can like taste dirt in it
[1:58:51.120 --> 1:58:52.120]  God knows what's in there
[1:58:52.120 --> 1:58:55.120]  These people just sampled City of Austin tap water
[1:58:55.120 --> 1:58:56.120]  Straight from the faucet
[1:58:56.120 --> 1:58:59.120]  Next, we had them try a sample of tap water
[1:58:59.120 --> 1:59:02.120]  Filtered through the Pro Pure G2.0 filtration system
[1:59:02.120 --> 1:59:03.120]  That one is better
[1:59:03.120 --> 1:59:04.120]  Tastes like nothing
[1:59:04.120 --> 1:59:06.120]  Yep, I know what good water tastes like
[1:59:06.120 --> 1:59:07.120]  It's good water
[1:59:07.120 --> 1:59:09.120]  Most tap water contains added substances
[1:59:09.120 --> 1:59:12.120]  Like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate, and many others
[1:59:12.120 --> 1:59:14.120]  Studies prove that these substances
[1:59:14.120 --> 1:59:17.120]  Are linked to an assortment of major health issues
[1:59:17.120 --> 1:59:20.120]  Including tooth decay, lower IQ, and even cancer
[1:59:20.120 --> 1:59:21.120]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake
[1:59:21.120 --> 1:59:23.120]  When you're drinking tap water
[1:59:23.120 --> 1:59:26.120]  The Pro Pure G2.0 filtration system
[1:59:26.120 --> 1:59:28.120]  Removes these deadly substances
[1:59:28.120 --> 1:59:31.120]  Leaving only fresh tasting, deliciously clean water
[1:59:31.120 --> 1:59:32.120]  Okay, this is very tasty
[1:59:32.120 --> 1:59:33.120]  It's good water
[1:59:33.120 --> 1:59:34.120]  Refreshing
[1:59:34.120 --> 1:59:35.120]  It's good

[2:00:11.120 --> 2:00:13.120]  Well, so does he

[2:00:20.120 --> 2:00:46.120]  Alex Jones
[2:00:46.120 --> 2:00:49.120]  Hi, we're paramilitary federal police
[2:00:49.120 --> 2:00:52.120]  And we'd like you to tell us if anything suspicious is going on
[2:00:52.120 --> 2:00:54.120]  Yeah, we have a criminal government
[2:00:54.120 --> 2:00:57.120]  That's opened the borders up
[2:00:57.120 --> 2:00:58.120]  Light open
[2:00:58.120 --> 2:01:02.120]  In fact, I want to shoot a special report for the nightly news tonight
[2:01:02.120 --> 2:01:06.120]  On this, and I'm going to do a tongue-in-cheek piece on
[2:01:06.120 --> 2:01:09.120]  Well, I'm going to call Homeland Security up
[2:01:09.120 --> 2:01:13.120]  And for real, and report them
[2:01:13.120 --> 2:01:16.120]  So when I say it's a spoo for a stunt, it's not really
[2:01:16.120 --> 2:01:20.120]  I'm going to say, yeah, I'm here to report that the feds are aiding in a bed
[2:01:20.120 --> 2:01:22.120]  And completing the smuggling process
[2:01:22.120 --> 2:01:24.120]  Oh, man, I tell you, what a joke
[2:01:27.120 --> 2:01:29.120]  Cop pulls me over, mind if I search your car?
[2:01:29.120 --> 2:01:31.120]  Or do you have anything to hide?
[2:01:31.120 --> 2:01:35.120]  I'll go, yeah, I live in an authoritarian country
[2:01:35.120 --> 2:01:39.120]  Where they arrest women whose 9-year-old daughters play across the street at the park
[2:01:39.120 --> 2:01:41.120]  And then take the girl away from them
[2:01:41.120 --> 2:01:44.120]  Yeah, I'm really worried about you
[2:01:44.120 --> 2:01:48.120]  Not that you're probably a bad person, but, man, you work for some really dangerous people
[2:01:48.120 --> 2:01:50.120]  I'm scared of you
[2:01:50.120 --> 2:01:52.120]  And maybe you like that, but
[2:01:52.120 --> 2:01:54.120]  You think that's a safe country?
[2:01:54.120 --> 2:01:57.120]  Tony in Ohio, you're on the air, go ahead
[2:01:58.120 --> 2:02:02.120]  Hi, Alex, this is Tony, I'm in Idaho
[2:02:02.120 --> 2:02:03.120]  Idaho, I'm sorry
[2:02:03.120 --> 2:02:08.120]  Anyway, yeah, I wanted to talk about the way these government preachers
[2:02:08.120 --> 2:02:12.120]  And these government churches are getting the very people to stand down
[2:02:12.120 --> 2:02:14.120]  Who have the power to stop this
[2:02:14.120 --> 2:02:18.120]  It's by the false teaching that Jesus didn't come
[2:02:18.120 --> 2:02:21.120]  When he prophesied that he would come in the first century
[2:02:21.120 --> 2:02:27.120]  He said to those people, he says, really, I say unto you, this generation shall not pass
[2:02:27.120 --> 2:02:29.120]  To all these things people filled
[2:02:29.120 --> 2:02:33.120]  And then people say it was Titus sacking Rome in 70 AD
[2:02:33.120 --> 2:02:36.120]  I don't know if I agree with that interpretation
[2:02:36.120 --> 2:02:38.120]  There have been many antichrists
[2:02:38.120 --> 2:02:40.120]  There are smaller versions of the bigger version
[2:02:40.120 --> 2:02:42.120]  Things repeat themselves in cycles
[2:02:42.120 --> 2:02:44.120]  So I think it's more sophisticated than that
[2:02:44.120 --> 2:02:46.120]  But I don't want to get into an argument with you about that
[2:02:46.120 --> 2:02:50.120]  I know this, you go to mega churches
[2:02:50.120 --> 2:02:55.120]  And those people are eyeing you as operatives
[2:02:55.120 --> 2:02:57.120]  And this is on record, it's not my opinion
[2:02:57.120 --> 2:02:59.120]  And they're there to suppress and control
[2:02:59.120 --> 2:03:00.120]  They're social engineers
[2:03:00.120 --> 2:03:02.120]  And that's now mainstream news
[2:03:02.120 --> 2:03:04.120]  But the flocks don't know it
[2:03:04.120 --> 2:03:08.120]  I've got a buddy out by the lake that has a preacher I've had dinner with
[2:03:08.120 --> 2:03:10.120]  He's a listener who totally gets it
[2:03:10.120 --> 2:03:14.120]  And is on fire and knows what he's talking about
[2:03:14.120 --> 2:03:17.120]  And I ought to go to that church
[2:03:17.120 --> 2:03:21.120]  It's just like 45 minutes from where I live
[2:03:21.120 --> 2:03:23.120]  Or an hour if there's traffic
[2:03:23.120 --> 2:03:25.120]  But I'm going to start taking my children there
[2:03:25.120 --> 2:03:26.120]  Because that guy's on fire
[2:03:26.120 --> 2:03:28.120]  And that's a great blessing
[2:03:28.120 --> 2:03:31.120]  Because I haven't found many good preachers around here
[2:03:31.120 --> 2:03:34.120]  I'll go to funerals for people that die
[2:03:34.120 --> 2:03:37.120]  And the preacher will come over and try to mess with me
[2:03:37.120 --> 2:03:39.120]  Telling me I'm full of baloney and everything
[2:03:39.120 --> 2:03:42.120]  I'm just like, come on, man, come on
[2:03:42.120 --> 2:03:44.120]  Anyway, sorry, go ahead
[2:03:44.120 --> 2:03:47.120]  I understand what you're saying
[2:03:47.120 --> 2:03:50.120]  Alec, let me just make two quick point please
[2:03:50.120 --> 2:03:55.120]  Christ said to the people that he was standing around listening
[2:03:55.120 --> 2:03:59.120]  I'm sorry, he's tied a sect Jerusalem in 70 AD
[2:03:59.120 --> 2:04:01.120]  Rome was sacked in 410 by Alaric
[2:04:01.120 --> 2:04:04.120]  Again, I'm tired, I scramble things
[2:04:04.120 --> 2:04:05.120]  Go ahead, sir
[2:04:05.120 --> 2:04:09.120]  Anyway, he said to the people that were standing around listening to him teach
[2:04:09.120 --> 2:04:11.120]  He said, very, I stand to you
[2:04:11.120 --> 2:04:13.120]  There be some of them that stand here
[2:04:13.120 --> 2:04:15.120]  That shall not taste of death
[2:04:15.120 --> 2:04:18.120]  So they see the Son of Man come in his kingdom with power
[2:04:18.120 --> 2:04:20.120]  Those people are dead
[2:04:20.120 --> 2:04:22.120]  They're not standing around waiting for him to die
[2:04:22.120 --> 2:04:26.120]  Well, they're saying that's the generation when Israel is reestablished
[2:04:26.120 --> 2:04:28.120]  Is the interpretation that debates that
[2:04:28.120 --> 2:04:32.120]  That that generation will not die from 1947
[2:04:32.120 --> 2:04:37.120]  Or 1949 depending on how you look at it before the return of Christ
[2:04:37.120 --> 2:04:39.120]  He said to Caiaphas
[2:04:39.120 --> 2:04:43.120]  Now this is Caiaphas, a high priest of that generation
[2:04:43.120 --> 2:04:49.120]  Listen, I don't debate that rapture theology is used to make everybody celebrate the takeover of evil
[2:04:49.120 --> 2:04:52.120]  As Christians sit on their giant butts doing nothing
[2:04:52.120 --> 2:04:55.120]  Serving Satan at the right hand
[2:04:55.120 --> 2:05:02.120]  The churches are the army of Satan

[2:08:19.120 --> 2:08:35.120]  Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones
[2:08:35.120 --> 2:08:36.120]  Alright, we're going right to our guest
[2:08:36.120 --> 2:08:40.120]  Then your phone calls, then the niche of Martin Luther King
[2:08:40.120 --> 2:08:42.120]  That's a new book out
[2:08:42.120 --> 2:08:45.120]  You only know what Martin Luther King really stood for
[2:08:45.120 --> 2:08:48.120]  It's called King Ghouls
[2:08:48.120 --> 2:08:51.120]  But this story is very important up on infowars.com
[2:08:51.120 --> 2:08:54.120]  Controlling the narrative, a woman calls Cheney War Criminal
[2:08:54.120 --> 2:08:56.120]  C-Span cuts the feed
[2:08:56.120 --> 2:08:58.120]  And I mentioned this earlier
[2:08:58.120 --> 2:09:01.120]  But I want to play a clip of this
[2:09:01.120 --> 2:09:04.120]  People ask, well then if they cut the feed, how did that happen?
[2:09:04.120 --> 2:09:06.120]  People shot it then on a phone
[2:09:06.120 --> 2:09:09.120]  But the feed got cut, they admit they cut the feed
[2:09:09.120 --> 2:09:11.120]  And under that we have a video report
[2:09:11.120 --> 2:09:17.120]  Obama has been given kill switch to the entire media system
[2:09:17.120 --> 2:09:24.120]  That is not just a kill switch for the internet
[2:09:24.120 --> 2:09:26.120]  It's the kill switch for your phones, you name it
[2:09:26.120 --> 2:09:31.120]  But the headline is Obama has been given the kill switch to the entire communication system
[2:09:31.120 --> 2:09:34.120]  And that is absolutely on target and absolutely right
[2:09:34.120 --> 2:09:36.120]  And it's very, very important
[2:09:36.120 --> 2:09:39.120]  But here is a short clip
[2:09:39.120 --> 2:09:41.120]  This is the beginning of the end of the new media
[2:09:41.120 --> 2:09:45.120]  If they're able to do this, Chinese style net censorship, you name it
[2:09:45.120 --> 2:09:47.120]  And it's incredible that C-Span did this
[2:09:47.120 --> 2:09:50.120]  Here's the woman calling Dick Cheney a war criminal
[2:09:50.120 --> 2:09:52.120]  That C-Span doesn't want you to see
[2:09:52.120 --> 2:09:58.120]  I was chatting with the vice president back stage
[2:09:58.120 --> 2:10:01.120]  And I was saying, I thought that never gets old
[2:10:01.120 --> 2:10:04.120]  And he said, he's mean
[2:10:09.120 --> 2:10:11.120]  And they cut the feed
[2:10:11.120 --> 2:10:16.120]  How do you like that?
[2:10:16.120 --> 2:10:18.120]  They cut the outside of the capital
[2:10:18.120 --> 2:10:20.120]  Why don't they want that?
[2:10:20.120 --> 2:10:23.120]  It's a bigger deal than people know
[2:10:23.120 --> 2:10:25.120]  The globalist, I guarantee you don't like it
[2:10:25.120 --> 2:10:27.120]  Brian Lamb, I'm not saying he's a bad guy
[2:10:27.120 --> 2:10:31.120]  Years ago, talked about in an interview
[2:10:31.120 --> 2:10:36.120]  How horrible it was that my listeners were dominating C-Span calling in constantly
[2:10:36.120 --> 2:10:39.120]  And he also talked about in another interview about
[2:10:39.120 --> 2:10:41.120]  My radio show and how scary it is
[2:10:41.120 --> 2:10:44.120]  And I can tell Brian Lamb has nice, compassionate eyes
[2:10:44.120 --> 2:10:45.120]  Seems very intelligent
[2:10:45.120 --> 2:10:47.120]  I've watched it in the journal back when he used to host it
[2:10:47.120 --> 2:10:49.120]  I like his work
[2:10:49.120 --> 2:10:52.120]  You can tell Brian Lamb was freaked out
[2:10:52.120 --> 2:10:54.120]  Ten years ago when he was talking about me
[2:10:54.120 --> 2:10:57.120]  He doesn't talk about me now
[2:10:57.120 --> 2:11:00.120]  Because you hear this stuff, it should freak you out
[2:11:00.120 --> 2:11:04.120]  Because if I'm right, well, that means we're in a lot of trouble, doesn't it?
[2:11:04.120 --> 2:11:06.120]  Well, of course I'm right
[2:11:06.120 --> 2:11:09.120]  I mean, they're teaching 2 plus 2 equals 5 in the schools, folks
[2:11:09.120 --> 2:11:12.120]  You don't have to believe me, I'm not the one that's right
[2:11:12.120 --> 2:11:14.120]  It's prima facie
[2:11:14.120 --> 2:11:18.120]  It's on the face
[2:11:18.120 --> 2:11:20.120]  It's like saying red wine's red, folks
[2:11:20.120 --> 2:11:22.120]  It's just, it is
[2:11:22.120 --> 2:11:25.120]  It's like saying, Mike Tyson's a boxer, it is
[2:11:25.120 --> 2:11:29.120]  George Washington's a general, it is
[2:11:29.120 --> 2:11:31.120]  Ducks are birds, it is
[2:11:31.120 --> 2:11:33.120]  It is a tyranny, it is oppressive
[2:11:33.120 --> 2:11:36.120]  It is totalitarian, total
[2:11:36.120 --> 2:11:39.120]  That's William Benny, number 4 at the National Security Agency
[2:11:39.120 --> 2:11:43.120]  There is an authoritarian population control system going on
[2:11:46.120 --> 2:11:50.120]  And if people dominate live events
[2:11:50.120 --> 2:11:53.120]  I mean, if you go in with Hillary Clinton's at a book signing
[2:11:53.120 --> 2:11:56.120]  And confront her, even nicely, it'll freak her out
[2:11:56.120 --> 2:11:58.120]  It happens everywhere, she'll break down
[2:11:58.120 --> 2:12:01.120]  These narcissist control freak demons are scared of us
[2:12:01.120 --> 2:12:05.120]  We need to put pressure on them so they know that we're not scared of their intimidation
[2:12:05.120 --> 2:12:09.120]  And it's making us come out of the woodwork peacefully against them
[2:12:09.120 --> 2:12:12.120]  You need to do everything, I mean, you know, go bullhorn outside their houses
[2:12:12.120 --> 2:12:15.120]  I mean, they're funding Al Qaeda to kill Christians all over the world
[2:12:15.120 --> 2:12:17.120]  Go get in the State Department people's faces
[2:12:17.120 --> 2:12:19.120]  Get in their faces
[2:12:19.120 --> 2:12:21.120]  You're a citizen, they're raping our name
[2:12:21.120 --> 2:12:23.120]  They're funding evil
[2:12:23.120 --> 2:12:28.120]  Breitbart, breaking, top of drudge
[2:12:28.120 --> 2:12:33.120]  Released, alien from border crisis, arrested for alleged murder
[2:12:33.120 --> 2:12:35.120]  Kidnapping in Texas
[2:12:35.120 --> 2:12:37.120]  See, there's AP
[2:12:37.120 --> 2:12:40.120]  More kidnappings in South Carolina by illegals
[2:12:40.120 --> 2:12:42.120]  AP
[2:12:42.120 --> 2:12:46.120]  Welcome to my nightmare
[2:12:46.120 --> 2:12:49.120]  I think you're gonna like it
[2:12:49.120 --> 2:12:53.120]  Okay, let's go ahead and go to our guest, Abby Johnson
[2:12:53.120 --> 2:12:56.120]  Couldn't get on the show last week, his traffic was shut down so bad
[2:12:56.120 --> 2:12:58.120]  She's on the phone with us today
[2:12:58.120 --> 2:13:02.120]  She has ATTWN.org
[2:13:02.120 --> 2:13:06.120]  And she left the abortion industry in 2009
[2:13:06.120 --> 2:13:10.120]  She's known that her calling was to work with current and former abortion clinic workers
[2:13:10.120 --> 2:13:12.120]  She knows the deception the abortion industry too well
[2:13:12.120 --> 2:13:15.120]  Working with Planned Parenthoods in 2001
[2:13:15.120 --> 2:13:19.120]  And I'm gonna get her on for a full hour sometime in studio, I'm begging her to do that
[2:13:19.120 --> 2:13:21.120]  To the position of health care director
[2:13:21.120 --> 2:13:24.120]  And last year for employment many things began to disturb her
[2:13:24.120 --> 2:13:28.120]  And why not just actually hear from her
[2:13:28.120 --> 2:13:31.120]  Everybody needs to go to her website, I want to tweet it out right now
[2:13:31.120 --> 2:13:34.120]  You know, hear from an abortion insider the truth
[2:13:34.120 --> 2:13:38.120]  Tweet that, ATWN.org, online with us
[2:13:38.120 --> 2:13:44.120]  And look, to admit what's going on is to begin the healing
[2:13:44.120 --> 2:13:47.120]  I don't judge anybody that's been involved in this
[2:13:47.120 --> 2:13:49.120]  But frankly I've been involved in it
[2:13:49.120 --> 2:13:52.120]  You know, girlfriends would go get abortions even when I try to stop them
[2:13:52.120 --> 2:13:54.120]  But still I was involved
[2:13:54.120 --> 2:13:57.120]  I shouldn't have been doing what I was doing for it to go to that point
[2:13:57.120 --> 2:14:01.120]  And even though it makes me look bad, I need to publicly say, you know, that
[2:14:01.120 --> 2:14:05.120]  Because I want people to know that I'm not judging you
[2:14:05.120 --> 2:14:08.120]  Again, I'm ranting on the subject, I'm gonna skip this network break so she has more time
[2:14:08.120 --> 2:14:13.120]  ATTWN.org
[2:14:13.120 --> 2:14:17.120]  We'll put a link in the guest section of the news today as well on infowars.com
[2:14:17.120 --> 2:14:19.120]  Thank you for coming on with us
[2:14:19.120 --> 2:14:22.120]  You know, in the 15 minutes we've got together so
[2:14:22.120 --> 2:14:25.120]  Tell people what's really going on
[2:14:25.120 --> 2:14:28.120]  What's really happening as you sit on the stand
[2:14:28.120 --> 2:14:32.120]  In front of the jury that is America, North America, and the rest of the globe
[2:14:32.120 --> 2:14:34.120]  People tuning in from all over the world
[2:14:34.120 --> 2:14:38.120]  What's really going on with abortion? What's it really all about?
[2:14:38.120 --> 2:14:41.120]  And what makes Planned Parenthood tick?
[2:14:41.120 --> 2:14:45.120]  Coming on the show, I'd love to come in studio, I'm in Austin
[2:14:45.120 --> 2:14:51.120]  But I, you know, I think what people need to know is that
[2:14:51.120 --> 2:14:55.120]  And I think people do know this primarily, but a lot of people still deny it
[2:14:55.120 --> 2:15:01.120]  Is that the abortion industry is a profit-driven industry, period
[2:15:01.120 --> 2:15:04.120]  It's a money-driven industry
[2:15:04.120 --> 2:15:07.120]  It's an industry that sells abortion
[2:15:07.120 --> 2:15:11.120]  People don't like to hear that, but they are, you know
[2:15:11.120 --> 2:15:15.120]  These Planned Parenthood clinics and abortion clinics are giving out quotas
[2:15:15.120 --> 2:15:21.120]  For the amount of abortions that have to be sold to women coming in to those clinics
[2:15:21.120 --> 2:15:27.120]  So, you know, you become a salesperson for the product that they're selling
[2:15:27.120 --> 2:15:29.120]  And that's abortion
[2:15:29.120 --> 2:15:35.120]  And, you know, for me kind of seeing that corruption, seeing the malpractice
[2:15:35.120 --> 2:15:41.120]  And then ultimately seeing a 13-week-old baby on an ultrasound screen
[2:15:41.120 --> 2:15:44.120]  Triding for its life during an abortion
[2:15:44.120 --> 2:15:48.120]  That's what caused me to wake up and say, you know, I've got to get out of here
[2:15:48.120 --> 2:15:52.120]  I've been part of the problem and now I want to be part of the solution
[2:15:52.120 --> 2:15:59.120]  What do you make of the abortion seller, the abortion used car salesman
[2:15:59.120 --> 2:16:03.120]  A lady that came out in New Jersey and taped her abortion and said
[2:16:03.120 --> 2:16:07.120]  It's sweet, I'm keeping a picture, it's so loving, I love my baby
[2:16:07.120 --> 2:16:11.120]  It's the most sick, demonic poetry I've ever heard
[2:16:11.120 --> 2:16:14.120]  Out of the mouth of, in my opinion, an actual demon
[2:16:14.120 --> 2:16:16.120]  Have you seen that video?
[2:16:16.120 --> 2:16:18.120]  Yeah, I've seen it
[2:16:18.120 --> 2:16:22.120]  I sent Emily a letter, a personal letter, actually
[2:16:22.120 --> 2:16:25.120]  I sent it, certified, so I know she got it
[2:16:25.120 --> 2:16:31.120]  But, you know, I think we're living in a time where, I mean, you know
[2:16:31.120 --> 2:16:35.120]  Just what scripture says, I mean, good will be called evil and evil will be called good
[2:16:35.120 --> 2:16:42.120]  And, you know, we've got a wave of women out there who call themselves liberated
[2:16:42.120 --> 2:16:44.120]  They call themselves feminist
[2:16:44.120 --> 2:16:48.120]  What they don't understand is that they're actually being used and objectified
[2:16:48.120 --> 2:16:51.120]  By the abortion industry for profit
[2:16:51.120 --> 2:16:55.120]  And that's exactly what happened to that young woman, Emily Webb
[2:16:55.120 --> 2:17:01.120]  That she doesn't realize how she's being manipulated, but she's also part of
[2:17:01.120 --> 2:17:05.120]  She's part of their sales technique
[2:17:05.120 --> 2:17:09.120]  And so, you know, those are the people, really, that we're trying to reach
[2:17:09.120 --> 2:17:16.120]  To help them understand, like, you are giving, you are making this problem even bigger
[2:17:16.120 --> 2:17:21.120]  By saying, I'm a woman and I'm for women's rights, and that's why I support abortion
[2:17:21.120 --> 2:17:29.120]  Any woman who's worth her salt or, you know, really has a...
[2:17:29.120 --> 2:17:32.120]  Really thinks about this
[2:17:32.120 --> 2:17:36.120]  Critical thinking, you know, about the abortion issue
[2:17:36.120 --> 2:17:40.120]  Would know that women are just being used
[2:17:40.120 --> 2:17:46.120]  We're being used in this game that the abortion industry is playing
[2:17:46.120 --> 2:17:51.120]  And, you know, we've got Cecil Richards from Planned Parenthood telling us
[2:17:51.120 --> 2:17:53.120]  That this is a woman's rights issue
[2:17:53.120 --> 2:17:57.120]  And, you know, I mean, it's just a big political ploy
[2:17:57.120 --> 2:17:59.120]  And, unfortunately, women don't seem...
[2:17:59.120 --> 2:18:03.120]  A lot of women don't seem to be smart enough to see that for what it is
[2:18:03.120 --> 2:18:06.120]  And to get out of it
[2:18:06.120 --> 2:18:10.120]  Well, I totally agree with you looking in from the outside
[2:18:10.120 --> 2:18:15.120]  But brief folks on what's really going on out there
[2:18:15.120 --> 2:18:18.120]  And, of course, the tapes have come out all over the country
[2:18:18.120 --> 2:18:20.120]  Where people say, I want to give money to kill blacks
[2:18:20.120 --> 2:18:23.120]  They're like, absolutely, where Planned Parenthood came from
[2:18:23.120 --> 2:18:27.120]  I mean, you know, it's like the Democratic Party was founded the Klan
[2:18:27.120 --> 2:18:29.120]  Now they say the NRA is the Klan
[2:18:29.120 --> 2:18:34.120]  When it was founded to fight the Klan, they invert everything
[2:18:34.120 --> 2:18:37.120]  And it just goes on and on and on
[2:18:37.120 --> 2:18:40.120]  And they have these fundraisers in Austin and I see them around the country
[2:18:40.120 --> 2:18:43.120]  For, you know, come give money to Planned Parenthood, these big galas
[2:18:43.120 --> 2:18:46.120]  When Planned Parenthood has just got billions of dollars
[2:18:46.120 --> 2:18:48.120]  Warren Buffett funding it
[2:18:48.120 --> 2:18:50.120]  Bill and Melinda Gates funding it
[2:18:50.120 --> 2:18:53.120]  The Queen of England meeting about, you know, how do we kill these poor people
[2:18:53.120 --> 2:18:56.120]  Prince Charles, Prince Philip
[2:18:56.120 --> 2:18:59.120]  And then you can look at the public and say, well, there are too many poor people
[2:18:59.120 --> 2:19:00.120]  Let's kill them
[2:19:00.120 --> 2:19:03.120]  This attitude, now we're seeing old people aren't worth anything
[2:19:03.120 --> 2:19:05.120]  Or babies up to age three should be killed
[2:19:05.120 --> 2:19:07.120]  Or let's kill Down syndrome kids
[2:19:07.120 --> 2:19:10.120]  I mean, we know where this eugenics thing goes
[2:19:10.120 --> 2:19:13.120]  It goes to Hitler and beyond
[2:19:13.120 --> 2:19:20.120]  And so I want you to speak to women out there that have had abortions
[2:19:20.120 --> 2:19:23.120]  Because what I think is, what I know is they double down
[2:19:23.120 --> 2:19:25.120]  Once you've been involved in abortions
[2:19:25.120 --> 2:19:28.120]  Or once you've had girlfriends that have had them or, you know, whatever
[2:19:28.120 --> 2:19:31.120]  Even if you didn't like or approve of it, you got drug along
[2:19:31.120 --> 2:19:33.120]  We're going to skip the break, guys
[2:19:33.120 --> 2:19:40.120]  You will want to rationalize and do whatever you can
[2:19:40.120 --> 2:19:44.120]  You know, it's kind of like you demonize a country you want to invade and attack
[2:19:44.120 --> 2:19:47.120]  Or you demonize somebody before you rob them
[2:19:47.120 --> 2:19:51.120]  Or you make an excuse for why, you know, what you're doing, you're doing
[2:19:51.120 --> 2:19:56.120]  And for me, that's what has to be assaulted
[2:19:56.120 --> 2:19:59.120]  We have to strike at the root of this and say, listen
[2:19:59.120 --> 2:20:03.120]  Why do so many abortionists call babies ugly black babies?
[2:20:03.120 --> 2:20:06.120]  Why do they say nobody wants these Mexican babies? Let's kill them
[2:20:06.120 --> 2:20:09.120]  And then that's on the news
[2:20:09.120 --> 2:20:12.120]  I mean, I've always heard that mantra from abortion people
[2:20:12.120 --> 2:20:15.120]  Did you ever hear that?
[2:20:15.120 --> 2:20:17.120]  Yeah, I mean, it's strange
[2:20:17.120 --> 2:20:20.120]  I mean, looking back, I mean, looking back, I'm like, God
[2:20:20.120 --> 2:20:23.120]  I was like such an idiot for falling for all this kind of stuff
[2:20:23.120 --> 2:20:26.120]  But like, you know, looking back, I mean, you hear
[2:20:26.120 --> 2:20:31.120]  You know, we're helping poverty by killing people
[2:20:31.120 --> 2:20:39.120]  I mean, we're helping poverty by killing people who could potentially be in poverty
[2:20:39.120 --> 2:20:41.120]  Really, that's the solution
[2:20:41.120 --> 2:20:46.120]  That's the best solution that we have in the United States of America is to kill people
[2:20:46.120 --> 2:20:49.120]  You know, I don't know
[2:20:49.120 --> 2:20:56.120]  I just think that so many women have been duped into this lie
[2:20:56.120 --> 2:21:01.120]  Made to believe that abortion is liberating, it is empowering
[2:21:01.120 --> 2:21:05.120]  You know, for some women, we do see that they stand by that
[2:21:05.120 --> 2:21:09.120]  But I mean, honestly, I mean, I'm a woman that's had two abortions
[2:21:09.120 --> 2:21:14.120]  That regrets those two abortions and speaks publicly about them
[2:21:14.120 --> 2:21:20.120]  But there's nothing liberating about taking the life of your own unborn child
[2:21:20.120 --> 2:21:24.120]  There's nothing human about it, really
[2:21:24.120 --> 2:21:27.120]  And there's nothing civilized
[2:21:27.120 --> 2:21:34.120]  And so, you know, but I just think it's just been a nice tactic that's been used
[2:21:34.120 --> 2:21:38.120]  And waved in front of women's faces
[2:21:38.120 --> 2:21:45.120]  As a way to ultimately control us and enslave us into this culture of death
[2:21:45.120 --> 2:21:48.120]  And, you know, Halvita, I know it's going to be on later
[2:21:48.120 --> 2:21:52.120]  And she can talk more, you know, about the kind of the roots of Planned Parenthood
[2:21:52.120 --> 2:21:54.120]  And how it was founded and everything
[2:21:54.120 --> 2:21:58.120]  Even now, we look at where Planned Parenthood clinics are located
[2:21:58.120 --> 2:22:04.120]  And 79% of them are located in what is considered super minority areas
[2:22:04.120 --> 2:22:10.120]  They know their target, they know that they're going after those who are impoverished
[2:22:10.120 --> 2:22:14.120]  And if you look at the founding of Planned Parenthood through Margaret Sanger
[2:22:14.120 --> 2:22:17.120]  Who actively worked with Hitler
[2:22:17.120 --> 2:22:20.120]  And you see that, you know, her goal was to
[2:22:20.120 --> 2:22:22.120]  And she said it very clearly in her writing
[2:22:22.120 --> 2:22:26.120]  Her goal was to eliminate the minority population
[2:22:26.120 --> 2:22:31.120]  Calling them human weeds that needed to be exterminated from a human garden
[2:22:31.120 --> 2:22:34.120]  Saying that, you know, the most merciful thing a large family can do
[2:22:34.120 --> 2:22:36.120]  To one of its infant members to kill it
[2:22:36.120 --> 2:22:38.120]  And this is their founder
[2:22:38.120 --> 2:22:40.120]  And it's not just that, you know, okay, like,
[2:22:40.120 --> 2:22:43.120]  Hitler had ties to the founding of Volkswagen, right?
[2:22:43.120 --> 2:22:49.120]  Okay, but if Volkswagen was giving out an award every year in Hitler's name
[2:22:49.120 --> 2:22:53.120]  It would be blown, nobody would buy Volkswagen anymore, it would be crazy, right?
[2:22:53.120 --> 2:22:57.120]  But Planned Parenthood continues to celebrate their racist roots
[2:22:57.120 --> 2:23:02.120]  By giving out their top-honored awards in the name of Margaret Sanger every year
[2:23:02.120 --> 2:23:08.120]  People, they just don't understand what they're supporting when they're supporting Planned Parenthood
[2:23:08.120 --> 2:23:12.120]  They're not supporting women's rights, they're not supporting women's healthcare
[2:23:12.120 --> 2:23:19.120]  They're not supporting healthcare in general, they're supporting the killing of our unborn children
[2:23:19.120 --> 2:23:23.120]  And they're supporting the enslavement of women across our country
[2:23:23.120 --> 2:23:28.120]  I've actually had journalists, mainly female journalists, in my office repeatedly say
[2:23:28.120 --> 2:23:32.120]  So you really don't like Margaret Sanger or admire her
[2:23:32.120 --> 2:23:35.120]  And they actually shake their heads
[2:23:35.120 --> 2:23:39.120]  She's been Time Magazine Woman of the Year since she died
[2:23:39.120 --> 2:23:44.120]  And this was a woman who had basically love letters back and forth with Hitler
[2:23:44.120 --> 2:23:47.120]  Got awards from Hitler, she gave awards to Hitler
[2:23:47.120 --> 2:23:52.120]  And the issue is, it's not like it's some new organization
[2:23:52.120 --> 2:23:56.120]  And I get called racist by the controlled media
[2:23:56.120 --> 2:24:04.120]  Because I don't want totally open borders with poor people that are put on welfare to be abortion voters, basically
[2:24:04.120 --> 2:24:09.120]  I mean, that's what it is, that's the demographics, the Democrats admit that
[2:24:09.120 --> 2:24:13.120]  I'm not even a Republican, but the Democrats are trying to take over
[2:24:13.120 --> 2:24:17.120]  With abortion, guns, all of it, they want to force their will on us
[2:24:17.120 --> 2:24:19.120]  And they're going to bring an appliance population to do it
[2:24:19.120 --> 2:24:22.120]  They absolutely hate those Latin Americans
[2:24:22.120 --> 2:24:27.120]  They're giving them Gardasil shots down there forced under IMF and World Bank agreements
[2:24:27.120 --> 2:24:29.120]  That have been linked to sterilizing them
[2:24:29.120 --> 2:24:32.120]  And of course it's come out that indeed that's what Gardasil does in many cases
[2:24:32.120 --> 2:24:36.120]  So it's just so incredibly sick to see all this
[2:24:36.120 --> 2:24:41.120]  What do you expect them to do now that polls have reversed
[2:24:41.120 --> 2:24:46.120]  From a 1973 with over 65% for abortion and some of their stage polls
[2:24:46.120 --> 2:24:50.120]  To over 65-70% in a lot of polls I see, especially young people
[2:24:50.120 --> 2:24:54.120]  As public opinion swings against it, what do you expect?
[2:24:54.120 --> 2:25:00.120]  How will the Empire of Hitler and Margaret Sanger and John D. Rockefeller, that's who we found with the whole deal
[2:25:00.120 --> 2:25:02.120]  How will they strike back?
[2:25:02.120 --> 2:25:07.120]  Well, I think, you know, they are actively in our school system right now
[2:25:07.120 --> 2:25:14.120]  Look, parents think you'll wise up, you know, my kids aren't in public school because I don't want them there
[2:25:14.120 --> 2:25:17.120]  I don't trust what they'd be taught
[2:25:17.120 --> 2:25:22.120]  But, you know, for a lot of people, public school, they feel like that's the only option for their kids
[2:25:22.120 --> 2:25:23.120]  Parents need to wake up
[2:25:23.120 --> 2:25:27.120]  Plain Parenthood's agenda starts in kindergarten
[2:25:27.120 --> 2:25:30.120]  Their sex education program starts in kindergarten
[2:25:30.120 --> 2:25:34.120]  With your five-year-old children in that five-year-old classroom
[2:25:34.120 --> 2:25:39.120]  Involves showing them graphic sexual positions with stuffed animal
[2:25:39.120 --> 2:25:42.120]  I mean, parents need to wake up
[2:25:42.120 --> 2:25:46.120]  To be involved in what's going on with your children's school
[2:25:46.120 --> 2:25:50.120]  You need to be looking at who's coming in, giving these health presentations
[2:25:50.120 --> 2:25:54.120]  And if they say, oh, it's just a health group that's coming in, ask questions to it
[2:25:54.120 --> 2:25:58.120]  Because I would bet 99% of the time it's Plain Parenthood
[2:25:58.120 --> 2:26:03.120]  They're going to start trying to go after a younger and younger demographic
[2:26:03.120 --> 2:26:09.120]  Sarah Weddington, you know, who was the lawyer in Roe v. Wade
[2:26:09.120 --> 2:26:14.120]  Who pushed Roe v. Wade through, she just got up a few days ago and said
[2:26:14.120 --> 2:26:17.120]  Look, we don't have any young people in the pro-choice movement anymore
[2:26:17.120 --> 2:26:21.120]  You know, everybody that's pro-choice now, they're, you know, they're menopausal
[2:26:21.120 --> 2:26:25.120]  They're not even of fertility age anymore
[2:26:25.120 --> 2:26:31.120]  And so they're going to start really trying to dig in to our school systems, to our colleges
[2:26:31.120 --> 2:26:35.120]  We need to make pro-life warriors out of our kids
[2:26:35.120 --> 2:26:39.120]  So that when they're faced with this information from Plain Parenthood
[2:26:39.120 --> 2:26:43.120]  Because, look, wherever vulnerable women are, so is Plain Parenthood
[2:26:43.120 --> 2:26:48.120]  And there are hundreds of thousands of vulnerable young women and young children
[2:26:48.120 --> 2:26:52.120]  Inside of our school systems, and that includes the university system
[2:26:52.120 --> 2:26:58.120]  And so we as parents, and grandparents, need to do a better job of really teaching our children
[2:26:58.120 --> 2:27:03.120]  About the safety of human life from a scientific perspective as well as a religious perspective
[2:27:03.120 --> 2:27:05.120]  Well, you know what, you know what
[2:27:05.120 --> 2:27:10.120]  Absolutely, well, you know what B.F. Skinner and all the rest of them said they had to do
[2:27:10.120 --> 2:27:12.120]  With the Rockefeller Foundation, people can look all this up
[2:27:12.120 --> 2:27:17.120]  I mean, I've read multiple books on the subject, it's a public fact
[2:27:17.120 --> 2:27:24.120]  They went in and they said, we've got to promote promiscuity to break up the family
[2:27:24.120 --> 2:27:30.120]  So the state is the dad, and then we've got to basically use the poor people we can't exterminate
[2:27:30.120 --> 2:27:34.120]  As our new dumb-down political dependent class
[2:27:34.120 --> 2:27:38.120]  But then keep abortion going as well to control those numbers
[2:27:38.120 --> 2:27:42.120]  So they went in and caused the epidemic of out-of-wedlock children
[2:27:42.120 --> 2:27:47.120]  They created the crisis and they offer the solution, it's so evil
[2:27:47.120 --> 2:27:53.120]  Look, if your listeners want to see something really just disgusting
[2:27:53.120 --> 2:28:02.120]  They can go to my website, avyjohnson.org, in the search bar, type in Yaffe memo, J-A-F-F-E
[2:28:02.120 --> 2:28:06.120]  It came directly from Planned Parenthood's vice president back in the 60s
[2:28:06.120 --> 2:28:12.120]  It was a plan for how Planned Parenthood could destroy the family and increase the abortion numbers
[2:28:12.120 --> 2:28:17.120]  This was back in the 60s, and now we see that plan coming to fruition right in front of our face
[2:28:17.120 --> 2:28:22.120]  It's called the Yaffe memo, it's public, it's on my website, J-A-F-F-E
[2:28:22.120 --> 2:28:26.120]  Alright, and again, avyjohnson.org
[2:28:26.120 --> 2:28:30.120]  Briefly tell folks about that memo, and then I want to invite you next week or whenever you like
[2:28:30.120 --> 2:28:34.120]  To come in and spend an hour in studio with us, you can send exhibits before you come
[2:28:34.120 --> 2:28:37.120]  And we can have them up on the screen for the television viewers as well
[2:28:37.120 --> 2:28:43.120]  Yeah, we had a former worker from Planned Parenthood at the Rocky Mountains
[2:28:43.120 --> 2:28:46.120]  Which is located at affiliate headquarters in Denver
[2:28:46.120 --> 2:28:54.120]  That worker sent us an award, a picture of an award that was posted in the Aurora Health Center
[2:28:54.120 --> 2:29:01.120]  Planned Parenthood Health Center, stating that they had won this award for increasing their abortion numbers
[2:29:01.120 --> 2:29:05.120]  From fiscal year 2012 to fiscal year 2013
[2:29:05.120 --> 2:29:11.120]  And, you know, for years, for five years since being out of the industry, I've been talking about these abortion quotas
[2:29:11.120 --> 2:29:18.120]  Our ministry has a huge new video that's going to be out on Monday
[2:29:18.120 --> 2:29:21.120]  I would love to come out, I can send it to you
[2:29:21.120 --> 2:29:29.120]  But it's going to prove once and for all that Planned Parenthood does have these quotas that they have to meet
[2:29:29.120 --> 2:29:32.120]  And I really am interested to know how Planned Parenthood's going to respond
[2:29:32.120 --> 2:29:35.120]  This is Hugh, do you want to get in here next week, looking at this memo
[2:29:35.120 --> 2:29:38.120]  It's how to reduce the U.S. population, how to break up families
[2:29:38.120 --> 2:29:41.120]  It's all right there, just incredible blueprints
[2:29:41.120 --> 2:29:45.120]  And you can see it, folks, I mean, these people are our savage enemies
[2:29:45.120 --> 2:30:10.120]  God bless you, ma'am, we're going to talk to our next guest
[2:30:10.120 --> 2:30:15.120]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid
[2:30:15.120 --> 2:30:18.120]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group
[2:30:18.120 --> 2:30:23.120]  You now know it as survival shield, true nascent iodine that your body can really absorb
[2:30:23.120 --> 2:30:31.120]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals
[2:30:31.120 --> 2:30:35.120]  And the results that I personally have had have been life changing
[2:30:35.120 --> 2:30:40.120]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen
[2:30:40.120 --> 2:30:44.120]  This is innovating, and the best part is it helps fund infowars.com
[2:30:44.120 --> 2:30:47.120]  The radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation
[2:30:47.120 --> 2:30:49.120]  Promoting true libertarian ideas

[2:31:03.120 --> 2:31:07.120]  Our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day
[2:31:07.120 --> 2:31:09.120]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic
[2:31:09.120 --> 2:31:14.120]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air
[2:31:14.120 --> 2:31:19.120]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes
[2:31:19.120 --> 2:31:23.120]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States
[2:31:23.120 --> 2:31:27.120]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions
[2:31:27.120 --> 2:31:31.120]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well
[2:31:31.120 --> 2:31:34.120]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me
[2:31:34.120 --> 2:31:39.120]  It was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment
[2:31:39.120 --> 2:31:41.120]  That we cannot escape but that we can fight back against
[2:31:41.120 --> 2:31:46.120]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the U.S.A
[2:31:46.120 --> 2:31:50.120]  The new info wars life lung cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle

[2:32:02.120 --> 2:32:09.120]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available

[2:32:20.120 --> 2:32:28.120]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit
[2:32:28.120 --> 2:32:30.120]  Deep in the earth
[2:32:30.120 --> 2:32:34.120]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today
[2:32:34.120 --> 2:32:38.120]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop

[2:33:26.120 --> 2:33:35.120]  Desperately trying to shake the human community out of its induced, globalist eczema or coma
[2:33:35.120 --> 2:33:38.120]  I am your host, Alex Jones
[2:33:39.120 --> 2:33:46.120]  We are here, Monday through Friday, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central
[2:33:46.120 --> 2:33:53.120]  Weeknight 7 o'clock, info wars nightly news, you've been noticing that I'm every night either hosting part of or doing special reports
[2:33:53.120 --> 2:34:01.120]  On the nightly news, soon I intend to host at least three nights a week the entire transmission with our reporters, anchors, analysts, researchers
[2:34:01.120 --> 2:34:09.120]  And we're running a special in the month of July where you can get 5.3 months free
[2:34:09.120 --> 2:34:13.120]  That's 5.3 months free
[2:34:13.120 --> 2:34:21.120]  When you shine up for the yearly membership, so you pay for 6.7 months
[2:34:21.120 --> 2:34:28.120]  You get 5.3 months free, all my films, my book, Paul Watson's book, special live reports, the nightly news every night
[2:34:28.120 --> 2:34:35.120]  And so much more commercial free audio and video podcast of the daily radio show, all of it
[2:34:35.120 --> 2:34:42.120]  And again, if you can't afford a prisonplanet.tv membership, almost all of it, a lot of it ends up going on YouTube
[2:34:42.120 --> 2:34:47.120]  The next day for the whole world with our big channel with 400 million views
[2:34:47.120 --> 2:34:51.120]  We have other channels and yet our other auxiliary affiliate channels
[2:34:51.120 --> 2:34:54.120]  I've been trying to do the math, actually, it's bigger than I said
[2:34:54.120 --> 2:34:57.120]  We're up to about 800 million views on YouTube
[2:34:57.120 --> 2:35:01.120]  And for political news, that's dominant
[2:35:01.120 --> 2:35:06.120]  The White House videos get about 5,000 views on average now
[2:35:06.120 --> 2:35:09.120]  They only do a few a day
[2:35:09.120 --> 2:35:14.120]  Barack Obama, I remember he used to get 5 million views of the stupid Obama girl and all that
[2:35:14.120 --> 2:35:17.120]  Talk about rotting produce that nobody wants to buy
[2:35:17.120 --> 2:35:24.120]  Obama is really losing his own base because he has just betrayed everyone
[2:35:24.120 --> 2:35:28.120]  But that's part of the larger plan
[2:35:28.120 --> 2:35:32.120]  People need to know, obviously, it's not just Obama doing bad things
[2:35:32.120 --> 2:35:37.120]  Obama is the front man of this larger agenda
[2:35:37.120 --> 2:35:42.120]  But like a knight that has a shield that's dented and bruised
[2:35:42.120 --> 2:35:45.120]  They throw that down after 4 to 8 years and pick up a new one
[2:35:45.120 --> 2:35:51.120]  We need to stop letting presidents just be globalist bully pulpit drivers of agendas
[2:35:51.120 --> 2:35:56.120]  And get somebody good in there, obviously, that's obvious
[2:35:56.120 --> 2:36:03.120]  But when we attack Obama, it's because he is the sales vehicle for all these programs
[2:36:03.120 --> 2:36:10.120]  And now that he's unpopular, we can then shoot down, dismantle or shut down
[2:36:10.120 --> 2:36:15.120]  Or derail all the unconstitutional garbage that he's ran through
[2:36:15.120 --> 2:36:18.120]  Because the Supreme Court can rule his tyranny is constitutional all day
[2:36:18.120 --> 2:36:21.120]  Because of NSA blackmail and things that have come out
[2:36:21.120 --> 2:36:23.120]  Doesn't matter, we can have Congress move as a larger group
[2:36:23.120 --> 2:36:27.120]  It's harder for them to blackmail that whole group and repeal a bunch of this
[2:36:27.120 --> 2:36:33.120]  It's not even so much blackmail that they're using now as just the money of a special interest
[2:36:33.120 --> 2:36:42.120]  Now the bunch of buck passing crooks there in D.C. who all just deny
[2:36:42.120 --> 2:36:46.120]  Oh, we don't know why the TSA's on street corners now sticking their hands down your pants
[2:36:46.120 --> 2:36:50.120]  Oh, we don't know why Homeland Security federal police are now walking around
[2:36:50.120 --> 2:36:53.120]  Major cities saying, spy on your neighbors, that's in the news today
[2:36:53.120 --> 2:36:59.120]  We don't know, gee, he did it, they did it, it's all a bunch of people with plausible deniability
[2:36:59.120 --> 2:37:10.120]  And this is the criminal system that the globalists operate
[2:37:10.120 --> 2:37:18.120]  And I don't know the proper term for it, but it's an oligarchy of the Telekterianism
[2:37:18.120 --> 2:37:23.120]  But it's a large combine of individuals where they all work in different sectors
[2:37:23.120 --> 2:37:29.120]  So that no one can be blamed for running at all
[2:37:29.120 --> 2:37:32.120]  And well, we got laws passed that we were allowed to create derivatives
[2:37:32.120 --> 2:37:36.120]  Well, we passed a law to reform that that gave us more power to do it
[2:37:36.120 --> 2:37:38.120]  And we legalized insider trading
[2:37:38.120 --> 2:37:43.120]  Well, I don't care if you say it's legal that you're allowed to insider trade in Congress
[2:37:43.120 --> 2:37:45.120]  But no one else is
[2:37:45.120 --> 2:37:47.120]  That is discriminatory, it's a fraud
[2:37:47.120 --> 2:37:51.120]  In Congress, you're a bankrupt criminal group on average
[2:37:51.120 --> 2:37:59.120]  And so we need to support the individuals that criticize that and expose it
[2:37:59.120 --> 2:38:05.120]  I mean, it really is over the top
[2:38:05.120 --> 2:38:09.120]  I started reading her book last weekend, I've gotten about halfway through, it's been very busy
[2:38:09.120 --> 2:38:11.120]  It's excellent
[2:38:11.120 --> 2:38:15.120]  And it's something I think that really everybody should read
[2:38:15.120 --> 2:38:17.120]  It's called Liberals
[2:38:17.120 --> 2:38:20.120]  They think they know Dr. Martin Luther King
[2:38:20.120 --> 2:38:23.120]  They could actually hear his quotes, his letters, what he really stood for
[2:38:23.120 --> 2:38:27.120]  And then a contemporary example of what's going on today
[2:38:27.120 --> 2:38:32.120]  So who was Dr. Martin Luther King? Was he who the FBI basically lied to say he was?
[2:38:32.120 --> 2:38:36.120]  Or was in their COINTELPRO? Or is he who the Democrats say he is?
[2:38:36.120 --> 2:38:40.120]  Or is he even who the Republicans say he is? And the answer is no
[2:38:40.120 --> 2:38:46.120]  The lady that has done a great job, Dr. Elvita King, guardian of the King family legacy
[2:38:46.120 --> 2:38:50.120]  Is a minister of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, a grateful mother and grandmother
[2:38:50.120 --> 2:38:54.120]  She's a former college professor, author, mentor, stage and screen actress
[2:38:54.120 --> 2:38:56.120]  I've seen her in quite a few movies
[2:38:56.120 --> 2:39:00.120]  Georgia State Legislator and presidential appointing
[2:39:00.120 --> 2:39:08.120]  And she joins us now, great book by Nelson Books that I intend to finish by Friday
[2:39:08.120 --> 2:39:10.120]  I'm going to read it some more tonight if I have time
[2:39:10.120 --> 2:39:17.120]  But she joins us now to discuss the book King Rules
[2:39:17.120 --> 2:39:21.120]  The Truths for You, Your Family and Our Nation to Prosper
[2:39:21.120 --> 2:39:26.120]  Live the Dream of A.D. King, Daddy King and MLK
[2:39:26.120 --> 2:39:32.120]  So tell us about this family and where Martin Luther King came from
[2:39:32.120 --> 2:39:35.120]  I think that's important to understand where we are
[2:39:35.120 --> 2:39:42.120]  Because this journey is a classic American journey of being a true folk hero and trailblazer
[2:39:42.120 --> 2:39:46.120]  Well, you know, thank you, honestly
[2:39:46.120 --> 2:39:50.120]  But the opportunity that he would join you today in your listening audience
[2:39:50.120 --> 2:39:53.120]  And it's so amazing as you ask that question
[2:39:53.120 --> 2:39:57.120]  Because I was listening to all your comments as you were bringing me in with the intro
[2:39:57.120 --> 2:39:59.120]  And everything that's happening in the news
[2:39:59.120 --> 2:40:02.120]  I'll be honest with you, I don't look at the news all the time
[2:40:02.120 --> 2:40:05.120]  Just to get a barometer
[2:40:05.120 --> 2:40:10.120]  But some things are so fantastic or fantastical, which isn't a word
[2:40:10.120 --> 2:40:18.120]  Now we've got the current House getting ready to sue the president and etc
[2:40:18.120 --> 2:40:23.120]  And the one point that you made about him being like pretty much a mousey
[2:40:23.120 --> 2:40:28.120]  President Obama is not the one that's totally doing all that
[2:40:28.120 --> 2:40:33.120]  There's a machine that drives this and he's just right in front of that machine
[2:40:33.120 --> 2:40:39.120]  And so as I begin to look at everything and continue to see all of the breakdown
[2:40:39.120 --> 2:40:42.120]  In our society today in America across the country
[2:40:42.120 --> 2:40:48.120]  I'm very disturbed about the children who are being brought over
[2:40:48.120 --> 2:40:50.120]  And just kind of left on the borders
[2:40:50.120 --> 2:40:55.120]  And I'm astounded by the things that I'm hanging the media now
[2:40:55.120 --> 2:40:58.120]  Let's send them back, they don't belong here, let's keep them
[2:40:58.120 --> 2:41:00.120]  Without any real plan or knowledge
[2:41:00.120 --> 2:41:02.120]  How to help the children
[2:41:02.120 --> 2:41:04.120]  The sanity of people saying
[2:41:04.120 --> 2:41:08.120]  We have a moral obligation to help children everywhere whenever they need
[2:41:08.120 --> 2:41:11.120]  But then there has to be some logic to it
[2:41:11.120 --> 2:41:15.120]  And then everybody, the children are suffering with the blame game going
[2:41:15.120 --> 2:41:18.120]  Now I'm saying all of this to say that
[2:41:18.120 --> 2:41:22.120]  During the time that Martin Luther King Jr. was alive and here on Earth in the 20th century
[2:41:22.120 --> 2:41:26.120]  During the time my father, his brother, Reverend A.D. King, was here
[2:41:26.120 --> 2:41:28.120]  My grandfather, Dr. Martin Luther King Sr.
[2:41:28.120 --> 2:41:30.120]  We had order, we had rule
[2:41:30.120 --> 2:41:34.120]  There were things that we were able to pattern our lives by
[2:41:34.120 --> 2:41:38.120]  Were we perfect? No, am I perfect today? No
[2:41:38.120 --> 2:41:43.120]  But we have always been imperfect humans in the King family legacy
[2:41:43.120 --> 2:41:45.120]  Who serve a perfect God
[2:41:45.120 --> 2:41:49.120]  With love and compassion being the order of the day, the rule of the day
[2:41:49.120 --> 2:41:53.120]  Which is why you'll find a chapter in that Book of Beloved Community
[2:41:53.120 --> 2:41:57.120]  So I actually wrote that book for my children and grandchildren
[2:41:57.120 --> 2:42:00.120]  I know you've got some questions, I'm going to want to wrap this one up
[2:42:00.120 --> 2:42:03.120]  So my son said to me the other day, my youngest son is 24
[2:42:03.120 --> 2:42:06.120]  He said, I'm sad, your book is making me sad, I said, why?
[2:42:06.120 --> 2:42:10.120]  He said, all the things that you talk about in that book
[2:42:10.120 --> 2:42:12.120]  I didn't have, I said, what do you mean?
[2:42:12.120 --> 2:42:15.120]  I've been here, he said, but the patriarchs
[2:42:15.120 --> 2:42:17.120]  I didn't have a real patriarch
[2:42:17.120 --> 2:42:19.120]  My grandfather, I didn't know him
[2:42:19.120 --> 2:42:21.120]  My great-grandfather, I did not know him
[2:42:21.120 --> 2:42:23.120]  My uncle, I did not know him
[2:42:23.120 --> 2:42:26.120]  And you know, his daddy and I are divorced
[2:42:26.120 --> 2:42:29.120]  He said, so all the things you say in the book, Mom, are right
[2:42:29.120 --> 2:42:32.120]  You're trying to give us those things today
[2:42:32.120 --> 2:42:34.120]  But I didn't always have them
[2:42:34.120 --> 2:42:37.120]  So America, we have a law standard
[2:42:37.120 --> 2:42:42.120]  And we want to kind of throw rocks at one individual, President Obama
[2:42:42.120 --> 2:42:46.120]  And you know I do not agree with the policies of President Barack Obama
[2:42:46.120 --> 2:42:48.120]  I do not
[2:42:48.120 --> 2:42:50.120]  I've been to the White House twice, told him I love him
[2:42:50.120 --> 2:42:53.120]  I'm praying for him, but I don't agree with his policies
[2:42:53.120 --> 2:42:59.120]  So I wrote the book, hopefully we raise a standard that works
[2:42:59.120 --> 2:43:04.120]  Well, the globalist starting with the Native American
[2:43:04.120 --> 2:43:06.120]  And then black communities on record
[2:43:06.120 --> 2:43:09.120]  Brought in the social engineering, I know you're an expert on that
[2:43:09.120 --> 2:43:12.120]  And in Margaret Sanger and Hitler and all the rest of it
[2:43:12.120 --> 2:43:15.120]  And the Rockefellers, this is too wild
[2:43:15.120 --> 2:43:19.120]  To even try to encapsulate it on the radio
[2:43:19.120 --> 2:43:22.120]  But I'd like you to speak some to that
[2:43:22.120 --> 2:43:25.120]  And the targeting of the human family and the human system
[2:43:25.120 --> 2:43:29.120]  Perfected on black people now being deployed against everyone
[2:43:29.120 --> 2:43:33.120]  The devastating effect, but before we go there
[2:43:33.120 --> 2:43:35.120]  And give you just join us folks, Alveda King
[2:43:35.120 --> 2:43:37.120]  Dr. Alveda King is on with us, she has the new book
[2:43:37.120 --> 2:43:39.120]  Already becoming a bestseller, King Rules just came out
[2:43:39.120 --> 2:43:43.120]  10 truths for you, your family, and our nation to prosper
[2:43:43.120 --> 2:43:46.120]  And I agree with so much of what's in there
[2:43:46.120 --> 2:43:49.120]  It's very touching, talk about though the other men
[2:43:49.120 --> 2:43:52.120]  Always hear about Martin Luther King, we don't hear about his dad or his brother
[2:43:52.120 --> 2:43:56.120]  And break down the book for people and some of the standards that were there
[2:43:56.120 --> 2:43:59.120]  For people to, from the numbers I've seen
[2:43:59.120 --> 2:44:01.120]  Lower illegitimacy in the black community
[2:44:01.120 --> 2:44:04.120]  In the 40s and 50s and things
[2:44:04.120 --> 2:44:07.120]  In most areas of the country than what you had in the white community
[2:44:07.120 --> 2:44:12.120]  And just the complete destruction in my view of culture
[2:44:12.120 --> 2:44:15.120]  That we see by design, and why do you think that's happening?
[2:44:15.120 --> 2:44:19.120]  Well, you know, in part all of that
[2:44:19.120 --> 2:44:21.120]  That we were saying about the socialist agenda
[2:44:21.120 --> 2:44:25.120]  For those who wanted to label my uncle Martin Luther King Jr
[2:44:25.120 --> 2:44:28.120]  My uncle M.Hale as a socialist communist
[2:44:28.120 --> 2:44:31.120]  My uncle was never a communist, now
[2:44:31.120 --> 2:44:35.120]  The gospel of Jesus Christ where Jesus talked
[2:44:35.120 --> 2:44:37.120]  That everybody should have a place to sleep
[2:44:37.120 --> 2:44:40.120]  Somewhere, something to eat, to be treated compassionately
[2:44:40.120 --> 2:44:45.120]  The sermon of the Good Samaritan is the one that my uncle preached along those lines
[2:44:45.120 --> 2:44:48.120]  But my uncle never embraced a communist agenda
[2:44:48.120 --> 2:44:50.120]  That's just not true
[2:44:50.120 --> 2:44:53.120]  And the socialist idea of the government
[2:44:53.120 --> 2:44:56.120]  Providing everything, you need a big brother
[2:44:56.120 --> 2:44:58.120]  You need a new plantation
[2:44:58.120 --> 2:45:00.120]  Like in the days of slavery
[2:45:00.120 --> 2:45:04.120]  Where the slaves were, you know, giving all the free labor and everything
[2:45:04.120 --> 2:45:09.120]  And they were getting somewhat handout from the master
[2:45:09.120 --> 2:45:12.120]  And so the government, my uncle, of course, said that
[2:45:12.120 --> 2:45:15.120]  The law cannot make someone love me
[2:45:15.120 --> 2:45:18.120]  But the law can keep someone from lynching me
[2:45:18.120 --> 2:45:21.120]  So people have to really understand that
[2:45:21.120 --> 2:45:25.120]  My uncle, being a very intelligent man, but definitely a godly man
[2:45:25.120 --> 2:45:29.120]  Understood that there is a place for government, human government
[2:45:29.120 --> 2:45:34.120]  But that the rule of God, which is the God who loves superseded that
[2:45:34.120 --> 2:45:36.120]  So that's exactly what he taught
[2:45:36.120 --> 2:45:40.120]  And I challenge anybody, especially after my uncle Martin Luther King Jr.
[2:45:40.120 --> 2:45:43.120]  Uncle and male took the call to preach the gospel
[2:45:43.120 --> 2:45:47.120]  In his earlier days as a college student, as a high school student
[2:45:47.120 --> 2:45:49.120]  He looked at all the philosophies of the world
[2:45:49.120 --> 2:45:51.120]  He studied many philosophers
[2:45:51.120 --> 2:45:52.120]  Gandhi was one
[2:45:52.120 --> 2:45:56.120]  Well, plus, plus, it's like saying Thomas Jefferson was racist
[2:45:56.120 --> 2:46:00.120]  When he was actually a trailblazer trying to end a lot of things
[2:46:00.120 --> 2:46:03.120]  It was the time that someone was alive
[2:46:03.120 --> 2:46:06.120]  When the socialists were trying to embrace Martin Luther King
[2:46:06.120 --> 2:46:08.120]  From my research, correct me if I'm wrong
[2:46:08.120 --> 2:46:10.120]  That he would go and speak to any group or whatever
[2:46:10.120 --> 2:46:15.120]  And obviously the left, at that time, wanted to co-opt him
[2:46:15.120 --> 2:46:19.120]  But no one could imagine that there was an even more insidious plan
[2:46:19.120 --> 2:46:23.120]  To use government empowerment to actually enslave people
[2:46:23.120 --> 2:46:27.120]  I mean, he would have had to have a time machine in the 1950s
[2:46:27.120 --> 2:46:29.120]  To know things like this
[2:46:29.120 --> 2:46:33.120]  Basically to that, oh, I'm so glad you dropped that one off
[2:46:33.120 --> 2:46:36.120]  I have a chapter in the book that says, get a good education
[2:46:36.120 --> 2:46:39.120]  But education cannot be God
[2:46:39.120 --> 2:46:43.120]  So, I guess I had written about the constitution and the founding fathers
[2:46:43.120 --> 2:46:45.120]  Which I really didn't in the book
[2:46:45.120 --> 2:46:47.120]  But they were imperfect men
[2:46:47.120 --> 2:46:48.120]  They were not perfect
[2:46:48.120 --> 2:46:50.120]  They knew slavery was wrong
[2:46:50.120 --> 2:46:52.120]  Almost all of them did wonderful roles
[2:46:52.120 --> 2:46:54.120]  And I'm still sad to find out which one it actually was
[2:46:54.120 --> 2:46:57.120]  He said, if there's a God we're in trouble because slavery is wrong
[2:46:57.120 --> 2:47:00.120]  If we knew it, then the excuse comes up
[2:47:00.120 --> 2:47:03.120]  Well, it was wrong, but that's the way it was in those times
[2:47:03.120 --> 2:47:05.120]  We did the best we could
[2:47:05.120 --> 2:47:08.120]  Some of them actually did free slaves during their lifetime
[2:47:08.120 --> 2:47:10.120]  Or upon their death
[2:47:10.120 --> 2:47:14.120]  And so I said that if the founding fathers knew slavery was wrong
[2:47:14.120 --> 2:47:18.120]  Many of them absolutely said it was wrong
[2:47:18.120 --> 2:47:21.120]  But some of them still own slaves
[2:47:21.120 --> 2:47:25.120]  And so I said that I wish they had had the courage to do
[2:47:25.120 --> 2:47:28.120]  To stand up even a little more firmly and a little against it
[2:47:28.120 --> 2:47:33.120]  I think Ben Franklin did have one slave and he freeed that slave
[2:47:33.120 --> 2:47:35.120]  You know, I'm studying all of them now
[2:47:35.120 --> 2:47:38.120]  I'm really looking before I talk about it
[2:47:38.120 --> 2:47:41.120]  But that's back to the point of
[2:47:41.120 --> 2:47:43.120]  When I do wrong
[2:47:43.120 --> 2:47:45.120]  And I want God's word to change
[2:47:45.120 --> 2:47:47.120]  And I try to change it because I want to do what I want
[2:47:47.120 --> 2:47:49.120]  If God's word is not going to change
[2:47:49.120 --> 2:47:51.120]  God's word is going to change me
[2:47:51.120 --> 2:47:54.120]  And from what I found out from the founding fathers
[2:47:54.120 --> 2:47:56.120]  What I knew about my uncle Martin Luther King Jr.
[2:47:56.120 --> 2:47:58.120]  Uncle ML, my daddy AC
[2:47:58.120 --> 2:47:59.120]  Definitely not perfect
[2:47:59.120 --> 2:48:01.120]  Daddy King, not perfect, I'm not perfect
[2:48:01.120 --> 2:48:03.120]  I've had abortions
[2:48:03.120 --> 2:48:06.120]  I did divorce three times
[2:48:06.120 --> 2:48:09.120]  I've just done things, but I have repented
[2:48:09.120 --> 2:48:11.120]  I've asked God to strengthen me and help me
[2:48:11.120 --> 2:48:15.120]  So when we as human beings make these terrible human errors
[2:48:15.120 --> 2:48:18.120]  Ben, that doesn't change the standard
[2:48:18.120 --> 2:48:21.120]  Those 10 rules that I've written about in that book
[2:48:21.120 --> 2:48:24.120]  You make your home a priority to serve your family
[2:48:24.120 --> 2:48:26.120]  Get a good education
[2:48:26.120 --> 2:48:29.120]  Guard your heart and your body
[2:48:29.120 --> 2:48:31.120]  And your human sexuality
[2:48:31.120 --> 2:48:33.120]  That's what that chapter is about
[2:48:33.120 --> 2:48:35.120]  To spend life
[2:48:35.120 --> 2:48:37.120]  To spend those on the peace and justice
[2:48:37.120 --> 2:48:40.120]  Caring for the needy, the beloved community
[2:48:40.120 --> 2:48:42.120]  And it ends up with time to enjoy
[2:48:42.120 --> 2:48:44.120]  Those are real genuine standards
[2:48:44.120 --> 2:48:46.120]  That transcend all time
[2:48:46.120 --> 2:48:49.120]  That transcend all human error
[2:48:49.120 --> 2:48:52.120]  I was very honest in the book about things that I've done
[2:48:52.120 --> 2:48:56.120]  I really, it wasn't an expose on other people
[2:48:56.120 --> 2:48:58.120]  So I could have talked about others
[2:48:58.120 --> 2:49:01.120]  And shown how imperfect every human being is
[2:49:01.120 --> 2:49:03.120]  But what I really was trying to show
[2:49:03.120 --> 2:49:05.120]  Was the perfection of those standards
[2:49:05.120 --> 2:49:07.120]  And the perfection of God
[2:49:07.120 --> 2:49:09.120]  Well, I found it's important
[2:49:09.120 --> 2:49:12.120]  To publicly admit things you've done
[2:49:12.120 --> 2:49:14.120]  And to not be arrogant
[2:49:14.120 --> 2:49:17.120]  I think that's the beginning of always getting our heart right
[2:49:17.120 --> 2:49:19.120]  To King David, all the things he did
[2:49:19.120 --> 2:49:22.120]  But he really repented and he had in his heart
[2:49:22.120 --> 2:49:24.120]  Oh, yes, yes
[2:49:24.120 --> 2:49:26.120]  David Paul was the killer
[2:49:26.120 --> 2:49:28.120]  You know, in the New Testament
[2:49:28.120 --> 2:49:30.120]  His name was Saul B. K. Paul
[2:49:30.120 --> 2:49:32.120]  But he killed Christian
[2:49:32.120 --> 2:49:34.120]  It was so bad that when God told him to go and talk to him
[2:49:34.120 --> 2:49:36.120]  He said, they're gonna kill me
[2:49:36.120 --> 2:49:38.120]  I used to kill him
[2:49:38.120 --> 2:49:40.120]  No, I can't go
[2:49:40.120 --> 2:49:42.120]  And God, of course, protected him and let him do it
[2:49:42.120 --> 2:49:44.120]  So, and that's even
[2:49:44.120 --> 2:49:46.120]  As I say with President Obama
[2:49:46.120 --> 2:49:48.120]  100% his policy
[2:49:48.120 --> 2:49:51.120]  And I could go beyond the HHS mandate
[2:49:51.120 --> 2:49:52.120]  Which is terrible
[2:49:52.120 --> 2:49:54.120]  Do you know what women are buying?
[2:49:54.120 --> 2:49:56.120]  And I was listening to Hillary Clinton
[2:49:56.120 --> 2:49:58.120]  Just real quick, Dr. King
[2:49:58.120 --> 2:50:01.120]  Your phone audio just got weak
[2:50:01.120 --> 2:50:03.120]  Can you talk right into it
[2:50:03.120 --> 2:50:05.120]  Or go back to what you were doing?
[2:50:05.120 --> 2:50:07.120]  Yes, because I really want to make this point
[2:50:07.120 --> 2:50:09.120]  I was listening to Hillary Clinton
[2:50:09.120 --> 2:50:11.120]  On the news today
[2:50:11.120 --> 2:50:14.120]  And Nancy Pelosi said something about
[2:50:14.120 --> 2:50:16.120]  The Democrats about the accident
[2:50:16.120 --> 2:50:18.120]  The Republicans about studying things
[2:50:18.120 --> 2:50:20.120]  You know, I'm paraphrasing
[2:50:20.120 --> 2:50:22.120]  And then Hillary was on
[2:50:22.120 --> 2:50:24.120]  But the Pelosi killer
[2:50:24.120 --> 2:50:26.120]  The CEO of Planned Parenthood
[2:50:26.120 --> 2:50:28.120]  I called them the terrible trio
[2:50:28.120 --> 2:50:30.120]  The free ladies
[2:50:30.120 --> 2:50:32.120]  And they are selling women
[2:50:32.120 --> 2:50:34.120]  Especially single women in this country
[2:50:34.120 --> 2:50:36.120]  They're selling an agenda
[2:50:36.120 --> 2:50:38.120]  And I hope ladies are really listening to this
[2:50:38.120 --> 2:50:40.120]  No, in the HHS mandate
[2:50:40.120 --> 2:50:41.120]  I'll tell you, stay there
[2:50:41.120 --> 2:50:43.120]  We're gonna come back to that agenda, Doc
[2:50:43.120 --> 2:50:45.120]  In this segment, we'll have six minutes
[2:50:45.120 --> 2:50:47.120]  On the other side with Dr. Alveda C. King
[2:50:47.120 --> 2:50:49.120]  FreezeForLife.org
[2:50:49.120 --> 2:50:51.120]  Her new book, King Rules
[2:50:51.120 --> 2:50:53.120]  And you can find it
[2:50:53.120 --> 2:50:55.120]  In a lot of bookstores
[2:50:55.120 --> 2:50:57.120]  Or on Amazon, we'll be right back
[2:50:57.120 --> 2:50:59.120]  Stay with us, final segment
[2:50:59.120 --> 2:51:20.120]  And we'll see you next time
[2:51:29.120 --> 2:51:31.120]  We the people grow cotton, we fabric
[2:51:31.120 --> 2:51:33.120]  Engrave ink, embed strips and fibers
[2:51:33.120 --> 2:51:35.120]  To protect from counterfeit and carting to a private bank
[2:51:35.120 --> 2:51:37.120]  Having it led back at interest
[2:51:37.120 --> 2:51:39.120]  Forcing taxes to serve as debt
[2:51:39.120 --> 2:51:41.120]  This capitalism, or was Jefferson correct
[2:51:41.120 --> 2:51:43.120]  When stating a central bank issuing the public currency
[2:51:43.120 --> 2:51:45.120]  Is a greater menace to the liberties of the people
[2:51:45.120 --> 2:51:47.120]  Than a standing army
[2:51:47.120 --> 2:51:49.120]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book

[2:54:19.280 --> 2:54:24.240]  Clive and Bundy is a fossil hillbilly living out in the desert.
[2:54:24.240 --> 2:54:30.120]  When he made those statements about weren't black folks better when they lived out in
[2:54:30.120 --> 2:54:34.440]  the woods and had their own tomatoes and pigs and goats, and the media said that was racist.
[2:54:34.440 --> 2:54:42.640]  No, that was a caveman saying, I won't live out in the woods and have tomatoes and chickens.
[2:54:42.640 --> 2:54:46.880]  I don't want to live in them scary cities while there's slaves in those cities.
[2:54:46.880 --> 2:54:50.200]  And they went, oh, you're being racist, whatever.
[2:54:50.200 --> 2:54:55.440]  The point is, is that they've traded one slavery for another slavery, and we're all doing that.
[2:54:55.440 --> 2:54:58.400]  And that's what Cloward and Piven and all of this is about, and that's why they want
[2:54:58.400 --> 2:55:03.800]  the borders open with all these people, is so they can get groups that are dependent.
[2:55:03.800 --> 2:55:08.640]  And I understand they use our compassion, but where do you think all this is going?
[2:55:08.640 --> 2:55:12.280]  Do you agree or do you want to amend that statement I just made, Dr. King?
[2:55:12.280 --> 2:55:17.560]  And then I want to spend a few minutes on current politics and Planned Parenthood.
[2:55:17.560 --> 2:55:20.760]  Alex, you're, what's the statement that you just made?
[2:55:20.760 --> 2:55:26.600]  There are different forms of slavery and it's lack of understanding, lack of insight, lack
[2:55:26.600 --> 2:55:34.160]  of truth and reality that puts us into knowledge, whether it be physical or emotional or mental.
[2:55:34.160 --> 2:55:37.840]  And you know, it could be sickness, it could be restraint, it could be oppression from
[2:55:37.840 --> 2:55:38.840]  humans.
[2:55:38.840 --> 2:55:39.840]  There are so many things.
[2:55:39.840 --> 2:55:44.800]  One of the most hilarious things that's going on right now, Pelosi and the gang are heading
[2:55:44.800 --> 2:55:50.520]  this up, Clinton, Cecil Richards, all of them, they are, and they're really preying on single
[2:55:50.520 --> 2:55:58.560]  women, young ladies from teenage up to about 33, and they're saying that the evil republicans
[2:55:58.560 --> 2:56:03.520]  want to keep you in peaceful life with the 8th, 8th, 10th, 10th, 8th lawsuits and hobby
[2:56:03.520 --> 2:56:04.520]  lobbies.
[2:56:04.520 --> 2:56:07.160]  They don't want you to have rebirth control.
[2:56:07.160 --> 2:56:13.160]  They want to put you back and buy the slavery and keep you from expressing your sexuality.
[2:56:13.160 --> 2:56:19.520]  Well, the program, the 8th, 8th, 10th mandate, the pre-birth control is going to be $9 a
[2:56:19.520 --> 2:56:20.520]  month.
[2:56:20.520 --> 2:56:25.760]  Listen, as you can check that out for yourself, how much will be allowed for a baby, $9 a month.
[2:56:25.760 --> 2:56:32.440]  Most of us ladies, I don't care what our situation happens to be, we can probably find $9 a month.
[2:56:32.440 --> 2:56:37.040]  And so I told, I actually said, I have daughters and granddaughters, they don't need free
[2:56:37.040 --> 2:56:42.480]  birth control, they need good education, they need good food that will not make them sick.
[2:56:42.480 --> 2:56:47.440]  They need safety and security so they won't end up in sex trafficking.
[2:56:47.440 --> 2:56:51.440]  Those are the kinds of things that my daughters and granddaughters need, and that's what women
[2:56:51.440 --> 2:56:52.440]  need.
[2:56:52.440 --> 2:56:57.560]  And the easiest way to liberate a woman about her sexuality is to let her determine when
[2:56:57.560 --> 2:56:59.880]  she will have sex and when she will not.
[2:56:59.880 --> 2:57:07.240]  Get her a $1 ovulation kit from the dollar store that lets her know when she's ovulating,
[2:57:07.240 --> 2:57:13.040]  a $1 kit she can buy herself, and a woman can not get pregnant when she's not ovulating.
[2:57:13.040 --> 2:57:18.680]  So that impacts her, I control my sexuality, I say, wait, I'm going to have sex, so don't
[2:57:18.680 --> 2:57:23.760]  rape me, don't force me, don't tie me down, don't give me artificial chemicals and shots
[2:57:23.760 --> 2:57:27.480]  and pills and abortions that are going to give me strokes and heart attacks and breast
[2:57:27.480 --> 2:57:28.480]  cancer.
[2:57:28.480 --> 2:57:34.200]  And let me say, when I will have sex, and if I want to baby, I'll have to when I ovulate
[2:57:34.200 --> 2:57:36.200]  if I don't, I won't.
[2:57:36.200 --> 2:57:38.800]  That's too simple, and Hillary, they know this.
[2:57:38.800 --> 2:57:39.800]  The gang just called.
[2:57:39.800 --> 2:57:44.160]  That's right, they won't teach women, all the ancient women knew how to control women
[2:57:44.160 --> 2:57:45.160]  when they got pregnant.
[2:57:45.160 --> 2:57:46.160]  That's right.
[2:57:46.160 --> 2:57:50.840]  I mean, they all knew, but they will not teach women how to take control, they have the state
[2:57:50.840 --> 2:57:53.120]  doing it, and calling that freedom.
[2:57:53.120 --> 2:57:58.360]  And we need to control our own sexuality, I'm a feminist, but I'm a liberator.
[2:57:58.360 --> 2:57:59.360]  I'm a feminist.
[2:57:59.360 --> 2:58:02.720]  So they'll be actually kind of a feminist, you know what I'm saying?
[2:58:02.720 --> 2:58:08.800]  So I think that those ladies are being notorious, and they need to stop lying to women.
[2:58:08.800 --> 2:58:12.600]  Well, they don't want men to know their bodies, women to know their bodies, they just want
[2:58:12.600 --> 2:58:13.600]  it totally ignorant.
[2:58:13.600 --> 2:58:18.000]  Well, if you're ever coming through Texas, we'd love to have you in studio.
[2:58:18.000 --> 2:58:21.960]  And Dr. King, thank you so much for the time, I look forward to speaking to you again in
[2:58:21.960 --> 2:58:22.960]  the future.
[2:58:22.960 --> 2:58:25.680]  Alex, thanks for the opportunity, God bless you and your listeners.
[2:58:25.680 --> 2:58:26.680]  Thank you.
[2:58:26.680 --> 2:58:27.680]  God bless you.
[2:58:27.680 --> 2:58:31.200]  I think when we put this interview out on prisonplanet.tv later, I think I'm going to
[2:58:31.200 --> 2:58:34.320]  flip the interview with the first part of the beginning and the rest after, because
[2:58:34.320 --> 2:58:35.320]  her phone got better.
[2:58:35.320 --> 2:58:38.280]  I'm going to do some overdrive and go to Carlos and others that have been holding.
[2:58:38.280 --> 2:58:44.160]  You're real troopers, Carlos and Ted, and Rinell, I got to shut up and go right to you.
[2:58:44.160 --> 2:58:46.160]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[2:58:46.160 --> 2:58:49.800]  Sarah's got a flyer on the world government.
[2:58:49.800 --> 2:58:52.560]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[2:58:52.560 --> 2:58:58.640]  Male vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using
[2:58:58.640 --> 2:59:04.280]  synthetic chemicals sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet
[2:59:04.280 --> 2:59:07.600]  and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[2:59:07.600 --> 2:59:12.320]  I just received my male vitality about three days ago and I must say that good stuff.
[2:59:12.320 --> 2:59:16.680]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed
[2:59:16.680 --> 2:59:23.160]  what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[2:59:23.160 --> 2:59:28.720]  Super male vitality by InfoWarsLife is so powerful that I only take half the recommended
[2:59:28.720 --> 2:59:29.720]  dose.
[2:59:29.720 --> 2:59:31.920]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[2:59:31.920 --> 2:59:35.840]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality and get the day started.
[2:59:35.840 --> 2:59:37.800]  It's not just the super male vitality.
[2:59:37.800 --> 2:59:42.120]  All the products in InfoWarsLife.com are simply amazing.

[2:59:50.920 --> 2:59:54.520]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[2:59:54.520 --> 2:59:58.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[2:59:58.520 --> 3:00:10.680]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[3:00:10.680 --> 3:00:13.800]  If you want answers, well, so does he.
[3:00:13.800 --> 3:00:22.680]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[3:00:22.680 --> 3:00:27.840]  Carlos, thanks for holding for those two guests.
[3:00:27.840 --> 3:00:29.040]  In Texas, you're on the air.
[3:00:29.040 --> 3:00:30.040]  Thank you.
[3:00:30.040 --> 3:00:31.040]  Yeah, I'm here.
[3:00:31.040 --> 3:00:39.760]  I'm here in Houston, Texas, Alex, and I'd like to talk about Rex 84 and the open border.
[3:00:39.760 --> 3:00:44.640]  It's all coming back together, looking high, downloaded the internment and resettlement
[3:00:44.640 --> 3:00:45.640]  operation.
[3:00:45.640 --> 3:00:48.520]  Sorry, I'm just my adrenaline so pumping on everything's going on.
[3:00:48.520 --> 3:00:49.680]  No, no, exactly.
[3:00:49.680 --> 3:00:54.120]  We get close to things and then don't act like they're sensational because we're used
[3:00:54.120 --> 3:00:55.840]  to it even though it's sensational.
[3:00:55.840 --> 3:00:59.640]  It's good you're freaked out that you've got the resettlement people they're hiring
[3:00:59.640 --> 3:01:00.640]  and all just clicked.
[3:01:00.640 --> 3:01:03.800]  They've been hiring all those resettlement people for the U.S. They've been gearing up
[3:01:03.800 --> 3:01:06.680]  with all this stuff and then now they're imploding the borders.
[3:01:06.680 --> 3:01:07.680]  It is Rex 84.
[3:01:07.680 --> 3:01:08.680]  Go ahead.
[3:01:08.680 --> 3:01:09.680]  It really is.
[3:01:09.680 --> 3:01:16.000]  I mean, part of Rex 84 for people that don't know, I know you and I do, is to round up these
[3:01:16.000 --> 3:01:18.800]  people, detain them, and to be controlled by FEMA.
[3:01:18.800 --> 3:01:25.160]  Now, if you look back at our internment resettlement operation manual from February 2010 for the
[3:01:25.160 --> 3:01:28.640]  U.S. Army, it talks about this.
[3:01:28.640 --> 3:01:32.280]  It talks about they've planned this and they're imploring it.
[3:01:32.280 --> 3:01:39.280]  That's the rollout of the new National Police Force with a mission that's real that they
[3:01:39.280 --> 3:01:42.680]  caused to then be a permanent force who will then be for the general public, just like
[3:01:42.680 --> 3:01:45.280]  the article linked on DrudgeReport.com.
[3:01:45.280 --> 3:01:48.640]  We have the local news clip we're going to play when we come back in the next segment.
[3:01:48.640 --> 3:01:52.920]  Armed Homeland Security agents and community outreach to let people know they're in the
[3:01:52.920 --> 3:01:56.560]  area and to remind them to snitch on neighbors.
[3:01:56.560 --> 3:01:59.840]  I'm not kidding.
[3:01:59.840 --> 3:02:02.320]  So and I'm glad you got chills.
[3:02:02.320 --> 3:02:04.000]  I'm glad you're stammering.
[3:02:04.000 --> 3:02:05.760]  I'm glad you're freaked out.
[3:02:05.760 --> 3:02:12.600]  That's a normal response when you discovered an evil, premeditated plan that the Border
[3:02:12.600 --> 3:02:18.560]  Patrol, ICE, and Homeland Security won't even understand mid-level and low-level.
[3:02:18.560 --> 3:02:20.680]  We're here decompartmentalizing.
[3:02:20.680 --> 3:02:24.240]  But that's why they go, oh, there's no internment resettlement camp program.
[3:02:24.240 --> 3:02:25.240]  There's no Rex 84.
[3:02:25.240 --> 3:02:28.440]  There's no FEMA camp.
[3:02:28.440 --> 3:02:31.880]  That's why that Congressman told Jesse Ventura that, and Ventura goes, here's the bill.
[3:02:31.880 --> 3:02:40.280]  And he goes, oh, that bill, FM3-39.40, go read it, folks, for the American people, how
[3:02:40.280 --> 3:02:43.000]  to process our social security numbers, all of it.
[3:02:43.000 --> 3:02:45.280]  I'm going to do a special report on this tonight on the news.
[3:02:45.280 --> 3:02:47.200]  You guys print me that again.
[3:02:47.200 --> 3:02:48.840]  Anything else, Carlos?
[3:02:48.840 --> 3:02:56.720]  Well, people need to wake up because they're planning to crash the U.S. dollar in the Terminal
[3:02:56.720 --> 3:02:59.760]  Resettlement Manual at the back of PENIXJ.
[3:02:59.760 --> 3:03:08.960]  They talk about paying these detainees, civilian internment personnel in switch frames.
[3:03:08.960 --> 3:03:09.960]  It's in the manual.
[3:03:09.960 --> 3:03:14.440]  Like I said, if you go to Section J20, PENIXJ, it's in there.
[3:03:14.440 --> 3:03:15.680]  It's all coming together there.
[3:03:15.680 --> 3:03:17.760]  They plan when they implode the economy, absolutely.
[3:03:17.760 --> 3:03:23.680]  And it's social security numbers, how to process citizens, our social security cards.
[3:03:23.680 --> 3:03:27.760]  When we got this document, we broke this a few years ago, it took weeks for people to
[3:03:27.760 --> 3:03:28.760]  admit it was real.
[3:03:28.760 --> 3:03:29.760]  People are like, oh, it's not real.
[3:03:29.760 --> 3:03:31.520]  They finally had to admit it was real.
[3:03:31.520 --> 3:03:34.240]  Take it to work.
[3:03:34.240 --> 3:03:38.360]  And I leave it on the bar and I open it up and let my customers look at it.
[3:03:38.360 --> 3:03:43.200]  Now, look right here, HVD officers, read it right here.
[3:03:43.200 --> 3:03:44.200]  It's right here.
[3:03:44.200 --> 3:03:48.920]  And they're like, yeah, but that'll never happen what's happening now.
[3:03:48.920 --> 3:03:50.680]  And I appreciate everything you're doing.
[3:03:50.680 --> 3:03:56.360]  You know, the system is not broke, it's doing exactly what they designed it to do.
[3:03:56.360 --> 3:03:58.840]  And you know, people need to get ready.
[3:03:58.840 --> 3:03:59.840]  They really do.
[3:03:59.840 --> 3:04:04.000]  And I thank you so much, Alex, for everything you do.
[3:04:04.000 --> 3:04:05.000]  Thank you.
[3:04:05.000 --> 3:04:06.000]  I just love callers like that.
[3:04:06.000 --> 3:04:11.440]  And hearing his voice, his concern, his passion, he's trying to warn people.
[3:04:11.440 --> 3:04:15.120]  And the Houston cops are good guys on average.
[3:04:15.120 --> 3:04:18.160]  They're gonna go, okay, yeah, it's, but it'll never happen.
[3:04:18.160 --> 3:04:20.200]  Now they know it's nefarious.
[3:04:20.200 --> 3:04:22.200]  Now it won't just be the cover story.
[3:04:22.200 --> 3:04:26.040]  When the nuke goes off or the dollar dies and then, oh, well, we already have this set
[3:04:26.040 --> 3:04:27.040]  up for the illegals.
[3:04:27.040 --> 3:04:32.440]  You know, we'll just use it on you now.
[3:04:32.440 --> 3:04:33.440]  See?
[3:04:33.440 --> 3:04:38.600]  And they've got all the churches working for them.
[3:04:38.600 --> 3:04:39.600]  Makes me sick.
[3:04:39.600 --> 3:04:44.520]  We're gonna come back with Ted, Sarah, Steve, and Ronell.
[3:04:44.520 --> 3:04:45.520]  That'll be it for calls.
[3:04:45.520 --> 3:04:48.080]  And then I want to get to this clip.
[3:04:48.080 --> 3:04:53.240]  Home land security agents and community outreach to let people know they're in the area, beds
[3:04:53.240 --> 3:05:00.960]  out and forced to remind residents about the snitching program.
[3:05:00.960 --> 3:05:03.680]  Alex Jones here for info wars.com.
[3:05:03.680 --> 3:05:10.800]  In the month of July, we have got giant specials on everything at made in 1776.com.
[3:05:10.800 --> 3:05:15.640]  Already discounted made in 1776 t-shirts are only 1776.
[3:05:15.640 --> 3:05:19.840]  We have the new belt buckles that in only two weeks of sale are very close to selling
[3:05:19.840 --> 3:05:20.840]  out.
[3:05:20.840 --> 3:05:22.200]  There's only 500 of each.
[3:05:22.200 --> 3:05:26.400]  We're talking about made in America belt buckles and nickel brass.
[3:05:26.400 --> 3:05:28.720]  This is more than a summer blowout special.
[3:05:28.720 --> 3:05:31.800]  This is a new declaration of independence.
[3:05:31.800 --> 3:05:37.680]  But to expand the info war, we're offering the equivalent of more than five months free
[3:05:37.680 --> 3:05:38.680]  right now.
[3:05:38.680 --> 3:05:43.520]  And you get a membership at prisonplanet.tv for a limited time, only $39.95 a year.
[3:05:43.520 --> 3:05:47.400]  That's more than five months free off the regular price.
[3:05:47.400 --> 3:05:53.960]  Not just this July 4th weekend, but the entire month of July at madein1776.com.
[3:05:53.960 --> 3:06:04.480]  Molan Lombay, you can take my gun from my cold dead aunt.
[3:06:04.480 --> 3:06:09.880]  In the U.S., one in every 50 homes will have a break in this year.
[3:06:09.880 --> 3:06:11.960]  Burglars call it smash and grab.
[3:06:11.960 --> 3:06:13.860]  Burglars call it robbery.
[3:06:13.860 --> 3:06:15.760]  We call it avoidable.
[3:06:15.760 --> 3:06:21.880]  We are fake TV, a simple electronic device that can fool even professional burglars.

[3:08:24.440 --> 3:08:28.560]  If you are in Uptown Greenville today, you may have noticed the heavy police presence
[3:08:28.560 --> 3:08:30.120]  outside the bankruptcy court.
[3:08:30.120 --> 3:08:33.400]  We got several calls, so of course we checked it out.
[3:08:33.400 --> 3:08:37.720]  Several Homeland Security cars were stationed outside of the bankruptcy court and courthouse
[3:08:37.720 --> 3:08:40.320]  in Greenville, but not because there was a danger.
[3:08:40.320 --> 3:08:44.160]  Homeland Security officers till nine in your side, they were there as part of their community
[3:08:44.160 --> 3:08:45.160]  outreach.
[3:08:45.160 --> 3:08:49.760]  To let people know that they are in the area, they also were there to remind people that
[3:08:49.760 --> 3:08:54.600]  if they see something, say something, especially when they see anything suspicious happening
[3:08:54.600 --> 3:08:56.640]  outside of a federal building.
[3:08:56.640 --> 3:08:59.160]  Well, yes, I do see something.
[3:08:59.160 --> 3:09:03.880]  I see helicopter raids, armored vehicles, checkpoints, kids being trained to spy on
[3:09:03.880 --> 3:09:07.000]  their parents, parents being arrested because their nine-year-old daughter plays in the
[3:09:07.000 --> 3:09:12.440]  park across the street, totally legal, still they're in jail.
[3:09:12.440 --> 3:09:13.800]  I see total tyranny.
[3:09:13.800 --> 3:09:15.760]  I see the country collapsing.
[3:09:15.760 --> 3:09:17.800]  I see the borders wide open.
[3:09:17.800 --> 3:09:21.720]  I see the drug cartels kidnapping people all over the U.S. now.
[3:09:21.720 --> 3:09:27.720]  I see you purposefully wrecking the country so you can be the heroes that race in with
[3:09:27.720 --> 3:09:34.400]  martial law and permanent state of civil emergency to keep us all safe.
[3:09:34.400 --> 3:09:41.320]  I see you guys carrying out just continual, soft, false flags, because you know we'll
[3:09:41.320 --> 3:09:44.120]  catch you, you blow up another federal building.
[3:09:44.120 --> 3:09:46.160]  We know who did it, the names, everything, we have the eyewitnesses.
[3:09:46.160 --> 3:09:48.560]  You didn't kill enough of the cops that saw you.
[3:09:48.560 --> 3:09:50.920]  It got out, Don Browning and others ahead of the K9 unit.
[3:09:50.920 --> 3:09:51.920]  We know who you are.
[3:09:51.920 --> 3:09:55.160]  We got your hotel receipts all over its public.
[3:09:55.160 --> 3:09:56.160]  What are you going to do?
[3:09:56.160 --> 3:09:57.160]  It's been in the Salt Lake City Tribune.
[3:09:57.160 --> 3:09:58.160]  It's been in WorldNet Daily.
[3:09:58.160 --> 3:09:59.160]  It's growing in FortWars.com.
[3:09:59.160 --> 3:10:01.320]  Are you going to kill us all?
[3:10:01.320 --> 3:10:06.360]  We know who did it, where you planted everything, and you may not be convicted in court.
[3:10:06.360 --> 3:10:09.520]  You're convicted in front of everybody out there, and we know about the underwear bombing.
[3:10:09.520 --> 3:10:12.640]  You put in that drugged up Mutala bomb there by the CIA.
[3:10:12.640 --> 3:10:15.920]  We broke that, came out in Congress a month and a half later to roll out your naked body
[3:10:15.920 --> 3:10:16.920]  scanners.
[3:10:16.920 --> 3:10:21.600]  We know all about you running al-Qaeda, running the narcotics, and everything else, and you're
[3:10:21.600 --> 3:10:24.360]  not going to shut Jack's squad out.
[3:10:24.360 --> 3:10:25.360]  You understand?
[3:10:25.360 --> 3:10:29.000]  We have released the information, and now people know what to look for.
[3:10:29.000 --> 3:10:32.080]  So instead you're just, gee, we don't know why all these people are coming.
[3:10:32.080 --> 3:10:37.040]  Turns out you had a secret deal last year with Guatemala in Peach, Obama now, and a
[3:10:37.040 --> 3:10:38.880]  deal with Mexico.
[3:10:38.880 --> 3:10:42.280]  It's obviously industrial level, letting them on the trains that come up there.
[3:10:42.280 --> 3:10:47.520]  You try to hop a train and come up there from Guatemala over a thousand-plus miles.
[3:10:47.520 --> 3:10:49.400]  Do you know what they do?
[3:10:49.400 --> 3:10:53.400]  They knock your front teeth out and take you to a forced labor camp.
[3:10:53.400 --> 3:10:54.840]  New York Times reported on that.
[3:10:54.840 --> 3:10:57.320]  The shame of Mexico's immigration.
[3:10:57.320 --> 3:10:58.720]  Why, they're bad too.
[3:10:58.720 --> 3:11:04.400]  They have a border.
[3:11:04.400 --> 3:11:08.680]  And we went down and showed the border was open, and showed the big load on the buses
[3:11:08.680 --> 3:11:11.960]  because the ICE agent told us where to go to get it on tape.
[3:11:11.960 --> 3:11:16.640]  And you don't, you know the New York Times and CNN already knew all that.
[3:11:16.640 --> 3:11:19.920]  You know they all know it's the end of the border.
[3:11:19.920 --> 3:11:25.320]  Now again, even the average DHS cop or the average vertical person are good people.
[3:11:25.320 --> 3:11:28.280]  They really believe they're fighting al-Qaeda.
[3:11:28.280 --> 3:11:31.640]  They really went and signed up when they had family and stuff that died on 9-11.
[3:11:31.640 --> 3:11:34.080]  I know a lot of these people.
[3:11:34.080 --> 3:11:36.720]  I run into them and they go, listen, man, we're not bad.
[3:11:36.720 --> 3:11:37.720]  We didn't believe you.
[3:11:37.720 --> 3:11:38.720]  We thought you were nuts.
[3:11:38.720 --> 3:11:39.720]  Now we know it's true.
[3:11:39.720 --> 3:11:42.080]  This is scary.
[3:11:42.080 --> 3:11:44.200]  You hear them call in?
[3:11:44.200 --> 3:11:45.200]  You're right, it is scary.
[3:11:45.200 --> 3:11:46.200]  And guess what?
[3:11:46.200 --> 3:11:47.200]  We're all in this together.
[3:11:47.200 --> 3:11:49.880]  You think all your big shows of force and all this, you know, you're being ordered out
[3:11:49.880 --> 3:11:50.880]  there to do this?
[3:11:50.880 --> 3:11:55.880]  It's to acclimate everyone for federal police on the streets and military.
[3:11:55.880 --> 3:11:58.480]  We were sent video today that's going to be on the nightly news tonight.
[3:11:58.480 --> 3:12:03.200]  We don't have time to put it out now.
[3:12:03.200 --> 3:12:07.240]  Inside the military training to put black people in forced labor camps.
[3:12:07.240 --> 3:12:09.400]  Yeah, it's sensational.
[3:12:09.400 --> 3:12:21.000]  I don't know, I may have to get out of here because I keep, I mean, it's just getting
[3:12:21.000 --> 3:12:22.000]  too crazy.
[3:12:22.000 --> 3:12:26.560]  I mean, it's probably going to, they're going to say we're racist when we put this out because
[3:12:26.560 --> 3:12:27.560]  we don't have black people in camps.
[3:12:27.560 --> 3:12:30.400]  I mean, I'm telling you, folks, you don't want to chop black babies up.
[3:12:30.400 --> 3:12:31.400]  You're racist.
[3:12:31.400 --> 3:12:35.760]  I'm just so sick of it.
[3:12:35.760 --> 3:12:44.040]  I don't even know what to say at this point.
[3:12:44.040 --> 3:12:45.040]  I'm not complaining.
[3:12:45.040 --> 3:12:46.040]  I'm not whining.
[3:12:46.040 --> 3:12:52.720]  I'm just saying, I sometimes I just leave early now because it's just like, it's overwhelming.
[3:12:52.720 --> 3:12:58.760]  I mean, I can't sit up here and work till eight or nine at night if there's just always
[3:12:58.760 --> 3:12:59.760]  more.
[3:12:59.760 --> 3:13:01.240]  I can't even cover it all.
[3:13:01.240 --> 3:13:05.640]  It's just destroying the country where we live.
[3:13:05.640 --> 3:13:08.000]  We're all, my family's buried.
[3:13:08.000 --> 3:13:10.360]  They're going to come for our guns.
[3:13:10.360 --> 3:13:17.440]  They already are in California, New York, they already took them in Chicago, DC, Supreme
[3:13:17.440 --> 3:13:18.440]  Court ruled five years.
[3:13:18.440 --> 3:13:19.440]  They got to let people be armed.
[3:13:19.440 --> 3:13:28.240]  They're not letting people be armed because they don't care.
[3:13:28.240 --> 3:13:30.840]  And I can't break through the language barrier.
[3:13:30.840 --> 3:13:33.960]  I can't reach out to all these Latin Americans that are being used to do this, plus they
[3:13:33.960 --> 3:13:34.960]  wouldn't listen.
[3:13:34.960 --> 3:13:35.960]  They know it's true.
[3:13:35.960 --> 3:13:39.760]  They'll say, yeah, I know I'm being used, but I need to eat.
[3:13:39.760 --> 3:13:46.200]  See, the globalists know how to just throw crises at you that are real.
[3:13:46.200 --> 3:13:48.680]  They run Al Qaeda, but Al Qaeda is real.
[3:13:48.680 --> 3:13:50.760]  They run the collapsing border, but it's real.
[3:13:50.760 --> 3:13:51.760]  It's happening.
[3:13:51.760 --> 3:13:58.440]  The media is always, Alex Jones doesn't think 9-11 even happened.
[3:13:58.440 --> 3:14:00.440]  Never said that.
[3:14:00.440 --> 3:14:01.440]  No, no, no.
[3:14:01.440 --> 3:14:04.160]  The White House that teaches 2 plus 2 equals 5.
[3:14:04.160 --> 3:14:06.520]  Oh, no, 9-11 happened.
[3:14:06.520 --> 3:14:08.240]  They're a real Muslim terrorist.
[3:14:08.240 --> 3:14:11.080]  I don't know if they were involved in this, but they're real ones.
[3:14:11.080 --> 3:14:16.200]  I know the supposed hijackers were from Saudi Arabia, so we attacked Iraq.
[3:14:16.200 --> 3:14:19.880]  I know it's been used to take our freedom, and now we're told the Tea Party and veterans
[3:14:19.880 --> 3:14:21.960]  and gun owners are it.
[3:14:21.960 --> 3:14:28.120]  And every professional I tend to run into, lawyers and doctors and preachers, have been
[3:14:28.120 --> 3:14:33.000]  approached and been put into intelligence operations, and people, all of these movies
[3:14:33.000 --> 3:14:37.840]  and TV shows, all think it's like a status thing, like, that's right.
[3:14:37.840 --> 3:14:45.720]  I'm been recruited by the CIA here, and I'm the principal of the school at the high school,
[3:14:45.720 --> 3:14:50.480]  and I keep tabs on everyone just for the country's security.
[3:14:50.480 --> 3:14:55.200]  And it's the same thing with dentist and everybody, and these preachers, you know, these mega
[3:14:55.200 --> 3:14:58.080]  churches, and you go and talk to the preacher, and you go, so you're part of the clergy
[3:14:58.080 --> 3:14:59.080]  response operation.
[3:14:59.080 --> 3:15:01.080]  It's like, hey, how are you doing?
[3:15:01.080 --> 3:15:02.520]  I'll show you that funny guy.
[3:15:02.520 --> 3:15:03.520]  I got to go.
[3:15:03.520 --> 3:15:06.600]  And then they walk over and talk to one of the cops, staring at the door, looking at
[3:15:06.600 --> 3:15:07.600]  you.
[3:15:07.600 --> 3:15:11.520]  I mean, it's literally being put into a reeducation camp.
[3:15:11.520 --> 3:15:15.880]  I mean, you realize you're like in a body snatcher movie, folks, but it's our own species
[3:15:15.880 --> 3:15:16.880]  doing it to us.
[3:15:16.880 --> 3:15:24.960]  You realize you're dealing with actual accredited officers of a command takeover in an army.
[3:15:24.960 --> 3:15:27.760]  And I'm just some guy in Texas up here going, look at this, look at that.
[3:15:27.760 --> 3:15:31.000]  I mean, it's, we're wide open people.
[3:15:31.000 --> 3:15:32.600]  Do you understand?
[3:15:32.600 --> 3:15:36.200]  This isn't an intelligence takeover to build something pretty either.
[3:15:36.200 --> 3:15:42.320]  I'd be against it because it could be turned to evil later like the Ring of Mordor.
[3:15:42.320 --> 3:15:46.680]  You understand now?
[3:15:46.680 --> 3:15:50.420]  I hope you do.
[3:15:50.420 --> 3:15:54.520]  Because when they bring in this new system, they're not going to let anything of the old
[3:15:54.520 --> 3:15:55.520]  system be there.
[3:15:55.520 --> 3:16:03.400]  The old system has plenty of problems, but it's not evil from top to bottom.
[3:16:03.400 --> 3:16:06.640]  Everybody wants to conform and act like they're in the system and repeat.
[3:16:06.640 --> 3:16:12.240]  I must say everybody, large portions of people and think you're comfortable with status quo.
[3:16:12.240 --> 3:16:17.000]  And in most cultures that aren't evil status quo is good.
[3:16:17.000 --> 3:16:24.000]  No, no, status quo is flesh-heating bacteria killing hundreds of thousands of people a
[3:16:24.000 --> 3:16:33.680]  year and they're covering that up and other hospital infections status quo is total surveillance
[3:16:33.680 --> 3:16:38.560]  of everything you do by a criminal group that's doing it illegally and hasn't gotten in trouble
[3:16:38.560 --> 3:16:39.560]  for doing it.
[3:16:39.560 --> 3:16:40.560]  We're going to skip this network break.
[3:16:40.560 --> 3:16:41.560]  Ted in Nevada.
[3:16:41.560 --> 3:16:42.560]  Thanks for holding.
[3:16:42.560 --> 3:16:43.560]  I'm sorry.
[3:16:43.560 --> 3:16:44.560]  I'm ranting.
[3:16:44.560 --> 3:16:45.560]  Go ahead.
[3:16:45.560 --> 3:16:46.560]  Thank you so much for taking the call.
[3:16:46.560 --> 3:16:47.560]  I'm honored to talk to you.
[3:16:47.560 --> 3:16:48.560]  I'm a long time listener.
[3:16:48.560 --> 3:16:49.560]  I'm honored to talk to you, brother.
[3:16:49.560 --> 3:16:50.560]  Go ahead.
[3:16:50.560 --> 3:16:54.400]  I've been calling about the engineer drought we're having here in the West, but I've been
[3:16:54.400 --> 3:16:59.720]  kind of following it for a long time on pure next to the weather modifiers and every time
[3:16:59.720 --> 3:17:03.680]  a big specific storm comes in and they spray it and knock it down, Bellarmoll and the Gates
[3:17:03.680 --> 3:17:05.320]  Foundation finances it.
[3:17:05.320 --> 3:17:08.840]  They're paid by the government to do it and it's all public.
[3:17:08.840 --> 3:17:10.280]  There's a lot more I found out.
[3:17:10.280 --> 3:17:11.920]  It's called the pulse flow.
[3:17:11.920 --> 3:17:16.720]  They've basically been letting water out of the largest water reservoir in North America
[3:17:16.720 --> 3:17:21.920]  which is like me for like the last decade or so and they've got pictures from like helping
[3:17:21.920 --> 3:17:26.520]  them post in progress and all these like liberal nonprofits basically saying what they've
[3:17:26.520 --> 3:17:31.080]  been doing is there's an agreement between the US government and Mexican government where
[3:17:31.080 --> 3:17:34.880]  they're basically dumping water out into the ocean and it's all out there.
[3:17:34.880 --> 3:17:35.880]  It's all public.
[3:17:35.880 --> 3:17:36.880]  Oh yeah.
[3:17:36.880 --> 3:17:40.440]  And then if they can't dump it in the water like Klamath on the California-Oregon border,
[3:17:40.440 --> 3:17:45.560]  they will just put a fish that's invasive in and then say you can't have water for
[3:17:45.560 --> 3:17:49.200]  a decade because of the fish.
[3:17:49.200 --> 3:17:56.400]  I mean it's a siege operation but sir they're not just turning the lakes off or diverting
[3:17:56.400 --> 3:17:58.880]  them to the ocean and you're right that's on record.
[3:17:58.880 --> 3:18:05.360]  They are chem trailing and weather modification to knock out those storms before precipitation
[3:18:05.360 --> 3:18:10.760]  brings in and instead they dump it on the Midwest and cause floods.
[3:18:10.760 --> 3:18:16.960]  It's a geo-engineering program, the fact it's going on is declassified, details are classified.
[3:18:16.960 --> 3:18:20.120]  Five billion a year Department of Energy.
[3:18:20.120 --> 3:18:25.640]  We have huge file cabinets, I was going to make a film about it called Dark Skies Never
[3:18:25.640 --> 3:18:32.840]  Did It and there's like hundreds of patents on weather control from the 40s, 50s, 60s,
[3:18:32.840 --> 3:18:35.520]  70s, Stanford Research Institute Weather Control.
[3:18:35.520 --> 3:18:40.760]  They were controlling hurricanes, the Navy was, and I talked to the whistleblower, Fox
[3:18:40.760 --> 3:18:48.000]  News picked it up, in 1967 certified that they can create them, steer them, destroy them,
[3:18:48.000 --> 3:18:49.440]  make them stronger.
[3:18:49.440 --> 3:18:53.920]  But the general public just does not know that they're not in Kansas.
[3:18:53.920 --> 3:18:59.600]  We are in a science fiction movie right now.
[3:18:59.600 --> 3:19:04.560]  That's just pretty incredible seeing it firsthand but I spent a lot of time at the lake and
[3:19:04.560 --> 3:19:08.160]  just watching the water level drop like 40 or 50 feet and a lot of years.
[3:19:08.160 --> 3:19:11.880]  Well you're just not going to have that water, it's going to be dumped in the ocean, I appreciate
[3:19:11.880 --> 3:19:12.880]  your call.
[3:19:12.880 --> 3:19:16.160]  I mean look, the border's wide open, they're shutting down our power plants, they pay to
[3:19:16.160 --> 3:19:21.880]  ship our jobs overseas and then just give us fiat money and welfare just to get us dependent
[3:19:21.880 --> 3:19:28.360]  and get the robot cars and the robot troops and the robot factories ready.
[3:19:28.360 --> 3:19:31.480]  You know you think it's bad they got child labor in China and forced abortions, now they're
[3:19:31.480 --> 3:19:38.720]  just making the apples with the first of the new plants that don't have humans in them.
[3:19:38.720 --> 3:19:43.680]  Thank you Coller, thank you for bringing up that point.
[3:19:43.680 --> 3:19:49.920]  The public though generally doesn't care about just incredibly far out wild fantastical stuff
[3:19:49.920 --> 3:19:58.520]  like admitted geoengineering, manipulating the weather, to break the west, to get you
[3:19:58.520 --> 3:20:00.320]  off the land, to move into cities.
[3:20:00.320 --> 3:20:11.680]  Then they'll turn the water back on once they get it all, oh boy aren't they nice people.
[3:20:11.680 --> 3:20:15.280]  Sarah in Ohio, Sarah you're on the air, go ahead.
[3:20:15.280 --> 3:20:21.920]  Hi Alex, I'll take up too much of your time, I wanted to let you know about a fire that
[3:20:21.920 --> 3:20:28.040]  was handed out somewhere down in Cincinnati to my boyfriend that talks about one world
[3:20:28.040 --> 3:20:34.000]  government, in front of the fire has you know a picture of a globe on it and then it says
[3:20:34.000 --> 3:20:40.760]  a world government, why do we need one, is it possible and who is qualified to rule?
[3:20:40.760 --> 3:20:45.920]  And then it says here the answer is that a free public event, this is your invitation
[3:20:45.920 --> 3:20:50.160]  and it also says first new ruler, who really qualifies.
[3:20:50.160 --> 3:20:52.880]  Yeah that's a Jehovah's Witness fire I believe.
[3:20:52.880 --> 3:20:59.160]  That's right, that's what it's saying about that Jehovah's Witness is the one who sent
[3:20:59.160 --> 3:21:00.160]  this out.
[3:21:00.160 --> 3:21:08.880]  This was for a convention, a three day convention in Indianapolis that is free for people to
[3:21:08.880 --> 3:21:16.160]  talk about one world government, why do we need one and who it could be to rule?
[3:21:16.160 --> 3:21:21.560]  I don't know the details of that, I've seen those flyers and CJ says he's seen them but
[3:21:21.560 --> 3:21:26.440]  I would imagine that it's a way to get people there to talk about it and probably say it's
[3:21:26.440 --> 3:21:34.080]  going to be Antichrist but I don't know because I haven't followed that to its final conclusion.
[3:21:34.080 --> 3:21:37.320]  But world government's already here, it's a corporate government that's exempt from
[3:21:37.320 --> 3:21:42.600]  regulations and taxes and is above the law and they have a definition of that, it's called
[3:21:42.600 --> 3:21:43.600]  tyranny.
[3:21:43.600 --> 3:21:49.400]  It's the ultimate form of discrimination that Warren Buffett's the biggest recipient
[3:21:49.400 --> 3:21:55.520]  of banker bailout money is exempt in many cases and then lobbies for our taxes to be
[3:21:55.520 --> 3:21:56.520]  raised.
[3:21:56.520 --> 3:22:00.200]  I mean that's just outrageous.
[3:22:00.200 --> 3:22:01.200]  Thank you Sarah.
[3:22:01.200 --> 3:22:06.960]  Steve in FEMA Region 5, what former state are you in sir?
[3:22:06.960 --> 3:22:07.960]  Michigan.
[3:22:07.960 --> 3:22:08.960]  No.
[3:22:08.960 --> 3:22:09.960]  It's good to talk to you again Alex.
[3:22:09.960 --> 3:22:10.960]  Nice talk to you.
[3:22:10.960 --> 3:22:16.480]  Yeah I'm a Christian and a big problem in the church is that fellow believers in Jesus
[3:22:16.480 --> 3:22:21.920]  Christ don't know the real meaning of Romans 13 that describes a legitimate government
[3:22:21.920 --> 3:22:28.960]  that punishes the evildoers and when the government becomes the evildoers we have grounds to resist.
[3:22:28.960 --> 3:22:33.440]  Well that's true and the Declaration of Independence states that as well, it's just common sense
[3:22:33.440 --> 3:22:38.840]  but they've already got it set up with the 320 million people in this country to want
[3:22:38.840 --> 3:22:44.800]  a physical war that destroys the old police military order which is very corrupt but nothing
[3:22:44.800 --> 3:22:49.920]  compared to what they're bringing in to bring in the new computerized social worker command
[3:22:49.920 --> 3:22:59.880]  and control system on the ashes of the old ones so it won't do anything to you know go
[3:22:59.880 --> 3:23:03.680]  out and kill a bunch of police in military that would blow up in our face I'm not saying
[3:23:03.680 --> 3:23:10.960]  you're advocating that but if they march them out against the stage false flags and go after
[3:23:10.960 --> 3:23:15.640]  people the media and the culture has predicted programming it will it already shows the rebels
[3:23:15.640 --> 3:23:19.840]  and all these TV shows killing cops in military so people think that's what you go do to go
[3:23:19.840 --> 3:23:25.640]  resist no no you go after that and I'm not saying this I'm saying this is what you would
[3:23:25.640 --> 3:23:30.000]  if you were really wanting to resist them you go after the bureaucrats you go after the
[3:23:30.000 --> 3:23:36.640]  owners you go after the people running it you avoid the police and the military that's
[3:23:36.640 --> 3:23:40.120]  not the it's like in the video game where you don't want to shoot the women and children
[3:23:40.120 --> 3:23:46.960]  you want to go around those okay as much as you can you lose points you lose points when
[3:23:46.960 --> 3:23:50.280]  you go up against them plus you don't want to engage them anyways they're trained to
[3:23:50.280 --> 3:23:58.840]  fight okay you want to go after the brain bugs just like in movies like the standard
[3:23:58.840 --> 3:24:06.640]  study since the 50s at the army and navy and marine corps colleges starship troopers
[3:24:06.640 --> 3:24:12.680]  the actual book is much better than the film but the point is is that they go after the
[3:24:12.680 --> 3:24:18.240]  brain bug you want to be out there and you I mean do they try to go out once they figure
[3:24:18.240 --> 3:24:21.640]  out how to fight and just try to fight the little bugs the warrior bugs no no no they
[3:24:21.640 --> 3:24:28.720]  want to stay away from those and we'll go find the brain bug see what I'm saying yeah
[3:24:28.720 --> 3:24:35.360]  I mean I wasn't calling for violence if that's what you were thinking I don't know go ahead
[3:24:35.360 --> 3:24:40.280]  you know resisting in the info war and I mean I'm a believer in self-defense as well I own
[3:24:40.280 --> 3:24:46.440]  firearms and I mean if they do offensively attack us first I'm for resistant but but
[3:24:46.440 --> 3:24:52.120]  right now I'm for like a peaceful revolution like you talk about all this time absolutely
[3:24:52.120 --> 3:25:00.920]  where do you think it's all going well it's not looking good I mean I mean they could
[3:25:00.920 --> 3:25:05.840]  use the open borders the you know stage of false flag and you know blame it on whoever
[3:25:05.840 --> 3:25:10.480]  to take our liberties away some more I mean it's not looking good I mean I've been agreeing
[3:25:10.480 --> 3:25:15.880]  with most of what you're saying well they're using the wealth of the power of the west
[3:25:15.880 --> 3:25:19.600]  to build an empire while at the same time trying to destroy the west because it has
[3:25:19.600 --> 3:25:26.480]  ideals that have realized would overthrow their system and create a literal solar system
[3:25:26.480 --> 3:25:35.440]  and galaxy-wide renaissance just I mean what humans could do is just so awesome but the
[3:25:35.440 --> 3:25:37.920]  churches have told her by that we're not allowed to have that's the end of the world
[3:25:37.920 --> 3:25:43.440]  and all the rest of it so it's self-fulfilling prophecies it's very evil appreciate your
[3:25:43.440 --> 3:25:49.960]  call Steve Brent in FEMA region six I'm in FEMA region six former formerly Texas go
[3:25:49.960 --> 3:25:56.660]  ahead how are you today Alex I'm alright brother reason I'm calling man is this is really just
[3:25:56.660 --> 3:26:02.240]  getting me upset it's time for the fellow info warriors to put our money where our
[3:26:02.240 --> 3:26:07.320]  mouth is I make a little over $10 an hour and I'm a prison planet member and I know
[3:26:07.320 --> 3:26:12.680]  there are more people more well off than I am that don't have children to support that
[3:26:12.680 --> 3:26:17.160]  can afford to buy that prison planet membership let me say this brand I want you to drop your
[3:26:17.160 --> 3:26:22.960]  membership and call up tomorrow so we can give we're gonna start and I want to set up
[3:26:22.960 --> 3:26:27.480]  by tomorrow folks I figured how to do it we want to give memberships away because we've
[3:26:27.480 --> 3:26:32.160]  gotten better bandwidth we've gotten cheaper bandwidth we and it's important to fund this
[3:26:32.160 --> 3:26:37.680]  but absolutely I'm sick of it being people that don't have money supporting us I want
[3:26:37.680 --> 3:26:42.160]  the yuppies and the rich people I run into their listeners they should be buying family
[3:26:42.160 --> 3:26:46.680]  water filters from us they should be buying our food they should be buying all the supplements
[3:26:46.680 --> 3:26:53.320]  that are great anyways and they should belly up and really on a weekly basis buy stuff
[3:26:53.320 --> 3:26:57.880]  from infowars.com so that we can expand our operation and keep it going because I don't
[3:26:57.880 --> 3:27:03.040]  like hearing about people that have got families making $10 an hour paying $5.95 a month though
[3:27:03.040 --> 3:27:07.920]  11 people can use it though it's very affordable that's not my goal that's why as soon as we
[3:27:07.920 --> 3:27:11.960]  got better bandwidth and the cost has gone out across the board that's why the NSA can
[3:27:11.960 --> 3:27:16.840]  spy on everybody so cheaply now as well and save everything well it's it's with us bandwidth
[3:27:16.840 --> 3:27:25.840]  is cheaper the daily radio show video is free at infowars.com on the listen page so we would
[3:27:25.840 --> 3:27:32.560]  give everything away from free listen if some endowment came along where you know $89 million
[3:27:32.560 --> 3:27:35.520]  a year that's how much it takes to run this folks and that's that's cheap or something
[3:27:35.520 --> 3:27:41.720]  this big I mean if a billionaire endowment came by and just said here's the money I would
[3:27:41.720 --> 3:27:46.320]  stop advertising the issue is networks and radio stations have ads that would still be
[3:27:46.320 --> 3:27:51.840]  there but you wouldn't have me plugging stuff so I mean that's my goal I would like to not
[3:27:51.840 --> 3:27:57.080]  focus on money and so yes we can figure out how to advertise the fact to wealthy people
[3:27:57.080 --> 3:28:01.520]  and middle class people that hey you better do what the elite does with money they go
[3:28:01.520 --> 3:28:06.600]  and spend it to get what they want you better support real media you better support good
[3:28:06.600 --> 3:28:10.640]  candidates you better get active or lose everything is that what you're saying Brent
[3:28:10.640 --> 3:28:18.560]  sir I think also it's time for you the people that aren't as well off this time the lobby
[3:28:18.560 --> 3:28:24.360]  you know we have the power we have the money as the people and you know I have no problem
[3:28:24.360 --> 3:28:29.520]  paying that $5.95 for my membership it doesn't put me on the streets or make my kids any
[3:28:29.520 --> 3:28:34.760]  more hungry in fact I want to buy another membership just to give to another 11 people
[3:28:34.760 --> 3:28:43.320]  we're the we're the boys we're the lobbyists people got mad you know people with money
[3:28:43.320 --> 3:28:47.560]  are sitting here taking advantages of our advantage of all the free things offered
[3:28:47.560 --> 3:28:56.600]  it's time y'all step up to the plate even then about the issue based on facts that
[3:28:56.600 --> 3:29:00.840]  weren't trouble and put your brother brother brother you're so angry I think you're strangling
[3:29:00.840 --> 3:29:05.880]  your phone but God bless you look I'm out of time with Jeff in Utah Edward Edward and
[3:29:05.880 --> 3:29:11.040]  Jim I've got to go do other reports we got a bunch of breaking news it gives me a headache
[3:29:11.040 --> 3:29:16.240]  actually to realize because it's exciting once it goes on air and we warn people that's
[3:29:16.240 --> 3:29:23.240]  the fun part the going over at the research I got hours of that ahead of me and then personnel
