[01:07.080 --> 01:13.240]  as we finally got contacted by a huge huge guest there's very few guests there
[01:13.240 --> 01:16.440]  is big for this show as somebody like Jesse Ventura or Willie Nelson or and
[01:16.440 --> 01:20.600]  Charlie Sheen instantly Charlie is on Sunday night with us on the Sunday show
[01:20.600 --> 01:24.320]  I want to put that out right now he was sick Tuesday so he's coming on Sunday
[01:24.320 --> 01:31.800]  and he got better from the flu so that is coming up as well but the good news is
[01:31.800 --> 01:36.080]  I got contacted by this huge surprise guest last night and said how about
[01:36.080 --> 01:41.080]  tomorrow so the surprise guest in the third hour today believe me you don't
[01:41.080 --> 01:44.240]  want to miss that as well but out of the gates for the balance of the hour
[01:44.240 --> 01:48.080]  joining us from Minnesota is for Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura
[01:48.080 --> 01:53.120]  fresh off of hosting WWE Raw and bringing the new world order information to
[01:53.120 --> 02:01.880]  that governor great to have you how was your Thanksgiving sir it was great I
[02:01.880 --> 02:06.240]  spend it with my wife in laws and that's kind of a traditional thing every
[02:06.240 --> 02:10.720]  year my family's pretty much not too many of us left anymore and she has a much
[02:10.720 --> 02:15.720]  more extended family so I go over there and you let go like everybody you
[02:15.720 --> 02:23.480]  overeat a boy I picked out but you know I'm doing great well we're very excited
[02:23.480 --> 02:27.000]  to have you here and and we're just four five six days away from the premiere
[02:27.000 --> 02:31.200]  maybe we could squeeze a little bit more out of you about about the show that's
[02:31.200 --> 02:35.400]  really getting a lot of attention nationwide in newspapers well Alex I
[02:35.400 --> 02:40.280]  hope that it does you know we had a great article in the new or the LA Times and
[02:40.280 --> 02:44.760]  all that but people need to understand especially your listeners is that look
[02:44.760 --> 02:49.320]  the only way this show is going to stay on the air and the only way that we're
[02:49.320 --> 02:55.480]  going to get contracted to do more shows it's simple people ratings and if the
[02:55.480 --> 02:59.800]  ratings are there then they will they will buy us up again and we'll be able
[02:59.800 --> 03:04.920]  to go out and do more investigation be able to get stuff on TV and get things
[03:04.920 --> 03:08.880]  rolling more but if the ratings aren't there and we don't get bought up and so
[03:08.880 --> 03:13.480]  be it to the show that'll be the end of it so it gets to the point now where
[03:13.480 --> 03:18.360]  it's in the public hands and you know so the more people that watch the better
[03:18.360 --> 03:21.960]  chance we have of being able to investigate more stuff and get it out
[03:21.960 --> 03:26.840]  there well I was honored to be involved as a consultant and also to appear in
[03:26.840 --> 03:30.520]  some of the episodes and I just want to say I know you and I are both going to
[03:30.520 --> 03:34.800]  be surprised if it does there next week and the word is it is going to because
[03:34.800 --> 03:40.880]  this is really the fairest piece in mainstream television that I think
[03:40.880 --> 03:45.120]  anybody has ever seen so far this is trailblazing well let me let me put it
[03:45.120 --> 03:48.560]  in the context do though Alex so the people don't think this is not a
[03:48.560 --> 03:54.280]  documentary this is this is entertainment and we do it in a certain
[03:54.280 --> 04:00.280]  manner with a flow to it that we hope entertains people but likewise with the
[04:00.280 --> 04:04.840]  entertainment is a lot of valuable questions and valuable information and
[04:04.840 --> 04:10.520]  things that we're not getting answers to now can we solve them absolutely not
[04:10.520 --> 04:15.240]  like I've told the media on a one-hour TV show and when you don't have subpoena
[04:15.240 --> 04:20.000]  power and you don't have the ability to put anybody under oath you're certainly
[04:20.000 --> 04:24.840]  not going to fully answer every question that's out there and come to a
[04:24.840 --> 04:30.600]  good you know a certain conclusion but the questions now what this really show
[04:30.600 --> 04:36.000]  really does is it raises the questions out in the mainstream and that's what
[04:36.000 --> 04:41.720]  we need to have happen absolutely Governor Jesse Ventura is our guest next
[04:41.720 --> 04:47.400]  Wednesday it premieres on true TV 9 central 10 Eastern and you better believe
[04:47.400 --> 04:50.320]  I'm gonna be watching I hope all of our great listeners spread the word about
[04:50.320 --> 04:53.920]  this because from what I've seen of the episodes and I haven't seen them all I've
[04:53.920 --> 04:59.480]  just seen pieces of them this is gonna be groundbreaking we'll be right back have
[04:59.480 --> 05:03.840]  you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power if so this is
[05:03.840 --> 05:06.880]  going to be the most important message you will ever hear solar power

[09:09.160 --> 09:16.680]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[09:16.680 --> 09:24.000]  Alex Jones well he's with us for the rest of the hour we are live on Black
[09:24.000 --> 09:32.280]  Friday the 27th day of November 2009 his TV show premieres with huge buildup
[09:32.280 --> 09:38.160]  coming up this Wednesday evening December 3rd 10 p.m. Eastern 9 p.m. central
[09:38.160 --> 09:46.880]  governor Jesse Ventura joins us live today governor you are back hosting a
[09:46.880 --> 09:53.560]  WWE Raw and promoting the new TV show this is pretty exciting yeah it was a lot
[09:53.560 --> 09:59.200]  of fun Alex we did that Monday from Hershey Pennsylvania and not for me it
[09:59.200 --> 10:04.360]  was a I really put myself in the mental mode I thought you know this is kind of
[10:04.360 --> 10:09.560]  a chance to turn back the hands of time and go out there now fun and become who
[10:09.560 --> 10:14.960]  I used to be of course Jesse the body Ventura and so I really went into that
[10:14.960 --> 10:20.800]  mode that night than that because I didn't care I'm not a governor anymore
[10:20.800 --> 10:26.680]  so I don't represent a state so I can I can go perform like I used to perform in
[10:26.680 --> 10:31.200]  the heyday of wrestling back then and that's simply what I tried to do and I
[10:31.200 --> 10:35.400]  tried to have fun and so was a great chance to turn back the the hands of
[10:35.400 --> 10:40.160]  time a little bit and interact with some of the modern-day guys today and I'm
[10:40.160 --> 10:44.520]  amazed that there are so many sons of wrestlers who are wrestling now you know
[10:44.520 --> 10:49.120]  it's become a generational thing and actually Orton is a third generation
[10:49.120 --> 10:54.360]  I remember seeing his grandfather wrestle Wow again Governor Jesse Ventura
[10:54.360 --> 10:57.960]  joins us today in this exclusive interview before he starts the big media
[10:57.960 --> 11:02.800]  blitz next week we were talking there in the break and you are really surprised
[11:02.800 --> 11:06.000]  that it's going to air and it looks like it's going to air next Wednesday well I
[11:06.000 --> 11:11.160]  I always have the gentleman's bet with my crew Alex when we started the project I
[11:11.160 --> 11:15.840]  thought you know I think we'll do all the episodes and I think we'll complete
[11:15.840 --> 11:20.760]  our tasks but I I've always maintained that I believe that the 11th hour some
[11:20.760 --> 11:25.800]  you know high hand of whatever is going to come down from the heavens and and
[11:25.800 --> 11:31.160]  with the power to extinguish the show and give some feeble reason why it's not
[11:31.160 --> 11:36.920]  going on the air because I had that happen to me in my MSNBC show you know
[11:36.920 --> 11:41.240]  where it got right up to the time that we created the show we had it all ready
[11:41.240 --> 11:46.760]  to go they they were an intricate part of it every step of the way and then all
[11:46.760 --> 11:50.480]  of a sudden the date the week before we're supposed to go on five days a
[11:50.480 --> 11:55.400]  week the head guy comes in and says we're not putting this show on television
[11:55.400 --> 12:00.600]  and it turned out I learned through many people now it was my opposition to the
[12:00.600 --> 12:05.400]  Iraq war because I was one of the few people that was going to be very vocal
[12:05.400 --> 12:10.840]  and public and on TV opposing the invasion of Iraq and I still I opposed
[12:10.840 --> 12:15.320]  it then I oppose it today I don't care what the results are from it it was not
[12:15.320 --> 12:20.520]  the right thing to do in my opinion it was wrong and I was not led on the air
[12:20.520 --> 12:25.240]  because of that opinion if you think back there was nobody out there speaking
[12:25.240 --> 12:29.000]  out against the Iraq war before the invasion took place the only person
[12:29.000 --> 12:34.280]  who was was Bill Donahue and they yanked him off the air too you know Phil was on
[12:34.280 --> 12:39.080]  MSNBC that time he was their highest rated show and Alex you and I both know
[12:39.080 --> 12:46.160]  networks don't pull their highest rated shows unless they're owned NBC partly by
[12:46.160 --> 12:50.000]  General Electric one of the biggest defense contractors well not only that
[12:50.000 --> 12:56.920]  but MSNBC stands for Microsoft absolutely so but but you know at that
[12:56.920 --> 13:01.480]  aside I don't know who would do it there but somebody clearly had a political
[13:01.480 --> 13:05.920]  agenda that was coming down from on high that there there wasn't going to be any
[13:05.920 --> 13:10.480]  speak out against this invasion of Iraq that there you know the alternate side
[13:10.480 --> 13:14.760]  was not going to be heard I don't care people can be on both sides of that
[13:14.760 --> 13:19.600]  issue they're entitled to be that way but Alex we still needed to debate that
[13:19.600 --> 13:25.800]  never took place there was never ever a formal debate out there on whether we
[13:25.800 --> 13:30.920]  were going to invade Iraq or not and you know it was just in my opinion shelf
[13:30.920 --> 13:35.560]  down the throat to this country you think they approach you do you think they
[13:35.560 --> 13:39.240]  approached you knowing the war was coming up and they wanted to shut you up
[13:39.240 --> 13:43.920]  and and put those golden handcuffs on you knowing that your contract said you
[13:43.920 --> 13:48.560]  couldn't do any other media that was a setup no no I really don't I don't I
[13:48.560 --> 13:52.440]  think that they fought because I was a former Navy SEAL that I would
[13:52.440 --> 13:58.040]  automatically be a hawk that I would support any type of war effort because
[13:58.040 --> 14:03.000]  of my background and they don't realize that some of the most reluctant people
[14:03.000 --> 14:09.000]  to go to war usually are the veterans who have been there then my father was
[14:09.000 --> 14:14.200]  that way my father at seven bronze battle stars from World War two and he
[14:14.200 --> 14:19.320]  so vehemently opposed the Vietnam War I used to fight with him when I'd come
[14:19.320 --> 14:23.680]  home from school in high school because I was being caught we had to stop the
[14:23.680 --> 14:28.680]  domino effect of communism and my father said that's a bunch of crap he said
[14:28.680 --> 14:34.200]  it's people over there making money and he was right I was wrong you know I was
[14:34.200 --> 14:37.720]  being taught different but you were telling me about your dad you said
[14:37.720 --> 14:42.840]  the he was in Germany right blow up a bunch of tanks all my dad was more than
[14:42.840 --> 14:46.680]  Germany my dad was in the war before Normandy he fought Ramel on the North
[14:46.680 --> 14:51.480]  African Desert Wow then he came back and when it was in on the invasion of
[14:51.480 --> 14:57.960]  Normandy he had he had battle stars for North Africa Normandy battle of the
[14:57.960 --> 15:03.400]  bulge brabog and bridge and zeo and Berlin I know a lot of those veterans
[15:03.400 --> 15:08.840]  would never tell stories that's amazing hey let's spend a few minutes on your
[15:08.840 --> 15:12.960]  dad did he ever tell you about any of the battles no no my father was very
[15:12.960 --> 15:19.160]  quiet about like many veterans you know it's something they have that they
[15:19.160 --> 15:23.920]  keep inside them and I know he wouldn't he didn't talk much at all he only told
[15:23.920 --> 15:28.720]  funny stories he would tell me funny stuff that would happen like that well I
[15:28.720 --> 15:33.200]  guess they're not all funny he told me about the time that they had they had
[15:33.200 --> 15:37.960]  just taken cologne where the big cathedral was and he said some hot shot
[15:37.960 --> 15:42.880]  general came in and wanted his picture taken on the steps of the cathedral so
[15:42.880 --> 15:46.400]  they could send it back home so it looked like he led the charge and
[15:46.400 --> 15:52.000]  apparently they had include the city quite enough and some German sniper shot
[15:52.000 --> 15:57.520]  him right between the eyes when he was posing for the picture he did tell me
[15:57.520 --> 16:04.320]  that story which which from my father's perspective he used to always say he was
[16:04.320 --> 16:09.160]  an enlisted man and he used to always say always remember he goes patent and
[16:09.160 --> 16:14.360]  those guys wouldn't come in and tell a mosquito couldn't bite him so he would
[16:14.360 --> 16:18.400]  say that to me that they get all the credit for winning the war but he said
[16:18.400 --> 16:24.280]  it's the it's the it's the infantry man on the ground who truly wins it it's
[16:24.280 --> 16:28.320]  just that the generals and that stuff generally take the credit for it that
[16:28.320 --> 16:34.160]  was always my father's viewpoint on the situation and I tend to believe him you
[16:34.160 --> 16:37.600]  know I think he's telling the truth that you know generals don't usually come
[16:37.600 --> 16:43.400]  into it like my dad said a mosquito couldn't bite him well I'm sure your
[16:43.400 --> 16:45.400]  father is proud of you though and was proud of you
[16:45.400 --> 16:51.840]  oh yeah I think so I was proud of him too also use that I will tell you this
[16:51.840 --> 16:57.320]  little story about him Alex but I didn't learn until after he passed away he
[16:57.320 --> 17:01.640]  never drove a car and I found that strange growing up that I had a dad that
[17:01.640 --> 17:04.840]  didn't drive a car and whenever I asked him he just told me he didn't trust
[17:04.840 --> 17:09.200]  himself and I accepted that you know I thought well someone that doesn't trust
[17:09.200 --> 17:14.640]  himself driving certainly shouldn't do it because cars as we all know can be
[17:14.640 --> 17:20.080]  very dangerous things and then I learned after when my dad passed away from my
[17:20.080 --> 17:24.200]  mom that that wasn't the real reason the real reason was he was in the tank
[17:24.200 --> 17:29.000]  destroyers apparently many times he had to drive over bodies and he would
[17:29.000 --> 17:33.920]  suffer flashbacks from that if he ever got behind the wheel and so that's how
[17:33.920 --> 17:37.720]  he lived with it he never drove my father used to walk to work every day
[17:37.720 --> 17:42.520]  it was about two and a half miles well that's incredible one time I was deer
[17:42.520 --> 17:45.360]  hunting with all these old World War two vests my little kid and I kept asking
[17:45.360 --> 17:50.000]  to tell me stories and one of them Elmer Neville's turned to me and he was a
[17:50.000 --> 17:54.480]  tank destroyer in the bulge and he said okay kid you want a story and he said
[17:54.480 --> 17:59.800]  this beautiful bombshell blonde came up you know I'll never forget her red
[17:59.800 --> 18:03.320]  lipstick or blonde hair look like Marilyn Monroe and said she wanted help
[18:03.320 --> 18:06.440]  and then pulled out a pistol and tried to shoot us and we cut her in half
[18:06.440 --> 18:09.720]  there's your war story so I guess that's why those guys don't like to tell those
[18:09.720 --> 18:15.280]  stories probably you know I don't I you know who knows well you do you know if
[18:15.280 --> 18:21.040]  they're just things that remain private I think for people like that and the true
[18:21.040 --> 18:27.080]  hero doesn't brag about it the true hero does his job and you know and if you
[18:27.080 --> 18:32.080]  do your job many times just in the in the course of doing your job that is
[18:32.080 --> 18:38.560]  heroic and things happen that make you a hero but but ultimately ultimately is
[18:38.560 --> 18:43.360]  survival and doing your job so your dad was in some of the same it all gets
[18:43.360 --> 18:46.920]  down to nothing more nothing less so your dad was in some of the same battles
[18:46.920 --> 18:52.960]  it sounds like his Audi Murphy then I have no idea he was he was he was all
[18:52.960 --> 19:00.160]  over and kept this about my dad here's the other weird part he he found out he
[19:00.160 --> 19:07.200]  went in at age 36 well he could be he didn't get out till he was down here
[19:07.200 --> 19:13.800]  40 years old and was an enlisted man at age 36 and then we found out 20 years
[19:13.800 --> 19:18.200]  after the war that he had the wrong birthday and he was actually a year
[19:18.200 --> 19:23.200]  older than he thought he was so technically he would have never had
[19:23.200 --> 19:27.200]  to have gone and I used to tease him about it because that's what you know
[19:27.200 --> 19:31.920]  years and years later I go geez dad how does it feel to be a year older and what
[19:31.920 --> 19:35.240]  happened to that year in your life and imagine you've never had to go on to the
[19:35.240 --> 19:40.200]  war amazing let's come back and talk about vaccines being recalled in the
[19:40.200 --> 19:44.360]  news the H1N1 let's talk about climategate because one of the episodes

[24:19.440 --> 24:24.600]  it's fortuitous that we did come in live on this Black Friday edition Governor
[24:24.600 --> 24:29.720]  Jesse Ventura is our guest governor the banks are collapsing I want to get into
[24:29.720 --> 24:34.760]  that Dubai and deep water is ripples from debt crisis spread globally we're

[24:39.520 --> 24:47.160]  up at $1,200 right now but first let's get into vaccines I know you've had some
[24:47.160 --> 24:51.920]  personal family experience with that and and perhaps we'd like you share that
[24:51.920 --> 24:57.320]  with listeners if not that's fine but I have the headlines here out of the
[24:57.320 --> 25:02.000]  Toronto Star Associated Press Euro news faulty swine flu vaccine withdrawn in
[25:02.000 --> 25:07.160]  Canada after causing thousands of cases of bad reactions they're admitting in
[25:07.160 --> 25:11.360]  Europe that some of the vaccines have actually been killing people what's your
[25:11.360 --> 25:18.320]  take on this whole swine flu hysteria well I I haven't been vaccine and I
[25:18.320 --> 25:24.000]  won't be I I don't particularly go with that I don't know I'm kind of a weird
[25:24.000 --> 25:29.200]  case I remember when I did predator down in Mexico we were down on the set down
[25:29.200 --> 25:33.800]  there for eight to ten weeks and everybody on the set got sick except me
[25:33.800 --> 25:39.800]  and I asked the doctor I said you know when I was 19 years old I went to
[25:39.800 --> 25:44.560]  Southeast Asia for a nine month tour and then an eight month tour and I said
[25:44.560 --> 25:50.360]  whenever you derive over there within 48 hours you would get so sick that you'd
[25:50.360 --> 25:54.920]  be begging for death and then it would disappear and for the rest of the tour
[25:54.920 --> 25:59.760]  you were fine and I asked him this was years later in Mexico when everyone got
[25:59.760 --> 26:05.000]  sick including Arnold and I said doctor do you think that I've developed kind of
[26:05.000 --> 26:09.920]  an immunity and I told him my story and he said yeah probably most likely now
[26:09.920 --> 26:13.680]  who knows I might get the swine flu next week I don't know maybe that's the
[26:13.680 --> 26:18.920]  kiss of death for me but I don't get vaccines personally because I've really
[26:18.920 --> 26:22.560]  lost a lot of faith in government and my trust in government and what
[26:22.560 --> 26:29.080]  government does and so I and to me I that's just me personally and then so I
[26:29.080 --> 26:34.880]  won't get one and whatever other people do that's their decision to make but the
[26:34.880 --> 26:38.440]  government's been trying to push and order nurses and doctors to take it the
[26:38.440 --> 26:44.080]  AMA has come out now yeah no and I think that's outrageous I you know government
[26:44.080 --> 26:49.320]  telling you and forcing you to get vaccines to me is crazy it should be
[26:49.320 --> 26:54.200]  your choice if you have but then again if you get the choice is the wrong one
[26:54.200 --> 26:58.440]  then you're responsible see I'm a great believer in personal responsibility
[26:58.440 --> 27:03.920]  which means cutting government out of our lives and we accept responsibility for
[27:03.920 --> 27:08.040]  our own lives I read an AP interview and I've never even brought this up with you
[27:08.040 --> 27:12.640]  privately that you believe vaccines hurt somebody in your family yeah my
[27:12.640 --> 27:20.200]  my daughter was injured by vaccines but she's a rare case she was born with
[27:20.200 --> 27:25.280]  some problems and they had mandatory government vaccines that she was
[27:25.280 --> 27:31.440]  required by law to get before she could go to school and she got the she was
[27:31.440 --> 27:36.280]  seizure-free we had controlled them and then the moment she got the vaccine she
[27:36.280 --> 27:41.760]  went into a full grand ball seizure that night and the sad thing is is that you
[27:41.760 --> 27:47.720]  can never ever get any type of compensation for it because no doctor
[27:47.720 --> 27:53.400]  will get on the stand and say that the vaccine caused it absolutely plus they
[27:53.400 --> 27:57.640]  have a they always have the plausible denial so because I had another friend
[27:57.640 --> 28:01.880]  that had happened to their daughter and he tried to go to court on it and he had
[28:01.880 --> 28:05.760]  cost him thousands of dollars and he ultimately ended up losing because
[28:05.760 --> 28:10.520]  there's no doctor that'll get on the stand and and unequivocally state that
[28:10.520 --> 28:16.680]  the vaccine caused it well our cases where it does cause irreparable damage
[28:16.680 --> 28:22.080]  to people small minority groups of people and it's treated mostly like
[28:22.080 --> 28:28.440]  like collateral damage cannon fodder that oh well it's good for the big good of
[28:28.440 --> 28:34.320]  the big picture and most people if some people get hurt by it well so be it and
[28:34.320 --> 28:39.280]  I don't take that position Alex because to me that's like the death penalty if we
[28:39.280 --> 28:43.560]  put 50 if we put a hundred people to death that deserve to die and we're
[28:43.560 --> 28:49.040]  guilty but yet we kill one innocent person I think that my opinion is that's
[28:49.040 --> 28:53.760]  too big a price to pay for it I agree and once you set that precedent why not
[28:53.760 --> 28:59.040]  kill 10 innocent people so you can get one bad guy exactly that's a slippery
[28:59.040 --> 29:05.240]  slope that you go down and that's that's the bad thing so to me taking these
[29:05.240 --> 29:10.000]  vaccines has to be an individual decision they should not be ordered by any
[29:10.000 --> 29:14.480]  form of government or anything like that it should be up to you if you want to
[29:14.480 --> 29:18.560]  roll the dice and you want to take the chance you should have the right to do
[29:18.560 --> 29:23.400]  so absolutely governor Jesse Ventura is our guest we're gonna come back to a
[29:23.400 --> 29:27.760]  little bit more about vaccines and we're gonna get into climate gay not just the
[29:27.760 --> 29:32.120]  thousands of emails now the hacked documents which the police are admitting
[29:32.120 --> 29:37.000]  are accurate where they talked about fixing the climate models the computer
[29:37.000 --> 29:41.600]  programs in the code have instructions from the programmers how to carry out the
[29:41.600 --> 29:51.080]  fraud this is bringing down the man made global warming hoax we're on the March

[33:08.960 --> 33:12.880]  Governor Jesse Ventura with us a little bit into the next hour then we have a
[33:12.880 --> 33:17.520]  surprise guest now I'm sure you don't want to miss this coming up all right
[33:17.520 --> 33:21.200]  let's get into the serious subject of vaccines then get into the climate
[33:21.200 --> 33:26.800]  governor I happen to have bought over a hundred textbooks we have two rooms full
[33:26.800 --> 33:29.280]  of them here at the office but one of them was written by the white house
[33:29.280 --> 33:33.440]  science are who by the way is in these climate gate emails how they want to
[33:33.440 --> 33:38.080]  shut off everybody's resources shut off the west only the u.s and and and
[33:38.080 --> 33:41.840]  europe have to make cuts third world doesn't which will deindustrializes in
[33:41.840 --> 33:45.840]  here they talk about putting chemicals in the water to sterilize us in other
[33:45.840 --> 33:48.560]  government and un documents i have they talk about
[33:48.560 --> 33:52.160]  putting chemicals in the vaccines to cause autoimmune disease and sterilize
[33:52.160 --> 33:56.000]  people i've had brain surgeons like dr rustle blalock on who discovered that
[33:56.000 --> 33:59.680]  they know they're doing this by design and so
[33:59.680 --> 34:02.640]  your instinct to not take the vaccines is is good but
[34:02.640 --> 34:06.800]  take dale dudley local radio talk show host he took
[34:06.800 --> 34:11.680]  the regular seasonal flu shot his hands went paralyzed his feet went paralyzed
[34:11.680 --> 34:14.720]  he went into all these specialists and they admitted you've got
[34:14.720 --> 34:19.680]  gilliam beret or gian beret but it went away it normally goes away with people
[34:19.680 --> 34:23.840]  i mean this is some serious stuff and i know i'm in the population
[34:23.840 --> 34:27.200]  control uh... episode we talk about that
[34:27.200 --> 34:30.720]  in the upcoming tv show that premieres next wednesday
[34:30.720 --> 34:35.040]  uh... at nine o'clock central all across the united states but
[34:35.040 --> 34:38.000]  uh... i mean researching population reduction
[34:38.000 --> 34:41.680]  are talking to some of the i don't know if you want to say the name
[34:41.680 --> 34:45.280]  because i can i mean i could have interviewed him but i want to wait for the tv show
[34:45.280 --> 34:49.760]  uh... but you you guys got in touch with the insider whistleblower
[34:49.760 --> 34:53.680]  from morris strong's organization this is some powerful info what's your take on
[34:53.680 --> 34:56.960]  that well it's it's it i'll tell you alex it
[34:56.960 --> 35:00.560]  it it and you don't know what to take from it
[35:00.560 --> 35:04.880]  to be honest it's so repulsive when you hear it
[35:04.880 --> 35:08.800]  that you you just can't imagine that there are people out there with this
[35:08.800 --> 35:13.280]  type of thing on their agenda i guess that's the best way i can
[35:13.280 --> 35:17.600]  put it to you it becomes almost to where you
[35:17.600 --> 35:23.440]  you get to the point of unbelievable that human people could have on their
[35:23.440 --> 35:26.560]  agenda what some of these people have in the
[35:26.560 --> 35:33.920]  arrogance of them for having it well segwaying out of vaccines
[35:33.920 --> 35:37.920]  john p holdren is in these thousands of emails the white house science are three
[35:37.920 --> 35:41.920]  years ago when he was one of the head people at harvard
[35:41.920 --> 35:45.520]  on how to spin i don't know if you ran into him when you were at harvard
[35:45.520 --> 35:49.680]  on how to spin this and control this and cook the numbers and fake the data and
[35:49.680 --> 35:53.360]  oh my god the earth's getting colder the last few years how do we
[35:53.360 --> 35:57.040]  fix the numbers we've caught them red-handed lord mocton
[35:57.040 --> 36:01.280]  who i know you guys interview for the tv show he is calling for criminal
[36:01.280 --> 36:04.800]  indictments uh... senator inhoff is calling for criminal
[36:04.800 --> 36:09.440]  investigations here in the united states i mean to have the smoking gun it's one
[36:09.440 --> 36:12.080]  thing to catch al gore saying polar bears can't swim and
[36:12.080 --> 36:14.320]  saying we're all going to drown and it turns out
[36:14.320 --> 36:17.920]  that's disinformation he then just says he made a mistake but to have the
[36:17.920 --> 36:22.720]  internal emails from the main university that the un is citing the ipcc
[36:22.720 --> 36:25.440]  i mean to have this smoking gun what do you think should happen
[36:25.440 --> 36:29.440]  well certainly that you know if this is a fraud then
[36:29.440 --> 36:33.920]  then the fraud needs to be exposed and the proper things need to be done
[36:33.920 --> 36:37.280]  because i i was a believer you know i was told
[36:37.280 --> 36:40.400]  you know and and and it sounds very believable
[36:40.400 --> 36:43.600]  and all of us are against polluting you know
[36:43.600 --> 36:46.720]  i i don't think i think that's the common thing is that
[36:46.720 --> 36:50.400]  we all feel that there should be less pollution in the air and if we can get
[36:50.400 --> 36:54.080]  more miles to attack the gas those are good things
[36:54.080 --> 36:58.720]  we should work for those things we should work to use the sun we should
[36:58.720 --> 37:03.360]  find alternative energy those are all positive good things but
[37:03.360 --> 37:06.720]  then when i learn about something is being done
[37:06.720 --> 37:12.640]  to strictly to strictly manipulate and become a revenue
[37:12.640 --> 37:17.760]  getter to where it becomes a profit maker where they use something
[37:17.760 --> 37:20.800]  that might be a good thing but then they twist it
[37:20.800 --> 37:24.480]  and turn it into a massive profit making machine
[37:24.480 --> 37:29.680]  because along with controlling profits comes controlling people in power
[37:29.680 --> 37:35.680]  money and power go hand in hand absolutely when it turns to that level
[37:35.680 --> 37:40.720]  of money and power over something that you know we all agree on which we
[37:40.720 --> 37:43.680]  should pollute less we've only got one planet
[37:43.680 --> 37:49.600]  and it's a good idea to take care of it but uh but to allow it to then spin into
[37:49.600 --> 37:53.440]  being a huge money-making profit-earing thing
[37:53.440 --> 37:58.000]  beyond the good of it that's where you draw the line and say
[37:58.000 --> 38:01.920]  these people ought to go to jail for what they do well what about the fact that
[38:01.920 --> 38:05.600]  only the u.s england and europe have to make the cuts and so if carbon
[38:05.600 --> 38:08.960]  dioxide is so deadly of course plants breathe it but they're saying it's a
[38:08.960 --> 38:13.120]  listing it as a poison if you only cut it out in the west
[38:13.120 --> 38:17.120]  all the studies show that it will go to china and india and mexico and 160 other
[38:17.120 --> 38:19.840]  countries where they'll have zero emissions controls
[38:19.840 --> 38:24.640]  and actually more of these gases will be released well first of all laws are
[38:24.640 --> 38:27.680]  made and when you do things globally whether you do them
[38:27.680 --> 38:32.000]  globally whether you do them local county wise
[38:32.000 --> 38:39.040]  statewide national wide or anything laws should be equal
[38:39.040 --> 38:45.200]  so what i'm saying there is if we go to this global thing and they say these
[38:45.200 --> 38:48.640]  are the rules then the rules should apply to us
[38:48.640 --> 38:52.400]  the same as they do to china the same as they do to india
[38:52.400 --> 38:56.560]  the same as they do to every other country
[38:56.560 --> 39:02.240]  and if it doesn't do that simple thing then it's bs then you shouldn't go for
[39:02.240 --> 39:05.840]  it at all that's just common sense that's common sense
[39:05.840 --> 39:09.600]  it has to be equality across the board
[39:09.600 --> 39:14.960]  equal protection penalize one area while allowing another area to do it
[39:14.960 --> 39:18.400]  equal protection under the law governor that's what i that's what i like about
[39:18.400 --> 39:22.560]  you is that in your you know decades on the
[39:22.560 --> 39:27.120]  scene you have evolved you've changed you've learned you've admitted when you've
[39:27.120 --> 39:31.360]  been wrong you you most people
[39:31.360 --> 39:35.760]  in politics in society will not do that they will never admit that they have
[39:35.760 --> 39:39.680]  changed their views well you know you the only thing
[39:39.680 --> 39:44.320]  that changes views is knowledge and when you become knowledgeable on things
[39:44.320 --> 39:49.120]  that gives you the ability to change a view if you remain ignorant on the
[39:49.120 --> 39:53.200]  subject well then you're not going to change your view and there's no possibility
[39:53.200 --> 39:56.960]  of that happening alex one of the things that i was very honest
[39:56.960 --> 40:02.320]  about when i became governor i mean we have 24 commissioners that run 24
[40:02.320 --> 40:06.960]  separate departments of state government how can you possibly go out to the
[40:06.960 --> 40:11.920]  public and tell them that you're an expert all of those 24 fields
[40:11.920 --> 40:16.960]  you can't be alive and it's therefore you rely on experts in the field and
[40:16.960 --> 40:21.040]  that's to me is true leadership the ability to delegate
[40:21.040 --> 40:25.440]  authority to people you trust allow them to do their jobs
[40:25.440 --> 40:29.200]  if they shine you shine it's that simple
[40:29.200 --> 40:33.120]  if they do a great job for me when i'm governor
[40:33.120 --> 40:37.040]  even though i i don't take a direct hand in it it's his baby
[40:37.040 --> 40:42.560]  i still shine in the end that's a really good point is true leadership and
[40:42.560 --> 40:48.560]  management it certainly is uh this copenhagen denmark
[40:48.560 --> 40:52.000]  event is coming up in ban kai moon secretary general the un
[40:52.000 --> 40:56.720]  wrote an editorial titled we can do it where he said global government is here
[40:56.720 --> 41:00.560]  the key to world government is this planetary regime that will control all
[41:00.560 --> 41:03.920]  the nations and control resources and the carbon
[41:03.920 --> 41:09.600]  taxes the key then last week von rompy uh the
[41:09.600 --> 41:14.800]  new head of the european union and said this on the bbc
[41:14.800 --> 41:20.080]  we're going to play that clip right now here it is 2009 is also the first year
[41:20.080 --> 41:23.760]  of global governance with the establishment of the g20 in the middle
[41:23.760 --> 41:29.040]  of the financial crisis the climate conference in copenhagen
[41:29.040 --> 41:34.480]  is another step towards the global management of our planet
[41:34.480 --> 41:38.800]  our mission our presidency is one of hope
[41:38.800 --> 41:43.120]  supported by okay there you go uh governor how can they be announcing
[41:43.120 --> 41:47.040]  world government everywhere but then call us conspiracy theorist if we
[41:47.040 --> 41:51.680]  discuss the world government well again utterly ridiculous all you know
[41:51.680 --> 41:56.000]  there's a simple thing in a simple rule alex that i think everybody needs to
[41:56.000 --> 42:01.280]  uh reassess and that is always judge someone don't necessarily judge them
[42:01.280 --> 42:04.560]  by what they say judge them by what they do
[42:04.560 --> 42:08.640]  and when they're doing something you know no matter what they say
[42:08.640 --> 42:14.560]  judge by what they're doing and now the whole globalization thing i kind of
[42:14.560 --> 42:21.200]  view it like this in a way maybe it's inevitable alex
[42:21.200 --> 42:24.320]  but the problem is they let me finish though maybe
[42:24.320 --> 42:29.040]  because with our technology and the way if i believe in evolution i'm not one
[42:29.040 --> 42:33.200]  of these people that goes darwin's theory out the window and says
[42:33.200 --> 42:36.880]  i believe in evolution because i see it on a daily basis
[42:36.880 --> 42:41.360]  and i'm not saying i'm in support of the globalization of the planet but maybe
[42:41.360 --> 42:45.360]  it's evolution maybe through technology
[42:45.360 --> 42:51.280]  the world gets so small that we will eventually maybe not in our lifetime but
[42:51.280 --> 42:55.360]  a hundred years from now maybe that's the direction that it'll go
[42:55.360 --> 42:59.200]  and there's i don't know is there anything that can be done about it
[42:59.200 --> 43:02.400]  let me give you my take on this and i'm i'm honored to be able to give you my
[43:02.400 --> 43:08.320]  take as you influence a lot of people nationalism and sovereignty and borders
[43:08.320 --> 43:12.240]  give people a chance to flee tyranny and and also gives
[43:12.240 --> 43:15.520]  coalitions like the allies a chance to defeat hitler
[43:15.520 --> 43:19.200]  and musolini and the imperial japanese let's say we got a loving world
[43:19.200 --> 43:24.320]  government in place statistically it's an absolute certainty that over time
[43:24.320 --> 43:28.000]  a tyranny will take control of that global government
[43:28.000 --> 43:31.520]  but it's worse than that we know the group setting up world government
[43:31.520 --> 43:36.240]  are tyrannical are you genesis i mean i have the times of london headline
[43:36.240 --> 43:39.600]  worlds rich meet in secret to discuss
[43:39.600 --> 43:44.000]  overpopulation and how to depopulate we know that they don't want us as a
[43:44.000 --> 43:46.640]  people of the planet people the planet will want world government
[43:46.640 --> 43:50.240]  then that's their issue they've been building this in secret so we wouldn't
[43:50.240 --> 43:53.040]  have any input in it and it's not a hundred years
[43:53.040 --> 43:58.080]  we're beginning to go under this right now well you know and again
[43:58.080 --> 44:03.120]  i i i guess i don't like it alex but
[44:03.120 --> 44:08.160]  it because it does run that risk the big huge risk is
[44:08.160 --> 44:11.840]  what would the global government be and would it be a government you'd like
[44:11.840 --> 44:15.120]  and what would happen if it did become tyrannical
[44:15.120 --> 44:19.120]  which and you make great points that that borders are there so you can flee
[44:19.120 --> 44:22.800]  and have the sanctuary of it but then on the flip side though
[44:22.800 --> 44:26.560]  if you truly had a good global government wouldn't that reduce the
[44:26.560 --> 44:29.600]  chance of war that's how the globalists sold it
[44:29.600 --> 44:31.840]  but their internal documents have come out
[44:31.840 --> 44:34.960]  uh well i'm just saying from a layman's point of view
[44:34.960 --> 44:39.200]  if the if the global government were indeed good then let's say we you know
[44:39.200 --> 44:43.600]  say we're being utopic here pigs fly and we'll take the best thing we can and
[44:43.600 --> 44:47.680]  say that it's a a good global government well wouldn't
[44:47.680 --> 44:52.320]  the an elected all of that stuff well wouldn't that kind of help to eliminate
[44:52.320 --> 44:56.480]  war because now you got so much animosity with these borders
[44:56.480 --> 44:59.440]  and between countries and how often are they
[44:59.440 --> 45:03.280]  manipulated and turned against each other yes kill each other
[45:03.280 --> 45:07.280]  isn't war kind of a way to reduce the world population that's what they're
[45:07.280 --> 45:10.160]  doing that's what i'm saying the group setting up the world government wants
[45:10.160 --> 45:13.760]  it so big blocks of the government can make rules on countries and have a
[45:13.760 --> 45:16.400]  pretext to invade them what i'm saying is the global
[45:16.400 --> 45:19.680]  government's here and it's being set up by people that want to use it as a tool
[45:19.680 --> 45:22.400]  of empire that's all the world government is is a private
[45:22.400 --> 45:27.600]  corporate empire well then when then i can unequivocally tell you i oppose it
[45:27.600 --> 45:31.040]  good work and will work completely against it if that's the way if that's
[45:31.040 --> 45:35.760]  what it truly is turning into that is exactly what it is governor and it's
[45:35.760 --> 45:39.680]  and it's exciting to have you uh you know hearing the facts and saying you're
[45:39.680 --> 45:42.960]  going to oppose the global government and anytime i can brief you or give you
[45:42.960 --> 45:48.000]  any solid research or information i know you're a busy guy i would love to
[45:48.000 --> 45:52.560]  provide you original statements by the entire leadership
[45:52.560 --> 45:57.760]  of this group no problem i'll get them from you when i get back from surfing
[45:57.760 --> 46:00.640]  alex you haven't had a chance to go surfing yet
[46:00.640 --> 46:03.440]  have you i have not i you know i thought i'd be in
[46:03.440 --> 46:08.480]  mexico by now but you know what i my mental attitude was this i thought you
[46:08.480 --> 46:12.000]  know i'd rather stay up here get everything done
[46:12.000 --> 46:17.200]  get it finished lock stock and bill lock the door so that when i do go to
[46:17.200 --> 46:20.400]  mexico i don't have to come back till may or june
[46:20.400 --> 46:24.240]  well when i talked to you a few weeks ago you were not going to do raw
[46:24.240 --> 46:28.160]  uh because you wanted to go surfing but i guess you decided to do it well it came
[46:28.160 --> 46:33.760]  down to uh a certain things happened behind the scenes which were positive
[46:33.760 --> 46:37.120]  and uh it came down to promotion of the show
[46:37.120 --> 46:41.520]  you know it was such a powerful because you know raw is a very highly watched
[46:41.520 --> 46:44.880]  program in this country whether people will admit it or not rest tens of
[46:44.880 --> 46:48.720]  millions extremely popular and uh
[46:48.720 --> 46:52.960]  between the network and myself and and we felt that it was a very strong
[46:52.960 --> 46:57.600]  promotional tool that we should use to attempt to ensure the success of the
[46:57.600 --> 47:00.880]  show so i kind of swallowed my ego a little bit
[47:00.880 --> 47:05.680]  my personal feelings of our animosities that may have been lingering out there
[47:05.680 --> 47:09.200]  a little for the good of the show it's the old sacrifice you know
[47:09.200 --> 47:12.480]  you may have certain things that you don't like but for the good of the big
[47:12.480 --> 47:16.880]  picture you're willing to you know sacrifice for the success of it
[47:16.880 --> 47:21.040]  it's it call it compromising a little compromise doesn't mean you're a bad
[47:21.040 --> 47:23.280]  person well it certainly only helped the
[47:23.280 --> 47:25.920]  show so i think it's great but certainly you had a
[47:25.920 --> 47:30.080]  a rocky relationship with vince big man won a big lawsuit against him
[47:30.080 --> 47:33.440]  one of the few wrestlers ever successfully actually be paid retirement
[47:33.440 --> 47:37.600]  for your work and you know if people live long enough it's kind of good to
[47:37.600 --> 47:41.600]  become friends with your enemies again
[47:41.600 --> 47:44.960]  actually though i don't have an official retirement i have
[47:44.960 --> 47:49.200]  it's the result of the court case but i call it my wrestling retirement there
[47:49.200 --> 47:52.960]  is no retirement in wrestling but are you and vince friends now
[47:52.960 --> 47:57.840]  um i well i guess if you use the old cliche of
[47:57.840 --> 48:04.080]  keep your friends close but your enemies closer
[48:04.080 --> 48:09.520]  i would say he lies somewhere in between friend and enemy in the closeness
[48:09.520 --> 48:13.520]  well i tell you there's probably 50 million 60 million wrestling fans of
[48:13.520 --> 48:17.840]  that form of theater uh out there and uh to have you there
[48:17.840 --> 48:21.120]  educating them about the new world order that's only a win-win-win
[48:21.120 --> 48:27.440]  well it's it's you know it wrestling fans are a very loyal group of people
[48:27.440 --> 48:32.080]  they're a great group of people they take a lot of abuse because they like the
[48:32.080 --> 48:36.160]  sport but what what people need to understand is
[48:36.160 --> 48:40.320]  wrestling is like ballet with violence
[48:40.320 --> 48:46.080]  the performers are exceptional athletes it's a great form of entertainment i
[48:46.080 --> 48:50.400]  used to always tell people you know and when people go to the wrestling matches
[48:50.400 --> 48:54.480]  they they get so enthusiastic they leave it all there
[48:54.480 --> 48:57.920]  i would be willing to bet that when they go home at night
[48:57.920 --> 49:02.240]  there's never an act of violence committed because they're too damn tired
[49:02.240 --> 49:06.560]  well it is it is acrobats i mean i mean it's acrobat
[49:06.560 --> 49:11.840]  what it is it's very ad-lib people don't realize it's like live theater
[49:11.840 --> 49:15.520]  it's like looking at live theater as opposed to a movie
[49:15.520 --> 49:20.160]  when you do a movie if you screw up a shot they can shoot it 10 times until
[49:20.160 --> 49:26.400]  they're satisfied when you do live theater when you say the line it's gone
[49:26.400 --> 49:29.440]  you cannot bring it back let me ask you this question
[49:29.440 --> 49:33.040]  i do so much live radio but it's not theater it's information so that makes
[49:33.040 --> 49:35.840]  it easier but i've gotten so addicted to being
[49:35.840 --> 49:39.360]  live where i rarely mess up it's hard for me
[49:39.360 --> 49:42.800]  to do it when it's not live have you ever run into that
[49:42.800 --> 49:47.360]  uh no in fact i'll tell you the funny story i used to have a
[49:47.360 --> 49:52.320]  a personal like pride in myself that i would never use a teleprompter
[49:52.320 --> 49:57.920]  and i remember i used to say i can learn this i mean i can do this i'm talented
[49:57.920 --> 50:01.200]  and i was doing a miller light commercial where they have to be identically
[50:01.200 --> 50:04.480]  precise because the commercial is cut off by the computer
[50:04.480 --> 50:08.320]  so it has to be perfect and i remember i had done a few of them and then the
[50:08.320 --> 50:11.760]  director said jessie why don't you just try the teleprompter
[50:11.760 --> 50:15.680]  once and i used the teleprompter and i looked around i said
[50:15.680 --> 50:21.200]  don't ever let me not use one of these again absolutely i was so great and so
[50:21.200 --> 50:26.080]  there are cases where modern technology defeats
[50:26.080 --> 50:30.000]  oh no matter how pride gets in the way and all that stuff so
[50:30.000 --> 50:33.520]  you know it's one of those situations i want to throw the number out we're
[50:33.520 --> 50:37.360]  going to take a few calls directly for jessie vinter about the new tv show

[55:17.120 --> 55:21.280]  you know tweaks here and there what's the first episode next
[55:21.280 --> 55:24.080]  wednesday night that i don't know they've changed it a
[55:24.080 --> 55:28.560]  few times on me now so it's kind of like the chef's surprise even i don't know
[55:28.560 --> 55:33.360]  but you know what i i've seen them and i'm comfortable with them
[55:33.360 --> 55:38.400]  whichever one they air with because all seven of them are dynamic
[55:38.400 --> 55:41.360]  absolutely i don't i i don't have a problem now
[55:41.360 --> 55:45.680]  which one they open up with i don't care because i i feel confident about enough
[55:45.680 --> 55:48.400]  about all seven but give us an insight i mean are
[55:48.400 --> 55:51.440]  are they on the fence or one or two or what do you think's gonna air
[55:51.440 --> 55:55.680]  uh i i don't know if it's gone back and forth from my
[55:55.680 --> 56:00.320]  uh big brother and harp have seemed to have been the two that they wanted that
[56:00.320 --> 56:04.000]  they're battling back and forth with on the initial opening
[56:04.000 --> 56:07.600]  all right let's let's talk to matt in washington dc than eric and others matt
[56:07.600 --> 56:10.080]  you're on the air with governor jesse ventura
[56:10.080 --> 56:14.160]  hi mr ventura i have um i'm calling from maryland area
[56:14.160 --> 56:17.520]  and i was wondering if you had any words of advice for somebody a young person
[56:17.520 --> 56:21.360]  looking to get into politics into getting into the game and trying to do
[56:21.360 --> 56:26.160]  something online to what you've done well but you know it's a difficult thing
[56:26.160 --> 56:30.240]  because unless you the way our system set up today
[56:30.240 --> 56:35.200]  a young person seems to feel they gotta sell their soul to the democratic or
[56:35.200 --> 56:38.320]  republican parties and become part of that system
[56:38.320 --> 56:42.800]  and i really believe that's the problem you are those two parties because all
[56:42.800 --> 56:46.240]  they do is create career politicians and career
[56:46.240 --> 56:50.720]  politicians to me are the problem we have in our country our country was not
[56:50.720 --> 56:54.400]  founded for people to make the career out of getting elected
[56:54.400 --> 56:58.240]  yeah eric i would fight tyranny pick issues do the right thing work for a
[56:58.240 --> 57:01.920]  congressman you believe in uh but i wouldn't from the
[57:01.920 --> 57:05.440]  from the ground floor say you're doing this to get into politics
[57:05.440 --> 57:08.560]  because that'll probably never happen you need to probably go out and
[57:08.560 --> 57:12.720]  you know do something first substantive like jesse ventura or so many others
[57:12.720 --> 57:16.320]  and then uh but i mean let me tell you it's a nasty business
[57:16.320 --> 57:19.440]  let me have him know alex don't destroy the fact
[57:19.440 --> 57:23.920]  i would highly encourage you be active in a third party
[57:23.920 --> 57:29.920]  yes we need more we don't need pepsi and coke that's what we have right now
[57:29.920 --> 57:32.960]  two colors essentially the same as each other
[57:32.960 --> 57:36.720]  one slightly sweeter than the other depending on your taste buds
[57:36.720 --> 57:41.600]  there isn't no root beer there isn't no seven up there isn't no mountain two
[57:41.600 --> 57:45.440]  and believe me i put it in the soft drink context like if you went into
[57:45.440 --> 57:48.640]  context like if you went into the grocery store
[57:48.640 --> 57:52.960]  to good analogy and that's what we have now so i would tell you try to get
[57:52.960 --> 57:56.400]  involved in an independent movement an independent
[57:56.400 --> 58:00.480]  not democrat or republican very well said
[58:00.480 --> 58:04.880]  thank you man young people because the young people have the opportunity
[58:04.880 --> 58:09.760]  not for us old guys it's over the hill for us we'll still be there to fight but
[58:09.760 --> 58:12.960]  it's you young people that could create a third party
[58:12.960 --> 58:16.400]  and you could do it i have confidence in you i know it's there
[58:16.400 --> 58:20.640]  well i mean the left right paradigm soaks up everybody's energy and redirects it
[58:20.640 --> 58:25.040]  as a steam valve just get involved in defending the republic the second
[58:25.040 --> 58:28.400]  amendment exposing the phony environmentalist pick an issue
[58:28.400 --> 58:32.480]  and wake people up that's how you'll grow and learn
[58:32.480 --> 58:36.080]  how to be politically active from outside the controlled paradigm back in
[58:36.080 --> 58:41.520]  one minute with the final segment with governor jesse ventura

[1:00:52.120 --> 1:00:55.160]  I remember watching you on CNN the night
[1:00:55.160 --> 1:00:59.600]  you decided not to run for senator from the state of Minnesota.
[1:00:59.600 --> 1:01:03.040]  I think you and Ron Paul should be together.
[1:01:03.040 --> 1:01:06.680]  Third party, you vice president, Ron Paul president.
[1:01:06.680 --> 1:01:08.440]  And we can take back our appointment.
[1:01:08.440 --> 1:01:09.720]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[1:01:09.720 --> 1:01:12.680]  Why do I got to take second billing?
[1:01:12.680 --> 1:01:13.480]  Take first billing.
[1:01:13.480 --> 1:01:15.320]  Whatever you want, I want Governor Ventura.
[1:01:15.320 --> 1:01:18.920]  We just need you to bring back our republic.
[1:01:18.920 --> 1:01:21.480]  Let me answer that question quickly for you.
[1:01:21.480 --> 1:01:24.880]  And I use a stereotypical answer.
[1:01:24.880 --> 1:01:29.440]  There's a great song that Crosby Stills Nation Young did.
[1:01:29.440 --> 1:01:31.480]  And in the lyrics of that song, it
[1:01:31.480 --> 1:01:33.720]  said, if you want to get yourself elected,
[1:01:33.720 --> 1:01:36.360]  you would better cut your hair.
[1:01:36.360 --> 1:01:40.200]  Well, until you see me get a haircut, I'm not running.
[1:01:40.200 --> 1:01:42.400]  Now, as sad as that is, why should
[1:01:42.400 --> 1:01:44.560]  I have to cut my hair to run?
[1:01:44.560 --> 1:01:47.880]  So if we see you with a Mr. Clean haircut, look out.
[1:01:47.880 --> 1:01:52.160]  If you see me shave my head again, then watch out.
[1:01:52.160 --> 1:01:55.000]  But as long as my hair is hanging down at my shoulders,
[1:01:55.000 --> 1:01:58.680]  whatever little I got left, you can't run when you look that way.
[1:01:58.680 --> 1:01:59.080]  Why?
[1:01:59.080 --> 1:01:59.680]  I don't know.
[1:01:59.680 --> 1:02:01.720]  I'm still the same person.
[1:02:01.720 --> 1:02:03.480]  But it's all in perception.
[1:02:03.480 --> 1:02:04.360]  I don't know what it is.
[1:02:04.360 --> 1:02:06.800]  When you have the ponytail or a little bit of hair,
[1:02:06.800 --> 1:02:08.280]  it you don't look as intimidating as when
[1:02:08.280 --> 1:02:10.880]  you have the Mr. Clean.
[1:02:10.880 --> 1:02:12.920]  Well, put it this way, the Mr. Clean
[1:02:12.920 --> 1:02:14.920]  makes you get up and shave every day.
[1:02:14.920 --> 1:02:16.680]  And so it makes me more aggressive.
[1:02:19.760 --> 1:02:21.560]  All right, real fast.
[1:02:21.560 --> 1:02:24.720]  Steve in Texas, Steve, go ahead.
[1:02:24.720 --> 1:02:27.600]  Yeah, I have a comment for Mr. Venture and then
[1:02:27.600 --> 1:02:30.720]  a quick one for you, Alex.
[1:02:30.720 --> 1:02:34.400]  First, Jesse, I want to tell you that you
[1:02:34.400 --> 1:02:38.880]  were highly responsible for my awakening
[1:02:38.880 --> 1:02:41.360]  and me being able to reach other people
[1:02:41.360 --> 1:02:43.480]  because of your influence.
[1:02:43.480 --> 1:02:45.720]  And when I saw that you were going
[1:02:45.720 --> 1:02:48.920]  to have this show on conspiracies,
[1:02:48.920 --> 1:02:51.200]  I couldn't help but wonder, is this
[1:02:51.200 --> 1:02:54.120]  going to be watered down in any way,
[1:02:54.120 --> 1:02:57.280]  or is this going to be out there in your opinion?
[1:02:57.280 --> 1:02:59.760]  Look, I've got to let you go because we're almost out of time.
[1:02:59.760 --> 1:03:01.280]  Let me say this.
[1:03:01.280 --> 1:03:04.760]  It's not going to be watered down to the point
[1:03:04.760 --> 1:03:08.240]  where no one's telling us what to say.
[1:03:08.240 --> 1:03:10.760]  And no one's controlling any of the people
[1:03:10.760 --> 1:03:13.320]  we talk to and what they say.
[1:03:13.320 --> 1:03:17.880]  Now, do we find definitive answers to most of these?
[1:03:17.880 --> 1:03:20.880]  No, because as I said on the outset,
[1:03:20.880 --> 1:03:24.200]  we don't have the ability to subpoena anyone.
[1:03:24.200 --> 1:03:27.520]  We don't have the ability to put them under sworn oath
[1:03:27.520 --> 1:03:28.520]  and testimony.
[1:03:28.520 --> 1:03:29.720]  Well, let me throw this in.
[1:03:29.720 --> 1:03:30.920]  Let me get one of your.
[1:03:30.920 --> 1:03:33.160]  It's going to solve the problem.
[1:03:33.160 --> 1:03:36.200]  We're more a show that's going to raise the questions.
[1:03:36.200 --> 1:03:39.600]  And we certainly are not tap dancing around the questions.
[1:03:39.600 --> 1:03:41.080]  Yeah, folks, I've seen a lot of it.
[1:03:41.080 --> 1:03:42.800]  It's very hardcore.
[1:03:42.800 --> 1:03:45.840]  I'm surprised they're going to allow this to air.
[1:03:45.840 --> 1:03:47.760]  Who knows what can happen between now and next week
[1:03:47.760 --> 1:03:48.880]  or the other episodes there.
[1:03:48.880 --> 1:03:51.600]  But I just want to say what Jesse said before to me privately
[1:03:51.600 --> 1:03:53.920]  in the last 30 seconds, he can comment on it.
[1:03:53.920 --> 1:03:56.000]  And that is, they meant to make it fair,
[1:03:56.000 --> 1:03:57.560]  but the other side wouldn't talk to him.
[1:03:57.560 --> 1:04:00.280]  So this is really leaning way towards our side.
[1:04:00.280 --> 1:04:01.040]  Go ahead.
[1:04:01.040 --> 1:04:02.000]  Yeah, absolutely.
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:03.640]  Because when we started the show,
[1:04:03.640 --> 1:04:06.080]  we were going to show both sides of the conspiracies
[1:04:06.080 --> 1:04:08.080]  and allow you to make the choice.
[1:04:08.080 --> 1:04:10.880]  But when one side will not cooperate at all,
[1:04:10.880 --> 1:04:13.080]  which is that case of our government,
[1:04:13.080 --> 1:04:16.680]  well, then our shows now very much go on the side
[1:04:16.680 --> 1:04:18.720]  of posing the conspiracy.
[1:04:18.720 --> 1:04:22.040]  And you, in the end, will look at it and say, wow,
[1:04:22.040 --> 1:04:24.040]  who do I want to believe, the government,
[1:04:24.040 --> 1:04:25.960]  or do I want to believe the conspiracy?
[1:04:25.960 --> 1:04:29.080]  Because we're going to show you very compelling things
[1:04:29.080 --> 1:04:31.560]  that could quite make that decision if you're
[1:04:31.560 --> 1:04:34.720]  a skeptic, a hard one to make.
[1:04:34.720 --> 1:04:36.120]  Yeah, absolutely.
[1:04:36.120 --> 1:04:38.200]  A lot of this stuff's coming out mainstream news now.
[1:04:38.200 --> 1:04:39.920]  So the establishment can't hold it back.
[1:04:39.920 --> 1:04:41.600]  And Jesse Ventura is a big star.
[1:04:41.600 --> 1:04:43.360]  So it looks like they're going to let this happen.
[1:04:43.360 --> 1:04:44.640]  I am surprised.
[1:04:44.640 --> 1:04:48.120]  Governor, I guess I'll talk to you soon in the aftermath.
[1:04:48.120 --> 1:04:53.000]  And happy thanks giving to you and your listeners
[1:04:53.000 --> 1:04:55.000]  and have a great holiday in December.
[1:04:55.000 --> 1:04:57.640]  And I guess I'll see you all in the spring
[1:04:57.640 --> 1:05:01.000]  when I get back, if I survive the waves another year.
[1:05:01.000 --> 1:05:03.320]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny
[1:05:03.320 --> 1:05:05.080]  in the last century alone.
[1:05:05.080 --> 1:05:08.320]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[1:05:08.320 --> 1:05:10.640]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[1:05:10.640 --> 1:05:13.400]  they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[1:05:13.400 --> 1:05:15.520]  I've turned a tremendous influence
[1:05:15.520 --> 1:05:17.600]  on our president and Congress.
[1:05:17.600 --> 1:05:19.480]  And they really are calling the shots.
[1:05:19.480 --> 1:05:22.320]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[1:05:22.320 --> 1:05:24.640]  as American citizens to pay attention.
[1:05:24.640 --> 1:05:27.960]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation,
[1:05:27.960 --> 1:05:30.440]  the criminal offshore cartel, hell
[1:05:30.440 --> 1:05:33.280]  bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes
[1:05:33.280 --> 1:05:34.760]  constructing world government.
[1:05:34.760 --> 1:05:37.160]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[1:05:37.160 --> 1:05:38.720]  They're asking for more matches.
[1:05:38.720 --> 1:05:41.120]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[1:05:41.120 --> 1:05:43.280]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[1:05:43.280 --> 1:05:45.680]  And right now in Washington, DC, we
[1:05:45.680 --> 1:05:48.440]  have seen a fall of the Republic.
[1:05:48.440 --> 1:05:53.440]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.
[1:05:53.440 --> 1:05:56.640]  We're watching online right now in super high quality
[1:05:56.640 --> 1:05:59.560]  at prisonplanet.tv.
[1:05:59.560 --> 1:06:00.960]  Hey, folks, this is Alex Jones.
[1:06:00.960 --> 1:06:03.080]  And I want to tell you about Oxy Silver, the world's
[1:06:03.080 --> 1:06:06.040]  most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says
[1:06:06.040 --> 1:06:08.720]  can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[1:06:08.720 --> 1:06:10.480]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others
[1:06:10.480 --> 1:06:12.000]  urge vaccination avoidance.
[1:06:12.000 --> 1:06:14.720]  Instead, use vitamin Cd and Oxy Silver,
[1:06:14.720 --> 1:06:17.840]  along with Zeolife for broad spectrum detoxification.
[1:06:17.840 --> 1:06:19.920]  Using NASA science, Oxy Silver is
[1:06:19.920 --> 1:06:22.640]  nano silver covalently bonded to water.
[1:06:22.640 --> 1:06:25.280]  Oxy Silver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[1:06:25.280 --> 1:06:27.040]  Oxygenates for faster healing, then
[1:06:27.040 --> 1:06:31.000]  delivers a 528 Hertz frequency homeopathic-like energy.
[1:06:31.000 --> 1:06:33.600]  The Dr. Horowitz proves his fundamental to life
[1:06:33.600 --> 1:06:34.560]  in recovering health.
[1:06:34.560 --> 1:06:37.400]  He also recommends Zeolife for blood cleansing and GI
[1:06:37.400 --> 1:06:40.040]  Flora Pro as a probiotic for intestinal immunity.

[1:07:00.200 --> 1:07:03.160]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[1:07:03.160 --> 1:07:05.280]  If you're going into a battle and they give you
[1:07:05.280 --> 1:07:08.440]  a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[1:07:08.440 --> 1:07:11.960]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom
[1:07:11.960 --> 1:07:13.720]  and the lives of your loved ones.
[1:07:13.720 --> 1:07:15.520]  Food is your only ammunition.
[1:07:15.520 --> 1:07:16.760]  How much do you want?
[1:07:16.760 --> 1:07:17.800]  When do you want it?
[1:07:17.800 --> 1:07:19.760]  Now or after the battle starts.
[1:07:19.760 --> 1:07:20.800]  When will you need it?
[1:07:20.800 --> 1:07:23.040]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[1:07:23.040 --> 1:07:24.360]  Will there be any food?
[1:07:24.360 --> 1:07:25.840]  Will it make your children sick?
[1:07:25.840 --> 1:07:28.480]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself,
[1:07:28.480 --> 1:07:31.160]  will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[1:07:31.160 --> 1:07:32.960]  You wipe out all these problems
[1:07:32.960 --> 1:07:34.680]  if you have a good food supply.
[1:07:34.680 --> 1:07:37.640]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom
[1:07:37.640 --> 1:07:38.560]  and your life.
[1:07:38.560 --> 1:07:39.800]  How much will you need?
[1:07:39.800 --> 1:07:40.720]  We don't know.
[1:07:40.720 --> 1:07:41.760]  How much do you want?
[1:07:41.760 --> 1:07:42.720]  All you can get.
[1:07:42.720 --> 1:07:43.800]  I'm Alex Jones.
[1:07:43.800 --> 1:07:46.880]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[1:07:46.880 --> 1:07:51.160]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[1:07:51.160 --> 1:07:54.400]  Or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[1:07:54.400 --> 1:08:01.680]  Begin that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[1:08:01.680 --> 1:08:03.800]  From his Central Texas Command Center,
[1:08:03.800 --> 1:08:08.280]  deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[1:08:08.280 --> 1:08:12.640]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[1:08:12.640 --> 1:08:17.000]  He is a member of the European parliament.
[1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:20.680]  Nigel Farage, working on getting him on next week.
[1:08:20.680 --> 1:08:22.880]  And he's a nationalistic conservative.
[1:08:22.880 --> 1:08:26.360]  And he really tears them up for their criminal activity
[1:08:26.360 --> 1:08:27.160]  in the EU.
[1:08:27.160 --> 1:08:30.080]  He calls for its abolishment from within it.
[1:08:30.080 --> 1:08:32.760]  And so I want to play this clip of him just a few days ago,
[1:08:32.760 --> 1:08:36.360]  last Friday, grilling these people and exposing them.
[1:08:36.360 --> 1:08:38.760]  Then we're going to continue with the latest on Climate
[1:08:38.760 --> 1:08:41.640]  Gate, big, big developments there.
[1:08:41.640 --> 1:08:42.720]  And take your phone calls.
[1:08:42.720 --> 1:08:44.840]  And what's happening with Dubai and deep water
[1:08:44.840 --> 1:08:47.760]  is ripples from debt crisis spread.
[1:08:47.760 --> 1:08:49.720]  Gold at record highs right now.
[1:08:49.720 --> 1:08:58.600]  We do have a surprise guest for a full hour, for a full hour.
[1:08:58.600 --> 1:09:00.400]  Next hour, I'm just going to leave it at that.
[1:09:00.400 --> 1:09:04.920]  I am extremely excited about this, to say the least.
[1:09:04.920 --> 1:09:10.040]  But I have to practice my curtsy for this guest.
[1:09:14.680 --> 1:09:16.400]  Oh, man.
[1:09:16.400 --> 1:09:18.120]  So that is coming up.
[1:09:18.120 --> 1:09:19.840]  What drug me in here?
[1:09:19.840 --> 1:09:22.920]  Ventura called up.
[1:09:22.920 --> 1:09:23.720]  He is so nice.
[1:09:23.720 --> 1:09:25.840]  He gives me the first interview before a media blitz
[1:09:25.840 --> 1:09:28.000]  and said, I'll do it Friday.
[1:09:28.000 --> 1:09:30.040]  You want me to come on, promote the show?
[1:09:33.240 --> 1:09:37.040]  And then this other individual contacted us Wednesday night
[1:09:37.040 --> 1:09:38.040]  and said, I can do Friday.
[1:09:38.040 --> 1:09:38.720]  So I'm here.
[1:09:38.720 --> 1:09:41.800]  I was going to take off and take my children hiking.
[1:09:41.800 --> 1:09:44.040]  Man, the Austin Greenbelt, the Barton Creek Greenbelt,
[1:09:44.040 --> 1:09:45.200]  is like heaven right now.
[1:09:45.200 --> 1:09:49.320]  Two days ago, Wednesday afternoon, it was completely
[1:09:49.320 --> 1:09:52.400]  sunny, about 69 degrees.
[1:09:52.400 --> 1:09:55.000]  The water was like green, blue.
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:09:56.960]  You could see all the way down to the bottom.
[1:09:56.960 --> 1:09:59.080]  It was just so crystal clear.
[1:09:59.080 --> 1:10:01.560]  It was like something out of a Maxfield Parish painting
[1:10:01.560 --> 1:10:03.920]  or something with those oak trees and then the other trees
[1:10:03.920 --> 1:10:05.000]  turning colors.
[1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:08.960]  That's where I would like to be this entire weekend.
[1:10:08.960 --> 1:10:12.080]  Not gorging on turkey and red wine.
[1:10:12.080 --> 1:10:16.080]  But here we are.
[1:10:16.080 --> 1:10:17.240]  And I will be live Sunday.
[1:10:17.240 --> 1:10:20.720]  Charlie Sheen didn't feel well Tuesday.
[1:10:20.720 --> 1:10:22.440]  So we moved it.
[1:10:22.440 --> 1:10:24.360]  And so we're going to have the winter, 20
[1:10:24.360 --> 1:10:27.720]  months of the president on with us Sunday.
[1:10:27.720 --> 1:10:30.680]  If the water doesn't rise over Bear Creek, as they say.
[1:10:30.680 --> 1:10:33.760]  So this Sunday show will be live, 4 to 6 PM.
[1:10:33.760 --> 1:10:35.160]  So many good things are happening,
[1:10:35.160 --> 1:10:38.160]  like auditing the Fed, moving forward to the full house.
[1:10:38.160 --> 1:10:40.080]  This climate gate is so huge now.
[1:10:40.080 --> 1:10:42.880]  I mean, it calls for criminal arrest, indictments,
[1:10:42.880 --> 1:10:44.560]  people to resign.
[1:10:44.560 --> 1:10:46.920]  It's finally broken into the mainstream media.
[1:10:46.920 --> 1:10:48.080]  Incredible developments there.
[1:10:48.080 --> 1:10:51.400]  But let's go ahead and go out to break with a European Union
[1:10:51.400 --> 1:10:53.640]  member hailing from England.
[1:10:53.640 --> 1:10:55.320]  Nigel Farage, here it is.
[1:10:55.320 --> 1:11:01.960]  MUSIC
[1:11:01.960 --> 1:11:02.840]  Well, good morning, everybody.
[1:11:02.840 --> 1:11:04.440]  You're all very downbeat this morning.
[1:11:04.440 --> 1:11:06.720]  I thought this was going to be a big, proud moment.
[1:11:06.720 --> 1:11:10.480]  I mean, it's taken you eight and a half years of bullying,
[1:11:10.480 --> 1:11:14.000]  of lying, of ignoring democratic referendums.
[1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:15.720]  Eight and a half years it's taken you
[1:11:15.720 --> 1:11:17.160]  to get this treaty through.
[1:11:17.160 --> 1:11:19.760]  And on the 1st of December, you will have it.
[1:11:19.760 --> 1:11:21.680]  And of course, the architect of all of this,
[1:11:21.680 --> 1:11:25.240]  Jiska, wanted from this constitutional treaty
[1:11:25.240 --> 1:11:28.920]  for the European Union to have a big global voice.
[1:11:28.920 --> 1:11:31.000]  But I'm afraid the leaders have suffered
[1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:33.080]  from a collective loss of nerve.
[1:11:33.080 --> 1:11:35.120]  They've decided that they want their faces
[1:11:35.120 --> 1:11:37.440]  to be up on the global stage, not somebody
[1:11:37.440 --> 1:11:38.880]  from the European Union.
[1:11:38.880 --> 1:11:43.320]  And so we've got appointed a couple of political pygmies.
[1:11:43.320 --> 1:11:46.840]  The Kissinger question of who to call in Europe
[1:11:46.840 --> 1:11:48.640]  hasn't really been answered, has it?
[1:11:48.640 --> 1:11:51.360]  I guess the answer can only be Mr. Barroso,
[1:11:51.360 --> 1:11:53.800]  because he's the only one that anybody in the world
[1:11:53.800 --> 1:11:57.040]  has ever heard of, and is probably the big winner.
[1:11:57.040 --> 1:11:58.920]  Out of these posts, no wonder, sir,
[1:11:58.920 --> 1:12:02.640]  you look so happy this morning.
[1:12:02.640 --> 1:12:05.000]  And we have a new president of Europe.
[1:12:05.000 --> 1:12:07.120]  Herman Van Rompuy.
[1:12:07.120 --> 1:12:09.720]  Doesn't exactly trip off the tongue, does it?
[1:12:09.720 --> 1:12:14.680]  I can't see him stopping the traffic in Beijing or Washington.
[1:12:14.680 --> 1:12:19.040]  I doubt anybody in Brussels would even recognize who he is.
[1:12:19.040 --> 1:12:21.720]  And yet, he's going to be paid a salary that
[1:12:21.720 --> 1:12:24.560]  is bigger than Obama's, which tells you all
[1:12:24.560 --> 1:12:27.480]  you need to know about this European political class
[1:12:27.480 --> 1:12:30.120]  and how they look after themselves.
[1:12:30.120 --> 1:12:32.160]  But at least he's an elected politician,
[1:12:32.160 --> 1:12:35.640]  unlike Baroness Cathy Ashton, who really
[1:12:35.640 --> 1:12:39.400]  is the true representation of the modern day political class.
[1:12:39.400 --> 1:12:41.520]  In some way, she's ideal, isn't she?
[1:12:41.520 --> 1:12:43.720]  She's never had a proper job, and she's never
[1:12:43.720 --> 1:12:46.200]  been elected to anything in her life.
[1:12:46.200 --> 1:12:48.840]  So I guess she's perfect for this European Union.
[1:12:48.840 --> 1:12:50.680]  Excuse me, Mr. Farage.
[1:12:50.680 --> 1:12:53.760]  I would like to put down your postage.
[1:12:53.760 --> 1:12:57.720]  You made your presentation is enough for us.
[1:12:57.720 --> 1:13:00.000]  OK, please continue.
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:03.240]  I can't know, but I mean, she's never been elected to anything,
[1:13:03.240 --> 1:13:04.920]  and no one knows who she is.
[1:13:04.920 --> 1:13:08.840]  Even the prime minister was talking about Baroness Ashdown
[1:13:08.840 --> 1:13:10.160]  as opposed to Ashton.
[1:13:10.160 --> 1:13:12.720]  I mean, no one has ever heard of her.
[1:13:12.720 --> 1:13:16.160]  She's even less well known than Herman Van Rompuy.
[1:13:16.160 --> 1:13:18.680]  I mean, that takes some doing, doesn't it?
[1:13:18.680 --> 1:13:20.200]  She's risen without trace.
[1:13:20.200 --> 1:13:22.960]  She's part of this post-democratic age.
[1:13:22.960 --> 1:13:24.360]  She married well.
[1:13:24.360 --> 1:13:27.600]  She married an advisor and a friend and supporter
[1:13:27.600 --> 1:13:30.520]  of Tony Blair and got put in the House of Lords.
[1:13:30.520 --> 1:13:32.160]  When she was in the House of Lords,
[1:13:32.160 --> 1:13:34.920]  she was given one big job, and the job
[1:13:34.920 --> 1:13:37.960]  was to get the Lisbon treaty through the House of Lords
[1:13:37.960 --> 1:13:43.640]  and to do so pretending that it was entirely different
[1:13:43.640 --> 1:13:45.080]  to the EU Constitution.
[1:13:45.080 --> 1:13:47.560]  So she's good at keeping a straight face,
[1:13:47.560 --> 1:13:51.400]  and she vigorously crushed any attempt in the House of Lords
[1:13:51.400 --> 1:13:53.720]  for the British people to have a referendum.
[1:13:53.720 --> 1:13:57.960]  So here she is, never stood for public office, never
[1:13:57.960 --> 1:14:00.920]  had a proper job, and here she gets one of the top jobs
[1:14:00.920 --> 1:14:01.880]  in the union.
[1:14:01.880 --> 1:14:05.560]  Her appointment is an embarrassment for Britain.
[1:14:05.560 --> 1:14:06.760]  But it's much worse.
[1:14:06.760 --> 1:14:08.360]  Well, at least I've been elected, sir.
[1:14:08.360 --> 1:14:10.480]  Unlike her, she's not been elected,
[1:14:10.480 --> 1:14:13.000]  and the people don't have the power to remove her.
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:14.520]  But just hear the next bit.
[1:14:14.520 --> 1:14:17.240]  There's something rather more serious than that.
[1:14:17.240 --> 1:14:20.480]  Kathy Ashdown was an active member
[1:14:20.480 --> 1:14:23.440]  of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament.
[1:14:23.440 --> 1:14:26.720]  In fact, she was the treasurer of the Campaign
[1:14:26.720 --> 1:14:30.120]  for Nuclear Disarmament during a period of time
[1:14:30.120 --> 1:14:34.360]  when CND took very large donations
[1:14:34.360 --> 1:14:37.080]  and refused to reveal the source.
[1:14:37.080 --> 1:14:39.400]  What is known is that these donations
[1:14:39.400 --> 1:14:42.480]  were obtained by a man called Will Howard, who
[1:14:42.480 --> 1:14:46.040]  was a member of the Communist Party in Great Britain.
[1:14:46.040 --> 1:14:50.320]  Will Baroness Ashdown deny that, while she was treasurer,
[1:14:50.320 --> 1:14:53.440]  that she took funds from organizations
[1:14:53.440 --> 1:14:57.440]  who were opposed to Western-style capitalism and democracy?
[1:14:57.440 --> 1:14:59.560]  That question must be asked.
[1:14:59.560 --> 1:15:02.560]  And are we really happy that somebody
[1:15:02.560 --> 1:15:06.520]  who will be in charge of our overseas security policy
[1:15:06.520 --> 1:15:10.400]  was an activist a few years ago in an outfit like CND?
[1:15:10.400 --> 1:15:12.880]  I mean, if we really think that, frankly,
[1:15:12.880 --> 1:15:14.920]  we need our bumps fell.
[1:15:14.920 --> 1:15:17.440]  I don't think that she's a fit and proper person
[1:15:17.440 --> 1:15:18.440]  to do this job.
[1:15:18.440 --> 1:15:19.840]  She has no experience.
[1:15:19.840 --> 1:15:21.760]  And unless she can answer those questions,
[1:15:21.760 --> 1:15:24.720]  did she take money from enemies of the West?
[1:15:24.720 --> 1:15:27.040]  That question must be answered.
[1:15:27.040 --> 1:15:29.040]  Well, we have our two pygmies.
[1:15:29.040 --> 1:15:31.360]  We'll have the bland leading the bland.
[1:15:31.360 --> 1:15:33.240]  But I'm not celebrating because they'll
[1:15:33.240 --> 1:15:35.520]  press on with political union.
[1:15:35.520 --> 1:15:38.680]  And whilst our leaders may have saved face for the moment
[1:15:38.680 --> 1:15:41.040]  for themselves on the international stage,
[1:15:41.040 --> 1:15:43.920]  they have all betrayed their national democracies.
[1:15:43.920 --> 1:15:46.480]  The European state is here.
[1:15:46.480 --> 1:15:49.200]  We're about to get an avalanche of new laws
[1:15:49.200 --> 1:15:51.200]  because of this Lisbon Treaty.
[1:15:51.200 --> 1:15:53.200]  And there's no question in my mind
[1:15:53.200 --> 1:15:56.920]  that there has to be a full, free, fair referendum
[1:15:56.920 --> 1:15:58.920]  in the United Kingdom to decide whether we
[1:15:58.920 --> 1:16:01.400]  stay part of this union or not.
[1:16:01.400 --> 1:16:03.760]  I hope and pray that we vote to leave.
[1:16:03.760 --> 1:16:06.600]  But either way, the people simply must be asked.
[1:16:06.600 --> 1:16:07.600]  Thank you.
[1:16:07.600 --> 1:16:34.240]  I would like to turn to Mr Farage.
[1:16:34.240 --> 1:16:39.320]  It would be most appropriate if you turned your tone down
[1:16:39.320 --> 1:16:44.160]  because certain expressions are not acceptable to everybody.
[1:16:44.160 --> 1:16:46.360]  I would like to ask you whether you would
[1:16:46.360 --> 1:16:52.280]  like to accept a question from some of the members
[1:16:52.280 --> 1:16:54.160]  as the blue card question.
[1:16:54.160 --> 1:16:55.160]  But I'm just curious.
[1:16:55.160 --> 1:16:56.160]  Madame Herzog.
[1:16:56.160 --> 1:16:57.160]  I'm just curious.
[1:16:57.160 --> 1:16:58.160]  Please.
[1:16:58.160 --> 1:17:07.840]  Well, maybe Madame Herzog, please.
[1:17:07.840 --> 1:17:12.240]  Mr President, Mr Farage has said that those people
[1:17:12.240 --> 1:17:14.560]  they were elected last week are not those
[1:17:14.560 --> 1:17:17.560]  the traffic will stop to let them go.
[1:17:17.560 --> 1:17:19.520]  And this is why we elected them because we
[1:17:19.520 --> 1:17:23.240]  wanted to elect people who will make the traffic move
[1:17:23.240 --> 1:17:26.720]  for all European citizens to get a better life to themselves.
[1:17:26.720 --> 1:17:28.160]  And this is what they will do.
[1:17:28.160 --> 1:17:31.760]  Mr Rompuy and Mr Cathy Ashton are four people
[1:17:31.760 --> 1:17:36.240]  and the 480 million European will know it soon.
[1:17:36.240 --> 1:17:37.800]  I think this is the stake.
[1:17:37.800 --> 1:17:39.120]  We have to stand for them.
[1:17:39.120 --> 1:17:43.640]  We have to save their integrity, personal integrity.
[1:17:43.640 --> 1:17:46.240]  And Mr Farage, I'd like to say something,
[1:17:46.240 --> 1:17:47.920]  Hungarian quotation for you.
[1:17:47.920 --> 1:17:50.600]  It's good that you are here because if the monkey goes up
[1:17:50.600 --> 1:17:59.400]  to the tree, it's better seen how dead is his pope.
[1:17:59.400 --> 1:18:00.400]  All right.
[1:18:00.400 --> 1:18:01.400]  Thank you.
[1:18:01.400 --> 1:18:03.360]  Now, it goes on and on.
[1:18:03.360 --> 1:18:04.520]  There's hours of this.
[1:18:04.520 --> 1:18:07.760]  That's Nigel Farage, the British member of the European
[1:18:07.760 --> 1:18:10.000]  Parliament.
[1:18:10.000 --> 1:18:14.120]  And he's not allowed to criticize people, but the minister
[1:18:14.120 --> 1:18:17.600]  from Poland is allowed to say when a monkey goes up the tree,
[1:18:17.600 --> 1:18:20.560]  farther and further, the more we can see his butt.
[1:18:20.560 --> 1:18:25.240]  So she can engage in preschool sayings and they don't reprimand
[1:18:25.240 --> 1:18:28.520]  her than others attacking throughout the day and then they
[1:18:28.520 --> 1:18:32.160]  just turn his microphone off and let them all calling names.
[1:18:32.160 --> 1:18:34.400]  And then they reprimanded him and said, you're not allowed
[1:18:34.400 --> 1:18:37.120]  to speak anymore because of what you said.
[1:18:37.120 --> 1:18:39.000]  We don't like it.
[1:18:39.000 --> 1:18:42.600]  This is a dictatorial, unelected group of crooks that run the
[1:18:42.600 --> 1:18:44.280]  central committee over the EU.
[1:18:44.280 --> 1:18:47.400]  There's two different bodies and the nation states can't even
[1:18:47.400 --> 1:18:48.400]  get out of it.
[1:18:48.400 --> 1:18:50.080]  France voted to get out of it.
[1:18:50.080 --> 1:18:52.880]  Other countries voted.
[1:18:52.880 --> 1:18:54.880]  Ireland voted to not be part of it.
[1:18:54.880 --> 1:18:56.200]  They just wanted to have another vote.
[1:18:56.200 --> 1:18:58.800]  And obviously there's a lot of evidence of election fraud
[1:18:58.800 --> 1:19:01.640]  according to correspondence with We Are Changed in Ireland
[1:19:01.640 --> 1:19:02.640]  and others we've talked to.
[1:19:02.640 --> 1:19:05.320]  Even mainstream media has said it's suspicious what happened
[1:19:05.320 --> 1:19:08.120]  with the Lisbon Treaty, but we're going to work on getting
[1:19:08.120 --> 1:19:10.840]  him on the show.
[1:19:10.840 --> 1:19:12.680]  We have a special guest coming up next hour.
[1:19:12.680 --> 1:19:14.520]  It's not Nigel Farage.
[1:19:14.520 --> 1:19:16.640]  I'll just leave it at that.
[1:19:16.640 --> 1:19:19.920]  But again, extremely excited about that.
[1:19:19.920 --> 1:19:20.920]  What is coming up?
[1:19:20.920 --> 1:19:22.480]  We just had Jesse Ventura live.
[1:19:22.480 --> 1:19:24.600]  We re-air the Jesse Ventura interview from a few weeks ago
[1:19:24.600 --> 1:19:27.440]  yesterday, not knowing for sure he was going to be on live
[1:19:27.440 --> 1:19:28.440]  today.
[1:19:28.440 --> 1:19:33.840]  Like I said, I got to call Thursday evening from Ventura and
[1:19:33.840 --> 1:19:39.400]  then call him back till Thanksgiving Day to hook that up.
[1:19:39.400 --> 1:19:42.200]  Charlie Sheen will be live with us Sunday.
[1:19:42.200 --> 1:19:45.880]  We've been playing phone tag when he says that's the time that's
[1:19:45.880 --> 1:19:46.880]  good for him.
[1:19:46.880 --> 1:19:49.360]  So 98% chance that's going to be happening Sunday with some other
[1:19:49.360 --> 1:19:50.360]  breaking information.
[1:19:50.360 --> 1:19:53.040]  I hope you all had a great Thanksgiving.

[1:19:57.760 --> 1:20:00.920]  We'll be right back after this break.
[1:20:00.920 --> 1:20:04.080]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood
[1:20:04.080 --> 1:20:07.360]  pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected
[1:20:07.360 --> 1:20:08.360]  by you.
[1:20:08.360 --> 1:20:09.760]  But the symptoms are there.
[1:20:09.760 --> 1:20:13.240]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation
[1:20:13.240 --> 1:20:16.440]  and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert
[1:20:16.440 --> 1:20:18.240]  you that something is wrong.

[1:20:25.880 --> 1:20:27.880]  My diabetes has totally improved.

[1:22:00.520 --> 1:22:04.320]  Did you know that the dollar has lost 10% of its value against
[1:22:04.320 --> 1:22:06.880]  other currencies in the last 90 days?
[1:22:06.880 --> 1:22:10.520]  Ever think about how inflation will change your life, your savings,
[1:22:10.520 --> 1:22:12.040]  your retirement plans?
[1:22:12.040 --> 1:22:15.960]  Ever inflation in Zimbabwe, Argentina, the Weimar Republic?
[1:22:15.960 --> 1:22:17.240]  Let's put this another way.
[1:22:17.240 --> 1:22:21.480]  Who cares if your investments go up 10% but you lose 40% of your
[1:22:21.480 --> 1:22:22.720]  purchasing power?
[1:22:22.720 --> 1:22:25.640]  Gold still buys the same amount of stuff it always did.
[1:22:25.640 --> 1:22:28.120]  Gold does not require trust in a third party.
[1:22:28.120 --> 1:22:29.840]  You can possess it in your hand.
[1:22:29.840 --> 1:22:31.320]  You can take it with you.

[1:23:00.720 --> 1:23:03.680]  Studies have shown that many people do not get the proper vitamins

[1:23:06.600 --> 1:23:10.280]  places to choose from, deciding where and what to buy can be a lengthy,
[1:23:10.280 --> 1:23:11.560]  frustrating process.

[1:24:19.480 --> 1:24:22.000]  Dave Mustaine said he wanted to come back on in November or December.
[1:24:22.000 --> 1:24:23.040]  I haven't contacted him yet.
[1:24:23.040 --> 1:24:26.560]  Let's go and get Dave Mustaine on next week.
[1:24:26.560 --> 1:24:30.800]  Oh, so you guys have been, well, let's get him in studio then.
[1:24:30.800 --> 1:24:34.600]  Oh, my God, then we have to send the email today.
[1:24:34.600 --> 1:24:35.600]  We have his home number.
[1:24:35.600 --> 1:24:36.920]  See, I've been procrastinating.
[1:24:36.920 --> 1:24:39.200]  I don't bug these people.
[1:24:39.200 --> 1:24:44.760]  Craig, send the email as if it's, I mean, let me see it.
[1:24:44.760 --> 1:24:48.560]  Let me see it so that, are you on air in there?
[1:24:48.560 --> 1:24:50.960]  Okay, I couldn't tell because I'm here in an echo.
[1:24:50.960 --> 1:24:51.960]  So you're not on air.
[1:24:51.960 --> 1:24:53.960]  Let's go ahead and write an email.
[1:24:53.960 --> 1:24:57.840]  But as if it's for me, just say, hey, Dave, you said you might want to come on in December.
[1:24:57.840 --> 1:24:58.840]  I hear you're in town.
[1:24:58.840 --> 1:25:02.960]  Can we get you in studio or do another phone or sorry, time got away from me.
[1:25:02.960 --> 1:25:06.400]  We should have gotten in contact with you earlier because you said, you know, give him
[1:25:06.400 --> 1:25:11.120]  a few weeks lead time that he invited me out to San Diego and having him to do that.
[1:25:11.120 --> 1:25:12.800]  And then just say, you talked about hooking up.
[1:25:12.800 --> 1:25:13.960]  We'd love to have you in studio.
[1:25:13.960 --> 1:25:16.000]  Have a car pick you up, something like that.
[1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:18.200]  Tell them we're a few minutes from downtown.
[1:25:18.200 --> 1:25:21.000]  Oh, we're talking like four or five days away.
[1:25:21.000 --> 1:25:22.800]  We got to email him right now.
[1:25:22.800 --> 1:25:25.840]  In fact, give me his number out of the computer.
[1:25:25.840 --> 1:25:29.520]  I'm going to call Dave at the end of the show and just leave a message.
[1:25:29.520 --> 1:25:35.760]  God, see, I told you a week ago to remind me to get to call Dave and it's not your fault.
[1:25:35.760 --> 1:25:37.400]  It's my fault for forgetting.
[1:25:37.400 --> 1:25:41.440]  Um, I just, yeah, let's get Dave Mustaine in studio.
[1:25:41.440 --> 1:25:45.600]  How awesome would that be his new album named after my film in game.
[1:25:45.600 --> 1:25:48.080]  Now a Christian woke up against the new world order.
[1:25:48.080 --> 1:25:49.080]  What a blessing.
[1:25:49.080 --> 1:25:55.160]  It makes all the atheist out there devil or spurs mad, but, uh, like the father of
[1:25:55.160 --> 1:25:58.440]  one of the fathers of modern heavy metal.
[1:25:58.440 --> 1:26:07.760]  In fact, let's come in with, uh, in the next segment, can you queue up, uh, my darkest hour?
[1:26:07.760 --> 1:26:13.160]  I certainly don't want to play that with our next guest coming up in my darkest hour.
[1:26:13.160 --> 1:26:18.560]  I think that's in the computer up at the network actually.
[1:26:18.560 --> 1:26:19.560]  Let's go.
[1:26:19.560 --> 1:26:21.520]  We can play the YouTube on two of you want.
[1:26:21.520 --> 1:26:26.160]  Let's, let's, uh, go out to break and I'll come back and comment on these.
[1:26:26.160 --> 1:26:29.600]  This is, uh, some of the good calls coming into the info war's comment line.
[1:26:29.600 --> 1:26:33.440]  Here it is, war's comment line.
[1:26:33.440 --> 1:26:38.160]  You've got 60 seconds for your question or comment, 60 seconds, and if it's good, we'll
[1:26:38.160 --> 1:26:39.160]  put it on air.
[1:26:39.160 --> 1:26:46.240]  Hi, Alex, this is Brandon from Cleveland, Ohio, uh, I just wanted to say, uh, I noticed
[1:26:46.240 --> 1:26:51.240]  back in high school when I was in economics class, we had textbooks that said that the
[1:26:51.240 --> 1:26:57.240]  Federal Reserve was a independent agency and not part of the government and our teacher
[1:26:57.240 --> 1:26:59.400]  used to stress that to us.
[1:26:59.400 --> 1:27:03.640]  And now that I'm in college, they're taking an economics class that says nowhere in the
[1:27:03.640 --> 1:27:08.920]  book that the Federal Reserve is not a part of the government and my teacher knows that
[1:27:08.920 --> 1:27:12.760]  we had a nice discussion about it in class actually when I brought it up.
[1:27:12.760 --> 1:27:18.800]  But you can just see now that even though it's admitted, they still don't want people
[1:27:18.800 --> 1:27:21.800]  to really know that.
[1:27:21.800 --> 1:27:24.800]  Have a good day.
[1:27:24.800 --> 1:27:28.920]  Hey, Alex, Doug Fielder at, uh, Plano, Texas here.
[1:27:28.920 --> 1:27:33.520]  Uh, listen, my friend, I heard you debate with Alan Combs, uh, regarding the, um, you
[1:27:33.520 --> 1:27:37.080]  know, the FEMA camps and he dismissed you as being an alarmist.
[1:27:37.080 --> 1:27:42.400]  Uh, I've seen Glenn Beck do the same thing on his show and the people I talk on the streets,
[1:27:42.400 --> 1:27:44.640]  they do the same thing when you mention FEMA camps.
[1:27:44.640 --> 1:27:51.160]  I recommend that you post a map of the United States on your website and the location of
[1:27:51.160 --> 1:27:57.040]  all these FEMA camps and you challenge these people and say, Hey, go, you know, uh, I challenge
[1:27:57.040 --> 1:28:02.600]  you to find the nearest FEMA camp near you and, uh, maybe that will wake up a lot of
[1:28:02.600 --> 1:28:03.600]  these people.
[1:28:03.600 --> 1:28:12.000]  Uh, that's it, uh, Hi, Alex, this is evolved from the prison planet forum.
[1:28:12.000 --> 1:28:17.880]  I just wanted to say that I'm sick and tired of the elitist destroying our country.
[1:28:17.880 --> 1:28:21.280]  It's time for the Patriots to rise.
[1:28:21.280 --> 1:28:26.520]  These say, Tannock Hitler wannabes need to take the fall.
[1:28:26.520 --> 1:28:33.200]  Alex, my Patriot brother, I'm Chris out of We Are Changed Ember.
[1:28:33.200 --> 1:28:37.600]  I have some intel for the listeners regarding Follow the Republic.
[1:28:37.600 --> 1:28:41.440]  We all have our own style and my needs to approach strangers and sidewalks and coming
[1:28:41.440 --> 1:28:42.800]  out of stores.
[1:28:42.800 --> 1:28:46.200]  When they see that I intend to give them something, they usually begin to shy away.
[1:28:46.200 --> 1:28:52.440]  I have found through experience that the words free DVD and shadow government work really
[1:28:52.440 --> 1:28:53.520]  well.
[1:28:53.520 --> 1:28:55.160]  Free immediately slows them down.
[1:28:55.160 --> 1:29:01.280]  DVD is neutral, but when I say shadow government, nine out of 10 of them will immediately turn
[1:29:01.280 --> 1:29:03.560]  around and change their whole demeanor.
[1:29:03.560 --> 1:29:07.300]  Their expression goes from stern to open and inquisitive.
[1:29:07.300 --> 1:29:10.400]  Even those who have done their best to ignore the situation know that something big is
[1:29:10.400 --> 1:29:14.240]  going on behind the scenes and I'm presenting a free information source that might shed
[1:29:14.240 --> 1:29:16.920]  some light on what's going on.
[1:29:16.920 --> 1:29:22.200]  Definitely speak in your own words, but include the words free DVD and shadow government
[1:29:22.200 --> 1:29:25.680]  and you'll be amazed at your success out there.
[1:29:25.680 --> 1:29:26.680]  Good luck guys.
[1:29:26.680 --> 1:29:28.600]  Well, good luck to you.
[1:29:28.600 --> 1:29:29.600]  Good job.
[1:29:29.600 --> 1:29:30.600]  Play some more of these.
[1:29:30.600 --> 1:29:31.600]  Take your calls.
[1:29:31.600 --> 1:29:35.920]  Get into all the huge economic developments and a lot more and I'm going to comment on
[1:29:35.920 --> 1:29:38.480]  these phone calls we just got as well.
[1:29:38.480 --> 1:29:42.160]  Stay with us more straight ahead on the GCN radio network.
[1:29:42.160 --> 1:29:50.840]  I'm Alex Jones, infowars.com, prisonplanet.tv.
[1:29:50.840 --> 1:29:52.120]  We're on the march.
[1:29:52.120 --> 1:29:54.560]  The empire's on the run.
[1:29:54.560 --> 1:29:59.960]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[1:29:59.960 --> 1:30:03.880]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Akola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator
[1:30:03.880 --> 1:30:06.840]  that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.

[1:31:59.520 --> 1:32:04.160]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want
[1:32:04.160 --> 1:32:05.160]  you to eat.
[1:32:05.160 --> 1:32:08.680]  If you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you
[1:32:08.680 --> 1:32:13.280]  sick, go to the doctor and buy their drugs, you don't have to cooperate.

[1:33:04.600 --> 1:33:09.600]  Vintage Megadeth, Dave Mustaine, my darkest hour, great poetry.
[1:33:09.600 --> 1:33:13.360]  By the way, we're sending an email out today, we've got him in studio or I'll go interview
[1:33:13.360 --> 1:33:14.360]  him in San Antonio.
[1:33:14.360 --> 1:33:18.600]  He said he wanted to do that when he came to Texas, wanted to go eat barbecue, he said,
[1:33:18.600 --> 1:33:23.400]  but we've kind of forgotten for the last moment, but we're going to work on getting that done.
[1:33:23.400 --> 1:33:26.840]  Let's play a little bit of this song, then I'm going to go to more of your calls and
[1:33:26.840 --> 1:33:32.040]  information, stay with us, crank it up.
[1:33:32.040 --> 1:33:39.480]  We are live by the way, the 27th of November, 2009, we've got a special guest coming up
[1:33:39.480 --> 1:33:44.480]  at T-minus 26 minutes, 20 seconds, believe me, you're not going to want to miss it, talk
[1:33:44.480 --> 1:33:50.160]  about it, you know, tune in right now, this is the darkest hour for the New World Order
[1:33:50.160 --> 1:33:55.000]  as their plants begin crashing down.
[1:33:55.000 --> 1:34:00.920]  As the people who love liberty begin to rise as the awakening spreads, countering the
[1:34:00.920 --> 1:34:07.840]  disease of a globalist.
[1:34:07.840 --> 1:34:16.600]  Our darkest hour is their darkest hour, they're not going to get out of this, not a scratch,
[1:34:16.600 --> 1:34:20.600]  you are not there.
[1:34:20.600 --> 1:34:32.600]  And though I've reached out for you, what a little head, through the darkest hour, grace
[1:34:32.600 --> 1:35:01.600]  did not shine on me, feels home, home, very cold, don't care for me.
[1:35:01.600 --> 1:35:07.600]  Give you everything and you know me too well, I'm bigger than you are, too everything,
[1:35:07.600 --> 1:35:11.600]  stop thinking you're the only one that I'm thinking of.
[1:35:11.600 --> 1:35:22.600]  You never know how hard I try, fires me, sets my future on.
[1:35:22.600 --> 1:35:30.600]  Things don't make me hurt, I'm in love.
[1:35:30.600 --> 1:35:40.600]  Don't try to understand how I feel, I've dropped it all, but oh, I'll never live for you,
[1:35:40.600 --> 1:35:45.600]  till you turn away.
[1:35:45.600 --> 1:35:55.600]  Now, as I die for you, I'm first to cross as I think of me, for all these years,
[1:35:55.600 --> 1:36:01.600]  that I was born, not knowing the truth.
[1:36:01.600 --> 1:36:28.600]  I try to raise your face, but I'm not required.
[1:36:28.600 --> 1:36:38.600]  I won't, I won't know how to understand, this is the end for me, this is my fault,
[1:36:38.600 --> 1:36:45.600]  I'll never live for you, in a perfect world, but I gotta die first,
[1:36:45.600 --> 1:36:57.600]  please don't send me out of my way.
[1:36:57.600 --> 1:37:07.600]  Now, as I die for you, I'm first to cross as I think of me, for all these years,
[1:37:07.600 --> 1:37:17.600]  that I was born, not knowing the truth.
[1:37:17.600 --> 1:37:27.600]  Hey, hey, won't you hurry again, you just ask, all right, can't you hold my word,
[1:37:27.600 --> 1:37:51.600]  do it on the path, try and die for no reason, please don't pass away.
[1:37:51.600 --> 1:37:57.600]  You know, Symphony of Destruction, John, you got that, Symphony of Destruction,
[1:37:57.600 --> 1:38:00.600]  it really tells the New World Order story.
[1:38:00.600 --> 1:38:04.600]  And the new album, Endgame, certainly does as well.
[1:38:04.600 --> 1:38:10.600]  It's been the number one album on a bunch of charts, totally anti-New World Order,
[1:38:10.600 --> 1:38:14.600]  anti-flu vaccine, anti-fema, this is exciting.
[1:38:14.600 --> 1:38:19.600]  Dave Mustaine reaches tens of millions in the US, hundreds of millions worldwide,
[1:38:19.600 --> 1:38:23.600]  giant stadiums in South America and Australia and Europe, and in Rome,
[1:38:23.600 --> 1:38:25.600]  just hundreds of thousands of people.
[1:38:25.600 --> 1:38:29.600]  And they're now learning about Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement,
[1:38:29.600 --> 1:38:33.600]  thanks to Dave Mustaine, who's had really a complete awakening.
[1:38:33.600 --> 1:38:35.600]  He's always done a lot of this, but he's had a complete awakening,
[1:38:35.600 --> 1:38:41.600]  and I just forget how special and important these victories against the New World Order are.
[1:38:41.600 --> 1:38:43.600]  I played a few of those clips.
[1:38:43.600 --> 1:38:47.600]  We are changed inverse states using terms like free DVD and shadow government
[1:38:47.600 --> 1:38:50.600]  that makes people more willing to hear about the truth, certainly does.
[1:38:50.600 --> 1:38:52.600]  All you got to do is reach out to people.
[1:38:52.600 --> 1:38:53.600]  They're ready to hear the truth now, folks.
[1:38:53.600 --> 1:38:58.600]  Our job's a lot easier than it was 10, 15, 20, 30 years ago.
[1:38:58.600 --> 1:39:03.600]  Also, another caller said Glenn Beck would be woken up if they researched FEMA camps.
[1:39:03.600 --> 1:39:05.600]  Beck was sent everything.
[1:39:05.600 --> 1:39:08.600]  Beck was sent the mainstream articles admitting FEMA camps.
[1:39:08.600 --> 1:39:10.600]  He doesn't want to tell the truth.
[1:39:10.600 --> 1:39:11.600]  I don't know about Combs.
[1:39:11.600 --> 1:39:14.600]  I mean, Combs was saying he didn't know anything about world government
[1:39:14.600 --> 1:39:18.600]  as it's openly being announced everywhere. That's why we had him on the show.
[1:39:18.600 --> 1:39:20.600]  I love the call about the Hitler wannabes.
[1:39:20.600 --> 1:39:25.600]  We need to bring them down, Satanic Hitler wannabes.
[1:39:25.600 --> 1:39:29.600]  Let's also play a couple more of these clips.
[1:39:29.600 --> 1:39:33.600]  We'll play the JFA clip, the radio clip, and the Federal Reserve clip.
[1:39:33.600 --> 1:39:40.600]  Here they are, ladies and gentlemen, some of those other audio clips from the listener comment line.
[1:39:40.600 --> 1:39:45.600]  You can call the listener comment line at 512-646-4444,
[1:39:45.600 --> 1:39:49.600]  and we play the best rants or questions or comments.
[1:39:49.600 --> 1:39:53.600]  Let's play those last three we didn't play earlier. Here they are.
[1:39:53.600 --> 1:39:55.600]  Hello, Mr. Jones.
[1:39:55.600 --> 1:39:58.600]  I had a couple quick questions real fast.
[1:39:58.600 --> 1:40:04.600]  One, back in June, you made an article on PrismPlanet.com
[1:40:04.600 --> 1:40:10.600]  and talked about the experience of a female photographer who had unrestricted access
[1:40:10.600 --> 1:40:18.600]  to the World Trade Center site and has all sorts of videos and 9-11 evidence that he's holding on to.
[1:40:18.600 --> 1:40:24.600]  This man is now exiled in Argentina, and I was wondering if you were able to acquire from this evidence.
[1:40:24.600 --> 1:40:31.600]  My second question, I was just wondering what happened to your JFK movie,
[1:40:31.600 --> 1:40:37.600]  if you're ever going to get that finished. Thanks, bye.
[1:40:37.600 --> 1:40:43.600]  There's already a way that your show could be, as you can hear it on your car radio,
[1:40:43.600 --> 1:40:46.600]  is it broadcast on anything that can be picked up in a car radio?
[1:40:46.600 --> 1:40:52.600]  That is my question. I'd like to find out. Thank you.
[1:40:52.600 --> 1:40:56.600]  Okay, let me answer the last question first.
[1:40:56.600 --> 1:41:04.600]  To be technical, the weekday show, we've actually got an accurate count now, is on 57 stations.
[1:41:04.600 --> 1:41:08.600]  Now, some of those stations carry the Sunday show, but a lot of them don't,
[1:41:08.600 --> 1:41:12.600]  and so we have over 30 stations that are individual to the Sunday show,
[1:41:12.600 --> 1:41:18.600]  so total around 80 stations that pick up the show.
[1:41:18.600 --> 1:41:21.600]  A lot of them are little bitty, some of them are big, most of them are mom and pops,
[1:41:21.600 --> 1:41:27.600]  or individually owned, but that sounds like a lot to be on close to 80 or right at 80 stations.
[1:41:27.600 --> 1:41:30.600]  It's not small, but it's not huge.
[1:41:30.600 --> 1:41:33.600]  There's 15,000 radio stations in this country.
[1:41:33.600 --> 1:41:38.600]  RFCC system is to have small transmitters, whereas Europe has big ones that blanket.
[1:41:38.600 --> 1:41:44.600]  We have more stations in the U.S., so XM, what is it?
[1:41:44.600 --> 1:41:52.600]  3 to 7, re-hears every Friday show Saturday, and that's on the Genesis website.
[1:41:52.600 --> 1:41:54.600]  They're kind of testing the waters with us.
[1:41:54.600 --> 1:41:59.600]  Global shortwave, you can listen to the shortwave radio, live 11 to 4, WWCR,
[1:41:59.600 --> 1:42:03.600]  frequency is changing, we go to the wwwcr.com website, look at that.
[1:42:03.600 --> 1:42:07.600]  A lot of people are using internet streaming off their iPhone,
[1:42:07.600 --> 1:42:11.600]  it just plugs into the jack on your car, your little audio port,
[1:42:11.600 --> 1:42:14.600]  and you can just listen wirelessly over the internet,
[1:42:14.600 --> 1:42:18.600]  you just on your iPhone or other device, flycast, all of that.
[1:42:18.600 --> 1:42:19.600]  That's the future.
[1:42:19.600 --> 1:42:22.600]  And because we are the number one radio show on the internet,
[1:42:22.600 --> 1:42:25.600]  according to a whole bunch of different yardsticks,
[1:42:25.600 --> 1:42:32.600]  whatever is number one on the internet is what goes to the top.
[1:42:32.600 --> 1:42:36.600]  Now, Google's being criticized because everything anti-Obama, anti-establishment,
[1:42:36.600 --> 1:42:39.600]  you type in Obama's name, first stuff that comes up is bad.
[1:42:39.600 --> 1:42:42.600]  Type up George Bush's name, first stuff that comes up is bad,
[1:42:42.600 --> 1:42:43.600]  because that's what's the most popular.
[1:42:43.600 --> 1:42:46.600]  Whatever gets the most hits and the most visits, Google's system.
[1:42:46.600 --> 1:42:50.600]  Here's an example, there was a national TV story a couple days ago
[1:42:50.600 --> 1:42:53.600]  where they said, oh, you type in the name of Michelle Obama,
[1:42:53.600 --> 1:42:57.600]  and an unflattering image comes up, and it's prismplanet.com forum.
[1:42:57.600 --> 1:43:01.600]  We don't really mess with that or censor that,
[1:43:01.600 --> 1:43:04.600]  we only have to go in and erase stuff people call for violence.
[1:43:04.600 --> 1:43:07.600]  We don't even have the staff to mess with it.
[1:43:07.600 --> 1:43:10.600]  We have some good moderators in there, but we're not going to take down
[1:43:10.600 --> 1:43:12.600]  the unflattering image of Michelle Obama.
[1:43:12.600 --> 1:43:19.600]  People did that with Bush and First Lady Barbara and First Lady Laura, Hillary.
[1:43:19.600 --> 1:43:23.600]  But Google, the government complained and said,
[1:43:23.600 --> 1:43:28.600]  everything that you type in is unflattering, and it's going to prismplanet.
[1:43:28.600 --> 1:43:29.600]  This was on the news.
[1:43:29.600 --> 1:43:31.600]  We've got to pull that clip up if we have time.
[1:43:31.600 --> 1:43:35.600]  That's because that's what's the most popular thing on Michelle Obama
[1:43:35.600 --> 1:43:37.600]  is her in an unflattering cartoon.
[1:43:37.600 --> 1:43:39.600]  I will just leave it at that.
[1:43:39.600 --> 1:43:41.600]  That's how the internet works.
[1:43:41.600 --> 1:43:43.600]  Now, they're talking about changing that.
[1:43:43.600 --> 1:43:48.600]  But right now on Alexa and Flycast and Shotcast and all these other gauges,
[1:43:48.600 --> 1:43:51.600]  we are number one, number one alternative sites.
[1:43:51.600 --> 1:43:55.600]  Info Wars is number one, Prismplanet's number two.
[1:43:55.600 --> 1:43:58.600]  We've got the first and second place.
[1:43:58.600 --> 1:44:01.600]  Number one on Shotcast for talk radio and many times of the day,
[1:44:01.600 --> 1:44:04.600]  number one period above music.
[1:44:04.600 --> 1:44:06.600]  Number one free radio on the internet.
[1:44:06.600 --> 1:44:08.600]  That is the future.
[1:44:08.600 --> 1:44:09.600]  Okay.
[1:44:09.600 --> 1:44:11.600]  As everybody gets these devices and can tune into it,
[1:44:11.600 --> 1:44:13.600]  I talked to family neighbors.
[1:44:13.600 --> 1:44:15.600]  They go, man, I got an iPhone, went to radio.
[1:44:15.600 --> 1:44:17.600]  You were number one.
[1:44:17.600 --> 1:44:22.600]  And it's quite a responsibility.
[1:44:22.600 --> 1:44:27.600]  I got a big attack the last few weeks by CBS News,
[1:44:27.600 --> 1:44:29.600]  scores with their publications saying,
[1:44:29.600 --> 1:44:30.600]  I'm the king of conspiracy.
[1:44:30.600 --> 1:44:31.600]  I'm dangerous.
[1:44:31.600 --> 1:44:32.600]  I'm incredibly popular.
[1:44:32.600 --> 1:44:34.600]  That's actually kind of freaking me out.
[1:44:34.600 --> 1:44:38.600]  I mean, I never intended to be getting this big and it's exponential.
[1:44:38.600 --> 1:44:40.600]  I mean, we're only beginning to rise.
[1:44:40.600 --> 1:44:42.600]  It's like we got a rocket tied to our back.
[1:44:42.600 --> 1:44:49.600]  And I got called by this high powered operative.
[1:44:49.600 --> 1:44:52.600]  I mean, on record, the guy is a high powered operative of the government
[1:44:52.600 --> 1:44:56.600]  and a foreign government who wants to come interview me coming up later this week
[1:44:56.600 --> 1:44:59.600]  for the front cover of a major magazine.
[1:44:59.600 --> 1:45:02.600]  And you can't really turn it down because they'll just write it and say,
[1:45:02.600 --> 1:45:03.600]  you check them out and wouldn't talk to them.
[1:45:03.600 --> 1:45:12.600]  But I mean, my life's getting pretty, pretty wild is the operative word here
[1:45:12.600 --> 1:45:13.600]  to say the least.
[1:45:13.600 --> 1:45:14.600]  And just we need your prayers.
[1:45:14.600 --> 1:45:17.600]  We need your support now more than ever.
[1:45:17.600 --> 1:45:19.600]  Speaking of support, I haven't even plugged any support yet.
[1:45:19.600 --> 1:45:21.600]  What pays for all these employees out here?
[1:45:21.600 --> 1:45:24.600]  What pays for the TV studio, the radio studio, the work we do,
[1:45:24.600 --> 1:45:28.600]  the rent, the power, the IT bill, you buying the DVDs,
[1:45:28.600 --> 1:45:31.600]  the books, being a PrisonPlanet.tv member.

[1:45:57.600 --> 1:45:59.600]  Because not only do you get great information,
[1:45:59.600 --> 1:46:03.600]  we let you share your passcode with six simultaneous computers
[1:46:03.600 --> 1:46:05.600]  can log on if you've got a membership.
[1:46:05.600 --> 1:46:07.600]  So just don't share it with too many people,
[1:46:07.600 --> 1:46:11.600]  because it'll make our servers crash and your passcode won't work
[1:46:11.600 --> 1:46:13.600]  while six or more people are logged on with your passcode.
[1:46:13.600 --> 1:46:15.600]  It'll start working as soon as they don't.
[1:46:15.600 --> 1:46:19.600]  But share that judiciously, but still the message is to get the material out.
[1:46:19.600 --> 1:46:22.600]  Go to PrisonPlanet.tv, burn all my films to DivX.
[1:46:22.600 --> 1:46:26.600]  We have it in DivX version so it can play, go on regular CDs

[1:46:39.600 --> 1:46:41.600]  So it'll be limited sizes soon.
[1:46:41.600 --> 1:46:42.600]  It isn't right now.
[1:46:42.600 --> 1:46:46.600]  We have all major sizes from small up to XX large.

[1:47:11.600 --> 1:47:14.600]  the film I made with that last interview he did.
[1:47:14.600 --> 1:47:16.600]  Really an honor to him, but it's also very informative.
[1:47:16.600 --> 1:47:18.600]  People that see it say, man, this film should be bigger.
[1:47:18.600 --> 1:47:19.600]  This is important.
[1:47:19.600 --> 1:47:21.600]  Get a free Reflections and Warnings.

[1:47:25.600 --> 1:47:27.600]  Limited time.
[1:47:27.600 --> 1:47:29.600]  Because when that runs out, I may not even print anymore.
[1:47:29.600 --> 1:47:31.600]  I mean, I did a limited printing.
[1:47:31.600 --> 1:47:33.600]  People kept saying, oh, we want that Aaron Russo interview.
[1:47:33.600 --> 1:47:35.600]  We want that Aaron Russo interview.
[1:47:35.600 --> 1:47:37.600]  So I turned it into a whole film.
[1:47:37.600 --> 1:47:43.600]  But the way DVDs work is, if something isn't a super good seller, I can't afford to print more of it,
[1:47:43.600 --> 1:47:45.600]  even though it's great to then just let it sit there on the shelf.
[1:47:45.600 --> 1:47:48.600]  So when that's gone, that's gone.
[1:47:48.600 --> 1:47:51.600]  It's been somewhat successful, but it's been a sleeper for us.
[1:47:51.600 --> 1:47:52.600]  That's why we're giving it away free.
[1:47:52.600 --> 1:47:54.600]  So you find out just how good it is.

[1:49:05.600 --> 1:49:08.600]  We dance like a marionette.
[1:49:08.600 --> 1:49:16.600]  Sway into the symphony of destruction.
[1:49:16.600 --> 1:49:23.600]  Wackin' like a robot.
[1:49:23.600 --> 1:49:30.600]  It's metal brain courage.
[1:49:30.600 --> 1:49:37.600]  You try to take us boss.
[1:49:37.600 --> 1:49:42.600]  Before the head explodes.
[1:49:42.600 --> 1:49:45.600]  Explodes.
[1:49:45.600 --> 1:49:53.600]  Explodes.
[1:49:53.600 --> 1:50:00.600]  Just like the Viper, then raps through the streets.
[1:50:00.600 --> 1:50:03.600]  We dance like a marionette.
[1:50:03.600 --> 1:50:07.600]  Sway into the symphony.
[1:50:07.600 --> 1:50:13.600]  Just like the Viper, then raps through the streets.
[1:50:13.600 --> 1:50:17.600]  We dance like a marionette.
[1:50:17.600 --> 1:50:20.600]  Sway into the symphony.
[1:50:20.600 --> 1:50:35.600]  Sway into the symphony of destruction.
[1:50:50.600 --> 1:50:56.600]  We dance like a marionette.
[1:50:56.600 --> 1:51:22.600]  We dance like a marionette.
[1:51:22.600 --> 1:51:30.600]  Just like the Viper, then raps through the streets.
[1:51:30.600 --> 1:51:37.600]  We dance like a marionette.
[1:51:37.600 --> 1:51:59.600]  Just like the Viper, then raps through the streets.
[1:51:59.600 --> 1:52:09.600]  Just like the Viper, then raps through the streets.
[1:52:29.600 --> 1:52:58.600]  Just like the Viper, then raps through the streets.
[1:52:58.600 --> 1:53:18.600]  Just like the Viper, then raps through the streets.
[1:53:18.600 --> 1:53:27.600]  Just like the Viper, then raps through the streets.
[1:53:27.600 --> 1:53:47.600]  Just like the Viper, then raps through the streets.
[1:53:47.600 --> 1:54:07.600]  Just like the Viper, then raps through the streets.
[1:54:07.600 --> 1:54:32.600]  Just like the Viper, then raps through the streets.
[1:54:32.600 --> 1:54:46.600]  So you don't want to miss what's coming up. We are live on this Black Friday as they call it, 27th day of November 2009.
[1:54:46.600 --> 1:55:04.600]  Dubai in deep water as ripples from debt crisis spread times of London, fears of dangerous new phase of economic crisis swept around the globe yesterday as traders responded to the shock announcement that a debt laden Dubai state corporation was unable to meet its interest bill.
[1:55:04.600 --> 1:55:21.600]  Shares plunged on weak currencies battered from more than 14 billion pounds was wiped from the value of British banks on fears that they would be left nursing new losses. Nervous traders transferred the focus of their anxieties from the risk of companies falling to the risk of nations states defaulting.
[1:55:21.600 --> 1:55:29.600]  Investors owed money by Mexico, Russia and Greece saw the price of insuring themselves against defaults rocket.
[1:55:29.600 --> 1:55:35.600]  And it goes on from there. Another headline out of Bloomberg, Dubai debt delay rattles confidence in Gulf borrowers.
[1:55:35.600 --> 1:55:40.600]  Dollar hits 14 year low against the Japanese yen.
[1:55:40.600 --> 1:55:50.600]  Prompting fears that a further surge could hurt a fragile recovery in the world's second largest economy. And what's gold doing right now? I haven't even looked in the last few hours.
[1:55:50.600 --> 1:56:00.600]  I know it's been rising upwards quickly. So I hate to say see I told you so but man, the globalist are really killing the dollar.
[1:56:00.600 --> 1:56:07.600]  Alaska guests coming up why he thinks that is going on.
[1:56:07.600 --> 1:56:14.600]  And a lot more. All the big new developments on climate gate. It's confirmed the emails are real.
[1:56:14.600 --> 1:56:24.600]  The very code to the computer system, the computer models they use with notes from the programmers about how to engage in fraud, how to cover up the decrease in temperatures.
[1:56:24.600 --> 1:56:33.600]  KXAN locally did another report I saw the other night. I don't even watch television maybe 30 minutes a day saying polar bears are drowning and dying even though their numbers are way up.
[1:56:33.600 --> 1:56:38.600]  Even though they go out on ice flows to hunt with the greatest land swimmer.
[1:56:38.600 --> 1:56:51.600]  I mean it's just unbelievable the fraud meanwhile climate czar says hacked emails don't change anything Washington Times and they're now looking at other countries that mirrored their fraudulent data for the IPCC in the U.N.
[1:56:51.600 --> 1:56:58.600]  New Zealand's climate data shows clear evidence of fraud.
[1:56:58.600 --> 1:57:08.600]  So we'll be going over that as members of the Australian government resign over what's happening in that area of the world as well as New Zealand.
[1:57:08.600 --> 1:57:13.600]  Another author points to climate gates Perry Mason moment when they're caught red handed.
[1:57:13.600 --> 1:57:26.600]  Another great article on the Wall Street Journal how to forge a consensus the impression left by the climate gate emails is that the global warming game has been rigged from the start.
[1:57:26.600 --> 1:57:34.600]  Okay scientists case for climate fears is blown to smithereens whole theory should be destroyed and discarded in U.N. conference should be closed.
[1:57:34.600 --> 1:57:36.600]  We should end this anti scientific nonsense.
[1:57:36.600 --> 1:57:42.600]  Now U.N.'s Copenhagen jamboree is a scandal and it must be stopped.
[1:57:42.600 --> 1:57:52.600]  So we're going to be breaking that down also climate gate five Aussie MPs lead the way by resigning and discussed over the carbon tax.
[1:57:52.600 --> 1:58:00.600]  And that's the amount of the London Telegraph today Australia is leading the revolt against Al Gore's great big AGW conspiracy.
[1:58:00.600 --> 1:58:11.600]  They're caught in a criminal conspiracy to loot economies and have the U.N. government decide who can have businesses and who can't and banning fireplaces space heaters taxes on television sets already in California.
[1:58:11.600 --> 1:58:21.600]  Just as the Aussie geologist and AGW skeptic professor Ian Plummer predicted it would we're going to get geologist Ian Plymer back on ABC News reports at five.
[1:58:21.600 --> 1:58:34.600]  Front ventures from Australia's opposition liberal party have resigned their portfolios rather than follow their leader Malcolm Turnbull in voting for Kevin Rudd's government on a new emissions trading scheme.
[1:58:34.600 --> 1:58:44.600]  So they're ramming that through right now we're going to go to break ladies and gentlemen and come back with somebody that I have been chomping at the bit to get on like no guest ever for some reason.
[1:58:44.600 --> 1:58:59.600]  It's because well he's so well spoken so focused at such a great track record of research.
[1:58:59.600 --> 1:59:17.600]  And others urge vaccination avoidance instead use vitamin C D and oxy silver along with zeolife for broad spectrum detoxification using NASA science oxy silver is nano silver covalently bonded to water oxy silver safely electrocutes pathogens oxygenates for faster healing
[1:59:17.600 --> 1:59:34.600]  and delivers a 528 Hertz frequency homeopathic like energy. The doctor Horowitz proves his fundamental to life and recovering health. He also recommends zeolife for blood cleansing and GI flora pro as a probiotic for intestinal immunity help others and earn extra income become a healthy world affiliate free

[1:59:52.600 --> 2:00:19.600]  Waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network Big Brother mainstream media government cover ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas.
[2:00:19.600 --> 2:00:22.600]  Alex Jones.
[2:00:49.600 --> 2:01:07.600]  He is also an award winning researcher but rather than go over his lengthy pedigree and amazing research let's go directly to Lord Moncton joining us from the United Kingdom sir it is wonderful to have you with us.
[2:01:07.600 --> 2:01:26.600]  It's great to be with you. Amazing we've got you for a full hour our listeners are just absolutely in ecstasy right now because you and your clear straight piercing voice and intellect have been one of the main people just just annihilating these frauds it's good to have you with us.
[2:01:26.600 --> 2:01:38.600]  Well flattery will get you everywhere you can get up off your knees now take off the white gloves and you know that no longer need to touch your forelock well I don't want my children to be slaves to the UN and a global government tax and so I got to tell you sir.
[2:01:38.600 --> 2:01:46.600]  We pop champagne last week when it came out those emails were real and I would imagine you were popping some champagne.
[2:01:46.600 --> 2:01:56.600]  Well we've been following the people named in these emails for years we thought they were linked and of course these emails established exactly how they were linked.
[2:01:56.600 --> 2:02:14.600]  And it's very very interesting because we had suspected there were just about two dozen people who round the world mostly this side of Atlantic and in America who were putting this global warming scam together and actually driving it rather than doing what the likes of Al Gore and the politicians do just drifting along with it because they don't know any better.
[2:02:14.600 --> 2:02:27.600]  These are the people who have known all along that there isn't a problem and they've been bending the data and admitting to each other they've been bending the data for the sake of concealing the fact that their data are no good.
[2:02:27.600 --> 2:02:43.600]  Absolutely and I mean this really proves a conspiracy here doesn't it you have called for the prosecution of the climate criminals you were the first now many other representatives from Australia to the United States are calling for criminal investigations.
[2:02:43.600 --> 2:03:00.600]  There's going to have to be a criminal investigation by the information commissioner whose job is to make sure that publicly available information is available to the public and that officials like these creeps in the climate research centre and their colleagues all over the United States as well.
[2:03:00.600 --> 2:03:13.600]  Were prevented from hiding destroying tampering with shuffling away the data which we paid for and it therefore belongs to us and they used a series of excuses.
[2:03:13.600 --> 2:03:22.600]  They said well as a data protection act they said the data belong to other countries weather bureaus hey this is weather data it's not a state secret.
[2:03:22.600 --> 2:03:31.600]  They were trying to say that they weren't going they were emailing each other they were saying we are not going to give this data to anybody.
[2:03:31.600 --> 2:03:48.600]  They were even saying they wouldn't write any learning papers for journals which required as part of the peer review process that all the data and all the computer code and all the intermediate calculations should be shown and archived so that other scientists could check it.
[2:03:48.600 --> 2:03:57.600]  They were determined that other scientists shouldn't be allowed to check their work because they knew that they were simply making things up.
[2:03:57.600 --> 2:04:13.600]  These people are financial fraudsters they took at least twenty million dollars that we can trace in recent years in so called grants for so called scientific research and they did it on the basis of a financial and scientific fraud.
[2:04:13.600 --> 2:04:20.600]  So they should not only be locked up for concealing and destroying data that have been requested under the freedom of information act by other scientists.
[2:04:20.600 --> 2:04:26.600]  They should also be locked up for financial fraud and international racketeering.
[2:04:26.600 --> 2:04:35.600]  Well said sir we're going to come right back after this quick break the long segment I would like to blow by blow get your detailed knowledge of this.
[2:04:35.600 --> 2:04:49.600]  Some of the history who these people are what their bigger goals are and then specifically right through climate gate all the different sectors of fraud that they have engaged in like covering up the four request persecuting
[2:04:49.600 --> 2:04:59.600]  scientists colluding to persecute people which is racketeering which is extortion fraud grant fraud and now their response saying so what.
[2:04:59.600 --> 2:05:10.600]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power if so this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear solar powered generators are now available from solutions from science in Thompson Illinois.
[2:05:10.600 --> 2:05:21.600]  These emergency backup systems provide life saving electrical power when you need it most unlike gas generators a solar generator runs quietly emits no fumes and produces electricity for free.
[2:05:21.600 --> 2:05:33.600]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home run some pumps shortwave radios computers and even keep food from spoiling whether it's hurricanes ice storms brownouts or blackouts.
[2:05:33.600 --> 2:05:42.600]  You'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again when the power goes out you'll be ready with a solar powered generator from solutions from science.
[2:05:42.600 --> 2:05:59.600]  Go to my solar backup dot com and get off the grid today that's my solar backup dot com or call 877-327-0365 877-327-0365 don't wait call today.
[2:05:59.600 --> 2:06:11.600]  Hello this is Alex Jones with some important questions if you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm how much ammunition do you want my answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom.
[2:06:11.600 --> 2:06:22.600]  And the lives of your loved ones food is your only ammunition how much do you want when do you want it now or after the battle starts when will you need it can you buy it without proper identification.

[2:08:00.600 --> 2:08:22.600]  He's the T-rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. Well for the rest of the hour Lord Christopher Moncton third by count of Moncton and Brinchley worked at the highest levels of the UK government at 10 Downing Street one of the chief advisors to then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
[2:08:22.600 --> 2:08:37.600]  You can find out more about his bio by visiting his website. We'll give that out again repeatedly before he leaves us. But some stations just joined us recapping Lord Moncton. Tell us about yourself. You've been talking about this for more than a decade.
[2:08:37.600 --> 2:08:47.600]  And now what climate gate means the different sectors of fraud and how you believe from your perspective this should be prosecuted.
[2:08:47.600 --> 2:09:03.600]  For those who haven't come across climate gate this was the release of a large number of emails between about two dozen malevolent crooked scientists right at the top of the climate a logical tree.
[2:09:03.600 --> 2:09:27.600]  These are the people who between them have conspired to invent and then maintain the scare of global warming. And the emails came from the University of East Anglia's climatic research center which specializes in calculating the global temperature record for the whole world over the last
[2:09:27.600 --> 2:09:41.600]  150 years since we first began having what one might call global instrumental coverage with thermometers all over the world. And it's quite a complex process because very few of the temperature stations remain in the same place for any length of time.
[2:09:41.600 --> 2:09:52.600]  They come in and out some work some stop working some don't report properly some don't report at all. Hold chunks of Russia disappeared in 1990 when the Berlin Wall came down.
[2:09:52.600 --> 2:10:10.600]  So it's very difficult actually to make sensible this data. But unfortunately what they were doing at the climate research center with active assistance from many other climate scientists around the world was they were simply making up the 20th century record of temperatures.
[2:10:10.600 --> 2:10:28.600]  So we don't even know how much warmer it has got over the 20th century. We know broadly speaking it's got warmer because it's been getting warmer for 300 years. Nothing to do with us. But we didn't know how much. And the whole idea of having this very elaborate international network of temperature stations with people going and looking in little
[2:10:28.600 --> 2:10:42.600]  boxes and making a note of the temperature every day and then phoning their local weather bureau and that then being passed on to just two or three places around the world of which East Anglia was one where they compile these records. This was an enormously elaborate piece of work.
[2:10:42.600 --> 2:10:56.600]  And then when it got to East Anglia and the other and the two American universities where this was processed what they did then as we now know because we've seen their computer code and we've seen their data. They didn't store the data properly. They didn't keep it in an organized form.
[2:10:56.600 --> 2:11:12.600]  They didn't know by the end of it what their own computer program was doing. But they were processing all of the data several times over and it had become a complete mess. And essentially they were simply making up the temperature increases of the last 20 years.
[2:11:12.600 --> 2:11:16.600]  It is simply a fiction. It's science fiction.
[2:11:16.600 --> 2:11:27.600]  Well expanding on that. And of course you obviously have read the emails. They talk about temperatures are dropping. How do we fix it. How do we spin it. How do we hide the decline.
[2:11:27.600 --> 2:11:41.600]  And then of course there's the whole area of how they're talking about keeping people out of journals persecuting journals blocking for your request working with government officials to block this information from the public. I mean this is racketeering.
[2:11:41.600 --> 2:11:57.600]  It is racketeering. I think I think it does. It is nicely covered by your RICO statute. And funny enough we have just put a new act on the statute book a few years ago called the fraud act. And this is fraud on our side of Atlantic and racketeering as you would call it on yours.
[2:11:57.600 --> 2:12:13.600]  These are people who deserve to go to prison for a very long time. And I'll tell you why I'm so angry about it because it is a point that nearly always forgotten in all the commentaries about climate change that global warming isn't killing anyone and it isn't going to kill anyone.
[2:12:13.600 --> 2:12:36.600]  What is killing people and killing them by the million of starvation now is the effect of the global warming scare because many nations including the United States have taken up to a third of their agricultural land out from growing food for people who needed it to growing biofuels for clunkers that didn't.
[2:12:36.600 --> 2:12:54.600]  And that has meant in the last year or two a doubling and I mean a doubling of world food prices and the World Bank says that nearly all of that doubling of world food prices is directly attributed to the biofuels scam which in turn is directly caused by the global warming scare
[2:12:54.600 --> 2:13:09.600]  and government saying well even if it isn't true we've got to take precautions but you have to remember you also have to take precautions to check that the precautions you're taking are not killing people by the million which is what this policy of biofuels is actually doing.
[2:13:09.600 --> 2:13:33.600]  By the way, all of this scare comes out from these idiots and these crooks and these criminals. I am very sorry I'm not kind of keeping my normal calm self here. I am so incandescent with fury that these people whom we as British taxpayers and you as American taxpayers have been paying to do this work and we have been trusting them to do it right.
[2:13:33.600 --> 2:13:46.600]  They have simply not only been making it up but as you rightly say they have been tampering with the peer review process trying to interfere with reviewers to persuade them to pass or not to pass papers they didn't like.
[2:13:46.600 --> 2:13:57.600]  They've been trying to bully journal editors whom they don't like into resigning and getting the boards of the papers to appoint the learned journals to appoint somebody else more agreeable to them.
[2:13:57.600 --> 2:14:06.600]  They've been interfering with the process of the UN climate panel itself by saying in one case here are two papers we don't like because they show that we're wrong.
[2:14:06.600 --> 2:14:19.600]  We will make sure that these papers do not ever get anywhere near the UN climate report for 2007 even if we have to redefine the peer review process in order to do it.
[2:14:19.600 --> 2:14:36.600]  That's how far they've gone to bend the entire process of scientific research at every level from the gathering of the data to the storage of the data to the processing of the data to making the data available to other people to writing up the data to doing the papers
[2:14:36.600 --> 2:14:46.600]  explaining what it means calculating the temperatures putting the papers in the peer review journals trying to interfere with the peer review journals interfering with the process of the UN climate panel itself.
[2:14:46.600 --> 2:14:59.600]  The conspiracy from top to bottom run by extremely powerful scientists who had got away for decades with challenging anyone who dared to argue with them by saying you're not a scientist.
[2:14:59.600 --> 2:15:06.600]  You don't know what you're talking about. We're not going to pay any attention to you. They've said that to me and about me time and again.
[2:15:06.600 --> 2:15:17.600]  They describe me in one of their emails of a charlatan. Well I don't mind insults but these people are charlatan themselves. Pot calls kettle black.
[2:15:17.600 --> 2:15:31.600]  These people deserve to be locked up and locked up for a very very very long time and never ever again to be allowed to hold any position of public trust or be paid a single penny of taxpayer money.
[2:15:31.600 --> 2:15:43.600]  Well Lord Moncton that's the point is there's so much fraud as I sit here and research it saying that polar bears couldn't swim when they're the greatest land swimmer and hunt on the ice flows and their numbers have exploded.
[2:15:43.600 --> 2:15:56.600]  Fact local news in Austin last night so the polar bears are all dying total fraud lying with the hockey stick Al Gore putting the graph together knowing that carbon dioxide comes after warming lying about that.
[2:15:56.600 --> 2:16:08.600]  And then saying all scientists agreed with them and pointing to their twenty five hundred pets when it was only three universities as you pointed out producing the fraud the others just signed on to the fraud believing it.
[2:16:08.600 --> 2:16:18.600]  Then we have them calling people climate deniers saying people need to be locked up who disagree with them clearly authoritarian.
[2:16:18.600 --> 2:16:30.600]  I mean this is outrageous and now the US climate czar in the Washington Times says hacked emails don't change anything and I've seen London Guardian articles where they're whining talking about how you and others.
[2:16:30.600 --> 2:16:37.600]  Are persecuting the poor scientist when they're in the emails talking about how to persecute you.
[2:16:37.600 --> 2:16:51.600]  That's right and I'm going to go on persecuting them if that's the way they like to call it I'm going to go on because whether they like it or not and they've done more than anyone to try to stop the world continuing to be free.
[2:16:51.600 --> 2:17:00.600]  Well we've had people like James Hansen you've just quoted him saying the people like me should be placed on trial for high crimes against humanity.
[2:17:00.600 --> 2:17:07.600]  Hey I'm not the person killing people by starvation worldwide because of mad policies based on bad science.
[2:17:07.600 --> 2:17:17.600]  That's what they're doing and they have got to go on trial for high crimes against humanity because what they have been doing is they have been recklessly and deliberately.
[2:17:17.600 --> 2:17:34.600]  Making up science falsifying science then doing their best to use the cover of the data protection act and government privilege to prevent people from other scientists from legitimately asking to get the data which they then said they would destroy rather than giving it out.
[2:17:34.600 --> 2:17:47.600]  It is at every level a howling outrage how we deal with it I think that they're going to have to be prosecutions on this side Atlantic indictment on your side people are going to have to go to jail and be put on trial.
[2:17:47.600 --> 2:17:56.600]  Not only for fraud but I think we're going to need to send some of them to the international criminal court for crimes against humanity.
[2:17:56.600 --> 2:18:09.600]  Because so many people are dying in the poorest countries as a direct result of the lunatic policy being pursued by half witted government people with scientifically illiterate and innumerate.
[2:18:09.600 --> 2:18:22.600]  Because who don't know any science and therefore they have a kind of white coat syndrome a scientist comes along and tells them something and they simply believe it particularly if it happens to suit their political predilection which means on the whole.
[2:18:22.600 --> 2:18:30.600]  It's much easier to persuade the left of the nonsense these people have been peddling but it is the right to tend to be more skeptical of this kind of thing.
[2:18:30.600 --> 2:18:54.600]  Even on the right like our government here and like Malcolm in the United States in Australia that they have been taking the side of the climate record these people who are making up the data and instead of saying right now we can see you know the scales have been lifted from our eyes we can see we have been deceived.
[2:18:54.600 --> 2:19:03.600]  And therefore we are going to cancel the Copenhagen conference we're not going to go we're not going to have a Copenhagen treaty they're all going to go anyway.
[2:19:03.600 --> 2:19:14.600]  It was literally two days after the these emails exploded all over the web because they didn't really get into the mainstream media which have been telling the other story and can't bear to admit they got it wrong.
[2:19:14.600 --> 2:19:23.600]  But the internet has exploded with these emails two days after that President Obama announces oh I'm going to Copenhagen we've got to save the planet what planet is he trying to save.
[2:19:23.600 --> 2:19:30.600]  It was saved 2,000 years ago and it certainly doesn't need to be saved now by President Obama thank you very much.
[2:19:30.600 --> 2:19:32.600]  Yeah these fraudsters go even further.
[2:19:32.600 --> 2:19:38.600]  Billing Al Gore in Newsweek as the prophet his plan for the earth he's going to save us.
[2:19:38.600 --> 2:19:41.600]  When we come back I want to get into the point you made about people dying.
[2:19:41.600 --> 2:19:52.600]  Anyone can Google and find mainstream university reports where if they make moderate carbon dioxide cuts in industry one billion third world people will die in the next decade.
[2:19:52.600 --> 2:20:00.600]  That is a conservative estimate and we have the Royal Commission on population from the 40s discussing this we have.
[2:20:00.600 --> 2:20:11.600]  This is big John Lipscomb world government and all its tyranny is rapidly approaching the choices you make today will determine your level of suffering and freedom tomorrow.
[2:20:11.600 --> 2:20:16.600]  I have two solutions for you so you and your family can stay strong and free.
[2:20:16.600 --> 2:20:24.600]  Patriot food dot com 135 pounds of long lasting dehydrated food in 25 varieties.

[2:20:40.600 --> 2:20:51.600]  That's over 4 pounds of seed and I ship it in a time capsule so they will last decades and now you can get a second for a $60 savings.
[2:20:51.600 --> 2:21:10.600]  Patriot food dot com and survivalist seeds dot com anything else is just a copycat.

[2:22:06.600 --> 2:22:07.600]  I get it.
[2:22:07.600 --> 2:22:16.600]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy that social security would be there for you.
[2:22:16.600 --> 2:22:18.600]  That's not what's happening.
[2:22:18.600 --> 2:22:26.600]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation or that the dollar wouldn't lose value or that your retirement would be secure.
[2:22:26.600 --> 2:22:30.600]  If all looks rosy to you then now is not the time to buy gold.
[2:22:30.600 --> 2:22:34.600]  For the realists there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[2:22:34.600 --> 2:22:40.600]  Since 2001 the US dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%.
[2:22:40.600 --> 2:22:43.600]  Right now savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.

[2:23:58.600 --> 2:24:07.600]  Lord Moncton is our guest.
[2:24:07.600 --> 2:24:09.600]  He is going to Copenhagen.
[2:24:09.600 --> 2:24:11.600]  I just talked to him.
[2:24:11.600 --> 2:24:15.600]  He's going to be gracious enough to give us a report from Copenhagen.
[2:24:15.600 --> 2:24:17.600]  This is just amazing.
[2:24:17.600 --> 2:24:21.600]  This is a short-segment, long-segment coming up to get into plenty of information.
[2:24:21.600 --> 2:24:26.600]  But I don't want to just skip over the fact that global warming, man-made global warming,
[2:24:26.600 --> 2:24:30.600]  is meant to destroy industrial society, as Maurice Strong has said.
[2:24:30.600 --> 2:24:35.600]  Sir, can you go over just briefly some of the evidence of what this will do from their own words?
[2:24:35.600 --> 2:24:40.600]  They want to shut down the industrial society and have a global government in their own words.
[2:24:40.600 --> 2:24:51.600]  As Von Rompe had just said last week, the new EU chief to bring in global governance where this group of bureaucrats become the new kings and queens over a giant tyranny.
[2:24:51.600 --> 2:24:58.600]  That's exactly what the aim has been. So Maurice Strong, who was a Canadian bureaucrat at the UN 25 years ago,
[2:24:58.600 --> 2:25:08.600]  it was he who decided that setting up the intergovernmental panel on climate change as a political body rather than a scientific one
[2:25:08.600 --> 2:25:20.600]  would be the trojan horse by which the UN could achieve its long-held ambition of turning itself into a dictatorial world government.
[2:25:20.600 --> 2:25:28.600]  And a few weeks ago, thanks to a very diligent scientist called Willie Soon at the Harvard Smithsonian Institute for Astrophysics,
[2:25:28.600 --> 2:25:39.600]  I was able to get hold of an advanced copy of the draft Treaty of Copenhagen, which I'm going to go to Copenhagen to try to negotiate away next week.
[2:25:39.600 --> 2:25:47.600]  But there'll be 200 countries there, 250 UN bureaucracies, different bureaucracies will be there, let alone how many bureaucrats in each bureaucracy.
[2:25:47.600 --> 2:25:54.600]  It's a huge jamboree. And in the draft treaty, it said they were going to set up a world government.
[2:25:54.600 --> 2:25:59.600]  The world government actually appears in the treaty in this context for the first time that I've ever seen it.
[2:25:59.600 --> 2:26:08.600]  And I've negotiated quite a few of these treaties in the past. And it's going to give this government the power to control all formerly free markets,
[2:26:08.600 --> 2:26:13.600]  a point which Von Rompe, the new dictator of Europe, has also just said.
[2:26:13.600 --> 2:26:20.600]  He doesn't want free markets anymore. He wants it regulated. And that's what they're going to do to market all around the world,
[2:26:20.600 --> 2:26:24.600]  or in the name of saving the planet from a problem we know is no longer a real problem.
[2:26:24.600 --> 2:26:30.600]  Well, that's what Ban Ki-moon said in the New York Times three weeks ago. He said the UN will control world resources and a global government.
[2:26:30.600 --> 2:26:39.600]  That's exactly their ambition. They want nothing less than total world domination to use the old phrase.
[2:26:39.600 --> 2:26:47.600]  And rather than doing it by going to war, as they would have had to in the old days, like Alexander of Macedon or Adolf Hitler or Napoleon,
[2:26:47.600 --> 2:26:55.600]  all these people with more ambitions than taste, they want to do it by a bureaucratic stealthy coup d'etat.
[2:26:55.600 --> 2:27:06.600]  What they did was they hid this draft treaty as an annex to a two-page note by the secretariat of the Conference of the States Parties
[2:27:06.600 --> 2:27:14.600]  of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, buried on a UN website. That's where Willie Soon, who reads everything, thank heaven, found it.
[2:27:14.600 --> 2:27:22.600]  He saw it, sent it straight to me, and I discovered in the annex to this note 186 pages of a draft treaty,
[2:27:22.600 --> 2:27:29.600]  which they had kept secret by putting it openly on a website but burying it as an annex without saying it was there,
[2:27:29.600 --> 2:27:35.600]  so that when they had eventually pushed this treaty through, they were going to turn round with looks of surprise on their faces
[2:27:35.600 --> 2:27:39.600]  and say, what do you mean we hadn't published it? It's been on our website for weeks.
[2:27:39.600 --> 2:27:48.600]  That's the sort of game these shabby people play to try to trick us into giving up our freedom, our democracy, and our prosperity.
[2:27:48.600 --> 2:27:54.600]  And of course the UN, the U.S. Constitution, would be made subject to this new treaty.
[2:27:54.600 --> 2:28:01.600]  If this treaty is signed by Obama, even if the Senate doesn't ratify it, and I don't think the Senate now will,
[2:28:01.600 --> 2:28:07.600]  because I've been into the Senate and talked to several senators and I said, you sign this, it's over the dead body of the American Constitution.
[2:28:07.600 --> 2:28:11.600]  Don't do it. And I don't think they will. I've spoken to several of them now.
[2:28:11.600 --> 2:28:19.600]  The trouble is though that Obama might just say, well, I have signed this treaty using my executive authority as president,
[2:28:19.600 --> 2:28:25.600]  and I am either going to enact it into domestic law by a simple majority of both houses as an ordinary domestic law,
[2:28:25.600 --> 2:28:32.600]  or I'm going to go to the Supreme Court and say, look, the trend of law is toward global governance and dictatorship now,
[2:28:32.600 --> 2:28:41.600]  democracy has had its day, and the Supreme Court, as at present constituted, which hates democracy with a passion of an abiding loathing,
[2:28:41.600 --> 2:28:45.600]  will go along with him by fear and grant him his wish.
[2:28:45.600 --> 2:28:52.600]  So the important thing is that when he goes to Copenhagen, we have to do everything in our power to try to stop him signing.
[2:28:52.600 --> 2:28:59.600]  The American Constitution and your freedom and your democracy away, because if your freedom goes down the pan,
[2:28:59.600 --> 2:29:02.600]  then so does the freedom of the rest of the world.
[2:29:02.600 --> 2:29:11.600]  Well said. And many members of the Supreme Court have said they want global government in USA today that we should follow the orders of the UN.
[2:29:11.600 --> 2:29:20.600]  So we are in grave danger. We now see the European treaty being implemented by stealth, not letting the British people have a vote.
[2:29:20.600 --> 2:29:29.600]  And Obama's saying he's going to use the federal bureaucracy to implement by piecemeal many parts of these global treaties.
[2:29:29.600 --> 2:29:34.600]  Schwarzenegger is banning and taxing television sets over their carbon footprint.
[2:29:34.600 --> 2:29:40.600]  So it appears that they're trying to force this, even if they can't do it legislatively.
[2:29:40.600 --> 2:29:48.600]  Lord Christopher Moncton is our guest. He is the third vice count Moncton of Wrenchley.
[2:29:48.600 --> 2:29:50.600]  We're going to come right back and get into the master plan.
[2:29:50.600 --> 2:29:59.600]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:29:59.600 --> 2:30:06.600]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Acolla Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[2:30:06.600 --> 2:30:12.600]  No, this isn't science fiction. It's very real. I know because I use one every day in my own home and it's available right now to you.
[2:30:12.600 --> 2:30:19.600]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Acolla Blue, you'll know what's in your cup. Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.

[2:30:59.600 --> 2:31:04.600]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[2:31:04.600 --> 2:31:08.600]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[2:31:08.600 --> 2:31:14.600]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[2:31:14.600 --> 2:31:19.600]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[2:31:19.600 --> 2:31:24.600]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[2:31:24.600 --> 2:31:28.600]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[2:31:28.600 --> 2:31:35.600]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[2:31:35.600 --> 2:31:40.600]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[2:31:40.600 --> 2:31:45.600]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[2:31:45.600 --> 2:31:51.600]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.

[2:33:16.600 --> 2:33:22.600]  He's with us for another 26 minutes. He's going to be reporting here for us coming on when he's in Copenhagen.
[2:33:22.600 --> 2:33:29.600]  We're lining that up. It's so very important that he be there with his measured focus, like a laser beam intellect,
[2:33:29.600 --> 2:33:32.600]  exposing these people. He's been fighting them for decades.
[2:33:32.600 --> 2:33:38.600]  And of course, laying out that their science was fraud because scientists would get the raw data,
[2:33:38.600 --> 2:33:45.600]  and it didn't match what this pet university used by the UN to put out this fraud was saying.
[2:33:45.600 --> 2:33:50.600]  But sir, I mean, you're someone who I know doesn't want the credit, but you deserve the credit,
[2:33:50.600 --> 2:33:55.600]  literally setting bushfires in the minds of men, as Thomas Jefferson said,
[2:33:55.600 --> 2:34:05.600]  here in the United States and Canada with your tour, perfect fate or providence building up to these wonderful leakers,
[2:34:05.600 --> 2:34:12.600]  probably not hackers, leakers, inside this head climatology bureau at East Anglia.
[2:34:12.600 --> 2:34:19.600]  I mean, just amazing. Can you speak to that? And then, number two, to the mindset of Maurice Strong.
[2:34:19.600 --> 2:34:25.600]  I talked to you during a break. You said you had read Ecoscience and their calls for world population reduction,
[2:34:25.600 --> 2:34:34.600]  drugging the water, just a planetary regime to carry out the police state and then the world population reduction.
[2:34:34.600 --> 2:34:42.600]  Let's go back to the book that John Holdren, who is the current so-called science star,
[2:34:42.600 --> 2:34:45.600]  of course, we would call him a commissar. That's what he is.
[2:34:45.600 --> 2:34:49.600]  You know, he's a communist, this guy, and an openly admitted communist.
[2:34:49.600 --> 2:34:52.600]  And he's the science advisor to the President of the United States, can you believe it?
[2:34:52.600 --> 2:35:00.600]  He, with Paul Ehrlich, wrote a book 30 years ago in which he said that because of humankind's influence on the climate,
[2:35:00.600 --> 2:35:06.600]  it was going to be rapid global cooling in the next 10 years, he said.
[2:35:06.600 --> 2:35:13.600]  And this was going to cause so much ice to pile up on Antarctica that it would fall off and fall into the water
[2:35:13.600 --> 2:35:18.600]  and cause a tidal wave bigger than any ever seen in human history.
[2:35:18.600 --> 2:35:20.600]  And I'm actually quoting from the book when I say that.
[2:35:20.600 --> 2:35:22.600]  That was his view 30 years ago.
[2:35:22.600 --> 2:35:28.600]  Now, with seamless mendacity, he now says that what we're facing is global warming,
[2:35:28.600 --> 2:35:31.600]  also from human influence on the climate.
[2:35:31.600 --> 2:35:38.600]  And actually, there is no more basis whatsoever for saying that there's going to be global warming than there is global cooling.
[2:35:38.600 --> 2:35:44.600]  I checked that with Professor Dick Linsen of MIT, who knows more about the atmosphere than anyone
[2:35:44.600 --> 2:35:48.600]  and doesn't believe a word of either the global cooling or the global warming story.
[2:35:48.600 --> 2:35:52.600]  And he says, if you want to take a bet, he said it's 50-50,
[2:35:52.600 --> 2:35:57.600]  whether it will be warmer than today or cooler than today in 50 years' time.
[2:35:57.600 --> 2:35:59.600]  There's no way you can tell.
[2:35:59.600 --> 2:36:04.600]  And all these people telling us that if we don't clean up our act, it's somehow going to become warmer
[2:36:04.600 --> 2:36:06.600]  when they were previously telling us it was going to become cooler.
[2:36:06.600 --> 2:36:12.600]  How can anyone like Holder stand up with a straight face and expect anyone to believe him?
[2:36:12.600 --> 2:36:18.600]  But they do because they know that the mainstream media are now so left-wing,
[2:36:18.600 --> 2:36:23.600]  so captured by the desire to set up this communistic world government
[2:36:23.600 --> 2:36:29.600]  to do away with democracy forever by stealth, using the excuse of saving the planet,
[2:36:29.600 --> 2:36:30.600]  that they will drift along with it.
[2:36:30.600 --> 2:36:33.600]  If you take people like Samarit Strong, what's in it for him?
[2:36:33.600 --> 2:36:36.600]  He's made a lot of money out of it over the years.
[2:36:36.600 --> 2:36:40.600]  In fact, he was done under the UN World Oil for Food program at one stage
[2:36:40.600 --> 2:36:42.600]  for having put his fingers in the till.
[2:36:42.600 --> 2:36:46.600]  These are the people now who are lauding it over us.
[2:36:46.600 --> 2:36:50.600]  And in the British understanding of the term aristocracy,
[2:36:50.600 --> 2:36:56.600]  it comes from the Greek word rule by the best, or aristoi, the best.
[2:36:56.600 --> 2:36:59.600]  Now we have what I call a catechistocracy of black art.
[2:36:59.600 --> 2:37:01.600]  It's ruled by the worst.
[2:37:01.600 --> 2:37:08.600]  People who have absolutely no moral principle, they don't care how many people they kill
[2:37:08.600 --> 2:37:09.600]  with their policies.
[2:37:09.600 --> 2:37:14.600]  They don't care that countries in the third world are going to be poor and are going to be starved.
[2:37:14.600 --> 2:37:21.600]  There is a direct correlation between the amount of CO2 that you burn in a nation
[2:37:21.600 --> 2:37:27.600]  per head of population and the longevity and prosperity of the population.
[2:37:27.600 --> 2:37:30.600]  The more CO2 you burn, the longer you live.
[2:37:30.600 --> 2:37:34.600]  The less CO2 you burn, the more your children die young.
[2:37:34.600 --> 2:37:39.600]  These figures are absolutely plain, and it is an outrage that people like Holdren
[2:37:39.600 --> 2:37:45.600]  dare to say that they want to stop the world from burning CO2 when they must know
[2:37:45.600 --> 2:37:50.600]  that the consequence of that policy will be to do what is already happening,
[2:37:50.600 --> 2:37:55.600]  to kill people in the poorer countries who need above all else to use fossil fuels
[2:37:55.600 --> 2:38:01.600]  to lift themselves out of poverty, because it's only if you do lift yourself out of poverty
[2:38:01.600 --> 2:38:04.600]  and become reasonably prosperous as a population as a whole,
[2:38:04.600 --> 2:38:08.600]  not just a few elite in the middle, but the whole population becoming more prosperous,
[2:38:08.600 --> 2:38:16.600]  that and only that is what stabilizes the population and reduces the world footprint on the planet
[2:38:16.600 --> 2:38:21.600]  and allows other creatures to live with us without being crowded out.
[2:38:21.600 --> 2:38:24.600]  But Lord Moncton, that we go on burning fossil fuels.
[2:38:24.600 --> 2:38:28.600]  Lord Moncton, the fraud is so obvious where they were saying global cooling,
[2:38:28.600 --> 2:38:33.600]  then it was global warming, now they say climate change, the oceans are going to turn into acid.
[2:38:33.600 --> 2:38:38.600]  I mean they keep saying the science is all settled when they're all manifest quack frauds
[2:38:38.600 --> 2:38:45.600]  who all of them write books about planetary governments forcibly cutting off resources
[2:38:45.600 --> 2:38:51.600]  to kill the majority of us, drugging our water supplies to sterilize us.
[2:38:51.600 --> 2:38:58.600]  I mean these people are Hitlerian, and as you know being a man of letters in history,
[2:38:58.600 --> 2:39:03.600]  that Hitler got his ideas from the eugenicists in England and the United States
[2:39:03.600 --> 2:39:08.600]  and that these are simply a bunch of little Hitlers masquerading as liberal bleeding hearts.
[2:39:08.600 --> 2:39:12.600]  They are murderous criminal control freaks.
[2:39:12.600 --> 2:39:14.600]  Well you put that even more strongly than I would.
[2:39:14.600 --> 2:39:22.600]  I think there is certainly an element of deliberate desire to control population
[2:39:22.600 --> 2:39:26.600]  by killing people in large numbers deliberately is necessary.
[2:39:26.600 --> 2:39:31.600]  I don't think they care about that as long as they're not among those who get killed.
[2:39:31.600 --> 2:39:36.600]  And I think we do have to try to persuade the third world countries when they go to Copenhagen
[2:39:36.600 --> 2:39:39.600]  that they should not sign this treaty.
[2:39:39.600 --> 2:39:44.600]  It's been very carefully tailored this treaty so that they think in the third world countries
[2:39:44.600 --> 2:39:49.600]  that they're going to make a lot of money out of it from the Western countries.
[2:39:49.600 --> 2:39:53.600]  And that's why they, many of them are going to say well you know maybe there is this climate problem,
[2:39:53.600 --> 2:39:56.600]  maybe there isn't, but if we're going to make some money out of it we'll pretend that there is.
[2:39:56.600 --> 2:40:01.600]  And of course that would be the most terrible thing for them to do
[2:40:01.600 --> 2:40:06.600]  because they will be the first victim of this policy of making the world poorer.
[2:40:06.600 --> 2:40:10.600]  If you make the rich poorer, then you make the poor poorer still
[2:40:10.600 --> 2:40:15.600]  and they will end up not just scratching around for a buried distance, they will be dying.
[2:40:15.600 --> 2:40:21.600]  That's already happening and anybody who really cares about his fellow man in the poorer countries
[2:40:21.600 --> 2:40:26.600]  must always oppose this nonsense about not burning fossil fuels.
[2:40:26.600 --> 2:40:31.600]  Fossil fuels are harmless, CO2 is a naturally occurring trace gas,
[2:40:31.600 --> 2:40:35.600]  and to take up your point about ocean acidification, which you've just mentioned,
[2:40:35.600 --> 2:40:37.600]  that's their fallback position.
[2:40:37.600 --> 2:40:41.600]  We've now had 15 years with no global warming.
[2:40:41.600 --> 2:40:47.600]  We've had nine years of rapid global cooling, though they've been doing their best to conceal that.
[2:40:47.600 --> 2:40:51.600]  In public they've been saying, oh, but eight of the last 10 years or 10 of the last 12 years
[2:40:51.600 --> 2:40:56.600]  have been the warmest on the record without telling us the record only goes back 150 years.
[2:40:56.600 --> 2:41:01.600]  But then they say internally, oh look, you know, Moncton is right,
[2:41:01.600 --> 2:41:05.600]  the temperatures really have been falling for nine years and we can't explain it
[2:41:05.600 --> 2:41:07.600]  and what a travesty that is.
[2:41:07.600 --> 2:41:09.600]  So publicly they're saying the science is settled,
[2:41:09.600 --> 2:41:13.600]  you're all doomed unless you close down the economies of the West,
[2:41:13.600 --> 2:41:17.600]  whereas privately they're saying to each other, we've got it wrong, that none of this adds up
[2:41:17.600 --> 2:41:19.600]  and it's a travesty that we can't explain it.
[2:41:19.600 --> 2:41:22.600]  And so they now say ocean acidification is the problem.
[2:41:22.600 --> 2:41:24.600]  No, it isn't.
[2:41:24.600 --> 2:41:29.600]  There has been 20 times as much CO2 in the atmosphere as there is today.
[2:41:29.600 --> 2:41:33.600]  Let us go back, say, to the Cambrian era, 550 million years ago.
[2:41:33.600 --> 2:41:35.600]  Ah, yes, I remember it well.
[2:41:35.600 --> 2:41:39.600]  At that time, 20 times as much CO2 in the atmosphere as there is today.
[2:41:39.600 --> 2:41:44.600]  And that was the time when the calcite corals first came into existence.
[2:41:44.600 --> 2:41:49.600]  So all this bedwetting nonsense about the corals dissolving in 20 years,
[2:41:49.600 --> 2:41:52.600]  as Al Gore had been saying, because of ocean acidification,
[2:41:52.600 --> 2:41:55.600]  there is no scientific basis for that at all.
[2:41:55.600 --> 2:42:02.600]  It physically can't happen because CO2 is only ranked seventh in the substances in the sea
[2:42:02.600 --> 2:42:05.600]  that could in theory affect the acid-base balance,
[2:42:05.600 --> 2:42:10.600]  but it in fact serves a role as the pivot or hinge around which all the others operate.
[2:42:10.600 --> 2:42:13.600]  And you can add as much CO2 to the ocean as you like,
[2:42:13.600 --> 2:42:17.600]  and it simply wouldn't make any difference to the acid-base balance.
[2:42:17.600 --> 2:42:18.600]  The whole thing is nonsense.
[2:42:18.600 --> 2:42:22.600]  Lord Moncton, going through a bunch of subjects,
[2:42:22.600 --> 2:42:26.600]  I want to play a clip in a moment of Herman Van Rompuy,
[2:42:26.600 --> 2:42:30.600]  the new EU head of this expanded dictatorial EU.
[2:42:30.600 --> 2:42:33.600]  I'd like to talk about the nature of the world government,
[2:42:33.600 --> 2:42:36.600]  some liberals say, oh, a wonderful world government, peace, peace.
[2:42:36.600 --> 2:42:40.600]  This, as you say, is a dictatorial group of control freaks,
[2:42:40.600 --> 2:42:42.600]  the type of world they want to build.
[2:42:42.600 --> 2:42:44.600]  But is this not the Achilles' heel?
[2:42:44.600 --> 2:42:48.600]  Because if we have Van Rompuy, and if we have Bandkai Moon, the head of the UN,
[2:42:48.600 --> 2:42:53.600]  and all of these top neural-order globalists saying the global carbon tax,
[2:42:53.600 --> 2:42:59.600]  environmental, neo-futalistic surf system is the key to our world government,
[2:42:59.600 --> 2:43:06.600]  exposing then their carbon tax as a fraud will kill 30 years of a program
[2:43:06.600 --> 2:43:08.600]  they've been building in the background.
[2:43:08.600 --> 2:43:13.600]  And why do you think they're now coming out of the closet and admitting world government?
[2:43:13.600 --> 2:43:17.600]  I think they're admitting it simply because they were caught out.
[2:43:17.600 --> 2:43:23.600]  There's no doubt that they had hoped that that treaty would stay on the website,
[2:43:23.600 --> 2:43:25.600]  and they hoped that nobody would see it.
[2:43:25.600 --> 2:43:29.600]  But they wanted to put it there so that they couldn't be accused afterwards
[2:43:29.600 --> 2:43:32.600]  of not having let the public know what they were going to do.
[2:43:32.600 --> 2:43:34.600]  That's why they did that.
[2:43:34.600 --> 2:43:36.600]  And I happened to find out about it.
[2:43:36.600 --> 2:43:39.600]  I then, first of all, got it in the National Press in Canada,
[2:43:39.600 --> 2:43:41.600]  all over the front page of the National Post.
[2:43:41.600 --> 2:43:45.600]  Then I went to the states, I did the same there, with a speech in four-minute photo
[2:43:45.600 --> 2:43:49.600]  where somebody filmed the peroration at just four minutes, put it up on the web,
[2:43:49.600 --> 2:43:52.600]  and four million people have seen that now.
[2:43:52.600 --> 2:43:55.600]  And I think what has happened is we've panicked them.
[2:43:55.600 --> 2:43:59.600]  And so now they're coming out, trying to reassure us that global government
[2:43:59.600 --> 2:44:01.600]  isn't such a bad idea after all.
[2:44:01.600 --> 2:44:03.600]  Previously, they weren't going to tell us about this.
[2:44:03.600 --> 2:44:05.600]  They were going to put that treaty in place.
[2:44:05.600 --> 2:44:08.600]  And then we would suddenly wake up and found we were ruled by some ghastly group
[2:44:08.600 --> 2:44:10.600]  of little hipsters in Geneva or somewhere,
[2:44:10.600 --> 2:44:13.600]  and that none of our democratically elected governments could do anything about it.
[2:44:13.600 --> 2:44:17.600]  We know what it feels like in the UK because that's what they did to us with the EU.
[2:44:17.600 --> 2:44:20.600]  They told us it was just going to be a free trade area,
[2:44:20.600 --> 2:44:22.600]  and it turned into a bureaucratic monster.
[2:44:22.600 --> 2:44:26.600]  I was talking, in fact, to the past president of the EU, a wonderful man
[2:44:26.600 --> 2:44:28.600]  who is the president of the Czech Republic.
[2:44:28.600 --> 2:44:30.600]  Perhaps we'll have a class about this in Washington the other day.
[2:44:30.600 --> 2:44:33.600]  We were attending a conference together on the climate,
[2:44:33.600 --> 2:44:36.600]  organized by the Washington Times, and he made a wonderful speech there.
[2:44:36.600 --> 2:44:41.600]  And I asked him, I said, look, doesn't the whole arrangement at Copenhagen,
[2:44:41.600 --> 2:44:43.600]  this treaty that they're proposing to put in place,
[2:44:43.600 --> 2:44:48.600]  doesn't it look very much like a reinvention of communism to you?
[2:44:48.600 --> 2:44:53.600]  And he stopped and thought, and this is a man who presided over the collapse
[2:44:53.600 --> 2:44:55.600]  of communism in his country.
[2:44:55.600 --> 2:44:59.600]  He brought it to freedom and was its second president after he won that freedom.
[2:44:59.600 --> 2:45:04.600]  So he really knows what it is like to be on the wrong end of the extreme left and communism.
[2:45:04.600 --> 2:45:07.600]  And he thought for a moment, and he said, well, okay,
[2:45:07.600 --> 2:45:12.600]  so we can't yet say that it's going to be as brutal as communism was.
[2:45:12.600 --> 2:45:18.600]  But he said, apart from that, the similarities between communism and this treaty
[2:45:18.600 --> 2:45:21.600]  are far too many and far too close for comfort.
[2:45:21.600 --> 2:45:23.600]  I thought that was a very good answer.
[2:45:23.600 --> 2:45:28.600]  Well, sir, I mean, how can we not look at the police states being erected
[2:45:28.600 --> 2:45:31.600]  across the Western world, the surveillance, the citizen spies,
[2:45:31.600 --> 2:45:36.600]  British parents having to get a license to go to a public playground with their children,
[2:45:36.600 --> 2:45:41.600]  warrantless DNA checkpoints here in the United States.
[2:45:41.600 --> 2:45:48.600]  I mean, clearly, we see a world government forming by the bureaucracy
[2:45:48.600 --> 2:45:50.600]  that is to be enforced at the barrel of a gun.
[2:45:50.600 --> 2:45:55.600]  Well, I'll tell you what I think we can do about it, because I think we now need to organize.
[2:45:55.600 --> 2:46:03.600]  And I think what we need to do is to form the first worldwide political party.
[2:46:03.600 --> 2:46:08.600]  And this worldwide political party, which will operate and fight elections in every country,
[2:46:08.600 --> 2:46:11.600]  will simply be called the Freedom Party.
[2:46:11.600 --> 2:46:17.600]  And it will fight this international, creeping, communist bureaucracy,
[2:46:17.600 --> 2:46:23.600]  wherever it finds it, and it will stand up for freedom and its two handmaid
[2:46:23.600 --> 2:46:25.600]  and democracy and prosperity.
[2:46:25.600 --> 2:46:32.600]  And every time these people try to take it away, we in the Freedom Party will stop them.
[2:46:32.600 --> 2:46:34.600]  And I think that now is the time.
[2:46:34.600 --> 2:46:39.600]  I think people are all over the world absolutely fed up to the back teeth
[2:46:39.600 --> 2:46:44.600]  with the bureaucratic political class lauding it over them in this way,
[2:46:44.600 --> 2:46:49.600]  in a way far more intrusive than anything the aristocracy of old used to be, or even could do.
[2:46:49.600 --> 2:46:53.600]  They're using all the weapons, as you rightly say, of modern surveillance.
[2:46:53.600 --> 2:47:01.600]  We have more cameras snooping over the British people than in all the other countries of Europe,
[2:47:01.600 --> 2:47:05.600]  as I did together. This is a real police state here.
[2:47:05.600 --> 2:47:09.600]  Now, I can't get onto the BBC to say what I've said to you.
[2:47:09.600 --> 2:47:12.600]  They rang up yesterday and invited me to go on the air,
[2:47:12.600 --> 2:47:15.600]  and then within five minutes they'd rang up and cancelled.
[2:47:15.600 --> 2:47:20.600]  And the reason why was I was going to go on to debate with the leader of the Green Party.
[2:47:20.600 --> 2:47:23.600]  And the moment she heard I was coming, she said to the BBC,
[2:47:23.600 --> 2:47:26.600]  don't let him on because he'll beat me if he comes on.
[2:47:26.600 --> 2:47:30.600]  Let me go on my own because I'll say what you, the BBC, want me to say.
[2:47:30.600 --> 2:47:33.600]  And so they cancelled, not me, the one who was willing to debate,
[2:47:33.600 --> 2:47:37.600]  but her, the one that wasn't. They cancelled me, and they let her go on.
[2:47:37.600 --> 2:47:38.600]  That's how it now is.
[2:47:38.600 --> 2:47:41.600]  Isn't this a form of...
[2:47:41.600 --> 2:47:43.600]  Our subservient to the government.
[2:47:43.600 --> 2:47:47.600]  Well, the BBC still, that I've seen, won't report on the email gate,
[2:47:47.600 --> 2:47:53.600]  and as you know and reported, sir, they got these five weeks before and refused to publish them.
[2:47:53.600 --> 2:47:57.600]  That is another horrifying story, because in the old days,
[2:47:57.600 --> 2:48:00.600]  if you were a journalist and some news came your way,
[2:48:00.600 --> 2:48:03.600]  even if it was news that you didn't agree with politically,
[2:48:03.600 --> 2:48:06.600]  you knew what news was, you reported it.
[2:48:06.600 --> 2:48:08.600]  You could add caveat that maybe it was stolen,
[2:48:08.600 --> 2:48:10.600]  you could add caveat that maybe you didn't approve of it,
[2:48:10.600 --> 2:48:12.600]  but you still reported it.
[2:48:12.600 --> 2:48:17.600]  The BBC is now so politicised, so utterly the creature
[2:48:17.600 --> 2:48:21.600]  of the communistic bureaucratic class that now runs the whole of Europe,
[2:48:21.600 --> 2:48:23.600]  whether our elected government like it or not,
[2:48:23.600 --> 2:48:26.600]  and far too many of them do like it or that,
[2:48:26.600 --> 2:48:30.600]  we no longer have free speech on the air in this country.
[2:48:30.600 --> 2:48:33.600]  And most of the newspapers won't touch it either.
[2:48:33.600 --> 2:48:37.600]  There's only been two newspapers here that have really reported in any debt
[2:48:37.600 --> 2:48:39.600]  what is in these emails.
[2:48:39.600 --> 2:48:42.600]  The rest of them have loftily remained,
[2:48:42.600 --> 2:48:46.600]  they're still wittering on about how the global warming will spread malaria
[2:48:46.600 --> 2:48:49.600]  or drown the Maldives or cause floods and drought,
[2:48:49.600 --> 2:48:53.600]  or melt the Arctic ice cap and make the poor polar bears suffer.
[2:48:53.600 --> 2:48:58.600]  There are five times as many polar bears now as there were 40 years ago,
[2:48:58.600 --> 2:49:02.600]  hardly as you may think the profile of a species in imminent threat of extinction.
[2:49:02.600 --> 2:49:07.600]  And Lord Moncton, as you say, that it's an official government number,
[2:49:07.600 --> 2:49:10.600]  they're all over the place,
[2:49:10.600 --> 2:49:14.600]  and I have seen the last week since these emails got leaked
[2:49:14.600 --> 2:49:17.600]  an intensification of scientists coming out and saying,
[2:49:17.600 --> 2:49:19.600]  we're all dead, pass it now.
[2:49:19.600 --> 2:49:24.600]  It seems like they are panicking and a lot of people that were on the fence about this
[2:49:24.600 --> 2:49:29.600]  are really starting to wake up because of the ridiculous alarmist statements
[2:49:29.600 --> 2:49:32.600]  by Al Gore and others.
[2:49:32.600 --> 2:49:36.600]  I think that is definitely now the stink of desperation
[2:49:36.600 --> 2:49:40.600]  in the alarmist shrieking noises that we're hearing.
[2:49:40.600 --> 2:49:44.600]  They know they've been rumbled, they know they've been found out,
[2:49:44.600 --> 2:49:48.600]  they know the Bunko Booth is about to be closed down
[2:49:48.600 --> 2:49:51.600]  and their little scam, in fact, rather a large scam,
[2:49:51.600 --> 2:49:53.600]  is no longer going to go any further.
[2:49:53.600 --> 2:49:59.600]  And they are absolutely desperate to try to force this treaty through in Copenhagen.
[2:49:59.600 --> 2:50:05.600]  They're going to try to make sure that Obama never reads about the emails from the climate research unit.
[2:50:05.600 --> 2:50:08.600]  You know, they have so many other things to read, these heads of state.
[2:50:08.600 --> 2:50:10.600]  If the bureaucrats don't want them to know about something,
[2:50:10.600 --> 2:50:12.600]  they can make sure they don't find out about it.
[2:50:12.600 --> 2:50:16.600]  And Obama probably doesn't even know these emails have happened.
[2:50:16.600 --> 2:50:18.600]  Even if he does know, I don't think he would care,
[2:50:18.600 --> 2:50:20.600]  but I don't think they will have even told it.
[2:50:20.600 --> 2:50:23.600]  Because he wants to be able to have plausible denibulity.
[2:50:23.600 --> 2:50:26.600]  Oh, gee, I never knew that when I went ahead and signed this treaty,
[2:50:26.600 --> 2:50:28.600]  which ended our Constitution.
[2:50:28.600 --> 2:50:30.600]  Plausible denibulity.
[2:50:30.600 --> 2:50:32.600]  May I quote Jefferson to you?
[2:50:32.600 --> 2:50:33.600]  Yes, sir.
[2:50:33.600 --> 2:50:36.600]  He is the founder of Obama's party, the founder of the Democrat party,
[2:50:36.600 --> 2:50:38.600]  and this is what he said.
[2:50:38.600 --> 2:50:42.600]  He said, I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility
[2:50:42.600 --> 2:50:45.600]  against every tyranny over the mind of man.
[2:50:45.600 --> 2:50:48.600]  Now what we're faced with is a tyranny worldwide
[2:50:48.600 --> 2:50:51.600]  over the mind and body of man.
[2:50:51.600 --> 2:50:55.600]  And it is the duty of every red-blooded United States citizen
[2:50:55.600 --> 2:50:58.600]  to oppose with every fiber of his being
[2:50:58.600 --> 2:51:01.600]  what is being done in his name by this administration
[2:51:01.600 --> 2:51:05.600]  to try to sign away your Constitution at Copenhagen.
[2:51:05.600 --> 2:51:08.600]  I went onto the Hill recently, and I went to see
[2:51:08.600 --> 2:51:10.600]  one of your greatest constitutional experts.
[2:51:10.600 --> 2:51:12.600]  He's a young lawyer.
[2:51:12.600 --> 2:51:15.600]  All you can see in his office is piles of books everywhere.
[2:51:15.600 --> 2:51:18.600]  And he sat me down on a pile of books as it happened.
[2:51:18.600 --> 2:51:21.600]  And even before I'd sat down, he said,
[2:51:21.600 --> 2:51:25.600]  this treaty trumped the United States Constitution.
[2:51:25.600 --> 2:51:29.600]  This, he said, will be the end of the United States, as we know it.
[2:51:29.600 --> 2:51:33.600]  That is how close your country is going to come to being extinguished.
[2:51:33.600 --> 2:51:37.600]  Ours has largely already gone because the European commissars,
[2:51:37.600 --> 2:51:40.600]  whom we don't elect, now make 90% of our laws.
[2:51:40.600 --> 2:51:43.600]  But I don't want to see the beacon of freedom
[2:51:43.600 --> 2:51:45.600]  to the rest of the world, is what the United States is.
[2:51:45.600 --> 2:51:48.600]  I don't want to see the United States going the same way.
[2:51:48.600 --> 2:51:51.600]  So if you are listening to this radio station,
[2:51:51.600 --> 2:51:55.600]  then get off your bottom, get out of that lounger,
[2:51:55.600 --> 2:51:57.600]  get a pen and paper,
[2:51:57.600 --> 2:52:00.600]  get hold of the number of the U.S. Senate,
[2:52:00.600 --> 2:52:02.600]  and ring the U.S. Senate,
[2:52:02.600 --> 2:52:04.600]  and ask to speak to both of your senators.
[2:52:04.600 --> 2:52:08.600]  Do not be fobbed off with an intern or a secretary.
[2:52:08.600 --> 2:52:11.600]  Make sure you speak to a senior staffer, at least,
[2:52:11.600 --> 2:52:13.600]  the senator himself if possible,
[2:52:13.600 --> 2:52:18.600]  and make it known that the Treaty of Copenhagen shall not pass.
[2:52:18.600 --> 2:52:21.600]  That's what you can do in the week that you have remaining
[2:52:21.600 --> 2:52:24.600]  to save your country and its democracy,
[2:52:24.600 --> 2:52:27.600]  and the world's freedom that depends on your democracy.
[2:52:27.600 --> 2:52:30.600]  Well said, Lord Mokton. Absolutely incredible.
[2:52:30.600 --> 2:52:32.600]  Again, you're a godsend at the time.
[2:52:32.600 --> 2:52:35.600]  You exploded on the scene after years of speaking out.
[2:52:35.600 --> 2:52:39.600]  It caught fire in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[2:52:39.600 --> 2:52:41.600]  Then these emails and documents,
[2:52:41.600 --> 2:52:44.600]  the code coming out where there's notes by the programmers,
[2:52:44.600 --> 2:52:47.600]  how to engage in fraud, the notes about persecution,
[2:52:47.600 --> 2:52:50.600]  emails with John P. Holdren in there,
[2:52:50.600 --> 2:52:52.600]  and all this news in the times of London,
[2:52:52.600 --> 2:52:55.600]  billionaire club and bid to curb overpopulation,
[2:52:55.600 --> 2:52:57.600]  secret meetings by the elites,
[2:52:57.600 --> 2:52:59.600]  and that's my next question for you, sir,
[2:52:59.600 --> 2:53:01.600]  and the time we have left.
[2:53:01.600 --> 2:53:03.600]  I mean, you've worked at the highest levels
[2:53:03.600 --> 2:53:05.600]  of the British government for 10 Downing Street
[2:53:05.600 --> 2:53:07.600]  as a top advisor to Margaret Thatcher.
[2:53:07.600 --> 2:53:11.600]  You're a high-level lord in the House of Lords.
[2:53:11.600 --> 2:53:13.600]  You have a great old British family behind you.
[2:53:13.600 --> 2:53:15.600]  You know a lot of the elites.
[2:53:15.600 --> 2:53:18.600]  What is the real split in the power structure?
[2:53:18.600 --> 2:53:21.600]  Because we know the socialist, communist, globalists
[2:53:21.600 --> 2:53:24.600]  don't have full control yet. They're trying to get it now.
[2:53:24.600 --> 2:53:26.600]  What is the real power structure?
[2:53:26.600 --> 2:53:28.600]  Because we see George Soros.
[2:53:28.600 --> 2:53:32.600]  We see a lot of other big, rich billionaires
[2:53:32.600 --> 2:53:36.600]  the Rockefellers behind this man-made climate change,
[2:53:36.600 --> 2:53:38.600]  global government move.
[2:53:38.600 --> 2:53:41.600]  I mean, bottom line, who are these people to humanity?
[2:53:41.600 --> 2:53:43.600]  Who are they to you?
[2:53:43.600 --> 2:53:46.600]  Who are the real enemies of humanity?
[2:53:46.600 --> 2:53:51.600]  The enemies of humanity are those who think that they know best
[2:53:51.600 --> 2:53:54.600]  what's good for you, the little guy.
[2:53:54.600 --> 2:53:56.600]  You and me, the little guy.
[2:53:56.600 --> 2:53:59.600]  They think they know best what is good for us.
[2:53:59.600 --> 2:54:04.600]  Anybody who has that attitude does not deserve to hold a high office
[2:54:04.600 --> 2:54:06.600]  but all too often they do.
[2:54:06.600 --> 2:54:10.600]  And it is very important to understand how arrogant these people are.
[2:54:10.600 --> 2:54:12.600]  But there is always hope.
[2:54:12.600 --> 2:54:16.600]  Because although money, such as that which George Soros has
[2:54:16.600 --> 2:54:19.600]  or Bill Gates of Microsoft, any of these people who have,
[2:54:19.600 --> 2:54:23.600]  in one way or another, indicated their belief in the global warming nonsense,
[2:54:23.600 --> 2:54:27.600]  although money buys you power,
[2:54:27.600 --> 2:54:33.600]  it doesn't buy you the long-term influence by which alone humankind advances.
[2:54:33.600 --> 2:54:39.600]  And that is governed entirely by those who generate ideas.
[2:54:39.600 --> 2:54:43.600]  And that is something which people who simply want power for themselves
[2:54:43.600 --> 2:54:45.600]  are very seldom capable of doing.
[2:54:45.600 --> 2:54:50.600]  And so in the end, I'm not frightened that we have communism,
[2:54:50.600 --> 2:54:53.600]  if you like, re-emerging from behind the Berlin Wall
[2:54:53.600 --> 2:54:56.600]  and now spreading into every aspect of every Western democracy's life.
[2:54:56.600 --> 2:54:58.600]  Because of course that's what's happening.
[2:54:58.600 --> 2:55:05.600]  The extreme left, when they burst into tears as they saw their cherished Berlin Wall coming down
[2:55:05.600 --> 2:55:09.600]  and they realized that freedom was going to spread into Eastern Europe
[2:55:09.600 --> 2:55:10.600]  whether they liked it or not.
[2:55:10.600 --> 2:55:12.600]  And my goodness, they did not like it.
[2:55:12.600 --> 2:55:14.600]  They're the people of Eastern Europe.
[2:55:14.600 --> 2:55:16.600]  The control freak kingdom was in trouble.
[2:55:16.600 --> 2:55:19.600]  They moved in to the Green Movement and took it over.
[2:55:19.600 --> 2:55:22.600]  I have a friend, Eric Ellington, who was one of the founders of Greenpeace.
[2:55:22.600 --> 2:55:26.600]  And he said, within a year or two, I had to leave and so many of us did who had founded it
[2:55:26.600 --> 2:55:30.600]  because it had become taken over by Marxist entries
[2:55:30.600 --> 2:55:33.600]  who had seen the Green Environmental Movement
[2:55:33.600 --> 2:55:37.600]  as a way of destroying the economies of the West from within
[2:55:37.600 --> 2:55:40.600]  by fooling us to shut our own economies down.
[2:55:40.600 --> 2:55:42.600]  And he said that to me many years ago.
[2:55:42.600 --> 2:55:44.600]  He said, I had to give up and come out.
[2:55:44.600 --> 2:55:48.600]  And that was long before they became as nakedly obvious.
[2:55:48.600 --> 2:55:53.600]  Yes, we should point out what you've been fighting. You've been fighting these people for 15 years, haven't you?
[2:55:53.600 --> 2:55:56.600]  I've been fighting them ever since I first worked for Margaret Thatcher
[2:55:56.600 --> 2:55:59.600]  because they were, at that time, in the Kremlin.
[2:55:59.600 --> 2:56:06.600]  They were buying our miners' union support for a strike against the elected government of Britain.
[2:56:06.600 --> 2:56:12.600]  And they had spent 20 million pounds, which in today's money is about 200 million dollars,
[2:56:12.600 --> 2:56:17.600]  subsidizing the Marxist faction within our mine workers' union.
[2:56:17.600 --> 2:56:21.600]  To try to disrupt Britain by a series of crippling strikes.
[2:56:21.600 --> 2:56:24.600]  So you learned about them then. We're almost out of time. I'm sorry for interrupting.
[2:56:24.600 --> 2:56:29.600]  But now Russia's coming out against the global warming tax.
[2:56:29.600 --> 2:56:31.600]  It's almost like things are upside down.
[2:56:31.600 --> 2:56:34.600]  We're the USSR and they're not perfect.
[2:56:34.600 --> 2:56:36.600]  But what's your take on Russia?
[2:56:36.600 --> 2:56:41.600]  Well, they are now 20 times more democratic than the European Union is.
[2:56:41.600 --> 2:56:44.600]  Of course, you tend to vote at the point of a gun.
[2:56:44.600 --> 2:56:48.600]  You tend to have only limited choice of candidates and a lot of corruption.
[2:56:48.600 --> 2:56:53.600]  But their elected parliament, insofar as it is elected, makes the laws for Russia.
[2:56:53.600 --> 2:56:56.600]  Our elected parliament no longer makes the laws for us.
[2:56:56.600 --> 2:56:59.600]  That's done for us by the Commissar, whom we don't elect.
[2:56:59.600 --> 2:57:03.600]  So Russia is now more democratic than Britain. I hate to say it.
[2:57:03.600 --> 2:57:07.600]  But America is more democratic than almost anywhere else in the world.
[2:57:07.600 --> 2:57:13.600]  And I beg you, Alex, I beg you, do not allow America to give up her democracy
[2:57:13.600 --> 2:57:19.600]  for this mess of socialist global warming porridge and potage at Copenhagen.
[2:57:19.600 --> 2:57:22.600]  Don't allow your freedom to be taken away.
[2:57:22.600 --> 2:57:27.600]  Lord Moncton, I know it is a Friday evening where you are.
[2:57:27.600 --> 2:57:30.600]  And I'd like to say bye to you here during the break if you must leave.
[2:57:30.600 --> 2:57:32.600]  If not, we have five minute little short segment coming up.
[2:57:32.600 --> 2:57:34.600]  We can have five more minutes.
[2:57:34.600 --> 2:57:37.600]  I'd like to come back, give you the floor with a final statement,
[2:57:37.600 --> 2:57:39.600]  or you can do it the minute we have right now,
[2:57:39.600 --> 2:57:43.600]  about seizing on these emails which is now happening
[2:57:43.600 --> 2:57:47.600]  and really standing up for this battle
[2:57:47.600 --> 2:57:53.600]  and making sure that we get back on the offense instead of the defense.
[2:57:53.600 --> 2:57:57.600]  Because as you said, this is two minutes to midnight.
[2:57:57.600 --> 2:57:59.600]  It is. It's even later than that.
[2:57:59.600 --> 2:58:02.600]  I mean, we're really in the last second before freedom died.
[2:58:02.600 --> 2:58:06.600]  And you must, you must, you must not let it happen.
[2:58:06.600 --> 2:58:09.600]  If you're listening to this, you may think, you may think,
[2:58:09.600 --> 2:58:11.600]  who is this lunatic peer?
[2:58:11.600 --> 2:58:13.600]  What does he know about anything?
[2:58:13.600 --> 2:58:15.600]  Isn't he just some kind of right-wing extremist nutter
[2:58:15.600 --> 2:58:17.600]  after all he worked for Margaret Thatcher.
[2:58:17.600 --> 2:58:18.600]  We all know what she was like.
[2:58:18.600 --> 2:58:19.600]  Well, she was wonderful.
[2:58:19.600 --> 2:58:22.600]  And she understood how ordinary people thought and lived
[2:58:22.600 --> 2:58:24.600]  and wanted to control their own affairs.
[2:58:24.600 --> 2:58:26.600]  And that's what I'm about too.
[2:58:26.600 --> 2:58:29.600]  I think that freedom and democracy and prosperity
[2:58:29.600 --> 2:58:32.600]  are very, very, very precious rights
[2:58:32.600 --> 2:58:34.600]  that we have been able to look at as rights,
[2:58:34.600 --> 2:58:36.600]  but they're not rights.
[2:58:36.600 --> 2:58:38.600]  They have to be fought for by each new generation.
[2:58:38.600 --> 2:58:40.600]  Stay there, sir. Stay there.
[2:58:40.600 --> 2:58:42.600]  They will take it away.
[2:58:42.600 --> 2:58:44.600]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[2:58:44.600 --> 2:59:13.600]  Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[2:59:14.600 --> 2:59:17.600]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy,
[2:59:17.600 --> 2:59:20.600]  and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[2:59:20.600 --> 2:59:22.600]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[2:59:22.600 --> 2:59:24.600]  You need to look out for yourself.
[2:59:24.600 --> 2:59:26.600]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[2:59:26.600 --> 2:59:28.600]  You must prepare and make sure you are able
[2:59:28.600 --> 2:59:31.600]  to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[2:59:31.600 --> 2:59:34.600]  Go to here'swhatyoudo.net and start today.
[2:59:34.600 --> 2:59:37.600]  Again, it is here's what you do.net.
[2:59:37.600 --> 2:59:39.600]  That's here's what you do.net.
[2:59:39.600 --> 2:59:42.600]  One last time, it's here's what you do.net.
[2:59:42.600 --> 2:59:45.600]  One last time, it's here's what you do.net.
[3:00:12.600 --> 3:00:14.600]  He's waiting to have dinner with his lovely wives.
[3:00:14.600 --> 3:00:18.600]  We're going to keep Lord Moncton another four and a half minutes.
[3:00:18.600 --> 3:00:23.600]  His website is scienceandpublicpolicy.org.
[3:00:23.600 --> 3:00:25.600]  Our websites are, of course, infowars.com
[3:00:25.600 --> 3:00:27.600]  and prisonplanet.com.
[3:00:27.600 --> 3:00:30.600]  And I cover the global green takeover in my film
[3:00:30.600 --> 3:00:33.600]  Fall of the Republic free on YouTube and Google.
[3:00:33.600 --> 3:00:36.600]  Millions and millions of views in this and the Obama deception.
[3:00:36.600 --> 3:00:38.600]  Show it to everyone you know.
[3:00:38.600 --> 3:00:40.600]  Just because you are awakened aware doesn't mean
[3:00:40.600 --> 3:00:43.600]  your friends and family are and people are now ready to hear the truth.
[3:00:43.600 --> 3:00:45.600]  In the last four minutes that we have left, sir,
[3:00:45.600 --> 3:00:49.600]  you have the floor recapping, climate gate, where we go,
[3:00:49.600 --> 3:00:51.600]  Copenhagen, the nature of these people.
[3:00:51.600 --> 3:00:55.600]  Lord Christopher Moncton.
[3:00:55.600 --> 3:00:57.600]  Science, very briefly.
[3:00:57.600 --> 3:01:02.600]  We now know by direct measurement that these consensus computer models,
[3:01:02.600 --> 3:01:07.600]  all of which had been tuned deliberately, as we now know from the East Anglia one,
[3:01:07.600 --> 3:01:11.600]  to show and save and demonstrate the same results.
[3:01:11.600 --> 3:01:13.600]  These models are all wrong.
[3:01:13.600 --> 3:01:17.600]  The outgoing radiation that was supposed to be trapped by the greenhouse gases down here,
[3:01:17.600 --> 3:01:20.600]  so it wasn't getting out to space, is getting out to space.
[3:01:20.600 --> 3:01:22.600]  We've measured it from a satellite for 20 years.
[3:01:22.600 --> 3:01:25.600]  It's getting out to space just as much as it always did.
[3:01:25.600 --> 3:01:29.600]  And so the warming effect of extra CO2 is tiny.
[3:01:29.600 --> 3:01:32.600]  You're looking at maybe a quarter to half a Celsius degree
[3:01:32.600 --> 3:01:34.600]  over the whole of the next 100 years.
[3:01:34.600 --> 3:01:37.600]  That's the science, and that's by measurement.
[3:01:37.600 --> 3:01:39.600]  That's not a question of consensus.
[3:01:39.600 --> 3:01:43.600]  It's a straightforward measurement, and the consensus has been proven wrong
[3:01:43.600 --> 3:01:47.600]  in a paper published by Professor Lyndon just a couple of months ago.
[3:01:47.600 --> 3:01:51.600]  We also now know that even if there were a problem,
[3:01:51.600 --> 3:01:55.600]  nothing we can do about it, because we're only emitting enough
[3:01:55.600 --> 3:01:58.600]  to put up the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere
[3:01:58.600 --> 3:02:02.600]  by two parts per million of the whole atmosphere every year.
[3:02:02.600 --> 3:02:07.600]  That's enough to cause, even on the UN's exaggerated estimate of CO2's warming effect,
[3:02:07.600 --> 3:02:15.600]  that will only cause less than one-twenty-fifth of a Fahrenheit degree of warming per year.
[3:02:15.600 --> 3:02:18.600]  So all those people who say we've got to save the planet immediately
[3:02:18.600 --> 3:02:21.600]  or we're doomed in 10 years, it's rubbish.
[3:02:21.600 --> 3:02:25.600]  Even if the UN were right, which we now know by measurement, it isn't.
[3:02:25.600 --> 3:02:31.600]  There's nothing we can do about it short of closing down the entire world economy permanently.
[3:02:31.600 --> 3:02:37.600]  And so there's no point in taking any steps whatsoever to mitigate CO2.
[3:02:37.600 --> 3:02:41.600]  It's far better to adapt to any change in climate, whichever way it goes,
[3:02:41.600 --> 3:02:44.600]  and it's going to be 50-50 whether it gets warmer or cooler from now on,
[3:02:44.600 --> 3:02:46.600]  even if we do nothing.
[3:02:46.600 --> 3:02:51.600]  And the correct policy to deal with the non-problem that is climate change
[3:02:51.600 --> 3:02:59.600]  is to have the courage to do nothing, except to prosecute and indict and imprison for a very long time.
[3:02:59.600 --> 3:03:05.600]  The fraudsters and racketeers from Al Gore to the people of the University of East Anglia
[3:03:05.600 --> 3:03:11.600]  who have been making their fortune at the expense of taxpayers and the little guy
[3:03:11.600 --> 3:03:15.600]  paying extra for his electricity to pay for all these useless windmills.
[3:03:15.600 --> 3:03:19.600]  We, the people, have now got to rise up worldwide,
[3:03:19.600 --> 3:03:23.600]  found a party which stands in every country for freedom,
[3:03:23.600 --> 3:03:32.600]  and make sure that we fight this bureaucratic, communistic, world government monster to a standstill.
[3:03:32.600 --> 3:03:35.600]  They shall not part.
[3:03:35.600 --> 3:03:39.600]  Lord Christopher Moncton, in the minute and a half we have left,
[3:03:39.600 --> 3:03:42.600]  it is a godsend your work for the last 20 years fighting these people.
[3:03:42.600 --> 3:03:44.600]  It's a godsend what Ron Paul's been doing.
[3:03:44.600 --> 3:03:48.600]  So many others are now speaking out against this tyranny,
[3:03:48.600 --> 3:03:52.600]  and we're now seeing that we can have victories against these people if we stand up,
[3:03:52.600 --> 3:03:55.600]  but this is the key juncture with Copenhagen.
[3:03:55.600 --> 3:03:58.600]  We must do everything we can, calling into local talk shows, letters to the editor,
[3:03:58.600 --> 3:04:02.600]  calling Congress, supporting you when you go to Copenhagen,
[3:04:02.600 --> 3:04:11.600]  because if we defeat them on this, does this not deal a substantive, perhaps even death blow to this global government tyranny?
[3:04:11.600 --> 3:04:16.600]  I think what we're going to have to do is to close down the United Nations.
[3:04:16.600 --> 3:04:20.600]  I was talking to a various senior former UN ambassador the other day in Canada,
[3:04:20.600 --> 3:04:23.600]  and he said to me, and I was quite surprised coming from him,
[3:04:23.600 --> 3:04:27.600]  he said, I no longer see any purpose in the UN,
[3:04:27.600 --> 3:04:32.600]  it exists only to enrich itself at the expense of the nations it claims to serve.
[3:04:32.600 --> 3:04:35.600]  It's time it was brought to an end.
[3:04:35.600 --> 3:04:41.600]  We would all say billion if we shut down the UN, and just about all of its hideous bureaucracy.
[3:04:41.600 --> 3:04:46.600]  And it's a criminal, it's a criminal menace, it must be dealt with, I agree, abolish it,
[3:04:46.600 --> 3:04:48.600]  arrest the criminals, charge them.
[3:04:48.600 --> 3:04:51.600]  Lord Christopher Monkton, thank you so much.
[3:04:51.600 --> 3:04:55.600]  Scienceofpublicpolicy.org, God bless you, Godspeed, we salute you.
[3:04:55.600 --> 3:04:57.600]  And God bless America.
[3:04:57.600 --> 3:04:59.600]  Take care, my friend, amazing interview.
[3:04:59.600 --> 3:05:01.600]  Thank you.
[3:05:01.600 --> 3:05:05.600]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[3:05:05.600 --> 3:05:08.600]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[3:05:08.600 --> 3:05:13.600]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[3:05:13.600 --> 3:05:19.600]  They've turned a menace influence on our president in Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[3:05:19.600 --> 3:05:24.600]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[3:05:24.600 --> 3:05:27.600]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[3:05:27.600 --> 3:05:32.600]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty,
[3:05:32.600 --> 3:05:34.600]  and on its ashes constructing world government.
[3:05:34.600 --> 3:05:38.600]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists, they're asking for more matches,
[3:05:38.600 --> 3:05:41.600]  and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[3:05:41.600 --> 3:05:43.600]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[3:05:43.600 --> 3:05:48.600]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[3:07:00.600 --> 3:07:03.600]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[3:07:03.600 --> 3:07:08.600]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[3:07:08.600 --> 3:07:14.600]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[3:07:14.600 --> 3:07:16.600]  Food is your only ammunition.
[3:07:16.600 --> 3:07:17.600]  How much do you want?
[3:07:17.600 --> 3:07:19.600]  Now or after the battle starts.
[3:07:19.600 --> 3:07:20.600]  When will you need it?
[3:07:20.600 --> 3:07:22.600]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[3:07:22.600 --> 3:07:24.600]  Will there be any food?
[3:07:24.600 --> 3:07:25.600]  Will it make your children sick?
[3:07:25.600 --> 3:07:30.600]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[3:07:30.600 --> 3:07:34.600]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[3:07:34.600 --> 3:07:38.600]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[3:07:38.600 --> 3:07:39.600]  How much will you need?
[3:07:39.600 --> 3:07:40.600]  We don't know.
[3:07:40.600 --> 3:07:41.600]  How much do you want?
[3:07:41.600 --> 3:07:42.600]  All you can get.
[3:07:42.600 --> 3:07:43.600]  I'm Alex Jones.
[3:07:43.600 --> 3:07:47.600]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[3:07:47.600 --> 3:07:54.600]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[3:07:54.600 --> 3:08:17.600]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[3:08:17.600 --> 3:08:27.600]  I came in because Jesse Ventura called up Wednesday and said, hey, I want to do your show Friday, give you the exclusive before I do a bunch of TV and radio next week.
[3:08:27.600 --> 3:08:33.600]  The new TV show that I consulted on and I appear in that's going to be airing live 10 p.m.
[3:08:33.600 --> 3:08:36.600]  Eastern Wednesday, December 3rd, 9 p.m. Central.
[3:08:36.600 --> 3:08:38.600]  Conspiracy theory.
[3:08:38.600 --> 3:08:40.600]  He's surprised it's even going to air.
[3:08:40.600 --> 3:08:41.600]  He's not even completely sure yet.
[3:08:41.600 --> 3:08:50.600]  And when we go to rebroadcast, when the show ends in 50 minutes, we're about to go to rebroadcast with Damon Vickers because I have family in town and I've got to go.
[3:08:50.600 --> 3:08:53.600]  But then when that ends, it was the live interview with Jesse Ventura.
[3:08:53.600 --> 3:08:54.600]  We did it at the start of the show.
[3:08:54.600 --> 3:08:55.600]  Amazing interview.
[3:08:55.600 --> 3:08:57.600]  Talked about stuff I've never heard him talk about.
[3:08:57.600 --> 3:08:59.600]  His dad, big war hero, and the rest of it.
[3:08:59.600 --> 3:09:00.600]  And the New World Order.
[3:09:00.600 --> 3:09:04.600]  And I convinced Jesse that globalism is bad period because he knows it's bad.
[3:09:04.600 --> 3:09:05.600]  He says, well, couldn't it be good?
[3:09:05.600 --> 3:09:07.600]  An amazing interview there.
[3:09:07.600 --> 3:09:11.600]  You're not going to believe the guests we've got coming up next week and the next two, three weeks.
[3:09:11.600 --> 3:09:16.600]  And I forgot that Dave Mustaine said when he was coming into Texas in November and December, he wanted to come in studio.
[3:09:16.600 --> 3:09:17.600]  I just remembered this.
[3:09:17.600 --> 3:09:20.600]  We're contacting him to get him on the next week, maybe too late.
[3:09:20.600 --> 3:09:22.600]  Regardless, we'll get him next time he comes through.
[3:09:22.600 --> 3:09:25.600]  He's a big fan, as you know, and he has a new album in game after my film in game.
[3:09:25.600 --> 3:09:26.600]  So we love Dave Mustaine.
[3:09:26.600 --> 3:09:28.600]  I always loved him, but I really love him more now.
[3:09:28.600 --> 3:09:32.600]  So that's going on with some other incredibly important informative guests.
[3:09:32.600 --> 3:09:35.600]  But I tell you, I've never been as excited.
[3:09:35.600 --> 3:09:42.600]  Charlie Sheen, by the way, is on Sunday as I am with this Lord Mockton because it's history happening.
[3:09:42.600 --> 3:09:44.600]  This guy, my instincts, everything.
[3:09:44.600 --> 3:09:46.600]  He's just, he's just good through and through.
[3:09:46.600 --> 3:09:48.600]  He's waking people up.
[3:09:48.600 --> 3:09:49.600]  He has huge gravitas.
[3:09:49.600 --> 3:09:57.600]  He's a high level peer closely related to Queen Elizabeth, but he's speaking out against the whole thing.
[3:09:57.600 --> 3:10:00.600]  And we're drawing blood.
[3:10:00.600 --> 3:10:03.600]  I mean, we're in a fight with the New World Order and we are starting to really kick their butt.
[3:10:03.600 --> 3:10:08.600]  And we're auditing the Fed now, the strong bill passed out a committee.
[3:10:08.600 --> 3:10:09.600]  They have a 311 votes.
[3:10:09.600 --> 3:10:11.600]  No way it's not going to pass the House.
[3:10:11.600 --> 3:10:12.600]  The Senate will probably kill it.
[3:10:12.600 --> 3:10:14.600]  But then everybody will say, why can't we audit?
[3:10:14.600 --> 3:10:15.600]  Why can't we audit?
[3:10:15.600 --> 3:10:16.600]  We'll get it next year or the year after.
[3:10:16.600 --> 3:10:18.600]  The momentum is all shifting.
[3:10:18.600 --> 3:10:21.600]  A primal shift is happening right now.
[3:10:21.600 --> 3:10:29.600]  And I can't believe the providence that I'm a central figure in this fight, getting to talk to people like Lord Mockton,
[3:10:29.600 --> 3:10:36.600]  getting to talk to people like Ron Paul, Dave Mustaine, you the listeners.
[3:10:36.600 --> 3:10:39.600]  And I know I loaded the phones up and haven't gone to them.
[3:10:39.600 --> 3:10:40.600]  I apologize.
[3:10:40.600 --> 3:10:44.600]  We'll be back live Sunday.
[3:10:44.600 --> 3:10:46.600]  It's just mind blowing to see all this happening.
[3:10:46.600 --> 3:10:48.600]  But the globalists have pulled the trigger.
[3:10:48.600 --> 3:10:50.600]  They've imploded the economy by design, their own documents.
[3:10:50.600 --> 3:10:52.600]  They admitted they're bringing in the global taxes.
[3:10:52.600 --> 3:10:54.600]  We told you they would in my films.
[3:10:54.600 --> 3:10:56.600]  I made a decade ago because we have their own plans.
[3:10:56.600 --> 3:10:57.600]  It's here.
[3:10:57.600 --> 3:10:58.600]  So we're going, yeah, we're waking up.
[3:10:58.600 --> 3:11:02.600]  We're fighting back, but they still already run over us with the tank.
[3:11:02.600 --> 3:11:12.600]  Now we got to get back up and go climb on top the tank and the info war with the information bomb and throw a hand grenade into it.
[3:11:12.600 --> 3:11:14.600]  And I mean, that is a peaceful analogy.
[3:11:14.600 --> 3:11:17.600]  The media will edit that together, but it doesn't matter.
[3:11:17.600 --> 3:11:20.600]  The point is we are in combat.
[3:11:20.600 --> 3:11:22.600]  This is, this is it.
[3:11:22.600 --> 3:11:25.600]  And we have to decide that justice be done.
[3:11:25.600 --> 3:11:26.600]  May the heavens fall.
[3:11:26.600 --> 3:11:29.600]  All that evil men in tiresy to flourish is that good men do nothing.
[3:11:29.600 --> 3:11:32.600]  I think that was another British Lord said that they pull up that quote.
[3:11:32.600 --> 3:11:34.600]  All that evil men in tiresy to flourish is that good men do nothing.
[3:11:34.600 --> 3:11:38.600]  I know George Washington repeated it and Thomas Jefferson changed it a bit.
[3:11:38.600 --> 3:11:45.600]  But all that evil men in tiresy to flourish is that good men and women do nothing and doesn't mean we're perfect.
[3:11:45.600 --> 3:11:50.600]  Doesn't mean we have all the answers, but we're in the fight here together.
[3:11:50.600 --> 3:11:56.600]  Now, before I go back to this Damon Vickers interview from a few weeks ago, it was so controversial.
[3:11:56.600 --> 3:11:59.600]  But I was just nice to him as we could hear what he really thought.
[3:11:59.600 --> 3:12:01.600]  I wasn't aware he was this bigger globalist.
[3:12:01.600 --> 3:12:02.600]  We're gonna have him back on by the way.
[3:12:02.600 --> 3:12:03.600]  This is a great illustration.
[3:12:03.600 --> 3:12:08.600]  I wanted to bring Ted Anderson up because yeah, it supports the network, but it's such a great deal.
[3:12:08.600 --> 3:12:19.600]  We have the dollar hits 14 year low against the yen, gold exploding in prices, Dubai and deep water, 18 billion, $14 billion default hitting British and US banks.
[3:12:19.600 --> 3:12:22.600]  This is the beginning of the end.
[3:12:22.600 --> 3:12:27.600]  Now we may defeat the new world order or they may take over, then we defeat them through that process.
[3:12:27.600 --> 3:12:30.600]  But the momentum is beginning to gather on our side.
[3:12:30.600 --> 3:12:35.600]  And knowing who the enemy is waking up to it is so important and then taking action.
[3:12:35.600 --> 3:12:45.600]  But I wanted to bring Ted up because he is running out of the gold he bought at the $1,050 level with it cresting a dollar or two below $1,200.
[3:12:45.600 --> 3:12:51.600]  So he's never had a deal where he's offering gold for $140 less.
[3:12:51.600 --> 3:12:55.600]  This deal he's been offering the last few days of this week is the best ever.
[3:12:55.600 --> 3:12:56.600]  And I haven't even asked Ted yet.
[3:12:56.600 --> 3:12:58.600]  Ted, are you even still offering that?
[3:12:58.600 --> 3:12:59.600]  I've got a few items left.
[3:12:59.600 --> 3:13:03.600]  That's why I wanted to come up on air.
[3:13:03.600 --> 3:13:06.600]  By the way, what did you think of the Mockton and Jesse Ventura interview?
[3:13:06.600 --> 3:13:08.600]  I mean, it's incredible.
[3:13:08.600 --> 3:13:11.600]  Your show is just over the top, man.
[3:13:11.600 --> 3:13:15.600]  I am just so proud to be associated with you and your crew.
[3:13:15.600 --> 3:13:18.600]  It just makes me feel like I'm really doing something right finally, you know.
[3:13:18.600 --> 3:13:19.600]  Well, I mean, let's be clear.
[3:13:19.600 --> 3:13:21.600]  I'm not on a power trip doing this.
[3:13:21.600 --> 3:13:23.600]  It's very humbling and I'm a great.
[3:13:23.600 --> 3:13:25.600]  It's great to be associated with you, Ted.
[3:13:25.600 --> 3:13:26.600]  12 years working with you.
[3:13:26.600 --> 3:13:33.600]  You've never told me what to say what to do when half or more of our radio stations turned me off after 911 when I was saying it was an inside job.
[3:13:33.600 --> 3:13:36.600]  You never said don't don't do it.
[3:13:36.600 --> 3:13:40.600]  You just pointed out, well, we've lost half our affiliates, but I want you to go out and tell the truth.
[3:13:40.600 --> 3:13:42.600]  And then we gained them back and more.
[3:13:42.600 --> 3:13:44.600]  But yeah, Ted, you're you're the best.
[3:13:44.600 --> 3:13:48.600]  And I think it's because you didn't come from radio that you have done so well in radio.
[3:13:48.600 --> 3:13:50.600]  So it's great working with you too, Ted.
[3:13:50.600 --> 3:13:51.600]  Yeah.
[3:13:51.600 --> 3:13:53.600]  Well, symbiotic, obviously.
[3:13:53.600 --> 3:13:55.600]  It's just neat to see what's going on.
[3:13:55.600 --> 3:14:04.600]  It's neat to see, you know, parliamentary parliamentary type members, you know, come on your show, Jesse Ventura, you know, Charlie Sheen.
[3:14:04.600 --> 3:14:09.600]  I mean, it's just the level that we have come to is just amazing.
[3:14:09.600 --> 3:14:12.600]  And then, of course, to see the entire world start.
[3:14:12.600 --> 3:14:20.600]  Ted, I can randomly call up rock stars and movie stars because I can hear what they're saying politically and they go, oh, yeah, you woke me up.
[3:14:20.600 --> 3:14:24.600]  I mean, I can go, I bet we woke that guy up or I bet we're influencing them column.
[3:14:24.600 --> 3:14:26.600]  And it's just like we're reaching everybody.
[3:14:26.600 --> 3:14:28.600]  It's scary, Ted.
[3:14:28.600 --> 3:14:29.600]  It is.
[3:14:29.600 --> 3:14:35.600]  It's just it sort of boggles my mind and it amazes me as to where we've come from where we've where we started.
[3:14:35.600 --> 3:14:36.600]  It just is.
[3:14:36.600 --> 3:14:38.600]  I think it's just great.
[3:14:38.600 --> 3:14:40.600]  Look at how far we've come with auditing the Fed.
[3:14:40.600 --> 3:14:42.600]  Thanks to Ron Paul and all the supporters.
[3:14:42.600 --> 3:14:44.600]  I told people we're begging him to run.
[3:14:44.600 --> 3:14:47.600]  He probably won't win, but in the resistance is victory.
[3:14:47.600 --> 3:14:51.600]  George Washington lost almost all his battles, but he won the war.
[3:14:51.600 --> 3:14:54.600]  And people then bitched and complained, excuse me, using that term.
[3:14:54.600 --> 3:14:57.600]  They griped and complained about Paul not winning and owe the money we spent.
[3:14:57.600 --> 3:15:02.600]  But now the biggest movement on universities isn't phony right wing or phony left wing.
[3:15:02.600 --> 3:15:07.600]  It's patriot, libertarian, constitutional, founding father.
[3:15:07.600 --> 3:15:15.600]  Again, we're not going to win every fight, but we're going to win the war by fighting by never surrendering.
[3:15:15.600 --> 3:15:16.600]  Ted.
[3:15:16.600 --> 3:15:18.600]  Yeah, I agree with you on that one, Alex.
[3:15:18.600 --> 3:15:19.600]  I mean, it did not.
[3:15:19.600 --> 3:15:28.600]  I didn't even see that as a back step when I when Ron Paul lost the presidential race, just because I knew what was built up to that point.
[3:15:28.600 --> 3:15:34.600]  And then you look at what's going on with the campaign for liberty and that thing's just shooting through the moon.
[3:15:34.600 --> 3:15:37.600]  We got at the Fed bill with 300 plus co-sponsors.
[3:15:37.600 --> 3:15:45.600]  I mean, who would have ever dreamed even thought that possibly this could happen five years ago, not even close.
[3:15:45.600 --> 3:15:50.600]  You know, and if the president tried to introduce something like this, Congress would have just killed it.
[3:15:50.600 --> 3:15:56.600]  So Ron Paul's in the exact right position right now in order to introduce this bill in the first place.
[3:15:56.600 --> 3:15:59.600]  I mean, we're just, you know, we're so lucky.
[3:15:59.600 --> 3:16:08.600]  It's just so incredible, like incredibly lucky that the people of the United States are waking up and they're listening and they they hear what we have to say.
[3:16:08.600 --> 3:16:12.600]  And they're going, this is the truth because that's how we're doing was we're trying to tell the truth.
[3:16:12.600 --> 3:16:16.600]  And Ted, even more than that, I mean, I've never popped champagne on the air.
[3:16:16.600 --> 3:16:22.600]  I'm not even really a drinker, but I went and bought two bottles last Sunday when these emails broke because I knew it was going to be.
[3:16:22.600 --> 3:16:34.600]  It was a day. It was like watching an enemy aircraft carrier at midway blow up on the horizon and know that your fighter bombers, your torpedo planes just went in against machine gun fire and blew the daylights out of it.
[3:16:34.600 --> 3:16:40.600]  Those hackers, those leakers were like men flying in with flat coming up at them with total precision.
[3:16:40.600 --> 3:16:42.600]  Didn't matter if bullets were coming through their windshield.
[3:16:42.600 --> 3:16:44.600]  They dropped torpedoes. Boom.
[3:16:44.600 --> 3:16:46.600]  I mean, flagship up in flames.
[3:16:46.600 --> 3:16:51.600]  And I was like champagne, baby, because I wanted the listeners to know this is special.
[3:16:51.600 --> 3:16:54.600]  And again, we're going to have victory after victory.
[3:16:54.600 --> 3:16:58.600]  We're also going to have defeat after defeat, but people are beginning to learn they have power.
[3:16:58.600 --> 3:17:05.600]  They're beginning to learn the magic of standing up and taking action and letting God fill your sales full of His will.
[3:17:05.600 --> 3:17:08.600]  Ted, I got you on about the gold pitch, but I just am so ecstatic.
[3:17:08.600 --> 3:17:10.600]  People should get into gold and silver now.
[3:17:10.600 --> 3:17:11.600]  Clearly it's only going up.
[3:17:11.600 --> 3:17:13.600]  I mean, I can't see it going down.
[3:17:13.600 --> 3:17:14.600]  I believe you should invest in it.
[3:17:14.600 --> 3:17:16.600]  I know this is an insanely good deal.
[3:17:16.600 --> 3:17:17.600]  Ted's offering you.
[3:17:17.600 --> 3:17:18.600]  It is running out.
[3:17:18.600 --> 3:17:20.600]  Can you hold it through the weekend, Ted?
[3:17:20.600 --> 3:17:22.600]  Yeah, what I have, I'll hold through the weekend.
[3:17:22.600 --> 3:17:24.600]  Tell folks what she got quick and give them the number.
[3:17:24.600 --> 3:17:30.600]  Yeah, right now what I'm offering is the British Sovereign of 325, the Frank at 236.
[3:17:30.600 --> 3:17:35.600]  I have $10 liberties at 818, $20 liberties at 1632 60.
[3:17:35.600 --> 3:17:38.600]  I mean, the Lakota's just went up to 2451.
[3:17:38.600 --> 3:17:41.600]  I couldn't stop them from increasing.
[3:17:41.600 --> 3:17:47.600]  However, I picked up those Montana Silver rounds and they're still down at $22 and 63 cents.
[3:17:47.600 --> 3:17:52.600]  And it's just been an amazing, amazing deal is on that gold.
[3:17:52.600 --> 3:17:54.600]  Ted, tell people again.
[3:17:54.600 --> 3:17:59.600]  Well, the thing that I have right now is the British sovereign of 325, the Frank at 263.
[3:17:59.600 --> 3:18:01.600]  How much would somebody be paying now at current rates?
[3:18:01.600 --> 3:18:03.600]  You're about to have to buy more.
[3:18:03.600 --> 3:18:08.600]  You're going to pay easily 10 to $20 more coin because the prices have gone up that much.
[3:18:08.600 --> 3:18:10.600]  I'm the walking liberties.
[3:18:10.600 --> 3:18:12.600]  Alex, I still have those held at 869.
[3:18:12.600 --> 3:18:18.600]  Those are going to be closer to $9 and 25 cents when I run out of this particular quantity
[3:18:18.600 --> 3:18:20.600]  that I have that's sitting in store.
[3:18:20.600 --> 3:18:21.600]  I tried to buy today.
[3:18:21.600 --> 3:18:29.600]  I had about an hour to try to buy gold at about 1148 before China came in and was doing the same thing
[3:18:29.600 --> 3:18:31.600]  that I'm doing, trying to buy into the laws.
[3:18:31.600 --> 3:18:35.600]  India is buying and shot up to 1180 again.
[3:18:35.600 --> 3:18:36.600]  They can't bring it down.
[3:18:36.600 --> 3:18:38.600]  It's just shooting up and up and up.
[3:18:38.600 --> 3:18:40.600]  Folks, here's the toll free number.
[3:18:40.600 --> 3:18:43.600]  Call it right now, 800-686-2237.
[3:18:43.600 --> 3:18:47.600]  The globalist hate it when you get out of paper and get into gold.
[3:18:47.600 --> 3:18:50.600]  All the mainline analysts are saying 10 to 30% should be in physical.
[3:18:50.600 --> 3:18:52.600]  They were never talking like that.
[3:18:52.600 --> 3:18:53.600]  Get in now.
[3:18:53.600 --> 3:18:55.600]  I believe in this deal Ted is offering.
[3:18:55.600 --> 3:18:57.600]  Tell them Alex Jones sent you or it will be the higher price.
[3:18:57.600 --> 3:19:01.600]  Ted can only sell it to you at this incredible low price because he bought it lower.
[3:19:01.600 --> 3:19:09.600]  800-686-2237-800-686-2237, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:19:09.600 --> 3:19:13.600]  The brokers are there day after Thanksgiving on this Black Friday.
[3:19:13.600 --> 3:19:18.600]  Don't go buy some Chinese junk or junk from Mexico or junk factory stuff.
[3:19:18.600 --> 3:19:21.600]  Some $100 hamster toy that should cost $5.
[3:19:21.600 --> 3:19:23.600]  Don't get ripped off.
[3:19:23.600 --> 3:19:26.600]  Get something tangible that will have value in 1,000 years.
[3:19:26.600 --> 3:19:29.600]  800-686-2237.
[3:19:29.600 --> 3:19:30.600]  It had value 6,000.
[3:19:30.600 --> 3:19:33.600]  It will have value in 5 years, 10 years, 100 years.
[3:19:33.600 --> 3:19:36.600]  800-686-2237.
[3:19:36.600 --> 3:19:40.600]  Incredible job Ted Anderson and have a great day.
[3:19:40.600 --> 3:19:41.600]  How late will the brokers be there?
[3:19:41.600 --> 3:19:42.600]  Will they be there throughout the weekend?
[3:19:42.600 --> 3:19:46.600]  Oh yeah, they'll be all throughout the weekend and you can certainly lock in by midnight tonight.
[3:19:46.600 --> 3:19:49.600]  If you just go all the way through Sunday, we'll hold it all the way through.
[3:19:49.600 --> 3:19:50.600]  But that's it and then it's going up.
[3:19:50.600 --> 3:19:52.600]  800-686-2237.
[3:19:52.600 --> 3:19:55.600]  Damon Vickers coming up from retransmission.
[3:19:55.600 --> 3:20:07.600]  Then live today, Jesse Ventura, right when retransmission starts.
[3:20:26.600 --> 3:20:31.600]  This product has the ability to rebuild cartilagin bone, which allows synovial fluid to return to the joints.
[3:20:31.600 --> 3:20:37.600]  Silica is a precursor to calcium, meaning the body turns silica into calcium and is great for the heart.
[3:20:37.600 --> 3:20:43.600]  There is no better time than now to have micro plant powder on your shelf or in your storage shelter.
[3:20:43.600 --> 3:20:46.600]  And with an unlimited shelf life, you can store it anywhere.
[3:20:46.600 --> 3:20:51.600]  Call 908-6912608 or visit hempusa.org.
[3:20:51.600 --> 3:21:00.600]  It's a great way to change your life, so call 908-6912608 or visit us at hempusa.org today.
[3:21:00.600 --> 3:21:05.600]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[3:21:05.600 --> 3:21:08.600]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[3:21:08.600 --> 3:21:13.600]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[3:21:13.600 --> 3:21:19.600]  We have tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots.
[3:21:19.600 --> 3:21:25.600]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[3:21:25.600 --> 3:21:28.600]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[3:21:28.600 --> 3:21:35.600]  The criminal offshore cartil hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[3:21:35.600 --> 3:21:39.600]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches.
[3:21:39.600 --> 3:21:41.600]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[3:21:41.600 --> 3:21:43.600]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[3:21:43.600 --> 3:21:48.600]  And right now in Washington DC, we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[3:21:59.600 --> 3:22:06.600]  Did you know that the dollar has lost 10% of its value against other currencies in the last 90 days?
[3:22:06.600 --> 3:22:11.600]  Ever think about how inflation will change your life, your savings, your retirement plans?
[3:22:11.600 --> 3:22:15.600]  Remember inflation in Zimbabwe, Argentina, the Weimar Republic?
[3:22:15.600 --> 3:22:19.600]  Let's put this another way. Who cares if your investments go up 10%?
[3:22:19.600 --> 3:22:22.600]  But you lose 40% of your purchasing power.
[3:22:22.600 --> 3:22:25.600]  Gold still buys the same amount of stuff it always did.
[3:22:25.600 --> 3:22:27.600]  Gold does not require trust in a third party.
[3:22:27.600 --> 3:22:30.600]  You can possess it in your hand. You can take it with you.
[3:22:30.600 --> 3:22:33.600]  Gold is real money. Gold is honest money.
[3:22:33.600 --> 3:22:36.600]  My name is Daniel Arson from Midas Resources.

[3:23:56.600 --> 3:24:22.600]  You will never use anything else again.
[3:24:22.600 --> 3:24:31.600]  This is a short segment, but in the long segment, we're going to be taking some phone calls,
[3:24:31.600 --> 3:24:40.600]  your questions or comments for Damon Vickers, the toll free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[3:24:40.600 --> 3:24:45.600]  Specifically questions for our guest on any investment issue, you can get his take on it.
[3:24:45.600 --> 3:24:49.600]  Let's finish up with the New World Order, where you see the markets going, where you see gold going,
[3:24:49.600 --> 3:24:53.600]  how you see this crisis shaking out. I mean, I know you don't have a complete crystal ball.
[3:24:53.600 --> 3:24:57.600]  Nobody does, but you're best dead reckoning on where we're going.
[3:24:57.600 --> 3:25:00.600]  But when you talk about New World Order, talk about global government.
[3:25:00.600 --> 3:25:04.600]  Studying that, how do you see it forming? What do you see it making up?
[3:25:04.600 --> 3:25:07.600]  What do you see its policies being?
[3:25:07.600 --> 3:25:21.600]  Well, that's a big one to cover. There's a trend, which is what we do. I'm a trend follower.
[3:25:21.600 --> 3:25:25.600]  The trend for the markets last year, we're down. We want to make money from that.
[3:25:25.600 --> 3:25:29.600]  We really don't care which direction the market goes. The market wants to go higher, great.
[3:25:29.600 --> 3:25:32.600]  We want to be there. The market wants to go lower, great. We want to be there.
[3:25:32.600 --> 3:25:37.600]  Gold, I got really excited about gold when it broke through $1,000 an ounce.
[3:25:37.600 --> 3:25:41.600]  We had gotten a long oil at the same time. Both assets are going up.
[3:25:41.600 --> 3:25:45.600]  We're making money in both of them, and we're doing really well with it today,
[3:25:45.600 --> 3:25:50.600]  because as we speak, gold is hitting a new high, and oil is up at $3 a barrel.
[3:25:50.600 --> 3:25:55.600]  When I saw that happening, and this is the same thing that was happening last year,
[3:25:55.600 --> 3:26:01.600]  when I saw the break last year in the financials, there was a week last year
[3:26:01.600 --> 3:26:07.600]  where the banking index broke support. I sent out a release to all the media,
[3:26:07.600 --> 3:26:11.600]  and the title of that release was called On the Eve of Destruction.
[3:26:11.600 --> 3:26:15.600]  The week that followed that, we had the worst week in market history.
[3:26:15.600 --> 3:26:21.600]  We went down like 20-some-odd percent for the week. It was horrific for most, great for us,
[3:26:21.600 --> 3:26:25.600]  and we made money that week. When I saw gold break through $1,000,
[3:26:25.600 --> 3:26:30.600]  that kind of felt like a tell to me that this would also involve the currency.
[3:26:30.600 --> 3:26:33.600]  Which is the dollar, which we've also seen.
[3:26:33.600 --> 3:26:39.600]  So gold breaking through $1,000 really says that the dollar is likely to come
[3:26:39.600 --> 3:26:44.600]  under increasing, increasing pressure. The dollar coming, increasing pressure,
[3:26:44.600 --> 3:26:50.600]  means an accelerated loss of value and an accelerated rise in the price of gold.
[3:26:50.600 --> 3:26:54.600]  So we are basically short the dollar, I guess, by being long gold.
[3:26:54.600 --> 3:26:57.600]  We're basically short the dollar by being long oil.
[3:26:57.600 --> 3:27:01.600]  What investors can do is they can buy some gold that's in a bull market.
[3:27:01.600 --> 3:27:05.600]  And in any bull market, you want to buy it on weakness.
[3:27:05.600 --> 3:27:08.600]  If you're time horizon is long enough, it probably doesn't matter where you buy it,
[3:27:08.600 --> 3:27:11.600]  but it's one of the things that you can do to kind of protect yourself
[3:27:11.600 --> 3:27:18.600]  because the loss of purchasing power for Americans may be really profound.
[3:27:18.600 --> 3:27:22.600]  What do we know about the dollar? We know that the dollar already, Alex,
[3:27:22.600 --> 3:27:30.600]  as I'm sure you know, the dollar has lost about 97% of its value since 1971.
[3:27:30.600 --> 3:27:36.600]  Since Nixon cut the, you know, cut the cord to the dollar, lost 97%.
[3:27:36.600 --> 3:27:41.600]  And so, you know, the government has done all these things to try to shore up the economy, right?
[3:27:41.600 --> 3:27:44.600]  You know, we had the equity bubble in 2000 and then the burst.
[3:27:44.600 --> 3:27:47.600]  And then they go together, well, what can we do to keep this all going?
[3:27:47.600 --> 3:27:51.600]  What do they do? They printed money. They deregulated the financial system.
[3:27:51.600 --> 3:27:55.600]  We had a separation between banks and brokerage firms, right?
[3:27:55.600 --> 3:27:58.600]  Because we've learned lessons from the crash of 1929.
[3:27:58.600 --> 3:28:03.600]  But we dissolved that and banks and brokerage firms got together.
[3:28:03.600 --> 3:28:08.600]  Banks could then make risky bets with your deposits, which is exactly what they did.
[3:28:08.600 --> 3:28:12.600]  And this was all to juice up the economy in 2002, 2003.
[3:28:12.600 --> 3:28:17.600]  So we juiced up the economy and we created the second bubble, which was the real estate bubble.
[3:28:17.600 --> 3:28:24.600]  And you can blame the Wall Street, you can blame the investment bankers, the mortgage industry, Anthony Mazzillo.
[3:28:24.600 --> 3:28:26.600]  We were short countrywide last year.
[3:28:26.600 --> 3:28:29.600]  But you could also blame the participants, the general public.
[3:28:29.600 --> 3:28:35.600]  They got a little too euphoric. They got a little too excited about real estate and flipping houses and, you know, all that kind of stuff.
[3:28:35.600 --> 3:28:36.600]  They took the bait.
[3:28:36.600 --> 3:28:40.600]  They took the bait. They sure did. They swallowed it and it was very toxic.
[3:28:40.600 --> 3:28:46.600]  And now here we go again. Last year we have a meltdown where, like, you can no longer, there are no more suckers left.
[3:28:46.600 --> 3:28:50.600]  To buy those crazily priced, insanely priced houses.
[3:28:50.600 --> 3:28:52.600]  There's just nobody left.
[3:28:52.600 --> 3:28:57.600]  They've tapped into every fool on the street to give them a no money down type mortgage.
[3:28:57.600 --> 3:28:59.600]  And then we run into a crisis.
[3:28:59.600 --> 3:29:02.600]  Basically, there's no more sources of funding left.
[3:29:02.600 --> 3:29:05.600]  Last year was a crisis of funding.
[3:29:05.600 --> 3:29:11.600]  You could no longer find anybody to finance the economy, because that's what we were doing.
[3:29:11.600 --> 3:29:15.600]  We were selling these swaps on a global basis.
[3:29:15.600 --> 3:29:19.600]  We almost bankrupted Iceland. We virtually did bankrupt the country.
[3:29:19.600 --> 3:29:23.600]  And, you know, we look at Madoff and say he was a horrific guy.
[3:29:23.600 --> 3:29:26.600]  And the guy was no saint. He did some very evil things.
[3:29:26.600 --> 3:29:40.600]  But here, the United States, and here we as Americans, we have floated out this toxic garbage to the entire planet to finance our illusion of a lifestyle.
[3:29:40.600 --> 3:29:43.600]  Let's talk about that. Let's talk about that on the other side.
[3:29:43.600 --> 3:29:45.600]  Quick break. We'll come back. Finish up there.
[3:29:45.600 --> 3:29:50.600]  Get into your forecast for the future and take phone calls with our guests, Damon.

[3:33:28.600 --> 3:33:33.600]  Here on the radio show, very, very excited to have him here with us.
[3:33:33.600 --> 3:33:36.600]  I want to tell you about a few sponsors before we go back to him.
[3:33:36.600 --> 3:33:39.600]  One of them is Akola Blue, the atmospheric water generator.
[3:33:39.600 --> 3:33:43.600]  It looks like a water cooler, a high-tech water cooler with no water bottle on the top.
[3:33:43.600 --> 3:33:49.600]  It grabs water out of the air. It's like evil carbon dioxide that Al Gore wants to tax.
[3:33:49.600 --> 3:33:57.600]  Well, water must be evil too because it's in our atmosphere and it grabs it out of the air, puts it through seven filters,
[3:33:57.600 --> 3:34:02.600]  reverse osmosis, you name it, and stores it and illuminated stainless steel tank in the bottom.
[3:34:02.600 --> 3:34:06.600]  Seven and a half gallons a day. That's their small unit. They have bigger units.
[3:34:06.600 --> 3:34:12.600]  They've got them on hand right now. The Akola Blue 28 is their most economical model.
[3:34:12.600 --> 3:34:24.600]  Akola Blue, E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E dot com or 800-6916-043-800-6916-043.
[3:34:24.600 --> 3:34:27.600]  The best, cleanest drinking water you can get anywhere.
[3:34:27.600 --> 3:34:30.600]  And lastly, a plug for the online video bookstore.
[3:34:30.600 --> 3:34:39.600]  It is the holiday season right now. Don't want to be politically incorrect and say Christmas, but it is Christmas.
[3:34:39.600 --> 3:34:44.600]  I'm sorry. I apologize. I celebrate Christmas for everybody. I may be arrested in this new world order.
[3:34:44.600 --> 3:34:50.600]  But fall of the Republic, give the gift of truth this holiday season.
[3:34:50.600 --> 3:34:54.600]  Here is the new cover. We had one with Obama on the front, but I like this one better.
[3:34:54.600 --> 3:34:58.600]  It's got the Statue of Liberty plunging downward with Obama down here on the bottom.
[3:34:58.600 --> 3:35:04.600]  Fall of the Republic, two-hour, 24-minute film with a bunch of extras, who the bankers are, what their new world order is,
[3:35:04.600 --> 3:35:09.600]  what they're setting up, the police state control grid, the mind control of the television.
[3:35:09.600 --> 3:35:13.600]  This is really my best work. Fall of the Republic, give the gift of truth.
[3:35:13.600 --> 3:35:17.600]  This is a film that shatters the left-right paradigm. This is my best work.
[3:35:17.600 --> 3:35:23.600]  You can get it free. You can get Fall of the Republic and then get an interview with Aaron Russo,
[3:35:23.600 --> 3:35:28.600]  who has reflections and warnings on DVD, this documentary film, 90 minutes long,
[3:35:28.600 --> 3:35:33.600]  absolutely free in one of the combo deals. There's a bunch of other specials at infowars.com

[3:35:51.600 --> 3:35:57.600]  We have a deal through the new year, a Christmas special, five months free right now at prisonplanet.tv,
[3:35:57.600 --> 3:36:01.600]  where all my films are posted and we somalcast the radio show In Living Color.
[3:36:01.600 --> 3:36:05.600]  I want to thank all the members of prisonplanet.tv.
[3:36:05.600 --> 3:36:10.600]  Okay, going back to Damon Vickers. Damon, we were getting in to the new world order.
[3:36:10.600 --> 3:36:14.600]  What's being set up? What you see happening in the future?
[3:36:14.600 --> 3:36:18.600]  Tell me, how high do you think gold may go? What's the time frame there?
[3:36:18.600 --> 3:36:22.600]  And then you were posing the question to me during the break, well, we're going to have a new world order.
[3:36:22.600 --> 3:36:25.600]  I mean, you're saying the dollar is pretty much going to collapse a new system,
[3:36:25.600 --> 3:36:29.600]  but who's going to run that new world order? So, David Vickers, break it down.
[3:36:29.600 --> 3:36:35.600]  Yeah, one of the things that you say, Alex, that I love amongst some other things you talk about,
[3:36:35.600 --> 3:36:40.600]  there are those that are kind of conservative clones, and you know, there are a couple of them on the radio.
[3:36:40.600 --> 3:36:44.600]  And there are a number of people that are the other way,
[3:36:44.600 --> 3:36:50.600]  and that neither the Democrats nor the Republicans are worth anything.
[3:36:50.600 --> 3:36:55.600]  That it's a total fantasy, one way or the other, that we participate in every 40 years.
[3:36:55.600 --> 3:37:01.600]  And so, it's not working. The other thing is that, you know, that there is not,
[3:37:01.600 --> 3:37:07.600]  historically, all paper currencies have historically lost all their value.
[3:37:07.600 --> 3:37:15.600]  And that as the problem is that as the population and the government's unfold, basically what they do
[3:37:15.600 --> 3:37:22.600]  is we keep on, we vote in people that just give out all this largesse to the general population.
[3:37:22.600 --> 3:37:30.600]  You know, the population wants to continue to pile on all these bennies and benefits and special projects.
[3:37:30.600 --> 3:37:34.600]  And it's not just the United States, it's all over the planet.
[3:37:34.600 --> 3:37:42.600]  And the way that we do that is it's very easy since the currency, right, is not based on anything to just print money.
[3:37:42.600 --> 3:37:48.600]  So the currencies get debased, they get, and inevitably they get, the currencies basically get wiped out.
[3:37:48.600 --> 3:37:56.600]  There's a kind of a long-term historical cycle that we seem to go in, which is you get this debasement of the currency
[3:37:56.600 --> 3:38:02.600]  and a kind of a laissez-faire environment, which I think the speculation of the last 10 years with the Internet
[3:38:02.600 --> 3:38:07.600]  and the crazy, you know, real estate bubbles and, you know, putting Donald Trump back on TV,
[3:38:07.600 --> 3:38:11.600]  which was, if there was ever a sign of the New World Order and the sign of the apocalypse,
[3:38:11.600 --> 3:38:13.600]  maybe it was Donald coming back to life.
[3:38:13.600 --> 3:38:21.600]  And then you get the arrival, you get a disintegration of the government, a disintegration of order, right,
[3:38:21.600 --> 3:38:26.600]  of kind of chaos, and then desperation of the general population.
[3:38:26.600 --> 3:38:40.600]  And then the arrival of a focused focal point or a kind of a more of a fascist national kind of a dictatorship, really.
[3:38:40.600 --> 3:38:44.600]  You know, you saw it with the arrival of Adolf Hitler, Mussolini, this type of thing.
[3:38:44.600 --> 3:38:50.600]  I know it's hard to imagine that we could see anything like that in the United States, but it's a possibility.
[3:38:50.600 --> 3:38:57.600]  And so what we need to do is decide whether or not if this is going to be a controlled landing, right,
[3:38:57.600 --> 3:39:00.600]  or it's going to be a total utter crash.
[3:39:00.600 --> 3:39:07.600]  Well, let me throw this in because David, I mean, Damon Vickers, the whole issue here is,
[3:39:07.600 --> 3:39:12.600]  speaking of David, David Rockefeller and others have stated what their plan is.
[3:39:12.600 --> 3:39:14.600]  They have implemented this implosion.
[3:39:14.600 --> 3:39:20.600]  Maury Strong talks about implementing this implosion on its ashes to build the new international architecture.
[3:39:20.600 --> 3:39:26.600]  They're telling the public none of this change exists while the U.N. Secretary General writes editorials
[3:39:26.600 --> 3:39:31.600]  calling for global government and global carbon taxes so that we're not part of the debate.
[3:39:31.600 --> 3:39:38.600]  They're just denying it's even happening while in serious intellectual debate, it's all being erected and set up right now.
[3:39:38.600 --> 3:39:44.600]  And so my problem is one of their higher level sales pitches they use is to say,
[3:39:44.600 --> 3:39:48.600]  oh, the question is what type of world government, what type of new world order do you want?
[3:39:48.600 --> 3:39:51.600]  Well, how about we have a new world order where we don't have a world government?
[3:39:51.600 --> 3:39:56.600]  How about we have a new world order where the central bankers engineering these Ponzi schemes go to jail?
[3:39:56.600 --> 3:40:02.600]  How about we have a new world order where we have a global declaration of independence and national sovereignty
[3:40:02.600 --> 3:40:09.600]  instead of being maneuvered into, well, okay, then do you want to have a say in what type of new world order are we going to have?
[3:40:09.600 --> 3:40:13.600]  The elite setting up this system won't even allow a real debate.
[3:40:13.600 --> 3:40:21.600]  They ridicule anyone that, you know, Limbaugh, Hannity, they still won't even admit this is happening after decades of saying it doesn't exist.
[3:40:21.600 --> 3:40:24.600]  I mean, you understand where I'm going with this.
[3:40:24.600 --> 3:40:28.600]  We don't have a say in how this government changes.
[3:40:28.600 --> 3:40:33.600]  And I understand it's sold as an evolution and a new world order, but the new world order has been engineered.
[3:40:33.600 --> 3:40:34.600]  Go ahead.
[3:40:34.600 --> 3:40:41.600]  Okay, that we can debate things, add in front of them, and yet nothing will get accomplished and nothing will get done.
[3:40:41.600 --> 3:40:44.600]  We're all afraid of change.
[3:40:44.600 --> 3:40:48.600]  We're all afraid of things arriving that we don't know anything about.
[3:40:48.600 --> 3:40:54.600]  But I think we'd have to all agree and admit to ourselves that the present order of things,
[3:40:54.600 --> 3:41:00.600]  the order of wiping out fish stocks, the order of wiping out, you know, the resources,
[3:41:00.600 --> 3:41:11.600]  and everybody believes that they have the sovereign right to rape and pillage their forests and their, you know, the world's nature.
[3:41:11.600 --> 3:41:14.600]  I know, but the globalists always say...
[3:41:14.600 --> 3:41:16.600]  The environment is all going to die.
[3:41:16.600 --> 3:41:22.600]  I know, but the globalists always say they're doing this to stop it when they are the progenitors of most of it.
[3:41:22.600 --> 3:41:33.600]  Well, I think there's a desire for those, there is a desire for certain people to try to bring order to a world
[3:41:33.600 --> 3:41:40.600]  that is entirely disorderly and headed towards what could be unfathomably about suffering.
[3:41:40.600 --> 3:41:45.600]  We've got a billion people on the planet right now, Alex, that are starving right now.
[3:41:45.600 --> 3:41:46.600]  A billion of them.
[3:41:46.600 --> 3:41:48.600]  That's a very large percentage of the population.
[3:41:48.600 --> 3:41:55.600]  We can look in the United States how many people are, what do they say, one out of five kids' families are in food stamps right now.
[3:41:55.600 --> 3:41:58.600]  Clearly, the order that we have right now is not working.
[3:41:58.600 --> 3:42:00.600]  We need something new.
[3:42:00.600 --> 3:42:06.600]  I understand that there are a lot of problems and crises, but when I read the Royal Commission on Population
[3:42:06.600 --> 3:42:10.600]  secretly put out by the British government, now declassified, 50 years ago,
[3:42:10.600 --> 3:42:14.600]  they said we're going to create globalization to control the third world.
[3:42:14.600 --> 3:42:19.600]  We're going to keep them from industrializing, even though that would clean up the environment and lower their numbers,
[3:42:19.600 --> 3:42:24.600]  because we're going to let the people bomb be used as a weapon against them, just like the UN claims.
[3:42:24.600 --> 3:42:31.600]  We never should have gone into the third world in the first place, and every time that we go in there, we create more havoc.
[3:42:31.600 --> 3:42:39.600]  Even the compassionate things that we do in terms of providing aid and care to them, only further exacerbates the problem and it just gets worse and worse.
[3:42:39.600 --> 3:42:47.600]  Let me just say this, I totally understand where you're coming from when you say the existing order is a bunch of criminal pirates,
[3:42:47.600 --> 3:42:49.600]  raping and pillaging and looting.
[3:42:49.600 --> 3:42:50.600]  The problem is-
[3:42:50.600 --> 3:42:54.600]  This is where we agree, this is where we agree, Alex.
[3:42:54.600 --> 3:42:56.600]  But it's a two-face.
[3:42:56.600 --> 3:42:59.600]  You've got two faces, one here and one on the back.
[3:42:59.600 --> 3:43:01.600]  The globalists are the pirates.
[3:43:01.600 --> 3:43:08.600]  They then rotate their face around as the saviors and everything they're proposing just gives them more power
[3:43:08.600 --> 3:43:15.600]  and has this frosting, this sugar coating of helping the poor and helping the environment.
[3:43:15.600 --> 3:43:17.600]  They wanted to help the environment.
[3:43:17.600 --> 3:43:19.600]  They'd be restricting genetic engineering.
[3:43:19.600 --> 3:43:25.600]  Well, you talked about David Rockefeller, and I know it's convenient to demonize the Rockefellers.
[3:43:25.600 --> 3:43:33.600]  We wouldn't have much of the national park system in the United States if it weren't for Lawrence Rockefeller.
[3:43:33.600 --> 3:43:40.600]  There'd be no Teton National Park, there'd be no U.S. Virgin Islands National Park, there'd be no Acadia National Park.
[3:43:40.600 --> 3:43:42.600]  The list goes on and on.
[3:43:42.600 --> 3:43:52.600]  These are people that long ago made a tremendous amount of wealth and then they began to turn their wealth to greater causes
[3:43:52.600 --> 3:43:54.600]  and trying to serve humanity.
[3:43:54.600 --> 3:44:00.600]  I think all of us would agree that none of us like seeing suffering.
[3:44:00.600 --> 3:44:08.600]  And to the extent that we can move the planet towards alleviating human suffering and more balance,
[3:44:08.600 --> 3:44:11.600]  I think we're heading in the right direction.
[3:44:11.600 --> 3:44:16.600]  Hey Damon, I appreciate you coming on and I want to have you back up again because this is intriguing.
[3:44:16.600 --> 3:44:21.600]  But this is the slick New World Order sales job because I recognize what you're doing.
[3:44:21.600 --> 3:44:24.600]  I've heard this from other high-powered people.
[3:44:24.600 --> 3:44:27.600]  Hold on, but I've been given this speech before.
[3:44:27.600 --> 3:44:30.600]  Hold on, I've been given this speech before.
[3:44:30.600 --> 3:44:39.600]  What I'm telling you is the fruits of the people captaining our planet right now are, look, the Rockefeller set up eugenics.
[3:44:39.600 --> 3:44:43.600]  The Rockefeller set up CPSing people's children and the family courts.
[3:44:43.600 --> 3:44:46.600]  They set up the Human Genome Project in Cold Springs Harbor.
[3:44:46.600 --> 3:44:52.600]  I understand they also set up some of the national parks because they wanted places where there were no people.
[3:44:52.600 --> 3:44:57.600]  That's good.
[3:44:57.600 --> 3:44:59.600]  Well, you know, what do we do?
[3:44:59.600 --> 3:45:06.600]  Our nation, the United States, enjoys a very high standard of living.
[3:45:06.600 --> 3:45:09.600]  Many of us sit around on lazy boy chairs.
[3:45:09.600 --> 3:45:17.600]  We fill our faces with macaroni and cheese and in the evening we watch the newlywed game and ridiculous program.
[3:45:17.600 --> 3:45:19.600]  We medicate ourselves, right?
[3:45:19.600 --> 3:45:24.600]  And we do this with debt that we foist onto our own Ponzi scheme.
[3:45:24.600 --> 3:45:30.600]  Yes, we're an obese, decadent society that won't even engage in birth control so we just abort our babies.
[3:45:30.600 --> 3:45:35.600]  We're a throwaway society and so now we're being thrown away by the global system.
[3:45:35.600 --> 3:45:41.600]  How fair is that that we in the United States live that way?
[3:45:41.600 --> 3:45:58.600]  And then you've got people in India, in Bangladesh, in Vietnam that are making $0.67 an hour with members of their family starving to death while we live this way.
[3:45:58.600 --> 3:46:00.600]  Is that compassionate?
[3:46:00.600 --> 3:46:06.600]  Well, I'll tell you this, a lot of them are doing better now than they were just 20 years ago.
[3:46:06.600 --> 3:46:14.600]  I'll tell you that because of the limited, but that's the globalist sales pitch is guilt to what's left of the middle class here when really...
[3:46:14.600 --> 3:46:16.600]  Forget about the guilt.
[3:46:16.600 --> 3:46:21.600]  But then our money, what's left of us gets transferred to the bankers. It doesn't get to some African.
[3:46:21.600 --> 3:46:35.600]  No desire to do that. We've got a rising unemployment rate and the reason why we have a rising unemployment rate is we simply cannot match the unit cost, the labor cost, the unit cost of production that can be achieved in Vietnam
[3:46:35.600 --> 3:46:44.600]  But how does lowering our standard of living, when it's all fiat to begin with, how does that help Africa and Asia and Latin America?
[3:46:44.600 --> 3:46:48.600]  That's actually going to hurt them because they're not even going to have their customer anymore.
[3:46:48.600 --> 3:46:58.600]  This is how globalization and the giant sucking sound, the race to the bottom, destroys all sides in the end except for the finance oligarchs.
[3:46:58.600 --> 3:47:05.600]  Well, if we don't try to create some type of a balance globally, Alex, we will be racing to the bottom.
[3:47:05.600 --> 3:47:09.600]  Let me ask you this then because you are an honest guy. We'll talk about the truth on national television.
[3:47:09.600 --> 3:47:15.600]  What do we do then if Damon Vickers was staring things? What would you do?
[3:47:15.600 --> 3:47:30.600]  Well, I think we have to create a global environment whereby we have balance and that's essentially the problem I think on a planetary basis. We're living out of balance.
[3:47:30.600 --> 3:47:41.600]  Our own country is out of balance. We cannot go and take a million tons of herring out of the ocean and know that it doesn't affect the whales.
[3:47:41.600 --> 3:47:46.600]  The oceans are really running out of fish right now, but the issue here is, again, I want to go back to this.
[3:47:46.600 --> 3:47:58.600]  The issue is realizing that heaven is a place that is something that the closest, our fondest imaginings of what heaven is, is here on our planet.
[3:47:58.600 --> 3:48:07.600]  We need to take care of the planet that we live in and not be raping it and think it's ours to exploit. We have to sustain our home and we're not treating it respectfully.
[3:48:07.600 --> 3:48:14.600]  Well, I'll tell you this, putting a tax on carbon isn't going to do that.
[3:48:14.600 --> 3:48:25.600]  But Damon, putting a tax on carbon to oxide is a giant distraction from real environmental policies that we could agree to carry out and make profitable.
[3:48:25.600 --> 3:48:40.600]  The government that we have in place right now is a total disaster. This whole move towards healthcare is just insane. Our government has become a giant tumor, a marine tumor that is sucking life out of this country.
[3:48:40.600 --> 3:48:43.600]  These are not easy. These are not easy.
[3:48:43.600 --> 3:48:59.600]  But Damon, that's my point, is the same globalist that brought us into imbalance certainly nudged us in that way using our own weaknesses to get us dependent on them. They got us dependent in this largest, decadent, laissez faire welfare system so that we could be controlled.
[3:48:59.600 --> 3:49:12.600]  I have their own documents. They brag that they engineered this, and then now they're offering the solution that sounds somewhat similar to what you're saying. I'm saying the problem is it's a setup.
[3:49:12.600 --> 3:49:31.600]  Well, I'd say that the participants also set themselves up. You're talking about you've got an addict and you've got a drug dealer, and there's no doubt that there's a dealer establishment, but the addict is also partly to blame for their own behavior.
[3:49:31.600 --> 3:49:43.600]  I agree to a certain extent, but that's like saying a 10-year-old who gets kidnapped, it's partly their fault, and it is true. They went in the front yard. They went down the street. They talked to strangers. They wanted to see the puppy dog.
[3:49:43.600 --> 3:49:58.600]  That's a terrible analogy. We've got real challenges ahead of us. The dollar is disintegrating. We know that. That's what's currently happening right now. The dollar is losing value. Pretty much every day that the market is open is a day to sell more dollars.
[3:49:58.600 --> 3:50:13.600]  Gold is rising. Oil is rising. It's not just the dollar that's weak. It's also the currencies in the United Kingdom, and it's also the other westernized nations, because none of these countries are really viable going concerns.
[3:50:13.600 --> 3:50:18.600]  We don't export anything, and we can't produce things.
[3:50:18.600 --> 3:50:28.600]  Globalism did this to us. Tax incentives to move overseas. I know, but we were set up. We were pushed into this. Big government did this.
[3:50:28.600 --> 3:50:34.600]  Well, I think it's kind of a cycle of how societies run.
[3:50:34.600 --> 3:50:37.600]  I agree with you. How high is gold going to go?
[3:50:37.600 --> 3:50:45.600]  Good question. It could absolutely go through the roof. I mean, it could go to $3,000, $4,000 an ounce, start to say. The trend is up.
[3:50:45.600 --> 3:50:49.600]  And what is it trending towards over 2,000 the next 12 months?
[3:50:49.600 --> 3:50:51.600]  I'm hard to say.
[3:50:51.600 --> 3:51:00.600]  This is an incredible interview. Damon Vickers. I'm going to try to twist his arm maybe 10, 15 to the next hour so we can take these calls. This guy, he's giving me a run for my money.
[3:51:00.600 --> 3:51:07.600]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind? If it's Berkey water purification systems, this message is for you.

[3:51:16.600 --> 3:51:26.600]  Remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride and contaminants from municipal water. These filters are powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water, making them perfect for rainwater collection systems.

[3:52:08.600 --> 3:52:13.600]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[3:52:13.600 --> 3:52:19.600]  We have tremendous influence on our president and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[3:52:19.600 --> 3:52:24.600]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[3:52:24.600 --> 3:52:34.600]  Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation. The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[3:52:34.600 --> 3:52:41.600]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke and Arsonists, they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[3:52:41.600 --> 3:52:48.600]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[3:54:12.600 --> 3:54:17.600]  I'm not going to let him catch me. I'm not going to let him catch the Midnight Rider.
[3:54:17.600 --> 3:54:24.600]  I tell you, this is an impressive interview, and I look forward to future debates with him.
[3:54:24.600 --> 3:54:32.600]  We really appreciate Damon Vickers, DamonVickers.com coming on with us. He is the Chief Investment Officer with Nine Points Management and Research.
[3:54:32.600 --> 3:54:42.600]  He's one of the nicer formerly East Coast Blue Bloods here, hooked up with the Rockefellers and others.
[3:54:42.600 --> 3:54:50.600]  He is talking about the world government coming in, and he is talking about the end of the dollar.
[3:54:50.600 --> 3:54:59.600]  When we start the next hour, take your calls for all of you that are holding Shanky, Andrew, Karen, Anita, and others.
[3:54:59.600 --> 3:55:05.600]  Just briefly, we were talking in the break. You're saying, look, I grew up in a Buddhist monastery or lived in one.
[3:55:05.600 --> 3:55:12.600]  I'm not Beelzebub. That was a joke. I apologize. I just meant you speak with a silver tongue, and I understand it's a very convincing argument.
[3:55:12.600 --> 3:55:16.600]  Are you saying world government is a foregone...
[3:55:16.600 --> 3:55:29.600]  My dad left Goldman Sachs, gave up the Brooks Brothers, gave up all that stuff, and I would sit and meditate with my father at 5.30 in the morning.
[3:55:29.600 --> 3:55:36.600]  I lived in a monastery called Odeonum, one of only three kids that ever lived there. It's on 1100 acres, and it's a Tibetan Buddhist monastery, but for real.
[3:55:36.600 --> 3:55:47.600]  What we're all about is trying to alleviate human suffering. So all of us would agree that suffering is something that we want to avoid, and that we don't like seeing others...
[3:55:47.600 --> 3:55:50.600]  Yeah, but you're saying the system's bad we've got now.
[3:55:50.600 --> 3:56:02.600]  We like seeing our planet suffer, and that we are living out of balance, and that we need to get not only the United States back into balance, but the world back into balance.
[3:56:02.600 --> 3:56:09.600]  Prince Philip says we need to call 80%. You're not for calling people, are you?
[3:56:09.600 --> 3:56:23.600]  No, I'm not for calling people, but on the other hand, if you're a West Indian down in the Caribbean, you think it's your right to have 28 kids, and they do. I've met them, and it's not sustainable.
[3:56:23.600 --> 3:56:29.600]  Many of those islands in the Caribbean, they were paradise, and now they're not paradise at all.
[3:56:29.600 --> 3:56:36.600]  Let me ask you this, then. Let me ask you this. Here's the deal.
[3:56:36.600 --> 3:56:50.600]  Here's what I have to say to you, though. That's why I made in-game blueprint for global enslavement my film about eugenics, because I agree with you that we should have a debate about this, and people should know all these people eating McDonald's hamburgers,
[3:56:50.600 --> 3:57:02.600]  eating McDonald's hamburgers, watching porn, and having abortions. They don't realize that the elite have decided to kill their butts. So, I mean, I'm just glad that you're just being honest about all this.
[3:57:02.600 --> 3:57:12.600]  I'm not saying you're calling for killing people. You're kind of the soft touch in all this, but I'm telling you, this is real, and the public better grow up and get off their fat butts.
[3:57:12.600 --> 3:57:23.600]  Our planet cannot support every one of us going out there and having 24 and 28 kids. It's not sustainable.
[3:57:23.600 --> 3:57:40.600]  Here's another problem. Only educated people are dying out. The West has 1.3 replacement for every two adults, and so the West is saying they want to target the West for no one to have kids, so the West has to die, and then everybody else can have 500 kids?
[3:57:40.600 --> 3:57:55.600]  No, nobody needs to be targeted, but we need to recognize and come into a common understanding and belief about what our relationship is to one another, and what our relationship is to the planet that we live on and try to live responsibly.
[3:57:55.600 --> 3:58:03.600]  And having 16 and 28 kids is not responsible. I think all of us could agree to that. We can agree on that, Alex.
[3:58:03.600 --> 3:58:09.600]  But the minute you don't let somebody have 10 kids, then you can't have two.
[3:58:09.600 --> 3:58:20.600]  Okay, and there are nations that believe it's their right to deforest their rainforest, but these are the lungs of the planet. Should they be allowed to do that? Because they're sovereign rights?
[3:58:20.600 --> 3:58:32.600]  Well, the nations, that's the oil companies. And Al Gore owns Occidental Petroleum. He didn't call them for stopping that. He wants to tax what plants breathe. That's what I mean, is that we're just evil.
[3:58:32.600 --> 3:58:42.600]  And no matter what we do, it's going to hell in the handbasket, and all these globalists have these great reasons we should sell out to them, but that brings more destruction.
