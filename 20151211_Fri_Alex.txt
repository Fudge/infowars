[00:00:06.365 --> 00:00:11.209]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:12.791]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.791 --> 00:00:14.332]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.332 --> 00:00:18.536]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.536 --> 00:00:23.400]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.383]  Kelly Barusi is the head of policy at the Department of Homeland Security.
[00:00:27.383 --> 00:00:28.604]  She testified yesterday.
[00:00:29.905 --> 00:00:30.706]  There's a bunch of it.
[00:00:30.706 --> 00:00:39.632]  There's over an hour of this, but she couldn't answer any of the questions and they basically admit that they're just letting people in, not doing basic screening.
[00:00:39.632 --> 00:00:53.162]  But don't worry, the NSA is surveilling everything we're doing and major whistleblowers have gone public that they were ordered not to go after the very mosque and the very people who reportedly attacked in San Bernardino last week.
[00:00:53.162 --> 00:00:54.543]  So let's play a few minutes of this.
[00:00:54.543 --> 00:00:57.886]  We'll go to break and come back with more on this live Friday edition.
[00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:07.563]  Earlier this week, the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee gave an important speech where he talked about extremist groups, terrorist groups are trying to exploit the refugee program.
[00:01:07.563 --> 00:01:16.428]  So, like Mr. Russell just a few minutes ago, I would like to see if you can give us some numbers, just so this committee and the American people have this information.
[00:01:16.428 --> 00:01:18.989]  How many Syrian refugees have entered the United States in the last year?
[00:01:20.894 --> 00:01:31.062]  Sir, I didn't bring any of my, uh, any of the refugee numbers with me because I was prepared to talk about visa waiver, but I can certainly have, um, us send that to you.
[00:01:31.062 --> 00:01:35.125]  Do you know how many Americans have traveled to Syria in the last year?
[00:01:35.125 --> 00:01:38.528]  I don't have that number on me either.
[00:01:38.528 --> 00:01:43.172]  So you wouldn't know how many Americans have traveled and then returned?
[00:01:43.172 --> 00:01:44.413]  I don't have that number on me.
[00:01:45.957 --> 00:01:53.460]  Um, how many visa waiver program overstays are there currently in the United States?
[00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.661]  Sir, I didn't bring that number with me.
[00:01:56.661 --> 00:01:57.182]  Ms.
[00:01:57.182 --> 00:02:00.163]  Bricey, when I look at the witness list, you got the longest title.
[00:02:01.414 --> 00:02:06.036]  Deputy Assistant Secretary, Screening Coordination, Office of Policy, Department of Homeland Security.
[00:02:06.036 --> 00:02:09.057]  You got the longest title, and it says Screening Coordination.
[00:02:09.057 --> 00:02:13.098]  Now what is that, what are you, what are you, what screening are you coordinating?
[00:02:13.098 --> 00:02:17.580]  Is that just intra-agency or is that inter-agency?
[00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.260]  It's both.
[00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.561]  It's both, so it's all that.
[00:02:19.561 --> 00:02:22.762]  I coordinate across DHS components.
[00:02:22.762 --> 00:02:28.464]  And the two biggest issues right now that we're dealing with, we had these terrible tragedies, terrible terrorist attacks.
[00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:36.284]  And we're talking about the refugee issue and the Visa Waiver Program issue and you can't give us any numbers on either program?
[00:02:36.284 --> 00:02:39.126]  So I came prepared to talk about the Visa Waiver Program.
[00:02:39.126 --> 00:02:45.089]  And I just asked you how many Visa Waiver Program overstays are there and you said you don't know.
[00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:46.250]  Sir, I don't have a number.
[00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:56.276]  Visa Waiver Program... So when I ask you how many visa overstays of the Visa Waiver Program may have traveled to Syria before they got here, do you know that number?
[00:02:59.204 --> 00:03:13.208]  Sir, if a Visa Waiver Program national has, a citizen of a Visa Waiver Program country, rather, has traveled to Syria, Iraq, or a conflict zone, and they're considered a foreign fighter, that VWP country... Not asking that.
[00:03:13.208 --> 00:03:15.029]  I'm saying someone from Great Britain...
[00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:21.795]  Someone from Great Britain comes to the United States on a visa waiver program and they're now an overstay.
[00:03:21.795 --> 00:03:31.305]  Do we know if that person who's here today, maybe they're not even an overstay, do we know if that person has been to Syria before they came to the United States?
[00:03:31.305 --> 00:03:32.846]  Do we know that?
[00:03:32.846 --> 00:03:35.849]  I mean, I know this is what our bill that we just passed earlier this week is trying to get to.
[00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:38.292]  I'm asking, do we know that fact or that information now?
[00:03:39.212 --> 00:03:44.814]  So that's why we have the IC involved, and there's intelligence assessments, and we use... I wasn't asking that.
[00:03:44.814 --> 00:03:45.655]  Do we know that?
[00:03:45.655 --> 00:03:47.916]  Do you know the number?
[00:03:47.916 --> 00:03:54.058]  I don't know the number, but that's why I'm trying to... But do we have people who are in that category I just described?
[00:03:54.058 --> 00:04:01.682]  Come from a Visa Waiver Program country, they're here today, and may have been in Syria or Iraq or somewhere there in the last...
[00:04:02.762 --> 00:04:03.843]  Before they came here.
[00:04:03.843 --> 00:04:04.283]  Do we know that?
[00:04:04.283 --> 00:04:15.253]  If a citizen of a VWP country has traveled to one of those areas, there's a nexus to the United States, or the VWP partners shared that information with us, yes, we know that information, and we will vet against it.
[00:04:15.253 --> 00:04:17.015]  We will also use our algorithm to track them for travel.
[00:04:17.015 --> 00:04:17.756]  But could they be here right now?
[00:04:17.756 --> 00:04:20.438]  Could they be here right now is my question.
[00:04:20.438 --> 00:04:23.301]  I don't have that answer, sir.
[00:04:23.301 --> 00:04:27.404]  Alright, well, how about...
[00:04:28.956 --> 00:04:32.141]  Can you tell me anything about the no-fly list then?
[00:04:32.141 --> 00:04:34.445]  Can you tell me anything about those?
[00:04:34.445 --> 00:04:38.732]  How does a person get put on the criteria for that?
[00:04:38.732 --> 00:04:39.733]  Can you tell me anything about that?
[00:04:41.038 --> 00:04:47.182]  Sure, the no-fly list is a subset of the overall terrorist screening database.
[00:04:47.182 --> 00:04:48.943]  The interagency works together.
[00:04:48.943 --> 00:04:53.486]  The terrorist screening database is owned and operated by the terrorist screening center, as I said earlier.
[00:04:53.486 --> 00:04:56.287]  There are criteria to get on that that are...
[00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.622]  Hillary Clinton wants to censor people who make fun of her.
[00:05:02.622 --> 00:05:08.607]  She was recently trying to censor comedy skits that poked fun at her, which were produced by the Laugh Factory in Los Angeles, California.
[00:05:08.607 --> 00:05:15.173]  The owner of the Laugh Factory, Jamie Masada, told Judicial Watch that her campaign threatened to put him out of business if he didn't pull the videos.
[00:05:15.393 --> 00:05:24.263]  So in response to this attack on free speech, InfoWars.com has launched the Make Fun of Hillary Defend the First Amendment contest with a first place cash prize of $5,000.

[00:06:00.051 --> 00:06:03.553]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.

[00:06:11.818 --> 00:06:17.222]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[00:06:33.362 --> 00:06:38.365]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[00:06:38.365 --> 00:06:40.046]  There's always hidden additives in your food.
[00:06:40.046 --> 00:06:41.647]  Even organic food has hidden additives.
[00:06:41.647 --> 00:06:45.129]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:46.830]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:48.031]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[00:06:48.031 --> 00:06:49.232]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[00:06:49.232 --> 00:06:51.214]  It has natural things that do it clean.

[00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:03.025]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[00:07:03.025 --> 00:07:04.727]  Deep cleanse by InfoWarsLife.com.

[00:07:27.111 --> 00:07:35.998]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades-old scientific research to put together the Rolls-Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[00:07:35.998 --> 00:07:43.083]  Look, there's a reason Deep Cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary Spite G-Rex herbal processing technique.

[00:07:48.587 --> 00:07:50.949]  People should not be afraid of their governments.
[00:07:50.949 --> 00:07:53.231]  Governments should be afraid of their people.
[00:08:42.134 --> 00:08:44.473]  The whole party members have been murdered, Jesus Christ.
[00:08:51.462 --> 00:08:55.946]  We're interrupting your regularly scheduled program to bring you this terrifying report.
[00:08:55.946 --> 00:08:58.988]  It was almost as if it were a planned implosion.
[00:08:58.988 --> 00:09:00.990]  It just pancaked.
[00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:05.014]  Jane, what more can you tell us about the Salomon Brothers building and its collapse?
[00:09:05.014 --> 00:09:07.816]  New York, very much a city still in chaos.
[00:09:07.816 --> 00:09:12.100]  The phones are not working properly, the subway lines are not working properly.
[00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:16.904]  The sky now black with smoke in front of us, just across the Tigris River here.
[00:09:17.464 --> 00:09:22.047]  This is shock and awe, Tom, for the population of Baghdad.
[00:09:22.047 --> 00:09:24.628]  Shock and awe, indeed.
[00:09:24.628 --> 00:09:30.592]  The people you liberate will witness the honorable and decent spirit of the American military.
[00:09:30.592 --> 00:09:33.894]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:09:33.894 --> 00:09:36.776]  Come on!
[00:09:36.776 --> 00:09:38.176]  It is a big idea.
[00:09:38.176 --> 00:09:40.037]  A new world order.
[00:09:40.037 --> 00:09:40.778]  I love my dad.
[00:09:42.012 --> 00:09:43.014]  I'd kill for him.
[00:09:43.014 --> 00:09:45.397]  I'd go to prison for him because I love him so much.
[00:09:45.397 --> 00:09:46.459]  I love Bill Clinton.
[00:09:46.459 --> 00:09:49.603]  What does that make Hillary Clinton to the Bush family?
[00:09:49.603 --> 00:09:50.505]  My sister-in-law.
[00:09:50.505 --> 00:09:56.393]  When you are subverting the power of government, that's a fundamentally dangerous thing to democracy.
[00:09:56.393 --> 00:09:57.775]  What do you think of Edward Snowden?
[00:09:58.676 --> 00:09:59.717]  I think he's a traitor.
[00:09:59.717 --> 00:10:01.579]  Obama is the one that kills the U.S.
[00:10:01.579 --> 00:10:03.381]  troops if the Russians bomb any of them.
[00:10:03.381 --> 00:10:05.503]  Obama is the one that put them in harm's way.
[00:10:05.503 --> 00:10:07.805]  Obama is the one using them as human shields.
[00:10:07.805 --> 00:10:12.169]  It is the most corrupt, degenerate, criminal government in American history.
[00:10:12.169 --> 00:10:13.170]  I'm here to warn people!
[00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:14.711]  You keep telling me to shut up!
[00:10:14.711 --> 00:10:15.572]  This isn't a game!
[00:10:15.572 --> 00:10:20.216]  Get out!
[00:10:20.216 --> 00:10:20.857]  Get out!
[00:10:20.857 --> 00:10:21.297]  Get out!
[00:10:21.297 --> 00:10:22.418]  Welcome to America, ISIS!
[00:10:22.418 --> 00:10:23.219]  This is what we do!
[00:10:23.219 --> 00:10:23.279]  Woo!
[00:10:24.338 --> 00:10:27.380]  We got people that have taken your asses out in this building right now.
[00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:29.122]  We're armed to the teeth, and we're not scared.
[00:10:29.122 --> 00:10:30.863]  You got that, you sons of bitches?
[00:10:30.863 --> 00:10:40.411]  In 2012, your agency was saying, quote, the Salafists, the Muslim Brotherhood, and Al-Qaeda in Iraq are the major forces driving the insurgents in Syria.
[00:10:40.411 --> 00:10:41.332]  In 2012, the U.S.
[00:10:41.332 --> 00:10:44.494]  was helping coordinate arms transfers to those same groups.
[00:10:44.494 --> 00:10:45.655]  And why did you not stop that?
[00:10:45.655 --> 00:10:47.096]  Why didn't you come forward before?
[00:10:47.096 --> 00:10:48.437]  What were you waiting for?
[00:10:48.437 --> 00:10:51.300]  Well, for you, Inspector, I needed you.
[00:10:58.203 --> 00:11:03.044]  I suddenly had this feeling that everything was connected.
[00:11:03.044 --> 00:11:08.085]  We're all part of it.
[00:11:08.085 --> 00:11:11.286]  Are we ready for it?
[00:11:11.286 --> 00:11:20.868]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:11:20.868 --> 00:11:22.349]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is.
[00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:26.131]  Friday, December 11, 2015.
[00:11:26.131 --> 00:11:28.213]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:11:28.213 --> 00:11:32.615]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours and 50 plus minutes.
[00:11:32.615 --> 00:11:35.316]  We now, of course, have added the fourth hour.
[00:11:35.316 --> 00:11:39.779]  David Knight will be hosting today with a lot of breaking news and analysis in the fourth hour.
[00:11:39.779 --> 00:11:47.003]  Alex Newman, reporter for the New American Magazine, the John Birch Society, will be reporting from on the ground for 30 minutes with us.
[00:11:47.563 --> 00:12:01.432]  At the start of the next hour at the key global government conference that we've been covering for the last two weeks that wraps up reportedly at the end of this weekend with a serious global government treaty, the most egregious ever seen publicly.
[00:12:01.432 --> 00:12:02.733]  A lot of it is also secret.
[00:12:02.733 --> 00:12:06.776]  He'll be joining us from Paris, Mike Norris, filmmaker,
[00:12:09.073 --> 00:12:20.902]  Documentary filmmaker, one of the, of course, directors on a lot of Chuck Norris' movies, son of Chuck Norris, will be joining us in studio popping in today.
[00:12:20.902 --> 00:12:34.213]  He invited me with others earlier this year to be part of a pretty high-budget movie, comparatively speaking, to expose the globalist One World Government agenda.
[00:12:35.242 --> 00:12:42.926]  And so I'm honored to be part of the film, and we're going to be premiering the trailer for the documentary.
[00:12:42.926 --> 00:12:47.288]  I call it a documentary.
[00:12:47.288 --> 00:12:52.191]  It's a fiction piece, but it really documents what the globalist plan is overall.
[00:12:52.191 --> 00:12:58.514]  It's a little bit tongue-in-cheek statement coming up at the bottom of the second hour today.
[00:12:58.514 --> 00:13:00.876]  We will premiere that trailer.
[00:13:00.876 --> 00:13:02.676]  It will also be up on InfoWars.com.
[00:13:04.514 --> 00:13:11.076]  And PrisonPlanet.com will premiere the trailer, tell you the name of the film, and a lot more when he joins us in studio.
[00:13:11.076 --> 00:13:18.578]  And then, of course, as I said, David Knight coming up.
[00:13:18.578 --> 00:13:26.640]  A lot of times this happens to me, but as I've said many times in the past, it would only happen a couple times a year.
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:31.361]  Now it's happening every couple days, sometimes several times per day.
[00:13:32.577 --> 00:13:41.625]  Where I'm looking at admissions, I'm looking at government statements, I'm looking at confirmed info.
[00:13:41.625 --> 00:13:52.915]  And it's so over the top that I can't believe that it isn't bringing this criminal government completely down and restoring our republic.
[00:13:52.915 --> 00:13:58.420]  We've seen the former head of defense intelligence and three other generals in the last two months
[00:13:59.451 --> 00:14:03.695]  Two and a half months go public and say our government created ISIS.
[00:14:03.695 --> 00:14:04.996]  We've been ordered to support them.
[00:14:04.996 --> 00:14:06.357]  We've been ordered to fund them.
[00:14:06.357 --> 00:14:07.098]  It's horrible.
[00:14:07.098 --> 00:14:07.818]  It's illegal.
[00:14:07.818 --> 00:14:08.699]  It's criminal.
[00:14:08.699 --> 00:14:10.621]  I don't know why the president's doing this.
[00:14:10.621 --> 00:14:11.461]  It's hurting U.S.
[00:14:11.461 --> 00:14:12.162]  interest.
[00:14:12.162 --> 00:14:13.823]  It's immoral.
[00:14:13.823 --> 00:14:18.768]  And then you see the Huffington Post and New York Magazine and the New York Times and the L.A.
[00:14:18.768 --> 00:14:22.311]  Times and it's the headline, top generals say we screwed up.
[00:14:23.689 --> 00:14:25.590]  And help create ISIS.
[00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:27.331]  No, there was no screwing up.
[00:14:27.331 --> 00:14:34.015]  These generals have said specifically they were ordered to do this and it was wrong.
[00:14:34.015 --> 00:14:42.240]  That alone is just so nakedly sensational that it makes my head spin.
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:43.421]  There's the headline, former D.I.
[00:14:43.421 --> 00:14:44.381]  director, U.S.
[00:14:44.381 --> 00:14:47.163]  made willful decision to support ISIS in Syria.
[00:14:48.874 --> 00:14:50.015]  And why is that important?
[00:14:50.015 --> 00:14:51.176]  Well, it's not just immoral.
[00:14:51.176 --> 00:14:52.056]  It's not just evil.
[00:14:52.056 --> 00:14:52.997]  It's not just wrong.
[00:14:52.997 --> 00:14:57.400]  It doesn't just destabilize things.
[00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:01.163]  But they've been caught doing it.
[00:15:01.163 --> 00:15:03.724]  And where are the congressional hearings?
[00:15:03.724 --> 00:15:09.568]  Well, most of the Republican leadership is involved in all this, just as much as Obama is.
[00:15:09.568 --> 00:15:10.889]  Just as much as Hillary is.
[00:15:10.889 --> 00:15:11.850]  Well, not as much as Hillary.
[00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:14.872]  She actually ran it herself, hands-on, so that's not correct.
[00:15:14.872 --> 00:15:16.013]  No one's more involved than Hillary.
[00:15:16.013 --> 00:15:16.974]  Excuse me.
[00:15:16.974 --> 00:15:17.434]  Just a fact.
[00:15:23.874 --> 00:15:35.437]  So we have General Michael Flynn, all these others coming out, and then I have articles like this one out of Defense One, putting out disinfo to the public, saying,
[00:15:37.366 --> 00:15:37.967]  The U.S.
[00:15:37.967 --> 00:16:00.085]  is funding billions to fight ISIS, and then it lists the groups, and almost every group on there is admittedly running and funding and giving the weapons to ISIS, including Saudi Arabia, that just got $24 billion since last year.
[00:16:00.085 --> 00:16:00.946]  This is truly sick.
[00:16:02.824 --> 00:16:07.607]  This is how illiterate, politically, the public is, that they could get away with stuff like this.
[00:16:07.607 --> 00:16:10.208]  I mean, this is crazy!
[00:16:10.208 --> 00:16:12.510]  And I can't believe, where are the so-called liberals?
[00:16:14.448 --> 00:16:21.410]  I mean, if George Bush was trying stuff like this, they would have been pulling their hair out and running down the street naked screaming, and they should have.
[00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:28.651]  Bush was doing some really bad stuff, and I was against it, and I was speaking out against it, and was called a communist by neocon publications.
[00:16:28.651 --> 00:16:30.632]  I'm not a communist, I'm an American.
[00:16:30.632 --> 00:16:32.192]  I don't support war crimes.
[00:16:32.192 --> 00:16:39.334]  I don't support destabilizing countries and overthrowing our allies and mass murdering people.
[00:16:39.334 --> 00:16:40.594]  And torture and all the rest of it.
[00:16:42.128 --> 00:16:48.794]  Because none of it's done to begin with to protect us, and it's immoral.
[00:16:48.794 --> 00:16:54.559]  Now, I say that because that's just one example of a story this year that's so naked.
[00:16:54.559 --> 00:16:57.281]  We now have these reports from, again, the Daily Caller.
[00:16:57.281 --> 00:17:01.645]  We had Tucker Carlson on yesterday, and I was real nice to him.
[00:17:01.645 --> 00:17:07.470]  And some people email me or ask me, hey, you used to bash Tucker Carlson when he was at MSNBC and then some at Fox.
[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:12.284]  Well, that's because he was more of a mainline libertarian conservative then.
[00:17:12.284 --> 00:17:16.048]  The work he does at Daily Caller is really groundbreaking every day.
[00:17:17.475 --> 00:17:25.323]  And so I, as I said, I admire the Daily Caller, and I admire his reporters, and I admire him getting more hardcore.
[00:17:25.323 --> 00:17:36.833]  You know, we gotta get to the point where when people start coming over to our side and start to get more realistic and start to get more bold, to not then just run them off because sometime back in the past they weren't perfect.
[00:17:36.833 --> 00:17:40.917]  I'm here to win this war against the globalists, not sit up here like a Pharisee
[00:17:42.099 --> 00:17:49.682]  Or some pontiff, you know, who's arrogantly saying, I have all the answers and everybody else can just go to hell.
[00:17:49.682 --> 00:17:53.823]  I used to be ignorant, folks, 20 plus years ago.
[00:17:53.823 --> 00:17:58.425]  I was a mainline Republican slash libertarian.
[00:17:58.425 --> 00:18:02.866]  But Ron Paul was my radicalizer to a great extent.
[00:18:02.866 --> 00:18:07.288]  And look, I'm radical compared to Ron Paul today.
[00:18:07.288 --> 00:18:09.648]  And yes, we are radicalizing Donald Trump.
[00:18:09.648 --> 00:18:10.849]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:18:13.029 --> 00:18:22.696]  I'm not going to give the Washington Post or the New York Times or others who've been calling me a quote on inside baseball, but I'm here to win.
[00:18:22.696 --> 00:18:27.139]  I'm here to take action.
[00:18:27.139 --> 00:18:31.462]  I'm here to try to really set brush fires in the minds of men and women to want to have liberty.
[00:18:31.462 --> 00:18:33.884]  And did I like the Donald Trump of 10 years ago?
[00:18:33.884 --> 00:18:34.444]  Not so much.
[00:18:34.444 --> 00:18:35.385]  Do I like the one of today?
[00:18:35.385 --> 00:18:36.106]  Yes.
[00:18:36.106 --> 00:18:38.607]  And it's a process of waking people up.
[00:18:38.607 --> 00:18:40.109]  The climate has changed.
[00:18:40.109 --> 00:18:41.690]  People are choosing sides right now.
[00:18:42.819 --> 00:18:47.142]  And we've got to basically realize we could defeat the globalists.
[00:18:47.142 --> 00:18:51.105]  We could overthrow their system and restore freedom.
[00:18:51.105 --> 00:18:55.688]  But the bought and paid for churches and government systems tell you things are only going to get worse.
[00:18:55.688 --> 00:18:57.109]  It's a foregone conclusion.
[00:18:57.109 --> 00:18:58.009]  Submit to tyranny.
[00:18:58.009 --> 00:19:00.331]  That's the way it is.
[00:19:00.331 --> 00:19:01.892]  Assume a fetal position.
[00:19:01.892 --> 00:19:03.513]  Stick a thumb in your mouth.
[00:19:03.513 --> 00:19:04.854]  Stick the other one someplace else.
[00:19:04.854 --> 00:19:06.735]  That should be the new national flag.
[00:19:06.735 --> 00:19:10.318]  A person in a fetal position sucking their thumb and sitting on the other one.
[00:19:11.493 --> 00:19:18.516]  With a pink rainbow and Caitlyn Jenner hoisting the flag on a pile of dead babies at Planned Parenthood.
[00:19:18.516 --> 00:19:22.137]  I mean, seriously, this is not who we are.
[00:19:22.137 --> 00:19:30.120]  All we've got to do is advertise the Americana culture that's still there up against this globalist death culture and it's game over.
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:31.601]  People want prosperity.
[00:19:31.601 --> 00:19:33.142]  They want freedom.
[00:19:33.142 --> 00:19:35.342]  They want men to be men, women to be women.
[00:19:35.342 --> 00:19:36.343]  They want people to have fun.
[00:19:38.018 --> 00:19:40.741]  Work hard, play hard, to quote Ted Nugent.
[00:19:40.741 --> 00:19:43.924]  That's what folks want, and we're sick of it.
[00:19:43.924 --> 00:19:48.188]  Women want men that wear pants.
[00:19:48.188 --> 00:19:51.512]  Real simple stuff like that, and those are Trump cards nobody can beat.
[00:19:51.512 --> 00:19:57.938]  We come back, mega bombshell whistleblowers on what we already knew about San Bernardino, but now it's confirmed.
[00:19:57.938 --> 00:19:59.039]  This is big.
[00:20:00.959 --> 00:20:02.340]  911, what is your emergency?
[00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:03.861]  There's somebody in my house.

[00:21:43.367 --> 00:21:45.428]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[00:21:45.428 --> 00:21:48.370]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:51.035]  Heart and Body Extract gets results.

[00:22:03.731 --> 00:22:05.432]  And they're getting worse.

[00:22:59.355 --> 00:23:02.680]  My name is Bill Bonner, and I have an important message.
[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:10.450]  Right now, the highest levels of government are struggling against an inevitable crisis, but they're about to lose control.
[00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:15.397]  When this happens, it will rip our country apart in ways you never imagined.
[00:23:15.737 --> 00:23:20.340]  From where we shop, to the doctors you visit, and the family you want to protect.
[00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:22.742]  Look, I've made predictions like this before.
[00:23:22.742 --> 00:23:26.565]  A few years ago, I warned that the housing prices would collapse.
[00:23:26.565 --> 00:23:31.108]  Before that, I warned that dot-com companies would crash, and they did.
[00:23:31.108 --> 00:23:34.230]  Those who listened had a chance to save themselves.
[00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:36.812]  But this has nothing to do with the stock market.
[00:23:36.812 --> 00:23:38.093]  This will affect us all.
[00:23:38.653 --> 00:23:43.377]  I've posted a free video at DollarDanger.com.
[00:23:43.377 --> 00:23:49.783]  Maybe you'll disagree with my conclusions, but first you need to watch this video and see the facts for yourself.

[00:23:55.888 --> 00:24:03.915]  Again, that's DollarDanger.com.
[00:24:03.915 --> 00:24:04.616]  I have sworn.
[00:24:06.255 --> 00:24:11.218]  I have sworn on the altar of God.
[00:24:18.994 --> 00:24:23.959]  Resistance against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[00:24:23.959 --> 00:24:33.748]  Thomas Jefferson said that more than 240 years ago and today it rings truer than ever because truth is bulletproof.
[00:24:33.748 --> 00:24:36.410]  Truth is eternal.
[00:24:36.410 --> 00:24:43.637]  Truth stands on its own evergreen throughout all times, all dimensions.
[00:24:47.064 --> 00:24:48.207]  I am your host Alex Jones.
[00:24:48.207 --> 00:24:49.770]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:24:49.770 --> 00:24:50.572]  We're shifting it around.
[00:24:50.572 --> 00:24:53.979]  Mike Norris is going to be here in the third hour today.
[00:24:55.916 --> 00:25:01.601]  Announcing and premiering a trailer for a new anti-New World Order film that he and others have produced.
[00:25:01.601 --> 00:25:19.976]  But before we go there and break all that down, and before we get into the latest huge whistleblower news that's as big as Benghazi, as big as any of these events, for what it exposes, the big breaking news right now is Anonymous goes after Donald Trump.
[00:25:19.976 --> 00:25:21.056]  And people have always asked me,
[00:25:22.105 --> 00:25:24.266]  Am I for anonymous or against it?
[00:25:24.266 --> 00:25:25.567]  Well, it's anonymous.
[00:25:25.567 --> 00:25:29.188]  It's like saying, am I for people wearing masks on their faces or I'm against it?
[00:25:29.188 --> 00:25:31.569]  No, sometimes I'd be for it, sometimes I'm against it.
[00:25:31.569 --> 00:25:33.810]  Are there good groups calling themselves anonymous?
[00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:34.831]  Are there bad groups?
[00:25:34.831 --> 00:25:37.332]  Yes.
[00:25:37.332 --> 00:25:46.436]  Overall, I think most work that's been done by anonymous, which is just the people, it's not an organization, folks kind of think of it as a group of people in a bunker somewhere.
[00:25:46.436 --> 00:25:48.177]  Most of what I've seen anonymous do has been good.
[00:25:49.107 --> 00:25:54.231]  But it's also something governments and corrupt corporations use to do things.
[00:25:54.231 --> 00:25:56.372]  Donald Trump's website's been taken down.
[00:25:56.372 --> 00:25:58.434]  There's all these calls for censorship against him.
[00:25:58.434 --> 00:26:00.695]  There's these calls for banning him from going to Europe.
[00:26:00.695 --> 00:26:01.856]  There's calls to kill him.
[00:26:01.856 --> 00:26:05.219]  ACLU officials have called for killing Trump voters.
[00:26:05.219 --> 00:26:08.421]  This is all in my stack today.
[00:26:08.421 --> 00:26:11.223]  All he's called for is what Jimmy Carter did.
[00:26:11.223 --> 00:26:16.527]  He didn't say, like Franklin Delano Roosevelt said, round up all the Japanese, round up all the Muslims.
[00:26:16.527 --> 00:26:17.788]  I'd be against that if he said that.
[00:26:19.209 --> 00:26:22.492]  But as you're going to see with these whistleblowers, they were in that mosque.
[00:26:22.492 --> 00:26:26.175]  They were targeting Farouk and Malik.
[00:26:26.175 --> 00:26:27.877]  That's the breaking news.
[00:26:27.877 --> 00:26:29.958]  They knew the training camp she'd gone to.
[00:26:29.958 --> 00:26:31.680]  They tried to stop her getting back in.
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:34.622]  And did you know it got killed from the White House?
[00:26:34.622 --> 00:26:39.146]  That's Homeland Security and FBI whistleblowers today.
[00:26:39.146 --> 00:26:40.808]  Should be the number one story in the country.
[00:26:40.808 --> 00:26:43.110]  In fact, I want to direct my reporters to get on this.
[00:26:44.462 --> 00:26:47.624]  You can work on whatever else you want, but I rarely say, hey, get on this.
[00:26:47.624 --> 00:26:54.248]  We need to be reporting on and ferreting in to what Daily Caller is getting into.
[00:26:54.248 --> 00:26:56.510]  But separately, oh, you're so proud of yourself.
[00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:59.391]  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar says he's helping ISIS when he's fighting it.
[00:27:01.803 --> 00:27:05.526]  The fake Rick Ross jail guard that preys on black people for MTV.
[00:27:05.526 --> 00:27:06.987]  Rick Ross, the fake one.
[00:27:06.987 --> 00:27:08.248]  You know, says, kill Trump.
[00:27:08.248 --> 00:27:11.390]  Oh, you're so hard when you weren't, you know, locking black people up.
[00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:12.671]  You're so cool.
[00:27:12.671 --> 00:27:15.533]  Now you teach them how to be thugs so you can lock them up again.
[00:27:15.533 --> 00:27:17.594]  You work for the man, don't you, Judas Goat?
[00:27:17.594 --> 00:27:19.876]  Big ol' fat punk.
[00:27:19.876 --> 00:27:21.857]  Rick Ross.
[00:27:21.857 --> 00:27:23.058]  Steals people's identities.
[00:27:23.058 --> 00:27:24.539]  Big ol' nobody.
[00:27:24.539 --> 00:27:26.280]  Excuse me, I don't want to go off into a rant.
[00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:27.901]  It just makes me sick.
[00:27:27.901 --> 00:27:28.502]  Kill Trump.
[00:27:28.502 --> 00:27:29.482]  He gets away with that.
[00:27:29.482 --> 00:27:30.203]  He's a scumbag.
[00:27:32.657 --> 00:27:36.839]  See, Rick Ross locks black people up.
[00:27:36.839 --> 00:27:39.900]  Donald Trump buys golf courses and opens them up to black people.
[00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:42.041]  But that's the difference, see?
[00:27:42.041 --> 00:27:43.682]  Obama doubles black unemployment.
[00:27:43.682 --> 00:27:46.503]  Donald Trump wants to boost black employment.
[00:27:46.503 --> 00:27:51.105]  Show he gets a big old government thug like the fake Rick Ross that called for killing him!
[00:27:51.105 --> 00:27:53.766]  Because he's a little punk fake gangster.
[00:27:53.766 --> 00:27:56.467]  See how this turns out for you, you punk?
[00:27:56.467 --> 00:27:58.268]  Excuse me, I'm really getting angry.
[00:27:58.268 --> 00:27:59.709]  Anonymous goes after Donald Trump.
[00:28:00.794 --> 00:28:04.818]  What do you mean, the Democratic Party, Republican Party?
[00:28:04.818 --> 00:28:19.691]  Hacker Collective Anonymous, the media wants to act like this is a collective against Trump, seems to be targeting Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump after the real estate tycoon called for a ban on all Muslims entering the United States.
[00:28:19.691 --> 00:28:26.537]  I'll give the full quote, until they check the visas and verify them and anybody else who hadn't been checked.
[00:28:26.537 --> 00:28:27.678]  But that's a whole lot of context.
[00:28:29.252 --> 00:28:41.808]  One of the Twitter accounts of the hacker group said that it briefly took down Trump Tower New York City.com earlier and the group has also seemingly posted a YouTube video warning Trump.
[00:28:43.123 --> 00:28:53.630]  Yeah, you mean they use the same video that people have been using for five years, that somebody else cut, and put your words over it, sitting there saying, you better watch it, you better do what we say.
[00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:54.931]  I mean, this is a sick joke.
[00:28:54.931 --> 00:28:58.314]  And the media, again, acts like it's a hacktivist community altogether.
[00:28:58.314 --> 00:29:02.196]  It's just somebody claiming they're with Anonymous, which, again, is a cutout.
[00:29:02.196 --> 00:29:04.018]  Let's go to the warning from Anonymous.
[00:29:04.018 --> 00:29:04.398]  Here it is.
[00:29:05.237 --> 00:29:12.280]  Anonymous, Donald Trump, it has come to our attention that you want to ban all Muslims to enter the United States.
[00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:15.042]  This policy is going to have a huge impact.
[00:29:15.042 --> 00:29:16.923]  This is what ISIS wants.
[00:29:16.923 --> 00:29:21.165]  The more Muslims feel sad, the more ISIS feel that they can recruit them.
[00:29:21.165 --> 00:29:29.849]  The more United States appears to be targeting Muslims, not just radical Muslims, you can be sure that ISIS would put that up on their social media campaign.
[00:29:29.849 --> 00:29:32.890]  Donald Trump, think twice before you speak anything.
[00:29:32.890 --> 00:29:34.751]  You have been warned, Mr. Donald Trump.
[00:29:35.171 --> 00:29:36.492]  We are anonymous.
[00:29:36.492 --> 00:29:37.553]  We are Legion.
[00:29:37.553 --> 00:29:39.015]  We do not forgive.
[00:29:39.015 --> 00:29:40.356]  Expect us.
[00:29:40.356 --> 00:29:41.097]  We're going to break.
[00:29:41.097 --> 00:29:44.740]  That is a direct White House line that he's helping ISIS.
[00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:46.902]  That was probably produced by the White House.
[00:29:46.902 --> 00:29:49.465]  What a group of cowardly filth.
[00:29:49.465 --> 00:29:50.866]  We're on the march.
[00:29:50.866 --> 00:29:53.388]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.388 --> 00:29:56.071]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.299 --> 00:30:08.921]  A recent hearing on climate change featuring three prominent scientists who are actually skeptical of man-made global warming resulted in a heated exchange.
[00:30:08.921 --> 00:30:14.603]  Massachusetts Senator Ed Markey invoked Galileo when he harped, the science is settled.
[00:30:14.603 --> 00:30:25.306]  Essentially calling climatologist Judith Curry a denier for believing that this could be something God made rather than something that is man-made and backed by science.
[00:30:25.746 --> 00:30:28.787]  Are you saying there's no natural variability, Senator?
[00:30:28.787 --> 00:30:31.328]  There were alligators at the North Pole.
[00:30:31.328 --> 00:30:32.028]  What was that?
[00:30:32.028 --> 00:30:33.688]  Was that you in your SUV?
[00:30:33.688 --> 00:30:37.850]  And be prepared for the climate change cult to be even more in your face.
[00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:41.631]  The UN announced the organization of a civil society PR campaign.
[00:30:42.071 --> 00:30:56.996]  This propaganda tsunami will be used to bolster the UN's climate deal, which calls for a $100 billion annual transfer from rich to poor nations, and of course taxes, penalties, and a global police force to guarantee our submission.
[00:30:56.996 --> 00:30:59.597]  Leanne McAdoo reporting for InfoWars.com
[00:31:00.077 --> 00:31:14.687]  My fellow patriots, one of the things I'm most proud of is the fact that the InfoWars operation reaches more than 20 million people a week worldwide with the message of liberty, and none of it is funded by major global corporations or by taxpayers.
[00:31:14.687 --> 00:31:16.508]  It's funded by free will.
[00:31:16.508 --> 00:31:26.535]  Listeners and viewers like you who decide to visit InfoWarsStore.com and take advantage of some of the most high quality revolutionary products available today and now.

[00:31:59.856 --> 00:32:03.338]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:32:03.338 --> 00:32:11.603]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:32:11.603 --> 00:32:16.606]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:32:17.006 --> 00:32:19.532]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[00:32:29.845 --> 00:32:34.228]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems.
[00:32:34.228 --> 00:32:38.370]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com Oil of Oregano Formulation.
[00:32:38.370 --> 00:32:43.333]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.
[00:32:43.333 --> 00:32:47.995]  Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy to use capsules.
[00:32:47.995 --> 00:32:51.457]  You will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[00:32:51.457 --> 00:32:54.919]  Now available in our limited first run at Infowarslife.com.
[00:32:54.919 --> 00:32:56.740]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:33:03.729 --> 00:33:06.530]  In the Councils of Government.
[00:33:06.530 --> 00:33:17.476]  In the Councils of Government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial conspiracy theorists.
[00:33:17.476 --> 00:33:22.959]  In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown Dallas.
[00:33:22.959 --> 00:33:29.402]  The press reports say that President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by this shooting.
[00:33:29.402 --> 00:33:30.823]  It is a big idea.
[00:33:30.823 --> 00:33:32.003]  A new world order.
[00:33:36.459 --> 00:33:38.903]  It was almost as if it were planned in post.
[00:33:38.903 --> 00:33:40.165]  It's just pancakes.
[00:33:40.165 --> 00:33:44.452]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:33:44.452 --> 00:33:50.943]  You're either with us, or you're a racist.
[00:34:00.697 --> 00:34:05.100]  I also believe that a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals.
[00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:10.605]  Guns will be taken.
[00:34:10.605 --> 00:34:11.986]  No one will be able to be off.
[00:34:11.986 --> 00:34:14.348]  We're going to take all of them.
[00:34:14.348 --> 00:34:19.151]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city.
[00:34:19.151 --> 00:34:20.732]  Global governance at last.
[00:34:20.732 --> 00:34:21.733]  Is it one world?
[00:34:21.733 --> 00:34:23.194]  The central bank is in charge.
[00:34:23.194 --> 00:34:27.057]  But aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?
[00:34:27.057 --> 00:34:27.618]  As for me!
[00:34:29.642 --> 00:34:33.283]  Or give me death!
[00:34:33.283 --> 00:34:39.404]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:34:39.404 --> 00:34:41.865]  And it's Friday, the 11th day of December, 2015.
[00:34:41.865 --> 00:34:43.665]  I am your host.
[00:34:43.665 --> 00:34:48.746]  We've got filmmaker, actor, you name it.
[00:34:48.746 --> 00:34:53.287]  Chuck Norris' son, Mike Norris, joining us to launch a new big film trailer.
[00:34:53.287 --> 00:34:54.347]  The first premiere.
[00:34:54.347 --> 00:34:57.628]  We'll announce the name of the film and a lot more coming up.
[00:34:58.533 --> 00:35:09.427]  When he joins us, we also have Alex Newman of the New American Magazine joining us for 30 minutes from Paris, France on the latest in the huge global government conference.
[00:35:09.427 --> 00:35:14.333]  And David Knight will be con-showing the fourth hour today.
[00:35:15.987 --> 00:35:21.890]  Now again, I have praised good organizations and individuals out there that have called themselves anonymous.
[00:35:21.890 --> 00:35:23.891]  The whole point is it's anonymous.
[00:35:23.891 --> 00:35:28.114]  But you have the left trying to continually act like anonymous is run by them.
[00:35:29.549 --> 00:35:34.013]  And that they're against Donald Trump or guns or whatever.
[00:35:34.013 --> 00:35:35.894]  And that's just not the way this works.
[00:35:35.894 --> 00:35:45.542]  Snowden has come out saying more guns and citizens being armed would be the answer to San Bernardino, not NSA spying.
[00:35:45.542 --> 00:35:47.883]  And notice NSA spying didn't protect us.
[00:35:47.883 --> 00:35:52.927]  So here's the king daddy of what you call anonymous.
[00:35:52.927 --> 00:35:54.749]  And he's exposing the government.
[00:35:56.107 --> 00:35:58.228]  That, of course, is Snowden.
[00:35:58.228 --> 00:36:04.450]  Same thing, to a certain extent, but not as good, we see with Julian Assange.
[00:36:04.450 --> 00:36:07.771]  And yes, of course, Snowden is a Ron Paul supporter.
[00:36:07.771 --> 00:36:12.313]  And yes, folks, Snowden is a listener of InfoWars.com.
[00:36:12.313 --> 00:36:13.874]  I can just leave it at that.
[00:36:13.874 --> 00:36:16.234]  And someday you'll hear him here on this show.
[00:36:16.234 --> 00:36:19.876]  I'm not bragging.
[00:36:19.876 --> 00:36:20.776]  I'm just letting you know the facts.
[00:36:20.776 --> 00:36:22.777]  Vladimir Putin is a routine listener and viewer.
[00:36:24.724 --> 00:36:27.986]  Now you know Donald Trump is, Matt Drudge, the list goes on and on.
[00:36:27.986 --> 00:36:33.730]  Not name dropping, letting you know, because you're not well known most of you, that you're not alone.
[00:36:33.730 --> 00:36:36.332]  People are awake, they're awakening.
[00:36:36.332 --> 00:36:42.756]  Is there a large portion of people that don't know what planet they're on and can't find their rear end with both hands?
[00:36:42.756 --> 00:36:44.077]  Absolutely.
[00:36:44.077 --> 00:36:49.160]  But those are poor brainwashed victims set in front of the television from birth in their you-know-what filled diapers.
[00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:51.822]  We should feel sorry for these Matrix Pod children.
[00:36:53.052 --> 00:36:57.655]  These proto-matrix pod children.
[00:36:57.655 --> 00:37:02.119]  Light years worse than latchkey kids living in their own fantasy world.
[00:37:02.119 --> 00:37:04.401]  We're here to break them out of the fantasy.
[00:37:04.401 --> 00:37:06.002]  We're pro-human.
[00:37:06.002 --> 00:37:07.963]  We're pro-Renaissance.
[00:37:07.963 --> 00:37:08.944]  We're pro-empowerment.
[00:37:08.944 --> 00:37:12.667]  We want the real technology that's been developed to be deployed to the general public.
[00:37:12.667 --> 00:37:14.108]  We believe in expanding economies.
[00:37:15.489 --> 00:37:20.632]  We believe expanding economies are good, not bad for the planet, and not bad for humanity.
[00:37:20.632 --> 00:37:22.332]  We're fans of the general public.
[00:37:22.332 --> 00:37:24.894]  We believe in the knowledge of the general public.
[00:37:24.894 --> 00:37:35.079]  We know there's an artificial feedback loop to dumb down humanity that has created a bunch of servile, drooling, mindless idiots who are a danger to other humans who are not under globalist control.
[00:37:35.879 --> 00:37:51.526]  Under globalist spell, under globalist mesmerization, under globalist hypnotism, under globalist psychosis, under globalist programming with hypnotic suggestions and hypnotic trigger words.
[00:37:51.526 --> 00:37:58.629]  We are conscious, sentient beings that wish to direct our destiny, our development, our evolution.
[00:37:59.602 --> 00:38:13.553]  And they use that word because controlled Christians are even mad at the word evolution in their own political correctness, just like they're trying to ban the word lynch out of the name of buildings, saying it means lynch black people, even though it's an Irish name.
[00:38:13.553 --> 00:38:16.415]  We need to change the name then of the Attorney General.
[00:38:16.415 --> 00:38:18.336]  And by the way, I'm not joking.
[00:38:18.336 --> 00:38:23.861]  If you just tuned in, I learned after yesterday, it's not just colleges, it's other facilities.
[00:38:23.861 --> 00:38:25.362]  People are saying get rid of the word lynch.
[00:38:28.157 --> 00:38:32.779]  College crybabies in Pennsylvania demand racist Lynch Memorial Hall be renamed.
[00:38:32.779 --> 00:38:38.181]  Not because the guy it's named after, Lynch, was racist, but because the word Lynch they associate with racism.
[00:38:38.181 --> 00:38:40.642]  No, it's the Lynch case in the U.S.
[00:38:40.642 --> 00:38:45.144]  with two family members hanging the son because they thought he committed a crime.
[00:38:45.144 --> 00:38:51.647]  They passed the Lynch laws against lynching, against vigilante justice.
[00:38:52.639 --> 00:38:55.861]  That has affected whites, blacks, you name it.
[00:38:55.861 --> 00:39:00.723]  But again, everything becomes this mindless psychosis to where I use the word evolution.
[00:39:00.723 --> 00:39:08.727]  Cars evolve, computers evolve, infrastructure evolves, architecture evolves, music evolves, or devolves.
[00:39:09.878 --> 00:39:15.923]  And we're in the middle of a de-evolution of culture and society, but also a renaissance in parallel tracks.
[00:39:15.923 --> 00:39:28.873]  And when you choose renaissance, when you choose free will, when you choose true Thomas Jeffersonian liberalism, it trumps in spades over and over again with a royal flush.
[00:39:28.873 --> 00:39:32.596]  It delivers the dead man's hand to the globalists and brings them down.
[00:39:33.450 --> 00:39:36.493]  Your free will is the end of their tyranny.
[00:39:36.493 --> 00:39:53.651]  That's why they want politically correct Obamabots, bleeding like mindless sheep, with no culture, no language, no ideas, just waiting for the latest trendy download to become successful if they could just get the trendiness right, if they could just submit to the cultural Marxism correctly.
[00:39:54.943 --> 00:39:58.986]  Then they might discover a heart, a soul, a will.
[00:39:58.986 --> 00:40:04.489]  They might discover an identity, a family, a culture, a tribe, kinship.
[00:40:04.489 --> 00:40:06.431]  Because what they have is not real.
[00:40:06.431 --> 00:40:07.952]  It is plastic.
[00:40:07.952 --> 00:40:08.832]  It's as phony as a $3 bill.
[00:40:13.365 --> 00:40:21.327]  So Anonymous is quite proud of itself going after Donald Trump because he said we need to start screening these people coming out of these countries.
[00:40:21.327 --> 00:40:22.247]  We don't know who's radical.
[00:40:22.247 --> 00:40:23.727]  We don't know who isn't.
[00:40:23.727 --> 00:40:29.348]  In polls, 25% coming out of Syria said they plan jihad or support it or support suicide bombers.
[00:40:29.348 --> 00:40:30.269]  That is dangerous.
[00:40:30.269 --> 00:40:39.391]  We've got to make Congress and Obama start vetting them, which Congress admits they're not doing, which the FBI admits and DHS admits they're not doing.
[00:40:39.391 --> 00:40:41.031]  And then they asked the head spokeswoman
[00:40:42.193 --> 00:40:43.514]  Let's play this clip first.
[00:40:43.514 --> 00:40:49.677]  Kelly Burselley, or however you pronounce it, they ask her, how's the no-fly list?
[00:40:49.677 --> 00:40:50.878]  And she says, how's it work?
[00:40:50.878 --> 00:40:54.279]  And she says, I know nothing!
[00:40:54.279 --> 00:40:54.920]  Well, we do know.
[00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:57.501]  There's been investigations by the media.
[00:40:57.501 --> 00:40:58.662]  No one knows how you get on it.
[00:40:58.662 --> 00:40:59.942]  You can't get off of it.
[00:40:59.942 --> 00:41:06.006]  And bureaucrats at the DHS, at the White House level, direct who goes on it.
[00:41:06.006 --> 00:41:06.626]  Let's play that clip.
[00:41:08.646 --> 00:41:12.174]  Can you tell me anything about the no-fly list then?
[00:41:12.174 --> 00:41:14.138]  Can't tell me anything about those?
[00:41:14.138 --> 00:41:18.407]  How does a person get put on the criteria for that?
[00:41:18.407 --> 00:41:19.429]  Can you tell me anything about that?
[00:41:20.714 --> 00:41:26.858]  Sure, the no-fly list is a subset of the overall terrorist screening database.
[00:41:26.858 --> 00:41:28.619]  The interagency works together.
[00:41:28.619 --> 00:41:33.982]  The terrorist screening database is owned and operated by the terrorist screening center, as I said earlier.
[00:41:33.982 --> 00:41:37.164]  There are criteria to get on that that are agreed to.
[00:41:37.164 --> 00:41:39.266]  How many American citizens are on that list right now?
[00:41:39.266 --> 00:41:40.246]  Can you give me that number?
[00:41:40.246 --> 00:41:42.388]  How many American citizens are on the no-fly list right now?
[00:41:44.218 --> 00:41:45.839]  I know there are American citizens on the list.
[00:41:45.839 --> 00:41:49.141]  It is an extremely small number, but I don't have my numbers with me.
[00:41:49.141 --> 00:41:51.383]  But again, that's something I can easily get back to you.
[00:42:01.530 --> 00:42:01.890]  No.
[00:42:01.890 --> 00:42:04.932]  The number of visa waiver program overstays, you don't know.
[00:42:04.932 --> 00:42:10.216]  The number of visa waiver overstays who may have been to Syria before they came here, you don't know.
[00:42:10.216 --> 00:42:13.358]  And the number of American citizens on the no-fly list, and you don't know.
[00:42:13.358 --> 00:42:23.926]  And yet you are the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Screening Coordination, Office of Policy, Department of Homeland Security, in front of the Oversight Committee, and you can't give us one single number to some, I think, pretty basic questions?
[00:42:24.684 --> 00:42:30.748]  Some of those statistics aren't held by DHS, and so that's why I would like to work with my interagency partners.
[00:42:30.748 --> 00:42:32.169]  That's why I referenced your title.
[00:42:32.169 --> 00:42:35.671]  You're the one who's the screening coordinator for all this, and you said you were interagency.
[00:42:35.671 --> 00:42:36.852]  That's why I referenced your title.
[00:42:36.852 --> 00:42:39.914]  It seems to me you should, when you come in front of this space, you should have that information.
[00:42:39.914 --> 00:42:40.654]  I'm a DHS employee.
[00:42:40.654 --> 00:42:45.978]  I'm a DHS career civil servant employee, and I will work with my interagency partners
[00:42:47.338 --> 00:42:51.061]  But they're the authoritative source for a lot of those numbers that you mentioned.
[00:42:51.061 --> 00:42:54.443]  If you could get us those numbers and the ones Mr. Russell asked for, that would be very helpful.
[00:42:54.443 --> 00:42:56.904]  I thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[00:42:56.904 --> 00:42:59.826]  She doesn't know what planet she's on.
[00:42:59.826 --> 00:43:11.693]  And that's because they've got a bunch of idiots at the heads of these agencies so the real criminals behind the scenes can rob us seven ways to Sunday and back again.
[00:43:11.693 --> 00:43:13.775]  And all we've done is reverse engineered what they're up to.
[00:43:14.892 --> 00:43:17.133]  This is an internal passport.
[00:43:17.133 --> 00:43:18.633]  The IRS admits it.
[00:43:18.633 --> 00:43:25.516]  They're now passing laws, and have passed one, to not let you leave the country if the IRS just feels like it.
[00:43:25.516 --> 00:43:28.197]  Just like, oh, we just feel like you're on a no-fly list.
[00:43:28.197 --> 00:43:30.498]  We just feel like you're on a no-gun-by list.
[00:43:30.498 --> 00:43:35.039]  And we're not going to say how you get on it, how you get off, how many you're on it.
[00:43:35.039 --> 00:43:36.440]  At its peak, there was over 3 million.
[00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:37.360]  Then they reformed it.
[00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:38.181]  It was like 2.1 million.
[00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:45.423]  Incidentally, it's over two million people, I checked it in the last two years, that have flown back and forth from the U.S.
[00:43:45.423 --> 00:43:46.383]  to Syria.
[00:43:46.383 --> 00:43:48.544]  Who knows how many of them are citizens of what?
[00:43:48.544 --> 00:43:50.525]  Because they just don't have those numbers.
[00:43:50.525 --> 00:43:52.867]  Sorry, of course they do have those numbers.
[00:43:52.867 --> 00:44:01.251]  You know what they use the NSA mainly for, according to top NSA officials we've interviewed that are retired or kicked out?
[00:44:01.251 --> 00:44:02.732]  Thomas Drake, William Binney,
[00:44:06.621 --> 00:44:13.653]  James Bamford, who talked to the experts and wrote a book about it, former Nightline producer, top producer.
[00:44:13.653 --> 00:44:14.695]  Let me list some of the other ones.
[00:44:14.695 --> 00:44:16.057]  I don't want to just say top officials.
[00:44:18.018 --> 00:44:19.498]  Wayne Madsen.
[00:44:19.498 --> 00:44:21.259]  The list goes on and on.
[00:44:21.259 --> 00:44:22.559]  It's time to get Wayne Madsen on.
[00:44:22.559 --> 00:44:23.619]  He works for InfoWars now.
[00:44:23.619 --> 00:44:24.600]  He goes out and does reports for us.
[00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:26.480]  We post his reports daily at InfoWars.com.
[00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:28.721]  I want to get him on basically weekly, guys.
[00:44:28.721 --> 00:44:30.121]  I want Madsen on every week.
[00:44:30.121 --> 00:44:32.201]  At least 30 minutes.
[00:44:32.201 --> 00:44:33.142]  Madsen's so smart.
[00:44:33.142 --> 00:44:38.363]  I mean, he really just... It's good to talk to somebody when I go out to dinner or on air who knows as much as I do or a lot more on many subjects.
[00:44:38.363 --> 00:44:39.283]  It's very refreshing.
[00:44:39.283 --> 00:44:40.043]  I'm not bragging.
[00:44:40.043 --> 00:44:42.544]  It's just so good to know when he's saying stuff.
[00:44:42.544 --> 00:44:43.224]  It's so accurate.
[00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:49.132]  And what do they all tell us?
[00:44:49.132 --> 00:45:03.923]  The main focus of DHS is controlling all the agencies and stopping agencies from stopping real organized crime, money laundering, child kidnapping rings, narcotics being shipped around, all of it.
[00:45:03.923 --> 00:45:13.190]  And to keep them all confused, and the FBI's been on record and others have, you can look it up, where every time they're about to bust a real terrorist group or a real mafia group,
[00:45:14.514 --> 00:45:18.937]  Their investigation gets killed by the DOJ or by the White House.
[00:45:18.937 --> 00:45:22.018]  And that's the big breaking news.
[00:45:22.018 --> 00:45:24.780]  But first, again, this is more of her testimony.
[00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:27.802]  This was the end of her testimony in Congress yesterday.
[00:45:27.802 --> 00:45:36.566]  The spokeswoman, the spokesperson, she can't criticize her because she's daring and brave, like everybody else who has long hair.
[00:45:36.566 --> 00:45:39.548]  And Hillary, too, can't question her because she's a woman.
[00:45:39.548 --> 00:45:40.809]  Here were her final words to the committee.
[00:45:42.541 --> 00:45:44.201]  After he steals the tank.
[00:45:44.201 --> 00:45:44.582]  Oh?
[00:45:44.582 --> 00:45:46.282]  From the Panzer Division.
[00:45:46.282 --> 00:45:46.602]  Oh?
[00:45:46.602 --> 00:45:47.962]  Brings it here into the battle.
[00:45:47.962 --> 00:45:49.643]  Oh, I see nothing!
[00:45:49.643 --> 00:45:51.003]  I was not here!
[00:45:51.003 --> 00:45:57.805]  I did not even get up this morning!
[00:45:57.805 --> 00:45:58.425]  Unbelievable.
[00:45:58.425 --> 00:45:59.605]  I mean, they're worse than that.
[00:45:59.605 --> 00:46:02.066]  At least Sergeant Schultz is funny.
[00:46:04.614 --> 00:46:06.435]  I love Hogan's Heroes.
[00:46:06.435 --> 00:46:08.155]  I tell you, the star of that show liked to party.
[00:46:08.155 --> 00:46:09.916]  That's probably what did him in.
[00:46:09.916 --> 00:46:13.898]  All right, let's continue here, ladies and gentlemen, with the news.
[00:46:13.898 --> 00:46:14.898]  Drumroll, please.
[00:46:14.898 --> 00:46:15.859]  I mean, this is a big deal.
[00:46:15.859 --> 00:46:17.299]  It's getting almost no attention.
[00:46:17.299 --> 00:46:18.620]  DailyCaller.com.
[00:46:18.620 --> 00:46:21.561]  We have it up at Infowars.com.
[00:46:21.561 --> 00:46:22.421]  Whistleblower.
[00:46:22.421 --> 00:46:26.483]  Feds shut down terror investigation that could have prevented San Bernardino attack.
[00:46:28.109 --> 00:46:30.449]  And this is also made on the Fox News.
[00:46:30.449 --> 00:46:36.851]  A former Department of Homeland Security agent says that an investigation he was conducting in a fundamentalist Islamic group operating in the U.S.
[00:46:36.851 --> 00:46:43.052]  may have helped stop the San Bernardino Jihad, Saeed Farooq attack, had the government not shut down his probe.
[00:46:43.052 --> 00:46:52.734]  And you go over it, it was a year ago, it was of the mosque, it was of them, it was of his wife, her going to this Islamicist training Jihad camp in Pakistan.
[00:46:52.734 --> 00:46:54.134]  I mean, they knew how to profile.
[00:46:55.728 --> 00:47:00.550]  The point is, is that this is not workplace violence, this is not mental illness, this is programming in peer pressure.
[00:47:13.837 --> 00:47:17.158]  Just like they put you in the Marine Corps and you learn how to kill.
[00:47:17.158 --> 00:47:19.419]  And you chant about killing all day.
[00:47:19.419 --> 00:47:23.821]  And if you don't act on the killer instinct when the moment comes, YOU WILL BE A DEAD MARINE!
[00:47:23.821 --> 00:47:29.744]  DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME, YOU LOW-LIFE, AMPHIBIOUS GARBAGE?!
[00:47:29.744 --> 00:47:30.484]  Well, it's the same thing.
[00:47:30.484 --> 00:47:34.226]  They send them over to these jihad camps for men and women.
[00:47:34.226 --> 00:47:37.848]  And Obama knows ISIS's secret weapon is brigades of women.
[00:47:37.848 --> 00:47:38.428]  In combat.
[00:47:39.414 --> 00:47:42.738]  Look at Israel, they're having like daily stabbing attacks with women doing it.
[00:47:42.738 --> 00:47:45.380]  And he goes, he's just scared of women and children.
[00:47:45.380 --> 00:47:47.443]  Gave me the kids doing all the stuff films.
[00:47:47.443 --> 00:47:50.125]  The eight and nine and ten year olds blowing people's heads off.
[00:47:50.125 --> 00:47:51.026]  Russian and U.S.
[00:47:51.026 --> 00:47:52.268]  agents that were on the other side of this.
[00:47:57.503 --> 00:48:04.905]  During an interview on the Fox News, Megyn Kelly Thursday, Philip Hanney said that in 2012, right through to last year, an agent of the U.S.
[00:48:04.905 --> 00:48:19.349]  Customs and Border Protection National Targeting Center, Tracking Center, had opened an investigation of the Sunni Islamic group called, and then it goes over, how do you pronounce that, Tabla Jamat?
[00:48:19.349 --> 00:48:23.171]  A subset of the fundamentalist movement.
[00:48:23.171 --> 00:48:24.271]  Dino Bondi movement.
[00:48:25.489 --> 00:48:37.658]  But he said that just a year into the investigation it was shut down, the State Department and the Homeland Security Office, for civil rights and civil liberties, and then he and his team were investigated and shut down a year ago.
[00:48:37.658 --> 00:48:42.382]  And it just goes over it with all the links, all the proof.
[00:48:42.382 --> 00:48:44.804]  It is incredible.
[00:48:44.804 --> 00:48:50.708]  And they were targeting the specific people that reportedly did this.
[00:48:50.708 --> 00:48:51.909]  I think the evidence is overwhelming.
[00:48:51.909 --> 00:48:53.170]  They were involved massively.
[00:48:53.170 --> 00:48:54.111]  They may have had accomplices.
[00:48:56.001 --> 00:48:56.562]  Here's another one.
[00:48:56.562 --> 00:49:02.188]  Report Obama told NSC and FBI to downplay terrorist angle of San Bernardino.
[00:49:02.188 --> 00:49:03.770]  Another Daily Caller article.
[00:49:03.770 --> 00:49:05.932]  And then they go to the admissions of that.
[00:49:05.932 --> 00:49:08.695]  And again, I don't need to have this confirmed to know it's true.
[00:49:08.695 --> 00:49:09.636]  It was obvious.
[00:49:09.636 --> 00:49:11.639]  They were saying for days it wasn't terror when it was.
[00:49:13.581 --> 00:49:18.463]  The FBI is taking heat for failing to immediately classify the San Bernardino shootings as terrorism.
[00:49:18.463 --> 00:49:22.644]  But a new report shows that FBI reluctance could have been due to external pressure from the White House.
[00:49:22.644 --> 00:49:24.805]  Then it goes through the fact that they were pressuring them.
[00:49:24.805 --> 00:49:26.486]  I'll cover more of that when we come back.
[00:49:28.700 --> 00:49:32.283]  Meanwhile though, here's a new article up on Infowars.com from TechDirt.
[00:49:32.283 --> 00:49:39.789]  Intelligence professional says NSA deserves trust, power, and it's bulk phone metadata collection back.
[00:49:39.789 --> 00:49:48.937]  Oh, you have all this illegal surveillance, it's on the ground government assessment, HUMET, that knows what this lady's up to.
[00:49:48.937 --> 00:49:50.998]  That's disregarded, ignored.
[00:49:50.998 --> 00:49:54.802]  Oh, and then I have another guy arrested for terrorism in London.
[00:49:56.192 --> 00:50:03.076]  Who was part of these PR stunts saying, I'm a Muslim, I'm labeled a terrorist, I trust you, do you trust me?
[00:50:03.076 --> 00:50:07.098]  Enough for a hug, in a nice little stunt!
[00:50:07.098 --> 00:50:11.961]  And look, he even let the women take their burqas off for the photo shoot, but they've got them hanging down around their necks.
[00:50:11.961 --> 00:50:13.301]  Isn't he nice?
[00:50:13.301 --> 00:50:16.303]  Oh, and look at this big taxpayer-funded guy, leading U.S.
[00:50:16.303 --> 00:50:22.667]  imam and professor, you can go watch the video, says, Muslims can take property of filthy Christians and Jews.
[00:50:22.667 --> 00:50:23.147]  There's video.
[00:50:25.987 --> 00:50:36.716]  He says Christians are feces, if you translate it in urine, and Muslims can take their property because we're filthy and impure.
[00:50:36.716 --> 00:50:40.439]  He's the most influential conservative cleric in American Islam.
[00:50:42.467 --> 00:50:43.948]  You can take everything.
[00:50:43.948 --> 00:50:45.849]  They're women, all of it.
[00:50:45.849 --> 00:50:48.571]  And the feminists are like, whoo, yeah!
[00:50:48.571 --> 00:50:50.452]  Man, I'm sick of these liberal men around here.
[00:50:50.452 --> 00:50:51.412]  I want it!
[00:50:51.412 --> 00:50:53.754]  I want to be in a slave dungeon!
[00:50:53.754 --> 00:50:55.315]  Whoo, yeah!
[00:50:55.315 --> 00:50:55.675]  Good!
[00:50:55.675 --> 00:50:56.876]  You will be!
[00:50:56.876 --> 00:50:57.976]  Ha, ha, ha, ha!
[00:50:57.976 --> 00:50:59.317]  Weak American men!

[00:53:29.694 --> 00:53:33.956]  With a new year coming, it's time for a new way to look at weapon storage.
[00:53:33.956 --> 00:53:37.218]  Safes can't be accessed quickly and racks are unsafe for children.
[00:53:37.218 --> 00:53:39.779]  Covert Cabinets are the next level in home defense.

[00:54:18.138 --> 00:54:27.242]  Yeah, the big news story is still that Donald Trump said until we vet who's coming in out of these countries, we've got to block immigration of Muslims.
[00:54:27.242 --> 00:54:30.463]  Something Jimmy Carter basically did in 1979.
[00:54:30.463 --> 00:54:33.384]  And you think that was the only thing happening in the world?
[00:54:33.384 --> 00:54:38.206]  It's okay, Obama's bombing all these Muslim countries, putting radicals in charge to kill everybody.
[00:54:38.206 --> 00:54:43.889]  No, no, the problem, ladies and gentlemen, is that Donald Trump
[00:54:45.549 --> 00:54:46.049]  We're good to go.
[00:55:06.192 --> 00:55:13.676]  Going into that process, we have a special report at Infowars.com, how Democrats secretly control the Republican Party delegate process.
[00:55:13.676 --> 00:55:14.777]  And they are Democrats.
[00:55:14.777 --> 00:55:18.759]  These aren't rhinos, folks, at the delegate level that stole it from Ron Paul and others.
[00:55:18.759 --> 00:55:20.500]  They are operatives.
[00:55:20.500 --> 00:55:22.822]  They know what they're doing.
[00:55:22.822 --> 00:55:29.526]  And the Tea Party is battling them right now, the good elements of it, to try to get a patriot in.
[00:55:30.495 --> 00:55:32.176]  And they've gotten Rand Paul to moderate.
[00:55:32.176 --> 00:55:33.776]  They've gotten all these other people.
[00:55:33.776 --> 00:55:37.197]  I don't care if it was Donald Trump, Rand Paul, or Ted Cruz.
[00:55:37.197 --> 00:55:46.081]  I have the Time Magazine and people calling me saying, and the Daily Beast, I guess that's Newsweek, saying, what are you endorsing Trump now?
[00:55:46.081 --> 00:55:46.961]  I'm endorsing
[00:55:48.595 --> 00:55:51.638]  Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Donald Trump.
[00:55:51.638 --> 00:55:53.800]  I think either one of those guys is great.
[00:55:53.800 --> 00:55:55.622]  I don't want to see them fighting with each other.
[00:55:55.622 --> 00:55:57.884]  The enemy is Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush.
[00:55:57.884 --> 00:56:03.289]  And I will support a third party run of Donald Trump if it's Jeb Bush or Hillary.
[00:56:03.289 --> 00:56:06.472]  I will not support either one of those globalist criminals.
[00:56:07.967 --> 00:56:09.228]  It's that simple.
[00:56:09.228 --> 00:56:15.170]  I am committed to supporting one of those three candidates, period.
[00:56:15.170 --> 00:56:17.051]  And Trump is up front.
[00:56:17.051 --> 00:56:18.591]  Trump is not a coward.
[00:56:18.591 --> 00:56:20.112]  Trump will come on this show.
[00:56:20.112 --> 00:56:24.514]  I happen to know for a fact that Trump in the last few years is getting really educated quickly.
[00:56:24.514 --> 00:56:27.895]  Like he said on the show, he said, listen, I've been totally focused on business.
[00:56:27.895 --> 00:56:29.476]  Politicians are beneath me.
[00:56:29.476 --> 00:56:30.356]  But now I'm in it.
[00:56:30.356 --> 00:56:31.257]  I'm learning fast.
[00:56:31.257 --> 00:56:31.757]  And he is.
[00:56:31.757 --> 00:56:32.977]  I'm going to stop right there.
[00:56:32.977 --> 00:56:34.378]  And that's why they're so scared of him right now.
[00:56:37.253 --> 00:56:46.997]  The media is ignoring the Donald Trump petition for 450,000 people signed at the White House saying, close our borders, don't bring in people from ISIS nations.
[00:56:46.997 --> 00:56:50.718]  That's how they operate, creating the illusion everybody wants to get rid of Trump.
[00:56:51.923 --> 00:56:55.205]  But let me tell you, Trump is only a symptom of people's anger.
[00:56:55.205 --> 00:56:58.687]  You're not getting rid of this movement to expose the globalists.
[00:56:58.687 --> 00:57:12.897]  Briefly, before we end this hour, please get the articles out that are at InfoWars.com or DailyCaller.com out that you have the White House blocking the investigation at the mosque of the husband and wife of the training camps going back two years ago.
[00:57:14.855 --> 00:57:17.556]  Well, starting three years ago, but running back a couple years.
[00:57:17.556 --> 00:57:18.377]  And they blocked it.
[00:57:18.377 --> 00:57:19.918]  They let it happen.
[00:57:19.918 --> 00:57:21.739]  We know they were under investigation.
[00:57:21.739 --> 00:57:25.581]  Another example of how they don't use this whole surveillance crew to protect us.
[00:57:25.581 --> 00:57:27.262]  They use it to enslave us.
[00:57:27.262 --> 00:57:41.310]  Now, before I end this hour, it is essential that you support the InfoWar by spreading the word and getting friends and family and neighbors and your Facebook folks, your Twitter folks to tune in to the live feeds at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:57:41.310 --> 00:57:43.331]  And it's essential you buy the products.

[00:58:38.208 --> 00:58:40.349]  Now tell friends and family to tune in.
[00:58:40.349 --> 00:58:42.151]  They don't want you listening to this show.
[00:58:42.151 --> 00:58:43.371]  Is that obvious yet?
[00:58:43.371 --> 00:58:44.712]  We're a weapon system.
[00:58:44.712 --> 00:58:44.993]  Use us!
[00:58:53.365 --> 00:59:03.091]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[00:59:03.091 --> 00:59:05.793]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[00:59:05.793 --> 00:59:09.355]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[00:59:09.355 --> 00:59:15.678]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globulous concoctions.
[00:59:15.678 --> 00:59:19.821]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychological
[00:59:19.821 --> 00:59:20.121]  I think so.
[00:59:52.623 --> 01:00:07.496]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:07.496 --> 01:00:11.559]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:00:11.559 --> 01:00:13.260]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:26.363 --> 01:00:31.525]  Sorted babies incinerated to heat UK hospitals.
[01:00:31.525 --> 01:00:35.707]  Soylent Green ladies and gentlemen is made out of people.
[01:00:35.707 --> 01:00:41.949]  But now children are literally being passed through the furnace in order to fuel hospitals in the UK.
[01:00:41.949 --> 01:00:47.732]  They're being sacrificed on the altar of efficiency and prosperity.
[01:00:47.732 --> 01:00:51.093]  What is the secret of Soylent Green?
[01:00:51.953 --> 01:00:54.474]  The powdered flesh from dead babies.
[01:00:54.474 --> 01:00:57.115]  Some people believe they can cure disease.
[01:00:57.115 --> 01:01:01.957]  Because of its enormous popularity, Soylent Green is in short supply.
[01:01:01.957 --> 01:01:04.959]  Remember, Tuesday is Soylent Green Day.
[01:01:04.959 --> 01:01:08.300]  The supply of Soylent Green has been exhausted.
[01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:10.081]  You must evacuate the area.
[01:01:12.813 --> 01:01:25.345]  The federal court ruled that the shareholders of PepsiCo, Big Bilderberg Group Company, are not allowed to know what they're using the baby parts for in the flavoring, but we already know.
[01:01:25.345 --> 01:01:27.326]  So, enjoy the flavors!
[01:01:27.326 --> 01:01:31.971]  We're going to get the real solution, which is going to be a combination of death penalties and sales taxes.
[01:01:31.971 --> 01:01:33.953]  I'm consistently pro-death.
[01:01:33.953 --> 01:01:35.814]  I'm for assisted suicide.
[01:01:35.814 --> 01:01:37.135]  I'm for regular suicide.
[01:01:37.135 --> 01:01:38.697]  I'm for whatever gets the freeway moving.
[01:01:39.037 --> 01:01:50.344]  Is spending a million dollars on that last three months of life for that patient, would it be better not to lay off those 10 teachers and to make that trade up in medical costs?
[01:01:50.344 --> 01:01:54.747]  But that's called the death panel, and you're not supposed to have that discussion.
[01:01:54.747 --> 01:02:01.011]  They told me to say that they were sorry, but that you had become unreliable.
[01:02:09.227 --> 01:02:11.848]  Is this the kind of society that you want to live in?
[01:02:11.848 --> 01:02:16.751]  Any kind of society that would do this to its children will do it to its senior citizens.
[01:02:16.751 --> 01:02:19.252]  It will do it to its dissidents.
[01:02:19.252 --> 01:02:28.617]  That kind of society will also eventually turn on its police, on its army, on its prison guards, on the quizlings and the collaborators who make that possible.
[01:02:28.617 --> 01:02:31.098]  This is nothing but a suicide cult.
[01:02:31.758 --> 01:02:33.880]  The scoops are on their way.
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:36.563]  The scoops are on their way.
[01:02:36.563 --> 01:02:39.085]  I repeat, the scoops are on their way.
[01:02:39.085 --> 01:02:42.969]  You will find out why Soylent Green means life.
[01:02:42.969 --> 01:02:46.052]  You will find out why Soylent Green means death.
[01:02:46.052 --> 01:02:47.973]  We've got to stop them!
[01:02:47.973 --> 01:02:51.477]  That is the secret of Soylent Green.
[01:02:51.477 --> 01:02:53.599]  Soylent Green is people!
[01:02:58.562 --> 01:03:02.964]  They're saying they'll be breeding cattle for food.
[01:03:02.964 --> 01:03:08.246]  You gotta tell them.
[01:03:08.246 --> 01:03:16.209]  In today's world, abortion supporters routinely attend pro-life rallies and attempt to bully activists.
[01:03:16.209 --> 01:03:24.133]  If you have a problem and need a smelly group of commie devil worshippers, maybe you can call the A-Team.
[01:03:26.483 --> 01:03:28.385]  How many did I adopt?
[01:03:28.385 --> 01:03:29.706]  I kill my kids.
[01:03:29.706 --> 01:03:35.850]  I kill my kids.
[01:03:35.850 --> 01:03:41.455]  Hey, we saw your Facebook with your communist hammer and sickle.
[01:03:41.455 --> 01:03:43.836]  That's pretty cool, man.
[01:03:43.836 --> 01:03:47.619]  Is that you on the Facebook?
[01:03:47.619 --> 01:03:49.721]  Is there a Facebook page of you with a hammer and sickle?
[01:03:50.555 --> 01:03:51.796]  I don't think so.
[01:03:51.796 --> 01:03:54.719]  How do you get your abortions paid for?
[01:03:54.719 --> 01:03:56.000]  I pay for them.
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:56.540]  Really?
[01:03:56.540 --> 01:03:59.743]  How many do you pay for them?
[01:03:59.743 --> 01:04:00.744]  Upwards of 50.
[01:04:00.744 --> 01:04:01.945]  Really?
[01:04:01.945 --> 01:04:02.405]  Oh yeah.
[01:04:12.389 --> 01:04:14.010]  You, you piece of s***!
[01:04:14.010 --> 01:04:15.831]  Bunch of misogynist motherf***ers!
[01:04:15.831 --> 01:04:18.053]  Take your male privilege somewhere else!
[01:04:18.053 --> 01:04:19.994]  Tyler, you're being aggressive.
[01:04:19.994 --> 01:04:21.555]  I'm being aggressive?
[01:04:21.555 --> 01:04:22.435]  Come on!
[01:04:22.435 --> 01:04:23.076]  Excuse us!
[01:04:23.076 --> 01:04:23.656]  Watch out!
[01:04:23.656 --> 01:04:24.957]  Watch out!
[01:04:24.957 --> 01:04:36.604]  These, that's the guys that attacked Alex Jones.
[01:04:36.604 --> 01:04:41.648]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:05:00.313 --> 01:05:01.253]  Red alert!
[01:05:01.253 --> 01:05:07.255]  Obama brings in 13,000 Muslims who support suicide bombings every year.
[01:05:07.255 --> 01:05:08.175]  Let me explain.
[01:05:08.175 --> 01:05:15.517]  This headline is based upon Pew Research polling data, which is among the most respected polling firms in the world.
[01:05:15.517 --> 01:05:25.099]  And it is an alarming statistic considering the reality of the Pew Research poll that says 13% of Muslims inside of the United States
[01:05:25.359 --> 01:05:27.421]  Now they're worried about three-year-old orphans.
[01:05:44.997 --> 01:05:50.199]  But facts are facts, regardless of the Obama administration's decision to ignore them.
[01:05:50.199 --> 01:05:56.441]  The radical mindset of the Muslim population in America is here, and it is growing.
[01:05:56.441 --> 01:05:58.662]  You can learn more right now at InfoWars.com.
[01:06:03.203 --> 01:06:12.929]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[01:06:12.929 --> 01:06:15.511]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[01:06:15.511 --> 01:06:19.193]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[01:06:19.193 --> 01:06:25.517]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globulous concoctions.
[01:06:25.517 --> 01:06:30.360]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:37.025]  Working with my team we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[01:06:37.025 --> 01:06:44.770]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[01:06:44.770 --> 01:06:52.316]  Introducing Child Ease with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.

[01:08:13.786 --> 01:08:14.907]  Big Brother.
[01:08:14.907 --> 01:08:16.707]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:16.707 --> 01:08:18.648]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:18.648 --> 01:08:20.309]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:08:20.309 --> 01:08:21.949]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:21.949 --> 01:08:27.772]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:08:27.772 --> 01:08:33.014]  If you're a TV viewer, you can see what I'm showing right now on screen.
[01:08:33.014 --> 01:08:36.255]  If you're a radio listener, go to InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:08:36.255 --> 01:08:37.856]  But I'll let you in on it.
[01:08:37.856 --> 01:08:42.458]  I just tweeted during the break, President Chuck Norris
[01:08:43.885 --> 01:08:48.588]  2016, tune in live to find out.
[01:08:48.588 --> 01:08:54.593]  And no, I'm not going to push the idea that Chuck Norris is running for president in 2016, though I wish he would.
[01:08:54.593 --> 01:09:00.137]  His son Mike Norris, accomplished filmmaker in his own right, is going to be joining us coming up in the next hour.
[01:09:01.516 --> 01:09:15.133]  Because he has produced a film with a pretty good budget that his dad and others warned him would have Hollywood come after him and try to blackball him, just like they tried to do to Chuck Norris, who you see there on screen with his son, Mike Norris.
[01:09:15.133 --> 01:09:16.514]  And that has certainly happened.
[01:09:16.514 --> 01:09:19.799]  They are really coming after this film.
[01:09:21.058 --> 01:09:26.124]  But many of these films he's produced do also end up airing, in fact all of them, on cable to tens of millions.
[01:09:26.124 --> 01:09:30.568]  So this is going to be undoubtedly a very successful film.
[01:09:30.568 --> 01:09:32.030]  Amerageddon.
[01:09:32.030 --> 01:09:41.740]  We'll tell you about its release in theaters and television, a Blu-ray DVD, coming up when he joins us in the third hour today.
[01:09:42.933 --> 01:09:53.906]  And it's a bold move that they're engaged in here, folks, to really expose the whole Agenda 21 agenda, EMP agenda, how globalists are in our governments.
[01:09:53.906 --> 01:10:01.154]  One of the top actors they got, he's got a bunch of big actors in it, plays basically a Maury Strong character who just died last week.
[01:10:01.154 --> 01:10:02.235]  Yours truly is in the film.
[01:10:03.816 --> 01:10:05.656]  I've lost another 20 pounds since I was in the film.
[01:10:05.656 --> 01:10:06.097]  I wish.
[01:10:06.097 --> 01:10:07.037]  I'm still not that skinny.
[01:10:07.037 --> 01:10:09.417]  I tell you, Mike Norris looks great.
[01:10:09.417 --> 01:10:10.357]  He's almost getting too skinny.
[01:10:10.357 --> 01:10:12.258]  I tell you, that guy is in great shape.
[01:10:12.258 --> 01:10:18.319]  So he's going to be in studio with us talking about all things Planet Norris.
[01:10:18.319 --> 01:10:22.020]  Because there's only one thing that would trump Donald Trump running for president.
[01:10:22.020 --> 01:10:29.261]  And I'm telling you, America would love to have President Chuck Norris.
[01:10:29.261 --> 01:10:30.362]  And you know what?
[01:10:30.362 --> 01:10:31.662]  I was talking to Mike about that.
[01:10:34.008 --> 01:10:36.110]  There might have been some talk about it.
[01:10:36.110 --> 01:10:44.038]  We might even have more for you in the next hour on the idea of President Chuck Norris 2016.
[01:10:44.038 --> 01:10:45.379]  Now here's the question.
[01:10:45.379 --> 01:10:47.842]  Would you have President Trump Vice President Norris?
[01:10:47.842 --> 01:10:52.767]  Or would you have President Norris Vice President Trump?
[01:10:52.767 --> 01:10:57.672]  Now Chuck Norris is a very humble person, but I don't know if America would allow him
[01:10:58.991 --> 01:11:00.492]  To be vice president.
[01:11:00.492 --> 01:11:02.853]  Maybe he could be a dual president.
[01:11:02.853 --> 01:11:09.056]  I guess that is kind of what a vice president is, but I'm just having some fun with this.
[01:11:09.056 --> 01:11:11.957]  It's kind of gallows humor because everything is unfolding.
[01:11:11.957 --> 01:11:15.319]  World government, forced inoculations, the FBI coming out.
[01:11:15.319 --> 01:11:19.381]  Yeah, we were ordered not to stop the terrorist that attacked in San Bernardino last week.
[01:11:19.381 --> 01:11:21.282]  So it is a White House false flag.
[01:11:21.282 --> 01:11:25.544]  They brought him in, they let her have fake visa info, let her use fake addresses.
[01:11:26.829 --> 01:11:27.670]  And let her attack.
[01:11:27.670 --> 01:11:29.171]  I covered that in the last hour.
[01:11:29.171 --> 01:11:30.953]  We now have this leading imam and U.S.
[01:11:30.953 --> 01:11:37.558]  professor on the taxpayer dole, I guess, saying Muslims can take property of filthy Christians and Jews.
[01:11:37.558 --> 01:11:39.179]  And again, I'm not Islamophobic.
[01:11:39.179 --> 01:11:40.921]  I don't dislike Muslims in general.
[01:11:40.921 --> 01:11:43.063]  Everybody knows I was against all these wars.
[01:11:43.063 --> 01:11:53.211]  But now I'm not for bringing in all these radicals and just letting them run around saying you will be under Sharia law and your mother and your daughters will wear burqas on their heads and you will submit.
[01:11:54.844 --> 01:11:56.646]  I mean, that's what this comes down to.
[01:11:56.646 --> 01:12:08.696]  Now, we're going to have Alex Newman with us until about 45 after, and then I'll shift gears into the Second Amendment attack, the jobless numbers, and a bunch of other really important stories that we haven't gotten to yet.
[01:12:08.696 --> 01:12:12.039]  But next hour, the premiere of the trailer.
[01:12:12.039 --> 01:12:14.321]  First sneak peek of Amerageddon.
[01:12:15.356 --> 01:12:18.538]  I forget how many millions the budget was, but we had a really good budget.
[01:12:18.538 --> 01:12:25.464]  I mean, I showed up to the movies, all these giant trucks and cranes, and I was like, this is a bigger production than when I was in Waking Life and Scanner Darkly.
[01:12:25.464 --> 01:12:30.408]  They had, like, Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder and Woody Harrelson, and who's the guy that plays Iron Man?
[01:12:32.665 --> 01:12:33.726]  Robert Downey Jr.
[01:12:33.726 --> 01:12:38.468]  Everybody was super cool on the set of that, but Robert Downey Jr., he really thought he was God.
[01:12:38.468 --> 01:12:39.768]  But I guess he's the highest-paid actor.
[01:12:39.768 --> 01:12:44.030]  I guess he's like John Lennon, you know, we're bigger than Jesus until you find out you're not.
[01:12:44.030 --> 01:12:49.553]  Of course, John Lennon didn't really mean that when he said it was tongue-in-cheek, but still, it's not a lucky statement.
[01:12:49.553 --> 01:12:51.013]  It's like the Titanic.
[01:12:51.013 --> 01:12:56.696]  Not even God can sink this ship, and then you find out real fast what happens on your maiden voyage.
[01:12:57.941 --> 01:13:22.768]  But shifting gears to a focus we've been looking at for a month really intensely but the last several weeks as it kicked off and now is getting ready to close early next week and that is the situation with the biggest grouping of world leaders in history for the UN Summit on Climate Change that's really a carbon tax global government global court initiative the newamerican.com is the magazine
[01:13:24.105 --> 01:13:37.773]  of the John Birch Society, crack reporters out there taking actions, and Alex Newman is an international journalist, educator, author, and consultant, and he writes for WorldNet Daily, and the New American Magazine, and of course is a frequent guest here.
[01:13:37.773 --> 01:13:51.382]  I'm not going to go over his whole bio, his TV programs, and the conferences, and the rest of it, but he joins us as a crack investigative journalist from the ground in socialist-occupied, globalist command base, UN Cesspool, Paris.
[01:13:51.382 --> 01:13:53.203]  Nothing against the beautiful city of Paris, but it is a
[01:13:54.449 --> 01:13:58.892]  You've been there now for I guess a large portion of this conference.
[01:13:58.892 --> 01:14:00.393]  What can you report to us, Alex Newman?
[01:14:12.864 --> 01:14:15.265]  Well, I think you gave a really good description right at the start.
[01:14:15.265 --> 01:14:17.866]  I mean, this is not a conference about the climate.
[01:14:17.866 --> 01:14:23.028]  Every once in a while they'll talk about global warming or climate, but they're not really interested in the science for the climate.
[01:14:23.028 --> 01:14:24.489]  That's a cover.
[01:14:24.489 --> 01:14:25.490]  It is, exactly.
[01:14:25.490 --> 01:14:28.591]  And what they're really discussing here is international wealth redistribution.
[01:14:29.011 --> 01:14:33.192]  Setting up the nucleus of the global government to take carbon taxes.
[01:14:33.192 --> 01:14:41.354]  And, you know, essentially every leftist, globalist, socialist, ridiculous idea has found its way into this conference under one geyser or another.
[01:14:41.354 --> 01:14:50.136]  So, you know, you have the Save the Forest people with the carbon tax people, and all of them working together to essentially build up the nucleus of the global government.
[01:14:50.136 --> 01:14:54.498]  And the latest draft treaty that they've released, the last one I have came from last night.
[01:14:54.498 --> 01:14:55.878]  They're supposedly working on the next one.
[01:14:56.919 --> 01:15:03.886]  Essentially, it's committing the world to reduce and eventually eliminate by 2050 the use of fossil fuels.
[01:15:03.886 --> 01:15:10.073]  So really, this is going to be condemning billions of people to perpetual poverty and probably early death.
[01:15:10.073 --> 01:15:15.919]  So, you know, the consequences of this summit are going to be huge and they're going to be well beyond just the loss of freedom.
[01:15:15.919 --> 01:15:18.682]  We're talking about people's lives on the line here.
[01:15:20.262 --> 01:15:31.204]  It's so sickening to watch this group of collectivists in jumbo jets with all the hookers and the thousand-dollar-a-plate food for two weeks lecturing everyone on how they can't have air conditioning or automobiles.
[01:15:31.204 --> 01:15:32.264]  I mean, they actually do that.
[01:15:32.264 --> 01:15:34.345]  I'm not just saying that.
[01:15:34.345 --> 01:15:35.685]  Everyone knows that.
[01:15:35.685 --> 01:15:42.786]  And then they cast themselves as the heroes in their own taxpayer-funded production.
[01:15:42.786 --> 01:15:47.207]  I mean, this is so ridiculously over-the-top and so villainous
[01:15:47.927 --> 01:15:50.194]  Mr. Newman, but they seem to get away with it.
[01:15:51.892 --> 01:15:52.332]  Well, they do.
[01:15:52.332 --> 01:16:09.347]  I'm actually sitting in the press pool right now, and it shouldn't be called the press pool, it should be called the cheerleading pool, because you have here a bunch of climate cultists who believe, of course, the global warming scam, and they also believe that these governments, these dictatorships that are here in force, have the power to, you know, control the climate, right?
[01:16:09.347 --> 01:16:17.755]  They think that, at least the press pool thinks that if we slash our fossil fuel use, deindustrialize our society, transfer all our wealth to third world dictators,
[01:16:18.055 --> 01:16:23.642]  Suddenly the climate is going to obey us and the temperature is not going to increase above 1.5 degrees.
[01:16:23.642 --> 01:16:36.077]  So, you know, if you understand the science, if you've been talking to the scientists, if you've looked at the IPCC information, it's clear that this is all a gigantic charade to con us out of our money and out of our freedom and out of our national sovereignty.
[01:16:36.357 --> 01:16:45.683]  But the reason people aren't educated by and large around the world, Americans are much better at this than the rest of the world, but it's because of the people upstairs and the people down here in the press pool.
[01:16:45.683 --> 01:16:51.126]  It's pathetic, it's a disgrace, and I'm just ashamed to call myself a journalist being in this area.
[01:16:52.407 --> 01:16:52.808]  We're good to go.
[01:17:08.166 --> 01:17:17.489]  Well, France doesn't produce anything anymore, and their governing class, as you know, is going to get a large slice of third world carbon tax that's meant to absolutely cripple them.
[01:17:17.489 --> 01:17:19.669]  So this is the new colonialism.
[01:17:19.669 --> 01:17:24.931]  And if you watch Sony, PlayStation, or these other video game ads, you get what's happening.
[01:17:24.931 --> 01:17:30.212]  It's all, be a hero, command forces, lead assault troops, be a man, be a leader.
[01:17:30.512 --> 01:17:34.816]  Don't really do that in the real world, in business or life, or be a great dad, take care of your kids.
[01:17:34.816 --> 01:17:37.117]  Don't be a firefighter, police officer, anything like that.
[01:17:37.117 --> 01:17:38.499]  Don't be a hard-working farmer.
[01:17:38.499 --> 01:17:42.042]  Don't be an engineer, or a writer, or a teacher.
[01:17:42.042 --> 01:17:42.602]  No!
[01:17:42.602 --> 01:17:44.223]  You're going to be a hero in this fantasy land.
[01:17:44.223 --> 01:17:47.766]  Well, they've billed it as, save the Earth from global freezing.
[01:17:47.766 --> 01:17:49.368]  Save the Earth from global warming.
[01:17:49.368 --> 01:17:51.429]  Save the Earth from global climate change.
[01:17:51.429 --> 01:17:53.171]  Be a climate warrior.
[01:17:53.171 --> 01:17:53.991]  Help take over.
[01:17:53.991 --> 01:17:54.832]  Help govern.
[01:17:54.832 --> 01:17:58.275]  Live off other people's tax money, and feel good about yourself.
[01:17:58.275 --> 01:17:59.156]  And so, that's what it is.
[01:17:59.716 --> 01:18:00.877]  Oh, we're heroes!
[01:18:00.877 --> 01:18:03.300]  Oh, we're so great!
[01:18:03.300 --> 01:18:14.090]  And it's a giant, flaming, conscious fraud invented by Enron 20 years ago and Al Gore on record to literally take a cut of all human activity on Earth.
[01:18:14.090 --> 01:18:16.193]  It couldn't get more ridiculous.
[01:18:17.264 --> 01:18:18.025]  That's exactly right.
[01:18:18.025 --> 01:18:20.587]  They're talking about putting a price on carbon dioxide.
[01:18:20.587 --> 01:18:25.871]  You know, all the scientists that we've talked to since we arrived in Paris have explained that carbon dioxide is the gas of life.
[01:18:25.871 --> 01:18:27.152]  This is the stuff we exhale.
[01:18:27.152 --> 01:18:28.794]  This is what plants need to breathe.
[01:18:28.794 --> 01:18:30.675]  And the Earth is starved for carbon dioxide.
[01:18:30.675 --> 01:18:42.445]  So you have this giant charade here where we're pretending that the gas of life is pollution in need of regulation, in need of taxation, so that we can pay carbon taxes to Al Gore, to Goldman Sachs, to the United Nations.
[01:18:42.785 --> 01:18:50.187]  All the while having what little remains of our wealth and what little remains of our free market and what little remains of our liberty stripped from us to deal with the hoax.
[01:18:50.187 --> 01:18:53.187]  And you can tell it's a very well-orchestrated charade here.
[01:18:53.187 --> 01:19:00.809]  You know, they have the rent-a-mobs outside, these taxpayer-funded NGOs demanding, climate justice, climate justice!
[01:19:00.809 --> 01:19:06.990]  And the negotiators walk past and they say, oh yes, the world citizens really want climate justice, we better get to work.
[01:19:06.990 --> 01:19:11.151]  And so they're in there right now, haggling about whether we're going to keep temperature increases.
[01:19:11.451 --> 01:19:13.433]  Two legs good, two legs bad.
[01:19:13.433 --> 01:19:16.696]  Jumbo jets bad, unless they're ours.
[01:19:16.696 --> 01:19:18.458]  We're at a private jet airport.
[01:19:18.458 --> 01:19:20.500]  This conference is taking place at Le Bourget.
[01:19:20.500 --> 01:19:27.126]  This is an airport for private jets, so that the presidents and the dictators and the celebrities and the Al-Gors can come here in their private jets.
[01:19:27.126 --> 01:19:29.468]  And then they say, well, we bought carbon offsets.
[01:19:31.109 --> 01:19:32.971]  They don't have Hollywood trailers anymore.
[01:19:32.971 --> 01:19:35.412]  The jets are for the sex parties, the drugs.
[01:19:35.412 --> 01:19:40.776]  Under international law, they can keep them all on board, never clear customs, even bring in some sex slaves.
[01:19:40.776 --> 01:19:41.556]  And I'm not joking.
[01:19:41.556 --> 01:19:46.199]  I bet Monday some of these UN delegates have got people chained up on board those aircraft.
[01:19:46.199 --> 01:19:47.500]  They're always getting caught doing it.
[01:19:47.500 --> 01:19:52.463]  I mean, you cannot make up the magnitude of the corruption, the insolence.
[01:19:52.463 --> 01:19:53.624]  Look at this report.
[01:19:53.624 --> 01:19:56.866]  World War will run on a breathable air unless we cut carbon.
[01:19:56.866 --> 01:19:57.426]  See?

[01:22:02.546 --> 01:22:12.714]  At ID Stronghold, we still find that a huge percentage of people do not yet have an RFID blocking wallet or purse to protect them from the new and growing threat of electronic pickpocketing.
[01:22:12.714 --> 01:22:26.046]  That's right, even though 40% of all new chipped payment cards shipped in 2014 contain a wireless interface called RFID that allows the account information to be skimmed by a thief passing near your cards, most people are still unprotected.

[01:24:16.315 --> 01:24:36.040]  I start ranting and raving pretty much just as second nature like breathing because I think about the hundreds, hundreds, they're reporting over 300 large wide-body jets just for the world leaders and their staff and then hundreds of other private guests
[01:24:37.898 --> 01:24:53.181]  For Alec Baldwin and Leonardo DiCaprio and all these people who live like emperors to lecture us on how we're evil and need to be arrested because we don't want carbon taxes.
[01:24:53.181 --> 01:25:01.583]  And then I have this article, Report, and this is from Yahoo, and it's TakePart.com, just some PR firm.
[01:25:03.044 --> 01:25:04.405]  Leftist group.
[01:25:04.405 --> 01:25:04.905]  Report!
[01:25:04.905 --> 01:25:08.006]  The world will run out of breathable air unless carbon is cut.
[01:25:08.006 --> 01:25:11.088]  Now, this is an inversion of reality.
[01:25:11.088 --> 01:25:14.429]  It is on record that the carbon cycle is four things.
[01:25:14.429 --> 01:25:17.350]  Sunlight.
[01:25:17.350 --> 01:25:17.751]  Sunlight.
[01:25:17.751 --> 01:25:19.071]  Okay?
[01:25:19.071 --> 01:25:20.432]  Water.
[01:25:20.432 --> 01:25:22.233]  Carbon dioxide and oxygen.
[01:25:22.233 --> 01:25:27.555]  If you don't have water, sunlight, carbon dioxide and oxygen, the carbon cycle ends.
[01:25:29.107 --> 01:25:34.068]  They admit that the Earth is losing a lot of its atmosphere, has less atmosphere than it had millions of years ago.
[01:25:34.068 --> 01:25:40.610]  Mars, they've now confirmed, has water all over it, did have oceans on it, lost most of its atmosphere.
[01:25:40.610 --> 01:25:50.692]  Plants and animals in symbiotic relationship in the carbon cycle with water and sunlight and carbon dioxide and oxygen create more carbon dioxide and oxygen that are trace gases.
[01:25:52.463 --> 01:25:58.526]  It is known that the Earth has had carbon dioxide at hundreds of times its levels, and oxygen was much higher as well.
[01:25:58.526 --> 01:26:01.748]  We are in a crisis, actually.
[01:26:01.748 --> 01:26:02.628]  I can't believe it.
[01:26:02.628 --> 01:26:04.009]  And of course, that's mainline science.
[01:26:04.009 --> 01:26:04.890]  You can go discover that.
[01:26:04.890 --> 01:26:07.191]  That's not debated.
[01:26:07.191 --> 01:26:11.273]  That they believe desertification and things are being accelerated because of lower carbon dioxide levels.
[01:26:13.365 --> 01:26:18.230]  And then they put out reports saying we've got to cut carbon or the Earth's going to die, there'll be no air.
[01:26:18.230 --> 01:26:27.798]  When they're the ones, it's almost God had a plan, like, there's all this fossil fuel, it's dirty, it's got problems, but we burn it right at the key time and it beefs up our atmosphere a little bit?
[01:26:27.798 --> 01:26:36.226]  I mean, we should really have big terraforming facilities like aliens, you know, where they've got them pumping CO2 into the atmosphere to terraform the planet.
[01:26:36.226 --> 01:26:38.028]  LV-246 or whatever it's called in the movie.
[01:26:40.185 --> 01:26:40.806]  I'm not kidding.
[01:26:40.806 --> 01:26:43.128]  We should actually not be pumping it back into the ground.
[01:26:43.128 --> 01:26:45.851]  We should be pumping it up.
[01:26:45.851 --> 01:26:47.293]  They're talking about cutting down trees.
[01:26:47.293 --> 01:26:50.736]  I'm going to just keep moving to the end of the hour because I'm cutting into his time and I want to hear him report here.
[01:26:50.736 --> 01:26:53.599]  It's just that, do you understand the magnitude of this, folks?
[01:26:53.599 --> 01:26:54.060]  Report.
[01:26:54.060 --> 01:26:56.583]  The world will run out of breathable air unless carbon is cut.
[01:26:58.140 --> 01:27:02.183]  Marine plants such as photoplankton are estimated to produce more than half the Earth's atmospheric oxygen.
[01:27:02.183 --> 01:27:04.624]  According to the National Oceanic Atmosphere Administration.
[01:27:04.624 --> 01:27:11.129]  And it just goes into all this mumbo-jumbo garbage and saying if it rises six degrees it'll hurt the plankton and then we won't have the oxygen.
[01:27:11.129 --> 01:27:13.350]  More CO2 makes them produce more oxygen.
[01:27:13.350 --> 01:27:14.951]  It's just loads of bull.
[01:27:14.951 --> 01:27:19.834]  I've had all the top experts on, on photoplankton and astrophysics and I'm ranting.
[01:27:19.834 --> 01:27:20.655]  Three minutes to break.
[01:27:20.655 --> 01:27:26.799]  What else is happening, Alex Newman, at the conference where they're going to save us from the carbon cycle that is life itself?
[01:27:28.203 --> 01:27:30.304]  You made some excellent points right there, Alex.
[01:27:30.304 --> 01:27:35.487]  On Monday, we went to the Counter-COP21 Conference put on by the Heartland Institute.
[01:27:35.487 --> 01:27:36.668]  Lots of top experts.
[01:27:36.668 --> 01:27:39.990]  I mean, the credentials of these guys are just off the charts.
[01:27:39.990 --> 01:27:43.231]  And all of them explained carbon dioxide is wonderful for the planet.
[01:27:43.231 --> 01:27:44.992]  The Earth is starved for carbon dioxide.
[01:27:44.992 --> 01:27:48.714]  The global warming hoax needs to be exposed because millions of people are going to die.
[01:27:48.714 --> 01:27:50.936]  The next day, we went to the French Counter-COP21 Summit.
[01:27:51.756 --> 01:27:58.644]  Same thing, European experts, the head of the European Chemical Society, professors from top universities explaining exactly the same thing.
[01:27:58.644 --> 01:28:01.026]  Carbon dioxide is wonderful for the planet.
[01:28:01.026 --> 01:28:07.734]  It is the gas of life and these fraudsters here at the United Nations are saying it's pollution and we need to regulate it.
[01:28:07.734 --> 01:28:10.497]  One of the things that went on here that I do want to tell the listeners about
[01:28:11.157 --> 01:28:17.341]  My colleague and I were actually intimidated by the communist Chinese dictatorship and so that made us really uncomfortable.
[01:28:17.341 --> 01:28:19.042]  We just put an article out about it.
[01:28:19.042 --> 01:28:21.864]  Yesterday we went over to their booth and asked them for an interview.
[01:28:21.864 --> 01:28:32.350]  Instead of giving us an interview, they tracked us back to the media center and I turned around from my desk and the same guy we had talked to is sitting there snapping pictures of my colleague and I. So we're gonna make a big deal out of this.
[01:28:32.350 --> 01:28:37.033]  Communist China does this all the time, haranguing dissidents, spying on dissidents.
[01:28:37.533 --> 01:28:38.674]  And it's unacceptable.
[01:28:38.674 --> 01:28:40.416]  The UN says there's nothing they can do about it.
[01:28:40.416 --> 01:28:42.517]  The French police say there's nothing they can do about it.
[01:28:42.517 --> 01:28:43.998]  Well, at least people need to know about it.
[01:28:43.998 --> 01:28:48.022]  These are the maniacs that the UN is talking about handing over the keys.
[01:28:48.022 --> 01:28:50.764]  I bet there's nothing they can do about it if Chuck Norris kicks them in the nose.
[01:28:51.813 --> 01:29:02.799]  Right, so that would be brilliant, but I mean the French police say no, that's UN territory, we're powerless, we'll take your, I mean I filed a report with them, but they can't do anything, they can't even come in here, they can't even wear their police uniforms here.
[01:29:02.799 --> 01:29:06.501]  Then the UN police say no, they're with the government, sorry, there's nothing we can do, we work for the government.
[01:29:06.501 --> 01:29:11.304]  That's what I was saying earlier, diplomatic immunity zone for them to snort all the cocaine they want.
[01:29:12.335 --> 01:29:12.855]  That's right.
[01:29:12.855 --> 01:29:15.457]  I mean, the diplomatic immunity stuff has got to go.
[01:29:15.457 --> 01:29:19.040]  So many crimes are being perpetrated all over the world, including in the United States.
[01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:21.602]  We have spies, drug dealers... Stay there!
[01:29:21.602 --> 01:29:30.869]  I'm going to come back and for like 10 minutes give you the floor to really roll with your report, Alex Newman, and what you went through with the Communist Chinese, the photos you have up at the New American Magazine.
[01:29:31.590 --> 01:29:33.091]  We just showed that to TV viewers.
[01:29:33.091 --> 01:29:36.214]  We're going to post your article at InfoWars.com as well.
[01:29:36.214 --> 01:29:37.795]  TheNewAmerican.com.
[01:29:37.795 --> 01:29:39.217]  See why I get so upset?
[01:29:39.217 --> 01:29:40.177]  It just gets crazier.
[01:29:40.177 --> 01:29:42.499]  Communist Chinese harassing people.
[01:29:42.499 --> 01:29:43.800]  Diplomatic immunity.
[01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:45.382]  Taxpayer paid for.
[01:29:45.382 --> 01:29:49.485]  I mean, folks, when are we going to get angry and say no?
[01:29:49.485 --> 01:29:50.886]  We're on the march.
[01:29:50.886 --> 01:29:53.408]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.408 --> 01:29:56.091]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.296 --> 01:30:05.017]  Anti-gunners are planning a very pungent protest this weekend in Austin, Texas.
[01:30:05.017 --> 01:30:13.700]  In response to pro-CCL activists staging a mock mass shooting, counter-demonstrators will resort to waving dildos and mass farting.
[01:30:13.700 --> 01:30:18.381]  Yes, this is the self-defense equivalent of peeing yourself to stop a rape.
[01:30:18.381 --> 01:30:26.264]  With cardboard guns and fake blood, Come and Take It Texas and DontComply.com are pitching a life and liberty event to end gun-free zones.
[01:30:26.724 --> 01:30:34.150]  The active shooter drill will take place near the University of Texas this Saturday, but this time, the shooter picks the wrong crowd.
[01:30:34.150 --> 01:30:45.118]  The planned event comes at a particularly tense time in the nation's gun debate, and Texas colleges and universities are debating how to implement the state's new campus carry law that will start next fall.
[01:30:45.118 --> 01:30:52.624]  But gun control advocates say this event is offensive, and so they're staging a mass farting and dildo waving counter-protest.
[01:30:54.040 --> 01:30:55.748]  You fart in your gender direction!
[01:30:55.748 --> 01:30:58.361]  Read more about this event at InfoWars.com
[01:30:59.847 --> 01:31:03.349]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:31:03.349 --> 01:31:11.613]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:31:11.613 --> 01:31:17.016]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[01:31:17.016 --> 01:31:19.557]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[01:31:19.557 --> 01:31:21.658]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[01:31:29.716 --> 01:31:30.836]  Brain Force is here.
[01:31:30.836 --> 01:31:33.037]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[01:31:33.037 --> 01:31:38.039]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of Brain Force.
[01:31:38.039 --> 01:31:41.321]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[01:31:41.321 --> 01:31:44.802]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[01:31:44.802 --> 01:31:46.503]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[01:31:46.783 --> 01:31:47.704]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[01:31:47.704 --> 01:31:48.885]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[01:31:48.885 --> 01:31:50.888]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[01:31:50.888 --> 01:31:59.477]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:31:59.477 --> 01:32:03.902]  We have been fighting this war tirelessly with you at our side, day in and day out.
[01:32:04.122 --> 01:32:07.803]  Exposing the ludicrous lies and criminal operations of the globalists.
[01:32:07.803 --> 01:32:10.124]  And we're starting to see big effects.
[01:32:10.124 --> 01:32:12.024]  And the word is getting out.
[01:32:12.024 --> 01:32:14.085]  The globalists want to make us dependent.
[01:32:14.085 --> 01:32:17.826]  And as Napoleon famously said, an army marches on its stomach.
[01:32:17.826 --> 01:32:21.647]  Ammunition, food and supplies form the backbone of any offensive.
[01:32:21.647 --> 01:32:23.308]  Including the Info War.
[01:32:23.308 --> 01:32:26.529]  And our enemies admit they're losing the Info War.
[01:32:26.529 --> 01:32:28.349]  We are in an information war.
[01:32:28.349 --> 01:32:30.030]  And we are losing that war.
[01:32:30.270 --> 01:32:36.773]  With this in mind, we have held strong to our principles and the decision to refuse any money from globalists or government.
[01:32:36.773 --> 01:32:43.776]  We are funding our crusade against tyranny the old-fashioned way with pure free-market, free-will capitalism.
[01:32:43.776 --> 01:32:53.500]  Visit Infowarsstore.com today or call 888-253-3139 and take advantage of free shipping right through December 18th and get your order before Christmas.
[01:32:53.500 --> 01:32:58.702]  May God bless you and your family and keep us strong as we forge ahead in this battle for humanity.
[01:33:00.839 --> 01:33:10.821]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:10.821 --> 01:33:15.462]  Is Chuck Norris gonna run for president in 2016?
[01:33:15.462 --> 01:33:17.762]  Am I pulling your leg?
[01:33:17.762 --> 01:33:22.303]  Was I pulling your leg last week when I told you Donald Trump was coming on?
[01:33:22.303 --> 01:33:25.744]  Could we draft Chuck Norris to run in 2016?
[01:33:28.297 --> 01:33:30.298]  A flying sidekick takes out Hillary.
[01:33:30.298 --> 01:33:34.319]  A flying sidekick takes out Jeb Bush.
[01:33:34.319 --> 01:33:42.041]  Flying sidekick knocks the orange possum off of the head of Donald Trump.
[01:33:42.041 --> 01:33:46.943]  By the way, Donald Trump makes fun of his hair and the fact that he's orange, just like I make fun of my big pumpkin head.
[01:33:46.943 --> 01:33:53.545]  So it's all done in friendliness.
[01:33:53.545 --> 01:33:55.886]  We're going to premiere the trailer for the first time ever.
[01:33:55.886 --> 01:33:56.546]  Amerageddon.
[01:33:57.811 --> 01:34:08.696]  At the start of the next hour, and then we will have Mike Norris, the director, in studio with us for the balance of the hour.
[01:34:08.696 --> 01:34:16.580]  Amerigeddon is a dire warning wake-up call of what could be our future when a globalist terrorist organization along with the United Nations disables the U.S.
[01:34:16.580 --> 01:34:19.001]  power grid and institutes martial law.
[01:34:19.001 --> 01:34:25.784]  It will take a dedicated family of patriots armed with strong survival skills and the remains of the Second Amendment to save America and reclaim its freedom.
[01:34:27.284 --> 01:34:28.945]  This is the movie they do not want you to see.
[01:34:28.945 --> 01:34:29.885]  Banned from Hollywood.
[01:34:29.885 --> 01:34:31.046]  It actually happened.
[01:34:31.046 --> 01:34:34.087]  Comes out in theaters March 2nd in Texas only at first.
[01:34:34.087 --> 01:34:35.288]  Texas Independence Day.
[01:34:35.288 --> 01:34:37.069]  Then a wider release later.
[01:34:37.069 --> 01:34:39.090]  Based on a true story that hasn't happened yet.
[01:34:39.090 --> 01:34:41.131]  Action packed with multiple layers.
[01:34:41.131 --> 01:34:43.372]  Political and personal.
[01:34:43.372 --> 01:34:46.914]  And there's some inside baseball to all this as a way to serialize it.
[01:34:46.914 --> 01:34:49.695]  And to a general audience on television.
[01:34:49.695 --> 01:34:51.176]  Wake people up to what's happening.
[01:34:52.443 --> 01:34:59.489]  Almost like Red Dawn 2.0 or America with a K with Kris Kristofferson 2.0.
[01:34:59.489 --> 01:35:00.610]  Very, very important film.
[01:35:00.610 --> 01:35:03.092]  And yes, I'm in it.
[01:35:03.092 --> 01:35:04.793]  But that's not the reason it's important.
[01:35:04.793 --> 01:35:09.798]  It's the storyline of the film that will reach out to a larger audience.
[01:35:09.798 --> 01:35:12.200]  So that is coming up.
[01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:14.682]  Most of the brainwashing we see is in Hollywood.
[01:35:14.682 --> 01:35:16.323]  It's in entertainment television.
[01:35:16.323 --> 01:35:19.586]  We are beating the globalist when it comes to news with our information.
[01:35:20.828 --> 01:35:24.790]  But most of the real war is going on in the entertainment zone.
[01:35:24.790 --> 01:35:27.992]  That's why Amerageddon is so important.
[01:35:27.992 --> 01:35:29.993]  AmerageddonTheMovie.com.
[01:35:29.993 --> 01:35:31.834]  AmerageddonTheMovie.com.
[01:35:31.834 --> 01:35:37.677]  We're going to tweet that out with the trailer that just went live at InfoWars.com.
[01:35:37.677 --> 01:35:43.961]  We are going to tweet that out at Real Alex Jones and we're going to be posting it to Facebook.
[01:35:43.961 --> 01:35:45.302]  Amerageddon Exclusive Release.
[01:35:45.302 --> 01:35:46.942]  Powerful Film Exposes Globalist.
[01:35:46.942 --> 01:35:47.783]  Takeover Plan.
[01:35:47.783 --> 01:35:49.184]  Director, son of Chuck Norris.
[01:35:50.307 --> 01:35:54.929]  reveals trailer on film no one wants you to see.
[01:35:54.929 --> 01:35:56.590]  So that is coming up.
[01:35:56.590 --> 01:36:01.071]  We'll release the film today that no one in the establishment wants you to see.
[01:36:01.071 --> 01:36:04.613]  So that is coming up.
[01:36:04.613 --> 01:36:07.334]  Alex Newman will be with us for the balance of the hour.
[01:36:07.334 --> 01:36:19.039]  Briefly here, we have come out with a private labeled super high quality solar panel system that comes with the battery system and the control system with all the adapters that is
[01:36:20.253 --> 01:36:24.177]  About 40% less than the leading competitor.
[01:36:24.177 --> 01:36:33.065]  We have sold out of the other units that are for jumping your car and the rest of it that are way, way, way, way under their competitors as well.
[01:36:33.065 --> 01:36:37.128]  This is really a high quality unit and we only have gotten 100 of these.
[01:36:39.198 --> 01:36:41.321]  And so it will sell out the next few weeks or so.
[01:36:41.321 --> 01:36:44.284]  Plus, we don't have 100 because a couple people in the office want one.
[01:36:44.284 --> 01:36:45.766]  I'm going to get a couple of them.
[01:36:45.766 --> 01:36:49.510]  So let's just say we got about 60 of these left right now currently.
[01:36:49.510 --> 01:36:51.653]  So it could sell out in days at the current rates.
[01:36:51.653 --> 01:36:54.115]  And your purchase of this product
[01:36:55.256 --> 01:36:56.957]  Makes what we do here possible.
[01:36:56.957 --> 01:37:00.860]  The InfoWars Solar Base Station Power Supply.
[01:37:00.860 --> 01:37:05.783]  Separately, we've got free shipping until December 18th, when you're guaranteed to get your package before Christmas.
[01:37:05.783 --> 01:37:08.504]  If you order then, and we've got a bunch of specials.
[01:37:08.504 --> 01:37:16.830]  The Essentials Pack, Survival Shield X2, Super Male or Female Vitality, and Silver Bullet, Colloidal Silver, 33% off, on top of free shipping.
[01:37:16.830 --> 01:37:20.372]  The Deep Cleanse Pack, Deep Cleanse, Living Defense, Oxy Powder, 28% off.
[01:37:22.409 --> 01:37:30.493]  Winter Sun, vitamin D, the truly absorbable type, be taken under the tongue, sublingual, 15% off, plus the free shipping.
[01:37:30.493 --> 01:37:38.536]  Deep Cleanse, first ever sale, probably our hottest selling product, but we can't ever keep it in stock, so we can't get enough supply of it, so it's not our best seller, because we just can't keep it.
[01:37:38.536 --> 01:37:44.579]  I'm just discounting it on top of that, 17% off, and free shipping.
[01:37:44.579 --> 01:37:51.242]  And the Wake Up America Coffee Special, two bags of InfoWars coffee, super high quality from the high mountains, non-GMO,
[01:37:52.481 --> 01:37:55.363]  Handpicked by the local Chiapas farmers.
[01:37:55.363 --> 01:37:57.085]  Organic volcanic soil.
[01:37:57.085 --> 01:37:59.366]  And get an InfoWars mug free.
[01:37:59.366 --> 01:38:01.908]  All supplies last.
[01:38:01.908 --> 01:38:07.253]  And a lot more at InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:38:07.253 --> 01:38:11.256]  And it is your purchase of the products that makes everything here possible.
[01:38:11.256 --> 01:38:16.500]  And in closing, it's important, just as important as buying products from us and checking them out.
[01:38:16.500 --> 01:38:18.721]  They're great prices, high quality, game changers.
[01:38:19.602 --> 01:38:28.767]  It's supporting our local Aminathem affiliates, becoming a sponsor, letting sponsors know why you're supporting them, letting stations know why you're supporting them, buying a billboard for the station.
[01:38:28.767 --> 01:38:47.738]  If people of means, middle class, upper middle class, nouveau riche, old money, if you don't start fighting, folks, if you don't start taking action like the producers of Amerageddon have done and others have done, if you don't get involved in the fight now, we will lose everything.
[01:38:47.738 --> 01:38:48.359]  It's that simple.
[01:38:50.456 --> 01:38:53.597]  Now is the time.
[01:38:53.597 --> 01:38:59.399]  Now is the time to choose sides, because sitting in the middle is choosing a side, you're joining the globalists.
[01:38:59.399 --> 01:39:06.822]  They want you to sit on your butt and watch television all day or, you know, watch the Kardashians.
[01:39:06.822 --> 01:39:09.242]  They don't want you to be informed and involved in taking action.
[01:39:09.242 --> 01:39:11.963]  They want you thinking of it as work.
[01:39:11.963 --> 01:39:15.504]  You're going to lose your freedom and lose your prosperity if you don't fight these people.
[01:39:15.504 --> 01:39:19.746]  And it's pretty easy to beat them because their program is so outrageous if we just take action.
[01:39:21.397 --> 01:39:22.317]  Everybody can see it.
[01:39:22.317 --> 01:39:24.558]  Now is the time.
[01:39:24.558 --> 01:39:27.498]  And Donald Trump is in the arena.
[01:39:27.498 --> 01:39:29.299]  They're taking out of context what he has to say.
[01:39:29.299 --> 01:39:31.039]  Some of the things he said I don't even agree with.
[01:39:31.039 --> 01:39:31.839]  It doesn't matter.
[01:39:31.839 --> 01:39:33.699]  He's exposing the globalist agenda.
[01:39:33.699 --> 01:39:35.260]  The big banks that are tax-exempt.
[01:39:35.260 --> 01:39:36.440]  The open borders.
[01:39:36.440 --> 01:39:37.400]  World government.
[01:39:37.400 --> 01:39:39.180]  The plan to de-industrialize us.
[01:39:39.180 --> 01:39:41.721]  The plan that China gets to have carbon taxes on us.
[01:39:41.721 --> 01:39:43.961]  They have no carbon taxes to shut us down.
[01:39:43.961 --> 01:39:45.002]  He's telling the truth.
[01:39:45.002 --> 01:39:45.982]  98% of the time.
[01:39:49.718 --> 01:39:53.143]  There's another report out at Infowars.com, the plan.
[01:39:53.143 --> 01:39:56.308]  We ought to air some of this in the fourth hour today with the delegates.
[01:39:57.449 --> 01:40:05.114]  The run by Democrats in the Republican Party basically to make sure Donald Trump or Rand Paul or somebody like Ted Cruz doesn't get in.
[01:40:05.114 --> 01:40:06.995]  All right, enough of me ranting and raving.
[01:40:06.995 --> 01:40:10.838]  Let's go back now and give them the floor until we got a break in 10 minutes, 11 minutes.
[01:40:10.838 --> 01:40:18.223]  Alex Newman of the New American Magazine, investigative journalist in Paris for this key world government event now taking place.
[01:40:18.223 --> 01:40:21.025]  Continue to roll through all the different areas that you've been breaking down.
[01:40:22.504 --> 01:40:22.824]  Excellent.
[01:40:22.824 --> 01:40:23.945]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:40:23.945 --> 01:40:27.368]  It's a pleasure to be able to share this information with your listeners.
[01:40:27.368 --> 01:40:33.634]  I think one of the things that the American people really need to know about here is we must stop this and we can stop this.
[01:40:33.634 --> 01:40:38.918]  Right now, the politics of this is such that everybody here understands the U.S.
[01:40:38.918 --> 01:40:42.321]  Congress is not necessarily ready to play along with this.
[01:40:42.321 --> 01:40:44.783]  Senator Inhofe appeared on Monday here in Paris
[01:40:45.083 --> 01:40:45.904]  We're good to go.
[01:41:06.154 --> 01:41:07.595]  We're good to go.
[01:41:30.727 --> 01:41:36.353]  It's not a theoretical problem, it's not a political problem, but we as Americans can take action to stop this.
[01:41:36.353 --> 01:41:39.336]  And really, America is the only hope for stopping this.
[01:41:39.336 --> 01:41:44.421]  You know, there's a big charade here about, oh, Saudi Arabia isn't playing along, China's not playing along.
[01:41:44.421 --> 01:41:49.166]  And, you know, they point the finger at it, they give out the fossil awards, and they say different governments aren't playing along.
[01:41:49.506 --> 01:41:50.327]  It's all a sham.
[01:41:50.327 --> 01:41:51.870]  They're all on board with this.
[01:41:51.870 --> 01:41:52.951]  China is on board with this.
[01:41:52.951 --> 01:42:05.329]  They love the idea that America is going to destroy its economy, move what little remains of our industry and our manufacturing over to China because it's too expensive to manufacture things in the United States thanks to the carbon taxes and Obama's power plan.
[01:42:05.769 --> 01:42:07.150]  So we need to stop this.
[01:42:07.150 --> 01:42:14.537]  Our prosperity, our liberty, our independence, our rights, and the future of our children and our grandchildren depend on putting a stop to this.
[01:42:14.537 --> 01:42:18.581]  And I think we can still do it if we put enough pressure on our elected representatives.
[01:42:18.581 --> 01:42:19.742]  And we have to be informed about it.
[01:42:19.742 --> 01:42:21.743]  There's plenty of information out there.
[01:42:21.743 --> 01:42:24.906]  There's plenty of science out there that people can use to educate themselves.
[01:42:24.906 --> 01:42:29.911]  If you're a scientist, if you're an expert, if you understand this stuff, if you have a PhD or a master's degree,
[01:42:30.669 --> 01:42:36.392]  Pick up a copy of the NIPCC report, the Non-Governmental International Panel on Climate Change.
[01:42:36.392 --> 01:42:45.516]  What they did is they looked at all the peer-reviewed data, all the same reports that the UN was looking at, and they exposed the flaws in the United Nations conclusions and in their theory.
[01:42:45.516 --> 01:42:48.298]  And it's not even really a theory anymore, it's totally discredited.
[01:42:49.599 --> 01:42:53.664]  That's another point I'll emphasize here, just in case there are any climate alarmists listening.
[01:42:53.664 --> 01:43:00.311]  I mean, the climate alarmists told us that as CO2 concentrations increased in the atmosphere, we were going to see increased global warming.
[01:43:00.311 --> 01:43:08.981]  We have had no global warming in 19 years, according to all five official data sets, the surface data collected by different government agencies around the world.
[01:43:10.542 --> 01:43:11.763]  All of their models were wrong.
[01:43:11.763 --> 01:43:15.404]  The UN had 73 models in their last IPCC report.
[01:43:15.404 --> 01:43:17.645]  Every single one of them predicted warming.
[01:43:17.645 --> 01:43:18.546]  A lot of warming.
[01:43:18.546 --> 01:43:19.966]  Accelerated warming.
[01:43:19.966 --> 01:43:23.568]  As more CO2 went into the atmosphere, instead we've had flat temperatures.
[01:43:23.568 --> 01:43:25.248]  They predicted a melting Antarctic.
[01:43:25.248 --> 01:43:27.870]  It's not melting, it's growing by massive amounts.
[01:43:27.870 --> 01:43:32.552]  They predicted that the oceans were going to become acidified because of CO2 and that things were going to die.
[01:43:32.552 --> 01:43:33.672]  The opposite is happening.
[01:43:33.712 --> 01:43:42.221]  Alex, I said I'd give you the floor and you're totally on target like Lord Monckton and Mark Moreno and everybody else and all the scientists I've had on, but we know it's a fraud.
[01:43:42.221 --> 01:43:54.934]  For me, attacking the fact that they're exempt, they have diplomatic immunity, that Al Gore and all these groups actually get part of our tax money, for me, looking at this, that's what kills this, is that it's a criminal takeover.
[01:43:54.934 --> 01:43:55.715]  It's ridiculous.
[01:43:55.715 --> 01:43:56.336]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:43:57.185 --> 01:43:57.725]  That's right.
[01:43:57.725 --> 01:44:15.897]  Even if the science were correct, which it's not, I challenge everybody to look it up if you have any doubts, but even if the science were correct, the so-called policy prescriptions are absolute suicide for everybody except the globalists, everybody except the Goldman Sachs, the big businesses that are sponsoring this, and people need to understand that.
[01:44:15.897 --> 01:44:19.700]  We are talking about condemning ourselves to poverty, our children to poverty, and
[01:44:20.380 --> 01:44:22.483]  Millions, billions of people in the third world.
[01:44:22.483 --> 01:44:25.246]  It's institutionalized serfdom.
[01:44:25.246 --> 01:44:26.207]  I'm sorry, it is.
[01:44:26.207 --> 01:44:28.290]  It's institutionalized serfdom.
[01:44:28.290 --> 01:44:32.295]  It's a perfect way to describe it, Alex, because that is what the world we're going toward.
[01:44:32.295 --> 01:44:35.719]  Why is Communist China playing such a big role in these negotiations?
[01:44:35.719 --> 01:44:38.262]  Because that is the kind of model they want for the world.
[01:44:38.622 --> 01:44:49.669]  Outright totalitarianism, no freedom of speech, lots of special privileges for the rulers, lots of oppression for the ruled, and the climate hoax is a crucial element of the agenda.
[01:44:49.669 --> 01:44:51.710]  It's not the only element, but it's crucial.
[01:44:51.710 --> 01:44:58.354]  When they can demonize carbon dioxide as pollution, they can control and regulate every aspect of our lives.
[01:44:58.354 --> 01:45:04.377]  There is no human activity that doesn't produce carbon dioxide, including me sitting here on this chair and exhaling.
[01:45:04.377 --> 01:45:05.638]  That produces carbon dioxide.
[01:45:05.638 --> 01:45:07.699]  Every time you take a breath, that's carbon dioxide.
[01:45:07.759 --> 01:45:09.342]  And they say that is a pollutant.
[01:45:09.342 --> 01:45:13.610]  Even the New York Times, as you know, admitted six, seven years ago, it was a headline, attacks on breathing.
[01:45:13.610 --> 01:45:15.935]  They're actually saying what we exhale is evil.
[01:45:15.935 --> 01:45:17.338]  How asinine is that?
[01:45:17.338 --> 01:45:19.321]  I mean, this is so obviously anti-human.
[01:45:20.416 --> 01:45:21.177]  That's exactly right.
[01:45:21.177 --> 01:45:23.859]  And you know, when I was little, I used to joke they're going to try to tax the air, right?
[01:45:23.859 --> 01:45:25.401]  They're going to try to tax our breathing.
[01:45:25.401 --> 01:45:26.221]  And here it is!
[01:45:26.221 --> 01:45:28.123]  I'm sitting in Paris and that's what they're talking about.
[01:45:28.123 --> 01:45:32.607]  Putting a tax on the gas of life that we all exhale.
[01:45:32.607 --> 01:45:35.690]  It's absurd, it's criminal, and it needs to be exposed.
[01:45:35.690 --> 01:45:38.773]  And thank you so much, Alex, for what you're doing to bring attention to this issue.
[01:45:41.283 --> 01:45:45.284]  Continue with what you've witnessed, what you've seen, other key points watching this conference.
[01:45:45.284 --> 01:45:48.786]  I mean, please go over all that, but I just want to go back again.
[01:45:48.786 --> 01:45:55.468]  Unelected world government, they admit they're integrating it with the TPP, integrating it with the NAU, the EU.
[01:45:55.468 --> 01:46:04.031]  I mean, this is just a huge transference of power from our already corrupt national governments to totally diplomatically immune shadow groups of
[01:46:05.373 --> 01:46:09.722]  Of rock stars and movie stars stumbling around with hookers all around them.
[01:46:09.722 --> 01:46:12.527]  I mean, I've been watching the TV telling us how to live.
[01:46:12.527 --> 01:46:14.511]  I mean, this is just, this is too rich.
[01:46:15.680 --> 01:46:18.222]  That's right, and it's very evident from the treaty that's come out.
[01:46:18.222 --> 01:46:19.543]  It's still got a lot of brackets in it.
[01:46:19.543 --> 01:46:22.146]  They're supposedly negotiating what's going to stay in and come out.
[01:46:22.146 --> 01:46:27.030]  But it's very evident from the treaty that we're going to be giving the United Nations all kinds of new powers.
[01:46:27.030 --> 01:46:38.000]  Every government in the world, national government, especially Western governments, is going to be accountable to this climate regime and to implement all the measures inside of it if this is going to be codified into international law.
[01:46:38.560 --> 01:46:39.100]  I think so.
[01:47:08.191 --> 01:47:13.756]  Wait, are you about to criticize the fact that Saudi Arabia runs the UN Human Rights Commission?
[01:47:13.756 --> 01:47:14.397]  That too.
[01:47:14.397 --> 01:47:18.020]  But this G70, the Human Rights Commission, don't even get me started, Alex.
[01:47:18.020 --> 01:47:19.141]  It is such a joke.
[01:47:19.141 --> 01:47:23.305]  You put mass murderers, genocidal maniacs, communist dictators on a Human Rights Commission.
[01:47:23.305 --> 01:47:26.728]  Why are you being racist against dictators and genocidal maniacs?
[01:47:26.728 --> 01:47:27.509]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:47:27.509 --> 01:47:27.890]  Is that a race?
[01:47:29.551 --> 01:47:34.032]  But no, the G77 plus communist China here, we've been trying to score an interview with them since we got here.
[01:47:34.032 --> 01:47:34.813]  They won't give it to us.
[01:47:34.813 --> 01:47:37.633]  They keep saying, oh, come back later, send us an email, you know, blah, blah, blah.
[01:47:37.633 --> 01:47:38.714]  They don't want to talk to us.
[01:47:38.714 --> 01:47:51.838]  But they put out a statement early on this week saying, if you Western governments don't fork over $100 billion a year to start in climate reparations and significantly more was the term they used after 2020, none of this is going anywhere.
[01:47:51.838 --> 01:47:53.218]  We're not going to play along here.
[01:47:53.218 --> 01:47:55.599]  So this is an extortion racket they're demanding.
[01:47:56.399 --> 01:48:01.263]  Massive international wealth redistribution from the poor people in the western country, you know, the middle class.
[01:48:01.263 --> 01:48:01.984]  This is what they do.
[01:48:01.984 --> 01:48:03.205]  They want to devastate us.
[01:48:03.205 --> 01:48:04.046]  Right.
[01:48:04.046 --> 01:48:04.666]  It's a scam.
[01:48:04.666 --> 01:48:09.050]  And they want all of this wealth transferred to them under the guise of climate reparations.
[01:48:09.050 --> 01:48:11.712]  They say, well, the West emitted carbon dioxide.
[01:48:11.712 --> 01:48:13.533]  So, you know, now we had an industrial revolution.
[01:48:13.533 --> 01:48:16.015]  We had technological progress.
[01:48:16.015 --> 01:48:18.337]  We developed medicines and agriculture.
[01:48:18.337 --> 01:48:18.738]  And so now
[01:48:19.511 --> 01:48:27.615]  For that, now we need to pay them back with climate reparations so that their dictatorships can stash their money in the secret bank accounts and better oppress their people.
[01:48:27.615 --> 01:48:34.198]  It is disgusting that this could be happening, and it's even more disgusting that the press here is taking this whole sham seriously.
[01:48:34.198 --> 01:48:37.919]  So thank you, Alex, for, you know, just getting the word out there about this.
[01:48:37.919 --> 01:48:41.741]  There's so few voices out there that are exposing this hoax for what it is.
[01:48:41.741 --> 01:48:43.922]  I know the American people are catching on to this.
[01:48:43.922 --> 01:48:44.722]  It's becoming clear.
[01:48:44.722 --> 01:48:46.103]  We had a poll from Pew last year.
[01:48:46.503 --> 01:48:50.926]  Less than 40% of the American people believe in the anthropogenic global warming theory.
[01:48:50.926 --> 01:48:52.947]  So the American people aren't on board with this.
[01:48:52.947 --> 01:49:00.232]  But to hear it at this conference, the whole world is demanding climate justice and that we all enslave ourselves to this UN climate regime.
[01:49:00.232 --> 01:49:02.513]  And the American people are the key to stopping it.
[01:49:02.513 --> 01:49:05.035]  So everybody who's listening to this needs to get busy.
[01:49:05.035 --> 01:49:06.135]  Educate yourself.
[01:49:06.135 --> 01:49:07.836]  Educate your elected officials.
[01:49:07.836 --> 01:49:10.438]  If your elected officials won't listen, replace them.
[01:49:11.332 --> 01:49:14.753]  Now, I'm showing my cell phone on television right now.
[01:49:14.753 --> 01:49:17.734]  My handheld tracking computer is what it really is.
[01:49:17.734 --> 01:49:27.576]  And my dad sent me this a few days ago, so I actually picked one of these December 4th Chronicles up and forgot to bring it to work today.
[01:49:27.576 --> 01:49:29.576]  So all I have is the screenshot.
[01:49:29.576 --> 01:49:38.158]  But just opening it up and literally spending maybe two minutes at red lights yesterday looking at it.
[01:49:38.158 --> 01:49:40.459]  But again, I do have a screenshot of it to show TV viewers here.
[01:49:41.912 --> 01:49:47.903]  The Chronicle had an article about shaking down super liberal Kirby Lane cafes for money.
[01:49:49.542 --> 01:50:15.853]  and complaints because two Islamic women were wearing headdresses in there and claimed somebody said go back to Saudi Arabia and then they demanded the guy be thrown out and Kirby Lane said sorry we didn't see him say it the manager didn't make a scene put the guys on the other side of the restaurant they were you know waiting to be seated no proof this even happened and it's a big cover story let's skip this network break I have to because of time constraints and they're making a huge deal of it
[01:50:16.593 --> 01:50:18.514]  That was one article I wanted to show folks.
[01:50:18.514 --> 01:50:19.715]  The big Kirby Lane conspiracy.
[01:50:19.715 --> 01:50:20.796]  You can actually find it online.
[01:50:20.796 --> 01:50:25.659]  Just type in Kirby Lane controversy, Austin Chronicle crew.
[01:50:25.659 --> 01:50:26.700]  We can show it to folks.
[01:50:26.700 --> 01:50:28.441]  I wasn't thinking, hey, we don't have to have the paper.
[01:50:28.441 --> 01:50:29.962]  We have it digitally.
[01:50:29.962 --> 01:50:30.543]  But look at this.
[01:50:30.543 --> 01:50:31.123]  From the paper.
[01:50:31.123 --> 01:50:31.964]  A screenshot.
[01:50:31.964 --> 01:50:32.864]  A photo.
[01:50:32.864 --> 01:50:34.745]  New World Order throwing it in our face.
[01:50:35.606 --> 01:50:42.490]  This is just what's in the local paper, just filled with how mothers and fathers are bad and turn your guns in and world government's good.
[01:50:42.490 --> 01:50:43.511]  Watch your language.
[01:50:43.511 --> 01:50:55.918]  Number one, recently added to the list of words and phrases to be offensive and officially discouraged on campus according to the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee website, because they're God and they say so.
[01:50:55.918 --> 01:50:57.519]  Political correctness.
[01:50:57.519 --> 01:51:04.643]  The phrase is said to be microaggression that might make some students feel uncomfortable or unsafe if they hear it.
[01:51:06.644 --> 01:51:09.346]  And then it goes on to say, read it on page two.
[01:51:09.346 --> 01:51:18.774]  So they sit there with a straight face, a total cult, saying you will not use the word political correctness even though that's a Soviet term they themselves used.
[01:51:18.774 --> 01:51:23.418]  I mean, this shows these people know they're taking over the whole language.
[01:51:23.418 --> 01:51:27.862]  Up at a university in Pennsylvania, we reported yesterday, this was mainstream news, AP reported,
[01:51:28.882 --> 01:51:29.523]  I'm not against Kirby Lane.
[01:51:29.523 --> 01:51:30.363]  It's a fine place to eat.
[01:51:30.363 --> 01:51:31.444]  I go there sometimes.
[01:51:46.338 --> 01:52:00.024]  The point is, it's super liberal, super trendy, and now they have the owners prostrating themselves, begging to some made-up phantom, probably more made-up than the poop swastika or all the fake other things they've admitted is garbage.
[01:52:00.024 --> 01:52:04.646]  And so, but separately, they're in here saying, Alex, you will
[01:52:05.626 --> 01:52:11.031]  Talk like we talk and you will not use the word political correctness so they can destroy language.
[01:52:11.031 --> 01:52:14.835]  So they can totally and completely dominate everything people are saying.
[01:52:14.835 --> 01:52:21.081]  So now they're saying the name of a study hall is called Lynch Hall after a patron of the school.
[01:52:21.081 --> 01:52:28.409]  Nothing to do with lynching, it's an Irish name, means seaman, means boatman, means person of the sea, means man in longboat, really means Viking.
[01:52:29.009 --> 01:52:37.797]  If you go back to the original Gaelic, and they want that ban saying the word scares them, but they don't want Loretta Lynch, the Attorney General, to change her name.
[01:52:37.797 --> 01:52:44.663]  This is nothing but exercise of raw cult power, and even the idiot kids know it's about power.
[01:52:44.663 --> 01:52:49.427]  Even the idiot 20-year-olds who are arrested development children know it's about power.
[01:52:49.427 --> 01:52:54.231]  Even with true liberals at Yale that said, we will not ban people having private Halloween parties.
[01:52:54.231 --> 01:52:55.892]  If you're offended by a cowboy or an Indian,
[01:52:56.633 --> 01:53:03.757]  Literally the letter said then you need to just look away because this is what free speech is and they've now resigned.
[01:53:03.757 --> 01:53:13.301]  So this is how free on these little reservations they are where they're growing these pod people to then put them in charge at every level in uniform running our lives.
[01:53:13.301 --> 01:53:14.042]  Sorry, go ahead Alex.
[01:53:15.110 --> 01:53:19.352]  You know, the language manipulation element of this is crucial.
[01:53:19.352 --> 01:53:24.034]  I think that's one of the ways that they've suckered all these journalists into playing along with this scam.
[01:53:24.034 --> 01:53:26.835]  I can give you just one example of, you know, hundreds.
[01:53:26.835 --> 01:53:28.315]  They talk about all the parties here.
[01:53:28.315 --> 01:53:30.256]  This is the conference of the parties, right?
[01:53:30.256 --> 01:53:31.497]  That's what the COP stands for.
[01:53:31.497 --> 01:53:34.338]  The parties, they keep referring to them as countries.
[01:53:34.338 --> 01:53:36.639]  Now, is Raul Castro a country?
[01:53:36.639 --> 01:53:40.400]  Is the mass murdering dictatorship in Beijing a country?
[01:53:40.400 --> 01:53:41.701]  Is Robert Mugabe a country?
[01:53:41.701 --> 01:53:42.821]  No, it's the regime!
[01:53:42.821 --> 01:53:44.202]  It's a gang with a flag.
[01:53:45.104 --> 01:53:45.604]  Exactly.
[01:53:45.604 --> 01:53:50.907]  These are gangsters and mass murderers who've somehow managed to take over a country and oppress the citizens of the country.
[01:53:50.907 --> 01:53:52.208]  So we should stop with the charade.
[01:53:52.208 --> 01:53:53.689]  There's no countries here.
[01:53:53.689 --> 01:54:03.695]  There's government, there's fake activists that are funded by government, there's fake media that are funded by government, and there's a bunch of servants to wait on all these people from the government.
[01:54:04.575 --> 01:54:13.621]  It's just one example of countless that I could cite of how the left and how the United Nations and how the totalitarians are manipulating language and the effect that it has on people.
[01:54:13.621 --> 01:54:24.247]  You know, when you hear that countries are negotiating to save the world from climate change, if you're not well educated, it's easy to be susceptible to this kind of group think, oh, countries, that's wonderful.
[01:54:24.707 --> 01:54:26.628]  Because it's a tissue of lies.
[01:54:26.628 --> 01:54:28.889]  I mean, they're creating an entire atmosphere of baloney.
[01:54:28.889 --> 01:54:30.570]  Our Congress can't even see these agreements.
[01:54:30.570 --> 01:54:32.411]  They're still secret, most of them.
[01:54:32.411 --> 01:54:34.132]  We couldn't see the Copenhagen Agreement.
[01:54:34.132 --> 01:54:35.792]  We couldn't see the TPP.
[01:54:35.792 --> 01:54:38.254]  But you just hear, oh, your leaders are there negotiating.
[01:54:38.254 --> 01:54:49.299]  No, criminals are there negotiating personal money of ours to themselves, total racketeering, total gangster fraud, beyond anything Al Capone could ever imagine.
[01:54:50.205 --> 01:54:51.306]  You're exactly right, Alex.
[01:54:51.306 --> 01:54:53.508]  That's a perfect description of what's happening here.
[01:54:53.508 --> 01:54:54.950]  It's a criminal operation.
[01:54:54.950 --> 01:55:02.457]  They're talking about how they're going to divide up our wealth, how they're going to strip away our liberties, how quickly they're going to implode our economies, and it's unacceptable.
[01:55:02.457 --> 01:55:06.321]  The people of the world, the actual countries, need to say, enough of this scam.
[01:55:06.321 --> 01:55:10.845]  Congress needs to say, no more money for Obama's global warming, no more money for negotiations.
[01:55:10.945 --> 01:55:17.273]  The so-called communist beatniks at the Chronicle, the owner, literally makes like 20 million dollars a year, owns South by Southwest.
[01:55:17.273 --> 01:55:25.603]  He says you shouldn't be able to have a car, basically, or a gun, even though he lives in armored palaces and has bodyguards and pays his staff almost nothing.
[01:55:25.603 --> 01:55:28.547]  He says you will use the words he says.
[01:55:28.547 --> 01:55:29.649]  You want to bow down to him right now?
[01:55:30.851 --> 01:55:36.354]  He tried to have my magazines we gave out free banned downtown two years ago.
[01:55:36.354 --> 01:55:41.697]  I mean, shouldn't we just kneel because he has curly long hair and a big belly and go, you're liberal!
[01:55:41.697 --> 01:55:42.437]  We worship you!
[01:55:42.437 --> 01:55:43.438]  You're our God!
[01:55:43.438 --> 01:55:44.919]  We'll talk like you say!
[01:55:44.919 --> 01:55:46.139]  We love your party!
[01:55:46.139 --> 01:55:49.101]  We love the death mills and all the dead babies!
[01:55:49.101 --> 01:55:50.082]  We worship you!
[01:55:50.082 --> 01:55:50.722]  You're the boss!
[01:55:51.042 --> 01:55:51.482]  Absolutely.
[01:55:51.482 --> 01:55:54.284]  You're not a totalitarian freak, control freak.
[01:55:54.284 --> 01:55:55.825]  You're not a giant gang.
[01:55:55.825 --> 01:55:58.747]  You're a bunch of loving liberals, because you said so.
[01:55:58.747 --> 01:56:02.089]  I'm sorry, Alex Newman, New American Magazine.
[01:56:02.089 --> 01:56:02.810]  That's right.
[01:56:02.810 --> 01:56:04.531]  The hypocrisy is off the charts.
[01:56:04.531 --> 01:56:09.214]  They're showing up in private jets so Arnold Schwarzenegger can lecture us about not eating meat.
[01:56:09.214 --> 01:56:10.575]  Well, he said kill yourself.
[01:56:10.575 --> 01:56:11.716]  He said kill yourself.
[01:56:12.472 --> 01:56:13.473]  He said, kill yourself!
[01:56:35.175 --> 01:56:39.299]  Because he told Rolling Stone in 1978, I want to be a dictator.
[01:56:39.299 --> 01:56:40.540]  I like Hitler.
[01:56:40.540 --> 01:56:42.302]  I want to tell people what to do.
[01:56:42.302 --> 01:56:43.663]  Now these are real quotes.
[01:56:43.663 --> 01:56:45.305]  I want to tell you what to do.
[01:56:45.305 --> 01:56:47.747]  I want to be remembered more than Jesus.
[01:56:47.747 --> 01:56:48.848]  I like Hitler.
[01:56:48.848 --> 01:56:52.652]  And he reportedly to the makers of that film Pumping Iron.
[01:56:54.079 --> 01:56:58.605]  He literally answers the door in SS uniforms playing records of Hitler's speeches.
[01:56:58.605 --> 01:57:02.030]  I mean, but it's okay, because the ADL loves him.
[01:57:02.030 --> 01:57:10.201]  The product of an SS breeding program, getting awards from the ADL, just like they give awards to George Soros, the top living Nazi collaborator.
[01:57:11.169 --> 01:57:12.510]  Yeah, and you know who else is here?
[01:57:12.510 --> 01:57:13.711]  We saw him yesterday in the hallway.
[01:57:13.711 --> 01:57:18.094]  I tried to chase him down for an interview, but of course he doesn't want to talk to non-propaganda media.
[01:57:18.094 --> 01:57:35.165]  But we have John Holdren here, Obama's science guy, the guy who wrote a book saying we need forced abortion, that we need to put sterilizing agents in the water supply so that people need to ask permission to have children, the guy who wants to exterminate people, the guy who blames record cold and record snow on global warming.
[01:57:35.165 --> 01:57:40.749]  Let me quote Floyd Facker publicly in Rolling Stone while they were in the gym in Venice Beach in front of him.
[01:57:41.489 --> 01:57:42.890]  Down with the blacks!
[01:57:42.890 --> 01:57:46.591]  You're the people, not humans!
[01:57:46.591 --> 01:57:50.873]  And meanwhile, though, he then joins with the left to dismantle the West.
[01:57:50.873 --> 01:57:54.454]  I mean, you talk about us, he thinks he can dominate us with Soros.
[01:57:54.454 --> 01:57:59.196]  Let me tell you something, Schwarzenegger, I can look at you and tell that your ticket's about to be punched.
[01:57:59.196 --> 01:58:04.118]  You look like you're warmed over dead, and no amount of heart surgeries or anything's going to save you.
[01:58:04.118 --> 01:58:07.599]  You are damned to Hades, Schwarzenegger, if there's any justice in this world.
[01:58:07.839 --> 01:58:13.077]  I'm sorry, but these are sick, demonic, eugenic, sick ghouls feeding on us.
[01:58:13.077 --> 01:58:13.438]  I'm sorry.
[01:58:13.438 --> 01:58:13.820]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:58:14.816 --> 01:58:20.138]  You're right, Alex, and we need to be very clear with our elected officials that this is not going to fly.
[01:58:20.138 --> 01:58:21.939]  The American people need to stand up.
[01:58:21.939 --> 01:58:24.901]  We're the last hope for stopping this charade that's happening.
[01:58:24.901 --> 01:58:25.961]  Stay there, I'm gonna come back to you.
[01:58:25.961 --> 01:58:27.622]  Absolutely, I'll come back in five more minutes.
[01:58:27.622 --> 01:58:32.064]  I was just dreaming about being a dictator greater than Jesus.
[01:58:32.064 --> 01:58:33.364]  I want people to be under me.
[01:58:33.364 --> 01:58:35.966]  I want to tell them what to do.
[01:58:35.966 --> 01:58:37.726]  Those are real quotes, by the way.
[01:58:37.726 --> 01:58:38.167]  I love it.
[01:58:38.167 --> 01:58:41.668]  Sure!

[02:00:20.288 --> 02:00:21.448]  I want you.
[02:00:21.448 --> 02:00:21.808]  I need you.
[02:00:23.980 --> 02:00:43.971]  Mike Norris, the accomplished director, actor, progeny of the great and mighty King Norris will be joining us in studio.
[02:00:45.069 --> 02:00:46.670]  I'm a little bit wound up.
[02:00:46.670 --> 02:00:49.812]  Okay, only one cup of coffee so far today, but I am wound up right now.
[02:00:49.812 --> 02:00:52.393]  I am wound up.
[02:00:52.393 --> 02:00:53.114]  I am angry.
[02:00:53.114 --> 02:00:54.774]  I just, I get upset.
[02:00:54.774 --> 02:00:57.476]  But at the same time, I get happy when I'm fighting tyranny.
[02:00:57.476 --> 02:00:59.037]  So thank you for putting up with me.
[02:00:59.037 --> 02:01:00.158]  I'm going to control myself now.
[02:01:00.158 --> 02:01:05.260]  I'll be totally exhausted by this evening if I continue to bounce all over the walls here, but that's what's happening.
[02:01:05.260 --> 02:01:07.622]  Dems propose civil rights for illegals.
[02:01:07.622 --> 02:01:08.722]  ISIS to enter the U.S.
[02:01:08.722 --> 02:01:10.563]  Kit Daniels, Infowars.com.
[02:01:11.784 --> 02:01:16.648]  Senator Sessions has released the plan that they're planning to put through Congress.
[02:01:16.648 --> 02:01:20.712]  Any alien denied entry could file suit to demand entry and claims damages.
[02:01:20.712 --> 02:01:22.293]  That's for the lawyers to make money too.
[02:01:22.293 --> 02:01:25.696]  For lost employment, lost welfare benefits, lost income.
[02:01:25.696 --> 02:01:26.877]  And they want to let ISIS in.
[02:01:26.877 --> 02:01:29.860]  We'll break this down coming up later in the hour.
[02:01:29.860 --> 02:01:33.143]  But Alex Newman, again you have the fortune or misfortune of
[02:01:33.743 --> 02:01:38.349]  Joining me today in the last hour when I was in particular Piranha Mode.
[02:01:38.349 --> 02:01:38.949]  You're right though.
[02:01:38.949 --> 02:01:39.871]  This is the battle.
[02:01:39.871 --> 02:01:42.213]  The enemy's inside the gates.
[02:01:42.213 --> 02:01:43.976]  It's actually the animating contest of liberty.
[02:01:43.976 --> 02:01:50.684]  What can we do to expose the fact that the entire West is being usurped into an anti-human eugenics world government as we speak?
[02:01:52.052 --> 02:01:56.455]  I think one of the best things that people can do is, first of all, educate themselves and then spread the word.
[02:01:56.455 --> 02:02:04.861]  You know, share Alex Jones' program through your Twitter, through your Facebook, with your friends, share the New Americans articles, get the information out there so that people realize.
[02:02:04.861 --> 02:02:15.748]  Because what I've found, and we've interviewed a number of people who used to be global warming alarmists, we interviewed an engineer who quit his job to get involved in stopping global warming until he realized it was all a fraud.
[02:02:15.748 --> 02:02:17.269]  So the facts are compelling.
[02:02:17.269 --> 02:02:18.310]  The truth stands on its own.
[02:02:18.650 --> 02:02:21.272]  Yes, the globalists have billions, trillions of dollars.
[02:02:21.272 --> 02:02:23.693]  Yes, they have control of all the big media.
[02:02:23.693 --> 02:02:25.894]  And, you know, they're the rock stars here.
[02:02:25.894 --> 02:02:28.676]  But, you know, the truth stands on its own.
[02:02:28.676 --> 02:02:30.177]  We don't need the billions of dollars.
[02:02:30.177 --> 02:02:31.398]  We need the facts.
[02:02:31.398 --> 02:02:32.458]  We need the truth.
[02:02:32.458 --> 02:02:35.841]  And with those two weapons, we can stop this scam.
[02:02:35.841 --> 02:02:40.463]  And once the American people are sufficiently educated, we can work with our elected officials.
[02:02:40.463 --> 02:02:42.785]  And, you know, Congress could very easily stop this.
[02:02:42.785 --> 02:02:46.407]  Every Republican in Congress ran on a platform of stopping Obama.
[02:02:46.727 --> 02:02:48.829]  Now you have an opportunity to stop Obama.
[02:02:48.829 --> 02:02:53.932]  When you pass the budget, say, not one penny of this budget is going to climate negotiations.
[02:02:53.932 --> 02:02:59.836]  Not one penny of this budget is going to the cap and trade that you couldn't even get through the Democrat-controlled Congress.
[02:02:59.836 --> 02:03:02.558]  Not one penny of this money is going for the gun grab.
[02:03:02.558 --> 02:03:05.199]  Not one penny of this money is going for any of Obama's agenda.
[02:03:05.199 --> 02:03:09.382]  So Republicans who say, oh, we can't do anything, we need to win the White House, they're not telling the truth.
[02:03:09.382 --> 02:03:10.683]  They control the power of the purse.
[02:03:10.683 --> 02:03:16.287]  So if we get educated, if we educate our communities, if we educate our lawmakers, we can stop this.
[02:03:16.927 --> 02:03:17.648]  Don't squeeze, only tickle!
[02:03:39.494 --> 02:03:40.915]  There goes Schwarzenegger again, right?
[02:03:40.915 --> 02:03:43.117]  And there's a whole bunch of nutty American officials here.
[02:03:43.117 --> 02:03:49.280]  You have the EPA chief here, who's the one in charge of implementing all of Obama's... Well, I mean, I didn't want to go off on Schwarzenegger.
[02:03:49.280 --> 02:03:58.846]  I mean, I love some of his earlier movies, like Running Man and Predator, and Conan the Barbarian is just amazingly... not Conan the Destroyer, that's comedy, but Conan the Barbarian is amazing.
[02:03:59.426 --> 02:04:04.510]  I like Arnold Schwarzenegger as an actor, quite frankly, but as a person, he's an oppressive evil.
[02:04:04.510 --> 02:04:06.731]  He makes Lance Armstrong look like a humanitarian.
[02:04:06.731 --> 02:04:10.274]  I mean, the stuff he's been involved in, the arrogance, I hate him!
[02:04:10.274 --> 02:04:16.058]  He's just the antithesis of Americana, and I literally just want him out of my life.
[02:04:16.058 --> 02:04:23.563]  I mean, he literally is perching on me with munialization, trying to take over all the major cities and put us under carbon tax one way or the other.
[02:04:23.563 --> 02:04:26.745]  I mean, I'm sure, as you know, Alex, he quarterbacks that whole operation.
[02:04:27.895 --> 02:04:28.395]  Yep.
[02:04:28.395 --> 02:04:32.356]  And, you know, he's a good representative for the type of people who are here at this UN summit.
[02:04:32.356 --> 02:04:41.557]  They're, you know, at least at the upper levels, they're all totalitarian, they're all incredible hypocrites, and they all want to, like Arnold Schwarzenegger, you know, control your life.
[02:04:41.557 --> 02:04:44.638]  And so people need to understand... He says he admires Hitler.
[02:04:44.638 --> 02:04:46.178]  Listen, Alex, thank you so much.
[02:04:46.178 --> 02:04:46.958]  Great job.
[02:04:46.958 --> 02:04:53.099]  Folks can read your reports without all my screaming, but we need some screaming too, at the New American Magazine, newamerican.com.
[02:04:53.099 --> 02:04:54.100]  Thank you so much, brother.
[02:04:54.100 --> 02:04:56.280]  We'll be talking to you again soon, after you get back from Paris.
[02:04:57.120 --> 02:04:57.901]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[02:04:57.901 --> 02:05:00.242]  Mike Norris is coming up.
[02:05:00.242 --> 02:05:01.143]  Red Alert!
[02:05:01.143 --> 02:05:07.167]  Obama brings in 13,000 Muslims who support suicide bombings every year.
[02:05:07.167 --> 02:05:08.088]  Let me explain.
[02:05:08.088 --> 02:05:15.432]  This headline is based upon Pew Research polling data, which is among the most respected polling firms in the world.
[02:05:15.432 --> 02:05:23.218]  And it is an alarming statistic considering the reality of the Pew Research poll that says 13% of Muslims inside of the United States
[02:05:25.179 --> 02:05:27.080]  Now they're worried about three-year-old orphans.
[02:05:44.892 --> 02:05:50.118]  But facts are facts, regardless of the Obama administration's decision to ignore them.
[02:05:50.118 --> 02:05:56.365]  The radical mindset of the Muslim population in America is here, and it is growing.

[02:08:08.030 --> 02:08:18.077]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:18.077 --> 02:08:26.522]  You want some rock and roll intro, buddy?
[02:08:26.522 --> 02:08:27.082]  You got it.
[02:08:27.082 --> 02:08:29.764]  Deep Purple, Smoke on the Water.
[02:08:29.764 --> 02:08:33.427]  Some amazing guitar coming up here in just a moment.
[02:08:33.427 --> 02:08:33.787]  Right here.
[02:08:36.212 --> 02:08:38.075]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[02:08:38.075 --> 02:08:38.375]  to 3 p.m.
[02:08:38.375 --> 02:08:39.297]  Central.
[02:08:39.297 --> 02:08:40.939]  We're here live.
[02:08:40.939 --> 02:08:44.364]  Mike Norris, accomplished filmmaker.
[02:08:44.364 --> 02:08:47.208]  Here it is, coming up.
[02:08:47.208 --> 02:08:49.251]  Documentary filmmaker, TV maker, actor.
[02:08:52.240 --> 02:08:55.002]  And, of course, the firstborn son of Chuck Norris.
[02:08:55.002 --> 02:08:56.843]  It doesn't get any better than that.
[02:08:56.843 --> 02:08:57.723]  And we are very flattered.
[02:08:57.723 --> 02:08:59.304]  Chuck Norris, of course, has been on the show a few times.
[02:08:59.304 --> 02:09:00.845]  I know he is a listener.
[02:09:00.845 --> 02:09:06.449]  And, of course, nice photo you sent us of you down there at the ranch with him with the Infowars.com shirt.
[02:09:06.449 --> 02:09:15.194]  Before we get into Amerageddon premiere, this trailer, talk about all the censorship and things that it has basically gone through.
[02:09:16.644 --> 02:09:21.985]  What about the idea of drafting Chuck Norris 2016?
[02:09:21.985 --> 02:09:30.028]  I think he would be even way more invincible and measured in what he said than somebody like even Donald Trump.
[02:09:30.028 --> 02:09:30.688]  And I like Donald Trump.
[02:09:30.688 --> 02:09:32.948]  He's been on the odyssey as the big Republican leader.
[02:09:32.948 --> 02:09:35.629]  Or what about a Chuck Norris, Donald Trump ticket?
[02:09:35.629 --> 02:09:39.310]  I mean, I know your dad is known for being super incredibly humble.
[02:09:39.750 --> 02:09:41.972]  Never have seen him at Republican events over time.
[02:09:41.972 --> 02:09:43.734]  He doesn't like people really complimenting him.
[02:09:43.734 --> 02:09:51.342]  But I mean, come on, we need somebody who's been a filmmaker, an entrepreneur, you know, world champion, you know, in karate, in his own right.
[02:09:52.287 --> 02:09:57.468]  From Texas or from Oklahoma, you know, who's been in the military the whole nine yards, versus these lawyers.
[02:09:57.468 --> 02:09:59.469]  And Ted Cruz is a lawyer, I like him.
[02:09:59.469 --> 02:10:02.750]  But I like Rand Paul because he's an optometrist or whatever.
[02:10:02.750 --> 02:10:04.530]  Trump, he's a self-made billionaire.
[02:10:04.530 --> 02:10:09.151]  I really am just sick of these inside-the-beltway people that are smoking their own dope.
[02:10:09.151 --> 02:10:20.794]  But Mike Norris, before we get into America and all things Chuck Norris, you always tell me some cool stuff behind-the-scenes baseball, and we're going to work to get your dad on soon, but he's really kind of been chilling out, writing for WorldNet daily, and he deserves that.
[02:10:21.634 --> 02:10:25.540]  But, wow, I mean, America needs Chuck Norris.
[02:10:25.540 --> 02:10:27.041]  How great would that be?
[02:10:27.041 --> 02:10:29.665]  To have my dad as the President of the United States.
[02:10:29.665 --> 02:10:37.815]  I mean, it's been great to kind of witness his evolution into the film industry, but, wow, President would be great.
[02:10:38.996 --> 02:10:39.376]  I'm in.
[02:10:39.376 --> 02:10:41.217]  I'd love to go to the White House to see him there.
[02:10:41.217 --> 02:10:43.878]  How long was he the top grossing action figure ever?
[02:10:43.878 --> 02:10:46.539]  I mean, wasn't like a decade he was the top grossing of all time?
[02:10:46.539 --> 02:10:51.841]  Yeah, every four months he'd have a new film come out, number one in the box office, and it was great.
[02:10:51.841 --> 02:10:56.903]  That was, you know, the 80s and 90s, and then he started on Walker, Texas Ranger, and that just kind of
[02:10:57.483 --> 02:10:59.285]  Took it to a whole nother level.
[02:10:59.285 --> 02:11:01.888]  You know, they can say they're going to have Chimera clones now.
[02:11:01.888 --> 02:11:06.232]  We could dig up John Wayne and then your dad could donate some stem cells.
[02:11:06.232 --> 02:11:09.336]  We could create a John Wayne Chuck Norris creature.
[02:11:10.990 --> 02:11:11.670]  I'm in.
[02:11:11.670 --> 02:11:13.571]  Let's throw a little Alex Jones in there, too.
[02:11:13.571 --> 02:11:14.991]  No, no, no.
[02:11:14.991 --> 02:11:17.832]  We'll throw Donald Trump's hair in, genetically.
[02:11:17.832 --> 02:11:20.232]  The creature will have Donald Trump's hair.
[02:11:20.232 --> 02:11:21.433]  I like his hair.
[02:11:21.433 --> 02:11:22.213]  What's wrong with it?
[02:11:22.213 --> 02:11:22.613]  I hear you.
[02:11:22.613 --> 02:11:26.794]  We'll mix in some Elvis.
[02:11:26.794 --> 02:11:29.155]  We'll dig up George Washington, mix in some of that.
[02:11:29.155 --> 02:11:30.355]  Little Ronald Reagan?
[02:11:30.355 --> 02:11:31.395]  Sure.
[02:11:31.395 --> 02:11:33.796]  We won't be mixing any Schwarzenegger in.
[02:11:33.796 --> 02:11:34.616]  Or Clinton.
[02:11:34.616 --> 02:11:36.437]  Or Clinton.
[02:11:36.437 --> 02:11:37.497]  Hillary, though, so beautiful.
[02:11:39.355 --> 02:11:41.979]  Sorry, just spit up a little bit.
[02:11:41.979 --> 02:11:43.621]  But no, I mean, could your dad be convinced?
[02:11:43.621 --> 02:11:45.403]  I mean, I know people brought it up to him.
[02:11:45.403 --> 02:11:46.605]  What would his reservations be?
[02:11:46.605 --> 02:11:48.106]  I mean, give any to running for president.
[02:11:48.956 --> 02:11:58.862]  You know, I think the idea of it is really cool, but, you know, he's so much into his foundation, his Kickstart Foundation.
[02:11:58.862 --> 02:11:59.903]  Helping kids.
[02:11:59.903 --> 02:12:01.624]  Helping kids.
[02:12:01.624 --> 02:12:04.525]  He's starting a new water company, Seaforce Water.
[02:12:04.525 --> 02:12:09.468]  So he's busy right now, but he's very in tune with what's happening in the world.
[02:12:09.468 --> 02:12:17.153]  He's very in tune with the media, knowing full well the media is, the mainstream media, is a lie.
[02:12:17.153 --> 02:12:17.953]  And I think that's,
[02:12:18.974 --> 02:12:23.978]  That's important because we need people like you and my father to let people know.
[02:12:23.978 --> 02:12:26.761]  Fox, CNN, ABC, NBC.
[02:12:26.761 --> 02:12:27.802]  It's all a lie.
[02:12:27.802 --> 02:12:30.504]  And if you really want to get news, where do we go?
[02:12:30.504 --> 02:12:31.305]  We go to Alex.
[02:12:31.305 --> 02:12:32.085]  We go to Drudge.
[02:12:32.085 --> 02:12:33.347]  We go to Breitbart.
[02:12:33.347 --> 02:12:35.909]  That's where we got to go now to get our information.
[02:12:35.909 --> 02:12:46.017]  So... Is it surprising to you that it came out, FBI agents and others have said they were blocked from investigating this couple and that mosque, and actually had the Civil Rights Commission from the White House sent down to stop them?
[02:12:47.659 --> 02:12:48.420]  Ridiculous.
[02:12:48.420 --> 02:12:52.863]  And then now it came out confirmed that the White House ordered the FBI to say this wasn't terrorism.
[02:12:52.863 --> 02:12:57.187]  Yeah, I watched it kind of unfold.
[02:12:57.187 --> 02:13:03.093]  Interestingly enough, the day Donald was on your show, I'm fixated on watching Donald Trump on your show.
[02:13:03.093 --> 02:13:06.436]  And then two hours later, this thing happens.
[02:13:06.436 --> 02:13:08.878]  I'm watching it unfold and slowly but surely,
[02:13:09.498 --> 02:13:22.263]  I'd watch Fox, I'd watch CNN, but everything from Fox, they'd say his name was a Muslim name, and then two hours later, CNN would have to, ugh, they were Muslims.
[02:13:22.263 --> 02:13:23.684]  But it wasn't terror?
[02:13:23.684 --> 02:13:25.804]  No, no, gosh no, it wasn't terror.
[02:13:25.804 --> 02:13:26.745]  Not at all.
[02:13:26.745 --> 02:13:32.127]  I mean, vest, bombs, going to Pakistan, and it turns out the government knew, order the FBI to stand down.
[02:13:33.407 --> 02:13:37.789]  To me, how about them letting the media in the apartment?
[02:13:37.789 --> 02:13:40.090]  Two days later, cameras inside the apartment.
[02:13:40.090 --> 02:13:40.790]  That's a crime scene.
[02:13:40.790 --> 02:13:42.110]  The bed hadn't even been turned.
[02:13:42.110 --> 02:13:42.590]  No.
[02:13:42.590 --> 02:13:44.071]  The walls hadn't been torn out.
[02:13:44.071 --> 02:13:48.873]  Normally in a real attack like this, if they didn't want to get rid of the crime scene, it'd be closed for months.
[02:13:48.873 --> 02:13:50.293]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:13:50.293 --> 02:13:51.033]  Absolutely.
[02:13:51.033 --> 02:13:53.194]  And that's why I need Gary here for this.
[02:13:53.194 --> 02:13:54.675]  Let's talk about the guy.
[02:13:55.595 --> 02:13:55.875]  Absolutely.
[02:13:55.875 --> 02:13:57.237]  Let's get into the film.
[02:13:57.237 --> 02:13:58.338]  Let's talk about Amara Gedmer.
[02:13:58.338 --> 02:14:01.701]  We're going to be playing the trailer coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[02:14:01.701 --> 02:14:04.384]  The trailer is now at Infowars.com.
[02:14:04.384 --> 02:14:07.467]  And let's talk about people like Gary taking action to make this film.
[02:14:07.964 --> 02:14:13.308]  You know, Gary and Diane Haven, to me, are amazing people.
[02:14:13.308 --> 02:14:31.561]  Here's a guy that has created a successful company, a successful business, has all the money in the world, could do whatever he wants, and what he has decided to do is he's going to stand up, he's going to put his money up, and he's going to create content, create films that is to expose the elites of the world.
[02:14:31.561 --> 02:14:32.662]  This is just the beginning.
[02:14:32.662 --> 02:14:34.263]  You're ready to announce this.
[02:14:34.263 --> 02:14:34.724]  This is it?
[02:14:35.464 --> 02:14:37.326]  Alright, well go ahead and tell folks about it.
[02:14:37.326 --> 02:14:45.573]  We're launching the Facebook for the first time, the website, the trailer, amerageddonthemovie.com, links at infowars.com, Facebook, Twitter.
[02:14:45.573 --> 02:14:47.514]  Will this film save the world by itself?
[02:14:47.514 --> 02:14:48.075]  No.
[02:14:48.075 --> 02:14:49.356]  Will this show do it by itself?
[02:14:49.356 --> 02:14:49.776]  No.
[02:14:49.776 --> 02:14:51.037]  Will Mike Norris by himself?
[02:14:51.037 --> 02:14:51.217]  No.
[02:14:51.217 --> 02:14:52.919]  Or Chuck Norris at WorldNetDaily?
[02:14:52.919 --> 02:14:53.379]  No.
[02:14:53.379 --> 02:15:00.385]  But all of us together, standing up to the New World Order, standing up to what's happening, the truth will expose what they're doing.
[02:15:00.385 --> 02:15:03.388]  And so it's very important that you make this film a hit.
[02:15:04.232 --> 02:15:06.293]  It's very entertaining, but very informative.
[02:15:06.293 --> 02:15:08.575]  It's very important that when it comes out in theaters, you see it.
[02:15:08.575 --> 02:15:10.756]  When it's on demand, you watch it.
[02:15:10.756 --> 02:15:13.518]  That when it then hits DVD, Blu-ray, you get it.
[02:15:13.518 --> 02:15:19.762]  Because we're building on alternative media, and when you come, that's actually what helps us build it bigger.
[02:15:19.762 --> 02:15:20.922]  It's kind of like fill the dreams.
[02:15:20.922 --> 02:15:22.043]  Build it, they will come.
[02:15:22.043 --> 02:15:23.604]  Build something, they will come.
[02:15:23.604 --> 02:15:26.706]  But then you start supporting, it gets bigger and bigger.
[02:15:26.706 --> 02:15:28.687]  And that's what the system is afraid of.
[02:15:28.687 --> 02:15:33.270]  We got those documents from the Clinton Foundation 20 years ago, saying we've got to shut down this internet.
[02:15:33.590 --> 02:15:37.231]  What happens if Christians and Libertarians and Conservatives use it?
[02:15:37.231 --> 02:15:38.691]  That'll be it for us!
[02:15:38.691 --> 02:15:46.614]  So the talking point was, call them conspiracy theorists, call them racist, stick the IRS on them, and 20 years later, what do we see them doing?
[02:15:46.614 --> 02:15:47.714]  Exactly that.
[02:15:47.714 --> 02:15:48.514]  Exactly that.
[02:15:48.514 --> 02:15:51.615]  Getting back to the film, your dad warned you too, didn't he?
[02:15:51.615 --> 02:15:52.515]  Yeah, he did.
[02:15:52.515 --> 02:15:55.816]  And he warned me again after he saw the film.
[02:15:55.816 --> 02:15:58.977]  He goes, just so you know, you are now on the list.
[02:16:00.733 --> 02:16:02.654]  What list?
[02:16:02.654 --> 02:16:04.274]  The hit list.
[02:16:04.274 --> 02:16:05.234]  And you know what?
[02:16:05.234 --> 02:16:07.715]  I wear that badge with honor.
[02:16:07.715 --> 02:16:11.096]  Because if I'm doing... And he was saying that in a good way to you.
[02:16:11.096 --> 02:16:12.436]  In a good way.
[02:16:12.436 --> 02:16:16.337]  Hey, I don't want to die for this movie.
[02:16:16.337 --> 02:16:17.297]  And I'm not putting words in your mouth.
[02:16:17.297 --> 02:16:19.358]  He told me at the time he said he was proud of you.
[02:16:19.358 --> 02:16:20.158]  Absolutely.
[02:16:20.158 --> 02:16:20.638]  Absolutely.
[02:16:20.638 --> 02:16:21.998]  He loved the movie.
[02:16:21.998 --> 02:16:23.699]  We have his full support on the film.
[02:16:23.699 --> 02:16:27.600]  So that's a huge blessing to us.
[02:16:28.991 --> 02:16:30.752]  But today is a big day.
[02:16:30.752 --> 02:16:34.475]  I mean, this is a movie we've been working on for a year and a half.
[02:16:34.475 --> 02:16:42.220]  It's a concept of Gary Havens, who I wish he could be here right now, but he is taking care of business somewhere in the world.
[02:16:42.220 --> 02:16:42.740]  I don't know.
[02:16:42.740 --> 02:16:45.683]  I'll find out next week when I see him.
[02:16:45.683 --> 02:16:46.983]  But this was his brainchild.
[02:16:46.983 --> 02:16:48.564]  He's like a James Bond character himself.
[02:16:48.564 --> 02:16:49.705]  He really is.
[02:16:49.705 --> 02:16:51.507]  He is so fascinating.
[02:16:52.427 --> 02:16:57.772]  So knowledgeable, and you know, it's kind of like talking to you, you just kind of get sucked in.
[02:16:57.772 --> 02:17:01.055]  He's more interesting than I am.
[02:17:01.055 --> 02:17:03.537]  And he's so knowledgeable, and he's so passionate.
[02:17:03.537 --> 02:17:07.360]  And like I said, here's a guy that could have done whatever he wants.
[02:17:07.360 --> 02:17:12.865]  He could go to his island, he could go to Australia, he's got property everywhere, very well set up.
[02:17:12.865 --> 02:17:14.167]  But this is what he decided
[02:17:15.287 --> 02:17:16.287]  This is important to him.
[02:17:35.595 --> 02:17:36.436]  All of them, basically.
[02:17:36.436 --> 02:17:37.816]  Pretty much all of them.
[02:17:37.816 --> 02:17:42.799]  And, um, you know, those are, those are his, his... Inside baseballs, yeah.
[02:17:42.799 --> 02:17:48.043]  That I wasn't part of, so I don't know exactly what was... Well, he was just telling me that a lot of people are awake now.
[02:17:48.043 --> 02:17:48.303]  Yeah.
[02:17:48.303 --> 02:17:50.624]  Which, which I pick up on as well, talking to folks.
[02:17:50.624 --> 02:17:51.925]  Yeah, slowly but surely.
[02:17:51.925 --> 02:17:53.966]  You know, slowly but surely.
[02:17:53.966 --> 02:17:59.750]  And that's why this film, Amerageddon, is so important, because, you know, we, we get our information in different ways.
[02:17:59.750 --> 02:18:01.871]  Um, you know, I enjoy your show every day.
[02:18:01.871 --> 02:18:04.673]  Um, I enjoy movies, uh, that...
[02:18:05.593 --> 02:18:07.054]  You know, I enjoy a lot of movies.
[02:18:07.054 --> 02:18:19.864]  Now, one thing that's interesting is Hollywood puts out these kind of movies, but what they do is they disguise it in animation and they just kind of hit the fringe of what's really happening.
[02:18:19.864 --> 02:18:21.365]  It's almost like they're wanting us to...
[02:18:23.387 --> 02:18:24.988]  That's a question I had for you.
[02:18:24.988 --> 02:18:27.469]  Ten years ago, you'd see no anti-New World Order stuff.
[02:18:27.469 --> 02:18:36.895]  Now, Superman, the new Captain America, so many of these plots are false flags, corrupt groups.
[02:18:36.895 --> 02:18:38.496]  Folks say it's like my show.
[02:18:38.496 --> 02:18:39.636]  What do you think that's about?
[02:18:39.636 --> 02:18:41.537]  No, I think you're 100% right.
[02:18:41.537 --> 02:18:48.862]  I think what they're trying to do is dumb us down, desensitize us to what's really happening, so when it does take place, it's like,
[02:18:49.622 --> 02:18:50.583]  Okay, well it's here.
[02:18:50.583 --> 02:18:51.984]  We kind of saw it coming.
[02:18:51.984 --> 02:18:53.805]  Well, I don't buy that.
[02:18:53.805 --> 02:18:55.086]  They're taking the edge off.
[02:18:55.086 --> 02:18:58.188]  They're taking the edge off, and a lot of people are buying it.
[02:18:58.188 --> 02:19:06.413]  What we're doing with Amerageddon is we've just ripped off all the shiny, pretty stuff that they put in their films, and we just tell the truth.
[02:19:06.413 --> 02:19:12.777]  We call out who we need to call out, and we tell a story within the confines of what's going on in the world.
[02:19:15.421 --> 02:19:16.923]  She gets a break.
[02:19:16.923 --> 02:19:24.014]  Yeah, really what it's about is us taking our freedom back from the government.
[02:19:24.014 --> 02:19:25.056]  That's what we need to do.
[02:19:25.056 --> 02:19:26.538]  The government is running our lives.
[02:19:26.538 --> 02:19:28.562]  We're taking our freedom back.
[02:19:29.696 --> 02:19:31.077]  And ideas are bulletproof.
[02:19:31.077 --> 02:19:32.598]  This is revolutionary.
[02:19:32.598 --> 02:19:48.507]  I've seen, no exaggeration, since I've been on air 20-something years, more than 30 or 40 made-for-TV shows, other films, where it's always a radio host in a bunker, leading a revolution against the government, blowing up schools full of children, and in a lot of the shows, he's even named Alex.
[02:19:48.507 --> 02:19:56.052]  Or it'll say, From Texas, Alex Johnson, and then I'm killing everyone, and that's just them attacking me and others.
[02:19:56.832 --> 02:20:03.114]  They've got shows where Green Lantern fights guys with tri-corner hats that want to put poison in the New York Bay.
[02:20:03.114 --> 02:20:09.697]  I mean, they just everywhere are demonizing patriots and going after us.
[02:20:09.697 --> 02:20:13.438]  So you're basically countering them, but not with hidden propaganda.
[02:20:13.438 --> 02:20:15.839]  You're just putting it right out there against them.
[02:20:15.839 --> 02:20:17.860]  Right out in your face.
[02:20:17.860 --> 02:20:25.183]  It is, like Gary likes to say, this is a true story that hasn't happened yet.
[02:20:25.183 --> 02:20:25.543]  But it will.
[02:20:26.283 --> 02:20:27.063]  But it will.
[02:20:27.063 --> 02:20:28.064]  Well, look at Europe.
[02:20:28.064 --> 02:20:42.492]  They've used the radical Islamic invasion they brought in, they advertised, to declare civil emergency and draconian martial law laws in Germany and France where they ban demonstrations of nationalist groups but then let the socialists run around the streets.
[02:20:42.492 --> 02:20:43.353]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:20:43.353 --> 02:20:50.037]  It was in full display of what was going on with the military in the streets and locking down the streets, martial law.
[02:20:50.037 --> 02:20:51.117]  It is coming.
[02:20:51.117 --> 02:20:52.078]  It's just a matter of time.
[02:20:53.243 --> 02:20:54.463]  Then they misrepresent.
[02:20:54.463 --> 02:20:57.924]  We come out and say, hey, here's this Jade Helm, army.milm.
[02:20:57.924 --> 02:21:00.025]  They say it's partisan takeover of hostile areas.
[02:21:00.025 --> 02:21:04.406]  We don't believe this is an imminent takeover, but it's more conditioning of our troops to accept this.
[02:21:04.406 --> 02:21:05.207]  They spin it.
[02:21:05.207 --> 02:21:06.427]  Alex Jones hates the military.
[02:21:06.427 --> 02:21:09.448]  He says they're coming to Texas this summer to kill everybody and take their guns.
[02:21:10.308 --> 02:21:13.349]  And then, since they put that out, people don't trust the government.
[02:21:13.349 --> 02:21:17.511]  They get scared from what hundreds of newspapers and TV stations said.
[02:21:17.511 --> 02:21:22.873]  They get scared by the media saying that and believe it's happening because my name's attached to it.
[02:21:22.873 --> 02:21:24.473]  And then they come out and say, see, it didn't happen.
[02:21:24.473 --> 02:21:25.553]  Alex Jones was a liar.
[02:21:25.553 --> 02:21:29.655]  And when I'm not talking about myself here, folks, you just need to know these are the tricks they engage in.
[02:21:29.955 --> 02:21:32.078]  Yeah, no, I agree with you.
[02:21:32.078 --> 02:21:35.723]  I agree with you 100% there.
[02:21:35.723 --> 02:21:40.650]  It's crazy the rabbit hole they're trying to push us down and I'm done.
[02:21:40.650 --> 02:21:44.135]  I was always kind of a quiet,
[02:21:46.738 --> 02:21:49.739]  You know, I didn't want to jump off the cliff 100%.
[02:21:49.739 --> 02:21:51.219]  I wanted to hold back a little bit.
[02:21:51.219 --> 02:21:52.300]  I had my views.
[02:21:52.300 --> 02:21:54.560]  I believe everything you're talking about.
[02:21:54.560 --> 02:21:56.541]  But I was just holding back.
[02:21:56.541 --> 02:22:00.322]  And it's not until now where we really need to make that choice.
[02:22:00.322 --> 02:22:01.942]  Are we in or are we out?
[02:22:01.942 --> 02:22:03.422]  Because you can't play in the middle.
[02:22:03.422 --> 02:22:05.343]  If you get played in the middle, you're dead.
[02:22:05.943 --> 02:22:10.145]  Never truer words have been spoken than what you just said, Mike Norris.
[02:22:10.145 --> 02:22:14.728]  I always think about the fact I've got to intensify what I'm doing, work even harder, or I've got to completely quit.
[02:22:14.728 --> 02:22:17.469]  I can't just back off halfway or back off 80%.
[02:22:17.469 --> 02:22:19.010]  And then it's a choice.
[02:22:19.010 --> 02:22:20.811]  I mean, I could take my children fishing and hunting more.
[02:22:20.811 --> 02:22:22.011]  I could be in better shape.
[02:22:22.011 --> 02:22:24.793]  Though I'm trying to get back in better shape, but I've just made the choice.
[02:22:24.793 --> 02:22:25.673]  I'm all in.
[02:22:25.673 --> 02:22:26.874]  I'm 100% committed.
[02:22:26.874 --> 02:22:27.334]  That's it.
[02:22:27.334 --> 02:22:27.674]  I'm done.
[02:22:27.674 --> 02:22:29.035]  I couldn't do it any other way.
[02:22:29.195 --> 02:22:31.036]  Yeah, no, I agree with you.
[02:22:31.036 --> 02:22:45.106]  And that's why it's so important on this film that we get the support, that we get the people to go to the Amerageddon Facebook page, the Amerageddon, the film website to really support us because this is it.
[02:22:45.106 --> 02:22:49.148]  We are going full in to create content that is going to expose
[02:22:50.109 --> 02:22:52.010]  What is happening behind the scenes?
[02:22:52.010 --> 02:22:53.770]  And there is a demonic elite.
[02:22:53.770 --> 02:22:56.711]  And I really believe it's a spiritual warfare.
[02:22:56.711 --> 02:23:00.832]  Behind it all, there is a spiritual warfare going on that is dictating what's happening.
[02:23:00.832 --> 02:23:03.273]  I want to talk more about that right now and then come back and play the trailer.
[02:23:03.273 --> 02:23:04.974]  We just skipped this network break.
[02:23:04.974 --> 02:23:06.494]  You're just announcing the trailer today.
[02:23:06.494 --> 02:23:07.634]  You're just launching it.
[02:23:07.634 --> 02:23:09.395]  The Facebook just got launched minutes ago.
[02:23:09.395 --> 02:23:10.895]  300 and something likes.
[02:23:10.895 --> 02:23:16.037]  I want to put at the top of our main Facebook that has a million followers and the others that have several million as well.
[02:23:16.037 --> 02:23:17.857]  Twitter, everywhere.
[02:23:17.857 --> 02:23:19.678]  But I want to ask listeners, you have the real power.
[02:23:19.958 --> 02:23:22.659]  When I get up here and push something, it reaches a few million people.
[02:23:22.659 --> 02:23:26.780]  If you don't decide to take action and carry that ball, it does nothing.
[02:23:26.780 --> 02:23:34.062]  I want to see 5 million views, 10 million views conservatively by next week on the Amerigeddon trailer.
[02:23:34.062 --> 02:23:39.184]  I want to see a couple hundred thousand likes per minimum on the Amerigeddon trailer.
[02:23:40.084 --> 02:23:49.770]  Facebook and on the website, because again, this is about creating patriot, anti-globalist markets for this type of material.
[02:23:49.770 --> 02:23:56.995]  And if this is even moderately successful, then they're going to commit to a flotilla of not just these films, but other films.
[02:23:56.995 --> 02:23:59.417]  We've been talking behind the scenes, a lot of stuff.
[02:23:59.417 --> 02:24:05.060]  This is about leaving Hollywood, leaving the censorship, and really putting your money where your mouth is.
[02:24:05.060 --> 02:24:08.983]  I mean, it's hard to have jets and helicopters and full... I mean, how big was this budget?
[02:24:10.763 --> 02:24:12.364]  Millions and millions of dollars.
[02:24:12.364 --> 02:24:14.986]  We're not going to say.
[02:24:14.986 --> 02:24:19.049]  Mr. Haven was very generous, but he is very smart.
[02:24:19.049 --> 02:24:23.632]  And so we had some guidelines, but I had everything I needed to make this film.
[02:24:24.514 --> 02:24:35.144]  Well, I mean, I've been on some pretty big films, and as a consultant but also in them, you know, fell into some link letter films you invited me to be in, and this was bigger crews and budgets, and it was pretty professional.
[02:24:35.144 --> 02:24:45.254]  Yeah, we had a great time, a great crew, you know, and it's interesting because a lot of the people that just came on to work on the film are getting really skittish right now.
[02:24:45.254 --> 02:24:48.577]  I've had phone calls, uh, could you change my name in the credits?
[02:24:49.218 --> 02:24:52.060]  By the way, because you guys have got a bunch of big actors and actresses, tell folks.
[02:24:52.060 --> 02:24:58.705]  Yeah, yeah, we've got Dina Meyer, Anna Lynn McCord, we have got the awesome Marshall Teague.
[02:24:58.705 --> 02:25:01.927]  Marshall Teague, to me, is one of the most brilliant actors.
[02:25:01.927 --> 02:25:05.850]  We've got this guy, he played a great part, Alex Jones.
[02:25:05.850 --> 02:25:07.892]  This is a movie!
[02:25:07.892 --> 02:25:10.434]  No, but what was awesome about that was we go,
[02:25:11.638 --> 02:25:13.100]  Can you play something different?
[02:25:13.100 --> 02:25:14.922]  We want you to play the bad guy.
[02:25:14.922 --> 02:25:16.865]  We want you to be the enemy.
[02:25:16.865 --> 02:25:18.948]  And you pulled it off with mastery.
[02:25:18.948 --> 02:25:21.031]  Oh, you're nice.
[02:25:21.031 --> 02:25:21.832]  It was certainly fun.
[02:25:23.823 --> 02:25:24.844]  I just would love to do it again.
[02:25:24.844 --> 02:25:32.090]  Now, let's get into the demonic nature of all of this with Mike Norris, the film, Amerageddon, amerageddonthemovie.com.
[02:25:32.090 --> 02:25:33.832]  Folks, put it on your Facebook, on your Twitter.
[02:25:33.832 --> 02:25:34.112]  Please.
[02:25:34.112 --> 02:25:36.114]  Send it out to your friends and family.
[02:25:36.114 --> 02:25:41.218]  These guys have really committed to do this, and you don't want to get a lot into it on the air, because it sounds like whining or complaining.
[02:25:41.218 --> 02:25:42.519]  It's a badge of courage.
[02:25:42.519 --> 02:25:44.281]  Before we get into the demonic stuff, which we'll do after the break,
[02:25:44.921 --> 02:25:46.142]  Talk about the censorship.
[02:25:46.142 --> 02:25:57.595]  I mean, people don't know that Homeland Security visited a major TV network that I was doing a show with and actually threatened them, and I'm not allowed to say what else happened, and it really makes me mad, but I was told in confidence, so I can't tell you.
[02:25:59.693 --> 02:26:00.654]  It was bad.
[02:26:00.654 --> 02:26:04.956]  And then, I mean, people don't know what goes on behind the scenes to shut stuff down.
[02:26:04.956 --> 02:26:07.678]  I've been thrown off XM, thrown off a bunch of affiliates.
[02:26:07.678 --> 02:26:14.323]  The stations get threatened, people coming off for money, I mean, hundreds of thousands of dollars just for a few months just to get me off.
[02:26:14.323 --> 02:26:14.543]  I mean,
[02:26:15.323 --> 02:26:18.925]  There is a real move in this country, so understand.
[02:26:18.925 --> 02:26:20.805]  That's why I have kinship with Donald Trump.
[02:26:20.805 --> 02:26:25.667]  I know what it's like, not at his level, to be surrounded by wolves, shoving their knives in you.
[02:26:25.667 --> 02:26:30.429]  You're in the arena, and all these people are up there in the stands, saying how he should do this, how he should do that.
[02:26:30.429 --> 02:26:30.850]  It doesn't matter.
[02:26:30.850 --> 02:26:31.890]  He's in the arena.
[02:26:31.890 --> 02:26:33.011]  It makes me respect him.
[02:26:33.011 --> 02:26:33.791]  You are in the arena.
[02:26:33.791 --> 02:26:36.332]  It's like your dad commended you for getting in it, but warns you.
[02:26:36.332 --> 02:26:36.952]  You're in the arena.
[02:26:36.952 --> 02:26:37.653]  Can you tell folks?
[02:26:37.653 --> 02:26:40.134]  I mean, you're not just saying, oh, this is being censored.
[02:26:40.134 --> 02:26:41.054]  Oh, they don't want it out.
[02:26:41.054 --> 02:26:42.374]  Oh, they won't distribute it.
[02:26:42.374 --> 02:26:43.015]  Blah, blah, blah.
[02:26:43.956 --> 02:26:46.598]  I mean, Mike Judge told me, everything he's done has been a hit.
[02:26:46.598 --> 02:26:47.899]  He's made billions of dollars.
[02:26:47.899 --> 02:26:50.541]  He told me, and I'm allowed to say it.
[02:26:50.541 --> 02:26:54.543]  When Fox saw Idiocracy, they said, this would be a hit.
[02:26:54.543 --> 02:26:57.265]  And by the way, they had a contract to make him make three movies.
[02:26:57.265 --> 02:26:58.246]  He was busy, he didn't want to do it.
[02:26:59.141 --> 02:27:01.762]  They said, we're not even going to list this or show this in theaters.
[02:27:01.762 --> 02:27:03.642]  Remember, it had all this hype, everybody wanted to see it.
[02:27:03.642 --> 02:27:06.783]  It's a huge hit in DVDs, made hundreds of millions of dollars.
[02:27:06.783 --> 02:27:12.064]  Now, they killed it because it showed how the public was being dumbed down and wasn't a message they wanted.
[02:27:12.064 --> 02:27:13.025]  That's how controlled it is.
[02:27:13.025 --> 02:27:14.405]  So I'm kind of ranting about it.
[02:27:14.405 --> 02:27:16.005]  I have hundreds of these stories.
[02:27:16.005 --> 02:27:22.227]  Folks don't understand that Mike Judge came on the show, gave his only political interview ever, and he said, I hope I don't get audited by the IRS for saying this.
[02:27:22.987 --> 02:27:28.149]  But they basically tell people in Hollywood, you keep your mouth shut or you'll never work again.
[02:27:28.149 --> 02:27:31.391]  And it doesn't matter if you've made three billion dollars like Mike Judge.
[02:27:31.391 --> 02:27:31.711]  Go ahead.
[02:27:31.711 --> 02:27:33.492]  Yeah, no, you're right.
[02:27:33.492 --> 02:27:34.572]  We're running in.
[02:27:34.572 --> 02:27:39.114]  We ran into that in Hollywood, sent out the screeners.
[02:27:39.114 --> 02:27:40.675]  Everybody goes, whoo, really good film.
[02:27:41.488 --> 02:27:47.554]  Not one person would touch it, even though every one of them said this thing is going to get a lot of support.
[02:27:47.554 --> 02:27:49.656]  Not one studio would touch it.
[02:27:49.656 --> 02:27:50.697]  So Gary said, you know what?
[02:27:50.697 --> 02:27:51.137]  Forget it.
[02:27:51.137 --> 02:27:52.679]  We'll do it ourselves.
[02:27:52.679 --> 02:27:59.706]  And so that's why we're going to open this film March 2nd in theaters in Texas on Texas Independence Day.
[02:27:59.706 --> 02:28:01.868]  And it's just so important that
[02:28:03.473 --> 02:28:03.953]  It's us.
[02:28:03.953 --> 02:28:04.534]  It's me.
[02:28:04.534 --> 02:28:06.755]  It's you that come out and support this film.
[02:28:06.755 --> 02:28:12.098]  I cannot emphasize that enough that all of us rally together.
[02:28:12.098 --> 02:28:17.180]  We become an army of one and we support this film and other films that will come out like it.
[02:28:17.180 --> 02:28:18.641]  Very important.
[02:28:18.641 --> 02:28:19.862]  We're on an island.
[02:28:19.862 --> 02:28:21.163]  We're fighting a war.
[02:28:21.163 --> 02:28:22.163]  We are fighting a war.
[02:28:22.163 --> 02:28:25.045]  So we got to stick together.
[02:28:25.045 --> 02:28:25.405]  Everyone.
[02:28:26.201 --> 02:28:29.743]  Absolutely, and look, you've got all these big TV shows, movies.
[02:28:29.743 --> 02:28:30.824]  You're not doing this for money.
[02:28:30.824 --> 02:28:31.925]  Remember, we talked behind the scenes.
[02:28:31.925 --> 02:28:37.348]  You've got more work than you could ever deal with, with all the TV shows you produce, not just Walker and the rest of it.
[02:28:37.348 --> 02:28:41.871]  I mean, you knew you would get further blackball for doing this, but it was almost just the challenge to do it.
[02:28:41.871 --> 02:28:45.073]  Now you've done it, and it's better than I thought it'd be with the budget.
[02:28:45.073 --> 02:28:48.396]  I mean, some parts of it look like beyond the Godfather they're so good.
[02:28:48.396 --> 02:28:50.917]  Other parts, you know, are fun, but better than TV.
[02:28:50.917 --> 02:28:52.518]  I mean, that's my real review of it.
[02:28:52.518 --> 02:28:53.859]  The content is five-star.
[02:28:55.060 --> 02:28:57.042]  I'm really honored to be involved in this.
[02:28:57.042 --> 02:28:58.543]  Yeah, I appreciate that.
[02:28:58.543 --> 02:29:06.109]  It was, you know, Gary just put in so much time and effort into every word that is in this film.
[02:29:06.109 --> 02:29:08.551]  We speak on the Second Amendment.
[02:29:08.551 --> 02:29:10.673]  We speak on the government coming to take our weapons.
[02:29:10.673 --> 02:29:12.174]  You lay out the whole blueprint.
[02:29:12.174 --> 02:29:13.035]  Everything.
[02:29:13.035 --> 02:29:13.976]  Everything.
[02:29:13.976 --> 02:29:19.821]  Before this all started, I was in the dark and I'm thinking, what on earth is Gary thinking here?
[02:29:20.683 --> 02:29:24.844]  But, the more I research it, then that's when I start figuring it out.
[02:29:24.844 --> 02:29:24.964]  Yeah.
[02:29:24.964 --> 02:29:25.204]  Holy crap.
[02:29:25.204 --> 02:29:26.145]  Well, that's what you said at first.
[02:29:26.145 --> 02:29:28.505]  You were kind of ambivalent, and by the time you were making it, you liked it.
[02:29:28.505 --> 02:29:29.366]  Now you love it.
[02:29:29.366 --> 02:29:29.986]  Love it.
[02:29:29.986 --> 02:29:30.366]  I'm in.
[02:29:30.366 --> 02:29:30.726]  I'm sold.
[02:29:30.726 --> 02:29:32.627]  High five, baby!
[02:29:32.627 --> 02:29:39.169]  When we come back with Mike Norris, there it is, the firstborn progeny of the great King Norris in front of us.
[02:29:39.169 --> 02:29:41.910]  I know your dad's probably listening and getting mad at me being goofy.
[02:29:41.910 --> 02:29:42.850]  That's what I do, though.
[02:29:42.850 --> 02:29:48.992]  We're going to be right back, ladies and gentlemen, to play the trailer and get into other world news with Mike Norris, the film, Amerageddon.
[02:29:49.372 --> 02:29:53.299]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.299 --> 02:29:55.984]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.276 --> 02:30:04.999]  Anti-gunners are planning a very pungent protest this weekend in Austin, Texas.
[02:30:04.999 --> 02:30:13.683]  In response to pro-CCL activists staging a mock mass shooting, counter-demonstrators will resort to waving dildos and mass farting.
[02:30:13.683 --> 02:30:18.386]  Yes, this is the self-defense equivalent of peeing yourself to stop a rape.
[02:30:18.386 --> 02:30:26.270]  With cardboard guns and fake blood, Come and Take It Texas and DontComply.com are pitching a life and liberty event to end gun-free zones.
[02:30:26.710 --> 02:30:34.135]  The active shooter drill will take place near the University of Texas this Saturday, but this time, the shooter picks the wrong crowd.
[02:30:34.135 --> 02:30:45.102]  The planned event comes at a particularly tense time in the nation's gun debate, and Texas colleges and universities are debating how to implement the state's new campus carry law that will start next fall.
[02:30:45.102 --> 02:30:52.627]  But gun control advocates say this event is offensive, and so they're staging a mass farting and dildo waving counter-protest.
[02:30:54.171 --> 02:30:55.732]  It's hot in your gender direction!
[02:30:55.732 --> 02:31:00.074]  Read more about this event at InfoWars.com.
[02:31:00.074 --> 02:31:07.277]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.

[02:32:02.812 --> 02:32:12.557]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[02:32:12.557 --> 02:32:15.258]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[02:32:15.258 --> 02:32:18.800]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[02:32:18.800 --> 02:32:25.123]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[02:32:25.123 --> 02:32:28.404]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on
[02:32:28.404 --> 02:32:28.644]  I'm good.
[02:32:44.378 --> 02:32:51.921]  Introducing ChildEase with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.

[02:33:17.552 --> 02:33:24.146]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:33:24.146 --> 02:33:25.549]  It's Alex Jones!
[02:33:31.877 --> 02:33:34.559]  The reason I'm here today is to encourage the U.S.
[02:33:34.559 --> 02:33:39.843]  Congress to take action to protect our country from its most imminent threat.
[02:33:39.843 --> 02:33:45.067]  Electricity would cease, the internet would go down, and the banking system.
[02:33:45.067 --> 02:33:49.211]  The smokescreen of national security used by government at every level.
[02:33:50.267 --> 02:33:53.108]  A strong America is the only thing standing in the way.
[02:33:53.108 --> 02:33:56.010]  The country only needs a little chaos.
[02:33:56.010 --> 02:34:00.812]  We have a fog that has descended on our entire nation.
[02:34:00.812 --> 02:34:02.753]  Hello, Mr. President.
[02:34:02.753 --> 02:34:05.214]  Now is the time.
[02:34:05.214 --> 02:34:08.356]  The average American family only has three days of food.
[02:34:08.356 --> 02:34:09.716]  We need to talk face-to-face.
[02:34:09.716 --> 02:34:10.637]  This is important.
[02:34:11.577 --> 02:34:12.457]  Sir, what's the mission?
[02:34:12.457 --> 02:34:14.778]  Disarm the population and restore order!
[02:34:14.778 --> 02:34:18.340]  Do you have any weapons inside your home on your person?
[02:34:18.340 --> 02:34:24.842]  You had to give the president power to arrest any American by simply accusing them of terrorism.
[02:34:24.842 --> 02:34:27.703]  The vanity of nationalism will quickly fade.
[02:34:27.703 --> 02:34:32.025]  These are but the birth pangs of a new world order.
[02:34:32.025 --> 02:34:35.266]  I'm just so afraid of the world that you're gonna have to grow up.
[02:34:35.266 --> 02:34:40.268]  This is a time, man, woman, young or old, when folks run and hide.
[02:34:41.241 --> 02:34:45.890]  Or they pull up their bootstraps and they fight.
[02:34:45.890 --> 02:34:50.899]  When you sell your soul to one time thing, there's no going back.
[02:34:54.668 --> 02:35:02.212]  Amerageddon, and it hits theaters coming up on March 2nd, Texas Independence Day, and we need to get around this Hollywood blockade.
[02:35:02.212 --> 02:35:11.696]  If it sells out the first few days in the theaters where it opens in Texas, that will then break the blockade, just like we did with America 2016 and the rest of it.
[02:35:11.696 --> 02:35:19.160]  And again, I wasn't making money off America 2016, but I helped promote it, helped push it, just as you did, to make sure it got around the censors and had a big effect.
[02:35:19.540 --> 02:35:21.381]  They of course arrested Dinesh D'Souza.
[02:35:21.381 --> 02:35:23.882]  Then we talk about the censorship and the stuff that goes on.
[02:35:23.882 --> 02:35:27.303]  They basically told him we're doing this because of your film and the next film that was coming out.
[02:35:27.303 --> 02:35:29.183]  They want to intimidate people.
[02:35:29.183 --> 02:35:30.384]  They want to shut people down.
[02:35:30.384 --> 02:35:41.048]  They sent him for psychological psychiatric evaluation for nine months after he was in prison over campaign issues and even the psychiatrists laughed and said this is all political persecution.
[02:35:41.048 --> 02:35:47.070]  So the good news is there's good people throughout the system that know this is a fraud but they don't want you to see
[02:35:48.280 --> 02:35:48.720]  I don't know.
[02:36:03.729 --> 02:36:05.170]  We're going to put it on Facebook, Twitter.
[02:36:05.170 --> 02:36:12.816]  It is very, very important that this film trailer go viral because it's about alternative media, alternative culture.
[02:36:12.816 --> 02:36:14.377]  America, an exclusive release.
[02:36:14.377 --> 02:36:16.759]  Powerful film exposes globalist takeover plan.
[02:36:16.759 --> 02:36:18.400]  We're going to retweet it over the weekend.
[02:36:18.400 --> 02:36:20.942]  Film exposes military training to confiscate guns.
[02:36:21.542 --> 02:36:23.804]  You can even put, you know, Norris.
[02:36:23.804 --> 02:36:26.386]  Norris directs film, exposing plan to confiscate guns.
[02:36:26.386 --> 02:36:30.250]  I know your dad's going to help out with World Net Daily and so much more.
[02:36:30.250 --> 02:36:34.093]  Again, to push a whole new genre, just like your dad did from the grassroots.
[02:36:34.093 --> 02:36:35.274]  I mean, explain that.
[02:36:35.274 --> 02:36:40.799]  Your dad with his films, grassroots to dominate Hollywood for over a decade, unprecedented what your dad did.
[02:36:40.799 --> 02:36:42.340]  You guys are getting ready to do it again with this.
[02:36:42.500 --> 02:36:47.605]  Yeah, no, we're gonna do the same thing he did back in the late 70s, early 80s.
[02:36:47.605 --> 02:36:54.150]  He'd make a movie, he'd take it to a theater called Four Walling, rent the theater, and have people come in and see it.
[02:36:54.150 --> 02:36:58.114]  And that's pretty much, I think, the same thing we're gonna do with this in Texas.
[02:36:58.114 --> 02:36:58.755]  I just think it's...
[02:37:00.238 --> 02:37:02.700]  I like it that I'm a Texan.
[02:37:02.700 --> 02:37:05.781]  I live in the greatest state we have in America.
[02:37:05.781 --> 02:37:08.162]  I believe Texas is the greatest state we have.
[02:37:08.162 --> 02:37:10.944]  It's the greatest country within America, I think.
[02:37:10.944 --> 02:37:14.366]  I used to always hear that growing up and roll my eyes.
[02:37:14.366 --> 02:37:21.009]  You don't listen to your parents and grandparents, but after I've been here and seen the difference in what old Texas was, absolutely it's great people.
[02:37:21.149 --> 02:37:22.831]  Yeah, and I'm from Los Angeles.
[02:37:22.831 --> 02:37:24.712]  I was born and raised in L.A.
[02:37:24.712 --> 02:37:26.534]  By the grace of God, I got out of there.
[02:37:26.534 --> 02:37:27.434]  I'm a full-blood Texan.
[02:37:27.434 --> 02:37:30.157]  But you were partially raised by Steve McQueen, so... Uh, he did.
[02:37:30.157 --> 02:37:31.438]  He taught me how to ride a motorcycle.
[02:37:31.438 --> 02:37:33.159]  Few things Trump didn't from Texas.
[02:37:33.159 --> 02:37:34.160]  Yeah, no.
[02:37:34.160 --> 02:37:36.682]  But your daddy's from Oklahoma, which used to be part of Texas.
[02:37:36.682 --> 02:37:37.283]  Did it really?
[02:37:37.283 --> 02:37:38.304]  Oh, yeah.
[02:37:38.304 --> 02:37:39.705]  I thought we were part of Mexico.
[02:37:39.705 --> 02:37:40.786]  You were that, too.
[02:37:40.786 --> 02:37:42.467]  Have you seen the original Texas Territory?
[02:37:42.467 --> 02:37:43.608]  Let's put it up on screen.
[02:37:43.608 --> 02:37:44.189]  Yeah, it was big.
[02:37:44.189 --> 02:37:45.570]  It went all the way up to Colorado.
[02:37:46.271 --> 02:37:48.497]  We don't learn that in school in California.
[02:37:48.497 --> 02:37:50.663]  We just learn about earthquakes.
[02:37:50.663 --> 02:37:51.485]  No.
[02:37:51.485 --> 02:37:53.410]  Folks, show them original Texas map.
[02:37:54.315 --> 02:37:56.137]  Yeah, it was almost as big as Louisiana Purchase.
[02:37:56.137 --> 02:37:57.418]  Wow, that's crazy.
[02:37:57.418 --> 02:37:59.380]  Yeah, but keep going, sorry.
[02:37:59.380 --> 02:38:01.482]  And that's what's really exciting.
[02:38:01.482 --> 02:38:02.263]  Oh, look at that.
[02:38:02.263 --> 02:38:03.264]  Part of Oklahoma.
[02:38:03.264 --> 02:38:04.506]  Yeah, sure is.
[02:38:04.506 --> 02:38:05.847]  Well, learn something every day.
[02:38:05.847 --> 02:38:07.889]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:38:07.889 --> 02:38:13.094]  But that's what's really exciting is we've got a starting point.
[02:38:13.094 --> 02:38:17.619]  We appreciate you guys so much at InfoWars, just how you've supported us, how you were
[02:38:17.659 --> 02:38:19.899]  David Knight's in the trailer.
[02:38:19.899 --> 02:38:22.780]  David Knight did an amazing job in the opening.
[02:38:22.780 --> 02:38:28.581]  It's a little opening we've got to just kind of give an overview of where we are in the world today.
[02:38:28.581 --> 02:38:32.322]  And that's where our story picks up with you and Gary going head-to-head.
[02:38:32.322 --> 02:38:35.043]  I wonder if we'll see David Knight in future films.
[02:38:35.043 --> 02:38:35.763]  Very possible.
[02:38:35.763 --> 02:38:39.083]  And the door sidekick Chuck Norris comes through.
[02:38:39.083 --> 02:38:41.164]  But our goal ultimately is
[02:38:42.734 --> 02:38:51.729]  Have this successful enough that the networks, that the TV networks can't deny us doing a television series called the American Diaries.
[02:38:53.323 --> 02:38:56.565]  Oh, you're dropping more bombshells on folks.
[02:38:56.565 --> 02:39:01.449]  But if people watch it, they have to show it.
[02:39:01.449 --> 02:39:02.749]  They have to show it.
[02:39:02.749 --> 02:39:05.251]  And you've done that a lot with TV shows, over and over again.
[02:39:05.251 --> 02:39:06.212]  Absolutely.
[02:39:06.212 --> 02:39:07.593]  It's not just Walker, Texas Ranger.
[02:39:07.593 --> 02:39:09.394]  You yourself have rolled out a bunch of big TV shows.
[02:39:09.394 --> 02:39:15.718]  Yeah, I've worked on, you know, my brother was the stunt coordinator, second year director on Chase, Prison Break.
[02:39:15.718 --> 02:39:20.922]  So I was able to go work on these shows, work on great films, Rush Hour films.
[02:39:20.922 --> 02:39:22.643]  So I've done a lot of stuff.
[02:39:23.163 --> 02:39:27.086]  The thing is, once I did Amerigeddon, that's it.
[02:39:27.086 --> 02:39:29.729]  I am now that guy doing those movies.
[02:39:29.729 --> 02:39:30.970]  And I'm all in.
[02:39:30.970 --> 02:39:32.071]  I'm all in.
[02:39:32.071 --> 02:39:34.933]  I sold my soul to God.
[02:39:34.933 --> 02:39:38.756]  I will tell a story about this just so folks get another example of the censorship.
[02:39:38.756 --> 02:39:39.417]  And I could care less.
[02:39:39.417 --> 02:39:40.878]  I love it.
[02:39:40.878 --> 02:39:44.922]  I knew back when I was on the set of Scanner Darkly, consulting for it, but also in it,
[02:39:46.479 --> 02:39:52.982]  With a great guy, Rick Linklater, who's a true liberal slash libertarian, classical liberal, not the modern fascist type.
[02:39:52.982 --> 02:39:56.143]  But he runs the Austin, Texas Film Societies and stuff like that.
[02:39:56.143 --> 02:40:00.625]  And Robert Rodriguez was out there at the old airport where they have a whole shooting facility.
[02:40:00.625 --> 02:40:02.946]  That was first when they opened that at the old airport.
[02:40:02.946 --> 02:40:09.269]  And some of my films have been given by one of the stunt directors to Rodriguez's wife at the time.
[02:40:10.029 --> 02:40:17.076]  And she liked the films, but she, you know, I basically was told, well, but Rodriguez doesn't like you, blah, blah, blah, and all this stuff, because he wants a low-income Keystone and all the rest of it.
[02:40:17.076 --> 02:40:21.581]  So he's kind of, in my view, in my opinion, like a white racist, but he's a Hispanic racist.
[02:40:21.581 --> 02:40:23.723]  And he's shown that with some of the stuff he's done.
[02:40:23.723 --> 02:40:27.186]  But, you know, regardless, I'm against all folks being based on race stuff.
[02:40:27.186 --> 02:40:29.328]  And he's a very talented director, so I'm not attacking him.
[02:40:30.208 --> 02:40:39.674]  Then, I was given the script of Machete, and I just said, here's this script, it's incredibly race-baiting, my gosh, and I knew it was being partially funded through the Democrats and others.
[02:40:39.674 --> 02:40:50.040]  I later confirmed from inside sources that he's met with Obama, with his channel, TV channel he's launched, it's meant for this whole, you know, a clash of civilizations garbage, George Soros funding Black Lives Matter.
[02:40:50.040 --> 02:40:56.584]  So, I'm for reforming the police problems, but I'm not for just overthrowing the government, you know, having some communist takeover, which your film kind of covers.
[02:40:56.584 --> 02:40:58.726]  Well, it doesn't kind of cover it, it does.
[02:41:00.094 --> 02:41:00.935]  Alex Jones is a liar.
[02:41:00.935 --> 02:41:01.675]  That is not the script.
[02:41:15.799 --> 02:41:20.661]  Perry already wanted to cut some of the film incentives in Texas because they were being selectively given.
[02:41:20.661 --> 02:41:22.761]  They wouldn't give them to conservative groups, libertarian groups.
[02:41:22.761 --> 02:41:28.463]  They wouldn't give them to a group that was making a film about Waco that was even a liberal group that was against it.
[02:41:28.463 --> 02:41:32.785]  And so I said it's wrong to not give the film incentives to everybody.
[02:41:32.785 --> 02:41:33.605]  You're making a film.
[02:41:34.906 --> 02:41:35.466]  We're good to go.
[02:41:57.523 --> 02:42:00.324]  We can't get somebody from Austin to change a lightbulb in here.
[02:42:00.324 --> 02:42:00.884]  Well, that was better.
[02:42:00.884 --> 02:42:02.524]  We were going to have locals build our set.
[02:42:02.524 --> 02:42:05.784]  We just hired the folks that built the Fox News studios out of New York.
[02:42:05.784 --> 02:42:06.805]  Oh, you heard us so bad.
[02:42:06.805 --> 02:42:08.625]  You know, we just hired folks from outside.
[02:42:08.625 --> 02:42:09.705]  I mean, big deal.
[02:42:09.705 --> 02:42:10.025]  Great.
[02:42:10.025 --> 02:42:11.705]  But then we hire folks out of Dallas.
[02:42:11.705 --> 02:42:16.566]  But I've had people as far away as Dallas working here and they go, I just got a call from Rodriguez.
[02:42:16.566 --> 02:42:18.147]  I'll never work again if I work with you.
[02:42:18.147 --> 02:42:19.407]  And that's how Hollywood works.
[02:42:19.407 --> 02:42:20.207]  Explain that to people.
[02:42:20.207 --> 02:42:23.027]  Yeah, no, that's exactly how it is.
[02:42:23.027 --> 02:42:26.168]  You know, people do get blackballed out of Hollywood.
[02:42:27.352 --> 02:42:30.074]  But I mean, down to the point where I can't even get crew in here.
[02:42:30.074 --> 02:42:32.496]  Yeah, I get it there.
[02:42:32.496 --> 02:42:33.196]  And you know what?
[02:42:33.196 --> 02:42:37.960]  They've got their hands inside the unions and everything.
[02:42:37.960 --> 02:42:40.422]  Well, show us how they're thugs trying to run what we do.
[02:42:40.422 --> 02:42:41.543]  I'm not in Hollywood.
[02:42:41.543 --> 02:42:43.064]  I've got a media operation.
[02:42:43.064 --> 02:42:44.325]  And that's just like us.
[02:42:44.325 --> 02:42:45.466]  That's just like us.
[02:42:45.466 --> 02:42:46.427]  We make movies.
[02:42:46.427 --> 02:42:49.309]  We make movies.
[02:42:49.309 --> 02:42:50.550]  Yeah, it's tough.
[02:42:50.550 --> 02:42:53.012]  And I don't know what's going on down in Austin with Rodriguez.
[02:42:54.068 --> 02:42:55.309]  I'm not trying to get you into that.
[02:42:55.309 --> 02:42:57.770]  I'm just showing you inside baseball that I've experienced.
[02:42:57.770 --> 02:43:03.872]  Talk about the type of stuff Hollywood does, the spiritual darkness you've talked about, why you say it's a satanic conspiracy.
[02:43:03.872 --> 02:43:11.496]  Because I agree, at the end of the day, these people do stuff in power that isn't even good for them and their families or their bottom line, but they have a mission.
[02:43:11.496 --> 02:43:13.657]  They're bound together by that mystery of evil.
[02:43:13.877 --> 02:43:21.221]  Yeah, I think the world, the whole world, and the elites are demonic.
[02:43:21.221 --> 02:43:22.101]  I really do.
[02:43:22.101 --> 02:43:28.685]  I believe they have sold their soul to the devil for power, for money, and they want chaos.
[02:43:28.685 --> 02:43:30.926]  They need chaos to take over.
[02:43:30.926 --> 02:43:36.609]  It says in the movie, you know, all America needs is a little chaos for us to take over.
[02:43:37.009 --> 02:43:43.514]  And it shows the UN and globalists, he's a Soros character, admittedly, creating the destabilization.
[02:43:43.514 --> 02:43:45.075]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:43:45.075 --> 02:43:46.616]  And it's happening.
[02:43:46.616 --> 02:43:48.598]  It's all happening right in front of us right now.
[02:43:48.598 --> 02:43:50.559]  All you got to do is turn on the TV.
[02:43:50.559 --> 02:43:51.260]  And I'm done.
[02:43:51.260 --> 02:43:54.262]  I'm done turning on the TV because all they're telling me is lies.
[02:43:54.262 --> 02:43:56.123]  So this is where I'm getting my information.
[02:43:56.123 --> 02:43:59.506]  I'm getting my information from you, from Drudge.
[02:43:59.506 --> 02:44:00.666]  That's where we need to
[02:44:02.108 --> 02:44:04.550]  People really need to go out and start studying.
[02:44:04.550 --> 02:44:09.856]  Well, I gotta say, Breitbart was always really good, but they just do break a lot of hardcore news.
[02:44:09.856 --> 02:44:11.437]  So does Daily Caller.
[02:44:11.437 --> 02:44:16.262]  I mean, they're really exposing, so is InfoWars, but people say, man, why do you promote your competition?
[02:44:16.262 --> 02:44:17.904]  It's not competition!
[02:44:17.904 --> 02:44:20.787]  I mean, we're gonna lose everything if we don't turn this around, folks.
[02:44:21.047 --> 02:44:22.969]  No, you're 100% right.
[02:44:22.969 --> 02:44:24.471]  And we're losing right now.
[02:44:24.471 --> 02:44:26.313]  But we will win!
[02:44:26.313 --> 02:44:27.073]  We are going to win this.
[02:44:27.073 --> 02:44:28.194]  World Net Daily is excellent.
[02:44:28.194 --> 02:44:29.736]  Yeah, World Net Daily, yeah.
[02:44:29.736 --> 02:44:30.837]  But we're going to win.
[02:44:32.955 --> 02:44:37.580]  Man, what people got to understand, this is not, this isn't a joke.
[02:44:37.580 --> 02:44:39.042]  This is going to be horrible.
[02:44:39.042 --> 02:44:45.449]  The Supreme Court Justice, I can't name him, came to drudge and said, they're going to start trying to shut the media down next year.
[02:44:45.449 --> 02:44:47.731]  Yeah, and it's going to be horrible.
[02:44:47.731 --> 02:44:53.757]  And once they start trying to really take away our guns, that's when it's really going to fall apart.
[02:44:53.757 --> 02:44:54.578]  I'm not giving up mine.
[02:44:55.478 --> 02:44:59.681]  And they know that that will trigger the civil war, which is the ultimate false flag.
[02:44:59.681 --> 02:45:14.652]  Because if they've war-gamed it and know it'll start a war, it's unconstitutional, it'll cause higher crime, it's evil, and they go ahead and do it, just like they destabilized Syria or Ukraine, are the elites really going to let George Soros and Hillary Clinton and others and Obama really try to run that here?
[02:45:14.652 --> 02:45:18.435]  I mean, are you people... and look, we have General Flynn, all these other top generals coming out saying,
[02:45:18.775 --> 02:45:20.736]  Our government runs Al-Qaeda and ISIS.
[02:45:20.736 --> 02:45:21.617]  It's wrong.
[02:45:21.617 --> 02:45:22.737]  It was willful.
[02:45:22.737 --> 02:45:23.358]  It's evil.
[02:45:23.358 --> 02:45:24.718]  It needs to be investigated.
[02:45:24.718 --> 02:45:29.481]  That is almost Valkyrie-level World War II, the German military going after Hitler.
[02:45:29.481 --> 02:45:32.203]  That's one inch away from that next move.
[02:45:32.203 --> 02:45:39.287]  Oh, imagine a Chuck Norris movie with a $100 million budget with him as a colonel leading a command group, kicking a U.N.
[02:45:39.287 --> 02:45:42.169]  takeover army basically out of D.C.
[02:45:42.169 --> 02:45:43.509]  or something.
[02:45:43.509 --> 02:45:44.390]  That would be the movie.
[02:45:45.250 --> 02:45:46.531]  Oh yeah.
[02:45:46.531 --> 02:45:49.193]  That would be cool.
[02:45:49.193 --> 02:45:50.914]  But it really goes back.
[02:45:50.914 --> 02:45:53.575]  We are all in a fight and we're on our side.
[02:45:53.575 --> 02:45:55.216]  We're the good guys here.
[02:45:55.216 --> 02:45:58.298]  And your listeners and your viewers are the good guys.
[02:45:58.298 --> 02:45:59.239]  I agree.
[02:45:59.239 --> 02:46:00.019]  It's an epic fight.
[02:46:00.019 --> 02:46:03.921]  Who was the famous gray-haired guy that played in Westerns and other combat movies?
[02:46:03.921 --> 02:46:07.003]  The gray-haired guy that's like the commander in Delta Force and your dad's?
[02:46:09.616 --> 02:46:13.397]  Pull up IMDb, Delta Force, Delta Force One, Chuck Norris.
[02:46:13.397 --> 02:46:15.757]  The point is your dad can now- Lee Marvin.
[02:46:15.757 --> 02:46:16.257]  Lee Marvin.
[02:46:16.257 --> 02:46:22.758]  Your dad could now, he doesn't look as old as Lee Marvin did, but your dad has got to now play the Lee Marvin character in movies like this.
[02:46:22.758 --> 02:46:24.138]  Like Bring Back Snake Plissken.
[02:46:24.138 --> 02:46:25.359]  Yeah, there it is.
[02:46:25.359 --> 02:46:26.259]  Yeah, that's it.
[02:46:26.259 --> 02:46:29.559]  Chuck Norris, Lee Marvin, Delta Force.
[02:46:29.559 --> 02:46:29.899]  Yeah.
[02:46:29.899 --> 02:46:34.980]  I was with my dad at Thanksgiving and I gotta tell you, he looks great.
[02:46:34.980 --> 02:46:36.801]  I mean, he's- Look at that commie voting.
[02:46:36.801 --> 02:46:36.981]  5.5.
[02:46:36.981 --> 02:46:37.821]  It deserves 10 stars.
[02:46:39.588 --> 02:46:40.108]  That's Hollywood.
[02:46:40.108 --> 02:46:42.289]  I think I'm going to buy Delta Force.
[02:46:42.289 --> 02:46:45.410]  Man, that's a good movie.
[02:46:45.410 --> 02:46:48.831]  I love Road Warrior style films.
[02:46:48.831 --> 02:46:55.753]  After my dad did the first two Delta Forces, the film company, Canon, wanted to do... There's a little more life in this.
[02:46:55.753 --> 02:46:56.293]  Let's go do it.
[02:46:56.873 --> 02:46:57.774]  So, I got a phone call.
[02:46:57.774 --> 02:47:01.676]  Well, we want to make these Delta Force movies, but we don't want to spend that kind of money.
[02:47:01.676 --> 02:47:04.278]  So, in comes Mike Norris to do Delta Force 3 and 4.
[02:47:04.278 --> 02:47:05.579]  It was great.
[02:47:05.579 --> 02:47:06.219]  I had a great time.
[02:47:06.219 --> 02:47:06.819]  Let's pull that up.
[02:47:06.819 --> 02:47:08.701]  Let's pull up Mike Norris, Delta Force 3 and 4.
[02:47:08.701 --> 02:47:10.362]  Let's see you then.
[02:47:10.362 --> 02:47:13.283]  By the way, not only were you good buddies with your dad, of course, with
[02:47:14.384 --> 02:47:17.988]  Steve McQueen, who I guess introduced your dad into movies and the rest was history.
[02:47:17.988 --> 02:47:19.449]  But your dad was the real deal.
[02:47:19.449 --> 02:47:25.636]  I mean, I remember talking to Joe Rogan, who's an accomplished UFC guy and won some national stuff in Taekwondo as well.
[02:47:25.636 --> 02:47:28.699]  I was like, who's your idol?
[02:47:28.699 --> 02:47:29.780]  And he goes, well, I like Chuck Norris.
[02:47:30.040 --> 02:47:32.862]  And this is like, met him like 16, 17 years ago here in Austin.
[02:47:32.862 --> 02:47:34.324]  We've been good friends since then.
[02:47:34.324 --> 02:47:34.804]  And I said, why?
[02:47:34.804 --> 02:47:36.605]  And he goes, well, he's like the American deal.
[02:47:36.605 --> 02:47:39.348]  He goes, he won all those championships for real against guys a lot bigger.
[02:47:39.348 --> 02:47:40.428]  That was all real.
[02:47:40.428 --> 02:47:42.210]  He could continue to win over and over again.
[02:47:42.210 --> 02:47:46.734]  And he goes, man, you get hurt doing that just a couple of times because, you know, that was contact sport.
[02:47:46.734 --> 02:47:47.935]  Obviously, you know all about it.
[02:47:47.935 --> 02:47:52.618]  And the fact that then he could go on and start his own Hollywood thing from the grassroots.
[02:47:52.618 --> 02:47:57.983]  I mean, your dad was a Mavericks Maverick when the stuff he's done, and he's still a Mavericks Maverick with what he's going to do in the future.
[02:47:57.983 --> 02:47:59.204]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:47:59.744 --> 02:48:10.273]  You know, it's really a blessing to really have a father that, first off, he loved us.
[02:48:10.273 --> 02:48:12.495]  I forgot, Joe, just interrupt because I'm so horrible.
[02:48:12.495 --> 02:48:18.721]  Yeah, I forgot, Joe said he thought your dad would have been a UFC champion if he'd have been, you know, at that age now when that was going on.
[02:48:18.721 --> 02:48:19.261]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:48:20.382 --> 02:48:21.322]  It could have been.
[02:48:21.322 --> 02:48:24.484]  My dad was smarter than any other fighter out there.
[02:48:24.484 --> 02:48:25.905]  He was not the most physical.
[02:48:25.905 --> 02:48:28.226]  He was not the fastest, meanest, anything.
[02:48:28.226 --> 02:48:29.626]  But he was the smartest.
[02:48:29.626 --> 02:48:32.067]  And if he ever did get beat, it only happened once.
[02:48:32.067 --> 02:48:34.929]  Because he would learn his lesson, come back, and beat that opponent.
[02:48:34.929 --> 02:48:36.349]  Sure, but you said your dad loved you uninterrupted.
[02:48:36.349 --> 02:48:37.550]  Yeah, no, you know what?
[02:48:38.897 --> 02:48:44.581]  My dad, during high school, he wouldn't make movies during football season.
[02:48:44.581 --> 02:48:48.725]  He'd come to every football game, every Friday night light.
[02:48:48.725 --> 02:48:53.448]  So he scheduled his life around his kids.
[02:48:53.448 --> 02:49:01.634]  And I hope he still sees it like that, because he's got two younger kids now with Gina, and they're 14, 15 years old.
[02:49:04.897 --> 02:49:08.418]  It's important that my dad knows that this isn't his second chance.
[02:49:08.418 --> 02:49:12.581]  He did great the first time, and he's going to do great again with his new kids.
[02:49:12.581 --> 02:49:21.406]  But it was so special to be able to see his fame get a little higher, and he'd still show up at all the football games.
[02:49:21.406 --> 02:49:24.928]  I'd run up and give him a kiss after every game, him and my mother.
[02:49:24.928 --> 02:49:27.449]  So it was all very normal.
[02:49:27.449 --> 02:49:28.430]  It was all very normal.
[02:49:28.430 --> 02:49:30.271]  Chuck Norris is pure Americana.
[02:49:30.271 --> 02:49:31.151]  Absolutely.
[02:49:31.151 --> 02:49:31.711]  Absolutely.
[02:49:33.172 --> 02:49:35.292]  100%.
[02:49:35.292 --> 02:49:36.653]  Well, it's amazing.
[02:49:36.653 --> 02:49:38.333]  The film is Amerageddon.
[02:49:38.333 --> 02:49:40.734]  You guys are 100% Americana.
[02:49:40.734 --> 02:49:47.115]  I just want to congratulate you and Gary Haven and everybody else because this is better than I thought it'd be.
[02:49:47.115 --> 02:49:48.915]  I mean, it really is good.
[02:49:48.915 --> 02:49:50.976]  I got a chance to see the film last week.
[02:49:50.976 --> 02:49:55.877]  I hope we can come back down before the film opens in March to bring Gary down here.
[02:49:55.877 --> 02:49:56.337]  Like I said,
[02:49:57.037 --> 02:50:11.807]  Gary, the man of mystery, is off doing something mysterious, but he is very passionate, very well-read on everything going on, and where I'm always trying to play catch-up with him.
[02:50:11.807 --> 02:50:13.008]  So, I'm excited.
[02:50:13.008 --> 02:50:18.832]  I just really encourage everybody to go to the American Facebook page, American the Film website.
[02:50:18.832 --> 02:50:19.952]  You know what's weird?
[02:50:19.952 --> 02:50:23.495]  You just launched today, it was like 100, 500, 800, just went back down to 400.
[02:50:23.495 --> 02:50:24.996]  I've never seen Facebook do that.
[02:50:24.996 --> 02:50:26.177]  The likes just went down on it.
[02:50:26.960 --> 02:50:28.021]  I wonder if they're jacking with that.
[02:50:28.021 --> 02:50:32.544]  I mean, they... I mean, it certainly censors sometimes, so it's going up and down.
[02:50:32.544 --> 02:50:34.546]  We need this to have hundreds of thousands by next week.
[02:50:34.546 --> 02:50:35.747]  I know the trailer will.
[02:50:35.747 --> 02:50:39.150]  Exclusively at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:50:39.150 --> 02:50:40.391]  See the trailer!

[02:50:43.493 --> 02:50:44.354]  That's a great job.
[02:50:44.354 --> 02:50:44.954]  Mike, come back.
[02:50:44.954 --> 02:50:46.496]  I've got a few other questions for you.
[02:50:46.496 --> 02:50:53.022]  And then we're going to hand the baton to David Knight, who is actually in the trailer promoting the film.
[02:50:53.022 --> 02:50:54.063]  He's kind of like the narrator.
[02:50:54.063 --> 02:50:59.087]  Just like in Blade Runner, they've got the old cop talking about, well, what was happening at that time.
[02:51:00.348 --> 02:51:02.969]  Ho, ho, ho.
[02:51:02.969 --> 02:51:05.449]  Katie is ready for the holiday season.

[02:52:29.338 --> 02:52:32.380]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[02:52:32.380 --> 02:52:35.022]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[02:52:35.022 --> 02:52:35.762]  Croix River.
[02:52:35.762 --> 02:52:38.004]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[02:52:38.004 --> 02:52:40.966]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[02:52:40.966 --> 02:52:41.826]  His excuse?
[02:52:41.826 --> 02:52:43.167]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[02:52:43.167 --> 02:52:44.788]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[02:52:44.788 --> 02:52:50.532]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.

[02:54:10.505 --> 02:54:15.287]  Speaking of Mission Impossible, we're doing five minutes to the next hour, then handing the baton to David Knight.
[02:54:15.287 --> 02:54:17.869]  I'll be back this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:54:17.869 --> 02:54:20.571]  I'll be hosting the Sunday transmission live.
[02:54:20.571 --> 02:54:23.493]  And then right into next week, right into 2016.
[02:54:23.493 --> 02:54:25.434]  This is not a setup.
[02:54:25.434 --> 02:54:31.638]  I said, hey, we're gonna come back to this segment, do five more minutes to the next hour, and then no man's land, and then, you know, hand it over to David Knight.
[02:54:32.358 --> 02:54:32.799]  We're good to go.
[02:54:49.775 --> 02:54:50.996]  Well, you know what?
[02:54:50.996 --> 02:54:55.722]  I have lost 50 pounds using these supplements from Alex and Info.
[02:54:55.722 --> 02:54:56.582]  But you were never fat.
[02:54:56.582 --> 02:54:58.565]  I don't know what happened to you.
[02:54:58.565 --> 02:55:00.707]  I was 232 when we did the film.
[02:55:00.707 --> 02:55:02.969]  I was 232 pounds.
[02:55:02.969 --> 02:55:04.331]  I was a horrible mess.
[02:55:04.331 --> 02:55:05.632]  Well, you're in fighting weight right now.
[02:55:05.632 --> 02:55:06.233]  Really?
[02:55:06.233 --> 02:55:06.633]  You really?
[02:55:06.633 --> 02:55:07.034]  The products?
[02:55:07.034 --> 02:55:07.815]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:55:07.815 --> 02:55:09.557]  You gave me a whole box of these.
[02:55:09.557 --> 02:55:09.697]  Hey.
[02:55:11.181 --> 02:55:12.362]  Male vitality?
[02:55:12.362 --> 02:55:13.483]  Where's my camera?
[02:55:13.483 --> 02:55:14.725]  Get it.
[02:55:14.725 --> 02:55:15.686]  Brain?
[02:55:15.686 --> 02:55:16.406]  The brain?
[02:55:16.406 --> 02:55:19.970]  I'm telling you, everybody, this stuff is amazing.
[02:55:19.970 --> 02:55:20.451]  I use it.
[02:55:20.451 --> 02:55:22.152]  I've lost 50 pounds.
[02:55:22.152 --> 02:55:22.993]  I feel great.
[02:55:22.993 --> 02:55:25.376]  I feel better than I've ever felt in my life.
[02:55:25.376 --> 02:55:26.957]  This is not a joke.
[02:55:26.957 --> 02:55:28.619]  Please support this.
[02:55:28.619 --> 02:55:29.580]  It's awesome.
[02:55:29.580 --> 02:55:30.121]  Well, thank you.
[02:55:30.121 --> 02:55:31.602]  I mean, I went to the top chemist.
[02:55:33.484 --> 02:55:39.926]  Two of the biggest non-GMO laboratories in the country that are like, you know, they make most of the stuff from whole foods, you name it.
[02:55:39.926 --> 02:55:46.749]  And I said, what would your scientists want to be just over the top if people really wanted to have, you know, half the cost of the bottle be the product?
[02:55:46.749 --> 02:55:49.109]  Then we would do this, we would do that, we would do this, we would do that.
[02:55:49.109 --> 02:55:50.810]  And Group makes most of my products as well.
[02:55:50.810 --> 02:55:53.171]  That's what kind of, you know, sets up the whole vetting process.
[02:55:54.071 --> 02:55:57.953]  And, you know, we'll have a product that's $40 and $20 of it's the product.
[02:55:57.953 --> 02:55:59.233]  Let's tell a big markup.
[02:55:59.233 --> 02:56:01.494]  The average markup of supplements is seven times.
[02:56:01.494 --> 02:56:04.015]  They will not put the quality in it.
[02:56:04.015 --> 02:56:08.017]  And that's why this stuff, I mean, I want stuff that will knock your socks off.
[02:56:08.017 --> 02:56:11.679]  And I'm telling you, Infowarslife.com, Supermail isn't a game though.
[02:56:11.679 --> 02:56:12.299]  I know people that like...
[02:56:12.819 --> 02:56:13.219]  I feel really good.
[02:56:13.219 --> 02:56:13.639]  My wife's very happy.
[02:56:39.986 --> 02:56:40.527]  Sorry, honey.
[02:56:40.527 --> 02:56:46.594]  I got a high-powered lawyer who one of his best friends is like a top herbologist and he just wanted to see if I was full of baloney.
[02:56:46.594 --> 02:56:47.275]  I've known him for years.
[02:56:47.275 --> 02:56:49.518]  He brought him to me and went, man, this is really great stuff.
[02:56:49.518 --> 02:56:51.921]  Oh, Dr. Gribson-Volvo, that's like the best guy.
[02:56:51.921 --> 02:56:57.708]  Well, you know, everybody's now getting testosterone shots, having to take this or that right here.
[02:56:57.708 --> 02:56:58.009]  One stop.
[02:56:59.949 --> 02:57:03.011]  It's the real deal, and it's from Mother Nature, the good old Lord above.
[02:57:03.011 --> 02:57:04.612]  All right, we're going to break here.
[02:57:04.612 --> 02:57:09.936]  You've been talking about Trump, and so if you want to repeat any of that on air, I mean, what do you think about Trump?
[02:57:09.936 --> 02:57:11.077]  What's Papa think about him?
[02:57:11.077 --> 02:57:12.978]  Okay.
[02:57:12.978 --> 02:57:17.261]  You know, my dad loves Trump.
[02:57:17.261 --> 02:57:19.883]  There may be some issues with facial expressions.
[02:57:19.883 --> 02:57:20.283]  I don't know.
[02:57:22.725 --> 02:57:31.322]  Look, there's nothing wrong with the American people wanting our leader to make us feel better, make us feel safe.
[02:57:31.322 --> 02:57:34.348]  I'm safe, you're safe, your listeners...
[02:57:35.808 --> 02:57:39.511]  I'm sure probably pretty safe because they're armed, they're ready.
[02:57:39.511 --> 02:57:46.317]  But the average Joe wants a leader that's going to make them feel secure living in this country.
[02:57:46.317 --> 02:57:47.679]  It's like Ronald Reagan.
[02:57:47.679 --> 02:57:49.240]  It's like Ronald Reagan in 1981.
[02:57:49.240 --> 02:57:53.044]  I remember it was the first time I ever got to vote for president.
[02:57:53.044 --> 02:57:55.166]  I was in high school and I voted for Ronald Reagan.
[02:57:55.166 --> 02:57:56.027]  I remember this.
[02:57:56.027 --> 02:57:57.988]  Jimmy Carter, we had hostages in Iran.
[02:57:58.909 --> 02:58:00.710]  Well, that's what we need.
[02:58:21.832 --> 02:58:29.596]  A national symbol, or somebody to tell us that we can be great again, and to get past this socialist idea that we're all pathetic, cloward and pivot.
[02:58:29.596 --> 02:58:31.117]  They don't want us to feel great again.
[02:58:31.117 --> 02:58:31.777]  Women feel great.
[02:58:31.777 --> 02:58:32.618]  Men feel great.
[02:58:32.618 --> 02:58:33.078]  Stay there.
[02:58:33.078 --> 02:58:37.460]  Another segment with Mike Norris, 70 seconds away on the fourth hour.
[02:58:37.460 --> 02:58:39.421]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:58:39.421 --> 02:58:41.342]  Amerageddonthemovie.com.
[02:58:41.342 --> 02:58:46.465]  If you don't send that link out and watch that video, all I can say is, you're helping the globalists.
[02:58:46.465 --> 02:58:47.946]  I mean, seriously, folks.
[02:58:47.946 --> 02:58:48.606]  We love you.
[02:58:48.606 --> 02:58:49.187]  And we know you will.
[02:58:50.027 --> 02:58:53.228]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[02:58:53.228 --> 02:58:55.568]  Deep Cleanze by InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:58:55.568 --> 02:59:02.590]  A scientifically formulated blend of nanocolloidal zeolites and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.

[02:59:26.202 --> 02:59:33.309]  Look, there's a reason Deep Cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary Spike Georex herbal processing technique.

[02:59:38.795 --> 02:59:39.975]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:08.994 --> 03:00:13.836]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:13.836 --> 03:00:18.717]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:33.217 --> 03:00:35.578]  Look at this new story from m4wars.com.
[03:00:35.578 --> 03:00:43.820]  A transgender father who abandoned his seven children to start a new life as a six-year-old girl is being celebrated by some liberals as a shining example of diversity.
[03:00:43.820 --> 03:00:47.401]  So is the woman that poured Drano in her eyes and makes taxpayers pay for her life.
[03:00:47.401 --> 03:00:52.603]  I mean, what do you think's behind all this, Mr. Norris?
[03:00:52.603 --> 03:00:55.344]  Wow.
[03:00:55.344 --> 03:00:55.744]  You know what?
[03:00:57.898 --> 03:00:58.779]  Could it be the food?
[03:00:58.779 --> 03:00:59.419]  I don't know.
[03:00:59.419 --> 03:01:01.420]  I really don't know.
[03:01:01.420 --> 03:01:08.665]  What is causing people... Alex, I really don't even have an answer.
[03:01:08.665 --> 03:01:13.008]  I mean, it looks like a 300 pound guy would run a diner in New Jersey.
[03:01:15.178 --> 03:01:18.100]  Like Alice, I guess.
[03:01:18.100 --> 03:01:19.400]  We're in a sick world.
[03:01:19.400 --> 03:01:22.542]  It's a sick world we're living in.
[03:01:22.542 --> 03:01:30.185]  Fortunately, there's a lot of people that know the truth and that are going to stand up against us.
[03:01:30.185 --> 03:01:35.268]  But our Congress and our Supreme Court, they're just going to let this go?
[03:01:35.828 --> 03:01:36.971]  You were talking about Trump.
[03:01:36.971 --> 03:01:38.253]  Finish up on that in the time we have.
[03:01:38.253 --> 03:01:41.199]  And then also you want to talk about the President's address on Sunday.
[03:01:47.625 --> 03:01:49.287]  You know, I'm safe.
[03:01:49.287 --> 03:01:51.108]  I've got my family protected.
[03:01:51.108 --> 03:01:59.596]  But as a country, it's nice that when we see our leader, our president, come up and make us feel we're badass.
[03:01:59.596 --> 03:02:01.758]  We are a badass country.
[03:02:01.758 --> 03:02:09.906]  The other night when Obama came on for the State of the Union or whatever he did for 13 minutes was pathetic.
[03:02:09.906 --> 03:02:11.828]  Now, Donald Trump
[03:02:13.740 --> 03:02:14.721]  I love him.
[03:02:14.721 --> 03:02:15.923]  I love that guy.
[03:02:15.923 --> 03:02:17.985]  And what we need is a good leader.
[03:02:17.985 --> 03:02:24.734]  We need somebody as a CEO of this company that's going to bring in some great people underneath him to run this country.
[03:02:24.734 --> 03:02:31.282]  Well, globalism is about screwing your country over and transferring the power to yourself and your buddies offshore, and Trump's exposing all that.
[03:02:31.562 --> 03:02:35.023]  No more tax exemption for mega offshore corporations.
[03:02:35.023 --> 03:02:39.765]  You know, you're not going to shut our power plants down so China can have cheap electricity and we can't.
[03:02:39.765 --> 03:02:44.766]  I mean, it's just all they got to do is take their boot off our neck and we're going to do great again.
[03:02:44.766 --> 03:02:46.047]  Yeah, make America great.
[03:02:46.817 --> 03:02:47.518]  That's it.
[03:02:47.518 --> 03:02:49.260]  Let's make America great.
[03:02:49.260 --> 03:02:51.162]  How the election's going to shake out?
[03:02:51.162 --> 03:02:52.163]  I have no idea.
[03:02:52.163 --> 03:02:52.924]  I have no idea.
[03:02:52.924 --> 03:02:56.768]  You said Gary Haven called you when Trump was on and said, hey, these are the questions I wish he was asking Trump.
[03:02:56.768 --> 03:02:57.789]  What were some of those questions?
[03:02:57.789 --> 03:02:59.992]  Next time he's on, I'll get to them.
[03:02:59.992 --> 03:03:01.534]  Gary's going to have to give those to you.
[03:03:02.834 --> 03:03:07.357]  You know, it's like in between you and Gary, there's so much knowledge that my head explodes.
[03:03:07.357 --> 03:03:09.297]  Oh no, you know as much as I do.
[03:03:09.297 --> 03:03:10.518]  You know more than I do in a while.
[03:03:10.518 --> 03:03:16.961]  Yeah, you know, it's just going back to, you know, I feed off of Gary's passion.
[03:03:16.961 --> 03:03:18.522]  I feed off of his passion.
[03:03:18.522 --> 03:03:20.282]  And that's kind of like Donald Trump.
[03:03:20.282 --> 03:03:26.225]  You know, when we see a leader that's committed and wanting to make America great, you follow.
[03:03:26.225 --> 03:03:27.466]  You will follow this guy.
[03:03:28.266 --> 03:03:30.347]  That's how I felt about Trump.
[03:03:30.347 --> 03:03:37.549]  I know it's a little... Well, the more they pile on him, and the more he stands up to him, I just love it.
[03:03:37.549 --> 03:03:38.849]  And he may not be perfect.
[03:03:38.849 --> 03:03:39.689]  He may screw us over.
[03:03:39.689 --> 03:03:40.429]  But here's the thing.
[03:03:40.429 --> 03:03:41.490]  We know Jeb Bush is bad.
[03:03:41.490 --> 03:03:42.790]  We know Bernie Sanders is bad.
[03:03:42.790 --> 03:03:43.870]  We know Hillary's bad.
[03:03:43.870 --> 03:03:46.751]  So if it's not Ted Cruz, if it's not Rand Paul, I want Trump.
[03:03:46.751 --> 03:03:49.052]  I'll take any one of those three.
[03:03:49.052 --> 03:03:52.213]  Yeah, I'd go Trump-Rand Paul.
[03:03:52.213 --> 03:03:53.053]  Yep.
[03:03:53.053 --> 03:03:54.754]  Period.
[03:03:54.754 --> 03:03:55.574]  My issue is...
[03:03:56.883 --> 03:04:05.165]  I just wish Rand Paul would get tougher, because I know Rand Paul behind the scenes as a listener, a friend, walking, but you know, his staff and the way they do stuff is just too milquetoast.
[03:04:05.165 --> 03:04:07.526]  And look, I'm not going to just sit here and blindly follow Rand Paul.
[03:04:07.526 --> 03:04:08.766]  I'm going to tell him what I think.
[03:04:08.766 --> 03:04:11.267]  And Gary just spent four days with him down in Haiti.
[03:04:11.267 --> 03:04:15.428]  Gary took Rand to Haiti in his plane, went and did some eye surgery.
[03:04:16.928 --> 03:04:20.851]  Um, a mission, or an orphanage down in Haiti, so he flies supplies down there.
[03:04:20.851 --> 03:04:24.813]  He bought an airliner to fly, uh... And to be clear, Gary knows him really well and says he's the real deal.
[03:04:24.813 --> 03:04:25.653]  He's the real deal?
[03:04:25.653 --> 03:04:27.154]  Yeah, I mean, Rand Paul is the real deal.
[03:04:27.154 --> 03:04:31.457]  He is a pro-America patriot who isn't a sellout and really loves this country.
[03:04:31.457 --> 03:04:33.638]  But Gary also had dinner with Ted Cruz.
[03:04:33.638 --> 03:04:36.259]  He's also had, uh, he's vetted all of them.
[03:04:36.259 --> 03:04:37.200]  They've all come to him.
[03:04:38.539 --> 03:04:41.002]  I need to get Gary in here in his own words and tell us what he said about it.
[03:04:41.002 --> 03:04:41.903]  Yeah, he'll be back.
[03:04:41.903 --> 03:04:44.625]  Like I said, Gary's out taking care of business.
[03:04:44.625 --> 03:04:45.947]  Secret location.
[03:04:45.947 --> 03:04:47.528]  Secret location, just like this.
[03:04:47.528 --> 03:04:48.550]  And he's going to be ready to go.
[03:04:48.550 --> 03:04:52.474]  Come January, we're going to hit the road for this film, Amerageddon.
[03:04:52.474 --> 03:04:54.696]  And we're going to hit the road and go promote this film.
[03:04:54.696 --> 03:04:58.400]  Great job, Amerageddon, coming out on Texas Independence Day and Texas only first.
[03:04:58.780 --> 03:04:59.780]  Please, support us.
[03:04:59.780 --> 03:05:00.541]  David Knight, coming up.
[03:05:00.541 --> 03:05:01.341]  Red alert!
[03:05:01.341 --> 03:05:07.104]  Obama brings in 13,000 Muslims who support suicide bombings every year.
[03:05:07.104 --> 03:05:08.024]  Let me explain.
[03:05:08.024 --> 03:05:15.367]  This headline is based upon Pew Research polling data, which is among the most respected polling firms in the world.
[03:05:15.367 --> 03:05:24.951]  And it is an alarming statistic, considering the reality of the Pew Research poll that says 13% of Muslims inside of the United States
[03:05:25.111 --> 03:05:27.032]  Now they're worried about three-year-old orphans.
[03:05:44.844 --> 03:05:50.071]  But facts are facts, regardless of the Obama administration's decision to ignore them.
[03:05:50.071 --> 03:05:56.299]  The radical mindset of the Muslim population in America is here, and it is growing.
[03:05:56.299 --> 03:05:58.902]  You can learn more right now at InfoWars.com.
[03:05:58.902 --> 03:06:00.404]  I want more candy!
[03:06:00.404 --> 03:06:01.605]  I want my baby again!
[03:06:01.605 --> 03:06:02.146]  Why, why, why?
[03:06:03.047 --> 03:06:12.769]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[03:06:12.769 --> 03:06:15.470]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[03:06:15.470 --> 03:06:19.031]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[03:06:19.031 --> 03:06:25.352]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[03:06:25.352 --> 03:06:30.193]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.

[03:08:29.961 --> 03:08:32.542]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:08:32.542 --> 03:08:37.526]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Friday, December 11, 2015.
[03:08:37.526 --> 03:08:39.447]  I'm David Knight, your host in this fourth hour.
[03:08:40.353 --> 03:08:44.376]  I was just watching the trailer for Mike Norris' new film, Amerigeddon.
[03:08:44.376 --> 03:08:48.118]  I'm really anxious to see that, in spite of the fact I have a tiny role in it.
[03:08:48.118 --> 03:08:49.859]  I don't like to watch myself.
[03:08:49.859 --> 03:08:52.401]  I don't watch my news reports.
[03:08:52.401 --> 03:08:55.723]  I don't like to see myself on television, but I do want to see that movie.
[03:08:55.723 --> 03:08:58.925]  And speaking of movies, we have Snake Plissken.
[03:08:59.545 --> 03:09:01.407]  Weighing in on the no-fly list.
[03:09:01.407 --> 03:09:07.972]  And I'm not talking about a clever little clip that we put together where we got the actual from the movie Escape from New York.
[03:09:07.972 --> 03:09:09.914]  No, I'm talking about the actor Kurt Russell.
[03:09:09.914 --> 03:09:19.161]  He has a very reasonable pushback against an interviewer who's haranguing him about the new Quentin Tarantino movie, Hateful Eight, that he's in.
[03:09:19.161 --> 03:09:19.702]  It's a western.
[03:09:20.382 --> 03:09:24.983]  And this guy is like, you know, coming after him because there's gun violence.
[03:09:24.983 --> 03:09:26.724]  And this is set in the Old West.
[03:09:26.724 --> 03:09:30.184]  And Kurt Russell is like, at first is like, are you serious?
[03:09:30.184 --> 03:09:33.205]  Can't you tell the difference between art and real life?
[03:09:33.205 --> 03:09:35.046]  But then he does get serious.
[03:09:35.046 --> 03:09:39.307]  Kurt Russell schools this guy on gun control and on terrorism.
[03:09:39.307 --> 03:09:41.087]  So we're going to have a clip from that.
[03:09:41.087 --> 03:09:48.009]  We're also going to talk a little bit about another film, a new documentary called Killing Them Safely.
[03:09:48.831 --> 03:09:51.494]  Not killing them softly, killing them safely.
[03:09:51.494 --> 03:09:56.359]  Very interesting documentary that's just been released about the Taser Company.
[03:09:56.359 --> 03:10:06.611]  There's one company that makes these electronic devices, and it's interesting how the Taser Company reacted to this filmmaker's film when they put it up on iTunes, but I think it's very interesting.
[03:10:06.611 --> 03:10:08.873]  I'd like to talk to this filmmaker.
[03:10:09.921 --> 03:10:11.322]  Do an interview with him.
[03:10:11.322 --> 03:10:12.944]  I'm going to watch this film this weekend.
[03:10:12.944 --> 03:10:14.745]  I wasn't aware of it until I saw, actually.
[03:10:14.745 --> 03:10:16.147]  Interesting thing about it.
[03:10:16.147 --> 03:10:19.330]  It's kind of the Streisand effect, right?
[03:10:19.330 --> 03:10:25.795]  They didn't like his take on the film, on Taser, so they trolled him.
[03:10:25.795 --> 03:10:27.157]  Gave him a lot of one-star reviews.
[03:10:27.157 --> 03:10:29.519]  They used their real names.
[03:10:29.519 --> 03:10:31.701]  And so it became an issue.
[03:10:31.701 --> 03:10:32.642]  Forbes picked it up.
[03:10:32.642 --> 03:10:34.383]  A lot of different news sites have picked it up.
[03:10:35.524 --> 03:10:36.885]  Congratulations, Taser.
[03:10:36.885 --> 03:10:43.630]  You didn't like that documentary about these high-tech whips that you're creating for police forces worldwide?
[03:10:43.630 --> 03:10:46.331]  Well, now everybody knows about this documentary.
[03:10:46.331 --> 03:10:57.119]  So we'll talk about that, as well as a new development and something I talked about last night on the Nightly News, and that is psychiatric drugs being prescribed to infants.
[03:10:57.119 --> 03:11:02.683]  And these are anti-psychotic drugs that have very severe effects on these infants.
[03:11:03.403 --> 03:11:04.784]  There's been an update on that.
[03:11:04.784 --> 03:11:06.184]  I'm going to tell you about that as well.
[03:11:06.184 --> 03:11:10.447]  So let's first get to the gun issue.
[03:11:10.447 --> 03:11:20.151]  As I point out, this is an interview where this fellow is pushing against Kurt Russell relentlessly, coming after him again and again.
[03:11:20.151 --> 03:11:25.354]  So I just cut out the spots where Kurt Russell said, all right, all right, you want to talk about what's really going on?
[03:11:25.354 --> 03:11:26.495]  Let's talk about what's really going on.
[03:11:26.495 --> 03:11:27.195]  Here's the first clip.
[03:11:28.505 --> 03:11:30.127]  This is the interviewer.
[03:11:43.865 --> 03:11:45.346]  It makes people feel like men, yeah.
[03:12:06.824 --> 03:12:14.871]  Well, if you think gun control or something like that is going to change a terrorist's point of view, I think you're out of your mind.
[03:12:14.871 --> 03:12:15.912]  I think anybody is.
[03:12:15.912 --> 03:12:17.853]  I think it's absolutely insane.
[03:12:17.853 --> 03:12:25.960]  The problem we're having right now is that we don't have the concepts of how to turn it around and say,
[03:12:29.168 --> 03:12:32.771]  You may think you've got me worried about what you're going to do.
[03:12:32.771 --> 03:12:35.612]  Dude, you're about to find out what I'm going to do.
[03:12:35.612 --> 03:12:38.094]  And that's going to worry you a lot more.
[03:12:38.094 --> 03:12:39.595]  And that's what we need.
[03:12:39.595 --> 03:12:55.106]  That will change the concept of gun culture, as you call it, to something of reality, which is, if I'm a hockey team and I've got a guy bearing down on me as a goaltender, I'm not concerned about what he's going to do.
[03:12:55.106 --> 03:12:56.847]  I'm going to make him concerned about what I'm going to do.
[03:12:57.625 --> 03:12:59.167]  Yeah, that is perfect.
[03:12:59.167 --> 03:13:03.872]  He just took that whole thing, the guy said, oh, you know, you got the culture, it's like a, is it a meme, is it a trope?
[03:13:03.872 --> 03:13:06.995]  I don't, it's something like that, you know, and we've got to talk about that.
[03:13:06.995 --> 03:13:13.062]  And he goes, look, if you think you're going to change the terrorist's point of view, you're out of your mind, man.
[03:13:13.762 --> 03:13:18.408]  He says, I'm going to turn it around like a hockey game where I'm bearing down on the goalie.
[03:13:18.408 --> 03:13:20.350]  He's going to be worried about what I'm going to do.
[03:13:20.350 --> 03:13:24.195]  That's the whole point of having an armed citizenry.
[03:13:24.195 --> 03:13:30.662]  That's why an armed citizenry was the constitutional approach to protect our country, certainly for our own self-defense.
[03:13:31.283 --> 03:13:36.848]  It was never the idea, like the New York Times came out this last weekend, where they had a collective editorial.
[03:13:36.848 --> 03:13:39.571]  Put it on the front page, first time they've done that in decades.
[03:13:39.571 --> 03:13:47.177]  A collective editorial from the New York Times staff saying, you need to give up your guns because the government and the police are going to protect you.
[03:13:47.177 --> 03:13:50.781]  And if you have guns, it just makes their job more dangerous and difficult.
[03:13:51.638 --> 03:13:53.519]  No, they don't do that.
[03:13:53.519 --> 03:14:02.223]  They've had numerous court decisions where they've been sued by people because people said you didn't do a very good job of protecting me or my family and they said that's not our job.
[03:14:02.223 --> 03:14:02.783]  That's not our job.
[03:14:02.783 --> 03:14:05.445]  Our job is to enforce the government's policies.
[03:14:05.445 --> 03:14:07.686]  Our job is to write tickets for you.
[03:14:07.686 --> 03:14:10.267]  Our job is to make sure you obey the orders.
[03:14:10.267 --> 03:14:11.428]  It is not to defend you.
[03:14:12.228 --> 03:14:18.490]  And we've had honest police chiefs who said, we'll catch the bad guys, but understand, it's going to take a while before we can get there.
[03:14:18.490 --> 03:14:31.756]  We have many police chiefs talking about that, saying to their citizens, sheriffs and others, saying, look, you need to arm yourself, you need to learn how to use this safely, because we cannot respond quickly enough to help you.
[03:14:31.756 --> 03:14:40.239]  Just as we saw the data coming out this last week, saying when people are armed, the average number of people killed in a mass shooting is just over two.
[03:14:41.019 --> 03:14:46.402]  When there's nobody around that is carrying, the number of people who are killed is just over 14.
[03:14:46.402 --> 03:14:48.484]  That's precisely what Kurt Russell is talking about.
[03:14:48.484 --> 03:14:49.584]  But then there's another clip.
[03:14:49.584 --> 03:14:50.945]  Let's play this second clip.
[03:14:50.945 --> 03:14:52.346]  The interviewer keeps coming after him.
[03:14:52.346 --> 03:14:54.307]  Let's play that clip.
[03:14:54.307 --> 03:15:02.892]  Obama's point was that the guys who are on the no-fly list, no-fly list because of terrorist connections, can get a gun pretty easily.
[03:15:02.892 --> 03:15:04.453]  They can also make a bomb pretty easily.
[03:15:05.163 --> 03:15:06.704]  Yeah.
[03:15:06.704 --> 03:15:08.406]  They didn't kill the people in San Bernardino.
[03:15:08.406 --> 03:15:08.466]  Yes.
[03:15:22.571 --> 03:15:23.531]  That isn't the answer.
[03:15:23.531 --> 03:15:26.033]  Just put some controls.
[03:15:26.033 --> 03:15:27.293]  Put some controls?
[03:15:27.293 --> 03:15:31.835]  What, so the people who want to defend themselves can't?
[03:15:31.835 --> 03:15:33.016]  No, not so you can't.
[03:15:33.016 --> 03:15:34.956]  Just so the idiots can't get a hold of them.
[03:15:34.956 --> 03:15:36.897]  Do you really believe they're not going to?
[03:15:36.897 --> 03:15:38.538]  Are you serious about that?
[03:15:38.538 --> 03:15:39.799]  Are you seriously?
[03:15:39.799 --> 03:15:41.159]  What good will that do?
[03:15:41.159 --> 03:15:43.540]  Oh my God, you and I just disagree.
[03:15:43.540 --> 03:15:44.741]  You and I just disagree.
[03:15:44.741 --> 03:15:49.443]  I understand that you think that you can control
[03:15:50.323 --> 03:15:59.931]  The behavior of people that are dead set on taking your way of life away from you, I think you think you can control that?
[03:15:59.931 --> 03:16:00.452]  No.
[03:16:00.452 --> 03:16:05.976]  And there's only one thing you can do with that, and that's say, no dude, that's not going to happen.
[03:16:05.976 --> 03:16:06.937]  That's just not going to happen.
[03:16:06.937 --> 03:16:09.900]  Very nice to meet you, man.
[03:16:09.900 --> 03:16:11.301]  Good talking with you.
[03:16:11.846 --> 03:16:14.528]  I gotta say, I thought America was dead.
[03:16:14.528 --> 03:16:18.771]  But, you know, Snake Plissken, Kurt Russell has just revived my faith in America.
[03:16:18.771 --> 03:16:25.055]  Common sense, telling this guy, look, you're gonna put them on a list, you're gonna take away their rights because they're on a list.
[03:16:25.055 --> 03:16:33.520]  You think these people, if you think you're really going to keep them from getting a gun because they can't go in and buy one retail, you think they can't get a gun?
[03:16:33.520 --> 03:16:34.781]  Give me a break.
[03:16:34.781 --> 03:16:35.622]  Give me a break.
[03:16:35.622 --> 03:16:38.704]  He points out, of course, they can do bombs pretty easily, they can use cars.
[03:16:39.564 --> 03:16:43.447]  Where I used to live in North Carolina, we had a Muslim drive a car into a crowd.
[03:16:43.447 --> 03:16:47.490]  They didn't report that too much because UNC loves the Muslim community.
[03:16:47.490 --> 03:16:51.153]  They had, you know, Kumbaya parties after 9-11.
[03:16:51.153 --> 03:16:54.175]  But that's the reality of things, folks.
[03:16:54.175 --> 03:16:55.175]  But here's the other reality.
[03:16:56.016 --> 03:16:59.758]  The other reality is that we have something called due process in the law.
[03:16:59.758 --> 03:17:06.280]  The other reality is that we got a president who's got not only a no-fly list, he's got an indefinite detention list.
[03:17:06.280 --> 03:17:08.861]  He's also got an assassination list.
[03:17:08.861 --> 03:17:09.822]  Which list are you on?
[03:17:10.708 --> 03:17:14.412]  You know, he could put you on any one of these lists at any time, and you won't even know it.
[03:17:14.412 --> 03:17:17.975]  You won't know that you're on the no-fly list until they shut you down some way.
[03:17:17.975 --> 03:17:20.338]  Until they say, sorry, you can't travel.
[03:17:20.338 --> 03:17:22.840]  You can't buy something to defend yourself.
[03:17:22.840 --> 03:17:26.224]  Or whatever sanctions they want to put on, attach to this list.
[03:17:26.784 --> 03:17:36.834]  You don't know that you're on the indefinite detention without trial list either, until the military shows up at your door one day and takes you off to a concentration camp, because these are secret lists.
[03:17:36.834 --> 03:17:41.518]  This is the kind of country that we're creating in this world, in America, right here.
[03:17:41.518 --> 03:17:48.746]  This is precisely what is wrong with this country, is the fact that none of our politicians will stand up and object to the fact that we have a list.
[03:17:49.497 --> 03:17:55.159]  They'll debate as to what should be done to the people that the government has put on the list without process.
[03:17:55.159 --> 03:18:02.663]  Let me read to you the Constitution, since we've got a lot of politicians who either don't care or don't know what's in the Constitution.
[03:18:02.663 --> 03:18:07.225]  The Fifth Amendment says no one shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property.
[03:18:07.805 --> 03:18:11.349]  And of course, our rights are a property, okay?
[03:18:11.349 --> 03:18:17.134]  Without due process of law, nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation.
[03:18:17.134 --> 03:18:19.096]  Eminent domain, Donald Trump.
[03:18:19.096 --> 03:18:25.163]  Sixth Amendment says the right to a speedy trial, a public trial, a public trial, folks,
[03:18:25.723 --> 03:18:27.824]  That means no Star Chamber.
[03:18:27.824 --> 03:18:39.728]  They wrote this because there was a secretive judicial process in England that could try people in absentia without them even knowing they've been indicted, without them being able to confront their witnesses.
[03:18:39.728 --> 03:18:40.649]  Oh yeah, that's in there too.
[03:18:41.397 --> 03:18:45.761]  You get a public trial, a speedy trial, an impartial jury.
[03:18:45.761 --> 03:18:51.206]  You are to be informed of the nature and the consent of the accusations against you.
[03:18:51.206 --> 03:18:58.092]  Not put on a secret list by Obama or by George Bush or by Donald Trump or whoever wants to put you on a list.
[03:18:58.092 --> 03:18:58.712]  No.
[03:18:58.712 --> 03:19:01.635]  You are to be confronted with the witnesses against you.
[03:19:01.635 --> 03:19:05.138]  You are to be allowed to provide witnesses in your favor.
[03:19:05.845 --> 03:19:09.909]  And if you can't afford one, you have the assistance of a counsel for your defense.
[03:19:09.909 --> 03:19:11.471]  Oh, but they get around this.
[03:19:11.471 --> 03:19:13.673]  They say, but these are not, this is not criminal.
[03:19:13.673 --> 03:19:15.434]  We haven't charged anybody with it.
[03:19:15.434 --> 03:19:16.295]  This is just civil.
[03:19:16.295 --> 03:19:20.960]  We just take your property with the drug war by saying it's a civil asset forfeiture.
[03:19:20.960 --> 03:19:22.982]  That's why we don't have to give you a trial.
[03:19:22.982 --> 03:19:23.542]  Nonsense!
[03:19:24.483 --> 03:19:25.604]  Nonsense.
[03:19:25.604 --> 03:19:29.567]  If you're going to fall for that kind of sophistry, you're just a slave.
[03:19:29.567 --> 03:19:34.190]  And when they talk about, oh, well, we're not charging you, we're just going to punish you without charging it.
[03:19:34.190 --> 03:19:36.452]  We're going to punish you without giving you a trial.
[03:19:36.452 --> 03:19:39.754]  And when we come back, we're going to talk about what some of the Republican candidates think.
[03:19:39.754 --> 03:19:49.261]  We know what the Democrats think about this, taking your guns if you're on some super secret list that they put you on without any due process.
[03:19:49.261 --> 03:19:51.303]  We're going to tell you what the Republicans say about that when we come back.
[03:19:51.303 --> 03:19:51.663]  Stay with us.
[03:20:00.603 --> 03:20:11.508]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?
[03:20:11.508 --> 03:20:15.670]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives, and you could be one of them.
[03:20:15.670 --> 03:20:17.831]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[03:20:17.831 --> 03:20:23.293]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.
[03:20:23.473 --> 03:20:33.477]  What happens with the formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[03:20:33.477 --> 03:20:39.980]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[03:20:39.980 --> 03:20:43.322]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics.
[03:20:43.322 --> 03:20:45.383]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[03:20:45.383 --> 03:20:48.484]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[03:20:48.584 --> 03:20:52.049]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[03:20:52.049 --> 03:20:53.791]  Deep Cleanse by Infowarslife.com.

[03:24:14.463 --> 03:24:15.664]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:15.664 --> 03:24:18.826]  I'm David Knight, your host on this Friday, December 11th.
[03:24:18.826 --> 03:24:20.347]  We have some specials today.
[03:24:20.347 --> 03:24:27.092]  One of those is, of course, free shipping on all InfoWarsStore.com orders for at least the next week.
[03:24:27.092 --> 03:24:29.374]  That ends, I think, yes, it is one week.
[03:24:29.374 --> 03:24:29.915]  It's December 18th.
[03:24:30.715 --> 03:24:32.236]  We also have some other specials.
[03:24:32.236 --> 03:24:39.399]  The Essentials Pack, Survival Shield X2, Super Male, Female Vitality, Silver Bullet, 33% off if you get those three together.
[03:24:39.399 --> 03:24:44.902]  Also, a Deep Cleansing Pack, where you get Deep Cleanse, Living Defense, and Oxy Powder, 28% off.
[03:24:48.064 --> 03:24:50.866]  Winter sun, vitamin D3, 15% off.
[03:24:50.866 --> 03:24:57.651]  All of those are there, plus you get free shipping again for anything that you order at InfoWars store.
[03:24:57.651 --> 03:25:02.455]  I'm anxious to look at the new product that we have, the InfoWars solar base station power supply.
[03:25:02.455 --> 03:25:05.158]  That's something I've looked at buying for myself for quite some time.
[03:25:05.158 --> 03:25:15.306]  I haven't done it before because of the price, but the price is very, very aggressive on this solar power plus battery plus inverter and AC outlets.
[03:25:15.306 --> 03:25:15.967]  It's a great
[03:25:16.767 --> 03:25:21.209]  That's something everybody should have as a backup generator at the very least.
[03:25:21.209 --> 03:25:24.070]  I want to get back to what we were talking about in the last segment.
[03:25:24.070 --> 03:25:26.010]  And that is, are we going to take people's guns?
[03:25:26.010 --> 03:25:29.551]  Are we going to start to punish people without due process?
[03:25:29.551 --> 03:25:39.095]  Because throughout the war on drugs, since the time of Ronald Reagan, we have been stealing property from people without charging them of a crime, without convicting them.
[03:25:39.844 --> 03:25:44.108]  And so now, we're going to start taking away other things from people.
[03:25:44.108 --> 03:25:47.230]  Things like their rights to have and own a gun.
[03:25:47.230 --> 03:25:51.434]  We're going to take that away because we're going to put them on a secret list that they don't know.
[03:25:51.434 --> 03:25:52.975]  We're not going to charge them with any crimes.
[03:25:52.975 --> 03:25:55.398]  We're not going to take them through the due process procedure.
[03:25:55.398 --> 03:25:56.779]  They're not going to get a public trial.
[03:25:56.779 --> 03:25:58.400]  As a matter of fact, they won't even know.
[03:25:58.400 --> 03:25:58.781]  How's that?
[03:25:58.781 --> 03:26:02.143]  They won't even know until they go to get their gun or go to fly on a plane.
[03:26:02.143 --> 03:26:03.765]  They won't even know that they're on a no-fly list.
[03:26:03.765 --> 03:26:04.486]  Won't that be great?
[03:26:05.441 --> 03:26:11.446]  And of course, it isn't going to help us to fight the terrorists, because they're going to find their ways to get guns.
[03:26:11.446 --> 03:26:13.528]  They're not going to go down to Walmart to get their guns.
[03:26:13.528 --> 03:26:18.072]  They'll do that if it's really easy, but that's not really much of an obstacle anywhere else for them to get guns.
[03:26:18.072 --> 03:26:20.414]  They can get guns in the Northeast anywhere they want to.
[03:26:21.280 --> 03:26:24.361]  Black markets spring up wherever you've got prohibition, folks.
[03:26:24.361 --> 03:26:25.921]  Remember alcohol?
[03:26:25.921 --> 03:26:26.922]  Remember the war on drugs?
[03:26:26.922 --> 03:26:28.342]  Yeah, we're still doing that, aren't we?
[03:26:28.342 --> 03:26:36.204]  40 some odd years, 44 years, it was 1971, Richard Nixon put that in, enacting that UN agenda.
[03:26:36.204 --> 03:26:44.146]  Down to the letter, down to the last, all four schedules, the drugs that they wanted to put schedule by schedule, that was created by the UN in 1961.
[03:26:44.146 --> 03:26:46.287]  Conservatives ought to be concerned about that.
[03:26:47.452 --> 03:26:53.176]  The UN created this agenda in 1961 and Richard Nixon implemented it in 1971 and called it the War on Drugs.
[03:26:53.176 --> 03:27:03.222]  And then Ronald Reagan came in and said, you know, we're going to take people's property without convicting them, without even charging them.
[03:27:03.222 --> 03:27:08.586]  And we'll get around the Constitution by saying it's not a criminal action, it's a civil action.
[03:27:08.586 --> 03:27:10.707]  And so we've allowed that to go on for now 30 years.
[03:27:13.018 --> 03:27:20.402]  So Obama thinks that he can take other rights of ours, and let's see where the Republican candidates are, because we all know that Hillary agrees with that, with Obama's action.
[03:27:20.402 --> 03:27:24.484]  We've got a Connecticut governor who is now saying that he's going to start implementing that.
[03:27:24.484 --> 03:27:29.706]  He's going to look and see if you're on the no-fly list, and if you are, then he's going to take away your rights to have guns.
[03:27:29.706 --> 03:27:32.527]  I think people need to arrest him.
[03:27:32.527 --> 03:27:39.511]  Arrest that Connecticut governor who thinks that he's going to turn America into some kind of a star chamber dictatorship.
[03:27:40.444 --> 03:27:46.046]  Or some kind of Star Chamber Spanish Inquisition can put you on a list and take everything that you've got.
[03:27:46.046 --> 03:27:50.748]  Because they're not going to stop just by confiscating your car on the road to civil asset forfeiture.
[03:27:50.748 --> 03:27:52.448]  They're not going to stop by taking your guns.
[03:27:52.448 --> 03:27:53.629]  It's going to just continue to go.
[03:27:53.629 --> 03:27:54.709]  They're going to have more lists.
[03:27:54.709 --> 03:27:59.391]  Like I pointed out, he's already got a no-fly list, an indefinite detention list, an assassination list.
[03:28:00.071 --> 03:28:01.552]  Are you on any of those?
[03:28:01.552 --> 03:28:03.533]  Well, you don't know, do you?
[03:28:03.533 --> 03:28:06.355]  Because there's no rule of law in America anymore.
[03:28:06.355 --> 03:28:08.135]  So where do the Republican candidates fall on this?
[03:28:08.135 --> 03:28:09.356]  Well, we had this last Sunday.
[03:28:09.356 --> 03:28:13.158]  Several of them were asked about this specific situation.
[03:28:13.158 --> 03:28:21.523]  If somebody's on a no-fly list, and the assumption that the Democrats have, the assumption the mainstream media is putting out there, if you're on that list, you're a terrorist.
[03:28:22.346 --> 03:28:23.568]  It's like, no you're not.
[03:28:23.568 --> 03:28:23.929]  No you're not.
[03:28:23.929 --> 03:28:33.426]  So you had, that was the first line of defense and the only line really that they brought up because they don't want to push back against the idea that they're not giving people due process.
[03:28:34.389 --> 03:28:37.950]  Republican candidates are not standing up for that, except for Rand Paul.
[03:28:37.950 --> 03:28:42.772]  He's the only one who's had any problem with civil asset forfeiture, but Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush don't.
[03:28:42.772 --> 03:28:49.734]  At least Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush said, look, you had people like former Senator Ted Kennedy who showed up on the list.
[03:28:49.734 --> 03:28:52.755]  You had people like Cat Stevens show up on the list.
[03:28:52.755 --> 03:28:56.056]  Conservative writer Stephen Hayes, they got put on the no-fly list.
[03:28:56.656 --> 03:28:58.998]  And they were put on there by accident.
[03:28:58.998 --> 03:29:02.120]  You got people who have similar names to somebody else put on there.
[03:29:02.120 --> 03:29:05.923]  We've had toddlers and infants put on the no-fly list.
[03:29:05.923 --> 03:29:10.686]  So, that was their line of defense, and say, we're not going to take away people's guns because they're on some list.
[03:29:10.686 --> 03:29:18.452]  And Rubio goes on to say, though, just, he says, now, if it were a perfect list, if it were a perfect list, are you kidding me?
[03:29:19.972 --> 03:29:21.593]  Read the Constitution.
[03:29:21.593 --> 03:29:25.176]  You're not going to have your property taken away without due process.
[03:29:25.176 --> 03:29:28.139]  Due process means it's a public trial with witnesses.
[03:29:28.139 --> 03:29:29.260]  You know what the charges are.
[03:29:29.260 --> 03:29:31.182]  You know you're being charged with something.
[03:29:31.182 --> 03:29:33.463]  So there isn't any perfect list.
[03:29:33.463 --> 03:29:35.966]  There's something called due process.
[03:29:35.966 --> 03:29:41.690]  When we come back, I'm going to tell you about what's going on with this shooting up our children.
[03:29:41.690 --> 03:29:43.552]  Not with guns, but with needles.
[03:29:43.552 --> 03:29:43.932]  Stay with us.
[03:29:43.932 --> 03:29:44.473]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:49.352 --> 03:29:52.360]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[03:29:52.360 --> 03:29:55.990]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:00.211 --> 03:30:04.912]  Anti-gunners are planning a very pungent protest this weekend in Austin, Texas.
[03:30:04.912 --> 03:30:13.615]  In response to pro-CCL activists staging a mock mass shooting, counter-demonstrators will resort to waving dildos and mass farting.
[03:30:13.615 --> 03:30:18.296]  Yes, this is the self-defense equivalent of peeing yourself to stop a rape.
[03:30:18.296 --> 03:30:26.178]  With cardboard guns and fake blood, Come and Take It Texas and DontComply.com are pitching a life and liberty event to end gun-free zones.
[03:30:26.638 --> 03:30:34.044]  The active shooter drill will take place near the University of Texas this Saturday, but this time the shooter picks the wrong crowd.
[03:30:34.044 --> 03:30:45.033]  The planned event comes at a particularly tense time in the nation's gun debate, and Texas colleges and universities are debating how to implement the state's new campus carry law that will start next fall.
[03:30:45.033 --> 03:30:52.539]  But gun control advocates say this event is offensive, and so they're staging a mass farting and dildo waving counter-protest.
[03:30:53.931 --> 03:30:55.455]  You fart in your general direction!
[03:30:55.455 --> 03:30:57.961]  Read more about this event at InfoWars.com
[03:30:59.758 --> 03:31:03.281]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[03:31:03.281 --> 03:31:11.527]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[03:31:11.527 --> 03:31:16.951]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[03:31:16.951 --> 03:31:19.493]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[03:31:30.769 --> 03:31:32.970]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[03:31:32.970 --> 03:31:37.973]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[03:31:37.973 --> 03:31:41.255]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[03:31:41.255 --> 03:31:44.737]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[03:31:44.737 --> 03:31:46.438]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[03:31:46.718 --> 03:31:47.638]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[03:31:47.638 --> 03:31:48.839]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[03:31:48.839 --> 03:31:50.819]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[03:31:50.819 --> 03:31:57.581]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.

[03:33:12.495 --> 03:33:18.139]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[03:33:18.139 --> 03:33:21.101]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:33:21.101 --> 03:33:25.644]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:25.644 --> 03:33:26.304]  I'm David Knight.
[03:33:26.304 --> 03:33:34.850]  We were just talking about the tepid, limp-wristed response to taking people's guns because they're on a super-secret list.
[03:33:35.615 --> 03:33:36.956]  Of course, that's what Obama wants to do.
[03:33:36.956 --> 03:33:38.317]  Hillary supports it.
[03:33:38.317 --> 03:33:39.797]  All the Democrats support it.
[03:33:39.797 --> 03:33:43.099]  Connecticut governor says he's going to enact that.
[03:33:43.099 --> 03:33:50.123]  And this Sunday you had Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush come out and say, well, you know, sometimes there's mistakes on that list and so I wouldn't take people's guns.
[03:33:50.123 --> 03:33:52.884]  And it's not exactly a perfect list.
[03:33:52.884 --> 03:33:54.685]  If it were, we could take their guns or whatever.
[03:33:54.685 --> 03:33:57.947]  No, you're not a terrorist because Obama puts you on a list.
[03:33:57.947 --> 03:34:00.829]  You're not a terrorist because the next president puts you on the list.
[03:34:01.547 --> 03:34:04.888]  You're just living in a post-constitutional America.
[03:34:04.888 --> 03:34:06.289]  But what did some of the other candidates say?
[03:34:06.289 --> 03:34:21.614]  Well, John Kasich was asked the same question, and he said, you know, I think it's a good idea to keep people on the no-fly list from buying guns, but he added that doing so could tip them off that they're under watch, and it could hurt ongoing investigations.
[03:34:21.614 --> 03:34:25.735]  So, you know, oh, let's maybe, yeah, we could take their guns, oh no, but then they would
[03:34:26.175 --> 03:34:28.656]  They would know that they're on this super-secret list, you know.
[03:34:28.656 --> 03:34:32.278]  Maybe we need to have a double super-secret list that we put them on.
[03:34:32.278 --> 03:34:33.259]  I don't know.
[03:34:33.259 --> 03:34:42.624]  Yeah, we got a, you know, we got this secret government, operates in the dark, taking our rights without due process, but, you know, yeah, don't tell them that they're on the list, you know.
[03:34:42.624 --> 03:34:44.205]  Then you got Donald Trump.
[03:34:44.205 --> 03:34:47.507]  Donald Trump says, I'd certainly take a look at that.
[03:34:47.507 --> 03:34:50.208]  Taking people's guns because they're on the no-fly list.
[03:34:50.208 --> 03:34:54.691]  And he says, you know, I'm very strong into the whole thing with Second Amendment.
[03:34:55.452 --> 03:35:01.113]  But if you can't fly, and if you've got some really bad... Well, I would look at that very hard.
[03:35:01.113 --> 03:35:01.894]  Yeah.
[03:35:01.894 --> 03:35:04.354]  In other words, yeah, I'm not even going to question the fact that we've got a list.
[03:35:04.354 --> 03:35:05.035]  None of them do.
[03:35:05.035 --> 03:35:05.575]  None of them do.
[03:35:05.575 --> 03:35:07.875]  None of them question what the constitutional requirements are.
[03:35:07.875 --> 03:35:11.056]  They just look at the pragmatics of this, you know?
[03:35:11.056 --> 03:35:12.076]  Well, can we do this?
[03:35:12.076 --> 03:35:17.518]  Is it going to make us safer if we take everybody's guns, if we take everybody's rights, if we treat everybody like slaves?
[03:35:17.518 --> 03:35:21.459]  You know, if you don't have any principles, everything is up for grabs.
[03:35:22.199 --> 03:35:28.142]  You know, if you don't have any principles that you hold dear about freedom of speech, that's up for grabs.
[03:35:28.142 --> 03:35:30.003]  The Internet's up for grabs.
[03:35:30.003 --> 03:35:32.544]  Your due process, your private property is up for grabs.
[03:35:32.544 --> 03:35:35.206]  If they think they need it, or they want it, they just take it.
[03:35:36.175 --> 03:35:39.738]  Because there's no principles to stop them from doing that.
[03:35:39.738 --> 03:35:41.760]  You know, we have another right.
[03:35:41.760 --> 03:35:50.849]  We have a right, and this is not in the Constitution, it's not protected in the Constitution, it's not deliberately enumerated in the Constitution as part of the Bill of Rights.
[03:35:50.849 --> 03:35:52.891]  We have a right to actually overthrow this government.
[03:35:53.812 --> 03:35:56.973]  That's in the Declaration of Independence when they're talking about why they were doing the revolution.
[03:35:56.973 --> 03:36:05.317]  They said, we have a right and a duty when a government comes after our rights to alter or abolish that government.
[03:36:05.317 --> 03:36:09.018]  Because the governments were set up to protect our rights.
[03:36:09.018 --> 03:36:13.220]  The governments were not set up so that these guys could have a lifelong career.
[03:36:13.220 --> 03:36:19.463]  They weren't set up so that they could have a life of luxury, a lavish pension.
[03:36:20.263 --> 03:36:26.654]  No, they were set up to protect our rights, but of course that's what it's become in post-constitutional America.
[03:36:26.654 --> 03:36:32.704]  And before I move on to what's going on with this vaccine situation, because that's another one of our rights that they're taking away.
[03:36:34.039 --> 03:36:35.581]  I want to talk about this recent court decision.
[03:36:35.581 --> 03:36:41.087]  Of course, this has to do with yet another one of these secret lists, the assassination list.
[03:36:41.087 --> 03:36:43.369]  Of course, they call it the disposition matrix.
[03:36:43.369 --> 03:36:44.110]  Isn't that great?
[03:36:44.110 --> 03:36:47.834]  Doesn't that sound kind of like a Robert Ludlum spy novel, you know, from back when?
[03:36:47.834 --> 03:36:49.236]  Was that in the 70s or whatever?
[03:36:49.236 --> 03:36:50.797]  The disposition matrix.
[03:36:50.797 --> 03:36:52.579]  No, it's nothing but a kill list.
[03:36:53.413 --> 03:37:00.615]  It's just a dirty little kill list by a bunch of people who have no respect for human life, no respect for the Constitution that they swore to.
[03:37:00.615 --> 03:37:01.655]  Okay?
[03:37:01.655 --> 03:37:10.637]  The disposition matrix contains the names of terrorist suspects arrayed against an accounting of resources that they can use to track them down.
[03:37:10.637 --> 03:37:13.398]  It includes sealed indictments.
[03:37:13.398 --> 03:37:16.059]  Oh, we can't tell people that we're really going to kill them, can we?
[03:37:16.059 --> 03:37:17.479]  You know, that we're tracking them for this.
[03:37:17.479 --> 03:37:19.960]  And it also contains clandestine operations.
[03:37:20.780 --> 03:37:25.562]  Our entire government is now a dark CIA government.
[03:37:25.562 --> 03:37:27.682]  They're the ones who run the government, folks.
[03:37:27.682 --> 03:37:41.127]  Alright, for the last four years, they point out in this article, the New York Times journalist Charlie Savage has waged a battle against the Obama administration, seeking to reveal the government's legal justifications for assassinating terror suspects without a trial.
[03:37:41.127 --> 03:37:42.008]  Without a trial.
[03:37:42.008 --> 03:37:48.670]  I talked last night a great deal about Saudi Arabia, how they're on track to have the most number of executions ever.
[03:37:50.061 --> 03:37:53.062]  They've already had more than they've had in a couple of decades.
[03:37:53.062 --> 03:37:54.663]  They've had 150 beheadings this year.
[03:37:54.663 --> 03:37:57.644]  Of course, you can get beheaded for just about anything.
[03:37:57.644 --> 03:38:08.247]  If they accuse you of stampeding people at the stoning of Satan ceremony in Mecca, then they beheaded 28 people for that.
[03:38:08.247 --> 03:38:11.568]  They've got another 50 people that they say they're going to behead in a single day.
[03:38:11.568 --> 03:38:13.289]  That'll put them over the limit.
[03:38:13.289 --> 03:38:14.509]  That'll set the new record.
[03:38:14.509 --> 03:38:16.250]  So Guinness people need to get ready for that.
[03:38:16.250 --> 03:38:18.931]  But of course, we have a government that also kills people.
[03:38:19.764 --> 03:38:21.965]  And doesn't pretend to have any good reason for it.
[03:38:21.965 --> 03:38:32.348]  So the ACLU has been fighting for 11 memos that would basically give them an idea of what the legal justification is supposed to be for this.
[03:38:32.348 --> 03:38:34.009]  And of course there is no legal justification.
[03:38:34.815 --> 03:38:46.283]  I guess you could just get this out in the open, but you know, we all know there's no legal justification, don't we, for a government that's just going to assassinate people by putting them on a list, and of course that includes Americans.
[03:38:46.283 --> 03:38:56.350]  We saw that happen with Anwar al-Awlaki and his, later then, his 16-year-old son, both of whom were American citizens, both of whom used to be wined and dined by the CIA and the Pentagon.
[03:38:56.350 --> 03:38:59.753]  They used to be a part of the inside, but you know, just like Manuel Noriega,
[03:39:00.393 --> 03:39:06.940]  You cross these guys in the CIA like George Bush, and pretty soon they start calling you a strongman or a terrorist.
[03:39:06.940 --> 03:39:09.103]  And then they come down and they kill you.
[03:39:09.103 --> 03:39:15.990]  So they say, according to the ACLU, of more than the 500 credibly reported strikes, only 9 have been acknowledged on the record.
[03:39:15.990 --> 03:39:21.597]  Of more than 4,800 credibly reported deaths, only 11 have been acknowledged by the United States government.
[03:39:22.230 --> 03:39:26.973]  We don't know how many individuals are currently on the kill list.
[03:39:26.973 --> 03:39:29.754]  So that's the state of America, folks.
[03:39:29.754 --> 03:39:35.017]  And that's what our Republican candidates can't or won't get their head around.
[03:39:35.017 --> 03:39:36.658]  With the exception of Rand Paul.
[03:39:36.658 --> 03:39:42.602]  He has talked about it, but of course they're not going to include him in the next debate because they say that he hasn't made the poll numbers on it.
[03:39:43.803 --> 03:39:49.006]  We're going to have people who would consider it strongly, like Donald Trump.
[03:39:49.006 --> 03:40:03.414]  He's very strong into that whole Second Amendment thing, because his advisors had told him, if you don't want to lose the vote of the Republicans, get yourself a Bible and a gun and talk about the fact you've got a Bible and a gun and you love these things.
[03:40:03.414 --> 03:40:04.135]  You really love that.
[03:40:04.135 --> 03:40:05.095]  I love that Bible.
[03:40:05.095 --> 03:40:07.797]  I've got this Bible sitting on my counter.
[03:40:07.797 --> 03:40:09.718]  I've got a gun in my back pocket.
[03:40:09.718 --> 03:40:12.779]  I'm into that whole thing about the Second Amendment, whatever that is.
[03:40:13.956 --> 03:40:16.918]  But you know, hey, if you're dangerous, I'll take it.
[03:40:16.918 --> 03:40:23.481]  If you are somebody that maybe we think you're, we want to label you a terrorist, we'll shut down the internet or corners of the internet.
[03:40:23.481 --> 03:40:26.323]  You know, we'll just censor that and take away that freedom.
[03:40:26.323 --> 03:40:30.205]  And along that line, you know, we have terror suspects.
[03:40:30.205 --> 03:40:34.988]  It's not just terror suspects, but anybody that the police give an order to.
[03:40:34.988 --> 03:40:41.031]  You know, if you don't do what they tell you, they pull out their new 21st century whip, the Taser.
[03:40:42.025 --> 03:40:46.386]  And of course the tasers are made, there's only one company that makes this, Taser International.
[03:40:46.386 --> 03:40:54.388]  They sell it worldwide, and it basically has become our masters on this plantation that we live on.
[03:40:54.388 --> 03:41:03.711]  Give the overseers this electronic whip, and they say, you know, if the slaves don't do whatever you tell them to as quickly as you want them to, you just hit them with this thing.
[03:41:03.711 --> 03:41:05.332]  Don't worry, it won't kill them.
[03:41:05.332 --> 03:41:06.252]  Well, sometimes it does.
[03:41:07.162 --> 03:41:15.649]  So we've got a documentary film done by filmmaker Nick Berardini, I think is the way you pronounce his name, called Killing Them Safely.
[03:41:15.649 --> 03:41:27.219]  It just went onto iTunes and he got, I wouldn't have known about it except the employees at Taser International have been trolling him on iTunes to give him a very low rating.
[03:41:27.219 --> 03:41:28.581]  Now he's gotten 89% positive ratings
[03:41:30.582 --> 03:41:35.204]  On Rotten Tomatoes, he's won a lot of film awards, film festivals.
[03:41:35.204 --> 03:41:37.144]  It's a documentary film, so it's small.
[03:41:37.144 --> 03:41:39.865]  You're probably not going to see it in the theaters, but you can see it.
[03:41:39.865 --> 03:41:41.286]  Video on demand.
[03:41:41.286 --> 03:41:44.027]  And the film homes in on a number of cases where the taser was used.
[03:41:44.027 --> 03:41:45.887]  Subsequently, the target died.
[03:41:45.887 --> 03:41:52.690]  In particular, the case of that of Stanley Harlan, a 23-year-old from Moberly, Missouri, who was pulled over for speeding.
[03:41:52.690 --> 03:41:57.231]  He was tasered for 31 seconds in the chest.
[03:41:57.231 --> 03:41:58.372]  And he died in front of his mother.
[03:41:59.915 --> 03:42:04.864]  It also looks in depth at the case of Robert Zajkonski.
[03:42:04.864 --> 03:42:05.806]  I don't know how to pronounce his name.
[03:42:05.806 --> 03:42:11.156]  He's a Polish national who died after being hit five times with a taser at a Vancouver airport in 2007.
[03:42:13.174 --> 03:42:22.123]  And so yeah, they sell us these non-lethal weapons, and of course, I think it'd be interesting to talk to this filmmaker, because this is a big and expanding, rapidly expanding area.
[03:42:22.123 --> 03:42:24.465]  We're talking about the military-industrial complex.
[03:42:24.465 --> 03:42:29.891]  There is a police state-industrial complex, making a lot of money selling weapons to the police.
[03:42:29.891 --> 03:42:30.631]  And it's not just
[03:42:31.312 --> 03:42:38.135]  The MRAPs that are being given to them, those white elephants that the Pentagon is offloading to the police departments.
[03:42:38.135 --> 03:42:40.096]  No, it's this type of stuff.
[03:42:40.096 --> 03:42:44.077]  There's a lot of quote-unquote non-lethal weapons that are being put out there.
[03:42:44.077 --> 03:42:47.399]  Things that will kill you, things that will leave you permanently disabled.
[03:42:47.399 --> 03:42:49.980]  We just had a situation not too long ago here in Bastrop.
[03:42:49.980 --> 03:42:51.581]  We talked about that quite a bit on InfoWars.
[03:42:51.581 --> 03:42:55.962]  If you remember, there was a student in the Bastrop High School.
[03:42:55.962 --> 03:42:56.943]  There was a fight going on.
[03:42:58.495 --> 03:43:00.256]  He broke up the fight, actually.
[03:43:00.256 --> 03:43:01.736]  And he was just standing there, nothing was happening.
[03:43:01.736 --> 03:43:05.478]  You'd see that from the video that was taken at the time in the school.
[03:43:05.478 --> 03:43:10.040]  And the in-school cop, which we never had when I was in school, we didn't need them.
[03:43:10.040 --> 03:43:12.000]  And you don't need them now, by the way.
[03:43:12.000 --> 03:43:23.985]  The in-school cop comes up and just, this big fat cop just comes up with his taser drawn, shoots the kid, and he goes straight down on the concrete floor, hits his head, and now he has been mentally disabled for the rest of his life.
[03:43:24.685 --> 03:43:26.827]  We've had situations here elsewhere in Texas.
[03:43:26.827 --> 03:43:31.411]  We had, uh, there was an automobile accident and the guy was in the car.
[03:43:31.411 --> 03:43:34.434]  And he was having a hypoglycemic incident.
[03:43:34.434 --> 03:43:36.196]  He couldn't talk to the cop.
[03:43:36.196 --> 03:43:37.397]  And the cop was giving him orders.
[03:43:37.397 --> 03:43:37.917]  Get out of the car.
[03:43:37.917 --> 03:43:38.558]  Get out of the car.
[03:43:38.558 --> 03:43:39.459]  He wouldn't get out of the car.
[03:43:39.459 --> 03:43:40.139]  He wouldn't move.
[03:43:40.139 --> 03:43:42.061]  He wasn't doing anything to threaten the officer.
[03:43:42.061 --> 03:43:45.865]  He just wasn't obeying his master quickly enough.
[03:43:45.865 --> 03:43:47.126]  Didn't jump high enough.
[03:43:47.126 --> 03:43:49.068]  Didn't jump quickly enough.
[03:43:49.068 --> 03:43:50.389]  And so, he got tasered.
[03:43:51.553 --> 03:43:56.256]  And I think, if I remember correctly, well I shouldn't say it, I think he died in that particular incident.
[03:43:56.256 --> 03:43:57.757]  He had a stroke.
[03:43:57.757 --> 03:44:01.980]  It was a very serious consequence of that.
[03:44:01.980 --> 03:44:06.564]  Now let's talk about the other ways that they shoot you.
[03:44:06.564 --> 03:44:09.606]  We are seeing many people who don't respect our right.
[03:44:09.606 --> 03:44:15.630]  It's always this side of the political spectrum that wants to censor people who disagree with them.
[03:44:15.630 --> 03:44:16.691]  They want to take the
[03:44:17.637 --> 03:44:21.198]  Weapons of people that are rightfully ours to use in our self-defense.
[03:44:21.198 --> 03:44:25.419]  And they want to deny our informed consent when it comes to medication.
[03:44:25.419 --> 03:44:29.079]  And I'm not just talking about forcing you to take a vaccine.
[03:44:29.079 --> 03:44:34.441]  I'm talking about denying your informed consent if you're a cancer patient and you'd like to take medicine.
[03:44:34.441 --> 03:44:34.741]  Okay?
[03:44:34.741 --> 03:44:37.841]  That's the FDA steps in and says, no, no, we haven't approved that yet.
[03:44:37.841 --> 03:44:38.961]  You can't have it.
[03:44:38.961 --> 03:44:42.882]  We're just going to let you die because, you know, that we haven't tested that to see if it's safe yet.
[03:44:42.882 --> 03:44:43.843]  It's like, it's my body.
[03:44:43.843 --> 03:44:44.603]  It's my decision.
[03:44:44.603 --> 03:44:45.823]  I should be able to make that decision.
[03:44:46.769 --> 03:44:52.195]  But they don't respect your informed consent, but I just want to read you this story.
[03:44:52.195 --> 03:44:53.156]  We talked about this last night.
[03:44:53.156 --> 03:44:54.837]  It was on the New York Times.
[03:44:54.837 --> 03:44:59.062]  They began with a particular incident here.
[03:44:59.062 --> 03:45:00.183]  That's the way they began their article.
[03:45:00.916 --> 03:45:05.158]  Andrew Rios's seizures began when he was five months old and only got worse.
[03:45:05.158 --> 03:45:20.745]  At 18 months, when an epilepsy medication resulted in violent behavior, a neurologist prescribed him the antipsychotic Risperdal, a drug typically used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in adults, rarely used for children as young as five.
[03:45:21.365 --> 03:45:32.150]  When Andrew screamed in his sleep and seemed to interact with people and objects that were not there, his frightened mother researched Risperdal and discovered the drug was not approved.
[03:45:32.150 --> 03:45:35.912]  And she said, it was like, just take this, it's no big deal, the doctor said.
[03:45:35.912 --> 03:45:39.054]  It was like they were Tic Tacs, but he was just a baby.
[03:45:39.054 --> 03:45:39.754]  He was just a baby.
[03:45:41.127 --> 03:45:42.847]  Now, think about this.
[03:45:42.847 --> 03:45:46.228]  His seizures began when he was five months old.
[03:45:46.228 --> 03:45:50.629]  Now, I don't know if that was due to a vaccine reaction.
[03:45:50.629 --> 03:46:04.211]  I do know that in the vaccine court, we have seen over and over and over again, people who immediately after their children got vaccinated, they began having uncontrollable seizures, continuous seizures.
[03:46:04.211 --> 03:46:08.732]  It's a very common adverse side effect from vaccinations for young children.
[03:46:09.653 --> 03:46:18.742]  As a matter of fact, here in Texas we had Representative David Simpson, a stellar individual with a backbone and a rock solid compass.
[03:46:18.742 --> 03:46:26.048]  He was the one who nearly got the TSA shut down on their child molestation at the airport.
[03:46:26.048 --> 03:46:30.372]  Nearly shut that down, but of course the TSA said, no, if you guys pass that bill,
[03:46:31.530 --> 03:46:33.931]  We're going to declare Texas a no-fly zone.
[03:46:33.931 --> 03:46:41.576]  And our former CIA Lieutenant Governor, Dewhurst, got the Senate to vote it down after it had passed unanimously in the House.
[03:46:41.576 --> 03:46:54.703]  And of course, we later learned through a mistake of the government in a lawsuit when they posted unredacted documents from the TSA, that at the same time in 2011, the TSA was saying there is no threat against airports or airplanes.
[03:46:54.703 --> 03:47:00.527]  At the same time, they wanted to turn Texas into a no-fly zone if we didn't let them play their little TSA games with us.
[03:47:01.598 --> 03:47:06.885]  Alright, so, going back to this particular account here.
[03:47:06.885 --> 03:47:14.375]  We have the same, the reason I got off on that, David Simpson introduced several bills to try to get marijuana decriminalized.
[03:47:14.375 --> 03:47:17.459]  He's a conservative Republican, but he knows what's going on.
[03:47:18.286 --> 03:47:26.272]  And at the very least, what they were able to do, and it was a couple of people that were in his district, they had children who had uncontrollable epileptic seizures.
[03:47:26.272 --> 03:47:30.815]  One of the families was able to go to Colorado and get marijuana treatment.
[03:47:30.815 --> 03:47:33.316]  The other family could not afford to go there.
[03:47:33.316 --> 03:47:37.880]  The one who did go to Colorado and get marijuana treatment, their child recovered.
[03:47:37.880 --> 03:47:43.563]  But the other child continued to suffer because they couldn't take the time off and relocate the family to go out there.
[03:47:43.563 --> 03:47:46.746]  And so what they did was, in Texas, in Texas of all places,
[03:47:47.472 --> 03:47:50.253]  You know, the place where they love their drug war.
[03:47:50.253 --> 03:47:56.056]  They passed a medical marijuana exception for children who have epileptic seizures.
[03:47:56.056 --> 03:48:00.197]  Now, what is pharmaceutical, what's big pharmaceutical doing about this?
[03:48:00.197 --> 03:48:06.420]  Well, in the last year, 20,000 prescriptions for risperidone, commonly known as Risperdal,
[03:48:07.393 --> 03:48:10.315]  And other anti-psychotic medications were written in 2014.
[03:48:10.315 --> 03:48:13.777]  That's a 50% jump in one year.
[03:48:13.777 --> 03:48:18.861]  Giving them these hardcore anti-psychotic medications, which I would say are psychotic medications.
[03:48:18.861 --> 03:48:21.062]  And this kid was seeing stuff that wasn't there.
[03:48:21.062 --> 03:48:21.983]  He's hallucinating.
[03:48:21.983 --> 03:48:23.144]  Okay?
[03:48:23.144 --> 03:48:24.625]  These are psychotic drugs, folks.
[03:48:24.625 --> 03:48:26.226]  They're not anti-psychotic drugs.
[03:48:26.226 --> 03:48:29.388]  Also, prescriptions for Prozac to kids rose 23% in one year to 83,000. 83,000!
[03:48:33.663 --> 03:48:35.244]  That's absolute insanity.
[03:48:35.244 --> 03:48:36.044]  And I pointed that out.
[03:48:36.044 --> 03:48:45.510]  Here we've got a situation where marijuana, medical marijuana, which could address the problem that is created by their vaccines, is prohibited.
[03:48:45.510 --> 03:48:51.213]  And then they inject our kids or give our kids these psychotic drugs.
[03:48:51.213 --> 03:48:56.456]  And then the update that I saw on this, last night I go home and I look and on the Daily Mail, here's this article.
[03:48:56.456 --> 03:48:59.138]  Could cannabis treat your child's epilepsy?
[03:48:59.138 --> 03:48:59.758]  Of course it could.
[03:48:59.758 --> 03:49:00.459]  We know that it can.
[03:49:00.839 --> 03:49:06.383]  Marijuana oil, they say, significantly reduces seizures in 50% of young sufferers.
[03:49:06.383 --> 03:49:08.065]  And this is a new study that's come out.
[03:49:08.065 --> 03:49:10.306]  And why are they talking about this now?
[03:49:10.306 --> 03:49:15.210]  Well, they're talking about it now because now they've patented it.
[03:49:15.210 --> 03:49:17.432]  Now they've found a way to make money.
[03:49:17.432 --> 03:49:18.412]  Because you know what, folks?
[03:49:18.412 --> 03:49:19.873]  It's all about money.
[03:49:19.873 --> 03:49:21.395]  Vaccinating you is all about money.
[03:49:21.395 --> 03:49:22.856]  It's not about your health.
[03:49:22.856 --> 03:49:26.639]  Withholding the marijuana until they can find a way to make money off of it?
[03:49:26.639 --> 03:49:27.539]  That's all about the money.
[03:49:27.539 --> 03:49:28.780]  It's not about your health.
[03:49:28.780 --> 03:49:29.301]  The FDA?
[03:49:30.538 --> 03:49:37.023]  Setting up this drug protocol, it's all about protecting the drug companies, it's not about protecting your health.
[03:49:37.023 --> 03:49:37.984]  It's all about that.
[03:49:37.984 --> 03:49:40.185]  This drug is called Epidolix.
[03:49:40.185 --> 03:49:45.689]  It's a pharmaceutical liquid form of cannabis oil.
[03:49:45.689 --> 03:49:48.471]  I'm not really a pot guy.
[03:49:48.471 --> 03:49:51.013]  A lot of people say, oh, you're just a pothead.
[03:49:51.013 --> 03:49:54.356]  No, I don't like governments that break the law.
[03:49:54.356 --> 03:49:56.397]  I don't like governments using people.
[03:49:56.397 --> 03:49:58.198]  I don't like governments abusing us.
[03:49:58.999 --> 03:50:01.981]  I don't like the war on drugs because it's unconstitutional.
[03:50:01.981 --> 03:50:03.983]  We had to have a constitutional amendment for alcohol.
[03:50:03.983 --> 03:50:08.907]  Where's the constitutional amendment for marijuana or any of the other drugs that they prohibit?
[03:50:08.907 --> 03:50:11.549]  Including our cancer treatments, okay?
[03:50:12.219 --> 03:50:19.064]  Now everything is prohibited unless expressly permitted by the Food and Drug Administration or the DEA.
[03:50:19.064 --> 03:50:21.445]  And that is a perversion, folks.
[03:50:21.445 --> 03:50:22.926]  It is a perversion.
[03:50:22.926 --> 03:50:24.027]  But that's what it's all about.
[03:50:24.027 --> 03:50:25.388]  It's all about the money.
[03:50:25.388 --> 03:50:38.417]  So now that they can find a way to patent marijuana and cannabis oil, now they'll tell you that it can help your child with epileptic seizures that are caused by their mandated vaccines.
[03:50:38.417 --> 03:50:39.378]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[03:51:00.430 --> 03:51:03.973]  We've had an amazing year here at Supernatural Silver.
[03:51:03.973 --> 03:51:10.318]  We've truly enjoyed the fantastic response from thousands of people as they've tried our extraordinary product.

[03:51:55.677 --> 03:51:59.119]  From all of us here at SupernaturalSilver.com.
[03:52:00.117 --> 03:52:03.300]  We have been fighting this war tirelessly with you at our side.
[03:52:03.300 --> 03:52:04.781]  Day in and day out.
[03:52:04.781 --> 03:52:08.464]  Exposing the ludicrous lies and criminal operations of the Globalists.
[03:52:08.464 --> 03:52:10.786]  And we're starting to see big effects.
[03:52:10.786 --> 03:52:12.687]  And the word is getting out.
[03:52:12.687 --> 03:52:14.769]  The Globalists want to make us dependent.
[03:52:14.769 --> 03:52:18.492]  And as Napoleon famously said, an army marches on its stomach.
[03:52:18.492 --> 03:52:22.315]  Ammunition, food and supplies form the backbone of any offensive.
[03:52:22.315 --> 03:52:23.976]  Including the Info War.
[03:52:23.976 --> 03:52:26.919]  And our enemies admit they're losing the Info War.
[03:52:27.179 --> 03:52:30.924]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[03:52:30.924 --> 03:52:37.432]  With this in mind, we have held strong to our principles and the decision to refuse any money from globalists or government.
[03:52:37.432 --> 03:52:44.180]  We are funding our crusade against tyranny the old-fashioned way, with pure free-market, free-will capitalism.
[03:52:44.420 --> 03:52:54.150]  Visit InfoWarsTore.com today or call 888-253-3139 and take advantage of free shipping right through December 18th and get your order before Christmas.

[03:52:59.881 --> 03:53:03.002]  Still wondering what to get that special someone that has everything?
[03:53:03.002 --> 03:53:13.164]  At ID Stronghold, we still find that a huge percentage of people do not yet have an RFID blocking wallet or purse to protect them from the new and growing threat of electronic pickpocketing.
[03:53:13.164 --> 03:53:26.487]  That's right, even though 40% of all new chipped payment cards shipped in 2014 contain a wireless interface called RFID that allows the account information to be skimmed by a thief passing near your cards, most people are still unprotected.
[03:53:26.867 --> 03:53:32.610]  The good news is that ID Stronghold makes luxurious leather wallets and other products that prevent this.
[03:53:32.610 --> 03:53:41.575]  ID Stronghold founded the entire RFID protection industry and has been protecting the RFID chips in government and military ID cards for over a decade.
[03:53:41.575 --> 03:53:47.519]  So go to idstronghold.com and get that loved one a stylish leather RFID blocking wallet or clutch.
[03:53:47.519 --> 03:53:49.240]  That's idstronghold.com.
[03:53:49.560 --> 03:53:52.404]  After all, wallets and purses have always been a great gift.
[03:53:52.404 --> 03:53:54.627]  Now, they are an even better gift.
[03:53:54.627 --> 03:53:56.429]  Visit IDStronghold.com today.
[03:54:14.272 --> 03:54:15.493]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:15.493 --> 03:54:15.993]  I'm David Knight.
[03:54:15.993 --> 03:54:19.994]  I've got several articles I want to run through here real quickly in this last segment here.
[03:54:19.994 --> 03:54:23.396]  A lot of different subjects that we haven't talked about for quite some time.
[03:54:23.396 --> 03:54:27.638]  Before we do, real quickly, I want to tell you about our specials today on this December 11th.
[03:54:27.638 --> 03:54:29.358]  We have, of course, free shipping.
[03:54:29.358 --> 03:54:32.580]  That is the biggest special we've got going at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:54:32.580 --> 03:54:33.820]  But we've got other specials as well.
[03:54:33.820 --> 03:54:36.521]  We've got 28% off of a cleansing pack.

[03:54:39.643 --> 03:54:41.383]  We have Winter Sun, Vitamin D3, 15% off.
[03:54:43.104 --> 03:54:44.105]  We have coffee.
[03:54:44.105 --> 03:54:45.186]  We've got a special on coffee.
[03:54:45.186 --> 03:54:48.348]  Buy two bags and get an Info Wars mug for free.
[03:54:48.348 --> 03:54:49.329]  Great Christmas gift.
[03:54:49.329 --> 03:54:54.873]  That's our 100% organic, non-GMO, grown without pesticides, Wake Up America coffee.
[03:54:54.873 --> 03:54:55.934]  Gourmet coffee.

[03:55:09.605 --> 03:55:12.728]  Now going to a quick news roundup that we've got here.
[03:55:12.728 --> 03:55:18.072]  There's a story, NPR talks about Bernie Sanders and how he has stuck to the same message for 40 years.
[03:55:18.072 --> 03:55:19.333]  And what would that message be?
[03:55:19.333 --> 03:55:24.258]  The message would be that we have a rigged economy.
[03:55:24.258 --> 03:55:25.379]  He wants to give us one that is
[03:55:25.979 --> 03:55:27.019]  Completely rigged.
[03:55:27.019 --> 03:55:28.620]  It's called socialism, folks.
[03:55:28.620 --> 03:55:33.222]  It's where somebody else makes all the decisions for you, and you have no input whatsoever.
[03:55:33.222 --> 03:55:42.545]  You know, Bernie Sanders loved the Nicaraguan Sandinistas, you know, and this message that he's had for the last 40 years is pure BS.
[03:55:42.545 --> 03:55:44.346]  It's pure Bernie Sandinista.
[03:55:45.046 --> 03:55:47.389]  It's exactly, that's what socialism is.
[03:55:47.389 --> 03:55:50.233]  It is nothing, he talks about unfair distribution of wealth.
[03:55:50.233 --> 03:55:53.297]  Look, he's going to distribute the wealth, okay?
[03:55:53.297 --> 03:55:59.265]  He's going to make the decisions who has money, who doesn't, because he's all going to do it from his little central location.
[03:55:59.265 --> 03:56:00.767]  No, in a free market,
[03:56:01.860 --> 03:56:07.166]  We need to be looking at ways to actually get a free market instead of the crony capitalism that we know exists now.
[03:56:07.166 --> 03:56:08.928]  And how does crony capitalism work?
[03:56:08.928 --> 03:56:13.853]  Well, you don't have crony capitalism unless you give the government control over certain things.
[03:56:13.853 --> 03:56:17.257]  So if the government were to just act as a referee, you wouldn't have crony capitalism.
[03:56:17.257 --> 03:56:19.299]  The government enables crony capitalism.
[03:56:19.299 --> 03:56:23.784]  But he wants to use that then as a problem, just as we always see with the Democrats, to take it to the next level.
[03:56:24.264 --> 03:56:29.668]  And he says, well, because we have unfair income distribution, I'm going to redistribute it.
[03:56:29.668 --> 03:56:31.129]  And you're not going to have a say-so.
[03:56:31.129 --> 03:56:35.852]  You're not going to get to decide what you're going to buy, who you're going to buy it from, and what quantities you're going to buy it from.
[03:56:35.852 --> 03:56:38.514]  Yeah, we'll call that Obamacare, for example, okay?
[03:56:38.514 --> 03:56:39.574]  So he wants to do that everywhere.
[03:56:39.574 --> 03:56:41.876]  He wants to give everybody a free college education.
[03:56:42.496 --> 03:56:46.078]  Even people who aren't from this country get a free college education.
[03:56:46.078 --> 03:56:47.338]  Somebody's going to pay for it.
[03:56:47.338 --> 03:56:48.199]  You'll pay for it.
[03:56:48.199 --> 03:56:50.400]  You'll pay for it by losing your home.
[03:56:50.400 --> 03:56:56.883]  Another thing that's, of course, on the horizon here is this decision about net neutrality.
[03:56:56.883 --> 03:56:58.363]  And we can talk about net neutrality.
[03:56:58.363 --> 03:57:01.064]  Of course, the FCC has been on the side, both sides of this issue.
[03:57:01.064 --> 03:57:02.665]  It's really not about net neutrality at all.
[03:57:02.665 --> 03:57:06.307]  It's really about who's going to have control of the Internet.
[03:57:06.307 --> 03:57:08.148]  And what does it boil down to is this.
[03:57:08.928 --> 03:57:26.899]  We've got a trial that's going on right now in a district court, a federal district court, and it's really three unaccountable, unelected judges in this district court versus three out of five unelected, unaccountable FCC commissioners who want to make the internet their new little empire zone.
[03:57:27.611 --> 03:57:31.092]  And we remember that when they first came to court, the court turned them down once before.
[03:57:31.092 --> 03:57:33.333]  Said, no, you can't regulate the Internet, it's content.
[03:57:33.333 --> 03:57:35.733]  So then the FCC went back and said, you know what?
[03:57:35.733 --> 03:57:38.374]  We just declared the Internet to be a utility.
[03:57:38.374 --> 03:57:40.515]  And the court said, okay, you can do that.
[03:57:40.515 --> 03:57:43.015]  But now they're looking at it and they said, but wait a minute.
[03:57:43.015 --> 03:57:46.816]  You've got different rules for wireless and for wired aspects of the Internet.
[03:57:46.816 --> 03:57:48.437]  So now they're trying to work out that.
[03:57:48.437 --> 03:57:51.698]  They're trying to figure out how many angels there are in the head of that pen.
[03:57:52.757 --> 03:57:57.963]  We need to get past the idea that three judges can decide the Internet for us.
[03:57:57.963 --> 03:57:59.204]  And here's the kicker.
[03:57:59.204 --> 03:58:00.125]  The very first judge.
[03:58:00.125 --> 03:58:01.988]  This is a Washington Post story when they talked about this.
[03:58:01.988 --> 03:58:04.370]  Three judges hold the fate of the Internet in their hands.
[03:58:04.370 --> 03:58:05.552]  That's the headline.
[03:58:05.552 --> 03:58:11.078]  The first judge, and I can't even pronounce his name, Sri Srinivasanarayan.
[03:58:11.078 --> 03:58:11.678]  He's from India.
[03:58:12.455 --> 03:58:15.238]  We got H-1B visa judges coming down.
[03:58:15.238 --> 03:58:19.422]  They say he is reportedly on the Democrat Party's short list for Supreme Court nominees.
[03:58:19.422 --> 03:58:20.443]  He's worked for the Bushes.
[03:58:20.443 --> 03:58:21.384]  He's worked for Exxon.
[03:58:21.384 --> 03:58:23.225]  Of course, both sides love him.
[03:58:23.225 --> 03:58:24.767]  He's not even an American citizen.
[03:58:24.767 --> 03:58:26.268]  He's going to decide the Internet for you.
[03:58:26.268 --> 03:58:28.531]  That's the kind of trouble we're in.
[03:58:28.531 --> 03:58:29.291]  Stay with us tonight.
[03:58:29.291 --> 03:58:32.374]  We're going to have the InfoWars Nightly News at 7 Central, 8 p.m.
[03:58:32.374 --> 03:58:32.695]  Eastern.

[03:58:33.896 --> 03:58:35.117]  That's it for our radio program.
