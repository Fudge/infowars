[00:00.000 --> 00:13.320]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[00:13.320 --> 00:20.840]  he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas
[00:20.840 --> 00:26.720]  alex jones kelly barusi is the head of policy at the department of homeland
[00:26.720 --> 00:31.320]  security she testified yesterday and there's a bunch of it there's over an
[00:31.320 --> 00:35.120]  hour of this but she couldn't answer any of the questions and they basically
[00:35.120 --> 00:40.000]  admit that they're just letting people in not doing basic screening but don't
[00:40.000 --> 00:44.120]  worry the NSA is surveilling everything we're doing and major whistleblowers
[00:44.120 --> 00:48.440]  have gone public they were ordered not to go after the very mosque and the very
[00:48.440 --> 00:53.520]  people who reportedly attacked in San Bernardino last week so let's play a
[00:53.520 --> 00:57.000]  few minutes of this we'll go to break and come back with more on this live
[00:57.000 --> 01:01.200]  friday edition earlier this week the chairman of the homeland security
[01:01.200 --> 01:04.600]  committee gave an important speech where he talked about extremist groups
[01:04.600 --> 01:09.040]  terrorist groups are trying to exploit the refugee program so like mr. Russell
[01:09.040 --> 01:12.240]  just a few minutes ago I would like to see if you can give us some numbers just
[01:12.240 --> 01:16.160]  just so that this committee and the american people have this information
[01:16.160 --> 01:21.040]  how many Syrian refugees have entered the United States in the last year so I
[01:21.040 --> 01:25.640]  didn't bring any of my any of the refugee numbers with me because I was
[01:25.640 --> 01:31.000]  prepared to talk about visa waiver but I can certainly have us send that to you
[01:31.000 --> 01:36.040]  you know how many Americans have traveled to Syria in the last year I
[01:36.040 --> 01:40.720]  don't have that number on me either so you wouldn't know how many Americans
[01:40.720 --> 01:47.600]  have traveled and then returned I don't have that number on me how many visa
[01:47.600 --> 01:53.640]  waiver program overstays are there currently in the United States sorry I
[01:53.640 --> 01:59.000]  didn't bring that number with me miss barisi when I look at the witness list
[01:59.000 --> 02:03.840]  you got the longest title deputy assistant secretary screening coordination
[02:03.840 --> 02:07.320]  office of policy department of homeland security you got the longest title and
[02:07.320 --> 02:11.360]  it says screening coordination now what is that court what are you what are you
[02:11.360 --> 02:15.080]  what screening are you coordinating is that just intra agency or is that
[02:15.080 --> 02:21.200]  inter agency it's both it's both so it's all that I could coordinate across the
[02:21.200 --> 02:24.880]  adjust components and the two biggest issues right now that we're that we're
[02:24.880 --> 02:27.960]  dealing with relatively we had these terrible tragedies terrible terrorist
[02:27.960 --> 02:32.160]  attacks and we're talking about the refugee issue and the visa waiver
[02:32.160 --> 02:37.000]  program mission you can't give us any numbers on either program so I was came
[02:37.000 --> 02:40.400]  prepared to talk about the visa waiver program I just asked you how many visa
[02:40.400 --> 02:45.800]  waiver program overstays are there and you said you don't know sir I don't have
[02:45.800 --> 02:51.440]  a number visa waiver program so when I asked you how many how many visa
[02:51.440 --> 02:55.400]  overstays of the visa waiver program may have traveled to Syria before they got
[02:55.400 --> 03:03.280]  here do you know that number sir if a visa waiver program national has has a
[03:03.280 --> 03:08.560]  citizen of a visa waiver program country rather has traveled to Syria Iraq or
[03:08.560 --> 03:13.560]  conflict zone and they're considered a foreign fighter that VW I'm saying
[03:13.560 --> 03:18.160]  someone from Great Britain us someone from Great Britain comes to the United
[03:18.160 --> 03:22.480]  States on a visa waiver program and they're now an overstay do we know it
[03:22.480 --> 03:27.080]  do we know if that person who's here today maybe they're not even overstay do
[03:27.080 --> 03:31.360]  we know if that person has been to Syria before they came to the United States do
[03:31.360 --> 03:34.880]  we know that I mean I know this is what our bill that we just passed over this
[03:34.880 --> 03:38.200]  week is trying to get to I'm asking do we know that fact or that information now
[03:38.200 --> 03:43.280]  so that's why we have the IC involved and there's an intelligence assessments
[03:43.280 --> 03:48.160]  and we use I wasn't asking that I was do we know that you know the number I don't
[03:48.160 --> 03:51.720]  know the number but that's why I'm trying to we have do we have people who
[03:51.720 --> 03:55.840]  are in that category I just described come from a visa waiver program country
[03:55.840 --> 03:59.320]  may have trapped they're here today and may have been in Syria or Iraq or
[03:59.320 --> 04:04.880]  somewhere there in the last before they came here do we know that citizen of a
[04:04.880 --> 04:08.840]  VWP country has traveled to one of those areas there's a nexus to United States
[04:08.840 --> 04:12.720]  or the VWP partners shared that information with us yes we know that
[04:12.720 --> 04:17.840]  information and we will vet against it we will also use our right now could
[04:17.840 --> 04:25.440]  they be here right now is my question I don't have that answer sir all right

[04:36.480 --> 04:41.800]  criteria for that tell me can you tell me anything about that sure the no fly
[04:41.800 --> 04:47.520]  list is a subset of the overall terrorist screening database the inner
[04:47.520 --> 04:50.880]  agency works together the terror screening database is owned and operated
[04:50.880 --> 04:55.520]  by the terror screening center as I as I said earlier their criteria to get on
[04:55.520 --> 05:02.760]  that better Hillary Clinton wants to censor people who make fun of her who's

[08:31.040 --> 08:55.960]  We're interrupting your regularly scheduled program to bring you this terrifying report.
[08:55.960 --> 09:00.960]  It was almost as if it were a planned infusion. It's just pancake.
[09:00.960 --> 09:04.960]  Jane, what more can you tell us about the Salomon Brothers building and its collapse?
[09:04.960 --> 09:09.960]  New York very much a city still in chaos. The phones are not working properly.
[09:09.960 --> 09:11.960]  The subway lines are not working properly.
[09:11.960 --> 09:16.960]  The sky now black with smoke in front of us just across the Tigris River here.
[09:16.960 --> 09:21.960]  This is shock and awe, Tom, for the population of Baghdad.
[09:21.960 --> 09:23.960]  Shock and awe, indeed.
[09:23.960 --> 09:29.960]  The people you liberate will witness the honorable and decent spirit of the American military.
[09:29.960 --> 09:33.960]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[09:35.960 --> 09:39.960]  It is a big idea. A new world order.
[09:39.960 --> 09:44.960]  I love my dad. I'd kill for him. I'd go to prison for him because I love him so much.
[09:44.960 --> 09:45.960]  I love Bill Clinton.
[09:45.960 --> 09:48.960]  What does that make Hillary Clinton to the Bush family?
[09:48.960 --> 09:49.960]  My sister-in-law.
[09:49.960 --> 09:55.960]  When you are subverting the power of government, that's a fundamentally dangerous thing to democracy.
[09:55.960 --> 09:57.960]  What do you think of Edward Snowden?
[09:57.960 --> 09:58.960]  I think he's a traitor.
[09:58.960 --> 10:02.960]  Obama is the one that kills the US troops if the Russians bomb any of them.
[10:02.960 --> 10:04.960]  Obama is the one that put them in arms way.
[10:04.960 --> 10:06.960]  Obama is the one using them as human shields.
[10:06.960 --> 10:11.960]  It is the most corrupt, degenerate, criminal government in American history.
[10:11.960 --> 10:19.960]  I'm here to warn people. You keep telling me to shut up. This isn't a game.
[10:19.960 --> 10:23.960]  Welcome to America, ISIS. This is what we do.
[10:23.960 --> 10:26.960]  We got people that have taken your asses out in this building right now.
[10:26.960 --> 10:29.960]  We're armed to the teeth and we're not scared. You got that, you sons of bitches.
[10:29.960 --> 10:32.960]  In 2012, your agency was saying, quote,
[10:32.960 --> 10:38.960]  the Salafists, the Muslim Brotherhood and al-Qaeda in Iraq are the major forces driving the insurgents in Syria.
[10:38.960 --> 10:43.960]  In 2012, the US was helping coordinate arms transfers to those same groups.
[10:43.960 --> 10:45.960]  And why did you not stop that?
[10:45.960 --> 10:47.960]  Why didn't you come forward before? What were you waiting for?
[10:47.960 --> 10:51.960]  Well, for you, Inspector, I needed you.
[10:57.960 --> 11:03.960]  I suddenly had this feeling that everything was connected. We're all part of it.
[11:03.960 --> 11:08.960]  Are we ready for it?
[11:10.960 --> 11:15.960]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[11:19.960 --> 11:25.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday, December 11th, 2015.
[11:25.960 --> 11:31.960]  I'm your host, Alex Jones. We're going to be live here for the next three hours and 50-plus minutes.
[11:31.960 --> 11:34.960]  We now, of course, have added the fourth hour.
[11:34.960 --> 11:39.960]  David Knight will be hosting today with a lot of breaking news and analysis in the fourth hour.
[11:39.960 --> 11:43.960]  Alex Newman, reporter for the New American Magazine and the John Birch Society,
[11:43.960 --> 11:47.960]  will be reporting from on the ground for 30 minutes with us at the start of the next hour
[11:47.960 --> 11:52.960]  at the Key Global Government Conference that we've been covering for the last two weeks
[11:52.960 --> 11:57.960]  that wraps up reportedly at the end of this weekend with a serious global government treaty,
[11:57.960 --> 12:01.960]  the most egregious ever seen publicly. A lot of it is also secret.
[12:01.960 --> 12:09.960]  He'll be joining us from Paris. Mike Norris, filmmaker, documentary filmmaker,
[12:09.960 --> 12:15.960]  one of the, of course, directors on a lot of Chuck Norris' movies, son of Chuck Norris,
[12:15.960 --> 12:19.960]  will be joining us in studio popping in today.
[12:19.960 --> 12:26.960]  He invited me with others earlier this year to be part of a pretty high-budget movie.
[12:26.960 --> 12:33.960]  Comparatively speaking, to expose the globalist one-world government agenda.
[12:33.960 --> 12:39.960]  And so I'm honored to be part of the film, and we're going to be premiering the trailer
[12:39.960 --> 12:45.960]  for the documentary. I call it a documentary.
[12:45.960 --> 12:51.960]  It's a fiction piece, but it really documents what the globalist plan is overall.
[12:51.960 --> 12:57.960]  So it's a little bit tongue-in-cheek statement coming up at the bottom of the second hour today,
[12:57.960 --> 13:03.960]  and we will premiere that trailer. It will also be up on infowars.com
[13:03.960 --> 13:07.960]  and prisonplanet.com will premiere the trailer, tell you the name of the film,
[13:07.960 --> 13:10.960]  and a lot more when he joins us in studio.
[13:10.960 --> 13:17.960]  And then, of course, as I said, David Knight coming up.
[13:17.960 --> 13:21.960]  A lot of times this happens to me, but as I've said many times in the past,
[13:21.960 --> 13:25.960]  it would only happen a couple times a year.
[13:25.960 --> 13:31.960]  Now it's happening every couple days, sometimes several times per day,
[13:31.960 --> 13:35.960]  where I'm looking at admissions, I'm looking at government statements,
[13:35.960 --> 13:40.960]  I'm looking at confirmed info.
[13:40.960 --> 13:47.960]  And it's so over the top that I can't believe that it isn't bringing
[13:47.960 --> 13:51.960]  this criminal government completely down and restoring our republic.
[13:51.960 --> 13:55.960]  We've seen the former head of defense intelligence and three other generals
[13:55.960 --> 14:00.960]  in the last two months, two and a half months, go public and say,
[14:00.960 --> 14:04.960]  our government created ISIS. We've been ordered to support them.
[14:04.960 --> 14:07.960]  We've been ordered to fund them. It's horrible. It's illegal. It's criminal.
[14:07.960 --> 14:11.960]  I don't know why the president's doing this. It's hurting US interest.
[14:11.960 --> 14:16.960]  It's immoral. And then you see the Huffington Post and New York Magazine
[14:16.960 --> 14:19.960]  and the New York Times and the LA Times and it's the headline.
[14:19.960 --> 14:24.960]  Top generals say we screwed up and helped create ISIS.
[14:24.960 --> 14:29.960]  No, there was no screwing up. These generals have said specifically
[14:29.960 --> 14:33.960]  they were ordered to do this and it was wrong.
[14:33.960 --> 14:41.960]  That alone is just so nakedly sensational that it makes my head spin.
[14:41.960 --> 14:45.960]  There's the headline, former DI director, US made willful decision
[14:45.960 --> 14:49.960]  to support ISIS in Syria. And why is that important?
[14:49.960 --> 14:52.960]  Well, it's not just immoral. It's not just evil. It's not just wrong.
[14:52.960 --> 15:00.960]  It doesn't just destabilize things, but they've been caught doing it.
[15:00.960 --> 15:03.960]  And where are the congressional hearings?
[15:03.960 --> 15:06.960]  Well, most of the Republican leadership is involved in all this,
[15:06.960 --> 15:10.960]  just as much as Obama is. Just as much as Hillary is.
[15:10.960 --> 15:13.960]  Well, not as much as Hillary. She actually ran herself hands-on,
[15:13.960 --> 15:16.960]  so that's not correct. No one's more involved than Hillary. Excuse me.
[15:16.960 --> 15:23.960]  Just a fact.
[15:23.960 --> 15:28.960]  So we have General Michael Flynn, all these others coming out.
[15:28.960 --> 15:33.960]  And then I have articles like this one out of Defense One putting out
[15:33.960 --> 15:39.960]  disinfo to the public saying, look, the US is funding billions to fight ISIS.
[15:39.960 --> 15:43.960]  And then it lists the groups and almost every group on there
[15:43.960 --> 15:47.960]  is admittedly running and funding and giving the weapons to ISIS,
[15:47.960 --> 15:55.960]  including Saudi Arabia, that just got $24 billion since last year.
[15:55.960 --> 16:01.960]  This is truly sick.
[16:01.960 --> 16:06.960]  This is how illiterate politically the public is that they could get away
[16:06.960 --> 16:09.960]  with stuff like this. I mean, this is crazy.
[16:09.960 --> 16:13.960]  And I can't believe, where are the so-called liberals?
[16:13.960 --> 16:16.960]  I mean, if George Bush was trying stuff like this, they would have been
[16:16.960 --> 16:19.960]  pulling their hair out and running down the street naked screaming,
[16:19.960 --> 16:22.960]  and they should have. Bush was doing some really bad stuff,
[16:22.960 --> 16:25.960]  and I was against it, and I was speaking out against it,
[16:25.960 --> 16:28.960]  and was called a communist by neocon publications.
[16:28.960 --> 16:30.960]  I'm not a communist. I'm an American.
[16:30.960 --> 16:33.960]  I don't support war crimes. I don't support destabilizing countries
[16:33.960 --> 16:38.960]  and overthrowing our allies and mass murdering people
[16:38.960 --> 16:41.960]  and torture and all the rest of it,
[16:41.960 --> 16:48.960]  because none of it's done to begin with the protect us and its immoral.
[16:48.960 --> 16:51.960]  Now, I say that because that's just one example of a story this year
[16:51.960 --> 16:53.960]  that's so naked.
[16:53.960 --> 16:56.960]  We now have these reports from, again, the Daily Caller.
[16:56.960 --> 17:00.960]  We had Tucker Carlson on yesterday, and I was real nice to him,
[17:00.960 --> 17:03.960]  and some people emailed me or asked me how he used to bash Tucker Carlson
[17:03.960 --> 17:07.960]  when he was at MSNBC and then Summit Fox.
[17:07.960 --> 17:11.960]  Well, that's because he was more of a mainline libertarian conservative then.
[17:11.960 --> 17:16.960]  The work he does at Daily Caller is really groundbreaking every day.
[17:16.960 --> 17:21.960]  And so, if it's said, I admire the Daily Caller, and I admire his reporters,
[17:21.960 --> 17:24.960]  and I admire him getting more hardcore.
[17:24.960 --> 17:27.960]  We got to get to the point where when people start coming over to our side
[17:27.960 --> 17:30.960]  and start to get more realistic and start to get more bold,
[17:30.960 --> 17:35.960]  to not then just run them off because some time back in the past, they weren't perfect.
[17:35.960 --> 17:38.960]  I'm here to win this war against the globalist,
[17:38.960 --> 17:44.960]  not sit up here like a Pharisee or some pontiff who's arrogantly saying,
[17:44.960 --> 17:48.960]  I have all the answers and everybody else can just go to hell.
[17:48.960 --> 17:52.960]  I used to be ignorant, folks, 20-plus years ago.
[17:52.960 --> 17:57.960]  I was a mainline Republican slash libertarian.
[17:57.960 --> 18:02.960]  But Ron Paul was my radicalizer to a great extent,
[18:02.960 --> 18:06.960]  and look, I'm radical compared to Ron Paul today.
[18:06.960 --> 18:09.960]  And yes, we are radicalizing Donald Trump.
[18:09.960 --> 18:12.960]  I'll just leave it at that.
[18:12.960 --> 18:14.960]  I'm not going to give the Washington Post, the New York Times,
[18:14.960 --> 18:19.960]  or others who've been calling me a quote on inside baseball,
[18:19.960 --> 18:21.960]  but I'm here to win.
[18:21.960 --> 18:26.960]  I'm here to take action.
[18:26.960 --> 18:29.960]  I'm here to try to really set brush fires in the minds of men and women
[18:29.960 --> 18:31.960]  to want to have liberty.
[18:31.960 --> 18:33.960]  And did I like the Donald Trump 10 years ago?
[18:33.960 --> 18:34.960]  Not so much.
[18:34.960 --> 18:35.960]  I liked the one of the day, yes.
[18:35.960 --> 18:37.960]  And it's a process of waking people up.
[18:37.960 --> 18:39.960]  The climate has changed.
[18:39.960 --> 18:41.960]  People are choosing sides right now.
[18:41.960 --> 18:46.960]  And we've got to basically realize we could defeat the globalist.
[18:46.960 --> 18:49.960]  We could overthrow their system and restore freedom.
[18:49.960 --> 18:53.960]  But the bottom paid for churches and government systems tell you
[18:53.960 --> 18:55.960]  things are only going to get worse.
[18:55.960 --> 18:56.960]  It's a foregone conclusion.
[18:56.960 --> 18:57.960]  Submit to tyranny.
[18:57.960 --> 18:59.960]  That's the way it is.
[18:59.960 --> 19:01.960]  Assume a fetal position.
[19:01.960 --> 19:02.960]  Stick a thumb in your mouth.
[19:02.960 --> 19:04.960]  Stick the other one someplace else.
[19:04.960 --> 19:06.960]  That should be the new national flag.
[19:06.960 --> 19:08.960]  A person in a fetal position sucking their thumb
[19:08.960 --> 19:10.960]  and sitting on the other one.
[19:10.960 --> 19:12.960]  With a pink rainbow.
[19:12.960 --> 19:14.960]  And Caitlyn Jenner.
[19:14.960 --> 19:18.960]  Wasting the flag on a pile of dead babies at Planned Parenthood.
[19:18.960 --> 19:21.960]  I mean, seriously, this is not who we are.
[19:21.960 --> 19:24.960]  All we've got to do is advertise the Americana culture
[19:24.960 --> 19:28.960]  that's still there up against this globalist death culture
[19:28.960 --> 19:29.960]  and it's game over.
[19:29.960 --> 19:30.960]  People want prosperity.
[19:30.960 --> 19:32.960]  They want freedom.
[19:32.960 --> 19:34.960]  They want men to be men, women to be women.
[19:34.960 --> 19:36.960]  They want people to have fun.
[19:36.960 --> 19:39.960]  Work hard, play hard to quote Ted Nugent.
[19:39.960 --> 19:42.960]  That's what folks want and we're sick of it.
[19:42.960 --> 19:46.960]  Women want men that wear pants.
[19:46.960 --> 19:48.960]  Real simple stuff like that.
[19:48.960 --> 19:49.960]  And those are Trump cards.
[19:49.960 --> 19:50.960]  Nobody can beat them.
[19:50.960 --> 19:51.960]  We come back.
[19:51.960 --> 19:53.960]  Mega bombshell whistleblowers
[19:53.960 --> 19:55.960]  on what we already knew about San Bernardino.
[19:55.960 --> 19:59.960]  But now it's confirmed this is big.
[19:59.960 --> 20:01.960]  911, what is your emergency?

[21:36.960 --> 21:39.960]  balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.

[21:59.960 --> 22:01.960]  We've all heard the news stories.

[22:24.960 --> 22:48.960]  InfidelBodyArmor just won't quit.
[22:55.960 --> 23:01.960]  My name is Bill Bonner and I have an important message.
[23:01.960 --> 23:04.960]  Right now, the highest levels of government
[23:04.960 --> 23:07.960]  are struggling against an inevitable crisis,
[23:07.960 --> 23:09.960]  but they're about to lose control.
[23:09.960 --> 23:12.960]  When this happens, it will rip our country apart
[23:12.960 --> 23:14.960]  in ways you never imagined,
[23:14.960 --> 23:17.960]  from where we shop to the doctors you visit
[23:17.960 --> 23:19.960]  and the family you want to protect.
[23:19.960 --> 23:21.960]  Look, I've made predictions like this before.
[23:21.960 --> 23:25.960]  A few years ago, I warned that the housing prices would collapse.
[23:25.960 --> 23:29.960]  Before that, I warned that.com companies would crash,
[23:29.960 --> 23:30.960]  and they did.
[23:30.960 --> 23:33.960]  Those who listened had a chance to save themselves,
[23:33.960 --> 23:35.960]  but this has nothing to do with the stock market.
[23:35.960 --> 23:37.960]  This will affect us all.
[23:37.960 --> 23:42.960]  I've posted a free video at dollardanger.com.
[23:42.960 --> 23:44.960]  Maybe you'll disagree with my conclusions,
[23:44.960 --> 23:46.960]  but first you need to watch this video
[23:46.960 --> 23:48.960]  and see the facts for yourself.
[23:48.960 --> 23:51.960]  You can watch the video for free right now
[23:51.960 --> 23:54.960]  by going to dollardanger.com.
[23:54.960 --> 24:19.960]  Again, that's dollardanger.com.
[24:24.960 --> 24:29.960]  And today it rings true than ever,
[24:29.960 --> 24:32.960]  because truth is bulletproof.
[24:32.960 --> 24:35.960]  Truth is eternal.
[24:35.960 --> 24:39.960]  Truth stands on its own, evergreen,
[24:39.960 --> 24:43.960]  throughout all times, all dimensions.
[24:43.960 --> 24:47.960]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[24:47.960 --> 24:48.960]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[24:48.960 --> 24:49.960]  We're shifting it around.
[24:49.960 --> 24:56.360]  Shifting it around, Mike Norris is going to be here in the third hour today, announcing
[24:56.360 --> 25:01.640]  and premiering a trailer for a new anti-New World Order film that he and others have produced.
[25:01.640 --> 25:06.920]  But before we go there and break all that down, and before we get into the latest huge
[25:06.920 --> 25:13.200]  whistleblower news that's as big as Benghazi, as big as any of these events, for what it
[25:13.200 --> 25:17.480]  exposes, the big breaking news right now is anonymous.
[25:17.480 --> 25:23.600]  Those after Donald Trump, and people have always asked me, am I for anonymous or against
[25:23.600 --> 25:24.600]  it?
[25:24.600 --> 25:25.600]  Well, it's anonymous.
[25:25.600 --> 25:29.160]  Like saying, am I for people wearing masks on their faces or I'm against it?
[25:29.160 --> 25:31.600]  No, sometimes I'd be for it, sometimes I'm against it.
[25:31.600 --> 25:33.840]  Are there good groups calling themselves anonymous?
[25:33.840 --> 25:35.840]  Are there bad groups?
[25:35.840 --> 25:36.840]  Yes.
[25:36.840 --> 25:41.400]  Overall, I think most work that's been done by anonymous, which is just the people, it's
[25:41.400 --> 25:46.680]  not an organization, folks kind of think of it as a group of people in a bunker somewhere.
[25:46.680 --> 25:50.440]  Most of what I've seen anonymous do has been good, but it's also something governments
[25:50.440 --> 25:54.440]  and corrupt corporations use to do things.
[25:54.440 --> 25:58.080]  Donald Trump's website's been taken down, there's all these calls for censorship against
[25:58.080 --> 26:02.320]  him, there's these calls for banning him to going to Europe, there's calls to kill him,
[26:02.320 --> 26:08.480]  ACLU officials have called for killing Trump voters, this is all in my stack today.
[26:08.480 --> 26:13.320]  All he's called for is what Jimmy Carter did, he didn't say like Franklin Delano Roosevelt
[26:13.320 --> 26:17.600]  said, round up all the Japanese, round up all the Muslims, I'd be against that if he said
[26:17.600 --> 26:22.560]  that, but as you're going to see with these whistleblowers, they were in that mosque,
[26:22.560 --> 26:26.360]  they were targeting Farouk and Malik.
[26:26.360 --> 26:30.680]  That's the breaking news, they knew the training camp she'd gone to, they tried to stop her
[26:30.680 --> 26:34.840]  getting back in and did you know it got killed from the White House?
[26:34.840 --> 26:40.440]  That's Homeland Security and FBI whistleblowers today, should be the number one story in the
[26:40.440 --> 26:41.440]  country.
[26:41.440 --> 26:46.120]  I'm going to direct my reporters to get on this, work on whatever else you want, but
[26:46.120 --> 26:51.680]  I rarely say, hey, get on this, we need to be reporting on and ferreting in to what daily
[26:51.680 --> 26:54.360]  caller is getting into.
[26:54.360 --> 26:58.720]  But separately, oh, you're so proud of yourself, Karim Abdul-Jabbar says he's helping ISIS
[26:58.720 --> 27:04.920]  when he's fighting it, oh, the fake Rick Ross jail guard that prays on black people for
[27:04.920 --> 27:10.160]  MTV, Rick Ross, the fake one, you know, says kill Trump, oh, you're so hard when you weren't
[27:10.160 --> 27:13.800]  you know, locking black people up, you're so cool, now you teach them how to be thugs
[27:13.800 --> 27:19.960]  so you can lock them up again, you work for the man, don't you Judas, go big old fat punk,
[27:19.960 --> 27:25.600]  Rick Ross, steals people's identities, big old, nobody, excuse me, I don't want to go
[27:25.600 --> 27:31.440]  off into a rant, he just makes me sick, kill Trump, he gets away with that, he's a scumbag.
[27:31.440 --> 27:38.800]  See, Rick Ross locks black people up, Donald Trump buys golf courses and opens them up
[27:38.800 --> 27:43.880]  to black people, but that's the difference, see, Obama doubles black unemployment, Donald
[27:43.880 --> 27:48.840]  Trump wants to boost black employment, so he gets a big old government thug like the
[27:48.840 --> 27:54.120]  fake Rick Ross to call for killing him, because he's a little punk fake gangster, see how this
[27:54.120 --> 27:59.400]  turns out for a punk, excuse me, I'm really getting angry, anonymous goes after Donald
[27:59.400 --> 28:07.920]  Trump, what do you mean the Democratic Party, Republican Party, hacker collective anonymous,
[28:07.920 --> 28:13.840]  the media wants to act like this is a collective against Trump, seems to be targeting Republican
[28:13.840 --> 28:18.000]  presidential candidate, Donald Trump after the real estate tycoon called for a ban on
[28:18.000 --> 28:23.200]  all Muslims entering the United States, oh get the full quote, until they check the visas
[28:23.200 --> 28:29.280]  and verify them and anybody else who hadn't been checked, but it's all out of context,
[28:29.280 --> 28:33.200]  one of the Twitter accounts for the hacker group said that it briefly took down Trump
[28:33.200 --> 28:40.520]  tower, New York City dot com earlier and the group has also seemingly posted a YouTube
[28:40.520 --> 28:46.120]  video warning Trump, yeah you mean they use the same video that people have been using
[28:46.120 --> 28:51.200]  for five years that somebody else cut and put your words over it, sitting there saying
[28:51.200 --> 28:55.320]  you better watch it, you better do what we say, I mean this is a sick joke and the media
[28:55.320 --> 28:59.800]  again acts like it's a hack to this community all together, it's just somebody claiming
[28:59.800 --> 29:04.080]  they're with anonymous, which again is a cut out, let's go to the warning from anonymous,
[29:04.080 --> 29:05.080]  here it is.
[29:05.080 --> 29:10.360]  For anonymous, Donald Trump, it has come to our attention that you want to ban all Muslims
[29:10.360 --> 29:15.560]  to enter the United States, this policy is going to have a huge impact, this is what
[29:15.560 --> 29:21.160]  ISIS wants, the more Muslims feel sad, the more ISIS feel that they can recruit them,
[29:21.160 --> 29:26.080]  the more United States appears to be targeting Muslims not just radical Muslims, you can
[29:26.080 --> 29:30.720]  be sure that ISIS would put that up on their social media campaign, Donald Trump think
[29:30.720 --> 29:36.560]  twice before you speak anything, you have been warned Mr. Donald Trump, we are anonymous,
[29:36.560 --> 29:39.840]  we are legion, we do not forgive, expect us.
[29:39.840 --> 29:44.880]  We're going to break, that is a direct White House line that he's helping ISIS, that was
[29:44.880 --> 29:49.560]  probably produced by the White House, what a group of cowardly filth.
[29:49.560 --> 30:00.280]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:00.280 --> 30:04.600]  A recent hearing on climate change featuring three prominent scientists who are actually
[30:04.600 --> 30:10.080]  skeptical of manmade global warming resulted in a heated exchange, Massachusetts Senator
[30:10.080 --> 30:16.960]  Ed Markey invoked Galileo when he harped the science is settled, essentially calling climatologist
[30:16.960 --> 30:22.320]  Judith Curry a denier for believing that this could be something God made rather than something
[30:22.320 --> 30:25.760]  that is manmade and backed by science.
[30:25.760 --> 30:31.440]  Are you saying there's no natural variability Senator, we're alligators at the North Pole,
[30:31.440 --> 30:33.800]  what was that, was that you and your SUV?
[30:33.800 --> 30:38.640]  And be prepared for the climate change cult to be even more in your face, the UN announced
[30:38.640 --> 30:45.040]  the organization of a civil society PR campaign, this propaganda tsunami will be used to bolster
[30:45.040 --> 30:50.120]  the UN's climate deal, which calls for a hundred billion dollar annual transfer from
[30:50.120 --> 30:55.880]  rich to poor nations, and of course taxes, penalties and a global police force to guarantee
[30:55.880 --> 31:25.800]  our submission, Leigh Ann McAdder reporting for infowars.com.

[31:59.040 --> 32:00.040]  built.
[32:00.040 --> 32:03.400]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[32:03.400 --> 32:08.520]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors
[32:08.520 --> 32:11.800]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[32:11.800 --> 32:17.080]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ is backed by major clinical studies.

[32:34.760 --> 32:37.000]  the new infowarslife.com.
[32:37.000 --> 32:41.640]  Oil of oregano formulation, we have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of
[32:41.640 --> 32:47.000]  oregano oil on the market, extracted directly from the wild herb, and sealed in easy to

[32:52.120 --> 32:55.040]  in our limited first run at infowarslife.com.
[32:55.040 --> 33:06.640]  That's infowarslife.com, or call 888-253-3139 in the Councils of Government.
[33:06.640 --> 33:12.640]  In the Councils of Government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence,
[33:12.640 --> 33:18.240]  whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial conspiracy theorists.
[33:18.240 --> 33:22.440]  In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown
[33:22.440 --> 33:23.440]  Dallas.
[33:23.440 --> 33:29.440]  First report, say that President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by the shooting.
[33:29.440 --> 33:34.440]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[33:34.440 --> 33:43.440]  It was almost as if it were planned in motion, it just panicked.
[33:43.440 --> 33:50.440]  Either you were with us, or you were with the terrorists.
[33:50.440 --> 34:00.440]  Either with us, or you were with the terrorists.
[34:00.440 --> 34:05.440]  But I also believe that a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in hands of
[34:05.440 --> 34:10.440]  soldiers, not in the hands of criminals.
[34:10.440 --> 34:14.440]  Guns will be caked, and no one will be able to be armed.
[34:14.440 --> 34:18.440]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in America.
[34:18.440 --> 34:23.440]  The city's global governance at last, is it one world, the central bank is in charge,
[34:23.440 --> 34:27.440]  but aren't we all just living and dying from what the central banks do?
[34:27.440 --> 34:38.440]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[34:38.440 --> 34:43.440]  And it's Friday, the 11th of December, 2015, I am your host.
[34:43.440 --> 34:48.440]  We've got filmmaker, actor, you name it.
[34:48.440 --> 34:53.440]  Chuck Norris' son, Mike Norris joining us to launch a new big film trailer.
[34:53.440 --> 35:01.440]  The first premiere will announce the name of the film, and a lot more coming up when he joins us.
[35:01.440 --> 35:06.440]  We also have Alex Newman of the New American Magazine joining us for 30 minutes from Paris,
[35:06.440 --> 35:09.440]  France on the latest on the huge global government conference.
[35:09.440 --> 35:15.440]  And David Knight will be con-showing the fourth hour today.
[35:15.440 --> 35:21.440]  Now again, I have praised good organizations and individuals out there that have called themselves anonymous.
[35:21.440 --> 35:23.440]  The whole point is it's anonymous.
[35:23.440 --> 35:33.440]  But you have the left trying to continually act like anonymous is run by them and that they're against Donald Trump or guns or whatever.
[35:33.440 --> 35:35.440]  And that's just not the way this works.
[35:35.440 --> 35:45.440]  Snowden has come out saying more guns and citizens being armed would be the answer to San Bernardino, not NSA spying.
[35:45.440 --> 35:52.440]  And notice NSA spying didn't protect us. So here's the king daddy of what you'd call anonymous.
[35:52.440 --> 35:55.440]  And he's exposing the government.
[35:55.440 --> 35:57.440]  That, of course, is Snowden.
[35:57.440 --> 36:01.440]  Same thing to a certain extent, but not as good.
[36:01.440 --> 36:04.440]  We see Julian Assange.
[36:04.440 --> 36:07.440]  And yes, of course, Snowden is a Ron Paul supporter.
[36:07.440 --> 36:12.440]  And yes, folks, Snowden is a listener of infowars.com.
[36:12.440 --> 36:13.440]  I can just leave it at that.
[36:13.440 --> 36:18.440]  And someday you'll hear him here on this show.
[36:18.440 --> 36:19.440]  Not bragging.
[36:19.440 --> 36:20.440]  I'm just letting you know the facts.
[36:20.440 --> 36:24.440]  Vladimir Putin is a routine listener and viewer.
[36:24.440 --> 36:26.440]  Now, you know Donald Trump is Matt Drudge.
[36:26.440 --> 36:27.440]  Let's go on and on.
[36:27.440 --> 36:33.440]  Not name dropping, letting you know, because you're not well-known, most of you, that you're not alone.
[36:33.440 --> 36:34.440]  People are awake.
[36:34.440 --> 36:35.440]  They're awakening.
[36:35.440 --> 36:42.440]  Is there a large portion of people that don't know what planet they're on and can't find their rear end with both hands?
[36:42.440 --> 36:43.440]  Absolutely.
[36:43.440 --> 36:47.440]  But those are poor brainwashed victims set in front of the television from birth in there.
[36:47.440 --> 36:48.440]  You know what? Fill diapers.
[36:48.440 --> 36:52.440]  We should feel sorry for these matrix pod children.
[36:52.440 --> 36:57.440]  These proto-matrix pod children.
[36:57.440 --> 37:01.440]  Light years worse than latchkey kids living in their own fantasy world.
[37:01.440 --> 37:03.440]  We're here to break them out of the fantasy.
[37:03.440 --> 37:05.440]  We're pro-human.
[37:05.440 --> 37:07.440]  We're pro-Renaissance.
[37:07.440 --> 37:08.440]  We're pro-empowerment.
[37:08.440 --> 37:12.440]  We want the real technologies that have been developed to be deployed to the general public.
[37:12.440 --> 37:15.440]  We believe in expanding economies.
[37:15.440 --> 37:20.440]  We believe expanding economies are good, not bad for the planet, and not bad for humanity.
[37:20.440 --> 37:22.440]  We're fans of the general public.
[37:22.440 --> 37:24.440]  We believe in the knowledge of the general public.
[37:24.440 --> 37:35.440]  We know there's an artificial feedback loop to dumb down humanity that has created a bunch of servile, drooling, mindless idiots who are a danger to other humans who are not under globalist control.
[37:35.440 --> 37:51.440]  Under globalist spell, under globalist mesmerization, under globalist hypnotism, under globalist psychosis, under globalist programming with hypnotic suggestions and hypnotic trigger words.
[37:51.440 --> 37:59.440]  We are conscious, sentient beings that wish to direct our destiny, our development, our evolution.
[37:59.440 --> 38:13.440]  And they use that word because controlled Christians are even mad at the word evolution in their own political correctness, just like they're trying to ban the word lynch out of the name of buildings, saying it means lynch black people, even though it's an Irish name.
[38:13.440 --> 38:16.440]  We need to change the name then of the Attorney General.
[38:16.440 --> 38:20.440]  And by the way, I'm not joking if you just tuned in.
[38:20.440 --> 38:23.440]  I learned after yesterday that it's not just colleges, it's other facilities.
[38:23.440 --> 38:28.440]  People are saying it rid of the word lynch.
[38:28.440 --> 38:38.440]  These crybabies in Pennsylvania demand racist lynch memorial hall be renamed, not because the guy it's named after lynch was racist, but because the word lynch they associate with racism.
[38:38.440 --> 38:45.440]  No, it's with the lynch case in the U.S. with two family members hanging the sun because they thought he committed a crime.
[38:45.440 --> 38:56.440]  They passed the lynch laws against lynching, against vigilante justice that has affected whites, blacks, you name it.
[38:56.440 --> 39:00.440]  Everything becomes this mindless psychosis to where I use the word evolution.
[39:00.440 --> 39:09.440]  Cars evolve, computers evolve, infrastructure involves, architecture evolves, music evolves or devolves.
[39:09.440 --> 39:15.440]  And we're in the middle of the de-evolution of culture and society, but also a renaissance in parallel tracks.
[39:15.440 --> 39:21.440]  And when you choose renaissance, when you choose free will, when you choose true Thomas Jeffersonian liberalism,
[39:21.440 --> 39:28.440]  it trumps in spades over and over again with a royal flush.
[39:28.440 --> 39:33.440]  It delivers the dead man's hand to the globalist and brings them down.
[39:33.440 --> 39:36.440]  Your free will is the end of their tyranny.
[39:36.440 --> 39:44.440]  That's why they want politically correct obama butts bleeding like mindless sheep with no culture, no language, no ideas.
[39:44.440 --> 39:50.440]  Just waiting for the latest trendy download to become successful if they could just get the trendiness right.
[39:50.440 --> 39:59.440]  If they could just submit to the cultural Marxism correctly, then they might discover a heart, a soul, a will.
[39:59.440 --> 40:06.440]  They might discover an identity, a family, a culture, a tribe, 10 ship, because what they have is not real.
[40:06.440 --> 40:13.440]  It is plastic. It's as phony as a $3 bill.
[40:13.440 --> 40:21.440]  So Anonymous is quite proud of itself going after Donald Trump because he said we need to start screening these people coming out of these countries.
[40:21.440 --> 40:23.440]  We don't know who's radical. We don't know who isn't.
[40:23.440 --> 40:29.440]  In polls, 25% coming out of Syria say they plan Jihad or support it or support suicide bombers.
[40:29.440 --> 40:36.440]  That is dangerous. We've got to make Congress and Obama start vetting them, which Congress admits they're not doing,
[40:36.440 --> 40:39.440]  which the FBI admits and DHS admits they're not doing.
[40:39.440 --> 40:46.440]  And then they ask the head spokeswoman, let's play this clip first, Kelly Burcelli, or however you pronounce it.
[40:46.440 --> 40:54.440]  They ask her, how's the no fly list? And she says, how's it work? And she says, I know nothing.
[40:54.440 --> 40:58.440]  Well, we do know there's been investigations by the media. No one knows how you get on it.
[40:58.440 --> 41:05.440]  You can't get off of it. And bureaucrats at the DHS at the White House level direct who goes on it.
[41:05.440 --> 41:08.440]  Let's play that clip.
[41:08.440 --> 41:12.440]  Can you tell me anything about the no fly list then?
[41:12.440 --> 41:18.440]  Can't tell me anything about those. How does a person get put on the criteria for that?
[41:18.440 --> 41:20.440]  Can you tell me anything about that?
[41:20.440 --> 41:26.440]  Sure. The no fly list is a subset of the overall terrorist screening database.
[41:26.440 --> 41:33.440]  The interagency works together. The terrorist screening database is owned and operated by the terrorist screening center, as I said earlier.
[41:33.440 --> 41:38.440]  There are criteria to get on that that are agreed to.
[41:38.440 --> 41:40.440]  How many American citizens are on that list right now? Can you give me that number?
[41:40.440 --> 41:44.440]  How many American citizens are on the no fly list right now?
[41:44.440 --> 41:49.440]  I know there are American citizens on the list. It is an extremely small number, but I don't have my numbers with me.
[41:49.440 --> 41:51.440]  But again, that's something I can easily get back to you.
[41:51.440 --> 41:55.440]  Ms. Burrici, I've asked you the number of Americans who've traveled to Syria, you don't know.
[41:55.440 --> 41:58.440]  The number of Americans who may have traveled in return, you don't know.
[41:58.440 --> 42:02.440]  The number of Syrian refugees who've entered the country in the last year, you don't know.
[42:02.440 --> 42:05.440]  The number of visa waiver program overstays, you don't know.
[42:05.440 --> 42:10.440]  The number of visa waiver overstays who may have been to Syria before they came here, you don't know.
[42:10.440 --> 42:13.440]  And the number of American citizens on the no fly list, you don't know.
[42:13.440 --> 42:17.440]  And yet you are the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Screening Coordination,
[42:17.440 --> 42:20.440]  Office of Policy, Department of Homeland Security in front of the Oversight Committee,
[42:20.440 --> 42:24.440]  and you can't give us one single number to some, I think, pretty basic questions?
[42:24.440 --> 42:30.440]  Some of those statistics aren't held by DHS, and so that's why I would like to work with my interagency.
[42:30.440 --> 42:34.440]  That's why I referenced your title. You're the one who's the Screening Coordinator for all this,
[42:34.440 --> 42:37.440]  and you said you were interagency. That's why I referenced your title.
[42:37.440 --> 42:40.440]  When you come from this place, you should have that information.
[42:40.440 --> 42:46.440]  I'm a DHS career civil servant employee, and I will work with my interagency partners,
[42:46.440 --> 42:51.440]  but they're the authoritative source for a lot of those numbers that you mentioned.
[42:51.440 --> 42:54.440]  You could get those numbers and the ones Mr. Russell asked for, that would be very helpful.
[42:54.440 --> 42:56.440]  I thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[42:56.440 --> 43:02.440]  She doesn't know what planet she's on, and that's because they've got a bunch of idiots
[43:02.440 --> 43:07.440]  at the heads of these agencies so the real criminals behind the scenes can rob us
[43:07.440 --> 43:11.440]  seven ways to Sunday and back again.
[43:11.440 --> 43:14.440]  And all we've done is reverse engineered what they're up to.
[43:14.440 --> 43:18.440]  This is an internal passport. The IRS admits it.
[43:18.440 --> 43:23.440]  They're now passing the laws and have passed one to not let you leave the country
[43:23.440 --> 43:27.440]  if the IRS just feels like it. Just like, oh, we just feel like you're on a no-fly list.
[43:27.440 --> 43:31.440]  We just feel like you're on a no-gun buy list, and we're not going to say how you get on it,
[43:31.440 --> 43:34.440]  how you get off, how many you're on it.
[43:34.440 --> 43:39.440]  At its peak, it was over 3 million. Then they reformed it. It was like 2.1 million.
[43:39.440 --> 43:43.440]  Incidentally, it's over 2 million people. I checked it in the last two years
[43:43.440 --> 43:46.440]  that have flown back and forth from the U.S. to Syria.
[43:46.440 --> 43:50.440]  Who knows how many of them are citizens of what, because they just don't have those numbers.
[43:50.440 --> 43:56.440]  Sorry, of course, they do have those numbers. You know what they use the NSA mainly for, according to
[43:56.440 --> 44:00.440]  top NSA officials we've interviewed that are retired or kicked out?
[44:00.440 --> 44:08.440]  Thomas Drake, William Benny, James Bamford, who talked to the experts
[44:08.440 --> 44:13.440]  and wrote a book about it, former nightline producer, top producer.
[44:13.440 --> 44:17.440]  Let me list some of the other ones. I don't want to just say top officials.
[44:17.440 --> 44:22.440]  Wayne Madsen, the list goes on and on. It's time to get Wayne Madsen on.
[44:22.440 --> 44:24.440]  He works for InfoWars now. He goes out in those reports for us.
[44:24.440 --> 44:27.440]  We post his reports daily at infowars.com. I want to get him on.
[44:27.440 --> 44:31.440]  Basically weekly, guys. I want Madsen on every week, at least 30 minutes.
[44:31.440 --> 44:35.440]  Madsen is so smart. I mean, he really just, it's good to talk to somebody when I go out to dinner
[44:35.440 --> 44:38.440]  or on air who knows as much as I do or a lot more on many subjects.
[44:38.440 --> 44:42.440]  It's very refreshing. I'm not bragging. It's just so good to know when he's saying stuff.
[44:42.440 --> 44:48.440]  It's so accurate. And what do they all tell us?
[44:48.440 --> 44:54.440]  The main focus of DHS is controlling all the agencies and stopping agencies
[44:54.440 --> 44:59.440]  from stopping real organized crime, money laundering, child kidnapping rings,
[44:59.440 --> 45:05.440]  narcotics being shipped around, all of it. And to keep them all confused.
[45:05.440 --> 45:09.440]  And the FBI has been on record and others have. You can look it up.
[45:09.440 --> 45:13.440]  Every time they're about to bust a real terrorist group or a real mafia group,
[45:13.440 --> 45:18.440]  their investigation gets killed by the DOJ or by the White House.
[45:18.440 --> 45:24.440]  And that's the big breaking news. But first, again, this is more of her testimony.
[45:24.440 --> 45:27.440]  This was the end of her testimony in Congress yesterday.
[45:27.440 --> 45:33.440]  The spokeswoman, the spokesperson. She can't criticize her because she's daring and brave.
[45:33.440 --> 45:39.440]  Like everybody else who has long hair. And Hillary, too. Can't question her because she's a woman.
[45:39.440 --> 45:42.440]  Here were her final words of the committee.
[45:42.440 --> 45:44.440]  After he steals the tank.
[45:44.440 --> 45:46.440]  Oh, from the Panzer Division.
[45:46.440 --> 45:48.440]  Oh, he brings it here into the bank.
[45:48.440 --> 45:57.440]  Oh, I see nothing. I was not here. I did not even get out this morning.
[45:57.440 --> 46:00.440]  Unbelievable. I mean, they're worse than that.
[46:00.440 --> 46:04.440]  At least Sergeant Schultz is funny.
[46:04.440 --> 46:09.440]  I love Hogan's Heroes. I tell you, the star of that show liked to party. That's probably what did he mean.
[46:09.440 --> 46:13.440]  All right, let's continue here, ladies and gentlemen, with the news.
[46:13.440 --> 46:17.440]  Drumroll, please. I mean, this is a big deal. It's getting almost no attention.
[46:17.440 --> 46:21.440]  Dailycaller.com. We have it up at infowars.com.
[46:21.440 --> 46:27.440]  Whistleblower. Feds shut down terror investigation that could have prevented San Bernardino attack.
[46:27.440 --> 46:30.440]  And this has also made it on the Fox News.
[46:30.440 --> 46:39.440]  A former Department of Homeland Security agent says that an investigation he was conducting in the fundamentalist Islamic group operating in the U.S. may have helped stop San Bernardino Jihad.
[46:39.440 --> 46:43.440]  Said Farouk attack had the government not shut down his probe and you go over it.
[46:43.440 --> 46:48.440]  It was a year ago. It was of the mosque. It was of them. It was of his wife.
[46:48.440 --> 46:55.440]  Her going to this Islamist training Jihad camp in Pakistan. I mean, they knew how to profile.
[46:55.440 --> 47:02.440]  The workplace violence. We got all these people running around from the mosque talking to bigs, talking to our people.
[47:02.440 --> 47:06.440]  And I'm sure they're wonderful, nice people. Okay, I'm sure.
[47:06.440 --> 47:13.440]  The point is, is that this is not workplace violence. This is not mental illness. This is programming in peer pressure.
[47:13.440 --> 47:19.440]  Just like they put you in the Marine Corps and you learn how to kill and you chant about killing all day.
[47:19.440 --> 47:29.440]  And if you don't act on the killer instinct when the moment comes, you will be a dead Marine. Do you understand me? You lowlife amphibious garbage.
[47:29.440 --> 47:34.440]  Well, it's the same thing. They send them over to these Jihad camps for men and women.
[47:34.440 --> 47:39.440]  And Obama knows ISIS is a secret weapon. It's brigades of women in combat.
[47:39.440 --> 47:42.440]  Look at Israel. They're having like daily stabbing attacks of women doing it.
[47:42.440 --> 47:49.440]  And he goes, he's just scared of women and children. Gave me and the kids doing all the stuff films, the eight and nine and 10 year olds blowing people's heads off.
[47:49.440 --> 47:55.440]  Russian and U.S. agents that were on the other side of this.
[47:55.440 --> 48:07.440]  During an interview on the Fox News, Megan Kelly Thursday, Philip Haney said that in 2012, right through last year, an agent of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection National Targeting Center,
[48:07.440 --> 48:18.440]  Tracking Center had opened an investigation of the Sunni Islamic group called, and then it goes over how to pronounce that, Tabula Jamat,
[48:18.440 --> 48:25.440]  a subset of the fundamentalist movement, Dino Bondi movement.
[48:25.440 --> 48:38.440]  But he said that just a year into the investigation, it was shut down in the State Department and the Homeland Security Office for civil rights and civil liberties, and then he and his team were investigated and shut down a year ago.
[48:38.440 --> 48:44.440]  And it just goes over it with all the links, all the proof. It is incredible.
[48:44.440 --> 48:55.440]  And they were targeting the specific people that reportedly did this. I think you have it as overwhelming. They were involved massively. They may have had accomplices.
[48:55.440 --> 49:03.440]  Here's another one. Report, Obama told NSC, an FBI to downplay terrorist angle of San Bernardino, another daily caller article.
[49:03.440 --> 49:09.440]  And then they go to the admissions of that. And again, I don't need to have this confirmed to know it's true. It was obvious.
[49:09.440 --> 49:18.440]  They were saying for days it wasn't terror when it was. The FBI is taking heat for failing to immediately classify the San Bernardino shootings as terrorism.
[49:18.440 --> 49:24.440]  But a new report shows that FBI reluctance could have been due to external pressure from the White House. Then it goes through the fact that they were pressuring them.
[49:24.440 --> 49:28.440]  I'll cover more of that when we come back.
[49:28.440 --> 49:39.440]  Meanwhile, though, here's a new article up on infowars.com from Tech Dirt. Intelligence professional says NSA deserves trust, power, and its bulk phone made a debt collection back.
[49:39.440 --> 49:48.440]  Oh, you have all this illegal surveillance. It's on the ground. Government assessment, humet that knows what this lady's up to.
[49:48.440 --> 49:55.440]  That's disregarded, ignored. Oh, and then I have another guy arrested for terrorism in London.
[49:55.440 --> 50:02.440]  Who was part of these PR stunts saying, I'm a Muslim. I'm labeled a terrorist. I trust you. Do you trust me?
[50:02.440 --> 50:06.440]  Enough for a hug in a nice little stunt.
[50:06.440 --> 50:11.440]  And look, he even let the women take their burqas off for the photo shoot. But they've got them hanging down around their necks.
[50:11.440 --> 50:16.440]  Isn't he nice? Oh, and look at this big taxpayer funded guy leading U.S. Imam and professor.
[50:16.440 --> 50:22.440]  You can go watch the video. It says Muslims can take property of filthy Christians and Jews.
[50:22.440 --> 50:28.440]  There's video. He says Christians are feces.
[50:28.440 --> 50:36.440]  If you translate it in urine and Muslims can take their property because we're filthy and impure.
[50:36.440 --> 50:42.440]  He's the most influential conservative cleric in American Islam.
[50:42.440 --> 50:46.440]  You can take everything. There are women all of it.
[50:46.440 --> 50:53.440]  And the feminists are like, whoa, yeah, man, I'm sick of these liberal men around here. I want it. I want to be in a slave dungeon.
[50:53.440 --> 50:59.440]  Whoa, yeah. Good. You will be. Ha, ha, ha, ha, weak American men.

[53:29.440 --> 53:33.440]  With a new year coming, it's time for a new way to look at weapon storage.
[53:33.440 --> 53:36.440]  Saves can't be accessed quickly, and racks are unsafe for children.

[55:05.440 --> 55:13.440]  Going into that process, we have a special report at infowars.com how Democrats secretly control the Republican Party delegate process.
[55:13.440 --> 55:18.440]  And they are Democrats. These aren't rhinos, folks, at the delegate level that stole it from Ron Paul and others.
[55:18.440 --> 55:22.440]  They are operatives. They know what they're doing.
[55:22.440 --> 55:29.440]  And the Tea Party is battling them right now, the good elements of it, to try to get a patriot in.
[55:29.440 --> 55:33.440]  And they've gotten Rand Paul to moderate. They've gotten all these other people.
[55:33.440 --> 55:41.440]  I don't care if it was Donald Trump, Rand Paul, or Ted Cruz, because I have the time magazine of people calling me saying,
[55:41.440 --> 55:45.440]  and the Daily Beast, I guess that's Newsweek, saying, what are you endorsing Trump now?
[55:45.440 --> 55:51.440]  I'm endorsing Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Donald Trump.
[55:51.440 --> 55:55.440]  I think either one of those guys is great. I don't want to see them fighting with each other.
[55:55.440 --> 55:57.440]  The enemy is Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush.
[55:57.440 --> 56:02.440]  And I will support a third party run of Donald Trump if it's Jeb Bush or Hillary.
[56:02.440 --> 56:07.440]  I will not support either one of those globalist criminals.
[56:07.440 --> 56:14.440]  It's that simple. I am committed to supporting one of those three candidates, period.
[56:14.440 --> 56:18.440]  And Trump is up front. Trump is not a coward.
[56:18.440 --> 56:24.440]  Trump will come on this show. I have been known for a fact that Trump in the last few years is getting really educated quickly.
[56:24.440 --> 56:27.440]  Like he said on the show, he said, listen, I've been totally focused on business.
[56:27.440 --> 56:32.440]  Politicians are beneath me, but now I'm in it. I'm learning fast, and he is. I'm going to stop right there.
[56:32.440 --> 56:36.440]  And that's why they're so scared of him right now.
[56:36.440 --> 56:42.440]  The media is ignoring the Donald Trump petition for 450,000 people signed at the White House saying,
[56:42.440 --> 56:46.440]  close our borders. Don't bring in people from ISIS nations.
[56:46.440 --> 56:51.440]  That's how they operate, creating the illusion everybody wants to get rid of Trump.
[56:51.440 --> 56:54.440]  But let me tell you, Trump is only a symptom of people's anger.
[56:54.440 --> 56:58.440]  You're not getting rid of this movement to expose the globalist.
[56:58.440 --> 57:05.440]  Briefly, before we end this hour, please get the articles out that are at infowars.com or dailycaller.com out that
[57:05.440 --> 57:14.440]  you have the White House blocking the investigation at the mosque of the husband and wife, of the training camps, going back two years ago.
[57:14.440 --> 57:17.440]  Well, starting three years ago, but running back a couple years.
[57:17.440 --> 57:19.440]  And they blocked it. They let it happen.
[57:19.440 --> 57:25.440]  We know they were under investigation. Another example of how they don't use this whole surveillance grid to protect us.
[57:25.440 --> 57:26.440]  They use it to enslave us.
[57:26.440 --> 57:33.440]  Now, before I end this hour, it is essential that you support the InfoWare by spreading the word and getting friends and family and neighbors

[58:53.440 --> 58:59.440]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula
[58:59.440 --> 59:02.440]  that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[59:02.440 --> 59:05.440]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[59:05.440 --> 59:09.440]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[59:09.440 --> 59:15.440]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[59:15.440 --> 59:20.440]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down, and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[59:20.440 --> 59:26.440]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[59:26.440 --> 59:34.440]  We worked with the leading manufacturer and nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[59:34.440 --> 59:41.440]  Introducing Child Ease with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.

[01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:25.440]  The boys tell how about your family.
[01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:31.440]  Aborted babies incinerated to eat UK hospitals.
[01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:35.440]  Silent green, ladies and gentlemen, is made out of people.
[01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:42.440]  But now children are literally being passed through the furnace in order to fuel hospitals in the UK.
[01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:47.440]  They're being sacrificed on the altar of efficiency and prosperity.
[01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:52.440]  That is the secret of Soylent Green.
[01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:57.440]  The powdered flesh from dead babies. Some people believe they can cure disease.
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:02.440]  Because of its enormous popularity, Soylent Green is in short supply.
[01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:05.440]  Remember, Tuesday is Soylent Green Day.
[01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:11.440]  The supply of Soylent Green has been exhausted. You must evacuate the area.
[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:18.440]  The family court ruled that the shareholders of PepsiCo, Big Builder Bird Group company,
[01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:24.440]  are not allowed to know what they're using the baby parts for and the flavoring, but we already know.
[01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:27.440]  So enjoy the flavor.
[01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:31.440]  We're going to get the real solution, which is going to be a combination of death panels and sales taxes.
[01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:38.440]  I'm consistently pro-death. I'm for assisted suicide. I'm for regular suicide. I'm for whatever gets the freeway moving.
[01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:42.440]  Is spending a million dollars on that last three months of life for that patient,
[01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:50.440]  would it be better not to lay off those ten teachers and to make that trade-up in medical costs?
[01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:54.440]  But that's called the death panel, and you're not supposed to have that discussion.
[01:01:54.440 --> 01:02:09.440]  They told me to say that they were sorry, but that you had become unreliable.
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:14.440]  Is this the kind of society that you want to live in? Any kind of society that would do this to its children
[01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:19.440]  will do it to its senior citizens. It will do it to its dissidents.
[01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:24.440]  This kind of society will also eventually turn on its police, on its army, on its prison guards,
[01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:28.440]  on the prisons and the collaborators who make that possible.
[01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:31.440]  This is nothing but a suicide cult.
[01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:39.440]  The scoops are on their way. The scoops are on their way. I repeat, the scoops are on their way.
[01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:46.440]  You will find out why Soylent Green means life. You will find out why Soylent Green means death.
[01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:49.440]  You're going to stop them? Come on!
[01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:53.440]  What is the secret of Soylent Green?
[01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:58.440]  Soylent Green is people!
[01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:08.440]  Each thing they'll be breeding is like cattle for food. You're going to tell them.
[01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:15.440]  In today's world, abortion supporters routinely attend pro-life rallies and attempt to bully activists.
[01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:21.440]  If you have a problem and need a smelly group of commie devil worshipers,
[01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:26.440]  maybe you can call the A-team.
[01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:29.440]  How many did I adopt? I killed my kids.
[01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:33.440]  I killed my kids.
[01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:38.440]  What the f**k is this? This face is f**king veiled. It doesn't stand for women's rights.
[01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:43.440]  Hey, we saw your Facebook with your communist hammer and sickle. That's pretty cool, man.
[01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:46.440]  Is that you on the Facebook?
[01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:50.440]  Is there a Facebook page of you with a hammer and sickle?
[01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:52.440]  I don't think so.
[01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:54.440]  I don't hear a thing!
[01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:01.440]  How do you get your abortions paid for?
[01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:02.440]  I pay for them.
[01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:04.440]  I thought you paid for them.
[01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:06.440]  Upwards of 50.
[01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:07.440]  Really?
[01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:08.440]  Oh yeah.
[01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:13.440]  F**k you, you piece of f**king s**t.
[01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:15.440]  Bunch of misogynist motherf**kers.
[01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:17.440]  Take your male privilege somewhere else.
[01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:18.440]  Dava, you've been aggressive.
[01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:19.440]  I'm being aggressive.
[01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:21.440]  Come on, in on us!
[01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:22.440]  In on us!
[01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:23.440]  Wow!
[01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:24.440]  Watch out.
[01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:28.440]  These steps and guys that attack our children.
[01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:35.440]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:00.440]  Red Alert.
[01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:06.440]  Obama brings in 13,000 Muslims who support suicide bombings every year.
[01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:07.440]  Let me explain.
[01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:14.440]  This headline is based upon Pew Research polling data, which is among the most respected polling firms in the world.
[01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:21.440]  And it is an alarming statistic considering the reality of the Pew Research poll that says
[01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:28.440]  13% of Muslims inside of the United States support suicide bombing, at least some of the time.
[01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:33.440]  And the U.S. now has over 100,000 Muslims being granted into the country each year.
[01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:42.440]  Meanwhile, Obama continues to mock those of us Americans who are concerned about radical Muslim refugees entering the country.
[01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:44.440]  Now they're worried about three-year-old orphans.
[01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:49.440]  But facts are facts, regardless of the Obama administration's decision to ignore them.
[01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:55.440]  The radical mindsets of the Muslim population in America is here, and it is growing.
[01:05:55.440 --> 01:06:20.440]  You can learn more right now at infowars.com.
[01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:30.440]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down, and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:36.440]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.

[01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:21.440]  You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he.
[01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:28.440]  Live from the infowarsselect.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:32.440]  If you're a CD viewer, you can see what I'm showing right now on the screen.
[01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:35.440]  If you're a radio listener, go to infowarsselect.com.
[01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:37.440]  But I'll let you in on it.
[01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:48.440]  I just tweeted during the break, President Chuck Norris 2016, tune in live to find out.
[01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:54.440]  And no, I'm not going to push the idea that Chuck Norris is running for president 2016, though I wish he would.
[01:08:54.440 --> 01:09:01.440]  His son, Mike Norris, accomplished filmmaker in his own right, is going to be joining us coming up in the next hour
[01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:09.440]  because he has produced a film with a pretty good budget that his dad and others warned him would have Hollywood come after him
[01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:15.440]  and try to blackball him just like they've tried to do to Chuck Norris, who you see there on screen with his son, Mike Norris.
[01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:20.440]  And that has certainly happened. They are really coming after this film.
[01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:26.440]  But many of these films he's produced do also end up airing, in fact, all of them on cable to tens of millions.
[01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:31.440]  This is going to be undoubtedly a very successful film.
[01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:42.440]  We'll tell you about its release in theaters, in television, Blu-ray DVD coming up when he joins us in the third hour today.
[01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:52.440]  And it's a bold move that they're engaged in here, folks, to really expose the whole Agenda 21, Agenda EMP agenda,
[01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:56.440]  which is fabulous, they're in our governments, one of the top actors they got.
[01:09:56.440 --> 01:10:01.440]  It's got a bunch of big actors in it. It plays basically a Maury Strong character who just died last week.
[01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:07.440]  Yours truly is in the film. I've lost another 20 pounds since I was in the film. I wish I'm still not that skinny.
[01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:12.440]  I tell you, Mike Norris looks great. He's almost getting too skinny. I tell you, that guy's in great shape.
[01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:18.440]  So he's going to be in studio with us talking about all things Planet Norris.
[01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:22.440]  Because there's only one thing that would Trump, Donald Trump, running for president.
[01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:29.440]  And I'm telling you, America would love to have President Chuck Norris.
[01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:34.440]  And you know what? I was talking to Mike about that.
[01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:36.440]  There might have been some talk about it.
[01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:44.440]  We might even have more for you in the next hour on the idea of President Chuck Norris 2016.
[01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:48.440]  I have a question. Would you have President Trump, Vice President Norris?
[01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:52.440]  Or would you have President Norris, Vice President Trump?
[01:10:52.440 --> 01:11:00.440]  Now, Chuck Norris is a very humble person, but I don't know if America would allow him to be Vice President.
[01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:04.440]  Maybe he could be a dual presidents then, or something. I mean, I was having two presidents.
[01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:08.440]  I guess that is kind of what a vice president is, but I'm just having some fun with this.
[01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:15.440]  It's kind of gallows humor because everything is unfolding, world government, forced inoculations, the FBI coming out.
[01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:19.440]  Yeah, we were ordered not to stop the terrorists that attacked in San Bernardino last week.
[01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:27.440]  So it is a White House false flag. They brought them in. They let them let her have fake visa info, let her use fake addresses, and let her attack.
[01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:33.440]  I covered that in the last hour. We now have this leading imam and U.S. professor on the taxpayer dole, I guess,
[01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:37.440]  saying Muslims can take property of filthy Christians and Jews.
[01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:42.440]  And again, I'm not Islamophobic. I don't dislike Muslims in general. Everybody knows I was against all these wars,
[01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:48.440]  but now I'm not for bringing in all these radicals and just letting them run around saying you will be under Sharia law
[01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:54.440]  and your mother and your daughters will wear burqas on their heads and you will submit.
[01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:56.440]  I mean, that's what this comes down to.
[01:11:56.440 --> 01:12:02.440]  Now we're going to have Alex Newman with us till about 45 after and then I'll shift gears into the Second Amendment attack,
[01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:08.440]  the jobless numbers, and a bunch of other really important stories that we haven't gotten to yet.
[01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:14.440]  But next hour, the premiere of the trailer, first sneak peek of Amerageddon.
[01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:17.440]  I forget how many millions the budget was. We had a really good budget.
[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:21.440]  I mean, I showed up for the movies, all these giant trucks and cranes, and I was like,
[01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:25.440]  this is a bigger production than when I was in Waking Life and Scanner Darkly.
[01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:32.440]  Like Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder and Woody Harrelson and who's the guy that plays Iron Man?
[01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:36.440]  Robert Downey Jr. Everybody was super cool on the set of that, but Robert Downey Jr.
[01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:39.440]  He really thought he was God, but I guess he's the highest paid actor.
[01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:44.440]  I guess he's like John Lennon, you know, we're bigger than Jesus until you find out you're not.
[01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:47.440]  Of course, John Lennon didn't really mean that when he said it was tongue in cheek,
[01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:50.440]  but still it's not a lucky statement. It's like the Titanic.
[01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:57.440]  Not even God can sink this ship and then you find out real fast what happens on your maiden voyage.
[01:12:57.440 --> 01:13:01.440]  But shifting gears to a focus we've been looking at for a month really intensely,
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:06.440]  but the last several weeks as it kicked off and now is getting ready to close early next week.
[01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:13.440]  And that is the situation with the biggest grouping of world leaders in history
[01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:20.440]  for the UN summit on climate change that's really a carbon tax global government, global court initiative.
[01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:25.440]  The newamerican.com is the magazine of the John Burr Society.
[01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:27.440]  Crack reporters out there taking actions.
[01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:32.440]  And Alex Newman is an international journalist, educator, author and consultant,
[01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:36.440]  and he writes for WorldNet Daily and the New American Magazine.
[01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:40.440]  And of course, as a frequent guest here, I'm not going to go over his whole bio, his TV programs,
[01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:44.440]  the conferences and the rest of it, but he joins us as a crack investigative journalist
[01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:49.440]  from the ground in socialist occupied globalist command base,
[01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:52.440]  UN cesspool Paris, nothing against the beautiful city of Paris,
[01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:57.440]  but it is a mixture of Jihadville and UN socialist cesspool
[01:13:57.440 --> 01:14:02.440]  where the socialists are all above the law and tax exempt and use terrorist attacks.
[01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:05.440]  They open the door for basically declare martial law.
[01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:09.440]  You've been there now for I guess a large portion of this conference.
[01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:12.440]  What can you report to us, Alex Newman?
[01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:15.440]  Well, I think you give a really good description right at the start.
[01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:18.440]  I mean, this is not a conference about the climate every once in a while.
[01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:20.440]  Let's talk about global warming or climate,
[01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:22.440]  but they're not really interested in the science or the climate.
[01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:23.440]  That's the cover.
[01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:25.440]  It is exactly.
[01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:28.440]  And what they're really discussing here is international wealth redistribution,
[01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:32.440]  setting up the nucleus of the global government at carbon taxes.
[01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:38.440]  And, you know, essentially every leftist globalist, socialist, ridiculous idea
[01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:41.440]  has found its way into this conference under one guise or another.
[01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:45.440]  So, you know, you have to save the forest people with the carbon tax people
[01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:50.440]  and all of them working together to essentially build up the nucleus of the global government.
[01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:52.440]  And the latest draft treaty that they've released,
[01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:54.440]  the last one I have came from last night.
[01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:56.440]  They're supposedly working on the next one.
[01:14:56.440 --> 01:15:02.440]  Essentially, it's committing the world to reduce and eventually eliminate by 2050
[01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:04.440]  the use of fossil fuels.
[01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:08.440]  People are going to be condemning billions of people to perpetual poverty
[01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:10.440]  and probably early death.
[01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:13.440]  So, you know, the consequences of this summit are going to be huge
[01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:16.440]  and they're going to be well beyond just the loss of freedom.
[01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:20.440]  We're talking about people's lives on the line here.
[01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:24.440]  It's so sickening to watch this group of collectivist in jumbo jets
[01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:28.440]  with all the hookers and the $1,000 plate food for two weeks
[01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:31.440]  lecturing everyone on how they can have air conditioning or automobiles.
[01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:32.440]  I mean, they actually do that.
[01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:35.440]  I'm not just saying that. Everyone knows that.
[01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:42.440]  And then they cast themselves as the heroes in their own taxpayer-funded production.
[01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:48.440]  I mean, this is so ridiculously over the top and so villainous, Mr. Newman,
[01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:51.440]  but they seem to get away with it.
[01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:52.440]  Well, they do.
[01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:54.440]  I'm actually sitting in the press pool right now
[01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:56.440]  and it shouldn't be called the press pool.
[01:15:56.440 --> 01:16:00.440]  It should be called the cheerleading pool because you have here a bunch of climate cultists
[01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:02.440]  who believe, of course, the global warming scam,
[01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:06.440]  and they also believe that these governments, these dictatorships that are here in force,
[01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:09.440]  have the power to control the climate.
[01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:13.440]  They think that at least the press pool thinks that if we flash our fossil fuel used
[01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:17.440]  to deindustrialize our society, transfer all our wealth, third world dictators,
[01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:19.440]  suddenly the climate is going to obey us
[01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:23.440]  and the temperature is not going to increase above 1.5 degrees.
[01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:26.440]  So if you understand the science, if you've been talking to the scientists,
[01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:28.440]  if you've looked at the IPCC information,
[01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:33.440]  it's clear that this is all a gigantic charade to con us out of our money
[01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:35.440]  and out of our freedom and out of our national sovereignty.
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:38.440]  But the reason people aren't educated by and large around the world,
[01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:41.440]  Americans are much better at this than the rest of the world,
[01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:45.440]  but it's because of the people upstairs and the people down here in the press pool.
[01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:47.440]  It's pathetic. It's a disgrace.
[01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:50.440]  I'm just ashamed to call myself a journalist being in this area.
[01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:53.440]  I mean, these people are really cheerleaders.
[01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:57.440]  If you look around, you see on all their laptops, they have a change the system, not the climate.
[01:16:57.440 --> 01:16:59.440]  And these are supposed to be journalists.
[01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:02.440]  You have the AFP, the French news agency, co-sponsoring the climate
[01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:07.440]  and pumping out ridiculous propaganda that these governments are going to save us from sea level rise.
[01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:10.440]  Well, France doesn't produce anything anymore.
[01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:15.440]  And their governing classes, as you know, is going to get a large slice of third world carbon tax
[01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:17.440]  that's meant to absolutely cripple them.
[01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:19.440]  So this is the new colonialism.
[01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:24.440]  And if you watch Sony PlayStation or these other video game ads, you get what's happening.
[01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:30.440]  It's all be a hero, command forces, lead assault troops, be a man, be a leader.
[01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:33.440]  Don't really do that in the real world in business or life or be a great dad.
[01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:34.440]  Take care of your kids.
[01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:36.440]  Don't be a firefighter, police officer, anything like that.
[01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:38.440]  Don't be a hard-working farmer.
[01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:41.440]  Don't be an engineer or a writer or a teacher.
[01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:43.440]  No, you're going to be a hero in this fantasy land.
[01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:47.440]  Well, they've built it as save the earth from global freezing.
[01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:48.440]  Save the earth from global warming.
[01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:50.440]  Save the earth from global climate change.
[01:17:50.440 --> 01:17:52.440]  Be a climate warrior.
[01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:54.440]  Help take over. Help govern.
[01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:57.440]  Live off other people's tax money and feel good about yourself.
[01:17:57.440 --> 01:17:58.440]  And so that's what it is.
[01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:01.440]  It's all cast with it just like, oh, we're heroes.
[01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:02.440]  Oh, we're so great.
[01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:10.440]  And it's a giant flaming conscious fraud invented by Enron 20 years ago and Al Gore on record
[01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:13.440]  to literally take a cut of all human activity on earth.
[01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:16.440]  It couldn't get more ridiculous.
[01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:17.440]  That's exactly right.
[01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:20.440]  They're talking about putting a price on carbon dioxide.
[01:18:20.440 --> 01:18:25.440]  All the scientists that we've talked to since we arrived in Paris have explained that carbon dioxide is the gas of life.
[01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:26.440]  This is the stuff we exhale.
[01:18:26.440 --> 01:18:30.440]  This is what plants need to breathe and the earth is starved for carbon dioxide.
[01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:37.440]  So you have this giant charade here where we're pretending that the gas of life is pollution in need of regulation and in need of taxation
[01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:42.440]  so that we can pay carbon taxes to Al Gore, to Goldman Sachs, to the United Nations,
[01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:47.440]  all the while having what little remains of our wealth and what little remains of our free market and what little remains of our liberty
[01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:49.440]  stripped from us to deal with the hoax.
[01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:52.440]  And you can tell it's a very well orchestrated charade here.
[01:18:52.440 --> 01:19:00.440]  You know, they have the the rental mobs outside these taxpayer funded NGOs demanding climate, justice, climate, justice.
[01:19:00.440 --> 01:19:05.440]  And the negotiators walk past and they say, oh, yes, you know, the world citizens really want climate justice.
[01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:06.440]  We better get to work.
[01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:10.440]  And so they're in there right now haggling about whether we're going to keep temperature.
[01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:12.440]  Poor legs good, true legs bad.
[01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:15.440]  Jumbo just bad unless they're ours.
[01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:19.440]  It's just we're at a private jet airport.
[01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:20.440]  This conference is taking place at Lubuja.
[01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:26.440]  This is an airport for private jets so that the presidents and the dictators and the celebrities and the Al Gore's can come here in their private jets.
[01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:29.440]  And then they say, well, we bought carbon offset.
[01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:32.440]  And let's be honest, they don't they don't have Hollywood trailers anymore.
[01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:36.440]  The jets are for the sex parties, the drugs under international law.
[01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:40.440]  They can keep them all on board, never clear customs, even bring in some sex slaves.
[01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:41.440]  And I'm not joking.
[01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:45.440]  I bet Monday, some of these UN delegates have got people chained up on board those aircraft.
[01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:47.440]  They're always getting caught doing it.
[01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:52.440]  I mean, you cannot make up the magnitude of the corruption, the insolence.
[01:19:52.440 --> 01:19:53.440]  Look at this report.
[01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:56.440]  World war will run on a breathable air unless we cut carbon.
[01:19:56.440 --> 01:20:22.440]  She will be right back.
[01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:32.440]  We use mobile devices right against our bodies every day.
[01:20:32.440 --> 01:20:39.440]  But growing scientific evidence has emerged showing serious health risks associated with exposure to EMF radiation emitted from these devices.

[01:23:58.440 --> 01:24:21.440]  I start ranting and raving pretty much just to second nature like breathing.
[01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:34.440]  Because I think about the hundreds, hundreds, they're reporting over 300 large, wide-body jets just for the world leaders and their staff.
[01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:45.440]  And then hundreds of other private guests for Alec Baldwin and Leonardo DiCaprio and all these people who live like emperors,
[01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:52.440]  to lecture us on how we're evil and need to be arrested because we don't want carbon taxes.
[01:24:52.440 --> 01:25:04.440]  And then I have this article, report. This is from Yahoo and it's takepart.com, just some PR firm, leftist group.
[01:25:04.440 --> 01:25:08.440]  Report, the world will run out of breathable air unless carbon is cut.
[01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:14.440]  Now, this is an inversion of reality. It is on record that the carbon cycle is four things.
[01:25:14.440 --> 01:25:21.440]  Sunlight, water, carbon dioxide and oxygen.
[01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:28.440]  If you don't have water, sunlight, carbon dioxide and oxygen, the carbon cycle ends.
[01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:33.440]  They admit that the earth is losing a lot of its atmosphere, has less atmosphere than it had millions of years ago.
[01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:39.440]  Mars, they've not confirmed, has water all over it, did have oceans on it, lost most of its atmosphere.
[01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:47.440]  Plants and animals in symbiotic relationship in the carbon cycle with water and sunlight and carbon dioxide and oxygen
[01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:51.440]  create more carbon dioxide and oxygen that are trace gases.
[01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:58.440]  It is known that the earth has had carbon dioxide at hundreds of times its levels and oxygen was much higher as well.
[01:25:58.440 --> 01:26:03.440]  We are in a crisis actually. I can't believe it. And of course, that's the mainline science.
[01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:12.440]  You can go discover that. That's not debated. That they believe desertification and things are being accelerated because of lower carbon dioxide levels.
[01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:17.440]  And then they put out reports saying, we've got to cut carbon or the earth is going to die. There will be no air.
[01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:23.440]  When they're the ones, it's almost got a plan. Like, there's all this fossil fuel, it's dirty, it's got problems,
[01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:27.440]  but we burn it right at the key time and it beefs up our atmosphere a little bit.
[01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:35.440]  I mean, we should really have big terraforming facilities like aliens, you know, where they've got them pumping CO2 into the atmosphere to terraform the planet.
[01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:42.440]  LV246 or whatever it's called in the movie. I'm not kidding. We should actually not be pumping it back into the ground.
[01:26:42.440 --> 01:26:46.440]  We should be pumping it up. They're talking about cutting down trees.
[01:26:46.440 --> 01:26:50.440]  I'm going to just keep moving to the end of the hour because I'm cutting into his time and I want to hear him report here.
[01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:53.440]  It's just that, do you understand the magnitude of this, folks?
[01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:57.440]  Report, the world will run out of breathable air unless carbon is cut.
[01:26:57.440 --> 01:27:02.440]  Marine plants such as photoplankton are estimated to produce more than half the Earth's atmospheric oxygen.
[01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:04.440]  Of course, the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration.
[01:27:04.440 --> 01:27:10.440]  And it just goes into all this mumbo-jumbo garbage and saying, if it rises six degrees, it will hurt the plankton and then we won't have the oxygen.
[01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:14.440]  More CO2 makes them produce more oxygen. It's just loads of bull.
[01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:20.440]  I've had all the top experts on photoplankton and astrophysics and I'm ranting three minutes to break.
[01:27:20.440 --> 01:27:27.440]  What else is happening, Alex Newman, at the conference where they're going to save us from the carbon cycle that is life itself?
[01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:29.440]  You made some excellent points right there, Alex.
[01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:34.440]  We went on Monday. We went to the CO2 conference put on by the Heartland Institute.
[01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:39.440]  Lots of top experts. I mean, the credentials of these guys are just off the charts.
[01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:44.440]  And all of them explain carbon dioxide is wonderful for the planet, the Earth is starved for carbon dioxide.
[01:27:44.440 --> 01:27:48.440]  The global warming hoax needs to be exposed because millions of people are going to die.
[01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:51.440]  The next day we went to the French countercott 21 summit.
[01:27:51.440 --> 01:27:58.440]  Same thing, European experts, the head of the European Chemical Society, professors from top universities explaining exactly the same thing.
[01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:02.440]  Carbon dioxide is wonderful for the planet. It is the gas of life.
[01:28:02.440 --> 01:28:07.440]  And these fraudsters here at the United Nations are saying it's pollution and we need to regulate it.
[01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:15.440]  One of the things that went on here that I do want to tell the listeners about, my colleague and I were actually intimidated by the Communist Chinese dictatorship.
[01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:18.440]  And so that made us really uncomfortable. We just put an article out about it.
[01:28:18.440 --> 01:28:21.440]  Yesterday we went over to their booth and asked them for an interview.
[01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:26.440]  Instead of giving us an interview, they tracked us back to the media center and I turned around from my desk.
[01:28:26.440 --> 01:28:30.440]  And the same guy we had talked to is sitting there snapping pictures of my colleague and I.
[01:28:30.440 --> 01:28:37.440]  So we're going to make a big deal out of this. Communist China does this all the time, haranguing dissidents, spying on dissidents.
[01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:40.440]  And it's unacceptable. The UN says there's nothing they can do about it.
[01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:42.440]  The French police say there's nothing they can do about it.
[01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:47.440]  Well, at least people need to know about it. These are the maniacs that the UN is talking about handing over the keys.
[01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:51.440]  I bet there's nothing they can do about it. Chuck Norris kicks them in the nose.
[01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:57.440]  Right. So that would be brilliant. But I mean, the French police say, no, that's UN territory where powerless will take your...
[01:28:57.440 --> 01:29:00.440]  I mean, I filed a report with them, but they can't do anything. They can't even come in here.
[01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:02.440]  They can't even wear their police uniforms here.
[01:29:02.440 --> 01:29:06.440]  Then the UN police say, no, they're with the government. Sorry, there's nothing we can do. We work for the government.
[01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:11.440]  That's what I was saying earlier. Diplomatic immunity zone for them to snort all the cocaine they want.
[01:29:11.440 --> 01:29:15.440]  That's right. I mean, the diplomatic immunity stuff has got to go.
[01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:19.440]  So many crimes are being perpetrated all over the world, including in the United States.
[01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:21.440]  We have spies, drug dealers...
[01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:26.440]  Stay there. I'm going to come back and for like 10 minutes give you the floor to really roll with your report, Alex Newman.
[01:29:26.440 --> 01:29:31.440]  And what you went through with the Communist Chinese, the photos, you have up at the New American Magazine.
[01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:36.440]  We just showed that to TV viewers. We're going to post your article at infowars.com as well.
[01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:45.440]  NewAmerican.com. See why I get so upset? It just gets crazier. Communist Chinese harassing people, diplomatic immunity, taxpayer paid for.
[01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:49.440]  I mean, folks, when are we going to get angry and say no?
[01:29:49.440 --> 01:30:07.440]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:26.440]  Come and take it, Texas, and don't comply.com are pitching a life and liberty event to end gunfree zones.
[01:30:26.440 --> 01:30:33.440]  The active shooter drill will take place near the University of Texas this Saturday, but this time the shooter picks the wrong crowd.
[01:30:33.440 --> 01:30:44.440]  The planned event comes at a particularly tense time in the nation's gun debate, and Texas colleges and universities are debating how to implement the state's new campus carry law that will start next fall.
[01:30:44.440 --> 01:30:52.440]  But gun control advocates say this event is offensive, and so they're staging a mass farting and dildo-waving counter-protest.
[01:30:52.440 --> 01:30:55.440]  I fart in your general direction.
[01:30:55.440 --> 01:31:18.440]  Read more about this event at infowars.com.
[01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:29.440]  2-5-3-3-1-3-9
[01:31:56.440 --> 01:32:02.440]  We have been fighting this war tirelessly with you at our side.
[01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:09.440]  Day in and day out, exposing the ludicrous lies and criminal operations of the globalists, and we're starting to see big effects.
[01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:11.440]  And the word is getting out.
[01:32:11.440 --> 01:32:17.440]  The globalists want to make us dependent, and as Napoleon famously said, an army marches on its stomach.
[01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:26.440]  Ammunition, food, and supplies form the backbone of any offensive, including the Info War, and our enemies admit they're losing the Info War.
[01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:30.440]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[01:32:30.440 --> 01:32:36.440]  With this in mind, we have held strong to our principles and the decision to refuse any money from globalists or government.
[01:32:36.440 --> 01:32:47.440]  We are funding our crusade against tyranny the old-fashioned way with pure, free-market, free-will capitalism.

[01:32:53.440 --> 01:33:00.440]  May God bless you and your family, and keep us strong as we forge ahead in this battle for humanity.
[01:33:00.440 --> 01:33:05.440]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:05.440 --> 01:33:13.440]  Is Chuck Norris going to run for president in 2016?
[01:33:13.440 --> 01:33:16.440]  Am I pulling your leg?
[01:33:16.440 --> 01:33:20.440]  Was I pulling your leg last week when I told you Donald Trump was coming on?
[01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:26.440]  Could we draft Chuck Norris to run in 2016?
[01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:29.440]  A flying sidekick takes out Hillary.
[01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:33.440]  A flying sidekick takes out Ted Bush.
[01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:41.440]  Flying sidekick knocks the orange possum off of the head of Donald Trump.
[01:33:41.440 --> 01:33:46.440]  By the way, Donald Trump makes fun of his hair and the fact that he's orange, just like I make fun of my big pumpkin head.
[01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:52.440]  So it's all done in friendliness.
[01:33:52.440 --> 01:33:55.440]  We're going to premiere the trailer for the first time ever.
[01:33:55.440 --> 01:34:08.440]  Amerageddon at the start of the next hour, and then we will have Mike Norris, the director in studio with us for the balance of the hour.
[01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:13.440]  Amerageddon is a dire warning wake-up call of what could be our future.
[01:34:13.440 --> 01:34:18.440]  When a globalist terrorist organization along with the United Nations disables the U.S. power grid and institutes martial law,
[01:34:18.440 --> 01:34:26.440]  it will take a dedicated family of patriots armed with strong survival skills and the remains of the Second Amendment to save America and reclaim its freedom.
[01:34:26.440 --> 01:34:29.440]  This is the movie they do not want you to see banned from Hollywood.
[01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:30.440]  It actually happened.
[01:34:30.440 --> 01:34:36.440]  It comes out in theaters March 2nd in Texas only at first, Texas Independence Day, then a wider release later,
[01:34:36.440 --> 01:34:42.440]  based on a true story that hasn't happened yet, action packed with multiple layers, political and personal.
[01:34:42.440 --> 01:34:51.440]  And with some inside baseball, all this is a way to serialize it and to a general audience on television, wake people up to what's happening.
[01:34:51.440 --> 01:34:58.440]  Almost like Red Dawn 2.0 or America with a K with Chris Christofferson 2.0.
[01:34:58.440 --> 01:35:00.440]  Very, very important film.
[01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:04.440]  And yes, I'm in it, but that's not the reason it's important.
[01:35:04.440 --> 01:35:09.440]  It's the storyline of the film that will reach out to a larger audience.
[01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:11.440]  So that is coming up.
[01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:14.440]  Most of the brainwashing we see is in Hollywood.
[01:35:14.440 --> 01:35:16.440]  It's in, you know, entertainment television.
[01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:20.440]  We are beating the globalist when it comes to news with our information.
[01:35:20.440 --> 01:35:24.440]  But most of the real war is going on in the entertainment zone.
[01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:27.440]  That's why Amerageddon is so important.
[01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:31.440]  Amerageddonthemovie.com, Amerageddonthemovie.com.
[01:35:31.440 --> 01:35:37.440]  We're going to tweet that out with a trailer that just went live at infowars.com.
[01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:43.440]  We are going to tweet that out at Real Alex Jones, and we're going to be posting it to Facebook.
[01:35:43.440 --> 01:35:52.440]  Amerageddon exclusive release, powerful film exposes globalist, takeover plan, director, son of Chuck Norris reveals trailer on film.
[01:35:52.440 --> 01:35:54.440]  No one wants you to see.
[01:35:54.440 --> 01:35:56.440]  So that is coming up.
[01:35:56.440 --> 01:36:00.440]  We'll release the film today that no one in the establishment wants you to see.
[01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:03.440]  So that is coming up.
[01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:07.440]  Alex Nimman will be with us for the balance of the hour.
[01:36:07.440 --> 01:36:18.440]  Briefly here, we have come out with a private labeled super high quality solar panel system that comes with the battery system and the control system with all the adapters.
[01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:23.440]  That is about 40% less than the leading competitor.
[01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:32.440]  We have sold out of the other units that are for jumping your car and the rest of it that are way, way, way, way under their competitors as well.
[01:36:32.440 --> 01:36:38.440]  This is really a high quality unit, and we only have gotten a hundred of these.
[01:36:38.440 --> 01:36:41.440]  And so it will sell out the next few weeks or so.
[01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:44.440]  Plus, we don't have a hundred because a couple people in the office want one.
[01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:45.440]  I'm going to get a couple of them.
[01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:49.440]  So let's just say we got about 60 of these left right now currently.
[01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:56.440]  So it could sell out in days at the current rates and your purchase of this product makes what we do here possible.
[01:36:56.440 --> 01:37:00.440]  The info or solar based station power supply.
[01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:05.440]  Separately, we've got free shipping until December 18th when you're guaranteed to get your package before Christmas.
[01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:16.440]  If you order then, and we've got a bunch of specials, the essentials pack, survival shield X2, supermail or female vitality and silver bullet, the loyal silver 33% off on top of free shipping.
[01:37:16.440 --> 01:37:22.440]  The deep cleanse pack, deep cleanse, living defense, oxy powder, 28% off.
[01:37:22.440 --> 01:37:30.440]  Winter sun, vitamin D, the truly absorbable type be taken under the tongue, sublingual, 15% off plus the free shipping.
[01:37:30.440 --> 01:37:34.440]  Deep cleanse first ever sale, probably our hottest selling product, but we can't ever keep it in stock.
[01:37:34.440 --> 01:37:36.440]  So we can't get enough supply of it.
[01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:38.440]  So it's not our best seller because we just can't keep it.
[01:37:38.440 --> 01:37:44.440]  I'm just discounting it on top of that, 17% off and free shipping.
[01:37:44.440 --> 01:38:01.440]  And the wake up America coffee special two bags of info wars coffee, super high quality from the high mountains, non GMO handpicked by the local Chiapas farmers, organic volcanic soil and get an info wars mug free all supplies last.
[01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:06.440]  And a lot more at info wars store.com or info wars life.com.
[01:38:06.440 --> 01:38:16.440]  And it is your purchase of the products that makes everything here possible. And in closing, it's important, just as important as buying products from us and checking them out.
[01:38:16.440 --> 01:38:28.440]  They're great prices, high quality game changers is supporting our local MNFM affiliates, becoming a sponsor, letting sponsors know why you're supporting them, letting stations know why you're supporting them, buying a billboard for the station.
[01:38:28.440 --> 01:38:37.440]  If people of means middle class, upper middle class, a new vareish, old money, if you don't start fighting folks.
[01:38:37.440 --> 01:38:47.440]  If you don't start taking action like the producers of American have done and others have done, if you don't get involved in the fight now, we will lose everything.
[01:38:47.440 --> 01:38:50.440]  It's that simple.
[01:38:50.440 --> 01:38:53.440]  Now is the time.
[01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:59.440]  Now is the time to choose sides because sitting in the middle is choosing a side or joining the globalist.
[01:38:59.440 --> 01:39:06.440]  They want you to sit on your butt and watch television all day or, you know, watch the Kardashians.
[01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:09.440]  They don't want you to be informed and involved in taking action.
[01:39:09.440 --> 01:39:11.440]  They want you thinking of it as work.
[01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:15.440]  You're going to lose your freedom and lose your prosperity if you don't fight these people.
[01:39:15.440 --> 01:39:21.440]  And it's pretty easy to beat them because their program is so outrageous if we just take action.
[01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:24.440]  Everybody can see it. Now is the time.
[01:39:24.440 --> 01:39:27.440]  And Donald Trump is in the arena.
[01:39:27.440 --> 01:39:29.440]  They're taking out of context what he has to say.
[01:39:29.440 --> 01:39:31.440]  Some of the things he said I don't even agree with.
[01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:32.440]  It doesn't matter.
[01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:41.440]  He's exposing the globalist agenda, the big banks that are tax exempt, the open borders, world government, the plan to deindustrialize us, the plan that China gets to have carbon taxes on us.
[01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:43.440]  They have no carbon taxes to shut us down.
[01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:45.440]  He's telling the truth.
[01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:49.440]  98% of the time.
[01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:51.440]  There's another report out at infowars.com.
[01:39:51.440 --> 01:39:52.440]  The plan.
[01:39:52.440 --> 01:39:56.440]  We got to air some of this in the fourth hour today with the delegates.
[01:39:56.440 --> 01:40:05.440]  The run by Democrats and the Republican Party basically to make sure Donald Trump or Rand Paul or somebody like Ted Cruz doesn't get in.
[01:40:05.440 --> 01:40:07.440]  All right, enough of me ranting and raving.
[01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:10.440]  Let's go back now and give them the floor until we go to break in 10 minutes, 11 minutes.
[01:40:10.440 --> 01:40:20.440]  Alex Newman of the New American magazine investigative journalist in Paris for this key world government event now taking place.
[01:40:20.440 --> 01:40:22.440]  Continue to roll through all the different areas that you've been breaking down.
[01:40:22.440 --> 01:40:23.440]  Excellent.
[01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:24.440]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:40:24.440 --> 01:40:27.440]  It's a pleasure to be able to share this information with your listeners.
[01:40:27.440 --> 01:40:34.440]  I think one of the things that the American people really need to know about here is we must stop this and we can stop this right now.
[01:40:34.440 --> 01:40:42.440]  The politics of this is such that everybody here understands the US Congress is not necessarily ready to play along with this.
[01:40:42.440 --> 01:40:49.440]  Senator Inhofe appeared on Monday here in Paris via video link and he explained that this is a sham.
[01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:50.440]  It's a fraud.
[01:40:50.440 --> 01:40:51.440]  We're not going to do it.
[01:40:51.440 --> 01:40:52.440]  The Congress is not going to fund it.
[01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:59.440]  Congress already opposes all of Obama's unilateral actions on global warming and so-called global warming, I should say.
[01:40:59.440 --> 01:41:04.440]  That is the key. We need to get our elected officials on board here.
[01:41:04.440 --> 01:41:10.440]  We need to educate them about the science, about the policy agenda that's being pursued by the United Nations and by Obama.
[01:41:10.440 --> 01:41:13.440]  Because if we don't stop it, we're going to lose what we have left of our freedom.
[01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:19.440]  We're going to lose what we have left of our markets and of our prosperity and we're going to deindustrialize our society.
[01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:28.440]  We're going to condemn millions, maybe billions of people in poorer countries, undeveloped countries, living under totalitarian dictatorships to perpetual poverty.
[01:41:28.440 --> 01:41:29.440]  Probably death.
[01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:31.440]  So it's not a theoretical problem.
[01:41:31.440 --> 01:41:36.440]  It's not a political problem, but we as Americans can take action to stop this.
[01:41:36.440 --> 01:41:39.440]  And really, America is the only hope for stopping this.
[01:41:39.440 --> 01:41:42.440]  There's a big charade here about, oh, Saudi Arabia isn't playing along.
[01:41:42.440 --> 01:41:44.440]  China is not playing along.
[01:41:44.440 --> 01:41:45.440]  They point the finger at it.
[01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:49.440]  They give out the fossil awards and they say different governments aren't playing along.
[01:41:49.440 --> 01:41:50.440]  It's all a sham.
[01:41:50.440 --> 01:41:51.440]  They're all on board with this.
[01:41:51.440 --> 01:41:52.440]  China is on board with this.
[01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:59.440]  They love the idea that America is going to destroy its economy, move what little remains of our industry and our manufacturing over to China,
[01:41:59.440 --> 01:42:05.440]  because it's too expensive to manufacture things in the United States thanks to the carving taxes and Obama's power plan.
[01:42:05.440 --> 01:42:06.440]  So we need to stop this.
[01:42:06.440 --> 01:42:14.440]  Our prosperity, our liberty, our independence, our rights, and the future of our children and our grandchildren depend on putting a stop to this.
[01:42:14.440 --> 01:42:18.440]  And I think we can still do it if we put enough pressure on our elected representatives.
[01:42:18.440 --> 01:42:19.440]  And we have to be informed about it.
[01:42:19.440 --> 01:42:21.440]  There's plenty of information out there.
[01:42:21.440 --> 01:42:24.440]  There's plenty of science out there that people can use to educate themselves.
[01:42:24.440 --> 01:42:30.440]  If you're a scientist, if you're an expert, if you understand this stuff, if you have a PhD or a master's degree,
[01:42:30.440 --> 01:42:36.440]  pick up a copy of the NIPCC report, the Non-Governmental International Panel on Climate Change.
[01:42:36.440 --> 01:42:40.440]  What they did is they looked at all the peer-reviewed data, all the same reports that the UN was looking at,
[01:42:40.440 --> 01:42:45.440]  and they exposed the flaws in the United Nations conclusions and in their theory.
[01:42:45.440 --> 01:42:46.440]  And it's not even really a theory anymore.
[01:42:46.440 --> 01:42:48.440]  It's totally discredited.
[01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:53.440]  And that's another point I'll emphasize here, just in case there are any climate alarmists listening.
[01:42:53.440 --> 01:43:00.440]  I mean, the climate alarmists told us that as CO2 concentrations increased in the atmosphere, we were going to see increased global warming.
[01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:04.440]  We have had no global warming in 19 years, according to all five official data sets,
[01:43:04.440 --> 01:43:09.440]  the satellites, the surface data collected by different government agencies around the world.
[01:43:09.440 --> 01:43:11.440]  And so all of their models were wrong.
[01:43:11.440 --> 01:43:14.440]  The UN had 73 models in their last IPCC report.
[01:43:14.440 --> 01:43:17.440]  Every single one of them predicted warming.
[01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:19.440]  A lot of warming, accelerated warming.
[01:43:19.440 --> 01:43:23.440]  As more CO2 went into the atmosphere, instead we've had flat temperatures.
[01:43:23.440 --> 01:43:25.440]  They predicted a melting Antarctic. It's not melting.
[01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:27.440]  It's growing by massive amounts.
[01:43:27.440 --> 01:43:32.440]  They predicted that the oceans were going to become acidified because of CO2 and that things were going to die.
[01:43:32.440 --> 01:43:33.440]  The opposite has happened.
[01:43:33.440 --> 01:43:38.440]  Alex, I said I'd give you the floor, and you're totally on target, like Lord Moncton and Mark Morano and everybody else,
[01:43:38.440 --> 01:43:40.440]  and all the scientists I've had on.
[01:43:40.440 --> 01:43:42.440]  But we know it's a fraud.
[01:43:42.440 --> 01:43:49.440]  Me attacking the fact that they're exempt, they have diplomatic immunity, that Al Gore and all these groups actually get part of our tax money.
[01:43:49.440 --> 01:43:55.440]  For me, looking at this, that's what kills this, is that it's a criminal takeover. It's ridiculous.
[01:43:55.440 --> 01:43:57.440]  I'm sorry. Go ahead.
[01:43:57.440 --> 01:44:03.440]  That's right. Even if the science were correct, which it's not, you know, I challenge everybody to look it up if you have any doubts.
[01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:10.440]  But even if the science were correct, the so-called policy prescriptions are absolute suicide for everybody except the globalists.
[01:44:10.440 --> 01:44:13.440]  Except the Goldman Sachs, the big businesses that are sponsoring this.
[01:44:13.440 --> 01:44:15.440]  And people need to understand that.
[01:44:15.440 --> 01:44:22.440]  We are talking about condemning ourselves to poverty, our children to poverty, and millions, billions of people in the third world.
[01:44:22.440 --> 01:44:27.440]  It's institutionalized serfdom. I'm sorry. It is. It's an institutionalized serfdom.
[01:44:27.440 --> 01:44:31.440]  It's a perfect way to describe it, Alex, because that is where the world we're going toward.
[01:44:31.440 --> 01:44:35.440]  Why is Communist China playing such a big role in these negotiations?
[01:44:35.440 --> 01:44:38.440]  Because that is the kind of model they want for the world.
[01:44:38.440 --> 01:44:46.440]  Outright totalitarianism, no freedom of speech, lots of special privileges for the rulers, lots of oppression for the ruled.
[01:44:46.440 --> 01:44:49.440]  And the climate hoax is a crucial element of the agenda.
[01:44:49.440 --> 01:44:51.440]  It's not the only element, but it's crucial.
[01:44:51.440 --> 01:44:58.440]  When they can demonize carbon dioxide as pollution, they can control and regulate every aspect of our lives.
[01:44:58.440 --> 01:45:04.440]  There is no human activity that doesn't produce carbon dioxide, including me sitting here on this chair and exhaling.
[01:45:04.440 --> 01:45:07.440]  That produces carbon dioxide. Every time you take a breath, that's carbon dioxide.
[01:45:07.440 --> 01:45:13.440]  And they say that is the pollutant, even the New York Times, as you know, admitted six, seven years ago, as a headline, attacks on breathing.
[01:45:13.440 --> 01:45:19.440]  They're actually saying what we exhale is evil. How asinine is that? I mean, this is so obviously anti-human.
[01:45:19.440 --> 01:45:23.440]  That's exactly right. And you know, when I was little, I used to joke they're going to try to tax the air, right?
[01:45:23.440 --> 01:45:27.440]  They're going to try to tax our breathing. And here it is. I'm sitting in Paris, and that's what they're talking about.
[01:45:27.440 --> 01:45:32.440]  Putting a tax on the gas of life that we all exhale.
[01:45:32.440 --> 01:45:40.440]  It's absurd. It's criminal. And it needs to be exposed. And thank you so much, Alex, for what you're doing to bring attention to this issue.
[01:45:40.440 --> 01:45:45.440]  Continue with what you've witnessed, what you've seen, other key points watching this conference.
[01:45:45.440 --> 01:45:49.440]  I mean, please go over all that, but I just want to go back again.
[01:45:49.440 --> 01:45:55.440]  Unelected world government, they admit they're integrating it with the TPP, integrating it with the NAU, the EU.
[01:45:55.440 --> 01:46:02.440]  I mean, this is just a huge transference of power from our already corrupt national governments to totally diplomatically immune
[01:46:02.440 --> 01:46:09.440]  shadow groups of rock stars and movie stars stumbling around with hookers all around them.
[01:46:09.440 --> 01:46:15.440]  I mean, I've been watching the TV telling us how to live. I mean, this is just, this is too rich.
[01:46:15.440 --> 01:46:19.440]  That's right. And it's very evident from the treaty that's come out. It's still got a lot of brackets in it.
[01:46:19.440 --> 01:46:21.440]  They're supposedly negotiating what's going to stay in and come out.
[01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:26.440]  But it's very evident from the treaty that we're going to be giving the United Nations all kinds of new powers.
[01:46:26.440 --> 01:46:32.440]  Every government in the world, national government, especially Western governments, is going to be accountable to this climate regime
[01:46:32.440 --> 01:46:37.440]  and to implement all the measures inside of it, if this is going to be codified into international law.
[01:46:37.440 --> 01:46:46.440]  And if Obama manages to pull off this stunt, adopting a treaty without having to send it ratified and making it binding on the American people,
[01:46:46.440 --> 01:46:49.440]  that includes us as well. So we need to stop it.
[01:46:49.440 --> 01:46:54.440]  And, you know, I think one of the really crucial things that people need to understand, nobody reported this in the media,
[01:46:54.440 --> 01:46:59.440]  but you have an alliance here called G77 plus Communist China, the group of 77.
[01:46:59.440 --> 01:47:05.440]  It's not actually 77. It's 134 governments of different varieties, communist dictators, Islamist dictators,
[01:47:05.440 --> 01:47:08.440]  backwards third world regimes, oppressive dictators.
[01:47:08.440 --> 01:47:12.440]  Wait, are you about to criticize the fact that Saudi Arabia runs the UN Human Rights Commission?
[01:47:12.440 --> 01:47:17.440]  That too. But this G70, the Human Rights Commission, don't even get me started.
[01:47:17.440 --> 01:47:23.440]  Alex, it is such a joke. You put mass murders, genocidal maniacs, communist dictators on a Human Rights Commission.
[01:47:23.440 --> 01:47:26.440]  Why are you being racist against dictators and genocidal maniacs?
[01:47:26.440 --> 01:47:27.440]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:47:27.440 --> 01:47:33.440]  Is that a racist? But no, the G77 plus Communist China here, we've been trying to score an interview with them since we got here.
[01:47:33.440 --> 01:47:37.440]  They won't give it to us. They keep saying, oh, come back later, send us an email, you know, blah, blah, blah.
[01:47:37.440 --> 01:47:43.440]  They don't want to talk to us. But they put out a statement early on this week saying, if you Western governments don't fork over
[01:47:43.440 --> 01:47:50.440]  $100 billion a year to start in climate reparations, and significantly more was the term they used after 2020,
[01:47:50.440 --> 01:47:53.440]  none of this is going anywhere. We're not going to play along here.
[01:47:53.440 --> 01:48:00.440]  So this is an extortion racket. They're demanding massive international wealth redistribution from the poor people in the western country.
[01:48:00.440 --> 01:48:01.440]  You know, middle class people.
[01:48:01.440 --> 01:48:02.440]  This is what they did.
[01:48:02.440 --> 01:48:09.440]  Right. It's a scam. And they want all of this wealth transferred to them under the guise of climate reparations.
[01:48:09.440 --> 01:48:13.440]  All the West emitted carbon dioxide. So, you know, now we had an industrial revolution.
[01:48:13.440 --> 01:48:18.440]  We had technological progress. We developed medicines and agriculture.
[01:48:18.440 --> 01:48:25.440]  And so now for that, now we need to pay them back climate reparations so that their dictatorships can stash their money in the secret bank accounts
[01:48:25.440 --> 01:48:27.440]  and better oppress their people.
[01:48:27.440 --> 01:48:30.440]  It is disgusting that this could be happening.
[01:48:30.440 --> 01:48:34.440]  And it's even more disgusting that the press here is taking this whole sham seriously.
[01:48:34.440 --> 01:48:41.440]  Thank you, Alex, for, you know, just getting the word out there about this. There's so few voices out there that are exposing this hoax for what it is.
[01:48:41.440 --> 01:48:44.440]  I know the American people are catching on to this. It's becoming clear.
[01:48:44.440 --> 01:48:46.440]  We had a poll from Pew last year.
[01:48:46.440 --> 01:48:50.440]  Less than 40% of the American people believe in the anthropogenic global warming theory.
[01:48:50.440 --> 01:48:52.440]  So the American people aren't on board with this.
[01:48:52.440 --> 01:49:00.440]  But to hear it at this conference, the whole world is demanding climate justice and that we all enslave ourselves to this UN climate regime.
[01:49:00.440 --> 01:49:02.440]  And the American people are the key to stopping it.
[01:49:02.440 --> 01:49:07.440]  So everybody who's listening to this needs to get busy, educate yourself, educate your elected officials.
[01:49:07.440 --> 01:49:10.440]  If your elected officials won't listen, replace them.
[01:49:10.440 --> 01:49:14.440]  Now, I'm showing my cell phone on television right now.
[01:49:14.440 --> 01:49:17.440]  My handheld tracking computer is what it really is.
[01:49:17.440 --> 01:49:27.440]  And my dad sent me this a few days ago, so I actually picked one of these December 4th chronicles up and forgot to bring it to work today.
[01:49:27.440 --> 01:49:37.440]  So all I have is the screenshot, but just opening it up and literally spending maybe two minutes at red lights yesterday looking at it.
[01:49:37.440 --> 01:49:41.440]  But again, I do have a screenshot of it to show TV viewers here.
[01:49:41.440 --> 01:49:54.440]  The Chronicle had an article about shaking down super liberal Kirby Lane cafes for money and complaints because two Islamic women were wearing headdresses in there
[01:49:54.440 --> 01:49:59.440]  and claimed somebody said, go back to Saudi Arabia and then they demanded the guy be thrown out.
[01:49:59.440 --> 01:50:02.440]  And Kirby Lane said, sorry, we didn't see him say it.
[01:50:02.440 --> 01:50:06.440]  The manager didn't make a scene, put the guys on the other side of the restaurant.
[01:50:06.440 --> 01:50:08.440]  They were, you know, waiting to be seated.
[01:50:08.440 --> 01:50:09.440]  No proof this even happened.
[01:50:09.440 --> 01:50:11.440]  And it's a big cover story.
[01:50:11.440 --> 01:50:12.440]  Let's skip this network break.
[01:50:12.440 --> 01:50:14.440]  I have to because of time constraints.
[01:50:14.440 --> 01:50:16.440]  And they're making a huge deal of it.
[01:50:16.440 --> 01:50:20.440]  That was one article I wanted to show folks, the big Kirby Lane conspiracy.
[01:50:20.440 --> 01:50:25.440]  So online, just type in Kirby Lane, controversy, Austin Chronicle crew.
[01:50:25.440 --> 01:50:26.440]  We can show it to folks.
[01:50:26.440 --> 01:50:28.440]  I wasn't thinking, hey, we don't have to have the paper.
[01:50:28.440 --> 01:50:29.440]  We have it digitally.
[01:50:29.440 --> 01:50:32.440]  But look at this from the paper, a screenshot, a photo.
[01:50:32.440 --> 01:50:35.440]  New world order throwing it in our face.
[01:50:35.440 --> 01:50:42.440]  This is just wasn't the local paper just just filled with how mothers and fathers are bad and turn your guns in and world government's good.
[01:50:42.440 --> 01:50:43.440]  Watch your language.
[01:50:43.440 --> 01:50:51.440]  Number one recently added to the list of words and phrases to be offensive and officially discouraged on campus.
[01:50:51.440 --> 01:50:57.440]  According to the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee website, because they're God and they say so, political correctness.
[01:50:57.440 --> 01:51:06.440]  The phrase is said to be microaggression that might make some students feel uncomfortable or unsafe if they hear it.
[01:51:06.440 --> 01:51:09.440]  And then it goes on to say, read it on page two.
[01:51:09.440 --> 01:51:16.440]  So they sit there with a straight face, a total cult saying you will not use the word political correctness, even though that's a Soviet term.
[01:51:16.440 --> 01:51:18.440]  They themselves used.
[01:51:18.440 --> 01:51:24.440]  I mean, this shows these people know they're taking over the whole language up at a university in Pennsylvania.
[01:51:24.440 --> 01:51:25.440]  We reported yesterday.
[01:51:25.440 --> 01:51:26.440]  This was mainstream news.
[01:51:26.440 --> 01:51:30.440]  AP reported they there it is breakfast with bigots.
[01:51:30.440 --> 01:51:35.440]  Kirby Lane deals with fallout from customer Islamophobic comments.
[01:51:35.440 --> 01:51:43.440]  This protected group claims someone said something to him at the at the cafes that literally a full of green and orange hair people.
[01:51:43.440 --> 01:51:44.440]  I'm not against Kirby Lane.
[01:51:44.440 --> 01:51:45.440]  It's a fine place to eat.
[01:51:45.440 --> 01:51:46.440]  I go there sometimes.
[01:51:46.440 --> 01:51:48.440]  It's just the point is it's super liberal, super trendy.
[01:51:48.440 --> 01:51:59.440]  And now they have the owners prostrating themselves begging to some made up phantom, probably more made up than the poop swastika or the all the fake other things they've admitted as garbage.
[01:51:59.440 --> 01:52:10.440]  And so but separately, they're in here saying, Alex, you will talk like we talk and you will not use the word political correctness so they can destroy language.
[01:52:10.440 --> 01:52:14.440]  So they can totally and completely dominate everything people are saying.
[01:52:14.440 --> 01:52:20.440]  So now they're saying the name of a study hall is called Lynch Hall after a patron of the school.
[01:52:20.440 --> 01:52:21.440]  Nothing to do with lynching.
[01:52:21.440 --> 01:52:28.440]  It's an Irish name means seaman means boatman means person of the sea means man in longboat really means Viking.
[01:52:28.440 --> 01:52:37.440]  If you go back to the original Gaelic and they want that man saying the word scares them, but they don't want Loretta Lynch, the attorney general to change her name.
[01:52:37.440 --> 01:52:41.440]  This is nothing but exercise of raw cult power.
[01:52:41.440 --> 01:52:44.440]  And even the idiot kids know it's about power.
[01:52:44.440 --> 01:52:53.440]  Even the idiot 20 year olds who are arrested development children know it's about power, even with true liberals at Yale that said we will not ban people having private Halloween parties.
[01:52:53.440 --> 01:53:03.440]  If you're offended by cowboy or an Indian, literally the letter said then you need to just look away because this is what free speech is and they've now resigned.
[01:53:03.440 --> 01:53:13.440]  So this is how free on these little reservations they are where they're growing these pod people to then put them in charge at every level in uniform running our lives.
[01:53:13.440 --> 01:53:14.440]  Sorry, go ahead, Alex.
[01:53:14.440 --> 01:53:18.440]  You know, the language manipulation element of this is crucial.
[01:53:18.440 --> 01:53:23.440]  I think that's one of the ways that they've suckered all these journalists into playing along with this scam.
[01:53:23.440 --> 01:53:26.440]  I can give you just one example of, you know, hundreds.
[01:53:26.440 --> 01:53:28.440]  They talk about all the parties here.
[01:53:28.440 --> 01:53:30.440]  This is the conference of the parties, right?
[01:53:30.440 --> 01:53:31.440]  That's what the cop stands for.
[01:53:31.440 --> 01:53:34.440]  The parties, they keep referring to them as countries.
[01:53:34.440 --> 01:53:36.440]  Now is Raul Castro a country?
[01:53:36.440 --> 01:53:39.440]  Is the mass murdering dictatorship in Beijing a country?
[01:53:39.440 --> 01:53:41.440]  You know, is Robert Mugabe a country?
[01:53:41.440 --> 01:53:42.440]  No, it's a regime.
[01:53:42.440 --> 01:53:44.440]  It's a gang with a flag.
[01:53:44.440 --> 01:53:50.440]  Exactly, these are gangsters and mass murders who've somehow managed to take over a country and oppress the citizens of the country.
[01:53:50.440 --> 01:53:52.440]  So we should stop with the charade.
[01:53:52.440 --> 01:53:53.440]  There's no countries here.
[01:53:53.440 --> 01:53:54.440]  There's government.
[01:53:54.440 --> 01:53:57.440]  There's fake activists that are funded by governments.
[01:53:57.440 --> 01:53:59.440]  There's fake media that are funded by governments.
[01:53:59.440 --> 01:54:03.440]  And there's a bunch of servants to wait on all these people from the government.
[01:54:03.440 --> 01:54:13.440]  So it's just one example of countless that I could cite of how the left and how the United Nations and how the totalitarians are manipulating language and the effect that it has on people.
[01:54:13.440 --> 01:54:22.440]  You know, when you hear that countries are negotiating to save the world from climate change, if you're not well educated, it's easy to be susceptible to this kind of group thing.
[01:54:22.440 --> 01:54:24.440]  Oh, countries, that's wonderful.
[01:54:24.440 --> 01:54:26.440]  Because it's a tissue of lies.
[01:54:26.440 --> 01:54:28.440]  I mean, they're creating an entire atmosphere of baloney.
[01:54:28.440 --> 01:54:30.440]  Our Congress can't even see these agreements.
[01:54:30.440 --> 01:54:31.440]  They're still secret, most of them.
[01:54:31.440 --> 01:54:33.440]  We couldn't see the Copenhagen agreement.
[01:54:33.440 --> 01:54:35.440]  We couldn't see the TPP.
[01:54:35.440 --> 01:54:37.440]  But you just hear, oh, your leaders are there negotiating.
[01:54:37.440 --> 01:54:42.440]  No, criminals are there negotiating personal money of ours to themselves.
[01:54:42.440 --> 01:54:49.440]  Total racketeering, total gangster fraud beyond anything Al Capone could ever imagine.
[01:54:49.440 --> 01:54:51.440]  You're exactly right, Alex.
[01:54:51.440 --> 01:54:53.440]  That's a perfect description of what's happening here.
[01:54:53.440 --> 01:54:54.440]  It's a criminal operation.
[01:54:54.440 --> 01:55:01.440]  They're talking about how they're going to divide up our wealth, how they're going to strip away our liberties, how quickly they're going to implode our economies.
[01:55:01.440 --> 01:55:02.440]  And it's unacceptable.
[01:55:02.440 --> 01:55:06.440]  The people of the world, the actual countries, need to say enough of this scam.
[01:55:06.440 --> 01:55:09.440]  Congress needs to say no more money for Obama's global war.
[01:55:09.440 --> 01:55:10.440]  I mean, wait a minute.
[01:55:10.440 --> 01:55:11.440]  No more money for negotiations.
[01:55:11.440 --> 01:55:17.440]  The world communist beatniks at the Chronicle, the owner, literally makes like $20 million a year, owned South by Southwest.
[01:55:17.440 --> 01:55:25.440]  He says you shouldn't be able to have a car, basically, or a gun, even though he lives in armored palaces and has bodyguards and pays his staff almost nothing.
[01:55:25.440 --> 01:55:28.440]  He says you will use the words he says.
[01:55:28.440 --> 01:55:30.440]  You want to bow down to him right now?
[01:55:30.440 --> 01:55:36.440]  He tried to have my magazines we gave out free banned downtown two years ago.
[01:55:36.440 --> 01:55:41.440]  I mean, shouldn't we just kneel because he has curly long hair and a big belly and go, you're liberal.
[01:55:41.440 --> 01:55:42.440]  We worship you.
[01:55:42.440 --> 01:55:43.440]  You're our God.
[01:55:43.440 --> 01:55:44.440]  We'll talk like you say.
[01:55:44.440 --> 01:55:45.440]  We love your party.
[01:55:45.440 --> 01:55:48.440]  We love the death mills and all the dead babies.
[01:55:48.440 --> 01:55:49.440]  We worship you.
[01:55:49.440 --> 01:55:50.440]  You're the boss.
[01:55:50.440 --> 01:55:51.440]  Absolutely.
[01:55:51.440 --> 01:55:53.440]  You're not a totalitarian freak, control freak.
[01:55:53.440 --> 01:55:55.440]  You're not a giant gang.
[01:55:55.440 --> 01:55:58.440]  You're a bunch of loving liberals because you said so.
[01:55:58.440 --> 01:56:01.440]  I'm sorry, Alex Newman, New American Magazine.
[01:56:01.440 --> 01:56:02.440]  That's right.
[01:56:02.440 --> 01:56:06.440]  The hypocrisy is off the chart here showing up in private jets.
[01:56:06.440 --> 01:56:09.440]  Arnold Schwarzenegger can lecture us about not eating meat.
[01:56:09.440 --> 01:56:10.440]  He said kill yourself.
[01:56:10.440 --> 01:56:12.440]  He said kill yourself.
[01:56:12.440 --> 01:56:13.440]  He said kill yourself.
[01:56:13.440 --> 01:56:17.440]  Head Turner wants to reduce the population of the planet by billions of people.
[01:56:17.440 --> 01:56:19.440]  And then he's got his five children.
[01:56:19.440 --> 01:56:21.440]  I have no problem with him having five children.
[01:56:21.440 --> 01:56:22.440]  That's wonderful.
[01:56:22.440 --> 01:56:23.440]  But don't come over here and start talking about it.
[01:56:23.440 --> 01:56:26.440]  Schwarzenegger has got a bunch of kids out of wedlock.
[01:56:26.440 --> 01:56:31.440]  All the rest of it, each meat all the time, has dozens of jets, hundreds of cars, admittedly.
[01:56:31.440 --> 01:56:32.440]  All these big palaces.
[01:56:32.440 --> 01:56:37.440]  But you shouldn't be able to have meat because he told Rolling Stone in 1978,
[01:56:37.440 --> 01:56:39.440]  I want to be a dictator.
[01:56:39.440 --> 01:56:40.440]  I like Hitler.
[01:56:40.440 --> 01:56:42.440]  I want to tell people what to do.
[01:56:42.440 --> 01:56:43.440]  These are real quotes.
[01:56:43.440 --> 01:56:45.440]  I want to tell you what to do.
[01:56:45.440 --> 01:56:47.440]  I want to be remembered more than Jesus.
[01:56:47.440 --> 01:56:48.440]  I like Hitler.
[01:56:48.440 --> 01:56:53.440]  And he reportedly, to the makers of that film, Pumping Iron,
[01:56:53.440 --> 01:56:58.440]  he literally answers the door in SS uniforms playing records of Hitler's speeches.
[01:56:58.440 --> 01:57:01.440]  I mean, but it's okay because the ADL loves him.
[01:57:01.440 --> 01:57:05.440]  The product of an SS breeding program getting awards from the ADL,
[01:57:05.440 --> 01:57:10.440]  just like they give awards to George Soros, the top living Nazi collaborator.
[01:57:10.440 --> 01:57:11.440]  Yep.
[01:57:11.440 --> 01:57:12.440]  And you know, who else is here?
[01:57:12.440 --> 01:57:13.440]  We saw him yesterday in the hallway.
[01:57:13.440 --> 01:57:17.440]  I tried to chase him down for an interview, but of course he doesn't want to talk to non-propaganda media.
[01:57:17.440 --> 01:57:22.440]  But we have John Holdren here, Obama's science star, the guy who wrote a book saying we need forced abortions,
[01:57:22.440 --> 01:57:26.440]  that we need to put sterilizing agents in the water supply
[01:57:26.440 --> 01:57:29.440]  so that people need to ask permission to have children.
[01:57:29.440 --> 01:57:31.440]  The guy who wants to exterminate people.
[01:57:31.440 --> 01:57:34.440]  The guy who blames record cold and record snow on global warming.
[01:57:34.440 --> 01:57:36.440]  Let me close this here.
[01:57:36.440 --> 01:57:40.440]  Probably enrolling stone while they were in the gym in Venice Beach in front of them.
[01:57:40.440 --> 01:57:42.440]  Down with the blacks.
[01:57:42.440 --> 01:57:44.440]  You're the people not humans.
[01:57:44.440 --> 01:57:50.440]  And meanwhile though, he then joins with the left to dismantle the west.
[01:57:50.440 --> 01:57:51.440]  I mean, you talk about us.
[01:57:51.440 --> 01:57:53.440]  He thinks he can dominate us with Soros.
[01:57:53.440 --> 01:57:56.440]  Well, let me tell you something.
[01:57:56.440 --> 01:57:58.440]  I can look at you and tell that your ticket's about to be punched.
[01:57:58.440 --> 01:58:03.440]  You look like you're warmed over dead and no amount of heart surgeries or anything's going to save you.
[01:58:03.440 --> 01:58:07.440]  You are damned to hatey, Schwarzenegger, if there's any justice in this world.
[01:58:07.440 --> 01:58:12.440]  I'm sorry, but these are sick, demonic, eugenics, schools feeding on us.
[01:58:12.440 --> 01:58:13.440]  I'm sorry.
[01:58:13.440 --> 01:58:14.440]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:58:14.440 --> 01:58:15.440]  You're right, Alex.
[01:58:15.440 --> 01:58:19.440]  And we need to be very clear with our elected officials that this is not going to fly.
[01:58:19.440 --> 01:58:24.440]  The American people need to stand up. We're the last hope for stopping this charade.
[01:58:24.440 --> 01:58:25.440]  Stay there. I'm going to come back to you.
[01:58:25.440 --> 01:58:27.440]  Absolutely. I'm going to come back for five more minutes.
[01:58:27.440 --> 01:58:31.440]  I was just dreaming about being a dictator greater than Jesus.
[01:58:31.440 --> 01:58:33.440]  I want people to be under me.
[01:58:33.440 --> 01:58:35.440]  I want to tell them what to do.
[01:58:35.440 --> 01:58:37.440]  Those are real close, by the way.
[01:58:37.440 --> 01:58:38.440]  I love it.
[01:58:38.440 --> 01:58:39.440]  Sure.
[01:58:41.440 --> 01:58:44.440]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:44.440 --> 01:58:49.440]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:59:14.440 --> 01:59:18.440]  Call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:59:44.440 --> 01:59:48.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:00:14.440 --> 02:00:19.440]  Coming to you right from the front lines of the Info War.
[02:00:19.440 --> 02:00:23.440]  I want you. I need you.
[02:00:23.440 --> 02:00:27.440]  I want you. I need you.
[02:00:27.440 --> 02:00:30.440]  I want you to be my tonight.
[02:00:30.440 --> 02:00:32.440]  You need me.
[02:00:32.440 --> 02:00:34.440]  Mike Norris.
[02:00:34.440 --> 02:00:38.440]  The Accomplished Director, actor.
[02:00:38.440 --> 02:00:41.440]  Progeny of the Great and Mighty.
[02:00:41.440 --> 02:00:44.440]  Mike Norris will be joining us in studio.
[02:00:44.440 --> 02:00:46.440]  I'm a little bit wound up.
[02:00:46.440 --> 02:00:48.440]  Okay. Only one cup of coffee so far today.
[02:00:48.440 --> 02:00:50.440]  But I am wound up right now.
[02:00:50.440 --> 02:00:52.440]  I am wound up.
[02:00:52.440 --> 02:00:54.440]  I am angry. I just, I get upset.
[02:00:54.440 --> 02:00:57.440]  But at the same time, I get happy when I'm fighting tyranny.
[02:00:57.440 --> 02:00:58.440]  So thank you for putting up with me.
[02:00:58.440 --> 02:01:00.440]  I'm going to control myself now.
[02:01:00.440 --> 02:01:03.440]  I'll be totally exhausted by this evening if I continue to bounce all over the walls here.
[02:01:03.440 --> 02:01:05.440]  But that's what's happening.
[02:01:05.440 --> 02:01:15.440]  Jeff, Jim's proposed civil rights free, legal access to enter the U S kit, Daniel's info wars.com.
[02:01:15.440 --> 02:01:17.440]  Senator sessions has released the plan.
[02:01:17.440 --> 02:01:20.440]  That they're planning to put their Congress any alien.
[02:01:20.440 --> 02:01:23.440]  Did I didn't read could file suit to demand entry and claims damages?
[02:01:23.440 --> 02:01:24.440]  That's what the lawyer's made money to for lost employment, lost welfare benefits, lost income.
[02:01:24.440 --> 02:01:29.440]  And they want to let ASUS in will break this down coming up later in the hour.
[02:01:29.440 --> 02:01:32.440]  But, Alex Newman, again, you had the fortune or misfortune of joining me today in the last hour when I was over with the
[02:01:32.440 --> 02:01:38.460]  misfortune of joining me today in the last hour when I was in particular piranha mode.
[02:01:38.460 --> 02:01:39.460]  You're right though.
[02:01:39.460 --> 02:01:40.460]  This is the battle.
[02:01:40.460 --> 02:01:42.300]  The enemy's inside the gates.
[02:01:42.300 --> 02:01:44.120]  It's actually the animating contest of liberty.
[02:01:44.120 --> 02:01:48.840]  What can we do to expose the fact that the entire West is being usurped into an anti-human
[02:01:48.840 --> 02:01:50.960]  eugenics world government as we speak?
[02:01:50.960 --> 02:01:55.160]  I think one of the best things that people can do is first of all educate themselves
[02:01:55.160 --> 02:01:56.960]  and then spread the word.
[02:01:56.960 --> 02:02:01.160]  Share Alex Jones' program through your Twitter, through your Facebook, with your friends.
[02:02:01.160 --> 02:02:02.600]  Share the new Americans' articles.
[02:02:02.600 --> 02:02:06.560]  Get the information out there so that people realize because what I've found, and we've
[02:02:06.560 --> 02:02:09.760]  interviewed a number of people who used to be global warming alarmists, we interviewed
[02:02:09.760 --> 02:02:14.680]  an engineer who quit his job to get involved in stopping global warming until he realized
[02:02:14.680 --> 02:02:16.200]  it was all a fraud.
[02:02:16.200 --> 02:02:17.200]  The facts are compelling.
[02:02:17.200 --> 02:02:18.560]  The truth stands on its own.
[02:02:18.560 --> 02:02:21.160]  Yes, the globalists have billions, trillions of dollars.
[02:02:21.160 --> 02:02:27.400]  Yes, they had control of all the big media and they're the rock stars here.
[02:02:27.400 --> 02:02:28.720]  The truth stands on its own.
[02:02:28.720 --> 02:02:30.200]  We don't need the billions of dollars.
[02:02:30.200 --> 02:02:31.440]  We need the facts.
[02:02:31.440 --> 02:02:32.600]  We need the truth.
[02:02:32.600 --> 02:02:36.160]  With those two weapons, we can stop this scam.
[02:02:36.160 --> 02:02:41.040]  Once the American people are sufficiently educated, we can work with our elected officials.
[02:02:41.040 --> 02:02:42.880]  Congress could very easily stop this.
[02:02:42.880 --> 02:02:46.760]  Every Republican in Congress ran on a platform of stopping Obama.
[02:02:46.760 --> 02:02:48.920]  Now you have an opportunity to stop Obama.
[02:02:48.920 --> 02:02:54.000]  When you pass the budget, say, not one penny of this budget is going to climate negotiation.
[02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:57.640]  Not one penny of this budget is going to the cap and trade that you couldn't even get
[02:02:57.640 --> 02:02:59.920]  through the Democrat-controlled Congress.
[02:02:59.920 --> 02:03:02.640]  Not one penny of this money is going for the gun grab.
[02:03:02.640 --> 02:03:05.240]  Not one penny of this money is going for any of Obama's agenda.
[02:03:05.240 --> 02:03:08.400]  So Republicans who say, oh, we can't do anything, we need to win the White House, they're not
[02:03:08.400 --> 02:03:09.400]  telling the truth.
[02:03:09.400 --> 02:03:10.720]  They control the power of the purse.
[02:03:10.720 --> 02:03:16.000]  So if we get educated, if we educate our communities, if we educate our lawmakers, we can stop
[02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:20.520]  this and we can do it without a lot of work and without a lot of problems.
[02:03:20.520 --> 02:03:25.200]  If we let it continue, if we let it go on until we lose the means of resisting, at that
[02:03:25.200 --> 02:03:27.120]  point, then maybe it's time to start panicking.
[02:03:27.120 --> 02:03:31.320]  But for now, we still have all the opportunities all in the world to put a stop to this.
[02:03:31.320 --> 02:03:35.520]  We have all the necessary tools to resist this and we need to get busy because we can
[02:03:35.520 --> 02:03:36.520]  do it.
[02:03:36.520 --> 02:03:37.520]  Don't squeeze, only tickle.
[02:03:37.520 --> 02:03:38.520]  Right.
[02:03:38.520 --> 02:03:40.520]  There goes Schwarzenegger again.
[02:03:40.520 --> 02:03:41.520]  Right.
[02:03:41.520 --> 02:03:43.240]  And there's a whole bunch of nutty American officials here.
[02:03:43.240 --> 02:03:47.120]  You have the EPA chief here who's the one in charge of implementing all of Obama's
[02:03:47.120 --> 02:03:48.120]  duties.
[02:03:48.120 --> 02:03:49.120]  I didn't want to go off on a straight way.
[02:03:49.120 --> 02:03:52.400]  Schwarzenegger, I mean, I love some of his earlier movies like Running Man and Predator
[02:03:52.400 --> 02:03:56.280]  and Conan the Barbarian is just amazingly not Conan the Destroyer.
[02:03:56.280 --> 02:03:59.200]  Like comedy, but Conan the Barbarian is amazing.
[02:03:59.200 --> 02:04:03.480]  I like Arnold Schwarzenegger as an actor, quite frankly, but as a person, he's an oppressive
[02:04:03.480 --> 02:04:04.560]  evil.
[02:04:04.560 --> 02:04:06.680]  He makes Lance Armstrong look like a humanitarian.
[02:04:06.680 --> 02:04:10.520]  I mean, the stuff he's been involved in, the arrogance, I hate him.
[02:04:10.520 --> 02:04:16.080]  He's just the antithesis of Americana and I literally just won him out of my life.
[02:04:16.080 --> 02:04:20.600]  I mean, he literally is perching on me with immunization, trying to take over all the
[02:04:20.600 --> 02:04:23.560]  major cities and put us under carbon tax one way or the other.
[02:04:23.560 --> 02:04:27.160]  I mean, I'm sure as you know, Alex, he quarterbacks that whole operation.
[02:04:27.160 --> 02:04:28.160]  Yep.
[02:04:28.160 --> 02:04:31.320]  And, you know, he's a good representative for the type of people who are here at this
[02:04:31.320 --> 02:04:32.320]  UN summit.
[02:04:32.320 --> 02:04:35.960]  They're, you know, at least at the upper levels, they're all totalitarian.
[02:04:35.960 --> 02:04:40.760]  They're all incredible hypocrites and they all want to, like Arnold Schwarzenegger, control
[02:04:40.760 --> 02:04:41.760]  your life.
[02:04:41.760 --> 02:04:42.760]  And so people need to understand.
[02:04:42.760 --> 02:04:44.560]  He says he admires Hitler.
[02:04:44.560 --> 02:04:46.320]  Listen, Alex, thank you so much.
[02:04:46.320 --> 02:04:47.320]  Great job.
[02:04:47.320 --> 02:04:50.600]  Those can read your reports without all my screaming, but we need some screaming too
[02:04:50.600 --> 02:04:53.240]  at the new American magazine, newamerican.com.
[02:04:53.240 --> 02:04:54.240]  Thank you so much, brother.
[02:04:54.240 --> 02:04:56.520]  We'll be talking to you again soon after you get back from Paris.
[02:04:56.520 --> 02:04:58.000]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.360]  Mike Norris is coming up.
[02:05:00.360 --> 02:05:01.360]  Red Alert.
[02:05:01.360 --> 02:05:07.280]  Obama brings in 13,000 Muslims who support suicide bombings every year.
[02:05:07.280 --> 02:05:08.280]  Let me explain.
[02:05:08.280 --> 02:05:13.960]  This headline is based upon Pew Research polling data, which is among the most respected polling
[02:05:13.960 --> 02:05:15.480]  firms in the world.
[02:05:15.480 --> 02:05:21.560]  And it is an alarming statistic considering the reality of the Pew Research poll that says
[02:05:21.560 --> 02:05:28.280]  13% of Muslims inside of the United States support suicide bombing, at least some of
[02:05:28.280 --> 02:05:29.280]  the time.
[02:05:29.280 --> 02:05:34.440]  And the U.S. now has over 100,000 Muslims being granted into the country each year.
[02:05:34.440 --> 02:05:40.040]  Meanwhile, Obama continues to mock those of us Americans who are concerned about radical
[02:05:40.040 --> 02:05:42.640]  Muslim refugees entering the country.
[02:05:42.640 --> 02:05:45.000]  Now they're worried about three-year-old orphans.
[02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:50.160]  But facts are facts, regardless of the Obama administration's decision to ignore them.
[02:05:50.160 --> 02:05:56.440]  The radical mindset of the Muslim population in America is here, and it is growing.

[02:05:59.960 --> 02:06:04.680]  My fellow patriots, one of the things I'm most proud of is the fact that the Info Wars

[02:08:08.280 --> 02:08:15.560]  Using a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN
[02:08:15.560 --> 02:08:16.560]  radio network.
[02:08:16.560 --> 02:08:29.080]  If you want some rock and roll intro, buddy, you got a deep purple smoke on the water.
[02:08:29.080 --> 02:08:33.560]  There's an amazing guitar coming up here in just a moment.
[02:08:33.560 --> 02:08:34.560]  Right here.
[02:08:34.560 --> 02:08:39.360]  Butters your Friday, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. central.
[02:08:39.360 --> 02:08:40.360]  We're here live.
[02:08:40.360 --> 02:08:41.360]  Mike Norris, accomplished filmmaker.
[02:08:41.360 --> 02:08:42.360]  Here it is.
[02:08:42.360 --> 02:08:43.360]  It's coming up.
[02:08:43.360 --> 02:08:44.360]  Documentary filmmaker, TV maker, actor.
[02:08:44.360 --> 02:08:45.360]  There's a guitar right there.
[02:08:45.360 --> 02:08:46.360]  And, of course, the firstborn son of Chuck Norris.
[02:08:46.360 --> 02:08:47.360]  It doesn't get any better than that.
[02:08:47.360 --> 02:08:48.360]  And we were very flattered.
[02:08:48.360 --> 02:08:49.360]  Chuck Norris, of course, has been on the show a few times.
[02:08:49.360 --> 02:08:50.360]  I know he is a listener.
[02:08:50.360 --> 02:08:54.360]  And, of course, a nice photo you sent us, and you down there at the ranch with him with
[02:08:54.360 --> 02:08:55.360]  the M4.
[02:08:55.360 --> 02:09:11.720]  Before we get into Amerageddon, premiere this trailer, talk about all the censorship and
[02:09:11.720 --> 02:09:16.760]  things that it has, you know, basically gone through.
[02:09:16.760 --> 02:09:21.880]  What about the idea of drafting Chuck Norris 2016?
[02:09:21.880 --> 02:09:28.960]  And I think he would be even way more invincible and measured in what he said than somebody
[02:09:28.960 --> 02:09:29.960]  like even Donald Trump.
[02:09:29.960 --> 02:09:30.960]  And I like Donald Trump.
[02:09:30.960 --> 02:09:31.960]  He's been on.
[02:09:31.960 --> 02:09:32.960]  He obviously is the big Republican leader.
[02:09:32.960 --> 02:09:35.880]  Or what about a Chuck Norris, Donald Trump, tick him in?
[02:09:35.880 --> 02:09:39.880]  I know your dad is known for being super incredibly humble.
[02:09:39.880 --> 02:09:41.760]  Never have seen him at Republican events over time.
[02:09:41.760 --> 02:09:43.840]  He doesn't like people really complimenting him.
[02:09:43.840 --> 02:09:44.840]  But I mean, come on.
[02:09:44.840 --> 02:09:48.760]  We need somebody who's been a filmmaker, an entrepreneur, you know, world champion,
[02:09:48.760 --> 02:09:54.320]  you know, in karate, in his own right, from Texas or from Oklahoma, you know, who's been
[02:09:54.320 --> 02:09:57.560]  in the military the whole nine yards versus these lawyers.
[02:09:57.560 --> 02:09:58.560]  And Ted Cruz is a lawyer.
[02:09:58.560 --> 02:09:59.560]  I like him.
[02:09:59.560 --> 02:10:02.120]  But I like Rand Paul because he's an optometrist or whatever.
[02:10:02.120 --> 02:10:04.400]  You know, Trump is a self-made billionaire.
[02:10:04.400 --> 02:10:08.840]  I really am just sick of these inside the Beltway people that are smoking their own
[02:10:08.840 --> 02:10:09.840]  dope.
[02:10:09.840 --> 02:10:13.760]  But Mike Norris, before we get into Amerageddon, all things Chuck Norris, you always tell me
[02:10:13.760 --> 02:10:17.160]  some cool stuff behind the scenes baseball and we're going to work at your dad on soon.
[02:10:17.160 --> 02:10:20.040]  But he's really kind of been chilling out right in for world net daily.
[02:10:20.040 --> 02:10:21.760]  And he deserves that.
[02:10:21.760 --> 02:10:25.560]  But wow, I mean, America needs Chuck Norris.
[02:10:25.560 --> 02:10:29.600]  How great would that be to have my dad as a president of the United States?
[02:10:29.600 --> 02:10:36.040]  I mean, it's been great to kind of witness his evolution into the film industry.
[02:10:36.040 --> 02:10:38.440]  But wow, president would be great.
[02:10:38.440 --> 02:10:41.240]  I mean, I'd love to go to the White House to see him there.
[02:10:41.240 --> 02:10:43.760]  How long was he the top grossing action figure ever?
[02:10:43.760 --> 02:10:44.960]  I mean, wasn't like a decade.
[02:10:44.960 --> 02:10:46.440]  He was the top grossing of all time.
[02:10:46.440 --> 02:10:47.440]  Yeah.
[02:10:47.440 --> 02:10:50.720]  Every four months, he'd have a new film come out number one in the box office.
[02:10:50.720 --> 02:10:51.720]  And it was great.
[02:10:51.720 --> 02:10:53.960]  That was, you know, the 80s and 90s.
[02:10:53.960 --> 02:10:58.240]  And then he started on Walker, Texas Ranger, and that just kind of took it to a whole
[02:10:58.240 --> 02:10:59.240]  nether level.
[02:10:59.240 --> 02:11:01.920]  You know, they can say they can have Kamiro clones now.
[02:11:01.920 --> 02:11:06.280]  We could get dig up John Wayne and then your dad could donate some stem cells.
[02:11:06.280 --> 02:11:09.560]  We could create a John Wayne Chuck Norris creature.
[02:11:09.560 --> 02:11:13.640]  I mean, let's throw a little Alex Jones in there too.
[02:11:13.640 --> 02:11:14.640]  No, no, no.
[02:11:14.640 --> 02:11:17.840]  We'll throw Donald Trump's hair in genetically.
[02:11:17.840 --> 02:11:20.120]  The creature will have Donald Trump's hair.
[02:11:20.120 --> 02:11:21.120]  I like his hair.
[02:11:21.120 --> 02:11:22.120]  What's wrong with it?
[02:11:22.120 --> 02:11:23.120]  I hear you.
[02:11:23.120 --> 02:11:24.120]  We'll mix in.
[02:11:24.120 --> 02:11:26.120]  We'll mix in some Elvis.
[02:11:26.120 --> 02:11:29.280]  We'll dig up George Washington and mix in some of that.
[02:11:29.280 --> 02:11:30.280]  Little Ronald Reagan.
[02:11:30.280 --> 02:11:31.280]  Sure.
[02:11:31.280 --> 02:11:33.840]  We won't be mixing any sports vinegar in.
[02:11:33.840 --> 02:11:34.840]  Or Clinton.
[02:11:34.840 --> 02:11:35.840]  Or Clinton.
[02:11:35.840 --> 02:11:36.840]  No.
[02:11:36.840 --> 02:11:37.840]  Hillary though.
[02:11:37.840 --> 02:11:38.840]  So beautiful.
[02:11:38.840 --> 02:11:39.840]  Sorry.
[02:11:39.840 --> 02:11:42.080]  Just spit up a little bit.
[02:11:42.080 --> 02:11:43.520]  But no, I mean, could your dad be convinced?
[02:11:43.520 --> 02:11:45.480]  I mean, I know people brought it up to him.
[02:11:45.480 --> 02:11:46.480]  What would his reservations be?
[02:11:46.480 --> 02:11:49.000]  I mean, give any to running for president?
[02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:56.560]  You know, I think the idea of it is really cool, but, you know, he's, he's so much into
[02:11:56.560 --> 02:11:59.080]  his foundation, his Kickstart Foundation.
[02:11:59.080 --> 02:12:00.080]  Helping kids.
[02:12:00.080 --> 02:12:01.080]  Helping kids.
[02:12:01.080 --> 02:12:04.560]  He's starting a new water company, Seaforce Water.
[02:12:04.560 --> 02:12:09.640]  So he's busy right now, but he's very in tune with what's happening in the world.
[02:12:09.640 --> 02:12:16.040]  He's very in tune with the media, knowing full well the media is the mainstream media
[02:12:16.040 --> 02:12:17.200]  is a lie.
[02:12:17.200 --> 02:12:22.240]  And I think that's, that's important because we need people like you and my father to let
[02:12:22.240 --> 02:12:27.840]  people know Fox, CNN, ABC, NBC, it's all a lie.
[02:12:27.840 --> 02:12:30.520]  And if you really want to get news, where do we go?
[02:12:30.520 --> 02:12:31.520]  We go to Alex.
[02:12:31.520 --> 02:12:32.520]  We go to Drudge.
[02:12:32.520 --> 02:12:33.520]  We go to Breitbart.
[02:12:33.520 --> 02:12:35.920]  That's where we got to go now to get our information.
[02:12:35.920 --> 02:12:38.440]  So is it surprising to you that it came out?
[02:12:38.440 --> 02:12:41.760]  Well, FBI agents and others have said they were blocked from investigating this couple
[02:12:41.760 --> 02:12:45.200]  and that mosque and actually had the Civil Rights Commission from the White House sent
[02:12:45.200 --> 02:12:47.600]  down to stop them.
[02:12:47.600 --> 02:12:48.600]  Ridiculous.
[02:12:48.600 --> 02:12:51.920]  And then now it came out confirmed that the White House ordered the FBI to say this wasn't
[02:12:51.920 --> 02:12:52.920]  terrorism.
[02:12:52.920 --> 02:12:57.240]  Yeah, I watched it kind of unfold.
[02:12:57.240 --> 02:13:02.200]  Interestingly enough, the day Donald was on your show, I'm fixated on watching Donald
[02:13:02.200 --> 02:13:03.480]  Trump on your show.
[02:13:03.480 --> 02:13:06.320]  And then two hours later, this, this thing happens.
[02:13:06.320 --> 02:13:11.280]  I'm watching it unfold and slowly, but surely I'd watch Fox, I'd watch CNN.
[02:13:11.280 --> 02:13:16.400]  But everything from Fox, they'd say his name was a Muslim name.
[02:13:16.400 --> 02:13:21.840]  And then two hours later, CNN would have to, they were Muslims.
[02:13:21.840 --> 02:13:22.840]  It was put there.
[02:13:22.840 --> 02:13:23.840]  But it wasn't terror.
[02:13:23.840 --> 02:13:24.840]  No, no, gosh.
[02:13:24.840 --> 02:13:25.840]  No, it wasn't terror.
[02:13:25.840 --> 02:13:26.840]  Not, not at all.
[02:13:26.840 --> 02:13:31.600]  I mean, vest bombs going to Pakistan and it turns out the government knew order the FBI
[02:13:31.600 --> 02:13:32.600]  to stand down.
[02:13:32.600 --> 02:13:39.280]  To me, how about them letting the media in the apartment one, two days later, cameras
[02:13:39.280 --> 02:13:40.280]  inside the apartment?
[02:13:40.280 --> 02:13:41.280]  That's a crime.
[02:13:41.280 --> 02:13:42.280]  The bed hadn't even been turned.
[02:13:42.280 --> 02:13:43.280]  No.
[02:13:43.280 --> 02:13:44.280]  The walls hadn't been torn out.
[02:13:44.280 --> 02:13:47.400]  Normally in a real attack like this, if they didn't want to get rid of the crime scene,
[02:13:47.400 --> 02:13:49.320]  they would, it'd be close for months.
[02:13:49.320 --> 02:13:50.320]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:13:50.320 --> 02:13:51.320]  Absolutely.
[02:13:51.320 --> 02:13:53.080]  And that's why I named Gary here for this.
[02:13:53.080 --> 02:13:57.360]  I mean, this now, let's talk about the guy that, absolutely, let's get into the film.
[02:13:57.360 --> 02:13:58.360]  Let's talk about Amerageddon.
[02:13:58.360 --> 02:14:01.720]  We're going to be playing the trailer coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[02:14:01.720 --> 02:14:04.440]  The trailer is now at infowars.com.
[02:14:04.440 --> 02:14:08.040]  And let's talk about people like Gary taking action to make this film.
[02:14:08.040 --> 02:14:13.480]  You know, Gary and Diane Haven to me are amazing people.
[02:14:13.480 --> 02:14:19.600]  Here's a guy that has created a successful company, a successful business, has all the
[02:14:19.600 --> 02:14:22.080]  money in the world could do whatever he wants.
[02:14:22.080 --> 02:14:26.520]  And what he has decided to do is he's going to stand up, he's going to put his money up
[02:14:26.520 --> 02:14:31.640]  and he's going to create content, create films that is to expose the elites of the world.
[02:14:31.640 --> 02:14:32.640]  This is just the beginning.
[02:14:32.640 --> 02:14:34.360]  You're ready to announce this.
[02:14:34.360 --> 02:14:35.360]  This is it.
[02:14:35.360 --> 02:14:36.360]  All right.
[02:14:36.360 --> 02:14:37.360]  We'll go ahead and tell folks about it.
[02:14:37.360 --> 02:14:42.160]  We're launching the Facebook for the first time, the website, the trailer, Amerageddon,
[02:14:42.160 --> 02:14:47.040]  themovie.com, links at infowars.com, Facebook, Twitter, will this film save the world by
[02:14:47.040 --> 02:14:48.040]  itself?
[02:14:48.040 --> 02:14:49.040]  No.
[02:14:49.040 --> 02:14:50.040]  Will this show do it by itself?
[02:14:50.040 --> 02:14:51.040]  No.
[02:14:51.040 --> 02:14:52.040]  Will Mike Norris by himself?
[02:14:52.040 --> 02:14:53.040]  No.
[02:14:53.040 --> 02:14:54.040]  Or Chuck Norris at WorldNet Daily?
[02:14:54.040 --> 02:14:55.040]  No.
[02:14:55.040 --> 02:14:58.600]  But all of us together, standing up to the new world order, standing up to what's happening,
[02:14:58.600 --> 02:15:02.800]  the truth will expose what they're doing, and so it's very important that you make this
[02:15:02.800 --> 02:15:04.320]  film a hit.
[02:15:04.320 --> 02:15:06.360]  It's very entertaining, but very informative.
[02:15:06.360 --> 02:15:09.480]  It's very important that when it comes out in theaters, you see it, when it's on demand,
[02:15:09.480 --> 02:15:13.880]  you watch it, that when it then hits DVD, Blu-ray, you get it.
[02:15:13.880 --> 02:15:18.880]  Because we're building an alternative media, and when you come, that's actually what helps
[02:15:18.880 --> 02:15:19.880]  us build it bigger.
[02:15:19.880 --> 02:15:23.080]  It's kind of like fill the dreams, build it, they will come, build something, they will
[02:15:23.080 --> 02:15:27.800]  come, but then you start supporting, it gets bigger and bigger, and that's what the system
[02:15:27.800 --> 02:15:28.800]  is afraid of.
[02:15:28.800 --> 02:15:32.760]  We got those documents from the Clinton Foundation 20 years ago saying we've got to shut down
[02:15:32.760 --> 02:15:33.760]  this Internet.
[02:15:33.760 --> 02:15:37.400]  What happens if Christians and libertarians and conservatives use it?
[02:15:37.400 --> 02:15:38.760]  That'll be it for us.
[02:15:38.760 --> 02:15:43.480]  So the talking point was, call them conspiracy theorists, call them racists, sick the IRS
[02:15:43.480 --> 02:15:47.000]  on them, and 20 years later, what do we see them doing?
[02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:48.000]  Exactly that.
[02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:49.000]  Exactly that.
[02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:51.400]  Getting back to the film, your dad warns you too, didn't he?
[02:15:51.400 --> 02:15:55.840]  But yeah, he did, and he warned me again after he saw the film.
[02:15:55.840 --> 02:16:00.880]  He goes, just so you know, you are now on the list.
[02:16:00.880 --> 02:16:01.880]  What list?
[02:16:01.880 --> 02:16:04.400]  The hit list.
[02:16:04.400 --> 02:16:05.400]  And you know what?
[02:16:05.400 --> 02:16:07.920]  I wear that badge with honor.
[02:16:07.920 --> 02:16:08.920]  Because if I'm doing something-
[02:16:08.920 --> 02:16:10.880]  And he was saying that good, I mean, the good way to you.
[02:16:10.880 --> 02:16:15.760]  He had a good way, hey, I don't want to die for this movie.
[02:16:15.760 --> 02:16:18.600]  And I'm not putting words in your mouth, he told me at the time he said he was proud of
[02:16:18.600 --> 02:16:19.600]  you.
[02:16:19.600 --> 02:16:20.600]  Absolutely.
[02:16:20.600 --> 02:16:21.600]  Absolutely.
[02:16:21.600 --> 02:16:22.600]  He loved the movie.
[02:16:22.600 --> 02:16:29.080]  He had full support on the film, so that's a huge blessing to us.
[02:16:29.080 --> 02:16:30.680]  But today is a big day.
[02:16:30.680 --> 02:16:34.560]  I mean, this is a movie we've been working on for a year and a half.
[02:16:34.560 --> 02:16:39.920]  It's a concept of Gary Havens, who I wish he could be here right now, but he is taking
[02:16:39.920 --> 02:16:42.120]  care of business somewhere in the world.
[02:16:42.120 --> 02:16:43.120]  I don't know.
[02:16:43.120 --> 02:16:45.760]  I'll find out next week when I see him.
[02:16:45.760 --> 02:16:46.760]  But this was his brain-
[02:16:46.760 --> 02:16:48.600]  He's like a James Bond character himself.
[02:16:48.600 --> 02:16:49.720]  He really is.
[02:16:49.720 --> 02:16:54.120]  He is so fascinating, so knowledgeable.
[02:16:54.120 --> 02:16:57.640]  And it's kind of like talking to you, you just kind of get sucked in and-
[02:16:57.640 --> 02:16:58.640]  Oh, you're too nice.
[02:16:58.640 --> 02:16:59.640]  No, but-
[02:16:59.640 --> 02:17:00.640]  He's more interesting than I am.
[02:17:00.640 --> 02:17:03.600]  And he's so knowledgeable and he's so passionate.
[02:17:03.600 --> 02:17:07.400]  And like I said, here's a guy that could have done whatever he wants.
[02:17:07.400 --> 02:17:12.960]  He could go to his island, he's got property everywhere, very well set up.
[02:17:12.960 --> 02:17:16.640]  But this is what he decided, this is important to him.
[02:17:16.640 --> 02:17:22.360]  He wants to expose the corruption, the demonic elite that is really-
[02:17:22.360 --> 02:17:26.040]  I know, having dinner with him and breakfast and stuff with his wife, they are really focused,
[02:17:26.040 --> 02:17:27.720]  they're really serious.
[02:17:27.720 --> 02:17:28.960]  Very serious, very serious.
[02:17:28.960 --> 02:17:29.960]  And-
[02:17:29.960 --> 02:17:32.240]  And he's helped inform Governor Abbott and stuff?
[02:17:32.240 --> 02:17:33.240]  Absolutely.
[02:17:33.240 --> 02:17:34.480]  He is set down with-
[02:17:34.480 --> 02:17:36.680]  All of them, basically.
[02:17:36.680 --> 02:17:38.320]  Pretty much all of them.
[02:17:38.320 --> 02:17:41.960]  And those are his stuff-
[02:17:41.960 --> 02:17:42.960]  Inside baseball as well.
[02:17:42.960 --> 02:17:45.720]  That I wasn't part of, so I don't know exactly what was-
[02:17:45.720 --> 02:17:48.560]  He was just telling me that a lot of people are away now.
[02:17:48.560 --> 02:17:50.680]  Which I pick up on as well, talking to folks.
[02:17:50.680 --> 02:17:55.720]  Yeah, slowly but surely, slowly but surely, and that's why this film of Merrigan is so
[02:17:55.720 --> 02:18:00.280]  important because we get our information in different ways.
[02:18:00.280 --> 02:18:07.120]  I enjoy your show every day, I enjoy movies, I enjoy a lot of movies.
[02:18:07.120 --> 02:18:12.080]  Now one thing that's interesting is Hollywood puts out these kind of movies, but what they
[02:18:12.080 --> 02:18:19.320]  do is they disguise it in animation and they just kind of hit the fringe of what's really
[02:18:19.320 --> 02:18:20.320]  happening.
[02:18:20.320 --> 02:18:22.160]  It's almost like they're wanting us to-
[02:18:22.160 --> 02:18:25.120]  That's a question I had for you.
[02:18:25.120 --> 02:18:28.360]  Ten years ago, you'd see no anti-New World Order stuff now.
[02:18:28.360 --> 02:18:32.360]  Superman, the new Captain America.
[02:18:32.360 --> 02:18:38.600]  So many of these plots are false flags, corrupt groups, folks say it's like my show.
[02:18:38.600 --> 02:18:39.600]  What do you think that's about?
[02:18:39.600 --> 02:18:41.320]  No, I think you're 100% right.
[02:18:41.320 --> 02:18:46.760]  I think what they're trying to do is dumb us down, desensitize us to what's really happening.
[02:18:46.760 --> 02:18:52.160]  So when it does take place, it's like, okay, well it's here, we kind of saw it coming.
[02:18:52.160 --> 02:18:53.880]  Well, I don't buy that.
[02:18:53.880 --> 02:18:55.160]  They're taking the edge off.
[02:18:55.160 --> 02:18:58.280]  They're taking the edge off and a lot of people are buying it.
[02:18:58.280 --> 02:19:04.080]  What we're doing with Merrigan is we've just ripped off all the shiny, pretty stuff that
[02:19:04.080 --> 02:19:06.440]  they put in their films and we just tell the truth.
[02:19:06.440 --> 02:19:11.920]  We call out who we need to call out and we tell a story within the confines of what's
[02:19:11.920 --> 02:19:13.480]  going on in the world.
[02:19:13.480 --> 02:19:14.480]  It's-
[02:19:14.480 --> 02:19:15.480]  Get the break.
[02:19:15.480 --> 02:19:16.480]  Sorry.
[02:19:16.480 --> 02:19:24.120]  Yeah, really what it's about is us taking our freedom back from the government.
[02:19:24.120 --> 02:19:25.120]  That's what we need to do.
[02:19:25.120 --> 02:19:26.640]  The government is running our lives.
[02:19:26.640 --> 02:19:29.800]  We're taking our freedom back.
[02:19:29.800 --> 02:19:31.160]  And ideas are bulletproof.
[02:19:31.160 --> 02:19:32.160]  This is revolutionary.
[02:19:32.160 --> 02:19:38.320]  I've seen no exaggerations since I'm on air 20-something years, more than 30 or 40 made
[02:19:38.320 --> 02:19:42.800]  for TV shows, other films where it's always a radio host in a bunker leading a revolution
[02:19:42.800 --> 02:19:46.480]  against the government, blowing up schools full of children, and in a lot of the shows
[02:19:46.480 --> 02:19:52.320]  that he's even named Alex, or it'll say from Texas, Alex Johnson, and then I'm killing
[02:19:52.320 --> 02:19:58.560]  everyone, and that's just them attacking me and others, they've got shows where Green
[02:19:58.560 --> 02:20:03.440]  Lantern fights guys with tri-corner hats that want to put poison in the New York Bay.
[02:20:03.440 --> 02:20:10.440]  I mean, they just everywhere are demonizing patriots and going after us, so you're basically
[02:20:10.440 --> 02:20:14.920]  countering them, but not with hidden propaganda, you're just putting it right out there against
[02:20:14.920 --> 02:20:15.920]  them.
[02:20:15.920 --> 02:20:17.840]  Right out in your face.
[02:20:17.840 --> 02:20:26.360]  It is like Gary likes to say, this is a true story that hasn't happened yet, but it will,
[02:20:26.360 --> 02:20:27.360]  but it will.
[02:20:27.360 --> 02:20:31.200]  If you look at Europe, they've used the radical Islamic invasion, they brought in, they advertised
[02:20:31.200 --> 02:20:37.480]  to declare civil emergency and draconian martial law laws in Germany and France, where they
[02:20:37.480 --> 02:20:41.880]  ban demonstrations of nationalist groups, but then let the socialists run around the
[02:20:41.880 --> 02:20:42.880]  streets.
[02:20:42.880 --> 02:20:47.320]  Yeah, yeah, it was in full display of what was going on with the military in the streets
[02:20:47.320 --> 02:20:50.040]  and locking down the streets, martial law.
[02:20:50.040 --> 02:20:53.400]  It is coming, it's just a matter of time.
[02:20:53.400 --> 02:20:58.000]  When they misrepresent, we come out and say, hey, here's this Jade Helm, Army.mil.
[02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:00.080]  They say it's, you know, practicing to take over hostile areas.
[02:21:00.080 --> 02:21:03.440]  We don't believe this is an imminent takeover, but it's more conditioning of our troops to
[02:21:03.440 --> 02:21:04.440]  accept this.
[02:21:04.440 --> 02:21:05.440]  They spin it.
[02:21:05.440 --> 02:21:06.440]  Alex Jones hates the military.
[02:21:06.440 --> 02:21:10.440]  He says they're coming to Texas this summer to kill everybody and take their guns.
[02:21:10.440 --> 02:21:13.400]  And then since they put that out, people don't trust the government.
[02:21:13.400 --> 02:21:18.280]  They get scared from what hundreds of newspapers and TV stations said, they get scared by the
[02:21:18.280 --> 02:21:22.960]  media saying that and believe it's happening because my name's attached to it.
[02:21:22.960 --> 02:21:24.480]  And then they come out and say, see, it didn't happen.
[02:21:24.480 --> 02:21:25.480]  Alex Jones was a liar.
[02:21:25.480 --> 02:21:29.040]  And when I'm not talking about myself here, folks, you seem to know these are the tricks
[02:21:29.040 --> 02:21:30.040]  they engage in.
[02:21:30.040 --> 02:21:31.040]  Yeah.
[02:21:31.040 --> 02:21:32.040]  No, I agree with you.
[02:21:32.040 --> 02:21:35.840]  I agree with you 100% there.
[02:21:35.840 --> 02:21:39.960]  It's crazy the rabbit hole they're trying to push us down in.
[02:21:39.960 --> 02:21:40.960]  I'm done.
[02:21:40.960 --> 02:21:49.480]  I was always kind of a quiet, you know, I didn't want to jump off the cliff 100%.
[02:21:49.480 --> 02:21:51.160]  I wanted to hold back a little bit.
[02:21:51.160 --> 02:21:56.600]  I had my views, I believe everything you're talking about, but I was just holding back.
[02:21:56.600 --> 02:22:00.320]  And it's not until now where we really need to make that choice.
[02:22:00.320 --> 02:22:01.800]  Are we in or are we out?
[02:22:01.800 --> 02:22:03.440]  Because you can't play in the middle.
[02:22:03.440 --> 02:22:06.120]  If you get played in the middle, you're dead.
[02:22:06.120 --> 02:22:10.000]  Never true words have been spoken than what you just said, Mike Norris.
[02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:13.240]  I always think about the fact I've got to intensify what I'm doing, work even harder
[02:22:13.240 --> 02:22:14.560]  or I got to completely quit.
[02:22:14.560 --> 02:22:18.360]  I can't just back off halfway or back off 80%.
[02:22:18.360 --> 02:22:19.360]  And then it's a choice.
[02:22:19.360 --> 02:22:20.720]  I mean, I could take my children fishing and hunting more.
[02:22:20.720 --> 02:22:23.760]  I could be in better shape, though I'm trying to get back in better shape, but I've just
[02:22:23.760 --> 02:22:24.760]  made the choice.
[02:22:24.760 --> 02:22:25.760]  I'm all in.
[02:22:25.760 --> 02:22:26.760]  I'm 100% committed.
[02:22:26.760 --> 02:22:27.760]  That's it.
[02:22:27.760 --> 02:22:28.760]  I'm done.
[02:22:28.760 --> 02:22:29.760]  I couldn't do it any other way.
[02:22:29.760 --> 02:22:31.120]  Yeah, no, I agree with you.
[02:22:31.120 --> 02:22:36.000]  And that's why it's so important on this film that we get the support, that we get the people
[02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:43.080]  to go to the Amerageddon Facebook page, the Amerageddon, the film website to really support
[02:22:43.080 --> 02:22:45.160]  us because this is it.
[02:22:45.160 --> 02:22:51.240]  We are going full in to create content that is going to expose what is happening behind
[02:22:51.240 --> 02:22:52.240]  the scenes.
[02:22:52.240 --> 02:22:53.840]  And there is a demonic elite.
[02:22:53.840 --> 02:22:57.080]  And I really believe it's a spiritual warfare.
[02:22:57.080 --> 02:23:00.800]  Behind it all, there is a spiritual warfare going on that is dictating what's happening.
[02:23:00.800 --> 02:23:03.320]  I want to talk more about that right now and then come back and play the trailer.
[02:23:03.320 --> 02:23:05.080]  We just skipped this network break.
[02:23:05.080 --> 02:23:06.600]  You're just announcing the trailer today.
[02:23:06.600 --> 02:23:07.680]  You're just launching it.
[02:23:07.680 --> 02:23:10.800]  The Facebook just got launched minutes ago, 300 or something likes.
[02:23:10.800 --> 02:23:14.440]  I want to put up the top of our main Facebook that has a million followers and the others
[02:23:14.440 --> 02:23:19.040]  that have several million as well, Twitter, everywhere, but I want to ask listeners, you
[02:23:19.040 --> 02:23:20.040]  have the real power.
[02:23:20.040 --> 02:23:22.680]  When I get up here and push something, yeah, it reaches a few million people.
[02:23:22.680 --> 02:23:26.640]  If you don't decide to take action and carry that ball, it does nothing.
[02:23:26.640 --> 02:23:32.680]  I want to see 5 million views, 10 million views conservatively by next week on the Amerageddon
[02:23:32.680 --> 02:23:33.680]  trailer.
[02:23:33.680 --> 02:23:41.000]  I want to see a couple hundred thousand likes per minimum on the Amerageddon Facebook and
[02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:48.480]  on the website because again, this is about creating patriot, anti-globalist markets for
[02:23:48.480 --> 02:23:52.840]  this type of material and if this is even moderately successful, then they're going
[02:23:52.840 --> 02:23:57.440]  to commit to a flotilla of not just these films, but other films, we've been talking
[02:23:57.440 --> 02:23:59.560]  behind the scenes, a lot of stuff.
[02:23:59.560 --> 02:24:04.480]  This is about leaving Hollywood, leaving the censorship and really putting your money
[02:24:04.480 --> 02:24:05.480]  where your mouth is.
[02:24:05.480 --> 02:24:10.760]  I mean, it's hard to have jets and helicopters and full, I mean, how big was this budget?
[02:24:10.760 --> 02:24:11.760]  Millions and millions of dollars.
[02:24:11.760 --> 02:24:15.200]  We're not going to say.
[02:24:15.200 --> 02:24:21.080]  Mr. Haven was very generous, but he is very smart and so we had some guidelines, but
[02:24:21.080 --> 02:24:23.840]  I had everything I needed to make this film.
[02:24:23.840 --> 02:24:29.040]  Well, I mean, I've been on some pretty big films and as a consultant, but also in them,
[02:24:29.040 --> 02:24:32.320]  you know, fell into some link letter films he invited me to be in and this was bigger
[02:24:32.320 --> 02:24:35.160]  crews and budgets and it was pretty professional.
[02:24:35.160 --> 02:24:38.480]  Yeah, we had a great time, a great crew.
[02:24:38.480 --> 02:24:41.960]  You know, and it's interesting because a lot of the people that just came on to work
[02:24:41.960 --> 02:24:45.160]  on the film are getting really skittish right now.
[02:24:45.160 --> 02:24:46.360]  I've had phone calls.
[02:24:46.360 --> 02:24:48.680]  Could you change my name in the credits?
[02:24:48.680 --> 02:24:51.640]  By the way, because you guys got a bunch of big actors and actresses.
[02:24:51.640 --> 02:24:52.640]  Tell folks.
[02:24:52.640 --> 02:24:55.480]  Yeah, yeah, we've got Deanna Meyer, Anna Lynn McCord.
[02:24:55.480 --> 02:24:58.960]  We have got the awesome Marshall Teague.
[02:24:58.960 --> 02:25:02.000]  Marshall Teague to me is one of the most brilliant actors.
[02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:03.000]  We've got this guy.
[02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:04.680]  He played a great part.
[02:25:04.680 --> 02:25:05.680]  Alex Jones.
[02:25:05.680 --> 02:25:06.680]  Not about me.
[02:25:06.680 --> 02:25:07.680]  This is a movie.
[02:25:07.680 --> 02:25:13.160]  No, but what was awesome about that was we go, can you play something different?
[02:25:13.160 --> 02:25:15.000]  We want you to play the bad guy.
[02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:18.760]  We want you to be the enemy and you pulled it off with mastery.
[02:25:18.760 --> 02:25:19.760]  Oh, you're nice.
[02:25:19.760 --> 02:25:25.240]  It was it was certainly fun and I just would love to do it again.
[02:25:25.240 --> 02:25:29.840]  Now let's get into the demonic nature of all of this with Mike Norris, the film, Amerageddon,
[02:25:29.840 --> 02:25:34.240]  Amerageddon, the movie.com folks put it on your Facebook, on your Twitter, please send
[02:25:34.240 --> 02:25:36.200]  it out to your friends and family.
[02:25:36.200 --> 02:25:39.200]  These guys have really committed to do this and you don't want to get a lot into it on
[02:25:39.200 --> 02:25:41.280]  the air because it sounds like whining or complaining.
[02:25:41.280 --> 02:25:42.280]  It's a badge of courage.
[02:25:42.280 --> 02:25:45.080]  Before we get into the demonic stuff, which we'll do after the break.
[02:25:45.080 --> 02:25:46.080]  Talk about the censorship.
[02:25:46.080 --> 02:25:50.720]  I mean, people don't know that Homeland Security visited a major TV network that I was doing
[02:25:50.720 --> 02:25:55.040]  a show with and actually threatened them and I'm not allowed to say what else happened
[02:25:55.040 --> 02:25:58.440]  and it really makes me mad, but I was told in confidence so I can't tell you.
[02:25:58.440 --> 02:26:03.960]  But it was bad and then I mean, people don't know what goes on behind the scenes to shut
[02:26:03.960 --> 02:26:04.960]  stuff down.
[02:26:04.960 --> 02:26:07.760]  I've been thrown off XM, thrown off a bunch of affiliates.
[02:26:07.760 --> 02:26:09.080]  The stations get threatened.
[02:26:09.080 --> 02:26:10.080]  People coming off for money.
[02:26:10.080 --> 02:26:14.000]  I mean, hundreds of thousands of dollars just for a few months just to get me off.
[02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:17.240]  I mean, there is a real move in this country.
[02:26:17.240 --> 02:26:20.720]  So understand, you, that's why I have kinship with Donald Trump.
[02:26:20.720 --> 02:26:25.360]  I know what it's like, not at his level, to be surrounded by wolves, shoving their knives
[02:26:25.360 --> 02:26:26.360]  in you.
[02:26:26.360 --> 02:26:28.800]  You're in the arena and all these people are up there in the stands saying how you, how
[02:26:28.800 --> 02:26:30.560]  we should do this, how we should do that.
[02:26:30.560 --> 02:26:31.560]  It doesn't matter.
[02:26:31.560 --> 02:26:32.560]  He's in the arena.
[02:26:32.560 --> 02:26:33.560]  It makes me respecting.
[02:26:33.560 --> 02:26:34.560]  You are in the arena.
[02:26:34.560 --> 02:26:35.560]  You're in the arena.
[02:26:35.560 --> 02:26:36.560]  You're in the arena.
[02:26:36.560 --> 02:26:37.560]  You're in the arena.
[02:26:37.560 --> 02:26:38.560]  Can you tell folks?
[02:26:38.560 --> 02:26:40.040]  I mean, you're not just saying, oh, this is being censored.
[02:26:40.040 --> 02:26:41.040]  Oh, they don't want it out.
[02:26:41.040 --> 02:26:43.920]  Oh, they won't distribute it, blah, blah, blah.
[02:26:43.920 --> 02:26:46.640]  I mean, Mike Judge told me and he's, everything he's done is going to hit.
[02:26:46.640 --> 02:26:47.920]  He's made billions of dollars.
[02:26:47.920 --> 02:26:50.680]  He told me and he's, I'm allowed to say it.
[02:26:50.680 --> 02:26:54.760]  When Fox saw Idiocracy, they said, this will, this would be a hit.
[02:26:54.760 --> 02:26:57.280]  And by the way, they had a contract to make him make three movies.
[02:26:57.280 --> 02:26:58.280]  He was busy.
[02:26:58.280 --> 02:26:59.280]  Didn't want to do it.
[02:26:59.280 --> 02:27:01.480]  They said, we're not even going to list this or show this in theaters.
[02:27:01.480 --> 02:27:02.880]  Remember, it had all this hype.
[02:27:02.880 --> 02:27:03.880]  Everybody wanted to see it.
[02:27:03.880 --> 02:27:07.000]  This huge hit in DVDs made hundreds of millions of dollars.
[02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:10.840]  Now, they killed it because it showed how the public was being dumbed down and wasn't
[02:27:10.840 --> 02:27:12.280]  a message they wanted.
[02:27:12.280 --> 02:27:13.280]  That's how controlled it is.
[02:27:13.280 --> 02:27:14.440]  So I'm kind of ranting about it.
[02:27:14.440 --> 02:27:16.280]  I have hundreds of these stories.
[02:27:16.280 --> 02:27:19.120]  Folks don't understand that Mike Judge came on the show, gave his only political interview
[02:27:19.120 --> 02:27:20.120]  ever.
[02:27:20.120 --> 02:27:23.680]  And he said, I hope I don't get audited by the IRS for saying this, but they basically
[02:27:23.680 --> 02:27:28.200]  tell people in Hollywood, you keep your mouth shut or you'll never work again.
[02:27:28.200 --> 02:27:31.440]  And it doesn't matter if you've made $3 billion like Mike Judge.
[02:27:31.440 --> 02:27:32.440]  Go ahead.
[02:27:32.440 --> 02:27:33.440]  Yeah.
[02:27:33.440 --> 02:27:36.960]  So we ran into that.
[02:27:36.960 --> 02:27:41.640]  In Hollywood, sent out the screeners, everybody goes, ooh, really good film.
[02:27:41.640 --> 02:27:45.720]  Not one person would touch it, even though every one of them said, this thing is going
[02:27:45.720 --> 02:27:47.680]  to get a lot of support.
[02:27:47.680 --> 02:27:49.720]  Not one studio would touch it.
[02:27:49.720 --> 02:27:52.840]  So Gary said, you know what, forget it, we'll do it ourselves.
[02:27:52.840 --> 02:27:57.880]  And so that's why we're going to open this film March 2nd in theaters in Texas on Texas
[02:27:57.880 --> 02:27:59.920]  Independence Day.
[02:27:59.920 --> 02:28:06.360]  And it's just so important that it's us, it's me, it's you that come out and support this
[02:28:06.360 --> 02:28:08.360]  film.
[02:28:08.360 --> 02:28:12.160]  I cannot emphasize that enough that all of us rally together.
[02:28:12.160 --> 02:28:15.120]  We become an army of one and we support this film.
[02:28:15.120 --> 02:28:18.960]  And other films that will come out like it, very important.
[02:28:18.960 --> 02:28:20.160]  We're on an island.
[02:28:20.160 --> 02:28:21.240]  We're fighting a war.
[02:28:21.240 --> 02:28:22.240]  We are fighting a war.
[02:28:22.240 --> 02:28:25.840]  So we got to stick together, everyone.
[02:28:25.840 --> 02:28:26.840]  Absolutely.
[02:28:26.840 --> 02:28:29.880]  And look, you've got all these big TV shows, movies.
[02:28:29.880 --> 02:28:30.880]  We're not doing this for money.
[02:28:30.880 --> 02:28:32.000]  Remember, we talked behind the scenes.
[02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:35.440]  You've got more work that you could ever deal with with all the TV shows you produced,
[02:28:35.440 --> 02:28:37.040]  not just Walker and the rest of it.
[02:28:37.040 --> 02:28:40.760]  I mean, you knew you would get further black mold for doing this, but it was almost just
[02:28:40.760 --> 02:28:41.880]  the challenge to do it.
[02:28:41.880 --> 02:28:42.880]  Now you've done it.
[02:28:42.880 --> 02:28:45.040]  And it's, it's better than I thought it'd be with the budget.
[02:28:45.040 --> 02:28:47.520]  I mean, some parts of it look like beyond the Godfather.
[02:28:47.520 --> 02:28:48.520]  They're so good.
[02:28:48.520 --> 02:28:50.800]  Other parts that, you know, are fun, but better than TV.
[02:28:50.800 --> 02:28:53.960]  I mean, that's my real review of the content is five star.
[02:28:53.960 --> 02:28:56.760]  I mean, I'm really honored to be involved in this.
[02:28:56.760 --> 02:28:57.760]  Yeah.
[02:28:57.760 --> 02:28:58.760]  I appreciate that.
[02:28:58.760 --> 02:29:05.040]  And this is, you know, Gary just put in so much time and effort into every word that
[02:29:05.040 --> 02:29:06.400]  is in this film.
[02:29:06.400 --> 02:29:08.600]  We speak on the second amendment.
[02:29:08.600 --> 02:29:10.720]  We speak on the government coming to take our weapon.
[02:29:10.720 --> 02:29:14.240]  You lay out the whole blueprint, everything, everything.
[02:29:14.240 --> 02:29:19.640]  Before this all started, I was in the dark and I'm thinking, what on earth is Gary thinking
[02:29:19.640 --> 02:29:20.880]  here?
[02:29:20.880 --> 02:29:25.120]  But the more I research it, then that's when I start figuring out, holy crap.
[02:29:25.120 --> 02:29:26.120]  Well, that's what you said at first.
[02:29:26.120 --> 02:29:28.920]  You were kind of ambivalent by the time you were making it, you liked it, now you love
[02:29:28.920 --> 02:29:29.920]  it.
[02:29:29.920 --> 02:29:30.920]  Love it.
[02:29:30.920 --> 02:29:31.920]  I'm in.
[02:29:31.920 --> 02:29:32.920]  I'm sold.
[02:29:32.920 --> 02:29:33.920]  High five, baby.
[02:29:33.920 --> 02:29:37.960]  When we come back with Mike Norris, there it is, the first born progeny of the great
[02:29:37.960 --> 02:29:39.160]  King Norris in front of us.
[02:29:39.160 --> 02:29:42.040]  I know, I know your dad's probably listening and getting mad at me being goofy.
[02:29:42.040 --> 02:29:43.040]  That's what I do though.
[02:29:43.040 --> 02:29:46.480]  We're going to be right back, ladies and gentlemen, to play the trailer and get into other world
[02:29:46.480 --> 02:29:49.520]  news with Mike Norris, the film of Marageddon.
[02:29:49.520 --> 02:29:56.000]  We're on the march, the empires on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[02:29:56.000 --> 02:30:05.040]  Anti-gunners are planning a very pungent protest this weekend in Austin, Texas.
[02:30:05.040 --> 02:30:10.360]  In response to pro-CCL activists staging a mock mass shooting, counter demonstrators
[02:30:10.360 --> 02:30:13.560]  will resort to waving dildos and mass farting.
[02:30:13.560 --> 02:30:18.440]  Yes, this is the self-defense equivalent of peeing yourself to stop a rape.
[02:30:18.440 --> 02:30:23.040]  With cardboard guns and fake blood, come and take it, Texas and don't comply.com are
[02:30:23.040 --> 02:30:26.760]  pitching a life and liberty event to end gun-free zones.
[02:30:26.760 --> 02:30:31.040]  The active shooter drill will take place near the University of Texas this Saturday, but
[02:30:31.040 --> 02:30:34.160]  this time, the shooter picks the wrong crowd.
[02:30:34.160 --> 02:30:38.280]  The planned event comes at a particularly tense time in the nation's gun debate and
[02:30:38.280 --> 02:30:42.640]  Texas colleges and universities are debating how to implement the state's new campus carry
[02:30:42.640 --> 02:30:45.160]  law that will start next fall.
[02:30:45.160 --> 02:30:50.480]  But gun control advocates say this event is offensive and so they're staging a mass farting
[02:30:50.480 --> 02:30:53.320]  and dildo-waving counter-protest.
[02:30:53.320 --> 02:30:55.880]  I fart in your general direction.
[02:30:55.880 --> 02:31:00.240]  Read more about this event at infowars.com.
[02:31:00.240 --> 02:31:06.360]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits
[02:31:06.360 --> 02:31:07.360]  of silver.

[02:31:59.520 --> 02:32:00.520]  I want more candy.
[02:32:00.520 --> 02:32:01.520]  I want more candy.
[02:32:01.520 --> 02:32:02.520]  I want more candy.
[02:32:02.520 --> 02:32:03.520]  Why, why, why?
[02:32:03.520 --> 02:32:07.640]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true
[02:32:07.640 --> 02:32:12.560]  nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[02:32:12.560 --> 02:32:15.320]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[02:32:15.320 --> 02:32:20.680]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it, young humans have not yet developed
[02:32:20.680 --> 02:32:25.240]  their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[02:32:25.240 --> 02:32:29.600]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic
[02:32:29.600 --> 02:32:30.600]  drugs.
[02:32:30.600 --> 02:32:34.680]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients
[02:32:34.680 --> 02:32:36.720]  that children would actually like and take.
[02:32:36.720 --> 02:32:40.280]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for
[02:32:40.280 --> 02:32:44.880]  children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there, introducing
[02:32:44.880 --> 02:32:50.360]  child ease with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential
[02:32:50.360 --> 02:32:52.400]  nutrients that taste great.
[02:32:52.400 --> 02:32:55.680]  Obtain your child ease today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:32:55.680 --> 02:33:24.200]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[02:33:24.200 --> 02:33:31.960]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:33:31.960 --> 02:33:36.800]  The reason I'm here today is to encourage the U.S. Congress to take action to protect
[02:33:36.800 --> 02:33:40.520]  our country from its most imminent threat.
[02:33:40.520 --> 02:33:41.520]  Electricity would cease.
[02:33:41.520 --> 02:33:45.120]  The Internet would go down out of the banking system.
[02:33:45.120 --> 02:33:50.280]  The smoke screen of national security used by government at every level.
[02:33:50.280 --> 02:33:56.080]  Strong America is the only thing standing in the way, country only needs a little chaos.
[02:33:56.080 --> 02:34:00.280]  We have a fog that is suspended on our entire nation.
[02:34:00.280 --> 02:34:02.800]  Hello, Mr. President.
[02:34:02.800 --> 02:34:05.160]  Now is the time.
[02:34:05.160 --> 02:34:08.440]  The average American family only has three days of food.
[02:34:08.440 --> 02:34:09.920]  We need to talk face to face.
[02:34:09.920 --> 02:34:10.920]  This is important.
[02:34:10.920 --> 02:34:12.560]  So what's the mission?
[02:34:12.560 --> 02:34:15.440]  Disarm the population and restore order.
[02:34:15.440 --> 02:34:18.400]  Have any weapons inside your home or on your personal.
[02:34:18.400 --> 02:34:24.920]  We had to give the president power to arrest any American by simply accusing them of terrorism.
[02:34:24.920 --> 02:34:30.440]  The vanity of nationalism will quickly fade, ease up at the birth pangs of a new world
[02:34:30.440 --> 02:34:31.440]  order.
[02:34:31.440 --> 02:34:35.400]  I'm just so afraid of the world that you're going to have to grow up.
[02:34:35.400 --> 02:34:38.920]  This is the time man, woman, young are all.
[02:34:38.920 --> 02:34:46.040]  When folks run and hide or they pull up their bootstraps and they fight.
[02:34:46.040 --> 02:34:55.000]  When you sell your soul to one time thing, there's no going back.
[02:34:55.000 --> 02:35:00.040]  American and it hits theaters coming up on March 2nd, Texas Independence Day.
[02:35:00.040 --> 02:35:02.080]  And we need to get around this Hollywood blockade.
[02:35:02.080 --> 02:35:06.840]  If it sells out the first few days in the theaters where it opens in Texas, that will
[02:35:06.840 --> 02:35:11.400]  then break the blockade just like we did with America 2016 and the rest of it.
[02:35:11.400 --> 02:35:15.520]  And again, I wasn't making money off America 2016, but I helped promote it, helped push
[02:35:15.520 --> 02:35:19.280]  it just as you did to make sure it got around the censors and had a big effect.
[02:35:19.280 --> 02:35:21.080]  They, of course, arrested Dinesh and Suza.
[02:35:21.080 --> 02:35:23.440]  Then we talk about the censorship and the stuff that goes on.
[02:35:23.440 --> 02:35:26.400]  They basically told him we're doing this because of your film and the next film that
[02:35:26.400 --> 02:35:27.400]  was coming out.
[02:35:27.400 --> 02:35:29.240]  They want to intimidate people.
[02:35:29.240 --> 02:35:30.400]  They want to shut people down.
[02:35:30.400 --> 02:35:34.800]  They sent him for psychological psychiatric evaluation for nine months after he was in
[02:35:34.800 --> 02:35:37.960]  prison over campaign issues.
[02:35:37.960 --> 02:35:41.120]  And even the psychiatrist laughed and said this is all political persecution.
[02:35:41.120 --> 02:35:45.360]  So the good news is there's good people throughout the system that know this is a fraud, but
[02:35:45.360 --> 02:35:49.000]  they don't want you to see Amerageddon.
[02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:51.560]  They don't want to harden the EMP shield.
[02:35:51.560 --> 02:35:55.000]  They don't want to have this country be strong.
[02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:59.680]  So on everybody to go to Amerageddon there on Facebook, we're going to send the link
[02:35:59.680 --> 02:36:00.680]  out.
[02:36:00.680 --> 02:36:03.160]  We're going to send out the trailer to everybody.
[02:36:03.160 --> 02:36:05.200]  We're going to put it on Facebook, Twitter.
[02:36:05.200 --> 02:36:10.920]  It is very, very important that this film trailer go viral because it's about alternative
[02:36:10.920 --> 02:36:12.760]  media, alternative culture.
[02:36:12.760 --> 02:36:16.480]  Amerageddon exclusive release, powerful film exposes globalist takeover plan.
[02:36:16.480 --> 02:36:18.600]  And we're going to retweet it over the weekend.
[02:36:18.600 --> 02:36:21.080]  Film exposes military training to confiscate guns.
[02:36:21.080 --> 02:36:26.320]  You can even put, you know, Norris, you know, Norris directs film exposing plan to confiscate
[02:36:26.320 --> 02:36:27.320]  guns.
[02:36:27.320 --> 02:36:30.680]  I know your dad's going to help out with World Bank daily and so much more again to
[02:36:30.680 --> 02:36:33.840]  push a whole new genre, just like your dad did from the grassroots.
[02:36:33.840 --> 02:36:38.160]  I mean, explain that your dad with his films, grassroots to dominate Hollywood for over
[02:36:38.160 --> 02:36:40.840]  a decade, unprecedented what your dad did.
[02:36:40.840 --> 02:36:42.440]  You guys are getting ready to do it again with this.
[02:36:42.440 --> 02:36:43.440]  Yeah.
[02:36:43.440 --> 02:36:47.680]  No, we're going to do the same thing he did back in the late 70s, early 80s.
[02:36:47.680 --> 02:36:48.680]  He'd make a movie.
[02:36:48.680 --> 02:36:53.440]  He'd take it to a theater called Four Walling, rent the theater, and have people come in
[02:36:53.440 --> 02:36:54.440]  and see it.
[02:36:54.440 --> 02:36:58.040]  And that's pretty much, I think, the same thing we're going to do with this in Texas.
[02:36:58.040 --> 02:37:02.520]  I just think it's, I like it that I'm a Texan.
[02:37:02.520 --> 02:37:05.720]  I live in the greatest state we have in America.
[02:37:05.720 --> 02:37:08.040]  I believe Texas is the greatest state we have.
[02:37:08.040 --> 02:37:11.040]  It's the greatest country within America, I think.
[02:37:11.040 --> 02:37:15.240]  I've always heard that growing up and rolled my eyes, you don't listen to your parents
[02:37:15.240 --> 02:37:19.080]  and grandparents, but after I've been here and seen the difference in what Old Texas
[02:37:19.080 --> 02:37:21.120]  was, absolutely, it's great people.
[02:37:21.120 --> 02:37:22.120]  Yeah.
[02:37:22.120 --> 02:37:23.120]  And I'm from Los Angeles.
[02:37:23.120 --> 02:37:26.440]  I was born and raised in LA by the grace of God I got out of there.
[02:37:26.440 --> 02:37:27.440]  I'm a full-blood Texan.
[02:37:27.440 --> 02:37:29.320]  But you were partially raised by Steve McQueen, so.
[02:37:29.320 --> 02:37:30.320]  Ah, he did.
[02:37:30.320 --> 02:37:31.320]  He taught me how to ride a motor.
[02:37:31.320 --> 02:37:32.320]  A few things.
[02:37:32.320 --> 02:37:33.320]  Trump been from Texas.
[02:37:33.320 --> 02:37:34.320]  Yeah.
[02:37:34.320 --> 02:37:36.760]  But your daddy's from Oklahoma, which used to be part of Texas.
[02:37:36.760 --> 02:37:37.760]  Did it really?
[02:37:37.760 --> 02:37:38.760]  Oh, yeah.
[02:37:38.760 --> 02:37:39.760]  I thought we were part of Mexico.
[02:37:39.760 --> 02:37:40.760]  You were that too.
[02:37:40.760 --> 02:37:41.760]  Yeah.
[02:37:41.760 --> 02:37:42.760]  Have you seen the original Texas territory?
[02:37:42.760 --> 02:37:43.760]  Let's put it up on screen.
[02:37:43.760 --> 02:37:44.760]  Yeah, it was big.
[02:37:44.760 --> 02:37:46.480]  It went all the way up to Colorado.
[02:37:46.480 --> 02:37:48.560]  We don't learn that in school in California.
[02:37:48.560 --> 02:37:50.640]  We just learn about their earthquakes.
[02:37:50.640 --> 02:37:53.760]  Now, folks, show them original Texas map.
[02:37:53.760 --> 02:37:56.360]  Yeah, it was almost as big as Louisiana Purchase.
[02:37:56.360 --> 02:37:57.360]  Wow, that's crazy.
[02:37:57.360 --> 02:37:58.360]  Yeah, but keep going.
[02:37:58.360 --> 02:37:59.360]  Sorry.
[02:37:59.360 --> 02:38:00.360]  Yeah, but no.
[02:38:00.360 --> 02:38:01.360]  And that's what's really exciting.
[02:38:01.360 --> 02:38:02.360]  Oh, look at that.
[02:38:02.360 --> 02:38:03.360]  Part of Oklahoma.
[02:38:03.360 --> 02:38:04.360]  Yeah, sure is.
[02:38:04.360 --> 02:38:05.360]  Wow.
[02:38:05.360 --> 02:38:06.360]  Learn something every day.
[02:38:06.360 --> 02:38:07.360]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:38:07.360 --> 02:38:13.120]  But that's what's really exciting is, we've got a starting point.
[02:38:13.120 --> 02:38:17.560]  We appreciate you guys so much at Infowars, just how you've supported us, how you were
[02:38:17.560 --> 02:38:18.560]  there.
[02:38:18.560 --> 02:38:19.560]  David Knight's in the trailer.
[02:38:19.560 --> 02:38:20.560]  David Knight's in the trailer.
[02:38:20.560 --> 02:38:22.800]  David Knight did an amazing job in the opening.
[02:38:22.800 --> 02:38:27.440]  It's a little opening we've got to just kind of give an overview of where we are in the
[02:38:27.440 --> 02:38:28.640]  world today.
[02:38:28.640 --> 02:38:32.200]  And that's where our story picks up with you and Gary going head to head.
[02:38:32.200 --> 02:38:35.160]  I wonder if we'll see David Knight in future films.
[02:38:35.160 --> 02:38:36.160]  Very possible.
[02:38:36.160 --> 02:38:39.200]  Check Norris, sidekick, check Norris going through.
[02:38:39.200 --> 02:38:47.400]  But our goal ultimately is have this successful enough that the networks, that the TV networks
[02:38:47.400 --> 02:38:52.160]  can't deny us doing a television series called the American Diaries.
[02:38:52.160 --> 02:38:56.680]  Oh, dropping more bombshells on folks.
[02:38:56.680 --> 02:39:01.520]  But if people watch it, they have to show it.
[02:39:01.520 --> 02:39:02.520]  They have to show it.
[02:39:02.520 --> 02:39:05.440]  And you've done that a lot with TV shows over and over again.
[02:39:05.440 --> 02:39:06.440]  Absolutely.
[02:39:06.440 --> 02:39:07.440]  It's not just Walker, Texas Ranger.
[02:39:07.440 --> 02:39:09.440]  You yourself have rolled out a bunch of big TV shows.
[02:39:09.440 --> 02:39:14.080]  Yeah, I've worked on, you know, my brother was the stunt coordinator, second year director
[02:39:14.080 --> 02:39:15.760]  on Chase Prison Break.
[02:39:15.760 --> 02:39:20.960]  So I was able to go work on these shows, work on great films, rush hour films.
[02:39:20.960 --> 02:39:23.200]  So I've done a lot of stuff.
[02:39:23.200 --> 02:39:27.000]  The thing is, once I did American, that's it.
[02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:30.920]  I am now that guy doing those movies and I'm all in.
[02:39:30.920 --> 02:39:31.920]  I'm all in.
[02:39:31.920 --> 02:39:37.920]  I sold my soul to God, I will tell a story about this, just so folks get another example
[02:39:37.920 --> 02:39:38.920]  of the censorship.
[02:39:38.920 --> 02:39:39.920]  And I can care less.
[02:39:39.920 --> 02:39:40.920]  I love it.
[02:39:40.920 --> 02:39:46.600]  I knew back when I was on the set of scanner darkly consulting for it, but also in it with
[02:39:46.600 --> 02:39:50.240]  the great guy, Rick Linklater, who's a true, you know, liberal slash libertarian classical
[02:39:50.240 --> 02:39:55.520]  liberal, not the modern fascist type, but he runs the Austin, Texas film societies and
[02:39:55.520 --> 02:39:56.520]  stuff like that.
[02:39:56.520 --> 02:39:59.680]  And Robert Rodriguez was out there at the old airport where they have a whole shooting
[02:39:59.680 --> 02:40:00.680]  facility.
[02:40:00.680 --> 02:40:03.080]  I was first when they opened that at the old airport.
[02:40:03.080 --> 02:40:08.880]  And some of my films have been given by one of the stunt directors to Rodriguez's wife
[02:40:08.880 --> 02:40:09.880]  at the time.
[02:40:09.880 --> 02:40:13.200]  And she liked the films, but she, you know, I basically was told, well, but Rodriguez
[02:40:13.200 --> 02:40:15.680]  doesn't like you, blah, blah, blah and all the stuff because he wants a lot of recon
[02:40:15.680 --> 02:40:17.120]  keystone and all the rest of it.
[02:40:17.120 --> 02:40:21.720]  So he's kind of, in my view, in my opinion, like a white racist, he's a Hispanic racist.
[02:40:21.720 --> 02:40:23.760]  And he's shown that with some of the stuff he's done.
[02:40:23.760 --> 02:40:27.320]  But, you know, regardless, I'm against all folks being based on race stuff.
[02:40:27.320 --> 02:40:30.480]  And he's a very talented director, so I'm not attacking him.
[02:40:30.480 --> 02:40:35.000]  And I was given the script of machete and I just said, here's this script, it's incredibly
[02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:36.000]  race baiting.
[02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:37.000]  My gosh.
[02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:39.840]  And I knew it was being partially funded through the Democrats and others that later
[02:40:39.840 --> 02:40:44.040]  confirmed from inside sources that he's met with Obama with his channel, TV channel.
[02:40:44.040 --> 02:40:47.800]  He's launched, it's meant for this whole, you know, a clash of civilizations garbage,
[02:40:47.800 --> 02:40:50.080]  George Soros funding Black Lives Matter.
[02:40:50.080 --> 02:40:53.760]  So I'm for reforming the police problems, but I'm not for just overthrowing the government
[02:40:53.760 --> 02:40:57.760]  and, you know, having some communist takeover, which your film kind of covers, well, doesn't
[02:40:57.760 --> 02:41:00.240]  kind of cover what it does.
[02:41:00.240 --> 02:41:03.480]  And then Rodriguez comes out in the Austin, American statesmen and in variety and says
[02:41:03.480 --> 02:41:05.240]  Alex Jones is a liar.
[02:41:05.240 --> 02:41:06.240]  That is not the script.
[02:41:06.240 --> 02:41:07.240]  Well, I knew it was.
[02:41:07.240 --> 02:41:09.560]  It was directly from high level folks inside.
[02:41:09.560 --> 02:41:12.440]  Then the film came out and it was word for word.
[02:41:12.440 --> 02:41:18.520]  It was the script and Perry already wanted to cut some of the film incentives in Texas
[02:41:18.520 --> 02:41:20.680]  because they weren't, they were being selectively given.
[02:41:20.680 --> 02:41:22.800]  They wouldn't give them to conservative groups, libertarian groups.
[02:41:22.800 --> 02:41:25.400]  They wouldn't give them to a group that was making a film about Waco.
[02:41:25.400 --> 02:41:28.560]  That was even a liberal group that was against it.
[02:41:28.560 --> 02:41:32.920]  And so I said, it's wrong to not give the film incentives to everybody.
[02:41:32.920 --> 02:41:38.400]  You're making a film, whether it goes to DVD, whatever it says in the law, you get the tax
[02:41:38.400 --> 02:41:39.400]  incentive.
[02:41:39.400 --> 02:41:40.560]  I want no taxes on film.
[02:41:40.560 --> 02:41:42.320]  I want to be the new Hollywood.
[02:41:42.320 --> 02:41:43.320]  That's what I said.
[02:41:43.320 --> 02:41:45.080]  They spun that whole thing.
[02:41:45.080 --> 02:41:48.520]  Perry then basically used it to blame me and I'm not attacking Perry, but it happened
[02:41:48.520 --> 02:41:51.960]  that that's why they removed film incentives in Texas.
[02:41:51.960 --> 02:41:57.560]  And then Rodriguez with the entire business associations in Austin, as if it hurt me,
[02:41:57.560 --> 02:42:00.240]  we can't get somebody from Austin to change a light bulb in here.
[02:42:00.240 --> 02:42:01.240]  Well, that was better.
[02:42:01.240 --> 02:42:02.560]  We were going to have locals build our set.
[02:42:02.560 --> 02:42:05.560]  We just hired the folks that built the Fox News studios out of New York.
[02:42:05.560 --> 02:42:07.280]  Oh, you heard us so bad.
[02:42:07.280 --> 02:42:08.880]  We just hired folks from outside.
[02:42:08.880 --> 02:42:09.880]  I mean, big deal, great.
[02:42:09.880 --> 02:42:11.400]  But then we hired folks out of Dallas.
[02:42:11.400 --> 02:42:15.680]  But I've had people as far away as Dallas working here and they go, I just got a call
[02:42:15.680 --> 02:42:16.680]  from Rodriguez.
[02:42:16.680 --> 02:42:18.160]  I'll never work again if I work with you.
[02:42:18.160 --> 02:42:19.640]  And that's how Hollywood works.
[02:42:19.640 --> 02:42:20.640]  Explain that to people.
[02:42:20.640 --> 02:42:24.440]  Yeah, no, that's exactly how it is.
[02:42:24.440 --> 02:42:26.920]  People do get blackballed out of Hollywood.
[02:42:26.920 --> 02:42:30.040]  But I mean, down to the point where I can't even get crew in here.
[02:42:30.040 --> 02:42:31.040]  Yeah, no.
[02:42:31.040 --> 02:42:37.160]  Yeah, I get it there and you know what they they've got their hands inside the the unions
[02:42:37.160 --> 02:42:38.160]  and everything.
[02:42:38.160 --> 02:42:40.160]  Well, show us how they're thugs trying to run what we do.
[02:42:40.160 --> 02:42:41.160]  I'm not in the Hollywood.
[02:42:41.160 --> 02:42:42.840]  I'm going to be got a media operation.
[02:42:42.840 --> 02:42:43.840]  Yeah.
[02:42:43.840 --> 02:42:44.840]  And that's just like us.
[02:42:44.840 --> 02:42:45.840]  That's just like us.
[02:42:45.840 --> 02:42:46.840]  We make movies.
[02:42:46.840 --> 02:42:47.840]  We make movies.
[02:42:47.840 --> 02:42:50.600]  Yeah, yeah, it's tough.
[02:42:50.600 --> 02:42:54.600]  And I don't know what's going on down in Austin with Rodriguez, but I'm not trying to get
[02:42:54.600 --> 02:42:55.600]  you into that.
[02:42:55.600 --> 02:42:59.640]  I'm telling you inside baseball that I've experienced, talk about the type of stuff Hollywood does,
[02:42:59.640 --> 02:43:04.040]  the spiritual darkness you've talked about, why you say it's a satanic conspiracy.
[02:43:04.040 --> 02:43:07.880]  Because I agree at the end of the day, these people do stuff in power that isn't even good
[02:43:07.880 --> 02:43:10.440]  for them and their families or their bottom line.
[02:43:10.440 --> 02:43:11.600]  But they have a mission.
[02:43:11.600 --> 02:43:13.960]  They're bound together by that mystery of evil.
[02:43:13.960 --> 02:43:14.960]  Yeah.
[02:43:14.960 --> 02:43:15.960]  Yeah.
[02:43:15.960 --> 02:43:20.920]  I think the world, the whole world and the elites are demonic.
[02:43:20.920 --> 02:43:21.920]  I really do.
[02:43:21.920 --> 02:43:28.000]  I believe they have sold their soul to the devil for power, for money, and they want
[02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:29.000]  chaos.
[02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:30.920]  They need chaos to take over.
[02:43:30.920 --> 02:43:37.040]  It says in the movie, all America needs is a little chaos for us to take over.
[02:43:37.040 --> 02:43:42.880]  And it shows the U.N. and globalist, he's a Soros character, admittedly, creating the
[02:43:42.880 --> 02:43:43.880]  destabilization.
[02:43:43.880 --> 02:43:45.280]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:43:45.280 --> 02:43:46.680]  And it's happening.
[02:43:46.680 --> 02:43:48.560]  It's all happening right in front of us right now.
[02:43:48.560 --> 02:43:50.640]  All you got to do is turn on the TV.
[02:43:50.640 --> 02:43:51.640]  And I'm done.
[02:43:51.640 --> 02:43:54.320]  I'm turning on the TV because all they're telling me is lies.
[02:43:54.320 --> 02:43:56.120]  So this is where I'm getting my information.
[02:43:56.120 --> 02:43:59.720]  I'm getting my information from you, from Brite, from Drudge.
[02:43:59.720 --> 02:44:04.320]  That's where we need to, people really need to go out and start studying.
[02:44:04.320 --> 02:44:08.920]  Well, I got to say, Breitbart was always really good, but they just do break a lot of hardcore
[02:44:08.920 --> 02:44:09.920]  news.
[02:44:09.920 --> 02:44:10.920]  So does Daily Caller.
[02:44:10.920 --> 02:44:11.920]  Yeah.
[02:44:11.920 --> 02:44:14.320]  I mean, they're really exposing, so is Info Wars.
[02:44:14.320 --> 02:44:16.320]  But people say, man, why don't you promote your competition?
[02:44:16.320 --> 02:44:17.320]  It's not competition.
[02:44:17.320 --> 02:44:18.320]  No.
[02:44:18.320 --> 02:44:20.920]  I mean, we're going to lose everything if we don't turn this around, folks.
[02:44:20.920 --> 02:44:21.920]  No.
[02:44:21.920 --> 02:44:22.920]  You're 100% right.
[02:44:22.920 --> 02:44:26.360]  And we're losing every, we're losing right now, but we will win.
[02:44:26.360 --> 02:44:27.360]  We are going to win this.
[02:44:27.360 --> 02:44:28.360]  Well, not Daily's excellent.
[02:44:28.360 --> 02:44:29.360]  Yeah.
[02:44:29.360 --> 02:44:30.360]  Well, not Daily.
[02:44:30.360 --> 02:44:31.360]  Yeah.
[02:44:31.360 --> 02:44:32.360]  But we're going to win.
[02:44:32.360 --> 02:44:33.360]  It's going to end.
[02:44:33.360 --> 02:44:37.720]  Man, what people got to understand, this is not, this isn't a joke.
[02:44:37.720 --> 02:44:38.720]  This is going to be horrible.
[02:44:38.720 --> 02:44:39.720]  When all this stuff.
[02:44:39.720 --> 02:44:43.480]  The Supreme Court Justice, I can't name him, came to Drudge and said, they're going to
[02:44:43.480 --> 02:44:45.360]  start trying to shut the media down next year.
[02:44:45.360 --> 02:44:46.360]  Yeah.
[02:44:46.360 --> 02:44:47.880]  And it's going to be horrible.
[02:44:47.880 --> 02:44:52.720]  And once they start trying to really take away our guns, that's when it, it's really
[02:44:52.720 --> 02:44:53.720]  going to fall apart.
[02:44:53.720 --> 02:44:55.560]  I'm not giving up mine.
[02:44:55.560 --> 02:44:59.840]  And they know that that will trigger the civil war, which is the ultimate false flag.
[02:44:59.840 --> 02:45:03.720]  Because if they've war-gamed it and know it'll start a war, it's unconstitutional, it'll
[02:45:03.720 --> 02:45:07.560]  cause higher crime, it's evil, and they go ahead and do it just like they destabilize
[02:45:07.560 --> 02:45:11.840]  Syria or Ukraine is, are the elites really going to let George Soros and Hillary Clinton
[02:45:11.840 --> 02:45:14.520]  and others and Obama really try to run that here?
[02:45:14.520 --> 02:45:17.200]  I mean, you people, and look, we have General Flynn.
[02:45:17.200 --> 02:45:20.800]  These are the top generals coming out saying, our government runs Al-Qaeda and ISIS.
[02:45:20.800 --> 02:45:21.800]  It's wrong.
[02:45:21.800 --> 02:45:22.800]  It was willful.
[02:45:22.800 --> 02:45:23.800]  It's evil.
[02:45:23.800 --> 02:45:24.920]  It needs to be investigated.
[02:45:24.920 --> 02:45:29.640]  That is almost a Valkyrie level World War II, the German military going after Hitler.
[02:45:29.640 --> 02:45:32.000]  That's one inch away from that next move.
[02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:33.000]  Yeah.
[02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:36.720]  Oh, imagine a Chuck Norris movie with a hundred million dollar budget with him as a Colonel
[02:45:36.720 --> 02:45:43.720]  leading a command group, kicking a UN takeover army basically out of DC or something.
[02:45:43.720 --> 02:45:44.720]  That would be the movie.
[02:45:44.720 --> 02:45:45.720]  Oh, yeah.
[02:45:45.720 --> 02:45:47.480]  Yeah, that would be cool.
[02:45:47.480 --> 02:45:48.480]  That would actually.
[02:45:48.480 --> 02:45:49.480]  Yeah.
[02:45:49.480 --> 02:45:50.960]  But it really goes back.
[02:45:50.960 --> 02:45:53.640]  We are all in a fight and we're on our side.
[02:45:53.640 --> 02:45:58.160]  We're the good guys here and your listeners and your viewers are the good guys.
[02:45:58.160 --> 02:45:59.160]  I agree.
[02:45:59.160 --> 02:46:00.160]  It's another fight.
[02:46:00.160 --> 02:46:03.920]  Who was the famous gray hair guy that played in Westerns and other combat movies?
[02:46:03.920 --> 02:46:10.280]  The gray hair guy that's like the commander in Delta Force and your dad's, pull up IMDb
[02:46:10.280 --> 02:46:13.400]  Delta Force, Delta Force one Chuck Norris.
[02:46:13.400 --> 02:46:14.960]  The point is you're decked up.
[02:46:14.960 --> 02:46:19.360]  Marvin Lee Marvin, your dad could now even look as old as Lee Marvin did, but your dad
[02:46:19.360 --> 02:46:23.640]  has got to now play the Lee Marvin character in movies like this, like bring back snake
[02:46:23.640 --> 02:46:24.640]  plus can.
[02:46:24.640 --> 02:46:25.640]  Yeah, there it is.
[02:46:25.640 --> 02:46:26.640]  Yeah, that's it.
[02:46:26.640 --> 02:46:29.040]  Chuck Norris, Lee Marvin, Delta Force.
[02:46:29.040 --> 02:46:30.040]  Yeah.
[02:46:30.040 --> 02:46:34.640]  We I was with my dad at Thanksgiving and I got to tell you, he looks great.
[02:46:34.640 --> 02:46:39.760]  I mean, he's look at that commie voting 5.5 deserves 10 stars.
[02:46:39.760 --> 02:46:40.760]  That's Hollywood.
[02:46:40.760 --> 02:46:42.160]  I think I'm going to buy Delta Force.
[02:46:42.160 --> 02:46:43.160]  That's good.
[02:46:43.160 --> 02:46:44.160]  Man, that's a good movie.
[02:46:44.160 --> 02:46:45.160]  Yeah.
[02:46:45.160 --> 02:46:50.560]  After after my dad did kind of a road warrior style films, yeah, after my dad did the first
[02:46:50.560 --> 02:46:55.600]  two Delta forces, the film company can and wanted to do there's a little more life in
[02:46:55.600 --> 02:46:56.600]  this.
[02:46:56.600 --> 02:46:57.600]  Let's go do it.
[02:46:57.600 --> 02:46:58.600]  So I got a phone call.
[02:46:58.600 --> 02:47:01.760]  Well, we want to make these Delta Force movies, but we don't want to spend that kind of money.
[02:47:01.760 --> 02:47:04.520]  So in comes Mike Norris to do Delta Force three and four.
[02:47:04.520 --> 02:47:05.520]  Right.
[02:47:05.520 --> 02:47:06.520]  It was great.
[02:47:06.520 --> 02:47:07.520]  I had a great time.
[02:47:07.520 --> 02:47:08.520]  Let's pull that up.
[02:47:08.520 --> 02:47:09.520]  Let's pull up Mike Norris, Delta Force three and four.
[02:47:09.520 --> 02:47:10.520]  Let's see you then.
[02:47:10.520 --> 02:47:14.560]  So later on, only were you, you know, good buddies and your dad, of course, with Steve
[02:47:14.560 --> 02:47:18.080]  McQueen, who I guess introduced your dad into movies and the rest was history.
[02:47:18.080 --> 02:47:19.440]  But your dad was the real deal.
[02:47:19.440 --> 02:47:24.280]  I mean, I remember talking to Joe Rogan, who's an accomplished UFC guy and wants some national
[02:47:24.280 --> 02:47:25.680]  stuff in Taekwondo as well.
[02:47:25.680 --> 02:47:26.680]  Yeah.
[02:47:26.680 --> 02:47:28.800]  I was like, well, who, you know, like, who's your idol?
[02:47:28.800 --> 02:47:32.400]  And he goes, well, I like Chuck Norris and this is like met him like 16, 17 years ago
[02:47:32.400 --> 02:47:33.400]  here in Austin.
[02:47:33.400 --> 02:47:34.400]  We've been good friends since then.
[02:47:34.400 --> 02:47:35.400]  And I said, why?
[02:47:35.400 --> 02:47:36.640]  And he goes, well, he's like the American deal.
[02:47:36.640 --> 02:47:39.440]  He goes, he won all those championships for real against guys a lot bigger.
[02:47:39.440 --> 02:47:40.440]  That was all real.
[02:47:40.440 --> 02:47:42.280]  And he could continue to win over and over again.
[02:47:42.280 --> 02:47:45.600]  And he goes, man, you get hurt doing that just a couple of times because, you know, that
[02:47:45.600 --> 02:47:46.600]  was contact sport.
[02:47:46.600 --> 02:47:48.000]  Obviously, you know, all about it.
[02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:52.560]  And the fact that then he could go on and start his own Hollywood thing from the grassroots.
[02:47:52.560 --> 02:47:55.760]  I mean, your dad was a Mavericks Maverick when the stuff he's done and he's still a
[02:47:55.760 --> 02:47:58.200]  Mavericks Maverick with what he's going to do in the future.
[02:47:58.200 --> 02:47:59.200]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:47:59.200 --> 02:48:09.680]  I, you know, it's really a blessing to really have a father that first off, he loved us.
[02:48:09.680 --> 02:48:11.520]  Well, Joe, I forgot, Joe just interrupts.
[02:48:11.520 --> 02:48:12.520]  I'm so horrible.
[02:48:12.520 --> 02:48:13.520]  Yeah, I forgot.
[02:48:13.520 --> 02:48:17.200]  Joe said he thought your dad would have been a UFC champion if he'd have been, you know,
[02:48:17.200 --> 02:48:18.960]  at that age now when that was going on.
[02:48:18.960 --> 02:48:19.960]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:48:19.960 --> 02:48:21.600]  I could have been.
[02:48:21.600 --> 02:48:24.520]  My dad was smarter than any other fighter out there.
[02:48:24.520 --> 02:48:25.920]  He was not the most physical.
[02:48:25.920 --> 02:48:29.680]  He was not the fastest, meanest anything, but he was the smartest.
[02:48:29.680 --> 02:48:33.600]  And if he ever did get beat, it only happened once because he would learn his lesson, come
[02:48:33.600 --> 02:48:34.960]  back and beat that opponent.
[02:48:34.960 --> 02:48:35.960]  Sure.
[02:48:35.960 --> 02:48:36.960]  But you said your dad loved you uninterrupted.
[02:48:36.960 --> 02:48:37.960]  Yeah.
[02:48:37.960 --> 02:48:38.960]  No, you know what?
[02:48:38.960 --> 02:48:44.640]  My dad, in our, you know, during high school, he wouldn't make movies during football season.
[02:48:44.640 --> 02:48:48.800]  He'd come to every football game, every Friday night light.
[02:48:48.800 --> 02:48:53.520]  So he scheduled his life around his kids.
[02:48:53.520 --> 02:48:58.560]  And I hope he, I hope he still sees it like that because he's got two younger kids now
[02:48:58.560 --> 02:49:03.240]  with Gina and they're 14, 15 years old.
[02:49:03.240 --> 02:49:08.480]  And it's important that my dad knows that this isn't his second chance.
[02:49:08.480 --> 02:49:12.680]  He did great the first time and he's going to do great again with his new kids.
[02:49:12.680 --> 02:49:19.040]  But it was so special to be able to, you know, see him kind of, his fame, get a little higher
[02:49:19.040 --> 02:49:21.400]  and then he'd still show up at all the football games.
[02:49:21.400 --> 02:49:24.960]  I'd run up and give him a kiss after every game and him and my mother.
[02:49:24.960 --> 02:49:27.480]  So it was all very normal.
[02:49:27.480 --> 02:49:28.480]  It was all very normal.
[02:49:28.480 --> 02:49:30.400]  Chuck Norris is pure America.
[02:49:30.400 --> 02:49:31.400]  Absolutely.
[02:49:31.400 --> 02:49:32.400]  Absolutely.
[02:49:32.400 --> 02:49:36.680]  He 100% Well, it's amazing.
[02:49:36.680 --> 02:49:40.400]  The film is American, you guys are 100% Americana.
[02:49:40.400 --> 02:49:46.000]  I just want to congratulate you and Gary Haven and everybody else because this is better
[02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:47.000]  than I thought it'd be.
[02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:48.000]  Yeah.
[02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:49.000]  I mean, it really is good.
[02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:50.920]  And I got a chance to see the film last week.
[02:49:50.920 --> 02:49:55.960]  I hope we can come back down before the film opens in March to bring Gary down here.
[02:49:55.960 --> 02:50:03.840]  Like I said, Gary, the man of mystery is off doing something mysterious, but he, he is
[02:50:03.840 --> 02:50:10.200]  very passionate, very well read on everything going on and where I'm always trying to play
[02:50:10.200 --> 02:50:11.880]  catch up with him.
[02:50:11.880 --> 02:50:12.880]  So I'm excited.
[02:50:12.880 --> 02:50:17.680]  I just really encourage everybody to go to the American Facebook page, American, the
[02:50:17.680 --> 02:50:18.680]  film, website.
[02:50:18.680 --> 02:50:20.040]  You know what's weird?
[02:50:20.040 --> 02:50:21.040]  You just launched today.
[02:50:21.040 --> 02:50:25.000]  It was like 100, 500, 800, just went back down to 400, never seen Facebook do that.
[02:50:25.000 --> 02:50:26.480]  The likes just went down on it.
[02:50:26.480 --> 02:50:28.040]  I wonder if they're jacking with that.
[02:50:28.040 --> 02:50:32.640]  I mean, they, I mean, it certainly censors sometimes so it's going up and down.
[02:50:32.640 --> 02:50:34.520]  We need this to have hundreds of thousands by next week.
[02:50:34.520 --> 02:50:39.240]  I know the trailer will exclusively at info wars.com and prison planet.com.
[02:50:39.240 --> 02:50:42.760]  See the trailer and there's another trailer coming out that yours truly pumpkin head is

[02:50:44.760 --> 02:50:45.760]  Mike, come back.
[02:50:45.760 --> 02:50:46.760]  I got a few other questions for you.
[02:50:46.760 --> 02:50:51.880]  And then we're going to hand the baton to David Knight, who is actually in the trailer
[02:50:51.880 --> 02:50:55.240]  promoting the film is kind of like the narrator was like a Blade Runner.
[02:50:55.240 --> 02:50:59.920]  They've got the old cop talking about, well, it was happening at that time.
[02:50:59.920 --> 02:51:05.600]  Oh, oh, oh, Katie is ready for the holiday season.

[02:52:29.360 --> 02:52:32.560]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[02:52:32.560 --> 02:52:35.720]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St. Croix River.
[02:52:35.720 --> 02:52:38.040]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[02:52:38.040 --> 02:52:41.040]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[02:52:41.040 --> 02:52:42.040]  His excuse?
[02:52:42.040 --> 02:52:43.200]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[02:52:43.200 --> 02:52:47.080]  He wasn't a rich man by any means at less than $107 per month.
[02:52:47.080 --> 02:52:50.800]  Liberty on call.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.
[02:52:50.800 --> 02:52:51.800]  Don't wait.

[02:54:25.320 --> 02:54:27.600]  I said, hey, we're going to come back in this segment, do five more minutes for the next
[02:54:27.600 --> 02:54:32.760]  hour, and then no man's land and then hand it over to David Knight and said, I'm going

[02:54:41.720 --> 02:54:42.720]  This is not a setup.
[02:54:42.720 --> 02:54:43.720]  No.
[02:54:43.720 --> 02:54:46.480]  Please, because I know I gave you a bunch of this a year ago, please repeat for the audience
[02:54:46.480 --> 02:54:49.880]  out there what SuperMail and other products did for you and Mike Norris.
[02:54:49.880 --> 02:54:55.800]  Well, you know what, I have lost 50 pounds using these supplements from Alex and Info
[02:54:55.800 --> 02:54:56.800]  New York.
[02:54:56.800 --> 02:54:57.800]  But you were never fat.
[02:54:57.800 --> 02:54:58.800]  I don't know what happened to you.
[02:54:58.800 --> 02:55:00.680]  Well, I was 232 when we did the film.
[02:55:00.680 --> 02:55:02.880]  I was 232 pounds.
[02:55:02.880 --> 02:55:04.360]  I was a horrible mess.
[02:55:04.360 --> 02:55:07.200]  Well, you're in fighting weight right now, but really, are you really the product?
[02:55:07.200 --> 02:55:08.200]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:55:08.200 --> 02:55:10.200]  You gave me a whole box of these.
[02:55:10.200 --> 02:55:12.480]  Hey, male vitality.
[02:55:12.480 --> 02:55:13.640]  Where's my camera?
[02:55:13.640 --> 02:55:14.640]  Get it.
[02:55:14.640 --> 02:55:15.640]  Brain.
[02:55:15.640 --> 02:55:16.640]  The brain.
[02:55:16.640 --> 02:55:17.640]  Right there.
[02:55:17.640 --> 02:55:18.640]  I'm telling you.
[02:55:18.640 --> 02:55:19.640]  Everybody.
[02:55:19.640 --> 02:55:20.640]  It's amazing.
[02:55:20.640 --> 02:55:21.640]  I use it.
[02:55:21.640 --> 02:55:22.640]  I've lost 50 pounds.
[02:55:22.640 --> 02:55:23.640]  I feel great.
[02:55:23.640 --> 02:55:25.480]  I feel better than I've ever felt in my life.
[02:55:25.480 --> 02:55:27.240]  This is not a joke.
[02:55:27.240 --> 02:55:28.680]  Please support this.
[02:55:28.680 --> 02:55:29.680]  It's awesome.
[02:55:29.680 --> 02:55:30.680]  Well, thank you.
[02:55:30.680 --> 02:55:32.600]  I mean, I went to the top chemist.
[02:55:32.600 --> 02:55:38.280]  We have two of the biggest non-GMO laboratories in the country that are like, you know, they
[02:55:38.280 --> 02:55:40.000]  make most of stuff from old food, you name it.
[02:55:40.000 --> 02:55:44.000]  And I said, what would your scientists want to be just over the top if people really wanted
[02:55:44.000 --> 02:55:46.640]  to have, you know, half the cost of the bottle be the product?
[02:55:46.640 --> 02:55:47.640]  We would do this.
[02:55:47.640 --> 02:55:48.640]  We would do that.
[02:55:48.640 --> 02:55:49.640]  We would do that.
[02:55:49.640 --> 02:55:51.000]  And Group makes most of my products as well.
[02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:54.240]  That's what kind of, you know, sets up the whole vetting process.
[02:55:54.240 --> 02:55:58.080]  And you know, we'll have a product that's 40 bucks and $20 of it's the product.
[02:55:58.080 --> 02:55:59.280]  Let's fill a big markup.
[02:55:59.280 --> 02:56:01.560]  The average markup is supplement seven times.
[02:56:01.560 --> 02:56:04.120]  They will not put the quality in it.
[02:56:04.120 --> 02:56:08.080]  And that's why this stuff, I mean, I want stuff that will knock your socks off.
[02:56:08.080 --> 02:56:11.640]  And I'm telling you, infowarslife.com, supermale isn't a game, though.
[02:56:11.640 --> 02:56:14.760]  I know people that like, think, oh, this is great, and then drink a quarter bottle and
[02:56:14.760 --> 02:56:16.520]  then do not do it, folks.
[02:56:16.520 --> 02:56:18.520]  I mean, believe me, it's not a game.
[02:56:18.520 --> 02:56:24.040]  infowarslife.com, free shipping in December 18th, 33% off the Essentials Pack, a bunch
[02:56:24.040 --> 02:56:27.360]  of other specials as well, infowarslife.com.
[02:56:27.360 --> 02:56:29.360]  What did you notice when you started taking the supermale?
[02:56:29.360 --> 02:56:33.840]  Well, it's a family show, I guess.
[02:56:33.840 --> 02:56:35.600]  Feeling, I feel really good.
[02:56:35.600 --> 02:56:37.600]  My wife's very happy.
[02:56:37.600 --> 02:56:40.480]  Sorry, honey.
[02:56:40.480 --> 02:56:44.960]  I got a high-powered lawyer who one of his best friends is like a top herbologist and
[02:56:44.960 --> 02:56:46.600]  he just wanted to see if I was full of baloney.
[02:56:46.600 --> 02:56:47.600]  I've known him for years.
[02:56:47.600 --> 02:56:48.600]  I've known him to anyone.
[02:56:48.600 --> 02:56:49.600]  Man, this is really great stuff.
[02:56:49.600 --> 02:56:50.600]  Oh, Dr. Grip's involved.
[02:56:50.600 --> 02:56:51.600]  Well, that's like the best guy.
[02:56:51.600 --> 02:56:57.160]  Well, you know, everybody's now getting testosterone shots, having to take this or that, right
[02:56:57.160 --> 02:56:58.160]  here.
[02:56:58.160 --> 02:56:59.160]  One stop.
[02:56:59.160 --> 02:57:02.760]  It's the real deal, and it's from Mother Nature, the good old lord above.
[02:57:02.760 --> 02:57:04.800]  All right, we're going to break here.
[02:57:04.800 --> 02:57:09.120]  You've been talking about Trump, and so if you want to repeat any of that on air, I mean,
[02:57:09.120 --> 02:57:10.120]  what do you think about Trump?
[02:57:10.120 --> 02:57:12.120]  What's papa think about it?
[02:57:12.120 --> 02:57:13.120]  Okay.
[02:57:13.120 --> 02:57:17.360]  You know, my dad loves Trump.
[02:57:17.360 --> 02:57:19.760]  There may be some issues with facial expressions.
[02:57:19.760 --> 02:57:21.760]  I don't know.
[02:57:21.760 --> 02:57:29.760]  Look, there's nothing wrong with the American people wanting our leader to make us feel better,
[02:57:29.760 --> 02:57:31.240]  make us feel safe.
[02:57:31.240 --> 02:57:32.240]  I'm safe.
[02:57:32.240 --> 02:57:33.760]  You're safe.
[02:57:33.760 --> 02:57:39.680]  Your listeners are, I'm sure, probably pretty safe because they're armed, they're ready.
[02:57:39.680 --> 02:57:45.200]  But the average Joe wants a leader that's going to make them feel secure living in this
[02:57:45.200 --> 02:57:46.440]  country.
[02:57:46.440 --> 02:57:47.720]  It's like Ronald Reagan.
[02:57:47.720 --> 02:57:50.000]  It's like Ronald Reagan in 1981.
[02:57:50.000 --> 02:57:52.960]  I remember it was the first time I ever got to vote for president.
[02:57:52.960 --> 02:57:55.080]  I was in high school, and I voted for Ronald Reagan.
[02:57:55.080 --> 02:57:56.080]  I remember this.
[02:57:56.080 --> 02:58:01.760]  Jimmy Carter, we had hostages in Iran, and Ronald Reagan says, the economy was in the
[02:58:01.760 --> 02:58:02.760]  toilet.
[02:58:02.760 --> 02:58:04.320]  Everything was horrible.
[02:58:04.320 --> 02:58:05.320]  Everything was horrible.
[02:58:05.320 --> 02:58:08.360]  And man, as soon as Reagan got in, our hostages were back.
[02:58:08.360 --> 02:58:10.160]  We still have hostages in Iran.
[02:58:10.160 --> 02:58:15.120]  Right now, we still have hostages over there, and during this whole dang Iranian thing,
[02:58:15.120 --> 02:58:16.560]  that was never addressed.
[02:58:16.560 --> 02:58:17.560]  I like Trump.
[02:58:17.560 --> 02:58:18.560]  I love Trump.
[02:58:18.560 --> 02:58:25.120]  Well, that's what we need is a national symbol or somebody to tell us that we can be great
[02:58:25.120 --> 02:58:29.600]  again and to get past the socialist idea that we're all pathetic, cloward and pivot.
[02:58:29.600 --> 02:58:31.280]  They don't want us to feel great again.
[02:58:31.280 --> 02:58:32.280]  Women feel great.
[02:58:32.280 --> 02:58:33.280]  Men feel great.
[02:58:33.280 --> 02:58:34.280]  Stay there.
[02:58:34.280 --> 02:58:38.440]  Another segment with Mike Norris, 70 Seconds Away, and the fourth hour, infowars.com,
[02:58:38.440 --> 02:58:41.360]  forward slash show, amerageddonthemovie.com.
[02:58:41.360 --> 02:58:45.880]  If you don't send that link out and watch that video, all I can say is you're helping
[02:58:45.880 --> 02:58:46.880]  the globalist.
[02:58:46.880 --> 02:58:48.760]  I mean, seriously, folks, we love you.
[02:58:48.760 --> 02:58:49.760]  We know you will.
[02:58:49.760 --> 02:58:53.360]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[02:58:53.360 --> 02:58:58.640]  Deep Cleanse by infowarslife.com, a scientifically formulated blend of nanocoloidal zeolites
[02:58:58.640 --> 02:59:02.760]  and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.

[02:59:06.840 --> 02:59:08.000]  all-in-one cleanser.

[02:59:14.480 --> 02:59:17.360]  and others, Deep Cleanse doesn't hold back.
[02:59:17.360 --> 02:59:21.840]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades-old
[02:59:21.840 --> 02:59:26.000]  scientific research to put together the Rolls Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[02:59:26.000 --> 02:59:30.200]  Look, there's a reason Deep Cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our
[02:59:30.200 --> 02:59:33.360]  proprietary SpyJurex herbal processing technique.
[02:59:33.360 --> 02:59:37.640]  We use only the highest quality organic herbs backed by serious research, and we still bring
[02:59:37.640 --> 02:59:39.520]  it to you at the best price out there.
[02:59:39.520 --> 02:59:44.680]  If you wish to find Deep Cleanse and experience the all-in-one cleansing, visit infowarslife.com.

[02:59:52.240 --> 03:00:09.040]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:09.040 --> 03:00:13.040]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:13.040 --> 03:00:23.040]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:23.040 --> 03:00:35.520]  Look at this new story from infowars.com.
[03:00:35.520 --> 03:00:39.160]  A transgender father who abandoned his seven children to start a new life as a six-year-old
[03:00:39.160 --> 03:00:44.080]  girl is being celebrated by some liberals as a shining example of diversity, shows the
[03:00:44.080 --> 03:00:48.680]  woman that poor Drano in her eyes and makes taxpayers pay for her life.
[03:00:48.680 --> 03:00:55.400]  What do you think is behind all of this, Mr. Norris?
[03:00:55.400 --> 03:00:58.000]  You know what?
[03:00:58.000 --> 03:00:59.000]  Could it be the food?
[03:00:59.000 --> 03:01:00.000]  I don't know.
[03:01:00.000 --> 03:01:01.560]  I really don't know.
[03:01:01.560 --> 03:01:08.960]  What is causing people-Alex, I really don't even have an answer.
[03:01:08.960 --> 03:01:15.280]  It looks like a 300-pound guy would run a diner in New Jersey.
[03:01:15.280 --> 03:01:17.280]  Like Alice, I guess.
[03:01:17.280 --> 03:01:19.480]  You know, we're in a sick world.
[03:01:19.480 --> 03:01:25.560]  It's a sick world we're living in, and you know, fortunately, there's a lot of people
[03:01:25.560 --> 03:01:32.400]  that know the truth and that are going to stand up against this, but our Congress and
[03:01:32.400 --> 03:01:35.920]  our Supreme Court, they're just going to let this go.
[03:01:35.920 --> 03:01:39.200]  You were talking, exactly, you were telling us we have to accept it and pay for it.
[03:01:39.200 --> 03:01:42.880]  You were talking about, on Trump, finish up on that and the time we have, and then also
[03:01:42.880 --> 03:01:45.360]  you want to talk about President's address on Sunday.
[03:01:45.360 --> 03:01:53.040]  Yeah, I just, you know, I'm safe, I've got my family protected, but as a country, it's
[03:01:53.040 --> 03:01:59.640]  nice that when we see our leader, our president, come up and make us feel we're bad ass.
[03:01:59.640 --> 03:02:01.800]  We are a bad ass country.
[03:02:01.800 --> 03:02:06.840]  The other night when Obama came on for the State of the Union or whatever he did for
[03:02:06.840 --> 03:02:09.920]  13 minutes was pathetic.
[03:02:09.920 --> 03:02:14.400]  Now, Donald Trump, I love him.
[03:02:14.400 --> 03:02:16.040]  I love that guy.
[03:02:16.040 --> 03:02:18.040]  And what we need is a good leader.
[03:02:18.040 --> 03:02:22.480]  We need somebody as a CEO of this company that's going to bring in some great people
[03:02:22.480 --> 03:02:24.680]  underneath him to run this country.
[03:02:24.680 --> 03:02:28.560]  Well, globalism is about screwing your country over and transferring the power to yourself
[03:02:28.560 --> 03:02:31.600]  and your buddies offshore, and Trump's exposing all that.
[03:02:31.600 --> 03:02:35.080]  No more tax exemption for mega offshore corporations.
[03:02:35.080 --> 03:02:39.040]  You know, you're not going to shut our power plants down so China can have cheap electricity
[03:02:39.040 --> 03:02:40.040]  and we can't.
[03:02:40.040 --> 03:02:43.960]  I mean, it's just all they got to do is take their boot off our neck and we're going to
[03:02:43.960 --> 03:02:44.960]  do great again.
[03:02:44.960 --> 03:02:46.960]  Yeah, make America great.
[03:02:46.960 --> 03:02:47.960]  That's it.
[03:02:47.960 --> 03:02:49.360]  Let's make America great.
[03:02:49.360 --> 03:02:51.120]  How the election's going to shake out?
[03:02:51.120 --> 03:02:52.120]  I have no idea.
[03:02:52.120 --> 03:02:53.120]  I have no idea.
[03:02:53.120 --> 03:02:55.720]  You said Gary Haven called you when Trump was on and said, hey, these are the questions
[03:02:55.720 --> 03:02:56.720]  I wish he was asking Trump.
[03:02:56.720 --> 03:02:59.320]  What were some of those questions the next time he's on, I'll get you.
[03:02:59.320 --> 03:03:03.400]  Yeah, Gary's going to have to give those to you.
[03:03:03.400 --> 03:03:07.200]  It's like in between you and Gary, there's so much knowledge that my head explodes.
[03:03:07.200 --> 03:03:09.400]  Oh, no, you know as much as I do.
[03:03:09.400 --> 03:03:11.920]  You know more than I do and I want it.
[03:03:11.920 --> 03:03:16.920]  It's just going back to, I feed off of Gary's passion.
[03:03:16.920 --> 03:03:20.760]  I feed off of his passion and that's kind of like Donald Trump.
[03:03:20.760 --> 03:03:26.280]  When we see a leader that's committed and wanting to make America great, you follow,
[03:03:26.280 --> 03:03:28.400]  you will follow this guy.
[03:03:28.400 --> 03:03:30.600]  That's how I felt about Trump.
[03:03:30.600 --> 03:03:37.040]  I know it's a little, you know, the more they pile on him and the more he stands up to him,
[03:03:37.040 --> 03:03:38.040]  I just love it.
[03:03:38.040 --> 03:03:39.040]  And he may not be perfect.
[03:03:39.040 --> 03:03:40.040]  He may screw us over.
[03:03:40.040 --> 03:03:41.040]  But here's the thing.
[03:03:41.040 --> 03:03:42.040]  We know Jeb Bush is bad.
[03:03:42.040 --> 03:03:43.040]  We know Bernie Sanders is bad.
[03:03:43.040 --> 03:03:44.040]  We know Hillary's bad.
[03:03:44.040 --> 03:03:45.040]  So it's not Ted Cruz.
[03:03:45.040 --> 03:03:46.040]  It was not Rand Paul.
[03:03:46.040 --> 03:03:47.040]  I want Trump.
[03:03:47.040 --> 03:03:48.640]  I'll take any one of those three.
[03:03:48.640 --> 03:03:52.120]  Yeah, I'd go Trump, Rand Paul.
[03:03:52.120 --> 03:03:53.120]  Yep.
[03:03:53.120 --> 03:03:54.760]  Period.
[03:03:54.760 --> 03:03:59.320]  My issue is I just wish Rand Paul would get tougher because I know Rand Paul behind the
[03:03:59.320 --> 03:04:03.120]  scenes is a listener or friend walking, but you know, his, his, his staff and then the
[03:04:03.120 --> 03:04:06.440]  way they do stuff is just two milk toast and I look, I'm not going to just sit here and
[03:04:06.440 --> 03:04:07.440]  blindly follow Rand Paul.
[03:04:07.440 --> 03:04:08.440]  I'm going to tell him on a thing.
[03:04:08.440 --> 03:04:09.440]  Yeah.
[03:04:09.440 --> 03:04:11.400]  And Gary just spent four days with them down in Haiti.
[03:04:11.400 --> 03:04:15.760]  Gary took Rand to Haiti in his plane, went and did some eye surgery.
[03:04:15.760 --> 03:04:19.560]  Gary's got a mission or an orphanage down in Haiti.
[03:04:19.560 --> 03:04:20.840]  So he flies supplies down there.
[03:04:20.840 --> 03:04:24.200]  He bought an airliner to fly up and to be clear, Gary knows him really well and says he's
[03:04:24.200 --> 03:04:25.200]  the real deal.
[03:04:25.200 --> 03:04:26.200]  It's a real deal.
[03:04:26.200 --> 03:04:27.200]  Yeah.
[03:04:27.200 --> 03:04:28.200]  I mean, Rand Paul is the real deal.
[03:04:28.200 --> 03:04:32.040]  He is a pro-America patriot who isn't a sellout and really loves this country, but Gary also
[03:04:32.040 --> 03:04:33.720]  had dinner with Ted Cruz.
[03:04:33.720 --> 03:04:36.360]  He's also had, uh, he's vetted all of them.
[03:04:36.360 --> 03:04:37.360]  They've all come to him.
[03:04:37.360 --> 03:04:40.920]  I need to get Gary in here in his own words and tell us what he said about.
[03:04:40.920 --> 03:04:41.920]  Yeah.
[03:04:41.920 --> 03:04:42.920]  He'll, he'll be back.
[03:04:42.920 --> 03:04:43.920]  Like I said, Gary's out.
[03:04:43.920 --> 03:04:44.920]  Taking care of business.
[03:04:44.920 --> 03:04:45.920]  Secret location.
[03:04:45.920 --> 03:04:46.920]  Yeah.
[03:04:46.920 --> 03:04:47.920]  Secret location.
[03:04:47.920 --> 03:04:48.920]  Just like this.
[03:04:48.920 --> 03:04:49.920]  And he's going to be ready to go come January.
[03:04:49.920 --> 03:04:53.480]  We're going to hit the road for this film in Marageddon and we're going to hit the road
[03:04:53.480 --> 03:04:57.640]  and go promote this great job of Marageddon coming out on Texas independence day in Texas
[03:04:57.640 --> 03:04:58.640]  only first.
[03:04:58.640 --> 03:04:59.640]  Please support us.
[03:04:59.640 --> 03:05:00.640]  David Knight.
[03:05:00.640 --> 03:05:01.640]  An alert.
[03:05:01.640 --> 03:05:07.200]  Obama brings in 13,000 Muslims who support suicide bombings every year.
[03:05:07.200 --> 03:05:08.200]  Let me explain.
[03:05:08.200 --> 03:05:13.880]  This headline is based upon Pew research polling data, which is among the most respected polling
[03:05:13.880 --> 03:05:15.440]  firms in the world.
[03:05:15.440 --> 03:05:21.000]  And it is an alarming statistic considering the reality of the Pew research poll that
[03:05:21.000 --> 03:05:28.080]  says 13% of Muslims inside of the United States support suicide bombing, at least some
[03:05:28.080 --> 03:05:33.480]  of the time in the U S now has over a hundred thousand Muslims being granted into the country
[03:05:33.480 --> 03:05:34.480]  each year.
[03:05:34.480 --> 03:05:40.000]  Meanwhile, Obama continues to mock those of us Americans who are concerned about radical
[03:05:40.000 --> 03:05:42.600]  Muslim refugees entering the country.
[03:05:42.600 --> 03:05:44.960]  Now they're worried about three year old orphans.
[03:05:44.960 --> 03:05:50.120]  But facts are facts regardless of the Obama administration's decision to ignore them.
[03:05:50.120 --> 03:05:56.360]  The radical mindsets of the Muslim population in America is here and it is growing.
[03:05:56.360 --> 03:06:05.360]  You can learn more right now at info wars.com and it's that type of behavior that spurred
[03:06:05.360 --> 03:06:11.320]  me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and
[03:06:11.320 --> 03:06:12.840]  help children focus.
[03:06:12.840 --> 03:06:16.000]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[03:06:16.000 --> 03:06:20.960]  Modern music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it, young humans have not yet developed
[03:06:20.960 --> 03:06:25.480]  their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[03:06:25.480 --> 03:06:29.840]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic
[03:06:29.840 --> 03:06:30.840]  drugs.
[03:06:30.840 --> 03:06:34.920]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients
[03:06:34.920 --> 03:06:36.960]  that children would actually like and take.

[03:08:25.800 --> 03:08:30.040]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[03:08:30.040 --> 03:08:31.680]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:08:31.680 --> 03:08:37.720]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Friday, December 11th, 2015.
[03:08:37.720 --> 03:08:40.280]  I'm David Knight, your host in this fourth hour.
[03:08:40.280 --> 03:08:44.280]  I was just watching the trailer for Mike Norris' new film, Amerageddon.
[03:08:44.280 --> 03:08:48.040]  I'm really anxious to see that in spite of the fact I have a tiny role in it.
[03:08:48.040 --> 03:08:49.800]  I don't like to watch myself.
[03:08:49.800 --> 03:08:52.240]  I don't watch my news reports.
[03:08:52.240 --> 03:08:55.760]  I don't like to see myself on television, but I do want to see that movie.
[03:08:55.760 --> 03:09:01.280]  And speaking of movies, we have Snake Plisken weighing in on the no-fly list.
[03:09:01.280 --> 03:09:06.200]  And I'm not talking about a clever little clip that we put together where we got the
[03:09:06.200 --> 03:09:08.000]  actual from the movie Escape from New York.
[03:09:08.000 --> 03:09:09.960]  Now I'm talking about the actor Kurt Russell.
[03:09:09.960 --> 03:09:15.840]  He has a very reasonable pushback against an interviewer who's haranguing him about
[03:09:15.840 --> 03:09:19.200]  the new Quentin Tarantino movie, Hateful Eight, that he's in.
[03:09:19.200 --> 03:09:20.560]  It's a Western.
[03:09:20.560 --> 03:09:24.920]  And this guy is coming after him because there's gun violence.
[03:09:24.920 --> 03:09:26.920]  And this is said in the old West.
[03:09:26.920 --> 03:09:30.360]  And Kurt Russell at first is like, are you serious?
[03:09:30.360 --> 03:09:33.320]  Can't you tell the difference between art and real life?
[03:09:33.320 --> 03:09:35.160]  But then he does get serious.
[03:09:35.160 --> 03:09:39.440]  Kurt Russell schools this guy on gun control and on terrorism.
[03:09:39.440 --> 03:09:40.760]  So we're going to have a clip from that.
[03:09:40.760 --> 03:09:47.040]  We're also going to talk a little bit about another film, a new documentary, called Killing
[03:09:47.040 --> 03:09:49.280]  Them Safely.
[03:09:49.280 --> 03:09:50.280]  Killing Them Softly.
[03:09:50.280 --> 03:09:51.280]  Killing Them Safely.
[03:09:51.280 --> 03:09:56.480]  A very interesting documentary that's just been released about the Taser Company.
[03:09:56.480 --> 03:10:00.080]  There's one company that makes these electronic devices.
[03:10:00.080 --> 03:10:04.720]  And it's interesting how the Taser Company reacted to this filmmaker's film when they
[03:10:04.720 --> 03:10:05.720]  put it up on iTunes.
[03:10:05.720 --> 03:10:06.720]  But I think it's very interesting.
[03:10:06.720 --> 03:10:11.280]  I'd like to talk to this filmmaker, do an interview with him.
[03:10:11.280 --> 03:10:12.920]  I'm going to watch this film this weekend.
[03:10:12.920 --> 03:10:14.840]  I wasn't aware of it till I saw actually.
[03:10:14.840 --> 03:10:19.360]  Interesting thing about it, it's kind of the Streisand Effect, right?
[03:10:19.360 --> 03:10:24.760]  They didn't like his take on the film on Taser.
[03:10:24.760 --> 03:10:25.760]  So they trolled him.
[03:10:25.760 --> 03:10:27.160]  Give him a lot of one-star reviews.
[03:10:27.160 --> 03:10:29.600]  They used their real names.
[03:10:29.600 --> 03:10:31.840]  And so it became an issue.
[03:10:31.840 --> 03:10:32.840]  Forbes picked it up.
[03:10:32.840 --> 03:10:34.480]  A lot of different news sites have picked it up.
[03:10:34.480 --> 03:10:36.960]  So now congratulations, Taser.
[03:10:36.960 --> 03:10:41.800]  You didn't like that documentary about these high-tech whips that you're creating for police
[03:10:41.800 --> 03:10:43.360]  forces worldwide?
[03:10:43.360 --> 03:10:46.360]  Well, now everybody knows about this documentary.
[03:10:46.360 --> 03:10:51.600]  So we'll talk about that as well as a new development and something I talked about last
[03:10:51.600 --> 03:10:52.600]  night on the nightly news.
[03:10:52.600 --> 03:10:57.200]  And that is psychiatric drugs being prescribed to infants.
[03:10:57.200 --> 03:11:03.560]  And these are anti-psychotic drugs that have very severe effects on these infants.
[03:11:03.560 --> 03:11:04.800]  There's been an update on that.
[03:11:04.800 --> 03:11:06.240]  I'm going to tell you about that as well.
[03:11:06.240 --> 03:11:10.480]  So let's first get to the gun issue.
[03:11:10.480 --> 03:11:16.960]  As I point out, this is an interview where this fellow is pushing against Kurt Russell
[03:11:16.960 --> 03:11:20.160]  relentlessly, coming after him again and again.
[03:11:20.160 --> 03:11:24.040]  So I just cut out the spots where Kurt Russell said, all right, all right, you want to talk
[03:11:24.040 --> 03:11:25.480]  about what's really going on?
[03:11:25.480 --> 03:11:26.480]  Let's talk about what's really going on.
[03:11:26.480 --> 03:11:27.480]  Here's the first clip.
[03:11:27.480 --> 03:11:33.000]  You know, between Paris and San Bernardino, there's this thing that sudden violence as
[03:11:33.000 --> 03:11:39.040]  a normal day-to-day act coming from the gun culture, coming from everything else.
[03:11:39.040 --> 03:11:40.680]  It's a different vibe, you know.
[03:11:40.680 --> 03:11:47.000]  I mean, I don't, yeah, I don't understand the concepts of conversation of the gun culture.
[03:11:47.000 --> 03:11:50.400]  We've lived with guns since what, the 7th century or something.
[03:11:50.400 --> 03:11:51.400]  I don't know.
[03:11:51.400 --> 03:11:55.680]  We all know that right now, guns is a trope, it's a, I mean, it's not a trope, it's a
[03:11:55.680 --> 03:11:56.680]  totem, it's a metaphor.
[03:11:56.680 --> 03:11:57.680]  Is that a meme?
[03:11:57.680 --> 03:11:58.680]  I don't know.
[03:11:58.680 --> 03:11:59.680]  It's just a franchise.
[03:11:59.680 --> 03:12:00.680]  White guys need.
[03:12:00.680 --> 03:12:02.680]  It makes them feel good because they're being stopped.
[03:12:02.680 --> 03:12:03.680]  You can say what you want.
[03:12:03.680 --> 03:12:04.680]  I don't agree with that.
[03:12:04.680 --> 03:12:05.680]  It makes people feel like a man.
[03:12:05.680 --> 03:12:06.680]  It makes people feel like a man.
[03:12:06.680 --> 03:12:07.680]  Well, you can look.
[03:12:07.680 --> 03:12:11.160]  If you think that, if you think gun control or something like that is going to change
[03:12:11.160 --> 03:12:14.320]  a terrorist point of view, I think you're like out of your mind.
[03:12:14.320 --> 03:12:18.520]  I think you're like, I think anybody is, I think it's absolutely insane.
[03:12:18.520 --> 03:12:23.320]  The problem, the problem we're having right now is that we don't have the concepts of
[03:12:23.320 --> 03:12:31.960]  how to turn it around and say, you know, I, you may think you've got me worried about
[03:12:31.960 --> 03:12:32.960]  what you're going to do.
[03:12:32.960 --> 03:12:36.920]  Dude, you're about to find out what I'm going to do and that's going to worry you a lot
[03:12:36.920 --> 03:12:39.720]  more and that's what we need.
[03:12:39.720 --> 03:12:45.760]  That will change the concept of gun culture, as you call it, to something of reality, which
[03:12:45.760 --> 03:12:53.200]  is if I'm a hockey team and I got a guy bearing down on me as a goaltender, I'm not concerned
[03:12:53.200 --> 03:12:54.600]  about what he's going to do.
[03:12:54.600 --> 03:12:57.320]  I'm going to make him concerned about what I'm going to do.
[03:12:57.320 --> 03:12:58.320]  Yeah.
[03:12:58.320 --> 03:12:59.320]  That is perfect.
[03:12:59.320 --> 03:13:00.320]  He just took that whole thing.
[03:13:00.320 --> 03:13:01.960]  The guy said, oh, you know, you got the culture.
[03:13:01.960 --> 03:13:03.240]  It's like a, is it a meme?
[03:13:03.240 --> 03:13:04.240]  Is it a trope?
[03:13:04.240 --> 03:13:05.240]  It's something like that.
[03:13:05.240 --> 03:13:09.840]  And we've got to talk about that and he goes, look, if you think you're going to change
[03:13:09.840 --> 03:13:13.320]  a terrorist point of view, you're out of your mind, man.
[03:13:13.320 --> 03:13:17.400]  He says, I'm going to turn it around like a hockey game where I'm bearing down on the
[03:13:17.400 --> 03:13:18.400]  goalie.
[03:13:18.400 --> 03:13:20.520]  He's going to be worried about what I'm going to do.
[03:13:20.520 --> 03:13:24.360]  That's the whole point of having an armed citizenry.
[03:13:24.360 --> 03:13:29.320]  That's why an armed citizenry was the constitutional approach to protect our country, certainly
[03:13:29.320 --> 03:13:30.760]  for our own self-defense.
[03:13:30.760 --> 03:13:35.760]  It was never the idea like the New York Times came out this last weekend where they had
[03:13:35.760 --> 03:13:36.760]  a collective editorial.
[03:13:36.760 --> 03:13:40.520]  Put it on the front page, first time they've done that in decades, a collective editorial
[03:13:40.520 --> 03:13:45.360]  from the New York Times staff saying, you need to give up your guns because the government
[03:13:45.360 --> 03:13:47.280]  and the police are going to protect you.
[03:13:47.280 --> 03:13:51.280]  And if you have guns, it just makes their job more dangerous and difficult.
[03:13:51.280 --> 03:13:53.600]  No, they don't do that.
[03:13:53.600 --> 03:13:57.080]  They've had numerous court decisions where they've been sued by people because people
[03:13:57.080 --> 03:13:59.720]  said you didn't do a very good job of protecting me or my family.
[03:13:59.720 --> 03:14:01.160]  And they said, that's not our job.
[03:14:01.160 --> 03:14:02.160]  That's not our job.
[03:14:02.160 --> 03:14:05.480]  Our job is to enforce the government's policies.
[03:14:05.480 --> 03:14:07.720]  Our job is to write tickets for you.
[03:14:07.720 --> 03:14:10.280]  Our job is to make sure you obey the orders.
[03:14:10.280 --> 03:14:12.320]  It is not to defend you.
[03:14:12.320 --> 03:14:16.880]  And we've had honest police chiefs who said, we'll catch the bad guys, but understand it's
[03:14:16.880 --> 03:14:18.640]  going to take a while before we can get there.
[03:14:18.640 --> 03:14:24.520]  Have many police chiefs talking about that, saying to their citizens, sheriffs and others
[03:14:24.520 --> 03:14:28.560]  saying, look, you need to arm yourself, you need to learn how to use this safely because
[03:14:28.560 --> 03:14:31.880]  we cannot respond quickly enough to help you.
[03:14:31.880 --> 03:14:36.520]  Just as we saw the data coming out this last week saying, when people are armed, the average
[03:14:36.520 --> 03:14:41.140]  number of people killed in a mass shooting is just over two.
[03:14:41.140 --> 03:14:45.200]  When there's nobody around that is carrying, the number of people who are killed is just
[03:14:45.200 --> 03:14:46.560]  over 14.
[03:14:46.560 --> 03:14:48.560]  That's precisely what Kurt Russell is talking about.
[03:14:48.560 --> 03:14:49.720]  But then there's another clip.
[03:14:49.720 --> 03:14:50.960]  Let's play this second clip.
[03:14:50.960 --> 03:14:52.440]  The interviewer keeps coming after him.
[03:14:52.440 --> 03:14:53.440]  Let's play that clip.
[03:14:53.440 --> 03:14:59.000]  So while this point was that the guys who are on the no fly list, no fly list because
[03:14:59.000 --> 03:15:02.920]  of terrorist connections can get a gun pretty easily.
[03:15:02.920 --> 03:15:05.120]  They can also make a bomb pretty easily.
[03:15:05.120 --> 03:15:06.120]  Yeah.
[03:15:06.120 --> 03:15:08.120]  So they can also get knives and stab you.
[03:15:08.120 --> 03:15:09.120]  What are you going to do about that?
[03:15:09.120 --> 03:15:11.120]  They can get cars and run you over with them.
[03:15:11.120 --> 03:15:12.120]  What are you going to do about that?
[03:15:12.120 --> 03:15:13.120]  No.
[03:15:13.120 --> 03:15:14.120]  What are you going to do about that?
[03:15:14.120 --> 03:15:15.120]  They didn't kill the people in San Bernardino.
[03:15:15.120 --> 03:15:18.120]  Oh, they've killed others that way, haven't they?
[03:15:18.120 --> 03:15:19.120]  Yes.
[03:15:19.120 --> 03:15:20.120]  Yeah.
[03:15:20.120 --> 03:15:21.120]  So what are you going to do?
[03:15:21.120 --> 03:15:22.120]  Outlaw everything?
[03:15:22.120 --> 03:15:23.720]  That isn't the answer.
[03:15:23.720 --> 03:15:26.120]  Just put some controls.
[03:15:26.120 --> 03:15:27.120]  Put some controls?
[03:15:27.120 --> 03:15:28.120]  What?
[03:15:28.120 --> 03:15:31.120]  So the people who want to defend themselves can't?
[03:15:31.120 --> 03:15:33.120]  No, not so you can't.
[03:15:33.120 --> 03:15:35.000]  Just so the idiots can't get hold of them.
[03:15:35.000 --> 03:15:36.920]  Do you really believe they're not going to?
[03:15:36.920 --> 03:15:38.120]  Are you serious about that?
[03:15:38.120 --> 03:15:39.120]  Yeah.
[03:15:39.120 --> 03:15:40.120]  Are you seriously?
[03:15:40.120 --> 03:15:41.120]  What good will that?
[03:15:41.120 --> 03:15:42.120]  Oh, my God.
[03:15:42.120 --> 03:15:43.120]  You and I just disagree.
[03:15:43.120 --> 03:15:44.120]  Okay.
[03:15:44.120 --> 03:15:45.120]  You and I just disagree.
[03:15:45.120 --> 03:15:53.120]  And I understand that you think that you can control the behavior of people that are dead
[03:15:53.120 --> 03:15:57.760]  set on taking your way of life away from you.
[03:15:57.760 --> 03:16:00.120]  I think you think you can control that.
[03:16:00.120 --> 03:16:01.120]  No.
[03:16:01.120 --> 03:16:05.120]  And there's only one thing you can do with that and say, no, dude, that's not going to
[03:16:05.120 --> 03:16:06.120]  happen.
[03:16:06.120 --> 03:16:07.120]  That's just not going to happen.
[03:16:07.120 --> 03:16:08.120]  We're going to speak with you, man.
[03:16:08.120 --> 03:16:09.120]  Good talking with you.
[03:16:09.120 --> 03:16:10.120]  Good talking with you.
[03:16:10.120 --> 03:16:11.120]  Yeah.
[03:16:11.120 --> 03:16:16.280]  Well, I got to say, I thought America was dead, but you know, Snake Pliskin, Kurt Russell
[03:16:16.280 --> 03:16:19.040]  has just revived my faith in America.
[03:16:19.040 --> 03:16:21.880]  Common sense telling this guy, look, you're going to put them on a list.
[03:16:21.880 --> 03:16:25.120]  You're going to take away their rights because they're on a list.
[03:16:25.120 --> 03:16:29.920]  You think these people, if you think you're really going to keep them from getting a gun
[03:16:29.920 --> 03:16:33.620]  because they can't go in and buy one retail, you think they can't get a gun?
[03:16:33.620 --> 03:16:34.860]  Give me a break.
[03:16:34.860 --> 03:16:35.860]  Give me a break.
[03:16:35.860 --> 03:16:37.760]  Any points out, of course, they can do bombs pretty easily.
[03:16:37.760 --> 03:16:39.720]  They can use cars.
[03:16:39.720 --> 03:16:41.040]  America used to live in North Carolina.
[03:16:41.040 --> 03:16:43.520]  We had a Muslim drive a car into a crowd.
[03:16:43.520 --> 03:16:47.520]  They didn't report that too much because UNC loves the Muslim community.
[03:16:47.520 --> 03:16:54.280]  They had kumbaya parties after 9-11, but that's the reality of things, folks.
[03:16:54.280 --> 03:16:56.080]  But here's the other reality.
[03:16:56.080 --> 03:16:59.840]  The other reality is that we have something called due process in the law.
[03:16:59.840 --> 03:17:05.360]  The other reality is we got a president who's got not only a no fly list, he's got an indefinite
[03:17:05.360 --> 03:17:06.360]  detention list.
[03:17:06.360 --> 03:17:09.000]  He's also got an assassination list.
[03:17:09.000 --> 03:17:10.920]  Which list are you on?
[03:17:10.920 --> 03:17:14.480]  He could put you on any one of these lists at any time, and you won't even know it.
[03:17:14.480 --> 03:17:18.200]  You won't know that you're on the no fly list until they shut you down some way, until
[03:17:18.200 --> 03:17:20.400]  they say, sorry, you can't travel.
[03:17:20.400 --> 03:17:24.840]  You can't buy something to defend yourself, or whatever their sanctions they want to put
[03:17:24.840 --> 03:17:26.840]  on attached to this list.
[03:17:26.840 --> 03:17:31.200]  You don't know that you're on the indefinite detention without trial list, either, until
[03:17:31.200 --> 03:17:34.760]  the military shows up at your door one day and takes you off to a concentration camp
[03:17:34.760 --> 03:17:36.960]  because these are secret lists.
[03:17:36.960 --> 03:17:41.600]  This is the kind of country that we're creating in this world, in America, right here.
[03:17:41.600 --> 03:17:46.120]  This is precisely what is wrong with this country, is the fact that none of our politicians
[03:17:46.120 --> 03:17:49.120]  will stand up and object to the fact that we have a list.
[03:17:49.120 --> 03:17:52.520]  They'll debate as to what should be done to the people that the government has put on
[03:17:52.520 --> 03:17:55.240]  the list without process.
[03:17:55.240 --> 03:17:59.720]  Let me read to you the Constitution, since we've got a lot of politicians who either
[03:17:59.720 --> 03:18:02.720]  don't care or don't know what's in the Constitution.
[03:18:02.720 --> 03:18:07.920]  The Fifth Amendment says no one shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property.
[03:18:07.920 --> 03:18:11.640]  And of course, our rights are a property, okay?
[03:18:11.640 --> 03:18:16.080]  Without due process of law, nor shall private property be taken for public use without just
[03:18:16.080 --> 03:18:17.080]  compensation.
[03:18:17.080 --> 03:18:19.080]  I'm in a domain, Donald Trump.
[03:18:19.080 --> 03:18:25.840]  Sixth Amendment says the right to a speedy trial, a public trial, a public trial folks.
[03:18:25.840 --> 03:18:27.920]  That means no star chamber.
[03:18:27.920 --> 03:18:33.840]  They wrote this because there was a secretive judicial process in England that could try
[03:18:33.840 --> 03:18:38.160]  people in abstention without them even knowing they've been indicted, without them being
[03:18:38.160 --> 03:18:39.600]  able to confront their witnesses.
[03:18:39.600 --> 03:18:41.440]  Oh yeah, that's in there too.
[03:18:41.440 --> 03:18:45.800]  You get a public trial, a speedy trial, an impartial jury.
[03:18:45.800 --> 03:18:51.280]  You are to be informed of the nature and the consent of the accusations against you.
[03:18:51.280 --> 03:18:56.800]  Not put on a secret list by Obama or by George Bush or by Donald Trump or whoever wants to
[03:18:56.800 --> 03:18:58.760]  put you on a list, no.
[03:18:58.760 --> 03:19:01.680]  You are to be confronted with the witnesses against you.
[03:19:01.680 --> 03:19:05.920]  You are to be allowed to provide witnesses in your favor.
[03:19:05.920 --> 03:19:09.560]  And if you can't afford one, you have the assistance of a counsel for your defense.
[03:19:09.560 --> 03:19:11.520]  Oh, but they get around this.
[03:19:11.520 --> 03:19:12.960]  They say, but these are not.
[03:19:12.960 --> 03:19:13.960]  This is not criminal.
[03:19:13.960 --> 03:19:15.520]  We haven't charged anybody with it.
[03:19:15.520 --> 03:19:16.520]  This is just civil.
[03:19:16.520 --> 03:19:21.040]  We just take your property with the drug war by saying it's a civil asset forfeiture.
[03:19:21.040 --> 03:19:23.600]  That's why we don't have to give you a trial.
[03:19:23.600 --> 03:19:24.600]  Nonsense.
[03:19:24.600 --> 03:19:25.600]  Nonsense.
[03:19:25.600 --> 03:19:29.600]  If you're going to fall for that kind of sophistry, you're just a slave.
[03:19:29.600 --> 03:19:31.760]  And when they talk about, oh, well, we're not charging you.
[03:19:31.760 --> 03:19:34.200]  We're just going to punish you without charging it.
[03:19:34.200 --> 03:19:36.200]  We're going to punish you without giving you a trial.
[03:19:36.200 --> 03:19:39.600]  And when we come back, we're going to talk about what some of the Republican candidates
[03:19:39.600 --> 03:19:40.600]  think.
[03:19:40.600 --> 03:19:44.320]  We know what the Democrats think about this, taking your guns if you're on some super
[03:19:44.320 --> 03:19:48.600]  secret list that they put you on without any due process.
[03:19:48.600 --> 03:19:51.320]  We're going to tell you what the Republicans say about that when we come back.
[03:19:51.320 --> 03:20:00.760]  Let's stay with us.
[03:20:00.760 --> 03:20:04.960]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better
[03:20:04.960 --> 03:20:08.520]  than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood
[03:20:08.520 --> 03:20:11.040]  sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?
[03:20:11.040 --> 03:20:15.280]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives, and you could be one of
[03:20:15.280 --> 03:20:16.280]  them.
[03:20:16.280 --> 03:20:17.800]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[03:20:17.800 --> 03:20:22.200]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of
[03:20:22.200 --> 03:20:23.600]  Heart and Body Extract.
[03:20:23.600 --> 03:20:27.880]  What happens with the formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary
[03:20:27.880 --> 03:20:33.600]  vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[03:20:33.600 --> 03:20:38.120]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol,
[03:20:38.120 --> 03:20:40.040]  clean and unclog the arteries.
[03:20:40.040 --> 03:20:43.400]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics.
[03:20:43.400 --> 03:20:48.520]  The body is an amazing thing, it simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[03:20:48.520 --> 03:20:51.040]  Heart and Body Extract gets results.

[03:24:14.560 --> 03:24:15.560]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:15.560 --> 03:24:18.880]  I'm David Knight, your host on this Friday, December 11th.
[03:24:18.880 --> 03:24:20.400]  We have some specials today.
[03:24:20.400 --> 03:24:25.800]  One of those is, of course, free shipping on all InfowarsStore.com orders for at least
[03:24:25.800 --> 03:24:26.800]  the next week.
[03:24:26.800 --> 03:24:29.400]  That ends, I think, yes, it is one week.
[03:24:29.400 --> 03:24:30.760]  It's December 18th.
[03:24:30.760 --> 03:24:35.440]  We also have some other specials, the Essentials Pack, Survival Shield X2, Supermale Female
[03:24:35.440 --> 03:24:39.600]  Vitality Silver Bullet, 33% off if you get those three together.
[03:24:39.600 --> 03:24:45.680]  Also a deep cleansing pack where you get deep cleanse, living defense, and oxy powder, 28%
[03:24:45.680 --> 03:24:46.680]  off.
[03:24:46.680 --> 03:24:50.920]  Vitamin Sun, Vitamin D3, 15% off.
[03:24:50.920 --> 03:24:56.040]  All of those are there, plus you get free shipping, again, for anything that you order
[03:24:56.040 --> 03:24:57.040]  at InfowarsStore.
[03:24:57.040 --> 03:25:01.560]  I make sure to look at the new product that we have, the Infowars Solar Base Station
[03:25:01.560 --> 03:25:02.560]  Power Supply.
[03:25:02.560 --> 03:25:05.040]  That's something I've looked at buying for myself for quite some time.
[03:25:05.040 --> 03:25:10.680]  I haven't done it before because of the price, but the price is very, very aggressive on
[03:25:10.680 --> 03:25:14.840]  this solar power plus battery plus inverter and AC outlets.
[03:25:14.840 --> 03:25:20.440]  It's a great, something everybody should have as a backup generator at the very least.
[03:25:20.440 --> 03:25:24.160]  Now, I want to get back to what we were talking about in the last segment.
[03:25:24.160 --> 03:25:25.960]  And that is, are we going to take people's guns?
[03:25:25.960 --> 03:25:29.800]  Are we going to start to punish people without due process?
[03:25:29.800 --> 03:25:35.040]  Because throughout the war on drugs, since the time of Ronald Reagan, we have been stealing
[03:25:35.040 --> 03:25:39.480]  property from people without charging them of a crime, without convicting them.
[03:25:39.480 --> 03:25:44.680]  And so now, we're going to start taking away other things from people, things like their
[03:25:44.680 --> 03:25:47.240]  rights to have and own a gun.
[03:25:47.240 --> 03:25:50.400]  We're going to take that away because we're going to put them on a secret list that they
[03:25:50.400 --> 03:25:51.400]  don't know.
[03:25:51.400 --> 03:25:53.040]  We're not going to charge them with any crimes.
[03:25:53.040 --> 03:25:55.440]  We're not going to take them through the due process procedure.
[03:25:55.440 --> 03:25:56.840]  They're not going to get a public trial.
[03:25:56.840 --> 03:25:58.440]  As a matter of fact, they won't even know.
[03:25:58.440 --> 03:25:59.440]  How's that?
[03:25:59.440 --> 03:26:02.160]  They won't even know until they go to get their gun or go to fly on a plane.
[03:26:02.160 --> 03:26:03.840]  They won't even know that they're on a no fly list.
[03:26:03.840 --> 03:26:04.840]  Won't they be great?
[03:26:04.840 --> 03:26:09.840]  And of course, it isn't going to help us to fight the terrorist because they're going
[03:26:09.840 --> 03:26:11.520]  to find their ways to get guns.
[03:26:11.520 --> 03:26:13.600]  They're not going to go down to Walmart to get their guns.
[03:26:13.600 --> 03:26:17.200]  They'll do that if it's really easy, but that's not really much of an obstacle anywhere else
[03:26:17.200 --> 03:26:18.200]  for them to get guns.
[03:26:18.200 --> 03:26:21.440]  They can get guns in the Northeast anywhere they want to.
[03:26:21.440 --> 03:26:25.200]  Black markets spring up wherever you've got prohibition folks.
[03:26:25.200 --> 03:26:26.200]  Remember alcohol?
[03:26:26.200 --> 03:26:27.200]  Remember the war on drugs?
[03:26:27.200 --> 03:26:29.040]  Yeah, we're still doing that, aren't we?
[03:26:29.040 --> 03:26:31.120]  Forty-some-odd years, 44 years.
[03:26:31.120 --> 03:26:36.480]  It was 1971, Richard Nixon put that in, enacting that UN agenda.
[03:26:36.480 --> 03:26:40.960]  Down to the letter, down to the last, all four schedules, the drugs that they wanted
[03:26:40.960 --> 03:26:42.480]  to put, schedule by schedule.
[03:26:42.480 --> 03:26:45.200]  That was created by the UN in 1961.
[03:26:45.200 --> 03:26:47.520]  Conservatives ought to be concerned about that.
[03:26:47.520 --> 03:26:52.600]  The UN created this agenda in 1961 and Richard Nixon implemented it in 1971 and called it
[03:26:52.600 --> 03:26:53.600]  the war on drugs.
[03:26:53.600 --> 03:26:58.120]  And then Richard, and then Ronald Reagan came in and said, we're going to take people's
[03:26:58.120 --> 03:27:03.360]  property without convicting them, without even charging them.
[03:27:03.360 --> 03:27:08.680]  And we'll get around the Constitution by saying it's not a criminal action, it's a civil action.
[03:27:08.680 --> 03:27:13.080]  And so we've allowed that to happen, go on for now, 30 years.
[03:27:13.080 --> 03:27:16.240]  So Obama thinks that he can take other rights of ours, and let's see who the Republican
[03:27:16.240 --> 03:27:20.480]  candidates are, because we all know that Hillary agrees with that, with Obama's action.
[03:27:20.480 --> 03:27:24.280]  We've got a Connecticut governor who is now saying that he's going to start implementing
[03:27:24.280 --> 03:27:25.280]  that.
[03:27:25.280 --> 03:27:28.080]  He's going to look and see if you're on the no-fly list, and if you are, then he's going
[03:27:28.080 --> 03:27:29.680]  to take away your rights to have guns.
[03:27:29.680 --> 03:27:35.480]  I think people need to arrest him, arrest that Connecticut governor who thinks that he's
[03:27:35.480 --> 03:27:40.480]  going to turn America into some kind of a star chamber dictatorship.
[03:27:40.480 --> 03:27:45.000]  Or some kind of star chamber Spanish inquisition can put you on a list and take everything
[03:27:45.000 --> 03:27:46.240]  that you've got.
[03:27:46.240 --> 03:27:49.640]  Because they're not going to stop just by confiscating your car on the road with civil
[03:27:49.640 --> 03:27:50.640]  asset forfeiture.
[03:27:50.640 --> 03:27:53.680]  They're not going to stop by taking your guns, it's going to just continue to go.
[03:27:53.680 --> 03:27:57.280]  They're going to have more lists, like I pointed out, he's already got a no-fly list, an indefinite
[03:27:57.280 --> 03:28:00.120]  detention list, an assassination list.
[03:28:00.120 --> 03:28:01.640]  Are you on any of those?
[03:28:01.640 --> 03:28:06.440]  Well, you don't know, do you, because there's no rule of law in America anymore.
[03:28:06.440 --> 03:28:08.240]  So where do the Republican candidates fall on this?
[03:28:08.240 --> 03:28:13.200]  Well, we had this last Sunday, several of them were asked about this specific situation.
[03:28:13.200 --> 03:28:19.000]  If somebody's on a no-fly list, and the assumption that the Democrats have, the assumption the
[03:28:19.000 --> 03:28:21.760]  mainstream media is putting out there, if you're on that list, you're a terrorist.
[03:28:21.760 --> 03:28:24.000]  It's like, no, you're not, no, you're not.
[03:28:24.000 --> 03:28:28.240]  So you had, that was the first line of defense, and the only line really that they brought
[03:28:28.240 --> 03:28:32.760]  up, because they don't want to push back against the idea that they're not giving people
[03:28:32.760 --> 03:28:34.760]  due process.
[03:28:34.760 --> 03:28:38.040]  Republican candidates are not standing up for that, except for Rand Paul.
[03:28:38.040 --> 03:28:42.080]  He's the only one who's had any problem with civil asset forfeiture, but Marco Rubio and
[03:28:42.080 --> 03:28:43.080]  Jeb Bush don't.
[03:28:43.080 --> 03:28:48.240]  At least Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush said, look, you had people like former Senator Ted Kennedy,
[03:28:48.240 --> 03:28:49.800]  who showed up on the list.
[03:28:49.800 --> 03:28:52.800]  You had people like Cat Stevens show up on the list.
[03:28:52.800 --> 03:28:57.080]  Conservative writer Stephen Hayes, they got put on the no-fly list, and they were put
[03:28:57.080 --> 03:28:59.040]  on there by accident.
[03:28:59.040 --> 03:29:02.200]  You got people who have similar names to somebody else put on there.
[03:29:02.200 --> 03:29:05.960]  We've had toddlers and infants put on the no-fly list.
[03:29:05.960 --> 03:29:08.920]  So that was their line of defense, and so we're not going to take away people's guidance
[03:29:08.920 --> 03:29:10.840]  because they're on some list.
[03:29:10.840 --> 03:29:16.080]  And Rubio goes on to say, though, just, he says, now, if it were a perfect list, if it
[03:29:16.080 --> 03:29:20.200]  were a perfect list, are you kidding me?
[03:29:20.200 --> 03:29:21.700]  Read the Constitution.
[03:29:21.700 --> 03:29:25.240]  You're not going to have your property taken away without due process.
[03:29:25.240 --> 03:29:28.200]  Due process means it's a public trial with witnesses.
[03:29:28.200 --> 03:29:29.320]  You know what the charges are.
[03:29:29.320 --> 03:29:31.240]  You know you're being charged with something.
[03:29:31.240 --> 03:29:33.560]  So there isn't any perfect list.
[03:29:33.560 --> 03:29:36.040]  There's something called due process.
[03:29:36.040 --> 03:29:40.800]  When we come back, I'm going to tell you about what's going on with this shooting up our
[03:29:40.800 --> 03:29:43.640]  children, not with guns, but with needles.
[03:29:43.640 --> 03:29:44.640]  Stay with us.
[03:29:44.640 --> 03:29:49.520]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:49.520 --> 03:30:00.360]  Here on the March, the Empire's on the Run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:00.360 --> 03:30:04.960]  Anti-gunners are planning a very pungent protest this weekend in Austin, Texas.
[03:30:04.960 --> 03:30:10.320]  In response to pro-CCL activists staging a mock mass shooting, counter demonstrators
[03:30:10.320 --> 03:30:13.520]  will resort to waving dildos and mass farting.
[03:30:13.520 --> 03:30:18.400]  Yes, this is the self-defense equivalent of peeing yourself to stop a rape.
[03:30:18.400 --> 03:30:23.280]  The cardboard guns and fake blood come and take at Texas and don't comply.com are pitching
[03:30:23.280 --> 03:30:26.720]  a life and liberty event to end gun-free zones.
[03:30:26.720 --> 03:30:31.000]  The active shooter drill will take place near the University of Texas this Saturday, but
[03:30:31.000 --> 03:30:34.120]  this time, the shooter picks the wrong crowd.
[03:30:34.120 --> 03:30:38.240]  The planned event comes at a particularly tense time in the nation's gun debate and
[03:30:38.240 --> 03:30:42.240]  Texas colleges and universities are debating how to implement the state's new campus
[03:30:42.240 --> 03:30:45.120]  carry law that will start next fall.
[03:30:45.120 --> 03:30:50.080]  The gun control advocates say this event is offensive, and so they're staging a mass
[03:30:50.080 --> 03:30:52.800]  farting and dildo-waving counter-protest.
[03:30:52.800 --> 03:30:55.800]  I fart in your general direction.
[03:30:55.800 --> 03:30:58.440]  Read more about this event at infowars.com.
[03:30:58.440 --> 03:31:03.360]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[03:31:03.360 --> 03:31:08.440]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors
[03:31:08.440 --> 03:31:11.760]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[03:31:11.760 --> 03:31:17.040]  Like one of the key compounds, BiopQQ is backed by major clinical studies.

[03:31:30.840 --> 03:31:33.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[03:31:33.040 --> 03:31:37.080]  You probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because
[03:31:37.080 --> 03:31:38.080]  of brain force.
[03:31:38.080 --> 03:31:41.240]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[03:31:41.240 --> 03:31:43.960]  When you're staring at the computer all day working doing good, you're still damaging
[03:31:43.960 --> 03:31:44.960]  your brain.
[03:31:44.960 --> 03:31:46.760]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[03:31:46.760 --> 03:31:50.000]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it, it has natural things that
[03:31:50.000 --> 03:31:51.000]  do it clean.

[03:32:53.920 --> 03:33:12.600]  I'll see you in the next video, and I'll see you in the next video.
[03:33:12.600 --> 03:33:33.580]  The
[03:33:33.580 --> 03:33:35.660]  on a super secret list.
[03:33:35.660 --> 03:33:36.960]  Of course, that's what Obama wants to do,
[03:33:36.960 --> 03:33:39.820]  Hillary supports it, all the Democrats support it.
[03:33:39.820 --> 03:33:43.100]  Connecticut governor says he's going to enact that.
[03:33:43.100 --> 03:33:44.700]  And this Sunday, you had Marco Rubio and
[03:33:44.700 --> 03:33:46.860]  Jeb Bush come out and say, well,
[03:33:46.860 --> 03:33:48.660]  sometimes there's mistakes on that list,
[03:33:48.660 --> 03:33:50.140]  and so I wouldn't take people's guns.
[03:33:50.140 --> 03:33:52.900]  And it's not exactly a perfect list.
[03:33:52.900 --> 03:33:54.660]  If it were, we could take their guns or whatever.
[03:33:54.660 --> 03:33:57.980]  No, you're not a terrorist because Obama puts you on a list.
[03:33:57.980 --> 03:34:00.100]  You're not a terrorist because the next president
[03:34:00.100 --> 03:34:01.580]  puts you on a list.
[03:34:01.580 --> 03:34:04.900]  You're just living in a post-constitutional America.
[03:34:04.900 --> 03:34:06.260]  But what did some of the other candidates say?
[03:34:06.260 --> 03:34:08.820]  Well, John Kasich was asked the same question and
[03:34:08.820 --> 03:34:12.900]  he said, I think it's a good idea to keep people on the no
[03:34:12.900 --> 03:34:14.500]  fly list from buying guns.
[03:34:14.500 --> 03:34:18.020]  But he added that doing so could tip them off that
[03:34:18.020 --> 03:34:21.580]  they're under watch and it could hurt ongoing investigation.
[03:34:21.580 --> 03:34:25.460]  So let's maybe, yeah, we take their guns, but no, but then
[03:34:25.460 --> 03:34:28.620]  they would know that they're on this super secret list.
[03:34:28.620 --> 03:34:31.500]  Maybe you need to have a double super secret list that we
[03:34:31.500 --> 03:34:33.300]  put them on, I don't know.
[03:34:33.300 --> 03:34:37.660]  Yeah, we got the secret government operates in the dark,
[03:34:37.660 --> 03:34:39.660]  taking our rights without due process.
[03:34:39.660 --> 03:34:42.220]  But yeah, don't tell them that they're on the list.
[03:34:42.220 --> 03:34:44.220]  Then you got Donald Trump.
[03:34:44.220 --> 03:34:47.380]  Donald Trump says, I'd certainly take a look at that.
[03:34:47.380 --> 03:34:50.220]  I'm taking people's guns because they're on the no fly list.
[03:34:50.220 --> 03:34:53.660]  And he says, I'm very strong into the whole thing with
[03:34:53.660 --> 03:34:55.460]  Second Amendment.
[03:34:55.460 --> 03:34:58.980]  But if you can't fly and if you've got some really bad, well,
[03:34:58.980 --> 03:35:01.140]  I would look at that very hard.
[03:35:01.140 --> 03:35:03.500]  Yeah, in other words, yeah, I'm not even going to question the
[03:35:03.500 --> 03:35:04.380]  fact that we got a list.
[03:35:04.380 --> 03:35:05.060]  None of them do.
[03:35:05.060 --> 03:35:05.580]  None of them do.
[03:35:05.580 --> 03:35:07.740]  None of them question what the constitutional requirements
[03:35:07.740 --> 03:35:08.260]  are.
[03:35:08.260 --> 03:35:11.140]  They just look at the pragmatics of this.
[03:35:11.140 --> 03:35:12.100]  Well, can we do this?
[03:35:12.100 --> 03:35:14.660]  Is it going to make us safer if we take everybody's guns, if we
[03:35:14.660 --> 03:35:17.780]  take everybody's rights, if we treat everybody like slaves?
[03:35:17.780 --> 03:35:22.500]  If you don't have any principles, everything is up for grabs.
[03:35:22.500 --> 03:35:26.300]  If you don't have any principles that you hold dear about
[03:35:26.300 --> 03:35:28.220]  freedom of speech, that's up for grabs.
[03:35:28.220 --> 03:35:29.980]  The internet's up for grabs.
[03:35:29.980 --> 03:35:30.860]  You're due process.
[03:35:30.860 --> 03:35:32.580]  Your private property is up for grabs.
[03:35:32.580 --> 03:35:36.220]  If they think they need it or they want it, they just take it.
[03:35:36.220 --> 03:35:40.020]  Because there's no principles to stop them from doing that.
[03:35:40.020 --> 03:35:41.820]  We have another right.
[03:35:41.820 --> 03:35:44.380]  We have a right, and this is not in the Constitution.
[03:35:44.380 --> 03:35:45.580]  It's not protected in the Constitution.
[03:35:45.580 --> 03:35:50.460]  It's not deliberately enumerated in the Constitution as part of the
[03:35:50.460 --> 03:35:50.980]  Bill of Rights.
[03:35:50.980 --> 03:35:53.860]  We have a right to actually overthrow this government.
[03:35:53.860 --> 03:35:55.660]  That's in the Declaration of Independence when they're talking
[03:35:55.660 --> 03:35:57.020]  about why they were doing the revolution.
[03:35:57.020 --> 03:36:00.820]  They said, we have a right and a duty when a government comes
[03:36:00.820 --> 03:36:05.220]  after our rights to alter or abolish that government.
[03:36:05.220 --> 03:36:08.900]  Because the governments were set up to protect our rights.
[03:36:08.900 --> 03:36:13.140]  The governments were not set up so that these guys could have a life long career.
[03:36:13.140 --> 03:36:18.180]  They weren't set up so that they could have a life of luxury,
[03:36:18.180 --> 03:36:20.140]  a lavish pension.
[03:36:20.140 --> 03:36:22.820]  No, they were set up to protect our rights.
[03:36:22.820 --> 03:36:26.580]  But of course, that's what it's become in post-constitutional America.
[03:36:26.580 --> 03:36:30.220]  And before I move on to what's going on with this vaccine situation,
[03:36:30.220 --> 03:36:34.020]  because that's another one of our rights that they're taking away.
[03:36:34.020 --> 03:36:35.540]  I want to talk about this recent court decision.
[03:36:35.540 --> 03:36:39.540]  Of course, this has to do with yet another one of these secret lists,
[03:36:39.540 --> 03:36:41.100]  the assassination list.
[03:36:41.100 --> 03:36:43.300]  Of course, they call it the disposition matrix.
[03:36:43.300 --> 03:36:44.060]  Isn't that great?
[03:36:44.060 --> 03:36:47.780]  Doesn't that sound kind of like a Robert Ludlam spy novel from back when,
[03:36:47.780 --> 03:36:50.700]  was that in 70s or whatever, the disposition matrix?
[03:36:50.700 --> 03:36:53.340]  No, it's nothing but a kill list.
[03:36:53.340 --> 03:36:57.500]  It's just a dirty little kill list by a bunch of people who have no respect for
[03:36:57.500 --> 03:37:01.660]  human life, no respect for the Constitution that they swore to, okay?
[03:37:01.660 --> 03:37:05.740]  The disposition matrix contains the names of terrorist suspects,
[03:37:05.740 --> 03:37:10.620]  a raid against an accounting of resources that they can use to track them down.
[03:37:10.620 --> 03:37:13.620]  It includes sealed indictments.
[03:37:13.620 --> 03:37:16.300]  We can't tell people that we're really going to kill them, can we?
[03:37:16.300 --> 03:37:17.460]  We're tracking them for this.
[03:37:17.460 --> 03:37:20.740]  And it also contains clandestine operations.
[03:37:20.740 --> 03:37:25.540]  Their entire government is now a dark CIA government.
[03:37:25.540 --> 03:37:27.700]  The other ones who run the government folks.
[03:37:27.700 --> 03:37:30.340]  All right, for the last four years, they point out this article in the New York
[03:37:30.340 --> 03:37:33.460]  Times journalist, Charlie Savage has waged a battle against the Obama
[03:37:33.460 --> 03:37:37.180]  administration seeking to reveal the government's legal justifications for
[03:37:37.180 --> 03:37:42.020]  assassinating tear suspects without a trial, without a trial.
[03:37:42.020 --> 03:37:44.500]  I talked last night a great deal about Saudi Arabia.
[03:37:44.500 --> 03:37:48.740]  How they're on track to have the most number of executions ever.
[03:37:50.020 --> 03:37:52.780]  They've already had more than they've had in a couple of decades.
[03:37:52.780 --> 03:37:54.660]  They've had 150 beheadings this year.
[03:37:54.660 --> 03:37:57.740]  Of course, you can get beheaded for just about anything.
[03:37:57.740 --> 03:38:05.340]  If they accuse you of stampeding people at the stoning of Satan ceremony in Mecca,
[03:38:05.340 --> 03:38:08.180]  then they've beheaded 28 people for that.
[03:38:08.180 --> 03:38:11.500]  They've got another 50 people that they say they're going to be head in a single day.
[03:38:11.500 --> 03:38:13.100]  That'll put them over the limit.
[03:38:13.100 --> 03:38:14.180]  That'll set the new record.
[03:38:14.180 --> 03:38:16.180]  So the Guinness people need to get ready for that.
[03:38:16.180 --> 03:38:20.500]  But of course, we have a government that also kills people and doesn't pretend to
[03:38:20.500 --> 03:38:21.860]  have any good reason for it.
[03:38:21.860 --> 03:38:28.260]  So the ACLU has been fighting for 11 memos that would basically give them
[03:38:28.260 --> 03:38:32.180]  an idea of what the legal justification is supposed to be for this.
[03:38:32.180 --> 03:38:33.940]  And of course, there is no legal justification.
[03:38:34.580 --> 03:38:36.340]  I guess you could just get this out in the open.
[03:38:36.340 --> 03:38:39.300]  But we all know there's no legal justification, don't we?
[03:38:39.860 --> 03:38:44.580]  For a government that's just going to assassinate people by putting them on a list.
[03:38:44.580 --> 03:38:46.100]  And of course, that includes Americans.
[03:38:46.100 --> 03:38:50.820]  We saw that happen with Anwar Alalaki and is later than his 16-year-old son,
[03:38:50.820 --> 03:38:52.020]  both of whom were American citizens.
[03:38:52.020 --> 03:38:56.180]  Both of whom used to be whined and dined by the CIA and the Pentagon.
[03:38:56.180 --> 03:38:57.780]  They used to be a part of the inside.
[03:38:57.780 --> 03:39:02.100]  But just like Manuel Noriega, you cross these guys and the CIA,
[03:39:02.100 --> 03:39:06.180]  like George Bush, and pretty soon they start calling you a strongman or a terrorist.
[03:39:06.740 --> 03:39:08.020]  And then they come down and they kill you.
[03:39:08.900 --> 03:39:11.700]  So they say, according to the ACLU, of more than the 500
[03:39:11.700 --> 03:39:15.140]  credibly reported strikes, only nine have been acknowledged on the record.
[03:39:15.780 --> 03:39:20.340]  Of more than 4,800 credibly reported deaths, only 11 have been acknowledged
[03:39:20.340 --> 03:39:21.540]  by the United States government.
[03:39:22.100 --> 03:39:26.100]  We don't know how many individuals are currently on the kill list.
[03:39:26.820 --> 03:39:29.060]  So that's the state of America, folks.
[03:39:29.620 --> 03:39:34.820]  And that's what our Republican candidates can't or won't get their head around.
[03:39:34.820 --> 03:39:37.140]  With the exception of Rand Paul, he has talked about it.
[03:39:37.140 --> 03:39:39.940]  But of course, they're not going to include him in the next debate
[03:39:39.940 --> 03:39:42.580]  because they say that he hasn't made the poll numbers on it.
[03:39:42.580 --> 03:39:47.860]  So we're going to have people who would consider it strongly, like Donald Trump.
[03:39:47.860 --> 03:39:50.900]  He's very strong into that whole Second Amendment thing.
[03:39:50.900 --> 03:39:57.460]  Because his advisors have told him, if you don't want to lose the vote of the Republicans,
[03:39:57.460 --> 03:40:01.620]  get yourself a Bible and a gun and talk about the fact you got a Bible and a gun.
[03:40:01.620 --> 03:40:03.220]  And you'd love these things.
[03:40:03.220 --> 03:40:04.020]  You really love that.
[03:40:04.020 --> 03:40:04.980]  I love that Bible.
[03:40:04.980 --> 03:40:07.620]  I've got this Bible sitting on my counter.
[03:40:07.620 --> 03:40:09.540]  I've got a gun in my back pocket.
[03:40:09.540 --> 03:40:12.820]  I'm into that whole thing about the Second Amendment, whatever that is.
[03:40:13.780 --> 03:40:15.860]  But hey, if you're dangerous, I'll take it.
[03:40:15.860 --> 03:40:20.580]  But if you are somebody that maybe we think we want to label you a terrorist,
[03:40:20.580 --> 03:40:22.980]  we'll shut down the Internet or corners of the Internet.
[03:40:22.980 --> 03:40:24.980]  We'll just censor that and take away that freedom.
[03:40:24.980 --> 03:40:28.420]  And along that line, we have terrorist suspects.
[03:40:28.420 --> 03:40:34.180]  It's not just terrorist suspects, but anybody that the police give an order to.
[03:40:34.180 --> 03:40:40.420]  If you don't do what they tell you, they pull out their new 21st century whip, the Taser.
[03:40:40.420 --> 03:40:45.220]  And of course, the Tasers are made, there's only one company that makes this, Taser International.
[03:40:45.220 --> 03:40:47.380]  They sell it worldwide.
[03:40:48.340 --> 03:40:54.260]  And it basically has become our masters on this plantation that we live on.
[03:40:54.260 --> 03:40:57.140]  Give the overseers this electronic whip.
[03:40:57.140 --> 03:41:00.180]  And they say, if the slaves don't do whatever you tell them to,
[03:41:00.180 --> 03:41:03.540]  as quickly as you want them to, you just hit them with this thing.
[03:41:03.540 --> 03:41:04.580]  Don't worry, it won't kill them.
[03:41:05.140 --> 03:41:06.260]  Well, sometimes it does.
[03:41:06.980 --> 03:41:12.180]  So we've got a documentary film done by filmmaker Nick Buradini.
[03:41:12.180 --> 03:41:15.460]  I think is the way he pronounced his name, called Killing Them Safely.
[03:41:15.460 --> 03:41:22.020]  It just went on to iTunes and he got, I would have known about it, except the employees at
[03:41:22.020 --> 03:41:27.140]  Taser International have been trolling him on iTunes to give him a very low rating.
[03:41:27.140 --> 03:41:31.460]  Now he's gotten 89% positive ratings on Rotten Tomatoes.
[03:41:31.460 --> 03:41:34.500]  He's won a lot of film awards, film festivals.
[03:41:35.540 --> 03:41:37.060]  It's a documentary film, so it's small.
[03:41:37.060 --> 03:41:41.060]  You're probably not going to see it in the theaters, but you can see it, video on demand.
[03:41:41.060 --> 03:41:43.940]  And the film homes in a number of cases where the Taser reduced.
[03:41:43.940 --> 03:41:45.700]  Subsequently, the target died.
[03:41:45.700 --> 03:41:49.700]  In particular, the case of that of Stanley Harlan, a 23-year-old from
[03:41:49.700 --> 03:41:52.500]  Moberly, Missouri, who was pulled over for speeding.
[03:41:52.500 --> 03:41:56.100]  He was tasered for 31 seconds in the chest.
[03:41:57.060 --> 03:41:58.420]  And he died in front of his mother.
[03:41:59.700 --> 03:42:04.740]  Okay, it also looks in depth at the case of Robert Zajtanski.
[03:42:04.740 --> 03:42:05.700]  I don't know how to pronounce his name.
[03:42:05.700 --> 03:42:08.660]  He's a Polish national who died after being hit five times
[03:42:08.660 --> 03:42:12.260]  of the Taser at a Vancouver airport in 2007.
[03:42:12.980 --> 03:42:16.260]  And so yeah, they sell us these non-lethal weapons.
[03:42:16.260 --> 03:42:18.660]  And of course, I think it'd be interesting to talk to this filmmaker,
[03:42:18.660 --> 03:42:22.420]  because this is a big and expanding, rapidly expanding area.
[03:42:22.420 --> 03:42:24.340]  We're talking about the military industrial complex.
[03:42:24.340 --> 03:42:29.700]  There is a police state industrial complex making a lot of money selling weapons to the police.
[03:42:29.700 --> 03:42:33.700]  And it's not just the MRAPs that are being given to them.
[03:42:33.700 --> 03:42:38.020]  Those white elephants that the Pentagon is offloading to the police departments.
[03:42:38.020 --> 03:42:40.020]  No, it's this type of stuff.
[03:42:40.020 --> 03:42:43.940]  There's a lot of quote-unquote non-lethal weapons that are being put out there.
[03:42:43.940 --> 03:42:44.820]  Things that will kill you.
[03:42:44.820 --> 03:42:47.220]  Things that will leave you permanently disabled.
[03:42:47.220 --> 03:42:49.860]  We just had a situation not too long ago here in Bastrop.
[03:42:49.860 --> 03:42:51.460]  We talked about that quite a bit on Info Wars.
[03:42:51.460 --> 03:42:55.860]  If you remember, there was a student in the Bastrop High School.
[03:42:55.860 --> 03:42:56.900]  There was a fight going on.
[03:42:58.340 --> 03:43:00.020]  He broke up the fight, actually.
[03:43:00.020 --> 03:43:00.900]  And he was just standing there.
[03:43:00.900 --> 03:43:01.620]  Nothing was happening.
[03:43:01.620 --> 03:43:05.300]  You'd see that from the video that was taken at the time in the school.
[03:43:05.300 --> 03:43:08.740]  And the in-school cop, which we never had when I was in school.
[03:43:08.740 --> 03:43:09.860]  We didn't need them.
[03:43:09.860 --> 03:43:11.860]  And you don't need them now, by the way.
[03:43:11.860 --> 03:43:17.700]  The in-school cop comes up and just this big fat cop just comes up with his taser drawn, shoots the kid.
[03:43:17.700 --> 03:43:20.420]  And he goes straight down on the concrete floor, hits his head.
[03:43:20.420 --> 03:43:23.940]  And now he has been mentally disabled for the rest of his life.
[03:43:24.500 --> 03:43:26.740]  We've had situations here elsewhere in Texas.
[03:43:26.740 --> 03:43:30.660]  We had there was an automobile accident and the guy was in the car.
[03:43:31.220 --> 03:43:34.340]  And he was having a hypoglycemic incident.
[03:43:34.340 --> 03:43:35.460]  He couldn't talk to the cop.
[03:43:36.020 --> 03:43:37.300]  And the cop was giving him orders.
[03:43:37.300 --> 03:43:37.860]  Get out of the car.
[03:43:37.860 --> 03:43:38.420]  Get out of the car.
[03:43:38.420 --> 03:43:39.300]  He wouldn't get out of the car.
[03:43:39.300 --> 03:43:40.020]  He wouldn't move.
[03:43:40.020 --> 03:43:41.940]  He wasn't doing anything to threaten the officer.
[03:43:41.940 --> 03:43:45.700]  He just wasn't obeying his master quickly enough.
[03:43:45.700 --> 03:43:46.900]  Didn't jump high enough.
[03:43:46.900 --> 03:43:48.100]  Didn't jump quickly enough.
[03:43:48.900 --> 03:43:50.340]  And so he got tasered.
[03:43:51.380 --> 03:43:53.860]  And I think if I remember correctly, well, I shouldn't say it.
[03:43:53.860 --> 03:43:56.100]  I think he died in that particular incident.
[03:43:56.100 --> 03:43:57.300]  We had a stroke.
[03:43:57.300 --> 03:43:59.780]  It was a very serious consequence of that.
[03:43:59.780 --> 03:44:05.860]  Now, let's talk about the other ways that they shoot you.
[03:44:06.500 --> 03:44:09.460]  We are seeing many people who don't respect our right.
[03:44:09.460 --> 03:44:15.540]  It's always this side of the political spectrum that wants to censor people who disagree with them.
[03:44:15.540 --> 03:44:21.140]  They want to take the weapons of people that are rightfully ours to use in our self-defense.
[03:44:21.140 --> 03:44:25.300]  And they want to deny our informed consent when it comes to medication.
[03:44:25.300 --> 03:44:28.980]  And I'm not just talking about forcing you to take a vaccine.
[03:44:28.980 --> 03:44:34.260]  I'm talking about denying your informed consent if you're a cancer patient and you'd like to take medicine.
[03:44:34.260 --> 03:44:34.660]  Okay?
[03:44:34.660 --> 03:44:37.700]  That's the FDA steps in and says, no, no, we haven't approved that yet.
[03:44:37.700 --> 03:44:38.740]  You can't have it.
[03:44:38.740 --> 03:44:42.740]  We're just going to let you die because we haven't tested that to see if it's safe yet.
[03:44:42.740 --> 03:44:43.700]  And it's like, well, it's my body.
[03:44:43.700 --> 03:44:44.500]  It's my decision.
[03:44:44.500 --> 03:44:45.780]  I should be able to make that decision.
[03:44:46.580 --> 03:44:47.620]  But they don't reform.
[03:44:47.620 --> 03:44:49.940]  They don't respect your informed consent.
[03:44:49.940 --> 03:44:51.860]  But I just want to read you this story.
[03:44:51.860 --> 03:44:53.060]  And we talked about this last night.
[03:44:53.060 --> 03:44:54.660]  It was on The New York Times.
[03:44:54.660 --> 03:44:58.900]  Well, they began with a particular incident here.
[03:44:58.900 --> 03:45:00.100]  That's the way they began their article.
[03:45:00.740 --> 03:45:04.340]  Andrew Reyes's seizures began when he was five months old and only got worse.
[03:45:04.980 --> 03:45:09.700]  At 18 months, when an epilepsy medication resulted in violent behavior,
[03:45:09.700 --> 03:45:13.460]  a neurologist prescribed him the antipsychotic Risperdol,
[03:45:13.460 --> 03:45:17.620]  a drug typically used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in adults,
[03:45:17.620 --> 03:45:20.580]  rarely used for children as young as five.
[03:45:20.580 --> 03:45:24.900]  When Andrew screamed in his sleep and seemed to interact with people and objects that were not
[03:45:24.900 --> 03:45:30.180]  there, his frightened mother researched Risperdol and discovered the drug was not approved.
[03:45:31.220 --> 03:45:33.780]  And she said, it was like, just take this.
[03:45:33.780 --> 03:45:35.140]  It's no big deal, the doctor said.
[03:45:35.140 --> 03:45:38.180]  It was like they were tic-tacs, but he was just a baby.
[03:45:38.180 --> 03:45:39.140]  He was just a baby.
[03:45:40.180 --> 03:45:41.380]  Now, think about this.
[03:45:42.020 --> 03:45:44.820]  His seizures began when he was five months old.
[03:45:45.380 --> 03:45:49.380]  Now, I don't know if that was due to a vaccine reaction.
[03:45:49.380 --> 03:45:54.420]  I do know that in the vaccine court, we have seen over and over and over again,
[03:45:54.980 --> 03:45:58.820]  people who immediately after their children got vaccinated,
[03:45:58.820 --> 03:46:03.220]  they began having uncontrollable seizures, continuous seizures.
[03:46:03.220 --> 03:46:08.020]  It's a very common adverse side effect from vaccinations for young children.
[03:46:08.660 --> 03:46:12.020]  As a matter of fact, here in Texas, we had Representative David Simpson,
[03:46:12.660 --> 03:46:17.780]  a stellar individual with a backbone and a rock solid compass.
[03:46:17.780 --> 03:46:25.140]  He was the one who nearly got the TSA shutdown on their child molestation at the airport,
[03:46:25.140 --> 03:46:26.100]  nearly shut that down.
[03:46:26.100 --> 03:46:29.700]  But of course, the TSA said, no, if you guys pass that bill,
[03:46:30.580 --> 03:46:32.660]  we're going to declare Texas a no fly zone.
[03:46:32.660 --> 03:46:35.380]  And our former CIA Lieutenant Governor,
[03:46:35.380 --> 03:46:40.420]  Dewhurst, got the Senate to vote it down after it had passed unanimously in the House.
[03:46:40.420 --> 03:46:44.580]  And of course, we later learned through a mistake of the government in a lawsuit
[03:46:44.580 --> 03:46:49.860]  when they posted unredacted documents from the TSA that at the same time in 2011,
[03:46:49.860 --> 03:46:53.860]  the TSA was saying there is no threat against airports or airplanes.
[03:46:53.860 --> 03:46:57.060]  At the same time, they want to turn Texas into a no fly zone
[03:46:57.060 --> 03:46:59.860]  if we didn't let them play their little TSA games with us.
[03:47:00.740 --> 03:47:04.340]  All right, so going back to this particular account here,
[03:47:05.940 --> 03:47:07.940]  we have the same, the reason I got off onto that.
[03:47:07.940 --> 03:47:13.460]  David Simpson introduced several bills to try to get marijuana decriminalized.
[03:47:13.460 --> 03:47:17.460]  He's a conservative Republican, but he knows what's going on.
[03:47:17.460 --> 03:47:20.020]  And at the very least, what they were able to do,
[03:47:20.020 --> 03:47:22.020]  and it was a couple of people that were in his district,
[03:47:22.020 --> 03:47:25.380]  they had children who had uncontrollable epileptic seizures.
[03:47:25.380 --> 03:47:30.020]  One of the families was able to go to Colorado and get marijuana treatment.
[03:47:30.020 --> 03:47:31.860]  The other family could not afford to go there.
[03:47:32.580 --> 03:47:36.420]  The one who did go to Colorado and get marijuana treatment, their child recovered.
[03:47:37.060 --> 03:47:40.260]  But the other child continued to suffer because they couldn't take the time off
[03:47:40.260 --> 03:47:42.100]  and relocate the family to go out there.
[03:47:42.100 --> 03:47:45.460]  And so what they did was, in Texas, in Texas of all places,
[03:47:46.180 --> 03:47:48.100]  the place where they love their drug war,
[03:47:48.740 --> 03:47:54.100]  they passed a medical marijuana exception for children who have epileptic seizures.
[03:47:54.100 --> 03:47:58.820]  Now, what is pharmaceutical, what's big pharmaceutical doing about this?
[03:47:58.820 --> 03:48:05.220]  Well, in the last year, 20,000 prescriptions for Rysperidone, commonly known as Rysperdal,
[03:48:05.860 --> 03:48:09.860]  and other anti-psychotic medications were written in 2014.
[03:48:09.860 --> 03:48:15.620]  That's a 50% jump in one year, giving them these hard core anti-psychotic medications,
[03:48:15.620 --> 03:48:17.460]  which I would say are psychotic medications.
[03:48:17.460 --> 03:48:19.620]  And this kid was seeing stuff that wasn't there.
[03:48:19.620 --> 03:48:20.580]  He's hallucinating.
[03:48:21.300 --> 03:48:24.580]  Okay, these are psychotic drugs, folks, are not anti-psychotic drugs.
[03:48:24.580 --> 03:48:29.940]  Also, prescriptions for Prozac to kids rose 23% in one year to 83,000.
[03:48:29.940 --> 03:48:31.060]  83,000.
[03:48:32.100 --> 03:48:33.460]  That's absolute insanity.
[03:48:33.460 --> 03:48:34.500]  And I pointed that out.
[03:48:34.500 --> 03:48:37.780]  Here we've got a situation where marijuana, medical marijuana,
[03:48:37.780 --> 03:48:44.660]  which could address the problem that is created by their vaccines, is prohibited.
[03:48:45.300 --> 03:48:50.420]  And then they inject our kids or give our kids these psychotic drugs.
[03:48:50.980 --> 03:48:55.620]  And then the update that I saw in this last night I go home and I look in on the Daily Mail.
[03:48:55.620 --> 03:48:56.260]  Here's this article.
[03:48:56.260 --> 03:48:58.420]  Could cannabis treat your child's epilepsy?
[03:48:58.420 --> 03:48:59.620]  Epilepsy, of course they could.
[03:48:59.620 --> 03:49:00.660]  We know that it can.
[03:49:00.660 --> 03:49:06.180]  Marijuana oil, they say, significantly reduces seizures and 50% of young sufferers.
[03:49:06.180 --> 03:49:07.860]  And this is a new study that's come out.
[03:49:07.860 --> 03:49:10.100]  And why are they talking about this now?
[03:49:10.100 --> 03:49:14.420]  Well, they're talking about it now because now they've patented it.
[03:49:15.060 --> 03:49:19.140]  Now they found a way to make money because you know what, folks, it's all about money.
[03:49:19.700 --> 03:49:21.220]  Vaccinating you is all about money.
[03:49:21.220 --> 03:49:22.100]  It's not about your health.
[03:49:22.660 --> 03:49:26.420]  Withholding the marijuana until they can find a way to make money off of it,
[03:49:26.420 --> 03:49:27.380]  that's all about the money.
[03:49:27.380 --> 03:49:28.580]  It's not about your health.
[03:49:28.580 --> 03:49:32.660]  The FDA setting up this drug protocol.
[03:49:32.660 --> 03:49:34.660]  It's all about protecting the drug companies.
[03:49:34.660 --> 03:49:36.180]  It's not about protecting your health.
[03:49:36.820 --> 03:49:37.860]  It's all about that.
[03:49:37.860 --> 03:49:39.940]  This drug is called Epidolex.
[03:49:39.940 --> 03:49:45.540]  It's a pharmaceutical liquid form of cannabis oil.
[03:49:45.540 --> 03:49:46.420]  I don't know how to pronounce that.
[03:49:46.420 --> 03:49:48.340]  See, I'm not really a pot guy.
[03:49:48.340 --> 03:49:50.900]  A lot of people say, oh, you're just a pothead.
[03:49:50.900 --> 03:49:54.180]  No, I don't like governments that break the law.
[03:49:54.180 --> 03:49:56.260]  I don't like governments using people.
[03:49:56.260 --> 03:49:58.180]  I don't like governments abusing us.
[03:49:58.820 --> 03:50:01.860]  I don't like the war on drugs because it's unconstitutional.
[03:50:01.860 --> 03:50:03.860]  We had to have a constitutional amendment for alcohol.
[03:50:03.860 --> 03:50:05.940]  Where's the constitutional amendment for marijuana,
[03:50:05.940 --> 03:50:08.820]  or any of the other drugs that they prohibit,
[03:50:08.820 --> 03:50:10.820]  including our cancer treatment.
[03:50:12.100 --> 03:50:15.140]  Now everything is prohibited unless expressly permitted
[03:50:15.140 --> 03:50:18.260]  by the Food and Drug Administration or the DEA.
[03:50:18.980 --> 03:50:21.300]  And that is a perversion, folks.
[03:50:21.300 --> 03:50:22.740]  It is a perversion.
[03:50:22.740 --> 03:50:23.860]  But that's what it's all about.
[03:50:23.860 --> 03:50:25.300]  It's all about the money.
[03:50:25.300 --> 03:50:31.380]  So now that they can find a way to patent marijuana and cannabis oil,
[03:50:31.380 --> 03:50:35.300]  now they'll tell you that it can help your child with epileptic seizures
[03:50:35.300 --> 03:50:38.180]  that are caused by their mandated vaccines.
[03:50:38.180 --> 03:51:04.100]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[03:51:08.180 --> 03:51:10.180]  We've tried our extraordinary product,
[03:51:10.180 --> 03:51:13.540]  and we're thrilled that the life-changing results people have.
[03:51:13.540 --> 03:51:18.100]  Our company email is continually full of happy, satisfied customers
[03:51:18.100 --> 03:51:21.780]  who thank us for the help they've received from Supernatural Silver.
[03:51:21.780 --> 03:51:25.460]  This holiday season, as you think of gifts to give your loved ones,
[03:51:25.460 --> 03:51:30.900]  consider giving Supernatural Silver a gift that can help provide good health and wellness.
[03:51:30.900 --> 03:51:35.460]  A gift that can change lives and make a real difference in a world
[03:51:35.460 --> 03:51:38.900]  where we are constantly exposed to dangerous health threats.
[03:51:38.900 --> 03:51:42.260]  Give yourself and your loved ones a fighting chance.
[03:51:42.260 --> 03:51:44.180]  Give Supernatural Silver.
[03:51:44.180 --> 03:51:50.660]  Go to SupernaturalSilver.com and use the promo code HOLIDAY2015 for 20% off.
[03:51:50.660 --> 03:51:55.540]  And this holiday season, we wish you and yours the blessings of peace and good health.
[03:51:55.540 --> 03:51:59.060]  From all of us here at SupernaturalSilver.com.
[03:52:00.020 --> 03:52:04.660]  We have been fighting this war tirelessly with you on our side, day in and day out,
[03:52:04.660 --> 03:52:08.260]  exposing ludicrous lies and criminal operations of the globalists,
[03:52:08.260 --> 03:52:10.580]  and we're starting to see big effects.
[03:52:10.580 --> 03:52:12.500]  And the word is getting out.
[03:52:12.500 --> 03:52:16.340]  The globalists want to make us dependent, and as Napoleon famously said,
[03:52:16.340 --> 03:52:18.260]  an army marches on its stomach.
[03:52:18.260 --> 03:52:23.780]  Ammunition, food, and supplies form the backbone of any offensive, including the Info War.
[03:52:23.780 --> 03:52:27.060]  And our enemies admit they're losing the Info War.
[03:52:27.060 --> 03:52:30.820]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[03:52:30.820 --> 03:52:35.860]  With this in mind, we have held strong to our principles and the decision to refuse any money
[03:52:35.860 --> 03:52:37.300]  from globalists or government.
[03:52:37.300 --> 03:52:41.220]  We are funding our crusade against tyranny the old fashioned way,
[03:52:41.220 --> 03:52:44.260]  with pure free market, free will capitalism.
[03:52:44.260 --> 03:52:49.060]  Visit infowarstore.com today, or call 888-253-3139,
[03:52:49.060 --> 03:52:52.180]  and take advantage of free shipping right through December 18th,
[03:52:52.180 --> 03:52:54.020]  and get your order before Christmas.
[03:52:54.020 --> 03:52:55.780]  May God bless you and your family,
[03:52:55.780 --> 03:52:59.700]  and keep us strong as we forge ahead in this battle for humanity.
[03:52:59.700 --> 03:53:02.820]  Still wondering what to get that special someone that has everything?
[03:53:02.820 --> 03:53:08.020]  At ID Stronghold, we still find that a huge percentage of people do not yet have an RFID
[03:53:08.020 --> 03:53:12.980]  blocking wallet or purse to protect them from the new and growing threat of electronic pickpocketing.
[03:53:12.980 --> 03:53:13.620]  That's right.
[03:53:13.620 --> 03:53:19.380]  Even though 40% of all new chipped payment cards shipped in 2014 contain a wireless interface
[03:53:19.380 --> 03:53:24.740]  called RFID that allows the account information to be skimmed by a thief passing near your cards,
[03:53:24.740 --> 03:53:26.740]  most people are still unprotected.
[03:53:26.740 --> 03:53:32.420]  The good news is that ID Stronghold makes luxurious leather wallets and other products that prevent this.
[03:53:32.420 --> 03:53:36.260]  ID Stronghold founded the entire RFID protection industry,
[03:53:36.260 --> 03:53:41.460]  and has been protecting the RFID chips in government and military ID cards for over a decade.
[03:53:41.460 --> 03:53:47.380]  So go to idstronghold.com, and get that loved one a stylish leather RFID blocking wallet or clutch.
[03:53:47.380 --> 03:53:49.380]  That's idstronghold.com.
[03:53:49.380 --> 03:53:52.340]  After all, wallets and purses have always been a great gift.
[03:53:52.340 --> 03:53:54.500]  Now, they are an even better gift.
[03:53:54.500 --> 03:53:57.300]  Visit idstronghold.com today.
[03:54:14.100 --> 03:54:15.940]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight.
[03:54:15.940 --> 03:54:19.940]  I've got several articles I want to run through here real quickly in this last segment here.
[03:54:19.940 --> 03:54:23.220]  A lot of different subjects that we haven't talked about for quite some time.
[03:54:23.220 --> 03:54:27.460]  Before we do real quickly, I want to tell you about our specials today on this December 11th.
[03:54:27.460 --> 03:54:29.220]  We have, of course, free shipping.
[03:54:29.220 --> 03:54:32.500]  That is the biggest special we've got going at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:54:32.500 --> 03:54:33.700]  But we've got other specials as well.
[03:54:33.700 --> 03:54:39.460]  We've got 28% off of a cleansing pack that's Deep Cleanse Living Defense and Oxy Powder.

[03:54:42.980 --> 03:54:45.060]  We have coffee. We've got a special on coffee.

[03:54:48.180 --> 03:54:49.220]  Great Christmas gift.

[03:54:53.380 --> 03:54:55.780]  Wake up America coffee. Gourmet coffee.

[03:54:57.700 --> 03:54:59.300]  We've got a lot of specials.
[03:54:59.300 --> 03:55:04.580]  We've got an Essentials Pack, Survival Shield X2, Super Male, Female, Vitality, and Silver Bullet.
[03:55:04.580 --> 03:55:06.340]  All three of those together, 33% off.
[03:55:06.340 --> 03:55:08.180]  And everything in the store, free shipping.
[03:55:09.460 --> 03:55:12.660]  Now, going to a quick news roundup that we've got here.
[03:55:12.660 --> 03:55:17.940]  There's a story. NPR talks about Bernie Sanders and how he has stuck to the same message for 40 years.
[03:55:17.940 --> 03:55:19.140]  And what would that message be?
[03:55:19.140 --> 03:55:23.380]  The message would be that we have a rigged economy.
[03:55:24.020 --> 03:55:26.820]  He wants to give us one that is completely rigged.
[03:55:26.820 --> 03:55:28.420]  It's called Socialism, folks.
[03:55:28.420 --> 03:55:33.540]  It's where somebody else makes all the decisions for you and you have no input whatsoever.
[03:55:33.540 --> 03:55:37.060]  Bernie Sanders loved the Nicaraguan Sandinistas, you know?
[03:55:37.060 --> 03:55:41.780]  And this message that he's had for the last 40 years is pure BS.
[03:55:42.340 --> 03:55:44.340]  It's pure Bernie Sanders Nista.
[03:55:44.900 --> 03:55:47.220]  It's exactly, that's what socialism is.
[03:55:47.220 --> 03:55:50.180]  It is nothing, he talks about unfair distribution of wealth.
[03:55:50.180 --> 03:55:53.060]  Look, he's going to distribute the wealth, okay?
[03:55:53.060 --> 03:55:55.940]  He's going to make the decisions who has money, who doesn't.
[03:55:55.940 --> 03:55:59.140]  Because he's all going to do it from his little central location.
[03:55:59.140 --> 03:56:04.260]  No, in a free market, we need to be looking at ways to actually get a free market
[03:56:04.260 --> 03:56:07.060]  instead of the crony capitalism that we know exists now.
[03:56:07.060 --> 03:56:08.740]  And how does crony capitalism work?
[03:56:08.740 --> 03:56:13.620]  Well, you don't have crony capitalism unless you give the government control over certain things.
[03:56:13.620 --> 03:56:17.060]  So if the government were to just act as a referee, you wouldn't have crony capitalism.
[03:56:17.060 --> 03:56:19.140]  The government enables crony capitalism.
[03:56:19.140 --> 03:56:21.940]  But he wants to use that then as a problem, just as we always see
[03:56:21.940 --> 03:56:24.100]  with the Democrats to take it to the next level.
[03:56:24.100 --> 03:56:27.940]  And he says, well, because we have unfair income distribution,
[03:56:27.940 --> 03:56:29.460]  I'm going to redistribute it.
[03:56:29.460 --> 03:56:30.980]  And you're not going to have a say so.
[03:56:30.980 --> 03:56:33.300]  You're not going to get to decide what you're going to buy,
[03:56:33.300 --> 03:56:35.700]  who you're going to buy it from, and what quantities you're going to buy it from.
[03:56:35.700 --> 03:56:38.260]  Yeah, we'll call that Obamacare, for example, okay?
[03:56:38.260 --> 03:56:39.380]  So he wants to do that everywhere.
[03:56:39.380 --> 03:56:42.340]  He wants to give everybody a free college education.
[03:56:42.340 --> 03:56:45.940]  Even people who aren't from this country get a free college education.
[03:56:45.940 --> 03:56:47.140]  Somebody's going to pay for it.
[03:56:47.140 --> 03:56:48.020]  You'll pay for it.
[03:56:48.020 --> 03:56:49.460]  You'll pay for it by losing your home.
[03:56:50.180 --> 03:56:56.660]  Another thing that's, of course, on the horizon here is this decision about net neutrality.
[03:56:56.660 --> 03:56:58.180]  And we can talk about net neutrality.
[03:56:58.180 --> 03:57:00.900]  Of course, the FCC has been on the side, both sides of this issue.
[03:57:00.900 --> 03:57:02.500]  It's really not about net neutrality at all.
[03:57:02.500 --> 03:57:06.100]  It's really about who's going to have control of the internet.
[03:57:06.100 --> 03:57:08.100]  And what does it boil down to is this.
[03:57:08.740 --> 03:57:12.660]  We've got a trial that's going on right now in a district court, a federal district court.
[03:57:12.660 --> 03:57:18.980]  And it's really three unaccountable, unelected judges in this district court versus three out
[03:57:18.980 --> 03:57:24.980]  of five unelected, unaccountable FCC commissioners who want to make the internet their new little
[03:57:24.980 --> 03:57:26.180]  empire zone.
[03:57:26.180 --> 03:57:30.180]  And we remember that when they first came to the court, the court turned down once before,
[03:57:30.180 --> 03:57:32.260]  said, no, you can't regulate the internet, it's content.
[03:57:32.260 --> 03:57:34.660]  So then the FCC went back and said, you know what?
[03:57:34.660 --> 03:57:37.220]  We just declared the internet to be a utility.
[03:57:37.220 --> 03:57:39.220]  And the court said, okay, you can do that.
[03:57:39.220 --> 03:57:41.540]  But now they're looking at it and they said, but wait a minute.
[03:57:41.540 --> 03:57:45.940]  You've got different rules for wireless and for wired aspects of the internet.
[03:57:45.940 --> 03:57:47.540]  So now they're trying to work out that.
[03:57:47.540 --> 03:57:51.140]  They're trying to figure out how many angels there are in the head of that pen.
[03:57:51.860 --> 03:57:57.140]  We need to get past the idea that three judges can decide the internet for us.
[03:57:57.140 --> 03:57:59.300]  And here's the kicker, the very first judge.
[03:57:59.300 --> 03:58:01.140]  This is a Washington Post story when I talked about this.
[03:58:01.140 --> 03:58:03.540]  Three judges hold the fate of the internet in their hands.
[03:58:03.540 --> 03:58:04.500]  That's the headline.
[03:58:04.500 --> 03:58:10.020]  The first judge, and I can't even pronounce his name, Sri Srinivis Vasanath.
[03:58:10.020 --> 03:58:11.620]  He's from India.
[03:58:11.620 --> 03:58:14.420]  We've got H-1B visa judges coming down.
[03:58:14.420 --> 03:58:18.420]  They say he is reportedly on the Democrat Party's shortlist for Supreme Court nominees.
[03:58:18.420 --> 03:58:20.420]  He's worked for the Bushes, he's worked for Exxon.
[03:58:20.420 --> 03:58:22.420]  Of course, both sides love him.
[03:58:22.420 --> 03:58:24.020]  He's not even an American citizen.
[03:58:24.020 --> 03:58:25.620]  He's going to decide the internet for you.
[03:58:25.620 --> 03:58:27.220]  That's the kind of trouble we're in.
[03:58:27.220 --> 03:58:28.420]  Stay with us tonight.
[03:58:28.420 --> 03:58:32.020]  We're going to have the Infowars Nightly News at 7th Central, 8 p.m. Eastern.
[03:58:32.020 --> 03:58:33.220]  Leanne McAdoo will be hosting.
[03:58:33.220 --> 03:58:34.420]  That's it for our radio program.
[03:58:34.420 --> 03:58:40.420]  Thanks for joining us.
